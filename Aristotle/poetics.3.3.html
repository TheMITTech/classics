<A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A><B>Part XXI</B>
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="11"></A>Words are of two kinds, simple and double. By simple I mean those composed 
<A NAME="12"></A>of nonsignificant elements, such as ge, 'earth.' By double or compound, 
<A NAME="13"></A>those composed either of a significant and nonsignificant element (though 
<A NAME="14"></A>within the whole word no element is significant), or of elements that are 
<A NAME="15"></A>both significant. A word may likewise be triple, quadruple, or multiple 
<A NAME="16"></A>in form, like so many Massilian expressions, e.g., 'Hermo-caico-xanthus 
<A NAME="17"></A>[who prayed to Father Zeus].'
<A NAME="18"></A><BR><BR>Every word is either current, or strange, or metaphorical, or ornamental, 
<A NAME="19"></A>or newly-coined, or lengthened, or contracted, or altered.
<A NAME="20"></A><BR><BR>By a current or proper word I mean one which is in general use 
<A NAME="21"></A>among a people; by a strange word, one which is in use in another country. 
<A NAME="22"></A>Plainly, therefore, the same word may be at once strange and current, but 
<A NAME="23"></A>not in relation to the same people. The word sigynon, 'lance,' is to the 
<A NAME="24"></A>Cyprians a current term but to us a strange one.
<A NAME="25"></A><BR><BR>Metaphor is the application of an alien name by transference either 
<A NAME="26"></A>from genus to species, or from species to genus, or from species to species, 
<A NAME="27"></A>or by analogy, that is, proportion. Thus from genus to species, as: 'There 
<A NAME="28"></A>lies my ship'; for lying at anchor is a species of lying. From species 
<A NAME="29"></A>to genus, as: 'Verily ten thousand noble deeds hath Odysseus wrought'; 
<A NAME="30"></A>for ten thousand is a species of large number, and is here used for a large 
<A NAME="31"></A>number generally. From species to species, as: 'With blade of bronze drew 
<A NAME="32"></A>away the life,' and 'Cleft the water with the vessel of unyielding bronze.' 
<A NAME="33"></A>Here arusai, 'to draw away' is used for tamein, 'to cleave,' and tamein, 
<A NAME="34"></A>again for arusai- each being a species of taking away. Analogy or proportion 
<A NAME="35"></A>is when the second term is to the first as the fourth to the third. We 
<A NAME="36"></A>may then use the fourth for the second, or the second for the fourth. Sometimes 
<A NAME="37"></A>too we qualify the metaphor by adding the term to which the proper word 
<A NAME="38"></A>is relative. Thus the cup is to Dionysus as the shield to Ares. The cup 
<A NAME="39"></A>may, therefore, be called 'the shield of Dionysus,' and the shield 'the 
<A NAME="40"></A>cup of Ares.' Or, again, as old age is to life, so is evening to day. Evening 
<A NAME="41"></A>may therefore be called, 'the old age of the day,' and old age, 'the evening 
<A NAME="42"></A>of life,' or, in the phrase of Empedocles, 'life's setting sun.' For some 
<A NAME="43"></A>of the terms of the proportion there is at times no word in existence; 
<A NAME="44"></A>still the metaphor may be used. For instance, to scatter seed is called 
<A NAME="45"></A>sowing: but the action of the sun in scattering his rays is nameless. Still 
<A NAME="46"></A>this process bears to the sun the same relation as sowing to the seed. 
<A NAME="47"></A>Hence the expression of the poet 'sowing the god-created light.' There 
<A NAME="48"></A>is another way in which this kind of metaphor may be employed. We may apply 
<A NAME="49"></A>an alien term, and then deny of that term one of its proper attributes; 
<A NAME="50"></A>as if we were to call the shield, not 'the cup of Ares,' but 'the wineless 
<A NAME="51"></A>cup'.
<A NAME="52"></A><BR><BR>A newly-coined word is one which has never been even in local use, 
<A NAME="53"></A>but is adopted by the poet himself. Some such words there appear to be: 
<A NAME="54"></A>as ernyges, 'sprouters,' for kerata, 'horns'; and areter, 'supplicator', 
<A NAME="55"></A>for hiereus, 'priest.'
<A NAME="56"></A><BR><BR>A word is lengthened when its own vowel is exchanged for a longer 
<A NAME="57"></A>one, or when a syllable is inserted. A word is contracted when some part 
<A NAME="58"></A>of it is removed. Instances of lengthening are: poleos for poleos, Peleiadeo 
<A NAME="59"></A>for Peleidou; of contraction: kri, do, and ops, as in mia ginetai amphoteron 
<A NAME="60"></A>ops, 'the appearance of both is one.'
<A NAME="61"></A><BR><BR>An altered word is one in which part of the ordinary form is left 
<A NAME="62"></A>unchanged, and part is recast: as in dexiteron kata mazon, 'on the right 
<A NAME="63"></A>breast,' dexiteron is for dexion.
<A NAME="64"></A><BR><BR>Nouns in themselves are either masculine, feminine, or neuter. 
<A NAME="65"></A>Masculine are such as end in N, R, S, or in some letter compounded with 
<A NAME="66"></A>S- these being two, PS and X. Feminine, such as end in vowels that are 
<A NAME="67"></A>always long, namely E and O, and- of vowels that admit of lengthening- 
<A NAME="68"></A>those in A. Thus the number of letters in which nouns masculine and feminine 
<A NAME="69"></A>end is the same; for PS and X are equivalent to endings in S. No noun ends 
<A NAME="70"></A>in a mute or a vowel short by nature. Three only end in I- meli, 'honey'; 
<A NAME="71"></A>kommi, 'gum'; peperi, 'pepper'; five end in U. Neuter nouns end in these 
<A NAME="72"></A>two latter vowels; also in N and S.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="73"></A><B>Part XXII</B>

<A NAME="74"></A><BR><BR>The perfection of style is to be clear without being mean. The 
<A NAME="75"></A>clearest style is that which uses only current or proper words; at the 
<A NAME="76"></A>same time it is mean- witness the poetry of Cleophon and of Sthenelus. 
<A NAME="77"></A>That diction, on the other hand, is lofty and raised above the commonplace 
<A NAME="78"></A>which employs unusual words. By unusual, I mean strange (or rare) words, 
<A NAME="79"></A>metaphorical, lengthened- anything, in short, that differs from the normal 
<A NAME="80"></A>idiom. Yet a style wholly composed of such words is either a riddle or 
<A NAME="81"></A>a jargon; a riddle, if it consists of metaphors; a jargon, if it consists 
<A NAME="82"></A>of strange (or rare) words. For the essence of a riddle is to express true 
<A NAME="83"></A>facts under impossible combinations. Now this cannot be done  by any arrangement 
<A NAME="84"></A>of ordinary words, but by the use of metaphor it can. Such is the riddle: 
<A NAME="85"></A>'A man I saw who on another man had glued the bronze by aid of fire,' and 
<A NAME="86"></A>others of the same kind. A diction that is made up of strange (or rare) 
<A NAME="87"></A>terms is a jargon. A certain infusion, therefore, of these elements is 
<A NAME="88"></A>necessary to style; for the strange (or rare) word, the metaphorical, the 
<A NAME="89"></A>ornamental, and the other kinds above mentioned, will raise it above the 
<A NAME="90"></A>commonplace and mean, while the use of proper words will make it perspicuous. 
<A NAME="91"></A>But nothing contributes more to produce a cleanness of diction that is 
<A NAME="92"></A>remote from commonness than the lengthening, contraction, and alteration 
<A NAME="93"></A>of words. For by deviating in exceptional cases from the normal idiom, 
<A NAME="94"></A>the language will gain distinction; while, at the same time, the partial 
<A NAME="95"></A>conformity with usage will give perspicuity. The critics, therefore, are 
<A NAME="96"></A>in error who censure these licenses of speech, and hold the author up to 
<A NAME="97"></A>ridicule. Thus Eucleides, the elder, declared that it would be an easy 
<A NAME="98"></A>matter to be a poet if you might lengthen syllables at will. He caricatured 
<A NAME="99"></A>the practice in the very form of his diction, as in the verse: <BR><BR>"Epicharen 
<A NAME="100"></A>eidon Marathonade badizonta, <BR><BR>"I saw Epichares walking to Marathon, 
<A NAME="101"></A>"<BR><BR>
<A NAME="102"></A>or, <BR><BR>"ouk an g'eramenos ton ekeinou elleboron. <BR><BR>"Not if you 
<A NAME="103"></A>desire his hellebore. "<BR><BR>
<A NAME="104"></A>To employ such license at all obtrusively is, no doubt, grotesque; but 
<A NAME="105"></A>in any mode of poetic diction there must be moderation. Even metaphors, 
<A NAME="106"></A>strange (or rare) words, or any similar forms of speech, would produce 
<A NAME="107"></A>the like effect if used without propriety and with the express purpose 
<A NAME="108"></A>of being ludicrous. How great a difference is made by the appropriate use 
<A NAME="109"></A>of lengthening, may be seen in Epic poetry by the insertion of ordinary 
<A NAME="110"></A>forms in the verse. So, again, if we take a strange (or rare) word, a metaphor, 
<A NAME="111"></A>or any similar mode of expression, and replace it by the current or proper 
<A NAME="112"></A>term, the truth of our observation will be manifest. For example, Aeschylus 
<A NAME="113"></A>and Euripides each composed the same iambic line. But the alteration of 
<A NAME="114"></A>a single word by Euripides, who employed the rarer term instead of the 
<A NAME="115"></A>ordinary one, makes one verse appear beautiful and the other trivial. Aeschylus 
<A NAME="116"></A>in his Philoctetes says: <BR><BR>"phagedaina d'he mou sarkas esthiei podos. 
<A NAME="117"></A><BR><BR>"The tumor which is eating the flesh of my foot. 
<A NAME="118"></A>"<BR><BR>
<A NAME="119"></A>Euripides substitutes thoinatai, 'feasts on,' for esthiei, 'feeds on.' 
<A NAME="120"></A>Again, in the line, <BR><BR>"nun de m'eon oligos te kai outidanos kai aeikes, 
<A NAME="121"></A><BR><BR>"Yet a small man, worthless and unseemly, "<BR><BR>
<A NAME="122"></A>the difference will be felt if we substitute the common words, <BR><BR>"nun 
<A NAME="123"></A>de m'eon mikros te kai asthenikos kai aeides. <BR><BR>"Yet a little fellow, 
<A NAME="124"></A>weak and ugly. "<BR><BR>
<A NAME="125"></A>Or, if for the line, <BR><BR>"diphron aeikelion katatheis oligen te trapezan, 
<A NAME="126"></A><BR><BR>"Setting an unseemly couch and a meager table, 
<A NAME="127"></A>"<BR><BR>
<A NAME="128"></A>we read, <BR><BR>"diphron mochtheron katatheis mikran te trapezan. <BR><BR>"Setting 
<A NAME="129"></A>a wretched couch and a puny table. "<BR><BR>
<A NAME="130"></A>Or, for eiones booosin, 'the sea shores roar,' eiones krazousin, 'the sea 
<A NAME="131"></A>shores screech.'
<A NAME="132"></A><BR><BR>Again, Ariphrades ridiculed the tragedians for using phrases which 
<A NAME="133"></A>no one would employ in ordinary speech: for example, domaton apo, 'from 
<A NAME="134"></A>the house away,' instead of apo domaton, 'away from the house;' sethen, 
<A NAME="135"></A>ego de nin, 'to thee, and I to him;' Achilleos peri, 'Achilles about,' 
<A NAME="136"></A>instead of peri Achilleos, 'about Achilles;' and the like. It is precisely 
<A NAME="137"></A>because such phrases are not part of the current idiom that they give distinction 
<A NAME="138"></A>to the style. This, however, he failed to see.
<A NAME="139"></A><BR><BR>It is a great matter to observe propriety in these several modes 
<A NAME="140"></A>of expression, as also in compound words, strange (or rare) words, and 
<A NAME="141"></A>so forth. But the greatest thing by far is to have a command of metaphor. 
<A NAME="142"></A>This alone cannot be imparted by another; it is the mark of genius, for 
<A NAME="143"></A>to make good metaphors implies an eye for resemblances.
<A NAME="144"></A><BR><BR>Of the various kinds of words, the compound are best adapted to 
<A NAME="145"></A>dithyrambs, rare words to heroic poetry, metaphors to iambic. In heroic 
<A NAME="146"></A>poetry, indeed, all these varieties are serviceable. But in iambic verse, 
<A NAME="147"></A>which reproduces, as far as may be, familiar speech, the most appropriate 
<A NAME="148"></A>words are those which are found even in prose. These are the current or 
<A NAME="149"></A>proper, the metaphorical, the ornamental.
<A NAME="150"></A><BR><BR>Concerning Tragedy and imitation by means of action this may 
<A NAME="151"></A>suffice.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="152"></A><B>Part XXIII</B>

<A NAME="153"></A><BR><BR>As to that poetic imitation which is narrative in form and employs 
<A NAME="154"></A>a single meter, the plot manifestly ought, as in a tragedy, to be constructed 
<A NAME="155"></A>on dramatic principles. It should have for its subject a single action, 
<A NAME="156"></A>whole and complete, with a beginning, a middle, and an end. It will thus 
<A NAME="157"></A>resemble a living organism in all its unity, and produce the pleasure proper 
<A NAME="158"></A>to it. It will differ in structure from historical compositions, which 
<A NAME="159"></A>of necessity present not a single action, but a single period, and all 
<A NAME="160"></A>that happened within that period to one person or to many, little connected 
<A NAME="161"></A>together as the events may be. For as the sea-fight at Salamis and the 
<A NAME="162"></A>battle with the Carthaginians in Sicily took place at the same time, but 
<A NAME="163"></A>did not tend to any one result, so in the sequence of events, one thing 
<A NAME="164"></A>sometimes follows another, and yet no single result is thereby produced. 
<A NAME="165"></A>Such is the practice, we may say, of most poets. Here again, then, as has 
<A NAME="166"></A>been already observed, the transcendent excellence of Homer is manifest. 
<A NAME="167"></A>He never attempts to make the whole war of Troy the subject of his poem, 
<A NAME="168"></A>though that war had a beginning and an end. It would have been too vast 
<A NAME="169"></A>a theme, and not easily embraced in a single view. If, again, he had kept 
<A NAME="170"></A>it within moderate limits, it must have been over-complicated by the variety 
<A NAME="171"></A>of the incidents. As it is, he detaches a single portion, and admits as 
<A NAME="172"></A>episodes many events from the general story of the war- such as the Catalogue 
<A NAME="173"></A>of the ships and others- thus diversifying the poem. All other poets take 
<A NAME="174"></A>a single hero, a single period, or an action single indeed, but with a 
<A NAME="175"></A>multiplicity of parts. Thus did the author of the Cypria and of the Little 
<A NAME="176"></A>Iliad. For this reason the Iliad and the Odyssey each furnish the subject 
<A NAME="177"></A>of one tragedy, or, at most, of two; while the Cypria supplies materials 
<A NAME="178"></A>for many, and the Little Iliad for eight- the Award of the Arms, the Philoctetes, 
<A NAME="179"></A>the Neoptolemus, the Eurypylus, the Mendicant Odysseus, the Laconian Women, 
<A NAME="180"></A>the Fall of Ilium, the Departure of the Fleet.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="181"></A><B>Part XXIV</B>

<A NAME="182"></A><BR><BR>Again, Epic poetry must have as many kinds as Tragedy: it must 
<A NAME="183"></A>be simple, or complex, or 'ethical,'or 'pathetic.' The parts also, with 
<A NAME="184"></A>the exception of song and spectacle, are the same; for it requires Reversals 
<A NAME="185"></A>of the Situation, Recognitions, and Scenes of Suffering. Moreover, the 
<A NAME="186"></A>thoughts and the diction must be artistic. In all these respects Homer 
<A NAME="187"></A>is our earliest and sufficient model. Indeed each of his poems has a twofold 
<A NAME="188"></A>character. The Iliad is at once simple and 'pathetic,' and the Odyssey 
<A NAME="189"></A>complex (for Recognition scenes run through it), and at the same time 'ethical.' 
<A NAME="190"></A>Moreover, in diction and thought they are supreme.
<A NAME="191"></A><BR><BR>Epic poetry differs from Tragedy in the scale on which it is constructed, 
<A NAME="192"></A>and in its meter. As regards scale or length, we have already laid down 
<A NAME="193"></A>an adequate limit: the beginning and the end must be capable of being brought 
<A NAME="194"></A>within a single view. This condition will be satisfied by poems on a smaller 
<A NAME="195"></A>scale than the old epics, and answering in length to the group of tragedies 
<A NAME="196"></A>presented at a single sitting.
<A NAME="197"></A><BR><BR>Epic poetry has, however, a great- a special- capacity for enlarging 
<A NAME="198"></A>its dimensions, and we can see the reason. In Tragedy we cannot imitate 
<A NAME="199"></A>several lines of actions carried on at one and the same time; we must confine 
<A NAME="200"></A>ourselves to the action on the stage and the part taken by the players. 
<A NAME="201"></A>But in Epic poetry, owing to the narrative form, many events simultaneously 
<A NAME="202"></A>transacted can be presented; and these, if relevant to the subject, add 
<A NAME="203"></A>mass and dignity to the poem. The Epic has here an advantage, and one that 
<A NAME="204"></A>conduces to grandeur of effect, to diverting the mind of the hearer, and 
<A NAME="205"></A>relieving the story with varying episodes. For sameness of incident soon 
<A NAME="206"></A>produces satiety, and makes tragedies fail on the stage.
<A NAME="207"></A><BR><BR>As for the meter, the heroic measure has proved its fitness by 
<A NAME="208"></A>hexameter test of experience. If a narrative poem in any other meter or 
<A NAME="209"></A>in many meters were now composed, it would be found incongruous. For of 
<A NAME="210"></A>all measures the heroic is the stateliest and the most massive; and hence 
<A NAME="211"></A>it most readily admits rare words and metaphors, which is another point 
<A NAME="212"></A>in which the narrative form of imitation stands alone. On the other hand, 
<A NAME="213"></A>the iambic and the trochaic tetrameter are stirring measures, the latter 
<A NAME="214"></A>being akin to dancing, the former expressive of action. Still more absurd 
<A NAME="215"></A>would it be to mix together different meters, as was done  by Chaeremon. 
<A NAME="216"></A>Hence no one has ever composed a poem on a great scale in any other than 
<A NAME="217"></A> heroic verse. Nature herself, as we have said, teaches the choice of the 
<A NAME="218"></A>proper measure.
<A NAME="219"></A><BR><BR>Homer, admirable in all respects, has the special merit of being 
<A NAME="220"></A>the only poet who rightly appreciates the part he should take himself. 
<A NAME="221"></A>The poet should speak as little as possible in his own person, for it is 
<A NAME="222"></A>not this that makes him an imitator. Other poets appear themselves upon 
<A NAME="223"></A>the scene throughout, and imitate but little and rarely. Homer, after a 
<A NAME="224"></A>few prefatory words, at once brings in a man, or woman, or other personage; 
<A NAME="225"></A>none of them wanting in characteristic qualities, but each with a character 
<A NAME="226"></A>of his own.
<A NAME="227"></A><BR><BR>The element of the wonderful is required in Tragedy. The irrational, 
<A NAME="228"></A>on which the wonderful depends for its chief effects, has wider scope in 
<A NAME="229"></A>Epic poetry, because there the person acting is not seen. Thus, the pursuit 
<A NAME="230"></A>of Hector would be ludicrous if placed upon the stage- the Greeks standing 
<A NAME="231"></A>still and not joining in the pursuit, and Achilles waving them back. But 
<A NAME="232"></A>in the Epic poem the absurdity passes unnoticed. Now the wonderful is pleasing, 
<A NAME="233"></A>as may be inferred from the fact that every one tells a story with some 
<A NAME="234"></A>addition of his knowing that his hearers like it. It is Homer who has chiefly 
<A NAME="235"></A>taught other poets the art of telling lies skilfully. The secret of it 
<A NAME="236"></A>lies in a fallacy For, assuming that if one thing is or becomes, a second 
<A NAME="237"></A>is or becomes, men imagine that, if the second is, the first likewise is 
<A NAME="238"></A>or becomes. But this is a false inference. Hence, where the first thing 
<A NAME="239"></A>is untrue, it is quite unnecessary, provided the second be true, to add 
<A NAME="240"></A>that the first is or has become. For the mind, knowing the second to be 
<A NAME="241"></A>true, falsely infers the truth of the first. There is an example of this 
<A NAME="242"></A>in the Bath Scene of the Odyssey.
<A NAME="243"></A><BR><BR>Accordingly, the poet should prefer probable impossibilities to 
<A NAME="244"></A>improbable possibilities. The tragic plot must not be composed of irrational 
<A NAME="245"></A>parts. Everything irrational should, if possible, be excluded; or, at all 
<A NAME="246"></A>events, it should lie outside the action of the play (as, in the Oedipus, 
<A NAME="247"></A>the hero's ignorance as to the manner of Laius' death); not within the 
<A NAME="248"></A>drama- as in the Electra, the messenger's account of the Pythian games; 
<A NAME="249"></A>or, as in the Mysians, the man who has come from Tegea to Mysia and is 
<A NAME="250"></A>still speechless. The plea that otherwise the plot would have been ruined, 
<A NAME="251"></A>is ridiculous; such a plot should not in the first instance be constructed. 
<A NAME="252"></A>But once the irrational has been introduced and an air of likelihood imparted 
<A NAME="253"></A>to it, we must accept it in spite of the absurdity. Take even the irrational 
<A NAME="254"></A>incidents in the Odyssey, where Odysseus is left upon the shore of Ithaca. 
<A NAME="255"></A>How intolerable even these might have been would be apparent if an inferior 
<A NAME="256"></A>poet were to treat the subject. As it is, the absurdity is veiled by the 
<A NAME="257"></A>poetic charm with which the poet invests it.
<A NAME="258"></A><BR><BR>The diction should be elaborated in the pauses of the action, where 
<A NAME="259"></A>there is no expression of character or thought. For, conversely, character 
<A NAME="260"></A>and thought are merely obscured by a diction that is 
<A NAME="261"></A>over-brilliant
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="262"></A><B>Part XXV</B>

<A NAME="263"></A><BR><BR>With respect to critical difficulties and their solutions, the 
<A NAME="264"></A>number and nature of the sources from which they may be drawn may be thus 
<A NAME="265"></A>exhibited.
<A NAME="266"></A><BR><BR>The poet being an imitator, like a painter or any other artist, 
<A NAME="267"></A>must of necessity imitate one of three objects- things as they were or 
<A NAME="268"></A>are, things as they are said or thought to be, or things as they ought 
<A NAME="269"></A>to be. The vehicle of expression is language- either current terms or, 
<A NAME="270"></A>it may be, rare words or metaphors. There are also many modifications of 
<A NAME="271"></A>language, which we concede to the poets. Add to this, that the standard 
<A NAME="272"></A>of correctness is not the same in poetry and politics, any more than in 
<A NAME="273"></A>poetry and any other art. Within the art of poetry itself there are two 
<A NAME="274"></A>kinds of faults- those which touch its essence, and those which are accidental. 
<A NAME="275"></A>If a poet has chosen to imitate something, [but has imitated it incorrectly] 
<A NAME="276"></A>through want of capacity, the error is inherent in the poetry. But if the 
<A NAME="277"></A>failure is due to a wrong choice- if he has represented a horse as throwing 
<A NAME="278"></A>out both his off legs at once, or introduced technical inaccuracies in 
<A NAME="279"></A>medicine, for example, or in any other art- the error is not essential 
<A NAME="280"></A>to the poetry. These are the points of view from which we should consider 
<A NAME="281"></A>and answer the objections raised by the critics.
<A NAME="282"></A><BR><BR>First as to matters which concern the poet's own art. If he describes 
<A NAME="283"></A>the impossible, he is guilty of an error; but the error may be justified, 
<A NAME="284"></A>if the end of the art be thereby attained (the end being that already mentioned)- 
<A NAME="285"></A>if, that is, the effect of this or any other part of the poem is thus rendered 
<A NAME="286"></A>more striking. A case in point is the pursuit of Hector. if, however, the 
<A NAME="287"></A>end might have been as well, or better, attained without violating the 
<A NAME="288"></A>special rules of the poetic art, the error is not justified: for every 
<A NAME="289"></A>kind of error should, if possible, be avoided.
<A NAME="290"></A><BR><BR>Again, does the error touch the essentials of the poetic art, or 
<A NAME="291"></A>some accident of it? For example, not to know that a hind has no horns 
<A NAME="292"></A>is a less serious matter than to paint it inartistically.
<A NAME="293"></A><BR><BR>Further, if it be objected that the description is not true to 
<A NAME="294"></A>fact, the poet may perhaps reply, 'But the objects are as they ought to 
<A NAME="295"></A>be'; just as Sophocles said that he drew men as they ought to be; Euripides, 
<A NAME="296"></A>as they are. In this way the objection may be met. If, however, the representation 
<A NAME="297"></A>be of neither kind, the poet may answer, 'This is how men say the thing 
<A NAME="298"></A>is.' applies to tales about the gods. It may well be that these stories 
<A NAME="299"></A>are not higher than fact nor yet true to fact: they are, very possibly, 
<A NAME="300"></A>what Xenophanes says of them. But anyhow, 'this is what is said.' Again, 
<A NAME="301"></A>a description may be no better than the fact: 'Still, it was the fact'; 
<A NAME="302"></A>as in the passage about the arms: 'Upright upon their butt-ends stood the 
<A NAME="303"></A>spears.' This was the custom then, as it now is among the 
<A NAME="304"></A>Illyrians.
<A NAME="305"></A><BR><BR>Again, in examining whether what has been said or done  by some 
<A NAME="306"></A>one is poetically right or not, we must not look merely to the particular 
<A NAME="307"></A>act or saying, and ask whether it is poetically good or bad. We must also 
<A NAME="308"></A>consider by whom it is said or done, to whom, when, by what means, or for 
<A NAME="309"></A>what end; whether, for instance, it be to secure a greater good, or avert 
<A NAME="310"></A>a greater evil.
<A NAME="311"></A><BR><BR>Other difficulties may be resolved by due regard to the usage of 
<A NAME="312"></A>language. We may note a rare word, as in oureas men proton, 'the mules 
<A NAME="313"></A>first [he killed],' where the poet perhaps employs oureas not in the sense 
<A NAME="314"></A>of mules, but of sentinels. So, again, of Dolon: 'ill-favored indeed he 
<A NAME="315"></A>was to look upon.' It is not meant that his body was ill-shaped but that 
<A NAME="316"></A>his face was ugly; for the Cretans use the word eueides, 'well-flavored' 
<A NAME="317"></A>to denote a fair face. Again, zoroteron de keraie, 'mix the drink livelier' 
<A NAME="318"></A>does not mean 'mix it stronger' as for hard drinkers, but 'mix it 
<A NAME="319"></A>quicker.'
<A NAME="320"></A><BR><BR>Sometimes an expression is metaphorical, as 'Now all gods and men 
<A NAME="321"></A>were sleeping through the night,' while at the same time the poet says: 
<A NAME="322"></A>'Often indeed as he turned his gaze to the Trojan plain, he marveled at 
<A NAME="323"></A>the sound of flutes and pipes.' 'All' is here used metaphorically for 'many,' 
<A NAME="324"></A>all being a species of many. So in the verse, 'alone she hath no part... 
<A NAME="325"></A>, oie, 'alone' is metaphorical; for the best known may be called the only 
<A NAME="326"></A>one.
<A NAME="327"></A><BR><BR>Again, the solution may depend upon accent or breathing. Thus Hippias 
<A NAME="328"></A>of Thasos solved the difficulties in the lines, didomen (didomen) de hoi, 
<A NAME="329"></A>and to men hou (ou) kataputhetai ombro.
<A NAME="330"></A><BR><BR>Or again, the question may be solved by punctuation, as in Empedocles: 
<A NAME="331"></A>'Of a sudden things became mortal that before had learnt to be immortal, 
<A NAME="332"></A>and things unmixed before mixed.'
<A NAME="333"></A><BR><BR>Or again, by ambiguity of meaning, as parocheken de pleo nux, where 
<A NAME="334"></A>the word pleo is ambiguous.
<A NAME="335"></A><BR><BR>Or by the usage of language. Thus any mixed drink is called oinos, 
<A NAME="336"></A>'wine'. Hence Ganymede is said 'to pour the wine to Zeus,' though the gods 
<A NAME="337"></A>do not drink wine. So too workers in iron are called chalkeas, or 'workers 
<A NAME="338"></A>in bronze.' This, however, may also be taken as a metaphor.
<A NAME="339"></A><BR><BR>Again, when a word seems to involve some inconsistency of meaning, 
<A NAME="340"></A>we should consider how many senses it may bear in the particular passage. 
<A NAME="341"></A>For example: 'there was stayed the spear of bronze'- we should ask in how 
<A NAME="342"></A>many ways we may take 'being checked there.' The true mode of interpretation 
<A NAME="343"></A>is the precise opposite of what Glaucon mentions. Critics, he says, jump 
<A NAME="344"></A>at certain groundless conclusions; they pass adverse judgement and then 
<A NAME="345"></A>proceed to reason on it; and, assuming that the poet has said whatever 
<A NAME="346"></A>they happen to think, find fault if a thing is inconsistent with their 
<A NAME="347"></A>own fancy.
<A NAME="348"></A><BR><BR>The question about Icarius has been treated in this fashion. The 
<A NAME="349"></A>critics imagine he was a Lacedaemonian. They think it strange, therefore, 
<A NAME="350"></A>that Telemachus should not have met him when he went to Lacedaemon. But 
<A NAME="351"></A>the Cephallenian story may perhaps be the true one. They allege that Odysseus 
<A NAME="352"></A>took a wife from among themselves, and that her father was Icadius, not 
<A NAME="353"></A>Icarius. It is merely a mistake, then, that gives plausibility to the 
<A NAME="354"></A>objection.
<A NAME="355"></A><BR><BR>In general, the impossible must be justified by reference to artistic 
<A NAME="356"></A>requirements, or to the higher reality, or to received opinion. With respect 
<A NAME="357"></A>to the requirements of art, a probable impossibility is to be preferred 
<A NAME="358"></A>to a thing improbable and yet possible. Again, it may be impossible that 
<A NAME="359"></A>there should be men such as Zeuxis painted. 'Yes,' we say, 'but the impossible 
<A NAME="360"></A>is the higher thing; for the ideal type must surpass the realty.' To justify 
<A NAME="361"></A>the irrational, we appeal to what is commonly said to be. In addition to 
<A NAME="362"></A>which, we urge that the irrational sometimes does not violate reason; just 
<A NAME="363"></A>as 'it is probable that a thing may happen contrary to 
<A NAME="364"></A>probability.'
<A NAME="365"></A><BR><BR>Things that sound contradictory should be examined by the same 
<A NAME="366"></A>rules as in dialectical refutation- whether the same thing is meant, in 
<A NAME="367"></A>the same relation, and in the same sense. We should therefore solve the 
<A NAME="368"></A>question by reference to what the poet says himself, or to what is tacitly 
<A NAME="369"></A>assumed by a person of intelligence.
<A NAME="370"></A><BR><BR>The element of the irrational, and, similarly, depravity of character, 
<A NAME="371"></A>are justly censured when there is no inner necessity for introducing them. 
<A NAME="372"></A>Such is the irrational element in the introduction of Aegeus by Euripides 
<A NAME="373"></A>and the badness of Menelaus in the Orestes.
<A NAME="374"></A><BR><BR>Thus, there are five sources from which critical objections are 
<A NAME="375"></A>drawn. Things are censured either as impossible, or irrational, or morally 
<A NAME="376"></A>hurtful, or contradictory, or contrary to artistic correctness. The answers 
<A NAME="377"></A>should be sought under the twelve heads above mentioned.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="378"></A><B>Part XXVI</B>

<A NAME="379"></A><BR><BR>The question may be raised whether the Epic or Tragic mode of imitation 
<A NAME="380"></A>is the higher. If the more refined art is the higher, and the more refined 
<A NAME="381"></A>in every case is that which appeals to the better sort of audience, the 
<A NAME="382"></A>art which imitates anything and everything is manifestly most unrefined. 
<A NAME="383"></A>The audience is supposed to be too dull to comprehend unless something 
<A NAME="384"></A>of their own is thrown by the performers, who therefore indulge in restless 
<A NAME="385"></A>movements. Bad flute-players twist and twirl, if they have to represent 
<A NAME="386"></A>'the quoit-throw,' or hustle the coryphaeus when they perform the Scylla. 
<A NAME="387"></A>Tragedy, it is said, has this same defect. We may compare the opinion that 
<A NAME="388"></A>the older actors entertained of their successors. Mynniscus used to call 
<A NAME="389"></A>Callippides 'ape' on account of the extravagance of his action, and the 
<A NAME="390"></A>same view was held of Pindarus. Tragic art, then, as a whole, stands to 
<A NAME="391"></A>Epic in the same relation as the younger to the elder actors. So we are 
<A NAME="392"></A>told that Epic poetry is addressed to a cultivated audience, who do not 
<A NAME="393"></A>need gesture; Tragedy, to an inferior public. Being then unrefined, it 
<A NAME="394"></A>is evidently the lower of the two.
<A NAME="395"></A><BR><BR>Now, in the first place, this censure attaches not to the poetic 
<A NAME="396"></A>but to the histrionic art; for gesticulation may be equally overdone in 
<A NAME="397"></A>epic recitation, as by Sosistratus, or in lyrical competition, as by Mnasitheus 
<A NAME="398"></A>the Opuntian. Next, all action is not to be condemned- any more than all 
<A NAME="399"></A>dancing- but only that of bad performers. Such was the fault found in Callippides, 
<A NAME="400"></A>as also in others of our own day, who are censured for representing degraded 
<A NAME="401"></A>women. Again, Tragedy like Epic poetry produces its effect even without 
<A NAME="402"></A>action; it reveals its power by mere reading. If, then, in all other respects 
<A NAME="403"></A>it is superior, this fault, we say, is not inherent in 
<A NAME="404"></A>it.
<A NAME="405"></A><BR><BR>And superior it is, because it has an the epic elements- it may 
<A NAME="406"></A>even use the epic meter- with the music and spectacular effects as important 
<A NAME="407"></A>accessories; and these produce the most vivid of pleasures. Further, it 
<A NAME="408"></A>has vividness of impression in reading as well as in representation. Moreover, 
<A NAME="409"></A>the art attains its end within narrower limits for the concentrated effect 
<A NAME="410"></A>is more pleasurable than one which is spread over a long time and so diluted. 
<A NAME="411"></A>What, for example, would be the effect of the Oedipus of Sophocles, if 
<A NAME="412"></A>it were cast into a form as long as the Iliad? Once more, the Epic imitation 
<A NAME="413"></A>has less unity; as is shown by this, that any Epic poem will furnish subjects 
<A NAME="414"></A>for several tragedies. Thus if the story adopted by the poet has a strict 
<A NAME="415"></A>unity, it must either be concisely told and appear truncated; or, if it 
<A NAME="416"></A>conforms to the Epic canon of length, it must seem weak and watery. [Such 
<A NAME="417"></A>length implies some loss of unity,] if, I mean, the poem is constructed 
<A NAME="418"></A>out of several actions, like the Iliad and the Odyssey, which have many 
<A NAME="419"></A>such parts, each with a certain magnitude of its own. Yet these poems are 
<A NAME="420"></A>as perfect as possible in structure; each is, in the highest degree attainable, 
<A NAME="421"></A>an imitation of a single action.
<A NAME="422"></A><BR><BR>If, then, tragedy is superior to epic poetry in all these respects, 
<A NAME="423"></A>and, moreover, fulfills its specific function better as an art- for each 
<A NAME="424"></A>art ought to produce, not any chance pleasure, but the pleasure proper 
<A NAME="425"></A>to it, as already stated- it plainly follows that tragedy is the higher 
<A NAME="426"></A>art, as attaining its end more perfectly.
<A NAME="427"></A><BR><BR>Thus much may suffice concerning Tragic and Epic poetry in general; 
<A NAME="428"></A>their several kinds and parts, with the number of each and their differences; 
<A NAME="429"></A>the causes that make a poem good or bad; the objections of the critics 
<A NAME="430"></A>and the answers to these objections....
