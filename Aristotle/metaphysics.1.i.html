<A NAME="10"></A><B>Part 1</B>
<A NAME="11"></A><BR><BR><BR><BR>"ALL men by nature desire to know. An indication of this 
<A NAME="12"></A>is the delight we take in our senses; for even apart from their usefulness 
<A NAME="13"></A>they are loved for themselves; and above all others the sense of sight. 
<A NAME="14"></A>For not only with a view to action, but even when we are not going to do 
<A NAME="15"></A>anything, we prefer seeing (one might say) to everything else. The reason 
<A NAME="16"></A>is that this, most of all the senses, makes us know and brings to light 
<A NAME="17"></A>many differences between things. <BR><BR>"By nature animals are born with 
<A NAME="18"></A>the faculty of sensation, and from sensation memory is produced in some 
<A NAME="19"></A>of them, though not in others. And therefore the former are more intelligent 
<A NAME="20"></A>and apt at learning than those which cannot remember; those which are incapable 
<A NAME="21"></A>of hearing sounds are intelligent though they cannot be taught, e.g. the 
<A NAME="22"></A>bee, and any other race of animals that may be like it; and those which 
<A NAME="23"></A>besides memory have this sense of hearing can be taught. <BR><BR>"The animals 
<A NAME="24"></A>other than man live by appearances and memories, and have but little of 
<A NAME="25"></A>connected experience; but the human race lives also by art and reasonings. 
<A NAME="26"></A>Now from memory experience is produced in men; for the several memories 
<A NAME="27"></A>of the same thing produce finally the capacity for a single experience. 
<A NAME="28"></A>And experience seems pretty much like science and art, but really science 
<A NAME="29"></A>and art come to men through experience; for 'experience made art', as Polus 
<A NAME="30"></A>says, 'but inexperience luck.' Now art arises when from many notions gained 
<A NAME="31"></A>by experience one universal judgement about a class of objects is produced. 
<A NAME="32"></A>For to have a judgement that when Callias was ill of this disease this 
<A NAME="33"></A>did him good, and similarly in the case of Socrates and in many individual 
<A NAME="34"></A>cases, is a matter of experience; but to judge that it has done good to 
<A NAME="35"></A>all persons of a certain constitution, marked off in one class, when they 
<A NAME="36"></A>were ill of this disease, e.g. to phlegmatic or bilious people when burning 
<A NAME="37"></A>with fevers-this is a matter of art. <BR><BR>"With a view to action experience 
<A NAME="38"></A>seems in no respect inferior to art, and men of experience succeed even 
<A NAME="39"></A>better than those who have theory without experience. (The reason is that 
<A NAME="40"></A>experience is knowledge of individuals, art of universals, and actions 
<A NAME="41"></A>and productions are all concerned with the individual; for the physician 
<A NAME="42"></A>does not cure man, except in an incidental way, but Callias or Socrates 
<A NAME="43"></A>or some other called by some such individual name, who happens to be a 
<A NAME="44"></A>man. If, then, a man has the theory without the experience, and recognizes 
<A NAME="45"></A>the universal but does not know the individual included in this, he will 
<A NAME="46"></A>often fail to cure; for it is the individual that is to be cured.) But 
<A NAME="47"></A>yet we think that knowledge and understanding belong to art rather than 
<A NAME="48"></A>to experience, and we suppose artists to be wiser than men of experience 
<A NAME="49"></A>(which implies that Wisdom depends in all cases rather on knowledge); and 
<A NAME="50"></A>this because the former know the cause, but the latter do not. For men 
<A NAME="51"></A>of experience know that the thing is so, but do not know why, while the 
<A NAME="52"></A>others know the 'why' and the cause. Hence we think also that the masterworkers 
<A NAME="53"></A>in each craft are more honourable and know in a truer sense and are wiser 
<A NAME="54"></A>than the manual workers, because they know the causes of the things that 
<A NAME="55"></A>are done (we think the manual workers are like certain lifeless things 
<A NAME="56"></A>which act indeed, but act without knowing what they do, as fire burns,-but 
<A NAME="57"></A>while the lifeless things perform each of their functions by a natural 
<A NAME="58"></A>tendency, the labourers perform them through habit); thus we view them 
<A NAME="59"></A>as being wiser not in virtue of being able to act, but of having the theory 
<A NAME="60"></A>for themselves and knowing the causes. And in general it is a sign of the 
<A NAME="61"></A>man who knows and of the man who does not know, that the former can teach, 
<A NAME="62"></A>and therefore we think art more truly knowledge than experience is; for 
<A NAME="63"></A>artists can teach, and men of mere experience cannot. <BR><BR>"Again, we 
<A NAME="64"></A>do not regard any of the senses as Wisdom; yet surely these give the most 
<A NAME="65"></A>authoritative knowledge of particulars. But they do not tell us the 'why' 
<A NAME="66"></A>of anything-e.g. why fire is hot; they only say that it is hot. <BR><BR>"At 
<A NAME="67"></A>first he who invented any art whatever that went beyond the common perceptions 
<A NAME="68"></A>of man was naturally admired by men, not only because there was something 
<A NAME="69"></A>useful in the inventions, but because he was thought wise and superior 
<A NAME="70"></A>to the rest. But as more arts were invented, and some were directed to 
<A NAME="71"></A>the necessities of life, others to recreation, the inventors of the latter 
<A NAME="72"></A>were naturally always regarded as wiser than the inventors of the former, 
<A NAME="73"></A>because their branches of knowledge did not aim at utility. Hence when 
<A NAME="74"></A>all such inventions were already established, the sciences which do not 
<A NAME="75"></A>aim at giving pleasure or at the necessities of life were discovered, and 
<A NAME="76"></A>first in the places where men first began to have leisure. This is why 
<A NAME="77"></A>the mathematical arts were founded in Egypt; for there the priestly caste 
<A NAME="78"></A>was allowed to be at leisure. <BR><BR>"We have said in the Ethics what 
<A NAME="79"></A>the difference is between art and science and the other kindred faculties; 
<A NAME="80"></A>but the point of our present discussion is this, that all men suppose what 
<A NAME="81"></A>is called Wisdom to deal with the first causes and the principles of things; 
<A NAME="82"></A>so that, as has been said before, the man of experience is thought to be 
<A NAME="83"></A>wiser than the possessors of any sense-perception whatever, the artist 
<A NAME="84"></A>wiser than the men of experience, the masterworker than the mechanic, and 
<A NAME="85"></A>the theoretical kinds of knowledge to be more of the nature of Wisdom than 
<A NAME="86"></A>the productive. Clearly then Wisdom is knowledge about certain principles 
<A NAME="87"></A>and causes.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="88"></A><B>Part 2</B>
<A NAME="89"></A>"<BR><BR>
<A NAME="90"></A><BR><BR>"Since we are seeking this knowledge, we must inquire of what kind 
<A NAME="91"></A>are the causes and the principles, the knowledge of which is Wisdom. If 
<A NAME="92"></A>one were to take the notions we have about the wise man, this might perhaps 
<A NAME="93"></A>make the answer more evident. We suppose first, then, that the wise man 
<A NAME="94"></A>knows all things, as far as possible, although he has not knowledge of 
<A NAME="95"></A>each of them in detail; secondly, that he who can learn things that are 
<A NAME="96"></A>difficult, and not easy for man to know, is wise (sense-perception is common 
<A NAME="97"></A>to all, and therefore easy and no mark of Wisdom); again, that he who is 
<A NAME="98"></A>more exact and more capable of teaching the causes is wiser, in every branch 
<A NAME="99"></A>of knowledge; and that of the sciences, also, that which is desirable on 
<A NAME="100"></A>its own account and for the sake of knowing it is more of the nature of 
<A NAME="101"></A>Wisdom than that which is desirable on account of its results, and the 
<A NAME="102"></A>superior science is more of the nature of Wisdom than the ancillary; for 
<A NAME="103"></A>the wise man must not be ordered but must order, and he must not obey another, 
<A NAME="104"></A>but the less wise must obey him. <BR><BR>"Such and so many are the notions, 
<A NAME="105"></A>then, which we have about Wisdom and the wise. Now of these characteristics 
<A NAME="106"></A>that of knowing all things must belong to him who has in the highest degree 
<A NAME="107"></A>universal knowledge; for he knows in a sense all the instances that fall 
<A NAME="108"></A>under the universal. And these things, the most universal, are on the whole 
<A NAME="109"></A>the hardest for men to know; for they are farthest from the senses. And 
<A NAME="110"></A>the most exact of the sciences are those which deal most with first principles; 
<A NAME="111"></A>for those which involve fewer principles are more exact than those which 
<A NAME="112"></A>involve additional principles, e.g. arithmetic than geometry. But the science 
<A NAME="113"></A>which investigates causes is also instructive, in a higher degree, for 
<A NAME="114"></A>the people who instruct us are those who tell the causes of each thing. 
<A NAME="115"></A>And understanding and knowledge pursued for their own sake are found most 
<A NAME="116"></A>in the knowledge of that which is most knowable (for he who chooses to 
<A NAME="117"></A>know for the sake of knowing will choose most readily that which is most 
<A NAME="118"></A>truly knowledge, and such is the knowledge of that which is most knowable); 
<A NAME="119"></A>and the first principles and the causes are most knowable; for by reason 
<A NAME="120"></A>of these, and from these, all other things come to be known, and not these 
<A NAME="121"></A>by means of the things subordinate to them. And the science which knows 
<A NAME="122"></A>to what end each thing must be done is the most authoritative of the sciences, 
<A NAME="123"></A>and more authoritative than any ancillary science; and this end is the 
<A NAME="124"></A>good of that thing, and in general the supreme good in the whole of nature. 
<A NAME="125"></A>Judged by all the tests we have mentioned, then, the name in question falls 
<A NAME="126"></A>to the same science; this must be a science that investigates the first 
<A NAME="127"></A>principles and causes; for the good, i.e. the end, is one of the causes. 
<A NAME="128"></A><BR><BR>"That it is not a science of production is clear even from the 
<A NAME="129"></A>history of the earliest philosophers. For it is owing to their wonder that 
<A NAME="130"></A>men both now begin and at first began to philosophize; they wondered originally 
<A NAME="131"></A>at the obvious difficulties, then advanced little by little and stated 
<A NAME="132"></A>difficulties about the greater matters, e.g. about the phenomena of the 
<A NAME="133"></A>moon and those of the sun and of the stars, and about the genesis of the 
<A NAME="134"></A>universe. And a man who is puzzled and wonders thinks himself ignorant 
<A NAME="135"></A>(whence even the lover of myth is in a sense a lover of Wisdom, for the 
<A NAME="136"></A>myth is composed of wonders); therefore since they philosophized order 
<A NAME="137"></A>to escape from ignorance, evidently they were pursuing science in order 
<A NAME="138"></A>to know, and not for any utilitarian end. And this is confirmed by the 
<A NAME="139"></A>facts; for it was when almost all the necessities of life and the things 
<A NAME="140"></A>that make for comfort and recreation had been secured, that such knowledge 
<A NAME="141"></A>began to be sought. Evidently then we do not seek it for the sake of any 
<A NAME="142"></A>other advantage; but as the man is free, we say, who exists for his own 
<A NAME="143"></A>sake and not for another's, so we pursue this as the only free science, 
<A NAME="144"></A>for it alone exists for its own sake. <BR><BR>"Hence also the possession 
<A NAME="145"></A>of it might be justly regarded as beyond human power; for in many ways 
<A NAME="146"></A>human nature is in bondage, so that according to Simonides 'God alone can 
<A NAME="147"></A>have this privilege', and it is unfitting that man should not be content 
<A NAME="148"></A>to seek the knowledge that is suited to him. If, then, there is something 
<A NAME="149"></A>in what the poets say, and jealousy is natural to the divine power, it 
<A NAME="150"></A>would probably occur in this case above all, and all who excelled in this 
<A NAME="151"></A>knowledge would be unfortunate. But the divine power cannot be jealous 
<A NAME="152"></A>(nay, according to the proverb, 'bards tell a lie'), nor should any other 
<A NAME="153"></A>science be thought more honourable than one of this sort. For the most 
<A NAME="154"></A>divine science is also most honourable; and this science alone must be, 
<A NAME="155"></A>in two ways, most divine. For the science which it would be most meet for 
<A NAME="156"></A>God to have is a divine science, and so is any science that deals with 
<A NAME="157"></A>divine objects; and this science alone has both these qualities; for (1) 
<A NAME="158"></A>God is thought to be among the causes of all things and to be a first principle, 
<A NAME="159"></A>and (2) such a science either God alone can have, or God above all others. 
<A NAME="160"></A>All the sciences, indeed, are more necessary than this, but none is better. 
<A NAME="161"></A><BR><BR>"Yet the acquisition of it must in a sense end in something which 
<A NAME="162"></A>is the opposite of our original inquiries. For all men begin, as we said, 
<A NAME="163"></A>by wondering that things are as they are, as they do about self-moving 
<A NAME="164"></A>marionettes, or about the solstices or the incommensurability of the diagonal 
<A NAME="165"></A>of a square with the side; for it seems wonderful to all who have not yet 
<A NAME="166"></A>seen the reason, that there is a thing which cannot be measured even by 
<A NAME="167"></A>the smallest unit. But we must end in the contrary and, according to the 
<A NAME="168"></A>proverb, the better state, as is the case in these instances too when men 
<A NAME="169"></A>learn the cause; for there is nothing which would surprise a geometer so 
<A NAME="170"></A>much as if the diagonal turned out to be commensurable. <BR><BR>"We have 
<A NAME="171"></A>stated, then, what is the nature of the science we are searching for, and 
<A NAME="172"></A>what is the mark which our search and our whole investigation must 
<A NAME="173"></A>reach.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="174"></A><B>Part 3</B>
<A NAME="175"></A>"<BR><BR>
<A NAME="176"></A><BR><BR>"Evidently we have to acquire knowledge of the original causes 
<A NAME="177"></A>(for we say we know each thing only when we think we recognize its first 
<A NAME="178"></A>cause), and causes are spoken of in four senses. In one of these we mean 
<A NAME="179"></A>the substance, i.e. the essence (for the 'why' is reducible finally to 
<A NAME="180"></A>the definition, and the ultimate 'why' is a cause and principle); in another 
<A NAME="181"></A>the matter or substratum, in a third the source of the change, and in a 
<A NAME="182"></A>fourth the cause opposed to this, the purpose and the good (for this is 
<A NAME="183"></A>the end of all generation and change). We have studied these causes sufficiently 
<A NAME="184"></A>in our work on nature, but yet let us call to our aid those who have attacked 
<A NAME="185"></A>the investigation of being and philosophized about reality before us. For 
<A NAME="186"></A>obviously they too speak of certain principles and causes; to go over their 
<A NAME="187"></A>views, then, will be of profit to the present inquiry, for we shall either 
<A NAME="188"></A>find another kind of cause, or be more convinced of the correctness of 
<A NAME="189"></A>those which we now maintain. <BR><BR>"Of the first philosophers, then, 
<A NAME="190"></A>most thought the principles which were of the nature of matter were the 
<A NAME="191"></A>only principles of all things. That of which all things that are consist, 
<A NAME="192"></A>the first from which they come to be, the last into which they are resolved 
<A NAME="193"></A>(the substance remaining, but changing in its modifications), this they 
<A NAME="194"></A>say is the element and this the principle of things, and therefore they 
<A NAME="195"></A>think nothing is either generated or destroyed, since this sort of entity 
<A NAME="196"></A>is always conserved, as we say Socrates neither comes to be absolutely 
<A NAME="197"></A>when he comes to be beautiful or musical, nor ceases to be when loses these 
<A NAME="198"></A>characteristics, because the substratum, Socrates himself remains. just 
<A NAME="199"></A>so they say nothing else comes to be or ceases to be; for there must be 
<A NAME="200"></A>some entity-either one or more than one-from which all other things come 
<A NAME="201"></A>to be, it being conserved. <BR><BR>"Yet they do not all agree as to the 
<A NAME="202"></A>number and the nature of these principles. Thales, the founder of this 
<A NAME="203"></A>type of philosophy, says the principle is water (for which reason he declared 
<A NAME="204"></A>that the earth rests on water), getting the notion perhaps from seeing 
<A NAME="205"></A>that the nutriment of all things is moist, and that heat itself is generated 
<A NAME="206"></A>from the moist and kept alive by it (and that from which they come to be 
<A NAME="207"></A>is a principle of all things). He got his notion from this fact, and from 
<A NAME="208"></A>the fact that the seeds of all things have a moist nature, and that water 
<A NAME="209"></A>is the origin of the nature of moist things. <BR><BR>"Some think that even 
<A NAME="210"></A>the ancients who lived long before the present generation, and first framed 
<A NAME="211"></A>accounts of the gods, had a similar view of nature; for they made Ocean 
<A NAME="212"></A>and Tethys the parents of creation, and described the oath of the gods 
<A NAME="213"></A>as being by water, to which they give the name of Styx; for what is oldest 
<A NAME="214"></A>is most honourable, and the most honourable thing is that by which one 
<A NAME="215"></A>swears. It may perhaps be uncertain whether this opinion about nature is 
<A NAME="216"></A>primitive and ancient, but Thales at any rate is said to have declared 
<A NAME="217"></A>himself thus about the first cause. Hippo no one would think fit to include 
<A NAME="218"></A>among these thinkers, because of the paltriness of his thought. <BR><BR>"Anaximenes 
<A NAME="219"></A>and Diogenes make air prior to water, and the most primary of the simple 
<A NAME="220"></A>bodies, while Hippasus of Metapontium and Heraclitus of Ephesus say this 
<A NAME="221"></A>of fire, and Empedocles says it of the four elements (adding a fourth-earth-to 
<A NAME="222"></A>those which have been named); for these, he says, always remain and do 
<A NAME="223"></A>not come to be, except that they come to be more or fewer, being aggregated 
<A NAME="224"></A>into one and segregated out of one. <BR><BR>"Anaxagoras of Clazomenae, 
<A NAME="225"></A>who, though older than Empedocles, was later in his philosophical activity, 
<A NAME="226"></A>says the principles are infinite in number; for he says almost all the 
<A NAME="227"></A>things that are made of parts like themselves, in the manner of water or 
<A NAME="228"></A>fire, are generated and destroyed in this way, only by aggregation and 
<A NAME="229"></A>segregation, and are not in any other sense generated or destroyed, but 
<A NAME="230"></A>remain eternally. <BR><BR>"From these facts one might think that the only 
<A NAME="231"></A>cause is the so-called material cause; but as men thus advanced, the very 
<A NAME="232"></A>facts opened the way for them and joined in forcing them to investigate 
<A NAME="233"></A>the subject. However true it may be that all generation and destruction 
<A NAME="234"></A>proceed from some one or (for that matter) from more elements, why does 
<A NAME="235"></A>this happen and what is the cause? For at least the substratum itself does 
<A NAME="236"></A>not make itself change; e.g. neither the wood nor the bronze causes the 
<A NAME="237"></A>change of either of them, nor does the wood manufacture a bed and the bronze 
<A NAME="238"></A>a statue, but something else is the cause of the change. And to seek this 
<A NAME="239"></A>is to seek the second cause, as we should say,-that from which comes the 
<A NAME="240"></A>beginning of the movement. Now those who at the very beginning set themselves 
<A NAME="241"></A>to this kind of inquiry, and said the substratum was one, were not at all 
<A NAME="242"></A>dissatisfied with themselves; but some at least of those who maintain it 
<A NAME="243"></A>to be one-as though defeated by this search for the second cause-say the 
<A NAME="244"></A>one and nature as a whole is unchangeable not only in respect of generation 
<A NAME="245"></A>and destruction (for this is a primitive belief, and all agreed in it), 
<A NAME="246"></A>but also of all other change; and this view is peculiar to them. Of those 
<A NAME="247"></A>who said the universe was one, then none succeeded in discovering a cause 
<A NAME="248"></A>of this sort, except perhaps Parmenides, and he only inasmuch as he supposes 
<A NAME="249"></A>that there is not only one but also in some sense two causes. But for those 
<A NAME="250"></A>who make more elements it is more possible to state the second cause, e.g. 
<A NAME="251"></A>for those who make hot and cold, or fire and earth, the elements; for they 
<A NAME="252"></A>treat fire as having a nature which fits it to move things, and water and 
<A NAME="253"></A>earth and such things they treat in the contrary way. <BR><BR>"When these 
<A NAME="254"></A>men and the principles of this kind had had their day, as the latter were 
<A NAME="255"></A>found inadequate to generate the nature of things men were again forced 
<A NAME="256"></A>by the truth itself, as we said, to inquire into the next kind of cause. 
<A NAME="257"></A>For it is not likely either that fire or earth or any such element should 
<A NAME="258"></A>be the reason why things manifest goodness and, beauty both in their being 
<A NAME="259"></A>and in their coming to be, or that those thinkers should have supposed 
<A NAME="260"></A>it was; nor again could it be right to entrust so great a matter to spontaneity 
<A NAME="261"></A>and chance. When one man said, then, that reason was present-as in animals, 
<A NAME="262"></A>so throughout nature-as the cause of order and of all arrangement, he seemed 
<A NAME="263"></A>like a sober man in contrast with the random talk of his predecessors. 
<A NAME="264"></A>We know that Anaxagoras certainly adopted these views, but Hermotimus of 
<A NAME="265"></A>Clazomenae is credited with expressing them earlier. Those who thought 
<A NAME="266"></A>thus stated that there is a principle of things which is at the same time 
<A NAME="267"></A>the cause of beauty, and that sort of cause from which things acquire 
<A NAME="268"></A>movement.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="269"></A><B>Part 4</B>
<A NAME="270"></A>"<BR><BR>
<A NAME="271"></A><BR><BR>"One might suspect that Hesiod was the first to look for such a 
<A NAME="272"></A>thing-or some one else who put love or desire among existing things as 
<A NAME="273"></A>a principle, as Parmenides, too, does; for he, in constructing the genesis 
<A NAME="274"></A>of the universe, says:- "<BR><BR>
<A NAME="275"></A><BR><BR>"Love first of all the Gods she planned. "<BR><BR>
<A NAME="276"></A><BR><BR>"And Hesiod says:- "<BR><BR>
<A NAME="277"></A><BR><BR>"First of all things was chaos made, and then <BR><BR>"Broad-breasted 
<A NAME="278"></A>earth... <BR><BR>"And love, 'mid all the gods pre-eminent, 
<A NAME="279"></A>"<BR><BR>

<A NAME="280"></A><BR><BR>which implies that among existing things there must be from the 
<A NAME="281"></A>first a cause which will move things and bring them together. How these 
<A NAME="282"></A>thinkers should be arranged with regard to priority of discovery let us 
<A NAME="283"></A>be allowed to decide later; but since the contraries of the various forms 
<A NAME="284"></A>of good were also perceived to be present in nature-not only order and 
<A NAME="285"></A>the beautiful, but also disorder and the ugly, and bad things in greater 
<A NAME="286"></A>number than good, and ignoble things than beautiful-therefore another thinker 
<A NAME="287"></A>introduced friendship and strife, each of the two the cause of one of these 
<A NAME="288"></A>two sets of qualities. For if we were to follow out the view of Empedocles, 
<A NAME="289"></A>and interpret it according to its meaning and not to its lisping expression, 
<A NAME="290"></A>we should find that friendship is the cause of good things, and strife 
<A NAME="291"></A>of bad. Therefore, if we said that Empedocles in a sense both mentions, 
<A NAME="292"></A>and is the first to mention, the bad and the good as principles, we should 
<A NAME="293"></A>perhaps be right, since the cause of all goods is the good itself. <BR><BR>"These 
<A NAME="294"></A>thinkers, as we say, evidently grasped, and to this extent, two of the 
<A NAME="295"></A>causes which we distinguished in our work on nature-the matter and the 
<A NAME="296"></A>source of the movement-vaguely, however, and with no clearness, but as 
<A NAME="297"></A>untrained men behave in fights; for they go round their opponents and often 
<A NAME="298"></A>strike fine blows, but they do not fight on scientific principles, and 
<A NAME="299"></A>so too these thinkers do not seem to know what they say; for it is evident 
<A NAME="300"></A>that, as a rule, they make no use of their causes except to a small extent. 
<A NAME="301"></A>For Anaxagoras uses reason as a deus ex machina for the making of the world, 
<A NAME="302"></A>and when he is at a loss to tell from what cause something necessarily 
<A NAME="303"></A>is, then he drags reason in, but in all other cases ascribes events to 
<A NAME="304"></A>anything rather than to reason. And Empedocles, though he uses the causes 
<A NAME="305"></A>to a greater extent than this, neither does so sufficiently nor attains 
<A NAME="306"></A>consistency in their use. At least, in many cases he makes love segregate 
<A NAME="307"></A>things, and strife aggregate them. For whenever the universe is dissolved 
<A NAME="308"></A>into its elements by strife, fire is aggregated into one, and so is each 
<A NAME="309"></A>of the other elements; but whenever again under the influence of love they 
<A NAME="310"></A>come together into one, the parts must again be segregated out of each 
<A NAME="311"></A>element. <BR><BR>"Empedocles, then, in contrast with his precessors, was 
<A NAME="312"></A>the first to introduce the dividing of this cause, not positing one source 
<A NAME="313"></A>of movement, but different and contrary sources. Again, he was the first 
<A NAME="314"></A>to speak of four material elements; yet he does not use four, but treats 
<A NAME="315"></A>them as two only; he treats fire by itself, and its opposite-earth, air, 
<A NAME="316"></A>and water-as one kind of thing. We may learn this by study of his verses. 
<A NAME="317"></A><BR><BR>"This philosopher then, as we say, has spoken of the principles 
<A NAME="318"></A>in this way, and made them of this number. Leucippus and his associate 
<A NAME="319"></A>Democritus say that the full and the empty are the elements, calling the 
<A NAME="320"></A>one being and the other non-being-the full and solid being being, the empty 
<A NAME="321"></A>non-being (whence they say being no more is than non-being, because the 
<A NAME="322"></A>solid no more is than the empty); and they make these the material causes 
<A NAME="323"></A>of things. And as those who make the underlying substance one generate 
<A NAME="324"></A>all other things by its modifications, supposing the rare and the dense 
<A NAME="325"></A>to be the sources of the modifications, in the same way these philosophers 
<A NAME="326"></A>say the differences in the elements are the causes of all other qualities. 
<A NAME="327"></A>These differences, they say, are three-shape and order and position. For 
<A NAME="328"></A>they say the real is differentiated only by 'rhythm and 'inter-contact' 
<A NAME="329"></A>and 'turning'; and of these rhythm is shape, inter-contact is order, and 
<A NAME="330"></A>turning is position; for A differs from N in shape, AN from NA in order, 
<A NAME="331"></A>M from W in position. The question of movement-whence or how it is to belong 
<A NAME="332"></A>to things-these thinkers, like the others, lazily neglected. <BR><BR>"Regarding 
<A NAME="333"></A>the two causes, then, as we say, the inquiry seems to have been pushed 
<A NAME="334"></A>thus far by the early philosophers.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="335"></A><B>Part 5</B>
<A NAME="336"></A>"<BR><BR>
<A NAME="337"></A><BR><BR>"Contemporaneously with these philosophers and before them, the 
<A NAME="338"></A>so-called Pythagoreans, who were the first to take up mathematics, not 
<A NAME="339"></A>only advanced this study, but also having been brought up in it they thought 
<A NAME="340"></A>its principles were the principles of all things. Since of these principles 
<A NAME="341"></A>numbers are by nature the first, and in numbers they seemed to see many 
<A NAME="342"></A>resemblances to the things that exist and come into being-more than in 
<A NAME="343"></A>fire and earth and water (such and such a modification of numbers being 
<A NAME="344"></A>justice, another being soul and reason, another being opportunity-and similarly 
<A NAME="345"></A>almost all other things being numerically expressible); since, again, they 
<A NAME="346"></A>saw that the modifications and the ratios of the musical scales were expressible 
<A NAME="347"></A>in numbers;-since, then, all other things seemed in their whole nature 
<A NAME="348"></A>to be modelled on numbers, and numbers seemed to be the first things in 
<A NAME="349"></A>the whole of nature, they supposed the elements of numbers to be the elements 
<A NAME="350"></A>of all things, and the whole heaven to be a musical scale and a number. 
<A NAME="351"></A>And all the properties of numbers and scales which they could show to agree 
<A NAME="352"></A>with the attributes and parts and the whole arrangement of the heavens, 
<A NAME="353"></A>they collected and fitted into their scheme; and if there was a gap anywhere, 
<A NAME="354"></A>they readily made additions so as to make their whole theory coherent. 
<A NAME="355"></A>E.g. as the number 10 is thought to be perfect and to comprise the whole 
<A NAME="356"></A>nature of numbers, they say that the bodies which move through the heavens 
<A NAME="357"></A>are ten, but as the visible bodies are only nine, to meet this they invent 
<A NAME="358"></A>a tenth--the 'counter-earth'. We have discussed these matters more exactly 
<A NAME="359"></A>elsewhere. <BR><BR>"But the object of our review is that we may learn from 
<A NAME="360"></A>these philosophers also what they suppose to be the principles and how 
<A NAME="361"></A>these fall under the causes we have named. Evidently, then, these thinkers 
<A NAME="362"></A>also consider that number is the principle both as matter for things and 
<A NAME="363"></A>as forming both their modifications and their permanent states, and hold 
<A NAME="364"></A>that the elements of number are the even and the odd, and that of these 
<A NAME="365"></A>the latter is limited, and the former unlimited; and that the One proceeds 
<A NAME="366"></A>from both of these (for it is both even and odd), and number from the One; 
<A NAME="367"></A>and that the whole heaven, as has been said, is numbers. <BR><BR>"Other 
<A NAME="368"></A>members of this same school say there are ten principles, which they arrange 
<A NAME="369"></A>in two columns of cognates-limit and unlimited, odd and even, one and plurality, 
<A NAME="370"></A>right and left, male and female, resting and moving, straight and curved, 
<A NAME="371"></A>light and darkness, good and bad, square and oblong. In this way Alcmaeon 
<A NAME="372"></A>of Croton seems also to have conceived the matter, and either he got this 
<A NAME="373"></A>view from them or they got it from him; for he expressed himself similarly 
<A NAME="374"></A>to them. For he says most human affairs go in pairs, meaning not definite 
<A NAME="375"></A>contrarieties such as the Pythagoreans speak of, but any chance contrarieties, 
<A NAME="376"></A>e.g. white and black, sweet and bitter, good and bad, great and small. 
<A NAME="377"></A>He threw out indefinite suggestions about the other contrarieties, but 
<A NAME="378"></A>the Pythagoreans declared both how many and which their contraricties are. 
<A NAME="379"></A><BR><BR>"From both these schools, then, we can learn this much, that the 
<A NAME="380"></A>contraries are the principles of things; and how many these principles 
<A NAME="381"></A>are and which they are, we can learn from one of the two schools. But how 
<A NAME="382"></A>these principles can be brought together under the causes we have named 
<A NAME="383"></A>has not been clearly and articulately stated by them; they seem, however, 
<A NAME="384"></A>to range the elements under the head of matter; for out of these as immanent 
<A NAME="385"></A>parts they say substance is composed and moulded. <BR><BR>"From these facts 
<A NAME="386"></A>we may sufficiently perceive the meaning of the ancients who said the elements 
<A NAME="387"></A>of nature were more than one; but there are some who spoke of the universe 
<A NAME="388"></A>as if it were one entity, though they were not all alike either in the 
<A NAME="389"></A>excellence of their statement or in its conformity to the facts of nature. 
<A NAME="390"></A>The discussion of them is in no way appropriate to our present investigation 
<A NAME="391"></A>of causes, for. they do not, like some of the natural philosophers, assume 
<A NAME="392"></A>being to be one and yet generate it out of the one as out of matter, but 
<A NAME="393"></A>they speak in another way; those others add change, since they generate 
<A NAME="394"></A>the universe, but these thinkers say the universe is unchangeable. Yet 
<A NAME="395"></A>this much is germane to the present inquiry: Parmenides seems to fasten 
<A NAME="396"></A>on that which is one in definition, Melissus on that which is one in matter, 
<A NAME="397"></A>for which reason the former says that it is limited, the latter that it 
<A NAME="398"></A>is unlimited; while Xenophanes, the first of these partisans of the One 
<A NAME="399"></A>(for Parmenides is said to have been his pupil), gave no clear statement, 
<A NAME="400"></A>nor does he seem to have grasped the nature of either of these causes, 
<A NAME="401"></A>but with reference to the whole material universe he says the One is God. 
<A NAME="402"></A>Now these thinkers, as we said, must be neglected for the purposes of the 
<A NAME="403"></A>present inquiry-two of them entirely, as being a little too naive, viz. 
<A NAME="404"></A>Xenophanes and Melissus; but Parmenides seems in places to speak with more 
<A NAME="405"></A>insight. For, claiming that, besides the existent, nothing non-existent 
<A NAME="406"></A>exists, he thinks that of necessity one thing exists, viz. the existent 
<A NAME="407"></A>and nothing else (on this we have spoken more clearly in our work on nature), 
<A NAME="408"></A>but being forced to follow the observed facts, and supposing the existence 
<A NAME="409"></A>of that which is one in definition, but more than one according to our 
<A NAME="410"></A>sensations, he now posits two causes and two principles, calling them hot 
<A NAME="411"></A>and cold, i.e. fire and earth; and of these he ranges the hot with the 
<A NAME="412"></A>existent, and the other with the non-existent. <BR><BR>"From what has been 
<A NAME="413"></A>said, then, and from the wise men who have now sat in council with us, 
<A NAME="414"></A>we have got thus much-on the one hand from the earliest philosophers, who 
<A NAME="415"></A>regard the first principle as corporeal (for water and fire and such things 
<A NAME="416"></A>are bodies), and of whom some suppose that there is one corporeal principle, 
<A NAME="417"></A>others that there are more than one, but both put these under the head 
<A NAME="418"></A>of matter; and on the other hand from some who posit both this cause and 
<A NAME="419"></A>besides this the source of movement, which we have got from some as single 
<A NAME="420"></A>and from others as twofold. <BR><BR>"Down to the Italian school, then, 
<A NAME="421"></A>and apart from it, philosophers have treated these subjects rather obscurely, 
<A NAME="422"></A>except that, as we said, they have in fact used two kinds of cause, and 
<A NAME="423"></A>one of these-the source of movement-some treat as one and others as two. 
<A NAME="424"></A>But the Pythagoreans have said in the same way that there are two principles, 
<A NAME="425"></A>but added this much, which is peculiar to them, that they thought that 
<A NAME="426"></A>finitude and infinity were not attributes of certain other things, e.g. 
<A NAME="427"></A>of fire or earth or anything else of this kind, but that infinity itself 
<A NAME="428"></A>and unity itself were the substance of the things of which they are predicated. 
<A NAME="429"></A>This is why number was the substance of all things. On this subject, then, 
<A NAME="430"></A>they expressed themselves thus; and regarding the question of essence they 
<A NAME="431"></A>began to make statements and definitions, but treated the matter too simply. 
<A NAME="432"></A>For they both defined superficially and thought that the first subject 
<A NAME="433"></A>of which a given definition was predicable was the substance of the thing 
<A NAME="434"></A>defined, as if one supposed that 'double' and '2' were the same, because 
<A NAME="435"></A>2 is the first thing of which 'double' is predicable. But surely to be 
<A NAME="436"></A>double and to be 2 are not the same; if they are, one thing will be many-a 
<A NAME="437"></A>consequence which they actually drew. From the earlier philosophers, then, 
<A NAME="438"></A>and from their successors we can learn thus much.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="439"></A><B>Part 6</B>
<A NAME="440"></A>"<BR><BR>
<A NAME="441"></A><BR><BR>"After the systems we have named came the philosophy of Plato, 
<A NAME="442"></A>which in most respects followed these thinkers, but had pecullarities that 
<A NAME="443"></A>distinguished it from the philosophy of the Italians. For, having in his 
<A NAME="444"></A>youth first become familiar with Cratylus and with the Heraclitean doctrines 
<A NAME="445"></A>(that all sensible things are ever in a state of flux and there is no knowledge 
<A NAME="446"></A>about them), these views he held even in later years. Socrates, however, 
<A NAME="447"></A>was busying himself about ethical matters and neglecting the world of nature 
<A NAME="448"></A>as a whole but seeking the universal in these ethical matters, and fixed 
<A NAME="449"></A>thought for the first time on definitions; Plato accepted his teaching, 
<A NAME="450"></A>but held that the problem applied not to sensible things but to entities 
<A NAME="451"></A>of another kind-for this reason, that the common definition could not be 
<A NAME="452"></A>a definition of any sensible thing, as they were always changing. Things 
<A NAME="453"></A>of this other sort, then, he called Ideas, and sensible things, he said, 
<A NAME="454"></A>were all named after these, and in virtue of a relation to these; for the 
<A NAME="455"></A>many existed by participation in the Ideas that have the same name as they. 
<A NAME="456"></A>Only the name 'participation' was new; for the Pythagoreans say that things 
<A NAME="457"></A>exist by 'imitation' of numbers, and Plato says they exist by participation, 
<A NAME="458"></A>changing the name. But what the participation or the imitation of the Forms 
<A NAME="459"></A>could be they left an open question. <BR><BR>"Further, besides sensible 
<A NAME="460"></A>things and Forms he says there are the objects of mathematics, which occupy 
<A NAME="461"></A>an intermediate position, differing from sensible things in being eternal 
<A NAME="462"></A>and unchangeable, from Forms in that there are many alike, while the Form 
<A NAME="463"></A>itself is in each case unique. <BR><BR>"Since the Forms were the causes 
<A NAME="464"></A>of all other things, he thought their elements were the elements of all 
<A NAME="465"></A>things. As matter, the great and the small were principles; as essential 
<A NAME="466"></A>reality, the One; for from the great and the small, by participation in 
<A NAME="467"></A>the One, come the Numbers. <BR><BR>"But he agreed with the Pythagoreans 
<A NAME="468"></A>in saying that the One is substance and not a predicate of something else; 
<A NAME="469"></A>and in saying that the Numbers are the causes of the reality of other things 
<A NAME="470"></A>he agreed with them; but positing a dyad and constructing the infinite 
<A NAME="471"></A>out of great and small, instead of treating the infinite as one, is peculiar 
<A NAME="472"></A>to him; and so is his view that the Numbers exist apart from sensible things, 
<A NAME="473"></A>while they say that the things themselves are Numbers, and do not place 
<A NAME="474"></A>the objects of mathematics between Forms and sensible things. His divergence 
<A NAME="475"></A>from the Pythagoreans in making the One and the Numbers separate from things, 
<A NAME="476"></A>and his introduction of the Forms, were due to his inquiries in the region 
<A NAME="477"></A>of definitions (for the earlier thinkers had no tincture of dialectic), 
<A NAME="478"></A>and his making the other entity besides the One a dyad was due to the belief 
<A NAME="479"></A>that the numbers, except those which were prime, could be neatly produced 
<A NAME="480"></A>out of the dyad as out of some plastic material. Yet what happens is the 
<A NAME="481"></A>contrary; the theory is not a reasonable one. For they make many things 
<A NAME="482"></A>out of the matter, and the form generates only once, but what we observe 
<A NAME="483"></A>is that one table is made from one matter, while the man who applies the 
<A NAME="484"></A>form, though he is one, makes many tables. And the relation of the male 
<A NAME="485"></A>to the female is similar; for the latter is impregnated by one copulation, 
<A NAME="486"></A>but the male impregnates many females; yet these are analogues of those 
<A NAME="487"></A>first principles. <BR><BR>"Plato, then, declared himself thus on the points 
<A NAME="488"></A>in question; it is evident from what has been said that he has used only 
<A NAME="489"></A>two causes, that of the essence and the material cause (for the Forms are 
<A NAME="490"></A>the causes of the essence of all other things, and the One is the cause 
<A NAME="491"></A>of the essence of the Forms); and it is evident what the underlying matter 
<A NAME="492"></A>is, of which the Forms are predicated in the case of sensible things, and 
<A NAME="493"></A>the One in the case of Forms, viz. that this is a dyad, the great and the 
<A NAME="494"></A>small. Further, he has assigned the cause of good and that of evil to the 
<A NAME="495"></A>elements, one to each of the two, as we say some of his predecessors sought 
<A NAME="496"></A>to do, e.g. Empedocles and Anaxagoras.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="497"></A><B>Part 7</B>
<A NAME="498"></A>"<BR><BR>
<A NAME="499"></A><BR><BR>"Our review of those who have spoken about first principles and 
<A NAME="500"></A>reality and of the way in which they have spoken, has been concise and 
<A NAME="501"></A>summary; but yet we have learnt this much from them, that of those who 
<A NAME="502"></A>speak about 'principle' and 'cause' no one has mentioned any principle 
<A NAME="503"></A>except those which have been distinguished in our work on nature, but all 
<A NAME="504"></A>evidently have some inkling of them, though only vaguely. For some speak 
<A NAME="505"></A>of the first principle as matter, whether they suppose one or more first 
<A NAME="506"></A>principles, and whether they suppose this to be a body or to be incorporeal; 
<A NAME="507"></A>e.g. Plato spoke of the great and the small, the Italians of the infinite, 
<A NAME="508"></A>Empedocles of fire, earth, water, and air, Anaxagoras of the infinity of 
<A NAME="509"></A>things composed of similar parts. These, then, have all had a notion of 
<A NAME="510"></A>this kind of cause, and so have all who speak of air or fire or water, 
<A NAME="511"></A>or something denser than fire and rarer than air; for some have said the 
<A NAME="512"></A>prime element is of this kind. <BR><BR>"These thinkers grasped this cause 
<A NAME="513"></A>only; but certain others have mentioned the source of movement, e.g. those 
<A NAME="514"></A>who make friendship and strife, or reason, or love, a principle. <BR><BR>"The 
<A NAME="515"></A>essence, i.e. the substantial reality, no one has expressed distinctly. 
<A NAME="516"></A>It is hinted at chiefly by those who believe in the Forms; for they do 
<A NAME="517"></A>not suppose either that the Forms are the matter of sensible things, and 
<A NAME="518"></A>the One the matter of the Forms, or that they are the source of movement 
<A NAME="519"></A>(for they say these are causes rather of immobility and of being at rest), 
<A NAME="520"></A>but they furnish the Forms as the essence of every other thing, and the 
<A NAME="521"></A>One as the essence of the Forms. <BR><BR>"That for whose sake actions and 
<A NAME="522"></A>changes and movements take place, they assert to be a cause in a way, but 
<A NAME="523"></A>not in this way, i.e. not in the way in which it is its nature to be a 
<A NAME="524"></A>cause. For those who speak of reason or friendship class these causes as 
<A NAME="525"></A>goods; they do not speak, however, as if anything that exists either existed 
<A NAME="526"></A>or came into being for the sake of these, but as if movements started from 
<A NAME="527"></A>these. In the same way those who say the One or the existent is the good, 
<A NAME="528"></A>say that it is the cause of substance, but not that substance either is 
<A NAME="529"></A>or comes to be for the sake of this. Therefore it turns out that in a sense 
<A NAME="530"></A>they both say and do not say the good is a cause; for they do not call 
<A NAME="531"></A>it a cause qua good but only incidentally. <BR><BR>"All these thinkers 
<A NAME="532"></A>then, as they cannot pitch on another cause, seem to testify that we have 
<A NAME="533"></A>determined rightly both how many and of what sort the causes are. Besides 
<A NAME="534"></A>this it is plain that when the causes are being looked for, either all 
<A NAME="535"></A>four must be sought thus or they must be sought in one of these four ways. 
<A NAME="536"></A>Let us next discuss the possible difficulties with regard to the way in 
<A NAME="537"></A>which each of these thinkers has spoken, and with regard to his situation 
<A NAME="538"></A>relatively to the first principles.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="539"></A><B>Part 8</B>
<A NAME="540"></A>"<BR><BR>
<A NAME="541"></A><BR><BR>"Those, then, who say the universe is one and posit one kind of 
<A NAME="542"></A>thing as matter, and as corporeal matter which has spatial magnitude, evidently 
<A NAME="543"></A>go astray in many ways. For they posit the elements of bodies only, not 
<A NAME="544"></A>of incorporeal things, though there are also incorporeal things. And in 
<A NAME="545"></A>trying to state the causes of generation and destruction, and in giving 
<A NAME="546"></A>a physical account of all things, they do away with the cause of movement. 
<A NAME="547"></A>Further, they err in not positing the substance, i.e. the essence, as the 
<A NAME="548"></A>cause of anything, and besides this in lightly calling any of the simple 
<A NAME="549"></A>bodies except earth the first principle, without inquiring how they are 
<A NAME="550"></A>produced out of one anothers-I mean fire, water, earth, and air. For some 
<A NAME="551"></A>things are produced out of each other by combination, others by separation, 
<A NAME="552"></A>and this makes the greatest difference to their priority and posteriority. 
<A NAME="553"></A>For (1) in a way the property of being most elementary of all would seem 
<A NAME="554"></A>to belong to the first thing from which they are produced by combination, 
<A NAME="555"></A>and this property would belong to the most fine-grained and subtle of bodies. 
<A NAME="556"></A>For this reason those who make fire the principle would be most in agreement 
<A NAME="557"></A>with this argument. But each of the other thinkers agrees that the element 
<A NAME="558"></A>of corporeal things is of this sort. At least none of those who named one 
<A NAME="559"></A>element claimed that earth was the element, evidently because of the coarseness 
<A NAME="560"></A>of its grain. (Of the other three elements each has found some judge on 
<A NAME="561"></A>its side; for some maintain that fire, others that water, others that air 
<A NAME="562"></A>is the element. Yet why, after all, do they not name earth also, as most 
<A NAME="563"></A>men do? For people say all things are earth Hesiod says earth was produced 
<A NAME="564"></A>first of corporeal things; so primitive and popular has the opinion been.) 
<A NAME="565"></A>According to this argument, then, no one would be right who either says 
<A NAME="566"></A>the first principle is any of the elements other than fire, or supposes 
<A NAME="567"></A>it to be denser than air but rarer than water. But (2) if that which is 
<A NAME="568"></A>later in generation is prior in nature, and that which is concocted and 
<A NAME="569"></A>compounded is later in generation, the contrary of what we have been saying 
<A NAME="570"></A>must be true,-water must be prior to air, and earth to water. <BR><BR>"So 
<A NAME="571"></A>much, then, for those who posit one cause such as we mentioned; but the 
<A NAME="572"></A>same is true if one supposes more of these, as Empedocles says matter of 
<A NAME="573"></A>things is four bodies. For he too is confronted by consequences some of 
<A NAME="574"></A>which are the same as have been mentioned, while others are peculiar to 
<A NAME="575"></A>him. For we see these bodies produced from one another, which implies that 
<A NAME="576"></A>the same body does not always remain fire or earth (we have spoken about 
<A NAME="577"></A>this in our works on nature); and regarding the cause of movement and the 
<A NAME="578"></A>question whether we must posit one or two, he must be thought to have spoken 
<A NAME="579"></A>neither correctly nor altogether plausibly. And in general, change of quality 
<A NAME="580"></A>is necessarily done away with for those who speak thus, for on their view 
<A NAME="581"></A>cold will not come from hot nor hot from cold. For if it did there would 
<A NAME="582"></A>be something that accepted the contraries themselves, and there would be 
<A NAME="583"></A>some one entity that became fire and water, which Empedocles denies. <BR><BR>"As 
<A NAME="584"></A>regards Anaxagoras, if one were to suppose that he said there were two 
<A NAME="585"></A>elements, the supposition would accord thoroughly with an argument which 
<A NAME="586"></A>Anaxagoras himself did not state articulately, but which he must have accepted 
<A NAME="587"></A>if any one had led him on to it. True, to say that in the beginning all 
<A NAME="588"></A>things were mixed is absurd both on other grounds and because it follows 
<A NAME="589"></A>that they must have existed before in an unmixed form, and because nature 
<A NAME="590"></A>does not allow any chance thing to be mixed with any chance thing, and 
<A NAME="591"></A>also because on this view modifications and accidents could be separated 
<A NAME="592"></A>from substances (for the same things which are mixed can be separated); 
<A NAME="593"></A>yet if one were to follow him up, piecing together what he means, he would 
<A NAME="594"></A>perhaps be seen to be somewhat modern in his views. For when nothing was 
<A NAME="595"></A>separated out, evidently nothing could be truly asserted of the substance 
<A NAME="596"></A>that then existed. I mean, e.g. that it was neither white nor black, nor 
<A NAME="597"></A>grey nor any other colour, but of necessity colourless; for if it had been 
<A NAME="598"></A>coloured, it would have had one of these colours. And similarly, by this 
<A NAME="599"></A>same argument, it was flavourless, nor had it any similar attribute; for 
<A NAME="600"></A>it could not be either of any quality or of any size, nor could it be any 
<A NAME="601"></A>definite kind of thing. For if it were, one of the particular forms would 
<A NAME="602"></A>have belonged to it, and this is impossible, since all were mixed together; 
<A NAME="603"></A>for the particular form would necessarily have been already separated out, 
<A NAME="604"></A>but he all were mixed except reason, and this alone was unmixed and pure. 
<A NAME="605"></A>From this it follows, then, that he must say the principles are the One 
<A NAME="606"></A>(for this is simple and unmixed) and the Other, which is of such a nature 
<A NAME="607"></A>as we suppose the indefinite to be before it is defined and partakes of 
<A NAME="608"></A>some form. Therefore, while expressing himself neither rightly nor clearly, 
<A NAME="609"></A>he means something like what the later thinkers say and what is now more 
<A NAME="610"></A>clearly seen to be the case. <BR><BR>"But these thinkers are, after all, 
<A NAME="611"></A>at home only in arguments about generation and destruction and movement; 
<A NAME="612"></A>for it is practically only of this sort of substance that they seek the 
<A NAME="613"></A>principles and the causes. But those who extend their vision to all things 
<A NAME="614"></A>that exist, and of existing things suppose some to be perceptible and others 
<A NAME="615"></A>not perceptible, evidently study both classes, which is all the more reason 
<A NAME="616"></A>why one should devote some time to seeing what is good in their views and 
<A NAME="617"></A>what bad from the standpoint of the inquiry we have now before us. <BR><BR>"The 
<A NAME="618"></A>'Pythagoreans' treat of principles and elements stranger than those of 
<A NAME="619"></A>the physical philosophers (the reason is that they got the principles from 
<A NAME="620"></A>non-sensible things, for the objects of mathematics, except those of astronomy, 
<A NAME="621"></A>are of the class of things without movement); yet their discussions and 
<A NAME="622"></A>investigations are all about nature; for they generate the heavens, and 
<A NAME="623"></A>with regard to their parts and attributes and functions they observe the 
<A NAME="624"></A>phenomena, and use up the principles and the causes in explaining these, 
<A NAME="625"></A>which implies that they agree with the others, the physical philosophers, 
<A NAME="626"></A>that the real is just all that which is perceptible and contained by the 
<A NAME="627"></A>so-called 'heavens'. But the causes and the principles which they mention 
<A NAME="628"></A>are, as we said, sufficient to act as steps even up to the higher realms 
<A NAME="629"></A>of reality, and are more suited to these than to theories about nature. 
<A NAME="630"></A>They do not tell us at all, however, how there can be movement if limit 
<A NAME="631"></A>and unlimited and odd and even are the only things assumed, or how without 
<A NAME="632"></A>movement and change there can be generation and destruction, or the bodies 
<A NAME="633"></A>that move through the heavens can do what they do. <BR><BR>"Further, if 
<A NAME="634"></A>one either granted them that spatial magnitude consists of these elements, 
<A NAME="635"></A>or this were proved, still how would some bodies be light and others have 
<A NAME="636"></A>weight? To judge from what they assume and maintain they are speaking no 
<A NAME="637"></A>more of mathematical bodies than of perceptible; hence they have said nothing 
<A NAME="638"></A>whatever about fire or earth or the other bodies of this sort, I suppose 
<A NAME="639"></A>because they have nothing to say which applies peculiarly to perceptible 
<A NAME="640"></A>things. <BR><BR>"Further, how are we to combine the beliefs that the attributes 
<A NAME="641"></A>of number, and number itself, are causes of what exists and happens in 
<A NAME="642"></A>the heavens both from the beginning and now, and that there is no other 
<A NAME="643"></A>number than this number out of which the world is composed? When in one 
<A NAME="644"></A>particular region they place opinion and opportunity, and, a little above 
<A NAME="645"></A>or below, injustice and decision or mixture, and allege, as proof, that 
<A NAME="646"></A>each of these is a number, and that there happens to be already in this 
<A NAME="647"></A>place a plurality of the extended bodies composed of numbers, because these 
<A NAME="648"></A>attributes of number attach to the various places,-this being so, is this 
<A NAME="649"></A>number, which we must suppose each of these abstractions to be, the same 
<A NAME="650"></A>number which is exhibited in the material universe, or is it another than 
<A NAME="651"></A>this? Plato says it is different; yet even he thinks that both these bodies 
<A NAME="652"></A>and their causes are numbers, but that the intelligible numbers are causes, 
<A NAME="653"></A>while the others are sensible.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="654"></A><B>Part 9</B>
<A NAME="655"></A>"<BR><BR>
<A NAME="656"></A><BR><BR>"Let us leave the Pythagoreans for the present; for it is enough 
<A NAME="657"></A>to have touched on them as much as we have done. But as for those who posit 
<A NAME="658"></A>the Ideas as causes, firstly, in seeking to grasp the causes of the things 
<A NAME="659"></A>around us, they introduced others equal in number to these, as if a man 
<A NAME="660"></A>who wanted to count things thought he would not be able to do it while 
<A NAME="661"></A>they were few, but tried to count them when he had added to their number. 
<A NAME="662"></A>For the Forms are practically equal to-or not fewer than-the things, in 
<A NAME="663"></A>trying to explain which these thinkers proceeded from them to the Forms. 
<A NAME="664"></A>For to each thing there answers an entity which has the same name and exists 
<A NAME="665"></A>apart from the substances, and so also in the case of all other groups 
<A NAME="666"></A>there is a one over many, whether the many are in this world or are eternal. 
<A NAME="667"></A><BR><BR>"Further, of the ways in which we prove that the Forms exist, none 
<A NAME="668"></A>is convincing; for from some no inference necessarily follows, and from 
<A NAME="669"></A>some arise Forms even of things of which we think there are no Forms. For 
<A NAME="670"></A>according to the arguments from the existence of the sciences there will 
<A NAME="671"></A>be Forms of all things of which there are sciences and according to the 
<A NAME="672"></A>'one over many' argument there will be Forms even of negations, and according 
<A NAME="673"></A>to the argument that there is an object for thought even when the thing 
<A NAME="674"></A>has perished, there will be Forms of perishable things; for we have an 
<A NAME="675"></A>image of these. Further, of the more accurate arguments, some lead to Ideas 
<A NAME="676"></A>of relations, of which we say there is no independent class, and others 
<A NAME="677"></A>introduce the 'third man'. <BR><BR>"And in general the arguments for the 
<A NAME="678"></A>Forms destroy the things for whose existence we are more zealous than for 
<A NAME="679"></A>the existence of the Ideas; for it follows that not the dyad but number 
<A NAME="680"></A>is first, i.e. that the relative is prior to the absolute,-besides all 
<A NAME="681"></A>the other points on which certain people by following out the opinions 
<A NAME="682"></A>held about the Ideas have come into conflict with the principles of the 
<A NAME="683"></A>theory. <BR><BR>"Further, according to the assumption on which our belief 
<A NAME="684"></A>in the Ideas rests, there will be Forms not only of substances but also 
<A NAME="685"></A>of many other things (for the concept is single not only in the case of 
<A NAME="686"></A>substances but also in the other cases, and there are sciences not only 
<A NAME="687"></A>of substance but also of other things, and a thousand other such difficulties 
<A NAME="688"></A>confront them). But according to the necessities of the case and the opinions 
<A NAME="689"></A>held about the Forms, if Forms can be shared in there must be Ideas of 
<A NAME="690"></A>substances only. For they are not shared in incidentally, but a thing must 
<A NAME="691"></A>share in its Form as in something not predicated of a subject (by 'being 
<A NAME="692"></A>shared in incidentally' I mean that e.g. if a thing shares in 'double itself', 
<A NAME="693"></A>it shares also in 'eternal', but incidentally; for 'eternal' happens to 
<A NAME="694"></A>be predicable of the 'double'). Therefore the Forms will be substance; 
<A NAME="695"></A>but the same terms indicate substance in this and in the ideal world (or 
<A NAME="696"></A>what will be the meaning of saying that there is something apart from the 
<A NAME="697"></A>particulars-the one over many?). And if the Ideas and the particulars that 
<A NAME="698"></A>share in them have the same form, there will be something common to these; 
<A NAME="699"></A>for why should '2' be one and the same in the perishable 2's or in those 
<A NAME="700"></A>which are many but eternal, and not the same in the '2' itself' as in the 
<A NAME="701"></A>particular 2? But if they have not the same form, they must have only the 
<A NAME="702"></A>name in common, and it is as if one were to call both Callias and a wooden 
<A NAME="703"></A>image a 'man', without observing any community between them. <BR><BR>"Above 
<A NAME="704"></A>all one might discuss the question what on earth the Forms contribute to 
<A NAME="705"></A>sensible things, either to those that are eternal or to those that come 
<A NAME="706"></A>into being and cease to be. For they cause neither movement nor any change 
<A NAME="707"></A>in them. But again they help in no wise either towards the knowledge of 
<A NAME="708"></A>the other things (for they are not even the substance of these, else they 
<A NAME="709"></A>would have been in them), or towards their being, if they are not in the 
<A NAME="710"></A>particulars which share in them; though if they were, they might be thought 
<A NAME="711"></A>to be causes, as white causes whiteness in a white object by entering into 
<A NAME="712"></A>its composition. But this argument, which first Anaxagoras and later Eudoxus 
<A NAME="713"></A>and certain others used, is very easily upset; for it is not difficult 
<A NAME="714"></A>to collect many insuperable objections to such a view. <BR><BR>"But, further, 
<A NAME="715"></A>all other things cannot come from the Forms in any of the usual senses 
<A NAME="716"></A>of 'from'. And to say that they are patterns and the other things share 
<A NAME="717"></A>in them is to use empty words and poetical metaphors. For what is it that 
<A NAME="718"></A>works, looking to the Ideas? And anything can either be, or become, like 
<A NAME="719"></A>another without being copied from it, so that whether Socrates or not a 
<A NAME="720"></A>man Socrates like might come to be; and evidently this might be so even 
<A NAME="721"></A>if Socrates were eternal. And there will be several patterns of the same 
<A NAME="722"></A>thing, and therefore several Forms; e.g. 'animal' and 'two-footed' and 
<A NAME="723"></A>also 'man himself' will be Forms of man. Again, the Forms are patterns 
<A NAME="724"></A>not only sensible things, but of Forms themselves also; i.e. the genus, 
<A NAME="725"></A>as genus of various species, will be so; therefore the same thing will 
<A NAME="726"></A>be pattern and copy. <BR><BR>"Again, it would seem impossible that the 
<A NAME="727"></A>substance and that of which it is the substance should exist apart; how, 
<A NAME="728"></A>therefore, could the Ideas, being the substances of things, exist apart? 
<A NAME="729"></A>In the Phaedo' the case is stated in this way-that the Forms are causes 
<A NAME="730"></A>both of being and of becoming; yet when the Forms exist, still the things 
<A NAME="731"></A>that share in them do not come into being, unless there is something to 
<A NAME="732"></A>originate movement; and many other things come into being (e.g. a house 
<A NAME="733"></A>or a ring) of which we say there are no Forms. Clearly, therefore, even 
<A NAME="734"></A>the other things can both be and come into being owing to such causes as 
<A NAME="735"></A>produce the things just mentioned. <BR><BR>"Again, if the Forms are numbers, 
<A NAME="736"></A>how can they be causes? Is it because existing things are other numbers, 
<A NAME="737"></A>e.g. one number is man, another is Socrates, another Callias? Why then 
<A NAME="738"></A>are the one set of numbers causes of the other set? It will not make any 
<A NAME="739"></A>difference even if the former are eternal and the latter are not. But if 
<A NAME="740"></A>it is because things in this sensible world (e.g. harmony) are ratios of 
<A NAME="741"></A>numbers, evidently the things between which they are ratios are some one 
<A NAME="742"></A>class of things. If, then, this--the matter--is some definite thing, evidently 
<A NAME="743"></A>the numbers themselves too will be ratios of something to something else. 
<A NAME="744"></A>E.g. if Callias is a numerical ratio between fire and earth and water and 
<A NAME="745"></A>air, his Idea also will be a number of certain other underlying things; 
<A NAME="746"></A>and man himself, whether it is a number in a sense or not, will still be 
<A NAME="747"></A>a numerical ratio of certain things and not a number proper, nor will it 
<A NAME="748"></A>be a of number merely because it is a numerical ratio. <BR><BR>"Again, 
<A NAME="749"></A>from many numbers one number is produced, but how can one Form come from 
<A NAME="750"></A>many Forms? And if the number comes not from the many numbers themselves 
<A NAME="751"></A>but from the units in them, e.g. in 10,000, how is it with the units? If 
<A NAME="752"></A>they are specifically alike, numerous absurdities will follow, and also 
<A NAME="753"></A>if they are not alike (neither the units in one number being themselves 
<A NAME="754"></A>like one another nor those in other numbers being all like to all); for 
<A NAME="755"></A>in what will they differ, as they are without quality? This is not a plausible 
<A NAME="756"></A>view, nor is it consistent with our thought on the matter. <BR><BR>"Further, 
<A NAME="757"></A>they must set up a second kind of number (with which arithmetic deals), 
<A NAME="758"></A>and all the objects which are called 'intermediate' by some thinkers; and 
<A NAME="759"></A>how do these exist or from what principles do they proceed? Or why must 
<A NAME="760"></A>they be intermediate between the things in this sensible world and the 
<A NAME="761"></A>things-themselves? <BR><BR>"Further, the units in must each come from a 
<A NAME="762"></A>prior but this is impossible. <BR><BR>"Further, why is a number, when taken 
<A NAME="763"></A>all together, one? <BR><BR>"Again, besides what has been said, if the units 
<A NAME="764"></A>are diverse the Platonists should have spoken like those who say there 
<A NAME="765"></A>are four, or two, elements; for each of these thinkers gives the name of 
<A NAME="766"></A>element not to that which is common, e.g. to body, but to fire and earth, 
<A NAME="767"></A>whether there is something common to them, viz. body, or not. But in fact 
<A NAME="768"></A>the Platonists speak as if the One were homogeneous like fire or water; 
<A NAME="769"></A>and if this is so, the numbers will not be substances. Evidently, if there 
<A NAME="770"></A>is a One itself and this is a first principle, 'one' is being used in more 
<A NAME="771"></A>than one sense; for otherwise the theory is impossible. <BR><BR>"When we 
<A NAME="772"></A>wish to reduce substances to their principles, we state that lines come 
<A NAME="773"></A>from the short and long (i.e. from a kind of small and great), and the 
<A NAME="774"></A>plane from the broad and narrow, and body from the deep and shallow. Yet 
<A NAME="775"></A>how then can either the plane contain a line, or the solid a line or a 
<A NAME="776"></A>plane? For the broad and narrow is a different class from the deep and 
<A NAME="777"></A>shallow. Therefore, just as number is not present in these, because the 
<A NAME="778"></A>many and few are different from these, evidently no other of the higher 
<A NAME="779"></A>classes will be present in the lower. But again the broad is not a genus 
<A NAME="780"></A>which includes the deep, for then the solid would have been a species of 
<A NAME="781"></A>plane. Further, from what principle will the presence of the points in 
<A NAME="782"></A>the line be derived? Plato even used to object to this class of things 
<A NAME="783"></A>as being a geometrical fiction. He gave the name of principle of the line-and 
<A NAME="784"></A>this he often posited-to the indivisible lines. Yet these must have a limit; 
<A NAME="785"></A>therefore the argument from which the existence of the line follows proves 
<A NAME="786"></A>also the existence of the point. <BR><BR>"In general, though philosophy 
<A NAME="787"></A>seeks the cause of perceptible things, we have given this up (for we say 
<A NAME="788"></A>nothing of the cause from which change takes its start), but while we fancy 
<A NAME="789"></A>we are stating the substance of perceptible things, we assert the existence 
<A NAME="790"></A>of a second class of substances, while our account of the way in which 
<A NAME="791"></A>they are the substances of perceptible things is empty talk; for 'sharing', 
<A NAME="792"></A>as we said before, means nothing. <BR><BR>"Nor have the Forms any connexion 
<A NAME="793"></A>with what we see to be the cause in the case of the arts, that for whose 
<A NAME="794"></A>sake both all mind and the whole of nature are operative,-with this cause 
<A NAME="795"></A>which we assert to be one of the first principles; but mathematics has 
<A NAME="796"></A>come to be identical with philosophy for modern thinkers, though they say 
<A NAME="797"></A>that it should be studied for the sake of other things. Further, one might 
<A NAME="798"></A>suppose that the substance which according to them underlies as matter 
<A NAME="799"></A>is too mathematical, and is a predicate and differentia of the substance, 
<A NAME="800"></A>ie. of the matter, rather than matter itself; i.e. the great and the small 
<A NAME="801"></A>are like the rare and the dense which the physical philosophers speak of, 
<A NAME="802"></A>calling these the primary differentiae of the substratum; for these are 
<A NAME="803"></A>a kind of excess and defect. And regarding movement, if the great and the 
<A NAME="804"></A>small are to he movement, evidently the Forms will be moved; but if they 
<A NAME="805"></A>are not to be movement, whence did movement come? The whole study of nature 
<A NAME="806"></A>has been annihilated. <BR><BR>"And what is thought to be easy-to show that 
<A NAME="807"></A>all things are one-is not done; for what is proved by the method of setting 
<A NAME="808"></A>out instances is not that all things are one but that there is a One itself,-if 
<A NAME="809"></A>we grant all the assumptions. And not even this follows, if we do not grant 
<A NAME="810"></A>that the universal is a genus; and this in some cases it cannot be. <BR><BR>"Nor 
<A NAME="811"></A>can it be explained either how the lines and planes and solids that come 
<A NAME="812"></A>after the numbers exist or can exist, or what significance they have; for 
<A NAME="813"></A>these can neither be Forms (for they are not numbers), nor the intermediates 
<A NAME="814"></A>(for those are the objects of mathematics), nor the perishable things. 
<A NAME="815"></A>This is evidently a distinct fourth class. <BR><BR>"In general, if we search 
<A NAME="816"></A>for the elements of existing things without distinguishing the many senses 
<A NAME="817"></A>in which things are said to exist, we cannot find them, especially if the 
<A NAME="818"></A>search for the elements of which things are made is conducted in this manner. 
<A NAME="819"></A>For it is surely impossible to discover what 'acting' or 'being acted on', 
<A NAME="820"></A>or 'the straight', is made of, but if elements can be discovered at all, 
<A NAME="821"></A>it is only the elements of substances; therefore either to seek the elements 
<A NAME="822"></A>of all existing things or to think one has them is incorrect. <BR><BR>"And 
<A NAME="823"></A>how could we learn the elements of all things? Evidently we cannot start 
<A NAME="824"></A>by knowing anything before. For as he who is learning geometry, though 
<A NAME="825"></A>he may know other things before, knows none of the things with which the 
<A NAME="826"></A>science deals and about which he is to learn, so is it in all other cases. 
<A NAME="827"></A>Therefore if there is a science of all things, such as some assert to exist, 
<A NAME="828"></A>he who is learning this will know nothing before. Yet all learning is by 
<A NAME="829"></A>means of premisses which are (either all or some of them) known before,-whether 
<A NAME="830"></A>the learning be by demonstration or by definitions; for the elements of 
<A NAME="831"></A>the definition must be known before and be familiar; and learning by induction 
<A NAME="832"></A>proceeds similarly. But again, if the science were actually innate, it 
<A NAME="833"></A>were strange that we are unaware of our possession of the greatest of sciences. 
<A NAME="834"></A><BR><BR>"Again, how is one to come to know what all things are made of, 
<A NAME="835"></A>and how is this to be made evident? This also affords a difficulty; for 
<A NAME="836"></A>there might be a conflict of opinion, as there is about certain syllables; 
<A NAME="837"></A>some say za is made out of s and d and a, while others say it is a distinct 
<A NAME="838"></A>sound and none of those that are familiar. <BR><BR>"Further, how could 
<A NAME="839"></A>we know the objects of sense without having the sense in question? Yet 
<A NAME="840"></A>we ought to, if the elements of which all things consist, as complex sounds 
<A NAME="841"></A>consist of the clements proper to sound, are the same.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="842"></A><B>Part 10</B>
<A NAME="843"></A>"<BR><BR>
<A NAME="844"></A><BR><BR>"It is evident, then, even from what we have said before, that 
<A NAME="845"></A>all men seem to seek the causes named in the Physics, and that we cannot 
<A NAME="846"></A>name any beyond these; but they seek these vaguely; and though in a sense 
<A NAME="847"></A>they have all been described before, in a sense they have not been described 
<A NAME="848"></A>at all. For the earliest philosophy is, on all subjects, like one who lisps, 
<A NAME="849"></A>since it is young and in its beginnings. For even Empedocles says bone 
<A NAME="850"></A>exists by virtue of the ratio in it. Now this is the essence and the substance 
<A NAME="851"></A>of the thing. But it is similarly necessary that flesh and each of the 
<A NAME="852"></A>other tissues should be the ratio of its elements, or that not one of them 
<A NAME="853"></A>should; for it is on account of this that both flesh and bone and everything 
<A NAME="854"></A>else will exist, and not on account of the matter, which he names,-fire 
<A NAME="855"></A>and earth and water and air. But while he would necessarily have agreed 
<A NAME="856"></A>if another had said this, he has not said it clearly. <BR><BR>"On these 
<A NAME="857"></A>questions our views have been expressed before; but let us return to enumerate 
<A NAME="858"></A>the difficulties that might be raised on these same points; for perhaps 
<A NAME="859"></A>we may get from them some help towards our later difficulties.
