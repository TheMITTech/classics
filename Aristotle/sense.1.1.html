<A NAME="10"></A><B>Part 1</B>
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="11"></A>Having now definitely considered the soul, by itself, and its several faculties, 
<A NAME="12"></A>we must next make a survey of animals and all living things, in order to 
<A NAME="13"></A>ascertain what functions are peculiar, and what functions are common, to 
<A NAME="14"></A>them. What has been already determined respecting the soul  [sc. by itself] 
<A NAME="15"></A> must be assumed throughout. The remaining parts  [sc. the attributes of 
<A NAME="16"></A>soul and body conjointly]  of our subject must be now dealt with, and we 
<A NAME="17"></A>may begin with those that come first.
<A NAME="18"></A><BR><BR>The most important attributes of animals, whether common to all 
<A NAME="19"></A>or peculiar to some, are, manifestly, attributes of soul and body in conjunction, 
<A NAME="20"></A>e.g. sensation, memory, passion, appetite and desire in general, and, in 
<A NAME="21"></A>addition pleasure and pain. For these may, in fact, be said to belong to 
<A NAME="22"></A>all animals. But there are, besides these, certain other attributes, of 
<A NAME="23"></A>which some are common to all living things, while others are peculiar to 
<A NAME="24"></A>certain species of animals. The most important of these may be summed up 
<A NAME="25"></A>in four pairs, viz. waking and sleeping, youth and old age, inhalation 
<A NAME="26"></A>and exhalation, life and death. We must endeavour to arrive at a scientific 
<A NAME="27"></A>conception of these, determining their respective natures, and the causes 
<A NAME="28"></A>of their occurrence.
<A NAME="29"></A><BR><BR>But it behoves the Physical Philosopher to obtain also a clear 
<A NAME="30"></A>view of the first principles of health and disease, inasmuch as neither 
<A NAME="31"></A>health nor disease can exist in lifeless things. Indeed we may say of most 
<A NAME="32"></A>physical inquirers, and of those physicians who study their art philosophically, 
<A NAME="33"></A>that while the former complete their works with a disquisition on medicine, 
<A NAME="34"></A>the latter usually base their medical theories on principles derived from 
<A NAME="35"></A>Physics.
<A NAME="36"></A><BR><BR>That all the attributes above enumerated belong to soul and body 
<A NAME="37"></A>in conjunction, is obvious; for they all either imply sensation as a concomitant, 
<A NAME="38"></A>or have it as their medium. Some are either affections or states of sensation, 
<A NAME="39"></A>others, means of defending and safe-guarding it, while others, again, involve 
<A NAME="40"></A>its destruction or negation. Now it is clear, alike by reasoning and observation, 
<A NAME="41"></A>that sensation is generated in the soul through the medium of the 
<A NAME="42"></A>body.
<A NAME="43"></A><BR><BR>We have already, in our treatise On the Soul, explained the nature 
<A NAME="44"></A>of sensation and the act of perceiving by sense, and the reason why this 
<A NAME="45"></A>affection belongs to animals. Sensation must, indeed, be attributed to 
<A NAME="46"></A>all animals as such, for by its presence or absence we distinguish essentially 
<A NAME="47"></A>between what is and what is not an animal.
<A NAME="48"></A><BR><BR>But coming now to the special senses severally, we may say that 
<A NAME="49"></A>touch and taste necessarily appertain to all animals, touch, for the reason 
<A NAME="50"></A>given in On the Soul, and taste, because of nutrition. It is by taste that 
<A NAME="51"></A>one distinguishes in food the pleasant from the unpleasant, so as to flee 
<A NAME="52"></A>from the latter and pursue the former: and savour in general is an affection 
<A NAME="53"></A>of nutrient matter.
<A NAME="54"></A><BR><BR>The senses which operate through external media, viz. smelling, 
<A NAME="55"></A>hearing, seeing, are found in all animals which possess the faculty of 
<A NAME="56"></A>locomotion. To all that possess them they are a means of preservation; 
<A NAME="57"></A>their final cause being that such creatures may, guided by antecedent perception, 
<A NAME="58"></A>both pursue their food, and shun things that are bad or destructive. But 
<A NAME="59"></A>in animals which have also intelligence they serve for the attainment of 
<A NAME="60"></A>a higher perfection. They bring in tidings of many distinctive qualities 
<A NAME="61"></A>of things, from which the knowledge of truth, speculative and practical, 
<A NAME="62"></A>is generated in the soul.
<A NAME="63"></A><BR><BR>Of the two last mentioned, seeing, regarded as a supply for the 
<A NAME="64"></A>primary wants of life, and in its direct effects, is the superior sense; 
<A NAME="65"></A>but for developing intelligence, and in its indirect consequences, hearing 
<A NAME="66"></A>takes the precedence. The faculty of seeing, thanks to the fact that all 
<A NAME="67"></A>bodies are coloured, brings tidings of multitudes of distinctive qualities 
<A NAME="68"></A>of all sorts; whence it is through this sense especially that we perceive 
<A NAME="69"></A>the common sensibles, viz. figure, magnitude, motion, number: while hearing 
<A NAME="70"></A>announces only the distinctive qualities of sound, and, to some few animals, 
<A NAME="71"></A>those also of voice. indirectly, however, it is hearing that contributes 
<A NAME="72"></A>most to the growth of intelligence. For rational discourse is a cause of 
<A NAME="73"></A>instruction in virtue of its being audible, which it is, not directly, 
<A NAME="74"></A>but indirectly; since it is composed of words, and each word is a thought-symbol. 
<A NAME="75"></A>Accordingly, of persons destitute from birth of either sense, the blind 
<A NAME="76"></A>are more intelligent than the deaf and dumb.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="77"></A><B>Part 2</B>

<A NAME="78"></A><BR><BR>Of the distinctive potency of each of the faculties of sense enough 
<A NAME="79"></A>has been said already.
<A NAME="80"></A><BR><BR>But as to the nature of the sensory organs, or parts of the body 
<A NAME="81"></A>in which each of the senses is naturally implanted, inquirers now usually 
<A NAME="82"></A>take as their guide the fundamental elements of bodies. Not, however, finding 
<A NAME="83"></A>it easy to coordinate five senses with four elements, they are at a loss 
<A NAME="84"></A>respecting the fifth sense. But they hold the organ of sight to consist 
<A NAME="85"></A>of fire, being prompted to this view by a certain sensory affection of 
<A NAME="86"></A>whose true cause they are ignorant. This is that, when the eye is pressed 
<A NAME="87"></A>or moved, fire appears to flash from it. This naturally takes place in 
<A NAME="88"></A>darkness, or when the eyelids are closed, for then, too, darkness is 
<A NAME="89"></A>produced.
<A NAME="90"></A><BR><BR>This theory, however, solves one question only to raise another; 
<A NAME="91"></A>for, unless on the hypothesis that a person who is in his full senses can 
<A NAME="92"></A>see an object of vision without being aware of it, the eye must on this 
<A NAME="93"></A>theory see itself. But then why does the above affection not occur also 
<A NAME="94"></A>when the eye is at rest? The true explanation of this affection, which 
<A NAME="95"></A>will contain the answer to our question, and account for the current notion 
<A NAME="96"></A>that the eye consists of fire, must be determined in the following way: 
<A NAME="97"></A>Things which are smooth have the natural property of shining in darkness, 
<A NAME="98"></A>without, however, producing light. Now, the part of the eye called 'the 
<A NAME="99"></A>black', i.e. its central part, is manifestly smooth. The phenomenon of 
<A NAME="100"></A>the flash occurs only when the eye is moved, because only then could it 
<A NAME="101"></A>possibly occur that the same one object should become as it were two. The 
<A NAME="102"></A>rapidity of the movement has the effect of making that which sees and that 
<A NAME="103"></A>which is seen seem different from one another. Hence the phenomenon does 
<A NAME="104"></A>not occur unless the motion is rapid and takes place in darkness. For it 
<A NAME="105"></A>is in the dark that that which is smooth, e.g. the heads of certain fishes, 
<A NAME="106"></A>and the sepia of the cuttle-fish, naturally shines, and, when the movement 
<A NAME="107"></A>of the eye is slow, it is impossible that that which sees and that which 
<A NAME="108"></A>is seen should appear to be simultaneously two and one. But, in fact, the 
<A NAME="109"></A>eye sees itself in the above phenomenon merely as it does so in ordinary 
<A NAME="110"></A>optical reflexion.
<A NAME="111"></A><BR><BR>If the visual organ proper really were fire, which is the doctrine 
<A NAME="112"></A>of Empedocles, a doctrine taught also in the Timaeus, and if vision were 
<A NAME="113"></A>the result of light issuing from the eye as from a lantern, why should 
<A NAME="114"></A>the eye not have had the power of seeing even in the dark? It is totally 
<A NAME="115"></A>idle to say, as the Timaeus does, that the visual ray coming forth in the 
<A NAME="116"></A>darkness is quenched. What is the meaning of this 'quenching' of light? 
<A NAME="117"></A>That which, like a fire of coals or an ordinary flame, is hot and dry is, 
<A NAME="118"></A>indeed, quenched by the moist or cold; but heat and dryness are evidently 
<A NAME="119"></A>not attributes of light. Or if they are attributes of it, but belong to 
<A NAME="120"></A>it in a degree so slight as to be imperceptible to us, we should have expected 
<A NAME="121"></A>that in the daytime the light of the sun should be quenched when rain falls, 
<A NAME="122"></A>and that darkness should prevail in frosty weather. Flame, for example, 
<A NAME="123"></A>and ignited bodies are subject to such extinction, but experience shows 
<A NAME="124"></A>that nothing of this sort happens to the sunlight.
<A NAME="125"></A><BR><BR>Empedocles at times seems to hold that vision is to be explained 
<A NAME="126"></A>as above stated by light issuing forth from the eye, e.g. in the following 
<A NAME="127"></A>passage:-
<A NAME="128"></A><BR><BR>As when one who purposes going abroad prepares a 
<A NAME="129"></A>lantern,
<A NAME="130"></A><BR>A gleam of fire blazing through the stormy night,
<A NAME="131"></A><BR>Adjusting thereto, to screen it from all sorts of 
<A NAME="132"></A>winds,
<A NAME="133"></A><BR>transparent sides,
<A NAME="134"></A><BR>Which scatter the breath of the winds as they blow,
<A NAME="135"></A><BR>While, out through them leaping, the fire,
<A NAME="136"></A><BR>i.e. all the more subtile part of this,
<A NAME="137"></A><BR>Shines along his threshold old incessant beams:
<A NAME="138"></A><BR>So [Divine love] embedded the round "lens", [viz.]
<A NAME="139"></A><BR>the primaeval fire fenced within the membranes,
<A NAME="140"></A><BR>In [its own] delicate tissues;
<A NAME="141"></A><BR>And these fended off the deep surrounding flood,
<A NAME="142"></A><BR>While leaping forth the fire, i.e. all its more subtile 
<A NAME="143"></A>part-.
<A NAME="144"></A><BR><BR>Sometimes he accounts for vision thus, but at other times he explains 
<A NAME="145"></A>it by emanations from the visible objects.
<A NAME="146"></A><BR><BR>Democritus, on the other hand, is right in his opinion that the 
<A NAME="147"></A>eye is of water; not, however, when he goes on to explain seeing as mere 
<A NAME="148"></A>mirroring. The mirroring that takes place in an eye is due to the fact 
<A NAME="149"></A>that the eye is smooth, and it really has its seat not in the eye which 
<A NAME="150"></A>is seen, but in that which sees. For the case is merely one of reflexion. 
<A NAME="151"></A>But it would seem that even in his time there was no scientific knowledge 
<A NAME="152"></A>of the general subject of the formation of images and the phenomena of 
<A NAME="153"></A>reflexion. It is strange too, that it never occurred to him to ask why, 
<A NAME="154"></A>if his theory be true, the eye alone sees, while none of the other things 
<A NAME="155"></A>in which images are reflected do so.
<A NAME="156"></A><BR><BR>True, then, the visual organ proper is composed of water, yet vision 
<A NAME="157"></A>appertains to it not because it is so composed, but because it is translucent- 
<A NAME="158"></A>a property common alike to water and to air. But water is more easily confined 
<A NAME="159"></A>and more easily condensed than air; wherefore it is that the pupil, i.e. 
<A NAME="160"></A>the eye proper, consists of water. That it does so is proved by facts of 
<A NAME="161"></A>actual experience. The substance which flows from eyes when decomposing 
<A NAME="162"></A>is seen to be water, and this in undeveloped embryos is remarkably cold 
<A NAME="163"></A>and glistening. In sanguineous animals the white of the eye is fat and 
<A NAME="164"></A>oily, in order that the moisture of the eye may be proof against freezing. 
<A NAME="165"></A>Wherefore the eye is of all parts of the body the least sensitive to cold: 
<A NAME="166"></A>no one ever feels cold in the part sheltered by the eyelids. The eyes of 
<A NAME="167"></A>bloodless animals are covered with a hard scale which gives them similar 
<A NAME="168"></A>protection.
<A NAME="169"></A><BR><BR>It is, to state the matter generally, an irrational notion that 
<A NAME="170"></A>the eye should see in virtue of something issuing from it; that the visual 
<A NAME="171"></A>ray should extend itself all the way to the stars, or else go out merely 
<A NAME="172"></A>to a certain point, and there coalesce, as some say, with rays which proceed 
<A NAME="173"></A>from the object. It would be better to suppose this coalescence to take 
<A NAME="174"></A>place in the fundament of the eye itself. But even this would be mere trifling. 
<A NAME="175"></A>For what is meant by the 'coalescence' of light with light? Or how is it 
<A NAME="176"></A>possible? Coalescence does not occur between any two things taken at random. 
<A NAME="177"></A>And how could the light within the eye coalesce with that outside it? For 
<A NAME="178"></A>the environing membrane comes between them.
<A NAME="179"></A><BR><BR>That without light vision is impossible has been stated elsewhere; 
<A NAME="180"></A>but, whether the medium between the eye and its objects is air or light, 
<A NAME="181"></A>vision is caused by a process through this medium.
<A NAME="182"></A><BR><BR>Accordingly, that the inner part of the eye consists of water is 
<A NAME="183"></A>easily intelligible, water being translucent.
<A NAME="184"></A><BR><BR>Now, as vision outwardly is impossible without [extra-organic] 
<A NAME="185"></A>light, so also it is impossible inwardly [without light within the organ]. 
<A NAME="186"></A>There must, therefore, be some translucent medium within the eye, and, 
<A NAME="187"></A>as this is not air, it must be water. The soul or its perceptive part is 
<A NAME="188"></A>not situated at the external surface of the eye, but obviously somewhere 
<A NAME="189"></A>within: whence the necessity of the interior of the eye being translucent, 
<A NAME="190"></A>i.e. capable of admitting light. And that it is so is plain from actual 
<A NAME="191"></A>occurrences. It is matter of experience that soldiers wounded in battle 
<A NAME="192"></A>by a sword slash on the temple, so inflicted as to sever the passages of 
<A NAME="193"></A>[i.e. inward from] the eye, feel a sudden onset of darkness, as if a lamp 
<A NAME="194"></A>had gone out; because what is called the pupil, i.e. the translucent, which 
<A NAME="195"></A>is a sort of inner lamp, is then cut off [from its connexion with the 
<A NAME="196"></A>soul].
<A NAME="197"></A><BR><BR>Hence, if the facts be at all as here stated, it is clear that- 
<A NAME="198"></A>if one should explain the nature of the sensory organs in this way, i.e. 
<A NAME="199"></A>by correlating each of them with one of the four elements,- we must conceive 
<A NAME="200"></A>that the part of the eye immediately concerned in vision consists of water, 
<A NAME="201"></A>that the part immediately concerned in the perception of sound consists 
<A NAME="202"></A>of air, and that the sense of smell consists of fire. (I say the sense 
<A NAME="203"></A>of smell, not the organ.) For the organ of smell is only potentially that 
<A NAME="204"></A>which the sense of smell, as realized, is actually; since the object of 
<A NAME="205"></A>sense is what causes the actualization of each sense, so that it (the sense) 
<A NAME="206"></A>must (at the instant of actualization) be (actually) that which before 
<A NAME="207"></A>(the moment of actualization) it was potentially. Now, odour is a smoke-like 
<A NAME="208"></A>evaporation, and smoke-like evaporation arises from fire. This also helps 
<A NAME="209"></A>us to understand why the olfactory organ has its proper seat in the environment 
<A NAME="210"></A>of the brain, for cold matter is potentially hot. In the same way must 
<A NAME="211"></A>the genesis of the eye be explained. Its structure is an offshoot from 
<A NAME="212"></A>the brain, because the latter is the moistest and coldest of all the bodily 
<A NAME="213"></A>parts.
<A NAME="214"></A><BR><BR>The organ of touch proper consists of earth, and the faculty of 
<A NAME="215"></A>taste is a particular form of touch. This explains why the sensory organ 
<A NAME="216"></A>of both touch and taste is closely related to the heart. For the heart 
<A NAME="217"></A>as being the hottest of all the bodily parts, is the counterpoise of the 
<A NAME="218"></A>brain.
<A NAME="219"></A><BR><BR>This then is the way in which the characteristics of the bodily 
<A NAME="220"></A>organs of sense must be determined.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="221"></A><B>Part 3</B>

<A NAME="222"></A><BR><BR>Of the sensibles corresponding to each sensory organ, viz. colour, 
<A NAME="223"></A>sound, odour, savour, touch, we have treated in On the Soul in general 
<A NAME="224"></A>terms, having there determined what their function is, and what is implied 
<A NAME="225"></A>in their becoming actualized in relation to their respective organs. We 
<A NAME="226"></A>must next consider what account we are to give of any one of them; what, 
<A NAME="227"></A>for example, we should say colour is, or sound, or odour, or savour; and 
<A NAME="228"></A>so also respecting [the object of] touch. We begin with 
<A NAME="229"></A>colour.
<A NAME="230"></A><BR><BR>Now, each of them may be spoken of from two points of view, i.e. 
<A NAME="231"></A>either as actual or as potential. We have in On the Soul explained in what 
<A NAME="232"></A>sense the colour, or sound, regarded as actualized [for sensation] is the 
<A NAME="233"></A>same as, and in what sense it is different from, the correlative sensation, 
<A NAME="234"></A>the actual seeing or hearing. The point of our present discussion is, therefore, 
<A NAME="235"></A>to determine what each sensible object must be in itself, in order to be 
<A NAME="236"></A>perceived as it is in actual consciousness.
<A NAME="237"></A><BR><BR>We have already in On the Soul stated of Light that it is the colour 
<A NAME="238"></A>of the Translucent, [being so related to it] incidentally; for whenever 
<A NAME="239"></A>a fiery element is in a translucent medium presence there is Light; while 
<A NAME="240"></A>the privation of it is Darkness. But the 'Translucent', as we call it, 
<A NAME="241"></A>is not something peculiar to air, or water, or any other of the bodies 
<A NAME="242"></A>usually called translucent, but is a common 'nature' and power, capable 
<A NAME="243"></A>of no separate existence of its own, but residing in these, and subsisting 
<A NAME="244"></A>likewise in all other bodies in a greater or less degree. As the bodies 
<A NAME="245"></A>in which it subsists must have some extreme bounding surface, so too must 
<A NAME="246"></A>this. Here, then, we may say that Light is a 'nature' inhering in the Translucent 
<A NAME="247"></A>when the latter is without determinate boundary. But it is manifest that, 
<A NAME="248"></A>when the Translucent is in determinate bodies, its bounding extreme must 
<A NAME="249"></A>be something real; and that colour is just this 'something' we are plainly 
<A NAME="250"></A>taught by facts-colour being actually either at the external limit, or 
<A NAME="251"></A>being itself that limit, in bodies. Hence it was that the Pythagoreans 
<A NAME="252"></A>named the superficies of a body its 'hue', for 'hue', indeed, lies at the 
<A NAME="253"></A>limit of the body; but the limit of the body; is not a real thing; rather 
<A NAME="254"></A>we must suppose that the same natural substance which, externally, is the 
<A NAME="255"></A>vehicle of colour exists [as such a possible vehicle] also in the interior 
<A NAME="256"></A>of the body.
<A NAME="257"></A><BR><BR>Air and water, too [i.e. as well as determinately bounded bodies] 
<A NAME="258"></A>are seen to possess colour; for their brightness is of the nature of colour. 
<A NAME="259"></A>But the colour which air or sea presents, since the body in which it resides 
<A NAME="260"></A>is not determinately bounded, is not the same when one approaches and views 
<A NAME="261"></A>it close by as it is when one regards it from a distance; whereas in determinate 
<A NAME="262"></A>bodies the colour presented is definitely fixed, unless, indeed, when the 
<A NAME="263"></A>atmospheric environment causes it to change. Hence it is clear that that 
<A NAME="264"></A>in them which is susceptible of colour is in both cases the same. It is 
<A NAME="265"></A>therefore the Translucent, according to the degree to which it subsists 
<A NAME="266"></A>in bodies (and it does so in all more or less), that causes them to partake 
<A NAME="267"></A>of colour. But since the colour is at the extremity of the body, it must 
<A NAME="268"></A>be at the extremity of the Translucent in the body. Whence it follows that 
<A NAME="269"></A>we may define colour as the limit of the Translucent in determinately bounded 
<A NAME="270"></A>body. For whether we consider the special class of bodies called translucent, 
<A NAME="271"></A>as water and such others, or determinate bodies, which appear to possess 
<A NAME="272"></A>a fixed colour of their own, it is at the exterior bounding surface that 
<A NAME="273"></A>all alike exhibit their colour.
<A NAME="274"></A><BR><BR>Now, that which when present in air produces light may be present 
<A NAME="275"></A>also in the Translucent which pervades determinate bodies; or again, it 
<A NAME="276"></A>may not be present, but there may be a privation of it. Accordingly, as 
<A NAME="277"></A>in the case of air the one condition is light, the other darkness, in the 
<A NAME="278"></A>same way the colours White and Black are generated in determinate 
<A NAME="279"></A>bodies.
<A NAME="280"></A><BR><BR>We must now treat of the other colours, reviewing the several hypotheses 
<A NAME="281"></A>invented to explain their genesis.
<A NAME="282"></A><BR><BR>(1) It is conceivable that the White and the Black should be juxtaposed 
<A NAME="283"></A>in quantities so minute that [a particle of] either separately would be 
<A NAME="284"></A>invisible, though the joint product [of two particles, a black and a white] 
<A NAME="285"></A>would be visible; and that they should thus have the other colours for 
<A NAME="286"></A>resultants. Their product could, at all events, appear neither white nor 
<A NAME="287"></A>black; and, as it must have some colour, and can have neither of these, 
<A NAME="288"></A>this colour must be of a mixed character- in fact, a species of colour 
<A NAME="289"></A>different from either. Such, then, is a possible way of conceiving the 
<A NAME="290"></A>existence of a plurality of colours besides the White and Black; and we 
<A NAME="291"></A>may suppose that [of this 'plurality'] many are the result of a [numerical] 
<A NAME="292"></A>ratio; for the blacks and whites may be juxtaposed in the ratio of 3 to 
<A NAME="293"></A>2 or of 3 to 4, or in ratios expressible by other numbers; while some may 
<A NAME="294"></A>be juxtaposed according to no numerically expressible ratio, but according 
<A NAME="295"></A>to some relation of excess or defect in which the blacks and whites involved 
<A NAME="296"></A>would be incommensurable quantities; and, accordingly, we may regard all 
<A NAME="297"></A>these colours [viz. all those based on numerical ratios] as analogous to 
<A NAME="298"></A>the sounds that enter into music, and suppose that those involving simple 
<A NAME="299"></A>numerical ratios, like the concords in music, may be those generally regarded 
<A NAME="300"></A>as most agreeable; as, for example, purple, crimson, and some few such 
<A NAME="301"></A>colours, their fewness being due to the same causes which render the concords 
<A NAME="302"></A>few. The other compound colours may be those which are not based on numbers. 
<A NAME="303"></A>Or it may be that, while all colours whatever [except black and white] 
<A NAME="304"></A>are based on numbers, some are regular in this respect, others irregular; 
<A NAME="305"></A>and that the latter [though now supposed to be all based on numbers], whenever 
<A NAME="306"></A>they are not pure, owe this character to a corresponding impurity in [the 
<A NAME="307"></A>arrangement of] their numerical ratios. This then is one conceivable hypothesis 
<A NAME="308"></A>to explain the genesis of intermediate colours.
<A NAME="309"></A><BR><BR>(2) Another is that the Black and White appear the one through 
<A NAME="310"></A>the medium of the other, giving an effect like that sometimes produced 
<A NAME="311"></A>by painters overlaying a less vivid upon a more vivid colour, as when they 
<A NAME="312"></A>desire to represent an object appearing under water or enveloped in a haze, 
<A NAME="313"></A>and like that produced by the sun, which in itself appears white, but takes 
<A NAME="314"></A>a crimson hue when beheld through a fog or a cloud of smoke. On this hypothesis, 
<A NAME="315"></A>too, a variety of colours may be conceived to arise in the same way as 
<A NAME="316"></A>that already described; for between those at the surface and those underneath 
<A NAME="317"></A>a definite ratio might sometimes exist; in other cases they might stand 
<A NAME="318"></A>in no determinate ratio. To [introduce a theory of colour which would set 
<A NAME="319"></A>all these hypotheses aside, and] say with the ancients that colours are 
<A NAME="320"></A>emanations, and that the visibility of objects is due to such a cause, 
<A NAME="321"></A>is absurd. For they must, in any case, explain sense-perception through 
<A NAME="322"></A>Touch; so that it were better to say at once that visual perception is 
<A NAME="323"></A>due to a process set up by the perceived object in the medium between this 
<A NAME="324"></A>object and the sensory organ; due, that is, to contact [with the medium 
<A NAME="325"></A>affected,] not to emanations.
<A NAME="326"></A><BR><BR>If we accept the hypothesis of juxtaposition, we must assume not 
<A NAME="327"></A>only invisible magnitude, but also imperceptible time, in order that the 
<A NAME="328"></A>succession in the arrival of the stimulatory movements may be unperceived, 
<A NAME="329"></A>and that the compound colour seen may appear to be one, owing to its successive 
<A NAME="330"></A>parts seeming to present themselves at once. On the hypothesis of superposition, 
<A NAME="331"></A>however, no such assumption is needful: the stimulatory process produced 
<A NAME="332"></A>in the medium by the upper colour, when this is itself unaffected, will 
<A NAME="333"></A>be different in kind from that produced by it when affected by the underlying 
<A NAME="334"></A>colour. Hence it presents itself as a different colour, i.e. as one which 
<A NAME="335"></A>is neither white nor black. So that, if it is impossible to suppose any 
<A NAME="336"></A>magnitude to be invisible, and we must assume that there is some distance 
<A NAME="337"></A>from which every magnitude is visible, this superposition theory, too [i.e. 
<A NAME="338"></A>as well as No. 3 infra], might pass as a real theory of colour-mixture. 
<A NAME="339"></A>Indeed, in the previous case also there is no reason why, to persons at 
<A NAME="340"></A>a distance from the juxtaposed blacks and whites, some one colour should 
<A NAME="341"></A>not appear to present itself as a blend of both. [But it would not be so 
<A NAME="342"></A>on a nearer view], for it will be shown, in a discussion to be undertaken 
<A NAME="343"></A>later on, that there is no magnitude absolutely invisible.
<A NAME="344"></A><BR><BR>(3) There is a mixture of bodies, however, not merely such as some 
<A NAME="345"></A>suppose, i.e. by juxtaposition of their minimal parts, which, owing to 
<A NAME="346"></A>[the weakness of our] sense, are imperceptible by us, but a mixture by 
<A NAME="347"></A>which they [i.e. the 'matter' of which they consist] are wholly blent together 
<A NAME="348"></A>by interpenetration, as we have described it in the treatise on Mixture, 
<A NAME="349"></A>where we dealt with this subject generally in its most comprehensive aspect. 
<A NAME="350"></A>For, on the supposition we are criticizing, the only totals capable of 
<A NAME="351"></A>being mixed are those which are divisible into minimal parts, [e.g. genera 
<A NAME="352"></A>into individuals] as men, horses, or the [various kinds of] seeds. For 
<A NAME="353"></A>of mankind as a whole the individual man is such a least part; of horses 
<A NAME="354"></A>[as an aggregate] the individual horse. Hence by the juxtaposition of these 
<A NAME="355"></A>we obtain a mixed total, consisting [like a troop of cavalry] of both together; 
<A NAME="356"></A>but we do not say that by such a process any individual man has been mixed 
<A NAME="357"></A>with any individual horse. Not in this way, but by complete interpenetration 
<A NAME="358"></A>[of their matter], must we conceive those things to be mixed which are 
<A NAME="359"></A>not divisible into minima; and it is in the case of these that natural 
<A NAME="360"></A>mixture exhibits itself in its most perfect form. We have explained already 
<A NAME="361"></A>in our discourse 'On Mixture' how such mixture is possible. This being 
<A NAME="362"></A>the true nature of mixture, it is plain that when bodies are mixed their 
<A NAME="363"></A>colours also are necessarily mixed at the same time; and [it is no less 
<A NAME="364"></A>plain] that this is the real cause determining the existence of a plurality 
<A NAME="365"></A>of colours- not superposition or juxtaposition. For when bodies are thus 
<A NAME="366"></A>mixed, their resultant colour presents itself as one and the same at all 
<A NAME="367"></A>distances alike; not varying as it is seen nearer or farther 
<A NAME="368"></A>away.
<A NAME="369"></A><BR><BR>Colours will thus, too [as well as on the former hypotheses], be 
<A NAME="370"></A>many in number on account of the fact that the ingredients may be combined 
<A NAME="371"></A>with one another in a multitude of ratios; some will be based on determinate 
<A NAME="372"></A>numerical ratios, while others again will have as their basis a relation 
<A NAME="373"></A>of quantitative excess or defect not expressible in integers. And all else 
<A NAME="374"></A>that was said in reference to the colours, considered as juxtaposed or 
<A NAME="375"></A>superposed, may be said of them likewise when regarded as mixed in the 
<A NAME="376"></A>way just described.
<A NAME="377"></A><BR><BR>Why colours, as well as savours and sounds, consist of species 
<A NAME="378"></A>determinate [in themselves] and not infinite [in number] is a question 
<A NAME="379"></A>which we shall discuss hereafter.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="380"></A><B>Part 4</B>

<A NAME="381"></A><BR><BR>We have now explained what colour is, and the reason why there 
<A NAME="382"></A>are many colours; while before, in our work On the Soul, we explained the 
<A NAME="383"></A>nature of sound and voice. We have next to speak of Odour and Savour, both 
<A NAME="384"></A>of which are almost the same physical affection, although they each have 
<A NAME="385"></A>their being in different things. Savours, as a class, display their nature 
<A NAME="386"></A>more clearly to us than Odours, the cause of which is that the olfactory 
<A NAME="387"></A>sense of man is inferior in acuteness to that of the lower animals, and 
<A NAME="388"></A>is, when compared with our other senses, the least perfect of Man's sense 
<A NAME="389"></A>of Touch, on the contrary, excels that of all other animals in fineness, 
<A NAME="390"></A>and Taste is a modification of Touch.
<A NAME="391"></A><BR><BR>Now the natural substance water per se tends to be tasteless. But 
<A NAME="392"></A>[since without water tasting is impossible] either (a) we must suppose 
<A NAME="393"></A>that water contains in itself [uniformly diffused through it] the various 
<A NAME="394"></A>kinds of savour, already formed, though in amounts so small as to be imperceptible, 
<A NAME="395"></A>which is the doctrine of Empedocles; or (b) the water must be a sort of 
<A NAME="396"></A>matter, qualified, as it were, to produce germs of savours of all kinds, 
<A NAME="397"></A>so that all kinds of savour are generated from the water, though different 
<A NAME="398"></A>kinds from its different parts, or else (c) the water is in itself quite 
<A NAME="399"></A>undifferentiated in respect of savour [whether developed or undeveloped], 
<A NAME="400"></A>but some agent, such for example as one might conceive Heat or the Sun 
<A NAME="401"></A>to be, is the efficient cause of savour.
<A NAME="402"></A><BR><BR>(a) Of these three hypotheses, the falsity of that held by Empedocles 
<A NAME="403"></A>is only too evident. For we see that when pericarpal fruits are plucked 
<A NAME="404"></A>[from the tree] and exposed in the sun, or subjected to the action of fire, 
<A NAME="405"></A>their sapid juices are changed by the heat, which shows that their qualities 
<A NAME="406"></A>are not due to their drawing anything from the water in the ground, but 
<A NAME="407"></A>to a change which they undergo within the pericarp itself; and we see, 
<A NAME="408"></A>moreover, that these juices, when extracted and allowed to lie, instead 
<A NAME="409"></A>of sweet become by lapse of time harsh or bitter, or acquire savours of 
<A NAME="410"></A>any and every sort; and that, again, by the process of boiling or fermentation 
<A NAME="411"></A>they are made to assume almost all kinds of new savours.
<A NAME="412"></A><BR><BR>(b) It is likewise impossible that water should be a material qualified 
<A NAME="413"></A>to generate all kinds of Savour germs [so that different savours should 
<A NAME="414"></A>arise out of different parts of the water]; for we see different kinds 
<A NAME="415"></A>of taste generated from the same water, having it as their 
<A NAME="416"></A>nutriment.
<A NAME="417"></A><BR><BR>(C) It remains, therefore, to suppose that the water is changed 
<A NAME="418"></A>by passively receiving some affection from an external agent. Now, it is 
<A NAME="419"></A>manifest that water does not contract the quality of sapidity from the 
<A NAME="420"></A>agency of Heat alone. For water is of all liquids the thinnest, thinner 
<A NAME="421"></A>even than oil itself, though oil, owing to its viscosity, is more ductile 
<A NAME="422"></A>than water, the latter being uncohesive in its particles; whence water 
<A NAME="423"></A>is more difficult than oil to hold in the hand without spilling. But since 
<A NAME="424"></A>perfectly pure water does not, when subjected to the action of Heat, show 
<A NAME="425"></A>any tendency to acquire consistency, we must infer that some other agency 
<A NAME="426"></A>than heat is the cause of sapidity. For all savours [i.e. sapid liquors] 
<A NAME="427"></A>exhibit a comparative consistency. Heat is, however, a coagent in the 
<A NAME="428"></A>matter.
<A NAME="429"></A><BR><BR>Now the sapid juices found in pericarpal fruits evidently exist 
<A NAME="430"></A>also in the earth. Hence many of the old natural philosophers assert that 
<A NAME="431"></A>water has qualities like those of the earth through which it flows, a fact 
<A NAME="432"></A>especially manifest in the case of saline springs, for salt is a form of 
<A NAME="433"></A>earth. Hence also when liquids are filtered through ashes, a bitter substance, 
<A NAME="434"></A>the taste they yield is bitter. There are many wells, too, of which some 
<A NAME="435"></A>are bitter, others acid, while others exhibit other tastes of all 
<A NAME="436"></A>kinds.
<A NAME="437"></A><BR><BR>As was to be anticipated, therefore, it is in the vegetable kingdom 
<A NAME="438"></A>that tastes occur in richest variety. For, like all things else, the Moist, 
<A NAME="439"></A>by nature's law, is affected only by its contrary; and this contrary is 
<A NAME="440"></A>the Dry. Thus we see why the Moist is affected by Fire, which as a natural 
<A NAME="441"></A>substance, is dry. Heat is, however, the essential property of Fire, as 
<A NAME="442"></A>Dryness is of Earth, according to what has been said in our treatise on 
<A NAME="443"></A>the elements. Fire and Earth, therefore, taken absolutely as such, have 
<A NAME="444"></A>no natural power to affect, or be affected by, one another; nor have any 
<A NAME="445"></A>other pair of substances. Any two things can affect, or be affected by, 
<A NAME="446"></A>one another only so far as contrariety to the other resides in either of 
<A NAME="447"></A>them.
<A NAME="448"></A><BR><BR>As, therefore, persons washing Colours or Savours in a liquid cause 
<A NAME="449"></A>the water in which they wash to acquire such a quality [as that of the 
<A NAME="450"></A>colour or savour], so nature, too, by washing the Dry and Earthy in the 
<A NAME="451"></A>Moist, and by filtering the latter, that is, moving it on by the agency 
<A NAME="452"></A>of heat through the dry and earthy, imparts to it a certain quality. This 
<A NAME="453"></A>affection, wrought by the aforesaid Dry in the Moist, capable of transforming 
<A NAME="454"></A>the sense of Taste from potentiality to actuality, is Savour. Savour brings 
<A NAME="455"></A>into actual exercise the perceptive faculty which pre-existed only in potency. 
<A NAME="456"></A>The activity of sense-perception in general is analogous, not to the process 
<A NAME="457"></A>of acquiring knowledge, but to that of exercising knowledge already 
<A NAME="458"></A>acquired.
<A NAME="459"></A><BR><BR>That Savours, either as a quality or as the privation of a quality, 
<A NAME="460"></A>belong not to every form of the Dry but to the Nutrient, we shall see by 
<A NAME="461"></A>considering that neither the Dry without the Moist, nor the Moist without 
<A NAME="462"></A>the Dry, is nutrient. For no single element, but only composite substance, 
<A NAME="463"></A>constitutes nutriment for animals. Now, among the perceptible elements 
<A NAME="464"></A>of the food which animals assimilate, the tangible are the efficient causes 
<A NAME="465"></A>of growth and decay; it is qua hot or cold that the food assimilated causes 
<A NAME="466"></A>these; for the heat or cold is the direct cause of growth or decay. It 
<A NAME="467"></A>is qua gustable, however, that the assimilated food supplies nutrition. 
<A NAME="468"></A>For all organisms are nourished by the Sweet [i.e. the 'gustable' proper], 
<A NAME="469"></A>either by itself or in combination with other savours. Of this we must 
<A NAME="470"></A>speak with more precise detail in our work on Generation: for the present 
<A NAME="471"></A>we need touch upon it only so far as our subject here requires. Heat causes 
<A NAME="472"></A>growth, and fits the food-stuff for alimentation; it attracts [into the 
<A NAME="473"></A>organic system] that which is light [viz. the sweet], while the salt and 
<A NAME="474"></A>bitter it rejects because of their heaviness. In fact, whatever effects 
<A NAME="475"></A>external heat produces in external bodies, the same are produced by their 
<A NAME="476"></A>internal heat in animal and vegetable organisms. Hence it is [i.e. by the 
<A NAME="477"></A>agency of heat as described] that nourishment is effected by the sweet. 
<A NAME="478"></A>The other savours are introduced into and blended in food [naturally] on 
<A NAME="479"></A>a principle analogous to that on which the saline or the acid is used artificially, 
<A NAME="480"></A>i.e. for seasoning. These latter are used because they counteract the tendency 
<A NAME="481"></A>of the sweet to be too nutrient, and to float on the 
<A NAME="482"></A>stomach.
<A NAME="483"></A><BR><BR>As the intermediate colours arise from the mixture of white and 
<A NAME="484"></A>black, so the intermediate savours arise from the Sweet and Bitter; and 
<A NAME="485"></A>these savours, too, severally involve either a definite ratio, or else 
<A NAME="486"></A>an indefinite relation of degree, between their components, either having 
<A NAME="487"></A>certain integral numbers at the basis of their mixture, and, consequently, 
<A NAME="488"></A>of their stimulative effect, or else being mixed in proportions not arithmetically 
<A NAME="489"></A>expressible. The tastes which give pleasure in their combination are those 
<A NAME="490"></A>which have their components joined in a definite ratio.
<A NAME="491"></A><BR><BR>The sweet taste alone is Rich, [therefore the latter may be regarded 
<A NAME="492"></A>as a variety of the former], while [so far as both imply privation of the 
<A NAME="493"></A>Sweet] the Saline is fairly identical with the Bitter. Between the extremes 
<A NAME="494"></A>of sweet and bitter come the Harsh, the Pungent, the Astringent, and the 
<A NAME="495"></A>Acid. Savours and Colours, it will be observed, contain respectively about 
<A NAME="496"></A>the same number of species. For there are seven species of each, if, as 
<A NAME="497"></A>is reasonable, we regard Dun [or Grey] as a variety of Black (for the alternative 
<A NAME="498"></A>is that Yellow should be classed with White, as Rich with Sweet); while 
<A NAME="499"></A>[the irreducible colours, viz.] Crimson, Violet, leek-Green, and deep Blue, 
<A NAME="500"></A>come between White and Black, and from these all others are derived by 
<A NAME="501"></A>mixture.
<A NAME="502"></A><BR><BR>Again, as Black is a privation of White in the Translucent, so 
<A NAME="503"></A>Saline or Bitter is a privation of Sweet in the Nutrient Moist. This explains 
<A NAME="504"></A>why the ash of all burnt things is bitter; for the potable [sc. the sweet] 
<A NAME="505"></A>moisture has been exuded from them.
<A NAME="506"></A><BR><BR>Democritus and most of the natural philosophers who treat of sense-perception 
<A NAME="507"></A>proceed quite irrationally, for they represent all objects of sense as 
<A NAME="508"></A>objects of Touch. Yet, if this is really so, it clearly follows that each 
<A NAME="509"></A>of the other senses is a mode of Touch; but one can see at a glance that 
<A NAME="510"></A>this is impossible.
<A NAME="511"></A><BR><BR>Again, they treat the percepts common to all senses as proper to 
<A NAME="512"></A>one. For [the qualities by which they explain taste viz.] Magnitude and 
<A NAME="513"></A>Figure, Roughness and Smoothness, and, moreover, the Sharpness and Bluntness 
<A NAME="514"></A>found in solid bodies, are percepts common to all the senses, or if not 
<A NAME="515"></A>to all, at least to Sight and Touch. This explains why it is that the senses 
<A NAME="516"></A>are liable to err regarding them, while no such error arises respecting 
<A NAME="517"></A>their proper sensibles; e.g. the sense of Seeing is not deceived as to 
<A NAME="518"></A>Colour, nor is that of Hearing as to Sound.
<A NAME="519"></A><BR><BR>On the other hand, they reduce the proper to common sensibles, 
<A NAME="520"></A>as Democritus does with White and Black; for he asserts that the latter 
<A NAME="521"></A>is [a mode of the] rough, and the former [a mode of the] smooth, while 
<A NAME="522"></A>he reduces Savours to the atomic figures. Yet surely no one sense, or, 
<A NAME="523"></A>if any, the sense of Sight rather than any other, can discern the common 
<A NAME="524"></A>sensibles. But if we suppose that the sense of Taste is better able to 
<A NAME="525"></A>do so, then- since to discern the smallest objects in each kind is what 
<A NAME="526"></A>marks the acutest sense-Taste should have been the sense which best perceived 
<A NAME="527"></A>the common sensibles generally, and showed the most perfect power of discerning 
<A NAME="528"></A>figures in general.
<A NAME="529"></A><BR><BR>Again, all the sensibles involve contrariety; e.g. in Colour White 
<A NAME="530"></A>is contrary to Black, and in Savours Bitter is contrary to Sweet; but no 
<A NAME="531"></A>one figure is reckoned as contrary to any other figure. Else, to which 
<A NAME="532"></A>of the possible polygonal figures [to which Democritus reduces Bitter] 
<A NAME="533"></A>is the spherical figure [to which he reduces Sweet] 
<A NAME="534"></A>contrary?
<A NAME="535"></A><BR><BR>Again, since figures are infinite in number, savours also should 
<A NAME="536"></A>be infinite; [the possible rejoinder- 'that they are so, only that some
