<A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A><B>Part 1</B>
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="11"></A>We have now treated, in regard to blooded animals of the parts they have 
<A NAME="12"></A>in common and of the parts peculiar to this genus or that, and of the parts 
<A NAME="13"></A>both composite and simple, whether without or within. We now proceed to 
<A NAME="14"></A>treat of animals devoid of blood. These animals are divided into several 
<A NAME="15"></A>genera.
<A NAME="16"></A><BR><BR>One genus consists of so-called 'molluscs'; and by the term 'mollusc' 
<A NAME="17"></A>we mean an animal that, being devoid of blood, has its flesh-like substance 
<A NAME="18"></A>outside, and any hard structure it may happen to have, inside-in this respect 
<A NAME="19"></A>resembling the red-blooded animals, such as the genus of the 
<A NAME="20"></A>cuttle-fish.
<A NAME="21"></A><BR><BR>Another genus is that of the malacostraca. These are animals that 
<A NAME="22"></A>have their hard structure outside, and their soft or fleshlike substance 
<A NAME="23"></A>inside, and the hard substance belonging to them has to be crushed rather 
<A NAME="24"></A>than shattered; and to this genus belongs the crawfish and the 
<A NAME="25"></A>crab.
<A NAME="26"></A><BR><BR>A third genus is that of the ostracoderms or 'testaceans'. These 
<A NAME="27"></A>are animals that have their hard substance outside and their flesh-like 
<A NAME="28"></A>substance within, and their hard substance can be shattered but not crushed; 
<A NAME="29"></A>and to this genus belong the snail and the oyster.
<A NAME="30"></A><BR><BR>The fourth genus is that of insects; and this genus comprehends 
<A NAME="31"></A>numerous and dissimilar species. Insects are creatures that, as the name 
<A NAME="32"></A>implies, have nicks either on the belly or on the back, or on both belly 
<A NAME="33"></A>and back, and have no one part distinctly osseous and no one part distinctly 
<A NAME="34"></A>fleshy, but are throughout a something intermediate between bone and flesh; 
<A NAME="35"></A>that is to say, their body is hard all through, inside and outside. Some 
<A NAME="36"></A>insects are wingless, such as the iulus and the centipede; some are winged, 
<A NAME="37"></A>as the bee, the cockchafer, and the wasp; and the same kind is in some 
<A NAME="38"></A>cases both winged and wingless, as the ant and the glow-worm.
<A NAME="39"></A><BR><BR>In molluscs the external parts are as follows: in the first place, 
<A NAME="40"></A>the so-called feet; secondly, and attached to these, the head; thirdly, 
<A NAME="41"></A>the mantle-sac, containing the internal parts, and incorrectly designated 
<A NAME="42"></A>by some writers the head; and, fourthly, fins round about the sac. (See 
<A NAME="43"></A>diagram.) In all molluscs the head is found to be between the feet and 
<A NAME="44"></A>the belly. All molluscs are furnished with eight feet, and in all cases 
<A NAME="45"></A>these feet are severally furnished with a double row of suckers, with the 
<A NAME="46"></A>exception of one single species of poulpe or octopus. The sepia, the small 
<A NAME="47"></A>calamary and the large calamary have an exceptional organ in a pair of 
<A NAME="48"></A>long arms or tentacles, having at their extremities a portion rendered 
<A NAME="49"></A>rough by the presence of two rows of suckers; and with these arms or tentacles 
<A NAME="50"></A>they apprehend their food and draw it into their mouths, and in stormy 
<A NAME="51"></A>weather they cling by them to a rock and sway about in the rough water 
<A NAME="52"></A>like ships lying at anchor. They swim by the aid of the fins that they 
<A NAME="53"></A>have about the sac. In all cases their feet are furnished with 
<A NAME="54"></A>suckers.
<A NAME="55"></A><BR><BR>The octopus, by the way, uses his feelers either as feet or hands; 
<A NAME="56"></A>with the two which stand over his mouth he draws in food, and the last 
<A NAME="57"></A>of his feelers he employs in the act of copulation; and this last one, 
<A NAME="58"></A>by the way, is extremely sharp, is exceptional as being of a whitish colour, 
<A NAME="59"></A>and at its extremity is bifurcate; that is to say, it has an additional 
<A NAME="60"></A>something on the rachis, and by rachis is meant the smooth surface or edge 
<A NAME="61"></A>of the arm on the far side from the suckers. (See diagram.)
<A NAME="62"></A><BR><BR>In front of the sac and over the feelers they have a hollow tube, 
<A NAME="63"></A>by means of which they discharge any sea-water that they may have taken 
<A NAME="64"></A>into the sac of the body in the act of receiving food by the mouth. They 
<A NAME="65"></A>can shift the tube from side to side, and by means of it they discharge 
<A NAME="66"></A>the black liquid peculiar to the animal.
<A NAME="67"></A><BR><BR>Stretching out its feet, it swims obliquely in the direction of 
<A NAME="68"></A>the so-called head, and by this mode of swimming it can see in front, for 
<A NAME="69"></A>its eyes are at the top, and in this attitude it has its mouth at the rear. 
<A NAME="70"></A>The 'head', while the creature is alive, is hard, and looks as though it 
<A NAME="71"></A>were inflated. It apprehends and retains objects by means of the under-surface 
<A NAME="72"></A>of its arms, and the membrane in between its feet is kept at full tension; 
<A NAME="73"></A>if the animal get on to the sand it can no longer retain its 
<A NAME="74"></A>hold.
<A NAME="75"></A><BR><BR>There is a difference between the octopus and the other molluscs 
<A NAME="76"></A>above mentioned: the body of the octopus is small, and his feet are long, 
<A NAME="77"></A>whereas in the others the body is large and the feet short; so short, in 
<A NAME="78"></A>fact, that they cannot walk on them. Compared with one another, the teuthis, 
<A NAME="79"></A>or calamary, is long-shaped, and the sepia flat-shaped; and of the calamaries 
<A NAME="80"></A>the so-called teuthus is much bigger than the teuthis; for teuthi have 
<A NAME="81"></A>been found as much as five ells long. Some sepiae attain a length of two 
<A NAME="82"></A>ells, and the feelers of the octopus are sometimes as long, or even longer. 
<A NAME="83"></A>The species teuthus is not a numerous one; the teuthus differs from the 
<A NAME="84"></A>teuthis in shape; that is, the sharp extremity of the teuthus is broader 
<A NAME="85"></A>than that of the other, and, further, the encircling fin goes all round 
<A NAME="86"></A>the trunk, whereas it is in part lacking in the teuthis; both animals are 
<A NAME="87"></A>pelagic.
<A NAME="88"></A><BR><BR>In all cases the head comes after the feet, in the middle of the 
<A NAME="89"></A>feet that are called arms or feelers. There is here situated a mouth, and 
<A NAME="90"></A>two teeth in the mouth; and above these two large eyes, and betwixt the 
<A NAME="91"></A>eyes a small cartilage enclosing a small brain; and within the mouth it 
<A NAME="92"></A>has a minute organ of a fleshy nature, and this it uses as a tongue, for 
<A NAME="93"></A>no other tongue does it possess. Next after this, on the outside, is what 
<A NAME="94"></A>looks like a sac; the flesh of which it is made is divisible, not in long 
<A NAME="95"></A>straight strips, but in annular flakes; and all molluscs have a cuticle 
<A NAME="96"></A>around this flesh. Next after or at the back of the mouth comes a long 
<A NAME="97"></A>and narrow oesophagus, and close after that a crop or craw, large and spherical, 
<A NAME="98"></A>like that of a bird; then comes the stomach, like the fourth stomach in 
<A NAME="99"></A>ruminants; and the shape of it resembles the spiral convolution in the 
<A NAME="100"></A>trumpet-shell; from the stomach there goes back again, in the direction 
<A NAME="101"></A>of the mouth, thin gut, and the gut is thicker than the oesophagus. (See 
<A NAME="102"></A>diagram.)
<A NAME="103"></A><BR><BR>Molluscs have no viscera, but they have what is called a mytis, 
<A NAME="104"></A>and on it a vessel containing a thick black juice; in the sepia or cuttle-fish 
<A NAME="105"></A>this vessel is the largest, and this juice is most abundant. All molluscs, 
<A NAME="106"></A>when frightened, discharge such a juice, but the discharge is most copious 
<A NAME="107"></A>in the cuttle-fish. The mytis, then, is situated under the mouth, and the 
<A NAME="108"></A>oesophagus runs through it; and down below at the point to which the gut 
<A NAME="109"></A>extends is the vesicle of the black juice, and the animal has the vesicle 
<A NAME="110"></A>and the gut enveloped in one and the same membrane, and by the same membrane, 
<A NAME="111"></A>same orifice discharges both the black juice and the residuum. The animals 
<A NAME="112"></A>have also certain hair-like or furry growths in their 
<A NAME="113"></A>bodies.
<A NAME="114"></A><BR><BR>In the sepia, the teuthis, and the teuthus the hard parts are within, 
<A NAME="115"></A>towards the back of the body; those parts are called in one the sepium, 
<A NAME="116"></A>and in the other the 'sword'. They differ from one another, for the sepium 
<A NAME="117"></A>in the cuttle-fish and teuthus is hard and flat, being a substance intermediate 
<A NAME="118"></A>between bone and fishbone, with (in part) a crumbling, spongy texture, 
<A NAME="119"></A>but in the teuthis the part is thin and somewhat gristly. These parts differ 
<A NAME="120"></A>from one another in shape, as do also the bodies of the animals. The octopus 
<A NAME="121"></A>has nothing hard of this kind in its interior, but it has a gristly substance 
<A NAME="122"></A>round the head, which, if the animal grows old, becomes 
<A NAME="123"></A>hard.
<A NAME="124"></A><BR><BR>The females differ from the males. The males have a duct in under 
<A NAME="125"></A>the oesophagus, extending from the mantle-cavity to the lower portion of 
<A NAME="126"></A>the sac, and there is an organ to which it attaches, resembling a breast; 
<A NAME="127"></A>(see diagram) in the female there are two of these organs, situated higher 
<A NAME="128"></A>up; (see diagram) with both sexes there are underneath these organs certain 
<A NAME="129"></A>red formations. The egg of the octopus is single, uneven on its surface, 
<A NAME="130"></A>and of large size; the fluid substance within is all uniform in colour, 
<A NAME="131"></A>smooth, and in colour white; the size of the egg is so great as to fill 
<A NAME="132"></A>a vessel larger than the creature's head. The sepia has two sacs, and inside 
<A NAME="133"></A>them a number of eggs, like in appearance to white hailstones. For the 
<A NAME="134"></A>disposition of these parts I must refer to my anatomical 
<A NAME="135"></A>diagrams.
<A NAME="136"></A><BR><BR>The males of all these animals differ from the females, and the 
<A NAME="137"></A>difference between the sexes is most marked in the sepia; for the back 
<A NAME="138"></A>of the trunk, which is blacker than the belly, is rougher in the male than 
<A NAME="139"></A>in the female, and in the male the back is striped, and the rump is more 
<A NAME="140"></A>sharply pointed.
<A NAME="141"></A><BR><BR>There are several species of the octopus. One keeps close to the 
<A NAME="142"></A>surface, and is the largest of them all, and near the shore the size is 
<A NAME="143"></A>larger than in deep water; and there are others, small, variegated in colour, 
<A NAME="144"></A>which are not articles of food. There are two others, one called the heledone, 
<A NAME="145"></A>which differs from its congeners in the length of its legs and in having 
<A NAME="146"></A>one row of suckers-all the rest of the molluscs having two,-the other nicknamed 
<A NAME="147"></A>variously the bolitaina or the 'onion,' and the ozolis or the 
<A NAME="148"></A>'stinkard'.
<A NAME="149"></A><BR><BR>There are two others found in shells resembling those of the testaceans. 
<A NAME="150"></A>One of them is nicknamed by some persons the nautilus or the pontilus, 
<A NAME="151"></A>or by others the 'polypus' egg'; and the shell of this creature is something 
<A NAME="152"></A>like a separate valve of a deep scallop-shell. This polypus lives very 
<A NAME="153"></A>often near to the shore, and is apt to be thrown up high and dry on the 
<A NAME="154"></A>beach; under these circumstances it is found with its shell detached, and 
<A NAME="155"></A>dies by and by on dry land. These polypods are small, and are shaped, as 
<A NAME="156"></A>regards the form of their bodies, like the bolbidia. There is another polypus 
<A NAME="157"></A>that is placed within a shell like a snail; it never comes out of the shell, 
<A NAME="158"></A>but lives inside the shell like the snail, and from time to time protrudes 
<A NAME="159"></A>its feelers.
<A NAME="160"></A><BR><BR>So much for molluscs.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="161"></A><B>Part 2</B>

<A NAME="162"></A><BR><BR>With regard to the Malacostraca or crustaceans, one species is 
<A NAME="163"></A>that of the crawfish, and a second, resembling the first, is that of the 
<A NAME="164"></A>lobster; the lobster differing from the crawfish in having claws, and in 
<A NAME="165"></A>a few other respects as well. Another species is that of the carid, and 
<A NAME="166"></A>another is that of the crab, and there are many kinds both of carid and 
<A NAME="167"></A>of crab.
<A NAME="168"></A><BR><BR>Of carids there are the so-called cyphae, or 'hunch-backs', the 
<A NAME="169"></A>crangons, or squillae, and the little kind, or shrimps, and the little 
<A NAME="170"></A>kind do not develop into a larger kind.
<A NAME="171"></A><BR><BR>Of the crab, the varieties are indefinite and incalculable. The 
<A NAME="172"></A>largest of all crabs is one nicknamed Maia, a second variety is the pagarus 
<A NAME="173"></A>and the crab of Heracleotis, and a third variety is the fresh-water crab; 
<A NAME="174"></A>the other varieties are smaller in size and destitute of special designations. 
<A NAME="175"></A>In the neighbourhood of Phoenice there are found on the beach certain crabs 
<A NAME="176"></A>that are nicknamed the 'horsemen', from their running with such speed that 
<A NAME="177"></A>it is difficult to overtake them; these crabs, when opened, are usually 
<A NAME="178"></A>found empty, and this emptiness may be put down to insufficiency of nutriment. 
<A NAME="179"></A>(There is another variety, small like the crab, but resembling in shape 
<A NAME="180"></A>the lobster.) All these animals, as has been stated, have their hard and 
<A NAME="181"></A>shelly part outside, where the skin is in other animals, and the fleshy 
<A NAME="182"></A>part inside; and the belly is more or less provided with lamellae, or little 
<A NAME="183"></A>flaps, and the female here deposits her spawn.
<A NAME="184"></A><BR><BR>The crawfishes have five feet on either side, including the claws 
<A NAME="185"></A>at the end; and in like manner the crabs have ten feet in all, including 
<A NAME="186"></A>the claws. Of the carids, the hunch-backed, or prawns, have five feet on 
<A NAME="187"></A>either side, which are sharp-pointed-those towards the head; and five others 
<A NAME="188"></A>on either side in the region of the belly, with their extremities flat; 
<A NAME="189"></A>they are devoid of flaps on the under side such as the crawfish has, but 
<A NAME="190"></A>on the back they resemble the crawfish. (See diagram.)It is very different 
<A NAME="191"></A>with the crangon, or squilla; it has four front legs on either side, then 
<A NAME="192"></A>three thin ones close behind on either side, and the rest of the body is 
<A NAME="193"></A>for the most part devoid of feet. (See diagram.) Of all these animals the 
<A NAME="194"></A>feet bend out obliquely, as is the case with insects; and the claws, where 
<A NAME="195"></A>claws are found, turn inwards. The crawfish has a tail, and five fins on 
<A NAME="196"></A>it; and the round-backed carid has a tail and four fins; the squilla also 
<A NAME="197"></A>has fins at the tail on either side. In the case of both the hump-backed 
<A NAME="198"></A>carid and the squilla the middle art of the tail is spinous: only that 
<A NAME="199"></A>in the squilla the part is flattened and in the carid it is sharp-pointed. 
<A NAME="200"></A>Of all animals of this genus the crab is the only one devoid of a rump; 
<A NAME="201"></A>and, while the body of the carid and the crawfish is elongated, that of 
<A NAME="202"></A>the crab is rotund.
<A NAME="203"></A><BR><BR>In the crawfish the male differs from the female: in the female 
<A NAME="204"></A>the first foot is bifurcate, in the male it is undivided; the belly-fins 
<A NAME="205"></A>in the female are large and overlapping on the neck, while in the male 
<A NAME="206"></A>they are smaller and do not overlap; and, further, on the last feet of 
<A NAME="207"></A>the male there are spur-like projections, large and sharp, which projections 
<A NAME="208"></A>in the female are small and smooth. Both male and female have two antennae 
<A NAME="209"></A>in front of the eyes, large and rough, and other antennae underneath, small 
<A NAME="210"></A>and smooth. The eyes of all these creatures are hard and beady, and can 
<A NAME="211"></A>move either to the inner or to the outer side. The eyes of most crabs have 
<A NAME="212"></A>a similar facility of movement, or rather, in the crab this facility is 
<A NAME="213"></A>developed in a higher degree. (See diagram.)
<A NAME="214"></A><BR><BR>The lobster is all over grey-coloured, with a mottling of black. 
<A NAME="215"></A>Its under or hinder feet, up to the big feet or claws, are eight in number; 
<A NAME="216"></A>then come the big feet, far larger and flatter at the tips than the same 
<A NAME="217"></A>organs in the crawfish; and these big feet or claws are exceptional in 
<A NAME="218"></A>their structure, for the right claw has the extreme flat surface long and 
<A NAME="219"></A>thin, while the left claw has the corresponding surface thick and round. 
<A NAME="220"></A>Each of the two claws, divided at the end like a pair of jaws, has both 
<A NAME="221"></A>below and above a set of teeth: only that in the right claw they are all 
<A NAME="222"></A>small and saw-shaped, while in the left claw those at the apex are saw-shaped 
<A NAME="223"></A>and those within are molar-shaped, these latter being, in the under part 
<A NAME="224"></A>of the cleft claw, four teeth close together, and in the upper part three 
<A NAME="225"></A>teeth, not close together. Both right and left claws have the upper part 
<A NAME="226"></A>mobile, and bring it to bear against the lower one, and both are curved 
<A NAME="227"></A>like bandy-legs, being thereby adapted for apprehension and constriction. 
<A NAME="228"></A>Above the two large claws come two others, covered with hair, a little 
<A NAME="229"></A>underneath the mouth; and underneath these the gill-like formations in 
<A NAME="230"></A>the region of the mouth, hairy and numerous. These organs the animal keeps 
<A NAME="231"></A>in perpetual motion; and the two hairy feet it bends and draws in towards 
<A NAME="232"></A>its mouth. The feet near the mouth are furnished also with delicate outgrowing 
<A NAME="233"></A>appendages. Like the crawfish, the lobster has two teeth, or mandibles, 
<A NAME="234"></A>and above these teeth are its antennae, long, but shorter and finer by 
<A NAME="235"></A>far than those of the crawfish, and then four other antennae similar in 
<A NAME="236"></A>shape, but shorter and finer than the others. Over these antennae come 
<A NAME="237"></A>the eyes, small and short, not large like the eyes of the crawfish. Over 
<A NAME="238"></A>the eyes is a peaky rough projection like a forehead, larger than the same 
<A NAME="239"></A>part in the crawfish; in fact, the frontal part is more pointed and the 
<A NAME="240"></A>thorax is much broader in the lobster than in the crawfish, and the body 
<A NAME="241"></A>in general is smoother and more full of flesh. Of the eight feet, four 
<A NAME="242"></A>are bifurcate at the extremities, and four are undivided. The region of 
<A NAME="243"></A>the so-called neck is outwardly divided into five divisions, and sixthly 
<A NAME="244"></A>comes the flattened portion at the end, and this portion has five flaps, 
<A NAME="245"></A>or tail-fins; and the inner or under parts, into which the female drops 
<A NAME="246"></A>her spawn, are four in number and hairy, and on each of the aforesaid parts 
<A NAME="247"></A>is a spine turned outwards, short and straight. The body in general and 
<A NAME="248"></A>the region of the thorax in particular are smooth, not rough as in the 
<A NAME="249"></A>crawfish; but on the large claws the outer portion has larger spines. There 
<A NAME="250"></A>is no apparent difference between the male and female, for they both have 
<A NAME="251"></A>one claw, whichever it may be, larger than the other, and neither male 
<A NAME="252"></A>nor female is ever found with both claws of the same 
<A NAME="253"></A>size.
<A NAME="254"></A><BR><BR>All crustaceans take in water close by the mouth. The crab discharges 
<A NAME="255"></A>it, closing up, as it does so, a small portion of the same, and the crawfish 
<A NAME="256"></A>discharges it by way of the gills; and, by the way, the gill-shaped organs 
<A NAME="257"></A>in the crawfish are very numerous.
<A NAME="258"></A><BR><BR>The following properties are common to all crustaceans: they have 
<A NAME="259"></A>in all cases two teeth, or mandibles (for the front teeth in the crawfish 
<A NAME="260"></A>are two in number), and in all cases there is in the mouth a small fleshy 
<A NAME="261"></A>structure serving for a tongue; and the stomach is close to the mouth, 
<A NAME="262"></A>only that the crawfish has a little oesophagus in front of the stomach, 
<A NAME="263"></A>and there is a straight gut attached to it. This gut, in the crawfish and 
<A NAME="264"></A>its congeners, and in the carids, extends in a straight line to the tail, 
<A NAME="265"></A>and terminates where the animal discharges the residuum, and where the 
<A NAME="266"></A>female deposits her spawn; in the crab it terminates where the flap is 
<A NAME="267"></A>situated, and in the centre of the flap. (And by the way, in all these 
<A NAME="268"></A>animals the spawn is deposited outside.) Further, the female has the place 
<A NAME="269"></A>for the spawn running along the gut. And, again, all these animals have, 
<A NAME="270"></A>more or less, an organ termed the 'mytis', or 'poppyjuice'.
<A NAME="271"></A><BR><BR>We must now proceed to review their several 
<A NAME="272"></A>differentiae.
<A NAME="273"></A><BR>The crawfish then, as has been said, has two teeth, large and hollow, 
<A NAME="274"></A>in which is contained a juice resembling the mytis, and in between the 
<A NAME="275"></A>teeth is a fleshy substance, shaped like a tongue. After the mouth comes 
<A NAME="276"></A>a short oesophagus, and then a membranous stomach attached to the oesophagus, 
<A NAME="277"></A>and at the orifice Of the stomach are three teeth, two facing one another 
<A NAME="278"></A>and a third standing by itself underneath. Coming off at a bend from the 
<A NAME="279"></A>stomach is a gut, simple and of equal thickness throughout the entire length 
<A NAME="280"></A>of the body until it reaches the anal vent.
<A NAME="281"></A><BR><BR>These are all common properties of the crawfish, the carid, and 
<A NAME="282"></A>the crab; for the crab, be it remembered, has two teeth.
<A NAME="283"></A><BR><BR>Again, the crawfish has a duct attached all the way from the chest 
<A NAME="284"></A>to the anal vent; and this duct is connected with the ovary in the female, 
<A NAME="285"></A>and with the seminal ducts in the male. This passage is attached to the 
<A NAME="286"></A>concave surface of the flesh in such a way that the flesh is in betwixt 
<A NAME="287"></A>the duct and the gut; for the gut is related to the convexity and this 
<A NAME="288"></A>duct to the concavity, pretty much as is observed in quadrupeds. And the 
<A NAME="289"></A>duct is identical in both the sexes; that is to say, the duct in both is 
<A NAME="290"></A>thin and white, and charged with a sallow-coloured moisture, and is attached 
<A NAME="291"></A>to the chest.
<A NAME="292"></A><BR><BR>(The following are the properties of the egg and of the convolutes 
<A NAME="293"></A>in the carid.)
<A NAME="294"></A><BR><BR>The male, by the way, differs from the female in regard to its 
<A NAME="295"></A>flesh, in having in connexion with the chest two separate and distinct 
<A NAME="296"></A>white substances, resembling in colour and conformation the tentacles of 
<A NAME="297"></A>the cuttle-fish, and they are convoluted like the 'poppy' or quasi-liver 
<A NAME="298"></A>of the trumpet-shell. These organs have their starting-point in 'cotyledons' 
<A NAME="299"></A>or papillae, which are situated under the hindmost feet; and hereabouts 
<A NAME="300"></A>the flesh is red and blood-coloured, but is slippery to the touch and in 
<A NAME="301"></A>so far unlike flesh. Off from the convolute organ at the chest branches 
<A NAME="302"></A>off another coil about as thick as ordinary twine; and underneath there 
<A NAME="303"></A>are two granular seminal bodies in juxta-position with the gut. These are 
<A NAME="304"></A>the organs of the male. The female has red-coloured eggs, which are adjacent 
<A NAME="305"></A>to the stomach and to each side of the gut all along to the fleshy parts, 
<A NAME="306"></A>being enveloped in a thin membrane.
<A NAME="307"></A><BR><BR>Such are the parts, internal and external, of the 
<A NAME="308"></A>carid.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="309"></A><B>Part 3</B>

<A NAME="310"></A><BR><BR>The inner organs of sanguineous animals happen to have specific 
<A NAME="311"></A>designations; for these animals have in all cases the inner viscera, but 
<A NAME="312"></A>this is not the case with the bloodless animals, but what they have in 
<A NAME="313"></A>common with red-blooded animals is the stomach, the oesophagus, and the 
<A NAME="314"></A>gut.
<A NAME="315"></A><BR><BR>With regard to the crab, it has already been stated that it has 
<A NAME="316"></A>claws and feet, and their position has been set forth; furthermore, for 
<A NAME="317"></A>the most part they have the right claw bigger and stronger than the left. 
<A NAME="318"></A>It has also been stated' that in general the eyes of the crab look sideways. 
<A NAME="319"></A>Further, the trunk of the crab's body is single and undivided, including 
<A NAME="320"></A>its head and any other part it may possess. Some crabs have eyes placed 
<A NAME="321"></A>sideways on the upper part, immediately under the back, and standing a 
<A NAME="322"></A>long way apart, and some have their eyes in the centre and close together, 
<A NAME="323"></A>like the crabs of Heracleotis and the so-called 'grannies'. The mouth lies 
<A NAME="324"></A>underneath the eyes, and inside it there are two teeth, as is the case 
<A NAME="325"></A>with the crawfish, only that in the crab the teeth are not rounded but 
<A NAME="326"></A>long; and over the teeth are two lids, and in betwixt them are structures 
<A NAME="327"></A>such as the crawfish has besides its teeth. The crab takes in water near 
<A NAME="328"></A>by the mouth, using the lids as a check to the inflow, and discharges the 
<A NAME="329"></A>water by two passages above the mouth, closing by means of the lids the 
<A NAME="330"></A>way by which it entered; and the two passage-ways are underneath the eyes. 
<A NAME="331"></A>When it has taken in water it closes its mouth by means of both lids, and 
<A NAME="332"></A>ejects the water in the way above described. Next after the teeth comes 
<A NAME="333"></A>the oesophagus, very short, so short in fact that the stomach seems to 
<A NAME="334"></A>come straightway after the mouth. Next after the oesophagus comes the stomach, 
<A NAME="335"></A>two-horned, to the centre of which is attached a simple and delicate gut; 
<A NAME="336"></A>and the gut terminates outwards, at the operculum, as has been previously 
<A NAME="337"></A>stated. (The crab has the parts in between the lids in the neighbourhood 
<A NAME="338"></A>of the teeth similar to the same parts in the crawfish.) Inside the trunk 
<A NAME="339"></A>is a sallow juice and some few little bodies, long and white, and others 
<A NAME="340"></A>spotted red. The male differs from the female in size and breadth, and 
<A NAME="341"></A>in respect of the ventral flap; for this is larger in the female than in 
<A NAME="342"></A>the male, and stands out further from the trunk, and is more hairy (as 
<A NAME="343"></A>is the case also with the female in the crawfish).
<A NAME="344"></A><BR><BR>So much, then, for the organs of the malacostraca or 
<A NAME="345"></A>crustacea.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="346"></A><B>Part 4</B>

<A NAME="347"></A><BR><BR>With the ostracoderma, or testaceans, such as the land-snails and 
<A NAME="348"></A>the sea-snails, and all the 'oysters' so-called, and also with the sea-urchin 
<A NAME="349"></A>genus, the fleshy part, in such as have flesh, is similarly situated to 
<A NAME="350"></A>the fleshy part in the crustaceans; in other words, it is inside the animal, 
<A NAME="351"></A>and the shell is outside, and there is no hard substance in the interior. 
<A NAME="352"></A>As compared with one another the testaceans present many diversities both 
<A NAME="353"></A>in regard to their shells and to the flesh within. Some of them have no 
<A NAME="354"></A>flesh at all, as the sea-urchin; others have flesh, but it is inside and 
<A NAME="355"></A>wholly hidden, except the head, as in the land-snails, and the so-called 
<A NAME="356"></A>cocalia, and, among pelagic animals, in the purple murex, the ceryx or 
<A NAME="357"></A>trumpet-shell, the sea-snail, and the spiral-shaped testaceans in general. 
<A NAME="358"></A>Of the rest, some are bivalved and some univalved; and by 'bivalves' I 
<A NAME="359"></A>mean such as are enclosed within two shells, and by 'univalved' such as 
<A NAME="360"></A>are enclosed within a single shell, and in these last the fleshy part is 
<A NAME="361"></A>exposed, as in the case of the limpet. Of the bivalves, some can open out, 
<A NAME="362"></A>like the scallop and the mussel; for all such shells are grown together 
<A NAME="363"></A>on one side and are separate on the other, so as to open and shut. Other 
<A NAME="364"></A>bivalves are closed on both sides alike, like the solen or razor-fish. 
<A NAME="365"></A>Some testaceans there are, that are entirely enveloped in shell and expose 
<A NAME="366"></A>no portion of their flesh outside, as the tethya or 
<A NAME="367"></A>ascidians.
<A NAME="368"></A><BR><BR>Again, in regard to the shells themselves, the testaceans present 
<A NAME="369"></A>differences when compared with one another. Some are smooth-shelled, like 
<A NAME="370"></A>the solen, the mussel, and some clams, viz. those that are nicknamed 'milkshells', 
<A NAME="371"></A>while others are rough-shelled, such as the pool-oyster or edible oyster, 
<A NAME="372"></A>the pinna, and certain species of cockles, and the trumpet shells; and 
<A NAME="373"></A>of these some are ribbed, such as the scallop and a certain kind of clam 
<A NAME="374"></A>or cockle, and some are devoid of ribs, as the pinna and another species 
<A NAME="375"></A>of clam. Testaceans also differ from one another in regard to the thickness 
<A NAME="376"></A>or thinness of their shell, both as regards the shell in its entirety and 
<A NAME="377"></A>as regards specific parts of the shell, for instance, the lips; for some 
<A NAME="378"></A>have thin-lipped shells, like the mussel, and others have thick-lipped 
<A NAME="379"></A>shells, like the oyster. A property common to the above mentioned, and, 
<A NAME="380"></A>in fact, to all testaceans, is the smoothness of their shells inside. Some 
<A NAME="381"></A>also are capable of motion, like the scallop, and indeed some aver that 
<A NAME="382"></A>scallops can actually fly, owing to the circumstance that they often jump 
<A NAME="383"></A>right out of the apparatus by means of which they are caught; others are 
<A NAME="384"></A>incapable of motion and are attached fast to some external object, as is 
<A NAME="385"></A>the case with the pinna. All the spiral-shaped testaceans can move and 
<A NAME="386"></A>creep, and even the limpet relaxes its hold to go in quest of food. In 
<A NAME="387"></A>the case of the univalves and the bivalves, the fleshy substance adheres 
<A NAME="388"></A>to the shell so tenaciously that it can only be removed by an effort; in 
<A NAME="389"></A>the case of the stromboids, it is more loosely attached. And a peculiarity 
<A NAME="390"></A>of all the stromboids is the spiral twist of the shell in the part farthest 
<A NAME="391"></A>away from the head; they are also furnished from birth with an operculum. 
<A NAME="392"></A>And, further, all stromboid testaceans have their shells on the right hand 
<A NAME="393"></A>side, and move not in the direction of the spire, but the opposite way. 
<A NAME="394"></A>Such are the diversities observed in the external parts of these 
<A NAME="395"></A>animals.
<A NAME="396"></A><BR><BR>The internal structure is almost the same in all these creatures, 
<A NAME="397"></A>and in the stromboids especially; for it is in size that these latter differ 
<A NAME="398"></A>from one another, and in accidents of the nature of excess or defect. And 
<A NAME="399"></A>there is not much difference between most of the univalves and bivalves; 
<A NAME="400"></A>but, while those that open and shut differ from one another but slightly, 
<A NAME="401"></A>they differ considerably from such as are incapable of motion. And this 
<A NAME="402"></A>will be illustrated more satisfactorily hereafter.
<A NAME="403"></A><BR><BR>The spiral-shaped testaceans are all similarly constructed, but 
<A NAME="404"></A>differ from one another, as has been said, in the way of excess or defect 
<A NAME="405"></A>(for the larger species have larger and more conspicuous organs, and the 
<A NAME="406"></A>smaller have smaller and less conspicuous), and, furthermore, in relative 
<A NAME="407"></A>hardness or softness, and in other such accidents or properties. All the 
<A NAME="408"></A>stromboids, for instance, have the flesh that extrudes from the mouth of 
<A NAME="409"></A>the shell, hard and stiff; some more, and some less. From the middle of 
<A NAME="410"></A>this protrudes the head and two horns, and these horns are large in the 
<A NAME="411"></A>large species, but exceedingly minute in the smaller ones. The head protrudes 
<A NAME="412"></A>from them all in the same way; and, if the animal be alarmed, the head 
<A NAME="413"></A>draws in again. Some of these creatures have a mouth and teeth, as the 
<A NAME="414"></A>snail; teeth sharp, and small, and delicate. They have also a proboscis 
<A NAME="415"></A>just like that of the fly; and the proboscis is tongue-shaped. The ceryx 
<A NAME="416"></A>and the purple murex have this organ firm and solid; and just as the myops, 
<A NAME="417"></A>or horse-fly, and the oestrus, or gadfly, can pierce the skin of a quadruped, 
<A NAME="418"></A>so is that proboscis proportionately stronger in these testaceans; for 
<A NAME="419"></A>they bore right through the shells of other shell-fish on which they prey. 
<A NAME="420"></A>The stomach follows close upon the mouth, and, by the way, this organ in 
<A NAME="421"></A>the snail resembles a bird's crop. Underneath come two white firm formations, 
<A NAME="422"></A>mastoid or papillary in form; and similar formations are found in the cuttle-fish 
<A NAME="423"></A>also, only that they are of a firmer consistency in the cuttle-fish. After 
<A NAME="424"></A>the stomach comes an oesophagus, simple and long, extending to the poppy 
<A NAME="425"></A>or quasi-liver, which is in the innermost recess of the shell. All these 
<A NAME="426"></A>statements may be verified in the case of the purple murex and the ceryx 
<A NAME="427"></A>by observation within the whorl of the shell. What comes next to the oesophagus 
<A NAME="428"></A>is the gut; in fact, the gut is continuous with the oesophagus, and runs 
<A NAME="429"></A>its whole length uncomplicated to the outlet of the residuum. The gut has 
<A NAME="430"></A>its point of origin in the region of the coil of the mecon, or so-called 
<A NAME="431"></A>'poppy', and is wider hereabouts (for remember, the mecon is for the most 
<A NAME="432"></A>part a sort of excretion in all testaceans); it then takes a bend and runs 
<A NAME="433"></A>up again towards the fleshy part, and terminates by the side of the head, 
<A NAME="434"></A>where the animal discharges its residuum; and this holds good in the case 
<A NAME="435"></A>of all stromboid testaceans, whether terrestrial or marine. From the stomach 
<A NAME="436"></A>there is drawn in a parallel direction with the oesophagus, in the larger 
<A NAME="437"></A>snails, a long white duct enveloped in a membrane, resembling in colour 
<A NAME="438"></A>the mastoid formations higher up; and in it are nicks or interruptions, 
<A NAME="439"></A>as in the egg-mass of the crawfish, only, by the way, the duct of which 
<A NAME="440"></A>we are treating is white and the egg-mass of the crawfish is red. This 
<A NAME="441"></A>formation has no outlet nor duct, but is enveloped in a thin membrane with 
<A NAME="442"></A>a narrow cavity in its interior. And from the gut downward extend black 
<A NAME="443"></A>and rough formations, in close connexion, something like the formations 
<A NAME="444"></A>in the tortoise, only not so black. Marine snails, also, have these formations, 
<A NAME="445"></A>and the white ones, only that the formations are smaller in the smaller 
<A NAME="446"></A>species.
<A NAME="447"></A><BR><BR>The non-spiral univalves and bivalves are in some respect similar 
<A NAME="448"></A>in construction, and in some respects dissimilar, to the spiral testaceans. 
<A NAME="449"></A>They all have a head and horns, and a mouth, and the organ resembling a 
<A NAME="450"></A>tongue; but these organs, in the smaller species, are indiscernible owing 
<A NAME="451"></A>to the minuteness of these animals, and some are indiscernible even in 
<A NAME="452"></A>the larger species when dead, or when at rest and motionless. They all 
<A NAME="453"></A>have the mecon, or poppy, but not all in the same place, nor of equal size, 
<A NAME="454"></A>nor similarly open to observation; thus, the limpets have this organ deep 
<A NAME="455"></A>down in the bottom of the shell, and the bivalves at the hinge connecting 
<A NAME="456"></A>the two valves. They also have in all cases the hairy growths or beards, 
<A NAME="457"></A>in a circular form, as in the scallops. And, with regard to the so-called 
<A NAME="458"></A>'egg', in those that have it, when they have it, it is situated in one 
<A NAME="459"></A>of the semi-circles of the periphery, as is the case with the white formation 
<A NAME="460"></A>in the snail; for this white formation in the snail corresponds to the 
<A NAME="461"></A>so-called egg of which we are speaking. But all these organs, as has been 
<A NAME="462"></A>stated, are distinctly traceable in the larger species, while in the small 
<A NAME="463"></A>ones they are in some cases almost, and in others altogether, indiscernible. 
<A NAME="464"></A>Hence they are most plainly visible in the large scallops; and these are 
<A NAME="465"></A>the bivalves that have one valve flat-shaped, like the lid of a pot. The 
<A NAME="466"></A>outlet of the excretion is in all these animals (save for the exception 
<A NAME="467"></A>to be afterwards related) on one side; for there is a passage whereby the 
<A NAME="468"></A>excretion passes out. (And, remember, the mecon or poppy, as has been stated, 
<A NAME="469"></A>is an excretion in all these animals-an excretion enveloped in a membrane.) 
<A NAME="470"></A>The so-called egg has no outlet in any of these creatures, but is merely 
<A NAME="471"></A>an excrescence in the fleshy mass; and it is not situated in the same region 
<A NAME="472"></A>with the gut, but the 'egg' is situated on the right-hand side and the 
<A NAME="473"></A>gut on the left. Such are the relations of the anal vent in most of these 
<A NAME="474"></A>animals; but in the case of the wild limpet (called by some the 'sea-ear'), 
<A NAME="475"></A>the residuum issues beneath the shell, for the shell is perforated to give 
<A NAME="476"></A>an outlet. In this particular limpet the stomach is seen coming after the 
<A NAME="477"></A>mouth, and the egg-shaped formations are discernible. But for the relative 
<A NAME="478"></A>positions of these parts you are referred to my Treatise on 
<A NAME="479"></A>Anatomy.
<A NAME="480"></A><BR><BR>The so-called carcinium or hermit crab is in a way intermediate 
<A NAME="481"></A>between the crustaceans and the testaceans. In its nature it resembles 
<A NAME="482"></A>the crawfish kind, and it is born simple of itself, but by its habit of 
<A NAME="483"></A>introducing itself into a shell and living there it resembles the testaceans, 
<A NAME="484"></A>and so appears to partake of the characters of both kinds. In shape, to 
<A NAME="485"></A>give a simple illustration, it resembles a spider, only that the part below 
<A NAME="486"></A>the head and thorax is larger in this creature than in the spider. It has 
<A NAME="487"></A>two thin red horns, and underneath these horns two long eyes, not retreating 
<A NAME="488"></A>inwards, nor turning sideways like the eyes of the crab, but protruding 
<A NAME="489"></A>straight out; and underneath these eyes the mouth, and round about the 
<A NAME="490"></A>mouth several hair-like growths, and next after these two bifurcate legs 
<A NAME="491"></A>or claws, whereby it draws in objects towards itself, and two other legs 
<A NAME="492"></A>on either side, and a third small one. All below the thorax is soft, and 
<A NAME="493"></A>when opened in dissection is found to be sallow-coloured within. From the 
<A NAME="494"></A>mouth there runs a single passage right on to the stomach, but the passage 
<A NAME="495"></A>for the excretions is not discernible. The legs and the thorax are hard, 
<A NAME="496"></A>but not so hard as the legs and the thorax of the crab. It does not adhere 
<A NAME="497"></A>to its shell like the purple murex and the ceryx, but can easily slip out 
<A NAME="498"></A>of it. It is longer when found in the shell of the stromboids than when 
<A NAME="499"></A>found in the shell of the neritae.
<A NAME="500"></A><BR><BR>And, by the way, the animal found in the shell of the neritae is 
<A NAME="501"></A>a separate species, like to the other in most respects; but of its bifurcate 
<A NAME="502"></A>feet or claws, the right-hand one is small and the left-hand one is large, 
<A NAME="503"></A>and it progresses chiefly by the aid of this latter and larger one. (In 
<A NAME="504"></A>the shells of these animals, and in certain others, there is found a parasite 
<A NAME="505"></A>whose mode of attachment is similar. The particular one which we have just 
<A NAME="506"></A>described is named the cyllarus.)
<A NAME="507"></A><BR><BR>The nerites has a smooth large round shell, and resembles the ceryx 
<A NAME="508"></A>in shape, only the poppy-juice is, in its case, not black but red. It clings 
<A NAME="509"></A>with great force near the middle. In calm weather, then, they go free afield, 
<A NAME="510"></A>but when the wind blows the carcinia take shelter against the rocks: the 
<A NAME="511"></A>neritae themselves cling fast like limpets; and the same is the case with 
<A NAME="512"></A>the haemorrhoid or aporrhaid and all others of the like kind. And, by the 
<A NAME="513"></A>way, they cling to the rock, when they turn back their operculum, for this 
<A NAME="514"></A>operculum seems like a lid; in fact this structure represents the one part, 
<A NAME="515"></A>in the stromboids, of that which in the bivalves is a duplicate shell. 
<A NAME="516"></A>The interior of the animal is fleshy, and the mouth is inside. And it is 
<A NAME="517"></A>the same with the haemorrhoid, the purple murex, and all suchlike 
<A NAME="518"></A>animals.
<A NAME="519"></A><BR><BR>Such of the little crabs as have the left foot or claw the bigger 
<A NAME="520"></A>of the two are found in the neritae, but not in the stromboids. are some 
<A NAME="521"></A>snail-shells which have inside them creatures resembling those little crayfish 
<A NAME="522"></A>that are also found in fresh water. These creatures, however, differ in 
<A NAME="523"></A>having the part inside the shells But as to the characters, you are referred 
<A NAME="524"></A>to my Treatise on Anatomy.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="525"></A><B>Part 5</B>

<A NAME="526"></A><BR><BR>The urchins are devoid of flesh, and this is a character peculiar 
<A NAME="527"></A>to them; and while they are in all cases empty and devoid of any flesh 
<A NAME="528"></A>within, they are in all cases furnished with the black formations. There 
<A NAME="529"></A>are several species of the urchin, and one of these is that which is made 
<A NAME="530"></A>use of for food; this is the kind in which are found the so-called eggs, 
<A NAME="531"></A>large and edible, in the larger and smaller specimens alike; for even when 
<A NAME="532"></A>as yet very small they are provided with them. There are two other species, 
<A NAME="533"></A>the spatangus, and the so-called bryssus, these animals are pelagic and 
<A NAME="534"></A>scarce. Further, there are the echinometrae, or 'mother-urchins', the largest 
<A NAME="535"></A>in size of all the species. In addition to these there is another species, 
<A NAME="536"></A>small in size, but furnished with large hard spines; it lives in the sea 
<A NAME="537"></A>at a depth of several fathoms; and is used by some people as a specific 
<A NAME="538"></A>for cases of strangury. In the neighbourhood of Torone there are sea-urchins 
<A NAME="539"></A>of a white colour, shells, spines, eggs and all, and that are longer than 
<A NAME="540"></A>the ordinary sea-urchin. The spine in this species is not large nor strong, 
<A NAME="541"></A>but rather limp; and the black formations in connexion with the mouth are 
<A NAME="542"></A>more than usually numerous, and communicate with the external duct, but 
<A NAME="543"></A>not with one another; in point of fact, the animal is in a manner divided 
<A NAME="544"></A>up by them. The edible urchin moves with greatest freedom and most often; 
<A NAME="545"></A>and this is indicated by the fact that these urchins have always something 
<A NAME="546"></A>or other on their spines.
<A NAME="547"></A><BR><BR>All urchins are supplied with eggs, but in some of the species 
<A NAME="548"></A>the eggs are exceedingly small and unfit for food. Singularly enough, the 
<A NAME="549"></A>urchin has what we may call its head and mouth down below, and a place 
<A NAME="550"></A>for the issue of the residuum up above; (and this same property is common 
<A NAME="551"></A>to all stromboids and to limpets). For the food on which the creature lives 
<A NAME="552"></A>lies down below; consequently the mouth has a position well adapted for 
<A NAME="553"></A>getting at the food, and the excretion is above, near to the back of the 
<A NAME="554"></A>shell. The urchin has, also, five hollow teeth inside, and in the middle 
<A NAME="555"></A>of these teeth a fleshy substance serving the office of a tongue. Next 
<A NAME="556"></A>to this comes the oesophagus, and then the stomach, divided into five parts, 
<A NAME="557"></A>and filled with excretion, all the five parts uniting at the anal vent, 
<A NAME="558"></A>where the shell is perforated for an outlet. Underneath the stomach, in 
<A NAME="559"></A>another membrane, are the so-called eggs, identical in number in all cases, 
<A NAME="560"></A>and that number is always an odd number, to wit five. Up above, the black 
<A NAME="561"></A>formations are attached to the starting-point of the teeth, and they are 
<A NAME="562"></A>bitter to the taste, and unfit for food. A similar or at least an analogous 
<A NAME="563"></A>formation is found in many animals; as, for instance, in the tortoise, 
<A NAME="564"></A>the toad, the frog, the stromboids, and, generally, in the molluscs; but 
<A NAME="565"></A>the formation varies here and there in colour, and in all cases is altogether 
<A NAME="566"></A>uneatable, or more or less unpalatable. In reality the mouth-apparatus 
<A NAME="567"></A>of the urchin is continuous from one end to the other, but to outward appearance 
<A NAME="568"></A>it is not so, but looks like a horn lantern with the panes of horn left 
<A NAME="569"></A>out. The urchin uses its spines as feet; for it rests its weight on these, 
<A NAME="570"></A>and then moving shifts from place to place.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="571"></A><B>Part 6</B>

<A NAME="572"></A><BR><BR>The so-called tethyum or ascidian has of all these animals the 
<A NAME="573"></A>most remarkable characteristics. It is the only mollusc that has its entire 
<A NAME="574"></A>body concealed within its shell, and the shell is a substance intermediate 
<A NAME="575"></A>between hide and shell, so that it cuts like a piece of hard leather. It 
<A NAME="576"></A>is attached to rocks by its shell, and is provided with two passages placed 
<A NAME="577"></A>at a distance from one another, very minute and hard to see, whereby it 
<A NAME="578"></A>admits and discharges the sea-water; for it has no visible excretion (whereas 
<A NAME="579"></A>of shell fish in general some resemble the urchin in this matter of excretion, 
<A NAME="580"></A>and others are provided with the so-called mecon, or poppy-juice). If the 
<A NAME="581"></A>animal be opened, it is found to have, in the first place, a tendinous 
<A NAME="582"></A>membrane running round inside the shell-like substance, and within this 
<A NAME="583"></A>membrane is the flesh-like substance of the ascidian, not resembling that 
<A NAME="584"></A>in other molluscs; but this flesh, to which I now allude, is the same in 
<A NAME="585"></A>all ascidia. And this substance is attached in two places to the membrane 
<A NAME="586"></A>and the skin, obliquely; and at the point of attachment the space is narrowed 
<A NAME="587"></A>from side to side, where the fleshy substance stretches towards the passages 
<A NAME="588"></A>that lead outwards through the shell; and here it discharges and admits 
<A NAME="589"></A>food and liquid matter, just as it would if one of the passages were a 
<A NAME="590"></A>mouth and the other an anal vent; and one of the passages is somewhat wider 
<A NAME="591"></A>than the other Inside it has a pair of cavities, one on either side, a 
<A NAME="592"></A>small partition separating them; and one of these two cavities contains 
<A NAME="593"></A>the liquid. The creature has no other organ whether motor or sensory, nor, 
<A NAME="594"></A>as was said in the case of the others, is it furnished with any organ connected 
<A NAME="595"></A>with excretion, as other shell-fish are. The colour of the ascidian is 
<A NAME="596"></A>in some cases sallow, and in other cases red.
<A NAME="597"></A><BR><BR>There is, furthermore, the genus of the sea-nettles, peculiar in 
<A NAME="598"></A>its way. The sea-nettle, or sea-anemone, clings to rocks like certain of 
<A NAME="599"></A>the testaceans, but at times relaxes its hold. It has no shell, but its 
<A NAME="600"></A>entire body is fleshy. It is sensitive to touch, and, if you put your hand 
<A NAME="601"></A>to it, it will seize and cling to it, as the cuttlefish would do with its 
<A NAME="602"></A>feelers, and in such a way as to make the flesh of your hand swell up. 
<A NAME="603"></A>Its mouth is in the centre of its body, and it lives adhering to the rock 
<A NAME="604"></A>as an oyster to its shell. If any little fish come up against it it it 
<A NAME="605"></A>clings to it; in fact, just as I described it above as doing to your hand, 
<A NAME="606"></A>so it does to anything edible that comes in its way; and it feeds upon 
<A NAME="607"></A>sea-urchins and scallops. Another species of the sea-nettle roams freely 
<A NAME="608"></A>abroad. The sea-nettle appears to be devoid altogether of excretion, and 
<A NAME="609"></A>in this respect it resembles a plant.
<A NAME="610"></A><BR><BR>Of sea-nettles there are two species, the lesser and more edible, 
<A NAME="611"></A>and the large hard ones, such as are found in the neighbourhood of Chalcis. 
<A NAME="612"></A>In winter time their flesh is firm, and accordingly they are sought after 
<A NAME="613"></A>as articles of food, but in summer weather they are worthless, for they 
<A NAME="614"></A>become thin and watery, and if you catch at them they break at once into 
<A NAME="615"></A>bits, and cannot be taken off the rocks entire; and being oppressed by 
<A NAME="616"></A>the heat they tend to slip back into the crevices of the 
<A NAME="617"></A>rocks.
<A NAME="618"></A><BR><BR>So much for the external and the internal organs of molluscs, crustaceans, 
<A NAME="619"></A>and testaceans.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="620"></A><B>Part 7</B>

<A NAME="621"></A><BR><BR>We now proceed to treat of insects in like manner. This genus comprises 
<A NAME="622"></A>many species, and, though several kinds are clearly related to one another, 
<A NAME="623"></A>these are not classified under one common designation, as in the case of 
<A NAME="624"></A>the bee, the drone, the wasp, and all such insects, and again as in the 
<A NAME="625"></A>case of those that have their wings in a sheath or shard, like the cockchafer, 
<A NAME="626"></A>the carabus or stag-beetle, the cantharis or blister-beetle, and the 
<A NAME="627"></A>like.
<A NAME="628"></A><BR><BR>Insects have three parts common to them all; the head, the trunk 
<A NAME="629"></A>containing the stomach, and a third part in betwixt these two, corresponding 
<A NAME="630"></A>to what in other creatures embraces chest and back. In the majority of 
<A NAME="631"></A>insects this intermediate part is single; but in the long and multipedal 
<A NAME="632"></A>insects it has practically the same number of segments as of 
<A NAME="633"></A>nicks.
<A NAME="634"></A><BR><BR>All insects when cut in two continue to live, excepting such as 
<A NAME="635"></A>are naturally cold by nature, or such as from their minute size chill rapidly; 
<A NAME="636"></A>though, by the way, wasps notwithstanding their small size continue living 
<A NAME="637"></A>after severance. In conjunction with the middle portion either the head 
<A NAME="638"></A>or the stomach can live, but the head cannot live by itself. Insects that 
<A NAME="639"></A>are long in shape and many-footed can live for a long while after being 
<A NAME="640"></A>cut in twain, and the severed portions can move in either direction, backwards 
<A NAME="641"></A>or forwards; thus, the hinder portion, if cut off, can crawl either in 
<A NAME="642"></A>the direction of the section or in the direction of the tail, as is observed 
<A NAME="643"></A>in the scolopendra.
<A NAME="644"></A><BR><BR>All insects have eyes, but no other organ of sense discernible, 
<A NAME="645"></A>except that some insects have a kind of a tongue corresponding to a similar 
<A NAME="646"></A>organ common to all testaceans; and by this organ such insects taste and 
<A NAME="647"></A>imbibe their food. In some insects this organ is soft; in other insects 
<A NAME="648"></A>it is firm; as it is, by the way, in the purple-fish, among testaceans. 
<A NAME="649"></A>In the horsefly and the gadfly this organ is hard, and indeed it is hard 
<A NAME="650"></A>in most insects. In point of fact, such insects as have no sting in the 
<A NAME="651"></A>rear use this organ as a weapon, (and, by the way, such insects as are 
<A NAME="652"></A>provided with this organ are unprovided with teeth, with the exception 
<A NAME="653"></A>of a few insects); the fly by a touch can draw blood with this organ, and 
<A NAME="654"></A>the gnat can prick or sting with it.
<A NAME="655"></A><BR><BR>Certain insects are furnished with prickers or stings. Some insects 
<A NAME="656"></A>have the sting inside, as the bee and the wasp, others outside, as the 
<A NAME="657"></A>scorpion; and, by the way, this is the only insect furnished with a long 
<A NAME="658"></A>tail. And, further, the scorpion is furnished with claws, as is also the 
<A NAME="659"></A>creature resembling a scorpion found within the pages of 
<A NAME="660"></A>books.
<A NAME="661"></A><BR><BR>In addition to their other organs, flying insects are furnished 
<A NAME="662"></A>with wings. Some insects are dipterous or double-winged, as the fly; others 
<A NAME="663"></A>are tetrapterous or furnished with four wings, as the bee; and, by the 
<A NAME="664"></A>way, no insect with only two wings has a sting in the rear. Again, some 
<A NAME="665"></A>winged insects have a sheath or shard for their wings, as the cockchafer; 
<A NAME="666"></A>whereas in others the wings are unsheathed, as in the bee. But in the case 
<A NAME="667"></A>of all alike, flight is in no way modified by tail-steerage, and the wing 
<A NAME="668"></A>is devoid of quill-structure or division of any kind.
<A NAME="669"></A><BR><BR>Again, some insects have antennae in front of their eyes, as the 
<A NAME="670"></A>butterfly and the horned beetle. Such of them as have the power of jumping 
<A NAME="671"></A>have the hinder legs the longer; and these long hind-legs whereby they 
<A NAME="672"></A>jump bend backwards like the hind-legs of quadrupeds. All insects have 
<A NAME="673"></A>the belly different from the back; as, in fact, is the case with all animals. 
<A NAME="674"></A>The flesh of an insect's body is neither shell-like nor is it like the 
<A NAME="675"></A>internal substance of shell-covered animals, nor is it like flesh in the 
<A NAME="676"></A>ordinary sense of the term; but it is a something intermediate in quality. 
<A NAME="677"></A>Wherefore they have nor spine, nor bone, nor sepia-bone, nor enveloping 
<A NAME="678"></A>shell; but their body by its hardness is its own protection and requires 
<A NAME="679"></A>no extraneous support. However, insects have a skin; but the skin is exceedingly 
<A NAME="680"></A>thin. These and such-like are the external organs of 
<A NAME="681"></A>insects.
<A NAME="682"></A><BR><BR>Internally, next after the mouth, comes a gut, in the majority 
<A NAME="683"></A>of cases straight and simple down to the outlet of the residuum: but in 
<A NAME="684"></A>a few cases the gut is coiled. No insect is provided with any viscera, 
<A NAME="685"></A>or is supplied with fat; and these statements apply to all animals devoid 
<A NAME="686"></A>of blood. Some have a stomach also, and attached to this the rest of the 
<A NAME="687"></A>gut, either simple or convoluted as in the case of the acris or 
<A NAME="688"></A>grasshopper.
<A NAME="689"></A><BR><BR>The tettix or cicada, alone of such creatures (and, in fact, alone 
<A NAME="690"></A>of all creatures), is unprovided with a mouth, but it is provided with 
<A NAME="691"></A>the tongue-like formation found in insects furnished with frontward stings; 
<A NAME="692"></A>and this formation in the cicada is long, continuous, and devoid of any 
<A NAME="693"></A>split; and by the aid of this the creature feeds on dew, and on dew only, 
<A NAME="694"></A>and in its stomach no excretion is ever found. Of the cicada there are 
<A NAME="695"></A>several kinds, and they differ from one another in relative magnitude, 
<A NAME="696"></A>and in this respect that the achetes or chirper is provided with a cleft 
<A NAME="697"></A>or aperture under the hypozoma and has in it a membrane quite discernible, 
<A NAME="698"></A>whilst the membrane is indiscernible in the tettigonia.
<A NAME="699"></A><BR><BR>Furthermore, there are some strange creatures to be found in the 
<A NAME="700"></A>sea, which from their rarity we are unable to classify. Experienced fishermen 
<A NAME="701"></A>affirm, some that they have at times seen in the sea animals like sticks, 
<A NAME="702"></A>black, rounded, and of the same thickness throughout; others that they 
<A NAME="703"></A>have seen creatures resembling shields, red in colour, and furnished with 
<A NAME="704"></A>fins packed close together; and others that they have seen creatures resembling 
<A NAME="705"></A>the male organ in shape and size, with a pair of fins in the place of the 
<A NAME="706"></A>testicles, and they aver that on one occasion a creature of this description 
<A NAME="707"></A>was brought up on the end of a nightline.
<A NAME="708"></A><BR><BR>So much then for the parts, external and internal, exceptional 
<A NAME="709"></A>and common, of all animals.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="710"></A><B>Part 8</B>

<A NAME="711"></A><BR><BR>We now proceed to treat of the senses; for there are diversities 
<A NAME="712"></A>in animals with regard to the senses, seeing that some animals have the 
<A NAME="713"></A>use of all the senses, and others the use of a limited number of them. 
<A NAME="714"></A>The total number of the senses (for we have no experience of any special 
<A NAME="715"></A>sense not here included), is five: sight, hearing, smell, taste, and 
<A NAME="716"></A>touch.
<A NAME="717"></A><BR><BR>Man, then, and all vivipara that have feet, and, further, all red-blooded 
<A NAME="718"></A>ovipara, appear to have the use of all the five senses, except where some 
<A NAME="719"></A>isolated species has been subjected to mutilation, as in the case of the 
<A NAME="720"></A>mole. For this animal is deprived of sight; it has no eyes visible, but 
<A NAME="721"></A>if the skin-a thick one, by the way-be stripped off the head, about the 
<A NAME="722"></A>place in the exterior where eyes usually are, the eyes are found inside 
<A NAME="723"></A>in a stunted condition, furnished with all the parts found in ordinary 
<A NAME="724"></A>eyes; that is to say, we find there the black rim, and the fatty part surrounding 
<A NAME="725"></A>it; but all these parts are smaller than the same parts in ordinary visible 
<A NAME="726"></A>eyes. There is no external sign of the existence of these organs in the 
<A NAME="727"></A>mole, owing to the thickness of the skin drawn over them, so that it would 
<A NAME="728"></A>seem that the natural course of development were congenitally arrested; 
<A NAME="729"></A>(for extending from the brain at its junction with the marrow are two strong 
<A NAME="730"></A>sinewy ducts running past the sockets of the eyes, and terminating at the 
<A NAME="731"></A>upper eye-teeth). All the other animals of the kinds above mentioned have 
<A NAME="732"></A>a perception of colour and of sound, and the senses of smell and taste; 
<A NAME="733"></A>the fifth sense, that, namely, of touch, is common to all animals 
<A NAME="734"></A>whatsoever.
<A NAME="735"></A><BR><BR>In some animals the organs of sense are plainly discernible; and 
<A NAME="736"></A>this is especially the case with the eyes. For animals have a special locality 
<A NAME="737"></A>for the eyes, and also a special locality for hearing: that is to say, 
<A NAME="738"></A>some animals have ears, while others have the passage for sound discernible. 
<A NAME="739"></A>It is the same with the sense of smell; that is to say, some animals have 
<A NAME="740"></A>nostrils, and others have only the passages for smell, such as birds. It 
<A NAME="741"></A>is the same also with the organ of taste, the tongue. Of aquatic red-blooded 
<A NAME="742"></A>animals, fishes possess the organ of taste, namely the tongue, but it is 
<A NAME="743"></A>in an imperfect and amorphous form, in other words it is osseous and undetached. 
<A NAME="744"></A>In some fish the palate is fleshy, as in the fresh-water carp, so that 
<A NAME="745"></A>by an inattentive observer it might be mistaken for a 
<A NAME="746"></A>tongue.
<A NAME="747"></A><BR><BR>There is no doubt but that fishes have the sense of taste, for 
<A NAME="748"></A>a great number of them delight in special flavours; and fishes freely take 
<A NAME="749"></A>the hook if it be baited with a piece of flesh from a tunny or from any 
<A NAME="750"></A>fat fish, obviously enjoying the taste and the eating of food of this kind. 
<A NAME="751"></A>Fishes have no visible organs for hearing or for smell; for what might 
<A NAME="752"></A>appear to indicate an organ for smell in the region of the nostril has 
<A NAME="753"></A>no communication with the brain. These indications, in fact, in some cases 
<A NAME="754"></A>lead nowhere, like blind alleys, and in other cases lead only to the gills; 
<A NAME="755"></A>but for all this fishes undoubtedly hear and smell. For they are observed 
<A NAME="756"></A>to run away from any loud noise, such as would be made by the rowing of 
<A NAME="757"></A>a galley, so as to become easy of capture in their holes; for, by the way, 
<A NAME="758"></A>though a sound be very slight in the open air, it has a loud and alarming 
<A NAME="759"></A>resonance to creatures that hear under water. And this is shown in the 
<A NAME="760"></A>capture of the dolphin; for when the hunters have enclosed a shoal of these 
<A NAME="761"></A>fishes with a ring of their canoes, they set up from inside the canoes 
<A NAME="762"></A>a loud splashing in the water, and by so doing induce the creatures to 
<A NAME="763"></A>run in a shoal high and dry up on the beach, and so capture them while 
<A NAME="764"></A>stupefied with the noise. And yet, for all this, the dolphin has no organ 
<A NAME="765"></A>of hearing discernible. Furthermore, when engaged in their craft, fishermen 
<A NAME="766"></A>are particularly careful to make no noise with oar or net; and after they 
<A NAME="767"></A>have spied a shoal, they let down their nets at a spot so far off that 
<A NAME="768"></A>they count upon no noise being likely to reach the shoal, occasioned either 
<A NAME="769"></A>by oar or by the surging of their boats through the water; and the crews 
<A NAME="770"></A>are strictly enjoined to preserve silence until the shoal has been surrounded. 
<A NAME="771"></A>And, at times, when they want the fish to crowd together, they adopt the 
<A NAME="772"></A>stratagem of the dolphin-hunter; in other words they clatter stones together, 
<A NAME="773"></A>that the fish may, in their fright, gather close into one spot, and so 
<A NAME="774"></A>they envelop them within their nets. (Before surrounding them, then, they 
<A NAME="775"></A>preserve silence, as was said; but, after hemming the shoal in, they call 
<A NAME="776"></A>on every man to shout out aloud and make any kind of noise; for on hearing 
<A NAME="777"></A>the noise and hubbub the fish are sure to tumble into the nets from sheer 
<A NAME="778"></A>fright.) Further, when fishermen see a shoal of fish feeding at a distance, 
<A NAME="779"></A>disporting themselves in calm bright weather on the surface of the water, 
<A NAME="780"></A>if they are anxious to descry the size of the fish and to learn what kind 
<A NAME="781"></A>of a fish it is, they may succeed in coming upon the shoal whilst yet basking 
<A NAME="782"></A>at the surface if they sail up without the slightest noise, but if any 
<A NAME="783"></A>man make a noise previously, the shoal will be seen to scurry away in alarm. 
<A NAME="784"></A>Again, there is a small river-fish called the cottus or bullhead; this 
<A NAME="785"></A>creature burrows under a rock, and fishers catch it by clattering stones 
<A NAME="786"></A>against the rock, and the fish, bewildered at the noise, darts out of its 
<A NAME="787"></A>hiding-place. From these facts it is quite obvious that fishes can hear; 
<A NAME="788"></A>and indeed some people, from living near the sea and frequently witnessing 
<A NAME="789"></A>such phenomena, affirm that of all living creatures the fish is the quickest 
<A NAME="790"></A>of hearing. And, by the way, of all fishes the quickest of hearing are 
<A NAME="791"></A>the cestreus or mullet, the chremps, the labrax or basse, the salpe or 
<A NAME="792"></A>saupe, the chromis or sciaena, and such like. Other fishes are less quick 
<A NAME="793"></A>of hearing, and, as might be expected, are more apt to be found living 
<A NAME="794"></A>at the bottom of the sea.
<A NAME="795"></A><BR><BR>The case is similar in regard to the sense of smell. Thus, as a 
<A NAME="796"></A>rule, fishes will not touch a bait that is not fresh, neither are they 
<A NAME="797"></A>all caught by one and the same bait, but they are severally caught by baits 
<A NAME="798"></A>suited to their several likings, and these baits they distinguish by their 
<A NAME="799"></A>sense of smell; and, by the way, some fishes are attracted by malodorous 
<A NAME="800"></A>baits, as the saupe, for instance, is attracted by excrement. Again, a 
<A NAME="801"></A>number of fishes live in caves; and accordingly fishermen, when they want 
<A NAME="802"></A>to entice them out, smear the mouth of a cave with strong-smelling pickles, 
<A NAME="803"></A>and the fish are Soon attracted to the smell. And the eel is caught in 
<A NAME="804"></A>a similar way; for the fisherman lays down an earthen pot that has held 
<A NAME="805"></A>pickles, after inserting a 'weel' in the neck thereof. As a general rule, 
<A NAME="806"></A>fishes are especially attracted by savoury smells. For this reason, fishermen 
<A NAME="807"></A>roast the fleshy parts of the cuttle-fish and use it as bait on account 
<A NAME="808"></A>of its smell, for fish are peculiarly attracted by it; they also bake the 
<A NAME="809"></A>octopus and bait their fish-baskets or weels with it, entirely, as they 
<A NAME="810"></A>say, on account of its smell. Furthermore, gregarious fishes, if fish washings 
<A NAME="811"></A>or bilge-water be thrown overboard, are observed to scud off to a distance, 
<A NAME="812"></A>from apparent dislike of the smell. And it is asserted that they can at 
<A NAME="813"></A>once detect by smell the presence of their own blood; and this faculty 
<A NAME="814"></A>is manifested by their hurrying off to a great distance whenever fish-blood 
<A NAME="815"></A>is spilt in the sea. And, as a general rule, if you bait your weel with 
<A NAME="816"></A>a stinking bait, the fish refuse to enter the weel or even to draw near; 
<A NAME="817"></A>but if you bait the weel with a fresh and savoury bait, they come at once 
<A NAME="818"></A>from long distances and swim into it. And all this is particularly manifest 
<A NAME="819"></A>in the dolphin; for, as was stated, it has no visible organ of hearing, 
<A NAME="820"></A>and yet it is captured when stupefied with noise; and so, while it has 
<A NAME="821"></A>no visible organ for smell, it has the sense of smell remarkably keen. 
<A NAME="822"></A>It is manifest, then, that the animals above mentioned are in possession 
<A NAME="823"></A>of all the five senses.
<A NAME="824"></A><BR><BR>All other animals may, with very few exceptions, be comprehended 
<A NAME="825"></A>within four genera: to wit, molluscs, crustaceans, testaceans, and insects. 
<A NAME="826"></A>Of these four genera, the mollusc, the crustacean, and the insect have 
<A NAME="827"></A>all the senses: at all events, they have sight, smell, and taste. As for 
<A NAME="828"></A>insects, both winged and wingless, they can detect the presence of scented 
<A NAME="829"></A>objects afar off, as for instance bees and snipes detect the presence of 
<A NAME="830"></A>honey at a distance; and do so recognizing it by smell. Many insects are 
<A NAME="831"></A>killed by the smell of brimstone; ants, if the apertures to their dwellings 
<A NAME="832"></A>be smeared with powdered origanum and brimstone, quit their nests; and 
<A NAME="833"></A>most insects may be banished with burnt hart's horn, or better still by 
<A NAME="834"></A>the burning of the gum styrax. The cuttle-fish, the octopus, and the crawfish 
<A NAME="835"></A>may be caught by bait. The octopus, in fact, clings so tightly to the rocks 
<A NAME="836"></A>that it cannot be pulled off, but remains attached even when the knife 
<A NAME="837"></A>is employed to sever it; and yet, if you apply fleabane to the creature, 
<A NAME="838"></A>it drops off at the very smell of it. The facts are similar in regard to 
<A NAME="839"></A>taste. For the food that insects go in quest of is of diverse kinds, and 
<A NAME="840"></A>they do not all delight in the same flavours: for instance, the bee never 
<A NAME="841"></A>settles on a withered or wilted flower, but on fresh and sweet ones; and 
<A NAME="842"></A>the conops or gnat settles only on acrid substances and not on sweet. The 
<A NAME="843"></A>sense of touch, by the way, as has been remarked, is common to all animals. 
<A NAME="844"></A>Testaceans have the senses of smell and taste. With regard to their possession 
<A NAME="845"></A>of the sense of smell, that is proved by the use of baits, e.g. in the 
<A NAME="846"></A>case of the purple-fish; for this creature is enticed by baits of rancid 
<A NAME="847"></A>meat, which it perceives and is attracted to from a great distance. The 
<A NAME="848"></A>proof that it possesses a sense of taste hangs by the proof of its sense 
<A NAME="849"></A>of smell; for whenever an animal is attracted to a thing by perceiving 
<A NAME="850"></A>its smell, it is sure to like the taste of it. Further, all animals furnished 
<A NAME="851"></A>with a mouth derive pleasure or pain from the touch of sapid 
<A NAME="852"></A>juices.
<A NAME="853"></A><BR><BR>With regard to sight and hearing, we cannot make statements with 
<A NAME="854"></A>thorough confidence or on irrefutable evidence. However, the solen or razor-fish, 
<A NAME="855"></A>if you make a noise, appears to burrow in the sand, and to hide himself 
<A NAME="856"></A>deeper when he hears the approach of the iron rod (for the animal, be it 
<A NAME="857"></A>observed, juts a little out of its hole, while the greater part of the 
<A NAME="858"></A>body remains within),-and scallops, if you present your finger near their 
<A NAME="859"></A>open valves, close them tight again as though they could see what you were 
<A NAME="860"></A>doing. Furthermore, when fishermen are laying bait for neritae, they always 
<A NAME="861"></A>get to leeward of them, and never speak a word while so engaged, under 
<A NAME="862"></A>the firm impression that the animal can smell and hear; and they assure 
<A NAME="863"></A>us that, if any one speaks aloud, the creature makes efforts to escape. 
<A NAME="864"></A>With regard to testaceans, of the walking or creeping species the urchin 
<A NAME="865"></A>appears to have the least developed sense of smell; and, of the stationary 
<A NAME="866"></A>species, the ascidian and the barnacle.
<A NAME="867"></A><BR><BR>So much for the organs of sense in the general run of animals. 
<A NAME="868"></A>We now proceed to treat of voice.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="869"></A><B>Part 9</B>

<A NAME="870"></A><BR><BR>Voice and sound are different from one another; and language differs 
<A NAME="871"></A>from voice and sound. The fact is that no animal can give utterance to 
<A NAME="872"></A>voice except by the action of the pharynx, and consequently such animals 
<A NAME="873"></A>as are devoid of lung have no voice; and language is the articulation of 
<A NAME="874"></A>vocal sounds by the instrumentality of the tongue. Thus, the voice and 
<A NAME="875"></A>larynx can emit vocal or vowel sounds; non-vocal or consonantal sounds 
<A NAME="876"></A>are made by the tongue and the lips; and out of these vocal and non-vocal 
<A NAME="877"></A>sounds language is composed. Consequently, animals that have no tongue 
<A NAME="878"></A>at all or that have a tongue not freely detached, have neither voice nor 
<A NAME="879"></A>language; although, by the way, they may be enabled to make noises or sounds 
<A NAME="880"></A>by other organs than the tongue.
<A NAME="881"></A><BR><BR>Insects, for instance, have no voice and no language, but they 
<A NAME="882"></A>can emit sound by internal air or wind, though not by the emission of air 
<A NAME="883"></A>or wind; for no insects are capable of respiration. But some of them make 
<A NAME="884"></A>a humming noise, like the bee and the other winged insects; and others 
<A NAME="885"></A>are said to sing, as the cicada. And all these latter insects make their 
<A NAME="886"></A>special noises by means of the membrane that is underneath the 'hypozoma'-those 
<A NAME="887"></A>insects, that is to say, whose body is thus divided; as for instance, one 
<A NAME="888"></A>species of cicada, which makes the sound by means of the friction of the 
<A NAME="889"></A>air. Flies and bees, and the like, produce their special noise by opening 
<A NAME="890"></A>and shutting their wings in the act of flying; for the noise made is by 
<A NAME="891"></A>the friction of air between the wings when in motion. The noise made by 
<A NAME="892"></A>grasshoppers is produced by rubbing or reverberating with their long 
<A NAME="893"></A>hind-legs.
<A NAME="894"></A><BR><BR>No mollusc or crustacean can produce any natural voice or sound. 
<A NAME="895"></A>Fishes can produce no voice, for they have no lungs, nor windpipe and pharynx; 
<A NAME="896"></A>but they emit certain inarticulate sounds and squeaks, which is what is 
<A NAME="897"></A>called their 'voice', as the lyra or gurnard, and the sciaena (for these 
<A NAME="898"></A>fishes make a grunting kind of noise) and the caprus or boar-fish in the 
<A NAME="899"></A>river Achelous, and the chalcis and the cuckoo-fish; for the chalcis makes 
<A NAME="900"></A>a sort piping sound, and the cuckoo-fish makes a sound greatly like the 
<A NAME="901"></A>cry of the cuckoo, and is nicknamed from the circumstance. The apparent 
<A NAME="902"></A>voice in all these fishes is a sound caused in some cases by a rubbing 
<A NAME="903"></A>motion of their gills, which by the way are prickly, or in other cases 
<A NAME="904"></A>by internal parts about their bellies; for they all have air or wind inside 
<A NAME="905"></A>them, by rubbing and moving which they produce the sounds. Some cartilaginous 
<A NAME="906"></A>fish seem to squeak.
<A NAME="907"></A><BR><BR>But in these cases the term 'voice' is inappropriate; the more 
<A NAME="908"></A>correct expression would be 'sound'. For the scallop, when it goes along 
<A NAME="909"></A>supporting itself on the water, which is technically called 'flying', makes 
<A NAME="910"></A>a whizzing sound; and so does the sea-swallow or flying-fish: for this 
<A NAME="911"></A>fish flies in the air, clean out of the water, being furnished with fins 
<A NAME="912"></A>broad and long. Just then as in the flight of birds the sound made by their 
<A NAME="913"></A>wings is obviously not voice, so is it in the case of all these other 
<A NAME="914"></A>creatures.
<A NAME="915"></A><BR><BR>The dolphin, when taken out of the water, gives a squeak and moans 
<A NAME="916"></A>in the air, but these noises do not resemble those above mentioned. For 
<A NAME="917"></A>this creature has a voice (and can therefore utter vocal or vowel sounds), 
<A NAME="918"></A>for it is furnished with a lung and a windpipe; but its tongue is not loose, 
<A NAME="919"></A>nor has it lips, so as to give utterance to an articulate sound (or a sound 
<A NAME="920"></A>of vowel and consonant in combination.)
<A NAME="921"></A><BR><BR>Of animals which are furnished with tongue and lung, the oviparous 
<A NAME="922"></A>quadrupeds produce a voice, but a feeble one; in some cases, a shrill piping 
<A NAME="923"></A>sound, like the serpent; in others, a thin faint cry; in others, a low 
<A NAME="924"></A>hiss, like the tortoise. The formation of the tongue in the frog is exceptional. 
<A NAME="925"></A>The front part of the tongue, which in other animals is detached, is tightly 
<A NAME="926"></A>fixed in the frog as it is in all fishes; but the part towards the pharynx 
<A NAME="927"></A>is freely detached, and may, so to speak, be spat outwards, and it is with 
<A NAME="928"></A>this that it makes its peculiar croak. The croaking that goes on in the 
<A NAME="929"></A>marsh is the call of the males to the females at rutting time; and, by 
<A NAME="930"></A>the way, all animals have a special cry for the like end at the like season, 
<A NAME="931"></A>as is observed in the case of goats, swine, and sheep. (The bull-frog makes 
<A NAME="932"></A>its croaking noise by putting its under jaw on a level with the surface 
<A NAME="933"></A>of the water and extending its upper jaw to its utmost capacity. The tension 
<A NAME="934"></A>is so great that the upper jaw becomes transparent, and the animal's eyes 
<A NAME="935"></A>shine through the jaw like lamps; for, by the way, the commerce of the 
<A NAME="936"></A>sexes takes place usually in the night time.) Birds can utter vocal sounds; 
<A NAME="937"></A>and such of them can articulate best as have the tongue moderately flat, 
<A NAME="938"></A>and also such as have thin delicate tongues. In some cases, the male and 
<A NAME="939"></A>the female utter the same note; in other cases, different notes. The smaller 
<A NAME="940"></A>birds are more vocal and given to chirping than the larger ones; but in 
<A NAME="941"></A>the pairing season every species of bird becomes particularly vocal. Some 
<A NAME="942"></A>of them call when fighting, as the quail, others cry or crow when challenging 
<A NAME="943"></A>to combat, as the partridge, or when victorious, as the barn-door cock. 
<A NAME="944"></A>In some cases cock-birds and hens sing alike, as is observed in the nightingale, 
<A NAME="945"></A>only that the hen stops singing when brooding or rearing her young; in 
<A NAME="946"></A>other birds, the cocks sing more than the hens; in fact, with barn-door 
<A NAME="947"></A>fowls and quails, the cock sings and the hen does not.
<A NAME="948"></A><BR><BR>Viviparous quadrupeds utter vocal sounds of different kinds, but 
<A NAME="949"></A>they have no power of converse. In fact, this power, or language, is peculiar 
<A NAME="950"></A>to man. For while the capability of talking implies the capability of uttering 
<A NAME="951"></A>vocal sounds, the converse does not hold good. Men that are born deaf are 
<A NAME="952"></A>in all cases also dumb; that is, they can make vocal sounds, but they cannot 
<A NAME="953"></A>speak. Children, just as they have no control over other parts, so have 
<A NAME="954"></A>no control, at first, over the tongue; but it is so far imperfect, and 
<A NAME="955"></A>only frees and detaches itself by degrees, so that in the interval children 
<A NAME="956"></A>for the most part lisp and stutter.
<A NAME="957"></A><BR><BR>Vocal sounds and modes of language differ according to locality. 
<A NAME="958"></A>Vocal sounds are characterized chiefly by their pitch, whether high or 
<A NAME="959"></A>low, and the kinds of sound capable of being produced are identical within 
<A NAME="960"></A>the limits of one and the same species; but articulate sound, that one 
<A NAME="961"></A>might reasonably designate 'language', differs both in various animals, 
<A NAME="962"></A>and also in the same species according to diversity of locality; as for 
<A NAME="963"></A>instance, some partridges cackle, and some make a shrill twittering noise. 
<A NAME="964"></A>Of little birds, some sing a different note from the parent birds, if they 
<A NAME="965"></A>have been removed from the nest and have heard other birds singing; and 
<A NAME="966"></A>a mother-nightingale has been observed to give lessons in singing to a 
<A NAME="967"></A>young bird, from which spectacle we might obviously infer that the song 
<A NAME="968"></A>of the bird was not equally congenital with mere voice, but was something 
<A NAME="969"></A>capable of modification and of improvement. Men have the same voice or 
<A NAME="970"></A>vocal sounds, but they differ from one another in speech or 
<A NAME="971"></A>language.
<A NAME="972"></A><BR><BR>The elephant makes a vocal sound of a windlike sort by the mouth 
<A NAME="973"></A>alone, unaided by the trunk, just like the sound of a man panting or sighing; 
<A NAME="974"></A>but, if it employ the trunk as well, the sound produced is like that of 
<A NAME="975"></A>a hoarse trumpet.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="976"></A><B>Part 10</B>

<A NAME="977"></A><BR><BR>With regard to the sleeping and waking of animals, all creatures 
<A NAME="978"></A>that are red-blooded and provided with legs give sensible proof that they 
<A NAME="979"></A>go to sleep and that they waken up from sleep; for, as a matter of fact, 
<A NAME="980"></A>all animals that are furnished with eyelids shut them up when they go to 
<A NAME="981"></A>sleep. Furthermore, it would appear that not only do men dream, but horses 
<A NAME="982"></A>also, and dogs, and oxen; aye, and sheep, and goats, and all viviparous 
<A NAME="983"></A>quadrupeds; and dogs show their dreaming by barking in their sleep. With 
<A NAME="984"></A>regard to oviparous animals we cannot be sure that they dream, but most 
<A NAME="985"></A>undoubtedly they sleep. And the same may be said of water animals, such 
<A NAME="986"></A>as fishes, molluscs, crustaceans, to wit crawfish and the like. These animals 
<A NAME="987"></A>sleep without doubt, although their sleep is of very short duration. The 
<A NAME="988"></A>proof of their sleeping cannot be got from the condition of their eyes-for 
<A NAME="989"></A>none of these creatures are furnished with eyelids-but can be obtained 
<A NAME="990"></A>only from their motionless repose.
<A NAME="991"></A><BR><BR>Apart from the irritation caused by lice and what are nicknamed 
<A NAME="992"></A>fleas, fish are met with in a state so motionless that one might easily 
<A NAME="993"></A>catch them by hand; and, as a matter of fact, these little creatures, if 
<A NAME="994"></A>the fish remain long in one position, will attack them in myriads and devour 
<A NAME="995"></A>them. For these parasites are found in the depths of the sea, and are so 
<A NAME="996"></A>numerous that they devour any bait made of fish's flesh if it be left long 
<A NAME="997"></A>on the ground at the bottom; and fishermen often draw up a cluster of them, 
<A NAME="998"></A>all clinging on to the bait.
<A NAME="999"></A><BR><BR>But it is from the following facts that we may more reasonably 
<A NAME="1000"></A>infer that fishes sleep. Very often it is possible to take a fish off its 
<A NAME="1001"></A>guard so far as to catch hold of it or to give it a blow unawares; and 
<A NAME="1002"></A>all the while that you are preparing to catch or strike it, the fish is 
<A NAME="1003"></A>quite still but for a slight motion of the tail. And it is quite obvious 
<A NAME="1004"></A>that the animal is sleeping, from its movements if any disturbance be made 
<A NAME="1005"></A>during its repose; for it moves just as you would expect in a creature 
<A NAME="1006"></A>suddenly awakened. Further, owing to their being asleep, fish may be captured 
<A NAME="1007"></A>by torchlight. The watchmen in the tunny-fishery often take advantage of 
<A NAME="1008"></A>the fish being asleep to envelop them in a circle of nets; and it is quite 
<A NAME="1009"></A>obvious that they were thus sleeping by their lying still and allowing 
<A NAME="1010"></A>the glistening under-parts of their bodies to become visible, while the 
<A NAME="1011"></A>capture is taking Place. They sleep in the night-time more than during 
<A NAME="1012"></A>the day; and so soundly at night that you may cast the net without making 
<A NAME="1013"></A>them stir. Fish, as a general rule, sleep close to the ground, or to the 
<A NAME="1014"></A>sand or to a stone at the bottom, or after concealing themselves under 
<A NAME="1015"></A>a rock or the ground. Flat fish go to sleep in the sand; and they can be 
<A NAME="1016"></A>distinguished by the outlines of their shapes in the sand, and are caught 
<A NAME="1017"></A>in this position by being speared with pronged instruments. The basse, 
<A NAME="1018"></A>the chrysophrys or gilt-head, the mullet, and fish of the like sort are 
<A NAME="1019"></A>often caught in the daytime by the prong owing to their having been surprised 
<A NAME="1020"></A>when sleeping; for it is scarcely probable that fish could be pronged while 
<A NAME="1021"></A>awake. Cartilaginous fish sleep at times so soundly that they may be caught 
<A NAME="1022"></A>by hand. The dolphin and the whale, and all such as are furnished with 
<A NAME="1023"></A>a blow-hole, sleep with the blow-hole over the surface of the water, and 
<A NAME="1024"></A>breathe through the blow-hole while they keep up a quiet flapping of their 
<A NAME="1025"></A>fins; indeed, some mariners assure us that they have actually heard the 
<A NAME="1026"></A>dolphin snoring.
<A NAME="1027"></A><BR><BR>Molluscs sleep like fishes, and crustaceans also. It is plain also 
<A NAME="1028"></A>that insects sleep; for there can be no mistaking their condition of motionless 
<A NAME="1029"></A>repose. In the bee the fact of its being asleep is very obvious; for at 
<A NAME="1030"></A>night-time bees are at rest and cease to hum. But the fact that insects 
<A NAME="1031"></A>sleep may be very well seen in the case of common every-day creatures; 
<A NAME="1032"></A>for not only do they rest at night-time from dimness of vision (and, by 
<A NAME="1033"></A>the way, all hard-eyed creatures see but indistinctly), but even if a lighted 
<A NAME="1034"></A>candle be presented they continue sleeping quite as 
<A NAME="1035"></A>soundly.
<A NAME="1036"></A><BR><BR>Of all animals man is most given to dreaming. Children and infants 
<A NAME="1037"></A>do not dream, but in most cases dreaming comes on at the age of four or 
<A NAME="1038"></A>five years. Instances have been known of full-grown men and women that 
<A NAME="1039"></A>have never dreamed at all; in exceptional cases of this kind, it has been 
<A NAME="1040"></A>observed that when a dream occurs in advanced life it prognosticates either 
<A NAME="1041"></A>actual dissolution or a general break-up of the system.
<A NAME="1042"></A><BR><BR>So much then for sensation and for the phenomena of sleeping and 
<A NAME="1043"></A>of awakening.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="1044"></A><B>Part 11</B>

<A NAME="1045"></A><BR><BR>With regard to sex, some animals are divided into male and female, 
<A NAME="1046"></A>but others are not so divided but can only be said in a comparative way 
<A NAME="1047"></A>to bring forth young and to be pregnant. In animals that live confined 
<A NAME="1048"></A>to one spot there is no duality of sex; nor is there such, in fact, in 
<A NAME="1049"></A>any testaceans. In molluscs and in crustaceans we find male and female: 
<A NAME="1050"></A>and, indeed, in all animals furnished with feet, biped or quadruped; in 
<A NAME="1051"></A>short, in all such as by copulation engender either live young or egg or 
<A NAME="1052"></A>grub. In the several genera, with however certain exceptions, there either 
<A NAME="1053"></A>absolutely is or absolutely is not a duality of sex. Thus, in quadrupeds 
<A NAME="1054"></A>the duality is universal, while the absence of such duality is universal 
<A NAME="1055"></A>in testaceans, and of these creatures, as with plants, some individuals 
<A NAME="1056"></A>are fruitful and some are not their lying still
<A NAME="1057"></A><BR><BR>But among insects and fishes, some cases are found wholly devoid 
<A NAME="1058"></A>of this duality of sex. For instance, the eel is neither male nor female, 
<A NAME="1059"></A>and can engender nothing. In fact, those who assert that eels are at times 
<A NAME="1060"></A>found with hair-like or worm-like progeny attached, make only random assertions 
<A NAME="1061"></A>from not having carefully noticed the locality of such attachments. For 
<A NAME="1062"></A>no eel nor animal of this kind is ever viviparous unless previously oviparous; 
<A NAME="1063"></A>and no eel was ever yet seen with an egg. And animals that are viviparous 
<A NAME="1064"></A>have their young in the womb and closely attached, and not in the belly; 
<A NAME="1065"></A>for, if the embryo were kept in the belly, it would be subjected to the 
<A NAME="1066"></A>process of digestion like ordinary food. When people rest duality of sex 
<A NAME="1067"></A>in the eel on the assertion that the head of the male is bigger and longer, 
<A NAME="1068"></A>and the head of the female smaller and more snubbed, they are taking diversity 
<A NAME="1069"></A>of species for diversity of sex.
<A NAME="1070"></A><BR><BR>There are certain fish that are nicknamed the epitragiae, or capon-fish, 
<A NAME="1071"></A>and, by the way, fish of this description are found in fresh water, as 
<A NAME="1072"></A>the carp and the balagrus. This sort of fish never has either roe or milt; 
<A NAME="1073"></A>but they are hard and fat all over, and are furnished with a small gut; 
<A NAME="1074"></A>and these fish are regarded as of super-excellent quality.
<A NAME="1075"></A><BR><BR>Again, just as in testaceans and in plants there is what bears 
<A NAME="1076"></A>and engenders, but not what impregnates, so is it, among fishes, with the 
<A NAME="1077"></A>psetta, the erythrinus, and the channe; for these fish are in all cases 
<A NAME="1078"></A>found furnished with eggs.
<A NAME="1079"></A><BR><BR>As a general rule, in red-blooded animals furnished with feet and 
<A NAME="1080"></A>not oviparous, the male is larger and longer-lived than the female (except 
<A NAME="1081"></A>with the mule, where the female is longer-lived and bigger than the male); 
<A NAME="1082"></A>whereas in oviparous and vermiparous creatures, as in fishes and in insects, 
<A NAME="1083"></A>the female is larger than the male; as, for instance, with the serpent, 
<A NAME="1084"></A>the phalangium or venom-spider, the gecko, and the frog. The same difference 
<A NAME="1085"></A>in size of the sexes is found in fishes, as, for instance, in the smaller 
<A NAME="1086"></A>cartilaginous fishes, in the greater part of the gregarious species, and 
<A NAME="1087"></A>in all that live in and about rocks. The fact that the female is longer-lived 
<A NAME="1088"></A>than the male is inferred from the fact that female fishes are caught older 
<A NAME="1089"></A>than males. Furthermore, in all animals the upper and front parts are better, 
<A NAME="1090"></A>stronger, and more thoroughly equipped in the male than in the female, 
<A NAME="1091"></A>whereas in the female those parts are the better that may be termed hinder-parts 
<A NAME="1092"></A>or underparts. And this statement is applicable to man and to all vivipara 
<A NAME="1093"></A>that have feet. Again, the female is less muscular and less compactly jointed, 
<A NAME="1094"></A>and more thin and delicate in the hair-that is, where hair is found; and, 
<A NAME="1095"></A>where there is no hair, less strongly furnished in some analogous substance. 
<A NAME="1096"></A>And the female is more flaccid in texture of flesh, and more knock-kneed, 
<A NAME="1097"></A>and the shin-bones are thinner; and the feet are more arched and hollow 
<A NAME="1098"></A>in such animals as are furnished with feet. And with regard to voice, the 
<A NAME="1099"></A>female in all animals that are vocal has a thinner and sharper voice than 
<A NAME="1100"></A>the male; except, by the way, with kine, for the lowing and bellowing of 
<A NAME="1101"></A>the cow has a deeper note than that of the bull. With regard to organs
