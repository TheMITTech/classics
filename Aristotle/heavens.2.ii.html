<A NAME="10"></A><B>Part 1</B>
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="11"></A>That the heaven as a whole neither came into being nor admits of destruction, 
<A NAME="12"></A>as some assert, but is one and eternal, with no end or beginning of its 
<A NAME="13"></A>total duration, containing and embracing in itself the infinity of time, 
<A NAME="14"></A>we may convince ourselves not only by the arguments already set forth but 
<A NAME="15"></A>also by a consideration of the views of those who differ from us in providing 
<A NAME="16"></A>for its generation. If our view is a possible one, and the manner of generation 
<A NAME="17"></A>which they assert is impossible, this fact will have great weight in convincing 
<A NAME="18"></A>us of the immortality and eternity of the world. Hence it is well to persuade 
<A NAME="19"></A>oneself of the truth of the ancient and truly traditional theories, that 
<A NAME="20"></A>there is some immortal and divine thing which possesses movement, but movement 
<A NAME="21"></A>such as has no limit and is rather itself the limit of all other movement. 
<A NAME="22"></A>A limit is a thing which contains; and this motion, being perfect, contains 
<A NAME="23"></A>those imperfect motions which have a limit and a goal, having itself no 
<A NAME="24"></A>beginning or end, but unceasing through the infinity of time, and of other 
<A NAME="25"></A>movements, to some the cause of their beginning, to others offering the 
<A NAME="26"></A>goal. The ancients gave to the Gods the heaven or upper place, as being 
<A NAME="27"></A>alone immortal; and our present argument testifies that it is indestructible 
<A NAME="28"></A>and ungenerated. Further, it is unaffected by any mortal discomfort, and, 
<A NAME="29"></A>in addition, effortless; for it needs no constraining necessity to keep 
<A NAME="30"></A>it to its path, and prevent it from moving with some other movement more 
<A NAME="31"></A>natural to itself. Such a constrained movement would necessarily involve 
<A NAME="32"></A>effort the more so, the more eternal it were-and would be inconsistent 
<A NAME="33"></A>with perfection. Hence we must not believe the old tale which says that 
<A NAME="34"></A>the world needs some Atlas to keep it safe-a tale composed, it would seem, 
<A NAME="35"></A>by men who, like later thinkers, conceived of all the upper bodies as earthy 
<A NAME="36"></A>and endowed with weight, and therefore supported it in their fabulous way 
<A NAME="37"></A>upon animate necessity. We must no more believe that than follow Empedocles 
<A NAME="38"></A>when he says that the world, by being whirled round, received a movement 
<A NAME="39"></A>quick enough to overpower its own downward tendency, and thus has been 
<A NAME="40"></A>kept from destruction all this time. Nor, again, is it conceivable that 
<A NAME="41"></A>it should persist eternally by the necessitation of a soul. For a soul 
<A NAME="42"></A>could not live in such conditions painlessly or happily, since the movement 
<A NAME="43"></A>involves constraint, being imposed on the first body, whose natural motion 
<A NAME="44"></A>is different, and imposed continuously. It must therefore be uneasy and 
<A NAME="45"></A>devoid of all rational satisfaction; for it could not even, like the soul 
<A NAME="46"></A>of mortal animals, take recreation in the bodily relaxation of sleep. An 
<A NAME="47"></A>Ixion's lot must needs possess it, without end or respite. If then, as 
<A NAME="48"></A>we said, the view already stated of the first motion is a possible one, 
<A NAME="49"></A>it is not only more appropriate so to conceive of its eternity, but also 
<A NAME="50"></A>on this hypothesis alone are we able to advance a theory consistent with 
<A NAME="51"></A>popular divinations of the divine nature. But of this enough for the 
<A NAME="52"></A>present.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="53"></A><B>Part 2</B>

<A NAME="54"></A><BR><BR>Since there are some who say that there is a right and a left in 
<A NAME="55"></A>the heaven, with those who are known as Pythagoreans-to whom indeed the 
<A NAME="56"></A>view really belongs-we must consider whether, if we are to apply these 
<A NAME="57"></A>principles to the body of the universe, we should follow their statement 
<A NAME="58"></A>of the matter or find a better way. At the start we may say that, if right 
<A NAME="59"></A>and left are applicable, there are prior principles which must first be 
<A NAME="60"></A>applied. These principles have been analysed in the discussion of the movements 
<A NAME="61"></A>of animals, for the reason that they are proper to animal nature. For in 
<A NAME="62"></A>some animals we find all such distinctions of parts as this of right and 
<A NAME="63"></A>left clearly present, and in others some; but in plants we find only above 
<A NAME="64"></A>and below. Now if we are to apply to the heaven such a distinction of parts, 
<A NAME="65"></A>we must exect, as we have said, to find in it also the distinction which 
<A NAME="66"></A>in animals is found first of them all. The distinctions are three, namely, 
<A NAME="67"></A>above and below, front and its opposite, right and left-all these three 
<A NAME="68"></A>oppositions we expect to find in the perfect body-and each may be called 
<A NAME="69"></A>a principle. Above is the principle of length, right of breadth, front 
<A NAME="70"></A>of depth. Or again we may connect them with the various movements, taking 
<A NAME="71"></A>principle to mean that part, in a thing capable of movement, from which 
<A NAME="72"></A>movement first begins. Growth starts from above, locomotion from the right, 
<A NAME="73"></A>sensemovement from in front (for front is simply the part to which the 
<A NAME="74"></A>senses are directed). Hence we must not look for above and below, right 
<A NAME="75"></A>and left, front and back, in every kind of body, but only in those which, 
<A NAME="76"></A>being animate, have a principle of movement within themselves. For in no 
<A NAME="77"></A>inanimate thing do we observe a part from which movement originates. Some 
<A NAME="78"></A>do not move at all, some move, but not indifferently in any direction; 
<A NAME="79"></A>fire, for example, only upward, and earth only to the centre. It is true 
<A NAME="80"></A>that we speak of above and below, right and left, in these bodies relatively 
<A NAME="81"></A>to ourselves. The reference may be to our own right hands, as with the 
<A NAME="82"></A>diviner, or to some similarity to our own members, such as the parts of 
<A NAME="83"></A>a statue possess; or we may take the contrary spatial order, calling right 
<A NAME="84"></A>that which is to our left, and left that which is to our right. We observe, 
<A NAME="85"></A>however, in the things themselves none of these distinctions; indeed if 
<A NAME="86"></A>they are turned round we proceed to speak of the opposite parts as right 
<A NAME="87"></A>and left, a boy land below, front and back. Hence it is remarkable that 
<A NAME="88"></A>the Pythagoreans should have spoken of these two principles, right and 
<A NAME="89"></A>left, only, to the exclusion of the other four, which have as good a title 
<A NAME="90"></A>as they. There is no less difference between above and below or front and 
<A NAME="91"></A>back in animals generally than between right and left. The difference is 
<A NAME="92"></A>sometimes only one of function, sometimes also one of shape; and while 
<A NAME="93"></A>the distinction of above and below is characteristic of all animate things, 
<A NAME="94"></A>whether plants or animals, that of right and left is not found in plants. 
<A NAME="95"></A>Further, inasmuch as length is prior to breadth, if above is the principle 
<A NAME="96"></A>of length, right of breadth, and if the principle of that which is prior 
<A NAME="97"></A>is itself prior, then above will be prior to right, or let us say, since 
<A NAME="98"></A>'prior' is ambiguous, prior in order of generation. If, in addition, above 
<A NAME="99"></A>is the region from which movement originates, right the region in which 
<A NAME="100"></A>it starts, front the region to which it is directed, then on this ground 
<A NAME="101"></A>too above has a certain original character as compared with the other forms 
<A NAME="102"></A>of position. On these two grounds, then, they may fairly be criticized, 
<A NAME="103"></A>first, for omitting the more fundamental principles, and secondly, for 
<A NAME="104"></A>thinking that the two they mentioned were attributable equally to 
<A NAME="105"></A>everything.
<A NAME="106"></A><BR><BR>Since we have already determined that functions of this kind belong 
<A NAME="107"></A>to things which possess, a principle of movement, and that the heaven is 
<A NAME="108"></A>animate and possesses a principle of movement, clearly the heaven must 
<A NAME="109"></A>also exhibit above and below, right and left. We need not be troubled by 
<A NAME="110"></A>the question, arising from the spherical shape of the world, how there 
<A NAME="111"></A>can be a distinction of right and left within it, all parts being alike 
<A NAME="112"></A>and all for ever in motion. We must think of the world as of something 
<A NAME="113"></A>in which right differs from left in shape as well as in other respects, 
<A NAME="114"></A>which subsequently is included in a sphere. The difference of function 
<A NAME="115"></A>will persist, but will appear not to by reason of the regularity of shape. 
<A NAME="116"></A>In the same fashion must we conceive of the beginning of its movement. 
<A NAME="117"></A>For even if it never began to move, yet it must possess a principle from 
<A NAME="118"></A>which it would have begun to move if it had begun, and from which it would 
<A NAME="119"></A>begin again if it came to a stand. Now by its length I mean the interval 
<A NAME="120"></A>between its poles, one pole being above and the other below; for two hemispheres 
<A NAME="121"></A>are specially distinguished from all others by the immobility of the poles. 
<A NAME="122"></A>Further, by 'transverse' in the universe we commonly mean, not above and 
<A NAME="123"></A>below, but a direction crossing the line of the poles, which, by implication, 
<A NAME="124"></A>is length: for transverse motion is motion crossing motion up and down. 
<A NAME="125"></A>Of the poles, that which we see above us is the lower region, and that 
<A NAME="126"></A>which we do not see is the upper. For right in anything is, as we say, 
<A NAME="127"></A>the region in which locomotion originates, and the rotation of the heaven 
<A NAME="128"></A>originates in the region from which the stars rise. So this will be the 
<A NAME="129"></A>right, and the region where they set the left. If then they begin from 
<A NAME="130"></A>the right and move round to the right, the upper must be the unseen pole. 
<A NAME="131"></A>For if it is the pole we see, the movement will be leftward, which we deny 
<A NAME="132"></A>to be the fact. Clearly then the invisible pole is above. And those who 
<A NAME="133"></A>live in the other hemisphere are above and to the right, while we are below 
<A NAME="134"></A>and to the left. This is just the opposite of the view of the Pythagoreans, 
<A NAME="135"></A>who make us above and on the right side and those in the other hemisphere 
<A NAME="136"></A>below and on the left side; the fact being the exact opposite. Relatively, 
<A NAME="137"></A>however, to the secondary revolution, I mean that of the planets, we are 
<A NAME="138"></A>above and on the right and they are below and on the left. For the principle 
<A NAME="139"></A>of their movement has the reverse position, since the movement itself is 
<A NAME="140"></A>the contrary of the other: hence it follows that we are at its beginning 
<A NAME="141"></A>and they at its end. Here we may end our discussion of the distinctions 
<A NAME="142"></A>of parts created by the three dimensions and of the consequent differences 
<A NAME="143"></A>of position.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="144"></A><B>Part 3</B>

<A NAME="145"></A><BR><BR>Since circular motion is not the contrary of the reverse circular 
<A NAME="146"></A>motion, we must consider why there is more than one motion, though we have 
<A NAME="147"></A>to pursue our inquiries at a distance-a distance created not so much by 
<A NAME="148"></A>our spatial position as by the fact that our senses enable us to perceive 
<A NAME="149"></A>very few of the attributes of the heavenly bodies. But let not that deter 
<A NAME="150"></A>us. The reason must be sought in the following facts. Everything which 
<A NAME="151"></A>has a function exists for its function. The activity of God is immortality, 
<A NAME="152"></A>i.e. eternal life. Therefore the movement of that which is divine must 
<A NAME="153"></A>be eternal. But such is the heaven, viz. a divine body, and for that reason 
<A NAME="154"></A>to it is given the circular body whose nature it is to move always in a 
<A NAME="155"></A>circle. Why, then, is not the whole body of the heaven of the same character 
<A NAME="156"></A>as that part? Because there must be something at rest at the centre of 
<A NAME="157"></A>the revolving body; and of that body no part can be at rest, either elsewhere 
<A NAME="158"></A>or at the centre. It could do so only if the body's natural movement were 
<A NAME="159"></A>towards the centre. But the circular movement is natural, since otherwise 
<A NAME="160"></A>it could not be eternal: for nothing unnatural is eternal. The unnatural 
<A NAME="161"></A>is subsequent to the natural, being a derangement of the natural which 
<A NAME="162"></A>occurs in the course of its generation. Earth then has to exist; for it 
<A NAME="163"></A>is earth which is at rest at the centre. (At present we may take this for 
<A NAME="164"></A>granted: it shall be explained later.) But if earth must exist, so must 
<A NAME="165"></A>fire. For, if one of a pair of contraries naturally exists, the other, 
<A NAME="166"></A>if it is really contrary, exists also naturally. In some form it must be 
<A NAME="167"></A>present, since the matter of contraries is the same. Also, the positive 
<A NAME="168"></A>is prior to its privation (warm, for instance, to cold), and rest and heaviness 
<A NAME="169"></A>stand for the privation of lightness and movement. But further, if fire 
<A NAME="170"></A>and earth exist, the intermediate bodies must exist also: each element 
<A NAME="171"></A>stands in a contrary relation to every other. (This, again, we will here 
<A NAME="172"></A>take for granted and try later to explain.) these four elements generation 
<A NAME="173"></A>clearly is involved, since none of them can be eternal: for contraries 
<A NAME="174"></A>interact with one another and destroy one another. Further, it is inconceivable 
<A NAME="175"></A>that a movable body should be eternal, if its movement cannot be regarded 
<A NAME="176"></A>as naturally eternal: and these bodies we know to possess movement. Thus 
<A NAME="177"></A>we see that generation is necessarily involved. But if so, there must be 
<A NAME="178"></A>at least one other circular motion: for a single movement of the whole 
<A NAME="179"></A>heaven would necessitate an identical relation of the elements of bodies 
<A NAME="180"></A>to one another. This matter also shall be cleared up in what follows: but 
<A NAME="181"></A>for the present so much is clear, that the reason why there is more than 
<A NAME="182"></A>one circular body is the necessity of generation, which follows on the 
<A NAME="183"></A>presence of fire, which, with that of the other bodies, follows on that 
<A NAME="184"></A>of earth; and earth is required because eternal movement in one body necessitates 
<A NAME="185"></A>eternal rest in another.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="186"></A><B>Part 4</B>

<A NAME="187"></A><BR><BR>The shape of the heaven is of necessity spherical; for that is 
<A NAME="188"></A>the shape most appropriate to its substance and also by nature 
<A NAME="189"></A>primary.
<A NAME="190"></A><BR><BR>First, let us consider generally which shape is primary among planes 
<A NAME="191"></A>and solids alike. Every plane figure must be either rectilinear or curvilinear. 
<A NAME="192"></A>Now the rectilinear is bounded by more than one line, the curvilinear by 
<A NAME="193"></A>one only. But since in any kind the one is naturally prior to the many 
<A NAME="194"></A>and the simple to the complex, the circle will be the first of plane figures. 
<A NAME="195"></A>Again, if by complete, as previously defined, we mean a thing outside which 
<A NAME="196"></A>no part of itself can be found, and if addition is always possible to the 
<A NAME="197"></A>straight line but never to the circular, clearly the line which embraces 
<A NAME="198"></A>the circle is complete. If then the complete is prior to the incomplete, 
<A NAME="199"></A>it follows on this ground also that the circle is primary among figures. 
<A NAME="200"></A>And the sphere holds the same position among solids. For it alone is embraced 
<A NAME="201"></A>by a single surface, while rectilinear solids have several. The sphere 
<A NAME="202"></A>is among solids what the circle is among plane figures. Further, those 
<A NAME="203"></A>who divide bodies into planes and generate them out of planes seem to bear 
<A NAME="204"></A>witness to the truth of this. Alone among solids they leave the sphere 
<A NAME="205"></A>undivided, as not possessing more than one surface: for the division into 
<A NAME="206"></A>surfaces is not just dividing a whole by cutting it into its parts, but 
<A NAME="207"></A>division of another fashion into parts different in form. It is clear, 
<A NAME="208"></A>then, that the sphere is first of solid figures.
<A NAME="209"></A><BR><BR>If, again, one orders figures according to their numbers, it is 
<A NAME="210"></A>most natural to arrange them in this way. The circle corresponds to the 
<A NAME="211"></A>number one, the triangle, being the sum of two right angles, to the number 
<A NAME="212"></A>two. But if one is assigned to the triangle, the circle will not be a figure 
<A NAME="213"></A>at all.
<A NAME="214"></A><BR><BR>Now the first figure belongs to the first body, and the first body 
<A NAME="215"></A>is that at the farthest circumference. It follows that the body which revolves 
<A NAME="216"></A>with a circular movement must be spherical. The same then will be true 
<A NAME="217"></A>of the body continuous with it: for that which is continuous with the spherical 
<A NAME="218"></A>is spherical. The same again holds of the bodies between these and the 
<A NAME="219"></A>centre. Bodies which are bounded by the spherical and in contact with it 
<A NAME="220"></A>must be, as wholes, spherical; and the bodies below the sphere of the planets 
<A NAME="221"></A>are contiguous with the sphere above them. The sphere then will be spherical 
<A NAME="222"></A>throughout; for every body within it is contiguous and continuous with 
<A NAME="223"></A>spheres.
<A NAME="224"></A><BR><BR>Again, since the whole revolves, palpably and by assumption, in 
<A NAME="225"></A>a circle, and since it has been shown that outside the farthest circumference 
<A NAME="226"></A>there is neither void nor place, from these grounds also it will follow 
<A NAME="227"></A>necessarily that the heaven is spherical. For if it is to be rectilinear 
<A NAME="228"></A>in shape, it will follow that there is place and body and void without 
<A NAME="229"></A>it. For a rectilinear figure as it revolves never continues in the same 
<A NAME="230"></A>room, but where formerly was body, is now none, and where now is none, 
<A NAME="231"></A>body will be in a moment because of the projection at the corners. Similarly, 
<A NAME="232"></A>if the world had some other figure with unequal radii, if, for instance, 
<A NAME="233"></A>it were lentiform, or oviform, in every case we should have to admit space 
<A NAME="234"></A>and void outside the moving body, because the whole body would not always 
<A NAME="235"></A>occupy the same room.
<A NAME="236"></A><BR><BR>Again, if the motion of the heaven is the measure of all movements 
<A NAME="237"></A>whatever in virtue of being alone continuous and regular and eternal, and 
<A NAME="238"></A>if, in each kind, the measure is the minimum, and the minimum movement 
<A NAME="239"></A>is the swiftest, then, clearly, the movement of the heaven must be the 
<A NAME="240"></A>swiftest of all movements. Now of lines which return upon themselves the 
<A NAME="241"></A>line which bounds the circle is the shortest; and that movement is the 
<A NAME="242"></A>swiftest which follows the shortest line. Therefore, if the heaven moves 
<A NAME="243"></A>in a circle and moves more swiftly than anything else, it must necessarily 
<A NAME="244"></A>be spherical.
<A NAME="245"></A><BR><BR>Corroborative evidence may be drawn from the bodies whose position 
<A NAME="246"></A>is about the centre. If earth is enclosed by water, water by air, air by 
<A NAME="247"></A>fire, and these similarly by the upper bodies-which while not continuous 
<A NAME="248"></A>are yet contiguous with them-and if the surface of water is spherical, 
<A NAME="249"></A>and that which is continuous with or embraces the spherical must itself 
<A NAME="250"></A>be spherical, then on these grounds also it is clear that the heavens are 
<A NAME="251"></A>spherical. But the surface of water is seen to be spherical if we take 
<A NAME="252"></A>as our starting-point the fact that water naturally tends to collect in 
<A NAME="253"></A>a hollow place-'hollow' meaning 'nearer the centre'. Draw from the centre 
<A NAME="254"></A>the lines AB, AC, and let their extremities be joined by the straight line 
<A NAME="255"></A>BC. The line AD, drawn to the base of the triangle, will be shorter than 
<A NAME="256"></A>either of the radii. Therefore the place in which it terminates will be 
<A NAME="257"></A>a hollow place. The water then will collect there until equality is established, 
<A NAME="258"></A>that is until the line AE is equal to the two radii. Thus water forces 
<A NAME="259"></A>its way to the ends of the radii, and there only will it rest: but the 
<A NAME="260"></A>line which connects the extremities of the radii is circular: therefore 
<A NAME="261"></A>the surface of the water BEC is spherical.
<A NAME="262"></A><BR><BR>It is plain from the foregoing that the universe is spherical. 
<A NAME="263"></A>It is plain, further, that it is turned (so to speak) with a finish which 
<A NAME="264"></A>no manufactured thing nor anything else within the range of our observation 
<A NAME="265"></A>can even approach. For the matter of which these are composed does not 
<A NAME="266"></A>admit of anything like the same regularity and finish as the substance 
<A NAME="267"></A>of the enveloping body; since with each step away from earth the matter 
<A NAME="268"></A>manifestly becomes finer in the same proportion as water is finer than 
<A NAME="269"></A>earth.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="270"></A><B>Part 5</B>

<A NAME="271"></A><BR><BR>Now there are two ways of moving along a circle, from A to B or 
<A NAME="272"></A>from A to C, and we have already explained that these movements are not 
<A NAME="273"></A>contrary to one another. But nothing which concerns the eternal can be 
<A NAME="274"></A>a matter of chance or spontaneity, and the heaven and its circular motion 
<A NAME="275"></A>are eternal. We must therefore ask why this motion takes one direction 
<A NAME="276"></A>and not the other. Either this is itself an ultimate fact or there is an 
<A NAME="277"></A>ultimate fact behind it. It may seem evidence of excessive folly or excessive 
<A NAME="278"></A>zeal to try to provide an explanation of some things, or of everything, 
<A NAME="279"></A>admitting no exception. The criticism, however, is not always just: one 
<A NAME="280"></A>should first consider what reason there is for speaking, and also what 
<A NAME="281"></A>kind of certainty is looked for, whether human merely or of a more cogent 
<A NAME="282"></A>kind. When any one shall succeed in finding proofs of greater precision, 
<A NAME="283"></A>gratitude will be due to him for the discovery, but at present we must 
<A NAME="284"></A>be content with a probable solution. If nature always follows the best 
<A NAME="285"></A>course possible, and, just as upward movement is the superior form of rectilinear 
<A NAME="286"></A>movement, since the upper region is more divine than the lower, so forward 
<A NAME="287"></A>movement is superior to backward, then front and back exhibits, like right 
<A NAME="288"></A>and left, as we said before and as the difficulty just stated itself suggests, 
<A NAME="289"></A>the distinction of prior and posterior, which provides a reason and so 
<A NAME="290"></A>solves our difficulty. Supposing that nature is ordered in the best way 
<A NAME="291"></A>possible, this may stand as the reason of the fact mentioned. For it is 
<A NAME="292"></A>best to move with a movement simple and unceasing, and, further, in the 
<A NAME="293"></A>superior of two possible directions.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="294"></A><B>Part 6</B>

<A NAME="295"></A><BR><BR>We have next to show that the movement of the heaven is regular 
<A NAME="296"></A>and not irregular. This applies only to the first heaven and the first 
<A NAME="297"></A>movement; for the lower spheres exhibit a composition of several movements 
<A NAME="298"></A>into one. If the movement is uneven, clearly there will be acceleration, 
<A NAME="299"></A>maximum speed, and retardation, since these appear in all irregular motions. 
<A NAME="300"></A>The maximum may occur either at the starting-point or at the goal or between 
<A NAME="301"></A>the two; and we expect natural motion to reach its maximum at the goal, 
<A NAME="302"></A>unnatural motion at the starting-point, and missiles midway between the 
<A NAME="303"></A>two. But circular movement, having no beginning or limit or middle in the 
<A NAME="304"></A>direct sense of the words, has neither whence nor whither nor middle: for 
<A NAME="305"></A>in time it is eternal, and in length it returns upon itself without a break. 
<A NAME="306"></A>If then its movement has no maximum, it can have no irregularity, since 
<A NAME="307"></A>irregularity is produced by retardation and acceleration. Further, since 
<A NAME="308"></A>everything that is moved is moved by something, the cause of the irregularity 
<A NAME="309"></A>of movement must lie either in the mover or in the moved or both. For if 
<A NAME="310"></A>the mover moved not always with the same force, or if the moved were altered 
<A NAME="311"></A>and did not remain the same, or if both were to change, the result might 
<A NAME="312"></A>well be an irregular movement in the moved. But none of these possibilities 
<A NAME="313"></A>can be conceived as actual in the case of the heavens. As to that which 
<A NAME="314"></A>is moved, we have shown that it is primary and simple and ungenerated and 
<A NAME="315"></A>indestructible and generally unchanging; and the mover has an even better 
<A NAME="316"></A>right to these attributes. It is the primary that moves the primary, the 
<A NAME="317"></A>simple the simple, the indestructible and ungenerated that which is indestructible 
<A NAME="318"></A>and ungenerated. Since then that which is moved, being a body, is nevertheless 
<A NAME="319"></A>unchanging, how should the mover, which is incorporeal, be 
<A NAME="320"></A>changed?
<A NAME="321"></A><BR><BR>It follows then, further, that the motion cannot be irregular. 
<A NAME="322"></A>For if irregularity occurs, there must be change either in the movement 
<A NAME="323"></A>as a whole, from fast to slow and slow to fast, or in its parts. That there 
<A NAME="324"></A>is no irregularity in the parts is obvious, since, if there were, some 
<A NAME="325"></A>divergence of the stars would have taken place before now in the infinity 
<A NAME="326"></A>of time, as one moved slower and another faster: but no alteration of their 
<A NAME="327"></A>intervals is ever observed. Nor again is a change in the movement as a 
<A NAME="328"></A>whole admissible. Retardation is always due to incapacity, and incapacity 
<A NAME="329"></A>is unnatural. The incapacities of animals, age, decay, and the like, are 
<A NAME="330"></A>all unnatural, due, it seems, to the fact that the whole animal complex 
<A NAME="331"></A>is made up of materials which differ in respect of their proper places, 
<A NAME="332"></A>and no single part occupies its own place. If therefore that which is primary 
<A NAME="333"></A>contains nothing unnatural, being simple and unmixed and in its proper 
<A NAME="334"></A>place and having no contrary, then it has no place for incapacity, nor, 
<A NAME="335"></A>consequently, for retardation or (since acceleration involves retardation) 
<A NAME="336"></A>for acceleration. Again, it is inconceivable that the mover should first 
<A NAME="337"></A>show incapacity for an infinite time, and capacity afterwards for another 
<A NAME="338"></A>infinity. For clearly nothing which, like incapacity, unnatural ever continues 
<A NAME="339"></A>for an infinity of time; nor does the unnatural endure as long as the natural, 
<A NAME="340"></A>or any form of incapacity as long as the capacity. But if the movement 
<A NAME="341"></A>is retarded it must necessarily be retarded for an infinite time. Equally 
<A NAME="342"></A>impossible is perpetual acceleration or perpetual retardation. For such 
<A NAME="343"></A>movement would be infinite and indefinite, but every movement, in our view, 
<A NAME="344"></A>proceeds from one point to another and is definite in character. Again, 
<A NAME="345"></A>suppose one assumes a minimum time in less than which the heaven could 
<A NAME="346"></A>not complete its movement. For, as a given walk or a given exercise on 
<A NAME="347"></A>the harp cannot take any and every time, but every performance has its 
<A NAME="348"></A>definite minimum time which is unsurpassable, so, one might suppose, the 
<A NAME="349"></A>movement of the heaven could not be completed in any and every time. But 
<A NAME="350"></A>in that case perpetual acceleration is impossible (and, equally, perpetual 
<A NAME="351"></A>retardation: for the argument holds of both and each), if we may take acceleration 
<A NAME="352"></A>to proceed by identical or increasing additions of speed and for an infinite 
<A NAME="353"></A>time. The remaining alternative is to say that the movement exhibits an 
<A NAME="354"></A>alternation of slower and faster: but this is a mere fiction and quite 
<A NAME="355"></A>inconceivable. Further, irregularity of this kind would be particularly 
<A NAME="356"></A>unlikely to pass unobserved, since contrast makes observation 
<A NAME="357"></A>easy.
<A NAME="358"></A><BR><BR>That there is one heaven, then, only, and that it is ungenerated 
<A NAME="359"></A>and eternal, and further that its movement is regular, has now been sufficiently 
<A NAME="360"></A>explained.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="361"></A><B>Part 7</B>

<A NAME="362"></A><BR><BR>We have next to speak of the stars, as they are called, of their 
<A NAME="363"></A>composition, shape, and movements. It would be most natural and consequent 
<A NAME="364"></A>upon what has been said that each of the stars should be composed of that 
<A NAME="365"></A>substance in which their path lies, since, as we said, there is an element 
<A NAME="366"></A>whose natural movement is circular. In so saying we are only following 
<A NAME="367"></A>the same line of thought as those who say that the stars are fiery because 
<A NAME="368"></A>they believe the upper body to be fire, the presumption being that a thing 
<A NAME="369"></A>is composed of the same stuff as that in which it is situated. The warmth 
<A NAME="370"></A>and light which proceed from them are caused by the friction set up in 
<A NAME="371"></A>the air by their motion. Movement tends to create fire in wood, stone, 
<A NAME="372"></A>and iron; and with even more reason should it have that effect on air, 
<A NAME="373"></A>a substance which is closer to fire than these. An example is that of missiles, 
<A NAME="374"></A>which as they move are themselves fired so strongly that leaden balls are 
<A NAME="375"></A>melted; and if they are fired the surrounding air must be similarly affected. 
<A NAME="376"></A>Now while the missiles are heated by reason of their motion in air, which 
<A NAME="377"></A>is turned into fire by the agitation produced by their movement, the upper 
<A NAME="378"></A>bodies are carried on a moving sphere, so that, though they are not themselves 
<A NAME="379"></A>fired, yet the air underneath the sphere of the revolving body is necessarily 
<A NAME="380"></A>heated by its motion, and particularly in that part where the sun is attached 
<A NAME="381"></A>to it. Hence warmth increases as the sun gets nearer or higher or overhead. 
<A NAME="382"></A>Of the fact, then, that the stars are neither fiery nor move in fire, enough 
<A NAME="383"></A>has been said.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="384"></A><B>Part 8</B>

<A NAME="385"></A><BR><BR>Since changes evidently occur not only in the position of the stars 
<A NAME="386"></A>but also in that of the whole heaven, there are three possibilities. Either 
<A NAME="387"></A>(1) both are at rest, or (2) both are in motion, or (3) the one is at rest 
<A NAME="388"></A>and the other in motion.
<A NAME="389"></A><BR><BR>(1) That both should be at rest is impossible; for, if the earth 
<A NAME="390"></A>is at rest, the hypothesis does not account for the observations; and we 
<A NAME="391"></A>take it as granted that the earth is at rest. It remains either that both 
<A NAME="392"></A>are moved, or that the one is moved and the other at 
<A NAME="393"></A>rest.
<A NAME="394"></A><BR><BR>(2) On the view, first, that both are in motion, we have the absurdity 
<A NAME="395"></A>that the stars and the circles move with the same speed, i.e. that the 
<A NAME="396"></A>ace of every star is that of the circle in it moves. For star and circle 
<A NAME="397"></A>are seen to come back to the same place at the same moment; from which 
<A NAME="398"></A>it follows that the star has traversed the circle and the circle has completed 
<A NAME="399"></A>its own movement, i.e. traversed its own circumference, at one and the 
<A NAME="400"></A>same moment. But it is difficult to conceive that the pace of each star 
<A NAME="401"></A>should be exactly proportioned to the size of its circle. That the pace 
<A NAME="402"></A>of each circle should be proportionate to its size is not absurd but inevitable: 
<A NAME="403"></A>but that the same should be true of the movement of the stars contained 
<A NAME="404"></A>in the circles is quite incredible. For if, on the one and, we suppose 
<A NAME="405"></A>that the star which moves on the greater circle is necessarily swifter, 
<A NAME="406"></A>clearly we also admit that if stars shifted their position so as to exchange 
<A NAME="407"></A>circles, the slower would become swifter and the swifter slower. But this 
<A NAME="408"></A>would show that their movement was not their own, but due to the circles. 
<A NAME="409"></A>If, on the other hand, the arrangement was a chance combination, the coincidence 
<A NAME="410"></A>in every case of a greater circle with a swifter movement of the star contained 
<A NAME="411"></A>in it is too much to believe. In one or two cases it might not inconceivably 
<A NAME="412"></A>fall out so, but to imagine it in every case alike is a mere fiction. Besides, 
<A NAME="413"></A>chance has no place in that which is natural, and what happens everywhere 
<A NAME="414"></A>and in every case is no matter of chance.
<A NAME="415"></A><BR><BR>(3) The same absurdity is equally plain if it is supposed that 
<A NAME="416"></A>the circles stand still and that it is the stars themselves which move. 
<A NAME="417"></A>For it will follow that the outer stars are the swifter, and that the pace 
<A NAME="418"></A>of the stars corresponds to the size of their circles.
<A NAME="419"></A><BR><BR>Since, then, we cannot reasonably suppose either that both are 
<A NAME="420"></A>in motion or that the star alone moves, the remaining alternative is that 
<A NAME="421"></A>the circles should move, while the stars are at rest and move with the 
<A NAME="422"></A>circles to which they are attached. Only on this supposition are we involved 
<A NAME="423"></A>in no absurd consequence. For, in the first place, the quicker movement 
<A NAME="424"></A>of the larger circle is natural when all the circles are attached to the 
<A NAME="425"></A>same centre. Whenever bodies are moving with their proper motion, the larger 
<A NAME="426"></A>moves quicker. It is the same here with the revolving bodies: for the are 
<A NAME="427"></A>intercepted by two radii will be larger in the larger circle, and hence 
<A NAME="428"></A>it is not surprising that the revolution of the larger circle should take 
<A NAME="429"></A>the same time as that of the smaller. And secondly, the fact that the heavens 
<A NAME="430"></A>do not break in pieces follows not only from this but also from the proof 
<A NAME="431"></A>already given of the continuity of the whole.
<A NAME="432"></A><BR><BR>Again, since the stars are spherical, as our opponents assert and 
<A NAME="433"></A>we may consistently admit, inasmuch as we construct them out of the spherical 
<A NAME="434"></A>body, and since the spherical body has two movements proper to itself, 
<A NAME="435"></A>namely rolling and spinning, it follows that if the stars have a movement 
<A NAME="436"></A>of their own, it will be one of these. But neither is observed. (1) Suppose 
<A NAME="437"></A>them to spin. They would then stay where they were, and not change their 
<A NAME="438"></A>place, as, by observation and general consent, they do. Further, one would 
<A NAME="439"></A>expect them all to exhibit the same movement: but the only star which appears 
<A NAME="440"></A>to possess this movement is the sun, at sunrise or sunset, and this appearance 
<A NAME="441"></A>is due not to the sun itself but to the distance from which we observe 
<A NAME="442"></A>it. The visual ray being excessively prolonged becomes weak and wavering. 
<A NAME="443"></A>The same reason probably accounts for the apparent twinkling of the fixed 
<A NAME="444"></A>stars and the absence of twinkling in the planets. The planets are near, 
<A NAME="445"></A>so that the visual ray reaches them in its full vigour, but when it comes 
<A NAME="446"></A>to the fixed stars it is quivering because of the distance and its excessive 
<A NAME="447"></A>extension; and its tremor produces an appearance of movement in the star: 
<A NAME="448"></A>for it makes no difference whether movement is set up in the ray or in 
<A NAME="449"></A>the object of vision.
<A NAME="450"></A><BR><BR>(2) On the other hand, it is also clear that the stars do not roll. 
<A NAME="451"></A>For rolling involves rotation: but the 'face', as it is called, of the 
<A NAME="452"></A>moon is always seen. Therefore, since any movement of their own which the 
<A NAME="453"></A>stars possessed would presumably be one proper to themselves, and no such 
<A NAME="454"></A>movement is observed in them, clearly they have no movement of their 
<A NAME="455"></A>own.
<A NAME="456"></A><BR><BR>There is, further, the absurdity that nature has bestowed upon 
<A NAME="457"></A>them no organ appropriate to such movement. For nature leaves nothing to 
<A NAME="458"></A>chance, and would not, while caring for animals, overlook things so precious. 
<A NAME="459"></A>Indeed, nature seems deliberately to have stripped them of everything which 
<A NAME="460"></A>makes selforiginated progression possible, and to have removed them as 
<A NAME="461"></A>far as possible from things which have organs of movement. This is just 
<A NAME="462"></A>why it seems proper that the whole heaven and every star should be spherical. 
<A NAME="463"></A>For while of all shapes the sphere is the most convenient for movement 
<A NAME="464"></A>in one place, making possible, as it does, the swiftest and most selfcontained 
<A NAME="465"></A>motion, for forward movement it is the most unsuitable, least of all resembling 
<A NAME="466"></A>shapes which are self-moved, in that it has no dependent or projecting 
<A NAME="467"></A>part, as a rectilinear figure has, and is in fact as far as possible removed 
<A NAME="468"></A>in shape from ambulatory bodies. Since, therefore, the heavens have to 
<A NAME="469"></A>move in one lace, and the stars are not required to move themselves forward, 
<A NAME="470"></A>it is natural that both should be spherical-a shape which best suits the 
<A NAME="471"></A>movement of the one and the immobility of the other.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="472"></A><B>Part 9</B>

<A NAME="473"></A><BR><BR>From all this it is clear that the theory that the movement of 
<A NAME="474"></A>the stars produces a harmony, i.e. that the sounds they make are concordant, 
<A NAME="475"></A>in spite of the grace and originality with which it has been stated, is 
<A NAME="476"></A>nevertheless untrue. Some thinkers suppose that the motion of bodies of 
<A NAME="477"></A>that size must produce a noise, since on our earth the motion of bodies 
<A NAME="478"></A>far inferior in size and in speed of movement has that effect. Also, when 
<A NAME="479"></A>the sun and the moon, they say, and all the stars, so great in number and 
<A NAME="480"></A>in size, are moving with so rapid a motion, how should they not produce 
<A NAME="481"></A>a sound immensely great? Starting from this argument and from the observation 
<A NAME="482"></A>that their speeds, as measured by their distances, are in the same ratios 
<A NAME="483"></A>as musical concordances, they assert that the sound given forth by the 
<A NAME="484"></A>circular movement of the stars is a harmony. Since, however, it appears 
<A NAME="485"></A>unaccountable that we should not hear this music, they explain this by 
<A NAME="486"></A>saying that the sound is in our ears from the very moment of birth and 
<A NAME="487"></A>is thus indistinguishable from its contrary silence, since sound and silence 
<A NAME="488"></A>are discriminated by mutual contrast. What happens to men, then, is just 
<A NAME="489"></A>what happens to coppersmiths, who are so accustomed to the noise of the 
<A NAME="490"></A>smithy that it makes no difference to them. But, as we said before, melodious 
<A NAME="491"></A>and poetical as the theory is, it cannot be a true account of the facts. 
<A NAME="492"></A>There is not only the absurdity of our hearing nothing, the ground of which 
<A NAME="493"></A>they try to remove, but also the fact that no effect other than sensitive 
<A NAME="494"></A>is produced upon us. Excessive noises, we know, shatter the solid bodies 
<A NAME="495"></A>even of inanimate things: the noise of thunder, for instance, splits rocks 
<A NAME="496"></A>and the strongest of bodies. But if the moving bodies are so great, and 
<A NAME="497"></A>the sound which penetrates to us is proportionate to their size, that sound 
<A NAME="498"></A>must needs reach us in an intensity many times that of thunder, and the 
<A NAME="499"></A>force of its action must be immense. Indeed the reason why we do not hear, 
<A NAME="500"></A>and show in our bodies none of the effects of violent force, is easily 
<A NAME="501"></A>given: it is that there is no noise. But not only is the explanation evident; 
<A NAME="502"></A>it is also a corroboration of the truth of the views we have advanced. 
<A NAME="503"></A>For the very difficulty which made the Pythagoreans say that the motion 
<A NAME="504"></A>of the stars produces a concord corroborates our view. Bodies which are 
<A NAME="505"></A>themselves in motion, produce noise and friction: but those which are attached 
<A NAME="506"></A>or fixed to a moving body, as the parts to a ship, can no more create noise, 
<A NAME="507"></A>than a ship on a river moving with the stream. Yet by the same argument 
<A NAME="508"></A>one might say it was absurd that on a large vessel the motion of mast and 
<A NAME="509"></A>poop should not make a great noise, and the like might be said of the movement 
<A NAME="510"></A>of the vessel itself. But sound is caused when a moving body is enclosed 
<A NAME="511"></A>in an unmoved body, and cannot be caused by one enclosed in, and continuous 
<A NAME="512"></A>with, a moving body which creates no friction. We may say, then, in this 
<A NAME="513"></A>matter that if the heavenly bodies moved in a generally diffused mass of 
<A NAME="514"></A>air or fire, as every one supposes, their motion would necessarily cause 
<A NAME="515"></A>a noise of tremendous strength and such a noise would necessarily reach 
<A NAME="516"></A>and shatter us. Since, therefore, this effect is evidently not produced, 
<A NAME="517"></A>it follows that none of them can move with the motion either of animate 
<A NAME="518"></A>nature or of constraint. It is as though nature had foreseen the result, 
<A NAME="519"></A>that if their movement were other than it is, nothing on this earth could 
<A NAME="520"></A>maintain its character.
<A NAME="521"></A><BR><BR>That the stars are spherical and are not selfmoved, has now been 
<A NAME="522"></A>explained.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="523"></A><B>Part 10</B>

<A NAME="524"></A><BR><BR>With their order-I mean the position of each, as involving the 
<A NAME="525"></A>priority of some and the posteriority of others, and their respective distances 
<A NAME="526"></A>from the extremity-with this astronomy may be left to deal, since the astronomical 
<A NAME="527"></A>discussion is adequate. This discussion shows that the movements of the 
<A NAME="528"></A>several stars depend, as regards the varieties of speed which they exhibit, 
<A NAME="529"></A>on the distance of each from the extremity. It is established that the 
<A NAME="530"></A>outermost revolution of the heavens is a simple movement and the swiftest 
<A NAME="531"></A>of all, and that the movement of all other bodies is composite and relatively 
<A NAME="532"></A>slow, for the reason that each is moving on its own circle with the reverse 
<A NAME="533"></A>motion to that of the heavens. This at once leads us to expect that the 
<A NAME="534"></A>body which is nearest to that first simple revolution should take the longest 
<A NAME="535"></A>time to complete its circle, and that which is farthest from it the shortest, 
<A NAME="536"></A>the others taking a longer time the nearer they are and a shorter time 
<A NAME="537"></A>the farther away they are. For it is the nearest body which is most strongly 
<A NAME="538"></A>influenced, and the most remote, by reason of its distance, which is least 
<A NAME="539"></A>affected, the influence on the intermediate bodies varying, as the mathematicians 
<A NAME="540"></A>show, with their distance.

<A NAME="541"></A><B>Part 11</B>

<A NAME="542"></A><BR><BR>With regard to the shape of each star, the most reasonable view 
<A NAME="543"></A>is that they are spherical. It has been shown that it is not in their nature 
<A NAME="544"></A>to move themselves, and, since nature is no wanton or random creator, clearly 
<A NAME="545"></A>she will have given things which possess no movement a shape particularly 
<A NAME="546"></A>unadapted to movement. Such a shape is the sphere, since it possesses no 
<A NAME="547"></A>instrument of movement. Clearly then their mass will have the form of a 
<A NAME="548"></A>sphere. Again, what holds of one holds of all, and the evidence of our 
<A NAME="549"></A>eyes shows us that the moon is spherical. For how else should the moon 
<A NAME="550"></A>as it waxes and wanes show for the most part a crescent-shaped or gibbous 
<A NAME="551"></A>figure, and only at one moment a half-moon? And astronomical arguments 
<A NAME="552"></A>give further confirmation; for no other hypothesis accounts for the crescent 
<A NAME="553"></A>shape of the sun's eclipses. One, then, of the heavenly bodies being spherical, 
<A NAME="554"></A>clearly the rest will be spherical also.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="555"></A><B>Part 12</B>

<A NAME="556"></A><BR><BR>There are two difficulties, which may very reasonably here be raised, 
<A NAME="557"></A>of which we must now attempt to state the probable solution: for we regard 
<A NAME="558"></A>the zeal of one whose thirst after philosophy leads him to accept even 
<A NAME="559"></A>slight indications where it is very difficult to see one's way, as a proof 
<A NAME="560"></A>rather of modesty than of overconfidence.
<A NAME="561"></A><BR><BR>Of many such problems one of the strangest is the problem why we 
<A NAME="562"></A>find the greatest number of movements in the intermediate bodies, and not, 
<A NAME="563"></A>rather, in each successive body a variety of movement proportionate to 
<A NAME="564"></A>its distance from the primary motion. For we should expect, since the primary 
<A NAME="565"></A>body shows one motion only, that the body which is nearest to it should 
<A NAME="566"></A>move with the fewest movements, say two, and the one next after that with 
<A NAME="567"></A>three, or some similar arrangement. But the opposite is the case. The movements 
<A NAME="568"></A>of the sun and moon are fewer than those of some of the planets. Yet these 
<A NAME="569"></A>planets are farther from the centre and thus nearer to the primary body 
<A NAME="570"></A>than they, as observation has itself revealed. For we have seen the moon, 
<A NAME="571"></A>half-full, pass beneath the planet Mars, which vanished on its shadow side 
<A NAME="572"></A>and came forth by the bright and shining part. Similar accounts of other 
<A NAME="573"></A>stars are given by the Egyptians and Babylonians, whose observations have 
<A NAME="574"></A>been kept for very many years past, and from whom much of our evidence 
<A NAME="575"></A>about particular stars is derived. A second difficulty which may with equal 
<A NAME="576"></A>justice be raised is this. Why is it that the primary motion includes such 
<A NAME="577"></A>a multitude of stars that their whole array seems to defy counting, while 
<A NAME="578"></A>of the other stars each one is separated off, and in no case do we find 
<A NAME="579"></A>two or more attached to the same motion?
<A NAME="580"></A><BR><BR>On these questions, I say, it is well that we should seek to increase 
<A NAME="581"></A>our understanding, though we have but little to go upon, and are placed 
<A NAME="582"></A>at so great a distance from the facts in question. Nevertheless there are 
<A NAME="583"></A>certain principles on which if we base our consideration we shall not find 
<A NAME="584"></A>this difficulty by any means insoluble. We may object that we have been 
<A NAME="585"></A>thinking of the stars as mere bodies, and as units with a serial order 
<A NAME="586"></A>indeed but entirely inanimate; but should rather conceive them as enjoying 
<A NAME="587"></A>life and action. On this view the facts cease to appear surprising. For 
<A NAME="588"></A>it is natural that the best-conditioned of all things should have its good 
<A NAME="589"></A>without action, that which is nearest to it should achieve it by little 
<A NAME="590"></A>and simple action, and that which is farther removed by a complexity of 
<A NAME="591"></A>actions, just as with men's bodies one is in good condition without exercise 
<A NAME="592"></A>at all, another after a short walk, while another requires running and 
<A NAME="593"></A>wrestling and hard training, and there are yet others who however hard 
<A NAME="594"></A>they worked themselves could never secure this good, but only some substitute 
<A NAME="595"></A>for it. To succeed often or in many things is difficult. For instance, 
<A NAME="596"></A>to throw ten thousand Coan throws with the dice would be impossible, but 
<A NAME="597"></A>to throw one or two is comparatively easy. In action, again, when A has 
<A NAME="598"></A>to be done to get B, B to get C, and C to get D, one step or two present 
<A NAME="599"></A>little difficulty, but as the series extends the difficulty grows. We must, 
<A NAME="600"></A>then, think of the action of the lower stars as similar to that of animals 
<A NAME="601"></A>and plants. For on our earth it is man that has the greatest variety of 
<A NAME="602"></A>actions-for there are many goods that man can secure; hence his actions 
<A NAME="603"></A>are various and directed to ends beyond them-while the perfectly conditioned 
<A NAME="604"></A>has no need of action, since it is itself the end, and action always requires 
<A NAME="605"></A>two terms, end and means. The lower animals have less variety of action 
<A NAME="606"></A>than man; and plants perhaps have little action and of one kind only. For 
<A NAME="607"></A>either they have but one attainable good (as indeed man has), or, if several, 
<A NAME="608"></A>each contributes directly to their ultimate good. One thing then has and 
<A NAME="609"></A>enjoys the ultimate good, other things attain to it, one immediately by 
<A NAME="610"></A>few steps, another by many, while yet another does not even attempt to 
<A NAME="611"></A>secure it but is satisfied to reach a point not far removed from that consummation. 
<A NAME="612"></A>Thus, taking health as the end, there will be one thing that always possesses 
<A NAME="613"></A>health, others that attain it, one by reducing flesh, another by running 
<A NAME="614"></A>and thus reducing flesh, another by taking steps to enable himself to run, 
<A NAME="615"></A>thus further increasing the number of movements, while another cannot attain 
<A NAME="616"></A>health itself, but only running or reduction of flesh, so that one or other 
<A NAME="617"></A>of these is for such a being the end. For while it is clearly best for 
<A NAME="618"></A>any being to attain the real end, yet, if that cannot be, the nearer it 
<A NAME="619"></A>is to the best the better will be its state. It is for this reason that 
<A NAME="620"></A>the earth moves not at all and the bodies near to it with few movements. 
<A NAME="621"></A>For they do not attain the final end, but only come as near to it as their 
<A NAME="622"></A>share in the divine principle permits. But the first heaven finds it immediately 
<A NAME="623"></A>with a single movement, and the bodies intermediate between the first and 
<A NAME="624"></A>last heavens attain it indeed, but at the cost of a multiplicity of 
<A NAME="625"></A>movement.
<A NAME="626"></A><BR><BR>As to the difficulty that into the one primary motion is crowded 
<A NAME="627"></A>a vast multitude of stars, while of the other stars each has been separately 
<A NAME="628"></A>given special movements of its own, there is in the first place this reason 
<A NAME="629"></A>for regarding the arrangement as a natural one. In thinking of the life 
<A NAME="630"></A>and moving principle of the several heavens one must regard the first as 
<A NAME="631"></A>far superior to the others. Such a superiority would be reasonable. For 
<A NAME="632"></A>this single first motion has to move many of the divine bodies, while the 
<A NAME="633"></A>numerous other motions move only one each, since each single planet moves 
<A NAME="634"></A>with a variety of motions. Thus, then, nature makes matters equal and establishes 
<A NAME="635"></A>a certain order, giving to the single motion many bodies and to the single 
<A NAME="636"></A>body many motions. And there is a second reason why the other motions have 
<A NAME="637"></A>each only one body, in that each of them except the last, i.e. that which 
<A NAME="638"></A>contains the one star, is really moving many bodies. For this last sphere 
<A NAME="639"></A>moves with many others, to which it is fixed, each sphere being actually 
<A NAME="640"></A>a body; so that its movement will be a joint product. Each sphere, in fact, 
<A NAME="641"></A>has its particular natural motion, to which the general movement is, as 
<A NAME="642"></A>it were, added. But the force of any limited body is only adequate to moving 
<A NAME="643"></A>a limited body.
<A NAME="644"></A><BR><BR>The characteristics of the stars which move with a circular motion, 
<A NAME="645"></A>in respect of substance and shape, movement and order, have now been sufficiently 
<A NAME="646"></A>explained.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="647"></A><B>Part 13</B>

<A NAME="648"></A><BR><BR>It remains to speak of the earth, of its position, of the question 
<A NAME="649"></A>whether it is at rest or in motion, and of its shape.
<A NAME="650"></A><BR><BR><B>I.</B> As to its position there is some difference of opinion. 
<A NAME="651"></A>Most people-all, in fact, who regard the whole heaven as finite-say it 
<A NAME="652"></A>lies at the centre. But the Italian philosophers known as Pythagoreans 
<A NAME="653"></A>take the contrary view. At the centre, they say, is fire, and the earth 
<A NAME="654"></A>is one of the stars, creating night and day by its circular motion about 
<A NAME="655"></A>the centre. They further construct another earth in opposition to ours 
<A NAME="656"></A>to which they give the name counterearth. In all this they are not seeking 
<A NAME="657"></A>for theories and causes to account for observed facts, but rather forcing 
<A NAME="658"></A>their observations and trying to accommodate them to certain theories and 
<A NAME="659"></A>opinions of their own. But there are many others who would agree that it 
<A NAME="660"></A>is wrong to give the earth the central position, looking for confirmation 
<A NAME="661"></A>rather to theory than to the facts of observation. Their view is that the 
<A NAME="662"></A>most precious place befits the most precious thing: but fire, they say, 
<A NAME="663"></A>is more precious than earth, and the limit than the intermediate, and the 
<A NAME="664"></A>circumference and the centre are limits. Reasoning on this basis they take 
<A NAME="665"></A>the view that it is not earth that lies at the centre of the sphere, but 
<A NAME="666"></A>rather fire. The Pythagoreans have a further reason. They hold that the 
<A NAME="667"></A>most important part of the world, which is the centre, should be most strictly 
<A NAME="668"></A>guarded, and name it, or rather the fire which occupies that place, the 
<A NAME="669"></A>'Guardhouse of Zeus', as if the word 'centre' were quite unequivocal, and 
<A NAME="670"></A>the centre of the mathematical figure were always the same with that of 
<A NAME="671"></A>the thing or the natural centre. But it is better to conceive of the case 
<A NAME="672"></A>of the whole heaven as analogous to that of animals, in which the centre 
<A NAME="673"></A>of the animal and that of the body are different. For this reason they 
<A NAME="674"></A>have no need to be so disturbed about the world, or to call in a guard 
<A NAME="675"></A>for its centre: rather let them look for the centre in the other sense 
<A NAME="676"></A>and tell us what it is like and where nature has set it. That centre will 
<A NAME="677"></A>be something primary and precious; but to the mere position we should give 
<A NAME="678"></A>the last place rather than the first. For the middle is what is defined, 
<A NAME="679"></A>and what defines it is the limit, and that which contains or limits is 
<A NAME="680"></A>more precious than that which is limited, see ing that the latter is the 
<A NAME="681"></A>matter and the former the essence of the system.
<A NAME="682"></A><BR><BR><B>II.</B> As to the position of the earth, then, this is the view 
<A NAME="683"></A>which some advance, and the views advanced concerning its rest or motion 
<A NAME="684"></A>are similar. For here too there is no general agreement. All who deny that 
<A NAME="685"></A>the earth lies at the centre think that it revolves about the centre, and 
<A NAME="686"></A>not the earth only but, as we said before, the counter-earth as well. Some 
<A NAME="687"></A>of them even consider it possible that there are several bodies so moving, 
<A NAME="688"></A>which are invisible to us owing to the interposition of the earth. This, 
<A NAME="689"></A>they say, accounts for the fact that eclipses of the moon are more frequent 
<A NAME="690"></A>than eclipses of the sun: for in addition to the earth each of these moving 
<A NAME="691"></A>bodies can obstruct it. Indeed, as in any case the surface of the earth 
<A NAME="692"></A>is not actually a centre but distant from it a full hemisphere, there is 
<A NAME="693"></A>no more difficulty, they think, in accounting for the observed facts on 
<A NAME="694"></A>their view that we do not dwell at the centre, than on the common view 
<A NAME="695"></A>that the earth is in the middle. Even as it is, there is nothing in the 
<A NAME="696"></A>observations to suggest that we are removed from the centre by half the 
<A NAME="697"></A>diameter of the earth. Others, again, say that the earth, which lies at 
<A NAME="698"></A>the centre, is 'rolled', and thus in motion, about the axis of the whole 
<A NAME="699"></A>heaven, So it stands written in the Timaeus.
<A NAME="700"></A><BR><BR><B>III.</B> There are similar disputes about the shape of the earth. 
<A NAME="701"></A>Some think it is spherical, others that it is flat and drum-shaped. For 
<A NAME="702"></A>evidence they bring the fact that, as the sun rises and sets, the part 
<A NAME="703"></A>concealed by the earth shows a straight and not a curved edge, whereas 
<A NAME="704"></A>if the earth were spherical the line of section would have to be circular. 
<A NAME="705"></A>In this they leave out of account the great distance of the sun from the 
<A NAME="706"></A>earth and the great size of the circumference, which, seen from a distance 
<A NAME="707"></A>on these apparently small circles appears straight. Such an appearance 
<A NAME="708"></A>ought not to make them doubt the circular shape of the earth. But they 
<A NAME="709"></A>have another argument. They say that because it is at rest, the earth must 
<A NAME="710"></A>necessarily have this shape. For there are many different ways in which 
<A NAME="711"></A>the movement or rest of the earth has been conceived.
<A NAME="712"></A><BR><BR>The difficulty must have occurred to every one. It would indeed 
<A NAME="713"></A>be a complacent mind that felt no surprise that, while a little bit of 
<A NAME="714"></A>earth, let loose in mid-air moves and will not stay still, and more there 
<A NAME="715"></A>is of it the faster it moves, the whole earth, free in midair, should show 
<A NAME="716"></A>no movement at all. Yet here is this great weight of earth, and it is at 
<A NAME="717"></A>rest. And again, from beneath one of these moving fragments of earth, before 
<A NAME="718"></A>it falls, take away the earth, and it will continue its downward movement 
<A NAME="719"></A>with nothing to stop it. The difficulty then, has naturally passed into 
<A NAME="720"></A>a common place of philosophy; and one may well wonder that the solutions 
<A NAME="721"></A>offered are not seen to involve greater absurdities than the problem 
<A NAME="722"></A>itself.
<A NAME="723"></A><BR><BR>By these considerations some have been led to assert that the earth 
<A NAME="724"></A>below us is infinite, saying, with Xenophanes of Colophon, that it has 
<A NAME="725"></A>'pushed its roots to infinity',-in order to save the trouble of seeking 
<A NAME="726"></A>for the cause. Hence the sharp rebuke of Empedocles, in the words 'if the 
<A NAME="727"></A>deeps of the earth are endless and endless the ample ether-such is the 
<A NAME="728"></A>vain tale told by many a tongue, poured from the mouths of those who have 
<A NAME="729"></A>seen but little of the whole. Others say the earth rests upon water. This, 
<A NAME="730"></A>indeed, is the oldest theory that has been preserved, and is attributed 
<A NAME="731"></A>to Thales of Miletus. It was supposed to stay still because it floated 
<A NAME="732"></A>like wood and other similar substances, which are so constituted as to 
<A NAME="733"></A>rest upon but not upon air. As if the same account had not to be given 
<A NAME="734"></A>of the water which carries the earth as of the earth itself! It is not 
<A NAME="735"></A>the nature of water, any more than of earth, to stay in mid-air: it must 
<A NAME="736"></A>have something to rest upon. Again, as air is lighter than water, so is 
<A NAME="737"></A>water than earth: how then can they think that the naturally lighter substance 
<A NAME="738"></A>lies below the heavier? Again, if the earth as a whole is capable of floating 
<A NAME="739"></A>upon water, that must obviously be the case with any part of it. But observation 
<A NAME="740"></A>shows that this is not the case. Any piece of earth goes to the bottom, 
<A NAME="741"></A>the quicker the larger it is. These thinkers seem to push their inquiries 
<A NAME="742"></A>some way into the problem, but not so far as they might. It is what we 
<A NAME="743"></A>are all inclined to do, to direct our inquiry not by the matter itself, 
<A NAME="744"></A>but by the views of our opponents: and even when interrogating oneself 
<A NAME="745"></A>one pushes the inquiry only to the point at which one can no longer offer 
<A NAME="746"></A>any opposition. Hence a good inquirer will be one who is ready in bringing 
<A NAME="747"></A>forward the objections proper to the genus, and that he will be when he 
<A NAME="748"></A>has gained an understanding of all the differences.
<A NAME="749"></A><BR><BR>Anaximenes and Anaxagoras and Democritus give the flatness of the 
<A NAME="750"></A>earth as the cause of its staying still. Thus, they say, it does not cut, 
<A NAME="751"></A>but covers like a lid, the air beneath it. This seems to be the way of 
<A NAME="752"></A>flat-shaped bodies: for even the wind can scarcely move them because of 
<A NAME="753"></A>their power of resistance. The same immobility, they say, is produced by 
<A NAME="754"></A>the flatness of the surface which the earth presents to the air which underlies 
<A NAME="755"></A>it; while the air, not having room enough to change its place because it 
<A NAME="756"></A>is underneath the earth, stays there in a mass, like the water in the case 
<A NAME="757"></A>of the water-clock. And they adduce an amount of evidence to prove that 
<A NAME="758"></A>air, when cut off and at rest, can bear a considerable 
<A NAME="759"></A>weight.
<A NAME="760"></A><BR><BR>Now, first, if the shape of the earth is not flat, its flatness 
<A NAME="761"></A>cannot be the cause of its immobility. But in their own account it is rather 
<A NAME="762"></A>the size of the earth than its flatness that causes it to remain at rest. 
<A NAME="763"></A>For the reason why the air is so closely confined that it cannot find a 
<A NAME="764"></A>passage, and therefore stays where it is, is its great amount: and this 
<A NAME="765"></A>amount great because the body which isolates it, the earth, is very large. 
<A NAME="766"></A>This result, then, will follow, even if the earth is spherical, so long 
<A NAME="767"></A>as it retains its size. So far as their arguments go, the earth will still 
<A NAME="768"></A>be at rest.
<A NAME="769"></A><BR><BR>In general, our quarrel with those who speak of movement in this 
<A NAME="770"></A>way cannot be confined to the parts; it concerns the whole universe. One 
<A NAME="771"></A>must decide at the outset whether bodies have a natural movement or not, 
<A NAME="772"></A>whether there is no natural but only constrained movement. Seeing, however, 
<A NAME="773"></A>that we have already decided this matter to the best of our ability, we 
<A NAME="774"></A>are entitled to treat our results as representing fact. Bodies, we say, 
<A NAME="775"></A>which have no natural movement, have no constrained movement; and where 
<A NAME="776"></A>there is no natural and no constrained movement there will be no movement 
<A NAME="777"></A>at all. This is a conclusion, the necessity of which we have already decided, 
<A NAME="778"></A>and we have seen further that rest also will be inconceivable, since rest, 
<A NAME="779"></A>like movement, is either natural or constrained. But if there is any natural 
<A NAME="780"></A>movement, constraint will not be the sole principle of motion or of rest. 
<A NAME="781"></A>If, then, it is by constraint that the earth now keeps its place, the so-called 
<A NAME="782"></A>'whirling' movement by which its parts came together at the centre was 
<A NAME="783"></A>also constrained. (The form of causation supposed they all borrow from 
<A NAME="784"></A>observations of liquids and of air, in which the larger and heavier bodies 
<A NAME="785"></A>always move to the centre of the whirl. This is thought by all those who 
<A NAME="786"></A>try to generate the heavens to explain why the earth came together at the 
<A NAME="787"></A>centre. They then seek a reason for its staying there; and some say, in 
<A NAME="788"></A>the manner explained, that the reason is its size and flatness, others, 
<A NAME="789"></A>with Empedocles, that the motion of the heavens, moving about it at a higher 
<A NAME="790"></A>speed, prevents movement of the earth, as the water in a cup, when the 
<A NAME="791"></A>cup is given a circular motion, though it is often underneath the bronze, 
<A NAME="792"></A>is for this same reason prevented from moving with the downward movement 
<A NAME="793"></A>which is natural to it.) But suppose both the 'whirl' and its flatness 
<A NAME="794"></A>(the air beneath being withdrawn) cease to prevent the earth's motion, 
<A NAME="795"></A>where will the earth move to then? Its movement to the centre was constrained, 
<A NAME="796"></A>and its rest at the centre is due to constraint; but there must be some 
<A NAME="797"></A>motion which is natural to it. Will this be upward motion or downward or 
<A NAME="798"></A>what? It must have some motion; and if upward and downward motion are alike 
<A NAME="799"></A>to it, and the air above the earth does not prevent upward movement, then 
<A NAME="800"></A>no more could air below it prevent downward movement. For the same cause 
<A NAME="801"></A>must necessarily have the same effect on the same thing.
<A NAME="802"></A><BR><BR>Further, against Empedocles there is another point which might 
<A NAME="803"></A>be made. When the elements were separated off by Hate, what caused the 
<A NAME="804"></A>earth to keep its place? Surely the 'whirl' cannot have been then also 
<A NAME="805"></A>the cause. It is absurd too not to perceive that, while the whirling movement 
<A NAME="806"></A>may have been responsible for the original coming together of the art of 
<A NAME="807"></A>earth at the centre, the question remains, why now do all heavy bodies 
<A NAME="808"></A>move to the earth. For the whirl surely does not come near us. Why, again, 
<A NAME="809"></A>does fire move upward? Not, surely, because of the whirl. But if fire is 
<A NAME="810"></A>naturally such as to move in a certain direction, clearly the same may 
<A NAME="811"></A>be supposed to hold of earth. Again, it cannot be the whirl which determines 
<A NAME="812"></A>the heavy and the light. Rather that movement caused the pre-existent heavy 
<A NAME="813"></A>and light things to go to the middle and stay on the surface respectively. 
<A NAME="814"></A>Thus, before ever the whirl began, heavy and light existed; and what can 
<A NAME="815"></A>have been the ground of their distinction, or the manner and direction 
<A NAME="816"></A>of their natural movements? In the infinite chaos there can have been neither 
<A NAME="817"></A>above nor below, and it is by these that heavy and light are 
<A NAME="818"></A>determined.
<A NAME="819"></A><BR><BR>It is to these causes that most writers pay attention: but there 
<A NAME="820"></A>are some, Anaximander, for instance, among the ancients, who say that the 
<A NAME="821"></A>earth keeps its place because of its indifference. Motion upward and downward 
<A NAME="822"></A>and sideways were all, they thought, equally inappropriate to that which 
<A NAME="823"></A>is set at the centre and indifferently related to every extreme point; 
<A NAME="824"></A>and to move in contrary directions at the same time was impossible: so 
<A NAME="825"></A>it must needs remain still. This view is ingenious but not true. The argument 
<A NAME="826"></A>would prove that everything, whatever it be, which is put at the centre, 
<A NAME="827"></A>must stay there. Fire, then, will rest at the centre: for the proof turns 
<A NAME="828"></A>on no peculiar property of earth. But this does not follow. The observed 
<A NAME="829"></A>facts about earth are not only that it remains at the centre, but also 
<A NAME="830"></A>that it moves to the centre. The place to which any fragment of earth moves 
<A NAME="831"></A>must necessarily be the place to which the whole moves; and in the place 
<A NAME="832"></A>to which a thing naturally moves, it will naturally rest. The reason then 
<A NAME="833"></A>is not in the fact that the earth is indifferently related to every extreme 
<A NAME="834"></A>point: for this would apply to any body, whereas movement to the centre 
<A NAME="835"></A>is peculiar to earth. Again it is absurd to look for a reason why the earth 
<A NAME="836"></A>remains at the centre and not for a reason why fire remains at the extremity. 
<A NAME="837"></A>If the extremity is the natural place of fire, clearly earth must also 
<A NAME="838"></A>have a natural place. But suppose that the centre is not its place, and 
<A NAME="839"></A>that the reason of its remaining there is this necessity of indifference-on 
<A NAME="840"></A>the analogy of the hair which, it is said, however great the tension, will 
<A NAME="841"></A>not break under it, if it be evenly distributed, or of the men who, though 
<A NAME="842"></A>exceedingly hungry and thirsty, and both equally, yet being equidistant 
<A NAME="843"></A>from food and drink, is therefore bound to stay where he is-even so, it 
<A NAME="844"></A>still remains to explain why fire stays at the extremities. It is strange, 
<A NAME="845"></A>too, to ask about things staying still but not about their motion,-why, 
<A NAME="846"></A>I mean, one thing, if nothing stops it, moves up, and another thing to 
<A NAME="847"></A>the centre. Again, their statements are not true. It happens, indeed, to 
<A NAME="848"></A>be the case that a thing to which movement this way and that is equally 
<A NAME="849"></A>inappropriate is obliged to remain at the centre. But so far as their argument 
<A NAME="850"></A>goes, instead of remaining there, it will move, only not as a mass but 
<A NAME="851"></A>in fragments. For the argument applies equally to fire. Fire, if set at 
<A NAME="852"></A>the centre, should stay there, like earth, since it will be indifferently 
<A NAME="853"></A>related to every point on the extremity. Nevertheless it will move, as 
<A NAME="854"></A>in fact it always does move when nothing stops it, away from the centre 
<A NAME="855"></A>to the extremity. It will not, however, move in a mass to a single point 
<A NAME="856"></A>on the circumference-the only possible result on the lines of the indifference 
<A NAME="857"></A>theory-but rather each corresponding portion of fire to the corresponding 
<A NAME="858"></A>part of the extremity, each fourth part, for instance, to a fourth part 
<A NAME="859"></A>of the circumference. For since no body is a point, it will have parts. 
<A NAME="860"></A>The expansion, when the body increased the place occupied, would be on 
<A NAME="861"></A>the same principle as the contraction, in which the place was diminished. 
<A NAME="862"></A>Thus, for all the indifference theory shows to the contrary, earth also 
<A NAME="863"></A>would have moved in this manner away from the centre, unless the centre 
<A NAME="864"></A>had been its natural place.
<A NAME="865"></A><BR><BR>We have now outlined the views held as to the shape, position, 
<A NAME="866"></A>and rest or movement of the earth.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="867"></A><B>Part 14</B>

<A NAME="868"></A><BR><BR>Let us first decide the question whether the earth moves or is 
<A NAME="869"></A>at rest. For, as we said, there are some who make it one of the stars, 
<A NAME="870"></A>and others who, setting it at the centre, suppose it to be 'rolled' and 
<A NAME="871"></A>in motion about the pole as axis. That both views are untenable will be 
<A NAME="872"></A>clear if we take as our starting-point the fact that the earth's motion, 
<A NAME="873"></A>whether the earth be at the centre or away from it, must needs be a constrained 
<A NAME="874"></A>motion. It cannot be the movement of the earth itself. If it were, any 
<A NAME="875"></A>portion of it would have this movement; but in fact every part moves in 
<A NAME="876"></A>a straight line to the centre. Being, then, constrained and unnatural, 
<A NAME="877"></A>the movement could not be eternal. But the order of the universe is eternal. 
<A NAME="878"></A>Again, everything that moves with the circular movement, except the first 
<A NAME="879"></A>sphere, is observed to be passed, and to move with more than one motion. 
<A NAME="880"></A>The earth, then, also, whether it move about the centre or as stationary 
<A NAME="881"></A>at it, must necessarily move with two motions. But if this were so, there 
<A NAME="882"></A>would have to be passings and turnings of the fixed stars. Yet no such 
<A NAME="883"></A>thing is observed. The same stars always rise and set in the same parts 
<A NAME="884"></A>of the earth.
<A NAME="885"></A><BR><BR>Further, the natural movement of the earth, part and whole alike, 
<A NAME="886"></A>is the centre of the whole-whence the fact that it is now actually situated 
<A NAME="887"></A>at the centre-but it might be questioned since both centres are the same, 
<A NAME="888"></A>which centre it is that portions of earth and other heavy things move to. 
<A NAME="889"></A>Is this their goal because it is the centre of the earth or because it 
<A NAME="890"></A>is the centre of the whole? The goal, surely, must be the centre of the 
<A NAME="891"></A>whole. For fire and other light things move to the extremity of the area 
<A NAME="892"></A>which contains the centre. It happens, however, that the centre of the 
<A NAME="893"></A>earth and of the whole is the same. Thus they do move to the centre of 
<A NAME="894"></A>the earth, but accidentally, in virtue of the fact that the earth's centre 
<A NAME="895"></A>lies at the centre of the whole. That the centre of the earth is the goal 
<A NAME="896"></A>of their movement is indicated by the fact that heavy bodies moving towards 
<A NAME="897"></A>the earth do not parallel but so as to make equal angles, and thus to a 
<A NAME="898"></A>single centre, that of the earth. It is clear, then, that the earth must 
<A NAME="899"></A>be at the centre and immovable, not only for the reasons already given, 
<A NAME="900"></A>but also because heavy bodies forcibly thrown quite straight upward return 
<A NAME="901"></A>to the point from which they started, even if they are thrown to an infinite 
<A NAME="902"></A>distance. From these considerations then it is clear that the earth does 
<A NAME="903"></A>not move and does not lie elsewhere than at the centre.
<A NAME="904"></A><BR><BR>From what we have said the explanation of the earth's immobility 
<A NAME="905"></A>is also apparent. If it is the nature of earth, as observation shows, to 
<A NAME="906"></A>move from any point to the centre, as of fire contrariwise to move from 
<A NAME="907"></A>the centre to the extremity, it is impossible that any portion of earth 
<A NAME="908"></A>should move away from the centre except by constraint. For a single thing 
<A NAME="909"></A>has a single movement, and a simple thing a simple: contrary movements 
<A NAME="910"></A>cannot belong to the same thing, and movement away from the centre is the 
<A NAME="911"></A>contrary of movement to it. If then no portion of earth can move away from 
<A NAME="912"></A>the centre, obviously still less can the earth as a whole so move. For 
<A NAME="913"></A>it is the nature of the whole to move to the point to which the part naturally 
<A NAME="914"></A>moves. Since, then, it would require a force greater than itself to move 
<A NAME="915"></A>it, it must needs stay at the centre. This view is further supported by 
<A NAME="916"></A>the contributions of mathematicians to astronomy, since the observations 
<A NAME="917"></A>made as the shapes change by which the order of the stars is determined, 
<A NAME="918"></A>are fully accounted for on the hypothesis that the earth lies at the centre. 
<A NAME="919"></A>Of the position of the earth and of the manner of its rest or movement, 
<A NAME="920"></A>our discussion may here end.
<A NAME="921"></A><BR><BR>Its shape must necessarily be spherical. For every portion of earth 
<A NAME="922"></A>has weight until it reaches the centre, and the jostling of parts greater 
<A NAME="923"></A>and smaller would bring about not a waved surface, but rather compression 
<A NAME="924"></A>and convergence of part and part until the centre is reached. The process 
<A NAME="925"></A>should be conceived by supposing the earth to come into being in the way 
<A NAME="926"></A>that some of the natural philosophers describe. Only they attribute the 
<A NAME="927"></A>downward movement to constraint, and it is better to keep to the truth 
<A NAME="928"></A>and say that the reason of this motion is that a thing which possesses 
<A NAME="929"></A>weight is naturally endowed with a centripetal movement. When the mixture, 
<A NAME="930"></A>then, was merely potential, the things that were separated off moved similarly 
<A NAME="931"></A>from every side towards the centre. Whether the parts which came together 
<A NAME="932"></A>at the centre were distributed at the extremities evenly, or in some other 
<A NAME="933"></A>way, makes no difference. If, on the one hand, there were a similar movement 
<A NAME="934"></A>from each quarter of the extremity to the single centre, it is obvious 
<A NAME="935"></A>that the resulting mass would be similar on every side. For if an equal 
<A NAME="936"></A>amount is added on every side the extremity of the mass will be everywhere 
<A NAME="937"></A>equidistant from its centre, i.e. the figure will be spherical. But neither 
<A NAME="938"></A>will it in any way affect the argument if there is not a similar accession 
<A NAME="939"></A>of concurrent fragments from every side. For the greater quantity, finding 
<A NAME="940"></A>a lesser in front of it, must necessarily drive it on, both having an impulse 
<A NAME="941"></A>whose goal is the centre, and the greater weight driving the lesser forward 
<A NAME="942"></A>till this goal is reached. In this we have also the solution of a possible 
<A NAME="943"></A>difficulty. The earth, it might be argued, is at the centre and spherical 
<A NAME="944"></A>in shape: if, then, a weight many times that of the earth were added to 
<A NAME="945"></A>one hemisphere, the centre of the earth and of the whole will no longer 
<A NAME="946"></A>be coincident. So that either the earth will not stay still at the centre, 
<A NAME="947"></A>or if it does, it will be at rest without having its centre at the place 
<A NAME="948"></A>to which it is still its nature to move. Such is the difficulty. A short 
<A NAME="949"></A>consideration will give us an easy answer, if we first give precision to 
<A NAME="950"></A>our postulate that any body endowed with weight, of whatever size, moves 
<A NAME="951"></A>towards the centre. Clearly it will not stop when its edge touches the 
<A NAME="952"></A>centre. The greater quantity must prevail until the body's centre occupies 
<A NAME="953"></A>the centre. For that is the goal of its impulse. Now it makes no difference 
<A NAME="954"></A>whether we apply this to a clod or common fragment of earth or to the earth 
<A NAME="955"></A>as a whole. The fact indicated does not depend upon degrees of size but 
<A NAME="956"></A>applies universally to everything that has the centripetal impulse. Therefore 
<A NAME="957"></A>earth in motion, whether in a mass or in fragments, necessarily continues 
<A NAME="958"></A>to move until it occupies the centre equally every way, the less being 
<A NAME="959"></A>forced to equalize itself by the greater owing to the forward drive of 
<A NAME="960"></A>the impulse.
<A NAME="961"></A><BR><BR>If the earth was generated, then, it must have been formed in this 
<A NAME="962"></A>way, and so clearly its generation was spherical; and if it is ungenerated 
<A NAME="963"></A>and has remained so always, its character must be that which the initial 
<A NAME="964"></A>generation, if it had occurred, would have given it. But the spherical 
<A NAME="965"></A>shape, necessitated by this argument, follows also from the fact that the 
<A NAME="966"></A>motions of heavy bodies always make equal angles, and are not parallel. 
<A NAME="967"></A>This would be the natural form of movement towards what is naturally spherical. 
<A NAME="968"></A>Either then the earth is spherical or it is at least naturally spherical. 
<A NAME="969"></A>And it is right to call anything that which nature intends it to be, and 
<A NAME="970"></A>which belongs to it, rather than that which it is by constraint and contrary 
<A NAME="971"></A>to nature. The evidence of the senses further corroborates this. How else 
<A NAME="972"></A>would eclipses of the moon show segments shaped as we see them? As it is, 
<A NAME="973"></A>the shapes which the moon itself each month shows are of every kind straight, 
<A NAME="974"></A>gibbous, and concave-but in eclipses the outline is always curved: and, 
<A NAME="975"></A>since it is the interposition of the earth that makes the eclipse, the 
<A NAME="976"></A>form of this line will be caused by the form of the earth's surface, which 
<A NAME="977"></A>is therefore spherical. Again, our observations of the stars make it evident, 
<A NAME="978"></A>not only that the earth is circular, but also that it is a circle of no 
<A NAME="979"></A>great size. For quite a small change of position to south or north causes 
<A NAME="980"></A>a manifest alteration of the horizon. There is much change, I mean, in 
<A NAME="981"></A>the stars which are overhead, and the stars seen are different, as one 
<A NAME="982"></A>moves northward or southward. Indeed there are some stars seen in Egypt 
<A NAME="983"></A>and in the neighbourhood of Cyprus which are not seen in the northerly 
<A NAME="984"></A>regions; and stars, which in the north are never beyond the range of observation, 
<A NAME="985"></A>in those regions rise and set. All of which goes to show not only that 
<A NAME="986"></A>the earth is circular in shape, but also that it is a sphere of no great 
<A NAME="987"></A>size: for otherwise the effect of so slight a change of place would not 
<A NAME="988"></A>be quickly apparent. Hence one should not be too sure of the incredibility 
<A NAME="989"></A>of the view of those who conceive that there is continuity between the 
<A NAME="990"></A>parts about the pillars of Hercules and the parts about India, and that 
<A NAME="991"></A>in this way the ocean is one. As further evidence in favour of this they 
<A NAME="992"></A>quote the case of elephants, a species occurring in each of these extreme 
<A NAME="993"></A>regions, suggesting that the common characteristic of these extremes is 
<A NAME="994"></A>explained by their continuity. Also, those mathematicians who try to calculate 
<A NAME="995"></A>the size of the earth's circumference arrive at the figure 400,000 stades. 
<A NAME="996"></A>This indicates not only that the earth's mass is spherical in shape, but 
<A NAME="997"></A>also that as compared with the stars it is not of great 
<A NAME="998"></A>size.
