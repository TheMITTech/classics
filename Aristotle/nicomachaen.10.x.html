<A NAME="10"></A>1
<A NAME="11"></A><BR><BR>After these matters we ought perhaps next to discuss pleasure. 
<A NAME="12"></A>For it is thought to be most intimately connected with our human nature, 
<A NAME="13"></A>which is the reason why in educating the young we steer them by the rudders 
<A NAME="14"></A>of pleasure and pain; it is thought, too, that to enjoy the things we ought 
<A NAME="15"></A>and to hate the things we ought has the greatest bearing on virtue of character. 
<A NAME="16"></A>For these things extend right through life, with a weight and power of 
<A NAME="17"></A>their own in respect both to virtue and to the happy life, since men choose 
<A NAME="18"></A>what is pleasant and avoid what is painful; and such things, it will be 
<A NAME="19"></A>thought, we should least of all omit to discuss, especially since they 
<A NAME="20"></A>admit of much dispute. For some say pleasure is the good, while others, 
<A NAME="21"></A>on the contrary, say it is thoroughly bad-some no doubt being persuaded 
<A NAME="22"></A>that the facts are so, and others thinking it has a better effect on our 
<A NAME="23"></A>life to exhibit pleasure as a bad thing even if it is not; for most people 
<A NAME="24"></A>(they think) incline towards it and are the slaves of their pleasures, 
<A NAME="25"></A>for which reason they ought to lead them in the opposite direction, since 
<A NAME="26"></A>thus they will reach the middle state. But surely this is not correct. 
<A NAME="27"></A>For arguments about matters concerned with feelings and actions are less 
<A NAME="28"></A>reliable than facts: and so when they clash with the facts of perception 
<A NAME="29"></A>they are despised, and discredit the truth as well; if a man who runs down 
<A NAME="30"></A>pleasure is once seen to be alming at it, his inclining towards it is thought 
<A NAME="31"></A>to imply that it is all worthy of being aimed at; for most people are not 
<A NAME="32"></A>good at drawing distinctions. True arguments seem, then, most useful, not 
<A NAME="33"></A>only with a view to knowledge, but with a view to life also; for since 
<A NAME="34"></A>they harmonize with the facts they are believed, and so they stimulate 
<A NAME="35"></A>those who understand them to live according to them.-Enough of such questions; 
<A NAME="36"></A>let us proceed to review the opinions that have been expressed about 
<A NAME="37"></A>pleasure.
<A NAME="38"></A><BR><BR>2
<A NAME="39"></A><BR><BR>Eudoxus thought pleasure was the good because he saw all things, 
<A NAME="40"></A>both rational and irrational, aiming at it, and because in all things that 
<A NAME="41"></A>which is the object of choice is what is excellent, and that which is most 
<A NAME="42"></A>the object of choice the greatest good; thus the fact that all things moved 
<A NAME="43"></A>towards the same object indicated that this was for all things the chief 
<A NAME="44"></A>good (for each thing, he argued, finds its own good, as it finds its own 
<A NAME="45"></A>nourishment); and that which is good for all things and at which all aim 
<A NAME="46"></A>was the good. His arguments were credited more because of the excellence 
<A NAME="47"></A>of his character than for their own sake; he was thought to be remarkably 
<A NAME="48"></A>self-controlled, and therefore it was thought that he was not saying what 
<A NAME="49"></A>he did say as a friend of pleasure, but that the facts really were so. 
<A NAME="50"></A>He believed that the same conclusion followed no less plainly from a study 
<A NAME="51"></A>of the contrary of pleasure; pain was in itself an object of aversion to 
<A NAME="52"></A>all things, and therefore its contrary must be similarly an object of choice. 
<A NAME="53"></A>And again that is most an object of choice which we choose not because 
<A NAME="54"></A>or for the sake of something else, and pleasure is admittedly of this nature; 
<A NAME="55"></A>for no one asks to what end he is pleased, thus implying that pleasure 
<A NAME="56"></A>is in itself an object of choice. Further, he argued that pleasure when 
<A NAME="57"></A>added to any good, e.g. to just or temperate action, makes it more worthy 
<A NAME="58"></A>of choice, and that it is only by itself that the good can be 
<A NAME="59"></A>increased.
<A NAME="60"></A><BR><BR>This argument seems to show it to be one of the goods, and no more 
<A NAME="61"></A>a good than any other; for every good is more worthy of choice along with 
<A NAME="62"></A>another good than taken alone. And so it is by an argument of this kind 
<A NAME="63"></A>that Plato proves the good not to be pleasure; he argues that the pleasant 
<A NAME="64"></A>life is more desirable with wisdom than without, and that if the mixture 
<A NAME="65"></A>is better, pleasure is not the good; for the good cannot become more desirable 
<A NAME="66"></A>by the addition of anything to it. Now it is clear that nothing else, any 
<A NAME="67"></A>more than pleasure, can be the good if it is made more desirable by the 
<A NAME="68"></A>addition of any of the things that are good in themselves. What, then, 
<A NAME="69"></A>is there that satisfies this criterion, which at the same time we can participate 
<A NAME="70"></A>in? It is something of this sort that we are looking for. Those who object 
<A NAME="71"></A>that that at which all things aim is not necessarily good are, we may surmise, 
<A NAME="72"></A>talking nonsense. For we say that that which every one thinks really is 
<A NAME="73"></A>so; and the man who attacks this belief will hardly have anything more 
<A NAME="74"></A>credible to maintain instead. If it is senseless creatures that desire 
<A NAME="75"></A>the things in question, there might be something in what they say; but 
<A NAME="76"></A>if intelligent creatures do so as well, what sense can there be in this 
<A NAME="77"></A>view? But perhaps even in inferior creatures there is some natural good 
<A NAME="78"></A>stronger than themselves which aims at their proper 
<A NAME="79"></A>good.
<A NAME="80"></A><BR><BR>Nor does the argument about the contrary of pleasure seem to be 
<A NAME="81"></A>correct. They say that if pain is an evil it does not follow that pleasure 
<A NAME="82"></A>is a good; for evil is opposed to evil and at the same time both are opposed 
<A NAME="83"></A>to the neutral state-which is correct enough but does not apply to the 
<A NAME="84"></A>things in question. For if both pleasure and pain belonged to the class 
<A NAME="85"></A>of evils they ought both to be objects of aversion, while if they belonged 
<A NAME="86"></A>to the class of neutrals neither should be an object of aversion or they 
<A NAME="87"></A>should both be equally so; but in fact people evidently avoid the one as 
<A NAME="88"></A>evil and choose the other as good; that then must be the nature of the 
<A NAME="89"></A>opposition between them.
<A NAME="90"></A><BR><BR>3
<A NAME="91"></A><BR><BR>Nor again, if pleasure is not a quality, does it follow that it 
<A NAME="92"></A>is not a good; for the activities of virtue are not qualities either, nor 
<A NAME="93"></A>is happiness. They say, however, that the good is determinate, while pleasure 
<A NAME="94"></A>is indeterminate, because it admits of degrees. Now if it is from the feeling 
<A NAME="95"></A>of pleasure that they judge thus, the same will be true of justice and 
<A NAME="96"></A>the other virtues, in respect of which we plainly say that people of a 
<A NAME="97"></A>certain character are so more or less, and act more or less in accordance 
<A NAME="98"></A>with these virtues; for people may be more just or brave, and it is possible 
<A NAME="99"></A>also to act justly or temperately more or less. But if their judgement 
<A NAME="100"></A>is based on the various pleasures, surely they are not stating the real 
<A NAME="101"></A>cause, if in fact some pleasures are unmixed and others mixed. Again, just 
<A NAME="102"></A>as health admits of degrees without being indeterminate, why should not 
<A NAME="103"></A>pleasure? The same proportion is not found in all things, nor a single 
<A NAME="104"></A>proportion always in the same thing, but it may be relaxed and yet persist 
<A NAME="105"></A>up to a point, and it may differ in degree. The case of pleasure also may 
<A NAME="106"></A>therefore be of this kind.
<A NAME="107"></A><BR><BR>Again, they assume that the good is perfect while movements and 
<A NAME="108"></A>comings into being are imperfect, and try to exhibit pleasure as being 
<A NAME="109"></A>a movement and a coming into being. But they do not seem to be right even 
<A NAME="110"></A>in saying that it is a movement. For speed and slowness are thought to 
<A NAME="111"></A>be proper to every movement, and if a movement, e.g. that of the heavens, 
<A NAME="112"></A>has not speed or slowness in itself, it has it in relation to something 
<A NAME="113"></A>else; but of pleasure neither of these things is true. For while we may 
<A NAME="114"></A>become pleased quickly as we may become angry quickly, we cannot be pleased 
<A NAME="115"></A>quickly, not even in relation to some one else, while we can walk, or grow, 
<A NAME="116"></A>or the like, quickly. While, then, we can change quickly or slowly into 
<A NAME="117"></A>a state of pleasure, we cannot quickly exhibit the activity of pleasure, 
<A NAME="118"></A>i.e. be pleased. Again, how can it be a coming into being? It is not thought 
<A NAME="119"></A>that any chance thing can come out of any chance thing, but that a thing 
<A NAME="120"></A>is dissolved into that out of which it comes into being; and pain would 
<A NAME="121"></A>be the destruction of that of which pleasure is the coming into 
<A NAME="122"></A>being.
<A NAME="123"></A><BR><BR>They say, too, that pain is the lack of that which is according 
<A NAME="124"></A>to nature, and pleasure is replenishment. But these experiences are bodily. 
<A NAME="125"></A>If then pleasure is replenishment with that which is according to nature, 
<A NAME="126"></A>that which feels pleasure will be that in which the replenishment takes 
<A NAME="127"></A>place, i.e. the body; but that is not thought to be the case; therefore 
<A NAME="128"></A>the replenishment is not pleasure, though one would be pleased when replenishment 
<A NAME="129"></A>was taking place, just as one would be pained if one was being operated 
<A NAME="130"></A>on. This opinion seems to be based on the pains and pleasures connected 
<A NAME="131"></A>with nutrition; on the fact that when people have been short of food and 
<A NAME="132"></A>have felt pain beforehand they are pleased by the replenishment. But this 
<A NAME="133"></A>does not happen with all pleasures; for the pleasures of learning and, 
<A NAME="134"></A>among the sensuous pleasures, those of smell, and also many sounds and 
<A NAME="135"></A>sights, and memories and hopes, do not presuppose pain. Of what then will 
<A NAME="136"></A>these be the coming into being? There has not been lack of anything of 
<A NAME="137"></A>which they could be the supplying anew.
<A NAME="138"></A><BR><BR>In reply to those who bring forward the disgraceful pleasures one 
<A NAME="139"></A>may say that these are not pleasant; if things are pleasant to people of 
<A NAME="140"></A>vicious constitution, we must not suppose that they are also pleasant to 
<A NAME="141"></A>others than these, just as we do not reason so about the things that are 
<A NAME="142"></A>wholesome or sweet or bitter to sick people, or ascribe whiteness to the 
<A NAME="143"></A>things that seem white to those suffering from a disease of the eye. Or 
<A NAME="144"></A>one might answer thus-that the pleasures are desirable, but not from these 
<A NAME="145"></A>sources, as wealth is desirable, but not as the reward of betrayal, and 
<A NAME="146"></A>health, but not at the cost of eating anything and everything. Or perhaps 
<A NAME="147"></A>pleasures differ in kind; for those derived from noble sources are different 
<A NAME="148"></A>from those derived from base sources, and one cannot the pleasure of the 
<A NAME="149"></A>just man without being just, nor that of the musical man without being 
<A NAME="150"></A>musical, and so on.
<A NAME="151"></A><BR><BR>The fact, too, that a friend is different from a flatterer seems 
<A NAME="152"></A>to make it plain that pleasure is not a good or that pleasures are different 
<A NAME="153"></A>in kind; for the one is thought to consort with us with a view to the good, 
<A NAME="154"></A>the other with a view to our pleasure, and the one is reproached for his 
<A NAME="155"></A>conduct while the other is praised on the ground that he consorts with 
<A NAME="156"></A>us for different ends. And no one would choose to live with the intellect 
<A NAME="157"></A>of a child throughout his life, however much he were to be pleased at the 
<A NAME="158"></A>things that children are pleased at, nor to get enjoyment by doing some 
<A NAME="159"></A>most disgraceful deed, though he were never to feel any pain in consequence. 
<A NAME="160"></A>And there are many things we should be keen about even if they brought 
<A NAME="161"></A>no pleasure, e.g. seeing, remembering, knowing, possessing the virtues. 
<A NAME="162"></A>If pleasures necessarily do accompany these, that makes no odds; we should 
<A NAME="163"></A>choose these even if no pleasure resulted. It seems to be clear, then, 
<A NAME="164"></A>that neither is pleasure the good nor is all pleasure desirable, and that 
<A NAME="165"></A>some pleasures are desirable in themselves, differing in kind or in their 
<A NAME="166"></A>sources from the others. So much for the things that are said about pleasure 
<A NAME="167"></A>and pain.
<A NAME="168"></A><BR><BR>4
<A NAME="169"></A><BR><BR>What pleasure is, or what kind of thing it is, will become plainer 
<A NAME="170"></A>if we take up the question aga from the beginning. Seeing seems to be at 
<A NAME="171"></A>any moment complete, for it does not lack anything which coming into being 
<A NAME="172"></A>later will complete its form; and pleasure also seems to be of this nature. 
<A NAME="173"></A>For it is a whole, and at no time can one find a pleasure whose form will 
<A NAME="174"></A>be completed if the pleasure lasts longer. For this reason, too, it is 
<A NAME="175"></A>not a movement. For every movement (e.g. that of building) takes time and 
<A NAME="176"></A>is for the sake of an end, and is complete when it has made what it aims 
<A NAME="177"></A>at. It is complete, therefore, only in the whole time or at that final 
<A NAME="178"></A>moment. In their parts and during the time they occupy, all movements are 
<A NAME="179"></A>incomplete, and are different in kind from the whole movement and from 
<A NAME="180"></A>each other. For the fitting together of the stones is different from the 
<A NAME="181"></A>fluting of the column, and these are both different from the making of 
<A NAME="182"></A>the temple; and the making of the temple is complete (for it lacks nothing 
<A NAME="183"></A>with a view to the end proposed), but the making of the base or of the 
<A NAME="184"></A>triglyph is incomplete; for each is the making of only a part. They differ 
<A NAME="185"></A>in kind, then, and it is not possible to find at any and every time a movement 
<A NAME="186"></A>complete in form, but if at all, only in the whole time. So, too, in the 
<A NAME="187"></A>case of walking and all other movements. For if locomotion is a movement 
<A NAME="188"></A>from to there, it, too, has differences in kind-flying, walking, leaping, 
<A NAME="189"></A>and so on. And not only so, but in walking itself there are such differences; 
<A NAME="190"></A>for the whence and whither are not the same in the whole racecourse and 
<A NAME="191"></A>in a part of it, nor in one part and in another, nor is it the same thing 
<A NAME="192"></A>to traverse this line and that; for one traverses not only a line but one 
<A NAME="193"></A>which is in a place, and this one is in a different place from that. We 
<A NAME="194"></A>have discussed movement with precision in another work, but it seems that 
<A NAME="195"></A>it is not complete at any and every time, but that the many movements are 
<A NAME="196"></A>incomplete and different in kind, since the whence and whither give them 
<A NAME="197"></A>their form. But of pleasure the form is complete at any and every time. 
<A NAME="198"></A>Plainly, then, pleasure and movement must be different from each other, 
<A NAME="199"></A>and pleasure must be one of the things that are whole and complete. This 
<A NAME="200"></A>would seem to be the case, too, from the fact that it is not possible to 
<A NAME="201"></A>move otherwise than in time, but it is possible to be pleased; for that 
<A NAME="202"></A>which takes place in a moment is a whole.
<A NAME="203"></A><BR><BR>From these considerations it is clear, too, that these thinkers 
<A NAME="204"></A>are not right in saying there is a movement or a coming into being of pleasure. 
<A NAME="205"></A>For these cannot be ascribed to all things, but only to those that are 
<A NAME="206"></A>divisible and not wholes; there is no coming into being of seeing nor of 
<A NAME="207"></A>a point nor of a unit, nor is any of these a movement or coming into being; 
<A NAME="208"></A>therefore there is no movement or coming into being of pleasure either; 
<A NAME="209"></A>for it is a whole.
<A NAME="210"></A><BR><BR>Since every sense is active in relation to its object, and a sense 
<A NAME="211"></A>which is in good condition acts perfectly in relation to the most beautiful 
<A NAME="212"></A>of its objects (for perfect activity seems to be ideally of this nature; 
<A NAME="213"></A>whether we say that it is active, or the organ in which it resides, may 
<A NAME="214"></A>be assumed to be immaterial), it follows that in the case of each sense 
<A NAME="215"></A>the best activity is that of the best-conditioned organ in relation to 
<A NAME="216"></A>the finest of its objects. And this activity will be the most complete 
<A NAME="217"></A>and pleasant. For, while there is pleasure in respect of any sense, and 
<A NAME="218"></A>in respect of thought and contemplation no less, the most complete is pleasantest, 
<A NAME="219"></A>and that of a well-conditioned organ in relation to the worthiest of its 
<A NAME="220"></A>objects is the most complete; and the pleasure completes the activity. 
<A NAME="221"></A>But the pleasure does not complete it in the same way as the combination 
<A NAME="222"></A>of object and sense, both good, just as health and the doctor are not in 
<A NAME="223"></A>the same way the cause of a man's being healthy. (That pleasure is produced 
<A NAME="224"></A>in respect to each sense is plain; for we speak of sights and sounds as 
<A NAME="225"></A>pleasant. It is also plain that it arises most of all when both the sense 
<A NAME="226"></A>is at its best and it is active in reference to an object which corresponds; 
<A NAME="227"></A>when both object and perceiver are of the best there will always be pleasure, 
<A NAME="228"></A>since the requisite agent and patient are both present.) Pleasure completes 
<A NAME="229"></A>the activity not as the corresponding permanent state does, by its immanence, 
<A NAME="230"></A>but as an end which supervenes as the bloom of youth does on those in the 
<A NAME="231"></A>flower of their age. So long, then, as both the intelligible or sensible 
<A NAME="232"></A>object and the discriminating or contemplative faculty are as they should 
<A NAME="233"></A>be, the pleasure will be involved in the activity; for when both the passive 
<A NAME="234"></A>and the active factor are unchanged and are related to each other in the 
<A NAME="235"></A>same way, the same result naturally follows.
<A NAME="236"></A><BR><BR>How, then, is it that no one is continuously pleased? Is it that 
<A NAME="237"></A>we grow weary? Certainly all human beings are incapable of continuous activity. 
<A NAME="238"></A>Therefore pleasure also is not continuous; for it accompanies activity. 
<A NAME="239"></A>Some things delight us when they are new, but later do so less, for the 
<A NAME="240"></A>same reason; for at first the mind is in a state of stimulation and intensely 
<A NAME="241"></A>active about them, as people are with respect to their vision when they 
<A NAME="242"></A>look hard at a thing, but afterwards our activity is not of this kind, 
<A NAME="243"></A>but has grown relaxed; for which reason the pleasure also is 
<A NAME="244"></A>dulled.
<A NAME="245"></A><BR><BR>One might think that all men desire pleasure because they all aim 
<A NAME="246"></A>at life; life is an activity, and each man is active about those things 
<A NAME="247"></A>and with those faculties that he loves most; e.g. the musician is active 
<A NAME="248"></A>with his hearing in reference to tunes, the student with his mind in reference 
<A NAME="249"></A>to theoretical questions, and so on in each case; now pleasure completes 
<A NAME="250"></A>the activities, and therefore life, which they desire. It is with good 
<A NAME="251"></A>reason, then, that they aim at pleasure too, since for every one it completes 
<A NAME="252"></A>life, which is desirable. But whether we choose life for the sake of pleasure 
<A NAME="253"></A>or pleasure for the sake of life is a question we may dismiss for the present. 
<A NAME="254"></A>For they seem to be bound up together and not to admit of separation, since 
<A NAME="255"></A>without activity pleasure does not arise, and every activity is completed 
<A NAME="256"></A>by the attendant pleasure.
<A NAME="257"></A><BR><BR>5
<A NAME="258"></A><BR><BR>For this reason pleasures seem, too, to differ in kind. For things 
<A NAME="259"></A>different in kind are, we think, completed by different things (we see 
<A NAME="260"></A>this to be true both of natural objects and of things produced by art, 
<A NAME="261"></A>e.g. animals, trees, a painting, a sculpture, a house, an implement); and, 
<A NAME="262"></A>similarly, we think that activities differing in kind are completed by 
<A NAME="263"></A>things differing in kind. Now the activities of thought differ from those 
<A NAME="264"></A>of the senses, and both differ among themselves, in kind; so, therefore, 
<A NAME="265"></A>do the pleasures that complete them.
<A NAME="266"></A><BR><BR>This may be seen, too, from the fact that each of the pleasures 
<A NAME="267"></A>is bound up with the activity it completes. For an activity is intensified 
<A NAME="268"></A>by its proper pleasure, since each class of things is better judged of 
<A NAME="269"></A>and brought to precision by those who engage in the activity with pleasure; 
<A NAME="270"></A>e.g. it is those who enjoy geometrical thinking that become geometers and 
<A NAME="271"></A>grasp the various propositions better, and, similarly, those who are fond 
<A NAME="272"></A>of music or of building, and so on, make progress in their proper function 
<A NAME="273"></A>by enjoying it; so the pleasures intensify the activities, and what intensifies 
<A NAME="274"></A>a thing is proper to it, but things different in kind have properties different 
<A NAME="275"></A>in kind.
<A NAME="276"></A><BR><BR>This will be even more apparent from the fact that activities are 
<A NAME="277"></A>hindered by pleasures arising from other sources. For people who are fond 
<A NAME="278"></A>of playing the flute are incapable of attending to arguments if they overhear 
<A NAME="279"></A>some one playing the flute, since they enjoy flute-playing more than the 
<A NAME="280"></A>activity in hand; so the pleasure connected with fluteplaying destroys 
<A NAME="281"></A>the activity concerned with argument. This happens, similarly, in all other 
<A NAME="282"></A>cases, when one is active about two things at once; the more pleasant activity 
<A NAME="283"></A>drives out the other, and if it is much more pleasant does so all the more, 
<A NAME="284"></A>so that one even ceases from the other. This is why when we enjoy anything 
<A NAME="285"></A>very much we do not throw ourselves into anything else, and do one thing 
<A NAME="286"></A>only when we are not much pleased by another; e.g. in the theatre the people 
<A NAME="287"></A>who eat sweets do so most when the actors are poor. Now since activities 
<A NAME="288"></A>are made precise and more enduring and better by their proper pleasure, 
<A NAME="289"></A>and injured by alien pleasures, evidently the two kinds of pleasure are 
<A NAME="290"></A>far apart. For alien pleasures do pretty much what proper pains do, since 
<A NAME="291"></A>activities are destroyed by their proper pains; e.g. if a man finds writing 
<A NAME="292"></A>or doing sums unpleasant and painful, he does not write, or does not do 
<A NAME="293"></A>sums, because the activity is painful. So an activity suffers contrary 
<A NAME="294"></A>effects from its proper pleasures and pains, i.e. from those that supervene 
<A NAME="295"></A>on it in virtue of its own nature. And alien pleasures have been stated 
<A NAME="296"></A>to do much the same as pain; they destroy the activity, only not to the 
<A NAME="297"></A>same degree.
<A NAME="298"></A><BR><BR>Now since activities differ in respect of goodness and badness, 
<A NAME="299"></A>and some are worthy to be chosen, others to be avoided, and others neutral, 
<A NAME="300"></A>so, too, are the pleasures; for to each activity there is a proper pleasure. 
<A NAME="301"></A>The pleasure proper to a worthy activity is good and that proper to an 
<A NAME="302"></A>unworthy activity bad; just as the appetites for noble objects are laudable, 
<A NAME="303"></A>those for base objects culpable. But the pleasures involved in activities 
<A NAME="304"></A>are more proper to them than the desires; for the latter are separated 
<A NAME="305"></A>both in time and in nature, while the former are close to the activities, 
<A NAME="306"></A>and so hard to distinguish from them that it admits of dispute whether 
<A NAME="307"></A>the activity is not the same as the pleasure. (Still, pleasure does not 
<A NAME="308"></A>seem to be thought or perception-that would be strange; but because they 
<A NAME="309"></A>are not found apart they appear to some people the same.) As activities 
<A NAME="310"></A>are different, then, so are the corresponding pleasures. Now sight is superior 
<A NAME="311"></A>to touch in purity, and hearing and smell to taste; the pleasures, therefore, 
<A NAME="312"></A>are similarly superior, and those of thought superior to these, and within 
<A NAME="313"></A>each of the two kinds some are superior to others.
<A NAME="314"></A><BR><BR>Each animal is thought to have a proper pleasure, as it has a proper 
<A NAME="315"></A>function; viz. that which corresponds to its activity. If we survey them 
<A NAME="316"></A>species by species, too, this will be evident; horse, dog, and man have 
<A NAME="317"></A>different pleasures, as Heraclitus says 'asses would prefer sweepings to 
<A NAME="318"></A>gold'; for food is pleasanter than gold to asses. So the pleasures of creatures 
<A NAME="319"></A>different in kind differ in kind, and it is plausible to suppose that those 
<A NAME="320"></A>of a single species do not differ. But they vary to no small extent, in 
<A NAME="321"></A>the case of men at least; the same things delight some people and pain 
<A NAME="322"></A>others, and are painful and odious to some, and pleasant to and liked by 
<A NAME="323"></A>others. This happens, too, in the case of sweet things; the same things 
<A NAME="324"></A>do not seem sweet to a man in a fever and a healthy man-nor hot to a weak 
<A NAME="325"></A>man and one in good condition. The same happens in other cases. But in 
<A NAME="326"></A>all such matters that which appears to the good man is thought to be really 
<A NAME="327"></A>so. If this is correct, as it seems to be, and virtue and the good man 
<A NAME="328"></A>as such are the measure of each thing, those also will be pleasures which 
<A NAME="329"></A>appear so to him, and those things pleasant which he enjoys. If the things 
<A NAME="330"></A>he finds tiresome seem pleasant to some one, that is nothing surprising; 
<A NAME="331"></A>for men may be ruined and spoilt in many ways; but the things are not pleasant, 
<A NAME="332"></A>but only pleasant to these people and to people in this condition. Those 
<A NAME="333"></A>which are admittedly disgraceful plainly should not be said to be pleasures, 
<A NAME="334"></A>except to a perverted taste; but of those that are thought to be good what 
<A NAME="335"></A>kind of pleasure or what pleasure should be said to be that proper to man? 
<A NAME="336"></A>Is it not plain from the corresponding activities? The pleasures follow 
<A NAME="337"></A>these. Whether, then, the perfect and supremely happy man has one or more 
<A NAME="338"></A>activities, the pleasures that perfect these will be said in the strict 
<A NAME="339"></A>sense to be pleasures proper to man, and the rest will be so in a secondary 
<A NAME="340"></A>and fractional way, as are the activities.
<A NAME="341"></A><BR><BR>6
<A NAME="342"></A><BR><BR>Now that we have spoken of the virtues, the forms of friendship, 
<A NAME="343"></A>and the varieties of pleasure, what remains is to discuss in outline the 
<A NAME="344"></A>nature of happiness, since this is what we state the end of human nature 
<A NAME="345"></A>to be. Our discussion will be the more concise if we first sum up what 
<A NAME="346"></A>we have said already. We said, then, that it is not a disposition; for 
<A NAME="347"></A>if it were it might belong to some one who was asleep throughout his life, 
<A NAME="348"></A>living the life of a plant, or, again, to some one who was suffering the 
<A NAME="349"></A>greatest misfortunes. If these implications are unacceptable, and we must 
<A NAME="350"></A>rather class happiness as an activity, as we have said before, and if some 
<A NAME="351"></A>activities are necessary, and desirable for the sake of something else, 
<A NAME="352"></A>while others are so in themselves, evidently happiness must be placed among 
<A NAME="353"></A>those desirable in themselves, not among those desirable for the sake of 
<A NAME="354"></A>something else; for happiness does not lack anything, but is self-sufficient. 
<A NAME="355"></A>Now those activities are desirable in themselves from which nothing is 
<A NAME="356"></A>sought beyond the activity. And of this nature virtuous actions are thought 
<A NAME="357"></A>to be; for to do noble and good deeds is a thing desirable for its own 
<A NAME="358"></A>sake.
<A NAME="359"></A><BR><BR>Pleasant amusements also are thought to be of this nature; we choose 
<A NAME="360"></A>them not for the sake of other things; for we are injured rather than benefited 
<A NAME="361"></A>by them, since we are led to neglect our bodies and our property. But most 
<A NAME="362"></A>of the people who are deemed happy take refuge in such pastimes, which 
<A NAME="363"></A>is the reason why those who are ready-witted at them are highly esteemed 
<A NAME="364"></A>at the courts of tyrants; they make themselves pleasant companions in the 
<A NAME="365"></A>tyrants' favourite pursuits, and that is the sort of man they want. Now 
<A NAME="366"></A>these things are thought to be of the nature of happiness because people 
<A NAME="367"></A>in despotic positions spend their leisure in them, but perhaps such people 
<A NAME="368"></A>prove nothing; for virtue and reason, from which good activities flow, 
<A NAME="369"></A>do not depend on despotic position; nor, if these people, who have never 
<A NAME="370"></A>tasted pure and generous pleasure, take refuge in the bodily pleasures, 
<A NAME="371"></A>should these for that reason be thought more desirable; for boys, too, 
<A NAME="372"></A>think the things that are valued among themselves are the best. It is to 
<A NAME="373"></A>be expected, then, that, as different things seem valuable to boys and 
<A NAME="374"></A>to men, so they should to bad men and to good. Now, as we have often maintained, 
<A NAME="375"></A>those things are both valuable and pleasant which are such to the good 
<A NAME="376"></A>man; and to each man the activity in accordance with his own disposition 
<A NAME="377"></A>is most desirable, and, therefore, to the good man that which is in accordance 
<A NAME="378"></A>with virtue. Happiness, therefore, does not lie in amusement; it would, 
<A NAME="379"></A>indeed, be strange if the end were amusement, and one were to take trouble 
<A NAME="380"></A>and suffer hardship all one's life in order to amuse oneself. For, in a 
<A NAME="381"></A>word, everything that we choose we choose for the sake of something else-except 
<A NAME="382"></A>happiness, which is an end. Now to exert oneself and work for the sake 
<A NAME="383"></A>of amusement seems silly and utterly childish. But to amuse oneself in 
<A NAME="384"></A>order that one may exert oneself, as Anacharsis puts it, seems right; for 
<A NAME="385"></A>amusement is a sort of relaxation, and we need relaxation because we cannot 
<A NAME="386"></A>work continuously. Relaxation, then, is not an end; for it is taken for 
<A NAME="387"></A>the sake of activity.
<A NAME="388"></A><BR><BR>The happy life is thought to be virtuous; now a virtuous life requires 
<A NAME="389"></A>exertion, and does not consist in amusement. And we say that serious things 
<A NAME="390"></A>are better than laughable things and those connected with amusement, and 
<A NAME="391"></A>that the activity of the better of any two things-whether it be two elements 
<A NAME="392"></A>of our being or two men-is the more serious; but the activity of the better 
<A NAME="393"></A>is ipso facto superior and more of the nature of happiness. And any chance 
<A NAME="394"></A>person-even a slave-can enjoy the bodily pleasures no less than the best 
<A NAME="395"></A>man; but no one assigns to a slave a share in happiness-unless he assigns 
<A NAME="396"></A>to him also a share in human life. For happiness does not lie in such occupations, 
<A NAME="397"></A>but, as we have said before, in virtuous activities.
<A NAME="398"></A><BR><BR>7
<A NAME="399"></A><BR><BR>If happiness is activity in accordance with virtue, it is reasonable 
<A NAME="400"></A>that it should be in accordance with the highest virtue; and this will 
<A NAME="401"></A>be that of the best thing in us. Whether it be reason or something else 
<A NAME="402"></A>that is this element which is thought to be our natural ruler and guide 
<A NAME="403"></A>and to take thought of things noble and divine, whether it be itself also 
<A NAME="404"></A>divine or only the most divine element in us, the activity of this in accordance 
<A NAME="405"></A>with its proper virtue will be perfect happiness. That this activity is 
<A NAME="406"></A>contemplative we have already said.
<A NAME="407"></A><BR><BR>Now this would seem to be in agreement both with what we said before 
<A NAME="408"></A>and with the truth. For, firstly, this activity is the best (since not 
<A NAME="409"></A>only is reason the best thing in us, but the objects of reason are the 
<A NAME="410"></A>best of knowable objects); and secondly, it is the most continuous, since 
<A NAME="411"></A>we can contemplate truth more continuously than we can do anything. And 
<A NAME="412"></A>we think happiness has pleasure mingled with it, but the activity of philosophic 
<A NAME="413"></A>wisdom is admittedly the pleasantest of virtuous activities; at all events 
<A NAME="414"></A>the pursuit of it is thought to offer pleasures marvellous for their purity 
<A NAME="415"></A>and their enduringness, and it is to be expected that those who know will 
<A NAME="416"></A>pass their time more pleasantly than those who inquire. And the self-sufficiency 
<A NAME="417"></A>that is spoken of must belong most to the contemplative activity. For while 
<A NAME="418"></A>a philosopher, as well as a just man or one possessing any other virtue, 
<A NAME="419"></A>needs the necessaries of life, when they are sufficiently equipped with 
<A NAME="420"></A>things of that sort the just man needs people towards whom and with whom 
<A NAME="421"></A>he shall act justly, and the temperate man, the brave man, and each of 
<A NAME="422"></A>the others is in the same case, but the philosopher, even when by himself, 
<A NAME="423"></A>can contemplate truth, and the better the wiser he is; he can perhaps do 
<A NAME="424"></A>so better if he has fellow-workers, but still he is the most self-sufficient. 
<A NAME="425"></A>And this activity alone would seem to be loved for its own sake; for nothing 
<A NAME="426"></A>arises from it apart from the contemplating, while from practical activities 
<A NAME="427"></A>we gain more or less apart from the action. And happiness is thought to 
<A NAME="428"></A>depend on leisure; for we are busy that we may have leisure, and make war 
<A NAME="429"></A>that we may live in peace. Now the activity of the practical virtues is 
<A NAME="430"></A>exhibited in political or military affairs, but the actions concerned with 
<A NAME="431"></A>these seem to be unleisurely. Warlike actions are completely so (for no 
<A NAME="432"></A>one chooses to be at war, or provokes war, for the sake of being at war; 
<A NAME="433"></A>any one would seem absolutely murderous if he were to make enemies of his 
<A NAME="434"></A>friends in order to bring about battle and slaughter); but the action of 
<A NAME="435"></A>the statesman is also unleisurely, and-apart from the political action 
<A NAME="436"></A>itself-aims at despotic power and honours, or at all events happiness, 
<A NAME="437"></A>for him and his fellow citizens-a happiness different from political action, 
<A NAME="438"></A>and evidently sought as being different. So if among virtuous actions political 
<A NAME="439"></A>and military actions are distinguished by nobility and greatness, and these 
<A NAME="440"></A>are unleisurely and aim at an end and are not desirable for their own sake, 
<A NAME="441"></A>but the activity of reason, which is contemplative, seems both to be superior 
<A NAME="442"></A>in serious worth and to aim at no end beyond itself, and to have its pleasure 
<A NAME="443"></A>proper to itself (and this augments the activity), and the self-sufficiency, 
<A NAME="444"></A>leisureliness, unweariedness (so far as this is possible for man), and 
<A NAME="445"></A>all the other attributes ascribed to the supremely happy man are evidently 
<A NAME="446"></A>those connected with this activity, it follows that this will be the complete 
<A NAME="447"></A>happiness of man, if it be allowed a complete term of life (for none of 
<A NAME="448"></A>the attributes of happiness is incomplete).
<A NAME="449"></A><BR><BR>But such a life would be too high for man; for it is not in so 
<A NAME="450"></A>far as he is man that he will live so, but in so far as something divine 
<A NAME="451"></A>is present in him; and by so much as this is superior to our composite 
<A NAME="452"></A>nature is its activity superior to that which is the exercise of the other 
<A NAME="453"></A>kind of virtue. If reason is divine, then, in comparison with man, the 
<A NAME="454"></A>life according to it is divine in comparison with human life. But we must 
<A NAME="455"></A>not follow those who advise us, being men, to think of human things, and, 
<A NAME="456"></A>being mortal, of mortal things, but must, so far as we can, make ourselves 
<A NAME="457"></A>immortal, and strain every nerve to live in accordance with the best thing 
<A NAME="458"></A>in us; for even if it be small in bulk, much more does it in power and 
<A NAME="459"></A>worth surpass everything. This would seem, too, to be each man himself, 
<A NAME="460"></A>since it is the authoritative and better part of him. It would be strange, 
<A NAME="461"></A>then, if he were to choose not the life of his self but that of something 
<A NAME="462"></A>else. And what we said before' will apply now; that which is proper to 
<A NAME="463"></A>each thing is by nature best and most pleasant for each thing; for man, 
<A NAME="464"></A>therefore, the life according to reason is best and pleasantest, since 
<A NAME="465"></A>reason more than anything else is man. This life therefore is also the 
<A NAME="466"></A>happiest.
<A NAME="467"></A><BR><BR>8
<A NAME="468"></A><BR><BR>But in a secondary degree the life in accordance with the other 
<A NAME="469"></A>kind of virtue is happy; for the activities in accordance with this befit 
<A NAME="470"></A>our human estate. Just and brave acts, and other virtuous acts, we do in 
<A NAME="471"></A>relation to each other, observing our respective duties with regard to 
<A NAME="472"></A>contracts and services and all manner of actions and with regard to passions; 
<A NAME="473"></A>and all of these seem to be typically human. Some of them seem even to 
<A NAME="474"></A>arise from the body, and virtue of character to be in many ways bound up 
<A NAME="475"></A>with the passions. Practical wisdom, too, is linked to virtue of character, 
<A NAME="476"></A>and this to practical wisdom, since the principles of practical wisdom 
<A NAME="477"></A>are in accordance with the moral virtues and rightness in morals is in 
<A NAME="478"></A>accordance with practical wisdom. Being connected with the passions also, 
<A NAME="479"></A>the moral virtues must belong to our composite nature; and the virtues 
<A NAME="480"></A>of our composite nature are human; so, therefore, are the life and the 
<A NAME="481"></A>happiness which correspond to these. The excellence of the reason is a 
<A NAME="482"></A>thing apart; we must be content to say this much about it, for to describe 
<A NAME="483"></A>it precisely is a task greater than our purpose requires. It would seem, 
<A NAME="484"></A>however, also to need external equipment but little, or less than moral 
<A NAME="485"></A>virtue does. Grant that both need the necessaries, and do so equally, even 
<A NAME="486"></A>if the statesman's work is the more concerned with the body and things 
<A NAME="487"></A>of that sort; for there will be little difference there; but in what they 
<A NAME="488"></A>need for the exercise of their activities there will be much difference. 
<A NAME="489"></A>The liberal man will need money for the doing of his liberal deeds, and 
<A NAME="490"></A>the just man too will need it for the returning of services (for wishes 
<A NAME="491"></A>are hard to discern, and even people who are not just pretend to wish to 
<A NAME="492"></A>act justly); and the brave man will need power if he is to accomplish any 
<A NAME="493"></A>of the acts that correspond to his virtue, and the temperate man will need 
<A NAME="494"></A>opportunity; for how else is either he or any of the others to be recognized? 
<A NAME="495"></A>It is debated, too, whether the will or the deed is more essential to virtue, 
<A NAME="496"></A>which is assumed to involve both; it is surely clear that its perfection 
<A NAME="497"></A>involves both; but for deeds many things are needed, and more, the greater 
<A NAME="498"></A>and nobler the deeds are. But the man who is contemplating the truth needs 
<A NAME="499"></A>no such thing, at least with a view to the exercise of his activity; indeed 
<A NAME="500"></A>they are, one may say, even hindrances, at all events to his contemplation; 
<A NAME="501"></A>but in so far as he is a man and lives with a number of people, he chooses 
<A NAME="502"></A>to do virtuous acts; he will therefore need such aids to living a human 
<A NAME="503"></A>life.
<A NAME="504"></A><BR><BR>But that perfect happiness is a contemplative activity will appear 
<A NAME="505"></A>from the following consideration as well. We assume the gods to be above 
<A NAME="506"></A>all other beings blessed and happy; but what sort of actions must we assign 
<A NAME="507"></A>to them? Acts of justice? Will not the gods seem absurd if they make contracts 
<A NAME="508"></A>and return deposits, and so on? Acts of a brave man, then, confronting 
<A NAME="509"></A>dangers and running risks because it is noble to do so? Or liberal acts? 
<A NAME="510"></A>To whom will they give? It will be strange if they are really to have money 
<A NAME="511"></A>or anything of the kind. And what would their temperate acts be? Is not 
<A NAME="512"></A>such praise tasteless, since they have no bad appetites? If we were to 
<A NAME="513"></A>run through them all, the circumstances of action would be found trivial 
<A NAME="514"></A>and unworthy of gods. Still, every one supposes that they live and therefore 
<A NAME="515"></A>that they are active; we cannot suppose them to sleep like Endymion. Now 
<A NAME="516"></A>if you take away from a living being action, and still more production, 
<A NAME="517"></A>what is left but contemplation? Therefore the activity of God, which surpasses 
<A NAME="518"></A>all others in blessedness, must be contemplative; and of human activities, 
<A NAME="519"></A>therefore, that which is most akin to this must be most of the nature of 
<A NAME="520"></A>happiness.
<A NAME="521"></A><BR><BR>This is indicated, too, by the fact that the other animals have 
<A NAME="522"></A>no share in happiness, being completely deprived of such activity. For 
<A NAME="523"></A>while the whole life of the gods is blessed, and that of men too in so 
<A NAME="524"></A>far as some likeness of such activity belongs to them, none of the other 
<A NAME="525"></A>animals is happy, since they in no way share in contemplation. Happiness 
<A NAME="526"></A>extends, then, just so far as contemplation does, and those to whom contemplation 
<A NAME="527"></A>more fully belongs are more truly happy, not as a mere concomitant but 
<A NAME="528"></A>in virtue of the contemplation; for this is in itself precious. Happiness, 
<A NAME="529"></A>therefore, must be some form of contemplation.
<A NAME="530"></A><BR><BR>But, being a man, one will also need external prosperity; for our 
<A NAME="531"></A>nature is not self-sufficient for the purpose of contemplation, but our 
<A NAME="532"></A>body also must be healthy and must have food and other attention. Still, 
<A NAME="533"></A>we must not think that the man who is to be happy will need many things 
<A NAME="534"></A>or great things, merely because he cannot be supremely happy without external 
<A NAME="535"></A>goods; for self-sufficiency and action do not involve excess, and we can 
<A NAME="536"></A>do noble acts without ruling earth and sea; for even with moderate advantages 
<A NAME="537"></A>one can act virtuously (this is manifest enough; for private persons are 
<A NAME="538"></A>thought to do worthy acts no less than despots-indeed even more); and it 
<A NAME="539"></A>is enough that we should have so much as that; for the life of the man 
<A NAME="540"></A>who is active in accordance with virtue will be happy. Solon, too, was 
<A NAME="541"></A>perhaps sketching well the happy man when he described him as moderately 
<A NAME="542"></A>furnished with externals but as having done (as Solon thought) the noblest 
<A NAME="543"></A>acts, and lived temperately; for one can with but moderate possessions 
<A NAME="544"></A>do what one ought. Anaxagoras also seems to have supposed the happy man 
<A NAME="545"></A>not to be rich nor a despot, when he said that he would not be surprised 
<A NAME="546"></A>if the happy man were to seem to most people a strange person; for they 
<A NAME="547"></A>judge by externals, since these are all they perceive. The opinions of 
<A NAME="548"></A>the wise seem, then, to harmonize with our arguments. But while even such 
<A NAME="549"></A>things carry some conviction, the truth in practical matters is discerned 
<A NAME="550"></A>from the facts of life; for these are the decisive factor. We must therefore 
<A NAME="551"></A>survey what we have already said, bringing it to the test of the facts 
<A NAME="552"></A>of life, and if it harmonizes with the facts we must accept it, but if 
<A NAME="553"></A>it clashes with them we must suppose it to be mere theory. Now he who exercises 
<A NAME="554"></A>his reason and cultivates it seems to be both in the best state of mind 
<A NAME="555"></A>and most dear to the gods. For if the gods have any care for human affairs, 
<A NAME="556"></A>as they are thought to have, it would be reasonable both that they should 
<A NAME="557"></A>delight in that which was best and most akin to them (i.e. reason) and 
<A NAME="558"></A>that they should reward those who love and honour this most, as caring 
<A NAME="559"></A>for the things that are dear to them and acting both rightly and nobly. 
<A NAME="560"></A>And that all these attributes belong most of all to the philosopher is 
<A NAME="561"></A>manifest. He, therefore, is the dearest to the gods. And he who is that 
<A NAME="562"></A>will presumably be also the happiest; so that in this way too the philosopher 
<A NAME="563"></A>will more than any other be happy.
<A NAME="564"></A><BR><BR>9
<A NAME="565"></A><BR><BR>If these matters and the virtues, and also friendship and pleasure, 
<A NAME="566"></A>have been dealt with sufficiently in outline, are we to suppose that our 
<A NAME="567"></A>programme has reached its end? Surely, as the saying goes, where there 
<A NAME="568"></A>are things to be done the end is not to survey and recognize the various 
<A NAME="569"></A>things, but rather to do them; with regard to virtue, then, it is not enough 
<A NAME="570"></A>to know, but we must try to have and use it, or try any other way there 
<A NAME="571"></A>may be of becoming good. Now if arguments were in themselves enough to 
<A NAME="572"></A>make men good, they would justly, as Theognis says, have won very great 
<A NAME="573"></A>rewards, and such rewards should have been provided; but as things are, 
<A NAME="574"></A>while they seem to have power to encourage and stimulate the generous-minded 
<A NAME="575"></A>among our youth, and to make a character which is gently born, and a true 
<A NAME="576"></A>lover of what is noble, ready to be possessed by virtue, they are not able 
<A NAME="577"></A>to encourage the many to nobility and goodness. For these do not by nature 
<A NAME="578"></A>obey the sense of shame, but only fear, and do not abstain from bad acts 
<A NAME="579"></A>because of their baseness but through fear of punishment; living by passion 
<A NAME="580"></A>they pursue their own pleasures and the means to them, and and the opposite 
<A NAME="581"></A>pains, and have not even a conception of what is noble and truly pleasant, 
<A NAME="582"></A>since they have never tasted it. What argument would remould such people? 
<A NAME="583"></A>It is hard, if not impossible, to remove by argument the traits that have 
<A NAME="584"></A>long since been incorporated in the character; and perhaps we must be content 
<A NAME="585"></A>if, when all the influences by which we are thought to become good are 
<A NAME="586"></A>present, we get some tincture of virtue.
<A NAME="587"></A><BR><BR>Now some think that we are made good by nature, others by habituation, 
<A NAME="588"></A>others by teaching. Nature's part evidently does not depend on us, but 
<A NAME="589"></A>as a result of some divine causes is present in those who are truly fortunate; 
<A NAME="590"></A>while argument and teaching, we may suspect, are not powerful with all 
<A NAME="591"></A>men, but the soul of the student must first have been cultivated by means 
<A NAME="592"></A>of habits for noble joy and noble hatred, like earth which is to nourish 
<A NAME="593"></A>the seed. For he who lives as passion directs will not hear argument that 
<A NAME="594"></A>dissuades him, nor understand it if he does; and how can we persuade one 
<A NAME="595"></A>in such a state to change his ways? And in general passion seems to yield 
<A NAME="596"></A>not to argument but to force. The character, then, must somehow be there 
<A NAME="597"></A>already with a kinship to virtue, loving what is noble and hating what 
<A NAME="598"></A>is base.
<A NAME="599"></A><BR><BR>But it is difficult to get from youth up a right training for virtue 
<A NAME="600"></A>if one has not been brought up under right laws; for to live temperately 
<A NAME="601"></A>and hardily is not pleasant to most people, especially when they are young. 
<A NAME="602"></A>For this reason their nurture and occupations should be fixed by law; for 
<A NAME="603"></A>they will not be painful when they have become customary. But it is surely 
<A NAME="604"></A>not enough that when they are young they should get the right nurture and 
<A NAME="605"></A>attention; since they must, even when they are grown up, practise and be 
<A NAME="606"></A>habituated to them, we shall need laws for this as well, and generally 
<A NAME="607"></A>speaking to cover the whole of life; for most people obey necessity rather 
<A NAME="608"></A>than argument, and punishments rather than the sense of what is 
<A NAME="609"></A>noble.
<A NAME="610"></A><BR><BR>This is why some think that legislators ought to stimulate men 
<A NAME="611"></A>to virtue and urge them forward by the motive of the noble, on the assumption 
<A NAME="612"></A>that those who have been well advanced by the formation of habits will 
<A NAME="613"></A>attend to such influences; and that punishments and penalties should be 
<A NAME="614"></A>imposed on those who disobey and are of inferior nature, while the incurably 
<A NAME="615"></A>bad should be completely banished. A good man (they think), since he lives 
<A NAME="616"></A>with his mind fixed on what is noble, will submit to argument, while a 
<A NAME="617"></A>bad man, whose desire is for pleasure, is corrected by pain like a beast 
<A NAME="618"></A>of burden. This is, too, why they say the pains inflicted should be those 
<A NAME="619"></A>that are most opposed to the pleasures such men love.
<A NAME="620"></A><BR><BR>However that may be, if (as we have said) the man who is to be 
<A NAME="621"></A>good must be well trained and habituated, and go on to spend his time in 
<A NAME="622"></A>worthy occupations and neither willingly nor unwillingly do bad actions, 
<A NAME="623"></A>and if this can be brought about if men live in accordance with a sort 
<A NAME="624"></A>of reason and right order, provided this has force,-if this be so, the 
<A NAME="625"></A>paternal command indeed has not the required force or compulsive power 
<A NAME="626"></A>(nor in general has the command of one man, unless he be a king or something 
<A NAME="627"></A>similar), but the law has compulsive power, while it is at the same time 
<A NAME="628"></A>a rule proceeding from a sort of practical wisdom and reason. And while 
<A NAME="629"></A>people hate men who oppose their impulses, even if they oppose them rightly, 
<A NAME="630"></A>the law in its ordaining of what is good is not burdensome.
<A NAME="631"></A><BR><BR>In the Spartan state alone, or almost alone, the legislator seems 
<A NAME="632"></A>to have paid attention to questions of nurture and occupations; in most 
<A NAME="633"></A>states such matters have been neglected, and each man lives as he pleases, 
<A NAME="634"></A>Cyclops-fashion, 'to his own wife and children dealing law'. Now it is 
<A NAME="635"></A>best that there should be a public and proper care for such matters; but 
<A NAME="636"></A>if they are neglected by the community it would seem right for each man 
<A NAME="637"></A>to help his children and friends towards virtue, and that they should have 
<A NAME="638"></A>the power, or at least the will, to do this.
<A NAME="639"></A><BR><BR>It would seem from what has been said that he can do this better 
<A NAME="640"></A>if he makes himself capable of legislating. For public control is plainly 
<A NAME="641"></A>effected by laws, and good control by good laws; whether written or unwritten 
<A NAME="642"></A>would seem to make no difference, nor whether they are laws providing for 
<A NAME="643"></A>the education of individuals or of groups-any more than it does in the 
<A NAME="644"></A>case of music or gymnastics and other such pursuits. For as in cities laws 
<A NAME="645"></A>and prevailing types of character have force, so in households do the injunctions 
<A NAME="646"></A>and the habits of the father, and these have even more because of the tie 
<A NAME="647"></A>of blood and the benefits he confers; for the children start with a natural 
<A NAME="648"></A>affection and disposition to obey. Further, private education has an advantage 
<A NAME="649"></A>over public, as private medical treatment has; for while in general rest 
<A NAME="650"></A>and abstinence from food are good for a man in a fever, for a particular 
<A NAME="651"></A>man they may not be; and a boxer presumably does not prescribe the same 
<A NAME="652"></A>style of fighting to all his pupils. It would seem, then, that the detail 
<A NAME="653"></A>is worked out with more precision if the control is private; for each person 
<A NAME="654"></A>is more likely to get what suits his case.
<A NAME="655"></A><BR><BR>But the details can be best looked after, one by one, by a doctor 
<A NAME="656"></A>or gymnastic instructor or any one else who has the general knowledge of 
<A NAME="657"></A>what is good for every one or for people of a certain kind (for the sciences 
<A NAME="658"></A>both are said to be, and are, concerned with what is universal); not but 
<A NAME="659"></A>what some particular detail may perhaps be well looked after by an unscientific 
<A NAME="660"></A>person, if he has studied accurately in the light of experience what happens 
<A NAME="661"></A>in each case, just as some people seem to be their own best doctors, though 
<A NAME="662"></A>they could give no help to any one else. None the less, it will perhaps 
<A NAME="663"></A>be agreed that if a man does wish to become master of an art or science 
<A NAME="664"></A>he must go to the universal, and come to know it as well as possible; for, 
<A NAME="665"></A>as we have said, it is with this that the sciences are 
<A NAME="666"></A>concerned.
<A NAME="667"></A><BR><BR>And surely he who wants to make men, whether many or few, better 
<A NAME="668"></A>by his care must try to become capable of legislating, if it is through 
<A NAME="669"></A>laws that we can become good. For to get any one whatever-any one who is 
<A NAME="670"></A>put before us-into the right condition is not for the first chance comer; 
<A NAME="671"></A>if any one can do it, it is the man who knows, just as in medicine and 
<A NAME="672"></A>all other matters which give scope for care and prudence.
<A NAME="673"></A><BR><BR>Must we not, then, next examine whence or how one can learn how 
<A NAME="674"></A>to legislate? Is it, as in all other cases, from statesmen? Certainly it 
<A NAME="675"></A>was thought to be a part of statesmanship. Or is a difference apparent 
<A NAME="676"></A>between statesmanship and the other sciences and arts? In the others the 
<A NAME="677"></A>same people are found offering to teach the arts and practising them, e.g. 
<A NAME="678"></A>doctors or painters; but while the sophists profess to teach politics, 
<A NAME="679"></A>it is practised not by any of them but by the politicians, who would seem 
<A NAME="680"></A>to do so by dint of a certain skill and experience rather than of thought; 
<A NAME="681"></A>for they are not found either writing or speaking about such matters (though 
<A NAME="682"></A>it were a nobler occupation perhaps than composing speeches for the law-courts 
<A NAME="683"></A>and the assembly), nor again are they found to have made statesmen of their 
<A NAME="684"></A>own sons or any other of their friends. But it was to be expected that 
<A NAME="685"></A>they should if they could; for there is nothing better than such a skill 
<A NAME="686"></A>that they could have left to their cities, or could prefer to have for 
<A NAME="687"></A>themselves, or, therefore, for those dearest to them. Still, experience 
<A NAME="688"></A>seems to contribute not a little; else they could not have become politicians 
<A NAME="689"></A>by familiarity with politics; and so it seems that those who aim at knowing 
<A NAME="690"></A>about the art of politics need experience as well.
<A NAME="691"></A><BR><BR>But those of the sophists who profess the art seem to be very far 
<A NAME="692"></A>from teaching it. For, to put the matter generally, they do not even know 
<A NAME="693"></A>what kind of thing it is nor what kinds of things it is about; otherwise 
<A NAME="694"></A>they would not have classed it as identical with rhetoric or even inferior 
<A NAME="695"></A>to it, nor have thought it easy to legislate by collecting the laws that 
<A NAME="696"></A>are thought well of; they say it is possible to select the best laws, as 
<A NAME="697"></A>though even the selection did not demand intelligence and as though right 
<A NAME="698"></A>judgement were not the greatest thing, as in matters of music. For while 
<A NAME="699"></A>people experienced in any department judge rightly the works produced in 
<A NAME="700"></A>it, and understand by what means or how they are achieved, and what harmonizes 
<A NAME="701"></A>with what, the inexperienced must be content if they do not fail to see 
<A NAME="702"></A>whether the work has been well or ill made-as in the case of painting. 
<A NAME="703"></A>Now laws are as it were the' works' of the political art; how then can 
<A NAME="704"></A>one learn from them to be a legislator, or judge which are best? Even medical 
<A NAME="705"></A>men do not seem to be made by a study of text-books. Yet people try, at 
<A NAME="706"></A>any rate, to state not only the treatments, but also how particular classes 
<A NAME="707"></A>of people can be cured and should be treated-distinguishing the various 
<A NAME="708"></A>habits of body; but while this seems useful to experienced people, to the 
<A NAME="709"></A>inexperienced it is valueless. Surely, then, while collections of laws, 
<A NAME="710"></A>and of constitutions also, may be serviceable to those who can study them 
<A NAME="711"></A>and judge what is good or bad and what enactments suit what circumstances, 
<A NAME="712"></A>those who go through such collections without a practised faculty will 
<A NAME="713"></A>not have right judgement (unless it be as a spontaneous gift of nature), 
<A NAME="714"></A>though they may perhaps become more intelligent in such 
<A NAME="715"></A>matters.
<A NAME="716"></A><BR><BR>Now our predecessors have left the subject of legislation to us 
<A NAME="717"></A>unexamined; it is perhaps best, therefore, that we should ourselves study 
<A NAME="718"></A>it, and in general study the question of the constitution, in order to 
<A NAME="719"></A>complete to the best of our ability our philosophy of human nature. First, 
<A NAME="720"></A>then, if anything has been said well in detail by earlier thinkers, let 
<A NAME="721"></A>us try to review it; then in the light of the constitutions we have collected 
<A NAME="722"></A>let us study what sorts of influence preserve and destroy states, and what 
<A NAME="723"></A>sorts preserve or destroy the particular kinds of constitution, and to 
<A NAME="724"></A>what causes it is due that some are well and others ill administered. When 
<A NAME="725"></A>these have been studied we shall perhaps be more likely to see with a comprehensive 
<A NAME="726"></A>view, which constitution is best, and how each must be ordered, and what 
<A NAME="727"></A>laws and customs it must use, if it is to be at its best. Let us make a 
<A NAME="728"></A>beginning of our discussion.
