<A NAME="10"></A><B>Part 1</B>
<A NAME="11"></A><BR><BR>"<BR><BR>
<A NAME="12"></A><BR><BR>"THAT Wisdom is a science of first principles is evident from the 
<A NAME="13"></A>introductory chapters, in which we have raised objections to the statements 
<A NAME="14"></A>of others about the first principles; but one might ask the question whether 
<A NAME="15"></A>Wisdom is to be conceived as one science or as several. If as one, it may 
<A NAME="16"></A>be objected that one science always deals with contraries, but the first 
<A NAME="17"></A>principles are not contrary. If it is not one, what sort of sciences are 
<A NAME="18"></A>those with which it is to be identified? <BR><BR>"Further, is it the business 
<A NAME="19"></A>of one science, or of more than one, to examine the first principles of 
<A NAME="20"></A>demonstration? If of one, why of this rather than of any other? If of more, 
<A NAME="21"></A>what sort of sciences must these be said to be? <BR><BR>"Further, does 
<A NAME="22"></A>Wisdom investigate all substances or not? If not all, it is hard to say 
<A NAME="23"></A>which; but if, being one, it investigates them all, it is doubtful how 
<A NAME="24"></A>the same science can embrace several subject-matters. <BR><BR>"Further, 
<A NAME="25"></A>does it deal with substances only or also with their attributes? If in 
<A NAME="26"></A>the case of attributes demonstration is possible, in that of substances 
<A NAME="27"></A>it is not. But if the two sciences are different, what is each of them 
<A NAME="28"></A>and which is Wisdom? If we think of it as demonstrative, the science of 
<A NAME="29"></A>the attributes is Wisdom, but if as dealing with what is primary, the science 
<A NAME="30"></A>of substances claims the tide. <BR><BR>"But again the science we are looking 
<A NAME="31"></A>for must not be supposed to deal with the causes which have been mentioned 
<A NAME="32"></A>in the Physics. For (A) it does not deal with the final cause (for that 
<A NAME="33"></A>is the nature of the good, and this is found in the field of action and 
<A NAME="34"></A>movement; and it is the first mover-for that is the nature of the end-but 
<A NAME="35"></A>in the case of things unmovable there is nothing that moved them first), 
<A NAME="36"></A>and (B) in general it is hard to say whether perchance the science we are 
<A NAME="37"></A>now looking for deals with perceptible substances or not with them, but 
<A NAME="38"></A>with certain others. If with others, it must deal either with the Forms 
<A NAME="39"></A>or with the objects of mathematics. Now (a) evidently the Forms do not 
<A NAME="40"></A>exist. (But it is hard to say, even if one suppose them to exist, why in 
<A NAME="41"></A>the world the same is not true of the other things of which there are Forms, 
<A NAME="42"></A>as of the objects of mathematics. I mean that these thinkers place the 
<A NAME="43"></A>objects of mathematics between the Forms and perceptible things, as a kind 
<A NAME="44"></A>of third set of things apart both from the Forms and from the things in 
<A NAME="45"></A>this world; but there is not a third man or horse besides the ideal and 
<A NAME="46"></A>the individuals. If on the other hand it is not as they say, with what 
<A NAME="47"></A>sort of things must the mathematician be supposed to deal? Certainly not 
<A NAME="48"></A>with the things in this world; for none of these is the sort of thing which 
<A NAME="49"></A>the mathematical sciences demand.) Nor (b) does the science which we are 
<A NAME="50"></A>now seeking treat of the objects of mathematics; for none of them can exist 
<A NAME="51"></A>separately. But again it does not deal with perceptible substances; for 
<A NAME="52"></A>they are perishable. <BR><BR>"In general one might raise the question, 
<A NAME="53"></A>to what kind of science it belongs to discuss the difficulties about the 
<A NAME="54"></A>matter of the objects of mathematics. Neither to physics (because the whole 
<A NAME="55"></A>inquiry of the physicist is about the things that have in themselves a 
<A NAME="56"></A>principle. of movement and rest), nor yet to the science which inquires 
<A NAME="57"></A>into demonstration and science; for this is just the subject which it investigates. 
<A NAME="58"></A>It remains then that it is the philosophy which we have set before ourselves 
<A NAME="59"></A>that treats of those subjects. <BR><BR>"One might discuss the question 
<A NAME="60"></A>whether the science we are seeking should be said to deal with the principles 
<A NAME="61"></A>which are by some called elements; all men suppose these to be present 
<A NAME="62"></A>in composite things. But it might be thought that the science we seek should 
<A NAME="63"></A>treat rather of universals; for every definition and every science is of 
<A NAME="64"></A>universals and not of infimae species, so that as far as this goes it would 
<A NAME="65"></A>deal with the highest genera. These would turn out to be being and unity; 
<A NAME="66"></A>for these might most of all be supposed to contain all things that are, 
<A NAME="67"></A>and to be most like principles because they are by nature; for if they 
<A NAME="68"></A>perish all other things are destroyed with them; for everything is and 
<A NAME="69"></A>is one. But inasmuch as, if one is to suppose them to be genera, they must 
<A NAME="70"></A>be predicable of their differentiae, and no genus is predicable of any 
<A NAME="71"></A>of its differentiae, in this way it would seem that we should not make 
<A NAME="72"></A>them genera nor principles. Further, if the simpler is more of a principle 
<A NAME="73"></A>than the less simple, and the ultimate members of the genus are simpler 
<A NAME="74"></A>than the genera (for they are indivisible, but the genera are divided into 
<A NAME="75"></A>many and differing species), the species might seem to be the principles, 
<A NAME="76"></A>rather than the genera. But inasmuch as the species are involved in the 
<A NAME="77"></A>destruction of the genera, the genera are more like principles; for that 
<A NAME="78"></A>which involves another in its destruction is a principle of it. These and 
<A NAME="79"></A>others of the kind are the subjects that involve difficulties.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="80"></A><B>Part 2</B>
<A NAME="81"></A>"<BR><BR>
<A NAME="82"></A><BR><BR>"Further, must we suppose something apart from individual things, 
<A NAME="83"></A>or is it these that the science we are seeking treats of? But these are 
<A NAME="84"></A>infinite in number. Yet the things that are apart from the individuals 
<A NAME="85"></A>are genera or species; but the science we now seek treats of neither of 
<A NAME="86"></A>these. The reason why this is impossible has been stated. Indeed, it is 
<A NAME="87"></A>in general hard to say whether one must assume that there is a separable 
<A NAME="88"></A>substance besides the sensible substances (i.e. the substances in this 
<A NAME="89"></A>world), or that these are the real things and Wisdom is concerned with 
<A NAME="90"></A>them. For we seem to seek another kind of substance, and this is our problem, 
<A NAME="91"></A>i.e. to see if there is something which can exist apart by itself and belongs 
<A NAME="92"></A>to no sensible thing.-Further, if there is another substance apart from 
<A NAME="93"></A>and corresponding to sensible substances, which kinds of sensible substance 
<A NAME="94"></A>must be supposed to have this corresponding to them? Why should one suppose 
<A NAME="95"></A>men or horses to have it, more than either the other animals or even all 
<A NAME="96"></A>lifeless things? On the other hand to set up other and eternal substances 
<A NAME="97"></A>equal in number to the sensible and perishable substances would seem to 
<A NAME="98"></A>fall beyond the bounds of probability.-But if the principle we now seek 
<A NAME="99"></A>is not separable from corporeal things, what has a better claim to the 
<A NAME="100"></A>name matter? This, however, does not exist in actuality, but exists in 
<A NAME="101"></A>potency. And it would seem rather that the form or shape is a more important 
<A NAME="102"></A>principle than this; but the form is perishable, so that there is no eternal 
<A NAME="103"></A>substance at all which can exist apart and independent. But this is paradoxical; 
<A NAME="104"></A>for such a principle and substance seems to exist and is sought by nearly 
<A NAME="105"></A>all the most refined thinkers as something that exists; for how is there 
<A NAME="106"></A>to be order unless there is something eternal and independent and permanent? 
<A NAME="107"></A><BR><BR>"Further, if there is a substance or principle of such a nature 
<A NAME="108"></A>as that which we are now seeking, and if this is one for all things, and 
<A NAME="109"></A>the same for eternal and for perishable things, it is hard to say why in 
<A NAME="110"></A>the world, if there is the same principle, some of the things that fall 
<A NAME="111"></A>under the principle are eternal, and others are not eternal; this is paradoxical. 
<A NAME="112"></A>But if there is one principle of perishable and another of eternal things, 
<A NAME="113"></A>we shall be in a like difficulty if the principle of perishable things, 
<A NAME="114"></A>as well as that of eternal, is eternal; for why, if the principle is eternal, 
<A NAME="115"></A>are not the things that fall under the principle also eternal? But if it 
<A NAME="116"></A>is perishable another principle is involved to account for it, and another 
<A NAME="117"></A>to account for that, and this will go on to infinity. <BR><BR>"If on the 
<A NAME="118"></A>other hand we are to set up what are thought to be the most unchangeable 
<A NAME="119"></A>principles, being and unity, firstly, if each of these does not indicate 
<A NAME="120"></A>a 'this' or substance, how will they be separable and independent? Yet 
<A NAME="121"></A>we expect the eternal and primary principles to be so. But if each of them 
<A NAME="122"></A>does signify a 'this' or substance, all things that are are substances; 
<A NAME="123"></A>for being is predicated of all things (and unity also of some); but that 
<A NAME="124"></A>all things that are are substance is false. Further, how can they be right 
<A NAME="125"></A>who say that the first principle is unity and this is substance, and generate 
<A NAME="126"></A>number as the first product from unity and from matter, assert that number 
<A NAME="127"></A>is substance? How are we to think of 'two', and each of the other numbers 
<A NAME="128"></A>composed of units, as one? On this point neither do they say anything nor 
<A NAME="129"></A>is it easy to say anything. But if we are to suppose lines or what comes 
<A NAME="130"></A>after these (I mean the primary surfaces) to be principles, these at least 
<A NAME="131"></A>are not separable substances, but sections and divisions-the former of 
<A NAME="132"></A>surfaces, the latter of bodies (while points are sections and divisions 
<A NAME="133"></A>of lines); and further they are limits of these same things; and all these 
<A NAME="134"></A>are in other things and none is separable. Further, how are we to suppose 
<A NAME="135"></A>that there is a substance of unity and the point? Every substance comes 
<A NAME="136"></A>into being by a gradual process, but a point does not; for the point is 
<A NAME="137"></A>a division. <BR><BR>"A further difficulty is raised by the fact that all 
<A NAME="138"></A>knowledge is of universals and of the 'such', but substance is not a universal, 
<A NAME="139"></A>but is rather a 'this'-a separable thing, so that if there is knowledge 
<A NAME="140"></A>about the first principles, the question arises, how are we to suppose 
<A NAME="141"></A>the first principle to be substance? <BR><BR>"Further, is there anything 
<A NAME="142"></A>apart from the concrete thing (by which I mean the matter and that which 
<A NAME="143"></A>is joined with it), or not? If not, we are met by the objection that all 
<A NAME="144"></A>things that are in matter are perishable. But if there is something, it 
<A NAME="145"></A>must be the form or shape. Now it is hard to determine in which cases this 
<A NAME="146"></A>exists apart and in which it does not; for in some cases the form is evidently 
<A NAME="147"></A>not separable, e.g. in the case of a house. <BR><BR>"Further, are the principles 
<A NAME="148"></A>the same in kind or in number? If they are one in number, all things will 
<A NAME="149"></A>be the same.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="150"></A><B>Part 3</B>
<A NAME="151"></A>"<BR><BR>
<A NAME="152"></A><BR><BR>"Since the science of the philosopher treats of being qua being 
<A NAME="153"></A>universally and not in respect of a part of it, and 'being' has many senses 
<A NAME="154"></A>and is not used in one only, it follows that if the word is used equivocally 
<A NAME="155"></A>and in virtue of nothing common to its various uses, being does not fall 
<A NAME="156"></A>under one science (for the meanings of an equivocal term do not form one 
<A NAME="157"></A>genus); but if the word is used in virtue of something common, being will 
<A NAME="158"></A>fall under one science. The term seems to be used in the way we have mentioned, 
<A NAME="159"></A>like 'medical' and 'healthy'. For each of these also we use in many senses. 
<A NAME="160"></A>Terms are used in this way by virtue of some kind of reference, in the 
<A NAME="161"></A>one case to medical science, in the other to health, in others to something 
<A NAME="162"></A>else, but in each case to one identical concept. For a discussion and a 
<A NAME="163"></A>knife are called medical because the former proceeds from medical science, 
<A NAME="164"></A>and the latter is useful to it. And a thing is called healthy in a similar 
<A NAME="165"></A>way; one thing because it is indicative of health, another because it is 
<A NAME="166"></A>productive of it. And the same is true in the other cases. Everything that 
<A NAME="167"></A>is, then, is said to 'be' in this same way; each thing that is is said 
<A NAME="168"></A>to 'be' because it is a modification of being qua being or a permanent 
<A NAME="169"></A>or a transient state or a movement of it, or something else of the sort. 
<A NAME="170"></A>And since everything that is may be referred to something single and common, 
<A NAME="171"></A>each of the contrarieties also may be referred to the first differences 
<A NAME="172"></A>and contrarieties of being, whether the first differences of being are 
<A NAME="173"></A>plurality and unity, or likeness and unlikeness, or some other differences; 
<A NAME="174"></A>let these be taken as already discussed. It makes no difference whether 
<A NAME="175"></A>that which is be referred to being or to unity. For even if they are not 
<A NAME="176"></A>the same but different, at least they are convertible; for that which is 
<A NAME="177"></A>one is also somehow being, and that which is being is one. <BR><BR>"But 
<A NAME="178"></A>since every pair of contraries falls to be examined by one and the same 
<A NAME="179"></A>science, and in each pair one term is the privative of the other though 
<A NAME="180"></A>one might regarding some contraries raise the question, how they can be 
<A NAME="181"></A>privately related, viz. those which have an intermediate, e.g. unjust and 
<A NAME="182"></A>just-in all such cases one must maintain that the privation is not of the 
<A NAME="183"></A>whole definition, but of the infima species. if the just man is 'by virtue 
<A NAME="184"></A>of some permanent disposition obedient to the laws', the unjust man will 
<A NAME="185"></A>not in every case have the whole definition denied of him, but may be merely 
<A NAME="186"></A>'in some respect deficient in obedience to the laws', and in this respect 
<A NAME="187"></A>the privation will attach to him; and similarly in all other cases. <BR><BR>"As 
<A NAME="188"></A>the mathematician investigates abstractions (for before beginning his investigation 
<A NAME="189"></A>he strips off all the sensible qualities, e.g. weight and lightness, hardness 
<A NAME="190"></A>and its contrary, and also heat and cold and the other sensible contrarieties, 
<A NAME="191"></A>and leaves only the quantitative and continuous, sometimes in one, sometimes 
<A NAME="192"></A>in two, sometimes in three dimensions, and the attributes of these qua 
<A NAME="193"></A>quantitative and continuous, and does not consider them in any other respect, 
<A NAME="194"></A>and examines the relative positions of some and the attributes of these, 
<A NAME="195"></A>and the commensurabilities and incommensurabilities of others, and the 
<A NAME="196"></A>ratios of others; but yet we posit one and the same science of all these 
<A NAME="197"></A>things--geometry)--the same is true with regard to being. For the attributes 
<A NAME="198"></A>of this in so far as it is being, and the contrarieties in it qua being, 
<A NAME="199"></A>it is the business of no other science than philosophy to investigate; 
<A NAME="200"></A>for to physics one would assign the study of things not qua being, but 
<A NAME="201"></A>rather qua sharing in movement; while dialectic and sophistic deal with 
<A NAME="202"></A>the attributes of things that are, but not of things qua being, and not 
<A NAME="203"></A>with being itself in so far as it is being; therefore it remains that it 
<A NAME="204"></A>is the philosopher who studies the things we have named, in so far as they 
<A NAME="205"></A>are being. Since all that is is to 'be' in virtue of something single and 
<A NAME="206"></A>common, though the term has many meanings, and contraries are in the same 
<A NAME="207"></A>case (for they are referred to the first contrarieties and differences 
<A NAME="208"></A>of being), and things of this sort can fall under one science, the difficulty 
<A NAME="209"></A>we stated at the beginning appears to be solved,-I mean the question how 
<A NAME="210"></A>there can be a single science of things which are many and different in 
<A NAME="211"></A>genus.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="212"></A><B>Part 4</B>
<A NAME="213"></A>"<BR><BR>
<A NAME="214"></A><BR><BR>"Since even the mathematician uses the common axioms only in a 
<A NAME="215"></A>special application, it must be the business of first philosophy to examine 
<A NAME="216"></A>the principles of mathematics also. That when equals are taken from equals 
<A NAME="217"></A>the remainders are equal, is common to all quantities, but mathematics 
<A NAME="218"></A>studies a part of its proper matter which it has detached, e.g. lines or 
<A NAME="219"></A>angles or numbers or some other kind of quantity-not, however, qua being 
<A NAME="220"></A>but in so far as each of them is continuous in one or two or three dimensions; 
<A NAME="221"></A>but philosophy does not inquire about particular subjects in so far as 
<A NAME="222"></A>each of them has some attribute or other, but speculates about being, in 
<A NAME="223"></A>so far as each particular thing is.-Physics is in the same position as 
<A NAME="224"></A>mathematics; for physics studies the attributes and the principles of the 
<A NAME="225"></A>things that are, qua moving and not qua being (whereas the primary science, 
<A NAME="226"></A>we have said, deals with these, only in so far as the underlying subjects 
<A NAME="227"></A>are existent, and not in virtue of any other character); and so both physics 
<A NAME="228"></A>and mathematics must be classed as parts of Wisdom.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="229"></A><B>Part 5</B>
<A NAME="230"></A>"<BR><BR>
<A NAME="231"></A><BR><BR>"There is a principle in things, about which we cannot be deceived, 
<A NAME="232"></A>but must always, on the contrary recognize the truth,-viz. that the same 
<A NAME="233"></A>thing cannot at one and the same time be and not be, or admit any other 
<A NAME="234"></A>similar pair of opposites. About such matters there is no proof in the 
<A NAME="235"></A>full sense, though there is proof ad hominem. For it is not possible to 
<A NAME="236"></A>infer this truth itself from a more certain principle, yet this is necessary 
<A NAME="237"></A>if there is to be completed proof of it in the full sense. But he who wants 
<A NAME="238"></A>to prove to the asserter of opposites that he is wrong must get from him 
<A NAME="239"></A>an admission which shall be identical with the principle that the same 
<A NAME="240"></A>thing cannot be and not be at one and the same time, but shall not seem 
<A NAME="241"></A>to be identical; for thus alone can his thesis be demonstrated to the man 
<A NAME="242"></A>who asserts that opposite statements can be truly made about the same subject. 
<A NAME="243"></A>Those, then, who are to join in argument with one another must to some 
<A NAME="244"></A>extent understand one another; for if this does not happen how are they 
<A NAME="245"></A>to join in argument with one another? Therefore every word must be intelligible 
<A NAME="246"></A>and indicate something, and not many things but only one; and if it signifies 
<A NAME="247"></A>more than one thing, it must be made plain to which of these the word is 
<A NAME="248"></A>being applied. He, then, who says 'this is and is not' denies what he affirms, 
<A NAME="249"></A>so that what the word signifies, he says it does not signify; and this 
<A NAME="250"></A>is impossible. Therefore if 'this is' signifies something, one cannot truly 
<A NAME="251"></A>assert its contradictory. <BR><BR>"Further, if the word signifies something 
<A NAME="252"></A>and this is asserted truly, this connexion must be necessary; and it is 
<A NAME="253"></A>not possible that that which necessarily is should ever not be; it is not 
<A NAME="254"></A>possible therefore to make the opposed affirmations and negations truly 
<A NAME="255"></A>of the same subject. Further, if the affirmation is no more true than the 
<A NAME="256"></A>negation, he who says 'man' will be no more right than he who says 'not-man'. 
<A NAME="257"></A>It would seem also that in saying the man is not a horse one would be either 
<A NAME="258"></A>more or not less right than in saying he is not a man, so that one will 
<A NAME="259"></A>also be right in saying that the same person is a horse; for it was assumed 
<A NAME="260"></A>to be possible to make opposite statements equally truly. It follows then 
<A NAME="261"></A>that the same person is a man and a horse, or any other animal. <BR><BR>"While, 
<A NAME="262"></A>then, there is no proof of these things in the full sense, there is a proof 
<A NAME="263"></A>which may suffice against one who will make these suppositions. And perhaps 
<A NAME="264"></A>if one had questioned Heraclitus himself in this way one might have forced 
<A NAME="265"></A>him to confess that opposite statements can never be true of the same subjects. 
<A NAME="266"></A>But, as it is, he adopted this opinion without understanding what his statement 
<A NAME="267"></A>involves. But in any case if what is said by him is true, not even this 
<A NAME="268"></A>itself will be true-viz. that the same thing can at one and the same time 
<A NAME="269"></A>both be and not be. For as, when the statements are separated, the affirmation 
<A NAME="270"></A>is no more true than the negation, in the same way-the combined and complex 
<A NAME="271"></A>statement being like a single affirmation-the whole taken as an affirmation 
<A NAME="272"></A>will be no more true than the negation. Further, if it is not possible 
<A NAME="273"></A>to affirm anything truly, this itself will be false-the assertion that 
<A NAME="274"></A>there is no true affirmation. But if a true affirmation exists, this appears 
<A NAME="275"></A>to refute what is said by those who raise such objections and utterly destroy 
<A NAME="276"></A>rational discourse.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="277"></A><B>Part 6</B>
<A NAME="278"></A>"<BR><BR>
<A NAME="279"></A><BR><BR>"The saying of Protagoras is like the views we have mentioned; 
<A NAME="280"></A>he said that man is the measure of all things, meaning simply that that 
<A NAME="281"></A>which seems to each man also assuredly is. If this is so, it follows that 
<A NAME="282"></A>the same thing both is and is not, and is bad and good, and that the contents 
<A NAME="283"></A>of all other opposite statements are true, because often a particular thing 
<A NAME="284"></A>appears beautiful to some and the contrary of beautiful to others, and 
<A NAME="285"></A>that which appears to each man is the measure. This difficulty may be solved 
<A NAME="286"></A>by considering the source of this opinion. It seems to have arisen in some 
<A NAME="287"></A>cases from the doctrine of the natural philosophers, and in others from 
<A NAME="288"></A>the fact that all men have not the same views about the same things, but 
<A NAME="289"></A>a particular thing appears pleasant to some and the contrary of pleasant 
<A NAME="290"></A>to others. <BR><BR>"That nothing comes to be out of that which is not, 
<A NAME="291"></A>but everything out of that which is, is a dogma common to nearly all the 
<A NAME="292"></A>natural philosophers. Since, then, white cannot come to be if the perfectly 
<A NAME="293"></A>white and in no respect not-white existed before, that which becomes white 
<A NAME="294"></A>must come from that which is not white; so that it must come to be out 
<A NAME="295"></A>of that which is not (so they argue), unless the same thing was at the 
<A NAME="296"></A>beginning white and not-white. But it is not hard to solve this difficulty; 
<A NAME="297"></A>for we have said in our works on physics in what sense things that come 
<A NAME="298"></A>to be come to be from that which is not, and in what sense from that which 
<A NAME="299"></A>is. <BR><BR>"But to attend equally to the opinions and the fancies of disputing 
<A NAME="300"></A>parties is childish; for clearly one of them must be mistaken. And this 
<A NAME="301"></A>is evident from what happens in respect of sensation; for the same thing 
<A NAME="302"></A>never appears sweet to some and the contrary of sweet to others, unless 
<A NAME="303"></A>in the one case the sense-organ which discriminates the aforesaid flavours 
<A NAME="304"></A>has been perverted and injured. And if this is so the one party must be 
<A NAME="305"></A>taken to be the measure, and the other must not. And say the same of good 
<A NAME="306"></A>and bad, and beautiful and ugly, and all other such qualities. For to maintain 
<A NAME="307"></A>the view we are opposing is just like maintaining that the things that 
<A NAME="308"></A>appear to people who put their finger under their eye and make the object 
<A NAME="309"></A>appear two instead of one must be two (because they appear to be of that 
<A NAME="310"></A>number) and again one (for to those who do not interfere with their eye 
<A NAME="311"></A>the one object appears one). <BR><BR>"In general, it is absurd to make 
<A NAME="312"></A>the fact that the things of this earth are observed to change and never 
<A NAME="313"></A>to remain in the same state, the basis of our judgement about the truth. 
<A NAME="314"></A>For in pursuing the truth one must start from the things that are always 
<A NAME="315"></A>in the same state and suffer no change. Such are the heavenly bodies; for 
<A NAME="316"></A>these do not appear to be now of one nature and again of another, but are 
<A NAME="317"></A>manifestly always the same and share in no change. <BR><BR>"Further, if 
<A NAME="318"></A>there is movement, there is also something moved, and everything is moved 
<A NAME="319"></A>out of something and into something; it follows that that that which is 
<A NAME="320"></A>moved must first be in that out of which it is to be moved, and then not 
<A NAME="321"></A>be in it, and move into the other and come to be in it, and that the contradictory 
<A NAME="322"></A>statements are not true at the same time, as these thinkers assert they 
<A NAME="323"></A>are. <BR><BR>"And if the things of this earth continuously flow and move 
<A NAME="324"></A>in respect of quantity-if one were to suppose this, although it is not 
<A NAME="325"></A>true-why should they not endure in respect of quality? For the assertion 
<A NAME="326"></A>of contradictory statements about the same thing seems to have arisen largely 
<A NAME="327"></A>from the belief that the quantity of bodies does not endure, which, our 
<A NAME="328"></A>opponents hold, justifies them in saying that the same thing both is and 
<A NAME="329"></A>is not four cubits long. But essence depends on quality, and this is of 
<A NAME="330"></A>determinate nature, though quantity is of indeterminate. <BR><BR>"Further, 
<A NAME="331"></A>when the doctor orders people to take some particular food, why do they 
<A NAME="332"></A>take it? In what respect is 'this is bread' truer than 'this is not bread'? 
<A NAME="333"></A>And so it would make no difference whether one ate or not. But as a matter 
<A NAME="334"></A>of fact they take the food which is ordered, assuming that they know the 
<A NAME="335"></A>truth about it and that it is bread. Yet they should not, if there were 
<A NAME="336"></A>no fixed constant nature in sensible things, but all natures moved and 
<A NAME="337"></A>flowed for ever. <BR><BR>"Again, if we are always changing and never remain 
<A NAME="338"></A>the same, what wonder is it if to us, as to the sick, things never appear 
<A NAME="339"></A>the same? (For to them also, because they are not in the same condition 
<A NAME="340"></A>as when they were well, sensible qualities do not appear alike; yet, for 
<A NAME="341"></A>all that, the sensible things themselves need not share in any change, 
<A NAME="342"></A>though they produce different, and not identical, sensations in the sick. 
<A NAME="343"></A>And the same must surely happen to the healthy if the afore-said change 
<A NAME="344"></A>takes place.) But if we do not change but remain the same, there will be 
<A NAME="345"></A>something that endures. <BR><BR>"As for those to whom the difficulties 
<A NAME="346"></A>mentioned are suggested by reasoning, it is not easy to solve the difficulties 
<A NAME="347"></A>to their satisfaction, unless they will posit something and no longer demand 
<A NAME="348"></A>a reason for it; for it is only thus that all reasoning and all proof is 
<A NAME="349"></A>accomplished; if they posit nothing, they destroy discussion and all reasoning. 
<A NAME="350"></A>Therefore with such men there is no reasoning. But as for those who are 
<A NAME="351"></A>perplexed by the traditional difficulties, it is easy to meet them and 
<A NAME="352"></A>to dissipate the causes of their perplexity. This is evident from what 
<A NAME="353"></A>has been said. <BR><BR>"It is manifest, therefore, from these arguments 
<A NAME="354"></A>that contradictory statements cannot be truly made about the same subject 
<A NAME="355"></A>at one time, nor can contrary statements, because every contrariety depends 
<A NAME="356"></A>on privation. This is evident if we reduce the definitions of contraries 
<A NAME="357"></A>to their principle. <BR><BR>"Similarly, no intermediate between contraries 
<A NAME="358"></A>can be predicated of one and the same subject, of which one of the contraries 
<A NAME="359"></A>is predicated. If the subject is white we shall be wrong in saying it is 
<A NAME="360"></A>neither black nor white, for then it follows that it is and is not white; 
<A NAME="361"></A>for the second of the two terms we have put together is true of it, and 
<A NAME="362"></A>this is the contradictory of white. <BR><BR>"We could not be right, then, 
<A NAME="363"></A>in accepting the views either of Heraclitus or of Anaxagoras. If we were, 
<A NAME="364"></A>it would follow that contraries would be predicated of the same subject; 
<A NAME="365"></A>for when Anaxagoras says that in everything there is a part of everything, 
<A NAME="366"></A>he says nothing is sweet any more than it is bitter, and so with any other 
<A NAME="367"></A>pair of contraries, since in everything everything is present not potentially 
<A NAME="368"></A>only, but actually and separately. And similarly all statements cannot 
<A NAME="369"></A>be false nor all true, both because of many other difficulties which might 
<A NAME="370"></A>be adduced as arising from this position, and because if all are false 
<A NAME="371"></A>it will not be true to say even this, and if all are true it will not be 
<A NAME="372"></A>false to say all are false.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="373"></A><B>Part 7</B>
<A NAME="374"></A>"<BR><BR>
<A NAME="375"></A><BR><BR>"Every science seeks certain principles and causes for each of 
<A NAME="376"></A>its objects-e.g. medicine and gymnastics and each of the other sciences, 
<A NAME="377"></A>whether productive or mathematical. For each of these marks off a certain 
<A NAME="378"></A>class of things for itself and busies itself about this as about something 
<A NAME="379"></A>existing and real,-not however qua real; the science that does this is 
<A NAME="380"></A>another distinct from these. Of the sciences mentioned each gets somehow 
<A NAME="381"></A>the 'what' in some class of things and tries to prove the other truths, 
<A NAME="382"></A>with more or less precision. Some get the 'what' through perception, others 
<A NAME="383"></A>by hypothesis; so that it is clear from an induction of this sort that 
<A NAME="384"></A>there is no demonstration. of the substance or 'what'. <BR><BR>"There is 
<A NAME="385"></A>a science of nature, and evidently it must be different both from practical 
<A NAME="386"></A>and from productive science. For in the case of productive science the 
<A NAME="387"></A>principle of movement is in the producer and not in the product, and is 
<A NAME="388"></A>either an art or some other faculty. And similarly in practical science 
<A NAME="389"></A>the movement is not in the thing done, but rather in the doers. But the 
<A NAME="390"></A>science of the natural philosopher deals with the things that have in themselves 
<A NAME="391"></A>a principle of movement. It is clear from these facts, then, that natural 
<A NAME="392"></A>science must be neither practical nor productive, but theoretical (for 
<A NAME="393"></A>it must fall into some one of these classes). And since each of the sciences 
<A NAME="394"></A>must somehow know the 'what' and use this as a principle, we must not fall 
<A NAME="395"></A>to observe how the natural philosopher should define things and how he 
<A NAME="396"></A>should state the definition of the essence-whether as akin to 'snub' or 
<A NAME="397"></A>rather to 'concave'. For of these the definition of 'snub' includes the 
<A NAME="398"></A>matter of the thing, but that of 'concave' is independent of the matter; 
<A NAME="399"></A>for snubness is found in a nose, so that we look for its definition without 
<A NAME="400"></A>eliminating the nose, for what is snub is a concave nose. Evidently then 
<A NAME="401"></A>the definition of flesh also and of the eye and of the other parts must 
<A NAME="402"></A>always be stated without eliminating the matter. <BR><BR>"Since there is 
<A NAME="403"></A>a science of being qua being and capable of existing apart, we must consider 
<A NAME="404"></A>whether this is to be regarded as the same as physics or rather as different. 
<A NAME="405"></A>Physics deals with the things that have a principle of movement in themselves; 
<A NAME="406"></A>mathematics is theoretical, and is a science that deals with things that 
<A NAME="407"></A>are at rest, but its subjects cannot exist apart. Therefore about that 
<A NAME="408"></A>which can exist apart and is unmovable there is a science different from 
<A NAME="409"></A>both of these, if there is a substance of this nature (I mean separable 
<A NAME="410"></A>and unmovable), as we shall try to prove there is. And if there is such 
<A NAME="411"></A>a kind of thing in the world, here must surely be the divine, and this 
<A NAME="412"></A>must be the first and most dominant principle. Evidently, then, there are 
<A NAME="413"></A>three kinds of theoretical sciences-physics, mathematics, theology. The 
<A NAME="414"></A>class of theoretical sciences is the best, and of these themselves the 
<A NAME="415"></A>last named is best; for it deals with the highest of existing things, and 
<A NAME="416"></A>each science is called better or worse in virtue of its proper object. 
<A NAME="417"></A><BR><BR>"One might raise the question whether the science of being qua 
<A NAME="418"></A>being is to be regarded as universal or not. Each of the mathematical sciences 
<A NAME="419"></A>deals with some one determinate class of things, but universal mathematics 
<A NAME="420"></A>applies alike to all. Now if natural substances are the first of existing 
<A NAME="421"></A>things, physics must be the first of sciences; but if there is another 
<A NAME="422"></A>entity and substance, separable and unmovable, the knowledge of it must 
<A NAME="423"></A>be different and prior to physics and universal because it is 
<A NAME="424"></A>prior.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="425"></A><B>Part 8</B>
<A NAME="426"></A>"<BR><BR>
<A NAME="427"></A><BR><BR>"Since 'being' in general has several senses, of which one is 'being 
<A NAME="428"></A>by accident', we must consider first that which 'is' in this sense. Evidently 
<A NAME="429"></A>none of the traditional sciences busies itself about the accidental. For 
<A NAME="430"></A>neither does architecture consider what will happen to those who are to 
<A NAME="431"></A>use the house (e.g. whether they have a painful life in it or not), nor 
<A NAME="432"></A>does weaving, or shoemaking, or the confectioner's art, do the like; but 
<A NAME="433"></A>each of these sciences considers only what is peculiar to it, i.e. its 
<A NAME="434"></A>proper end. And as for the argument that 'when he who is musical becomes 
<A NAME="435"></A>lettered he'll be both at once, not having been both before; and that which 
<A NAME="436"></A>is, not always having been, must have come to be; therefore he must have 
<A NAME="437"></A>at once become musical and lettered',-this none of the recognized sciences 
<A NAME="438"></A>considers, but only sophistic; for this alone busies itself about the accidental, 
<A NAME="439"></A>so that Plato is not far wrong when he says that the sophist spends his 
<A NAME="440"></A>time on non-being. <BR><BR>"That a science of the accidental is not even 
<A NAME="441"></A>possible will be evident if we try to see what the accidental really is. 
<A NAME="442"></A>We say that everything either is always and of necessity (necessity not 
<A NAME="443"></A>in the sense of violence, but that which we appeal to in demonstrations), 
<A NAME="444"></A>or is for the most part, or is neither for the most part, nor always and 
<A NAME="445"></A>of necessity, but merely as it chances; e.g. there might be cold in the 
<A NAME="446"></A>dogdays, but this occurs neither always and of necessity, nor for the most 
<A NAME="447"></A>part, though it might happen sometimes. The accidental, then, is what occurs, 
<A NAME="448"></A>but not always nor of necessity, nor for the most part. Now we have said 
<A NAME="449"></A>what the accidental is, and it is obvious why there is no science of such 
<A NAME="450"></A>a thing; for all science is of that which is always or for the most part, 
<A NAME="451"></A>but the accidental is in neither of these classes. <BR><BR>"Evidently there 
<A NAME="452"></A>are not causes and principles of the accidental, of the same kind as there 
<A NAME="453"></A>are of the essential; for if there were, everything would be of necessity. 
<A NAME="454"></A>If A is when B is, and B is when C is, and if C exists not by chance but 
<A NAME="455"></A>of necessity, that also of which C was cause will exist of necessity, down 
<A NAME="456"></A>to the last causatum as it is called (but this was supposed to be accidental). 
<A NAME="457"></A>Therefore all things will be of necessity, and chance and the possibility 
<A NAME="458"></A>of a thing's either occurring or not occurring are removed entirely from 
<A NAME="459"></A>the range of events. And if the cause be supposed not to exist but to be 
<A NAME="460"></A>coming to be, the same results will follow; everything will occur of necessity. 
<A NAME="461"></A>For to-morrow's eclipse will occur if A occurs, and A if B occurs, and 
<A NAME="462"></A>B if C occurs; and in this way if we subtract time from the limited time 
<A NAME="463"></A>between now and to-morrow we shall come sometime to the already existing 
<A NAME="464"></A>condition. Therefore since this exists, everything after this will occur 
<A NAME="465"></A>of necessity, so that all things occur of necessity. <BR><BR>"As to that 
<A NAME="466"></A>which 'is' in the sense of being true or of being by accident, the former 
<A NAME="467"></A>depends on a combination in thought and is an affection of thought (which 
<A NAME="468"></A>is the reason why it is the principles, not of that which 'is' in this 
<A NAME="469"></A>sense, but of that which is outside and can exist apart, that are sought); 
<A NAME="470"></A>and the latter is not necessary but indeterminate (I mean the accidental); 
<A NAME="471"></A>and of such a thing the causes are unordered and indefinite. <BR><BR>"Adaptation 
<A NAME="472"></A>to an end is found in events that happen by nature or as the result of 
<A NAME="473"></A>thought. It is 'luck' when one of these events happens by accident. For 
<A NAME="474"></A>as a thing may exist, so it may be a cause, either by its own nature or 
<A NAME="475"></A>by accident. Luck is an accidental cause at work in such events adapted 
<A NAME="476"></A>to an end as are usually effected in accordance with purpose. And so luck 
<A NAME="477"></A>and thought are concerned with the same sphere; for purpose cannot exist 
<A NAME="478"></A>without thought. The causes from which lucky results might happen are indeterminate; 
<A NAME="479"></A>and so luck is obscure to human calculation and is a cause by accident, 
<A NAME="480"></A>but in the unqualified sense a cause of nothing. It is good or bad luck 
<A NAME="481"></A>when the result is good or evil; and prosperity or misfortune when the 
<A NAME="482"></A>scale of the results is large. <BR><BR>"Since nothing accidental is prior 
<A NAME="483"></A>to the essential, neither are accidental causes prior. If, then, luck or 
<A NAME="484"></A>spontaneity is a cause of the material universe, reason and nature are 
<A NAME="485"></A>causes before it.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="486"></A><B>Part 9</B>
<A NAME="487"></A>"<BR><BR>
<A NAME="488"></A><BR><BR>"Some things are only actually, some potentially, some potentially 
<A NAME="489"></A>and actually, what they are, viz. in one case a particular reality, in 
<A NAME="490"></A>another, characterized by a particular quantity, or the like. There is 
<A NAME="491"></A>no movement apart from things; for change is always according to the categories 
<A NAME="492"></A>of being, and there is nothing common to these and in no one category. 
<A NAME="493"></A>But each of the categories belongs to all its subjects in either of two 
<A NAME="494"></A>ways (e.g. 'this-ness'-for one kind of it is 'positive form', and the other 
<A NAME="495"></A>is 'privation'; and as regards quality one kind is 'white' and the other 
<A NAME="496"></A>'black', and as regards quantity one kind is 'complete' and the other 'incomplete', 
<A NAME="497"></A>and as regards spatial movement one is 'upwards' and the other 'downwards', 
<A NAME="498"></A>or one thing is 'light' and another 'heavy'); so that there are as many 
<A NAME="499"></A>kinds of movement and change as of being. There being a distinction in 
<A NAME="500"></A>each class of things between the potential and the completely real, I call 
<A NAME="501"></A>the actuality of the potential as such, movement. That what we say is true, 
<A NAME="502"></A>is plain from the following facts. When the 'buildable', in so far as it 
<A NAME="503"></A>is what we mean by 'buildable', exists actually, it is being built, and 
<A NAME="504"></A>this is the process of building. Similarly with learning, healing, walking, 
<A NAME="505"></A>leaping, ageing, ripening. Movement takes when the complete reality itself 
<A NAME="506"></A>exists, and neither earlier nor later. The complete reality, then, of that 
<A NAME="507"></A>which exists potentially, when it is completely real and actual, not qua 
<A NAME="508"></A>itself, but qua movable, is movement. By qua I mean this: bronze is potentially 
<A NAME="509"></A>a statue; but yet it is not the complete reality of bronze qua bronze that 
<A NAME="510"></A>is movement. For it is not the same thing to be bronze and to be a certain 
<A NAME="511"></A>potency. If it were absolutely the same in its definition, the complete 
<A NAME="512"></A>reality of bronze would have been a movement. But it is not the same. (This 
<A NAME="513"></A>is evident in the case of contraries; for to be capable of being well and 
<A NAME="514"></A>to be capable of being ill are not the same-for if they were, being well 
<A NAME="515"></A>and being ill would have been the same-it is that which underlies and is 
<A NAME="516"></A>healthy or diseased, whether it is moisture or blood, that is one and the 
<A NAME="517"></A>same.) And since it is not. the same, as colour and the visible are not 
<A NAME="518"></A>the same, it is the complete reality of the potential, and as potential, 
<A NAME="519"></A>that is movement. That it is this, and that movement takes place when the 
<A NAME="520"></A>complete reality itself exists, and neither earlier nor later, is evident. 
<A NAME="521"></A>For each thing is capable of being sometimes actual, sometimes not, e.g. 
<A NAME="522"></A>the buildable qua buildable; and the actuality of the buildable qua buildable 
<A NAME="523"></A>is building. For the actuality is either this-the act of building-or the 
<A NAME="524"></A>house. But when the house exists, it is no longer buildable; the buildable 
<A NAME="525"></A>is what is being built. The actuality, then, must be the act of building, 
<A NAME="526"></A>and this is a movement. And the same account applies to all other movements. 
<A NAME="527"></A><BR><BR>"That what we have said is right is evident from what all others 
<A NAME="528"></A>say about movement, and from the fact that it is not easy to define it 
<A NAME="529"></A>otherwise. For firstly one cannot put it in any class. This is evident 
<A NAME="530"></A>from what people say. Some call it otherness and inequality and the unreal; 
<A NAME="531"></A>none of these, however, is necessarily moved, and further, change is not 
<A NAME="532"></A>either to these or from these any more than from their opposites. The reason 
<A NAME="533"></A>why people put movement in these classes is that it is thought to be something 
<A NAME="534"></A>indefinite, and the principles in one of the two 'columns of contraries' 
<A NAME="535"></A>are indefinite because they are privative, for none of them is either a 
<A NAME="536"></A>'this' or a 'such' or in any of the other categories. And the reason why 
<A NAME="537"></A>movement is thought to be indefinite is that it cannot be classed either 
<A NAME="538"></A>with the potency of things or with their actuality; for neither that which 
<A NAME="539"></A>is capable of being of a certain quantity, nor that which is actually of 
<A NAME="540"></A>a certain quantity, is of necessity moved, and movement is thought to be 
<A NAME="541"></A>an actuality, but incomplete; the reason is that the potential, whose actuality 
<A NAME="542"></A>it is, is incomplete. And therefore it is hard to grasp what movement is; 
<A NAME="543"></A>for it must be classed either under privation or under potency or under 
<A NAME="544"></A>absolute actuality, but evidently none of these is possible. Therefore 
<A NAME="545"></A>what remains is that it must be what we said-both actuality and the actuality 
<A NAME="546"></A>we have described-which is hard to detect but capable of existing. <BR><BR>"And 
<A NAME="547"></A>evidently movement is in the movable; for it is the complete realization 
<A NAME="548"></A>of this by that which is capable of causing movement. And the actuality 
<A NAME="549"></A>of that which is capable of causing movement is no other than that of the 
<A NAME="550"></A>movable. For it must be the complete reality of both. For while a thing 
<A NAME="551"></A>is capable of causing movement because it can do this, it is a mover because 
<A NAME="552"></A>it is active; but it is on the movable that it is capable of acting, so 
<A NAME="553"></A>that the actuality of both is one, just as there is the same interval from 
<A NAME="554"></A>one to two as from two to one, and as the steep ascent and the steep descent 
<A NAME="555"></A>are one, but the being of them is not one; the case of the mover and the 
<A NAME="556"></A>moved is similar.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="557"></A><B>Part 10</B>
<A NAME="558"></A>"<BR><BR>
<A NAME="559"></A><BR><BR>"The infinite is either that which is incapable of being traversed 
<A NAME="560"></A>because it is not its nature to be traversed (this corresponds to the sense 
<A NAME="561"></A>in which the voice is 'invisible'), or that which admits only of incomplete 
<A NAME="562"></A>traverse or scarcely admits of traverse, or that which, though it naturally 
<A NAME="563"></A>admits of traverse, is not traversed or limited; further, a thing may be 
<A NAME="564"></A>infinite in respect of addition or of subtraction, or both. The infinite 
<A NAME="565"></A>cannot be a separate, independent thing. For if it is neither a spatial 
<A NAME="566"></A>magnitude nor a plurality, but infinity itself is its substance and not 
<A NAME="567"></A>an accident of it, it will be indivisible; for the divisible is either 
<A NAME="568"></A>magnitude or plurality. But if indivisible, it is not infinite, except 
<A NAME="569"></A>as the voice is invisible; but people do not mean this, nor are we examining 
<A NAME="570"></A>this sort of infinite, but the infinite as untraversable. Further, how 
<A NAME="571"></A>can an infinite exist by itself, unless number and magnitude also exist 
<A NAME="572"></A>by themselvess-since infinity is an attribute of these? Further, if the 
<A NAME="573"></A>infinite is an accident of something else, it cannot be qua infinite an 
<A NAME="574"></A>element in things, as the invisible is not an element in speech, though 
<A NAME="575"></A>the voice is invisible. And evidently the infinite cannot exist actually. 
<A NAME="576"></A>For then any part of it that might be taken would be infinite (for 'to 
<A NAME="577"></A>be infinite' and 'the infinite' are the same, if the infinite is substance 
<A NAME="578"></A>and not predicated of a subject). Therefore it is either indivisible, or 
<A NAME="579"></A>if it is partible, it is divisible into infinites; but the same thing cannot 
<A NAME="580"></A>be many infinites (as a part of air is air, so a part of the infinite would 
<A NAME="581"></A>be infinite, if the infinite is substance and a principle). Therefore it 
<A NAME="582"></A>must be impartible and indivisible. But the actually infinite cannot be 
<A NAME="583"></A>indivisible; for it must be of a certain quantity. Therefore infinity belongs 
<A NAME="584"></A>to its subject incidentally. But if so, then (as we have said) it cannot 
<A NAME="585"></A>be it that is a principle, but that of which it is an accident-the air 
<A NAME="586"></A>or the even number. <BR><BR>"This inquiry is universal; but that the infinite 
<A NAME="587"></A>is not among sensible things, is evident from the following argument. If 
<A NAME="588"></A>the definition of a body is 'that which is bounded by planes', there cannot 
<A NAME="589"></A>be an infinite body either sensible or intelligible; nor a separate and 
<A NAME="590"></A>infinite number, for number or that which has a number is numerable. Concretely, 
<A NAME="591"></A>the truth is evident from the following argument. The infinite can neither 
<A NAME="592"></A>be composite nor simple. For (a) it cannot be a composite body, since the 
<A NAME="593"></A>elements are limited in multitude. For the contraries must be equal and 
<A NAME="594"></A>no one of them must be infinite; for if one of the two bodies falls at 
<A NAME="595"></A>all short of the other in potency, the finite will be destroyed by the 
<A NAME="596"></A>infinite. And that each should be infinite is impossible. For body is that 
<A NAME="597"></A>which has extension in all directions, and the infinite is the boundlessly 
<A NAME="598"></A>extended, so that if the infinite is a body it will be infinite in every 
<A NAME="599"></A>direction. Nor (b) can the infinite body be one and simple-neither, as 
<A NAME="600"></A>some say, something apart from the elements, from which they generate these 
<A NAME="601"></A>(for there is no such body apart from the elements; for everything can 
<A NAME="602"></A>be resolved into that of which it consists, but no such product of analysis 
<A NAME="603"></A>is observed except the simple bodies), nor fire nor any other of the elements. 
<A NAME="604"></A>For apart from the question how any of them could be infinite, the All, 
<A NAME="605"></A>even if it is finite, cannot either be or become any one of them, as Heraclitus 
<A NAME="606"></A>says all things sometime become fire. The same argument applies to this 
<A NAME="607"></A>as to the One which the natural philosophers posit besides the elements. 
<A NAME="608"></A>For everything changes from contrary to contrary, e.g. from hot to cold. 
<A NAME="609"></A><BR><BR>"Further, a sensible body is somewhere, and whole and part have 
<A NAME="610"></A>the same proper place, e.g. the whole earth and part of the earth. Therefore 
<A NAME="611"></A>if (a) the infinite body is homogeneous, it will be unmovable or it will 
<A NAME="612"></A>be always moving. But this is impossible; for why should it rather rest, 
<A NAME="613"></A>or move, down, up, or anywhere, rather than anywhere else? E.g. if there 
<A NAME="614"></A>were a clod which were part of an infinite body, where will this move or 
<A NAME="615"></A>rest? The proper place of the body which is homogeneous with it is infinite. 
<A NAME="616"></A>Will the clod occupy the whole place, then? And how? (This is impossible.) 
<A NAME="617"></A>What then is its rest or its movement? It will either rest everywhere, 
<A NAME="618"></A>and then it cannot move; or it will move everywhere, and then it cannot 
<A NAME="619"></A>be still. But (b) if the All has unlike parts, the proper places of the 
<A NAME="620"></A>parts are unlike also, and, firstly, the body of the All is not one except 
<A NAME="621"></A>by contact, and, secondly, the parts will be either finite or infinite 
<A NAME="622"></A>in variety of kind. Finite they cannot be; for then those of one kind will 
<A NAME="623"></A>be infinite in quantity and those of another will not (if the All is infinite), 
<A NAME="624"></A>e.g. fire or water would be infinite, but such an infinite element would 
<A NAME="625"></A>be destruction to the contrary elements. But if the parts are infinite 
<A NAME="626"></A>and simple, their places also are infinite and there will be an infinite 
<A NAME="627"></A>number of elements; and if this is impossible, and the places are finite, 
<A NAME="628"></A>the All also must be limited. <BR><BR>"In general, there cannot be an infinite 
<A NAME="629"></A>body and also a proper place for bodies, if every sensible body has either 
<A NAME="630"></A>weight or lightness. For it must move either towards the middle or upwards, 
<A NAME="631"></A>and the infinite either the whole or the half of it-cannot do either; for 
<A NAME="632"></A>how will you divide it? Or how will part of the infinite be down and part 
<A NAME="633"></A>up, or part extreme and part middle? Further, every sensible body is in 
<A NAME="634"></A>a place, and there are six kinds of place, but these cannot exist in an 
<A NAME="635"></A>infinite body. In general, if there cannot be an infinite place, there 
<A NAME="636"></A>cannot be an infinite body; (and there cannot be an infinite place,) for 
<A NAME="637"></A>that which is in a place is somewhere, and this means either up or down 
<A NAME="638"></A>or in one of the other directions, and each of these is a limit. <BR><BR>"The 
<A NAME="639"></A>infinite is not the same in the sense that it is a single thing whether 
<A NAME="640"></A>exhibited in distance or in movement or in time, but the posterior among 
<A NAME="641"></A>these is called infinite in virtue of its relation to the prior; i.e. a 
<A NAME="642"></A>movement is called infinite in virtue of the distance covered by the spatial 
<A NAME="643"></A>movement or alteration or growth, and a time is called infinite because 
<A NAME="644"></A>of the movement which occupies it.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="645"></A><B>Part 11</B>
<A NAME="646"></A>"<BR><BR>
<A NAME="647"></A><BR><BR>"Of things which change, some change in an accidental sense, like 
<A NAME="648"></A>that in which 'the musical' may be said to walk, and others are said, without 
<A NAME="649"></A>qualification, to change, because something in them changes, i.e. the things 
<A NAME="650"></A>that change in parts; the body becomes healthy, because the eye does. But 
<A NAME="651"></A>there is something which is by its own nature moved directly, and this 
<A NAME="652"></A>is the essentially movable. The same distinction is found in the case of 
<A NAME="653"></A>the mover; for it causes movement either in an accidental sense or in respect 
<A NAME="654"></A>of a part of itself or essentially. There is something that directly causes 
<A NAME="655"></A>movement; and there is something that is moved, also the time in which 
<A NAME="656"></A>it is moved, and that from which and that into which it is moved. But the 
<A NAME="657"></A>forms and the affections and the place, which are the terminals of the 
<A NAME="658"></A>movement of moving things, are unmovable, e.g. knowledge or heat; it is 
<A NAME="659"></A>not heat that is a movement, but heating. Change which is not accidental 
<A NAME="660"></A>is found not in all things, but between contraries, and their intermediates, 
<A NAME="661"></A>and between contradictories. We may convince ourselves of this by induction. 
<A NAME="662"></A><BR><BR>"That which changes changes either from positive into positive, 
<A NAME="663"></A>or from negative into negative, or from positive into negative, or from 
<A NAME="664"></A>negative into positive. (By positive I mean that which is expressed by 
<A NAME="665"></A>an affirmative term.) Therefore there must be three changes; that from 
<A NAME="666"></A>negative into negative is not change, because (since the terms are neither 
<A NAME="667"></A>contraries nor contradictories) there is no opposition. The change from 
<A NAME="668"></A>the negative into the positive which is its contradictory is generation-absolute 
<A NAME="669"></A>change absolute generation, and partial change partial generation; and 
<A NAME="670"></A>the change from positive to negative is destruction-absolute change absolute 
<A NAME="671"></A>destruction, and partial change partial destruction. If, then, 'that which 
<A NAME="672"></A>is not' has several senses, and movement can attach neither to that which 
<A NAME="673"></A>implies putting together or separating, nor to that which implies potency 
<A NAME="674"></A>and is opposed to that which is in the full sense (true, the not-white 
<A NAME="675"></A>or not-good can be moved incidentally, for the not-white might be a man; 
<A NAME="676"></A>but that which is not a particular thing at all can in no wise be moved), 
<A NAME="677"></A>that which is not cannot be moved (and if this is so, generation cannot 
<A NAME="678"></A>be movement; for that which is not is generated; for even if we admit to 
<A NAME="679"></A>the full that its generation is accidental, yet it is true to say that 
<A NAME="680"></A>'not-being' is predicable of that which is generated absolutely). Similarly 
<A NAME="681"></A>rest cannot be long to that which is not. These consequences, then, turn 
<A NAME="682"></A>out to be awkward, and also this, that everything that is moved is in a 
<A NAME="683"></A>place, but that which is not is not in a place; for then it would be somewhere. 
<A NAME="684"></A>Nor is destruction movement; for the contrary of movement is rest, but 
<A NAME="685"></A>the contrary of destruction is generation. Since every movement is a change, 
<A NAME="686"></A>and the kinds of change are the three named above, and of these those in 
<A NAME="687"></A>the way of generation and destruction are not movements, and these are 
<A NAME="688"></A>the changes from a thing to its contradictory, it follows that only the 
<A NAME="689"></A>change from positive into positive is movement. And the positives are either 
<A NAME="690"></A>contrary or intermediate (for even privation must be regarded as contrary), 
<A NAME="691"></A>and are expressed by an affirmative term, e.g. 'naked' or 'toothless' or 
<A NAME="692"></A>'black'.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="693"></A><B>Part 12</B>
<A NAME="694"></A>"<BR><BR>
<A NAME="695"></A><BR><BR>"If the categories are classified as substance, quality, place, 
<A NAME="696"></A>acting or being acted on, relation, quantity, there must be three kinds 
<A NAME="697"></A>of movement-of quality, of quantity, of place. There is no movement in 
<A NAME="698"></A>respect of substance (because there is nothing contrary to substance), 
<A NAME="699"></A>nor of relation (for it is possible that if one of two things in relation 
<A NAME="700"></A>changes, the relative term which was true of the other thing ceases to 
<A NAME="701"></A>be true, though this other does not change at all,-so that their movement 
<A NAME="702"></A>is accidental), nor of agent and patient, or mover and moved, because there 
<A NAME="703"></A>is no movement of movement nor generation of generation, nor, in general, 
<A NAME="704"></A>change of change. For there might be movement of movement in two senses; 
<A NAME="705"></A>(1) movement might be the subject moved, as a man is moved because he changes 
<A NAME="706"></A>from pale to dark,-so that on this showing movement, too, may be either 
<A NAME="707"></A>heated or cooled or change its place or increase. But this is impossible; 
<A NAME="708"></A>for change is not a subject. Or (2) some other subject might change from 
<A NAME="709"></A>change into some other form of existence (e.g. a man from disease into 
<A NAME="710"></A>health). But this also is not possible except incidentally. For every movement 
<A NAME="711"></A>is change from something into something. (And so are generation and destruction; 
<A NAME="712"></A>only, these are changes into things opposed in certain ways while the other, 
<A NAME="713"></A>movement, is into things opposed in another way.) A thing changes, then, 
<A NAME="714"></A>at the same time from health into illness, and from this change itself 
<A NAME="715"></A>into another. Clearly, then, if it has become ill, it will have changed 
<A NAME="716"></A>into whatever may be the other change concerned (though it may be at rest), 
<A NAME="717"></A>and, further, into a determinate change each time; and that new change 
<A NAME="718"></A>will be from something definite into some other definite thing; therefore 
<A NAME="719"></A>it will be the opposite change, that of growing well. We answer that this 
<A NAME="720"></A>happens only incidentally; e.g. there is a change from the process of recollection 
<A NAME="721"></A>to that of forgetting, only because that to which the process attaches 
<A NAME="722"></A>is changing, now into a state of knowledge, now into one of ignorance. 
<A NAME="723"></A><BR><BR>"Further, the process will go on to infinity, if there is to be 
<A NAME="724"></A>change of change and coming to be of coming to be. What is true of the 
<A NAME="725"></A>later, then, must be true of the earlier; e.g. if the simple coming to 
<A NAME="726"></A>be was once coming to be, that which comes to be something was also once 
<A NAME="727"></A>coming to be; therefore that which simply comes to be something was not 
<A NAME="728"></A>yet in existence, but something which was coming to be coming to be something 
<A NAME="729"></A>was already in existence. And this was once coming to be, so that at that 
<A NAME="730"></A>time it was not yet coming to be something else. Now since of an infinite 
<A NAME="731"></A>number of terms there is not a first, the first in this series will not 
<A NAME="732"></A>exist, and therefore no following term exist. Nothing, then, can either 
<A NAME="733"></A>come term wi to be or move or change. Further, that which is capable of 
<A NAME="734"></A>a movement is also capable of the contrary movement and rest, and that 
<A NAME="735"></A>which comes to be also ceases to be. Therefore that which is coming to 
<A NAME="736"></A>be is ceasing to be when it has come to be coming to be; for it cannot 
<A NAME="737"></A>cease to be as soon as it is coming to be coming to be, nor after it has 
<A NAME="738"></A>come to be; for that which is ceasing to be must be. Further, there must 
<A NAME="739"></A>be a matter underlying that which comes to be and changes. What will this 
<A NAME="740"></A>be, then,-what is it that becomes movement or becoming, as body or soul 
<A NAME="741"></A>is that which suffers alteration? And; again, what is it that they move 
<A NAME="742"></A>into? For it must be the movement or becoming of something from something 
<A NAME="743"></A>into something. How, then, can this condition be fulfilled? There can be 
<A NAME="744"></A>no learning of learning, and therefore no becoming of becoming. Since there 
<A NAME="745"></A>is not movement either of substance or of relation or of activity and passivity, 
<A NAME="746"></A>it remains that movement is in respect of quality and quantity and place; 
<A NAME="747"></A>for each of these admits of contrariety. By quality I mean not that which 
<A NAME="748"></A>is in the substance (for even the differentia is a quality), but the passive 
<A NAME="749"></A>quality, in virtue of which a thing is said to be acted on or to be incapable 
<A NAME="750"></A>of being acted on. The immobile is either that which is wholly incapable 
<A NAME="751"></A>of being moved, or that which is moved with difficulty in a long time or 
<A NAME="752"></A>begins slowly, or that which is of a nature to be moved and can be moved 
<A NAME="753"></A>but is not moved when and where and as it would naturally be moved. This 
<A NAME="754"></A>alone among immobiles I describe as being at rest; for rest is contrary 
<A NAME="755"></A>to movement, so that it must be a privation in that which is receptive 
<A NAME="756"></A>of movement. <BR><BR>"Things which are in one proximate place are together 
<A NAME="757"></A>in place, and things which are in different places are apart: things whose 
<A NAME="758"></A>extremes are together touch: that at which a changing thing, if it changes 
<A NAME="759"></A>continuously according to its nature, naturally arrives before it arrives 
<A NAME="760"></A>at the extreme into which it is changing, is between. That which is most 
<A NAME="761"></A>distant in a straight line is contrary in place. That is successive which 
<A NAME="762"></A>is after the beginning (the order being determined by position or form 
<A NAME="763"></A>or in some other way) and has nothing of the same class between it and 
<A NAME="764"></A>that which it succeeds, e.g. lines in the case of a line, units in that 
<A NAME="765"></A>of a unit, or a house in that of a house. (There is nothing to prevent 
<A NAME="766"></A>a thing of some other class from being between.) For the successive succeeds 
<A NAME="767"></A>something and is something later; 'one' does not succeed 'two', nor the 
<A NAME="768"></A>first day of the month the second. That which, being successive, touches, 
<A NAME="769"></A>is contiguous. (Since all change is between opposites, and these are either 
<A NAME="770"></A>contraries or contradictories, and there is no middle term for contradictories, 
<A NAME="771"></A>clearly that which is between is between contraries.) The continuous is 
<A NAME="772"></A>a species of the contiguous. I call two things continuous when the limits 
<A NAME="773"></A>of each, with which they touch and by which they are kept together, become 
<A NAME="774"></A>one and the same, so that plainly the continuous is found in the things 
<A NAME="775"></A>out of which a unity naturally arises in virtue of their contact. And plainly 
<A NAME="776"></A>the successive is the first of these concepts (for the successive does 
<A NAME="777"></A>not necessarily touch, but that which touches is successive; and if a thing 
<A NAME="778"></A>is continuous, it touches, but if it touches, it is not necessarily continuous; 
<A NAME="779"></A>and in things in which there is no touching, there is no organic unity); 
<A NAME="780"></A>therefore a point is not the same as a unit; for contact belongs to points, 
<A NAME="781"></A>but not to units, which have only succession; and there is something between 
<A NAME="782"></A>two of the former, but not between two of the latter.
