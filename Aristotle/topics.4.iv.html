<A NAME="10"></A><B>Part 1</B>
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="11"></A>Next we must go on to examine questions relating to Genus and Property. 
<A NAME="12"></A>These are elements in the questions that relate to definitions, but dialecticians 
<A NAME="13"></A>seldom address their inquiries to these by themselves. If, then, a genus 
<A NAME="14"></A>be suggested for something that is, first take a look at all objects which 
<A NAME="15"></A>belong to the same genus as the thing mentioned, and see whether the genus 
<A NAME="16"></A>suggested is not predicated of one of them, as happens in the case of an 
<A NAME="17"></A>accident: e.g. if 'good' be laid down to be the genus of 'pleasure', see 
<A NAME="18"></A>whether some particular pleasure be not good: for, if so, clearly good' 
<A NAME="19"></A>is not the genus of pleasure: for the genus is predicated of all the members 
<A NAME="20"></A>of the same species. Secondly, see whether it be predicated not in the 
<A NAME="21"></A>category of essence, but as an accident, as 'white' is predicated of 'snow', 
<A NAME="22"></A>or 'self-moved' of the soul. For 'snow' is not a kind of 'white', and therefore 
<A NAME="23"></A>'white' is not the genus of snow, nor is the soul a kind of 'moving object': 
<A NAME="24"></A>its motion is an accident of it, as it often is of an animal to walk or 
<A NAME="25"></A>to be walking. Moreover, 'moving' does not seem to indicate the essence, 
<A NAME="26"></A>but rather a state of doing or of having something done to it. Likewise, 
<A NAME="27"></A>also, 'white': for it indicates not the essence of snow, but a certain 
<A NAME="28"></A>quality of it. So that neither of them is predicated in the category of 
<A NAME="29"></A>'essence'.
<A NAME="30"></A><BR><BR>Especially you should take a look at the definition of Accident, 
<A NAME="31"></A>and see whether it fits the genus mentioned, as (e.g.) is also the case 
<A NAME="32"></A>in the instances just given. For it is possible for a thing to be and not 
<A NAME="33"></A>to be self-moved, and likewise, also, for it to be and not to be white. 
<A NAME="34"></A>So that neither of these attributes is the genus but an accident, since 
<A NAME="35"></A>we were saying that an accident is an attribute which can belong to a thing 
<A NAME="36"></A>and also not belong.
<A NAME="37"></A><BR><BR>Moreover, see whether the genus and the species be not found in 
<A NAME="38"></A>the same division, but the one be a substance while the other is a quality, 
<A NAME="39"></A>or the one be a relative while the other is a quality, as (e.g.) 'slow' 
<A NAME="40"></A>and 'swan' are each a substance, while 'white' is not a substance but a 
<A NAME="41"></A>quality, so that 'white' is not the genus either of 'snow' or of 'swan'. 
<A NAME="42"></A>Again, knowledge' is a relative, while 'good' and 'noble' are each a quality, 
<A NAME="43"></A>so that good, or noble, is not the genus of knowledge. For the genera of 
<A NAME="44"></A>relatives ought themselves also to be relatives, as is the case with 'double': 
<A NAME="45"></A>for multiple', which is the genus of 'double', is itself also a relative. 
<A NAME="46"></A>To speak generally, the genus ought to fall under the same division as 
<A NAME="47"></A>the species: for if the species be a substance, so too should be the genus, 
<A NAME="48"></A>and if the species be a quality, so too the genus should be a quality; 
<A NAME="49"></A>e.g. if white be a quality, so too should colour be. Likewise, also, in 
<A NAME="50"></A>other cases.
<A NAME="51"></A><BR><BR>Again, see whether it be necessary or possible for the genus to 
<A NAME="52"></A>partake of the object which has been placed in the genus. 'To partake' 
<A NAME="53"></A>is defined as 'to admit the definition of that which is partaken. Clearly, 
<A NAME="54"></A>therefore, the species partake of the genera, but not the genera of the 
<A NAME="55"></A>species: for the species admits the definition of the genus, whereas the 
<A NAME="56"></A>genus does not admit that of the species. You must look, therefore, and 
<A NAME="57"></A>see whether the genus rendered partakes or can possibly partake of the 
<A NAME="58"></A>species, e.g. if any one were to render anything as genus of 'being' or 
<A NAME="59"></A>of 'unity': for then the result will be that the genus partakes of the 
<A NAME="60"></A>species: for of everything that is, 'being' and 'unity' are predicated, 
<A NAME="61"></A>and therefore their definition as well.
<A NAME="62"></A><BR><BR>Moreover, see if there be anything of which the species rendered 
<A NAME="63"></A>is true, while the genus is not so, e.g. supposing 'being' or 'object of 
<A NAME="64"></A>knowledge' were stated to be the genus of 'object of opinion'. For 'object 
<A NAME="65"></A>of opinion' will be a predicate of what does not exist; for many things 
<A NAME="66"></A>which do not exist are objects of opinion; whereas that 'being' or 'object 
<A NAME="67"></A>of knowledge' is not predicated of what does not exist is clear. So that 
<A NAME="68"></A>neither 'being' nor 'object of knowledge' is the genus of 'object of opinion': 
<A NAME="69"></A>for of the objects of which the species is predicated, the genus ought 
<A NAME="70"></A>to be predicated as well.
<A NAME="71"></A><BR><BR>Again, see whether the object placed in the genus be quite unable 
<A NAME="72"></A>to partake of any of its species: for it is impossible that it should partake 
<A NAME="73"></A>of the genus if it do not partake of any of its species, except it be one 
<A NAME="74"></A>of the species reached by the first division: these do partake of the genus 
<A NAME="75"></A>alone. If, therefore, 'Motion' be stated as the genus of pleasure, you 
<A NAME="76"></A>should look and see if pleasure be neither locomotion nor alteration, nor 
<A NAME="77"></A>any of the rest of the given modes of motion: for clearly you may then 
<A NAME="78"></A>take it that it does not partake of any of the species, and therefore not 
<A NAME="79"></A>of the genus either, since what partakes of the genus must necessarily 
<A NAME="80"></A>partake of one of the species as well: so that pleasure could not be a 
<A NAME="81"></A>species of Motion, nor yet be one of the individual phenomena comprised 
<A NAME="82"></A>under the term 'motion'. For individuals as well partake in the genus and 
<A NAME="83"></A>the species, as (e.g.) an individual man partakes of both 'man' and 
<A NAME="84"></A>'animal'.
<A NAME="85"></A><BR><BR>Moreover, see if the term placed in the genus has a wider denotation 
<A NAME="86"></A>than the genus, as (e.g.) 'object of opinion' has, as compared with 'being': 
<A NAME="87"></A>for both what is and what is not are objects of opinion, so that 'object 
<A NAME="88"></A>of opinion' could not be a species of being: for the genus is always of 
<A NAME="89"></A>wider denotation than the species. Again, see if the species and its genus 
<A NAME="90"></A>have an equal denotation; suppose, for instance, that of the attributes 
<A NAME="91"></A>which go with everything, one were to be stated as a species and the other 
<A NAME="92"></A>as its genus, as for example Being and Unity: for everything has being 
<A NAME="93"></A>and unity, so that neither is the genus of the other, since their denotation 
<A NAME="94"></A>is equal. Likewise, also, if the 'first' of a series and the 'beginning' 
<A NAME="95"></A>were to be placed one under the other: for the beginning is first and the 
<A NAME="96"></A>first is the beginning, so that either both expressions are identical or 
<A NAME="97"></A>at any rate neither is the genus of the other. The elementary principle 
<A NAME="98"></A>in regard to all such cases is that the genus has a wider denotation than 
<A NAME="99"></A>the species and its differentia: for the differentia as well has a narrower 
<A NAME="100"></A>denotation than the genus.
<A NAME="101"></A><BR><BR>See also whether the genus mentioned fails, or might be generally 
<A NAME="102"></A>thought to fail, to apply to some object which is not specifically different 
<A NAME="103"></A>from the thing in question; or, if your argument be constructive, whether 
<A NAME="104"></A>it does so apply. For all things that are not specifically different have 
<A NAME="105"></A>the same genus. If, therefore, it be shown to apply to one, then clearly 
<A NAME="106"></A>it applies to all, and if it fails to apply to one, clearly it fails to 
<A NAME="107"></A>apply to any; e.g. if any one who assumes 'indivisible lines' were to say 
<A NAME="108"></A>that the 'indivisible' is their genus. For the aforesaid term is not the 
<A NAME="109"></A>genus of divisible lines, and these do not differ as regards their species 
<A NAME="110"></A>from indivisible: for straight lines are never different from each other 
<A NAME="111"></A>as regards their species.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="112"></A><B>Part 2</B>

<A NAME="113"></A><BR><BR>Look and see, also, if there be any other genus of the given species 
<A NAME="114"></A>which neither embraces the genus rendered nor yet falls under it, e.g. 
<A NAME="115"></A>suppose any one were to lay down that 'knowledge' is the genus of justice. 
<A NAME="116"></A>For virtue is its genus as well, and neither of these genera embraces the 
<A NAME="117"></A>remaining one, so that knowledge could not be the genus of justice: for 
<A NAME="118"></A>it is generally accepted that whenever one species falls under two genera, 
<A NAME="119"></A>the one is embraced by the other. Yet a principle of this kind gives rise 
<A NAME="120"></A>to a difficulty in some cases. For some people hold that prudence is both 
<A NAME="121"></A>virtue and knowledge, and that neither of its genera is embraced by the 
<A NAME="122"></A>other: although certainly not everybody admits that prudence is knowledge. 
<A NAME="123"></A>If, however, any one were to admit the truth of this assertion, yet it 
<A NAME="124"></A>would still be generally agreed to be necessary that the genera of the 
<A NAME="125"></A>same object must at any rate be subordinate either the one to the other 
<A NAME="126"></A>or both to the same, as actually is the case with virtue and knowledge. 
<A NAME="127"></A>For both fall under the same genus; for each of them is a state and a disposition. 
<A NAME="128"></A>You should look, therefore, and see whether neither of these things is 
<A NAME="129"></A>true of the genus rendered; for if the genera be subordinate neither the 
<A NAME="130"></A>one to the other nor both to the same, then what is rendered could not 
<A NAME="131"></A>be the true genus.
<A NAME="132"></A><BR><BR>Look, also, at the genus of the genus rendered, and so continually 
<A NAME="133"></A>at the next higher genus, and see whether all are predicated of the species, 
<A NAME="134"></A>and predicated in the category of essence: for all the higher genera should 
<A NAME="135"></A>be predicated of the species in the category of essence. If, then, there 
<A NAME="136"></A>be anywhere a discrepancy, clearly what is rendered is not the true genus. 
<A NAME="137"></A>[Again, see whether either the genus itself, or one of its higher genera, 
<A NAME="138"></A>partakes of the species: for the higher genus does not partake of any of 
<A NAME="139"></A>the lower.] If, then, you are overthrowing a view, follow the rule as given: 
<A NAME="140"></A>if establishing one, then-suppose that what has been named as genus be 
<A NAME="141"></A>admitted to belong to the species, only it be disputed whether it belongs 
<A NAME="142"></A>as genus-it is enough to show that one of its higher genera is predicated 
<A NAME="143"></A>of the species in the category of essence. For if one of them be predicated 
<A NAME="144"></A>in the category of essence, all of them, both higher and lower than this 
<A NAME="145"></A>one, if predicated at all of the species, will be predicated of it in the 
<A NAME="146"></A>category of essence: so that what has been rendered as genus is also predicated 
<A NAME="147"></A>in the category of essence. The premiss that when one genus is predicated 
<A NAME="148"></A>in the category of essence, all the rest, if predicated at all, will be 
<A NAME="149"></A>predicated in the category of essence, should be secured by induction. 
<A NAME="150"></A>Supposing, however, that it be disputed whether what has been rendered 
<A NAME="151"></A>as genus belongs at all, it is not enough to show that one of the higher 
<A NAME="152"></A>genera is predicated of the species in the category of essence: e.g. if 
<A NAME="153"></A>any one has rendered 'locomotion' as the genus of walking, it is not enough 
<A NAME="154"></A>to show that walking is 'motion' in order to show that it is 'locomotion', 
<A NAME="155"></A>seeing that there are other forms of motion as well; but one must show 
<A NAME="156"></A>in addition that walking does not partake of any of the species of motion 
<A NAME="157"></A>produced by the same division except locomotion. For of necessity what 
<A NAME="158"></A>partakes of the genus partakes also of one of the species produced by the 
<A NAME="159"></A>first division of the genus. If, therefore, walking does not partake either 
<A NAME="160"></A>of increase or decrease or of the other kinds of motion, clearly it would 
<A NAME="161"></A>partake of locomotion, so that locomotion would be the genus of 
<A NAME="162"></A>walking.
<A NAME="163"></A><BR><BR>Again, look among the things of which the given species is predicated 
<A NAME="164"></A>as genus, and see if what is rendered as its genus be also predicated in 
<A NAME="165"></A>the category of essence of the very things of which the species is so predicated, 
<A NAME="166"></A>and likewise if all the genera higher than this genus are so predicated 
<A NAME="167"></A>as well. For if there be anywhere a discrepancy, clearly what has been 
<A NAME="168"></A>rendered is not the true genus: for had it been the genus, then both the 
<A NAME="169"></A>genera higher than it, and it itself, would all have been predicated in 
<A NAME="170"></A>the category of essence of those objects of which the species too is predicated 
<A NAME="171"></A>in the category of essence. If, then, you are overthrowing a view, it is 
<A NAME="172"></A>useful to see whether the genus fails to be predicated in the category 
<A NAME="173"></A>of essence of those things of which the species too is predicated. If establishing 
<A NAME="174"></A>a view, it is useful to see whether it is predicated in the category of 
<A NAME="175"></A>essence: for if so, the result will be that the genus and the species will 
<A NAME="176"></A>be predicated of the same object in the category of essence, so that the 
<A NAME="177"></A>same object falls under two genera: the genera must therefore of necessity 
<A NAME="178"></A>be subordinate one to the other, and therefore if it be shown that the 
<A NAME="179"></A>one we wish to establish as genus is not subordinate to the species, clearly 
<A NAME="180"></A>the species would be subordinate to it, so that you may take it as shown 
<A NAME="181"></A>that it is the genus.
<A NAME="182"></A><BR><BR>Look, also, at the definitions of the genera, and see whether they 
<A NAME="183"></A>apply both to the given species and to the objects which partake of the 
<A NAME="184"></A>species. For of necessity the definitions of its genera must be predicated 
<A NAME="185"></A>of the species and of the objects which partake of the species: if, then, 
<A NAME="186"></A>there be anywhere a discrepancy, clearly what has been rendered is not 
<A NAME="187"></A>the genus.
<A NAME="188"></A><BR><BR>Again, see if he has rendered the differentia as the genus, e.g. 
<A NAME="189"></A>'immortal' as the genus of 'God'. For 'immortal' is a differentia of 'living 
<A NAME="190"></A>being', seeing that of living beings some are mortal and others immortal. 
<A NAME="191"></A>Clearly, then, a bad mistake has been made; for the differentia of a thing 
<A NAME="192"></A>is never its genus. And that this is true is clear: for a thing's differentia 
<A NAME="193"></A>never signifies its essence, but rather some quality, as do 'walking' and 
<A NAME="194"></A>'biped'.
<A NAME="195"></A><BR><BR>Also, see whether he has placed the differentia inside the genus, 
<A NAME="196"></A>e.g. by taking 'odd' as a number'. For 'odd' is a differentia of number, 
<A NAME="197"></A>not a species. Nor is the differentia generally thought to partake of the 
<A NAME="198"></A>genus: for what partakes of the genus is always either a species or an 
<A NAME="199"></A>individual, whereas the differentia is neither a species nor an individual. 
<A NAME="200"></A>Clearly, therefore, the differentia does not partake of the genus, so that 
<A NAME="201"></A>'odd' too is no species but a differentia, seeing that it does not partake 
<A NAME="202"></A>of the genus.
<A NAME="203"></A><BR><BR>Moreover, see whether he has placed the genus inside the species, 
<A NAME="204"></A>e.g. by taking 'contact' to be a 'juncture', or 'mixture' a 'fusion', or, 
<A NAME="205"></A>as in Plato's definition,' 'locomotion' to be the same as 'carriage'. For 
<A NAME="206"></A>there is no necessity that contact should be juncture: rather, conversely, 
<A NAME="207"></A>juncture must be contact: for what is in contact is not always joined, 
<A NAME="208"></A>though what is joined is always in contact. Likewise, also, in the remaining 
<A NAME="209"></A>instances: for mixture is not always a 'fusion' (for to mix dry things 
<A NAME="210"></A>does not fuse them), nor is locomotion always 'carriage'. For walking is 
<A NAME="211"></A>not generally thought to be carriage: for 'carriage' is mostly used of 
<A NAME="212"></A>things that change one place for another involuntarily, as happens in the 
<A NAME="213"></A>case of inanimate things. Clearly, also, the species, in the instances 
<A NAME="214"></A>given, has a wider denotation than the genus, whereas it ought to be vice 
<A NAME="215"></A>versa. Again, see whether he has placed the differentia inside the species, 
<A NAME="216"></A>by taking (e.g.) 'immortal' to be 'a god'. For the result will be that 
<A NAME="217"></A>the species has an equal or wider denotation: and this cannot be, for always 
<A NAME="218"></A>the differentia has an equal or a wider denotation than the species. Moreover, 
<A NAME="219"></A>see whether he has placed the genus inside the differentia, by making 'colour' 
<A NAME="220"></A>(e.g.) to be a thing that 'pierces', or 'number' a thing that is 'odd'. 
<A NAME="221"></A>Also, see if he has mentioned the genus as differentia: for it is possible 
<A NAME="222"></A>for a man to bring forward a statement of this kind as well, e.g. that 
<A NAME="223"></A>'mixture' is the differentia of 'fusion', or that change of place' is the 
<A NAME="224"></A>differentia of 'carriage'. All such cases should be examined by means of 
<A NAME="225"></A>the same principles: for they depend upon common rules: for the genus should 
<A NAME="226"></A>have a wider denotation that its differentia, and also should not partake 
<A NAME="227"></A>of its differentia; whereas, if it be rendered in this manner, neither 
<A NAME="228"></A>of the aforesaid requirements can be satisfied: for the genus will both 
<A NAME="229"></A>have a narrower denotation than its differentia, and will partake of 
<A NAME="230"></A>it.
<A NAME="231"></A><BR><BR>Again, if no differentia belonging to the genus be predicated of 
<A NAME="232"></A>the given species, neither will the genus be predicated of it; e.g. of 
<A NAME="233"></A>'soul' neither 'odd' nor 'even' is predicated: neither therefore is 'number'. 
<A NAME="234"></A>Moreover, see whether the species is naturally prior and abolishes the 
<A NAME="235"></A>genus along with itself: for the contrary is the general view. Moreover, 
<A NAME="236"></A>if it be possible for the genus stated, or for its differentia, to be absent 
<A NAME="237"></A>from the alleged species, e.g. for 'movement' to be absent from the 'soul', 
<A NAME="238"></A>or 'truth and falsehood' from 'opinion', then neither of the terms stated 
<A NAME="239"></A>could be its genus or its differentia: for the general view is that the 
<A NAME="240"></A>genus and the differentia accompany the species, as long as it 
<A NAME="241"></A>exists.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="242"></A><B>Part 3</B>

<A NAME="243"></A><BR><BR>Look and see, also, if what is placed in the genus partakes or 
<A NAME="244"></A>could possibly partake of any contrary of the genus: for in that case the 
<A NAME="245"></A>same thing will at the same time partake of contrary things, seeing that 
<A NAME="246"></A>the genus is never absent from it, while it partakes, or can possibly partake, 
<A NAME="247"></A>of the contrary genus as well. Moreover, see whether the species shares 
<A NAME="248"></A>in any character which it is utterly impossible for any member of the genus 
<A NAME="249"></A>to have. Thus (e.g.) if the soul has a share in life, while it is impossible 
<A NAME="250"></A>for any number to live, then the soul could not be a species of 
<A NAME="251"></A>number.
<A NAME="252"></A><BR><BR>You should look and see, also, if the species be a homonym of the 
<A NAME="253"></A>genus, and employ as your elementary principles those already stated for 
<A NAME="254"></A>dealing with homonymity: for the genus and the species are 
<A NAME="255"></A>synonymous.
<A NAME="256"></A><BR><BR>Seeing that of every genus there is more than one species, look 
<A NAME="257"></A>and see if it be impossible that there should be another species than the 
<A NAME="258"></A>given one belonging to the genus stated: for if there should be none, then 
<A NAME="259"></A>clearly what has been stated could not be a genus at 
<A NAME="260"></A>all.
<A NAME="261"></A><BR><BR>Look and see, also, if he has rendered as genus a metaphorical 
<A NAME="262"></A>expression, describing (e.g. 'temperance' as a 'harmony': a 'harmony': 
<A NAME="263"></A>for a genus is always predicated of its species in its literal sense, whereas 
<A NAME="264"></A>'harmony' is predicated of temperance not in a literal sense but metaphorically: 
<A NAME="265"></A>for a harmony always consists in notes.
<A NAME="266"></A><BR><BR>Moreover, if there be any contrary of the species, examine it. 
<A NAME="267"></A>The examination may take different forms; first of all see if the contrary 
<A NAME="268"></A>as well be found in the same genus as the species, supposing the genus 
<A NAME="269"></A>to have no contrary; for contraries ought to be found in the same genus, 
<A NAME="270"></A>if there be no contrary to the genus. Supposing, on the other hand, that 
<A NAME="271"></A>there is a contrary to the genus, see if the contrary of the species be 
<A NAME="272"></A>found in the contrary genus: for of necessity the contrary species must 
<A NAME="273"></A>be in the contrary genus, if there be any contrary to the genus. Each of 
<A NAME="274"></A>these points is made plain by means of induction. Again, see whether the 
<A NAME="275"></A>contrary of the species be not found in any genus at all, but be itself 
<A NAME="276"></A>a genus, e.g. 'good': for if this be not found in any genus, neither will 
<A NAME="277"></A>its contrary be found in any genus, but will itself be a genus, as happens 
<A NAME="278"></A>in the case of 'good' and 'evil': for neither of these is found in a genus, 
<A NAME="279"></A>but each of them is a genus. Moreover, see if both genus and species be 
<A NAME="280"></A>contrary to something, and one pair of contraries have an intermediary, 
<A NAME="281"></A>but not the other. For if the genera have an intermediary, so should their 
<A NAME="282"></A>species as well, and if the species have, so should their genera as well, 
<A NAME="283"></A>as is the case with (1) virtue and vice and (2) justice and injustice: 
<A NAME="284"></A>for each pair has an intermediary. An objection to this is that there is 
<A NAME="285"></A>no intermediary between health and disease, although there is one between 
<A NAME="286"></A>evil and good. Or see whether, though there be indeed an intermediary between 
<A NAME="287"></A>both pairs, i.e. both between the species and between the genera, yet it 
<A NAME="288"></A>be not similarly related, but in one case be a mere negation of the extremes, 
<A NAME="289"></A>whereas in the other case it is a subject. For the general view is that 
<A NAME="290"></A>the relation should be similar in both cases, as it is in the cases of 
<A NAME="291"></A>virtue and vice and of justice and injustice: for the intermediaries between 
<A NAME="292"></A>both are mere negations. Moreover, whenever the genus has no contrary, 
<A NAME="293"></A>look and see not merely whether the contrary of the species be found in 
<A NAME="294"></A>the same genus, but the intermediate as well: for the genus containing 
<A NAME="295"></A>the extremes contains the intermediates as well, as (e.g.) in the case 
<A NAME="296"></A>of white and black: for 'colour' is the genus both of these and of all 
<A NAME="297"></A>the intermediate colours as well. An objection may be raised that 'defect' 
<A NAME="298"></A>and 'excess' are found in the same genus (for both are in the genus 'evil'), 
<A NAME="299"></A>whereas moderate amount', the intermediate between them, is found not in 
<A NAME="300"></A>'evil' but in 'good'. Look and see also whether, while the genus has a 
<A NAME="301"></A>contrary, the species has none; for if the genus be contrary to anything, 
<A NAME="302"></A>so too is the species, as virtue to vice and justice to 
<A NAME="303"></A>injustice.
<A NAME="304"></A><BR><BR><B>Likewise.</B> also, if one were to look at other instances, 
<A NAME="305"></A>one would come to see clearly a fact like this. An objection may be raised 
<A NAME="306"></A>in the case of health and disease: for health in general is the contrary 
<A NAME="307"></A>of disease, whereas a particular disease, being a species of disease, e.g. 
<A NAME="308"></A>fever and ophthalmia and any other particular disease, has no 
<A NAME="309"></A>contrary.
<A NAME="310"></A><BR><BR>If, therefore, you are demolishing a view, there are all these 
<A NAME="311"></A>ways in which you should make your examination: for if the aforesaid characters 
<A NAME="312"></A>do not belong to it, clearly what has been rendered is not the genus. If, 
<A NAME="313"></A>on the other hand, you are establishing a view, there are three ways: in 
<A NAME="314"></A>the first place, see whether the contrary of the species be found in the 
<A NAME="315"></A>genus stated, suppose the genus have no contrary: for if the contrary be 
<A NAME="316"></A>found in it, clearly the species in question is found in it as well. Moreover, 
<A NAME="317"></A>see if the intermediate species is found in the genus stated: for whatever 
<A NAME="318"></A>genus contains the intermediate contains the extremes as well. Again, if 
<A NAME="319"></A>the genus have a contrary, look and see whether also the contrary species 
<A NAME="320"></A>is found in the contrary genus: for if so, clearly also the species in 
<A NAME="321"></A>question is found in the genus in question.
<A NAME="322"></A><BR><BR>Again, consider in the case of the inflexions and the co-ordinates 
<A NAME="323"></A>of species and genus, and see whether they follow likewise, both in demolishing 
<A NAME="324"></A>and in establishing a view. For whatever attribute belongs or does not 
<A NAME="325"></A>belong to one belongs or does not belong at the same time to all; e.g. 
<A NAME="326"></A>if justice be a particular form of knowledge, then also 'justly' is 'knowingly' 
<A NAME="327"></A>and the just man is a man of knowledge: whereas if any of these things 
<A NAME="328"></A>be not so, then neither is any of the rest of them.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="329"></A><B>Part 4</B>

<A NAME="330"></A><BR><BR>Again, consider the case of things that bear a like relation to 
<A NAME="331"></A>one another. Thus (e.g.) the relation of the pleasant to pleasure is like 
<A NAME="332"></A>that of the useful to the good: for in each case the one produces the other. 
<A NAME="333"></A>If therefore pleasure be a kind of 'good', then also the pleasant will 
<A NAME="334"></A>be a kind of 'useful': for clearly it may be taken to be productive of 
<A NAME="335"></A>good, seeing that pleasure is good. In the same way also consider the case 
<A NAME="336"></A>of processes of generation and destruction; if (e.g.) to build be to be 
<A NAME="337"></A>active, then to have built is to have been active, and if to learn be to 
<A NAME="338"></A>recollect, then also to have learnt is to have recollected, and if to be 
<A NAME="339"></A>decomposed be to be destroyed, then to have been decomposed is to have 
<A NAME="340"></A>been destroyed, and decomposition is a kind of destruction. Consider also 
<A NAME="341"></A>in the same way the case of things that generate or destroy, and of the 
<A NAME="342"></A>capacities and uses of things; and in general, both in demolishing and 
<A NAME="343"></A>in establishing an argument, you should examine things in the light of 
<A NAME="344"></A>any resemblance of whatever description, as we were saying in the case 
<A NAME="345"></A>of generation and destruction. For if what tends to destroy tends to decompose, 
<A NAME="346"></A>then also to be destroyed is to be decomposed: and if what tends to generate 
<A NAME="347"></A>tends to produce, then to be generated is to be produced, and generation 
<A NAME="348"></A>is production. Likewise, also, in the case of the capacities and uses of 
<A NAME="349"></A>things: for if a capacity be a disposition, then also to be capable of 
<A NAME="350"></A>something is to be disposed to it, and if the use of anything be an activity, 
<A NAME="351"></A>then to use it is to be active, and to have used it is to have been 
<A NAME="352"></A>active.
<A NAME="353"></A><BR><BR>If the opposite of the species be a privation, there are two ways 
<A NAME="354"></A>of demolishing an argument, first of all by looking to see if the opposite 
<A NAME="355"></A>be found in the genus rendered: for either the privation is to be found 
<A NAME="356"></A>absolutely nowhere in the same genus, or at least not in the same ultimate 
<A NAME="357"></A>genus: e.g. if the ultimate genus containing sight be sensation, then blindness 
<A NAME="358"></A>will not be a sensation. Secondly, if there be a sensation. Secondly, if 
<A NAME="359"></A>there be a privation opposed to both genus and species, but the opposite 
<A NAME="360"></A>of the species be not found in the opposite of the genus, then neither 
<A NAME="361"></A>could the species rendered be in the genus rendered. If, then, you are 
<A NAME="362"></A>demolishing a view, you should follow the rule as stated; but if establishing 
<A NAME="363"></A>one there is but one way: for if the opposite species be found in the opposite 
<A NAME="364"></A>genus, then also the species in question would be found in the genus in 
<A NAME="365"></A>question: e.g. if 'blindness' be a form of 'insensibility', then 'sight' 
<A NAME="366"></A>is a form of 'sensation'.
<A NAME="367"></A><BR><BR>Again, look at the negations of the genus and species and convert 
<A NAME="368"></A>the order of terms, according to the method described in the case of Accident: 
<A NAME="369"></A>e.g. if the pleasant be a kind of good, what is not good is not pleasant. 
<A NAME="370"></A>For were this no something not good as well would then be pleasant. That, 
<A NAME="371"></A>however, cannot be, for it is impossible, if 'good' be the genus of pleasant, 
<A NAME="372"></A>that anything not good should be pleasant: for of things of which the genus 
<A NAME="373"></A>is not predicated, none of the species is predicated either. Also, in establishing 
<A NAME="374"></A>a view, you should adopt the same method of examination: for if what is 
<A NAME="375"></A>not good be not pleasant, then what is pleasant is good, so that 'good' 
<A NAME="376"></A>is the genus of 'pleasant'.
<A NAME="377"></A><BR><BR>If the species be a relative term, see whether the genus be a relative 
<A NAME="378"></A>term as well: for if the species be a relative term, so too is the genus, 
<A NAME="379"></A>as is the case with 'double' and 'multiple': for each is a relative term. 
<A NAME="380"></A>If, on the other hand, the genus be a relative term, there is no necessity 
<A NAME="381"></A>that the species should be so as well: for 'knowledge'is a relative term, 
<A NAME="382"></A>but not so 'grammar'. Or possibly not even the first statement would be 
<A NAME="383"></A>generally considered true: for virtue is a kind of 'noble' and a kind of 
<A NAME="384"></A>'good' thing, and yet, while 'virtue' is a relative term, 'good' and 'noble' 
<A NAME="385"></A>are not relatives but qualities. Again, see whether the species fails to 
<A NAME="386"></A>be used in the same relation when called by its own name, and when called 
<A NAME="387"></A>by the name of its genus: e.g. if the term 'double' be used to mean the 
<A NAME="388"></A>double of a 'half', then also the term 'multiple' ought to be used to mean 
<A NAME="389"></A>multiple of a 'half'. Otherwise 'multiple' could not be the genus of 
<A NAME="390"></A>'double'.
<A NAME="391"></A><BR><BR>Moreover, see whether the term fail to be used in the same relation 
<A NAME="392"></A>both when called by the name of its genus, and also when called by those 
<A NAME="393"></A>of all the genera of its genus. For if the double be a multiple of a half, 
<A NAME="394"></A>then 'in excess of 'will also be used in relation to a 'half': and, in 
<A NAME="395"></A>general, the double will be called by the names of all the higher genera 
<A NAME="396"></A>in relation to a 'half'. An objection may be raised that there is no necessity 
<A NAME="397"></A>for a term to be used in the same relation when called by its own name 
<A NAME="398"></A>and when called by that of its genus: for 'knowledge' is called knowledge 
<A NAME="399"></A>'of an object', whereas it is called a 'state' and 'disposition' not of 
<A NAME="400"></A>an 'object' but of the 'soul'.
<A NAME="401"></A><BR><BR>Again, see whether the genus and the species be used in the same 
<A NAME="402"></A>way in respect of the inflexions they take, e.g. datives and genitives 
<A NAME="403"></A>and all the rest. For as the species is used, so should the genus be as 
<A NAME="404"></A>well, as in the case of 'double' and its higher genera: for we say both 
<A NAME="405"></A>'double of' and 'multiple of' a thing. Likewise, also, in the case of 'knowledge': 
<A NAME="406"></A>for both knowledge' itself and its genera, e.g. 'disposition' and 'state', 
<A NAME="407"></A>are said to be 'of' something. An objection may be raised that in some 
<A NAME="408"></A>cases it is not so: for we say 'superior to' and 'contrary to' so and so, 
<A NAME="409"></A>whereas 'other', which is the genus of these terms, demands not 'to' but 
<A NAME="410"></A>'than': for the expression is 'other than' so and so.
<A NAME="411"></A><BR><BR>Again, see whether terms used in like case relationships fail to 
<A NAME="412"></A>yield a like construction when converted, as do 'double' and 'multiple'. 
<A NAME="413"></A>For each of these terms takes a genitive both in itself and in its converted 
<A NAME="414"></A>form: for we say both a half of' and 'a fraction of' something. The case 
<A NAME="415"></A>is the same also as regards both 'knowledge' and 'conception': for these 
<A NAME="416"></A>take a genitive, and by conversion an 'object of knowledge' and an 'object 
<A NAME="417"></A>of conception' are both alike used with a dative. If, then, in any cases 
<A NAME="418"></A>the constructions after conversion be not alike, clearly the one term is 
<A NAME="419"></A>not the genus of the other.
<A NAME="420"></A><BR><BR>Again, see whether the species and the genus fail to be used in 
<A NAME="421"></A>relation to an equal number of things: for the general view is that the 
<A NAME="422"></A>uses of both are alike and equal in number, as is the case with 'present' 
<A NAME="423"></A>and 'grant'. For a present' is of something or to some one, and also a 
<A NAME="424"></A>'grant' is of something and to some one: and 'grant' is the genus of 'present', 
<A NAME="425"></A>for a 'present' is a 'grant that need not be returned'. In some cases, 
<A NAME="426"></A>however, the number of relations in which the terms are used happens not 
<A NAME="427"></A>to be equal, for while 'double' is double of something, we speak of 'in 
<A NAME="428"></A>excess' or 'greater' in something, as well as of or than something: for 
<A NAME="429"></A>what is in excess or greater is always in excess in something, as well 
<A NAME="430"></A>as in excess of something. Hence the terms in question are not the genera 
<A NAME="431"></A>of 'double', inasmuch as they are not used in relation to an equal number 
<A NAME="432"></A>of things with the species. Or possibly it is not universally true that 
<A NAME="433"></A>species and genus are used in relation to an equal number of 
<A NAME="434"></A>things.
<A NAME="435"></A><BR><BR>See, also, if the opposite of the species have the opposite of 
<A NAME="436"></A>the genus as its genus, e.g. whether, if 'multiple' be the genus of 'double', 
<A NAME="437"></A>'fraction' be also the genus of 'half'. For the opposite of the genus should 
<A NAME="438"></A>always be the genus of the opposite species. If, then, any one were to 
<A NAME="439"></A>assert that knowledge is a kind of sensation, then also the object of knowledge 
<A NAME="440"></A>will have to be a kind of object of sensation, whereas it is not: for an 
<A NAME="441"></A>object of knowledge is not always an object of sensation: for objects of 
<A NAME="442"></A>knowledge include some of the objects of intuition as well. Hence 'object 
<A NAME="443"></A>of sensation' is not the genus of 'object of knowledge': and if this be 
<A NAME="444"></A>so, neither is 'sensation' the genus of 'knowledge'.
<A NAME="445"></A><BR><BR>Seeing that of relative terms some are of necessity found in, or 
<A NAME="446"></A>used of, the things in relation to which they happen at any time to be 
<A NAME="447"></A>used (e.g. 'disposition' and 'state' and 'balance'; for in nothing else 
<A NAME="448"></A>can the aforesaid terms possibly be found except in the things in relation 
<A NAME="449"></A>to which they are used), while others need not be found in the things in 
<A NAME="450"></A>relation to which they are used at any time, though they still may be (e.g. 
<A NAME="451"></A>if the term 'object of knowledge' be applied to the soul: for it is quite 
<A NAME="452"></A>possible that the knowledge of itself should be possessed by the soul itself, 
<A NAME="453"></A>but it is not necessary, for it is possible for this same knowledge to 
<A NAME="454"></A>be found in some one else), while for others, again, it is absolutely impossible 
<A NAME="455"></A>that they should be found in the things in relation to which they happen 
<A NAME="456"></A>at any time to be used (as e.g. that the contrary should be found in the 
<A NAME="457"></A>contrary or knowledge in the object of knowledge, unless the object of 
<A NAME="458"></A>knowledge happen to be a soul or a man)-you should look, therefore, and 
<A NAME="459"></A>see whether he places a term of one kind inside a genus that is not of 
<A NAME="460"></A>that kind, e.g. suppose he has said that 'memory' is the 'abiding of knowledge'. 
<A NAME="461"></A>For 'abiding' is always found in that which abides, and is used of that, 
<A NAME="462"></A>so that the abiding of knowledge also will be found in knowledge. Memory, 
<A NAME="463"></A>then, is found in knowledge, seeing that it is the abiding of knowledge. 
<A NAME="464"></A>But this is impossible, for memory is always found in the soul. The aforesaid 
<A NAME="465"></A>commonplace rule is common to the subject of Accident as well: for it is 
<A NAME="466"></A>all the same to say that 'abiding' is the genus of memory, or to allege 
<A NAME="467"></A>that it is an accident of it. For if in any way whatever memory be the 
<A NAME="468"></A>abiding of knowledge, the same argument in regard to it will 
<A NAME="469"></A>apply.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="470"></A><B>Part 5</B>

<A NAME="471"></A><BR><BR>Again, see if he has placed what is a 'state' inside the genus 
<A NAME="472"></A>'activity', or an activity inside the genus 'state', e.g. by defining 'sensation' 
<A NAME="473"></A>as 'movement communicated through the body': for sensation is a 'state', 
<A NAME="474"></A>whereas movement is an 'activity'. Likewise, also, if he has said that 
<A NAME="475"></A>memory is a 'state that is retentive of a conception', for memory is never 
<A NAME="476"></A>a state, but rather an activity.
<A NAME="477"></A><BR><BR>They also make a bad mistake who rank a 'state' within the 'capacity' 
<A NAME="478"></A>that attends it, e.g. by defining 'good temper' as the 'control of anger', 
<A NAME="479"></A>and 'courage' and 'justice' as 'control of fears' and of 'gains': for the 
<A NAME="480"></A>terms 'courageous' and 'good-tempered' are applied to a man who is immune 
<A NAME="481"></A>from passion, whereas 'self-controlled' describes the man who is exposed 
<A NAME="482"></A>to passion and not led by it. Quite possibly, indeed, each of the former 
<A NAME="483"></A>is attended by a capacity such that, if he were exposed to passion, he 
<A NAME="484"></A>would control it and not be led by it: but, for all that, this is not what 
<A NAME="485"></A>is meant by being 'courageous' in the one case, and 'good tempered' in 
<A NAME="486"></A>the other; what is meant is an absolute immunity from any passions of that 
<A NAME="487"></A>kind at all.
<A NAME="488"></A><BR><BR>Sometimes, also, people state any kind of attendant feature as 
<A NAME="489"></A>the genus, e.g. 'pain' as the genus of 'anger' and 'conception' as that 
<A NAME="490"></A>of conviction'. For both of the things in question follow in a certain 
<A NAME="491"></A>sense upon the given species, but neither of them is genus to it. For when 
<A NAME="492"></A>the angry man feels pain, the pain bas appeared in him earlier than the 
<A NAME="493"></A>anger: for his anger is not the cause of his pain, but his pain of his 
<A NAME="494"></A>anger, so that anger emphatically is not pain. By the same reasoning, neither 
<A NAME="495"></A>is conviction conception: for it is possible to have the same conception 
<A NAME="496"></A>even without being convinced of it, whereas this is impossible if conviction 
<A NAME="497"></A>be a species of conception: for it is impossible for a thing still to remain 
<A NAME="498"></A>the same if it be entirely transferred out of its species, just as neither 
<A NAME="499"></A>could the same animal at one time be, and at another not be, a man. If, 
<A NAME="500"></A>on the other hand, any one says that a man who has a conception must of 
<A NAME="501"></A>necessity be also convinced of it, then 'conception' and 'conviction' will 
<A NAME="502"></A>be used with an equal denotation, so that not even so could the former 
<A NAME="503"></A>be the genus of the latter: for the denotation of the genus should be 
<A NAME="504"></A>wider.
<A NAME="505"></A><BR><BR>See, also, whether both naturally come to be anywhere in the same 
<A NAME="506"></A>thing: for what contains the species contains the genus as well: e.g. what 
<A NAME="507"></A>contains 'white' contains 'colour' as well, and what contains 'knowledge 
<A NAME="508"></A>of grammar' contains 'knowledge' as well. If, therefore, any one says that 
<A NAME="509"></A>'shame' is 'fear', or that 'anger' is 'pain', the result will be that genus 
<A NAME="510"></A>and species are not found in the same thing: for shame is found in the 
<A NAME="511"></A>'reasoning' faculty, whereas fear is in the 'spirited' faculty, and 'pain' 
<A NAME="512"></A>is found in the faculty of 'desires'. (for in this pleasure also is found), 
<A NAME="513"></A>whereas 'anger' is found in the 'spirited' faculty. Hence the terms rendered 
<A NAME="514"></A>are not the genera, seeing that they do not naturally come to be in the 
<A NAME="515"></A>same faculty as the species. Likewise, also, if 'friendship' be found in 
<A NAME="516"></A>the faculty of desires, you may take it that it is not a form of 'wishing': 
<A NAME="517"></A>for wishing is always found in the 'reasoning' faculty. This commonplace 
<A NAME="518"></A>rule is useful also in dealing with Accident: for the accident and that 
<A NAME="519"></A>of which it is an accident are both found in the same thing, so that if 
<A NAME="520"></A>they do not appear in the same thing, clearly it is not an 
<A NAME="521"></A>accident.
<A NAME="522"></A><BR><BR>Again, see if the species partakes of the genus attributed only 
<A NAME="523"></A>in some particular respect: for it is the general view that the genus is 
<A NAME="524"></A>not thus imparted only in some particular respect: for a man is not an 
<A NAME="525"></A>animal in a particular respect, nor is grammar knowledge in a particular 
<A NAME="526"></A>respect only. Likewise also in other instances. Look, therefore, and see 
<A NAME="527"></A>if in the case of any of its species the genus be imparted only in a certain 
<A NAME="528"></A>respect; e.g. if 'animal' has been described as an 'object of perception' 
<A NAME="529"></A>or of 'sight'. For an animal is an object of perception or of sight in 
<A NAME="530"></A>a particular respect only; for it is in respect of its body that it is 
<A NAME="531"></A>perceived and seen, not in respect of its soul, so that-'object of sight' 
<A NAME="532"></A>and 'object of perception' could not be the genus of 
<A NAME="533"></A>'animal'.
<A NAME="534"></A><BR><BR>Sometimes also people place the whole inside the part without detection, 
<A NAME="535"></A>defining (e.g.) 'animal' as an 'animate body'; whereas the part is not 
<A NAME="536"></A>predicated in any sense of the whole, so that 'body' could not be the genus 
<A NAME="537"></A>of animal, seeing that it is a part.
<A NAME="538"></A><BR><BR>See also if he has put anything that is blameworthy or objectionable 
<A NAME="539"></A>into the class 'capacity' or 'capable', e.g. by defining a 'sophist' or 
<A NAME="540"></A>a 'slanderer', or a 'thief' as 'one who is capable of secretly thieving 
<A NAME="541"></A>other people's property'. For none of the aforesaid characters is so called 
<A NAME="542"></A>because he is 'capable' in one of these respects: for even God and the 
<A NAME="543"></A>good man are capable of doing bad things, but that is not their character: 
<A NAME="544"></A>for it is always in respect of their choice that bad men are so called. 
<A NAME="545"></A>Moreover, a capacity is always a desirable thing: for even the capacities 
<A NAME="546"></A>for doing bad things are desirable, and therefore it is we say that even 
<A NAME="547"></A>God and the good man possess them; for they are capable (we say) of doing 
<A NAME="548"></A>evil. So then 'capacity' can never be the genus of anything blameworthy. 
<A NAME="549"></A>Else, the result will be that what is blameworthy is sometimes desirable: 
<A NAME="550"></A>for there will be a certain form of capacity that is 
<A NAME="551"></A>blameworthy.
<A NAME="552"></A><BR><BR>Also, see if he has put anything that is precious or desirable 
<A NAME="553"></A>for its own sake into the class 'capacity' or 'capable' or 'productive' 
<A NAME="554"></A>of anything. For capacity, and what is capable or productive of anything, 
<A NAME="555"></A>is always desirable for the sake of something else.
<A NAME="556"></A><BR><BR>Or see if he has put anything that exists in two genera or more 
<A NAME="557"></A>into one of them only. For some things it is impossible to place in a single 
<A NAME="558"></A>genus, e.g. the 'cheat' and the 'slanderer': for neither he who has the 
<A NAME="559"></A>will without the capacity, nor he who has the capacity without the will, 
<A NAME="560"></A>is a slanderer or cheat, but he who has both of them. Hence he must be 
<A NAME="561"></A>put not into one genus, but into both the aforesaid 
<A NAME="562"></A>genera.
<A NAME="563"></A><BR><BR>Moreover, people sometimes in converse order render genus as differentia, 
<A NAME="564"></A>and differentia as genus, defining (e.g.) astonishment as 'excess of wonderment' 
<A NAME="565"></A>and conviction as 'vehemence of conception'. For neither 'excess' nor 'vehemence' 
<A NAME="566"></A>is the genus, but the differentia: for astonishment is usually taken to 
<A NAME="567"></A>be an 'excessive wonderment', and conviction to be a 'vehement conception', 
<A NAME="568"></A>so that 'wonderment' and 'conception' are the genus, while 'excess' and 
<A NAME="569"></A>'vehemence' are the differentia. Moreover, if any one renders 'excess' 
<A NAME="570"></A>and 'vehemence' as genera, then inanimate things will be convinced and 
<A NAME="571"></A>astonished. For 'vehemence' and 'excess' of a thing are found in a thing 
<A NAME="572"></A>which is thus vehement and in excess. If, therefore, astonishment be excess 
<A NAME="573"></A>of wonderment the astonishment will be found in the wonderment, so that 
<A NAME="574"></A>'wonderment' will be astonished! Likewise, also, conviction will be found 
<A NAME="575"></A>in the conception, if it be 'vehemence of conception', so that the conception 
<A NAME="576"></A>will be convinced. Moreover, a man who renders an answer in this style 
<A NAME="577"></A>will in consequence find himself calling vehemence vehement and excess 
<A NAME="578"></A>excessive: for there is such a thing as a vehement conviction: if then 
<A NAME="579"></A>conviction be 'vehemence', there would be a 'vehement vehemence'. Likewise, 
<A NAME="580"></A>also, there is such a thing as excessive astonishment: if then astonishment 
<A NAME="581"></A>be an excess, there would be an 'excessive excess'. Whereas neither of 
<A NAME="582"></A>these things is generally believed, any more than that knowledge is a knower 
<A NAME="583"></A>or motion a moving thing.
<A NAME="584"></A><BR><BR>Sometimes, too, people make the bad mistake of putting an affection 
<A NAME="585"></A>into that which is affected, as its genus, e.g. those who say that immortality 
<A NAME="586"></A>is everlasting life: for immortality seems to be a certain affection or 
<A NAME="587"></A>accidental feature of life. That this saying is true would appear clear 
<A NAME="588"></A>if any one were to admit that a man can pass from being mortal and become 
<A NAME="589"></A>immortal: for no one will assert that he takes another life, but that a 
<A NAME="590"></A>certain accidental feature or affection enters into this one as it is. 
<A NAME="591"></A>So then 'life' is not the genus of immortality.
<A NAME="592"></A><BR><BR>Again, see if to an affection he has ascribed as genus the object 
<A NAME="593"></A>of which it is an affection, by defining (e.g.) wind as 'air in motion'. 
<A NAME="594"></A>Rather, wind is 'a movement of air': for the same air persists both when 
<A NAME="595"></A>it is in motion and when it is still. Hence wind is not 'air' at all: for 
<A NAME="596"></A>then there would also have been wind when the air was not in motion, seeing 
<A NAME="597"></A>that the same air which formed the wind persists. Likewise, also, in other 
<A NAME="598"></A>cases of the kind. Even, then, if we ought in this instance to admit the 
<A NAME="599"></A>point that wind is 'air in motion', yet we should accept a definition of 
<A NAME="600"></A>the kind, not about all those things of which the genus is not true, but 
<A NAME="601"></A>only in cases where the genus rendered is a true predicate. For in some 
<A NAME="602"></A>cases, e.g. 'mud' or 'snow', it is not generally held to be true. For people 
<A NAME="603"></A>tell you that snow is 'frozen water' and mud is earth mixed with moisture', 
<A NAME="604"></A>whereas snow is not water, nor mud earth, so that neither of the terms 
<A NAME="605"></A>rendered could be the genus: for the genus should be true of all its species. 
<A NAME="606"></A>Likewise neither is wine 'fermented water', as Empedocles speaks of 'water 
<A NAME="607"></A>fermented in wood';' for it simply is not water at all.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="608"></A><B>Part 6</B>

<A NAME="609"></A><BR><BR>Moreover, see whether the term rendered fail to be the genus of 
<A NAME="610"></A>anything at all; for then clearly it also fails to be the genus of the 
<A NAME="611"></A>species mentioned. Examine the point by seeing whether the objects that 
<A NAME="612"></A>partake of the genus fail to be specifically different from one another, 
<A NAME="613"></A>e.g. white objects: for these do not differ specifically from one another, 
<A NAME="614"></A>whereas of a genus the species are always different, so that 'white' could 
<A NAME="615"></A>not be the genus of anything.
<A NAME="616"></A><BR><BR>Again, see whether he has named as genus or differentia some feature 
<A NAME="617"></A>that goes with everything: for the number of attributes that follow everything 
<A NAME="618"></A>is comparatively large: thus (e.g.) 'Being' and 'Unity' are among the number 
<A NAME="619"></A>of attributes that follow everything. If, therefore, he has rendered 'Being' 
<A NAME="620"></A>as a genus, clearly it would be the genus of everything, seeing that it 
<A NAME="621"></A>is predicated of everything; for the genus is never predicated of anything 
<A NAME="622"></A>except of its species. Hence Unity, inter alia, will be a species of Being. 
<A NAME="623"></A>The result, therefore, is that of all things of which the genus is predicated, 
<A NAME="624"></A>the species is predicated as well, seeing that Being and Unity are predicates 
<A NAME="625"></A>of absolutely everything, whereas the predication of the species ought 
<A NAME="626"></A>to be of narrower range. If, on the other hand, he has named as differentia 
<A NAME="627"></A>some attribute that follows everything, clearly the denotation of the differentia 
<A NAME="628"></A>will be equal to, or wider than, that of the genus. For if the genus, too, 
<A NAME="629"></A>be some attribute that follows everything, the denotation of the differentia 
<A NAME="630"></A>will be equal to its denotation, while if the genus do not follow everything, 
<A NAME="631"></A>it will be still wider.
<A NAME="632"></A><BR><BR>Moreover, see if the description 'inherent in S' be used of the 
<A NAME="633"></A>genus rendered in relation to its species, as it is used of 'white' in 
<A NAME="634"></A>the case of snow, thus showing clearly that it could not be the genus: 
<A NAME="635"></A>for 'true of S' is the only description used of the genus in relation to 
<A NAME="636"></A>its species. Look and see also if the genus fails to be synonymous with 
<A NAME="637"></A>its species. For the genus is always predicated of its species 
<A NAME="638"></A>synonymously.
<A NAME="639"></A><BR><BR>Moreover, beware, whenever both species and genus have a contrary, 
<A NAME="640"></A>and he places the better of the contraries inside the worse genus: for 
<A NAME="641"></A>the result will be that the remaining species will be found in the remaining 
<A NAME="642"></A>genus, seeing that contraries are found in contrary genera, so that the 
<A NAME="643"></A>better species will be found in the worse genus and the worse in the better: 
<A NAME="644"></A>whereas the usual view is that of the better species the genus too is better. 
<A NAME="645"></A>Also see if he has placed the species inside the worse and not inside the 
<A NAME="646"></A>better genus, when it is at the same time related in like manner to both, 
<A NAME="647"></A>as (e.g.) if he has defined the 'soul' as a 'form of motion' or 'a form 
<A NAME="648"></A>of moving thing'. For the same soul is usually thought to be a principle 
<A NAME="649"></A>alike of rest and of motion, so that, if rest is the better of the two, 
<A NAME="650"></A>this is the genus into which the soul should have been 
<A NAME="651"></A>put.
<A NAME="652"></A><BR><BR>Moreover, judge by means of greater and less degrees: if overthrowing 
<A NAME="653"></A>a view, see whether the genus admits of a greater degree, whereas neither 
<A NAME="654"></A>the species itself does so, nor any term that is called after it: e.g. 
<A NAME="655"></A>if virtue admits of a greater degree, so too does justice and the just 
<A NAME="656"></A>man: for one man is called 'more just than another'. If, therefore, the 
<A NAME="657"></A>genus rendered admits of a greater degree, whereas neither the species 
<A NAME="658"></A>does so itself nor yet any term called after it, then what has been rendered 
<A NAME="659"></A>could not be the genus.
<A NAME="660"></A><BR><BR>Again, if what is more generally, or as generally, thought to be 
<A NAME="661"></A>the genus be not so, clearly neither is the genus rendered. The commonplace 
<A NAME="662"></A>rule in question is useful especially in cases where the species appears 
<A NAME="663"></A>to have several predicates in the category of essence, and where no distinction 
<A NAME="664"></A>has been drawn between them, and we cannot say which of them is genus; 
<A NAME="665"></A>e.g. both 'pain' and the 'conception of a slight' are usually thought to 
<A NAME="666"></A>be predicates of 'anger in the category of essence: for the angry man is 
<A NAME="667"></A>both in pain and also conceives that he is slighted. The same mode of inquiry 
<A NAME="668"></A>may be applied also to the case of the species, by comparing it with some 
<A NAME="669"></A>other species: for if the one which is more generally, or as generally, 
<A NAME="670"></A>thought to be found in the genus rendered be not found therein, then clearly 
<A NAME="671"></A>neither could the species rendered be found therein.
<A NAME="672"></A><BR><BR>In demolishing a view, therefore, you should follow the rule as 
<A NAME="673"></A>stated. In establishing one, on the other hand, the commonplace rule that 
<A NAME="674"></A>you should see if both the genus rendered and the species admit of a greater 
<A NAME="675"></A>degree will not serve: for even though both admit it, it is still possible 
<A NAME="676"></A>for one not to be the genus of the other. For both 'beautiful' and 'white' 
<A NAME="677"></A>admit of a greater degree, and neither is the genus of the other. On the 
<A NAME="678"></A>other hand, the comparison of the genera and of the species one with another 
<A NAME="679"></A>is of use: e.g. supposing A and B to have a like claim to be genus, then 
<A NAME="680"></A>if one be a genus, so also is the other. Likewise, also, if what has less 
<A NAME="681"></A>claim be a genus, so also is what has more claim: e.g. if 'capacity' have 
<A NAME="682"></A>more claim than 'virtue' to be the genus of self-control, and virtue be 
<A NAME="683"></A>the genus, so also is capacity. The same observations will apply also in 
<A NAME="684"></A>the case of the species. For instance, supposing A and B to have a like 
<A NAME="685"></A>claim to be a species of the genus in question, then if the one be a species, 
<A NAME="686"></A>so also is the other: and if that which is less generally thought to be 
<A NAME="687"></A>so be a species, so also is that which is more generally thought to be 
<A NAME="688"></A>so.
<A NAME="689"></A><BR><BR>Moreover, to establish a view, you should look and see if the genus 
<A NAME="690"></A>is predicated in the category of essence of those things of which it has 
<A NAME="691"></A>been rendered as the genus, supposing the species rendered to be not one 
<A NAME="692"></A>single species but several different ones: for then clearly it will be 
<A NAME="693"></A>the genus. If, on the other, the species rendered be single, look and see 
<A NAME="694"></A>whether the genus be predicated in the category of essence of other species 
<A NAME="695"></A>as well: for then, again, the result will be that it is predicated of several 
<A NAME="696"></A>different species.
<A NAME="697"></A><BR><BR>Since some people think that the differentia, too, is a predicate 
<A NAME="698"></A>of the various species in the category of essence, you should distinguish 
<A NAME="699"></A>the genus from the differentia by employing the aforesaid elementary principles-(a) 
<A NAME="700"></A>that the genus has a wider denotation than the differentia; (b) that in 
<A NAME="701"></A>rendering the essence of a thing it is more fitting to state the genus 
<A NAME="702"></A>than the differentia: for any one who says that 'man' is an 'animal' shows 
<A NAME="703"></A>what man is better than he who describes him as 'walking'; also (c) that 
<A NAME="704"></A>the differentia always signifies a quality of the genus, whereas the genus 
<A NAME="705"></A>does not do this of the differentia: for he who says 'walking' describes 
<A NAME="706"></A>an animal of a certain quality, whereas he who says 'animal' describes 
<A NAME="707"></A>an animal of a certain quality, whereas he who says 'animal' does not describe 
<A NAME="708"></A>a walking thing of a certain quality.
<A NAME="709"></A><BR><BR>The differentia, then, should be distinguished from the genus in 
<A NAME="710"></A>this manner. Now seeing it is generally held that if what is musical, in 
<A NAME="711"></A>being musical, possesses knowledge in some respect, then also 'music' is 
<A NAME="712"></A>a particular kind of 'knowledge'; and also that if what walks is moved 
<A NAME="713"></A>in walking, then 'walking' is a particular kind of 'movement'; you should 
<A NAME="714"></A>therefore examine in the aforesaid manner any genus in which you want to 
<A NAME="715"></A>establish the existence of something; e.g. if you wish to prove that 'knowledge' 
<A NAME="716"></A>is a form of 'conviction', see whether the knower in knowing is convinced: 
<A NAME="717"></A>for then clearly knowledge would be a particular kind of conviction. You 
<A NAME="718"></A>should proceed in the same way also in regard to the other cases of this 
<A NAME="719"></A>kind.
<A NAME="720"></A><BR><BR>Moreover, seeing that it is difficult to distinguish whatever always 
<A NAME="721"></A>follows along with a thing, and is not convertible with it, from its genus, 
<A NAME="722"></A>if A follows B universally, whereas B does not follow A universally-as 
<A NAME="723"></A>e.g. 'rest' always follows a 'calm' and 'divisibility' follows 'number', 
<A NAME="724"></A>but not conversely (for the divisible is not always a number, nor rest 
<A NAME="725"></A>a calm)-you may yourself assume in your treatment of them that the one 
<A NAME="726"></A>which always follows is the genus, whenever the other is not convertible 
<A NAME="727"></A>with it: if, on the other hand, some one else puts forward the proposition, 
<A NAME="728"></A>do not accept it universally. An objection to it is that 'not-being' always 
<A NAME="729"></A>follows what is 'coming to be' (for what is coming to be is not) and is 
<A NAME="730"></A>not convertible with it (for what is not is not always coming to be), and 
<A NAME="731"></A>that still 'not-being' is not the genus of 'coming to be': for 'not-being' 
<A NAME="732"></A>has not any species at all. Questions, then, in regard to Genus should 
<A NAME="733"></A>be investigated in the ways described.
