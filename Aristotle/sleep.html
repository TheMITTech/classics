<BR><BR>
<A NAME="10"></A><B>Part 1</B>

<BR><BR>
<A NAME="11"></A>With regard to sleep and waking, we must consider what they are: whether 
<A NAME="12"></A>they are peculiar to soul or to body, or common to both; and if common, 
<A NAME="13"></A>to what part of soul or body they appertain: further, from what cause it 
<A NAME="14"></A>arises that they are attributes of animals, and whether all animals share 
<A NAME="15"></A>in them both, or some partake of the one only, others of the other only, 
<A NAME="16"></A>or some partake of neither and some of both.
<A NAME="17"></A><BR><BR>Further, in addition to these questions, we must also inquire what 
<A NAME="18"></A>the dream is, and from what cause sleepers sometimes dream, and sometimes 
<A NAME="19"></A>do not; or whether the truth is that sleepers always dream but do not always 
<A NAME="20"></A>remember (their dream); and if this occurs, what its explanation 
<A NAME="21"></A>is.
<A NAME="22"></A><BR><BR>Again, [we must inquire] whether it is possible or not to foresee 
<A NAME="23"></A>the future (in dreams), and if it be possible, in what manner; further, 
<A NAME="24"></A>whether, supposing it possible, it extends only to things to be accomplished 
<A NAME="25"></A>by the agency of Man, or to those also of which the cause lies in supra-human 
<A NAME="26"></A>agency, and which result from the workings of Nature, or of 
<A NAME="27"></A>Spontaneity.
<A NAME="28"></A><BR><BR>First, then, this much is clear, that waking and sleep appertain 
<A NAME="29"></A>to the same part of an animal, inasmuch as they are opposites, and sleep 
<A NAME="30"></A>is evidently a privation of waking. For contraries, in natural as well 
<A NAME="31"></A>as in all other matters, are seen always to present themselves in the same 
<A NAME="32"></A>subject, and to be affections of the same: examples are-health and sickness, 
<A NAME="33"></A>beauty and ugliness, strength and weakness, sight and blindness, hearing 
<A NAME="34"></A>and deafness. This is also clear from the following considerations. The 
<A NAME="35"></A>criterion by which we know the waking person to be awake is identical with 
<A NAME="36"></A>that by which we know the sleeper to be asleep; for we assume that one 
<A NAME="37"></A>who is exercising sense-perception is awake, and that every one who is 
<A NAME="38"></A>awake perceives either some external movement or else some movement in 
<A NAME="39"></A>his own consciousness. If waking, then, consists in nothing else than the 
<A NAME="40"></A>exercise of sense-perception, the inference is clear, that the organ, in 
<A NAME="41"></A>virtue of which animals perceive, is that by which they wake, when they 
<A NAME="42"></A>are awake, or sleep, when they are awake, or sleep, when they are 
<A NAME="43"></A>asleep.
<A NAME="44"></A><BR><BR>But since the exercise of sense-perception does not belong to soul 
<A NAME="45"></A>or body exclusively, then (since the subject of actuality is in every case 
<A NAME="46"></A>identical with that of potentiality, and what is called sense-perception, 
<A NAME="47"></A>as actuality, is a movement of the soul through the body) it is clear that 
<A NAME="48"></A>its affection is not an affection of soul exclusively, and that a soulless 
<A NAME="49"></A>body has not the potentiality of perception. [Thus sleep and waking are 
<A NAME="50"></A>not attributes of pure intelligence, on the one hand, or of inanimate bodies, 
<A NAME="51"></A>on the other.]
<A NAME="52"></A><BR><BR>Now, whereas we have already elsewhere distinguished what are called 
<A NAME="53"></A>the parts of the soul, and whereas the nutrient is, in all living bodies, 
<A NAME="54"></A>capable of existing without the other parts, while none of the others can 
<A NAME="55"></A>exist without the nutrient; it is clear that sleep and waking are not affections 
<A NAME="56"></A>of such living things as partake only of growth and decay, e.g. not of 
<A NAME="57"></A>plants, because these have not the faculty of sense-perception, whether 
<A NAME="58"></A>or not this be capable of separate existence; in its potentiality, indeed, 
<A NAME="59"></A>and in its relationships, it is separable.
<A NAME="60"></A><BR><BR>Likewise it is clear that [of those which either sleep or wake] 
<A NAME="61"></A>there is no animal which is always awake or always asleep, but that both 
<A NAME="62"></A>these affections belong [alternately] to the same animals. For if there 
<A NAME="63"></A>be an animal not endued with sense-perception, it is impossible that this 
<A NAME="64"></A>should either sleep or wake; since both these are affections of the activity 
<A NAME="65"></A>of the primary faculty of sense-perception. But it is equally impossible 
<A NAME="66"></A>also that either of these two affections should perpetually attach itself 
<A NAME="67"></A>to the same animal, e.g. that some species of animal should be always asleep 
<A NAME="68"></A>or always awake, without intermission; for all organs which have a natural 
<A NAME="69"></A>function must lose power when they work beyond the natural time-limit of 
<A NAME="70"></A>their working period; for instance, the eyes [must lose power] from <BR><I>too 
<A NAME="71"></A>long continued</I>
<A NAME="72"></A>seeing, and must give it up; and so it is withthe hand and every other 
<A NAME="73"></A>member which has a function. Now, if sense-perception is the function of 
<A NAME="74"></A>a special organ, this also, if it continues perceiving beyond the appointed 
<A NAME="75"></A>time-limit of its continuous working period, will lose its power, and will 
<A NAME="76"></A>do its work no longer. Accordingly, if the waking period is determined 
<A NAME="77"></A>by this fact, that in it sense-perception is free; if in the case of some 
<A NAME="78"></A>contraries one of the two must be present, while in the case of others 
<A NAME="79"></A>this is not necessary; if waking is the contrary of sleeping, and one of 
<A NAME="80"></A>these two must be present to every animal: it must follow that the state 
<A NAME="81"></A>of sleeping is necessary. Finally, if such affection is Sleep, and this 
<A NAME="82"></A>is a state of powerlessness arising from excess of waking, and excess of 
<A NAME="83"></A>waking is in its origin sometimes morbid, sometimes not, so that the powerlessness 
<A NAME="84"></A>or dissolution of activity will be so or not; it is inevitable that every 
<A NAME="85"></A>creature which wakes must also be capable of sleeping, since it is impossible 
<A NAME="86"></A>that it should continue actualizing its powers perpetually.
<A NAME="87"></A><BR><BR>So, also, it is impossible for any animal to continue always sleeping. 
<A NAME="88"></A>For sleep is an affection of the organ of sense-perception--a sort of tie 
<A NAME="89"></A>or inhibition of function imposed on it, so that every creature that sleeps 
<A NAME="90"></A>must needs have the organ of sense-perception. Now, that alone which is 
<A NAME="91"></A>capable of sense-perception in actuality has the faculty of sense-perception; 
<A NAME="92"></A>but to realize this faculty, in the proper and unqualified sense, is impossible 
<A NAME="93"></A>while one is asleep. All sleep, therefore, must be susceptible of awakening. 
<A NAME="94"></A>Accordingly, almost all other animals are clearly observed to partake in 
<A NAME="95"></A>sleep, whether they are aquatic, aerial, or terrestrial, since fishes of 
<A NAME="96"></A>all kinds, and molluscs, as well as all others which have eyes, have been 
<A NAME="97"></A>seen sleeping. 'Hard-eyed' creatures and insects manifestly assume the 
<A NAME="98"></A>posture of sleep; but the sleep of all such creatures is of brief duration, 
<A NAME="99"></A>so that often it might well baffle one's observation to decide whether 
<A NAME="100"></A>they sleep or not. Of testaceous animals, on the contrary, no direct sensible 
<A NAME="101"></A>evidence is as yet forthcoming to determine whether they sleep, but if 
<A NAME="102"></A>the above reasoning be convincing to any one, he who follows it will admit 
<A NAME="103"></A>this [viz. that they do so.]
<A NAME="104"></A><BR><BR>That, therefore, all animals sleep may be gathered from these considerations. 
<A NAME="105"></A>For an animal is defined as such by its possessing sense-perception; and 
<A NAME="106"></A>we assert that sleep is, in a certain way, an inhibition of function, or, 
<A NAME="107"></A>as it were, a tie, imposed on sense-perception, while its loosening or 
<A NAME="108"></A>remission constitutes the being awake. But no plant can partake in either 
<A NAME="109"></A>of these affections, for without sense-perception there is neither sleeping 
<A NAME="110"></A>nor waking. But creatures which have sense-perception have likewise the 
<A NAME="111"></A>feeling of pain and pleasure, while those which have these have appetite 
<A NAME="112"></A>as well; but plants have none of these affections. A mark of this is that 
<A NAME="113"></A>the nutrient part does its own work better when (the animal) is asleep 
<A NAME="114"></A>than when it is awake. Nutrition and growth are then especially promoted, 
<A NAME="115"></A>a fact which implies that creatures do not need sense-perception to assist 
<A NAME="116"></A>these processes.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="117"></A><B>Part 2</B>

<A NAME="118"></A><BR><BR>We must now proceed to inquire into the cause why one sleeps and 
<A NAME="119"></A>wakes, and into the particular nature of the sense-perception, or sense-perceptions, 
<A NAME="120"></A>if there be several, on which these affections depend. Since, then, some 
<A NAME="121"></A>animals possess all the modes of sense-perception, and some not all, not, 
<A NAME="122"></A>for example, sight, while all possess touch and taste, except such animals 
<A NAME="123"></A>as are imperfectly developed, a class of which we have already treated 
<A NAME="124"></A>in our work on the soul; and since an animal when asleep is unable to exercise, 
<A NAME="125"></A>in the simple sense any particular sensory faculty whatever, it follows 
<A NAME="126"></A>that in the state called sleep the same affection must extend to all the 
<A NAME="127"></A>special senses; because, if it attaches itself to one of them but not to 
<A NAME="128"></A>another, then an animal while asleep may perceive with the latter; but 
<A NAME="129"></A>this is impossible.
<A NAME="130"></A><BR><BR>Now, since every sense has something peculiar, and also something 
<A NAME="131"></A>common; peculiar, as, e.g. seeing is to the sense of sight, hearing to 
<A NAME="132"></A>the auditory sense, and so on with the other senses severally; while all 
<A NAME="133"></A>are accompanied by a common power, in virtue whereof a person perceives 
<A NAME="134"></A>that he sees or hears (for, assuredly, it is not by the special sense of 
<A NAME="135"></A>sight that one sees that he sees; and it is not by mere taste, or sight, 
<A NAME="136"></A>or both together that one discerns, and has the faculty of discerning, 
<A NAME="137"></A>that sweet things are different from white things, but by a faculty connected 
<A NAME="138"></A>in common with all the organs of sense; for there is one sensory function, 
<A NAME="139"></A>and the controlling sensory faculty is one, though differing as a faculty 
<A NAME="140"></A>of perception in relation to each genus of sensibles, e.g. sound or colour); 
<A NAME="141"></A>and since this [common sensory activity] subsists in association chiefly 
<A NAME="142"></A>with the faculty of touch (for this can exist apart from all the other 
<A NAME="143"></A>organs of sense, but none of them can exist apart from it-a subject of 
<A NAME="144"></A>which we have treated in our speculations concerning the Soul); it is therefore 
<A NAME="145"></A>evident that waking and sleeping are an affection of this <BR><I>common 
<A NAME="146"></A>and controlling organ of sense-perception</I>
<A NAME="147"></A>. This explainswhy they belong to all animals, for touch [with which this 
<A NAME="148"></A>common organ is chiefly connected], alone, [is common] to all 
<A NAME="149"></A>[animals].
<A NAME="150"></A><BR><BR>For if sleeping were caused by the special senses having each and 
<A NAME="151"></A>all undergone some affection, it would be strange that these senses, for 
<A NAME="152"></A>which it is neither necessary nor in a manner possible to realize their 
<A NAME="153"></A>powers simultaneously, should necessarily all go idle and become motionless 
<A NAME="154"></A>simultaneously. For the contrary experience, viz. that they should not 
<A NAME="155"></A>go to rest altogether, would have been more reasonably anticipated. But, 
<A NAME="156"></A>according to the explanation just given, all is quite clear regarding those 
<A NAME="157"></A>also. For, when the sense organ which controls all the others, and to which 
<A NAME="158"></A>all the others are tributary, has been in some way affected, that these 
<A NAME="159"></A>others should be all affected at the same time is inevitable, whereas, 
<A NAME="160"></A>if one of the tributaries becomes powerless, that the controlling organ 
<A NAME="161"></A>should also become powerless need in no wise follow.
<A NAME="162"></A><BR><BR>It is indeed evident from many considerations that sleep does not 
<A NAME="163"></A>consist in the mere fact that the special senses do not function or that 
<A NAME="164"></A>one does not employ them; and that it does not consist merely in an inability 
<A NAME="165"></A>to exercise the sense-perceptions; for such is what happens in cases of 
<A NAME="166"></A>swooning. A swoon means just such impotence of perception, and certain 
<A NAME="167"></A>other cases of unconsciousness also are of this nature. Moreover, persons 
<A NAME="168"></A>who have the bloodvessels in the neck compressed become insensible. But 
<A NAME="169"></A>sleep supervenes when such incapacity of exercise has neither arisen in 
<A NAME="170"></A>some casual organ of sense, nor from some chance cause, but when, as has 
<A NAME="171"></A>been just stated, it has its seat in the primary organ with which one perceives 
<A NAME="172"></A>objects in general. For when this has become powerless all the other sensory 
<A NAME="173"></A>organs also must lack power to perceive; but when one of them has become 
<A NAME="174"></A>powerless, it is not necessary for this also to lose its 
<A NAME="175"></A>power.
<A NAME="176"></A><BR><BR>We must next state the cause to which it is due, and its quality 
<A NAME="177"></A>as an affection. Now, since there are several types of cause (for we assign 
<A NAME="178"></A>equally the 'final', the 'efficient', the 'material', and the 'formal' 
<A NAME="179"></A>as causes), in the first place, then, as we assert that Nature operates 
<A NAME="180"></A>for the sake of an end, and that this end is a good; and that to every 
<A NAME="181"></A>creature which is endowed by nature with the power to move, but cannot 
<A NAME="182"></A>with pleasure to itself move always and continuously, rest is necessary 
<A NAME="183"></A>and beneficial; and since, taught by experience, men apply to sleep this 
<A NAME="184"></A>metaphorical term, calling it a 'rest' [from the strain of movement implied 
<A NAME="185"></A>in sense-perception]: we conclude that its end is the conservation of animals. 
<A NAME="186"></A>But the waking state is for an animal its highest end, since the exercise 
<A NAME="187"></A>of sense-perception or of thought is the highest end for all beings to 
<A NAME="188"></A>which either of these appertains; inasmuch as these are best, and the highest 
<A NAME="189"></A>end is what is best: whence it follows that sleep belongs of necessity 
<A NAME="190"></A>to each animal. I use the term 'necessity' in its conditional sense, meaning 
<A NAME="191"></A>that if an animal is to exist and have its own proper nature, it must have 
<A NAME="192"></A>certain endowments; and, if these are to belong to it, certain others likewise 
<A NAME="193"></A>must belong to it <BR><I>as their condition.</I>

<A NAME="194"></A><BR><BR>The next question to be discussed is that of the kind of movement 
<A NAME="195"></A>or action, taking place within their bodies, from which the affection of 
<A NAME="196"></A>waking or sleeping arises in animals. Now, we must assume that the causes 
<A NAME="197"></A>of this affection in all other animals are identical with, or analogous 
<A NAME="198"></A>to, those which operate in sanguineous animals; and that the causes operating 
<A NAME="199"></A>in sanguineous animals generally are identical with those operating in 
<A NAME="200"></A>man. Hence we must consider the entire subject in the light of these instances 
<A NAME="201"></A>[afforded by sanguineous animals, especially man]. Now, it has been definitely 
<A NAME="202"></A>settled already in another work that sense-perception in animals originates 
<A NAME="203"></A>ill the same part of the organism in which movement originates. This locus 
<A NAME="204"></A>of origination is one of three determinate loci, viz. that which lies midway 
<A NAME="205"></A>between the head and the abdomen. This is sanguineous animals is the region 
<A NAME="206"></A>of the heart; for all sanguineous animals have a heart; and from this it 
<A NAME="207"></A>is that both motion and the controlling sense-perception originate. Now, 
<A NAME="208"></A>as regards movement, it is obvious that that of breathing and of the cooling 
<A NAME="209"></A>process generally takes its rise there; and it is with a view to the conservation 
<A NAME="210"></A>of the [due amount of] heat in this part that nature has formed as she 
<A NAME="211"></A>has both the animals which respire, and those which cool themselves by 
<A NAME="212"></A>moisture. Of this [cooling process] per se we shall treat hereafter. In 
<A NAME="213"></A>bloodless animals, and insects, and such as do not respire, the 'connatural 
<A NAME="214"></A>spirit' is seen alternately puffed up and subsiding in the part which is 
<A NAME="215"></A>in them analogous [to the region of the heart in sanguineous animals]. 
<A NAME="216"></A>This is clearly observable in the holoptera [insects with undivided wings] 
<A NAME="217"></A>as wasps and bees; also in flies and such creatures. And since to move 
<A NAME="218"></A>anything, or do anything, is impossible without strength, and holding the 
<A NAME="219"></A>breath produces strength-in creatures which inhale, the holding of that 
<A NAME="220"></A>breath which comes from without, but, in creatures which do not respire, 
<A NAME="221"></A>of that which is connatural (which explains why winged insects of the class 
<A NAME="222"></A>holoptera, when they move, are perceived to make a humming noise, due to 
<A NAME="223"></A>the friction of the connatural spirit colliding with the diaphragm); and 
<A NAME="224"></A>since movement is, in every animal, attended with some sense-perception, 
<A NAME="225"></A>either internal or external, in the primary organ of sense, [we conclude] 
<A NAME="226"></A>accordingly that if sleeping and waking are affections of this organ, the 
<A NAME="227"></A>place in which, or the organ in which, sleep and waking originate, is self-evident 
<A NAME="228"></A>[being that in which movement and sense-perception originate, viz. the 
<A NAME="229"></A>heart].
<A NAME="230"></A><BR><BR>Some persons move in their sleep, and perform many acts like waking 
<A NAME="231"></A>acts, but not without a phantasm or an exercise of sense-perception; for 
<A NAME="232"></A>a dream is in a certain way a sense-impression. But of them we have to 
<A NAME="233"></A>speak later on. Why it is that persons when aroused remember their dreams, 
<A NAME="234"></A>but do not remember these acts which are like waking acts, has been already 
<A NAME="235"></A>explained in the work 'Of Problems'.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="236"></A><B>Part 3</B>

<A NAME="237"></A><BR><BR>The point for consideration next in order to the preceding is:-What 
<A NAME="238"></A>are the processes in which the affection of waking and sleeping originates, 
<A NAME="239"></A>and whence do they arise? Now, since it is when it has sense-perception 
<A NAME="240"></A>that an animal must first take food and receive growth, and in all cases 
<A NAME="241"></A>food in its ultimate form is, in sanguineous animals, the natural substance 
<A NAME="242"></A>blood, or, in bloodless animals, that which is analogous to this; and since 
<A NAME="243"></A>the veins are the place of the blood, while the origin of these is the 
<A NAME="244"></A>heart-an assertion which is proved by anatomy-it is manifest that, when 
<A NAME="245"></A>the external nutriment enters the parts fitted for its reception, the evaporation 
<A NAME="246"></A>arising from it enters into the veins, and there, undergoing a change, 
<A NAME="247"></A>is converted into blood, and makes its way to their source [the heart]. 
<A NAME="248"></A>We have treated of all this when discussing the subject of nutrition, but 
<A NAME="249"></A>must here recapitulate what was there said, in order that we may obtain 
<A NAME="250"></A>a scientific view of the beginnings of the process, and come to know what 
<A NAME="251"></A>exactly happens to the primary organ of sense-perception to account for 
<A NAME="252"></A>the occurrence of waking and sleep. For sleep, as has been shown, is not 
<A NAME="253"></A>any given impotence of the perceptive faculty; for unconsciousness, a certain 
<A NAME="254"></A>form of asphyxia, and swooning, all produce such impotence. Moreover it 
<A NAME="255"></A>is an established fact that some persons in a profound trance have still 
<A NAME="256"></A>had the imaginative faculty in play. This last point, indeed, gives rise 
<A NAME="257"></A>to a difficulty; for if it is conceivable that one who had swooned should 
<A NAME="258"></A>in this state fall asleep, the phantasm also which then presented itself 
<A NAME="259"></A>to his mind might be regarded as a dream. Persons, too, who have fallen 
<A NAME="260"></A>into a deep trance, and have come to be regarded as dead, say many things 
<A NAME="261"></A>while in this condition. The same view, however, is to be taken of all 
<A NAME="262"></A>these cases, [i.e. that they are not cases of sleeping or 
<A NAME="263"></A>dreaming].
<A NAME="264"></A><BR><BR>As we observed above, sleep is not co-extensive with any and every 
<A NAME="265"></A>impotence of the perceptive faculty, but this affection is one which arises 
<A NAME="266"></A>from the evaporation attendant upon the process of nutrition. The matter 
<A NAME="267"></A>evaporated must be driven onwards to a certain point, then turn back, and 
<A NAME="268"></A>change its current to and fro, like a tide-race in a narrow strait. Now, 
<A NAME="269"></A>in every animal the hot naturally tends to move [and carry other things] 
<A NAME="270"></A>upwards, but when it has reached the parts above [becoming cool], it turns 
<A NAME="271"></A>back again, and moves downwards in a mass. This explains why fits of drowsiness 
<A NAME="272"></A>are especially apt to come on after meals; for the matter, both the liquid 
<A NAME="273"></A>and the corporeal, which is borne upwards in a mass, is then of considerable 
<A NAME="274"></A>quantity. When, therefore, this comes to a stand it weighs a person down 
<A NAME="275"></A>and causes him to nod, but when it has actually sunk downwards, and by 
<A NAME="276"></A>its return has repulsed the hot, sleep comes on, and the animal so affected 
<A NAME="277"></A>is presently asleep. A confirmation of this appears from considering the 
<A NAME="278"></A>things which induce sleep; they all, whether potable or edible, for instance 
<A NAME="279"></A>poppy, mandragora, wine, darnel, produce a heaviness in the head; and persons 
<A NAME="280"></A>borne down [by sleepiness] and nodding [drowsily] all seem affected in 
<A NAME="281"></A>this way, i.e. they are unable to lift up the head or the eye-lids. And 
<A NAME="282"></A>it is after meals especially that sleep comes on like this, for the evaporation 
<A NAME="283"></A>from the foods eaten is then copious. It also follows certain forms of 
<A NAME="284"></A>fatigue; for fatigue operates as a solvent, and the dissolved matter acts, 
<A NAME="285"></A>if not cold, like food prior to digestion. Moreover, some kinds of illness 
<A NAME="286"></A>have this same effect; those arising from moist and hot secretions, as 
<A NAME="287"></A>happens with fever-patients and in cases of lethargy. Extreme youth also 
<A NAME="288"></A>has this effect; infants, for example, sleep a great deal, because of the 
<A NAME="289"></A>food being all borne upwards-a mark whereof appears in the disproportionately 
<A NAME="290"></A>large size of the upper parts compared with the lower during infancy, which 
<A NAME="291"></A>is due to the fact that growth predominates in the direction of the former. 
<A NAME="292"></A>Hence also they are subject to epileptic seizures; for sleep is like epilepsy, 
<A NAME="293"></A>and, in a sense, actually is a seizure of this sort. Accordingly, the beginning 
<A NAME="294"></A>of this malady takes place with many during sleep, and their subsequent 
<A NAME="295"></A>habitual seizures occur in sleep, not in waking hours. For when the spirit 
<A NAME="296"></A>[evaporation] moves upwards in a volume, on its return downwards it distends 
<A NAME="297"></A>the veins, and forcibly compresses the passage through which respiration 
<A NAME="298"></A>is effected. This explains why wines are not good for infants or for wet 
<A NAME="299"></A>nurses (for it makes no difference, doubtless, whether the infants themselves, 
<A NAME="300"></A>or their nurses, drink them), but such persons should drink them [if at 
<A NAME="301"></A>all] diluted with water and in small quantity. For wine is spirituous, 
<A NAME="302"></A>and of all wines the dark more so than any other. The upper parts, in infants, 
<A NAME="303"></A>are so filled with nutriment that within five months <BR><I>after 
<A NAME="304"></A>birth</I>
<A NAME="305"></A>they do not even turn the neck [sc. to raise thehead]; for in them, as 
<A NAME="306"></A>in persons deeply intoxicated, there is ever a large quantity of moisture 
<A NAME="307"></A>ascending. It is reasonable, too, to think that this affection is the cause 
<A NAME="308"></A>of the embryo's remaining at rest in the womb at first. Also, as a general 
<A NAME="309"></A>rule, persons whose veins are inconspicuous, as well as those who are dwarf-like, 
<A NAME="310"></A>or have abnormally large heads, are addicted to sleep. For in the former 
<A NAME="311"></A>the veins are narrow, so that it is not easy for the moisture to flow down 
<A NAME="312"></A>through them; while in the case of dwarfs and those whose heads are abnormally 
<A NAME="313"></A>large, the impetus of the evaporation upwards is excessive. Those [on the 
<A NAME="314"></A>contrary] whose veins are large are, thanks to the easy flow through the 
<A NAME="315"></A>veins, not addicted to sleep, unless, indeed, they labour under some other 
<A NAME="316"></A>affection which counteracts [this easy flow]. Nor are the 'atrabilious' 
<A NAME="317"></A>addicted to sleep, for in them the inward region is cooled so that the 
<A NAME="318"></A>quantity of evaporation in their case is not great. For this reason they 
<A NAME="319"></A>have large appetites, though spare and lean; for their bodily condition 
<A NAME="320"></A>is as if they derived no benefit from what they eat. The dark bile, too, 
<A NAME="321"></A>being itself naturally cold, cools also the nutrient tract, and the other 
<A NAME="322"></A>parts wheresoever such secretion is potentially present <BR><I>i.e. tends 
<A NAME="323"></A>to be formed</I>
<A NAME="324"></A>.
<A NAME="325"></A><BR><BR>Hence it is plain from what has been said that sleep is a sort 
<A NAME="326"></A>of concentration, or natural recoil, of the hot matter inwards [towards 
<A NAME="327"></A>its centre], due to the cause above mentioned. Hence restless movement 
<A NAME="328"></A>is a marked feature in the case of a person when drowsy. But where it [the 
<A NAME="329"></A>heat in the upper and outer parts] begins to fail, he grows cool, and owing 
<A NAME="330"></A>to this cooling process his eye-lids droop. Accordingly [in sleep] the 
<A NAME="331"></A>upper and outward parts are cool, but the inward and lower, i.e. the parts 
<A NAME="332"></A>at the feet and in the interior of the body, are hot.
<A NAME="333"></A><BR><BR>Yet one might found a difficulty on the facts that sleep is most 
<A NAME="334"></A>oppressive in its onset after meals, and that wine, and other such things, 
<A NAME="335"></A>though they possess heating properties, are productive of sleep, for it 
<A NAME="336"></A>is not probable that sleep should be a process of cooling while the things 
<A NAME="337"></A>that cause sleeping are themselves hot. Is the explanation of this, then, 
<A NAME="338"></A>to be found in the fact that, as the stomach when empty is hot, while replenishment 
<A NAME="339"></A>cools it by the movement it occasions, so the passages and tracts in the 
<A NAME="340"></A>head are cooled as the 'evaporation' ascends thither? Or, as those who 
<A NAME="341"></A>have hot water poured on them feel a sudden shiver of cold, just so in 
<A NAME="342"></A>the case before us, may it be that, when the hot substance ascends, the 
<A NAME="343"></A>cold rallying to meet it cools [the aforesaid parts] deprives their native 
<A NAME="344"></A>heat of all its power, and compels it to retire? Moreover, when much food 
<A NAME="345"></A>is taken, which [i.e. the nutrient evaporation from which] the hot substance 
<A NAME="346"></A>carries upwards, this latter, like a fire when fresh logs are laid upon 
<A NAME="347"></A>it, is itself cooled, until the food has been digested.
<A NAME="348"></A><BR><BR>For, as has been observed elsewhere, sleep comes on when the corporeal 
<A NAME="349"></A>element [in the 'evaporation'] conveyed upwards by the hot, along the veins, 
<A NAME="350"></A>to the head. But when that which has been thus carried up can no longer 
<A NAME="351"></A>ascend, but is too great in quantity [to do so], it forces the hot back 
<A NAME="352"></A>again and flows downwards. Hence it is that men sink down [as they do in 
<A NAME="353"></A>sleep] when the heat which tends to keep them erect (man alone, among animals, 
<A NAME="354"></A>being naturally erect) is withdrawn; and this, when it befalls them, causes 
<A NAME="355"></A>unconsciousness, and afterwards phantasy.
<A NAME="356"></A><BR><BR>Or are the solutions thus proposed barely conceivable accounts 
<A NAME="357"></A>of the refrigeration which takes place, while, as a matter of fact, the 
<A NAME="358"></A>region of the brain is, as stated elsewhere, the main determinant of the 
<A NAME="359"></A>matter? For the brain, or in creatures without a brain that which corresponds 
<A NAME="360"></A>to it, is of all parts of the body the coolest. Therefore, as moisture 
<A NAME="361"></A>turned into vapour by the sun's heat is, when it has ascended to the upper 
<A NAME="362"></A>regions, cooled by the coldness of the latter, and becoming condensed, 
<A NAME="363"></A>is carried downwards, and turned into water once more; just so the excrementitious 
<A NAME="364"></A>evaporation, when carried up by the heat to the region of the brain, is 
<A NAME="365"></A>condensed into a 'phlegm' (which explains why catarrhs are seen to proceed 
<A NAME="366"></A>from the head); while that evaporation which is nutrient and not unwholesome, 
<A NAME="367"></A>becoming condensed, descends and cools the hot. The tenuity or narrowness 
<A NAME="368"></A>of the veins about the brain itself contributes to its being kept cool, 
<A NAME="369"></A>and to its not readily admitting the evaporation. This, then, is a sufficient 
<A NAME="370"></A>explanation of the cooling which takes place, despite the fact that the 
<A NAME="371"></A>evaporation is exceedingly hot.
<A NAME="372"></A><BR><BR>A person awakes from sleep when digestion is completed: when the 
<A NAME="373"></A>heat, which had been previously forced together in large quantity within 
<A NAME="374"></A>a small compass from out the surrounding part, has once more prevailed, 
<A NAME="375"></A>and when a separation has been effected between the more corporeal and 
<A NAME="376"></A>the purer blood. The finest and purest blood is that contained in the head, 
<A NAME="377"></A>while the thickest and most turbid is that in the lower parts. The source 
<A NAME="378"></A>of all the blood is, as has been stated both here and elsewhere, the heart. 
<A NAME="379"></A>Now of the chambers in the heart the central communicates with each of 
<A NAME="380"></A>the two others. Each of the latter again acts as receiver from each, respectively, 
<A NAME="381"></A>of the two vessels, called the 'great' and the 'aorta'. It is in the central 
<A NAME="382"></A>chamber that the [above-mentioned] separation takes place. To go into these 
<A NAME="383"></A>matters in detail would, however, be more properly the business of a different 
<A NAME="384"></A>treatise from the present. Owing to the fact that the blood formed after 
<A NAME="385"></A>the assimilation of food is especially in need of separation, sleep [then 
<A NAME="386"></A>especially] occurs [and lasts] until the purest part of this blood has 
<A NAME="387"></A>been separated off into the upper parts of the body, and the most turbid 
<A NAME="388"></A>into the lower parts. When this has taken place animals awake from sleep, 
<A NAME="389"></A>being released from the heaviness consequent on taking food. We have now 
<A NAME="390"></A>stated the cause of sleeping, viz. that it consists in the recoil by the 
<A NAME="391"></A>corporeal element, upborne by the connatural heat, in a mass upon the primary 
<A NAME="392"></A>sense-organ; we have also stated what sleep is, having shown that it is 
<A NAME="393"></A>a seizure of the primary sense-organ, rendering it unable to actualize 
<A NAME="394"></A>its powers; arising of necessity (for it is impossible for an animal to 
<A NAME="395"></A>exist if the conditions which render it an animal be not fulfilled), i.e. 
<A NAME="396"></A>for the sake of its conservation; since remission of movement tends to 
<A NAME="397"></A>the conservation of animals.
