<A NAME="10"></A><B>Part 1</B>
<A NAME="11"></A><BR><BR>"<BR><BR>
<A NAME="12"></A><BR><BR>"THE investigation of the truth is in one way hard, in another 
<A NAME="13"></A>easy. An indication of this is found in the fact that no one is able to 
<A NAME="14"></A>attain the truth adequately, while, on the other hand, we do not collectively 
<A NAME="15"></A>fail, but every one says something true about the nature of things, and 
<A NAME="16"></A>while individually we contribute little or nothing to the truth, by the 
<A NAME="17"></A>union of all a considerable amount is amassed. Therefore, since the truth 
<A NAME="18"></A>seems to be like the proverbial door, which no one can fail to hit, in 
<A NAME="19"></A>this respect it must be easy, but the fact that we can have a whole truth 
<A NAME="20"></A>and not the particular part we aim at shows the difficulty of it. <BR><BR>"Perhaps, 
<A NAME="21"></A>too, as difficulties are of two kinds, the cause of the present difficulty 
<A NAME="22"></A>is not in the facts but in us. For as the eyes of bats are to the blaze 
<A NAME="23"></A>of day, so is the reason in our soul to the things which are by nature 
<A NAME="24"></A>most evident of all. <BR><BR>"It is just that we should be grateful, not 
<A NAME="25"></A>only to those with whose views we may agree, but also to those who have 
<A NAME="26"></A>expressed more superficial views; for these also contributed something, 
<A NAME="27"></A>by developing before us the powers of thought. It is true that if there 
<A NAME="28"></A>had been no Timotheus we should have been without much of our lyric poetry; 
<A NAME="29"></A>but if there had been no Phrynis there would have been no Timotheus. The 
<A NAME="30"></A>same holds good of those who have expressed views about the truth; for 
<A NAME="31"></A>from some thinkers we have inherited certain opinions, while the others 
<A NAME="32"></A>have been responsible for the appearance of the former. <BR><BR>"It is 
<A NAME="33"></A>right also that philosophy should be called knowledge of the truth. For 
<A NAME="34"></A>the end of theoretical knowledge is truth, while that of practical knowledge 
<A NAME="35"></A>is action (for even if they consider how things are, practical men do not 
<A NAME="36"></A>study the eternal, but what is relative and in the present). Now we do 
<A NAME="37"></A>not know a truth without its cause; and a thing has a quality in a higher 
<A NAME="38"></A>degree than other things if in virtue of it the similar quality belongs 
<A NAME="39"></A>to the other things as well (e.g. fire is the hottest of things; for it 
<A NAME="40"></A>is the cause of the heat of all other things); so that that causes derivative 
<A NAME="41"></A>truths to be true is most true. Hence the principles of eternal things 
<A NAME="42"></A>must be always most true (for they are not merely sometimes true, nor is 
<A NAME="43"></A>there any cause of their being, but they themselves are the cause of the 
<A NAME="44"></A>being of other things), so that as each thing is in respect of being, so 
<A NAME="45"></A>is it in respect of truth.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="46"></A><B>Part 2</B>
<A NAME="47"></A>"<BR><BR>
<A NAME="48"></A><BR><BR>"But evidently there is a first principle, and the causes of things 
<A NAME="49"></A>are neither an infinite series nor infinitely various in kind. For neither 
<A NAME="50"></A>can one thing proceed from another, as from matter, ad infinitum (e.g. 
<A NAME="51"></A>flesh from earth, earth from air, air from fire, and so on without stopping), 
<A NAME="52"></A>nor can the sources of movement form an endless series (man for instance 
<A NAME="53"></A>being acted on by air, air by the sun, the sun by Strife, and so on without 
<A NAME="54"></A>limit). Similarly the final causes cannot go on ad infinitum,-walking being 
<A NAME="55"></A>for the sake of health, this for the sake of happiness, happiness for the 
<A NAME="56"></A>sake of something else, and so one thing always for the sake of another. 
<A NAME="57"></A>And the case of the essence is similar. For in the case of intermediates, 
<A NAME="58"></A>which have a last term and a term prior to them, the prior must be the 
<A NAME="59"></A>cause of the later terms. For if we had to say which of the three is the 
<A NAME="60"></A>cause, we should say the first; surely not the last, for the final term 
<A NAME="61"></A>is the cause of none; nor even the intermediate, for it is the cause only 
<A NAME="62"></A>of one. (It makes no difference whether there is one intermediate or more, 
<A NAME="63"></A>nor whether they are infinite or finite in number.) But of series which 
<A NAME="64"></A>are infinite in this way, and of the infinite in general, all the parts 
<A NAME="65"></A>down to that now present are alike intermediates; so that if there is no 
<A NAME="66"></A>first there is no cause at all. <BR><BR>"Nor can there be an infinite process 
<A NAME="67"></A>downwards, with a beginning in the upward direction, so that water should 
<A NAME="68"></A>proceed from fire, earth from water, and so always some other kind should 
<A NAME="69"></A>be produced. For one thing comes from another in two ways-not in the sense 
<A NAME="70"></A>in which 'from' means 'after' (as we say 'from the Isthmian games come 
<A NAME="71"></A>the Olympian'), but either (i) as the man comes from the boy, by the boy's 
<A NAME="72"></A>changing, or (ii) as air comes from water. By 'as the man comes from the 
<A NAME="73"></A>boy' we mean 'as that which has come to be from that which is coming to 
<A NAME="74"></A>be' or 'as that which is finished from that which is being achieved' (for 
<A NAME="75"></A>as becoming is between being and not being, so that which is becoming is 
<A NAME="76"></A>always between that which is and that which is not; for the learner is 
<A NAME="77"></A>a man of science in the making, and this is what is meant when we say that 
<A NAME="78"></A>from a learner a man of science is being made); on the other hand, coming 
<A NAME="79"></A>from another thing as water comes from air implies the destruction of the 
<A NAME="80"></A>other thing. This is why changes of the former kind are not reversible, 
<A NAME="81"></A>and the boy does not come from the man (for it is not that which comes 
<A NAME="82"></A>to be something that comes to be as a result of coming to be, but that 
<A NAME="83"></A>which exists after the coming to be; for it is thus that the day, too, 
<A NAME="84"></A>comes from the morning-in the sense that it comes after the morning; which 
<A NAME="85"></A>is the reason why the morning cannot come from the day); but changes of 
<A NAME="86"></A>the other kind are reversible. But in both cases it is impossible that 
<A NAME="87"></A>the number of terms should be infinite. For terms of the former kind, being 
<A NAME="88"></A>intermediates, must have an end, and terms of the latter kind change back 
<A NAME="89"></A>into one another, for the destruction of either is the generation of the 
<A NAME="90"></A>other. <BR><BR>"At the same time it is impossible that the first cause, 
<A NAME="91"></A>being eternal, should be destroyed; for since the process of becoming is 
<A NAME="92"></A>not infinite in the upward direction, that which is the first thing by 
<A NAME="93"></A>whose destruction something came to be must be non-eternal. <BR><BR>"Further, 
<A NAME="94"></A>the final cause is an end, and that sort of end which is not for the sake 
<A NAME="95"></A>of something else, but for whose sake everything else is; so that if there 
<A NAME="96"></A>is to be a last term of this sort, the process will not be infinite; but 
<A NAME="97"></A>if there is no such term, there will be no final cause, but those who maintain 
<A NAME="98"></A>the infinite series eliminate the Good without knowing it (yet no one would 
<A NAME="99"></A>try to do anything if he were not going to come to a limit); nor would 
<A NAME="100"></A>there be reason in the world; the reasonable man, at least, always acts 
<A NAME="101"></A>for a purpose, and this is a limit; for the end is a limit. <BR><BR>"But 
<A NAME="102"></A>the essence, also, cannot be reduced to another definition which is fuller 
<A NAME="103"></A>in expression. For the original definition is always more of a definition, 
<A NAME="104"></A>and not the later one; and in a series in which the first term has not 
<A NAME="105"></A>the required character, the next has not it either. Further, those who 
<A NAME="106"></A>speak thus destroy science; for it is not possible to have this till one 
<A NAME="107"></A>comes to the unanalysable terms. And knowledge becomes impossible; for 
<A NAME="108"></A>how can one apprehend things that are infinite in this way? For this is 
<A NAME="109"></A>not like the case of the line, to whose divisibility there is no stop, 
<A NAME="110"></A>but which we cannot think if we do not make a stop (for which reason one 
<A NAME="111"></A>who is tracing the infinitely divisible line cannot be counting the possibilities 
<A NAME="112"></A>of section), but the whole line also must be apprehended by something in 
<A NAME="113"></A>us that does not move from part to part.-Again, nothing infinite can exist; 
<A NAME="114"></A>and if it could, at least the notion of infinity is not infinite. <BR><BR>"But 
<A NAME="115"></A>if the kinds of causes had been infinite in number, then also knowledge 
<A NAME="116"></A>would have been impossible; for we think we know, only when we have ascertained 
<A NAME="117"></A>the causes, that but that which is infinite by addition cannot be gone 
<A NAME="118"></A>through in a finite time.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="119"></A><B>Part 3</B>
<A NAME="120"></A>"<BR><BR>
<A NAME="121"></A><BR><BR>"The effect which lectures produce on a hearer depends on his habits; 
<A NAME="122"></A>for we demand the language we are accustomed to, and that which is different 
<A NAME="123"></A>from this seems not in keeping but somewhat unintelligible and foreign 
<A NAME="124"></A>because of its unwontedness. For it is the customary that is intelligible. 
<A NAME="125"></A>The force of habit is shown by the laws, in which the legendary and childish 
<A NAME="126"></A>elements prevail over our knowledge about them, owing to habit. Thus some 
<A NAME="127"></A>people do not listen to a speaker unless he speaks mathematically, others 
<A NAME="128"></A>unless he gives instances, while others expect him to cite a poet as witness. 
<A NAME="129"></A>And some want to have everything done accurately, while others are annoyed 
<A NAME="130"></A>by accuracy, either because they cannot follow the connexion of thought 
<A NAME="131"></A>or because they regard it as pettifoggery. For accuracy has something of 
<A NAME="132"></A>this character, so that as in trade so in argument some people think it 
<A NAME="133"></A>mean. Hence one must be already trained to know how to take each sort of 
<A NAME="134"></A>argument, since it is absurd to seek at the same time knowledge and the 
<A NAME="135"></A>way of attaining knowledge; and it is not easy to get even one of the two. 
<A NAME="136"></A><BR><BR>"The minute accuracy of mathematics is not to be demanded in all 
<A NAME="137"></A>cases, but only in the case of things which have no matter. Hence method 
<A NAME="138"></A>is not that of natural science; for presumably the whole of nature has 
<A NAME="139"></A>matter. Hence we must inquire first what nature is: for thus we shall also 
<A NAME="140"></A>see what natural science treats of (and whether it belongs to one science 
<A NAME="141"></A>or to more to investigate the causes and the principles of 
<A NAME="142"></A>things).
