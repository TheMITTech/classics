<A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A><B>Part 1</B>
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="11"></A>The account which has now been given of the viscera, the stomach, and the 
<A NAME="12"></A>other several parts holds equally good not only for the oviparous quadrupeds, 
<A NAME="13"></A>but also for such apodous animals as the Serpents. These two classes of 
<A NAME="14"></A>animals are indeed nearly akin, a serpent resembling a lizard which has 
<A NAME="15"></A>been lengthened out and deprived of its feet. Fishes, again, resemble these 
<A NAME="16"></A>two groups in all their parts, excepting that, while these, being land 
<A NAME="17"></A>animals, have a lung, fishes have no lung, but gills in its place. None 
<A NAME="18"></A>of these animals, excepting the tortoise, as also no fish, has a urinary 
<A NAME="19"></A>bladder. For owing to the bloodlessness of their lung, they drink but sparingly; 
<A NAME="20"></A>and such fluid as they have is diverted to the scaly plates, as in birds 
<A NAME="21"></A>it is diverted to the feathers, and thus they come to have the same white 
<A NAME="22"></A>matter on the surface of their excrement as we see on that of birds. For 
<A NAME="23"></A>in animals that have a bladder, its excretion when voided throws down a 
<A NAME="24"></A>deposit of earthy brine in the containing vessel. For the sweet and fresh 
<A NAME="25"></A>elements, being light, are expended on the flesh.
<A NAME="26"></A><BR><BR>Among the Serpents, the same peculiarity attaches to vipers, as 
<A NAME="27"></A>among fishes attaches to Selachia. For both these and vipers are externally 
<A NAME="28"></A>viviparous, but previously produce ova internally.
<A NAME="29"></A><BR><BR>The stomach in all these animals is single, just as it is single 
<A NAME="30"></A>in all other animals that have teeth in front of both jaws; and their viscera 
<A NAME="31"></A>are excessively small, as always happens when there is no bladder. In serpents 
<A NAME="32"></A>these viscera are, moreover, differently shaped from those of other animals. 
<A NAME="33"></A>For, a serpent's body being long and narrow, its contents are as it were 
<A NAME="34"></A>moulded into a similar form, and thus come to be themselves 
<A NAME="35"></A>elongated.
<A NAME="36"></A><BR><BR>All animals that have blood possess an omentum, a mesentery, intestines 
<A NAME="37"></A>with their appendages, and, moreover, a diaphragm and a heart; and all, 
<A NAME="38"></A>excepting fishes, a lung and a windpipe. The relative positions, moreover, 
<A NAME="39"></A>of the windpipe and the oesophagus are precisely similar in them all; and 
<A NAME="40"></A>the reason is the same as has already been given.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="41"></A><B>Part 2</B>

<A NAME="42"></A><BR><BR>Almost all sanguineous animals have a gall-bladder. In some this 
<A NAME="43"></A>is attached to the liver, in others separated from that organ and attached 
<A NAME="44"></A>to the intestines, being apparently in the latter case no less than in 
<A NAME="45"></A>the former an appendage of the lower stomach. It is in fishes that this 
<A NAME="46"></A>is most clearly seen. For all fishes have a gall-bladder; and in most of 
<A NAME="47"></A>them it is attached to the intestine, being in some, as in the Amia, united 
<A NAME="48"></A>with this, like a border, along its whole length. It is similarly placed 
<A NAME="49"></A>in most serpents There are therefore no good grounds for the view entertained 
<A NAME="50"></A>by some writers, that the gall exists for the sake of some sensory action. 
<A NAME="51"></A>For they say that its use is to affect that part of the soul which is lodged 
<A NAME="52"></A>in the neighbourhood of the liver, vexing this part when it is congealed, 
<A NAME="53"></A>and restoring it to cheerfulness when it again flows free. But this cannot 
<A NAME="54"></A>be. For in some animals there is absolutely no gall-bladder at all--in 
<A NAME="55"></A>the horse, for instance, the mule, the ass, the deer, and the roe; and 
<A NAME="56"></A>in others, as the camel, there is no distinct bladder, but merely small 
<A NAME="57"></A>vessels of a biliary character. Again, there is no such organ in the seal, 
<A NAME="58"></A>nor, of purely sea-animals, in the dolphin. Even within the limits of the 
<A NAME="59"></A>same genus, some animals appear to have and others to be without it. Such, 
<A NAME="60"></A>for instance, is the case with mice; such also with man. For in some individuals 
<A NAME="61"></A>there is a distinct gall-bladder attached to the liver, while in others 
<A NAME="62"></A>there is no gall-bladder at all. This explains how the existence of this 
<A NAME="63"></A>part in the whole genus has been a matter of dispute. For each observer, 
<A NAME="64"></A>according as he has found it present or absent in the individual cases 
<A NAME="65"></A>he has examined, has supposed it to be present or absent in the whole genus. 
<A NAME="66"></A>The same has occurred in the case of sheep and of goats. For these animals 
<A NAME="67"></A>usually have a gall-bladder; but, while in some localities it is so enormously 
<A NAME="68"></A>big as to appear a monstrosity, as is the case in Naxos, in others it is 
<A NAME="69"></A>altogether wanting, as is the case in a certain district belonging to the 
<A NAME="70"></A>inhabitants of Chalcis in Euboea. Moreover, the gall-bladder in fishes 
<A NAME="71"></A>is separated, as already mentioned, by a considerable interval from the 
<A NAME="72"></A>liver. No less mistaken seems to be the opinion of Anaxagoras and his followers, 
<A NAME="73"></A>that the gall-bladder is the cause of acute diseases, inasmuch as it becomes 
<A NAME="74"></A>over-full, and spirts out its excess on to the lung, the blood-vessels, 
<A NAME="75"></A>and the ribs. For, almost invariably, those who suffer from these forms 
<A NAME="76"></A>of disease are persons who have no gall-bladder at all, as would be quite 
<A NAME="77"></A>evident were they to be dissected. Moreover, there is no kind of correspondence 
<A NAME="78"></A>between the amount of bile which is present in these diseases and the amount 
<A NAME="79"></A>which is exuded. The most probable opinion is that, as the bile when it 
<A NAME="80"></A>is present in any other part of the body is a mere residuum or a product 
<A NAME="81"></A>of decay, so also when it is present in the region of the liver it is equally 
<A NAME="82"></A>excremental and has no further use; just as is the case with the dejections 
<A NAME="83"></A>of the stomach and intestines. For though even the residua are occasionally 
<A NAME="84"></A>used by nature for some useful purpose, yet we must not in all cases expect 
<A NAME="85"></A>to find such a final cause; for granted the existence in the body of this 
<A NAME="86"></A>or that constituent, with such and such properties, many results must ensue 
<A NAME="87"></A>merely as necessary consequences of these properties. All animals, then, 
<A NAME="88"></A>whose is healthy in composition and supplied with none but sweet blood, 
<A NAME="89"></A>are either entirely without a gall-bladder on this organ, or have merely 
<A NAME="90"></A>small bile-containing vessels; or are some with and some without such parts. 
<A NAME="91"></A>Thus it is that the liver in animals that have no gall-bladder is, as a 
<A NAME="92"></A>rule, of good colour and sweet; and that, when there is a gall-bladder, 
<A NAME="93"></A>that part of the liver is sweetest which lies immediately underneath it. 
<A NAME="94"></A>But, when animals are formed of blood less pure in composition, the bile 
<A NAME="95"></A>serves for the excretion of its impure residue. For the very meaning of 
<A NAME="96"></A>excrement is that it is the opposite of nutriment, and of bitter that it 
<A NAME="97"></A>is the opposite of sweet; and healthy blood is sweet. So that it is evident 
<A NAME="98"></A>that the bile, which is bitter, cannot have any use, but must simply be 
<A NAME="99"></A>a purifying excretion. It was therefore no bad saying of old writers that 
<A NAME="100"></A>the absence of a gall-bladder gave long life. In so saying they had in 
<A NAME="101"></A>mind deer and animals with solid hoofs. For such have no gall-bladder and 
<A NAME="102"></A>live long. But besides these there are other animals that have no gall-bladder, 
<A NAME="103"></A>though those old writers had not noticed the fact, such as the camel and 
<A NAME="104"></A>the dolphin; and these also are, as it happens, long-lived. Seeing, indeed, 
<A NAME="105"></A>that the liver is not only useful, but a necessary and vital part in all 
<A NAME="106"></A>animals that have blood, it is but reasonable that on its character should 
<A NAME="107"></A>depend the length or the shortness of life. Nor less reasonable is it that 
<A NAME="108"></A>this organ and none other should have such an excretion as the bile. For 
<A NAME="109"></A>the heart, unable as it is to stand any violent affection, would be utterly 
<A NAME="110"></A>intolerant of the proximity of such a fluid; and, as to the rest of the 
<A NAME="111"></A>viscera, none excepting the liver are necessary parts of an animal. It 
<A NAME="112"></A>is the liver therefore that alone has this provision. In conclusion, wherever 
<A NAME="113"></A>we see bile we must take it to be excremental. For to suppose that it has 
<A NAME="114"></A>one character in this part, another in that, would be as great an absurdity 
<A NAME="115"></A>as to suppose mucus or the dejections of the stomach to vary in character 
<A NAME="116"></A>according to locality and not to be excremental wherever 
<A NAME="117"></A>found.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="118"></A><B>Part 3</B>

<A NAME="119"></A><BR><BR>So much then of the gall-bladder, and of the reasons why some animals 
<A NAME="120"></A>have one, while others have not. We have still to speak of the mesentery 
<A NAME="121"></A>and the omentum; for these are associated with the parts already described 
<A NAME="122"></A>and contained in the same cavity. The omentum, then, is a membrane containing 
<A NAME="123"></A>fat; the fat being suet or lard, according as the fat of the animal generally 
<A NAME="124"></A>is of the former or latter description. What kinds of animals are so distinguished 
<A NAME="125"></A>has been already set forth in an earlier part of this treatise. This membrane, 
<A NAME="126"></A>alike in animals that have a single and in those that have a multiple stomach, 
<A NAME="127"></A>grows from the middle of that organ, along a line which is marked on it 
<A NAME="128"></A>like a seam. Thus attached, it covers the rest of the stomach and the greater 
<A NAME="129"></A>part of the bowels, and this alike in all sanguineous animals, whether 
<A NAME="130"></A>they live on land or in water. Now the development of this part into such 
<A NAME="131"></A>a form as has been described is the result of necessity. For, whenever 
<A NAME="132"></A>solid and fluid are mixed together and heated, the surface invariably becomes 
<A NAME="133"></A>membranous and skin-like. But the region in which the omentum lies is full 
<A NAME="134"></A>of nutriment of such a mixed character. Moreover, in consequence of the 
<A NAME="135"></A>close texture of the membrane, that portion of the sanguineous nutriment 
<A NAME="136"></A>will alone filter into it which is of a greasy character; for this portion 
<A NAME="137"></A>is composed of the finest particles; and when it has so filtered in, it 
<A NAME="138"></A>will be concocted by the heat of the part, and will be converted into suet 
<A NAME="139"></A>or lard, and will not acquire a flesh-like or sanguineous constitution. 
<A NAME="140"></A>The development, then, of the omentum is simply the result of necessity. 
<A NAME="141"></A>But when once formed, it is used by nature for an end, namely, to facilitate 
<A NAME="142"></A>and to hasten the concoction of food. For all that is hot aids concoction; 
<A NAME="143"></A>and fat is hot, and the omentum is fat. This too explains why it hangs 
<A NAME="144"></A>from the middle of the stomach; for the upper part of the stomach has no 
<A NAME="145"></A>need of it, being assisted in concoction by the adjacent liver. Thus much 
<A NAME="146"></A>as concerns the omentum.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="147"></A><B>Part 4</B>

<A NAME="148"></A><BR><BR>The so-called mesentery is also a membrane; and extends continuously 
<A NAME="149"></A>from the long stretch of intestine to the great vessel and the aorta. In 
<A NAME="150"></A>it are numerous and close-packed vessels, which run from the intestines 
<A NAME="151"></A>to the great vessel and to the aorta. The formation of this membrane we 
<A NAME="152"></A>shall find to be the result of necessity, as is that of the other [similar] 
<A NAME="153"></A>parts. What, however, is the final cause of its existence in sanguineous 
<A NAME="154"></A>animals is manifest on reflection. For it is necessary that animals shall 
<A NAME="155"></A>get nutriment from without; and, again, that this shall be converted into 
<A NAME="156"></A>the ultimate nutriment, which is then distributed as sustenance to the 
<A NAME="157"></A>various parts; this ultimate nutriment being, in sanguineous animals, what 
<A NAME="158"></A>we call blood, and having, in bloodless animals, no definite name. This 
<A NAME="159"></A>being so, there must be channels through which the nutriment shall pass, 
<A NAME="160"></A>as it were through roots, from the stomach into the blood-vessels. Now 
<A NAME="161"></A>the roots of plants are in the ground; for thence their nutriment is derived. 
<A NAME="162"></A>But in animals the stomach and intestines represent the ground from which 
<A NAME="163"></A>the nutriment is to be taken. The mesentery, then, is an organ to contain 
<A NAME="164"></A>the roots; and these roots are the vessels that traverse it. This then 
<A NAME="165"></A>is the final cause of its existence. But how it absorbs nutriment, and 
<A NAME="166"></A>how that portion of the food which enters into the vessels is distributed 
<A NAME="167"></A>by them to the various parts of the body, are questions which will be considered 
<A NAME="168"></A>when we come to deal with the generation and nutrition of 
<A NAME="169"></A>animals.
<A NAME="170"></A><BR><BR>The constitution of sanguineous animals, so far as the parts as 
<A NAME="171"></A>yet mentioned are concerned, and the reasons for such constitution, have 
<A NAME="172"></A>now been set forth. In natural sequence we should next go on to the organs 
<A NAME="173"></A>of generation, as yet undescribed, on which depend the distinctions of 
<A NAME="174"></A>male and female. But, inasmuch as we shall have to deal specially with 
<A NAME="175"></A>generation hereafter, it will be more convenient to defer the consideration 
<A NAME="176"></A>of these parts to that occasion.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="177"></A><B>Part 5</B>

<A NAME="178"></A><BR><BR>Very different from the animals we have as yet considered are the 
<A NAME="179"></A>Cephalopoda and the Crustacea. For these have absolutely no viscera whatsoever; 
<A NAME="180"></A>as is indeed the case with all bloodless animals, in which are included 
<A NAME="181"></A>two other genera, namely the Testacea and the Insects. For in none of them 
<A NAME="182"></A>does the material out of which viscera are formed exist. None of them, 
<A NAME="183"></A>that is, have blood. The cause of this lies in their essential constitution. 
<A NAME="184"></A>For the presence of blood in some animals, its absence from others, must 
<A NAME="185"></A>be included in the conception which determines their respective essences. 
<A NAME="186"></A>Moreover, in the animals we are now considering, none of those final causes 
<A NAME="187"></A>will be found to exist which in sanguineous animals determine the presence 
<A NAME="188"></A>of viscera. For they have no blood vessels nor urinary bladder, nor do 
<A NAME="189"></A>they breathe; the only part that it is necessary for them to have being 
<A NAME="190"></A>that which is analogous to a heart. For in all animals there must be some 
<A NAME="191"></A>central and commanding part of the body, to lodge the sensory portion of 
<A NAME="192"></A>the soul and the source of life. The organs of nutrition are also of necessity 
<A NAME="193"></A>present in them all. They differ, however, in character because of differences 
<A NAME="194"></A>of the habitats in which they get their subsistence.
<A NAME="195"></A><BR><BR>In the Cephalopoda there are two teeth, enclosing what is called 
<A NAME="196"></A>the mouth; and inside this mouth is a flesh-like substance which represents 
<A NAME="197"></A>a tongue and serves for the discrimination of pleasant and unpleasant food. 
<A NAME="198"></A>The Crustacea have teeth corresponding to those of the Cephalopoda, namely 
<A NAME="199"></A>their anterior teeth, and also have the fleshy representative of a tongue. 
<A NAME="200"></A>This latter part is found, moreover, in all Testacea, and serves, as in 
<A NAME="201"></A>sanguineous animals, for gustatory sensations. Similarly provided also 
<A NAME="202"></A>are the Insects. For some of these, such as the Bees and the Flies, have, 
<A NAME="203"></A>as already described, their proboscis protruding from the mouth; while 
<A NAME="204"></A>those others that have no such instrument in front have a part which acts 
<A NAME="205"></A>as a tongue inside the mouth. Such, for instance, is the case in the Ants 
<A NAME="206"></A>and the like. As for teeth, some insects have them, the Bees and the Ants 
<A NAME="207"></A>for instance, though in a somewhat modified form, while others that live 
<A NAME="208"></A>on fluid nutriment are without them. For in many insects the teeth are 
<A NAME="209"></A>not meant to deal with the food, but to serve as weapons.
<A NAME="210"></A><BR><BR>In some Testacea, as was said in the first treatise, the organ 
<A NAME="211"></A>which is called the tongue is of considerable strength; and in the Cochli 
<A NAME="212"></A>(Sea-snails) there are also two teeth, just as in the Crustacea. The mouth 
<A NAME="213"></A>in the Cephalopoda is succeeded by a long gullet. This leads to a crop, 
<A NAME="214"></A>like that of a bird, and directly continuous with this is the stomach, 
<A NAME="215"></A>from which a gut runs without windings to the vent. The Sepias and the 
<A NAME="216"></A>Poulps resemble each other completely, so far as regards the shape and 
<A NAME="217"></A>consistency of these parts. But not so the Teuthides (Calamaries). Here, 
<A NAME="218"></A>as in the other groups there are the two stomach-like receptacles; but 
<A NAME="219"></A>the first of these cavities has less resemblance to a crop, and in neither 
<A NAME="220"></A>is the form [or the consistency] the same as in the other kinds, the whole 
<A NAME="221"></A>body indeed being made of a softer kind of flesh.
<A NAME="222"></A><BR><BR>The object of this arrangement of the parts in question is the 
<A NAME="223"></A>same in the Cephalopoda as in Birds; for these also are all unable to masticate 
<A NAME="224"></A>their food; and therefore it is that a crop precedes their 
<A NAME="225"></A>stomach.
<A NAME="226"></A><BR><BR>For purposes of defence, and to enable them to escape from their 
<A NAME="227"></A>foes, the Cephalopoda have what is called their ink. This is contained 
<A NAME="228"></A>in a membranous pouch, which is attached to the body and provided with 
<A NAME="229"></A>a terminal outlet just at the point where what is termed the funnel gives 
<A NAME="230"></A>issue to the residua of the stomach. This funnel is placed on the ventral 
<A NAME="231"></A>surface of the animal. All Cephalopoda alike have this characteristic ink, 
<A NAME="232"></A>but chief of all the Sepia, where it is more abundant than in the rest. 
<A NAME="233"></A>When the animal is disturbed and frightened it uses this ink to make the 
<A NAME="234"></A>surrounding water black and turbid, and so, as it were, puts a shield in 
<A NAME="235"></A>front of its body.
<A NAME="236"></A><BR><BR>In the Calamaries and the Poulps the ink-bag is placed in the upper 
<A NAME="237"></A>part of the body, in close proximity to the mytis, whereas in the Sepia 
<A NAME="238"></A>it is lower down, against the stomach. For the Sepia has a more plentiful 
<A NAME="239"></A>supply of ink than the rest, inasmuch as it makes more use of it. The reasons 
<A NAME="240"></A>for this are, firstly, that it lives near the shore, and, secondly, that 
<A NAME="241"></A>it has no other means of protection; whereas the Poulp has its long twining 
<A NAME="242"></A>feet to use in its defence, and is, moreover, endowed with the power of 
<A NAME="243"></A>changing colour. This changing of colour, like the discharge of ink, occurs 
<A NAME="244"></A>as the result of fright. As to the Calamary, it lives far out at sea, being 
<A NAME="245"></A>the only one of the Cephalopoda that does so; and this gives it protection. 
<A NAME="246"></A>These then are the reasons why the ink is more abundant in the Sepia than 
<A NAME="247"></A>in the Calamary, and this greater abundance explains the lower position; 
<A NAME="248"></A>for it allows the ink to be ejected with ease even from a distance. The 
<A NAME="249"></A>ink itself is of an earthy character, in this resembling the white deposit 
<A NAME="250"></A>on the surface of a bird's excrement and the explanation in both cases 
<A NAME="251"></A>is the same, namely, the absence of a urinary bladder. For, in default 
<A NAME="252"></A>of this, it is the ink that serves for the excretion of the earthiest matter. 
<A NAME="253"></A>And this is more especially the case in the Sepia, because there is a greater 
<A NAME="254"></A>proportion of earth in its composition than in that of the other Cephalopoda. 
<A NAME="255"></A>The earthy character of its bone is a clear indication of this. For in 
<A NAME="256"></A>the Poulp there is no bone at all, and in the Calamary it is thin and cartilaginous. 
<A NAME="257"></A>Why this bone should be present in some Cephalopoda, and wanting in others, 
<A NAME="258"></A>and how its character varies in those that have it, has now been set 
<A NAME="259"></A>forth.
<A NAME="260"></A><BR><BR>These animals, having no blood, are in consequence cold and of 
<A NAME="261"></A>a timid character. Now, in some animals, fear causes a disturbance of the 
<A NAME="262"></A>bowels, and, in others, a flow of urine from the bladder. Similarly in 
<A NAME="263"></A>these it produces a discharge of ink, and, though the ejection of this 
<A NAME="264"></A>ink in fright, like that of the urine, is the result of necessity, and, 
<A NAME="265"></A>though it is of excremental character, yet it is used by nature for a purpose, 
<A NAME="266"></A>namely, the protection and safety of the animal that excretes 
<A NAME="267"></A>it.
<A NAME="268"></A><BR><BR>The Crustacea also, both the Caraboid forms and the Crabs, are 
<A NAME="269"></A>provided with teeth, namely their two anterior teeth; and between these 
<A NAME="270"></A>they also present the tongue-like piece of flesh, as has indeed been already 
<A NAME="271"></A>mentioned. Directly after their mouth comes a gullet, which, if we compare 
<A NAME="272"></A>relative sizes, is but small in proportion to the body: and then a stomach, 
<A NAME="273"></A>which in the Carabi and some of the Crabs is furnished with a second set 
<A NAME="274"></A>of teeth, the anterior teeth being insufficient for adequate mastication. 
<A NAME="275"></A>From the stomach a uniform gut runs in a direct line to the excremental 
<A NAME="276"></A>vent.
<A NAME="277"></A><BR><BR>The parts described are to be found also in all the various Testacea. 
<A NAME="278"></A>The degree of distinctness, however, with which they are formed varies 
<A NAME="279"></A>in the different kinds, and the larger the size of the animal the more 
<A NAME="280"></A>easily distinguishable are all these parts severally. In the Sea-snails, 
<A NAME="281"></A>for example, we find teeth, hard and sharp, as before mentioned, and between 
<A NAME="282"></A>them the flesh-like substance, just as in the Crustacea and Cephalopoda, 
<A NAME="283"></A>and again the proboscis, which, as has been stated, is something between 
<A NAME="284"></A>a sting and a tongue. Directly after the mouth comes a kind of bird-like 
<A NAME="285"></A>crop, then a gullet, succeeded by a stomach, in which is the mecon, as 
<A NAME="286"></A>it is styled; and continuous with this mecon is an intestine, starting 
<A NAME="287"></A>directly from it. It is this residual substance which appears in all the 
<A NAME="288"></A>Testacea to form the most palatable morsel. Purpuras and Whelks, and all 
<A NAME="289"></A>other Testacea that have turbinate shells, in structure resemble the Sea-snail. 
<A NAME="290"></A>The genera and species of Testacea are very numerous. For there are those 
<A NAME="291"></A>with turbinate shells, of which some have just been mentioned; and, besides 
<A NAME="292"></A>these, there are bivalves and univalves. Those with turbinate shells may, 
<A NAME="293"></A>indeed, after a certain fashion be said to resemble bivalves. For they 
<A NAME="294"></A>all from their very birth have an operculum to protect that part of their 
<A NAME="295"></A>body which is exposed to view. This is the case with the Purpuras, with 
<A NAME="296"></A>Whelks, with the Nerites, and the like. Were it not for this, the part 
<A NAME="297"></A>which is undefended by the shell would be very liable to injury by collision 
<A NAME="298"></A>with external objects. The univalves also are not without protection. For 
<A NAME="299"></A>on their dorsal surface they have a shell, and by the under surface they 
<A NAME="300"></A>attach themselves to the rocks, and so after a manner become bivalved, 
<A NAME="301"></A>the rock representing the second valve. Of these the animals known as Limpets 
<A NAME="302"></A>are an example. The bivalves, scallops and mussels, for instance, are protected 
<A NAME="303"></A>by the power they have of closing their valves; and the Turbinata by the 
<A NAME="304"></A>operculum just mentioned, which transforms them, as it were, crom univalves 
<A NAME="305"></A>into bivalves. But of all there is none so perfectly protected as the sea-urchin. 
<A NAME="306"></A>For here there is a globular shell which encloses the body completely, 
<A NAME="307"></A>and which is, moreover, set with sharp spines. This peculiarity distinguishes 
<A NAME="308"></A>the sea-urchin from all other Testacea, as has already been 
<A NAME="309"></A>mentioned.
<A NAME="310"></A><BR><BR>The structure of the Testacea and of the Crustacea is exactly the 
<A NAME="311"></A>reverse of that of the Cephalopoda. For in the latter the fleshy substance 
<A NAME="312"></A>is on the outside and the earthy substance within, whereas in the former 
<A NAME="313"></A>the soft parts are inside and the hard part without. In the sea-urchin, 
<A NAME="314"></A>however, there is no fleshy part whatsoever.
<A NAME="315"></A><BR><BR>All the Testacea then, those that have not been mentioned as well 
<A NAME="316"></A>as those that have, agree as stated in possessing a mouth with the tongue-like 
<A NAME="317"></A>body, a stomach, and a vent for excrement, but they differ from each other 
<A NAME="318"></A>in the positions and proportions of these parts. The details, however, 
<A NAME="319"></A>of these differences must be looked for in the Researches concerning Animals 
<A NAME="320"></A>and the treatises on Anatomy. For while there are some points which can 
<A NAME="321"></A>be made clear by verbal description, there are others which are more suited 
<A NAME="322"></A>for ocular demonstration.
<A NAME="323"></A><BR><BR>Peculiar among the Testacea are the sea-urchins and the animals 
<A NAME="324"></A>known as Tethya (Ascidians). The sea-urchins have five teeth, and in the 
<A NAME="325"></A>centre of these the fleshy body which is common to all the animals we have 
<A NAME="326"></A>been discussing. Immediately after this comes a gullet, and then the stomach, 
<A NAME="327"></A>divided into a number of separate compartments, which look like so many 
<A NAME="328"></A>distinct stomachs; for the cavities are separate and all contain abundant 
<A NAME="329"></A>residual matter. They are all, however, connected with one and the same 
<A NAME="330"></A>oesophagus, and they all end in one and the same excremental vent. There 
<A NAME="331"></A>is nothing besides the stomach of a fleshy character, as has already been 
<A NAME="332"></A>stated. All that can be seen are the so-called ova, of which there are 
<A NAME="333"></A>several, contained each in a separate membrane, and certain black bodies 
<A NAME="334"></A>which have no name, and which, beginning at the animal's mouth, are scattered 
<A NAME="335"></A>round its body here and there promiscuously. These sea-urchins are not 
<A NAME="336"></A>all of one species, but there are several different kinds, and in all of 
<A NAME="337"></A>them the parts mentioned are to be found. It is not, however, in every 
<A NAME="338"></A>kind that the so-called ova are edible. Neither do these attain to any 
<A NAME="339"></A>size in any other species than that with which we are all familiar. A similar 
<A NAME="340"></A>distinction may be made generally in the case of all Testacea. For there 
<A NAME="341"></A>is a great difference in the edible qualities of the flesh of different 
<A NAME="342"></A>kinds; and in some, moreover, the residual substance known as the mecon 
<A NAME="343"></A>is good for food, while in others it is uneatable. This mecon in the turbinated 
<A NAME="344"></A>genera is lodged in the spiral part of the shell, while in univalves, such 
<A NAME="345"></A>as limpets, it occupies the fundus, and in bivalves is placed near the 
<A NAME="346"></A>hinge, the so-called ovum lying on the right; while on the opposite side 
<A NAME="347"></A>is the vent. The former is incorrectly termed ovum, for it merely corresponds 
<A NAME="348"></A>to what in well-fed sanguineous animals is fat; and thus it is that it 
<A NAME="349"></A>makes its appearance in Testacea at those seasons of the year when they 
<A NAME="350"></A>are in good condition, namely, spring and autumn. For no Testacea can abide 
<A NAME="351"></A>extremes of temperature, and they are therefore in evil plight in seasons 
<A NAME="352"></A>of great cold or heat. This is clearly shown by what occurs in the case 
<A NAME="353"></A>of the sea-urchins. For though the ova are to be found in these animals 
<A NAME="354"></A>even directly they are born, yet they acquire a greater size than usual 
<A NAME="355"></A>at the time of full moon; not, as some think, because sea-urchins eat more 
<A NAME="356"></A>at that season, but because the nights are then warmer, owing to the moonlight. 
<A NAME="357"></A>For these creatures are bloodless, and so are unable to stand cold and 
<A NAME="358"></A>require warmth. Therefore it is that they are found in better condition 
<A NAME="359"></A>in summer than at any other season; and this all over the world excepting 
<A NAME="360"></A>in the Pyrrhean tidal strait. There the sea-urchins flourish as well in 
<A NAME="361"></A>winter as in summer. But the reason for this is that they have a greater 
<A NAME="362"></A>abundance of food in the winter, because the fish desert the strait at 
<A NAME="363"></A>that season.
<A NAME="364"></A><BR><BR>The number of the ova is the same in all sea-urchins, and is an 
<A NAME="365"></A>odd one. For there are five ova, just as there are also five teeth and 
<A NAME="366"></A>five stomachs; and the explanation of this is to be found in the fact that 
<A NAME="367"></A>the so-called ova are not really ova, but merely, as was said before, the 
<A NAME="368"></A>result of the animal's well-fed condition. Oysters also have a so-called 
<A NAME="369"></A>ovum, corresponding in character to that of the sea-urchins, but existing 
<A NAME="370"></A>only on one side of their body. Now inasmuch as the sea-urchin is of a 
<A NAME="371"></A>spherical form, and not merely a single disk like the oyster, and in virtue 
<A NAME="372"></A>of its spherical shape is the same from whatever side it be examined, its 
<A NAME="373"></A>ovum must necessarily be of a corresponding symmetry. For the spherical 
<A NAME="374"></A>shape has not the asymmetry of the disk-shaped body of the oysters. For 
<A NAME="375"></A>in all these animals the head is central, but in the sea-urchin the so-called 
<A NAME="376"></A>ovum is above [and symmetrical, while in the oyster it is only one side]. 
<A NAME="377"></A>Now the necessary symmetry would be observed were the ovum to form a continuous 
<A NAME="378"></A>ring. But this may not be. For it would be in opposition to what prevails 
<A NAME="379"></A>in the whole tribe of Testacea; for in all the ovum is discontinuous, and 
<A NAME="380"></A>in all excepting the sea-urchins asymmetrical, being placed only on one 
<A NAME="381"></A>side of the body. Owing then to this necessary discontinuity of the ovum, 
<A NAME="382"></A>which belongs to the sea-urchin as a member of the class, and owing to 
<A NAME="383"></A>the spherical shape of its body, which is its individual peculiarity, this 
<A NAME="384"></A>animal cannot possibly have an even number of ova. For were they an even 
<A NAME="385"></A>number, they would have to be arranged exactly opposite to each other, 
<A NAME="386"></A>in pairs, so as to keep the necessary symmetry; one ovum of each pair being 
<A NAME="387"></A>placed at one end, the other ovum at the other end of a transverse diameter. 
<A NAME="388"></A>This again would violate the universal provision in Testacea. For both 
<A NAME="389"></A>in the oysters and in the scallops we find the ovum only on one side of 
<A NAME="390"></A>the circumference. The number then of the ova must be uneven, three for 
<A NAME="391"></A>instance, or five. But if there were only three they would be much too 
<A NAME="392"></A>far apart; while, if there were more than five, they would come to form 
<A NAME="393"></A>a continuous mass. The former arrangement would be disadvantageous to the 
<A NAME="394"></A>animal, the latter an impossibility. There can therefore be neither more 
<A NAME="395"></A>nor less than five. For the same reason the stomach is divided into five 
<A NAME="396"></A>parts, and there is a corresponding number of teeth. For seeing that the 
<A NAME="397"></A>ova represent each of them a kind of body for the animal, their disposition 
<A NAME="398"></A>must conform to that of the stomach, seeing that it is from this that they 
<A NAME="399"></A>derive the material for their growth. Now if there were only one stomach, 
<A NAME="400"></A>either the ova would be too far off from it, or it would be so big as to 
<A NAME="401"></A>fill up the whole cavity, and the sea-urchin would have great difficulty 
<A NAME="402"></A>in moving about and finding due nourishment for its repletion. As then 
<A NAME="403"></A>there are five intervals between the five ova, so are there of necessity 
<A NAME="404"></A>five divisions of the stomach, one for each interval. So also, and on like 
<A NAME="405"></A>grounds, there are five teeth. For nature is thus enabled to allot to each 
<A NAME="406"></A>stomachal compartment and ovum its separate and similar tooth. These, then, 
<A NAME="407"></A>are the reasons why the number of ova in the sea-urchin is an odd one, 
<A NAME="408"></A>and why that odd number is five. In some sea-urchins the ova are excessively 
<A NAME="409"></A>small, in others of considerable size, the explanation being that the latter 
<A NAME="410"></A>are of a warmer constitution, and so are able to concoct their food more 
<A NAME="411"></A>thoroughly; while in the former concoction is less perfect, so that the 
<A NAME="412"></A>stomach is found full of residual matter, while the ova are small and uneatable. 
<A NAME="413"></A>Those of a warmer constitution are, moreover, in virtue of their warmth 
<A NAME="414"></A>more given to motion, so that they make expeditions in search of food, 
<A NAME="415"></A>instead of remaining stationary like the rest. As evidence of this, it 
<A NAME="416"></A>will be found that they always have something or other sticking to their 
<A NAME="417"></A>spines, as though they moved much about; for they use their spines as 
<A NAME="418"></A>feet.
<A NAME="419"></A><BR><BR>The Ascidians differ but slightly from plants, and yet have more 
<A NAME="420"></A>of an animal nature than the sponges, which are virtually plants and nothing 
<A NAME="421"></A>more. For nature passes from lifeless objects to animals in such unbroken 
<A NAME="422"></A>sequence, interposing between them beings which live and yet are not animals, 
<A NAME="423"></A>that scarcely any difference seems to exist between two neighbouring groups 
<A NAME="424"></A>owing to their close proximity.
<A NAME="425"></A><BR><BR>A sponge, then, as already said, in these respects completely resembles 
<A NAME="426"></A>a plant, that throughout its life it is attached to a rock, and that when 
<A NAME="427"></A>separated from this it dies. Slightly different from the sponges are the 
<A NAME="428"></A>so-called Holothurias and the sea-lungs, as also sundry other sea-animals 
<A NAME="429"></A>that resemble them. For these are free and unattached. Yet they have no 
<A NAME="430"></A>feeling, and their life is simply that of a plant separated from the ground. 
<A NAME="431"></A>For even among land-plants there are some that are independent of the soil, 
<A NAME="432"></A>and that spring up and grow, either upon other plants, or even entirely 
<A NAME="433"></A>free. Such, for example, is the plant which is found on Parnassus, and 
<A NAME="434"></A>which some call the Epipetrum. This you may hang up on a peg and it will 
<A NAME="435"></A>yet live for a considerable time. Sometimes it is a matter of doubt whether 
<A NAME="436"></A>a given organism should be classed with plants or with animals. The Ascidians, 
<A NAME="437"></A>for instance, and the like so far resemble plants as that they never live 
<A NAME="438"></A>free and unattached, but, on the other hand, inasmuch as they have a certain 
<A NAME="439"></A>flesh-like substance, they must be supposed to possess some degree of 
<A NAME="440"></A>sensibility.
<A NAME="441"></A><BR><BR>An Ascidian has a body divided by a single septum and with two 
<A NAME="442"></A>orifices, one where it takes in the fluid matter that ministers to its 
<A NAME="443"></A>nutrition, the other where it discharges the surplus of unused juice, for 
<A NAME="444"></A>it has no visible residual substance, such as have the other Testacea. 
<A NAME="445"></A>This is itself a very strong justification for considering an Ascidian, 
<A NAME="446"></A>and anything else there may be among animals that resembles it, to be of 
<A NAME="447"></A>a vegetable character; for plants also never have any residuum. Across 
<A NAME="448"></A>the middle of the body of these Ascidians there runs a thin transverse 
<A NAME="449"></A>partition, and here it is that we may reasonably suppose the part on which 
<A NAME="450"></A>life depends to be situated.
<A NAME="451"></A><BR><BR>The Acalephae, or Sea-nettles, as they are variously called, are 
<A NAME="452"></A>not Testacea at all, but lie outside the recognized groups. Their constitution, 
<A NAME="453"></A>like that of the Ascidians, approximates them on one side to plants, on 
<A NAME="454"></A>the other to animals. For seeing that some of them can detach themselves 
<A NAME="455"></A>and can fasten upon their food, and that they are sensible of objects which 
<A NAME="456"></A>come in contact with them, they must be considered to have an animal nature. 
<A NAME="457"></A>The like conclusion follows from their using the asperity of their bodies 
<A NAME="458"></A>as a protection against their enemies. But, on the other hand, they are 
<A NAME="459"></A>closely allied to plants, firstly by the imperfection of their structure, 
<A NAME="460"></A>secondly by their being able to attach themselves to the rocks, which they 
<A NAME="461"></A>do with great rapidity, and lastly by their having no visible residuum 
<A NAME="462"></A>notwithstanding that they possess a mouth.
<A NAME="463"></A><BR><BR>Very similar again to the Acalephae are the Starfishes. For these 
<A NAME="464"></A>also fasten on their prey, and suck out its juices, and thus destroy a 
<A NAME="465"></A>vast number of oysters. At the same time they present a certain resemblance 
<A NAME="466"></A>to such of the animals we have described as the Cephalopoda and Crustacea, 
<A NAME="467"></A>inasmuch as they are free and unattached. The same may also be said of 
<A NAME="468"></A>the Testacea.
<A NAME="469"></A><BR><BR>Such, then, is the structure of the parts that minister to nutrition 
<A NAME="470"></A>and which every animal must possess. But besides these organs it is quite 
<A NAME="471"></A>plain that in every animal there must be some part or other which shall 
<A NAME="472"></A>be analogous to what in sanguineous animals is the presiding seat of sensation. 
<A NAME="473"></A>Whether an animal has or has not blood, it cannot possibly be without this. 
<A NAME="474"></A>In the Cephalopoda this part consists of a fluid substance contained in 
<A NAME="475"></A>a membrane, through which runs the gullet on its way to the stomach. It 
<A NAME="476"></A>is attached to the body rather towards its dorsal surface, and by some 
<A NAME="477"></A>is called the mytis. Just such another organ is found also in the Crustacea 
<A NAME="478"></A>and there too is known by the same name. This part is at once fluid and 
<A NAME="479"></A>corporeal and, as before said, is traversed by the gullet. For had the 
<A NAME="480"></A>gullet been placed between the mytis and the dorsal surface of the animal, 
<A NAME="481"></A>the hardness of the back would have interfered with its due dilatation 
<A NAME="482"></A>in the act of deglutition. On the outer surface of the mytis runs the intestine; 
<A NAME="483"></A>and in contact with this latter is placed the ink-bag, so that it may be 
<A NAME="484"></A>removed as far as possible from the mouth and its obnoxious fluid be kept 
<A NAME="485"></A>at a distance from the nobler and sovereign part. The position of the mytis 
<A NAME="486"></A>shows that it corresponds to the heart of sanguineous animals; for it occupies 
<A NAME="487"></A>the self-same place. The same is shown by the sweetness of its fluid, which 
<A NAME="488"></A>has the character of concocted matter and resembles 
<A NAME="489"></A>blood.
<A NAME="490"></A><BR><BR>In the Testacea the presiding seat of sensation is in a corresponding 
<A NAME="491"></A>position, but is less easily made out. It should, however, always be looked 
<A NAME="492"></A>for in some midway position; namely, in such Testacea as are stationary, 
<A NAME="493"></A>midway between the part by which food is taken in and the channel through 
<A NAME="494"></A>which either the excrement or the spermatic fluid is voided, and, in those 
<A NAME="495"></A>species which are capable of locomotion, invariably midway between the 
<A NAME="496"></A>right and left sides.
<A NAME="497"></A><BR><BR>In Insects this organ, which is the seat of sensation, lies, as 
<A NAME="498"></A>was stated in the first treatise, between the head and the cavity which 
<A NAME="499"></A>contains the stomach. In most of them it consists of a single part; but 
<A NAME="500"></A>in others, for instance in such as have long bodies and resemble the Juli 
<A NAME="501"></A>(Millipedes), it is made up of several parts, so that such insects continue 
<A NAME="502"></A>to live after they have been cut in pieces. For the aim of nature is to 
<A NAME="503"></A>give to each animal only one such dominant part; and when she is unable 
<A NAME="504"></A>to carry out this intention she causes the parts, though potentially many, 
<A NAME="505"></A>to work together actually as one. This is much more clearly marked in some 
<A NAME="506"></A>insects than in others.
<A NAME="507"></A><BR><BR>The parts concerned in nutrition are not alike in all insects, 
<A NAME="508"></A>but show considerable diversity. Thus some have what is called a sting 
<A NAME="509"></A>in the mouth, which is a kind of compound instrument that combines in itself 
<A NAME="510"></A>the character of a tongue and of lips. In others that have no such instrument 
<A NAME="511"></A>in front there is a part inside the mouth that answers the same sensory 
<A NAME="512"></A>purposes. Immediately after the mouth comes the intestine, which is never 
<A NAME="513"></A>wanting in any insect. This runs in a straight line and without further 
<A NAME="514"></A>complication to the vent; occasionally, however, it has a spiral coil. 
<A NAME="515"></A>There are, moreover, some insects in which a stomach succeeds to the mouth, 
<A NAME="516"></A>and is itself succeeded by a convoluted intestine, so that the larger and 
<A NAME="517"></A>more voracious insects may be enabled to take in a more abundant supply 
<A NAME="518"></A>of food. More curious than any are the Cicadae. For here the mouth and 
<A NAME="519"></A>the tongue are united so as to form a single part, through which, as through 
<A NAME="520"></A>a root, the insect sucks up the fluids on which it lives. Insects are always 
<A NAME="521"></A>small eaters, not so much because of their diminutive size as because of 
<A NAME="522"></A>their cold temperament. For it is heat which requires sustenance; just 
<A NAME="523"></A>as it is heat which speedily concocts it. But cold requires no sustenance. 
<A NAME="524"></A>In no insects is this so conspicuous as in these Cicadae. For they find 
<A NAME="525"></A>enough to live on in the moisture which is deposited from the air. So also 
<A NAME="526"></A>do the Ephemera that are found about the Black sea. But while these latter 
<A NAME="527"></A>only live for a single day, the Cicadae subsist on such food for several 
<A NAME="528"></A>days, though still not many.
<A NAME="529"></A><BR><BR>We have now done with the internal parts of animals, and must therefore 
<A NAME="530"></A>return to the consideration of the external parts which have not yet been 
<A NAME="531"></A>described. It will be better to change our order of exposition and begin 
<A NAME="532"></A>with the animals we have just been describing, so that proceeding from 
<A NAME="533"></A>these, which require less discussion, our account may have more time to 
<A NAME="534"></A>spend on the perfect kinds of animals, those namely that have 
<A NAME="535"></A>blood.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="536"></A><B>Part 6</B>

<A NAME="537"></A><BR><BR>We will begin with Insects. These animals, though they present 
<A NAME="538"></A>no great multiplicity of parts, are not without diversities when compared 
<A NAME="539"></A>with each other. They are all manyfooted; the object of this being to compensate 
<A NAME="540"></A>their natural slowness and frigidity, and give greater activity to their 
<A NAME="541"></A>motions. Accordingly we find that those which, as the (Millipedes), have 
<A NAME="542"></A>long bodies, and are therefore the most liable to refrigeration, have also 
<A NAME="543"></A>the greatest number of feet. Again, the body in these animals is insected-the 
<A NAME="544"></A>reason for this being that they have not got one vital centre but many-and 
<A NAME="545"></A>the number of their feet corresponds to that of the 
<A NAME="546"></A>insections.
<A NAME="547"></A><BR><BR>Should the feet fall short of this, their deficiency is compensated 
<A NAME="548"></A>by the power of flight. Of such flying insects some live a wandering life, 
<A NAME="549"></A>and are forced to make long expeditions in search of food. These have a 
<A NAME="550"></A>body of light weight, and four feathers, two on either side, to support 
<A NAME="551"></A>it. Such are bees and the insects akin to them. When, however, such insects 
<A NAME="552"></A>are of very small bulk, their feathers are reduced to two, as is the case 
<A NAME="553"></A>with flies. Insects with heavy bodies and of stationary habits, though 
<A NAME="554"></A>not polypterous in the same way as bees, yet have sheaths to their feathers 
<A NAME="555"></A>to maintain their efficiency. Such are the Melolonthae and the like. For 
<A NAME="556"></A>their stationary habits expose their feathers to much greater risks than 
<A NAME="557"></A>are run by those of insects that are more constantly in flight, and on 
<A NAME="558"></A>this account they are provided with this protecting shield. The feather 
<A NAME="559"></A>of an insect has neither barbs nor shaft. For, though it is called a feather, 
<A NAME="560"></A>it is no feather at all, but merely a skin-like membrane that, owing to 
<A NAME="561"></A>its dryness, necessarily becomes detached from the surface of the body, 
<A NAME="562"></A>as the fleshy substance grows cold.
<A NAME="563"></A><BR><BR>These animals then have their bodies insected, not only for the 
<A NAME="564"></A>reasons already assigned, but also to enable them to curl round in such 
<A NAME="565"></A>a manner as may protect them from injury; for such insects as have long 
<A NAME="566"></A>bodies can roll themselves up, which would be impossible were it not for 
<A NAME="567"></A>the insections; and those that cannot do this can yet draw their segments 
<A NAME="568"></A>up into the insected spaces, and so increase the hardness of their bodies. 
<A NAME="569"></A>This can be felt quite plainly by putting the finger on one of the insects, 
<A NAME="570"></A>for instance, known as Canthari. The touch frightens the insect, and it 
<A NAME="571"></A>remains motionless, while its body becomes hard. The division of the body 
<A NAME="572"></A>into segments is also a necessary result of there being several supreme 
<A NAME="573"></A>organs in place of one; and this again is a part of the essential constitution 
<A NAME="574"></A>of insects, and is a character which approximates them to plants. For as 
<A NAME="575"></A>plants, though cut into pieces, can still live, so also can insects. There 
<A NAME="576"></A>is, however, this difference between the two cases, that the portions of 
<A NAME="577"></A>the divided insect live only for a limited time, whereas the portions of 
<A NAME="578"></A>the plant live on and attain the perfect form of the whole, so that from 
<A NAME="579"></A>one single plant you may obtain two or more.
<A NAME="580"></A><BR><BR>Some insects are also provided with another means of protection 
<A NAME="581"></A>against their enemies, namely a sting. In some this is in front, connected 
<A NAME="582"></A>with the tongue, in others behind at the posterior end. For just as the 
<A NAME="583"></A>organ of smell in elephants answers several uses, serving alike as a weapon 
<A NAME="584"></A>and for purposes of nutrition, so does also the sting, when placed in connexion 
<A NAME="585"></A>with the tongue, as in some insects, answer more than one end. For it is 
<A NAME="586"></A>the instrument through which they derive their sensations of food, as well 
<A NAME="587"></A>as that with which they suck it up and bring it to the mouth. Such of these 
<A NAME="588"></A>insects as have no anterior sting are provided with teeth, which serve 
<A NAME="589"></A>in some of them for biting the food, and in others for its prehension and 
<A NAME="590"></A>conveyance to the mouth. Such are their uses, for instance, in ants and 
<A NAME="591"></A>all the various kinds of bees. As for the insects that have a sting behind, 
<A NAME="592"></A>this weapon is given them because they are of a fierce disposition. In 
<A NAME="593"></A>some of them the sting is lodged inside the body, in bees, for example, 
<A NAME="594"></A>and wasps. For these insects are made for flight, and were their sting 
<A NAME="595"></A>external and of delicate make it would soon get spoiled; and if, on the 
<A NAME="596"></A>other hand, it were of thicker build, as in scorpions, its weight would 
<A NAME="597"></A>be an incumbrance. As for scorpions that live on the ground and have a 
<A NAME="598"></A>tail, their sting must be set upon this, as otherwise it would be of no 
<A NAME="599"></A>use as a weapon. Dipterous insects never have a posterior sting. For the 
<A NAME="600"></A>very reason of their being dipterous is that they are small and weak, and 
<A NAME="601"></A>therefore require no more than two feathers to support their light weight; 
<A NAME="602"></A>and the same reason which reduces their feathers to two causes their sting 
<A NAME="603"></A>to be in front; for their strength is not sufficient to allow them to strike 
<A NAME="604"></A>efficiently with the hinder part of the body. Polypterous insects, on the 
<A NAME="605"></A>other hand, are of greater bulk-indeed it is this which causes them to 
<A NAME="606"></A>have so many feathers; and their greater size makes them stronger in their 
<A NAME="607"></A>hinder parts. The sting of such insects is therefore placed behind. Now 
<A NAME="608"></A>it is better, when possible, that one and the same instrument shall not 
<A NAME="609"></A>be made to serve several dissimilar uses; but that there shall be one organ 
<A NAME="610"></A>to serve as a weapon, which can then be very sharp, and a distinct one 
<A NAME="611"></A>to serve as a tongue, which can then be of spongy texture and fit to absorb 
<A NAME="612"></A>nutriment. Whenever, therefore, nature is able to provide two separate 
<A NAME="613"></A>instruments for two separate uses, without the one hampering the other, 
<A NAME="614"></A>she does so, instead of acting like a coppersmith who for cheapness makes 
<A NAME="615"></A>a spit and lampholder in one. It is only when this is impossible that she 
<A NAME="616"></A>uses one organ for several functions.
<A NAME="617"></A><BR><BR>The anterior legs are in some cases longer than the others, that 
<A NAME="618"></A>they may serve to wipe away any foreign matter that may lodge on the insect's 
<A NAME="619"></A>eyes and obstruct its sight, which already is not very distinct owing to 
<A NAME="620"></A>the eyes being made of a hard substance. Flies and bees and the like may 
<A NAME="621"></A>be constantly seen thus dressing themselves with crossed forelegs. Of the 
<A NAME="622"></A>other legs, the hinder are bigger than the middle pair, both to aid in 
<A NAME="623"></A>running and also that the insect, when it takes flight, may spring more 
<A NAME="624"></A>easily from the ground. This difference is still more marked in such insects 
<A NAME="625"></A>as leap, in locusts for instance, and in the various kinds of fleas. For 
<A NAME="626"></A>these first bend and then extend the legs, and, by doing so, are necessarily 
<A NAME="627"></A>shot up from the ground. It is only the. hind legs of locusts, and not 
<A NAME="628"></A>the front ones, that resemble the steering oars of a ship. For this requires 
<A NAME="629"></A>that the joint shall be deflected inwards, and such is never the case with 
<A NAME="630"></A>the anterior limbs. The whole number of legs, including those used in leaping, 
<A NAME="631"></A>is six in all these insects.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="632"></A><B>Part 7</B>

<A NAME="633"></A><BR><BR>In the Testacea the body consists of but few parts, the reason 
<A NAME="634"></A>being that these animals live a stationary life. For such animals as move 
<A NAME="635"></A>much about must of necessity have more numerous parts than such as remain 
<A NAME="636"></A>quiet; for their activities are many, and the more diversified the movements 
<A NAME="637"></A>the greater the number of organs required to effect them. Some species 
<A NAME="638"></A>of Testacea are absolutely motionless, and others not quite but nearly 
<A NAME="639"></A>so. Nature, however, has provided them with a protection in the hardness 
<A NAME="640"></A>of the shell with which she has invested their body. This shell, as already 
<A NAME="641"></A>has been said, may have one valve, or two valves, or be turbinate. In the 
<A NAME="642"></A>latter case it may be either spiral, as in whelks, or merely globular, 
<A NAME="643"></A>as in sea-urchins. When it has two valves, these may be gaping, as in scallops 
<A NAME="644"></A>and mussels, where the valves are united together on one side only, so 
<A NAME="645"></A>as to open and shut on the other; or they may be united together on both 
<A NAME="646"></A>sides, as in the Solens (razor-fishes). In all cases alike the Testacea 
<A NAME="647"></A>have, like plants, the head downwards. The reason for this is, that they 
<A NAME="648"></A>take in their nourishment from below, just as do plants with their roots. 
<A NAME="649"></A>Thus the under parts come in them to be above, and the upper parts to be 
<A NAME="650"></A>below. The body is enclosed in a membrane, and through this the animal 
<A NAME="651"></A>filters fluid free from salt and absorbs its nutriment. In all there is 
<A NAME="652"></A>a head; but none of the parts, excepting this recipient of food, has any 
<A NAME="653"></A>distinctive name.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="654"></A><B>Part 8</B>

<A NAME="655"></A><BR><BR>All the Crustacea can crawl as well as swim, and accordingly they 
<A NAME="656"></A>are provided with numerous feet. There are four main genera, viz. the Carabi, 
<A NAME="657"></A>as they are called, the Astaci, the Carides, and the Carcini. In each of 
<A NAME="658"></A>these genera, again, there are numerous species, which differ from each 
<A NAME="659"></A>other not only as regards shape, but also very considerably as regards 
<A NAME="660"></A>size. For, while in some species the individuals are large, in others they 
<A NAME="661"></A>are excessively minute. The Carcinoid and Caraboid Crustacea resemble each 
<A NAME="662"></A>other in possessing claws. These claws are not for locomotion, but to serve 
<A NAME="663"></A>in place of hands for seizing and holding objects; and they are therefore 
<A NAME="664"></A>bent in the opposite direction to the feet, being so twisted as to turn 
<A NAME="665"></A>their convexity towards the body, while their feet turn towards it their 
<A NAME="666"></A>concavity. For in this position the claws are best suited for laying hold 
<A NAME="667"></A>of the food and carrying it to the mouth. The distinction between the Carabi 
<A NAME="668"></A>and the Carcini (Crabs) consists in the former having a tail while the 
<A NAME="669"></A>latter have none. For the Carabi swim about and a tail is therefore of 
<A NAME="670"></A>use to them, serving for their propulsion like the blade of an oar. But 
<A NAME="671"></A>it would be of no use to the Crabs; for these animals live habitually close 
<A NAME="672"></A>to the shore, and creep into holes and corners. In such of them as live 
<A NAME="673"></A>out at sea, the feet are much less adapted for locomotion than in the rest, 
<A NAME="674"></A>because they are little given to moving about but depend for protection 
<A NAME="675"></A>on their shell-like covering. The Maiae and the crabs known as Heracleotic 
<A NAME="676"></A>are examples of this; the legs in the former being very thin, in the latter 
<A NAME="677"></A>very short.
<A NAME="678"></A><BR><BR>The very minute crabs that are found among the small fry at the 
<A NAME="679"></A>bottom of the net have their hindermost feet flattened out into the semblance 
<A NAME="680"></A>of fins or oar-blades, so as to help the animal in swimming.
<A NAME="681"></A><BR><BR>The Carides are distinguished from the Carcinoid species by the 
<A NAME="682"></A>presence of a tail; and from the Caraboids by the absence of claws. This 
<A NAME="683"></A>is explained by their large number of feet, on which has been expended 
<A NAME="684"></A>the material for the growth of claws. Their feet again are numerous to 
<A NAME="685"></A>suit their mode of progression, which is mainly by swimming.
<A NAME="686"></A><BR><BR>Of the parts on the ventral surface, those near the head are in 
<A NAME="687"></A>some of these animals formed like gills, for the admission and discharge 
<A NAME="688"></A>of water; while the parts lower down differ in the two sexes. For in the 
<A NAME="689"></A>female Carabi these are more laminar than in the males, and in the female 
<A NAME="690"></A>crabs the flap is furnished with hairier appendages. This gives ampler 
<A NAME="691"></A>space for the disposal of the ova, which the females retain in these parts 
<A NAME="692"></A>instead of letting them go free, as do fishes and all other oviparous animals. 
<A NAME="693"></A>In the Carabi and in the Crabs the right claw is invariably the larger 
<A NAME="694"></A>and the stronger. For it is natural to every animal in active operations 
<A NAME="695"></A>to use the parts on its right side in preference to those on its left; 
<A NAME="696"></A>and nature, in distributing the organs, invariably assigns each, either 
<A NAME="697"></A>exclusively or in a more perfect condition, to such animals as can use 
<A NAME="698"></A>it. So it is with tusks, and teeth, and horns, and spurs, and all such 
<A NAME="699"></A>defensive and offensive weapons.
<A NAME="700"></A><BR><BR>In the Lobsters alone it is a matter of chance which claw is the 
<A NAME="701"></A>larger, and this in either sex. Claws they must have, because they belong 
<A NAME="702"></A>to a genus in which this is a constant character; but they have them in 
<A NAME="703"></A>this indeterminate way, owing to imperfect formation and to their not using 
<A NAME="704"></A>them for their natural purpose, but for locomotion.
<A NAME="705"></A><BR><BR>For a detailed account of the several parts of these animals, of 
<A NAME="706"></A>their position and their differences, those parts being also included which 
<A NAME="707"></A>distinguish the sexes, reference must be made to the treatises on Anatomy 
<A NAME="708"></A>and to the Researches concerning Animals.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="709"></A><B>Part 9</B>

<A NAME="710"></A><BR><BR>We come now to the Cephalopoda. Their internal organs have already 
<A NAME="711"></A>been described with those of other animals. Externally there is the trunk 
<A NAME="712"></A>of the body, not distinctly defined, and in front of this the head surrounded 
<A NAME="713"></A>by feet, which form a circle about the mouth and teeth, and are set between 
<A NAME="714"></A>these and the eyes. Now in all other animals the feet, if there are any, 
<A NAME="715"></A>are disposed in one of two ways; either before and behind or along the 
<A NAME="716"></A>sides, the latter being the plan in such of them, for instance, as are 
<A NAME="717"></A>bloodless and have numerous feet. But in the Cephalopoda there is a peculiar 
<A NAME="718"></A>arrangement, different from either of these. For their feet are all placed 
<A NAME="719"></A>at what may be called the fore end. The reason for this is that the hind 
<A NAME="720"></A>part of their body has been drawn up close to the fore part, as is also 
<A NAME="721"></A>the case in the turbinated Testacea. For the Testacea, while in some points 
<A NAME="722"></A>they resemble the Crustacea, in others resemble the Cephalopoda. Their 
<A NAME="723"></A>earthy matter is on the outside, and their fleshy substance within. So 
<A NAME="724"></A>far they are like the Crustacea. But the general plan of their body is 
<A NAME="725"></A>that of the Cephalopoda; and, though this is true in a certain degree of 
<A NAME="726"></A>all the Testacea, it is more especially true of those turbinated species 
<A NAME="727"></A>that have a spiral shell. Of this general plan, common to the two, we will 
<A NAME="728"></A>speak presently. But let us first consider the case of quadrupeds and of 
<A NAME="729"></A>man, where the arrangement is that of a straight line. Let A at the upper 
<A NAME="730"></A>end of such a line be supposed to represent the mouth, then B the gullet, 
<A NAME="731"></A>and C the stomach, and the intestine to run from this C to the excremental 
<A NAME="732"></A>vent where D is inscribed. Such is the plan in sanguineous animals; and 
<A NAME="733"></A>round this straight line as an axis are disposed the head and so-called 
<A NAME="734"></A>trunk; the remaining parts, such as the anterior and posterior limbs, having 
<A NAME="735"></A>been superadded by nature, merely to minister to these and for 
<A NAME="736"></A>locomotion.
<A NAME="737"></A><BR><BR>In the Crustacea also and in Insects there is a tendency to a similar 
<A NAME="738"></A>arrangement of the internal parts in a straight line; the distinction between 
<A NAME="739"></A>these groups and the sanguineous animals depending on differences of the 
<A NAME="740"></A>external organs which minister to locomotion. But the Cephalopoda and the 
<A NAME="741"></A>turbinated Testacea have in common an arrangement which stands in contrast 
<A NAME="742"></A>with this. For here the two extremities are brought together by a curve, 
<A NAME="743"></A>as if one were to bend the straight line marked E until D came close to 
<A NAME="744"></A>Such, then, is the disposition of the internal parts; and round these, 
<A NAME="745"></A>in the Cephalopoda, is placed the sac (in the Poulps alone called a head), 
<A NAME="746"></A>and, in the Testacea, the turbinate shell which corresponds to the sac. 
<A NAME="747"></A>There is, in fact, only this difference between them, that the investing 
<A NAME="748"></A>substance of the Cephalopoda is soft while the shell of the Testacea is 
<A NAME="749"></A>hard, nature having surrounded their fleshy part with this hard coating 
<A NAME="750"></A>as a protection because of their limited power of locomotion. In both classes, 
<A NAME="751"></A>owing to this arrangement of the internal organs, the excrement is voided 
<A NAME="752"></A>near the mouth; at a point below this orifice in the Cephalopoda, and in 
<A NAME="753"></A>the Turbinata on one side of it.
<A NAME="754"></A><BR><BR>Such, then, is the explanation of the position of the feet in the 
<A NAME="755"></A>Cephalopoda, and of the contrast they present to other animals in this 
<A NAME="756"></A>matter. The arrangement, however, in the Sepias and the Calamaries is not 
<A NAME="757"></A>precisely the same as in the Poulps, owing to the former having no other 
<A NAME="758"></A>mode of progression than by swimming, while the latter not only swim but 
<A NAME="759"></A>crawl. For in the former six of the feet are above the teeth and small, 
<A NAME="760"></A>the outer one on either side being the biggest; while the remaining two, 
<A NAME="761"></A>which make up the total weight, are below the mouth and are the biggest 
<A NAME="762"></A>of all, just as the hind limbs in quadrupeds are stronger than the fore 
<A NAME="763"></A>limbs. For it is these that have to support the weight, and to take the 
<A NAME="764"></A>main part in locomotion. And the outer two of the upper six are bigger 
<A NAME="765"></A>than the pair which intervene between them and the uppermost of all, because 
<A NAME="766"></A>they have to assist the lowermost pair in their office. In the Poulps, 
<A NAME="767"></A>on the other hand, the four central feet are the biggest. Again, though 
<A NAME="768"></A>the number of feet is the same in all the Cephalopoda, namely eight, their 
<A NAME="769"></A>length varies in different kinds, being short in the Sepias and the Calamaries, 
<A NAME="770"></A>but greater in the Poulps. For in these latter the trunk of the body is 
<A NAME="771"></A>of small bulk, while in the former it is of considerable size; and so in 
<A NAME="772"></A>the one case nature has used the materials subtracted from the body to 
<A NAME="773"></A>give length to the feet, while in the other she has acted in precisely 
<A NAME="774"></A>the opposite way, and has given to the growth of the body what she has 
<A NAME="775"></A>first taken from the feet. The Poulps, then, owing to the length of their 
<A NAME="776"></A>feet, can not only swim but crawl, whereas in the other genera the feet 
<A NAME="777"></A>are useless for the latter mode of progression, being small while the bulk 
<A NAME="778"></A>of the body is considerable. These short feet would not enable their possessors 
<A NAME="779"></A>to cling to the rocks and keep themselves from being torn off by the waves 
<A NAME="780"></A>when these run high in times of storm; neither would they serve to lay 
<A NAME="781"></A>hold of objects at all remote and bring them in; but, to supply these defects, 
<A NAME="782"></A>the animal is furnished with two long proboscises, by which it can moor 
<A NAME="783"></A>itself and ride at anchor like a ship in rough weather. These same processes 
<A NAME="784"></A>serve also to catch prey at a distance and to bring it to the mouth. They 
<A NAME="785"></A>are so used by both the Sepias and the Calamaries. In the Poulps the feet 
<A NAME="786"></A>are themselves able to perform these offices, and there are consequently 
<A NAME="787"></A>no proboscises. Proboscises and twining tentacles, with acetabula set upon 
<A NAME="788"></A>them, act in the same way and have the same structure as those plaited 
<A NAME="789"></A>instruments which were used by physicians of old to reduce dislocations 
<A NAME="790"></A>of the fingers. Like these they are made by the interlacing of their fibres, 
<A NAME="791"></A>and they act by pulling upon pieces of flesh and yielding substances. For 
<A NAME="792"></A>the plaited fibres encircle an object in a slackened condition, and when 
<A NAME="793"></A>they are put on the stretch they grasp and cling tightly to whatever it 
<A NAME="794"></A>may be that is in contact with their inner surface. Since, then, the Cephalopoda 
<A NAME="795"></A>have no other instruments with which to convey anything to themselves from 
<A NAME="796"></A>without, than either twining tentacles, as in some species, or proboscises 
<A NAME="797"></A>as in others, they are provided with these to serve as hands for offence 
<A NAME="798"></A>and defence and other necessary uses.
<A NAME="799"></A><BR><BR>The acetabula are set in double line in all the Cephalopoda excepting 
<A NAME="800"></A>in one kind of poulp, where there is but a single row. The length and the 
<A NAME="801"></A>slimness which is part of the nature of this kind of poulp explain the 
<A NAME="802"></A>exception. For a narrow space cannot possibly admit of more than a single 
<A NAME="803"></A>row. This exceptional character, then, belongs to them, not because it 
<A NAME="804"></A>is the most advantageous arrangement, but because it is the necessary consequence 
<A NAME="805"></A>of their essential specific constitution.
<A NAME="806"></A><BR><BR>In all these animals there is a fin, encircling the sac. In the 
<A NAME="807"></A>Poulps and the Sepias this fin is unbroken and continuous, as is also the 
<A NAME="808"></A>case in the larger calamaries known as Teuthi. But in the smaller kind, 
<A NAME="809"></A>called Teuthides, the fin is not only broader than in the Sepias and the 
<A NAME="810"></A>Poulps, where it is very narrow, but, moreover, does not encircle the entire 
<A NAME="811"></A>sac, but only begins in the middle of the side. The use of this fin is 
<A NAME="812"></A>to enable the animal to swim, and also to direct its course. It acts, that 
<A NAME="813"></A>is, like the rump-feathers in birds, or the tail-fin in fishes. In none 
<A NAME="814"></A>is it so small or so indistinct as in the Poulps. For in these the body 
<A NAME="815"></A>is of small bulk and can be steered by the feet sufficiently well without 
<A NAME="816"></A>other assistance.
<A NAME="817"></A><BR><BR>The Insects, the Crustacea, the Testacea, and the Cephalopoda, 
<A NAME="818"></A>have now been dealt with in turn; and their parts have been described, 
<A NAME="819"></A>whether internal or external.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="820"></A><B>Part 10</B>

<A NAME="821"></A><BR><BR>We must now go back to the animals that have blood, and consider 
<A NAME="822"></A>such of their parts, already enumerated, as were before passed over. We 
<A NAME="823"></A>will take the viviparous animals first, and, we have done with these, will 
<A NAME="824"></A>pass on to the oviparous, and treat of them in like 
<A NAME="825"></A>manner.
<A NAME="826"></A><BR><BR>The parts that border on the head, and on what is known as the 
<A NAME="827"></A>neck and throat, have already been taken into consideration. All animals 
<A NAME="828"></A>that have blood have a head; whereas in some bloodless animals, such as 
<A NAME="829"></A>crabs, the part which represents a head is not clearly defined. As to the 
<A NAME="830"></A>neck, it is present in all the Vivipara, but only in some of the Ovipara; 
<A NAME="831"></A>for while those that have a lung also have a neck, those that do not inhale 
<A NAME="832"></A>the outer air have none. The head exists mainly for the sake of the brain. 
<A NAME="833"></A>For every animal that has blood must of necessity have a brain; and must, 
<A NAME="834"></A>moreover, for reasons already given, have it placed in an opposite region 
<A NAME="835"></A>to the heart. But the head has also been chosen by nature as the part in 
<A NAME="836"></A>which to set some of the senses; because its blood is mixed in such suitable 
<A NAME="837"></A>proportions as to ensure their tranquillity and precision, while at the 
<A NAME="838"></A>same time it can supply the brain with such warmth as it requires. There 
<A NAME="839"></A>is yet a third constituent superadded to the head, namely the part which 
<A NAME="840"></A>ministers to the ingestion of food. This has been placed here by nature, 
<A NAME="841"></A>because such a situation accords best with the general configuration of 
<A NAME="842"></A>the body. For the stomach could not possibly be placed above the heart, 
<A NAME="843"></A>seeing that this is the sovereign organ; and if placed below, as in fact 
<A NAME="844"></A>it is, then the mouth could not possibly be placed there also. For this 
<A NAME="845"></A>would have necessitated a great increase in the length of the body; and 
<A NAME="846"></A>the stomach, moreover, would have been removed too far from the source 
<A NAME="847"></A>of motion and of concoction.
<A NAME="848"></A><BR><BR>The head, then, exists for the sake of these three parts; while 
<A NAME="849"></A>the neck, again, exists for the sake of the windpipe. For it acts as a 
<A NAME="850"></A>defence to this and to the oesophagus, encircling them and keeping them 
<A NAME="851"></A>from injury. In all other animals this neck is flexible and contains several 
<A NAME="852"></A>vertebrae; but in wolves and lions it contains only a single bone. For 
<A NAME="853"></A>the object of nature was to give these animals an organ which should be 
<A NAME="854"></A>serviceable in the way of strength, rather than one that should be useful 
<A NAME="855"></A>for any of the other purposes to which necks are subservient.
<A NAME="856"></A><BR><BR>Continuous with the head and neck is the trunk with the anterior 
<A NAME="857"></A>limbs. In man the forelegs and forefeet are replaced by arms and by what 
<A NAME="858"></A>we call hands. For of all animals man alone stands erect, in accordance 
<A NAME="859"></A>with his godlike nature and essence. For it is the function of the god-like 
<A NAME="860"></A>to think and to be wise; and no easy task were this under the burden of 
<A NAME="861"></A>a heavy body, pressing down from above and obstructing by its weight the 
<A NAME="862"></A>motions of the intellect and of the general sense. When, moreover, the 
<A NAME="863"></A>weight and corporeal substance become excessive, the body must of necessity 
<A NAME="864"></A>incline towards the ground. In such cases therefore nature, in order to 
<A NAME="865"></A>give support to the body, has replaced the arms and hands by forefeet, 
<A NAME="866"></A>and has thus converted the animal into a quadruped. For, as every animal 
<A NAME="867"></A>that walks must of necessity have the two hinder feet, such an animal becomes 
<A NAME="868"></A>a quadruped, its body inclining downwards in front from the weight which 
<A NAME="869"></A>its soul cannot sustain. For all animals, man alone excepted, are dwarf-like 
<A NAME="870"></A>in form. For the dwarf-like is that in which the upper part is large, while 
<A NAME="871"></A>that which bears the weight and is used in progression is small. This upper 
<A NAME="872"></A>part is what we call the trunk, which reaches from the mouth to the vent. 
<A NAME="873"></A>In man it is duly proportionate to the part below, and diminishes much 
<A NAME="874"></A>in its comparative size as the man attains to full growth. But in his infancy 
<A NAME="875"></A>the contrary obtains, and the upper parts are large, while the lower part 
<A NAME="876"></A>is small; so that the infant can only crawl, and is unable to walk; nay, 
<A NAME="877"></A>at first cannot even crawl, but remains without motion. For all children 
<A NAME="878"></A>are dwarfs in shape, but cease to be so as they become men, from the growth 
<A NAME="879"></A>of their lower part; whereas in quadrupeds the reverse occurs, their lower 
<A NAME="880"></A>parts being largest in youth, and advance of years bringing increased growth 
<A NAME="881"></A>above, that is in the trunk, which extends from the rump to the head. Thus 
<A NAME="882"></A>it is that colts are scarcely, if at all, below full-grown horses in height; 
<A NAME="883"></A>and that while still young they can touch their heads with the hind legs, 
<A NAME="884"></A>though this is no longer possible when they are older. Such, then, is the 
<A NAME="885"></A>form of animals that have either a solid or a cloven hoof. But such as 
<A NAME="886"></A>are polydactylous and without horns, though they too are of dwarf-like 
<A NAME="887"></A>shape, are so in a less degree; and therefore the greater growth of the 
<A NAME="888"></A>lower parts as compared with the upper is also small, being proportionate 
<A NAME="889"></A>to this smaller deficiency.
<A NAME="890"></A><BR><BR>Dwarf-like again is the race of birds and fishes; and so in fact, 
<A NAME="891"></A>as already has been said, is every animal that has blood. This is the reason 
<A NAME="892"></A>why no other animal is so intelligent as man. For even among men themselves 
<A NAME="893"></A>if we compare children with adults, or such adults as are of dwarf-like 
<A NAME="894"></A>shape with such as are not, we find that, whatever other superiority the 
<A NAME="895"></A>former may possess, they are at any rate deficient as compared with the 
<A NAME="896"></A>latter in intelligence. The explanation, as already stated, is that their 
<A NAME="897"></A>psychical principle is corporeal, and much impeded in its motions. Let 
<A NAME="898"></A>now a further decrease occur in the elevating heat, and a further increase 
<A NAME="899"></A>in the earthy matter, and the animals become smaller in bulk, and their 
<A NAME="900"></A>feet more numerous, until at a later stage they become apodous, and extended 
<A NAME="901"></A>full length on the ground. Then, by further small successions of change, 
<A NAME="902"></A>they come to have their principal organ below; and at last their cephalic 
<A NAME="903"></A>part becomes motionless and destitute of sensation. Thus the animal becomes 
<A NAME="904"></A>a plant, that has its upper parts downwards and its lower parts above. 
<A NAME="905"></A>For in plants the roots are the equivalents of mouth and head, while the 
<A NAME="906"></A>seed has an opposite significance, for it is produced above it the extremities 
<A NAME="907"></A>of the twigs.
<A NAME="908"></A><BR><BR>The reasons have now been stated why some animals have many feet, 
<A NAME="909"></A>some only two, and others none; why, also, some living things are plants 
<A NAME="910"></A>and others animals; and, lastly, why man alone of all animals stands erect. 
<A NAME="911"></A>Standing thus erect, man has no need of legs in front, and in their stead 
<A NAME="912"></A>has been endowed by nature with arms and hands. Now it is the opinion of 
<A NAME="913"></A>Anaxagoras that the possession of these hands is the cause of man being 
<A NAME="914"></A>of all animals the most intelligent. But it is more rational to suppose 
<A NAME="915"></A>that his endowment with hands is the consequence rather than the cause 
<A NAME="916"></A>of his superior intelligence. For the hands are instruments or organs, 
<A NAME="917"></A>and the invariable plan of nature in distributing the organs is to give 
<A NAME="918"></A>each to such animal as can make use of it; nature acting in this matter 
<A NAME="919"></A>as any prudent man would do. For it is a better plan to take a person who 
<A NAME="920"></A>is already a flute-player and give him a flute, than to take one who possesses 
<A NAME="921"></A>a flute and teach him the art of flute-playing. For nature adds that which 
<A NAME="922"></A>is less to that which is greater and more important, and not that which 
<A NAME="923"></A>is more valuable and greater to that which is less. Seeing then that such 
<A NAME="924"></A>is the better course, and seeing also that of what is possible nature invariably 
<A NAME="925"></A>brings about the best, we must conclude that man does not owe his superior 
<A NAME="926"></A>intelligence to his hands, but his hands to his superior intelligence. 
<A NAME="927"></A>For the most intelligent of animals is the one who would put the most organs 
<A NAME="928"></A>to use; and the hand is not to be looked on as one organ but as many; for 
<A NAME="929"></A>it is, as it were, an instrument for further instruments. This instrument, 
<A NAME="930"></A>therefore,-the hand-of all instruments the most variously serviceable, 
<A NAME="931"></A>has been given by nature to man, the animal of all animals the most capable 
<A NAME="932"></A>of acquiring the most varied handicrafts.
<A NAME="933"></A><BR><BR>Much in error, then, are they who say that the construction of 
<A NAME="934"></A>man is not only faulty, but inferior to that of all other animals; seeing 
<A NAME="935"></A>that he is, as they point out, bare-footed, naked, and without weapon of 
<A NAME="936"></A>which to avail himself. For other animals have each but one mode of defence, 
<A NAME="937"></A>and this they can never change; so that they must perform all the offices 
<A NAME="938"></A>of life and even, so to speak, sleep with sandals on, never laying aside 
<A NAME="939"></A>whatever serves as a protection to their bodies, nor changing such single 
<A NAME="940"></A>weapon as they may chance to possess. But to man numerous modes of defence 
<A NAME="941"></A>are open, and these, moreover, he may change at will; as also he may adopt 
<A NAME="942"></A>such weapon as he pleases, and at such times as suit him. For the hand 
<A NAME="943"></A>is talon, hoof, and horn, at will. So too it is spear, and sword, and whatsoever 
<A NAME="944"></A>other weapon or instrument you please; for all these can it be from its 
<A NAME="945"></A>power of grasping and holding them all. In harmony with this varied office 
<A NAME="946"></A>is the form which nature has contrived for it. For it is split into several 
<A NAME="947"></A>divisions, and these are capable of divergence. Such capacity of divergence 
<A NAME="948"></A>does not prevent their again converging so as to form a single compact 
<A NAME="949"></A>body, whereas had the hand been an undivided mass, divergence would have 
<A NAME="950"></A>been impossible. The divisions also may be used singly or two together 
<A NAME="951"></A>and in various combinations. The joints, moreover, of the fingers are well 
<A NAME="952"></A>constructed for prehension and for pressure. One of these also, and this 
<A NAME="953"></A>not long like the rest but short and thick, is placed laterally. For were 
<A NAME="954"></A>it not so placed all prehension would be as impossible, as were there no 
<A NAME="955"></A>hand at all. For the pressure of this digit is applied from below upwards, 
<A NAME="956"></A>while the rest act from above downwards; an arrangement which is essential, 
<A NAME="957"></A>if the grasp is to be firm and hold like a tight clamp. As for the shortness 
<A NAME="958"></A>of this digit, the object is to increase its strength, so that it may be 
<A NAME="959"></A>able, though but one, to counterbalance its more numerous opponents. Moreover, 
<A NAME="960"></A>were it long it would be of no use. This is the explanation of its being 
<A NAME="961"></A>sometimes called the great digit, in spite of its small size; for without 
<A NAME="962"></A>it all the rest would be practically useless. The finger which stands at 
<A NAME="963"></A>the other end of the row is small, while the central one of all is long, 
<A NAME="964"></A>like a centre oar in a ship. This is rightly so; for it is mainly by the 
<A NAME="965"></A>central part of the encircling grasp that a tool must be held when put 
<A NAME="966"></A>to use.
<A NAME="967"></A><BR><BR>No less skilfully contrived are the nails. For, while in man these 
<A NAME="968"></A>serve simply as coverings to protect the tips of the fingers, in other 
<A NAME="969"></A>animals they are also used for active purposes; and their form in each 
<A NAME="970"></A>case is suited to their office.
<A NAME="971"></A><BR><BR>The arms in man and the fore limbs in quadrupeds bend in contrary 
<A NAME="972"></A>directions, this difference having reference to the ingestion of food and 
<A NAME="973"></A>to the other offices which belong to these parts. For quadrupeds must of 
<A NAME="974"></A>necessity bend their anterior limbs inwards that they may serve in locomotion, 
<A NAME="975"></A>for they use them as feet. Not but what even among quadrupeds there is 
<A NAME="976"></A>at any rate a tendency for such as are polydactylous to use their forefeet 
<A NAME="977"></A>not only for locomotion but as hands. And they are in fact so used, as 
<A NAME="978"></A>any one may see. For these animals seize hold of objects, and also repel 
<A NAME="979"></A>assailants with their anterior limbs; whereas quadrupeds with solid hoofs 
<A NAME="980"></A>use their hind legs for this latter purpose. For their fore limbs are not 
<A NAME="981"></A>analogous to the arms and hands of man.
<A NAME="982"></A><BR><BR>It is this hand-like office of the anterior limbs which explains 
<A NAME="983"></A>why in some of the polydactylous quadrupeds, such as wolves, lions, dogs, 
<A NAME="984"></A>and leopards, there are actually five digits on each forefoot, though there 
<A NAME="985"></A>are only four on each hind one. For the fifth digit of the foot corresponds 
<A NAME="986"></A>to the fifth digit of the hand, and like it is called the big one. It is 
<A NAME="987"></A>true that in the smaller polydactylous quadrupeds the hind feet also have 
<A NAME="988"></A>each five toes. But this is because these animals are creepers; and the 
<A NAME="989"></A>increased number of nails serves to give them a tighter grip, and so enables 
<A NAME="990"></A>them to creep up steep places with greater facility, or even to run head 
<A NAME="991"></A>downwards.
<A NAME="992"></A><BR><BR>In man between the arms, and in other animals between the forelegs, 
<A NAME="993"></A>lies what is called the breast. This in man is broad, as one might expect; 
<A NAME="994"></A>for as the arms are set laterally on the body, they offer no impediment 
<A NAME="995"></A>to such expansion in this part. But in quadrupeds the breast is narrow, 
<A NAME="996"></A>owing to the legs having to be extended in a forward direction in progression 
<A NAME="997"></A>and locomotion.
<A NAME="998"></A><BR><BR>Owing to this narrowness the mammae of quadrupeds are never placed 
<A NAME="999"></A>on the breast. But in the human body there is ample space in this part; 
<A NAME="1000"></A>moreover, the heart and neighbouring organs require protection, and for 
<A NAME="1001"></A>these reasons this part is fleshy and the mammae are placed upon it separately, 
<A NAME="1002"></A>side by side, being themselves of a fleshy substance in the male and therefore 
<A NAME="1003"></A>of use in the way just stated; while in the female, nature, in accordance 
<A NAME="1004"></A>with what we say is her frequent practice, makes them minister to an additional 
<A NAME="1005"></A>function, employing them as a store-place of nutriment for the offspring. 
<A NAME="1006"></A>The human mammae are two in number, in accordance with the division of 
<A NAME="1007"></A>the body into two halves, a right and a left. They are somewhat firmer 
<A NAME="1008"></A>than they would otherwise be, because the ribs in this region are joined 
<A NAME="1009"></A>together; while they form two separate masses, because their presence is 
<A NAME="1010"></A>in no wise burdensome. In other animals than man, it is impossible for 
<A NAME="1011"></A>the mammae to be placed on the breast between the forelegs, for they would 
<A NAME="1012"></A>interfere with locomotion; they are therefore disposed of otherwise, and 
<A NAME="1013"></A>in a variety of ways. Thus in such animals as produce but few at a birth, 
<A NAME="1014"></A>whether horned quadrupeds or those with solid hoofs, the mammae are placed 
<A NAME="1015"></A>in the region of the thighs, and are two in number, while in such as produce 
<A NAME="1016"></A>litters, or such as are polydactylous, the dugs are either numerous and 
<A NAME="1017"></A>placed laterally on the belly, as in swine and dogs, or are only two in 
<A NAME="1018"></A>number, being set, however, in the centre of the abdomen, as is the case 
<A NAME="1019"></A>in the lion. The explanation of this latter condition is not that the lion 
<A NAME="1020"></A>produces few at a birth, for sometimes it has more than two cubs at a time, 
<A NAME="1021"></A>but is to be found in the fact that this animal has no plentiful supply 
<A NAME="1022"></A>of milk. For, being a flesheater, it gets food at but rare intervals, and 
<A NAME="1023"></A>such nourishment as it obtains is all expended on the growth of its 
<A NAME="1024"></A>body.
<A NAME="1025"></A><BR><BR>In the elephant also there are but two mammae, which are placed 
<A NAME="1026"></A>under the axillae of the fore limbs. The mammae are not more than two, 
<A NAME="1027"></A>because this animal has only a single young one at a birth; and they are 
<A NAME="1028"></A>not placed in the region of the thighs, because they never occupy that 
<A NAME="1029"></A>position in any polydactylous animal such as this. Lastly, they are placed 
<A NAME="1030"></A>above, close to the axillae, because this is the position of the foremost 
<A NAME="1031"></A>dugs in all animals whose dugs are numerous, and the dugs so placed give 
<A NAME="1032"></A>the most milk. Evidence of this is furnished by the sow. For she always 
<A NAME="1033"></A>presents these foremost dugs to the first-born of her litter. A single 
<A NAME="1034"></A>young one is of course a first-born, and so such animals as only produce 
<A NAME="1035"></A>a single young one must have these anterior dugs to present to it; that 
<A NAME="1036"></A>is they must have the dugs which are under the axillae. This, then, is 
<A NAME="1037"></A>the reason why the elephant has but two mammae, and why they are so placed. 
<A NAME="1038"></A>But, in such animals as have litters of young, the dugs are disposed about 
<A NAME="1039"></A>the belly; the reason being that more dugs are required by those that will 
<A NAME="1040"></A>have more young to nourish. Now it is impossible that these dugs should 
<A NAME="1041"></A>be set transversely in rows of more than two, one, that is, for each side 
<A NAME="1042"></A>of the body, the right and the left; they must therefore be placed lengthways, 
<A NAME="1043"></A>and the only place where there is sufficient length for this is the region 
<A NAME="1044"></A>between the front and hind legs. As to the animals that are not polydactylous 
<A NAME="1045"></A>but produce few at a birth, or have horns, their dugs are placed in the 
<A NAME="1046"></A>region of the thighs. The horse, the ass, the camel are examples; all of 
<A NAME="1047"></A>which bear but a single young one at a time, and of which the two former 
<A NAME="1048"></A>have solid hoofs, while in the last the hoof is cloven. As still further 
<A NAME="1049"></A>examples may be mentioned the deer, the ox, the goat, and all other similar 
<A NAME="1050"></A>animals.
<A NAME="1051"></A><BR><BR>The explanation is that in these animals growth takes place in 
<A NAME="1052"></A>an upward direction; so that there must be an abundant collection of residual 
<A NAME="1053"></A>matter and of blood in the lower region, that is to say in the neighbourhood 
<A NAME="1054"></A>of the orifices for efflux, and here therefore nature has placed the mammae. 
<A NAME="1055"></A>For the place in which the nutriment is set in motion must also be the 
<A NAME="1056"></A>place whence nutriment can be derived by them. In man there are mammae 
<A NAME="1057"></A>in the male as well as in the female; but some of the males of other animals 
<A NAME="1058"></A>are without them. Such, for instance, is the case with horses, some stallions 
<A NAME="1059"></A>being destitute of these parts, while others that resemble their dams have 
<A NAME="1060"></A>them. Thus much then concerning the mammae.
<A NAME="1061"></A><BR><BR>Next after the breast comes the region of the belly, which is left 
<A NAME="1062"></A>unenclosed by the ribs for a reason which has already been given; namely 
<A NAME="1063"></A>that there may be no impediment to the swelling which necessarily occurs 
<A NAME="1064"></A>in the food as it gets heated, nor to the expansion of the womb in 
<A NAME="1065"></A>pregnancy.
<A NAME="1066"></A><BR><BR>At the extreme end of what is called the trunk are the parts concerned 
<A NAME="1067"></A>in the evacuation of the solid and also of the fluid residue. In all sanguineous 
<A NAME="1068"></A>animals with some few exceptions, and in all Vivipara without any exception 
<A NAME="1069"></A>at all, the same part which serves for the evacuation of the fluid residue 
<A NAME="1070"></A>is also made by nature to serve in sexual congress, and this alike in male 
<A NAME="1071"></A>and female. For the semen is a kind of fluid and residual matter. The proof 
<A NAME="1072"></A>of this will be given hereafter, but for the present let it taken for granted. 
<A NAME="1073"></A>(The like holds good of the menstrual fluid in women, and of the part where 
<A NAME="1074"></A>they emit semen. This also, however, is a matter of which a more accurate 
<A NAME="1075"></A>account will be given hereafter. For the present let it be simply stated 
<A NAME="1076"></A>as a fact, that the catamenia of the female like the semen of the male 
<A NAME="1077"></A>are residual matter. Both of them, moreover, being fluid, it is only natural 
<A NAME="1078"></A>that the parts which serve for voidance of the urine should give issue 
<A NAME="1079"></A>to residues which resemble it in character.) Of the internal structure 
<A NAME="1080"></A>of these parts, and of the differences which exist between the parts concerned 
<A NAME="1081"></A>with semen and the parts concerned with conception, a clear account is 
<A NAME="1082"></A>given in the book of Researches concerning Animals and in the treatises 
<A NAME="1083"></A>on Anatomy. Moreover, I shall have to speak of them again when I come to 
<A NAME="1084"></A>deal with Generation. As regards, however, the external shape of these 
<A NAME="1085"></A>parts, it is plain enough that they are adapted to
