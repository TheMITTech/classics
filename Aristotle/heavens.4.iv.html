<A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A><B>Part 1</B>
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="11"></A>We have now to consider the terms 'heavy' and 'light'. We must ask what 
<A NAME="12"></A>the bodies so called are, how they are constituted, and what is the reason 
<A NAME="13"></A>of their possessing these powers. The consideration of these questions 
<A NAME="14"></A>is a proper part of the theory of movement, since we call things heavy 
<A NAME="15"></A>and light because they have the power of being moved naturally in a certain 
<A NAME="16"></A>way. The activities corresponding to these powers have not been given any 
<A NAME="17"></A>name, unless it is thought that 'impetus' is such a name. But because the 
<A NAME="18"></A>inquiry into nature is concerned with movement, and these things have in 
<A NAME="19"></A>themselves some spark (as it were) of movement, all inquirers avail themselves 
<A NAME="20"></A>of these powers, though in all but a few cases without exact discrimination. 
<A NAME="21"></A>We must then first look at whatever others have said, and formulate the 
<A NAME="22"></A>questions which require settlement in the interests of this inquiry, before 
<A NAME="23"></A>we go on to state our own view of the matter.
<A NAME="24"></A><BR><BR>Language recognizes (a) an absolute, (b) a relative heavy and light. 
<A NAME="25"></A>Of two heavy things, such as wood and bronze, we say that the one is relatively 
<A NAME="26"></A>light, the other relatively heavy. Our predecessors have not dealt at all 
<A NAME="27"></A>with the absolute use, of the terms, but only with the relative. I mean, 
<A NAME="28"></A>they do not explain what the heavy is or what the light is, but only the 
<A NAME="29"></A>relative heaviness and lightness of things possessing weight. This can 
<A NAME="30"></A>be made clearer as follows. There are things whose constant nature it is 
<A NAME="31"></A>to move away from the centre, while others move constantly towards the 
<A NAME="32"></A>centre; and of these movements that which is away from the centre I call 
<A NAME="33"></A>upward movement and that which is towards it I call downward movement. 
<A NAME="34"></A>(The view, urged by some, that there is no up and no down in the heaven, 
<A NAME="35"></A>is absurd. There can be, they say, no up and no down, since the universe 
<A NAME="36"></A>is similar every way, and from any point on the earth's surface a man by 
<A NAME="37"></A>advancing far enough will come to stand foot to foot with himself. But 
<A NAME="38"></A>the extremity of the whole, which we call 'above', is in position above 
<A NAME="39"></A>and in nature primary. And since the universe has an extremity and a centre, 
<A NAME="40"></A>it must clearly have an up and down. Common usage is thus correct, though 
<A NAME="41"></A>inadequate. And the reason of its inadequacy is that men think that the 
<A NAME="42"></A>universe is not similar every way. They recognize only the hemisphere which 
<A NAME="43"></A>is over us. But if they went on to think of the world as formed on this 
<A NAME="44"></A>pattern all round, with a centre identically related to each point on the 
<A NAME="45"></A>extremity, they would have to admit that the extremity was above and the 
<A NAME="46"></A>centre below.) By absolutely light, then, we mean that which moves upward 
<A NAME="47"></A>or to the extremity, and by absolutely heavy that which moves downward 
<A NAME="48"></A>or to the centre. By lighter or relatively light we mean that one, of two 
<A NAME="49"></A>bodies endowed with weight and equal in bulk, which is exceeded by the 
<A NAME="50"></A>other in the speed of its natural downward movement.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="51"></A><B>Part 2</B>

<A NAME="52"></A><BR><BR>Those of our predecessors who have entered upon this inquiry have 
<A NAME="53"></A>for the most part spoken of light and heavy things only in the sense in 
<A NAME="54"></A>which one of two things both endowed with weight is said to be the lighter. 
<A NAME="55"></A>And this treatment they consider a sufficient analysis also of the notions 
<A NAME="56"></A>of absolute heaviness, to which their account does not apply. This, however, 
<A NAME="57"></A>will become clearer as we advance. One use of the terms 'lighter' and 'heavier' 
<A NAME="58"></A>is that which is set forth in writing in the Timaeus, that the body which 
<A NAME="59"></A>is composed of the greater number of identical parts is relatively heavy, 
<A NAME="60"></A>while that which is composed of a smaller number is relatively light. As 
<A NAME="61"></A>a larger quantity of lead or of bronze is heavier than a smaller-and this 
<A NAME="62"></A>holds good of all homogeneous masses, the superior weight always depending 
<A NAME="63"></A>upon a numerical superiority of equal parts-in precisely the same way, 
<A NAME="64"></A>they assert, lead is heavier than wood. For all bodies, in spite of the 
<A NAME="65"></A>general opinion to the contrary, are composed of identical parts and of 
<A NAME="66"></A>a single material. But this analysis says nothing of the absolutely heavy 
<A NAME="67"></A>and light. The facts are that fire is always light and moves upward, while 
<A NAME="68"></A>earth and all earthy things move downwards or towards the centre. It cannot 
<A NAME="69"></A>then be the fewness of the triangles (of which, in their view, all these 
<A NAME="70"></A>bodies are composed) which disposes fire to move upward. If it were, the 
<A NAME="71"></A>greater the quantity of fire the slower it would move, owing to the increase 
<A NAME="72"></A>of weight due to the increased number of triangles. But the palpable fact, 
<A NAME="73"></A>on the contrary, is that the greater the quantity, the lighter the mass 
<A NAME="74"></A>is and the quicker its upward movement: and, similarly, in the reverse 
<A NAME="75"></A>movement from above downward, the small mass will move quicker and the 
<A NAME="76"></A>large slower. Further, since to be lighter is to have fewer of these homogeneous 
<A NAME="77"></A>parts and to be heavier is to have more, and air, water, and fire are composed 
<A NAME="78"></A>of the same triangles, the only difference being in the number of such 
<A NAME="79"></A>parts, which must therefore explain any distinction of relatively light 
<A NAME="80"></A>and heavy between these bodies, it follows that there must be a certain 
<A NAME="81"></A>quantum of air which is heavier than water. But the facts are directly 
<A NAME="82"></A>opposed to this. The larger the quantity of air the more readily it moves 
<A NAME="83"></A>upward, and any portion of air without exception will rise up out of the 
<A NAME="84"></A>water.
<A NAME="85"></A><BR><BR>So much for one view of the distinction between light and heavy. 
<A NAME="86"></A>To others the analysis seems insufficient; and their views on the subject, 
<A NAME="87"></A>though they belong to an older generation than ours, have an air of novelty. 
<A NAME="88"></A>It is apparent that there are bodies which, when smaller in bulk than others, 
<A NAME="89"></A>yet exceed them in weight. It is therefore obviously insufficient to say 
<A NAME="90"></A>that bodies of equal weight are composed of an equal number of primary 
<A NAME="91"></A>parts: for that would give equality of bulk. Those who maintain that the 
<A NAME="92"></A>primary or atomic parts, of which bodies endowed with weight are composed, 
<A NAME="93"></A>are planes, cannot so speak without absurdity; but those who regard them 
<A NAME="94"></A>as solids are in a better position to assert that of such bodies the larger 
<A NAME="95"></A>is the heavier. But since in composite bodies the weight obviously does 
<A NAME="96"></A>not correspond in this way to the bulk, the lesser bulk being often superior 
<A NAME="97"></A>in weight (as, for instance, if one be wool and the other bronze), there 
<A NAME="98"></A>are some who think and say that the cause is to be found elsewhere. The 
<A NAME="99"></A>void, they say, which is imprisoned in bodies, lightens them and sometimes 
<A NAME="100"></A>makes the larger body the lighter. The reason is that there is more void. 
<A NAME="101"></A>And this would also account for the fact that a body composed of a number 
<A NAME="102"></A>of solid parts equal to, or even smaller than, that of another is sometimes 
<A NAME="103"></A>larger in bulk than it. In short, generally and in every case a body is 
<A NAME="104"></A>relatively light when it contains a relatively large amount of void. This 
<A NAME="105"></A>is the way they put it themselves, but their account requires an addition. 
<A NAME="106"></A>Relative lightness must depend not only on an excess of void, but also 
<A NAME="107"></A>an a defect of solid: for if the ratio of solid to void exceeds a certain 
<A NAME="108"></A>proportion, the relative lightness will disappear. Thus fire, they say, 
<A NAME="109"></A>is the lightest of things just for this reason that it has the most void. 
<A NAME="110"></A>But it would follow that a large mass of gold, as containing more void 
<A NAME="111"></A>than a small mass of fire, is lighter than it, unless it also contains 
<A NAME="112"></A>many times as much solid. The addition is therefore 
<A NAME="113"></A>necessary.
<A NAME="114"></A><BR><BR>Of those who deny the existence of a void some, like Anaxagoras 
<A NAME="115"></A>and Empedocles, have not tried to analyse the notions of light and heavy 
<A NAME="116"></A>at all; and those who, while still denying the existence of a void, have 
<A NAME="117"></A>attempted this, have failed to explain why there are bodies which are absolutely 
<A NAME="118"></A>heavy and light, or in other words why some move upward and others downward. 
<A NAME="119"></A>The fact, again, that the body of greater bulk is sometimes lighter than 
<A NAME="120"></A>smaller bodies is one which they have passed over in silence, and what 
<A NAME="121"></A>they have said gives no obvious suggestion for reconciling their views 
<A NAME="122"></A>with the observed facts.
<A NAME="123"></A><BR><BR>But those who attribute the lightness of fire to its containing 
<A NAME="124"></A>so much void are necessarily involved in practically the same difficulties. 
<A NAME="125"></A>For though fire be supposed to contain less solid than any other body, 
<A NAME="126"></A>as well as more void, yet there will be a certain quantum of fire in which 
<A NAME="127"></A>the amount of solid or plenum is in excess of the solids contained in some 
<A NAME="128"></A>small quantity of earth. They may reply that there is an excess of void 
<A NAME="129"></A>also. But the question is, how will they discriminate the absolutely heavy? 
<A NAME="130"></A>Presumably, either by its excess of solid or by its defect of void. On 
<A NAME="131"></A>the former view there could be an amount of earth so small as to contain 
<A NAME="132"></A>less solid than a large mass of fire. And similarly, if the distinction 
<A NAME="133"></A>rests on the amount of void, there will be a body, lighter than the absolutely 
<A NAME="134"></A>light, which nevertheless moves downward as constantly as the other moves 
<A NAME="135"></A>upward. But that cannot be so, since the absolutely light is always lighter 
<A NAME="136"></A>than bodies which have weight and move downward, while, on the other hand, 
<A NAME="137"></A>that which is lighter need not be light, because in common speech we distinguish 
<A NAME="138"></A>a lighter and a heavier (viz. water and earth) among bodies endowed with 
<A NAME="139"></A>weight. Again, the suggestion of a certain ratio between the void and the 
<A NAME="140"></A>solid in a body is no more equal to solving the problem before us. The 
<A NAME="141"></A>manner of speaking will issue in a similar impossibility. For any two portions 
<A NAME="142"></A>of fire, small or great, will exhibit the same ratio of solid to void, 
<A NAME="143"></A>but the upward movement of the greater is quicker than that of the less, 
<A NAME="144"></A>just as the downward movement of a mass of gold or lead, or of any other 
<A NAME="145"></A>body endowed with weight, is quicker in proportion to its size. This, however, 
<A NAME="146"></A>should not be the case if the ratio is the ground of distinction between 
<A NAME="147"></A>heavy things and light. There is also an absurdity in attributing the upward 
<A NAME="148"></A>movement of bodies to a void which does not itself move. If, however, it 
<A NAME="149"></A>is the nature of a void to move upward and of a plenum to move downward, 
<A NAME="150"></A>and therefore each causes a like movement in other things, there was no 
<A NAME="151"></A>need to raise the question why composite bodies are some light and some 
<A NAME="152"></A>heavy; they had only to explain why these two things are themselves light 
<A NAME="153"></A>and heavy respectively, and to give, further, the reason why the plenum 
<A NAME="154"></A>and the void are not eternally separated. It is also unreasonable to imagine 
<A NAME="155"></A>a place for the void, as if the void were not itself a kind of place. But 
<A NAME="156"></A>if the void is to move, it must have a place out of which and into which 
<A NAME="157"></A>the change carries it. Also what is the cause of its movement? Not, surely, 
<A NAME="158"></A>its voidness: for it is not the void only which is moved, but also the 
<A NAME="159"></A>solid.
<A NAME="160"></A><BR><BR>Similar difficulties are involved in all other methods of distinction, 
<A NAME="161"></A>whether they account for the relative lightness and heaviness of bodies 
<A NAME="162"></A>by distinctions of size, or proceed on any other principle, so long as 
<A NAME="163"></A>they attribute to each the same matter, or even if they recognize more 
<A NAME="164"></A>than one matter, so long as that means only a pair of contraries. If there 
<A NAME="165"></A>is a single matter, as with those who compose things of triangles, nothing 
<A NAME="166"></A>can be absolutely heavy or light: and if there is one matter and its contrary-the 
<A NAME="167"></A>void, for instance, and the plenum-no reason can be given for the relative 
<A NAME="168"></A>lightness and heaviness of the bodies intermediate between the absolutely 
<A NAME="169"></A>light and heavy when compared either with one another or with these themselves. 
<A NAME="170"></A>The view which bases the distinction upon differences of size is more like 
<A NAME="171"></A>a mere fiction than those previously mentioned, but, in that it is able 
<A NAME="172"></A>to make distinctions between the four elements, it is in a stronger position 
<A NAME="173"></A>for meeting the foregoing difficulties. Since, however, it imagines that 
<A NAME="174"></A>these bodies which differ in size are all made of one substance, it implies, 
<A NAME="175"></A>equally with the view that there is but one matter, that there is nothing 
<A NAME="176"></A>absolutely light and nothing which moves upward (except as being passed 
<A NAME="177"></A>by other things or forced up by them); and since a multitude of small atoms 
<A NAME="178"></A>are heavier than a few large ones, it will follow that much air or fire 
<A NAME="179"></A>is heavier than a little water or earth, which is impossible.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="180"></A><B>Part 3</B>

<A NAME="181"></A><BR><BR>These, then, are the views which have been advanced by others and 
<A NAME="182"></A>the terms in which they state them. We may begin our own statement by settling 
<A NAME="183"></A>a question which to some has been the main difficulty-the question why 
<A NAME="184"></A>some bodies move always and naturally upward and others downward, while 
<A NAME="185"></A>others again move both upward and downward. After that we will inquire 
<A NAME="186"></A>into light and heavy and of the various phenomena connected with them. 
<A NAME="187"></A>The local movement of each body into its own place must be regarded as 
<A NAME="188"></A>similar to what happens in connexion with other forms of generation and 
<A NAME="189"></A>change. There are, in fact, three kinds of movement, affecting respectively 
<A NAME="190"></A>the size, the form, and the place of a thing, and in each it is observable 
<A NAME="191"></A>that change proceeds from a contrary to a contrary or to something intermediate: 
<A NAME="192"></A>it is never the change of any chance subject in any chance direction, nor, 
<A NAME="193"></A>similarly, is the relation of the mover to its object fortuitous: the thing 
<A NAME="194"></A>altered is different from the thing increased, and precisely the same difference 
<A NAME="195"></A>holds between that which produces alteration and that which produces increase. 
<A NAME="196"></A>In the same manner it must be thought that produces local motion and that 
<A NAME="197"></A>which is so moved are not fortuitously related. Now, that which produces 
<A NAME="198"></A>upward and downward movement is that which produces weight and lightness, 
<A NAME="199"></A>and that which is moved is that which is potentially heavy or light, and 
<A NAME="200"></A>the movement of each body to its own place is motion towards its own form. 
<A NAME="201"></A>(It is best to interpret in this sense the common statement of the older 
<A NAME="202"></A>writers that 'like moves to like'. For the words are not in every sense 
<A NAME="203"></A>true to fact. If one were to remove the earth to where the moon now is, 
<A NAME="204"></A>the various fragments of earth would each move not towards it but to the 
<A NAME="205"></A>place in which it now is. In general, when a number of similar and undifferentiated 
<A NAME="206"></A>bodies are moved with the same motion this result is necessarily produced, 
<A NAME="207"></A>viz. that the place which is the natural goal of the movement of each single 
<A NAME="208"></A>part is also that of the whole. But since the place of a thing is the boundary 
<A NAME="209"></A>of that which contains it, and the continent of all things that move upward 
<A NAME="210"></A>or downward is the extremity and the centre, and this boundary comes to 
<A NAME="211"></A>be, in a sense, the form of that which is contained, it is to its like 
<A NAME="212"></A>that a body moves when it moves to its own place. For the successive members 
<A NAME="213"></A>of the scries are like one another: water, I mean, is like air and air 
<A NAME="214"></A>like fire, and between intermediates the relation may be converted, though 
<A NAME="215"></A>not between them and the extremes; thus air is like water, but water is 
<A NAME="216"></A>like earth: for the relation of each outer body to that which is next within 
<A NAME="217"></A>it is that of form to matter.) Thus to ask why fire moves upward and earth 
<A NAME="218"></A>downward is the same as to ask why the healable, when moved and changed 
<A NAME="219"></A>qua healable, attains health and not whiteness; and similar questions might 
<A NAME="220"></A>be asked concerning any other subject of aletion. Of course the subject 
<A NAME="221"></A>of increase, when changed qua increasable, attains not health but a superior 
<A NAME="222"></A>size. The same applies in the other cases. One thing changes in quality, 
<A NAME="223"></A>another in quantity: and so in place, a light thing goes upward, a heavy 
<A NAME="224"></A>thing downward. The only difference is that in the last case, viz. that 
<A NAME="225"></A>of the heavy and the light, the bodies are thought to have a spring of 
<A NAME="226"></A>change within themselves, while the subjects of healing and increase are 
<A NAME="227"></A>thought to be moved purely from without. Sometimes, however, even they 
<A NAME="228"></A>change of themselves, ie. in response to a slight external movement reach 
<A NAME="229"></A>health or increase, as the case may be. And since the same thing which 
<A NAME="230"></A>is healable is also receptive of disease, it depends on whether it is moved 
<A NAME="231"></A>qua healable or qua liable to disease whether the motion is towards health 
<A NAME="232"></A>or towards disease. But the reason why the heavy and the light appear more 
<A NAME="233"></A>than these things to contain within themselves the source of their movements 
<A NAME="234"></A>is that their matter is nearest to being. This is indicated by the fact 
<A NAME="235"></A>that locomotion belongs to bodies only when isolated from other bodies, 
<A NAME="236"></A>and is generated last of the several kinds of movement; in order of being 
<A NAME="237"></A>then it will be first. Now whenever air comes into being out of water, 
<A NAME="238"></A>light out of heavy, it goes to the upper place. It is forthwith light: 
<A NAME="239"></A>becoming is at an end, and in that place it has being. Obviously, then, 
<A NAME="240"></A>it is a potentiality, which, in its passage to actuality, comes into that 
<A NAME="241"></A>place and quantity and quality which belong to its actuality. And the same 
<A NAME="242"></A>fact explains why what is already actually fire or earth moves, when nothing 
<A NAME="243"></A>obstructs it, towards its own place. For motion is equally immediate in 
<A NAME="244"></A>the case of nutriment, when nothing hinders, and in the case of the thing 
<A NAME="245"></A>healed, when nothing stays the healing. But the movement is also due to 
<A NAME="246"></A>the original creative force and to that which removes the hindrance or 
<A NAME="247"></A>off which the moving thing rebounded, as was explained in our opening discussions, 
<A NAME="248"></A>where we tried to show how none of these things moves itself. The reason 
<A NAME="249"></A>of the various motions of the various bodies, and the meaning of the motion 
<A NAME="250"></A>of a body to its own place, have now been explained.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="251"></A><B>Part 4</B>

<A NAME="252"></A><BR><BR>We have now to speak of the distinctive properties of these bodies 
<A NAME="253"></A>and of the various phenomena connected with them. In accordance with general 
<A NAME="254"></A>conviction we may distinguish the absolutely heavy, as that which sinks 
<A NAME="255"></A>to the bottom of all things, from the absolutely light, which is that which 
<A NAME="256"></A>rises to the surface of all things. I use the term 'absolutely', in view 
<A NAME="257"></A>of the generic character of 'light' and 'heavy', in order to confine the 
<A NAME="258"></A>application to bodies which do not combine lightness and heaviness. It 
<A NAME="259"></A>is apparent, I mean, that fire, in whatever quantity, so long as there 
<A NAME="260"></A>is no external obstacle moves upward, and earth downward; and, if the quantity 
<A NAME="261"></A>is increased, the movement is the same, though swifter. But the heaviness 
<A NAME="262"></A>and lightness of bodies which combine these qualities is different from 
<A NAME="263"></A>this, since while they rise to the surface of some bodies they sink to 
<A NAME="264"></A>the bottom of others. Such are air and water. Neither of them is absolutely 
<A NAME="265"></A>either light or heavy. Both are lighter than earth-for any portion of either 
<A NAME="266"></A>rises to the surface of it-but heavier than fire, since a portion of either, 
<A NAME="267"></A>whatever its quantity, sinks to the bottom of fire; compared together, 
<A NAME="268"></A>however, the one has absolute weight, the other absolute lightness, since 
<A NAME="269"></A>air in any quantity rises to the surface of water, while water in any quantity 
<A NAME="270"></A>sinks to the bottom of air. Now other bodies are severally light and heavy, 
<A NAME="271"></A>and evidently in them the attributes are due to the difference of their 
<A NAME="272"></A>uncompounded parts: that is to say, according as the one or the other happens 
<A NAME="273"></A>to preponderate the bodies will be heavy and light respectively. Therefore 
<A NAME="274"></A>we need only speak of these parts, since they are primary and all else 
<A NAME="275"></A>consequential: and in so doing we shall be following the advice which we 
<A NAME="276"></A>gave to those whose attribute heaviness to the presence of plenum and lightness 
<A NAME="277"></A>to that of void. It is due to the properties of the elementary bodies that 
<A NAME="278"></A>a body which is regarded as light in one place is regarded as heavy in 
<A NAME="279"></A>another, and vice versa. In air, for instance, a talent's weight of wood 
<A NAME="280"></A>is heavier than a mina of lead, but in water the wood is the lighter. The 
<A NAME="281"></A>reason is that all the elements except fire have weight and all but earth 
<A NAME="282"></A>lightness. Earth, then, and bodies in which earth preponderates, must needs 
<A NAME="283"></A>have weight everywhere, while water is heavy anywhere but in earth, and 
<A NAME="284"></A>air is heavy when not in water or earth. In its own place each of these 
<A NAME="285"></A>bodies has weight except fire, even air. Of this we have evidence in the 
<A NAME="286"></A>fact that a bladder when inflated weighs more than when empty. A body, 
<A NAME="287"></A>then, in which air preponderates over earth and water, may well be lighter 
<A NAME="288"></A>than something in water and yet heavier than it in air, since such a body 
<A NAME="289"></A>does not rise in air but rises to the surface in water.
<A NAME="290"></A><BR><BR>The following account will make it plain that there is an absolutely 
<A NAME="291"></A>light and an absolutely heavy body. And by absolutely light I mean one 
<A NAME="292"></A>which of its own nature always moves upward, by absolutely heavy one which 
<A NAME="293"></A>of its own nature always moves downward, if no obstacle is in the way. 
<A NAME="294"></A>There are, I say, these two kinds of body, and it is not the case, as some 
<A NAME="295"></A>maintain, that all bodies have weight. Different views are in fact agreed 
<A NAME="296"></A>that there is a heavy body, which moves uniformly towards the centre. But 
<A NAME="297"></A>is also similarly a light body. For we see with our eyes, as we said before, 
<A NAME="298"></A>that earthy things sink to the bottom of all things and move towards the 
<A NAME="299"></A>centre. But the centre is a fixed point. If therefore there is some body 
<A NAME="300"></A>which rises to the surface of all things-and we observe fire to move upward 
<A NAME="301"></A>even in air itself, while the air remains at rest-clearly this body is 
<A NAME="302"></A>moving towards the extremity. It cannot then have any weight. If it had, 
<A NAME="303"></A>there would be another body in which it sank: and if that had weight, there 
<A NAME="304"></A>would be yet another which moved to the extremity and thus rose to the 
<A NAME="305"></A>surface of all moving things. In fact, however, we have no evidence of 
<A NAME="306"></A>such a body. Fire, then, has no weight. Neither has earth any lightness, 
<A NAME="307"></A>since it sinks to the bottom of all things, and that which sinks moves 
<A NAME="308"></A>to the centre. That there is a centre towards which the motion of heavy 
<A NAME="309"></A>things, and away from which that of light things is directed, is manifest 
<A NAME="310"></A>in many ways. First, because no movement can continue to infinity. For 
<A NAME="311"></A>what cannot be can no more come-to-be than be, and movement is a coming 
<A NAME="312"></A>to-be in one place from another. Secondly, like the upward movement of 
<A NAME="313"></A>fire, the downward movement of earth and all heavy things makes equal angles 
<A NAME="314"></A>on every side with the earth's surface: it must therefore be directed towards 
<A NAME="315"></A>the centre. Whether it is really the centre of the earth and not rather 
<A NAME="316"></A>that of the whole to which it moves, may be left to another inquiry, since 
<A NAME="317"></A>these are coincident. But since that which sinks to the bottom of all things 
<A NAME="318"></A>moves to the centre, necessarily that which rises to the surface moves 
<A NAME="319"></A>to the extremity of the region in which the movement of these bodies takes 
<A NAME="320"></A>place. For the centre is opposed as contrary to the extremity, as that 
<A NAME="321"></A>which sinks is opposed to that which rises to the surface. This also gives 
<A NAME="322"></A>a reasonable ground for the duality of heavy and light in the spatial duality 
<A NAME="323"></A>centre and extremity. Now there is also the intermediate region to which 
<A NAME="324"></A>each name is given in opposition to the other extreme. For that which is 
<A NAME="325"></A>intermediate between the two is in a sense both extremity and centre. For 
<A NAME="326"></A>this reason there is another heavy and light; namely, water and air. But 
<A NAME="327"></A>in our view the continent pertains to form and the contained to matter: 
<A NAME="328"></A>and this distinction is present in every genus. Alike in the sphere of 
<A NAME="329"></A>quality and in that of quantity there is that which corresponds rather 
<A NAME="330"></A>to form and that which corresponds to matter. In the same way, among spatial 
<A NAME="331"></A>distinctions, the above belongs to the determinate, the below to matter. 
<A NAME="332"></A>The same holds, consequently, also of the matter itself of that which is 
<A NAME="333"></A>heavy and light: as potentially possessing the one character, it is matter 
<A NAME="334"></A>for the heavy, and as potentially possessing the other, for the light. 
<A NAME="335"></A>It is the same matter, but its being is different, as that which is receptive 
<A NAME="336"></A>of disease is the same as that which is receptive of health, though in 
<A NAME="337"></A>being different from it, and therefore diseasedness is different from 
<A NAME="338"></A>healthiness.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="339"></A><B>Part 5</B>

<A NAME="340"></A><BR><BR>A thing then which has the one kind of matter is light and always 
<A NAME="341"></A>moves upward, while a thing which has the opposite matter is heavy and 
<A NAME="342"></A>always moves downward. Bodies composed of kinds of matter different from 
<A NAME="343"></A>these but having relatively to each other the character which these have 
<A NAME="344"></A>absolutely, possess both the upward and the downward motion. Hence air 
<A NAME="345"></A>and water each have both lightness and weight, and water sinks to the bottom 
<A NAME="346"></A>of all things except earth, while air rises to the surface of all things 
<A NAME="347"></A>except fire. But since there is one body only which rises to the surface 
<A NAME="348"></A>of all things and one only which sinks to the bottom of all things, there 
<A NAME="349"></A>must needs be two other bodies which sink in some bodies and rise to the 
<A NAME="350"></A>surface of others. The kinds of matter, then, must be as numerous as these 
<A NAME="351"></A>bodies, i.e. four, but though they are four there must be a common matter 
<A NAME="352"></A>of all-particularly if they pass into one another-which in each is in being 
<A NAME="353"></A>different. There is no reason why there should not be one or more intermediates 
<A NAME="354"></A>between the contraries, as in the case of colour; for 'intermediate' and 
<A NAME="355"></A>'mean' are capable of more than one application.
<A NAME="356"></A><BR><BR>Now in its own place every body endowed with both weight and lightness 
<A NAME="357"></A>has weightwhereas earth has weight everywhere-but they only have lightness 
<A NAME="358"></A>among bodies to whose surface they rise. Hence when a support is withdrawn 
<A NAME="359"></A>such a body moves downward until it reaches the body next below it, air 
<A NAME="360"></A>to the place of water and water to that of earth. But if the fire above 
<A NAME="361"></A>air is removed, it will not move upward to the place of fire, except by 
<A NAME="362"></A>constraint; and in that way water also may be drawn up, when the upward 
<A NAME="363"></A>movement of air which has had a common surface with it is swift enough 
<A NAME="364"></A>to overpower the downward impulse of the water. Nor does water move upward 
<A NAME="365"></A>to the place of air, except in the manner just described. Earth is not 
<A NAME="366"></A>so affected at all, because a common surface is not possible to it. Hence 
<A NAME="367"></A>water is drawn up into the vessel to which fire is applied, but not earth. 
<A NAME="368"></A>As earth fails to move upward, so fire fails to move downward when air 
<A NAME="369"></A>is withdrawn from beneath it: for fire has no weight even in its own place, 
<A NAME="370"></A>as earth has no lightness. The other two move downward when the body beneath 
<A NAME="371"></A>is withdrawn because, while the absolutely heavy is that which sinks to 
<A NAME="372"></A>the bottom of all things, the relatively heavy sinks to its own place or 
<A NAME="373"></A>to the surface of the body in which it rises, since it is similar in matter 
<A NAME="374"></A>to it.
<A NAME="375"></A><BR><BR>It is plain that one must suppose as many distinct species of matter 
<A NAME="376"></A>as there are bodies. For if, first, there is a single matter of all things, 
<A NAME="377"></A>as, for instance, the void or the plenum or extension or the triangles, 
<A NAME="378"></A>either all things will move upward or all things will move downward, and 
<A NAME="379"></A>the second motion will be abolished. And so, either there will be no absolutely 
<A NAME="380"></A>light body, if superiority of weight is due to superior size or number 
<A NAME="381"></A>of the constituent bodies or to the fullness of the body: but the contrary 
<A NAME="382"></A>is a matter of observation, and it has been shown that the downward and 
<A NAME="383"></A>upward movements are equally constant and universal: or, if the matter 
<A NAME="384"></A>in question is the void or something similar, which moves uniformly upward, 
<A NAME="385"></A>there will be nothing to move uniformly downward. Further, it will follow 
<A NAME="386"></A>that the intermediate bodies move downward in some cases quicker than earth: 
<A NAME="387"></A>for air in sufficiently large quantity will contain a larger number of 
<A NAME="388"></A>triangles or solids or particles. It is, however, manifest that no portion 
<A NAME="389"></A>of air whatever moves downward. And the same reasoning applies to lightness, 
<A NAME="390"></A>if that is supposed to depend on superiority of quantity of matter. But 
<A NAME="391"></A>if, secondly, the kinds of matter are two, it will be difficult to make 
<A NAME="392"></A>the intermediate bodies behave as air and water behave. Suppose, for example, 
<A NAME="393"></A>that the two asserted are void and plenum. Fire, then, as moving upward, 
<A NAME="394"></A>will be void, earth, as moving downward, plenum; and in air, it will be 
<A NAME="395"></A>said, fire preponderates, in water, earth. There will then be a quantity 
<A NAME="396"></A>of water containing more fire than a little air, and a large amount of 
<A NAME="397"></A>air will contain more earth than a little water: consequently we shall 
<A NAME="398"></A>have to say that air in a certain quantity moves downward more quickly 
<A NAME="399"></A>than a little water. But such a thing has never been observed anywhere. 
<A NAME="400"></A>Necessarily, then, as fire goes up because it has something, e.g. void, 
<A NAME="401"></A>which other things do not have, and earth goes downward because it has 
<A NAME="402"></A>plenum, so air goes to its own place above water because it has something 
<A NAME="403"></A>else, and water goes downward because of some special kind of body. But 
<A NAME="404"></A>if the two bodies are one matter, or two matters both present in each, 
<A NAME="405"></A>there will be a certain quantity of each at which water will excel a little 
<A NAME="406"></A>air in the upward movement and air excel water in the downward movement, 
<A NAME="407"></A>as we have already often said.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="408"></A><B>Part 6</B>

<A NAME="409"></A><BR><BR>The shape of bodies will not account for their moving upward or 
<A NAME="410"></A>downward in general, though it will account for their moving faster or 
<A NAME="411"></A>slower. The reasons for this are not difficult to see. For the problem 
<A NAME="412"></A>thus raised is why a flat piece of iron or lead floats upon water, while 
<A NAME="413"></A>smaller and less heavy things, so long as they are round or long-a needle, 
<A NAME="414"></A>for instance-sink down; and sometimes a thing floats because it is small, 
<A NAME="415"></A>as with gold dust and the various earthy and dusty materials which throng 
<A NAME="416"></A>the air. With regard to these questions, it is wrong to accept the explanation 
<A NAME="417"></A>offered by Democritus. He says that the warm bodies moving up out of the 
<A NAME="418"></A>water hold up heavy bodies which are broad, while the narrow ones fall 
<A NAME="419"></A>through, because the bodies which offer this resistance are not numerous. 
<A NAME="420"></A>But this would be even more likely to happen in air-an objection which 
<A NAME="421"></A>he himself raises. His reply to the objection is feeble. In the air, he 
<A NAME="422"></A>says, the 'drive' (meaning by drive the movement of the upward moving bodies) 
<A NAME="423"></A>is not uniform in direction. But since some continua are easily divided 
<A NAME="424"></A>and others less easily, and things which produce division differ similarly 
<A NAME="425"></A>in the case with which they produce it, the explanation must be found in 
<A NAME="426"></A>this fact. It is the easily bounded, in proportion as it is easily bounded, 
<A NAME="427"></A>which is easily divided; and air is more so than water, water than earth. 
<A NAME="428"></A>Further, the smaller the quantity in each kind, the more easily it is divided 
<A NAME="429"></A>and disrupted. Thus the reason why broad things keep their place is because 
<A NAME="430"></A>they cover so wide a surface and the greater quantity is less easily disrupted. 
<A NAME="431"></A>Bodies of the opposite shape sink down because they occupy so little of 
<A NAME="432"></A>the surface, which is therefore easily parted. And these considerations 
<A NAME="433"></A>apply with far greater force to air, since it is so much more easily divided 
<A NAME="434"></A>than water. But since there are two factors, the force responsible for 
<A NAME="435"></A>the downward motion of the heavy body and the disruption-resisting force 
<A NAME="436"></A>of the continuous surface, there must be some ratio between the two. For 
<A NAME="437"></A>in proportion as the force applied by the heavy thing towards disruption 
<A NAME="438"></A>and division exceeds that which resides in the continuum, the quicker will 
<A NAME="439"></A>it force its way down; only if the force of the heavy thing is the weaker, 
<A NAME="440"></A>will it ride upon the surface.
<A NAME="441"></A><BR><BR>We have now finished our examination of the heavy and the light 
<A NAME="442"></A>and of the phenomena connected with them.
