<A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A><B>Part 1</B>
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="11"></A>We must first state the subject of our inquiry and the faculty to which 
<A NAME="12"></A>it belongs: its subject is demonstration and the faculty that carries it 
<A NAME="13"></A>out demonstrative science. We must next define a premiss, a term, and a 
<A NAME="14"></A>syllogism, and the nature of a perfect and of an imperfect syllogism; and 
<A NAME="15"></A>after that, the inclusion or noninclusion of one term in another as in 
<A NAME="16"></A>a whole, and what we mean by predicating one term of all, or none, of 
<A NAME="17"></A>another.
<A NAME="18"></A><BR><BR>A premiss then is a sentence affirming or denying one thing of 
<A NAME="19"></A>another. This is either universal or particular or indefinite. By universal 
<A NAME="20"></A>I mean the statement that something belongs to all or none of something 
<A NAME="21"></A>else; by particular that it belongs to some or not to some or not to all; 
<A NAME="22"></A>by indefinite that it does or does not belong, without any mark to show 
<A NAME="23"></A>whether it is universal or particular, e.g. 'contraries are subjects of 
<A NAME="24"></A>the same science', or 'pleasure is not good'. The demonstrative premiss 
<A NAME="25"></A>differs from the dialectical, because the demonstrative premiss is the 
<A NAME="26"></A>assertion of one of two contradictory statements (the demonstrator does 
<A NAME="27"></A>not ask for his premiss, but lays it down), whereas the dialectical premiss 
<A NAME="28"></A>depends on the adversary's choice between two contradictories. But this 
<A NAME="29"></A>will make no difference to the production of a syllogism in either case; 
<A NAME="30"></A>for both the demonstrator and the dialectician argue syllogistically after 
<A NAME="31"></A>stating that something does or does not belong to something else. Therefore 
<A NAME="32"></A>a syllogistic premiss without qualification will be an affirmation or denial 
<A NAME="33"></A>of something concerning something else in the way we have described; it 
<A NAME="34"></A>will be demonstrative, if it is true and obtained through the first principles 
<A NAME="35"></A>of its science; while a dialectical premiss is the giving of a choice between 
<A NAME="36"></A>two contradictories, when a man is proceeding by question, but when he 
<A NAME="37"></A>is syllogizing it is the assertion of that which is apparent and generally 
<A NAME="38"></A>admitted, as has been said in the Topics. The nature then of a premiss 
<A NAME="39"></A>and the difference between syllogistic, demonstrative, and dialectical 
<A NAME="40"></A>premisses, may be taken as sufficiently defined by us in relation to our 
<A NAME="41"></A>present need, but will be stated accurately in the sequel.
<A NAME="42"></A><BR><BR>I call that a term into which the premiss is resolved, i.e. both 
<A NAME="43"></A>the predicate and that of which it is predicated, 'being' being added and 
<A NAME="44"></A>'not being' removed, or vice versa.
<A NAME="45"></A><BR><BR>A syllogism is discourse in which, certain things being stated, 
<A NAME="46"></A>something other than what is stated follows of necessity from their being 
<A NAME="47"></A>so. I mean by the last phrase that they produce the consequence, and by 
<A NAME="48"></A>this, that no further term is required from without in order to make the 
<A NAME="49"></A>consequence necessary.
<A NAME="50"></A><BR><BR>I call that a perfect syllogism which needs nothing other than 
<A NAME="51"></A>what has been stated to make plain what necessarily follows; a syllogism 
<A NAME="52"></A>is imperfect, if it needs either one or more propositions, which are indeed 
<A NAME="53"></A>the necessary consequences of the terms set down, but have not been expressly 
<A NAME="54"></A>stated as premisses.
<A NAME="55"></A><BR><BR>That one term should be included in another as in a whole is the 
<A NAME="56"></A>same as for the other to be predicated of all of the first. And we say 
<A NAME="57"></A>that one term is predicated of all of another, whenever no instance of 
<A NAME="58"></A>the subject can be found of which the other term cannot be asserted: 'to 
<A NAME="59"></A>be predicated of none' must be understood in the same 
<A NAME="60"></A>way.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="61"></A><B>Part 2</B>

<A NAME="62"></A><BR><BR>Every premiss states that something either is or must be or may 
<A NAME="63"></A>be the attribute of something else; of premisses of these three kinds some 
<A NAME="64"></A>are affirmative, others negative, in respect of each of the three modes 
<A NAME="65"></A>of attribution; again some affirmative and negative premisses are universal, 
<A NAME="66"></A>others particular, others indefinite. It is necessary then that in universal 
<A NAME="67"></A>attribution the terms of the negative premiss should be convertible, e.g. 
<A NAME="68"></A>if no pleasure is good, then no good will be pleasure; the terms of the 
<A NAME="69"></A>affirmative must be convertible, not however, universally, but in part, 
<A NAME="70"></A>e.g. if every pleasure,is good, some good must be pleasure; the particular 
<A NAME="71"></A>affirmative must convert in part (for if some pleasure is good, then some 
<A NAME="72"></A>good will be pleasure); but the particular negative need not convert, for 
<A NAME="73"></A>if some animal is not man, it does not follow that some man is not 
<A NAME="74"></A>animal.
<A NAME="75"></A><BR><BR>First then take a universal negative with the terms A and B. If 
<A NAME="76"></A>no B is A, neither can any A be B. For if some A (say C) were B, it would 
<A NAME="77"></A>not be true that no B is A; for C is a B. But if every B is A then some 
<A NAME="78"></A>A is B. For if no A were B, then no B could be A. But we assumed that every 
<A NAME="79"></A>B is A. Similarly too, if the premiss is particular. For if some B is A, 
<A NAME="80"></A>then some of the As must be B. For if none were, then no B would be A. 
<A NAME="81"></A>But if some B is not A, there is no necessity that some of the As should 
<A NAME="82"></A>not be B; e.g. let B stand for animal and A for man. Not every animal is 
<A NAME="83"></A>a man; but every man is an animal.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="84"></A><B>Part 3</B>

<A NAME="85"></A><BR><BR>The same manner of conversion will hold good also in respect of 
<A NAME="86"></A>necessary premisses. The universal negative converts universally; each 
<A NAME="87"></A>of the affirmatives converts into a particular. If it is necessary that 
<A NAME="88"></A>no B is A, it is necessary also that no A is B. For if it is possible that 
<A NAME="89"></A>some A is B, it would be possible also that some B is A. If all or some 
<A NAME="90"></A>B is A of necessity, it is necessary also that some A is B: for if there 
<A NAME="91"></A>were no necessity, neither would some of the Bs be A necessarily. But the 
<A NAME="92"></A>particular negative does not convert, for the same reason which we have 
<A NAME="93"></A>already stated.
<A NAME="94"></A><BR><BR>In respect of possible premisses, since possibility is used in 
<A NAME="95"></A>several senses (for we say that what is necessary and what is not necessary 
<A NAME="96"></A>and what is potential is possible), affirmative statements will all convert 
<A NAME="97"></A>in a manner similar to those described. For if it is possible that all 
<A NAME="98"></A>or some B is A, it will be possible that some A is B. For if that were 
<A NAME="99"></A>not possible, then no B could possibly be A. This has been already proved. 
<A NAME="100"></A>But in negative statements the case is different. Whatever is said to be 
<A NAME="101"></A>possible, either because B necessarily is A, or because B is not necessarily 
<A NAME="102"></A>A, admits of conversion like other negative statements, e.g. if one should 
<A NAME="103"></A>say, it is possible that man is not horse, or that no garment is white. 
<A NAME="104"></A>For in the former case the one term necessarily does not belong to the 
<A NAME="105"></A>other; in the latter there is no necessity that it should: and the premiss 
<A NAME="106"></A>converts like other negative statements. For if it is possible for no man 
<A NAME="107"></A>to be a horse, it is also admissible for no horse to be a man; and if it 
<A NAME="108"></A>is admissible for no garment to be white, it is also admissible for nothing 
<A NAME="109"></A>white to be a garment. For if any white thing must be a garment, then some 
<A NAME="110"></A>garment will necessarily be white. This has been already proved. The particular 
<A NAME="111"></A>negative also must be treated like those dealt with above. But if anything 
<A NAME="112"></A>is said to be possible because it is the general rule and natural (and 
<A NAME="113"></A>it is in this way we define the possible), the negative premisses can no 
<A NAME="114"></A>longer be converted like the simple negatives; the universal negative premiss 
<A NAME="115"></A>does not convert, and the particular does. This will be plain when we speak 
<A NAME="116"></A>about the possible. At present we may take this much as clear in addition 
<A NAME="117"></A>to what has been said: the statement that it is possible that no B is A 
<A NAME="118"></A>or some B is not A is affirmative in form: for the expression 'is possible' 
<A NAME="119"></A>ranks along with 'is', and 'is' makes an affirmation always and in every 
<A NAME="120"></A>case, whatever the terms to which it is added, in predication, e.g. 'it 
<A NAME="121"></A>is not-good' or 'it is not-white' or in a word 'it is not-this'. But this 
<A NAME="122"></A>also will be proved in the sequel. In conversion these premisses will behave 
<A NAME="123"></A>like the other affirmative propositions.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="124"></A><B>Part 4</B>

<A NAME="125"></A><BR><BR>After these distinctions we now state by what means, when, and 
<A NAME="126"></A>how every syllogism is produced; subsequently we must speak of demonstration. 
<A NAME="127"></A>Syllogism should be discussed before demonstration because syllogism is 
<A NAME="128"></A>the general: the demonstration is a sort of syllogism, but not every syllogism 
<A NAME="129"></A>is a demonstration.
<A NAME="130"></A><BR><BR>Whenever three terms are so related to one another that the last 
<A NAME="131"></A>is contained in the middle as in a whole, and the middle is either contained 
<A NAME="132"></A>in, or excluded from, the first as in or from a whole, the extremes must 
<A NAME="133"></A>be related by a perfect syllogism. I call that term middle which is itself 
<A NAME="134"></A>contained in another and contains another in itself: in position also this 
<A NAME="135"></A>comes in the middle. By extremes I mean both that term which is itself 
<A NAME="136"></A>contained in another and that in which another is contained. If A is predicated 
<A NAME="137"></A>of all B, and B of all C, A must be predicated of all C: we have already 
<A NAME="138"></A>explained what we mean by 'predicated of all'. Similarly also, if A is 
<A NAME="139"></A>predicated of no B, and B of all C, it is necessary that no C will be 
<A NAME="140"></A>A.
<A NAME="141"></A><BR><BR>But if the first term belongs to all the middle, but the middle 
<A NAME="142"></A>to none of the last term, there will be no syllogism in respect of the 
<A NAME="143"></A>extremes; for nothing necessary follows from the terms being so related; 
<A NAME="144"></A>for it is possible that the first should belong either to all or to none 
<A NAME="145"></A>of the last, so that neither a particular nor a universal conclusion is 
<A NAME="146"></A>necessary. But if there is no necessary consequence, there cannot be a 
<A NAME="147"></A>syllogism by means of these premisses. As an example of a universal affirmative 
<A NAME="148"></A>relation between the extremes we may take the terms animal, man, horse; 
<A NAME="149"></A>of a universal negative relation, the terms animal, man, stone. Nor again 
<A NAME="150"></A>can syllogism be formed when neither the first term belongs to any of the 
<A NAME="151"></A>middle, nor the middle to any of the last. As an example of a positive 
<A NAME="152"></A>relation between the extremes take the terms science, line, medicine: of 
<A NAME="153"></A>a negative relation science, line, unit.
<A NAME="154"></A><BR><BR>If then the terms are universally related, it is clear in this 
<A NAME="155"></A>figure when a syllogism will be possible and when not, and that if a syllogism 
<A NAME="156"></A>is possible the terms must be related as described, and if they are so 
<A NAME="157"></A>related there will be a syllogism.
<A NAME="158"></A><BR><BR>But if one term is related universally, the other in part only, 
<A NAME="159"></A>to its subject, there must be a perfect syllogism whenever universality 
<A NAME="160"></A>is posited with reference to the major term either affirmatively or negatively, 
<A NAME="161"></A>and particularity with reference to the minor term affirmatively: but whenever 
<A NAME="162"></A>the universality is posited in relation to the minor term, or the terms 
<A NAME="163"></A>are related in any other way, a syllogism is impossible. I call that term 
<A NAME="164"></A>the major in which the middle is contained and that term the minor which 
<A NAME="165"></A>comes under the middle. Let all B be A and some C be B. Then if 'predicated 
<A NAME="166"></A>of all' means what was said above, it is necessary that some C is A. And 
<A NAME="167"></A>if no B is A but some C is B, it is necessary that some C is not A. The 
<A NAME="168"></A>meaning of 'predicated of none' has also been defined. So there will be 
<A NAME="169"></A>a perfect syllogism. This holds good also if the premiss BC should be indefinite, 
<A NAME="170"></A>provided that it is affirmative: for we shall have the same syllogism whether 
<A NAME="171"></A>the premiss is indefinite or particular.
<A NAME="172"></A><BR><BR>But if the universality is posited with respect to the minor term 
<A NAME="173"></A>either affirmatively or negatively, a syllogism will not be possible, whether 
<A NAME="174"></A>the major premiss is positive or negative, indefinite or particular: e.g. 
<A NAME="175"></A>if some B is or is not A, and all C is B. As an example of a positive relation 
<A NAME="176"></A>between the extremes take the terms good, state, wisdom: of a negative 
<A NAME="177"></A>relation, good, state, ignorance. Again if no C is B, but some B is or 
<A NAME="178"></A>is not A or not every B is A, there cannot be a syllogism. Take the terms 
<A NAME="179"></A>white, horse, swan: white, horse, raven. The same terms may be taken also 
<A NAME="180"></A>if the premiss BA is indefinite.
<A NAME="181"></A><BR><BR>Nor when the major premiss is universal, whether affirmative or 
<A NAME="182"></A>negative, and the minor premiss is negative and particular, can there be 
<A NAME="183"></A>a syllogism, whether the minor premiss be indefinite or particular: e.g. 
<A NAME="184"></A>if all B is A and some C is not B, or if not all C is B. For the major 
<A NAME="185"></A>term may be predicable both of all and of none of the minor, to some of 
<A NAME="186"></A>which the middle term cannot be attributed. Suppose the terms are animal, 
<A NAME="187"></A>man, white: next take some of the white things of which man is not predicated-swan 
<A NAME="188"></A>and snow: animal is predicated of all of the one, but of none of the other. 
<A NAME="189"></A>Consequently there cannot be a syllogism. Again let no B be A, but let 
<A NAME="190"></A>some C not be B. Take the terms inanimate, man, white: then take some white 
<A NAME="191"></A>things of which man is not predicated-swan and snow: the term inanimate 
<A NAME="192"></A>is predicated of all of the one, of none of the other.
<A NAME="193"></A><BR><BR>Further since it is indefinite to say some C is not B, and it is 
<A NAME="194"></A>true that some C is not B, whether no C is B, or not all C is B, and since 
<A NAME="195"></A>if terms are assumed such that no C is B, no syllogism follows (this has 
<A NAME="196"></A>already been stated) it is clear that this arrangement of terms will not 
<A NAME="197"></A>afford a syllogism: otherwise one would have been possible with a universal 
<A NAME="198"></A>negative minor premiss. A similar proof may also be given if the universal 
<A NAME="199"></A>premiss is negative.
<A NAME="200"></A><BR><BR>Nor can there in any way be a syllogism if both the relations of 
<A NAME="201"></A>subject and predicate are particular, either positively or negatively, 
<A NAME="202"></A>or the one negative and the other affirmative, or one indefinite and the 
<A NAME="203"></A>other definite, or both indefinite. Terms common to all the above are animal, 
<A NAME="204"></A>white, horse: animal, white, stone.
<A NAME="205"></A><BR><BR>It is clear then from what has been said that if there is a syllogism 
<A NAME="206"></A>in this figure with a particular conclusion, the terms must be related 
<A NAME="207"></A>as we have stated: if they are related otherwise, no syllogism is possible 
<A NAME="208"></A>anyhow. It is evident also that all the syllogisms in this figure are perfect 
<A NAME="209"></A>(for they are all completed by means of the premisses originally taken) 
<A NAME="210"></A>and that all conclusions are proved by this figure, viz. universal and 
<A NAME="211"></A>particular, affirmative and negative. Such a figure I call the 
<A NAME="212"></A>first.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="213"></A><B>Part 5</B>

<A NAME="214"></A><BR><BR>Whenever the same thing belongs to all of one subject, and to none 
<A NAME="215"></A>of another, or to all of each subject or to none of either, I call such 
<A NAME="216"></A>a figure the second; by middle term in it I mean that which is predicated 
<A NAME="217"></A>of both subjects, by extremes the terms of which this is said, by major 
<A NAME="218"></A>extreme that which lies near the middle, by minor that which is further 
<A NAME="219"></A>away from the middle. The middle term stands outside the extremes, and 
<A NAME="220"></A>is first in position. A syllogism cannot be perfect anyhow in this figure, 
<A NAME="221"></A>but it may be valid whether the terms are related universally or 
<A NAME="222"></A>not.
<A NAME="223"></A><BR><BR>If then the terms are related universally a syllogism will be possible, 
<A NAME="224"></A>whenever the middle belongs to all of one subject and to none of another 
<A NAME="225"></A>(it does not matter which has the negative relation), but in no other way. 
<A NAME="226"></A>Let M be predicated of no N, but of all O. Since, then, the negative relation 
<A NAME="227"></A>is convertible, N will belong to no M: but M was assumed to belong to all 
<A NAME="228"></A>O: consequently N will belong to no O. This has already been proved. Again 
<A NAME="229"></A>if M belongs to all N, but to no O, then N will belong to no O. For if 
<A NAME="230"></A>M belongs to no O, O belongs to no M: but M (as was said) belongs to all 
<A NAME="231"></A>N: O then will belong to no N: for the first figure has again been formed. 
<A NAME="232"></A>But since the negative relation is convertible, N will belong to no O. 
<A NAME="233"></A>Thus it will be the same syllogism that proves both 
<A NAME="234"></A>conclusions.
<A NAME="235"></A><BR><BR>It is possible to prove these results also by reductio ad 
<A NAME="236"></A>impossibile.
<A NAME="237"></A><BR><BR>It is clear then that a syllogism is formed when the terms are 
<A NAME="238"></A>so related, but not a perfect syllogism; for necessity is not perfectly 
<A NAME="239"></A>established merely from the original premisses; others also are 
<A NAME="240"></A>needed.
<A NAME="241"></A><BR><BR>But if M is predicated of every N and O, there cannot be a syllogism. 
<A NAME="242"></A>Terms to illustrate a positive relation between the extremes are substance, 
<A NAME="243"></A>animal, man; a negative relation, substance, animal, number-substance being 
<A NAME="244"></A>the middle term.
<A NAME="245"></A><BR><BR>Nor is a syllogism possible when M is predicated neither of any 
<A NAME="246"></A>N nor of any O. Terms to illustrate a positive relation are line, animal, 
<A NAME="247"></A>man: a negative relation, line, animal, stone.
<A NAME="248"></A><BR><BR>It is clear then that if a syllogism is formed when the terms are 
<A NAME="249"></A>universally related, the terms must be related as we stated at the outset: 
<A NAME="250"></A>for if they are otherwise related no necessary consequence 
<A NAME="251"></A>follows.
<A NAME="252"></A><BR><BR>If the middle term is related universally to one of the extremes, 
<A NAME="253"></A>a particular negative syllogism must result whenever the middle term is 
<A NAME="254"></A>related universally to the major whether positively or negatively, and 
<A NAME="255"></A>particularly to the minor and in a manner opposite to that of the universal 
<A NAME="256"></A>statement: by 'an opposite manner' I mean, if the universal statement is 
<A NAME="257"></A>negative, the particular is affirmative: if the universal is affirmative, 
<A NAME="258"></A>the particular is negative. For if M belongs to no N, but to some O, it 
<A NAME="259"></A>is necessary that N does not belong to some O. For since the negative statement 
<A NAME="260"></A>is convertible, N will belong to no M: but M was admitted to belong to 
<A NAME="261"></A>some O: therefore N will not belong to some O: for the result is reached 
<A NAME="262"></A>by means of the first figure. Again if M belongs to all N, but not to some 
<A NAME="263"></A>O, it is necessary that N does not belong to some O: for if N belongs to 
<A NAME="264"></A>all O, and M is predicated also of all N, M must belong to all O: but we 
<A NAME="265"></A>assumed that M does not belong to some O. And if M belongs to all N but 
<A NAME="266"></A>not to all O, we shall conclude that N does not belong to all O: the proof 
<A NAME="267"></A>is the same as the above. But if M is predicated of all O, but not of all 
<A NAME="268"></A>N, there will be no syllogism. Take the terms animal, substance, raven; 
<A NAME="269"></A>animal, white, raven. Nor will there be a conclusion when M is predicated 
<A NAME="270"></A>of no O, but of some N. Terms to illustrate a positive relation between 
<A NAME="271"></A>the extremes are animal, substance, unit: a negative relation, animal, 
<A NAME="272"></A>substance, science.
<A NAME="273"></A><BR><BR>If then the universal statement is opposed to the particular, we 
<A NAME="274"></A>have stated when a syllogism will be possible and when not: but if the 
<A NAME="275"></A>premisses are similar in form, I mean both negative or both affirmative, 
<A NAME="276"></A>a syllogism will not be possible anyhow. First let them be negative, and 
<A NAME="277"></A>let the major premiss be universal, e.g. let M belong to no N, and not 
<A NAME="278"></A>to some O. It is possible then for N to belong either to all O or to no 
<A NAME="279"></A>O. Terms to illustrate the negative relation are black, snow, animal. But 
<A NAME="280"></A>it is not possible to find terms of which the extremes are related positively 
<A NAME="281"></A>and universally, if M belongs to some O, and does not belong to some O. 
<A NAME="282"></A>For if N belonged to all O, but M to no N, then M would belong to no O: 
<A NAME="283"></A>but we assumed that it belongs to some O. In this way then it is not admissible 
<A NAME="284"></A>to take terms: our point must be proved from the indefinite nature of the 
<A NAME="285"></A>particular statement. For since it is true that M does not belong to some 
<A NAME="286"></A>O, even if it belongs to no O, and since if it belongs to no O a syllogism 
<A NAME="287"></A>is (as we have seen) not possible, clearly it will not be possible now 
<A NAME="288"></A>either.
<A NAME="289"></A><BR><BR>Again let the premisses be affirmative, and let the major premiss 
<A NAME="290"></A>as before be universal, e.g. let M belong to all N and to some O. It is 
<A NAME="291"></A>possible then for N to belong to all O or to no O. Terms to illustrate 
<A NAME="292"></A>the negative relation are white, swan, stone. But it is not possible to 
<A NAME="293"></A>take terms to illustrate the universal affirmative relation, for the reason 
<A NAME="294"></A>already stated: the point must be proved from the indefinite nature of 
<A NAME="295"></A>the particular statement. But if the minor premiss is universal, and M 
<A NAME="296"></A>belongs to no O, and not to some N, it is possible for N to belong either 
<A NAME="297"></A>to all O or to no O. Terms for the positive relation are white, animal, 
<A NAME="298"></A>raven: for the negative relation, white, stone, raven. If the premisses 
<A NAME="299"></A>are affirmative, terms for the negative relation are white, animal, snow; 
<A NAME="300"></A>for the positive relation, white, animal, swan. Evidently then, whenever 
<A NAME="301"></A>the premisses are similar in form, and one is universal, the other particular, 
<A NAME="302"></A>a syllogism can, not be formed anyhow. Nor is one possible if the middle 
<A NAME="303"></A>term belongs to some of each of the extremes, or does not belong to some 
<A NAME="304"></A>of either, or belongs to some of the one, not to some of the other, or 
<A NAME="305"></A>belongs to neither universally, or is related to them indefinitely. Common 
<A NAME="306"></A>terms for all the above are white, animal, man: white, animal, inanimate. 
<A NAME="307"></A>It is clear then from what has been said that if the terms are related 
<A NAME="308"></A>to one another in the way stated, a syllogism results of necessity; and 
<A NAME="309"></A>if there is a syllogism, the terms must be so related. But it is evident 
<A NAME="310"></A>also that all the syllogisms in this figure are imperfect: for all are 
<A NAME="311"></A>made perfect by certain supplementary statements, which either are contained 
<A NAME="312"></A>in the terms of necessity or are assumed as hypotheses, i.e. when we prove 
<A NAME="313"></A>per impossibile. And it is evident that an affirmative conclusion is not 
<A NAME="314"></A>attained by means of this figure, but all are negative, whether universal 
<A NAME="315"></A>or particular.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="316"></A><B>Part 6</B>

<A NAME="317"></A><BR><BR>But if one term belongs to all, and another to none, of a third, 
<A NAME="318"></A>or if both belong to all, or to none, of it, I call such a figure the third; 
<A NAME="319"></A>by middle term in it I mean that of which both the predicates are predicated, 
<A NAME="320"></A>by extremes I mean the predicates, by the major extreme that which is further 
<A NAME="321"></A>from the middle, by the minor that which is nearer to it. The middle term 
<A NAME="322"></A>stands outside the extremes, and is last in position. A syllogism cannot 
<A NAME="323"></A>be perfect in this figure either, but it may be valid whether the terms 
<A NAME="324"></A>are related universally or not to the middle term.
<A NAME="325"></A><BR><BR>If they are universal, whenever both P and R belong to S, it follows 
<A NAME="326"></A>that P will necessarily belong to some R. For, since the affirmative statement 
<A NAME="327"></A>is convertible, S will belong to some R: consequently since P belongs to 
<A NAME="328"></A>all S, and S to some R, P must belong to some R: for a syllogism in the 
<A NAME="329"></A>first figure is produced. It is possible to demonstrate this also per impossibile 
<A NAME="330"></A>and by exposition. For if both P and R belong to all S, should one of the 
<A NAME="331"></A>Ss, e.g. N, be taken, both P and R will belong to this, and thus P will 
<A NAME="332"></A>belong to some R.
<A NAME="333"></A><BR><BR>If R belongs to all S, and P to no S, there will be a syllogism 
<A NAME="334"></A>to prove that P will necessarily not belong to some R. This may be demonstrated 
<A NAME="335"></A>in the same way as before by converting the premiss RS. It might be proved 
<A NAME="336"></A>also per impossibile, as in the former cases. But if R belongs to no S, 
<A NAME="337"></A>P to all S, there will be no syllogism. Terms for the positive relation 
<A NAME="338"></A>are animal, horse, man: for the negative relation animal, inanimate, 
<A NAME="339"></A>man.
<A NAME="340"></A><BR><BR>Nor can there be a syllogism when both terms are asserted of no 
<A NAME="341"></A>S. Terms for the positive relation are animal, horse, inanimate; for the 
<A NAME="342"></A>negative relation man, horse, inanimate-inanimate being the middle 
<A NAME="343"></A>term.
<A NAME="344"></A><BR><BR>It is clear then in this figure also when a syllogism will be possible 
<A NAME="345"></A>and when not, if the terms are related universally. For whenever both the 
<A NAME="346"></A>terms are affirmative, there will be a syllogism to prove that one extreme 
<A NAME="347"></A>belongs to some of the other; but when they are negative, no syllogism 
<A NAME="348"></A>will be possible. But when one is negative, the other affirmative, if the 
<A NAME="349"></A>major is negative, the minor affirmative, there will be a syllogism to 
<A NAME="350"></A>prove that the one extreme does not belong to some of the other: but if 
<A NAME="351"></A>the relation is reversed, no syllogism will be possible. If one term is 
<A NAME="352"></A>related universally to the middle, the other in part only, when both are 
<A NAME="353"></A>affirmative there must be a syllogism, no matter which of the premisses 
<A NAME="354"></A>is universal. For if R belongs to all S, P to some S, P must belong to 
<A NAME="355"></A>some R. For since the affirmative statement is convertible S will belong 
<A NAME="356"></A>to some P: consequently since R belongs to all S, and S to some P, R must 
<A NAME="357"></A>also belong to some P: therefore P must belong to some 
<A NAME="358"></A>R.
<A NAME="359"></A><BR><BR>Again if R belongs to some S, and P to all S, P must belong to 
<A NAME="360"></A>some R. This may be demonstrated in the same way as the preceding. And 
<A NAME="361"></A>it is possible to demonstrate it also per impossibile and by exposition, 
<A NAME="362"></A>as in the former cases. But if one term is affirmative, the other negative, 
<A NAME="363"></A>and if the affirmative is universal, a syllogism will be possible whenever 
<A NAME="364"></A>the minor term is affirmative. For if R belongs to all S, but P does not 
<A NAME="365"></A>belong to some S, it is necessary that P does not belong to some R. For 
<A NAME="366"></A>if P belongs to all R, and R belongs to all S, then P will belong to all 
<A NAME="367"></A>S: but we assumed that it did not. Proof is possible also without reduction 
<A NAME="368"></A>ad impossibile, if one of the Ss be taken to which P does not 
<A NAME="369"></A>belong.
<A NAME="370"></A><BR><BR>But whenever the major is affirmative, no syllogism will be possible, 
<A NAME="371"></A>e.g. if P belongs to all S and R does not belong to some S. Terms for the 
<A NAME="372"></A>universal affirmative relation are animate, man, animal. For the universal 
<A NAME="373"></A>negative relation it is not possible to get terms, if R belongs to some 
<A NAME="374"></A>S, and does not belong to some S. For if P belongs to all S, and R to some 
<A NAME="375"></A>S, then P will belong to some R: but we assumed that it belongs to no R. 
<A NAME="376"></A>We must put the matter as before.' Since the expression 'it does not belong 
<A NAME="377"></A>to some' is indefinite, it may be used truly of that also which belongs 
<A NAME="378"></A>to none. But if R belongs to no S, no syllogism is possible, as has been 
<A NAME="379"></A>shown. Clearly then no syllogism will be possible here.
<A NAME="380"></A><BR><BR>But if the negative term is universal, whenever the major is negative 
<A NAME="381"></A>and the minor affirmative there will be a syllogism. For if P belongs to 
<A NAME="382"></A>no S, and R belongs to some S, P will not belong to some R: for we shall 
<A NAME="383"></A>have the first figure again, if the premiss RS is converted.
<A NAME="384"></A><BR><BR>But when the minor is negative, there will be no syllogism. Terms 
<A NAME="385"></A>for the positive relation are animal, man, wild: for the negative relation, 
<A NAME="386"></A>animal, science, wild-the middle in both being the term 
<A NAME="387"></A>wild.
<A NAME="388"></A><BR><BR>Nor is a syllogism possible when both are stated in the negative, 
<A NAME="389"></A>but one is universal, the other particular. When the minor is related universally 
<A NAME="390"></A>to the middle, take the terms animal, science, wild; animal, man, wild. 
<A NAME="391"></A>When the major is related universally to the middle, take as terms for 
<A NAME="392"></A>a negative relation raven, snow, white. For a positive relation terms cannot 
<A NAME="393"></A>be found, if R belongs to some S, and does not belong to some S. For if 
<A NAME="394"></A>P belongs to all R, and R to some S, then P belongs to some S: but we assumed 
<A NAME="395"></A>that it belongs to no S. Our point, then, must be proved from the indefinite 
<A NAME="396"></A>nature of the particular statement.
<A NAME="397"></A><BR><BR>Nor is a syllogism possible anyhow, if each of the extremes belongs 
<A NAME="398"></A>to some of the middle or does not belong, or one belongs and the other 
<A NAME="399"></A>does not to some of the middle, or one belongs to some of the middle, the 
<A NAME="400"></A>other not to all, or if the premisses are indefinite. Common terms for 
<A NAME="401"></A>all are animal, man, white: animal, inanimate, white.
<A NAME="402"></A><BR><BR>It is clear then in this figure also when a syllogism will be possible, 
<A NAME="403"></A>and when not; and that if the terms are as stated, a syllogism results 
<A NAME="404"></A>of necessity, and if there is a syllogism, the terms must be so related. 
<A NAME="405"></A>It is clear also that all the syllogisms in this figure are imperfect (for 
<A NAME="406"></A>all are made perfect by certain supplementary assumptions), and that it 
<A NAME="407"></A>will not be possible to reach a universal conclusion by means of this figure, 
<A NAME="408"></A>whether negative or affirmative.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="409"></A><B>Part 7</B>

<A NAME="410"></A><BR><BR>It is evident also that in all the figures, whenever a proper syllogism 
<A NAME="411"></A>does not result, if both the terms are affirmative or negative nothing 
<A NAME="412"></A>necessary follows at all, but if one is affirmative, the other negative, 
<A NAME="413"></A>and if the negative is stated universally, a syllogism always results relating 
<A NAME="414"></A>the minor to the major term, e.g. if A belongs to all or some B, and B 
<A NAME="415"></A>belongs to no C: for if the premisses are converted it is necessary that 
<A NAME="416"></A>C does not belong to some A. Similarly also in the other figures: a syllogism 
<A NAME="417"></A>always results by means of conversion. It is evident also that the substitution 
<A NAME="418"></A>of an indefinite for a particular affirmative will effect the same syllogism 
<A NAME="419"></A>in all the figures.
<A NAME="420"></A><BR><BR>It is clear too that all the imperfect syllogisms are made perfect 
<A NAME="421"></A>by means of the first figure. For all are brought to a conclusion either 
<A NAME="422"></A>ostensively or per impossibile. In both ways the first figure is formed: 
<A NAME="423"></A>if they are made perfect ostensively, because (as we saw) all are brought 
<A NAME="424"></A>to a conclusion by means of conversion, and conversion produces the first 
<A NAME="425"></A>figure: if they are proved per impossibile, because on the assumption of 
<A NAME="426"></A>the false statement the syllogism comes about by means of the first figure, 
<A NAME="427"></A>e.g. in the last figure, if A and B belong to all C, it follows that A 
<A NAME="428"></A>belongs to some B: for if A belonged to no B, and B belongs to all C, A 
<A NAME="429"></A>would belong to no C: but (as we stated) it belongs to all C. Similarly 
<A NAME="430"></A>also with the rest.
<A NAME="431"></A><BR><BR>It is possible also to reduce all syllogisms to the universal syllogisms 
<A NAME="432"></A>in the first figure. Those in the second figure are clearly made perfect 
<A NAME="433"></A>by these, though not all in the same way; the universal syllogisms are 
<A NAME="434"></A>made perfect by converting the negative premiss, each of the particular 
<A NAME="435"></A>syllogisms by reductio ad impossibile. In the first figure particular syllogisms 
<A NAME="436"></A>are indeed made perfect by themselves, but it is possible also to prove 
<A NAME="437"></A>them by means of the second figure, reducing them ad impossibile, e.g. 
<A NAME="438"></A>if A belongs to all B, and B to some C, it follows that A belongs to some 
<A NAME="439"></A>C. For if it belonged to no C, and belongs to all B, then B will belong 
<A NAME="440"></A>to no C: this we know by means of the second figure. Similarly also demonstration 
<A NAME="441"></A>will be possible in the case of the negative. For if A belongs to no B, 
<A NAME="442"></A>and B belongs to some C, A will not belong to some C: for if it belonged 
<A NAME="443"></A>to all C, and belongs to no B, then B will belong to no C: and this (as 
<A NAME="444"></A>we saw) is the middle figure. Consequently, since all syllogisms in the 
<A NAME="445"></A>middle figure can be reduced to universal syllogisms in the first figure, 
<A NAME="446"></A>and since particular syllogisms in the first figure can be reduced to syllogisms 
<A NAME="447"></A>in the middle figure, it is clear that particular syllogisms can be reduced 
<A NAME="448"></A>to universal syllogisms in the first figure. Syllogisms in the third figure, 
<A NAME="449"></A>if the terms are universal, are directly made perfect by means of those 
<A NAME="450"></A>syllogisms; but, when one of the premisses is particular, by means of the 
<A NAME="451"></A>particular syllogisms in the first figure: and these (we have seen) may 
<A NAME="452"></A>be reduced to the universal syllogisms in the first figure: consequently 
<A NAME="453"></A>also the particular syllogisms in the third figure may be so reduced. It 
<A NAME="454"></A>is clear then that all syllogisms may be reduced to the universal syllogisms 
<A NAME="455"></A>in the first figure.
<A NAME="456"></A><BR><BR>We have stated then how syllogisms which prove that something belongs 
<A NAME="457"></A>or does not belong to something else are constituted, both how syllogisms 
<A NAME="458"></A>of the same figure are constituted in themselves, and how syllogisms of 
<A NAME="459"></A>different figures are related to one another.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="460"></A><B>Part 8</B>

<A NAME="461"></A><BR><BR>Since there is a difference according as something belongs, necessarily 
<A NAME="462"></A>belongs, or may belong to something else (for many things belong indeed, 
<A NAME="463"></A>but not necessarily, others neither necessarily nor indeed at all, but 
<A NAME="464"></A>it is possible for them to belong), it is clear that there will be different 
<A NAME="465"></A>syllogisms to prove each of these relations, and syllogisms with differently 
<A NAME="466"></A>related terms, one syllogism concluding from what is necessary, another 
<A NAME="467"></A>from what is, a third from what is possible.
<A NAME="468"></A><BR><BR>There is hardly any difference between syllogisms from necessary 
<A NAME="469"></A>premisses and syllogisms from premisses which merely assert. When the terms 
<A NAME="470"></A>are put in the same way, then, whether something belongs or necessarily 
<A NAME="471"></A>belongs (or does not belong) to something else, a syllogism will or will 
<A NAME="472"></A>not result alike in both cases, the only difference being the addition 
<A NAME="473"></A>of the expression 'necessarily' to the terms. For the negative statement 
<A NAME="474"></A>is convertible alike in both cases, and we should give the same account 
<A NAME="475"></A>of the expressions 'to be contained in something as in a whole' and 'to 
<A NAME="476"></A>be predicated of all of something'. With the exceptions to be made below, 
<A NAME="477"></A>the conclusion will be proved to be necessary by means of conversion, in 
<A NAME="478"></A>the same manner as in the case of simple predication. But in the middle 
<A NAME="479"></A>figure when the universal statement is affirmative, and the particular 
<A NAME="480"></A>negative, and again in the third figure when the universal is affirmative 
<A NAME="481"></A>and the particular negative, the demonstration will not take the same form, 
<A NAME="482"></A>but it is necessary by the 'exposition' of a part of the subject of the 
<A NAME="483"></A>particular negative proposition, to which the predicate does not belong, 
<A NAME="484"></A>to make the syllogism in reference to this: with terms so chosen the conclusion 
<A NAME="485"></A>will necessarily follow. But if the relation is necessary in respect of 
<A NAME="486"></A>the part taken, it must hold of some of that term in which this part is 
<A NAME="487"></A>included: for the part taken is just some of that. And each of the resulting 
<A NAME="488"></A>syllogisms is in the appropriate figure.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="489"></A><B>Part 9</B>

<A NAME="490"></A><BR><BR>It happens sometimes also that when one premiss is necessary the 
<A NAME="491"></A>conclusion is necessary, not however when either premiss is necessary, 
<A NAME="492"></A>but only when the major is, e.g. if A is taken as necessarily belonging 
<A NAME="493"></A>or not belonging to B, but B is taken as simply belonging to C: for if 
<A NAME="494"></A>the premisses are taken in this way, A will necessarily belong or not belong 
<A NAME="495"></A>to C. For since necessarily belongs, or does not belong, to every B, and 
<A NAME="496"></A>since C is one of the Bs, it is clear that for C also the positive or the 
<A NAME="497"></A>negative relation to A will hold necessarily. But if the major premiss 
<A NAME="498"></A>is not necessary, but the minor is necessary, the conclusion will not be 
<A NAME="499"></A>necessary. For if it were, it would result both through the first figure 
<A NAME="500"></A>and through the third that A belongs necessarily to some B. But this is 
<A NAME="501"></A>false; for B may be such that it is possible that A should belong to none 
<A NAME="502"></A>of it. Further, an example also makes it clear that the conclusion not 
<A NAME="503"></A>be necessary, e.g. if A were movement, B animal, C man: man is an animal 
<A NAME="504"></A>necessarily, but an animal does not move necessarily, nor does man. Similarly 
<A NAME="505"></A>also if the major premiss is negative; for the proof is the 
<A NAME="506"></A>same.
<A NAME="507"></A><BR><BR>In particular syllogisms, if the universal premiss is necessary, 
<A NAME="508"></A>then the conclusion will be necessary; but if the particular, the conclusion 
<A NAME="509"></A>will not be necessary, whether the universal premiss is negative or affirmative. 
<A NAME="510"></A>First let the universal be necessary, and let A belong to all B necessarily, 
<A NAME="511"></A>but let B simply belong to some C: it is necessary then that A belongs 
<A NAME="512"></A>to some C necessarily: for C falls under B, and A was assumed to belong 
<A NAME="513"></A>necessarily to all B. Similarly also if the syllogism should be negative: 
<A NAME="514"></A>for the proof will be the same. But if the particular premiss is necessary, 
<A NAME="515"></A>the conclusion will not be necessary: for from the denial of such a conclusion 
<A NAME="516"></A>nothing impossible results, just as it does not in the universal syllogisms. 
<A NAME="517"></A>The same is true of negative syllogisms. Try the terms movement, animal, 
<A NAME="518"></A>white.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="519"></A><B>Part 10</B>

<A NAME="520"></A><BR><BR>In the second figure, if the negative premiss is necessary, then 
<A NAME="521"></A>the conclusion will be necessary, but if the affirmative, not necessary. 
<A NAME="522"></A>First let the negative be necessary; let A be possible of no B, and simply 
<A NAME="523"></A>belong to C. Since then the negative statement is convertible, B is possible 
<A NAME="524"></A>of no A. But A belongs to all C; consequently B is possible of no C. For 
<A NAME="525"></A>C falls under A. The same result would be obtained if the minor premiss 
<A NAME="526"></A>were negative: for if A is possible be of no C, C is possible of no A: 
<A NAME="527"></A>but A belongs to all B, consequently C is possible of none of the Bs: for 
<A NAME="528"></A>again we have obtained the first figure. Neither then is B possible of 
<A NAME="529"></A>C: for conversion is possible without modifying the 
<A NAME="530"></A>relation.
<A NAME="531"></A><BR><BR>But if the affirmative premiss is necessary, the conclusion will 
<A NAME="532"></A>not be necessary. Let A belong to all B necessarily, but to no C simply. 
<A NAME="533"></A>If then the negative premiss is converted, the first figure results. But 
<A NAME="534"></A>it has been proved in the case of the first figure that if the negative 
<A NAME="535"></A>major premiss is not necessary the conclusion will not be necessary either. 
<A NAME="536"></A>Therefore the same result will obtain here. Further, if the conclusion 
<A NAME="537"></A>is necessary, it follows that C necessarily does not belong to some A. 
<A NAME="538"></A>For if B necessarily belongs to no C, C will necessarily belong to no B. 
<A NAME="539"></A>But B at any rate must belong to some A, if it is true (as was assumed) 
<A NAME="540"></A>that A necessarily belongs to all B. Consequently it is necessary that 
<A NAME="541"></A>C does not belong to some A. But nothing prevents such an A being taken 
<A NAME="542"></A>that it is possible for C to belong to all of it. Further one might show 
<A NAME="543"></A>by an exposition of terms that the conclusion is not necessary without 
<A NAME="544"></A>qualification, though it is a necessary conclusion from the premisses. 
<A NAME="545"></A>For example let A be animal, B man, C white, and let the premisses be assumed 
<A NAME="546"></A>to correspond to what we had before: it is possible that animal should 
<A NAME="547"></A>belong to nothing white. Man then will not belong to anything white, but 
<A NAME="548"></A>not necessarily: for it is possible for man to be born white, not however 
<A NAME="549"></A>so long as animal belongs to nothing white. Consequently under these conditions 
<A NAME="550"></A>the conclusion will be necessary, but it is not necessary without 
<A NAME="551"></A>qualification.
<A NAME="552"></A><BR><BR>Similar results will obtain also in particular syllogisms. For 
<A NAME="553"></A>whenever the negative premiss is both universal and necessary, then the 
<A NAME="554"></A>conclusion will be necessary: but whenever the affirmative premiss is universal, 
<A NAME="555"></A>the negative particular, the conclusion will not be necessary. First then 
<A NAME="556"></A>let the negative premiss be both universal and necessary: let it be possible 
<A NAME="557"></A>for no B that A should belong to it, and let A simply belong to some C. 
<A NAME="558"></A>Since the negative statement is convertible, it will be possible for no 
<A NAME="559"></A>A that B should belong to it: but A belongs to some C; consequently B necessarily 
<A NAME="560"></A>does not belong to some of the Cs. Again let the affirmative premiss be 
<A NAME="561"></A>both universal and necessary, and let the major premiss be affirmative. 
<A NAME="562"></A>If then A necessarily belongs to all B, but does not belong to some C, 
<A NAME="563"></A>it is clear that B will not belong to some C, but not necessarily. For 
<A NAME="564"></A>the same terms can be used to demonstrate the point, which were used in 
<A NAME="565"></A>the universal syllogisms. Nor again, if the negative statement is necessary 
<A NAME="566"></A>but particular, will the conclusion be necessary. The point can be demonstrated 
<A NAME="567"></A>by means of the same terms.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="568"></A><B>Part 11</B>

<A NAME="569"></A><BR><BR>In the last figure when the terms are related universally to the 
<A NAME="570"></A>middle, and both premisses are affirmative, if one of the two is necessary, 
<A NAME="571"></A>then the conclusion will be necessary. But if one is negative, the other 
<A NAME="572"></A>affirmative, whenever the negative is necessary the conclusion also will 
<A NAME="573"></A>be necessary, but whenever the affirmative is necessary the conclusion 
<A NAME="574"></A>will not be necessary. First let both the premisses be affirmative, and 
<A NAME="575"></A>let A and B belong to all C, and let Ac be necessary. Since then B belongs 
<A NAME="576"></A>to all C, C also will belong to some B, because the universal is convertible 
<A NAME="577"></A>into the particular: consequently if A belongs necessarily to all C, and 
<A NAME="578"></A>C belongs to some B, it is necessary that A should belong to some B also. 
<A NAME="579"></A>For B is under C. The first figure then is formed. A similar proof will 
<A NAME="580"></A>be given also if BC is necessary. For C is convertible with some A: consequently 
<A NAME="581"></A>if B belongs necessarily to all C, it will belong necessarily also to some 
<A NAME="582"></A>A.
<A NAME="583"></A><BR><BR>Again let AC be negative, BC affirmative, and let the negative 
<A NAME="584"></A>premiss be necessary. Since then C is convertible with some B, but A necessarily 
<A NAME="585"></A>belongs to no C, A will necessarily not belong to some B either: for B 
<A NAME="586"></A>is under C. But if the affirmative is necessary, the conclusion will not 
<A NAME="587"></A>be necessary. For suppose BC is affirmative and necessary, while AC is 
<A NAME="588"></A>negative and not necessary. Since then the affirmative is convertible, 
<A NAME="589"></A>C also will belong to some B necessarily: consequently if A belongs to 
<A NAME="590"></A>none of the Cs, while C belongs to some of the Bs, A will not belong to 
<A NAME="591"></A>some of the Bs-but not of necessity; for it has been proved, in the case 
<A NAME="592"></A>of the first figure, that if the negative premiss is not necessary, neither 
<A NAME="593"></A>will the conclusion be necessary. Further, the point may be made clear 
<A NAME="594"></A>by considering the terms. Let the term A be 'good', let that which B signifies 
<A NAME="595"></A>be 'animal', let the term C be 'horse'. It is possible then that the term 
<A NAME="596"></A>good should belong to no horse, and it is necessary that the term animal 
<A NAME="597"></A>should belong to every horse: but it is not necessary that some animal 
<A NAME="598"></A>should not be good, since it is possible for every animal to be good. Or 
<A NAME="599"></A>if that is not possible, take as the term 'awake' or 'asleep': for every 
<A NAME="600"></A>animal can accept these.
<A NAME="601"></A><BR><BR>If, then, the premisses are universal, we have stated when the 
<A NAME="602"></A>conclusion will be necessary. But if one premiss is universal, the other 
<A NAME="603"></A>particular, and if both are affirmative, whenever the universal is necessary 
<A NAME="604"></A>the conclusion also must be necessary. The demonstration is the same as 
<A NAME="605"></A>before; for the particular affirmative also is convertible. If then it 
<A NAME="606"></A>is necessary that B should belong to all C, and A falls under C, it is 
<A NAME="607"></A>necessary that B should belong to some A. But if B must belong to some 
<A NAME="608"></A>A, then A must belong to some B: for conversion is possible. Similarly 
<A NAME="609"></A>also if AC should be necessary and universal: for B falls under C. But 
<A NAME="610"></A>if the particular premiss is necessary, the conclusion will not be necessary. 
<A NAME="611"></A>Let the premiss BC be both particular and necessary, and let A belong to 
<A NAME="612"></A>all C, not however necessarily. If the proposition BC is converted the 
<A NAME="613"></A>first figure is formed, and the universal premiss is not necessary, but 
<A NAME="614"></A>the particular is necessary. But when the premisses were thus, the conclusion 
<A NAME="615"></A>(as we proved was not necessary: consequently it is not here either. Further, 
<A NAME="616"></A>the point is clear if we look at the terms. Let A be waking, B biped, and 
<A NAME="617"></A>C animal. It is necessary that B should belong to some C, but it is possible 
<A NAME="618"></A>for A to belong to C, and that A should belong to B is not necessary. For 
<A NAME="619"></A>there is no necessity that some biped should be asleep or awake. Similarly 
<A NAME="620"></A>and by means of the same terms proof can be made, should the proposition 
<A NAME="621"></A>Ac be both particular and necessary.
<A NAME="622"></A><BR><BR>But if one premiss is affirmative, the other negative, whenever 
<A NAME="623"></A>the universal is both negative and necessary the conclusion also will be 
<A NAME="624"></A>necessary. For if it is not possible that A should belong to any C, but 
<A NAME="625"></A>B belongs to some C, it is necessary that A should not belong to some B. 
<A NAME="626"></A>But whenever the affirmative proposition is necessary, whether universal 
<A NAME="627"></A>or particular, or the negative is particular, the conclusion will not be 
<A NAME="628"></A>necessary. The proof of this by reduction will be the same as before; but 
<A NAME="629"></A>if terms are wanted, when the universal affirmative is necessary, take 
<A NAME="630"></A>the terms 'waking'-'animal'-'man', 'man' being middle, and when the affirmative 
<A NAME="631"></A>is particular and necessary, take the terms 'waking'-'animal'-'white': 
<A NAME="632"></A>for it is necessary that animal should belong to some white thing, but 
<A NAME="633"></A>it is possible that waking should belong to none, and it is not necessary 
<A NAME="634"></A>that waking should not belong to some animal. But when the negative proposition 
<A NAME="635"></A>being particular is necessary, take the terms 'biped', 'moving', 'animal', 
<A NAME="636"></A>'animal' being middle.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="637"></A><B>Part 12</B>

<A NAME="638"></A><BR><BR>It is clear then that a simple conclusion is not reached unless 
<A NAME="639"></A>both premisses are simple assertions, but a necessary conclusion is possible 
<A NAME="640"></A>although one only of the premisses is necessary. But in both cases, whether 
<A NAME="641"></A>the syllogisms are affirmative or negative, it is necessary that one premiss 
<A NAME="642"></A>should be similar to the conclusion. I mean by 'similar', if the conclusion 
<A NAME="643"></A>is a simple assertion, the premiss must be simple; if the conclusion is 
<A NAME="644"></A>necessary, the premiss must be necessary. Consequently this also is clear, 
<A NAME="645"></A>that the conclusion will be neither necessary nor simple unless a necessary 
<A NAME="646"></A>or simple premiss is assumed.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="647"></A><B>Part 13</B>

<A NAME="648"></A><BR><BR>Perhaps enough has been said about the proof of necessity, how 
<A NAME="649"></A>it comes about and how it differs from the proof of a simple statement. 
<A NAME="650"></A>We proceed to discuss that which is possible, when and how and by what 
<A NAME="651"></A>means it can be proved. I use the terms 'to be possible' and 'the possible' 
<A NAME="652"></A>of that which is not necessary but, being assumed, results in nothing impossible. 
<A NAME="653"></A>We say indeed ambiguously of the necessary that it is possible. But that 
<A NAME="654"></A>my definition of the possible is correct is clear from the phrases by which 
<A NAME="655"></A>we deny or on the contrary affirm possibility. For the expressions 'it 
<A NAME="656"></A>is not possible to belong', 'it is impossible to belong', and 'it is necessary 
<A NAME="657"></A>not to belong' are either identical or follow from one another; consequently 
<A NAME="658"></A>their opposites also, 'it is possible to belong', 'it is not impossible 
<A NAME="659"></A>to belong', and 'it is not necessary not to belong', will either be identical 
<A NAME="660"></A>or follow from one another. For of everything the affirmation or the denial 
<A NAME="661"></A>holds good. That which is possible then will be not necessary and that 
<A NAME="662"></A>which is not necessary will be possible. It results that all premisses 
<A NAME="663"></A>in the mode of possibility are convertible into one another. I mean not 
<A NAME="664"></A>that the affirmative are convertible into the negative, but that those 
<A NAME="665"></A>which are affirmative in form admit of conversion by opposition, e.g. 'it 
<A NAME="666"></A>is possible to belong' may be converted into 'it is possible not to belong', 
<A NAME="667"></A>and 'it is possible for A to belong to all B' into 'it is possible for 
<A NAME="668"></A>A to belong to no B' or 'not to all B', and 'it is possible for A to belong 
<A NAME="669"></A>to some B' into 'it is possible for A not to belong to some B'. And similarly 
<A NAME="670"></A>the other propositions in this mode can be converted. For since that which 
<A NAME="671"></A>is possible is not necessary, and that which is not necessary may possibly 
<A NAME="672"></A>not belong, it is clear that if it is possible that A should belong to 
<A NAME="673"></A>B, it is possible also that it should not belong to B: and if it is possible 
<A NAME="674"></A>that it should belong to all, it is also possible that it should not belong 
<A NAME="675"></A>to all. The same holds good in the case of particular affirmations: for 
<A NAME="676"></A>the proof is identical. And such premisses are affirmative and not negative; 
<A NAME="677"></A>for 'to be possible' is in the same rank as 'to be', as was said 
<A NAME="678"></A>above.
<A NAME="679"></A><BR><BR>Having made these distinctions we next point out that the expression 
<A NAME="680"></A>'to be possible' is used in two ways. In one it means to happen generally 
<A NAME="681"></A>and fall short of necessity, e.g. man's turning grey or growing or decaying, 
<A NAME="682"></A>or generally what naturally belongs to a thing (for this has not its necessity 
<A NAME="683"></A>unbroken, since man's existence is not continuous for ever, although if 
<A NAME="684"></A>a man does exist, it comes about either necessarily or generally). In another 
<A NAME="685"></A>sense the expression means the indefinite, which can be both thus and not 
<A NAME="686"></A>thus, e.g. an animal's walking or an earthquake's taking place while it 
<A NAME="687"></A>is walking, or generally what happens by chance: for none of these inclines 
<A NAME="688"></A>by nature in the one way more than in the opposite.
<A NAME="689"></A><BR><BR>That which is possible in each of its two senses is convertible 
<A NAME="690"></A>into its opposite, not however in the same way: but what is natural is 
<A NAME="691"></A>convertible because it does not necessarily belong (for in this sense it 
<A NAME="692"></A>is possible that a man should not grow grey) and what is indefinite is 
<A NAME="693"></A>convertible because it inclines this way no more than that. Science and 
<A NAME="694"></A>demonstrative syllogism are not concerned with things which are indefinite, 
<A NAME="695"></A>because the middle term is uncertain; but they are concerned with things 
<A NAME="696"></A>that are natural, and as a rule arguments and inquiries are made about 
<A NAME="697"></A>things which are possible in this sense. Syllogisms indeed can be made 
<A NAME="698"></A>about the former, but it is unusual at any rate to inquire about 
<A NAME="699"></A>them.
<A NAME="700"></A><BR><BR>These matters will be treated more definitely in the sequel; our 
<A NAME="701"></A>business at present is to state the moods and nature of the syllogism made 
<A NAME="702"></A>from possible premisses. The expression 'it is possible for this to belong 
<A NAME="703"></A>to that' may be understood in two senses: 'that' may mean either that to 
<A NAME="704"></A>which 'that' belongs or that to which it may belong; for the expression 
<A NAME="705"></A>'A is possible of the subject of B' means that it is possible either of 
<A NAME="706"></A>that of which B is stated or of that of which B may possibly be stated. 
<A NAME="707"></A>It makes no difference whether we say, A is possible of the subject of 
<A NAME="708"></A>B, or all B admits of A. It is clear then that the expression 'A may possibly 
<A NAME="709"></A>belong to all B' might be used in two senses. First then we must state 
<A NAME="710"></A>the nature and characteristics of the syllogism which arises if B is possible 
<A NAME="711"></A>of the subject of C, and A is possible of the subject of B. For thus both 
<A NAME="712"></A>premisses are assumed in the mode of possibility; but whenever A is possible 
<A NAME="713"></A>of that of which B is true, one premiss is a simple assertion, the other 
<A NAME="714"></A>a problematic. Consequently we must start from premisses which are similar 
<A NAME="715"></A>in form, as in the other cases.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="716"></A><B>Part 14</B>

<A NAME="717"></A><BR><BR>Whenever A may possibly belong to all B, and B to all C, there 
<A NAME="718"></A>will be a perfect syllogism to prove that A may possibly belong to all 
<A NAME="719"></A>C. This is clear from the definition: for it was in this way that we explained 
<A NAME="720"></A>'to be possible for one term to belong to all of another'. Similarly if 
<A NAME="721"></A>it is possible for A to belong no B, and for B to belong to all C, then 
<A NAME="722"></A>it is possible for A to belong to no C. For the statement that it is possible 
<A NAME="723"></A>for A not to belong to that of which B may be true means (as we saw) that 
<A NAME="724"></A>none of those things which can possibly fall under the term B is left out 
<A NAME="725"></A>of account. But whenever A may belong to all B, and B may belong to no 
<A NAME="726"></A>C, then indeed no syllogism results from the premisses assumed, but if 
<A NAME="727"></A>the premiss BC is converted after the manner of problematic propositions, 
<A NAME="728"></A>the same syllogism results as before. For since it is possible that B should 
<A NAME="729"></A>belong to no C, it is possible also that it should belong to all C. This 
<A NAME="730"></A>has been stated above. Consequently if B is possible for all C, and A is 
<A NAME="731"></A>possible for all B, the same syllogism again results. Similarly if in both 
<A NAME="732"></A>the premisses the negative is joined with 'it is possible': e.g. if A may 
<A NAME="733"></A>belong to none of the Bs, and B to none of the Cs. No syllogism results 
<A NAME="734"></A>from the assumed premisses, but if they are converted we shall have the 
<A NAME="735"></A>same syllogism as before. It is clear then that if the minor premiss is 
<A NAME="736"></A>negative, or if both premisses are negative, either no syllogism results, 
<A NAME="737"></A>or if one it is not perfect. For the necessity results from the 
<A NAME="738"></A>conversion.
<A NAME="739"></A><BR><BR>But if one of the premisses is universal, the other particular, 
<A NAME="740"></A>when the major premiss is universal there will be a perfect syllogism. 
<A NAME="741"></A>For if A is possible for all B, and B for some C, then A is possible for 
<A NAME="742"></A>some C. This is clear from the definition of being possible. Again if A 
<A NAME="743"></A>may belong to no B, and B may belong to some of the Cs, it is necessary 
<A NAME="744"></A>that A may possibly not belong to some of the Cs. The proof is the same 
<A NAME="745"></A>as above. But if the particular premiss is negative, and the universal 
<A NAME="746"></A>is affirmative, the major still being universal and the minor particular, 
<A NAME="747"></A>e.g. A is possible for all B, B may possibly not belong to some C, then 
<A NAME="748"></A>a clear syllogism does not result from the assumed premisses, but if the 
<A NAME="749"></A>particular premiss is converted and it is laid down that B possibly may 
<A NAME="750"></A>belong to some C, we shall have the same conclusion as before, as in the 
<A NAME="751"></A>cases given at the beginning.
<A NAME="752"></A><BR><BR>But if the major premiss is the minor universal, whether both are 
<A NAME="753"></A>affirmative, or negative, or different in quality, or if both are indefinite 
<A NAME="754"></A>or particular, in no way will a syllogism be possible. For nothing prevents 
<A NAME="755"></A>B from reaching beyond A, so that as predicates cover unequal areas. Let 
<A NAME="756"></A>C be that by which B extends beyond A. To C it is not possible that A should 
<A NAME="757"></A>belong-either to all or to none or to some or not to some, since premisses 
<A NAME="758"></A>in the mode of possibility are convertible and it is possible for B to 
<A NAME="759"></A>belong to more things than A can. Further, this is obvious if we take terms; 
<A NAME="760"></A>for if the premisses are as assumed, the major term is both possible for 
<A NAME="761"></A>none of the minor and must belong to all of it. Take as terms common to 
<A NAME="762"></A>all the cases under consideration 'animal'-'white'-'man', where the major 
<A NAME="763"></A>belongs necessarily to the minor; 'animal'-'white'-'garment', where it 
<A NAME="764"></A>is not possible that the major should belong to the minor. It is clear 
<A NAME="765"></A>then that if the terms are related in this manner, no syllogism results. 
<A NAME="766"></A>For every syllogism proves that something belongs either simply or necessarily 
<A NAME="767"></A>or possibly. It is clear that there is no proof of the first or of the 
<A NAME="768"></A>second. For the affirmative is destroyed by the negative, and the negative 
<A NAME="769"></A>by the affirmative. There remains the proof of possibility. But this is 
<A NAME="770"></A>impossible. For it has been proved that if the terms are related in this 
<A NAME="771"></A>manner it is both necessary that the major should belong to all the minor 
<A NAME="772"></A>and not possible that it should belong to any. Consequently there cannot 
<A NAME="773"></A>be a syllogism to prove the possibility; for the necessary (as we stated) 
<A NAME="774"></A>is not possible.
<A NAME="775"></A><BR><BR>It is clear that if the terms are universal in possible premisses 
<A NAME="776"></A>a syllogism always results in the first figure, whether they are affirmative 
<A NAME="777"></A>or negative, only a perfect syllogism results in the first case, an imperfect 
<A NAME="778"></A>in the second. But possibility must be understood according to the definition 
<A NAME="779"></A>laid down, not as covering necessity. This is sometimes 
<A NAME="780"></A>forgotten.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="781"></A><B>Part 15</B>

<A NAME="782"></A><BR><BR>If one premiss is a simple proposition, the other a problematic, 
<A NAME="783"></A>whenever the major premiss indicates possibility all the syllogisms will 
<A NAME="784"></A>be perfect and establish possibility in the sense defined; but whenever 
<A NAME="785"></A>the minor premiss indicates possibility all the syllogisms will be imperfect, 
<A NAME="786"></A>and those which are negative will establish not possibility according to 
<A NAME="787"></A>the definition, but that the major does not necessarily belong to any, 
<A NAME="788"></A>or to all, of the minor. For if this is so, we say it is possible that 
<A NAME="789"></A>it should belong to none or not to all. Let A be possible for all B, and 
<A NAME="790"></A>let B belong to all C. Since C falls under B, and A is possible for all 
<A NAME="791"></A>B, clearly it is possible for all C also. So a perfect syllogism results. 
<A NAME="792"></A>Likewise if the premiss AB is negative, and the premiss BC is affirmative, 
<A NAME="793"></A>the former stating possible, the latter simple attribution, a perfect syllogism 
<A NAME="794"></A>results proving that A possibly belongs to no C.
<A NAME="795"></A><BR><BR>It is clear that perfect syllogisms result if the minor premiss 
<A NAME="796"></A>states simple belonging: but that syllogisms will result if the modality 
<A NAME="797"></A>of the premisses is reversed, must be proved per impossibile. At the same 
<A NAME="798"></A>time it will be evident that they are imperfect: for the proof proceeds 
<A NAME="799"></A>not from the premisses assumed. First we must state that if B's being follows 
<A NAME="800"></A>necessarily from A's being, B's possibility will follow necessarily from 
<A NAME="801"></A>A's possibility. Suppose, the terms being so related, that A is possible, 
<A NAME="802"></A>and B is impossible. If then that which is possible, when it is possible 
<A NAME="803"></A>for it to be, might happen, and if that which is impossible, when it is 
<A NAME="804"></A>impossible, could not happen, and if at the same time A is possible and 
<A NAME="805"></A>B impossible, it would be possible for A to happen without B, and if to 
<A NAME="806"></A>happen, then to be. For that which has happened, when it has happened, 
<A NAME="807"></A>is. But we must take the impossible and the possible not only in the sphere 
<A NAME="808"></A>of becoming, but also in the spheres of truth and predicability, and the 
<A NAME="809"></A>various other spheres in which we speak of the possible: for it will be 
<A NAME="810"></A>alike in all. Further we must understand the statement that B's being depends 
<A NAME="811"></A>on A's being, not as meaning that if some single thing A is, B will be: 
<A NAME="812"></A>for nothing follows of necessity from the being of some one thing, but 
<A NAME="813"></A>from two at least, i.e. when the premisses are related in the manner stated 
<A NAME="814"></A>to be that of the syllogism. For if C is predicated of D, and D of F, then 
<A NAME="815"></A>C is necessarily predicated of F. And if each is possible, the conclusion 
<A NAME="816"></A>also is possible. If then, for example, one should indicate the premisses 
<A NAME="817"></A>by A, and the conclusion by B, it would not only result that if A is necessary 
<A NAME="818"></A>B is necessary, but also that if A is possible, B is 
<A NAME="819"></A>possible.
<A NAME="820"></A><BR><BR>Since this is proved it is evident that if a false and not impossible 
<A NAME="821"></A>assumption is made, the consequence of the assumption will also be false 
<A NAME="822"></A>and not impossible: e.g. if A is false, but not impossible, and if B is 
<A NAME="823"></A>the consequence of A, B also will be false but not impossible. For since 
<A NAME="824"></A>it has been proved that if B's being is the consequence of A's being, then 
<A NAME="825"></A>B's possibility will follow from A's possibility (and A is assumed to be 
<A NAME="826"></A>possible), consequently B will be possible: for if it were impossible, 
<A NAME="827"></A>the same thing would at the same time be possible and 
<A NAME="828"></A>impossible.
<A NAME="829"></A><BR><BR>Since we have defined these points, let A belong to all B, and 
<A NAME="830"></A>B be possible for all C: it is necessary then that should be a possible 
<A NAME="831"></A>attribute for all C. Suppose that it is not possible, but assume that B 
<A NAME="832"></A>belongs to all C: this is false but not impossible. If then A is not possible 
<A NAME="833"></A>for C but B belongs to all C, then A is not possible for all B: for a syllogism 
<A NAME="834"></A>is formed in the third degree. But it was assumed that A is a possible 
<A NAME="835"></A>attribute for all B. It is necessary then that A is possible for all C. 
<A NAME="836"></A>For though the assumption we made is false and not impossible, the conclusion 
<A NAME="837"></A>is impossible. It is possible also in the first figure to bring about the 
<A NAME="838"></A>impossibility, by assuming that B belongs to C. For if B belongs to all 
<A NAME="839"></A>C, and A is possible for all B, then A would be possible for all C. But 
<A NAME="840"></A>the assumption was made that A is not possible for all 
<A NAME="841"></A>C.
<A NAME="842"></A><BR><BR>We must understand 'that which belongs to all' with no limitation 
<A NAME="843"></A>in respect of time, e.g. to the present or to a particular period, but 
<A NAME="844"></A>simply without qualification. For it is by the help of such premisses that 
<A NAME="845"></A>we make syllogisms, since if the premiss is understood with reference to 
<A NAME="846"></A>the present moment, there cannot be a syllogism. For nothing perhaps prevents 
<A NAME="847"></A>'man' belonging at a particular time to everything that is moving, i.e. 
<A NAME="848"></A>if nothing else were moving: but 'moving' is possible for every horse; 
<A NAME="849"></A>yet 'man' is possible for no horse. Further let the major term be 'animal', 
<A NAME="850"></A>the middle 'moving', the the minor 'man'. The premisses then will be as 
<A NAME="851"></A>before, but the conclusion necessary, not possible. For man is necessarily 
<A NAME="852"></A>animal. It is clear then that the universal must be understood simply, 
<A NAME="853"></A>without limitation in respect of time.
<A NAME="854"></A><BR><BR>Again let the premiss AB be universal and negative, and assume 
<A NAME="855"></A>that A belongs to no B, but B possibly belongs to all C. These propositions 
<A NAME="856"></A>being laid down, it is necessary that A possibly belongs to no C. Suppose 
<A NAME="857"></A>that it cannot belong, and that B belongs to C, as above. It is necessary 
<A NAME="858"></A>then that A belongs to some B: for we have a syllogism in the third figure: 
<A NAME="859"></A>but this is impossible. Thus it will be possible for A to belong to no 
<A NAME="860"></A>C; for if at is supposed false, the consequence is an impossible one. This 
<A NAME="861"></A>syllogism then does not establish that which is possible according to the 
<A NAME="862"></A>definition, but that which does not necessarily belong to any part of the 
<A NAME="863"></A>subject (for this is the contradictory of the assumption which was made: 
<A NAME="864"></A>for it was supposed that A necessarily belongs to some C, but the syllogism 
<A NAME="865"></A>per impossibile establishes the contradictory which is opposed to this). 
<A NAME="866"></A>Further, it is clear also from an example that the conclusion will not 
<A NAME="867"></A>establish possibility. Let A be 'raven', B 'intelligent', and C 'man'. 
<A NAME="868"></A>A then belongs to no B: for no intelligent thing is a raven. But B is possible 
<A NAME="869"></A>for all C: for every man may possibly be intelligent. But A necessarily 
<A NAME="870"></A>belongs to no C: so the conclusion does not establish possibility. But 
<A NAME="871"></A>neither is it always necessary. Let A be 'moving', B 'science', C 'man'. 
<A NAME="872"></A>A then will belong to no B; but B is possible for all C. And the conclusion 
<A NAME="873"></A>will not be necessary. For it is not necessary that no man should move; 
<A NAME="874"></A>rather it is not necessary that any man should move. Clearly then the conclusion 
<A NAME="875"></A>establishes that one term does not necessarily belong to any instance of 
<A NAME="876"></A>another term. But we must take our terms better.
<A NAME="877"></A><BR><BR>If the minor premiss is negative and indicates possibility, from 
<A NAME="878"></A>the actual premisses taken there can be no syllogism, but if the problematic 
<A NAME="879"></A>premiss is converted, a syllogism will be possible, as before. Let A belong 
<A NAME="880"></A>to all B, and let B possibly belong to no C. If the terms are arranged 
<A NAME="881"></A>thus, nothing necessarily follows: but if the proposition BC is converted 
<A NAME="882"></A>and it is assumed that B is possible for all C, a syllogism results as 
<A NAME="883"></A>before: for the terms are in the same relative positions. Likewise if both 
<A NAME="884"></A>the relations are negative, if the major premiss states that A does not 
<A NAME="885"></A>belong to B, and the minor premiss indicates that B may possibly belong 
<A NAME="886"></A>to no C. Through the premisses actually taken nothing necessary results 
<A NAME="887"></A>in any way; but if the problematic premiss is converted, we shall have 
<A NAME="888"></A>a syllogism. Suppose that A belongs to no B, and B may possibly belong 
<A NAME="889"></A>to no C. Through these comes nothing necessary. But if B is assumed to 
<A NAME="890"></A>be possible for all C (and this is true) and if the premiss AB remains 
<A NAME="891"></A>as before, we shall again have the same syllogism. But if it be assumed 
<A NAME="892"></A>that B does not belong to any C, instead of possibly not belonging, there 
<A NAME="893"></A>cannot be a syllogism anyhow, whether the premiss AB is negative or affirmative. 
<A NAME="894"></A>As common instances of a necessary and positive relation we may take the 
<A NAME="895"></A>terms white-animal-snow: of a necessary and negative relation, white-animal-pitch. 
<A NAME="896"></A>Clearly then if the terms are universal, and one of the premisses is assertoric, 
<A NAME="897"></A>the other problematic, whenever the minor premiss is problematic a syllogism 
<A NAME="898"></A>always results, only sometimes it results from the premisses that are taken, 
<A NAME="899"></A>sometimes it requires the conversion of one premiss. We have stated when 
<A NAME="900"></A>each of these happens and the reason why. But if one of the relations is 
<A NAME="901"></A>universal, the other particular, then whenever the major premiss is universal 
<A NAME="902"></A>and problematic, whether affirmative or negative, and the particular is 
<A NAME="903"></A>affirmative and assertoric, there will be a perfect syllogism, just as 
<A NAME="904"></A>when the terms are universal. The demonstration is the same as before. 
<A NAME="905"></A>But whenever the major premiss is universal, but assertoric, not problematic, 
<A NAME="906"></A>and the minor is particular and problematic, whether both premisses are 
<A NAME="907"></A>negative or affirmative, or one is negative, the other affirmative, in 
<A NAME="908"></A>all cases there will be an imperfect syllogism. Only some of them will 
<A NAME="909"></A>be proved per impossibile, others by the conversion of the problematic 
<A NAME="910"></A>premiss, as has been shown above. And a syllogism will be possible by means 
<A NAME="911"></A>of conversion when the major premiss is universal and assertoric, whether 
<A NAME="912"></A>positive or negative, and the minor particular, negative, and problematic, 
<A NAME="913"></A>e.g. if A belongs to all B or to no B, and B may possibly not belong to 
<A NAME="914"></A>some C. For if the premiss BC is converted in respect of possibility, a 
<A NAME="915"></A>syllogism results. But whenever the particular premiss is assertoric and 
<A NAME="916"></A>negative, there cannot be a syllogism. As instances of the positive relation 
<A NAME="917"></A>we may take the terms white-animal-snow; of the negative, white-animal-pitch. 
<A NAME="918"></A>For the demonstration must be made through the indefinite nature of the 
<A NAME="919"></A>particular premiss. But if the minor premiss is universal, and the major 
<A NAME="920"></A>particular, whether either premiss is negative or affirmative, problematic 
<A NAME="921"></A>or assertoric, nohow is a syllogism possible. Nor is a syllogism possible 
<A NAME="922"></A>when the premisses are particular or indefinite, whether problematic or 
<A NAME="923"></A>assertoric, or the one problematic, the other assertoric. The demonstration 
<A NAME="924"></A>is the same as above. As instances of the necessary and positive relation 
<A NAME="925"></A>we may take the terms animal-white-man; of the necessary and negative relation, 
<A NAME="926"></A>animal-white-garment. It is evident then that if the major premiss is universal, 
<A NAME="927"></A>a syllogism always results, but if the minor is universal nothing at all 
<A NAME="928"></A>can ever be proved.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="929"></A><B>Part 16</B>

<A NAME="930"></A><BR><BR>Whenever one premiss is necessary, the other problematic, there 
<A NAME="931"></A>will be a syllogism when the terms are related as before; and a perfect 
<A NAME="932"></A>syllogism when the minor premiss is necessary. If the premisses are affirmative 
<A NAME="933"></A>the conclusion will be problematic, not assertoric, whether the premisses 
<A NAME="934"></A>are universal or not: but if one is affirmative, the other negative, when 
<A NAME="935"></A>the affirmative is necessary the conclusion will be problematic, not negative 
<A NAME="936"></A>assertoric; but when the negative is necessary the conclusion will be problematic 
<A NAME="937"></A>negative, and assertoric negative, whether the premisses are universal 
<A NAME="938"></A>or not. Possibility in the conclusion must be understood in the same manner 
<A NAME="939"></A>as before. There cannot be an inference to the necessary negative proposition: 
<A NAME="940"></A>for 'not necessarily to belong' is different from 'necessarily not to 
<A NAME="941"></A>belong'.
<A NAME="942"></A><BR><BR>If the premisses are affirmative, clearly the conclusion which 
<A NAME="943"></A>follows is not necessary. Suppose A necessarily belongs to all B, and let 
<A NAME="944"></A>B be possible for all C. We shall have an imperfect syllogism to prove 
<A NAME="945"></A>that A may belong to all C. That it is imperfect is clear from the proof: 
<A NAME="946"></A>for it will be proved in the same manner as above. Again, let A be possible 
<A NAME="947"></A>for all B, and let B necessarily belong to all C. We shall then have a 
<A NAME="948"></A>syllogism to prove that A may belong to all C, not that A does belong to 
<A NAME="949"></A>all C: and it is perfect, not imperfect: for it is completed directly through 
<A NAME="950"></A>the original premisses.
<A NAME="951"></A><BR><BR>But if the premisses are not similar in quality, suppose first 
<A NAME="952"></A>that the negative premiss is necessary, and let necessarily A not be possible 
<A NAME="953"></A>for any B, but let B be possible for all C. It is necessary then that A 
<A NAME="954"></A>belongs to no C. For suppose A to belong to all C or to some C. Now we 
<A NAME="955"></A>assumed that A is not possible for any B. Since then the negative proposition 
<A NAME="956"></A>is convertible, B is not possible for any A. But A is supposed to belong 
<A NAME="957"></A>to all C or to some C. Consequently B will not be possible for any C or 
<A NAME="958"></A>for all C. But it was originally laid down that B is possible for all C. 
<A NAME="959"></A>And it is clear that the possibility of belonging can be inferred, since 
<A NAME="960"></A>the fact of not belonging is inferred. Again, let the affirmative premiss 
<A NAME="961"></A>be necessary, and let A possibly not belong to any B, and let B necessarily 
<A NAME="962"></A>belong to all C. The syllogism will be perfect, but it will establish a 
<A NAME="963"></A>problematic negative, not an assertoric negative. For the major premiss 
<A NAME="964"></A>was problematic, and further it is not possible to prove the assertoric 
<A NAME="965"></A>conclusion per impossibile. For if it were supposed that A belongs to some 
<A NAME="966"></A>C, and it is laid down that A possibly does not belong to any B, no impossible 
<A NAME="967"></A>relation between B and C follows from these premisses. But if the minor 
<A NAME="968"></A>premiss is negative, when it is problematic a syllogism is possible by 
<A NAME="969"></A>conversion, as above; but when it is necessary no syllogism can be formed. 
<A NAME="970"></A>Nor again when both premisses are negative, and the minor is necessary. 
<A NAME="971"></A>The same terms as before serve both for the positive relation-white-animal-snow, 
<A NAME="972"></A>and for the negative relation-white-animal-pitch.
<A NAME="973"></A><BR><BR>The same relation will obtain in particular syllogisms. Whenever 
<A NAME="974"></A>the negative proposition is necessary, the conclusion will be negative 
<A NAME="975"></A>assertoric: e.g. if it is not possible that A should belong to any B, but 
<A NAME="976"></A>B may belong to some of the Cs, it is necessary that A should not belong 
<A NAME="977"></A>to some of the Cs. For if A belongs to all C, but cannot belong to any 
<A NAME="978"></A>B, neither can B belong to any A. So if A belongs to all C, to none of 
<A NAME="979"></A>the Cs can B belong. But it was laid down that B may belong to some C. 
<A NAME="980"></A>But when the particular affirmative in the negative syllogism, e.g. BC 
<A NAME="981"></A>the minor premiss, or the universal proposition in the affirmative syllogism, 
<A NAME="982"></A>e.g. AB the major premiss, is necessary, there will not be an assertoric 
<A NAME="983"></A>conclusion. The demonstration is the same as before. But if the minor premiss 
<A NAME="984"></A>is universal, and problematic, whether affirmative or negative, and the 
<A NAME="985"></A>major premiss is particular and necessary, there cannot be a syllogism. 
<A NAME="986"></A>Premisses of this kind are possible both where the relation is positive 
<A NAME="987"></A>and necessary, e.g. animal-white-man, and where it is necessary and negative, 
<A NAME="988"></A>e.g. animal-white-garment. But when the universal is necessary, the particular 
<A NAME="989"></A>problematic, if the universal is negative we may take the terms animal-white-raven 
<A NAME="990"></A>to illustrate the positive relation, or animal-white-pitch to illustrate 
<A NAME="991"></A>the negative; and if the universal is affirmative we may take the terms 
<A NAME="992"></A>animal-white-swan to illustrate the positive relation, and animal-white-snow 
<A NAME="993"></A>to illustrate the negative and necessary relation. Nor again is a syllogism 
<A NAME="994"></A>possible when the premisses are indefinite, or both particular. Terms applicable 
<A NAME="995"></A>in either case to illustrate the positive relation are animal-white-man: 
<A NAME="996"></A>to illustrate the negative, animal-white-inanimate. For the relation of 
<A NAME="997"></A>animal to some white, and of white to some inanimate, is both necessary 
<A NAME="998"></A>and positive and necessary and negative. Similarly if the relation is problematic: 
<A NAME="999"></A>so the terms may be used for all cases.
<A NAME="1000"></A><BR><BR>Clearly then from what has been said a syllogism results or not 
<A NAME="1001"></A>from similar relations of the terms whether we are dealing with simple 
<A NAME="1002"></A>existence or necessity, with this exception, that if the negative premiss 
<A NAME="1003"></A>is assertoric the conclusion is problematic, but if the negative premiss 
<A NAME="1004"></A>is necessary the conclusion is both problematic and negative assertoric. 
<A NAME="1005"></A>[It is clear also that all the syllogisms are imperfect and are perfected 
<A NAME="1006"></A>by means of the figures above mentioned.]
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="1007"></A><B>Part 17</B>

<A NAME="1008"></A><BR><BR>In the second figure whenever both premisses are problematic, no 
<A NAME="1009"></A>syllogism is possible, whether the premisses are affirmative or negative, 
<A NAME="1010"></A>universal or particular. But when one premiss is assertoric, the other 
<A NAME="1011"></A>problematic, if the affirmative is assertoric no syllogism is possible, 
<A NAME="1012"></A>but if the universal negative is assertoric a conclusion can always be 
<A NAME="1013"></A>drawn. Similarly when one premiss is necessary, the other problematic. 
<A NAME="1014"></A>Here also we must understand the term 'possible' in the conclusion, in 
<A NAME="1015"></A>the same sense as before.
<A NAME="1016"></A><BR><BR>First we must point out that the negative problematic proposition 
<A NAME="1017"></A>is not convertible, e.g. if A may belong to no B, it does not follow that 
<A NAME="1018"></A>B may belong to no A. For suppose it to follow and assume that B may belong 
<A NAME="1019"></A>to no A. Since then problematic affirmations are convertible with negations, 
<A NAME="1020"></A>whether they are contraries or contradictories, and since B may belong 
<A NAME="1021"></A>to no A, it is clear that B may belong to all A. But this is false: for 
<A NAME="1022"></A>if all this can be that, it does not follow that all that can be this: 
<A NAME="1023"></A>consequently the negative proposition is not convertible. Further, these 
<A NAME="1024"></A>propositions are not incompatible, 'A may belong to no B', 'B necessarily 
<A NAME="1025"></A>does not belong to some of the As'; e.g. it is possible that no man should 
<A NAME="1026"></A>be white (for it is also possible that every man should be white), but 
<A NAME="1027"></A>it is not true to say that it is possible that no white thing should be 
<A NAME="1028"></A>a man: for many white things are necessarily not men, and the necessary 
<A NAME="1029"></A>(as we saw) other than the possible.
<A NAME="1030"></A><BR><BR>Moreover it is not possible to prove the convertibility of these 
<A NAME="1031"></A>propositions by a reductio ad absurdum, i.e. by claiming assent to the 
<A NAME="1032"></A>following argument: 'since it is false that B may belong to no A, it is 
<A NAME="1033"></A>true that it cannot belong to no A, for the one statement is the contradictory 
<A NAME="1034"></A>of the other. But if this is so, it is true that B necessarily belongs 
<A NAME="1035"></A>to some of the As: consequently A necessarily belongs to some of the Bs. 
<A NAME="1036"></A>But this is impossible.' The argument cannot be admitted, for it does not 
<A NAME="1037"></A>follow that some A is necessarily B, if it is not possible that no A should 
<A NAME="1038"></A>be B. For the latter expression is used in two senses, one if A some is 
<A NAME="1039"></A>necessarily B, another if some A is necessarily not B. For it is not true 
<A NAME="1040"></A>to say that that which necessarily does not belong to some of the As may 
<A NAME="1041"></A>possibly not belong to any A, just as it is not true to say that what necessarily 
<A NAME="1042"></A>belongs to some A may possibly belong to all A. If any one then should 
<A NAME="1043"></A>claim that because it is not possible for C to belong to all D, it necessarily 
<A NAME="1044"></A>does not belong to some D, he would make a false assumption: for it does 
<A NAME="1045"></A>belong to all D, but because in some cases it belongs necessarily, therefore 
<A NAME="1046"></A>we say that it is not possible for it to belong to all. Hence both the 
<A NAME="1047"></A>propositions 'A necessarily belongs to some B' and 'A necessarily does 
<A NAME="1048"></A>not belong to some B' are opposed to the proposition 'A belongs to all 
<A NAME="1049"></A>B'. Similarly also they are opposed to the proposition 'A may belong to 
<A NAME="1050"></A>no B'. It is clear then that in relation to what is possible and not possible, 
<A NAME="1051"></A>in the sense originally defined, we must assume, not that A necessarily 
<A NAME="1052"></A>belongs to some B, but that A necessarily does not belong to some B. But 
<A NAME="1053"></A>if this is assumed, no absurdity results: consequently no syllogism. It 
<A NAME="1054"></A>is clear from what has been said that the negative proposition is not 
<A NAME="1055"></A>convertible.
<A NAME="1056"></A><BR><BR>This being proved, suppose it possible that A may belong to no 
<A NAME="1057"></A>B and to all C. By means of conversion no syllogism will result: for the 
<A NAME="1058"></A>major premiss, as has been said, is not convertible. Nor can a proof be 
<A NAME="1059"></A>obtained by a reductio ad absurdum: for if it is assumed that B can belong 
<A NAME="1060"></A>to all C, no false consequence results: for A may belong both to all C 
<A NAME="1061"></A>and to no C. In general, if there is a syllogism, it is clear that its 
<A NAME="1062"></A>conclusion will be problematic because neither of the premisses is assertoric; 
<A NAME="1063"></A>and this must be either affirmative or negative. But neither is possible. 
<A NAME="1064"></A>Suppose the conclusion is affirmative: it will be proved by an example 
<A NAME="1065"></A>that the predicate cannot belong to the subject. Suppose the conclusion 
<A NAME="1066"></A>is negative: it will be proved that it is not problematic but necessary. 
<A NAME="1067"></A>Let A be white, B man, C horse. It is possible then for A to belong to 
<A NAME="1068"></A>all of the one and to none of the other. But it is not possible for B to 
<A NAME="1069"></A>belong nor not to belong to C. That it is not possible for it to belong, 
<A NAME="1070"></A>is clear. For no horse is a man. Neither is it possible for it not to belong. 
<A NAME="1071"></A>For it is necessary that no horse should be a man, but the necessary we 
<A NAME="1072"></A>found to be different from the possible. No syllogism then results. A similar 
<A NAME="1073"></A>proof can be given if the major premiss is negative, the minor affirmative, 
<A NAME="1074"></A>or if both are affirmative or negative. The demonstration can be made by 
<A NAME="1075"></A>means of the same terms. And whenever one premiss is universal, the other 
<A NAME="1076"></A>particular, or both are particular or indefinite, or in whatever other 
<A NAME="1077"></A>way the premisses can be altered, the proof will always proceed through 
<A NAME="1078"></A>the same terms. Clearly then, if both the premisses are problematic, no 
<A NAME="1079"></A>syllogism results.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="1080"></A><B>Part 18</B>

<A NAME="1081"></A><BR><BR>But if one premiss is assertoric, the other problematic, if the 
<A NAME="1082"></A>affirmative is assertoric and the negative problematic no syllogism will 
<A NAME="1083"></A>be possible, whether the premisses are universal or particular. The proof 
<A NAME="1084"></A>is the same as above, and by means of the same terms. But when the affirmative 
<A NAME="1085"></A>premiss is problematic, and the negative assertoric, we shall have a syllogism. 
<A NAME="1086"></A>Suppose A belongs to no B, but can belong to all C. If the negative proposition 
<A NAME="1087"></A>is converted, B will belong to no A. But ex hypothesi can belong to all 
<A NAME="1088"></A>C: so a syllogism is made, proving by means of the first figure that B 
<A NAME="1089"></A>may belong to no C. Similarly also if the minor premiss is negative. But 
<A NAME="1090"></A>if both premisses are negative, one being assertoric, the other problematic,

<A NAME="1093"></A>a syllogism is formed to prove that B may belong to no C, as before: for 
<A NAME="1094"></A>we shall again have the first figure. But if both premisses are affirmative, 
<A NAME="1095"></A>no syllogism will be possible. This arrangement of terms is possible both
