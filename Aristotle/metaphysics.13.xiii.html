<A NAME="10"></A><B>Part 1</B>
<A NAME="11"></A><BR><BR>"<BR><BR>
<A NAME="12"></A><BR><BR>"WE have stated what is the substance of sensible things, dealing 
<A NAME="13"></A>in the treatise on physics with matter, and later with the substance which 
<A NAME="14"></A>has actual existence. Now since our inquiry is whether there is or is not 
<A NAME="15"></A>besides the sensible substances any which is immovable and eternal, and, 
<A NAME="16"></A>if there is, what it is, we must first consider what is said by others, 
<A NAME="17"></A>so that, if there is anything which they say wrongly, we may not be liable 
<A NAME="18"></A>to the same objections, while, if there is any opinion common to them and 
<A NAME="19"></A>us, we shall have no private grievance against ourselves on that account; 
<A NAME="20"></A>for one must be content to state some points better than one's predecessors, 
<A NAME="21"></A>and others no worse. <BR><BR>"Two opinions are held on this subject; it 
<A NAME="22"></A>is said that the objects of mathematics-i.e. numbers and lines and the 
<A NAME="23"></A>like-are substances, and again that the Ideas are substances. And (1) since 
<A NAME="24"></A>some recognize these as two different classes-the Ideas and the mathematical 
<A NAME="25"></A>numbers, and (2) some recognize both as having one nature, while (3) some 
<A NAME="26"></A>others say that the mathematical substances are the only substances, we 
<A NAME="27"></A>must consider first the objects of mathematics, not qualifying them by 
<A NAME="28"></A>any other characteristic-not asking, for instance, whether they are in 
<A NAME="29"></A>fact Ideas or not, or whether they are the principles and substances of 
<A NAME="30"></A>existing things or not, but only whether as objects of mathematics they 
<A NAME="31"></A>exist or not, and if they exist, how they exist. Then after this we must 
<A NAME="32"></A>separately consider the Ideas themselves in a general way, and only as 
<A NAME="33"></A>far as the accepted mode of treatment demands; for most of the points have 
<A NAME="34"></A>been repeatedly made even by the discussions outside our school, and, further, 
<A NAME="35"></A>the greater part of our account must finish by throwing light on that inquiry, 
<A NAME="36"></A>viz. when we examine whether the substances and the principles of existing 
<A NAME="37"></A>things are numbers and Ideas; for after the discussion of the Ideas this 
<A NAME="38"></A>remans as a third inquiry. <BR><BR>"If the objects of mathematics exist, 
<A NAME="39"></A>they must exist either in sensible objects, as some say, or separate from 
<A NAME="40"></A>sensible objects (and this also is said by some); or if they exist in neither 
<A NAME="41"></A>of these ways, either they do not exist, or they exist only in some special 
<A NAME="42"></A>sense. So that the subject of our discussion will be not whether they exist 
<A NAME="43"></A>but how they exist.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="44"></A><B>Part 2</B>
<A NAME="45"></A>"<BR><BR>
<A NAME="46"></A><BR><BR>"That it is impossible for mathematical objects to exist in sensible 
<A NAME="47"></A>things, and at the same time that the doctrine in question is an artificial 
<A NAME="48"></A>one, has been said already in our discussion of difficulties we have pointed 
<A NAME="49"></A>out that it is impossible for two solids to be in the same place, and also 
<A NAME="50"></A>that according to the same argument the other powers and characteristics 
<A NAME="51"></A>also should exist in sensible things and none of them separately. This 
<A NAME="52"></A>we have said already. But, further, it is obvious that on this theory it 
<A NAME="53"></A>is impossible for any body whatever to be divided; for it would have to 
<A NAME="54"></A>be divided at a plane, and the plane at a line, and the line at a point, 
<A NAME="55"></A>so that if the point cannot be divided, neither can the line, and if the 
<A NAME="56"></A>line cannot, neither can the plane nor the solid. What difference, then, 
<A NAME="57"></A>does it make whether sensible things are such indivisible entities, or, 
<A NAME="58"></A>without being so themselves, have indivisible entities in them? The result 
<A NAME="59"></A>will be the same; if the sensible entities are divided the others will 
<A NAME="60"></A>be divided too, or else not even the sensible entities can be divided. 
<A NAME="61"></A><BR><BR>"But, again, it is not possible that such entities should exist 
<A NAME="62"></A>separately. For if besides the sensible solids there are to be other solids 
<A NAME="63"></A>which are separate from them and prior to the sensible solids, it is plain 
<A NAME="64"></A>that besides the planes also there must be other and separate planes and 
<A NAME="65"></A>points and lines; for consistency requires this. But if these exist, again 
<A NAME="66"></A>besides the planes and lines and points of the mathematical solid there 
<A NAME="67"></A>must be others which are separate. (For incomposites are prior to compounds; 
<A NAME="68"></A>and if there are, prior to the sensible bodies, bodies which are not sensible, 
<A NAME="69"></A>by the same argument the planes which exist by themselves must be prior 
<A NAME="70"></A>to those which are in the motionless solids. Therefore these will be planes 
<A NAME="71"></A>and lines other than those that exist along with the mathematical solids 
<A NAME="72"></A>to which these thinkers assign separate existence; for the latter exist 
<A NAME="73"></A>along with the mathematical solids, while the others are prior to the mathematical 
<A NAME="74"></A>solids.) Again, therefore, there will be, belonging to these planes, lines, 
<A NAME="75"></A>and prior to them there will have to be, by the same argument, other lines 
<A NAME="76"></A>and points; and prior to these points in the prior lines there will have 
<A NAME="77"></A>to be other points, though there will be no others prior to these. Now 
<A NAME="78"></A>(1) the accumulation becomes absurd; for we find ourselves with one set 
<A NAME="79"></A>of solids apart from the sensible solids; three sets of planes apart from 
<A NAME="80"></A>the sensible planes-those which exist apart from the sensible planes, and 
<A NAME="81"></A>those in the mathematical solids, and those which exist apart from those 
<A NAME="82"></A>in the mathematical solids; four sets of lines, and five sets of points. 
<A NAME="83"></A>With which of these, then, will the mathematical sciences deal? Certainly 
<A NAME="84"></A>not with the planes and lines and points in the motionless solid; for science 
<A NAME="85"></A>always deals with what is prior. And (the same account will apply also 
<A NAME="86"></A>to numbers; for there will be a different set of units apart from each 
<A NAME="87"></A>set of points, and also apart from each set of realities, from the objects 
<A NAME="88"></A>of sense and again from those of thought; so that there will be various 
<A NAME="89"></A>classes of mathematical numbers. <BR><BR>"Again, how is it possible to 
<A NAME="90"></A>solve the questions which we have already enumerated in our discussion 
<A NAME="91"></A>of difficulties? For the objects of astronomy will exist apart from sensible 
<A NAME="92"></A>things just as the objects of geometry will; but how is it possible that 
<A NAME="93"></A>a heaven and its parts-or anything else which has movement-should exist 
<A NAME="94"></A>apart? Similarly also the objects of optics and of harmonics will exist 
<A NAME="95"></A>apart; for there will be both voice and sight besides the sensible or individual 
<A NAME="96"></A>voices and sights. Therefore it is plain that the other senses as well, 
<A NAME="97"></A>and the other objects of sense, will exist apart; for why should one set 
<A NAME="98"></A>of them do so and another not? And if this is so, there will also be animals 
<A NAME="99"></A>existing apart, since there will be senses. <BR><BR>"Again, there are certain 
<A NAME="100"></A>mathematical theorems that are universal, extending beyond these substances. 
<A NAME="101"></A>Here then we shall have another intermediate substance separate both from 
<A NAME="102"></A>the Ideas and from the intermediates,-a substance which is neither number 
<A NAME="103"></A>nor points nor spatial magnitude nor time. And if this is impossible, plainly 
<A NAME="104"></A>it is also impossible that the former entities should exist separate from 
<A NAME="105"></A>sensible things. <BR><BR>"And, in general, conclusion contrary alike to 
<A NAME="106"></A>the truth and to the usual views follow, if one is to suppose the objects 
<A NAME="107"></A>of mathematics to exist thus as separate entities. For because they exist 
<A NAME="108"></A>thus they must be prior to sensible spatial magnitudes, but in truth they 
<A NAME="109"></A>must be posterior; for the incomplete spatial magnitude is in the order 
<A NAME="110"></A>of generation prior, but in the order of substance posterior, as the lifeless 
<A NAME="111"></A>is to the living. <BR><BR>"Again, by virtue of what, and when, will mathematical 
<A NAME="112"></A>magnitudes be one? For things in our perceptible world are one in virtue 
<A NAME="113"></A>of soul, or of a part of soul, or of something else that is reasonable 
<A NAME="114"></A>enough; when these are not present, the thing is a plurality, and splits 
<A NAME="115"></A>up into parts. But in the case of the subjects of mathematics, which are 
<A NAME="116"></A>divisible and are quantities, what is the cause of their being one and 
<A NAME="117"></A>holding together? <BR><BR>"Again, the modes of generation of the objects 
<A NAME="118"></A>of mathematics show that we are right. For the dimension first generated 
<A NAME="119"></A>is length, then comes breadth, lastly depth, and the process is complete. 
<A NAME="120"></A>If, then, that which is posterior in the order of generation is prior in 
<A NAME="121"></A>the order of substantiality, the solid will be prior to the plane and the 
<A NAME="122"></A>line. And in this way also it is both more complete and more whole, because 
<A NAME="123"></A>it can become animate. How, on the other hand, could a line or a plane 
<A NAME="124"></A>be animate? The supposition passes the power of our senses. <BR><BR>"Again, 
<A NAME="125"></A>the solid is a sort of substance; for it already has in a sense completeness. 
<A NAME="126"></A>But how can lines be substances? Neither as a form or shape, as the soul 
<A NAME="127"></A>perhaps is, nor as matter, like the solid; for we have no experience of 
<A NAME="128"></A>anything that can be put together out of lines or planes or points, while 
<A NAME="129"></A>if these had been a sort of material substance, we should have observed 
<A NAME="130"></A>things which could be put together out of them. <BR><BR>"Grant, then, that 
<A NAME="131"></A>they are prior in definition. Still not all things that are prior in definition 
<A NAME="132"></A>are also prior in substantiality. For those things are prior in substantiality 
<A NAME="133"></A>which when separated from other things surpass them in the power of independent 
<A NAME="134"></A>existence, but things are prior in definition to those whose definitions 
<A NAME="135"></A>are compounded out of their definitions; and these two properties are not 
<A NAME="136"></A>coextensive. For if attributes do not exist apart from the substances (e.g. 
<A NAME="137"></A>a 'mobile' or a pale'), pale is prior to the pale man in definition, but 
<A NAME="138"></A>not in substantiality. For it cannot exist separately, but is always along 
<A NAME="139"></A>with the concrete thing; and by the concrete thing I mean the pale man. 
<A NAME="140"></A>Therefore it is plain that neither is the result of abstraction prior nor 
<A NAME="141"></A>that which is produced by adding determinants posterior; for it is by adding 
<A NAME="142"></A>a determinant to pale that we speak of the pale man. <BR><BR>"It has, then, 
<A NAME="143"></A>been sufficiently pointed out that the objects of mathematics are not substances 
<A NAME="144"></A>in a higher degree than bodies are, and that they are not prior to sensibles 
<A NAME="145"></A>in being, but only in definition, and that they cannot exist somewhere 
<A NAME="146"></A>apart. But since it was not possible for them to exist in sensibles either, 
<A NAME="147"></A>it is plain that they either do not exist at all or exist in a special 
<A NAME="148"></A>sense and therefore do not 'exist' without qualification. For 'exist' has 
<A NAME="149"></A>many senses.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="150"></A><B>Part 3</B>
<A NAME="151"></A>"<BR><BR>
<A NAME="152"></A><BR><BR>"For just as the universal propositions of mathematics deal not 
<A NAME="153"></A>with objects which exist separately, apart from extended magnitudes and 
<A NAME="154"></A>from numbers, but with magnitudes and numbers, not however qua such as 
<A NAME="155"></A>to have magnitude or to be divisible, clearly it is possible that there 
<A NAME="156"></A>should also be both propositions and demonstrations about sensible magnitudes, 
<A NAME="157"></A>not however qua sensible but qua possessed of certain definite qualities. 
<A NAME="158"></A>For as there are many propositions about things merely considered as in 
<A NAME="159"></A>motion, apart from what each such thing is and from their accidents, and 
<A NAME="160"></A>as it is not therefore necessary that there should be either a mobile separate 
<A NAME="161"></A>from sensibles, or a distinct mobile entity in the sensibles, so too in 
<A NAME="162"></A>the case of mobiles there will be propositions and sciences, which treat 
<A NAME="163"></A>them however not qua mobile but only qua bodies, or again only qua planes, 
<A NAME="164"></A>or only qua lines, or qua divisibles, or qua indivisibles having position, 
<A NAME="165"></A>or only qua indivisibles. Thus since it is true to say without qualification 
<A NAME="166"></A>that not only things which are separable but also things which are inseparable 
<A NAME="167"></A>exist (for instance, that mobiles exist), it is true also to say without 
<A NAME="168"></A>qualification that the objects of mathematics exist, and with the character 
<A NAME="169"></A>ascribed to them by mathematicians. And as it is true to say of the other 
<A NAME="170"></A>sciences too, without qualification, that they deal with such and such 
<A NAME="171"></A>a subject-not with what is accidental to it (e.g. not with the pale, if 
<A NAME="172"></A>the healthy thing is pale, and the science has the healthy as its subject), 
<A NAME="173"></A>but with that which is the subject of each science-with the healthy if 
<A NAME="174"></A>it treats its object qua healthy, with man if qua man:-so too is it with 
<A NAME="175"></A>geometry; if its subjects happen to be sensible, though it does not treat 
<A NAME="176"></A>them qua sensible, the mathematical sciences will not for that reason be 
<A NAME="177"></A>sciences of sensibles-nor, on the other hand, of other things separate 
<A NAME="178"></A>from sensibles. Many properties attach to things in virtue of their own 
<A NAME="179"></A>nature as possessed of each such character; e.g. there are attributes peculiar 
<A NAME="180"></A>to the animal qua female or qua male (yet there is no 'female' nor 'male' 
<A NAME="181"></A>separate from animals); so that there are also attributes which belong 
<A NAME="182"></A>to things merely as lengths or as planes. And in proportion as we are dealing 
<A NAME="183"></A>with things which are prior in definition and simpler, our knowledge has 
<A NAME="184"></A>more accuracy, i.e. simplicity. Therefore a science which abstracts from 
<A NAME="185"></A>spatial magnitude is more precise than one which takes it into account; 
<A NAME="186"></A>and a science is most precise if it abstracts from movement, but if it 
<A NAME="187"></A>takes account of movement, it is most precise if it deals with the primary 
<A NAME="188"></A>movement, for this is the simplest; and of this again uniform movement 
<A NAME="189"></A>is the simplest form. <BR><BR>"The same account may be given of harmonics 
<A NAME="190"></A>and optics; for neither considers its objects qua sight or qua voice, but 
<A NAME="191"></A>qua lines and numbers; but the latter are attributes proper to the former. 
<A NAME="192"></A>And mechanics too proceeds in the same way. Therefore if we suppose attributes 
<A NAME="193"></A>separated from their fellow attributes and make any inquiry concerning 
<A NAME="194"></A>them as such, we shall not for this reason be in error, any more than when 
<A NAME="195"></A>one draws a line on the ground and calls it a foot long when it is not; 
<A NAME="196"></A>for the error is not included in the premisses. <BR><BR>"Each question 
<A NAME="197"></A>will be best investigated in this way-by setting up by an act of separation 
<A NAME="198"></A>what is not separate, as the arithmetician and the geometer do. For a man 
<A NAME="199"></A>qua man is one indivisible thing; and the arithmetician supposed one indivisible 
<A NAME="200"></A>thing, and then considered whether any attribute belongs to a man qua indivisible. 
<A NAME="201"></A>But the geometer treats him neither qua man nor qua indivisible, but as 
<A NAME="202"></A>a solid. For evidently the properties which would have belonged to him 
<A NAME="203"></A>even if perchance he had not been indivisible, can belong to him even apart 
<A NAME="204"></A>from these attributes. Thus, then, geometers speak correctly; they talk 
<A NAME="205"></A>about existing things, and their subjects do exist; for being has two forms-it 
<A NAME="206"></A>exists not only in complete reality but also materially. <BR><BR>"Now since 
<A NAME="207"></A>the good and the beautiful are different (for the former always implies 
<A NAME="208"></A>conduct as its subject, while the beautiful is found also in motionless 
<A NAME="209"></A>things), those who assert that the mathematical sciences say nothing of 
<A NAME="210"></A>the beautiful or the good are in error. For these sciences say and prove 
<A NAME="211"></A>a great deal about them; if they do not expressly mention them, but prove 
<A NAME="212"></A>attributes which are their results or their definitions, it is not true 
<A NAME="213"></A>to say that they tell us nothing about them. The chief forms of beauty 
<A NAME="214"></A>are order and symmetry and definiteness, which the mathematical sciences 
<A NAME="215"></A>demonstrate in a special degree. And since these (e.g. order and definiteness) 
<A NAME="216"></A>are obviously causes of many things, evidently these sciences must treat 
<A NAME="217"></A>this sort of causative principle also (i.e. the beautiful) as in some sense 
<A NAME="218"></A>a cause. But we shall speak more plainly elsewhere about these 
<A NAME="219"></A>matters.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="220"></A><B>Part 4</B>
<A NAME="221"></A>"<BR><BR>
<A NAME="222"></A><BR><BR>"So much then for the objects of mathematics; we have said that 
<A NAME="223"></A>they exist and in what sense they exist, and in what sense they are prior 
<A NAME="224"></A>and in what sense not prior. Now, regarding the Ideas, we must first examine 
<A NAME="225"></A>the ideal theory itself, not connecting it in any way with the nature of 
<A NAME="226"></A>numbers, but treating it in the form in which it was originally understood 
<A NAME="227"></A>by those who first maintained the existence of the Ideas. The supporters 
<A NAME="228"></A>of the ideal theory were led to it because on the question about the truth 
<A NAME="229"></A>of things they accepted the Heraclitean sayings which describe all sensible 
<A NAME="230"></A>things as ever passing away, so that if knowledge or thought is to have 
<A NAME="231"></A>an object, there must be some other and permanent entities, apart from 
<A NAME="232"></A>those which are sensible; for there could be no knowledge of things which 
<A NAME="233"></A>were in a state of flux. But when Socrates was occupying himself with the 
<A NAME="234"></A>excellences of character, and in connexion with them became the first to 
<A NAME="235"></A>raise the problem of universal definition (for of the physicists Democritus 
<A NAME="236"></A>only touched on the subject to a small extent, and defined, after a fashion, 
<A NAME="237"></A>the hot and the cold; while the Pythagoreans had before this treated of 
<A NAME="238"></A>a few things, whose definitions-e.g. those of opportunity, justice, or 
<A NAME="239"></A>marriage-they connected with numbers; but it was natural that Socrates 
<A NAME="240"></A>should be seeking the essence, for he was seeking to syllogize, and 'what 
<A NAME="241"></A>a thing is' is the starting-point of syllogisms; for there was as yet none 
<A NAME="242"></A>of the dialectical power which enables people even without knowledge of 
<A NAME="243"></A>the essence to speculate about contraries and inquire whether the same 
<A NAME="244"></A>science deals with contraries; for two things may be fairly ascribed to 
<A NAME="245"></A>Socrates-inductive arguments and universal definition, both of which are 
<A NAME="246"></A>concerned with the starting-point of science):-but Socrates did not make 
<A NAME="247"></A>the universals or the definitions exist apart: they, however, gave them 
<A NAME="248"></A>separate existence, and this was the kind of thing they called Ideas. Therefore 
<A NAME="249"></A>it followed for them, almost by the same argument, that there must be Ideas 
<A NAME="250"></A>of all things that are spoken of universally, and it was almost as if a 
<A NAME="251"></A>man wished to count certain things, and while they were few thought he 
<A NAME="252"></A>would not be able to count them, but made more of them and then counted 
<A NAME="253"></A>them; for the Forms are, one may say, more numerous than the particular 
<A NAME="254"></A>sensible things, yet it was in seeking the causes of these that they proceeded 
<A NAME="255"></A>from them to the Forms. For to each thing there answers an entity which 
<A NAME="256"></A>has the same name and exists apart from the substances, and so also in 
<A NAME="257"></A>the case of all other groups there is a one over many, whether these be 
<A NAME="258"></A>of this world or eternal. <BR><BR>"Again, of the ways in which it is proved 
<A NAME="259"></A>that the Forms exist, none is convincing; for from some no inference necessarily 
<A NAME="260"></A>follows, and from some arise Forms even of things of which they think there 
<A NAME="261"></A>are no Forms. For according to the arguments from the sciences there will 
<A NAME="262"></A>be Forms of all things of which there are sciences, and according to the 
<A NAME="263"></A>argument of the 'one over many' there will be Forms even of negations, 
<A NAME="264"></A>and according to the argument that thought has an object when the individual 
<A NAME="265"></A>object has perished, there will be Forms of perishable things; for we have 
<A NAME="266"></A>an image of these. Again, of the most accurate arguments, some lead to 
<A NAME="267"></A>Ideas of relations, of which they say there is no independent class, and 
<A NAME="268"></A>others introduce the 'third man'. <BR><BR>"And in general the arguments 
<A NAME="269"></A>for the Forms destroy things for whose existence the believers in Forms 
<A NAME="270"></A>are more zealous than for the existence of the Ideas; for it follows that 
<A NAME="271"></A>not the dyad but number is first, and that prior to number is the relative, 
<A NAME="272"></A>and that this is prior to the absolute-besides all the other points on 
<A NAME="273"></A>which certain people, by following out the opinions held about the Forms, 
<A NAME="274"></A>came into conflict with the principles of the theory. <BR><BR>"Again, according 
<A NAME="275"></A>to the assumption on the belief in the Ideas rests, there will be Forms 
<A NAME="276"></A>not only of substances but also of many other things; for the concept is 
<A NAME="277"></A>single not only in the case of substances, but also in that of non-substances, 
<A NAME="278"></A>and there are sciences of other things than substance; and a thousand other 
<A NAME="279"></A>such difficulties confront them. But according to the necessities of the 
<A NAME="280"></A>case and the opinions about the Forms, if they can be shared in there must 
<A NAME="281"></A>be Ideas of substances only. For they are not shared in incidentally, but 
<A NAME="282"></A>each Form must be shared in as something not predicated of a subject. (By 
<A NAME="283"></A>'being shared in incidentally' I mean that if a thing shares in 'double 
<A NAME="284"></A>itself', it shares also in 'eternal', but incidentally; for 'the double' 
<A NAME="285"></A>happens to be eternal.) Therefore the Forms will be substance. But the 
<A NAME="286"></A>same names indicate substance in this and in the ideal world (or what will 
<A NAME="287"></A>be the meaning of saying that there is something apart from the particulars-the 
<A NAME="288"></A>one over many?). And if the Ideas and the things that share in them have 
<A NAME="289"></A>the same form, there will be something common: for why should '2' be one 
<A NAME="290"></A>and the same in the perishable 2's, or in the 2's which are many but eternal, 
<A NAME="291"></A>and not the same in the '2 itself' as in the individual 2? But if they 
<A NAME="292"></A>have not the same form, they will have only the name in common, and it 
<A NAME="293"></A>is as if one were to call both Callias and a piece of wood a 'man', without 
<A NAME="294"></A>observing any community between them. <BR><BR>"But if we are to suppose 
<A NAME="295"></A>that in other respects the common definitions apply to the Forms, e.g. 
<A NAME="296"></A>that 'plane figure' and the other parts of the definition apply to the 
<A NAME="297"></A>circle itself, but 'what really is' has to be added, we must inquire whether 
<A NAME="298"></A>this is not absolutely meaningless. For to what is this to be added? To 
<A NAME="299"></A>'centre' or to 'plane' or to all the parts of the definition? For all the 
<A NAME="300"></A>elements in the essence are Ideas, e.g. 'animal' and 'two-footed'. Further, 
<A NAME="301"></A>there must be some Ideal answering to 'plane' above, some nature which 
<A NAME="302"></A>will be present in all the Forms as their genus.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="303"></A><B>Part 5</B>
<A NAME="304"></A>"<BR><BR>
<A NAME="305"></A><BR><BR>"Above all one might discuss the question what in the world the 
<A NAME="306"></A>Forms contribute to sensible things, either to those that are eternal or 
<A NAME="307"></A>to those that come into being and cease to be; for they cause neither movement 
<A NAME="308"></A>nor any change in them. But again they help in no wise either towards the 
<A NAME="309"></A>knowledge of other things (for they are not even the substance of these, 
<A NAME="310"></A>else they would have been in them), or towards their being, if they are 
<A NAME="311"></A>not in the individuals which share in them; though if they were, they might 
<A NAME="312"></A>be thought to be causes, as white causes whiteness in a white object by 
<A NAME="313"></A>entering into its composition. But this argument, which was used first 
<A NAME="314"></A>by Anaxagoras, and later by Eudoxus in his discussion of difficulties and 
<A NAME="315"></A>by certain others, is very easily upset; for it is easy to collect many 
<A NAME="316"></A>and insuperable objections to such a view. <BR><BR>"But, further, all other 
<A NAME="317"></A>things cannot come from the Forms in any of the usual senses of 'from'. 
<A NAME="318"></A>And to say that they are patterns and the other things share in them is 
<A NAME="319"></A>to use empty words and poetical metaphors. For what is it that works, looking 
<A NAME="320"></A>to the Ideas? And any thing can both be and come into being without being 
<A NAME="321"></A>copied from something else, so that, whether Socrates exists or not, a 
<A NAME="322"></A>man like Socrates might come to be. And evidently this might be so even 
<A NAME="323"></A>if Socrates were eternal. And there will be several patterns of the same 
<A NAME="324"></A>thing, and therefore several Forms; e.g. 'animal' and 'two-footed', and 
<A NAME="325"></A>also 'man-himself', will be Forms of man. Again, the Forms are patterns 
<A NAME="326"></A>not only of sensible things, but of Forms themselves also; i.e. the genus 
<A NAME="327"></A>is the pattern of the various forms-of-a-genus; therefore the same thing 
<A NAME="328"></A>will be pattern and copy. <BR><BR>"Again, it would seem impossible that 
<A NAME="329"></A>substance and that whose substance it is should exist apart; how, therefore, 
<A NAME="330"></A>could the Ideas, being the substances of things, exist apart? <BR><BR>"In 
<A NAME="331"></A>the Phaedo the case is stated in this way-that the Forms are causes both 
<A NAME="332"></A>of being and of becoming. Yet though the Forms exist, still things do not 
<A NAME="333"></A>come into being, unless there is something to originate movement; and many 
<A NAME="334"></A>other things come into being (e.g. a house or a ring) of which they say 
<A NAME="335"></A>there are no Forms. Clearly therefore even the things of which they say 
<A NAME="336"></A>there are Ideas can both be and come into being owing to such causes as 
<A NAME="337"></A>produce the things just mentioned, and not owing to the Forms. But regarding 
<A NAME="338"></A>the Ideas it is possible, both in this way and by more abstract and accurate 
<A NAME="339"></A>arguments, to collect many objections like those we have 
<A NAME="340"></A>considered.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="341"></A><B>Part 6</B>
<A NAME="342"></A>"<BR><BR>
<A NAME="343"></A><BR><BR>"Since we have discussed these points, it is well to consider again 
<A NAME="344"></A>the results regarding numbers which confront those who say that numbers 
<A NAME="345"></A>are separable substances and first causes of things. If number is an entity 
<A NAME="346"></A>and its substance is nothing other than just number, as some say, it follows 
<A NAME="347"></A>that either (1) there is a first in it and a second, each being different 
<A NAME="348"></A>in species,-and either (a) this is true of the units without exception, 
<A NAME="349"></A>and any unit is inassociable with any unit, or (b) they are all without 
<A NAME="350"></A>exception successive, and any of them are associable with any, as they 
<A NAME="351"></A>say is the case with mathematical number; for in mathematical number no 
<A NAME="352"></A>one unit is in any way different from another. Or (c) some units must be 
<A NAME="353"></A>associable and some not; e.g. suppose that 2 is first after 1, and then 
<A NAME="354"></A>comes 3 and then the rest of the number series, and the units in each number 
<A NAME="355"></A>are associable, e.g. those in the first 2 are associable with one another, 
<A NAME="356"></A>and those in the first 3 with one another, and so with the other numbers; 
<A NAME="357"></A>but the units in the '2-itself' are inassociable with those in the '3-itself'; 
<A NAME="358"></A>and similarly in the case of the other successive numbers. And so while 
<A NAME="359"></A>mathematical number is counted thus-after 1, 2 (which consists of another 
<A NAME="360"></A>1 besides the former 1), and 3 which consists of another 1 besides these 
<A NAME="361"></A>two), and the other numbers similarly, ideal number is counted thus-after 
<A NAME="362"></A>1, a distinct 2 which does not include the first 1, and a 3 which does 
<A NAME="363"></A>not include the 2 and the rest of the number series similarly. Or (2) one 
<A NAME="364"></A>kind of number must be like the first that was named, one like that which 
<A NAME="365"></A>the mathematicians speak of, and that which we have named last must be 
<A NAME="366"></A>a third kind. <BR><BR>"Again, these kinds of numbers must either be separable 
<A NAME="367"></A>from things, or not separable but in objects of perception (not however 
<A NAME="368"></A>in the way which we first considered, in the sense that objects of perception 
<A NAME="369"></A>consists of numbers which are present in them)-either one kind and not 
<A NAME="370"></A>another, or all of them. <BR><BR>"These are of necessity the only ways 
<A NAME="371"></A>in which the numbers can exist. And of those who say that the 1 is the 
<A NAME="372"></A>beginning and substance and element of all things, and that number is formed 
<A NAME="373"></A>from the 1 and something else, almost every one has described number in 
<A NAME="374"></A>one of these ways; only no one has said all the units are inassociable. 
<A NAME="375"></A>And this has happened reasonably enough; for there can be no way besides 
<A NAME="376"></A>those mentioned. Some say both kinds of number exist, that which has a 
<A NAME="377"></A>before and after being identical with the Ideas, and mathematical number 
<A NAME="378"></A>being different from the Ideas and from sensible things, and both being 
<A NAME="379"></A>separable from sensible things; and others say mathematical number alone 
<A NAME="380"></A>exists, as the first of realities, separate from sensible things. And the 
<A NAME="381"></A>Pythagoreans, also, believe in one kind of number-the mathematical; only 
<A NAME="382"></A>they say it is not separate but sensible substances are formed out of it. 
<A NAME="383"></A>For they construct the whole universe out of numbers-only not numbers consisting 
<A NAME="384"></A>of abstract units; they suppose the units to have spatial magnitude. But 
<A NAME="385"></A>how the first 1 was constructed so as to have magnitude, they seem unable 
<A NAME="386"></A>to say. <BR><BR>"Another thinker says the first kind of number, that of 
<A NAME="387"></A>the Forms, alone exists, and some say mathematical number is identical 
<A NAME="388"></A>with this. <BR><BR>"The case of lines, planes, and solids is similar. For 
<A NAME="389"></A>some think that those which are the objects of mathematics are different 
<A NAME="390"></A>from those which come after the Ideas; and of those who express themselves 
<A NAME="391"></A>otherwise some speak of the objects of mathematics and in a mathematical 
<A NAME="392"></A>way-viz. those who do not make the Ideas numbers nor say that Ideas exist; 
<A NAME="393"></A>and others speak of the objects of mathematics, but not mathematically; 
<A NAME="394"></A>for they say that neither is every spatial magnitude divisible into magnitudes, 
<A NAME="395"></A>nor do any two units taken at random make 2. All who say the 1 is an element 
<A NAME="396"></A>and principle of things suppose numbers to consist of abstract units, except 
<A NAME="397"></A>the Pythagoreans; but they suppose the numbers to have magnitude, as has 
<A NAME="398"></A>been said before. It is clear from this statement, then, in how many ways 
<A NAME="399"></A>numbers may be described, and that all the ways have been mentioned; and 
<A NAME="400"></A>all these views are impossible, but some perhaps more than 
<A NAME="401"></A>others.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="402"></A><B>Part 7</B>
<A NAME="403"></A>"<BR><BR>
<A NAME="404"></A><BR><BR>"First, then, let us inquire if the units are associable or inassociable, 
<A NAME="405"></A>and if inassociable, in which of the two ways we distinguished. For it 
<A NAME="406"></A>is possible that any unity is inassociable with any, and it is possible 
<A NAME="407"></A>that those in the 'itself' are inassociable with those in the 'itself', 
<A NAME="408"></A>and, generally, that those in each ideal number are inassociable with those 
<A NAME="409"></A>in other ideal numbers. Now (1) all units are associable and without difference, 
<A NAME="410"></A>we get mathematical number-only one kind of number, and the Ideas cannot 
<A NAME="411"></A>be the numbers. For what sort of number will man-himself or animal-itself 
<A NAME="412"></A>or any other Form be? There is one Idea of each thing e.g. one of man-himself 
<A NAME="413"></A>and another one of animal-itself; but the similar and undifferentiated 
<A NAME="414"></A>numbers are infinitely many, so that any particular 3 is no more man-himself 
<A NAME="415"></A>than any other 3. But if the Ideas are not numbers, neither can they exist 
<A NAME="416"></A>at all. For from what principles will the Ideas come? It is number that 
<A NAME="417"></A>comes from the 1 and the indefinite dyad, and the principles or elements 
<A NAME="418"></A>are said to be principles and elements of number, and the Ideas cannot 
<A NAME="419"></A>be ranked as either prior or posterior to the numbers. <BR><BR>"But (2) 
<A NAME="420"></A>if the units are inassociable, and inassociable in the sense that any is 
<A NAME="421"></A>inassociable with any other, number of this sort cannot be mathematical 
<A NAME="422"></A>number; for mathematical number consists of undifferentiated units, and 
<A NAME="423"></A>the truths proved of it suit this character. Nor can it be ideal number. 
<A NAME="424"></A>For 2 will not proceed immediately from 1 and the indefinite dyad, and 
<A NAME="425"></A>be followed by the successive numbers, as they say '2,3,4' for the units 
<A NAME="426"></A>in the ideal are generated at the same time, whether, as the first holder 
<A NAME="427"></A>of the theory said, from unequals (coming into being when these were equalized) 
<A NAME="428"></A>or in some other way-since, if one unit is to be prior to the other, it 
<A NAME="429"></A>will be prior also to 2 the composed of these; for when there is one thing 
<A NAME="430"></A>prior and another posterior, the resultant of these will be prior to one 
<A NAME="431"></A>and posterior to the other.  Again, since the 1-itself is first, and then 
<A NAME="432"></A>there is a particular 1 which is first among the others and next after 
<A NAME="433"></A>the 1-itself, and again a third which is next after the second and next 
<A NAME="434"></A>but one after the first 1,-so the units must be prior to the numbers after 
<A NAME="435"></A>which they are named when we count them; e.g. there will be a third unit 
<A NAME="436"></A>in 2 before 3 exists, and a fourth and a fifth in 3 before the numbers 
<A NAME="437"></A>4 and 5 exist.-Now none of these thinkers has said the units are inassociable 
<A NAME="438"></A>in this way, but according to their principles it is reasonable that they 
<A NAME="439"></A>should be so even in this way, though in truth it is impossible. For it 
<A NAME="440"></A>is reasonable both that the units should have priority and posteriority 
<A NAME="441"></A>if there is a first unit or first 1, and also that the 2's should if there 
<A NAME="442"></A>is a first 2; for after the first it is reasonable and necessary that there 
<A NAME="443"></A>should be a second, and if a second, a third, and so with the others successively. 
<A NAME="444"></A>(And to say both things at the same time, that a unit is first and another 
<A NAME="445"></A>unit is second after the ideal 1, and that a 2 is first after it, is impossible.) 
<A NAME="446"></A>But they make a first unit or 1, but not also a second and a third, and 
<A NAME="447"></A>a first 2, but not also a second and a third. Clearly, also, it is not 
<A NAME="448"></A>possible, if all the units are inassociable, that there should be a 2-itself 
<A NAME="449"></A>and a 3-itself; and so with the other numbers. For whether the units are 
<A NAME="450"></A>undifferentiated or different each from each, number must be counted by 
<A NAME="451"></A>addition, e.g. 2 by adding another 1 to the one, 3 by adding another 1 
<A NAME="452"></A>to the two, and similarly. This being so, numbers cannot be generated as 
<A NAME="453"></A>they generate them, from the 2 and the 1; for 2 becomes part of 3 and 3 
<A NAME="454"></A>of 4 and the same happens in the case of the succeeding numbers, but they 
<A NAME="455"></A>say 4 came from the first 2 and the indefinite which makes it two 2's other 
<A NAME="456"></A>than the 2-itself; if not, the 2-itself will be a part of 4 and one other 
<A NAME="457"></A>2 will be added. And similarly 2 will consist of the 1-itself and another 
<A NAME="458"></A>1; but if this is so, the other element cannot be an indefinite 2; for 
<A NAME="459"></A>it generates one unit, not, as the indefinite 2 does, a definite 2. <BR><BR>"Again, 
<A NAME="460"></A>besides the 3-itself and the 2-itself how can there be other 3's and 2's? 
<A NAME="461"></A>And how do they consist of prior and posterior units? All this is absurd 
<A NAME="462"></A>and fictitious, and there cannot be a first 2 and then a 3-itself. Yet 
<A NAME="463"></A>there must, if the 1 and the indefinite dyad are to be the elements. But 
<A NAME="464"></A>if the results are impossible, it is also impossible that these are the 
<A NAME="465"></A>generating principles. <BR><BR>"If the units, then, are differentiated, 
<A NAME="466"></A>each from each, these results and others similar to these follow of necessity. 
<A NAME="467"></A>But (3) if those in different numbers are differentiated, but those in 
<A NAME="468"></A>the same number are alone undifferentiated from one another, even so the 
<A NAME="469"></A>difficulties that follow are no less. E.g. in the 10-itself their are ten 
<A NAME="470"></A>units, and the 10 is composed both of them and of two 5's. But since the 
<A NAME="471"></A>10-itself is not any chance number nor composed of any chance 5's--or, 
<A NAME="472"></A>for that matter, units--the units in this 10 must differ. For if they do 
<A NAME="473"></A>not differ, neither will the 5's of which the 10 consists differ; but since 
<A NAME="474"></A>these differ, the units also will differ. But if they differ, will there 
<A NAME="475"></A>be no other 5's in the 10 but only these two, or will there be others? 
<A NAME="476"></A>If there are not, this is paradoxical; and if there are, what sort of 10 
<A NAME="477"></A>will consist of them? For there is no other in the 10 but the 10 itself. 
<A NAME="478"></A>But it is actually necessary on their view that the 4 should not consist 
<A NAME="479"></A>of any chance 2's; for the indefinite as they say, received the definite 
<A NAME="480"></A>2 and made two 2's; for its nature was to double what it received. <BR><BR>"Again, 
<A NAME="481"></A>as to the 2 being an entity apart from its two units, and the 3 an entity 
<A NAME="482"></A>apart from its three units, how is this possible? Either by one's sharing 
<A NAME="483"></A>in the other, as 'pale man' is different from 'pale' and 'man' (for it 
<A NAME="484"></A>shares in these), or when one is a differentia of the other, as 'man' is 
<A NAME="485"></A>different from 'animal' and 'two-footed'. <BR><BR>"Again, some things are 
<A NAME="486"></A>one by contact, some by intermixture, some by position; none of which can 
<A NAME="487"></A>belong to the units of which the 2 or the 3 consists; but as two men are 
<A NAME="488"></A>not a unity apart from both, so must it be with the units. And their being 
<A NAME="489"></A>indivisible will make no difference to them; for points too are indivisible, 
<A NAME="490"></A>but yet a pair of them is nothing apart from the two. <BR><BR>"But this 
<A NAME="491"></A>consequence also we must not forget, that it follows that there are prior 
<A NAME="492"></A>and posterior 2 and similarly with the other numbers. For let the 2's in 
<A NAME="493"></A>the 4 be simultaneous; yet these are prior to those in the 8 and as the 
<A NAME="494"></A>2 generated them, they generated the 4's in the 8-itself. Therefore if 
<A NAME="495"></A>the first 2 is an Idea, these 2's also will be Ideas of some kind. And 
<A NAME="496"></A>the same account applies to the units; for the units in the first 2 generate 
<A NAME="497"></A>the four in 4, so that all the units come to be Ideas and an Idea will 
<A NAME="498"></A>be composed of Ideas. Clearly therefore those things also of which these 
<A NAME="499"></A>happen to be the Ideas will be composite, e.g. one might say that animals 
<A NAME="500"></A>are composed of animals, if there are Ideas of them. <BR><BR>"In general, 
<A NAME="501"></A>to differentiate the units in any way is an absurdity and a fiction; and 
<A NAME="502"></A>by a fiction I mean a forced statement made to suit a hypothesis. For neither 
<A NAME="503"></A>in quantity nor in quality do we see unit differing from unit, and number 
<A NAME="504"></A>must be either equal or unequal-all number but especially that which consists 
<A NAME="505"></A>of abstract units-so that if one number is neither greater nor less than 
<A NAME="506"></A>another, it is equal to it; but things that are equal and in no wise differentiated 
<A NAME="507"></A>we take to be the same when we are speaking of numbers. If not, not even 
<A NAME="508"></A>the 2 in the 10-itself will be undifferentiated, though they are equal; 
<A NAME="509"></A>for what reason will the man who alleges that they are not differentiated 
<A NAME="510"></A>be able to give? <BR><BR>"Again, if every unit + another unit makes two, 
<A NAME="511"></A>a unit from the 2-itself and one from the 3-itself will make a 2. Now (a) 
<A NAME="512"></A>this will consist of differentiated units; and will it be prior to the 
<A NAME="513"></A>3 or posterior? It rather seems that it must be prior; for one of the units 
<A NAME="514"></A>is simultaneous with the 3 and the other is simultaneous with the 2. And 
<A NAME="515"></A>we, for our part, suppose that in general 1 and 1, whether the things are 
<A NAME="516"></A>equal or unequal, is 2, e.g. the good and the bad, or a man and a horse; 
<A NAME="517"></A>but those who hold these views say that not even two units are 2. <BR><BR>"If 
<A NAME="518"></A>the number of the 3-itself is not greater than that of the 2, this is surprising; 
<A NAME="519"></A>and if it is greater, clearly there is also a number in it equal to the 
<A NAME="520"></A>2, so that this is not different from the 2-itself. But this is not possible, 
<A NAME="521"></A>if there is a first and a second number. <BR><BR>"Nor will the Ideas be 
<A NAME="522"></A>numbers. For in this particular point they are right who claim that the 
<A NAME="523"></A>units must be different, if there are to be Ideas; as has been said before. 
<A NAME="524"></A>For the Form is unique; but if the units are not different, the 2's and 
<A NAME="525"></A>the 3's also will not be different. This is also the reason why they must 
<A NAME="526"></A>say that when we count thus-'1,2'-we do not proceed by adding to the given 
<A NAME="527"></A>number; for if we do, neither will the numbers be generated from the indefinite 
<A NAME="528"></A>dyad, nor can a number be an Idea; for then one Idea will be in another, 
<A NAME="529"></A>and all Forms will be parts of one Form. And so with a view to their hypothesis 
<A NAME="530"></A>their statements are right, but as a whole they are wrong; for their view 
<A NAME="531"></A>is very destructive, since they will admit that this question itself affords 
<A NAME="532"></A>some difficulty-whether, when we count and say -1,2,3-we count by addition 
<A NAME="533"></A>or by separate portions. But we do both; and so it is absurd to reason 
<A NAME="534"></A>back from this problem to so great a difference of essence.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="535"></A><B>Part 8</B>
<A NAME="536"></A>"<BR><BR>
<A NAME="537"></A><BR><BR>"First of all it is well to determine what is the differentia of 
<A NAME="538"></A>a number-and of a unit, if it has a differentia. Units must differ either 
<A NAME="539"></A>in quantity or in quality; and neither of these seems to be possible. But 
<A NAME="540"></A>number qua number differs in quantity. And if the units also did differ 
<A NAME="541"></A>in quantity, number would differ from number, though equal in number of 
<A NAME="542"></A>units. Again, are the first units greater or smaller, and do the later 
<A NAME="543"></A>ones increase or diminish? All these are irrational suppositions. But neither 
<A NAME="544"></A>can they differ in quality. For no attribute can attach to them; for even 
<A NAME="545"></A>to numbers quality is said to belong after quantity. Again, quality could 
<A NAME="546"></A>not come to them either from the 1 or the dyad; for the former has no quality, 
<A NAME="547"></A>and the latter gives quantity; for this entity is what makes things to 
<A NAME="548"></A>be many. If the facts are really otherwise, they should state this quite 
<A NAME="549"></A>at the beginning and determine if possible, regarding the differentia of 
<A NAME="550"></A>the unit, why it must exist, and, failing this, what differentia they mean. 
<A NAME="551"></A><BR><BR>"Evidently then, if the Ideas are numbers, the units cannot all 
<A NAME="552"></A>be associable, nor can they be inassociable in either of the two ways. 
<A NAME="553"></A>But neither is the way in which some others speak about numbers correct. 
<A NAME="554"></A>These are those who do not think there are Ideas, either without qualification 
<A NAME="555"></A>or as identified with certain numbers, but think the objects of mathematics 
<A NAME="556"></A>exist and the numbers are the first of existing things, and the 1-itself 
<A NAME="557"></A>is the starting-point of them. It is paradoxical that there should be a 
<A NAME="558"></A>1 which is first of 1's, as they say, but not a 2 which is first of 2's, 
<A NAME="559"></A>nor a 3 of 3's; for the same reasoning applies to all. If, then, the facts 
<A NAME="560"></A>with regard to number are so, and one supposes mathematical number alone 
<A NAME="561"></A>to exist, the 1 is not the starting-point (for this sort of 1 must differ 
<A NAME="562"></A>from the-other units; and if this is so, there must also be a 2 which is 
<A NAME="563"></A>first of 2's, and similarly with the other successive numbers). But if 
<A NAME="564"></A>the 1 is the starting-point, the truth about the numbers must rather be 
<A NAME="565"></A>what Plato used to say, and there must be a first 2 and 3 and numbers must 
<A NAME="566"></A>not be associable with one another. But if on the other hand one supposes 
<A NAME="567"></A>this, many impossible results, as we have said, follow. But either this 
<A NAME="568"></A>or the other must be the case, so that if neither is, number cannot exist 
<A NAME="569"></A>separately. <BR><BR>"It is evident, also, from this that the third version 
<A NAME="570"></A>is the worst,-the view ideal and mathematical number is the same. For two 
<A NAME="571"></A>mistakes must then meet in the one opinion. (1) Mathematical number cannot 
<A NAME="572"></A>be of this sort, but the holder of this view has to spin it out by making 
<A NAME="573"></A>suppositions peculiar to himself. And (2) he must also admit all the consequences 
<A NAME="574"></A>that confront those who speak of number in the sense of 'Forms'. <BR><BR>"The 
<A NAME="575"></A>Pythagorean version in one way affords fewer difficulties than those before 
<A NAME="576"></A>named, but in another way has others peculiar to itself. For not thinking 
<A NAME="577"></A>of number as capable of existing separately removes many of the impossible 
<A NAME="578"></A>consequences; but that bodies should be composed of numbers, and that this 
<A NAME="579"></A>should be mathematical number, is impossible. For it is not true to speak 
<A NAME="580"></A>of indivisible spatial magnitudes; and however much there might be magnitudes 
<A NAME="581"></A>of this sort, units at least have not magnitude; and how can a magnitude 
<A NAME="582"></A>be composed of indivisibles? But arithmetical number, at least, consists 
<A NAME="583"></A>of units, while these thinkers identify number with real things; at any 
<A NAME="584"></A>rate they apply their propositions to bodies as if they consisted of those 
<A NAME="585"></A>numbers. <BR><BR>"If, then, it is necessary, if number is a self-subsistent 
<A NAME="586"></A>real thing, that it should exist in one of these ways which have been mentioned, 
<A NAME="587"></A>and if it cannot exist in any of these, evidently number has no such nature 
<A NAME="588"></A>as those who make it separable set up for it. <BR><BR>"Again, does each 
<A NAME="589"></A>unit come from the great and the small, equalized, or one from the small, 
<A NAME="590"></A>another from the great? (a) If the latter, neither does each thing contain 
<A NAME="591"></A>all the elements, nor are the units without difference; for in one there 
<A NAME="592"></A>is the great and in another the small, which is contrary in its nature 
<A NAME="593"></A>to the great. Again, how is it with the units in the 3-itself? One of them 
<A NAME="594"></A>is an odd unit. But perhaps it is for this reason that they give 1-itself 
<A NAME="595"></A>the middle place in odd numbers. (b) But if each of the two units consists 
<A NAME="596"></A>of both the great and the small, equalized, how will the 2 which is a single 
<A NAME="597"></A>thing, consist of the great and the small? Or how will it differ from the 
<A NAME="598"></A>unit? Again, the unit is prior to the 2; for when it is destroyed the 2 
<A NAME="599"></A>is destroyed. It must, then, be the Idea of an Idea since it is prior to 
<A NAME="600"></A>an Idea, and it must have come into being before it. From what, then? Not 
<A NAME="601"></A>from the indefinite dyad, for its function was to double. <BR><BR>"Again, 
<A NAME="602"></A>number must be either infinite or finite; for these thinkers think of number 
<A NAME="603"></A>as capable of existing separately, so that it is not possible that neither 
<A NAME="604"></A>of those alternatives should be true. Clearly it cannot be infinite; for 
<A NAME="605"></A>infinite number is neither odd nor even, but the generation of numbers 
<A NAME="606"></A>is always the generation either of an odd or of an even number; in one 
<A NAME="607"></A>way, when 1 operates on an even number, an odd number is produced; in another 
<A NAME="608"></A>way, when 2 operates, the numbers got from 1 by doubling are produced; 
<A NAME="609"></A>in another way, when the odd numbers operate, the other even numbers are 
<A NAME="610"></A>produced. Again, if every Idea is an Idea of something, and the numbers 
<A NAME="611"></A>are Ideas, infinite number itself will be an Idea of something, either 
<A NAME="612"></A>of some sensible thing or of something else. Yet this is not possible in 
<A NAME="613"></A>view of their thesis any more than it is reasonable in itself, at least 
<A NAME="614"></A>if they arrange the Ideas as they do. <BR><BR>"But if number is finite, 
<A NAME="615"></A>how far does it go? With regard to this not only the fact but the reason 
<A NAME="616"></A>should be stated. But if number goes only up to 10 as some say, firstly 
<A NAME="617"></A>the Forms will soon run short; e.g. if 3 is man-himself, what number will 
<A NAME="618"></A>be the horse-itself? The series of the numbers which are the several things-themselves 
<A NAME="619"></A>goes up to 10. It must, then, be one of the numbers within these limits; 
<A NAME="620"></A>for it is these that are substances and Ideas. Yet they will run short; 
<A NAME="621"></A>for the various forms of animal will outnumber them. At the same time it 
<A NAME="622"></A>is clear that if in this way the 3 is man-himself, the other 3's are so 
<A NAME="623"></A>also (for those in identical numbers are similar), so that there will be 
<A NAME="624"></A>an infinite number of men; if each 3 is an Idea, each of the numbers will 
<A NAME="625"></A>be man-himself, and if not, they will at least be men. And if the smaller 
<A NAME="626"></A>number is part of the greater (being number of such a sort that the units 
<A NAME="627"></A>in the same number are associable), then if the 4-itself is an Idea of 
<A NAME="628"></A>something, e.g. of 'horse' or of 'white', man will be a part of horse, 
<A NAME="629"></A>if man is It is paradoxical also that there should be an Idea of 10 but 
<A NAME="630"></A>not of 11, nor of the succeeding numbers. Again, there both are and come 
<A NAME="631"></A>to be certain things of which there are no Forms; why, then, are there 
<A NAME="632"></A>not Forms of them also? We infer that the Forms are not causes. Again, 
<A NAME="633"></A>it is paradoxical-if the number series up to 10 is more of a real thing 
<A NAME="634"></A>and a Form than 10 itself. There is no generation of the former as one 
<A NAME="635"></A>thing, and there is of the latter. But they try to work on the assumption 
<A NAME="636"></A>that the series of numbers up to 10 is a complete series. At least they 
<A NAME="637"></A>generate the derivatives-e.g. the void, proportion, the odd, and the others 
<A NAME="638"></A>of this kind-within the decade. For some things, e.g. movement and rest, 
<A NAME="639"></A>good and bad, they assign to the originative principles, and the others 
<A NAME="640"></A>to the numbers. This is why they identify the odd with 1; for if the odd 
<A NAME="641"></A>implied 3 how would 5 be odd? Again, spatial magnitudes and all such things 
<A NAME="642"></A>are explained without going beyond a definite number; e.g. the first, the 
<A NAME="643"></A>indivisible, line, then the 2 &c.; these entities also extend only up to 
<A NAME="644"></A>10. <BR><BR>"Again, if number can exist separately, one might ask which 
<A NAME="645"></A>is prior- 1, or 3 or 2? Inasmuch as the number is composite, 1 is prior, 
<A NAME="646"></A>but inasmuch as the universal and the form is prior, the number is prior; 
<A NAME="647"></A>for each of the units is part of the number as its matter, and the number 
<A NAME="648"></A>acts as form. And in a sense the right angle is prior to the acute, because 
<A NAME="649"></A>it is determinate and in virtue of its definition; but in a sense the acute 
<A NAME="650"></A>is prior, because it is a part and the right angle is divided into acute 
<A NAME="651"></A>angles. As matter, then, the acute angle and the element and the unit are 
<A NAME="652"></A>prior, but in respect of the form and of the substance as expressed in 
<A NAME="653"></A>the definition, the right angle, and the whole consisting of the matter 
<A NAME="654"></A>and the form, are prior; for the concrete thing is nearer to the form and 
<A NAME="655"></A>to what is expressed in the definition, though in generation it is later. 
<A NAME="656"></A>How then is 1 the starting-point? Because it is not divisiable, they say; 
<A NAME="657"></A>but both the universal, and the particular or the element, are indivisible. 
<A NAME="658"></A>But they are starting-points in different ways, one in definition and the 
<A NAME="659"></A>other in time. In which way, then, is 1 the starting-point? As has been 
<A NAME="660"></A>said, the right angle is thought to be prior to the acute, and the acute 
<A NAME="661"></A>to the right, and each is one. Accordingly they make 1 the starting-point 
<A NAME="662"></A>in both ways. But this is impossible. For the universal is one as form 
<A NAME="663"></A>or substance, while the element is one as a part or as matter. For each 
<A NAME="664"></A>of the two is in a sense one-in truth each of the two units exists potentially 
<A NAME="665"></A>(at least if the number is a unity and not like a heap, i.e. if different 
<A NAME="666"></A>numbers consist of differentiated units, as they say), but not in complete 
<A NAME="667"></A>reality; and the cause of the error they fell into is that they were conducting 
<A NAME="668"></A>their inquiry at the same time from the standpoint of mathematics and from 
<A NAME="669"></A>that of universal definitions, so that (1) from the former standpoint they 
<A NAME="670"></A>treated unity, their first principle, as a point; for the unit is a point 
<A NAME="671"></A>without position. They put things together out of the smallest parts, as 
<A NAME="672"></A>some others also have done. Therefore the unit becomes the matter of numbers 
<A NAME="673"></A>and at the same time prior to 2; and again posterior, 2 being treated as 
<A NAME="674"></A>a whole, a unity, and a form. But (2) because they were seeking the universal 
<A NAME="675"></A>they treated the unity which can be predicated of a number, as in this 
<A NAME="676"></A>sense also a part of the number. But these characteristics cannot belong 
<A NAME="677"></A>at the same time to the same thing. <BR><BR>"If the 1-itself must be unitary 
<A NAME="678"></A>(for it differs in nothing from other 1's except that it is the starting-point), 
<A NAME="679"></A>and the 2 is divisible but the unit is not, the unit must be liker the 
<A NAME="680"></A>1-itself than the 2 is. But if the unit is liker it, it must be liker to 
<A NAME="681"></A>the unit than to the 2; therefore each of the units in 2 must be prior 
<A NAME="682"></A>to the 2. But they deny this; at least they generate the 2 first. Again, 
<A NAME="683"></A>if the 2-itself is a unity and the 3-itself is one also, both form a 2. 
<A NAME="684"></A>From what, then, is this 2 produced?
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="685"></A><B>Part 9</B>
<A NAME="686"></A><BR><BR>"Since there is not contact in numbers, but succession, viz. between 
<A NAME="687"></A>the units between which there is nothing, e.g. between those in 2 or in 
<A NAME="688"></A>3 one might ask whether these succeed the 1-itself or not, and whether, 
<A NAME="689"></A>of the terms that succeed it, 2 or either of the units in 2 is prior. <BR><BR>"Similar 
<A NAME="690"></A>difficulties occur with regard to the classes of things posterior to number,-the 
<A NAME="691"></A>line, the plane, and the solid. For some construct these out of the species 
<A NAME="692"></A>of the 'great and small'; e.g. lines from the 'long and short', planes 
<A NAME="693"></A>from the 'broad and narrow', masses from the 'deep and shallow'; which 
<A NAME="694"></A>are species of the 'great and small'. And the originative principle of 
<A NAME="695"></A>such things which answers to the 1 different thinkers describe in different 
<A NAME="696"></A>ways, And in these also the impossibilities, the fictions, and the contradictions 
<A NAME="697"></A>of all probability are seen to be innumerable. For (i) geometrical classes 
<A NAME="698"></A>are severed from one another, unless the principles of these are implied 
<A NAME="699"></A>in one another in such a way that the 'broad and narrow' is also 'long 
<A NAME="700"></A>and short' (but if this is so, the plane will be line and the solid a plane; 
<A NAME="701"></A>again, how will angles and figures and such things be explained?). And 
<A NAME="702"></A>(ii) the same happens as in regard to number; for 'long and short', &c., 
<A NAME="703"></A>are attributes of magnitude, but magnitude does not consist of these, any 
<A NAME="704"></A>more than the line consists of 'straight and curved', or solids of 'smooth 
<A NAME="705"></A>and rough'. <BR><BR>"(All these views share a difficulty which occurs with 
<A NAME="706"></A>regard to species-of-a-genus, when one posits the universals, viz. whether 
<A NAME="707"></A>it is animal-itself or something other than animal-itself that is in the 
<A NAME="708"></A>particular animal. True, if the universal is not separable from sensible 
<A NAME="709"></A>things, this will present no difficulty; but if the 1 and the numbers are 
<A NAME="710"></A>separable, as those who express these views say, it is not easy to solve 
<A NAME="711"></A>the difficulty, if one may apply the words 'not easy' to the impossible. 
<A NAME="712"></A>For when we apprehend the unity in 2, or in general in a number, do we 
<A NAME="713"></A>apprehend a thing-itself or something else?). <BR><BR>"Some, then, generate 
<A NAME="714"></A>spatial magnitudes from matter of this sort, others from the point -and 
<A NAME="715"></A>the point is thought by them to be not 1 but something like 1-and from 
<A NAME="716"></A>other matter like plurality, but not identical with it; about which principles 
<A NAME="717"></A>none the less the same difficulties occur. For if the matter is one, line 
<A NAME="718"></A>and plane-and soli will be the same; for from the same elements will come 
<A NAME="719"></A>one and the same thing. But if the matters are more than one, and there 
<A NAME="720"></A>is one for the line and a second for the plane and another for the solid, 
<A NAME="721"></A>they either are implied in one another or not, so that the same results 
<A NAME="722"></A>will follow even so; for either the plane will not contain a line or it 
<A NAME="723"></A>will he a line. <BR><BR>"Again, how number can consist of the one and plurality, 
<A NAME="724"></A>they make no attempt to explain; but however they express themselves, the 
<A NAME="725"></A>same objections arise as confront those who construct number out of the 
<A NAME="726"></A>one and the indefinite dyad. For the one view generates number from the 
<A NAME="727"></A>universally predicated plurality, and not from a particular plurality; 
<A NAME="728"></A>and the other generates it from a particular plurality, but the first; 
<A NAME="729"></A>for 2 is said to be a 'first plurality'. Therefore there is practically 
<A NAME="730"></A>no difference, but the same difficulties will follow,-is it intermixture 
<A NAME="731"></A>or position or blending or generation? and so on. Above all one might press 
<A NAME="732"></A>the question 'if each unit is one, what does it come from?' Certainly each 
<A NAME="733"></A>is not the one-itself. It must, then, come from the one itself and plurality, 
<A NAME="734"></A>or a part of plurality. To say that the unit is a plurality is impossible, 
<A NAME="735"></A>for it is indivisible; and to generate it from a part of plurality involves 
<A NAME="736"></A>many other objections; for (a) each of the parts must be indivisible (or 
<A NAME="737"></A>it will be a plurality and the unit will be divisible) and the elements 
<A NAME="738"></A>will not be the one and plurality; for the single units do not come from 
<A NAME="739"></A>plurality and the one. Again, (,the holder of this view does nothing but 
<A NAME="740"></A>presuppose another number; for his plurality of indivisibles is a number. 
<A NAME="741"></A>Again, we must inquire, in view of this theory also, whether the number 
<A NAME="742"></A>is infinite or finite. For there was at first, as it seems, a plurality 
<A NAME="743"></A>that was itself finite, from which and from the one comes the finite number 
<A NAME="744"></A>of units. And there is another plurality that is plurality-itself and infinite 
<A NAME="745"></A>plurality; which sort of plurality, then, is the element which co-operates 
<A NAME="746"></A>with the one? One might inquire similarly about the point, i.e. the element 
<A NAME="747"></A>out of which they make spatial magnitudes. For surely this is not the one 
<A NAME="748"></A>and only point; at any rate, then, let them say out of what each of the 
<A NAME="749"></A>points is formed. Certainly not of some distance + the point-itself. Nor 
<A NAME="750"></A>again can there be indivisible parts of a distance, as the elements out 
<A NAME="751"></A>of which the units are said to be made are indivisible parts of plurality; 
<A NAME="752"></A>for number consists of indivisibles, but spatial magnitudes do not. <BR><BR>"All 
<A NAME="753"></A>these objections, then, and others of the sort make it evident that number 
<A NAME="754"></A>and spatial magnitudes cannot exist apart from things. Again, the discord 
<A NAME="755"></A>about numbers between the various versions is a sign that it is the incorrectness 
<A NAME="756"></A>of the alleged facts themselves that brings confusion into the theories. 
<A NAME="757"></A>For those who make the objects of mathematics alone exist apart from sensible 
<A NAME="758"></A>things, seeing the difficulty about the Forms and their fictitiousness, 
<A NAME="759"></A>abandoned ideal number and posited mathematical. But those who wished to 
<A NAME="760"></A>make the Forms at the same time also numbers, but did not see, if one assumed 
<A NAME="761"></A>these principles, how mathematical number was to exist apart from ideal, 
<A NAME="762"></A>made ideal and mathematical number the same-in words, since in fact mathematical 
<A NAME="763"></A>number has been destroyed; for they state hypotheses peculiar to themselves 
<A NAME="764"></A>and not those of mathematics. And he who first supposed that the Forms 
<A NAME="765"></A>exist and that the Forms are numbers and that the objects of mathematics 
<A NAME="766"></A>exist, naturally separated the two. Therefore it turns out that all of 
<A NAME="767"></A>them are right in some respect, but on the whole not right. And they themselves 
<A NAME="768"></A>confirm this, for their statements do not agree but conflict. The cause 
<A NAME="769"></A>is that their hypotheses and their principles are false. And it is hard 
<A NAME="770"></A>to make a good case out of bad materials, according to Epicharmus: 'as 
<A NAME="771"></A>soon as 'tis said, 'tis seen to be wrong.' <BR><BR>"But regarding numbers 
<A NAME="772"></A>the questions we have raised and the conclusions we have reached are sufficient 
<A NAME="773"></A>(for while he who is already convinced might be further convinced by a 
<A NAME="774"></A>longer discussion, one not yet convinced would not come any nearer to conviction); 
<A NAME="775"></A>regarding the first principles and the first causes and elements, the views 
<A NAME="776"></A>expressed by those who discuss only sensible substance have been partly 
<A NAME="777"></A>stated in our works on nature, and partly do not belong to the present 
<A NAME="778"></A>inquiry; but the views of those who assert that there are other substances 
<A NAME="779"></A>besides the sensible must be considered next after those we have been mentioning. 
<A NAME="780"></A>Since, then, some say that the Ideas and the numbers are such substances, 
<A NAME="781"></A>and that the elements of these are elements and principles of real things, 
<A NAME="782"></A>we must inquire regarding these what they say and in what sense they say 
<A NAME="783"></A>it. <BR><BR>"Those who posit numbers only, and these mathematical, must 
<A NAME="784"></A>be considered later; but as regards those who believe in the Ideas one 
<A NAME="785"></A>might survey at the same time their way of thinking and the difficulty 
<A NAME="786"></A>into which they fall. For they at the same time make the Ideas universal 
<A NAME="787"></A>and again treat them as separable and as individuals. That this is not 
<A NAME="788"></A>possible has been argued before. The reason why those who described their 
<A NAME="789"></A>substances as universal combined these two characteristics in one thing, 
<A NAME="790"></A>is that they did not make substances identical with sensible things. They 
<A NAME="791"></A>thought that the particulars in the sensible world were a state of flux 
<A NAME="792"></A>and none of them remained, but that the universal was apart from these 
<A NAME="793"></A>and something different. And Socrates gave the impulse to this theory, 
<A NAME="794"></A>as we said in our earlier discussion, by reason of his definitions, but 
<A NAME="795"></A>he did not separate universals from individuals; and in this he thought 
<A NAME="796"></A>rightly, in not separating them. This is plain from the results; for without 
<A NAME="797"></A>the universal it is not possible to get knowledge, but the separation is 
<A NAME="798"></A>the cause of the objections that arise with regard to the Ideas. His successors, 
<A NAME="799"></A>however, treating it as necessary, if there are to be any substances besides 
<A NAME="800"></A>the sensible and transient substances, that they must be separable, had 
<A NAME="801"></A>no others, but gave separate existence to these universally predicated 
<A NAME="802"></A>substances, so that it followed that universals and individuals were almost 
<A NAME="803"></A>the same sort of thing. This in itself, then, would be one difficulty in 
<A NAME="804"></A>the view we have mentioned.

<A NAME="805"></A><B>Part 10</B>
<A NAME="806"></A>"<BR><BR>
<A NAME="807"></A><BR><BR>"Let us now mention a point which presents a certain difficulty 
<A NAME="808"></A>both to those who believe in the Ideas and to those who do not, and which 
<A NAME="809"></A>was stated before, at the beginning, among the problems. If we do not suppose 
<A NAME="810"></A>substances to be separate, and in the way in which individual things are 
<A NAME="811"></A>said to be separate, we shall destroy substance in the sense in which we 
<A NAME="812"></A>understand 'substance'; but if we conceive substances to be separable, 
<A NAME="813"></A>how are we to conceive their elements and their principles? <BR><BR>"If 
<A NAME="814"></A>they are individual and not universal, (a) real things will be just of 
<A NAME="815"></A>the same number as the elements, and (b) the elements will not be knowable. 
<A NAME="816"></A>For (a) let the syllables in speech be substances, and their elements elements 
<A NAME="817"></A>of substances; then there must be only one 'ba' and one of each of the 
<A NAME="818"></A>syllables, since they are not universal and the same in form but each is 
<A NAME="819"></A>one in number and a 'this' and not a kind possessed of a common name (and 
<A NAME="820"></A>again they suppose that the 'just what a thing is' is in each case one). 
<A NAME="821"></A>And if the syllables are unique, so too are the parts of which they consist; 
<A NAME="822"></A>there will not, then, be more a's than one, nor more than one of any of 
<A NAME="823"></A>the other elements, on the same principle on which an identical syllable 
<A NAME="824"></A>cannot exist in the plural number. But if this is so, there will not be 
<A NAME="825"></A>other things existing besides the elements, but only the elements. <BR><BR>"(b) 
<A NAME="826"></A>Again, the elements will not be even knowable; for they are not universal, 
<A NAME="827"></A>and knowledge is of universals. This is clear from demonstrations and from 
<A NAME="828"></A>definitions; for we do not conclude that this triangle has its angles equal 
<A NAME="829"></A>to two right angles, unless every triangle has its angles equal to two 
<A NAME="830"></A>right angles, nor that this man is an animal, unless every man is an animal. 
<A NAME="831"></A><BR><BR>"But if the principles are universal, either the substances composed 
<A NAME="832"></A>of them are also universal, or non-substance will be prior to substance; 
<A NAME="833"></A>for the universal is not a substance, but the element or principle is universal, 
<A NAME="834"></A>and the element or principle is prior to the things of which it is the 
<A NAME="835"></A>principle or element. <BR><BR>"All these difficulties follow naturally, 
<A NAME="836"></A>when they make the Ideas out of elements and at the same time claim that 
<A NAME="837"></A>apart from the substances which have the same form there are Ideas, a single 
<A NAME="838"></A>separate entity. But if, e.g. in the case of the elements of speech, the 
<A NAME="839"></A>a's and the b's may quite well be many and there need be no a-itself and 
<A NAME="840"></A>b-itself besides the many, there may be, so far as this goes, an infinite 
<A NAME="841"></A>number of similar syllables. The statement that an knowledge is universal, 
<A NAME="842"></A>so that the principles of things must also be universal and not separate 
<A NAME="843"></A>substances, presents indeed, of all the points we have mentioned, the greatest 
<A NAME="844"></A>difficulty, but yet the statement is in a sense true, although in a sense 
<A NAME="845"></A>it is not. For knowledge, like the verb 'to know', means two things, of 
<A NAME="846"></A>which one is potential and one actual. The potency, being, as matter, universal 
<A NAME="847"></A>and indefinite, deals with the universal and indefinite; but the actuality, 
<A NAME="848"></A>being definite, deals with a definite object, being a 'this', it deals 
<A NAME="849"></A>with a 'this'. But per accidens sight sees universal colour, because this 
<A NAME="850"></A>individual colour which it sees is colour; and this individual a which 
<A NAME="851"></A>the grammarian investigates is an a. For if the principles must be universal, 
<A NAME="852"></A>what is derived from them must also be universal, as in demonstrations; 
<A NAME="853"></A>and if this is so, there will be nothing capable of separate existence-i.e. 
<A NAME="854"></A>no substance. But evidently in a sense knowledge is universal, and in a 
<A NAME="855"></A>sense it is not.
