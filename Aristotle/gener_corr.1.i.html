<A NAME="10"></A><B>Part 1</B>
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="11"></A>Our next task is to study coming-to-be and passing-away. We are to distinguish 
<A NAME="12"></A>the causes, and to state the definitions, of these processes considered 
<A NAME="13"></A>in general-as changes predicable uniformly of all the things that come-to-be 
<A NAME="14"></A>and pass-away by nature. Further, we are to study growth and 'alteration'. 
<A NAME="15"></A>We must inquire what each of them is; and whether 'alteration' is to be 
<A NAME="16"></A>identified with coming-to-be, or whether to these different names there 
<A NAME="17"></A>correspond two separate processes with distinct natures.
<A NAME="18"></A><BR><BR>On this question, indeed, the early philosophers are divided. Some 
<A NAME="19"></A>of them assert that the so-called 'unqualified coming-to-be' is 'alteration', 
<A NAME="20"></A>while others maintain that 'alteration' and coming-to-be are distinct. 
<A NAME="21"></A>For those who say that the universe is one something (i.e. those who generate 
<A NAME="22"></A>all things out of one thing) are bound to assert that coming-to-be is 'alteration', 
<A NAME="23"></A>and that whatever 'comes-to-be' in the proper sense of the term is 'being 
<A NAME="24"></A>altered': but those who make the matter of things more than one must distinguish 
<A NAME="25"></A>coming-to-be from 'alteration'. To this latter class belong Empedocles, 
<A NAME="26"></A>Anaxagoras, and Leucippus. And yet Anaxagoras himself failed to understand 
<A NAME="27"></A>his own utterance. He says, at all events, that coming-to-be and passing-away 
<A NAME="28"></A>are the same as 'being altered':' yet, in common with other thinkers, he 
<A NAME="29"></A>affirms that the elements are many. Thus Empedocles holds that the corporeal 
<A NAME="30"></A>elements are four, while all the elements-including those which initiate 
<A NAME="31"></A>movement-are six in number; whereas Anaxagoras agrees with Leucippus and 
<A NAME="32"></A>Democritus that the elements are infinite.
<A NAME="33"></A><BR><BR>(Anaxagoras posits as elements the 'homoeomeries', viz. bone, flesh, 
<A NAME="34"></A>marrow, and everything else which is such that part and whole are the same 
<A NAME="35"></A>in name and nature; while Democritus and Leucippus say that there are indivisible 
<A NAME="36"></A>bodies, infinite both in number and in the varieties of their shapes, of 
<A NAME="37"></A>which everything else is composed-the compounds differing one from another 
<A NAME="38"></A>according to the shapes, 'positions', and 'groupings' of their 
<A NAME="39"></A>constituents.)
<A NAME="40"></A><BR><BR>For the views of the school of Anaxagoras seem diametrically opposed 
<A NAME="41"></A>to those of the followers of Empedocles. Empedocles says that Fire, Water, 
<A NAME="42"></A>Air, and Earth are four elements, and are thus 'simple' rather than flesh, 
<A NAME="43"></A>bone, and bodies which, like these, are 'homoeomeries'. But the followers 
<A NAME="44"></A>of Anaxagoras regard the 'homoeomeries' as 'simple' and elements, whilst 
<A NAME="45"></A>they affirm that Earth, Fire, Water, and Air are composite; for each of 
<A NAME="46"></A>these is (according to them) a 'common seminary' of all the 
<A NAME="47"></A>'homoeomeries'.
<A NAME="48"></A><BR><BR>Those, then, who construct all things out of a single element, 
<A NAME="49"></A>must maintain that coming-tobe and passing-away are 'alteration'. For they 
<A NAME="50"></A>must affirm that the underlying something always remains identical and 
<A NAME="51"></A>one; and change of such a substratum is what we call 'altering' Those, 
<A NAME="52"></A>on the other hand, who make the ultimate kinds of things more than one, 
<A NAME="53"></A>must maintain that 'alteration' is distinct from coming-to-be: for coming-to-be 
<A NAME="54"></A>and passingaway result from the consilience and the dissolution of the 
<A NAME="55"></A>many kinds. That is why Empedocles too uses language to this effect, when 
<A NAME="56"></A>he says 'There is no coming-to-be of anything, but only a mingling and 
<A NAME="57"></A>a divorce of what has been mingled'. Thus it is clear (i) that to describe 
<A NAME="58"></A>coming-to-be and passing-away in these terms is in accordance with their 
<A NAME="59"></A>fundamental assumption, and (ii) that they do in fact so describe them: 
<A NAME="60"></A>nevertheless, they too must recognize 'alteration' as a fact distinct from 
<A NAME="61"></A>coming to-be, though it is impossible for them to do so consistently with 
<A NAME="62"></A>what they say.
<A NAME="63"></A><BR><BR>That we are right in this criticism is easy to perceive. For 'alteration' 
<A NAME="64"></A>is a fact of observation. While the substance of the thing remains unchanged, 
<A NAME="65"></A>we see it 'altering' just as we see in it the changes of magnitude called 
<A NAME="66"></A>'growth' and 'diminution'. Nevertheless, the statements of those who posit 
<A NAME="67"></A>more 'original reals' than one make 'alteration' impossible. For 'alteration, 
<A NAME="68"></A>as we assert, takes place in respect to certain qualities: and these qualities 
<A NAME="69"></A>(I mean, e.g. hot-cold, white-black, dry-moist, soft-hard, and so forth) 
<A NAME="70"></A>are, all of them, differences characterizing the 'elements'. The actual 
<A NAME="71"></A>words of Empedocles may be quoted in illustration-
<A NAME="72"></A><BR><BR>The sun everywhere bright to see, and hot,
<A NAME="73"></A><BR>The rain everywhere dark and cold; and he distinctively characterizes 
<A NAME="74"></A>his remaining elements in a similar manner. Since, therefore, it is not 
<A NAME="75"></A>possible for Fire to become Water, or Water to become Earth, neither will 
<A NAME="76"></A>it be possible for anything white to become black, or anything soft to 
<A NAME="77"></A>become hard; and the same argument applies to all the other qualities. 
<A NAME="78"></A>Yet this is what 'alteration' essentially is.
<A NAME="79"></A><BR><BR>It follows, as an obvious corollary, that a single matter must 
<A NAME="80"></A>always be assumed as underlying the contrary 'poles' of any change whether 
<A NAME="81"></A>change of place, or growth and diminution, or 'alteration'; further, that 
<A NAME="82"></A>the being of this matter and the being of 'alteration' stand and fall together. 
<A NAME="83"></A>For if the change is 'alteration', then the substratum is a single element; 
<A NAME="84"></A>i.e. all things which admit of change into one another have a single matter. 
<A NAME="85"></A>And, conversely, if the substratum of the changing things is one, there 
<A NAME="86"></A>is 'alteration'.
<A NAME="87"></A><BR><BR>Empedocles, indeed, seems to contradict his own statements as well 
<A NAME="88"></A>as the observed facts. For he denies that any one of his elements comes-to-be 
<A NAME="89"></A>out of any other, insisting on the contrary that they are the things out 
<A NAME="90"></A>of which everything else comes-to-be; and yet (having brought the entirety 
<A NAME="91"></A>of existing things, except Strife, together into one) he maintains, simultaneously 
<A NAME="92"></A>with this denial, that each thing once more comes-to-be out of the One. 
<A NAME="93"></A>Hence it was clearly out of a One that this came-to-be Water, and that 
<A NAME="94"></A>Fire, various portions of it being separated off by certain characteristic 
<A NAME="95"></A>differences or qualities-as indeed he calls the sun 'white and hot', and 
<A NAME="96"></A>the earth 'heavy and hard'. If, therefore, these characteristic differences 
<A NAME="97"></A>be taken away (for they can be taken away, since they came-to-be), it will 
<A NAME="98"></A>clearly be inevitable for Earth to come to-be out of Water and Water out 
<A NAME="99"></A>of Earth, and for each of the other elements to undergo a similar transformation-not 
<A NAME="100"></A>only then, but also now-if, and because, they change their qualities. And, 
<A NAME="101"></A>to judge by what he says, the qualities are such that they can be 'attached' 
<A NAME="102"></A>to things and can again be 'separated' from them, especially since Strife 
<A NAME="103"></A>and Love are still fighting with one another for the mastery. It was owing 
<A NAME="104"></A>to this same conflict that the elements were generated from a One at the 
<A NAME="105"></A>former period. I say 'generated', for presumably Fire, Earth, and Water 
<A NAME="106"></A>had no distinctive existence at all while merged in 
<A NAME="107"></A>one.
<A NAME="108"></A><BR><BR>There is another obscurity in the theory Empedocles. Are we to 
<A NAME="109"></A>regard the One as his 'original real'? Or is it the Many-i.e. Fire and 
<A NAME="110"></A>Earth, and the bodies co-ordinate with these? For the One is an 'element' 
<A NAME="111"></A>in so far as it underlies the process as matter-as that out of which Earth 
<A NAME="112"></A>and Fire come-to-be through a change of qualities due to 'the motion'. 
<A NAME="113"></A>On the other hand, in so far as the One results from composition (by a 
<A NAME="114"></A>consilience of the Many), whereas they result from disintegration the Many 
<A NAME="115"></A>are more 'elementary' than the One, and prior to it in their 
<A NAME="116"></A>nature.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="117"></A><B>Part 2</B>

<A NAME="118"></A><BR><BR>We have therefore to discuss the whole subject of 'unqualified' 
<A NAME="119"></A>coming-to-be and passingaway; we have to inquire whether these changes 
<A NAME="120"></A>do or do not occur and, if they occur, to explain the precise conditions 
<A NAME="121"></A>of their occurrence. We must also discuss the remaining forms of change, 
<A NAME="122"></A>viz. growth and 'alteration'. For though, no doubt, Plato investigated 
<A NAME="123"></A>the conditions under which things come-to-be and pass-away, he confined 
<A NAME="124"></A>his inquiry to these changes; and he discussed not all coming-to-be, but 
<A NAME="125"></A>only that of the elements. He asked no questions as to how flesh or bones, 
<A NAME="126"></A>or any of the other similar compound things, come-to-be; nor again did 
<A NAME="127"></A>he examine the conditions under which 'alteration' or growth are attributable 
<A NAME="128"></A>to things.
<A NAME="129"></A><BR><BR>A similar criticism applies to all our predecessors with the single 
<A NAME="130"></A>exception of Democritus. Not one of them penetrated below the surface or 
<A NAME="131"></A>made a thorough examination of a single one of the problems. Democritus, 
<A NAME="132"></A>however, does seem not only to have thought carefully about all the problems, 
<A NAME="133"></A>but also to be distinguished from the outset by his method. For, as we 
<A NAME="134"></A>are saying, none of the other philosophers made any definite statement 
<A NAME="135"></A>about growth, except such as any amateur might have made. They said that 
<A NAME="136"></A>things grow 'by the accession of like to like', but they did not proceed 
<A NAME="137"></A>to explain the manner of this accession. Nor did they give any account 
<A NAME="138"></A>of 'combination': and they neglected almost every single one of the remaining 
<A NAME="139"></A>problems, offering no explanation, e.g. of 'action' or 'passion' how in 
<A NAME="140"></A>physical actions one thing acts and the other undergoes action. Democritus 
<A NAME="141"></A>and Leucippus, however, postulate the 'figures', and make 'alteration' 
<A NAME="142"></A>and coming-to-be result from them. They explain coming-to-be and passing-away 
<A NAME="143"></A>by their 'dissociation' and 'association', but 'alteration' by their 'grouping' 
<A NAME="144"></A>and 'Position'. And since they thought that the 'truth lay in the appearance, 
<A NAME="145"></A>and the appearances are conflicting and infinitely many, they made the 
<A NAME="146"></A>'figures' infinite in number. Hence-owing to the changes of the compound-the 
<A NAME="147"></A>same thing seems different and conflicting to different people: it is 'transposed' 
<A NAME="148"></A>by a small additional ingredient, and appears utterly other by the 'transposition' 
<A NAME="149"></A>of a single constituent. For Tragedy and Comedy are both composed of the 
<A NAME="150"></A>same letters.
<A NAME="151"></A><BR><BR>Since almost all our predecessors think (i) that coming-to-be is 
<A NAME="152"></A>distinct from 'alteration', and (ii) that, whereas things 'alter' by change 
<A NAME="153"></A>of their qualities, it is by 'association' and 'dissociation' that they 
<A NAME="154"></A>come-to-be and pass-away, we must concentrate our attention on these theses. 
<A NAME="155"></A>For they lead to many perplexing and well-grounded dilemmas. If, on the 
<A NAME="156"></A>one hand, coming-to-be is 'association', many impossible consequences result: 
<A NAME="157"></A>and yet there are other arguments, not easy to unravel, which force the 
<A NAME="158"></A>conclusion upon us that coming-to-be cannot possibly be anything else. 
<A NAME="159"></A>If, on the other hand, coming-to-be is not 'association', either there 
<A NAME="160"></A>is no such thing as coming-to-be at all or it is 'alteration': or else 
<A NAME="161"></A>we must endeavour to unravel this dilemma too-and a stubborn one we shall 
<A NAME="162"></A>find it. The fundamental question, in dealing with all these difficulties, 
<A NAME="163"></A>is this: 'Do things come-to-be and "alter" and grow, and undergo the contrary 
<A NAME="164"></A>changes, because the primary "reals" are indivisible magnitudes? Or is 
<A NAME="165"></A>no magnitude indivisible?' For the answer we give to this question makes 
<A NAME="166"></A>the greatest difference. And again, if the primary 'reals' are indivisible 
<A NAME="167"></A>magnitudes, are these bodies, as Democritus and Leucippus maintain? Or 
<A NAME="168"></A>are they planes, as is asserted in the Timaeus?
<A NAME="169"></A><BR><BR>To resolve bodies into planes and no further-this, as we have also 
<A NAME="170"></A>remarked elsewhere, in itself a paradox. Hence there is more to be said 
<A NAME="171"></A>for the view that there are indivisible bodies. Yet even these involve 
<A NAME="172"></A>much of paradox. Still, as we have said, it is possible to construct 'alteration' 
<A NAME="173"></A>and coming-to-be with them, if one 'transposes' the same by 'turning' and 
<A NAME="174"></A>'intercontact', and by 'the varieties of the figures', as Democritus does. 
<A NAME="175"></A>(His denial of the reality of colour is a corollary from this position: 
<A NAME="176"></A>for, according to him, things get coloured by 'turning' of the 'figures'.) 
<A NAME="177"></A>But the possibility of such a construction no longer exists for those who 
<A NAME="178"></A>divide bodies into planes. For nothing except solids results from putting 
<A NAME="179"></A>planes together: they do not even attempt to generate any quality from 
<A NAME="180"></A>them.
<A NAME="181"></A><BR><BR>Lack of experience diminishes our power of taking a comprehensive 
<A NAME="182"></A>view of the admitted facts. Hence those who dwell in intimate association 
<A NAME="183"></A>with nature and its phenomena grow more and more able to formulate, as 
<A NAME="184"></A>the foundations of their theories, principles such as to admit of a wide 
<A NAME="185"></A>and coherent development: while those whom devotion to abstract discussions 
<A NAME="186"></A>has rendered unobservant of the facts are too ready to dogmatize on the 
<A NAME="187"></A>basis of a few observations. The rival treatments of the subject now before 
<A NAME="188"></A>us will serve to illustrate how great is the difference between a 'scientific' 
<A NAME="189"></A>and a 'dialectical' method of inquiry. For, whereas the Platonists argue 
<A NAME="190"></A>that there must be atomic magnitudes 'because otherwise "The Triangle" 
<A NAME="191"></A>will be more than one', Democritus would appear to have been convinced 
<A NAME="192"></A>by arguments appropriate to the subject, i.e. drawn from the science of 
<A NAME="193"></A>nature. Our meaning will become clear as we proceed. For to suppose that 
<A NAME="194"></A>a body (i.e. a magnitude) is divisible through and through, and that this 
<A NAME="195"></A>division is possible, involves a difficulty. What will there be in the 
<A NAME="196"></A>body which escapes the division?
<A NAME="197"></A><BR><BR>If it is divisible through and through, and if this division is 
<A NAME="198"></A>possible, then it might be, at one and the same moment, divided through 
<A NAME="199"></A>and through, even though the dividings had not been effected simultaneously: 
<A NAME="200"></A>and the actual occurrence of this result would involve no impossibility. 
<A NAME="201"></A>Hence the same principle will apply whenever a body is by nature divisible 
<A NAME="202"></A>through and through, whether by bisection, or generally by any method whatever: 
<A NAME="203"></A>nothing impossible will have resulted if it has actually been divided-not 
<A NAME="204"></A>even if it has been divided into innumerable parts, themselves divided 
<A NAME="205"></A>innumerable times. Nothing impossible will have resulted, though perhaps 
<A NAME="206"></A>nobody in fact could so divide it.
<A NAME="207"></A><BR><BR>Since, therefore, the be dy is divisible through and through, let 
<A NAME="208"></A>it have been divided. What, then, will remain? A magnitude? No: that is 
<A NAME="209"></A>impossible, since then there will be something not divided, whereas ex 
<A NAME="210"></A>hypothesis the body was divisible through and through. But if it be admitted 
<A NAME="211"></A>that neither a body nor a magnitude will remain, and yet division is to 
<A NAME="212"></A>take place, the constituents of the body will either be points (i.e. without 
<A NAME="213"></A>magnitude) or absolutely nothing. If its constituents are nothings, then 
<A NAME="214"></A>it might both come-to-be out of nothings and exist as a composite of nothings: 
<A NAME="215"></A>and thus presumably the whole body will be nothing but an appearance. But 
<A NAME="216"></A>if it consists of points, a similar absurdity will result: it will not 
<A NAME="217"></A>possess any magnitude. For when the points were in contact and coincided 
<A NAME="218"></A>to form a single magnitude, they did not make the whole any bigger (since, 
<A NAME="219"></A>when the body was divided into two or more parts, the whole was not a bit 
<A NAME="220"></A>smaller or bigger than it was before the division): hence, even if all 
<A NAME="221"></A>the points be put together, they will not make any magnitude.
<A NAME="222"></A><BR><BR>But suppose that, as the body is being divided, a minute section-a 
<A NAME="223"></A>piece of sawdust, as it were-is extracted, and that in this sense-a body 
<A NAME="224"></A>'comes away' from the magnitude, evading the division. Even then the same 
<A NAME="225"></A>argument applies. For in what sense is that section divisible? But if what 
<A NAME="226"></A>'came away' was not a body but a separable form or quality, and if the 
<A NAME="227"></A>magnitude is 'points or contacts thus qualified': it is paradoxical that 
<A NAME="228"></A>a magnitude should consist of elements, which are not magnitudes. Moreover, 
<A NAME="229"></A>where will the points be? And are they motionless or moving? And every 
<A NAME="230"></A>contact is always a contact of two somethings, i.e. there is always something 
<A NAME="231"></A>besides the contact or the division or the point.
<A NAME="232"></A><BR><BR>These, then, are the difficulties resulting from the supposition 
<A NAME="233"></A>that any and every body, whatever its size, is divisible through and through. 
<A NAME="234"></A>There is, besides, this further consideration. If, having divided a piece 
<A NAME="235"></A>of wood or anything else, I put it together, it is again equal to what 
<A NAME="236"></A>it was, and is one. Clearly this is so, whatever the point at which I cut 
<A NAME="237"></A>the wood. The wood, therefore, has been divided potentially through and 
<A NAME="238"></A>through. What, then, is there in the wood besides the division? For even 
<A NAME="239"></A>if we suppose there is some quality, yet how is the wood dissolved into 
<A NAME="240"></A>such constituents and how does it come-to-be out of them? Or how are such 
<A NAME="241"></A>constituents separated so as to exist apart from one another? Since, therefore, 
<A NAME="242"></A>it is impossible for magnitudes to consist of contacts or points, there 
<A NAME="243"></A>must be indivisible bodies and magnitudes. Yet, if we do postulate the 
<A NAME="244"></A>latter, we are confronted with equally impossible consequences, which we 
<A NAME="245"></A>have examined in other works.' But we must try to disentangle these perplexities, 
<A NAME="246"></A>and must therefore formulate the whole problem over 
<A NAME="247"></A>again.
<A NAME="248"></A><BR><BR>On the one hand, then, it is in no way paradoxical that every perceptible 
<A NAME="249"></A>body should be indivisible as well as divisible at any and every point. 
<A NAME="250"></A>For the second predicate will at. tach to it potentially, but the first 
<A NAME="251"></A>actually. On the other hand, it would seem to be impossible for a body 
<A NAME="252"></A>to be, even potentially, divisible at all points simultaneously. For if 
<A NAME="253"></A>it were possible, then it might actually occur, with the result, not that 
<A NAME="254"></A>the body would simultaneously be actually both (indivisible and divided), 
<A NAME="255"></A>but that it would be simultaneously divided at any and every point. Consequently, 
<A NAME="256"></A>nothing will remain and the body will have passed-away into what is incorporeal: 
<A NAME="257"></A>and so it might come-to-be again either out of points or absolutely out 
<A NAME="258"></A>of nothing. And how is that possible?
<A NAME="259"></A><BR><BR>But now it is obvious that a body is in fact divided into separable 
<A NAME="260"></A>magnitudes which are smaller at each division-into magnitudes which fall 
<A NAME="261"></A>apart from one another and are actually separated. Hence (it is urged) 
<A NAME="262"></A>the process of dividing a body part by part is not a 'breaking up' which 
<A NAME="263"></A>could continue ad infinitum; nor can a body be simultaneously divided at 
<A NAME="264"></A>every point, for that is not possible; but there is a limit, beyond which 
<A NAME="265"></A>the 'breaking up' cannot proceed. The necessary consequence-especially 
<A NAME="266"></A>if coming-to-be and passing-away are to take place by 'association' and 
<A NAME="267"></A>'dissociation' respectively-is that a body must contain atomic magnitudes 
<A NAME="268"></A>which are invisible. Such is the argument which is believed to establish 
<A NAME="269"></A>the necessity of atomic magnitudes: we must now show that it conceals a 
<A NAME="270"></A>faulty inference, and exactly where it conceals it.
<A NAME="271"></A><BR><BR>For, since point is not 'immediately-next' to point, magnitudes 
<A NAME="272"></A>are 'divisible through and through' in one sense, and yet not in another. 
<A NAME="273"></A>When, however, it is admitted that a magnitude is 'divisible through and 
<A NAME="274"></A>through', it is thought there is a point not only anywhere, but also everywhere, 
<A NAME="275"></A>in it: hence it is supposed to follow, from the admission, that the magnitude 
<A NAME="276"></A>must be divided away into nothing. For it is supposed-there is a point 
<A NAME="277"></A>everywhere within it, so that it consists either of contacts or of points. 
<A NAME="278"></A>But it is only in one sense that the magnitude is 'divisible through and 
<A NAME="279"></A>through', viz. in so far as there is one point anywhere within it and all 
<A NAME="280"></A>its points are everywhere within it if you take them singly one by one. 
<A NAME="281"></A>But there are not more points than one anywhere within it, for the points 
<A NAME="282"></A>are not 'consecutive': hence it is not simultaneously 'divisible through 
<A NAME="283"></A>and through'. For if it were, then, if it be divisible at its centre, it 
<A NAME="284"></A>will be divisible also at a point 'immediately-next' to its centre. But 
<A NAME="285"></A>it is not so divisible: for position is not 'immediately-next' to position, 
<A NAME="286"></A>nor point to point-in other words, division is not 'immediately-next' to 
<A NAME="287"></A>division, nor composition to composition.
<A NAME="288"></A><BR><BR>Hence there are both 'association' and 'dissociation', though neither 
<A NAME="289"></A>(a) into, and out of, atomic magnitudes (for that involves many impossibilities), 
<A NAME="290"></A>nor (b) so that division takes place through and through-for this would 
<A NAME="291"></A>have resulted only if point had been 'immediately-next' to point: but 'dissociation' 
<A NAME="292"></A>takes place into small (i.e. relatively small) parts, and 'association' 
<A NAME="293"></A>takes place out of relatively small parts.
<A NAME="294"></A><BR><BR>It is wrong, however, to suppose, as some assert, that coming-to-be 
<A NAME="295"></A>and passing-away in the unqualified and complete sense are distinctively 
<A NAME="296"></A>defined by 'association' and 'dissociation', while the change that takes 
<A NAME="297"></A>place in what is continuous is 'alteration'. On the contrary, this is where 
<A NAME="298"></A>the whole error lies. For unqualified coming-to-be and passing-away are 
<A NAME="299"></A>not effected by 'association' and 'dissociation'. They take place when 
<A NAME="300"></A>a thing changes, from this to that, as a whole. But the philosophers we 
<A NAME="301"></A>are criticizing suppose that all such change is 'alteration': whereas in 
<A NAME="302"></A>fact there is a difference. For in that which underlies the change there 
<A NAME="303"></A>is a factor corresponding to the definition and there is a material factor. 
<A NAME="304"></A>When, then, the change is in these constitutive factors, there will be 
<A NAME="305"></A>coming-to-be or passing-away: but when it is in the thing's qualities, 
<A NAME="306"></A>i.e. a change of the thing per accidents, there will be 
<A NAME="307"></A>'alteration'.
<A NAME="308"></A><BR><BR>'Dissociation' and 'association' affect the thing's susceptibility 
<A NAME="309"></A>to passing-away. For if water has first been 'dissociated' into smallish 
<A NAME="310"></A>drops, air comes-to-be out of it more quickly: while, if drops of water 
<A NAME="311"></A>have first been 'associated', air comes-to-be more slowly. Our doctrine 
<A NAME="312"></A>will become clearer in the sequel.' Meantime, so much may be taken as established-viz. 
<A NAME="313"></A>that coming-to-be cannot be 'association', at least not the kind of 'association' 
<A NAME="314"></A>some philosophers assert it to be.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="315"></A><B>Part 3</B>

<A NAME="316"></A><BR><BR>Now that we have established the preceding distinctions, we must 
<A NAME="317"></A>first consider whether there is anything which comes-to-be and passes-away 
<A NAME="318"></A>in the unqualified sense: or whether nothing comes-to-be in this strict 
<A NAME="319"></A>sense, but everything always comes-to-be something and out of something-I 
<A NAME="320"></A>mean, e.g. comes-to-be-healthy out of being-ill and ill out of being-healthy, 
<A NAME="321"></A>comes-to-be-small out of being big and big out of being-small, and so on 
<A NAME="322"></A>in every other instance. For if there is to be coming-to-be without qualification, 
<A NAME="323"></A>'something' must-without qualification-'come-to-be out of not-being', so 
<A NAME="324"></A>that it would be true to say that 'not-being is an attribute of some things'. 
<A NAME="325"></A>For qualified coming-to-be is a process out of qualified not-being (e.g. 
<A NAME="326"></A>out of not-white or not-beautiful), but unqualified coming-to-be is a process 
<A NAME="327"></A>out of unqualified not-being.
<A NAME="328"></A><BR><BR>Now 'unqulified' means either (i) the primary predication within 
<A NAME="329"></A>each Category, or (ii) the universal, i.e. the all-comprehensive, predication. 
<A NAME="330"></A>Hence, if'unqualified not-being 'means the negation of 'being' in the sense 
<A NAME="331"></A>of the primary term of the Category in question, we shall have, in 'unqualified 
<A NAME="332"></A>coming-to-be', a coming-to-be of a substance out of not-substance. But 
<A NAME="333"></A>that which is not a substance or a 'this' clearly cannot possess predicates 
<A NAME="334"></A>drawn from any of the other Categories either-e.g. we cannot attribute 
<A NAME="335"></A>to it any quality, quantity, or position. Otherwise, properties would admit 
<A NAME="336"></A>of existence in separation from substances. If, on the other hand, 'unqualified 
<A NAME="337"></A>not-being' means 'what is not in any sense at all', it will be a universal 
<A NAME="338"></A>negation of all forms of being, so that what comes-to-be will have to come-to-be 
<A NAME="339"></A>out of nothing.
<A NAME="340"></A><BR><BR>Although we have dealt with these problems at greater length in 
<A NAME="341"></A>another work,where we have set forth the difficulties and established the 
<A NAME="342"></A>distinguishing definitions, the following concise restatement of our results 
<A NAME="343"></A>must here be offered: In one sense things come-to-be out of that which 
<A NAME="344"></A>has no 'being' without qualification: yet in another sense they come-to-be 
<A NAME="345"></A>always out of what is'. For coming-to-be necessarily implies the pre-existence 
<A NAME="346"></A>of something which potentially 'is', but actually 'is not'; and this something 
<A NAME="347"></A>is spoken of both as 'being' and as 'not-being'.
<A NAME="348"></A><BR><BR>These distinctions may be taken as established: but even then it 
<A NAME="349"></A>is extraordinarily difficult to see how there can be 'unqualified coming-to-be' 
<A NAME="350"></A>(whether we suppose it to occur out of what potentially 'is', or in some 
<A NAME="351"></A>other way), and we must recall this problem for further examination. For 
<A NAME="352"></A>the question might be raised whether substance (i.e. the 'this') comes-to-be 
<A NAME="353"></A>at all. Is it not rather the 'such', the 'so great', or the 'somewhere', 
<A NAME="354"></A>which comes-to-be? And the same question might be raised about 'passing-away' 
<A NAME="355"></A>also. For if a substantial thing comes-to-be, it is clear that there will 
<A NAME="356"></A>'be' (not actually, but potentially) a substance, out of which its coming-to-be 
<A NAME="357"></A>will proceed and into which the thing that is passing-away will necessarily 
<A NAME="358"></A>change. Then will any predicate belonging to the remaining Categories attach 
<A NAME="359"></A>actually to this presupposed substance? In other words, will that which 
<A NAME="360"></A>is only potentially a 'this' (which only potentially is), while without 
<A NAME="361"></A>the qualification 'potentially' it is not a 'this' (i.e. is not), possess, 
<A NAME="362"></A>e.g. any determinate size or quality or position? For (i) if it possesses 
<A NAME="363"></A>none of these determinations actually, but all of them only potentially, 
<A NAME="364"></A>the result is first that a being, which is not a determinate being, is 
<A NAME="365"></A>capable of separate existence; and in addition that coming-to-be proceeds 
<A NAME="366"></A>out of nothing pre-existing-a thesis which, more than any other, preoccupied 
<A NAME="367"></A>and alarmed the earliest philosophers. On the other hand (ii) if, although 
<A NAME="368"></A>it is not a 'this somewhat' or a substance, it is to possess some of the 
<A NAME="369"></A>remaining determinations quoted above, then (as we said)' properties will 
<A NAME="370"></A>be separable from substances.
<A NAME="371"></A><BR><BR>We must therefore concentrate all our powers on the discussion 
<A NAME="372"></A>of these difficulties and on the solution of a further question-viz. What 
<A NAME="373"></A>is the cause of the perpetuity of coming-to-be? Why is there always unqualified, 
<A NAME="374"></A>as well as partial, coming-to-be? Cause' in this connexion has two senses. 
<A NAME="375"></A>It means (i) the source from which, as we say, the process 'originates', 
<A NAME="376"></A>and (ii) the matter. It is the material cause that we have here to state. 
<A NAME="377"></A>For, as to the other cause, we have already explained (in our treatise 
<A NAME="378"></A>on Motion that it involves (a) something immovable through all time and 
<A NAME="379"></A>(b) something always being moved. And the accurate treatment of the first 
<A NAME="380"></A>of these-of the immovable 'originative source'-belongs to the province 
<A NAME="381"></A>of the other, or 'prior', philosophy: while as regards 'that which sets 
<A NAME="382"></A>everything else in motion by being itself continuously moved', we shall 
<A NAME="383"></A>have to explain later' which amongst the so-called 'specific' causes exhibits 
<A NAME="384"></A>this character. But at present we are to state the material cause-the cause 
<A NAME="385"></A>classed under the head of matter-to which it is due that passing-away and 
<A NAME="386"></A>coming-to-be never fail to occur in Nature. For perhaps, if we succeed 
<A NAME="387"></A>in clearing up this question, it will simultaneously become clear what 
<A NAME="388"></A>account we ought to give of that which perplexed us just now, i.e. of unqualified 
<A NAME="389"></A>passingaway and coming-to-be.
<A NAME="390"></A><BR><BR>Our new question too-viz. 'what is the cause of the unbroken continuity 
<A NAME="391"></A>of coming-to-be?'-is sufficiently perplexing, if in fact what passes-away 
<A NAME="392"></A>vanishes into 'what is not' and 'what is not' is nothing (since 'what is 
<A NAME="393"></A>not' is neither a thing, nor possessed of a quality or quantity, nor in 
<A NAME="394"></A>any place). If, then, some one of the things 'which are' constantly disappearing, 
<A NAME="395"></A>why has not the whole of 'what is' been used up long ago and vanished away 
<A NAME="396"></A>assuming of course that the material of all the several comings-to-be was 
<A NAME="397"></A>finite? For, presumably, the unfailing continuity of coming-to-be cannot 
<A NAME="398"></A>be attributed to the infinity of the material. That is impossible, for 
<A NAME="399"></A>nothing is actually infinite. A thing is infinite only potentially, i.e. 
<A NAME="400"></A>the dividing of it can continue indefinitely: so that we should have to 
<A NAME="401"></A>suppose there is only one kind of coming-to-be in the world-viz. one which 
<A NAME="402"></A>never fails, because it is such that what comes-to-be is on each successive 
<A NAME="403"></A>occasion smaller than before. But in fact this is not what we see 
<A NAME="404"></A>occurring.
<A NAME="405"></A><BR><BR>Why, then, is this form of change necessarily ceaseless? Is it 
<A NAME="406"></A>because the passing-away of this is a coming-to-be of something else, and 
<A NAME="407"></A>the coming-to-be of this a passing-away of something 
<A NAME="408"></A>else?
<A NAME="409"></A><BR><BR>The cause implied in this solution must no doubt be considered 
<A NAME="410"></A>adequate to account for coming-to-be and passing-away in their general 
<A NAME="411"></A>character as they occur in all existing things alike. Yet, if the same 
<A NAME="412"></A>process is a coming to-be of this but a passing-away of that, and a passing-away 
<A NAME="413"></A>of this but a coming-to-be of that, why are some things said to come-to-be 
<A NAME="414"></A>and pass-away without qualification, but others only with a 
<A NAME="415"></A>qualification?
<A NAME="416"></A><BR><BR>The distinction must be investigated once more, for it demands 
<A NAME="417"></A>some explanation. (It is applied in a twofold manner.) For (i) we say 'it 
<A NAME="418"></A>is now passing-away' without qualification, and not merely 'this is passing-away': 
<A NAME="419"></A>and we call this change 'coming-to-be', and that 'passing-away', without 
<A NAME="420"></A>qualification. And (ii) so-and-so 'comes-to-be-something', but does not 
<A NAME="421"></A>'come-to-be' without qualification; for we say that the student 'comes-to-be-learned', 
<A NAME="422"></A>not 'comes-to-be' without qualification.
<A NAME="423"></A><BR><BR>(i) Now we often divide terms into those which signify a 'this 
<A NAME="424"></A>somewhat' and those which do not. And (the first form of) the distinction, 
<A NAME="425"></A>which we are investigating, results from a similar division of terms: for 
<A NAME="426"></A>it makes a difference into what the changing thing changes. Perhaps, e.g. 
<A NAME="427"></A>the passage into Fire is 'coming-to-be' unqualified, but 'passingaway-of-something' 
<A NAME="428"></A>(e.g. Earth): whilst the coming-to-be of Earth is qualified (not unqualified) 
<A NAME="429"></A>'coming-to-be', though unqualified 'passing-away' (e.g. of Fire). This 
<A NAME="430"></A>would be the case on the theory set forth in Parmenides: for he says that 
<A NAME="431"></A>the things into which change takes place are two, and he asserts that these 
<A NAME="432"></A>two, viz. what is and what is not, are Fire and Earth. Whether we postulate 
<A NAME="433"></A>these, or other things of a similar kind, makes no difference. For we are 
<A NAME="434"></A>trying to discover not what undergoes these changes, but what is their 
<A NAME="435"></A>characteristic manner. The passage, then, into what 'is' not except with 
<A NAME="436"></A>a qualification is unqualified passing-away, while the passage into what 
<A NAME="437"></A>'is' without qualification is unqualified coming-to-be. Hence whatever 
<A NAME="438"></A>the contrasted 'poles' of the changes may be whether Fire and Earth, or 
<A NAME="439"></A>some other couple-the one of them will be 'a being' and the other 'a 
<A NAME="440"></A>not-being'.
<A NAME="441"></A><BR><BR>We have thus stated one characteristic manner in which unqualified 
<A NAME="442"></A>will be distinguished from qualified coming-to-be and passing-away: but 
<A NAME="443"></A>they are also distinguished according to the special nature of the material 
<A NAME="444"></A>of the changing thing. For a material, whose constitutive differences signify 
<A NAME="445"></A>more a 'this somewhat', is itself more 'substantial' or 'real': while a 
<A NAME="446"></A>material, whose constitutive differences signify privation, is 'not real'. 
<A NAME="447"></A>(Suppose, e.g. that 'the hot' is a positive predication, i.e. a 'form', 
<A NAME="448"></A>whereas 'cold' is a privation, and that Earth and Fire differ from one 
<A NAME="449"></A>another by these constitutive differences.)
<A NAME="450"></A><BR><BR>The opinion, however, which most people are inclined to prefer, 
<A NAME="451"></A>is that the distinction depends upon the difference between 'the perceptible' 
<A NAME="452"></A>and 'the imperceptible'. Thus, when there is a change into perceptible 
<A NAME="453"></A>material, people say there is 'coming-to-be'; but when there is a change 
<A NAME="454"></A>into invisible material, they call it 'passing-away'. For they distinguish 
<A NAME="455"></A>'what is' and 'what is not' by their perceiving and not-perceiving, just 
<A NAME="456"></A>as what is knowable 'is' and what is unknowable 'is not'-perception on 
<A NAME="457"></A>their view having the force of knowledge. Hence, just as they deem themselves 
<A NAME="458"></A>to live and to 'be' in virtue of their perceiving or their capacity to 
<A NAME="459"></A>perceive, so too they deem the things to 'be' qua perceived or perceptible-and 
<A NAME="460"></A>in this they are in a sense on the track of the truth, though what they 
<A NAME="461"></A>actually say is not true.
<A NAME="462"></A><BR><BR>Thus unqualified coming-to-be and passingaway turn out to be different 
<A NAME="463"></A>according to common opinion from what they are in truth. For Wind and Air 
<A NAME="464"></A>are in truth more real more a 'this somewhat' or a 'form'-than Earth. But 
<A NAME="465"></A>they are less real to perception which explains why things are commonly 
<A NAME="466"></A>said to 'pass-away' without qualification when they change into Wind and 
<A NAME="467"></A>Air, and to 'come-to-be' when they change into what is tangible, i.e. into 
<A NAME="468"></A>Earth.
<A NAME="469"></A><BR><BR>We have now explained why there is 'unqualified coming-to-be' (though 
<A NAME="470"></A>it is a passingaway-of-something) and 'unqualified passingaway (though 
<A NAME="471"></A>it is a coming-to-be-of-something). For this distinction of appellation 
<A NAME="472"></A>depends upon a difference in the material out of which, and into which, 
<A NAME="473"></A>the changes are effected. It depends either upon whether the material is 
<A NAME="474"></A>or is not 'substantial', or upon whether it is more or less 'substantial', 
<A NAME="475"></A>or upon whether it is more or less perceptible.
<A NAME="476"></A><BR><BR>(ii) But why are some things said to 'come to-be' without qualification, 
<A NAME="477"></A>and others only to 'come-to-be-so-and-so', in cases different from the 
<A NAME="478"></A>one we have been considering where two things come-to-be reciprocally out 
<A NAME="479"></A>of one another? For at present we have explained no more than this:-why, 
<A NAME="480"></A>when two things change reciprocally into one another, we do not attribute 
<A NAME="481"></A>coming-to-be and passing-away uniformly to them both, although every coming-to-be 
<A NAME="482"></A>is a passing-away of something else and every passing-away some other thing's 
<A NAME="483"></A>coming-to-be. But the question subsequently formulated involves a different 
<A NAME="484"></A>problem-viz. why, although the learning thing is said to 'come-to-be-learned' 
<A NAME="485"></A>but not to 'come-tobe' without qualification, yet the growing thing is 
<A NAME="486"></A>said to 'come-to-be'.
<A NAME="487"></A><BR><BR>The distinction here turns upon the difference of the Categories. 
<A NAME="488"></A>For some things signify a this somewhat, others a such, and others a so-much. 
<A NAME="489"></A>Those things, then, which do not signify substance, are not said to 'come-to-be' 
<A NAME="490"></A>without qualification, but only to 'come-to-be-so-and-so'. Nevertheless, 
<A NAME="491"></A>in all changing things alike, we speak of 'coming-to-be' when the thing 
<A NAME="492"></A>comes-to-be something in one of the two Columns-e.g. in Substance, if it 
<A NAME="493"></A>comes-to-be Fire but not if it comes-to-be Earth; and in Quality, if it 
<A NAME="494"></A>comes-to-be learned but not when it comes-to-be ignorant.
<A NAME="495"></A><BR><BR>We have explained why some things come to-be without qualification, 
<A NAME="496"></A>but not others both in general, and also when the changing things are substances 
<A NAME="497"></A>and nothing else; and we have stated that the substratum is the material 
<A NAME="498"></A>cause of the continuous occurrence of coming to-be, because it is such 
<A NAME="499"></A>as to change from contrary to contrary and because, in substances, the 
<A NAME="500"></A>coming-to-be of one thing is always a passing-away of another, and the 
<A NAME="501"></A>passing-away of one thing is always another's coming-to-be. But there is 
<A NAME="502"></A>no need even to discuss the other question we raised-viz. why coming-to-be 
<A NAME="503"></A>continues though things are constantly being destroyed. For just as people 
<A NAME="504"></A>speak of 'a passing-away' without qualification when a thing has passed 
<A NAME="505"></A>into what is imperceptible and what in that sense 'is not', so also they 
<A NAME="506"></A>speak of 'a coming-to-be out of a not-being' when a thing emerges from 
<A NAME="507"></A>an imperceptible. Whether, therefore, the substratum is or is not something, 
<A NAME="508"></A>what comes-tobe emerges out of a 'not-being': so that a thing comes-to-be 
<A NAME="509"></A>out of a not-being' just as much as it 'passes-away into what is not'. 
<A NAME="510"></A>Hence it is reasonable enough that coming-to-be should never fail. For 
<A NAME="511"></A>coming-to-be is a passing-away of 'what is not' and passing-away is a coming 
<A NAME="512"></A>to-be of 'what is not'.
<A NAME="513"></A><BR><BR>But what about that which 'is' not except with a qualification? 
<A NAME="514"></A>Is it one of the two contrary poles of the chang-e.g. Earth (i.e. the heavy) 
<A NAME="515"></A>a 'not-being', but Fire (i.e. the light) a 'being'? Or, on the contrary, 
<A NAME="516"></A>does what is 'include Earth as well as Fire, whereas what is not' is matter-the 
<A NAME="517"></A>matter of Earth and Fire alike? And again, is the matter of each different? 
<A NAME="518"></A>Or is it the same, since otherwise they would not come-to-be reciprocally 
<A NAME="519"></A>out of one another, i.e. contraries out of contraries? For these things-Fire, 
<A NAME="520"></A>Earth, Water, Air-are characterized by 'the contraries'.
<A NAME="521"></A><BR><BR>Perhaps the solution is that their matter is in one sense the same, 
<A NAME="522"></A>but in another sense different. For that which underlies them, whatever 
<A NAME="523"></A>its nature may be qua underlying them, is the same: but its actual being 
<A NAME="524"></A>is not the same. So much, then, on these topics.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="525"></A><B>Part 4</B>

<A NAME="526"></A><BR><BR>Next we must state what the difference is between coming-to-be 
<A NAME="527"></A>and 'alteration'-for we maintain that these changes are distinct from one 
<A NAME="528"></A>another.
<A NAME="529"></A><BR><BR>Since, then, we must distinguish (a) the substratum, and (b) the 
<A NAME="530"></A>property whose nature it is to be predicated of the substratum; and since 
<A NAME="531"></A>change of each of these occurs; there is 'alteration' when the substratum 
<A NAME="532"></A>is perceptible and persists, but changes in its own properties, the properties 
<A NAME="533"></A>in question being opposed to one another either as contraries or as intermediates. 
<A NAME="534"></A>The body, e.g. although persisting as the same body, is now healthy and 
<A NAME="535"></A>now ill; and the bronze is now spherical and at another time angular, and 
<A NAME="536"></A>yet remains the same bronze. But when nothing perceptible persists in its 
<A NAME="537"></A>identity as a substratum, and the thing changes as a whole (when e.g. the 
<A NAME="538"></A>seed as a whole is converted into blood, or water into air, or air as a 
<A NAME="539"></A>whole into water), such an occurrence is no longer 'alteration'. It is 
<A NAME="540"></A>a coming-to-be of one substance and a passing-away of the other-especially 
<A NAME="541"></A>if the change proceeds from an imperceptible something to something perceptible 
<A NAME="542"></A>(either to touch or to all the senses), as when water comes-to-be out of, 
<A NAME="543"></A>or passes-away into, air: for air is pretty well imperceptible. If, however, 
<A NAME="544"></A>in such cases, any property (being one of a pair of contraries) persists, 
<A NAME="545"></A>in the thing that has come-to-be, the same as it was in the thing which 
<A NAME="546"></A>has passedaway-if, e.g. when water comes-to-be out of air, both are transparent 
<A NAME="547"></A>or cold-the second thing, into which the first changes, must not be a property 
<A NAME="548"></A>of this persistent identical something. Otherwise the change will be 'alteration.' 
<A NAME="549"></A>Suppose, e.g. that the musical man passed-away and an unmusical man came-tobe, 
<A NAME="550"></A>and that the man persists as something identical. Now, if 'musicalness 
<A NAME="551"></A>and unmusicalness' had not been a property essentially inhering in man, 
<A NAME="552"></A>these changes would have been a coming-to-be of unmusicalness and a passing-away 
<A NAME="553"></A>of musicalness: but in fact 'musicalness and unmusicalness' are a property 
<A NAME="554"></A>of the persistent identity, viz. man. (Hence, as regards man, these changes 
<A NAME="555"></A>are 'modifications'; though, as regards musical man and unmusical man, 
<A NAME="556"></A>they are a passing-away and a coming-to-be.) Consequently such changes 
<A NAME="557"></A>are 'alteration.' When the change from contrary to contrary is in quantity, 
<A NAME="558"></A>it is 'growth and diminution'; when it is in place, it is 'motion'; when 
<A NAME="559"></A>it is in property, i.e. in quality, it is 'alteration': but, when nothing 
<A NAME="560"></A>persists, of which the resultant is a property (or an 'accident' in any 
<A NAME="561"></A>sense of the term), it is 'coming-to-be', and the converse change is 
<A NAME="562"></A>'passing-away'.
<A NAME="563"></A><BR><BR>'Matter', in the most proper sense of the term, is to be identified 
<A NAME="564"></A>with the substratum which is receptive of coming-to-be and passingaway: 
<A NAME="565"></A>but the substratum of the remaining kinds of change is also, in a certain 
<A NAME="566"></A>sense, 'matter', because all these substrata are receptive of 'contrarieties' 
<A NAME="567"></A>of some kind. So much, then, as an answer to the questions (i) whether 
<A NAME="568"></A>coming-to-be 'is' or 'is not'-i.e. what are the precise conditions of its 
<A NAME="569"></A>occurrence and (ii) what 'alteration' is: but we have still to treat of 
<A NAME="570"></A>growth.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="571"></A><B>Part 5</B>

<A NAME="572"></A><BR><BR>We must explain (i) wherein growth differs from coming-to-be and 
<A NAME="573"></A>from 'alteration', and ii) what is the process of growing and the sprocess 
<A NAME="574"></A>of diminishing in each and all of the things that grow and 
<A NAME="575"></A>diminish.
<A NAME="576"></A><BR><BR>Hence our first question is this: Do these changes differ from 
<A NAME="577"></A>one another solely because of a difference in their respective 'spheres'? 
<A NAME="578"></A>In other words, do they differ because, while a change from this to that 
<A NAME="579"></A>(viz. from potential to actual substance) is coming-to-be, a change in 
<A NAME="580"></A>the sphere of magnitude is growth and one in the sphere of quality is 'alteration'-both 
<A NAME="581"></A>growth and 'alteration' being changes from what is-potentially to what 
<A NAME="582"></A>is-actually magnitude and quality respectively? Or is there also a difference 
<A NAME="583"></A>in the manner of the change, since it is evident that, whereas neither 
<A NAME="584"></A>what is 'altering' nor what is coming-to-be necessarily changes its place, 
<A NAME="585"></A>what is growing or diminishing changes its spatial position of necessity, 
<A NAME="586"></A>though in a different manner from that in which the moving thing does so? 
<A NAME="587"></A>For that which is being moved changes its place as a whole: but the growing 
<A NAME="588"></A>thing changes its place like a metal that is being beaten, retaining its 
<A NAME="589"></A>position as a whole while its parts change their places. They change their 
<A NAME="590"></A>places, but not in the same way as the parts of a revolving globe. For 
<A NAME="591"></A>the parts of the globe change their places while the whole continues to 
<A NAME="592"></A>occupy an equal place: but the parts of the rowing thing expand over an 
<A NAME="593"></A>ever-increasing place and the parts of the diminishing thing contract within 
<A NAME="594"></A>an ever-diminishing area.
<A NAME="595"></A><BR><BR>It is clear, then, that these changes-the changes of that which 
<A NAME="596"></A>is coming-to-be, of that which is 'altering', and of that which is growing-differ 
<A NAME="597"></A>in manner as well as in sphere. But how are we to conceive the 'sphere' 
<A NAME="598"></A>of the change which is growth and diminution? The sphere' of growing and 
<A NAME="599"></A>diminishing is believed to be magnitude. Are we to suppose that body and 
<A NAME="600"></A>magnitude come-to-be out of something which, though potentially magnitude 
<A NAME="601"></A>and body, is actually incorporeal and devoid of magnitude? And since this 
<A NAME="602"></A>description may be understood in two different ways, in which of these 
<A NAME="603"></A>two ways are we to apply it to the process of growth? Is the matter, out 
<A NAME="604"></A>of which growth takes place, (i) 'separate' and existing alone by itself, 
<A NAME="605"></A>or (ii) 'separate' but contained in another body?
<A NAME="606"></A><BR><BR>Perhaps it is impossible for growth to take place in either of 
<A NAME="607"></A>these ways. For since the matter is 'separate', either (a) it will occupy 
<A NAME="608"></A>no place (as if it were a point), or (b) it will be a 'void', i.e. a non-perceptible 
<A NAME="609"></A>body. But the first of these alternatives is impossible. For since what 
<A NAME="610"></A>comes-to-be out of this incorporeal and sizeless something will always 
<A NAME="611"></A>be 'somewhere', it too must be 'somewhere'-either intrinsically or indirectly. 
<A NAME="612"></A>And the second alternative necessarily implies that the matter is contained 
<A NAME="613"></A>in some other body. But if it is to be 'in' another body and yet remains 
<A NAME="614"></A>'separate' in such a way that it is in no sense a part of that body (neither 
<A NAME="615"></A>a part of its substantial being nor an 'accident' of it), many impossibilities 
<A NAME="616"></A>will result. It is as if we were to suppose that when, e.g. air comes-to-be 
<A NAME="617"></A>out of water the process were due not to a change of the but to the matter 
<A NAME="618"></A>of the air being 'contained in' the water as in a vessel. This is impossible. 
<A NAME="619"></A>For (i) there is nothing to prevent an indeterminate number of matters 
<A NAME="620"></A>being thus 'contained in' the water, so that they might come-to-be actually 
<A NAME="621"></A>an indeterminate quantity of air; and (ii) we do not in fact see air coming-to-be 
<A NAME="622"></A>out of water in this fashion, viz. withdrawing out of it and leaving it 
<A NAME="623"></A>unchanged.
<A NAME="624"></A><BR><BR>It is therefore better to suppose that in all instances of coming-to-be 
<A NAME="625"></A>the matter is inseparable, being numerically identical and one with the 
<A NAME="626"></A>'containing' body, though isolable from it by definition. But the same 
<A NAME="627"></A>reasons also forbid us to regard the matter, out of which the body comes-to-be, 
<A NAME="628"></A>as points or lines. The matter is that of which points and lines are limits, 
<A NAME="629"></A>and it is something that can never exist without quality and without 
<A NAME="630"></A>form.
<A NAME="631"></A><BR><BR>Now it is no doubt true, as we have also established elsewhere,' 
<A NAME="632"></A>that one thing 'comes-tobe' (in the unqualified sense) out of another thing: 
<A NAME="633"></A>and further it is true that the efficient cause of its coming-to-be is 
<A NAME="634"></A>either (i) an actual thing (which is the same as the effect either generically-or 
<A NAME="635"></A>the efficient cause of the coming-to-be of a hard thing is not a hard thing 
<A NAME="636"></A>or specifically, as e.g. fire is the efficient cause of the coming-to-be 
<A NAME="637"></A>of fire or one man of the birth of another), or (ii) an actuality. Nevertheless, 
<A NAME="638"></A>since there is also a matter out of which corporeal substance itself comes-to-be 
<A NAME="639"></A>(corporeal substance, however, already characterized as such-and-such a 
<A NAME="640"></A>determinate body, for there is no such thing as body in general), this 
<A NAME="641"></A>same matter is also the matter of magnitude and quality-being separable 
<A NAME="642"></A>from these matters by definition, but not separable in place unless Qualities 
<A NAME="643"></A>are, in their turn, separable.
<A NAME="644"></A><BR><BR>It is evident, from the preceding development and discussion of 
<A NAME="645"></A>difficulties, that growth is not a change out of something which, though 
<A NAME="646"></A>potentially a magnitude, actually possesses no magnitude. For, if it were, 
<A NAME="647"></A>the 'void' would exist in separation; but we have explained in a former 
<A NAME="648"></A>work' that this is impossible. Moreover, a change of that kind is not peculiarly 
<A NAME="649"></A>distinctive of growth, but characterizes coming-to-be as such or in general. 
<A NAME="650"></A>For growth is an increase, and diminution is a lessening, of the magnitude 
<A NAME="651"></A>which is there already-that, indeed, is why the growing thing must possess 
<A NAME="652"></A>some magnitude. Hence growth must not be regarded as a process from a matter 
<A NAME="653"></A>without magnitude to an actuality of magnitude: for this would be a body's 
<A NAME="654"></A>coming-to-be rather than its growth.
<A NAME="655"></A><BR><BR>We must therefore come to closer quarters with the subject of our 
<A NAME="656"></A>inquiry. We must grapple' with it (as it were) from its beginning, and 
<A NAME="657"></A>determine the precise character of the growing and diminishing whose causes 
<A NAME="658"></A>we are investigating.
<A NAME="659"></A><BR><BR>It is evident (i) that any and every part of the growing thing 
<A NAME="660"></A>has increased, and that similarly in diminution every part has become smaller: 
<A NAME="661"></A>also (ii) that a thing grows by the accession, and diminishes by the departure, 
<A NAME="662"></A>of something. Hence it must grow by the accession either (a) of something 
<A NAME="663"></A>incorporeal or (b) of a body. Now, if (a) it grows by the accession of 
<A NAME="664"></A>something incorporeal, there will exist separate a void: but (as we have 
<A NAME="665"></A>stated before)' is impossible for a matter of magnitude to exist 'separate'. 
<A NAME="666"></A>If, on the other hand (b) it grows by the accession of a body, there will 
<A NAME="667"></A>be two bodies-that which grows and that which increases it-in the same 
<A NAME="668"></A>place: and this too is impossible.
<A NAME="669"></A><BR><BR>But neither is it open to us to say that growth or diminution occurs 
<A NAME="670"></A>in the way in which e.g. air is generated from water. For, although the 
<A NAME="671"></A>volume has then become greater, the change will not be growth, but a coming 
<A NAME="672"></A>to-be of the one-viz. of that into which the change is taking place-and 
<A NAME="673"></A>a passing-away of the contrasted body. It is not a growth of either. Nothing 
<A NAME="674"></A>grows in the process; unless indeed there be something common to both things 
<A NAME="675"></A>(to that which is coming-to-be and to that which passed-away), e.g. 'body', 
<A NAME="676"></A>and this grows. The water has not grown, nor has the air: but the former 
<A NAME="677"></A>has passed-away and the latter has come-to-be, and-if anything has grown-there 
<A NAME="678"></A>has been a growth of 'body.' Yet this too is impossible. For our account 
<A NAME="679"></A>of growth must preserve the characteristics of that which is growing and 
<A NAME="680"></A>diminishing. And these characteristics are three: (i) any and every part 
<A NAME="681"></A>of the growing magnitude is made bigger (e.g. if flesh grows, every particle 
<A NAME="682"></A>of the flesh gets bigger), (ii) by the accession of something, and (iii) 
<A NAME="683"></A>in such a way that the growing thing is preserved and persists. For whereas 
<A NAME="684"></A>a thing does not persist in the processes of unqualified coming-to-be or 
<A NAME="685"></A>passing-away, that which grows or 'alters' persists in its identity through 
<A NAME="686"></A>the 'altering' and through the growing or diminishing, though the quality 
<A NAME="687"></A>(in 'alteration') and the size (in growth) do not remain the same. Now 
<A NAME="688"></A>if the generation of air from water is to be regarded as growth, a thing 
<A NAME="689"></A>might grow without the accession (and without the persistence) of anything, 
<A NAME="690"></A>and diminish without the departure of anything-and that which grows need 
<A NAME="691"></A>not persist. But this characteristic must be preserved: for the growth 
<A NAME="692"></A>we are discussing has been assumed to be thus characterized.
<A NAME="693"></A><BR><BR>One might raise a further difficulty. What is 'that which grows'? 
<A NAME="694"></A>Is it that to which something is added? If, e.g. a man grows in his shin, 
<A NAME="695"></A>is it the shin which is greater-but not that 'whereby' he grows, viz. not 
<A NAME="696"></A>the food? Then why have not both 'grown'? For when A is added to B, both 
<A NAME="697"></A>A and B are greater, as when you mix wine with water; for each ingredient 
<A NAME="698"></A>is alike increased in volume. Perhaps the explanation is that the substance 
<A NAME="699"></A>of the one remains unchanged, but the substance of the other (viz. of the 
<A NAME="700"></A>food) does not. For indeed, even in the mixture of wine and water, it is 
<A NAME="701"></A>the prevailing ingredient which is said to have increased in volume. We 
<A NAME="702"></A>say, e.g. that the wine has increased, because the whole mixture acts as 
<A NAME="703"></A>wine but not as water. A similar principle applies also to 'alteration'. 
<A NAME="704"></A>Flesh is said to have been 'altered' if, while its character and substance 
<A NAME="705"></A>remain, some one of its essential properties, which was not there before, 
<A NAME="706"></A>now qualifies it: on the other hand, that 'whereby' it has been 'altered' 
<A NAME="707"></A>may have undergone no change, though sometimes it too has been affected. 
<A NAME="708"></A>The altering agent, however, and the originative source of the process 
<A NAME="709"></A>are in the growing thing and in that which is being 'altered': for the 
<A NAME="710"></A>efficient cause is in these. No doubt the food, which has come in, may 
<A NAME="711"></A>sometimes expand as well as the body that has consumed it (that is so, 
<A NAME="712"></A>e.g. if, after having come in, a food is converted into wind), but when 
<A NAME="713"></A>it has undergone this change it has passedaway: and the efficient cause 
<A NAME="714"></A>is not in the food.
<A NAME="715"></A><BR><BR>We have now developed the difficulties sufficiently and must therefore 
<A NAME="716"></A>try to find a solution of the problem. Our solution must preserve intact 
<A NAME="717"></A>the three characteristics of growth-that the growing thing persists, that 
<A NAME="718"></A>it grows by the accession (and diminishes by the departure) of something, 
<A NAME="719"></A>and further that every perceptible particle of it has become either larger 
<A NAME="720"></A>or smaller. We must recognize also (a) that the growing body is not 'void' 
<A NAME="721"></A>and that yet there are not two magnitudes in the same place, and (b) that 
<A NAME="722"></A>it does not grow by the accession of something incorporeal.
<A NAME="723"></A><BR><BR>Two preliminary distinctions will prepare us to grasp the cause 
<A NAME="724"></A>of growth. We must note (i) that the organic parts grow by the growth of 
<A NAME="725"></A>the tissues (for every organ is composed of these as its constituents); 
<A NAME="726"></A>and (ii) that flesh, bone, and every such part-like every other thing which 
<A NAME="727"></A>has its form immersed in matter-has a twofold nature: for the form as well 
<A NAME="728"></A>as the matter is called 'flesh' or 'bone'.
<A NAME="729"></A><BR><BR>Now, that any and every part of the tissue qua form should grow-and 
<A NAME="730"></A>grow by the accession of something-is possible, but not that any and every 
<A NAME="731"></A>part of the tissue qua matter should do so. For we must think of the tissue 
<A NAME="732"></A>after the image of flowing water that is measured by one and the same measure: 
<A NAME="733"></A>particle after particle comes-to-be, and each successive particle is different. 
<A NAME="734"></A>And it is in this sense that the matter of the flesh grows, some flowing 
<A NAME="735"></A>out and some flowing in fresh; not in the sense that fresh matter accedes 
<A NAME="736"></A>to every particle of it. There is, however, an accession to every part 
<A NAME="737"></A>of its figure or 'form'.
<A NAME="738"></A><BR><BR>That growth has taken place proportionally, is more manifest in 
<A NAME="739"></A>the organic parts-e.g. in the hand. For there the fact that the matter 
<A NAME="740"></A>is distinct from the form is more manifest than in flesh, i.e. than in 
<A NAME="741"></A>the tissues. That is why there is a greater tendency to suppose that a 
<A NAME="742"></A>corpse still possesses flesh and bone than that it still has a hand or 
<A NAME="743"></A>an arm.
<A NAME="744"></A><BR><BR>Hence in one sense it is true that any and every part of the flesh 
<A NAME="745"></A>has grown; but in another sense it is false. For there has been an accession 
<A NAME="746"></A>to every part of the flesh in respect to its form, but not in respect to 
<A NAME="747"></A>its matter. The whole, however, has become larger. And this increase is 
<A NAME="748"></A>due (a) on the one hand to the accession of something, which is called 
<A NAME="749"></A>'food' and is said to be 'contrary' to flesh, but (b) on the other hand 
<A NAME="750"></A>to the transformation of this food into the same form as that of flesh 
<A NAME="751"></A>as if, e.g. 'moist' were to accede to 'dry' and, having acceded, were to 
<A NAME="752"></A>be transformed and to become 'dry'. For in one sense 'Like grows by Like', 
<A NAME="753"></A>but in another sense 'Unlike grows by Unlike'.
<A NAME="754"></A><BR><BR>One might discuss what must be the character of that 'whereby' 
<A NAME="755"></A>a thing grows. Clearly it must be potentially that which is growing-potentially 
<A NAME="756"></A>flesh, e.g. if it is flesh that is growing. Actually, therefore, it must 
<A NAME="757"></A>be 'other' than the growing thing. This 'actual other', then, has passed-away 
<A NAME="758"></A>and come-to-be flesh. But it has not been transformed into flesh alone 
<A NAME="759"></A>by itself (for that would have been a coming-to-be, not a growth): on the 
<A NAME="760"></A>contrary, it is the growing thing which has come-to-be flesh (and grown) 
<A NAME="761"></A>by the food. In what way, then, has the food been modified by the growing 
<A NAME="762"></A>thing? Perhaps we should say that it has been 'mixed' with it, as if one 
<A NAME="763"></A>were to pour water into wine and the wine were able to convert the new 
<A NAME="764"></A>ingredient into wine. And as fire lays hold of the inflammable, so the 
<A NAME="765"></A>active principle of growth, dwelling in the growing thing that which is 
<A NAME="766"></A>actually flesh), lays hold of an acceding food which is potentially flesh 
<A NAME="767"></A>and converts it into actual flesh. The acceding food, therefore, must be 
<A NAME="768"></A>together with the growing thing: for if it were apart from it, the change 
<A NAME="769"></A>would be a coming-to-be. For it is possible to produce fire by piling logs 
<A NAME="770"></A>on to the already burning fire. That is 'growth'. But when the logs themselves 
<A NAME="771"></A>are set on fire, that is 'coming-to-be'.
<A NAME="772"></A><BR><BR>'Quantum-in-general' does not come-to-be any more than 'animal' 
<A NAME="773"></A>which is neither man nor any other of the specific forms of animal: what 
<A NAME="774"></A>'animal-in-general' is in coming-to-be, that 'quantum-in-general' is in 
<A NAME="775"></A>growth. But what does come-to-be in growth is flesh or bone-or a hand or 
<A NAME="776"></A>arm (i.e. the tissues of these organic parts). Such things come-to-be, 
<A NAME="777"></A>then, by the accession not of quantified-flesh but of a quantified-something. 
<A NAME="778"></A>In so far as this acceding food is potentially the double result e.g. is 
<A NAME="779"></A>potentially so-much-flesh-it produces growth: for it is bound to become 
<A NAME="780"></A>actually both so-much and flesh. But in so far as it is potentially flesh 
<A NAME="781"></A>only, it nourishes: for it is thus that 'nutrition' and 'growth' differ 
<A NAME="782"></A>by their definition. That is why a body's' nutrition' continues so long 
<A NAME="783"></A>as it is kept alive (even when it is diminishing), though not its 'growth'; 
<A NAME="784"></A>and why nutrition, though 'the same' as growth, is yet different from it 
<A NAME="785"></A>in its actual being. For in so far as that which accedes is potentially 
<A NAME="786"></A>'so much-flesh' it tends to increase flesh: whereas, in so far as it is 
<A NAME="787"></A>potentially 'flesh' only, it is nourishment.
<A NAME="788"></A><BR><BR>The form of which we have spoken is a kind of power immersed in 
<A NAME="789"></A>matter-a duct, as it were. If, then, a matter accedes-a matter, which is 
<A NAME="790"></A>potentially a duct and also potentially possesses determinate quantity 
<A NAME="791"></A>the ducts to which it accedes will become bigger. But if it is no longer 
<A NAME="792"></A>able to act-if it has been weakened by the continued influx of matter, 
<A NAME="793"></A>just as water, continually mixed in greater and greater quantity with wine, 
<A NAME="794"></A>in the end makes the wine watery and converts it into water-then it will 
<A NAME="795"></A>cause a diminution of the quantum; though still the form 
<A NAME="796"></A>persists.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="797"></A><B>Part 6</B>

<A NAME="798"></A><BR><BR>(In discussing the causes of coming-tobe) we must first investigate 
<A NAME="799"></A>the matter, i.e. the so-called 'elements'. We must ask whether they really 
<A NAME="800"></A>are clements or not, i.e. whether each of them is eternal or whether there 
<A NAME="801"></A>is a sense in which they come-to-be: and, if they do come-to-be, whether 
<A NAME="802"></A>all of them come-to-be in the same manner reciprocally out of one another, 
<A NAME="803"></A>or whether one amongst them is something primary. Hence we must begin by 
<A NAME="804"></A>explaining certain preliminary matters, about which the statements now 
<A NAME="805"></A>current are vague.
<A NAME="806"></A><BR><BR>For all (the pluralist philosophers)- those who generate the 'elements' 
<A NAME="807"></A>as well as those who generate the bodies that are compounded of the elements- 
<A NAME="808"></A>make use of 'dissociation' and 'association', and of 'action' and 'passion'. 
<A NAME="809"></A>Now 'association' is 'combination'; but the precise meaning of the process 
<A NAME="810"></A>we call 'combining' has not been explained. Again, (all the monists make 
<A NAME="811"></A>use of 'alteration': but) without an agent and a patient there cannot be 
<A NAME="812"></A>'altering' any more than there can be 'dissociating' and 'associating'. 
<A NAME="813"></A>For not only those who postulate a plurality of elements employ their reciprocal 
<A NAME="814"></A>action and passion to generate the compounds: those who derive things from 
<A NAME="815"></A>a single element are equally compelled to introduce 'acting'. And in this 
<A NAME="816"></A>respect Diogenes is right when he argues that 'unless all things were derived 
<A NAME="817"></A>from one, reciprocal action and passion could not have occurred'. The hot 
<A NAME="818"></A>thing, e.g. would not be cooled and the cold thing in turn be warmed: for 
<A NAME="819"></A>heat and cold do not change reciprocally into one another, but what changes 
<A NAME="820"></A>(it is clear) is the substratum. Hence, whenever there is action and passion 
<A NAME="821"></A>between two things, that which underlies them must be a single something. 
<A NAME="822"></A>No doubt, it is not true to say that all things are of this character: 
<A NAME="823"></A>but it is true of all things between which there is reciprocal action and 
<A NAME="824"></A>passion.
<A NAME="825"></A><BR><BR>But if we must investigate 'action-passion' and 'combination', 
<A NAME="826"></A>we must also investigate 'contact'. For action and passion (in the proper 
<A NAME="827"></A>sense of the terms) can only occur between things which are such as to 
<A NAME="828"></A>touch one another; nor can things enter into combination at all unless 
<A NAME="829"></A>they have come into a certain kind of contact. Hence we must give a definite 
<A NAME="830"></A>account of these three things- of 'contact', 'combination', and 
<A NAME="831"></A>'acting'.
<A NAME="832"></A><BR><BR>Let us start as follows. All things which admit of 'combination' 
<A NAME="833"></A>must be capable of reciprocal contact: and the same is true of any two 
<A NAME="834"></A>things, of which one 'acts' and the other 'suffers action' in the proper 
<A NAME="835"></A>sense of the terms. For this reason we must treat of 'contact' first. every 
<A NAME="836"></A>term which possesses a variety of meaning includes those various meanings 
<A NAME="837"></A>either owing to a mere coincidence of language, or owing to a real order 
<A NAME="838"></A>of derivation in the different things to which it is applied: but, though 
<A NAME="839"></A>this may be taken to hold of 'contact' as of all such terms, it is nevertheless 
<A NAME="840"></A>true that contact' in the proper sense applies only to things which have 
<A NAME="841"></A>'position'. And 'position' belongs only to those things which also have 
<A NAME="842"></A>a Place': for in so far as we attribute 'contact' to the mathematical things, 
<A NAME="843"></A>we must also attribute 'place' to them, whether they exist in separation 
<A NAME="844"></A>or in some other fashion. Assuming, therefore, that 'to touch' is-as we 
<A NAME="845"></A>have defined it in a previous work'-'to have the extremes together', only 
<A NAME="846"></A>those things will touch one another which, being separate magnitudes and 
<A NAME="847"></A>possessing position, have their extremes 'together'. And since position 
<A NAME="848"></A>belongs only to those things which also have a 'place', while the primary 
<A NAME="849"></A>differentiation of 'place' is the above' and 'the below' (and the similar 
<A NAME="850"></A>pairs of opposites), all things which touch one another will have 'weight' 
<A NAME="851"></A>or 'lightness' either both these qualities or one or the other of them. 
<A NAME="852"></A>But bodies which are heavy or light are such as to 'act' and 'suffer action'. 
<A NAME="853"></A>Hence it is clear that those things are by nature such as to touch one 
<A NAME="854"></A>another, which (being separate magnitudes) have their extremes 'together' 
<A NAME="855"></A>and are able to move, and be moved by, one another.
<A NAME="856"></A><BR><BR>The manner in which the 'mover' moves the moved' not always the 
<A NAME="857"></A>same: on the contrary, whereas one kind of 'mover' can only impart motion 
<A NAME="858"></A>by being itself moved, another kind can do so though remaining itself unmoved. 
<A NAME="859"></A>Clearly therefore we must recognize a corresponding variety in speaking 
<A NAME="860"></A>of the 'acting' thing too: for the 'mover' is said to 'act' (in a sense) 
<A NAME="861"></A>and the 'acting' thing to 'impart motion'. Nevertheless there is a difference 
<A NAME="862"></A>and we must draw a distinction. For not every 'mover' can 'act', if (a) 
<A NAME="863"></A>the term 'agent' is to be used in contrast to 'patient' and (b) 'patient' 
<A NAME="864"></A>is to be applied only to those things whose motion is a 'qualitative affection'-i.e. 
<A NAME="865"></A>a quality, like white' or 'hot', in respect to which they are moved' only 
<A NAME="866"></A>in the sense that they are 'altered': on the contrary, to 'impart motion' 
<A NAME="867"></A>is a wider term than to 'act'. Still, so much, at any rate, is clear: the 
<A NAME="868"></A>things which are 'such as to impart motion', if that description be interpreted 
<A NAME="869"></A>in one sense, will touch the things which are 'such as to be moved by them'-while 
<A NAME="870"></A>they will not touch them, if the description be interpreted in a different 
<A NAME="871"></A>sense. But the disjunctive definition of 'touching' must include and distinguish 
<A NAME="872"></A>(a) 'contact in general' as the relation between two things which, having 
<A NAME="873"></A>position, are such that one is able to impart motion and the other to be 
<A NAME="874"></A>moved, and (b) 'reciprocal contact' as the relation between two things, 
<A NAME="875"></A>one able to impart motion and the other able to be moved in such a way 
<A NAME="876"></A>that 'action and passion' are predicable of them.
<A NAME="877"></A><BR><BR>As a rule, no doubt, if A touches B, B touches A. For indeed practically 
<A NAME="878"></A>all the 'movers' within our ordinary experience impart motion by being 
<A NAME="879"></A>moved: in their case, what touches inevitably must, and also evidently 
<A NAME="880"></A>does, touch something which reciprocally touches it. Yet, if A moves B, 
<A NAME="881"></A>it is possible-as we sometimes express it-for A 'merely to touch' B, and 
<A NAME="882"></A>that which touches need not touch a something which touches it. Nevertheless 
<A NAME="883"></A>it is commonly supposed that 'touching' must be reciprocal. The reason 
<A NAME="884"></A>of this belief is that 'movers' which belong to the same kind as the 'moved' 
<A NAME="885"></A>impart motion by being moved. Hence if anything imparts motion without 
<A NAME="886"></A>itself being moved, it may touch the 'moved' and yet itself be touched 
<A NAME="887"></A>by nothing-for we say sometimes that the man who grieves us 'touches' us, 
<A NAME="888"></A>but not that we 'touch' him.
<A NAME="889"></A><BR><BR>The account just given may serve to distinguish and define the 
<A NAME="890"></A>'contact' which occurs in the things of Nature.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="891"></A><B>Part 7</B>

<A NAME="892"></A><BR><BR>Next in order we must discuss 'action' and 'passion'. The traditional 
<A NAME="893"></A>theories on the subject are conflicting. For (i) most thinkers are unanimous 
<A NAME="894"></A>in maintaining (a) that 'like' is always unaffected by 'like', because 
<A NAME="895"></A>(as they argue) neither of two 'likes' is more apt than the other either 
<A NAME="896"></A>to act or to suffer action, since all the properties which belong to the 
<A NAME="897"></A>one belong identically and in the same degree to the other; and (b) that 
<A NAME="898"></A>'unlikes', i.e. 'differents', are by nature such as to act and suffer action 
<A NAME="899"></A>reciprocally. For even when the smaller fire is destroyed by the greater, 
<A NAME="900"></A>it suffers this effect (they say) owing to its 'contrariety' since the 
<A NAME="901"></A>great is contrary to the small. But (ii) Democritus dissented from all 
<A NAME="902"></A>the other thinkers and maintained a theory peculiar to himself. He asserts 
<A NAME="903"></A>that agent and patient are identical, i.e. 'like'. It is not possible (he 
<A NAME="904"></A>says) that 'others', i.e. 'differents', should suffer action from one another: 
<A NAME="905"></A>on the contrary, even if two things, being 'others', do act in some way 
<A NAME="906"></A>on one another, this happens to them not qua 'others' but qua possessing 
<A NAME="907"></A>an identical property.
<A NAME="908"></A><BR><BR>Such, then, are the traditional theories, and it looks as if the 
<A NAME="909"></A>statements of their advocates were in manifest conflict. But the reason 
<A NAME="910"></A>of this conflict is that each group is in fact stating a part, whereas 
<A NAME="911"></A>they ought to have taken a comprehensive view of the subject as a whole. 
<A NAME="912"></A>For (i) if A and B are 'like'-absolutely and in all respects without difference 
<A NAME="913"></A>from one another -it is reasonable to infer that neither is in any way 
<A NAME="914"></A>affected by the other. Why, indeed, should either of them tend to act any 
<A NAME="915"></A>more than the other? Moreover, if 'like' can be affected by 'like', a thing 
<A NAME="916"></A>can also be affected by itself: and yet if that were so-if 'like' tended 
<A NAME="917"></A>in fact to act qua 'like'-there would be nothing indestructible or immovable, 
<A NAME="918"></A>for everything would move itself. And (ii) the same consequence follows 
<A NAME="919"></A>if A and B are absolutely 'other', i.e. in no respect identical. Whiteness 
<A NAME="920"></A>could not be affected in any way by line nor line by whiseness-except perhaps 
<A NAME="921"></A>'coincidentally', viz. if the line happened to be white or black: for unless 
<A NAME="922"></A>two things either are, or are composed of, 'contraries', neither drives 
<A NAME="923"></A>the other out of its natural condition. But (iii) since only those things 
<A NAME="924"></A>which either involve a 'contrariety' or are 'contraries'-and not any things 
<A NAME="925"></A>selected at random-are such as to suffer action and to act, agent and patient 
<A NAME="926"></A>must be 'like' (i.e. identical) in kind and yet 'unlike' (i.e. contrary) 
<A NAME="927"></A>in species. (For it is a law of nature that body is affected by body, flavour 
<A NAME="928"></A>by flavour, colour by colour, and so in general what belongs to any kind 
<A NAME="929"></A>by a member of the same kind-the reason being that 'contraries' are in 
<A NAME="930"></A>every case within a single identical kind, and it is 'contraries' which 
<A NAME="931"></A>reciprocally act and suffer action.) Hence agent and patient must be in 
<A NAME="932"></A>one sense identical, but in another sense other than (i.e. 'unlike') one 
<A NAME="933"></A>another. And since (a) patient and agent are generically identical (i.e. 
<A NAME="934"></A>'like') but specifically 'unlike', while (b) it is 'contraries' that exhibit 
<A NAME="935"></A>this character: it is clear that 'contraries' and their 'intermediates' 
<A NAME="936"></A>are such as to suffer action and to act reciprocally-for indeed it is these 
<A NAME="937"></A>that constitute the entire sphere of passing-away and 
<A NAME="938"></A>coming-to-be.
<A NAME="939"></A><BR><BR>We can now understand why fire heats and the cold thing cools, 
<A NAME="940"></A>and in general why the active thing assimilates to itself the patient. 
<A NAME="941"></A>For agent and patient are contrary to one another, and coming-to-be is 
<A NAME="942"></A>a process into the contrary: hence the patient must change into the agent, 
<A NAME="943"></A>since it is only thus that coming-to be will be a process into the contrary. 
<A NAME="944"></A>And, again, it is intelligible that the advocates of both views, although 
<A NAME="945"></A>their theories are not the same, are yet in contact with the nature of 
<A NAME="946"></A>the facts. For sometimes we speak of the substratum as suffering action 
<A NAME="947"></A>(e.g. of 'the man' as being healed, being warmed and chilled, and similarly 
<A NAME="948"></A>in all the other cases), but at other times we say 'what is cold is 'being 
<A NAME="949"></A>warmed', 'what is sick is being healed': and in both these ways of speaking 
<A NAME="950"></A>we express the truth, since in one sense it is the 'matter', while in another 
<A NAME="951"></A>sense it is the 'contrary', which suffers action. (We make the same distinction 
<A NAME="952"></A>in speaking of the agent: for sometimes we say that 'the man', but at other 
<A NAME="953"></A>times that 'what is hot', produces heat.) Now the one group of thinkers 
<A NAME="954"></A>supposed that agent and patient must possess something identical, because 
<A NAME="955"></A>they fastened their attention on the substratum: while the other group 
<A NAME="956"></A>maintained the opposite because their attention was concentrated on the 
<A NAME="957"></A>'contraries'. We must conceive the same account to hold of action and passion 
<A NAME="958"></A>as that which is true of 'being moved' and 'imparting motion'. For the 
<A NAME="959"></A>'mover', like the 'agent', has two meanings. Both (a) that which contains 
<A NAME="960"></A>the originative source of the motion is thought to 'impart motion' (for 
<A NAME="961"></A>the originative source is first amongst the causes), and also (b) that 
<A NAME="962"></A>which is last, i.e. immediately next to the moved thing and to the coming-to-be. 
<A NAME="963"></A>A similar distinction holds also of the agent: for we speak not only (a) 
<A NAME="964"></A>of the doctor, but also (b) of the wine, as healing. Now, in motion, there 
<A NAME="965"></A>is nothing to prevent the firs; mover being unmoved (indeed, as regards 
<A NAME="966"></A>some 'first' movers' this is actually necessary) although the last mover 
<A NAME="967"></A>always imparts motion by being itself moved: and, in action, there is nothing 
<A NAME="968"></A>to prevent the first agent being unaffected, while the last agent only 
<A NAME="969"></A>acts by suffering action itself. For agent and patient have not the same 
<A NAME="970"></A>matter, agent acts without being affected: thus the art of healing produces 
<A NAME="971"></A>health without itself being acted upon in any way by that which is being 
<A NAME="972"></A>healed. But (b) the food, in acting, is itself in some way acted upon: 
<A NAME="973"></A>for, in acting, it is simultaneously heated or cooled or otherwise affected. 
<A NAME="974"></A>Now the art of healing corresponds to an 'originative source', while the 
<A NAME="975"></A>food corresponds to 'the last' (i.e. 'continuous') mover.
<A NAME="976"></A><BR><BR>Those active powers, then, whose forms are not embodied in matter, 
<A NAME="977"></A>are unaffected: but those whose forms are in matter are such as to be affected 
<A NAME="978"></A>in acting. For we maintain that one and the same 'matter' is equally, so 
<A NAME="979"></A>to say, the basis of either of the two opposed things-being as it were 
<A NAME="980"></A>a 'kind'; and that that which can he hot must be made hot, provided the 
<A NAME="981"></A>heating agent is there, i.e. comes near. Hence (as we have said) some of 
<A NAME="982"></A>the active powers are unaffected while others are such as to be affected; 
<A NAME="983"></A>and what holds of motion is true also of the active powers. For as in motion 
<A NAME="984"></A>'the first mover' is unmoved, so among the active powers 'the first agent' 
<A NAME="985"></A>is unaffected.
<A NAME="986"></A><BR><BR>The active power is a 'cause' in the sense of that from which the 
<A NAME="987"></A>process originates: but the end, for the sake of which it takes place, 
<A NAME="988"></A>is not 'active'. (That is why health is not 'active', except metaphorically.) 
<A NAME="989"></A>For when the agent is there, the patient he-comes something: but when 'states' 
<A NAME="990"></A>are there, the patient no longer becomes but already is-and 'forms' (i.e. 
<A NAME="991"></A>lends') are a kind of 'state'. As to the 'matter', it (qua matter) is passive. 
<A NAME="992"></A>Now fire contains 'the hot' embodied in matter: but a 'hot' separate from 
<A NAME="993"></A>matter (if such a thing existed) could not suffer any action. Perhaps, 
<A NAME="994"></A>indeed, it is impossible that 'the hot' should exist in separation from 
<A NAME="995"></A>matter: but if there are any entities thus separable, what we are saying 
<A NAME="996"></A>would be true of them.
<A NAME="997"></A><BR><BR>We have thus explained what action and passion are, what things 
<A NAME="998"></A>exhibit them, why they do so, and in what manner. We must go on to discuss 
<A NAME="999"></A>how it is possible for action and passion to take place.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="1000"></A><B>Part 8</B>

<A NAME="1001"></A><BR><BR>Some philosophers think that the 'last' agent-the 'agent' in the 
<A NAME="1002"></A>strictest sense-enters in through certain pores, and so the patient suffers 
<A NAME="1003"></A>action. It is in this way, they assert, that we see and hear and exercise 
<A NAME="1004"></A>all our other senses. Moreover, according to them, things are seen through 
<A NAME="1005"></A>air and water and other transparent bodies, because such bodies possess 
<A NAME="1006"></A>pores, invisible indeed owing to their minuteness, but close-set and arranged 
<A NAME="1007"></A>in rows: and the more transparent the body, the more frequent and serial 
<A NAME="1008"></A>they suppose its pores to be. Such was the theory which some philosophers 
<A NAME="1009"></A>(induding Empedocles) advanced in regard to the structure of certain bodies. 
<A NAME="1010"></A>They do not restrict it to the bodies which act and suffer action: but 
<A NAME="1011"></A>'combination' too, they say, takes place 'only between bodies whose pores 
<A NAME="1012"></A>are in reciprocal symmetry'. The most systematic and consistent theory, 
<A NAME="1013"></A>however, and one that applied to all bodies, was advanced by Leucippus 
<A NAME="1014"></A>and Democritus: and, in maintaining it, they took as their starting-point 
<A NAME="1015"></A>what naturally comes first.
<A NAME="1016"></A><BR><BR>For some of the older philosophers thought that 'what is' must 
<A NAME="1017"></A>of necessity be 'one' and immovable. The void, they argue, 'is not': but 
<A NAME="1018"></A>unless there is a void with a separate being of its own, 'what is' cannot 
<A NAME="1019"></A>be moved-nor again can it be 'many', since there is nothing to keep things 
<A NAME="1020"></A>apart. And in this respect, they insist, the view that the universe is 
<A NAME="1021"></A>not 'continuous' but 'discretes-in-contact' is no better than the view 
<A NAME="1022"></A>that there are 'many' (and not 'one') and a void. For (suppose that the 
<A NAME="1023"></A>universe is discretes-in-contact. Then), if it is divisible through and 
<A NAME="1024"></A>through, there is no 'one', and therefore no 'many' either, but the Whole 
<A NAME="1025"></A>is void; while to maintain that it is divisible at some points, but not 
<A NAME="1026"></A>at others, looks like an arbitrary fiction. For up to what limit is it 
<A NAME="1027"></A>divisible? And for what reason is part of the Whole indivisible, i.e. a 
<A NAME="1028"></A>plenum, and part divided? Further, they maintain, it is equally necessary 
<A NAME="1029"></A>to deny the existence of motion.
<A NAME="1030"></A><BR><BR>Reasoning in this way, therefore, they were led to transcend sense-perception, 
<A NAME="1031"></A>and to disregard it on the ground that 'one ought to follow the argument': 
<A NAME="1032"></A>and so they assert that the universe is 'one' and immovable. Some of them 
<A NAME="1033"></A>add that it is 'infinite', since the limit (if it had one) would be a limit 
<A NAME="1034"></A>against the void.
<A NAME="1035"></A><BR><BR>There were, then, certain thinkers who, for the reasons we have 
<A NAME="1036"></A>stated, enunciated views of this kind as their theory of 'The Truth'.... 
<A NAME="1037"></A>Moreover, although these opinions appear to follow logically in a dialectical 
<A NAME="1038"></A>discussion, yet to believe them seems next door to madness when one considers 
<A NAME="1039"></A>the facts. For indeed no lunatic seems to be so far out of his senses as 
<A NAME="1040"></A>to suppose that fire and ice are 'one': it is only between what is right 
<A NAME="1041"></A>and what seems right from habit, that some people are mad enough to see 
<A NAME="1042"></A>no difference.
<A NAME="1043"></A><BR><BR>Leucippus, however, thought he had a theory which harmonized with 
<A NAME="1044"></A>sense-perception and would not abolish either coming-to-be and passing-away 
<A NAME="1045"></A>or motion and the multiplicity of things. He made these concessions to 
<A NAME="1046"></A>the facts of perception: on the other hand, he conceded to the Monists 
<A NAME="1047"></A>that there could be no motion without a void. The result is a theory which 
<A NAME="1048"></A>he states as follows: 'The void is a "not being", and no part of "what 
<A NAME="1049"></A>is" is a "not-being"; for what "is" in the strict sense of the term is 
<A NAME="1050"></A>an absolute plenum. This plenum, however, is not "one": on the contrary, 
<A NAME="1051"></A>it is a many" infinite in number and invisible owing to the minuteness 
<A NAME="1052"></A>of their bulk. The "many" move in the void (for there is a void): and by 
<A NAME="1053"></A>coming together they produce "coming to-be", while by separating they produce 
<A NAME="1054"></A>"passing-away". Moreover, they act and suffer action wherever they chance 
<A NAME="1055"></A>to be in contact (for there they are not "one"), and they generate by being 
<A NAME="1056"></A>put together and becoming intertwined. From the genuinely-one, on the other 
<A NAME="1057"></A>hand, there never could have come-to-be a multiplicity, nor from the genuinely-many 
<A NAME="1058"></A>a "one": that is impossible. But' (just as Empedocles and some of the other 
<A NAME="1059"></A>philosophers say that things suffer action through their pores, so) 'all 
<A NAME="1060"></A>"alteration" and all "passion" take place in the way that has been explained: 
<A NAME="1061"></A>breaking-up (i.e. passing-away) is effected by means of the void, and so 
<A NAME="1062"></A>too is growth-solids creeping in to fill the void places.' Empedocles too 
<A NAME="1063"></A>is practically bound to adopt the same theory as Leucippus. For he must 
<A NAME="1064"></A>say that there are certain solids which, however, are indivisible-unless 
<A NAME="1065"></A>there are continuous pores all through the body. But this last alternative 
<A NAME="1066"></A>is impossible: for then there will be nothing solid in the body (nothing 
<A NAME="1067"></A>beside the pores) but all of it will be void. It is necessary, therefore, 
<A NAME="1068"></A>for his 'contiguous discretes' to be indivisible, while the intervals between 
<A NAME="1069"></A>them-which he calls 'pores'-must be void. But this is precisely Leucippus' 
<A NAME="1070"></A>theory of action and passion.
<A NAME="1071"></A><BR><BR>Such, approximately, are the current explanations of the manner 
<A NAME="1072"></A>in which some things 'act' while others 'suffer action'. And as regards 
<A NAME="1073"></A>the Atomists, it is not only clear what their explanation is: it is also 
<A NAME="1074"></A>obvious that it follows with tolerable consistency from the assumptions 
<A NAME="1075"></A>they employ. But there is less obvious consistency in the explanation offered 
<A NAME="1076"></A>by the other thinkers. It is not clear, for instance, how, on the theory 
<A NAME="1077"></A>of Empedocles, there is to be 'passing-away' as well as 'alteration'. For 
<A NAME="1078"></A>the primary bodies of the Atomists-the primary constituents of which bodies 
<A NAME="1079"></A>are composed, and the ultimate elements into which they are dissolved-are 
<A NAME="1080"></A>indivisible, differing from one another only in figure. In the philosophy 
<A NAME="1081"></A>of Empedocles, on the other hand, it is evident that all the other bodies 
<A NAME="1082"></A>down to the 'elements' have their coming-to-be and their passingaway: but 
<A NAME="1083"></A>it is not clear how the 'elements' themselves, severally in their aggregated 
<A NAME="1084"></A>masses, come-to-be and pass-away. Nor is it possible for Empedocles to 
<A NAME="1085"></A>explain how they do so, since he does not assert that Fire too (and similarly 
<A NAME="1086"></A>every one of his other 'elements') possesses 'elementary constituents' 
<A NAME="1087"></A>of itself.
<A NAME="1088"></A><BR><BR>Such an assertion would commit him to doctrines like those which
