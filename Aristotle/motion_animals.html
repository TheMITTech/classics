<A NAME="2"></A><BR><BR>By Aristotle
<A NAME="3"></A><BR><BR>Written 350 B.C.E
<BR><BR>Translated by A. S. L. Farquharson</DIV>
<BR><A NAME="start"></A>

<BR><BR>
<A NAME="10"></A><B>Part 1</B>

<BR><BR>
<A NAME="11"></A>Elsewhere we have investigated in detail the movement of animals after 
<A NAME="12"></A>their various kinds, the differences between them, and the reasons for 
<A NAME="13"></A>their particular characters (for some animals fly, some swim, some walk, 
<A NAME="14"></A>others move in various other ways); there remains an investigation of the 
<A NAME="15"></A>common ground of any sort of animal movement whatsoever.
<A NAME="16"></A><BR><BR>Now we have already determined (when we were discussing whether 
<A NAME="17"></A>eternal motion exists or not, and its definition, if it does exist) that 
<A NAME="18"></A>the origin of all other motions is that which moves itself, and that the 
<A NAME="19"></A>origin of this is the immovable, and that the prime mover must of necessity 
<A NAME="20"></A>be immovable. And we must grasp this not only generally in theory, but 
<A NAME="21"></A>also by reference to individuals in the world of sense, for with these 
<A NAME="22"></A>in view we seek general theories, and with these we believe that general 
<A NAME="23"></A>theories ought to harmonize. Now in the world of sense too it is plainly 
<A NAME="24"></A>impossible for movement to be initiated if there is nothing at rest, and 
<A NAME="25"></A>before all else in our present subject- animal life. For if one of the 
<A NAME="26"></A>parts of an animal be moved, another must be at rest, and this is the purpose 
<A NAME="27"></A>of their joints; animals use joints like a centre, and the whole member, 
<A NAME="28"></A>in which the joint is, becomes both one and two, both straight and bent, 
<A NAME="29"></A>changing potentially and actually by reason of the joint. And when it is 
<A NAME="30"></A>bending and being moved one of the points in the joint is moved and one 
<A NAME="31"></A>is at rest, just as if the points A and D of a diameter were at rest, and 
<A NAME="32"></A>B were moved, and DAC were generated. However, in the geometrical illustration, 
<A NAME="33"></A>the centre is held to be altogether indivisible (for in mathematics motion 
<A NAME="34"></A>is a fiction, as the phrase goes, no mathematical entity being really moved), 
<A NAME="35"></A>whereas in the case of joints the centres become now one potentially and 
<A NAME="36"></A>divided actually, and now one actually and divided potentially. But still 
<A NAME="37"></A>the origin of movement, qua origin, always remains at rest when the lower 
<A NAME="38"></A>part of a limb is moved; for example, the elbow joint, when the forearm 
<A NAME="39"></A>is moved, and the shoulder, when the whole arm; the knee when the tibia 
<A NAME="40"></A>is moved, and the hip when the whole leg. Accordingly it is plain that 
<A NAME="41"></A>each animal as a whole must have within itself a point at rest, whence 
<A NAME="42"></A>will be the origin of that which is moved, and supporting itself upon which 
<A NAME="43"></A>it will be moved both as a complete whole and in its 
<A NAME="44"></A>members.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="45"></A><B>Part 2</B>

<A NAME="46"></A><BR><BR>But the point of rest in the animal is still quite ineffectual 
<A NAME="47"></A>unless there be something without which is absolutely at rest and immovable. 
<A NAME="48"></A>Now it is worth while to pause and consider what has been said, for it 
<A NAME="49"></A>involves a speculation which extends beyond animals even to the motion 
<A NAME="50"></A>and march of the universe. For just as there must be something immovable 
<A NAME="51"></A>within the animal, if it is to be moved, so even more must there be without 
<A NAME="52"></A>it something immovable, by supporting itself upon which that which is moved 
<A NAME="53"></A>moves. For were that something always to give way (as it does for mice 
<A NAME="54"></A>walking in grain or persons walking in sand) advance would be impossible, 
<A NAME="55"></A>and neither would there be any walking unless the ground were to remain 
<A NAME="56"></A>still, nor any flying or swimming were not the air and the sea to resist. 
<A NAME="57"></A>And this which resists must needs be different from what is moved, the 
<A NAME="58"></A>whole of it from the whole of that, and what is thus immovable must be 
<A NAME="59"></A>no part of what is moved; otherwise there will be no movement. Evidence 
<A NAME="60"></A>of this lies in the problem why it is that a man easily moves a boat from 
<A NAME="61"></A>outside, if he push with a pole, putting it against the mast or some other 
<A NAME="62"></A>part, but if he tried to do this when in the boat itself he would never 
<A NAME="63"></A>move it, no not giant Tityus himself nor Boreas blowing from inside the 
<A NAME="64"></A>ship, if he really were blowing in the way painters represent him; for 
<A NAME="65"></A>they paint him sending the breath out from the boat. For whether one blew 
<A NAME="66"></A>gently or so stoutly as to make a very great wind, and whether what were 
<A NAME="67"></A>thrown or pushed were wind or something else, it is necessary in the first 
<A NAME="68"></A>place to be supported upon one of one's own members which is at rest and 
<A NAME="69"></A>so to push, and in the second place for this member, either itself, or 
<A NAME="70"></A>that of which it is a part, to remain at rest, fixing itself against something 
<A NAME="71"></A>external to itself. Now the man who is himself in the boat, if he pushes, 
<A NAME="72"></A>fixing himself against the boat, very naturally does not move the boat, 
<A NAME="73"></A>because what he pushes against should properly remain at rest. Now what 
<A NAME="74"></A>he is trying to move, and what he is fixing himself against is in his case 
<A NAME="75"></A>the same. If, however, he pushes or pulls from outside he does move it, 
<A NAME="76"></A>for the ground is no part of the boat.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="77"></A><B>Part 3</B>

<A NAME="78"></A><BR><BR>Here we may ask the difficult question whether if something moves 
<A NAME="79"></A>the whole heavens this mover must be immovable, and moreover be no part 
<A NAME="80"></A>of the heavens, nor in the heavens. For either it is moved itself and moves 
<A NAME="81"></A>the heavens, in which case it must touch something immovable in order to 
<A NAME="82"></A>create movement, and then this is no part of that which creates movement; 
<A NAME="83"></A>or if the mover is from the first immovable it will equally be no part 
<A NAME="84"></A>of that which is moved. In this point at least they argue correctly who 
<A NAME="85"></A>say that as the Sphere is carried round in a circle no single part remains 
<A NAME="86"></A>still, for then either the whole would necessarily stand still or its continuity 
<A NAME="87"></A>be torn asunder; but they argue less well in supposing that the poles have 
<A NAME="88"></A>a certain force, though conceived as having no magnitude, but as merely 
<A NAME="89"></A>termini or points. For besides the fact that no such things have any substantial 
<A NAME="90"></A>existence it is impossible for a single movement to be initiated by what 
<A NAME="91"></A>is twofold; and yet they make the poles two. From a review of these difficulties 
<A NAME="92"></A>we may conclude that there is something so related to the whole of Nature, 
<A NAME="93"></A>as the earth is to animals and things moved by them.
<A NAME="94"></A><BR><BR>And the mythologists with their fable of Atlas setting his feet 
<A NAME="95"></A>upon the earth appear to have based the fable upon intelligent grounds. 
<A NAME="96"></A>They make Atlas a kind of diameter twirling the heavens about the poles. 
<A NAME="97"></A>Now as the earth remains still this would be reasonable enough, but their 
<A NAME="98"></A>theory involves them in the position that the earth is no part of the universe. 
<A NAME="99"></A>And further the force of that which initiates movement must be made equal 
<A NAME="100"></A>to the force of that which remains at rest. For there is a definite quantity 
<A NAME="101"></A>of force or power by dint of which that which remains at rest does so, 
<A NAME="102"></A>just as there is of force by dint of which that which initiates movement 
<A NAME="103"></A>does so; and as there is a necessary proportion between opposite motions, 
<A NAME="104"></A>so there is between absences of motion. Now equal forces are unaffected 
<A NAME="105"></A>by one another, but are overcome by a superiority of force. And so in their 
<A NAME="106"></A>theory Atlas, or whatever similar power initiates movement from within, 
<A NAME="107"></A>must exert no more force than will exactly balance the stability of the 
<A NAME="108"></A>earth- otherwise the earth will be moved out of her place in the centre 
<A NAME="109"></A>of things. For as the pusher pushes so is the pushed pushed, and with equal 
<A NAME="110"></A>force. But the prime mover moves that which is to begin with at rest, so 
<A NAME="111"></A>that the power it exerts is greater, rather than equal and like to the 
<A NAME="112"></A>power which produces absence of motion in that which is moved. And similarly 
<A NAME="113"></A>also the power of what is moved and so moves must be greater than the power 
<A NAME="114"></A>of that which is moved but does not initiate movement. Therefore the force 
<A NAME="115"></A>of the earth in its immobility will have to be as great as the force of 
<A NAME="116"></A>the whole heavens, and of that which moves the heavens. But if that is 
<A NAME="117"></A>impossible, it follows that the heavens cannot possibly be moved by any 
<A NAME="118"></A>force of this kind inside them.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="119"></A><B>Part 4</B>

<A NAME="120"></A><BR><BR>There is a further difficulty about the motions of the parts of 
<A NAME="121"></A>the heavens which, as akin to what has gone before, may be considered next. 
<A NAME="122"></A>For if one could overcome by force of motion the immobility of the earth 
<A NAME="123"></A>he would clearly move it away from the centre. And it is plain that the 
<A NAME="124"></A>power from which this force would originate will not be infinite, for the 
<A NAME="125"></A>earth is not infinite and therefore its weight is not. Now there are more 
<A NAME="126"></A>senses than one of the word 'impossible'. When we say it is impossible 
<A NAME="127"></A>to see a sound, and when we say it is impossible to see the men in the 
<A NAME="128"></A>moon, we use two senses of the word; the former is of necessity, the latter, 
<A NAME="129"></A>though their nature is to be seen, cannot as a fact be seen by us. Now 
<A NAME="130"></A>we suppose that the heavens are of necessity impossible to destroy and 
<A NAME="131"></A>to dissolve, whereas the result of the present argument would be to do 
<A NAME="132"></A>away with this necessity. For it is natural and possible for a motion to 
<A NAME="133"></A>exist greater than the force by dint of which the earth is at rest, or 
<A NAME="134"></A>than that by dint of which Fire and Aether are moved. If then there are 
<A NAME="135"></A>superior motions, these will be dissolved in succession by one another: 
<A NAME="136"></A>and if there actually are not, but might possibly be (for the earth cannot 
<A NAME="137"></A>be infinite because no body can possibly be infinite), there is a possibility 
<A NAME="138"></A>of the heavens being dissolved. For what is to prevent this coming to pass, 
<A NAME="139"></A>unless it be impossible? And it is not impossible unless the opposite is 
<A NAME="140"></A>necessary. This difficulty, however, we will discuss 
<A NAME="141"></A>elsewhere.
<A NAME="142"></A><BR><BR>To resume, must there be something immovable and at rest outside 
<A NAME="143"></A>of what is moved, and no part of it, or not? And must this necessarily 
<A NAME="144"></A>be so also in the case of the universe? Perhaps it would be thought strange 
<A NAME="145"></A>were the origin of movement inside. And to those who so conceive it the 
<A NAME="146"></A>word of Homer would appear to have been well spoken:
<A NAME="147"></A><BR><BR>'Nay, ye would not pull Zeus, highest of all from heaven to the 
<A NAME="148"></A>plain, no not even if ye toiled right hard; come, all ye gods and goddesses! 
<A NAME="149"></A>Set hands to the chain'; for that which is entirely immovable cannot possibly 
<A NAME="150"></A>be moved by anything. And herein lies the solution of the difficulty stated 
<A NAME="151"></A>some time back, the possibility or impossibility of dissolving the system 
<A NAME="152"></A>of the heavens, in that it depends from an original which is 
<A NAME="153"></A>immovable.
<A NAME="154"></A><BR><BR>Now in the animal world there must be not only an immovable without, 
<A NAME="155"></A>but also within those things which move in place, and initiate their own 
<A NAME="156"></A>movement. For one part of an animal must be moved, and another be at rest, 
<A NAME="157"></A>and against this the part which is moved will support itself and be moved; 
<A NAME="158"></A>for example, if it move one of its parts; for one part, as it were, supports 
<A NAME="159"></A>itself against another part at rest.
<A NAME="160"></A><BR><BR>But about things without life which are moved one might ask the 
<A NAME="161"></A>question whether all contain in themselves both that which is at rest and 
<A NAME="162"></A>that which initiates movement, and whether they also, for instance fire, 
<A NAME="163"></A>earth, or any other inanimate thing, must support themselves against something 
<A NAME="164"></A>outside which is at rest. Or is this impossible and must it not be looked 
<A NAME="165"></A>for rather in those primary causes by which they are set in motion? For 
<A NAME="166"></A>all things without life are moved by something other, and the origin of 
<A NAME="167"></A>all things so moved are things which move themselves. And out of these 
<A NAME="168"></A>we have spoken about animals (for they must all have in themselves that 
<A NAME="169"></A>which is at rest, and without them that against which they are supported); 
<A NAME="170"></A>but whether there is some higher and prime mover is not clear, and an origin 
<A NAME="171"></A>of that kind involves a different discussion. Animals at any rate which 
<A NAME="172"></A>move themselves are all moved supporting themselves on what is outside 
<A NAME="173"></A>them, even when they inspire and expire; for there is no essential difference 
<A NAME="174"></A>between casting a great and a small weight, and this is what men do when 
<A NAME="175"></A>they spit and cough and when they breathe in and breathe 
<A NAME="176"></A>out.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="177"></A><B>Part 5</B>

<A NAME="178"></A><BR><BR>But is it only in that which moves itself in place that there must 
<A NAME="179"></A>be a point at rest, or does this hold also of that which causes its own 
<A NAME="180"></A>qualitative changes, and its own growth? Now the question of original generation 
<A NAME="181"></A>and decay is different; for if there is, as we hold, a primary movement, 
<A NAME="182"></A>this would be the cause of generation and decay, and probably of all the 
<A NAME="183"></A>secondary movements too. And as in the universe, so in the animal world 
<A NAME="184"></A>this is the primary movement, when the creature attains maturity; and therefore 
<A NAME="185"></A>it is the cause of growth, when the creature becomes the cause of its own 
<A NAME="186"></A>growth, and the cause too of alteration. But if this is not the primary 
<A NAME="187"></A>movement then the point at rest is not necessary. However, the earliest 
<A NAME="188"></A>growth and alteration in the living creature arise through another and 
<A NAME="189"></A>by other channels, nor can anything possibly be the cause of its own generation 
<A NAME="190"></A>and decay, for the mover must exist before the moved, the begetter before 
<A NAME="191"></A>the begotten, and nothing is prior to itself.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="192"></A><B>Part 6</B>

<A NAME="193"></A><BR><BR>Now whether the soul is moved or not, and how it is moved if it 
<A NAME="194"></A>be moved, has been stated before in our treatise concerning it. And since 
<A NAME="195"></A>all inorganic things are moved by some other thing- and the manner of the 
<A NAME="196"></A>movement of the first and eternally moved, and how the first mover moves 
<A NAME="197"></A>it, has been determined before in our Metaphysics, it remains to inquire 
<A NAME="198"></A>how the soul moves the body, and what is the origin of movement in a living 
<A NAME="199"></A>creature. For, if we except the movement of the universe, things with life 
<A NAME="200"></A>are the causes of the movement of all else, that is of all that are not 
<A NAME="201"></A>moved by one another by mutual impact. And so all their motions have a 
<A NAME="202"></A>term or limit, inasmuch as the movements of things with life have such. 
<A NAME="203"></A>For all living things both move and are moved with some object, so that 
<A NAME="204"></A>this is the term of all their movement, the end, that is, in view. Now 
<A NAME="205"></A>we see that the living creature is moved by intellect, imagination, purpose, 
<A NAME="206"></A>wish, and appetite. And all these are reducible to mind and desire. For 
<A NAME="207"></A>both imagination and sensation are on common ground with mind, since all 
<A NAME="208"></A>three are faculties of judgement though differing according to distinctions 
<A NAME="209"></A>stated elsewhere. Will, however, impulse, and appetite, are all three forms 
<A NAME="210"></A>of desire, while purpose belongs both to intellect and to desire. Therefore 
<A NAME="211"></A>the object of desire or of intellect first initiates movement, not, that 
<A NAME="212"></A>is, every object of intellect, only the end in the domain of conduct. Accordingly 
<A NAME="213"></A>among goods that which moves is a practical end, not the good in its whole 
<A NAME="214"></A>extent. For it initiates movement only so far as something else is for 
<A NAME="215"></A>its sake, or so far as it is the object of that which is for the sake of 
<A NAME="216"></A>something else. And we must suppose that a seeming good may take the room 
<A NAME="217"></A>of actual good, and so may the pleasant, which is itself a seeming good. 
<A NAME="218"></A>From these considerations it is clear that in one regard that which is 
<A NAME="219"></A>eternally moved by the eternal mover is moved in the same way as every 
<A NAME="220"></A>living creature, in another regard differently, and so while it is moved 
<A NAME="221"></A>eternally, the movement of living creatures has a term. Now the eternal 
<A NAME="222"></A>beautiful, and the truly and primarily good (which is not at one time good, 
<A NAME="223"></A>at another time not good), is too divine and precious to be relative to 
<A NAME="224"></A>anything else. The prime mover then moves, itself being unmoved, whereas 
<A NAME="225"></A>desire and its faculty are moved and so move. But it is not necessary for 
<A NAME="226"></A>the last in the chain of things moved to move something else; wherefore 
<A NAME="227"></A>it is plainly reasonable that motion in place should be the last of what 
<A NAME="228"></A>happens in the region of things happening, since the living creature is 
<A NAME="229"></A>moved and goes forward by reason of desire or purpose, when some alteration 
<A NAME="230"></A>has been set going on the occasion of sensation or imagination.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="231"></A><B>Part 7</B>

<A NAME="232"></A><BR><BR>But how is it that thought (viz. sense, imagination, and thought 
<A NAME="233"></A>proper) is sometimes followed by action, sometimes not; sometimes by movement, 
<A NAME="234"></A>sometimes not? What happens seems parallel to the case of thinking and 
<A NAME="235"></A>inferring about the immovable objects of science. There the end is the 
<A NAME="236"></A>truth seen (for, when one conceives the two premisses, one at once conceives 
<A NAME="237"></A>and comprehends the conclusion), but here the two premisses result in a 
<A NAME="238"></A>conclusion which is an action- for example, one conceives that every man 
<A NAME="239"></A>ought to walk, one is a man oneself: straightway one walks; or that, in 
<A NAME="240"></A>this case, no man should walk, one is a man: straightway one remains at 
<A NAME="241"></A>rest. And one so acts in the two cases provided that there is nothing in 
<A NAME="242"></A>the one case to compel or in the other to prevent. Again, I ought to create 
<A NAME="243"></A>a good, a house is good: straightway I make a house. I need a covering, 
<A NAME="244"></A>a coat is a covering: I need a coat. What I need I ought to make, I need 
<A NAME="245"></A>a coat: I make a coat. And the conclusion I must make a coat is an action. 
<A NAME="246"></A>And the action goes back to the beginning or first step. If there is to 
<A NAME="247"></A>be a coat, one must first have B, and if B then A, so one gets A to begin 
<A NAME="248"></A>with. Now that the action is the conclusion is clear. But the premisses 
<A NAME="249"></A>of action are of two kinds, of the good and of the possible.
<A NAME="250"></A><BR><BR>And as in some cases of speculative inquiry we suppress one premise 
<A NAME="251"></A>so here the mind does not stop to consider at all an obvious minor premise; 
<A NAME="252"></A>for example if walking is good for man, one does not dwell upon the minor 
<A NAME="253"></A>'I am a man'. And so what we do without reflection, we do quickly. For 
<A NAME="254"></A>when a man actualizes himself in relation to his object either by perceiving, 
<A NAME="255"></A>or imagining or conceiving it, what he desires he does at once. For the 
<A NAME="256"></A>actualizing of desire is a substitute for inquiry or reflection. I want 
<A NAME="257"></A>to drink, says appetite; this is drink, says sense or imagination or mind: 
<A NAME="258"></A>straightway I drink. In this way living creatures are impelled to move 
<A NAME="259"></A>and to act, and desire is the last or immediate cause of movement, and 
<A NAME="260"></A>desire arises after perception or after imagination and conception. And 
<A NAME="261"></A>things that desire to act now create and now act under the influence of 
<A NAME="262"></A>appetite or impulse or of desire or wish.
<A NAME="263"></A><BR><BR>The movements of animals may be compared with those of automatic 
<A NAME="264"></A>puppets, which are set going on the occasion of a tiny movement; the levers 
<A NAME="265"></A>are released, and strike the twisted strings against one another; or with 
<A NAME="266"></A>the toy wagon. For the child mounts on it and moves it straight forward, 
<A NAME="267"></A>and then again it is moved in a circle owing to its wheels being of unequal 
<A NAME="268"></A>diameter (the smaller acts like a centre on the same principle as the cylinders). 
<A NAME="269"></A>Animals have parts of a similar kind, their organs, the sinewy tendons 
<A NAME="270"></A>to wit and the bones; the bones are like the wooden levers in the automaton, 
<A NAME="271"></A>and the iron; the tendons are like the strings, for when these are tightened 
<A NAME="272"></A>or leased movement begins. However, in the automata and the toy wagon there 
<A NAME="273"></A>is no change of quality, though if the inner wheels became smaller and 
<A NAME="274"></A>greater by turns there would be the same circular movement set up. In an 
<A NAME="275"></A>animal the same part has the power of becoming now larger and now smaller, 
<A NAME="276"></A>and changing its form, as the parts increase by warmth and again contract 
<A NAME="277"></A>by cold and change their quality. This change of quality is caused by imaginations 
<A NAME="278"></A>and sensations and by ideas. Sensations are obviously a form of change 
<A NAME="279"></A>of quality, and imagination and conception have the same effect as the 
<A NAME="280"></A>objects so imagined and conceived For in a measure the form conceived be 
<A NAME="281"></A>it of hot or cold or pleasant or fearful is like what the actual objects 
<A NAME="282"></A>would be, and so we shudder and are frightened at a mere idea. Now all 
<A NAME="283"></A>these affections involve changes of quality, and with those changes some 
<A NAME="284"></A>parts of the body enlarge, others grow smaller. And it is not hard to see 
<A NAME="285"></A>that a small change occurring at the centre makes great and numerous changes 
<A NAME="286"></A>at the circumference, just as by shifting the rudder a hair's breadth you 
<A NAME="287"></A>get a wide deviation at the prow. And further, when by reason of heat or 
<A NAME="288"></A>cold or some kindred affection a change is set up in the region of the 
<A NAME="289"></A>heart, even in an imperceptibly small part of the heart, it produces a 
<A NAME="290"></A>vast difference in the periphery of the body,- blushing, let us say, or 
<A NAME="291"></A>turning white, goose-skin and shivers and their opposites.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="292"></A><B>Part 8</B>

<A NAME="293"></A><BR><BR>But to return, the object we pursue or avoid in the field of action 
<A NAME="294"></A>is, as has been explained, the original of movement, and upon the conception 
<A NAME="295"></A>and imagination of this there necessarily follows a change in the temperature 
<A NAME="296"></A>of the body. For what is painful we avoid, what is pleasing we pursue. 
<A NAME="297"></A>We are, however, unconscious of what happens in the minute parts; still 
<A NAME="298"></A>anything painful or pleasing is generally speaking accompanied by a definite 
<A NAME="299"></A>change of temperature in the body. One may see this by considering the 
<A NAME="300"></A>affections. Blind courage and panic fears, erotic motions, and the rest 
<A NAME="301"></A>of the corporeal affections, pleasant and painful, are all accompanied 
<A NAME="302"></A>by a change of temperature, some in a particular member, others in the 
<A NAME="303"></A>body generally. So, memories and anticipations, using as it were the reflected 
<A NAME="304"></A>images of these pleasures and pains, are now more and now less causes of 
<A NAME="305"></A>the same changes of temperature. And so we see the reason of nature's handiwork 
<A NAME="306"></A>in the inward parts, and in the centres of movement of the organic members; 
<A NAME="307"></A>they change from solid to moist, and from moist to solid, from soft to 
<A NAME="308"></A>hard and vice versa. And so when these are affected in this way, and when 
<A NAME="309"></A>besides the passive and active have the constitution we have many times 
<A NAME="310"></A>described, as often as it comes to pass that one is active and the other 
<A NAME="311"></A>passive, and neither of them falls short of the elements of its essence, 
<A NAME="312"></A>straightway one acts and the other responds. And on this account thinking 
<A NAME="313"></A>that one ought to go and going are virtually simultaneous, unless there 
<A NAME="314"></A>be something else to hinder action. The organic parts are suitably prepared 
<A NAME="315"></A>by the affections, these again by desire, and desire by imagination. Imagination 
<A NAME="316"></A>in its turn depends either upon conception or sense-perception. And the 
<A NAME="317"></A>simultaneity and speed are due to the natural correspondence of the active 
<A NAME="318"></A>and passive.
<A NAME="319"></A><BR><BR>However, that which first moves the animal organism must be situate 
<A NAME="320"></A>in a definite original. Now we have said that a joint is the beginning 
<A NAME="321"></A>of one part of a limb, the end of another. And so nature employs it sometimes 
<A NAME="322"></A>as one, sometimes as two. When movement arises from a joint, one of the 
<A NAME="323"></A>extreme points must remain at rest, and the other be moved (for as we explained 
<A NAME="324"></A>above the mover must support itself against a point at rest); accordingly, 
<A NAME="325"></A>in the case of the elbow-joint, the last point of the forearm is moved 
<A NAME="326"></A>but does not move anything, while, in the flexion, one point of the elbow, 
<A NAME="327"></A>which lies in the whole forearm that is being moved, is moved, but there 
<A NAME="328"></A>must also be a point which is unmoved, and this is our meaning when we 
<A NAME="329"></A>speak of a point which is in potency one, but which becomes two in actual 
<A NAME="330"></A>exercise. Now if the arm were the living animal, somewhere in its elbow-joint 
<A NAME="331"></A>would be situate the original seat of the moving soul. Since, however, 
<A NAME="332"></A>it is possible for a lifeless thing to be so related to the hand as the 
<A NAME="333"></A>forearm is to the upper (for example, when a man moves a stick in his hand), 
<A NAME="334"></A>it is evident that the soul, the original of movement, could not lie in 
<A NAME="335"></A>either of the two extreme points, neither, that is, in the last point of 
<A NAME="336"></A>the stick which is moved, nor in the original point which causes movement. 
<A NAME="337"></A>For the stick too has an end point and an originative point by reference 
<A NAME="338"></A>to the hand. Accordingly, this example shows that the moving original which 
<A NAME="339"></A>derives from the soul is not in the stick and if not, then not in the hand; 
<A NAME="340"></A>for a precisely similar relation obtains between the hand and the wrist, 
<A NAME="341"></A>as between the wrist and the elbow. In this matter it makes no difference 
<A NAME="342"></A>whether the part is a continuous part of the body or not; the stick may 
<A NAME="343"></A>be looked at as a detached part of the whole. It follows then of necessity 
<A NAME="344"></A>that the original cannot lie in any individual origin which is the end 
<A NAME="345"></A>of another member, even though there may lie another part outside the one 
<A NAME="346"></A>in question. For example, relatively to the end point of the stick the 
<A NAME="347"></A>hand is the original, but the original of the hand's movement is in the 
<A NAME="348"></A>wrist. And so if the true original is not in the hand, be-there is still 
<A NAME="349"></A>something higher up, neither is the true original in the wrist, for once 
<A NAME="350"></A>more if the elbow is at rest the whole part below it can be moved as a 
<A NAME="351"></A>continuous whole.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="352"></A><B>Part 9</B>

<A NAME="353"></A><BR><BR>Now since the left and the right sides are symmetrical, and these 
<A NAME="354"></A>opposites are moved simultaneously, it cannot be that the left is moved 
<A NAME="355"></A>by the right remaining stationary, nor vice versa; the original must always 
<A NAME="356"></A>be in what lies above both. Therefore, the original seat of the moving 
<A NAME="357"></A>soul must be in that which lies in the middle, for of both extremes the 
<A NAME="358"></A>middle is the limiting point; and this is similarly related to the movements 
<A NAME="359"></A>from above [and below,] those that is from the head, and to the bones which 
<A NAME="360"></A>spring from the spinal column, in creatures that have a spinal 
<A NAME="361"></A>column.
<A NAME="362"></A><BR><BR>And this is a reasonable arrangement. For the sensorium is in our 
<A NAME="363"></A>opinion in the centre too; and so, if the region of the original of movement 
<A NAME="364"></A>is altered in structure through sense-perception and thus changes, it carries 
<A NAME="365"></A>with it the parts that depend upon it and they too are extended or contracted, 
<A NAME="366"></A>and in this way the movement of the creature necessarily follows. And the 
<A NAME="367"></A>middle of the body must needs be in potency one but in action more than 
<A NAME="368"></A>one; for the limbs are moved simultaneously from the original seat of movement, 
<A NAME="369"></A>and when one is at rest the other is moved. For example, in the line BAC, 
<A NAME="370"></A>B is moved, and A is the mover. There must, however, be a point at rest 
<A NAME="371"></A>if one is to move, the other to be moved. A (AE) then being one in potency 
<A NAME="372"></A>must be two in action, and so be a definite spatial magnitude not a mathematical 
<A NAME="373"></A>point. Again, C may be moved simultaneously with B. Both the originals 
<A NAME="374"></A>then in A must move and be, and so there must be something other than them 
<A NAME="375"></A>which moves but is not moved. For otherwise, when the movement begins, 
<A NAME="376"></A>the extremes, i.e. the originals, in A would rest upon one another, like 
<A NAME="377"></A>two men putting themselves back to back and so moving their legs. There 
<A NAME="378"></A>must then be some one thing which moves both. This something is the soul, 
<A NAME="379"></A>distinct from the spatial magnitude just described and yet located 
<A NAME="380"></A>therein.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="381"></A><B>Part 10</B>

<A NAME="382"></A><BR><BR>Although from the point of view of the definition of movement- 
<A NAME="383"></A>a definition which gives the cause- desire is the middle term or cause, 
<A NAME="384"></A>and desire moves being moved, still in the material animated body there 
<A NAME="385"></A>must be some material which itself moves being moved. Now that which is 
<A NAME="386"></A>moved, but whose nature is not to initiate movement, is capable of being 
<A NAME="387"></A>passive to an external force, while that which initiates movement must 
<A NAME="388"></A>needs possess a kind of force and power. Now experience shows us that animals 
<A NAME="389"></A>do both possess connatural spirit and derive power from this. (How this 
<A NAME="390"></A>connatural spirit is maintained in the body is explained in other passages 
<A NAME="391"></A>of our works.) And this spirit appears to stand to the soul-centre or original 
<A NAME="392"></A>in a relation analogous to that between the point in a joint which moves 
<A NAME="393"></A>being moved and the unmoved. Now since this centre is for some animals 
<A NAME="394"></A>in the heart, in the rest in a part analogous with the heart, we further 
<A NAME="395"></A>see the reason for the connatural spirit being situate where it actually 
<A NAME="396"></A>is found. The question whether the spirit remains always the same or constantly 
<A NAME="397"></A>changes and is renewed, like the cognate question about the rest of the 
<A NAME="398"></A>parts of the body, is better postponed. At all events we see that it is 
<A NAME="399"></A>well disposed to excite movement and to exert power; and the functions 
<A NAME="400"></A>of movement are thrusting and pulling. Accordingly, the organ of movement 
<A NAME="401"></A>must be capable of expanding and contracting; and this is precisely the 
<A NAME="402"></A>characteristic of spirit. It contracts and expands naturally, and so is 
<A NAME="403"></A>able to pull and to thrust from one and the same cause, exhibiting gravity 
<A NAME="404"></A>compared with the fiery element, and levity by comparison with the opposites 
<A NAME="405"></A>of fire. Now that which is to initiate movement without change of structure 
<A NAME="406"></A>must be of the kind described, for the elementary bodies prevail over one 
<A NAME="407"></A>another in a compound body by dint of disproportion; the light is overcome 
<A NAME="408"></A>and kept down by the heavier, and the heavy kept up by the 
<A NAME="409"></A>lighter.
<A NAME="410"></A><BR><BR>We have now explained what the part is which is moved when the 
<A NAME="411"></A>soul originates movement in the body, and what is the reason for this. 
<A NAME="412"></A>And the animal organism must be conceived after the similitude of a well-governed 
<A NAME="413"></A>commonwealth. When order is once established in it there is no more need 
<A NAME="414"></A>of a separate monarch to preside over each several task. The individuals 
<A NAME="415"></A>each play their assigned part as it is ordered, and one thing follows another 
<A NAME="416"></A>in its accustomed order. So in animals there is the same orderliness- nature 
<A NAME="417"></A>taking the place of custom- and each part naturally doing his own work 
<A NAME="418"></A>as nature has composed them. There is no need then of a soul in each part, 
<A NAME="419"></A>but she resides in a kind of central governing place of the body, and the 
<A NAME="420"></A>remaining parts live by continuity of natural structure, and play the parts 
<A NAME="421"></A>Nature would have them play.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="422"></A><B>Part 11</B>

<A NAME="423"></A><BR><BR>So much then for the voluntary movements of animal bodies, and 
<A NAME="424"></A>the reasons for them. These bodies, however, display in certain members 
<A NAME="425"></A>involuntary movements too, but most often non-voluntary movements. By involuntary 
<A NAME="426"></A>I mean motions of the heart and of the privy member; for often upon an 
<A NAME="427"></A>image arising and without express mandate of the reason these parts are 
<A NAME="428"></A>moved. By non-voluntary I mean sleep and waking and respiration, and other 
<A NAME="429"></A>similar organic movements. For neither imagination nor desire is properly 
<A NAME="430"></A>mistress of any of these; but since the animal body must undergo natural 
<A NAME="431"></A>changes of quality, and when the parts are so altered some must increase 
<A NAME="432"></A>and other decrease, the body must straightway be moved and change with 
<A NAME="433"></A>the changes that nature makes dependent upon one another. Now the causes 
<A NAME="434"></A>of the movements are natural changes of temperature, both those coming 
<A NAME="435"></A>from outside the body, and those taking place within it. So the involuntary 
<A NAME="436"></A>movements which occur in spite of reason in the aforesaid parts occur when 
<A NAME="437"></A>a change of quality supervenes. For conception and imagination, as we said 
<A NAME="438"></A>above, produce the conditions necessary to affections, since they bring 
<A NAME="439"></A>to bear the images or forms which tend to create these states. And the 
<A NAME="440"></A>two parts aforesaid display this motion more conspicuously than the rest, 
<A NAME="441"></A>because each is in a sense a separate vital organism, the reason being 
<A NAME="442"></A>that each contains vital moisture. In the case of the heart the cause is 
<A NAME="443"></A>plain, for the heart is the seat of the senses, while an indication that 
<A NAME="444"></A>the generative organ too is vital is that there flows from it the seminal 
<A NAME="445"></A>potency, itself a kind of organism. Again, it is a reasonable arrangement 
<A NAME="446"></A>that the movements arise in the centre upon movements in the parts, and 
<A NAME="447"></A>in the parts upon movements in the centre, and so reach one another. Conceive 
<A NAME="448"></A>A to be the centre or starting point. The movements then arrive at the 
<A NAME="449"></A>centre from each letter in the diagram we have drawn, and flow back again 
<A NAME="450"></A>from the centre which is moved and changes, (for the centre is potentially 
<A NAME="451"></A>multiple) the movement of B goes to B, that of C to C, the movement of 
<A NAME="452"></A>both to both; but from B to C the movements flow by dint of going from 
<A NAME="453"></A>B to A as to a centre, and then from A to C as from a 
<A NAME="454"></A>centre.
<A NAME="455"></A><BR><BR>Moreover a movement contrary to reason sometimes does and sometimes 
<A NAME="456"></A>does not arise in the organs on the occasion of the same thoughts; the 
<A NAME="457"></A>reason is that sometimes the matter which is passive to the impressions 
<A NAME="458"></A>is there in sufficient quantity and of the right quality and sometimes 
<A NAME="459"></A>not.
<A NAME="460"></A><BR><BR>And so we have finished our account of the reasons for the parts 
<A NAME="461"></A>of each kind of animal, of the soul, and furthere of sense-perception, 
<A NAME="462"></A>of sleep, of memory, and of movement in general; it remains to speak of 
<A NAME="463"></A>animal generation.
