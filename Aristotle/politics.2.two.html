<A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A><B>Part I</B>
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="11"></A>Our urpose is to consider what form of political community is best of all 
<A NAME="12"></A>for those who are most able to realize their ideal of life. We must therefore 
<A NAME="13"></A>examine not only this but other constitutions, both such as actually exist 
<A NAME="14"></A>in well-governed states, and any theoretical forms which are held in esteem; 
<A NAME="15"></A>that what is good and useful may be brought to light. And let no one suppose 
<A NAME="16"></A>that in seeking for something beyond them we are anxious to make a sophistical 
<A NAME="17"></A>display at any cost; we only undertake this inquiry because all the constitutions 
<A NAME="18"></A>with which we are acquainted are faulty.
<A NAME="19"></A><BR><BR>We will begin with the natural beginning of the subject. Three 
<A NAME="20"></A>alternatives are conceivable: The members of a state must either have (1) 
<A NAME="21"></A>all things or (2) nothing in common, or (3) some things in common and some 
<A NAME="22"></A>not. That they should have nothing in common is clearly impossible, for 
<A NAME="23"></A>the constitution is a community, and must at any rate have a common place- 
<A NAME="24"></A>one city will be in one place, and the citizens are those who share in 
<A NAME="25"></A>that one city. But should a well ordered state have all things, as far 
<A NAME="26"></A>as may be, in common, or some only and not others? For the citizens might 
<A NAME="27"></A>conceivably have wives and children and property in common, as Socrates 
<A NAME="28"></A>proposes in the Republic of Plato. Which is better, our present condition, 
<A NAME="29"></A>or the proposed new order of society.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="30"></A><B>Part II</B>

<A NAME="31"></A><BR><BR>There are many difficulties in the community of women. And the 
<A NAME="32"></A>principle on which Socrates rests the necessity of such an institution 
<A NAME="33"></A>evidently is not established by his arguments. Further, as a means to the 
<A NAME="34"></A>end which he ascribes to the state, the scheme, taken literally is impracticable, 
<A NAME="35"></A>and how we are to interpret it is nowhere precisely stated. I am speaking 
<A NAME="36"></A>of the premise from which the argument of Socrates proceeds, 'that the 
<A NAME="37"></A>greater the unity of the state the better.' Is it not obvious that a state 
<A NAME="38"></A>may at length attain such a degree of unity as to be no longer a state? 
<A NAME="39"></A>since the nature of a state is to be a plurality, and in tending to greater 
<A NAME="40"></A>unity, from being a state, it becomes a family, and from being a family, 
<A NAME="41"></A>an individual; for the family may be said to be more than the state, and 
<A NAME="42"></A>the individual than the family. So that we ought not to attain this greatest 
<A NAME="43"></A>unity even if we could, for it would be the destruction of the state. Again, 
<A NAME="44"></A>a state is not made up only of so many men, but of different kinds of men; 
<A NAME="45"></A>for similars do not constitute a state. It is not like a military alliance 
<A NAME="46"></A>The usefulness of the latter depends upon its quantity even where there 
<A NAME="47"></A>is no difference in quality (for mutual protection is the end aimed at), 
<A NAME="48"></A>just as a greater weight of anything is more useful than a less (in like 
<A NAME="49"></A>manner, a state differs from a nation, when the nation has not its population 
<A NAME="50"></A>organized in villages, but lives an Arcadian sort of life); but the elements 
<A NAME="51"></A>out of which a unity is to be formed differ in kind. Wherefore the principle 
<A NAME="52"></A>of compensation, as I have already remarked in the Ethics, is the salvation 
<A NAME="53"></A>of states. Even among freemen and equals this is a principle which must 
<A NAME="54"></A>be maintained, for they cannot an rule together, but must change at the 
<A NAME="55"></A>end of a year or some other period of time or in some order of succession. 
<A NAME="56"></A>The result is that upon this plan they all govern; just as if shoemakers 
<A NAME="57"></A>and carpenters were to exchange their occupations, and the same persons 
<A NAME="58"></A>did not always continue shoemakers and carpenters. And since it is better 
<A NAME="59"></A>that this should be so in politics as well, it is clear that while there 
<A NAME="60"></A>should be continuance of the same persons in power where this is possible, 
<A NAME="61"></A>yet where this is not possible by reason of the natural equality of the 
<A NAME="62"></A>citizens, and at the same time it is just that an should share in the government 
<A NAME="63"></A>(whether to govern be a good thing or a bad), an approximation to this 
<A NAME="64"></A>is that equals should in turn retire from office and should, apart from 
<A NAME="65"></A>official position, be treated alike. Thus the one party rule and the others 
<A NAME="66"></A>are ruled in turn, as if they were no longer the same persons. In like 
<A NAME="67"></A>manner when they hold office there is a variety in the offices held. Hence 
<A NAME="68"></A>it is evident that a city is not by nature one in that sense which some 
<A NAME="69"></A>persons affirm; and that what is said to be the greatest good of cities 
<A NAME="70"></A>is in reality their destruction; but surely the good of things must be 
<A NAME="71"></A>that which preserves them. Again, in another point of view, this extreme 
<A NAME="72"></A>unification of the state is clearly not good; for a family is more self-sufficing 
<A NAME="73"></A>than an individual, and a city than a family, and a city only comes into 
<A NAME="74"></A>being when the community is large enough to be self-sufficing. If then 
<A NAME="75"></A>self-sufficiency is to be desired, the lesser degree of unity is more desirable 
<A NAME="76"></A>than the greater.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="77"></A><B>Part III</B>

<A NAME="78"></A><BR><BR>But, even supposing that it were best for the community to have 
<A NAME="79"></A>the greatest degree of unity, this unity is by no means proved to follow 
<A NAME="80"></A>from the fact 'of all men saying "mine" and "not mine" at the same instant 
<A NAME="81"></A>of time,' which, according to Socrates, is the sign of perfect unity in 
<A NAME="82"></A>a state. For the word 'all' is ambiguous. If the meaning be that every 
<A NAME="83"></A>individual says 'mine' and 'not mine' at the same time, then perhaps the 
<A NAME="84"></A>result at which Socrates aims may be in some degree accomplished; each 
<A NAME="85"></A>man will call the same person his own son and the same person his wife, 
<A NAME="86"></A>and so of his property and of all that falls to his lot. This, however, 
<A NAME="87"></A>is not the way in which people would speak who had their had their wives 
<A NAME="88"></A>and children in common; they would say 'all' but not 'each.' In like manner 
<A NAME="89"></A>their property would be described as belonging to them, not severally but 
<A NAME="90"></A>collectively. There is an obvious fallacy in the term 'all': like some 
<A NAME="91"></A>other words, 'both,' 'odd,' 'even,' it is ambiguous, and even in abstract 
<A NAME="92"></A>argument becomes a source of logical puzzles. That all persons call the 
<A NAME="93"></A>same thing mine in the sense in which each does so may be a fine thing, 
<A NAME="94"></A>but it is impracticable; or if the words are taken in the other sense, 
<A NAME="95"></A>such a unity in no way conduces to harmony. And there is another objection 
<A NAME="96"></A>to the proposal. For that which is common to the greatest number has the 
<A NAME="97"></A>least care bestowed upon it. Every one thinks chiefly of his own, hardly 
<A NAME="98"></A>at all of the common interest; and only when he is himself concerned as 
<A NAME="99"></A>an individual. For besides other considerations, everybody is more inclined 
<A NAME="100"></A>to neglect the duty which he expects another to fulfill; as in families 
<A NAME="101"></A>many attendants are often less useful than a few. Each citizen will have 
<A NAME="102"></A>a thousand sons who will not be his sons individually but anybody will 
<A NAME="103"></A>be equally the son of anybody, and will therefore be neglected by all alike. 
<A NAME="104"></A>Further, upon this principle, every one will use the word 'mine' of one 
<A NAME="105"></A>who is prospering or the reverse, however small a fraction he may himself 
<A NAME="106"></A>be of the whole number; the same boy will be 'so and so's son,' the son 
<A NAME="107"></A>of each of the thousand, or whatever be the number of the citizens; and 
<A NAME="108"></A>even about this he will not be positive; for it is impossible to know who 
<A NAME="109"></A>chanced to have a child, or whether, if one came into existence, it has 
<A NAME="110"></A>survived. But which is better- for each to say 'mine' in this way, making 
<A NAME="111"></A>a man the same relation to two thousand or ten thousand citizens, or to 
<A NAME="112"></A>use the word 'mine' in the ordinary and more restricted sense? For usually 
<A NAME="113"></A>the same person is called by one man his own son whom another calls his 
<A NAME="114"></A>own brother or cousin or kinsman- blood relation or connection by marriage 
<A NAME="115"></A>either of himself or of some relation of his, and yet another his clansman 
<A NAME="116"></A>or tribesman; and how much better is it to be the real cousin of somebody 
<A NAME="117"></A>than to be a son after Plato's fashion! Nor is there any way of preventing 
<A NAME="118"></A>brothers and children and fathers and mothers from sometimes recognizing 
<A NAME="119"></A>one another; for children are born like their parents, and they will necessarily 
<A NAME="120"></A>be finding indications of their relationship to one another. Geographers 
<A NAME="121"></A>declare such to be the fact; they say that in part of Upper Libya, where 
<A NAME="122"></A>the women are common, nevertheless the children who are born are assigned 
<A NAME="123"></A>to their respective fathers on the ground of their likeness. And some women, 
<A NAME="124"></A>like the females of other animals- for example, mares and cows- have a 
<A NAME="125"></A>strong tendency to produce offspring resembling their parents, as was the 
<A NAME="126"></A>case with the Pharsalian mare called Honest.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="127"></A><B>Part IV</B>

<A NAME="128"></A><BR><BR>Other evils, against which it is not easy for the authors of such 
<A NAME="129"></A>a community to guard, will be assaults and homicides, voluntary as well 
<A NAME="130"></A>as involuntary, quarrels and slanders, all which are most unholy acts when 
<A NAME="131"></A>committed against fathers and mothers and near relations, but not equally 
<A NAME="132"></A>unholy when there is no relationship. Moreover, they are much more likely 
<A NAME="133"></A>to occur if the relationship is unknown, and, when they have occurred, 
<A NAME="134"></A>the customary expiations of them cannot be made. Again, how strange it 
<A NAME="135"></A>is that Socrates, after having made the children common, should hinder 
<A NAME="136"></A>lovers from carnal intercourse only, but should permit love and familiarities 
<A NAME="137"></A>between father and son or between brother and brother, than which nothing 
<A NAME="138"></A>can be more unseemly, since even without them love of this sort is improper. 
<A NAME="139"></A>How strange, too, to forbid intercourse for no other reason than the violence 
<A NAME="140"></A>of the pleasure, as though the relationship of father and son or of brothers 
<A NAME="141"></A>with one another made no difference.
<A NAME="142"></A><BR><BR>This community of wives and children seems better suited to the 
<A NAME="143"></A>husbandmen than to the guardians, for if they have wives and children in 
<A NAME="144"></A>common, they will be bound to one another by weaker ties, as a subject 
<A NAME="145"></A>class should be, and they will remain obedient and not rebel. In a word, 
<A NAME="146"></A>the result of such a law would be just the opposite of which good laws 
<A NAME="147"></A>ought to have, and the intention of Socrates in making these regulations 
<A NAME="148"></A>about women and children would defeat itself. For friendship we believe 
<A NAME="149"></A>to be the greatest good of states and the preservative of them against 
<A NAME="150"></A>revolutions; neither is there anything which Socrates so greatly lauds 
<A NAME="151"></A>as the unity of the state which he and all the world declare to be created 
<A NAME="152"></A>by friendship. But the unity which he commends would be like that of the 
<A NAME="153"></A>lovers in the Symposium, who, as Aristophanes says, desire to grow together 
<A NAME="154"></A>in the excess of their affection, and from being two to become one, in 
<A NAME="155"></A>which case one or both would certainly perish. Whereas in a state having 
<A NAME="156"></A>women and children common, love will be watery; and the father will certainly 
<A NAME="157"></A>not say 'my son,' or the son 'my father.' As a little sweet wine mingled 
<A NAME="158"></A>with a great deal of water is imperceptible in the mixture, so, in this 
<A NAME="159"></A>sort of community, the idea of relationship which is based upon these names 
<A NAME="160"></A>will be lost; there is no reason why the so-called father should care about 
<A NAME="161"></A>the son, or the son about the father, or brothers about one another. Of 
<A NAME="162"></A>the two qualities which chiefly inspire regard and affection- that a thing 
<A NAME="163"></A>is your own and that it is your only one-neither can exist in such a state 
<A NAME="164"></A>as this.
<A NAME="165"></A><BR><BR>Again, the transfer of children as soon as they are born from the 
<A NAME="166"></A>rank of husbandmen or of artisans to that of guardians, and from the rank 
<A NAME="167"></A>of guardians into a lower rank, will be very difficult to arrange; the 
<A NAME="168"></A>givers or transferrers cannot but know whom they are giving and transferring, 
<A NAME="169"></A>and to whom. And the previously mentioned evils, such as assaults, unlawful 
<A NAME="170"></A>loves, homicides, will happen more often amongst those who are transferred 
<A NAME="171"></A>to the lower classes, or who have a place assigned to them among the guardians; 
<A NAME="172"></A>for they will no longer call the members of the class they have left brothers, 
<A NAME="173"></A>and children, and fathers, and mothers, and will not, therefore, be afraid 
<A NAME="174"></A>of committing any crimes by reason of consanguinity. Touching the community 
<A NAME="175"></A>of wives and children, let this be our conclusion.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="176"></A><B>Part V</B>

<A NAME="177"></A><BR><BR>Next let us consider what should be our arrangements about property: 
<A NAME="178"></A>should the citizens of the perfect state have their possessions in common 
<A NAME="179"></A>or not? This question may be discussed separately from the enactments about 
<A NAME="180"></A>women and children. Even supposing that the women and children belong to 
<A NAME="181"></A>individuals, according to the custom which is at present universal, may 
<A NAME="182"></A>there not be an advantage in having and using possessions in common? Three 
<A NAME="183"></A>cases are possible: (1) the soil may be appropriated, but the produce may 
<A NAME="184"></A>be thrown for consumption into the common stock; and this is the practice 
<A NAME="185"></A>of some nations. Or (2), the soil may be common, and may be cultivated 
<A NAME="186"></A>in common, but the produce divided among individuals for their private 
<A NAME="187"></A>use; this is a form of common property which is said to exist among certain 
<A NAME="188"></A>barbarians. Or (3), the soil and the produce may be alike 
<A NAME="189"></A>common.
<A NAME="190"></A><BR><BR>When the husbandmen are not the owners, the case will be different 
<A NAME="191"></A>and easier to deal with; but when they till the ground for themselves the 
<A NAME="192"></A>question of ownership will give a world of trouble. If they do not share 
<A NAME="193"></A>equally enjoyments and toils, those who labor much and get little will 
<A NAME="194"></A>necessarily complain of those who labor little and receive or consume much. 
<A NAME="195"></A>But indeed there is always a difficulty in men living together and having 
<A NAME="196"></A>all human relations in common, but especially in their having common property. 
<A NAME="197"></A>The partnerships of fellow-travelers are an example to the point; for they 
<A NAME="198"></A>generally fall out over everyday matters and quarrel about any trifle which 
<A NAME="199"></A>turns up. So with servants: we are most able to take offense at those with 
<A NAME="200"></A>whom we most we most frequently come into contact in daily 
<A NAME="201"></A>life.
<A NAME="202"></A><BR><BR>These are only some of the disadvantages which attend the community 
<A NAME="203"></A>of property; the present arrangement, if improved as it might be by good 
<A NAME="204"></A>customs and laws, would be far better, and would have the advantages of 
<A NAME="205"></A>both systems. Property should be in a certain sense common, but, as a general 
<A NAME="206"></A>rule, private; for, when everyone has a distinct interest, men will not 
<A NAME="207"></A>complain of one another, and they will make more progress, because every 
<A NAME="208"></A>one will be attending to his own business. And yet by reason of goodness, 
<A NAME="209"></A>and in respect of use, 'Friends,' as the proverb says, 'will have all things 
<A NAME="210"></A>common.' Even now there are traces of such a principle, showing that it 
<A NAME="211"></A>is not impracticable, but, in well-ordered states, exists already to a 
<A NAME="212"></A>certain extent and may be carried further. For, although every man has 
<A NAME="213"></A>his own property, some things he will place at the disposal of his friends, 
<A NAME="214"></A>while of others he shares the use with them. The Lacedaemonians, for example, 
<A NAME="215"></A>use one another's slaves, and horses, and dogs, as if they were their own; 
<A NAME="216"></A>and when they lack provisions on a journey, they appropriate what they 
<A NAME="217"></A>find in the fields throughout the country. It is clearly better that property 
<A NAME="218"></A>should be private, but the use of it common; and the special business of 
<A NAME="219"></A>the legislator is to create in men this benevolent disposition. Again, 
<A NAME="220"></A>how immeasurably greater is the pleasure, when a man feels a thing to be 
<A NAME="221"></A>his own; for surely the love of self is a feeling implanted by nature and 
<A NAME="222"></A>not given in vain, although selfishness is rightly censured; this, however, 
<A NAME="223"></A>is not the mere love of self, but the love of self in excess, like the 
<A NAME="224"></A>miser's love of money; for all, or almost all, men love money and other 
<A NAME="225"></A>such objects in a measure. And further, there is the greatest pleasure 
<A NAME="226"></A>in doing a kindness or service to friends or guests or companions, which 
<A NAME="227"></A>can only be rendered when a man has private property. These advantages 
<A NAME="228"></A>are lost by excessive unification of the state. The exhibition of two virtues, 
<A NAME="229"></A>besides, is visibly annihilated in such a state: first, temperance towards 
<A NAME="230"></A>women (for it is an honorable action to abstain from another's wife for 
<A NAME="231"></A>temperance' sake); secondly, liberality in the matter of property. No one, 
<A NAME="232"></A>when men have all things in common, will any longer set an example of liberality 
<A NAME="233"></A>or do any liberal action; for liberality consists in the use which is made 
<A NAME="234"></A>of property.
<A NAME="235"></A><BR><BR>Such legislation may have a specious appearance of benevolence; 
<A NAME="236"></A>men readily listen to it, and are easily induced to believe that in some 
<A NAME="237"></A>wonderful manner everybody will become everybody's friend, especially when 
<A NAME="238"></A>some one is heard denouncing the evils now existing in states, suits about 
<A NAME="239"></A>contracts, convictions for perjury, flatteries of rich men and the like, 
<A NAME="240"></A>which are said to arise out of the possession of private property. These 
<A NAME="241"></A>evils, however, are due to a very different cause- the wickedness of human 
<A NAME="242"></A>nature. Indeed, we see that there is much more quarrelling among those 
<A NAME="243"></A>who have all things in common, though there are not many of them when compared 
<A NAME="244"></A>with the vast numbers who have private property.
<A NAME="245"></A><BR><BR>Again, we ought to reckon, not only the evils from which the citizens 
<A NAME="246"></A>will be saved, but also the advantages which they will lose. The life which 
<A NAME="247"></A>they are to lead appears to be quite impracticable. The error of Socrates 
<A NAME="248"></A>must be attributed to the false notion of unity from which he starts. Unity 
<A NAME="249"></A>there should be, both of the family and of the state, but in some respects 
<A NAME="250"></A>only. For there is a point at which a state may attain such a degree of 
<A NAME="251"></A>unity as to be no longer a state, or at which, without actually ceasing 
<A NAME="252"></A>to exist, it will become an inferior state, like harmony passing into unison, 
<A NAME="253"></A>or rhythm which has been reduced to a single foot. The state, as I was 
<A NAME="254"></A>saying, is a plurality which should be united and made into a community 
<A NAME="255"></A>by education; and it is strange that the author of a system of education 
<A NAME="256"></A>which he thinks will make the state virtuous, should expect to improve 
<A NAME="257"></A>his citizens by regulations of this sort, and not by philosophy or by customs 
<A NAME="258"></A>and laws, like those which prevail at Sparta and Crete respecting common 
<A NAME="259"></A>meals, whereby the legislator has made property common. Let us remember 
<A NAME="260"></A>that we should not disregard the experience of ages; in the multitude of 
<A NAME="261"></A>years these things, if they were good, would certainly not have been unknown; 
<A NAME="262"></A>for almost everything has been found out, although sometimes they are not 
<A NAME="263"></A>put together; in other cases men do not use the knowledge which they have. 
<A NAME="264"></A>Great light would be thrown on this subject if we could see such a form 
<A NAME="265"></A>of government in the actual process of construction; for the legislator 
<A NAME="266"></A>could not form a state at all without distributing and dividing its constituents 
<A NAME="267"></A>into associations for common meals, and into phratries and tribes. But 
<A NAME="268"></A>all this legislation ends only in forbidding agriculture to the guardians, 
<A NAME="269"></A>a prohibition which the Lacedaemonians try to enforce 
<A NAME="270"></A>already.
<A NAME="271"></A><BR><BR>But, indeed, Socrates has not said, nor is it easy to decide, what 
<A NAME="272"></A>in such a community will be the general form of the state. The citizens 
<A NAME="273"></A>who are not guardians are the majority, and about them nothing has been 
<A NAME="274"></A>determined: are the husbandmen, too, to have their property in common? 
<A NAME="275"></A>Or is each individual to have his own? And are the wives and children to 
<A NAME="276"></A>be individual or common. If, like the guardians, they are to have all things 
<A NAME="277"></A>in common, what do they differ from them, or what will they gain by submitting 
<A NAME="278"></A>to their government? Or, upon what principle would they submit, unless 
<A NAME="279"></A>indeed the governing class adopt the ingenious policy of the Cretans, who 
<A NAME="280"></A>give their slaves the same institutions as their own, but forbid them gymnastic 
<A NAME="281"></A>exercises and the possession of arms. If, on the other hand, the inferior 
<A NAME="282"></A>classes are to be like other cities in respect of marriage and property, 
<A NAME="283"></A>what will be the form of the community? Must it not contain two states 
<A NAME="284"></A>in one, each hostile to the other He makes the guardians into a mere occupying 
<A NAME="285"></A>garrison, while the husbandmen and artisans and the rest are the real citizens. 
<A NAME="286"></A>But if so the suits and quarrels, and all the evils which Socrates affirms 
<A NAME="287"></A>to exist in other states, will exist equally among them. He says indeed 
<A NAME="288"></A>that, having so good an education, the citizens will not need many laws, 
<A NAME="289"></A>for example laws about the city or about the markets; but then he confines 
<A NAME="290"></A>his education to the guardians. Again, he makes the husbandmen owners of 
<A NAME="291"></A>the property upon condition of their paying a tribute. But in that case 
<A NAME="292"></A>they are likely to be much more unmanageable and conceited than the Helots, 
<A NAME="293"></A>or Penestae, or slaves in general. And whether community of wives and property 
<A NAME="294"></A>be necessary for the lower equally with the higher class or not, and the 
<A NAME="295"></A>questions akin to this, what will be the education, form of government, 
<A NAME="296"></A>laws of the lower class, Socrates has nowhere determined: neither is it 
<A NAME="297"></A>easy to discover this, nor is their character of small importance if the 
<A NAME="298"></A>common life of the guardians is to be maintained.
<A NAME="299"></A><BR><BR>Again, if Socrates makes the women common, and retains private 
<A NAME="300"></A>property, the men will see to the fields, but who will see to the house? 
<A NAME="301"></A>And who will do so if the agricultural class have both their property and 
<A NAME="302"></A>their wives in common? Once more: it is absurd to argue, from the analogy 
<A NAME="303"></A>of the animals, that men and women should follow the same pursuits, for 
<A NAME="304"></A>animals have not to manage a household. The government, too, as constituted 
<A NAME="305"></A>by Socrates, contains elements of danger; for he makes the same persons 
<A NAME="306"></A>always rule. And if this is often a cause of disturbance among the meaner 
<A NAME="307"></A>sort, how much more among high-spirited warriors? But that the persons 
<A NAME="308"></A>whom he makes rulers must be the same is evident; for the gold which the 
<A NAME="309"></A>God mingles in the souls of men is not at one time given to one, at another 
<A NAME="310"></A>time to another, but always to the same: as he says, 'God mingles gold 
<A NAME="311"></A>in some, and silver in others, from their very birth; but brass and iron 
<A NAME="312"></A>in those who are meant to be artisans and husbandmen.' Again, he deprives 
<A NAME="313"></A>the guardians even of happiness, and says that the legislator ought to 
<A NAME="314"></A>make the whole state happy. But the whole cannot be happy unless most, 
<A NAME="315"></A>or all, or some of its parts enjoy happiness. In this respect happiness 
<A NAME="316"></A>is not like the even principle in numbers, which may exist only in the 
<A NAME="317"></A>whole, but in neither of the parts; not so happiness. And if the guardians 
<A NAME="318"></A>are not happy, who are? Surely not the artisans, or the common people. 
<A NAME="319"></A>The Republic of which Socrates discourses has all these difficulties, and 
<A NAME="320"></A>others quite as great.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="321"></A><B>Part VI</B>

<A NAME="322"></A><BR><BR>The same, or nearly the same, objections apply to Plato's later 
<A NAME="323"></A>work, the Laws, and therefore we had better examine briefly the constitution 
<A NAME="324"></A>which is therein described. In the Republic, Socrates has definitely settled 
<A NAME="325"></A>in all a few questions only; such as the community of women and children, 
<A NAME="326"></A>the community of property, and the constitution of the state. The population 
<A NAME="327"></A>is divided into two classes- one of husbandmen, and the other of warriors; 
<A NAME="328"></A>from this latter is taken a third class of counselors and rulers of the 
<A NAME="329"></A>state. But Socrates has not determined whether the husbandmen and artisans 
<A NAME="330"></A>are to have a share in the government, and whether they, too, are to carry 
<A NAME="331"></A>arms and share in military service, or not. He certainly thinks that the 
<A NAME="332"></A>women ought to share in the education of the guardians, and to fight by 
<A NAME="333"></A>their side. The remainder of the work is filled up with digressions foreign 
<A NAME="334"></A>to the main subject, and with discussions about the education of the guardians. 
<A NAME="335"></A>In the Laws there is hardly anything but laws; not much is said about the 
<A NAME="336"></A>constitution. This, which he had intended to make more of the ordinary 
<A NAME="337"></A>type, he gradually brings round to the other or ideal form. For with the 
<A NAME="338"></A>exception of the community of women and property, he supposes everything 
<A NAME="339"></A>to be the same in both states; there is to be the same education; the citizens 
<A NAME="340"></A>of both are to live free from servile occupations, and there are to be 
<A NAME="341"></A>common meals in both. The only difference is that in the Laws, the common 
<A NAME="342"></A>meals are extended to women, and the warriors number 5000, but in the Republic 
<A NAME="343"></A>only 1000.
<A NAME="344"></A><BR><BR>The discourses of Socrates are never commonplace; they always exhibit 
<A NAME="345"></A>grace and originality and thought; but perfection in everything can hardly 
<A NAME="346"></A>be expected. We must not overlook the fact that the number of 5000 citizens, 
<A NAME="347"></A>just now mentioned, will require a territory as large as Babylon, or some 
<A NAME="348"></A>other huge site, if so many persons are to be supported in idleness, together 
<A NAME="349"></A>with their women and attendants, who will be a multitude many times as 
<A NAME="350"></A>great. In framing an ideal we may assume what we wish, but should avoid 
<A NAME="351"></A>impossibilities.
<A NAME="352"></A><BR><BR>It is said that the legislator ought to have his eye directed to 
<A NAME="353"></A>two points- the people and the country. But neighboring countries also 
<A NAME="354"></A>must not be forgotten by him, firstly because the state for which he legislates 
<A NAME="355"></A>is to have a political and not an isolated life. For a state must have 
<A NAME="356"></A>such a military force as will be serviceable against her neighbors, and 
<A NAME="357"></A>not merely useful at home. Even if the life of action is not admitted to 
<A NAME="358"></A>be the best, either for individuals or states, still a city should be formidable 
<A NAME="359"></A>to enemies, whether invading or retreating.
<A NAME="360"></A><BR><BR>There is another point: Should not the amount of property be defined 
<A NAME="361"></A>in some way which differs from this by being clearer? For Socrates says 
<A NAME="362"></A>that a man should have so much property as will enable him to live temperately, 
<A NAME="363"></A>which is only a way of saying 'to live well'; this is too general a conception. 
<A NAME="364"></A>Further, a man may live temperately and yet miserably. A better definition 
<A NAME="365"></A>would be that a man must have so much property as will enable him to live 
<A NAME="366"></A>not only temperately but liberally; if the two are parted, liberally will 
<A NAME="367"></A>combine with luxury; temperance will be associated with toil. For liberality 
<A NAME="368"></A>and temperance are the only eligible qualities which have to do with the 
<A NAME="369"></A>use of property. A man cannot use property with mildness or courage, but 
<A NAME="370"></A>temperately and liberally he may; and therefore the practice of these virtues 
<A NAME="371"></A>is inseparable from property. There is an inconsistency, too, in too, in 
<A NAME="372"></A>equalizing the property and not regulating the number of the citizens; 
<A NAME="373"></A>the population is to remain unlimited, and he thinks that it will be sufficiently 
<A NAME="374"></A>equalized by a certain number of marriages being unfruitful, however many 
<A NAME="375"></A>are born to others, because he finds this to be the case in existing states. 
<A NAME="376"></A>But greater care will be required than now; for among ourselves, whatever 
<A NAME="377"></A>may be the number of citizens, the property is always distributed among 
<A NAME="378"></A>them, and therefore no one is in want; but, if the property were incapable 
<A NAME="379"></A>of division as in the Laws, the supernumeraries, whether few or many, would 
<A NAME="380"></A>get nothing. One would have thought that it was even more necessary to 
<A NAME="381"></A>limit population than property; and that the limit should be fixed by calculating 
<A NAME="382"></A>the chances of mortality in the children, and of sterility in married persons. 
<A NAME="383"></A>The neglect of this subject, which in existing states is so common, is 
<A NAME="384"></A>a never-failing cause of poverty among the citizens; and poverty is the 
<A NAME="385"></A>parent of revolution and crime. Pheidon the Corinthian, who was one of 
<A NAME="386"></A>the most ardent legislators, thought that the families and the number of 
<A NAME="387"></A>citizens ought to remain the same, although originally all the lots may 
<A NAME="388"></A>have been of different sizes: but in the Laws the opposite principle is 
<A NAME="389"></A>maintained. What in our opinion is the right arrangement will have to be 
<A NAME="390"></A>explained hereafter.
<A NAME="391"></A><BR><BR>There is another omission in the Laws: Socrates does not tell us 
<A NAME="392"></A>how the rulers differ from their subjects; he only says that they should 
<A NAME="393"></A>be related as the warp and the woof, which are made out of different wools. 
<A NAME="394"></A>He allows that a man's whole property may be increased fivefold, but why 
<A NAME="395"></A>should not his land also increase to a certain extent? Again, will the 
<A NAME="396"></A>good management of a household be promoted by his arrangement of homesteads? 
<A NAME="397"></A>For he assigns to each individual two homesteads in separate places, and 
<A NAME="398"></A>it is difficult to live in two houses.
<A NAME="399"></A><BR><BR>The whole system of government tends to be neither democracy nor 
<A NAME="400"></A>oligarchy, but something in a mean between them, which is usually called 
<A NAME="401"></A>a polity, and is composed of the heavy-armed soldiers. Now, if he intended 
<A NAME="402"></A>to frame a constitution which would suit the greatest number of states, 
<A NAME="403"></A>he was very likely right, but not if he meant to say that this constitutional 
<A NAME="404"></A>form came nearest to his first or ideal state; for many would prefer the 
<A NAME="405"></A>Lacedaemonian, or, possibly, some other more aristocratic government. Some, 
<A NAME="406"></A>indeed, say that the best constitution is a combination of all existing 
<A NAME="407"></A>forms, and they praise the Lacedaemonian because it is made up of oligarchy, 
<A NAME="408"></A>monarchy, and democracy, the king forming the monarchy, and the council 
<A NAME="409"></A>of elders the oligarchy while the democratic element is represented by 
<A NAME="410"></A>the Ephors; for the Ephors are selected from the people. Others, however, 
<A NAME="411"></A>declare the Ephoralty to be a tyranny, and find the element of democracy 
<A NAME="412"></A>in the common meals and in the habits of daily life. In the Laws it is 
<A NAME="413"></A>maintained that the best constitution is made up of democracy and tyranny, 
<A NAME="414"></A>which are either not constitutions at all, or are the worst of all. But 
<A NAME="415"></A>they are nearer the truth who combine many forms; for the constitution 
<A NAME="416"></A>is better which is made up of more numerous elements. The constitution 
<A NAME="417"></A>proposed in the Laws has no element of monarchy at all; it is nothing but 
<A NAME="418"></A>oligarchy and democracy, leaning rather to oligarchy. This is seen in the 
<A NAME="419"></A>mode of appointing magistrates; for although the appointment of them by 
<A NAME="420"></A>lot from among those who have been already selected combines both elements, 
<A NAME="421"></A>the way in which the rich are compelled by law to attend the assembly and 
<A NAME="422"></A>vote for magistrates or discharge other political duties, while the rest 
<A NAME="423"></A>may do as they like, and the endeavor to have the greater number of the 
<A NAME="424"></A>magistrates appointed out of the richer classes and the highest officers 
<A NAME="425"></A>selected from those who have the greatest incomes, both these are oligarchical 
<A NAME="426"></A>features. The oligarchical principle prevails also in the choice of the 
<A NAME="427"></A>council, for all are compelled to choose, but the compulsion extends only 
<A NAME="428"></A>to the choice out of the first class, and of an equal number out of the 
<A NAME="429"></A>second class and out of the third class, but not in this latter case to 
<A NAME="430"></A>all the voters but to those of the first three classes; and the selection 
<A NAME="431"></A>of candidates out of the fourth class is only compulsory on the first and 
<A NAME="432"></A>second. Then, from the persons so chosen, he says that there ought to be 
<A NAME="433"></A>an equal number of each class selected. Thus a preponderance will be given 
<A NAME="434"></A>to the better sort of people, who have the larger incomes, because many 
<A NAME="435"></A>of the lower classes, not being compelled will not vote. These considerations, 
<A NAME="436"></A>and others which will be adduced when the time comes for examining similar 
<A NAME="437"></A>polities, tend to show that states like Plato's should not be composed 
<A NAME="438"></A>of democracy and monarchy. There is also a danger in electing the magistrates 
<A NAME="439"></A>out of a body who are themselves elected; for, if but a small number choose 
<A NAME="440"></A>to combine, the elections will always go as they desire. Such is the constitution 
<A NAME="441"></A>which is described in the Laws.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="442"></A><B>Part VII</B>

<A NAME="443"></A><BR><BR>Other constitutions have been proposed; some by private persons, 
<A NAME="444"></A>others by philosophers and statesmen, which all come nearer to established 
<A NAME="445"></A>or existing ones than either of Plato's. No one else has introduced such 
<A NAME="446"></A>novelties as the community of women and children, or public tables for 
<A NAME="447"></A>women: other legislators begin with what is necessary. In the opinion of 
<A NAME="448"></A>some, the regulation of property is the chief point of all, that being 
<A NAME="449"></A>the question upon which all revolutions turn. This danger was recognized 
<A NAME="450"></A>by Phaleas of Chalcedon, who was the first to affirm that the citizens 
<A NAME="451"></A>of a state ought to have equal possessions. He thought that in a new colony 
<A NAME="452"></A>the equalization might be accomplished without difficulty, not so easily 
<A NAME="453"></A>when a state was already established; and that then the shortest way of 
<A NAME="454"></A>compassing the desired end would be for the rich to give and not to receive 
<A NAME="455"></A>marriage portions, and for the poor not to give but to receive 
<A NAME="456"></A>them.
<A NAME="457"></A><BR><BR>Plato in the Laws was of opinion that, to a certain extent, accumulation 
<A NAME="458"></A>should be allowed, forbidding, as I have already observed, any citizen 
<A NAME="459"></A>to possess more than five times the minimum qualification But those who 
<A NAME="460"></A>make such laws should remember what they are apt to forget- that the legislator 
<A NAME="461"></A>who fixes the amount of property should also fix the number of children; 
<A NAME="462"></A>for, if the children are too many for the property, the law must be broken. 
<A NAME="463"></A>And, besides the violation of the law, it is a bad thing that many from 
<A NAME="464"></A>being rich should become poor; for men of ruined fortunes are sure to stir 
<A NAME="465"></A>up revolutions. That the equalization of property exercises an influence 
<A NAME="466"></A>on political society was clearly understood even by some of the old legislators. 
<A NAME="467"></A>Laws were made by Solon and others prohibiting an individual from possessing 
<A NAME="468"></A>as much land as he pleased; and there are other laws in states which forbid 
<A NAME="469"></A>the sale of property: among the Locrians, for example, there is a law that 
<A NAME="470"></A>a man is not to sell his property unless he can prove unmistakably that 
<A NAME="471"></A>some misfortune has befallen him. Again, there have been laws which enjoin 
<A NAME="472"></A>the preservation of the original lots. Such a law existed in the island 
<A NAME="473"></A>of Leucas, and the abrogation of it made the constitution too democratic, 
<A NAME="474"></A>for the rulers no longer had the prescribed qualification. Again, where 
<A NAME="475"></A>there is equality of property, the amount may be either too large or too 
<A NAME="476"></A>small, and the possessor may be living either in luxury or penury. Clearly, 
<A NAME="477"></A>then, the legislator ought not only to aim at the equalization of properties, 
<A NAME="478"></A>but at moderation in their amount. Further, if he prescribe this moderate 
<A NAME="479"></A>amount equally to all, he will be no nearer the mark; for it is not the 
<A NAME="480"></A>possessions but the desires of mankind which require to be equalized, and 
<A NAME="481"></A>this is impossible, unless a sufficient education is provided by the laws. 
<A NAME="482"></A>But Phaleas will probably reply that this is precisely what he means; and 
<A NAME="483"></A>that, in his opinion, there ought to be in states, not only equal property, 
<A NAME="484"></A>but equal education. Still he should tell precisely what he means; and 
<A NAME="485"></A>that, in his opinion, there ought to be in be in having one and the same 
<A NAME="486"></A>for all, if it is of a sort that predisposes men to avarice, or ambition, 
<A NAME="487"></A>or both. Moreover, civil troubles arise, not only out of the inequality 
<A NAME="488"></A>of property, but out of the inequality of honor, though in opposite ways. 
<A NAME="489"></A>For the common people quarrel about the inequality of property, the higher 
<A NAME="490"></A>class about the equality of honor; as the poet says, <BR><BR>"The bad and 
<A NAME="491"></A>good alike in honor share. "<BR><BR>

<A NAME="492"></A><BR><BR>There are crimes of which the motive is want; and for these Phaleas 
<A NAME="493"></A>expects to find a cure in the equalization of property, which will take 
<A NAME="494"></A>away from a man the temptation to be a highwayman, because he is hungry 
<A NAME="495"></A>or cold. But want is not the sole incentive to crime; men also wish to 
<A NAME="496"></A>enjoy themselves and not to be in a state of desire- they wish to cure 
<A NAME="497"></A>some desire, going beyond the necessities of life, which preys upon them; 
<A NAME="498"></A>nay, this is not the only reason- they may desire superfluities in order 
<A NAME="499"></A>to enjoy pleasures unaccompanied with pain, and therefore they commit 
<A NAME="500"></A>crimes.
<A NAME="501"></A><BR><BR>Now what is the cure of these three disorders? Of the first, moderate 
<A NAME="502"></A>possessions and occupation; of the second, habits of temperance; as to 
<A NAME="503"></A>the third, if any desire pleasures which depend on themselves, they will 
<A NAME="504"></A>find the satisfaction of their desires nowhere but in philosophy; for all 
<A NAME="505"></A>other pleasures we are dependent on others. The fact is that the greatest 
<A NAME="506"></A>crimes are caused by excess and not by necessity. Men do not become tyrants 
<A NAME="507"></A>in order that they may not suffer cold; and hence great is the honor bestowed, 
<A NAME="508"></A>not on him who kills a thief, but on him who kills a tyrant. Thus we see 
<A NAME="509"></A>that the institutions of Phaleas avail only against petty 
<A NAME="510"></A>crimes.
<A NAME="511"></A><BR><BR>There is another objection to them. They are chiefly designed to 
<A NAME="512"></A>promote the internal welfare of the state. But the legislator should consider 
<A NAME="513"></A>also its relation to neighboring nations, and to all who are outside of 
<A NAME="514"></A>it. The government must be organized with a view to military strength; 
<A NAME="515"></A>and of this he has said not a word. And so with respect to property: there 
<A NAME="516"></A>should not only be enough to supply the internal wants of the state, but 
<A NAME="517"></A>also to meet dangers coming from without. The property of the state should 
<A NAME="518"></A>not be so large that more powerful neighbors may be tempted by it, while 
<A NAME="519"></A>the owners are unable to repel the invaders; nor yet so small that the 
<A NAME="520"></A>state is unable to maintain a war even against states of equal power, and 
<A NAME="521"></A>of the same character. Phaleas has not laid down any rule; but we should 
<A NAME="522"></A>bear in mind that abundance of wealth is an advantage. The best limit will 
<A NAME="523"></A>probably be, that a more powerful neighbor must have no inducement to go 
<A NAME="524"></A>to war with you by reason of the excess of your wealth, but only such as 
<A NAME="525"></A>he would have had if you had possessed less. There is a story that Eubulus, 
<A NAME="526"></A>when Autophradates was going to besiege Atarneus, told him to consider 
<A NAME="527"></A>how long the operation would take, and then reckon up the cost which would 
<A NAME="528"></A>be incurred in the time. 'For,' said he, 'I am willing for a smaller sum 
<A NAME="529"></A>than that to leave Atarneus at once.' These words of Eubulus made an impression 
<A NAME="530"></A>on Autophradates, and he desisted from the siege.
<A NAME="531"></A><BR><BR>The equalization of property is one of the things that tend to 
<A NAME="532"></A>prevent the citizens from quarrelling. Not that the gain in this direction 
<A NAME="533"></A>is very great. For the nobles will be dissatisfied because they think themselves 
<A NAME="534"></A>worthy of more than an equal share of honors; and this is often found to 
<A NAME="535"></A>be a cause of sedition and revolution. And the avarice of mankind is insatiable; 
<A NAME="536"></A>at one time two obols was pay enough; but now, when this sum has become 
<A NAME="537"></A>customary, men always want more and more without end; for it is of the 
<A NAME="538"></A>nature of desire not to be satisfied, and most men live only for the gratification 
<A NAME="539"></A>of it. The beginning of reform is not so much to equalize property as to 
<A NAME="540"></A>train the nobler sort of natures not to desire more, and to prevent the 
<A NAME="541"></A>lower from getting more; that is to say, they must be kept down, but not 
<A NAME="542"></A>ill-treated. Besides, the equalization proposed by Phaleas is imperfect; 
<A NAME="543"></A>for he only equalizes land, whereas a man may be rich also in slaves, and 
<A NAME="544"></A>cattle, and money, and in the abundance of what are called his movables. 
<A NAME="545"></A>Now either all these things must be equalized, or some limit must be imposed 
<A NAME="546"></A>on them, or they must an be let alone. It would appear that Phaleas is 
<A NAME="547"></A>legislating for a small city only, if, as he supposes, all the artisans 
<A NAME="548"></A>are to be public slaves and not to form a supplementary part of the body 
<A NAME="549"></A>of citizens. But if there is a law that artisans are to be public slaves, 
<A NAME="550"></A>it should only apply to those engaged on public works, as at Epidamnus, 
<A NAME="551"></A>or at Athens on the plan which Diophantus once introduced.
<A NAME="552"></A><BR><BR>From these observations any one may judge how far Phaleas was wrong 
<A NAME="553"></A>or right in his ideas.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="554"></A><B>Part VIII</B>

<A NAME="555"></A><BR><BR>Hippodamus, the son of Euryphon, a native of Miletus, the same 
<A NAME="556"></A>who invented the art of planning cities, and who also laid out the Piraeus- 
<A NAME="557"></A>a strange man, whose fondness for distinction led him into a general eccentricity 
<A NAME="558"></A>of life, which made some think him affected (for he would wear flowing 
<A NAME="559"></A>hair and expensive ornaments; but these were worn on a cheap but warm garment 
<A NAME="560"></A>both in winter and summer); he, besides aspiring to be an adept in the 
<A NAME="561"></A>knowledge of nature, was the first person not a statesman who made inquiries 
<A NAME="562"></A>about the best form of government.
<A NAME="563"></A><BR><BR>The city of Hippodamus was composed of 10,000 citizens divided 
<A NAME="564"></A>into three parts- one of artisans, one of husbandmen, and a third of armed 
<A NAME="565"></A>defenders of the state. He also divided the land into three parts, one 
<A NAME="566"></A>sacred, one public, the third private: the first was set apart to maintain 
<A NAME="567"></A>the customary worship of the Gods, the second was to support the warriors, 
<A NAME="568"></A>the third was the property of the husbandmen. He also divided laws into 
<A NAME="569"></A>three classes, and no more, for he maintained that there are three subjects 
<A NAME="570"></A>of lawsuits- insult, injury, and homicide. He likewise instituted a single 
<A NAME="571"></A>final court of appeal, to which all causes seeming to have been improperly 
<A NAME="572"></A>decided might be referred; this court he formed of elders chosen for the 
<A NAME="573"></A>purpose. He was further of opinion that the decisions of the courts ought 
<A NAME="574"></A>not to be given by the use of a voting pebble, but that every one should 
<A NAME="575"></A>have a tablet on which he might not only write a simple condemnation, or 
<A NAME="576"></A>leave the tablet blank for a simple acquittal; but, if he partly acquitted 
<A NAME="577"></A>and partly condemned, he was to distinguish accordingly. To the existing 
<A NAME="578"></A>law he objected that it obliged the judges to be guilty of perjury, whichever 
<A NAME="579"></A>way they voted. He also enacted that those who discovered anything for 
<A NAME="580"></A>the good of the state should be honored; and he provided that the children 
<A NAME="581"></A>of citizens who died in battle should be maintained at the public expense, 
<A NAME="582"></A>as if such an enactment had never been heard of before, yet it actually 
<A NAME="583"></A>exists at Athens and in other places. As to the magistrates, he would have 
<A NAME="584"></A>them all elected by the people, that is, by the three classes already mentioned, 
<A NAME="585"></A>and those who were elected were to watch over the interests of the public, 
<A NAME="586"></A>of strangers, and of orphans. These are the most striking points in the 
<A NAME="587"></A>constitution of Hippodamus. There is not much else.
<A NAME="588"></A><BR><BR>The first of these proposals to which objection may be taken is 
<A NAME="589"></A>the threefold division of the citizens. The artisans, and the husbandmen, 
<A NAME="590"></A>and the warriors, all have a share in the government. But the husbandmen 
<A NAME="591"></A>have no arms, and the artisans neither arms nor land, and therefore they 
<A NAME="592"></A>become all but slaves of the warrior class. That they should share in all 
<A NAME="593"></A>the offices is an impossibility; for generals and guardians of the citizens, 
<A NAME="594"></A>and nearly all the principal magistrates, must be taken from the class 
<A NAME="595"></A>of those who carry arms. Yet, if the two other classes have no share in 
<A NAME="596"></A>the government, how can they be loyal citizens? It may be said that those 
<A NAME="597"></A>who have arms must necessarily be masters of both the other classes, but 
<A NAME="598"></A>this is not so easily accomplished unless they are numerous; and if they 
<A NAME="599"></A>are, why should the other classes share in the government at all, or have 
<A NAME="600"></A>power to appoint magistrates? Further, what use are farmers to the city? 
<A NAME="601"></A>Artisans there must be, for these are wanted in every city, and they can 
<A NAME="602"></A>live by their craft, as elsewhere; and the husbandmen too, if they really 
<A NAME="603"></A>provided the warriors with food, might fairly have a share in the government. 
<A NAME="604"></A>But in the republic of Hippodamus they are supposed to have land of their 
<A NAME="605"></A>own, which they cultivate for their private benefit. Again, as to this 
<A NAME="606"></A>common land out of which the soldiers are maintained, if they are themselves 
<A NAME="607"></A>to be the cultivators of it, the warrior class will be identical with the 
<A NAME="608"></A>husbandmen, although the legislator intended to make a distinction between 
<A NAME="609"></A>them. If, again, there are to be other cultivators distinct both from the 
<A NAME="610"></A>husbandmen, who have land of their own, and from the warriors, they will 
<A NAME="611"></A>make a fourth class, which has no place in the state and no share in anything. 
<A NAME="612"></A>Or, if the same persons are to cultivate their own lands, and those of 
<A NAME="613"></A>the public as well, they will have difficulty in supplying the quantity 
<A NAME="614"></A>of produce which will maintain two households: and why, in this case, should 
<A NAME="615"></A>there be any division, for they might find food themselves and give to 
<A NAME="616"></A>the warriors from the same land and the same lots? There is surely a great 
<A NAME="617"></A>confusion in all this.
<A NAME="618"></A><BR><BR>Neither is the law to commended which says that the judges, when 
<A NAME="619"></A>a simple issue is laid before them, should distinguish in their judgement; 
<A NAME="620"></A>for the judge is thus converted into an arbitrator. Now, in an arbitration, 
<A NAME="621"></A>although the arbitrators are many, they confer with one another about the 
<A NAME="622"></A>decision, and therefore they can distinguish; but in courts of law this 
<A NAME="623"></A>is impossible, and, indeed, most legislators take pains to prevent the 
<A NAME="624"></A>judges from holding any communication with one another. Again, will there 
<A NAME="625"></A>not be confusion if the judge thinks that damages should be given, but 
<A NAME="626"></A>not so much as the suitor demands? He asks, say, for twenty minae, and 
<A NAME="627"></A>the judge allows him ten minae (or in general the suitor asks for more 
<A NAME="628"></A>and the judge allows less), while another judge allows five, another four 
<A NAME="629"></A>minae. In this way they will go on splitting up the damages, and some will 
<A NAME="630"></A>grant the whole and others nothing: how is the final reckoning to be taken? 
<A NAME="631"></A>Again, no one contends that he who votes for a simple acquittal or condemnation 
<A NAME="632"></A>perjures himself, if the indictment has been laid in an unqualified form; 
<A NAME="633"></A>and this is just, for the judge who acquits does not decide that the defendant 
<A NAME="634"></A>owes nothing, but that he does not owe the twenty minae. He only is guilty 
<A NAME="635"></A>of perjury who thinks that the defendant ought not to pay twenty minae, 
<A NAME="636"></A>and yet condemns him.
<A NAME="637"></A><BR><BR>To honor those who discover anything which is useful to the state 
<A NAME="638"></A>is a proposal which has a specious sound, but cannot safely be enacted 
<A NAME="639"></A>by law, for it may encourage informers, and perhaps even lead to political 
<A NAME="640"></A>commotions. This question involves another. It has been doubted whether 
<A NAME="641"></A>it is or is not expedient to make any changes in the laws of a country, 
<A NAME="642"></A>even if another law be better. Now, if an changes are inexpedient, we can 
<A NAME="643"></A>hardly assent to the proposal of Hippodamus; for, under pretense of doing 
<A NAME="644"></A>a public service, a man may introduce measures which are really destructive 
<A NAME="645"></A>to the laws or to the constitution. But, since we have touched upon this 
<A NAME="646"></A>subject, perhaps we had better go a little into detail, for, as I was saying, 
<A NAME="647"></A>there is a difference of opinion, and it may sometimes seem desirable to 
<A NAME="648"></A>make changes. Such changes in the other arts and sciences have certainly 
<A NAME="649"></A>been beneficial; medicine, for example, and gymnastic, and every other 
<A NAME="650"></A>art and craft have departed from traditional usage. And, if politics be 
<A NAME="651"></A>an art, change must be necessary in this as in any other art. That improvement 
<A NAME="652"></A>has occurred is shown by the fact that old customs are exceedingly simple 
<A NAME="653"></A>and barbarous. For the ancient Hellenes went about armed and bought their 
<A NAME="654"></A>brides of each other. The remains of ancient laws which have come down 
<A NAME="655"></A>to us are quite absurd; for example, at Cumae there is a law about murder, 
<A NAME="656"></A>to the effect that if the accuser produce a certain number of witnesses 
<A NAME="657"></A>from among his own kinsmen, the accused shall be held guilty. Again, men 
<A NAME="658"></A>in general desire the good, and not merely what their fathers had. But 
<A NAME="659"></A>the primeval inhabitants, whether they were born of the earth or were the 
<A NAME="660"></A>survivors of some destruction, may be supposed to have been no better than 
<A NAME="661"></A>ordinary or even foolish people among ourselves (such is certainly the 
<A NAME="662"></A>tradition concerning the earth-born men); and it would be ridiculous to 
<A NAME="663"></A>rest contented with their notions. Even when laws have been written down, 
<A NAME="664"></A>they ought not always to remain unaltered. As in other sciences, so in 
<A NAME="665"></A>politics, it is impossible that all things should be precisely set down 
<A NAME="666"></A>in writing; for enactments must be universal, but actions are concerned 
<A NAME="667"></A>with particulars. Hence we infer that sometimes and in certain cases laws 
<A NAME="668"></A>may be changed; but when we look at the matter from another point of view, 
<A NAME="669"></A>great caution would seem to be required. For the habit of lightly changing 
<A NAME="670"></A>the laws is an evil, and, when the advantage is small, some errors both 
<A NAME="671"></A>of lawgivers and rulers had better be left; the citizen will not gain so 
<A NAME="672"></A>much by making the change as he will lose by the habit of disobedience. 
<A NAME="673"></A>The analogy of the arts is false; a change in a law is a very different 
<A NAME="674"></A>thing from a change in an art. For the law has no power to command obedience 
<A NAME="675"></A>except that of habit, which can only be given by time, so that a readiness 
<A NAME="676"></A>to change from old to new laws enfeebles the power of the law. Even if 
<A NAME="677"></A>we admit that the laws are to be changed, are they all to be changed, and 
<A NAME="678"></A>in every state? And are they to be changed by anybody who likes, or only 
<A NAME="679"></A>by certain persons? These are very important questions; and therefore we 
<A NAME="680"></A>had better reserve the discussion of them to a more suitable 
<A NAME="681"></A>occasion.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="682"></A><B>Part IX</B>

<A NAME="683"></A><BR><BR>In the governments of Lacedaemon and Crete, and indeed in all governments, 
<A NAME="684"></A>two points have to be considered: first, whether any particular law is 
<A NAME="685"></A>good or bad, when compared with the perfect state; secondly, whether it 
<A NAME="686"></A>is or is not consistent with the idea and character which the lawgiver 
<A NAME="687"></A>has set before his citizens. That in a well-ordered state the citizens 
<A NAME="688"></A>should have leisure and not have to provide for their daily wants is generally 
<A NAME="689"></A>acknowledged, but there is a difficulty in seeing how this leisure is to 
<A NAME="690"></A>be attained. The Thessalian Penestae have often risen against their masters, 
<A NAME="691"></A>and the Helots in like manner against the Lacedaemonians, for whose misfortunes 
<A NAME="692"></A>they are always lying in wait. Nothing, however, of this kind has as yet 
<A NAME="693"></A>happened to the Cretans; the reason probably is that the neighboring cities, 
<A NAME="694"></A>even when at war with one another, never form an alliance with rebellious 
<A NAME="695"></A>serfs, rebellions not being for their interest, since they themselves have 
<A NAME="696"></A>a dependent population. Whereas all the neighbors of the Lacedaemonians, 
<A NAME="697"></A>whether Argives, Messenians, or Arcadians, were their enemies. In Thessaly, 
<A NAME="698"></A>again, the original revolt of the slaves occurred because the Thessalians 
<A NAME="699"></A>were still at war with the neighboring Achaeans, Perrhaebians, and Magnesians. 
<A NAME="700"></A>Besides, if there were no other difficulty, the treatment or management 
<A NAME="701"></A>of slaves is a troublesome affair; for, if not kept in hand, they are insolent, 
<A NAME="702"></A>and think that they are as good as their masters, and, if harshly treated, 
<A NAME="703"></A>they hate and conspire against them. Now it is clear that when these are 
<A NAME="704"></A>the results the citizens of a state have not found out the secret of managing 
<A NAME="705"></A>their subject population.
<A NAME="706"></A><BR><BR>Again, the license of the Lacedaemonian women defeats the intention 
<A NAME="707"></A>of the Spartan constitution, and is adverse to the happiness of the state. 
<A NAME="708"></A>For, a husband and wife being each a part of every family, the state may 
<A NAME="709"></A>be considered as about equally divided into men and women; and, therefore, 
<A NAME="710"></A>in those states in which the condition of the women is bad, half the city 
<A NAME="711"></A>may be regarded as having no laws. And this is what has actually happened 
<A NAME="712"></A>at Sparta; the legislator wanted to make the whole state hardy and temperate, 
<A NAME="713"></A>and he has carried out his intention in the case of the men, but he has 
<A NAME="714"></A>neglected the women, who live in every sort of intemperance and luxury. 
<A NAME="715"></A>The consequence is that in such a state wealth is too highly valued, especially 
<A NAME="716"></A>if the citizen fall under the dominion of their wives, after the manner 
<A NAME="717"></A>of most warlike races, except the Celts and a few others who openly approve 
<A NAME="718"></A>of male loves. The old mythologer would seem to have been right in uniting 
<A NAME="719"></A>Ares and Aphrodite, for all warlike races are prone to the love either 
<A NAME="720"></A>of men or of women. This was exemplified among the Spartans in the days 
<A NAME="721"></A>of their greatness; many things were managed by their women. But what difference 
<A NAME="722"></A>does it make whether women rule, or the rulers are ruled by women? The 
<A NAME="723"></A>result is the same. Even in regard to courage, which is of no use in daily 
<A NAME="724"></A>life, and is needed only in war, the influence of the Lacedaemonian women 
<A NAME="725"></A>has been most mischievous. The evil showed itself in the Theban invasion, 
<A NAME="726"></A>when, unlike the women other cities, they were utterly useless and caused 
<A NAME="727"></A>more confusion than the enemy. This license of the Lacedaemonian women 
<A NAME="728"></A>existed from the earliest times, and was only what might be expected. For, 
<A NAME="729"></A>during the wars of the Lacedaemonians, first against the Argives, and afterwards 
<A NAME="730"></A>against the Arcadians and Messenians, the men were long away from home, 
<A NAME="731"></A>and, on the return of peace, they gave themselves into the legislator's 
<A NAME="732"></A>hand, already prepared by the discipline of a soldier's life (in which 
<A NAME="733"></A>there are many elements of virtue), to receive his enactments. But, when 
<A NAME="734"></A>Lycurgus, as tradition says, wanted to bring the women under his laws, 
<A NAME="735"></A>they resisted, and he gave up the attempt. These then are the causes of 
<A NAME="736"></A>what then happened, and this defect in the constitution is clearly to be 
<A NAME="737"></A>attributed to them. We are not, however, considering what is or is not 
<A NAME="738"></A>to be excused, but what is right or wrong, and the disorder of the women, 
<A NAME="739"></A>as I have already said, not only gives an air of indecorum to the constitution 
<A NAME="740"></A>considered in itself, but tends in a measure to foster 
<A NAME="741"></A>avarice.
<A NAME="742"></A><BR><BR>The mention of avarice naturally suggests a criticism on the inequality 
<A NAME="743"></A>of property. While some of the Spartan citizen have quite small properties, 
<A NAME="744"></A>others have very large ones; hence the land has passed into the hands of 
<A NAME="745"></A>a few. And this is due also to faulty laws; for, although the legislator 
<A NAME="746"></A>rightly holds up to shame the sale or purchase of an inheritance, he allows 
<A NAME="747"></A>anybody who likes to give or bequeath it. Yet both practices lead to the 
<A NAME="748"></A>same result. And nearly two-fifths of the whole country are held by women; 
<A NAME="749"></A>this is owing to the number of heiresses and to the large dowries which 
<A NAME="750"></A>are customary. It would surely have been better to have given no dowries 
<A NAME="751"></A>at all, or, if any, but small or moderate ones. As the law now stands, 
<A NAME="752"></A>a man may bestow his heiress on any one whom he pleases, and, if he die 
<A NAME="753"></A>intestate, the privilege of giving her away descends to his heir. Hence, 
<A NAME="754"></A>although the country is able to maintain 1500 cavalry and 30,000 hoplites, 
<A NAME="755"></A>the whole number of Spartan citizens fell below 1000. The result proves 
<A NAME="756"></A>the faulty nature of their laws respecting property; for the city sank 
<A NAME="757"></A>under a single defeat; the want of men was their ruin. There is a tradition 
<A NAME="758"></A>that, in the days of their ancient kings, they were in the habit of giving 
<A NAME="759"></A>the rights of citizenship to strangers, and therefore, in spite of their 
<A NAME="760"></A>long wars, no lack of population was experienced by them; indeed, at one 
<A NAME="761"></A>time Sparta is said to have numbered not less than 10,000 citizens Whether 
<A NAME="762"></A>this statement is true or not, it would certainly have been better to have 
<A NAME="763"></A>maintained their numbers by the equalization of property. Again, the law 
<A NAME="764"></A>which relates to the procreation of children is adverse to the correction 
<A NAME="765"></A>of this inequality. For the legislator, wanting to have as many Spartans 
<A NAME="766"></A>as he could, encouraged the citizens to have large families; and there 
<A NAME="767"></A>is a law at Sparta that the father of three sons shall be exempt from military 
<A NAME="768"></A>service, and he who has four from all the burdens of the state. Yet it 
<A NAME="769"></A>is obvious that, if there were many children, the land being distributed 
<A NAME="770"></A>as it is, many of them must necessarily fall into poverty.
<A NAME="771"></A><BR><BR>The Lacedaemonian constitution is defective in another point; I 
<A NAME="772"></A>mean the Ephoralty. This magistracy has authority in the highest matters, 
<A NAME="773"></A>but the Ephors are chosen from the whole people, and so the office is apt 
<A NAME="774"></A>to fall into the hands of very poor men, who, being badly off, are open 
<A NAME="775"></A>to bribes. There have been many examples at Sparta of this evil in former 
<A NAME="776"></A>times; and quite recently, in the matter of the Andrians, certain of the 
<A NAME="777"></A>Ephors who were bribed did their best to ruin the state. And so great and 
<A NAME="778"></A>tyrannical is their power, that even the kings have been compelled to court 
<A NAME="779"></A>them, so that, in this way as well together with the royal office, the 
<A NAME="780"></A>whole constitution has deteriorated, and from being an aristocracy has 
<A NAME="781"></A>turned into a democracy. The Ephoralty certainly does keep the state together; 
<A NAME="782"></A>for the people are contented when they have a share in the highest office, 
<A NAME="783"></A>and the result, whether due to the legislator or to chance, has been advantageous. 
<A NAME="784"></A>For if a constitution is to be permanent, all the parts of the state must 
<A NAME="785"></A>wish that it should exist and the same arrangements be maintained. This 
<A NAME="786"></A>is the case at Sparta, where the kings desire its permanence because they 
<A NAME="787"></A>have due honor in their own persons; the nobles because they are represented 
<A NAME="788"></A>in the council of elders (for the office of elder is a reward of virtue); 
<A NAME="789"></A>and the people, because all are eligible to the Ephoralty. The election 
<A NAME="790"></A>of Ephors out of the whole people is perfectly right, but ought not to 
<A NAME="791"></A>be carried on in the present fashion, which is too childish. Again, they 
<A NAME="792"></A>have the decision of great causes, although they are quite ordinary men, 
<A NAME="793"></A>and therefore they should not determine them merely on their own judgment, 
<A NAME="794"></A>but according to written rules, and to the laws. Their way of life, too, 
<A NAME="795"></A>is not in accordance with the spirit of the constitution- they have a deal 
<A NAME="796"></A>too much license; whereas, in the case of the other citizens, the excess 
<A NAME="797"></A>of strictness is so intolerable that they run away from the law into the 
<A NAME="798"></A>secret indulgence of sensual pleasures.
<A NAME="799"></A><BR><BR>Again, the council of elders is not free from defects. It may be 
<A NAME="800"></A>said that the elders are good men and well trained in manly virtue; and 
<A NAME="801"></A>that, therefore, there is an advantage to the state in having them. But 
<A NAME="802"></A>that judges of important causes should hold office for life is a disputable 
<A NAME="803"></A>thing, for the mind grows old as well as the body. And when men have been 
<A NAME="804"></A>educated in such a manner that even the legislator himself cannot trust 
<A NAME="805"></A>them, there is real danger. Many of the elders are well known to have taken 
<A NAME="806"></A>bribes and to have been guilty of partiality in public affairs. And therefore 
<A NAME="807"></A>they ought not to be irresponsible; yet at Sparta they are so. But (it 
<A NAME="808"></A>may be replied), 'All magistracies are accountable to the Ephors.' Yes, 
<A NAME="809"></A>but this prerogative is too great for them, and we maintain that the control 
<A NAME="810"></A>should be exercised in some other manner. Further, the mode in which the 
<A NAME="811"></A>Spartans elect their elders is childish; and it is improper that the person 
<A NAME="812"></A>to be elected should canvass for the office; the worthiest should be appointed, 
<A NAME="813"></A>whether he chooses or not. And here the legislator clearly indicates the 
<A NAME="814"></A>same intention which appears in other parts of his constitution; he would 
<A NAME="815"></A>have his citizens ambitious, and he has reckoned upon this quality in the 
<A NAME="816"></A>election of the elders; for no one would ask to be elected if he were not. 
<A NAME="817"></A>Yet ambition and avarice, almost more than any other passions, are the 
<A NAME="818"></A>motives of crime.
<A NAME="819"></A><BR><BR>Whether kings are or are not an advantage to states, I will consider 
<A NAME="820"></A>at another time; they should at any rate be chosen, not as they are now, 
<A NAME="821"></A>but with regard to their personal life and conduct. The legislator himself 
<A NAME="822"></A>obviously did not suppose that he could make them really good men; at least 
<A NAME="823"></A>he shows a great distrust of their virtue. For this reason the Spartans 
<A NAME="824"></A>used to join enemies with them in the same embassy, and the quarrels between 
<A NAME="825"></A>the kings were held to be conservative of the state.
<A NAME="826"></A><BR><BR>Neither did the first introducer of the common meals, called 'phiditia,' 
<A NAME="827"></A>regulate them well. The entertainment ought to have been provided at the 
<A NAME="828"></A>public cost, as in Crete; but among the Lacedaemonians every one is expected 
<A NAME="829"></A>to contribute, and some of them are too poor to afford the expense; thus 
<A NAME="830"></A>the intention of the legislator is frustrated. The common meals were meant 
<A NAME="831"></A>to be a popular institution, but the existing manner of regulating them 
<A NAME="832"></A>is the reverse of popular. For the very poor can scarcely take part in 
<A NAME="833"></A>them; and, according to ancient custom, those who cannot contribute are 
<A NAME="834"></A>not allowed to retain their rights of citizenship.
<A NAME="835"></A><BR><BR>The law about the Spartan admirals has often been censured, and 
<A NAME="836"></A>with justice; it is a source of dissension, for the kings are perpetual 
<A NAME="837"></A>generals, and this office of admiral is but the setting up of another 
<A NAME="838"></A>king.
<A NAME="839"></A><BR><BR>The charge which Plato brings, in the Laws, against the intention 
<A NAME="840"></A>of the legislator, is likewise justified; the whole constitution has regard 
<A NAME="841"></A>to one part of virtue only- the virtue of the soldier, which gives victory 
<A NAME="842"></A>in war. So long as they were at war, therefore, their power was preserved, 
<A NAME="843"></A>but when they had attained empire they fell for of the arts of peace they 
<A NAME="844"></A>knew nothing, and had never engaged in any employment higher than war. 
<A NAME="845"></A>There is another error, equally great, into which they have fallen. Although 
<A NAME="846"></A>they truly think that the goods for which men contend are to be acquired 
<A NAME="847"></A>by virtue rather than by vice, they err in supposing that these goods are 
<A NAME="848"></A>to be preferred to the virtue which gains them.
<A NAME="849"></A><BR><BR>Once more: the revenues of the state are ill-managed; there is 
<A NAME="850"></A>no money in the treasury, although they are obliged to carry on great wars, 
<A NAME="851"></A>and they are unwilling to pay taxes. The greater part of the land being 
<A NAME="852"></A>in the hands of the Spartans, they do not look closely into one another's 
<A NAME="853"></A>contributions. The result which the legislator has produced is the reverse 
<A NAME="854"></A>of beneficial; for he has made his city poor, and his citizens 
<A NAME="855"></A>greedy.
<A NAME="856"></A><BR><BR>Enough respecting the Spartan constitution, of which these are 
<A NAME="857"></A>the principal defects.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="858"></A><B>Part X</B>

<A NAME="859"></A><BR><BR>The Cretan constitution nearly resembles the Spartan, and in some 
<A NAME="860"></A>few points is quite as good; but for the most part less perfect in form. 
<A NAME="861"></A>The older constitutions are generally less elaborate than the later, and 
<A NAME="862"></A>the Lacedaemonian is said to be, and probably is, in a very great measure, 
<A NAME="863"></A>a copy of the Cretan. According to tradition, Lycurgus, when he ceased 
<A NAME="864"></A>to be the guardian of King Charillus, went abroad and spent most of his 
<A NAME="865"></A>time in Crete. For the two countries are nearly connected; the Lyctians 
<A NAME="866"></A>are a colony of the Lacedaemonians, and the colonists, when they came to 
<A NAME="867"></A>Crete, adopted the constitution which they found existing among the inhabitants. 
<A NAME="868"></A>Even to this day the Perioeci, or subject population of Crete, are governed 
<A NAME="869"></A>by the original laws which Minos is supposed to have enacted. The island 
<A NAME="870"></A>seems to be intended by nature for dominion in Hellas, and to be well situated; 
<A NAME="871"></A>it extends right across the sea, around which nearly all the Hellenes are 
<A NAME="872"></A>settled; and while one end is not far from the Peloponnese, the other almost 
<A NAME="873"></A>reaches to the region of Asia about Triopium and Rhodes. Hence Minos acquired 
<A NAME="874"></A>the empire of the sea, subduing some of the islands and colonizing others; 
<A NAME="875"></A>at last he invaded Sicily, where he died near Camicus.
<A NAME="876"></A><BR><BR>The Cretan institutions resemble the Lacedaemonian. The Helots 
<A NAME="877"></A>are the husbandmen of the one, the Perioeci of the other, and both Cretans 
<A NAME="878"></A>and Lacedaemonians have common meals, which were anciently called by the 
<A NAME="879"></A>Lacedaemonians not 'phiditia' but 'andria'; and the Cretans have the same 
<A NAME="880"></A>word, the use of which proves that the common meals originally came from 
<A NAME="881"></A>Crete. Further, the two constitutions are similar; for the office of the 
<A NAME="882"></A>Ephors is the same as that of the Cretan Cosmi, the only difference being 
<A NAME="883"></A>that whereas the Ephors are five, the Cosmi are ten in number. The elders, 
<A NAME="884"></A>too, answer to the elders in Crete, who are termed by the Cretans the council. 
<A NAME="885"></A>And the kingly office once existed in Crete, but was abolished, and the 
<A NAME="886"></A>Cosmi have now the duty of leading them in war. All classes share in the 
<A NAME="887"></A>ecclesia, but it can only ratify the decrees of the elders and the 
<A NAME="888"></A>Cosmi.
<A NAME="889"></A><BR><BR>The common meals of Crete are certainly better managed than the 
<A NAME="890"></A>Lacedaemonian; for in Lacedaemon every one pays so much per head, or, if 
<A NAME="891"></A>he fails, the law, as I have already explained, forbids him to exercise 
<A NAME="892"></A>the rights of citizenship. But in Crete they are of a more popular character. 
<A NAME="893"></A>There, of all the fruits of the earth and cattle raised on the public lands, 
<A NAME="894"></A>and of the tribute which is paid by the Perioeci, one portion is assigned 
<A NAME="895"></A>to the Gods and to the service of the state, and another to the common 
<A NAME="896"></A>meals, so that men, women, and children are all supported out of a common 
<A NAME="897"></A>stock. The legislator has many ingenious ways of securing moderation in 
<A NAME="898"></A>eating, which he conceives to be a gain; he likewise encourages the separation 
<A NAME="899"></A>of men from women, lest they should have too many children, and the companionship 
<A NAME="900"></A>of men with one another- whether this is a good or bad thing I shall have 
<A NAME="901"></A>an opportunity of considering at another time. But that the Cretan common 
<A NAME="902"></A>meals are better ordered than the Lacedaemonian there can be no 
<A NAME="903"></A>doubt.
<A NAME="904"></A><BR><BR>On the other hand, the Cosmi are even a worse institution than 
<A NAME="905"></A>the Ephors, of which they have all the evils without the good. Like the 
<A NAME="906"></A>Ephors, they are any chance persons, but in Crete this is not counterbalanced 
<A NAME="907"></A>by a corresponding political advantage. At Sparta every one is eligible, 
<A NAME="908"></A>and the body of the people, having a share in the highest office, want 
<A NAME="909"></A>the constitution to be permanent. But in Crete the Cosmi are elected out 
<A NAME="910"></A>of certain families, and not out of the whole people, and the elders out 
<A NAME="911"></A>of those who have been Cosmi.
<A NAME="912"></A><BR><BR>The same criticism may be made about the Cretan, which has been 
<A NAME="913"></A>already made about the Lacedaemonian elders. Their irresponsibility and 
<A NAME="914"></A>life tenure is too great a privilege, and their arbitrary power of acting 
<A NAME="915"></A>upon their own judgment, and dispensing with written law, is dangerous. 
<A NAME="916"></A>It is no proof of the goodness of the institution that the people are not 
<A NAME="917"></A>discontented at being excluded from it. For there is no profit to be made 
<A NAME="918"></A>out of the office as out of the Ephoralty, since, unlike the Ephors, the 
<A NAME="919"></A>Cosmi, being in an island, are removed from temptation.
<A NAME="920"></A><BR><BR>The remedy by which they correct the evil of this institution is 
<A NAME="921"></A>an extraordinary one, suited rather to a close oligarchy than to a constitutional 
<A NAME="922"></A>state. For the Cosmi are often expelled by a conspiracy of their own colleagues, 
<A NAME="923"></A>or of private individuals; and they are allowed also to resign before their 
<A NAME="924"></A>term of office has expired. Surely all matters of this kind are better 
<A NAME="925"></A>regulated by law than by the will of man, which is a very unsafe rule. 
<A NAME="926"></A>Worst of all is the suspension of the office of Cosmi, a device to which 
<A NAME="927"></A>the nobles often have recourse when they will not submit to justice. This 
<A NAME="928"></A>shows that the Cretan government, although possessing some of the characteristics 
<A NAME="929"></A>of a constitutional state, is really a close oligarchy.
<A NAME="930"></A><BR><BR>The nobles have a habit, too, of setting up a chief; they get together 
<A NAME="931"></A>a party among the common people and their own friends and then quarrel 
<A NAME="932"></A>and fight with one another. What is this but the temporary destruction 
<A NAME="933"></A>of the state and dissolution of society? A city is in a dangerous condition 
<A NAME="934"></A>when those who are willing are also able to attack her. But, as I have 
<A NAME="935"></A>already said, the island of Crete is saved by her situation; distance has 
<A NAME="936"></A>the same effect as the Lacedaemonian prohibition of strangers; and the 
<A NAME="937"></A>Cretans have no foreign dominions. This is the reason why the Perioeci 
<A NAME="938"></A>are contented in Crete, whereas the Helots are perpetually revolting. But 
<A NAME="939"></A>when lately foreign invaders found their way into the island, the weakness 
<A NAME="940"></A>of the Cretan constitution was revealed. Enough of the government of 
<A NAME="941"></A>Crete.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="942"></A><B>Part XI</B>

<A NAME="943"></A><BR><BR>The Carthaginians are also considered to have an excellent form 
<A NAME="944"></A>of government, which differs from that of any other state in several respects, 
<A NAME="945"></A>though it is in some very like the Lacedaemonian. Indeed, all three states- 
<A NAME="946"></A>the Lacedaemonian, the Cretan, and the Carthaginian- nearly resemble one 
<A NAME="947"></A>another, and are very different from any others. Many of the Carthaginian 
<A NAME="948"></A>institutions are excellent The superiority of their constitution is proved 
<A NAME="949"></A>by the fact that the common people remain loyal to the constitution the 
<A NAME="950"></A>Carthaginians have never had any rebellion worth speaking of, and have 
<A NAME="951"></A>never been under the rule of a tyrant.
<A NAME="952"></A><BR><BR>Among the points in which the Carthaginian constitution resembles 
<A NAME="953"></A>the Lacedaemonian are the following: The common tables of the clubs answer 
<A NAME="954"></A>to the Spartan phiditia, and their magistracy of the 104 to the Ephors; 
<A NAME="955"></A>but, whereas the Ephors are any chance persons, the magistrates of the 
<A NAME="956"></A>Carthaginians are elected according to merit- this is an improvement. They 
<A NAME="957"></A>have also their kings and their gerusia, or council of elders, who correspond 
<A NAME="958"></A>to the kings and elders of Sparta. Their kings, unlike the Spartan, are 
<A NAME="959"></A>not always of the same family, nor that an ordinary one, but if there is 
<A NAME="960"></A>some distinguished family they are selected out of it and not appointed 
<A NAME="961"></A>by senority- this is far better. Such officers have great power, and therefore, 
<A NAME="962"></A>if they are persons of little worth, do a great deal of harm, and they 
<A NAME="963"></A>have already done harm at Lacedaemon.
<A NAME="964"></A><BR><BR>Most of the defects or deviations from the perfect state, for which 
<A NAME="965"></A>the Carthaginian constitution would be censured, apply equally to all the 
<A NAME="966"></A>forms of government which we have mentioned. But of the deflections from 
<A NAME="967"></A>aristocracy and constitutional government, some incline more to democracy 
<A NAME="968"></A>and some to oligarchy. The kings and elders, if unanimous, may determine 
<A NAME="969"></A>whether they will or will not bring a matter before the people, but when 
<A NAME="970"></A>they are not unanimous, the people decide on such matters as well. And 
<A NAME="971"></A>whatever the kings and elders bring before the people is not only heard 
<A NAME="972"></A>but also determined by them, and any one who likes may oppose it; now this 
<A NAME="973"></A>is not permitted in Sparta and Crete. That the magistrates of five who 
<A NAME="974"></A>have under them many important matters should be co-opted, that they should 
<A NAME="975"></A>choose the supreme council of 100, and should hold office longer than other 
<A NAME="976"></A>magistrates (for they are virtually rulers both before and after they hold 
<A NAME="977"></A>office)- these are oligarchical features; their being without salary and 
<A NAME="978"></A>not elected by lot, and any similar points, such as the practice of having 
<A NAME="979"></A>all suits tried by the magistrates, and not some by one class of judges 
<A NAME="980"></A>or jurors and some by another, as at Lacedaemon, are characteristic of 
<A NAME="981"></A>aristocracy. The Carthaginian constitution deviates from aristocracy and 
<A NAME="982"></A>inclines to oligarchy, chiefly on a point where popular opinion is on their 
<A NAME="983"></A>side. For men in general think that magistrates should be chosen not only 
<A NAME="984"></A>for their merit, but for their wealth: a man, they say, who is poor cannot 
<A NAME="985"></A>rule well- he has not the leisure. If, then, election of magistrates for 
<A NAME="986"></A>their wealth be characteristic of oligarchy, and election for merit of 
<A NAME="987"></A>aristocracy, there will be a third form under which the constitution of 
<A NAME="988"></A>Carthage is comprehended; for the Carthaginians choose their magistrates, 
<A NAME="989"></A>and particularly the highest of them- their kings and generals- with an 
<A NAME="990"></A>eye both to merit and to wealth.
<A NAME="991"></A><BR><BR>But we must acknowledge that, in thus deviating from aristocracy, 
<A NAME="992"></A>the legislator has committed an error. Nothing is more absolutely necessary 
<A NAME="993"></A>than to provide that the highest class, not only when in office, but when 
<A NAME="994"></A>out of office, should have leisure and not disgrace themselves in any way; 
<A NAME="995"></A>and to this his attention should be first directed. Even if you must have 
<A NAME="996"></A>regard to wealth, in order to secure leisure, yet it is surely a bad thing 
<A NAME="997"></A>that the greatest offices, such as those of kings and generals, should 
<A NAME="998"></A>be bought. The law which allows this abuse makes wealth of more account 
<A NAME="999"></A>than virtue, and the whole state becomes avaricious. For, whenever the 
<A NAME="1000"></A>chiefs of the state deem anything honorable, the other citizens are sure 
<A NAME="1001"></A>to follow their example; and, where virtue has not the first place, their 
<A NAME="1002"></A>aristocracy cannot be firmly established. Those who have been at the expense 
<A NAME="1003"></A>of purchasing their places will be in the habit of repaying themselves; 
<A NAME="1004"></A>and it is absurd to suppose that a poor and honest man will be wanting 
<A NAME="1005"></A>to make gains, and that a lower stamp of man who has incurred a great expense 
<A NAME="1006"></A>will not. Wherefore they should rule who are able to rule best. And even 
<A NAME="1007"></A>if the legislator does not care to protect the good from poverty, he should 
<A NAME="1008"></A>at any rate secure leisure for them when in office.
<A NAME="1009"></A><BR><BR>It would seem also to be a bad principle that the same person should 
<A NAME="1010"></A>hold many offices, which is a favorite practice among the Carthaginians, 
<A NAME="1011"></A>for one business is better done by one man. The legislator should see to 
<A NAME="1012"></A>this and should not appoint the same person to be a flute-player and a 
<A NAME="1013"></A>shoemaker. Hence, where the state is large, it is more in accordance both 
<A NAME="1014"></A>with constitutional and with democratic principles that the offices of 
<A NAME="1015"></A>state should be distributed among many persons. For, as I said, this arrangement 
<A NAME="1016"></A>is fairer to all, and any action familiarized by repetition is better and 
<A NAME="1017"></A>sooner performed. We have a proof in military and naval matters; the duties 
<A NAME="1018"></A>of command and of obedience in both these services extend to 
<A NAME="1019"></A>all.
<A NAME="1020"></A><BR><BR>The government of the Carthaginians is oligarchical, but they successfully 
<A NAME="1021"></A>escape the evils of oligarchy by enriching one portion of the people after 
<A NAME="1022"></A>another by sending them to their colonies. This is their panacea and the 
<A NAME="1023"></A>means by which they give stability to the state. Accident favors them, 
<A NAME="1024"></A>but the legislator should be able to provide against revolution without 
<A NAME="1025"></A>trusting to accidents. As things are, if any misfortune occurred, and the 
<A NAME="1026"></A>bulk of the subjects revolted, there would be no way of restoring peace 
<A NAME="1027"></A>by legal methods.
<A NAME="1028"></A><BR><BR>Such is the character of the Lacedaemonian, Cretan, and Carthaginian 
<A NAME="1029"></A>constitutions, which are justly celebrated.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="1030"></A><B>Part XII</B>

<A NAME="1031"></A><BR><BR>Of those who have treated of governments, some have never taken 
<A NAME="1032"></A>any part at all in public affairs, but have passed their lives in a private 
<A NAME="1033"></A>station; about most of them, what was worth telling has been already told. 
<A NAME="1034"></A>Others have been lawgivers, either in their own or in foreign cities, whose 
<A NAME="1035"></A>affairs they have administered; and of these some have only made laws, 
<A NAME="1036"></A>others have framed constitutions; for example, Lycurgus and Solon did both. 
<A NAME="1037"></A>Of the Lacedaemonian constitution I have already spoken. As to Solon, he 
<A NAME="1038"></A>is thought by some to have been a good legislator, who put an end to the 
<A NAME="1039"></A>exclusiveness of the oligarchy, emancipated the people, established the 
<A NAME="1040"></A>ancient Athenian democracy, and harmonized the different elements of the 
<A NAME="1041"></A>state. According to their view, the council of Areopagus was an oligarchical 
<A NAME="1042"></A>element, the elected magistracy, aristocratical, and the courts of law, 
<A NAME="1043"></A>democratical. The truth seems to be that the council and the elected magistracy 
<A NAME="1044"></A>existed before the time of Solon, and were retained by him, but that he 
<A NAME="1045"></A>formed the courts of law out of an the citizens, thus creating the democracy, 
<A NAME="1046"></A>which is the very reason why he is sometimes blamed. For in giving the 
<A NAME="1047"></A>supreme power to the law courts, which are elected by lot, he is thought 
<A NAME="1048"></A>to have destroyed the non-democratic element. When the law courts grew 
<A NAME="1049"></A>powerful, to please the people who were now playing the tyrant the old 
<A NAME="1050"></A>constitution was changed into the existing democracy. Ephialtes and Pericles 
<A NAME="1051"></A>curtailed the power of the Areopagus; Pericles also instituted the payment 
<A NAME="1052"></A>of the juries, and thus every demagogue in turn increased the power of 
<A NAME="1053"></A>the democracy until it became what we now see. All this is true; it seems, 
<A NAME="1054"></A>however, to be the result of circumstances, and not to have been intended 
<A NAME="1055"></A>by Solon. For the people, having been instrumental in gaining the empire 
<A NAME="1056"></A>of the sea in the Persian War, began to get a notion of itself, and followed 
<A NAME="1057"></A>worthless demagogues, whom the better class opposed. Solon, himself, appears 
<A NAME="1058"></A>to have given the Athenians only that power of electing to offices and 
<A NAME="1059"></A>calling to account the magistrates which was absolutely necessary; for 
<A NAME="1060"></A>without it they would have been in a state of slavery and enmity to the 
<A NAME="1061"></A>government. All the magistrates he appointed from the notables and the 
<A NAME="1062"></A>men of wealth, that is to say, from the pentacosio-medimni, or from the 
<A NAME="1063"></A>class called zeugitae, or from a third class of so-called knights or cavalry. 
<A NAME="1064"></A>The fourth class were laborers who had no share in any 
<A NAME="1065"></A>magistracy.
<A NAME="1066"></A><BR><BR>Mere legislators were Zaleucus, who gave laws to the Epizephyrian 
<A NAME="1067"></A>Locrians, and Charondas, who legislated for his own city of Catana, and 
<A NAME="1068"></A>for the other Chalcidian cities in Italy and Sicily. Some people attempt 
<A NAME="1069"></A>to make out that Onomacritus was the first person who had any special skill 
<A NAME="1070"></A>in legislation, and that he, although a Locrian by birth, was trained in 
<A NAME="1071"></A>Crete, where he lived in the exercise of his prophetic art; that Thales 
<A NAME="1072"></A>was his companion, and that Lycurgus and Zaleucus were disciples of Thales, 
<A NAME="1073"></A>as Charondas was of Zaleucus. But their account is quite inconsistent with 
<A NAME="1074"></A>chronology.
<A NAME="1075"></A><BR><BR>There was also Philolaus, the Corinthian, who gave laws to the 
<A NAME="1076"></A>Thebans. This Philolaus was one of the family of the Bacchiadae, and a 
<A NAME="1077"></A>lover of Diocles, the Olympic victor, who left Corinth in horror of the 
<A NAME="1078"></A>incestuous passion which his mother Halcyone had conceived for him, and 
<A NAME="1079"></A>retired to Thebes, where the two friends together ended their days. The 
<A NAME="1080"></A>inhabitants still point out their tombs, whic
