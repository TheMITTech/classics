<A NAME="10"></A><B>Part 1</B>
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="11"></A>Whether two things are 'the same' or 'different', in the most literal of 
<A NAME="12"></A>the meanings ascribed to 'sameness' (and we said' that 'the same' applies 
<A NAME="13"></A>in the most literal sense to what is numerically one), may be examined 
<A NAME="14"></A>in the light of their inflexions and coordinates and opposites. For if 
<A NAME="15"></A>justice be the same as courage, then too the just man is the same as the 
<A NAME="16"></A>brave man, and 'justly' is the same as 'bravely'. Likewise, too, in the 
<A NAME="17"></A>case of their opposites: for if two things be the same, their opposites 
<A NAME="18"></A>also will be the same, in any of the recognized forms of opposition. For 
<A NAME="19"></A>it is the same thing to take the opposite of the one or that of the other, 
<A NAME="20"></A>seeing that they are the same. Again it may be examined in the light of 
<A NAME="21"></A>those things which tend to produce or to destroy the things in question 
<A NAME="22"></A>of their formation and destruction, and in general of any thing that is 
<A NAME="23"></A>related in like manner to each. For where things are absolutely the same, 
<A NAME="24"></A>their formations and destructions also are the same, and so are the things 
<A NAME="25"></A>that tend to produce or to destroy them. Look and see also, in a case where 
<A NAME="26"></A>one of two things is said to be something or other in a superlative degree, 
<A NAME="27"></A>if the other of these alleged identical things can also be described by 
<A NAME="28"></A>a superlative in the same respect. Thus Xenocrates argues that the happy 
<A NAME="29"></A>life and the good life are the same, seeing that of all forms of life the 
<A NAME="30"></A>good life is the most desirable and so also is the happy life: for 'the 
<A NAME="31"></A>most desirable' and the greatest' apply but to one thing.' Likewise also 
<A NAME="32"></A>in other cases of the kind. Each, however, of the two things termed 'greatest' 
<A NAME="33"></A>or most desirable' must be numerically one: otherwise no proof will have 
<A NAME="34"></A>been given that they are the same; for it does not follow because Peloponnesians 
<A NAME="35"></A>and Spartans are the bravest of the Greeks, that Peloponnesians are the 
<A NAME="36"></A>same as Spartans, seeing that 'Peloponnesian' is not any one person nor 
<A NAME="37"></A>yet 'Spartan'; it only follows that the one must be included under the 
<A NAME="38"></A>other as 'Spartans' are under 'Peloponnesians': for otherwise, if the one 
<A NAME="39"></A>class be not included under the other, each will be better than the other. 
<A NAME="40"></A>For then the Peloponnesians are bound to be better than the Spartans, seeing 
<A NAME="41"></A>that the one class is not included under the other; for they are better 
<A NAME="42"></A>than anybody else. Likewise also the Spartans must perforce be better than 
<A NAME="43"></A>the Peloponnesians; for they too are better than anybody else; each then 
<A NAME="44"></A>is better than the other! Clearly therefore what is styled 'best' and 'greatest' 
<A NAME="45"></A>must be a single thing, if it is to be proved to be 'the same' as another. 
<A NAME="46"></A>This also is why Xenocrates fails to prove his case: for the happy life 
<A NAME="47"></A>is not numerically single, nor yet the good life, so that it does not follow 
<A NAME="48"></A>that, because they are both the most desirable, they are therefore the 
<A NAME="49"></A>same, but only that the one falls under the other.
<A NAME="50"></A><BR><BR>Again, look and see if, supposing the one to be the same as something, 
<A NAME="51"></A>the other also is the same as it: for if they be not both the same as the 
<A NAME="52"></A>same thing, clearly neither are they the same as one 
<A NAME="53"></A>another.
<A NAME="54"></A><BR><BR>Moreover, examine them in the light of their accidents or of the 
<A NAME="55"></A>things of which they are accidents: for any accident belonging to the one 
<A NAME="56"></A>must belong also to the other, and if the one belong to anything as an 
<A NAME="57"></A>accident, so must the other also. If in any of these respects there is 
<A NAME="58"></A>a discrepancy, clearly they are not the same.
<A NAME="59"></A><BR><BR>See further whether, instead of both being found in one class of 
<A NAME="60"></A>predicates, the one signifies a quality and the other a quantity or relation. 
<A NAME="61"></A>Again, see if the genus of each be not the same, the one being 'good' and 
<A NAME="62"></A>the other evil', or the one being 'virtue' and the other 'knowledge': or 
<A NAME="63"></A>see if, though the genus is the same, the differentiae predicted of either 
<A NAME="64"></A>be not the same, the one (e.g.) being distinguished as a 'speculative' 
<A NAME="65"></A>science, the other as a 'practical' science. Likewise also in other 
<A NAME="66"></A>cases.
<A NAME="67"></A><BR><BR>Moreover, from the point of view of 'degrees', see if the one admits 
<A NAME="68"></A>an increase of degree but not the other, or if though both admit it, they 
<A NAME="69"></A>do not admit it at the same time; just as it is not the case that a man 
<A NAME="70"></A>desires intercourse more intensely, the more intensely he is in love, so 
<A NAME="71"></A>that love and the desire for intercourse are not the 
<A NAME="72"></A>same.
<A NAME="73"></A><BR><BR>Moreover, examine them by means of an addition, and see whether 
<A NAME="74"></A>the addition of each to the same thing fails to make the same whole; or 
<A NAME="75"></A>if the subtraction of the same thing from each leaves a different remainder. 
<A NAME="76"></A>Suppose (e.g.) that he has declared 'double a half' to be the same as 'a 
<A NAME="77"></A>multiple of a half': then, subtracting the words 'a half' from each, the 
<A NAME="78"></A>remainders ought to have signified the same thing: but they do not; for 
<A NAME="79"></A>'double' and 'a multiple of' do not signify the same 
<A NAME="80"></A>thing.
<A NAME="81"></A><BR><BR>Inquire also not only if some impossible consequence results directly 
<A NAME="82"></A>from the statement made, that A and B are the same, but also whether it 
<A NAME="83"></A>is possible for a supposition to bring it about; as happens to those who 
<A NAME="84"></A>assert that 'empty' is the same as 'full of air': for clearly if the air 
<A NAME="85"></A>be exhausted, the vessel will not be less but more empty, though it will 
<A NAME="86"></A>no longer be full of air. So that by a supposition, which may be true or 
<A NAME="87"></A>may be false (it makes no difference which), the one character is annulled 
<A NAME="88"></A>and not the other, showing that they are not the same.
<A NAME="89"></A><BR><BR>Speaking generally, one ought to be on the look-out for any discrepancy 
<A NAME="90"></A>anywhere in any sort of predicate of each term, and in the things of which 
<A NAME="91"></A>they are predicated. For all that is predicated of the one should be predicated 
<A NAME="92"></A>also of the other, and of whatever the one is a predicate, the other should 
<A NAME="93"></A>be a predicate of it as well.
<A NAME="94"></A><BR><BR>Moreover, as 'sameness' is a term used in many senses, see whether 
<A NAME="95"></A>things that are the same in one way are the same also in a different way. 
<A NAME="96"></A>For there is either no necessity or even no possibility that things that 
<A NAME="97"></A>are the same specifically or generically should be numerically the same, 
<A NAME="98"></A>and it is with the question whether they are or are not the same in that 
<A NAME="99"></A>sense that we are concerned.
<A NAME="100"></A><BR><BR>Moreover, see whether the one can exist without the other; for, 
<A NAME="101"></A>if so, they could not be the same.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="102"></A><B>Part 2</B>

<A NAME="103"></A><BR><BR>Such is the number of the commonplace rules that relate to 'sameness'. 
<A NAME="104"></A>It is clear from what has been said that all the destructive commonplaces 
<A NAME="105"></A>relating to sameness are useful also in questions of definition, as was 
<A NAME="106"></A>said before:' for if what is signified by the term and by the expression 
<A NAME="107"></A>be not the same, clearly the expression rendered could not be a definition. 
<A NAME="108"></A>None of the constructive commonplaces, on the other hand, helps in the 
<A NAME="109"></A>matter of definition; for it is not enough to show the sameness of content 
<A NAME="110"></A>between the expression and the term, in order to establish that the former 
<A NAME="111"></A>is a definition, but a definition must have also all the other characters 
<A NAME="112"></A>already announced.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="113"></A><B>Part 3</B>

<A NAME="114"></A><BR><BR>This then is the way, and these the arguments, whereby the attempt 
<A NAME="115"></A>to demolish a definition should always be made. If, on the other hand, 
<A NAME="116"></A>we desire to establish one, the first thing to observe is that few if any 
<A NAME="117"></A>who engage in discussion arrive at a definition by reasoning: they always 
<A NAME="118"></A>assume something of the kind as their starting points-both in geometry 
<A NAME="119"></A>and in arithmetic and the other studies of that kind. In the second place, 
<A NAME="120"></A>to say accurately what a definition is, and how it should be given, belongs 
<A NAME="121"></A>to another inquiry. At present it concerns us only so far as is required 
<A NAME="122"></A>for our present purpose, and accordingly we need only make the bare statement 
<A NAME="123"></A>that to reason to a thing's definition and essence is quite possible. For 
<A NAME="124"></A>if a definition is an expression signifying the essence of the thing and 
<A NAME="125"></A>the predicates contained therein ought also to be the only ones which are 
<A NAME="126"></A>predicated of the thing in the category of essence; and genera and differentiae 
<A NAME="127"></A>are so predicated in that category: it is obvious that if one were to get 
<A NAME="128"></A>an admission that so and so are the only attributes predicated in that 
<A NAME="129"></A>category, the expression containing so and so would of necessity be a definition; 
<A NAME="130"></A>for it is impossible that anything else should be a definition, seeing 
<A NAME="131"></A>that there is not anything else predicated of the thing in the category 
<A NAME="132"></A>of essence.
<A NAME="133"></A><BR><BR>That a definition may thus be reached by a process of reasoning 
<A NAME="134"></A>is obvious. The means whereby it should be established have been more precisely 
<A NAME="135"></A>defined elsewhere, but for the purposes of the inquiry now before us the 
<A NAME="136"></A>same commonplace rules serve. For we have to examine into the contraries 
<A NAME="137"></A>and other opposites of the thing, surveying the expressions used both as 
<A NAME="138"></A>wholes and in detail: for if the opposite definition defines that opposite 
<A NAME="139"></A>term, the definition given must of necessity be that of the term before 
<A NAME="140"></A>us. Seeing, however, that contraries may be conjoined in more than one 
<A NAME="141"></A>way, we have to select from those contraries the one whose contrary definition 
<A NAME="142"></A>seems most obvious. The expressions, then, have to be examined each as 
<A NAME="143"></A>a whole in the way we have said, and also in detail as follows. First of 
<A NAME="144"></A>all, see that the genus rendered is correctly rendered; for if the contrary 
<A NAME="145"></A>thing be found in the contrary genus to that stated in the definition, 
<A NAME="146"></A>and the thing before you is not in that same genus, then it would clearly 
<A NAME="147"></A>be in the contrary genus: for contraries must of necessity be either in 
<A NAME="148"></A>the same genus or in contrary genera. The differentiae, too, that are predicated 
<A NAME="149"></A>of contraries we expect to be contrary, e.g. those of white and black, 
<A NAME="150"></A>for the one tends to pierce the vision, while the other tends to compress 
<A NAME="151"></A>it. So that if contrary differentiae to those in the definition are predicated 
<A NAME="152"></A>of the contrary term, then those rendered in the definition would be predicated 
<A NAME="153"></A>of the term before us. Seeing, then, that both the genus and the differentiae 
<A NAME="154"></A>have been rightly rendered, clearly the expression given must be the right 
<A NAME="155"></A>definition. It might be replied that there is no necessity why contrary 
<A NAME="156"></A>differentiae should be predicated of contraries, unless the contraries 
<A NAME="157"></A>be found within the same genus: of things whose genera are themselves contraries 
<A NAME="158"></A>it may very well be that the same differentia is used of both, e.g. of 
<A NAME="159"></A>justice and injustice; for the one is a virtue and the other a vice of 
<A NAME="160"></A>the soul: 'of the soul', therefore, is the differentia in both cases, seeing 
<A NAME="161"></A>that the body as well has its virtue and vice. But this much at least is 
<A NAME="162"></A>true, that the differentiae of contraries are either contrary or else the 
<A NAME="163"></A>same. If, then, the contrary differentia to that given be predicated of 
<A NAME="164"></A>the contrary term and not of the one in hand, clearly the differentia stated 
<A NAME="165"></A>must be predicated of the latter. Speaking generally, seeing that the definition 
<A NAME="166"></A>consists of genus and differentiae, if the definition of the contrary term 
<A NAME="167"></A>be apparent, the definition of the term before you will be apparent also: 
<A NAME="168"></A>for since its contrary is found either in the same genus or in the contrary 
<A NAME="169"></A>genus, and likewise also the differentiae predicated of opposites are either 
<A NAME="170"></A>contrary to, or the same as, each other, clearly of the term before you 
<A NAME="171"></A>there will be predicated either the same genus as of its contrary, while, 
<A NAME="172"></A>of its differentiae, either all are contrary to those of its contrary, 
<A NAME="173"></A>or at least some of them are so while the rest remain the same; or, vice 
<A NAME="174"></A>versa, the differentiae will be the same and the genera contrary; or both 
<A NAME="175"></A>genera and differentiae will be contrary. And that is all; for that both 
<A NAME="176"></A>should be the same is not possible; else contraries will have the same 
<A NAME="177"></A>definition.
<A NAME="178"></A><BR><BR>Moreover, look at it from the point of view of its inflexions and 
<A NAME="179"></A>coordinates. For genera and definitions are bound to correspond in either 
<A NAME="180"></A>case. Thus if forgetfulness be the loss of knowledge, to forget is to lose 
<A NAME="181"></A>knowledge, and to have forgotten is to have lost knowledge. If, then, any 
<A NAME="182"></A>one whatever of these is agreed to, the others must of necessity be agreed 
<A NAME="183"></A>to as well. Likewise, also, if destruction is the decomposition of the 
<A NAME="184"></A>thing's essence, then to be destroyed is to have its essence decomposed, 
<A NAME="185"></A>and 'destructively' means 'in such a way as to decompose its essence'; 
<A NAME="186"></A>if again 'destructive' means 'apt to decompose something's essence', then 
<A NAME="187"></A>also 'destruction' means 'the decomposition of its essence'. Likewise also 
<A NAME="188"></A>with the rest: an admission of any one of them whatever, and all the rest 
<A NAME="189"></A>are admitted too.
<A NAME="190"></A><BR><BR>Moreover, look at it from the point of view of things that stand 
<A NAME="191"></A>in relations that are like each other. For if 'healthy' means 'productive 
<A NAME="192"></A>of health', 'vigorous' too will mean 'productive of vigour', and 'useful' 
<A NAME="193"></A>will mean 'productive of good.' For each of these things is related in 
<A NAME="194"></A>like manner to its own peculiar end, so that if one of them is defined 
<A NAME="195"></A>as 'productive of' that end, this will also be the definition of each of 
<A NAME="196"></A>the rest as well.
<A NAME="197"></A><BR><BR>Moreover, look at it from the point of and like degrees, in all 
<A NAME="198"></A>the ways in which it is possible to establish a result by comparing two 
<A NAME="199"></A>and two together. Thus if A defines a better than B defines and B is a 
<A NAME="200"></A>definition of so too is A of a. Further, if A's claim to define a is like 
<A NAME="201"></A>B's to define B, and B defines B, then A too defines a. This examination 
<A NAME="202"></A>from the point of view of greater degrees is of no use when a single definition 
<A NAME="203"></A>is compared with two things, or two definitions with one thing; for there 
<A NAME="204"></A>cannot possibly be one definition of two things or two of the same 
<A NAME="205"></A>thing.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="206"></A><B>Part 4</B>

<A NAME="207"></A><BR><BR>The most handy of all the commonplace arguments are those just 
<A NAME="208"></A>mentioned and those from co-ordinates and inflexions, and these therefore 
<A NAME="209"></A>are those which it is most important to master and to have ready to hand: 
<A NAME="210"></A>for they are the most useful on the greatest number of occasions. Of the 
<A NAME="211"></A>rest, too, the most important are those of most general application: for 
<A NAME="212"></A>these are the most effective, e.g. that you should examine the individual 
<A NAME="213"></A>cases, and then look to see in the case of their various species whether 
<A NAME="214"></A>the definition applies. For the species is synonymous with its individuals. 
<A NAME="215"></A>This sort of inquiry is of service against those who assume the existence 
<A NAME="216"></A>of Ideas, as has been said before.' Moreover see if a man has used a term 
<A NAME="217"></A>metaphorically, or predicated it of itself as though it were something 
<A NAME="218"></A>different. So too if any other of the commonplace rules is of general application 
<A NAME="219"></A>and effective, it should be employed.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="220"></A><B>Part 5</B>

<A NAME="221"></A><BR><BR>That it is more difficult to establish than to overthrow a definition, 
<A NAME="222"></A>is obvious from considerations presently to be urged. For to see for oneself, 
<A NAME="223"></A>and to secure from those whom one is questioning, an admission of premisses 
<A NAME="224"></A>of this sort is no simple matter, e.g. that of the elements of the definition 
<A NAME="225"></A>rendered the one is genus and the other differentia, and that only the 
<A NAME="226"></A>genus and differentiae are predicated in the category of essence. Yet without 
<A NAME="227"></A>these premisses it is impossible to reason to a definition; for if any 
<A NAME="228"></A>other things as well are predicated of the thing in the category of essence, 
<A NAME="229"></A>there is no telling whether the formula stated or some other one is its 
<A NAME="230"></A>definition, for a definition is an expression indicating the essence of 
<A NAME="231"></A>a thing. The point is clear also from the following: It is easier to draw 
<A NAME="232"></A>one conclusion than many. Now in demolishing a definition it is sufficient 
<A NAME="233"></A>to argue against one point only (for if we have overthrown any single point 
<A NAME="234"></A>whatsoever, we shall have demolished the definition); whereas in establishing 
<A NAME="235"></A>a definition, one is bound to bring people to the view that everything 
<A NAME="236"></A>contained in the definition is attributable. Moreover, in establishing 
<A NAME="237"></A>a case, the reasoning brought forward must be universal: for the definition 
<A NAME="238"></A>put forward must be predicated of everything of which the term is predicated, 
<A NAME="239"></A>and must moreover be convertible, if the definition rendered is to be peculiar 
<A NAME="240"></A>to the subject. In overthrowing a view, on the other hand, there is no 
<A NAME="241"></A>longer any necessity to show one's point universally: for it is enough 
<A NAME="242"></A>to show that the formula is untrue of any one of the things embraced under 
<A NAME="243"></A>the term.
<A NAME="244"></A><BR><BR>Further, even supposing it should be necessary to overthrow something 
<A NAME="245"></A>by a universal proposition, not even so is there any need to prove the 
<A NAME="246"></A>converse of the proposition in the process of overthrowing the definition. 
<A NAME="247"></A>For merely to show that the definition fails to be predicated of every 
<A NAME="248"></A>one of the things of which the term is predicated, is enough to overthrow 
<A NAME="249"></A>it universally: and there is no need to prove the converse of this in order 
<A NAME="250"></A>to show that the term is predicated of things of which the expression is 
<A NAME="251"></A>not predicated. Moreover, even if it applies to everything embraced under 
<A NAME="252"></A>the term, but not to it alone, the definition is thereby 
<A NAME="253"></A>demolished.
<A NAME="254"></A><BR><BR>The case stands likewise in regard to the property and genus of 
<A NAME="255"></A>a term also. For in both cases it is easier to overthrow than to establish. 
<A NAME="256"></A>As regards the property this is clear from what has been said: for as a 
<A NAME="257"></A>rule the property is rendered in a complex phrase, so that to overthrow 
<A NAME="258"></A>it, it is only necessary to demolish one of the terms used, whereas to 
<A NAME="259"></A>establish it is necessary to reason to them all. Then, too, nearly all 
<A NAME="260"></A>the other rules that apply to the definition will apply also to the property 
<A NAME="261"></A>of a thing. For in establishing a property one has to show that it is true 
<A NAME="262"></A>of everything included under the term in question, whereas to overthrow 
<A NAME="263"></A>one it is enough to show in a single case only that it fails to belong: 
<A NAME="264"></A>further, even if it belongs to everything falling under the term, but not 
<A NAME="265"></A>to that only, it is overthrown in this case as well, as was explained in 
<A NAME="266"></A>the case of the definition. In regard to the genus, it is clear that you 
<A NAME="267"></A>are bound to establish it in one way only, viz. by showing that it belongs 
<A NAME="268"></A>in every case, while of overthrowing it there are two ways: for if it has 
<A NAME="269"></A>been shown that it belongs either never or not in a certain case, the original 
<A NAME="270"></A>statement has been demolished. Moreover, in establishing a genus it is 
<A NAME="271"></A>not enough to show that it belongs, but also that it belongs as genus has 
<A NAME="272"></A>to be shown; whereas in overthrowing it, it is enough to show its failure 
<A NAME="273"></A>to belong either in some particular case or in every case. It appears, 
<A NAME="274"></A>in fact, as though, just as in other things to destroy is easier than to 
<A NAME="275"></A>create, so in these matters too to overthrow is easier than to 
<A NAME="276"></A>establish.
<A NAME="277"></A><BR><BR>In the case of an accidental attribute the universal proposition 
<A NAME="278"></A>is easier to overthrow than to establish; for to establish it, one has 
<A NAME="279"></A>to show that it belongs in every case, whereas to overthrow it, it is enough 
<A NAME="280"></A>to show that it does not belong in one single case. The particular proposition 
<A NAME="281"></A>is, on the contrary, easier to establish than to overthrow: for to establish 
<A NAME="282"></A>it, it is enough to show that it belongs in a particular instance, whereas 
<A NAME="283"></A>to overthrow it, it has to be shown that it never belongs at 
<A NAME="284"></A>all.
<A NAME="285"></A><BR><BR>It is clear also that the easiest thing of all is to overthrow 
<A NAME="286"></A>a definition. For on account of the number of statements involved we are 
<A NAME="287"></A>presented in the definition with the greatest number of points for attack, 
<A NAME="288"></A>and the more plentiful the material, the quicker an argument comes: for 
<A NAME="289"></A>there is more likelihood of a mistake occurring in a large than in a small 
<A NAME="290"></A>number of things. Moreover, the other rules too may be used as means for 
<A NAME="291"></A>attacking a definition: for if either the formula be not peculiar, or the 
<A NAME="292"></A>genus rendered be the wrong one, or something included in the formula fail 
<A NAME="293"></A>to belong, the definition is thereby demolished. On the other hand, against 
<A NAME="294"></A>the others we cannot bring all of the arguments drawn from definitions, 
<A NAME="295"></A>nor yet of the rest: for only those relating to accidental attributes apply 
<A NAME="296"></A>generally to all the aforesaid kinds of attribute. For while each of the 
<A NAME="297"></A>aforesaid kinds of attribute must belong to the thing in question, yet 
<A NAME="298"></A>the genus may very well not belong as a property without as yet being thereby 
<A NAME="299"></A>demolished. Likewise also the property need not belong as a genus, nor 
<A NAME="300"></A>the accident as a genus or property, so long as they do belong. So that 
<A NAME="301"></A>it is impossible to use one set as a basis of attack upon the other except 
<A NAME="302"></A>in the case of definition. Clearly, then, it is the easiest of all things 
<A NAME="303"></A>to demolish a definition, while to establish one is the hardest. For there 
<A NAME="304"></A>one both has to establish all those other points by reasoning (i.e. that 
<A NAME="305"></A>the attributes stated belong, and that the genus rendered is the true genus, 
<A NAME="306"></A>and that the formula is peculiar to the term), and moreover, besides this, 
<A NAME="307"></A>that the formula indicates the essence of the thing; and this has to be 
<A NAME="308"></A>done correctly.
<A NAME="309"></A><BR><BR>Of the rest, the property is most nearly of this kind: for it is 
<A NAME="310"></A>easier to demolish, because as a rule it contains several terms; while 
<A NAME="311"></A>it is the hardest to establish, both because of the number of things that 
<A NAME="312"></A>people must be brought to accept, and, besides this, because it belongs 
<A NAME="313"></A>to its subject alone and is predicated convertibly with its 
<A NAME="314"></A>subject.
<A NAME="315"></A><BR><BR>The easiest thing of all to establish is an accidental predicate: 
<A NAME="316"></A>for in other cases one has to show not only that the predicate belongs, 
<A NAME="317"></A>but also that it belongs in such and such a particular way: whereas in 
<A NAME="318"></A>the case of the accident it is enough to show merely that it belongs. On 
<A NAME="319"></A>the other hand, an accidental predicate is the hardest thing to overthrow, 
<A NAME="320"></A>because it affords the least material: for in stating accident a man does 
<A NAME="321"></A>not add how the predicate belongs; and accordingly, while in other cases 
<A NAME="322"></A>it is possible to demolish what is said in two ways, by showing either 
<A NAME="323"></A>that the predicate does not belong, or that it does not belong in the particular 
<A NAME="324"></A>way stated, in the case of an accidental predicate the only way to demolish 
<A NAME="325"></A>it is to show that it does not belong at all.
<A NAME="326"></A><BR><BR>The commonplace arguments through which we shall be well supplied 
<A NAME="327"></A>with lines of argument with regard to our several problems have now been 
<A NAME="328"></A>enumerated at about sufficient length.
