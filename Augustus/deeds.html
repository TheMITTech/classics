<BR><BR>Translated by Thomas Bushnell, BSG</DIV>
<BR><A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A>A copy below of the deeds of the divine Augustus, by which he subjected 
<A NAME="11"></A>the whole wide earth to the rule of the Roman people, and of the money 
<A NAME="12"></A>which he spent for the state and Roman people, inscribed on two bronze 
<A NAME="13"></A>pillars, which are set up in Rome.
<A NAME="14"></A><BR><BR><B>1.</B> In my nineteenth year, on my own initiative and at my 
<A NAME="15"></A>own expense, I raised an army with which I set free the state, which was 
<A NAME="16"></A>oppressed by the domination of a faction. For that reason, the senate enrolled 
<A NAME="17"></A>me in its order by laudatory resolutions, when Gaius Pansa and Aulus Hirtius 
<A NAME="18"></A>were consuls (43 B.C.E.), assigning me the place of a consul in the giving 
<A NAME="19"></A>of opinions, and gave me the imperium. With me as propraetor, it ordered 
<A NAME="20"></A>me, together with the consuls, to take care lest any detriment befall the 
<A NAME="21"></A>state. But the people made me consul in the same year, when the consuls 
<A NAME="22"></A>each perished in battle, and they made me a triumvir for the settling of 
<A NAME="23"></A>the state.
<A NAME="24"></A><BR><BR><B>2.</B> I drove the men who slaughtered my father into exile 
<A NAME="25"></A>with a legal order, punishing their crime, and afterwards, when they waged 
<A NAME="26"></A>war on the state, I conquered them in two battles.
<A NAME="27"></A><BR><BR><B>3.</B> I often waged war, civil and foreign, on the earth and 
<A NAME="28"></A>sea, in the whole wide world, and as victor I spared all the citizens who 
<A NAME="29"></A>sought pardon. As for foreign nations, those which I was able to safely 
<A NAME="30"></A>forgive, I preferred to preserve than to destroy. About five hundred thousand 
<A NAME="31"></A>Roman citizens were sworn to me. I led something more than three hundred 
<A NAME="32"></A>thousand of them into colonies and I returned them to their cities, after 
<A NAME="33"></A>their stipend had been earned, and I assigned all of them fields or gave 
<A NAME="34"></A>them money for their military service. I captured six hundred ships in 
<A NAME="35"></A>addition to those smaller than triremes.
<A NAME="36"></A><BR><BR><B>4.</B> Twice I triumphed with an ovation, and three times I 
<A NAME="37"></A>enjoyeda curule triumph and twenty one times I was named emperor. When 
<A NAME="38"></A>the senate decreed more triumphs for me, I sat out from all of them. I 
<A NAME="39"></A>placed the laurel from the fasces in the Capitol, when the vows which I 
<A NAME="40"></A>pronounced in each war had been fulfilled. On account of the things successfully 
<A NAME="41"></A>done by me and through my officers, under my auspices, on earth and sea, 
<A NAME="42"></A>the senate decreed fifty-five times that there be sacrifices to the immortal 
<A NAME="43"></A>gods. Moreover there were 890 days on which the senate decreed there would 
<A NAME="44"></A>be sacrifices. In my triumphs kings and nine children of kings were led 
<A NAME="45"></A>before my chariot. I had been consul thirteen times, when I wrote this, 
<A NAME="46"></A>and I was in the thirty-seventh year of tribunician power (14 
<A NAME="47"></A>A.C.E.).
<A NAME="48"></A><BR><BR><B>5.</B> When the dictatorship was offered to me, both in my presence 
<A NAME="49"></A>and my absence, by the people and senate, when Marcus Marcellus and Lucius 
<A NAME="50"></A>Arruntius were consuls (22 B.C.E.), I did not accept it. I did not evade 
<A NAME="51"></A>the curatorship of grain in the height of the food shortage, which I so 
<A NAME="52"></A>arranged that within a few days I freed the entire city from the present 
<A NAME="53"></A>fear and danger by my own expense and administration. When the annual and 
<A NAME="54"></A>perpetual consulate was then again offered to me, I did not accept 
<A NAME="55"></A>it.
<A NAME="56"></A><BR><BR><B>6.</B> When Marcus Vinicius and Quintus Lucretius were consuls 
<A NAME="57"></A>(19 B.C.E.), then again when Publius Lentulus and Gnaeus Lentulus were 
<A NAME="58"></A>(18 B.C.E.), and third when Paullus Fabius Maximus and Quintus Tubero were 
<A NAME="59"></A>(11 B.C.E.), although the senateand Roman people consented that I alone 
<A NAME="60"></A>be made curator of the laws and customs with the highest power, I received 
<A NAME="61"></A>no magistracy offered contrary to the customs of the ancestors. What the 
<A NAME="62"></A>senate then wanted to accomplish through me, I did through tribunician 
<A NAME="63"></A>power, and five times on my own accord I both requested and received from 
<A NAME="64"></A>the senate a colleague in such power.
<A NAME="65"></A><BR><BR><B>7.</B> I was triumvir for the settling of the state for ten 
<A NAME="66"></A>continuous years. I was first of the senate up to that day on which I wrote 
<A NAME="67"></A>this, for forty years. I was high priest, augur, one of the Fifteen for 
<A NAME="68"></A>the performance of rites, one of the Seven of the sacred feasts, brother 
<A NAME="69"></A>of Arvis, fellow of Titus, and Fetial.
<A NAME="70"></A><BR><BR><B>8.</B> When I was consul the fifth time (29 B.C.E.), I increased 
<A NAME="71"></A>the number of patricians by order of the people and senate. I read the 
<A NAME="72"></A>roll of the senate three times, and in my sixth consulate (28 B.C.E.) I 
<A NAME="73"></A>made a census of the people with Marcus Agrippa as my colleague. I conducted 
<A NAME="74"></A>a lustrum, after a forty-one year gap, in which lustrum were counted 4,063,000 
<A NAME="75"></A>heads of Roman citizens. Then again, with consular imperium I conducted 
<A NAME="76"></A>a lustrum alone when Gaius Censorinus and Gaius Asinius were consuls (8 
<A NAME="77"></A>B.C.E.), in which lustrum were counted 4,233,000 heads of Roman citizens. 
<A NAME="78"></A>And the third time, with consular imperium, I conducted a lustrum with 
<A NAME="79"></A>my son Tiberius Caesar as colleague, when Sextus Pompeius and Sextus Appuleius 
<A NAME="80"></A>were consuls (14 A.C.E.), in which lustrum were counted 4,937,000 of the 
<A NAME="81"></A>heads of Roman citizens. By new laws passed with my sponsorship, I restored 
<A NAME="82"></A>many traditions of the ancestors, which were falling into disuse in our 
<A NAME="83"></A>age, and myself I handed on precedents of many things to be imitated in 
<A NAME="84"></A>later generations.
<A NAME="85"></A><BR><BR><B>9.</B> The senate decreed that vows be undertaken for my health 
<A NAME="86"></A>by the consuls and priests every fifth year. In fulfillment of these vows 
<A NAME="87"></A>they often celebrated games for my life; several times the four highest 
<A NAME="88"></A>colleges of priests, several times the consuls. Also both privately and 
<A NAME="89"></A>as a city all the citizens unanimously and continuously prayed at all the 
<A NAME="90"></A>shrines for my health.
<A NAME="91"></A><BR><BR><B>10.</B> By a senate decree my name was included in the Saliar 
<A NAME="92"></A>Hymn, and it was sanctified by a law, both that I would be sacrosanct for 
<A NAME="93"></A>ever, and that, as long as I would live, the tribunician power would be 
<A NAME="94"></A>mine. I was unwilling to be high priest in the place of my living colleague; 
<A NAME="95"></A>when the people offered me that priesthood which my father had, I refused 
<A NAME="96"></A>it. And I received that priesthood, after several years, with the death 
<A NAME="97"></A>of him who had occupied it since the opportunity of the civil disturbance, 
<A NAME="98"></A>with a multitude flocking together out of all Italy to my election, so 
<A NAME="99"></A>many as had never before been in Rome, when Publius Sulpicius and Gaius 
<A NAME="100"></A>Valgius were consuls (12 B.C.E.).
<A NAME="101"></A><BR><BR><B>11.</B> The senate consecrated the altar of Fortune the Bringer-back 
<A NAME="102"></A>before the temples of Honor and Virtue at the Campanian gate for my retrn, 
<A NAME="103"></A>on which it ordered the priests and Vestal virgins to offer yearly sacrifices 
<A NAME="104"></A>on the day when I had returned to the city from Syria (when Quintus Lucretius 
<A NAME="105"></A>and Marcus Vinicius were consuls (19 Bc)), and it named that day Augustalia 
<A NAME="106"></A>after my cognomen.
<A NAME="107"></A><BR><BR><B>12.</B> By the authority of the senate, a part of the praetors 
<A NAME="108"></A>and tribunes of the plebs, with consul Quintus Lucretius and the leading 
<A NAME="109"></A>men, was sent to meet me in Campania, which honor had been decreed for 
<A NAME="110"></A>no one but me until that time. When I returned to Rome from Spain and Gaul, 
<A NAME="111"></A>having successfully accomplished matters in those provinces, when Tiberius 
<A NAME="112"></A>Nero and Publius Quintilius were consuls (13 B.C.E.), the senate voted 
<A NAME="113"></A>to consecrate the altar of August Peace in the field of Mars for my return, 
<A NAME="114"></A>on which it ordered the magistrates and priests and Vestal virgins to offer 
<A NAME="115"></A>annual sacrifices.
<A NAME="116"></A><BR><BR><B>13.</B> Our ancestors wanted Janus Quirinus to be closed when 
<A NAME="117"></A>throughout the all the rule of the Roman people, by land and sea, peace 
<A NAME="118"></A>had been secured through victory. Although before my birth it had been 
<A NAME="119"></A>closed twice in all in recorded memory from the founding of the city, the 
<A NAME="120"></A>senate voted three times in my principate that it be 
<A NAME="121"></A>closed.
<A NAME="122"></A><BR><BR><B>14.</B> When my sons Gaius and Lucius Caesar, whom fortune stole 
<A NAME="123"></A>from me as youths, were fourteen, the senate and Roman people made them 
<A NAME="124"></A>consuls-designate on behalf of my honor, so that they would enter that 
<A NAME="125"></A>magistracy after five years, and the senate decreed that on thatday when 
<A NAME="126"></A>they were led into the forum they would be included in public councils. 
<A NAME="127"></A>Moreover the Roman knights together named each of them first of the youth 
<A NAME="128"></A>and gave them shields and spears.
<A NAME="129"></A><BR><BR><B>15.</B> I paid to the Roman plebs, HS 300 per man from my father's 
<A NAME="130"></A>will and in my own name gave HS 400 from the spoils of war when I was consul 
<A NAME="131"></A>for the fifth time (29 B.C.E.); furthermore I again paid out a public gift 
<A NAME="132"></A>of HS 400 per man, in my tenth consulate (24 B.C.E.), from my own patrimony; 
<A NAME="133"></A>and, when consul for the eleventh time (23 B.C.E.), twelve doles of grain 
<A NAME="134"></A>personally bought were measured out; and in my twelfth year of tribunician 
<A NAME="135"></A>power (12-11 B.C.E.) I gave HS 400 per man for the third time. And these 
<A NAME="136"></A>public gifts of mine never reached fewer than 250,000 men. In my eighteenth 
<A NAME="137"></A>year of tribunician power, as consul for the twelfth time (5 B.C.E.), I 
<A NAME="138"></A>gave to 320,000 plebs of the city HS 240 per man. And, when consul the 
<A NAME="139"></A>fifth time (29 B.C.E.), I gave from my war-spoils to colonies of my soldiers 
<A NAME="140"></A>each HS 1000 per man; about 120,000 men i the colonies received this triumphal 
<A NAME="141"></A>public gift. Consul for the thirteenth time (2 B.C.E.), I gave HS 240 to 
<A NAME="142"></A>the plebs who then received the public grain; they were a few more than 
<A NAME="143"></A>200,000.
<A NAME="144"></A><BR><BR><B>16.</B> I paid the towns money for the fields which I had assigned 
<A NAME="145"></A>to soldiers in my fourth consulate (30 B.C.E.) and then when Marcus Crassus 
<A NAME="146"></A>and Gnaeus Lentulus Augur were consuls (14 B.C.E.); the sum was about HS 
<A NAME="147"></A>600,000,000 which I paid out for Italian estates, and about HS 260,000,000 
<A NAME="148"></A>which I paid for provincial fields. I was first and alone who did this 
<A NAME="149"></A>among all who founded military colonies in Italy or the provinces according 
<A NAME="150"></A>to the memory of my age. And afterwards, when Tiberius Nero and Gnaeus 
<A NAME="151"></A>Piso were consuls (7 B.C.E.), and likewise when Gaius Antistius and Decius 
<A NAME="152"></A>Laelius were consuls (6 B.C.E.), and when Gaius Calvisius and Lucius Passienus 
<A NAME="153"></A>were consuls (4 B.C.E.), and when Lucius Lentulus and Marcus Messalla were 
<A NAME="154"></A>consuls (3 B.C.E.), and when Lucius Caninius and Quintus Fabricius were 
<A NAME="155"></A>consuls (2 B.C.E.) , I paid out rewards in cash to the soldiers whom I 
<A NAME="156"></A>had led into their towns when their service was completed, and in this 
<A NAME="157"></A>venture I spent about HS 400,000,000.
<A NAME="158"></A><BR><BR><B>17.</B> Four times I helped the senatorial treasury with my 
<A NAME="159"></A>money, so that I offered HS 150,000,000 to those who were in charge of 
<A NAME="160"></A>the treasury. And when Marcus Lepidus and Luciu Arruntius were consuls 
<A NAME="161"></A>(6 A.C.E.), I offered HS 170,000,000 from my patrimony to the military 
<A NAME="162"></A>treasury, which was founded by my advice and from which rewards were given 
<A NAME="163"></A>to soldiers who had served twenty or more times.
<A NAME="164"></A><BR><BR><B>18.</B> From that year when Gnaeus and Publius Lentulus were 
<A NAME="165"></A>consuls (18 Bc), when the taxes fell short, I gave out contributions of 
<A NAME="166"></A>grain and money from my granary and patrimony, sometimes to 100,000 men, 
<A NAME="167"></A>sometimes to many more.
<A NAME="168"></A><BR><BR><B>19.</B> I built the senate-house and the Chalcidicum which adjoins 
<A NAME="169"></A>it and the temple of Apollo on the Palatine with porticos, the temple of 
<A NAME="170"></A>divine Julius, the Lupercal, the portico at the Flaminian circus, which 
<A NAME="171"></A>I allowed to be called by the name Octavian, after he who had earlier built 
<A NAME="172"></A>in the same place, the state box at the great circus, the temple on the 
<A NAME="173"></A>Capitoline of Jupiter Subduer and Jupiter Thunderer, the temple of Quirinus, 
<A NAME="174"></A>the temples of Minerva and Queen Juno and Jupiter Liberator on the Aventine, 
<A NAME="175"></A>the temple of the Lares at the top of the holy street, the temple of the 
<A NAME="176"></A>gods of the Penates on the Velian, the temple of Youth, and the temple 
<A NAME="177"></A>of the Great Mother on the Palatine.
<A NAME="178"></A><BR><BR><B>20.</B> I rebuilt the Capitol and the theater of Pompey, each 
<A NAME="179"></A>work at enormous cost, without any inscription of my name. I rebuilt aqueducts 
<A NAME="180"></A>in many places that had decayed with age, and I doubled the capacity of 
<A NAME="181"></A>the Marcian aqueduct by sending a new spring into its channel. I completed 
<A NAME="182"></A>the Forum of Julius and the basilic which he built between the temple of 
<A NAME="183"></A>Castor and the temple of Saturn, works begun and almost finished by my 
<A NAME="184"></A>father. When the same basilica was burned with fire I expanded its grounds 
<A NAME="185"></A>and I began it under an inscription of the name of my sons, and, if I should 
<A NAME="186"></A>not complete it alive, I ordered it to be completed by my heirs. Consul 
<A NAME="187"></A>for the sixth time (28 B.C.E.), I rebuilt eighty-two temples of the gods 
<A NAME="188"></A>in the city by the authority of the senate, omitting nothing which ought 
<A NAME="189"></A>to have been rebuilt at that time. Consul for the seventh time (27 B.C.E.), 
<A NAME="190"></A>I rebuilt the Flaminian road from the city to Ariminum and all the bridges 
<A NAME="191"></A>except the Mulvian and Minucian.
<A NAME="192"></A><BR><BR><B>21.</B> I built the temple of Mars Ultor on private ground and 
<A NAME="193"></A>the forum of Augustus from war-spoils. I build the theater at the temple 
<A NAME="194"></A>of Apollo on ground largely bought from private owners, under the name 
<A NAME="195"></A>of Marcus Marcellus my son-in-law. I consecrated gifts from war-spoils 
<A NAME="196"></A>in the Capitol and in the temple of divine Julius, in the temple of Apollo, 
<A NAME="197"></A>in the tempe of Vesta, and in the temple of Mars Ultor, which cost me about 
<A NAME="198"></A>HS 100,000,000. I sent back gold crowns weighing 35,000 to the towns and 
<A NAME="199"></A>colonies of Italy, which had been contributed for my triumphs, and later, 
<A NAME="200"></A>however many times I was named emperor, I refused gold crowns from the 
<A NAME="201"></A>towns and colonies which they equally kindly decreed, and before they had 
<A NAME="202"></A>decreed them.
<A NAME="203"></A><BR><BR><B>22.</B> Three times I gave shows of gladiators under my name 
<A NAME="204"></A>and five times under the name of my sons and grandsons; in these shows 
<A NAME="205"></A>about 10,000 men fought. Twice I furnished under my name spectacles of 
<A NAME="206"></A>athletes gathered from everywhere, and three times under my grandson's 
<A NAME="207"></A>name. I celebrated games under my name four times, and furthermore in the 
<A NAME="208"></A>place of other magistrates twenty-three times. As master of the college 
<A NAME="209"></A>I celebrated the secular games for the college of the Fifteen, with my 
<A NAME="210"></A>colleague Marcus Agrippa, when Gaius Furnius and Gaius Silanus were consuls 
<A NAME="211"></A>(17 B.C.E.). Consul for the thirteenth time (2 B.C.E.), I celebrated the 
<A NAME="212"></A>first games of Mas, which after that time thereafter in following years, 
<A NAME="213"></A>by a senate decree and a law, the consuls were to celebrate. Twenty-six 
<A NAME="214"></A>times, under my name or that of my sons and grandsons, I gave the people 
<A NAME="215"></A>hunts of African beasts in the circus, in the open, or in the amphitheater; 
<A NAME="216"></A>in them about 3,500 beasts were killed.
<A NAME="217"></A><BR><BR><B>23.</B> I gave the people a spectacle of a naval battle, in 
<A NAME="218"></A>the place across the Tiber where the grove of the Caesars is now, with 
<A NAME="219"></A>the ground excavated in length 1,800 feet, in width 1,200, in which thirty 
<A NAME="220"></A>beaked ships, biremes or triremes, but many smaller, fought among themselves; 
<A NAME="221"></A>in these ships about 3,000 men fought in addition to the 
<A NAME="222"></A>rowers.
<A NAME="223"></A><BR><BR><B>24.</B> In the temples of all the cities of the province of 
<A NAME="224"></A>Asia, as victor, I replaced the ornaments which he with whom I fought the 
<A NAME="225"></A>war had possessed privately after he despoiled the temples. Silver statues 
<A NAME="226"></A>of me-on foot, on horseback, and standing in a chariot-were erected in 
<A NAME="227"></A>about eighty cities, which I myself removed, and from the money I placed 
<A NAME="228"></A>goldn offerings in the temple of Apollo under my name and of those who 
<A NAME="229"></A>paid the honor of the statues to me.
<A NAME="230"></A><BR><BR><B>25.</B> I restored peace to the sea from pirates. In that slave 
<A NAME="231"></A>war I handed over to their masters for the infliction of punishments about 
<A NAME="232"></A>30,000 captured, who had fled their masters and taken up arms against the 
<A NAME="233"></A>state. All Italy swore allegiance to me voluntarily, and demanded me as 
<A NAME="234"></A>leader of the war which I won at Actium; the provinces of Gaul, Spain, 
<A NAME="235"></A>Africa, Sicily, and Sardinia swore the same allegiance. And those who then 
<A NAME="236"></A>fought under my standard were more than 700 senators, among whom 83 were 
<A NAME="237"></A>made consuls either before or after, up to the day this was written, and 
<A NAME="238"></A>about 170 were made priests.
<A NAME="239"></A><BR><BR><B>26.</B> I extended the borders of all the provinces of the Roman 
<A NAME="240"></A>people which neighbored nations not subject to our rule. I restored peace 
<A NAME="241"></A>to the provinces of Gaul and Spain, likewise Germany, which includes the 
<A NAME="242"></A>ocean from Cadiz to the mouth of the river Elbe. I brought peace to the 
<A NAME="243"></A>Alps from the region which i near the Adriatic Sea to the Tuscan, with 
<A NAME="244"></A>no unjust war waged against any nation. I sailed my ships on the ocean 
<A NAME="245"></A>from the mouth of the Rhine to the east region up to the borders of the 
<A NAME="246"></A>Cimbri, where no Roman had gone before that time by land or sea, and the 
<A NAME="247"></A>Cimbri and the Charydes and the Semnones and the other Germans of the same 
<A NAME="248"></A>territory sought by envoys the friendship of me and of the Roman people. 
<A NAME="249"></A>By my order and auspices two armies were led at about the same time into 
<A NAME="250"></A>Ethiopia and into that part of Arabia which is called Happy, and the troops 
<A NAME="251"></A>of each nation of enemies were slaughtered in battle and many towns captured. 
<A NAME="252"></A>They penetrated into Ethiopia all the way to the town Nabata, which is 
<A NAME="253"></A>near to Meroe; and into Arabia all the way to the border of the Sabaei, 
<A NAME="254"></A>advancing to the town Mariba.
<A NAME="255"></A><BR><BR><B>27.</B> I added Egypt to the rule of the Roman people. When 
<A NAME="256"></A>Artaxes, king of Greater Armenia, was killed, though I could have made 
<A NAME="257"></A>it a province, I preferred, by the example of our elders, to hand over 
<A NAME="258"></A>that kingdomto Tigranes, son of king Artavasdes, and grandson of King Tigranes, 
<A NAME="259"></A>through Tiberius Nero, who was then my step-son. And the same nation, after 
<A NAME="260"></A>revolting and rebelling, and subdued through my son Gaius, I handed over 
<A NAME="261"></A>to be ruled by King Ariobarzanes son of Artabazus, King of the Medes, and 
<A NAME="262"></A>after his death, to his son Artavasdes; and when he was killed, I sent 
<A NAME="263"></A>Tigranes, who came from the royal clan of the Armenians, into that rule. 
<A NAME="264"></A>I recovered all the provinces which lie across the Adriatic to the east 
<A NAME="265"></A>and Cyrene, with kings now possessing them in large part, and Sicily and 
<A NAME="266"></A>Sardina, which had been occupied earlier in the slave 
<A NAME="267"></A>war.
<A NAME="268"></A><BR><BR><B>28.</B> I founded colonies of soldiers in Africa, Sicily, Macedonia, 
<A NAME="269"></A>each Spain, Greece, Asia, Syria, Narbonian Gaul, and Pisidia, and furthermore 
<A NAME="270"></A>had twenty-eight colonies founded in Italy under my authority, which were 
<A NAME="271"></A>very populous and crowded while I lived.
<A NAME="272"></A><BR><BR><B>29.</B> I recovered from Spain, Gaul, and Dalmatia the many 
<A NAME="273"></A>military standards lost through other leaders, after defeating te enemies. 
<A NAME="274"></A>I compelled the Parthians to return to me the spoils and standards of three 
<A NAME="275"></A>Roman armies, and as suppliants to seek the friendship of the Roman people. 
<A NAME="276"></A>Furthermore I placed those standards in the sanctuary of the temple of 
<A NAME="277"></A>Mars Ultor.
<A NAME="278"></A><BR><BR><B>30.</B> As for the tribes of the Pannonians, before my principate 
<A NAME="279"></A>no army of the Roman people had entered their land. When they were conquered 
<A NAME="280"></A>through Tiberius Nero, who was then my step-son and emissary, I subjected 
<A NAME="281"></A>them to the rule of the Roman people and extended the borders of Illyricum 
<A NAME="282"></A>to the shores of the river Danube. On the near side of it the army of the 
<A NAME="283"></A>Dacians was conquered and overcome under my auspices, and then my army, 
<A NAME="284"></A>led across the Danube, forced the tribes of the Dacians to bear the rule 
<A NAME="285"></A>of the Roman people.
<A NAME="286"></A><BR><BR><B>31.</B> Emissaries from the Indian kings were often sent to 
<A NAME="287"></A>me, which had not been seen before that time by any Roman leader. The Bastarnae, 
<A NAME="288"></A>the Scythians, and the Sarmatians, who are on this side of the river Don 
<A NAME="289"></A>and the kings further away, an the kings of the Albanians, of the Iberians, 
<A NAME="290"></A>and of the Medes, sought our friendship through emissaries.
<A NAME="291"></A><BR><BR><B>32.</B> To me were sent supplications by kings: of the Parthians, 
<A NAME="292"></A>Tiridates and later Phrates son of king Phrates, of the Medes, Artavasdes, 
<A NAME="293"></A>of the Adiabeni, Artaxares, of the Britons, Dumnobellaunus and Tincommius, 
<A NAME="294"></A>of the Sugambri, Maelo, of the Marcomanian Suebi (...) (-)rus. King Phrates 
<A NAME="295"></A>of the Parthians, son of Orodes, sent all his sons and grandsons into Italy 
<A NAME="296"></A>to me, though defeated in no war, but seeking our friendship through the 
<A NAME="297"></A>pledges of his children. And in my principate many other peoples experienced 
<A NAME="298"></A>the faith of the Roman people, of whom nothing had previously existed of 
<A NAME="299"></A>embassies or interchange of friendship with the Roman 
<A NAME="300"></A>people.
<A NAME="301"></A><BR><BR><B>33.</B> The nations of the Parthians and Medes received from 
<A NAME="302"></A>me the first kings of those nations which they sought by emissaries: the 
<A NAME="303"></A>Parthians, Vonones son of king Phrates, grandson of king Orodes, the Medes, 
<A NAME="304"></A>Ariobarzanes, son of king Artavasdes, grandson of king 
<A NAME="305"></A>Aiobarzanes.
<A NAME="306"></A><BR><BR><B>34.</B> In my sixth and seventh consulates (28-27 B.C.E.), after 
<A NAME="307"></A>putting out the civil war, having obtained all things by universal consent, 
<A NAME="308"></A>I handed over the state from my power to the dominion of the senate and 
<A NAME="309"></A>Roman people. And for this merit of mine, by a senate decree, I was called 
<A NAME="310"></A>Augustus and the doors of my temple were publicly clothed with laurel and 
<A NAME="311"></A>a civic crown was fixed over my door and a gold shield placed in the Julian 
<A NAME="312"></A>senate-house, and the inscription of that shield testified to the virtue, 
<A NAME="313"></A>mercy, justice, and piety, for which the senate and Roman people gave it 
<A NAME="314"></A>to me. After that time, I exceeded all in influence, but I had no greater 
<A NAME="315"></A>power than the others who were colleagues with me in each 
<A NAME="316"></A>magistracy.
<A NAME="317"></A><BR><BR><B>35.</B> When I administered my thirteenth consulate (2 B.C.E.), 
<A NAME="318"></A>the senate and Equestrian order and Roman people all called me father of 
<A NAME="319"></A>the country, and voted that the same be inscribed in the vestibule of my 
<A NAME="320"></A>temple, in the Julian senate-house, and in the forum of Augustus under 
<A NAME="321"></A>the chario which had been placed there for me by a decision of the senate. 
<A NAME="322"></A>When I wrote this I was seventy-six years old.
<A NAME="323"></A><BR><BR><B>Appendix</B>

<A NAME="324"></A><BR><BR>Written after Augustus' death.
<A NAME="325"></A><BR><BR><B>1.</B> All the expenditures which he gave either into the treasury 
<A NAME="326"></A>or to the Roman plebs or to discharged soldiers: HS 
<A NAME="327"></A>2,400,000,000.

<A NAME="329"></A>and Thunderer, of Apollo, of divine Julius, of Minerva, of Queen Juno, 
<A NAME="330"></A>of Jupiter Liberator, of the Lares, of the gods of the Penates, of Youth, 
<A NAME="331"></A>and of the Great Mother, the Lupercal, the state box at the circus, the 
<A NAME="332"></A>senate-house with the Chalcidicum, the forum of Augustus, the Julian basilica, 
<A NAME="333"></A>the theater of Marcellus, the Octavian portico, and the grove of the Caesars 
<A NAME="334"></A>across the Tiber.
<A NAME="335"></A><BR><BR><B>3.</B> He rebuilt the Capitol and holy temples numbering eighty-two, 
<A NAME="336"></A>the theater of Pompey, waterways, and the Flaminian 
<A NAME="337"></A>road.
<A NAME="338"></A><BR><BR><B>4.</B> The sum expended on theatrical spectacles and gladatorial

<A NAME="340"></A>colonies, cities, andtowns destroyed by earthquake and fire or per man 
<A NAME="341"></A>to friends and senators, whom he raised to the senate rating:
