<A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A>Sing, O goddess, the anger of Achilles son of Peleus, that brought countless 
<A NAME="11"></A>ills upon the Achaeans. Many a brave soul did it send hurrying down to 
<A NAME="12"></A>Hades, and many a hero did it yield a prey to dogs and vultures, for so 
<A NAME="13"></A>were the counsels of Jove fulfilled from the day on which the son of Atreus, 
<A NAME="14"></A>king of men, and great Achilles, first fell out with one 
<A NAME="15"></A>another.
<A NAME="16"></A><BR><BR>And which of the gods was it that set them on to quarrel? It was 
<A NAME="17"></A>the son of Jove and Leto; for he was angry with the king and sent a pestilence 
<A NAME="18"></A>upon the host to plague the people, because the son of Atreus had dishonoured 
<A NAME="19"></A>Chryses his priest. Now Chryses had come to the ships of the Achaeans to 
<A NAME="20"></A>free his daughter, and had brought with him a great ransom: moreover he 
<A NAME="21"></A>bore in his hand the sceptre of Apollo wreathed with a suppliant's wreath 
<A NAME="22"></A>and he besought the Achaeans, but most of all the two sons of Atreus, who 
<A NAME="23"></A>were their chiefs.
<A NAME="24"></A><BR><BR>"Sons of Atreus," he cried, "and all other Achaeans, may the gods 
<A NAME="25"></A>who dwell in Olympus grant you to sack the city of Priam, and to reach 
<A NAME="26"></A>your homes in safety; but free my daughter, and accept a ransom for her, 
<A NAME="27"></A>in reverence to Apollo, son of Jove."
<A NAME="28"></A><BR><BR>On this the rest of the Achaeans with one voice were for respecting 
<A NAME="29"></A>the priest and taking the ransom that he offered; but not so Agamemnon, 
<A NAME="30"></A>who spoke fiercely to him and sent him roughly away. "Old man," said he, 
<A NAME="31"></A>"let me not find you tarrying about our ships, nor yet coming hereafter. 
<A NAME="32"></A>Your sceptre of the god and your wreath shall profit you nothing. I will 
<A NAME="33"></A>not free her. She shall grow old in my house at Argos far from her own 
<A NAME="34"></A>home, busying herself with her loom and visiting my couch; so go, and do 
<A NAME="35"></A>not provoke me or it shall be the worse for you."
<A NAME="36"></A><BR><BR>The old man feared him and obeyed. Not a word he spoke, but went 
<A NAME="37"></A>by the shore of the sounding sea and prayed apart to King Apollo whom lovely 
<A NAME="38"></A>Leto had borne. "Hear me," he cried, "O god of the silver bow, that protectest 
<A NAME="39"></A>Chryse and holy Cilla and rulest Tenedos with thy might, hear me oh thou 
<A NAME="40"></A>of Sminthe. If I have ever decked your temple with garlands, or burned 
<A NAME="41"></A>your thigh-bones in fat of bulls or goats, grant my prayer, and let your 
<A NAME="42"></A>arrows avenge these my tears upon the Danaans."
<A NAME="43"></A><BR><BR>Thus did he pray, and Apollo heard his prayer. He came down furious 
<A NAME="44"></A>from the summits of Olympus, with his bow and his quiver upon his shoulder, 
<A NAME="45"></A>and the arrows rattled on his back with the rage that trembled within him. 
<A NAME="46"></A>He sat himself down away from the ships with a face as dark as night, and 
<A NAME="47"></A>his silver bow rang death as he shot his arrow in the midst of them. First 
<A NAME="48"></A>he smote their mules and their hounds, but presently he aimed his shafts 
<A NAME="49"></A>at the people themselves, and all day long the pyres of the dead were 
<A NAME="50"></A>burning.
<A NAME="51"></A><BR><BR>For nine whole days he shot his arrows among the people, but upon 
<A NAME="52"></A>the tenth day Achilles called them in assembly- moved thereto by Juno, 
<A NAME="53"></A>who saw the Achaeans in their death-throes and had compassion upon them. 
<A NAME="54"></A>Then, when they were got together, he rose and spoke among 
<A NAME="55"></A>them.
<A NAME="56"></A><BR><BR>"Son of Atreus," said he, "I deem that we should now turn roving 
<A NAME="57"></A>home if we would escape destruction, for we are being cut down by war and 
<A NAME="58"></A>pestilence at once. Let us ask some priest or prophet, or some reader of 
<A NAME="59"></A>dreams (for dreams, too, are of Jove) who can tell us why Phoebus Apollo 
<A NAME="60"></A>is so angry, and say whether it is for some vow that we have broken, or 
<A NAME="61"></A>hecatomb that we have not offered, and whether he will accept the savour 
<A NAME="62"></A>of lambs and goats without blemish, so as to take away the plague from 
<A NAME="63"></A>us."
<A NAME="64"></A><BR><BR>With these words he sat down, and Calchas son of Thestor, wisest 
<A NAME="65"></A>of augurs, who knew things past present and to come, rose to speak. He 
<A NAME="66"></A>it was who had guided the Achaeans with their fleet to Ilius, through the 
<A NAME="67"></A>prophesyings with which Phoebus Apollo had inspired him. With all sincerity 
<A NAME="68"></A>and goodwill he addressed them thus:-
<A NAME="69"></A><BR><BR>"Achilles, loved of heaven, you bid me tell you about the anger 
<A NAME="70"></A>of King Apollo, I will therefore do so; but consider first and swear that 
<A NAME="71"></A>you will stand by me heartily in word and deed, for I know that I shall 
<A NAME="72"></A>offend one who rules the Argives with might, to whom all the Achaeans are 
<A NAME="73"></A>in subjection. A plain man cannot stand against the anger of a king, who 
<A NAME="74"></A>if he swallow his displeasure now, will yet nurse revenge till he has wreaked 
<A NAME="75"></A>it. Consider, therefore, whether or no you will protect 
<A NAME="76"></A>me."
<A NAME="77"></A><BR><BR>And Achilles answered, "Fear not, but speak as it is borne in upon 
<A NAME="78"></A>you from heaven, for by Apollo, Calchas, to whom you pray, and whose oracles 
<A NAME="79"></A>you reveal to us, not a Danaan at our ships shall lay his hand upon you, 
<A NAME="80"></A>while I yet live to look upon the face of the earth- no, not though you 
<A NAME="81"></A>name Agamemnon himself, who is by far the foremost of the 
<A NAME="82"></A>Achaeans."
<A NAME="83"></A><BR><BR>Thereon the seer spoke boldly. "The god," he said, "is angry neither 
<A NAME="84"></A>about vow nor hecatomb, but for his priest's sake, whom Agamemnon has dishonoured, 
<A NAME="85"></A>in that he would not free his daughter nor take a ransom for her; therefore 
<A NAME="86"></A>has he sent these evils upon us, and will yet send others. He will not 
<A NAME="87"></A>deliver the Danaans from this pestilence till Agamemnon has restored the 
<A NAME="88"></A>girl without fee or ransom to her father, and has sent a holy hecatomb 
<A NAME="89"></A>to Chryse. Thus we may perhaps appease him."
<A NAME="90"></A><BR><BR>With these words he sat down, and Agamemnon rose in anger. His 
<A NAME="91"></A>heart was black with rage, and his eyes flashed fire as he scowled on Calchas 
<A NAME="92"></A>and said, "Seer of evil, you never yet prophesied smooth things concerning 
<A NAME="93"></A>me, but have ever loved to foretell that which was evil. You have brought 
<A NAME="94"></A>me neither comfort nor performance; and now you come seeing among Danaans, 
<A NAME="95"></A>and saying that Apollo has plagued us because I would not take a ransom 
<A NAME="96"></A>for this girl, the daughter of Chryses. I have set my heart on keeping 
<A NAME="97"></A>her in my own house, for I love her better even than my own wife Clytemnestra, 
<A NAME="98"></A>whose peer she is alike in form and feature, in understanding and accomplishments. 
<A NAME="99"></A>Still I will give her up if I must, for I would have the people live, not 
<A NAME="100"></A>die; but you must find me a prize instead, or I alone among the Argives 
<A NAME="101"></A>shall be without one. This is not well; for you behold, all of you, that 
<A NAME="102"></A>my prize is to go elsewhither."
<A NAME="103"></A><BR><BR>And Achilles answered, "Most noble son of Atreus, covetous beyond 
<A NAME="104"></A>all mankind, how shall the Achaeans find you another prize? We have no 
<A NAME="105"></A>common store from which to take one. Those we took from the cities have 
<A NAME="106"></A>been awarded; we cannot disallow the awards that have been made already. 
<A NAME="107"></A>Give this girl, therefore, to the god, and if ever Jove grants us to sack 
<A NAME="108"></A>the city of Troy we will requite you three and fourfold."
<A NAME="109"></A><BR><BR>Then Agamemnon said, "Achilles, valiant though you be, you shall 
<A NAME="110"></A>not thus outwit me. You shall not overreach and you shall not persuade 
<A NAME="111"></A>me. Are you to keep your own prize, while I sit tamely under my loss and 
<A NAME="112"></A>give up the girl at your bidding? Let the Achaeans find me a prize in fair 
<A NAME="113"></A>exchange to my liking, or I will come and take your own, or that of Ajax 
<A NAME="114"></A>or of Ulysses; and he to whomsoever I may come shall rue my coming. But 
<A NAME="115"></A>of this we will take thought hereafter; for the present, let us draw a 
<A NAME="116"></A>ship into the sea, and find a crew for her expressly; let us put a hecatomb 
<A NAME="117"></A>on board, and let us send Chryseis also; further, let some chief man among 
<A NAME="118"></A>us be in command, either Ajax, or Idomeneus, or yourself, son of Peleus, 
<A NAME="119"></A>mighty warrior that you are, that we may offer sacrifice and appease the 
<A NAME="120"></A>the anger of the god."
<A NAME="121"></A><BR><BR>Achilles scowled at him and answered, "You are steeped in insolence 
<A NAME="122"></A>and lust of gain. With what heart can any of the Achaeans do your bidding, 
<A NAME="123"></A>either on foray or in open fighting? I came not warring here for any ill 
<A NAME="124"></A>the Trojans had done me. I have no quarrel with them. They have not raided 
<A NAME="125"></A>my cattle nor my horses, nor cut down my harvests on the rich plains of 
<A NAME="126"></A>Phthia; for between me and them there is a great space, both mountain and 
<A NAME="127"></A>sounding sea. We have followed you, Sir Insolence! for your pleasure, not 
<A NAME="128"></A>ours- to gain satisfaction from the Trojans for your shameless self and 
<A NAME="129"></A>for Menelaus. You forget this, and threaten to rob me of the prize for 
<A NAME="130"></A>which I have toiled, and which the sons of the Achaeans have given me. 
<A NAME="131"></A>Never when the Achaeans sack any rich city of the Trojans do I receive 
<A NAME="132"></A>so good a prize as you do, though it is my hands that do the better part 
<A NAME="133"></A>of the fighting. When the sharing comes, your share is far the largest, 
<A NAME="134"></A>and I, forsooth, must go back to my ships, take what I can get and be thankful, 
<A NAME="135"></A>when my labour of fighting is done. Now, therefore, I shall go back to 
<A NAME="136"></A>Phthia; it will be much better for me to return home with my ships, for 
<A NAME="137"></A>I will not stay here dishonoured to gather gold and substance for 
<A NAME="138"></A>you."
<A NAME="139"></A><BR><BR>And Agamemnon answered, "Fly if you will, I shall make you no prayers 
<A NAME="140"></A>to stay you. I have others here who will do me honour, and above all Jove, 
<A NAME="141"></A>the lord of counsel. There is no king here so hateful to me as you are, 
<A NAME="142"></A>for you are ever quarrelsome and ill affected. What though you be brave? 
<A NAME="143"></A>Was it not heaven that made you so? Go home, then, with your ships and 
<A NAME="144"></A>comrades to lord it over the Myrmidons. I care neither for you nor for 
<A NAME="145"></A>your anger; and thus will I do: since Phoebus Apollo is taking Chryseis 
<A NAME="146"></A>from me, I shall send her with my ship and my followers, but I shall come 
<A NAME="147"></A>to your tent and take your own prize Briseis, that you may learn how much 
<A NAME="148"></A>stronger I am than you are, and that another may fear to set himself up 
<A NAME="149"></A>as equal or comparable with me."
<A NAME="150"></A><BR><BR>The son of Peleus was furious, and his heart within his shaggy 
<A NAME="151"></A>breast was divided whether to draw his sword, push the others aside, and 
<A NAME="152"></A>kill the son of Atreus, or to restrain himself and check his anger. While 
<A NAME="153"></A>he was thus in two minds, and was drawing his mighty sword from its scabbard, 
<A NAME="154"></A>Minerva came down from heaven (for Juno had sent her in the love she bore 
<A NAME="155"></A>to them both), and seized the son of Peleus by his yellow hair, visible 
<A NAME="156"></A>to him alone, for of the others no man could see her. Achilles turned in 
<A NAME="157"></A>amaze, and by the fire that flashed from her eyes at once knew that she 
<A NAME="158"></A>was Minerva. "Why are you here," said he, "daughter of aegis-bearing Jove? 
<A NAME="159"></A>To see the pride of Agamemnon, son of Atreus? Let me tell you- and it shall 
<A NAME="160"></A>surely be- he shall pay for this insolence with his 
<A NAME="161"></A>life."
<A NAME="162"></A><BR><BR>And Minerva said, "I come from heaven, if you will hear me, to 
<A NAME="163"></A>bid you stay your anger. Juno has sent me, who cares for both of you alike. 
<A NAME="164"></A>Cease, then, this brawling, and do not draw your sword; rail at him if 
<A NAME="165"></A>you will, and your railing will not be vain, for I tell you- and it shall 
<A NAME="166"></A>surely be- that you shall hereafter receive gifts three times as splendid 
<A NAME="167"></A>by reason of this present insult. Hold, therefore, and 
<A NAME="168"></A>obey."
<A NAME="169"></A><BR><BR>"Goddess," answered Achilles, "however angry a man may be, he must 
<A NAME="170"></A>do as you two command him. This will be best, for the gods ever hear the 
<A NAME="171"></A>prayers of him who has obeyed them."
<A NAME="172"></A><BR><BR>He stayed his hand on the silver hilt of his sword, and thrust 
<A NAME="173"></A>it back into the scabbard as Minerva bade him. Then she went back to Olympus 
<A NAME="174"></A>among the other gods, and to the house of aegis-bearing 
<A NAME="175"></A>Jove.
<A NAME="176"></A><BR><BR>But the son of Peleus again began railing at the son of Atreus, 
<A NAME="177"></A>for he was still in a rage. "Wine-bibber," he cried, "with the face of 
<A NAME="178"></A>a dog and the heart of a hind, you never dare to go out with the host in 
<A NAME="179"></A>fight, nor yet with our chosen men in ambuscade. You shun this as you do 
<A NAME="180"></A>death itself. You had rather go round and rob his prizes from any man who 
<A NAME="181"></A>contradicts you. You devour your people, for you are king over a feeble 
<A NAME="182"></A>folk; otherwise, son of Atreus, henceforward you would insult no man. Therefore 
<A NAME="183"></A>I say, and swear it with a great oath- nay, by this my sceptre which shalt 
<A NAME="184"></A>sprout neither leaf nor shoot, nor bud anew from the day on which it left 
<A NAME="185"></A>its parent stem upon the mountains- for the axe stripped it of leaf and 
<A NAME="186"></A>bark, and now the sons of the Achaeans bear it as judges and guardians 
<A NAME="187"></A>of the decrees of heaven- so surely and solemnly do I swear that hereafter 
<A NAME="188"></A>they shall look fondly for Achilles and shall not find him. In the day 
<A NAME="189"></A>of your distress, when your men fall dying by the murderous hand of Hector, 
<A NAME="190"></A>you shall not know how to help them, and shall rend your heart with rage 
<A NAME="191"></A>for the hour when you offered insult to the bravest of the 
<A NAME="192"></A>Achaeans."
<A NAME="193"></A><BR><BR>With this the son of Peleus dashed his gold-bestudded sceptre on 
<A NAME="194"></A>the ground and took his seat, while the son of Atreus was beginning fiercely 
<A NAME="195"></A>from his place upon the other side. Then uprose smooth-tongued Nestor, 
<A NAME="196"></A>the facile speaker of the Pylians, and the words fell from his lips sweeter 
<A NAME="197"></A>than honey. Two generations of men born and bred in Pylos had passed away 
<A NAME="198"></A>under his rule, and he was now reigning over the third. With all sincerity 
<A NAME="199"></A>and goodwill, therefore, he addressed them thus:-
<A NAME="200"></A><BR><BR>"Of a truth," he said, "a great sorrow has befallen the Achaean 
<A NAME="201"></A>land. Surely Priam with his sons would rejoice, and the Trojans be glad 
<A NAME="202"></A>at heart if they could hear this quarrel between you two, who are so excellent 
<A NAME="203"></A>in fight and counsel. I am older than either of you; therefore be guided 
<A NAME="204"></A>by me. Moreover I have been the familiar friend of men even greater than 
<A NAME="205"></A>you are, and they did not disregard my counsels. Never again can I behold 
<A NAME="206"></A>such men as Pirithous and Dryas shepherd of his people, or as Caeneus, 
<A NAME="207"></A>Exadius, godlike Polyphemus, and Theseus son of Aegeus, peer of the immortals. 
<A NAME="208"></A>These were the mightiest men ever born upon this earth: mightiest were 
<A NAME="209"></A>they, and when they fought the fiercest tribes of mountain savages they 
<A NAME="210"></A>utterly overthrew them. I came from distant Pylos, and went about among 
<A NAME="211"></A>them, for they would have me come, and I fought as it was in me to do. 
<A NAME="212"></A>Not a man now living could withstand them, but they heard my words, and 
<A NAME="213"></A>were persuaded by them. So be it also with yourselves, for this is the 
<A NAME="214"></A>more excellent way. Therefore, Agamemnon, though you be strong, take not 
<A NAME="215"></A>this girl away, for the sons of the Achaeans have already given her to 
<A NAME="216"></A>Achilles; and you, Achilles, strive not further with the king, for no man 
<A NAME="217"></A>who by the grace of Jove wields a sceptre has like honour with Agamemnon. 
<A NAME="218"></A>You are strong, and have a goddess for your mother; but Agamemnon is stronger 
<A NAME="219"></A>than you, for he has more people under him. Son of Atreus, check your anger, 
<A NAME="220"></A>I implore you; end this quarrel with Achilles, who in the day of battle 
<A NAME="221"></A>is a tower of strength to the Achaeans."
<A NAME="222"></A><BR><BR>And Agamemnon answered, "Sir, all that you have said is true, but 
<A NAME="223"></A>this fellow must needs become our lord and master: he must be lord of all, 
<A NAME="224"></A>king of all, and captain of all, and this shall hardly be. Granted that 
<A NAME="225"></A>the gods have made him a great warrior, have they also given him the right 
<A NAME="226"></A>to speak with railing?"
<A NAME="227"></A><BR><BR>Achilles interrupted him. "I should be a mean coward," he cried, 
<A NAME="228"></A>"were I to give in to you in all things. Order other people about, not 
<A NAME="229"></A>me, for I shall obey no longer. Furthermore I say- and lay my saying to 
<A NAME="230"></A>your heart- I shall fight neither you nor any man about this girl, for 
<A NAME="231"></A>those that take were those also that gave. But of all else that is at my 
<A NAME="232"></A>ship you shall carry away nothing by force. Try, that others may see; if 
<A NAME="233"></A>you do, my spear shall be reddened with your blood."
<A NAME="234"></A><BR><BR>When they had quarrelled thus angrily, they rose, and broke up 
<A NAME="235"></A>the assembly at the ships of the Achaeans. The son of Peleus went back 
<A NAME="236"></A>to his tents and ships with the son of Menoetius and his company, while 
<A NAME="237"></A>Agamemnon drew a vessel into the water and chose a crew of twenty oarsmen. 
<A NAME="238"></A>He escorted Chryseis on board and sent moreover a hecatomb for the god. 
<A NAME="239"></A>And Ulysses went as captain.
<A NAME="240"></A><BR><BR>These, then, went on board and sailed their ways over the sea. 
<A NAME="241"></A>But the son of Atreus bade the people purify themselves; so they purified 
<A NAME="242"></A>themselves and cast their filth into the sea. Then they offered hecatombs 
<A NAME="243"></A>of bulls and goats without blemish on the sea-shore, and the smoke with 
<A NAME="244"></A>the savour of their sacrifice rose curling up towards 
<A NAME="245"></A>heaven.
<A NAME="246"></A><BR><BR>Thus did they busy themselves throughout the host. But Agamemnon 
<A NAME="247"></A>did not forget the threat that he had made Achilles, and called his trusty 
<A NAME="248"></A>messengers and squires Talthybius and Eurybates. "Go," said he, "to the 
<A NAME="249"></A>tent of Achilles, son of Peleus; take Briseis by the hand and bring her 
<A NAME="250"></A>hither; if he will not give her I shall come with others and take her- 
<A NAME="251"></A>which will press him harder."
<A NAME="252"></A><BR><BR>He charged them straightly further and dismissed them, whereon 
<A NAME="253"></A>they went their way sorrowfully by the seaside, till they came to the tents 
<A NAME="254"></A>and ships of the Myrmidons. They found Achilles sitting by his tent and 
<A NAME="255"></A>his ships, and ill-pleased he was when he beheld them. They stood fearfully 
<A NAME="256"></A>and reverently before him, and never a word did they speak, but he knew 
<A NAME="257"></A>them and said, "Welcome, heralds, messengers of gods and men; draw near; 
<A NAME="258"></A>my quarrel is not with you but with Agamemnon who has sent you for the 
<A NAME="259"></A>girl Briseis. Therefore, Patroclus, bring her and give her to them, but 
<A NAME="260"></A>let them be witnesses by the blessed gods, by mortal men, and by the fierceness 
<A NAME="261"></A>of Agamemnon's anger, that if ever again there be need of me to save the 
<A NAME="262"></A>people from ruin, they shall seek and they shall not find. Agamemnon is 
<A NAME="263"></A>mad with rage and knows not how to look before and after that the Achaeans 
<A NAME="264"></A>may fight by their ships in safety."
<A NAME="265"></A><BR><BR>Patroclus did as his dear comrade had bidden him. He brought Briseis 
<A NAME="266"></A>from the tent and gave her over to the heralds, who took her with them 
<A NAME="267"></A>to the ships of the Achaeans- and the woman was loth to go. Then Achilles 
<A NAME="268"></A>went all alone by the side of the hoar sea, weeping and looking out upon 
<A NAME="269"></A>the boundless waste of waters. He raised his hands in prayer to his immortal 
<A NAME="270"></A>mother, "Mother," he cried, "you bore me doomed to live but for a little 
<A NAME="271"></A>season; surely Jove, who thunders from Olympus, might have made that little 
<A NAME="272"></A>glorious. It is not so. Agamemnon, son of Atreus, has done me dishonour, 
<A NAME="273"></A>and has robbed me of my prize by force."
<A NAME="274"></A><BR><BR>As he spoke he wept aloud, and his mother heard him where she was 
<A NAME="275"></A>sitting in the depths of the sea hard by the old man her father. Forthwith 
<A NAME="276"></A>she rose as it were a grey mist out of the waves, sat down before him as 
<A NAME="277"></A>he stood weeping, caressed him with her hand, and said, "My son, why are 
<A NAME="278"></A>you weeping? What is it that grieves you? Keep it not from me, but tell 
<A NAME="279"></A>me, that we may know it together."
<A NAME="280"></A><BR><BR>Achilles drew a deep sigh and said, "You know it; why tell you 
<A NAME="281"></A>what you know well already? We went to Thebe the strong city of Eetion, 
<A NAME="282"></A>sacked it, and brought hither the spoil. The sons of the Achaeans shared 
<A NAME="283"></A>it duly among themselves, and chose lovely Chryseis as the meed of Agamemnon; 
<A NAME="284"></A>but Chryses, priest of Apollo, came to the ships of the Achaeans to free 
<A NAME="285"></A>his daughter, and brought with him a great ransom: moreover he bore in 
<A NAME="286"></A>his hand the sceptre of Apollo, wreathed with a suppliant's wreath, and 
<A NAME="287"></A>he besought the Achaeans, but most of all the two sons of Atreus who were 
<A NAME="288"></A>their chiefs.
<A NAME="289"></A><BR><BR>"On this the rest of the Achaeans with one voice were for respecting 
<A NAME="290"></A>the priest and taking the ransom that he offered; but not so Agamemnon, 
<A NAME="291"></A>who spoke fiercely to him and sent him roughly away. So he went back in 
<A NAME="292"></A>anger, and Apollo, who loved him dearly, heard his prayer. Then the god 
<A NAME="293"></A>sent a deadly dart upon the Argives, and the people died thick on one another, 
<A NAME="294"></A>for the arrows went everywhither among the wide host of the Achaeans. At 
<A NAME="295"></A>last a seer in the fulness of his knowledge declared to us the oracles 
<A NAME="296"></A>of Apollo, and I was myself first to say that we should appease him. Whereon 
<A NAME="297"></A>the son of Atreus rose in anger, and threatened that which he has since 
<A NAME="298"></A>done. The Achaeans are now taking the girl in a ship to Chryse, and sending 
<A NAME="299"></A>gifts of sacrifice to the god; but the heralds have just taken from my 
<A NAME="300"></A>tent the daughter of Briseus, whom the Achaeans had awarded to 
<A NAME="301"></A>myself.
<A NAME="302"></A><BR><BR>"Help your brave son, therefore, if you are able. Go to Olympus, 
<A NAME="303"></A>and if you have ever done him service in word or deed, implore the aid 
<A NAME="304"></A>of Jove. Ofttimes in my father's house have I heard you glory in that you 
<A NAME="305"></A>alone of the immortals saved the son of Saturn from ruin, when the others, 
<A NAME="306"></A>with Juno, Neptune, and Pallas Minerva would have put him in bonds. It 
<A NAME="307"></A>was you, goddess, who delivered him by calling to Olympus the hundred-handed 
<A NAME="308"></A>monster whom gods call Briareus, but men Aegaeon, for he is stronger even 
<A NAME="309"></A>than his father; when therefore he took his seat all-glorious beside the 
<A NAME="310"></A>son of Saturn, the other gods were afraid, and did not bind him. Go, then, 
<A NAME="311"></A>to him, remind him of all this, clasp his knees, and bid him give succour 
<A NAME="312"></A>to the Trojans. Let the Achaeans be hemmed in at the sterns of their ships, 
<A NAME="313"></A>and perish on the sea-shore, that they may reap what joy they may of their 
<A NAME="314"></A>king, and that Agamemnon may rue his blindness in offering insult to the 
<A NAME="315"></A>foremost of the Achaeans."
<A NAME="316"></A><BR><BR>Thetis wept and answered, "My son, woe is me that I should have 
<A NAME="317"></A>borne or suckled you. Would indeed that you had lived your span free from 
<A NAME="318"></A>all sorrow at your ships, for it is all too brief; alas, that you should 
<A NAME="319"></A>be at once short of life and long of sorrow above your peers: woe, therefore, 
<A NAME="320"></A>was the hour in which I bore you; nevertheless I will go to the snowy heights 
<A NAME="321"></A>of Olympus, and tell this tale to Jove, if he will hear our prayer: meanwhile 
<A NAME="322"></A>stay where you are with your ships, nurse your anger against the Achaeans, 
<A NAME="323"></A>and hold aloof from fight. For Jove went yesterday to Oceanus, to a feast 
<A NAME="324"></A>among the Ethiopians, and the other gods went with him. He will return 
<A NAME="325"></A>to Olympus twelve days hence; I will then go to his mansion paved with 
<A NAME="326"></A>bronze and will beseech him; nor do I doubt that I shall be able to persuade 
<A NAME="327"></A>him."
<A NAME="328"></A><BR><BR>On this she left him, still furious at the loss of her that had 
<A NAME="329"></A>been taken from him. Meanwhile Ulysses reached Chryse with the hecatomb. 
<A NAME="330"></A>When they had come inside the harbour they furled the sails and laid them 
<A NAME="331"></A>in the ship's hold; they slackened the forestays, lowered the mast into 
<A NAME="332"></A>its place, and rowed the ship to the place where they would have her lie; 
<A NAME="333"></A>there they cast out their mooring-stones and made fast the hawsers. They 
<A NAME="334"></A>then got out upon the sea-shore and landed the hecatomb for Apollo; Chryseis 
<A NAME="335"></A>also left the ship, and Ulysses led her to the altar to deliver her into 
<A NAME="336"></A>the hands of her father. "Chryses," said he, "King Agamemnon has sent me 
<A NAME="337"></A>to bring you back your child, and to offer sacrifice to Apollo on behalf 
<A NAME="338"></A>of the Danaans, that we may propitiate the god, who has now brought sorrow 
<A NAME="339"></A>upon the Argives."
<A NAME="340"></A><BR><BR>So saying he gave the girl over to her father, who received her 
<A NAME="341"></A>gladly, and they ranged the holy hecatomb all orderly round the altar of 
<A NAME="342"></A>the god. They washed their hands and took up the barley-meal to sprinkle 
<A NAME="343"></A>over the victims, while Chryses lifted up his hands and prayed aloud on 
<A NAME="344"></A>their behalf. "Hear me," he cried, "O god of the silver bow, that protectest 
<A NAME="345"></A>Chryse and holy Cilla, and rulest Tenedos with thy might. Even as thou 
<A NAME="346"></A>didst hear me aforetime when I prayed, and didst press hardly upon the 
<A NAME="347"></A>Achaeans, so hear me yet again, and stay this fearful pestilence from the 
<A NAME="348"></A>Danaans."
<A NAME="349"></A><BR><BR>Thus did he pray, and Apollo heard his prayer. When they had done 
<A NAME="350"></A>praying and sprinkling the barley-meal, they drew back the heads of the 
<A NAME="351"></A>victims and killed and flayed them. They cut out the thigh-bones, wrapped 
<A NAME="352"></A>them round in two layers of fat, set some pieces of raw meat on the top 
<A NAME="353"></A>of them, and then Chryses laid them on the wood fire and poured wine over 
<A NAME="354"></A>them, while the young men stood near him with five-pronged spits in their 
<A NAME="355"></A>hands. When the thigh-bones were burned and they had tasted the inward 
<A NAME="356"></A>meats, they cut the rest up small, put the pieces upon the spits, roasted 
<A NAME="357"></A>them till they were done, and drew them off: then, when they had finished 
<A NAME="358"></A>their work and the feast was ready, they ate it, and every man had his 
<A NAME="359"></A>full share, so that all were satisfied. As soon as they had had enough 
<A NAME="360"></A>to eat and drink, pages filled the mixing-bowl with wine and water and 
<A NAME="361"></A>handed it round, after giving every man his drink-offering.
<A NAME="362"></A><BR><BR>Thus all day long the young men worshipped the god with song, hymning 
<A NAME="363"></A>him and chaunting the joyous paean, and the god took pleasure in their 
<A NAME="364"></A>voices; but when the sun went down, and it came on dark, they laid themselves 
<A NAME="365"></A>down to sleep by the stern cables of the ship, and when the child of morning, 
<A NAME="366"></A>rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared they again set sail for the host of the Achaeans. 
<A NAME="367"></A>Apollo sent them a fair wind, so they raised their mast and hoisted their 
<A NAME="368"></A>white sails aloft. As the sail bellied with the wind the ship flew through 
<A NAME="369"></A>the deep blue water, and the foam hissed against her bows as she sped onward. 
<A NAME="370"></A>When they reached the wide-stretching host of the Achaeans, they drew the 
<A NAME="371"></A>vessel ashore, high and dry upon the sands, set her strong props beneath 
<A NAME="372"></A>her, and went their ways to their own tents and ships.
<A NAME="373"></A><BR><BR>But Achilles abode at his ships and nursed his anger. He went not 
<A NAME="374"></A>to the honourable assembly, and sallied not forth to fight, but gnawed 
<A NAME="375"></A>at his own heart, pining for battle and the war-cry.
<A NAME="376"></A><BR><BR>Now after twelve days the immortal gods came back in a body to 
<A NAME="377"></A>Olympus, and Jove led the way. Thetis was not unmindful of the charge her 
<A NAME="378"></A>son had laid upon her, so she rose from under the sea and went through 
<A NAME="379"></A>great heaven with early morning to Olympus, where she found the mighty 
<A NAME="380"></A>son of Saturn sitting all alone upon its topmost ridges. She sat herself 
<A NAME="381"></A>down before him, and with her left hand seized his knees, while with her 
<A NAME="382"></A>right she caught him under the chin, and besought him, 
<A NAME="383"></A>saying-
<A NAME="384"></A><BR><BR>"Father Jove, if I ever did you service in word or deed among the 
<A NAME="385"></A>immortals, hear my prayer, and do honour to my son, whose life is to be 
<A NAME="386"></A>cut short so early. King Agamemnon has dishonoured him by taking his prize 
<A NAME="387"></A>and keeping her. Honour him then yourself, Olympian lord of counsel, and 
<A NAME="388"></A>grant victory to the Trojans, till the Achaeans give my son his due and 
<A NAME="389"></A>load him with riches in requital."
<A NAME="390"></A><BR><BR>Jove sat for a while silent, and without a word, but Thetis still 
<A NAME="391"></A>kept firm hold of his knees, and besought him a second time. "Incline your 
<A NAME="392"></A>head," said she, "and promise me surely, or else deny me- for you have 
<A NAME="393"></A>nothing to fear- that I may learn how greatly you disdain 
<A NAME="394"></A>me."
<A NAME="395"></A><BR><BR>At this Jove was much troubled and answered, "I shall have trouble 
<A NAME="396"></A>if you set me quarrelling with Juno, for she will provoke me with her taunting 
<A NAME="397"></A>speeches; even now she is always railing at me before the other gods and 
<A NAME="398"></A>accusing me of giving aid to the Trojans. Go back now, lest she should 
<A NAME="399"></A>find out. I will consider the matter, and will bring it about as wish. 
<A NAME="400"></A>See, I incline my head that you believe me. This is the most solemn that 
<A NAME="401"></A>I can give to any god. I never recall my word, or deceive, or fail to do 
<A NAME="402"></A>what I say, when I have nodded my head."
<A NAME="403"></A><BR><BR>As he spoke the son of Saturn bowed his dark brows, and the ambrosial 
<A NAME="404"></A>locks swayed on his immortal head, till vast Olympus 
<A NAME="405"></A>reeled.
<A NAME="406"></A><BR><BR>When the pair had thus laid their plans, they parted- Jove to his 
<A NAME="407"></A>house, while the goddess quitted the splendour of Olympus, and plunged 
<A NAME="408"></A>into the depths of the sea. The gods rose from their seats, before the 
<A NAME="409"></A>coming of their sire. Not one of them dared to remain sitting, but all 
<A NAME="410"></A>stood up as he came among them. There, then, he took his seat. But Juno, 
<A NAME="411"></A>when she saw him, knew that he and the old merman's daughter, silver-footed 
<A NAME="412"></A>Thetis, had been hatching mischief, so she at once began to upbraid him. 
<A NAME="413"></A>"Trickster," she cried, "which of the gods have you been taking into your 
<A NAME="414"></A>counsels now? You are always settling matters in secret behind my back, 
<A NAME="415"></A>and have never yet told me, if you could help it, one word of your 
<A NAME="416"></A>intentions."
<A NAME="417"></A><BR><BR>"Juno," replied the sire of gods and men, "you must not expect 
<A NAME="418"></A>to be informed of all my counsels. You are my wife, but you would find 
<A NAME="419"></A>it hard to understand them. When it is proper for you to hear, there is 
<A NAME="420"></A>no one, god or man, who will be told sooner, but when I mean to keep a 
<A NAME="421"></A>matter to myself, you must not pry nor ask questions."
<A NAME="422"></A><BR><BR>"Dread son of Saturn," answered Juno, "what are you talking about? 
<A NAME="423"></A>I? Pry and ask questions? Never. I let you have your own way in everything. 
<A NAME="424"></A>Still, I have a strong misgiving that the old merman's daughter Thetis 
<A NAME="425"></A>has been talking you over, for she was with you and had hold of your knees 
<A NAME="426"></A>this self-same morning. I believe, therefore, that you have been promising 
<A NAME="427"></A>her to give glory to Achilles, and to kill much people at the ships of 
<A NAME="428"></A>the Achaeans."
<A NAME="429"></A><BR><BR>"Wife," said Jove, "I can do nothing but you suspect me and find 
<A NAME="430"></A>it out. You will take nothing by it, for I shall only dislike you the more, 
<A NAME="431"></A>and it will go harder with you. Granted that it is as you say; I mean to 
<A NAME="432"></A>have it so; sit down and hold your tongue as I bid you for if I once begin 
<A NAME="433"></A>to lay my hands about you, though all heaven were on your side it would 
<A NAME="434"></A>profit you nothing."
<A NAME="435"></A><BR><BR>On this Juno was frightened, so she curbed her stubborn will and 
<A NAME="436"></A>sat down in silence. But the heavenly beings were disquieted throughout 
<A NAME="437"></A>the house of Jove, till the cunning workman Vulcan began to try and pacify 
<A NAME="438"></A>his mother Juno. "It will be intolerable," said he, "if you two fall to 
<A NAME="439"></A>wrangling and setting heaven in an uproar about a pack of mortals. If such 
<A NAME="440"></A>ill counsels are to prevail, we shall have no pleasure at our banquet. 
<A NAME="441"></A>Let me then advise my mother- and she must herself know that it will be 
<A NAME="442"></A>better- to make friends with my dear father Jove, lest he again scold her 
<A NAME="443"></A>and disturb our feast. If the Olympian Thunderer wants to hurl us all from 
<A NAME="444"></A>our seats, he can do so, for he is far the strongest, so give him fair 
<A NAME="445"></A>words, and he will then soon be in a good humour with 
<A NAME="446"></A>us."
<A NAME="447"></A><BR><BR>As he spoke, he took a double cup of nectar, and placed it in his 
<A NAME="448"></A>mother's hand. "Cheer up, my dear mother," said he, "and make the best 
<A NAME="449"></A>of it. I love you dearly, and should be very sorry to see you get a thrashing; 
<A NAME="450"></A>however grieved I might be, I could not help for there is no standing against 
<A NAME="451"></A>Jove. Once before when I was trying to help you, he caught me by the foot 
<A NAME="452"></A>and flung me from the heavenly threshold. All day long from morn till eve, 
<A NAME="453"></A>was I falling, till at sunset I came to ground in the island of Lemnos, 
<A NAME="454"></A>and there I lay, with very little life left in me, till the Sintians came 
<A NAME="455"></A>and tended me."
<A NAME="456"></A><BR><BR>Juno smiled at this, and as she smiled she took the cup from her 
<A NAME="457"></A>son's hands. Then Vulcan drew sweet nectar from the mixing-bowl, and served 
<A NAME="458"></A>it round among the gods, going from left to right; and the blessed gods 
<A NAME="459"></A>laughed out a loud applause as they saw him ing bustling about the heavenly 
<A NAME="460"></A>mansion.
<A NAME="461"></A><BR><BR>Thus through the livelong day to the going down of the sun they 
<A NAME="462"></A>feasted, and every one had his full share, so that all were satisfied. 
<A NAME="463"></A>Apollo struck his lyre, and the Muses lifted up their sweet voices, calling 
<A NAME="464"></A>and answering one another. But when the sun's glorious light had faded, 
<A NAME="465"></A>they went home to bed, each in his own abode, which lame Vulcan with his 
<A NAME="466"></A>consummate skill had fashioned for them. So Jove, the Olympian Lord of 
<A NAME="467"></A>Thunder, hied him to the bed in which he always slept; and when he had 
<A NAME="468"></A>got on to it he went to sleep, with Juno of the golden throne by his 
<A NAME="469"></A>side.
