<A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A>Minerva now put it in Penelope's mind to make the suitors try their skill 
<A NAME="11"></A>with the bow and with the iron axes, in contest among themselves, as a 
<A NAME="12"></A>means of bringing about their destruction. She went upstairs and got the 
<A NAME="13"></A>store room key, which was made of bronze and had a handle of ivory; she 
<A NAME="14"></A>then went with her maidens into the store room at the end of the house, 
<A NAME="15"></A>where her husband's treasures of gold, bronze, and wrought iron were kept, 
<A NAME="16"></A>and where was also his bow, and the quiver full of deadly arrows that had 
<A NAME="17"></A>been given him by a friend whom he had met in Lacedaemon- Iphitus the son 
<A NAME="18"></A>of Eurytus. The two fell in with one another in Messene at the house of 
<A NAME="19"></A>Ortilochus, where Ulysses was staying in order to recover a debt that was 
<A NAME="20"></A>owing from the whole people; for the Messenians had carried off three hundred 
<A NAME="21"></A>sheep from Ithaca, and had sailed away with them and with their shepherds. 
<A NAME="22"></A>In quest of these Ulysses took a long journey while still quite young, 
<A NAME="23"></A>for his father and the other chieftains sent him on a mission to recover 
<A NAME="24"></A>them. Iphitus had gone there also to try and get back twelve brood mares 
<A NAME="25"></A>that he had lost, and the mule foals that were running with them. These 
<A NAME="26"></A>mares were the death of him in the end, for when he went to the house of 
<A NAME="27"></A>Jove's son, mighty Hercules, who performed such prodigies of valour, Hercules 
<A NAME="28"></A>to his shame killed him, though he was his guest, for he feared not heaven's 
<A NAME="29"></A>vengeance, nor yet respected his own table which he had set before Iphitus, 
<A NAME="30"></A>but killed him in spite of everything, and kept the mares himself. It was 
<A NAME="31"></A>when claiming these that Iphitus met Ulysses, and gave him the bow which 
<A NAME="32"></A>mighty Eurytus had been used to carry, and which on his death had been 
<A NAME="33"></A>left by him to his son. Ulysses gave him in return a sword and a spear, 
<A NAME="34"></A>and this was the beginning of a fast friendship, although they never visited 
<A NAME="35"></A>at one another's houses, for Jove's son Hercules killed Iphitus ere they 
<A NAME="36"></A>could do so. This bow, then, given him by Iphitus, had not been taken with 
<A NAME="37"></A>him by Ulysses when he sailed for Troy; he had used it so long as he had 
<A NAME="38"></A>been at home, but had left it behind as having been a keepsake from a valued 
<A NAME="39"></A>friend.
<A NAME="40"></A><BR><BR>Penelope presently reached the oak threshold of the store room; 
<A NAME="41"></A>the carpenter had planed this duly, and had drawn a line on it so as to 
<A NAME="42"></A>get it quite straight; he had then set the door posts into it and hung 
<A NAME="43"></A>the doors. She loosed the strap from the handle of the door, put in the 
<A NAME="44"></A>key, and drove it straight home to shoot back the bolts that held the doors; 
<A NAME="45"></A>these flew open with a noise like a bull bellowing in a meadow, and Penelope 
<A NAME="46"></A>stepped upon the raised platform, where the chests stood in which the fair 
<A NAME="47"></A>linen and clothes were laid by along with fragrant herbs: reaching thence, 
<A NAME="48"></A>she took down the bow with its bow case from the peg on which it hung. 
<A NAME="49"></A>She sat down with it on her knees, weeping bitterly as she took the bow 
<A NAME="50"></A>out of its case, and when her tears had relieved her, she went to the cloister 
<A NAME="51"></A>where the suitors were, carrying the bow and the quiver, with the many 
<A NAME="52"></A>deadly arrows that were inside it. Along with her came her maidens, bearing 
<A NAME="53"></A>a chest that contained much iron and bronze which her husband had won as 
<A NAME="54"></A>prizes. When she reached the suitors, she stood by one of the bearing-posts 
<A NAME="55"></A>supporting the roof of the cloister, holding a veil before her face, and 
<A NAME="56"></A>with a maid on either side of her. Then she said:
<A NAME="57"></A><BR><BR>"Listen to me you suitors, who persist in abusing the hospitality 
<A NAME="58"></A>of this house because its owner has been long absent, and without other 
<A NAME="59"></A>pretext than that you want to marry me; this, then, being the prize that 
<A NAME="60"></A>you are contending for, I will bring out the mighty bow of Ulysses, and 
<A NAME="61"></A>whomsoever of you shall string it most easily and send his arrow through 
<A NAME="62"></A>each one of twelve axes, him will I follow and quit this house of my lawful 
<A NAME="63"></A>husband, so goodly, and so abounding in wealth. But even so I doubt not 
<A NAME="64"></A>that I shall remember it in my dreams."
<A NAME="65"></A><BR><BR>As she spoke, she told Eumaeus to set the bow and the pieces of 
<A NAME="66"></A>iron before the suitors, and Eumaeus wept as he took them to do as she 
<A NAME="67"></A>had bidden him. Hard by, the stockman wept also when he saw his master's 
<A NAME="68"></A>bow, but Antinous scolded them. "You country louts," said he, "silly simpletons; 
<A NAME="69"></A>why should you add to the sorrows of your mistress by crying in this way? 
<A NAME="70"></A>She has enough to grieve her in the loss of her husband; sit still, therefore, 
<A NAME="71"></A>and eat your dinners in silence, or go outside if you want to cry, and 
<A NAME="72"></A>leave the bow behind you. We suitors shall have to contend for it with 
<A NAME="73"></A>might and main, for we shall find it no light matter to string such a bow 
<A NAME="74"></A>as this is. There is not a man of us all who is such another as Ulysses; 
<A NAME="75"></A>for I have seen him and remember him, though I was then only a 
<A NAME="76"></A>child."
<A NAME="77"></A><BR><BR>This was what he said, but all the time he was expecting to be 
<A NAME="78"></A>able to string the bow and shoot through the iron, whereas in fact he was 
<A NAME="79"></A>to be the first that should taste of the arrows from the hands of Ulysses, 
<A NAME="80"></A>whom he was dishonouring in his own house- egging the others on to do so 
<A NAME="81"></A>also.
<A NAME="82"></A><BR><BR>Then Telemachus spoke. "Great heavens!" he exclaimed, "Jove must 
<A NAME="83"></A>have robbed me of my senses. Here is my dear and excellent mother saying 
<A NAME="84"></A>she will quit this house and marry again, yet I am laughing and enjoying 
<A NAME="85"></A>myself as though there were nothing happening. But, suitors, as the contest 
<A NAME="86"></A>has been agreed upon, let it go forward. It is for a woman whose peer is 
<A NAME="87"></A>not to be found in Pylos, Argos, or Mycene, nor yet in Ithaca nor on the 
<A NAME="88"></A>mainland. You know this as well as I do; what need have I to speak in praise 
<A NAME="89"></A>of my mother? Come on, then, make no excuses for delay, but let us see 
<A NAME="90"></A>whether you can string the bow or no. I too will make trial of it, for 
<A NAME="91"></A>if I can string it and shoot through the iron, I shall not suffer my mother 
<A NAME="92"></A>to quit this house with a stranger, not if I can win the prizes which my 
<A NAME="93"></A>father won before me."
<A NAME="94"></A><BR><BR>As he spoke he sprang from his seat, threw his crimson cloak from 
<A NAME="95"></A>him, and took his sword from his shoulder. First he set the axes in a row, 
<A NAME="96"></A>in a long groove which he had dug for them, and had Wade straight by line. 
<A NAME="97"></A>Then he stamped the earth tight round them, and everyone was surprised 
<A NAME="98"></A>when they saw him set up so orderly, though he had never seen anything 
<A NAME="99"></A>of the kind before. This done, he went on to the pavement to make trial 
<A NAME="100"></A>of the bow; thrice did he tug at it, trying with all his might to draw 
<A NAME="101"></A>the string, and thrice he had to leave off, though he had hoped to string 
<A NAME="102"></A>the bow and shoot through the iron. He was trying for the fourth time, 
<A NAME="103"></A>and would have strung it had not Ulysses made a sign to check him in spite 
<A NAME="104"></A>of all his eagerness. So he said:
<A NAME="105"></A><BR><BR>"Alas! I shall either be always feeble and of no prowess, or I 
<A NAME="106"></A>am too young, and have not yet reached my full strength so as to be able 
<A NAME="107"></A>to hold my own if any one attacks me. You others, therefore, who are stronger 
<A NAME="108"></A>than I, make trial of the bow and get this contest settled."
<A NAME="109"></A><BR><BR>On this he put the bow down, letting it lean against the door [that 
<A NAME="110"></A>led into the house] with the arrow standing against the top of the bow. 
<A NAME="111"></A>Then he sat down on the seat from which he had risen, and Antinous 
<A NAME="112"></A>said:
<A NAME="113"></A><BR><BR>"Come on each of you in his turn, going towards the right from 
<A NAME="114"></A>the place at which the. cupbearer begins when he is handing round the 
<A NAME="115"></A>wine."
<A NAME="116"></A><BR><BR>The rest agreed, and Leiodes son of OEnops was the first to rise. 
<A NAME="117"></A>He was sacrificial priest to the suitors, and sat in the corner near the 
<A NAME="118"></A>mixing-bowl. He was the only man who hated their evil deeds and was indignant 
<A NAME="119"></A>with the others. He was now the first to take the bow and arrow, so he 
<A NAME="120"></A>went on to the pavement to make his trial, but he could not string the 
<A NAME="121"></A>bow, for his hands were weak and unused to hard work, they therefore soon 
<A NAME="122"></A>grew tired, and he said to the suitors, "My friends, I cannot string it; 
<A NAME="123"></A>let another have it; this bow shall take the life and soul out of many 
<A NAME="124"></A>a chief among us, for it is better to die than to live after having missed 
<A NAME="125"></A>the prize that we have so long striven for, and which has brought us so 
<A NAME="126"></A>long together. Some one of us is even now hoping and praying that he may 
<A NAME="127"></A>marry Penelope, but when he has seen this bow and tried it, let him woo 
<A NAME="128"></A>and make bridal offerings to some other woman, and let Penelope marry whoever 
<A NAME="129"></A>makes her the best offer and whose lot it is to win 
<A NAME="130"></A>her."
<A NAME="131"></A><BR><BR>On this he put the bow down, letting it lean against the door, 
<A NAME="132"></A>with the arrow standing against the tip of the bow. Then he took his seat 
<A NAME="133"></A>again on the seat from which he had risen; and Antinous rebuked him 
<A NAME="134"></A>saying:
<A NAME="135"></A><BR><BR>"Leiodes, what are you talking about? Your words are monstrous 
<A NAME="136"></A>and intolerable; it makes me angry to listen to you. Shall, then, this 
<A NAME="137"></A>bow take the life of many a chief among us, merely because you cannot bend 
<A NAME="138"></A>it yourself? True, you were not born to be an archer, but there are others 
<A NAME="139"></A>who will soon string it."
<A NAME="140"></A><BR><BR>Then he said to Melanthius the goatherd, "Look sharp, light a fire 
<A NAME="141"></A>in the court, and set a seat hard by with a sheep skin on it; bring us 
<A NAME="142"></A>also a large ball of lard, from what they have in the house. Let us warm 
<A NAME="143"></A>the bow and grease it we will then make trial of it again, and bring the 
<A NAME="144"></A>contest to an end."
<A NAME="145"></A><BR><BR>Melanthius lit the fire, and set a seat covered with sheep skins 
<A NAME="146"></A>beside it. He also brought a great ball of lard from what they had in the 
<A NAME="147"></A>house, and the suitors warmed the bow and again made trial of it, but they 
<A NAME="148"></A>were none of them nearly strong enough to string it. Nevertheless there 
<A NAME="149"></A>still remained Antinous and Eurymachus, who were the ringleaders among 
<A NAME="150"></A>the suitors and much the foremost among them all.
<A NAME="151"></A><BR><BR>Then the swineherd and the stockman left the cloisters together, 
<A NAME="152"></A>and Ulysses followed them. When they had got outside the gates and the 
<A NAME="153"></A>outer yard, Ulysses said to them quietly:
<A NAME="154"></A><BR><BR>"Stockman, and you swineherd, I have something in my mind which 
<A NAME="155"></A>I am in doubt whether to say or no; but I think I will say it. What manner 
<A NAME="156"></A>of men would you be to stand by Ulysses, if some god should bring him back 
<A NAME="157"></A>here all of a sudden? Say which you are disposed to do- to side with the 
<A NAME="158"></A>suitors, or with Ulysses?"
<A NAME="159"></A><BR><BR>"Father Jove," answered the stockman, "would indeed that you might 
<A NAME="160"></A>so ordain it. If some god were but to bring Ulysses back, you should see 
<A NAME="161"></A>with what might and main I would fight for him."
<A NAME="162"></A><BR><BR>In like words Eumaeus prayed to all the gods that Ulysses might 
<A NAME="163"></A>return; when, therefore, he saw for certain what mind they were of, Ulysses 
<A NAME="164"></A>said, "It is I, Ulysses, who am here. I have suffered much, but at last, 
<A NAME="165"></A>in the twentieth year, I am come back to my own country. I find that you 
<A NAME="166"></A>two alone of all my servants are glad that I should do so, for I have not 
<A NAME="167"></A>heard any of the others praying for my return. To you two, therefore, will 
<A NAME="168"></A>I unfold the truth as it shall be. If heaven shall deliver the suitors 
<A NAME="169"></A>into my hands, I will find wives for both of you, will give you house and 
<A NAME="170"></A>holding close to my own, and you shall be to me as though you were brothers 
<A NAME="171"></A>and friends of Telemachus. I will now give you convincing proofs that you 
<A NAME="172"></A>may know me and be assured. See, here is the scar from the boar's tooth 
<A NAME="173"></A>that ripped me when I was out hunting on Mount Parnassus with the sons 
<A NAME="174"></A>of Autolycus."
<A NAME="175"></A><BR><BR>As he spoke he drew his rags aside from the great scar, and when 
<A NAME="176"></A>they had examined it thoroughly, they both of them wept about Ulysses, 
<A NAME="177"></A>threw their arms round him and kissed his head and shoulders, while Ulysses 
<A NAME="178"></A>kissed their hands and faces in return. The sun would have gone down upon 
<A NAME="179"></A>their mourning if Ulysses had not checked them and said:
<A NAME="180"></A><BR><BR>"Cease your weeping, lest some one should come outside and see 
<A NAME="181"></A>us, and tell those who a are within. When you go in, do so separately, 
<A NAME="182"></A>not both together; I will go first, and do you follow afterwards; Let this 
<A NAME="183"></A>moreover be the token between us; the suitors will all of them try to prevent 
<A NAME="184"></A>me from getting hold of the bow and quiver; do you, therefore, Eumaeus, 
<A NAME="185"></A>place it in my hands when you are carrying it about, and tell the women 
<A NAME="186"></A>to close the doors of their apartment. If they hear any groaning or uproar 
<A NAME="187"></A>as of men fighting about the house, they must not come out; they must keep 
<A NAME="188"></A>quiet, and stay where they are at their work. And I charge you, Philoetius, 
<A NAME="189"></A>to make fast the doors of the outer court, and to bind them securely at 
<A NAME="190"></A>once."
<A NAME="191"></A><BR><BR>When he had thus spoken, he went back to the house and took the 
<A NAME="192"></A>seat that he had left. Presently, his two servants followed him 
<A NAME="193"></A>inside.
<A NAME="194"></A><BR><BR>At this moment the bow was in the hands of Eurymachus, who was 
<A NAME="195"></A>warming it by the fire, but even so he could not string it, and he was 
<A NAME="196"></A>greatly grieved. He heaved a deep sigh and said, "I grieve for myself and 
<A NAME="197"></A>for us all; I grieve that I shall have to forgo the marriage, but I do 
<A NAME="198"></A>not care nearly so much about this, for there are plenty of other women 
<A NAME="199"></A>in Ithaca and elsewhere; what I feel most is the fact of our being so inferior 
<A NAME="200"></A>to Ulysses in strength that we cannot string his bow. This will disgrace 
<A NAME="201"></A>us in the eyes of those who are yet unborn."
<A NAME="202"></A><BR><BR>"It shall not be so, Eurymachus," said Antinous, "and you know 
<A NAME="203"></A>it yourself. To-day is the feast of Apollo throughout all the land; who 
<A NAME="204"></A>can string a bow on such a day as this? Put it on one side- as for the 
<A NAME="205"></A>axes they can stay where they are, for no one is likely to come to the 
<A NAME="206"></A>house and take them away: let the cupbearer go round with his cups, that 
<A NAME="207"></A>we may make our drink-offerings and drop this matter of the bow; we will 
<A NAME="208"></A>tell Melanthius to bring us in some goats to-morrow- the best he has; we 
<A NAME="209"></A>can then offer thigh bones to Apollo the mighty archer, and again make 
<A NAME="210"></A>trial of the bow, so as to bring the contest to an end."
<A NAME="211"></A><BR><BR>The rest approved his words, and thereon men servants poured water 
<A NAME="212"></A>over the hands of the guests, while pages filled the mixing-bowls with 
<A NAME="213"></A>wine and water and handed it round after giving every man his drink-offering. 
<A NAME="214"></A>Then, when they had made their offerings and had drunk each as much as 
<A NAME="215"></A>he desired, Ulysses craftily said:
<A NAME="216"></A><BR><BR>"Suitors of the illustrious queen, listen that I may speak even 
<A NAME="217"></A>as I am minded. I appeal more especially to Eurymachus, and to Antinous 
<A NAME="218"></A>who has just spoken with so much reason. Cease shooting for the present 
<A NAME="219"></A>and leave the matter to the gods, but in the morning let heaven give victory 
<A NAME="220"></A>to whom it will. For the moment, however, give me the bow that I may prove 
<A NAME="221"></A>the power of my hands among you all, and see whether I still have as much 
<A NAME="222"></A>strength as I used to have, or whether travel and neglect have made an 
<A NAME="223"></A>end of it."
<A NAME="224"></A><BR><BR>This made them all very angry, for they feared he might string 
<A NAME="225"></A>the bow; Antinous therefore rebuked him fiercely saying, "Wretched creature, 
<A NAME="226"></A>you have not so much as a grain of sense in your whole body; you ought 
<A NAME="227"></A>to think yourself lucky in being allowed to dine unharmed among your betters, 
<A NAME="228"></A>without having any smaller portion served you than we others have had, 
<A NAME="229"></A>and in being allowed to hear our conversation. No other beggar or stranger 
<A NAME="230"></A>has been allowed to hear what we say among ourselves; the wine must have 
<A NAME="231"></A>been doing you a mischief, as it does with all those drink immoderately. 
<A NAME="232"></A>It was wine that inflamed the Centaur Eurytion when he was staying with 
<A NAME="233"></A>Peirithous among the Lapithae. When the wine had got into his head he went 
<A NAME="234"></A>mad and did ill deeds about the house of Peirithous; this angered the heroes 
<A NAME="235"></A>who were there assembled, so they rushed at him and cut off his ears and 
<A NAME="236"></A>nostrils; then they dragged him through the doorway out of the house, so 
<A NAME="237"></A>he went away crazed, and bore the burden of his crime, bereft of understanding. 
<A NAME="238"></A>Henceforth, therefore, there was war between mankind and the centaurs, 
<A NAME="239"></A>but he brought it upon himself through his own drunkenness. In like manner 
<A NAME="240"></A>I can tell you that it will go hardly with you if you string the bow: you 
<A NAME="241"></A>will find no mercy from any one here, for we shall at once ship you off 
<A NAME="242"></A>to king Echetus, who kills every one that comes near him: you will never 
<A NAME="243"></A>get away alive, so drink and keep quiet without getting into a quarrel 
<A NAME="244"></A>with men younger than yourself."
<A NAME="245"></A><BR><BR>Penelope then spoke to him. "Antinous," said she, "it is not right 
<A NAME="246"></A>that you should ill-treat any guest of Telemachus who comes to this house. 
<A NAME="247"></A>If the stranger should prove strong enough to string the mighty bow of 
<A NAME="248"></A>Ulysses, can you suppose that he would take me home with him and make me 
<A NAME="249"></A>his wife? Even the man himself can have no such idea in his mind: none 
<A NAME="250"></A>of you need let that disturb his feasting; it would be out of all 
<A NAME="251"></A>reason."
<A NAME="252"></A><BR><BR>"Queen Penelope," answered Eurymachus, "we do not suppose that 
<A NAME="253"></A>this man will take you away with him; it is impossible; but we are afraid 
<A NAME="254"></A>lest some of the baser sort, men or women among the Achaeans, should go 
<A NAME="255"></A>gossiping about and say, 'These suitors are a feeble folk; they are paying 
<A NAME="256"></A>court to the wife of a brave man whose bow not one of them was able to 
<A NAME="257"></A>string, and yet a beggarly tramp who came to the house strung it at once 
<A NAME="258"></A>and sent an arrow through the iron.' This is what will be said, and it 
<A NAME="259"></A>will be a scandal against us."
<A NAME="260"></A><BR><BR>"Eurymachus," Penelope answered, "people who persist in eating 
<A NAME="261"></A>up the estate of a great chieftain and dishonouring his house must not 
<A NAME="262"></A>expect others to think well of them. Why then should you mind if men talk 
<A NAME="263"></A>as you think they will? This stranger is strong and well-built, he says 
<A NAME="264"></A>moreover that he is of noble birth. Give him the bow, and let us see whether 
<A NAME="265"></A>he can string it or no. I say- and it shall surely be- that if Apollo vouchsafes 
<A NAME="266"></A>him the glory of stringing it, I will give him a cloak and shirt of good 
<A NAME="267"></A>wear, with a javelin to keep off dogs and robbers, and a sharp sword. I 
<A NAME="268"></A>will also give him sandals, and will see him sent safely whereever he wants 
<A NAME="269"></A>to go."
<A NAME="270"></A><BR><BR>Then Telemachus said, "Mother, I am the only man either in Ithaca 
<A NAME="271"></A>or in the islands that are over against Elis who has the right to let any 
<A NAME="272"></A>one have the bow or to refuse it. No one shall force me one way or the 
<A NAME="273"></A>other, not even though I choose to make the stranger a present of the bow 
<A NAME="274"></A>outright, and let him take it away with him. Go, then, within the house 
<A NAME="275"></A>and busy yourself with your daily duties, your loom, your distaff, and 
<A NAME="276"></A>the ordering of your servants. This bow is a man's matter, and mine above 
<A NAME="277"></A>all others, for it is I who am master here."
<A NAME="278"></A><BR><BR>She went wondering back into the house, and laid her son's saying 
<A NAME="279"></A>in her heart. Then going upstairs with her handmaids into her room, she 
<A NAME="280"></A>mourned her dear husband till Minerva sent sweet sleep over her 
<A NAME="281"></A>eyelids.
<A NAME="282"></A><BR><BR>The swineherd now took up the bow and was for taking it to Ulysses, 
<A NAME="283"></A>but the suitors clamoured at him from all parts of the cloisters, and one 
<A NAME="284"></A>of them said, "You idiot, where are you taking the bow to? Are you out 
<A NAME="285"></A>of your wits? If Apollo and the other gods will grant our prayer, your 
<A NAME="286"></A>own boarhounds shall get you into some quiet little place, and worry you 
<A NAME="287"></A>to death."
<A NAME="288"></A><BR><BR>Eumaeus was frightened at the outcry they all raised, so he put 
<A NAME="289"></A>the bow down then and there, but Telemachus shouted out at him from the 
<A NAME="290"></A>other side of the cloisters, and threatened him saying, "Father Eumaeus, 
<A NAME="291"></A>bring the bow on in spite of them, or young as I am I will pelt you with 
<A NAME="292"></A>stones back to the country, for I am the better man of the two. I wish 
<A NAME="293"></A>I was as much stronger than all the other suitors in the house as I am 
<A NAME="294"></A>than you, I would soon send some of them off sick and sorry, for they mean 
<A NAME="295"></A>mischief."
<A NAME="296"></A><BR><BR>Thus did he speak, and they all of them laughed heartily, which 
<A NAME="297"></A>put them in a better humour with Telemachus; so Eumaeus brought the bow 
<A NAME="298"></A>on and placed it in the hands of Ulysses. When he had done this, he called 
<A NAME="299"></A>Euryclea apart and said to her, "Euryclea, Telemachus says you are to close 
<A NAME="300"></A>the doors of the women's apartments. If they hear any groaning or uproar 
<A NAME="301"></A>as of men fighting about the house, they are not to come out, but are to 
<A NAME="302"></A>keep quiet and stay where they are at their work."
<A NAME="303"></A><BR><BR>Euryclea did as she was told and closed the doors of the women's 
<A NAME="304"></A>apartments.
<A NAME="305"></A><BR><BR>Meanwhile Philoetius slipped quietly out and made fast the gates 
<A NAME="306"></A>of the outer court. There was a ship's cable of byblus fibre lying in the 
<A NAME="307"></A>gatehouse, so he made the gates fast with it and then came in again, resuming 
<A NAME="308"></A>the seat that he had left, and keeping an eye on Ulysses, who had now got 
<A NAME="309"></A>the bow in his hands, and was turning it every way about, and proving it 
<A NAME="310"></A>all over to see whether the worms had been eating into its two horns during 
<A NAME="311"></A>his absence. Then would one turn towards his neighbour saying, "This is 
<A NAME="312"></A>some tricky old bow-fancier; either he has got one like it at home, or 
<A NAME="313"></A>he wants to make one, in such workmanlike style does the old vagabond handle 
<A NAME="314"></A>it."
<A NAME="315"></A><BR><BR>Another said, "I hope he may be no more successful in other things 
<A NAME="316"></A>than he is likely to be in stringing this bow."
<A NAME="317"></A><BR><BR>But Ulysses, when he had taken it up and examined it all over, 
<A NAME="318"></A>strung it as easily as a skilled bard strings a new peg of his lyre and 
<A NAME="319"></A>makes the twisted gut fast at both ends. Then he took it in his right hand 
<A NAME="320"></A>to prove the string, and it sang sweetly under his touch like the twittering 
<A NAME="321"></A>of a swallow. The suitors were dismayed, and turned colour as they heard 
<A NAME="322"></A>it; at that moment, moreover, Jove thundered loudly as a sign, and the 
<A NAME="323"></A>heart of Ulysses rejoiced as he heard the omen that the son of scheming 
<A NAME="324"></A>Saturn had sent him.
<A NAME="325"></A><BR><BR>He took an arrow that was lying upon the table- for those which 
<A NAME="326"></A>the Achaeans were so shortly about to taste were all inside the quiver- 
<A NAME="327"></A>he laid it on the centre-piece of the bow, and drew the notch of the arrow 
<A NAME="328"></A>and the string toward him, still seated on his seat. When he had taken 
<A NAME="329"></A>aim he let fly, and his arrow pierced every one of the handle-holes of 
<A NAME="330"></A>the axes from the first onwards till it had gone right through them, and 
<A NAME="331"></A>into the outer courtyard. Then he said to Telemachus:
<A NAME="332"></A><BR><BR>"Your guest has not disgraced you, Telemachus. I did not miss what 
<A NAME="333"></A>I aimed at, and I was not long in stringing my bow. I am still strong, 
<A NAME="334"></A>and not as the suitors twit me with being. Now, however, it is time for 
<A NAME="335"></A>the Achaeans to prepare supper while there is still daylight, and then 
<A NAME="336"></A>otherwise to disport themselves with song and dance which are the crowning 
<A NAME="337"></A>ornaments of a banquet."
<A NAME="338"></A><BR><BR>As he spoke he made a sign with his eyebrows, and Telemachus girded 
<A NAME="339"></A>on his sword, grasped his spear, and stood armed beside his father's 
<A NAME="340"></A>seat.
