<A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A>But when their flight had taken them past the trench and the set stakes, 
<A NAME="11"></A>and many had fallen by the hands of the Danaans, the Trojans made a halt 
<A NAME="12"></A>on reaching their chariots, routed and pale with fear. Jove now woke on 
<A NAME="13"></A>the crests of Ida, where he was lying with golden-throned Juno by his side, 
<A NAME="14"></A>and starting to his feet he saw the Trojans and Achaeans, the one thrown 
<A NAME="15"></A>into confusion, and the others driving them pell-mell before them with 
<A NAME="16"></A>King Neptune in their midst. He saw Hector lying on the ground with his 
<A NAME="17"></A>comrades gathered round him, gasping for breath, wandering in mind and 
<A NAME="18"></A>vomiting blood, for it was not the feeblest of the Achaeans who struck 
<A NAME="19"></A>him.
<A NAME="20"></A><BR><BR>The sire of gods and men had pity on him, and looked fiercely on 
<A NAME="21"></A>Juno. "I see, Juno," said he, "you mischief- making trickster, that your 
<A NAME="22"></A>cunning has stayed Hector from fighting and has caused the rout of his 
<A NAME="23"></A>host. I am in half a mind to thrash you, in which case you will be the 
<A NAME="24"></A>first to reap the fruits of your scurvy knavery. Do you not remember how 
<A NAME="25"></A>once upon a time I had you hanged? I fastened two anvils on to your feet, 
<A NAME="26"></A>and bound your hands in a chain of gold which none might break, and you 
<A NAME="27"></A>hung in mid-air among the clouds. All the gods in Olympus were in a fury, 
<A NAME="28"></A>but they could not reach you to set you free; when I caught any one of 
<A NAME="29"></A>them I gripped him and hurled him from the heavenly threshold till he came 
<A NAME="30"></A>fainting down to earth; yet even this did not relieve my mind from the 
<A NAME="31"></A>incessant anxiety which I felt about noble Hercules whom you and Boreas 
<A NAME="32"></A>had spitefully conveyed beyond the seas to Cos, after suborning the tempests; 
<A NAME="33"></A>but I rescued him, and notwithstanding all his mighty labours I brought 
<A NAME="34"></A>him back again to Argos. I would remind you of this that you may learn 
<A NAME="35"></A>to leave off being so deceitful, and discover how much you are likely to 
<A NAME="36"></A>gain by the embraces out of which you have come here to trick 
<A NAME="37"></A>me."
<A NAME="38"></A><BR><BR>Juno trembled as he spoke, and said, "May heaven above and earth 
<A NAME="39"></A>below be my witnesses, with the waters of the river Styx- and this is the 
<A NAME="40"></A>most solemn oath that a blessed god can take- nay, I swear also by your 
<A NAME="41"></A>own almighty head and by our bridal bed- things over which I could never 
<A NAME="42"></A>possibly perjure myself- that Neptune is not punishing Hector and the Trojans 
<A NAME="43"></A>and helping the Achaeans through any doing of mine; it is all of his own 
<A NAME="44"></A>mere motion because he was sorry to see the Achaeans hard pressed at their 
<A NAME="45"></A>ships: if I were advising him, I should tell him to do as you bid 
<A NAME="46"></A>him."
<A NAME="47"></A><BR><BR>The sire of gods and men smiled and answered, "If you, Juno, were 
<A NAME="48"></A>always to support me when we sit in council of the gods, Neptune, like 
<A NAME="49"></A>it or no, would soon come round to your and my way of thinking. If, then, 
<A NAME="50"></A>you are speaking the truth and mean what you say, go among the rank and 
<A NAME="51"></A>file of the gods, and tell Iris and Apollo lord of the bow, that I want 
<A NAME="52"></A>them- Iris, that she may go to the Achaean host and tell Neptune to leave 
<A NAME="53"></A>off fighting and go home, and Apollo, that he may send Hector again into 
<A NAME="54"></A>battle and give him fresh strength; he will thus forget his present sufferings, 
<A NAME="55"></A>and drive the Achaeans back in confusion till they fall among the ships 
<A NAME="56"></A>of Achilles son of Peleus. Achilles will then send his comrade Patroclus 
<A NAME="57"></A>into battle, and Hector will kill him in front of Ilius after he has slain 
<A NAME="58"></A>many warriors, and among them my own noble son Sarpedon. Achilles will 
<A NAME="59"></A>kill Hector to avenge Patroclus, and from that time I will bring it about 
<A NAME="60"></A>that the Achaeans shall persistently drive the Trojans back till they fulfil 
<A NAME="61"></A>the counsels of Minerva and take Ilius. But I will not stay my anger, nor 
<A NAME="62"></A>permit any god to help the Danaans till I have accomplished the desire 
<A NAME="63"></A>of the son of Peleus, according to the promise I made by bowing my head 
<A NAME="64"></A>on the day when Thetis touched my knees and besought me to give him 
<A NAME="65"></A>honour."
<A NAME="66"></A><BR><BR>Juno heeded his words and went from the heights of Ida to great 
<A NAME="67"></A>Olympus. Swift as the thought of one whose fancy carries him over vast 
<A NAME="68"></A>continents, and he says to himself, "Now I will be here, or there," and 
<A NAME="69"></A>he would have all manner of things- even so swiftly did Juno wing her way 
<A NAME="70"></A>till she came to high Olympus and went in among the gods who were gathered 
<A NAME="71"></A>in the house of Jove. When they saw her they all of them came up to her, 
<A NAME="72"></A>and held out their cups to her by way of greeting. She let the others be, 
<A NAME="73"></A>but took the cup offered her by lovely Themis, who was first to come running 
<A NAME="74"></A>up to her. "Juno," said she, "why are you here? And you seem troubled- 
<A NAME="75"></A>has your husband the son of Saturn been frightening 
<A NAME="76"></A>you?"
<A NAME="77"></A><BR><BR>And Juno answered, "Themis, do not ask me about it. You know what 
<A NAME="78"></A>a proud and cruel disposition my husband has. Lead the gods to table, where 
<A NAME="79"></A>you and all the immortals can hear the wicked designs which he has avowed. 
<A NAME="80"></A>Many a one, mortal and immortal, will be angered by them, however peaceably 
<A NAME="81"></A>he may be feasting now."
<A NAME="82"></A><BR><BR>On this Juno sat down, and the gods were troubled throughout the 
<A NAME="83"></A>house of Jove. Laughter sat on her lips but her brow was furrowed with 
<A NAME="84"></A>care, and she spoke up in a rage. "Fools that we are," she cried, "to be 
<A NAME="85"></A>thus madly angry with Jove; we keep on wanting to go up to him and stay 
<A NAME="86"></A>him by force or by persuasion, but he sits aloof and cares for nobody, 
<A NAME="87"></A>for he knows that he is much stronger than any other of the immortals. 
<A NAME="88"></A>Make the best, therefore, of whatever ills he may choose to send each one 
<A NAME="89"></A>of you; Mars, I take it, has had a taste of them already, for his son Ascalaphus 
<A NAME="90"></A>has fallen in battle- the man whom of all others he loved most dearly and 
<A NAME="91"></A>whose father he owns himself to be."
<A NAME="92"></A><BR><BR>When he heard this Mars smote his two sturdy thighs with the flat 
<A NAME="93"></A>of his hands, and said in anger, "Do not blame me, you gods that dwell 
<A NAME="94"></A>in heaven, if I go to the ships of the Achaeans and avenge the death of 
<A NAME="95"></A>my son, even though it end in my being struck by Jove's lightning and lying 
<A NAME="96"></A>in blood and dust among the corpses."
<A NAME="97"></A><BR><BR>As he spoke he gave orders to yoke his horses Panic and Rout, while 
<A NAME="98"></A>he put on his armour. On this, Jove would have been roused to still more 
<A NAME="99"></A>fierce and implacable enmity against the other immortals, had not Minerva, 
<A NAME="100"></A>ararmed for the safety of the gods, sprung from her seat and hurried outside. 
<A NAME="101"></A>She tore the helmet from his head and the shield from his shoulders, and 
<A NAME="102"></A>she took the bronze spear from his strong hand and set it on one side; 
<A NAME="103"></A>then she said to Mars, "Madman, you are undone; you have ears that hear 
<A NAME="104"></A>not, or you have lost all judgement and understanding; have you not heard 
<A NAME="105"></A>what Juno has said on coming straight from the presence of Olympian Jove? 
<A NAME="106"></A>Do you wish to go through all kinds of suffering before you are brought 
<A NAME="107"></A>back sick and sorry to Olympus, after having caused infinite mischief to 
<A NAME="108"></A>all us others? Jove would instantly leave the Trojans and Achaeans to themselves; 
<A NAME="109"></A>he would come to Olympus to punish us, and would grip us up one after another, 
<A NAME="110"></A>guilty or not guilty. Therefore lay aside your anger for the death of your 
<A NAME="111"></A>son; better men than he have either been killed already or will fall hereafter, 
<A NAME="112"></A>and one cannot protect every one's whole family."
<A NAME="113"></A><BR><BR>With these words she took Mars back to his seat. Meanwhile Juno 
<A NAME="114"></A>called Apollo outside, with Iris the messenger of the gods. "Jove," she 
<A NAME="115"></A>said to them, "desires you to go to him at once on Mt. Ida; when you have 
<A NAME="116"></A>seen him you are to do as he may then bid you."
<A NAME="117"></A><BR><BR>Thereon Juno left them and resumed her seat inside, while Iris 
<A NAME="118"></A>and Apollo made all haste on their way. When they reached many-fountained 
<A NAME="119"></A>Ida, mother of wild beasts, they found Jove seated on topmost Gargarus 
<A NAME="120"></A>with a fragrant cloud encircling his head as with a diadem. They stood 
<A NAME="121"></A>before his presence, and he was pleased with them for having been so quick 
<A NAME="122"></A>in obeying the orders his wife had given them.
<A NAME="123"></A><BR><BR>He spoke to Iris first. "Go," said he, "fleet Iris, tell King Neptune 
<A NAME="124"></A>what I now bid you- and tell him true. Bid him leave off fighting, and 
<A NAME="125"></A>either join the company of the gods, or go down into the sea. If he takes 
<A NAME="126"></A>no heed and disobeys me, let him consider well whether he is strong enough 
<A NAME="127"></A>to hold his own against me if I attack him. I am older and much stronger 
<A NAME="128"></A>than he is; yet he is not afraid to set himself up as on a level with myself, 
<A NAME="129"></A>of whom all the other gods stand in awe."
<A NAME="130"></A><BR><BR>Iris, fleet as the wind, obeyed him, and as the cold hail or snowflakes 
<A NAME="131"></A>that fly from out the clouds before the blast of Boreas, even so did she 
<A NAME="132"></A>wing her way till she came close up to the great shaker of the earth. Then 
<A NAME="133"></A>she said, "I have come, O dark-haired king that holds the world in his 
<A NAME="134"></A>embrace, to bring you a message from Jove. He bids you leave off fighting, 
<A NAME="135"></A>and either join the company of the gods or go down into the sea; if, however, 
<A NAME="136"></A>you take no heed and disobey him, he says he will come down here and fight 
<A NAME="137"></A>you. He would have you keep out of his reach, for he is older and much 
<A NAME="138"></A>stronger than you are, and yet you are not afraid to set yourself up as 
<A NAME="139"></A>on a level with himself, of whom all the other gods stand in 
<A NAME="140"></A>awe."
<A NAME="141"></A><BR><BR>Neptune was very angry and said, "Great heavens! strong as Jove 
<A NAME="142"></A>may be, he has said more than he can do if he has threatened violence against 
<A NAME="143"></A>me, who am of like honour with himself. We were three brothers whom Rhea 
<A NAME="144"></A>bore to Saturn- Jove, myself, and Hades who rules the world below. Heaven 
<A NAME="145"></A>and earth were divided into three parts, and each of us was to have an 
<A NAME="146"></A>equal share. When we cast lots, it fell to me to have my dwelling in the 
<A NAME="147"></A>sea for evermore; Hades took the darkness of the realms under the earth, 
<A NAME="148"></A>while air and sky and clouds were the portion that fell to Jove; but earth 
<A NAME="149"></A>and great Olympus are the common property of all. Therefore I will not 
<A NAME="150"></A>walk as Jove would have me. For all his strength, let him keep to his own 
<A NAME="151"></A>third share and be contented without threatening to lay hands upon me as 
<A NAME="152"></A>though I were nobody. Let him keep his bragging talk for his own sons and 
<A NAME="153"></A>daughters, who must perforce obey him.
<A NAME="154"></A><BR><BR>Iris fleet as the wind then answered, "Am I really, Neptune, to 
<A NAME="155"></A>take this daring and unyielding message to Jove, or will you reconsider 
<A NAME="156"></A>your answer? Sensible people are open to argument, and you know that the 
<A NAME="157"></A>Erinyes always range themselves on the side of the older 
<A NAME="158"></A>person."
<A NAME="159"></A><BR><BR>Neptune answered, "Goddess Iris, your words have been spoken in 
<A NAME="160"></A>season. It is well when a messenger shows so much discretion. Nevertheless 
<A NAME="161"></A>it cuts me to the very heart that any one should rebuke so angrily another 
<A NAME="162"></A>who is his own peer, and of like empire with himself. Now, however, I will 
<A NAME="163"></A>give way in spite of my displeasure; furthermore let me tell you, and I 
<A NAME="164"></A>mean what I say- if contrary to the desire of myself, Minerva driver of 
<A NAME="165"></A>the spoil, Juno, Mercury, and King Vulcan, Jove spares steep Ilius, and 
<A NAME="166"></A>will not let the Achaeans have the great triumph of sacking it, let him 
<A NAME="167"></A>understand that he will incur our implacable resentment."
<A NAME="168"></A><BR><BR>Neptune now left the field to go down under the sea, and sorely 
<A NAME="169"></A>did the Achaeans miss him. Then Jove said to Apollo, "Go, dear Phoebus, 
<A NAME="170"></A>to Hector, for Neptune who holds the earth in his embrace has now gone 
<A NAME="171"></A>down under the sea to avoid the severity of my displeasure. Had he not 
<A NAME="172"></A>done so those gods who are below with Saturn would have come to hear of 
<A NAME="173"></A>the fight between us. It is better for both of us that he should have curbed 
<A NAME="174"></A>his anger and kept out of my reach, for I should have had much trouble 
<A NAME="175"></A>with him. Take, then, your tasselled aegis, and shake it furiously, so 
<A NAME="176"></A>as to set the Achaean heroes in a panic; take, moreover, brave Hector, 
<A NAME="177"></A>O Far-Darter, into your own care, and rouse him to deeds of daring, till 
<A NAME="178"></A>the Achaeans are sent flying back to their ships and to the Hellespont. 
<A NAME="179"></A>From that point I will think it well over, how the Achaeans may have a 
<A NAME="180"></A>respite from their troubles."
<A NAME="181"></A><BR><BR>Apollo obeyed his father's saying, and left the crests of Ida, 
<A NAME="182"></A>flying like a falcon, bane of doves and swiftest of all birds. He found 
<A NAME="183"></A>Hector no longer lying upon the ground, but sitting up, for he had just 
<A NAME="184"></A>come to himself again. He knew those who were about him, and the sweat 
<A NAME="185"></A>and hard breathing had left him from the moment when the will of aegis-bearing 
<A NAME="186"></A>Jove had revived him. Apollo stood beside him and said, "Hector, son of 
<A NAME="187"></A>Priam, why are you so faint, and why are you here away from the others? 
<A NAME="188"></A>Has any mishap befallen you?"
<A NAME="189"></A><BR><BR>Hector in a weak voice answered, "And which, kind sir, of the gods 
<A NAME="190"></A>are you, who now ask me thus? Do you not know that Ajax struck me on the 
<A NAME="191"></A>chest with a stone as I was killing his comrades at the ships of the Achaeans, 
<A NAME="192"></A>and compelled me to leave off fighting? I made sure that this very day 
<A NAME="193"></A>I should breathe my last and go down into the house of 
<A NAME="194"></A>Hades."
<A NAME="195"></A><BR><BR>Then King Apollo said to him, "Take heart; the son of Saturn has 
<A NAME="196"></A>sent you a mighty helper from Ida to stand by you and defend you, even 
<A NAME="197"></A>me, Phoebus Apollo of the golden sword, who have been guardian hitherto 
<A NAME="198"></A>not only of yourself but of your city. Now, therefore, order your horsemen 
<A NAME="199"></A>to drive their chariots to the ships in great multitudes. I will go before 
<A NAME="200"></A>your horses to smooth the way for them, and will turn the Achaeans in 
<A NAME="201"></A>flight."
<A NAME="202"></A><BR><BR>As he spoke he infused great strength into the shepherd of his 
<A NAME="203"></A>people. And as a horse, stabled and full-fed, breaks loose and gallops 
<A NAME="204"></A>gloriously over the plain to the place where he is wont to take his bath 
<A NAME="205"></A>in the river- he tosses his head, and his mane streams over his shoulders 
<A NAME="206"></A>as in all the pride of his strength he flies full speed to the pastures 
<A NAME="207"></A>where the mares are feeding- even so Hector, when he heard what the god 
<A NAME="208"></A>said, urged his horsemen on, and sped forward as fast as his limbs could 
<A NAME="209"></A>take him. As country peasants set their hounds on to a homed stag or wild 
<A NAME="210"></A>goat- he has taken shelter under rock or thicket, and they cannot find 
<A NAME="211"></A>him, but, lo, a bearded lion whom their shouts have roused stands in their 
<A NAME="212"></A>path, and they are in no further humour for the chase- even so the Achaeans 
<A NAME="213"></A>were still charging on in a body, using their swords and spears pointed 
<A NAME="214"></A>at both ends, but when they saw Hector going about among his men they were 
<A NAME="215"></A>afraid, and their hearts fell down into their feet.
<A NAME="216"></A><BR><BR>Then spoke Thoas son of Andraemon, leader of the Aetolians, a man 
<A NAME="217"></A>who could throw a good throw, and who was staunch also in close fight, 
<A NAME="218"></A>while few could surpass him in debate when opinions were divided. He then 
<A NAME="219"></A>with all sincerity and goodwill addressed them thus: "What, in heaven's 
<A NAME="220"></A>name, do I now see? Is it not Hector come to life again? Every one made 
<A NAME="221"></A>sure he had been killed by Ajax son of Telamon, but it seems that one of 
<A NAME="222"></A>the gods has again rescued him. He has killed many of us Danaans already, 
<A NAME="223"></A>and I take it will yet do so, for the hand of Jove must be with him or 
<A NAME="224"></A>he would never dare show himself so masterful in the forefront of the battle. 
<A NAME="225"></A>Now, therefore, let us all do as I say; let us order the main body of our 
<A NAME="226"></A>forces to fall back upon the ships, but let those of us who profess to 
<A NAME="227"></A>be the flower of the army stand firm, and see whether we cannot hold Hector 
<A NAME="228"></A>back at the point of our spears as soon as he comes near us; I conceive 
<A NAME="229"></A>that he will then think better of it before he tries to charge into the 
<A NAME="230"></A>press of the Danaans."
<A NAME="231"></A><BR><BR>Thus did he speak, and they did even as he had said. Those who 
<A NAME="232"></A>were about Ajax and King Idomeneus, the followers moreover of Teucer, Meriones, 
<A NAME="233"></A>and Meges peer of Mars called all their best men about them and sustained 
<A NAME="234"></A>the fight against Hector and the Trojans, but the main body fell back upon 
<A NAME="235"></A>the ships of the Achaeans.
<A NAME="236"></A><BR><BR>The Trojans pressed forward in a dense body, with Hector striding 
<A NAME="237"></A>on at their head. Before him went Phoebus Apollo shrouded in cloud about 
<A NAME="238"></A>his shoulders. He bore aloft the terrible aegis with its shaggy fringe, 
<A NAME="239"></A>which Vulcan the smith had given Jove to strike terror into the hearts 
<A NAME="240"></A>of men. With this in his hand he led on the Trojans.
<A NAME="241"></A><BR><BR>The Argives held together and stood their ground. The cry of battle 
<A NAME="242"></A>rose high from either side, and the arrows flew from the bowstrings. Many 
<A NAME="243"></A>a spear sped from strong hands and fastened in the bodies of many a valiant 
<A NAME="244"></A>warrior, while others fell to earth midway, before they could taste of 
<A NAME="245"></A>man's fair flesh and glut themselves with blood. So long as Phoebus Apollo 
<A NAME="246"></A>held his aegis quietly and without shaking it, the weapons on either side 
<A NAME="247"></A>took effect and the people fell, but when he shook it straight in the face 
<A NAME="248"></A>of the Danaans and raised his mighty battle-cry their hearts fainted within 
<A NAME="249"></A>them and they forgot their former prowess. As when two wild beasts spring 
<A NAME="250"></A>in the dead of night on a herd of cattle or a large flock of sheep when 
<A NAME="251"></A>the herdsman is not there- even so were the Danaans struck helpless, for 
<A NAME="252"></A>Apollo filled them with panic and gave victory to Hector and the 
<A NAME="253"></A>Trojans.
<A NAME="254"></A><BR><BR>The fight then became more scattered and they killed one another 
<A NAME="255"></A>where they best could. Hector killed Stichius and Arcesilaus, the one, 
<A NAME="256"></A>leader of the Boeotians, and the other, friend and comrade of Menestheus. 
<A NAME="257"></A>Aeneas killed Medon and Iasus. The first was bastard son to Oileus, and 
<A NAME="258"></A>brother to Ajax, but he lived in Phylace away from his own country, for 
<A NAME="259"></A>he had killed a man, a kinsman of his stepmother Eriopis whom Oileus had 
<A NAME="260"></A>married. Iasus had become a leader of the Athenians, and was son of Sphelus 
<A NAME="261"></A>the son of Boucolos. Polydamas killed Mecisteus, and Polites Echius, in 
<A NAME="262"></A>the front of the battle, while Agenor slew Clonius. Paris struck Deiochus 
<A NAME="263"></A>from behind in the lower part of the shoulder, as he was flying among the 
<A NAME="264"></A>foremost, and the point of the spear went clean through 
<A NAME="265"></A>him.
<A NAME="266"></A><BR><BR>While they were spoiling these heroes of their armour, the Achaeans 
<A NAME="267"></A>were flying pellmell to the trench and the set stakes, and were forced 
<A NAME="268"></A>back within their wall. Hector then cried out to the Trojans, "Forward 
<A NAME="269"></A>to the ships, and let the spoils be. If I see any man keeping back on the 
<A NAME="270"></A>other side the wall away from the ships I will have him killed: his kinsmen 
<A NAME="271"></A>and kinswomen shall not give him his dues of fire, but dogs shall tear 
<A NAME="272"></A>him in pieces in front of our city."
<A NAME="273"></A><BR><BR>As he spoke he laid his whip about his horses' shoulders and called 
<A NAME="274"></A>to the Trojans throughout their ranks; the Trojans shouted with a cry that 
<A NAME="275"></A>rent the air, and kept their horses neck and neck with his own. Phoebus 
<A NAME="276"></A>Apollo went before, and kicked down the banks of the deep trench into its 
<A NAME="277"></A>middle so as to make a great broad bridge, as broad as the throw of a spear 
<A NAME="278"></A>when a man is trying his strength. The Trojan battalions poured over the 
<A NAME="279"></A>bridge, and Apollo with his redoubtable aegis led the way. He kicked down 
<A NAME="280"></A>the wall of the Achaeans as easily as a child who playing on the sea-shore 
<A NAME="281"></A>has built a house of sand and then kicks it down again and destroys it- 
<A NAME="282"></A>even so did you, O Apollo, shed toil and trouble upon the Argives, filling 
<A NAME="283"></A>them with panic and confusion.
<A NAME="284"></A><BR><BR>Thus then were the Achaeans hemmed in at their ships, calling out 
<A NAME="285"></A>to one another and raising their hands with loud cries every man to heaven. 
<A NAME="286"></A>Nestor of Gerene, tower of strength to the Achaeans, lifted up his hands 
<A NAME="287"></A>to the starry firmament of heaven, and prayed more fervently than any of 
<A NAME="288"></A>them. "Father Jove," said he, "if ever any one in wheat-growing Argos burned 
<A NAME="289"></A>you fat thigh-bones of sheep or heifer and prayed that he might return 
<A NAME="290"></A>safely home, whereon you bowed your head to him in assent, bear it in mind 
<A NAME="291"></A>now, and suffer not the Trojans to triumph thus over the 
<A NAME="292"></A>Achaeans."
<A NAME="293"></A><BR><BR>All counselling Jove thundered loudly in answer to die prayer of 
<A NAME="294"></A>the aged son of Neleus. When the heard Jove thunder they flung themselves 
<A NAME="295"></A>yet more fiercely on the Achaeans. As a wave breaking over the bulwarks 
<A NAME="296"></A>of a ship when the sea runs high before a gale- for it is the force of 
<A NAME="297"></A>the wind that makes the waves so great- even so did the Trojans spring 
<A NAME="298"></A>over the wall with a shout, and drive their chariots onwards. The two sides 
<A NAME="299"></A>fought with their double-pointed spears in hand-to-hand encounter-the Trojans 
<A NAME="300"></A>from their chariots, and the Achaeans climbing up into their ships and 
<A NAME="301"></A>wielding the long pikes that were lying on the decks ready for use in a 
<A NAME="302"></A>sea-fight, jointed and shod with bronze.
<A NAME="303"></A><BR><BR>Now Patroclus, so long as the Achaeans and Trojans were fighting 
<A NAME="304"></A>about the wall, but were not yet within it and at the ships, remained sitting 
<A NAME="305"></A>in the tent of good Eurypylus, entertaining him with his conversation and 
<A NAME="306"></A>spreading herbs over his wound to ease his pain. When, however, he saw 
<A NAME="307"></A>the Trojans swarming through the breach in the wall, while the Achaeans 
<A NAME="308"></A>were clamouring and struck with panic, he cried aloud, and smote his two 
<A NAME="309"></A>thighs with the flat of his hands. "Eurypylus," said he in his dismay, 
<A NAME="310"></A>"I know you want me badly, but I cannot stay with you any longer, for there 
<A NAME="311"></A>is hard fighting going on; a servant shall take care of you now, for I 
<A NAME="312"></A>must make all speed to Achilles, and induce him to fight if I can; who 
<A NAME="313"></A>knows but with heaven's help I may persuade him. A man does well to listen 
<A NAME="314"></A>to the advice of a friend."
<A NAME="315"></A><BR><BR>When he had thus spoken he went his way. The Achaeans stood firm 
<A NAME="316"></A>and resisted the attack of the Trojans, yet though these were fewer in 
<A NAME="317"></A>number, they could not drive them back from the ships, neither could the 
<A NAME="318"></A>Trojans break the Achaean ranks and make their way in among the tents and 
<A NAME="319"></A>ships. As a carpenter's line gives a true edge to a piece of ship's timber, 
<A NAME="320"></A>in the hand of some skilled workman whom Minerva has instructed in all 
<A NAME="321"></A>kinds of useful arts- even so level was the issue of the fight between 
<A NAME="322"></A>the two sides, as they fought some round one and some round 
<A NAME="323"></A>another.
<A NAME="324"></A><BR><BR>Hector made straight for Ajax, and the two fought fiercely about 
<A NAME="325"></A>the same ship. Hector could not force Ajax back and fire the ship, nor 
<A NAME="326"></A>yet could Ajax drive Hector from the spot to which heaven had brought 
<A NAME="327"></A>him.
<A NAME="328"></A><BR><BR>Then Ajax struck Caletor son of Clytius in the chest with a spear 
<A NAME="329"></A>as he was bringing fire towards the ship. He fell heavily to the ground 
<A NAME="330"></A>and the torch dropped from his hand. When Hector saw his cousin fallen 
<A NAME="331"></A>in front of the ship he shouted to the Trojans and Lycians saying, "Trojans, 
<A NAME="332"></A>Lycians, and Dardanians good in close fight, bate not a jot, but rescue 
<A NAME="333"></A>the son of Clytius lest the Achaeans strip him of his armour now that he 
<A NAME="334"></A>has fallen."
<A NAME="335"></A><BR><BR>He then aimed a spear at Ajax, and missed him, but he hit Lycophron 
<A NAME="336"></A>a follower of Ajax, who came from Cythera, but was living with Ajax inasmuch 
<A NAME="337"></A>as he had killed a man among the Cythereans. Hector's spear struck him 
<A NAME="338"></A>on the head below the ear, and he fell headlong from the ship's prow on 
<A NAME="339"></A>to the ground with no life left in him. Ajax shook with rage and said to 
<A NAME="340"></A>his brother, "Teucer, my good fellow, our trusty comrade the son of Mastor 
<A NAME="341"></A>has fallen, he came to live with us from Cythera and whom we honoured as 
<A NAME="342"></A>much as our own parents. Hector has just killed him; fetch your deadly 
<A NAME="343"></A>arrows at once and the bow which Phoebus Apollo gave 
<A NAME="344"></A>you."
<A NAME="345"></A><BR><BR>Teucer heard him and hastened towards him with his bow and quiver 
<A NAME="346"></A>in his hands. Forthwith he showered his arrows on the Trojans, and hit 
<A NAME="347"></A>Cleitus the son of Pisenor, comrade of Polydamas the noble son of Panthous, 
<A NAME="348"></A>with the reins in his hands as he was attending to his horses; he was in 
<A NAME="349"></A>the middle of the very thickest part of the fight, doing good service to 
<A NAME="350"></A>Hector and the Trojans, but evil had now come upon him, and not one of 
<A NAME="351"></A>those who were fain to do so could avert it, for the arrow struck him on 
<A NAME="352"></A>the back of the neck. He fell from his chariot and his horses shook the 
<A NAME="353"></A>empty car as they swerved aside. King Polydamas saw what had happened, 
<A NAME="354"></A>and was the first to come up to the horses; he gave them in charge to Astynous 
<A NAME="355"></A>son of Protiaon, and ordered him to look on, and to keep the horses near 
<A NAME="356"></A>at hand. He then went back and took his place in the front 
<A NAME="357"></A>ranks.
<A NAME="358"></A><BR><BR>Teucer then aimed another arrow at Hector, and there would have 
<A NAME="359"></A>been no more fighting at the ships if he had hit him and killed him then 
<A NAME="360"></A>and there: Jove, however, who kept watch over Hector, had his eyes on Teucer, 
<A NAME="361"></A>and deprived him of his triumph, by breaking his bowstring for him just 
<A NAME="362"></A>as he was drawing it and about to take his aim; on this the arrow went 
<A NAME="363"></A>astray and the bow fell from his hands. Teucer shook with anger and said 
<A NAME="364"></A>to his brother, "Alas, see how heaven thwarts us in all we do; it has broken 
<A NAME="365"></A>my bowstring and snatched the bow from my hand, though I strung it this 
<A NAME="366"></A>selfsame morning that it might serve me for many an 
<A NAME="367"></A>arrow."
<A NAME="368"></A><BR><BR>Ajax son of Telamon answered, "My good fellow, let your bow and 
<A NAME="369"></A>your arrows be, for Jove has made them useless in order to spite the Danaans. 
<A NAME="370"></A>Take your spear, lay your shield upon your shoulder, and both fight the 
<A NAME="371"></A>Trojans yourself and urge others to do so. They may be successful for the 
<A NAME="372"></A>moment but if we fight as we ought they will find it a hard matter to take 
<A NAME="373"></A>the ships."
<A NAME="374"></A><BR><BR>Teucer then took his bow and put it by in his tent. He hung a shield 
<A NAME="375"></A>four hides thick about his shoulders, and on his comely head he set his 
<A NAME="376"></A>helmet well wrought with a crest of horse-hair that nodded menacingly above 
<A NAME="377"></A>it; he grasped his redoubtable bronze-shod spear, and forthwith he was 
<A NAME="378"></A>by the side of Ajax.
<A NAME="379"></A><BR><BR>When Hector saw that Teucer's bow was of no more use to him, he 
<A NAME="380"></A>shouted out to the Trojans and Lycians, "Trojans, Lycians, and Dardanians 
<A NAME="381"></A>good in close fight, be men, my friends, and show your mettle here at the 
<A NAME="382"></A>ships, for I see the weapon of one of their chieftains made useless by 
<A NAME="383"></A>the hand of Jove. It is easy to see when Jove is helping people and means 
<A NAME="384"></A>to help them still further, or again when he is bringing them down and 
<A NAME="385"></A>will do nothing for them; he is now on our side, and is going against the 
<A NAME="386"></A>Argives. Therefore swarm round the ships and fight. If any of you is struck 
<A NAME="387"></A>by spear or sword and loses his life, let him die; he dies with honour 
<A NAME="388"></A>who dies fighting for his country; and he will leave his wife and children 
<A NAME="389"></A>safe behind him, with his house and allotment unplundered if only the Achaeans 
<A NAME="390"></A>can be driven back to their own land, they and their 
<A NAME="391"></A>ships."
<A NAME="392"></A><BR><BR>With these words he put heart and soul into them all. Ajax on the 
<A NAME="393"></A>other side exhorted his comrades saying, "Shame on you Argives, we are 
<A NAME="394"></A>now utterly undone, unless we can save ourselves by driving the enemy from 
<A NAME="395"></A>our ships. Do you think, if Hector takes them, that you will be able to 
<A NAME="396"></A>get home by land? Can you not hear him cheering on his whole host to fire 
<A NAME="397"></A>our fleet, and bidding them remember that they are not at a dance but in 
<A NAME="398"></A>battle? Our only course is to fight them with might and main; we had better 
<A NAME="399"></A>chance it, life or death, once for all, than fight long and without issue 
<A NAME="400"></A>hemmed in at our ships by worse men than ourselves."
<A NAME="401"></A><BR><BR>With these words he put life and soul into them all. Hector then 
<A NAME="402"></A>killed Schedius son of Perimedes, leader of the Phoceans, and Ajax killed 
<A NAME="403"></A>Laodamas captain of foot soldiers and son to Antenor. Polydamas killed 
<A NAME="404"></A>Otus of Cyllene a comrade of the son of Phyleus and chief of the proud 
<A NAME="405"></A>Epeans. When Meges saw this he sprang upon him, but Polydamas crouched 
<A NAME="406"></A>down, and he missed him, for Apollo would not suffer the son of Panthous 
<A NAME="407"></A>to fall in battle; but the spear hit Croesmus in the middle of his chest, 
<A NAME="408"></A>whereon he fell heavily to the ground, and Meges stripped him of his armour. 
<A NAME="409"></A>At that moment the valiant soldier Dolops son of Lampus sprang upon Lampus 
<A NAME="410"></A>was son of Laomedon and for his valour, while his son Dolops was versed 
<A NAME="411"></A>in all the ways of war. He then struck the middle of the son of Phyleus' 
<A NAME="412"></A>shield with his spear, setting on him at close quarters, but his good corslet 
<A NAME="413"></A>made with plates of metal saved him; Phyleus had brought it from Ephyra 
<A NAME="414"></A>and the river Selleis, where his host, King Euphetes, had given it him 
<A NAME="415"></A>to wear in battle and protect him. It now served to save the life of his 
<A NAME="416"></A>son. Then Meges struck the topmost crest of Dolops's bronze helmet with 
<A NAME="417"></A>his spear and tore away its plume of horse-hair, so that all newly dyed 
<A NAME="418"></A>with scarlet as it was it tumbled down into the dust. While he was still 
<A NAME="419"></A>fighting and confident of victory, Menelaus came up to help Meges, and 
<A NAME="420"></A>got by the side of Dolops unperceived; he then speared him in the shoulder, 
<A NAME="421"></A>from behind, and the point, driven so furiously, went through into his 
<A NAME="422"></A>chest, whereon he fell headlong. The two then made towards him to strip 
<A NAME="423"></A>him of his armour, but Hector called on all his brothers for help, and 
<A NAME="424"></A>he especially upbraided brave Melanippus son of Hiketaon, who erewhile 
<A NAME="425"></A>used to pasture his herds of cattle in Percote before the war broke out; 
<A NAME="426"></A>but when the ships of the Danaans came, he went back to Ilius, where he 
<A NAME="427"></A>was eminent among the Trojans, and lived near Priam who treated him as 
<A NAME="428"></A>one of his own sons. Hector now rebuked him and said, "Why, Melanippus, 
<A NAME="429"></A>are we thus remiss? do you take no note of the death of your kinsman, and 
<A NAME="430"></A>do you not see how they are trying to take Dolops's armour? Follow me; 
<A NAME="431"></A>there must be no fighting the Argives from a distance now, but we must 
<A NAME="432"></A>do so in close combat till either we kill them or they take the high wall 
<A NAME="433"></A>of Ilius and slay her people."
<A NAME="434"></A><BR><BR>He led on as he spoke, and the hero Melanippus followed after. 
<A NAME="435"></A>Meanwhile Ajax son of Telamon was cheering on the Argives. "My friends," 
<A NAME="436"></A>he cried, "be men, and fear dishonour; quit yourselves in battle so as 
<A NAME="437"></A>to win respect from one another. Men who respect each other's good opinion 
<A NAME="438"></A>are less likely to be killed than those who do not, but in flight there 
<A NAME="439"></A>is neither gain nor glory."
<A NAME="440"></A><BR><BR>Thus did he exhort men who were already bent upon driving back 
<A NAME="441"></A>the Trojans. They laid his words to heart and hedged the ships as with 
<A NAME="442"></A>a wall of bronze, while Jove urged on the Trojans. Menelaus of the loud 
<A NAME="443"></A>battle-cry urged Antilochus on. "Antilochus," said he, "you are young and 
<A NAME="444"></A>there is none of the Achaeans more fleet of foot or more valiant than you 
<A NAME="445"></A>are. See if you cannot spring upon some Trojan and kill 
<A NAME="446"></A>him."
<A NAME="447"></A><BR><BR>He hurried away when he had thus spurred Antilochus, who at once 
<A NAME="448"></A>darted out from the front ranks and aimed a spear, after looking carefully 
<A NAME="449"></A>round him. The Trojans fell back as he threw, and the dart did not speed 
<A NAME="450"></A>from his hand without effect, for it struck Melanippus the proud son of 
<A NAME="451"></A>Hiketaon in the breast by the nipple as he was coming forward, and his 
<A NAME="452"></A>armour rang rattling round him as he fell heavily to the ground. Antilochus 
<A NAME="453"></A>sprang upon him as a dog springs on a fawn which a hunter has hit as it 
<A NAME="454"></A>was breaking away from its covert, and killed it. Even so, O Melanippus, 
<A NAME="455"></A>did stalwart Antilochus spring upon you to strip you of your armour; but 
<A NAME="456"></A>noble Hector marked him, and came running up to him through the thick of 
<A NAME="457"></A>the battle. Antilochus, brave soldier though he was, would not stay to 
<A NAME="458"></A>face him, but fled like some savage creature which knows it has done wrong, 
<A NAME="459"></A>and flies, when it has killed a dog or a man who is herding his cattle, 
<A NAME="460"></A>before a body of men can be gathered to attack it. Even so did the son 
<A NAME="461"></A>of Nestor fly, and the Trojans and Hector with a cry that rent the air 
<A NAME="462"></A>showered their weapons after him; nor did he turn round and stay his flight 
<A NAME="463"></A>till he had reached his comrades.
<A NAME="464"></A><BR><BR>The Trojans, fierce as lions, were still rushing on towards the 
<A NAME="465"></A>ships in fulfilment of the behests of Jove who kept spurring them on to 
<A NAME="466"></A>new deeds of daring, while he deadened the courage of the Argives and defeated 
<A NAME="467"></A>them by encouraging the Trojans. For he meant giving glory to Hector son 
<A NAME="468"></A>of Priam, and letting him throw fire upon the ships, till he had fulfilled 
<A NAME="469"></A>the unrighteous prayer that Thetis had made him; Jove, therefore, bided 
<A NAME="470"></A>his time till he should see the glare of a blazing ship. From that hour 
<A NAME="471"></A>he was about so to order that the Trojans should be driven back from the 
<A NAME="472"></A>ships and to vouchsafe glory to the Achaeans. With this purpose he inspired 
<A NAME="473"></A>Hector son of Priam, who was cager enough already, to assail the ships. 
<A NAME="474"></A>His fury was as that of Mars, or as when a fire is raging in the glades 
<A NAME="475"></A>of some dense forest upon the mountains; he foamed at the mouth, his eyes 
<A NAME="476"></A>glared under his terrible eye-brows, and his helmet quivered on his temples 
<A NAME="477"></A>by reason of the fury with which he fought. Jove from heaven was with him, 
<A NAME="478"></A>and though he was but one against many, vouchsafed him victory and glory; 
<A NAME="479"></A>for he was doomed to an early death, and already Pallas Minerva was hurrying 
<A NAME="480"></A>on the hour of his destruction at the hands of the son of Peleus. Now, 
<A NAME="481"></A>however, he kept trying to break the ranks of the enemy wherever he could 
<A NAME="482"></A>see them thickest, and in the goodliest armour; but do what he might he 
<A NAME="483"></A>could not break through them, for they stood as a tower foursquare, or 
<A NAME="484"></A>as some high cliff rising from the grey sea that braves the anger of the 
<A NAME="485"></A>gale, and of the waves that thunder up against it. He fell upon them like 
<A NAME="486"></A>flames of fire from every quarter. As when a wave, raised mountain high 
<A NAME="487"></A>by wind and storm, breaks over a ship and covers it deep in foam, the fierce 
<A NAME="488"></A>winds roar against the mast, the hearts of the sailors fail them for fear, 
<A NAME="489"></A>and they are saved but by a very little from destruction- even so were 
<A NAME="490"></A>the hearts of the Achaeans fainting within them. Or as a savage lion attacking 
<A NAME="491"></A>a herd of cows while they are feeding by thousands in the low-lying meadows 
<A NAME="492"></A>by some wide-watered shore- the herdsman is at his wit's end how to protect 
<A NAME="493"></A>his herd and keeps going about now in the van and now in the rear of his 
<A NAME="494"></A>cattle, while the lion springs into the thick of them and fastens on a 
<A NAME="495"></A>cow so that they all tremble for fear- even so were the Achaeans utterly 
<A NAME="496"></A>panic-stricken by Hector and father Jove. Nevertheless Hector only killed 
<A NAME="497"></A>Periphetes of Mycenae; he was son of Copreus who was wont to take the orders 
<A NAME="498"></A>of King Eurystheus to mighty Hercules, but the son was a far better man 
<A NAME="499"></A>than the father in every way; he was fleet of foot, a valiant warrior, 
<A NAME="500"></A>and in understanding ranked among the foremost men of Mycenae. He it was 
<A NAME="501"></A>who then afforded Hector a triumph, for as he was turning back he stumbled 
<A NAME="502"></A>against the rim of his shield which reached his feet, and served to keep 
<A NAME="503"></A>the javelins off him. He tripped against this and fell face upward, his 
<A NAME="504"></A>helmet ringing loudly about his head as he did so. Hector saw him fall 
<A NAME="505"></A>and ran up to him; he then thrust a spear into his chest, and killed him 
<A NAME="506"></A>close to his own comrades. These, for all their sorrow, could not help 
<A NAME="507"></A>him for they were themselves terribly afraid of Hector.
<A NAME="508"></A><BR><BR>They had now reached the ships and the prows of those that had 
<A NAME="509"></A>been drawn up first were on every side of them, but the Trojans came pouring 
<A NAME="510"></A>after them. The Argives were driven back from the first row of ships, but 
<A NAME="511"></A>they made a stand by their tents without being broken up and scattered; 
<A NAME="512"></A>shame and fear restrained them. They kept shouting incessantly to one another, 
<A NAME="513"></A>and Nestor of Gerene, tower of strength to the Achaeans, was loudest in 
<A NAME="514"></A>imploring every man by his parents, and beseeching him to stand 
<A NAME="515"></A>firm.
<A NAME="516"></A><BR><BR>"Be men, my friends," he cried, "and respect one another's good 
<A NAME="517"></A>opinion. Think, all of you, on your children, your wives, your property, 
<A NAME="518"></A>and your parents whether these be alive or dead. On their behalf though 
<A NAME="519"></A>they are not here, I implore you to stand firm, and not to turn in 
<A NAME="520"></A>flight."
<A NAME="521"></A><BR><BR>With these words he put heart and soul into them all. Minerva lifted 
<A NAME="522"></A>the thick veil of darkness from their eyes, and much light fell upon them, 
<A NAME="523"></A>alike on the side of the ships and on that where the fight was raging. 
<A NAME="524"></A>They could see Hector and all his men, both those in the rear who were 
<A NAME="525"></A>taking no part in the battle, and those who were fighting by the 
<A NAME="526"></A>ships.
<A NAME="527"></A><BR><BR>Ajax could not bring himself to retreat along with the rest, but 
<A NAME="528"></A>strode from deck to deck with a great sea-pike in his hands twelve cubits 
<A NAME="529"></A>long and jointed with rings. As a man skilled in feats of horsemanship 
<A NAME="530"></A>couples four horses together and comes tearing full speed along the public 
<A NAME="531"></A>way from the country into some large town- many both men and women marvel 
<A NAME="532"></A>as they see him for he keeps all the time changing his horse, springing 
<A NAME="533"></A>from one to another without ever missing his feet while the horses are 
<A NAME="534"></A>at a gallop- even so did Ajax go striding from one ship's deck to another, 
<A NAME="535"></A>and his voice went up into the heavens. He kept on shouting his orders 
<A NAME="536"></A>to the Danaans and exhorting them to defend their ships and tents; neither 
<A NAME="537"></A>did Hector remain within the main body of the Trojan warriors, but as a 
<A NAME="538"></A>dun eagle swoops down upon a flock of wild-fowl feeding near a river-geese, 
<A NAME="539"></A>it may be, or cranes, or long-necked swans- even so did Hector make straight 
<A NAME="540"></A>for a dark-prowed ship, rushing right towards it; for Jove with his mighty 
<A NAME="541"></A>hand impelled him forward, and roused his people to follow 
<A NAME="542"></A>him.
<A NAME="543"></A><BR><BR>And now the battle again raged furiously at the ships. You would 
<A NAME="544"></A>have thought the men were coming on fresh and unwearied, so fiercely did 
<A NAME="545"></A>they fight; and this was the mind in which they were- the Achaeans did 
<A NAME="546"></A>not believe they should escape destruction but thought themselves doomed, 
<A NAME="547"></A>while there was not a Trojan but his heart beat high with the hope of firing 
<A NAME="548"></A>the ships and putting the Achaean heroes to the sword.
<A NAME="549"></A><BR><BR>Thus were the two sides minded. Then Hector seized the stern of 
<A NAME="550"></A>the good ship that had brought Protesilaus to Troy, but never bore him 
<A NAME="551"></A>back to his native land. Round this ship there raged a close hand-to-hand 
<A NAME="552"></A>fight between Danaans and Trojans. They did not fight at a distance with 
<A NAME="553"></A>bows and javelins, but with one mind hacked at one another in close combat 
<A NAME="554"></A>with their mighty swords and spears pointed at both ends; they fought moreover 
<A NAME="555"></A>with keen battle-axes and with hatchets. Many a good stout blade hilted 
<A NAME="556"></A>and scabbarded with iron, fell from hand or shoulder as they fought, and 
<A NAME="557"></A>the earth ran red with blood. Hector, when he had seized the ship, would 
<A NAME="558"></A>not loose his hold but held on to its curved stern and shouted to the Trojans, 
<A NAME="559"></A>"Bring fire, and raise the battle-cry all of you with a single voice. Now 
<A NAME="560"></A>has Jove vouchsafed us a day that will pay us for all the rest; this day 
<A NAME="561"></A>we shall take the ships which came hither against heaven's will, and which 
<A NAME="562"></A>have caused us such infinite suffering through the cowardice of our councillors, 
<A NAME="563"></A>who when I would have done battle at the ships held me back and forbade 
<A NAME="564"></A>the host to follow me; if Jove did then indeed warp our judgements, himself 
<A NAME="565"></A>now commands me and cheers me on."
<A NAME="566"></A><BR><BR>As he spoke thus the Trojans sprang yet more fiercely on the Achaeans, 
<A NAME="567"></A>and Ajax no longer held his ground, for he was overcome by the darts that 
<A NAME="568"></A>were flung at him, and made sure that he was doomed. Therefore he left 
<A NAME="569"></A>the raised deck at the stern, and stepped back on to the seven-foot bench 
<A NAME="570"></A>of the oarsmen. Here he stood on the look-out, and with his spear held 
<A NAME="571"></A>back Trojan whom he saw bringing fire to the ships. All the time he kept 
<A NAME="572"></A>on shouting at the top of his voice and exhorting the Danaans. "My friends," 
<A NAME="573"></A>he cried, "Danaan heroes, servants of Mars, be men my friends, and fight 
<A NAME="574"></A>with might and with main. Can we hope to find helpers hereafter, or a wall 
<A NAME="575"></A>to shield us more surely than the one we have? There is no strong city 
<A NAME="576"></A>within reach, whence we may draw fresh forces to turn the scales in our 
<A NAME="577"></A>favour. We are on the plain of the armed Trojans with the sea behind us, 
<A NAME="578"></A>and far from our own country. Our salvation, therefore, is in the might 
<A NAME="579"></A>of our hands and in hard fighting."
<A NAME="580"></A><BR><BR>As he spoke he wielded his spear with still greater fury, and when 
<A NAME="581"></A>any Trojan made towards the ships with fire at Hector's bidding, he would 
<A NAME="582"></A>be on the look-out for him, and drive at him with his long spear. Twelve 
<A NAME="583"></A>men did he thus kill in hand-to-hand fight before the 
<A NAME="584"></A>ships.
