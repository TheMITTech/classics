<A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A>Thus did they make their moan throughout the city, while the Achaeans when 
<A NAME="11"></A>they reached the Hellespont went back every man to his own ship. But Achilles 
<A NAME="12"></A>would not let the Myrmidons go, and spoke to his brave comrades saying, 
<A NAME="13"></A>"Myrmidons, famed horsemen and my own trusted friends, not yet, forsooth, 
<A NAME="14"></A>let us unyoke, but with horse and chariot draw near to the body and mourn 
<A NAME="15"></A>Patroclus, in due honour to the dead. When we have had full comfort of 
<A NAME="16"></A>lamentation we will unyoke our horses and take supper all of us 
<A NAME="17"></A>here."
<A NAME="18"></A><BR><BR>On this they all joined in a cry of wailing and Achilles led them 
<A NAME="19"></A>in their lament. Thrice did they drive their chariots all sorrowing round 
<A NAME="20"></A>the body, and Thetis stirred within them a still deeper yearning. The sands 
<A NAME="21"></A>of the seashore and the men's armour were wet with their weeping, so great 
<A NAME="22"></A>a minister of fear was he whom they had lost. Chief in all their mourning 
<A NAME="23"></A>was the son of Peleus: he laid his bloodstained hand on the breast of his 
<A NAME="24"></A>friend. "Fare well," he cried, "Patroclus, even in the house of Hades. 
<A NAME="25"></A>I will now do all that I erewhile promised you; I will drag Hector hither 
<A NAME="26"></A>and let dogs devour him raw; twelve noble sons of Trojans will I also slay 
<A NAME="27"></A>before your pyre to avenge you."
<A NAME="28"></A><BR><BR>As he spoke he treated the body of noble Hector with contumely, 
<A NAME="29"></A>laying it at full length in the dust beside the bier of Patroclus. The 
<A NAME="30"></A>others then put off every man his armour, took the horses from their chariots, 
<A NAME="31"></A>and seated themselves in great multitude by the ship of the fleet descendant 
<A NAME="32"></A>of Aeacus, who thereon feasted them with an abundant funeral banquet. Many 
<A NAME="33"></A>a goodly ox, with many a sheep and bleating goat did they butcher and cut 
<A NAME="34"></A>up; many a tusked boar moreover, fat and well-fed, did they singe and set 
<A NAME="35"></A>to roast in the flames of Vulcan; and rivulets of blood flowed all round 
<A NAME="36"></A>the place where the body was lying.
<A NAME="37"></A><BR><BR>Then the princes of the Achaeans took the son of Peleus to Agamemnon, 
<A NAME="38"></A>but hardly could they persuade him to come with them, so wroth was he for 
<A NAME="39"></A>the death of his comrade. As soon as they reached Agamemnon's tent they 
<A NAME="40"></A>told the serving-men to set a large tripod over the fire in case they might 
<A NAME="41"></A>persuade the son of Peleus 'to wash the clotted gore from this body, but 
<A NAME="42"></A>he denied them sternly, and swore it with a solemn oath, saying, "Nay, 
<A NAME="43"></A>by King Jove, first and mightiest of all gods, it is not meet that water 
<A NAME="44"></A>should touch my body, till I have laid Patroclus on the flames, have built 
<A NAME="45"></A>him a barrow, and shaved my head- for so long as I live no such second 
<A NAME="46"></A>sorrow shall ever draw nigh me. Now, therefore, let us do all that this 
<A NAME="47"></A>sad festival demands, but at break of day, King Agamemnon, bid your men 
<A NAME="48"></A>bring wood, and provide all else that the dead may duly take into the realm 
<A NAME="49"></A>of darkness; the fire shall thus burn him out of our sight the sooner, 
<A NAME="50"></A>and the people shall turn again to their own labours."
<A NAME="51"></A><BR><BR>Thus did he speak, and they did even as he had said. They made 
<A NAME="52"></A>haste to prepare the meal, they ate, and every man had his full share so 
<A NAME="53"></A>that all were satisfied. As soon as they had had had enough to eat and 
<A NAME="54"></A>drink, the others went to their rest each in his own tent, but the son 
<A NAME="55"></A>of Peleus lay grieving among his Myrmidons by the shore of the sounding 
<A NAME="56"></A>sea, in an open place where the waves came surging in one after another. 
<A NAME="57"></A>Here a very deep slumber took hold upon him and eased the burden of his 
<A NAME="58"></A>sorrows, for his limbs were weary with chasing Hector round windy Ilius. 
<A NAME="59"></A>Presently the sad spirit of Patroclus drew near him, like what he had been 
<A NAME="60"></A>in stature, voice, and the light of his beaming eyes, clad, too, as he 
<A NAME="61"></A>had been clad in life. The spirit hovered over his head and 
<A NAME="62"></A>said-
<A NAME="63"></A><BR><BR>"You sleep, Achilles, and have forgotten me; you loved me living, 
<A NAME="64"></A>but now that I am dead you think for me no further. Bury me with all speed 
<A NAME="65"></A>that I may pass the gates of Hades; the ghosts, vain shadows of men that 
<A NAME="66"></A>can labour no more, drive me away from them; they will not yet suffer me 
<A NAME="67"></A>to join those that are beyond the river, and I wander all desolate by the 
<A NAME="68"></A>wide gates of the house of Hades. Give me now your hand I pray you, for 
<A NAME="69"></A>when you have once given me my dues of fire, never shall I again come forth 
<A NAME="70"></A>out of the house of Hades. Nevermore shall we sit apart and take sweet 
<A NAME="71"></A>counsel among the living; the cruel fate which was my birth-right has yawned 
<A NAME="72"></A>its wide jaws around me- nay, you too Achilles, peer of gods, are doomed 
<A NAME="73"></A>to die beneath the wall of the noble Trojans.
<A NAME="74"></A><BR><BR>"One prayer more will I make you, if you will grant it; let not 
<A NAME="75"></A>my bones be laid apart from yours, Achilles, but with them; even as we 
<A NAME="76"></A>were brought up together in your own home, what time Menoetius brought 
<A NAME="77"></A>me to you as a child from Opoeis because by a sad spite I had killed the 
<A NAME="78"></A>son of Amphidamas- not of set purpose, but in childish quarrel over the 
<A NAME="79"></A>dice. The knight Peleus took me into his house, entreated me kindly, and 
<A NAME="80"></A>named me to be your squire; therefore let our bones lie in but a single 
<A NAME="81"></A>urn, the two-handled golden vase given to you by your 
<A NAME="82"></A>mother."
<A NAME="83"></A><BR><BR>And Achilles answered, "Why, true heart, are you come hither to 
<A NAME="84"></A>lay these charges upon me? will of my own self do all as you have bidden 
<A NAME="85"></A>me. Draw closer to me, let us once more throw our arms around one another, 
<A NAME="86"></A>and find sad comfort in the sharing of our sorrows."
<A NAME="87"></A><BR><BR>He opened his arms towards him as he spoke and would have clasped 
<A NAME="88"></A>him in them, but there was nothing, and the spirit vanished as a vapour, 
<A NAME="89"></A>gibbering and whining into the earth. Achilles sprang to his feet, smote 
<A NAME="90"></A>his two hands, and made lamentation saying, "Of a truth even in the house 
<A NAME="91"></A>of Hades there are ghosts and phantoms that have no life in them; all night 
<A NAME="92"></A>long the sad spirit of Patroclus has hovered over head making piteous moan, 
<A NAME="93"></A>telling me what I am to do for him, and looking wondrously like 
<A NAME="94"></A>himself."
<A NAME="95"></A><BR><BR>Thus did he speak and his words set them all weeping and mourning 
<A NAME="96"></A>about the poor dumb dead, till rosy-fingered morn appeared. Then King Agamemnon 
<A NAME="97"></A>sent men and mules from all parts of the camp, to bring wood, and Meriones, 
<A NAME="98"></A>squire to Idomeneus, was in charge over them. They went out with woodmen's 
<A NAME="99"></A>axes and strong ropes in their hands, and before them went the mules. Up 
<A NAME="100"></A>hill and down dale did they go, by straight ways and crooked, and when 
<A NAME="101"></A>they reached the heights of many-fountained Ida, they laid their axes to 
<A NAME="102"></A>the roots of many a tall branching oak that came thundering down as they 
<A NAME="103"></A>felled it. They split the trees and bound them behind the mules, which 
<A NAME="104"></A>then wended their way as they best could through the thick brushwood on 
<A NAME="105"></A>to the plain. All who had been cutting wood bore logs, for so Meriones 
<A NAME="106"></A>squire to Idomeneus had bidden them, and they threw them down in a line 
<A NAME="107"></A>upon the seashore at the place where Achilles would make a mighty monument 
<A NAME="108"></A>for Patroclus and for himself.
<A NAME="109"></A><BR><BR>When they had thrown down their great logs of wood over the whole 
<A NAME="110"></A>ground, they stayed all of them where they were, but Achilles ordered his 
<A NAME="111"></A>brave Myrmidons to gird on their armour, and to yoke each man his horses; 
<A NAME="112"></A>they therefore rose, girded on their armour and mounted each his chariot- 
<A NAME="113"></A>they and their charioteers with them. The chariots went before, and they 
<A NAME="114"></A>that were on foot followed as a cloud in their tens of thousands after. 
<A NAME="115"></A>In the midst of them his comrades bore Patroclus and covered him with the 
<A NAME="116"></A>locks of their hair which they cut off and threw upon his body. Last came 
<A NAME="117"></A>Achilles with his head bowed for sorrow, so noble a comrade was he taking 
<A NAME="118"></A>to the house of Hades.
<A NAME="119"></A><BR><BR>When they came to the place of which Achilles had told them they 
<A NAME="120"></A>laid the body down and built up the wood. Achilles then bethought him of 
<A NAME="121"></A>another matter. He went a space away from the pyre, and cut off the yellow 
<A NAME="122"></A>lock which he had let grow for the river Spercheius. He looked all sorrowfully 
<A NAME="123"></A>out upon the dark sea, and said, "Spercheius, in vain did my father Peleus 
<A NAME="124"></A>vow to you that when I returned home to my loved native land I should cut 
<A NAME="125"></A>off this lock and offer you a holy hecatomb; fifty she-goats was I to sacrifice 
<A NAME="126"></A>to you there at your springs, where is your grove and your altar fragrant 
<A NAME="127"></A>with burnt-offerings. Thus did my father vow, but you have not fulfilled 
<A NAME="128"></A>his prayer; now, therefore, that I shall see my home no more, I give this 
<A NAME="129"></A>lock as a keepsake to the hero Patroclus."
<A NAME="130"></A><BR><BR>As he spoke he placed the lock in the hands of his dear comrade, 
<A NAME="131"></A>and all who stood by were filled with yearning and lamentation. The sun 
<A NAME="132"></A>would have gone down upon their mourning had not Achilles presently said 
<A NAME="133"></A>to Agamemnon, "Son of Atreus, for it is to you that the people will give 
<A NAME="134"></A>ear, there is a time to mourn and a time to cease from mourning; bid the 
<A NAME="135"></A>people now leave the pyre and set about getting their dinners: we, to whom 
<A NAME="136"></A>the dead is dearest, will see to what is wanted here, and let the other 
<A NAME="137"></A>princes also stay by me."
<A NAME="138"></A><BR><BR>When King Agamemnon heard this he dismissed the people to their 
<A NAME="139"></A>ships, but those who were about the dead heaped up wood and built a pyre 
<A NAME="140"></A>a hundred feet this way and that; then they laid the dead all sorrowfully 
<A NAME="141"></A>upon the top of it. They flayed and dressed many fat sheep and oxen before 
<A NAME="142"></A>the pyre, and Achilles took fat from all of them and wrapped the body therein 
<A NAME="143"></A>from head to foot, heaping the flayed carcases all round it. Against the 
<A NAME="144"></A>bier he leaned two-handled jars of honey and unguents; four proud horses 
<A NAME="145"></A>did he then cast upon the pyre, groaning the while he did so. The dead 
<A NAME="146"></A>hero had had house-dogs; two of them did Achilles slay and threw upon the 
<A NAME="147"></A>pyre; he also put twelve brave sons of noble Trojans to the sword and laid 
<A NAME="148"></A>them with the rest, for he was full of bitterness and fury. Then he committed 
<A NAME="149"></A>all to the resistless and devouring might of the fire; he groaned aloud 
<A NAME="150"></A>and callid on his dead comrade by name. "Fare well," he cried, "Patroclus, 
<A NAME="151"></A>even in the house of Hades; I am now doing all that I have promised you. 
<A NAME="152"></A>Twelve brave sons of noble Trojans shall the flames consume along with 
<A NAME="153"></A>yourself, but dogs, not fire, shall devour the flesh of Hector son of 
<A NAME="154"></A>Priam."
<A NAME="155"></A><BR><BR>Thus did he vaunt, but the dogs came not about the body of Hector, 
<A NAME="156"></A>for Jove's daughter Venus kept them off him night and day, and anointed 
<A NAME="157"></A>him with ambrosial oil of roses that his flesh might not be torn when Achilles 
<A NAME="158"></A>was dragging him about. Phoebus Apollo moreover sent a dark cloud from 
<A NAME="159"></A>heaven to earth, which gave shade to the whole place where Hector lay, 
<A NAME="160"></A>that the heat of the sun might not parch his body.
<A NAME="161"></A><BR><BR>Now the pyre about dead Patroclus would not kindle. Achilles therefore 
<A NAME="162"></A>bethought him of another matter; he went apart and prayed to the two winds 
<A NAME="163"></A>Boreas and Zephyrus vowing them goodly offerings. He made them many drink-offerings 
<A NAME="164"></A>from the golden cup and besought them to come and help him that the wood 
<A NAME="165"></A>might make haste to kindle and the dead bodies be consumed. Fleet Iris 
<A NAME="166"></A>heard him praying and started off to fetch the winds. They were holding 
<A NAME="167"></A>high feast in the house of boisterous Zephyrus when Iris came running up 
<A NAME="168"></A>to the stone threshold of the house and stood there, but as soon as they 
<A NAME="169"></A>set eyes on her they all came towards her and each of them called her to 
<A NAME="170"></A>him, but Iris would not sit down. "I cannot stay," she said, "I must go 
<A NAME="171"></A>back to the streams of Oceanus and the land of the Ethiopians who are offering 
<A NAME="172"></A>hecatombs to the immortals, and I would have my share; but Achilles prays 
<A NAME="173"></A>that Boreas and shrill Zephyrus will come to him, and he vows them goodly 
<A NAME="174"></A>offerings; he would have you blow upon the pyre of Patroclus for whom all 
<A NAME="175"></A>the Achaeans are lamenting."
<A NAME="176"></A><BR><BR>With this she left them, and the two winds rose with a cry that 
<A NAME="177"></A>rent the air and swept the clouds before them. They blew on and on until 
<A NAME="178"></A>they came to the sea, and the waves rose high beneath them, but when they 
<A NAME="179"></A>reached Troy they fell upon the pyre till the mighty flames roared under 
<A NAME="180"></A>the blast that they blew. All night long did they blow hard and beat upon 
<A NAME="181"></A>the fire, and all night long did Achilles grasp his double cup, drawing 
<A NAME="182"></A>wine from a mixing-bowl of gold, and calling upon the spirit of dead Patroclus 
<A NAME="183"></A>as he poured it upon the ground until the earth was drenched. As a father 
<A NAME="184"></A>mourns when he is burning the bones of his bridegroom son whose death has 
<A NAME="185"></A>wrung the hearts of his parents, even so did Achilles mourn while burning 
<A NAME="186"></A>the body of his comrade, pacing round the bier with piteous groaning and 
<A NAME="187"></A>lamentation.
<A NAME="188"></A><BR><BR>At length as the Morning Star was beginning to herald the light 
<A NAME="189"></A>which saffron-mantled Dawn was soon to suffuse over the sea, the flames 
<A NAME="190"></A>fell and the fire began to die. The winds then went home beyond the Thracian 
<A NAME="191"></A>sea, which roared and boiled as they swept over it. The son of Peleus now 
<A NAME="192"></A>turned away from the pyre and lay down, overcome with toil, till he fell 
<A NAME="193"></A>into a sweet slumber. Presently they who were about the son of Atreus drew 
<A NAME="194"></A>near in a body, and roused him with the noise and tramp of their coming. 
<A NAME="195"></A>He sat upright and said, "Son of Atreus, and all other princes of the Achaeans, 
<A NAME="196"></A>first pour red wine everywhere upon the fire and quench it; let us then 
<A NAME="197"></A>gather the bones of Patroclus son of Menoetius, singling them out with 
<A NAME="198"></A>care; they are easily found, for they lie in the middle of the pyre, while 
<A NAME="199"></A>all else, both men and horses, has been thrown in a heap and burned at 
<A NAME="200"></A>the outer edge. We will lay the bones in a golden urn, in two layers of 
<A NAME="201"></A>fat, against the time when I shall myself go down into the house of Hades. 
<A NAME="202"></A>As for the barrow, labour not to raise a great one now, but such as is 
<A NAME="203"></A>reasonable. Afterwards, let those Achaeans who may be left at the ships 
<A NAME="204"></A>when I am gone, build it both broad and high."
<A NAME="205"></A><BR><BR>Thus he spoke and they obeyed the word of the son of Peleus. First 
<A NAME="206"></A>they poured red wine upon the thick layer of ashes and quenched the fire. 
<A NAME="207"></A>With many tears they singled out the whitened bones of their loved comrade 
<A NAME="208"></A>and laid them within a golden urn in two layers of fat: they then covered 
<A NAME="209"></A>the urn with a linen cloth and took it inside the tent. They marked off 
<A NAME="210"></A>the circle where the barrow should be, made a foundation for it about the 
<A NAME="211"></A>pyre, and forthwith heaped up the earth. When they had thus raised a mound 
<A NAME="212"></A>they were going away, but Achilles stayed the people and made them sit 
<A NAME="213"></A>in assembly. He brought prizes from the ships-cauldrons, tripods, horses 
<A NAME="214"></A>and mules, noble oxen, women with fair girdles, and swart 
<A NAME="215"></A>iron.
<A NAME="216"></A><BR><BR>The first prize he offered was for the chariot races- a woman skilled 
<A NAME="217"></A>in all useful arts, and a three-legged cauldron that had ears for handles, 
<A NAME="218"></A>and would hold twenty-two measures. This was for the man who came in first. 
<A NAME="219"></A>For the second there was a six-year old mare, unbroken, and in foal to 
<A NAME="220"></A>a he-ass; the third was to have a goodly cauldron that had never yet been 
<A NAME="221"></A>on the fire; it was still bright as when it left the maker, and would hold 
<A NAME="222"></A>four measures. The fourth prize was two talents of gold, and the fifth 
<A NAME="223"></A>a two-handled urn as yet unsoiled by smoke. Then he stood up and spoke 
<A NAME="224"></A>among the Argives saying-
<A NAME="225"></A><BR><BR>"Son of Atreus, and all other Achaeans, these are the prizes that 
<A NAME="226"></A>lie waiting the winners of the chariot races. At any other time I should 
<A NAME="227"></A>carry off the first prize and take it to my own tent; you know how far 
<A NAME="228"></A>my steeds excel all others- for they are immortal; Neptune gave them to 
<A NAME="229"></A>my father Peleus, who in his turn gave them to myself; but I shall hold 
<A NAME="230"></A>aloof, I and my steeds that have lost their brave and kind driver, who 
<A NAME="231"></A>many a time has washed them in clear water and anointed their manes with 
<A NAME="232"></A>oil. See how they stand weeping here, with their manes trailing on the 
<A NAME="233"></A>ground in the extremity of their sorrow. But do you others set yourselves 
<A NAME="234"></A>in order throughout the host, whosoever has confidence in his horses and 
<A NAME="235"></A>in the strength of his chariot."
<A NAME="236"></A><BR><BR>Thus spoke the son of Peleus and the drivers of chariots bestirred 
<A NAME="237"></A>themselves. First among them all uprose Eumelus, king of men, son of Admetus, 
<A NAME="238"></A>a man excellent in horsemanship. Next to him rose mighty Diomed son of 
<A NAME="239"></A>Tydeus; he yoked the Trojan horses which he had taken from Aeneas, when 
<A NAME="240"></A>Apollo bore him out of the fight. Next to him, yellow-haired Menelaus son 
<A NAME="241"></A>of Atreus rose and yoked his fleet horses, Agamemnon's mare Aethe, and 
<A NAME="242"></A>his own horse Podargus. The mare had been given to Agamemnon by echepolus 
<A NAME="243"></A>son of Anchises, that he might not have to follow him to Ilius, but might 
<A NAME="244"></A>stay at home and take his ease; for Jove had endowed him with great wealth 
<A NAME="245"></A>and he lived in spacious Sicyon. This mare, all eager for the race, did 
<A NAME="246"></A>Menelaus put under the yoke.
<A NAME="247"></A><BR><BR>Fourth in order Antilochus, son to noble Nestor son of Neleus, 
<A NAME="248"></A>made ready his horses. These were bred in Pylos, and his father came up 
<A NAME="249"></A>to him to give him good advice of which, however, he stood in but little 
<A NAME="250"></A>need. "Antilochus," said Nestor, "you are young, but Jove and Neptune have 
<A NAME="251"></A>loved you well, and have made you an excellent horseman. I need not therefore 
<A NAME="252"></A>say much by way of instruction. You are skilful at wheeling your horses 
<A NAME="253"></A>round the post, but the horses themselves are very slow, and it is this 
<A NAME="254"></A>that will, I fear, mar your chances. The other drivers know less than you 
<A NAME="255"></A>do, but their horses are fleeter; therefore, my dear son, see if you cannot 
<A NAME="256"></A>hit upon some artifice whereby you may insure that the prize shall not 
<A NAME="257"></A>slip through your fingers. The woodman does more by skill than by brute 
<A NAME="258"></A>force; by skill the pilot guides his storm-tossed barque over the sea, 
<A NAME="259"></A>and so by skill one driver can beat another. If a man go wide in rounding 
<A NAME="260"></A>this way and that, whereas a man who knows what he is doing may have worse 
<A NAME="261"></A>horses, but he will keep them well in hand when he sees the doubling-post; 
<A NAME="262"></A>he knows the precise moment at which to pull the rein, and keeps his eye 
<A NAME="263"></A>well on the man in front of him. I will give you this certain token which 
<A NAME="264"></A>cannot escape your notice. There is a stump of a dead tree-oak or pine 
<A NAME="265"></A>as it may be- some six feet above the ground, and not yet rotted away by 
<A NAME="266"></A>rain; it stands at the fork of the road; it has two white stones set one 
<A NAME="267"></A>on each side, and there is a clear course all round it. It may have been 
<A NAME="268"></A>a monument to some one long since dead, or it may have been used as a doubling-post 
<A NAME="269"></A>in days gone by; now, however, it has been fixed on by Achilles as the 
<A NAME="270"></A>mark round which the chariots shall turn; hug it as close as you can, but 
<A NAME="271"></A>as you stand in your chariot lean over a little to the left; urge on your 
<A NAME="272"></A>right-hand horse with voice and lash, and give him a loose rein, but let 
<A NAME="273"></A>the left-hand horse keep so close in, that the nave of your wheel shall 
<A NAME="274"></A>almost graze the post; but mind the stone, or you will wound your horses 
<A NAME="275"></A>and break your chariot in pieces, which would be sport for others but confusion 
<A NAME="276"></A>for yourself. Therefore, my dear son, mind well what you are about, for 
<A NAME="277"></A>if you can be first to round the post there is no chance of any one giving 
<A NAME="278"></A>you the goby later, not even though you had Adrestus's horse Arion behind 
<A NAME="279"></A>you horse which is of divine race- or those of Laomedon, which are the 
<A NAME="280"></A>noblest in this country."
<A NAME="281"></A><BR><BR>When Nestor had made an end of counselling his son he sat down 
<A NAME="282"></A>in his place, and fifth in order Meriones got ready his horses. They then 
<A NAME="283"></A>all mounted their chariots and cast lots.- Achilles shook the helmet, and 
<A NAME="284"></A>the lot of Antilochus son of Nestor fell out first; next came that of King 
<A NAME="285"></A>Eumelus, and after his, those of Menelaus son of Atreus and of Meriones. 
<A NAME="286"></A>The last place fell to the lot of Diomed son of Tydeus, who was the best 
<A NAME="287"></A>man of them all. They took their places in line; Achilles showed them the 
<A NAME="288"></A>doubling-post round which they were to turn, some way off upon the plain; 
<A NAME="289"></A>here he stationed his father's follower Phoenix as umpire, to note the 
<A NAME="290"></A>running, and report truly.
<A NAME="291"></A><BR><BR>At the same instant they all of them lashed their horses, struck 
<A NAME="292"></A>them with the reins, and shouted at them with all their might. They flew 
<A NAME="293"></A>full speed over the plain away from the ships, the dust rose from under 
<A NAME="294"></A>them as it were a cloud or whirlwind, and their manes were all flying in 
<A NAME="295"></A>the wind. At one moment the chariots seemed to touch the ground, and then 
<A NAME="296"></A>again they bounded into the air; the drivers stood erect, and their hearts 
<A NAME="297"></A>beat fast and furious in their lust of victory. Each kept calling on his 
<A NAME="298"></A>horses, and the horses scoured the plain amid the clouds of dust that they 
<A NAME="299"></A>raised.
<A NAME="300"></A><BR><BR>It was when they were doing the last part of the course on their 
<A NAME="301"></A>way back towards the sea that their pace was strained to the utmost and 
<A NAME="302"></A>it was seen what each could do. The horses of the descendant of Pheres 
<A NAME="303"></A>now took the lead, and close behind them came the Trojan stallions of Diomed. 
<A NAME="304"></A>They seemed as if about to mount Eumelus's chariot, and he could feel their 
<A NAME="305"></A>warm breath on his back and on his broad shoulders, for their heads were 
<A NAME="306"></A>close to him as they flew over the course. Diomed would have now passed 
<A NAME="307"></A>him, or there would have been a dead heat, but Phoebus Apollo to spite 
<A NAME="308"></A>him made him drop his whip. Tears of anger fell from his eyes as he saw 
<A NAME="309"></A>the mares going on faster than ever, while his own horses lost ground through 
<A NAME="310"></A>his having no whip. Minerva saw the trick which Apollo had played the son 
<A NAME="311"></A>of Tydeus, so she brought him his whip and put spirit into his horses; 
<A NAME="312"></A>moreover she went after the son of Admetus in a rage and broke his yoke 
<A NAME="313"></A>for him; the mares went one to one side the course, and the other to the 
<A NAME="314"></A>other, and the pole was broken against the ground. Eumelus was thrown from 
<A NAME="315"></A>his chariot close to the wheel; his elbows, mouth, and nostrils were all 
<A NAME="316"></A>torn, and his forehead was bruised above his eyebrows; his eyes filled 
<A NAME="317"></A>with tears and he could find no utterance. But the son of Tydeus turned 
<A NAME="318"></A>his horses aside and shot far ahead, for Minerva put fresh strength into 
<A NAME="319"></A>them and covered Diomed himself with glory.
<A NAME="320"></A><BR><BR>Menelaus son of Atreus came next behind him, but Antilochus called 
<A NAME="321"></A>to his father's horses. "On with you both," he cried, "and do your very 
<A NAME="322"></A>utmost. I do not bid you try to beat the steeds of the son of Tydeus, for 
<A NAME="323"></A>Minerva has put running into them, and has covered Diomed with glory; but 
<A NAME="324"></A>you must overtake the horses of the son of Atreus and not be left behind, 
<A NAME="325"></A>or Aethe who is so fleet will taunt you. Why, my good fellows, are you 
<A NAME="326"></A>lagging? I tell you, and it shall surely be- Nestor will keep neither of 
<A NAME="327"></A>you, but will put both of you to the sword, if we win any the worse a prize 
<A NAME="328"></A>through your carelessness, fly after them at your utmost speed; I will 
<A NAME="329"></A>hit on a plan for passing them in a narrow part of the way, and it shall 
<A NAME="330"></A>not fail me."
<A NAME="331"></A><BR><BR>They feared the rebuke of their master, and for a short space went 
<A NAME="332"></A>quicker. Presently Antilochus saw a narrow place where the road had sunk. 
<A NAME="333"></A>The ground was broken, for the winter's rain had gathered and had worn 
<A NAME="334"></A>the road so that the whole place was deepened. Menelaus was making towards 
<A NAME="335"></A>it so as to get there first, for fear of a foul, but Antilochus turned 
<A NAME="336"></A>his horses out of the way, and followed him a little on one side. The son 
<A NAME="337"></A>of Atreus was afraid and shouted out, "Antilochus, you are driving recklessly; 
<A NAME="338"></A>rein in your horses; the road is too narrow here, it will be wider soon, 
<A NAME="339"></A>and you can pass me then; if you foul my chariot you may bring both of 
<A NAME="340"></A>us to a mischief."
<A NAME="341"></A><BR><BR>But Antilochus plied his whip, and drove faster, as though he had 
<A NAME="342"></A>not heard him. They went side by side for about as far as a young man can 
<A NAME="343"></A>hurl a disc from his shoulder when he is trying his strength, and then 
<A NAME="344"></A>Menelaus's mares drew behind, for he left off driving for fear the horses 
<A NAME="345"></A>should foul one another and upset the chariots; thus, while pressing on 
<A NAME="346"></A>in quest of victory, they might both come headlong to the ground. Menelaus 
<A NAME="347"></A>then upbraided Antilochus and said, "There is no greater trickster living 
<A NAME="348"></A>than you are; go, and bad luck go with you; the Achaeans say not well that 
<A NAME="349"></A>you have understanding, and come what may you shall not bear away the prize 
<A NAME="350"></A>without sworn protest on my part."
<A NAME="351"></A><BR><BR>Then he called on his horses and said to them, "Keep your pace, 
<A NAME="352"></A>and slacken not; the limbs of the other horses will weary sooner than yours, 
<A NAME="353"></A>for they are neither of them young."
<A NAME="354"></A><BR><BR>The horses feared the rebuke of their master, and went faster, 
<A NAME="355"></A>so that they were soon nearly up with the others.
<A NAME="356"></A><BR><BR>Meanwhile the Achaeans from their seats were watching how the horses 
<A NAME="357"></A>went, as they scoured the plain amid clouds of their own dust. Idomeneus 
<A NAME="358"></A>captain of the Cretans was first to make out the running, for he was not 
<A NAME="359"></A>in the thick of the crowd, but stood on the most commanding part of the 
<A NAME="360"></A>ground. The driver was a long way off, but Idomeneus could hear him shouting, 
<A NAME="361"></A>and could see the foremost horse quite plainly- a chestnut with a round 
<A NAME="362"></A>white star, like the moon, on its forehead. He stood up and said among 
<A NAME="363"></A>the Argives, "My friends, princes and counsellors of the Argives, can you 
<A NAME="364"></A>see the running as well as I can? There seems to be another pair in front 
<A NAME="365"></A>now, and another driver; those that led off at the start must have been 
<A NAME="366"></A>disabled out on the plain. I saw them at first making their way round the 
<A NAME="367"></A>doubling-post, but now, though I search the plain of Troy, I cannot find 
<A NAME="368"></A>them. Perhaps the reins fell from the driver's hand so that he lost command 
<A NAME="369"></A>of his horses at the doubling-post, and could not turn it. I suppose he 
<A NAME="370"></A>must have been thrown out there, and broken his chariot, while his mares 
<A NAME="371"></A>have left the course and gone off wildly in a panic. Come up and see for 
<A NAME="372"></A>yourselves, I cannot make out for certain, but the driver seems an Aetolian 
<A NAME="373"></A>by descent, ruler over the Argives, brave Diomed the son of 
<A NAME="374"></A>Tydeus."
<A NAME="375"></A><BR><BR>Ajax the son of Oileus took him up rudely and said, "Idomeneus, 
<A NAME="376"></A>why should you be in such a hurry to tell us all about it, when the mares 
<A NAME="377"></A>are still so far out upon the plain? You are none of the youngest, nor 
<A NAME="378"></A>your eyes none of the sharpest, but you are always laying down the law. 
<A NAME="379"></A>You have no right to do so, for there are better men here than you are. 
<A NAME="380"></A>Eumelus's horses are in front now, as they always have been, and he is 
<A NAME="381"></A>on the chariot holding the reins."
<A NAME="382"></A><BR><BR>The captain of the Cretans was angry, and answered, "Ajax you are 
<A NAME="383"></A>an excellent railer, but you have no judgement, and are wanting in much 
<A NAME="384"></A>else as well, for you have a vile temper. I will wager you a tripod or 
<A NAME="385"></A>cauldron, and Agamemnon son of Atreus shall decide whose horses are first. 
<A NAME="386"></A>You will then know to your cost."
<A NAME="387"></A><BR><BR>Ajax son of Oileus was for making him an angry answer, and there 
<A NAME="388"></A>would have been yet further brawling between them, had not Achilles risen 
<A NAME="389"></A>in his place and said, "Cease your railing Ajax and Idomeneus; it is not 
<A NAME="390"></A>you would be scandalised if you saw any one else do the like: sit down 
<A NAME="391"></A>and keep your eyes on the horses; they are speeding towards the winning-post 
<A NAME="392"></A>and will be bere directly. You will then both of you know whose horses 
<A NAME="393"></A>are first, and whose come after."
<A NAME="394"></A><BR><BR>As he was speaking, the son of Tydeus came driving in, plying his 
<A NAME="395"></A>whip lustily from his shoulder, and his horses stepping high as they flew 
<A NAME="396"></A>over the course. The sand and grit rained thick on the driver, and the 
<A NAME="397"></A>chariot inlaid with gold and tin ran close behind his fleet horses. There 
<A NAME="398"></A>was little trace of wheel-marks in the fine dust, and the horses came flying 
<A NAME="399"></A>in at their utmost speed. Diomed stayed them in the middle of the crowd, 
<A NAME="400"></A>and the sweat from their manes and chests fell in streams on to the ground. 
<A NAME="401"></A>Forthwith he sprang from his goodly chariot, and leaned his whip against 
<A NAME="402"></A>his horses' yoke; brave Sthenelus now lost no time, but at once brought 
<A NAME="403"></A>on the prize, and gave the woman and the ear-handled cauldron to his comrades 
<A NAME="404"></A>to take away. Then he unyoked the horses.
<A NAME="405"></A><BR><BR>Next after him came in Antilochus of the race of Neleus, who had 
<A NAME="406"></A>passed Menelaus by a trick and not by the fleetness of his horses; but 
<A NAME="407"></A>even so Menelaus came in as close behind him as the wheel is to the horse 
<A NAME="408"></A>that draws both the chariot and its master. The end hairs of a horse's 
<A NAME="409"></A>tail touch the tyre of the wheel, and there is never much space between 
<A NAME="410"></A>wheel and horse when the chariot is going; Menelaus was no further than 
<A NAME="411"></A>this behind Antilochus, though at first he had been a full disc's throw 
<A NAME="412"></A>behind him. He had soon caught him up again, for Agamemnon's mare Aethe 
<A NAME="413"></A>kept pulling stronger and stronger, so that if the course had been longer 
<A NAME="414"></A>he would have passed him, and there would not even have been a dead heat. 
<A NAME="415"></A>Idomeneus's brave squire Meriones was about a spear's cast behind Menelaus. 
<A NAME="416"></A>His horses were slowest of all, and he was the worst driver. Last of them 
<A NAME="417"></A>all came the son of Admetus, dragging his chariot and driving his horses 
<A NAME="418"></A>on in front. When Achilles saw him he was sorry, and stood up among the 
<A NAME="419"></A>Argives saying, "The best man is coming in last. Let us give him a prize 
<A NAME="420"></A>for it is reasonable. He shall have the second, but the first must go to 
<A NAME="421"></A>the son of Tydeus."
<A NAME="422"></A><BR><BR>Thus did he speak and the others all of them applauded his saying, 
<A NAME="423"></A>and were for doing as he had said, but Nestor's son Antilochus stood up 
<A NAME="424"></A>and claimed his rights from the son of Peleus. "Achilles," said he, "I 
<A NAME="425"></A>shall take it much amiss if you do this thing; you would rob me of my prize, 
<A NAME="426"></A>because you think Eumelus's chariot and horses were thrown out, and himself 
<A NAME="427"></A>too, good man that he is. He should have prayed duly to the immortals; 
<A NAME="428"></A>he would not have come in fast if he had done so. If you are sorry for 
<A NAME="429"></A>him and so choose, you have much gold in your tents, with bronze, sheep, 
<A NAME="430"></A>cattle and horses. Take something from this store if you would have the 
<A NAME="431"></A>Achaeans speak well of you, and give him a better prize even than that 
<A NAME="432"></A>which you have now offered; but I will not give up the mare, and he that 
<A NAME="433"></A>will fight me for her, let him come on."
<A NAME="434"></A><BR><BR>Achilles smiled as he heard this, and was pleased with Antilochus, 
<A NAME="435"></A>who was one of his dearest comrades. So he said-
<A NAME="436"></A><BR><BR>"Antilochus, if you would have me find Eumelus another prize, I 
<A NAME="437"></A>will give him the bronze breastplate with a rim of tin running all round 
<A NAME="438"></A>it which I took from Asteropaeus. It will be worth much money to 
<A NAME="439"></A>him."
<A NAME="440"></A><BR><BR>He bade his comrade Automedon bring the breastplate from his tent, 
<A NAME="441"></A>and he did so. Achilles then gave it over to Eumelus, who received it 
<A NAME="442"></A>gladly.
<A NAME="443"></A><BR><BR>But Menelaus got up in a rage, furiously angry with Antilochus. 
<A NAME="444"></A>An attendant placed his staff in his hands and bade the Argives keep silence: 
<A NAME="445"></A>the hero then addressed them. "Antilochus," said he, "what is this from 
<A NAME="446"></A>you who have been so far blameless? You have made me cut a poor figure 
<A NAME="447"></A>and baulked my horses by flinging your own in front of them, though yours 
<A NAME="448"></A>are much worse than mine are; therefore, O princes and counsellors of the 
<A NAME="449"></A>Argives, judge between us and show no favour, lest one of the Achaeans 
<A NAME="450"></A>say, 'Menelaus has got the mare through lying and corruption; his horses 
<A NAME="451"></A>were far inferior to Antilochus's, but he has greater weight and influence.' 
<A NAME="452"></A>Nay, I will determine the matter myself, and no man will blame me, for 
<A NAME="453"></A>I shall do what is just. Come here, Antilochus, and stand, as our custom 
<A NAME="454"></A>is, whip in hand before your chariot and horses; lay your hand on your 
<A NAME="455"></A>steeds, and swear by earth-encircling Neptune that you did not purposely 
<A NAME="456"></A>and guilefully get in the way of my horses."
<A NAME="457"></A><BR><BR>And Antilochus answered, "Forgive me; I am much younger, King Menelaus, 
<A NAME="458"></A>than you are; you stand higher than I do and are the better man of the 
<A NAME="459"></A>two; you know how easily young men are betrayed into indiscretion; their 
<A NAME="460"></A>tempers are more hasty and they have less judgement; make due allowances 
<A NAME="461"></A>therefore, and bear with me; I will of my own accord give up the mare that 
<A NAME="462"></A>I have won, and if you claim any further chattel from my own possessions, 
<A NAME="463"></A>I would rather yield it to you, at once, than fall from your good graces 
<A NAME="464"></A>henceforth, and do wrong in the sight of heaven."
<A NAME="465"></A><BR><BR>The son of Nestor then took the mare and gave her over to Menelaus, 
<A NAME="466"></A>whose anger was thus appeased; as when dew falls upon a field of ripening 
<A NAME="467"></A>corn, and the lands are bristling with the harvest- even so, O Menelaus, 
<A NAME="468"></A>was your heart made glad within you. He turned to Antilochus and said, 
<A NAME="469"></A>"Now, Antilochus, angry though I have been, I can give way to you of my 
<A NAME="470"></A>own free will; you have never been headstrong nor ill-disposed hitherto, 
<A NAME="471"></A>but this time your youth has got the better of your judgement; be careful 
<A NAME="472"></A>how you outwit your betters in future; no one else could have brought me 
<A NAME="473"></A>round so easily, but your good father, your brother, and yourself have 
<A NAME="474"></A>all of you had infinite trouble on my behalf; I therefore yield to your 
<A NAME="475"></A>entreaty, and will give up the mare to you, mine though it indeed be; the 
<A NAME="476"></A>people will thus see that I am neither harsh nor vindictive."
<A NAME="477"></A><BR><BR>With this he gave the mare over to Antilochus's comrade Noemon, 
<A NAME="478"></A>and then took the cauldron. Meriones, who had come in fourth, carried off 
<A NAME="479"></A>the two talents of gold, and the fifth prize, the two-handled urn, being 
<A NAME="480"></A>unawarded, Achilles gave it to Nestor, going up to him among the assembled 
<A NAME="481"></A>Argives and saying, "Take this, my good old friend, as an heirloom and 
<A NAME="482"></A>memorial of the funeral of Patroclus- for you shall see him no more among 
<A NAME="483"></A>the Argives. I give you this prize though you cannot win one; you can now 
<A NAME="484"></A>neither wrestle nor fight, and cannot enter for the javelin-match nor foot-races, 
<A NAME="485"></A>for the hand of age has been laid heavily upon you."
<A NAME="486"></A><BR><BR>So saying he gave the urn over to Nestor, who received it gladly 
<A NAME="487"></A>and answered, "My son, all that you have said is true; there is no strength 
<A NAME="488"></A>now in my legs and feet, nor can I hit out with my hands from either shoulder. 
<A NAME="489"></A>Would that I were still young and strong as when the Epeans were burying 
<A NAME="490"></A>King Amarynceus in Buprasium, and his sons offered prizes in his honour. 
<A NAME="491"></A>There was then none that could vie with me neither of the Epeans nor the 
<A NAME="492"></A>Pylians themselves nor the Aetolians. In boxing I overcame Clytomedes son 
<A NAME="493"></A>of Enops, and in wrestling, Ancaeus of Pleuron who had come forward against 
<A NAME="494"></A>me. Iphiclus was a good runner, but I beat him, and threw farther with 
<A NAME="495"></A>my spear than either Phyleus or Polydorus. In chariot-racing alone did 
<A NAME="496"></A>the two sons of Actor surpass me by crowding their horses in front of me, 
<A NAME="497"></A>for they were angry at the way victory had gone, and at the greater part 
<A NAME="498"></A>of the prizes remaining in the place in which they had been offered. They 
<A NAME="499"></A>were twins, and the one kept on holding the reins, and holding the reins, 
<A NAME="500"></A>while the other plied the whip. Such was I then, but now I must leave these 
<A NAME="501"></A>matters to younger men; I must bow before the weight of years, but in those 
<A NAME="502"></A>days I was eminent among heroes. And now, sir, go on with the funeral contests 
<A NAME="503"></A>in honour of your comrade: gladly do I accept this urn, and my heart rejoices 
<A NAME="504"></A>that you do not forget me but are ever mindful of my goodwill towards you, 
<A NAME="505"></A>and of the respect due to me from the Achaeans. For all which may the grace 
<A NAME="506"></A>of heaven be vouchsafed you in great abundance."
<A NAME="507"></A><BR><BR>Thereon the son of Peleus, when he had listened to all the thanks 
<A NAME="508"></A>of Nestor, went about among the concourse of the Achaeans, and presently 
<A NAME="509"></A>offered prizes for skill in the painful art of boxing. He brought out a 
<A NAME="510"></A>strong mule, and made it fast in the middle of the crowd- a she-mule never 
<A NAME="511"></A>yet broken, but six years old-  when it is hardest of all to break them: 
<A NAME="512"></A>this was for the victor, and for the vanquished he offered a double cup. 
<A NAME="513"></A>Then he stood up and said among the Argives, "Son of Atreus, and all other 
<A NAME="514"></A>Achaeans, I invite our two champion boxers to lay about them lustily and 
<A NAME="515"></A>compete for these prizes. He to whom Apollo vouchsafes the greater endurance, 
<A NAME="516"></A>and whom the Achaeans acknowledge as victor, shall take the mule back with 
<A NAME="517"></A>him to his own tent, while he that is vanquished shall have the double 
<A NAME="518"></A>cup."
<A NAME="519"></A><BR><BR>As he spoke there stood up a champion both brave and great stature, 
<A NAME="520"></A>a skilful boxer, Epeus, son of Panopeus. He laid his hand on the mule and 
<A NAME="521"></A>said, "Let the man who is to have the cup come hither, for none but myself 
<A NAME="522"></A>will take the mule. I am the best boxer of all here present, and none can 
<A NAME="523"></A>beat me. Is it not enough that I should fall short of you in actual fighting? 
<A NAME="524"></A>Still, no man can be good at everything. I tell you plainly, and it shall 
<A NAME="525"></A>come true; if any man will box with me I will bruise his body and break 
<A NAME="526"></A>his bones; therefore let his friends stay here in a body and be at hand 
<A NAME="527"></A>to take him away when I have done with him."
<A NAME="528"></A><BR><BR>They all held their peace, and no man rose save Euryalus son of 
<A NAME="529"></A>Mecisteus, who was son of Talaus. Mecisteus went once to Thebes after the 
<A NAME="530"></A>fall of Oedipus, to attend his funeral, and he beat all the people of Cadmus. 
<A NAME="531"></A>The son of Tydeus was Euryalus's second, cheering him on and hoping heartily 
<A NAME="532"></A>that he would win. First he put a waistband round him and then he gave 
<A NAME="533"></A>him some well-cut thongs of ox-hide; the two men being now girt went into 
<A NAME="534"></A>the middle of the ring, and immediately fell to; heavily indeed did they 
<A NAME="535"></A>punish one another and lay about them with their brawny fists. One could 
<A NAME="536"></A>hear the horrid crashing of their jaws, and they sweated from every pore 
<A NAME="537"></A>of their skin. Presently Epeus came on and gave Euryalus a blow on the 
<A NAME="538"></A>jaw as he was looking round; Euryalus could not keep his legs; they gave 
<A NAME="539"></A>way under him in a moment and he sprang up with a bound, as a fish leaps 
<A NAME="540"></A>into the air near some shore that is all bestrewn with sea-wrack, when 
<A NAME="541"></A>Boreas furs the top of the waves, and then falls back into deep water. 
<A NAME="542"></A>But noble Epeus caught hold of him and raised him up; his comrades also 
<A NAME="543"></A>came round him and led him from the ring, unsteady in his gait, his head 
<A NAME="544"></A>hanging on one side, and spitting great clots of gore. They set him down 
<A NAME="545"></A>in a swoon and then went to fetch the double cup.
<A NAME="546"></A><BR><BR>The son of Peleus now brought out the prizes for the third contest 
<A NAME="547"></A>and showed them to the Argives. These were for the painful art of wrestling. 
<A NAME="548"></A>For the winner there was a great tripod ready for setting upon the fire, 
<A NAME="549"></A>and the Achaeans valued it among themselves at twelve oxen. For the loser 
<A NAME="550"></A>he brought out a woman skilled in all manner of arts, and they valued her 
<A NAME="551"></A>at four oxen. He rose and said among the Argives, "Stand forward, you who 
<A NAME="552"></A>will essay this contest."
<A NAME="553"></A><BR><BR>Forthwith uprose great Ajax the son of Telamon, and crafty Ulysses, 
<A NAME="554"></A>full of wiles rose also. The two girded themselves and went into the middle 
<A NAME="555"></A>of the ring. They gripped each other in their strong hands like the rafters 
<A NAME="556"></A>which some master-builder frames for the roof of a high house to keep the 
<A NAME="557"></A>wind out. Their backbones cracked as they tugged at one another with their 
<A NAME="558"></A>mighty arms- and sweat rained from them in torrents. Many a bloody weal 
<A NAME="559"></A>sprang up on their sides and shoulders, but they kept on striving with 
<A NAME="560"></A>might and main for victory and to win the tripod. Ulysses could not throw 
<A NAME="561"></A>Ajax, nor Ajax him; Ulysses was too strong for him; but when the Achaeans 
<A NAME="562"></A>began to tire of watching them, Ajax said to ulysses, "Ulysses, noble son 
<A NAME="563"></A>of Laertes, you shall either lift me, or I you, and let Jove settle it 
<A NAME="564"></A>between us."
<A NAME="565"></A><BR><BR>He lifted him from the ground as he spoke, but Ulysses did not 
<A NAME="566"></A>forget his cunning. He hit Ajax in the hollow at back of his knee, so that 
<A NAME="567"></A>he could not keep his feet, but fell on his back with Ulysses lying upon 
<A NAME="568"></A>his chest, and all who saw it marvelled. Then Ulysses in turn lifted Ajax 
<A NAME="569"></A>and stirred him a little from the ground but could not lift him right off 
<A NAME="570"></A>it, his knee sank under him, and the two fell side by side on the ground 
<A NAME="571"></A>and were all begrimed with dust. They now sprang towards one another and 
<A NAME="572"></A>were for wrestling yet a third time, but Achilles rose and stayed them. 
<A NAME="573"></A>"Put not each other further," said he, "to such cruel suffering; the victory 
<A NAME="574"></A>is with both alike, take each of you an equal prize, and let the other 
<A NAME="575"></A>Achaeans now compete."
<A NAME="576"></A><BR><BR>Thus did he speak and they did even as he had said, and put on 
<A NAME="577"></A>their shirts again after wiping the dust from off their 
<A NAME="578"></A>bodies.
<A NAME="579"></A><BR><BR>The son of Peleus then offered prizes for speed in running- a mixing-bowl 
<A NAME="580"></A>beautifully wrought, of pure silver. It would hold six measures, and far 
<A NAME="581"></A>exceeded all others in the whole world for beauty; it was the work of cunning 
<A NAME="582"></A>artificers in Sidon, and had been brought into port by Phoenicians from 
<A NAME="583"></A>beyond the sea, who had made a present of it to Thoas. Eueneus son of jason 
<A NAME="584"></A>had given it to Patroclus in ransom of Priam's son Lycaon, and Achilles 
<A NAME="585"></A>now offered it as a prize in honour of his comrade to him who should be 
<A NAME="586"></A>the swiftest runner. For the second prize he offered a large ox, well fattened, 
<A NAME="587"></A>while for the last there was to be half a talent of gold. He then rose 
<A NAME="588"></A>and said among the Argives, "Stand forward, you who will essay this 
<A NAME="589"></A>contest."
<A NAME="590"></A><BR><BR>Forthwith uprose fleet Ajax son of Oileus, with cunning Ulysses, 
<A NAME="591"></A>and Nestor's son Antilochus, the fastest runner among all the youth of 
<A NAME="592"></A>his time. They stood side by side and Achilles showed them the goal. The 
<A NAME="593"></A>course was set out for them from the starting-post, and the son of Oileus 
<A NAME="594"></A>took the lead at once, with Ulysses as close behind him as the shuttle 
<A NAME="595"></A>is to a woman's bosom when she throws the woof across the warp and holds 
<A NAME="596"></A>it close up to her; even so close behind him was Ulysses- treading in his 
<A NAME="597"></A>footprints before the dust could settle there, and Ajax could feel his 
<A NAME="598"></A>breath on the back of his head as he ran swiftly on. The Achaeans all shouted 
<A NAME="599"></A>applause as they saw him straining his utmost, and cheered him as he shot 
<A NAME="600"></A>past them; but when they were now nearing the end of the course Ulysses 
<A NAME="601"></A>prayed inwardly to Minerva. "Hear me," he cried, "and help my feet, O goddess." 
<A NAME="602"></A>Thus did he pray, and Pallas Minerva heard his prayer; she made his hands 
<A NAME="603"></A>and his feet feel light, and when the runners were at the point of pouncing 
<A NAME="604"></A>upon the prize, Ajax, through Minerva's spite slipped upon some offal that 
<A NAME="605"></A>was lying there from the cattle which Achilles had slaughtered in honour 
<A NAME="606"></A>of Patroclus, and his mouth and nostrils were all filled with cow dung. 
<A NAME="607"></A>Ulysses therefore carried off the mixing-bowl, for he got before Ajax and 
<A NAME="608"></A>came in first. But Ajax took the ox and stood with his hand on one of its 
<A NAME="609"></A>horns, spitting the dung out of his mouth. Then he said to the Argives, 
<A NAME="610"></A>"Alas, the goddess has spoiled my running; she watches over Ulysses and 
<A NAME="611"></A>stands by him as though she were his own mother." Thus did he speak and 
<A NAME="612"></A>they all of them laughed heartily.
<A NAME="613"></A><BR><BR>Antilochus carried off the last prize and smiled as he said to 
<A NAME="614"></A>the bystanders, "You all see, my friends, that now too the gods have shown 
<A NAME="615"></A>their respect for seniority. Ajax is somewhat older than I am, and as for 
<A NAME="616"></A>Ulysses, he belongs to an earlier generation, but he is hale in spite of 
<A NAME="617"></A>his years, and no man of the Achaeans can run against him save only 
<A NAME="618"></A>Achilles."
<A NAME="619"></A><BR><BR>He said this to pay a compliment to the son of Peleus, and Achilles 
<A NAME="620"></A>answered, "Antilochus, you shall not have praised me to no purpose; I shall 
<A NAME="621"></A>give you an additional half talent of gold." He then gave the half talent 
<A NAME="622"></A>to Antilochus, who received it gladly.
<A NAME="623"></A><BR><BR>Then the son of Peleus brought out the spear, helmet and shield 
<A NAME="624"></A>that had been borne by Sarpedon, and were taken from him by Patroclus. 
<A NAME="625"></A>He stood up and said among the Argives, "We bid two champions put on their 
<A NAME="626"></A>armour, take their keen blades, and make trial of one another in the presence 
<A NAME="627"></A>of the multitude; whichever of them can first wound the flesh of the other, 
<A NAME="628"></A>cut through his armour, and draw blood, to him will I give this goodly 
<A NAME="629"></A>Thracian sword inlaid with silver, which I took from Asteropaeus, but the 
<A NAME="630"></A>armour let both hold in partnership, and I will give each of them a hearty 
<A NAME="631"></A>meal in my own tent."
<A NAME="632"></A><BR><BR>Forthwith uprose great Ajax the son of Telamon, as also mighty 
<A NAME="633"></A>Diomed son of Tydeus. When they had put on their armour each on his own 
<A NAME="634"></A>side of the ring, they both went into the middle eager to engage, and with 
<A NAME="635"></A>fire flashing from their eyes. The Achaeans marvelled as they beheld them, 
<A NAME="636"></A>and when the two were now close up with one another, thrice did they spring 
<A NAME="637"></A>forward and thrice try to strike each other in close combat. Ajax pierced 
<A NAME="638"></A>Diomed's round shield, but did not draw blood, for the cuirass beneath 
<A NAME="639"></A>the shield protected him; thereon the son of Tydeus from over his huge 
<A NAME="640"></A>shield kept aiming continually at Ajax's neck with the point of his spear, 
<A NAME="641"></A>and the Achaeans alarmed for his safety bade them leave off fighting and 
<A NAME="642"></A>divide the prize between them. Achilles then gave the great sword to the 
<A NAME="643"></A>son of Tydeus, with its scabbard, and the leathern belt with which to hang 
<A NAME="644"></A>it.
<A NAME="645"></A><BR><BR>Achilles next offered the massive iron quoit which mighty Eetion 
<A NAME="646"></A>had erewhile been used to hurl, until Achilles had slain him and carried 
<A NAME="647"></A>it off in his ships along with other spoils. He stood up and said among 
<A NAME="648"></A>the Argives, "Stand forward, you who would essay this contest. He who wins 
<A NAME="649"></A>it will have a store of iron that will last him five years as they go rolling 
<A NAME="650"></A>round, and if his fair fields lie far from a town his shepherd or ploughman 
<A NAME="651"></A>will not have to make a journey to buy iron, for he will have a stock of 
<A NAME="652"></A>it on his own premises."
<A NAME="653"></A><BR><BR>Then uprose the two mighty men Polypoetes and Leonteus, with Ajax 
<A NAME="654"></A>son of Telamon and noble Epeus. They stood up one after the other and Epeus 
<A NAME="655"></A>took the quoit, whirled it, and flung it from him, which set all the Achaeans 
<A NAME="656"></A>laughing. After him threw Leonteus of the race of Mars. Ajax son of Telamon 
<A NAME="657"></A>threw third, and sent the quoit beyond any mark that had been made yet, 
<A NAME="658"></A>but when mighty Polypoetes took the quoit he hurled it as though it had 
<A NAME="659"></A>been a stockman's stick which he sends flying about among his cattle when 
<A NAME="660"></A>he is driving them, so far did his throw out-distance those of the others. 
<A NAME="661"></A>All who saw it roared applause, and his comrades carried the prize for 
<A NAME="662"></A>him and set it on board his ship.
<A NAME="663"></A><BR><BR>Achilles next offered a prize of iron for archery- ten double-edged 
<A NAME="664"></A>axes and ten with single eddies: he set up a ship's mast, some way off 
<A NAME="665"></A>upon the sands, and with a fine string tied a pigeon to it by the foot; 
<A NAME="666"></A>this was what they were to aim at. "Whoever," he said, "can hit the pigeon 
<A NAME="667"></A>shall have all the axes and take them away with him; he who hits the string 
<A NAME="668"></A>without hitting the bird will have taken a worse aim and shall have the 
<A NAME="669"></A>single-edged axes."
<A NAME="670"></A><BR><BR>Then uprose King Teucer, and Meriones the stalwart squire of Idomeneus 
<A NAME="671"></A>rose also, They cast lots in a bronze helmet and the lot of Teucer fell 
<A NAME="672"></A>first. He let fly with his arrow forthwith, but he did not promise hecatombs 
<A NAME="673"></A>of firstling lambs to King Apollo, and missed his bird, for Apollo foiled 
<A NAME="674"></A>his aim; but he hit the string with which the bird was tied, near its foot; 
<A NAME="675"></A>the arrow cut the string clean through so that it hung down towards the 
<A NAME="676"></A>ground, while the bird flew up into the sky, and the Achaeans shouted applause. 
<A NAME="677"></A>Meriones, who had his arrow ready while Teucer was aiming, snatched the 
<A NAME="678"></A>bow out of his hand, and at once promised that he would sacrifice a hecatomb 
<A NAME="679"></A>of firstling lambs to Apollo lord of the bow; then espying the pigeon high 
<A NAME="680"></A>up under the clouds, he hit her in the middle of the wing as she was circling 
<A NAME="681"></A>upwards; the arrow went clean through the wing and fixed itself in the 
<A NAME="682"></A>ground at Meriones' feet, but the bird perched on the ship's mast hanging 
<A NAME="683"></A>her head and with all her feathers drooping; the life went out of her, 
<A NAME="684"></A>and she fell heavily from the mast. Meriones, therefore, took all ten double-edged 
<A NAME="685"></A>axes, while Teucer bore off the single-edged ones to his 
<A NAME="686"></A>ships.
<A NAME="687"></A><BR><BR>Then the son of Peleus brought in a spear and a cauldron that had 
<A NAME="688"></A>never been on the fire; it was worth an ox, and was chased with a pattern 
<A NAME="689"></A>of flowers; and those that throw the javelin stood up- to wit the son of 
<A NAME="690"></A>Atreus, king of men Agamemnon, and Meriones, stalwart squire of Idomeneus. 
<A NAME="691"></A>But Achilles spoke saying, "Son of Atreus, we know how far you excel all 
<A NAME="692"></A>others both in power and in throwing the javelin; take the cauldron back 
<A NAME="693"></A>with you to your ships, but if it so please you, let us give the spear 
<A NAME="694"></A>to Meriones; this at least is what I should myself wish."
<A NAME="695"></A><BR><BR>King Agamemnon assented. So he gave the bronze spear to Meriones, 
<A NAME="696"></A>and handed the goodly cauldron to Talthybius his esquire.
