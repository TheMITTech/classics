<A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A>The fight between Trojans and Achaeans was now left to rage as it would, 
<A NAME="11"></A>and the tide of war surged hither and thither over the plain as they aimed 
<A NAME="12"></A>their bronze-shod spears at one another between the streams of Simois and 
<A NAME="13"></A>Xanthus.
<A NAME="14"></A><BR><BR>First, Ajax son of Telamon, tower of strength to the Achaeans, 
<A NAME="15"></A>broke a phalanx of the Trojans, and came to the assistance of his comrades 
<A NAME="16"></A>by killing Acamas son of Eussorus, the best man among the Thracians, being 
<A NAME="17"></A>both brave and of great stature. The spear struck the projecting peak of 
<A NAME="18"></A>his helmet: its bronze point then went through his forehead into the brain, 
<A NAME="19"></A>and darkness veiled his eyes.
<A NAME="20"></A><BR><BR>Then Diomed killed Axylus son of Teuthranus, a rich man who lived 
<A NAME="21"></A>in the strong city of Arisbe, and was beloved by all men; for he had a 
<A NAME="22"></A>house by the roadside, and entertained every one who passed; howbeit not 
<A NAME="23"></A>one of his guests stood before him to save his life, and Diomed killed 
<A NAME="24"></A>both him and his squire Calesius, who was then his charioteer- so the pair 
<A NAME="25"></A>passed beneath the earth.
<A NAME="26"></A><BR><BR>Euryalus killed Dresus and Opheltius, and then went in pursuit 
<A NAME="27"></A>of Aesepus and Pedasus, whom the naiad nymph Abarbarea had borne to noble 
<A NAME="28"></A>Bucolion. Bucolion was eldest son to Laomedon, but he was a bastard. While 
<A NAME="29"></A>tending his sheep he had converse with the nymph, and she conceived twin 
<A NAME="30"></A>sons; these the son of Mecisteus now slew, and he stripped the armour from 
<A NAME="31"></A>their shoulders. Polypoetes then killed Astyalus, Ulysses Pidytes of Percote, 
<A NAME="32"></A>and Teucer Aretaon. Ablerus fell by the spear of Nestor's son Antilochus, 
<A NAME="33"></A>and Agamemnon, king of men, killed Elatus who dwelt in Pedasus by the banks 
<A NAME="34"></A>of the river Satnioeis. Leitus killed Phylacus as he was flying, and Eurypylus 
<A NAME="35"></A>slew Melanthus.
<A NAME="36"></A><BR><BR>Then Menelaus of the loud war-cry took Adrestus alive, for his 
<A NAME="37"></A>horses ran into a tamarisk bush, as they were flying wildly over the plain, 
<A NAME="38"></A>and broke the pole from the car; they went on towards the city along with 
<A NAME="39"></A>the others in full flight, but Adrestus rolled out, and fell in the dust 
<A NAME="40"></A>flat on his face by the wheel of his chariot; Menelaus came up to him spear 
<A NAME="41"></A>in hand, but Adrestus caught him by the knees begging for his life. "Take 
<A NAME="42"></A>me alive," he cried, "son of Atreus, and you shall have a full ransom for 
<A NAME="43"></A>me: my father is rich and has much treasure of gold, bronze, and wrought 
<A NAME="44"></A>iron laid by in his house. From this store he will give you a large ransom 
<A NAME="45"></A>should he hear of my being alive and at the ships of the 
<A NAME="46"></A>Achaeans."
<A NAME="47"></A><BR><BR>Thus did he plead, and Menelaus was for yielding and giving him 
<A NAME="48"></A>to a squire to take to the ships of the Achaeans, but Agamemnon came running 
<A NAME="49"></A>up to him and rebuked him. "My good Menelaus," said he, "this is no time 
<A NAME="50"></A>for giving quarter. Has, then, your house fared so well at the hands of 
<A NAME="51"></A>the Trojans? Let us not spare a single one of them- not even the child 
<A NAME="52"></A>unborn and in its mother's womb; let not a man of them be left alive, but 
<A NAME="53"></A>let all in Ilius perish, unheeded and forgotten."
<A NAME="54"></A><BR><BR>Thus did he speak, and his brother was persuaded by him, for his 
<A NAME="55"></A>words were just. Menelaus, therefore, thrust Adrestus from him, whereon 
<A NAME="56"></A>King Agamemnon struck him in the flank, and he fell: then the son of Atreus 
<A NAME="57"></A>planted his foot upon his breast to draw his spear from the 
<A NAME="58"></A>body.
<A NAME="59"></A><BR><BR>Meanwhile Nestor shouted to the Argives, saying, "My friends, Danaan 
<A NAME="60"></A>warriors, servants of Mars, let no man lag that he may spoil the dead, 
<A NAME="61"></A>and bring back much booty to the ships. Let us kill as many as we can; 
<A NAME="62"></A>the bodies will lie upon the plain, and you can despoil them later at your 
<A NAME="63"></A>leisure."
<A NAME="64"></A><BR><BR>With these words he put heart and soul into them all. And now the 
<A NAME="65"></A>Trojans would have been routed and driven back into Ilius, had not Priam's 
<A NAME="66"></A>son Helenus, wisest of augurs, said to Hector and Aeneas, "Hector and Aeneas, 
<A NAME="67"></A>you two are the mainstays of the Trojans and Lycians, for you are foremost 
<A NAME="68"></A>at all times, alike in fight and counsel; hold your ground here, and go 
<A NAME="69"></A>about among the host to rally them in front of the gates, or they will 
<A NAME="70"></A>fling themselves into the arms of their wives, to the great joy of our 
<A NAME="71"></A>foes. Then, when you have put heart into all our companies, we will stand 
<A NAME="72"></A>firm here and fight the Danaans however hard they press us, for there is 
<A NAME="73"></A>nothing else to be done. Meanwhile do you, Hector, go to the city and tell 
<A NAME="74"></A>our mother what is happening. Tell her to bid the matrons gather at the 
<A NAME="75"></A>temple of Minerva in the acropolis; let her then take her key and open 
<A NAME="76"></A>the doors of the sacred building; there, upon the knees of Minerva, let 
<A NAME="77"></A>her lay the largest, fairest robe she has in her house- the one she sets 
<A NAME="78"></A>most store by; let her, moreover, promise to sacrifice twelve yearling 
<A NAME="79"></A>heifers that have never yet felt the goad, in the temple of the goddess, 
<A NAME="80"></A>if she will take pity on the town, with the wives and little ones of the 
<A NAME="81"></A>Trojans, and keep the son of Tydeus from falling on the goodly city of 
<A NAME="82"></A>Ilius; for he fights with fury and fills men's souls with panic. I hold 
<A NAME="83"></A>him mightiest of them all; we did not fear even their great champion Achilles, 
<A NAME="84"></A>son of a goddess though he be, as we do this man: his rage is beyond all 
<A NAME="85"></A>bounds, and there is none can vie with him in prowess"
<A NAME="86"></A><BR><BR>Hector did as his brother bade him. He sprang from his chariot, 
<A NAME="87"></A>and went about everywhere among the host, brandishing his spears, urging 
<A NAME="88"></A>the men on to fight, and raising the dread cry of battle. Thereon they 
<A NAME="89"></A>rallied and again faced the Achaeans, who gave ground and ceased their 
<A NAME="90"></A>murderous onset, for they deemed that some one of the immortals had come 
<A NAME="91"></A>down from starry heaven to help the Trojans, so strangely had they rallied. 
<A NAME="92"></A>And Hector shouted to the Trojans, "Trojans and allies, be men, my friends, 
<A NAME="93"></A>and fight with might and main, while I go to Ilius and tell the old men 
<A NAME="94"></A>of our council and our wives to pray to the gods and vow hecatombs in their 
<A NAME="95"></A>honour."
<A NAME="96"></A><BR><BR>With this he went his way, and the black rim of hide that went 
<A NAME="97"></A>round his shield beat against his neck and his ancles.
<A NAME="98"></A><BR><BR>Then Glaucus son of Hippolochus, and the son of Tydeus went into 
<A NAME="99"></A>the open space between the hosts to fight in single combat. When they were 
<A NAME="100"></A>close up to one another Diomed of the loud war-cry was the first to speak. 
<A NAME="101"></A>"Who, my good sir," said he, "who are you among men? I have never seen 
<A NAME="102"></A>you in battle until now, but you are daring beyond all others if you abide 
<A NAME="103"></A>my onset. Woe to those fathers whose sons face my might. If, however, you 
<A NAME="104"></A>are one of the immortals and have come down from heaven, I will not fight 
<A NAME="105"></A>you; for even valiant Lycurgus, son of Dryas, did not live long when he 
<A NAME="106"></A>took to fighting with the gods. He it was that drove the nursing women 
<A NAME="107"></A>who were in charge of frenzied Bacchus through the land of Nysa, and they 
<A NAME="108"></A>flung their thyrsi on the ground as murderous Lycurgus beat them with his 
<A NAME="109"></A>oxgoad. Bacchus himself plunged terror-stricken into the sea, and Thetis 
<A NAME="110"></A>took him to her bosom to comfort him, for he was scared by the fury with 
<A NAME="111"></A>which the man reviled him. Thereon the gods who live at ease were angry 
<A NAME="112"></A>with Lycurgus and the son of Saturn struck him blind, nor did he live much 
<A NAME="113"></A>longer after he had become hateful to the immortals. Therefore I will not 
<A NAME="114"></A>fight with the blessed gods; but if you are of them that eat the fruit 
<A NAME="115"></A>of the ground, draw near and meet your doom."
<A NAME="116"></A><BR><BR>And the son of Hippolochus answered, son of Tydeus, why ask me 
<A NAME="117"></A>of my lineage? Men come and go as leaves year by year upon the trees. Those 
<A NAME="118"></A>of autumn the wind sheds upon the ground, but when spring returns the forest 
<A NAME="119"></A>buds forth with fresh vines. Even so is it with the generations of mankind, 
<A NAME="120"></A>the new spring up as the old are passing away. If, then, you would learn 
<A NAME="121"></A>my descent, it is one that is well known to many. There is a city in the 
<A NAME="122"></A>heart of Argos, pasture land of horses, called Ephyra, where Sisyphus lived, 
<A NAME="123"></A>who was the craftiest of all mankind. He was the son of Aeolus, and had 
<A NAME="124"></A>a son named Glaucus, who was father to Bellerophon, whom heaven endowed 
<A NAME="125"></A>with the most surpassing comeliness and beauty. But Proetus devised his 
<A NAME="126"></A>ruin, and being stronger than he, drove him from the land of the Argives, 
<A NAME="127"></A>over which Jove had made him ruler. For Antea, wife of Proetus, lusted 
<A NAME="128"></A>after him, and would have had him lie with her in secret; but Bellerophon 
<A NAME="129"></A>was an honourable man and would not, so she told lies about him to Proteus. 
<A NAME="130"></A>'Proetus,' said she, 'kill Bellerophon or die, for he would have had converse 
<A NAME="131"></A>with me against my will.' The king was angered, but shrank from killing 
<A NAME="132"></A>Bellerophon, so he sent him to Lycia with lying letters of introduction, 
<A NAME="133"></A>written on a folded tablet, and containing much ill against the bearer. 
<A NAME="134"></A>He bade Bellerophon show these letters to his father-in-law, to the end 
<A NAME="135"></A>that he might thus perish; Bellerophon therefore went to Lycia, and the 
<A NAME="136"></A>gods convoyed him safely.
<A NAME="137"></A><BR><BR>"When he reached the river Xanthus, which is in Lycia, the king 
<A NAME="138"></A>received him with all goodwill, feasted him nine days, and killed nine 
<A NAME="139"></A>heifers in his honour, but when rosy-fingered morning appeared upon the 
<A NAME="140"></A>tenth day, he questioned him and desired to see the letter from his son-in-law 
<A NAME="141"></A>Proetus. When he had received the wicked letter he first commanded Bellerophon 
<A NAME="142"></A>to kill that savage monster, the Chimaera, who was not a human being, but 
<A NAME="143"></A>a goddess, for she had the head of a lion and the tail of a serpent, while 
<A NAME="144"></A>her body was that of a goat, and she breathed forth flames of fire; but 
<A NAME="145"></A>Bellerophon slew her, for he was guided by signs from heaven. He next fought 
<A NAME="146"></A>the far-famed Solymi, and this, he said, was the hardest of all his battles. 
<A NAME="147"></A>Thirdly, he killed the Amazons, women who were the peers of men, and as 
<A NAME="148"></A>he was returning thence the king devised yet another plan for his destruction; 
<A NAME="149"></A>he picked the bravest warriors in all Lycia, and placed them in ambuscade, 
<A NAME="150"></A>but not a man ever came back, for Bellerophon killed every one of them. 
<A NAME="151"></A>Then the king knew that he must be the valiant offspring of a god, so he 
<A NAME="152"></A>kept him in Lycia, gave him his daughter in marriage, and made him of equal 
<A NAME="153"></A>honour in the kingdom with himself; and the Lycians gave him a piece of 
<A NAME="154"></A>land, the best in all the country, fair with vineyards and tilled fields, 
<A NAME="155"></A>to have and to hold.
<A NAME="156"></A><BR><BR>"The king's daughter bore Bellerophon three children, Isander, 
<A NAME="157"></A>Hippolochus, and Laodameia. Jove, the lord of counsel, lay with Laodameia, 
<A NAME="158"></A>and she bore him noble Sarpedon; but when Bellerophon came to be hated 
<A NAME="159"></A>by all the gods, he wandered all desolate and dismayed upon the Alean plain, 
<A NAME="160"></A>gnawing at his own heart, and shunning the path of man. Mars, insatiate 
<A NAME="161"></A>of battle, killed his son Isander while he was fighting the Solymi; his 
<A NAME="162"></A>daughter was killed by Diana of the golden reins, for she was angered with 
<A NAME="163"></A>her; but Hippolochus was father to myself, and when he sent me to Troy 
<A NAME="164"></A>he urged me again and again to fight ever among the foremost and outvie 
<A NAME="165"></A>my peers, so as not to shame the blood of my fathers who were the noblest 
<A NAME="166"></A>in Ephyra and in all Lycia. This, then, is the descent I 
<A NAME="167"></A>claim."
<A NAME="168"></A><BR><BR>Thus did he speak, and the heart of Diomed was glad. He planted 
<A NAME="169"></A>his spear in the ground, and spoke to him with friendly words. "Then," 
<A NAME="170"></A>he said, you are an old friend of my father's house. Great Oeneus once 
<A NAME="171"></A>entertained Bellerophon for twenty days, and the two exchanged presents. 
<A NAME="172"></A>Oeneus gave a belt rich with purple, and Bellerophon a double cup, which 
<A NAME="173"></A>I left at home when I set out for Troy. I do not remember Tydeus, for he 
<A NAME="174"></A>was taken from us while I was yet a child, when the army of the Achaeans 
<A NAME="175"></A>was cut to pieces before Thebes. Henceforth, however, I must be your host 
<A NAME="176"></A>in middle Argos, and you mine in Lycia, if I should ever go there; let 
<A NAME="177"></A>us avoid one another's spears even during a general engagement; there are 
<A NAME="178"></A>many noble Trojans and allies whom I can kill, if I overtake them and heaven 
<A NAME="179"></A>delivers them into my hand; so again with yourself, there are many Achaeans 
<A NAME="180"></A>whose lives you may take if you can; we two, then, will exchange armour, 
<A NAME="181"></A>that all present may know of the old ties that subsist between 
<A NAME="182"></A>us."
<A NAME="183"></A><BR><BR>With these words they sprang from their chariots, grasped one another's 
<A NAME="184"></A>hands, and plighted friendship. But the son of Saturn made Glaucus take 
<A NAME="185"></A>leave of his wits, for he exchanged golden armour for bronze, the worth 
<A NAME="186"></A>of a hundred head of cattle for the worth of nine.
<A NAME="187"></A><BR><BR>Now when Hector reached the Scaean gates and the oak tree, the 
<A NAME="188"></A>wives and daughters of the Trojans came running towards him to ask after 
<A NAME="189"></A>their sons, brothers, kinsmen, and husbands: he told them to set about 
<A NAME="190"></A>praying to the gods, and many were made sorrowful as they heard 
<A NAME="191"></A>him.
<A NAME="192"></A><BR><BR>Presently he reached the splendid palace of King Priam, adorned 
<A NAME="193"></A>with colonnades of hewn stone. In it there were fifty bedchambers- all 
<A NAME="194"></A>of hewn stone- built near one another, where the sons of Priam slept, each 
<A NAME="195"></A>with his wedded wife. Opposite these, on the other side the courtyard, 
<A NAME="196"></A>there were twelve upper rooms also of hewn stone for Priam's daughters, 
<A NAME="197"></A>built near one another, where his sons-in-law slept with their wives. When 
<A NAME="198"></A>Hector got there, his fond mother came up to him with Laodice the fairest 
<A NAME="199"></A>of her daughters. She took his hand within her own and said, "My son, why 
<A NAME="200"></A>have you left the battle to come hither? Are the Achaeans, woe betide them, 
<A NAME="201"></A>pressing you hard about the city that you have thought fit to come and 
<A NAME="202"></A>uplift your hands to Jove from the citadel? Wait till I can bring you wine 
<A NAME="203"></A>that you may make offering to Jove and to the other immortals, and may 
<A NAME="204"></A>then drink and be refreshed. Wine gives a man fresh strength when he is 
<A NAME="205"></A>wearied, as you now are with fighting on behalf of your 
<A NAME="206"></A>kinsmen."
<A NAME="207"></A><BR><BR>And Hector answered, "Honoured mother, bring no wine, lest you 
<A NAME="208"></A>unman me and I forget my strength. I dare not make a drink-offering to 
<A NAME="209"></A>Jove with unwashed hands; one who is bespattered with blood and filth may 
<A NAME="210"></A>not pray to the son of Saturn. Get the matrons together, and go with offerings 
<A NAME="211"></A>to the temple of Minerva driver of the spoil; there, upon the knees of 
<A NAME="212"></A>Minerva, lay the largest and fairest robe you have in your house- the one 
<A NAME="213"></A>you set most store by; promise, moreover, to sacrifice twelve yearling 
<A NAME="214"></A>heifers that have never yet felt the goad, in the temple of the goddess 
<A NAME="215"></A>if she will take pity on the town, with the wives and little ones of the 
<A NAME="216"></A>Trojans, and keep the son of Tydeus from off the goodly city of Ilius, 
<A NAME="217"></A>for he fights with fury, and fills men's souls with panic. Go, then, to 
<A NAME="218"></A>the temple of Minerva, while I seek Paris and exhort him, if he will hear 
<A NAME="219"></A>my words. Would that the earth might open her jaws and swallow him, for 
<A NAME="220"></A>Jove bred him to be the bane of the Trojans, and of Priam and Priam's sons. 
<A NAME="221"></A>Could I but see him go down into the house of Hades, my heart would forget 
<A NAME="222"></A>its heaviness."
<A NAME="223"></A><BR><BR>His mother went into the house and called her waiting-women who 
<A NAME="224"></A>gathered the matrons throughout the city. She then went down into her fragrant 
<A NAME="225"></A>store-room, where her embroidered robes were kept, the work of Sidonian 
<A NAME="226"></A>women, whom Alexandrus had brought over from Sidon when he sailed the seas 
<A NAME="227"></A>upon that voyage during which he carried off Helen. Hecuba took out the 
<A NAME="228"></A>largest robe, and the one that was most beautifully enriched with embroidery, 
<A NAME="229"></A>as an offering to Minerva: it glittered like a star, and lay at the very 
<A NAME="230"></A>bottom of the chest. With this she went on her way and many matrons with 
<A NAME="231"></A>her.
<A NAME="232"></A><BR><BR>When they reached the temple of Minerva, lovely Theano, daughter 
<A NAME="233"></A>of Cisseus and wife of Antenor, opened the doors, for the Trojans had made 
<A NAME="234"></A>her priestess of Minerva. The women lifted up their hands to the goddess 
<A NAME="235"></A>with a loud cry, and Theano took the robe to lay it upon the knees of Minerva, 
<A NAME="236"></A>praying the while to the daughter of great Jove. "Holy Minerva," she cried, 
<A NAME="237"></A>"protectress of our city, mighty goddess, break the spear of Diomed and 
<A NAME="238"></A>lay him low before the Scaean gates. Do this, and we will sacrifice twelve 
<A NAME="239"></A>heifers that have never yet known the goad, in your temple, if you will 
<A NAME="240"></A>have pity upon the town, with the wives and little ones If the Trojans." 
<A NAME="241"></A>Thus she prayed, but Pallas Minerva granted not her 
<A NAME="242"></A>prayer.
<A NAME="243"></A><BR><BR>While they were thus praying to the daughter of great Jove, Hector 
<A NAME="244"></A>went to the fair house of Alexandrus, which he had built for him by the 
<A NAME="245"></A>foremost builders in the land. They had built him his house, storehouse, 
<A NAME="246"></A>and courtyard near those of Priam and Hector on the acropolis. Here Hector 
<A NAME="247"></A>entered, with a spear eleven cubits long in his hand; the bronze point 
<A NAME="248"></A>gleamed in front of him, and was fastened to the shaft of the spear by 
<A NAME="249"></A>a ring of gold. He found Alexandrus within the house, busied about his 
<A NAME="250"></A>armour, his shield and cuirass, and handling his curved bow; there, too, 
<A NAME="251"></A>sat Argive Helen with her women, setting them their several tasks; and 
<A NAME="252"></A>as Hector saw him he rebuked him with words of scorn. "Sir," said he, "you 
<A NAME="253"></A>do ill to nurse this rancour; the people perish fighting round this our 
<A NAME="254"></A>town; you would yourself chide one whom you saw shirking his part in the 
<A NAME="255"></A>combat. Up then, or ere long the city will be in a blaze."
<A NAME="256"></A><BR><BR>And Alexandrus answered, "Hector, your rebuke is just; listen therefore, 
<A NAME="257"></A>and believe me when I tell you that I am not here so much through rancour 
<A NAME="258"></A>or ill-will towards the Trojans, as from a desire to indulge my grief. 
<A NAME="259"></A>My wife was even now gently urging me to battle, and I hold it better that 
<A NAME="260"></A>I should go, for victory is ever fickle. Wait, then, while I put on my 
<A NAME="261"></A>armour, or go first and I will follow. I shall be sure to overtake 
<A NAME="262"></A>you."
<A NAME="263"></A><BR><BR>Hector made no answer, but Helen tried to soothe him. "Brother," 
<A NAME="264"></A>said she, "to my abhorred and sinful self, would that a whirlwind had caught 
<A NAME="265"></A>me up on the day my mother brought me forth, and had borne me to some mountain 
<A NAME="266"></A>or to the waves of the roaring sea that should have swept me away ere this 
<A NAME="267"></A>mischief had come about. But, since the gods have devised these evils, 
<A NAME="268"></A>would, at any rate, that I had been wife to a better man- to one who could 
<A NAME="269"></A>smart under dishonour and men's evil speeches. This fellow was never yet 
<A NAME="270"></A>to be depended upon, nor never will be, and he will surely reap what he 
<A NAME="271"></A>has sown. Still, brother, come in and rest upon this seat, for it is you 
<A NAME="272"></A>who bear the brunt of that toil that has been caused by my hateful self 
<A NAME="273"></A>and by the sin of Alexandrus- both of whom Jove has doomed to be a theme 
<A NAME="274"></A>of song among those that shall be born hereafter."
<A NAME="275"></A><BR><BR>And Hector answered, "Bid me not be seated, Helen, for all the 
<A NAME="276"></A>goodwill you bear me. I cannot stay. I am in haste to help the Trojans, 
<A NAME="277"></A>who miss me greatly when I am not among them; but urge your husband, and 
<A NAME="278"></A>of his own self also let him make haste to overtake me before I am out 
<A NAME="279"></A>of the city. I must go home to see my household, my wife and my little 
<A NAME="280"></A>son, for I know not whether I shall ever again return to them, or whether 
<A NAME="281"></A>the gods will cause me to fill by the hands of the Achaeans."
<A NAME="282"></A><BR><BR>Then Hector left her, and forthwith was at his own house. He did 
<A NAME="283"></A>not find Andromache, for she was on the wall with her child and one of 
<A NAME="284"></A>her maids, weeping bitterly. Seeing, then, that she was not within, he 
<A NAME="285"></A>stood on the threshold of the women's rooms and said, "Women, tell me, 
<A NAME="286"></A>and tell me true, where did Andromache go when she left the house? Was 
<A NAME="287"></A>it to my sisters, or to my brothers' wives? or is she at the temple of 
<A NAME="288"></A>Minerva where the other women are propitiating the awful 
<A NAME="289"></A>goddess?"
<A NAME="290"></A><BR><BR>His good housekeeper answered, "Hector, since you bid me tell you 
<A NAME="291"></A>truly, she did not go to your sisters nor to your brothers' wives, nor 
<A NAME="292"></A>yet to the temple of Minerva, where the other women are propitiating the 
<A NAME="293"></A>awful goddess, but she is on the high wall of Ilius, for she had heard 
<A NAME="294"></A>the Trojans were being hard pressed, and that the Achaeans were in great 
<A NAME="295"></A>force: she went to the wall in frenzied haste, and the nurse went with 
<A NAME="296"></A>her carrying the child."
<A NAME="297"></A><BR><BR>Hector hurried from the house when she had done speaking, and went 
<A NAME="298"></A>down the streets by the same way that he had come. When he had gone through 
<A NAME="299"></A>the city and had reached the Scaean gates through which he would go out 
<A NAME="300"></A>on to the plain, his wife came running towards him, Andromache, daughter 
<A NAME="301"></A>of great Eetion who ruled in Thebe under the wooded slopes of Mt. Placus, 
<A NAME="302"></A>and was king of the Cilicians. His daughter had married Hector, and now 
<A NAME="303"></A>came to meet him with a nurse who carried his little child in her bosom- 
<A NAME="304"></A>a mere babe. Hector's darling son, and lovely as a star. Hector had named 
<A NAME="305"></A>him Scamandrius, but the people called him Astyanax, for his father stood 
<A NAME="306"></A>alone as chief guardian of Ilius. Hector smiled as he looked upon the boy, 
<A NAME="307"></A>but he did not speak, and Andromache stood by him weeping and taking his 
<A NAME="308"></A>hand in her own. "Dear husband," said she, "your valour will bring you 
<A NAME="309"></A>to destruction; think on your infant son, and on my hapless self who ere 
<A NAME="310"></A>long shall be your widow- for the Achaeans will set upon you in a body 
<A NAME="311"></A>and kill you. It would be better for me, should I lose you, to lie dead 
<A NAME="312"></A>and buried, for I shall have nothing left to comfort me when you are gone, 
<A NAME="313"></A>save only sorrow. I have neither father nor mother now. Achilles slew my 
<A NAME="314"></A>father when he sacked Thebe the goodly city of the Cilicians. He slew him, 
<A NAME="315"></A>but did not for very shame despoil him; when he had burned him in his wondrous 
<A NAME="316"></A>armour, he raised a barrow over his ashes and the mountain nymphs, daughters 
<A NAME="317"></A>of aegis-bearing Jove, planted a grove of elms about his tomb. I had seven 
<A NAME="318"></A>brothers in my father's house, but on the same day they all went within 
<A NAME="319"></A>the house of Hades. Achilles killed them as they were with their sheep 
<A NAME="320"></A>and cattle. My mother- her who had been queen of all the land under Mt. 
<A NAME="321"></A>Placus- he brought hither with the spoil, and freed her for a great sum, 
<A NAME="322"></A>but the archer- queen Diana took her in the house of your father. Nay- 
<A NAME="323"></A>Hector- you who to me are father, mother, brother, and dear husband- have 
<A NAME="324"></A>mercy upon me; stay here upon this wall; make not your child fatherless, 
<A NAME="325"></A>and your wife a widow; as for the host, place them near the fig-tree, where 
<A NAME="326"></A>the city can be best scaled, and the wall is weakest. Thrice have the bravest 
<A NAME="327"></A>of them come thither and assailed it, under the two Ajaxes, Idomeneus, 
<A NAME="328"></A>the sons of Atreus, and the brave son of Tydeus, either of their own bidding, 
<A NAME="329"></A>or because some soothsayer had told them."
<A NAME="330"></A><BR><BR>And Hector answered, "Wife, I too have thought upon all this, but 
<A NAME="331"></A>with what face should I look upon the Trojans, men or women, if I shirked 
<A NAME="332"></A>battle like a coward? I cannot do so: I know nothing save to fight bravely 
<A NAME="333"></A>in the forefront of the Trojan host and win renown alike for my father 
<A NAME="334"></A>and myself. Well do I know that the day will surely come when mighty Ilius 
<A NAME="335"></A>shall be destroyed with Priam and Priam's people, but I grieve for none 
<A NAME="336"></A>of these- not even for Hecuba, nor King Priam, nor for my brothers many 
<A NAME="337"></A>and brave who may fall in the dust before their foes- for none of these 
<A NAME="338"></A>do I grieve as for yourself when the day shall come on which some one of 
<A NAME="339"></A>the Achaeans shall rob you for ever of your freedom, and bear you weeping 
<A NAME="340"></A>away. It may be that you will have to ply the loom in Argos at the bidding 
<A NAME="341"></A>of a mistress, or to fetch water from the springs Messeis or Hypereia, 
<A NAME="342"></A>treated brutally by some cruel task-master; then will one say who sees 
<A NAME="343"></A>you weeping, 'She was wife to Hector, the bravest warrior among the Trojans 
<A NAME="344"></A>during the war before Ilius.' On this your tears will break forth anew 
<A NAME="345"></A>for him who would have put away the day of captivity from you. May I lie 
<A NAME="346"></A>dead under the barrow that is heaped over my body ere I hear your cry as 
<A NAME="347"></A>they carry you into bondage."
<A NAME="348"></A><BR><BR>He stretched his arms towards his child, but the boy cried and 
<A NAME="349"></A>nestled in his nurse's bosom, scared at the sight of his father's armour, 
<A NAME="350"></A>and at the horse-hair plume that nodded fiercely from his helmet. His father 
<A NAME="351"></A>and mother laughed to see him, but Hector took the helmet from his head 
<A NAME="352"></A>and laid it all gleaming upon the ground. Then he took his darling child, 
<A NAME="353"></A>kissed him, and dandled him in his arms, praying over him the while to 
<A NAME="354"></A>Jove and to all the gods. "Jove," he cried, "grant that this my child may 
<A NAME="355"></A>be even as myself, chief among the Trojans; let him be not less excellent 
<A NAME="356"></A>in strength, and let him rule Ilius with his might. Then may one say of 
<A NAME="357"></A>him as he comes from battle, 'The son is far better than the father.' May 
<A NAME="358"></A>he bring back the blood-stained spoils of him whom he has laid low, and 
<A NAME="359"></A>let his mother's heart be glad.'"
<A NAME="360"></A><BR><BR>With this he laid the child again in the arms of his wife, who 
<A NAME="361"></A>took him to her own soft bosom, smiling through her tears. As her husband 
<A NAME="362"></A>watched her his heart yearned towards her and he caressed her fondly, saying, 
<A NAME="363"></A>"My own wife, do not take these things too bitterly to heart. No one can 
<A NAME="364"></A>hurry me down to Hades before my time, but if a man's hour is come, be 
<A NAME="365"></A>he brave or be he coward, there is no escape for him when he has once been 
<A NAME="366"></A>born. Go, then, within the house, and busy yourself with your daily duties, 
<A NAME="367"></A>your loom, your distaff, and the ordering of your servants; for war is 
<A NAME="368"></A>man's matter, and mine above all others of them that have been born in 
<A NAME="369"></A>Ilius."
<A NAME="370"></A><BR><BR>He took his plumed helmet from the ground, and his wife went back 
<A NAME="371"></A>again to her house, weeping bitterly and often looking back towards him. 
<A NAME="372"></A>When she reached her home she found her maidens within, and bade them all 
<A NAME="373"></A>join in her lament; so they mourned Hector in his own house though he was 
<A NAME="374"></A>yet alive, for they deemed that they should never see him return safe from 
<A NAME="375"></A>battle, and from the furious hands of the Achaeans.
<A NAME="376"></A><BR><BR>Paris did not remain long in his house. He donned his goodly armour 
<A NAME="377"></A>overlaid with bronze, and hasted through the city as fast as his feet could 
<A NAME="378"></A>take him. As a horse, stabled and fed, breaks loose and gallops gloriously 
<A NAME="379"></A>over the plain to the place where he is wont to bathe in the fair-flowing 
<A NAME="380"></A>river- he holds his head high, and his mane streams upon his shoulders 
<A NAME="381"></A>as he exults in his strength and flies like the wind to the haunts and 
<A NAME="382"></A>feeding ground of the mares- even so went forth Paris from high Pergamus, 
<A NAME="383"></A>gleaming like sunlight in his armour, and he laughed aloud as he sped swiftly 
<A NAME="384"></A>on his way. Forthwith he came upon his brother Hector, who was then turning 
<A NAME="385"></A>away from the place where he had held converse with his wife, and he was 
<A NAME="386"></A>himself the first to speak. "Sir," said he, "I fear that I have kept you 
<A NAME="387"></A>waiting when you are in haste, and have not come as quickly as you bade 
<A NAME="388"></A>me."
<A NAME="389"></A><BR><BR>"My good brother," answered Hector, you fight bravely, and no man 
<A NAME="390"></A>with any justice can make light of your doings in battle. But you are careless 
<A NAME="391"></A>and wilfully remiss. It grieves me to the heart to hear the ill that the 
<A NAME="392"></A>Trojans speak about you, for they have suffered much on your account. Let 
<A NAME="393"></A>us be going, and we will make things right hereafter, should Jove vouchsafe 
<A NAME="394"></A>us to set the cup of our deliverance before ever-living gods of heaven 
<A NAME="395"></A>in our own homes, when we have chased the Achaeans from 
<A NAME="396"></A>Troy."
