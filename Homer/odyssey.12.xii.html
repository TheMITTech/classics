<A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A>"After we were clear of the river Oceanus, and had got out into the open 
<A NAME="11"></A>sea, we went on till we reached the Aeaean island where there is dawn and 
<A NAME="12"></A>sunrise as in other places. We then drew our ship on to the sands and got 
<A NAME="13"></A>out of her on to the shore, where we went to sleep and waited till day 
<A NAME="14"></A>should break.
<A NAME="15"></A><BR><BR>"Then, when the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, 
<A NAME="16"></A>I sent some men to Circe's house to fetch the body of Elpenor. We cut firewood 
<A NAME="17"></A>from a wood where the headland jutted out into the sea, and after we had 
<A NAME="18"></A>wept over him and lamented him we performed his funeral rites. When his 
<A NAME="19"></A>body and armour had been burned to ashes, we raised a cairn, set a stone 
<A NAME="20"></A>over it, and at the top of the cairn we fixed the oar that he had been 
<A NAME="21"></A>used to row with.
<A NAME="22"></A><BR><BR>"While we were doing all this, Circe, who knew that we had got 
<A NAME="23"></A>back from the house of Hades, dressed herself and came to us as fast as 
<A NAME="24"></A>she could; and her maid servants came with her bringing us bread, meat, 
<A NAME="25"></A>and wine. Then she stood in the midst of us and said, 'You have done a 
<A NAME="26"></A>bold thing in going down alive to the house of Hades, and you will have 
<A NAME="27"></A>died twice, to other people's once; now, then, stay here for the rest of 
<A NAME="28"></A>the day, feast your fill, and go on with your voyage at daybreak tomorrow 
<A NAME="29"></A>morning. In the meantime I will tell Ulysses about your course, and will 
<A NAME="30"></A>explain everything to him so as to prevent your suffering from misadventure 
<A NAME="31"></A>either by land or sea.'
<A NAME="32"></A><BR><BR>"We agreed to do as she had said, and feasted through the livelong 
<A NAME="33"></A>day to the going down of the sun, but when the sun had set and it came 
<A NAME="34"></A>on dark, the men laid themselves down to sleep by the stern cables of the 
<A NAME="35"></A>ship. Then Circe took me by the hand and bade me be seated away from the 
<A NAME="36"></A>others, while she reclined by my side and asked me all about our 
<A NAME="37"></A>adventures.
<A NAME="38"></A><BR><BR>"'So far so good,' said she, when I had ended my story, 'and now 
<A NAME="39"></A>pay attention to what I am about to tell you- heaven itself, indeed, will 
<A NAME="40"></A>recall it to your recollection. First you will come to the Sirens who enchant 
<A NAME="41"></A>all who come near them. If any one unwarily draws in too close and hears 
<A NAME="42"></A>the singing of the Sirens, his wife and children will never welcome him 
<A NAME="43"></A>home again, for they sit in a green field and warble him to death with 
<A NAME="44"></A>the sweetness of their song. There is a great heap of dead men's bones 
<A NAME="45"></A>lying all around, with the flesh still rotting off them. Therefore pass 
<A NAME="46"></A>these Sirens by, and stop your men's ears with wax that none of them may 
<A NAME="47"></A>hear; but if you like you can listen yourself, for you may get the men 
<A NAME="48"></A>to bind you as you stand upright on a cross-piece half way up the mast, 
<A NAME="49"></A>and they must lash the rope's ends to the mast itself, that you may have 
<A NAME="50"></A>the pleasure of listening. If you beg and pray the men to unloose you, 
<A NAME="51"></A>then they must bind you faster.
<A NAME="52"></A><BR><BR>"'When your crew have taken you past these Sirens, I cannot give 
<A NAME="53"></A>you coherent directions as to which of two courses you are to take; I will 
<A NAME="54"></A>lay the two alternatives before you, and you must consider them for yourself. 
<A NAME="55"></A>On the one hand there are some overhanging rocks against which the deep 
<A NAME="56"></A>blue waves of Amphitrite beat with terrific fury; the blessed gods call 
<A NAME="57"></A>these rocks the Wanderers. Here not even a bird may pass, no, not even 
<A NAME="58"></A>the timid doves that bring ambrosia to Father Jove, but the sheer rock 
<A NAME="59"></A>always carries off one of them, and Father Jove has to send another to 
<A NAME="60"></A>make up their number; no ship that ever yet came to these rocks has got 
<A NAME="61"></A>away again, but the waves and whirlwinds of fire are freighted with wreckage 
<A NAME="62"></A>and with the bodies of dead men. The only vessel that ever sailed and got 
<A NAME="63"></A>through, was the famous Argo on her way from the house of Aetes, and she 
<A NAME="64"></A>too would have gone against these great rocks, only that Juno piloted her 
<A NAME="65"></A>past them for the love she bore to Jason.
<A NAME="66"></A><BR><BR>"'Of these two rocks the one reaches heaven and its peak is lost 
<A NAME="67"></A>in a dark cloud. This never leaves it, so that the top is never clear not 
<A NAME="68"></A>even in summer and early autumn. No man though he had twenty hands and 
<A NAME="69"></A>twenty feet could get a foothold on it and climb it, for it runs sheer 
<A NAME="70"></A>up, as smooth as though it had been polished. In the middle of it there 
<A NAME="71"></A>is a large cavern, looking West and turned towards Erebus; you must take 
<A NAME="72"></A>your ship this way, but the cave is so high up that not even the stoutest 
<A NAME="73"></A>archer could send an arrow into it. Inside it Scylla sits and yelps with 
<A NAME="74"></A>a voice that you might take to be that of a young hound, but in truth she 
<A NAME="75"></A>is a dreadful monster and no one- not even a god- could face her without 
<A NAME="76"></A>being terror-struck. She has twelve mis-shapen feet, and six necks of the 
<A NAME="77"></A>most prodigious length; and at the end of each neck she has a frightful 
<A NAME="78"></A>head with three rows of teeth in each, all set very close together, so 
<A NAME="79"></A>that they would crunch any one to death in a moment, and she sits deep 
<A NAME="80"></A>within her shady cell thrusting out her heads and peering all round the 
<A NAME="81"></A>rock, fishing for dolphins or dogfish or any larger monster that she can 
<A NAME="82"></A>catch, of the thousands with which Amphitrite teems. No ship ever yet got 
<A NAME="83"></A>past her without losing some men, for she shoots out all her heads at once, 
<A NAME="84"></A>and carries off a man in each mouth.
<A NAME="85"></A><BR><BR>"'You will find the other rocks lie lower, but they are so close 
<A NAME="86"></A>together that there is not more than a bowshot between them. [A large fig 
<A NAME="87"></A>tree in full leaf grows upon it], and under it lies the sucking whirlpool 
<A NAME="88"></A>of Charybdis. Three times in the day does she vomit forth her waters, and 
<A NAME="89"></A>three times she sucks them down again; see that you be not there when she 
<A NAME="90"></A>is sucking, for if you are, Neptune himself could not save you; you must 
<A NAME="91"></A>hug the Scylla side and drive ship by as fast as you can, for you had better 
<A NAME="92"></A>lose six men than your whole crew.'
<A NAME="93"></A><BR><BR>"'Is there no way,' said I, 'of escaping Charybdis, and at the 
<A NAME="94"></A>same time keeping Scylla off when she is trying to harm my 
<A NAME="95"></A>men?'
<A NAME="96"></A><BR><BR>"'You dare-devil,' replied the goddess, you are always wanting 
<A NAME="97"></A>to fight somebody or something; you will not let yourself be beaten even 
<A NAME="98"></A>by the immortals. For Scylla is not mortal; moreover she is savage, extreme, 
<A NAME="99"></A>rude, cruel and invincible. There is no help for it; your best chance will 
<A NAME="100"></A>be to get by her as fast as ever you can, for if you dawdle about her rock 
<A NAME="101"></A>while you are putting on your armour, she may catch you with a second cast 
<A NAME="102"></A>of her six heads, and snap up another half dozen of your men; so drive 
<A NAME="103"></A>your ship past her at full speed, and roar out lustily to Crataiis who 
<A NAME="104"></A>is Scylla's dam, bad luck to her; she will then stop her from making a 
<A NAME="105"></A>second raid upon you.
<A NAME="106"></A><BR><BR>"'You will now come to the Thrinacian island, and here you will 
<A NAME="107"></A>see many herds of cattle and flocks of sheep belonging to the sun-god- 
<A NAME="108"></A>seven herds of cattle and seven flocks of sheep, with fifty head in each 
<A NAME="109"></A>flock. They do not breed, nor do they become fewer in number, and they 
<A NAME="110"></A>are tended by the goddesses Phaethusa and Lampetie, who are children of 
<A NAME="111"></A>the sun-god Hyperion by Neaera. Their mother when she had borne them and 
<A NAME="112"></A>had done suckling them sent them to the Thrinacian island, which was a 
<A NAME="113"></A>long way off, to live there and look after their father's flocks and herds. 
<A NAME="114"></A>If you leave these flocks unharmed, and think of nothing but getting home, 
<A NAME="115"></A>you may yet after much hardship reach Ithaca; but if you harm them, then 
<A NAME="116"></A>I forewarn you of the destruction both of your ship and of your comrades; 
<A NAME="117"></A>and even though you may yourself escape, you will return late, in bad plight, 
<A NAME="118"></A>after losing all your men.'
<A NAME="119"></A><BR><BR>"Here she ended, and dawn enthroned in gold began to show in heaven, 
<A NAME="120"></A>whereon she returned inland. I then went on board and told my men to loose 
<A NAME="121"></A>the ship from her moorings; so they at once got into her, took their places, 
<A NAME="122"></A>and began to smite the grey sea with their oars. Presently the great and 
<A NAME="123"></A>cunning goddess Circe befriended us with a fair wind that blew dead aft, 
<A NAME="124"></A>and stayed steadily with us, keeping our sails well filled, so we did whatever 
<A NAME="125"></A>wanted doing to the ship's gear, and let her go as wind and helmsman headed 
<A NAME="126"></A>her.
<A NAME="127"></A><BR><BR>"Then, being much troubled in mind, I said to my men, 'My friends, 
<A NAME="128"></A>it is not right that one or two of us alone should know the prophecies 
<A NAME="129"></A>that Circe has made me, I will therefore tell you about them, so that whether 
<A NAME="130"></A>we live or die we may do so with our eyes open. First she said we were 
<A NAME="131"></A>to keep clear of the Sirens, who sit and sing most beautifully in a field 
<A NAME="132"></A>of flowers; but she said I might hear them myself so long as no one else 
<A NAME="133"></A>did. Therefore, take me and bind me to the crosspiece half way up the mast; 
<A NAME="134"></A>bind me as I stand upright, with a bond so fast that I cannot possibly 
<A NAME="135"></A>break away, and lash the rope's ends to the mast itself. If I beg and pray 
<A NAME="136"></A>you to set me free, then bind me more tightly still.'
<A NAME="137"></A><BR><BR>"I had hardly finished telling everything to the men before we 
<A NAME="138"></A>reached the island of the two Sirens, for the wind had been very favourable. 
<A NAME="139"></A>Then all of a sudden it fell dead calm; there was not a breath of wind 
<A NAME="140"></A>nor a ripple upon the water, so the men furled the sails and stowed them; 
<A NAME="141"></A>then taking to their oars they whitened the water with the foam they raised 
<A NAME="142"></A>in rowing. Meanwhile I look a large wheel of wax and cut it up small with 
<A NAME="143"></A>my sword. Then I kneaded the wax in my strong hands till it became soft, 
<A NAME="144"></A>which it soon did between the kneading and the rays of the sun-god son 
<A NAME="145"></A>of Hyperion. Then I stopped the ears of all my men, and they bound me hands 
<A NAME="146"></A>and feet to the mast as I stood upright on the crosspiece; but they went 
<A NAME="147"></A>on rowing themselves. When we had got within earshot of the land, and the 
<A NAME="148"></A>ship was going at a good rate, the Sirens saw that we were getting in shore 
<A NAME="149"></A>and began with their singing.
<A NAME="150"></A><BR><BR>"'Come here,' they sang, 'renowned Ulysses, honour to the Achaean 
<A NAME="151"></A>name, and listen to our two voices. No one ever sailed past us without 
<A NAME="152"></A>staying to hear the enchanting sweetness of our song- and he who listens 
<A NAME="153"></A>will go on his way not only charmed, but wiser, for we know all the ills 
<A NAME="154"></A>that the gods laid upon the Argives and Trojans before Troy, and can tell 
<A NAME="155"></A>you everything that is going to happen over the whole 
<A NAME="156"></A>world.'
<A NAME="157"></A><BR><BR>"They sang these words most musically, and as I longed to hear 
<A NAME="158"></A>them further I made by frowning to my men that they should set me free; 
<A NAME="159"></A>but they quickened their stroke, and Eurylochus and Perimedes bound me 
<A NAME="160"></A>with still stronger bonds till we had got out of hearing of the Sirens' 
<A NAME="161"></A>voices. Then my men took the wax from their ears and unbound 
<A NAME="162"></A>me.
<A NAME="163"></A><BR><BR>"Immediately after we had got past the island I saw a great wave 
<A NAME="164"></A>from which spray was rising, and I heard a loud roaring sound. The men 
<A NAME="165"></A>were so frightened that they loosed hold of their oars, for the whole sea 
<A NAME="166"></A>resounded with the rushing of the waters, but the ship stayed where it 
<A NAME="167"></A>was, for the men had left off rowing. I went round, therefore, and exhorted 
<A NAME="168"></A>them man by man not to lose heart.
<A NAME="169"></A><BR><BR>"'My friends,' said I, 'this is not the first time that we have 
<A NAME="170"></A>been in danger, and we are in nothing like so bad a case as when the Cyclops 
<A NAME="171"></A>shut us up in his cave; nevertheless, my courage and wise counsel saved 
<A NAME="172"></A>us then, and we shall live to look back on all this as well. Now, therefore, 
<A NAME="173"></A>let us all do as I say, trust in Jove and row on with might and main. As 
<A NAME="174"></A>for you, coxswain, these are your orders; attend to them, for the ship 
<A NAME="175"></A>is in your hands; turn her head away from these steaming rapids and hug 
<A NAME="176"></A>the rock, or she will give you the slip and be over yonder before you know 
<A NAME="177"></A>where you are, and you will be the death of us.'
<A NAME="178"></A><BR><BR>"So they did as I told them; but I said nothing about the awful 
<A NAME="179"></A>monster Scylla, for I knew the men would not on rowing if I did, but would 
<A NAME="180"></A>huddle together in the hold. In one thing only did I disobey Circe's strict 
<A NAME="181"></A>instructions- I put on my armour. Then seizing two strong spears I took 
<A NAME="182"></A>my stand on the ship Is bows, for it was there that I expected first to 
<A NAME="183"></A>see the monster of the rock, who was to do my men so much harm; but I could 
<A NAME="184"></A>not make her out anywhere, though I strained my eyes with looking the gloomy 
<A NAME="185"></A>rock all over and over
<A NAME="186"></A><BR><BR>"Then we entered the Straits in great fear of mind, for on the 
<A NAME="187"></A>one hand was Scylla, and on the other dread Charybdis kept sucking up the 
<A NAME="188"></A>salt water. As she vomited it up, it was like the water in a cauldron when 
<A NAME="189"></A>it is boiling over upon a great fire, and the spray reached the top of 
<A NAME="190"></A>the rocks on either side. When she began to suck again, we could see the 
<A NAME="191"></A>water all inside whirling round and round, and it made a deafening sound 
<A NAME="192"></A>as it broke against the rocks. We could see the bottom of the whirlpool 
<A NAME="193"></A>all black with sand and mud, and the men were at their wit's ends for fear. 
<A NAME="194"></A>While we were taken up with this, and were expecting each moment to be 
<A NAME="195"></A>our last, Scylla pounced down suddenly upon us and snatched up my six best 
<A NAME="196"></A>men. I was looking at once after both ship and men, and in a moment I saw 
<A NAME="197"></A>their hands and feet ever so high above me, struggling in the air as Scylla 
<A NAME="198"></A>was carrying them off, and I heard them call out my name in one last despairing 
<A NAME="199"></A>cry. As a fisherman, seated, spear in hand, upon some jutting rock throws 
<A NAME="200"></A>bait into the water to deceive the poor little fishes, and spears them 
<A NAME="201"></A>with the ox's horn with which his spear is shod, throwing them gasping 
<A NAME="202"></A>on to the land as he catches them one by one- even so did Scylla land these 
<A NAME="203"></A>panting creatures on her rock and munch them up at the mouth of her den, 
<A NAME="204"></A>while they screamed and stretched out their hands to me in their mortal 
<A NAME="205"></A>agony. This was the most sickening sight that I saw throughout all my 
<A NAME="206"></A>voyages.
<A NAME="207"></A><BR><BR>"When we had passed the [Wandering] rocks, with Scylla and terrible 
<A NAME="208"></A>Charybdis, we reached the noble island of the sun-god, where were the goodly 
<A NAME="209"></A>cattle and sheep belonging to the sun Hyperion. While still at sea in my 
<A NAME="210"></A>ship I could bear the cattle lowing as they came home to the yards, and 
<A NAME="211"></A>the sheep bleating. Then I remembered what the blind Theban prophet Teiresias 
<A NAME="212"></A>had told me, and how carefully Aeaean Circe had warned me to shun the island 
<A NAME="213"></A>of the blessed sun-god. So being much troubled I said to the men, 'My men, 
<A NAME="214"></A>I know you are hard pressed, but listen while I tell you the prophecy that 
<A NAME="215"></A>Teiresias made me, and how carefully Aeaean Circe warned me to shun the 
<A NAME="216"></A>island of the blessed sun-god, for it was here, she said, that our worst 
<A NAME="217"></A>danger would lie. Head the ship, therefore, away from the 
<A NAME="218"></A>island.'
<A NAME="219"></A><BR><BR>"The men were in despair at this, and Eurylochus at once gave me 
<A NAME="220"></A>an insolent answer. 'Ulysses,' said he, 'you are cruel; you are very strong 
<A NAME="221"></A>yourself and never get worn out; you seem to be made of iron, and now, 
<A NAME="222"></A>though your men are exhausted with toil and want of sleep, you will not 
<A NAME="223"></A>let them land and cook themselves a good supper upon this island, but bid 
<A NAME="224"></A>them put out to sea and go faring fruitlessly on through the watches of 
<A NAME="225"></A>the flying night. It is by night that the winds blow hardest and do so 
<A NAME="226"></A>much damage; how can we escape should one of those sudden squalls spring 
<A NAME="227"></A>up from South West or West, which so often wreck a vessel when our lords 
<A NAME="228"></A>the gods are unpropitious? Now, therefore, let us obey the of night and 
<A NAME="229"></A>prepare our supper here hard by the ship; to-morrow morning we will go 
<A NAME="230"></A>on board again and put out to sea.'
<A NAME="231"></A><BR><BR>"Thus spoke Eurylochus, and the men approved his words. I saw that 
<A NAME="232"></A>heaven meant us a mischief and said, 'You force me to yield, for you are 
<A NAME="233"></A>many against one, but at any rate each one of you must take his solemn 
<A NAME="234"></A>oath that if he meet with a herd of cattle or a large flock of sheep, he 
<A NAME="235"></A>will not be so mad as to kill a single head of either, but will be satisfied 
<A NAME="236"></A>with the food that Circe has given us.'
<A NAME="237"></A><BR><BR>"They all swore as I bade them, and when they had completed their 
<A NAME="238"></A>oath we made the ship fast in a harbour that was near a stream of fresh 
<A NAME="239"></A>water, and the men went ashore and cooked their suppers. As soon as they 
<A NAME="240"></A>had had enough to eat and drink, they began talking about their poor comrades 
<A NAME="241"></A>whom Scylla had snatched up and eaten; this set them weeping and they went 
<A NAME="242"></A>on crying till they fell off into a sound sleep.
<A NAME="243"></A><BR><BR>"In the third watch of the night when the stars had shifted their 
<A NAME="244"></A>places, Jove raised a great gale of wind that flew a hurricane so that 
<A NAME="245"></A>land and sea were covered with thick clouds, and night sprang forth out 
<A NAME="246"></A>of the heavens. When the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, 
<A NAME="247"></A>we brought the ship to land and drew her into a cave wherein the sea-nymphs 
<A NAME="248"></A>hold their courts and dances, and I called the men together in 
<A NAME="249"></A>council.
<A NAME="250"></A><BR><BR>"'My friends,' said I, 'we have meat and drink in the ship, let 
<A NAME="251"></A>us mind, therefore, and not touch the cattle, or we shall suffer for it; 
<A NAME="252"></A>for these cattle and sheep belong to the mighty sun, who sees and gives 
<A NAME="253"></A>ear to everything. And again they promised that they would 
<A NAME="254"></A>obey.
<A NAME="255"></A><BR><BR>"For a whole month the wind blew steadily from the South, and there 
<A NAME="256"></A>was no other wind, but only South and East. As long as corn and wine held 
<A NAME="257"></A>out the men did not touch the cattle when they were hungry; when, however, 
<A NAME="258"></A>they had eaten all there was in the ship, they were forced to go further 
<A NAME="259"></A>afield, with hook and line, catching birds, and taking whatever they could 
<A NAME="260"></A>lay their hands on; for they were starving. One day, therefore, I went 
<A NAME="261"></A>up inland that I might pray heaven to show me some means of getting away. 
<A NAME="262"></A>When I had gone far enough to be clear of all my men, and had found a place 
<A NAME="263"></A>that was well sheltered from the wind, I washed my hands and prayed to 
<A NAME="264"></A>all the gods in Olympus till by and by they sent me off into a sweet 
<A NAME="265"></A>sleep.
<A NAME="266"></A><BR><BR>"Meanwhile Eurylochus had been giving evil counsel to the men, 
<A NAME="267"></A>'Listen to me,' said he, 'my poor comrades. All deaths are bad enough but 
<A NAME="268"></A>there is none so bad as famine. Why should not we drive in the best of 
<A NAME="269"></A>these cows and offer them in sacrifice to the immortal Rods? If we ever 
<A NAME="270"></A>get back to Ithaca, we can build a fine temple to the sun-god and enrich 
<A NAME="271"></A>it with every kind of ornament; if, however, he is determined to sink our 
<A NAME="272"></A>ship out of revenge for these homed cattle, and the other gods are of the 
<A NAME="273"></A>same mind, I for one would rather drink salt water once for all and have 
<A NAME="274"></A>done with it, than be starved to death by inches in such a desert island 
<A NAME="275"></A>as this is.'
<A NAME="276"></A><BR><BR>"Thus spoke Eurylochus, and the men approved his words. Now the 
<A NAME="277"></A>cattle, so fair and goodly, were feeding not far from the ship; the men, 
<A NAME="278"></A>therefore drove in the best of them, and they all stood round them saying 
<A NAME="279"></A>their prayers, and using young oak-shoots instead of barley-meal, for there 
<A NAME="280"></A>was no barley left. When they had done praying they killed the cows and 
<A NAME="281"></A>dressed their carcasses; they cut out the thigh bones, wrapped them round 
<A NAME="282"></A>in two layers of fat, and set some pieces of raw meat on top of them. They 
<A NAME="283"></A>had no wine with which to make drink-offerings over the sacrifice while 
<A NAME="284"></A>it was cooking, so they kept pouring on a little water from time to time 
<A NAME="285"></A>while the inward meats were being grilled; then, when the thigh bones were 
<A NAME="286"></A>burned and they had tasted the inward meats, they cut the rest up small 
<A NAME="287"></A>and put the pieces upon the spits.
<A NAME="288"></A><BR><BR>"By this time my deep sleep had left me, and I turned back to the 
<A NAME="289"></A>ship and to the sea shore. As I drew near I began to smell hot roast meat, 
<A NAME="290"></A>so I groaned out a prayer to the immortal gods. 'Father Jove,' I exclaimed, 
<A NAME="291"></A>'and all you other gods who live in everlasting bliss, you have done me 
<A NAME="292"></A>a cruel mischief by the sleep into which you have sent me; see what fine 
<A NAME="293"></A>work these men of mine have been making in my absence.'
<A NAME="294"></A><BR><BR>"Meanwhile Lampetie went straight off to the sun and told him we 
<A NAME="295"></A>had been killing his cows, whereon he flew into a great rage, and said 
<A NAME="296"></A>to the immortals, 'Father Jove, and all you other gods who live in everlasting 
<A NAME="297"></A>bliss, I must have vengeance on the crew of Ulysses' ship: they have had 
<A NAME="298"></A>the insolence to kill my cows, which were the one thing I loved to look 
<A NAME="299"></A>upon, whether I was going up heaven or down again. If they do not square 
<A NAME="300"></A>accounts with me about my cows, I will go down to Hades and shine there 
<A NAME="301"></A>among the dead.'
<A NAME="302"></A><BR><BR>"'Sun,' said Jove, 'go on shining upon us gods and upon mankind 
<A NAME="303"></A>over the fruitful earth. I will shiver their ship into little pieces with 
<A NAME="304"></A>a bolt of white lightning as soon as they get out to 
<A NAME="305"></A>sea.'
<A NAME="306"></A><BR><BR>"I was told all this by Calypso, who said she had heard it from 
<A NAME="307"></A>the mouth of Mercury.
<A NAME="308"></A><BR><BR>"As soon as I got down to my ship and to the sea shore I rebuked 
<A NAME="309"></A>each one of the men separately, but we could see no way out of it, for 
<A NAME="310"></A>the cows were dead already. And indeed the gods began at once to show signs 
<A NAME="311"></A>and wonders among us, for the hides of the cattle crawled about, and the 
<A NAME="312"></A>joints upon the spits began to low like cows, and the meat, whether cooked 
<A NAME="313"></A>or raw, kept on making a noise just as cows do.
<A NAME="314"></A><BR><BR>"For six days my men kept driving in the best cows and feasting 
<A NAME="315"></A>upon them, but when Jove the son of Saturn had added a seventh day, the 
<A NAME="316"></A>fury of the gale abated; we therefore went on board, raised our masts, 
<A NAME="317"></A>spread sail, and put out to sea. As soon as we were well away from the 
<A NAME="318"></A>island, and could see nothing but sky and sea, the son of Saturn raised 
<A NAME="319"></A>a black cloud over our ship, and the sea grew dark beneath it. We not get 
<A NAME="320"></A>on much further, for in another moment we were caught by a terrific squall 
<A NAME="321"></A>from the West that snapped the forestays of the mast so that it fell aft, 
<A NAME="322"></A>while all the ship's gear tumbled about at the bottom of the vessel. The 
<A NAME="323"></A>mast fell upon the head of the helmsman in the ship's stern, so that the 
<A NAME="324"></A>bones of his head were crushed to pieces, and he fell overboard as though 
<A NAME="325"></A>he were diving, with no more life left in him.
<A NAME="326"></A><BR><BR>"Then Jove let fly with his thunderbolts, and the ship went round 
<A NAME="327"></A>and round, and was filled with fire and brimstone as the lightning struck 
<A NAME="328"></A>it. The men all fell into the sea; they were carried about in the water 
<A NAME="329"></A>round the ship, looking like so many sea-gulls, but the god presently deprived 
<A NAME="330"></A>them of all chance of getting home again.
<A NAME="331"></A><BR><BR>"I stuck to the ship till the sea knocked her sides from her keel 
<A NAME="332"></A>(which drifted about by itself) and struck the mast out of her in the direction 
<A NAME="333"></A>of the keel; but there was a backstay of stout ox-thong still hanging about 
<A NAME="334"></A>it, and with this I lashed the mast and keel together, and getting astride 
<A NAME="335"></A>of them was carried wherever the winds chose to take 
<A NAME="336"></A>me.
<A NAME="337"></A><BR><BR>"[The gale from the West had now spent its force, and the wind 
<A NAME="338"></A>got into the South again, which frightened me lest I should be taken back 
<A NAME="339"></A>to the terrible whirlpool of Charybdis. This indeed was what actually happened, 
<A NAME="340"></A>for I was borne along by the waves all night, and by sunrise had reacfied 
<A NAME="341"></A>the rock of Scylla, and the whirlpool. She was then sucking down the salt 
<A NAME="342"></A>sea water, but I was carried aloft toward the fig tree, which I caught 
<A NAME="343"></A>hold of and clung on to like a bat. I could not plant my feet anywhere 
<A NAME="344"></A>so as to stand securely, for the roots were a long way off and the boughs 
<A NAME="345"></A>that overshadowed the whole pool were too high, too vast, and too far apart 
<A NAME="346"></A>for me to reach them; so I hung patiently on, waiting till the pool should 
<A NAME="347"></A>discharge my mast and raft again- and a very long while it seemed. A juryman 
<A NAME="348"></A>is not more glad to get home to supper, after having been long detained 
<A NAME="349"></A>in court by troublesome cases, than I was to see my raft beginning to work 
<A NAME="350"></A>its way out of the whirlpool again. At last I let go with my hands and 
<A NAME="351"></A>feet, and fell heavily into the sea, bard by my raft on to which I then 
<A NAME="352"></A>got, and began to row with my hands. As for Scylla, the father of gods 
<A NAME="353"></A>and men would not let her get further sight of me- otherwise I should have 
<A NAME="354"></A>certainly been lost.]
<A NAME="355"></A><BR><BR>"Hence I was carried along for nine days till on the tenth night 
<A NAME="356"></A>the gods stranded me on the Ogygian island, where dwells the great and 
<A NAME="357"></A>powerful goddess Calypso. She took me in and was kind to me, but I need 
<A NAME="358"></A>say no more about this, for I told you and your noble wife all about it 
<A NAME="359"></A>yesterday, and I hate saying the same thing over and over 
<A NAME="360"></A>again."
