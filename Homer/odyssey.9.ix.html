<A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A>And Ulysses answered, "King Alcinous, it is a good thing to hear a bard 
<A NAME="11"></A>with such a divine voice as this man has. There is nothing better or more 
<A NAME="12"></A>delightful than when a whole people make merry together, with the guests 
<A NAME="13"></A>sitting orderly to listen, while the table is loaded with bread and meats, 
<A NAME="14"></A>and the cup-bearer draws wine and fills his cup for every man. This is 
<A NAME="15"></A>indeed as fair a sight as a man can see. Now, however, since you are inclined 
<A NAME="16"></A>to ask the story of my sorrows, and rekindle my own sad memories in respect 
<A NAME="17"></A>of them, I do not know how to begin, nor yet how to continue and conclude 
<A NAME="18"></A>my tale, for the hand of heaven has been laid heavily upon 
<A NAME="19"></A>me.
<A NAME="20"></A><BR><BR>"Firstly, then, I will tell you my name that you too may know it, 
<A NAME="21"></A>and one day, if I outlive this time of sorrow, may become my there guests 
<A NAME="22"></A>though I live so far away from all of you. I am Ulysses son of Laertes, 
<A NAME="23"></A>reknowned among mankind for all manner of subtlety, so that my fame ascends 
<A NAME="24"></A>to heaven. I live in Ithaca, where there is a high mountain called Neritum, 
<A NAME="25"></A>covered with forests; and not far from it there is a group of islands very 
<A NAME="26"></A>near to one another- Dulichium, Same, and the wooded island of Zacynthus. 
<A NAME="27"></A>It lies squat on the horizon, all highest up in the sea towards the sunset, 
<A NAME="28"></A>while the others lie away from it towards dawn. It is a rugged island, 
<A NAME="29"></A>but it breeds brave men, and my eyes know none that they better love to 
<A NAME="30"></A>look upon. The goddess Calypso kept me with her in her cave, and wanted 
<A NAME="31"></A>me to marry her, as did also the cunning Aeaean goddess Circe; but they 
<A NAME="32"></A>could neither of them persuade me, for there is nothing dearer to a man 
<A NAME="33"></A>than his own country and his parents, and however splendid a home he may 
<A NAME="34"></A>have in a foreign country, if it be far from father or mother, he does 
<A NAME="35"></A>not care about it. Now, however, I will tell you of the many hazardous 
<A NAME="36"></A>adventures which by Jove's will I met with on my return from 
<A NAME="37"></A>Troy.
<A NAME="38"></A><BR><BR>"When I had set sail thence the wind took me first to Ismarus, 
<A NAME="39"></A>which is the city of the Cicons. There I sacked the town and put the people 
<A NAME="40"></A>to the sword. We took their wives and also much booty, which we divided 
<A NAME="41"></A>equitably amongst us, so that none might have reason to complain. I then 
<A NAME="42"></A>said that we had better make off at once, but my men very foolishly would 
<A NAME="43"></A>not obey me, so they stayed there drinking much wine and killing great 
<A NAME="44"></A>numbers of sheep and oxen on the sea shore. Meanwhile the Cicons cried 
<A NAME="45"></A>out for help to other Cicons who lived inland. These were more in number, 
<A NAME="46"></A>and stronger, and they were more skilled in the art of war, for they could 
<A NAME="47"></A>fight, either from chariots or on foot as the occasion served; in the morning, 
<A NAME="48"></A>therefore, they came as thick as leaves and bloom in summer, and the hand 
<A NAME="49"></A>of heaven was against us, so that we were hard pressed. They set the battle 
<A NAME="50"></A>in array near the ships, and the hosts aimed their bronze-shod spears at 
<A NAME="51"></A>one another. So long as the day waxed and it was still morning, we held 
<A NAME="52"></A>our own against them, though they were more in number than we; but as the 
<A NAME="53"></A>sun went down, towards the time when men loose their oxen, the Cicons got 
<A NAME="54"></A>the better of us, and we lost half a dozen men from every ship we had; 
<A NAME="55"></A>so we got away with those that were left.
<A NAME="56"></A><BR><BR>"Thence we sailed onward with sorrow in our hearts, but glad to 
<A NAME="57"></A>have escaped death though we had lost our comrades, nor did we leave till 
<A NAME="58"></A>we had thrice invoked each one of the poor fellows who had perished by 
<A NAME="59"></A>the hands of the Cicons. Then Jove raised the North wind against us till 
<A NAME="60"></A>it blew a hurricane, so that land and sky were hidden in thick clouds, 
<A NAME="61"></A>and night sprang forth out of the heavens. We let the ships run before 
<A NAME="62"></A>the gale, but the force of the wind tore our sails to tatters, so we took 
<A NAME="63"></A>them down for fear of shipwreck, and rowed our hardest towards the land. 
<A NAME="64"></A>There we lay two days and two nights suffering much alike from toil and 
<A NAME="65"></A>distress of mind, but on the morning of the third day we again raised our 
<A NAME="66"></A>masts, set sail, and took our places, letting the wind and steersmen direct 
<A NAME="67"></A>our ship. I should have got home at that time unharmed had not the North 
<A NAME="68"></A>wind and the currents been against me as I was doubling Cape Malea, and 
<A NAME="69"></A>set me off my course hard by the island of Cythera.
<A NAME="70"></A><BR><BR>"I was driven thence by foul winds for a space of nine days upon 
<A NAME="71"></A>the sea, but on the tenth day we reached the land of the Lotus-eater, who 
<A NAME="72"></A>live on a food that comes from a kind of flower. Here we landed to take 
<A NAME="73"></A>in fresh water, and our crews got their mid-day meal on the shore near 
<A NAME="74"></A>the ships. When they had eaten and drunk I sent two of my company to see 
<A NAME="75"></A>what manner of men the people of the place might be, and they had a third 
<A NAME="76"></A>man under them. They started at once, and went about among the Lotus-eaters, 
<A NAME="77"></A>who did them no hurt, but gave them to eat of the lotus, which was so delicious 
<A NAME="78"></A>that those who ate of it left off caring about home, and did not even want 
<A NAME="79"></A>to go back and say what had happened to them, but were for staying and 
<A NAME="80"></A>munching lotus with the Lotus-eater without thinking further of their return; 
<A NAME="81"></A>nevertheless, though they wept bitterly I forced them back to the ships 
<A NAME="82"></A>and made them fast under the benches. Then I told the rest to go on board 
<A NAME="83"></A>at once, lest any of them should taste of the lotus and leave off wanting 
<A NAME="84"></A>to get home, so they took their places and smote the grey sea with their 
<A NAME="85"></A>oars.
<A NAME="86"></A><BR><BR>"We sailed hence, always in much distress, till we came to the 
<A NAME="87"></A>land of the lawless and inhuman Cyclopes. Now the Cyclopes neither plant 
<A NAME="88"></A>nor plough, but trust in providence, and live on such wheat, barley, and 
<A NAME="89"></A>grapes as grow wild without any kind of tillage, and their wild grapes 
<A NAME="90"></A>yield them wine as the sun and the rain may grow them. They have no laws 
<A NAME="91"></A>nor assemblies of the people, but live in caves on the tops of high mountains; 
<A NAME="92"></A>each is lord and master in his family, and they take no account of their 
<A NAME="93"></A>neighbours.
<A NAME="94"></A><BR><BR>"Now off their harbour there lies a wooded and fertile island not 
<A NAME="95"></A>quite close to the land of the Cyclopes, but still not far. It is overrun 
<A NAME="96"></A>with wild goats, that breed there in great numbers and are never disturbed 
<A NAME="97"></A>by foot of man; for sportsmen- who as a rule will suffer so much hardship 
<A NAME="98"></A>in forest or among mountain precipices- do not go there, nor yet again 
<A NAME="99"></A>is it ever ploughed or fed down, but it lies a wilderness untilled and 
<A NAME="100"></A>unsown from year to year, and has no living thing upon it but only goats. 
<A NAME="101"></A>For the Cyclopes have no ships, nor yet shipwrights who could make ships 
<A NAME="102"></A>for them; they cannot therefore go from city to city, or sail over the 
<A NAME="103"></A>sea to one another's country as people who have ships can do; if they had 
<A NAME="104"></A>had these they would have colonized the island, for it is a very good one, 
<A NAME="105"></A>and would yield everything in due season. There are meadows that in some 
<A NAME="106"></A>places come right down to the sea shore, well watered and full of luscious 
<A NAME="107"></A>grass; grapes would do there excellently; there is level land for ploughing, 
<A NAME="108"></A>and it would always yield heavily at harvest time, for the soil is deep. 
<A NAME="109"></A>There is a good harbour where no cables are wanted, nor yet anchors, nor 
<A NAME="110"></A>need a ship be moored, but all one has to do is to beach one's vessel and 
<A NAME="111"></A>stay there till the wind becomes fair for putting out to sea again. At 
<A NAME="112"></A>the head of the harbour there is a spring of clear water coming out of 
<A NAME="113"></A>a cave, and there are poplars growing all round it.
<A NAME="114"></A><BR><BR>"Here we entered, but so dark was the night that some god must 
<A NAME="115"></A>have brought us in, for there was nothing whatever to be seen. A thick 
<A NAME="116"></A>mist hung all round our ships; the moon was hidden behind a mass of clouds 
<A NAME="117"></A>so that no one could have seen the island if he had looked for it, nor 
<A NAME="118"></A>were there any breakers to tell us we were close in shore before we found 
<A NAME="119"></A>ourselves upon the land itself; when, however, we had beached the ships, 
<A NAME="120"></A>we took down the sails, went ashore and camped upon the beach till 
<A NAME="121"></A>daybreak.
<A NAME="122"></A><BR><BR>"When the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, we admired 
<A NAME="123"></A>the island and wandered all over it, while the nymphs Jove's daughters 
<A NAME="124"></A>roused the wild goats that we might get some meat for our dinner. On this 
<A NAME="125"></A>we fetched our spears and bows and arrows from the ships, and dividing 
<A NAME="126"></A>ourselves into three bands began to shoot the goats. Heaven sent us excellent 
<A NAME="127"></A>sport; I had twelve ships with me, and each ship got nine goats, while 
<A NAME="128"></A>my own ship had ten; thus through the livelong day to the going down of 
<A NAME="129"></A>the sun we ate and drank our fill,- and we had plenty of wine left, for 
<A NAME="130"></A>each one of us had taken many jars full when we sacked the city of the 
<A NAME="131"></A>Cicons, and this had not yet run out. While we were feasting we kept turning 
<A NAME="132"></A>our eyes towards the land of the Cyclopes, which was hard by, and saw the 
<A NAME="133"></A>smoke of their stubble fires. We could almost fancy we heard their voices 
<A NAME="134"></A>and the bleating of their sheep and goats, but when the sun went down and 
<A NAME="135"></A>it came on dark, we camped down upon the beach, and next morning I called 
<A NAME="136"></A>a council.
<A NAME="137"></A><BR><BR>"'Stay here, my brave fellows,' said I, 'all the rest of you, while 
<A NAME="138"></A>I go with my ship and exploit these people myself: I want to see if they 
<A NAME="139"></A>are uncivilized savages, or a hospitable and humane 
<A NAME="140"></A>race.'
<A NAME="141"></A><BR><BR>"I went on board, bidding my men to do so also and loose the hawsers; 
<A NAME="142"></A>so they took their places and smote the grey sea with their oars. When 
<A NAME="143"></A>we got to the land, which was not far, there, on the face of a cliff near 
<A NAME="144"></A>the sea, we saw a great cave overhung with laurels. It was a station for 
<A NAME="145"></A>a great many sheep and goats, and outside there was a large yard, with 
<A NAME="146"></A>a high wall round it made of stones built into the ground and of trees 
<A NAME="147"></A>both pine and oak. This was the abode of a huge monster who was then away 
<A NAME="148"></A>from home shepherding his flocks. He would have nothing to do with other 
<A NAME="149"></A>people, but led the life of an outlaw. He was a horrid creature, not like 
<A NAME="150"></A>a human being at all, but resembling rather some crag that stands out boldly 
<A NAME="151"></A>against the sky on the top of a high mountain.
<A NAME="152"></A><BR><BR>"I told my men to draw the ship ashore, and stay where they were, 
<A NAME="153"></A>all but the twelve best among them, who were to go along with myself. I 
<A NAME="154"></A>also took a goatskin of sweet black wine which had been given me by Maron, 
<A NAME="155"></A>Apollo son of Euanthes, who was priest of Apollo the patron god of Ismarus, 
<A NAME="156"></A>and lived within the wooded precincts of the temple. When we were sacking 
<A NAME="157"></A>the city we respected him, and spared his life, as also his wife and child; 
<A NAME="158"></A>so he made me some presents of great value- seven talents of fine gold, 
<A NAME="159"></A>and a bowl of silver, with twelve jars of sweet wine, unblended, and of 
<A NAME="160"></A>the most exquisite flavour. Not a man nor maid in the house knew about 
<A NAME="161"></A>it, but only himself, his wife, and one housekeeper: when he drank it he 
<A NAME="162"></A>mixed twenty parts of water to one of wine, and yet the fragrance from 
<A NAME="163"></A>the mixing-bowl was so exquisite that it was impossible to refrain from 
<A NAME="164"></A>drinking. I filled a large skin with this wine, and took a wallet full 
<A NAME="165"></A>of provisions with me, for my mind misgave me that I might have to deal 
<A NAME="166"></A>with some savage who would be of great strength, and would respect neither 
<A NAME="167"></A>right nor law.
<A NAME="168"></A><BR><BR>"We soon reached his cave, but he was out shepherding, so we went 
<A NAME="169"></A>inside and took stock of all that we could see. His cheese-racks were loaded 
<A NAME="170"></A>with cheeses, and he had more lambs and kids than his pens could hold. 
<A NAME="171"></A>They were kept in separate flocks; first there were the hoggets, then the 
<A NAME="172"></A>oldest of the younger lambs and lastly the very young ones all kept apart 
<A NAME="173"></A>from one another; as for his dairy, all the vessels, bowls, and milk pails 
<A NAME="174"></A>into which he milked, were swimming with whey. When they saw all this, 
<A NAME="175"></A>my men begged me to let them first steal some cheeses, and make off with 
<A NAME="176"></A>them to the ship; they would then return, drive down the lambs and kids, 
<A NAME="177"></A>put them on board and sail away with them. It would have been indeed better 
<A NAME="178"></A>if we had done so but I would not listen to them, for I wanted to see the 
<A NAME="179"></A>owner himself, in the hope that he might give me a present. When, however, 
<A NAME="180"></A>we saw him my poor men found him ill to deal with.
<A NAME="181"></A><BR><BR>"We lit a fire, offered some of the cheeses in sacrifice, ate others 
<A NAME="182"></A>of them, and then sat waiting till the Cyclops should come in with his 
<A NAME="183"></A>sheep. When he came, he brought in with him a huge load of dry firewood 
<A NAME="184"></A>to light the fire for his supper, and this he flung with such a noise on 
<A NAME="185"></A>to the floor of his cave that we hid ourselves for fear at the far end 
<A NAME="186"></A>of the cavern. Meanwhile he drove all the ewes inside, as well as the she-goats 
<A NAME="187"></A>that he was going to milk, leaving the males, both rams and he-goats, outside 
<A NAME="188"></A>in the yards. Then he rolled a huge stone to the mouth of the cave- so 
<A NAME="189"></A>huge that two and twenty strong four-wheeled waggons would not be enough 
<A NAME="190"></A>to draw it from its place against the doorway. When he had so done he sat 
<A NAME="191"></A>down and milked his ewes and goats, all in due course, and then let each 
<A NAME="192"></A>of them have her own young. He curdled half the milk and set it aside in 
<A NAME="193"></A>wicker strainers, but the other half he poured into bowls that he might 
<A NAME="194"></A>drink it for his supper. When he had got through with all his work, he 
<A NAME="195"></A>lit the fire, and then caught sight of us, whereon he 
<A NAME="196"></A>said:
<A NAME="197"></A><BR><BR>"'Strangers, who are you? Where do sail from? Are you traders, 
<A NAME="198"></A>or do you sail the as rovers, with your hands against every man, and every 
<A NAME="199"></A>man's hand against you?'
<A NAME="200"></A><BR><BR>"We were frightened out of our senses by his loud voice and monstrous 
<A NAME="201"></A>form, but I managed to say, 'We are Achaeans on our way home from Troy, 
<A NAME="202"></A>but by the will of Jove, and stress of weather, we have been driven far 
<A NAME="203"></A>out of our course. We are the people of Agamemnon, son of Atreus, who has 
<A NAME="204"></A>won infinite renown throughout the whole world, by sacking so great a city 
<A NAME="205"></A>and killing so many people. We therefore humbly pray you to show us some 
<A NAME="206"></A>hospitality, and otherwise make us such presents as visitors may reasonably 
<A NAME="207"></A>expect. May your excellency fear the wrath of heaven, for we are your suppliants, 
<A NAME="208"></A>and Jove takes all respectable travellers under his protection, for he 
<A NAME="209"></A>is the avenger of all suppliants and foreigners in distress.'
<A NAME="210"></A><BR><BR>"To this he gave me but a pitiless answer, 'Stranger,' said he, 
<A NAME="211"></A>'you are a fool, or else you know nothing of this country. Talk to me, 
<A NAME="212"></A>indeed, about fearing the gods or shunning their anger? We Cyclopes do 
<A NAME="213"></A>not care about Jove or any of your blessed gods, for we are ever so much 
<A NAME="214"></A>stronger than they. I shall not spare either yourself or your companions 
<A NAME="215"></A>out of any regard for Jove, unless I am in the humour for doing so. And 
<A NAME="216"></A>now tell me where you made your ship fast when you came on shore. Was it 
<A NAME="217"></A>round the point, or is she lying straight off the land?'
<A NAME="218"></A><BR><BR>"He said this to draw me out, but I was too cunning to be caught 
<A NAME="219"></A>in that way, so I answered with a lie; 'Neptune,' said I, 'sent my ship 
<A NAME="220"></A>on to the rocks at the far end of your country, and wrecked it. We were 
<A NAME="221"></A>driven on to them from the open sea, but I and those who are with me escaped 
<A NAME="222"></A>the jaws of death.'
<A NAME="223"></A><BR><BR>"The cruel wretch vouchsafed me not one word of answer, but with 
<A NAME="224"></A>a sudden clutch he gripped up two of my men at once and dashed them down 
<A NAME="225"></A>upon the ground as though they had been puppies. Their brains were shed 
<A NAME="226"></A>upon the ground, and the earth was wet with their blood. Then he tore them 
<A NAME="227"></A>limb from limb and supped upon them. He gobbled them up like a lion in 
<A NAME="228"></A>the wilderness, flesh, bones, marrow, and entrails, without leaving anything 
<A NAME="229"></A>uneaten. As for us, we wept and lifted up our hands to heaven on seeing 
<A NAME="230"></A>such a horrid sight, for we did not know what else to do; but when the 
<A NAME="231"></A>Cyclops had filled his huge paunch, and had washed down his meal of human 
<A NAME="232"></A>flesh with a drink of neat milk, he stretched himself full length upon 
<A NAME="233"></A>the ground among his sheep, and went to sleep. I was at first inclined 
<A NAME="234"></A>to seize my sword, draw it, and drive it into his vitals, but I reflected 
<A NAME="235"></A>that if I did we should all certainly be lost, for we should never be able 
<A NAME="236"></A>to shift the stone which the monster had put in front of the door. So we 
<A NAME="237"></A>stayed sobbing and sighing where we were till morning 
<A NAME="238"></A>came.
<A NAME="239"></A><BR><BR>"When the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, he again 
<A NAME="240"></A>lit his fire, milked his goats and ewes, all quite rightly, and then let 
<A NAME="241"></A>each have her own young one; as soon as he had got through with all his 
<A NAME="242"></A>work, he clutched up two more of my men, and began eating them for his 
<A NAME="243"></A>morning's meal. Presently, with the utmost ease, he rolled the stone away 
<A NAME="244"></A>from the door and drove out his sheep, but he at once put it back again- 
<A NAME="245"></A>as easily as though he were merely clapping the lid on to a quiver full 
<A NAME="246"></A>of arrows. As soon as he had done so he shouted, and cried 'Shoo, shoo,' 
<A NAME="247"></A>after his sheep to drive them on to the mountain; so I was left to scheme 
<A NAME="248"></A>some way of taking my revenge and covering myself with 
<A NAME="249"></A>glory.
<A NAME="250"></A><BR><BR>"In the end I deemed it would be the best plan to do as follows. 
<A NAME="251"></A>The Cyclops had a great club which was lying near one of the sheep pens; 
<A NAME="252"></A>it was of green olive wood, and he had cut it intending to use it for a 
<A NAME="253"></A>staff as soon as it should be dry. It was so huge that we could only compare 
<A NAME="254"></A>it to the mast of a twenty-oared merchant vessel of large burden, and able 
<A NAME="255"></A>to venture out into open sea. I went up to this club and cut off about 
<A NAME="256"></A>six feet of it; I then gave this piece to the men and told them to fine 
<A NAME="257"></A>it evenly off at one end, which they proceeded to do, and lastly I brought 
<A NAME="258"></A>it to a point myself, charring the end in the fire to make it harder. When 
<A NAME="259"></A>I had done this I hid it under dung, which was lying about all over the 
<A NAME="260"></A>cave, and told the men to cast lots which of them should venture along 
<A NAME="261"></A>with myself to lift it and bore it into the monster's eye while he was 
<A NAME="262"></A>asleep. The lot fell upon the very four whom I should have chosen, and 
<A NAME="263"></A>I myself made five. In the evening the wretch came back from shepherding, 
<A NAME="264"></A>and drove his flocks into the cave- this time driving them all inside, 
<A NAME="265"></A>and not leaving any in the yards; I suppose some fancy must have taken 
<A NAME="266"></A>him, or a god must have prompted him to do so. As soon as he had put the 
<A NAME="267"></A>stone back to its place against the door, he sat down, milked his ewes 
<A NAME="268"></A>and his goats all quite rightly, and then let each have her own young one; 
<A NAME="269"></A>when he had got through with all this work, he gripped up two more of my 
<A NAME="270"></A>men, and made his supper off them. So I went up to him with an ivy-wood 
<A NAME="271"></A>bowl of black wine in my hands:
<A NAME="272"></A><BR><BR>"'Look here, Cyclops,' said I, you have been eating a great deal 
<A NAME="273"></A>of man's flesh, so take this and drink some wine, that you may see what 
<A NAME="274"></A>kind of liquor we had on board my ship. I was bringing it to you as a drink-offering, 
<A NAME="275"></A>in the hope that you would take compassion upon me and further me on my 
<A NAME="276"></A>way home, whereas all you do is to go on ramping and raving most intolerably. 
<A NAME="277"></A>You ought to be ashamed yourself; how can you expect people to come see 
<A NAME="278"></A>you any more if you treat them in this way?'
<A NAME="279"></A><BR><BR>"He then took the cup and drank. He was so delighted with the taste 
<A NAME="280"></A>of the wine that he begged me for another bowl full. 'Be so kind,' he said, 
<A NAME="281"></A>'as to give me some more, and tell me your name at once. I want to make 
<A NAME="282"></A>you a present that you will be glad to have. We have wine even in this 
<A NAME="283"></A>country, for our soil grows grapes and the sun ripens them, but this drinks 
<A NAME="284"></A>like nectar and ambrosia all in one.'
<A NAME="285"></A><BR><BR>"I then gave him some more; three times did I fill the bowl for 
<A NAME="286"></A>him, and three times did he drain it without thought or heed; then, when 
<A NAME="287"></A>I saw that the wine had got into his head, I said to him as plausibly as 
<A NAME="288"></A>I could: 'Cyclops, you ask my name and I will tell it you; give me, therefore, 
<A NAME="289"></A>the present you promised me; my name is Noman; this is what my father and 
<A NAME="290"></A>mother and my friends have always called me.'
<A NAME="291"></A><BR><BR>"But the cruel wretch said, 'Then I will eat all Noman's comrades 
<A NAME="292"></A>before Noman himself, and will keep Noman for the last. This is the present 
<A NAME="293"></A>that I will make him.'
<A NAME="294"></A><BR><BR>As he spoke he reeled, and fell sprawling face upwards on the ground. 
<A NAME="295"></A>His great neck hung heavily backwards and a deep sleep took hold upon him. 
<A NAME="296"></A>Presently he turned sick, and threw up both wine and the gobbets of human 
<A NAME="297"></A>flesh on which he had been gorging, for he was very drunk. Then I thrust 
<A NAME="298"></A>the beam of wood far into the embers to heat it, and encouraged my men 
<A NAME="299"></A>lest any of them should turn faint-hearted. When the wood, green though 
<A NAME="300"></A>it was, was about to blaze, I drew it out of the fire glowing with heat, 
<A NAME="301"></A>and my men gathered round me, for heaven had filled their hearts with courage. 
<A NAME="302"></A>We drove the sharp end of the beam into the monster's eye, and bearing 
<A NAME="303"></A>upon it with all my weight I kept turning it round and round as though 
<A NAME="304"></A>I were boring a hole in a ship's plank with an auger, which two men with 
<A NAME="305"></A>a wheel and strap can keep on turning as long as they choose. Even thus 
<A NAME="306"></A>did we bore the red hot beam into his eye, till the boiling blood bubbled 
<A NAME="307"></A>all over it as we worked it round and round, so that the steam from the 
<A NAME="308"></A>burning eyeball scalded his eyelids and eyebrows, and the roots of the 
<A NAME="309"></A>eye sputtered in the fire. As a blacksmith plunges an axe or hatchet into 
<A NAME="310"></A>cold water to temper it- for it is this that gives strength to the iron- 
<A NAME="311"></A>and it makes a great hiss as he does so, even thus did the Cyclops' eye 
<A NAME="312"></A>hiss round the beam of olive wood, and his hideous yells made the cave 
<A NAME="313"></A>ring again. We ran away in a fright, but he plucked the beam all besmirched 
<A NAME="314"></A>with gore from his eye, and hurled it from him in a frenzy of rage and 
<A NAME="315"></A>pain, shouting as he did so to the other Cyclopes who lived on the bleak 
<A NAME="316"></A>headlands near him; so they gathered from all quarters round his cave when 
<A NAME="317"></A>they heard him crying, and asked what was the matter with 
<A NAME="318"></A>him.
<A NAME="319"></A><BR><BR>"'What ails you, Polyphemus,' said they, 'that you make such a 
<A NAME="320"></A>noise, breaking the stillness of the night, and preventing us from being 
<A NAME="321"></A>able to sleep? Surely no man is carrying off your sheep? Surely no man 
<A NAME="322"></A>is trying to kill you either by fraud or by force?
<A NAME="323"></A><BR><BR>"But Polyphemus shouted to them from inside the cave, 'Noman is 
<A NAME="324"></A>killing me by fraud! Noman is killing me by force!'
<A NAME="325"></A><BR><BR>"'Then,' said they, 'if no man is attacking you, you must be ill; 
<A NAME="326"></A>when Jove makes people ill, there is no help for it, and you had better 
<A NAME="327"></A>pray to your father Neptune.'
<A NAME="328"></A><BR><BR>"Then they went away, and I laughed inwardly at the success of 
<A NAME="329"></A>my clever stratagem, but the Cyclops, groaning and in an agony of pain, 
<A NAME="330"></A>felt about with his hands till he found the stone and took it from the 
<A NAME="331"></A>door; then he sat in the doorway and stretched his hands in front of it 
<A NAME="332"></A>to catch anyone going out with the sheep, for he thought I might be foolish 
<A NAME="333"></A>enough to attempt this.
<A NAME="334"></A><BR><BR>"As for myself I kept on puzzling to think how I could best save 
<A NAME="335"></A>my own life and those of my companions; I schemed and schemed, as one who 
<A NAME="336"></A>knows that his life depends upon it, for the danger was very great. In 
<A NAME="337"></A>the end I deemed that this plan would be the best. The male sheep were 
<A NAME="338"></A>well grown, and carried a heavy black fleece, so I bound them noiselessly 
<A NAME="339"></A>in threes together, with some of the withies on which the wicked monster 
<A NAME="340"></A>used to sleep. There was to be a man under the middle sheep, and the two 
<A NAME="341"></A>on either side were to cover him, so that there were three sheep to each 
<A NAME="342"></A>man. As for myself there was a ram finer than any of the others, so I caught 
<A NAME="343"></A>hold of him by the back, esconced myself in the thick wool under his belly, 
<A NAME="344"></A>and flung on patiently to his fleece, face upwards, keeping a firm hold 
<A NAME="345"></A>on it all the time.
<A NAME="346"></A><BR><BR>"Thus, then, did we wait in great fear of mind till morning came, 
<A NAME="347"></A>but when the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, the male sheep 
<A NAME="348"></A>hurried out to feed, while the ewes remained bleating about the pens waiting 
<A NAME="349"></A>to be milked, for their udders were full to bursting; but their master 
<A NAME="350"></A>in spite of all his pain felt the backs of all the sheep as they stood 
<A NAME="351"></A>upright, without being sharp enough to find out that the men were underneath 
<A NAME="352"></A>their bellies. As the ram was going out, last of all, heavy with its fleece 
<A NAME="353"></A>and with the weight of my crafty self; Polyphemus laid hold of it and 
<A NAME="354"></A>said:
<A NAME="355"></A><BR><BR>"'My good ram, what is it that makes you the last to leave my cave 
<A NAME="356"></A>this morning? You are not wont to let the ewes go before you, but lead 
<A NAME="357"></A>the mob with a run whether to flowery mead or bubbling fountain, and are 
<A NAME="358"></A>the first to come home again at night; but now you lag last of all. Is 
<A NAME="359"></A>it because you know your master has lost his eye, and are sorry because 
<A NAME="360"></A>that wicked Noman and his horrid crew have got him down in his drink and 
<A NAME="361"></A>blinded him? But I will have his life yet. If you could understand and 
<A NAME="362"></A>talk, you would tell me where the wretch is hiding, and I would dash his 
<A NAME="363"></A>brains upon the ground till they flew all over the cave. I should thus 
<A NAME="364"></A>have some satisfaction for the harm a this no-good Noman has done 
<A NAME="365"></A>me.'
<A NAME="366"></A><BR><BR>"As spoke he drove the ram outside, but when we were a little way 
<A NAME="367"></A>out from the cave and yards, I first got from under the ram's belly, and 
<A NAME="368"></A>then freed my comrades; as for the sheep, which were very fat, by constantly 
<A NAME="369"></A>heading them in the right direction we managed to drive them down to the 
<A NAME="370"></A>ship. The crew rejoiced greatly at seeing those of us who had escaped death, 
<A NAME="371"></A>but wept for the others whom the Cyclops had killed. However, I made signs 
<A NAME="372"></A>to them by nodding and frowning that they were to hush their crying, and 
<A NAME="373"></A>told them to get all the sheep on board at once and put out to sea; so 
<A NAME="374"></A>they went aboard, took their places, and smote the grey sea with their 
<A NAME="375"></A>oars. Then, when I had got as far out as my voice would reach, I began 
<A NAME="376"></A>to jeer at the Cyclops.
<A NAME="377"></A><BR><BR>"'Cyclops,' said I, 'you should have taken better measure of your 
<A NAME="378"></A>man before eating up his comrades in your cave. You wretch, eat up your 
<A NAME="379"></A>visitors in your own house? You might have known that your sin would find 
<A NAME="380"></A>you out, and now Jove and the other gods have punished 
<A NAME="381"></A>you.'
<A NAME="382"></A><BR><BR>"He got more and more furious as he heard me, so he tore the top 
<A NAME="383"></A>from off a high mountain, and flung it just in front of my ship so that 
<A NAME="384"></A>it was within a little of hitting the end of the rudder. The sea quaked 
<A NAME="385"></A>as the rock fell into it, and the wash of the wave it raised carried us 
<A NAME="386"></A>back towards the mainland, and forced us towards the shore. But I snatched 
<A NAME="387"></A>up a long pole and kept the ship off, making signs to my men by nodding 
<A NAME="388"></A>my head, that they must row for their lives, whereon they laid out with 
<A NAME="389"></A>a will. When we had got twice as far as we were before, I was for jeering 
<A NAME="390"></A>at the Cyclops again, but the men begged and prayed of me to hold my 
<A NAME="391"></A>tongue.
<A NAME="392"></A><BR><BR>"'Do not,' they exclaimed, 'be mad enough to provoke this savage 
<A NAME="393"></A>creature further; he has thrown one rock at us already which drove us back 
<A NAME="394"></A>again to the mainland, and we made sure it had been the death of us; if 
<A NAME="395"></A>he had then heard any further sound of voices he would have pounded our 
<A NAME="396"></A>heads and our ship's timbers into a jelly with the rugged rocks he would 
<A NAME="397"></A>have heaved at us, for he can throw them a long way.'
<A NAME="398"></A><BR><BR>"But I would not listen to them, and shouted out to him in my rage, 
<A NAME="399"></A>'Cyclops, if any one asks you who it was that put your eye out and spoiled 
<A NAME="400"></A>your beauty, say it was the valiant warrior Ulysses, son of Laertes, who 
<A NAME="401"></A>lives in Ithaca.'
<A NAME="402"></A><BR><BR>"On this he groaned, and cried out, 'Alas, alas, then the old prophecy 
<A NAME="403"></A>about me is coming true. There was a prophet here, at one time, a man both 
<A NAME="404"></A>brave and of great stature, Telemus son of Eurymus, who was an excellent 
<A NAME="405"></A>seer, and did all the prophesying for the Cyclopes till he grew old; he 
<A NAME="406"></A>told me that all this would happen to me some day, and said I should lose 
<A NAME="407"></A>my sight by the hand of Ulysses. I have been all along expecting some one 
<A NAME="408"></A>of imposing presence and superhuman strength, whereas he turns out to be 
<A NAME="409"></A>a little insignificant weakling, who has managed to blind my eye by taking 
<A NAME="410"></A>advantage of me in my drink; come here, then, Ulysses, that I may make 
<A NAME="411"></A>you presents to show my hospitality, and urge Neptune to help you forward 
<A NAME="412"></A>on your journey- for Neptune and I are father and son. He, if he so will, 
<A NAME="413"></A>shall heal me, which no one else neither god nor man can 
<A NAME="414"></A>do.'
<A NAME="415"></A><BR><BR>"Then I said, 'I wish I could be as sure of killing you outright 
<A NAME="416"></A>and sending you down to the house of Hades, as I am that it will take more 
<A NAME="417"></A>than Neptune to cure that eye of yours.'
<A NAME="418"></A><BR><BR>"On this he lifted up his hands to the firmament of heaven and 
<A NAME="419"></A>prayed, saying, 'Hear me, great Neptune; if I am indeed your own true-begotten 
<A NAME="420"></A>son, grant that Ulysses may never reach his home alive; or if he must get 
<A NAME="421"></A>back to his friends at last, let him do so late and in sore plight after 
<A NAME="422"></A>losing all his men [let him reach his home in another man's ship and find 
<A NAME="423"></A>trouble in his house.']
<A NAME="424"></A><BR><BR>"Thus did he pray, and Neptune heard his prayer. Then he picked 
<A NAME="425"></A>up a rock much larger than the first, swung it aloft and hurled it with 
<A NAME="426"></A>prodigious force. It fell just short of the ship, but was within a little 
<A NAME="427"></A>of hitting the end of the rudder. The sea quaked as the rock fell into 
<A NAME="428"></A>it, and the wash of the wave it raised drove us onwards on our way towards 
<A NAME="429"></A>the shore of the island.
<A NAME="430"></A><BR><BR>"When at last we got to the island where we had left the rest of 
<A NAME="431"></A>our ships, we found our comrades lamenting us, and anxiously awaiting our 
<A NAME="432"></A>return. We ran our vessel upon the sands and got out of her on to the sea 
<A NAME="433"></A>shore; we also landed the Cyclops' sheep, and divided them equitably amongst 
<A NAME="434"></A>us so that none might have reason to complain. As for the ram, my companions 
<A NAME="435"></A>agreed that I should have it as an extra share; so I sacrificed it on the 
<A NAME="436"></A>sea shore, and burned its thigh bones to Jove, who is the lord of all. 
<A NAME="437"></A>But he heeded not my sacrifice, and only thought how he might destroy my 
<A NAME="438"></A>ships and my comrades.
<A NAME="439"></A><BR><BR>"Thus through the livelong day to the going down of the sun we 
<A NAME="440"></A>feasted our fill on meat and drink, but when the sun went down and it came 
<A NAME="441"></A>on dark, we camped upon the beach. When the child of morning, rosy-fingered 
<A NAME="442"></A>Dawn, appeared, I bade my men on board and loose the hawsers. Then they 
<A NAME="443"></A>took their places and smote the grey sea with their oars; so we sailed 
<A NAME="444"></A>on with sorrow in our hearts, but glad to have escaped death though we 
<A NAME="445"></A>had lost our comrades.
