<A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A>Thus, then, did the Achaeans arm by their ships round you, O son of Peleus, 
<A NAME="11"></A>who were hungering for battle; while the Trojans over against them armed 
<A NAME="12"></A>upon the rise of the plain.
<A NAME="13"></A><BR><BR>Meanwhile Jove from the top of many-delled Olympus, bade Themis 
<A NAME="14"></A>gather the gods in council, whereon she went about and called them to the 
<A NAME="15"></A>house of Jove. There was not a river absent except Oceanus, nor a single 
<A NAME="16"></A>one of the nymphs that haunt fair groves, or springs of rivers and meadows 
<A NAME="17"></A>of green grass. When they reached the house of cloud-compelling Jove, they 
<A NAME="18"></A>took their seats in the arcades of polished marble which Vulcan with his 
<A NAME="19"></A>consummate skill had made for father Jove.
<A NAME="20"></A><BR><BR>In such wise, therefore, did they gather in the house of Jove. 
<A NAME="21"></A>Neptune also, lord of the earthquake, obeyed the call of the goddess, and 
<A NAME="22"></A>came up out of the sea to join them. There, sitting in the midst of them, 
<A NAME="23"></A>he asked what Jove's purpose might be. "Why," said he, "wielder of the 
<A NAME="24"></A>lightning, have you called the gods in council? Are you considering some 
<A NAME="25"></A>matter that concerns the Trojans and Achaeans- for the blaze of battle 
<A NAME="26"></A>is on the point of being kindled between them?"
<A NAME="27"></A><BR><BR>And Jove answered, "You know my purpose, shaker of earth, and wherefore 
<A NAME="28"></A>I have called you hither. I take thought for them even in their destruction. 
<A NAME="29"></A>For my own part I shall stay here seated on Mt. Olympus and look on in 
<A NAME="30"></A>peace, but do you others go about among Trojans and Achaeans, and help 
<A NAME="31"></A>either side as you may be severally disposed. If Achilles fights the Trojans 
<A NAME="32"></A>without hindrance they will make no stand against him; they have ever trembled 
<A NAME="33"></A>at the sight of him, and now that he is roused to such fury about his comrade, 
<A NAME="34"></A>he will override fate itself and storm their city."
<A NAME="35"></A><BR><BR>Thus spoke Jove and gave the word for war, whereon the gods took 
<A NAME="36"></A>their several sides and went into battle. Juno, Pallas Minerva, earth-encircling 
<A NAME="37"></A>Neptune, Mercury bringer of good luck and excellent in all cunning- all 
<A NAME="38"></A>these joined the host that came from the ships; with them also came Vulcan 
<A NAME="39"></A>in all his glory, limping, but yet with his thin legs plying lustily under 
<A NAME="40"></A>him. Mars of gleaming helmet joined the Trojans, and with him Apollo of 
<A NAME="41"></A>locks unshorn, and the archer goddess Diana, Leto, Xanthus, and laughter-loving 
<A NAME="42"></A>Venus.
<A NAME="43"></A><BR><BR>So long as the gods held themselves aloof from mortal warriors 
<A NAME="44"></A>the Achaeans were triumphant, for Achilles who had long refused to fight 
<A NAME="45"></A>was now with them. There was not a Trojan but his limbs failed him for 
<A NAME="46"></A>fear as he beheld the fleet son of Peleus all glorious in his armour, and 
<A NAME="47"></A>looking like Mars himself. When, however, the Olympians came to take their 
<A NAME="48"></A>part among men, forthwith uprose strong Strife, rouser of hosts, and Minerva 
<A NAME="49"></A>raised her loud voice, now standing by the deep trench that ran outside 
<A NAME="50"></A>the wall, and now shouting with all her might upon the shore of the sounding 
<A NAME="51"></A>sea. Mars also bellowed out upon the other side, dark as some black thunder-cloud, 
<A NAME="52"></A>and called on the Trojans at the top of his voice, now from the acropolis, 
<A NAME="53"></A>and now speeding up the side of the river Simois till he came to the hill 
<A NAME="54"></A>Callicolone.
<A NAME="55"></A><BR><BR>Thus did the gods spur on both hosts to fight, and rouse fierce 
<A NAME="56"></A>contention also among themselves. The sire of gods and men thundered from 
<A NAME="57"></A>heaven above, while from beneath Neptune shook the vast earth, and bade 
<A NAME="58"></A>the high hills tremble. The spurs and crests of many-fountained Ida quaked, 
<A NAME="59"></A>as also the city of the Trojans and the ships of the Achaeans. Hades, king 
<A NAME="60"></A>of the realms below, was struck with fear; he sprang panic-stricken from 
<A NAME="61"></A>his throne and cried aloud in terror lest Neptune, lord of the earthquake, 
<A NAME="62"></A>should crack the ground over his head, and lay bare his mouldy mansions 
<A NAME="63"></A>to the sight of mortals and immortals- mansions so ghastly grim that even 
<A NAME="64"></A>the gods shudder to think of them. Such was the uproar as the gods came 
<A NAME="65"></A>together in battle. Apollo with his arrows took his stand to face King 
<A NAME="66"></A>Neptune, while Minerva took hers against the god of war; the archer-goddess 
<A NAME="67"></A>Diana with her golden arrows, sister of far-darting Apollo, stood to face 
<A NAME="68"></A>Juno; Mercury the lusty bringer of good luck faced Leto, while the mighty 
<A NAME="69"></A>eddying river whom men can Scamander, but gods Xanthus, matched himself 
<A NAME="70"></A>against Vulcan.
<A NAME="71"></A><BR><BR>The gods, then, were thus ranged against one another. But the heart 
<A NAME="72"></A>of Achilles was set on meeting Hector son of Priam, for it was with his 
<A NAME="73"></A>blood that he longed above all things else to glut the stubborn lord of 
<A NAME="74"></A>battle. Meanwhile Apollo set Aeneas on to attack the son of Peleus, and 
<A NAME="75"></A>put courage into his heart, speaking with the voice of Lycaon son of Priam. 
<A NAME="76"></A>In his likeness therefore, he said to Aeneas, "Aeneas, counsellor of the 
<A NAME="77"></A>Trojans, where are now the brave words with which you vaunted over your 
<A NAME="78"></A>wine before the Trojan princes, saying that you would fight Achilles son 
<A NAME="79"></A>of Peleus in single combat?"
<A NAME="80"></A><BR><BR>And Aeneas answered, "Why do you thus bid me fight the proud son 
<A NAME="81"></A>of Peleus, when I am in no mind to do so? Were I to face him now, it would 
<A NAME="82"></A>not be for the first time. His spear has already put me to Right from Ida, 
<A NAME="83"></A>when he attacked our cattle and sacked Lyrnessus and Pedasus; Jove indeed 
<A NAME="84"></A>saved me in that he vouchsafed me strength to fly, else had the fallen 
<A NAME="85"></A>by the hands of Achilles and Minerva, who went before him to protect him 
<A NAME="86"></A>and urged him to fall upon the Lelegae and Trojans. No man may fight Achilles, 
<A NAME="87"></A>for one of the gods is always with him as his guardian angel, and even 
<A NAME="88"></A>were it not so, his weapon flies ever straight, and fails not to pierce 
<A NAME="89"></A>the flesh of him who is against him; if heaven would let me fight him on 
<A NAME="90"></A>even terms he should not soon overcome me, though he boasts that he is 
<A NAME="91"></A>made of bronze."
<A NAME="92"></A><BR><BR>Then said King Apollo, son to Jove, "Nay, hero, pray to the ever-living 
<A NAME="93"></A>gods, for men say that you were born of Jove's daughter Venus, whereas 
<A NAME="94"></A>Achilles is son to a goddess of inferior rank. Venus is child to Jove, 
<A NAME="95"></A>while Thetis is but daughter to the old man of the sea. Bring, therefore, 
<A NAME="96"></A>your spear to bear upon him, and let him not scare you with his taunts 
<A NAME="97"></A>and menaces."
<A NAME="98"></A><BR><BR>As he spoke he put courage into the heart of the shepherd of his 
<A NAME="99"></A>people, and he strode in full armour among the ranks of the foremost fighters. 
<A NAME="100"></A>Nor did the son of Anchises escape the notice of white-armed Juno, as he 
<A NAME="101"></A>went forth into the throng to meet Achilles. She called the gods about 
<A NAME="102"></A>her, and said, "Look to it, you two, Neptune and Minerva, and consider 
<A NAME="103"></A>how this shall be; Phoebus Apollo has been sending Aeneas clad in full 
<A NAME="104"></A>armour to fight Achilles. Shall we turn him back at once, or shall one 
<A NAME="105"></A>of us stand by Achilles and endow him with strength so that his heart fail 
<A NAME="106"></A>not, and he may learn that the chiefs of the immortals are on his side, 
<A NAME="107"></A>while the others who have all along been defending the Trojans are but 
<A NAME="108"></A>vain helpers? Let us all come down from Olympus and join in the fight, 
<A NAME="109"></A>that this day he may take no hurt at the hands of the Trojans. Hereafter 
<A NAME="110"></A>let him suffer whatever fate may have spun out for him when he was begotten 
<A NAME="111"></A>and his mother bore him. If Achilles be not thus assured by the voice of 
<A NAME="112"></A>a god, he may come to fear presently when one of us meets him in battle, 
<A NAME="113"></A>for the gods are terrible if they are seen face to face."
<A NAME="114"></A><BR><BR>Neptune lord of the earthquake answered her saying, "Juno, restrain 
<A NAME="115"></A>your fury; it is not well; I am not in favour of forcing the other gods 
<A NAME="116"></A>to fight us, for the advantage is too greatly on our own side; let us take 
<A NAME="117"></A>our places on some hill out of the beaten track, and let mortals fight 
<A NAME="118"></A>it out among themselves. If Mars or Phoebus Apollo begin fighting, or keep 
<A NAME="119"></A>Achilles in check so that he cannot fight, we too, will at once raise the 
<A NAME="120"></A>cry of battle, and in that case they will soon leave the field and go back 
<A NAME="121"></A>vanquished to Olympus among the other gods."
<A NAME="122"></A><BR><BR>With these words the dark-haired god led the way to the high earth-barrow 
<A NAME="123"></A>of Hercules, built round solid masonry, and made by the Trojans and Pallas 
<A NAME="124"></A>Minerva for him fly to when the sea-monster was chasing him from the shore 
<A NAME="125"></A>on to the plain. Here Neptune and those that were with him took their seats, 
<A NAME="126"></A>wrapped in a thick cloud of darkness; but the other gods seated themselves 
<A NAME="127"></A>on the brow of Callicolone round you, O Phoebus, and Mars the waster of 
<A NAME="128"></A>cities.
<A NAME="129"></A><BR><BR>Thus did the gods sit apart and form their plans, but neither side 
<A NAME="130"></A>was willing to begin battle with the other, and Jove from his seat on high 
<A NAME="131"></A>was in command over them all. Meanwhile the whole plain was alive with 
<A NAME="132"></A>men and horses, and blazing with the gleam of armour. The earth rang again 
<A NAME="133"></A>under the tramp of their feet as they rushed towards each other, and two 
<A NAME="134"></A>champions, by far the foremost of them all, met between the hosts to fight- 
<A NAME="135"></A>to wit, Aeneas son of Anchises, and noble Achilles.
<A NAME="136"></A><BR><BR>Aeneas was first to stride forward in attack, his doughty helmet 
<A NAME="137"></A>tossing defiance as he came on. He held his strong shield before his breast, 
<A NAME="138"></A>and brandished his bronze spear. The son of Peleus from the other side 
<A NAME="139"></A>sprang forth to meet him, fike some fierce lion that the whole country-side 
<A NAME="140"></A>has met to hunt and kill- at first he bodes no ill, but when some daring 
<A NAME="141"></A>youth has struck him with a spear, he crouches openmouthed, his jaws foam, 
<A NAME="142"></A>he roars with fury, he lashes his tail from side to side about his ribs 
<A NAME="143"></A>and loins, and glares as he springs straight before him, to find out whether 
<A NAME="144"></A>he is to slay, or be slain among the foremost of his foes- even with such 
<A NAME="145"></A>fury did Achilles burn to spring upon Aeneas.
<A NAME="146"></A><BR><BR>When they were now close up with one another Achilles was first 
<A NAME="147"></A>to speak. "Aeneas," said he, "why do you stand thus out before the host 
<A NAME="148"></A>to fight me? Is it that you hope to reign over the Trojans in the seat 
<A NAME="149"></A>of Priam? Nay, though you kill me Priam will not hand his kingdom over 
<A NAME="150"></A>to you. He is a man of sound judgement, and he has sons of his own. Or 
<A NAME="151"></A>have the Trojans been allotting you a demesne of passing richness, fair 
<A NAME="152"></A>with orchard lawns and corn lands, if you should slay me? This you shall 
<A NAME="153"></A>hardly do. I have discomfited you once already. Have you forgotten how 
<A NAME="154"></A>when you were alone I chased you from your herds helter-skelter down the 
<A NAME="155"></A>slopes of Ida? You did not turn round to look behind you; you took refuge 
<A NAME="156"></A>in Lyrnessus, but I attacked the city, and with the help of Minerva and 
<A NAME="157"></A>father Jove I sacked it and carried its women into captivity, though Jove 
<A NAME="158"></A>and the other gods rescued you. You think they will protect you now, but 
<A NAME="159"></A>they will not do so; therefore I say go back into the host, and do not 
<A NAME="160"></A>face me, or you will rue it. Even a fool may be wise after the 
<A NAME="161"></A>event."
<A NAME="162"></A><BR><BR>Then Aeneas answered, "Son of Peleus, think not that your words 
<A NAME="163"></A>can scare me as though I were a child. I too, if I will, can brag and talk 
<A NAME="164"></A>unseemly. We know one another's race and parentage as matters of common 
<A NAME="165"></A>fame, though neither have you ever seen my parents nor I yours. Men say 
<A NAME="166"></A>that you are son to noble Peleus, and that your mother is Thetis, fair-haired 
<A NAME="167"></A>daughter of the sea. I have noble Anchises for my father, and Venus for 
<A NAME="168"></A>my mother; the parents of one or other of us shall this day mourn a son, 
<A NAME="169"></A>for it will be more than silly talk that shall part us when the fight is 
<A NAME="170"></A>over. Learn, then, my lineage if you will- and it is known to 
<A NAME="171"></A>many.
<A NAME="172"></A><BR><BR>"In the beginning Dardanus was the son of Jove, and founded Dardania, 
<A NAME="173"></A>for Ilius was not yet stablished on the plain for men to dwell in, and 
<A NAME="174"></A>her people still abode on the spurs of many-fountained Ida. Dardanus had 
<A NAME="175"></A>a son, king Erichthonius, who was wealthiest of all men living; he had 
<A NAME="176"></A>three thousand mares that fed by the water-meadows, they and their foals 
<A NAME="177"></A>with them. Boreas was enamoured of them as they were feeding, and covered 
<A NAME="178"></A>them in the semblance of a dark-maned stallion. Twelve filly foals did 
<A NAME="179"></A>they conceive and bear him, and these, as they sped over the rich plain, 
<A NAME="180"></A>would go bounding on over the ripe ears of corn and not break them; or 
<A NAME="181"></A>again when they would disport themselves on the broad back of Ocean they 
<A NAME="182"></A>could gallop on the crest of a breaker. Erichthonius begat Tros, king of 
<A NAME="183"></A>the Trojans, and Tros had three noble sons, Ilus, Assaracus, and Ganymede 
<A NAME="184"></A>who was comeliest of mortal men; wherefore the gods carried him off to 
<A NAME="185"></A>be Jove's cupbearer, for his beauty's sake, that he might dwell among the 
<A NAME="186"></A>immortals. Ilus begat Laomedon, and Laomedon begat Tithonus, Priam, Lampus, 
<A NAME="187"></A>Clytius, and Hiketaon of the stock of Mars. But Assaracus was father to 
<A NAME="188"></A>Capys, and Capys to Anchises, who was my father, while Hector is son to 
<A NAME="189"></A>Priam.
<A NAME="190"></A><BR><BR>"Such do I declare my blood and lineage, but as for valour, Jove 
<A NAME="191"></A>gives it or takes it as he will, for he is lord of all. And now let there 
<A NAME="192"></A>be no more of this prating in mid-battle as though we were children. We 
<A NAME="193"></A>could fling taunts without end at one another; a hundred-oared galley would 
<A NAME="194"></A>not hold them. The tongue can run all whithers and talk all wise; it can 
<A NAME="195"></A>go here and there, and as a man says, so shall he be gainsaid. What is 
<A NAME="196"></A>the use of our bandying hard like women who when they fall foul of one 
<A NAME="197"></A>another go out and wrangle in the streets, one half true and the other 
<A NAME="198"></A>lies, as rage inspires them? No words of yours shall turn me now that I 
<A NAME="199"></A>am fain to fight- therefore let us make trial of one another with our 
<A NAME="200"></A>spears."
<A NAME="201"></A><BR><BR>As he spoke he drove his spear at the great and terrible shield 
<A NAME="202"></A>of Achilles, which rang out as the point struck it. The son of Peleus held 
<A NAME="203"></A>the shield before him with his strong hand, and he was afraid, for he deemed 
<A NAME="204"></A>that Aeneas's spear would go through it quite easily, not reflecting that 
<A NAME="205"></A>the god's glorious gifts were little likely to yield before the blows of 
<A NAME="206"></A>mortal men; and indeed Aeneas's spear did not pierce the shield, for the 
<A NAME="207"></A>layer of gold, gift of the god, stayed the point. It went through two layers, 
<A NAME="208"></A>but the god had made the shield in five, two of bronze, the two innermost 
<A NAME="209"></A>ones of tin, and one of gold; it was in this that the spear was 
<A NAME="210"></A>stayed.
<A NAME="211"></A><BR><BR>Achilles in his turn threw, and struck the round shield of Aeneas 
<A NAME="212"></A>at the very edge, where the bronze was thinnest; the spear of Pelian ash 
<A NAME="213"></A>went clean through, and the shield rang under the blow; Aeneas was afraid, 
<A NAME="214"></A>and crouched backwards, holding the shield away from him; the spear, however, 
<A NAME="215"></A>flew over his back, and stuck quivering in the ground, after having gone 
<A NAME="216"></A>through both circles of the sheltering shield. Aeneas though he had avoided 
<A NAME="217"></A>the spear, stood still, blinded with fear and grief because the weapon 
<A NAME="218"></A>had gone so near him; then Achilles sprang furiously upon him, with a cry 
<A NAME="219"></A>as of death and with his keen blade drawn, and Aeneas seized a great stone, 
<A NAME="220"></A>so huge that two men, as men now are, would be unable to lift it, but Aeneas 
<A NAME="221"></A>wielded it quite easily.
<A NAME="222"></A><BR><BR>Aeneas would then have struck Achilles as he was springing towards 
<A NAME="223"></A>him, either on the helmet, or on the shield that covered him, and Achilles 
<A NAME="224"></A>would have closed with him and despatched him with his sword, had not Neptune 
<A NAME="225"></A>lord of the earthquake been quick to mark, and said forthwith to the immortals, 
<A NAME="226"></A>"Alas, I am sorry for great Aeneas, who will now go down to the house of 
<A NAME="227"></A>Hades, vanquished by the son of Peleus. Fool that he was to give ear to 
<A NAME="228"></A>the counsel of Apollo. Apollo will never save him from destruction. Why 
<A NAME="229"></A>should this man suffer when he is guiltless, to no purpose, and in another's 
<A NAME="230"></A>quarrel? Has he not at all times offered acceptable sacrifice to the gods 
<A NAME="231"></A>that dwell in heaven? Let us then snatch him from death's jaws, lest the 
<A NAME="232"></A>son of Saturn be angry should Achilles slay him. It is fated, moreover, 
<A NAME="233"></A>that he should escape, and that the race of Dardanus, whom Jove loved above 
<A NAME="234"></A>all the sons born to him of mortal women, shall not perish utterly without 
<A NAME="235"></A>seed or sign. For now indeed has Jove hated the blood of Priam, while Aeneas 
<A NAME="236"></A>shall reign over the Trojans, he and his children's children that shall 
<A NAME="237"></A>be born hereafter."
<A NAME="238"></A><BR><BR>Then answered Juno, "Earth-shaker, look to this matter yourself, 
<A NAME="239"></A>and consider concerning Aeneas, whether you will save him, or suffer him, 
<A NAME="240"></A>brave though he be, to fall by the hand of Achilles son of Peleus. For 
<A NAME="241"></A>of a truth we two, I and Pallas Minerva, have sworn full many a time before 
<A NAME="242"></A>all the immortals, that never would we shield Trojans from destruction, 
<A NAME="243"></A>not even when all Troy is burning in the flames that the Achaeans shall 
<A NAME="244"></A>kindle."
<A NAME="245"></A><BR><BR>When earth-encircling Neptune heard this he went into the battle 
<A NAME="246"></A>amid the clash of spears, and came to the place where Achilles and Aeneas 
<A NAME="247"></A>were. Forthwith he shed a darkness before the eyes of the son of Peleus, 
<A NAME="248"></A>drew the bronze-headed ashen spear from the shield of Aeneas, and laid 
<A NAME="249"></A>it at the feet of Achilles. Then he lifted Aeneas on high from off the 
<A NAME="250"></A>earth and hurried him away. Over the heads of many a band of warriors both 
<A NAME="251"></A>horse and foot did he soar as the god's hand sped him, till he came to 
<A NAME="252"></A>the very fringe of the battle where the Cauconians were arming themselves 
<A NAME="253"></A>for fight. Neptune, shaker of the earth, then came near to him and said, 
<A NAME="254"></A>Aeneas, what god has egged you on to this folly in fighting the son of 
<A NAME="255"></A>Peleus, who is both a mightier man of valour and more beloved of heaven 
<A NAME="256"></A>than you are? Give way before him whensoever you meet him, lest you go 
<A NAME="257"></A>down to the house of Hades even though fate would have it otherwise. When 
<A NAME="258"></A>Achilles is dead you may then fight among the foremost undaunted, for none 
<A NAME="259"></A>other of the Achaeans shall slay you."
<A NAME="260"></A><BR><BR>The god left him when he had given him these instructions, and 
<A NAME="261"></A>at once removed the darkness from before the eyes of Achilles, who opened 
<A NAME="262"></A>them wide indeed and said in great anger, "Alas! what marvel am I now beholding? 
<A NAME="263"></A>Here is my spear upon the ground, but I see not him whom I meant to kill 
<A NAME="264"></A>when I hurled it. Of a truth Aeneas also must be under heaven's protection, 
<A NAME="265"></A>although I had thought his boasting was idle. Let him go hang; he will 
<A NAME="266"></A>be in no mood to fight me further, seeing how narrowly he has missed being 
<A NAME="267"></A>killed. I will now give my orders to the Danaans and attack some other 
<A NAME="268"></A>of the Trojans."
<A NAME="269"></A><BR><BR>He sprang forward along the line and cheered his men on as he did 
<A NAME="270"></A>so. "Let not the Trojans," he cried, "keep you at arm's length, Achaeans, 
<A NAME="271"></A>but go for them and fight them man for man. However valiant I may be, I 
<A NAME="272"></A>cannot give chase to so many and fight all of them. Even Mars, who is an 
<A NAME="273"></A>immortal, or Minerva, would shrink from flinging himself into the jaws 
<A NAME="274"></A>of such a fight and laying about him; nevertheless, so far as in me lies 
<A NAME="275"></A>I will show no slackness of hand or foot nor want of endurance, not even 
<A NAME="276"></A>for a moment; I will utterly break their ranks, and woe to the Trojan who 
<A NAME="277"></A>shall venture within reach of my spear."
<A NAME="278"></A><BR><BR>Thus did he exhort them. Meanwhile Hector called upon the Trojans 
<A NAME="279"></A>and declared that he would fight Achilles. "Be not afraid, proud Trojans," 
<A NAME="280"></A>said he, "to face the son of Peleus; I could fight gods myself if the battle 
<A NAME="281"></A>were one of words only, but they would be more than a match for me, if 
<A NAME="282"></A>we had to use our spears. Even so the deed of Achilles will fall somewhat 
<A NAME="283"></A>short of his word; he will do in part, and the other part he will clip 
<A NAME="284"></A>short. I will go up against him though his hands be as fire- though his 
<A NAME="285"></A>hands be fire and his strength iron."
<A NAME="286"></A><BR><BR>Thus urged the Trojans lifted up their spears against the Achaeans, 
<A NAME="287"></A>and raised the cry of battle as they flung themselves into the midst of 
<A NAME="288"></A>their ranks. But Phoebus Apollo came up to Hector and said, "Hector, on 
<A NAME="289"></A>no account must you challenge Achilles to single combat; keep a lookout 
<A NAME="290"></A>for him while you are under cover of the others and away from the thick 
<A NAME="291"></A>of the fight, otherwise he will either hit you with a spear or cut you 
<A NAME="292"></A>down at close quarters."
<A NAME="293"></A><BR><BR>Thus he spoke, and Hector drew back within the crowd, for he was 
<A NAME="294"></A>afraid when he heard what the god had said to him. Achilles then sprang 
<A NAME="295"></A>upon the Trojans with a terrible cry, clothed in valour as with a garment. 
<A NAME="296"></A>First he killed Iphition son of Otrynteus, a leader of much people whom 
<A NAME="297"></A>a naiad nymph had borne to Otrynteus waster of cities, in the land of Hyde 
<A NAME="298"></A>under the snowy heights of Mt. Tmolus. Achilles struck him full on the 
<A NAME="299"></A>head as he was coming on towards him, and split it clean in two; whereon 
<A NAME="300"></A>he fell heavily to the ground and Achilles vaunted over him saying, "You 
<A NAME="301"></A>he low, son of Otrynteus, mighty hero; your death is here, but your lineage 
<A NAME="302"></A>is on the Gygaean lake where your father's estate lies, by Hyllus, rich 
<A NAME="303"></A>in fish, and the eddying waters of Hermus."
<A NAME="304"></A><BR><BR>Thus did he vaunt, but darkness closed the eyes of the other. The 
<A NAME="305"></A>chariots of the Achaeans cut him up as their wheels passed over him in 
<A NAME="306"></A>the front of the battle, and after him Achilles killed Demoleon, a valiant 
<A NAME="307"></A>man of war and son to Antenor. He struck him on the temple through his 
<A NAME="308"></A>bronze-cheeked helmet. The helmet did not stay the spear, but it went right 
<A NAME="309"></A>on, crushing the bone so that the brain inside was shed in all directions, 
<A NAME="310"></A>and his lust of fighting was ended. Then he struck Hippodamas in the midriff 
<A NAME="311"></A>as he was springing down from his chariot in front of him, and trying to 
<A NAME="312"></A>escape. He breathed his last, bellowing like a bull bellows when young 
<A NAME="313"></A>men are dragging him to offer him in sacrifice to the King of Helice, and 
<A NAME="314"></A>the heart of the earth-shaker is glad; even so did he bellow as he lay 
<A NAME="315"></A>dying. Achilles then went in pursuit of Polydorus son of Priam, whom his 
<A NAME="316"></A>father had always forbidden to fight because he was the youngest of his 
<A NAME="317"></A>sons, the one he loved best, and the fastest runner. He, in his folly and 
<A NAME="318"></A>showing off the fleetness of his feet, was rushing about among front ranks 
<A NAME="319"></A>until he lost his life, for Achilles struck him in the middle of the back 
<A NAME="320"></A>as he was darting past him: he struck him just at the golden fastenings 
<A NAME="321"></A>of his belt and where the two pieces of the double breastplate overlapped. 
<A NAME="322"></A>The point of the spear pierced him through and came out by the navel, whereon 
<A NAME="323"></A>he fell groaning on to his knees and a cloud of darkness overshadowed him 
<A NAME="324"></A>as he sank holding his entrails in his hands.
<A NAME="325"></A><BR><BR>When Hector saw his brother Polydorus with his entrails in his 
<A NAME="326"></A>hands and sinking down upon the ground, a mist came over his eyes, and 
<A NAME="327"></A>he could not bear to keep longer at a distance; he therefore poised his 
<A NAME="328"></A>spear and darted towards Achilles like a flame of fire. When Achilles saw 
<A NAME="329"></A>him he bounded forward and vaunted saying, "This is he that has wounded 
<A NAME="330"></A>my heart most deeply and has slain my beloved comrade. Not for long shall 
<A NAME="331"></A>we two quail before one another on the highways of war."
<A NAME="332"></A><BR><BR>He looked fiercely on Hector and said, "Draw near, that you may 
<A NAME="333"></A>meet your doom the sooner." Hector feared him not and answered, "Son of 
<A NAME="334"></A>Peleus, think not that your words can scare me as though I were a child; 
<A NAME="335"></A>I too if I will can brag and talk unseemly; I know that you are a mighty 
<A NAME="336"></A>warrior, mightier by far than I, nevertheless the issue lies in the the 
<A NAME="337"></A>lap of heaven whether I, worse man though I be, may not slay you with my 
<A NAME="338"></A>spear, for this too has been found keen ere now."
<A NAME="339"></A><BR><BR>He hurled his spear as he spoke, but Minerva breathed upon it, 
<A NAME="340"></A>and though she breathed but very lightly she turned it back from going 
<A NAME="341"></A>towards Achilles, so that it returned to Hector and lay at his feet in 
<A NAME="342"></A>front of him. Achilles then sprang furiously on him with a loud cry, bent 
<A NAME="343"></A>on killing him, but Apollo caught him up easily as a god can, and hid him 
<A NAME="344"></A>in a thick darkness. Thrice did Achilles spring towards him spear in hand, 
<A NAME="345"></A>and thrice did he waste his blow upon the air. When he rushed forward for 
<A NAME="346"></A>the fourth time as though he were a god, he shouted aloud saying, "Hound, 
<A NAME="347"></A>this time too you have escaped death- but of a truth it came exceedingly 
<A NAME="348"></A>near you. Phoebus Apollo, to whom it seems you pray before you go into 
<A NAME="349"></A>battle, has again saved you; but if I too have any friend among the gods 
<A NAME="350"></A>I will surely make an end of you when I come across you at some other time. 
<A NAME="351"></A>Now, however, I will pursue and overtake other Trojans."
<A NAME="352"></A><BR><BR>On this he struck Dryops with his spear, about the middle of his 
<A NAME="353"></A>neck, and he fell headlong at his feet. There he let him lie and stayed 
<A NAME="354"></A>Demouchus son of Philetor, a man both brave and of great stature, by hitting 
<A NAME="355"></A>him on the knee with a spear; then he smote him with his sword and killed 
<A NAME="356"></A>him. After this he sprang on Laogonus and Dardanus, sons of Bias, and threw 
<A NAME="357"></A>them from their chariot, the one with a blow from a thrown spear, while 
<A NAME="358"></A>the other he cut down in hand-to-hand fight. There was also Tros the son 
<A NAME="359"></A>of Alastor- he came up to Achilles and clasped his knees in the hope that 
<A NAME="360"></A>he would spare him and not kill him but let him go, because they were both 
<A NAME="361"></A>of the same age. Fool, he might have known that he should not prevail with 
<A NAME="362"></A>him, for the man was in no mood for pity or forbearance but was in grim 
<A NAME="363"></A>earnest. Therefore when Tros laid hold of his knees and sought a hearing 
<A NAME="364"></A>for his prayers, Achilles drove his sword into his liver, and the liver 
<A NAME="365"></A>came rolling out, while his bosom was all covered with the black blood 
<A NAME="366"></A>that welled from the wound. Thus did death close his eyes as he lay 
<A NAME="367"></A>lifeless.
<A NAME="368"></A><BR><BR>Achilles then went up to Mulius and struck him on the ear with 
<A NAME="369"></A>a spear, and the bronze spear-head came right out at the other ear. He 
<A NAME="370"></A>also struck Echeclus son of Agenor on the head with his sword, which became 
<A NAME="371"></A>warm with the blood, while death and stern fate closed the eyes of Echeclus. 
<A NAME="372"></A>Next in order the bronze point of his spear wounded Deucalion in the fore-arm 
<A NAME="373"></A>where the sinews of the elbow are united, whereon he waited Achilles' onset 
<A NAME="374"></A>with his arm hanging down and death staring him in the face. Achilles cut 
<A NAME="375"></A>his head off with a blow from his sword and flung it helmet and all away 
<A NAME="376"></A>from him, and the marrow came oozing out of his backbone as he lay. He 
<A NAME="377"></A>then went in pursuit of Rhigmus, noble son of Peires, who had come from 
<A NAME="378"></A>fertile Thrace, and struck him through the middle with a spear which fixed 
<A NAME="379"></A>itself in his belly, so that he fell headlong from his chariot. He also 
<A NAME="380"></A>speared Areithous squire to Rhigmus in the back as he was turning his horses 
<A NAME="381"></A>in flight, and thrust him from his chariot, while the horses were struck 
<A NAME="382"></A>with panic.
<A NAME="383"></A><BR><BR>As a fire raging in some mountain glen after long drought- and 
<A NAME="384"></A>the dense forest is in a blaze, while the wind carries great tongues of 
<A NAME="385"></A>fire in every direction- even so furiously did Achilles rage, wielding 
<A NAME="386"></A>his spear as though he were a god, and giving chase to those whom he would 
<A NAME="387"></A>slay, till the dark earth ran with blood. Or as one who yokes broad-browed 
<A NAME="388"></A>oxen that they may tread barley in a threshing-floor- and it is soon bruised 
<A NAME="389"></A>small under the feet of the lowing cattle- even so did the horses of Achilles 
<A NAME="390"></A>trample on the shields and bodies of the slain. The axle underneath and 
<A NAME="391"></A>the railing that ran round the car were bespattered with clots of blood 
<A NAME="392"></A>thrown up by the horses' hoofs, and from the tyres of the wheels; but the 
<A NAME="393"></A>son of Peleus pressed on to win still further glory, and his hands were 
<A NAME="394"></A>bedrabbled with gore.
