<A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A>Thus did the Trojans watch. But Panic, comrade of blood-stained Rout, had 
<A NAME="11"></A>taken fast hold of the Achaeans and their princes were all of them in despair. 
<A NAME="12"></A>As when the two winds that blow from Thrace- the north and the northwest- 
<A NAME="13"></A>spring up of a sudden and rouse the fury of the main- in a moment the dark 
<A NAME="14"></A>waves uprear their heads and scatter their sea-wrack in all directions- 
<A NAME="15"></A>even thus troubled were the hearts of the Achaeans.
<A NAME="16"></A><BR><BR>The son of Atreus in dismay bade the heralds call the people to 
<A NAME="17"></A>a council man by man, but not to cry the matter aloud; he made haste also 
<A NAME="18"></A>himself to call them, and they sat sorry at heart in their assembly. Agamemnon 
<A NAME="19"></A>shed tears as it were a running stream or cataract on the side of some 
<A NAME="20"></A>sheer cliff; and thus, with many a heavy sigh he spoke to the Achaeans. 
<A NAME="21"></A>"My friends," said he, "princes and councillors of the Argives, the hand 
<A NAME="22"></A>of heaven has been laid heavily upon me. Cruel Jove gave me his solemn 
<A NAME="23"></A>promise that I should sack the city of Troy before returning, but he has 
<A NAME="24"></A>played me false, and is now bidding me go ingloriously back to Argos with 
<A NAME="25"></A>the loss of much people. Such is the will of Jove, who has laid many a 
<A NAME="26"></A>proud city in the dust as he will yet lay others, for his power is above 
<A NAME="27"></A>all. Now, therefore, let us all do as I say and sail back to our own country, 
<A NAME="28"></A>for we shall not take Troy."
<A NAME="29"></A><BR><BR>Thus he spoke, and the sons of the Achaeans for a long while sat 
<A NAME="30"></A>sorrowful there, but they all held their peace, till at last Diomed of 
<A NAME="31"></A>the loud battle-cry made answer saying, "Son of Atreus, I will chide your 
<A NAME="32"></A>folly, as is my right in council. Be not then aggrieved that I should do 
<A NAME="33"></A>so. In the first place you attacked me before all the Danaans and said 
<A NAME="34"></A>that I was a coward and no soldier. The Argives young and old know that 
<A NAME="35"></A>you did so. But the son of scheming Saturn endowed you by halves only. 
<A NAME="36"></A>He gave you honour as the chief ruler over us, but valour, which is the 
<A NAME="37"></A>highest both right and might he did not give you. Sir, think you that the 
<A NAME="38"></A>sons of the Achaeans are indeed as unwarlike and cowardly as you say they 
<A NAME="39"></A>are? If your own mind is set upon going home- go- the way is open to you; 
<A NAME="40"></A>the many ships that followed you from Mycene stand ranged upon the seashore; 
<A NAME="41"></A>but the rest of us stay here till we have sacked Troy. Nay though these 
<A NAME="42"></A>too should turn homeward with their ships, Sthenelus and myself will still 
<A NAME="43"></A>fight on till we reach the goal of Ilius, for for heaven was with us when 
<A NAME="44"></A>we came."
<A NAME="45"></A><BR><BR>The sons of the Achaeans shouted applause at the words of Diomed, 
<A NAME="46"></A>and presently Nestor rose to speak. "Son of Tydeus," said he, "in war your 
<A NAME="47"></A>prowess is beyond question, and in council you excel all who are of your 
<A NAME="48"></A>own years; no one of the Achaeans can make light of what you say nor gainsay 
<A NAME="49"></A>it, but you have not yet come to the end of the whole matter. You are still 
<A NAME="50"></A>young- you might be the youngest of my own children- still you have spoken 
<A NAME="51"></A>wisely and have counselled the chief of the Achaeans not without discretion; 
<A NAME="52"></A>nevertheless I am older than you and I will tell you every" thing; therefore 
<A NAME="53"></A>let no man, not even King Agamemnon, disregard my saying, for he that foments 
<A NAME="54"></A>civil discord is a clanless, hearthless outlaw.
<A NAME="55"></A><BR><BR>"Now, however, let us obey the behests of night and get our suppers, 
<A NAME="56"></A>but let the sentinels every man of them camp by the trench that is without 
<A NAME="57"></A>the wall. I am giving these instructions to the young men; when they have 
<A NAME="58"></A>been attended to, do you, son of Atreus, give your orders, for you are 
<A NAME="59"></A>the most royal among us all. Prepare a feast for your councillors; it is 
<A NAME="60"></A>right and reasonable that you should do so; there is abundance of wine 
<A NAME="61"></A>in your tents, which the ships of the Achaeans bring from Thrace daily. 
<A NAME="62"></A>You have everything at your disposal wherewith to entertain guests, and 
<A NAME="63"></A>you have many subjects. When many are got together, you can be guided by 
<A NAME="64"></A>him whose counsel is wisest- and sorely do we need shrewd and prudent counsel, 
<A NAME="65"></A>for the foe has lit his watchfires hard by our ships. Who can be other 
<A NAME="66"></A>than dismayed? This night will either be the ruin of our host, or save 
<A NAME="67"></A>it."
<A NAME="68"></A><BR><BR>Thus did he speak, and they did even as he had said. The sentinels 
<A NAME="69"></A>went out in their armour under command of Nestor's son Thrasymedes, a captain 
<A NAME="70"></A>of the host, and of the bold warriors Ascalaphus and Ialmenus: there were 
<A NAME="71"></A>also Meriones, Aphareus and Deipyrus, and the son of Creion, noble Lycomedes. 
<A NAME="72"></A>There were seven captains of the sentinels, and with each there went a 
<A NAME="73"></A>hundred youths armed with long spears: they took their places midway between 
<A NAME="74"></A>the trench and the wall, and when they had done so they lit their fires 
<A NAME="75"></A>and got every man his supper.
<A NAME="76"></A><BR><BR>The son of Atreus then bade many councillors of the Achaeans to 
<A NAME="77"></A>his quarters prepared a great feast in their honour. They laid their hands 
<A NAME="78"></A>on the good things that were before them, and as soon as they had enough 
<A NAME="79"></A>to eat and drink, old Nestor, whose counsel was ever truest, was the first 
<A NAME="80"></A>to lay his mind before them. He, therefore, with all sincerity and goodwill 
<A NAME="81"></A>addressed them thus.
<A NAME="82"></A><BR><BR>"With yourself, most noble son of Atreus, king of men, Agamemnon, 
<A NAME="83"></A>will I both begin my speech and end it, for you are king over much people. 
<A NAME="84"></A>Jove, moreover, has vouchsafed you to wield the sceptre and to uphold righteousness, 
<A NAME="85"></A>that you may take thought for your people under you; therefore it behooves 
<A NAME="86"></A>you above all others both to speak and to give ear, and to out the counsel 
<A NAME="87"></A>of another who shall have been minded to speak wisely. All turns on you 
<A NAME="88"></A>and on your commands, therefore I will say what I think will be best. No 
<A NAME="89"></A>man will be of a truer mind than that which has been mine from the hour 
<A NAME="90"></A>when you, sir, angered Achilles by taking the girl Briseis from his tent 
<A NAME="91"></A>against my judgment. I urged you not to do so, but you yielded to your 
<A NAME="92"></A>own pride, and dishonoured a hero whom heaven itself had honoured- for 
<A NAME="93"></A>you still hold the prize that had been awarded to him. Now, however, let 
<A NAME="94"></A>us think how we may appease him, both with presents and fair speeches that 
<A NAME="95"></A>may conciliate him."
<A NAME="96"></A><BR><BR>And King Agamemnon answered, "Sir, you have reproved my folly justly. 
<A NAME="97"></A>I was wrong. I own it. One whom heaven befriends is in himself a host, 
<A NAME="98"></A>and Jove has shown that he befriends this man by destroying much people 
<A NAME="99"></A>of the Achaeans. I was blinded with passion and yielded to my worser mind; 
<A NAME="100"></A>therefore I will make amends, and will give him great gifts by way of atonement. 
<A NAME="101"></A>I will tell them in the presence of you all. I will give him seven tripods 
<A NAME="102"></A>that have never yet been on the fire, and ten talents of gold. I will give 
<A NAME="103"></A>him twenty iron cauldrons and twelve strong horses that have won races 
<A NAME="104"></A>and carried off prizes. Rich, indeed, both in land and gold is he that 
<A NAME="105"></A>has as many prizes as my horses have won me. I will give him seven excellent 
<A NAME="106"></A>workwomen, Lesbians, whom I chose for myself when he took Lesbos- all of 
<A NAME="107"></A>surpassing beauty. I will give him these, and with them her whom I erewhile 
<A NAME="108"></A>took from him, the daughter of Briseus; and I swear a great oath that I 
<A NAME="109"></A>never went up into her couch, nor have been with her after the manner of 
<A NAME="110"></A>men and women.
<A NAME="111"></A><BR><BR>"All these things will I give him now down, and if hereafter the 
<A NAME="112"></A>gods vouchsafe me to sack the city of Priam, let him come when we Achaeans 
<A NAME="113"></A>are dividing the spoil, and load his ship with gold and bronze to his liking; 
<A NAME="114"></A>furthermore let him take twenty Trojan women, the loveliest after Helen 
<A NAME="115"></A>herself. Then, when we reach Achaean Argos, wealthiest of all lands, he 
<A NAME="116"></A>shall be my son-in-law and I will show him like honour with my own dear 
<A NAME="117"></A>son Orestes, who is being nurtured in all abundance. I have three daughters, 
<A NAME="118"></A>Chrysothemis, Laodice, and lphianassa, let him take the one of his choice, 
<A NAME="119"></A>freely and without gifts of wooing, to the house of Peleus; I will add 
<A NAME="120"></A>such dower to boot as no man ever yet gave his daughter, and will give 
<A NAME="121"></A>him seven well established cities, Cardamyle, Enope, and Hire, where there 
<A NAME="122"></A>is grass; holy Pherae and the rich meadows of Anthea; Aepea also, and the 
<A NAME="123"></A>vine-clad slopes of Pedasus, all near the sea, and on the borders of sandy 
<A NAME="124"></A>Pylos. The men that dwell there are rich in cattle and sheep; they will 
<A NAME="125"></A>honour him with gifts as though he were a god, and be obedient to his comfortable 
<A NAME="126"></A>ordinances. All this will I do if he will now forgo his anger. Let him 
<A NAME="127"></A>then yieldit is only Hades who is utterly ruthless and unyielding- and 
<A NAME="128"></A>hence he is of all gods the one most hateful to mankind. Moreover I am 
<A NAME="129"></A>older and more royal than himself. Therefore, let him now obey 
<A NAME="130"></A>me."
<A NAME="131"></A><BR><BR>Then Nestor answered, "Most noble son of Atreus, king of men, Agamemnon. 
<A NAME="132"></A>The gifts you offer are no small ones, let us then send chosen messengers, 
<A NAME="133"></A>who may go to the tent of Achilles son of Peleus without delay. Let those 
<A NAME="134"></A>go whom I shall name. Let Phoenix, dear to Jove, lead the way; let Ajax 
<A NAME="135"></A>and Ulysses follow, and let the heralds Odius and Eurybates go with them. 
<A NAME="136"></A>Now bring water for our hands, and bid all keep silence while we pray to 
<A NAME="137"></A>Jove the son of Saturn, if so be that he may have mercy upon 
<A NAME="138"></A>us."
<A NAME="139"></A><BR><BR>Thus did he speak, and his saying pleased them well. Men-servants 
<A NAME="140"></A>poured water over the hands of the guests, while pages filled the mixing-bowls 
<A NAME="141"></A>with wine and water, and handed it round after giving every man his drink-offering; 
<A NAME="142"></A>then, when they had made their offerings, and had drunk each as much as 
<A NAME="143"></A>he was minded, the envoys set out from the tent of Agamemnon son of Atreus; 
<A NAME="144"></A>and Nestor, looking first to one and then to another, but most especially 
<A NAME="145"></A>at Ulysses, was instant with them that they should prevail with the noble 
<A NAME="146"></A>son of Peleus.
<A NAME="147"></A><BR><BR>They went their way by the shore of the sounding sea, and prayed 
<A NAME="148"></A>earnestly to earth-encircling Neptune that the high spirit of the son of 
<A NAME="149"></A>Aeacus might incline favourably towards them. When they reached the ships 
<A NAME="150"></A>and tents of the Myrmidons, they found Achilles playing on a lyre, fair, 
<A NAME="151"></A>of cunning workmanship, and its cross-bar was of silver. It was part of 
<A NAME="152"></A>the spoils which he had taken when he sacked the city of Eetion, and he 
<A NAME="153"></A>was now diverting himself with it and singing the feats of heroes. He was 
<A NAME="154"></A>alone with Patroclus, who sat opposite to him and said nothing, waiting 
<A NAME="155"></A>till he should cease singing. Ulysses and Ajax now came in- Ulysses leading 
<A NAME="156"></A>the way -and stood before him. Achilles sprang from his seat with the lyre 
<A NAME="157"></A>still in his hand, and Patroclus, when he saw the strangers, rose also. 
<A NAME="158"></A>Achilles then greeted them saying, "All hail and welcome- you must come 
<A NAME="159"></A>upon some great matter, you, who for all my anger are still dearest to 
<A NAME="160"></A>me of the Achaeans."
<A NAME="161"></A><BR><BR>With this he led them forward, and bade them sit on seats covered 
<A NAME="162"></A>with purple rugs; then he said to Patroclus who was close by him, "Son 
<A NAME="163"></A>of Menoetius, set a larger bowl upon the table, mix less water with the 
<A NAME="164"></A>wine, and give every man his cup, for these are very dear friends, who 
<A NAME="165"></A>are now under my roof."
<A NAME="166"></A><BR><BR>Patroclus did as his comrade bade him; he set the chopping-block 
<A NAME="167"></A>in front of the fire, and on it he laid the loin of a sheep, the loin also 
<A NAME="168"></A>of a goat, and the chine of a fat hog. Automedon held the meat while Achilles 
<A NAME="169"></A>chopped it; he then sliced the pieces and put them on spits while the son 
<A NAME="170"></A>of Menoetius made the fire burn high. When the flame had died down, he 
<A NAME="171"></A>spread the embers, laid the spits on top of them, lifting them up and setting 
<A NAME="172"></A>them upon the spit-racks; and he sprinkled them with salt. When the meat 
<A NAME="173"></A>was roasted, he set it on platters, and handed bread round the table in 
<A NAME="174"></A>fair baskets, while Achilles dealt them their portions. Then Achilles took 
<A NAME="175"></A>his seat facing Ulysses against the opposite wall, and bade his comrade 
<A NAME="176"></A>Patroclus offer sacrifice to the gods; so he cast the offerings into the 
<A NAME="177"></A>fire, and they laid their hands upon the good things that were before them. 
<A NAME="178"></A>As soon as they had had enough to eat and drink, Ajax made a sign to Phoenix, 
<A NAME="179"></A>and when he saw this, Ulysses filled his cup with wine and pledged 
<A NAME="180"></A>Achilles.
<A NAME="181"></A><BR><BR>"Hail," said he, "Achilles, we have had no scant of good cheer, 
<A NAME="182"></A>neither in the tent of Agamemnon, nor yet here; there has been plenty to 
<A NAME="183"></A>eat and drink, but our thought turns upon no such matter. Sir, we are in 
<A NAME="184"></A>the face of great disaster, and without your help know not whether we shall 
<A NAME="185"></A>save our fleet or lose it. The Trojans and their allies have camped hard 
<A NAME="186"></A>by our ships and by the wall; they have lit watchfires throughout their 
<A NAME="187"></A>host and deem that nothing can now prevent them from falling on our fleet. 
<A NAME="188"></A>Jove, moreover, has sent his lightnings on their right; Hector, in all 
<A NAME="189"></A>his glory, rages like a maniac; confident that Jove is with him he fears 
<A NAME="190"></A>neither god nor man, but is gone raving mad, and prays for the approach 
<A NAME="191"></A>of day. He vows that he will hew the high sterns of our ships in pieces, 
<A NAME="192"></A>set fire to their hulls, and make havoc of the Achaeans while they are 
<A NAME="193"></A>dazed and smothered in smoke; I much fear that heaven will make good his 
<A NAME="194"></A>boasting, and it will prove our lot to perish at Troy far from our home 
<A NAME="195"></A>in Argos. Up, then, and late though it be, save the sons of the Achaeans 
<A NAME="196"></A>who faint before the fury of the Trojans. You will repent bitterly hereafter 
<A NAME="197"></A>if you do not, for when the harm is done there will be no curing it; consider 
<A NAME="198"></A>ere it be too late, and save the Danaans from destruction.
<A NAME="199"></A><BR><BR>"My good friend, when your father Peleus sent you from Phthia to 
<A NAME="200"></A>Agamemnon, did he not charge you saying, 'Son, Minerva and Juno will make 
<A NAME="201"></A>you strong if they choose, but check your high temper, for the better part 
<A NAME="202"></A>is in goodwill. Eschew vain quarrelling, and the Achaeans old and young 
<A NAME="203"></A>will respect you more for doing so.' These were his words, but you have 
<A NAME="204"></A>forgotten them. Even now, however, be appeased, and put away your anger 
<A NAME="205"></A>from you. Agamemnon will make you great amends if you will forgive him; 
<A NAME="206"></A>listen, and I will tell you what he has said in his tent that he will give 
<A NAME="207"></A>you. He will give you seven tripods that have never yet been on the fire, 
<A NAME="208"></A>and ten talents of gold; twenty iron cauldrons, and twelve strong horses 
<A NAME="209"></A>that have won races and carried off prizes. Rich indeed both in land and 
<A NAME="210"></A>gold is he who has as many prizes as these horses have won for Agamemnon. 
<A NAME="211"></A>Moreover he will give you seven excellent workwomen, Lesbians, whom he 
<A NAME="212"></A>chose for himself, when you took Lesbos- all of surpassing beauty. He will 
<A NAME="213"></A>give you these, and with them her whom he erewhile took from you, the daughter 
<A NAME="214"></A>of Briseus, and he will swear a great oath, he has never gone up into her 
<A NAME="215"></A>couch nor been with her after the manner of men and women. All these things 
<A NAME="216"></A>will he give you now down, and if hereafter the gods vouchsafe him to sack 
<A NAME="217"></A>the city of Priam, you can come when we Achaeans are dividing the spoil, 
<A NAME="218"></A>and load your ship with gold and bronze to your liking. You can take twenty 
<A NAME="219"></A>Trojan women, the loveliest after Helen herself. Then, when we reach Achaean 
<A NAME="220"></A>Argos, wealthiest of all lands, you shall be his son-in-law, and he will 
<A NAME="221"></A>show you like honour with his own dear son Orestes, who is being nurtured 
<A NAME="222"></A>in all abundance. Agamemnon has three daughters, Chrysothemis, Laodice, 
<A NAME="223"></A>and Iphianassa; you may take the one of your choice, freely and without 
<A NAME="224"></A>gifts of wooing, to the house of Peleus; he will add such dower to boot 
<A NAME="225"></A>as no man ever yet gave his daughter, and will give you seven well-established 
<A NAME="226"></A>cities, Cardamyle, Enope, and Hire where there is grass; holy Pheras and 
<A NAME="227"></A>the rich meadows of Anthea; Aepea also, and the vine-clad slopes of Pedasus, 
<A NAME="228"></A>all near the sea, and on the borders of sandy Pylos. The men that dwell 
<A NAME="229"></A>there are rich in cattle and sheep; they will honour you with gifts as 
<A NAME="230"></A>though were a god, and be obedient to your comfortable ordinances. All 
<A NAME="231"></A>this will he do if you will now forgo your anger. Moreover, though you 
<A NAME="232"></A>hate both him and his gifts with all your heart, yet pity the rest of the 
<A NAME="233"></A>Achaeans who are being harassed in all their host; they will honour you 
<A NAME="234"></A>as a god, and you will earn great glory at their hands. You might even 
<A NAME="235"></A>kill Hector; he will come within your reach, for he is infatuated, and 
<A NAME="236"></A>declares that not a Danaan whom the ships have brought can hold his own 
<A NAME="237"></A>against him."
<A NAME="238"></A><BR><BR>Achilles answered, "Ulysses, noble son of Laertes, I should give 
<A NAME="239"></A>you formal notice plainly and in all fixity of purpose that there be no 
<A NAME="240"></A>more of this cajoling, from whatsoever quarter it may come. Him do I hate 
<A NAME="241"></A>even as the gates of hell who says one thing while he hides another in 
<A NAME="242"></A>his heart; therefore I will say what I mean. I will be appeased neither 
<A NAME="243"></A>by Agamemnon son of Atreus nor by any other of the Danaans, for I see that 
<A NAME="244"></A>I have no thanks for all my fighting. He that fights fares no better than 
<A NAME="245"></A>he that does not; coward and hero are held in equal honour, and death deals 
<A NAME="246"></A>like measure to him who works and him who is idle. I have taken nothing 
<A NAME="247"></A>by all my hardships- with my life ever in my hand; as a bird when she has 
<A NAME="248"></A>found a morsel takes it to her nestlings, and herself fares hardly, even 
<A NAME="249"></A>so man a long night have I been wakeful, and many a bloody battle have 
<A NAME="250"></A>I waged by day against those who were fighting for their women. With my 
<A NAME="251"></A>ships I have taken twelve cities, and eleven round about Troy have I stormed 
<A NAME="252"></A>with my men by land; I took great store of wealth from every one of them, 
<A NAME="253"></A>but I gave all up to Agamemnon son of Atreus. He stayed where he was by 
<A NAME="254"></A>his ships, yet of what came to him he gave little, and kept much 
<A NAME="255"></A>himself.
<A NAME="256"></A><BR><BR>"Nevertheless he did distribute some meeds of honour among the 
<A NAME="257"></A>chieftains and kings, and these have them still; from me alone of the Achaeans 
<A NAME="258"></A>did he take the woman in whom I delighted- let him keep her and sleep with 
<A NAME="259"></A>her. Why, pray, must the Argives needs fight the Trojans? What made the 
<A NAME="260"></A>son of Atreus gather the host and bring them? Was it not for the sake of 
<A NAME="261"></A>Helen? Are the sons of Atreus the only men in the world who love their 
<A NAME="262"></A>wives? Any man of common right feeling will love and cherish her who is 
<A NAME="263"></A>his own, as I this woman, with my whole heart, though she was but a fruitling 
<A NAME="264"></A>of my spear. Agamemnon has taken her from me; he has played me false; I 
<A NAME="265"></A>know him; let him tempt me no further, for he shall not move me. Let him 
<A NAME="266"></A>look to you, Ulysses, and to the other princes to save his ships from burning. 
<A NAME="267"></A>He has done much without me already. He has built a wall; he has dug a 
<A NAME="268"></A>trench deep and wide all round it, and he has planted it within with stakes; 
<A NAME="269"></A>but even so he stays not the murderous might of Hector. So long as I fought 
<A NAME="270"></A>the Achaeans Hector suffered not the battle range far from the city walls; 
<A NAME="271"></A>he would come to the Scaean gates and to the oak tree, but no further. 
<A NAME="272"></A>Once he stayed to meet me and hardly did he escape my onset: now, however, 
<A NAME="273"></A>since I am in no mood to fight him, I will to-morrow offer sacrifice to 
<A NAME="274"></A>Jove and to all the gods; I will draw my ships into the water and then 
<A NAME="275"></A>victual them duly; to-morrow morning, if you care to look, you will see 
<A NAME="276"></A>my ships on the Hellespont, and my men rowing out to sea with might and 
<A NAME="277"></A>main. If great Neptune vouchsafes me a fair passage, in three days I shall 
<A NAME="278"></A>be in Phthia. I have much there that I left behind me when I came here 
<A NAME="279"></A>to my sorrow, and I shall bring back still further store of gold, of red 
<A NAME="280"></A>copper, of fair women, and of iron, my share of the spoils that we have 
<A NAME="281"></A>taken; but one prize, he who gave has insolently taken away. Tell him all 
<A NAME="282"></A>as I now bid you, and tell him in public that the Achaeans may hate him 
<A NAME="283"></A>and beware of him should he think that he can yet dupe others for his effrontery 
<A NAME="284"></A>never fails him.
<A NAME="285"></A><BR><BR>"As for me, hound that he is, he dares not look me in the face. 
<A NAME="286"></A>I will take no counsel with him, and will undertake nothing in common with 
<A NAME="287"></A>him. He has wronged me and deceived me enough, he shall not cozen me further; 
<A NAME="288"></A>let him go his own way, for Jove has robbed him of his reason. I loathe 
<A NAME="289"></A>his presents, and for himself care not one straw. He may offer me ten or 
<A NAME="290"></A>even twenty times what he has now done, nay- not though it be all that 
<A NAME="291"></A>he has in the world, both now or ever shall have; he may promise me the 
<A NAME="292"></A>wealth of Orchomenus or of Egyptian Thebes, which is the richest city in 
<A NAME="293"></A>the whole world, for it has a hundred gates through each of which two hundred 
<A NAME="294"></A>men may drive at once with their chariots and horses; he may offer me gifts 
<A NAME="295"></A>as the sands of the sea or the dust of the plain in multitude, but even 
<A NAME="296"></A>so he shall not move me till I have been revenged in full for the bitter 
<A NAME="297"></A>wrong he has done me. I will not marry his daughter; she may be fair as 
<A NAME="298"></A>Venus, and skilful as Minerva, but I will have none of her: let another 
<A NAME="299"></A>take her, who may be a good match for her and who rules a larger kingdom. 
<A NAME="300"></A>If the gods spare me to return home, Peleus will find me a wife; there 
<A NAME="301"></A>are Achaean women in Hellas and Phthia, daughters of kings that have cities 
<A NAME="302"></A>under them; of these I can take whom I will and marry her. Many a time 
<A NAME="303"></A>was I minded when at home in Phthia to woo and wed a woman who would make 
<A NAME="304"></A>me a suitable wife, and to enjoy the riches of my old father Peleus. My 
<A NAME="305"></A>life is more to me than all the wealth of Ilius while it was yet at peace 
<A NAME="306"></A>before the Achaeans went there, or than all the treasure that lies on the 
<A NAME="307"></A>stone floor of Apollo's temple beneath the cliffs of Pytho. Cattle and 
<A NAME="308"></A>sheep are to be had for harrying, and a man buy both tripods and horses 
<A NAME="309"></A>if he wants them, but when his life has once left him it can neither be 
<A NAME="310"></A>bought nor harried back again.
<A NAME="311"></A><BR><BR>"My mother Thetis tells me that there are two ways in which I may 
<A NAME="312"></A>meet my end. If I stay here and fight, I shall not return alive but my 
<A NAME="313"></A>name will live for ever: whereas if I go home my name will die, but it 
<A NAME="314"></A>will be long ere death shall take me. To the rest of you, then, I say, 
<A NAME="315"></A>'Go home, for you will not take Ilius.' Jove has held his hand over her 
<A NAME="316"></A>to protect her, and her people have taken heart. Go, therefore, as in duty 
<A NAME="317"></A>bound, and tell the princes of the Achaeans the message that I have sent 
<A NAME="318"></A>them; tell them to find some other plan for the saving of their ships and 
<A NAME="319"></A>people, for so long as my displeasure lasts the one that they have now 
<A NAME="320"></A>hit upon may not be. As for Phoenix, let him sleep here that he may sail 
<A NAME="321"></A>with me in the morning if he so will. But I will not take him by 
<A NAME="322"></A>force."
<A NAME="323"></A><BR><BR>They all held their peace, dismayed at the sternness with which 
<A NAME="324"></A>he had denied them, till presently the old knight Phoenix in his great 
<A NAME="325"></A>fear for the ships of the Achaeans, burst into tears and said, "Noble Achilles, 
<A NAME="326"></A>if you are now minded to return, and in the fierceness of your anger will 
<A NAME="327"></A>do nothing to save the ships from burning, how, my son, can I remain here 
<A NAME="328"></A>without you? Your father Peleus bade me go with you when he sent you as 
<A NAME="329"></A>a mere lad from Phthia to Agamemnon. You knew nothing neither of war nor 
<A NAME="330"></A>of the arts whereby men make their mark in council, and he sent me with 
<A NAME="331"></A>you to train you in all excellence of speech and action. Therefore, my 
<A NAME="332"></A>son, I will not stay here without you- no, not though heaven itself vouchsafe 
<A NAME="333"></A>to strip my years from off me, and make me young as I was when I first 
<A NAME="334"></A>left Hellas the land of fair women. I was then flying the anger of father 
<A NAME="335"></A>Amyntor, son of Ormenus, who was furious with me in the matter of his concubine, 
<A NAME="336"></A>of whom he was enamoured to the wronging of his wife my mother. My mother, 
<A NAME="337"></A>therefore, prayed me without ceasing to lie with the woman myself, that 
<A NAME="338"></A>so she hate my father, and in the course of time I yielded. But my father 
<A NAME="339"></A>soon came to know, and cursed me bitterly, calling the dread Erinyes to 
<A NAME="340"></A>witness. He prayed that no son of mine might ever sit upon knees- and the 
<A NAME="341"></A>gods, Jove of the world below and awful Proserpine, fulfilled his curse. 
<A NAME="342"></A>I took counsel to kill him, but some god stayed my rashness and bade me 
<A NAME="343"></A>think on men's evil tongues and how I should be branded as the murderer 
<A NAME="344"></A>of my father: nevertheless I could not bear to stay in my father's house 
<A NAME="345"></A>with him so bitter a against me. My cousins and clansmen came about me, 
<A NAME="346"></A>and pressed me sorely to remain; many a sheep and many an ox did they slaughter, 
<A NAME="347"></A>and many a fat hog did they set down to roast before the fire; many a jar, 
<A NAME="348"></A>too, did they broach of my father's wine. Nine whole nights did they set 
<A NAME="349"></A>a guard over me taking it in turns to watch, and they kept a fire always 
<A NAME="350"></A>burning, both in the cloister of the outer court and in the inner court 
<A NAME="351"></A>at the doors of the room wherein I lay; but when the darkness of the tenth 
<A NAME="352"></A>night came, I broke through the closed doors of my room, and climbed the 
<A NAME="353"></A>wall of the outer court after passing quickly and unperceived through the 
<A NAME="354"></A>men on guard and the women servants. I then fled through Hellas till I 
<A NAME="355"></A>came to fertile Phthia, mother of sheep, and to King Peleus, who made me 
<A NAME="356"></A>welcome and treated me as a father treats an only son who will be heir 
<A NAME="357"></A>to all his wealth. He made me rich and set me over much people, establishing 
<A NAME="358"></A>me on the borders of Phthia where I was chief ruler over the 
<A NAME="359"></A>Dolopians.
<A NAME="360"></A><BR><BR>"It was I, Achilles, who had the making of you; I loved you with 
<A NAME="361"></A>all my heart: for you would eat neither at home nor when you had gone out 
<A NAME="362"></A>elsewhere, till I had first set you upon my knees, cut up the dainty morsel 
<A NAME="363"></A>that you were to eat, and held the wine-cup to your lips. Many a time have 
<A NAME="364"></A>you slobbered your wine in baby helplessness over my shirt; I had infinite 
<A NAME="365"></A>trouble with you, but I knew that heaven had vouchsafed me no offspring 
<A NAME="366"></A>of my own, and I made a son of you, Achilles, that in my hour of need you 
<A NAME="367"></A>might protect me. Now, therefore, I say battle with your pride and beat 
<A NAME="368"></A>it; cherish not your anger for ever; the might and majesty of heaven are 
<A NAME="369"></A>more than ours, but even heaven may be appeased; and if a man has sinned 
<A NAME="370"></A>he prays the gods, and reconciles them to himself by his piteous cries 
<A NAME="371"></A>and by frankincense, with drink-offerings and the savour of burnt sacrifice. 
<A NAME="372"></A>For prayers are as daughters to great Jove; halt, wrinkled, with eyes askance, 
<A NAME="373"></A>they follow in the footsteps of sin, who, being fierce and fleet of foot, 
<A NAME="374"></A>leaves them far behind him, and ever baneful to mankind outstrips them 
<A NAME="375"></A>even to the ends of the world; but nevertheless the prayers come hobbling 
<A NAME="376"></A>and healing after. If a man has pity upon these daughters of Jove when 
<A NAME="377"></A>they draw near him, they will bless him and hear him too when he is praying; 
<A NAME="378"></A>but if he deny them and will not listen to them, they go to Jove the son 
<A NAME="379"></A>of Saturn and pray that he may presently fall into sin- to his ruing bitterly 
<A NAME="380"></A>hereafter. Therefore, Achilles, give these daughters of Jove due reverence, 
<A NAME="381"></A>and bow before them as all good men will bow. Were not the son of Atreus 
<A NAME="382"></A>offering you gifts and promising others later- if he were still furious 
<A NAME="383"></A>and implacable- I am not he that would bid you throw off your anger and 
<A NAME="384"></A>help the Achaeans, no matter how great their need; but he is giving much 
<A NAME="385"></A>now, and more hereafter; he has sent his captains to urge his suit, and 
<A NAME="386"></A>has chosen those who of all the Argives are most acceptable to you; make 
<A NAME="387"></A>not then their words and their coming to be of none effect. Your anger 
<A NAME="388"></A>has been righteous so far. We have heard in song how heroes of old time 
<A NAME="389"></A>quarrelled when they were roused to fury, but still they could be won by 
<A NAME="390"></A>gifts, and fair words could soothe them.
<A NAME="391"></A><BR><BR>"I have an old story in my mind- a very old one- but you are all 
<A NAME="392"></A>friends and I will tell it. The Curetes and the Aetolians were fighting 
<A NAME="393"></A>and killing one another round Calydon- the Aetolians defending the city 
<A NAME="394"></A>and the Curetes trying to destroy it. For Diana of the golden throne was 
<A NAME="395"></A>angry and did them hurt because Oeneus had not offered her his harvest 
<A NAME="396"></A>first-fruits. The other gods had all been feasted with hecatombs, but to 
<A NAME="397"></A>the daughter of great Jove alone he had made no sacrifice. He had forgotten 
<A NAME="398"></A>her, or somehow or other it had escaped him, and this was a grievous sin. 
<A NAME="399"></A>Thereon the archer goddess in her displeasure sent a prodigious creature 
<A NAME="400"></A>against him- a savage wild boar with great white tusks that did much harm 
<A NAME="401"></A>to his orchard lands, uprooting apple-trees in full bloom and throwing 
<A NAME="402"></A>them to the ground. But Meleager son of Oeneus got huntsmen and hounds 
<A NAME="403"></A>from many cities and killed it- for it was so monstrous that not a few 
<A NAME="404"></A>were needed, and many a man did it stretch upon his funeral pyre. On this 
<A NAME="405"></A>the goddess set the Curetes and the Aetolians fighting furiously about 
<A NAME="406"></A>the head and skin of the boar.
<A NAME="407"></A><BR><BR>"So long as Meleager was in the field things went badly with the 
<A NAME="408"></A>Curetes, and for all their numbers they could not hold their ground under 
<A NAME="409"></A>the city walls; but in the course of time Meleager was angered as even 
<A NAME="410"></A>a wise man will sometimes be. He was incensed with his mother Althaea, 
<A NAME="411"></A>and therefore stayed at home with his wedded wife fair Cleopatra, who was 
<A NAME="412"></A>daughter of Marpessa daughter of Euenus, and of Ides the man then living. 
<A NAME="413"></A>He it was who took his bow and faced King Apollo himself for fair Marpessa's 
<A NAME="414"></A>sake; her father and mother then named her Alcyone, because her mother 
<A NAME="415"></A>had mourned with the plaintive strains of the halcyon-bird when Phoebus 
<A NAME="416"></A>Apollo had carried her off. Meleager, then, stayed at home with Cleopatra, 
<A NAME="417"></A>nursing the anger which he felt by reason of his mother's curses. His mother, 
<A NAME="418"></A>grieving for the death of her brother, prayed the gods, and beat the earth 
<A NAME="419"></A>with her hands, calling upon Hades and on awful Proserpine; she went down 
<A NAME="420"></A>upon her knees and her bosom was wet with tears as she prayed that they 
<A NAME="421"></A>would kill her son- and Erinys that walks in darkness and knows no ruth 
<A NAME="422"></A>heard her from Erebus.
<A NAME="423"></A><BR><BR>"Then was heard the din of battle about the gates of Calydon, and 
<A NAME="424"></A>the dull thump of the battering against their walls. Thereon the elders 
<A NAME="425"></A>of the Aetolians besought Meleager; they sent the chiefest of their priests, 
<A NAME="426"></A>and begged him to come out and help them, promising him a great reward. 
<A NAME="427"></A>They bade him choose fifty plough-gates, the most fertile in the plain 
<A NAME="428"></A>of Calydon, the one-half vineyard and the other open plough-land. The old 
<A NAME="429"></A>warrior Oeneus implored him, standing at the threshold of his room and 
<A NAME="430"></A>beating the doors in supplication. His sisters and his mother herself besought 
<A NAME="431"></A>him sore, but he the more refused them; those of his comrades who were 
<A NAME="432"></A>nearest and dearest to him also prayed him, but they could not move him 
<A NAME="433"></A>till the foe was battering at the very doors of his chamber, and the Curetes 
<A NAME="434"></A>had scaled the walls and were setting fire to the city. Then at last his 
<A NAME="435"></A>sorrowing wife detailed the horrors that befall those whose city is taken; 
<A NAME="436"></A>she reminded him how the men are slain, and the city is given over to the 
<A NAME="437"></A>flames, while the women and children are carried into captivity; when he 
<A NAME="438"></A>heard all this, his heart was touched, and he donned his armour to go forth. 
<A NAME="439"></A>Thus of his own inward motion he saved the city of the Aetolians; but they 
<A NAME="440"></A>now gave him nothing of those rich rewards that they had offered earlier, 
<A NAME="441"></A>and though he saved the city he took nothing by it. Be not then, my son, 
<A NAME="442"></A>thus minded; let not heaven lure you into any such course. When the ships 
<A NAME="443"></A>are burning it will be a harder matter to save them. Take the gifts, and 
<A NAME="444"></A>go, for the Achaeans will then honour you as a god; whereas if you fight 
<A NAME="445"></A>without taking them, you may beat the battle back, but you will not be 
<A NAME="446"></A>held in like honour."
<A NAME="447"></A><BR><BR>And Achilles answered, "Phoenix, old friend and father, I have 
<A NAME="448"></A>no need of such honour. I have honour from Jove himself, which will abide 
<A NAME="449"></A>with me at my ships while I have breath in my body, and my limbs are strong. 
<A NAME="450"></A>I say further- and lay my saying to your heart- vex me no more with this 
<A NAME="451"></A>weeping and lamentation, all in the cause of the son of Atreus. Love him 
<A NAME="452"></A>so well, and you may lose the love I bear you. You ought to help me rather 
<A NAME="453"></A>in troubling those that trouble me; be king as much as I am, and share 
<A NAME="454"></A>like honour with myself; the others shall take my answer; stay here yourself 
<A NAME="455"></A>and sleep comfortably in your bed; at daybreak we will consider whether 
<A NAME="456"></A>to remain or go."
<A NAME="457"></A><BR><BR>On this she nodded quietly to Patroclus as a sign that he was to 
<A NAME="458"></A>prepare a bed for Phoenix, and that the others should take their leave. 
<A NAME="459"></A>Ajax son of Telamon then said, "Ulysses, noble son of Laertes, let us be 
<A NAME="460"></A>gone, for I see that our journey is vain. We must now take our answer, 
<A NAME="461"></A>unwelcome though it be, to the Danaans who are waiting to receive it. Achilles 
<A NAME="462"></A>is savage and remorseless; he is cruel, and cares nothing for the love 
<A NAME="463"></A>his comrades lavished upon him more than on all the others. He is implacable- 
<A NAME="464"></A>and yet if a man's brother or son has been slain he will accept a fine 
<A NAME="465"></A>by way of amends from him that killed him, and the wrong-doer having paid 
<A NAME="466"></A>in full remains in peace among his own people; but as for you, Achilles, 
<A NAME="467"></A>the gods have put a wicked unforgiving spirit in your heart, and this, 
<A NAME="468"></A>all about one single girl, whereas we now offer you the seven best we have, 
<A NAME="469"></A>and much else into the bargain. Be then of a more gracious mind, respect 
<A NAME="470"></A>the hospitality of your own roof. We are with you as messengers from the 
<A NAME="471"></A>host of the Danaans, and would fain he held nearest and dearest to yourself 
<A NAME="472"></A>of all the Achaeans."
<A NAME="473"></A><BR><BR>"Ajax," replied Achilles, "noble son of Telamon, you have spoken 
<A NAME="474"></A>much to my liking, but my blood boils when I think it all over, and remember 
<A NAME="475"></A>how the son of Atreus treated me with contumely as though I were some vile 
<A NAME="476"></A>tramp, and that too in the presence of the Argives. Go, then, and deliver 
<A NAME="477"></A>your message; say that I will have no concern with fighting till Hector, 
<A NAME="478"></A>son of noble Priam, reaches the tents of the Myrmidons in his murderous 
<A NAME="479"></A>course, and flings fire upon their ships. For all his lust of battle, I 
<A NAME="480"></A>take it he will be held in check when he is at my own tent and 
<A NAME="481"></A>ship."
<A NAME="482"></A><BR><BR>On this they took every man his double cup, made their drink-offerings, 
<A NAME="483"></A>and went back to the ships, Ulysses leading the way. But Patroclus told 
<A NAME="484"></A>his men and the maid-servants to make ready a comfortable bed for Phoenix; 
<A NAME="485"></A>they therefore did so with sheepskins, a rug, and a sheet of fine linen. 
<A NAME="486"></A>The old man then laid himself down and waited till morning came. But Achilles 
<A NAME="487"></A>slept in an inner room, and beside him the daughter of Phorbas lovely Diomede, 
<A NAME="488"></A>whom he had carried off from Lesbos. Patroclus lay on the other side of 
<A NAME="489"></A>the room, and with him fair Iphis whom Achilles had given him when he took 
<A NAME="490"></A>Scyros the city of Enyeus.
<A NAME="491"></A><BR><BR>When the envoys reached the tents of the son of Atreus, the Achaeans 
<A NAME="492"></A>rose, pledged them in cups of gold, and began to question them. King Agamemnon 
<A NAME="493"></A>was the first to do so. Tell me, Ulysses," said he, "will he save the ships 
<A NAME="494"></A>from burning, or did be refuse, and is he still furious?"
<A NAME="495"></A><BR><BR>Ulysses answered, "Most noble son of Atreus, king of men, Agamemnon, 
<A NAME="496"></A>Achilles will not be calmed, but is more fiercely angry than ever, and 
<A NAME="497"></A>spurns both you and your gifts. He bids you take counsel with the Achaeans 
<A NAME="498"></A>to save the ships and host as you best may; as for himself, he said that 
<A NAME="499"></A>at daybreak he should draw his ships into the water. He said further that 
<A NAME="500"></A>he should advise every one to sail home likewise, for that you will not 
<A NAME="501"></A>reach the goal of Ilius. 'Jove,' he said, 'has laid his hand over the city 
<A NAME="502"></A>to protect it, and the people have taken heart.' This is what he said, 
<A NAME="503"></A>and the others who were with me can tell you the same story- Ajax and the 
<A NAME="504"></A>two heralds, men, both of them, who may be trusted. The old man Phoenix 
<A NAME="505"></A>stayed where he was to sleep, for so Achilles would have it, that he might 
<A NAME="506"></A>go home with him in the morning if he so would; but he will not take him 
<A NAME="507"></A>by force."
<A NAME="508"></A><BR><BR>They all held their peace, sitting for a long time silent and dejected, 
<A NAME="509"></A>by reason of the sternness with which Achilles had refused them, till presently 
<A NAME="510"></A>Diomed said, "Most noble son of Atreus, king of men, Agamemnon, you ought 
<A NAME="511"></A>not to have sued the son of Peleus nor offered him gifts. He is proud enough 
<A NAME="512"></A>as it is, and you have encouraged him in his pride am further. Let him 
<A NAME="513"></A>stay or go as he will. He will fight later when he is in the humour, and 
<A NAME="514"></A>heaven puts it in his mind to do so. Now, therefore, let us all do as I 
<A NAME="515"></A>say; we have eaten and drunk our fill, let us then take our rest, for in 
<A NAME="516"></A>rest there is both strength and stay. But when fair rosy-fingered morn 
<A NAME="517"></A>appears, forthwith bring out your host and your horsemen in front of the 
<A NAME="518"></A>ships, urging them on, and yourself fighting among the 
<A NAME="519"></A>foremost."
<A NAME="520"></A><BR><BR>Thus he spoke, and the other chieftains approved his words. They 
<A NAME="521"></A>then made their drink-offerings and went every man to his own tent, where 
<A NAME="522"></A>they laid down to rest and enjoyed the boon of sleep.
