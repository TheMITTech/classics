<A NAME="10"></A>Thus did he speak, and they all held their peace throughout the covered 
<A NAME="11"></A>cloister, enthralled by the charm of his story, till presently Alcinous 
<A NAME="12"></A>began to speak.
<A NAME="13"></A><BR><BR>"Ulysses," said he, "now that you have reached my house I doubt 
<A NAME="14"></A>not you will get home without further misadventure no matter how much you 
<A NAME="15"></A>have suffered in the past. To you others, however, who come here night 
<A NAME="16"></A>after night to drink my choicest wine and listen to my bard, I would insist 
<A NAME="17"></A>as follows. Our guest has already packed up the clothes, wrought gold, 
<A NAME="18"></A>and other valuables which you have brought for his acceptance; let us now, 
<A NAME="19"></A>therefore, present him further, each one of us, with a large tripod and 
<A NAME="20"></A>a cauldron. We will recoup ourselves by the levy of a general rate; for 
<A NAME="21"></A>private individuals cannot be expected to bear the burden of such a handsome 
<A NAME="22"></A>present."
<A NAME="23"></A><BR><BR>Every one approved of this, and then they went home to bed each 
<A NAME="24"></A>in his own abode. When the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, 
<A NAME="25"></A>they hurried down to the ship and brought their cauldrons with them. Alcinous 
<A NAME="26"></A>went on board and saw everything so securely stowed under the ship's benches 
<A NAME="27"></A>that nothing could break adrift and injure the rowers. Then they went to 
<A NAME="28"></A>the house of Alcinous to get dinner, and he sacrificed a bull for them 
<A NAME="29"></A>in honour of Jove who is the lord of all. They set the steaks to grill 
<A NAME="30"></A>and made an excellent dinner, after which the inspired bard, Demodocus, 
<A NAME="31"></A>who was a favourite with every one, sang to them; but Ulysses kept on turning 
<A NAME="32"></A>his eyes towards the sun, as though to hasten his setting, for he was longing 
<A NAME="33"></A>to be on his way. As one who has been all day ploughing a fallow field 
<A NAME="34"></A>with a couple of oxen keeps thinking about his supper and is glad when 
<A NAME="35"></A>night comes that he may go and get it, for it is all his legs can do to 
<A NAME="36"></A>carry him, even so did Ulysses rejoice when the sun went down, and he at 
<A NAME="37"></A>once said to the Phaecians, addressing himself more particularly to King 
<A NAME="38"></A>Alcinous:
<A NAME="39"></A><BR><BR>"Sir, and all of you, farewell. Make your drink-offerings and send 
<A NAME="40"></A>me on my way rejoicing, for you have fulfilled my heart's desire by giving 
<A NAME="41"></A>me an escort, and making me presents, which heaven grant that I may turn 
<A NAME="42"></A>to good account; may I find my admirable wife living in peace among friends, 
<A NAME="43"></A>and may you whom I leave behind me give satisfaction to your wives and 
<A NAME="44"></A>children; may heaven vouchsafe you every good grace, and may no evil thing 
<A NAME="45"></A>come among your people."
<A NAME="46"></A><BR><BR>Thus did he speak. His hearers all of them approved his saying 
<A NAME="47"></A>and agreed that he should have his escort inasmuch as he had spoken reasonably. 
<A NAME="48"></A>Alcinous therefore said to his servant, "Pontonous, mix some wine and hand 
<A NAME="49"></A>it round to everybody, that we may offer a prayer to father Jove, and speed 
<A NAME="50"></A>our guest upon his way."
<A NAME="51"></A><BR><BR>Pontonous mixed the wine and handed it to every one in turn; the 
<A NAME="52"></A>others each from his own seat made a drink-offering to the blessed gods 
<A NAME="53"></A>that live in heaven, but Ulysses rose and placed the double cup in the 
<A NAME="54"></A>hands of queen Arete.
<A NAME="55"></A><BR><BR>"Farewell, queen," said he, "henceforward and for ever, till age 
<A NAME="56"></A>and death, the common lot of mankind, lay their hands upon you. I now take 
<A NAME="57"></A>my leave; be happy in this house with your children, your people, and with 
<A NAME="58"></A>king Alcinous."
<A NAME="59"></A><BR><BR>As he spoke he crossed the threshold, and Alcinous sent a man to 
<A NAME="60"></A>conduct him to his ship and to the sea shore. Arete also sent some maid 
<A NAME="61"></A>servants with him- one with a clean shirt and cloak, another to carry his 
<A NAME="62"></A>strong-box, and a third with corn and wine. When they got to the water 
<A NAME="63"></A>side the crew took these things and put them on board, with all the meat 
<A NAME="64"></A>and drink; but for Ulysses they spread a rug and a linen sheet on deck 
<A NAME="65"></A>that he might sleep soundly in the stern of the ship. Then he too went 
<A NAME="66"></A>on board and lay down without a word, but the crew took every man his place 
<A NAME="67"></A>and loosed the hawser from the pierced stone to which it had been bound. 
<A NAME="68"></A>Thereon, when they began rowing out to sea, Ulysses fell into a deep, sweet, 
<A NAME="69"></A>and almost deathlike slumber.
<A NAME="70"></A><BR><BR>The ship bounded forward on her way as a four in hand chariot flies 
<A NAME="71"></A>over the course when the horses feel the whip. Her prow curveted as it 
<A NAME="72"></A>were the neck of a stallion, and a great wave of dark blue water seethed 
<A NAME="73"></A>in her wake. She held steadily on her course, and even a falcon, swiftest 
<A NAME="74"></A>of all birds, could not have kept pace with her. Thus, then, she cut her 
<A NAME="75"></A>way through the water. carrying one who was as cunning as the gods, but 
<A NAME="76"></A>who was now sleeping peacefully, forgetful of all that he had suffered 
<A NAME="77"></A>both on the field of battle and by the waves of the weary 
<A NAME="78"></A>sea.
<A NAME="79"></A><BR><BR>When the bright star that heralds the approach of dawn began to 
<A NAME="80"></A>show. the ship drew near to land. Now there is in Ithaca a haven of the 
<A NAME="81"></A>old merman Phorcys, which lies between two points that break the line of 
<A NAME="82"></A>the sea and shut the harbour in. These shelter it from the storms of wind 
<A NAME="83"></A>and sea that rage outside, so that, when once within it, a ship may lie 
<A NAME="84"></A>without being even moored. At the head of this harbour there is a large 
<A NAME="85"></A>olive tree, and at no distance a fine overarching cavern sacred to the 
<A NAME="86"></A>nymphs who are called Naiads. There are mixing-bowls within it and wine-jars 
<A NAME="87"></A>of stone, and the bees hive there. Moreover, there are great looms of stone 
<A NAME="88"></A>on which the nymphs weave their robes of sea purple- very curious to see- 
<A NAME="89"></A>and at all times there is water within it. It has two entrances, one facing 
<A NAME="90"></A>North by which mortals can go down into the cave, while the other comes 
<A NAME="91"></A>from the South and is more mysterious; mortals cannot possibly get in by 
<A NAME="92"></A>it, it is the way taken by the gods.
<A NAME="93"></A><BR><BR>Into this harbour, then, they took their ship, for they knew the 
<A NAME="94"></A>place, She had so much way upon her that she ran half her own length on 
<A NAME="95"></A>to the shore; when, however, they had landed, the first thing they did 
<A NAME="96"></A>was to lift Ulysses with his rug and linen sheet out of the ship, and lay 
<A NAME="97"></A>him down upon the sand still fast asleep. Then they took out the presents 
<A NAME="98"></A>which Minerva had persuaded the Phaeacians to give him when he was setting 
<A NAME="99"></A>out on his voyage homewards. They put these all together by the root of 
<A NAME="100"></A>the olive tree, away from the road, for fear some passer by might come 
<A NAME="101"></A>and steal them before Ulysses awoke; and then they made the best of their 
<A NAME="102"></A>way home again.
<A NAME="103"></A><BR><BR>But Neptune did not forget the threats with which he had already 
<A NAME="104"></A>threatened Ulysses, so he took counsel with Jove. "Father Jove," said he, 
<A NAME="105"></A>"I shall no longer be held in any sort of respect among you gods, if mortals 
<A NAME="106"></A>like the Phaeacians, who are my own flesh and blood, show such small regard 
<A NAME="107"></A>for me. I said I would Ulysses get home when he had suffered sufficiently. 
<A NAME="108"></A>I did not say that he should never get home at all, for I knew you had 
<A NAME="109"></A>already nodded your head about it, and promised that he should do so; but 
<A NAME="110"></A>now they have brought him in a ship fast asleep and have landed him in 
<A NAME="111"></A>Ithaca after loading him with more magnificent presents of bronze, gold, 
<A NAME="112"></A>and raiment than he would ever have brought back from Troy, if he had had 
<A NAME="113"></A>his share of the spoil and got home without misadventure."
<A NAME="114"></A><BR><BR>And Jove answered, "What, O Lord of the Earthquake, are you talking 
<A NAME="115"></A>about? The gods are by no means wanting in respect for you. It would be 
<A NAME="116"></A>monstrous were they to insult one so old and honoured as you are. As regards 
<A NAME="117"></A>mortals, however, if any of them is indulging in insolence and treating 
<A NAME="118"></A>you disrespectfully, it will always rest with yourself to deal with him 
<A NAME="119"></A>as you may think proper, so do just as you please."
<A NAME="120"></A><BR><BR>"I should have done so at once," replied Neptune, "if I were not 
<A NAME="121"></A>anxious to avoid anything that might displease you; now, therefore, I should 
<A NAME="122"></A>like to wreck the Phaecian ship as it is returning from its escort. This 
<A NAME="123"></A>will stop them from escorting people in future; and I should also like 
<A NAME="124"></A>to bury their city under a huge mountain."
<A NAME="125"></A><BR><BR>"My good friend," answered Jove, "I should recommend you at the 
<A NAME="126"></A>very moment when the people from the city are watching the ship on her 
<A NAME="127"></A>way, to turn it into a rock near the land and looking like a ship. This 
<A NAME="128"></A>will astonish everybody, and you can then bury their city under the 
<A NAME="129"></A>mountain."
<A NAME="130"></A><BR><BR>When earth-encircling Neptune heard this he went to Scheria where 
<A NAME="131"></A>the Phaecians live, and stayed there till the ship, which was making rapid 
<A NAME="132"></A>way, had got close-in. Then he went up to it, turned it into stone, and 
<A NAME="133"></A>drove it down with the flat of his hand so as to root it in the ground. 
<A NAME="134"></A>After this he went away.
<A NAME="135"></A><BR><BR>The Phaeacians then began talking among themselves, and one would 
<A NAME="136"></A>turn towards his neighbour, saying, "Bless my heart, who is it that can 
<A NAME="137"></A>have rooted the ship in the sea just as she was getting into port? We could 
<A NAME="138"></A>see the whole of her only moment ago."
<A NAME="139"></A><BR><BR>This was how they talked, but they knew nothing about it; and Alcinous 
<A NAME="140"></A>said, "I remember now the old prophecy of my father. He said that Neptune 
<A NAME="141"></A>would be angry with us for taking every one so safely over the sea, and 
<A NAME="142"></A>would one day wreck a Phaeacian ship as it was returning from an escort, 
<A NAME="143"></A>and bury our city under a high mountain. This was what my old father used 
<A NAME="144"></A>to say, and now it is all coming true. Now therefore let us all do as I 
<A NAME="145"></A>say; in the first place we must leave off giving people escorts when they 
<A NAME="146"></A>come here, and in the next let us sacrifice twelve picked bulls to Neptune 
<A NAME="147"></A>that he may have mercy upon us, and not bury our city under the high mountain." 
<A NAME="148"></A>When the people heard this they were afraid and got ready the 
<A NAME="149"></A>bulls.
<A NAME="150"></A><BR><BR>Thus did the chiefs and rulers of the Phaecians to king Neptune, 
<A NAME="151"></A>standing round his altar; and at the same time Ulysses woke up once more 
<A NAME="152"></A>upon his own soil. He had been so long away that he did not know it again; 
<A NAME="153"></A>moreover, Jove's daughter Minerva had made it a foggy day, so that people 
<A NAME="154"></A>might not know of his having come, and that she might tell him everything 
<A NAME="155"></A>without either his wife or his fellow citizens and friends recognizing 
<A NAME="156"></A>him until he had taken his revenge upon the wicked suitors. Everything, 
<A NAME="157"></A>therefore, seemed quite different to him- the long straight tracks, the 
<A NAME="158"></A>harbours, the precipices, and the goodly trees, appeared all changed as 
<A NAME="159"></A>he started up and looked upon his native land. So he smote his thighs with 
<A NAME="160"></A>the flat of his hands and cried aloud despairingly.
<A NAME="161"></A><BR><BR>"Alas," he exclaimed, "among what manner of people am I fallen? 
<A NAME="162"></A>Are they savage and uncivilized or hospitable and humane? Where shall I 
<A NAME="163"></A>put all this treasure, and which way shall I go? I wish I had stayed over 
<A NAME="164"></A>there with the Phaeacians; or I could have gone to some other great chief 
<A NAME="165"></A>who would have been good to me and given me an escort. As it is I do not 
<A NAME="166"></A>know where to put my treasure, and I cannot leave it here for fear somebody 
<A NAME="167"></A>else should get hold of it. In good truth the chiefs and rulers of the 
<A NAME="168"></A>Phaeacians have not been dealing fairly by me, and have left me in the 
<A NAME="169"></A>wrong country; they said they would take me back to Ithaca and they have 
<A NAME="170"></A>not done so: may Jove the protector of suppliants chastise them, for he 
<A NAME="171"></A>watches over everybody and punishes those who do wrong. Still, I suppose 
<A NAME="172"></A>I must count my goods and see if the crew have gone off with any of 
<A NAME="173"></A>them."
<A NAME="174"></A><BR><BR>He counted his goodly coppers and cauldrons, his gold and all his 
<A NAME="175"></A>clothes, but there was nothing missing; still he kept grieving about not 
<A NAME="176"></A>being in his own country, and wandered up and down by the shore of the 
<A NAME="177"></A>sounding sea bewailing his hard fate. Then Minerva came up to him disguised 
<A NAME="178"></A>as a young shepherd of delicate and princely mien, with a good cloak folded 
<A NAME="179"></A>double about her shoulders; she had sandals on her comely feet and held 
<A NAME="180"></A>a javelin in her hand. Ulysses was glad when he saw her, and went straight 
<A NAME="181"></A>up to her.
<A NAME="182"></A><BR><BR>"My friend," said he, "you are the first person whom I have met 
<A NAME="183"></A>with in this country; I salute you, therefore, and beg you to be will disposed 
<A NAME="184"></A>towards me. Protect these my goods, and myself too, for I embrace your 
<A NAME="185"></A>knees and pray to you as though you were a god. Tell me, then, and tell 
<A NAME="186"></A>me truly, what land and country is this? Who are its inhabitants? Am I 
<A NAME="187"></A>on an island, or is this the sea board of some continent?"
<A NAME="188"></A><BR><BR>Minerva answered, "Stranger, you must be very simple, or must have 
<A NAME="189"></A>come from somewhere a long way off, not to know what country this is. It 
<A NAME="190"></A>is a very celebrated place, and everybody knows it East and West. It is 
<A NAME="191"></A>rugged and not a good driving country, but it is by no means a bid island 
<A NAME="192"></A>for what there is of it. It grows any quantity of corn and also wine, for 
<A NAME="193"></A>it is watered both by rain and dew; it breeds cattle also and goats; all 
<A NAME="194"></A>kinds of timber grow here, and there are watering places where the water 
<A NAME="195"></A>never runs dry; so, sir, the name of Ithaca is known even as far as Troy, 
<A NAME="196"></A>which I understand to be a long way off from this Achaean 
<A NAME="197"></A>country."
<A NAME="198"></A><BR><BR>Ulysses was glad at finding himself, as Minerva told him, in his 
<A NAME="199"></A>own country, and he began to answer, but he did not speak the truth, and 
<A NAME="200"></A>made up a lying story in the instinctive wiliness of his 
<A NAME="201"></A>heart.
<A NAME="202"></A><BR><BR>"I heard of Ithaca," said he, "when I was in Crete beyond the seas, 
<A NAME="203"></A>and now it seems I have reached it with all these treasures. I have left 
<A NAME="204"></A>as much more behind me for my children, but am flying because I killed 
<A NAME="205"></A>Orsilochus son of Idomeneus, the fleetest runner in Crete. I killed him 
<A NAME="206"></A>because he wanted to rob me of the spoils I had got from Troy with so much 
<A NAME="207"></A>trouble and danger both on the field of battle and by the waves of the 
<A NAME="208"></A>weary sea; he said I had not served his father loyally at Troy as vassal, 
<A NAME="209"></A>but had set myself up as an independent ruler, so I lay in wait for him 
<A NAME="210"></A>and with one of my followers by the road side, and speared him as he was 
<A NAME="211"></A>coming into town from the country. my It was a very dark night and nobody 
<A NAME="212"></A>saw us; it was not known, therefore, that I had killed him, but as soon 
<A NAME="213"></A>as I had done so I went to a ship and besought the owners, who were Phoenicians, 
<A NAME="214"></A>to take me on board and set me in Pylos or in Elis where the Epeans rule, 
<A NAME="215"></A>giving them as much spoil as satisfied them. They meant no guile, but the 
<A NAME="216"></A>wind drove them off their course, and we sailed on till we came hither 
<A NAME="217"></A>by night. It was all we could do to get inside the harbour, and none of 
<A NAME="218"></A>us said a word about supper though we wanted it badly, but we all went 
<A NAME="219"></A>on shore and lay down just as we were. I was very tired and fell asleep 
<A NAME="220"></A>directly, so they took my goods out of the ship, and placed them beside 
<A NAME="221"></A>me where I was lying upon the sand. Then they sailed away to Sidonia, and 
<A NAME="222"></A>I was left here in great distress of mind."
<A NAME="223"></A><BR><BR>Such was his story, but Minerva smiled and caressed him with her 
<A NAME="224"></A>hand. Then she took the form of a woman, fair, stately, and wise, "He must 
<A NAME="225"></A>be indeed a shifty lying fellow," said she, "who could surpass you in all 
<A NAME="226"></A>manner of craft even though you had a god for your antagonist. Dare-devil 
<A NAME="227"></A>that you are, full of guile, unwearying in deceit, can you not drop your 
<A NAME="228"></A>tricks and your instinctive falsehood, even now that you are in your own 
<A NAME="229"></A>country again? We will say no more, however, about this, for we can both 
<A NAME="230"></A>of us deceive upon occasion- you are the most accomplished counsellor and 
<A NAME="231"></A>orator among all mankind, while I for diplomacy and subtlety have no equal 
<A NAME="232"></A>among the gods. Did you not know Jove's daughter Minerva- me, who have 
<A NAME="233"></A>been ever with you, who kept watch over you in all your troubles, and who 
<A NAME="234"></A>made the Phaeacians take so great a liking to you? And now, again, I am 
<A NAME="235"></A>come here to talk things over with you, and help you to hide the treasure 
<A NAME="236"></A>I made the Phaeacians give you; I want to tell you about the troubles that 
<A NAME="237"></A>await you in your own house; you have got to face them, but tell no one, 
<A NAME="238"></A>neither man nor woman, that you have come home again. Bear everything, 
<A NAME="239"></A>and put up with every man's insolence, without a word."
<A NAME="240"></A><BR><BR>And Ulysses answered, "A man, goddess, may know a great deal, but 
<A NAME="241"></A>you are so constantly changing your appearance that when he meets you it 
<A NAME="242"></A>is a hard matter for him to know whether it is you or not. This much, however, 
<A NAME="243"></A>I know exceedingly well; you were very kind to me as long as we Achaeans 
<A NAME="244"></A>were fighting before Troy, but from the day on which we went on board ship 
<A NAME="245"></A>after having sacked the city of Priam, and heaven dispersed us- from that 
<A NAME="246"></A>day, Minerva, I saw no more of you, and cannot ever remember your coming 
<A NAME="247"></A>to my ship to help me in a difficulty; I had to wander on sick and sorry 
<A NAME="248"></A>till the gods delivered me from evil and I reached the city of the Phaeacians, 
<A NAME="249"></A>where you encouraged me and took me into the town. And now, I beseech you 
<A NAME="250"></A>in your father's name, tell me the truth, for I do not believe I am really 
<A NAME="251"></A>back in Ithaca. I am in some other country and you are mocking me and deceiving 
<A NAME="252"></A>me in all you have been saying. Tell me then truly, have I really got back 
<A NAME="253"></A>to my own country?"
<A NAME="254"></A><BR><BR>"You are always taking something of that sort into your head," 
<A NAME="255"></A>replied Minerva, "and that is why I cannot desert you in your afflictions; 
<A NAME="256"></A>you are so plausible, shrewd and shifty. Any one but yourself on returning 
<A NAME="257"></A>from so long a voyage would at once have gone home to see his wife and 
<A NAME="258"></A>children, but you do not seem to care about asking after them or hearing 
<A NAME="259"></A>any news about them till you have exploited your wife, who remains at home 
<A NAME="260"></A>vainly grieving for you, and having no peace night or day for the tears 
<A NAME="261"></A>she sheds on your behalf. As for my not coming near you, I was never uneasy 
<A NAME="262"></A>about you, for I was certain you would get back safely though you would 
<A NAME="263"></A>lose all your men, and I did not wish to quarrel with my uncle Neptune, 
<A NAME="264"></A>who never forgave you for having blinded his son. I will now, however, 
<A NAME="265"></A>point out to you the lie of the land, and you will then perhaps believe 
<A NAME="266"></A>me. This is the haven of the old merman Phorcys, and here is the olive 
<A NAME="267"></A>tree that grows at the head of it; [near it is the cave sacred to the Naiads;] 
<A NAME="268"></A>here too is the overarching cavern in which you have offered many an acceptable 
<A NAME="269"></A>hecatomb to the nymphs, and this is the wooded mountain 
<A NAME="270"></A>Neritum."
<A NAME="271"></A><BR><BR>As she spoke the goddess dispersed the mist and the land appeared. 
<A NAME="272"></A>Then Ulysses rejoiced at finding himself again in his own land, and kissed 
<A NAME="273"></A>the bounteous soil; he lifted up his hands and prayed to the nymphs, saying, 
<A NAME="274"></A>"Naiad nymphs, daughters of Jove, I made sure that I was never again to 
<A NAME="275"></A>see you, now therefore I greet you with all loving salutations, and I will 
<A NAME="276"></A>bring you offerings as in the old days, if Jove's redoubtable daughter 
<A NAME="277"></A>will grant me life, and bring my son to manhood."
<A NAME="278"></A><BR><BR>"Take heart, and do not trouble yourself about that," rejoined 
<A NAME="279"></A>Minerva, "let us rather set about stowing your things at once in the cave, 
<A NAME="280"></A>where they will be quite safe. Let us see how we can best manage it 
<A NAME="281"></A>all."
<A NAME="282"></A><BR><BR>Therewith she went down into the cave to look for the safest hiding 
<A NAME="283"></A>places, while Ulysses brought up all the treasure of gold, bronze, and 
<A NAME="284"></A>good clothing which the Phaecians had given him. They stowed everything 
<A NAME="285"></A>carefully away, and Minerva set a stone against the door of the cave. Then 
<A NAME="286"></A>the two sat down by the root of the great olive, and consulted how to compass 
<A NAME="287"></A>the destruction of the wicked suitors.
<A NAME="288"></A><BR><BR>"Ulysses," said Minerva, "noble son of Laertes, think how you can 
<A NAME="289"></A>lay hands on these disreputable people who have been lording it in your 
<A NAME="290"></A>house these three years, courting your wife and making wedding presents 
<A NAME="291"></A>to her, while she does nothing but lament your absence, giving hope and 
<A NAME="292"></A>sending your encouraging messages to every one of them, but meaning the 
<A NAME="293"></A>very opposite of all she says'
<A NAME="294"></A><BR><BR>And Ulysses answered, "In good truth, goddess, it seems I should 
<A NAME="295"></A>have come to much the same bad end in my own house as Agamemnon did, if 
<A NAME="296"></A>you had not given me such timely information. Advise me how I shall best 
<A NAME="297"></A>avenge myself. Stand by my side and put your courage into my heart as on 
<A NAME="298"></A>the day when we loosed Troy's fair diadem from her brow. Help me now as 
<A NAME="299"></A>you did then, and I will fight three hundred men, if you, goddess, will 
<A NAME="300"></A>be with me."
<A NAME="301"></A><BR><BR>"Trust me for that," said she, "I will not lose sight of you when 
<A NAME="302"></A>once we set about it, and I would imagine that some of those who are devouring 
<A NAME="303"></A>your substance will then bespatter the pavement with their blood and brains. 
<A NAME="304"></A>I will begin by disguising you so that no human being shall know you; I 
<A NAME="305"></A>will cover your body with wrinkles; you shall lose all your yellow hair; 
<A NAME="306"></A>I will clothe you in a garment that shall fill all who see it with loathing; 
<A NAME="307"></A>I will blear your fine eyes for you, and make you an unseemly object in 
<A NAME="308"></A>the sight of the suitors, of your wife, and of the son whom you left behind 
<A NAME="309"></A>you. Then go at once to the swineherd who is in charge of your pigs; he 
<A NAME="310"></A>has been always well affected towards you, and is devoted to Penelope and 
<A NAME="311"></A>your son; you will find him feeding his pigs near the rock that is called 
<A NAME="312"></A>Raven by the fountain Arethusa, where they are fattening on beechmast and 
<A NAME="313"></A>spring water after their manner. Stay with him and find out how things 
<A NAME="314"></A>are going, while I proceed to Sparta and see your son, who is with Menelaus 
<A NAME="315"></A>at Lacedaemon, where he has gone to try and find out whether you are still 
<A NAME="316"></A>alive."
<A NAME="317"></A><BR><BR>"But why," said Ulysses, "did you not tell him, for you knew all 
<A NAME="318"></A>about it? Did you want him too to go sailing about amid all kinds of hardship 
<A NAME="319"></A>while others are eating up his estate?"
<A NAME="320"></A><BR><BR>Minerva answered, "Never mind about him, I sent him that he might 
<A NAME="321"></A>be well spoken of for having gone. He is in no sort of difficulty, but 
<A NAME="322"></A>is staying quite comfortably with Menelaus, and is surrounded with abundance 
<A NAME="323"></A>of every kind. The suitors have put out to sea and are lying in wait for 
<A NAME="324"></A>him, for they mean to kill him before he can get home. I do not much think 
<A NAME="325"></A>they will succeed, but rather that some of those who are now eating up 
<A NAME="326"></A>your estate will first find a grave themselves."
<A NAME="327"></A><BR><BR>As she spoke Minerva touched him with her wand and covered him 
<A NAME="328"></A>with wrinkles, took away all his yellow hair, and withered the flesh over 
<A NAME="329"></A>his whole body; she bleared his eyes, which were naturally very fine ones; 
<A NAME="330"></A>she changed his clothes and threw an old rag of a wrap about him, and a 
<A NAME="331"></A>tunic, tattered, filthy, and begrimed with smoke; she also gave him an 
<A NAME="332"></A>undressed deer skin as an outer garment, and furnished him with a staff 
<A NAME="333"></A>and a wallet all in holes, with a twisted thong for him to sling it over 
<A NAME="334"></A>his shoulder.
<A NAME="335"></A><BR><BR>When the pair had thus laid their plans they parted, and the goddess 
<A NAME="336"></A>went straight to Lacedaemon to fetch Telemachus.
