<A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A>Thus then did they fight as it were a flaming fire. Meanwhile the fleet 
<A NAME="11"></A>runner Antilochus, who had been sent as messenger, reached Achilles, and 
<A NAME="12"></A>found him sitting by his tall ships and boding that which was indeed too 
<A NAME="13"></A>surely true. "Alas," said he to himself in the heaviness of his heart, 
<A NAME="14"></A>"why are the Achaeans again scouring the plain and flocking towards the 
<A NAME="15"></A>ships? Heaven grant the gods be not now bringing that sorrow upon me of 
<A NAME="16"></A>which my mother Thetis spoke, saying that while I was yet alive the bravest 
<A NAME="17"></A>of the Myrmidons should fall before the Trojans, and see the light of the 
<A NAME="18"></A>sun no longer. I fear the brave son of Menoetius has fallen through his 
<A NAME="19"></A>own daring and yet I bade him return to the ships as soon as he had driven 
<A NAME="20"></A>back those that were bringing fire against them, and not join battle with 
<A NAME="21"></A>Hector."
<A NAME="22"></A><BR><BR>As he was thus pondering, the son of Nestor came up to him and 
<A NAME="23"></A>told his sad tale, weeping bitterly the while. "Alas," he cried, "son of 
<A NAME="24"></A>noble Peleus, I bring you bad tidings, would indeed that they were untrue. 
<A NAME="25"></A>Patroclus has fallen, and a fight is raging about his naked body- for Hector 
<A NAME="26"></A>holds his armour."
<A NAME="27"></A><BR><BR>A dark cloud of grief fell upon Achilles as he listened. He filled 
<A NAME="28"></A>both hands with dust from off the ground, and poured it over his head, 
<A NAME="29"></A>disfiguring his comely face, and letting the refuse settle over his shirt 
<A NAME="30"></A>so fair and new. He flung himself down all huge and hugely at full length, 
<A NAME="31"></A>and tore his hair with his hands. The bondswomen whom Achilles and Patroclus 
<A NAME="32"></A>had taken captive screamed aloud for grief, beating their breasts, and 
<A NAME="33"></A>with their limbs failing them for sorrow. Antilochus bent over him the 
<A NAME="34"></A>while, weeping and holding both his hands as he lay groaning for he feared 
<A NAME="35"></A>that he might plunge a knife into his own throat. Then Achilles gave a 
<A NAME="36"></A>loud cry and his mother heard him as she was sitting in the depths of the 
<A NAME="37"></A>sea by the old man her father, whereon she screamed, and all the goddesses 
<A NAME="38"></A>daughters of Nereus that dwelt at the bottom of the sea, came gathering 
<A NAME="39"></A>round her. There were Glauce, Thalia and Cymodoce, Nesaia, Speo, thoe and 
<A NAME="40"></A>dark-eyed Halie, Cymothoe, Actaea and Limnorea, Melite, Iaera, Amphithoe 
<A NAME="41"></A>and Agave, Doto and Proto, Pherusa and Dynamene, Dexamene, Amphinome and 
<A NAME="42"></A>Callianeira, Doris, Panope, and the famous sea-nymph Galatea, Nemertes, 
<A NAME="43"></A>Apseudes and Callianassa. There were also Clymene, Ianeira and Ianassa, 
<A NAME="44"></A>Maera, Oreithuia and Amatheia of the lovely locks, with other Nereids who 
<A NAME="45"></A>dwell in the depths of the sea. The crystal cave was filled with their 
<A NAME="46"></A>multitude and they all beat their breasts while Thetis led them in their 
<A NAME="47"></A>lament.
<A NAME="48"></A><BR><BR>"Listen," she cried, "sisters, daughters of Nereus, that you may 
<A NAME="49"></A>hear the burden of my sorrows. Alas, woe is me, woe in that I have borne 
<A NAME="50"></A>the most glorious of offspring. I bore him fair and strong, hero among 
<A NAME="51"></A>heroes, and he shot up as a sapling; I tended him as a plant in a goodly 
<A NAME="52"></A>garden, and sent him with his ships to Ilius to fight the Trojans, but 
<A NAME="53"></A>never shall I welcome him back to the house of Peleus. So long as he lives 
<A NAME="54"></A>to look upon the light of the sun he is in heaviness, and though I go to 
<A NAME="55"></A>him I cannot help him. Nevertheless I will go, that I may see my dear son 
<A NAME="56"></A>and learn what sorrow has befallen him though he is still holding aloof 
<A NAME="57"></A>from battle."
<A NAME="58"></A><BR><BR>She left the cave as she spoke, while the others followed weeping 
<A NAME="59"></A>after, and the waves opened a path before them. When they reached the rich 
<A NAME="60"></A>plain of Troy, they came up out of the sea in a long line on to the sands, 
<A NAME="61"></A>at the place where the ships of the Myrmidons were drawn up in close order 
<A NAME="62"></A>round the tents of Achilles. His mother went up to him as he lay groaning; 
<A NAME="63"></A>she laid her hand upon his head and spoke piteously, saying, "My son, why 
<A NAME="64"></A>are you thus weeping? What sorrow has now befallen you? Tell me; hide it 
<A NAME="65"></A>not from me. Surely Jove has granted you the prayer you made him, when 
<A NAME="66"></A>you lifted up your hands and besought him that the Achaeans might all of 
<A NAME="67"></A>them be pent up at their ships, and rue it bitterly in that you were no 
<A NAME="68"></A>longer with them."
<A NAME="69"></A><BR><BR>Achilles groaned and answered, "Mother, Olympian Jove has indeed 
<A NAME="70"></A>vouchsafed me the fulfilment of my prayer, but what boots it to me, seeing 
<A NAME="71"></A>that my dear comrade Patroclus has fallen- he whom I valued more than all 
<A NAME="72"></A>others, and loved as dearly as my own life? I have lost him; aye, and Hector 
<A NAME="73"></A>when he had killed him stripped the wondrous armour, so glorious to behold, 
<A NAME="74"></A>which the gods gave to Peleus when they laid you in the couch of a mortal 
<A NAME="75"></A>man. Would that you were still dwelling among the immortal sea-nymphs, 
<A NAME="76"></A>and that Peleus had taken to himself some mortal bride. For now you shall 
<A NAME="77"></A>have grief infinite by reason of the death of that son whom you can never 
<A NAME="78"></A>welcome home- nay, I will not live nor go about among mankind unless Hector 
<A NAME="79"></A>fall by my spear, and thus pay me for having slain Patroclus son of 
<A NAME="80"></A>Menoetius."
<A NAME="81"></A><BR><BR>Thetis wept and answered, "Then, my son, is your end near at hand- 
<A NAME="82"></A>for your own death awaits you full soon after that of 
<A NAME="83"></A>Hector."
<A NAME="84"></A><BR><BR>Then said Achilles in his great grief, "I would die here and now, 
<A NAME="85"></A>in that I could not save my comrade. He has fallen far from home, and in 
<A NAME="86"></A>his hour of need my hand was not there to help him. What is there for me? 
<A NAME="87"></A>Return to my own land I shall not, and I have brought no saving neither 
<A NAME="88"></A>to Patroclus nor to my other comrades of whom so many have been slain by 
<A NAME="89"></A>mighty Hector; I stay here by my ships a bootless burden upon the earth, 
<A NAME="90"></A>I, who in fight have no peer among the Achaeans, though in council there 
<A NAME="91"></A>are better than I. Therefore, perish strife both from among gods and men, 
<A NAME="92"></A>and anger, wherein even a righteous man will harden his heart- which rises 
<A NAME="93"></A>up in the soul of a man like smoke, and the taste thereof is sweeter than 
<A NAME="94"></A>drops of honey. Even so has Agamemnon angered me. And yet- so be it, for 
<A NAME="95"></A>it is over; I will force my soul into subjection as I needs must; I will 
<A NAME="96"></A>go; I will pursue Hector who has slain him whom I loved so dearly, and 
<A NAME="97"></A>will then abide my doom when it may please Jove and the other gods to send 
<A NAME="98"></A>it. Even Hercules, the best beloved of Jove- even he could not escape the 
<A NAME="99"></A>hand of death, but fate and Juno's fierce anger laid him low, as I too 
<A NAME="100"></A>shall lie when I am dead if a like doom awaits me. Till then I will win 
<A NAME="101"></A>fame, and will bid Trojan and Dardanian women wring tears from their tender 
<A NAME="102"></A>cheeks with both their hands in the grievousness of their great sorrow; 
<A NAME="103"></A>thus shall they know that he who has held aloof so long will hold aloof 
<A NAME="104"></A>no longer. Hold me not back, therefore, in the love you bear me, for you 
<A NAME="105"></A>shall not move me."
<A NAME="106"></A><BR><BR>Then silver-footed Thetis answered, "My son, what you have said 
<A NAME="107"></A>is true. It is well to save your comrades from destruction, but your armour 
<A NAME="108"></A>is in the hands of the Trojans; Hector bears it in triumph upon his own 
<A NAME="109"></A>shoulders. Full well I know that his vaunt shall not be lasting, for his 
<A NAME="110"></A>end is close at hand; go not, however, into the press of battle till you 
<A NAME="111"></A>see me return hither; to-morrow at break of day I shall be here, and will 
<A NAME="112"></A>bring you goodly armour from King Vulcan."
<A NAME="113"></A><BR><BR>On this she left her brave son, and as she turned away she said 
<A NAME="114"></A>to the sea-nymphs her sisters, "Dive into the bosom of the sea and go to 
<A NAME="115"></A>the house of the old sea-god my father. Tell him everything; as for me, 
<A NAME="116"></A>I will go to the cunning workman Vulcan on high Olympus, and ask him to 
<A NAME="117"></A>provide my son with a suit of splendid armour."
<A NAME="118"></A><BR><BR>When she had so said, they dived forthwith beneath the waves, while 
<A NAME="119"></A>silver-footed Thetis went her way that she might bring the armour for her 
<A NAME="120"></A>son.
<A NAME="121"></A><BR><BR>Thus, then, did her feet bear the goddess to Olympus, and meanwhile 
<A NAME="122"></A>the Achaeans were flying with loud cries before murderous Hector till they 
<A NAME="123"></A>reached the ships and the Hellespont, and they could not draw the body 
<A NAME="124"></A>of Mars's servant Patroclus out of reach of the weapons that were showered 
<A NAME="125"></A>upon him, for Hector son of Priam with his host and horsemen had again 
<A NAME="126"></A>caught up to him like the flame of a fiery furnace; thrice did brave Hector 
<A NAME="127"></A>seize him by the feet, striving with might and main to draw him away and 
<A NAME="128"></A>calling loudly on the Trojans, and thrice did the two Ajaxes, clothed in 
<A NAME="129"></A>valour as with a garment, beat him from off the body; but all undaunted 
<A NAME="130"></A>he would now charge into the thick of the fight, and now again he would 
<A NAME="131"></A>stand still and cry aloud, but he would give no ground. As upland shepherds 
<A NAME="132"></A>that cannot chase some famished lion from a carcase, even so could not 
<A NAME="133"></A>the two Ajaxes scare Hector son of Priam from the body of 
<A NAME="134"></A>Patroclus.
<A NAME="135"></A><BR><BR>And now he would even have dragged it off and have won imperishable 
<A NAME="136"></A>glory, had not Iris fleet as the wind, winged her way as messenger from 
<A NAME="137"></A>Olympus to the son of Peleus and bidden him arm. She came secretly without 
<A NAME="138"></A>the knowledge of Jove and of the other gods, for Juno sent her, and when 
<A NAME="139"></A>she had got close to him she said, "Up, son of Peleus, mightiest of all 
<A NAME="140"></A>mankind; rescue Patroclus about whom this fearful fight is now raging by 
<A NAME="141"></A>the ships. Men are killing one another, the Danaans in defence of the dead 
<A NAME="142"></A>body, while the Trojans are trying to hale it away, and take it to wind 
<A NAME="143"></A>Ilius: Hector is the most furious of them all; he is for cutting the head 
<A NAME="144"></A>from the body and fixing it on the stakes of the wall. Up, then, and bide 
<A NAME="145"></A>here no longer; shrink from the thought that Patroclus may become meat 
<A NAME="146"></A>for the dogs of Troy. Shame on you, should his body suffer any kind of 
<A NAME="147"></A>outrage."
<A NAME="148"></A><BR><BR>And Achilles said, "Iris, which of the gods was it that sent you 
<A NAME="149"></A>to me?"
<A NAME="150"></A><BR><BR>Iris answered, "It was Juno the royal spouse of Jove, but the son 
<A NAME="151"></A>of Saturn does not know of my coming, nor yet does any other of the immortals 
<A NAME="152"></A>who dwell on the snowy summits of Olympus."
<A NAME="153"></A><BR><BR>Then fleet Achilles answered her saying, "How can I go up into 
<A NAME="154"></A>the battle? They have my armour. My mother forbade me to arm till I should 
<A NAME="155"></A>see her come, for she promised to bring me goodly armour from Vulcan; I 
<A NAME="156"></A>know no man whose arms I can put on, save only the shield of Ajax son of 
<A NAME="157"></A>Telamon, and he surely must be fighting in the front rank and wielding 
<A NAME="158"></A>his spear about the body of dead Patroclus."
<A NAME="159"></A><BR><BR>Iris said, 'We know that your armour has been taken, but go as 
<A NAME="160"></A>you are; go to the deep trench and show yourelf before the Trojans, that 
<A NAME="161"></A>they may fear you and cease fighting. Thus will the fainting sons of the 
<A NAME="162"></A>Achaeans gain some brief breathing-time, which in battle may hardly 
<A NAME="163"></A>be."
<A NAME="164"></A><BR><BR>Iris left him when she had so spoken. But Achilles dear to Jove 
<A NAME="165"></A>arose, and Minerva flung her tasselled aegis round his strong shoulders; 
<A NAME="166"></A>she crowned his head with a halo of golden cloud from which she kindled 
<A NAME="167"></A>a glow of gleaming fire. As the smoke that goes up into heaven from some 
<A NAME="168"></A>city that is being beleaguered on an island far out at sea- all day long 
<A NAME="169"></A>do men sally from the city and fight their hardest, and at the going down 
<A NAME="170"></A>of the sun the line of beacon-fires blazes forth, flaring high for those 
<A NAME="171"></A>that dwell near them to behold, if so be that they may come with their 
<A NAME="172"></A>ships and succour them- even so did the light flare from the head of Achilles, 
<A NAME="173"></A>as he stood by the trench, going beyond the wall- but he aid not join the 
<A NAME="174"></A>Achaeans for he heeded the charge which his mother laid upon 
<A NAME="175"></A>him.
<A NAME="176"></A><BR><BR>There did he stand and shout aloud. Minerva also raised her voice 
<A NAME="177"></A>from afar, and spread terror unspeakable among the Trojans. Ringing as 
<A NAME="178"></A>the note of a trumpet that sounds alarm then the foe is at the gates of 
<A NAME="179"></A>a city, even so brazen was the voice of the son of Aeacus, and when the 
<A NAME="180"></A>Trojans heard its clarion tones they were dismayed; the horses turned back 
<A NAME="181"></A>with their chariots for they boded mischief, and their drivers were awe-struck 
<A NAME="182"></A>by the steady flame which the grey-eyed goddess had kindled above the head 
<A NAME="183"></A>of the great son of Peleus.
<A NAME="184"></A><BR><BR>Thrice did Achilles raise his loud cry as he stood by the trench, 
<A NAME="185"></A>and thrice were the Trojans and their brave allies thrown into confusion; 
<A NAME="186"></A>whereon twelve of their noblest champions fell beneath the wheels of their 
<A NAME="187"></A>chariots and perished by their own spears. The Achaeans to their great 
<A NAME="188"></A>joy then drew Patroclus out of reach of the weapons, and laid him on a 
<A NAME="189"></A>litter: his comrades stood mourning round him, and among them fleet Achilles 
<A NAME="190"></A>who wept bitterly as he saw his true comrade lying dead upon his bier. 
<A NAME="191"></A>He had sent him out with horses and chariots into battle, but his return 
<A NAME="192"></A>he was not to welcome.
<A NAME="193"></A><BR><BR>Then Juno sent the busy sun, loth though he was, into the waters 
<A NAME="194"></A>of Oceanus; so he set, and the Achaeans had rest from the tug and turmoil 
<A NAME="195"></A>of war.
<A NAME="196"></A><BR><BR>Now the Trojans when they had come out of the fight, unyoked their 
<A NAME="197"></A>horses and gathered in assembly before preparing their supper. They kept 
<A NAME="198"></A>their feet, nor would any dare to sit down, for fear had fallen upon them 
<A NAME="199"></A>all because Achilles had shown himself after having held aloof so long 
<A NAME="200"></A>from battle. Polydamas son of Panthous was first to speak, a man of judgement, 
<A NAME="201"></A>who alone among them could look both before and after. He was comrade to 
<A NAME="202"></A>Hector, and they had been born upon the same night; with all sincerity 
<A NAME="203"></A>and goodwill, therefore, he addressed them thus:-
<A NAME="204"></A><BR><BR>"Look to it well, my friends; I would urge you to go back now to 
<A NAME="205"></A>your city and not wait here by the ships till morning, for we are far from 
<A NAME="206"></A>our walls. So long as this man was at enmity with Agamemnon the Achaeans 
<A NAME="207"></A>were easier to deal with, and I would have gladly camped by the ships in 
<A NAME="208"></A>the hope of taking them; but now I go in great fear of the fleet son of 
<A NAME="209"></A>Peleus; he is so daring that he will never bide here on the plain whereon 
<A NAME="210"></A>the Trojans and Achaeans fight with equal valour, but he will try to storm 
<A NAME="211"></A>our city and carry off our women. Do then as I say, and let us retreat. 
<A NAME="212"></A>For this is what will happen. The darkness of night will for a time stay 
<A NAME="213"></A>the son of Peleus, but if he find us here in the morning when he sallies 
<A NAME="214"></A>forth in full armour, we shall have knowledge of him in good earnest. Glad 
<A NAME="215"></A>indeed will he be who can escape and get back to Ilius, and many a Trojan 
<A NAME="216"></A>will become meat for dogs and vultures may I never live to hear it. If 
<A NAME="217"></A>we do as I say, little though we may like it, we shall have strength in 
<A NAME="218"></A>counsel during the night, and the great gates with the doors that close 
<A NAME="219"></A>them will protect the city. At dawn we can arm and take our stand on the 
<A NAME="220"></A>walls; he will then rue it if he sallies from the ships to fight us. He 
<A NAME="221"></A>will go back when he has given his horses their fill of being driven all 
<A NAME="222"></A>whithers under our walls, and will be in no mind to try and force his way 
<A NAME="223"></A>into the city. Neither will he ever sack it, dogs shall devour him ere 
<A NAME="224"></A>he do so."
<A NAME="225"></A><BR><BR>Hector looked fiercely at him and answered, "Polydamas, your words 
<A NAME="226"></A>are not to my liking in that you bid us go back and be pent within the 
<A NAME="227"></A>city. Have you not had enough of being cooped up behind walls? In the old-days 
<A NAME="228"></A>the city of Priam was famous the whole world over for its wealth of gold 
<A NAME="229"></A>and bronze, but our treasures are wasted out of our houses, and much goods 
<A NAME="230"></A>have been sold away to Phrygia and fair Meonia, for the hand of Jove has 
<A NAME="231"></A>been laid heavily upon us. Now, therefore, that the son of scheming Saturn 
<A NAME="232"></A>has vouchsafed me to win glory here and to hem the Achaeans in at their 
<A NAME="233"></A>ships, prate no more in this fool's wise among the people. You will have 
<A NAME="234"></A>no man with you; it shall not be; do all of you as I now say;- take your 
<A NAME="235"></A>suppers in your companies throughout the host, and keep your watches and 
<A NAME="236"></A>be wakeful every man of you. If any Trojan is uneasy about his possessions, 
<A NAME="237"></A>let him gather them and give them out among the people. Better let these, 
<A NAME="238"></A>rather than the Achaeans, have them. At daybreak we will arm and fight 
<A NAME="239"></A>about the ships; granted that Achilles has again come forward to defend 
<A NAME="240"></A>them, let it be as he will, but it shall go hard with him. I shall not 
<A NAME="241"></A>shun him, but will fight him, to fall or conquer. The god of war deals 
<A NAME="242"></A>out like measure to all, and the slayer may yet be slain."
<A NAME="243"></A><BR><BR>Thus spoke Hector; and the Trojans, fools that they were, shouted 
<A NAME="244"></A>in applause, for Pallas Minerva had robbed them of their understanding. 
<A NAME="245"></A>They gave ear to Hector with his evil counsel, but the wise words of Polydamas 
<A NAME="246"></A>no man would heed. They took their supper throughout the host, and meanwhile 
<A NAME="247"></A>through the whole night the Achaeans mourned Patroclus, and the son of 
<A NAME="248"></A>Peleus led them in their lament. He laid his murderous hands upon the breast 
<A NAME="249"></A>of his comrade, groaning again and again as a bearded lion when a man who 
<A NAME="250"></A>was chasing deer has robbed him of his young in some dense forest; when 
<A NAME="251"></A>the lion comes back he is furious, and searches dingle and dell to track 
<A NAME="252"></A>the hunter if he can find him, for he is mad with rage- even so with many 
<A NAME="253"></A>a sigh did Achilles speak among the Myrmidons saying, "Alas! vain were 
<A NAME="254"></A>the words with which I cheered the hero Menoetius in his own house; I said 
<A NAME="255"></A>that I would bring his brave son back again to Opoeis after he had sacked 
<A NAME="256"></A>Ilius and taken his share of the spoils- but Jove does not give all men 
<A NAME="257"></A>their heart's desire. The same soil shall be reddened here at Troy by the 
<A NAME="258"></A>blood of us both, for I too shall never be welcomed home by the old knight 
<A NAME="259"></A>Peleus, nor by my mother Thetis, but even in this place shall the earth 
<A NAME="260"></A>cover me. Nevertheless, O Patroclus, now that I am left behind you, I will 
<A NAME="261"></A>not bury you, till I have brought hither the head and armour of mighty 
<A NAME="262"></A>Hector who has slain you. Twelve noble sons of Trojans will I behead before 
<A NAME="263"></A>your bier to avenge you; till I have done so you shall lie as you are by 
<A NAME="264"></A>the ships, and fair women of Troy and Dardanus, whom we have taken with 
<A NAME="265"></A>spear and strength of arm when we sacked men's goodly cities, shall weep 
<A NAME="266"></A>over you both night and day."
<A NAME="267"></A><BR><BR>Then Achilles told his men to set a large tripod upon the fire 
<A NAME="268"></A>that they might wash the clotted gore from off Patroclus. Thereon they 
<A NAME="269"></A>set a tripod full of bath water on to a clear fire: they threw sticks on 
<A NAME="270"></A>to it to make it blaze, and the water became hot as the flame played about 
<A NAME="271"></A>the belly of the tripod. When the water in the cauldron was boiling they 
<A NAME="272"></A>washed the body, anointed it with oil, and closed its wounds with ointment 
<A NAME="273"></A>that had been kept nine years. Then they laid it on a bier and covered 
<A NAME="274"></A>it with a linen cloth from head to foot, and over this they laid a fair 
<A NAME="275"></A>white robe. Thus all night long did the Myrmidons gather round Achilles 
<A NAME="276"></A>to mourn Patroclus.
<A NAME="277"></A><BR><BR>Then Jove said to Juno his sister-wife, "So, Queen Juno, you have 
<A NAME="278"></A>gained your end, and have roused fleet Achilles. One would think that the 
<A NAME="279"></A>Achaeans were of your own flesh and blood."
<A NAME="280"></A><BR><BR>And Juno answered, "Dread son of Saturn, why should you say this 
<A NAME="281"></A>thing? May not a man though he be only mortal and knows less than we do, 
<A NAME="282"></A>do what he can for another person? And shall not I- foremost of all goddesses 
<A NAME="283"></A>both by descent and as wife to you who reign in heaven- devise evil for 
<A NAME="284"></A>the Trojans if I am angry with them?"
<A NAME="285"></A><BR><BR>Thus did they converse. Meanwhile Thetis came to the house of Vulcan, 
<A NAME="286"></A>imperishable, star-bespangled, fairest of the abodes in heaven, a house 
<A NAME="287"></A>of bronze wrought by the lame god's own hands. She found him busy with 
<A NAME="288"></A>his bellows, sweating and hard at work, for he was making twenty tripods 
<A NAME="289"></A>that were to stand by the wall of his house, and he set wheels of gold 
<A NAME="290"></A>under them all that they might go of their own selves to the assemblies 
<A NAME="291"></A>of the gods, and come back again- marvels indeed to see. They were finished 
<A NAME="292"></A>all but the ears of cunning workmanship which yet remained to be fixed 
<A NAME="293"></A>to them: these he was now fixing, and he was hammering at the rivets. While 
<A NAME="294"></A>he was thus at work silver-footed Thetis came to the house. Charis, of 
<A NAME="295"></A>graceful head-dress, wife to the far-famed lame god, came towards her as 
<A NAME="296"></A>soon as she saw her, and took her hand in her own, saying, "Why have you 
<A NAME="297"></A>come to our house, Thetis, honoured and ever welcome- for you do not visit 
<A NAME="298"></A>us often? Come inside and let me set refreshment before 
<A NAME="299"></A>you."
<A NAME="300"></A><BR><BR>The goddess led the way as she spoke, and bade Thetis sit on a 
<A NAME="301"></A>richly decorated seat inlaid with silver; there was a footstool also under 
<A NAME="302"></A>her feet. Then she called Vulcan and said, "Vulcan, come here, Thetis wants 
<A NAME="303"></A>you"; and the far-famed lame god answered, "Then it is indeed an august 
<A NAME="304"></A>and honoured goddess who has come here; she it was that took care of me 
<A NAME="305"></A>when I was suffering from the heavy fall which I had through my cruel mother's 
<A NAME="306"></A>anger- for she would have got rid of me because I was lame. It would have 
<A NAME="307"></A>gone hardly with me had not Eurynome, daughter of the ever-encircling waters 
<A NAME="308"></A>of Oceanus, and Thetis, taken me to their bosom. Nine years did I stay 
<A NAME="309"></A>with them, and many beautiful works in bronze, brooches, spiral armlets, 
<A NAME="310"></A>cups, and chains, did I make for them in their cave, with the roaring waters 
<A NAME="311"></A>of Oceanus foaming as they rushed ever past it; and no one knew, neither 
<A NAME="312"></A>of gods nor men, save only Thetis and Eurynome who took care of me. If, 
<A NAME="313"></A>then, Thetis has come to my house I must make her due requital for having 
<A NAME="314"></A>saved me; entertain her, therefore, with all hospitality, while I put by 
<A NAME="315"></A>my bellows and all my tools."
<A NAME="316"></A><BR><BR>On this the mighty monster hobbled off from his anvil, his thin 
<A NAME="317"></A>legs plying lustily under him. He set the bellows away from the fire, and 
<A NAME="318"></A>gathered his tools into a silver chest. Then he took a sponge and washed 
<A NAME="319"></A>his face and hands, his shaggy chest and brawny neck; he donned his shirt, 
<A NAME="320"></A>grasped his strong staff, and limped towards the door. There were golden 
<A NAME="321"></A>handmaids also who worked for him, and were like real young women, with 
<A NAME="322"></A>sense and reason, voice also and strength, and all the learning of the 
<A NAME="323"></A>immortals; these busied themselves as the king bade them, while he drew 
<A NAME="324"></A>near to Thetis, seated her upon a goodly seat, and took her hand in his 
<A NAME="325"></A>own, saying, "Why have you come to our house, Thetis honoured and ever 
<A NAME="326"></A>welcome- for you do not visit us often? Say what you want, and I will do 
<A NAME="327"></A>it for you at once if I can, and if it can be done at 
<A NAME="328"></A>all."
<A NAME="329"></A><BR><BR>Thetis wept and answered, "Vulcan, is there another goddess in 
<A NAME="330"></A>Olympus whom the son of Saturn has been pleased to try with so much affliction 
<A NAME="331"></A>as he has me? Me alone of the marine goddesses did he make subject to a 
<A NAME="332"></A>mortal husband, Peleus son of Aeacus, and sorely against my will did I 
<A NAME="333"></A>submit to the embraces of one who was but mortal, and who now stays at 
<A NAME="334"></A>home worn out with age. Neither is this all. Heaven vouchsafed me a son, 
<A NAME="335"></A>hero among heroes, and he shot up as a sapling. I tended him as a plant 
<A NAME="336"></A>in a goodly garden and sent him with his ships to Ilius to fight the Trojans, 
<A NAME="337"></A>but never shall I welcome him back to the house of Peleus. So long as he 
<A NAME="338"></A>lives to look upon the light of the sun, he is in heaviness, and though 
<A NAME="339"></A>I go to him I cannot help him; King Agamemnon has made him give up the 
<A NAME="340"></A>maiden whom the sons of the Achaeans had awarded him, and he wastes with 
<A NAME="341"></A>sorrow for her sake. Then the Trojans hemmed the Achaeans in at their ships' 
<A NAME="342"></A>sterns and would not let them come forth; the elders, therefore, of the 
<A NAME="343"></A>Argives besought Achilles and offered him great treasure, whereon he refused 
<A NAME="344"></A>to bring deliverance to them himself, but put his own armour on Patroclus 
<A NAME="345"></A>and sent him into the fight with much people after him. All day long they 
<A NAME="346"></A>fought by the Scaean gates and would have taken the city there and then, 
<A NAME="347"></A>had not Apollo vouchsafed glory to Hector and slain the valiant son of 
<A NAME="348"></A>Menoetius after he had done the Trojans much evil. Therefore I am suppliant 
<A NAME="349"></A>at your knees if haply you may be pleased to provide my son, whose end 
<A NAME="350"></A>is near at hand, with helmet and shield, with goodly greaves fitted with 
<A NAME="351"></A>ancle-clasps, and with a breastplate, for he lost his own when his true 
<A NAME="352"></A>comrade fell at the hands of the Trojans, and he now lies stretched on 
<A NAME="353"></A>earth in the bitterness of his soul."
<A NAME="354"></A><BR><BR>And Vulcan answered, "Take heart, and be no more disquieted about 
<A NAME="355"></A>this matter; would that I could hide him from death's sight when his hour 
<A NAME="356"></A>is come, so surely as I can find him armour that shall amaze the eyes of 
<A NAME="357"></A>all who behold it."
<A NAME="358"></A><BR><BR>When he had so said he left her and went to his bellows, turning 
<A NAME="359"></A>them towards the fire and bidding them do their office. Twenty bellows 
<A NAME="360"></A>blew upon the melting-pots, and they blew blasts of every kind, some fierce 
<A NAME="361"></A>to help him when he had need of them, and others less strong as Vulcan 
<A NAME="362"></A>willed it in the course of his work. He threw tough copper into the fire, 
<A NAME="363"></A>and tin, with silver and gold; he set his great anvil on its block, and 
<A NAME="364"></A>with one hand grasped his mighty hammer while he took the tongs in the 
<A NAME="365"></A>other.
<A NAME="366"></A><BR><BR>First he shaped the shield so great and strong, adorning it all 
<A NAME="367"></A>over and binding it round with a gleaming circuit in three layers; and 
<A NAME="368"></A>the baldric was made of silver. He made the shield in five thicknesses, 
<A NAME="369"></A>and with many a wonder did his cunning hand enrich it.
<A NAME="370"></A><BR><BR>He wrought the earth, the heavens, and the sea; the moon also at 
<A NAME="371"></A>her full and the untiring sun, with all the signs that glorify the face 
<A NAME="372"></A>of heaven- the Pleiads, the Hyads, huge Orion, and the Bear, which men 
<A NAME="373"></A>also call the Wain and which turns round ever in one place, facing. Orion, 
<A NAME="374"></A>and alone never dips into the stream of Oceanus.
<A NAME="375"></A><BR><BR>He wrought also two cities, fair to see and busy with the hum of 
<A NAME="376"></A>men. In the one were weddings and wedding-feasts, and they were going about 
<A NAME="377"></A>the city with brides whom they were escorting by torchlight from their 
<A NAME="378"></A>chambers. Loud rose the cry of Hymen, and the youths danced to the music 
<A NAME="379"></A>of flute and lyre, while the women stood each at her house door to see 
<A NAME="380"></A>them.
<A NAME="381"></A><BR><BR>Meanwhile the people were gathered in assembly, for there was a 
<A NAME="382"></A>quarrel, and two men were wrangling about the blood-money for a man who 
<A NAME="383"></A>had been killed, the one saying before the people that he had paid damages 
<A NAME="384"></A>in full, and the other that he had not been paid. Each was trying to make 
<A NAME="385"></A>his own case good, and the people took sides, each man backing the side 
<A NAME="386"></A>that he had taken; but the heralds kept them back, and the elders sate 
<A NAME="387"></A>on their seats of stone in a solemn circle, holding the staves which the 
<A NAME="388"></A>heralds had put into their hands. Then they rose and each in his turn gave 
<A NAME="389"></A>judgement, and there were two talents laid down, to be given to him whose 
<A NAME="390"></A>judgement should be deemed the fairest.
<A NAME="391"></A><BR><BR>About the other city there lay encamped two hosts in gleaming armour, 
<A NAME="392"></A>and they were divided whether to sack it, or to spare it and accept the 
<A NAME="393"></A>half of what it contained. But the men of the city would not yet consent, 
<A NAME="394"></A>and armed themselves for a surprise; their wives and little children kept 
<A NAME="395"></A>guard upon the walls, and with them were the men who were past fighting 
<A NAME="396"></A>through age; but the others sallied forth with Mars and Pallas Minerva 
<A NAME="397"></A>at their head- both of them wrought in gold and clad in golden raiment, 
<A NAME="398"></A>great and fair with their armour as befitting gods, while they that followed 
<A NAME="399"></A>were smaller. When they reached the place where they would lay their ambush, 
<A NAME="400"></A>it was on a riverbed to which live stock of all kinds would come from far 
<A NAME="401"></A>and near to water; here, then, they lay concealed, clad in full armour. 
<A NAME="402"></A>Some way off them there were two scouts who were on the look-out for the 
<A NAME="403"></A>coming of sheep or cattle, which presently came, followed by two shepherds 
<A NAME="404"></A>who were playing on their pipes, and had not so much as a thought of danger. 
<A NAME="405"></A>When those who were in ambush saw this, they cut off the flocks and herds 
<A NAME="406"></A>and killed the shepherds. Meanwhile the besiegers, when they heard much 
<A NAME="407"></A>noise among the cattle as they sat in council, sprang to their horses, 
<A NAME="408"></A>and made with all speed towards them; when they reached them they set battle 
<A NAME="409"></A>in array by the banks of the river, and the hosts aimed their bronze-shod 
<A NAME="410"></A>spears at one another. With them were Strife and Riot, and fell Fate who 
<A NAME="411"></A>was dragging three men after her, one with a fresh wound, and the other 
<A NAME="412"></A>unwounded, while the third was dead, and she was dragging him along by 
<A NAME="413"></A>his heel: and her robe was bedrabbled in men's blood. They went in and 
<A NAME="414"></A>out with one another and fought as though they were living people haling 
<A NAME="415"></A>away one another's dead.
<A NAME="416"></A><BR><BR>He wrought also a fair fallow field, large and thrice ploughed 
<A NAME="417"></A>already. Many men were working at the plough within it, turning their oxen 
<A NAME="418"></A>to and fro, furrow after furrow. Each time that they turned on reaching 
<A NAME="419"></A>the headland a man would come up to them and give them a cup of wine, and 
<A NAME="420"></A>they would go back to their furrows looking forward to the time when they 
<A NAME="421"></A>should again reach the headland. The part that they had ploughed was dark 
<A NAME="422"></A>behind them, so that the field, though it was of gold, still looked as 
<A NAME="423"></A>if it were being ploughed- very curious to behold.
<A NAME="424"></A><BR><BR>He wrought also a field of harvest corn, and the reapers were reaping 
<A NAME="425"></A>with sharp sickles in their hands. Swathe after swathe fell to the ground 
<A NAME="426"></A>in a straight line behind them, and the binders bound them in bands of 
<A NAME="427"></A>twisted straw. There were three binders, and behind them there were boys 
<A NAME="428"></A>who gathered the cut corn in armfuls and kept on bringing them to be bound: 
<A NAME="429"></A>among them all the owner of the land stood by in silence and was glad. 
<A NAME="430"></A>The servants were getting a meal ready under an oak, for they had sacrificed 
<A NAME="431"></A>a great ox, and were busy cutting him up, while the women were making a 
<A NAME="432"></A>porridge of much white barley for the labourers' dinner.
<A NAME="433"></A><BR><BR>He wrought also a vineyard, golden and fair to see, and the vines 
<A NAME="434"></A>were loaded with grapes. The bunches overhead were black, but the vines 
<A NAME="435"></A>were trained on poles of silver. He ran a ditch of dark metal all round 
<A NAME="436"></A>it, and fenced it with a fence of tin; there was only one path to it, and 
<A NAME="437"></A>by this the vintagers went when they would gather the vintage. Youths and 
<A NAME="438"></A>maidens all blithe and full of glee, carried the luscious fruit in plaited 
<A NAME="439"></A>baskets; and with them there went a boy who made sweet music with his lyre, 
<A NAME="440"></A>and sang the Linus-song with his clear boyish voice.
<A NAME="441"></A><BR><BR>He wrought also a herd of homed cattle. He made the cows of gold 
<A NAME="442"></A>and tin, and they lowed as they came full speed out of the yards to go 
<A NAME="443"></A>and feed among the waving reeds that grow by the banks of the river. Along 
<A NAME="444"></A>with the cattle there went four shepherds, all of them in gold, and their 
<A NAME="445"></A>nine fleet dogs went with them. Two terrible lions had fastened on a bellowing 
<A NAME="446"></A>bull that was with the foremost cows, and bellow as he might they haled 
<A NAME="447"></A>him, while the dogs and men gave chase: the lions tore through the bull's 
<A NAME="448"></A>thick hide and were gorging on his blood and bowels, but the herdsmen were 
<A NAME="449"></A>afraid to do anything, and only hounded on their dogs; the dogs dared not 
<A NAME="450"></A>fasten on the lions but stood by barking and keeping out of harm's 
<A NAME="451"></A>way.
<A NAME="452"></A><BR><BR>The god wrought also a pasture in a fair mountain dell, and large 
<A NAME="453"></A>flock of sheep, with a homestead and huts, and sheltered 
<A NAME="454"></A>sheepfolds.
<A NAME="455"></A><BR><BR>Furthermore he wrought a green, like that which Daedalus once made 
<A NAME="456"></A>in Cnossus for lovely Ariadne. Hereon there danced youths and maidens whom 
<A NAME="457"></A>all would woo, with their hands on one another's wrists. The maidens wore 
<A NAME="458"></A>robes of light linen, and the youths well woven shirts that were slightly 
<A NAME="459"></A>oiled. The girls were crowned with garlands, while the young men had daggers 
<A NAME="460"></A>of gold that hung by silver baldrics; sometimes they would dance deftly 
<A NAME="461"></A>in a ring with merry twinkling feet, as it were a potter sitting at his 
<A NAME="462"></A>work and making trial of his wheel to see whether it will run, and sometimes 
<A NAME="463"></A>they would go all in line with one another, and much people was gathered 
<A NAME="464"></A>joyously about the green. There was a bard also to sing to them and play 
<A NAME="465"></A>his lyre, while two tumblers went about performing in the midst of them 
<A NAME="466"></A>when the man struck up with his tune.
<A NAME="467"></A><BR><BR>All round the outermost rim of the shield he set the mighty stream 
<A NAME="468"></A>of the river Oceanus.
<A NAME="469"></A><BR><BR>Then when he had fashioned the shield so great and strong, he made 
<A NAME="470"></A>a breastplate also that shone brighter than fire. He made helmet, close 
<A NAME="471"></A>fitting to the brow, and richly worked, with a golden plume overhanging 
<A NAME="472"></A>it; and he made greaves also of beaten tin.
<A NAME="473"></A><BR><BR>Lastly, when the famed lame god had made all the armour, he took 
<A NAME="474"></A>it and set it before the mother of Achilles; whereon she darted like a 
<A NAME="475"></A>falcon from the snowy summits of Olympus and bore away the gleaming armour 
<A NAME="476"></A>from the house of Vulcan.
