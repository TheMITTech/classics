<A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A>So the son of Menoetius was attending to the hurt of Eurypylus within the 
<A NAME="11"></A>tent, but the Argives and Trojans still fought desperately, nor were the 
<A NAME="12"></A>trench and the high wall above it, to keep the Trojans in check longer. 
<A NAME="13"></A>They had built it to protect their ships, and had dug the trench all round 
<A NAME="14"></A>it that it might safeguard both the ships and the rich spoils which they 
<A NAME="15"></A>had taken, but they had not offered hecatombs to the gods. It had been 
<A NAME="16"></A>built without the consent of the immortals, and therefore it did not last. 
<A NAME="17"></A>So long as Hector lived and Achilles nursed his anger, and so long as the 
<A NAME="18"></A>city of Priam remained untaken, the great wall of the Achaeans stood firm; 
<A NAME="19"></A>but when the bravest of the Trojans were no more, and many also of the 
<A NAME="20"></A>Argives, though some were yet left alive when, moreover, the city was sacked 
<A NAME="21"></A>in the tenth year, and the Argives had gone back with their ships to their 
<A NAME="22"></A>own country- then Neptune and Apollo took counsel to destroy the wall, 
<A NAME="23"></A>and they turned on to it the streams of all the rivers from Mount Ida into 
<A NAME="24"></A>the sea, Rhesus, Heptaporus, Caresus, Rhodius, Grenicus, Aesopus, and goodly 
<A NAME="25"></A>Scamander, with Simois, where many a shield and helm had fallen, and many 
<A NAME="26"></A>a hero of the race of demigods had bitten the dust. Phoebus Apollo turned 
<A NAME="27"></A>the mouths of all these rivers together and made them flow for nine days 
<A NAME="28"></A>against the wall, while Jove rained the whole time that he might wash it 
<A NAME="29"></A>sooner into the sea. Neptune himself, trident in hand, surveyed the work 
<A NAME="30"></A>and threw into the sea all the foundations of beams and stones which the 
<A NAME="31"></A>Achaeans had laid with so much toil; he made all level by the mighty stream 
<A NAME="32"></A>of the Hellespont, and then when he had swept the wall away he spread a 
<A NAME="33"></A>great beach of sand over the place where it had been. This done he turned 
<A NAME="34"></A>the rivers back into their old courses.
<A NAME="35"></A><BR><BR>This was what Neptune and Apollo were to do in after time; but 
<A NAME="36"></A>as yet battle and turmoil were still raging round the wall till its timbers 
<A NAME="37"></A>rang under the blows that rained upon them. The Argives, cowed by the scourge 
<A NAME="38"></A>of Jove, were hemmed in at their ships in fear of Hector the mighty minister 
<A NAME="39"></A>of Rout, who as heretofore fought with the force and fury of a whirlwind. 
<A NAME="40"></A>As a lion or wild boar turns fiercely on the dogs and men that attack him, 
<A NAME="41"></A>while these form solid wall and shower their javelins as they face him- 
<A NAME="42"></A>his courage is all undaunted, but his high spirit will be the death of 
<A NAME="43"></A>him; many a time does he charge at his pursuers to scatter them, and they 
<A NAME="44"></A>fall back as often as he does so- even so did Hector go about among the 
<A NAME="45"></A>host exhorting his men, and cheering them on to cross the 
<A NAME="46"></A>trench.
<A NAME="47"></A><BR><BR>But the horses dared not do so, and stood neighing upon its brink, 
<A NAME="48"></A>for the width frightened them. They could neither jump it nor cross it, 
<A NAME="49"></A>for it had overhanging banks all round upon either side, above which there 
<A NAME="50"></A>were the sharp stakes that the sons of the Achaeans had planted so close 
<A NAME="51"></A>and strong as a defence against all who would assail it; a horse, therefore, 
<A NAME="52"></A>could not get into it and draw his chariot after him, but those who were 
<A NAME="53"></A>on foot kept trying their very utmost. Then Polydamas went up to Hector 
<A NAME="54"></A>and said, "Hector, and you other captains of the Trojans and allies, it 
<A NAME="55"></A>is madness for us to try and drive our horses across the trench; it will 
<A NAME="56"></A>be very hard to cross, for it is full of sharp stakes, and beyond these 
<A NAME="57"></A>there is the wall. Our horses therefore cannot get down into it, and would 
<A NAME="58"></A>be of no use if they did; moreover it is a narrow place and we should come 
<A NAME="59"></A>to harm. If, indeed, great Jove is minded to help the Trojans, and in his 
<A NAME="60"></A>anger will utterly destroy the Achaeans, I would myself gladly see them 
<A NAME="61"></A>perish now and here far from Argos; but if they should rally and we are 
<A NAME="62"></A>driven back from the ships pell-mell into the trench there will be not 
<A NAME="63"></A>so much as a man get back to the city to tell the tale. Now, therefore, 
<A NAME="64"></A>let us all do as I say; let our squires hold our horses by the trench, 
<A NAME="65"></A>but let us follow Hector in a body on foot, clad in full armour, and if 
<A NAME="66"></A>the day of their doom is at hand the Achaeans will not be able to withstand 
<A NAME="67"></A>us."
<A NAME="68"></A><BR><BR>Thus spoke Polydamas and his saying pleased Hector, who sprang 
<A NAME="69"></A>in full armour to the ground, and all the other Trojans, when they saw 
<A NAME="70"></A>him do so, also left their chariots. Each man then gave his horses over 
<A NAME="71"></A>to his charioteer in charge to hold them ready for him at the trench. Then 
<A NAME="72"></A>they formed themselves into companies, made themselves ready, and in five 
<A NAME="73"></A>bodies followed their leaders. Those that went with Hector and Polydamas 
<A NAME="74"></A>were the bravest and most in number, and the most determined to break through 
<A NAME="75"></A>the wall and fight at the ships. Cebriones was also joined with them as 
<A NAME="76"></A>third in command, for Hector had left his chariot in charge of a less valiant 
<A NAME="77"></A>soldier. The next company was led by Paris, Alcathous, and Agenor; the 
<A NAME="78"></A>third by Helenus and Deiphobus, two sons of Priam, and with them was the 
<A NAME="79"></A>hero Asius- Asius the son of Hyrtacus, whose great black horses of the 
<A NAME="80"></A>breed that comes from the river Selleis had brought him from Arisbe. Aeneas 
<A NAME="81"></A>the valiant son of Anchises led the fourth; he and the two sons of Antenor, 
<A NAME="82"></A>Archelochus and Acamas, men well versed in all the arts of war. Sarpedon 
<A NAME="83"></A>was captain over the allies, and took with him Glaucus and Asteropaeus 
<A NAME="84"></A>whom he deemed most valiant after himself- for he was far the best man 
<A NAME="85"></A>of them all. These helped to array one another in their ox-hide shields, 
<A NAME="86"></A>and then charged straight at the Danaans, for they felt sure that they 
<A NAME="87"></A>would not hold out longer and that they should themselves now fall upon 
<A NAME="88"></A>the ships.
<A NAME="89"></A><BR><BR>The rest of the Trojans and their allies now followed the counsel 
<A NAME="90"></A>of Polydamas but Asius son of Hyrtacus would not leave his horses and his 
<A NAME="91"></A>esquire behind him; in his foolhardiness he took them on with him towards 
<A NAME="92"></A>the ships, nor did he fail to come by his end in consequence. Nevermore 
<A NAME="93"></A>was he to return to wind-beaten Ilius, exulting in his chariot and his 
<A NAME="94"></A>horses; ere he could do so, death of ill-omened name had overshadowed him 
<A NAME="95"></A>and he had fallen by the spear of Idomeneus the noble son of Deucalion. 
<A NAME="96"></A>He had driven towards the left wing of the ships, by which way the Achaeans 
<A NAME="97"></A>used to return with their chariots and horses from the plain. Hither he 
<A NAME="98"></A>drove and found the gates with their doors opened wide, and the great bar 
<A NAME="99"></A>down- for the gatemen kept them open so as to let those of their comrades 
<A NAME="100"></A>enter who might be flying towards the ships. Hither of set purpose did 
<A NAME="101"></A>he direct his horses, and his men followed him with a loud cry, for they 
<A NAME="102"></A>felt sure that the Achaeans would not hold out longer, and that they should 
<A NAME="103"></A>now fall upon the ships. Little did they know that at the gates they should 
<A NAME="104"></A>find two of the bravest chieftains, proud sons of the fighting Lapithae- 
<A NAME="105"></A>the one, Polypoetes, mighty son of Pirithous, and the other Leonteus, peer 
<A NAME="106"></A>of murderous Mars. These stood before the gates like two high oak trees 
<A NAME="107"></A>upon the mountains, that tower from their wide-spreading roots, and year 
<A NAME="108"></A>after year battle with wind and rain- even so did these two men await the 
<A NAME="109"></A>onset of great Asius confidently and without flinching. The Trojans led 
<A NAME="110"></A>by him and by Iamenus, Orestes, Adamas the son of Asius, Thoon and Oenomaus, 
<A NAME="111"></A>raised a loud cry of battle and made straight for the wall, holding their 
<A NAME="112"></A>shields of dry ox-hide above their heads; for a while the two defenders 
<A NAME="113"></A>remained inside and cheered the Achaeans on to stand firm in the defence 
<A NAME="114"></A>of their ships; when, however, they saw that the Trojans were attacking 
<A NAME="115"></A>the wall, while the Danaans were crying out for help and being routed, 
<A NAME="116"></A>they rushed outside and fought in front of the gates like two wild boars 
<A NAME="117"></A>upon the mountains that abide the attack of men and dogs, and charging 
<A NAME="118"></A>on either side break down the wood all round them tearing it up by the 
<A NAME="119"></A>roots, and one can hear the clattering of their tusks, till some one hits 
<A NAME="120"></A>them and makes an end of them- even so did the gleaming bronze rattle about 
<A NAME="121"></A>their breasts, as the weapons fell upon them; for they fought with great 
<A NAME="122"></A>fury, trusting to their own prowess and to those who were on the wall above 
<A NAME="123"></A>them. These threw great stones at their assailants in defence of themselves 
<A NAME="124"></A>their tents and their ships. The stones fell thick as the flakes of snow 
<A NAME="125"></A>which some fierce blast drives from the dark clouds and showers down in 
<A NAME="126"></A>sheets upon the earth- even so fell the weapons from the hands alike of 
<A NAME="127"></A>Trojans and Achaeans. Helmet and shield rang out as the great stones rained 
<A NAME="128"></A>upon them, and Asius the son of Hyrtacus in his dismay cried aloud and 
<A NAME="129"></A>smote his two thighs. "Father Jove," he cried, "of a truth you too are 
<A NAME="130"></A>altogether given to lying. I made sure the Argive heroes could not withstand 
<A NAME="131"></A>us, whereas like slim-waisted wasps, or bees that have their nests in the 
<A NAME="132"></A>rocks by the wayside- they leave not the holes wherein they have built 
<A NAME="133"></A>undefended, but fight for their little ones against all who would take 
<A NAME="134"></A>them- even so these men, though they be but two, will not be driven from 
<A NAME="135"></A>the gates, but stand firm either to slay or be slain."
<A NAME="136"></A><BR><BR>He spoke, but moved not the mind of Jove, whose counsel it then 
<A NAME="137"></A>was to give glory to Hector. Meanwhile the rest of the Trojans were fighting 
<A NAME="138"></A>about the other gates; I, however, am no god to be able to tell about all 
<A NAME="139"></A>these things, for the battle raged everywhere about the stone wall as it 
<A NAME="140"></A>were a fiery furnace. The Argives, discomfited though they were, were forced 
<A NAME="141"></A>to defend their ships, and all the gods who were defending the Achaeans 
<A NAME="142"></A>were vexed in spirit; but the Lapithae kept on fighting with might and 
<A NAME="143"></A>main.
<A NAME="144"></A><BR><BR>Thereon Polypoetes, mighty son of Pirithous, hit Damasus with a 
<A NAME="145"></A>spear upon his cheek-pierced helmet. The helmet did not protect him, for 
<A NAME="146"></A>the point of the spear went through it, and broke the bone, so that the 
<A NAME="147"></A>brain inside was scattered about, and he died fighting. He then slew Pylon 
<A NAME="148"></A>and Ormenus. Leonteus, of the race of Mars, killed Hippomachus the son 
<A NAME="149"></A>of Antimachus by striking him with his spear upon the girdle. He then drew 
<A NAME="150"></A>his sword and sprang first upon Antiphates whom he killed in combat, and 
<A NAME="151"></A>who fell face upwards on the earth. After him he killed Menon, Iamenus, 
<A NAME="152"></A>and Orestes, and laid them low one after the other.
<A NAME="153"></A><BR><BR>While they were busy stripping the armour from these heroes, the 
<A NAME="154"></A>youths who were led on by Polydamas and Hector (and these were the greater 
<A NAME="155"></A>part and the most valiant of those that were trying to break through the 
<A NAME="156"></A>wall and fire the ships) were still standing by the trench, uncertain what 
<A NAME="157"></A>they should do; for they had seen a sign from heaven when they had essayed 
<A NAME="158"></A>to cross it- a soaring eagle that flew skirting the left wing of their 
<A NAME="159"></A>host, with a monstrous blood-red snake in its talons still alive and struggling 
<A NAME="160"></A>to escape. The snake was still bent on revenge, wriggling and twisting 
<A NAME="161"></A>itself backwards till it struck the bird that held it, on the neck and 
<A NAME="162"></A>breast; whereon the bird being in pain, let it fall, dropping it into the 
<A NAME="163"></A>middle of the host, and then flew down the wind with a sharp cry. The Trojans 
<A NAME="164"></A>were struck with terror when they saw the snake, portent of aegis-bearing 
<A NAME="165"></A>Jove, writhing in the midst of them, and Polydamas went up to Hector and 
<A NAME="166"></A>said, "Hector, at our councils of war you are ever given to rebuke me, 
<A NAME="167"></A>even when I speak wisely, as though it were not well, forsooth, that one 
<A NAME="168"></A>of the people should cross your will either in the field or at the council 
<A NAME="169"></A>board; you would have them support you always: nevertheless I will say 
<A NAME="170"></A>what I think will be best; let us not now go on to fight the Danaans at 
<A NAME="171"></A>their ships, for I know what will happen if this soaring eagle which skirted 
<A NAME="172"></A>the left wing of our with a monstrous blood-red snake in its talons (the 
<A NAME="173"></A>snake being still alive) was really sent as an omen to the Trojans on their 
<A NAME="174"></A>essaying to cross the trench. The eagle let go her hold; she did not succeed 
<A NAME="175"></A>in taking it home to her little ones, and so will it be- with ourselves; 
<A NAME="176"></A>even though by a mighty effort we break through the gates and wall of the 
<A NAME="177"></A>Achaeans, and they give way before us, still we shall not return in good 
<A NAME="178"></A>order by the way we came, but shall leave many a man behind us whom the 
<A NAME="179"></A>Achaeans will do to death in defence of their ships. Thus would any seer 
<A NAME="180"></A>who was expert in these matters, and was trusted by the people, read the 
<A NAME="181"></A>portent."
<A NAME="182"></A><BR><BR>Hector looked fiercely at him and said, "Polydamas, I like not 
<A NAME="183"></A>of your reading. You can find a better saying than this if you will. If, 
<A NAME="184"></A>however, you have spoken in good earnest, then indeed has heaven robbed 
<A NAME="185"></A>you of your reason. You would have me pay no heed to the counsels of Jove, 
<A NAME="186"></A>nor to the promises he made me- and he bowed his head in confirmation; 
<A NAME="187"></A>you bid me be ruled rather by the flight of wild-fowl. What care I whether 
<A NAME="188"></A>they fly towards dawn or dark, and whether they be on my right hand or 
<A NAME="189"></A>on my left? Let us put our trust rather in the counsel of great Jove, king 
<A NAME="190"></A>of mortals and immortals. There is one omen, and one only- that a man should 
<A NAME="191"></A>fight for his country. Why are you so fearful? Though we be all of us slain 
<A NAME="192"></A>at the ships of the Argives you are not likely to be killed yourself, for 
<A NAME="193"></A>you are not steadfast nor courageous. If you will. not fight, or would 
<A NAME="194"></A>talk others over from doing so, you shall fall forthwith before my 
<A NAME="195"></A>spear."
<A NAME="196"></A><BR><BR>With these words he led the way, and the others followed after 
<A NAME="197"></A>with a cry that rent the air. Then Jove the lord of thunder sent the blast 
<A NAME="198"></A>of a mighty wind from the mountains of Ida, that bore the dust down towards 
<A NAME="199"></A>the ships; he thus lulled the Achaeans into security, and gave victory 
<A NAME="200"></A>to Hector and to the Trojans, who, trusting to their own might and to the 
<A NAME="201"></A>signs he had shown them, essayed to break through the great wall of the 
<A NAME="202"></A>Achaeans. They tore down the breastworks from the walls, and overthrew 
<A NAME="203"></A>the battlements; they upheaved the buttresses, which the Achaeans had set 
<A NAME="204"></A>in front of the wall in order to support it; when they had pulled these 
<A NAME="205"></A>down they made sure of breaking through the wall, but the Danaans still 
<A NAME="206"></A>showed no sign of giving ground; they still fenced the battlements with 
<A NAME="207"></A>their shields of ox-hide, and hurled their missiles down upon the foe as 
<A NAME="208"></A>soon as any came below the wall.
<A NAME="209"></A><BR><BR>The two Ajaxes went about everywhere on the walls cheering on the 
<A NAME="210"></A>Achaeans, giving fair words to some while they spoke sharply to any one 
<A NAME="211"></A>whom they saw to be remiss. "My friends," they cried, "Argives one and 
<A NAME="212"></A>all- good bad and indifferent, for there was never fight yet, in which 
<A NAME="213"></A>all were of equal prowess- there is now work enough, as you very well know, 
<A NAME="214"></A>for all of you. See that you none of you turn in flight towards the ships, 
<A NAME="215"></A>daunted by the shouting of the foe, but press forward and keep one another 
<A NAME="216"></A>in heart, if it may so be that Olympian Jove the lord of lightning will 
<A NAME="217"></A>vouchsafe us to repel our foes, and drive them back towards the 
<A NAME="218"></A>city."
<A NAME="219"></A><BR><BR>Thus did the two go about shouting and cheering the Achaeans on. 
<A NAME="220"></A>As the flakes that fall thick upon a winter's day, when Jove is minded 
<A NAME="221"></A>to snow and to display these his arrows to mankind- he lulls the wind to 
<A NAME="222"></A>rest, and snows hour after hour till he has buried the tops of the high 
<A NAME="223"></A>mountains, the headlands that jut into the sea, the grassy plains, and 
<A NAME="224"></A>the tilled fields of men; the snow lies deep upon the forelands, and havens 
<A NAME="225"></A>of the grey sea, but the waves as they come rolling in stay it that it 
<A NAME="226"></A>can come no further, though all else is wrapped as with a mantle so heavy 
<A NAME="227"></A>are the heavens with snow- even thus thickly did the stones fall on one 
<A NAME="228"></A>side and on the other, some thrown at the Trojans, and some by the Trojans 
<A NAME="229"></A>at the Achaeans; and the whole wall was in an uproar.
<A NAME="230"></A><BR><BR>Still the Trojans and brave Hector would not yet have broken down 
<A NAME="231"></A>the gates and the great bar, had not Jove turned his son Sarpedon against 
<A NAME="232"></A>the Argives as a lion against a herd of horned cattle. Before him he held 
<A NAME="233"></A>his shield of hammered bronze, that the smith had beaten so fair and round, 
<A NAME="234"></A>and had lined with ox hides which he had made fast with rivets of gold 
<A NAME="235"></A>all round the shield; this he held in front of him, and brandishing his 
<A NAME="236"></A>two spears came on like some lion of the wilderness, who has been long 
<A NAME="237"></A>famished for want of meat and will dare break even into a well-fenced homestead 
<A NAME="238"></A>to try and get at the sheep. He may find the shepherds keeping watch over 
<A NAME="239"></A>their flocks with dogs and spears, but he is in no mind to be driven from 
<A NAME="240"></A>the fold till he has had a try for it; he will either spring on a sheep 
<A NAME="241"></A>and carry it off, or be hit by a spear from strong hand- even so was Sarpedon 
<A NAME="242"></A>fain to attack the wall and break down its battlements. Then he said to 
<A NAME="243"></A>Glaucus son of Hippolochus, "Glaucus, why in Lycia do we receive especial 
<A NAME="244"></A>honour as regards our place at table? Why are the choicest portions served 
<A NAME="245"></A>us and our cups kept brimming, and why do men look up to us as though we 
<A NAME="246"></A>were gods? Moreover we hold a large estate by the banks of the river Xanthus, 
<A NAME="247"></A>fair with orchard lawns and wheat-growing land; it becomes us, therefore, 
<A NAME="248"></A>to take our stand at the head of all the Lycians and bear the brunt of 
<A NAME="249"></A>the fight, that one may say to another, Our princes in Lycia eat the fat 
<A NAME="250"></A>of the land and drink best of wine, but they are fine fellows; they fight 
<A NAME="251"></A>well and are ever at the front in battle.' My good friend, if, when we 
<A NAME="252"></A>were once out of this fight, we could escape old age and death thenceforward 
<A NAME="253"></A>and for ever, I should neither press forward myself nor bid you do so, 
<A NAME="254"></A>but death in ten thousand shapes hangs ever over our heads, and no man 
<A NAME="255"></A>can elude him; therefore let us go forward and either win glory for ourselves, 
<A NAME="256"></A>or yield it to another."
<A NAME="257"></A><BR><BR>Glaucus heeded his saying, and the pair forthwith led on the host 
<A NAME="258"></A>of Lycians. Menestheus son of Peteos was dismayed when he saw them, for 
<A NAME="259"></A>it was against his part of the wall that they came- bringing destruction 
<A NAME="260"></A>with them; he looked along the wall for some chieftain to support his comrades 
<A NAME="261"></A>and saw the two Ajaxes, men ever eager for the fray, and Teucer, who had 
<A NAME="262"></A>just come from his tent, standing near them; but he could not make his 
<A NAME="263"></A>voice heard by shouting to them, so great an uproar was there from crashing 
<A NAME="264"></A>shields and helmets and the battering of gates with a din which reached 
<A NAME="265"></A>the skies. For all the gates had been closed, and the Trojans were hammering 
<A NAME="266"></A>at them to try and break their way through them. Menestheus, therefore, 
<A NAME="267"></A>sent Thootes with a message to Ajax. "Run, good Thootes," said and call 
<A NAME="268"></A>Ajax, or better still bid both come, for it will be all over with us here 
<A NAME="269"></A>directly; the leaders of the Lycians are upon us, men who have ever fought 
<A NAME="270"></A>desperately heretofore. But if the have too much on their hands to let 
<A NAME="271"></A>them come, at any rate let Ajax son of Telamon do so, and let Teucer the 
<A NAME="272"></A>famous bowman come with him."
<A NAME="273"></A><BR><BR>The messenger did as he was told, and set off running along the 
<A NAME="274"></A>wall of the Achaeans. When he reached the Ajaxes he said to them, "Sirs, 
<A NAME="275"></A>princes of the Argives, the son of noble Peteos bids you come to him for 
<A NAME="276"></A>a while and help him. You had better both come if you can, or it will be 
<A NAME="277"></A>all over with him directly; the leaders of the Lycians are upon him, men 
<A NAME="278"></A>who have ever fought desperately heretofore; if you have too much on your 
<A NAME="279"></A>hands to let both come, at any rate let Ajax son of Telamon do so, and 
<A NAME="280"></A>let Teucer the famous bowman come with him."
<A NAME="281"></A><BR><BR>Great Ajax, son of Telamon, heeded the message, and at once spoke 
<A NAME="282"></A>to the son of Oileus. "Ajax," said he, "do you two, yourself and brave 
<A NAME="283"></A>Lycomedes, stay here and keep the Danaans in heart to fight their hardest. 
<A NAME="284"></A>I will go over yonder, and bear my part in the fray, but I will come back 
<A NAME="285"></A>here at once as soon as I have given them the help they 
<A NAME="286"></A>need."
<A NAME="287"></A><BR><BR>With this, Ajax son of Telamon set off, and Teucer his brother 
<A NAME="288"></A>by the same father went also, with Pandion to carry Teucer's bow. They 
<A NAME="289"></A>went along inside the wall, and when they came to the tower where Menestheus 
<A NAME="290"></A>was (and hard pressed indeed did they find him) the brave captains and 
<A NAME="291"></A>leaders of the Lycians were storming the battlements as it were a thick 
<A NAME="292"></A>dark cloud, fighting in close quarters, and raising the battle-cry 
<A NAME="293"></A>aloud.
<A NAME="294"></A><BR><BR>First, Ajax son of Telamon killed brave Epicles, a comrade of Sarpedon, 
<A NAME="295"></A>hitting him with a jagged stone that lay by the battlements at the very 
<A NAME="296"></A>top of the wall. As men now are, even one who is in the bloom of youth 
<A NAME="297"></A>could hardly lift it with his two hands, but Ajax raised it high aloft 
<A NAME="298"></A>and flung it down, smashing Epicles' four-crested helmet so that the bones 
<A NAME="299"></A>of his head were crushed to pieces, and he fell from the high wall as though 
<A NAME="300"></A>he were diving, with no more life left in him. Then Teucer wounded Glaucus 
<A NAME="301"></A>the brave son of Hippolochus as he was coming on to attack the wall. He 
<A NAME="302"></A>saw his shoulder bare and aimed an arrow at it, which made Glaucus leave 
<A NAME="303"></A>off fighting. Thereon he sprang covertly down for fear some of the Achaeans 
<A NAME="304"></A>might see that he was wounded and taunt him. Sarpedon was stung with grief 
<A NAME="305"></A>when he saw Glaucus leave him, still he did not leave off fighting, but 
<A NAME="306"></A>aimed his spear at Alcmaon the son of Thestor and hit him. He drew his 
<A NAME="307"></A>spear back again Alcmaon came down headlong after it with his bronzed armour 
<A NAME="308"></A>rattling round him. Then Sarpedon seized the battlement in his strong hands, 
<A NAME="309"></A>and tugged at it till it an gave way together, and a breach was made through 
<A NAME="310"></A>which many might pass.
<A NAME="311"></A><BR><BR>Ajax and Teucer then both of them attacked him. Teucer hit him 
<A NAME="312"></A>with an arrow on the band that bore the shield which covered his body, 
<A NAME="313"></A>but Jove saved his son from destruction that he might not fall by the ships' 
<A NAME="314"></A>sterns. Meanwhile Ajax sprang on him and pierced his shield, but the spear 
<A NAME="315"></A>did not go clean through, though it hustled him back that he could come 
<A NAME="316"></A>on no further. He therefore retired a little space from the battlement, 
<A NAME="317"></A>yet without losing all his ground, for he still thought to cover himself 
<A NAME="318"></A>with glory. Then he turned round and shouted to the brave Lycians saying, 
<A NAME="319"></A>"Lycians, why do you thus fail me? For all my prowess I cannot break through 
<A NAME="320"></A>the wall and open a way to the ships single-handed. Come close on behind 
<A NAME="321"></A>me, for the more there are of us the better."
<A NAME="322"></A><BR><BR>The Lycians, shamed by his rebuke, pressed closer round him who 
<A NAME="323"></A>was their counsellor their king. The Argives on their part got their men 
<A NAME="324"></A>in fighting order within the wall, and there was a deadly struggle between 
<A NAME="325"></A>them. The Lycians could not break through the wall and force their way 
<A NAME="326"></A>to the ships, nor could the Danaans drive the Lycians from the wall now 
<A NAME="327"></A>that they had once reached it. As two men, measuring-rods in hand, quarrel 
<A NAME="328"></A>about their boundaries in a field that they own in common, and stickle 
<A NAME="329"></A>for their rights though they be but in a mere strip, even so did the battlements 
<A NAME="330"></A>now serve as a bone of contention, and they beat one another's round shields 
<A NAME="331"></A>for their possession. Many a man's body was wounded with the pitiless bronze, 
<A NAME="332"></A>as he turned round and bared his back to the foe, and many were struck 
<A NAME="333"></A>clean through their shields; the wall and battlements were everywhere deluged 
<A NAME="334"></A>with the blood alike of Trojans and of Achaeans. But even so the Trojans 
<A NAME="335"></A>could not rout the Achaeans, who still held on; and as some honest hard-working 
<A NAME="336"></A>woman weighs wool in her balance and sees that the scales be true, for 
<A NAME="337"></A>she would gain some pitiful earnings for her little ones, even so was the 
<A NAME="338"></A>fight balanced evenly between them till the time came when Jove gave the 
<A NAME="339"></A>greater glory to Hector son of Priam, who was first to spring towards the 
<A NAME="340"></A>wall of the Achaeans. As he did so, he cried aloud to the Trojans, "Up, 
<A NAME="341"></A>Trojans, break the wall of the Argives, and fling fire upon their 
<A NAME="342"></A>ships."
<A NAME="343"></A><BR><BR>Thus did he hound them on, and in one body they rushed straight 
<A NAME="344"></A>at the wall as he had bidden them, and scaled the battlements with sharp 
<A NAME="345"></A>spears in their hands. Hector laid hold of a stone that lay just outside 
<A NAME="346"></A>the gates and was thick at one end but pointed at the other; two of the 
<A NAME="347"></A>best men in a town, as men now are, could hardly raise it from the ground 
<A NAME="348"></A>and put it on to a waggon, but Hector lifted it quite easily by himself, 
<A NAME="349"></A>for the son of scheming Saturn made it light for him. As a shepherd picks 
<A NAME="350"></A>up a ram's fleece with one hand and finds it no burden, so easily did Hector 
<A NAME="351"></A>lift the great stone and drive it right at the doors that closed the gates 
<A NAME="352"></A>so strong and so firmly set. These doors were double and high, and were 
<A NAME="353"></A>kept closed by two cross-bars to which there was but one key. When he had 
<A NAME="354"></A>got close up to them, Hector strode towards them that his blow might gain 
<A NAME="355"></A>in force and struck them in the middle, leaning his whole weight against 
<A NAME="356"></A>them. He broke both hinges, and the stone fell inside by reason of its 
<A NAME="357"></A>great weight. The portals re-echoed with the sound, the bars held no longer, 
<A NAME="358"></A>and the doors flew open, one one way, and the other the other, through 
<A NAME="359"></A>the force of the blow. Then brave Hector leaped inside with a face as dark 
<A NAME="360"></A>as that of flying night. The gleaming bronze flashed fiercely about his 
<A NAME="361"></A>body and he had tow spears in his hand. None but a god could have withstood 
<A NAME="362"></A>him as he flung himself into the gateway, and his eyes glared like fire. 
<A NAME="363"></A>Then he turned round towards the Trojans and called on them to scale the 
<A NAME="364"></A>wall, and they did as he bade them- some of them at once climbing over 
<A NAME="365"></A>the wall, while others passed through the gates. The Danaans then fled 
<A NAME="366"></A>panic-stricken towards their ships, and all was uproar and 
<A NAME="367"></A>confusion.
