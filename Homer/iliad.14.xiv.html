<A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A>Nestor was sitting over his wine, but the cry of battle did not escape 
<A NAME="11"></A>him, and he said to the son of Aesculapius, "What, noble Machaon, is the 
<A NAME="12"></A>meaning of all this? The shouts of men fighting by our ships grow stronger 
<A NAME="13"></A>and stronger; stay here, therefore, and sit over your wine, while fair 
<A NAME="14"></A>Hecamede heats you a bath and washes the clotted blood from off you. I 
<A NAME="15"></A>will go at once to the look-out station and see what it is all 
<A NAME="16"></A>about."
<A NAME="17"></A><BR><BR>As he spoke he took up the shield of his son Thrasymedes that was 
<A NAME="18"></A>lying in his tent, all gleaming with bronze, for Thrasymedes had taken 
<A NAME="19"></A>his father's shield; he grasped his redoubtable bronze-shod spear, and 
<A NAME="20"></A>as soon as he was outside saw the disastrous rout of the Achaeans who, 
<A NAME="21"></A>now that their wall was overthrown, were flying pell-mell before the Trojans. 
<A NAME="22"></A>As when there is a heavy swell upon the sea, but the waves are dumb- they 
<A NAME="23"></A>keep their eyes on the watch for the quarter whence the fierce winds may 
<A NAME="24"></A>spring upon them, but they stay where they are and set neither this way 
<A NAME="25"></A>nor that, till some particular wind sweeps down from heaven to determine 
<A NAME="26"></A>them- even so did the old man ponder whether to make for the crowd of Danaans, 
<A NAME="27"></A>or go in search of Agamemnon. In the end he deemed it best to go to the 
<A NAME="28"></A>son of Atreus; but meanwhile the hosts were fighting and killing one another, 
<A NAME="29"></A>and the hard bronze rattled on their bodies, as they thrust at one another 
<A NAME="30"></A>with their swords and spears.
<A NAME="31"></A><BR><BR>The wounded kings, the son of Tydeus, Ulysses, and Agamemnon son 
<A NAME="32"></A>of Atreus, fell in Nestor as they were coming up from their ships- for 
<A NAME="33"></A>theirs were drawn up some way from where the fighting was going on, being 
<A NAME="34"></A>on the shore itself inasmuch as they had been beached first, while the 
<A NAME="35"></A>wall had been built behind the hindermost. The stretch of the shore, wide 
<A NAME="36"></A>though it was, did not afford room for all the ships, and the host was 
<A NAME="37"></A>cramped for space, therefore they had placed the ships in rows one behind 
<A NAME="38"></A>the other, and had filled the whole opening of the bay between the two 
<A NAME="39"></A>points that formed it. The kings, leaning on their spears, were coming 
<A NAME="40"></A>out to survey the fight, being in great anxiety, and when old Nestor met 
<A NAME="41"></A>them they were filled with dismay. Then King Agamemnon said to him, "Nestor 
<A NAME="42"></A>son of Neleus, honour to the Achaean name, why have you left the battle 
<A NAME="43"></A>to come hither? I fear that what dread Hector said will come true, when 
<A NAME="44"></A>he vaunted among the Trojans saying that he would not return to Ilius till 
<A NAME="45"></A>he had fired our ships and killed us; this is what he said, and now it 
<A NAME="46"></A>is all coming true. Alas! others of the Achaeans, like Achilles, are in 
<A NAME="47"></A>anger with me that they refuse to fight by the sterns of our 
<A NAME="48"></A>ships."
<A NAME="49"></A><BR><BR>Then Nestor knight of Gerene answered, "It is indeed as you say; 
<A NAME="50"></A>it is all coming true at this moment, and even Jove who thunders from on 
<A NAME="51"></A>high cannot prevent it. Fallen is the wall on which we relied as an impregnable 
<A NAME="52"></A>bulwark both for us and our fleet. The Trojans are fighting stubbornly 
<A NAME="53"></A>and without ceasing at the ships; look where you may you cannot see from 
<A NAME="54"></A>what quarter the rout of the Achaeans is coming; they are being killed 
<A NAME="55"></A>in a confused mass and the battle-cry ascends to heaven; let us think, 
<A NAME="56"></A>if counsel can be of any use, what we had better do; but I do not advise 
<A NAME="57"></A>our going into battle ourselves, for a man cannot fight when he is 
<A NAME="58"></A>wounded."
<A NAME="59"></A><BR><BR>And King Agamemnon answered, "Nestor, if the Trojans are indeed 
<A NAME="60"></A>fighting at the rear of our ships, and neither the wall nor the trench 
<A NAME="61"></A>has served us- over which the Danaans toiled so hard, and which they deemed 
<A NAME="62"></A>would be an impregnable bulwark both for us and our fleet- I see it must 
<A NAME="63"></A>be the will of Jove that the Achaeans should perish ingloriously here, 
<A NAME="64"></A>far from Argos. I knew when Jove was willing to defend us, and I know now 
<A NAME="65"></A>that he is raising the Trojans to like honour with the gods, while us, 
<A NAME="66"></A>on the other hand, he bas bound hand and foot. Now, therefore, let us all 
<A NAME="67"></A>do as I say; let us bring down the ships that are on the beach and draw 
<A NAME="68"></A>them into the water; let us make them fast to their mooring-stones a little 
<A NAME="69"></A>way out, against the fall of night- if even by night the Trojans will desist 
<A NAME="70"></A>from fighting; we may then draw down the rest of the fleet. There is nothing 
<A NAME="71"></A>wrong in flying ruin even by night. It is better for a man that he should 
<A NAME="72"></A>fly and be saved than be caught and killed."
<A NAME="73"></A><BR><BR>Ulysses looked fiercely at him and said, "Son of Atreus, what are 
<A NAME="74"></A>you talking about? Wretch, you should have commanded some other and baser 
<A NAME="75"></A>army, and not been ruler over us to whom Jove has allotted a life of hard 
<A NAME="76"></A>fighting from youth to old age, till we every one of us perish. Is it thus 
<A NAME="77"></A>that you would quit the city of Troy, to win which we have suffered so 
<A NAME="78"></A>much hardship? Hold your peace, lest some other of the Achaeans hear you 
<A NAME="79"></A>say what no man who knows how to give good counsel, no king over so great 
<A NAME="80"></A>a host as that of the Argives should ever have let fall from his lips. 
<A NAME="81"></A>I despise your judgement utterly for what you have been saying. Would you, 
<A NAME="82"></A>then, have us draw down our ships into the water while the battle is raging, 
<A NAME="83"></A>and thus play further into the hands of the conquering Trojans? It would 
<A NAME="84"></A>be ruin; the Achaeans will not go on fighting when they see the ships being 
<A NAME="85"></A>drawn into the water, but will cease attacking and keep turning their eyes 
<A NAME="86"></A>towards them; your counsel, therefore, Sir captain, would be our 
<A NAME="87"></A>destruction."
<A NAME="88"></A><BR><BR>Agamemnon answered, "Ulysses, your rebuke has stung me to the heart. 
<A NAME="89"></A>I am not, however, ordering the Achaeans to draw their ships into the sea 
<A NAME="90"></A>whether they will or no. Some one, it may be, old or young, can offer us 
<A NAME="91"></A>better counsel which I shall rejoice to hear."
<A NAME="92"></A><BR><BR>Then said Diomed, "Such an one is at hand; he is not far to seek, 
<A NAME="93"></A>if you will listen to me and not resent my speaking though I am younger 
<A NAME="94"></A>than any of you. I am by lineage son to a noble sire, Tydeus, who lies 
<A NAME="95"></A>buried at Thebes. For Portheus had three noble sons, two of whom, Agrius 
<A NAME="96"></A>and Melas, abode in Pleuron and rocky Calydon. The third was the knight 
<A NAME="97"></A>Oeneus, my father's father, and he was the most valiant of them all. Oeeneus 
<A NAME="98"></A>remained in his own country, but my father (as Jove and the other gods 
<A NAME="99"></A>ordained it) migrated to Argos. He married into the family of Adrastus, 
<A NAME="100"></A>and his house was one of great abundance, for he had large estates of rich 
<A NAME="101"></A>corn-growing land, with much orchard ground as well, and he had many sheep; 
<A NAME="102"></A>moreover he excelled all the Argives in the use of the spear. You must 
<A NAME="103"></A>yourselves have heard whether these things are true or no; therefore when 
<A NAME="104"></A>I say well despise not my words as though I were a coward or of ignoble 
<A NAME="105"></A>birth. I say, then, let us go to the fight as we needs must, wounded though 
<A NAME="106"></A>we be. When there, we may keep out of the battle and beyond the range of 
<A NAME="107"></A>the spears lest we get fresh wounds in addition to what we have already, 
<A NAME="108"></A>but we can spur on others, who have been indulging their spleen and holding 
<A NAME="109"></A>aloof from battle hitherto."
<A NAME="110"></A><BR><BR>Thus did he speak; whereon they did even as he had said and set 
<A NAME="111"></A>out, King Agamemnon leading the way.
<A NAME="112"></A><BR><BR>Meanwhile Neptune had kept no blind look-out, and came up to them 
<A NAME="113"></A>in the semblance of an old man. He took Agamemnon's right hand in his own 
<A NAME="114"></A>and said, "Son of Atreus, I take it Achilles is glad now that he sees the 
<A NAME="115"></A>Achaeans routed and slain, for he is utterly without remorse- may he come 
<A NAME="116"></A>to a bad end and heaven confound him. As for yourself, the blessed gods 
<A NAME="117"></A>are not yet so bitterly angry with you but that the princes and counsellors 
<A NAME="118"></A>of the Trojans shall again raise the dust upon the plain, and you shall 
<A NAME="119"></A>see them flying from the ships and tents towards their 
<A NAME="120"></A>city."
<A NAME="121"></A><BR><BR>With this he raised a mighty cry of battle, and sped forward to 
<A NAME="122"></A>the plain. The voice that came from his deep chest was as that of nine 
<A NAME="123"></A>or ten thousand men when they are shouting in the thick of a fight, and 
<A NAME="124"></A>it put fresh courage into the hearts of the Achaeans to wage war and do 
<A NAME="125"></A>battle without ceasing.
<A NAME="126"></A><BR><BR>Juno of the golden throne looked down as she stood upon a peak 
<A NAME="127"></A>of Olympus and her heart was gladdened at the sight of him who was at once 
<A NAME="128"></A>her brother and her brother-in-law, hurrying hither and thither amid the 
<A NAME="129"></A>fighting. Then she turned her eyes to Jove as he sat on the topmost crests 
<A NAME="130"></A>of many-fountained Ida, and loathed him. She set herself to think how she 
<A NAME="131"></A>might hoodwink him, and in the end she deemed that it would be best for 
<A NAME="132"></A>her to go to Ida and array herself in rich attire, in the hope that Jove 
<A NAME="133"></A>might become enamoured of her, and wish to embrace her. While he was thus 
<A NAME="134"></A>engaged a sweet and careless sleep might be made to steal over his eyes 
<A NAME="135"></A>and senses.
<A NAME="136"></A><BR><BR>She went, therefore, to the room which her son Vulcan had made 
<A NAME="137"></A>her, and the doors of which he had cunningly fastened by means of a secret 
<A NAME="138"></A>key so that no other god could open them. Here she entered and closed the 
<A NAME="139"></A>doors behind her. She cleansed all the dirt from her fair body with ambrosia, 
<A NAME="140"></A>then she anointed herself with olive oil, ambrosial, very soft, and scented 
<A NAME="141"></A>specially for herself- if it were so much as shaken in the bronze-floored 
<A NAME="142"></A>house of Jove, the scent pervaded the universe of heaven and earth. With 
<A NAME="143"></A>this she anointed her delicate skin, and then she plaited the fair ambrosial 
<A NAME="144"></A>locks that flowed in a stream of golden tresses from her immortal head. 
<A NAME="145"></A>She put on the wondrous robe which Minerva had worked for her with consummate 
<A NAME="146"></A>art, and had embroidered with manifold devices; she fastened it about her 
<A NAME="147"></A>bosom with golden clasps, and she girded herself with a girdle that had 
<A NAME="148"></A>a hundred tassels: then she fastened her earrings, three brilliant pendants 
<A NAME="149"></A>that glistened most beautifully, through the pierced lobes of her ears, 
<A NAME="150"></A>and threw a lovely new veil over her head. She bound her sandals on to 
<A NAME="151"></A>her feet, and when she had arrayed herself perfectly to her satisfaction, 
<A NAME="152"></A>she left her room and called Venus to come aside and speak to her. "My 
<A NAME="153"></A>dear child," said she, "will you do what I am going to ask of you, or will 
<A NAME="154"></A>refuse me because you are angry at my being on the Danaan side, while you 
<A NAME="155"></A>are on the Trojan?"
<A NAME="156"></A><BR><BR>Jove's daughter Venus answered, "Juno, august queen of goddesses, 
<A NAME="157"></A>daughter of mighty Saturn, say what you want, and I will do it for at once, 
<A NAME="158"></A>if I can, and if it can be done at all."
<A NAME="159"></A><BR><BR>Then Juno told her a lying tale and said, "I want you to endow 
<A NAME="160"></A>me with some of those fascinating charms, the spells of which bring all 
<A NAME="161"></A>things mortal and immortal to your feet. I am going to the world's end 
<A NAME="162"></A>to visit Oceanus (from whom all we gods proceed) and mother Tethys: they 
<A NAME="163"></A>received me in their house, took care of me, and brought me up, having 
<A NAME="164"></A>taken me over from Rhaea when Jove imprisoned great Saturn in the depths 
<A NAME="165"></A>that are under earth and sea. I must go and see them that I may make peace 
<A NAME="166"></A>between them; they have been quarrelling, and are so angry that they have 
<A NAME="167"></A>not slept with one another this long while; if I can bring them round and 
<A NAME="168"></A>restore them to one another's embraces, they will be grateful to me and 
<A NAME="169"></A>love me for ever afterwards."
<A NAME="170"></A><BR><BR>Thereon laughter-loving Venus said, "I cannot and must not refuse 
<A NAME="171"></A>you, for you sleep in the arms of Jove who is our king."
<A NAME="172"></A><BR><BR>As she spoke she loosed from her bosom the curiously embroidered 
<A NAME="173"></A>girdle into which all her charms had been wrought- love, desire, and that 
<A NAME="174"></A>sweet flattery which steals the judgement even of the most prudent. She 
<A NAME="175"></A>gave the girdle to Juno and said, "Take this girdle wherein all my charms 
<A NAME="176"></A>reside and lay it in your bosom. If you will wear it I promise you that 
<A NAME="177"></A>your errand, be it what it may, will not be bootless."
<A NAME="178"></A><BR><BR>When she heard this Juno smiled, and still smiling she laid the 
<A NAME="179"></A>girdle in her bosom.
<A NAME="180"></A><BR><BR>Venus now went back into the house of Jove, while Juno darted down 
<A NAME="181"></A>from the summits of Olympus. She passed over Pieria and fair Emathia, and 
<A NAME="182"></A>went on and on till she came to the snowy ranges of the Thracian horsemen, 
<A NAME="183"></A>over whose topmost crests she sped without ever setting foot to ground. 
<A NAME="184"></A>When she came to Athos she went on over the, waves of the sea till she 
<A NAME="185"></A>reached Lemnos, the city of noble Thoas. There she met Sleep, own brother 
<A NAME="186"></A>to Death, and caught him by the hand, saying, "Sleep, you who lord it alike 
<A NAME="187"></A>over mortals and immortals, if you ever did me a service in times past, 
<A NAME="188"></A>do one for me now, and I shall be grateful to you ever after. Close Jove's 
<A NAME="189"></A>keen eyes for me in slumber while I hold him clasped in my embrace, and 
<A NAME="190"></A>I will give you a beautiful golden seat, that can never fall to pieces; 
<A NAME="191"></A>my clubfooted son Vulcan shall make it for you, and he shall give it a 
<A NAME="192"></A>footstool for you to rest your fair feet upon when you are at 
<A NAME="193"></A>table."
<A NAME="194"></A><BR><BR>Then Sleep answered, "Juno, great queen of goddesses, daughter 
<A NAME="195"></A>of mighty Saturn, I would lull any other of the gods to sleep without compunction, 
<A NAME="196"></A>not even excepting the waters of Oceanus from whom all of them proceed, 
<A NAME="197"></A>but I dare not go near Jove, nor send him to sleep unless he bids me. I 
<A NAME="198"></A>have had one lesson already through doing what you asked me, on the day 
<A NAME="199"></A>when Jove's mighty son Hercules set sail from Ilius after having sacked 
<A NAME="200"></A>the city of the Trojans. At your bidding I suffused my sweet self over 
<A NAME="201"></A>the mind of aegis-bearing Jove, and laid him to rest; meanwhile you hatched 
<A NAME="202"></A>a plot against Hercules, and set the blasts of the angry winds beating 
<A NAME="203"></A>upon the sea, till you took him to the goodly city of Cos away from all 
<A NAME="204"></A>his friends. Jove was furious when he awoke, and began hurling the gods 
<A NAME="205"></A>about all over the house; he was looking more particularly for myself, 
<A NAME="206"></A>and would have flung me down through space into the sea where I should 
<A NAME="207"></A>never have been heard of any more, had not Night who cows both men and 
<A NAME="208"></A>gods protected me. I fled to her and Jove left off looking for me in spite 
<A NAME="209"></A>of his being so angry, for he did not dare do anything to displease Night. 
<A NAME="210"></A>And now you are again asking me to do something on which I cannot 
<A NAME="211"></A>venture."
<A NAME="212"></A><BR><BR>And Juno said, "Sleep, why do you take such notions as those into 
<A NAME="213"></A>your head? Do you think Jove will be as anxious to help the Trojans, as 
<A NAME="214"></A>he was about his own son? Come, I will marry you to one of the youngest 
<A NAME="215"></A>of the Graces, and she shall be your own- Pasithea, whom you have always 
<A NAME="216"></A>wanted to marry."
<A NAME="217"></A><BR><BR>Sleep was pleased when he heard this, and answered, "Then swear 
<A NAME="218"></A>it to me by the dread waters of the river Styx; lay one hand on the bounteous 
<A NAME="219"></A>earth, and the other on the sheen of the sea, so that all the gods who 
<A NAME="220"></A>dwell down below with Saturn may be our witnesses, and see that you really 
<A NAME="221"></A>do give me one of the youngest of the Graces- Pasithea, whom I have always 
<A NAME="222"></A>wanted to marry."
<A NAME="223"></A><BR><BR>Juno did as he had said. She swore, and invoked all the gods of 
<A NAME="224"></A>the nether world, who are called Titans, to witness. When she had completed 
<A NAME="225"></A>her oath, the two enshrouded themselves in a thick mist and sped lightly 
<A NAME="226"></A>forward, leaving Lemnos and Imbrus behind them. Presently they reached 
<A NAME="227"></A>many-fountained Ida, mother of wild beasts, and Lectum where they left 
<A NAME="228"></A>the sea to go on by land, and the tops of the trees of the forest soughed 
<A NAME="229"></A>under the going of their feet. Here Sleep halted, and ere Jove caught sight 
<A NAME="230"></A>of him he climbed a lofty pine-tree- the tallest that reared its head towards 
<A NAME="231"></A>heaven on all Ida. He hid himself behind the branches and sat there in 
<A NAME="232"></A>the semblance of the sweet-singing bird that haunts the mountains and is 
<A NAME="233"></A>called Chalcis by the gods, but men call it Cymindis. Juno then went to 
<A NAME="234"></A>Gargarus, the topmost peak of Ida, and Jove, driver of the clouds, set 
<A NAME="235"></A>eyes upon her. As soon as he did so he became inflamed with the same passionate 
<A NAME="236"></A>desire for her that he had felt when they had first enjoyed each other's 
<A NAME="237"></A>embraces, and slept with one another without their dear parents knowing 
<A NAME="238"></A>anything about it. He went up to her and said, "What do you want that you 
<A NAME="239"></A>have come hither from Olympus- and that too with neither chariot nor horses 
<A NAME="240"></A>to convey you?"
<A NAME="241"></A><BR><BR>Then Juno told him a lying tale and said, "I am going to the world's 
<A NAME="242"></A>end, to visit Oceanus, from whom all we gods proceed, and mother Tethys; 
<A NAME="243"></A>they received me into their house, took care of me, and brought me up. 
<A NAME="244"></A>I must go and see them that I may make peace between them: they have been 
<A NAME="245"></A>quarrelling, and are so angry that they have not slept with one another 
<A NAME="246"></A>this long time. The horses that will take me over land and sea are stationed 
<A NAME="247"></A>on the lowermost spurs of many-fountained Ida, and I have come here from 
<A NAME="248"></A>Olympus on purpose to consult you. I was afraid you might be angry with 
<A NAME="249"></A>me later on, if I went to the house of Oceanus without letting you 
<A NAME="250"></A>know."
<A NAME="251"></A><BR><BR>And Jove said, "Juno, you can choose some other time for paying 
<A NAME="252"></A>your visit to Oceanus- for the present let us devote ourselves to love 
<A NAME="253"></A>and to the enjoyment of one another. Never yet have I been so overpowered 
<A NAME="254"></A>by passion neither for goddess nor mortal woman as I am at this moment 
<A NAME="255"></A>for yourself- not even when I was in love with the wife of Ixion who bore 
<A NAME="256"></A>me Pirithous, peer of gods in counsel, nor yet with Danae the daintily-ancled 
<A NAME="257"></A>daughter of Acrisius, who bore me the famed hero Perseus. Then there was 
<A NAME="258"></A>the daughter of Phoenix, who bore me Minos and Rhadamanthus: there was 
<A NAME="259"></A>Semele, and Alcmena in Thebes by whom I begot my lion-hearted son Hercules, 
<A NAME="260"></A>while Semele became mother to Bacchus the comforter of mankind. There was 
<A NAME="261"></A>queen Ceres again, and lovely Leto, and yourself- but with none of these 
<A NAME="262"></A>was I ever so much enamoured as I now am with you."
<A NAME="263"></A><BR><BR>Juno again answered him with a lying tale. "Most dread son of Saturn," 
<A NAME="264"></A>she exclaimed, "what are you talking about? Would you have us enjoy one 
<A NAME="265"></A>another here on the top of Mount Ida, where everything can be seen? What 
<A NAME="266"></A>if one of the ever-living gods should see us sleeping together, and tell 
<A NAME="267"></A>the others? It would be such a scandal that when I had risen from your 
<A NAME="268"></A>embraces I could never show myself inside your house again; but if you 
<A NAME="269"></A>are so minded, there is a room which your son Vulcan has made me, and he 
<A NAME="270"></A>has given it good strong doors; if you would so have it, let us go thither 
<A NAME="271"></A>and lie down."
<A NAME="272"></A><BR><BR>And Jove answered, "Juno, you need not be afraid that either god 
<A NAME="273"></A>or man will see you, for I will enshroud both of us in such a dense golden 
<A NAME="274"></A>cloud, that the very sun for all his bright piercing beams shall not see 
<A NAME="275"></A>through it."
<A NAME="276"></A><BR><BR>With this the son of Saturn caught his wife in his embrace; whereon 
<A NAME="277"></A>the earth sprouted them a cushion of young grass, with dew-bespangled lotus, 
<A NAME="278"></A>crocus, and hyacinth, so soft and thick that it raised them well above 
<A NAME="279"></A>the ground. Here they laid themselves down and overhead they were covered 
<A NAME="280"></A>by a fair cloud of gold, from which there fell glittering 
<A NAME="281"></A>dew-drops.
<A NAME="282"></A><BR><BR>Thus, then, did the sire of all things repose peacefully on the 
<A NAME="283"></A>crest of Ida, overcome at once by sleep and love, and he held his spouse 
<A NAME="284"></A>in his arms. Meanwhile Sleep made off to the ships of the Achaeans, to 
<A NAME="285"></A>tell earth-encircling Neptune, lord of the earthquake. When he had found 
<A NAME="286"></A>him he said, "Now, Neptune, you can help the Danaans with a will, and give 
<A NAME="287"></A>them victory though it be only for a short time while Jove is still sleeping. 
<A NAME="288"></A>I have sent him into a sweet slumber, and Juno has beguiled him into going 
<A NAME="289"></A>to bed with her."
<A NAME="290"></A><BR><BR>Sleep now departed and went his ways to and fro among mankind, 
<A NAME="291"></A>leaving Neptune more eager than ever to help the Danaans. He darted forward 
<A NAME="292"></A>among the first ranks and shouted saying, "Argives, shall we let Hector 
<A NAME="293"></A>son of Priam have the triumph of taking our ships and covering himself 
<A NAME="294"></A>with glory? This is what he says that he shall now do, seeing that Achilles 
<A NAME="295"></A>is still in dudgeon at his ship; We shall get on very well without him 
<A NAME="296"></A>if we keep each other in heart and stand by one another. Now, therefore, 
<A NAME="297"></A>let us all do as I say. Let us each take the best and largest shield we 
<A NAME="298"></A>can lay hold of, put on our helmets, and sally forth with our longest spears 
<A NAME="299"></A>in our hands; will lead you on, and Hector son of Priam, rage as he may, 
<A NAME="300"></A>will not dare to hold out against us. If any good staunch soldier has only 
<A NAME="301"></A>a small shield, let him hand it over to a worse man, and take a larger 
<A NAME="302"></A>one for himself."
<A NAME="303"></A><BR><BR>Thus did he speak, and they did even as he had said. The son of 
<A NAME="304"></A>Tydeus, Ulysses, and Agamemnon, wounded though they were, set the others 
<A NAME="305"></A>in array, and went about everywhere effecting the exchanges of armour; 
<A NAME="306"></A>the most valiant took the best armour, and gave the worse to the worse 
<A NAME="307"></A>man. When they had donned their bronze armour they marched on with Neptune 
<A NAME="308"></A>at their head. In his strong hand he grasped his terrible sword, keen of 
<A NAME="309"></A>edge and flashing like lightning; woe to him who comes across it in the 
<A NAME="310"></A>day of battle; all men quake for fear and keep away from 
<A NAME="311"></A>it.
<A NAME="312"></A><BR><BR>Hector on the other side set the Trojans in array. Thereon Neptune 
<A NAME="313"></A>and Hector waged fierce war on one another- Hector on the Trojan and Neptune 
<A NAME="314"></A>on the Argive side. Mighty was the uproar as the two forces met; the sea 
<A NAME="315"></A>came rolling in towards the ships and tents of the Achaeans, but waves 
<A NAME="316"></A>do not thunder on the shore more loudly when driven before the blast of 
<A NAME="317"></A>Boreas, nor do the flames of a forest fire roar more fiercely when it is 
<A NAME="318"></A>well alight upon the mountains, nor does the wind bellow with ruder music 
<A NAME="319"></A>as it tears on through the tops of when it is blowing its hardest, than 
<A NAME="320"></A>the terrible shout which the Trojans and Achaeans raised as they sprang 
<A NAME="321"></A>upon one another.
<A NAME="322"></A><BR><BR>Hector first aimed his spear at Ajax, who was turned full towards 
<A NAME="323"></A>him, nor did he miss his aim. The spear struck him where two bands passed 
<A NAME="324"></A>over his chest- the band of his shield and that of his silver-studded sword- 
<A NAME="325"></A>and these protected his body. Hector was angry that his spear should have 
<A NAME="326"></A>been hurled in vain, and withdrew under cover of his men. As he was thus 
<A NAME="327"></A>retreating, Ajax son of Telamon struck him with a stone, of which there 
<A NAME="328"></A>were many lying about under the men's feet as they fought- brought there 
<A NAME="329"></A>to give support to the ships' sides as they lay on the shore. Ajax caught 
<A NAME="330"></A>up one of them and struck Hector above the rim of his shield close to his 
<A NAME="331"></A>neck; the blow made him spin round like a top and reel in all directions. 
<A NAME="332"></A>As an oak falls headlong when uprooted by the lightning flash of father 
<A NAME="333"></A>Jove, and there is a terrible smell of brimstone- no man can help being 
<A NAME="334"></A>dismayed if he is standing near it, for a thunderbolt is a very awful thing- 
<A NAME="335"></A>even so did Hector fall to earth and bite the dust. His spear fell from 
<A NAME="336"></A>his hand, but his shield and helmet were made fast about his body, and 
<A NAME="337"></A>his bronze armour rang about him.
<A NAME="338"></A><BR><BR>The sons of the Achaeans came running with a loud cry towards him, 
<A NAME="339"></A>hoping to drag him away, and they showered their darts on the Trojans, 
<A NAME="340"></A>but none of them could wound him before he was surrounded and covered by 
<A NAME="341"></A>the princes Polydamas, Aeneas, Agenor, Sarpedon captain of the Lycians, 
<A NAME="342"></A>and noble Glaucus: of the others, too, there was not one who was unmindful 
<A NAME="343"></A>of him, and they held their round shields over him to cover him. His comrades 
<A NAME="344"></A>then lifted him off the ground and bore him away from the battle to the 
<A NAME="345"></A>place where his horses stood waiting for him at the rear of the fight with 
<A NAME="346"></A>their driver and the chariot; these then took him towards the city groaning 
<A NAME="347"></A>and in great pain. When they reached the ford of the air stream of Xanthus, 
<A NAME="348"></A>begotten of Immortal Jove, they took him from off his chariot and laid 
<A NAME="349"></A>him down on the ground; they poured water over him, and as they did so 
<A NAME="350"></A>he breathed again and opened his eyes. Then kneeling on his knees he vomited 
<A NAME="351"></A>blood, but soon fell back on to the ground, and his eyes were again closed 
<A NAME="352"></A>in darkness for he was still sturined by the blow.
<A NAME="353"></A><BR><BR>When the Argives saw Hector leaving the field, they took heart 
<A NAME="354"></A>and set upon the Trojans yet more furiously. Ajax fleet son of Oileus began 
<A NAME="355"></A>by springing on Satnius son of Enops and wounding him with his spear: a 
<A NAME="356"></A>fair naiad nymph had borne him to Enops as he was herding cattle by the 
<A NAME="357"></A>banks of the river Satnioeis. The son of Oileus came up to him and struck 
<A NAME="358"></A>him in the flank so that he fell, and a fierce fight between Trojans and 
<A NAME="359"></A>Danaans raged round his body. Polydamas son of Panthous drew near to avenge 
<A NAME="360"></A>him, and wounded Prothoenor son of Areilycus on the right shoulder; the 
<A NAME="361"></A>terrible spear went right through his shoulder, and he clutched the earth 
<A NAME="362"></A>as he fell in the dust. Polydamas vaunted loudly over him saying, "Again 
<A NAME="363"></A>I take it that the spear has not sped in vain from the strong hand of the 
<A NAME="364"></A>son of Panthous; an Argive has caught it in his body, and it will serve 
<A NAME="365"></A>him for a staff as he goes down into the house of Hades."
<A NAME="366"></A><BR><BR>The Argives were maddened by this boasting. Ajax son of Telamon 
<A NAME="367"></A>was more angry than any, for the man had fallen close be, him; so he aimed 
<A NAME="368"></A>at Polydamas as he was retreating, but Polydamas saved himself by swerving 
<A NAME="369"></A>aside and the spear struck Archelochus son of Antenor, for heaven counselled 
<A NAME="370"></A>his destruction; it struck him where the head springs from the neck at 
<A NAME="371"></A>the top joint of the spine, and severed both the tendons at the back of 
<A NAME="372"></A>the head. His head, mouth, and nostrils reached the ground long before 
<A NAME="373"></A>his legs and knees could do so, and Ajax shouted to Polydamas saying, "Think, 
<A NAME="374"></A>Polydamas, and tell me truly whether this man is not as well worth killing 
<A NAME="375"></A>as Prothoenor was: he seems rich, and of rich family, a brother, it may 
<A NAME="376"></A>be, or son of the knight Antenor, for he is very like 
<A NAME="377"></A>him."
<A NAME="378"></A><BR><BR>But he knew well who it was, and the Trojans were greatly angered. 
<A NAME="379"></A>Acamas then bestrode his brother's body and wounded Promachus the Boeotian 
<A NAME="380"></A>with his spear, for he was trying to drag his brother's body away. Acamas 
<A NAME="381"></A>vaunted loudly over him saying, "Argive archers, braggarts that you are, 
<A NAME="382"></A>toil and suffering shall not be for us only, but some of you too shall 
<A NAME="383"></A>fall here as well as ourselves. See how Promachus now sleeps, vanquished 
<A NAME="384"></A>by my spear; payment for my brother's blood has not long delayed; a man, 
<A NAME="385"></A>therefore, may well be thankful if he leaves a kinsman in his house behind 
<A NAME="386"></A>him to avenge his fall."
<A NAME="387"></A><BR><BR>His taunts infuriated the Argives, and Peneleos was more enraged 
<A NAME="388"></A>than any of them. He sprang towards Acamas, but Acamas did not stand his 
<A NAME="389"></A>ground, and he killed Ilioneus son of the rich flock-master Phorbas, whom 
<A NAME="390"></A>Mercury had favoured and endowed with greater wealth than any other of 
<A NAME="391"></A>the Trojans. Ilioneus was his only son, and Peneleos now wounded him in 
<A NAME="392"></A>the eye under his eyebrows, tearing the eye-ball from its socket: the spear 
<A NAME="393"></A>went right through the eye into the nape of the neck, and he fell, stretching 
<A NAME="394"></A>out both hands before him. Peneleos then drew his sword and smote him on 
<A NAME="395"></A>the neck, so that both head and helmet came tumbling down to the ground 
<A NAME="396"></A>with the spear still sticking in the eye; he then held up the head, as 
<A NAME="397"></A>though it had been a poppy-head, and showed it to the Trojans, vaunting 
<A NAME="398"></A>over them as he did so. "Trojans," he cried, "bid the father and mother 
<A NAME="399"></A>of noble Ilioneus make moan for him in their house, for the wife also of 
<A NAME="400"></A>Promachus son of Alegenor will never be gladdened by the coming of her 
<A NAME="401"></A>dear husband- when we Argives return with our ships from 
<A NAME="402"></A>Troy."
<A NAME="403"></A><BR><BR>As he spoke fear fell upon them, and every man looked round about 
<A NAME="404"></A>to see whither he might fly for safety.
<A NAME="405"></A><BR><BR>Tell me now, O Muses that dwell on Olympus, who was the first of 
<A NAME="406"></A>the Argives to bear away blood-stained spoils after Neptune lord of the 
<A NAME="407"></A>earthquake had turned the fortune of war. Ajax son of Telamon was first 
<A NAME="408"></A>to wound Hyrtius son of Gyrtius, captain of the staunch Mysians. Antilochus 
<A NAME="409"></A>killed Phalces and Mermerus, while Meriones slew Morys and Hippotion, Teucer 
<A NAME="410"></A>also killed Prothoon and Periphetes. The son of Atreus then wounded Hyperenor 
<A NAME="411"></A>shepherd of his people, in the flank, and the bronze point made his entrails 
<A NAME="412"></A>gush out as it tore in among them; on this his life came hurrying out of 
<A NAME="413"></A>him at the place where he had been wounded, and his eyes were closed in 
<A NAME="414"></A>darkness. Ajax son of Oileus killed more than any other, for there was 
<A NAME="415"></A>no man so fleet as he to pursue flying foes when Jove had spread panic 
<A NAME="416"></A>among them.
