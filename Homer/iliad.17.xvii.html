<A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A>Brave Menelaus son of Atreus now came to know that Patroclus had fallen, 
<A NAME="11"></A>and made his way through the front ranks clad in full armour to bestride 
<A NAME="12"></A>him. As a cow stands lowing over her first calf, even so did yellow-haired 
<A NAME="13"></A>Menelaus bestride Patroclus. He held his round shield and his spear in 
<A NAME="14"></A>front of him, resolute to kill any who should dare face him. But the son 
<A NAME="15"></A>of Panthous had also noted the body, and came up to Menelaus saying, "Menelaus, 
<A NAME="16"></A>son of Atreus, draw back, leave the body, and let the bloodstained spoils 
<A NAME="17"></A>be. I was first of the Trojans and their brave allies to drive my spear 
<A NAME="18"></A>into Patroclus, let me, therefore, have my full glory among the Trojans, 
<A NAME="19"></A>or I will take aim and kill you."
<A NAME="20"></A><BR><BR>To this Menelaus answered in great anger "By father Jove, boasting 
<A NAME="21"></A>is an ill thing. The pard is not more bold, nor the lion nor savage wild-boar, 
<A NAME="22"></A>which is fiercest and most dauntless of all creatures, than are the proud 
<A NAME="23"></A>sons of Panthous. Yet Hyperenor did not see out the days of his youth when 
<A NAME="24"></A>he made light of me and withstood me, deeming me the meanest soldier among 
<A NAME="25"></A>the Danaans. His own feet never bore him back to gladden his wife and parents. 
<A NAME="26"></A>Even so shall I make an end of you too, if you withstand me; get you back 
<A NAME="27"></A>into the crowd and do not face me, or it shall be worse for you. Even a 
<A NAME="28"></A>fool may be wise after the event."
<A NAME="29"></A><BR><BR>Euphorbus would not listen, and said, "Now indeed, Menelaus, shall 
<A NAME="30"></A>you pay for the death of my brother over whom you vaunted, and whose wife 
<A NAME="31"></A>you widowed in her bridal chamber, while you brought grief unspeakable 
<A NAME="32"></A>on his parents. I shall comfort these poor people if I bring your head 
<A NAME="33"></A>and armour and place them in the hands of Panthous and noble Phrontis. 
<A NAME="34"></A>The time is come when this matter shall be fought out and settled, for 
<A NAME="35"></A>me or against me."
<A NAME="36"></A><BR><BR>As he spoke he struck Menelaus full on the shield, but the spear 
<A NAME="37"></A>did not go through, for the shield turned its point. Menelaus then took 
<A NAME="38"></A>aim, praying to father Jove as he did so; Euphorbus was drawing back, and 
<A NAME="39"></A>Menelaus struck him about the roots of his throat, leaning his whole weight 
<A NAME="40"></A>on the spear, so as to drive it home. The point went clean through his 
<A NAME="41"></A>neck, and his armour rang rattling round him as he fell heavily to the 
<A NAME="42"></A>ground. His hair which was like that of the Graces, and his locks so deftly 
<A NAME="43"></A>bound in bands of silver and gold, were all bedrabbled with blood. As one 
<A NAME="44"></A>who has grown a fine young olive tree in a clear space where there is abundance 
<A NAME="45"></A>of water- the plant is full of promise, and though the winds beat upon 
<A NAME="46"></A>it from every quarter it puts forth its white blossoms till the blasts 
<A NAME="47"></A>of some fierce hurricane sweep down upon it and level it with the ground- 
<A NAME="48"></A>even so did Menelaus strip the fair youth Euphorbus of his armour after 
<A NAME="49"></A>he had slain him. Or as some fierce lion upon the mountains in the pride 
<A NAME="50"></A>of his strength fastens on the finest heifer in a herd as it is feeding- 
<A NAME="51"></A>first he breaks her neck with his strong jaws, and then gorges on her blood 
<A NAME="52"></A>and entrails; dogs and shepherds raise a hue and cry against him, but they 
<A NAME="53"></A>stand aloof and will not come close to him, for they are pale with fear- 
<A NAME="54"></A>even so no one had the courage to face valiant Menelaus. The son of Atreus 
<A NAME="55"></A>would have then carried off the armour of the son of Panthous with ease, 
<A NAME="56"></A>had not Phoebus Apollo been angry, and in the guise of Mentes chief of 
<A NAME="57"></A>the Cicons incited Hector to attack him. "Hector," said he, "you are now 
<A NAME="58"></A>going after the horses of the noble son of Aeacus, but you will not take 
<A NAME="59"></A>them; they cannot be kept in hand and driven by mortal man, save only by 
<A NAME="60"></A>Achilles, who is son to an immortal mother. Meanwhile Menelaus son of Atreus 
<A NAME="61"></A>has bestridden the body of Patroclus and killed the noblest of the Trojans, 
<A NAME="62"></A>Euphorbus son of Panthous, so that he can fight no more."
<A NAME="63"></A><BR><BR>The god then went back into the toil and turmoil, but the soul 
<A NAME="64"></A>of Hector was darkened with a cloud of grief; he looked along the ranks 
<A NAME="65"></A>and saw Euphorbus lying on the ground with the blood still flowing from 
<A NAME="66"></A>his wound, and Menelaus stripping him of his armour. On this he made his 
<A NAME="67"></A>way to the front like a flame of fire, clad in his gleaming armour, and 
<A NAME="68"></A>crying with a loud voice. When the son of Atreus heard him, he said to 
<A NAME="69"></A>himself in his dismay, "Alas! what shall I do? I may not let the Trojans 
<A NAME="70"></A>take the armour of Patroclus who has fallen fighting on my behalf, lest 
<A NAME="71"></A>some Danaan who sees me should cry shame upon me. Still if for my honour's 
<A NAME="72"></A>sake I fight Hector and the Trojans single-handed, they will prove too 
<A NAME="73"></A>many for me, for Hector is bringing them up in force. Why, however, should 
<A NAME="74"></A>I thus hesitate? When a man fights in despite of heaven with one whom a 
<A NAME="75"></A>god befriends, he will soon rue it. Let no Danaan think ill of me if I 
<A NAME="76"></A>give place to Hector, for the hand of heaven is with him. Yet, if I could 
<A NAME="77"></A>find Ajax, the two of us would fight Hector and heaven too, if we might 
<A NAME="78"></A>only save the body of Patroclus for Achilles son of Peleus. This, of many 
<A NAME="79"></A>evils would be the least."
<A NAME="80"></A><BR><BR>While he was thus in two minds, the Trojans came up to him with 
<A NAME="81"></A>Hector at their head; he therefore drew back and left the body, turning 
<A NAME="82"></A>about like some bearded lion who is being chased by dogs and men from a 
<A NAME="83"></A>stockyard with spears and hue and cry, whereon he is daunted and slinks 
<A NAME="84"></A>sulkily off- even so did Menelaus son of Atreus turn and leave the body 
<A NAME="85"></A>of Patroclus. When among the body of his men, he looked around for mighty 
<A NAME="86"></A>Ajax son of Telamon, and presently saw him on the extreme left of the fight, 
<A NAME="87"></A>cheering on his men and exhorting them to keep on fighting, for Phoebus 
<A NAME="88"></A>Apollo had spread a great panic among them. He ran up to him and said, 
<A NAME="89"></A>"Ajax, my good friend, come with me at once to dead Patroclus, if so be 
<A NAME="90"></A>that we may take the body to Achilles- as for his armour, Hector already 
<A NAME="91"></A>has it."
<A NAME="92"></A><BR><BR>These words stirred the heart of Ajax, and he made his way among 
<A NAME="93"></A>the front ranks, Menelaus going with him. Hector had stripped Patroclus 
<A NAME="94"></A>of his armour, and was dragging him away to cut off his head and take the 
<A NAME="95"></A>body to fling before the dogs of Troy. But Ajax came up with his shield 
<A NAME="96"></A>like wall before him, on which Hector withdrew under shelter of his men, 
<A NAME="97"></A>and sprang on to his chariot, giving the armour over to the Trojans to 
<A NAME="98"></A>take to the city, as a great trophy for himself; Ajax, therefore, covered 
<A NAME="99"></A>the body of Patroclus with his broad shield and bestrode him; as a lion 
<A NAME="100"></A>stands over his whelps if hunters have come upon him in a forest when he 
<A NAME="101"></A>is with his little ones- in the pride and fierceness of his strength he 
<A NAME="102"></A>draws his knit brows down till they cover his eyes- even so did Ajax bestride 
<A NAME="103"></A>the body of Patroclus, and by his side stood Menelaus son of Atreus, nursing 
<A NAME="104"></A>great sorrow in his heart.
<A NAME="105"></A><BR><BR>Then Glaucus son of Hippolochus looked fiercely at Hector and rebuked 
<A NAME="106"></A>him sternly. "Hector," said he, "you make a brave show, but in fight you 
<A NAME="107"></A>are sadly wanting. A runaway like yourself has no claim to so great a reputation. 
<A NAME="108"></A>Think how you may now save your town and citadel by the hands of your own 
<A NAME="109"></A>people born in Ilius; for you will get no Lycians to fight for you, seeing 
<A NAME="110"></A>what thanks they have had for their incessant hardships. Are you likely, 
<A NAME="111"></A>sir, to do anything to help a man of less note, after leaving Sarpedon, 
<A NAME="112"></A>who was at once your guest and comrade in arms, to be the spoil and prey 
<A NAME="113"></A>of the Danaans? So long as he lived he did good service both to your city 
<A NAME="114"></A>and yourself; yet you had no stomach to save his body from the dogs. If 
<A NAME="115"></A>the Lycians will listen to me, they will go home and leave Troy to its 
<A NAME="116"></A>fate. If the Trojans had any of that daring fearless spirit which lays 
<A NAME="117"></A>hold of men who are fighting for their country and harassing those who 
<A NAME="118"></A>would attack it, we should soon bear off Patroclus into Ilius. Could we 
<A NAME="119"></A>get this dead man away and bring him into the city of Priam, the Argives 
<A NAME="120"></A>would readily give up the armour of Sarpedon, and we should get his body 
<A NAME="121"></A>to boot. For he whose squire has been now killed is the foremost man at 
<A NAME="122"></A>the ships of the Achaeans- he and his close-fighting followers. Nevertheless 
<A NAME="123"></A>you dared not make a stand against Ajax, nor face him, eye to eye, with 
<A NAME="124"></A>battle all round you, for he is a braver man than you 
<A NAME="125"></A>are."
<A NAME="126"></A><BR><BR>Hector scowled at him and answered, "Glaucus, you should know better. 
<A NAME="127"></A>I have held you so far as a man of more understanding than any in all Lycia, 
<A NAME="128"></A>but now I despise you for saying that I am afraid of Ajax. I fear neither 
<A NAME="129"></A>battle nor the din of chariots, but Jove's will is stronger than ours; 
<A NAME="130"></A>Jove at one time makes even a strong man draw back and snatches victory 
<A NAME="131"></A>from his grasp, while at another he will set him on to fight. Come hither 
<A NAME="132"></A>then, my friend, stand by me and see indeed whether I shall play the coward 
<A NAME="133"></A>the whole day through as you say, or whether I shall not stay some even 
<A NAME="134"></A>of the boldest Danaans from fighting round the body of 
<A NAME="135"></A>Patroclus."
<A NAME="136"></A><BR><BR>As he spoke he called loudly on the Trojans saying, "Trojans, Lycians, 
<A NAME="137"></A>and Dardanians, fighters in close combat, be men, my friends, and fight 
<A NAME="138"></A>might and main, while I put on the goodly armour of Achilles, which I took 
<A NAME="139"></A>when I killed Patroclus."
<A NAME="140"></A><BR><BR>With this Hector left the fight, and ran full speed after his men 
<A NAME="141"></A>who were taking the armour of Achilles to Troy, but had not yet got far. 
<A NAME="142"></A>Standing for a while apart from the woeful fight, he changed his armour. 
<A NAME="143"></A>His own he sent to the strong city of Ilius and to the Trojans, while he 
<A NAME="144"></A>put on the immortal armour of the son of Peleus, which the gods had given 
<A NAME="145"></A>to Peleus, who in his age gave it to his son; but the son did not grow 
<A NAME="146"></A>old in his father's armour.
<A NAME="147"></A><BR><BR>When Jove, lord of the storm-cloud, saw Hector standing aloof and 
<A NAME="148"></A>arming himself in the armour of the son of Peleus, he wagged his head and 
<A NAME="149"></A>muttered to himself saying, "A! poor wretch, you arm in the armour of a 
<A NAME="150"></A>hero, before whom many another trembles, and you reck nothing of the doom 
<A NAME="151"></A>that is already close upon you. You have killed his comrade so brave and 
<A NAME="152"></A>strong, but it was not well that you should strip the armour from his head 
<A NAME="153"></A>and shoulders. I do indeed endow you with great might now, but as against 
<A NAME="154"></A>this you shall not return from battle to lay the armour of the son of Peleus 
<A NAME="155"></A>before Andromache."
<A NAME="156"></A><BR><BR>The son of Saturn bowed his portentous brows, and Hector fitted 
<A NAME="157"></A>the armour to his body, while terrible Mars entered into him, and filled 
<A NAME="158"></A>his whole body with might and valour. With a shout he strode in among the 
<A NAME="159"></A>allies, and his armour flashed about him so that he seemed to all of them 
<A NAME="160"></A>like the great son of Peleus himself. He went about among them and cheered 
<A NAME="161"></A>them on- Mesthles, Glaucus, Medon, Thersilochus, Asteropaeus, Deisenor 
<A NAME="162"></A>and Hippothous, Phorcys, Chromius and Ennomus the augur. All these did 
<A NAME="163"></A>he exhort saying, "Hear me, allies from other cities who are here in your 
<A NAME="164"></A>thousands, it was not in order to have a crowd about me that I called you 
<A NAME="165"></A>hither each from his several city, but that with heart and soul you might 
<A NAME="166"></A>defend the wives and little ones of the Trojans from the fierce Achaeans. 
<A NAME="167"></A>For this do I oppress my people with your food and the presents that make 
<A NAME="168"></A>you rich. Therefore turn, and charge at the foe, to stand or fall as is 
<A NAME="169"></A>the game of war; whoever shall bring Patroclus, dead though he be, into 
<A NAME="170"></A>the hands of the Trojans, and shall make Ajax give way before him, I will 
<A NAME="171"></A>give him one half of the spoils while I keep the other. He will thus share 
<A NAME="172"></A>like honour with myself."
<A NAME="173"></A><BR><BR>When he had thus spoken they charged full weight upon the Danaans 
<A NAME="174"></A>with their spears held out before them, and the hopes of each ran high 
<A NAME="175"></A>that he should force Ajax son of Telamon to yield up the body- fools that 
<A NAME="176"></A>they were, for he was about to take the lives of many. Then Ajax said to 
<A NAME="177"></A>Menelaus, "My good friend Menelaus, you and I shall hardly come out of 
<A NAME="178"></A>this fight alive. I am less concerned for the body of Patroclus, who will 
<A NAME="179"></A>shortly become meat for the dogs and vultures of Troy, than for the safety 
<A NAME="180"></A>of my own head and yours. Hector has wrapped us round in a storm of battle 
<A NAME="181"></A>from every quarter, and our destruction seems now certain. Call then upon 
<A NAME="182"></A>the princes of the Danaans if there is any who can hear 
<A NAME="183"></A>us."
<A NAME="184"></A><BR><BR>Menelaus did as he said, and shouted to the Danaans for help at 
<A NAME="185"></A>the top of his voice. "My friends," he cried, "princes and counsellors 
<A NAME="186"></A>of the Argives, all you who with Agamemnon and Menelaus drink at the public 
<A NAME="187"></A>cost, and give orders each to his own people as Jove vouchsafes him power 
<A NAME="188"></A>and glory, the fight is so thick about me that I cannot distinguish you 
<A NAME="189"></A>severally; come on, therefore, every man unbidden, and think it shame that 
<A NAME="190"></A>Patroclus should become meat and morsel for Trojan hounds."
<A NAME="191"></A><BR><BR>Fleet Ajax son of Oileus heard him and was first to force his way 
<A NAME="192"></A>through the fight and run to help him. Next came Idomeneus and Meriones 
<A NAME="193"></A>his esquire, peer of murderous Mars. As for the others that came into the 
<A NAME="194"></A>fight after these, who of his own self could name them?
<A NAME="195"></A><BR><BR>The Trojans with Hector at their head charged in a body. As a great 
<A NAME="196"></A>wave that comes thundering in at the mouth of some heaven-born river, and 
<A NAME="197"></A>the rocks that jut into the sea ring with the roar of the breakers that 
<A NAME="198"></A>beat and buffet them- even with such a roar did the Trojans come on; but 
<A NAME="199"></A>the Achaeans in singleness of heart stood firm about the son of Menoetius, 
<A NAME="200"></A>and fenced him with their bronze shields. Jove, moreover, hid the brightness 
<A NAME="201"></A>of their helmets in a thick cloud, for he had borne no grudge against the 
<A NAME="202"></A>son of Menoetius while he was still alive and squire to the descendant 
<A NAME="203"></A>of Aeacus; therefore he was loth to let him fall a prey to the dogs of 
<A NAME="204"></A>his foes the Trojans, and urged his comrades on to defend 
<A NAME="205"></A>him.
<A NAME="206"></A><BR><BR>At first the Trojans drove the Achaeans back, and they withdrew 
<A NAME="207"></A>from the dead man daunted. The Trojans did not succeed in killing any one, 
<A NAME="208"></A>nevertheless they drew the body away. But the Achaeans did not lose it 
<A NAME="209"></A>long, for Ajax, foremost of all the Danaans after the son of Peleus alike 
<A NAME="210"></A>in stature and prowess, quickly rallied them and made towards the front 
<A NAME="211"></A>like a wild boar upon the mountains when he stands at bay in the forest 
<A NAME="212"></A>glades and routs the hounds and lusty youths that have attacked him- even 
<A NAME="213"></A>so did Ajax son of Telamon passing easily in among the phalanxes of the 
<A NAME="214"></A>Trojans, disperse those who had bestridden Patroclus and were most bent 
<A NAME="215"></A>on winning glory by dragging him off to their city. At this moment Hippothous 
<A NAME="216"></A>brave son of the Pelasgian Lethus, in his zeal for Hector and the Trojans, 
<A NAME="217"></A>was dragging the body off by the foot through the press of the fight, having 
<A NAME="218"></A>bound a strap round the sinews near the ancle; but a mischief soon befell 
<A NAME="219"></A>him from which none of those could save him who would have gladly done 
<A NAME="220"></A>so, for the son of Telamon sprang forward and smote him on his bronze-cheeked 
<A NAME="221"></A>helmet. The plumed headpiece broke about the point of the weapon, struck 
<A NAME="222"></A>at once by the spear and by the strong hand of Ajax, so that the bloody 
<A NAME="223"></A>brain came oozing out through the crest-socket. His strength then failed 
<A NAME="224"></A>him and he let Patroclus' foot drop from his hand, as he fell full length 
<A NAME="225"></A>dead upon the body; thus he died far from the fertile land of Larissa, 
<A NAME="226"></A>and never repaid his parents the cost of bringing him up, for his life 
<A NAME="227"></A>was cut short early by the spear of mighty Ajax. Hector then took aim at 
<A NAME="228"></A>Ajax with a spear, but he saw it coming and just managed to avoid it; the 
<A NAME="229"></A>spear passed on and struck Schedius son of noble Iphitus, captain of the 
<A NAME="230"></A>Phoceans, who dwelt in famed Panopeus and reigned over much people; it 
<A NAME="231"></A>struck him under the middle of the collar-bone the bronze point went right 
<A NAME="232"></A>through him, coming out at the bottom of his shoulder-blade, and his armour 
<A NAME="233"></A>rang rattling round him as he fell heavily to the ground. Ajax in his turn 
<A NAME="234"></A>struck noble Phorcys son of Phaenops in the middle of the belly as he was 
<A NAME="235"></A>bestriding Hippothous, and broke the plate of his cuirass; whereon the 
<A NAME="236"></A>spear tore out his entrails and he clutched the ground in his palm as he 
<A NAME="237"></A>fell to earth. Hector and those who were in the front rank then gave ground, 
<A NAME="238"></A>while the Argives raised a loud cry of triumph, and drew off the bodies 
<A NAME="239"></A>of Phorcys and Hippothous which they stripped presently of their 
<A NAME="240"></A>armour.
<A NAME="241"></A><BR><BR>The Trojans would now have been worsted by the brave Achaeans and 
<A NAME="242"></A>driven back to Ilius through their own cowardice, while the Argives, so 
<A NAME="243"></A>great was their courage and endurance, would have achieved a triumph even 
<A NAME="244"></A>against the will of Jove, if Apollo had not roused Aeneas, in the likeness 
<A NAME="245"></A>of Periphas son of Epytus, an attendant who had grown old in the service 
<A NAME="246"></A>of Aeneas' aged father, and was at all times devoted to him. In his likeness, 
<A NAME="247"></A>then, Apollo said, "Aeneas, can you not manage, even though heaven be against 
<A NAME="248"></A>us, to save high Ilius? I have known men, whose numbers, courage, and self-reliance 
<A NAME="249"></A>have saved their people in spite of Jove, whereas in this case he would 
<A NAME="250"></A>much rather give victory to us than to the Danaans, if you would only fight 
<A NAME="251"></A>instead of being so terribly afraid."
<A NAME="252"></A><BR><BR>Aeneas knew Apollo when he looked straight at him, and shouted 
<A NAME="253"></A>to Hector saying, "Hector and all other Trojans and allies, shame on us 
<A NAME="254"></A>if we are beaten by the Achaeans and driven back to Ilius through our own 
<A NAME="255"></A>cowardice. A god has just come up to me and told me that Jove the supreme 
<A NAME="256"></A>disposer will be with us. Therefore let us make for the Danaans, that it 
<A NAME="257"></A>may go hard with them ere they bear away dead Patroclus to the 
<A NAME="258"></A>ships."
<A NAME="259"></A><BR><BR>As he spoke he sprang out far in front of the others, who then 
<A NAME="260"></A>rallied and again faced the Achaeans. Aeneas speared Leiocritus son of 
<A NAME="261"></A>Arisbas, a valiant follower of Lycomedes, and Lycomedes was moved with 
<A NAME="262"></A>pity as he saw him fall; he therefore went close up, and speared Apisaon 
<A NAME="263"></A>son of Hippasus shepherd of his people in the liver under the midriff, 
<A NAME="264"></A>so that he died; he had come from fertile Paeonia and was the best man 
<A NAME="265"></A>of them all after Asteropaeus. Asteropaeus flew forward to avenge him and 
<A NAME="266"></A>attack the Danaans, but this might no longer be, inasmuch as those about 
<A NAME="267"></A>Patroclus were well covered by their shields, and held their spears in 
<A NAME="268"></A>front of them, for Ajax had given them strict orders that no man was either 
<A NAME="269"></A>to give ground, or to stand out before the others, but all were to hold 
<A NAME="270"></A>well together about the body and fight hand to hand. Thus did huge Ajax 
<A NAME="271"></A>bid them, and the earth ran red with blood as the corpses fell thick on 
<A NAME="272"></A>one another alike on the side of the Trojans and allies, and on that of 
<A NAME="273"></A>the Danaans; for these last, too, fought no bloodless fight though many 
<A NAME="274"></A>fewer of them perished, through the care they took to defend and stand 
<A NAME="275"></A>by one another.
<A NAME="276"></A><BR><BR>Thus did they fight as it were a flaming fire; it seemed as though 
<A NAME="277"></A>it had gone hard even with the sun and moon, for they were hidden over 
<A NAME="278"></A>all that part where the bravest heroes were fighting about the dead son 
<A NAME="279"></A>of Menoetius, whereas the other Danaans and Achaeans fought at their ease 
<A NAME="280"></A>in full daylight with brilliant sunshine all round them, and there was 
<A NAME="281"></A>not a cloud to be seen neither on plain nor mountain. These last moreover 
<A NAME="282"></A>would rest for a while and leave off fighting, for they were some distance 
<A NAME="283"></A>apart and beyond the range of one another's weapons, whereas those who 
<A NAME="284"></A>were in the thick of the fray suffered both from battle and darkness. All 
<A NAME="285"></A>the best of them were being worn out by the great weight of their armour, 
<A NAME="286"></A>but the two valiant heroes, Thrasymedes and Antilochus, had not yet heard 
<A NAME="287"></A>of the death of Patroclus, and believed him to be still alive and leading 
<A NAME="288"></A>the van against the Trojans; they were keeping themselves in reserve against 
<A NAME="289"></A>the death or rout of their own comrades, for so Nestor had ordered when 
<A NAME="290"></A>he sent them from the ships into battle.
<A NAME="291"></A><BR><BR>Thus through the livelong day did they wage fierce war, and the 
<A NAME="292"></A>sweat of their toil rained ever on their legs under them, and on their 
<A NAME="293"></A>hands and eyes, as they fought over the squire of the fleet son of Peleus. 
<A NAME="294"></A>It was as when a man gives a great ox-hide all drenched in fat to his men, 
<A NAME="295"></A>and bids them stretch it; whereon they stand round it in a ring and tug 
<A NAME="296"></A>till the moisture leaves it, and the fat soaks in for the many that pull 
<A NAME="297"></A>at it, and it is well stretched- even so did the two sides tug the dead 
<A NAME="298"></A>body hither and thither within the compass of but a little space- the Trojans 
<A NAME="299"></A>steadfastly set on drag ing it into Ilius, while the Achaeans were no less 
<A NAME="300"></A>so on taking it to their ships; and fierce was the fight between them. 
<A NAME="301"></A>Not Mars himself the lord of hosts, nor yet Minerva, even in their fullest 
<A NAME="302"></A>fury could make light of such a battle.
<A NAME="303"></A><BR><BR>Such fearful turmoil of men and horses did Jove on that day ordain 
<A NAME="304"></A>round the body of Patroclus. Meanwhile Achilles did not know that he had 
<A NAME="305"></A>fallen, for the fight was under the wall of Troy a long way off the ships. 
<A NAME="306"></A>He had no idea, therefore, that Patroclus was dead, and deemed that he 
<A NAME="307"></A>would return alive as soon as he had gone close up to the gates. He knew 
<A NAME="308"></A>that he was not to sack the city neither with nor without himself, for 
<A NAME="309"></A>his mother had often told him this when he had sat alone with her, and 
<A NAME="310"></A>she had informed him of the counsels of great Jove. Now, however, she had 
<A NAME="311"></A>not told him how great a disaster had befallen him in the death of the 
<A NAME="312"></A>one who was far dearest to him of all his comrades.
<A NAME="313"></A><BR><BR>The others still kept on charging one another round the body with 
<A NAME="314"></A>their pointed spears and killing each other. Then would one say, "My friends, 
<A NAME="315"></A>we can never again show our faces at the ships- better, and greatly better, 
<A NAME="316"></A>that earth should open and swallow us here in this place, than that we 
<A NAME="317"></A>should let the Trojans have the triumph of bearing off Patroclus to their 
<A NAME="318"></A>city."
<A NAME="319"></A><BR><BR>The Trojans also on their part spoke to one another saying, "Friends, 
<A NAME="320"></A>though we fall to a man beside this body, let none shrink from fighting." 
<A NAME="321"></A>With such words did they exhort each other. They fought and fought, and 
<A NAME="322"></A>an iron clank rose through the void air to the brazen vault of heaven. 
<A NAME="323"></A>The horses of the descendant of Aeacus stood out of the fight and wept 
<A NAME="324"></A>when they heard that their driver had been laid low by the hand of murderous 
<A NAME="325"></A>Hector. Automedon, valiant son of Diores, lashed them again and again; 
<A NAME="326"></A>many a time did he speak kindly to them, and many a time did he upbraid 
<A NAME="327"></A>them, but they would neither go back to the ships by the waters of the 
<A NAME="328"></A>broad Hellespont, nor yet into battle among the Achaeans; they stood with 
<A NAME="329"></A>their chariot stock still, as a pillar set over the tomb of some dead man 
<A NAME="330"></A>or woman, and bowed their heads to the ground. Hot tears fell from their 
<A NAME="331"></A>eyes as they mourned the loss of their charioteer, and their noble manes 
<A NAME="332"></A>drooped all wet from under the yokestraps on either side the 
<A NAME="333"></A>yoke.
<A NAME="334"></A><BR><BR>The son of Saturn saw them and took pity upon their sorrow. He 
<A NAME="335"></A>wagged his head, and muttered to himself, saying, "Poor things, why did 
<A NAME="336"></A>we give you to King Peleus who is a mortal, while you are yourselves ageless 
<A NAME="337"></A>and immortal? Was it that you might share the sorrows that befall mankind? 
<A NAME="338"></A>for of all creatures that live and move upon the earth there is none so 
<A NAME="339"></A>pitiable as he is- still, Hector son of Priam shall drive neither you nor 
<A NAME="340"></A>your chariot. I will not have it. It is enough that he should have the 
<A NAME="341"></A>armour over which he vaunts so vainly. Furthermore I will give you strength 
<A NAME="342"></A>of heart and limb to bear Automedon safely to the ships from battle, for 
<A NAME="343"></A>I shall let the Trojans triumph still further, and go on killing till they 
<A NAME="344"></A>reach the ships; whereon night shall fall and darkness overshadow the 
<A NAME="345"></A>land."
<A NAME="346"></A><BR><BR>As he spoke he breathed heart and strength into the horses so that 
<A NAME="347"></A>they shook the dust from out of their manes, and bore their chariot swiftly 
<A NAME="348"></A>into the fight that raged between Trojans and Achaeans. Behind them fought 
<A NAME="349"></A>Automedon full of sorrow for his comrade, as a vulture amid a flock of 
<A NAME="350"></A>geese. In and out, and here and there, full speed he dashed amid the throng 
<A NAME="351"></A>of the Trojans, but for all the fury of his pursuit he killed no man, for 
<A NAME="352"></A>he could not wield his spear and keep his horses in hand when alone in 
<A NAME="353"></A>the chariot; at last, however, a comrade, Alcimedon, son of Laerces son 
<A NAME="354"></A>of Haemon caught sight of him and came up behind his chariot. "Automedon," 
<A NAME="355"></A>said he, "what god has put this folly into your heart and robbed you of 
<A NAME="356"></A>your right mind, that you fight the Trojans in the front rank single-handed? 
<A NAME="357"></A>He who was your comrade is slain, and Hector plumes himself on being armed 
<A NAME="358"></A>in the armour of the descendant of Aeacus."
<A NAME="359"></A><BR><BR>Automedon son of Diores answered, "Alcimedon, there is no one else 
<A NAME="360"></A>who can control and guide the immortal steeds so well as you can, save 
<A NAME="361"></A>only Patroclus- while he was alive- peer of gods in counsel. Take then 
<A NAME="362"></A>the whip and reins, while I go down from the car and 
<A NAME="363"></A>fight.
<A NAME="364"></A><BR><BR>Alcimedon sprang on to the chariot, and caught up the whip and 
<A NAME="365"></A>reins, while Automedon leaped from off the car. When Hector saw him he 
<A NAME="366"></A>said to Aeneas who was near him, "Aeneas, counsellor of the mail-clad Trojans, 
<A NAME="367"></A>I see the steeds of the fleet son of Aeacus come into battle with weak 
<A NAME="368"></A>hands to drive them. I am sure, if you think well, that we might take them; 
<A NAME="369"></A>they will not dare face us if we both attack them."
<A NAME="370"></A><BR><BR>The valiant son of Anchises was of the same mind, and the pair 
<A NAME="371"></A>went right on, with their shoulders covered under shields of tough dry 
<A NAME="372"></A>ox-hide, overlaid with much bronze. Chromius and Aretus went also with 
<A NAME="373"></A>them, and their hearts beat high with hope that they might kill the men 
<A NAME="374"></A>and capture the horses- fools that they were, for they were not to return 
<A NAME="375"></A>scatheless from their meeting with Automedon, who prayed to father Jove 
<A NAME="376"></A>and was forthwith filled with courage and strength abounding. He turned 
<A NAME="377"></A>to his trusty comrade Alcimedon and said, "Alcimedon, keep your horses 
<A NAME="378"></A>so close up that I may feel their breath upon my back; I doubt that we 
<A NAME="379"></A>shall not stay Hector son of Priam till he has killed us and mounted behind 
<A NAME="380"></A>the horses; he will then either spread panic among the ranks of the Achaeans, 
<A NAME="381"></A>or himself be killed among the foremost."
<A NAME="382"></A><BR><BR>On this he cried out to the two Ajaxes and Menelaus, "Ajaxes captains 
<A NAME="383"></A>of the Argives, and Menelaus, give the dead body over to them that are 
<A NAME="384"></A>best able to defend it, and come to the rescue of us living; for Hector 
<A NAME="385"></A>and Aeneas who are the two best men among the Trojans, are pressing us 
<A NAME="386"></A>hard in the full tide of war. Nevertheless the issue lies on the lap of 
<A NAME="387"></A>heaven, I will therefore hurl my spear and leave the rest to 
<A NAME="388"></A>Jove."
<A NAME="389"></A><BR><BR>He poised and hurled as he spoke, whereon the spear struck the 
<A NAME="390"></A>round shield of Aretus, and went right through it for the shield stayed 
<A NAME="391"></A>it not, so that it was driven through his belt into the lower part of his 
<A NAME="392"></A>belly. As when some sturdy youth, axe in hand, deals his blow behind the 
<A NAME="393"></A>horns of an ox and severs the tendons at the back of its neck so that it 
<A NAME="394"></A>springs forward and then drops, even so did Aretus give one bound and then 
<A NAME="395"></A>fall on his back the spear quivering in his body till it made an end of 
<A NAME="396"></A>him. Hector then aimed a spear at Automedon but he saw it coming and stooped 
<A NAME="397"></A>forward to avoid it, so that it flew past him and the point stuck in the 
<A NAME="398"></A>ground, while the butt-end went on quivering till Mars robbed it of its 
<A NAME="399"></A>force. They would then have fought hand to hand with swords had not the 
<A NAME="400"></A>two Ajaxes forced their way through the crowd when they heard their comrade 
<A NAME="401"></A>calling, and parted them for all their fury- for Hector, Aeneas, and Chromius 
<A NAME="402"></A>were afraid and drew back, leaving Aretus to lie there struck to the heart. 
<A NAME="403"></A>Automedon, peer of fleet Mars, then stripped him of his armour and vaunted 
<A NAME="404"></A>over him saying, "I have done little to assuage my sorrow for the son of 
<A NAME="405"></A>Menoetius, for the man I have killed is not so good as he 
<A NAME="406"></A>was."
<A NAME="407"></A><BR><BR>As he spoke he took the blood-stained spoils and laid them upon 
<A NAME="408"></A>his chariot; then he mounted the car with his hands and feet all steeped 
<A NAME="409"></A>in gore as a lion that has been gorging upon a bull.
<A NAME="410"></A><BR><BR>And now the fierce groanful fight again raged about Patroclus, 
<A NAME="411"></A>for Minerva came down from heaven and roused its fury by the command of 
<A NAME="412"></A>far-seeing Jove, who had changed his mind and sent her to encourage the 
<A NAME="413"></A>Danaans. As when Jove bends his bright bow in heaven in token to mankind 
<A NAME="414"></A>either of war or of the chill storms that stay men from their labour and 
<A NAME="415"></A>plague the flocks- even so, wrapped in such radiant raiment, did Minerva 
<A NAME="416"></A>go in among the host and speak man by man to each. First she took the form 
<A NAME="417"></A>and voice of Phoenix and spoke to Menelaus son of Atreus, who was standing 
<A NAME="418"></A>near her. "Menelaus," said she, "it will be shame and dishonour to you, 
<A NAME="419"></A>if dogs tear the noble comrade of Achilles under the walls of Troy. Therefore 
<A NAME="420"></A>be staunch, and urge your men to be so also."
<A NAME="421"></A><BR><BR>Menelaus answered, "Phoenix, my good old friend, may Minerva vouchsafe 
<A NAME="422"></A>me strength and keep the darts from off me, for so shall I stand by Patroclus 
<A NAME="423"></A>and defend him; his death has gone to my heart, but Hector is as a raging 
<A NAME="424"></A>fire and deals his blows without ceasing, for Jove is now granting him 
<A NAME="425"></A>a time of triumph."
<A NAME="426"></A><BR><BR>Minerva was pleased at his having named herself before any of the 
<A NAME="427"></A>other gods. Therefore she put strength into his knees and shoulders, and 
<A NAME="428"></A>made him as bold as a fly, which, though driven off will yet come again 
<A NAME="429"></A>and bite if it can, so dearly does it love man's blood- even so bold as 
<A NAME="430"></A>this did she make him as he stood over Patroclus and threw his spear. Now 
<A NAME="431"></A>there was among the Trojans a man named Podes, son of Eetion, who was both 
<A NAME="432"></A>rich and valiant. Hector held him in the highest honour for he was his 
<A NAME="433"></A>comrade and boon companion; the spear of Menelaus struck this man in the 
<A NAME="434"></A>girdle just as he had turned in flight, and went right through him. Whereon 
<A NAME="435"></A>he fell heavily forward, and Menelaus son of Atreus drew off his body from 
<A NAME="436"></A>the Trojans into the ranks of his own people.
<A NAME="437"></A><BR><BR>Apollo then went up to Hector and spurred him on to fight, in the 
<A NAME="438"></A>likeness of Phaenops son of Asius who lived in Abydos and was the most 
<A NAME="439"></A>favoured of all Hector's guests. In his likeness Apollo said, "Hector, 
<A NAME="440"></A>who of the Achaeans will fear you henceforward now that you have quailed 
<A NAME="441"></A>before Menelaus who has ever been rated poorly as a soldier? Yet he has 
<A NAME="442"></A>now got a corpse away from the Trojans single-handed, and has slain your 
<A NAME="443"></A>own true comrade, a man brave among the foremost, Podes son of 
<A NAME="444"></A>Eetion.
<A NAME="445"></A><BR><BR>A dark cloud of grief fell upon Hector as he heard, and he made 
<A NAME="446"></A>his way to the front clad in full armour. Thereon the son of Saturn seized 
<A NAME="447"></A>his bright tasselled aegis, and veiled Ida in cloud: he sent forth his 
<A NAME="448"></A>lightnings and his thunders, and as he shook his aegis he gave victory 
<A NAME="449"></A>to the Trojans and routed the Achaeans.
<A NAME="450"></A><BR><BR>The panic was begun by Peneleos the Boeotian, for while keeping 
<A NAME="451"></A>his face turned ever towards the foe he had been hit with a spear on the 
<A NAME="452"></A>upper part of the shoulder; a spear thrown by Polydamas had grazed the 
<A NAME="453"></A>top of the bone, for Polydamas had come up to him and struck him from close 
<A NAME="454"></A>at hand. Then Hector in close combat struck Leitus son of noble Alectryon 
<A NAME="455"></A>in the hand by the wrist, and disabled him from fighting further. He looked 
<A NAME="456"></A>about him in dismay, knowing that never again should he wield spear in 
<A NAME="457"></A>battle with the Trojans. While Hector was in pursuit of Leitus, Idomeneus 
<A NAME="458"></A>struck him on the breastplate over his chest near the nipple; but the spear 
<A NAME="459"></A>broke in the shaft, and the Trojans cheered aloud. Hector then aimed at 
<A NAME="460"></A>Idomeneus son of Deucalion as he was standing on his chariot, and very 
<A NAME="461"></A>narrowly missed him, but the spear hit Coiranus, a follower and charioteer 
<A NAME="462"></A>of Meriones who had come with him from Lyctus. Idomeneus had left the ships 
<A NAME="463"></A>on foot and would have afforded a great triumph to the Trojans if Coiranus 
<A NAME="464"></A>had not driven quickly up to him, he therefore brought life and rescue 
<A NAME="465"></A>to Idomeneus, but himself fell by the hand of murderous Hector. For Hector 
<A NAME="466"></A>hit him on the jaw under the ear; the end of the spear drove out his teeth 
<A NAME="467"></A>and cut his tongue in two pieces, so that he fell from his chariot and 
<A NAME="468"></A>let the reins fall to the ground. Meriones gathered them up from the ground 
<A NAME="469"></A>and took them into his own hands, then he said to Idomeneus, "Lay on, till 
<A NAME="470"></A>you get back to the ships, for you must see that the day is no longer 
<A NAME="471"></A>ours."
<A NAME="472"></A><BR><BR>On this Idomeneus lashed the horses to the ships, for fear had 
<A NAME="473"></A>taken hold upon him.
<A NAME="474"></A><BR><BR>Ajax and Menelaus noted how Jove had turned the scale in favour 
<A NAME="475"></A>of the Trojans, and Ajax was first to speak. "Alas," said he, "even a fool 
<A NAME="476"></A>may see that father Jove is helping the Trojans. All their weapons strike 
<A NAME="477"></A>home; no matter whether it be a brave man or a coward that hurls them, 
<A NAME="478"></A>Jove speeds all alike, whereas ours fall each one of them without effect. 
<A NAME="479"></A>What, then, will be best both as regards rescuing the body, and our return 
<A NAME="480"></A>to the joy of our friends who will be grieving as they look hitherwards; 
<A NAME="481"></A>for they will make sure that nothing can now check the terrible hands of 
<A NAME="482"></A>Hector, and that he will fling himself upon our ships. I wish that some 
<A NAME="483"></A>one would go and tell the son of Peleus at once, for I do not think he 
<A NAME="484"></A>can have yet heard the sad news that the dearest of his friends has fallen. 
<A NAME="485"></A>But I can see not a man among the Achaeans to send, for they and their 
<A NAME="486"></A>chariots are alike hidden in darkness. O father Jove, lift this cloud from 
<A NAME="487"></A>over the sons of the Achaeans; make heaven serene, and let us see; if you 
<A NAME="488"></A>will that we perish, let us fall at any rate by daylight."
<A NAME="489"></A><BR><BR>Father Jove heard him and had compassion upon his tears. Forthwith 
<A NAME="490"></A>he chased away the cloud of darkness, so that the sun shone out and all 
<A NAME="491"></A>the fighting was revealed. Ajax then said to Menelaus, "Look, Menelaus, 
<A NAME="492"></A>and if Antilochus son of Nestor be still living, send him at once to tell 
<A NAME="493"></A>Achilles that by far the dearest to him of all his comrades has 
<A NAME="494"></A>fallen."
<A NAME="495"></A><BR><BR>Menelaus heeded his words and went his way as a lion from a stockyard- 
<A NAME="496"></A>the lion is tired of attacking the men and hounds, who keep watch the whole 
<A NAME="497"></A>night through and will not let him feast on the fat of their herd. In his 
<A NAME="498"></A>lust of meat he makes straight at them but in vain, for darts from strong 
<A NAME="499"></A>hands assail him, and burning brands which daunt him for all his hunger, 
<A NAME="500"></A>so in the morning he slinks sulkily away- even so did Menelaus sorely against 
<A NAME="501"></A>his will leave Patroclus, in great fear lest the Achaeans should be driven 
<A NAME="502"></A>back in rout and let him fall into the hands of the foe. He charged Meriones 
<A NAME="503"></A>and the two Ajaxes straitly saying, "Ajaxes and Meriones, leaders of the 
<A NAME="504"></A>Argives, now indeed remember how good Patroclus was; he was ever courteous 
<A NAME="505"></A>while alive, bear it in mind now that he is dead."
<A NAME="506"></A><BR><BR>With this Menelaus left them, looking round him as keenly as an 
<A NAME="507"></A>eagle, whose sight they say is keener than that of any other bird- however 
<A NAME="508"></A>high he may be in the heavens, not a hare that runs can escape him by crouching 
<A NAME="509"></A>under bush or thicket, for he will swoop down upon it and make an end of 
<A NAME="510"></A>it- even so, O Menelaus, did your keen eyes range round the mighty host 
<A NAME="511"></A>of your followers to see if you could find the son of Nestor still alive. 
<A NAME="512"></A>Presently Menelaus saw him on the extreme left of the battle cheering on 
<A NAME="513"></A>his men and exhorting them to fight boldly. Menelaus went up to him and 
<A NAME="514"></A>said, "Antilochus, come here and listen to sad news, which I would indeed 
<A NAME="515"></A>were untrue. You must see with your own eyes that heaven is heaping calamity 
<A NAME="516"></A>upon the Danaans, and giving victory to the Trojans. Patroclus has fallen, 
<A NAME="517"></A>who was the bravest of the Achaeans, and sorely will the Danaans miss him. 
<A NAME="518"></A>Run instantly to the ships and tell Achilles, that he may come to rescue 
<A NAME="519"></A>the body and bear it to the ships. As for the armour, Hector already has 
<A NAME="520"></A>it."
<A NAME="521"></A><BR><BR>Antilochus was struck with horror. For a long time he was speechless; 
<A NAME="522"></A>his eyes filled with tears and he could find no utterance, but he did as 
<A NAME="523"></A>Menelaus had said, and set off running as soon as he had given his armour 
<A NAME="524"></A>to a comrade, Laodocus, who was wheeling his horses round, close beside 
<A NAME="525"></A>him.
<A NAME="526"></A><BR><BR>Thus, then, did he run weeping from the field, to carry the bad 
<A NAME="527"></A>news to Achilles son of Peleus. Nor were you, O Menelaus, minded to succour 
<A NAME="528"></A>his harassed comrades, when Antilochus had left the Pylians- and greatly 
<A NAME="529"></A>did they miss him- but he sent them noble Thrasymedes, and himself went 
<A NAME="530"></A>back to Patroclus. He came running up to the two Ajaxes and said, "I have 
<A NAME="531"></A>sent Antilochus to the ships to tell Achilles, but rage against Hector 
<A NAME="532"></A>as he may, he cannot come, for he cannot fight without armour. What then 
<A NAME="533"></A>will be our best plan both as regards rescuing the dead, and our own escape 
<A NAME="534"></A>from death amid the battle-cries of the Trojans?"
<A NAME="535"></A><BR><BR>Ajax answered, "Menelaus, you have said well: do you, then, and 
<A NAME="536"></A>Meriones stoop down, raise the body, and bear it out of the fray, while 
<A NAME="537"></A>we two behind you keep off Hector and the Trojans, one in heart as in name, 
<A NAME="538"></A>and long used to fighting side by side with one another."
<A NAME="539"></A><BR><BR>On this Menelaus and Meriones took the dead man in their arms and 
<A NAME="540"></A>lifted him high aloft with a great effort. The Trojan host raised a hue 
<A NAME="541"></A>and cry behind them when they saw the Achaeans bearing the body away, and 
<A NAME="542"></A>flew after them like hounds attacking a wounded boar at the loo of a band 
<A NAME="543"></A>of young huntsmen. For a while the hounds fly at him as though they would 
<A NAME="544"></A>tear him in pieces, but now and again he turns on them in a fury, scaring 
<A NAME="545"></A>and scattering them in all directions- even so did the Trojans for a while 
<A NAME="546"></A>charge in a body, striking with sword and with spears pointed ai both the 
<A NAME="547"></A>ends, but when the two Ajaxes faced them and stood at bay, they would turn 
<A NAME="548"></A>pale and no man dared press on to fight further about the 
<A NAME="549"></A>dead.
<A NAME="550"></A><BR><BR>In this wise did the two heroes strain every nerve to bear the 
<A NAME="551"></A>body to the ships out of the fight. The battle raged round them like fierce 
<A NAME="552"></A>flames that when once kindled spread like wildfire over a city, and the 
<A NAME="553"></A>houses fall in the glare of its burning- even such was the roar and tramp 
<A NAME="554"></A>of men and horses that pursued them as they bore Patroclus from the field. 
<A NAME="555"></A>Or as mules that put forth all their strength to draw some beam or great 
<A NAME="556"></A>piece of ship's timber down a rough mountain-track, and they pant and sweat 
<A NAME="557"></A>as they, go even so did Menelaus and pant and sweat as they bore the body 
<A NAME="558"></A>of Patroclus. Behind them the two Ajaxes held stoutly out. As some wooded 
<A NAME="559"></A>mountain-spur that stretches across a plain will turn water and check the 
<A NAME="560"></A>flow even of a great river, nor is there any stream strong enough to break 
<A NAME="561"></A>through it- even so did the two Ajaxes face the Trojans and stern the tide 
<A NAME="562"></A>of their fighting though they kept pouring on towards them and foremost 
<A NAME="563"></A>among them all was Aeneas son of Anchises with valiant Hector. As a flock 
<A NAME="564"></A>of daws or starlings fall to screaming and chattering when they see a falcon, 
<A NAME="565"></A>foe to i'll small birds, come soaring near them, even so did the Achaean 
<A NAME="566"></A>youth raise a babel of cries as they fled before Aeneas and Hector, unmindful 
<A NAME="567"></A>of their former prowess. In the rout of the Danaans much goodly armour 
<A NAME="568"></A>fell round about the trench, and of fighting there was no 
<A NAME="569"></A>end.

<A NAME="end"></A>
