<A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A>Now when Dawn in robe of saffron was hasting from the streams of Oceanus, 
<A NAME="11"></A>to bring light to mortals and immortals, Thetis reached the ships with 
<A NAME="12"></A>the armour that the god had given her. She found her son fallen about the 
<A NAME="13"></A>body of Patroclus and weeping bitterly. Many also of his followers were 
<A NAME="14"></A>weeping round him, but when the goddess came among them she clasped his 
<A NAME="15"></A>hand in her own, saying, "My son, grieve as we may we must let this man 
<A NAME="16"></A>lie, for it is by heaven's will that he has fallen; now, therefore, accept 
<A NAME="17"></A>from Vulcan this rich and goodly armour, which no man has ever yet borne 
<A NAME="18"></A>upon his shoulders."
<A NAME="19"></A><BR><BR>As she spoke she set the armour before Achilles, and it rang out 
<A NAME="20"></A>bravely as she did so. The Myrmidons were struck with awe, and none dared 
<A NAME="21"></A>look full at it, for they were afraid; but Achilles was roused to still 
<A NAME="22"></A>greater fury, and his eyes gleamed with a fierce light, for he was glad 
<A NAME="23"></A>when he handled the splendid present which the god had made him. Then, 
<A NAME="24"></A>as soon as he had satisfied himself with looking at it, he said to his 
<A NAME="25"></A>mother, "Mother, the god has given me armour, meet handiwork for an immortal 
<A NAME="26"></A>and such as no living could have fashioned; I will now arm, but I much 
<A NAME="27"></A>fear that flies will settle upon the son of Menoetius and breed worms about 
<A NAME="28"></A>his wounds, so that his body, now he is dead, will be disfigured and the 
<A NAME="29"></A>flesh will rot."
<A NAME="30"></A><BR><BR>Silver-footed Thetis answered, "My son, be not disquieted about 
<A NAME="31"></A>this matter. I will find means to protect him from the swarms of noisome 
<A NAME="32"></A>flies that prey on the bodies of men who have been killed in battle. He 
<A NAME="33"></A>may lie for a whole year, and his flesh shall still be as sound as ever, 
<A NAME="34"></A>or even sounder. Call, therefore, the Achaean heroes in assembly; unsay 
<A NAME="35"></A>your anger against Agamemnon; arm at once, and fight with might and 
<A NAME="36"></A>main."
<A NAME="37"></A><BR><BR>As she spoke she put strength and courage into his heart, and she 
<A NAME="38"></A>then dropped ambrosia and red nectar into the wounds of Patroclus, that 
<A NAME="39"></A>his body might suffer no change.
<A NAME="40"></A><BR><BR>Then Achilles went out upon the seashore, and with a loud cry called 
<A NAME="41"></A>on the Achaean heroes. On this even those who as yet had stayed always 
<A NAME="42"></A>at the ships, the pilots and helmsmen, and even the stewards who were about 
<A NAME="43"></A>the ships and served out rations, all came to the place of assembly because 
<A NAME="44"></A>Achilles had shown himself after having held aloof so long from fighting. 
<A NAME="45"></A>Two sons of Mars, Ulysses and the son of Tydeus, came limping, for their 
<A NAME="46"></A>wounds still pained them; nevertheless they came, and took their seats 
<A NAME="47"></A>in the front row of the assembly. Last of all came Agamemnon, king of men, 
<A NAME="48"></A>he too wounded, for Coon son of Antenor had struck him with a spear in 
<A NAME="49"></A>battle.
<A NAME="50"></A><BR><BR>When the Achaeans were got together Achilles rose and said, "Son 
<A NAME="51"></A>of Atreus, surely it would have been better alike for both you and me, 
<A NAME="52"></A>when we two were in such high anger about Briseis, surely it would have 
<A NAME="53"></A>been better, had Diana's arrow slain her at the ships on the day when I 
<A NAME="54"></A>took her after having sacked Lyrnessus. For so, many an Achaean the less 
<A NAME="55"></A>would have bitten dust before the foe in the days of my anger. It has been 
<A NAME="56"></A>well for Hector and the Trojans, but the Achaeans will long indeed remember 
<A NAME="57"></A>our quarrel. Now, however, let it be, for it is over. If we have been angry, 
<A NAME="58"></A>necessity has schooled our anger. I put it from me: I dare not nurse it 
<A NAME="59"></A>for ever; therefore, bid the Achaeans arm forthwith that I may go out against 
<A NAME="60"></A>the Trojans, and learn whether they will be in a mind to sleep by the ships 
<A NAME="61"></A>or no. Glad, I ween, will he be to rest his knees who may fly my spear 
<A NAME="62"></A>when I wield it."
<A NAME="63"></A><BR><BR>Thus did he speak, and the Achaeans rejoiced in that he had put 
<A NAME="64"></A>away his anger.
<A NAME="65"></A><BR><BR>Then Agamemnon spoke, rising in his place, and not going into the 
<A NAME="66"></A>middle of the assembly. "Danaan heroes," said he, "servants of Mars, it 
<A NAME="67"></A>is well to listen when a man stands up to speak, and it is not seemly to 
<A NAME="68"></A>interrupt him, or it will go hard even with a practised speaker. Who can 
<A NAME="69"></A>either hear or speak in an uproar? Even the finest orator will be disconcerted 
<A NAME="70"></A>by it. I will expound to the son of Peleus, and do you other Achaeans heed 
<A NAME="71"></A>me and mark me well. Often have the Achaeans spoken to me of this matter 
<A NAME="72"></A>and upbraided me, but it was not I that did it: Jove, and Fate, and Erinys 
<A NAME="73"></A>that walks in darkness struck me mad when we were assembled on the day 
<A NAME="74"></A>that I took from Achilles the meed that had been awarded to him. What could 
<A NAME="75"></A>I do? All things are in the hand of heaven, and Folly, eldest of Jove's 
<A NAME="76"></A>daughters, shuts men's eyes to their destruction. She walks delicately, 
<A NAME="77"></A>not on the solid earth, but hovers over the heads of men to make them stumble 
<A NAME="78"></A>or to ensnare them.
<A NAME="79"></A><BR><BR>"Time was when she fooled Jove himself, who they say is greatest 
<A NAME="80"></A>whether of gods or men; for Juno, woman though she was, beguiled him on 
<A NAME="81"></A>the day when Alcmena was to bring forth mighty Hercules in the fair city 
<A NAME="82"></A>of Thebes. He told it out among the gods saying, 'Hear me all gods and 
<A NAME="83"></A>goddesses, that I may speak even as I am minded; this day shall an Ilithuia, 
<A NAME="84"></A>helper of women who are in labour, bring a man child into the world who 
<A NAME="85"></A>shall be lord over all that dwell about him who are of my blood and lineage.' 
<A NAME="86"></A>Then said Juno all crafty and full of guile, 'You will play false, and 
<A NAME="87"></A>will not hold to your word. Swear me, O Olympian, swear me a great oath, 
<A NAME="88"></A>that he who shall this day fall between the feet of a woman, shall be lord 
<A NAME="89"></A>over all that dwell about him who are of your blood and 
<A NAME="90"></A>lineage.'
<A NAME="91"></A><BR><BR>"Thus she spoke, and Jove suspected her not, but swore the great 
<A NAME="92"></A>oath, to his much ruing thereafter. For Juno darted down from the high 
<A NAME="93"></A>summit of Olympus, and went in haste to Achaean Argos where she knew that 
<A NAME="94"></A>the noble wife of Sthenelus son of Perseus then was. She being with child 
<A NAME="95"></A>and in her seventh month, Juno brought the child to birth though there 
<A NAME="96"></A>was a month still wanting, but she stayed the offspring of Alcmena, and 
<A NAME="97"></A>kept back the Ilithuiae. Then she went to tell Jove the son of Saturn, 
<A NAME="98"></A>and said, 'Father Jove, lord of the lightning- I have a word for your ear. 
<A NAME="99"></A>There is a fine child born this day, Eurystheus, son to Sthenelus the son 
<A NAME="100"></A>of Perseus; he is of your lineage; it is well, therefore, that he should 
<A NAME="101"></A>reign over the Argives.'
<A NAME="102"></A><BR><BR>"On this Jove was stung to the very quick, and in his rage he caught 
<A NAME="103"></A>Folly by the hair, and swore a great oath that never should she again invade 
<A NAME="104"></A>starry heaven and Olympus, for she was the bane of all. Then he whirled 
<A NAME="105"></A>her round with a twist of his hand, and flung her down from heaven so that 
<A NAME="106"></A>she fell on to the fields of mortal men; and he was ever angry with her 
<A NAME="107"></A>when he saw his son groaning under the cruel labours that Eurystheus laid 
<A NAME="108"></A>upon him. Even so did I grieve when mighty Hector was killing the Argives 
<A NAME="109"></A>at their ships, and all the time I kept thinking of Folly who had so baned 
<A NAME="110"></A>me. I was blind, and Jove robbed me of my reason; I will now make atonement, 
<A NAME="111"></A>and will add much treasure by way of amends. Go, therefore, into battle, 
<A NAME="112"></A>you and your people with you. I will give you all that Ulysses offered 
<A NAME="113"></A>you yesterday in your tents: or if it so please you, wait, though you would 
<A NAME="114"></A>fain fight at once, and my squires shall bring the gifts from my ship, 
<A NAME="115"></A>that you may see whether what I give you is enough."
<A NAME="116"></A><BR><BR>And Achilles answered, "Son of Atreus, king of men Agamemnon, you 
<A NAME="117"></A>can give such gifts as you think proper, or you can withhold them: it is 
<A NAME="118"></A>in your own hands. Let us now set battle in array; it is not well to tarry 
<A NAME="119"></A>talking about trifles, for there is a deed which is as yet to do. Achilles 
<A NAME="120"></A>shall again be seen fighting among the foremost, and laying low the ranks 
<A NAME="121"></A>of the Trojans: bear this in mind each one of you when he is 
<A NAME="122"></A>fighting."
<A NAME="123"></A><BR><BR>Then Ulysses said, "Achilles, godlike and brave, send not the Achaeans 
<A NAME="124"></A>thus against Ilius to fight the Trojans fasting, for the battle will be 
<A NAME="125"></A>no brief one, when it is once begun, and heaven has filled both sides with 
<A NAME="126"></A>fury; bid them first take food both bread and wine by the ships, for in 
<A NAME="127"></A>this there is strength and stay. No man can do battle the livelong day 
<A NAME="128"></A>to the going down of the sun if he is without food; however much he may 
<A NAME="129"></A>want to fight his strength will fail him before he knows it; hunger and 
<A NAME="130"></A>thirst will find him out, and his limbs will grow weary under him. But 
<A NAME="131"></A>a man can fight all day if he is full fed with meat and wine; his heart 
<A NAME="132"></A>beats high, and his strength will stay till he has routed all his foes; 
<A NAME="133"></A>therefore, send the people away and bid them prepare their meal; King Agamemnon 
<A NAME="134"></A>will bring out the gifts in presence of the assembly, that all may see 
<A NAME="135"></A>them and you may be satisfied. Moreover let him swear an oath before the 
<A NAME="136"></A>Argives that he has never gone up into the couch of Briseis, nor been with 
<A NAME="137"></A>her after the manner of men and women; and do you, too, show yourself of 
<A NAME="138"></A>a gracious mind; let Agamemnon entertain you in his tents with a feast 
<A NAME="139"></A>of reconciliation, that so you may have had your dues in full. As for you, 
<A NAME="140"></A>son of Atreus, treat people more righteously in future; it is no disgrace 
<A NAME="141"></A>even to a king that he should make amends if he was wrong in the first 
<A NAME="142"></A>instance."
<A NAME="143"></A><BR><BR>And King Agamemnon answered, "Son of Laertes, your words please 
<A NAME="144"></A>me well, for throughout you have spoken wisely. I will swear as you would 
<A NAME="145"></A>have me do; I do so of my own free will, neither shall I take the name 
<A NAME="146"></A>of heaven in vain. Let, then, Achilles wait, though he would fain fight 
<A NAME="147"></A>at once, and do you others wait also, till the gifts come from my tent 
<A NAME="148"></A>and we ratify the oath with sacrifice. Thus, then, do I charge you: take 
<A NAME="149"></A>some noble young Achaeans with you, and bring from my tents the gifts that 
<A NAME="150"></A>I promised yesterday to Achilles, and bring the women also; furthermore 
<A NAME="151"></A>let Talthybius find me a boar from those that are with the host, and make 
<A NAME="152"></A>it ready for sacrifice to Jove and to the sun."
<A NAME="153"></A><BR><BR>Then said Achilles, "Son of Atreus, king of men Agamemnon, see 
<A NAME="154"></A>to these matters at some other season, when there is breathing time and 
<A NAME="155"></A>when I am calmer. Would you have men eat while the bodies of those whom 
<A NAME="156"></A>Hector son of Priam slew are still lying mangled upon the plain? Let the 
<A NAME="157"></A>sons of the Achaeans, say I, fight fasting and without food, till we have 
<A NAME="158"></A>avenged them; afterwards at the going down of the sun let them eat their 
<A NAME="159"></A>fill. As for me, Patroclus is lying dead in my tent, all hacked and hewn, 
<A NAME="160"></A>with his feet to the door, and his comrades are mourning round him. Therefore 
<A NAME="161"></A>I can take thought of nothing save only slaughter and blood and the rattle 
<A NAME="162"></A>in the throat of the dying."
<A NAME="163"></A><BR><BR>Ulysses answered, "Achilles, son of Peleus, mightiest of all the 
<A NAME="164"></A>Achaeans, in battle you are better than I, and that more than a little, 
<A NAME="165"></A>but in counsel I am much before you, for I am older and of greater knowledge. 
<A NAME="166"></A>Therefore be patient under my words. Fighting is a thing of which men soon 
<A NAME="167"></A>surfeit, and when Jove, who is wars steward, weighs the upshot, it may 
<A NAME="168"></A>well prove that the straw which our sickles have reaped is far heavier 
<A NAME="169"></A>than the grain. It may not be that the Achaeans should mourn the dead with 
<A NAME="170"></A>their bellies; day by day men fall thick and threefold continually; when 
<A NAME="171"></A>should we have respite from our sorrow? Let us mourn our dead for a day 
<A NAME="172"></A>and bury them out of sight and mind, but let those of us who are left eat 
<A NAME="173"></A>and drink that we may arm and fight our foes more fiercely. In that hour 
<A NAME="174"></A>let no man hold back, waiting for a second summons; such summons shall 
<A NAME="175"></A>bode ill for him who is found lagging behind at our ships; let us rather 
<A NAME="176"></A>sally as one man and loose the fury of war upon the 
<A NAME="177"></A>Trojans."
<A NAME="178"></A><BR><BR>When he had thus spoken he took with him the sons of Nestor, with 
<A NAME="179"></A>Meges son of Phyleus, Thoas, Meriones, Lycomedes son of Creontes, and Melanippus, 
<A NAME="180"></A>and went to the tent of Agamemnon son of Atreus. The word was not sooner 
<A NAME="181"></A>said than the deed was done: they brought out the seven tripods which Agamemnon 
<A NAME="182"></A>had promised, with the twenty metal cauldrons and the twelve horses; they 
<A NAME="183"></A>also brought the women skilled in useful arts, seven in number, with Briseis, 
<A NAME="184"></A>which made eight. Ulysses weighed out the ten talents of gold and then 
<A NAME="185"></A>led the way back, while the young Achaeans brought the rest of the gifts, 
<A NAME="186"></A>and laid them in the middle of the assembly.
<A NAME="187"></A><BR><BR>Agamemnon then rose, and Talthybius whose voice was like that of 
<A NAME="188"></A>a god came to him with the boar. The son of Atreus drew the knife which 
<A NAME="189"></A>he wore by the scabbard of his mighty sword, and began by cutting off some 
<A NAME="190"></A>bristles from the boar, lifting up his hands in prayer as he did so. The 
<A NAME="191"></A>other Achaeans sat where they were all silent and orderly to hear the king, 
<A NAME="192"></A>and Agamemnon looked into the vault of heaven and prayed saying, "I call 
<A NAME="193"></A>Jove the first and mightiest of all gods to witness, I call also Earth 
<A NAME="194"></A>and Sun and the Erinyes who dwell below and take vengeance on him who shall 
<A NAME="195"></A>swear falsely, that I have laid no hand upon the girl Briseis, neither 
<A NAME="196"></A>to take her to my bed nor otherwise, but that she has remained in my tents 
<A NAME="197"></A>inviolate. If I swear falsely may heaven visit me with all the penalties 
<A NAME="198"></A>which it metes out to those who perjure themselves."
<A NAME="199"></A><BR><BR>He cut the boar's throat as he spoke, whereon Talthybius whirled 
<A NAME="200"></A>it round his head, and flung it into the wide sea to feed the fishes. Then 
<A NAME="201"></A>Achilles also rose and said to the Argives, "Father Jove, of a truth you 
<A NAME="202"></A>blind men's eyes and bane them. The son of Atreus had not else stirred 
<A NAME="203"></A>me to so fierce an anger, nor so stubbornly taken Briseis from me against 
<A NAME="204"></A>my will. Surely Jove must have counselled the destruction of many an Argive. 
<A NAME="205"></A>Go, now, and take your food that we may begin fighting."
<A NAME="206"></A><BR><BR>On this he broke up the assembly, and every man went back to his 
<A NAME="207"></A>own ship. The Myrmidons attended to the presents and took them away to 
<A NAME="208"></A>the ship of Achilles. They placed them in his tents, while the stable-men 
<A NAME="209"></A>drove the horses in among the others.
<A NAME="210"></A><BR><BR>Briseis, fair as Venus, when she saw the mangled body of Patroclus, 
<A NAME="211"></A>flung herself upon it and cried aloud, tearing her breast, her neck, and 
<A NAME="212"></A>her lovely face with both her hands. Beautiful as a goddess she wept and 
<A NAME="213"></A>said, "Patroclus, dearest friend, when I went hence I left you living; 
<A NAME="214"></A>I return, O prince, to find you dead; thus do fresh sorrows multiply upon 
<A NAME="215"></A>me one after the other. I saw him to whom my father and mother married 
<A NAME="216"></A>me, cut down before our city, and my three own dear brothers perished with 
<A NAME="217"></A>him on the self-same day; but you, Patroclus, even when Achilles slew my 
<A NAME="218"></A>husband and sacked the city of noble Mynes, told me that I was not to weep, 
<A NAME="219"></A>for you said you would make Achilles marry me, and take me back with him 
<A NAME="220"></A>to Phthia, we should have a wedding feast among the Myrmidons. You were 
<A NAME="221"></A>always kind to me and I shall never cease to grieve for 
<A NAME="222"></A>you."
<A NAME="223"></A><BR><BR>She wept as she spoke, and the women joined in her lament-making 
<A NAME="224"></A>as though their tears were for Patroclus, but in truth each was weeping 
<A NAME="225"></A>for her own sorrows. The elders of the Achaeans gathered round Achilles 
<A NAME="226"></A>and prayed him to take food, but he groaned and would not do so. "I pray 
<A NAME="227"></A>you," said he, "if any comrade will hear me, bid me neither eat nor drink, 
<A NAME="228"></A>for I am in great heaviness, and will stay fasting even to the going down 
<A NAME="229"></A>of the sun."
<A NAME="230"></A><BR><BR>On this he sent the other princes away, save only the two sons 
<A NAME="231"></A>of Atreus and Ulysses, Nestor, Idomeneus, and the knight Phoenix, who stayed 
<A NAME="232"></A>behind and tried to comfort him in the bitterness of his sorrow: but he 
<A NAME="233"></A>would not be comforted till he should have flung himself into the jaws 
<A NAME="234"></A>of battle, and he fetched sigh on sigh, thinking ever of Patroclus. Then 
<A NAME="235"></A>he said-
<A NAME="236"></A><BR><BR>"Hapless and dearest comrade, you it was who would get a good dinner 
<A NAME="237"></A>ready for me at once and without delay when the Achaeans were hasting to 
<A NAME="238"></A>fight the Trojans; now, therefore, though I have meat and drink in my tents, 
<A NAME="239"></A>yet will I fast for sorrow. Grief greater than this I could not know, not 
<A NAME="240"></A>even though I were to hear of the death of my father, who is now in Phthia 
<A NAME="241"></A>weeping for the loss of me his son, who am here fighting the Trojans in 
<A NAME="242"></A>a strange land for the accursed sake of Helen, nor yet though I should 
<A NAME="243"></A>hear that my son is no more- he who is being brought up in Scyros- if indeed 
<A NAME="244"></A>Neoptolemus is still living. Till now I made sure that I alone was to fall 
<A NAME="245"></A>here at Troy away from Argos, while you were to return to Phthia, bring 
<A NAME="246"></A>back my son with you in your own ship, and show him all my property, my 
<A NAME="247"></A>bondsmen, and the greatness of my house- for Peleus must surely be either 
<A NAME="248"></A>dead, or what little life remains to him is oppressed alike with the infirmities 
<A NAME="249"></A>of age and ever present fear lest he should hear the sad tidings of my 
<A NAME="250"></A>death."
<A NAME="251"></A><BR><BR>He wept as he spoke, and the elders sighed in concert as each thought 
<A NAME="252"></A>on what he had left at home behind him. The son of Saturn looked down with 
<A NAME="253"></A>pity upon them, and said presently to Minerva, "My child, you have quite 
<A NAME="254"></A>deserted your hero; is he then gone so clean out of your recollection? 
<A NAME="255"></A>There he sits by the ships all desolate for the loss of his dear comrade, 
<A NAME="256"></A>and though the others are gone to their dinner he will neither eat nor 
<A NAME="257"></A>drink. Go then and drop nectar and ambrosia into his breast, that he may 
<A NAME="258"></A>know no hunger."
<A NAME="259"></A><BR><BR>With these words he urged Minerva, who was already of the same 
<A NAME="260"></A>mind. She darted down from heaven into the air like some falcon sailing 
<A NAME="261"></A>on his broad wings and screaming. Meanwhile the Achaeans were arming throughout 
<A NAME="262"></A>the host, and when Minerva had dropped nectar and ambrosia into Achilles 
<A NAME="263"></A>so that no cruel hunger should cause his limbs to fail him, she went back 
<A NAME="264"></A>to the house of her mighty father. Thick as the chill snow-flakes shed 
<A NAME="265"></A>from the hand of Jove and borne on the keen blasts of the north wind, even 
<A NAME="266"></A>so thick did the gleaming helmets, the bossed shields, the strongly plated 
<A NAME="267"></A>breastplates, and the ashen spears stream from the ships. The sheen pierced 
<A NAME="268"></A>the sky, the whole land was radiant with their flashing armour, and the 
<A NAME="269"></A>sound of the tramp of their treading rose from under their feet. In the 
<A NAME="270"></A>midst of them all Achilles put on his armour; he gnashed his teeth, his 
<A NAME="271"></A>eyes gleamed like fire, for his grief was greater than he could bear. Thus, 
<A NAME="272"></A>then, full of fury against the Trojans, did he don the gift of the god, 
<A NAME="273"></A>the armour that Vulcan had made him.
<A NAME="274"></A><BR><BR>First he put on the goodly greaves fitted with ancle-clasps, and 
<A NAME="275"></A>next he did on the breastplate about his chest. He slung the silver-studded 
<A NAME="276"></A>sword of bronze about his shoulders, and then took up the shield so great 
<A NAME="277"></A>and strong that shone afar with a splendour as of the moon. As the light 
<A NAME="278"></A>seen by sailors from out at sea, when men have lit a fire in their homestead 
<A NAME="279"></A>high up among the mountains, but the sailors are carried out to sea by 
<A NAME="280"></A>wind and storm far from the haven where they would be- even so did the 
<A NAME="281"></A>gleam of Achilles' wondrous shield strike up into the heavens. He lifted 
<A NAME="282"></A>the redoubtable helmet, and set it upon his head, from whence it shone 
<A NAME="283"></A>like a star, and the golden plumes which Vulcan had set thick about the 
<A NAME="284"></A>ridge of the helmet, waved all around it. Then Achilles made trial of himself 
<A NAME="285"></A>in his armour to see whether it fitted him, so that his limbs could play 
<A NAME="286"></A>freely under it, and it seemed to buoy him up as though it had been 
<A NAME="287"></A>wings.
<A NAME="288"></A><BR><BR>He also drew his father's spear out of the spear-stand, a spear 
<A NAME="289"></A>so great and heavy and strong that none of the Achaeans save only Achilles 
<A NAME="290"></A>had strength to wield it; this was the spear of Pelian ash from the topmost 
<A NAME="291"></A>ridges of Mt. Pelion, which Chiron had once given to Peleus, fraught with 
<A NAME="292"></A>the death of heroes. Automedon and Alcimus busied themselves with the harnessing 
<A NAME="293"></A>of his horses; they made the bands fast about them, and put the bit in 
<A NAME="294"></A>their mouths, drawing the reins back towards the chariot. Automedon, whip 
<A NAME="295"></A>in hand, sprang up behind the horses, and after him Achilles mounted in 
<A NAME="296"></A>full armour, resplendent as the sun-god Hyperion. Then with a loud voice 
<A NAME="297"></A>he chided with his father's horses saying, "Xanthus and Balius, famed offspring 
<A NAME="298"></A>of Podarge- this time when we have done fighting be sure and bring your 
<A NAME="299"></A>driver safely back to the host of the Achaeans, and do not leave him dead 
<A NAME="300"></A>on the plain as you did Patroclus."
<A NAME="301"></A><BR><BR>Then fleet Xanthus answered under the yoke- for white-armed Juno 
<A NAME="302"></A>had endowed him with human speech- and he bowed his head till his mane 
<A NAME="303"></A>touched the ground as it hung down from under the yoke-band. "Dread Achilles," 
<A NAME="304"></A>said he, "we will indeed save you now, but the day of your death is near, 
<A NAME="305"></A>and the blame will not be ours, for it will be heaven and stern fate that 
<A NAME="306"></A>will destroy you. Neither was it through any sloth or slackness on our 
<A NAME="307"></A>part that the Trojans stripped Patroclus of his armour; it was the mighty 
<A NAME="308"></A>god whom lovely Leto bore that slew him as he fought among the foremost, 
<A NAME="309"></A>and vouchsafed a triumph to Hector. We two can fly as swiftly as Zephyrus 
<A NAME="310"></A>who they say is fleetest of all winds; nevertheless it is your doom to 
<A NAME="311"></A>fall by the hand of a man and of a god."
<A NAME="312"></A><BR><BR>When he had thus said the Erinyes stayed his speech, and Achilles 
<A NAME="313"></A>answered him in great sadness, saying, "Why, O Xanthus, do you thus foretell 
<A NAME="314"></A>my death? You need not do so, for I well know that I am to fall here, far 
<A NAME="315"></A>from my dear father and mother; none the more, however, shall I stay my 
<A NAME="316"></A>hand till I have given the Trojans their fill of fighting."
<A NAME="317"></A><BR><BR>So saying, with a loud cry he drove his horses to the 
<A NAME="318"></A>front.
