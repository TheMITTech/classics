<A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A>And now as Dawn rose from her couch beside Tithonus, harbinger of light 
<A NAME="11"></A>alike to mortals and immortals, Jove sent fierce Discord with the ensign 
<A NAME="12"></A>of war in her hands to the ships of the Achaeans. She took her stand by 
<A NAME="13"></A>the huge black hull of Ulysses' ship which was middlemost of all, so that 
<A NAME="14"></A>her voice might carry farthest on either side, on the one hand towards 
<A NAME="15"></A>the tents of Ajax son of Telamon, and on the other towards those of Achilles- 
<A NAME="16"></A>for these two heroes, well-assured of their own strength, had valorously 
<A NAME="17"></A>drawn up their ships at the two ends of the line. There she took her stand, 
<A NAME="18"></A>and raised a cry both loud and shrill that filled the Achaeans with courage, 
<A NAME="19"></A>giving them heart to fight resolutely and with all their might, so that 
<A NAME="20"></A>they had rather stay there and do battle than go home in their 
<A NAME="21"></A>ships.
<A NAME="22"></A><BR><BR>The son of Atreus shouted aloud and bade the Argives gird themselves 
<A NAME="23"></A>for battle while he put on his armour. First he girded his goodly greaves 
<A NAME="24"></A>about his legs, making them fast with ankle clasps of silver; and about 
<A NAME="25"></A>his chest he set the breastplate which Cinyras had once given him as a 
<A NAME="26"></A>guest-gift. It had been noised abroad as far as Cyprus that the Achaeans 
<A NAME="27"></A>were about to sail for Troy, and therefore he gave it to the king. It had 
<A NAME="28"></A>ten courses of dark cyanus, twelve of gold, and ten of tin. There were 
<A NAME="29"></A>serpents of cyanus that reared themselves up towards the neck, three upon 
<A NAME="30"></A>either side, like the rainbows which the son of Saturn has set in heaven 
<A NAME="31"></A>as a sign to mortal men. About his shoulders he threw his sword, studded 
<A NAME="32"></A>with bosses of gold; and the scabbard was of silver with a chain of gold 
<A NAME="33"></A>wherewith to hang it. He took moreover the richly-dight shield that covered 
<A NAME="34"></A>his body when he was in battle- fair to see, with ten circles of bronze 
<A NAME="35"></A>running all round see, wit it. On the body of the shield there were twenty 
<A NAME="36"></A>bosses of white tin, with another of dark cyanus in the middle: this last 
<A NAME="37"></A>was made to show a Gorgon's head, fierce and grim, with Rout and Panic 
<A NAME="38"></A>on either side. The band for the arm to go through was of silver, on which 
<A NAME="39"></A>there was a writhing snake of cyanus with three heads that sprang from 
<A NAME="40"></A>a single neck, and went in and out among one another. On his head Agamemnon 
<A NAME="41"></A>set a helmet, with a peak before and behind, and four plumes of horse-hair 
<A NAME="42"></A>that nodded menacingly above it; then he grasped two redoubtable bronze-shod 
<A NAME="43"></A>spears, and the gleam of his armour shot from him as a flame into the firmament, 
<A NAME="44"></A>while Juno and Minerva thundered in honour of the king of rich 
<A NAME="45"></A>Mycene.
<A NAME="46"></A><BR><BR>Every man now left his horses in charge of his charioteer to hold 
<A NAME="47"></A>them in readiness by the trench, while he went into battle on foot clad 
<A NAME="48"></A>in full armour, and a mighty uproar rose on high into the dawning. The 
<A NAME="49"></A>chiefs were armed and at the trench before the horses got there, but these 
<A NAME="50"></A>came up presently. The son of Saturn sent a portent of evil sound about 
<A NAME="51"></A>their host, and the dew fell red with blood, for he was about to send many 
<A NAME="52"></A>a brave man hurrying down to Hades.
<A NAME="53"></A><BR><BR>The Trojans, on the other side upon the rising slope of the plain, 
<A NAME="54"></A>were gathered round great Hector, noble Polydamas, Aeneas who was honoured 
<A NAME="55"></A>by the Trojans like an immortal, and the three sons of Antenor, Polybus, 
<A NAME="56"></A>Agenor, and young Acamas beauteous as a god. Hector's round shield showed 
<A NAME="57"></A>in the front rank, and as some baneful star that shines for a moment through 
<A NAME="58"></A>a rent in the clouds and is again hidden beneath them; even so was Hector 
<A NAME="59"></A>now seen in the front ranks and now again in the hindermost, and his bronze 
<A NAME="60"></A>armour gleamed like the lightning of aegis-bearing Jove.
<A NAME="61"></A><BR><BR>And now as a band of reapers mow swathes of wheat or barley upon 
<A NAME="62"></A>a rich man's land, and the sheaves fall thick before them, even so did 
<A NAME="63"></A>the Trojans and Achaeans fall upon one another; they were in no mood for 
<A NAME="64"></A>yielding but fought like wolves, and neither side got the better of the 
<A NAME="65"></A>other. Discord was glad as she beheld them, for she was the only god that 
<A NAME="66"></A>went among them; the others were not there, but stayed quietly each in 
<A NAME="67"></A>his own home among the dells and valleys of Olympus. All of them blamed 
<A NAME="68"></A>the son of Saturn for wanting to Live victory to the Trojans, but father 
<A NAME="69"></A>Jove heeded them not: he held aloof from all, and sat apart in his all-glorious 
<A NAME="70"></A>majesty, looking down upon the city of the Trojans, the ships of the Achaeans, 
<A NAME="71"></A>the gleam of bronze, and alike upon the slayers and on the 
<A NAME="72"></A>slain.
<A NAME="73"></A><BR><BR>Now so long as the day waxed and it was still morning, their darts 
<A NAME="74"></A>rained thick on one another and the people perished, but as the hour drew 
<A NAME="75"></A>nigh when a woodman working in some mountain forest will get his midday 
<A NAME="76"></A>meal- for he has felled till his hands are weary; he is tired out, and 
<A NAME="77"></A>must now have food- then the Danaans with a cry that rang through all their 
<A NAME="78"></A>ranks, broke the battalions of the enemy. Agamemnon led them on, and slew 
<A NAME="79"></A>first Bienor, a leader of his people, and afterwards his comrade and charioteer 
<A NAME="80"></A>Oileus, who sprang from his chariot and was coming full towards him; but 
<A NAME="81"></A>Agamemnon struck him on the forehead with his spear; his bronze visor was 
<A NAME="82"></A>of no avail against the weapon, which pierced both bronze and bone, so 
<A NAME="83"></A>that his brains were battered in and he was killed in full 
<A NAME="84"></A>fight.
<A NAME="85"></A><BR><BR>Agamemnon stripped their shirts from off them and left them with 
<A NAME="86"></A>their breasts all bare to lie where they had fallen. He then went on to 
<A NAME="87"></A>kill Isus and Antiphus two sons of Priam, the one a bastard, the other 
<A NAME="88"></A>born in wedlock; they were in the same chariot- the bastard driving, while 
<A NAME="89"></A>noble Antiphus fought beside him. Achilles had once taken both of them 
<A NAME="90"></A>prisoners in the glades of Ida, and had bound them with fresh withes as 
<A NAME="91"></A>they were shepherding, but he had taken a ransom for them; now, however, 
<A NAME="92"></A>Agamemnon son of Atreus smote Isus in the chest above the nipple with his 
<A NAME="93"></A>spear, while he struck Antiphus hard by the ear and threw him from his 
<A NAME="94"></A>chariot. Forthwith he stripped their goodly armour from off them and recognized 
<A NAME="95"></A>them, for he had already seen them at ships when Achilles brought them 
<A NAME="96"></A>in from Ida. As a lion fastens on the fawns of a hind and crushes them 
<A NAME="97"></A>in his great jaws, robbing them of their tender life while he on his way 
<A NAME="98"></A>back to his lair- the hind can do nothing for them even though she be close 
<A NAME="99"></A>by, for she is in an agony of fear, and flies through the thick forest, 
<A NAME="100"></A>sweating, and at her utmost speed before the mighty monster- so, no man 
<A NAME="101"></A>of the Trojans could help Isus and Antiphus, for they were themselves flying 
<A NAME="102"></A>panic before the Argives.
<A NAME="103"></A><BR><BR>Then King Agamemnon took the two sons of Antimachus, Pisander and 
<A NAME="104"></A>brave Hippolochus. It was Antimachus who had been foremost in preventing 
<A NAME="105"></A>Helen's being restored to Menelaus, for he was largely bribed by Alexandrus; 
<A NAME="106"></A>and now Agamemnon took his two sons, both in the same chariot, trying to 
<A NAME="107"></A>bring their horses to a stand- for they had lost hold of the reins and 
<A NAME="108"></A>the horses were mad with fear. The son of Atreus sprang upon them like 
<A NAME="109"></A>a lion, and the pair besought him from their chariot. "Take us alive," 
<A NAME="110"></A>they cried, "son of Atreus, and you shall receive a great ransom for us. 
<A NAME="111"></A>Our father Antimachus has great store of gold, bronze, and wrought iron, 
<A NAME="112"></A>and from this he will satisfy you with a very large ransom should he hear 
<A NAME="113"></A>of our being alive at the ships of the Achaeans."
<A NAME="114"></A><BR><BR>With such piteous words and tears did they beseech the king, but 
<A NAME="115"></A>they heard no pitiful answer in return. "If," said Agamemnon, "you are 
<A NAME="116"></A>sons of Antimachus, who once at a council of Trojans proposed that Menelaus 
<A NAME="117"></A>and Ulysses, who had come to you as envoys, should be killed and not suffered 
<A NAME="118"></A>to return, you shall now pay for the foul iniquity of your 
<A NAME="119"></A>father."
<A NAME="120"></A><BR><BR>As he spoke he felled Pisander from his chariot to the earth, smiting 
<A NAME="121"></A>him on the chest with his spear, so that he lay face uppermost upon the 
<A NAME="122"></A>ground. Hippolochus fled, but him too did Agamemnon smite; he cut off his 
<A NAME="123"></A>hands and his head- which he sent rolling in among the crowd as though 
<A NAME="124"></A>it were a ball. There he let them both lie, and wherever the ranks were 
<A NAME="125"></A>thickest thither he flew, while the other Achaeans followed. Foot soldiers 
<A NAME="126"></A>drove the foot soldiers of the foe in rout before them, and slew them; 
<A NAME="127"></A>horsemen did the like by horsemen, and the thundering tramp of the horses 
<A NAME="128"></A>raised a cloud of dust frim off the plain. King Agamemnon followed after, 
<A NAME="129"></A>ever slaying them and cheering on the Achaeans. As when some mighty forest 
<A NAME="130"></A>is all ablaze- the eddying gusts whirl fire in all directions till the 
<A NAME="131"></A>thickets shrivel and are consumed before the blast of the flame- even so 
<A NAME="132"></A>fell the heads of the flying Trojans before Agamemnon son of Atreus, and 
<A NAME="133"></A>many a noble pair of steeds drew an empty chariot along the highways of 
<A NAME="134"></A>war, for lack of drivers who were lying on the plain, more useful now to 
<A NAME="135"></A>vultures than to their wives.
<A NAME="136"></A><BR><BR>Jove drew Hector away from the darts and dust, with the carnage 
<A NAME="137"></A>and din of battle; but the son of Atreus sped onwards, calling out lustily 
<A NAME="138"></A>to the Danaans. They flew on by the tomb of old Ilus, son of Dardanus, 
<A NAME="139"></A>in the middle of the plain, and past the place of the wild fig-tree making 
<A NAME="140"></A>always for the city- the son of Atreus still shouting, and with hands all 
<A NAME="141"></A>bedrabbled in gore; but when they had reached the Scaean gates and the 
<A NAME="142"></A>oak tree, there they halted and waited for the others to come up. Meanwhile 
<A NAME="143"></A>the Trojans kept on flying over the middle of the plain like a herd cows 
<A NAME="144"></A>maddened with fright when a lion has attacked them in the dead of night- 
<A NAME="145"></A>he springs on one of them, seizes her neck in the grip of his strong teeth 
<A NAME="146"></A>and then laps up her blood and gorges himself upon her entrails- even so 
<A NAME="147"></A>did King Agamemnon son of Atreus pursue the foe, ever slaughtering the 
<A NAME="148"></A>hindmost as they fled pell-mell before him. Many a man was flung headlong 
<A NAME="149"></A>from his chariot by the hand of the son of Atreus, for he wielded his spear 
<A NAME="150"></A>with fury.
<A NAME="151"></A><BR><BR>But when he was just about to reach the high wall and the city, 
<A NAME="152"></A>the father of gods and men came down from heaven and took his seat, thunderbolt 
<A NAME="153"></A>in hand, upon the crest of many-fountained Ida. He then told Iris of the 
<A NAME="154"></A>golden wings to carry a message for him. "Go," said he, "fleet Iris, and 
<A NAME="155"></A>speak thus to Hector-  say that so long as he sees Agamemnon heading his 
<A NAME="156"></A>men and making havoc of the Trojan ranks, he is to keep aloof and bid the 
<A NAME="157"></A>others bear the brunt of the battle, but when Agamemnon is wounded either 
<A NAME="158"></A>by spear or arrow, and takes to his chariot, then will I vouchsafe him 
<A NAME="159"></A>strength to slay till he reach the ships and night falls at the going down 
<A NAME="160"></A>of the sun."
<A NAME="161"></A><BR><BR>Iris hearkened and obeyed. Down she went to strong Ilius from the 
<A NAME="162"></A>crests of Ida, and found Hector son of Priam standing by his chariot and 
<A NAME="163"></A>horses. Then she said, "Hector son of Priam, peer of gods in counsel, father 
<A NAME="164"></A>Jove has sent me to bear you this message- so long as you see Agamemnon 
<A NAME="165"></A>heading his men and making havoc of the Trojan ranks, you are to keep aloof 
<A NAME="166"></A>and bid the others bear the brunt of the battle, but when Agamemnon is 
<A NAME="167"></A>wounded either by spear or arrow, and takes to his chariot, then will Jove 
<A NAME="168"></A>vouchsafe you strength to slay till you reach the ships, and till night 
<A NAME="169"></A>falls at the going down of the sun."
<A NAME="170"></A><BR><BR>When she had thus spoken Iris left him, and Hector sprang full 
<A NAME="171"></A>armed from his chariot to the ground, brandishing his spear as he went 
<A NAME="172"></A>about everywhere among the host, cheering his men on to fight, and stirring 
<A NAME="173"></A>the dread strife of battle. The Trojans then wheeled round, and again met 
<A NAME="174"></A>the Achaeans, while the Argives on their part strengthened their battalions. 
<A NAME="175"></A>The battle was now in array and they stood face to face with one another, 
<A NAME="176"></A>Agamemnon ever pressing forward in his eagerness to be ahead of all 
<A NAME="177"></A>others.
<A NAME="178"></A><BR><BR>Tell me now ye Muses that dwell in the mansions of Olympus, who, 
<A NAME="179"></A>whether of the Trojans or of their allies, was first to face Agamemnon? 
<A NAME="180"></A>It was Iphidamas son of Antenor, a man both brave and of great stature, 
<A NAME="181"></A>who was brought up in fertile Thrace the mother of sheep. Cisses, his mother's 
<A NAME="182"></A>father, brought him up in his own house when he was a child- Cisses, father 
<A NAME="183"></A>to fair Theano. When he reached manhood, Cisses would have kept him there, 
<A NAME="184"></A>and was for giving him his daughter in marriage, but as soon as he had 
<A NAME="185"></A>married he set out to fight the Achaeans with twelve ships that followed 
<A NAME="186"></A>him: these he had left at Percote and had come on by land to Ilius. He 
<A NAME="187"></A>it was that naw met Agamemnon son of Atreus. When they were close up with 
<A NAME="188"></A>one another, the son of Atreus missed his aim, and Iphidamas hit him on 
<A NAME="189"></A>the girdle below the cuirass and then flung himself upon him, trusting 
<A NAME="190"></A>to his strength of arm; the girdle, however, was not pierced, nor nearly 
<A NAME="191"></A>so, for the point of the spear struck against the silver and was turned 
<A NAME="192"></A>aside as though it had been lead: King Agamemnon caught it from his hand, 
<A NAME="193"></A>and drew it towards him with the fury of a lion; he then drew his sword, 
<A NAME="194"></A>and killed Iphidamas by striking him on the neck. So there the poor fellow 
<A NAME="195"></A>lay, sleeping a sleep as it were of bronze, killed in the defence of his 
<A NAME="196"></A>fellow-citizens, far from his wedded wife, of whom he had had no joy though 
<A NAME="197"></A>he had given much for her: he had given a hundred-head of cattle down, 
<A NAME="198"></A>and had promised later on to give a thousand sheep and goats mixed, from 
<A NAME="199"></A>the countless flocks of which he was possessed. Agamemnon son of Atreus 
<A NAME="200"></A>then despoiled him, and carried off his armour into the host of the 
<A NAME="201"></A>Achaeans.
<A NAME="202"></A><BR><BR>When noble Coon, Antenor's eldest son, saw this, sore indeed were 
<A NAME="203"></A>his eyes at the sight of his fallen brother. Unseen by Agamemnon he got 
<A NAME="204"></A>beside him, spear in hand, and wounded him in the middle of his arm below 
<A NAME="205"></A>the elbow, the point of the spear going right through the arm. Agamemnon 
<A NAME="206"></A>was convulsed with pain, but still not even for this did he leave off struggling 
<A NAME="207"></A>and fighting, but grasped his spear that flew as fleet as the wind, and 
<A NAME="208"></A>sprang upon Coon who was trying to drag off the body of his brother- his 
<A NAME="209"></A>father's son- by the foot, and was crying for help to all the bravest of 
<A NAME="210"></A>his comrades; but Agamemnon struck him with a bronze-shod spear and killed 
<A NAME="211"></A>him as he was dragging the dead body through the press of men under cover 
<A NAME="212"></A>of his shield: he then cut off his head, standing over the body of Iphidamas. 
<A NAME="213"></A>Thus did the sons of Antenor meet their fate at the hands of the son of 
<A NAME="214"></A>Atreus, and go down into the house of Hades.
<A NAME="215"></A><BR><BR>As long as the blood still welled warm from his wound Agamemnon 
<A NAME="216"></A>went about attacking the ranks of the enemy with spear and sword and with 
<A NAME="217"></A>great handfuls of stone, but when the blood had ceased to flow and the 
<A NAME="218"></A>wound grew dry, the pain became great. As the sharp pangs which the Eilithuiae, 
<A NAME="219"></A>goddesses of childbirth, daughters of Juno and dispensers of cruel pain, 
<A NAME="220"></A>send upon a woman when she is in labour- even so sharp were the pangs of 
<A NAME="221"></A>the son of Atreus. He sprang on to his chariot, and bade his charioteer 
<A NAME="222"></A>drive to the ships, for he was in great agony. With a loud clear voice 
<A NAME="223"></A>he shouted to the Danaans, "My friends, princes and counsellors of the 
<A NAME="224"></A>Argives, defend the ships yourselves, for Jove has not suffered me to fight 
<A NAME="225"></A>the whole day through against the Trojans."
<A NAME="226"></A><BR><BR>With this the charioteer turned his horses towards the ships, and 
<A NAME="227"></A>they flew forward nothing loth. Their chests were white with foam and their 
<A NAME="228"></A>bellies with dust, as they drew the wounded king out of the 
<A NAME="229"></A>battle.
<A NAME="230"></A><BR><BR>When Hector saw Agamemnon quit the field, he shouted to the Trojans 
<A NAME="231"></A>and Lycians saying, "Trojans, Lycians, and Dardanian warriors, be men, 
<A NAME="232"></A>my friends, and acquit yourselves in battle bravely; their best man has 
<A NAME="233"></A>left them, and Jove has vouchsafed me a great triumph; charge the foe with 
<A NAME="234"></A>your chariots that. you may win still greater glory."
<A NAME="235"></A><BR><BR>With these words he put heart and soul into them all, and as a 
<A NAME="236"></A>huntsman hounds his dogs on against a lion or wild boar, even so did Hector, 
<A NAME="237"></A>peer of Mars, hound the proud Trojans on against the Achaeans. Full of 
<A NAME="238"></A>hope he plunged in among the foremost, and fell on the fight like some 
<A NAME="239"></A>fierce tempest that swoops down upon the sea, and lashes its deep blue 
<A NAME="240"></A>waters into fury.
<A NAME="241"></A><BR><BR>What, then is the full tale of those whom Hector son of Priam killed 
<A NAME="242"></A>in the hour of triumph which Jove then vouchsafed him? First Asaeus, Autonous, 
<A NAME="243"></A>and Opites; Dolops son of Clytius, Opheltius and Agelaus; Aesymnus, Orus 
<A NAME="244"></A>and Hipponous steadfast in battle; these chieftains of the Achaeans did 
<A NAME="245"></A>Hector slay, and then he fell upon the rank and file. As when the west 
<A NAME="246"></A>wind hustles the clouds of the white south and beats them down with the 
<A NAME="247"></A>fierceness of its fury- the waves of the sea roll high, and the spray is 
<A NAME="248"></A>flung aloft in the rage of the wandering wind- even so thick were the heads 
<A NAME="249"></A>of them that fell by the hand of Hector.
<A NAME="250"></A><BR><BR>All had then been lost and no help for it, and the Achaeans would 
<A NAME="251"></A>have fled pell-mell to their ships, had not Ulysses cried out to Diomed, 
<A NAME="252"></A>"Son of Tydeus, what has happened to us that we thus forget our prowess? 
<A NAME="253"></A>Come, my good fellow, stand by my side and help me, we shall be shamed 
<A NAME="254"></A>for ever if Hector takes the ships."
<A NAME="255"></A><BR><BR>And Diomed answered, "Come what may, I will stand firm; but we 
<A NAME="256"></A>shall have scant joy of it, for Jove is minded to give victory to the Trojans 
<A NAME="257"></A>rather than to us."
<A NAME="258"></A><BR><BR>With these words he struck Thymbraeus from his chariot to the ground, 
<A NAME="259"></A>smiting him in the left breast with his spear, while Ulysses killed Molion 
<A NAME="260"></A>who was his squire. These they let lie, now that they had stopped their 
<A NAME="261"></A>fighting; the two heroes then went on playing havoc with the foe, like 
<A NAME="262"></A>two wild boars that turn in fury and rend the hounds that hunt them. Thus 
<A NAME="263"></A>did they turn upon the Trojans and slay them, and the Achaeans were thankful 
<A NAME="264"></A>to have breathing time in their flight from Hector.
<A NAME="265"></A><BR><BR>They then took two princes with their chariot, the two sons of 
<A NAME="266"></A>Merops of Percote, who excelled all others in the arts of divination. He 
<A NAME="267"></A>had forbidden his sons to go to the war, but they would not obey him, for 
<A NAME="268"></A>fate lured them to their fall. Diomed son of Tydeus slew them both and 
<A NAME="269"></A>stripped them of their armour, while Ulysses killed Hippodamus and 
<A NAME="270"></A>Hypeirochus.
<A NAME="271"></A><BR><BR>And now the son of Saturn as he looked down from Ida ordained that 
<A NAME="272"></A>neither side should have the advantage, and they kept on killing one another. 
<A NAME="273"></A>The son of Tydeus speared Agastrophus son of Paeon in the hip-joint with 
<A NAME="274"></A>his spear. His chariot was not at hand for him to fly with, so blindly 
<A NAME="275"></A>confident had he been. His squire was in charge of it at some distance 
<A NAME="276"></A>and he was fighting on foot among the foremost until he lost his life. 
<A NAME="277"></A>Hector soon marked the havoc Diomed and Ulysses were making, and bore down 
<A NAME="278"></A>upon them with a loud cry, followed by the Trojan ranks; brave Diomed was 
<A NAME="279"></A>dismayed when he saw them, and said to Ulysses who was beside him, "Great 
<A NAME="280"></A>Hector is bearing down upon us and we shall be undone; let us stand firm 
<A NAME="281"></A>and wait his onset."
<A NAME="282"></A><BR><BR>He poised his spear as he spoke and hurled it, nor did he miss 
<A NAME="283"></A>his mark. He had aimed at Hector's head near the top of his helmet, but 
<A NAME="284"></A>bronze was turned by bronze, and Hector was untouched, for the spear was 
<A NAME="285"></A>stayed by the visored helm made with three plates of metal, which Phoebus 
<A NAME="286"></A>Apollo had given him. Hector sprang back with a great bound under cover 
<A NAME="287"></A>of the ranks; he fell on his knees and propped himself with his brawny 
<A NAME="288"></A>hand leaning on the ground, for darkness had fallen on his eyes. The son 
<A NAME="289"></A>of Tydeus having thrown his spear dashed in among the foremost fighters, 
<A NAME="290"></A>to the place where he had seen it strike the ground; meanwhile Hector recovered 
<A NAME="291"></A>himself and springing back into his chariot mingled with the crowd, by 
<A NAME="292"></A>which means he saved his life. But Diomed made at him with his spear and 
<A NAME="293"></A>said, "Dog, you have again got away though death was close on your heels. 
<A NAME="294"></A>Phoebus Apollo, to whom I ween you pray ere you go into battle, has again 
<A NAME="295"></A>saved you, nevertheless I will meet you and make and end of you hereafter, 
<A NAME="296"></A>if there is any god who will stand by me too and be my helper. For the 
<A NAME="297"></A>present I must pursue those I can lay hands on."
<A NAME="298"></A><BR><BR>As he spoke he began stripping the spoils from the son of Paeon, 
<A NAME="299"></A>but Alexandrus husband of lovely Helen aimed an arrow at him, leaning against 
<A NAME="300"></A>a pillar of the monument which men had raised to Ilus son of Dardanus, 
<A NAME="301"></A>a ruler in days of old. Diomed had taken the cuirass from off the breast 
<A NAME="302"></A>of Agastrophus, his heavy helmet also, and the shield from off his shoulders, 
<A NAME="303"></A>when Paris drew his bow and let fly an arrow that sped not from his hand 
<A NAME="304"></A>in vain, but pierced the flat of Diomed's right foot, going right through 
<A NAME="305"></A>it and fixing itself in the ground. Thereon Paris with a hearty laugh sprang 
<A NAME="306"></A>forward from his hiding-place, and taunted him saying, "You are wounded- 
<A NAME="307"></A>my arrow has not been shot in vain; would that it had hit you in the belly 
<A NAME="308"></A>and killed you, for thus the Trojans, who fear you as goats fear a lion, 
<A NAME="309"></A>would have had a truce from evil."
<A NAME="310"></A><BR><BR>Diomed all undaunted answered, "Archer, you who without your bow 
<A NAME="311"></A>are nothing, slanderer and seducer, if you were to be tried in single combat 
<A NAME="312"></A>fighting in full armour, your bow and your arrows would serve you in little 
<A NAME="313"></A>stead. Vain is your boast in that you have scratched the sole of my foot. 
<A NAME="314"></A>I care no more than if a girl or some silly boy had hit me. A worthless 
<A NAME="315"></A>coward can inflict but a light wound; when I wound a man though I but graze 
<A NAME="316"></A>his skin it is another matter, for my weapon will lay him low. His wife 
<A NAME="317"></A>will tear her cheeks for grief and his children will be fatherless: there 
<A NAME="318"></A>will he rot, reddening the earth with his blood, and vultures, not women, 
<A NAME="319"></A>will gather round him."
<A NAME="320"></A><BR><BR>Thus he spoke, but Ulysses came up and stood over him. Under this 
<A NAME="321"></A>cover he sat down to draw the arrow from his foot, and sharp was the pain 
<A NAME="322"></A>he suffered as he did so. Then he sprang on to his chariot and bade the 
<A NAME="323"></A>charioteer drive him to the ships, for he was sick at 
<A NAME="324"></A>heart.
<A NAME="325"></A><BR><BR>Ulysses was now alone; not one of the Argives stood by him, for 
<A NAME="326"></A>they were all panic-stricken. "Alas," said he to himself in his dismay, 
<A NAME="327"></A>"what will become of me? It is ill if I turn and fly before these odds, 
<A NAME="328"></A>but it will be worse if I am left alone and taken prisoner, for the son 
<A NAME="329"></A>of Saturn has struck the rest of the Danaans with panic. But why talk to 
<A NAME="330"></A>myself in this way? Well do I know that though cowards quit the field, 
<A NAME="331"></A>a hero, whether he wound or be wounded, must stand firm and hold his 
<A NAME="332"></A>own."
<A NAME="333"></A><BR><BR>While he was thus in two minds, the ranks of the Trojans advanced 
<A NAME="334"></A>and hemmed him in, and bitterly did they come to me it. As hounds and lusty 
<A NAME="335"></A>youths set upon a wild boar that sallies from his lair whetting his white 
<A NAME="336"></A>tusks- they attack him from every side and can hear the gnashing of his 
<A NAME="337"></A>jaws, but for all his fierceness they still hold their ground- even so 
<A NAME="338"></A>furiously did the Trojans attack Ulysses. First he sprang spear in hand 
<A NAME="339"></A>upon Deiopites and wounded him on the shoulder with a downward blow; then 
<A NAME="340"></A>he killed Thoon and Ennomus. After these he struck Chersidamas in the loins 
<A NAME="341"></A>under his shield as he had just sprung down from his chariot; so he fell 
<A NAME="342"></A>in the dust and clutched the earth in the hollow of his hand. These he 
<A NAME="343"></A>let lie, and went on to wound Charops son of Hippasus own brother to noble 
<A NAME="344"></A>Socus. Socus, hero that he was, made all speed to help him, and when he 
<A NAME="345"></A>was close to Ulysses he said, "Far-famed Ulysses, insatiable of craft and 
<A NAME="346"></A>toil, this day you shall either boast of having killed both the sons of 
<A NAME="347"></A>Hippasus and stripped them of their armour, or you shall fall before my 
<A NAME="348"></A>spear."
<A NAME="349"></A><BR><BR>With these words he struck the shield of Ulysses. The spear went 
<A NAME="350"></A>through the shield and passed on through his richly wrought cuirass, tearing 
<A NAME="351"></A>the flesh from his side, but Pallas Minerva did not suffer it to pierce 
<A NAME="352"></A>the entrails of the hero. Ulysses knew that his hour was not yet come, 
<A NAME="353"></A>but he gave ground and said to Socus, "Wretch, you shall now surely die. 
<A NAME="354"></A>You have stayed me from fighting further with the Trojans, but you shall 
<A NAME="355"></A>now fall by my spear, yielding glory to myself, and your soul to Hades 
<A NAME="356"></A>of the noble steeds."
<A NAME="357"></A><BR><BR>Socus had turned in flight, but as he did so, the spear struck 
<A NAME="358"></A>him in the back midway between the shoulders, and went right through his 
<A NAME="359"></A>chest. He fell heavily to the ground and Ulysses vaunted over him saying, 
<A NAME="360"></A>"O Socus, son of Hippasus tamer of horses, death has been too quick for 
<A NAME="361"></A>you and you have not escaped him: poor wretch, not even in death shall 
<A NAME="362"></A>your father and mother close your eyes, but the ravening vultures shall 
<A NAME="363"></A>enshroud you with the flapping of their dark wings and devour you. Whereas 
<A NAME="364"></A>even though I fall the Achaeans will give me my due rites of 
<A NAME="365"></A>burial."
<A NAME="366"></A><BR><BR>So saying he drew Socus's heavy spear out of his flesh and from 
<A NAME="367"></A>his shield, and the blood welled forth when the spear was withdrawn so 
<A NAME="368"></A>that he was much dismayed. When the Trojans saw that Ulysses was bleeding 
<A NAME="369"></A>they raised a great shout and came on in a body towards him; he therefore 
<A NAME="370"></A>gave ground, and called his comrades to come and help him. Thrice did he 
<A NAME="371"></A>cry as loudly as man can cry, and thrice did brave Menelaus hear him; he 
<A NAME="372"></A>turned, therefore, to Ajax who was close beside him and said, "Ajax, noble 
<A NAME="373"></A>son of Telamon, captain of your people, the cry of Ulysses rings in my 
<A NAME="374"></A>ears, as though the Trojans had cut him off and were worsting him while 
<A NAME="375"></A>he is single-handed. Let us make our way through the throng; it will be 
<A NAME="376"></A>well that we defend him; I fear he may come to harm for all his valour 
<A NAME="377"></A>if he be left without support, and the Danaans would miss him 
<A NAME="378"></A>sorely."
<A NAME="379"></A><BR><BR>He led the way and mighty Ajax went with him. The Trojans had gathered 
<A NAME="380"></A>round Ulysses like ravenous mountain jackals round the carcase of some 
<A NAME="381"></A>homed stag that has been hit with an arrow- the stag has fled at full speed 
<A NAME="382"></A>so long as his blood was warm and his strength has lasted, but when the 
<A NAME="383"></A>arrow has overcome him, the savage jackals devour him in the shady glades 
<A NAME="384"></A>of the forest. Then heaven sends a fierce lion thither, whereon the jackals 
<A NAME="385"></A>fly in terror and the lion robs them of their prey- even so did Trojans 
<A NAME="386"></A>many and brave gather round crafty Ulysses, but the hero stood at bay and 
<A NAME="387"></A>kept them off with his spear. Ajax then came up with his shield before 
<A NAME="388"></A>him like a wall, and stood hard by, whereon the Trojans fled in all directions. 
<A NAME="389"></A>Menelaus took Ulysses by the hand, and led him out of the press while his 
<A NAME="390"></A>squire brought up his chariot, but Ajax rushed furiously on the Trojans 
<A NAME="391"></A>and killed Doryclus, a bastard son of Priam; then he wounded Pandocus, 
<A NAME="392"></A>Lysandrus, Pyrasus, and Pylartes; as some swollen torrent comes rushing 
<A NAME="393"></A>in full flood from the mountains on to the plain, big with the rain of 
<A NAME="394"></A>heaven- many a dry oak and many a pine does it engulf, and much mud does 
<A NAME="395"></A>it bring down and cast into the sea- even so did brave Ajax chase the foe 
<A NAME="396"></A>furiously over the plain, slaying both men and horses.
<A NAME="397"></A><BR><BR>Hector did not yet know what Ajax was doing, for he was fighting 
<A NAME="398"></A>on the extreme left of the battle by the banks of the river Scamander, 
<A NAME="399"></A>where the carnage was thickest and the war-cry loudest round Nestor and 
<A NAME="400"></A>brave Idomeneus. Among these Hector was making great slaughter with his 
<A NAME="401"></A>spear and furious driving, and was destroying the ranks that were opposed 
<A NAME="402"></A>to him; still the Achaeans would have given no ground, had not Alexandrus 
<A NAME="403"></A>husband of lovely Helen stayed the prowess of Machaon shepherd of his people, 
<A NAME="404"></A>by wounding him in the right shoulder with a triple-barbed arrow. The Achaeans 
<A NAME="405"></A>were in great fear that as the fight had turned against them the Trojans 
<A NAME="406"></A>might take him prisoner, and Idomeneus said to Nestor, "Nestor son of Neleus, 
<A NAME="407"></A>honour to the Achaean name, mount your chariot at once; take Machaon with 
<A NAME="408"></A>you and drive your horses to the ships as fast as you can. A physician 
<A NAME="409"></A>is worth more than several other men put together, for he can cut out arrows 
<A NAME="410"></A>and spread healing herbs."
<A NAME="411"></A><BR><BR>Nestor knight of Gerene did as Idomeneus had counselled; he at 
<A NAME="412"></A>once mounted his chariot, and Machaon son of the famed physician Aesculapius 
<A NAME="413"></A>went with him. He lashed his horses and they flew onward nothing loth towards 
<A NAME="414"></A>the ships, as though of their own free will.
<A NAME="415"></A><BR><BR>Then Cebriones seeing the Trojans in confusion said to Hector from 
<A NAME="416"></A>his place beside him, "Hector, here are we two fighting on the extreme 
<A NAME="417"></A>wing of the battle, while the other Trojans are in pell-mell rout, they 
<A NAME="418"></A>and their horses. Ajax son of Telamon is driving them before him; I know 
<A NAME="419"></A>him by the breadth of his shield: let us turn our chariot and horses thither, 
<A NAME="420"></A>where horse and foot are fighting most desperately, and where the cry of 
<A NAME="421"></A>battle is loudest."
<A NAME="422"></A><BR><BR>With this he lashed his goodly steeds, and when they felt the whip 
<A NAME="423"></A>they drew the chariot full speed among the Achaeans and Trojans, over the 
<A NAME="424"></A>bodies and shields of those that had fallen: the axle was bespattered with 
<A NAME="425"></A>blood, and the rail round the car was covered with splashes both from the 
<A NAME="426"></A>horses' hoofs and from the tyres of the wheels. Hector tore his way through 
<A NAME="427"></A>and flung himself into the thick of the fight, and his presence threw the 
<A NAME="428"></A>Danaans into confusion, for his spear was not long idle; nevertheless though 
<A NAME="429"></A>he went among the ranks with sword and spear, and throwing great stones, 
<A NAME="430"></A>he avoided Ajax son of Telamon, for Jove would have been angry with him 
<A NAME="431"></A>if he had fought a better man than himself.
<A NAME="432"></A><BR><BR>Then father Jove from his high throne struck fear into the heart 
<A NAME="433"></A>of Ajax, so that he stood there dazed and threw his shield behind him- 
<A NAME="434"></A>looking fearfully at the throng of his foes as though he were some wild 
<A NAME="435"></A>beast, and turning hither and thither but crouching slowly backwards. As 
<A NAME="436"></A>peasants with their hounds chase a lion from their stockyard, and watch 
<A NAME="437"></A>by night to prevent his carrying off the pick of their herd- he makes his 
<A NAME="438"></A>greedy spring, but in vain, for the darts from many a strong hand fall 
<A NAME="439"></A>thick around him, with burning brands that scare him for all his fury, 
<A NAME="440"></A>and when morning comes he slinks foiled and angry away- even so did Ajax, 
<A NAME="441"></A>sorely against his will, retreat angrily before the Trojans, fearing for 
<A NAME="442"></A>the ships of the Achaeans. Or as some lazy ass that has had many a cudgel 
<A NAME="443"></A>broken about his back, when he into a field begins eating the corn- boys 
<A NAME="444"></A>beat him but he is too many for them, and though they lay about with their 
<A NAME="445"></A>sticks they cannot hurt him; still when he has had his fill they at last 
<A NAME="446"></A>drive him from the field- even so did the Trojans and their allies pursue 
<A NAME="447"></A>great Ajax, ever smiting the middle of his shield with their darts. Now 
<A NAME="448"></A>and again he would turn and show fight, keeping back the battalions of 
<A NAME="449"></A>the Trojans, and then he would again retreat; but he prevented any of them 
<A NAME="450"></A>from making his way to the ships. Single-handed he stood midway between 
<A NAME="451"></A>the Trojans and Achaeans: the spears that sped from their hands stuck some 
<A NAME="452"></A>of them in his mighty shield, while many, though thirsting for his blood, 
<A NAME="453"></A>fell to the ground ere they could reach him to the wounding of his fair 
<A NAME="454"></A>flesh.
<A NAME="455"></A><BR><BR>Now when Eurypylus the brave son of Euaemon saw that Ajax was being 
<A NAME="456"></A>overpowered by the rain of arrows, he went up to him and hurled his spear. 
<A NAME="457"></A>He struck Apisaon son of Phausius in the liver below the midriff, and laid 
<A NAME="458"></A>him low. Eurypylus sprang upon him, and stripped the armour from his shoulders; 
<A NAME="459"></A>but when Alexandrus saw him, he aimed an arrow at him which struck him 
<A NAME="460"></A>in the right thigh; the arrow broke, but the point that was left in the 
<A NAME="461"></A>wound dragged on the thigh; he drew back, therefore, under cover of his 
<A NAME="462"></A>comrades to save his life, shouting as he did so to the Danaans, "My friends, 
<A NAME="463"></A>princes and counsellors of the Argives, rally to the defence of Ajax who 
<A NAME="464"></A>is being overpowered, and I doubt whether he will come out of the fight 
<A NAME="465"></A>alive. Hither, then, to the rescue of great Ajax son of 
<A NAME="466"></A>Telamon."
<A NAME="467"></A><BR><BR>Even so did he cry when he was wounded; thereon the others came 
<A NAME="468"></A>near, and gathered round him, holding their shields upwards from their 
<A NAME="469"></A>shoulders so as to give him cover. Ajax then made towards them, and turned 
<A NAME="470"></A>round to stand at bay as soon as he had reached his 
<A NAME="471"></A>men.
<A NAME="472"></A><BR><BR>Thus then did they fight as it were a flaming fire. Meanwhile the 
<A NAME="473"></A>mares of Neleus, all in a lather with sweat, were bearing Nestor out of 
<A NAME="474"></A>the fight, and with him Machaon shepherd of his people. Achilles saw and 
<A NAME="475"></A>took note, for he was standing on the stern of his ship watching the hard 
<A NAME="476"></A>stress and struggle of the fight. He called from the ship to his comrade 
<A NAME="477"></A>Patroclus, who heard him in the tent and came out looking like Mars himself- 
<A NAME="478"></A>here indeed was the beginning of the ill that presently befell him. "Why," 
<A NAME="479"></A>said he, "Achilles do you call me? what do you what do you want with me?" 
<A NAME="480"></A>And Achilles answered, "Noble son of Menoetius, man after my own heart, 
<A NAME="481"></A>I take it that I shall now have the Achaeans praying at my knees, for they 
<A NAME="482"></A>are in great straits; go, Patroclus, and ask Nestor who is that he is bearing 
<A NAME="483"></A>away wounded from the field; from his back I should say it was Machaon 
<A NAME="484"></A>son of Aesculapius, but I could not see his face for the horses went by 
<A NAME="485"></A>me at full speed."
<A NAME="486"></A><BR><BR>Patroclus did as his dear comrade had bidden him, and set off running 
<A NAME="487"></A>by the ships and tents of the Achaeans.
<A NAME="488"></A><BR><BR>When Nestor and Machaon had reached the tents of the son of Neleus, 
<A NAME="489"></A>they dismounted, and an esquire, Eurymedon, took the horses from the chariot. 
<A NAME="490"></A>The pair then stood in the breeze by the seaside to dry the sweat from 
<A NAME="491"></A>their shirts, and when they had so done they came inside and took their 
<A NAME="492"></A>seats. Fair Hecamede, whom Nestor had had awarded to him from Tenedos when 
<A NAME="493"></A>Achilles took it, mixed them a mess; she was daughter of wise Arsinous, 
<A NAME="494"></A>and the Achaeans had given her to Nestor because he excelled all of them 
<A NAME="495"></A>in counsel. First she set for them a fair and well-made table that had 
<A NAME="496"></A>feet of cyanus; on it there was a vessel of bronze and an onion to give 
<A NAME="497"></A>relish to the drink, with honey and cakes of barley-meal. There was also 
<A NAME="498"></A>a cup of rare workmanship which the old man had brought with him from home, 
<A NAME="499"></A>studded with bosses of gold; it had four handles, on each of which there 
<A NAME="500"></A>were two golden doves feeding, and it had two feet to stand on. Any one 
<A NAME="501"></A>else would hardly have been able to lift it from the table when it was 
<A NAME="502"></A>full, but Nestor could do so quite easily. In this the woman, as fair as 
<A NAME="503"></A>a goddess, mixed them a mess with Pramnian wine; she grated goat's milk 
<A NAME="504"></A>cheese into it with a bronze grater, threw in a handful of white barley-meal, 
<A NAME="505"></A>and having thus prepared the mess she bade them drink it. When they had 
<A NAME="506"></A>done so and had thus quenched their thirst, they fell talking with one 
<A NAME="507"></A>another, and at this moment Patroclus appeared at the 
<A NAME="508"></A>door.
<A NAME="509"></A><BR><BR>When the old man saw him he sprang from his seat, seized his hand, 
<A NAME="510"></A>led him into the tent, and bade him take his place among them; but Patroclus 
<A NAME="511"></A>stood where he was and said, "Noble sir, I may not stay, you cannot persuade 
<A NAME="512"></A>me to come in; he that sent me is not one to be trifled with, and he bade 
<A NAME="513"></A>me ask who the wounded man was whom you were bearing away from the field. 
<A NAME="514"></A>I can now see for myself that he is Machaon shepherd of his people. I must 
<A NAME="515"></A>go back and tell Achilles. You, sir, know what a terrible man he is, and 
<A NAME="516"></A>how ready to blame even where no blame should lie."
<A NAME="517"></A><BR><BR>And Nestor answered, "Why should Achilles care to know how many 
<A NAME="518"></A>of the Achaeans may be wounded? He recks not of the dismay that reigns 
<A NAME="519"></A>in our host; our most valiant chieftains lie disabled, brave Diomed son 
<A NAME="520"></A>of Tydeus is wounded; so are Ulysses and Agamemnon; Eurypylus has been 
<A NAME="521"></A>hit with an arrow in the thigh, and I have just been bringing this man 
<A NAME="522"></A>from the field- he too wounded- with an arrow; nevertheless Achilles, so 
<A NAME="523"></A>valiant though he be, cares not and knows no ruth. Will he wait till the 
<A NAME="524"></A>ships, do what we may, are in a blaze, and we perish one upon the other? 
<A NAME="525"></A>As for me, I have no strength nor stay in me any longer; would that I Were 
<A NAME="526"></A>still young and strong as in the days when there was a fight between us 
<A NAME="527"></A>and the men of Elis about some cattle-raiding. I then killed Itymoneus 
<A NAME="528"></A>the valiant son of Hypeirochus a dweller in Elis, as I was driving in the 
<A NAME="529"></A>spoil; he was hit by a dart thrown my hand while fighting in the front 
<A NAME="530"></A>rank in defence of his cows, so he fell and the country people around him 
<A NAME="531"></A>were in great fear. We drove off a vast quantity of booty from the plain, 
<A NAME="532"></A>fifty herds of cattle and as many flocks of sheep; fifty droves also of 
<A NAME="533"></A>pigs, and as many wide-spreading flocks of goats. Of horses moreover we 
<A NAME="534"></A>seized a hundred and fifty, all of them mares, and many had foals running 
<A NAME="535"></A>with them. All these did we drive by night to Pylus the city of Neleus, 
<A NAME="536"></A>taking them within the city; and the heart of Neleus was glad in that I 
<A NAME="537"></A>had taken so much, though it was the first time I had ever been in the 
<A NAME="538"></A>field. At daybreak the heralds went round crying that all in Elis to whom 
<A NAME="539"></A>there was a debt owing should come; and the leading Pylians assembled to 
<A NAME="540"></A>divide the spoils. There were many to whom the Epeans owed chattels, for 
<A NAME="541"></A>we men of Pylus were few and had been oppressed with wrong; in former years 
<A NAME="542"></A>Hercules had come, and had laid his hand heavy upon us, so that all our 
<A NAME="543"></A>best men had perished. Neleus had had twelve sons, but I alone was left; 
<A NAME="544"></A>the others had all been killed. The Epeans presuming upon all this had 
<A NAME="545"></A>looked down upon us and had done us much evil. My father chose a herd of 
<A NAME="546"></A>cattle and a great flock of sheep- three hundred in all- and he took their 
<A NAME="547"></A>shepherds with him, for there was a great debt due to him in Elis, to wit 
<A NAME="548"></A>four horses, winners of prizes. They and their chariots with them had gone 
<A NAME="549"></A>to the games and were to run for a tripod, but King Augeas took them, and 
<A NAME="550"></A>sent back their driver grieving for the loss of his horses. Neleus was 
<A NAME="551"></A>angered by what he had both said and done, and took great value in return, 
<A NAME="552"></A>but he divided the rest, that no man might have less than his full 
<A NAME="553"></A>share.
<A NAME="554"></A><BR><BR>"Thus did we order all things, and offer sacrifices to the gods 
<A NAME="555"></A>throughout the city; but three days afterwards the Epeans came in a body, 
<A NAME="556"></A>many in number, they and their chariots, in full array, and with them the 
<A NAME="557"></A>two Moliones in their armour, though they were still lads and unused to 
<A NAME="558"></A>fighting. Now there is a certain town, Thryoessa, perched upon a rock on 
<A NAME="559"></A>the river Alpheus, the border city Pylus; this they would destroy, and 
<A NAME="560"></A>pitched their camp about it, but when they had crossed their whole plain, 
<A NAME="561"></A>Minerva darted down by night from Olympus and bade us set ourselves in 
<A NAME="562"></A>array; and she found willing soldiers in Pylos, for the men meant fighting. 
<A NAME="563"></A>Neleus would not let me arm, and hid my horses, for he said that as yet 
<A NAME="564"></A>I could know nothing about war; nevertheless Minerva so ordered the fight 
<A NAME="565"></A>that, all on foot as I was, I fought among our mounted forces and vied 
<A NAME="566"></A>with the foremost of them. There is a river Minyeius that falls into the 
<A NAME="567"></A>sea near Arene, and there they that were mounted (and I with them) waited 
<A NAME="568"></A>till morning, when the companies of foot soldiers came up with us in force. 
<A NAME="569"></A>Thence in full panoply and equipment we came towards noon to the sacred 
<A NAME="570"></A>waters of the Alpheus, and there we offered victims to almighty Jove, with 
<A NAME="571"></A>a bull to Alpheus, another to Neptune, and a herd-heifer to Minerva. After 
<A NAME="572"></A>this we took supper in our companies, and laid us down to rest each in 
<A NAME="573"></A>his armour by the river.
<A NAME="574"></A><BR><BR>"The Epeans were beleaguering the city and were determined to take 
<A NAME="575"></A>it, but ere this might be there was a desperate fight in store for them. 
<A NAME="576"></A>When the sun's rays began to fall upon the earth we joined battle, praying 
<A NAME="577"></A>to Jove and to Minerva, and when the fight had begun, I was the first to 
<A NAME="578"></A>kill my man and take his horses- to wit the warrior Mulius. He was son-in-law 
<A NAME="579"></A>to Augeas, having married his eldest daughter, golden-haired Agamede, who 
<A NAME="580"></A>knew the virtues of every herb which grows upon the face of the earth. 
<A NAME="581"></A>I speared him as he was coming towards me, and when he fell headlong in 
<A NAME="582"></A>the dust, I sprang upon his chariot and took my place in the front ranks. 
<A NAME="583"></A>The Epeans fled in all directions when they saw the captain of their horsemen 
<A NAME="584"></A>(the best man they had) laid low, and I swept down on them like a whirlwind, 
<A NAME="585"></A>taking fifty chariots- and in each of them two men bit the dust, slain 
<A NAME="586"></A>by my spear. I should have even killed the two Moliones sons of Actor, 
<A NAME="587"></A>unless their real father, Neptune lord of the earthquake, had hidden them 
<A NAME="588"></A>in a thick mist and borne them out of the fight. Thereon Jove vouchsafed 
<A NAME="589"></A>the Pylians a great victory, for we chased them far over the plain, killing 
<A NAME="590"></A>the men and bringing in their armour, till we had brought our horses to 
<A NAME="591"></A>Buprasium rich in wheat and to the Olenian rock, with the hill that is 
<A NAME="592"></A>called Alision, at which point Minerva turned the people back. There I 
<A NAME="593"></A>slew the last man and left him; then the Achaeans drove their horses back 
<A NAME="594"></A>from Buprasium to Pylos and gave thanks to Jove among the gods, and among 
<A NAME="595"></A>mortal men to Nestor.
<A NAME="596"></A><BR><BR>"Such was I among my peers, as surely as ever was, but Achilles 
<A NAME="597"></A>is for keeping all his valour for himself; bitterly will he rue it hereafter 
<A NAME="598"></A>when the host is being cut to pieces. My good friend, did not Menoetius 
<A NAME="599"></A>charge you thus, on the day when he sent you from Phthia to Agamemnon? 
<A NAME="600"></A>Ulysses and I were in the house, inside, and heard all that he said to 
<A NAME="601"></A>you; for we came to the fair house of Peleus while beating up recruits 
<A NAME="602"></A>throughout all Achaea, and when we got there we found Menoetius and yourself, 
<A NAME="603"></A>and Achilles with you. The old knight Peleus was in the outer court, roasting 
<A NAME="604"></A>the fat thigh-bones of a heifer to Jove the lord of thunder; and he held 
<A NAME="605"></A>a gold chalice in his hand from which he poured drink-offerings of wine 
<A NAME="606"></A>over the burning sacrifice. You two were busy cutting up the heifer, and 
<A NAME="607"></A>at that moment we stood at the gates, whereon Achilles sprang to his feet, 
<A NAME="608"></A>led us by the hand into the house, placed us at table, and set before us 
<A NAME="609"></A>such hospitable entertainment as guests expect. When we had satisfied ourselves 
<A NAME="610"></A>with meat and drink, I said my say and urged both of you to join us. You 
<A NAME="611"></A>were ready enough to do so, and the two old men charged you much and straitly. 
<A NAME="612"></A>Old Peleus bade his son Achilles fight ever among the foremost and outvie 
<A NAME="613"></A>his peers, while Menoetius the son of Actor spoke thus to you: 'My son,' 
<A NAME="614"></A>said he, 'Achilles is of nobler birth than you are, but you are older than 
<A NAME="615"></A>he, though he is far the better man of the two. Counsel him wisely, guide 
<A NAME="616"></A>him in the right way, and he will follow you to his own profit.' Thus did 
<A NAME="617"></A>your father charge you, but you have forgotten; nevertheless, even now, 
<A NAME="618"></A>say all this to Achilles if he will listen to you. Who knows but with heaven's 
<A NAME="619"></A>help you may talk him over, for it is good to take a friend's advice. If, 
<A NAME="620"></A>however, he is fearful about some oracle, or if his mother has told him 
<A NAME="621"></A>something from Jove, then let him send you, and let the rest of the Myrmidons 
<A NAME="622"></A>follow with you, if perchance you may bring light and saving to the Danaans. 
<A NAME="623"></A>And let him send you into battle clad in his own armour, that the Trojans 
<A NAME="624"></A>may mistake you for him and leave off fighting; the sons of the Achaeans 
<A NAME="625"></A>may thus have time to get their breath, for they are hard pressed and there 
<A NAME="626"></A>is little breathing time in battle. You, who are fresh, might easily drive 
<A NAME="627"></A>a tired enemy back to his walls and away from the tents and 
<A NAME="628"></A>ships."
<A NAME="629"></A><BR><BR>With these words he moved the heart of Patroclus, who set off running 
<A NAME="630"></A>by the line of the ships to Achilles, descendant of Aeacus. When he had 
<A NAME="631"></A>got as far as the ships of Ulysses, where was their place of assembly and 
<A NAME="632"></A>court of justice, with their altars dedicated to the gods, Eurypylus son 
<A NAME="633"></A>of Euaemon met him, wounded in the thigh with an arrow, and limping out 
<A NAME="634"></A>of the fight. Sweat rained from his head and shoulders, and black blood 
<A NAME="635"></A>welled from his cruel wound, but his mind did not wander. The son of Menoetius 
<A NAME="636"></A>when he saw him had compassion upon him and spoke piteously saying, "O 
<A NAME="637"></A>unhappy princes and counsellors of the Danaans, are you then doomed to 
<A NAME="638"></A>feed the hounds of Troy with your fat, far from your friends and your native 
<A NAME="639"></A>land? say, noble Eurypylus, will the Achaeans be able to hold great Hector 
<A NAME="640"></A>in check, or will they fall now before his spear?"
<A NAME="641"></A><BR><BR>Wounded Eurypylus made answer, "Noble Patroclus, there is no hope 
<A NAME="642"></A>left for the Achaeans but they will perish at their ships. All they that 
<A NAME="643"></A>were princes among us are lying struck down and wounded at the hands of 
<A NAME="644"></A>the Trojans, who are waxing stronger and stronger. But save me and take 
<A NAME="645"></A>me to your ship; cut out the arrow from my thigh; wash the black blood 
<A NAME="646"></A>from off it with warm water, and lay upon it those gracious herbs which, 
<A NAME="647"></A>so they say, have been shown you by Achilles, who was himself shown them 
<A NAME="648"></A>by Chiron, most righteous of all the centaurs. For of the physicians Podalirius 
<A NAME="649"></A>and Machaon, I hear that the one is lying wounded in his tent and is himself 
<A NAME="650"></A>in need of healing, while the other is fighting the Trojans upon the 
<A NAME="651"></A>plain."
<A NAME="652"></A><BR><BR>"Hero Eurypylus," replied the brave son of Menoetius, "how may 
<A NAME="653"></A>these things be? What can I do? I am on my way to bear a message to noble 
<A NAME="654"></A>Achilles from Nestor of Gerene, bulwark of the Achaeans, but even so I 
<A NAME="655"></A>will not be unmindful your distress."
<A NAME="656"></A><BR><BR>With this he clasped him round the middle and led him into the 
<A NAME="657"></A>tent, and a servant, when he saw him, spread bullock-skins on the ground 
<A NAME="658"></A>for him to lie on. He laid him at full length and cut out the sharp arrow 
<A NAME="659"></A>from his thigh; he washed the black blood from the wound with warm water; 
<A NAME="660"></A>he then crushed a bitter herb, rubbing it between his hands, and spread 
<A NAME="661"></A>it upon the wound; this was a virtuous herb which killed all pain; so the 
<A NAME="662"></A>wound presently dried and the blood left off flowing.
