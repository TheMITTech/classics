<A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A>And now, as Dawn rose from her couch beside Tithonus- harbinger of light 
<A NAME="11"></A>alike to mortals and immortals- the gods met in council and with them, 
<A NAME="12"></A>Jove the lord of thunder, who is their king. Thereon Minerva began to tell 
<A NAME="13"></A>them of the many sufferings of Ulysses, for she pitied him away there in 
<A NAME="14"></A>the house of the nymph Calypso.
<A NAME="15"></A><BR><BR>"Father Jove," said she, "and all you other gods that live in everlasting 
<A NAME="16"></A>bliss, I hope there may never be such a thing as a kind and well-disposed 
<A NAME="17"></A>ruler any more, nor one who will govern equitably. I hope they will be 
<A NAME="18"></A>all henceforth cruel and unjust, for there is not one of his subjects but 
<A NAME="19"></A>has forgotten Ulysses, who ruled them as though he were their father. There 
<A NAME="20"></A>he is, lying in great pain in an island where dwells the nymph Calypso, 
<A NAME="21"></A>who will not let him go; and he cannot get back to his own country, for 
<A NAME="22"></A>he can find neither ships nor sailors to take him over the sea. Furthermore, 
<A NAME="23"></A>wicked people are now trying to murder his only son Telemachus, who is 
<A NAME="24"></A>coming home from Pylos and Lacedaemon, where he has been to see if he can 
<A NAME="25"></A>get news of his father."
<A NAME="26"></A><BR><BR>"What, my dear, are you talking about?" replied her father, "did 
<A NAME="27"></A>you not send him there yourself, because you thought it would help Ulysses 
<A NAME="28"></A>to get home and punish the suitors? Besides, you are perfectly able to 
<A NAME="29"></A>protect Telemachus, and to see him safely home again, while the suitors 
<A NAME="30"></A>have to come hurry-skurrying back without having killed 
<A NAME="31"></A>him."
<A NAME="32"></A><BR><BR>When he had thus spoken, he said to his son Mercury, "Mercury, 
<A NAME="33"></A>you are our messenger, go therefore and tell Calypso we have decreed that 
<A NAME="34"></A>poor Ulysses is to return home. He is to be convoyed neither by gods nor 
<A NAME="35"></A>men, but after a perilous voyage of twenty days upon a raft he is to reach 
<A NAME="36"></A>fertile Scheria, the land of the Phaeacians, who are near of kin to the 
<A NAME="37"></A>gods, and will honour him as though he were one of ourselves. They will 
<A NAME="38"></A>send him in a ship to his own country, and will give him more bronze and 
<A NAME="39"></A>gold and raiment than he would have brought back from Troy, if he had had 
<A NAME="40"></A>had all his prize money and had got home without disaster. This is how 
<A NAME="41"></A>we have settled that he shall return to his country and his 
<A NAME="42"></A>friends."
<A NAME="43"></A><BR><BR>Thus he spoke, and Mercury, guide and guardian, slayer of Argus, 
<A NAME="44"></A>did as he was told. Forthwith he bound on his glittering golden sandals 
<A NAME="45"></A>with which he could fly like the wind over land and sea. He took the wand 
<A NAME="46"></A>with which he seals men's eyes in sleep or wakes them just as he pleases, 
<A NAME="47"></A>and flew holding it in his hand over Pieria; then he swooped down through 
<A NAME="48"></A>the firmament till he reached the level of the sea, whose waves he skimmed 
<A NAME="49"></A>like a cormorant that flies fishing every hole and corner of the ocean, 
<A NAME="50"></A>and drenching its thick plumage in the spray. He flew and flew over many 
<A NAME="51"></A>a weary wave, but when at last he got to the island which was his journey's 
<A NAME="52"></A>end, he left the sea and went on by land till he came to the cave where 
<A NAME="53"></A>the nymph Calypso lived.
<A NAME="54"></A><BR><BR>He found her at home. There was a large fire burning on the hearth, 
<A NAME="55"></A>and one could smell from far the fragrant reek of burning cedar and sandal 
<A NAME="56"></A>wood. As for herself, she was busy at her loom, shooting her golden shuttle 
<A NAME="57"></A>through the warp and singing beautifully. Round her cave there was a thick 
<A NAME="58"></A>wood of alder, poplar, and sweet smelling cypress trees, wherein all kinds 
<A NAME="59"></A>of great birds had built their nests- owls, hawks, and chattering sea-crows 
<A NAME="60"></A>that occupy their business in the waters. A vine loaded with grapes was 
<A NAME="61"></A>trained and grew luxuriantly about the mouth of the cave; there were also 
<A NAME="62"></A>four running rills of water in channels cut pretty close together, and 
<A NAME="63"></A>turned hither and thither so as to irrigate the beds of violets and luscious 
<A NAME="64"></A>herbage over which they flowed. Even a god could not help being charmed 
<A NAME="65"></A>with such a lovely spot, so Mercury stood still and looked at it; but when 
<A NAME="66"></A>he had admired it sufficiently he went inside the cave.
<A NAME="67"></A><BR><BR>Calypso knew him at once- for the gods all know each other, no 
<A NAME="68"></A>matter how far they live from one another- but Ulysses was not within; 
<A NAME="69"></A>he was on the sea-shore as usual, looking out upon the barren ocean with 
<A NAME="70"></A>tears in his eyes, groaning and breaking his heart for sorrow. Calypso 
<A NAME="71"></A>gave Mercury a seat and said: "Why have you come to see me, Mercury- honoured, 
<A NAME="72"></A>and ever welcome- for you do not visit me often? Say what you want; I will 
<A NAME="73"></A>do it for be you at once if I can, and if it can be done at all; but come 
<A NAME="74"></A>inside, and let me set refreshment before you.
<A NAME="75"></A><BR><BR>As she spoke she drew a table loaded with ambrosia beside him and 
<A NAME="76"></A>mixed him some red nectar, so Mercury ate and drank till he had had enough, 
<A NAME="77"></A>and then said:
<A NAME="78"></A><BR><BR>"We are speaking god and goddess to one another, one another, and 
<A NAME="79"></A>you ask me why I have come here, and I will tell you truly as you would 
<A NAME="80"></A>have me do. Jove sent me; it was no doing of mine; who could possibly want 
<A NAME="81"></A>to come all this way over the sea where there are no cities full of people 
<A NAME="82"></A>to offer me sacrifices or choice hecatombs? Nevertheless I had to come, 
<A NAME="83"></A>for none of us other gods can cross Jove, nor transgress his orders. He 
<A NAME="84"></A>says that you have here the most ill-starred of alf those who fought nine 
<A NAME="85"></A>years before the city of King Priam and sailed home in the tenth year after 
<A NAME="86"></A>having sacked it. On their way home they sinned against Minerva, who raised 
<A NAME="87"></A>both wind and waves against them, so that all his brave companions perished, 
<A NAME="88"></A>and he alone was carried hither by wind and tide. Jove says that you are 
<A NAME="89"></A>to let this by man go at once, for it is decreed that he shall not perish 
<A NAME="90"></A>here, far from his own people, but shall return to his house and country 
<A NAME="91"></A>and see his friends again."
<A NAME="92"></A><BR><BR>Calypso trembled with rage when she heard this, "You gods," she 
<A NAME="93"></A>exclaimed, to be ashamed of yourselves. You are always jealous and hate 
<A NAME="94"></A>seeing a goddess take a fancy to a mortal man, and live with him in open 
<A NAME="95"></A>matrimony. So when rosy-fingered Dawn made love to Orion, you precious 
<A NAME="96"></A>gods were all of you furious till Diana went and killed him in Ortygia. 
<A NAME="97"></A>So again when Ceres fell in love with Iasion, and yielded to him in a thrice 
<A NAME="98"></A>ploughed fallow field, Jove came to hear of it before so long and killed 
<A NAME="99"></A>Iasion with his thunder-bolts. And now you are angry with me too because 
<A NAME="100"></A>I have a man here. I found the poor creature sitting all alone astride 
<A NAME="101"></A>of a keel, for Jove had struck his ship with lightning and sunk it in mid 
<A NAME="102"></A>ocean, so that all his crew were drowned, while he himself was driven by 
<A NAME="103"></A>wind and waves on to my island. I got fond of him and cherished him, and 
<A NAME="104"></A>had set my heart on making him immortal, so that he should never grow old 
<A NAME="105"></A>all his days; still I cannot cross Jove, nor bring his counsels to nothing; 
<A NAME="106"></A>therefore, if he insists upon it, let the man go beyond the seas again; 
<A NAME="107"></A>but I cannot send him anywhere myself for I have neither ships nor men 
<A NAME="108"></A>who can take him. Nevertheless I will readily give him such advice, in 
<A NAME="109"></A>all good faith, as will be likely to bring him safely to his own 
<A NAME="110"></A>country."
<A NAME="111"></A><BR><BR>"Then send him away," said Mercury, "or Jove will be angry with 
<A NAME="112"></A>you and punish you"'
<A NAME="113"></A><BR><BR>On this he took his leave, and Calypso went out to look for Ulysses, 
<A NAME="114"></A>for she had heard Jove's message. She found him sitting upon the beach 
<A NAME="115"></A>with his eyes ever filled with tears, and dying of sheer home-sickness; 
<A NAME="116"></A>for he had got tired of Calypso, and though he was forced to sleep with 
<A NAME="117"></A>her in the cave by night, it was she, not he, that would have it so. As 
<A NAME="118"></A>for the day time, he spent it on the rocks and on the sea-shore, weeping, 
<A NAME="119"></A>crying aloud for his despair, and always looking out upon the sea. Calypso 
<A NAME="120"></A>then went close up to him said:
<A NAME="121"></A><BR><BR>"My poor fellow, you shall not stay here grieving and fretting 
<A NAME="122"></A>your life out any longer. I am going to send you away of my own free will; 
<A NAME="123"></A>so go, cut some beams of wood, and make yourself a large raft with an upper 
<A NAME="124"></A>deck that it may carry you safely over the sea. I will put bread, wine, 
<A NAME="125"></A>and water on board to save you from starving. I will also give you clothes, 
<A NAME="126"></A>and will send you a fair wind to take you home, if the gods in heaven so 
<A NAME="127"></A>will it- for they know more about these things, and can settle them better 
<A NAME="128"></A>than I can."
<A NAME="129"></A><BR><BR>Ulysses shuddered as he heard her. "Now goddess," he answered, 
<A NAME="130"></A>"there is something behind all this; you cannot be really meaning to help 
<A NAME="131"></A>me home when you bid me do such a dreadful thing as put to sea on a raft. 
<A NAME="132"></A>Not even a well-found ship with a fair wind could venture on such a distant 
<A NAME="133"></A>voyage: nothing that you can say or do shall mage me go on board a raft 
<A NAME="134"></A>unless you first solemnly swear that you mean me no 
<A NAME="135"></A>mischief."
<A NAME="136"></A><BR><BR>Calypso smiled at this and caressed him with her hand: "You know 
<A NAME="137"></A>a great deal," said she, "but you are quite wrong here. May heaven above 
<A NAME="138"></A>and earth below be my witnesses, with the waters of the river Styx- and 
<A NAME="139"></A>this is the most solemn oath which a blessed god can take- that I mean 
<A NAME="140"></A>you no sort of harm, and am only advising you to do exactly what I should 
<A NAME="141"></A>do myself in your place. I am dealing with you quite straightforwardly; 
<A NAME="142"></A>my heart is not made of iron, and I am very sorry for 
<A NAME="143"></A>you."
<A NAME="144"></A><BR><BR>When she had thus spoken she led the way rapidly before him, and 
<A NAME="145"></A>Ulysses followed in her steps; so the pair, goddess and man, went on and 
<A NAME="146"></A>on till they came to Calypso's cave, where Ulysses took the seat that Mercury 
<A NAME="147"></A>had just left. Calypso set meat and drink before him of the food that mortals 
<A NAME="148"></A>eat; but her maids brought ambrosia and nectar for herself, and they laid 
<A NAME="149"></A>their hands on the good things that were before them. When they had satisfied 
<A NAME="150"></A>themselves with meat and drink, Calypso spoke, saying:
<A NAME="151"></A><BR><BR>"Ulysses, noble son of Laertes, so you would start home to your 
<A NAME="152"></A>own land at once? Good luck go with you, but if you could only know how 
<A NAME="153"></A>much suffering is in store for you before you get back to your own country, 
<A NAME="154"></A>you would stay where you are, keep house along with me, and let me make 
<A NAME="155"></A>you immortal, no matter how anxious you may be to see this wife of yours, 
<A NAME="156"></A>of whom you are thinking all the time day after day; yet I flatter myself 
<A NAME="157"></A>that at am no whit less tall or well-looking than she is, for it is not 
<A NAME="158"></A>to be expected that a mortal woman should compare in beauty with an 
<A NAME="159"></A>immortal."
<A NAME="160"></A><BR><BR>"Goddess," replied Ulysses, "do not be angry with me about this. 
<A NAME="161"></A>I am quite aware that my wife Penelope is nothing like so tall or so beautiful 
<A NAME="162"></A>as yourself. She is only a woman, whereas you are an immortal. Nevertheless, 
<A NAME="163"></A>I want to get home, and can think of nothing else. If some god wrecks me 
<A NAME="164"></A>when I am on the sea, I will bear it and make the best of it. I have had 
<A NAME="165"></A>infinite trouble both by land and sea already, so let this go with the 
<A NAME="166"></A>rest."
<A NAME="167"></A><BR><BR>Presently the sun set and it became dark, whereon the pair retired 
<A NAME="168"></A>into the inner part of the cave and went to bed.
<A NAME="169"></A><BR><BR>When the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, Ulysses 
<A NAME="170"></A>put on his shirt and cloak, while the goddess wore a dress of a light gossamer 
<A NAME="171"></A>fabric, very fine and graceful, with a beautiful golden girdle about her 
<A NAME="172"></A>waist and a veil to cover her head. She at once set herself to think how 
<A NAME="173"></A>she could speed Ulysses on his way. So she gave him a great bronze axe 
<A NAME="174"></A>that suited his hands; it was sharpened on both sides, and had a beautiful 
<A NAME="175"></A>olive-wood handle fitted firmly on to it. She also gave him a sharp adze, 
<A NAME="176"></A>and then led the way to the far end of the island where the largest trees 
<A NAME="177"></A>grew- alder, poplar and pine, that reached the sky- very dry and well seasoned, 
<A NAME="178"></A>so as to sail light for him in the water. Then, when she had shown him 
<A NAME="179"></A>where the best trees grew, Calypso went home, leaving him to cut them, 
<A NAME="180"></A>which he soon finished doing. He cut down twenty trees in all and adzed 
<A NAME="181"></A>them smooth, squaring them by rule in good workmanlike fashion. Meanwhile 
<A NAME="182"></A>Calypso came back with some augers, so he bored holes with them and fitted 
<A NAME="183"></A>the timbers together with bolts and rivets. He made the raft as broad as 
<A NAME="184"></A>a skilled shipwright makes the beam of a large vessel, and he filed a deck 
<A NAME="185"></A>on top of the ribs, and ran a gunwale all round it. He also made a mast 
<A NAME="186"></A>with a yard arm, and a rudder to steer with. He fenced the raft all round 
<A NAME="187"></A>with wicker hurdles as a protection against the waves, and then he threw 
<A NAME="188"></A>on a quantity of wood. By and by Calypso brought him some linen to make 
<A NAME="189"></A>the sails, and he made these too, excellently, making them fast with braces 
<A NAME="190"></A>and sheets. Last of all, with the help of levers, he drew the raft down 
<A NAME="191"></A>into the water.
<A NAME="192"></A><BR><BR>In four days he had completed the whole work, and on the fifth 
<A NAME="193"></A>Calypso sent him from the island after washing him and giving him some 
<A NAME="194"></A>clean clothes. She gave him a goat skin full of black wine, and another 
<A NAME="195"></A>larger one of water; she also gave him a wallet full of provisions, and 
<A NAME="196"></A>found him in much good meat. Moreover, she made the wind fair and warm 
<A NAME="197"></A>for him, and gladly did Ulysses spread his sail before it, while he sat 
<A NAME="198"></A>and guided the raft skilfully by means of the rudder. He never closed his 
<A NAME="199"></A>eyes, but kept them fixed on the Pleiads, on late-setting Bootes, and on 
<A NAME="200"></A>the Bear- which men also call the wain, and which turns round and round 
<A NAME="201"></A>where it is, facing Orion, and alone never dipping into the stream of Oceanus- 
<A NAME="202"></A>for Calypso had told him to keep this to his left. Days seven and ten did 
<A NAME="203"></A>he sail over the sea, and on the eighteenth the dim outlines of the mountains 
<A NAME="204"></A>on the nearest part of the Phaeacian coast appeared, rising like a shield 
<A NAME="205"></A>on the horizon.
<A NAME="206"></A><BR><BR>But King Neptune, who was returning from the Ethiopians, caught 
<A NAME="207"></A>sight of Ulysses a long way off, from the mountains of the Solymi. He could 
<A NAME="208"></A>see him sailing upon the sea, and it made him very angry, so he wagged 
<A NAME="209"></A>his head and muttered to himself, saying, heavens, so the gods have been 
<A NAME="210"></A>changing their minds about Ulysses while I was away in Ethiopia, and now 
<A NAME="211"></A>he is close to the land of the Phaeacians, where it is decreed that he 
<A NAME="212"></A>shall escape from the calamities that have befallen him. Still, he shall 
<A NAME="213"></A>have plenty of hardship yet before he has done with 
<A NAME="214"></A>it."
<A NAME="215"></A><BR><BR>Thereon he gathered his clouds together, grasped his trident, stirred 
<A NAME="216"></A>it round in the sea, and roused the rage of every wind that blows till 
<A NAME="217"></A>earth, sea, and sky were hidden in cloud, and night sprang forth out of 
<A NAME="218"></A>the heavens. Winds from East, South, North, and West fell upon him all 
<A NAME="219"></A>at the same time, and a tremendous sea got up, so that Ulysses' heart began 
<A NAME="220"></A>to fail him. "Alas," he said to himself in his dismay, "what ever will 
<A NAME="221"></A>become of me? I am afraid Calypso was right when she said I should have 
<A NAME="222"></A>trouble by sea before I got back home. It is all coming true. How black 
<A NAME="223"></A>is Jove making heaven with his clouds, and what a sea the winds are raising 
<A NAME="224"></A>from every quarter at once. I am now safe to perish. Blest and thrice blest 
<A NAME="225"></A>were those Danaans who fell before Troy in the cause of the sons of Atreus. 
<A NAME="226"></A>Would that had been killed on the day when the Trojans were pressing me 
<A NAME="227"></A>so sorely about the dead body of Achilles, for then I should have had due 
<A NAME="228"></A>burial and the Achaeans would have honoured my name; but now it seems that 
<A NAME="229"></A>I shall come to a most pitiable end."
<A NAME="230"></A><BR><BR>As he spoke a sea broke over him with such terrific fury that the 
<A NAME="231"></A>raft reeled again, and he was carried overboard a long way off. He let 
<A NAME="232"></A>go the helm, and the force of the hurricane was so great that it broke 
<A NAME="233"></A>the mast half way up, and both sail and yard went over into the sea. For 
<A NAME="234"></A>a long time Ulysses was under water, and it was all he could do to rise 
<A NAME="235"></A>to the surface again, for the clothes Calypso had given him weighed him 
<A NAME="236"></A>down; but at last he got his head above water and spat out the bitter brine 
<A NAME="237"></A>that was running down his face in streams. In spite of all this, however, 
<A NAME="238"></A>he did not lose sight of his raft, but swam as fast as he could towards 
<A NAME="239"></A>it, got hold of it, and climbed on board again so as to escape drowning. 
<A NAME="240"></A>The sea took the raft and tossed it about as Autumn winds whirl thistledown 
<A NAME="241"></A>round and round upon a road. It was as though the South, North, East, and 
<A NAME="242"></A>West winds were all playing battledore and shuttlecock with it at 
<A NAME="243"></A>once.
<A NAME="244"></A><BR><BR>When he was in this plight, Ino daughter of Cadmus, also called 
<A NAME="245"></A>Leucothea, saw him. She had formerly been a mere mortal, but had been since 
<A NAME="246"></A>raised to the rank of a marine goddess. Seeing in what great distress Ulysses 
<A NAME="247"></A>now was, she had compassion upon him, and, rising like a sea-gull from 
<A NAME="248"></A>the waves, took her seat upon the raft.
<A NAME="249"></A><BR><BR>"My poor good man," said she, "why is Neptune so furiously angry 
<A NAME="250"></A>with you? He is giving you a great deal of trouble, but for all his bluster 
<A NAME="251"></A>he will not kill you. You seem to be a sensible person, do then as I bid 
<A NAME="252"></A>you; strip, leave your raft to drive before the wind, and swim to the Phaecian 
<A NAME="253"></A>coast where better luck awaits you. And here, take my veil and put it round 
<A NAME="254"></A>your chest; it is enchanted, and you can come to no harm so long as you 
<A NAME="255"></A>wear it. As soon as you touch land take it off, throw it back as far as 
<A NAME="256"></A>you can into the sea, and then go away again." With these words she took 
<A NAME="257"></A>off her veil and gave it him. Then she dived down again like a sea-gull 
<A NAME="258"></A>and vanished beneath the dark blue waters.
<A NAME="259"></A><BR><BR>But Ulysses did not know what to think. "Alas," he said to himself 
<A NAME="260"></A>in his dismay, "this is only some one or other of the gods who is luring 
<A NAME="261"></A>me to ruin by advising me to will quit my raft. At any rate I will not 
<A NAME="262"></A>do so at present, for the land where she said I should be quit of all troubles 
<A NAME="263"></A>seemed to be still a good way off. I know what I will do- I am sure it 
<A NAME="264"></A>will be best- no matter what happens I will stick to the raft as long as 
<A NAME="265"></A>her timbers hold together, but when the sea breaks her up I will swim for 
<A NAME="266"></A>it; I do not see how I can do any better than this."
<A NAME="267"></A><BR><BR>While he was thus in two minds, Neptune sent a terrible great wave 
<A NAME="268"></A>that seemed to rear itself above his head till it broke right over the 
<A NAME="269"></A>raft, which then went to pieces as though it were a heap of dry chaff tossed 
<A NAME="270"></A>about by a whirlwind. Ulysses got astride of one plank and rode upon it 
<A NAME="271"></A>as if he were on horseback; he then took off the clothes Calypso had given 
<A NAME="272"></A>him, bound Ino's veil under his arms, and plunged into the sea- meaning 
<A NAME="273"></A>to swim on shore. King Neptune watched him as he did so, and wagged his 
<A NAME="274"></A>head, muttering to himself and saying, "'There now, swim up and down as 
<A NAME="275"></A>you best can till you fall in with well-to-do people. I do not think you 
<A NAME="276"></A>will be able to say that I have let you off too lightly." On this he lashed 
<A NAME="277"></A>his horses and drove to Aegae where his palace is.
<A NAME="278"></A><BR><BR>But Minerva resolved to help Ulysses, so she bound the ways of 
<A NAME="279"></A>all the winds except one, and made them lie quite still; but she roused 
<A NAME="280"></A>a good stiff breeze from the North that should lay the waters till Ulysses 
<A NAME="281"></A>reached the land of the Phaeacians where he would be 
<A NAME="282"></A>safe.
<A NAME="283"></A><BR><BR>Thereon he floated about for two nights and two days in the water, 
<A NAME="284"></A>with a heavy swell on the sea and death staring him in the face; but when 
<A NAME="285"></A>the third day broke, the wind fell and there was a dead calm without so 
<A NAME="286"></A>much as a breath of air stirring. As he rose on the swell he looked eagerly 
<A NAME="287"></A>ahead, and could see land quite near. Then, as children rejoice when their 
<A NAME="288"></A>dear father begins to get better after having for a long time borne sore 
<A NAME="289"></A>affliction sent him by some angry spirit, but the gods deliver him from 
<A NAME="290"></A>evil, so was Ulysses thankful when he again saw land and trees, and swam 
<A NAME="291"></A>on with all his strength that he might once more set foot upon dry ground. 
<A NAME="292"></A>When, however, he got within earshot, he began to hear the surf thundering 
<A NAME="293"></A>up against the rocks, for the swell still broke against them with a terrific 
<A NAME="294"></A>roar. Everything was enveloped in spray; there were no harbours where a 
<A NAME="295"></A>ship might ride, nor shelter of any kind, but only headlands, low-lying 
<A NAME="296"></A>rocks, and mountain tops.
<A NAME="297"></A><BR><BR>Ulysses' heart now began to fail him, and he said despairingly 
<A NAME="298"></A>to himself, "Alas, Jove has let me see land after swimming so far that 
<A NAME="299"></A>I had given up all hope, but I can find no landing place, for the coast 
<A NAME="300"></A>is rocky and surf-beaten, the rocks are smooth and rise sheer from the 
<A NAME="301"></A>sea, with deep water close under them so that I cannot climb out for want 
<A NAME="302"></A>of foothold. I am afraid some great wave will lift me off my legs and dash 
<A NAME="303"></A>me against the rocks as I leave the water- which would give me a sorry 
<A NAME="304"></A>landing. If, on the other hand, I swim further in search of some shelving 
<A NAME="305"></A>beach or harbour, a hurricane may carry me out to sea again sorely against 
<A NAME="306"></A>my will, or heaven may send some great monster of the deep to attack me; 
<A NAME="307"></A>for Amphitrite breeds many such, and I know that Neptune is very angry 
<A NAME="308"></A>with me."
<A NAME="309"></A><BR><BR>While he was thus in two minds a wave caught him and took him with 
<A NAME="310"></A>such force against the rocks that he would have been smashed and torn to 
<A NAME="311"></A>pieces if Minerva had not shown him what to do. He caught hold of the rock 
<A NAME="312"></A>with both hands and clung to it groaning with pain till the wave retired, 
<A NAME="313"></A>so he was saved that time; but presently the wave came on again and carried 
<A NAME="314"></A>him back with it far into the sea-tearing his hands as the suckers of a 
<A NAME="315"></A>polypus are torn when some one plucks it from its bed, and the stones come 
<A NAME="316"></A>up along with it even so did the rocks tear the skin from his strong hands, 
<A NAME="317"></A>and then the wave drew him deep down under the water.
<A NAME="318"></A><BR><BR>Here poor Ulysses would have certainly perished even in spite of 
<A NAME="319"></A>his own destiny, if Minerva had not helped him to keep his wits about him. 
<A NAME="320"></A>He swam seaward again, beyond reach of the surf that was beating against 
<A NAME="321"></A>the land, and at the same time he kept looking towards the shore to see 
<A NAME="322"></A>if he could find some haven, or a spit that should take the waves aslant. 
<A NAME="323"></A>By and by, as he swam on, he came to the mouth of a river, and here he 
<A NAME="324"></A>thought would be the best place, for there were no rocks, and it afforded 
<A NAME="325"></A>shelter from the wind. He felt that there was a current, so he prayed inwardly 
<A NAME="326"></A>and said:
<A NAME="327"></A><BR><BR>"Hear me, O King, whoever you may be, and save me from the anger 
<A NAME="328"></A>of the sea-god Neptune, for I approach you prayerfully. Any one who has 
<A NAME="329"></A>lost his way has at all times a claim even upon the gods, wherefore in 
<A NAME="330"></A>my distress I draw near to your stream, and cling to the knees of your 
<A NAME="331"></A>riverhood. Have mercy upon me, O king, for I declare myself your 
<A NAME="332"></A>suppliant."
<A NAME="333"></A><BR><BR>Then the god stayed his stream and stilled the waves, making all 
<A NAME="334"></A>calm before him, and bringing him safely into the mouth of the river. Here 
<A NAME="335"></A>at last Ulysses' knees and strong hands failed him, for the sea had completely 
<A NAME="336"></A>broken him. His body was all swollen, and his mouth and nostrils ran down 
<A NAME="337"></A>like a river with sea-water, so that he could neither breathe nor speak, 
<A NAME="338"></A>and lay swooning from sheer exhaustion; presently, when he had got his 
<A NAME="339"></A>breath and came to himself again, he took off the scarf that Ino had given 
<A NAME="340"></A>him and threw it back into the salt stream of the river, whereon Ino received 
<A NAME="341"></A>it into her hands from the wave that bore it towards her. Then he left 
<A NAME="342"></A>the river, laid himself down among the rushes, and kissed the bounteous 
<A NAME="343"></A>earth.
<A NAME="344"></A><BR><BR>"Alas," he cried to himself in his dismay, "what ever will become 
<A NAME="345"></A>of me, and how is it all to end? If I stay here upon the river bed through 
<A NAME="346"></A>the long watches of the night, I am so exhausted that the bitter cold and 
<A NAME="347"></A>damp may make an end of me- for towards sunrise there will be a keen wind 
<A NAME="348"></A>blowing from off the river. If, on the other hand, I climb the hill side, 
<A NAME="349"></A>find shelter in the woods, and sleep in some thicket, I may escape the 
<A NAME="350"></A>cold and have a good night's rest, but some savage beast may take advantage 
<A NAME="351"></A>of me and devour me."
<A NAME="352"></A><BR><BR>In the end he deemed it best to take to the woods, and he found 
<A NAME="353"></A>one upon some high ground not far from the water. There he crept beneath 
<A NAME="354"></A>two shoots of olive that grew from a single stock- the one an ungrafted 
<A NAME="355"></A>sucker, while the other had been grafted. No wind, however squally, could 
<A NAME="356"></A>break through the cover they afforded, nor could the sun's rays pierce 
<A NAME="357"></A>them, nor the rain get through them, so closely did they grow into one 
<A NAME="358"></A>another. Ulysses crept under these and began to make himself a bed to lie 
<A NAME="359"></A>on, for there was a great litter of dead leaves lying about- enough to 
<A NAME="360"></A>make a covering for two or three men even in hard winter weather. He was 
<A NAME="361"></A>glad enough to see this, so he laid himself down and heaped the leaves 
<A NAME="362"></A>all round him. Then, as one who lives alone in the country, far from any 
<A NAME="363"></A>neighbor, hides a brand as fire-seed in the ashes to save himself from 
<A NAME="364"></A>having to get a light elsewhere, even so did Ulysses cover himself up with 
<A NAME="365"></A>leaves; and Minerva shed a sweet sleep upon his eyes, closed his eyelids, 
<A NAME="366"></A>and made him lose all memories of his sorrows.
