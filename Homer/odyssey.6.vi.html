<A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A>So here Ulysses slept, overcome by sleep and toil; but Minerva went off 
<A NAME="11"></A>to the country and city of the Phaecians- a people who used to live in 
<A NAME="12"></A>the fair town of Hypereia, near the lawless Cyclopes. Now the Cyclopes 
<A NAME="13"></A>were stronger than they and plundered them, so their king Nausithous moved 
<A NAME="14"></A>them thence and settled them in Scheria, far from all other people. He 
<A NAME="15"></A>surrounded the city with a wall, built houses and temples, and divided 
<A NAME="16"></A>the lands among his people; but he was dead and gone to the house of Hades, 
<A NAME="17"></A>and King Alcinous, whose counsels were inspired of heaven, was now reigning. 
<A NAME="18"></A>To his house, then, did Minerva hie in furtherance of the return of 
<A NAME="19"></A>Ulysses.
<A NAME="20"></A><BR><BR>She went straight to the beautifully decorated bedroom in which 
<A NAME="21"></A>there slept a girl who was as lovely as a goddess, Nausicaa, daughter to 
<A NAME="22"></A>King Alcinous. Two maid servants were sleeping near her, both very pretty, 
<A NAME="23"></A>one on either side of the doorway, which was closed with well-made folding 
<A NAME="24"></A>doors. Minerva took the form of the famous sea captain Dymas's daughter, 
<A NAME="25"></A>who was a bosom friend of Nausicaa and just her own age; then, coming up 
<A NAME="26"></A>to the girl's bedside like a breath of wind, she hovered over her head 
<A NAME="27"></A>and said:
<A NAME="28"></A><BR><BR>"Nausicaa, what can your mother have been about, to have such a 
<A NAME="29"></A>lazy daughter? Here are your clothes all lying in disorder, yet you are 
<A NAME="30"></A>going to be married almost immediately, and should not only be well dressed 
<A NAME="31"></A>yourself, but should find good clothes for those who attend you. This is 
<A NAME="32"></A>the way to get yourself a good name, and to make your father and mother 
<A NAME="33"></A>proud of you. Suppose, then, that we make tomorrow a washing day, and start 
<A NAME="34"></A>at daybreak. I will come and help you so that you may have everything ready 
<A NAME="35"></A>as soon as possible, for all the best young men among your own people are 
<A NAME="36"></A>courting you, and you are not going to remain a maid much longer. Ask your 
<A NAME="37"></A>father, therefore, to have a waggon and mules ready for us at daybreak, 
<A NAME="38"></A>to take the rugs, robes, and girdles; and you can ride, too, which will 
<A NAME="39"></A>be much pleasanter for you than walking, for the washing-cisterns are some 
<A NAME="40"></A>way from the town."
<A NAME="41"></A><BR><BR>When she had said this Minerva went away to Olympus, which they 
<A NAME="42"></A>say is the everlasting home of the gods. Here no wind beats roughly, and 
<A NAME="43"></A>neither rain nor snow can fall; but it abides in everlasting sunshine and 
<A NAME="44"></A>in a great peacefulness of light, wherein the blessed gods are illumined 
<A NAME="45"></A>for ever and ever. This was the place to which the goddess went when she 
<A NAME="46"></A>had given instructions to the girl.
<A NAME="47"></A><BR><BR>By and by morning came and woke Nausicaa, who began wondering about 
<A NAME="48"></A>her dream; she therefore went to the other end of the house to tell her 
<A NAME="49"></A>father and mother all about it, and found them in their own room. Her mother 
<A NAME="50"></A>was sitting by the fireside spinning her purple yarn with her maids around 
<A NAME="51"></A>her, and she happened to catch her father just as he was going out to attend 
<A NAME="52"></A>a meeting of the town council, which the Phaeacian aldermen had convened. 
<A NAME="53"></A>She stopped him and said:
<A NAME="54"></A><BR><BR>"Papa dear, could you manage to let me have a good big waggon? 
<A NAME="55"></A>I want to take all our dirty clothes to the river and wash them. You are 
<A NAME="56"></A>the chief man here, so it is only right that you should have a clean shirt 
<A NAME="57"></A>when you attend meetings of the council. Moreover, you have five sons at 
<A NAME="58"></A>home, two of them married, while the other three are good-looking bachelors; 
<A NAME="59"></A>you know they always like to have clean linen when they go to a dance, 
<A NAME="60"></A>and I have been thinking about all this."
<A NAME="61"></A><BR><BR>She did not say a word about her own wedding, for she did not like 
<A NAME="62"></A>to, but her father knew and said, "You shall have the mules, my love, and 
<A NAME="63"></A>whatever else you have a mind for. Be off with you, and the men shall get 
<A NAME="64"></A>you a good strong waggon with a body to it that will hold all your 
<A NAME="65"></A>clothes."
<A NAME="66"></A><BR><BR>On this he gave his orders to the servants, who got the waggon 
<A NAME="67"></A>out, harnessed the mules, and put them to, while the girl brought the clothes 
<A NAME="68"></A>down from the linen room and placed them on the waggon. Her mother prepared 
<A NAME="69"></A>her a basket of provisions with all sorts of good things, and a goat skin 
<A NAME="70"></A>full of wine; the girl now got into the waggon, and her mother gave her 
<A NAME="71"></A>also a golden cruse of oil, that she and her women might anoint themselves. 
<A NAME="72"></A>Then she took the whip and reins and lashed the mules on, whereon they 
<A NAME="73"></A>set off, and their hoofs clattered on the road. They pulled without flagging, 
<A NAME="74"></A>and carried not only Nausicaa and her wash of clothes, but the maids also 
<A NAME="75"></A>who were with her.
<A NAME="76"></A><BR><BR>When they reached the water side they went to the washing-cisterns, 
<A NAME="77"></A>through which there ran at all times enough pure water to wash any quantity 
<A NAME="78"></A>of linen, no matter how dirty. Here they unharnessed the mules and turned 
<A NAME="79"></A>them out to feed on the sweet juicy herbage that grew by the water side. 
<A NAME="80"></A>They took the clothes out of the waggon, put them in the water, and vied 
<A NAME="81"></A>with one another in treading them in the pits to get the dirt out. After 
<A NAME="82"></A>they had washed them and got them quite clean, they laid them out by the 
<A NAME="83"></A>sea side, where the waves had raised a high beach of shingle, and set about 
<A NAME="84"></A>washing themselves and anointing themselves with olive oil. Then they got 
<A NAME="85"></A>their dinner by the side of the stream, and waited for the sun to finish 
<A NAME="86"></A>drying the clothes. When they had done dinner they threw off the veils 
<A NAME="87"></A>that covered their heads and began to play at ball, while Nausicaa sang 
<A NAME="88"></A>for them. As the huntress Diana goes forth upon the mountains of Taygetus 
<A NAME="89"></A>or Erymanthus to hunt wild boars or deer, and the wood-nymphs, daughters 
<A NAME="90"></A>of Aegis-bearing Jove, take their sport along with her (then is Leto proud 
<A NAME="91"></A>at seeing her daughter stand a full head taller than the others, and eclipse 
<A NAME="92"></A>the loveliest amid a whole bevy of beauties), even so did the girl outshine 
<A NAME="93"></A>her handmaids.
<A NAME="94"></A><BR><BR>When it was time for them to start home, and they were folding 
<A NAME="95"></A>the clothes and putting them into the waggon, Minerva began to consider 
<A NAME="96"></A>how Ulysses should wake up and see the handsome girl who was to conduct 
<A NAME="97"></A>him to the city of the Phaeacians. The girl, therefore, threw a ball at 
<A NAME="98"></A>one of the maids, which missed her and fell into deep water. On this they 
<A NAME="99"></A>all shouted, and the noise they made woke Ulysses, who sat up in his bed 
<A NAME="100"></A>of leaves and began to wonder what it might all be.
<A NAME="101"></A><BR><BR>"Alas," said he to himself, "what kind of people have I come amongst? 
<A NAME="102"></A>Are they cruel, savage, and uncivilized, or hospitable and humane? I seem 
<A NAME="103"></A>to hear the voices of young women, and they sound like those of the nymphs 
<A NAME="104"></A>that haunt mountain tops, or springs of rivers and meadows of green grass. 
<A NAME="105"></A>At any rate I am among a race of men and women. Let me try if I cannot 
<A NAME="106"></A>manage to get a look at them."
<A NAME="107"></A><BR><BR>As he said this he crept from under his bush, and broke off a bough 
<A NAME="108"></A>covered with thick leaves to hide his nakedness. He looked like some lion 
<A NAME="109"></A>of the wilderness that stalks about exulting in his strength and defying 
<A NAME="110"></A>both wind and rain; his eyes glare as he prowls in quest of oxen, sheep, 
<A NAME="111"></A>or deer, for he is famished, and will dare break even into a well-fenced 
<A NAME="112"></A>homestead, trying to get at the sheep- even such did Ulysses seem to the 
<A NAME="113"></A>young women, as he drew near to them all naked as he was, for he was in 
<A NAME="114"></A>great want. On seeing one so unkempt and so begrimed with salt water, the 
<A NAME="115"></A>others scampered off along the spits that jutted out into the sea, but 
<A NAME="116"></A>the daughter of Alcinous stood firm, for Minerva put courage into her heart 
<A NAME="117"></A>and took away all fear from her. She stood right in front of Ulysses, and 
<A NAME="118"></A>he doubted whether he should go up to her, throw himself at her feet, and 
<A NAME="119"></A>embrace her knees as a suppliant, or stay where he was and entreat her 
<A NAME="120"></A>to give him some clothes and show him the way to the town. In the end he 
<A NAME="121"></A>deemed it best to entreat her from a distance in case the girl should take 
<A NAME="122"></A>offence at his coming near enough to clasp her knees, so he addressed her 
<A NAME="123"></A>in honeyed and persuasive language.
<A NAME="124"></A><BR><BR>"O queen," he said, "I implore your aid- but tell me, are you a 
<A NAME="125"></A>goddess or are you a mortal woman? If you are a goddess and dwell in heaven, 
<A NAME="126"></A>I can only conjecture that you are Jove's daughter Diana, for your face 
<A NAME="127"></A>and figure resemble none but hers; if on the other hand you are a mortal 
<A NAME="128"></A>and live on earth, thrice happy are your father and mother- thrice happy, 
<A NAME="129"></A>too, are your brothers and sisters; how proud and delighted they must feel 
<A NAME="130"></A>when they see so fair a scion as yourself going out to a dance; most happy, 
<A NAME="131"></A>however, of all will he be whose wedding gifts have been the richest, and 
<A NAME="132"></A>who takes you to his own home. I never yet saw any one so beautiful, neither 
<A NAME="133"></A>man nor woman, and am lost in admiration as I behold you. I can only compare 
<A NAME="134"></A>you to a young palm tree which I saw when I was at Delos growing near the 
<A NAME="135"></A>altar of Apollo- for I was there, too, with much people after me, when 
<A NAME="136"></A>I was on that journey which has been the source of all my troubles. Never 
<A NAME="137"></A>yet did such a young plant shoot out of the ground as that was, and I admired 
<A NAME="138"></A>and wondered at it exactly as I now admire and wonder at yourself. I dare 
<A NAME="139"></A>not clasp your knees, but I am in great distress; yesterday made the twentieth 
<A NAME="140"></A>day that I had been tossing about upon the sea. The winds and waves have 
<A NAME="141"></A>taken me all the way from the Ogygian island, and now fate has flung me 
<A NAME="142"></A>upon this coast that I may endure still further suffering; for I do not 
<A NAME="143"></A>think that I have yet come to the end of it, but rather that heaven has 
<A NAME="144"></A>still much evil in store for me.
<A NAME="145"></A><BR><BR>"And now, O queen, have pity upon me, for you are the first person 
<A NAME="146"></A>I have met, and I know no one else in this country. Show me the way to 
<A NAME="147"></A>your town, and let me have anything that you may have brought hither to 
<A NAME="148"></A>wrap your clothes in. May heaven grant you in all things your heart's desire- 
<A NAME="149"></A>husband, house, and a happy, peaceful home; for there is nothing better 
<A NAME="150"></A>in this world than that man and wife should be of one mind in a house. 
<A NAME="151"></A>It discomfits their enemies, makes the hearts of their friends glad, and 
<A NAME="152"></A>they themselves know more about it than any one."
<A NAME="153"></A><BR><BR>To this Nausicaa answered, "Stranger, you appear to be a sensible, 
<A NAME="154"></A>well-disposed person. There is no accounting for luck; Jove gives prosperity 
<A NAME="155"></A>to rich and poor just as he chooses, so you must take what he has seen 
<A NAME="156"></A>fit to send you, and make the best of it. Now, however, that you have come 
<A NAME="157"></A>to this our country, you shall not want for clothes nor for anything else 
<A NAME="158"></A>that a foreigner in distress may reasonably look for. I will show you the 
<A NAME="159"></A>way to the town, and will tell you the name of our people; we are called 
<A NAME="160"></A>Phaeacians, and I am daughter to Alcinous, in whom the whole power of the 
<A NAME="161"></A>state is vested."
<A NAME="162"></A><BR><BR>Then she called her maids and said, "Stay where you are, you girls. 
<A NAME="163"></A>Can you not see a man without running away from him? Do you take him for 
<A NAME="164"></A>a robber or a murderer? Neither he nor any one else can come here to do 
<A NAME="165"></A>us Phaeacians any harm, for we are dear to the gods, and live apart on 
<A NAME="166"></A>a land's end that juts into the sounding sea, and have nothing to do with 
<A NAME="167"></A>any other people. This is only some poor man who has lost his way, and 
<A NAME="168"></A>we must be kind to him, for strangers and foreigners in distress are under 
<A NAME="169"></A>Jove's protection, and will take what they can get and be thankful; so, 
<A NAME="170"></A>girls, give the poor fellow something to eat and drink, and wash him in 
<A NAME="171"></A>the stream at some place that is sheltered from the 
<A NAME="172"></A>wind."
<A NAME="173"></A><BR><BR>On this the maids left off running away and began calling one another 
<A NAME="174"></A>back. They made Ulysses sit down in the shelter as Nausicaa had told them, 
<A NAME="175"></A>and brought him a shirt and cloak. They also brought him the little golden 
<A NAME="176"></A>cruse of oil, and told him to go wash in the stream. But Ulysses said, 
<A NAME="177"></A>"Young women, please to stand a little on one side that I may wash the 
<A NAME="178"></A>brine from my shoulders and anoint myself with oil, for it is long enough 
<A NAME="179"></A>since my skin has had a drop of oil upon it. I cannot wash as long as you 
<A NAME="180"></A>all keep standing there. I am ashamed to strip before a number of good-looking 
<A NAME="181"></A>young women."
<A NAME="182"></A><BR><BR>Then they stood on one side and went to tell the girl, while Ulysses 
<A NAME="183"></A>washed himself in the stream and scrubbed the brine from his back and from 
<A NAME="184"></A>his broad shoulders. When he had thoroughly washed himself, and had got 
<A NAME="185"></A>the brine out of his hair, he anointed himself with oil, and put on the 
<A NAME="186"></A>clothes which the girl had given him; Minerva then made him look taller 
<A NAME="187"></A>and stronger than before, she also made the hair grow thick on the top 
<A NAME="188"></A>of his head, and flow down in curls like hyacinth blossoms; she glorified 
<A NAME="189"></A>him about the head and shoulders as a skilful workman who has studied art 
<A NAME="190"></A>of all kinds under Vulcan and Minerva enriches a piece of silver plate 
<A NAME="191"></A>by gilding it- and his work is full of beauty. Then he went and sat down 
<A NAME="192"></A>a little way off upon the beach, looking quite young and handsome, and 
<A NAME="193"></A>the girl gazed on him with admiration; then she said to her 
<A NAME="194"></A>maids:
<A NAME="195"></A><BR><BR>"Hush, my dears, for I want to say something. I believe the gods 
<A NAME="196"></A>who live in heaven have sent this man to the Phaeacians. When I first saw 
<A NAME="197"></A>him I thought him plain, but now his appearance is like that of the gods 
<A NAME="198"></A>who dwell in heaven. I should like my future husband to be just such another 
<A NAME="199"></A>as he is, if he would only stay here and not want to go away. However, 
<A NAME="200"></A>give him something to eat and drink."
<A NAME="201"></A><BR><BR>They did as they were told, and set food before Ulysses, who ate 
<A NAME="202"></A>and drank ravenously, for it was long since he had had food of any kind. 
<A NAME="203"></A>Meanwhile, Nausicaa bethought her of another matter. She got the linen 
<A NAME="204"></A>folded and placed in the waggon, she then yoked the mules, and, as she 
<A NAME="205"></A>took her seat, she called Ulysses:
<A NAME="206"></A><BR><BR>"Stranger," said she, "rise and let us be going back to the town; 
<A NAME="207"></A>I will introduce you at the house of my excellent father, where I can tell 
<A NAME="208"></A>you that you will meet all the best people among the Phaecians. But be 
<A NAME="209"></A>sure and do as I bid you, for you seem to be a sensible person. As long 
<A NAME="210"></A>as we are going past the fields- and farm lands, follow briskly behind 
<A NAME="211"></A>the waggon along with the maids and I will lead the way myself. Presently, 
<A NAME="212"></A>however, we shall come to the town, where you will find a high wall running 
<A NAME="213"></A>all round it, and a good harbour on either side with a narrow entrance 
<A NAME="214"></A>into the city, and the ships will be drawn up by the road side, for every 
<A NAME="215"></A>one has a place where his own ship can lie. You will see the market place 
<A NAME="216"></A>with a temple of Neptune in the middle of it, and paved with large stones 
<A NAME="217"></A>bedded in the earth. Here people deal in ship's gear of all kinds, such 
<A NAME="218"></A>as cables and sails, and here, too, are the places where oars are made, 
<A NAME="219"></A>for the Phaeacians are not a nation of archers; they know nothing about 
<A NAME="220"></A>bows and arrows, but are a sea-faring folk, and pride themselves on their 
<A NAME="221"></A>masts, oars, and ships, with which they travel far over the 
<A NAME="222"></A>sea.
<A NAME="223"></A><BR><BR>"I am afraid of the gossip and scandal that may be set on foot 
<A NAME="224"></A>against me later on; for the people here are very ill-natured, and some 
<A NAME="225"></A>low fellow, if he met us, might say, 'Who is this fine-looking stranger 
<A NAME="226"></A>that is going about with Nausicaa? Where did she End him? I suppose she 
<A NAME="227"></A>is going to marry him. Perhaps he is a vagabond sailor whom she has taken 
<A NAME="228"></A>from some foreign vessel, for we have no neighbours; or some god has at 
<A NAME="229"></A>last come down from heaven in answer to her prayers, and she is going to 
<A NAME="230"></A>live with him all the rest of her life. It would be a good thing if she 
<A NAME="231"></A>would take herself of I for sh and find a husband somewhere else, for she 
<A NAME="232"></A>will not look at one of the many excellent young Phaeacians who are in 
<A NAME="233"></A>with her.' This is the kind of disparaging remark that would be made about 
<A NAME="234"></A>me, and I could not complain, for I should myself be scandalized at seeing 
<A NAME="235"></A>any other girl do the like, and go about with men in spite of everybody, 
<A NAME="236"></A>while her father and mother were still alive, and without having been married 
<A NAME="237"></A>in the face of all the world.
<A NAME="238"></A><BR><BR>"If, therefore, you want my father to give you an escort and to 
<A NAME="239"></A>help you home, do as I bid you; you will see a beautiful grove of poplars 
<A NAME="240"></A>by the road side dedicated to Minerva; it has a well in it and a meadow 
<A NAME="241"></A>all round it. Here my father has a field of rich garden ground, about as 
<A NAME="242"></A>far from the town as a man' voice will carry. Sit down there and wait for 
<A NAME="243"></A>a while till the rest of us can get into the town and reach my father's 
<A NAME="244"></A>house. Then, when you think we must have done this, come into the town 
<A NAME="245"></A>and ask the way to the house of my father Alcinous. You will have no difficulty 
<A NAME="246"></A>in finding it; any child will point it out to you, for no one else in the 
<A NAME="247"></A>whole town has anything like such a fine house as he has. When you have 
<A NAME="248"></A>got past the gates and through the outer court, go right across the inner 
<A NAME="249"></A>court till you come to my mother. You will find her sitting by the fire 
<A NAME="250"></A>and spinning her purple wool by firelight. It is a fine sight to see her 
<A NAME="251"></A>as she leans back against one of the bearing-posts with her maids all ranged 
<A NAME="252"></A>behind her. Close to her seat stands that of my father, on which he sits 
<A NAME="253"></A>and topes like an immortal god. Never mind him, but go up to my mother, 
<A NAME="254"></A>and lay your hands upon her knees if you would get home quickly. If you 
<A NAME="255"></A>can gain her over, you may hope to see your own country again, no matter 
<A NAME="256"></A>how distant it may be."
<A NAME="257"></A><BR><BR>So saying she lashed the mules with her whip and they left the 
<A NAME="258"></A>river. The mules drew well and their hoofs went up and down upon the road. 
<A NAME="259"></A>She was careful not to go too fast for Ulysses and the maids who were following 
<A NAME="260"></A>on foot along with the waggon, so she plied her whip with judgement. As 
<A NAME="261"></A>the sun was going down they came to the sacred grove of Minerva, and there 
<A NAME="262"></A>Ulysses sat down and prayed to the mighty daughter of 
<A NAME="263"></A>Jove.
<A NAME="264"></A><BR><BR>"Hear me," he cried, "daughter of Aegis-bearing Jove, unweariable, 
<A NAME="265"></A>hear me now, for you gave no heed to my prayers when Neptune was wrecking 
<A NAME="266"></A>me. Now, therefore, have pity upon me and grant that I may find friends 
<A NAME="267"></A>and be hospitably received by the Phaecians."
<A NAME="268"></A><BR><BR>Thus did he pray, and Minerva heard his prayer, but she would not 
<A NAME="269"></A>show herself to him openly, for she was afraid of her uncle Neptune, who 
<A NAME="270"></A>was still furious in his endeavors to prevent Ulysses from getting 
<A NAME="271"></A>home.
