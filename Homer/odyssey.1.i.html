<A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A>Tell me, O muse, of that ingenious hero who travelled far and wide after 
<A NAME="11"></A>he had sacked the famous town of Troy. Many cities did he visit, and many 
<A NAME="12"></A>were the nations with whose manners and customs he was acquainted; moreover 
<A NAME="13"></A>he suffered much by sea while trying to save his own life and bring his 
<A NAME="14"></A>men safely home; but do what he might he could not save his men, for they 
<A NAME="15"></A>perished through their own sheer folly in eating the cattle of the Sun-god 
<A NAME="16"></A>Hyperion; so the god prevented them from ever reaching home. Tell me, too, 
<A NAME="17"></A>about all these things, O daughter of Jove, from whatsoever source you 
<A NAME="18"></A>may know them.
<A NAME="19"></A><BR><BR>So now all who escaped death in battle or by shipwreck had got 
<A NAME="20"></A>safely home except Ulysses, and he, though he was longing to return to 
<A NAME="21"></A>his wife and country, was detained by the goddess Calypso, who had got 
<A NAME="22"></A>him into a large cave and wanted to marry him. But as years went by, there 
<A NAME="23"></A>came a time when the gods settled that he should go back to Ithaca; even 
<A NAME="24"></A>then, however, when he was among his own people, his troubles were not 
<A NAME="25"></A>yet over; nevertheless all the gods had now begun to pity him except Neptune, 
<A NAME="26"></A>who still persecuted him without ceasing and would not let him get 
<A NAME="27"></A>home.
<A NAME="28"></A><BR><BR>Now Neptune had gone off to the Ethiopians, who are at the world's 
<A NAME="29"></A>end, and lie in two halves, the one looking West and the other East. He 
<A NAME="30"></A>had gone there to accept a hecatomb of sheep and oxen, and was enjoying 
<A NAME="31"></A>himself at his festival; but the other gods met in the house of Olympian 
<A NAME="32"></A>Jove, and the sire of gods and men spoke first. At that moment he was thinking 
<A NAME="33"></A>of Aegisthus, who had been killed by Agamemnon's son Orestes; so he said 
<A NAME="34"></A>to the other gods:
<A NAME="35"></A><BR><BR>"See now, how men lay blame upon us gods for what is after all 
<A NAME="36"></A>nothing but their own folly. Look at Aegisthus; he must needs make love 
<A NAME="37"></A>to Agamemnon's wife unrighteously and then kill Agamemnon, though he knew 
<A NAME="38"></A>it would be the death of him; for I sent Mercury to warn him not to do 
<A NAME="39"></A>either of these things, inasmuch as Orestes would be sure to take his revenge 
<A NAME="40"></A>when he grew up and wanted to return home. Mercury told him this in all 
<A NAME="41"></A>good will but he would not listen, and now he has paid for everything in 
<A NAME="42"></A>full."
<A NAME="43"></A><BR><BR>Then Minerva said, "Father, son of Saturn, King of kings, it served 
<A NAME="44"></A>Aegisthus right, and so it would any one else who does as he did; but Aegisthus 
<A NAME="45"></A>is neither here nor there; it is for Ulysses that my heart bleeds, when 
<A NAME="46"></A>I think of his sufferings in that lonely sea-girt island, far away, poor 
<A NAME="47"></A>man, from all his friends. It is an island covered with forest, in the 
<A NAME="48"></A>very middle of the sea, and a goddess lives there, daughter of the magician 
<A NAME="49"></A>Atlas, who looks after the bottom of the ocean, and carries the great columns 
<A NAME="50"></A>that keep heaven and earth asunder. This daughter of Atlas has got hold 
<A NAME="51"></A>of poor unhappy Ulysses, and keeps trying by every kind of blandishment 
<A NAME="52"></A>to make him forget his home, so that he is tired of life, and thinks of 
<A NAME="53"></A>nothing but how he may once more see the smoke of his own chimneys. You, 
<A NAME="54"></A>sir, take no heed of this, and yet when Ulysses was before Troy did he 
<A NAME="55"></A>not propitiate you with many a burnt sacrifice? Why then should you keep 
<A NAME="56"></A>on being so angry with him?"
<A NAME="57"></A><BR><BR>And Jove said, "My child, what are you talking about? How can I 
<A NAME="58"></A>forget Ulysses than whom there is no more capable man on earth, nor more 
<A NAME="59"></A>liberal in his offerings to the immortal gods that live in heaven? Bear 
<A NAME="60"></A>in mind, however, that Neptune is still furious with Ulysses for having 
<A NAME="61"></A>blinded an eye of Polyphemus king of the Cyclopes. Polyphemus is son to 
<A NAME="62"></A>Neptune by the nymph Thoosa, daughter to the sea-king Phorcys; therefore 
<A NAME="63"></A>though he will not kill Ulysses outright, he torments him by preventing 
<A NAME="64"></A>him from getting home. Still, let us lay our heads together and see how 
<A NAME="65"></A>we can help him to return; Neptune will then be pacified, for if we are 
<A NAME="66"></A>all of a mind he can hardly stand out against us."
<A NAME="67"></A><BR><BR>And Minerva said, "Father, son of Saturn, King of kings, if, then, 
<A NAME="68"></A>the gods now mean that Ulysses should get home, we should first send Mercury 
<A NAME="69"></A>to the Ogygian island to tell Calypso that we have made up our minds and 
<A NAME="70"></A>that he is to return. In the meantime I will go to Ithaca, to put heart 
<A NAME="71"></A>into Ulysses' son Telemachus; I will embolden him to call the Achaeans 
<A NAME="72"></A>in assembly, and speak out to the suitors of his mother Penelope, who persist 
<A NAME="73"></A>in eating up any number of his sheep and oxen; I will also conduct him 
<A NAME="74"></A>to Sparta and to Pylos, to see if he can hear anything about the return 
<A NAME="75"></A>of his dear father- for this will make people speak well of 
<A NAME="76"></A>him."
<A NAME="77"></A><BR><BR>So saying she bound on her glittering golden sandals, imperishable, 
<A NAME="78"></A>with which she can fly like the wind over land or sea; she grasped the 
<A NAME="79"></A>redoubtable bronze-shod spear, so stout and sturdy and strong, wherewith 
<A NAME="80"></A>she quells the ranks of heroes who have displeased her, and down she darted 
<A NAME="81"></A>from the topmost summits of Olympus, whereon forthwith she was in Ithaca, 
<A NAME="82"></A>at the gateway of Ulysses' house, disguised as a visitor, Mentes, chief 
<A NAME="83"></A>of the Taphians, and she held a bronze spear in her hand. There she found 
<A NAME="84"></A>the lordly suitors seated on hides of the oxen which they had killed and 
<A NAME="85"></A>eaten, and playing draughts in front of the house. Men-servants and pages 
<A NAME="86"></A>were bustling about to wait upon them, some mixing wine with water in the 
<A NAME="87"></A>mixing-bowls, some cleaning down the tables with wet sponges and laying 
<A NAME="88"></A>them out again, and some cutting up great quantities of 
<A NAME="89"></A>meat.
<A NAME="90"></A><BR><BR>Telemachus saw her long before any one else did. He was sitting 
<A NAME="91"></A>moodily among the suitors thinking about his brave father, and how he would 
<A NAME="92"></A>send them flying out of the house, if he were to come to his own again 
<A NAME="93"></A>and be honoured as in days gone by. Thus brooding as he sat among them, 
<A NAME="94"></A>he caught sight of Minerva and went straight to the gate, for he was vexed 
<A NAME="95"></A>that a stranger should be kept waiting for admittance. He took her right 
<A NAME="96"></A>hand in his own, and bade her give him her spear. "Welcome," said he, "to 
<A NAME="97"></A>our house, and when you have partaken of food you shall tell us what you 
<A NAME="98"></A>have come for."
<A NAME="99"></A><BR><BR>He led the way as he spoke, and Minerva followed him. When they 
<A NAME="100"></A>were within he took her spear and set it in the spear- stand against a 
<A NAME="101"></A>strong bearing-post along with the many other spears of his unhappy father, 
<A NAME="102"></A>and he conducted her to a richly decorated seat under which he threw a 
<A NAME="103"></A>cloth of damask. There was a footstool also for her feet, and he set another 
<A NAME="104"></A>seat near her for himself, away from the suitors, that she might not be 
<A NAME="105"></A>annoyed while eating by their noise and insolence, and that he might ask 
<A NAME="106"></A>her more freely about his father.
<A NAME="107"></A><BR><BR>A maid servant then brought them water in a beautiful golden ewer 
<A NAME="108"></A>and poured it into a silver basin for them to wash their hands, and she 
<A NAME="109"></A>drew a clean table beside them. An upper servant brought them bread, and 
<A NAME="110"></A>offered them many good things of what there was in the house, the carver 
<A NAME="111"></A>fetched them plates of all manner of meats and set cups of gold by their 
<A NAME="112"></A>side, and a man-servant brought them wine and poured it out for 
<A NAME="113"></A>them.
<A NAME="114"></A><BR><BR>Then the suitors came in and took their places on the benches and 
<A NAME="115"></A>seats. Forthwith men servants poured water over their hands, maids went 
<A NAME="116"></A>round with the bread-baskets, pages filled the mixing-bowls with wine and 
<A NAME="117"></A>water, and they laid their hands upon the good things that were before 
<A NAME="118"></A>them. As soon as they had had enough to eat and drink they wanted music 
<A NAME="119"></A>and dancing, which are the crowning embellishments of a banquet, so a servant 
<A NAME="120"></A>brought a lyre to Phemius, whom they compelled perforce to sing to them. 
<A NAME="121"></A>As soon as he touched his lyre and began to sing Telemachus spoke low to 
<A NAME="122"></A>Minerva, with his head close to hers that no man might 
<A NAME="123"></A>hear.
<A NAME="124"></A><BR><BR>"I hope, sir," said he, "that you will not be offended with what 
<A NAME="125"></A>I am going to say. Singing comes cheap to those who do not pay for it, 
<A NAME="126"></A>and all this is done at the cost of one whose bones lie rotting in some 
<A NAME="127"></A>wilderness or grinding to powder in the surf. If these men were to see 
<A NAME="128"></A>my father come back to Ithaca they would pray for longer legs rather than 
<A NAME="129"></A>a longer purse, for money would not serve them; but he, alas, has fallen 
<A NAME="130"></A>on an ill fate, and even when people do sometimes say that he is coming, 
<A NAME="131"></A>we no longer heed them; we shall never see him again. And now, sir, tell 
<A NAME="132"></A>me and tell me true, who you are and where you come from. Tell me of your 
<A NAME="133"></A>town and parents, what manner of ship you came in, how your crew brought 
<A NAME="134"></A>you to Ithaca, and of what nation they declared themselves to be- for you 
<A NAME="135"></A>cannot have come by land. Tell me also truly, for I want to know, are you 
<A NAME="136"></A>a stranger to this house, or have you been here in my father's time? In 
<A NAME="137"></A>the old days we had many visitors for my father went about much 
<A NAME="138"></A>himself."
<A NAME="139"></A><BR><BR>And Minerva answered, "I will tell you truly and particularly all 
<A NAME="140"></A>about it. I am Mentes, son of Anchialus, and I am King of the Taphians. 
<A NAME="141"></A>I have come here with my ship and crew, on a voyage to men of a foreign 
<A NAME="142"></A>tongue being bound for Temesa with a cargo of iron, and I shall bring back 
<A NAME="143"></A>copper. As for my ship, it lies over yonder off the open country away from 
<A NAME="144"></A>the town, in the harbour Rheithron under the wooded mountain Neritum. Our 
<A NAME="145"></A>fathers were friends before us, as old Laertes will tell you, if you will 
<A NAME="146"></A>go and ask him. They say, however, that he never comes to town now, and 
<A NAME="147"></A>lives by himself in the country, faring hardly, with an old woman to look 
<A NAME="148"></A>after him and get his dinner for him, when he comes in tired from pottering 
<A NAME="149"></A>about his vineyard. They told me your father was at home again, and that 
<A NAME="150"></A>was why I came, but it seems the gods are still keeping him back, for he 
<A NAME="151"></A>is not dead yet not on the mainland. It is more likely he is on some sea-girt 
<A NAME="152"></A>island in mid ocean, or a prisoner among savages who are detaining him 
<A NAME="153"></A>against his will I am no prophet, and know very little about omens, but 
<A NAME="154"></A>I speak as it is borne in upon me from heaven, and assure you that he will 
<A NAME="155"></A>not be away much longer; for he is a man of such resource that even though 
<A NAME="156"></A>he were in chains of iron he would find some means of getting home again. 
<A NAME="157"></A>But tell me, and tell me true, can Ulysses really have such a fine looking 
<A NAME="158"></A>fellow for a son? You are indeed wonderfully like him about the head and 
<A NAME="159"></A>eyes, for we were close friends before he set sail for Troy where the flower 
<A NAME="160"></A>of all the Argives went also. Since that time we have never either of us 
<A NAME="161"></A>seen the other."
<A NAME="162"></A><BR><BR>"My mother," answered Telemachus, tells me I am son to Ulysses, 
<A NAME="163"></A>but it is a wise child that knows his own father. Would that I were son 
<A NAME="164"></A>to one who had grown old upon his own estates, for, since you ask me, there 
<A NAME="165"></A>is no more ill-starred man under heaven than he who they tell me is my 
<A NAME="166"></A>father."
<A NAME="167"></A><BR><BR>And Minerva said, "There is no fear of your race dying out yet, 
<A NAME="168"></A>while Penelope has such a fine son as you are. But tell me, and tell me 
<A NAME="169"></A>true, what is the meaning of all this feasting, and who are these people? 
<A NAME="170"></A>What is it all about? Have you some banquet, or is there a wedding in the 
<A NAME="171"></A>family- for no one seems to be bringing any provisions of his own? And 
<A NAME="172"></A>the guests- how atrociously they are behaving; what riot they make over 
<A NAME="173"></A>the whole house; it is enough to disgust any respectable person who comes 
<A NAME="174"></A>near them."
<A NAME="175"></A><BR><BR>"Sir," said Telemachus, "as regards your question, so long as my 
<A NAME="176"></A>father was here it was well with us and with the house, but the gods in 
<A NAME="177"></A>their displeasure have willed it otherwise, and have hidden him away more 
<A NAME="178"></A>closely than mortal man was ever yet hidden. I could have borne it better 
<A NAME="179"></A>even though he were dead, if he had fallen with his men before Troy, or 
<A NAME="180"></A>had died with friends around him when the days of his fighting were done; 
<A NAME="181"></A>for then the Achaeans would have built a mound over his ashes, and I should 
<A NAME="182"></A>myself have been heir to his renown; but now the storm-winds have spirited 
<A NAME="183"></A>him away we know not wither; he is gone without leaving so much as a trace 
<A NAME="184"></A>behind him, and I inherit nothing but dismay. Nor does the matter end simply 
<A NAME="185"></A>with grief for the loss of my father; heaven has laid sorrows upon me of 
<A NAME="186"></A>yet another kind; for the chiefs from all our islands, Dulichium, Same, 
<A NAME="187"></A>and the woodland island of Zacynthus, as also all the principal men of 
<A NAME="188"></A>Ithaca itself, are eating up my house under the pretext of paying their 
<A NAME="189"></A>court to my mother, who will neither point blank say that she will not 
<A NAME="190"></A>marry, nor yet bring matters to an end; so they are making havoc of my 
<A NAME="191"></A>estate, and before long will do so also with myself."
<A NAME="192"></A><BR><BR>"Is that so?" exclaimed Minerva, "then you do indeed want Ulysses 
<A NAME="193"></A>home again. Give him his helmet, shield, and a couple lances, and if he 
<A NAME="194"></A>is the man he was when I first knew him in our house, drinking and making 
<A NAME="195"></A>merry, he would soon lay his hands about these rascally suitors, were he 
<A NAME="196"></A>to stand once more upon his own threshold. He was then coming from Ephyra, 
<A NAME="197"></A>where he had been to beg poison for his arrows from Ilus, son of Mermerus. 
<A NAME="198"></A>Ilus feared the ever-living gods and would not give him any, but my father 
<A NAME="199"></A>let him have some, for he was very fond of him. If Ulysses is the man he 
<A NAME="200"></A>then was these suitors will have a short shrift and a sorry 
<A NAME="201"></A>wedding.
<A NAME="202"></A><BR><BR>"But there! It rests with heaven to determine whether he is to 
<A NAME="203"></A>return, and take his revenge in his own house or no; I would, however, 
<A NAME="204"></A>urge you to set about trying to get rid of these suitors at once. Take 
<A NAME="205"></A>my advice, call the Achaean heroes in assembly to-morrow -lay your case 
<A NAME="206"></A>before them, and call heaven to bear you witness. Bid the suitors take 
<A NAME="207"></A>themselves off, each to his own place, and if your mother's mind is set 
<A NAME="208"></A>on marrying again, let her go back to her father, who will find her a husband 
<A NAME="209"></A>and provide her with all the marriage gifts that so dear a daughter may 
<A NAME="210"></A>expect. As for yourself, let me prevail upon you to take the best ship 
<A NAME="211"></A>you can get, with a crew of twenty men, and go in quest of your father 
<A NAME="212"></A>who has so long been missing. Some one may tell you something, or (and 
<A NAME="213"></A>people often hear things in this way) some heaven-sent message may direct 
<A NAME="214"></A>you. First go to Pylos and ask Nestor; thence go on to Sparta and visit 
<A NAME="215"></A>Menelaus, for he got home last of all the Achaeans; if you hear that your 
<A NAME="216"></A>father is alive and on his way home, you can put up with the waste these 
<A NAME="217"></A>suitors will make for yet another twelve months. If on the other hand you 
<A NAME="218"></A>hear of his death, come home at once, celebrate his funeral rites with 
<A NAME="219"></A>all due pomp, build a barrow to his memory, and make your mother marry 
<A NAME="220"></A>again. Then, having done all this, think it well over in your mind how, 
<A NAME="221"></A>by fair means or foul, you may kill these suitors in your own house. You 
<A NAME="222"></A>are too old to plead infancy any longer; have you not heard how people 
<A NAME="223"></A>are singing Orestes' praises for having killed his father's murderer Aegisthus? 
<A NAME="224"></A>You are a fine, smart looking fellow; show your mettle, then, and make 
<A NAME="225"></A>yourself a name in story. Now, however, I must go back to my ship and to 
<A NAME="226"></A>my crew, who will be impatient if I keep them waiting longer; think the 
<A NAME="227"></A>matter over for yourself, and remember what I have said to 
<A NAME="228"></A>you."
<A NAME="229"></A><BR><BR>"Sir," answered Telemachus, "it has been very kind of you to talk 
<A NAME="230"></A>to me in this way, as though I were your own son, and I will do all you 
<A NAME="231"></A>tell me; I know you want to be getting on with your voyage, but stay a 
<A NAME="232"></A>little longer till you have taken a bath and refreshed yourself. I will 
<A NAME="233"></A>then give you a present, and you shall go on your way rejoicing; I will 
<A NAME="234"></A>give you one of great beauty and value- a keepsake such as only dear friends 
<A NAME="235"></A>give to one another."
<A NAME="236"></A><BR><BR>Minerva answered, "Do not try to keep me, for I would be on my 
<A NAME="237"></A>way at once. As for any present you may be disposed to make me, keep it 
<A NAME="238"></A>till I come again, and I will take it home with me. You shall give me a 
<A NAME="239"></A>very good one, and I will give you one of no less value in 
<A NAME="240"></A>return."
<A NAME="241"></A><BR><BR>With these words she flew away like a bird into the air, but she 
<A NAME="242"></A>had given Telemachus courage, and had made him think more than ever about 
<A NAME="243"></A>his father. He felt the change, wondered at it, and knew that the stranger 
<A NAME="244"></A>had been a god, so he went straight to where the suitors were 
<A NAME="245"></A>sitting.
<A NAME="246"></A><BR><BR>Phemius was still singing, and his hearers sat rapt in silence 
<A NAME="247"></A>as he told the sad tale of the return from Troy, and the ills Minerva had 
<A NAME="248"></A>laid upon the Achaeans. Penelope, daughter of Icarius, heard his song from 
<A NAME="249"></A>her room upstairs, and came down by the great staircase, not alone, but 
<A NAME="250"></A>attended by two of her handmaids. When she reached the suitors she stood 
<A NAME="251"></A>by one of the bearing posts that supported the roof of the cloisters with 
<A NAME="252"></A>a staid maiden on either side of her. She held a veil, moreover, before 
<A NAME="253"></A>her face, and was weeping bitterly.
<A NAME="254"></A><BR><BR>"Phemius," she cried, "you know many another feat of gods and heroes, 
<A NAME="255"></A>such as poets love to celebrate. Sing the suitors some one of these, and 
<A NAME="256"></A>let them drink their wine in silence, but cease this sad tale, for it breaks 
<A NAME="257"></A>my sorrowful heart, and reminds me of my lost husband whom I mourn ever 
<A NAME="258"></A>without ceasing, and whose name was great over all Hellas and middle 
<A NAME="259"></A>Argos."
<A NAME="260"></A><BR><BR>"Mother," answered Telemachus, "let the bard sing what he has a 
<A NAME="261"></A>mind to; bards do not make the ills they sing of; it is Jove, not they, 
<A NAME="262"></A>who makes them, and who sends weal or woe upon mankind according to his 
<A NAME="263"></A>own good pleasure. This fellow means no harm by singing the ill-fated return 
<A NAME="264"></A>of the Danaans, for people always applaud the latest songs most warmly. 
<A NAME="265"></A>Make up your mind to it and bear it; Ulysses is not the only man who never 
<A NAME="266"></A>came back from Troy, but many another went down as well as he. Go, then, 
<A NAME="267"></A>within the house and busy yourself with your daily duties, your loom, your 
<A NAME="268"></A>distaff, and the ordering of your servants; for speech is man's matter, 
<A NAME="269"></A>and mine above all others- for it is I who am master 
<A NAME="270"></A>here."
<A NAME="271"></A><BR><BR>She went wondering back into the house, and laid her son's saying 
<A NAME="272"></A>in her heart. Then, going upstairs with her handmaids into her room, she 
<A NAME="273"></A>mourned her dear husband till Minerva shed sweet sleep over her eyes. But 
<A NAME="274"></A>the suitors were clamorous throughout the covered cloisters, and prayed 
<A NAME="275"></A>each one that he might be her bed fellow.
<A NAME="276"></A><BR><BR>Then Telemachus spoke, "Shameless," he cried, "and insolent suitors, 
<A NAME="277"></A>let us feast at our pleasure now, and let there be no brawling, for it 
<A NAME="278"></A>is a rare thing to hear a man with such a divine voice as Phemius has; 
<A NAME="279"></A>but in the morning meet me in full assembly that I may give you formal 
<A NAME="280"></A>notice to depart, and feast at one another's houses, turn and turn about, 
<A NAME="281"></A>at your own cost. If on the other hand you choose to persist in spunging 
<A NAME="282"></A>upon one man, heaven help me, but Jove shall reckon with you in full, and 
<A NAME="283"></A>when you fall in my father's house there shall be no man to avenge 
<A NAME="284"></A>you."
<A NAME="285"></A><BR><BR>The suitors bit their lips as they heard him, and marvelled at 
<A NAME="286"></A>the boldness of his speech. Then, Antinous, son of Eupeithes, said, "The 
<A NAME="287"></A>gods seem to have given you lessons in bluster and tall talking; may Jove 
<A NAME="288"></A>never grant you to be chief in Ithaca as your father was before 
<A NAME="289"></A>you."
<A NAME="290"></A><BR><BR>Telemachus answered, "Antinous, do not chide with me, but, god 
<A NAME="291"></A>willing, I will be chief too if I can. Is this the worst fate you can think 
<A NAME="292"></A>of for me? It is no bad thing to be a chief, for it brings both riches 
<A NAME="293"></A>and honour. Still, now that Ulysses is dead there are many great men in 
<A NAME="294"></A>Ithaca both old and young, and some other may take the lead among them; 
<A NAME="295"></A>nevertheless I will be chief in my own house, and will rule those whom 
<A NAME="296"></A>Ulysses has won for me."
<A NAME="297"></A><BR><BR>Then Eurymachus, son of Polybus, answered, "It rests with heaven 
<A NAME="298"></A>to decide who shall be chief among us, but you shall be master in your 
<A NAME="299"></A>own house and over your own possessions; no one while there is a man in 
<A NAME="300"></A>Ithaca shall do you violence nor rob you. And now, my good fellow, I want 
<A NAME="301"></A>to know about this stranger. What country does he come from? Of what family 
<A NAME="302"></A>is he, and where is his estate? Has he brought you news about the return 
<A NAME="303"></A>of your father, or was he on business of his own? He seemed a well-to-do 
<A NAME="304"></A>man, but he hurried off so suddenly that he was gone in a moment before 
<A NAME="305"></A>we could get to know him."
<A NAME="306"></A><BR><BR>"My father is dead and gone," answered Telemachus, "and even if 
<A NAME="307"></A>some rumour reaches me I put no more faith in it now. My mother does indeed 
<A NAME="308"></A>sometimes send for a soothsayer and question him, but I give his prophecyings 
<A NAME="309"></A>no heed. As for the stranger, he was Mentes, son of Anchialus, chief of 
<A NAME="310"></A>the Taphians, an old friend of my father's." But in his heart he knew that 
<A NAME="311"></A>it had been the goddess.
<A NAME="312"></A><BR><BR>The suitors then returned to their singing and dancing until the 
<A NAME="313"></A>evening; but when night fell upon their pleasuring they went home to bed 
<A NAME="314"></A>each in his own abode. Telemachus's room was high up in a tower that looked 
<A NAME="315"></A>on to the outer court; hither, then, he hied, brooding and full of thought. 
<A NAME="316"></A>A good old woman, Euryclea, daughter of Ops, the son of Pisenor, went before 
<A NAME="317"></A>him with a couple of blazing torches. Laertes had bought her with his own 
<A NAME="318"></A>money when she was quite young; he gave the worth of twenty oxen for her, 
<A NAME="319"></A>and shewed as much respect to her in his household as he did to his own 
<A NAME="320"></A>wedded wife, but he did not take her to his bed for he feared his wife's 
<A NAME="321"></A>resentment. She it was who now lighted Telemachus to his room, and she 
<A NAME="322"></A>loved him better than any of the other women in the house did, for she 
<A NAME="323"></A>had nursed him when he was a baby. He opened the door of his bed room and 
<A NAME="324"></A>sat down upon the bed; as he took off his shirt he gave it to the good 
<A NAME="325"></A>old woman, who folded it tidily up, and hung it for him over a peg by his 
<A NAME="326"></A>bed side, after which she went out, pulled the door to by a silver catch, 
<A NAME="327"></A>and drew the bolt home by means of the strap. But Telemachus as he lay 
<A NAME="328"></A>covered with a woollen fleece kept thinking all night through of his intended 
<A NAME="329"></A>voyage of the counsel that Minerva had given him.
