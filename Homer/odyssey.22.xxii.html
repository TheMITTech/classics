<A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A>Then Ulysses tore off his rags, and sprang on to the broad pavement with 
<A NAME="11"></A>his bow and his quiver full of arrows. He shed the arrows on to the ground 
<A NAME="12"></A>at his feet and said, "The mighty contest is at an end. I will now see 
<A NAME="13"></A>whether Apollo will vouchsafe it to me to hit another mark which no man 
<A NAME="14"></A>has yet hit."
<A NAME="15"></A><BR><BR>On this he aimed a deadly arrow at Antinous, who was about to take 
<A NAME="16"></A>up a two-handled gold cup to drink his wine and already had it in his hands. 
<A NAME="17"></A>He had no thought of death- who amongst all the revellers would think that 
<A NAME="18"></A>one man, however brave, would stand alone among so many and kill him? The 
<A NAME="19"></A>arrow struck Antinous in the throat, and the point went clean through his 
<A NAME="20"></A>neck, so that he fell over and the cup dropped from his hand, while a thick 
<A NAME="21"></A>stream of blood gushed from his nostrils. He kicked the table from him 
<A NAME="22"></A>and upset the things on it, so that the bread and roasted meats were all 
<A NAME="23"></A>soiled as they fell over on to the ground. The suitors were in an uproar 
<A NAME="24"></A>when they saw that a man had been hit; they sprang in dismay one and all 
<A NAME="25"></A>of them from their seats and looked everywhere towards the walls, but there 
<A NAME="26"></A>was neither shield nor spear, and they rebuked Ulysses very angrily. "Stranger," 
<A NAME="27"></A>said they, "you shall pay for shooting people in this way: om yi you shall 
<A NAME="28"></A>see no other contest; you are a doomed man; he whom you have slain was 
<A NAME="29"></A>the foremost youth in Ithaca, and the vultures shall devour you for having 
<A NAME="30"></A>killed him."
<A NAME="31"></A><BR><BR>Thus they spoke, for they thought that he had killed Antinous by 
<A NAME="32"></A>mistake, and did not perceive that death was hanging over the head of every 
<A NAME="33"></A>one of them. But Ulysses glared at them and said:
<A NAME="34"></A><BR><BR>"Dogs, did you think that I should not come back from Troy? You 
<A NAME="35"></A>have wasted my substance, have forced my women servants to lie with you, 
<A NAME="36"></A>and have wooed my wife while I was still living. You have feared neither 
<A NAME="37"></A>Cod nor man, and now you shall die."
<A NAME="38"></A><BR><BR>They turned pale with fear as he spoke, and every man looked round 
<A NAME="39"></A>about to see whither he might fly for safety, but Eurymachus alone 
<A NAME="40"></A>spoke.
<A NAME="41"></A><BR><BR>"If you are Ulysses," said he, "then what you have said is just. 
<A NAME="42"></A>We have done much wrong on your lands and in your house. But Antinous who 
<A NAME="43"></A>was the head and front of the offending lies low already. It was all his 
<A NAME="44"></A>doing. It was not that he wanted to marry Penelope; he did not so much 
<A NAME="45"></A>care about that; what he wanted was something quite different, and Jove 
<A NAME="46"></A>has not vouchsafed it to him; he wanted to kill your son and to be chief 
<A NAME="47"></A>man in Ithaca. Now, therefore, that he has met the death which was his 
<A NAME="48"></A>due, spare the lives of your people. We will make everything good among 
<A NAME="49"></A>ourselves, and pay you in full for all that we have eaten and drunk. Each 
<A NAME="50"></A>one of us shall pay you a fine worth twenty oxen, and we will keep on giving 
<A NAME="51"></A>you gold and bronze till your heart is softened. Until we have done this 
<A NAME="52"></A>no one can complain of your being enraged against us."
<A NAME="53"></A><BR><BR>Ulysses again glared at him and said, "Though you should give me 
<A NAME="54"></A>all that you have in the world both now and all that you ever shall have, 
<A NAME="55"></A>I will not stay my hand till I have paid all of you in full. You must fight, 
<A NAME="56"></A>or fly for your lives; and fly, not a man of you shall."
<A NAME="57"></A><BR><BR>Their hearts sank as they heard him, but Eurymachus again spoke 
<A NAME="58"></A>saying:
<A NAME="59"></A><BR><BR>"My friends, this man will give us no quarter. He will stand where 
<A NAME="60"></A>he is and shoot us down till he has killed every man among us. Let us then 
<A NAME="61"></A>show fight; draw your swords, and hold up the tables to shield you from 
<A NAME="62"></A>his arrows. Let us have at him with a rush, to drive him from the pavement 
<A NAME="63"></A>and doorway: we can then get through into the town, and raise such an alarm 
<A NAME="64"></A>as shall soon stay his shooting."
<A NAME="65"></A><BR><BR>As he spoke he drew his keen blade of bronze, sharpened on both 
<A NAME="66"></A>sides, and with a loud cry sprang towards Ulysses, but Ulysses instantly 
<A NAME="67"></A>shot an arrow into his breast that caught him by the nipple and fixed itself 
<A NAME="68"></A>in his liver. He dropped his sword and fell doubled up over his table. 
<A NAME="69"></A>The cup and all the meats went over on to the ground as he smote the earth 
<A NAME="70"></A>with his forehead in the agonies of death, and he kicked the stool with 
<A NAME="71"></A>his feet until his eyes were closed in darkness.
<A NAME="72"></A><BR><BR>Then Amphinomus drew his sword and made straight at Ulysses to 
<A NAME="73"></A>try and get him away from the door; but Telemachus was too quick for him, 
<A NAME="74"></A>and struck him from behind; the spear caught him between the shoulders 
<A NAME="75"></A>and went right through his chest, so that he fell heavily to the ground 
<A NAME="76"></A>and struck the earth with his forehead. Then Telemachus sprang away from 
<A NAME="77"></A>him, leaving his spear still in the body, for he feared that if he stayed 
<A NAME="78"></A>to draw it out, some one of the Achaeans might come up and hack at him 
<A NAME="79"></A>with his sword, or knock him down, so he set off at a run, and immediately 
<A NAME="80"></A>was at his father's side. Then he said:
<A NAME="81"></A><BR><BR>"Father, let me bring you a shield, two spears, and a brass helmet 
<A NAME="82"></A>for your temples. I will arm myself as well, and will bring other armour 
<A NAME="83"></A>for the swineherd and the stockman, for we had better be 
<A NAME="84"></A>armed."
<A NAME="85"></A><BR><BR>"Run and fetch them," answered Ulysses, "while my arrows hold out, 
<A NAME="86"></A>or when I am alone they may get me away from the door."
<A NAME="87"></A><BR><BR>Telemachus did as his father said, and went off to the store room 
<A NAME="88"></A>where the armour was kept. He chose four shields, eight spears, and four 
<A NAME="89"></A>brass helmets with horse-hair plumes. He brought them with all speed to 
<A NAME="90"></A>his father, and armed himself first, while the stockman and the swineherd 
<A NAME="91"></A>also put on their armour, and took their places near Ulysses. Meanwhile 
<A NAME="92"></A>Ulysses, as long as his arrows lasted, had been shooting the suitors one 
<A NAME="93"></A>by one, and they fell thick on one another: when his arrows gave out, he 
<A NAME="94"></A>set the bow to stand against the end wall of the house by the door post, 
<A NAME="95"></A>and hung a shield four hides thick about his shoulders; on his comely head 
<A NAME="96"></A>he set his helmet, well wrought with a crest of horse-hair that nodded 
<A NAME="97"></A>menacingly above it, and he grasped two redoubtable bronze-shod 
<A NAME="98"></A>spears.
<A NAME="99"></A><BR><BR>Now there was a trap door on the wall, while at one end of the 
<A NAME="100"></A>pavement there was an exit leading to a narrow passage, and this exit was 
<A NAME="101"></A>closed by a well-made door. Ulysses told Philoetius to stand by this door 
<A NAME="102"></A>and guard it, for only one person could attack it at a time. But Agelaus 
<A NAME="103"></A>shouted out, "Cannot some one go up to the trap door and tell the people 
<A NAME="104"></A>what is going on? Help would come at once, and we should soon make an end 
<A NAME="105"></A>of this man and his shooting."
<A NAME="106"></A><BR><BR>"This may not be, Agelaus," answered Melanthius, "the mouth of 
<A NAME="107"></A>the narrow passage is dangerously near the entrance to the outer court. 
<A NAME="108"></A>One brave man could prevent any number from getting in. But I know what 
<A NAME="109"></A>I will do, I will bring you arms from the store room, for I am sure it 
<A NAME="110"></A>is there that Ulysses and his son have put them."
<A NAME="111"></A><BR><BR>On this the goatherd Melanthius went by back passages to the store 
<A NAME="112"></A>room of Ulysses, house. There he chose twelve shields, with as many helmets 
<A NAME="113"></A>and spears, and brought them back as fast as he could to give them to the 
<A NAME="114"></A>suitors. Ulysses' heart began to fail him when he saw the suitors putting 
<A NAME="115"></A>on their armour and brandishing their spears. He saw the greatness of the 
<A NAME="116"></A>danger, and said to Telemachus, "Some one of the women inside is helping 
<A NAME="117"></A>the suitors against us, or it may be Melanthius."
<A NAME="118"></A><BR><BR>Telemachus answered, "The fault, father, is mine, and mine only; 
<A NAME="119"></A>I left the store room door open, and they have kept a sharper look out 
<A NAME="120"></A>than I have. Go, Eumaeus, put the door to, and see whether it is one of 
<A NAME="121"></A>the women who is doing this, or whether, as I suspect, it is Melanthius 
<A NAME="122"></A>the son of Dolius."
<A NAME="123"></A><BR><BR>Thus did they converse. Meanwhile Melanthius was again going to 
<A NAME="124"></A>the store room to fetch more armour, but the swineherd saw him and said 
<A NAME="125"></A>to Ulysses who was beside him, "Ulysses, noble son of Laertes, it is that 
<A NAME="126"></A>scoundrel Melanthius, just as we suspected, who is going to the store room. 
<A NAME="127"></A>Say, shall I kill him, if I can get the better of him, or shall I bring 
<A NAME="128"></A>him here that you may take your own revenge for all the many wrongs that 
<A NAME="129"></A>he has done in your house?"
<A NAME="130"></A><BR><BR>Ulysses answered, "Telemachus and I will hold these suitors in 
<A NAME="131"></A>check, no matter what they do; go back both of you and bind Melanthius' 
<A NAME="132"></A>hands and feet behind him. Throw him into the store room and make the door 
<A NAME="133"></A>fast behind you; then fasten a noose about his body, and string him close 
<A NAME="134"></A>up to the rafters from a high bearing-post, that he may linger on in an 
<A NAME="135"></A>agony."
<A NAME="136"></A><BR><BR>Thus did he speak, and they did even as he had said; they went 
<A NAME="137"></A>to the store room, which they entered before Melanthius saw them, for he 
<A NAME="138"></A>was busy searching for arms in the innermost part of the room, so the two 
<A NAME="139"></A>took their stand on either side of the door and waited. By and by Melanthius 
<A NAME="140"></A>came out with a helmet in one hand, and an old dry-rotted shield in the 
<A NAME="141"></A>other, which had been borne by Laertes when he was young, but which had 
<A NAME="142"></A>been long since thrown aside, and the straps had become unsewn; on this 
<A NAME="143"></A>the two seized him, dragged him back by the hair, and threw him struggling 
<A NAME="144"></A>to the ground. They bent his hands and feet well behind his back, and bound 
<A NAME="145"></A>them tight with a painful bond as Ulysses had told them; then they fastened 
<A NAME="146"></A>a noose about his body and strung him up from a high pillar till he was 
<A NAME="147"></A>close up to the rafters, and over him did you then vaunt, O swineherd Eumaeus, 
<A NAME="148"></A>saying, "Melanthius, you will pass the night on a soft bed as you deserve. 
<A NAME="149"></A>You will know very well when morning comes from the streams of Oceanus, 
<A NAME="150"></A>and it is time for you to be driving in your goats for the suitors to feast 
<A NAME="151"></A>on."
<A NAME="152"></A><BR><BR>There, then, they left him in very cruel bondage, and having put 
<A NAME="153"></A>on their armour they closed the door behind them and went back to take 
<A NAME="154"></A>their places by the side of Ulysses; whereon the four men stood in the 
<A NAME="155"></A>cloister, fierce and full of fury; nevertheless, those who were in the 
<A NAME="156"></A>body of the court were still both brave and many. Then Jove's daughter 
<A NAME="157"></A>Minerva came up to them, having assumed the voice and form of Mentor. Ulysses 
<A NAME="158"></A>was glad when he saw her and said, "Mentor, lend me your help, and forget 
<A NAME="159"></A>not your old comrade, nor the many good turns he has done you. Besides, 
<A NAME="160"></A>you are my age-mate."
<A NAME="161"></A><BR><BR>But all the time he felt sure it was Minerva, and the suitors from 
<A NAME="162"></A>the other side raised an uproar when they saw her. Agelaus was the first 
<A NAME="163"></A>to reproach her. "Mentor," he cried, "do not let Ulysses beguile you into 
<A NAME="164"></A>siding with him and fighting the suitors. This is what we will do: when 
<A NAME="165"></A>we have killed these people, father and son, we will kill you too. You 
<A NAME="166"></A>shall pay for it with your head, and when we have killed you, we will take 
<A NAME="167"></A>all you have, in doors or out, and bring it into hotch-pot with Ulysses' 
<A NAME="168"></A>property; we will not let your sons live in your house, nor your daughters, 
<A NAME="169"></A>nor shall your widow continue to live in the city of 
<A NAME="170"></A>Ithaca."
<A NAME="171"></A><BR><BR>This made Minerva still more furious, so she scolded Ulysses very 
<A NAME="172"></A>angrily. "Ulysses," said she, "your strength and prowess are no longer 
<A NAME="173"></A>what they were when you fought for nine long years among the Trojans about 
<A NAME="174"></A>the noble lady Helen. You killed many a man in those days, and it was through 
<A NAME="175"></A>your stratagem that Priam's city was taken. How comes it that you are so 
<A NAME="176"></A>lamentably less valiant now that you are on your own ground, face to face 
<A NAME="177"></A>with the suitors in your own house? Come on, my good fellow, stand by my 
<A NAME="178"></A>side and see how Mentor, son of Alcinous shall fight your foes and requite 
<A NAME="179"></A>your kindnesses conferred upon him."
<A NAME="180"></A><BR><BR>But she would not give him full victory as yet, for she wished 
<A NAME="181"></A>still further to prove his own prowess and that of his brave son, so she 
<A NAME="182"></A>flew up to one of the rafters in the roof of the cloister and sat upon 
<A NAME="183"></A>it in the form of a swallow.
<A NAME="184"></A><BR><BR>Meanwhile Agelaus son of Damastor, Eurynomus, Amphimedon, Demoptolemus, 
<A NAME="185"></A>Pisander, and Polybus son of Polyctor bore the brunt of the fight upon 
<A NAME="186"></A>the suitors' side; of all those who were still fighting for their lives 
<A NAME="187"></A>they were by far the most valiant, for the others had already fallen under 
<A NAME="188"></A>the arrows of Ulysses. Agelaus shouted to them and said, "My friends, he 
<A NAME="189"></A>will soon have to leave off, for Mentor has gone away after having done 
<A NAME="190"></A>nothing for him but brag. They are standing at the doors unsupported. Do 
<A NAME="191"></A>not aim at him all at once, but six of you throw your spears first, and 
<A NAME="192"></A>see if you cannot cover yourselves with glory by killing him. When he has 
<A NAME="193"></A>fallen we need not be uneasy about the others."
<A NAME="194"></A><BR><BR>They threw their spears as he bade them, but Minerva made them 
<A NAME="195"></A>all of no effect. One hit the door post; another went against the door; 
<A NAME="196"></A>the pointed shaft of another struck the wall; and as soon as they had avoided 
<A NAME="197"></A>all the spears of the suitors Ulysses said to his own men, "My friends, 
<A NAME="198"></A>I should say we too had better let drive into the middle of them, or they 
<A NAME="199"></A>will crown all the harm they have done us by us outright."
<A NAME="200"></A><BR><BR>They therefore aimed straight in front of them and threw their 
<A NAME="201"></A>spears. Ulysses killed Demoptolemus, Telemachus Euryades, Eumaeus Elatus, 
<A NAME="202"></A>while the stockman killed Pisander. These all bit the dust, and as the 
<A NAME="203"></A>others drew back into a corner Ulysses and his men rushed forward and regained 
<A NAME="204"></A>their spears by drawing them from the bodies of the 
<A NAME="205"></A>dead.
<A NAME="206"></A><BR><BR>The suitors now aimed a second time, but again Minerva made their 
<A NAME="207"></A>weapons for the most part without effect. One hit a bearing-post of the 
<A NAME="208"></A>cloister; another went against the door; while the pointed shaft of another 
<A NAME="209"></A>struck the wall. Still, Amphimedon just took a piece of the top skin from 
<A NAME="210"></A>off Telemachus's wrist, and Ctesippus managed to graze Eumaeus's shoulder 
<A NAME="211"></A>above his shield; but the spear went on and fell to the ground. Then Ulysses 
<A NAME="212"></A>and his men let drive into the crowd of suitors. Ulysses hit Eurydamas, 
<A NAME="213"></A>Telemachus Amphimedon, and Eumaeus Polybus. After this the stockman hit 
<A NAME="214"></A>Ctesippus in the breast, and taunted him saying, "Foul-mouthed son of Polytherses, 
<A NAME="215"></A>do not be so foolish as to talk wickedly another time, but let heaven direct 
<A NAME="216"></A>your speech, for the gods are far stronger than men. I make you a present 
<A NAME="217"></A>of this advice to repay you for the foot which you gave Ulysses when he 
<A NAME="218"></A>was begging about in his own house."
<A NAME="219"></A><BR><BR>Thus spoke the stockman, and Ulysses struck the son of Damastor 
<A NAME="220"></A>with a spear in close fight, while Telemachus hit Leocritus son of Evenor 
<A NAME="221"></A>in the belly, and the dart went clean through him, so that he fell forward 
<A NAME="222"></A>full on his face upon the ground. Then Minerva from her seat on the rafter 
<A NAME="223"></A>held up her deadly aegis, and the hearts of the suitors quailed. They fled 
<A NAME="224"></A>to the other end of the court like a herd of cattle maddened by the gadfly 
<A NAME="225"></A>in early summer when the days are at their longest. As eagle-beaked, crook-taloned 
<A NAME="226"></A>vultures from the mountains swoop down on the smaller birds that cower 
<A NAME="227"></A>in flocks upon the ground, and kill them, for they cannot either fight 
<A NAME="228"></A>or fly, and lookers on enjoy the sport- even so did Ulysses and his men 
<A NAME="229"></A>fall upon the suitors and smite them on every side. They made a horrible 
<A NAME="230"></A>groaning as their brains were being battered in, and the ground seethed 
<A NAME="231"></A>with their blood.
<A NAME="232"></A><BR><BR>Leiodes then caught the knees of Ulysses and said, "Ulysses I beseech 
<A NAME="233"></A>you have mercy upon me and spare me. I never wronged any of the women in 
<A NAME="234"></A>your house either in word or deed, and I tried to stop the others. I saw 
<A NAME="235"></A>them, but they would not listen, and now they are paying for their folly. 
<A NAME="236"></A>I was their sacrificing priest; if you kill me, I shall die without having 
<A NAME="237"></A>done anything to deserve it, and shall have got no thanks for all the good 
<A NAME="238"></A>that I did."
<A NAME="239"></A><BR><BR>Ulysses looked sternly at him and answered, "If you were their 
<A NAME="240"></A>sacrificing priest, you must have prayed many a time that it might be long 
<A NAME="241"></A>before I got home again, and that you might marry my wife and have children 
<A NAME="242"></A>by her. Therefore you shall die."
<A NAME="243"></A><BR><BR>With these words he picked up the sword that Agelaus had dropped 
<A NAME="244"></A>when he was being killed, and which was lying upon the ground. Then he 
<A NAME="245"></A>struck Leiodes on the back of his neck, so that his head fell rolling in 
<A NAME="246"></A>the dust while he was yet speaking.
<A NAME="247"></A><BR><BR>The minstrel Phemius son of Terpes- he who had been forced by the 
<A NAME="248"></A>suitors to sing to them- now tried to save his life. He was standing near 
<A NAME="249"></A>towards the trap door, and held his lyre in his hand. He did not know whether 
<A NAME="250"></A>to fly out of the cloister and sit down by the altar of Jove that was in 
<A NAME="251"></A>the outer court, and on which both Laertes and Ulysses had offered up the 
<A NAME="252"></A>thigh bones of many an ox, or whether to go straight up to Ulysses and 
<A NAME="253"></A>embrace his knees, but in the end he deemed it best to embrace Ulysses' 
<A NAME="254"></A>knees. So he laid his lyre on the ground the ground between the mixing-bowl 
<A NAME="255"></A>and the silver-studded seat; then going up to Ulysses he caught hold of 
<A NAME="256"></A>his knees and said, "Ulysses, I beseech you have mercy on me and spare 
<A NAME="257"></A>me. You will be sorry for it afterwards if you kill a bard who can sing 
<A NAME="258"></A>both for gods and men as I can. I make all my lays myself, and heaven visits 
<A NAME="259"></A>me with every kind of inspiration. I would sing to you as though you were 
<A NAME="260"></A>a god, do not therefore be in such a hurry to cut my head off. Your own 
<A NAME="261"></A>son Telemachus will tell you that I did not want to frequent your house 
<A NAME="262"></A>and sing to the suitors after their meals, but they were too many and too 
<A NAME="263"></A>strong for me, so they made me."
<A NAME="264"></A><BR><BR>Telemachus heard him, and at once went up to his father. "Hold!" 
<A NAME="265"></A>he cried, "the man is guiltless, do him no hurt; and we will Medon too, 
<A NAME="266"></A>who was always good to me when I was a boy, unless Philoetius or Eumaeus 
<A NAME="267"></A>has already killed him, or he has fallen in your way when you were raging 
<A NAME="268"></A>about the court."
<A NAME="269"></A><BR><BR>Medon caught these words of Telemachus, for he was crouching under 
<A NAME="270"></A>a seat beneath which he had hidden by covering himself up with a freshly 
<A NAME="271"></A>flayed heifer's hide, so he threw off the hide, went up to Telemachus, 
<A NAME="272"></A>and laid hold of his knees.
<A NAME="273"></A><BR><BR>"Here I am, my dear sir," said he, "stay your hand therefore, and 
<A NAME="274"></A>tell your father, or he will kill me in his rage against the suitors for 
<A NAME="275"></A>having wasted his substance and been so foolishly disrespectful to 
<A NAME="276"></A>yourself."
<A NAME="277"></A><BR><BR>Ulysses smiled at him and answered, "Fear not; Telemachus has saved 
<A NAME="278"></A>your life, that you may know in future, and tell other people, how greatly 
<A NAME="279"></A>better good deeds prosper than evil ones. Go, therefore, outside the cloisters 
<A NAME="280"></A>into the outer court, and be out of the way of the slaughter- you and the 
<A NAME="281"></A>bard- while I finish my work here inside."
<A NAME="282"></A><BR><BR>The pair went into the outer court as fast as they could, and sat 
<A NAME="283"></A>down by Jove's great altar, looking fearfully round, and still expecting 
<A NAME="284"></A>that they would be killed. Then Ulysses searched the whole court carefully 
<A NAME="285"></A>over, to see if anyone had managed to hide himself and was still living, 
<A NAME="286"></A>but he found them all lying in the dust and weltering in their blood. They 
<A NAME="287"></A>were like fishes which fishermen have netted out of the sea, and thrown 
<A NAME="288"></A>upon the beach to lie gasping for water till the heat of the sun makes 
<A NAME="289"></A>an end of them. Even so were the suitors lying all huddled up one against 
<A NAME="290"></A>the other.
<A NAME="291"></A><BR><BR>Then Ulysses said to Telemachus, "Call nurse Euryclea; I have something 
<A NAME="292"></A>to say to her."
<A NAME="293"></A><BR><BR>Telemachus went and knocked at the door of the women's room. "Make 
<A NAME="294"></A>haste," said he, "you old woman who have been set over all the other women 
<A NAME="295"></A>in the house. Come outside; my father wishes to speak to 
<A NAME="296"></A>you."
<A NAME="297"></A><BR><BR>When Euryclea heard this she unfastened the door of the women's 
<A NAME="298"></A>room and came out, following Telemachus. She found Ulysses among the corpses 
<A NAME="299"></A>bespattered with blood and filth like a lion that has just been devouring 
<A NAME="300"></A>an ox, and his breast and both his cheeks are all bloody, so that he is 
<A NAME="301"></A>a fearful sight; even so was Ulysses besmirched from head to foot with 
<A NAME="302"></A>gore. When she saw all the corpses and such a quantity of blood, she was 
<A NAME="303"></A>beginning to cry out for joy, for she saw that a great deed had been done; 
<A NAME="304"></A>but Ulysses checked her, "Old woman," said he, "rejoice in silence; restrain 
<A NAME="305"></A>yourself, and do not make any noise about it; it is an unholy thing to 
<A NAME="306"></A>vaunt over dead men. Heaven's doom and their own evil deeds have brought 
<A NAME="307"></A>these men to destruction, for they respected no man in the whole world, 
<A NAME="308"></A>neither rich nor poor, who came near them, and they have come to a bad 
<A NAME="309"></A>end as a punishment for their wickedness and folly. Now, however, tell 
<A NAME="310"></A>me which of the women in the house have misconducted themselves, and who 
<A NAME="311"></A>are innocent."
<A NAME="312"></A><BR><BR>"I will tell you the truth, my son," answered Euryclea. "There 
<A NAME="313"></A>are fifty women in the house whom we teach to do things, such as carding 
<A NAME="314"></A>wool, and all kinds of household work. Of these, twelve in all have misbehaved, 
<A NAME="315"></A>and have been wanting in respect to me, and also to Penelope. They showed 
<A NAME="316"></A>no disrespect to Telemachus, for he has only lately grown and his mother 
<A NAME="317"></A>never permitted him to give orders to the female servants; but let me go 
<A NAME="318"></A>upstairs and tell your wife all that has happened, for some god has been 
<A NAME="319"></A>sending her to sleep."
<A NAME="320"></A><BR><BR>"Do not wake her yet," answered Ulysses, "but tell the women who 
<A NAME="321"></A>have misconducted themselves to come to me."
<A NAME="322"></A><BR><BR>Euryclea left the cloister to tell the women, and make them come 
<A NAME="323"></A>to Ulysses; in the meantime he called Telemachus, the stockman, and the 
<A NAME="324"></A>swineherd. "Begin," said he, "to remove the dead, and make the women help 
<A NAME="325"></A>you. Then, get sponges and clean water to swill down the tables and seats. 
<A NAME="326"></A>When you have thoroughly cleansed the whole cloisters, take the women into 
<A NAME="327"></A>the space between the domed room and the wall of the outer court, and run 
<A NAME="328"></A>them through with your swords till they are quite dead, and have forgotten 
<A NAME="329"></A>all about love and the way in which they used to lie in secret with the 
<A NAME="330"></A>suitors."
<A NAME="331"></A><BR><BR>On this the women came down in a body, weeping and wailing bitterly. 
<A NAME="332"></A>First they carried the dead bodies out, and propped them up against one 
<A NAME="333"></A>another in the gatehouse. Ulysses ordered them about and made them do their 
<A NAME="334"></A>work quickly, so they had to carry the bodies out. When they had done this, 
<A NAME="335"></A>they cleaned all the tables and seats with sponges and water, while Telemachus 
<A NAME="336"></A>and the two others shovelled up the blood and dirt from the ground, and 
<A NAME="337"></A>the women carried it all away and put it out of doors. Then when they had 
<A NAME="338"></A>made the whole place quite clean and orderly, they took the women out and 
<A NAME="339"></A>hemmed them in the narrow space between the wall of the domed room and 
<A NAME="340"></A>that of the yard, so that they could not get away: and Telemachus said 
<A NAME="341"></A>to the other two, "I shall not let these women die a clean death, for they 
<A NAME="342"></A>were insolent to me and my mother, and used to sleep with the 
<A NAME="343"></A>suitors."
<A NAME="344"></A><BR><BR>So saying he made a ship's cable fast to one of the bearing-posts 
<A NAME="345"></A>that supported the roof of the domed room, and secured it all around the 
<A NAME="346"></A>building, at a good height, lest any of the women's feet should touch the 
<A NAME="347"></A>ground; and as thrushes or doves beat against a net that has been set for 
<A NAME="348"></A>them in a thicket just as they were getting to their nest, and a terrible 
<A NAME="349"></A>fate awaits them, even so did the women have to put their heads in nooses 
<A NAME="350"></A>one after the other and die most miserably. Their feet moved convulsively 
<A NAME="351"></A>for a while, but not for very long.
<A NAME="352"></A><BR><BR>As for Melanthius, they took him through the cloister into the 
<A NAME="353"></A>inner court. There they cut off his nose and his ears; they drew out his 
<A NAME="354"></A>vitals and gave them to the dogs raw, and then in their fury they cut off 
<A NAME="355"></A>his hands and his feet.
<A NAME="356"></A><BR><BR>When they had done this they washed their hands and feet and went 
<A NAME="357"></A>back into the house, for all was now over; and Ulysses said to the dear 
<A NAME="358"></A>old nurse Euryclea, "Bring me sulphur, which cleanses all pollution, and 
<A NAME="359"></A>fetch fire also that I may burn it, and purify the cloisters. Go, moreover, 
<A NAME="360"></A>and tell Penelope to come here with her attendants, and also all the maid 
<A NAME="361"></A>servants that are in the house."
<A NAME="362"></A><BR><BR>"All that you have said is true," answered Euryclea, "but let me 
<A NAME="363"></A>bring you some clean clothes- a shirt and cloak. Do not keep these rags 
<A NAME="364"></A>on your back any longer. It is not right."
<A NAME="365"></A><BR><BR>"First light me a fire," replied Ulysses.
<A NAME="366"></A><BR>She brought the fire and sulphur, as he had bidden her, and Ulysses 
<A NAME="367"></A>thoroughly purified the cloisters and both the inner and outer courts. 
<A NAME="368"></A>Then she went inside to call the women and tell them what had happened; 
<A NAME="369"></A>whereon they came from their apartment with torches in their hands, and 
<A NAME="370"></A>pressed round Ulysses to embrace him, kissing his head and shoulders and 
<A NAME="371"></A>taking hold of his hands. It made him feel as if he should like to weep, 
<A NAME="372"></A>for he remembered every one of them.
