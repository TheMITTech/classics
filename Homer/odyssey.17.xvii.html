<A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A>When the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, Telemachus bound 
<A NAME="11"></A>on his sandals and took a strong spear that suited his hands, for he wanted 
<A NAME="12"></A>to go into the city. "Old friend," said he to the swineherd, "I will now 
<A NAME="13"></A>go to the town and show myself to my mother, for she will never leave off 
<A NAME="14"></A>grieving till she has seen me. As for this unfortunate stranger, take him 
<A NAME="15"></A>to the town and let him beg there of any one who will give him a drink 
<A NAME="16"></A>and a piece of bread. I have trouble enough of my own, and cannot be burdened 
<A NAME="17"></A>with other people. If this makes him angry so much the worse for him, but 
<A NAME="18"></A>I like to say what I mean."
<A NAME="19"></A><BR><BR>Then Ulysses said, "Sir, I do not want to stay here; a beggar can 
<A NAME="20"></A>always do better in town than country, for any one who likes can give him 
<A NAME="21"></A>something. I am too old to care about remaining here at the beck and call 
<A NAME="22"></A>of a master. Therefore let this man do as you have just told him, and take 
<A NAME="23"></A>me to the town as soon as I have had a warm by the fire, and the day has 
<A NAME="24"></A>got a little heat in it. My clothes are wretchedly thin, and this frosty 
<A NAME="25"></A>morning I shall be perished with cold, for you say the city is some way 
<A NAME="26"></A>off."
<A NAME="27"></A><BR><BR>On this Telemachus strode off through the yards, brooding his revenge 
<A NAME="28"></A>upon the When he reached home he stood his spear against a bearing-post 
<A NAME="29"></A>of the cloister, crossed the stone floor of the cloister itself, and went 
<A NAME="30"></A>inside.
<A NAME="31"></A><BR><BR>Nurse Euryclea saw him long before any one else did. She was putting 
<A NAME="32"></A>the fleeces on to the seats, and she burst out crying as she ran up to 
<A NAME="33"></A>him; all the other maids came up too, and covered his head and shoulders 
<A NAME="34"></A>with their kisses. Penelope came out of her room looking like Diana or 
<A NAME="35"></A>Venus, and wept as she flung her arms about her son. She kissed his forehead 
<A NAME="36"></A>and both his beautiful eyes, "Light of my eyes," she cried as she spoke 
<A NAME="37"></A>fondly to him, "so you are come home again; I made sure I was never going 
<A NAME="38"></A>to see you any more. To think of your having gone off to Pylos without 
<A NAME="39"></A>saying anything about it or obtaining my consent. But come, tell me what 
<A NAME="40"></A>you saw."
<A NAME="41"></A><BR><BR>"Do not scold me, mother,' answered Telemachus, "nor vex me, seeing 
<A NAME="42"></A>what a narrow escape I have had, but wash your face, change your dress, 
<A NAME="43"></A>go upstairs with your maids, and promise full and sufficient hecatombs 
<A NAME="44"></A>to all the gods if Jove will only grant us our revenge upon the suitors. 
<A NAME="45"></A>I must now go to the place of assembly to invite a stranger who has come 
<A NAME="46"></A>back with me from Pylos. I sent him on with my crew, and told Piraeus to 
<A NAME="47"></A>take him home and look after him till I could come for him 
<A NAME="48"></A>myself."
<A NAME="49"></A><BR><BR>She heeded her son's words, washed her face, changed her dress, 
<A NAME="50"></A>and vowed full and sufficient hecatombs to all the gods if they would only 
<A NAME="51"></A>vouchsafe her revenge upon the suitors.
<A NAME="52"></A><BR><BR>Telemachus went through, and out of, the cloisters spear in hand- 
<A NAME="53"></A>not alone, for his two fleet dogs went with him. Minerva endowed him with 
<A NAME="54"></A>a presence of such divine comeliness that all marvelled at him as he went 
<A NAME="55"></A>by, and the suitors gathered round him with fair words in their mouths 
<A NAME="56"></A>and malice in their hearts; but he avoided them, and went to sit with Mentor, 
<A NAME="57"></A>Antiphus, and Halitherses, old friends of his father's house, and they 
<A NAME="58"></A>made him tell them all that had happened to him. Then Piraeus came up with 
<A NAME="59"></A>Theoclymenus, whom he had escorted through the town to the place of assembly, 
<A NAME="60"></A>whereon Telemachus at once joined them. Piraeus was first to speak: "Telemachus," 
<A NAME="61"></A>said he, "I wish you would send some of your women to my house to take 
<A NAME="62"></A>awa the presents Menelaus gave you."
<A NAME="63"></A><BR><BR>"We do not know, Piraeus," answered Telemachus, "what may happen. 
<A NAME="64"></A>If the suitors kill me in my own house and divide my property among them, 
<A NAME="65"></A>I would rather you had the presents than that any of those people should 
<A NAME="66"></A>get hold of them. If on the other hand I manage to kill them, I shall be 
<A NAME="67"></A>much obliged if you will kindly bring me my presents."
<A NAME="68"></A><BR><BR>With these words he took Theoclymenus to his own house. When they 
<A NAME="69"></A>got there they laid their cloaks on the benches and seats, went into the 
<A NAME="70"></A>baths, and washed themselves. When the maids had washed and anointed them, 
<A NAME="71"></A>and had given them cloaks and shirts, they took their seats at table. A 
<A NAME="72"></A>maid servant then brought them water in a beautiful golden ewer, and poured 
<A NAME="73"></A>it into a silver basin for them to wash their hands; and she drew a clean 
<A NAME="74"></A>table beside them. An upper servant brought them bread and offered them 
<A NAME="75"></A>many good things of what there was in the house. Opposite them sat Penelope, 
<A NAME="76"></A>reclining on a couch by one of the bearing-posts of the cloister, and spinning. 
<A NAME="77"></A>Then they laid their hands on the good things that were before them, and 
<A NAME="78"></A>as soon as they had had enough to eat and drink Penelope 
<A NAME="79"></A>said:
<A NAME="80"></A><BR><BR>"Telemachus, I shall go upstairs and lie down on that sad couch, 
<A NAME="81"></A>which I have not ceased to water with my tears, from the day Ulysses set 
<A NAME="82"></A>out for Troy with the sons of Atreus. You failed, however, to make it clear 
<A NAME="83"></A>to me before the suitors came back to the house, whether or no you had 
<A NAME="84"></A>been able to hear anything about the return of your 
<A NAME="85"></A>father."
<A NAME="86"></A><BR><BR>"I will tell you then truth," replied her son. "We went to Pylos 
<A NAME="87"></A>and saw Nestor, who took me to his house and treated me as hospitably as 
<A NAME="88"></A>though I were a son of his own who had just returned after a long absence; 
<A NAME="89"></A>so also did his sons; but he said he had not heard a word from any human 
<A NAME="90"></A>being about Ulysses, whether he was alive or dead. He sent me, therefore, 
<A NAME="91"></A>with a chariot and horses to Menelaus. There I saw Helen, for whose sake 
<A NAME="92"></A>so many, both Argives and Trojans, were in heaven's wisdom doomed to suffer. 
<A NAME="93"></A>Menelaus asked me what it was that had brought me to Lacedaemon, and I 
<A NAME="94"></A>told him the whole truth, whereon he said, 'So, then, these cowards would 
<A NAME="95"></A>usurp a brave man's bed? A hind might as well lay her new-born young in 
<A NAME="96"></A>the lair of a lion, and then go off to feed in the forest or in some grassy 
<A NAME="97"></A>dell. The lion, when he comes back to his lair, will make short work with 
<A NAME="98"></A>the pair of them, and so will Ulysses with these suitors. By father Jove, 
<A NAME="99"></A>Minerva, and Apollo, if Ulysses is still the man that he was when he wrestled 
<A NAME="100"></A>with Philomeleides in Lesbos, and threw him so heavily that all the Greeks 
<A NAME="101"></A>cheered him- if he is still such, and were to come near these suitors, 
<A NAME="102"></A>they would have a short shrift and a sorry wedding. As regards your question, 
<A NAME="103"></A>however, I will not prevaricate nor deceive you, but what the old man of 
<A NAME="104"></A>the sea told me, so much will I tell you in full. He said he could see 
<A NAME="105"></A>Ulysses on an island sorrowing bitterly in the house of the nymph Calypso, 
<A NAME="106"></A>who was keeping him prisoner, and he could not reach his home, for he had 
<A NAME="107"></A>no ships nor sailors to take him over the sea.' This was what Menelaus 
<A NAME="108"></A>told me, and when I had heard his story I came away; the gods then gave 
<A NAME="109"></A>me a fair wind and soon brought me safe home again."
<A NAME="110"></A><BR><BR>With these words he moved the heart of Penelope. Then Theoclymenus 
<A NAME="111"></A>said to her:
<A NAME="112"></A><BR><BR>"Madam, wife of Ulysses, Telemachus does not understand these things; 
<A NAME="113"></A>listen therefore to me, for I can divine them surely, and will hide nothing 
<A NAME="114"></A>from you. May Jove the king of heaven be my witness, and the rites of hospitality, 
<A NAME="115"></A>with that hearth of Ulysses to which I now come, that Ulysses himself is 
<A NAME="116"></A>even now in Ithaca, and, either going about the country or staying in one 
<A NAME="117"></A>place, is enquiring into all these evil deeds and preparing a day of reckoning 
<A NAME="118"></A>for the suitors. I saw an omen when I was on the ship which meant this, 
<A NAME="119"></A>and I told Telemachus about it."
<A NAME="120"></A><BR><BR>"May it be even so," answered Penelope; "if your words come true, 
<A NAME="121"></A>you shall have such gifts and such good will from me that all who see you 
<A NAME="122"></A>shall congratulate you."
<A NAME="123"></A><BR><BR>Thus did they converse. Meanwhile the suitors were throwing discs, 
<A NAME="124"></A>or aiming with spears at a mark on the levelled ground in front of the 
<A NAME="125"></A>house, and behaving with all their old insolence. But when it was now time 
<A NAME="126"></A>for dinner, and the flock of sheep and goats had come into the town from 
<A NAME="127"></A>all the country round, with their shepherds as usual, then Medon, who was 
<A NAME="128"></A>their favourite servant, and who waited upon them at table, said, "Now 
<A NAME="129"></A>then, my young masters, you have had enough sport, so come inside that 
<A NAME="130"></A>we may get dinner ready. Dinner is not a bad thing, at dinner 
<A NAME="131"></A>time."
<A NAME="132"></A><BR><BR>They left their sports as he told them, and when they were within 
<A NAME="133"></A>the house, they laid their cloaks on the benches and seats inside, and 
<A NAME="134"></A>then sacrificed some sheep, goats, pigs, and a heifer, all of them fat 
<A NAME="135"></A>and well grown. Thus they made ready for their meal. In the meantime Ulysses 
<A NAME="136"></A>and the swineherd were about starting for the town, and the swineherd said, 
<A NAME="137"></A>"Stranger, I suppose you still want to go to town to-day, as my master 
<A NAME="138"></A>said you were to do; for my own part I should have liked you to stay here 
<A NAME="139"></A>as a station hand, but I must do as my master tells me, or he will scold 
<A NAME="140"></A>me later on, and a scolding from one's master is a very serious thing. 
<A NAME="141"></A>Let us then be off, for it is now broad day; it will be night again directly 
<A NAME="142"></A>and then you will find it colder."
<A NAME="143"></A><BR><BR>"I know, and understand you," replied Ulysses; "you need say no 
<A NAME="144"></A>more. Let us be going, but if you have a stick ready cut, let me have it 
<A NAME="145"></A>to walk with, for you say the road is a very rough one."
<A NAME="146"></A><BR><BR>As he spoke he threw his shabby old tattered wallet over his shoulders, 
<A NAME="147"></A>by the cord from which it hung, and Eumaeus gave him a stick to his liking. 
<A NAME="148"></A>The two then started, leaving the station in charge of the dogs and herdsmen 
<A NAME="149"></A>who remained behind; the swineherd led the way and his master followed 
<A NAME="150"></A>after, looking like some broken-down old tramp as he leaned upon his staff, 
<A NAME="151"></A>and his clothes were all in rags. When they had got over the rough steep 
<A NAME="152"></A>ground and were nearing the city, they reached the fountain from which 
<A NAME="153"></A>the citizens drew their water. This had been made by Ithacus, Neritus, 
<A NAME="154"></A>and Polyctor. There was a grove of water-loving poplars planted in a circle 
<A NAME="155"></A>all round it, and the clear cold water came down to it from a rock high 
<A NAME="156"></A>up, while above the fountain there was an altar to the nymphs, at which 
<A NAME="157"></A>all wayfarers used to sacrifice. Here Melanthius son of Dolius overtook 
<A NAME="158"></A>them as he was driving down some goats, the best in his flock, for the 
<A NAME="159"></A>suitors' dinner, and there were two shepherds with him. When he saw Eumaeus 
<A NAME="160"></A>and Ulysses he reviled them with outrageous and unseemly language, which 
<A NAME="161"></A>made Ulysses very angry.
<A NAME="162"></A><BR><BR>"There you go," cried he, "and a precious pair you are. See how 
<A NAME="163"></A>heaven brings birds of the same feather to one another. Where, pray, master 
<A NAME="164"></A>swineherd, are you taking this poor miserable object? It would make any 
<A NAME="165"></A>one sick to see such a creature at table. A fellow like this never won 
<A NAME="166"></A>a prize for anything in his life, but will go about rubbing his shoulders 
<A NAME="167"></A>against every man's door post, and begging, not for swords and cauldrons 
<A NAME="168"></A>like a man, but only for a few scraps not worth begging for. If you would 
<A NAME="169"></A>give him to me for a hand on my station, he might do to clean out the folds, 
<A NAME="170"></A>or bring a bit of sweet feed to the kids, and he could fatten his thighs 
<A NAME="171"></A>as much as he pleased on whey; but he has taken to bad ways and will not 
<A NAME="172"></A>go about any kind of work; he will do nothing but beg victuals all the 
<A NAME="173"></A>town over, to feed his insatiable belly. I say, therefore and it shall 
<A NAME="174"></A>surely be- if he goes near Ulysses' house he will get his head broken by 
<A NAME="175"></A>the stools they will fling at him, till they turn him 
<A NAME="176"></A>out."
<A NAME="177"></A><BR><BR>On this, as he passed, he gave Ulysses a kick on the hip out of 
<A NAME="178"></A>pure wantonness, but Ulysses stood firm, and did not budge from the path. 
<A NAME="179"></A>For a moment he doubted whether or no to fly at Melanthius and kill him 
<A NAME="180"></A>with his staff, or fling him to the ground and beat his brains out; he 
<A NAME="181"></A>resolved, however, to endure it and keep himself in check, but the swineherd 
<A NAME="182"></A>looked straight at Melanthius and rebuked him, lifting up his hands and 
<A NAME="183"></A>praying to heaven as he did so.
<A NAME="184"></A><BR><BR>"Fountain nymphs," he cried, "children of Jove, if ever Ulysses 
<A NAME="185"></A>burned you thigh bones covered with fat whether of lambs or kids, grant 
<A NAME="186"></A>my prayer that heaven may send him home. He would soon put an end to the 
<A NAME="187"></A>swaggering threats with which such men as you go about insulting people-gadding 
<A NAME="188"></A>all over the town while your flocks are going to ruin through bad 
<A NAME="189"></A>shepherding."
<A NAME="190"></A><BR><BR>Then Melanthius the goatherd answered, "You ill-conditioned cur, 
<A NAME="191"></A>what are you talking about? Some day or other I will put you on board ship 
<A NAME="192"></A>and take you to a foreign country, where I can sell you and pocket the 
<A NAME="193"></A>money you will fetch. I wish I were as sure that Apollo would strike Telemachus 
<A NAME="194"></A>dead this very day, or that the suitors would kill him, as I am that Ulysses 
<A NAME="195"></A>will never come home again."
<A NAME="196"></A><BR><BR>With this he left them to come on at their leisure, while he went 
<A NAME="197"></A>quickly forward and soon reached the house of his master. When he got there 
<A NAME="198"></A>he went in and took his seat among the suitors opposite Eurymachus, who 
<A NAME="199"></A>liked him better than any of the others. The servants brought him a portion 
<A NAME="200"></A>of meat, and an upper woman servant set bread before him that he might 
<A NAME="201"></A>eat. Presently Ulysses and the swineherd came up to the house and stood 
<A NAME="202"></A>by it, amid a sound of music, for Phemius was just beginning to sing to 
<A NAME="203"></A>the suitors. Then Ulysses took hold of the swineherd's hand, and 
<A NAME="204"></A>said:
<A NAME="205"></A><BR><BR>"Eumaeus, this house of Ulysses is a very fine place. No matter 
<A NAME="206"></A>how far you go you will find few like it. One building keeps following 
<A NAME="207"></A>on after another. The outer court has a wall with battlements all round 
<A NAME="208"></A>it; the doors are double folding, and of good workmanship; it would be 
<A NAME="209"></A>a hard matter to take it by force of arms. I perceive, too, that there 
<A NAME="210"></A>are many people banqueting within it, for there is a smell of roast meat, 
<A NAME="211"></A>and I hear a sound of music, which the gods have made to go along with 
<A NAME="212"></A>feasting."
<A NAME="213"></A><BR><BR>Then Eumaeus said, "You have perceived aright, as indeed you generally 
<A NAME="214"></A>do; but let us think what will be our best course. Will you go inside first 
<A NAME="215"></A>and join the suitors, leaving me here behind you, or will you wait here 
<A NAME="216"></A>and let me go in first? But do not wait long, or some one may you loitering 
<A NAME="217"></A>about outside, and throw something at you. Consider this matter I pray 
<A NAME="218"></A>you."
<A NAME="219"></A><BR><BR>And Ulysses answered, "I understand and heed. Go in first and leave 
<A NAME="220"></A>me here where I am. I am quite used to being beaten and having things thrown 
<A NAME="221"></A>at me. I have been so much buffeted about in war and by sea that I am case-hardened, 
<A NAME="222"></A>and this too may go with the rest. But a man cannot hide away the cravings 
<A NAME="223"></A>of a hungry belly; this is an enemy which gives much trouble to all men; 
<A NAME="224"></A>it is because of this that ships are fitted out to sail the seas, and to 
<A NAME="225"></A>make war upon other people."
<A NAME="226"></A><BR><BR>As they were thus talking, a dog that had been lying asleep raised 
<A NAME="227"></A>his head and pricked up his ears. This was Argos, whom Ulysses had bred 
<A NAME="228"></A>before setting out for Troy, but he had never had any work out of him. 
<A NAME="229"></A>In the old days he used to be taken out by the young men when they went 
<A NAME="230"></A>hunting wild goats, or deer, or hares, but now that his master was gone 
<A NAME="231"></A>he was lying neglected on the heaps of mule and cow dung that lay in front 
<A NAME="232"></A>of the stable doors till the men should come and draw it away to manure 
<A NAME="233"></A>the great close; and he was full of fleas. As soon as he saw Ulysses standing 
<A NAME="234"></A>there, he dropped his ears and wagged his tail, but he could not get close 
<A NAME="235"></A>up to his master. When Ulysses saw the dog on the other side of the yard, 
<A NAME="236"></A>dashed a tear from his eyes without Eumaeus seeing it, and 
<A NAME="237"></A>said:
<A NAME="238"></A><BR><BR>"Eumaeus, what a noble hound that is over yonder on the manure 
<A NAME="239"></A>heap: his build is splendid; is he as fine a fellow as he looks, or is 
<A NAME="240"></A>he only one of those dogs that come begging about a table, and are kept 
<A NAME="241"></A>merely for show?"
<A NAME="242"></A><BR><BR>"This hound," answered Eumaeus, "belonged to him who has died in 
<A NAME="243"></A>a far country. If he were what he was when Ulysses left for Troy, he would 
<A NAME="244"></A>soon show you what he could do. There was not a wild beast in the forest 
<A NAME="245"></A>that could get away from him when he was once on its tracks. But now he 
<A NAME="246"></A>has fallen on evil times, for his master is dead and gone, and the women 
<A NAME="247"></A>take no care of him. Servants never do their work when their master's hand 
<A NAME="248"></A>is no longer over them, for Jove takes half the goodness out of a man when 
<A NAME="249"></A>he makes a slave of him."
<A NAME="250"></A><BR><BR>As he spoke he went inside the buildings to the cloister where 
<A NAME="251"></A>the suitors were, but Argos died as soon as he had recognized his 
<A NAME="252"></A>master.
<A NAME="253"></A><BR><BR>Telemachus saw Eumaeus long before any one else did, and beckoned 
<A NAME="254"></A>him to come and sit beside him; so he looked about and saw a seat lying 
<A NAME="255"></A>near where the carver sat serving out their portions to the suitors; he 
<A NAME="256"></A>picked it up, brought it to Telemachus's table, and sat down opposite him. 
<A NAME="257"></A>Then the servant brought him his portion, and gave him bread from the 
<A NAME="258"></A>bread-basket.
<A NAME="259"></A><BR><BR>Immediately afterwards Ulysses came inside, looking like a poor 
<A NAME="260"></A>miserable old beggar, leaning on his staff and with his clothes all in 
<A NAME="261"></A>rags. He sat down upon the threshold of ash-wood just inside the doors 
<A NAME="262"></A>leading from the outer to the inner court, and against a bearing-post of 
<A NAME="263"></A>cypress-wood which the carpenter had skillfully planed, and had made to 
<A NAME="264"></A>join truly with rule and line. Telemachus took a whole loaf from the bread-basket, 
<A NAME="265"></A>with as much meat as he could hold in his two hands, and said to Eumaeus, 
<A NAME="266"></A>"Take this to the stranger, and tell him to go the round of the suitors, 
<A NAME="267"></A>and beg from them; a beggar must not be shamefaced."
<A NAME="268"></A><BR><BR>So Eumaeus went up to him and said, "Stranger, Telemachus sends 
<A NAME="269"></A>you this, and says you are to go the round of the suitors begging, for 
<A NAME="270"></A>beggars must not be shamefaced."
<A NAME="271"></A><BR><BR>Ulysses answered, "May King Jove grant all happiness to Telemachus, 
<A NAME="272"></A>and fulfil the desire of his heart."
<A NAME="273"></A><BR><BR>Then with both hands he took what Telemachus had sent him, and 
<A NAME="274"></A>laid it on the dirty old wallet at his feet. He went on eating it while 
<A NAME="275"></A>the bard was singing, and had just finished his dinner as he left off. 
<A NAME="276"></A>The suitors applauded the bard, whereon Minerva went up to Ulysses and 
<A NAME="277"></A>prompted him to beg pieces of bread from each one of the suitors, that 
<A NAME="278"></A>he might see what kind of people they were, and tell the good from the 
<A NAME="279"></A>bad; but come what might she was not going to save a single one of them. 
<A NAME="280"></A>Ulysses, therefore, went on his round, going from left to right, and stretched 
<A NAME="281"></A>out his hands to beg as though he were a real beggar. Some of them pitied 
<A NAME="282"></A>him, and were curious about him, asking one another who he was and where 
<A NAME="283"></A>he came from; whereon the goatherd Melanthius said, "Suitors of my noble 
<A NAME="284"></A>mistress, I can tell you something about him, for I have seen him before. 
<A NAME="285"></A>The swineherd brought him here, but I know nothing about the man himself, 
<A NAME="286"></A>nor where he comes from."
<A NAME="287"></A><BR><BR>On this Antinous began to abuse the swineherd. "You precious idiot," 
<A NAME="288"></A>he cried, "what have you brought this man to town for? Have we not tramps 
<A NAME="289"></A>and beggars enough already to pester us as we sit at meat? Do you think 
<A NAME="290"></A>it a small thing that such people gather here to waste your master's property 
<A NAME="291"></A>and must you needs bring this man as well?"
<A NAME="292"></A><BR><BR>And Eumaeus answered, "Antinous, your birth is good but your words 
<A NAME="293"></A>evil. It was no doing of mine that he came here. Who is likely to invite 
<A NAME="294"></A>a stranger from a foreign country, unless it be one of those who can do 
<A NAME="295"></A>public service as a seer, a healer of hurts, a carpenter, or a bard who 
<A NAME="296"></A>can charm us with his Such men are welcome all the world over, but no one 
<A NAME="297"></A>is likely to ask a beggar who will only worry him. You are always harder 
<A NAME="298"></A>on Ulysses' servants than any of the other suitors are, and above all on 
<A NAME="299"></A>me, but I do not care so long as Telemachus and Penelope are alive and 
<A NAME="300"></A>here."
<A NAME="301"></A><BR><BR>But Telemachus said, "Hush, do not answer him; Antinous has the 
<A NAME="302"></A>bitterest tongue of all the suitors, and he makes the others 
<A NAME="303"></A>worse."
<A NAME="304"></A><BR><BR>Then turning to Antinous he said, "Antinous, you take as much care 
<A NAME="305"></A>of my interests as though I were your son. Why should you want to see this 
<A NAME="306"></A>stranger turned out of the house? Heaven forbid; take' something and give 
<A NAME="307"></A>it him yourself; I do not grudge it; I bid you take it. Never mind my mother, 
<A NAME="308"></A>nor any of the other servants in the house; but I know you will not do 
<A NAME="309"></A>what I say, for you are more fond of eating things yourself than of giving 
<A NAME="310"></A>them to other people."
<A NAME="311"></A><BR><BR>"What do you mean, Telemachus," replied Antinous, "by this swaggering 
<A NAME="312"></A>talk? If all the suitors were to give him as much as I will, he would not 
<A NAME="313"></A>come here again for another three months."
<A NAME="314"></A><BR><BR>As he spoke he drew the stool on which he rested his dainty feet 
<A NAME="315"></A>from under the table, and made as though he would throw it at Ulysses, 
<A NAME="316"></A>but the other suitors all gave him something, and filled his wallet with 
<A NAME="317"></A>bread and meat; he was about, therefore, to go back to the threshold and 
<A NAME="318"></A>eat what the suitors had given him, but he first went up to Antinous and 
<A NAME="319"></A>said:
<A NAME="320"></A><BR><BR>"Sir, give me something; you are not, surely, the poorest man here; 
<A NAME="321"></A>you seem to be a chief, foremost among them all; therefore you should be 
<A NAME="322"></A>the better giver, and I will tell far and wide of your bounty. I too was 
<A NAME="323"></A>a rich man once, and had a fine house of my own; in those days I gave to 
<A NAME="324"></A>many a tramp such as I now am, no matter who he might be nor what he wanted. 
<A NAME="325"></A>I had any number of servants, and all the other things which people have 
<A NAME="326"></A>who live well and are accounted wealthy, but it pleased Jove to take all 
<A NAME="327"></A>away from me. He sent me with a band of roving robbers to Egypt; it was 
<A NAME="328"></A>a long voyage and I was undone by it. I stationed my bade ships in the 
<A NAME="329"></A>river Aegyptus, and bade my men stay by them and keep guard over them, 
<A NAME="330"></A>while sent out scouts to reconnoitre from every point of 
<A NAME="331"></A>vantage.
<A NAME="332"></A><BR><BR>"But the men disobeyed my orders, took to their own devices, and 
<A NAME="333"></A>ravaged the land of the Egyptians, killing the men, and taking their wives 
<A NAME="334"></A>and children captives. The alarm was soon carried to the city, and when 
<A NAME="335"></A>they heard the war-cry, the people came out at daybreak till the plain 
<A NAME="336"></A>was filled with soldiers horse and foot, and with the gleam of armour. 
<A NAME="337"></A>Then Jove spread panic among my men, and they would no longer face the 
<A NAME="338"></A>enemy, for they found themselves surrounded. The Egyptians killed many 
<A NAME="339"></A>of us, and took the rest alive to do forced labour for them; as for myself, 
<A NAME="340"></A>they gave me to a friend who met them, to take to Cyprus, Dmetor by name, 
<A NAME="341"></A>son of Iasus, who was a great man in Cyprus. Thence I am come hither in 
<A NAME="342"></A>a state of great misery."
<A NAME="343"></A><BR><BR>Then Antinous said, "What god can have sent such a pestilence to 
<A NAME="344"></A>plague us during our dinner? Get out, into the open part of the court, 
<A NAME="345"></A>or I will give you Egypt and Cyprus over again for your insolence and importunity; 
<A NAME="346"></A>you have begged of all the others, and they have given you lavishly, for 
<A NAME="347"></A>they have abundance round them, and it is easy to be free with other people's 
<A NAME="348"></A>property when there is plenty of it."
<A NAME="349"></A><BR><BR>On this Ulysses began to move off, and said, "Your looks, my fine 
<A NAME="350"></A>sir, are better than your breeding; if you were in your own house you would 
<A NAME="351"></A>not spare a poor man so much as a pinch of salt, for though you are in 
<A NAME="352"></A>another man's, and surrounded with abundance, you cannot find it in you 
<A NAME="353"></A>to give him even a piece of bread."
<A NAME="354"></A><BR><BR>This made Antinous very angry, and he scowled at him saying, "You 
<A NAME="355"></A>shall pay for this before you get clear of the court." With these words 
<A NAME="356"></A>he threw a footstool at him, and hit him on the right shoulder-blade near 
<A NAME="357"></A>the top of his back. Ulysses stood firm as a rock and the blow did not 
<A NAME="358"></A>even stagger him, but he shook his head in silence as he brooded on his 
<A NAME="359"></A>revenge. Then he went back to the threshold and sat down there, laying 
<A NAME="360"></A>his well-filled wallet at his feet.
<A NAME="361"></A><BR><BR>"Listen to me," he cried, "you suitors of Queen Penelope, that 
<A NAME="362"></A>I may speak even as I am minded. A man knows neither ache nor pain if he 
<A NAME="363"></A>gets hit while fighting for his money, or for his sheep or his cattle; 
<A NAME="364"></A>and even so Antinous has hit me while in the service of my miserable belly, 
<A NAME="365"></A>which is always getting people into trouble. Still, if the poor have gods 
<A NAME="366"></A>and avenging deities at all, I pray them that Antinous may come to a bad 
<A NAME="367"></A>end before his marriage."
<A NAME="368"></A><BR><BR>"Sit where you are, and eat your victuals in silence, or be off 
<A NAME="369"></A>elsewhere," shouted Antinous. "If you say more I will have you dragged 
<A NAME="370"></A>hand and foot through the courts, and the servants shall flay you 
<A NAME="371"></A>alive."
<A NAME="372"></A><BR><BR>The other suitors were much displeased at this, and one of the 
<A NAME="373"></A>young men said, "Antinous, you did ill in striking that poor wretch of 
<A NAME="374"></A>a tramp: it will be worse for you if he should turn out to be some god- 
<A NAME="375"></A>and we know the gods go about disguised in all sorts of ways as people 
<A NAME="376"></A>from foreign countries, and travel about the world to see who do amiss 
<A NAME="377"></A>and who righteously."
<A NAME="378"></A><BR><BR>Thus said the suitors, but Antinous paid them no heed. Meanwhile 
<A NAME="379"></A>Telemachus was furious about the blow that had been given to his father, 
<A NAME="380"></A>and though no tear fell from him, he shook his head in silence and brooded 
<A NAME="381"></A>on his revenge.
<A NAME="382"></A><BR><BR>Now when Penelope heard that the beggar had been struck in the 
<A NAME="383"></A>banqueting-cloister, she said before her maids, "Would that Apollo would 
<A NAME="384"></A>so strike you, Antinous," and her waiting woman Eurynome answered, "If 
<A NAME="385"></A>our prayers were answered not one of the suitors would ever again see the 
<A NAME="386"></A>sun rise." Then Penelope said, "Nurse, I hate every single one of them, 
<A NAME="387"></A>for they mean nothing but mischief, but I hate Antinous like the darkness 
<A NAME="388"></A>of death itself. A poor unfortunate tramp has come begging about the house 
<A NAME="389"></A>for sheer want. Every one else has given him something to put in his wallet, 
<A NAME="390"></A>but Antinous has hit him on the right shoulder-blade with a 
<A NAME="391"></A>footstool."
<A NAME="392"></A><BR><BR>Thus did she talk with her maids as she sat in her own room, and 
<A NAME="393"></A>in the meantime Ulysses was getting his dinner. Then she called for the 
<A NAME="394"></A>swineherd and said, "Eumaeus, go and tell the stranger to come here, I 
<A NAME="395"></A>want to see him and ask him some questions. He seems to have travelled 
<A NAME="396"></A>much, and he may have seen or heard something of my unhappy 
<A NAME="397"></A>husband."
<A NAME="398"></A><BR><BR>To this you answered, O swineherd Eumaeus, "If these Achaeans, 
<A NAME="399"></A>Madam, would only keep quiet, you would be charmed with the history of 
<A NAME="400"></A>his adventures. I had him three days and three nights with me in my hut, 
<A NAME="401"></A>which was the first place he reached after running away from his ship, 
<A NAME="402"></A>and he has not yet completed the story of his misfortunes. If he had been 
<A NAME="403"></A>the most heaven-taught minstrel in the whole world, on whose lips all hearers 
<A NAME="404"></A>hang entranced, I could not have been more charmed as I sat in my hut and 
<A NAME="405"></A>listened to him. He says there is an old friendship between his house and 
<A NAME="406"></A>that of Ulysses, and that he comes from Crete where the descendants of 
<A NAME="407"></A>Minos live, after having been driven hither and thither by every kind of 
<A NAME="408"></A>misfortune; he also declares that he has heard of Ulysses as being alive 
<A NAME="409"></A>and near at hand among the Thesprotians, and that he is bringing great 
<A NAME="410"></A>wealth home with him."
<A NAME="411"></A><BR><BR>"Call him here, then," said Penelope, "that I too may hear his 
<A NAME="412"></A>story. As for the suitors, let them take their pleasure indoors or out 
<A NAME="413"></A>as they will, for they have nothing to fret about. Their corn and wine 
<A NAME="414"></A>remain unwasted in their houses with none but servants to consume them, 
<A NAME="415"></A>while they keep hanging about our house day after day sacrificing our oxen, 
<A NAME="416"></A>sheep, and fat goats for their banquets, and never giving so much as a 
<A NAME="417"></A>thought to the quantity of wine they drink. No estate can stand such recklessness, 
<A NAME="418"></A>for we have now no Ulysses to protect us. If he were to come again, he 
<A NAME="419"></A>and his son would soon have their revenge."
<A NAME="420"></A><BR><BR>As she spoke Telemachus sneezed so loudly that the whole house 
<A NAME="421"></A>resounded with it. Penelope laughed when she heard this, and said to Eumaeus, 
<A NAME="422"></A>"Go and call the stranger; did you not hear how my son sneezed just as 
<A NAME="423"></A>I was speaking? This can only mean that all the suitors are going to be 
<A NAME="424"></A>killed, and that not one of them shall escape. Furthermore I say, and lay 
<A NAME="425"></A>my saying to your heart: if I am satisfied that the stranger is speaking 
<A NAME="426"></A>the truth I shall give him a shirt and cloak of good 
<A NAME="427"></A>wear."
<A NAME="428"></A><BR><BR>When Eumaeus heard this he went straight to Ulysses and said, "Father 
<A NAME="429"></A>stranger, my mistress Penelope, mother of Telemachus, has sent for you; 
<A NAME="430"></A>she is in great grief, but she wishes to hear anything you can tell her 
<A NAME="431"></A>about her husband, and if she is satisfied that you are speaking the truth, 
<A NAME="432"></A>she will give you a shirt and cloak, which are the very things that you 
<A NAME="433"></A>are most in want of. As for bread, you can get enough of that to fill your 
<A NAME="434"></A>belly, by begging about the town, and letting those give that 
<A NAME="435"></A>will."
<A NAME="436"></A><BR><BR>"I will tell Penelope," answered Ulysses, "nothing but what is 
<A NAME="437"></A>strictly true. I know all about her husband, and have been partner with 
<A NAME="438"></A>him in affliction, but I am afraid of passing. through this crowd of cruel 
<A NAME="439"></A>suitors, for their pride and insolence reach heaven. Just now, moreover, 
<A NAME="440"></A>as I was going about the house without doing any harm, a man gave me a 
<A NAME="441"></A>blow that hurt me very much, but neither Telemachus nor any one else defended 
<A NAME="442"></A>me. Tell Penelope, therefore, to be patient and wait till sundown. Let 
<A NAME="443"></A>her give me a seat close up to the fire, for my clothes are worn very thin- 
<A NAME="444"></A>you know they are, for you have seen them ever since I first asked you 
<A NAME="445"></A>to help me- she can then ask me about the return of her 
<A NAME="446"></A>husband."
<A NAME="447"></A><BR><BR>The swineherd went back when he heard this, and Penelope said as 
<A NAME="448"></A>she saw him cross the threshold, "Why do you not bring him here, Eumaeus? 
<A NAME="449"></A>Is he afraid that some one will ill-treat him, or is he shy of coming inside 
<A NAME="450"></A>the house at all? Beggars should not be shamefaced."
<A NAME="451"></A><BR><BR>To this you answered, O swineherd Eumaeus, "The stranger is quite 
<A NAME="452"></A>reasonable. He is avoiding the suitors, and is only doing what any one 
<A NAME="453"></A>else would do. He asks you to wait till sundown, and it will be much better, 
<A NAME="454"></A>madam, that you should have him all to yourself, when you can hear him 
<A NAME="455"></A>and talk to him as you will."
<A NAME="456"></A><BR><BR>"The man is no fool," answered Penelope, "it would very likely 
<A NAME="457"></A>be as he says, for there are no such abominable people in the whole world 
<A NAME="458"></A>as these men are."
<A NAME="459"></A><BR><BR>When she had done speaking Eumaeus went back to the suitors, for 
<A NAME="460"></A>he had explained everything. Then he went up to Telemachus and said in 
<A NAME="461"></A>his ear so that none could overhear him, "My dear sir, I will now go back 
<A NAME="462"></A>to the pigs, to see after your property and my own business. You will look 
<A NAME="463"></A>to what is going on here, but above all be careful to keep out of danger, 
<A NAME="464"></A>for there are many who bear you ill will. May Jove bring them to a bad 
<A NAME="465"></A>end before they do us a mischief."
<A NAME="466"></A><BR><BR>"Very well," replied Telemachus, "go home when you have had your 
<A NAME="467"></A>dinner, and in the morning come here with the victims we are to sacrifice 
<A NAME="468"></A>for the day. Leave the rest to heaven and me."
<A NAME="469"></A><BR><BR>On this Eumaeus took his seat again, and when he had finished his 
<A NAME="470"></A>dinner he left the courts and the cloister with the men at table, and went 
<A NAME="471"></A>back to his pigs. As for the suitors, they presently began to amuse themselves 
<A NAME="472"></A>with singing and dancing, for it was now getting on towards 
<A NAME="473"></A>evening.
