<A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A>Euryclea now went upstairs laughing to tell her mistress that her dear 
<A NAME="11"></A>husband had come home. Her aged knees became young again and her feet were 
<A NAME="12"></A>nimble for joy as she went up to her mistress and bent over her head to 
<A NAME="13"></A>speak to her. "Wake up Penelope, my dear child," she exclaimed, "and see 
<A NAME="14"></A>with your own eyes something that you have been wanting this long time 
<A NAME="15"></A>past. Ulysses has at last indeed come home again, and has killed the suitors 
<A NAME="16"></A>who were giving so much trouble in his house, eating up his estate and 
<A NAME="17"></A>ill-treating his son."
<A NAME="18"></A><BR><BR>"My good nurse," answered Penelope, "you must be mad. The gods 
<A NAME="19"></A>sometimes send some very sensible people out of their minds, and make foolish 
<A NAME="20"></A>people become sensible. This is what they must have been doing to you; 
<A NAME="21"></A>for you always used to be a reasonable person. Why should you thus mock 
<A NAME="22"></A>me when I have trouble enough already- talking such nonsense, and waking 
<A NAME="23"></A>me up out of a sweet sleep that had taken possession of my eyes and closed 
<A NAME="24"></A>them? I have never slept so soundly from the day my poor husband went to 
<A NAME="25"></A>that city with the ill-omened name. Go back again into the women's room; 
<A NAME="26"></A>if it had been any one else, who had woke me up to bring me such absurd 
<A NAME="27"></A>news I should have sent her away with a severe scolding. As it is, your 
<A NAME="28"></A>age shall protect you."
<A NAME="29"></A><BR><BR>"My dear child," answered Euryclea, "I am not mocking you. It is 
<A NAME="30"></A>quite true as I tell you that Ulysses is come home again. He was the stranger 
<A NAME="31"></A>whom they all kept on treating so badly in the cloister. Telemachus knew 
<A NAME="32"></A>all the time that he was come back, but kept his father's secret that he 
<A NAME="33"></A>might have his revenge on all these wicked people.
<A NAME="34"></A><BR><BR>Then Penelope sprang up from her couch, threw her arms round Euryclea, 
<A NAME="35"></A>and wept for joy. "But my dear nurse," said she, "explain this to me; if 
<A NAME="36"></A>he has really come home as you say, how did he manage to overcome the wicked 
<A NAME="37"></A>suitors single handed, seeing what a number of them there always 
<A NAME="38"></A>were?"
<A NAME="39"></A><BR><BR>"I was not there," answered Euryclea, "and do not know; I only 
<A NAME="40"></A>heard them groaning while they were being killed. We sat crouching and 
<A NAME="41"></A>huddled up in a corner of the women's room with the doors closed, till 
<A NAME="42"></A>your son came to fetch me because his father sent him. Then I found Ulysses 
<A NAME="43"></A>standing over the corpses that were lying on the ground all round him, 
<A NAME="44"></A>one on top of the other. You would have enjoyed it if you could have seen 
<A NAME="45"></A>him standing there all bespattered with blood and filth, and looking just 
<A NAME="46"></A>like a lion. But the corpses are now all piled up in the gatehouse that 
<A NAME="47"></A>is in the outer court, and Ulysses has lit a great fire to purify the house 
<A NAME="48"></A>with sulphur. He has sent me to call you, so come with me that you may 
<A NAME="49"></A>both be happy together after all; for now at last the desire of your heart 
<A NAME="50"></A>has been fulfilled; your husband is come home to find both wife and son 
<A NAME="51"></A>alive and well, and to take his revenge in his own house on the suitors 
<A NAME="52"></A>who behaved so badly to him."
<A NAME="53"></A><BR><BR>"'My dear nurse," said Penelope, "do not exult too confidently 
<A NAME="54"></A>over all this. You know how delighted every one would be to see Ulysses 
<A NAME="55"></A>come home- more particularly myself, and the son who has been born to both 
<A NAME="56"></A>of us; but what you tell me cannot be really true. It is some god who is 
<A NAME="57"></A>angry with the suitors for their great wickedness, and has made an end 
<A NAME="58"></A>of them; for they respected no man in the whole world, neither rich nor 
<A NAME="59"></A>poor, who came near them, who came near them, and they have come to a bad 
<A NAME="60"></A>end in consequence of their iniquity. Ulysses is dead far away from the 
<A NAME="61"></A>Achaean land; he will never return home again."
<A NAME="62"></A><BR><BR>Then nurse Euryclea said, "My child, what are you talking about? 
<A NAME="63"></A>but you were all hard of belief and have made up your mind that your husband 
<A NAME="64"></A>is never coming, although he is in the house and by his own fire side at 
<A NAME="65"></A>this very moment. Besides I can give you another proof; when I was washing 
<A NAME="66"></A>him I perceived the scar which the wild boar gave him, and I wanted to 
<A NAME="67"></A>tell you about it, but in his wisdom he would not let me, and clapped his 
<A NAME="68"></A>hands over my mouth; so come with me and I will make this bargain with 
<A NAME="69"></A>you- if I am deceiving you, you may have me killed by the most cruel death 
<A NAME="70"></A>you can think of."
<A NAME="71"></A><BR><BR>"My dear nurse," said Penelope, "however wise you may be you can 
<A NAME="72"></A>hardly fathom the counsels of the gods. Nevertheless, we will go in search 
<A NAME="73"></A>of my son, that I may see the corpses of the suitors, and the man who has 
<A NAME="74"></A>killed them."
<A NAME="75"></A><BR><BR>On this she came down from her upper room, and while doing so she 
<A NAME="76"></A>considered whether she should keep at a distance from her husband and question 
<A NAME="77"></A>him, or whether she should at once go up to him and embrace him. When, 
<A NAME="78"></A>however, she had crossed the stone floor of the cloister, she sat down 
<A NAME="79"></A>opposite Ulysses by the fire, against the wall at right angles [to that 
<A NAME="80"></A>by which she had entered], while Ulysses sat near one of the bearing-posts, 
<A NAME="81"></A>looking upon the ground, and waiting to see what his wife would say to 
<A NAME="82"></A>him when she saw him. For a long time she sat silent and as one lost in 
<A NAME="83"></A>amazement. At one moment she looked him full in the face, but then again 
<A NAME="84"></A>directly, she was misled by his shabby clothes and failed to recognize 
<A NAME="85"></A>him, till Telemachus began to reproach her and said:
<A NAME="86"></A><BR><BR>"Mother- but you are so hard that I cannot call you by such a name- 
<A NAME="87"></A>why do you keep away from my father in this way? Why do you not sit by 
<A NAME="88"></A>his side and begin talking to him and asking him questions? No other woman 
<A NAME="89"></A>could bear to keep away from her husband when he had come back to her after 
<A NAME="90"></A>twenty years of absence, and after having gone through so much; but your 
<A NAME="91"></A>heart always was as hard as a stone."
<A NAME="92"></A><BR><BR>Penelope answered, "My son, I am so lost in astonishment that I 
<A NAME="93"></A>can find no words in which either to ask questions or to answer them. I 
<A NAME="94"></A>cannot even look him straight in the face. Still, if he really is Ulysses 
<A NAME="95"></A>come back to his own home again, we shall get to understand one another 
<A NAME="96"></A>better by and by, for there are tokens with which we two are alone acquainted, 
<A NAME="97"></A>and which are hidden from all others."
<A NAME="98"></A><BR><BR>Ulysses smiled at this, and said to Telemachus, "Let your mother 
<A NAME="99"></A>put me to any proof she likes; she will make up her mind about it presently. 
<A NAME="100"></A>She rejects me for the moment and believes me to be somebody else, because 
<A NAME="101"></A>I am covered with dirt and have such bad clothes on; let us, however, consider 
<A NAME="102"></A>what we had better do next. When one man has killed another, even though 
<A NAME="103"></A>he was not one who would leave many friends to take up his quarrel, the 
<A NAME="104"></A>man who has killed him must still say good bye to his friends and fly the 
<A NAME="105"></A>country; whereas we have been killing the stay of a whole town, and all 
<A NAME="106"></A>the picked youth of Ithaca. I would have you consider this 
<A NAME="107"></A>matter."
<A NAME="108"></A><BR><BR>"Look to it yourself, father," answered Telemachus, "for they say 
<A NAME="109"></A>you are the wisest counsellor in the world, and that there is no other 
<A NAME="110"></A>mortal man who can compare with you. We will follow you with right good 
<A NAME="111"></A>will, nor shall you find us fail you in so far as our strength holds 
<A NAME="112"></A>out."
<A NAME="113"></A><BR><BR>"I will say what I think will be best," answered Ulysses. "First 
<A NAME="114"></A>wash and put your shirts on; tell the maids also to go to their own room 
<A NAME="115"></A>and dress; Phemius shall then strike up a dance tune on his lyre, so that 
<A NAME="116"></A>if people outside hear, or any of the neighbours, or some one going along 
<A NAME="117"></A>the street happens to notice it, they may think there is a wedding in the 
<A NAME="118"></A>house, and no rumours about the death of the suitors will get about in 
<A NAME="119"></A>the town, before we can escape to the woods upon my own land. Once there, 
<A NAME="120"></A>we will settle which of the courses heaven vouchsafes us shall seem 
<A NAME="121"></A>wisest."
<A NAME="122"></A><BR><BR>Thus did he speak, and they did even as he had said. First they 
<A NAME="123"></A>washed and put their shirts on, while the women got ready. Then Phemius 
<A NAME="124"></A>took his lyre and set them all longing for sweet song and stately dance. 
<A NAME="125"></A>The house re-echoed with the sound of men and women dancing, and the people 
<A NAME="126"></A>outside said, "I suppose the queen has been getting married at last. She 
<A NAME="127"></A>ought to be ashamed of herself for not continuing to protect her husband's 
<A NAME="128"></A>property until he comes home."
<A NAME="129"></A><BR><BR>This was what they said, but they did not know what it was that 
<A NAME="130"></A>had been happening. The upper servant Eurynome washed and anointed Ulysses 
<A NAME="131"></A>in his own house and gave him a shirt and cloak, while Minerva made him 
<A NAME="132"></A>look taller and stronger than before; she also made the hair grow thick 
<A NAME="133"></A>on the top of his head, and flow down in curls like hyacinth blossoms; 
<A NAME="134"></A>she glorified him about the head and shoulders just as a skilful workman 
<A NAME="135"></A>who has studied art of all kinds under Vulcan or Minerva- and his work 
<A NAME="136"></A>is full of beauty- enriches a piece of silver plate by gilding it. He came 
<A NAME="137"></A>from the bath looking like one of the immortals, and sat down opposite 
<A NAME="138"></A>his wife on the seat he had left. "My dear," said he, "heaven has endowed 
<A NAME="139"></A>you with a heart more unyielding than woman ever yet had. No other woman 
<A NAME="140"></A>could bear to keep away from her husband when he had come back to her after 
<A NAME="141"></A>twenty years of absence, and after having gone through so much. But come, 
<A NAME="142"></A>nurse, get a bed ready for me; I will sleep alone, for this woman has a 
<A NAME="143"></A>heart as hard as iron."
<A NAME="144"></A><BR><BR>"My dear," answered Penelope, "I have no wish to set myself up, 
<A NAME="145"></A>nor to depreciate you; but I am not struck by your appearance, for I very 
<A NAME="146"></A>well remember what kind of a man you were when you set sail from Ithaca. 
<A NAME="147"></A>Nevertheless, Euryclea, take his bed outside the bed chamber that he himself 
<A NAME="148"></A>built. Bring the bed outside this room, and put bedding upon it with fleeces, 
<A NAME="149"></A>good coverlets, and blankets."
<A NAME="150"></A><BR><BR>She said this to try him, but Ulysses was very angry and said, 
<A NAME="151"></A>"Wife, I am much displeased at what you have just been saying. Who has 
<A NAME="152"></A>been taking my bed from the place in which I left it? He must have found 
<A NAME="153"></A>it a hard task, no matter how skilled a workman he was, unless some god 
<A NAME="154"></A>came and helped him to shift it. There is no man living, however strong 
<A NAME="155"></A>and in his prime, who could move it from its place, for it is a marvellous 
<A NAME="156"></A>curiosity which I made with my very own hands. There was a young olive 
<A NAME="157"></A>growing within the precincts of the house, in full vigour, and about as 
<A NAME="158"></A>thick as a bearing-post. I built my room round this with strong walls of 
<A NAME="159"></A>stone and a roof to cover them, and I made the doors strong and well-fitting. 
<A NAME="160"></A>Then I cut off the top boughs of the olive tree and left the stump standing. 
<A NAME="161"></A>This I dressed roughly from the root upwards and then worked with carpenter's 
<A NAME="162"></A>tools well and skilfully, straightening my work by drawing a line on the 
<A NAME="163"></A>wood, and making it into a bed-prop. I then bored a hole down the middle, 
<A NAME="164"></A>and made it the centre-post of my bed, at which I worked till I had finished 
<A NAME="165"></A>it, inlaying it with gold and silver; after this I stretched a hide of 
<A NAME="166"></A>crimson leather from one side of it to the other. So you see I know all 
<A NAME="167"></A>about it, and I desire to learn whether it is still there, or whether any 
<A NAME="168"></A>one has been removing it by cutting down the olive tree at its 
<A NAME="169"></A>roots."
<A NAME="170"></A><BR><BR>When she heard the sure proofs Ulysses now gave her, she fairly 
<A NAME="171"></A>broke down. She flew weeping to his side, flung her arms about his neck, 
<A NAME="172"></A>and kissed him. "Do not be angry with me Ulysses," she cried, "you, who 
<A NAME="173"></A>are the wisest of mankind. We have suffered, both of us. Heaven has denied 
<A NAME="174"></A>us the happiness of spending our youth, and of growing old, together; do 
<A NAME="175"></A>not then be aggrieved or take it amiss that I did not embrace you thus 
<A NAME="176"></A>as soon as I saw you. I have been shuddering all the time through fear 
<A NAME="177"></A>that someone might come here and deceive me with a lying story; for there 
<A NAME="178"></A>are many very wicked people going about. Jove's daughter Helen would never 
<A NAME="179"></A>have yielded herself to a man from a foreign country, if she had known 
<A NAME="180"></A>that the sons of Achaeans would come after her and bring her back. Heaven 
<A NAME="181"></A>put it in her heart to do wrong, and she gave no thought to that sin, which 
<A NAME="182"></A>has been the source of all our sorrows. Now, however, that you have convinced 
<A NAME="183"></A>me by showing that you know all about our bed (which no human being has 
<A NAME="184"></A>ever seen but you and I and a single maid servant, the daughter of Actor, 
<A NAME="185"></A>who was given me by my father on my marriage, and who keeps the doors of 
<A NAME="186"></A>our room) hard of belief though I have been I can mistrust no 
<A NAME="187"></A>longer."
<A NAME="188"></A><BR><BR>Then Ulysses in his turn melted, and wept as he clasped his dear 
<A NAME="189"></A>and faithful wife to his bosom. As the sight of land is welcome to men 
<A NAME="190"></A>who are swimming towards the shore, when Neptune has wrecked their ship 
<A NAME="191"></A>with the fury of his winds and waves- a few alone reach the land, and these, 
<A NAME="192"></A>covered with brine, are thankful when they find themselves on firm ground 
<A NAME="193"></A>and out of danger- even so was her husband welcome to her as she looked 
<A NAME="194"></A>upon him, and she could not tear her two fair arms from about his neck. 
<A NAME="195"></A>Indeed they would have gone on indulging their sorrow till rosy-fingered 
<A NAME="196"></A>morn appeared, had not Minerva determined otherwise, and held night back 
<A NAME="197"></A>in the far west, while she would not suffer Dawn to leave Oceanus, nor 
<A NAME="198"></A>to yoke the two steeds Lampus and Phaethon that bear her onward to break 
<A NAME="199"></A>the day upon mankind.
<A NAME="200"></A><BR><BR>At last, however, Ulysses said, "Wife, we have not yet reached 
<A NAME="201"></A>the end of our troubles. I have an unknown amount of toil still to undergo. 
<A NAME="202"></A>It is long and difficult, but I must go through with it, for thus the shade 
<A NAME="203"></A>of Teiresias prophesied concerning me, on the day when I went down into 
<A NAME="204"></A>Hades to ask about my return and that of my companions. But now let us 
<A NAME="205"></A>go to bed, that we may lie down and enjoy the blessed boon of 
<A NAME="206"></A>sleep."
<A NAME="207"></A><BR><BR>"You shall go to bed as soon as you please," replied Penelope, 
<A NAME="208"></A>"now that the gods have sent you home to your own good house and to your 
<A NAME="209"></A>country. But as heaven has put it in your mind to speak of it, tell me 
<A NAME="210"></A>about the task that lies before you. I shall have to hear about it later, 
<A NAME="211"></A>so it is better that I should be told at once."
<A NAME="212"></A><BR><BR>"My dear," answered Ulysses, "why should you press me to tell you? 
<A NAME="213"></A>Still, I will not conceal it from you, though you will not like it. I do 
<A NAME="214"></A>not like it myself, for Teiresias bade me travel far and wide, carrying 
<A NAME="215"></A>an oar, till I came to a country where the people have never heard of the 
<A NAME="216"></A>sea, and do not even mix salt with their food. They know nothing about 
<A NAME="217"></A>ships, nor oars that are as the wings of a ship. He gave me this certain 
<A NAME="218"></A>token which I will not hide from you. He said that a wayfarer should meet 
<A NAME="219"></A>me and ask me whether it was a winnowing shovel that I had on my shoulder. 
<A NAME="220"></A>On this, I was to fix my oar in the ground and sacrifice a ram, a bull, 
<A NAME="221"></A>and a boar to Neptune; after which I was to go home and offer hecatombs 
<A NAME="222"></A>to all the gods in heaven, one after the other. As for myself, he said 
<A NAME="223"></A>that death should come to me from the sea, and that my life should ebb 
<A NAME="224"></A>away very gently when I was full of years and peace of mind, and my people 
<A NAME="225"></A>should bless me. All this, he said, should surely come to 
<A NAME="226"></A>pass."
<A NAME="227"></A><BR><BR>And Penelope said, "If the gods are going to vouchsafe you a happier 
<A NAME="228"></A>time in your old age, you may hope then to have some respite from 
<A NAME="229"></A>misfortune."
<A NAME="230"></A><BR><BR>Thus did they converse. Meanwhile Eurynome and the nurse took torches 
<A NAME="231"></A>and made the bed ready with soft coverlets; as soon as they had laid them, 
<A NAME="232"></A>the nurse went back into the house to go to her rest, leaving the bed chamber 
<A NAME="233"></A>woman Eurynome to show Ulysses and Penelope to bed by torch light. When 
<A NAME="234"></A>she had conducted them to their room she went back, and they then came 
<A NAME="235"></A>joyfully to the rites of their own old bed. Telemachus, Philoetius, and 
<A NAME="236"></A>the swineherd now left off dancing, and made the women leave off also. 
<A NAME="237"></A>They then laid themselves down to sleep in the cloisters.
<A NAME="238"></A><BR><BR>When Ulysses and Penelope had had their fill of love they fell 
<A NAME="239"></A>talking with one another. She told him how much she had had to bear in 
<A NAME="240"></A>seeing the house filled with a crowd of wicked suitors who had killed so 
<A NAME="241"></A>many sheep and oxen on her account, and had drunk so many casks of wine. 
<A NAME="242"></A>Ulysses in his turn told her what he had suffered, and how much trouble 
<A NAME="243"></A>he had himself given to other people. He told her everything, and she was 
<A NAME="244"></A>so delighted to listen that she never went to sleep till he had ended his 
<A NAME="245"></A>whole story.
<A NAME="246"></A><BR><BR>He began with his victory over the Cicons, and how he thence reached 
<A NAME="247"></A>the fertile land of the Lotus-eaters. He told her all about the Cyclops 
<A NAME="248"></A>and how he had punished him for having so ruthlessly eaten his brave comrades; 
<A NAME="249"></A>how he then went on to Aeolus, who received him hospitably and furthered 
<A NAME="250"></A>him on his way, but even so he was not to reach home, for to his great 
<A NAME="251"></A>grief a hurricane carried him out to sea again; how he went on to the Laestrygonian 
<A NAME="252"></A>city Telepylos, where the people destroyed all his ships with their crews, 
<A NAME="253"></A>save himself and his own ship only. Then he told of cunning Circe and her 
<A NAME="254"></A>craft, and how he sailed to the chill house of Hades, to consult the ghost 
<A NAME="255"></A>of the Theban prophet Teiresias, and how he saw his old comrades in arms, 
<A NAME="256"></A>and his mother who bore him and brought him up when he was a child; how 
<A NAME="257"></A>he then heard the wondrous singing of the Sirens, and went on to the wandering 
<A NAME="258"></A>rocks and terrible Charybdis and to Scylla, whom no man had ever yet passed 
<A NAME="259"></A>in safety; how his men then ate the cattle of the sun-god, and how Jove 
<A NAME="260"></A>therefore struck the ship with his thunderbolts, so that all his men perished 
<A NAME="261"></A>together, himself alone being left alive; how at last he reached the Ogygian 
<A NAME="262"></A>island and the nymph Calypso, who kept him there in a cave, and fed him, 
<A NAME="263"></A>and wanted him to marry her, in which case she intended making him immortal 
<A NAME="264"></A>so that he should never grow old, but she could not persuade him to let 
<A NAME="265"></A>her do so; and how after much suffering he had found his way to the Phaeacians, 
<A NAME="266"></A>who had treated him as though he had been a god, and sent him back in a 
<A NAME="267"></A>ship to his own country after having given him gold, bronze, and raiment 
<A NAME="268"></A>in great abundance. This was the last thing about which he told her, for 
<A NAME="269"></A>here a deep sleep took hold upon him and eased the burden of his 
<A NAME="270"></A>sorrows.
<A NAME="271"></A><BR><BR>Then Minerva bethought her of another matter. When she deemed that 
<A NAME="272"></A>Ulysses had had both of his wife and of repose, she bade gold-enthroned 
<A NAME="273"></A>Dawn rise out of Oceanus that she might shed light upon mankind. On this, 
<A NAME="274"></A>Ulysses rose from his comfortable bed and said to Penelope, "Wife, we have 
<A NAME="275"></A>both of us had our full share of troubles, you, here, in lamenting my absence, 
<A NAME="276"></A>and I in being prevented from getting home though I was longing all the 
<A NAME="277"></A>time to do so. Now, however, that we have at last come together, take care 
<A NAME="278"></A>of the property that is in the house. As for the sheep and goats which 
<A NAME="279"></A>the wicked suitors have eaten, I will take many myself by force from other 
<A NAME="280"></A>people, and will compel the Achaeans to make good the rest till they shall 
<A NAME="281"></A>have filled all my yards. I am now going to the wooded lands out in the 
<A NAME="282"></A>country to see my father who has so long been grieved on my account, and 
<A NAME="283"></A>to yourself I will give these instructions, though you have little need 
<A NAME="284"></A>of them. At sunrise it will at once get abroad that I have been killing 
<A NAME="285"></A>the suitors; go upstairs, therefore, and stay there with your women. See 
<A NAME="286"></A>nobody and ask no questions."
<A NAME="287"></A><BR><BR>As he spoke he girded on his armour. Then he roused Telemachus, 
<A NAME="288"></A>Philoetius, and Eumaeus, and told them all to put on their armour also. 
<A NAME="289"></A>This they did, and armed themselves. When they had done so, they opened 
<A NAME="290"></A>the gates and sallied forth, Ulysses leading the way. It was now daylight, 
<A NAME="291"></A>but Minerva nevertheless concealed them in darkness and led them quickly 
<A NAME="292"></A>out of the town.
