<A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A>When the companies were thus arrayed, each under its own captain, the Trojans 
<A NAME="11"></A>advanced as a flight of wild fowl or cranes that scream overhead when rain 
<A NAME="12"></A>and winter drive them over the flowing waters of Oceanus to bring death 
<A NAME="13"></A>and destruction on the Pygmies, and they wrangle in the air as they fly; 
<A NAME="14"></A>but the Achaeans marched silently, in high heart, and minded to stand by 
<A NAME="15"></A>one another.
<A NAME="16"></A><BR><BR>As when the south wind spreads a curtain of mist upon the mountain 
<A NAME="17"></A>tops, bad for shepherds but better than night for thieves, and a man can 
<A NAME="18"></A>see no further than he can throw a stone, even so rose the dust from under 
<A NAME="19"></A>their feet as they made all speed over the plain.
<A NAME="20"></A><BR><BR>When they were close up with one another, Alexandrus came forward 
<A NAME="21"></A>as champion on the Trojan side. On his shoulders he bore the skin of a 
<A NAME="22"></A>panther, his bow, and his sword, and he brandished two spears shod with 
<A NAME="23"></A>bronze as a challenge to the bravest of the Achaeans to meet him in single 
<A NAME="24"></A>fight. Menelaus saw him thus stride out before the ranks, and was glad 
<A NAME="25"></A>as a hungry lion that lights on the carcase of some goat or horned stag, 
<A NAME="26"></A>and devours it there and then, though dogs and youths set upon him. Even 
<A NAME="27"></A>thus was Menelaus glad when his eyes caught sight of Alexandrus, for he 
<A NAME="28"></A>deemed that now he should be revenged. He sprang, therefore, from his chariot, 
<A NAME="29"></A>clad in his suit of armour.
<A NAME="30"></A><BR><BR>Alexandrus quailed as he saw Menelaus come forward, and shrank 
<A NAME="31"></A>in fear of his life under cover of his men. As one who starts back affrighted, 
<A NAME="32"></A>trembling and pale, when he comes suddenly upon a serpent in some mountain 
<A NAME="33"></A>glade, even so did Alexandrus plunge into the throng of Trojan warriors, 
<A NAME="34"></A>terror-stricken at the sight of the son Atreus.
<A NAME="35"></A><BR><BR>Then Hector upbraided him. "Paris," said he, "evil-hearted Paris, 
<A NAME="36"></A>fair to see, but woman-mad, and false of tongue, would that you had never 
<A NAME="37"></A>been born, or that you had died unwed. Better so, than live to be disgraced 
<A NAME="38"></A>and looked askance at. Will not the Achaeans mock at us and say that we 
<A NAME="39"></A>have sent one to champion us who is fair to see but who has neither wit 
<A NAME="40"></A>nor courage? Did you not, such as you are, get your following together 
<A NAME="41"></A>and sail beyond the seas? Did you not from your a far country carry off 
<A NAME="42"></A>a lovely woman wedded among a people of warriors- to bring sorrow upon 
<A NAME="43"></A>your father, your city, and your whole country, but joy to your enemies, 
<A NAME="44"></A>and hang-dog shamefacedness to yourself? And now can you not dare face 
<A NAME="45"></A>Menelaus and learn what manner of man he is whose wife you have stolen? 
<A NAME="46"></A>Where indeed would be your lyre and your love-tricks, your comely locks 
<A NAME="47"></A>and your fair favour, when you were lying in the dust before him? The Trojans 
<A NAME="48"></A>are a weak-kneed people, or ere this you would have had a shirt of stones 
<A NAME="49"></A>for the wrongs you have done them."
<A NAME="50"></A><BR><BR>And Alexandrus answered, "Hector, your rebuke is just. You are 
<A NAME="51"></A>hard as the axe which a shipwright wields at his work, and cleaves the 
<A NAME="52"></A>timber to his liking. As the axe in his hand, so keen is the edge of your 
<A NAME="53"></A>scorn. Still, taunt me not with the gifts that golden Venus has given me; 
<A NAME="54"></A>they are precious; let not a man disdain them, for the gods give them where 
<A NAME="55"></A>they are minded, and none can have them for the asking. If you would have 
<A NAME="56"></A>me do battle with Menelaus, bid the Trojans and Achaeans take their seats, 
<A NAME="57"></A>while he and I fight in their midst for Helen and all her wealth. Let him 
<A NAME="58"></A>who shall be victorious and prove to be the better man take the woman and 
<A NAME="59"></A>all she has, to bear them to his home, but let the rest swear to a solemn 
<A NAME="60"></A>covenant of peace whereby you Trojans shall stay here in Troy, while the 
<A NAME="61"></A>others go home to Argos and the land of the Achaeans."
<A NAME="62"></A><BR><BR>When Hector heard this he was glad, and went about among the Trojan 
<A NAME="63"></A>ranks holding his spear by the middle to keep them back, and they all sat 
<A NAME="64"></A>down at his bidding: but the Achaeans still aimed at him with stones and 
<A NAME="65"></A>arrows, till Agamemnon shouted to them saying, "Hold, Argives, shoot not, 
<A NAME="66"></A>sons of the Achaeans; Hector desires to speak."
<A NAME="67"></A><BR><BR>They ceased taking aim and were still, whereon Hector spoke. "Hear 
<A NAME="68"></A>from my mouth," said he, "Trojans and Achaeans, the saying of Alexandrus, 
<A NAME="69"></A>through whom this quarrel has come about. He bids the Trojans and Achaeans 
<A NAME="70"></A>lay their armour upon the ground, while he and Menelaus fight in the midst 
<A NAME="71"></A>of you for Helen and all her wealth. Let him who shall be victorious and 
<A NAME="72"></A>prove to be the better man take the woman and all she has, to bear them 
<A NAME="73"></A>to his own home, but let the rest swear to a solemn covenant of 
<A NAME="74"></A>peace."
<A NAME="75"></A><BR><BR>Thus he spoke, and they all held their peace, till Menelaus of 
<A NAME="76"></A>the loud battle-cry addressed them. "And now," he said, "hear me too, for 
<A NAME="77"></A>it is I who am the most aggrieved. I deem that the parting of Achaeans 
<A NAME="78"></A>and Trojans is at hand, as well it may be, seeing how much have suffered 
<A NAME="79"></A>for my quarrel with Alexandrus and the wrong he did me. Let him who shall 
<A NAME="80"></A>die, die, and let the others fight no more. Bring, then, two lambs, a white 
<A NAME="81"></A>ram and a black ewe, for Earth and Sun, and we will bring a third for Jove. 
<A NAME="82"></A>Moreover, you shall bid Priam come, that he may swear to the covenant himself; 
<A NAME="83"></A>for his sons are high-handed and ill to trust, and the oaths of Jove must 
<A NAME="84"></A>not be transgressed or taken in vain. Young men's minds are light as air, 
<A NAME="85"></A>but when an old man comes he looks before and after, deeming that which 
<A NAME="86"></A>shall be fairest upon both sides."
<A NAME="87"></A><BR><BR>The Trojans and Achaeans were glad when they heard this, for they 
<A NAME="88"></A>thought that they should now have rest. They backed their chariots toward 
<A NAME="89"></A>the ranks, got out of them, and put off their armour, laying it down upon 
<A NAME="90"></A>the ground; and the hosts were near to one another with a little space 
<A NAME="91"></A>between them. Hector sent two messengers to the city to bring the lambs 
<A NAME="92"></A>and to bid Priam come, while Agamemnon told Talthybius to fetch the other 
<A NAME="93"></A>lamb from the ships, and he did as Agamemnon had said.
<A NAME="94"></A><BR><BR>Meanwhile Iris went to Helen in the form of her sister-in-law, 
<A NAME="95"></A>wife of the son of Antenor, for Helicaon, son of Antenor, had married Laodice, 
<A NAME="96"></A>the fairest of Priam's daughters. She found her in her own room, working 
<A NAME="97"></A>at a great web of purple linen, on which she was embroidering the battles 
<A NAME="98"></A>between Trojans and Achaeans, that Mars had made them fight for her sake. 
<A NAME="99"></A>Iris then came close up to her and said, "Come hither, child, and see the 
<A NAME="100"></A>strange doings of the Trojans and Achaeans till now they have been warring 
<A NAME="101"></A>upon the plain, mad with lust of battle, but now they have left off fighting, 
<A NAME="102"></A>and are leaning upon their shields, sitting still with their spears planted 
<A NAME="103"></A>beside them. Alexandrus and Menelaus are going to fight about yourself, 
<A NAME="104"></A>and you are to the the wife of him who is the victor."
<A NAME="105"></A><BR><BR>Thus spoke the goddess, and Helen's heart yearned after her former 
<A NAME="106"></A>husband, her city, and her parents. She threw a white mantle over her head, 
<A NAME="107"></A>and hurried from her room, weeping as she went, not alone, but attended 
<A NAME="108"></A>by two of her handmaids, Aethrae, daughter of Pittheus, and Clymene. And 
<A NAME="109"></A>straightway they were at the Scaean gates.
<A NAME="110"></A><BR><BR>The two sages, Ucalegon and Antenor, elders of the people, were 
<A NAME="111"></A>seated by the Scaean gates, with Priam, Panthous, Thymoetes, Lampus, Clytius, 
<A NAME="112"></A>and Hiketaon of the race of Mars. These were too old to fight, but they 
<A NAME="113"></A>were fluent orators, and sat on the tower like cicales that chirrup delicately 
<A NAME="114"></A>from the boughs of some high tree in a wood. When they saw Helen coming 
<A NAME="115"></A>towards the tower, they said softly to one another, "Small wonder that 
<A NAME="116"></A>Trojans and Achaeans should endure so much and so long, for the sake of 
<A NAME="117"></A>a woman so marvellously and divinely lovely. Still, fair though she be, 
<A NAME="118"></A>let them take her and go, or she will breed sorrow for us and for our children 
<A NAME="119"></A>after us."
<A NAME="120"></A><BR><BR>But Priam bade her draw nigh. "My child," said he, "take your seat 
<A NAME="121"></A>in front of me that you may see your former husband, your kinsmen and your 
<A NAME="122"></A>friends. I lay no blame upon you, it is the gods, not you who are to blame. 
<A NAME="123"></A>It is they that have brought about this terrible war with the Achaeans. 
<A NAME="124"></A>Tell me, then, who is yonder huge hero so great and goodly? I have seen 
<A NAME="125"></A>men taller by a head, but none so comely and so royal. Surely he must be 
<A NAME="126"></A>a king."
<A NAME="127"></A><BR><BR>"Sir," answered Helen, "father of my husband, dear and reverend 
<A NAME="128"></A>in my eyes, would that I had chosen death rather than to have come here 
<A NAME="129"></A>with your son, far from my bridal chamber, my friends, my darling daughter, 
<A NAME="130"></A>and all the companions of my girlhood. But it was not to be, and my lot 
<A NAME="131"></A>is one of tears and sorrow. As for your question, the hero of whom you 
<A NAME="132"></A>ask is Agamemnon, son of Atreus, a good king and a brave soldier, brother-in-law 
<A NAME="133"></A>as surely as that he lives, to my abhorred and miserable 
<A NAME="134"></A>self."
<A NAME="135"></A><BR><BR>The old man marvelled at him and said, "Happy son of Atreus, child 
<A NAME="136"></A>of good fortune. I see that the Achaeans are subject to you in great multitudes. 
<A NAME="137"></A>When I was in Phrygia I saw much horsemen, the people of Otreus and of 
<A NAME="138"></A>Mygdon, who were camping upon the banks of the river Sangarius; I was their 
<A NAME="139"></A>ally, and with them when the Amazons, peers of men, came up against them, 
<A NAME="140"></A>but even they were not so many as the Achaeans."
<A NAME="141"></A><BR><BR>The old man next looked upon Ulysses; "Tell me," he said, "who 
<A NAME="142"></A>is that other, shorter by a head than Agamemnon, but broader across the 
<A NAME="143"></A>chest and shoulders? His armour is laid upon the ground, and he stalks 
<A NAME="144"></A>in front of the ranks as it were some great woolly ram ordering his 
<A NAME="145"></A>ewes."
<A NAME="146"></A><BR><BR>And Helen answered, "He is Ulysses, a man of great craft, son of 
<A NAME="147"></A>Laertes. He was born in rugged Ithaca, and excels in all manner of stratagems 
<A NAME="148"></A>and subtle cunning."
<A NAME="149"></A><BR><BR>On this Antenor said, "Madam, you have spoken truly. Ulysses once 
<A NAME="150"></A>came here as envoy about yourself, and Menelaus with him. I received them 
<A NAME="151"></A>in my own house, and therefore know both of them by sight and conversation. 
<A NAME="152"></A>When they stood up in presence of the assembled Trojans, Menelaus was the 
<A NAME="153"></A>broader shouldered, but when both were seated Ulysses had the more royal 
<A NAME="154"></A>presence. After a time they delivered their message, and the speech of 
<A NAME="155"></A>Menelaus ran trippingly on the tongue; he did not say much, for he was 
<A NAME="156"></A>a man of few words, but he spoke very clearly and to the point, though 
<A NAME="157"></A>he was the younger man of the two; Ulysses, on the other hand, when he 
<A NAME="158"></A>rose to speak, was at first silent and kept his eyes fixed upon the ground. 
<A NAME="159"></A>There was no play nor graceful movement of his sceptre; he kept it straight 
<A NAME="160"></A>and stiff like a man unpractised in oratory- one might have taken him for 
<A NAME="161"></A>a mere churl or simpleton; but when he raised his voice, and the words 
<A NAME="162"></A>came driving from his deep chest like winter snow before the wind, then 
<A NAME="163"></A>there was none to touch him, and no man thought further of what he looked 
<A NAME="164"></A>like."
<A NAME="165"></A><BR><BR>Priam then caught sight of Ajax and asked, "Who is that great and 
<A NAME="166"></A>goodly warrior whose head and broad shoulders tower above the rest of the 
<A NAME="167"></A>Argives?"
<A NAME="168"></A><BR><BR>"That," answered Helen, "is huge Ajax, bulwark of the Achaeans, 
<A NAME="169"></A>and on the other side of him, among the Cretans, stands Idomeneus looking 
<A NAME="170"></A>like a god, and with the captains of the Cretans round him. Often did Menelaus 
<A NAME="171"></A>receive him as a guest in our house when he came visiting us from Crete. 
<A NAME="172"></A>I see, moreover, many other Achaeans whose names I could tell you, but 
<A NAME="173"></A>there are two whom I can nowhere find, Castor, breaker of horses, and Pollux 
<A NAME="174"></A>the mighty boxer; they are children of my mother, and own brothers to myself. 
<A NAME="175"></A>Either they have not left Lacedaemon, or else, though they have brought 
<A NAME="176"></A>their ships, they will not show themselves in battle for the shame and 
<A NAME="177"></A>disgrace that I have brought upon them."
<A NAME="178"></A><BR><BR>She knew not that both these heroes were already lying under the 
<A NAME="179"></A>earth in their own land of Lacedaemon.
<A NAME="180"></A><BR><BR>Meanwhile the heralds were bringing the holy oath-offerings through 
<A NAME="181"></A>the city- two lambs and a goatskin of wine, the gift of earth; and Idaeus 
<A NAME="182"></A>brought the mixing bowl and the cups of gold. He went up to Priam and said, 
<A NAME="183"></A>"Son of Laomedon, the princes of the Trojans and Achaeans bid you come 
<A NAME="184"></A>down on to the plain and swear to a solemn covenant. Alexandrus and Menelaus 
<A NAME="185"></A>are to fight for Helen in single combat, that she and all her wealth may 
<A NAME="186"></A>go with him who is the victor. We are to swear to a solemn covenant of 
<A NAME="187"></A>peace whereby we others shall dwell here in Troy, while the Achaeans return 
<A NAME="188"></A>to Argos and the land of the Achaeans."
<A NAME="189"></A><BR><BR>The old man trembled as he heard, but bade his followers yoke the 
<A NAME="190"></A>horses, and they made all haste to do so. He mounted the chariot, gathered 
<A NAME="191"></A>the reins in his hand, and Antenor took his seat beside him; they then 
<A NAME="192"></A>drove through the Scaean gates on to the plain. When they reached the ranks 
<A NAME="193"></A>of the Trojans and Achaeans they left the chariot, and with measured pace 
<A NAME="194"></A>advanced into the space between the hosts.
<A NAME="195"></A><BR><BR>Agamemnon and Ulysses both rose to meet them. The attendants brought 
<A NAME="196"></A>on the oath-offerings and mixed the wine in the mixing-bowls; they poured 
<A NAME="197"></A>water over the hands of the chieftains, and the son of Atreus drew the 
<A NAME="198"></A>dagger that hung by his sword, and cut wool from the lambs' heads; this 
<A NAME="199"></A>the men-servants gave about among the Trojan and Achaean princes, and the 
<A NAME="200"></A>son of Atreus lifted up his hands in prayer. "Father Jove," he cried, "that 
<A NAME="201"></A>rulest in Ida, most glorious in power, and thou oh Sun, that seest and 
<A NAME="202"></A>givest ear to all things, Earth and Rivers, and ye who in the realms below 
<A NAME="203"></A>chastise the soul of him that has broken his oath, witness these rites 
<A NAME="204"></A>and guard them, that they be not vain. If Alexandrus kills Menelaus, let 
<A NAME="205"></A>him keep Helen and all her wealth, while we sail home with our ships; but 
<A NAME="206"></A>if Menelaus kills Alexandrus, let the Trojans give back Helen and all that 
<A NAME="207"></A>she has; let them moreover pay such fine to the Achaeans as shall be agreed 
<A NAME="208"></A>upon, in testimony among those that shall be born hereafter. Aid if Priam 
<A NAME="209"></A>and his sons refuse such fine when Alexandrus has fallen, then will I stay 
<A NAME="210"></A>here and fight on till I have got satisfaction."
<A NAME="211"></A><BR><BR>As he spoke he drew his knife across the throats of the victims, 
<A NAME="212"></A>and laid them down gasping and dying upon the ground, for the knife had 
<A NAME="213"></A>reft them of their strength. Then they poured wine from the mixing-bowl 
<A NAME="214"></A>into the cups, and prayed to the everlasting gods, saying, Trojans and 
<A NAME="215"></A>Achaeans among one another, "Jove, most great and glorious, and ye other 
<A NAME="216"></A>everlasting gods, grant that the brains of them who shall first sin against 
<A NAME="217"></A>their oaths- of them and their children- may be shed upon the ground even 
<A NAME="218"></A>as this wine, and let their wives become the slaves of 
<A NAME="219"></A>strangers."
<A NAME="220"></A><BR><BR>Thus they prayed, but not as yet would Jove grant them their prayer. 
<A NAME="221"></A>Then Priam, descendant of Dardanus, spoke, saying, "Hear me, Trojans and 
<A NAME="222"></A>Achaeans, I will now go back to the wind-beaten city of Ilius: I dare not 
<A NAME="223"></A>with my own eyes witness this fight between my son and Menelaus, for Jove 
<A NAME="224"></A>and the other immortals alone know which shall fall."
<A NAME="225"></A><BR><BR>On this he laid the two lambs on his chariot and took his seat. 
<A NAME="226"></A>He gathered the reins in his hand, and Antenor sat beside him; the two 
<A NAME="227"></A>then went back to Ilius. Hector and Ulysses measured the ground, and cast 
<A NAME="228"></A>lots from a helmet of bronze to see which should take aim first. Meanwhile 
<A NAME="229"></A>the two hosts lifted up their hands and prayed saying, "Father Jove, that 
<A NAME="230"></A>rulest from Ida, most glorious in power, grant that he who first brought 
<A NAME="231"></A>about this war between us may die, and enter the house of Hades, while 
<A NAME="232"></A>we others remain at peace and abide by our oaths."
<A NAME="233"></A><BR><BR>Great Hector now turned his head aside while he shook the helmet, 
<A NAME="234"></A>and the lot of Paris flew out first. The others took their several stations, 
<A NAME="235"></A>each by his horses and the place where his arms were lying, while Alexandrus, 
<A NAME="236"></A>husband of lovely Helen, put on his goodly armour. First he greaved his 
<A NAME="237"></A>legs with greaves of good make and fitted with ancle-clasps of silver; 
<A NAME="238"></A>after this he donned the cuirass of his brother Lycaon, and fitted it to 
<A NAME="239"></A>his own body; he hung his silver-studded sword of bronze about his shoulders, 
<A NAME="240"></A>and then his mighty shield. On his comely head he set his helmet, well-wrought, 
<A NAME="241"></A>with a crest of horse-hair that nodded menacingly above it, and he grasped 
<A NAME="242"></A>a redoubtable spear that suited his hands. In like fashion Menelaus also 
<A NAME="243"></A>put on his armour.
<A NAME="244"></A><BR><BR>When they had thus armed, each amid his own people, they strode 
<A NAME="245"></A>fierce of aspect into the open space, and both Trojans and Achaeans were 
<A NAME="246"></A>struck with awe as they beheld them. They stood near one another on the 
<A NAME="247"></A>measured ground, brandishing their spears, and each furious against the 
<A NAME="248"></A>other. Alexandrus aimed first, and struck the round shield of the son of 
<A NAME="249"></A>Atreus, but the spear did not pierce it, for the shield turned its point. 
<A NAME="250"></A>Menelaus next took aim, praying to Father Jove as he did so. "King Jove," 
<A NAME="251"></A>he said, "grant me revenge on Alexandrus who has wronged me; subdue him 
<A NAME="252"></A>under my hand that in ages yet to come a man may shrink from doing ill 
<A NAME="253"></A>deeds in the house of his host."
<A NAME="254"></A><BR><BR>He poised his spear as he spoke, and hurled it at the shield of 
<A NAME="255"></A>Alexandrus. Through shield and cuirass it went, and tore the shirt by his 
<A NAME="256"></A>flank, but Alexandrus swerved aside, and thus saved his life. Then the 
<A NAME="257"></A>son of Atreus drew his sword, and drove at the projecting part of his helmet, 
<A NAME="258"></A>but the sword fell shivered in three or four pieces from his hand, and 
<A NAME="259"></A>he cried, looking towards Heaven, "Father Jove, of all gods thou art the 
<A NAME="260"></A>most despiteful; I made sure of my revenge, but the sword has broken in 
<A NAME="261"></A>my hand, my spear has been hurled in vain, and I have not killed 
<A NAME="262"></A>him."
<A NAME="263"></A><BR><BR>With this he flew at Alexandrus, caught him by the horsehair plume 
<A NAME="264"></A>of his helmet, and began dragging him towards the Achaeans. The strap of 
<A NAME="265"></A>the helmet that went under his chin was choking him, and Menelaus would 
<A NAME="266"></A>have dragged him off to his own great glory had not Jove's daughter Venus 
<A NAME="267"></A>been quick to mark and to break the strap of oxhide, so that the empty 
<A NAME="268"></A>helmet came away in his hand. This he flung to his comrades among the Achaeans, 
<A NAME="269"></A>and was again springing upon Alexandrus to run him through with a spear, 
<A NAME="270"></A>but Venus snatched him up in a moment (as a god can do), hid him under 
<A NAME="271"></A>a cloud of darkness, and conveyed him to his own bedchamber.
<A NAME="272"></A><BR><BR>Then she went to call Helen, and found her on a high tower with 
<A NAME="273"></A>the Trojan women crowding round her. She took the form of an old woman 
<A NAME="274"></A>who used to dress wool for her when she was still in Lacedaemon, and of 
<A NAME="275"></A>whom she was very fond. Thus disguised she plucked her by perfumed robe 
<A NAME="276"></A>and said, "Come hither; Alexandrus says you are to go to the house; he 
<A NAME="277"></A>is on his bed in his own room, radiant with beauty and dressed in gorgeous 
<A NAME="278"></A>apparel. No one would think he had just come from fighting, but rather 
<A NAME="279"></A>that he was going to a dance, or had done dancing and was sitting 
<A NAME="280"></A>down."
<A NAME="281"></A><BR><BR>With these words she moved the heart of Helen to anger. When she 
<A NAME="282"></A>marked the beautiful neck of the goddess, her lovely bosom, and sparkling 
<A NAME="283"></A>eyes, she marvelled at her and said, "Goddess, why do you thus beguile 
<A NAME="284"></A>me? Are you going to send me afield still further to some man whom you 
<A NAME="285"></A>have taken up in Phrygia or fair Meonia? Menelaus has just vanquished Alexandrus, 
<A NAME="286"></A>and is to take my hateful self back with him. You are come here to betray 
<A NAME="287"></A>me. Go sit with Alexandrus yourself; henceforth be goddess no longer; never 
<A NAME="288"></A>let your feet carry you back to Olympus; worry about him and look after 
<A NAME="289"></A>him till he make you his wife, or, for the matter of that, his slave- but 
<A NAME="290"></A>me? I shall not go; I can garnish his bed no longer; I should be a by-word 
<A NAME="291"></A>among all the women of Troy. Besides, I have trouble on my 
<A NAME="292"></A>mind."
<A NAME="293"></A><BR><BR>Venus was very angry, and said, "Bold hussy, do not provoke me; 
<A NAME="294"></A>if you do, I shall leave you to your fate and hate you as much as I have 
<A NAME="295"></A>loved you. I will stir up fierce hatred between Trojans and Achaeans, and 
<A NAME="296"></A>you shall come to a bad end."
<A NAME="297"></A><BR><BR>At this Helen was frightened. She wrapped her mantle about her 
<A NAME="298"></A>and went in silence, following the goddess and unnoticed by the Trojan 
<A NAME="299"></A>women.
<A NAME="300"></A><BR><BR>When they came to the house of Alexandrus the maid-servants set 
<A NAME="301"></A>about their work, but Helen went into her own room, and the laughter-loving 
<A NAME="302"></A>goddess took a seat and set it for her facing Alexandrus. On this Helen, 
<A NAME="303"></A>daughter of aegis-bearing Jove, sat down, and with eyes askance began to 
<A NAME="304"></A>upbraid her husband.
<A NAME="305"></A><BR><BR>"So you are come from the fight," said she; "would that you had 
<A NAME="306"></A>fallen rather by the hand of that brave man who was my husband. You used 
<A NAME="307"></A>to brag that you were a better man with hands and spear than Menelaus. 
<A NAME="308"></A>go, but I then, an challenge him again- but I should advise you not to 
<A NAME="309"></A>do so, for if you are foolish enough to meet him in single combat, you 
<A NAME="310"></A>will soon all by his spear."
<A NAME="311"></A><BR><BR>And Paris answered, "Wife, do not vex me with your reproaches. 
<A NAME="312"></A>This time, with the help of Minerva, Menelaus has vanquished me; another 
<A NAME="313"></A>time I may myself be victor, for I too have gods that will stand by me. 
<A NAME="314"></A>Come, let us lie down together and make friends. Never yet was I so passionately 
<A NAME="315"></A>enamoured of you as at this moment- not even when I first carried you off 
<A NAME="316"></A>from Lacedaemon and sailed away with you- not even when I had converse 
<A NAME="317"></A>with you upon the couch of love in the island of Cranae was I so enthralled 
<A NAME="318"></A>by desire of you as now." On this he led her towards the bed, and his wife 
<A NAME="319"></A>went with him.
<A NAME="320"></A><BR><BR>Thus they laid themselves on the bed together; but the son of Atreus 
<A NAME="321"></A>strode among the throng, looking everywhere for Alexandrus, and no man, 
<A NAME="322"></A>neither of the Trojans nor of the allies, could find him. If they had seen 
<A NAME="323"></A>him they were in no mind to hide him, for they all of them hated him as 
<A NAME="324"></A>they did death itself. Then Agamemnon, king of men, spoke, saying, "Hear 
<A NAME="325"></A>me, Trojans, Dardanians, and allies. The victory has been with Menelaus; 
<A NAME="326"></A>therefore give back Helen with all her wealth, and pay such fine as shall 
<A NAME="327"></A>be agreed upon, in testimony among them that shall be born 
<A NAME="328"></A>hereafter."
<A NAME="329"></A><BR><BR>Thus spoke the son of Atreus, and the Achaeans shouted in 
<A NAME="330"></A>applause.
