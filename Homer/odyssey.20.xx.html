<A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A>Ulysses slept in the cloister upon an undressed bullock's hide, on the 
<A NAME="11"></A>top of which he threw several skins of the sheep the suitors had eaten, 
<A NAME="12"></A>and Eurynome threw a cloak over him after he had laid himself down. There, 
<A NAME="13"></A>then, Ulysses lay wakefully brooding upon the way in which he should kill 
<A NAME="14"></A>the suitors; and by and by, the women who had been in the habit of misconducting 
<A NAME="15"></A>themselves with them, left the house giggling and laughing with one another. 
<A NAME="16"></A>This made Ulysses very angry, and he doubted whether to get up and kill 
<A NAME="17"></A>every single one of them then and there, or to let them sleep one more 
<A NAME="18"></A>and last time with the suitors. His heart growled within him, and as a 
<A NAME="19"></A>bitch with puppies growls and shows her teeth when she sees a stranger, 
<A NAME="20"></A>so did his heart growl with anger at the evil deeds that were being done: 
<A NAME="21"></A>but he beat his breast and said, "Heart, be still, you had worse than this 
<A NAME="22"></A>to bear on the day when the terrible Cyclops ate your brave companions; 
<A NAME="23"></A>yet you bore it in silence till your cunning got you safe out of the cave, 
<A NAME="24"></A>though you made sure of being killed."
<A NAME="25"></A><BR><BR>Thus he chided with his heart, and checked it into endurance, but 
<A NAME="26"></A>he tossed about as one who turns a paunch full of blood and fat in front 
<A NAME="27"></A>of a hot fire, doing it first on one side and then on the other, that he 
<A NAME="28"></A>may get it cooked as soon as possible, even so did he turn himself about 
<A NAME="29"></A>from side to side, thinking all the time how, single handed as he was, 
<A NAME="30"></A>he should contrive to kill so large a body of men as the wicked suitors. 
<A NAME="31"></A>But by and by Minerva came down from heaven in the likeness of a woman, 
<A NAME="32"></A>and hovered over his head saying, "My poor unhappy man, why do you lie 
<A NAME="33"></A>awake in this way? This is your house: your wife is safe inside it, and 
<A NAME="34"></A>so is your son who is just such a young man as any father may be proud 
<A NAME="35"></A>of."
<A NAME="36"></A><BR><BR>"Goddess," answered Ulysses, "all that you have said is true, but 
<A NAME="37"></A>I am in some doubt as to how I shall be able to kill these wicked suitors 
<A NAME="38"></A>single handed, seeing what a number of them there always are. And there 
<A NAME="39"></A>is this further difficulty, which is still more considerable. Supposing 
<A NAME="40"></A>that with Jove's and your assistance I succeed in killing them, I must 
<A NAME="41"></A>ask you to consider where I am to escape to from their avengers when it 
<A NAME="42"></A>is all over."
<A NAME="43"></A><BR><BR>"For shame," replied Minerva, "why, any one else would trust a 
<A NAME="44"></A>worse ally than myself, even though that ally were only a mortal and less 
<A NAME="45"></A>wise than I am. Am I not a goddess, and have I not protected you throughout 
<A NAME="46"></A>in all your troubles? I tell you plainly that even though there were fifty 
<A NAME="47"></A>bands of men surrounding us and eager to kill us, you should take all their 
<A NAME="48"></A>sheep and cattle, and drive them away with you. But go to sleep; it is 
<A NAME="49"></A>a very bad thing to lie awake all night, and you shall be out of your troubles 
<A NAME="50"></A>before long."
<A NAME="51"></A><BR><BR>As she spoke she shed sleep over his eyes, and then went back to 
<A NAME="52"></A>Olympus.
<A NAME="53"></A><BR><BR>While Ulysses was thus yielding himself to a very deep slumber 
<A NAME="54"></A>that eased the burden of his sorrows, his admirable wife awoke, and sitting 
<A NAME="55"></A>up in her bed began to cry. When she had relieved herself by weeping she 
<A NAME="56"></A>prayed to Diana saying, "Great Goddess Diana, daughter of Jove, drive an 
<A NAME="57"></A>arrow into my heart and slay me; or let some whirlwind snatch me up and 
<A NAME="58"></A>bear me through paths of darkness till it drop me into the mouths of overflowing 
<A NAME="59"></A>Oceanus, as it did the daughters of Pandareus. The daughters of Pandareus 
<A NAME="60"></A>lost their father and mother, for the gods killed them, so they were left 
<A NAME="61"></A>orphans. But Venus took care of them, and fed them on cheese, honey, and 
<A NAME="62"></A>sweet wine. Juno taught them to excel all women in beauty of form and understanding; 
<A NAME="63"></A>Diana gave them an imposing presence, and Minerva endowed them with every 
<A NAME="64"></A>kind of accomplishment; but one day when Venus had gone up to Olympus to 
<A NAME="65"></A>see Jove about getting them married (for well does he know both what shall 
<A NAME="66"></A>happen and what not happen to every one) the storm winds came and spirited 
<A NAME="67"></A>them away to become handmaids to the dread Erinyes. Even so I wish that 
<A NAME="68"></A>the gods who live in heaven would hide me from mortal sight, or that fair 
<A NAME="69"></A>Diana might strike me, for I would fain go even beneath the sad earth if 
<A NAME="70"></A>I might do so still looking towards Ulysses only, and without having to 
<A NAME="71"></A>yield myself to a worse man than he was. Besides, no matter how much people 
<A NAME="72"></A>may grieve by day, they can put up with it so long as they can sleep at 
<A NAME="73"></A>night, for when the eyes are closed in slumber people forget good and ill 
<A NAME="74"></A>alike; whereas my misery haunts me even in my dreams. This very night methought 
<A NAME="75"></A>there was one lying by my side who was like Ulysses as he was when he went 
<A NAME="76"></A>away with his host, and I rejoiced, for I believed that it was no dream, 
<A NAME="77"></A>but the very truth itself."
<A NAME="78"></A><BR><BR>On this the day broke, but Ulysses heard the sound of her weeping, 
<A NAME="79"></A>and it puzzled him, for it seemed as though she already knew him and was 
<A NAME="80"></A>by his side. Then he gathered up the cloak and the fleeces on which he 
<A NAME="81"></A>had lain, and set them on a seat in the cloister, but he took the bullock's 
<A NAME="82"></A>hide out into the open. He lifted up his hands to heaven, and prayed, saying 
<A NAME="83"></A>"Father Jove, since you have seen fit to bring me over land and sea to 
<A NAME="84"></A>my own home after all the afflictions you have laid upon me, give me a 
<A NAME="85"></A>sign out of the mouth of some one or other of those who are now waking 
<A NAME="86"></A>within the house, and let me have another sign of some kind from 
<A NAME="87"></A>outside."
<A NAME="88"></A><BR><BR>Thus did he pray. Jove heard his prayer and forthwith thundered 
<A NAME="89"></A>high up among the from the splendour of Olympus, and Ulysses was glad when 
<A NAME="90"></A>he heard it. At the same time within the house, a miller-woman from hard 
<A NAME="91"></A>by in the mill room lifted up her voice and gave him another sign. There 
<A NAME="92"></A>were twelve miller-women whose business it was to grind wheat and barley 
<A NAME="93"></A>which are the staff of life. The others had ground their task and had gone 
<A NAME="94"></A>to take their rest, but this one had not yet finished, for she was not 
<A NAME="95"></A>so strong as they were, and when she heard the thunder she stopped grinding 
<A NAME="96"></A>and gave the sign to her master. "Father Jove," said she, "you who rule 
<A NAME="97"></A>over heaven and earth, you have thundered from a clear sky without so much 
<A NAME="98"></A>as a cloud in it, and this means something for somebody; grant the prayer, 
<A NAME="99"></A>then, of me your poor servant who calls upon you, and let this be the very 
<A NAME="100"></A>last day that the suitors dine in the house of Ulysses. They have worn 
<A NAME="101"></A>me out with the labour of grinding meal for them, and I hope they may never 
<A NAME="102"></A>have another dinner anywhere at all."
<A NAME="103"></A><BR><BR>Ulysses was glad when he heard the omens conveyed to him by the 
<A NAME="104"></A>woman's speech, and by the thunder, for he knew they meant that he should 
<A NAME="105"></A>avenge himself on the suitors.
<A NAME="106"></A><BR><BR>Then the other maids in the house rose and lit the fire on the 
<A NAME="107"></A>hearth; Telemachus also rose and put on his clothes. He girded his sword 
<A NAME="108"></A>about his shoulder, bound his sandals on his comely feet, and took a doughty 
<A NAME="109"></A>spear with a point of sharpened bronze; then he went to the threshold of 
<A NAME="110"></A>the cloister and said to Euryclea, "Nurse, did you make the stranger comfortable 
<A NAME="111"></A>both as regards bed and board, or did you let him shift for himself?- for 
<A NAME="112"></A>my mother, good woman though she is, has a way of paying great attention 
<A NAME="113"></A>to second-rate people, and of neglecting others who are in reality much 
<A NAME="114"></A>better men."
<A NAME="115"></A><BR><BR>"Do not find fault child," said Euryclea, "when there is no one 
<A NAME="116"></A>to find fault with. The stranger sat and drank his wine as long as he liked: 
<A NAME="117"></A>your mother did ask him if he would take any more bread and he said he 
<A NAME="118"></A>would not. When he wanted to go to bed she told the servants to make one 
<A NAME="119"></A>for him, but he said he was re such wretched outcast that he would not 
<A NAME="120"></A>sleep on a bed and under blankets; he insisted on having an undressed bullock's 
<A NAME="121"></A>hide and some sheepskins put for him in the cloister and I threw a cloak 
<A NAME="122"></A>over him myself."
<A NAME="123"></A><BR><BR>Then Telemachus went out of the court to the place where the Achaeans 
<A NAME="124"></A>were meeting in assembly; he had his spear in his hand, and he was not 
<A NAME="125"></A>alone, for his two dogs went with him. But Euryclea called the maids and 
<A NAME="126"></A>said, "Come, wake up; set about sweeping the cloisters and sprinkling them 
<A NAME="127"></A>with water to lay the dust; put the covers on the seats; wipe down the 
<A NAME="128"></A>tables, some of you, with a wet sponge; clean out the mixing-jugs and the 
<A NAME="129"></A>cups, and for water from the fountain at once; the suitors will be here 
<A NAME="130"></A>directly; they will be here early, for it is a feast 
<A NAME="131"></A>day."
<A NAME="132"></A><BR><BR>Thus did she speak, and they did even as she had said: twenty of 
<A NAME="133"></A>them went to the fountain for water, and the others set themselves busily 
<A NAME="134"></A>to work about the house. The men who were in attendance on the suitors 
<A NAME="135"></A>also came up and began chopping firewood. By and by the women returned 
<A NAME="136"></A>from the fountain, and the swineherd came after them with the three best 
<A NAME="137"></A>pigs he could pick out. These he let feed about the premises, and then 
<A NAME="138"></A>he said good-humouredly to Ulysses, "Stranger, are the suitors treating 
<A NAME="139"></A>you any better now, or are they as insolent as ever?"
<A NAME="140"></A><BR><BR>"May heaven," answered Ulysses, "requite to them the wickedness 
<A NAME="141"></A>with which they deal high-handedly in another man's house without any sense 
<A NAME="142"></A>of shame."
<A NAME="143"></A><BR><BR>Thus did they converse; meanwhile Melanthius the goatherd came 
<A NAME="144"></A>up, for he too was bringing in his best goats for the suitors' dinner; 
<A NAME="145"></A>and he had two shepherds with him. They tied the goats up under the gatehouse, 
<A NAME="146"></A>and then Melanthius began gibing at Ulysses. "Are you still here, stranger," 
<A NAME="147"></A>said he, "to pester people by begging about the house? Why can you not 
<A NAME="148"></A>go elsewhere? You and I shall not come to an understanding before we have 
<A NAME="149"></A>given each other a taste of our fists. You beg without any sense of decency: 
<A NAME="150"></A>are there not feasts elsewhere among the Achaeans, as well as 
<A NAME="151"></A>here?"
<A NAME="152"></A><BR><BR>Ulysses made no answer, but bowed his head and brooded. Then a 
<A NAME="153"></A>third man, Philoetius, joined them, who was bringing in a barren heifer 
<A NAME="154"></A>and some goats. These were brought over by the boatmen who are there to 
<A NAME="155"></A>take people over when any one comes to them. So Philoetius made his heifer 
<A NAME="156"></A>and his goats secure under the gatehouse, and then went up to the swineherd. 
<A NAME="157"></A>"Who, Swineherd," said he, "is this stranger that is lately come here? 
<A NAME="158"></A>Is he one of your men? What is his family? Where does he come from? Poor 
<A NAME="159"></A>fellow, he looks as if he had been some great man, but the gods give sorrow 
<A NAME="160"></A>to whom they will- even to kings if it so pleases them
<A NAME="161"></A><BR><BR>As he spoke he went up to Ulysses and saluted him with his right 
<A NAME="162"></A>hand; "Good day to you, father stranger," said he, "you seem to be very 
<A NAME="163"></A>poorly off now, but I hope you will have better times by and by. Father 
<A NAME="164"></A>Jove, of all gods you are the most malicious. We are your own children, 
<A NAME="165"></A>yet you show us no mercy in all our misery and afflictions. A sweat came 
<A NAME="166"></A>over me when I saw this man, and my eyes filled with tears, for he reminds 
<A NAME="167"></A>me of Ulysses, who I fear is going about in just such rags as this man's 
<A NAME="168"></A>are, if indeed he is still among the living. If he is already dead and 
<A NAME="169"></A>in the house of Hades, then, alas! for my good master, who made me his 
<A NAME="170"></A>stockman when I was quite young among the Cephallenians, and now his cattle 
<A NAME="171"></A>are countless; no one could have done better with them than I have, for 
<A NAME="172"></A>they have bred like ears of corn; nevertheless I have to keep bringing 
<A NAME="173"></A>them in for others to eat, who take no heed of his son though he is in 
<A NAME="174"></A>the house, and fear not the wrath of heaven, but are already eager to divide 
<A NAME="175"></A>Ulysses' property among them because he has been away so long. I have often 
<A NAME="176"></A>thought- only it would not be right while his son is living- of going off 
<A NAME="177"></A>with the cattle to some foreign country; bad as this would be, it is still 
<A NAME="178"></A>harder to stay here and be ill-treated about other people's herds. My position 
<A NAME="179"></A>is intolerable, and I should long since have run away and put myself under 
<A NAME="180"></A>the protection of some other chief, only that I believe my poor master 
<A NAME="181"></A>will yet return, and send all these suitors flying out of the 
<A NAME="182"></A>house."
<A NAME="183"></A><BR><BR>"Stockman," answered Ulysses, "you seem to be a very well-disposed 
<A NAME="184"></A>person, and I can see that you are a man of sense. Therefore I will tell 
<A NAME="185"></A>you, and will confirm my words with an oath: by Jove, the chief of all 
<A NAME="186"></A>gods, and by that hearth of Ulysses to which I am now come, Ulysses shall 
<A NAME="187"></A>return before you leave this place, and if you are so minded you shall 
<A NAME="188"></A>see him killing the suitors who are now masters here."
<A NAME="189"></A><BR><BR>"If Jove were to bring this to pass," replied the stockman, "you 
<A NAME="190"></A>should see how I would do my very utmost to help him."
<A NAME="191"></A><BR><BR>And in like manner Eumaeus prayed that Ulysses might return 
<A NAME="192"></A>home.
<A NAME="193"></A><BR>Thus did they converse. Meanwhile the suitors were hatching a plot 
<A NAME="194"></A>to murder Telemachus: but a bird flew near them on their left hand- an 
<A NAME="195"></A>eagle with a dove in its talons. On this Amphinomus said, "My friends, 
<A NAME="196"></A>this plot of ours to murder Telemachus will not succeed; let us go to dinner 
<A NAME="197"></A>instead."
<A NAME="198"></A><BR><BR>The others assented, so they went inside and laid their cloaks 
<A NAME="199"></A>on the benches and seats. They sacrificed the sheep, goats, pigs, and the 
<A NAME="200"></A>heifer, and when the inward meats were cooked they served them round. They 
<A NAME="201"></A>mixed the wine in the mixing-bowls, and the swineherd gave every man his 
<A NAME="202"></A>cup, while Philoetius handed round the bread in the breadbaskets, and Melanthius 
<A NAME="203"></A>poured them out their wine. Then they laid their hands upon the good things 
<A NAME="204"></A>that were before them.
<A NAME="205"></A><BR><BR>Telemachus purposely made Ulysses sit in the part of the cloister 
<A NAME="206"></A>that was paved with stone; he gave him a shabby-looking seat at a little 
<A NAME="207"></A>table to himself, and had his portion of the inward meats brought to him, 
<A NAME="208"></A>with his wine in a gold cup. "Sit there," said he, "and drink your wine 
<A NAME="209"></A>among the great people. I will put a stop to the gibes and blows of the 
<A NAME="210"></A>suitors, for this is no public house, but belongs to Ulysses, and has passed 
<A NAME="211"></A>from him to me. Therefore, suitors, keep your hands and your tongues to 
<A NAME="212"></A>yourselves, or there will be mischief."
<A NAME="213"></A><BR><BR>The suitors bit their lips, and marvelled at the boldness of his 
<A NAME="214"></A>speech; then Antinous said, "We do not like such language but we will put 
<A NAME="215"></A>up with it, for Telemachus is threatening us in good earnest. If Jove had 
<A NAME="216"></A>let us we should have put a stop to his brave talk ere 
<A NAME="217"></A>now."
<A NAME="218"></A><BR><BR>Thus spoke Antinous, but Telemachus heeded him not. Meanwhile the 
<A NAME="219"></A>heralds were bringing the holy hecatomb through the city, and the Achaeans 
<A NAME="220"></A>gathered under the shady grove of Apollo.
<A NAME="221"></A><BR><BR>Then they roasted the outer meat, drew it off the spits, gave every 
<A NAME="222"></A>man his portion, and feasted to their hearts' content; those who waited 
<A NAME="223"></A>at table gave Ulysses exactly the same portion as the others had, for Telemachus 
<A NAME="224"></A>had told them to do so.
<A NAME="225"></A><BR><BR>But Minerva would not let the suitors for one moment drop their 
<A NAME="226"></A>insolence, for she wanted Ulysses to become still more bitter against them. 
<A NAME="227"></A>Now there happened to be among them a ribald fellow, whose name was Ctesippus, 
<A NAME="228"></A>and who came from Same. This man, confident in his great wealth, was paying 
<A NAME="229"></A>court to the wife of Ulysses, and said to the suitors, "Hear what I have 
<A NAME="230"></A>to say. The stranger has already had as large a portion as any one else; 
<A NAME="231"></A>this is well, for it is not right nor reasonable to ill-treat any guest 
<A NAME="232"></A>of Telemachus who comes here. I will, however, make him a present on my 
<A NAME="233"></A>own account, that he may have something to give to the bath-woman, or to 
<A NAME="234"></A>some other of Ulysses' servants."
<A NAME="235"></A><BR><BR>As he spoke he picked up a heifer's foot from the meat-basket in 
<A NAME="236"></A>which it lay, and threw it at Ulysses, but Ulysses turned his head a little 
<A NAME="237"></A>aside, and avoided it, smiling grimly Sardinian fashion as he did so, and 
<A NAME="238"></A>it hit the wall, not him. On this Telemachus spoke fiercely to Ctesippus, 
<A NAME="239"></A>"It is a good thing for you," said he, "that the stranger turned his head 
<A NAME="240"></A>so that you missed him. If you had hit him I should have run you through 
<A NAME="241"></A>with my spear, and your father would have had to see about getting you 
<A NAME="242"></A>buried rather than married in this house. So let me have no more unseemly 
<A NAME="243"></A>behaviour from any of you, for I am grown up now to the knowledge of good 
<A NAME="244"></A>and evil and understand what is going on, instead of being the child that 
<A NAME="245"></A>I have been heretofore. I have long seen you killing my sheep and making 
<A NAME="246"></A>free with my corn and wine: I have put up with this, for one man is no 
<A NAME="247"></A>match for many, but do me no further violence. Still, if you wish to kill 
<A NAME="248"></A>me, kill me; I would far rather die than see such disgraceful scenes day 
<A NAME="249"></A>after day- guests insulted, and men dragging the women servants about the 
<A NAME="250"></A>house in an unseemly way."
<A NAME="251"></A><BR><BR>They all held their peace till at last Agelaus son of Damastor 
<A NAME="252"></A>said, "No one should take offence at what has just been said, nor gainsay 
<A NAME="253"></A>it, for it is quite reasonable. Leave off, therefore, ill-treating the 
<A NAME="254"></A>stranger, or any one else of the servants who are about the house; I would 
<A NAME="255"></A>say, however, a friendly word to Telemachus and his mother, which I trust 
<A NAME="256"></A>may commend itself to both. 'As long,' I would say, 'as you had ground 
<A NAME="257"></A>for hoping that Ulysses would one day come home, no one could complain 
<A NAME="258"></A>of your waiting and suffering the suitors to be in your house. It would 
<A NAME="259"></A>have been better that he should have returned, but it is now sufficiently 
<A NAME="260"></A>clear that he will never do so; therefore talk all this quietly over with 
<A NAME="261"></A>your mother, and tell her to marry the best man, and the one who makes 
<A NAME="262"></A>her the most advantageous offer. Thus you will yourself be able to manage 
<A NAME="263"></A>your own inheritance, and to eat and drink in peace, while your mother 
<A NAME="264"></A>will look after some other man's house, not yours."'
<A NAME="265"></A><BR><BR>To this Telemachus answered, "By Jove, Agelaus, and by the sorrows 
<A NAME="266"></A>of my unhappy father, who has either perished far from Ithaca, or is wandering 
<A NAME="267"></A>in some distant land, I throw no obstacles in the way of my mother's marriage; 
<A NAME="268"></A>on the contrary I urge her to choose whomsoever she will, and I will give 
<A NAME="269"></A>her numberless gifts into the bargain, but I dare not insist point blank 
<A NAME="270"></A>that she shall leave the house against her own wishes. Heaven forbid that 
<A NAME="271"></A>I should do this."
<A NAME="272"></A><BR><BR>Minerva now made the suitors fall to laughing immoderately, and 
<A NAME="273"></A>set their wits wandering; but they were laughing with a forced laughter. 
<A NAME="274"></A>Their meat became smeared with blood; their eyes filled with tears, and 
<A NAME="275"></A>their hearts were heavy with forebodings. Theoclymenus saw this and said, 
<A NAME="276"></A>"Unhappy men, what is it that ails you? There is a shroud of darkness drawn 
<A NAME="277"></A>over you from head to foot, your cheeks are wet with tears; the air is 
<A NAME="278"></A>alive with wailing voices; the walls and roof-beams drip blood; the gate 
<A NAME="279"></A>of the cloisters and the court beyond them are full of ghosts trooping 
<A NAME="280"></A>down into the night of hell; the sun is blotted out of heaven, and a blighting 
<A NAME="281"></A>gloom is over all the land."
<A NAME="282"></A><BR><BR>Thus did he speak, and they all of them laughed heartily. Eurymachus 
<A NAME="283"></A>then said, "This stranger who has lately come here has lost his senses. 
<A NAME="284"></A>Servants, turn him out into the streets, since he finds it so dark 
<A NAME="285"></A>here."
<A NAME="286"></A><BR><BR>But Theoclymenus said, "Eurymachus, you need not send any one with 
<A NAME="287"></A>me. I have eyes, ears, and a pair of feet of my own, to say nothing of 
<A NAME="288"></A>an understanding mind. I will take these out of the house with me, for 
<A NAME="289"></A>I see mischief overhanging you, from which not one of you men who are insulting 
<A NAME="290"></A>people and plotting ill deeds in the house of Ulysses will be able to 
<A NAME="291"></A>escape."
<A NAME="292"></A><BR><BR>He left the house as he spoke, and went back to Piraeus who gave 
<A NAME="293"></A>him welcome, but the suitors kept looking at one another and provoking 
<A NAME="294"></A>Telemachus fly laughing at the strangers. One insolent fellow said to him, 
<A NAME="295"></A>"Telemachus, you are not happy in your guests; first you have this importunate 
<A NAME="296"></A>tramp, who comes begging bread and wine and has no skill for work or for 
<A NAME="297"></A>hard fighting, but is perfectly useless, and now here is another fellow 
<A NAME="298"></A>who is setting himself up as a prophet. Let me persuade you, for it will 
<A NAME="299"></A>be much better, to put them on board ship and send them off to the Sicels 
<A NAME="300"></A>to sell for what they will bring."
<A NAME="301"></A><BR><BR>Telemachus gave him no heed, but sat silently watching his father, 
<A NAME="302"></A>expecting every moment that he would begin his attack upon the 
<A NAME="303"></A>suitors.
<A NAME="304"></A><BR><BR>Meanwhile the daughter of Icarius, wise Penelope, had had had a 
<A NAME="305"></A>rich seat placed for her facing the court and cloisters, so that she could 
<A NAME="306"></A>hear what every one was saying. The dinner indeed had been prepared amid 
<A NAME="307"></A>merriment; it had been both good and abundant, for they had sacrificed 
<A NAME="308"></A>many victims; but the supper was yet to come, and nothing can be conceived 
<A NAME="309"></A>more gruesome than the meal which a goddess and a brave man were soon to 
<A NAME="310"></A>lay before them- for they had brought their doom upon 
<A NAME="311"></A>themselves.
