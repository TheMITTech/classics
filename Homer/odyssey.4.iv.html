<A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A>They reached the low lying city of Lacedaemon them where they drove straight 
<A NAME="11"></A>to the of abode Menelaus [and found him in his own house, feasting with 
<A NAME="12"></A>his many clansmen in honour of the wedding of his son, and also of his 
<A NAME="13"></A>daughter, whom he was marrying to the son of that valiant warrior Achilles. 
<A NAME="14"></A>He had given his consent and promised her to him while he was still at 
<A NAME="15"></A>Troy, and now the gods were bringing the marriage about; so he was sending 
<A NAME="16"></A>her with chariots and horses to the city of the Myrmidons over whom Achilles' 
<A NAME="17"></A>son was reigning. For his only son he had found a bride from Sparta, daughter 
<A NAME="18"></A>of Alector. This son, Megapenthes, was born to him of a bondwoman, for 
<A NAME="19"></A>heaven vouchsafed Helen no more children after she had borne Hermione, 
<A NAME="20"></A>who was fair as golden Venus herself.
<A NAME="21"></A><BR><BR>So the neighbours and kinsmen of Menelaus were feasting and making 
<A NAME="22"></A>merry in his house. There was a bard also to sing to them and play his 
<A NAME="23"></A>lyre, while two tumblers went about performing in the midst of them when 
<A NAME="24"></A>the man struck up with his tune.]
<A NAME="25"></A><BR><BR>Telemachus and the son of Nestor stayed their horses at the gate, 
<A NAME="26"></A>whereon Eteoneus servant to Menelaus came out, and as soon as he saw them 
<A NAME="27"></A>ran hurrying back into the house to tell his Master. He went close up to 
<A NAME="28"></A>him and said, "Menelaus, there are some strangers come here, two men, who 
<A NAME="29"></A>look like sons of Jove. What are we to do? Shall we take their horses out, 
<A NAME="30"></A>or tell them to find friends elsewhere as they best 
<A NAME="31"></A>can?"
<A NAME="32"></A><BR><BR>Menelaus was very angry and said, "Eteoneus, son of Boethous, you 
<A NAME="33"></A>never used to be a fool, but now you talk like a simpleton. Take their 
<A NAME="34"></A>horses out, of course, and show the strangers in that they may have supper; 
<A NAME="35"></A>you and I have stayed often enough at other people's houses before we got 
<A NAME="36"></A>back here, where heaven grant that we may rest in peace 
<A NAME="37"></A>henceforward."
<A NAME="38"></A><BR><BR>So Eteoneus bustled back and bade other servants come with him. 
<A NAME="39"></A>They took their sweating hands from under the yoke, made them fast to the 
<A NAME="40"></A>mangers, and gave them a feed of oats and barley mixed. Then they leaned 
<A NAME="41"></A>the chariot against the end wall of the courtyard, and led the way into 
<A NAME="42"></A>the house. Telemachus and Pisistratus were astonished when they saw it, 
<A NAME="43"></A>for its splendour was as that of the sun and moon; then, when they had 
<A NAME="44"></A>admired everything to their heart's content, they went into the bath room 
<A NAME="45"></A>and washed themselves.
<A NAME="46"></A><BR><BR>When the servants had washed them and anointed them with oil, they 
<A NAME="47"></A>brought them woollen cloaks and shirts, and the two took their seats by 
<A NAME="48"></A>the side of Menelaus. A maidservant brought them water in a beautiful golden 
<A NAME="49"></A>ewer, and poured it into a silver basin for them to wash their hands; and 
<A NAME="50"></A>she drew a clean table beside them. An upper servant brought them bread, 
<A NAME="51"></A>and offered them many good things of what there was in the house, while 
<A NAME="52"></A>the carver fetched them plates of all manner of meats and set cups of gold 
<A NAME="53"></A>by their side.
<A NAME="54"></A><BR><BR>Menelaus then greeted them saying, "Fall to, and welcome; when 
<A NAME="55"></A>you have done supper I shall ask who you are, for the lineage of such men 
<A NAME="56"></A>as you cannot have been lost. You must be descended from a line of sceptre-bearing 
<A NAME="57"></A>kings, for poor people do not have such sons as you 
<A NAME="58"></A>are."
<A NAME="59"></A><BR><BR>On this he handed them a piece of fat roast loin, which had been 
<A NAME="60"></A>set near him as being a prime part, and they laid their hands on the good 
<A NAME="61"></A>things that were before them; as soon as they had had enough to eat and 
<A NAME="62"></A>drink, Telemachus said to the son of Nestor, with his head so close that 
<A NAME="63"></A>no one might hear, "Look, Pisistratus, man after my own heart, see the 
<A NAME="64"></A>gleam of bronze and gold- of amber, ivory, and silver. Everything is so 
<A NAME="65"></A>splendid that it is like seeing the palace of Olympian Jove. I am lost 
<A NAME="66"></A>in admiration."
<A NAME="67"></A><BR><BR>Menelaus overheard him and said, "No one, my sons, can hold his 
<A NAME="68"></A>own with Jove, for his house and everything about him is immortal; but 
<A NAME="69"></A>among mortal men- well, there may be another who has as much wealth as 
<A NAME="70"></A>I have, or there may not; but at all events I have travelled much and have 
<A NAME="71"></A>undergone much hardship, for it was nearly eight years before I could get 
<A NAME="72"></A>home with my fleet. I went to Cyprus, Phoenicia and the Egyptians; I went 
<A NAME="73"></A>also to the Ethiopians, the Sidonians, and the Erembians, and to Libya 
<A NAME="74"></A>where the lambs have horns as soon as they are born, and the sheep lamb 
<A NAME="75"></A>down three times a year. Every one in that country, whether master or man, 
<A NAME="76"></A>has plenty of cheese, meat, and good milk, for the ewes yield all the year 
<A NAME="77"></A>round. But while I was travelling and getting great riches among these 
<A NAME="78"></A>people, my brother was secretly and shockingly murdered through the perfidy 
<A NAME="79"></A>of his wicked wife, so that I have no pleasure in being lord of all this 
<A NAME="80"></A>wealth. Whoever your parents may be they must have told you about all this, 
<A NAME="81"></A>and of my heavy loss in the ruin of a stately mansion fully and magnificently 
<A NAME="82"></A>furnished. Would that I had only a third of what I now have so that I had 
<A NAME="83"></A>stayed at home, and all those were living who perished on the plain of 
<A NAME="84"></A>Troy, far from Argos. I of grieve, as I sit here in my house, for one and 
<A NAME="85"></A>all of them. At times I cry aloud for sorrow, but presently I leave off 
<A NAME="86"></A>again, for crying is cold comfort and one soon tires of it. Yet grieve 
<A NAME="87"></A>for these as I may, I do so for one man more than for them all. I cannot 
<A NAME="88"></A>even think of him without loathing both food and sleep, so miserable does 
<A NAME="89"></A>he make me, for no one of all the Achaeans worked so hard or risked so 
<A NAME="90"></A>much as he did. He took nothing by it, and has left a legacy of sorrow 
<A NAME="91"></A>to myself, for he has been gone a long time, and we know not whether he 
<A NAME="92"></A>is alive or dead. His old father, his long-suffering wife Penelope, and 
<A NAME="93"></A>his son Telemachus, whom he left behind him an infant in arms, are plunged 
<A NAME="94"></A>in grief on his account."
<A NAME="95"></A><BR><BR>Thus spoke Menelaus, and the heart of Telemachus yearned as he 
<A NAME="96"></A>bethought him of his father. Tears fell from his eyes as he heard him thus 
<A NAME="97"></A>mentioned, so that he held his cloak before his face with both hands. When 
<A NAME="98"></A>Menelaus saw this he doubted whether to let him choose his own time for 
<A NAME="99"></A>speaking, or to ask him at once and find what it was all 
<A NAME="100"></A>about.
<A NAME="101"></A><BR><BR>While he was thus in two minds Helen came down from her high vaulted 
<A NAME="102"></A>and perfumed room, looking as lovely as Diana herself. Adraste brought 
<A NAME="103"></A>her a seat, Alcippe a soft woollen rug while Phylo fetched her the silver 
<A NAME="104"></A>work-box which Alcandra wife of Polybus had given her. Polybus lived in 
<A NAME="105"></A>Egyptian Thebes, which is the richest city in the whole world; he gave 
<A NAME="106"></A>Menelaus two baths, both of pure silver, two tripods, and ten talents of 
<A NAME="107"></A>gold; besides all this, his wife gave Helen some beautiful presents, to 
<A NAME="108"></A>wit, a golden distaff, and a silver work-box that ran on wheels, with a 
<A NAME="109"></A>gold band round the top of it. Phylo now placed this by her side, full 
<A NAME="110"></A>of fine spun yarn, and a distaff charged with violet coloured wool was 
<A NAME="111"></A>laid upon the top of it. Then Helen took her seat, put her feet upon the 
<A NAME="112"></A>footstool, and began to question her husband.
<A NAME="113"></A><BR><BR>"Do we know, Menelaus," said she, "the names of these strangers 
<A NAME="114"></A>who have come to visit us? Shall I guess right or wrong?-but I cannot help 
<A NAME="115"></A>saying what I think. Never yet have I seen either man or woman so like 
<A NAME="116"></A>somebody else (indeed when I look at him I hardly know what to think) as 
<A NAME="117"></A>this young man is like Telemachus, whom Ulysses left as a baby behind him, 
<A NAME="118"></A>when you Achaeans went to Troy with battle in your hearts, on account of 
<A NAME="119"></A>my most shameless self."
<A NAME="120"></A><BR><BR>"My dear wife," replied Menelaus, "I see the likeness just as you 
<A NAME="121"></A>do. His hands and feet are just like Ulysses'; so is his hair, with the 
<A NAME="122"></A>shape of his head and the expression of his eyes. Moreover, when I was 
<A NAME="123"></A>talking about Ulysses, and saying how much he had suffered on my account, 
<A NAME="124"></A>tears fell from his eyes, and he hid his face in his 
<A NAME="125"></A>mantle."
<A NAME="126"></A><BR><BR>Then Pisistratus said, "Menelaus, son of Atreus, you are right 
<A NAME="127"></A>in thinking that this young man is Telemachus, but he is very modest, and 
<A NAME="128"></A>is ashamed to come here and begin opening up discourse with one whose conversation 
<A NAME="129"></A>is so divinely interesting as your own. My father, Nestor, sent me to escort 
<A NAME="130"></A>him hither, for he wanted to know whether you could give him any counsel 
<A NAME="131"></A>or suggestion. A son has always trouble at home when his father has gone 
<A NAME="132"></A>away leaving him without supporters; and this is how Telemachus is now 
<A NAME="133"></A>placed, for his father is absent, and there is no one among his own people 
<A NAME="134"></A>to stand by him."
<A NAME="135"></A><BR><BR>"Bless my heart," replied Menelaus, "then I am receiving a visit 
<A NAME="136"></A>from the son of a very dear friend, who suffered much hardship for my sake. 
<A NAME="137"></A>I had always hoped to entertain him with most marked distinction when heaven 
<A NAME="138"></A>had granted us a safe return from beyond the seas. I should have founded 
<A NAME="139"></A>a city for him in Argos, and built him a house. I should have made him 
<A NAME="140"></A>leave Ithaca with his goods, his son, and all his people, and should have 
<A NAME="141"></A>sacked for them some one of the neighbouring cities that are subject to 
<A NAME="142"></A>me. We should thus have seen one another continually, and nothing but death 
<A NAME="143"></A>could have interrupted so close and happy an intercourse. I suppose, however, 
<A NAME="144"></A>that heaven grudged us such great good fortune, for it has prevented the 
<A NAME="145"></A>poor fellow from ever getting home at all."
<A NAME="146"></A><BR><BR>Thus did he speak, and his words set them all a weeping. Helen 
<A NAME="147"></A>wept, Telemachus wept, and so did Menelaus, nor could Pisistratus keep 
<A NAME="148"></A>his eyes from filling, when he remembered his dear brother Antilochus whom 
<A NAME="149"></A>the son of bright Dawn had killed. Thereon he said to 
<A NAME="150"></A>Menelaus,
<A NAME="151"></A><BR><BR>"Sir, my father Nestor, when we used to talk about you at home, 
<A NAME="152"></A>told me you were a person of rare and excellent understanding. If, then, 
<A NAME="153"></A>it be possible, do as I would urge you. I am not fond of crying while I 
<A NAME="154"></A>am getting my supper. Morning will come in due course, and in the forenoon 
<A NAME="155"></A>I care not how much I cry for those that are dead and gone. This is all 
<A NAME="156"></A>we can do for the poor things. We can only shave our heads for them and 
<A NAME="157"></A>wring the tears from our cheeks. I had a brother who died at Troy; he was 
<A NAME="158"></A>by no means the worst man there; you are sure to have known him- his name 
<A NAME="159"></A>was Antilochus; I never set eyes upon him myself, but they say that he 
<A NAME="160"></A>was singularly fleet of foot and in fight valiant."
<A NAME="161"></A><BR><BR>"Your discretion, my friend," answered Menelaus, "is beyond your 
<A NAME="162"></A>years. It is plain you take after your father. One can soon see when a 
<A NAME="163"></A>man is son to one whom heaven has blessed both as regards wife and offspring- 
<A NAME="164"></A>and it has blessed Nestor from first to last all his days, giving him a 
<A NAME="165"></A>green old age in his own house, with sons about him who are both we disposed 
<A NAME="166"></A>and valiant. We will put an end therefore to all this weeping, and attend 
<A NAME="167"></A>to our supper again. Let water be poured over our hands. Telemachus and 
<A NAME="168"></A>I can talk with one another fully in the morning."
<A NAME="169"></A><BR><BR>On this Asphalion, one of the servants, poured water over their 
<A NAME="170"></A>hands and they laid their hands on the good things that were before 
<A NAME="171"></A>them.
<A NAME="172"></A><BR><BR>Then Jove's daughter Helen bethought her of another matter. She 
<A NAME="173"></A>drugged the wine with an herb that banishes all care, sorrow, and ill humour. 
<A NAME="174"></A>Whoever drinks wine thus drugged cannot shed a single tear all the rest 
<A NAME="175"></A>of the day, not even though his father and mother both of them drop down 
<A NAME="176"></A>dead, or he sees a brother or a son hewn in pieces before his very eyes. 
<A NAME="177"></A>This drug, of such sovereign power and virtue, had been given to Helen 
<A NAME="178"></A>by Polydamna wife of Thon, a woman of Egypt, where there grow all sorts 
<A NAME="179"></A>of herbs, some good to put into the mixing-bowl and others poisonous. Moreover, 
<A NAME="180"></A>every one in the whole country is a skilled physician, for they are of 
<A NAME="181"></A>the race of Paeeon. When Helen had put this drug in the bowl, and had told 
<A NAME="182"></A>the servants to serve the wine round, she said:
<A NAME="183"></A><BR><BR>"Menelaus, son of Atreus, and you my good friends, sons of honourable 
<A NAME="184"></A>men (which is as Jove wills, for he is the giver both of good and evil, 
<A NAME="185"></A>and can do what he chooses), feast here as you will, and listen while I 
<A NAME="186"></A>tell you a tale in season. I cannot indeed name every single one of the 
<A NAME="187"></A>exploits of Ulysses, but I can say what he did when he was before Troy, 
<A NAME="188"></A>and you Achaeans were in all sorts of difficulties. He covered himself 
<A NAME="189"></A>with wounds and bruises, dressed himself all in rags, and entered the enemy's 
<A NAME="190"></A>city looking like a menial or a beggar. and quite different from what he 
<A NAME="191"></A>did when he was among his own people. In this disguise he entered the city 
<A NAME="192"></A>of Troy, and no one said anything to him. I alone recognized him and began 
<A NAME="193"></A>to question him, but he was too cunning for me. When, however, I had washed 
<A NAME="194"></A>and anointed him and had given him clothes, and after I had sworn a solemn 
<A NAME="195"></A>oath not to betray him to the Trojans till he had got safely back to his 
<A NAME="196"></A>own camp and to the ships, he told me all that the Achaeans meant to do. 
<A NAME="197"></A>He killed many Trojans and got much information before he reached the Argive 
<A NAME="198"></A>camp, for all which things the Trojan women made lamentation, but for my 
<A NAME="199"></A>own part I was glad, for my heart was beginning to oam after my home, and 
<A NAME="200"></A>I was unhappy about wrong that Venus had done me in taking me over there, 
<A NAME="201"></A>away from my country, my girl, and my lawful wedded husband, who is indeed 
<A NAME="202"></A>by no means deficient either in person or understanding."
<A NAME="203"></A><BR><BR>Then Menelaus said, "All that you have been saying, my dear wife, 
<A NAME="204"></A>is true. I have travelled much, and have had much to do with heroes, but 
<A NAME="205"></A>I have never seen such another man as Ulysses. What endurance too, and 
<A NAME="206"></A>what courage he displayed within the wooden horse, wherein all the bravest 
<A NAME="207"></A>of the Argives were lying in wait to bring death and destruction upon the 
<A NAME="208"></A>Trojans. At that moment you came up to us; some god who wished well to 
<A NAME="209"></A>the Trojans must have set you on to it and you had Deiphobus with you. 
<A NAME="210"></A>Three times did you go all round our hiding place and pat it; you called 
<A NAME="211"></A>our chiefs each by his own name, and mimicked all our wives -Diomed, Ulysses, 
<A NAME="212"></A>and I from our seats inside heard what a noise you made. Diomed and I could 
<A NAME="213"></A>not make up our minds whether to spring out then and there, or to answer 
<A NAME="214"></A>you from inside, but Ulysses held us all in check, so we sat quite still, 
<A NAME="215"></A>all except Anticlus, who was beginning to answer you, when Ulysses clapped 
<A NAME="216"></A>his two brawny hands over his mouth, and kept them there. It was this that 
<A NAME="217"></A>saved us all, for he muzzled Anticlus till Minerva took you away 
<A NAME="218"></A>again."
<A NAME="219"></A><BR><BR>"How sad," exclaimed Telemachus, "that all this was of no avail 
<A NAME="220"></A>to save him, nor yet his own iron courage. But now, sir, be pleased to 
<A NAME="221"></A>send us all to bed, that we may lie down and enjoy the blessed boon of 
<A NAME="222"></A>sleep."
<A NAME="223"></A><BR><BR>On this Helen told the maid servants to set beds in the room that 
<A NAME="224"></A>was in the gatehouse, and to make them with good red rugs, and spread coverlets 
<A NAME="225"></A>on the top of them with woollen cloaks for the guests to wear. So the maids 
<A NAME="226"></A>went out, carrying a torch, and made the beds, to which a man-servant presently 
<A NAME="227"></A>conducted the strangers. Thus, then, did Telemachus and Pisistratus sleep 
<A NAME="228"></A>there in the forecourt, while the son of Atreus lay in an inner room with 
<A NAME="229"></A>lovely Helen by his side.
<A NAME="230"></A><BR><BR>When the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, Menelaus 
<A NAME="231"></A>rose and dressed himself. He bound his sandals on to his comely feet, girded 
<A NAME="232"></A>his sword about his shoulders, and left his room looking like an immortal 
<A NAME="233"></A>god. Then, taking a seat near Telemachus he said:
<A NAME="234"></A><BR><BR>"And what, Telemachus, has led you to take this long sea voyage 
<A NAME="235"></A>to Lacedaemon? Are you on public or private business? Tell me all about 
<A NAME="236"></A>it."
<A NAME="237"></A><BR><BR>"I have come, sir replied Telemachus, "to see if you can tell me 
<A NAME="238"></A>anything about my father. I am being eaten out of house and home; my fair 
<A NAME="239"></A>estate is being wasted, and my house is full of miscreants who keep killing 
<A NAME="240"></A>great numbers of my sheep and oxen, on the pretence of paying their addresses 
<A NAME="241"></A>to my mother. Therefore, I am suppliant at your knees if haply you may 
<A NAME="242"></A>tell me about my father's melancholy end, whether you saw it with your 
<A NAME="243"></A>own eyes, or heard it from some other traveller; for he was a man born 
<A NAME="244"></A>to trouble. Do not soften things out of any pity for myself, but tell me 
<A NAME="245"></A>in all plainness exactly what you saw. If my brave father Ulysses ever 
<A NAME="246"></A>did you loyal service either by word or deed, when you Achaeans were harassed 
<A NAME="247"></A>by the Trojans, bear it in mind now as in my favour and tell me truly 
<A NAME="248"></A>all."
<A NAME="249"></A><BR><BR>Menelaus on hearing this was very much shocked. "So," he exclaimed, 
<A NAME="250"></A>"these cowards would usurp a brave man's bed? A hind might as well lay 
<A NAME="251"></A>her new born young in the lair of a lion, and then go off to feed in the 
<A NAME="252"></A>forest or in some grassy dell: the lion when he comes back to his lair 
<A NAME="253"></A>will make short work with the pair of them- and so will Ulysses with these 
<A NAME="254"></A>suitors. By father Jove, Minerva, and Apollo, if Ulysses is still the man 
<A NAME="255"></A>that he was when he wrestled with Philomeleides in Lesbos, and threw him 
<A NAME="256"></A>so heavily that all the Achaeans cheered him- if he is still such and were 
<A NAME="257"></A>to come near these suitors, they would have a short shrift and a sorry 
<A NAME="258"></A>wedding. As regards your questions, however, I will not prevaricate nor 
<A NAME="259"></A>deceive you, but will tell you without concealment all that the old man 
<A NAME="260"></A>of the sea told me.
<A NAME="261"></A><BR><BR>"I was trying to come on here, but the gods detained me in Egypt, 
<A NAME="262"></A>for my hecatombs had not given them full satisfaction, and the gods are 
<A NAME="263"></A>very strict about having their dues. Now off Egypt, about as far as a ship 
<A NAME="264"></A>can sail in a day with a good stiff breeze behind her, there is an island 
<A NAME="265"></A>called Pharos- it has a good harbour from which vessels can get out into 
<A NAME="266"></A>open sea when they have taken in water- and the gods becalmed me twenty 
<A NAME="267"></A>days without so much as a breath of fair wind to help me forward. We should 
<A NAME="268"></A>have run clean out of provisions and my men would have starved, if a goddess 
<A NAME="269"></A>had not taken pity upon me and saved me in the person of Idothea, daughter 
<A NAME="270"></A>to Proteus, the old man of the sea, for she had taken a great fancy to 
<A NAME="271"></A>me.
<A NAME="272"></A><BR><BR>"She came to me one day when I was by myself, as I often was, for 
<A NAME="273"></A>the men used to go with their barbed hooks, all over the island in the 
<A NAME="274"></A>hope of catching a fish or two to save them from the pangs of hunger. 'Stranger,' 
<A NAME="275"></A>said she, 'it seems to me that you like starving in this way- at any rate 
<A NAME="276"></A>it does not greatly trouble you, for you stick here day after day, without 
<A NAME="277"></A>even trying to get away though your men are dying by 
<A NAME="278"></A>inches.'
<A NAME="279"></A><BR><BR>"'Let me tell you,' said I, 'whichever of the goddesses you may 
<A NAME="280"></A>happen to be, that I am not staying here of my own accord, but must have 
<A NAME="281"></A>offended the gods that live in heaven. Tell me, therefore, for the gods 
<A NAME="282"></A>know everything. which of the immortals it is that is hindering me in this 
<A NAME="283"></A>way, and tell me also how I may sail the sea so as to reach my 
<A NAME="284"></A>home.'
<A NAME="285"></A><BR><BR>"'Stranger,' replied she, 'I will make it all quite clear to you. 
<A NAME="286"></A>There is an old immortal who lives under the sea hereabouts and whose name 
<A NAME="287"></A>is Proteus. He is an Egyptian, and people say he is my father; he is Neptune's 
<A NAME="288"></A>head man and knows every inch of ground all over the bottom of the sea. 
<A NAME="289"></A>If you can snare him and hold him tight, he will tell you about your voyage, 
<A NAME="290"></A>what courses you are to take, and how you are to sail the sea so as to 
<A NAME="291"></A>reach your home. He will also tell you, if you so will, all that has been 
<A NAME="292"></A>going on at your house both good and bad, while you have been away on your 
<A NAME="293"></A>long and dangerous journey.'
<A NAME="294"></A><BR><BR>"'Can you show me,' said I, 'some stratagem by means of which I 
<A NAME="295"></A>may catch this old god without his suspecting it and finding me out? For 
<A NAME="296"></A>a god is not easily caught- not by a mortal man.'
<A NAME="297"></A><BR><BR>"'Stranger,' said she, 'I will make it all quite clear to you. 
<A NAME="298"></A>About the time when the sun shall have reached mid heaven, the old man 
<A NAME="299"></A>of the sea comes up from under the waves, heralded by the West wind that 
<A NAME="300"></A>furs the water over his head. As soon as he has come up he lies down, and 
<A NAME="301"></A>goes to sleep in a great sea cave, where the seals- Halosydne's chickens 
<A NAME="302"></A>as they call them- come up also from the grey sea, and go to sleep in shoals 
<A NAME="303"></A>all round him; and a very strong and fish-like smell do they bring with 
<A NAME="304"></A>them. Early to-morrow morning I will take you to this place and will lay 
<A NAME="305"></A>you in ambush. Pick out, therefore, the three best men you have in your 
<A NAME="306"></A>fleet, and I will tell you all the tricks that the old man will play 
<A NAME="307"></A>you.
<A NAME="308"></A><BR><BR>"'First he will look over all his seals, and count them; then, 
<A NAME="309"></A>when he has seen them and tallied them on his five fingers, he will go 
<A NAME="310"></A>to sleep among them, as a shepherd among his sheep. The moment you see 
<A NAME="311"></A>that he is asleep seize him; put forth all your strength and hold him fast, 
<A NAME="312"></A>for he will do his very utmost to get away from you. He will turn himself 
<A NAME="313"></A>into every kind of creature that goes upon the earth, and will become also 
<A NAME="314"></A>both fire and water; but you must hold him fast and grip him tighter and 
<A NAME="315"></A>tighter, till he begins to talk to you and comes back to what he was when 
<A NAME="316"></A>you saw him go to sleep; then you may slacken your hold and let him go; 
<A NAME="317"></A>and you can ask him which of the gods it is that is angry with you, and 
<A NAME="318"></A>what you must do to reach your home over the seas.'
<A NAME="319"></A><BR><BR>"Having so said she dived under the waves, whereon I turned back 
<A NAME="320"></A>to the place where my ships were ranged upon the shore; and my heart was 
<A NAME="321"></A>clouded with care as I went along. When I reached my ship we got supper 
<A NAME="322"></A>ready, for night was falling, and camped down upon the 
<A NAME="323"></A>beach.
<A NAME="324"></A><BR><BR>"When the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, I took 
<A NAME="325"></A>the three men on whose prowess of all kinds I could most rely, and went 
<A NAME="326"></A>along by the sea-side, praying heartily to heaven. Meanwhile the goddess 
<A NAME="327"></A>fetched me up four seal skins from the bottom of the sea, all of them just 
<A NAME="328"></A>skinned, for she meant playing a trick upon her father. Then she dug four 
<A NAME="329"></A>pits for us to lie in, and sat down to wait till we should come up. When 
<A NAME="330"></A>we were close to her, she made us lie down in the pits one after the other, 
<A NAME="331"></A>and threw a seal skin over each of us. Our ambuscade would have been intolerable, 
<A NAME="332"></A>for the stench of the fishy seals was most distressing- who would go to 
<A NAME="333"></A>bed with a sea monster if he could help it?-but here, too, the goddess 
<A NAME="334"></A>helped us, and thought of something that gave us great relief, for she 
<A NAME="335"></A>put some ambrosia under each man's nostrils, which was so fragrant that 
<A NAME="336"></A>it killed the smell of the seals.
<A NAME="337"></A><BR><BR>"We waited the whole morning and made the best of it, watching 
<A NAME="338"></A>the seals come up in hundreds to bask upon the sea shore, till at noon 
<A NAME="339"></A>the old man of the sea came up too, and when he had found his fat seals 
<A NAME="340"></A>he went over them and counted them. We were among the first he counted, 
<A NAME="341"></A>and he never suspected any guile, but laid himself down to sleep as soon 
<A NAME="342"></A>as he had done counting. Then we rushed upon him with a shout and seized 
<A NAME="343"></A>him; on which he began at once with his old tricks, and changed himself 
<A NAME="344"></A>first into a lion with a great mane; then all of a sudden he became a dragon, 
<A NAME="345"></A>a leopard, a wild boar; the next moment he was running water, and then 
<A NAME="346"></A>again directly he was a tree, but we stuck to him and never lost hold, 
<A NAME="347"></A>till at last the cunning old creature became distressed, and said, Which 
<A NAME="348"></A>of the gods was it, Son of Atreus, that hatched this plot with you for 
<A NAME="349"></A>snaring me and seizing me against my will? What do you 
<A NAME="350"></A>want?'
<A NAME="351"></A><BR><BR>"'You know that yourself, old man,' I answered, 'you will gain 
<A NAME="352"></A>nothing by trying to put me off. It is because I have been kept so long 
<A NAME="353"></A>in this island, and see no sign of my being able to get away. I am losing 
<A NAME="354"></A>all heart; tell me, then, for you gods know everything, which of the immortals 
<A NAME="355"></A>it is that is hindering me, and tell me also how I may sail the sea so 
<A NAME="356"></A>as to reach my home?'
<A NAME="357"></A><BR><BR>"Then,' he said, 'if you would finish your voyage and get home 
<A NAME="358"></A>quickly, you must offer sacrifices to Jove and to the rest of the gods 
<A NAME="359"></A>before embarking; for it is decreed that you shall not get back to your 
<A NAME="360"></A>friends, and to your own house, till you have returned to the heaven fed 
<A NAME="361"></A>stream of Egypt, and offered holy hecatombs to the immortal gods that reign 
<A NAME="362"></A>in heaven. When you have done this they will let you finish your 
<A NAME="363"></A>voyage.'
<A NAME="364"></A><BR><BR>"I was broken hearted when I heard that I must go back all that 
<A NAME="365"></A>long and terrible voyage to Egypt; nevertheless, I answered, 'I will do 
<A NAME="366"></A>all, old man, that you have laid upon me; but now tell me, and tell me 
<A NAME="367"></A>true, whether all the Achaeans whom Nestor and I left behind us when we 
<A NAME="368"></A>set sail from Troy have got home safely, or whether any one of them came 
<A NAME="369"></A>to a bad end either on board his own ship or among his friends when the 
<A NAME="370"></A>days of his fighting were done.'
<A NAME="371"></A><BR><BR>"'Son of Atreus,' he answered, 'why ask me? You had better not 
<A NAME="372"></A>know what I can tell you, for your eyes will surely fill when you have 
<A NAME="373"></A>heard my story. Many of those about whom you ask are dead and gone, but 
<A NAME="374"></A>many still remain, and only two of the chief men among the Achaeans perished 
<A NAME="375"></A>during their return home. As for what happened on the field of battle- 
<A NAME="376"></A>you were there yourself. A third Achaean leader is still at sea, alive, 
<A NAME="377"></A>but hindered from returning. Ajax was wrecked, for Neptune drove him on 
<A NAME="378"></A>to the great rocks of Gyrae; nevertheless, he let him get safe out of the 
<A NAME="379"></A>water, and in spite of all Minerva's hatred he would have escaped death, 
<A NAME="380"></A>if he had not ruined himself by boasting. He said the gods could not drown 
<A NAME="381"></A>him even though they had tried to do so, and when Neptune heard this large 
<A NAME="382"></A>talk, he seized his trident in his two brawny hands, and split the rock 
<A NAME="383"></A>of Gyrae in two pieces. The base remained where it was, but the part on 
<A NAME="384"></A>which Ajax was sitting fell headlong into the sea and carried Ajax with 
<A NAME="385"></A>it; so he drank salt water and was drowned.
<A NAME="386"></A><BR><BR>"'Your brother and his ships escaped, for Juno protected him, but 
<A NAME="387"></A>when he was just about to reach the high promontory of Malea, he was caught 
<A NAME="388"></A>by a heavy gale which carried him out to sea again sorely against his will, 
<A NAME="389"></A>and drove him to the foreland where Thyestes used to dwell, but where Aegisthus 
<A NAME="390"></A>was then living. By and by, however, it seemed as though he was to return 
<A NAME="391"></A>safely after all, for the gods backed the wind into its old quarter and 
<A NAME="392"></A>they reached home; whereon Agamemnon kissed his native soil, and shed tears 
<A NAME="393"></A>of joy at finding himself in his own country.
<A NAME="394"></A><BR><BR>"'Now there was a watchman whom Aegisthus kept always on the watch, 
<A NAME="395"></A>and to whom he had promised two talents of gold. This man had been looking 
<A NAME="396"></A>out for a whole year to make sure that Agamemnon did not give him the slip 
<A NAME="397"></A>and prepare war; when, therefore, this man saw Agamemnon go by, he went 
<A NAME="398"></A>and told Aegisthus who at once began to lay a plot for him. He picked twenty 
<A NAME="399"></A>of his bravest warriors and placed them in ambuscade on one side the cloister, 
<A NAME="400"></A>while on the opposite side he prepared a banquet. Then he sent his chariots 
<A NAME="401"></A>and horsemen to Agamemnon, and invited him to the feast, but he meant foul 
<A NAME="402"></A>play. He got him there, all unsuspicious of the doom that was awaiting 
<A NAME="403"></A>him, and killed him when the banquet was over as though he were butchering 
<A NAME="404"></A>an ox in the shambles; not one of Agamemnon's followers was left alive, 
<A NAME="405"></A>nor yet one of Aegisthus', but they were all killed there in the 
<A NAME="406"></A>cloisters.'
<A NAME="407"></A><BR><BR>"Thus spoke Proteus, and I was broken hearted as I heard him. I 
<A NAME="408"></A>sat down upon the sands and wept; I felt as though I could no longer bear 
<A NAME="409"></A>to live nor look upon the light of the sun. Presently, when I had had my 
<A NAME="410"></A>fill of weeping and writhing upon the ground, the old man of the sea said, 
<A NAME="411"></A>'Son of Atreus, do not waste any more time in crying so bitterly; it can 
<A NAME="412"></A>do no manner of good; find your way home as fast as ever you can, for Aegisthus 
<A NAME="413"></A>be still alive, and even though Orestes has beforehand with you in kilting 
<A NAME="414"></A>him, you may yet come in for his funeral.'
<A NAME="415"></A><BR><BR>"On this I took comfort in spite of all my sorrow, and said, 'I 
<A NAME="416"></A>know, then, about these two; tell me, therefore, about the third man of 
<A NAME="417"></A>whom you spoke; is he still alive, but at sea, and unable to get home? 
<A NAME="418"></A>or is he dead? Tell me, no matter how much it may grieve 
<A NAME="419"></A>me.'
<A NAME="420"></A><BR><BR>"'The third man,' he answered, 'is Ulysses who dwells in Ithaca. 
<A NAME="421"></A>I can see him in an island sorrowing bitterly in the house of the nymph 
<A NAME="422"></A>Calypso, who is keeping him prisoner, and he cannot reach his home for 
<A NAME="423"></A>he has no ships nor sailors to take him over the sea. As for your own end, 
<A NAME="424"></A>Menelaus, you shall not die in Argos, but the gods will take you to the 
<A NAME="425"></A>Elysian plain, which is at the ends of the world. There fair-haired Rhadamanthus 
<A NAME="426"></A>reigns, and men lead an easier life than any where else in the world, for 
<A NAME="427"></A>in Elysium there falls not rain, nor hail, nor snow, but Oceanus breathes 
<A NAME="428"></A>ever with a West wind that sings softly from the sea, and gives fresh life 
<A NAME="429"></A>to all men. This will happen to you because you have married Helen, and 
<A NAME="430"></A>are Jove's son-in-law.'
<A NAME="431"></A><BR><BR>"As he spoke he dived under the waves, whereon I turned back to 
<A NAME="432"></A>the ships with my companions, and my heart was clouded with care as I went 
<A NAME="433"></A>along. When we reached the ships we got supper ready, for night was falling, 
<A NAME="434"></A>and camped down upon the beach. When the child of morning, rosy-fingered 
<A NAME="435"></A>Dawn appeared, we drew our ships into the water, and put our masts and 
<A NAME="436"></A>sails within them; then we went on board ourselves, took our seats on the 
<A NAME="437"></A>benches, and smote the grey sea with our oars. I again stationed my ships 
<A NAME="438"></A>in the heaven-fed stream of Egypt, and offered hecatombs that were full 
<A NAME="439"></A>and sufficient. When I had thus appeased heaven's anger, I raised a barrow 
<A NAME="440"></A>to the memory of Agamemnon that his name might live for ever, after which 
<A NAME="441"></A>I had a quick passage home, for the gods sent me a fair 
<A NAME="442"></A>wind.
<A NAME="443"></A><BR><BR>"And now for yourself- stay here some ten or twelve days longer, 
<A NAME="444"></A>and I will then speed you on your way. I will make you a noble present 
<A NAME="445"></A>of a chariot and three horses. I will also give you a beautiful chalice 
<A NAME="446"></A>that so long as you live you may think of me whenever you make a drink-offering 
<A NAME="447"></A>to the immortal gods."
<A NAME="448"></A><BR><BR>"Son of Atreus," replied Telemachus, "do not press me to stay longer; 
<A NAME="449"></A>I should be contented to remain with you for another twelve months; I find 
<A NAME="450"></A>your conversation so delightful that I should never once wish myself at 
<A NAME="451"></A>home with my parents; but my crew whom I have left at Pylos are already 
<A NAME="452"></A>impatient, and you are detaining me from them. As for any present you may 
<A NAME="453"></A>be disposed to make me, I had rather that it should he a piece of plate. 
<A NAME="454"></A>I will take no horses back with me to Ithaca, but will leave them to adorn 
<A NAME="455"></A>your own stables, for you have much flat ground in your kingdom where lotus 
<A NAME="456"></A>thrives, as also meadowsweet and wheat and barley, and oats with their 
<A NAME="457"></A>white and spreading ears; whereas in Ithaca we have neither open fields 
<A NAME="458"></A>nor racecourses, and the country is more fit for goats than horses, and 
<A NAME="459"></A>I like it the better for that. None of our islands have much level ground, 
<A NAME="460"></A>suitable for horses, and Ithaca least of all."
<A NAME="461"></A><BR><BR>Menelaus smiled and took Telemachus's hand within his own. "What 
<A NAME="462"></A>you say," said he, "shows that you come of good family. I both can, and 
<A NAME="463"></A>will, make this exchange for you, by giving you the finest and most precious 
<A NAME="464"></A>piece of plate in all my house. It is a mixing-bowl by Vulcan's own hand, 
<A NAME="465"></A>of pure silver, except the rim, which is inlaid with gold. Phaedimus, king 
<A NAME="466"></A>of the Sidonians, gave it me in the course of a visit which I paid him 
<A NAME="467"></A>when I returned thither on my homeward journey. I will make you a present 
<A NAME="468"></A>of it."
<A NAME="469"></A><BR><BR>Thus did they converse [and guests kept coming to the king's house. 
<A NAME="470"></A>They brought sheep and wine, while their wives had put up bread for them 
<A NAME="471"></A>to take with them; so they were busy cooking their dinners in the 
<A NAME="472"></A>courts].
<A NAME="473"></A><BR><BR>Meanwhile the suitors were throwing discs or aiming with spears 
<A NAME="474"></A>at a mark on the levelled ground in front of Ulysses' house, and were behaving 
<A NAME="475"></A>with all their old insolence. Antinous and Eurymachus, who were their ringleaders 
<A NAME="476"></A>and much the foremost among them all, were sitting together when Noemon 
<A NAME="477"></A>son of Phronius came up and said to Antinous,
<A NAME="478"></A><BR><BR>"Have we any idea, Antinous, on what day Telemachus returns from 
<A NAME="479"></A>Pylos? He has a ship of mine, and I want it, to cross over to Elis: I have 
<A NAME="480"></A>twelve brood mares there with yearling mule foals by their side not yet 
<A NAME="481"></A>broken in, and I want to bring one of them over here and break 
<A NAME="482"></A>him."
<A NAME="483"></A><BR><BR>They were astounded when they heard this, for they had made sure 
<A NAME="484"></A>that Telemachus had not gone to the city of Neleus. They thought he was 
<A NAME="485"></A>only away somewhere on the farms, and was with the sheep, or with the swineherd; 
<A NAME="486"></A>so Antinous said, "When did he go? Tell me truly, and what young men did 
<A NAME="487"></A>he take with him? Were they freemen or his own bondsmen- for he might manage 
<A NAME="488"></A>that too? Tell me also, did you let him have the ship of your own free 
<A NAME="489"></A>will because he asked you, or did he take it without 
<A NAME="490"></A>yourleave?"
<A NAME="491"></A><BR><BR>"I lent it him," answered Noemon, "what else could I do when a 
<A NAME="492"></A>man of his position said he was in a difficulty, and asked me to oblige 
<A NAME="493"></A>him? I could not possibly refuse. As for those who went with him they were 
<A NAME="494"></A>the best young men we have, and I saw Mentor go on board as captain- or 
<A NAME="495"></A>some god who was exactly like him. I cannot understand it, for I saw Mentor 
<A NAME="496"></A>here myself yesterday morning, and yet he was then setting out for 
<A NAME="497"></A>Pylos."
<A NAME="498"></A><BR><BR>Noemon then went back to his father's house, but Antinous and Eurymachus 
<A NAME="499"></A>were very angry. They told the others to leave off playing, and to come 
<A NAME="500"></A>and sit down along with themselves. When they came, Antinous son of Eupeithes 
<A NAME="501"></A>spoke in anger. His heart was black with rage, and his eyes flashed fire 
<A NAME="502"></A>as he said:
<A NAME="503"></A><BR><BR>"Good heavens, this voyage of Telemachus is a very serious matter; 
<A NAME="504"></A>we had made sure that it would come to nothing, but the young fellow has 
<A NAME="505"></A>got away in spite of us, and with a picked crew too. He will be giving 
<A NAME="506"></A>us trouble presently; may Jove take him before he is full grown. Find me 
<A NAME="507"></A>a ship, therefore, with a crew of twenty men, and I will lie in wait for 
<A NAME="508"></A>him in the straits between Ithaca and Samos; he will then rue the day that 
<A NAME="509"></A>he set out to try and get news of his father."
<A NAME="510"></A><BR><BR>Thus did he speak, and the others applauded his saying; they then 
<A NAME="511"></A>all of them went inside the buildings.
<A NAME="512"></A><BR><BR>It was not long ere Penelope came to know what the suitors were 
<A NAME="513"></A>plotting; for a man servant, Medon, overheard them from outside the outer 
<A NAME="514"></A>court as they were laying their schemes within, and went to tell his mistress. 
<A NAME="515"></A>As he crossed the threshold of her room Penelope said: "Medon, what have 
<A NAME="516"></A>the suitors sent you here for? Is it to tell the maids to leave their master's 
<A NAME="517"></A>business and cook dinner for them? I wish they may neither woo nor dine 
<A NAME="518"></A>henceforward, neither here nor anywhere else, but let this be the very 
<A NAME="519"></A>last time, for the waste you all make of my son's estate. Did not your 
<A NAME="520"></A>fathers tell you when you were children how good Ulysses had been to them- 
<A NAME="521"></A>never doing anything high-handed, nor speaking harshly to anybody? Kings 
<A NAME="522"></A>may say things sometimes, and they may take a fancy to one man and dislike 
<A NAME="523"></A>another, but Ulysses never did an unjust thing by anybody- which shows 
<A NAME="524"></A>what bad hearts you have, and that there is no such thing as gratitude 
<A NAME="525"></A>left in this world."
<A NAME="526"></A><BR><BR>Then Medon said, "I wish, Madam, that this were all; but they are 
<A NAME="527"></A>plotting something much more dreadful now- may heaven frustrate their design. 
<A NAME="528"></A>They are going to try and murder Telemachus as he is coming home from Pylos 
<A NAME="529"></A>and Lacedaemon, where he has been to get news of his 
<A NAME="530"></A>father."
<A NAME="531"></A><BR><BR>Then Penelope's heart sank within her, and for a long time she 
<A NAME="532"></A>was speechless; her eyes filled with tears, and she could find no utterance. 
<A NAME="533"></A>At last, however, she said, "Why did my son leave me? What business had 
<A NAME="534"></A>he to go sailing off in ships that make long voyages over the ocean like 
<A NAME="535"></A>sea-horses? Does he want to die without leaving any one behind him to keep 
<A NAME="536"></A>up his name?"
<A NAME="537"></A><BR><BR>"I do not know," answered Medon, "whether some god set him on to 
<A NAME="538"></A>it, or whether he went on his own impulse to see if he could find out if 
<A NAME="539"></A>his father was dead, or alive and on his way home."
<A NAME="540"></A><BR><BR>Then he went downstairs again, leaving Penelope in an agony of 
<A NAME="541"></A>grief. There were plenty of seats in the house, but she. had no heart for 
<A NAME="542"></A>sitting on any one of them; she could only fling herself on the floor of 
<A NAME="543"></A>her own room and cry; whereon all the maids in the house, both old and 
<A NAME="544"></A>young, gathered round her and began to cry too, till at last in a transport 
<A NAME="545"></A>of sorrow she exclaimed,
<A NAME="546"></A><BR><BR>"My dears, heaven has been pleased to try me with more affliction 
<A NAME="547"></A>than any other woman of my age and country. First I lost my brave and lion-hearted 
<A NAME="548"></A>husband, who had every good quality under heaven, and whose name was great 
<A NAME="549"></A>over all Hellas and middle Argos, and now my darling son is at the mercy 
<A NAME="550"></A>of the winds and waves, without my having heard one word about his leaving 
<A NAME="551"></A>home. You hussies, there was not one of you would so much as think of giving 
<A NAME="552"></A>me a call out of my bed, though you all of you very well knew when he was 
<A NAME="553"></A>starting. If I had known he meant taking this voyage, he would have had 
<A NAME="554"></A>to give it up, no matter how much he was bent upon it, or leave me a corpse 
<A NAME="555"></A>behind him- one or other. Now, however, go some of you and call old Dolius, 
<A NAME="556"></A>who was given me by my father on my marriage, and who is my gardener. Bid 
<A NAME="557"></A>him go at once and tell everything to Laertes, who may be able to hit on 
<A NAME="558"></A>some plan for enlisting public sympathy on our side, as against those who 
<A NAME="559"></A>are trying to exterminate his own race and that of Ulysses."
<A NAME="560"></A><BR><BR>Then the dear old nurse Euryclea said, "You may kill me, Madam, 
<A NAME="561"></A>or let me live on in your house, whichever you please, but I will tell 
<A NAME="562"></A>you the real truth. I knew all about it, and gave him everything he wanted 
<A NAME="563"></A>in the way of bread and wine, but he made me take my solemn oath that I 
<A NAME="564"></A>would not tell you anything for some ten or twelve days, unless you asked 
<A NAME="565"></A>or happened to hear of his having gone, for he did not want you to spoil 
<A NAME="566"></A>your beauty by crying. And now, Madam, wash your face, change your dress, 
<A NAME="567"></A>and go upstairs with your maids to offer prayers to Minerva, daughter of 
<A NAME="568"></A>Aegis-bearing Jove, for she can save him even though he be in the jaws 
<A NAME="569"></A>of death. Do not trouble Laertes: he has trouble enough already. Besides, 
<A NAME="570"></A>I cannot think that the gods hate die race of the race of the son of Arceisius 
<A NAME="571"></A>so much, but there will be a son left to come up after him, and inherit 
<A NAME="572"></A>both the house and the fair fields that lie far all round 
<A NAME="573"></A>it."
<A NAME="574"></A><BR><BR>With these words she made her mistress leave off crying, and dried 
<A NAME="575"></A>the tears from her eyes. Penelope washed her face, changed her dress, and 
<A NAME="576"></A>went upstairs with her maids. She then put some bruised barley into a basket 
<A NAME="577"></A>and began praying to Minerva.
<A NAME="578"></A><BR><BR>"Hear me," she cried, "Daughter of Aegis-bearing Jove, unweariable. 
<A NAME="579"></A>If ever Ulysses while he was here burned you fat thigh bones of sheep or 
<A NAME="580"></A>heifer, bear it in mind now as in my favour, and save my darling son from 
<A NAME="581"></A>the villainy of the suitors."
<A NAME="582"></A><BR><BR>She cried aloud as she spoke, and the goddess heard her prayer; 
<A NAME="583"></A>meanwhile the suitors were clamorous throughout the covered cloister, and 
<A NAME="584"></A>one of them said:
<A NAME="585"></A><BR><BR>"The queen is preparing for her marriage with one or other of us. 
<A NAME="586"></A>Little does she dream that her son has now been doomed to 
<A NAME="587"></A>die."
<A NAME="588"></A><BR><BR>This was what they said, but they did not know what was going to 
<A NAME="589"></A>happen. Then Antinous said, "Comrades, let there be no loud talking, lest 
<A NAME="590"></A>some of it get carried inside. Let us be up and do that in silence, about 
<A NAME="591"></A>which we are all of a mind."
<A NAME="592"></A><BR><BR>He then chose twenty men, and they went down to their. ship and 
<A NAME="593"></A>to the sea side; they drew the vessel into the water and got her mast and 
<A NAME="594"></A>sails inside her; they bound the oars to the thole-pins with twisted thongs 
<A NAME="595"></A>of leather, all in due course, and spread the white sails aloft, while 
<A NAME="596"></A>their fine servants brought them their armour. Then they made the ship 
<A NAME="597"></A>fast a little way out, came on shore again, got their suppers, and waited 
<A NAME="598"></A>till night should fall.
<A NAME="599"></A><BR><BR>But Penelope lay in her own room upstairs unable to eat or drink, 
<A NAME="600"></A>and wondering whether her brave son would escape, or be overpowered by 
<A NAME="601"></A>the wicked suitors. Like a lioness caught in the toils with huntsmen hemming 
<A NAME="602"></A>her in on every side she thought and thought till she sank into a slumber, 
<A NAME="603"></A>and lay on her bed bereft of thought and motion.
<A NAME="604"></A><BR><BR>Then Minerva bethought her of another matter, and made a vision 
<A NAME="605"></A>in the likeness of Penelope's sister Iphthime daughter of Icarius who had 
<A NAME="606"></A>married Eumelus and lived in Pherae. She told the vision to go to the house 
<A NAME="607"></A>of Ulysses, and to make Penelope leave off crying, so it came into her 
<A NAME="608"></A>room by the hole through which the thong went for pulling the door to, 
<A NAME="609"></A>and hovered over her head, saying,
<A NAME="610"></A><BR><BR>"You are asleep, Penelope: the gods who live at ease will not suffer 
<A NAME="611"></A>you to weep and be so sad. Your son has done them no wrong, so he will 
<A NAME="612"></A>yet come back to you."
<A NAME="613"></A><BR><BR>Penelope, who was sleeping sweetly at the gates of dreamland, answered, 
<A NAME="614"></A>"Sister, why have you come here? You do not come very often, but I suppose 
<A NAME="615"></A>that is because you live such a long way off. Am I, then, to leave off 
<A NAME="616"></A>crying and refrain from all the sad thoughts that torture me? I, who have 
<A NAME="617"></A>lost my brave and lion-hearted husband, who had every good quality under 
<A NAME="618"></A>heaven, and whose name was great over all Hellas and middle Argos; and 
<A NAME="619"></A>now my darling son has gone off on board of a ship- a foolish fellow who 
<A NAME="620"></A>has never been used to roughing it, nor to going about among gatherings 
<A NAME="621"></A>of men. I am even more anxious about him than about my husband; I am all 
<A NAME="622"></A>in a tremble when I think of him, lest something should happen to him, 
<A NAME="623"></A>either from the people among whom he has gone, or by sea, for he has many 
<A NAME="624"></A>enemies who are plotting against him, and are bent on killing him before 
<A NAME="625"></A>he can return home."
<A NAME="626"></A><BR><BR>Then the vision said, "Take heart, and be not so much dismayed. 
<A NAME="627"></A>There is one gone with him whom many a man would be glad enough to have 
<A NAME="628"></A>stand by his side, I mean Minerva; it is she who has compassion upon you, 
<A NAME="629"></A>and who has sent me to bear you this message."
<A NAME="630"></A><BR><BR>"Then," said Penelope, "if you are a god or have been sent here 
<A NAME="631"></A>by divine commission, tell me also about that other unhappy one- is he 
<A NAME="632"></A>still alive, or is he already dead and in the house of 
<A NAME="633"></A>Hades?"
<A NAME="634"></A><BR><BR>And the vision said, "I shall not tell you for certain whether 
<A NAME="635"></A>he is alive or dead, and there is no use in idle conversation."
<A NAME="636"></A><BR><BR>Then it vanished through the thong-hole of the door and was dissipated 
<A NAME="637"></A>into thin air; but Penelope rose from her sleep refreshed and comforted, 
<A NAME="638"></A>so vivid had been her dream.
<A NAME="639"></A><BR><BR>Meantime the suitors went on board and sailed their ways over the 
<A NAME="640"></A>sea, intent on murdering Telemachus. Now there is a rocky islet called 
<A NAME="641"></A>Asteris, of no great size, in mid channel between Ithaca and Samos, and 
<A NAME="642"></A>there is a harbour on either side of it where a ship can lie. Here then 
<A NAME="643"></A>the Achaeans placed themselves in ambush.
