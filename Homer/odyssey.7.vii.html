<A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A>Thus, then, did Ulysses wait and pray; but the girl drove on to the town. 
<A NAME="11"></A>When she reached her father's house she drew up at the gateway, and her 
<A NAME="12"></A>brothers- comely as the gods- gathered round her, took the mules out of 
<A NAME="13"></A>the waggon, and carried the clothes into the house, while she went to her 
<A NAME="14"></A>own room, where an old servant, Eurymedusa of Apeira, lit the fire for 
<A NAME="15"></A>her. This old woman had been brought by sea from Apeira, and had been chosen 
<A NAME="16"></A>as a prize for Alcinous because he was king over the Phaecians, and the 
<A NAME="17"></A>people obeyed him as though he were a god. She had been nurse to Nausicaa, 
<A NAME="18"></A>and had now lit the fire for her, and brought her supper for her into her 
<A NAME="19"></A>own room.
<A NAME="20"></A><BR><BR>Presently Ulysses got up to go towards the town; and Minerva shed 
<A NAME="21"></A>a thick mist all round him to hide him in case any of the proud Phaecians 
<A NAME="22"></A>who met him should be rude to him, or ask him who he was. Then, as he was 
<A NAME="23"></A>just entering the town, she came towards him in the likeness of a little 
<A NAME="24"></A>girl carrying a pitcher. She stood right in front of him, and Ulysses 
<A NAME="25"></A>said:
<A NAME="26"></A><BR><BR>"My dear, will you be so kind as to show me the house of king Alcinous? 
<A NAME="27"></A>I am an unfortunate foreigner in distress, and do not know one in your 
<A NAME="28"></A>town and country."
<A NAME="29"></A><BR><BR>Then Minerva said, "Yes, father stranger, I will show you the house 
<A NAME="30"></A>you want, for Alcinous lives quite close to my own father. I will go before 
<A NAME="31"></A>you and show the way, but say not a word as you go, and do not look at 
<A NAME="32"></A>any man, nor ask him questions; for the people here cannot abide strangers, 
<A NAME="33"></A>and do not like men who come from some other place. They are a sea-faring 
<A NAME="34"></A>folk, and sail the seas by the grace of Neptune in ships that glide along 
<A NAME="35"></A>like thought, or as a bird in the air."
<A NAME="36"></A><BR><BR>On this she led the way, and Ulysses followed in her steps; but 
<A NAME="37"></A>not one of the Phaecians could see him as he passed through the city in 
<A NAME="38"></A>the midst of them; for the great goddess Minerva in her good will towards 
<A NAME="39"></A>him had hidden him in a thick cloud of darkness. He admired their harbours, 
<A NAME="40"></A>ships, places of assembly, and the lofty walls of the city, which, with 
<A NAME="41"></A>the palisade on top of them, were very striking, and when they reached 
<A NAME="42"></A>the king's house Minerva said:
<A NAME="43"></A><BR><BR>"This is the house, father stranger, which you would have me show 
<A NAME="44"></A>you. You will find a number of great people sitting at table, but do not 
<A NAME="45"></A>be afraid; go straight in, for the bolder a man is the more likely he is 
<A NAME="46"></A>to carry his point, even though he is a stranger. First find the queen. 
<A NAME="47"></A>Her name is Arete, and she comes of the same family as her husband Alcinous. 
<A NAME="48"></A>They both descend originally from Neptune, who was father to Nausithous 
<A NAME="49"></A>by Periboea, a woman of great beauty. Periboea was the youngest daughter 
<A NAME="50"></A>of Eurymedon, who at one time reigned over the giants, but he ruined his 
<A NAME="51"></A>ill-fated people and lost his own life to boot.
<A NAME="52"></A><BR><BR>"Neptune, however, lay with his daughter, and she had a son by 
<A NAME="53"></A>him, the great Nausithous, who reigned over the Phaecians. Nausithous had 
<A NAME="54"></A>two sons Rhexenor and Alcinous; Apollo killed the first of them while he 
<A NAME="55"></A>was still a bridegroom and without male issue; but he left a daughter Arete, 
<A NAME="56"></A>whom Alcinous married, and honours as no other woman is honoured of all 
<A NAME="57"></A>those that keep house along with their husbands.
<A NAME="58"></A><BR><BR>"Thus she both was, and still is, respected beyond measure by her 
<A NAME="59"></A>children, by Alcinous himself, and by the whole people, who look upon her 
<A NAME="60"></A>as a goddess, and greet her whenever she goes about the city, for she is 
<A NAME="61"></A>a thoroughly good woman both in head and heart, and when any women are 
<A NAME="62"></A>friends of hers, she will help their husbands also to settle their disputes. 
<A NAME="63"></A>If you can gain her good will, you may have every hope of seeing your friends 
<A NAME="64"></A>again, and getting safely back to your home and country."
<A NAME="65"></A><BR><BR>Then Minerva left Scheria and went away over the sea. She went 
<A NAME="66"></A>to Marathon and to the spacious streets of Athens, where she entered the 
<A NAME="67"></A>abode of Erechtheus; but Ulysses went on to the house of Alcinous, and 
<A NAME="68"></A>he pondered much as he paused a while before reaching the threshold of 
<A NAME="69"></A>bronze, for the splendour of the palace was like that of the sun or moon. 
<A NAME="70"></A>The walls on either side were of bronze from end to end, and the cornice 
<A NAME="71"></A>was of blue enamel. The doors were gold, and hung on pillars of silver 
<A NAME="72"></A>that rose from a floor of bronze, while the lintel was silver and the hook 
<A NAME="73"></A>of the door was of gold.
<A NAME="74"></A><BR><BR>On either side there stood gold and silver mastiffs which Vulcan, 
<A NAME="75"></A>with his consummate skill, had fashioned expressly to keep watch over the 
<A NAME="76"></A>palace of king Alcinous; so they were immortal and could never grow old. 
<A NAME="77"></A>Seats were ranged all along the wall, here and there from one end to the 
<A NAME="78"></A>other, with coverings of fine woven work which the women of the house had 
<A NAME="79"></A>made. Here the chief persons of the Phaecians used to sit and eat and drink, 
<A NAME="80"></A>for there was abundance at all seasons; and there were golden figures of 
<A NAME="81"></A>young men with lighted torches in their hands, raised on pedestals, to 
<A NAME="82"></A>give light by night to those who were at table. There are fifty maid servants 
<A NAME="83"></A>in the house, some of whom are always grinding rich yellow grain at the 
<A NAME="84"></A>mill, while others work at the loom, or sit and spin, and their shuttles 
<A NAME="85"></A>go, backwards and forwards like the fluttering of aspen leaves, while the 
<A NAME="86"></A>linen is so closely woven that it will turn oil. As the Phaecians are the 
<A NAME="87"></A>best sailors in the world, so their women excel all others in weaving, 
<A NAME="88"></A>for Minerva has taught them all manner of useful arts, and they are very 
<A NAME="89"></A>intelligent.
<A NAME="90"></A><BR><BR>Outside the gate of the outer court there is a large garden of 
<A NAME="91"></A>about four acres with a wall all round it. It is full of beautiful trees- 
<A NAME="92"></A>pears, pomegranates, and the most delicious apples. There are luscious 
<A NAME="93"></A>figs also, and olives in full growth. The fruits never rot nor fail all 
<A NAME="94"></A>the year round, neither winter nor summer, for the air is so soft that 
<A NAME="95"></A>a new crop ripens before the old has dropped. Pear grows on pear, apple 
<A NAME="96"></A>on apple, and fig on fig, and so also with the grapes, for there is an 
<A NAME="97"></A>excellent vineyard: on the level ground of a part of this, the grapes are 
<A NAME="98"></A>being made into raisins; in another part they are being gathered; some 
<A NAME="99"></A>are being trodden in the wine tubs, others further on have shed their blossom 
<A NAME="100"></A>and are beginning to show fruit, others again are just changing colour. 
<A NAME="101"></A>In the furthest part of the ground there are beautifully arranged beds 
<A NAME="102"></A>of flowers that are in bloom all the year round. Two streams go through 
<A NAME="103"></A>it, the one turned in ducts throughout the whole garden, while the other 
<A NAME="104"></A>is carried under the ground of the outer court to the house itself, and 
<A NAME="105"></A>the town's people draw water from it. Such, then, were the splendours with 
<A NAME="106"></A>which the gods had endowed the house of king Alcinous.
<A NAME="107"></A><BR><BR>So here Ulysses stood for a while and looked about him, but when 
<A NAME="108"></A>he had looked long enough he crossed the threshold and went within the 
<A NAME="109"></A>precincts of the house. There he found all the chief people among the Phaecians 
<A NAME="110"></A>making their drink-offerings to Mercury, which they always did the last 
<A NAME="111"></A>thing before going away for the night. He went straight through the court, 
<A NAME="112"></A>still hidden by the cloak of darkness in which Minerva had enveloped him, 
<A NAME="113"></A>till he reached Arete and King Alcinous; then he laid his hands upon the 
<A NAME="114"></A>knees of the queen, and at that moment the miraculous darkness fell away 
<A NAME="115"></A>from him and he became visible. Every one was speechless with surprise 
<A NAME="116"></A>at seeing a man there, but Ulysses began at once with his 
<A NAME="117"></A>petition.
<A NAME="118"></A><BR><BR>"Queen Arete," he exclaimed, "daughter of great Rhexenor, in my 
<A NAME="119"></A>distress I humbly pray you, as also your husband and these your guests 
<A NAME="120"></A>(whom may heaven prosper with long life and happiness, and may they leave 
<A NAME="121"></A>their possessions to their children, and all the honours conferred upon 
<A NAME="122"></A>them by the state) to help me home to my own country as soon as possible; 
<A NAME="123"></A>for I have been long in trouble and away from my friends."
<A NAME="124"></A><BR><BR>Then he sat down on the hearth among the ashes and they all held 
<A NAME="125"></A>their peace, till presently the old hero Echeneus, who was an excellent 
<A NAME="126"></A>speaker and an elder among the Phaeacians, plainly and in all honesty addressed 
<A NAME="127"></A>them thus:
<A NAME="128"></A><BR><BR>"Alcinous," said he, "it is not creditable to you that a stranger 
<A NAME="129"></A>should be seen sitting among the ashes of your hearth; every one is waiting 
<A NAME="130"></A>to hear what you are about to say; tell him, then, to rise and take a seat 
<A NAME="131"></A>on a stool inlaid with silver, and bid your servants mix some wine and 
<A NAME="132"></A>water that we may make a drink-offering to Jove the lord of thunder, who 
<A NAME="133"></A>takes all well-disposed suppliants under his protection; and let the housekeeper 
<A NAME="134"></A>give him some supper, of whatever there may be in the 
<A NAME="135"></A>house."
<A NAME="136"></A><BR><BR>When Alcinous heard this he took Ulysses by the hand, raised him 
<A NAME="137"></A>from the hearth, and bade him take the seat of Laodamas, who had been sitting 
<A NAME="138"></A>beside him, and was his favourite son. A maid servant then brought him 
<A NAME="139"></A>water in a beautiful golden ewer and poured it into a silver basin for 
<A NAME="140"></A>him to wash his hands, and she drew a clean table beside him; an upper 
<A NAME="141"></A>servant brought him bread and offered him many good things of what there 
<A NAME="142"></A>was in the house, and Ulysses ate and drank. Then Alcinous said to one 
<A NAME="143"></A>of the servants, "Pontonous, mix a cup of wine and hand it round that we 
<A NAME="144"></A>may make drink-offerings to Jove the lord of thunder, who is the protector 
<A NAME="145"></A>of all well-disposed suppliants."
<A NAME="146"></A><BR><BR>Pontonous then mixed wine and water, and handed it round after 
<A NAME="147"></A>giving every man his drink-offering. When they had made their offerings, 
<A NAME="148"></A>and had drunk each as much as he was minded, Alcinous 
<A NAME="149"></A>said:
<A NAME="150"></A><BR><BR>"Aldermen and town councillors of the Phaeacians, hear my words. 
<A NAME="151"></A>You have had your supper, so now go home to bed. To-morrow morning I shall 
<A NAME="152"></A>invite a still larger number of aldermen, and will give a sacrificial banquet 
<A NAME="153"></A>in honour of our guest; we can then discuss the question of his escort, 
<A NAME="154"></A>and consider how we may at once send him back rejoicing to his own country 
<A NAME="155"></A>without trouble or inconvenience to himself, no matter how distant it may 
<A NAME="156"></A>be. We must see that he comes to no harm while on his homeward journey, 
<A NAME="157"></A>but when he is once at home he will have to take the luck he was born with 
<A NAME="158"></A>for better or worse like other people. It is possible, however, that the 
<A NAME="159"></A>stranger is one of the immortals who has come down from heaven to visit 
<A NAME="160"></A>us; but in this case the gods are departing from their usual practice, 
<A NAME="161"></A>for hitherto they have made themselves perfectly clear to us when we have 
<A NAME="162"></A>been offering them hecatombs. They come and sit at our feasts just like 
<A NAME="163"></A>one of our selves, and if any solitary wayfarer happens to stumble upon 
<A NAME="164"></A>some one or other of them, they affect no concealment, for we are as near 
<A NAME="165"></A>of kin to the gods as the Cyclopes and the savage giants 
<A NAME="166"></A>are."
<A NAME="167"></A><BR><BR>Then Ulysses said: "Pray, Alcinous, do not take any such notion 
<A NAME="168"></A>into your head. I have nothing of the immortal about me, neither in body 
<A NAME="169"></A>nor mind, and most resemble those among you who are the most afflicted. 
<A NAME="170"></A>Indeed, were I to tell you all that heaven has seen fit to lay upon me, 
<A NAME="171"></A>you would say that I was still worse off than they are. Nevertheless, let 
<A NAME="172"></A>me sup in spite of sorrow, for an empty stomach is a very importunate thing, 
<A NAME="173"></A>and thrusts itself on a man's notice no matter how dire is his distress. 
<A NAME="174"></A>I am in great trouble, yet it insists that I shall eat and drink, bids 
<A NAME="175"></A>me lay aside all memory of my sorrows and dwell only on the due replenishing 
<A NAME="176"></A>of itself. As for yourselves, do as you propose, and at break of day set 
<A NAME="177"></A>about helping me to get home. I shall be content to die if I may first 
<A NAME="178"></A>once more behold my property, my bondsmen, and all the greatness of my 
<A NAME="179"></A>house."
<A NAME="180"></A><BR><BR>Thus did he speak. Every one approved his saying, and agreed that 
<A NAME="181"></A>he should have his escort inasmuch as he had spoken reasonably. Then when 
<A NAME="182"></A>they had made their drink-offerings, and had drunk each as much as he was 
<A NAME="183"></A>minded they went home to bed every man in his own abode, leaving Ulysses 
<A NAME="184"></A>in the cloister with Arete and Alcinous while the servants were taking 
<A NAME="185"></A>the things away after supper. Arete was the first to speak, for she recognized 
<A NAME="186"></A>the shirt, cloak, and good clothes that Ulysses was wearing, as the work 
<A NAME="187"></A>of herself and of her maids; so she said, "Stranger, before we go any further, 
<A NAME="188"></A>there is a question I should like to ask you. Who, and whence are you, 
<A NAME="189"></A>and who gave you those clothes? Did you not say you had come here from 
<A NAME="190"></A>beyond the sea?"
<A NAME="191"></A><BR><BR>And Ulysses answered, "It would be a long story Madam, were I to 
<A NAME="192"></A>relate in full the tale of my misfortunes, for the hand of heaven has been 
<A NAME="193"></A>laid heavy upon me; but as regards your question, there is an island far 
<A NAME="194"></A>away in the sea which is called 'the Ogygian.' Here dwells the cunning 
<A NAME="195"></A>and powerful goddess Calypso, daughter of Atlas. She lives by herself far 
<A NAME="196"></A>from all neighbours human or divine. Fortune, however, me to her hearth 
<A NAME="197"></A>all desolate and alone, for Jove struck my ship with his thunderbolts, 
<A NAME="198"></A>and broke it up in mid-ocean. My brave comrades were drowned every man 
<A NAME="199"></A>of them, but I stuck to the keel and was carried hither and thither for 
<A NAME="200"></A>the space of nine days, till at last during the darkness of the tenth night 
<A NAME="201"></A>the gods brought me to the Ogygian island where the great goddess Calypso 
<A NAME="202"></A>lives. She took me in and treated me with the utmost kindness; indeed she 
<A NAME="203"></A>wanted to make me immortal that I might never grow old, but she could not 
<A NAME="204"></A>persuade me to let her do so.
<A NAME="205"></A><BR><BR>"I stayed with Calypso seven years straight on end, and watered 
<A NAME="206"></A>the good clothes she gave me with my tears during the whole time; but at 
<A NAME="207"></A>last when the eighth year came round she bade me depart of her own free 
<A NAME="208"></A>will, either because Jove had told her she must, or because she had changed 
<A NAME="209"></A>her mind. She sent me from her island on a raft, which she provisioned 
<A NAME="210"></A>with abundance of bread and wine. Moreover she gave me good stout clothing, 
<A NAME="211"></A>and sent me a wind that blew both warm and fair. Days seven and ten did 
<A NAME="212"></A>I sail over the sea, and on the eighteenth I caught sight of the first 
<A NAME="213"></A>outlines of the mountains upon your coast- and glad indeed was I to set 
<A NAME="214"></A>eyes upon them. Nevertheless there was still much trouble in store for 
<A NAME="215"></A>me, for at this point Neptune would let me go no further, and raised a 
<A NAME="216"></A>great storm against me; the sea was so terribly high that I could no longer 
<A NAME="217"></A>keep to my raft, which went to pieces under the fury of the gale, and I 
<A NAME="218"></A>had to swim for it, till wind and current brought me to your 
<A NAME="219"></A>shores.
<A NAME="220"></A><BR><BR>"There I tried to land, but could not, for it was a bad place and 
<A NAME="221"></A>the waves dashed me against the rocks, so I again took to the sea and swam 
<A NAME="222"></A>on till I came to a river that seemed the most likely landing place, for 
<A NAME="223"></A>there were no rocks and it was sheltered from the wind. Here, then, I got 
<A NAME="224"></A>out of the water and gathered my senses together again. Night was coming 
<A NAME="225"></A>on, so I left the river, and went into a thicket, where I covered myself 
<A NAME="226"></A>all over with leaves, and presently heaven sent me off into a very deep 
<A NAME="227"></A>sleep. Sick and sorry as I was I slept among the leaves all night, and 
<A NAME="228"></A>through the next day till afternoon, when I woke as the sun was westering, 
<A NAME="229"></A>and saw your daughter's maid servants playing upon the beach, and your 
<A NAME="230"></A>daughter among them looking like a goddess. I besought her aid, and she 
<A NAME="231"></A>proved to be of an excellent disposition, much more so than could be expected 
<A NAME="232"></A>from so young a person- for young people are apt to be thoughtless. She 
<A NAME="233"></A>gave me plenty of bread and wine, and when she had had me washed in the 
<A NAME="234"></A>river she also gave me the clothes in which you see me. Now, therefore, 
<A NAME="235"></A>though it has pained me to do so, I have told you the whole 
<A NAME="236"></A>truth."
<A NAME="237"></A><BR><BR>Then Alcinous said, "Stranger, it was very wrong of my daughter 
<A NAME="238"></A>not to bring you on at once to my house along with the maids, seeing that 
<A NAME="239"></A>she was the first person whose aid you asked."
<A NAME="240"></A><BR><BR>"Pray do not scold her," replied Ulysses; "she is not to blame. 
<A NAME="241"></A>She did tell me to follow along with the maids, but I was ashamed and afraid, 
<A NAME="242"></A>for I thought you might perhaps be displeased if you saw me. Every human 
<A NAME="243"></A>being is sometimes a little suspicious and irritable."
<A NAME="244"></A><BR><BR>"Stranger," replied Alcinous, "I am not the kind of man to get 
<A NAME="245"></A>angry about nothing; it is always better to be reasonable; but by Father 
<A NAME="246"></A>Jove, Minerva, and Apollo, now that I see what kind of person you are, 
<A NAME="247"></A>and how much you think as I do, I wish you would stay here, marry my daughter, 
<A NAME="248"></A>and become my son-in-law. If you will stay I will give you a house and 
<A NAME="249"></A>an estate, but no one (heaven forbid) shall keep you here against your 
<A NAME="250"></A>own wish, and that you may be sure of this I will attend to-morrow to the 
<A NAME="251"></A>matter of your escort. You can sleep during the whole voyage if you like, 
<A NAME="252"></A>and the men shall sail you over smooth waters either to your own home, 
<A NAME="253"></A>or wherever you please, even though it be a long way further off than Euboea, 
<A NAME="254"></A>which those of my people who saw it when they took yellow-haired Rhadamanthus 
<A NAME="255"></A>to see Tityus the son of Gaia, tell me is the furthest of any place- and 
<A NAME="256"></A>yet they did the whole voyage in a single day without distressing themselves, 
<A NAME="257"></A>and came back again afterwards. You will thus see how much my ships excel 
<A NAME="258"></A>all others, and what magnificent oarsmen my sailors 
<A NAME="259"></A>are."
<A NAME="260"></A><BR><BR>Then was Ulysses glad and prayed aloud saying, "Father Jove, grant 
<A NAME="261"></A>that Alcinous may do all as he has said, for so he will win an imperishable 
<A NAME="262"></A>name among mankind, and at the same time I shall return to my 
<A NAME="263"></A>country."
<A NAME="264"></A><BR><BR>Thus did they converse. Then Arete told her maids to set a bed 
<A NAME="265"></A>in the room that was in the gatehouse, and make it with good red rugs, 
<A NAME="266"></A>and to spread coverlets on the top of them with woollen cloaks for Ulysses 
<A NAME="267"></A>to wear. The maids thereon went out with torches in their hands, and when 
<A NAME="268"></A>they had made the bed they came up to Ulysses and said, "Rise, sir stranger, 
<A NAME="269"></A>and come with us for your bed is ready," and glad indeed was he to go to 
<A NAME="270"></A>his rest.
<A NAME="271"></A><BR><BR>So Ulysses slept in a bed placed in a room over the echoing gateway; 
<A NAME="272"></A>but Alcinous lay in the inner part of the house, with the queen his wife 
<A NAME="273"></A>by his side.
