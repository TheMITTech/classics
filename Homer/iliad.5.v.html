<A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A>Then Pallas Minerva put valour into the heart of Diomed, son of Tydeus, 
<A NAME="11"></A>that he might excel all the other Argives, and cover himself with glory. 
<A NAME="12"></A>She made a stream of fire flare from his shield and helmet like the star 
<A NAME="13"></A>that shines most brilliantly in summer after its bath in the waters of 
<A NAME="14"></A>Oceanus- even such a fire did she kindle upon his head and shoulders as 
<A NAME="15"></A>she bade him speed into the thickest hurly-burly of the 
<A NAME="16"></A>fight.
<A NAME="17"></A><BR><BR>Now there was a certain rich and honourable man among the Trojans, 
<A NAME="18"></A>priest of Vulcan, and his name was Dares. He had two sons, Phegeus and 
<A NAME="19"></A>Idaeus, both of them skilled in all the arts of war. These two came forward 
<A NAME="20"></A>from the main body of Trojans, and set upon Diomed, he being on foot, while 
<A NAME="21"></A>they fought from their chariot. When they were close up to one another, 
<A NAME="22"></A>Phegeus took aim first, but his spear went over Diomed's left shoulder 
<A NAME="23"></A>without hitting him. Diomed then threw, and his spear sped not in vain, 
<A NAME="24"></A>for it hit Phegeus on the breast near the nipple, and he fell from his 
<A NAME="25"></A>chariot. Idaeus did not dare to bestride his brother's body, but sprang 
<A NAME="26"></A>from the chariot and took to flight, or he would have shared his brother's 
<A NAME="27"></A>fate; whereon Vulcan saved him by wrapping him in a cloud of darkness, 
<A NAME="28"></A>that his old father might not be utterly overwhelmed with grief; but the 
<A NAME="29"></A>son of Tydeus drove off with the horses, and bade his followers take them 
<A NAME="30"></A>to the ships. The Trojans were scared when they saw the two sons of Dares, 
<A NAME="31"></A>one of them in fright and the other lying dead by his chariot. Minerva, 
<A NAME="32"></A>therefore, took Mars by the hand and said, "Mars, Mars, bane of men, bloodstained 
<A NAME="33"></A>stormer of cities, may we not now leave the Trojans and Achaeans to fight 
<A NAME="34"></A>it out, and see to which of the two Jove will vouchsafe the victory? Let 
<A NAME="35"></A>us go away, and thus avoid his anger."
<A NAME="36"></A><BR><BR>So saying, she drew Mars out of the battle, and set him down upon 
<A NAME="37"></A>the steep banks of the Scamander. Upon this the Danaans drove the Trojans 
<A NAME="38"></A>back, and each one of their chieftains killed his man. First King Agamemnon 
<A NAME="39"></A>flung mighty Odius, captain of the Halizoni, from his chariot. The spear 
<A NAME="40"></A>of Agamemnon caught him on the broad of his back, just as he was turning 
<A NAME="41"></A>in flight; it struck him between the shoulders and went right through his 
<A NAME="42"></A>chest, and his armour rang rattling round him as he fell heavily to the 
<A NAME="43"></A>ground.
<A NAME="44"></A><BR><BR>Then Idomeneus killed Phaesus, son of Borus the Meonian, who had 
<A NAME="45"></A>come from Varne. Mighty Idomeneus speared him on the right shoulder as 
<A NAME="46"></A>he was mounting his chariot, and the darkness of death enshrouded him as 
<A NAME="47"></A>he fell heavily from the car.
<A NAME="48"></A><BR><BR>The squires of Idomeneus spoiled him of his armour, while Menelaus, 
<A NAME="49"></A>son of Atreus, killed Scamandrius the son of Strophius, a mighty huntsman 
<A NAME="50"></A>and keen lover of the chase. Diana herself had taught him how to kill every 
<A NAME="51"></A>kind of wild creature that is bred in mountain forests, but neither she 
<A NAME="52"></A>nor his famed skill in archery could now save him, for the spear of Menelaus 
<A NAME="53"></A>struck him in the back as he was flying; it struck him between the shoulders 
<A NAME="54"></A>and went right through his chest, so that he fell headlong and his armour 
<A NAME="55"></A>rang rattling round him.
<A NAME="56"></A><BR><BR>Meriones then killed Phereclus the son of Tecton, who was the son 
<A NAME="57"></A>of Hermon, a man whose hand was skilled in all manner of cunning workmanship, 
<A NAME="58"></A>for Pallas Minerva had dearly loved him. He it was that made the ships 
<A NAME="59"></A>for Alexandrus, which were the beginning of all mischief, and brought evil 
<A NAME="60"></A>alike both on the Trojans and on Alexandrus himself; for he heeded not 
<A NAME="61"></A>the decrees of heaven. Meriones overtook him as he was flying, and struck 
<A NAME="62"></A>him on the right buttock. The point of the spear went through the bone 
<A NAME="63"></A>into the bladder, and death came upon him as he cried aloud and fell forward 
<A NAME="64"></A>on his knees.
<A NAME="65"></A><BR><BR>Meges, moreover, slew Pedaeus, son of Antenor, who, though he was 
<A NAME="66"></A>a bastard, had been brought up by Theano as one of her own children, for 
<A NAME="67"></A>the love she bore her husband. The son of Phyleus got close up to him and 
<A NAME="68"></A>drove a spear into the nape of his neck: it went under his tongue all among 
<A NAME="69"></A>his teeth, so he bit the cold bronze, and fell dead in the 
<A NAME="70"></A>dust.
<A NAME="71"></A><BR><BR>And Eurypylus, son of Euaemon, killed Hypsenor, the son of noble 
<A NAME="72"></A>Dolopion, who had been made priest of the river Scamander, and was honoured 
<A NAME="73"></A>among the people as though he were a god. Eurypylus gave him chase as he 
<A NAME="74"></A>was flying before him, smote him with his sword upon the arm, and lopped 
<A NAME="75"></A>his strong hand from off it. The bloody hand fell to the ground, and the 
<A NAME="76"></A>shades of death, with fate that no man can withstand, came over his 
<A NAME="77"></A>eyes.
<A NAME="78"></A><BR><BR>Thus furiously did the battle rage between them. As for the son 
<A NAME="79"></A>of Tydeus, you could not say whether he was more among the Achaeans or 
<A NAME="80"></A>the Trojans. He rushed across the plain like a winter torrent that has 
<A NAME="81"></A>burst its barrier in full flood; no dykes, no walls of fruitful vineyards 
<A NAME="82"></A>can embank it when it is swollen with rain from heaven, but in a moment 
<A NAME="83"></A>it comes tearing onward, and lays many a field waste that many a strong 
<A NAME="84"></A>man hand has reclaimed- even so were the dense phalanxes of the Trojans 
<A NAME="85"></A>driven in rout by the son of Tydeus, and many though they were, they dared 
<A NAME="86"></A>not abide his onslaught.
<A NAME="87"></A><BR><BR>Now when the son of Lycaon saw him scouring the plain and driving 
<A NAME="88"></A>the Trojans pell-mell before him, he aimed an arrow and hit the front part 
<A NAME="89"></A>of his cuirass near the shoulder: the arrow went right through the metal 
<A NAME="90"></A>and pierced the flesh, so that the cuirass was covered with blood. On this 
<A NAME="91"></A>the son of Lycaon shouted in triumph, "Knights Trojans, come on; the bravest 
<A NAME="92"></A>of the Achaeans is wounded, and he will not hold out much longer if King 
<A NAME="93"></A>Apollo was indeed with me when I sped from Lycia hither."
<A NAME="94"></A><BR><BR>Thus did he vaunt; but his arrow had not killed Diomed, who withdrew 
<A NAME="95"></A>and made for the chariot and horses of Sthenelus, the son of Capaneus. 
<A NAME="96"></A>"Dear son of Capaneus," said he, "come down from your chariot, and draw 
<A NAME="97"></A>the arrow out of my shoulder."
<A NAME="98"></A><BR><BR>Sthenelus sprang from his chariot, and drew the arrow from the 
<A NAME="99"></A>wound, whereon the blood came spouting out through the hole that had been 
<A NAME="100"></A>made in his shirt. Then Diomed prayed, saying, "Hear me, daughter of aegis-bearing 
<A NAME="101"></A>Jove, unweariable, if ever you loved my father well and stood by him in 
<A NAME="102"></A>the thick of a fight, do the like now by me; grant me to come within a 
<A NAME="103"></A>spear's throw of that man and kill him. He has been too quick for me and 
<A NAME="104"></A>has wounded me; and now he is boasting that I shall not see the light of 
<A NAME="105"></A>the sun much longer."
<A NAME="106"></A><BR><BR>Thus he prayed, and Pallas Minerva heard him; she made his limbs 
<A NAME="107"></A>supple and quickened his hands and his feet. Then she went up close to 
<A NAME="108"></A>him and said, "Fear not, Diomed, to do battle with the Trojans, for I have 
<A NAME="109"></A>set in your heart the spirit of your knightly father Tydeus. Moreover, 
<A NAME="110"></A>I have withdrawn the veil from your eyes, that you know gods and men apart. 
<A NAME="111"></A>If, then, any other god comes here and offers you battle, do not fight 
<A NAME="112"></A>him; but should Jove's daughter Venus come, strike her with your spear 
<A NAME="113"></A>and wound her."
<A NAME="114"></A><BR><BR>When she had said this Minerva went away, and the son of Tydeus 
<A NAME="115"></A>again took his place among the foremost fighters, three times more fierce 
<A NAME="116"></A>even than he had been before. He was like a lion that some mountain shepherd 
<A NAME="117"></A>has wounded, but not killed, as he is springing over the wall of a sheep-yard 
<A NAME="118"></A>to attack the sheep. The shepherd has roused the brute to fury but cannot 
<A NAME="119"></A>defend his flock, so he takes shelter under cover of the buildings, while 
<A NAME="120"></A>the sheep, panic-stricken on being deserted, are smothered in heaps one 
<A NAME="121"></A>on top of the other, and the angry lion leaps out over the sheep-yard wall. 
<A NAME="122"></A>Even thus did Diomed go furiously about among the Trojans.
<A NAME="123"></A><BR><BR>He killed Astynous, and shepherd of his people, the one with a 
<A NAME="124"></A>thrust of his spear, which struck him above the nipple, the other with 
<A NAME="125"></A>a sword- cut on the collar-bone, that severed his shoulder from his neck 
<A NAME="126"></A>and back. He let both of them lie, and went in pursuit of Abas and Polyidus, 
<A NAME="127"></A>sons of the old reader of dreams Eurydamas: they never came back for him 
<A NAME="128"></A>to read them any more dreams, for mighty Diomed made an end of them. He 
<A NAME="129"></A>then gave chase to Xanthus and Thoon, the two sons of Phaenops, both of 
<A NAME="130"></A>them very dear to him, for he was now worn out with age, and begat no more 
<A NAME="131"></A>sons to inherit his possessions. But Diomed took both their lives and left 
<A NAME="132"></A>their father sorrowing bitterly, for he nevermore saw them come home from 
<A NAME="133"></A>battle alive, and his kinsmen divided his wealth among 
<A NAME="134"></A>themselves.
<A NAME="135"></A><BR><BR>Then he came upon two sons of Priam, Echemmon and Chromius, as 
<A NAME="136"></A>they were both in one chariot. He sprang upon them as a lion fastens on 
<A NAME="137"></A>the neck of some cow or heifer when the herd is feeding in a coppice. For 
<A NAME="138"></A>all their vain struggles he flung them both from their chariot and stripped 
<A NAME="139"></A>the armour from their bodies. Then he gave their horses to his comrades 
<A NAME="140"></A>to take them back to the ships.
<A NAME="141"></A><BR><BR>When Aeneas saw him thus making havoc among the ranks, he went 
<A NAME="142"></A>through the fight amid the rain of spears to see if he could find Pandarus. 
<A NAME="143"></A>When he had found the brave son of Lycaon he said, "Pandarus, where is 
<A NAME="144"></A>now your bow, your winged arrows, and your renown as an archer, in respect 
<A NAME="145"></A>of which no man here can rival you nor is there any in Lycia that can beat 
<A NAME="146"></A>you? Lift then your hands to Jove and send an arrow at this fellow who 
<A NAME="147"></A>is going so masterfully about, and has done such deadly work among the 
<A NAME="148"></A>Trojans. He has killed many a brave man- unless indeed he is some god who 
<A NAME="149"></A>is angry with the Trojans about their sacrifices, and and has set his hand 
<A NAME="150"></A>against them in his displeasure."
<A NAME="151"></A><BR><BR>And the son of Lycaon answered, "Aeneas, I take him for none other 
<A NAME="152"></A>than the son of Tydeus. I know him by his shield, the visor of his helmet, 
<A NAME="153"></A>and by his horses. It is possible that he may be a god, but if he is the 
<A NAME="154"></A>man I say he is, he is not making all this havoc without heaven's help, 
<A NAME="155"></A>but has some god by his side who is shrouded in a cloud of darkness, and 
<A NAME="156"></A>who turned my arrow aside when it had hit him. I have taken aim at him 
<A NAME="157"></A>already and hit him on the right shoulder; my arrow went through the breastpiece 
<A NAME="158"></A>of his cuirass; and I made sure I should send him hurrying to the world 
<A NAME="159"></A>below, but it seems that I have not killed him. There must be a god who 
<A NAME="160"></A>is angry with me. Moreover I have neither horse nor chariot. In my father's 
<A NAME="161"></A>stables there are eleven excellent chariots, fresh from the builder, quite 
<A NAME="162"></A>new, with cloths spread over them; and by each of them there stand a pair 
<A NAME="163"></A>of horses, champing barley and rye; my old father Lycaon urged me again 
<A NAME="164"></A>and again when I was at home and on the point of starting, to take chariots 
<A NAME="165"></A>and horses with me that I might lead the Trojans in battle, but I would 
<A NAME="166"></A>not listen to him; it would have been much better if I had done so, but 
<A NAME="167"></A>I was thinking about the horses, which had been used to eat their fill, 
<A NAME="168"></A>and I was afraid that in such a great gathering of men they might be ill-fed, 
<A NAME="169"></A>so I left them at home and came on foot to Ilius armed only with my bow 
<A NAME="170"></A>and arrows. These it seems, are of no use, for I have already hit two chieftains, 
<A NAME="171"></A>the sons of Atreus and of Tydeus, and though I drew blood surely enough, 
<A NAME="172"></A>I have only made them still more furious. I did ill to take my bow down 
<A NAME="173"></A>from its peg on the day I led my band of Trojans to Ilius in Hector's service, 
<A NAME="174"></A>and if ever I get home again to set eyes on my native place, my wife, and 
<A NAME="175"></A>the greatness of my house, may some one cut my head off then and there 
<A NAME="176"></A>if I do not break the bow and set it on a hot fire- such pranks as it plays 
<A NAME="177"></A>me."
<A NAME="178"></A><BR><BR>Aeneas answered, "Say no more. Things will not mend till we two 
<A NAME="179"></A>go against this man with chariot and horses and bring him to a trial of 
<A NAME="180"></A>arms. Mount my chariot, and note how cleverly the horses of Tros can speed 
<A NAME="181"></A>hither and thither over the plain in pursuit or flight. If Jove again vouchsafes 
<A NAME="182"></A>glory to the son of Tydeus they will carry us safely back to the city. 
<A NAME="183"></A>Take hold, then, of the whip and reins while I stand upon the car to fight, 
<A NAME="184"></A>or else do you wait this man's onset while I look after the 
<A NAME="185"></A>horses."
<A NAME="186"></A><BR><BR>"Aeneas." replied the son of Lycaon, "take the reins and drive; 
<A NAME="187"></A>if we have to fly before the son of Tydeus the horses will go better for 
<A NAME="188"></A>their own driver. If they miss the sound of your voice when they expect 
<A NAME="189"></A>it they may be frightened, and refuse to take us out of the fight. The 
<A NAME="190"></A>son of Tydeus will then kill both of us and take the horses. Therefore 
<A NAME="191"></A>drive them yourself and I will be ready for him with my 
<A NAME="192"></A>spear."
<A NAME="193"></A><BR><BR>They then mounted the chariot and drove full-speed towards the 
<A NAME="194"></A>son of Tydeus. Sthenelus, son of Capaneus, saw them coming and said to 
<A NAME="195"></A>Diomed, "Diomed, son of Tydeus, man after my own heart, I see two heroes 
<A NAME="196"></A>speeding towards you, both of them men of might the one a skilful archer, 
<A NAME="197"></A>Pandarus son of Lycaon, the other, Aeneas, whose sire is Anchises, while 
<A NAME="198"></A>his mother is Venus. Mount the chariot and let us retreat. Do not, I pray 
<A NAME="199"></A>you, press so furiously forward, or you may get killed."
<A NAME="200"></A><BR><BR>Diomed looked angrily at him and answered: "Talk not of flight, 
<A NAME="201"></A>for I shall not listen to you: I am of a race that knows neither flight 
<A NAME="202"></A>nor fear, and my limbs are as yet unwearied. I am in no mind to mount, 
<A NAME="203"></A>but will go against them even as I am; Pallas Minerva bids me be afraid 
<A NAME="204"></A>of no man, and even though one of them escape, their steeds shall not take 
<A NAME="205"></A>both back again. I say further, and lay my saying to your heart- if Minerva 
<A NAME="206"></A>sees fit to vouchsafe me the glory of killing both, stay your horses here 
<A NAME="207"></A>and make the reins fast to the rim of the chariot; then be sure you spring 
<A NAME="208"></A>Aeneas' horses and drive them from the Trojan to the Achaean ranks. They 
<A NAME="209"></A>are of the stock that great Jove gave to Tros in payment for his son Ganymede, 
<A NAME="210"></A>and are the finest that live and move under the sun. King Anchises stole 
<A NAME="211"></A>the blood by putting his mares to them without Laomedon's knowledge, and 
<A NAME="212"></A>they bore him six foals. Four are still in his stables, but he gave the 
<A NAME="213"></A>other two to Aeneas. We shall win great glory if we can take 
<A NAME="214"></A>them."
<A NAME="215"></A><BR><BR>Thus did they converse, but the other two had now driven close 
<A NAME="216"></A>up to them, and the son of Lycaon spoke first. "Great and mighty son," 
<A NAME="217"></A>said he, "of noble Tydeus, my arrow failed to lay you low, so I will now 
<A NAME="218"></A>try with my spear."
<A NAME="219"></A><BR><BR>He poised his spear as he spoke and hurled it from him. It struck 
<A NAME="220"></A>the shield of the son of Tydeus; the bronze point pierced it and passed 
<A NAME="221"></A>on till it reached the breastplate. Thereon the son of Lycaon shouted out 
<A NAME="222"></A>and said, "You are hit clean through the belly; you will not stand out 
<A NAME="223"></A>for long, and the glory of the fight is mine."
<A NAME="224"></A><BR><BR>But Diomed all undismayed made answer, "You have missed, not hit, 
<A NAME="225"></A>and before you two see the end of this matter one or other of you shall 
<A NAME="226"></A>glut tough-shielded Mars with his blood."
<A NAME="227"></A><BR><BR>With this he hurled his spear, and Minerva guided it on to Pandarus's 
<A NAME="228"></A>nose near the eye. It went crashing in among his white teeth; the bronze 
<A NAME="229"></A>point cut through the root of his to tongue, coming out under his chin, 
<A NAME="230"></A>and his glistening armour rang rattling round him as he fell heavily to 
<A NAME="231"></A>the ground. The horses started aside for fear, and he was reft of life 
<A NAME="232"></A>and strength.
<A NAME="233"></A><BR><BR>Aeneas sprang from his chariot armed with shield and spear, fearing 
<A NAME="234"></A>lest the Achaeans should carry off the body. He bestrode it as a lion in 
<A NAME="235"></A>the pride of strength, with shield and on spear before him and a cry of 
<A NAME="236"></A>battle on his lips resolute to kill the first that should dare face him. 
<A NAME="237"></A>But the son of Tydeus caught up a mighty stone, so huge and great that 
<A NAME="238"></A>as men now are it would take two to lift it; nevertheless he bore it aloft 
<A NAME="239"></A>with ease unaided, and with this he struck Aeneas on the groin where the 
<A NAME="240"></A>hip turns in the joint that is called the "cup-bone." The stone crushed 
<A NAME="241"></A>this joint, and broke both the sinews, while its jagged edges tore away 
<A NAME="242"></A>all the flesh. The hero fell on his knees, and propped himself with his 
<A NAME="243"></A>hand resting on the ground till the darkness of night fell upon his eyes. 
<A NAME="244"></A>And now Aeneas, king of men, would have perished then and there, had not 
<A NAME="245"></A>his mother, Jove's daughter Venus, who had conceived him by Anchises when 
<A NAME="246"></A>he was herding cattle, been quick to mark, and thrown her two white arms 
<A NAME="247"></A>about the body of her dear son. She protected him by covering him with 
<A NAME="248"></A>a fold of her own fair garment, lest some Danaan should drive a spear into 
<A NAME="249"></A>his breast and kill him.
<A NAME="250"></A><BR><BR>Thus, then, did she bear her dear son out of the fight. But the 
<A NAME="251"></A>son of Capaneus was not unmindful of the orders that Diomed had given him. 
<A NAME="252"></A>He made his own horses fast, away from the hurly-burly, by binding the 
<A NAME="253"></A>reins to the rim of the chariot. Then he sprang upon Aeneas's horses and 
<A NAME="254"></A>drove them from the Trojan to the Achaean ranks. When he had so done he 
<A NAME="255"></A>gave them over to his chosen comrade Deipylus, whom he valued above all 
<A NAME="256"></A>others as the one who was most like-minded with himself, to take them on 
<A NAME="257"></A>to the ships. He then remounted his own chariot, seized the reins, and 
<A NAME="258"></A>drove with all speed in search of the son of Tydeus.
<A NAME="259"></A><BR><BR>Now the son of Tydeus was in pursuit of the Cyprian goddess, spear 
<A NAME="260"></A>in hand, for he knew her to be feeble and not one of those goddesses that 
<A NAME="261"></A>can lord it among men in battle like Minerva or Enyo the waster of cities, 
<A NAME="262"></A>and when at last after a long chase he caught her up, he flew at her and 
<A NAME="263"></A>thrust his spear into the flesh of her delicate hand. The point tore through 
<A NAME="264"></A>the ambrosial robe which the Graces had woven for her, and pierced the 
<A NAME="265"></A>skin between her wrist and the palm of her hand, so that the immortal blood, 
<A NAME="266"></A>or ichor, that flows in the veins of the blessed gods, came pouring from 
<A NAME="267"></A>the wound; for the gods do not eat bread nor drink wine, hence they have 
<A NAME="268"></A>no blood such as ours, and are immortal. Venus screamed aloud, and let 
<A NAME="269"></A>her son fall, but Phoebus Apollo caught him in his arms, and hid him in 
<A NAME="270"></A>a cloud of darkness, lest some Danaan should drive a spear into his breast 
<A NAME="271"></A>and kill him; and Diomed shouted out as he left her, "Daughter of Jove, 
<A NAME="272"></A>leave war and battle alone, can you not be contented with beguiling silly 
<A NAME="273"></A>women? If you meddle with fighting you will get what will make you shudder 
<A NAME="274"></A>at the very name of war."
<A NAME="275"></A><BR><BR>The goddess went dazed and discomfited away, and Iris, fleet as 
<A NAME="276"></A>the wind, drew her from the throng, in pain and with her fair skin all 
<A NAME="277"></A>besmirched. She found fierce Mars waiting on the left of the battle, with 
<A NAME="278"></A>his spear and his two fleet steeds resting on a cloud; whereon she fell 
<A NAME="279"></A>on her knees before her brother and implored him to let her have his horses. 
<A NAME="280"></A>"Dear brother," she cried, "save me, and give me your horses to take me 
<A NAME="281"></A>to Olympus where the gods dwell. I am badly wounded by a mortal, the son 
<A NAME="282"></A>of Tydeus, who would now fight even with father Jove."
<A NAME="283"></A><BR><BR>Thus she spoke, and Mars gave her his gold-bedizened steeds. She 
<A NAME="284"></A>mounted the chariot sick and sorry at heart, while Iris sat beside her 
<A NAME="285"></A>and took the reins in her hand. She lashed her horses on and they flew 
<A NAME="286"></A>forward nothing loth, till in a trice they were at high Olympus, where 
<A NAME="287"></A>the gods have their dwelling. There she stayed them, unloosed them from 
<A NAME="288"></A>the chariot, and gave them their ambrosial forage; but Venus flung herself 
<A NAME="289"></A>on to the lap of her mother Dione, who threw her arms about her and caressed 
<A NAME="290"></A>her, saying, "Which of the heavenly beings has been treating you in this 
<A NAME="291"></A>way, as though you had been doing something wrong in the face of 
<A NAME="292"></A>day?"
<A NAME="293"></A><BR><BR>And laughter-loving Venus answered, "Proud Diomed, the son of Tydeus, 
<A NAME="294"></A>wounded me because I was bearing my dear son Aeneas, whom I love best of 
<A NAME="295"></A>all mankind, out of the fight. The war is no longer one between Trojans 
<A NAME="296"></A>and Achaeans, for the Danaans have now taken to fighting with the 
<A NAME="297"></A>immortals."
<A NAME="298"></A><BR><BR>"Bear it, my child," replied Dione, "and make the best of it. We 
<A NAME="299"></A>dwellers in Olympus have to put up with much at the hands of men, and we 
<A NAME="300"></A>lay much suffering on one another. Mars had to suffer when Otus and Ephialtes, 
<A NAME="301"></A>children of Aloeus, bound him in cruel bonds, so that he lay thirteen months 
<A NAME="302"></A>imprisoned in a vessel of bronze. Mars would have then perished had not 
<A NAME="303"></A>fair Eeriboea, stepmother to the sons of Aloeus, told Mercury, who stole 
<A NAME="304"></A>him away when he was already well-nigh worn out by the severity of his 
<A NAME="305"></A>bondage. Juno, again, suffered when the mighty son of Amphitryon wounded 
<A NAME="306"></A>her on the right breast with a three-barbed arrow, and nothing could assuage 
<A NAME="307"></A>her pain. So, also, did huge Hades, when this same man, the son of aegis-bearing 
<A NAME="308"></A>Jove, hit him with an arrow even at the gates of hell, and hurt him badly. 
<A NAME="309"></A>Thereon Hades went to the house of Jove on great Olympus, angry and full 
<A NAME="310"></A>of pain; and the arrow in his brawny shoulder caused him great anguish 
<A NAME="311"></A>till Paeeon healed him by spreading soothing herbs on the wound, for Hades 
<A NAME="312"></A>was not of mortal mould. Daring, head-strong, evildoer who recked not of 
<A NAME="313"></A>his sin in shooting the gods that dwell in Olympus. And now Minerva has 
<A NAME="314"></A>egged this son of Tydeus on against yourself, fool that he is for not reflecting 
<A NAME="315"></A>that no man who fights with gods will live long or hear his children prattling 
<A NAME="316"></A>about his knees when he returns from battle. Let, then, the son of Tydeus 
<A NAME="317"></A>see that he does not have to fight with one who is stronger than you are. 
<A NAME="318"></A>Then shall his brave wife Aegialeia, daughter of Adrestus, rouse her whole 
<A NAME="319"></A>house from sleep, wailing for the loss of her wedded lord, Diomed the bravest 
<A NAME="320"></A>of the Achaeans."
<A NAME="321"></A><BR><BR>So saying, she wiped the ichor from the wrist of her daughter with 
<A NAME="322"></A>both hands, whereon the pain left her, and her hand was healed. But Minerva 
<A NAME="323"></A>and Juno, who were looking on, began to taunt Jove with their mocking talk, 
<A NAME="324"></A>and Minerva was first to speak. "Father Jove," said she, "do not be angry 
<A NAME="325"></A>with me, but I think the Cyprian must have been persuading some one of 
<A NAME="326"></A>the Achaean women to go with the Trojans of whom she is so very fond, and 
<A NAME="327"></A>while caressing one or other of them she must have torn her delicate hand 
<A NAME="328"></A>with the gold pin of the woman's brooch."
<A NAME="329"></A><BR><BR>The sire of gods and men smiled, and called golden Venus to his 
<A NAME="330"></A>side. "My child," said he, "it has not been given you to be a warrior. 
<A NAME="331"></A>Attend, henceforth, to your own delightful matrimonial duties, and leave 
<A NAME="332"></A>all this fighting to Mars and to Minerva."
<A NAME="333"></A><BR><BR>Thus did they converse. But Diomed sprang upon Aeneas, though he 
<A NAME="334"></A>knew him to be in the very arms of Apollo. Not one whit did he fear the 
<A NAME="335"></A>mighty god, so set was he on killing Aeneas and stripping him of his armour. 
<A NAME="336"></A>Thrice did he spring forward with might and main to slay him, and thrice 
<A NAME="337"></A>did Apollo beat back his gleaming shield. When he was coming on for the 
<A NAME="338"></A>fourth time, as though he were a god, Apollo shouted to him with an awful 
<A NAME="339"></A>voice and said, "Take heed, son of Tydeus, and draw off; think not to match 
<A NAME="340"></A>yourself against gods, for men that walk the earth cannot hold their own 
<A NAME="341"></A>with the immortals."
<A NAME="342"></A><BR><BR>The son of Tydeus then gave way for a little space, to avoid the 
<A NAME="343"></A>anger of the god, while Apollo took Aeneas out of the crowd and set him 
<A NAME="344"></A>in sacred Pergamus, where his temple stood. There, within the mighty sanctuary, 
<A NAME="345"></A>Latona and Diana healed him and made him glorious to behold, while Apollo 
<A NAME="346"></A>of the silver bow fashioned a wraith in the likeness of Aeneas, and armed 
<A NAME="347"></A>as he was. Round this the Trojans and Achaeans hacked at the bucklers about 
<A NAME="348"></A>one another's breasts, hewing each other's round shields and light hide-covered 
<A NAME="349"></A>targets. Then Phoebus Apollo said to Mars, "Mars, Mars, bane of men, blood-stained 
<A NAME="350"></A>stormer of cities, can you not go to this man, the son of Tydeus, who would 
<A NAME="351"></A>now fight even with father Jove, and draw him out of the battle? He first 
<A NAME="352"></A>went up to the Cyprian and wounded her in the hand near her wrist, and 
<A NAME="353"></A>afterwards sprang upon me too, as though he were a god."
<A NAME="354"></A><BR><BR>He then took his seat on the top of Pergamus, while murderous Mars 
<A NAME="355"></A>went about among the ranks of the Trojans, cheering them on, in the likeness 
<A NAME="356"></A>of fleet Acamas chief of the Thracians. "Sons of Priam," said he, "how 
<A NAME="357"></A>long will you let your people be thus slaughtered by the Achaeans? Would 
<A NAME="358"></A>you wait till they are at the walls of Troy? Aeneas the son of Anchises 
<A NAME="359"></A>has fallen, he whom we held in as high honour as Hector himself. Help me, 
<A NAME="360"></A>then, to rescue our brave comrade from the stress of the 
<A NAME="361"></A>fight."
<A NAME="362"></A><BR><BR>With these words he put heart and soul into them all. Then Sarpedon 
<A NAME="363"></A>rebuked Hector very sternly. "Hector," said he, "where is your prowess 
<A NAME="364"></A>now? You used to say that though you had neither people nor allies you 
<A NAME="365"></A>could hold the town alone with your brothers and brothers-in-law. I see 
<A NAME="366"></A>not one of them here; they cower as hounds before a lion; it is we, your 
<A NAME="367"></A>allies, who bear the brunt of the battle. I have come from afar, even from 
<A NAME="368"></A>Lycia and the banks of the river Xanthus, where I have left my wife, my 
<A NAME="369"></A>infant son, and much wealth to tempt whoever is needy; nevertheless, I 
<A NAME="370"></A>head my Lycian soldiers and stand my ground against any who would fight 
<A NAME="371"></A>me though I have nothing here for the Achaeans to plunder, while you look 
<A NAME="372"></A>on, without even bidding your men stand firm in defence of their wives. 
<A NAME="373"></A>See that you fall not into the hands of your foes as men caught in the 
<A NAME="374"></A>meshes of a net, and they sack your fair city forthwith. Keep this before 
<A NAME="375"></A>your mind night and day, and beseech the captains of your allies to hold 
<A NAME="376"></A>on without flinching, and thus put away their reproaches from 
<A NAME="377"></A>you."
<A NAME="378"></A><BR><BR>So spoke Sarpedon, and Hector smarted under his words. He sprang 
<A NAME="379"></A>from his chariot clad in his suit of armour, and went about among the host 
<A NAME="380"></A>brandishing his two spears, exhorting the men to fight and raising the 
<A NAME="381"></A>terrible cry of battle. Then they rallied and again faced the Achaeans, 
<A NAME="382"></A>but the Argives stood compact and firm, and were not driven back. As the 
<A NAME="383"></A>breezes sport with the chaff upon some goodly threshing-floor, when men 
<A NAME="384"></A>are winnowing- while yellow Ceres blows with the wind to sift the chaff 
<A NAME="385"></A>from the grain, and the chaff- heaps grow whiter and whiter- even so did 
<A NAME="386"></A>the Achaeans whiten in the dust which the horses' hoofs raised to the firmament 
<A NAME="387"></A>of heaven, as their drivers turned them back to battle, and they bore down 
<A NAME="388"></A>with might upon the foe. Fierce Mars, to help the Trojans, covered them 
<A NAME="389"></A>in a veil of darkness, and went about everywhere among them, inasmuch as 
<A NAME="390"></A>Phoebus Apollo had told him that when he saw Pallas, Minerva leave the 
<A NAME="391"></A>fray he was to put courage into the hearts of the Trojans- for it was she 
<A NAME="392"></A>who was helping the Danaans. Then Apollo sent Aeneas forth from his rich 
<A NAME="393"></A>sanctuary, and filled his heart with valour, whereon he took his place 
<A NAME="394"></A>among his comrades, who were overjoyed at seeing him alive, sound, and 
<A NAME="395"></A>of a good courage; but they could not ask him how it had all happened, 
<A NAME="396"></A>for they were too busy with the turmoil raised by Mars and by Strife, who 
<A NAME="397"></A>raged insatiably in their midst.
<A NAME="398"></A><BR><BR>The two Ajaxes, Ulysses and Diomed, cheered the Danaans on, fearless 
<A NAME="399"></A>of the fury and onset of the Trojans. They stood as still as clouds which 
<A NAME="400"></A>the son of Saturn has spread upon the mountain tops when there is no air 
<A NAME="401"></A>and fierce Boreas sleeps with the other boisterous winds whose shrill blasts 
<A NAME="402"></A>scatter the clouds in all directions- even so did the Danaans stand firm 
<A NAME="403"></A>and unflinching against the Trojans. The son of Atreus went about among 
<A NAME="404"></A>them and exhorted them. "My friends," said he, "quit yourselves like brave 
<A NAME="405"></A>men, and shun dishonour in one another's eyes amid the stress of battle. 
<A NAME="406"></A>They that shun dishonour more often live than get killed, but they that 
<A NAME="407"></A>fly save neither life nor name."
<A NAME="408"></A><BR><BR>As he spoke he hurled his spear and hit one of those who were in 
<A NAME="409"></A>the front rank, the comrade of Aeneas, Deicoon son of Pergasus, whom the 
<A NAME="410"></A>Trojans held in no less honour than the sons of Priam, for he was ever 
<A NAME="411"></A>quick to place himself among the foremost. The spear of King Agamemnon 
<A NAME="412"></A>struck his shield and went right through it, for the shield stayed it not. 
<A NAME="413"></A>It drove through his belt into the lower part of his belly, and his armour 
<A NAME="414"></A>rang rattling round him as he fell heavily to the ground.
<A NAME="415"></A><BR><BR>Then Aeneas killed two champions of the Danaans, Crethon and Orsilochus. 
<A NAME="416"></A>Their father was a rich man who lived in the strong city of Phere and was 
<A NAME="417"></A>descended from the river Alpheus, whose broad stream flows through the 
<A NAME="418"></A>land of the Pylians. The river begat Orsilochus, who ruled over much people 
<A NAME="419"></A>and was father to Diocles, who in his turn begat twin sons, Crethon and 
<A NAME="420"></A>Orsilochus, well skilled in all the arts of war. These, when they grew 
<A NAME="421"></A>up, went to Ilius with the Argive fleet in the cause of Menelaus and Agamemnon 
<A NAME="422"></A>sons of Atreus, and there they both of them fell. As two lions whom their 
<A NAME="423"></A>dam has reared in the depths of some mountain forest to plunder homesteads 
<A NAME="424"></A>and carry off sheep and cattle till they get killed by the hand of man, 
<A NAME="425"></A>so were these two vanquished by Aeneas, and fell like high pine-trees to 
<A NAME="426"></A>the ground.
<A NAME="427"></A><BR><BR>Brave Menelaus pitied them in their fall, and made his way to the 
<A NAME="428"></A>front, clad in gleaming bronze and brandishing his spear, for Mars egged 
<A NAME="429"></A>him on to do so with intent that he should be killed by Aeneas; but Antilochus 
<A NAME="430"></A>the son of Nestor saw him and sprang forward, fearing that the king might 
<A NAME="431"></A>come to harm and thus bring all their labour to nothing; when, therefore 
<A NAME="432"></A>Aeneas and Menelaus were setting their hands and spears against one another 
<A NAME="433"></A>eager to do battle, Antilochus placed himself by the side of Menelaus. 
<A NAME="434"></A>Aeneas, bold though he was, drew back on seeing the two heroes side by 
<A NAME="435"></A>side in front of him, so they drew the bodies of Crethon and Orsilochus 
<A NAME="436"></A>to the ranks of the Achaeans and committed the two poor fellows into the 
<A NAME="437"></A>hands of their comrades. They then turned back and fought in the front 
<A NAME="438"></A>ranks.
<A NAME="439"></A><BR><BR>They killed Pylaemenes peer of Mars, leader of the Paphlagonian 
<A NAME="440"></A>warriors. Menelaus struck him on the collar-bone as he was standing on 
<A NAME="441"></A>his chariot, while Antilochus hit his charioteer and squire Mydon, the 
<A NAME="442"></A>son of Atymnius, who was turning his horses in flight. He hit him with 
<A NAME="443"></A>a stone upon the elbow, and the reins, enriched with white ivory, fell 
<A NAME="444"></A>from his hands into the dust. Antilochus rushed towards him and struck 
<A NAME="445"></A>him on the temples with his sword, whereon he fell head first from the 
<A NAME="446"></A>chariot to the ground. There he stood for a while with his head and shoulders 
<A NAME="447"></A>buried deep in the dust- for he had fallen on sandy soil till his horses 
<A NAME="448"></A>kicked him and laid him flat on the ground, as Antilochus lashed them and 
<A NAME="449"></A>drove them off to the host of the Achaeans.
<A NAME="450"></A><BR><BR>But Hector marked them from across the ranks, and with a loud cry 
<A NAME="451"></A>rushed towards them, followed by the strong battalions of the Trojans. 
<A NAME="452"></A>Mars and dread Enyo led them on, she fraught with ruthless turmoil of battle, 
<A NAME="453"></A>while Mars wielded a monstrous spear, and went about, now in front of Hector 
<A NAME="454"></A>and now behind him.
<A NAME="455"></A><BR><BR>Diomed shook with passion as he saw them. As a man crossing a wide 
<A NAME="456"></A>plain is dismayed to find himself on the brink of some great river rolling 
<A NAME="457"></A>swiftly to the sea- he sees its boiling waters and starts back in fear- 
<A NAME="458"></A>even so did the son of Tydeus give ground. Then he said to his men, "My 
<A NAME="459"></A>friends, how can we wonder that Hector wields the spear so well? Some god 
<A NAME="460"></A>is ever by his side to protect him, and now Mars is with him in the likeness 
<A NAME="461"></A>of mortal man. Keep your faces therefore towards the Trojans, but give 
<A NAME="462"></A>ground backwards, for we dare not fight with gods."
<A NAME="463"></A><BR><BR>As he spoke the Trojans drew close up, and Hector killed two men, 
<A NAME="464"></A>both in one chariot, Menesthes and Anchialus, heroes well versed in war. 
<A NAME="465"></A>Ajax son of Telamon pitied them in their fall; he came close up and hurled 
<A NAME="466"></A>his spear, hitting Amphius the son of Selagus, a man of great wealth who 
<A NAME="467"></A>lived in Paesus and owned much corn-growing land, but his lot had led him 
<A NAME="468"></A>to come to the aid of Priam and his sons. Ajax struck him in the belt; 
<A NAME="469"></A>the spear pierced the lower part of his belly, and he fell heavily to the 
<A NAME="470"></A>ground. Then Ajax ran towards him to strip him of his armour, but the Trojans 
<A NAME="471"></A>rained spears upon him, many of which fell upon his shield. He planted 
<A NAME="472"></A>his heel upon the body and drew out his spear, but the darts pressed so 
<A NAME="473"></A>heavily upon him that he could not strip the goodly armour from his shoulders. 
<A NAME="474"></A>The Trojan chieftains, moreover, many and valiant, came about him with 
<A NAME="475"></A>their spears, so that he dared not stay; great, brave and valiant though 
<A NAME="476"></A>he was, they drove him from them and he was beaten back.
<A NAME="477"></A><BR><BR>Thus, then, did the battle rage between them. Presently the strong 
<A NAME="478"></A>hand of fate impelled Tlepolemus, the son of Hercules, a man both brave 
<A NAME="479"></A>and of great stature, to fight Sarpedon; so the two, son and grandson of 
<A NAME="480"></A>great Jove, drew near to one another, and Tlepolemus spoke first. "Sarpedon," 
<A NAME="481"></A>said he, "councillor of the Lycians, why should you come skulking here 
<A NAME="482"></A>you who are a man of peace? They lie who call you son of aegis-bearing 
<A NAME="483"></A>Jove, for you are little like those who were of old his children. Far other 
<A NAME="484"></A>was Hercules, my own brave and lion-hearted father, who came here for the 
<A NAME="485"></A>horses of Laomedon, and though he had six ships only, and few men to follow 
<A NAME="486"></A>him, sacked the city of Ilius and made a wilderness of her highways. You 
<A NAME="487"></A>are a coward, and your people are falling from you. For all your strength, 
<A NAME="488"></A>and all your coming from Lycia, you will be no help to the Trojans but 
<A NAME="489"></A>will pass the gates of Hades vanquished by my hand."
<A NAME="490"></A><BR><BR>And Sarpedon, captain of the Lycians, answered, "Tlepolemus, your 
<A NAME="491"></A>father overthrew Ilius by reason of Laomedon's folly in refusing payment 
<A NAME="492"></A>to one who had served him well. He would not give your father the horses 
<A NAME="493"></A>which he had come so far to fetch. As for yourself, you shall meet death 
<A NAME="494"></A>by my spear. You shall yield glory to myself, and your soul to Hades of 
<A NAME="495"></A>the noble steeds."
<A NAME="496"></A><BR><BR>Thus spoke Sarpedon, and Tlepolemus upraised his spear. They threw 
<A NAME="497"></A>at the same moment, and Sarpedon struck his foe in the middle of his throat; 
<A NAME="498"></A>the spear went right through, and the darkness of death fell upon his eyes. 
<A NAME="499"></A>Tlepolemus's spear struck Sarpedon on the left thigh with such force that 
<A NAME="500"></A>it tore through the flesh and grazed the bone, but his father as yet warded 
<A NAME="501"></A>off destruction from him.
<A NAME="502"></A><BR><BR>His comrades bore Sarpedon out of the fight, in great pain by the 
<A NAME="503"></A>weight of the spear that was dragging from his wound. They were in such 
<A NAME="504"></A>haste and stress as they bore him that no one thought of drawing the spear 
<A NAME="505"></A>from his thigh so as to let him walk uprightly. Meanwhile the Achaeans 
<A NAME="506"></A>carried off the body of Tlepolemus, whereon Ulysses was moved to pity, 
<A NAME="507"></A>and panted for the fray as he beheld them. He doubted whether to pursue 
<A NAME="508"></A>the son of Jove, or to make slaughter of the Lycian rank and file; it was 
<A NAME="509"></A>not decreed, however, that he should slay the son of Jove; Minerva, therefore, 
<A NAME="510"></A>turned him against the main body of the Lycians. He killed Coeranus, Alastor, 
<A NAME="511"></A>Chromius, Alcandrus, Halius, Noemon, and Prytanis, and would have slain 
<A NAME="512"></A>yet more, had not great Hector marked him, and sped to the front of the 
<A NAME="513"></A>fight clad in his suit of mail, filling the Danaans with terror. Sarpedon 
<A NAME="514"></A>was glad when he saw him coming, and besought him, saying, "Son of Priam, 
<A NAME="515"></A>let me not he here to fall into the hands of the Danaans. Help me, and 
<A NAME="516"></A>since I may not return home to gladden the hearts of my wife and of my 
<A NAME="517"></A>infant son, let me die within the walls of your city."
<A NAME="518"></A><BR><BR>Hector made him no answer, but rushed onward to fall at once upon 
<A NAME="519"></A>the Achaeans and. kill many among them. His comrades then bore Sarpedon 
<A NAME="520"></A>away and laid him beneath Jove's spreading oak tree. Pelagon, his friend 
<A NAME="521"></A>and comrade drew the spear out of his thigh, but Sarpedon fainted and a 
<A NAME="522"></A>mist came over his eyes. Presently he came to himself again, for the breath 
<A NAME="523"></A>of the north wind as it played upon him gave him new life, and brought 
<A NAME="524"></A>him out of the deep swoon into which he had fallen.
<A NAME="525"></A><BR><BR>Meanwhile the Argives were neither driven towards their ships by 
<A NAME="526"></A>Mars and Hector, nor yet did they attack them; when they knew that Mars 
<A NAME="527"></A>was with the Trojans they retreated, but kept their faces still turned 
<A NAME="528"></A>towards the foe. Who, then, was first and who last to be slain by Mars 
<A NAME="529"></A>and Hector? They were valiant Teuthras, and Orestes the renowned charioteer, 
<A NAME="530"></A>Trechus the Aetolian warrior, Oenomaus, Helenus the son of Oenops, and 
<A NAME="531"></A>Oresbius of the gleaming girdle, who was possessed of great wealth, and 
<A NAME="532"></A>dwelt by the Cephisian lake with the other Boeotians who lived near him, 
<A NAME="533"></A>owners of a fertile country.
<A NAME="534"></A><BR><BR>Now when the goddess Juno saw the Argives thus falling, she said 
<A NAME="535"></A>to Minerva, "Alas, daughter of aegis-bearing Jove, unweariable, the promise 
<A NAME="536"></A>we made Menelaus that he should not return till he had sacked the city 
<A NAME="537"></A>of Ilius will be of none effect if we let Mars rage thus furiously. Let 
<A NAME="538"></A>us go into the fray at once."
<A NAME="539"></A><BR><BR>Minerva did not gainsay her. Thereon the august goddess, daughter 
<A NAME="540"></A>of great Saturn, began to harness her gold-bedizened steeds. Hebe with 
<A NAME="541"></A>all speed fitted on the eight-spoked wheels of bronze that were on either 
<A NAME="542"></A>side of the iron axle-tree. The felloes of the wheels were of gold, imperishable, 
<A NAME="543"></A>and over these there was a tire of bronze, wondrous to behold. The naves 
<A NAME="544"></A>of the wheels were silver, turning round the axle upon either side. The 
<A NAME="545"></A>car itself was made with plaited bands of gold and silver, and it had a 
<A NAME="546"></A>double top-rail running all round it. From the body of the car there went 
<A NAME="547"></A>a pole of silver, on to the end of which she bound the golden yoke, with 
<A NAME="548"></A>the bands of gold that were to go under the necks of the horses Then Juno 
<A NAME="549"></A>put her steeds under the yoke, eager for battle and the 
<A NAME="550"></A>war-cry.
<A NAME="551"></A><BR><BR>Meanwhile Minerva flung her richly embroidered vesture, made with 
<A NAME="552"></A>her own hands, on to her father's threshold, and donned the shirt of Jove, 
<A NAME="553"></A>arming herself for battle. She threw her tasselled aegis about. her shoulders, 
<A NAME="554"></A>wreathed round with Rout as with a fringe, and on it were Strife, and Strength, 
<A NAME="555"></A>and Panic whose blood runs cold; moreover there was the head of the dread 
<A NAME="556"></A>monster Gorgon,, grim and awful to behold, portent of aegis-bearing Jove. 
<A NAME="557"></A>On her head she set her helmet of gold, with four plumes, and coming to 
<A NAME="558"></A>a peak both in front and behind- decked with the emblems of a hundred cities; 
<A NAME="559"></A>then she stepped into her flaming chariot and grasped the spear, so stout 
<A NAME="560"></A>and sturdy and strong, with which she quells the ranks of heroes who have 
<A NAME="561"></A>displeased her. Juno lashed the horses on, and the gates of heaven bellowed 
<A NAME="562"></A>as they flew open of their own accord -gates over which the flours preside, 
<A NAME="563"></A>in whose hands are Heaven and Olympus, either to open the dense cloud that 
<A NAME="564"></A>hides them, or to close it. Through these the goddesses drove their obedient 
<A NAME="565"></A>steeds, and found the son of Saturn sitting all alone on the topmost ridges 
<A NAME="566"></A>of Olympus. There Juno stayed her horses, and spoke to Jove the son of 
<A NAME="567"></A>Saturn, lord of all. "Father Jove," said she, "are you not angry with Mars 
<A NAME="568"></A>for these high doings? how great and goodly a host of the Achaeans he has 
<A NAME="569"></A>destroyed to my great grief, and without either right or reason, while 
<A NAME="570"></A>the Cyprian and Apollo are enjoying it all at their ease and setting this 
<A NAME="571"></A>unrighteous madman on to do further mischief. I hope, Father Jove, that 
<A NAME="572"></A>you will not be angry if I hit Mars hard, and chase him out of the 
<A NAME="573"></A>battle."
<A NAME="574"></A><BR><BR>And Jove answered, "Set Minerva on to him, for she punishes him 
<A NAME="575"></A>more often than any one else does."
<A NAME="576"></A><BR><BR>Juno did as he had said. She lashed her horses, and they flew forward 
<A NAME="577"></A>nothing loth midway betwixt earth and sky. As far as a man can see when 
<A NAME="578"></A>he looks out upon the sea from some high beacon, so far can the loud-neighing 
<A NAME="579"></A>horses of the gods spring at a single bound. When they reached Troy and 
<A NAME="580"></A>the place where its two flowing streams Simois and Scamander meet, there 
<A NAME="581"></A>Juno stayed them and took them from the chariot. She hid them in a thick 
<A NAME="582"></A>cloud, and Simois made ambrosia spring up for them to eat; the two goddesses 
<A NAME="583"></A>then went on, flying like turtledoves in their eagerness to help the Argives. 
<A NAME="584"></A>When they came to the part where the bravest and most in number were gathered 
<A NAME="585"></A>about mighty Diomed, fighting like lions or wild boars of great strength 
<A NAME="586"></A>and endurance, there Juno stood still and raised a shout like that of brazen-voiced 
<A NAME="587"></A>Stentor, whose cry was as loud as that of fifty men together. "Argives," 
<A NAME="588"></A>she cried; "shame on cowardly creatures, brave in semblance only; as long 
<A NAME="589"></A>as Achilles was fighting, fi his spear was so deadly that the Trojans dared 
<A NAME="590"></A>not show themselves outside the Dardanian gates, but now they sally far 
<A NAME="591"></A>from the city and fight even at your ships."
<A NAME="592"></A><BR><BR>With these words she put heart and soul into them all, while Minerva 
<A NAME="593"></A>sprang to the side of the son of Tydeus, whom she found near his chariot 
<A NAME="594"></A>and horses, cooling the wound that Pandarus had given him. For the sweat 
<A NAME="595"></A>caused by the hand that bore the weight of his shield irritated the hurt: 
<A NAME="596"></A>his arm was weary with pain, and he was lifting up the strap to wipe away 
<A NAME="597"></A>the blood. The goddess laid her hand on the yoke of his horses and said, 
<A NAME="598"></A>"The son of Tydeus is not such another as his father. Tydeus was a little 
<A NAME="599"></A>man, but he could fight, and rushed madly into the fray even when I told 
<A NAME="600"></A>him not to do so. When he went all unattended as envoy to the city of Thebes 
<A NAME="601"></A>among the Cadmeans, I bade him feast in their houses and be at peace; but 
<A NAME="602"></A>with that high spirit which was ever present with him, he challenged the 
<A NAME="603"></A>youth of the Cadmeans, and at once beat them in all that he attempted, 
<A NAME="604"></A>so mightily did I help him. I stand by you too to protect you, and I bid 
<A NAME="605"></A>you be instant in fighting the Trojans; but either you are tired out, or 
<A NAME="606"></A>you are afraid and out of heart, and in that case I say that you are no 
<A NAME="607"></A>true son of Tydeus the son of Oeneus."
<A NAME="608"></A><BR><BR>Diomed answered, "I know you, goddess, daughter of aegis-bearing 
<A NAME="609"></A>Jove, and will hide nothing from you. I am not afraid nor out of heart, 
<A NAME="610"></A>nor is there any slackness in me. I am only following your own instructions; 
<A NAME="611"></A>you told me not to fight any of the blessed gods; but if Jove's daughter 
<A NAME="612"></A>Venus came into battle I was to wound her with my spear. Therefore I am 
<A NAME="613"></A>retreating, and bidding the other Argives gather in this place, for I know 
<A NAME="614"></A>that Mars is now lording it in the field."
<A NAME="615"></A><BR><BR>"Diomed, son of Tydeus," replied Minerva, "man after my own heart, 
<A NAME="616"></A>fear neither Mars nor any other of the immortals, for I will befriend you. 
<A NAME="617"></A>Nay, drive straight at Mars, and smite him in close combat; fear not this 
<A NAME="618"></A>raging madman, villain incarnate, first on one side and then on the other. 
<A NAME="619"></A>But now he was holding talk with Juno and myself, saying he would help 
<A NAME="620"></A>the Argives and attack the Trojans; nevertheless he is with the Trojans, 
<A NAME="621"></A>and has forgotten the Argives."
<A NAME="622"></A><BR><BR>With this she caught hold of Sthenelus and lifted him off the chariot 
<A NAME="623"></A>on to the ground. In a second he was on the ground, whereupon the goddess 
<A NAME="624"></A>mounted the car and placed herself by the side of Diomed. The oaken axle 
<A NAME="625"></A>groaned aloud under the burden of the awful goddess and the hero; Pallas 
<A NAME="626"></A>Minerva took the whip and reins, and drove straight at Mars. He was in 
<A NAME="627"></A>the act of stripping huge Periphas, son of Ochesius and bravest of the 
<A NAME="628"></A>Aetolians. Bloody Mars was stripping him of his armour, and Minerva donned 
<A NAME="629"></A>the helmet of Hades, that he might not see her; when, therefore, he saw 
<A NAME="630"></A>Diomed, he made straight for him and let Periphas lie where he had fallen. 
<A NAME="631"></A>As soon as they were at close quarters he let fly with his bronze spear 
<A NAME="632"></A>over the reins and yoke, thinking to take Diomed's life, but Minerva caught 
<A NAME="633"></A>the spear in her hand and made it fly harmlessly over the chariot. Diomed 
<A NAME="634"></A>then threw, and Pallas Minerva drove the spear into the pit of Mars's stomach 
<A NAME="635"></A>where his under-girdle went round him. There Diomed wounded him, tearing 
<A NAME="636"></A>his fair flesh and then drawing his spear out again. Mars roared as loudly 
<A NAME="637"></A>as nine or ten thousand men in the thick of a fight, and the Achaeans and 
<A NAME="638"></A>Trojans were struck with panic, so terrible was the cry he 
<A NAME="639"></A>raised.
<A NAME="640"></A><BR><BR>As a dark cloud in the sky when it comes on to blow after heat, 
<A NAME="641"></A>even so did Diomed son of Tydeus see Mars ascend into the broad heavens. 
<A NAME="642"></A>With all speed he reached high Olympus, home of the gods, and in great 
<A NAME="643"></A>pain sat down beside Jove the son of Saturn. He showed Jove the immortal 
<A NAME="644"></A>blood that was flowing from his wound, and spoke piteously, saying, "Father 
<A NAME="645"></A>Jove, are you not angered by such doings? We gods are continually suffering 
<A NAME="646"></A>in the most cruel manner at one another's hands while helping mortals; 
<A NAME="647"></A>and we all owe you a grudge for having begotten that mad termagant of a 
<A NAME="648"></A>daughter, who is always committing outrage of some kind. We other gods 
<A NAME="649"></A>must all do as you bid us, but her you neither scold nor punish; you encourage 
<A NAME="650"></A>her because the pestilent creature is your daughter. See how she has been 
<A NAME="651"></A>inciting proud Diomed to vent his rage on the immortal gods. First he went 
<A NAME="652"></A>up to the Cyprian and wounded her in the hand near her wrist, and then 
<A NAME="653"></A>he sprang upon me too as though he were a god. Had I not run for it I must 
<A NAME="654"></A>either have lain there for long enough in torments among the ghastly corpes, 
<A NAME="655"></A>or have been eaten alive with spears till I had no more strength left in 
<A NAME="656"></A>me."
<A NAME="657"></A><BR><BR>Jove looked angrily at him and said, "Do not come whining here, 
<A NAME="658"></A>Sir Facing-bothways. I hate you worst of all the gods in Olympus, for you 
<A NAME="659"></A>are ever fighting and making mischief. You have the intolerable and stubborn 
<A NAME="660"></A>spirit of your mother Juno: it is all I can do to manage her, and it is 
<A NAME="661"></A>her doing that you are now in this plight: still, I cannot let you remain 
<A NAME="662"></A>longer in such great pain; you are my own off-spring, and it was by me 
<A NAME="663"></A>that your mother conceived you; if, however, you had been the son of any 
<A NAME="664"></A>other god, you are so destructive that by this time you should have been 
<A NAME="665"></A>lying lower than the Titans."
<A NAME="666"></A><BR><BR>He then bade Paeeon heal him, whereon Paeeon spread pain-killing 
<A NAME="667"></A>herbs upon his wound and cured him, for he was not of mortal mould. As 
<A NAME="668"></A>the juice of the fig-tree curdles milk, and thickens it in a moment though 
<A NAME="669"></A>it is liquid, even so instantly did Paeeon cure fierce Mars. Then Hebe 
<A NAME="670"></A>washed him, and clothed him in goodly raiment, and he took his seat by 
<A NAME="671"></A>his father Jove all glorious to behold.
<A NAME="672"></A><BR><BR>But Juno of Argos and Minerva of Alalcomene, now that they had 
<A NAME="673"></A>put a stop to the murderous doings of Mars, went back again to the house 
<A NAME="674"></A>of Jove.
