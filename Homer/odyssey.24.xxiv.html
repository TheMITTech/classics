<A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A>Then Mercury of Cyllene summoned the ghosts of the suitors, and in his 
<A NAME="11"></A>hand he held the fair golden wand with which he seals men's eyes in sleep 
<A NAME="12"></A>or wakes them just as he pleases; with this he roused the ghosts and led 
<A NAME="13"></A>them, while they followed whining and gibbering behind him. As bats fly 
<A NAME="14"></A>squealing in the hollow of some great cave, when one of them has fallen 
<A NAME="15"></A>out of the cluster in which they hang, even so did the ghosts whine and 
<A NAME="16"></A>squeal as Mercury the healer of sorrow led them down into the dark abode 
<A NAME="17"></A>of death. When they had passed the waters of Oceanus and the rock Leucas, 
<A NAME="18"></A>they came to the gates of the sun and the land of dreams, whereon they 
<A NAME="19"></A>reached the meadow of asphodel where dwell the souls and shadows of them 
<A NAME="20"></A>that can labour no more.
<A NAME="21"></A><BR><BR>Here they found the ghost of Achilles son of Peleus, with those 
<A NAME="22"></A>of Patroclus, Antilochus, and Ajax, who was the finest and handsomest man 
<A NAME="23"></A>of all the Danaans after the son of Peleus himself.
<A NAME="24"></A><BR><BR>They gathered round the ghost of the son of Peleus, and the ghost 
<A NAME="25"></A>of Agamemnon joined them, sorrowing bitterly. Round him were gathered also 
<A NAME="26"></A>the ghosts of those who had perished with him in the house of Aeisthus; 
<A NAME="27"></A>and the ghost of Achilles spoke first.
<A NAME="28"></A><BR><BR>"Son of Atreus," it said, "we used to say that Jove had loved you 
<A NAME="29"></A>better from first to last than any other hero, for you were captain over 
<A NAME="30"></A>many and brave men, when we were all fighting together before Troy; yet 
<A NAME="31"></A>the hand of death, which no mortal can escape, was laid upon you all too 
<A NAME="32"></A>early. Better for you had you fallen at Troy in the hey-day of your renown, 
<A NAME="33"></A>for the Achaeans would have built a mound over your ashes, and your son 
<A NAME="34"></A>would have been heir to your good name, whereas it has now been your lot 
<A NAME="35"></A>to come to a most miserable end."
<A NAME="36"></A><BR><BR>"Happy son of Peleus," answered the ghost of Agamemnon, "for having 
<A NAME="37"></A>died at Troy far from Argos, while the bravest of the Trojans and the Achaeans 
<A NAME="38"></A>fell round you fighting for your body. There you lay in the whirling clouds 
<A NAME="39"></A>of dust, all huge and hugely, heedless now of your chivalry. We fought 
<A NAME="40"></A>the whole of the livelong day, nor should we ever have left off if Jove 
<A NAME="41"></A>had not sent a hurricane to stay us. Then, when we had borne you to the 
<A NAME="42"></A>ships out of the fray, we laid you on your bed and cleansed your fair skin 
<A NAME="43"></A>with warm water and with ointments. The Danaans tore their hair and wept 
<A NAME="44"></A>bitterly round about you. Your mother, when she heard, came with her immortal 
<A NAME="45"></A>nymphs from out of the sea, and the sound of a great wailing went forth 
<A NAME="46"></A>over the waters so that the Achaeans quaked for fear. They would have fled 
<A NAME="47"></A>panic-stricken to their ships had not wise old Nestor whose counsel was 
<A NAME="48"></A>ever truest checked them saying, 'Hold, Argives, fly not sons of the Achaeans, 
<A NAME="49"></A>this is his mother coming from the sea with her immortal nymphs to view 
<A NAME="50"></A>the body of her son.'
<A NAME="51"></A><BR><BR>"Thus he spoke, and the Achaeans feared no more. The daughters 
<A NAME="52"></A>of the old man of the sea stood round you weeping bitterly, and clothed 
<A NAME="53"></A>you in immortal raiment. The nine muses also came and lifted up their sweet 
<A NAME="54"></A>voices in lament- calling and answering one another; there was not an Argive 
<A NAME="55"></A>but wept for pity of the dirge they chaunted. Days and nights seven and 
<A NAME="56"></A>ten we mourned you, mortals and immortals, but on the eighteenth day we 
<A NAME="57"></A>gave you to the flames, and many a fat sheep with many an ox did we slay 
<A NAME="58"></A>in sacrifice around you. You were burnt in raiment of the gods, with rich 
<A NAME="59"></A>resins and with honey, while heroes, horse and foot, clashed their armour 
<A NAME="60"></A>round the pile as you were burning, with the tramp as of a great multitude. 
<A NAME="61"></A>But when the flames of heaven had done their work, we gathered your white 
<A NAME="62"></A>bones at daybreak and laid them in ointments and in pure wine. Your mother 
<A NAME="63"></A>brought us a golden vase to hold them- gift of Bacchus, and work of Vulcan 
<A NAME="64"></A>himself; in this we mingled your bleached bones with those of Patroclus 
<A NAME="65"></A>who had gone before you, and separate we enclosed also those of Antilochus, 
<A NAME="66"></A>who had been closer to you than any other of your comrades now that Patroclus 
<A NAME="67"></A>was no more.
<A NAME="68"></A><BR><BR>"Over these the host of the Argives built a noble tomb, on a point 
<A NAME="69"></A>jutting out over the open Hellespont, that it might be seen from far out 
<A NAME="70"></A>upon the sea by those now living and by them that shall be born hereafter. 
<A NAME="71"></A>Your mother begged prizes from the gods, and offered them to be contended 
<A NAME="72"></A>for by the noblest of the Achaeans. You must have been present at the funeral 
<A NAME="73"></A>of many a hero, when the young men gird themselves and make ready to contend 
<A NAME="74"></A>for prizes on the death of some great chieftain, but you never saw such 
<A NAME="75"></A>prizes as silver-footed Thetis offered in your honour; for the gods loved 
<A NAME="76"></A>you well. Thus even in death your fame, Achilles, has not been lost, and 
<A NAME="77"></A>your name lives evermore among all mankind. But as for me, what solace 
<A NAME="78"></A>had I when the days of my fighting were done? For Jove willed my destruction 
<A NAME="79"></A>on my return, by the hands of Aegisthus and those of my wicked 
<A NAME="80"></A>wife."
<A NAME="81"></A><BR><BR>Thus did they converse, and presently Mercury came up to them with 
<A NAME="82"></A>the ghosts of the suitors who had been killed by Ulysses. The ghosts of 
<A NAME="83"></A>Agamemnon and Achilles were astonished at seeing them, and went up to them 
<A NAME="84"></A>at once. The ghost of Agamemnon recognized Amphimedon son of Melaneus, 
<A NAME="85"></A>who lived in Ithaca and had been his host, so it began to talk to 
<A NAME="86"></A>him.
<A NAME="87"></A><BR><BR>"Amphimedon," it said, "what has happened to all you fine young 
<A NAME="88"></A>men- all of an age too- that you are come down here under the ground? One 
<A NAME="89"></A>could pick no finer body of men from any city. Did Neptune raise his winds 
<A NAME="90"></A>and waves against you when you were at sea, or did your enemies make an 
<A NAME="91"></A>end of you on the mainland when you were cattle-lifting or sheep-stealing, 
<A NAME="92"></A>or while fighting in defence of their wives and city? Answer my question, 
<A NAME="93"></A>for I have been your guest. Do you not remember how I came to your house 
<A NAME="94"></A>with Menelaus, to persuade Ulysses to join us with his ships against Troy? 
<A NAME="95"></A>It was a whole month ere we could resume our voyage, for we had hard work 
<A NAME="96"></A>to persuade Ulysses to come with us."
<A NAME="97"></A><BR><BR>And the ghost of Amphimedon answered, "Agamemnon, son of Atreus, 
<A NAME="98"></A>king of men, I remember everything that you have said, and will tell you 
<A NAME="99"></A>fully and accurately about the way in which our end was brought about. 
<A NAME="100"></A>Ulysses had been long gone, and we were courting his wife, who did not 
<A NAME="101"></A>say point blank that she would not marry, nor yet bring matters to an end, 
<A NAME="102"></A>for she meant to compass our destruction: this, then, was the trick she 
<A NAME="103"></A>played us. She set up a great tambour frame in her room and began to work 
<A NAME="104"></A>on an enormous piece of fine needlework. 'Sweethearts,' said she, 'Ulysses 
<A NAME="105"></A>is indeed dead, still, do not press me to marry again immediately; wait- 
<A NAME="106"></A>for I would not have my skill in needlework perish unrecorded- till I have 
<A NAME="107"></A>completed a pall for the hero Laertes, against the time when death shall 
<A NAME="108"></A>take him. He is very rich, and the women of the place will talk if he is 
<A NAME="109"></A>laid out without a pall.' This is what she said, and we assented; whereupon 
<A NAME="110"></A>we could see her working upon her great web all day long, but at night 
<A NAME="111"></A>she would unpick the stitches again by torchlight. She fooled us in this 
<A NAME="112"></A>way for three years without our finding it out, but as time wore on and 
<A NAME="113"></A>she was now in her fourth year, in the waning of moons and many days had 
<A NAME="114"></A>been accomplished, one of her maids who knew what she was doing told us, 
<A NAME="115"></A>and we caught her in the act of undoing her work, so she had to finish 
<A NAME="116"></A>it whether she would or no; and when she showed us the robe she had made, 
<A NAME="117"></A>after she had had it washed, its splendour was as that of the sun or 
<A NAME="118"></A>moon.
<A NAME="119"></A><BR><BR>"Then some malicious god conveyed Ulysses to the upland farm where 
<A NAME="120"></A>his swineherd lives. Thither presently came also his son, returning from 
<A NAME="121"></A>a voyage to Pylos, and the two came to the town when they had hatched their 
<A NAME="122"></A>plot for our destruction. Telemachus came first, and then after him, accompanied 
<A NAME="123"></A>by the swineherd, came Ulysses, clad in rags and leaning on a staff as 
<A NAME="124"></A>though he were some miserable old beggar. He came so unexpectedly that 
<A NAME="125"></A>none of us knew him, not even the older ones among us, and we reviled him 
<A NAME="126"></A>and threw things at him. He endured both being struck and insulted without 
<A NAME="127"></A>a word, though he was in his own house; but when the will of Aegis-bearing 
<A NAME="128"></A>Jove inspired him, he and Telemachus took the armour and hid it in an inner 
<A NAME="129"></A>chamber, bolting the doors behind them. Then he cunningly made his wife 
<A NAME="130"></A>offer his bow and a quantity of iron to be contended for by us ill-fated 
<A NAME="131"></A>suitors; and this was the beginning of our end, for not one of us could 
<A NAME="132"></A>string the bow- nor nearly do so. When it was about to reach the hands 
<A NAME="133"></A>of Ulysses, we all of us shouted out that it should not be given him, no 
<A NAME="134"></A>matter what he might say, but Telemachus insisted on his having it. When 
<A NAME="135"></A>he had got it in his hands he strung it with ease and sent his arrow through 
<A NAME="136"></A>the iron. Then he stood on the floor of the cloister and poured his arrows 
<A NAME="137"></A>on the ground, glaring fiercely about him. First he killed Antinous, and 
<A NAME="138"></A>then, aiming straight before him, he let fly his deadly darts and they 
<A NAME="139"></A>fell thick on one another. It was plain that some one of the gods was helping 
<A NAME="140"></A>them, for they fell upon us with might and main throughout the cloisters, 
<A NAME="141"></A>and there was a hideous sound of groaning as our brains were being battered 
<A NAME="142"></A>in, and the ground seethed with our blood. This, Agamemnon, is how we came 
<A NAME="143"></A>by our end, and our bodies are lying still un-cared for in the house of 
<A NAME="144"></A>Ulysses, for our friends at home do not yet know what has happened, so 
<A NAME="145"></A>that they cannot lay us out and wash the black blood from our wounds, making 
<A NAME="146"></A>moan over us according to the offices due to the departed."
<A NAME="147"></A><BR><BR>"Happy Ulysses, son of Laertes," replied the ghost of Agamemnon, 
<A NAME="148"></A>"you are indeed blessed in the possession of a wife endowed with such rare 
<A NAME="149"></A>excellence of understanding, and so faithful to her wedded lord as Penelope 
<A NAME="150"></A>the daughter of Icarius. The fame, therefore, of her virtue shall never 
<A NAME="151"></A>die, and the immortals shall compose a song that shall be welcome to all 
<A NAME="152"></A>mankind in honour of the constancy of Penelope. How far otherwise was the 
<A NAME="153"></A>wickedness of the daughter of Tyndareus who killed her lawful husband; 
<A NAME="154"></A>her song shall be hateful among men, for she has brought disgrace on all 
<A NAME="155"></A>womankind even on the good ones."
<A NAME="156"></A><BR><BR>Thus did they converse in the house of Hades deep down within the 
<A NAME="157"></A>bowels of the earth. Meanwhile Ulysses and the others passed out of the 
<A NAME="158"></A>town and soon reached the fair and well-tilled farm of Laertes, which he 
<A NAME="159"></A>had reclaimed with infinite labour. Here was his house, with a lean-to 
<A NAME="160"></A>running all round it, where the slaves who worked for him slept and sat 
<A NAME="161"></A>and ate, while inside the house there was an old Sicel woman, who looked 
<A NAME="162"></A>after him in this his country-farm. When Ulysses got there, he said to 
<A NAME="163"></A>his son and to the other two:
<A NAME="164"></A><BR><BR>"Go to the house, and kill the best pig that you can find for dinner. 
<A NAME="165"></A>Meanwhile I want to see whether my father will know me, or fail to recognize 
<A NAME="166"></A>me after so long an absence."
<A NAME="167"></A><BR><BR>He then took off his armour and gave it to Eumaeus and Philoetius, 
<A NAME="168"></A>who went straight on to the house, while he turned off into the vineyard 
<A NAME="169"></A>to make trial of his father. As he went down into the great orchard, he 
<A NAME="170"></A>did not see Dolius, nor any of his sons nor of the other bondsmen, for 
<A NAME="171"></A>they were all gathering thorns to make a fence for the vineyard, at the 
<A NAME="172"></A>place where the old man had told them; he therefore found his father alone, 
<A NAME="173"></A>hoeing a vine. He had on a dirty old shirt, patched and very shabby; his 
<A NAME="174"></A>legs were bound round with thongs of oxhide to save him from the brambles, 
<A NAME="175"></A>and he also wore sleeves of leather; he had a goat skin cap on his head, 
<A NAME="176"></A>and was looking very woe-begone. When Ulysses saw him so worn, so old and 
<A NAME="177"></A>full of sorrow, he stood still under a tall pear tree and began to weep. 
<A NAME="178"></A>He doubted whether to embrace him, kiss him, and tell him all about his 
<A NAME="179"></A>having come home, or whether he should first question him and see what 
<A NAME="180"></A>he would say. In the end he deemed it best to be crafty with him, so in 
<A NAME="181"></A>this mind he went up to his father, who was bending down and digging about 
<A NAME="182"></A>a plant.
<A NAME="183"></A><BR><BR>"I see, sir," said Ulysses, "that you are an excellent gardener- 
<A NAME="184"></A>what pains you take with it, to be sure. There is not a single plant, not 
<A NAME="185"></A>a fig tree, vine, olive, pear, nor flower bed, but bears the trace of your 
<A NAME="186"></A>attention. I trust, however, that you will not be offended if I say that 
<A NAME="187"></A>you take better care of your garden than of yourself. You are old, unsavoury, 
<A NAME="188"></A>and very meanly clad. It cannot be because you are idle that your master 
<A NAME="189"></A>takes such poor care of you, indeed your face and figure have nothing of 
<A NAME="190"></A>the slave about them, and proclaim you of noble birth. I should have said 
<A NAME="191"></A>that you were one of those who should wash well, eat well, and lie soft 
<A NAME="192"></A>at night as old men have a right to do; but tell me, and tell me true, 
<A NAME="193"></A>whose bondman are you, and in whose garden are you working? Tell me also 
<A NAME="194"></A>about another matter. Is this place that I have come to really Ithaca? 
<A NAME="195"></A>I met a man just now who said so, but he was a dull fellow, and had not 
<A NAME="196"></A>the patience to hear my story out when I was asking him about an old friend 
<A NAME="197"></A>of mine, whether he was still living, or was already dead and in the house 
<A NAME="198"></A>of Hades. Believe me when I tell you that this man came to my house once 
<A NAME="199"></A>when I was in my own country and never yet did any stranger come to me 
<A NAME="200"></A>whom I liked better. He said that his family came from Ithaca and that 
<A NAME="201"></A>his father was Laertes, son of Arceisius. I received him hospitably, making 
<A NAME="202"></A>him welcome to all the abundance of my house, and when he went away I gave 
<A NAME="203"></A>him all customary presents. I gave him seven talents of fine gold, and 
<A NAME="204"></A>a cup of solid silver with flowers chased upon it. I gave him twelve light 
<A NAME="205"></A>cloaks, and as many pieces of tapestry; I also gave him twelve cloaks of 
<A NAME="206"></A>single fold, twelve rugs, twelve fair mantles, and an equal number of shirts. 
<A NAME="207"></A>To all this I added four good looking women skilled in all useful arts, 
<A NAME="208"></A>and I let him take his choice."
<A NAME="209"></A><BR><BR>His father shed tears and answered, "Sir, you have indeed come 
<A NAME="210"></A>to the country that you have named, but it is fallen into the hands of 
<A NAME="211"></A>wicked people. All this wealth of presents has been given to no purpose. 
<A NAME="212"></A>If you could have found your friend here alive in Ithaca, he would have 
<A NAME="213"></A>entertained you hospitably and would have required your presents amply 
<A NAME="214"></A>when you left him- as would have been only right considering what you have 
<A NAME="215"></A>already given him. But tell me, and tell me true, how many years is it 
<A NAME="216"></A>since you entertained this guest- my unhappy son, as ever was? Alas! He 
<A NAME="217"></A>has perished far from his own country; the fishes of the sea have eaten 
<A NAME="218"></A>him, or he has fallen a prey to the birds and wild beasts of some continent. 
<A NAME="219"></A>Neither his mother, nor I his father, who were his parents, could throw 
<A NAME="220"></A>our arms about him and wrap him in his shroud, nor could his excellent 
<A NAME="221"></A>and richly dowered wife Penelope bewail her husband as was natural upon 
<A NAME="222"></A>his death bed, and close his eyes according to the offices due to the departed. 
<A NAME="223"></A>But now, tell me truly for I want to know. Who and whence are you- tell 
<A NAME="224"></A>me of your town and parents? Where is the ship lying that has brought you 
<A NAME="225"></A>and your men to Ithaca? Or were you a passenger on some other man's ship, 
<A NAME="226"></A>and those who brought you here have gone on their way and left 
<A NAME="227"></A>you?"
<A NAME="228"></A><BR><BR>"I will tell you everything," answered Ulysses, "quite truly. I 
<A NAME="229"></A>come from Alybas, where I have a fine house. I am son of king Apheidas, 
<A NAME="230"></A>who is the son of Polypemon. My own name is Eperitus; heaven drove me off 
<A NAME="231"></A>my course as I was leaving Sicania, and I have been carried here against 
<A NAME="232"></A>my will. As for my ship it is lying over yonder, off the open country outside 
<A NAME="233"></A>the town, and this is the fifth year since Ulysses left my country. Poor 
<A NAME="234"></A>fellow, yet the omens were good for him when he left me. The birds all 
<A NAME="235"></A>flew on our right hands, and both he and I rejoiced to see them as we parted, 
<A NAME="236"></A>for we had every hope that we should have another friendly meeting and 
<A NAME="237"></A>exchange presents."
<A NAME="238"></A><BR><BR>A dark cloud of sorrow fell upon Laertes as he listened. He filled 
<A NAME="239"></A>both hands with the dust from off the ground and poured it over his grey 
<A NAME="240"></A>head, groaning heavily as he did so. The heart of Ulysses was touched, 
<A NAME="241"></A>and his nostrils quivered as he looked upon his father; then he sprang 
<A NAME="242"></A>towards him, flung his arms about him and kissed him, saying, "I am he, 
<A NAME="243"></A>father, about whom you are asking- I have returned after having been away 
<A NAME="244"></A>for twenty years. But cease your sighing and lamentation- we have no time 
<A NAME="245"></A>to lose, for I should tell you that I have been killing the suitors in 
<A NAME="246"></A>my house, to punish them for their insolence and crimes."
<A NAME="247"></A><BR><BR>"If you really are my son Ulysses," replied Laertes, "and have 
<A NAME="248"></A>come back again, you must give me such manifest proof of your identity 
<A NAME="249"></A>as shall convince me."
<A NAME="250"></A><BR><BR>"First observe this scar," answered Ulysses, "which I got from 
<A NAME="251"></A>a boar's tusk when I was hunting on Mount Parnassus. You and my mother 
<A NAME="252"></A>had sent me to Autolycus, my mother's father, to receive the presents which 
<A NAME="253"></A>when he was over here he had promised to give me. Furthermore I will point 
<A NAME="254"></A>out to you the trees in the vineyard which you gave me, and I asked you 
<A NAME="255"></A>all about them as I followed you round the garden. We went over them all, 
<A NAME="256"></A>and you told me their names and what they all were. You gave me thirteen 
<A NAME="257"></A>pear trees, ten apple trees, and forty fig trees; you also said you would 
<A NAME="258"></A>give me fifty rows of vines; there was corn planted between each row, and 
<A NAME="259"></A>they yield grapes of every kind when the heat of heaven has been laid heavy 
<A NAME="260"></A>upon them."
<A NAME="261"></A><BR><BR>Laertes' strength failed him when he heard the convincing proofs 
<A NAME="262"></A>which his son had given him. He threw his arms about him, and Ulysses had 
<A NAME="263"></A>to support him, or he would have gone off into a swoon; but as soon as 
<A NAME="264"></A>he came to, and was beginning to recover his senses, he said, "O father 
<A NAME="265"></A>Jove, then you gods are still in Olympus after all, if the suitors have 
<A NAME="266"></A>really been punished for their insolence and folly. Nevertheless, I am 
<A NAME="267"></A>much afraid that I shall have all the townspeople of Ithaca up here directly, 
<A NAME="268"></A>and they will be sending messengers everywhere throughout the cities of 
<A NAME="269"></A>the Cephallenians."
<A NAME="270"></A><BR><BR>Ulysses answered, "Take heart and do not trouble yourself about 
<A NAME="271"></A>that, but let us go into the house hard by your garden. I have already 
<A NAME="272"></A>told Telemachus, Philoetius, and Eumaeus to go on there and get dinner 
<A NAME="273"></A>ready as soon as possible."
<A NAME="274"></A><BR><BR>Thus conversing the two made their way towards the house. When 
<A NAME="275"></A>they got there they found Telemachus with the stockman and the swineherd 
<A NAME="276"></A>cutting up meat and mixing wine with water. Then the old Sicel woman took 
<A NAME="277"></A>Laertes inside and washed him and anointed him with oil. She put him on 
<A NAME="278"></A>a good cloak, and Minerva came up to him and gave him a more imposing presence, 
<A NAME="279"></A>making him taller and stouter than before. When he came back his son was 
<A NAME="280"></A>surprised to see him looking so like an immortal, and said to him, "My 
<A NAME="281"></A>dear father, some one of the gods has been making you much taller and 
<A NAME="282"></A>better-looking."
<A NAME="283"></A><BR><BR>Laertes answered, "Would, by Father Jove, Minerva, and Apollo, 
<A NAME="284"></A>that I were the man I was when I ruled among the Cephallenians, and took 
<A NAME="285"></A>Nericum, that strong fortress on the foreland. If I were still what I then 
<A NAME="286"></A>was and had been in our house yesterday with my armour on, I should have 
<A NAME="287"></A>been able to stand by you and help you against the suitors. I should have 
<A NAME="288"></A>killed a great many of them, and you would have rejoiced to see 
<A NAME="289"></A>it."
<A NAME="290"></A><BR><BR>Thus did they converse; but the others, when they had finished 
<A NAME="291"></A>their work and the feast was ready, left off working, and took each his 
<A NAME="292"></A>proper place on the benches and seats. Then they began eating; by and by 
<A NAME="293"></A>old Dolius and his sons left their work and came up, for their mother, 
<A NAME="294"></A>the Sicel woman who looked after Laertes now that he was growing old, had 
<A NAME="295"></A>been to fetch them. When they saw Ulysses and were certain it was he, they 
<A NAME="296"></A>stood there lost in astonishment; but Ulysses scolded them good-naturedly 
<A NAME="297"></A>and said, "Sit down to your dinner, old man, and never mind about your 
<A NAME="298"></A>surprise; we have been wanting to begin for some time and have been waiting 
<A NAME="299"></A>for you."
<A NAME="300"></A><BR><BR>Then Dolius put out both his hands and went up to Ulysses. "Sir," 
<A NAME="301"></A>said he, seizing his master's hand and kissing it at the wrist, "we have 
<A NAME="302"></A>long been wishing you home: and now heaven has restored you to us after 
<A NAME="303"></A>we had given up hoping. All hail, therefore, and may the gods prosper you. 
<A NAME="304"></A>But tell me, does Penelope already know of your return, or shall we send 
<A NAME="305"></A>some one to tell her?"
<A NAME="306"></A><BR><BR>"Old man," answered Ulysses, "she knows already, so you need not 
<A NAME="307"></A>trouble about that." On this he took his seat, and the sons of Dolius gathered 
<A NAME="308"></A>round Ulysses to give him greeting and embrace him one after the other; 
<A NAME="309"></A>then they took their seats in due order near Dolius their 
<A NAME="310"></A>father.
<A NAME="311"></A><BR><BR>While they were thus busy getting their dinner ready, Rumour went 
<A NAME="312"></A>round the town, and noised abroad the terrible fate that had befallen the 
<A NAME="313"></A>suitors; as soon, therefore, as the people heard of it they gathered from 
<A NAME="314"></A>every quarter, groaning and hooting before the house of Ulysses. They took 
<A NAME="315"></A>the dead away, buried every man his own, and put the bodies of those who 
<A NAME="316"></A>came from elsewhere on board the fishing vessels, for the fishermen to 
<A NAME="317"></A>take each of them to his own place. They then met angrily in the place 
<A NAME="318"></A>of assembly, and when they were got together Eupeithes rose to speak. He 
<A NAME="319"></A>was overwhelmed with grief for the death of his son Antinous, who had been 
<A NAME="320"></A>the first man killed by Ulysses, so he said, weeping bitterly, "My friend, 
<A NAME="321"></A>this man has done the Achaeans great wrong. He took many of our best men 
<A NAME="322"></A>away with him in his fleet, and he has lost both ships and men; now, moreover, 
<A NAME="323"></A>on his return he has been killing all the foremost men among the Cephallenians. 
<A NAME="324"></A>Let us be up and doing before he can get away to Pylos or to Elis where 
<A NAME="325"></A>the Epeans rule, or we shall be ashamed of ourselves for ever afterwards. 
<A NAME="326"></A>It will be an everlasting disgrace to us if we do not avenge the murder 
<A NAME="327"></A>of our sons and brothers. For my own part I should have no mote pleasure 
<A NAME="328"></A>in life, but had rather die at once. Let us be up, then, and after them, 
<A NAME="329"></A>before they can cross over to the mainland."
<A NAME="330"></A><BR><BR>He wept as he spoke and every one pitied him. But Medon and the 
<A NAME="331"></A>bard Phemius had now woke up, and came to them from the house of Ulysses. 
<A NAME="332"></A>Every one was astonished at seeing them, but they stood in the middle of 
<A NAME="333"></A>the assembly, and Medon said, "Hear me, men of Ithaca. Ulysses did not 
<A NAME="334"></A>do these things against the will of heaven. I myself saw an immortal god 
<A NAME="335"></A>take the form of Mentor and stand beside him. This god appeared, now in 
<A NAME="336"></A>front of him encouraging him, and now going furiously about the court and 
<A NAME="337"></A>attacking the suitors whereon they fell thick on one 
<A NAME="338"></A>another."
<A NAME="339"></A><BR><BR>On this pale fear laid hold of them, and old Halitherses, son of 
<A NAME="340"></A>Mastor, rose to speak, for he was the only man among them who knew both 
<A NAME="341"></A>past and future; so he spoke to them plainly and in all honesty, 
<A NAME="342"></A>saying,
<A NAME="343"></A><BR><BR>"Men of Ithaca, it is all your own fault that things have turned 
<A NAME="344"></A>out as they have; you would not listen to me, nor yet to Mentor, when we 
<A NAME="345"></A>bade you check the folly of your sons who were doing much wrong in the 
<A NAME="346"></A>wantonness of their hearts- wasting the substance and dishonouring the 
<A NAME="347"></A>wife of a chieftain who they thought would not return. Now, however, let 
<A NAME="348"></A>it be as I say, and do as I tell you. Do not go out against Ulysses, or 
<A NAME="349"></A>you may find that you have been drawing down evil on your own 
<A NAME="350"></A>heads."
<A NAME="351"></A><BR><BR>This was what he said, and more than half raised a loud shout, 
<A NAME="352"></A>and at once left the assembly. But the rest stayed where they were, for 
<A NAME="353"></A>the speech of Halitherses displeased them, and they sided with Eupeithes; 
<A NAME="354"></A>they therefore hurried off for their armour, and when they had armed themselves, 
<A NAME="355"></A>they met together in front of the city, and Eupeithes led them on in their 
<A NAME="356"></A>folly. He thought he was going to avenge the murder of his son, whereas 
<A NAME="357"></A>in truth he was never to return, but was himself to perish in his 
<A NAME="358"></A>attempt.
<A NAME="359"></A><BR><BR>Then Minerva said to Jove, "Father, son of Saturn, king of kings, 
<A NAME="360"></A>answer me this question- What do you propose to do? Will you set them fighting 
<A NAME="361"></A>still further, or will you make peace between them?"
<A NAME="362"></A><BR><BR>And Jove answered, "My child, why should you ask me? Was it not 
<A NAME="363"></A>by your own arrangement that Ulysses came home and took his revenge upon 
<A NAME="364"></A>the suitors? Do whatever you like, but I will tell you what I think will 
<A NAME="365"></A>be most reasonable arrangement. Now that Ulysses is revenged, let them 
<A NAME="366"></A>swear to a solemn covenant, in virtue of which he shall continue to rule, 
<A NAME="367"></A>while we cause the others to forgive and forget the massacre of their sons 
<A NAME="368"></A>and brothers. Let them then all become friends as heretofore, and let peace 
<A NAME="369"></A>and plenty reign."
<A NAME="370"></A><BR><BR>This was what Minerva was already eager to bring about, so down 
<A NAME="371"></A>she darted from off the topmost summits of Olympus.
<A NAME="372"></A><BR><BR>Now when Laertes and the others had done dinner, Ulysses began 
<A NAME="373"></A>by saying, "Some of you go out and see if they are not getting close up 
<A NAME="374"></A>to us." So one of Dolius's sons went as he was bid. Standing on the threshold 
<A NAME="375"></A>he could see them all quite near, and said to Ulysses, "Here they are, 
<A NAME="376"></A>let us put on our armour at once."
<A NAME="377"></A><BR><BR>They put on their armour as fast as they could- that is to say 
<A NAME="378"></A>Ulysses, his three men, and the six sons of Dolius. Laertes also and Dolius 
<A NAME="379"></A>did the same- warriors by necessity in spite of their grey hair. When they 
<A NAME="380"></A>had all put on their armour, they opened the gate and sallied forth, Ulysses 
<A NAME="381"></A>leading the way.
<A NAME="382"></A><BR><BR>Then Jove's daughter Minerva came up to them, having assumed the 
<A NAME="383"></A>form and voice of Mentor. Ulysses was glad when he saw her, and said to 
<A NAME="384"></A>his son Telemachus, "Telemachus, now that are about to fight in an engagement, 
<A NAME="385"></A>which will show every man's mettle, be sure not to disgrace your ancestors, 
<A NAME="386"></A>who were eminent for their strength and courage all the world 
<A NAME="387"></A>over."
<A NAME="388"></A><BR><BR>"You say truly, my dear father," answered Telemachus, "and you 
<A NAME="389"></A>shall see, if you will, that I am in no mind to disgrace your 
<A NAME="390"></A>family."
<A NAME="391"></A><BR><BR>Laertes was delighted when he heard this. "Good heavens, he exclaimed, 
<A NAME="392"></A>"what a day I am enjoying: I do indeed rejoice at it. My son and grandson 
<A NAME="393"></A>are vying with one another in the matter of valour."
<A NAME="394"></A><BR><BR>On this Minerva came close up to him and said, "Son of Arceisius- 
<A NAME="395"></A>best friend I have in the world- pray to the blue-eyed damsel, and to Jove 
<A NAME="396"></A>her father; then poise your spear and hurl it."
<A NAME="397"></A><BR><BR>As she spoke she infused fresh vigour into him, and when he had 
<A NAME="398"></A>prayed to her he poised his spear and hurled it. He hit Eupeithes' helmet, 
<A NAME="399"></A>and the spear went right through it, for the helmet stayed it not, and 
<A NAME="400"></A>his armour rang rattling round him as he fell heavily to the ground. Meantime 
<A NAME="401"></A>Ulysses and his son fell the front line of the foe and smote them with 
<A NAME="402"></A>their swords and spears; indeed, they would have killed every one of them, 
<A NAME="403"></A>and prevented them from ever getting home again, only Minerva raised her 
<A NAME="404"></A>voice aloud, and made every one pause. "Men of Ithaca," she cried, cease 
<A NAME="405"></A>this dreadful war, and settle the matter at once without further 
<A NAME="406"></A>bloodshed."
<A NAME="407"></A><BR><BR>On this pale fear seized every one; they were so frightened that 
<A NAME="408"></A>their arms dropped from their hands and fell upon the ground at the sound 
<A NAME="409"></A>of the goddess's voice, and they fled back to the city for their lives. 
<A NAME="410"></A>But Ulysses gave a great cry, and gathering himself together swooped down 
<A NAME="411"></A>like a soaring eagle. Then the son of Saturn sent a thunderbolt of fire 
<A NAME="412"></A>that fell just in front of Minerva, so she said to Ulysses, "Ulysses, noble 
<A NAME="413"></A>son of Laertes, stop this warful strife, or Jove will be angry with 
<A NAME="414"></A>you."
<A NAME="415"></A><BR><BR>Thus spoke Minerva, and Ulysses obeyed her gladly. Then Minerva 
<A NAME="416"></A>assumed the form and voice of Mentor, and presently made a covenant of 
<A NAME="417"></A>peace between the two contending parties.
