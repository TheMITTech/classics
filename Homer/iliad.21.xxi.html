<A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A>Now when they came to the ford of the full-flowing river Xanthus, begotten 
<A NAME="11"></A>of immortal Jove, Achilles cut their forces in two: one half he chased 
<A NAME="12"></A>over the plain towards the city by the same way that the Achaeans had taken 
<A NAME="13"></A>when flying panic-stricken on the preceding day with Hector in full triumph; 
<A NAME="14"></A>this way did they fly pell-mell, and Juno sent down a thick mist in front 
<A NAME="15"></A>of them to stay them. The other half were hemmed in by the deep silver-eddying 
<A NAME="16"></A>stream, and fell into it with a great uproar. The waters resounded, and 
<A NAME="17"></A>the banks rang again, as they swam hither and thither with loud cries amid 
<A NAME="18"></A>the whirling eddies. As locusts flying to a river before the blast of a 
<A NAME="19"></A>grass fire- the flame comes on and on till at last it overtakes them and 
<A NAME="20"></A>they huddle into the water- even so was the eddying stream of Xanthus filled 
<A NAME="21"></A>with the uproar of men and horses, all struggling in confusion before 
<A NAME="22"></A>Achilles.
<A NAME="23"></A><BR><BR>Forthwith the hero left his spear upon the bank, leaning it against 
<A NAME="24"></A>a tamarisk bush, and plunged into the river like a god, armed with his 
<A NAME="25"></A>sword only. Fell was his purpose as he hewed the Trojans down on every 
<A NAME="26"></A>side. Their dying groans rose hideous as the sword smote them, and the 
<A NAME="27"></A>river ran red with blood. As when fish fly scared before a huge dolphin, 
<A NAME="28"></A>and fill every nook and corner of some fair haven- for he is sure to eat 
<A NAME="29"></A>all he can catch- even so did the Trojans cower under the banks of the 
<A NAME="30"></A>mighty river, and when Achilles' arms grew weary with killing them, he 
<A NAME="31"></A>drew twelve youths alive out of the water, to sacrifice in revenge for 
<A NAME="32"></A>Patroclus son of Menoetius. He drew them out like dazed fawns, bound their 
<A NAME="33"></A>hands behind them with the girdles of their own shirts, and gave them over 
<A NAME="34"></A>to his men to take back to the ships. Then he sprang into the river, thirsting 
<A NAME="35"></A>for still further blood.
<A NAME="36"></A><BR><BR>There he found Lycaon, son of Priam seed of Dardanus, as he was 
<A NAME="37"></A>escaping out of the water; he it was whom he had once taken prisoner when 
<A NAME="38"></A>he was in his father's vineyard, having set upon him by night, as he was 
<A NAME="39"></A>cutting young shoots from a wild fig-tree to make the wicker sides of a 
<A NAME="40"></A>chariot. Achilles then caught him to his sorrow unawares, and sent him 
<A NAME="41"></A>by sea to Lemnos, where the son of Jason bought him. But a guest-friend, 
<A NAME="42"></A>Eetion of Imbros, freed him with a great sum, and sent him to Arisbe, whence 
<A NAME="43"></A>he had escaped and returned to his father's house. He had spent eleven 
<A NAME="44"></A>days happily with his friends after he had come from Lemnos, but on the 
<A NAME="45"></A>twelfth heaven again delivered him into the hands of Achilles, who was 
<A NAME="46"></A>to send him to the house of Hades sorely against his will. He was unarmed 
<A NAME="47"></A>when Achilles caught sight of him, and had neither helmet nor shield; nor 
<A NAME="48"></A>yet had he any spear, for he had thrown all his armour from him on to the 
<A NAME="49"></A>bank, and was sweating with his struggles to get out of the river, so that 
<A NAME="50"></A>his strength was now failing him.
<A NAME="51"></A><BR><BR>Then Achilles said to himself in his surprise, "What marvel do 
<A NAME="52"></A>I see here? If this man can come back alive after having been sold over 
<A NAME="53"></A>into Lemnos, I shall have the Trojans also whom I have slain rising from 
<A NAME="54"></A>the world below. Could not even the waters of the grey sea imprison him, 
<A NAME="55"></A>as they do many another whether he will or no? This time let him taste 
<A NAME="56"></A>my spear, that I may know for certain whether mother earth who can keep 
<A NAME="57"></A>even a strong man down, will be able to hold him, or whether thence too 
<A NAME="58"></A>he will return."
<A NAME="59"></A><BR><BR>Thus did he pause and ponder. But Lycaon came up to him dazed and 
<A NAME="60"></A>trying hard to embrace his knees, for he would fain live, not die. Achilles 
<A NAME="61"></A>thrust at him with his spear, meaning to kill him, but Lycaon ran crouching 
<A NAME="62"></A>up to him and caught his knees, whereby the spear passed over his back, 
<A NAME="63"></A>and stuck in the ground, hungering though it was for blood. With one hand 
<A NAME="64"></A>he caught Achilles' knees as he besought him, and with the other he clutched 
<A NAME="65"></A>the spear and would not let it go. Then he said, "Achilles, have mercy 
<A NAME="66"></A>upon me and spare me, for I am your suppliant. It was in your tents that 
<A NAME="67"></A>I first broke bread on the day when you took me prisoner in the vineyard; 
<A NAME="68"></A>after which you sold away to Lemnos far from my father and my friends, 
<A NAME="69"></A>and I brought you the price of a hundred oxen. I have paid three times 
<A NAME="70"></A>as much to gain my freedom; it is but twelve days that I have come to Ilius 
<A NAME="71"></A>after much suffering, and now cruel fate has again thrown me into your 
<A NAME="72"></A>hands. Surely father Jove must hate me, that he has given me over to you 
<A NAME="73"></A>a second time. Short of life indeed did my mother Laothoe bear me, daughter 
<A NAME="74"></A>of aged Altes- of Altes who reigns over the warlike Lelegae and holds steep 
<A NAME="75"></A>Pedasus on the river Satnioeis. Priam married his daughter along with many 
<A NAME="76"></A>other women and two sons were born of her, both of whom you will have slain. 
<A NAME="77"></A>Your spear slew noble Polydorus as he was fighting in the front ranks, 
<A NAME="78"></A>and now evil will here befall me, for I fear that I shall not escape you 
<A NAME="79"></A>since heaven has delivered me over to you. Furthermore I say, and lay my 
<A NAME="80"></A>saying to your heart, spare me, for I am not of the same womb as Hector 
<A NAME="81"></A>who slew your brave and noble comrade."
<A NAME="82"></A><BR><BR>With such words did the princely son of Priam beseech Achilles; 
<A NAME="83"></A>but Achilles answered him sternly. "Idiot," said he, "talk not to me of 
<A NAME="84"></A>ransom. Until Patroclus fell I preferred to give the Trojans quarter, and 
<A NAME="85"></A>sold beyond the sea many of those whom I had taken alive; but now not a 
<A NAME="86"></A>man shall live of those whom heaven delivers into my hands before the city 
<A NAME="87"></A>of Ilius- and of all Trojans it shall fare hardest with the sons of Priam. 
<A NAME="88"></A>Therefore, my friend, you too shall die. Why should you whine in this way? 
<A NAME="89"></A>Patroclus fell, and he was a better man than you are. I too- see you not 
<A NAME="90"></A>how I am great and goodly? I am son to a noble father, and have a goddess 
<A NAME="91"></A>for my mother, but the hands of doom and death overshadow me all as surely. 
<A NAME="92"></A>The day will come, either at dawn or dark, or at the noontide, when one 
<A NAME="93"></A>shall take my life also in battle, either with his spear, or with an arrow 
<A NAME="94"></A>sped from his bow."
<A NAME="95"></A><BR><BR>Thus did he speak, and Lycaon's heart sank within him. He loosed 
<A NAME="96"></A>his hold of the spear, and held out both hands before him; but Achilles 
<A NAME="97"></A>drew his keen blade, and struck him by the collar-bone on his neck; he 
<A NAME="98"></A>plunged his two-edged sword into him to the very hilt, whereon he lay at 
<A NAME="99"></A>full length on the ground, with the dark blood welling from him till the 
<A NAME="100"></A>earth was soaked. Then Achilles caught him by the foot and flung him into 
<A NAME="101"></A>the river to go down stream, vaunting over him the while, and saying, "Lie 
<A NAME="102"></A>there among the fishes, who will lick the blood from your wound and gloat 
<A NAME="103"></A>over it; your mother shall not lay you on any bier to mourn you, but the 
<A NAME="104"></A>eddies of Scamander shall bear you into the broad bosom of the sea. There 
<A NAME="105"></A>shall the fishes feed on the fat of Lycaon as they dart under the dark 
<A NAME="106"></A>ripple of the waters- so perish all of you till we reach the citadel of 
<A NAME="107"></A>strong Ilius- you in flight, and I following after to destroy you. The 
<A NAME="108"></A>river with its broad silver stream shall serve you in no stead, for all 
<A NAME="109"></A>the bulls you offered him and all the horses that you flung living into 
<A NAME="110"></A>his waters. None the less miserably shall you perish till there is not 
<A NAME="111"></A>a man of you but has paid in full for the death of Patroclus and the havoc 
<A NAME="112"></A>you wrought among the Achaeans whom you have slain while I held aloof from 
<A NAME="113"></A>battle."
<A NAME="114"></A><BR><BR>So spoke Achilles, but the river grew more and more angry, and 
<A NAME="115"></A>pondered within himself how he should stay the hand of Achilles and save 
<A NAME="116"></A>the Trojans from disaster. Meanwhile the son of Peleus, spear in hand, 
<A NAME="117"></A>sprang upon Asteropaeus son of Pelegon to kill him. He was son to the broad 
<A NAME="118"></A>river Axius and Periboea eldest daughter of Acessamenus; for the river 
<A NAME="119"></A>had lain with her. Asteropaeus stood up out of the water to face him with 
<A NAME="120"></A>a spear in either hand, and Xanthus filled him with courage, being angry 
<A NAME="121"></A>for the death of the youths whom Achilles was slaying ruthlessly within 
<A NAME="122"></A>his waters. When they were close up with one another Achilles was first 
<A NAME="123"></A>to speak. "Who and whence are you," said he, "who dare to face me? Woe 
<A NAME="124"></A>to the parents whose son stands up against me." And the son of Pelegon 
<A NAME="125"></A>answered, "Great son of Peleus, why should you ask my lineage. I am from 
<A NAME="126"></A>the fertile land of far Paeonia, captain of the Paeonians, and it is now 
<A NAME="127"></A>eleven days that I am at Ilius. I am of the blood of the river Axius- of 
<A NAME="128"></A>Axius that is the fairest of all rivers that run. He begot the famed warrior 
<A NAME="129"></A>Pelegon, whose son men call me. Let us now fight, Achilles."
<A NAME="130"></A><BR><BR>Thus did he defy him, and Achilles raised his spear of Pelian ash. 
<A NAME="131"></A>Asteropaeus failed with both his spears, for he could use both hands alike; 
<A NAME="132"></A>with the one spear he struck Achilles' shield, but did not pierce it, for 
<A NAME="133"></A>the layer of gold, gift of the god, stayed the point; with the other spear 
<A NAME="134"></A>he grazed the elbow of Achilles! right arm drawing dark blood, but the 
<A NAME="135"></A>spear itself went by him and fixed itself in the ground, foiled of its 
<A NAME="136"></A>bloody banquet. Then Achilles, fain to kill him, hurled his spear at Asteropaeus, 
<A NAME="137"></A>but failed to hit him and struck the steep bank of the river, driving the 
<A NAME="138"></A>spear half its length into the earth. The son of Peleus then drew his sword 
<A NAME="139"></A>and sprang furiously upon him. Asteropaeus vainly tried to draw Achilles' 
<A NAME="140"></A>spear out of the bank by main force; thrice did he tug at it, trying with 
<A NAME="141"></A>all his might to draw it out, and thrice he had to leave off trying; the 
<A NAME="142"></A>fourth time he tried to bend and break it, but ere he could do so Achilles 
<A NAME="143"></A>smote him with his sword and killed him. He struck him in the belly near 
<A NAME="144"></A>the navel, so that all his bowels came gushing out on to the ground, and 
<A NAME="145"></A>the darkness of death came over him as he lay gasping. Then Achilles set 
<A NAME="146"></A>his foot on his chest and spoiled him of his armour, vaunting over him 
<A NAME="147"></A>and saying, "Lie there- begotten of a river though you be, it is hard for 
<A NAME="148"></A>you to strive with the offspring of Saturn's son. You declare yourself 
<A NAME="149"></A>sprung from the blood of a broad river, but I am of the seed of mighty 
<A NAME="150"></A>Jove. My father is Peleus, son of Aeacus ruler over the many Myrmidons, 
<A NAME="151"></A>and Aeacus was the son of Jove. Therefore as Jove is mightier than any 
<A NAME="152"></A>river that flows into the sea, so are his children stronger than those 
<A NAME="153"></A>of any river whatsoever. Moreover you have a great river hard by if he 
<A NAME="154"></A>can be of any use to you, but there is no fighting against Jove the son 
<A NAME="155"></A>of Saturn, with whom not even King Achelous can compare, nor the mighty 
<A NAME="156"></A>stream of deep-flowing Oceanus, from whom all rivers and seas with all 
<A NAME="157"></A>springs and deep wells proceed; even Oceanus fears the lightnings of great 
<A NAME="158"></A>Jove, and his thunder that comes crashing out of heaven."
<A NAME="159"></A><BR><BR>With this he drew his bronze spear out of the bank, and now that 
<A NAME="160"></A>he had killed Asteropaeus, he let him lie where he was on the sand, with 
<A NAME="161"></A>the dark water flowing over him and the eels and fishes busy nibbling and 
<A NAME="162"></A>gnawing the fat that was about his kidneys. Then he went in chase of the 
<A NAME="163"></A>Paeonians, who were flying along the bank of the river in panic when they 
<A NAME="164"></A>saw their leader slain by the hands of the son of Peleus. Therein he slew 
<A NAME="165"></A>Thersilochus, Mydon, Astypylus, Mnesus, Thrasius, Oeneus, and Ophelestes, 
<A NAME="166"></A>and he would have slain yet others, had not the river in anger taken human 
<A NAME="167"></A>form, and spoken to him from out the deep waters saying, "Achilles, if 
<A NAME="168"></A>you excel all in strength, so do you also in wickedness, for the gods are 
<A NAME="169"></A>ever with you to protect you: if, then, the son of Saturn has vouchsafed 
<A NAME="170"></A>it to you to destroy all the Trojans, at any rate drive them out of my 
<A NAME="171"></A>stream, and do your grim work on land. My fair waters are now filled with 
<A NAME="172"></A>corpses, nor can I find any channel by which I may pour myself into the 
<A NAME="173"></A>sea for I am choked with dead, and yet you go on mercilessly slaying. I 
<A NAME="174"></A>am in despair, therefore, O captain of your host, trouble me no 
<A NAME="175"></A>further."
<A NAME="176"></A><BR><BR>Achilles answered, "So be it, Scamander, Jove-descended; but I 
<A NAME="177"></A>will never cease dealing out death among the Trojans, till I have pent 
<A NAME="178"></A>them up in their city, and made trial of Hector face to face, that I may 
<A NAME="179"></A>learn whether he is to vanquish me, or I him."
<A NAME="180"></A><BR><BR>As he spoke he set upon the Trojans with a fury like that of the 
<A NAME="181"></A>gods. But the river said to Apollo, "Surely, son of Jove, lord of the silver 
<A NAME="182"></A>bow, you are not obeying the commands of Jove who charged you straitly 
<A NAME="183"></A>that you should stand by the Trojans and defend them, till twilight fades, 
<A NAME="184"></A>and darkness is over an the earth."
<A NAME="185"></A><BR><BR>Meanwhile Achilles sprang from the bank into mid-stream, whereon 
<A NAME="186"></A>the river raised a high wave and attacked him. He swelled his stream into 
<A NAME="187"></A>a torrent, and swept away the many dead whom Achilles had slain and left 
<A NAME="188"></A>within his waters. These he cast out on to the land, bellowing like a bull 
<A NAME="189"></A>the while, but the living he saved alive, hiding them in his mighty eddies. 
<A NAME="190"></A>The great and terrible wave gathered about Achilles, falling upon him and 
<A NAME="191"></A>beating on his shield, so that he could not keep his feet; he caught hold 
<A NAME="192"></A>of a great elm-tree, but it came up by the roots, and tore away the bank, 
<A NAME="193"></A>damming the stream with its thick branches and bridging it all across; 
<A NAME="194"></A>whereby Achilles struggled out of the stream, and fled full speed over 
<A NAME="195"></A>the plain, for he was afraid.
<A NAME="196"></A><BR><BR>But the mighty god ceased not in his pursuit, and sprang upon him 
<A NAME="197"></A>with a dark-crested wave, to stay his hands and save the Trojans from destruction. 
<A NAME="198"></A>The son of Peleus darted away a spear's throw from him; swift as the swoop 
<A NAME="199"></A>of a black hunter-eagle which is the strongest and fleetest of all birds, 
<A NAME="200"></A>even so did he spring forward, and the armour rang loudly about his breast. 
<A NAME="201"></A>He fled on in front, but the river with a loud roar came tearing after. 
<A NAME="202"></A>As one who would water his garden leads a stream from some fountain over 
<A NAME="203"></A>his plants, and all his ground-spade in hand he clears away the dams to 
<A NAME="204"></A>free the channels, and the little stones run rolling round and round with 
<A NAME="205"></A>the water as it goes merrily down the bank faster than the man can follow- 
<A NAME="206"></A>even so did the river keep catching up with Achilles albeit he was a fleet 
<A NAME="207"></A>runner, for the gods are stronger than men. As often as he would strive 
<A NAME="208"></A>to stand his ground, and see whether or no all the gods in heaven were 
<A NAME="209"></A>in league against him, so often would the mighty wave come beating down 
<A NAME="210"></A>upon his shoulders, and be would have to keep flying on and on in great 
<A NAME="211"></A>dismay; for the angry flood was tiring him out as it flowed past him and 
<A NAME="212"></A>ate the ground from under his feet.
<A NAME="213"></A><BR><BR>Then the son of Peleus lifted up his voice to heaven saying, "Father 
<A NAME="214"></A>Jove, is there none of the gods who will take pity upon me, and save me 
<A NAME="215"></A>from the river? I do not care what may happen to me afterwards. I blame 
<A NAME="216"></A>none of the other dwellers on Olympus so severely as I do my dear mother, 
<A NAME="217"></A>who has beguiled and tricked me. She told me I was to fall under the walls 
<A NAME="218"></A>of Troy by the flying arrows of Apollo; would that Hector, the best man 
<A NAME="219"></A>among the Trojans, might there slay me; then should I fall a hero by the 
<A NAME="220"></A>hand of a hero; whereas now it seems that I shall come to a most pitiable 
<A NAME="221"></A>end, trapped in this river as though I were some swineherd's boy, who gets 
<A NAME="222"></A>carried down a torrent while trying to cross it during a 
<A NAME="223"></A>storm."
<A NAME="224"></A><BR><BR>As soon as he had spoken thus, Neptune and Minerva came up to him 
<A NAME="225"></A>in the likeness of two men, and took him by the hand to reassure him. Neptune 
<A NAME="226"></A>spoke first. "Son of Peleus," said he, "be not so exceeding fearful; we 
<A NAME="227"></A>are two gods, come with Jove's sanction to assist you, I, and Pallas Minerva. 
<A NAME="228"></A>It is not your fate to perish in this river; he will abate presently as 
<A NAME="229"></A>you will see; moreover we strongly advise you, if you will be guided by 
<A NAME="230"></A>us, not to stay your hand from fighting till you have pent the Trojan host 
<A NAME="231"></A>within the famed walls of Ilius- as many of them as may escape. Then kill 
<A NAME="232"></A>Hector and go back to the ships, for we will vouchsafe you a triumph over 
<A NAME="233"></A>him."
<A NAME="234"></A><BR><BR>When they had so said they went back to the other immortals, but 
<A NAME="235"></A>Achilles strove onward over the plain, encouraged by the charge the gods 
<A NAME="236"></A>had laid upon him. All was now covered with the flood of waters, and much 
<A NAME="237"></A>goodly armour of the youths that had been slain was rifting about, as also 
<A NAME="238"></A>many corpses, but he forced his way against the stream, speeding right 
<A NAME="239"></A>onwards, nor could the broad waters stay him, for Minerva had endowed him 
<A NAME="240"></A>with great strength. Nevertheless Scamander did not slacken in his pursuit, 
<A NAME="241"></A>but was still more furious with the son of Peleus. He lifted his waters 
<A NAME="242"></A>into a high crest and cried aloud to Simois saying, "Dear brother, let 
<A NAME="243"></A>the two of us unite to save this man, or he will sack the mighty city of 
<A NAME="244"></A>King Priam, and the Trojans will not hold out against him. Help me at once; 
<A NAME="245"></A>fill your streams with water from their sources, rouse all your torrents 
<A NAME="246"></A>to a fury; raise your wave on high, and let snags and stones come thundering 
<A NAME="247"></A>down you that we may make an end of this savage creature who is now lording 
<A NAME="248"></A>it as though he were a god. Nothing shall serve him longer, not strength 
<A NAME="249"></A>nor comeliness, nor his fine armour, which forsooth shall soon be lying 
<A NAME="250"></A>low in the deep waters covered over with mud. I will wrap him in sand, 
<A NAME="251"></A>and pour tons of shingle round him, so that the Achaeans shall not know 
<A NAME="252"></A>how to gather his bones for the silt in which I shall have hidden him, 
<A NAME="253"></A>and when they celebrate his funeral they need build no 
<A NAME="254"></A>barrow."
<A NAME="255"></A><BR><BR>On this he upraised his tumultuous flood high against Achilles, 
<A NAME="256"></A>seething as it was with foam and blood and the bo&ies of the dead. The 
<A NAME="257"></A>dark waters of the river stood upright and would have overwhelmed the son 
<A NAME="258"></A>of Peleus, but Juno, trembling lest Achilles should be swept away in the 
<A NAME="259"></A>mighty torrent, lifted her voice on high and called out to Vulcan her son. 
<A NAME="260"></A>"Crook-foot," she cried, "my child, be up and doing, for I deem it is with 
<A NAME="261"></A>you that Xanthus is fain to fight; help us at once, kindle a fierce fire; 
<A NAME="262"></A>I will then bring up the west and the white south wind in a mighty hurricane 
<A NAME="263"></A>from the sea, that shall bear the flames against the heads and armour of 
<A NAME="264"></A>the Trojans and consume them, while you go along the banks of Xanthus burning 
<A NAME="265"></A>his trees and wrapping him round with fire. Let him not turn you back neither 
<A NAME="266"></A>by fair words nor foul, and slacken not till I shout and tell you. Then 
<A NAME="267"></A>you may stay your flames."
<A NAME="268"></A><BR><BR>On this Vulcan kindled a fierce fire, which broke out first upon 
<A NAME="269"></A>the plain and burned the many dead whom Achilles had killed and whose bodies 
<A NAME="270"></A>were lying about in great numbers; by this means the plain was dried and 
<A NAME="271"></A>the flood stayed. As the north wind, blowing on an orchard that has been 
<A NAME="272"></A>sodden with autumn rain, soon dries it, and the heart of the owner is glad- 
<A NAME="273"></A>even so the whole plan was dried and the dead bodies were consumed. Then 
<A NAME="274"></A>he turned tongues of fire on to the river. He burned the elms the willows 
<A NAME="275"></A>and the tamarisks, the lotus also, with the rushes and marshy herbage that 
<A NAME="276"></A>grew abundantly by the banks of the river. The eels and fishes that go 
<A NAME="277"></A>darting about everywhere in the water, these, too, were sorely harassed 
<A NAME="278"></A>by the flames that cunning Vulcan had kindled, and the river himself was 
<A NAME="279"></A>scalded, so that he spoke saying, "Vulcan, there is no god can hold his 
<A NAME="280"></A>own against you. I cannot fight you when you flare out your flames in this 
<A NAME="281"></A>way; strive with me no longer. Let Achilles drive the Trojans out of city 
<A NAME="282"></A>immediately. What have I to do with quarrelling and helping 
<A NAME="283"></A>people?"
<A NAME="284"></A><BR><BR>He was boiling as he spoke, and all his waters were seething. As 
<A NAME="285"></A>a cauldron upon 'a large fire boils when it is melting the lard of some 
<A NAME="286"></A>fatted hog, and the lard keeps bubbling up all over when the dry faggots 
<A NAME="287"></A>blaze under it- even so were the goodly waters of Xanthus heated with the 
<A NAME="288"></A>fire till they were boiling. He could flow no longer but stayed his stream, 
<A NAME="289"></A>so afflicted was he by the blasts of fire which cunning Vulcan had raised. 
<A NAME="290"></A>Then he prayed to Juno and besought her saying, "Juno, why should your 
<A NAME="291"></A>son vex my stream with such especial fury? I am not so much to blame as 
<A NAME="292"></A>all the others are who have been helping the Trojans. I will leave off, 
<A NAME="293"></A>since you so desire it, and let son leave off also. Furthermore I swear 
<A NAME="294"></A>never again will I do anything to save the Trojans from destruction, not 
<A NAME="295"></A>even when all Troy is burning in the flames which the Achaeans will 
<A NAME="296"></A>kindle."
<A NAME="297"></A><BR><BR>As soon as Juno heard this she said to her son Vulcan, "Son Vulcan, 
<A NAME="298"></A>hold now your flames; we ought not to use such violence against a god for 
<A NAME="299"></A>the sake of mortals."
<A NAME="300"></A><BR><BR>When she had thus spoken Vulcan quenched his flames, and the river 
<A NAME="301"></A>went back once more into his own fair bed.
<A NAME="302"></A><BR><BR>Xanthus was now beaten, so these two left off fighting, for Juno 
<A NAME="303"></A>stayed them though she was still angry; but a furious quarrel broke out 
<A NAME="304"></A>among the other gods, for they were of divided counsels. They fell on one 
<A NAME="305"></A>another with a mighty uproar- earth groaned, and the spacious firmament 
<A NAME="306"></A>rang out as with a blare of trumpets. Jove heard as he was sitting on Olympus, 
<A NAME="307"></A>and laughed for joy when he saw the gods coming to blows among themselves. 
<A NAME="308"></A>They were not long about beginning, and Mars piercer of shields opened 
<A NAME="309"></A>the battle. Sword in hand he sprang at once upon Minerva and reviled her. 
<A NAME="310"></A>"Why, vixen," said he, "have you again set the gods by the ears in the 
<A NAME="311"></A>pride and haughtiness of your heart? Have you forgotten how you set Diomed 
<A NAME="312"></A>son of Tydeus on to wound me, and yourself took visible spear and drove 
<A NAME="313"></A>it into me to the hurt of my fair body? You shall now suffer for what you 
<A NAME="314"></A>then did to me."
<A NAME="315"></A><BR><BR>As he spoke he struck her on the terrible tasselled aegis- so terrible 
<A NAME="316"></A>that not even can Jove's lightning pierce it. Here did murderous Mars strike 
<A NAME="317"></A>her with his great spear. She drew back and with her strong hand seized 
<A NAME="318"></A>a stone that was lying on the plain- great and rugged and black- which 
<A NAME="319"></A>men of old had set for the boundary of a field. With this she struck Mars 
<A NAME="320"></A>on the neck, and brought him down. Nine roods did he cover in his fall, 
<A NAME="321"></A>and his hair was all soiled in the dust, while his armour rang rattling 
<A NAME="322"></A>round him. But Minerva laughed and vaunted over him saying, "Idiot, have 
<A NAME="323"></A>you not learned how far stronger I am than you, but you must still match 
<A NAME="324"></A>yourself against me? Thus do your mother's curses now roost upon you, for 
<A NAME="325"></A>she is angry and would do you mischief because you have deserted the Achaeans 
<A NAME="326"></A>and are helping the Trojans."
<A NAME="327"></A><BR><BR>She then turned her two piercing eyes elsewhere, whereon Jove's 
<A NAME="328"></A>daughter Venus took Mars by the hand and led him away groaning all the 
<A NAME="329"></A>time, for it was only with great difficulty that he had come to himself 
<A NAME="330"></A>again. When Queen Juno saw her, she said to Minerva, "Look, daughter of 
<A NAME="331"></A>aegis-bearing Jove, unweariable, that vixen Venus is again taking Mars 
<A NAME="332"></A>through the crowd out of the battle; go after her at 
<A NAME="333"></A>once."
<A NAME="334"></A><BR><BR>Thus she spoke. Minerva sped after Venus with a will, and made 
<A NAME="335"></A>at her, striking her on the bosom with her strong hand so that she fell 
<A NAME="336"></A>fainting to the ground, and there they both lay stretched at full length. 
<A NAME="337"></A>Then Minerva vaunted over her saying, "May all who help the Trojans against 
<A NAME="338"></A>the Argives prove just as redoubtable and stalwart as Venus did when she 
<A NAME="339"></A>came across me while she was helping Mars. Had this been so, we should 
<A NAME="340"></A>long since have ended the war by sacking the strong city of 
<A NAME="341"></A>Ilius."
<A NAME="342"></A><BR><BR>Juno smiled as she listened. Meanwhile King Neptune turned to Apollo 
<A NAME="343"></A>saying, "Phoebus, why should we keep each other at arm's length? it is 
<A NAME="344"></A>not well, now that the others have begun fighting; it will be disgraceful 
<A NAME="345"></A>to us if we return to Jove's bronze-floored mansion on Olympus without 
<A NAME="346"></A>having fought each other; therefore come on, you are the younger of the 
<A NAME="347"></A>two, and I ought not to attack you, for I am older and have had more experience. 
<A NAME="348"></A>Idiot, you have no sense, and forget how we two alone of all the gods fared 
<A NAME="349"></A>hardly round about Ilius when we came from Jove's house and worked for 
<A NAME="350"></A>Laomedon a whole year at a stated wage and he gave us his orders. I built 
<A NAME="351"></A>the Trojans the wall about their city, so wide and fair that it might be 
<A NAME="352"></A>impregnable, while you, Phoebus, herded cattle for him in the dales of 
<A NAME="353"></A>many valleyed Ida. When, however, the glad hours brought round the time 
<A NAME="354"></A>of payment, mighty Laomedon robbed us of all our hire and sent us off with 
<A NAME="355"></A>nothing but abuse. He threatened to bind us hand and foot and sell us over 
<A NAME="356"></A>into some distant island. He tried, moreover, to cut off the ears of both 
<A NAME="357"></A>of us, so we went away in a rage, furious about the payment he had promised 
<A NAME="358"></A>us, and yet withheld; in spite of all this, you are now showing favour 
<A NAME="359"></A>to his people, and will not join us in compassing the utter ruin of the 
<A NAME="360"></A>proud Trojans with their wives and children."
<A NAME="361"></A><BR><BR>And King Apollo answered, "Lord of the earthquake, you would have 
<A NAME="362"></A>no respect for me if I were to fight you about a pack of miserable mortals, 
<A NAME="363"></A>who come out like leaves in summer and eat the fruit of the field, and 
<A NAME="364"></A>presently fall lifeless to the ground. Let us stay this fighting at once 
<A NAME="365"></A>and let them settle it among themselves."
<A NAME="366"></A><BR><BR>He turned away as he spoke, for he would lay no hand on the brother 
<A NAME="367"></A>of his own father. But his sister the huntress Diana, patroness of wild 
<A NAME="368"></A>beasts, was very angry with him and said, "So you would fly, Far-Darter, 
<A NAME="369"></A>and hand victory over to Neptune with a cheap vaunt to boot. Baby, why 
<A NAME="370"></A>keep your bow thus idle? Never let me again hear you bragging in my father's 
<A NAME="371"></A>house, as you have often done in the presence of the immortals, that you 
<A NAME="372"></A>would stand up and fight with Neptune."
<A NAME="373"></A><BR><BR>Apollo made her no answer, but Jove's august queen was angry and 
<A NAME="374"></A>upbraided her bitterly. "Bold vixen," she cried, "how dare you cross me 
<A NAME="375"></A>thus? For all your bow you will find it hard to hold your own against me. 
<A NAME="376"></A>Jove made you as a lion among women, and lets you kill them whenever you 
<A NAME="377"></A>choose. You will And it better to chase wild beasts and deer upon the mountains 
<A NAME="378"></A>than to fight those who are stronger than you are. If you would try war, 
<A NAME="379"></A>do so, and find out by pitting yourself against me, how far stronger I 
<A NAME="380"></A>am than you are."
<A NAME="381"></A><BR><BR>She caught both Diana's wrists with her left hand as she spoke, 
<A NAME="382"></A>and with her right she took the bow from her shoulders, and laughed as 
<A NAME="383"></A>she beat her with it about the ears while Diana wriggled and writhed under 
<A NAME="384"></A>her blows. Her swift arrows were shed upon the ground, and she fled weeping 
<A NAME="385"></A>from under Juno's hand as a dove that flies before a falcon to the cleft 
<A NAME="386"></A>of some hollow rock, when it is her good fortune to escape. Even so did 
<A NAME="387"></A>she fly weeping away, leaving her bow and arrows behind 
<A NAME="388"></A>her.
<A NAME="389"></A><BR><BR>Then the slayer of Argus, guide and guardian, said to Leto, "Leto, 
<A NAME="390"></A>I shall not fight you; it is ill to come to blows with any of Jove's wives. 
<A NAME="391"></A>Therefore boast as you will among the immortals that you worsted me in 
<A NAME="392"></A>fair fight."
<A NAME="393"></A><BR><BR>Leto then gathered up Diana's bow and arrows that had fallen about 
<A NAME="394"></A>amid the whirling dust, and when she had got them she made all haste after 
<A NAME="395"></A>her daughter. Diana had now reached Jove's bronze-floored mansion on Olympus, 
<A NAME="396"></A>and sat herself down with many tears on the knees of her father, while 
<A NAME="397"></A>her ambrosial raiment was quivering all about her. The son of Saturn drew 
<A NAME="398"></A>her towards him, and laughing pleasantly the while began to question her 
<A NAME="399"></A>saying, "Which of the heavenly beings, my dear child, has been treating 
<A NAME="400"></A>you in this cruel manner, as though you had been misconducting yourself 
<A NAME="401"></A>in the face of everybody?" and the fair-crowned goddess of the chase answered, 
<A NAME="402"></A>"It was your wife Juno, father, who has been beating me; it is always her 
<A NAME="403"></A>doing when there is any quarrelling among the immortals."
<A NAME="404"></A><BR><BR>Thus did they converse, and meanwhile Phoebus Apollo entered the 
<A NAME="405"></A>strong city of Ilius, for he was uneasy lest the wall should not hold out 
<A NAME="406"></A>and the Danaans should take the city then and there, before its hour had 
<A NAME="407"></A>come; but the rest of the ever-living gods went back, some angry and some 
<A NAME="408"></A>triumphant to Olympus, where they took their seats beside Jove lord of 
<A NAME="409"></A>the storm cloud, while Achilles still kept on dealing out death alike on 
<A NAME="410"></A>the Trojans and on their As when the smoke from some burning city ascends 
<A NAME="411"></A>to heaven when the anger of the gods has kindled it- there is then toil 
<A NAME="412"></A>for all, and sorrow for not a few- even so did Achilles bring toil and 
<A NAME="413"></A>sorrow on the Trojans.
<A NAME="414"></A><BR><BR>Old King Priam stood on a high tower of the wall looking down on 
<A NAME="415"></A>huge Achilles as the Trojans fled panic-stricken before him, and there 
<A NAME="416"></A>was none to help them. Presently he came down from off the tower and with 
<A NAME="417"></A>many a groan went along the wall to give orders to the brave warders of 
<A NAME="418"></A>the gate. "Keep the gates," said he, "wide open till the people come flying 
<A NAME="419"></A>into the city, for Achilles is hard by and is driving them in rout before 
<A NAME="420"></A>him. I see we are in great peril. As soon as our people are inside and 
<A NAME="421"></A>in safety, close the strong gates for I fear lest that terrible man should 
<A NAME="422"></A>come bounding inside along with the others."
<A NAME="423"></A><BR><BR>As he spoke they drew back the bolts and opened the gates, and 
<A NAME="424"></A>when these were opened there was a haven of refuge for the Trojans. Apollo 
<A NAME="425"></A>then came full speed out of the city to meet them and protect them. Right 
<A NAME="426"></A>for the city and the high wall, parched with thirst and grimy with dust, 
<A NAME="427"></A>still they fied on, with Achilles wielding his spear furiously behind them. 
<A NAME="428"></A>For he was as one possessed, and was thirsting after 
<A NAME="429"></A>glory.
<A NAME="430"></A><BR><BR>Then had the sons of the Achaeans taken the lofty gates of Troy 
<A NAME="431"></A>if Apollo had not spurred on Agenor, valiant and noble son to Antenor. 
<A NAME="432"></A>He put courage into his heart, and stood by his side to guard him, leaning 
<A NAME="433"></A>against a beech tree and shrouded in thick darkness. When Agenor saw Achilles 
<A NAME="434"></A>he stood still and his heart was clouded with care. "Alas," said he to 
<A NAME="435"></A>himself in his dismay, "if I fly before mighty Achilles, and go where all 
<A NAME="436"></A>the others are being driven in rout, he will none the less catch me and 
<A NAME="437"></A>kill me for a coward. How would it be were I to let Achilles drive the 
<A NAME="438"></A>others before him, and then fly from the wall to the plain that is behind 
<A NAME="439"></A>Ilius till I reach the spurs of Ida and can hide in the underwood that 
<A NAME="440"></A>is thereon? I could then wash the sweat from off me in the river and in 
<A NAME="441"></A>the evening return to Ilius. But why commune with myself in this way? Like 
<A NAME="442"></A>enough he would see me as I am hurrying from the city over the plain, and 
<A NAME="443"></A>would speed after me till he had caught me- I should stand no chance against 
<A NAME="444"></A>him, for he is mightiest of all mankind. What, then, if I go out and meet 
<A NAME="445"></A>him in front of the city? His flesh too, I take it, can be pierced by pointed 
<A NAME="446"></A>bronze. Life is the same in one and all, and men say that he is but mortal 
<A NAME="447"></A>despite the triumph that Jove son of Saturn vouchsafes 
<A NAME="448"></A>him."
<A NAME="449"></A><BR><BR>So saying he stood on his guard and awaited Achilles, for he was 
<A NAME="450"></A>now fain to fight him. As a leopardess that bounds from out a thick covert 
<A NAME="451"></A>to attack a hunter- she knows no fear and is not dismayed by the baying 
<A NAME="452"></A>of the hounds; even though the man be too quick for her and wound her either 
<A NAME="453"></A>with thrust or spear, still, though the spear has pierced her she will 
<A NAME="454"></A>not give in till she has either caught him in her grip or been killed outright- 
<A NAME="455"></A>even so did noble Agenor son of Antenor refuse to fly till he had made 
<A NAME="456"></A>trial of Achilles, and took aim at him with his spear, holding his round 
<A NAME="457"></A>shield before him and crying with a loud voice. "Of a truth," said he, 
<A NAME="458"></A>"noble Achilles, you deem that you shall this day sack the city of the 
<A NAME="459"></A>proud Trojans. Fool, there will be trouble enough yet before it, for there 
<A NAME="460"></A>is many a brave man of us still inside who will stand in front of our dear 
<A NAME="461"></A>parents with our wives and children, to defend Ilius. Here therefore, huge 
<A NAME="462"></A>and mighty warrior though you be, here shall you cue.
<A NAME="463"></A><BR><BR>As he spoke his strong hand hurled his javelin from him, and the 
<A NAME="464"></A>spear struck Achilles on the leg beneath the knee; the greave of newly 
<A NAME="465"></A>wrought tin rang loudly, but the spear recoiled from the body of him whom 
<A NAME="466"></A>it had struck, and did not pierce it, for the gods gift stayed it. Achilles 
<A NAME="467"></A>in his turn attacked noble Agenor, but Apollo would not vouchsafe him glory, 
<A NAME="468"></A>for he snatched Agenor away and hid him in a thick mist, sending him out 
<A NAME="469"></A>of the battle unmolested Then he craftily drew the son of Peleus away from 
<A NAME="470"></A>going after the host, for he put on the semblance of Agenor and stood in 
<A NAME="471"></A>front of Achilles, who ran towards him to give him chase and pursued him 
<A NAME="472"></A>over the corn lands of the plain, turning him towards the deep waters of 
<A NAME="473"></A>the river Scamander. Apollo ran but a little way before him and beguiled 
<A NAME="474"></A>Achilles by making him think all the time that he was on the point of overtaking 
<A NAME="475"></A>him. Meanwhile the rabble of routed Trojans was thankful to crowd within 
<A NAME="476"></A>the city till their numbers thronged it; no longer did they dare wait for 
<A NAME="477"></A>one another outside the city walls, to learn who had escaped and who were 
<A NAME="478"></A>fallen in fight, but all whose feet and knees could still carry them poured 
<A NAME="479"></A>pell-mell into the town.
