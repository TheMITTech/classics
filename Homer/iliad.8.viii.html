<A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A>Now when Morning, clad in her robe of saffron, had begun to suffuse light 
<A NAME="11"></A>over the earth, Jove called the gods in council on the topmost crest of 
<A NAME="12"></A>serrated Olympus. Then he spoke and all the other gods gave ear. "Hear 
<A NAME="13"></A>me," said he, "gods and goddesses, that I may speak even as I am minded. 
<A NAME="14"></A>Let none of you neither goddess nor god try to cross me, but obey me every 
<A NAME="15"></A>one of you that I may bring this matter to an end. If I see anyone acting 
<A NAME="16"></A>apart and helping either Trojans or Danaans, he shall be beaten inordinately 
<A NAME="17"></A>ere he come back again to Olympus; or I will hurl him down into dark Tartarus 
<A NAME="18"></A>far into the deepest pit under the earth, where the gates are iron and 
<A NAME="19"></A>the floor bronze, as far beneath Hades as heaven is high above the earth, 
<A NAME="20"></A>that you may learn how much the mightiest I am among you. Try me and find 
<A NAME="21"></A>out for yourselves. Hangs me a golden chain from heaven, and lay hold of 
<A NAME="22"></A>it all of you, gods and goddesses together- tug as you will, you will not 
<A NAME="23"></A>drag Jove the supreme counsellor from heaven to earth; but were I to pull 
<A NAME="24"></A>at it myself I should draw you up with earth and sea into the bargain, 
<A NAME="25"></A>then would I bind the chain about some pinnacle of Olympus and leave you 
<A NAME="26"></A>all dangling in the mid firmament. So far am I above all others either 
<A NAME="27"></A>of gods or men."
<A NAME="28"></A><BR><BR>They were frightened and all of them of held their peace, for he 
<A NAME="29"></A>had spoken masterfully; but at last Minerva answered, "Father, son of Saturn, 
<A NAME="30"></A>king of kings, we all know that your might is not to be gainsaid, but we 
<A NAME="31"></A>are also sorry for the Danaan warriors, who are perishing and coming to 
<A NAME="32"></A>a bad end. We will, however, since you so bid us, refrain from actual fighting, 
<A NAME="33"></A>but we will make serviceable suggestions to the Argives that they may not 
<A NAME="34"></A>all of them perish in your displeasure."
<A NAME="35"></A><BR><BR>Jove smiled at her and answered, "Take heart, my child, Trito-born; 
<A NAME="36"></A>I am not really in earnest, and I wish to be kind to 
<A NAME="37"></A>you."
<A NAME="38"></A><BR><BR>With this he yoked his fleet horses, with hoofs of bronze and manes 
<A NAME="39"></A>of glittering gold. He girded himself also with gold about the body, seized 
<A NAME="40"></A>his gold whip and took his seat in his chariot. Thereon he lashed his horses 
<A NAME="41"></A>and they flew forward nothing loth midway twixt earth and starry heaven. 
<A NAME="42"></A>After a while he reached many-fountained Ida, mother of wild beasts, and 
<A NAME="43"></A>Gargarus, where are his grove and fragrant altar. There the father of gods 
<A NAME="44"></A>and men stayed his horses, took them from the chariot, and hid them in 
<A NAME="45"></A>a thick cloud; then he took his seat all glorious upon the topmost crests, 
<A NAME="46"></A>looking down upon the city of Troy and the ships of the 
<A NAME="47"></A>Achaeans.
<A NAME="48"></A><BR><BR>The Achaeans took their morning meal hastily at the ships, and 
<A NAME="49"></A>afterwards put on their armour. The Trojans on the other hand likewise 
<A NAME="50"></A>armed themselves throughout the city, fewer in numbers but nevertheless 
<A NAME="51"></A>eager perforce to do battle for their wives and children. All the gates 
<A NAME="52"></A>were flung wide open, and horse and foot sallied forth with the tramp as 
<A NAME="53"></A>of a great multitude.
<A NAME="54"></A><BR><BR>When they were got together in one place, shield clashed with shield, 
<A NAME="55"></A>and spear with spear, in the conflict of mail-clad men. Mighty was the 
<A NAME="56"></A>din as the bossed shields pressed hard on one another- death- cry and shout 
<A NAME="57"></A>of triumph of slain and slayers, and the earth ran red with 
<A NAME="58"></A>blood.
<A NAME="59"></A><BR><BR>Now so long as the day waxed and it was still morning their weapons 
<A NAME="60"></A>beat against one another, and the people fell, but when the sun had reached 
<A NAME="61"></A>mid-heaven, the sire of all balanced his golden scales, and put two fates 
<A NAME="62"></A>of death within them, one for the Trojans and the other for the Achaeans. 
<A NAME="63"></A>He took the balance by the middle, and when he lifted it up the day of 
<A NAME="64"></A>the Achaeans sank; the death-fraught scale of the Achaeans settled down 
<A NAME="65"></A>upon the ground, while that of the Trojans rose heavenwards. Then he thundered 
<A NAME="66"></A>aloud from Ida, and sent the glare of his lightning upon the Achaeans; 
<A NAME="67"></A>when they saw this, pale fear fell upon them and they were sore 
<A NAME="68"></A>afraid.
<A NAME="69"></A><BR><BR>Idomeneus dared not stay nor yet Agamemnon, nor did the two Ajaxes, 
<A NAME="70"></A>servants of Mars, hold their ground. Nestor knight of Gerene alone stood 
<A NAME="71"></A>firm, bulwark of the Achaeans, not of his own will, but one of his horses 
<A NAME="72"></A>was disabled. Alexandrus husband of lovely Helen had hit it with an arrow 
<A NAME="73"></A>just on the top of its head where the mane begins to grow away from the 
<A NAME="74"></A>skull, a very deadly place. The horse bounded in his anguish as the arrow 
<A NAME="75"></A>pierced his brain, and his struggles threw others into confusion. The old 
<A NAME="76"></A>man instantly began cutting the traces with his sword, but Hector's fleet 
<A NAME="77"></A>horses bore down upon him through the rout with their bold charioteer, 
<A NAME="78"></A>even Hector himself, and the old man would have perished there and then 
<A NAME="79"></A>had not Diomed been quick to mark, and with a loud cry called Ulysses to 
<A NAME="80"></A>help him.
<A NAME="81"></A><BR><BR>"Ulysses," he cried, "noble son of Laertes where are you flying 
<A NAME="82"></A>to, with your back turned like a coward? See that you are not struck with 
<A NAME="83"></A>a spear between the shoulders. Stay here and help me to defend Nestor from 
<A NAME="84"></A>this man's furious onset."
<A NAME="85"></A><BR><BR>Ulysses would not give ear, but sped onward to the ships of the 
<A NAME="86"></A>Achaeans, and the son of Tydeus flinging himself alone into the thick of 
<A NAME="87"></A>the fight took his stand before the horses of the son of Neleus. "Sir," 
<A NAME="88"></A>said he, "these young warriors are pressing you hard, your force is spent, 
<A NAME="89"></A>and age is heavy upon you, your squire is naught, and your horses are slow 
<A NAME="90"></A>to move. Mount my chariot and see what the horses of Tros can do- how cleverly 
<A NAME="91"></A>they can scud hither and thither over the plain either in flight or in 
<A NAME="92"></A>pursuit. I took them from the hero Aeneas. Let our squires attend to your 
<A NAME="93"></A>own steeds, but let us drive mine straight at the Trojans, that Hector 
<A NAME="94"></A>may learn how furiously I too can wield my spear."
<A NAME="95"></A><BR><BR>Nestor knight of Gerene hearkened to his words. Thereon the doughty 
<A NAME="96"></A>squires, Sthenelus and kind-hearted Eurymedon, saw to Nestor's horses, 
<A NAME="97"></A>while the two both mounted Diomed's chariot. Nestor took the reins in his 
<A NAME="98"></A>hands and lashed the horses on; they were soon close up with Hector, and 
<A NAME="99"></A>the son of Tydeus aimed a spear at him as he was charging full speed towards 
<A NAME="100"></A>them. He missed him, but struck his charioteer and squire Eniopeus son 
<A NAME="101"></A>of noble Thebaeus in the breast by the nipple while the reins were in his 
<A NAME="102"></A>hands, so that he died there and then, and the horses swerved as he fell 
<A NAME="103"></A>headlong from the chariot. Hector was greatly grieved at the loss of his 
<A NAME="104"></A>charioteer, but let him lie for all his sorrow, while he went in quest 
<A NAME="105"></A>of another driver; nor did his steeds have to go long without one, for 
<A NAME="106"></A>he presently found brave Archeptolemus the son of Iphitus, and made him 
<A NAME="107"></A>get up behind the horses, giving the reins into his 
<A NAME="108"></A>hand.
<A NAME="109"></A><BR><BR>All had then been lost and no help for it, for they would have 
<A NAME="110"></A>been penned up in Ilius like sheep, had not the sire of gods and men been 
<A NAME="111"></A>quick to mark, and hurled a fiery flaming thunderbolt which fell just in 
<A NAME="112"></A>front of Diomed's horses with a flare of burning brimstone. The horses 
<A NAME="113"></A>were frightened and tried to back beneath the car, while the reins dropped 
<A NAME="114"></A>from Nestor's hands. Then he was afraid and said to Diomed, "Son of Tydeus, 
<A NAME="115"></A>turn your horses in flight; see you not that the hand of Jove is against 
<A NAME="116"></A>you? To-day he vouchsafes victory to Hector; to-morrow, if it so please 
<A NAME="117"></A>him, he will again grant it to ourselves; no man, however brave, may thwart 
<A NAME="118"></A>the purpose of Jove, for he is far stronger than any."
<A NAME="119"></A><BR><BR>Diomed answered, "All that you have said is true; there is a grief 
<A NAME="120"></A>however which pierces me to the very heart, for Hector will talk among 
<A NAME="121"></A>the Trojans and say, 'The son of Tydeus fled before me to the ships.' This 
<A NAME="122"></A>is the vaunt he will make, and may earth then swallow 
<A NAME="123"></A>me."
<A NAME="124"></A><BR><BR>"Son of Tydeus," replied Nestor, "what mean you? Though Hector 
<A NAME="125"></A>say that you are a coward the Trojans and Dardanians will not believe him, 
<A NAME="126"></A>nor yet the wives of the mighty warriors whom you have laid 
<A NAME="127"></A>low."
<A NAME="128"></A><BR><BR>So saying he turned the horses back through the thick of the battle, 
<A NAME="129"></A>and with a cry that rent the air the Trojans and Hector rained their darts 
<A NAME="130"></A>after them. Hector shouted to him and said, "Son of Tydeus, the Danaans 
<A NAME="131"></A>have done you honour hitherto as regards your place at table, the meals 
<A NAME="132"></A>they give you, and the filling of your cup with wine. Henceforth they will 
<A NAME="133"></A>despise you, for you are become no better than a woman. Be off, girl and 
<A NAME="134"></A>coward that you are, you shall not scale our walls through any Hinching 
<A NAME="135"></A>upon my part; neither shall you carry off our wives in your ships, for 
<A NAME="136"></A>I shall kill you with my own hand."
<A NAME="137"></A><BR><BR>The son of Tydeus was in two minds whether or no to turn his horses 
<A NAME="138"></A>round again and fight him. Thrice did he doubt, and thrice did Jove thunder 
<A NAME="139"></A>from the heights of. Ida in token to the Trojans that he would turn the 
<A NAME="140"></A>battle in their favour. Hector then shouted to them and said, "Trojans, 
<A NAME="141"></A>Lycians, and Dardanians, lovers of close fighting, be men, my friends, 
<A NAME="142"></A>and fight with might and with main; I see that Jove is minded to vouchsafe 
<A NAME="143"></A>victory and great glory to myself, while he will deal destruction upon 
<A NAME="144"></A>the Danaans. Fools, for having thought of building this weak and worthless 
<A NAME="145"></A>wall. It shall not stay my fury; my horses will spring lightly over their 
<A NAME="146"></A>trench, and when I am at their ships forget not to bring me fire that I 
<A NAME="147"></A>may burn them, while I slaughter the Argives who will be all dazed and 
<A NAME="148"></A>bewildered by the smoke."
<A NAME="149"></A><BR><BR>Then he cried to his horses, "Xanthus and Podargus, and you Aethon 
<A NAME="150"></A>and goodly Lampus, pay me for your keep now and for all the honey-sweet 
<A NAME="151"></A>corn with which Andromache daughter of great Eetion has fed you, and for 
<A NAME="152"></A>she has mixed wine and water for you to drink whenever you would, before 
<A NAME="153"></A>doing so even for me who am her own husband. Haste in pursuit, that we 
<A NAME="154"></A>may take the shield of Nestor, the fame of which ascends to heaven, for 
<A NAME="155"></A>it is of solid gold, arm-rods and all, and that we may strip from the shoulders 
<A NAME="156"></A>of Diomed. the cuirass which Vulcan made him. Could we take these two things, 
<A NAME="157"></A>the Achaeans would set sail in their ships this self-same 
<A NAME="158"></A>night."
<A NAME="159"></A><BR><BR>Thus did he vaunt, but Queen Juno made high Olympus quake as she 
<A NAME="160"></A>shook with rage upon her throne. Then said she to the mighty god of Neptune, 
<A NAME="161"></A>"What now, wide ruling lord of the earthquake? Can you find no compassion 
<A NAME="162"></A>in your heart for the dying Danaans, who bring you many a welcome offering 
<A NAME="163"></A>to Helice and to Aegae? Wish them well then. If all of us who are with 
<A NAME="164"></A>the Danaans were to drive the Trojans back and keep Jove from helping them, 
<A NAME="165"></A>he would have to sit there sulking alone on Ida."
<A NAME="166"></A><BR><BR>King Neptune was greatly troubled and answered, "Juno, rash of 
<A NAME="167"></A>tongue, what are you talking about? We other gods must not set ourselves 
<A NAME="168"></A>against Jove, for he is far stronger than we are."
<A NAME="169"></A><BR><BR>Thus did they converse; but the whole space enclosed by the ditch, 
<A NAME="170"></A>from the ships even to the wall, was filled with horses and warriors, who 
<A NAME="171"></A>were pent up there by Hector son of Priam, now that the hand of Jove was 
<A NAME="172"></A>with him. He would even have set fire to the ships and burned them, had 
<A NAME="173"></A>not Queen Juno put it into the mind of Agamemnon, to bestir himself and 
<A NAME="174"></A>to encourage the Achaeans. To this end he went round the ships and tents 
<A NAME="175"></A>carrying a great purple cloak, and took his stand by the huge black hull 
<A NAME="176"></A>of Ulysses' ship, which was middlemost of all; it was from this place that 
<A NAME="177"></A>his voice would carry farthest, on the one hand towards the tents of Ajax 
<A NAME="178"></A>son of Telamon, and on the other towards those of Achilles- for these two 
<A NAME="179"></A>heroes, well assured of their own strength, had valorously drawn up their 
<A NAME="180"></A>ships at the two ends of the line. From this spot then, with a voice that 
<A NAME="181"></A>could be heard afar, he shouted to the Danaans, saying, "Argives, shame 
<A NAME="182"></A>on you cowardly creatures, brave in semblance only; where are now our vaunts 
<A NAME="183"></A>that we should prove victorious- the vaunts we made so vaingloriously in 
<A NAME="184"></A>Lemnos, when we ate the flesh of horned cattle and filled our mixing-bowls 
<A NAME="185"></A>to the brim? You vowed that you would each of you stand against a hundred 
<A NAME="186"></A>or two hundred men, and now you prove no match even for one- for Hector, 
<A NAME="187"></A>who will be ere long setting our ships in a blaze. Father Jove, did you 
<A NAME="188"></A>ever so ruin a great king and rob him so utterly of his greatness? yet, 
<A NAME="189"></A>when to my sorrow I was coming hither, I never let my ship pass your altars 
<A NAME="190"></A>without offering the fat and thigh-bones of heifers upon every one of them, 
<A NAME="191"></A>so eager was I to sack the city of Troy. Vouchsafe me then this prayer- 
<A NAME="192"></A>suffer us to escape at any rate with our lives, and let not the Achaeans 
<A NAME="193"></A>be so utterly vanquished by the Trojans."
<A NAME="194"></A><BR><BR>Thus did he pray, and father Jove pitying his tears vouchsafed 
<A NAME="195"></A>him that his people should live, not die; forthwith he sent them an eagle, 
<A NAME="196"></A>most unfailingly portentous of all birds, with a young fawn in its talons; 
<A NAME="197"></A>the eagle dropped the fawn by the altar on which the Achaeans sacrificed 
<A NAME="198"></A>to Jove the lord of omens; When, therefore, the people saw that the bird 
<A NAME="199"></A>had come from Jove, they sprang more fiercely upon the Trojans and fought 
<A NAME="200"></A>more boldly.
<A NAME="201"></A><BR><BR>There was no man of all the many Danaans who could then boast that 
<A NAME="202"></A>he had driven his horses over the trench and gone forth to fight sooner 
<A NAME="203"></A>than the son of Tydeus; long before any one else could do so he slew an 
<A NAME="204"></A>armed warrior of the Trojans, Agelaus the son of Phradmon. He had turned 
<A NAME="205"></A>his horses in flight, but the spear struck him in the back midway between 
<A NAME="206"></A>his shoulders and went right through his chest, and his armour rang rattling 
<A NAME="207"></A>round him as he fell forward from his chariot.
<A NAME="208"></A><BR><BR>After him came Agamemnon and Menelaus, sons of Atreus, the two 
<A NAME="209"></A>Ajaxes clothed in valour as with a garment, Idomeneus and his companion 
<A NAME="210"></A>in arms Meriones, peer of murderous Mars, and Eurypylus the brave son of 
<A NAME="211"></A>Euaemon. Ninth came Teucer with his bow, and took his place under cover 
<A NAME="212"></A>of the shield of Ajax son of Telamon. When Ajax lifted his shield Teucer 
<A NAME="213"></A>would peer round, and when he had hit any one in the throng, the man would 
<A NAME="214"></A>fall dead; then Teucer would hie back to Ajax as a child to its mother, 
<A NAME="215"></A>and again duck down under his shield.
<A NAME="216"></A><BR><BR>Which of the Trojans did brave Teucer first kill? Orsilochus, and 
<A NAME="217"></A>then Ormenus and Ophelestes, Daetor, Chromius, and godlike Lycophontes, 
<A NAME="218"></A>Amopaon son of Polyaemon, and Melanippus. these in turn did he lay low 
<A NAME="219"></A>upon the earth, and King Agamemnon was glad when he saw him making havoc 
<A NAME="220"></A>of the Trojans with his mighty bow. He went up to him and said, "Teucer, 
<A NAME="221"></A>man after my own heart, son of Telamon, captain among the host, shoot on, 
<A NAME="222"></A>and be at once the saving of the Danaans and the glory of your father Telamon, 
<A NAME="223"></A>who brought you up and took care of you in his own house when you were 
<A NAME="224"></A>a child, bastard though you were. Cover him with glory though he is far 
<A NAME="225"></A>off; I will promise and I will assuredly perform; if aegis-bearing Jove 
<A NAME="226"></A>and Minerva grant me to sack the city of Ilius, you shall have the next 
<A NAME="227"></A>best meed of honour after my own- a tripod, or two horses with their chariot, 
<A NAME="228"></A>or a woman who shall go up into your bed."
<A NAME="229"></A><BR><BR>And Teucer answered, "Most noble son of Atreus, you need not urge 
<A NAME="230"></A>me; from the moment we began to drive them back to Ilius, I have never 
<A NAME="231"></A>ceased so far as in me lies to look out for men whom I can shoot and kill; 
<A NAME="232"></A>I have shot eight barbed shafts, and all of them have been buried in the 
<A NAME="233"></A>flesh of warlike youths, but this mad dog I cannot hit."
<A NAME="234"></A><BR><BR>As he spoke he aimed another arrow straight at Hector, for he was 
<A NAME="235"></A>bent on hitting him; nevertheless he missed him, and the arrow hit Priam's 
<A NAME="236"></A>brave son Gorgythion in the breast. His mother, fair Castianeira, lovely 
<A NAME="237"></A>as a goddess, had been married from Aesyme, and now he bowed his head as 
<A NAME="238"></A>a garden poppy in full bloom when it is weighed down by showers in spring- 
<A NAME="239"></A>even thus heavy bowed his head beneath the weight of his 
<A NAME="240"></A>helmet.
<A NAME="241"></A><BR><BR>Again he aimed at Hector, for he was longing to hit him, and again 
<A NAME="242"></A>his arrow missed, for Apollo turned it aside; but he hit Hector's brave 
<A NAME="243"></A>charioteer Archeptolemus in the breast, by the nipple, as he was driving 
<A NAME="244"></A>furiously into the fight. The horses swerved aside as he fell headlong 
<A NAME="245"></A>from the chariot, and there was no life left in him. Hector was greatly 
<A NAME="246"></A>grieved at the loss of his charioteer, but for all his sorrow he let him 
<A NAME="247"></A>lie where he fell, and bade his brother Cebriones, who was hard by, take 
<A NAME="248"></A>the reins. Cebriones did as he had said. Hector thereon with a loud cry 
<A NAME="249"></A>sprang from his chariot to the ground, and seizing a great stone made straight 
<A NAME="250"></A>for Teucer with intent kill him. Teucer had just taken an arrow from his 
<A NAME="251"></A>quiver and had laid it upon the bow-string, but Hector struck him with 
<A NAME="252"></A>the jagged stone as he was taking aim and drawing the string to his shoulder; 
<A NAME="253"></A>he hit him just where the collar-bone divides the neck from the chest, 
<A NAME="254"></A>a very deadly place, and broke the sinew of his arm so that his wrist was 
<A NAME="255"></A>less, and the bow dropped from his hand as he fell forward on his knees. 
<A NAME="256"></A>Ajax saw that his brother had fallen, and running towards him bestrode 
<A NAME="257"></A>him and sheltered him with his shield. Meanwhile his two trusty squires, 
<A NAME="258"></A>Mecisteus son of Echius, and Alastor, came up and bore him to the ships 
<A NAME="259"></A>groaning in his great pain.
<A NAME="260"></A><BR><BR>Jove now again put heart into the Trojans, and they drove the Achaeans 
<A NAME="261"></A>to their deep trench with Hector in all his glory at their head. As a hound 
<A NAME="262"></A>grips a wild boar or lion in flank or buttock when he gives him chase, 
<A NAME="263"></A>and watches warily for his wheeling, even so did Hector follow close upon 
<A NAME="264"></A>the Achaeans, ever killing the hindmost as they rushed panic-stricken onwards. 
<A NAME="265"></A>When they had fled through the set stakes and trench and many Achaeans 
<A NAME="266"></A>had been laid low at the hands of the Trojans, they halted at their ships, 
<A NAME="267"></A>calling upon one another and praying every man instantly as they lifted 
<A NAME="268"></A>up their hands to the gods; but Hector wheeled his horses this way and 
<A NAME="269"></A>that, his eyes glaring like those of Gorgo or murderous 
<A NAME="270"></A>Mars.
<A NAME="271"></A><BR><BR>Juno when she saw them had pity upon them, and at once said to 
<A NAME="272"></A>Minerva, "Alas, child of aegis-bearing Jove, shall you and I take no more 
<A NAME="273"></A>thought for the dying Danaans, though it be the last time we ever do so? 
<A NAME="274"></A>See how they perish and come to a bad end before the onset of but a single 
<A NAME="275"></A>man. Hector the son of Priam rages with intolerable fury, and has already 
<A NAME="276"></A>done great mischief."
<A NAME="277"></A><BR><BR>Minerva answered, "Would, indeed, this fellow might die in his 
<A NAME="278"></A>own land, and fall by the hands of the Achaeans; but my father Jove is 
<A NAME="279"></A>mad with spleen, ever foiling me, ever headstrong and unjust. He forgets 
<A NAME="280"></A>how often I saved his son when he was worn out by the labours Eurystheus 
<A NAME="281"></A>had laid on him. He would weep till his cry came up to heaven, and then 
<A NAME="282"></A>Jove would send me down to help him; if I had had the sense to foresee 
<A NAME="283"></A>all this, when Eurystheus sent him to the house of Hades, to fetch the 
<A NAME="284"></A>hell-hound from Erebus, he would never have come back alive out of the 
<A NAME="285"></A>deep waters of the river Styx. And now Jove hates me, while he lets Thetis 
<A NAME="286"></A>have her way because she kissed his knees and took hold of his beard, when 
<A NAME="287"></A>she was begging him to do honour to Achilles. I shall know what to do next 
<A NAME="288"></A>time he begins calling me his grey-eyed darling. Get our horses ready, 
<A NAME="289"></A>while I go within the house of aegis-bearing Jove and put on my armour; 
<A NAME="290"></A>we shall then find out whether Priam's son Hector will be glad to meet 
<A NAME="291"></A>us in the highways of battle, or whether the Trojans will glut hounds and 
<A NAME="292"></A>vultures with the fat of their flesh as they he dead by the ships of the 
<A NAME="293"></A>Achaeans."
<A NAME="294"></A><BR><BR>Thus did she speak and white-armed Juno, daughter of great Saturn, 
<A NAME="295"></A>obeyed her words; she set about harnessing her gold-bedizened steeds, while 
<A NAME="296"></A>Minerva daughter of aegis-bearing Jove flung her richly vesture, made with 
<A NAME="297"></A>her own hands, on to the threshold of her father, and donned the shirt 
<A NAME="298"></A>of Jove, arming herself for battle. Then she stepped into her flaming chariot, 
<A NAME="299"></A>and grasped the spear so stout and sturdy and strong with which she quells 
<A NAME="300"></A>the ranks of heroes who have displeased her. Juno lashed her horses, and 
<A NAME="301"></A>the gates of heaven bellowed as they flew open of their own accord- gates 
<A NAME="302"></A>over which the Hours preside, in whose hands are heaven and Olympus, either 
<A NAME="303"></A>to open the dense cloud that hides them or to close it. Through these the 
<A NAME="304"></A>goddesses drove their obedient steeds.
<A NAME="305"></A><BR><BR>But father Jove when he saw them from Ida was very angry, and sent 
<A NAME="306"></A>winged Iris with a message to them. "Go," said he, "fleet Iris, turn them 
<A NAME="307"></A>back, and see that they do not come near me, for if we come to fighting 
<A NAME="308"></A>there will be mischief. This is what I say, and this is what I mean to 
<A NAME="309"></A>do. I will lame their horses for them; I will hurl them from their chariot, 
<A NAME="310"></A>and will break it in pieces. It will take them all ten years to heal the 
<A NAME="311"></A>wounds my lightning shall inflict upon them; my grey-eyed daughter will 
<A NAME="312"></A>then learn what quarrelling with her father means. I am less surprised 
<A NAME="313"></A>and angry with Juno, for whatever I say she always contradicts 
<A NAME="314"></A>me."
<A NAME="315"></A><BR><BR>With this Iris went her way, fleet as the wind, from the heights 
<A NAME="316"></A>of Ida to the lofty summits of Olympus. She met the goddesses at the outer 
<A NAME="317"></A>gates of its many valleys and gave them her message. "What," said she, 
<A NAME="318"></A>"are you about? Are you mad? The son of Saturn forbids going. This is what 
<A NAME="319"></A>he says, and this is he means to do, he will lame your horses for you, 
<A NAME="320"></A>he will hurl you from your chariot, and will break it in pieces. It will 
<A NAME="321"></A>take you all ten years to heal the wounds his lightning will inflict upon 
<A NAME="322"></A>you, that you may learn, grey-eyed goddess, what quarrelling with your 
<A NAME="323"></A>father means. He is less hurt and angry with Juno, for whatever he says 
<A NAME="324"></A>she always contradicts him but you, bold bold hussy, will you really dare 
<A NAME="325"></A>to raise your huge spear in defiance of Jove?"
<A NAME="326"></A><BR><BR>With this she left them, and Juno said to Minerva, "Of a truth, 
<A NAME="327"></A>child of aegis-bearing Jove, I am not for fighting men's battles further 
<A NAME="328"></A>in defiance of Jove. Let them live or die as luck will have it, and let 
<A NAME="329"></A>Jove mete out his judgements upon the Trojans and Danaans according to 
<A NAME="330"></A>his own pleasure."
<A NAME="331"></A><BR><BR>She turned her steeds; the Hours presently unyoked them, made them 
<A NAME="332"></A>fast to their ambrosial mangers, and leaned the chariot against the end 
<A NAME="333"></A>wall of the courtyard. The two goddesses then sat down upon their golden 
<A NAME="334"></A>thrones, amid the company of the other gods; but they were very 
<A NAME="335"></A>angry.
<A NAME="336"></A><BR><BR>Presently father Jove drove his chariot to Olympus, and entered 
<A NAME="337"></A>the assembly of gods. The mighty lord of the earthquake unyoked his horses 
<A NAME="338"></A>for him, set the car upon its stand, and threw a cloth over it. Jove then 
<A NAME="339"></A>sat down upon his golden throne and Olympus reeled beneath him. Minerva 
<A NAME="340"></A>and Juno sat alone, apart from Jove, and neither spoke nor asked him questions, 
<A NAME="341"></A>but Jove knew what they meant, and said, "Minerva and Juno, why are you 
<A NAME="342"></A>so angry? Are you fatigued with killing so many of your dear friends the 
<A NAME="343"></A>Trojans? Be this as it may, such is the might of my hands that all the 
<A NAME="344"></A>gods in Olympus cannot turn me; you were both of you trembling all over 
<A NAME="345"></A>ere ever you saw the fight and its terrible doings. I tell you therefore-and 
<A NAME="346"></A>it would have surely been- I should have struck you with lighting, and 
<A NAME="347"></A>your chariots would never have brought you back again to 
<A NAME="348"></A>Olympus."
<A NAME="349"></A><BR><BR>Minerva and Juno groaned in spirit as they sat side by side and 
<A NAME="350"></A>brooded mischief for the Trojans. Minerva sat silent without a word, for 
<A NAME="351"></A>she was in a furious passion and bitterly incensed against her father; 
<A NAME="352"></A>but Juno could not contain herself and said, "What, dread son of Saturn, 
<A NAME="353"></A>are you talking about? We know how great your power is, nevertheless we 
<A NAME="354"></A>have compassion upon the Danaan warriors who are perishing and coming to 
<A NAME="355"></A>a bad end. We will, however, since you so bid us, refrain from actual fighting, 
<A NAME="356"></A>but we will make serviceable suggestions to the Argives, that they may 
<A NAME="357"></A>not all of them perish in your displeasure."
<A NAME="358"></A><BR><BR>And Jove answered, "To-morrow morning, Juno, if you choose to do 
<A NAME="359"></A>so, you will see the son of Saturn destroying large numbers of the Argives, 
<A NAME="360"></A>for fierce Hector shall not cease fighting till he has roused the son of 
<A NAME="361"></A>Peleus when they are fighting in dire straits at their ships' sterns about 
<A NAME="362"></A>the body of Patroclus. Like it or no, this is how it is decreed; for aught 
<A NAME="363"></A>I care, you may go to the lowest depths beneath earth and sea, where Iapetus 
<A NAME="364"></A>and Saturn dwell in lone Tartarus with neither ray of light nor breath 
<A NAME="365"></A>of wind to cheer them. You may go on and on till you get there, and I shall 
<A NAME="366"></A>not care one whit for your displeasure; you are the greatest vixen 
<A NAME="367"></A>living."
<A NAME="368"></A><BR><BR>Juno made him no answer. The sun's glorious orb now sank into Oceanus 
<A NAME="369"></A>and drew down night over the land. Sorry indeed were the Trojans when light 
<A NAME="370"></A>failed them, but welcome and thrice prayed for did darkness fall upon the 
<A NAME="371"></A>Achaeans.
<A NAME="372"></A><BR><BR>Then Hector led the Trojans back from the ships, and held a council 
<A NAME="373"></A>on the open space near the river, where there was a spot ear corpses. They 
<A NAME="374"></A>left their chariots and sat down on the ground to hear the speech he made 
<A NAME="375"></A>them. He grasped a spear eleven cubits long, the bronze point of which 
<A NAME="376"></A>gleamed in front of it, while the ring round the spear-head was of gold 
<A NAME="377"></A>Spear in hand he spoke. "Hear me," said he, "Trojans, Dardanians, and allies. 
<A NAME="378"></A>I deemed but now that I should destroy the ships and all the Achaeans with 
<A NAME="379"></A>them ere I went back to Ilius, but darkness came on too soon. It was this 
<A NAME="380"></A>alone that saved them and their ships upon the seashore. Now, therefore, 
<A NAME="381"></A>let us obey the behests of night, and prepare our suppers. Take your horses 
<A NAME="382"></A>out of their chariots and give them their feeds of corn; then make speed 
<A NAME="383"></A>to bring sheep and cattle from the city; bring wine also and corn for your 
<A NAME="384"></A>horses and gather much wood, that from dark till dawn we may burn watchfires 
<A NAME="385"></A>whose flare may reach to heaven. For the Achaeans may try to fly beyond 
<A NAME="386"></A>the sea by night, and they must not embark scatheless and unmolested; many 
<A NAME="387"></A>a man among them must take a dart with him to nurse at home, hit with spear 
<A NAME="388"></A>or arrow as he is leaping on board his ship, that others may fear to bring 
<A NAME="389"></A>war and weeping upon the Trojans. Moreover let the heralds tell it about 
<A NAME="390"></A>the city that the growing youths and grey-bearded men are to camp upon 
<A NAME="391"></A>its heaven-built walls. Let the women each of them light a great fire in 
<A NAME="392"></A>her house, and let watch be safely kept lest the town be entered by surprise 
<A NAME="393"></A>while the host is outside. See to it, brave Trojans, as I have said, and 
<A NAME="394"></A>let this suffice for the moment; at daybreak I will instruct you further. 
<A NAME="395"></A>I pray in hope to Jove and to the gods that we may then drive those fate-sped 
<A NAME="396"></A>hounds from our land, for 'tis the fates that have borne them and their 
<A NAME="397"></A>ships hither. This night, therefore, let us keep watch, but with early 
<A NAME="398"></A>morning let us put on our armour and rouse fierce war at the ships of the 
<A NAME="399"></A>Achaeans; I shall then know whether brave Diomed the son of Tydeus will 
<A NAME="400"></A>drive me back from the ships to the wall, or whether I shall myself slay 
<A NAME="401"></A>him and carry off his bloodstained spoils. To-morrow let him show his mettle, 
<A NAME="402"></A>abide my spear if he dare. I ween that at break of day, he shall be among 
<A NAME="403"></A>the first to fall and many another of his comrades round him. Would that 
<A NAME="404"></A>I were as sure of being immortal and never growing old, and of being worshipped 
<A NAME="405"></A>like Minerva and Apollo, as I am that this day will bring evil to the 
<A NAME="406"></A>Argives."
<A NAME="407"></A><BR><BR>Thus spoke Hector and the Trojans shouted applause. They took their 
<A NAME="408"></A>sweating steeds from under the yoke, and made them fast each by his own 
<A NAME="409"></A>chariot. They made haste to bring sheep and cattle from the city, they 
<A NAME="410"></A>brought wine also and corn from their houses and gathered much wood. They 
<A NAME="411"></A>then offered unblemished hecatombs to the immortals, and the wind carried 
<A NAME="412"></A>the sweet savour of sacrifice to heaven- but the blessed gods partook not 
<A NAME="413"></A>thereof, for they bitterly hated Ilius with Priam and Priam's people. Thus 
<A NAME="414"></A>high in hope they sat through the livelong night by the highways of war, 
<A NAME="415"></A>and many a watchfire did they kindle. As when the stars shine clear, and 
<A NAME="416"></A>the moon is bright- there is not a breath of air, not a peak nor glade 
<A NAME="417"></A>nor jutting headland but it stands out in the ineffable radiance that breaks 
<A NAME="418"></A>from the serene of heaven; the stars can all of them be told and the heart 
<A NAME="419"></A>of the shepherd is glad- even thus shone the watchfires of the Trojans 
<A NAME="420"></A>before Ilius midway between the ships and the river Xanthus. A thousand 
<A NAME="421"></A>camp-fires gleamed upon the plain, and in the glow of each there sat fifty 
<A NAME="422"></A>men, while the horses, champing oats and corn beside their chariots, waited 
<A NAME="423"></A>till dawn should come.
