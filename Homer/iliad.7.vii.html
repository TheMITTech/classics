<A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A>With these words Hector passed through the gates, and his brother Alexandrus 
<A NAME="11"></A>with him, both eager for the fray. As when heaven sends a breeze to sailors 
<A NAME="12"></A>who have long looked for one in vain, and have laboured at their oars till 
<A NAME="13"></A>they are faint with toil, even so welcome was the sight of these two heroes 
<A NAME="14"></A>to the Trojans.
<A NAME="15"></A><BR><BR>Thereon Alexandrus killed Menesthius the son of Areithous; he lived 
<A NAME="16"></A>in Ame, and was son of Areithous the Mace-man, and of Phylomedusa. Hector 
<A NAME="17"></A>threw a spear at Eioneus and struck him dead with a wound in the neck under 
<A NAME="18"></A>the bronze rim of his helmet. Glaucus, moreover, son of Hippolochus, captain 
<A NAME="19"></A>of the Lycians, in hard hand-to-hand fight smote Iphinous son of Dexius 
<A NAME="20"></A>on the shoulder, as he was springing on to his chariot behind his fleet 
<A NAME="21"></A>mares; so he fell to earth from the car, and there was no life left in 
<A NAME="22"></A>him.
<A NAME="23"></A><BR><BR>When, therefore, Minerva saw these men making havoc of the Argives, 
<A NAME="24"></A>she darted down to Ilius from the summits of Olympus, and Apollo, who was 
<A NAME="25"></A>looking on from Pergamus, went out to meet her; for he wanted the Trojans 
<A NAME="26"></A>to be victorious. The pair met by the oak tree, and King Apollo son of 
<A NAME="27"></A>Jove was first to speak. "What would you have said he, "daughter of great 
<A NAME="28"></A>Jove, that your proud spirit has sent you hither from Olympus? Have you 
<A NAME="29"></A>no pity upon the Trojans, and would you incline the scales of victory in 
<A NAME="30"></A>favour of the Danaans? Let me persuade you- for it will be better thus- 
<A NAME="31"></A>stay the combat for to-day, but let them renew the fight hereafter till 
<A NAME="32"></A>they compass the doom of Ilius, since you goddesses have made up your minds 
<A NAME="33"></A>to destroy the city."
<A NAME="34"></A><BR><BR>And Minerva answered, "So be it, Far-Darter; it was in this mind 
<A NAME="35"></A>that I came down from Olympus to the Trojans and Achaeans. Tell me, then, 
<A NAME="36"></A>how do you propose to end this present fighting?"
<A NAME="37"></A><BR><BR>Apollo, son of Jove, replied, "Let us incite great Hector to challenge 
<A NAME="38"></A>some one of the Danaans in single combat; on this the Achaeans will be 
<A NAME="39"></A>shamed into finding a man who will fight him."
<A NAME="40"></A><BR><BR>Minerva assented, and Helenus son of Priam divined the counsel 
<A NAME="41"></A>of the gods; he therefore went up to Hector and said, "Hector son of Priam, 
<A NAME="42"></A>peer of gods in counsel, I am your brother, let me then persuade you. Bid 
<A NAME="43"></A>the other Trojans and Achaeans all of them take their seats, and challenge 
<A NAME="44"></A>the best man among the Achaeans to meet you in single combat. I have heard 
<A NAME="45"></A>the voice of the ever-living gods, and the hour of your doom is not yet 
<A NAME="46"></A>come."
<A NAME="47"></A><BR><BR>Hector was glad when he heard this saying, and went in among the 
<A NAME="48"></A>Trojans, grasping his spear by the middle to hold them back, and they all 
<A NAME="49"></A>sat down. Agamemnon also bade the Achaeans be seated. But Minerva and Apollo, 
<A NAME="50"></A>in the likeness of vultures, perched on father Jove's high oak tree, proud 
<A NAME="51"></A>of their men; and the ranks sat close ranged together, bristling with shield 
<A NAME="52"></A>and helmet and spear. As when the rising west wind furs the face of the 
<A NAME="53"></A>sea and the waters grow dark beneath it, so sat the companies of Trojans 
<A NAME="54"></A>and Achaeans upon the plain. And Hector spoke thus:-
<A NAME="55"></A><BR><BR>"Hear me, Trojans and Achaeans, that I may speak even as I am minded; 
<A NAME="56"></A>Jove on his high throne has brought our oaths and covenants to nothing, 
<A NAME="57"></A>and foreshadows ill for both of us, till you either take the towers of 
<A NAME="58"></A>Troy, or are yourselves vanquished at your ships. The princes of the Achaeans 
<A NAME="59"></A>are here present in the midst of you; let him, then, that will fight me 
<A NAME="60"></A>stand forward as your champion against Hector. Thus I say, and may Jove 
<A NAME="61"></A>be witness between us. If your champion slay me, let him strip me of my 
<A NAME="62"></A>armour and take it to your ships, but let him send my body home that the 
<A NAME="63"></A>Trojans and their wives may give me my dues of fire when I am dead. In 
<A NAME="64"></A>like manner, if Apollo vouchsafe me glory and I slay your champion, I will 
<A NAME="65"></A>strip him of his armour and take it to the city of Ilius, where I will 
<A NAME="66"></A>hang it in the temple of Apollo, but I will give up his body, that the 
<A NAME="67"></A>Achaeans may bury him at their ships, and the build him a mound by the 
<A NAME="68"></A>wide waters of the Hellespont. Then will one say hereafter as he sails 
<A NAME="69"></A>his ship over the sea, 'This is the monument of one who died long since 
<A NAME="70"></A>a champion who was slain by mighty Hector.' Thus will one say, and my fame 
<A NAME="71"></A>shall not be lost."
<A NAME="72"></A><BR><BR>Thus did he speak, but they all held their peace, ashamed to decline 
<A NAME="73"></A>the challenge, yet fearing to accept it, till at last Menelaus rose and 
<A NAME="74"></A>rebuked them, for he was angry. "Alas," he cried, "vain braggarts, women 
<A NAME="75"></A>forsooth not men, double-dyed indeed will be the stain upon us if no man 
<A NAME="76"></A>of the Danaans will now face Hector. May you be turned every man of you 
<A NAME="77"></A>into earth and water as you sit spiritless and inglorious in your places. 
<A NAME="78"></A>I will myself go out against this man, but the upshot of the fight will 
<A NAME="79"></A>be from on high in the hands of the immortal gods."
<A NAME="80"></A><BR><BR>With these words he put on his armour; and then, O Menelaus, your 
<A NAME="81"></A>life would have come to an end at the hands of hands of Hector, for he 
<A NAME="82"></A>was far better the man, had not the princes of the Achaeans sprung upon 
<A NAME="83"></A>you and checked you. King Agamemnon caught him by the right hand and said, 
<A NAME="84"></A>"Menelaus, you are mad; a truce to this folly. Be patient in spite of passion, 
<A NAME="85"></A>do not think of fighting a man so much stronger than yourself as Hector 
<A NAME="86"></A>son of Priam, who is feared by many another as well as you. Even Achilles, 
<A NAME="87"></A>who is far more doughty than you are, shrank from meeting him in battle. 
<A NAME="88"></A>Sit down your own people, and the Achaeans will send some other champion 
<A NAME="89"></A>to fight Hector; fearless and fond of battle though he be, I ween his knees 
<A NAME="90"></A>will bend gladly under him if he comes out alive from the hurly-burly of 
<A NAME="91"></A>this fight."
<A NAME="92"></A><BR><BR>With these words of reasonable counsel he persuaded his brother, 
<A NAME="93"></A>whereon his squires gladly stripped the armour from off his shoulders. 
<A NAME="94"></A>Then Nestor rose and spoke, "Of a truth," said he, "the Achaean land is 
<A NAME="95"></A>fallen upon evil times. The old knight Peleus, counsellor and orator among 
<A NAME="96"></A>the Myrmidons, loved when I was in his house to question me concerning 
<A NAME="97"></A>the race and lineage of all the Argives. How would it not grieve him could 
<A NAME="98"></A>he hear of them as now quailing before Hector? Many a time would he lift 
<A NAME="99"></A>his hands in prayer that his soul might leave his body and go down within 
<A NAME="100"></A>the house of Hades. Would, by father Jove, Minerva, and Apollo, that I 
<A NAME="101"></A>were still young and strong as when the Pylians and Arcadians were gathered 
<A NAME="102"></A>in fight by the rapid river Celadon under the walls of Pheia, and round 
<A NAME="103"></A>about the waters of the river Iardanus. The godlike hero Ereuthalion stood 
<A NAME="104"></A>forward as their champion, with the armour of King Areithous upon his shoulders- 
<A NAME="105"></A>Areithous whom men and women had surnamed 'the Mace-man,' because he fought 
<A NAME="106"></A>neither with bow nor spear, but broke the battalions of the foe with his 
<A NAME="107"></A>iron mace. Lycurgus killed him, not in fair fight, but by entrapping him 
<A NAME="108"></A>in a narrow way where his mace served him in no stead; for Lycurgus was 
<A NAME="109"></A>too quick for him and speared him through the middle, so he fell to earth 
<A NAME="110"></A>on his back. Lycurgus then spoiled him of the armour which Mars had given 
<A NAME="111"></A>him, and bore it in battle thenceforward; but when he grew old and stayed 
<A NAME="112"></A>at home, he gave it to his faithful squire Ereuthalion, who in this same 
<A NAME="113"></A>armour challenged the foremost men among us. The others quaked and quailed, 
<A NAME="114"></A>but my high spirit bade me fight him though none other would venture; I 
<A NAME="115"></A>was the youngest man of them all; but when I fought him Minerva vouchsafed 
<A NAME="116"></A>me victory. He was the biggest and strongest man that ever I killed, and 
<A NAME="117"></A>covered much ground as he lay sprawling upon the earth. Would that I were 
<A NAME="118"></A>still young and strong as I then was, for the son of Priam would then soon 
<A NAME="119"></A>find one who would face him. But you, foremost among the whole host though 
<A NAME="120"></A>you be, have none of you any stomach for fighting Hector."
<A NAME="121"></A><BR><BR>Thus did the old man rebuke them, and forthwith nine men started 
<A NAME="122"></A>to their feet. Foremost of all uprose King Agamemnon, and after him brave 
<A NAME="123"></A>Diomed the son of Tydeus. Next were the two Ajaxes, men clothed in valour 
<A NAME="124"></A>as with a garment, and then Idomeneus, and Meriones his brother in arms. 
<A NAME="125"></A>After these Eurypylus son of Euaemon, Thoas the son of Andraemon, and Ulysses 
<A NAME="126"></A>also rose. Then Nestor knight of Gerene again spoke, saying: "Cast lots 
<A NAME="127"></A>among you to see who shall be chosen. If he come alive out of this fight 
<A NAME="128"></A>he will have done good service alike to his own soul and to the 
<A NAME="129"></A>Achaeans."
<A NAME="130"></A><BR><BR>Thus he spoke, and when each of them had marked his lot, and had 
<A NAME="131"></A>thrown it into the helmet of Agamemnon son of Atreus, the people lifted 
<A NAME="132"></A>their hands in prayer, and thus would one of them say as he looked into 
<A NAME="133"></A>the vault of heaven, "Father Jove, grant that the lot fall on Ajax, or 
<A NAME="134"></A>on the son of Tydeus, or upon the king of rich Mycene 
<A NAME="135"></A>himself."
<A NAME="136"></A><BR><BR>As they were speaking, Nestor knight of Gerene shook the helmet, 
<A NAME="137"></A>and from it there fell the very lot which they wanted- the lot of Ajax. 
<A NAME="138"></A>The herald bore it about and showed it to all the chieftains of the Achaeans, 
<A NAME="139"></A>going from left to right; but they none of of them owned it. When, however, 
<A NAME="140"></A>in due course he reached the man who had written upon it and had put it 
<A NAME="141"></A>into the helmet, brave Ajax held out his hand, and the herald gave him 
<A NAME="142"></A>the lot. When Ajax saw him mark he knew it and was glad; he threw it to 
<A NAME="143"></A>the ground and said, "My friends, the lot is mine, and I rejoice, for I 
<A NAME="144"></A>shall vanquish Hector. I will put on my armour; meanwhile, pray to King 
<A NAME="145"></A>Jove in silence among yourselves that the Trojans may not hear you- or 
<A NAME="146"></A>aloud if you will, for we fear no man. None shall overcome me, neither 
<A NAME="147"></A>by force nor cunning, for I was born and bred in Salamis, and can hold 
<A NAME="148"></A>my own in all things."
<A NAME="149"></A><BR><BR>With this they fell praying to King Jove the son of Saturn, and 
<A NAME="150"></A>thus would one of them say as he looked into the vault of heaven, "Father 
<A NAME="151"></A>Jove that rulest from Ida, most glorious in power, vouchsafe victory to 
<A NAME="152"></A>Ajax, and let him win great glory: but if you wish well to Hector also 
<A NAME="153"></A>and would protect him, grant to each of them equal fame and 
<A NAME="154"></A>prowess.
<A NAME="155"></A><BR><BR>Thus they prayed, and Ajax armed himself in his suit of gleaming 
<A NAME="156"></A>bronze. When he was in full array he sprang forward as monstrous Mars when 
<A NAME="157"></A>he takes part among men whom Jove has set fighting with one another- even 
<A NAME="158"></A>so did huge Ajax, bulwark of the Achaeans, spring forward with a grim smile 
<A NAME="159"></A>on his face as he brandished his long spear and strode onward. The Argives 
<A NAME="160"></A>were elated as they beheld him, but the Trojans trembled in every limb, 
<A NAME="161"></A>and the heart even of Hector beat quickly, but he could not now retreat 
<A NAME="162"></A>and withdraw into the ranks behind him, for he had been the challenger. 
<A NAME="163"></A>Ajax came up bearing his shield in front of him like a wall- a shield of 
<A NAME="164"></A>bronze with seven folds of oxhide- the work of Tychius, who lived in Hyle 
<A NAME="165"></A>and was by far the best worker in leather. He had made it with the hides 
<A NAME="166"></A>of seven full-fed bulls, and over these he had set an eighth layer of bronze. 
<A NAME="167"></A>Holding this shield before him, Ajax son of Telamon came close up to Hector, 
<A NAME="168"></A>and menaced him saying, "Hector, you shall now learn, man to man, what 
<A NAME="169"></A>kind of champions the Danaans have among them even besides lion-hearted 
<A NAME="170"></A>Achilles cleaver of the ranks of men. He now abides at the ships in anger 
<A NAME="171"></A>with Agamemnon shepherd of his people, but there are many of us who are 
<A NAME="172"></A>well able to face you; therefore begin the fight."
<A NAME="173"></A><BR><BR>And Hector answered, "Noble Ajax, son of Telamon, captain of the 
<A NAME="174"></A>host, treat me not as though I were some puny boy or woman that cannot 
<A NAME="175"></A>fight. I have been long used to the blood and butcheries of battle. I am 
<A NAME="176"></A>quick to turn my leathern shield either to right or left, for this I deem 
<A NAME="177"></A>the main thing in battle. I can charge among the chariots and horsemen, 
<A NAME="178"></A>and in hand to hand fighting can delight the heart of Mars; howbeit I would 
<A NAME="179"></A>not take such a man as you are off his guard- but I will smite you openly 
<A NAME="180"></A>if I can."
<A NAME="181"></A><BR><BR>He poised his spear as he spoke, and hurled it from him. It struck 
<A NAME="182"></A>the sevenfold shield in its outermost layer- the eighth, which was of bronze- 
<A NAME="183"></A>and went through six of the layers but in the seventh hide it stayed. Then 
<A NAME="184"></A>Ajax threw in his turn, and struck the round shield of the son of Priam. 
<A NAME="185"></A>The terrible spear went through his gleaming shield, and pressed onward 
<A NAME="186"></A>through his cuirass of cunning workmanship; it pierced the shirt against 
<A NAME="187"></A>his side, but he swerved and thus saved his life. They then each of them 
<A NAME="188"></A>drew out the spear from his shield, and fell on one another like savage 
<A NAME="189"></A>lions or wild boars of great strength and endurance: the son of Priam struck 
<A NAME="190"></A>the middle of Ajax's shield, but the bronze did not break, and the point 
<A NAME="191"></A>of his dart was turned. Ajax then sprang forward and pierced the shield 
<A NAME="192"></A>of Hector; the spear went through it and staggered him as he was springing 
<A NAME="193"></A>forward to attack; it gashed his neck and the blood came pouring from the 
<A NAME="194"></A>wound, but even so Hector did not cease fighting; he gave ground, and with 
<A NAME="195"></A>his brawny hand seized a stone, rugged and huge, that was lying upon the 
<A NAME="196"></A>plain; with this he struck the shield of Ajax on the boss that was in its 
<A NAME="197"></A>middle, so that the bronze rang again. But Ajax in turn caught up a far 
<A NAME="198"></A>larger stone, swung it aloft, and hurled it with prodigious force. This 
<A NAME="199"></A>millstone of a rock broke Hector's shield inwards and threw him down on 
<A NAME="200"></A>his back with the shield crushing him under it, but Apollo raised him at 
<A NAME="201"></A>once. Thereon they would have hacked at one another in close combat with 
<A NAME="202"></A>their swords, had not heralds, messengers of gods and men, come forward, 
<A NAME="203"></A>one from the Trojans and the other from the Achaeans- Talthybius and Idaeus 
<A NAME="204"></A>both of them honourable men; these parted them with their staves, and the 
<A NAME="205"></A>good herald Idaeus said, "My sons, fight no longer, you are both of you 
<A NAME="206"></A>valiant, and both are dear to Jove; we know this; but night is now falling, 
<A NAME="207"></A>and the behests of night may not be well gainsaid."
<A NAME="208"></A><BR><BR>Ajax son of Telamon answered, "Idaeus, bid Hector say so, for it 
<A NAME="209"></A>was he that challenged our princes. Let him speak first and I will accept 
<A NAME="210"></A>his saying."
<A NAME="211"></A><BR><BR>Then Hector said, "Ajax, heaven has vouchsafed you stature and 
<A NAME="212"></A>strength, and judgement; and in wielding the spear you excel all others 
<A NAME="213"></A>of the Achaeans. Let us for this day cease fighting; hereafter we will 
<A NAME="214"></A>fight anew till heaven decide between us, and give victory to one or to 
<A NAME="215"></A>the other; night is now falling, and the behests of night may not be well 
<A NAME="216"></A>gainsaid. Gladden, then, the hearts of the Achaeans at your ships, and 
<A NAME="217"></A>more especially those of your own followers and clansmen, while I, in the 
<A NAME="218"></A>great city of King Priam, bring comfort to the Trojans and their women, 
<A NAME="219"></A>who vie with one another in their prayers on my behalf. Let us, moreover, 
<A NAME="220"></A>exchange presents that it may be said among the Achaeans and Trojans, 'They 
<A NAME="221"></A>fought with might and main, but were reconciled and parted in 
<A NAME="222"></A>friendship.'
<A NAME="223"></A><BR><BR>On this he gave Ajax a silver-studded sword with its sheath and 
<A NAME="224"></A>leathern baldric, and in return Ajax gave him a girdle dyed with purple. 
<A NAME="225"></A>Thus they parted, the one going to the host of the Achaeans, and the other 
<A NAME="226"></A>to that of the Trojans, who rejoiced when they saw their hero come to them 
<A NAME="227"></A>safe and unharmed from the strong hands of mighty Ajax. They led him, therefore, 
<A NAME="228"></A>to the city as one that had been saved beyond their hopes. On the other 
<A NAME="229"></A>side the Achaeans brought Ajax elated with victory to 
<A NAME="230"></A>Agamemnon.
<A NAME="231"></A><BR><BR>When they reached the quarters of the son of Atreus, Agamemnon 
<A NAME="232"></A>sacrificed for them a five-year-old bull in honour of Jove the son of Saturn. 
<A NAME="233"></A>They flayed the carcass, made it ready, and divided it into joints; these 
<A NAME="234"></A>they cut carefully up into smaller pieces, putting them on the spits, roasting 
<A NAME="235"></A>them sufficiently, and then drawing them off. When they had done all this 
<A NAME="236"></A>and had prepared the feast, they ate it, and every man had his full and 
<A NAME="237"></A>equal share, so that all were satisfied, and King Agamemnon gave Ajax some 
<A NAME="238"></A>slices cut lengthways down the loin, as a mark of special honour. As soon 
<A NAME="239"></A>as they had had enough to cat and drink, old Nestor whose counsel was ever 
<A NAME="240"></A>truest began to speak; with all sincerity and goodwill, therefore, he addressed 
<A NAME="241"></A>them thus:-
<A NAME="242"></A><BR><BR>"Son of Atreus, and other chieftains, inasmuch as many of the Achaeans 
<A NAME="243"></A>are now dead, whose blood Mars has shed by the banks of the Scamander, 
<A NAME="244"></A>and their souls have gone down to the house of Hades, it will be well when 
<A NAME="245"></A>morning comes that we should cease fighting; we will then wheel our dead 
<A NAME="246"></A>together with oxen and mules and burn them not far from the ships, that 
<A NAME="247"></A>when we sail hence we may take the bones of our comrades home to their 
<A NAME="248"></A>children. Hard by the funeral pyre we will build a barrow that shall be 
<A NAME="249"></A>raised from the plain for all in common; near this let us set about building 
<A NAME="250"></A>a high wall, to shelter ourselves and our ships, and let it have well-made 
<A NAME="251"></A>gates that there may be a way through them for our chariots. Close outside 
<A NAME="252"></A>we will dig a deep trench all round it to keep off both horse and foot, 
<A NAME="253"></A>that the Trojan chieftains may not bear hard upon us."
<A NAME="254"></A><BR><BR>Thus he spoke, and the princess shouted in applause. Meanwhile 
<A NAME="255"></A>the Trojans held a council, angry and full of discord, on the acropolis 
<A NAME="256"></A>by the gates of King Priam's palace; and wise Antenor spoke. "Hear me he 
<A NAME="257"></A>said, "Trojans, Dardanians, and allies, that I may speak even as I am minded. 
<A NAME="258"></A>Let us give up Argive Helen and her wealth to the sons of Atreus, for we 
<A NAME="259"></A>are now fighting in violation of our solemn covenants, and shall not prosper 
<A NAME="260"></A>till we have done as I say."
<A NAME="261"></A><BR><BR>He then sat down and Alexandrus husband of lovely Helen rose to 
<A NAME="262"></A>speak. "Antenor," said he, "your words are not to my liking; you can find 
<A NAME="263"></A>a better saying than this if you will; if, however, you have spoken in 
<A NAME="264"></A>good earnest, then indeed has heaven robbed you of your reason. I will 
<A NAME="265"></A>speak plainly, and hereby notify to the Trojans that I will not give up 
<A NAME="266"></A>the woman; but the wealth that I brought home with her from Argos I will 
<A NAME="267"></A>restore, and will add yet further of my own."
<A NAME="268"></A><BR><BR>On this, when Paris had spoken and taken his seat, Priam of the 
<A NAME="269"></A>race of Dardanus, peer of gods in council, rose and with all sincerity 
<A NAME="270"></A>and goodwill addressed them thus: "Hear me, Trojans, Dardanians, and allies, 
<A NAME="271"></A>that I may speak even as I am minded. Get your suppers now as hitherto 
<A NAME="272"></A>throughout the city, but keep your watches and be wakeful. At daybreak 
<A NAME="273"></A>let Idaeus go to the ships, and tell Agamemnon and Menelaus sons of Atreus 
<A NAME="274"></A>the saying of Alexandrus through whom this quarrel has come about; and 
<A NAME="275"></A>let him also be instant with them that they now cease fighting till we 
<A NAME="276"></A>burn our dead; hereafter we will fight anew, till heaven decide between 
<A NAME="277"></A>us and give victory to one or to the other."
<A NAME="278"></A><BR><BR>Thus did he speak, and they did even as he had said. They took 
<A NAME="279"></A>supper in their companies and at daybreak Idaeus went his wa to the ships. 
<A NAME="280"></A>He found the Danaans, servants of Mars, in council at the stern of Agamemnon's 
<A NAME="281"></A>ship, and took his place in the midst of them. "Son of Atreus," he said, 
<A NAME="282"></A>"and princes of the Achaean host, Priam and the other noble Trojans have 
<A NAME="283"></A>sent me to tell you the saying of Alexandrus through whom this quarrel 
<A NAME="284"></A>has come about, if so be that you may find it acceptable. All the treasure 
<A NAME="285"></A>he took with him in his ships to Troy- would that he had sooner perished- 
<A NAME="286"></A>he will restore, and will add yet further of his own, but he will not give 
<A NAME="287"></A>up the wedded wife of Menelaus, though the Trojans would have him do so. 
<A NAME="288"></A>Priam bade me inquire further if you will cease fighting till we burn our 
<A NAME="289"></A>dead; hereafter we will fight anew, till heaven decide between us and give 
<A NAME="290"></A>victory to one or to the other."
<A NAME="291"></A><BR><BR>They all held their peace, but presently Diomed of the loud war-cry 
<A NAME="292"></A>spoke, saying, "Let there be no taking, neither treasure, nor yet Helen, 
<A NAME="293"></A>for even a child may see that the doom of the Trojans is at 
<A NAME="294"></A>hand."
<A NAME="295"></A><BR><BR>The sons of the Achaeans shouted applause at the words that Diomed 
<A NAME="296"></A>had spoken, and thereon King Agamemnon said to Idaeus, "Idaeus, you have 
<A NAME="297"></A>heard the answer the Achaeans make you-and I with them. But as concerning 
<A NAME="298"></A>the dead, I give you leave to burn them, for when men are once dead there 
<A NAME="299"></A>should be no grudging them the rites of fire. Let Jove the mighty husband 
<A NAME="300"></A>of Juno be witness to this covenant."
<A NAME="301"></A><BR><BR>As he spoke he upheld his sceptre in the sight of all the gods, 
<A NAME="302"></A>and Idaeus went back to the strong city of Ilius. The Trojans and Dardanians 
<A NAME="303"></A>were gathered in council waiting his return; when he came, he stood in 
<A NAME="304"></A>their midst and delivered his message. As soon as they heard it they set 
<A NAME="305"></A>about their twofold labour, some to gather the corpses, and others to bring 
<A NAME="306"></A>in wood. The Argives on their part also hastened from their ships, some 
<A NAME="307"></A>to gather the corpses, and others to bring in wood.
<A NAME="308"></A><BR><BR>The sun was beginning to beat upon the fields, fresh risen into 
<A NAME="309"></A>the vault of heaven from the slow still currents of deep Oceanus, when 
<A NAME="310"></A>the two armies met. They could hardly recognise their dead, but they washed 
<A NAME="311"></A>the clotted gore from off them, shed tears over them, and lifted them upon 
<A NAME="312"></A>their waggons. Priam had forbidden the Trojans to wail aloud, so they heaped 
<A NAME="313"></A>their dead sadly and silently upon the pyre, and having burned them went 
<A NAME="314"></A>back to the city of Ilius. The Achaeans in like manner heaped their dead 
<A NAME="315"></A>sadly and silently on the pyre, and having burned them went back to their 
<A NAME="316"></A>ships.
<A NAME="317"></A><BR><BR>Now in the twilight when it was not yet dawn, chosen bands of the 
<A NAME="318"></A>Achaeans were gathered round the pyre and built one barrow that was raised 
<A NAME="319"></A>in common for all, and hard by this they built a high wall to shelter themselves 
<A NAME="320"></A>and their ships; they gave it strong gates that there might be a way through 
<A NAME="321"></A>them for their chariots, and close outside it they dug a trench deep and 
<A NAME="322"></A>wide, and they planted it within with stakes.
<A NAME="323"></A><BR><BR>Thus did the Achaeans toil, and the gods, seated by the side of 
<A NAME="324"></A>Jove the lord of lightning, marvelled at their great work; but Neptune, 
<A NAME="325"></A>lord of the earthquake, spoke, saying, "Father Jove, what mortal in the 
<A NAME="326"></A>whole world will again take the gods into his counsel? See you not how 
<A NAME="327"></A>the Achaeans have built a wall about their ships and driven a trench all 
<A NAME="328"></A>round it, without offering hecatombs to the gods? The The fame of this 
<A NAME="329"></A>wall will reach as far as dawn itself, and men will no longer think anything 
<A NAME="330"></A>of the one which Phoebus Apollo and myself built with so much labour for 
<A NAME="331"></A>Laomedon."
<A NAME="332"></A><BR><BR>Jove was displeased and answered, "What, O shaker of the earth, 
<A NAME="333"></A>are you talking about? A god less powerful than yourself might be alarmed 
<A NAME="334"></A>at what they are doing, but your fame reaches as far as dawn itself. Surely 
<A NAME="335"></A>when the Achaeans have gone home with their ships, you can shatter their 
<A NAME="336"></A>wall and Ring it into the sea; you can cover the beach with sand again, 
<A NAME="337"></A>and the great wall of the Achaeans will then be utterly 
<A NAME="338"></A>effaced."
<A NAME="339"></A><BR><BR>Thus did they converse, and by sunset the work of the Achaeans 
<A NAME="340"></A>was completed; they then slaughtered oxen at their tents and got their 
<A NAME="341"></A>supper. Many ships had come with wine from Lemnos, sent by Euneus the son 
<A NAME="342"></A>of Jason, born to him by Hypsipyle. The son of Jason freighted them with 
<A NAME="343"></A>ten thousand measures of wine, which he sent specially to the sons of Atreus, 
<A NAME="344"></A>Agamemnon and Menelaus. From this supply the Achaeans bought their wine, 
<A NAME="345"></A>some with bronze, some with iron, some with hides, some with whole heifers, 
<A NAME="346"></A>and some again with captives. They spread a goodly banquet and feasted 
<A NAME="347"></A>the whole night through, as also did the Trojans and their allies in the 
<A NAME="348"></A>city. But all the time Jove boded them ill and roared with his portentous 
<A NAME="349"></A>thunder. Pale fear got hold upon them, and they spilled the wine from their 
<A NAME="350"></A>cups on to the ground, nor did any dare drink till he had made offerings 
<A NAME="351"></A>to the most mighty son of Saturn. Then they laid themselves down to rest 
<A NAME="352"></A>and enjoyed the boon of sleep.
