<A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A>But Minerva went to the fair city of Lacedaemon to tell Ulysses' son that 
<A NAME="11"></A>he was to return at once. She found him and Pisistratus sleeping in the 
<A NAME="12"></A>forecourt of Menelaus's house; Pisistratus was fast asleep, but Telemachus 
<A NAME="13"></A>could get no rest all night for thinking of his unhappy father, so Minerva 
<A NAME="14"></A>went close up to him and said:
<A NAME="15"></A><BR><BR>"Telemachus, you should not remain so far away from home any longer, 
<A NAME="16"></A>nor leave your property with such dangerous people in your house; they 
<A NAME="17"></A>will eat up everything you have among them, and you will have been on a 
<A NAME="18"></A>fool's errand. Ask Menelaus to send you home at once if you wish to find 
<A NAME="19"></A>your excellent mother still there when you get back. Her father and brothers 
<A NAME="20"></A>are already urging her to marry Eurymachus, who has given her more than 
<A NAME="21"></A>any of the others, and has been greatly increasing his wedding presents. 
<A NAME="22"></A>I hope nothing valuable may have been taken from the house in spite of 
<A NAME="23"></A>you, but you know what women are- they always want to do the best they 
<A NAME="24"></A>can for the man who marries them, and never give another thought to the 
<A NAME="25"></A>children of their first husband, nor to their father either when he is 
<A NAME="26"></A>dead and done with. Go home, therefore, and put everything in charge of 
<A NAME="27"></A>the most respectable woman servant that you have, until it shall please 
<A NAME="28"></A>heaven to send you a wife of your own. Let me tell you also of another 
<A NAME="29"></A>matter which you had better attend to. The chief men among the suitors 
<A NAME="30"></A>are lying in wait for you in the Strait between Ithaca and Samos, and they 
<A NAME="31"></A>mean to kill you before you can reach home. I do not much think they will 
<A NAME="32"></A>succeed; it is more likely that some of those who are now eating up your 
<A NAME="33"></A>property will find a grave themselves. Sail night and day, and keep your 
<A NAME="34"></A>ship well away from the islands; the god who watches over you and protects 
<A NAME="35"></A>you will send you a fair wind. As soon as you get to Ithaca send your ship 
<A NAME="36"></A>and men on to the town, but yourself go straight to the swineherd who has 
<A NAME="37"></A>charge your pigs; he is well disposed towards you, stay with him, therefore, 
<A NAME="38"></A>for the night, and then send him to Penelope to tell her that you have 
<A NAME="39"></A>got back safe from Pylos."
<A NAME="40"></A><BR><BR>Then she went back to Olympus; but Telemachus stirred Pisistratus 
<A NAME="41"></A>with his heel to rouse him, and said, "Wake up Pisistratus, and yoke the 
<A NAME="42"></A>horses to the chariot, for we must set off home."
<A NAME="43"></A><BR><BR>But Pisistratus said, "No matter what hurry we are in we cannot 
<A NAME="44"></A>drive in the dark. It will be morning soon; wait till Menelaus has brought 
<A NAME="45"></A>his presents and put them in the chariot for us; and let him say good-bye 
<A NAME="46"></A>to us in the usual way. So long as he lives a guest should never forget 
<A NAME="47"></A>a host who has shown him kindness."
<A NAME="48"></A><BR><BR>As he spoke day began to break, and Menelaus, who had already risen, 
<A NAME="49"></A>leaving Helen in bed, came towards them. When Telemachus saw him he put 
<A NAME="50"></A>on his shirt as fast as he could, threw a great cloak over his shoulders, 
<A NAME="51"></A>and went out to meet him. "Menelaus," said he, "let me go back now to my 
<A NAME="52"></A>own country, for I want to get home."
<A NAME="53"></A><BR><BR>And Menelaus answered, "Telemachus, if you insist on going I will 
<A NAME="54"></A>not detain you. not like to see a host either too fond of his guest or 
<A NAME="55"></A>too rude to him. Moderation is best in all things, and not letting a man 
<A NAME="56"></A>go when he wants to do so is as bad as telling him to go if he would like 
<A NAME="57"></A>to stay. One should treat a guest well as long as he is in the house and 
<A NAME="58"></A>speed him when he wants to leave it. Wait, then, till I can get your beautiful 
<A NAME="59"></A>presents into your chariot, and till you have yourself seen them. I will 
<A NAME="60"></A>tell the women to prepare a sufficient dinner for you of what there may 
<A NAME="61"></A>be in the house; it will be at once more proper and cheaper for you to 
<A NAME="62"></A>get your dinner before setting out on such a long journey. If, moreover, 
<A NAME="63"></A>you have a fancy for making a tour in Hellas or in the Peloponnese, I will 
<A NAME="64"></A>yoke my horses, and will conduct you myself through all our principal cities. 
<A NAME="65"></A>No one will send us away empty handed; every one will give us something- 
<A NAME="66"></A>a bronze tripod, a couple of mules, or a gold cup."
<A NAME="67"></A><BR><BR>"Menelaus," replied Telemachus, "I want to go home at once, for 
<A NAME="68"></A>when I came away I left my property without protection, and fear that while 
<A NAME="69"></A>looking for my father I shall come to ruin myself, or find that something 
<A NAME="70"></A>valuable has been stolen during my absence."
<A NAME="71"></A><BR><BR>When Menelaus heard this he immediately told his wife and servants 
<A NAME="72"></A>to prepare a sufficient dinner from what there might be in the house. At 
<A NAME="73"></A>this moment Eteoneus joined him, for he lived close by and had just got 
<A NAME="74"></A>up; so Menelaus told him to light the fire and cook some meat, which he 
<A NAME="75"></A>at once did. Then Menelaus went down into his fragrant store room, not 
<A NAME="76"></A>alone, but Helen went too, with Megapenthes. When he reached the place 
<A NAME="77"></A>where the treasures of his house were kept, he selected a double cup, and 
<A NAME="78"></A>told his son Megapenthes to bring also a silver mixing-bowl. Meanwhile 
<A NAME="79"></A>Helen went to the chest where she kept the lovely dresses which she had 
<A NAME="80"></A>made with her own hands, and took out one that was largest and most beautifully 
<A NAME="81"></A>enriched with embroidery; it glittered like a star, and lay at the very 
<A NAME="82"></A>bottom of the chest. Then they all came back through the house again till 
<A NAME="83"></A>they got to Telemachus, and Menelaus said, "Telemachus, may Jove, the mighty 
<A NAME="84"></A>husband of Juno, bring you safely home according to your desire. I will 
<A NAME="85"></A>now present you with the finest and most precious piece of plate in all 
<A NAME="86"></A>my house. It is a mixing-bowl of pure silver, except the rim, which is 
<A NAME="87"></A>inlaid with gold, and it is the work of Vulcan. Phaedimus king of the Sidonians 
<A NAME="88"></A>made me a present of it in the course of a visit that I paid him while 
<A NAME="89"></A>I was on my return home. I should like to give it to 
<A NAME="90"></A>you."
<A NAME="91"></A><BR><BR>With these words he placed the double cup in the hands of Telemachus, 
<A NAME="92"></A>while Megapenthes brought the beautiful mixing-bowl and set it before him. 
<A NAME="93"></A>Hard by stood lovely Helen with the robe ready in her 
<A NAME="94"></A>hand.
<A NAME="95"></A><BR><BR>"I too, my son," said she, "have something for you as a keepsake 
<A NAME="96"></A>from the hand of Helen; it is for your bride to wear upon her wedding day. 
<A NAME="97"></A>Till then, get your dear mother to keep it for you; thus may you go back 
<A NAME="98"></A>rejoicing to your own country and to your home."
<A NAME="99"></A><BR><BR>So saying she gave the robe over to him and he received it gladly. 
<A NAME="100"></A>Then Pisistratus put the presents into the chariot, and admired them all 
<A NAME="101"></A>as he did so. Presently Menelaus took Telemachus and Pisistratus into the 
<A NAME="102"></A>house, and they both of them sat down to table. A maid servant brought 
<A NAME="103"></A>them water in a beautiful golden ewer, and poured it into a silver basin 
<A NAME="104"></A>for them to wash their hands, and she drew a clean table beside them; an 
<A NAME="105"></A>upper servant brought them bread and offered them many good things of what 
<A NAME="106"></A>there was in the house. Eteoneus carved the meat and gave them each their 
<A NAME="107"></A>portions, while Megapenthes poured out the wine. Then they laid their hands 
<A NAME="108"></A>upon the good things that were before them, but as soon as they had had 
<A NAME="109"></A>had enough to eat and drink Telemachus and Pisistratus yoked the horses, 
<A NAME="110"></A>and took their places in the chariot. They drove out through the inner 
<A NAME="111"></A>gateway and under the echoing gatehouse of the outer court, and Menelaus 
<A NAME="112"></A>came after them with a golden goblet of wine in his right hand that they 
<A NAME="113"></A>might make a drink-offering before they set out. He stood in front of the 
<A NAME="114"></A>horses and pledged them, saying, "Farewell to both of you; see that you 
<A NAME="115"></A>tell Nestor how I have treated you, for he was as kind to me as any father 
<A NAME="116"></A>could be while we Achaeans were fighting before Troy."
<A NAME="117"></A><BR><BR>"We will be sure, sir," answered Telemachus, "to tell him everything 
<A NAME="118"></A>as soon as we see him. I wish I were as certain of finding Ulysses returned 
<A NAME="119"></A>when I get back to Ithaca, that I might tell him of the very great kindness 
<A NAME="120"></A>you have shown me and of the many beautiful presents I am taking with 
<A NAME="121"></A>me."
<A NAME="122"></A><BR><BR>As he was thus speaking a bird flew on his right hand- an eagle 
<A NAME="123"></A>with a great white goose in its talons which it had carried off from the 
<A NAME="124"></A>farm yard- and all the men and women were running after it and shouting. 
<A NAME="125"></A>It came quite close up to them and flew away on their right hands in front 
<A NAME="126"></A>of the horses. When they saw it they were glad, and their hearts took comfort 
<A NAME="127"></A>within them, whereon Pisistratus said, "Tell me, Menelaus, has heaven sent 
<A NAME="128"></A>this omen for us or for you?"
<A NAME="129"></A><BR><BR>Menelaus was thinking what would be the most proper answer for 
<A NAME="130"></A>him to make, but Helen was too quick for him and said, "I will read this 
<A NAME="131"></A>matter as heaven has put it in my heart, and as I doubt not that it will 
<A NAME="132"></A>come to pass. The eagle came from the mountain where it was bred and has 
<A NAME="133"></A>its nest, and in like manner Ulysses, after having travelled far and suffered 
<A NAME="134"></A>much, will return to take his revenge- if indeed he is not back already 
<A NAME="135"></A>and hatching mischief for the suitors."
<A NAME="136"></A><BR><BR>"May Jove so grant it," replied Telemachus; "if it should prove 
<A NAME="137"></A>to be so, I will make vows to you as though you were a god, even when I 
<A NAME="138"></A>am at home."
<A NAME="139"></A><BR><BR>As he spoke he lashed his horses and they started off at full speed 
<A NAME="140"></A>through the town towards the open country. They swayed the yoke upon their 
<A NAME="141"></A>necks and travelled the whole day long till the sun set and darkness was 
<A NAME="142"></A>over all the land. Then they reached Pherae, where Diocles lived who was 
<A NAME="143"></A>son of Ortilochus, the son of Alpheus. There they passed the night and 
<A NAME="144"></A>were treated hospitably. When the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, 
<A NAME="145"></A>appeared, they again yoked their horses and their places in the chariot. 
<A NAME="146"></A>They drove out through the inner gateway and under the echoing gatehouse 
<A NAME="147"></A>of the outer court. Then Pisistratus lashed his horses on and they flew 
<A NAME="148"></A>forward nothing loath; ere long they came to Pylos, and then Telemachus 
<A NAME="149"></A>said:
<A NAME="150"></A><BR><BR>"Pisistratus, I hope you will promise to do what I am going to 
<A NAME="151"></A>ask you. You know our fathers were old friends before us; moreover, we 
<A NAME="152"></A>are both of an age, and this journey has brought us together still more 
<A NAME="153"></A>closely; do not, therefore, take me past my ship, but leave me there, for 
<A NAME="154"></A>if I go to your father's house he will try to keep me in the warmth of 
<A NAME="155"></A>his good will towards me, and I must go home at once."
<A NAME="156"></A><BR><BR>Pisistratus thought how he should do as he was asked, and in the 
<A NAME="157"></A>end he deemed it best to turn his horses towards the ship, and put Menelaus's 
<A NAME="158"></A>beautiful presents of gold and raiment in the stern of the vessel. Then 
<A NAME="159"></A>he said, "Go on board at once and tell your men to do so also before I 
<A NAME="160"></A>can reach home to tell my father. I know how obstinate he is, and am sure 
<A NAME="161"></A>he will not let you go; he will come down here to fetch you, and he will 
<A NAME="162"></A>not go back without you. But he will be very angry."
<A NAME="163"></A><BR><BR>With this he drove his goodly steeds back to the city of the Pylians 
<A NAME="164"></A>and soon reached his home, but Telemachus called the men together and gave 
<A NAME="165"></A>his orders. "Now, my men," said he, "get everything in order on board the 
<A NAME="166"></A>ship, and let us set out home."
<A NAME="167"></A><BR><BR>Thus did he speak, and they went on board even as he had said. 
<A NAME="168"></A>But as Telemachus was thus busied, praying also and sacrificing to Minerva 
<A NAME="169"></A>in the ship's stern, there came to him a man from a distant country, a 
<A NAME="170"></A>seer, who was flying from Argos because he had killed a man. He was descended 
<A NAME="171"></A>from Melampus, who used to live in Pylos, the land of sheep; he was rich 
<A NAME="172"></A>and owned a great house, but he was driven into exile by the great and 
<A NAME="173"></A>powerful king Neleus. Neleus seized his goods and held them for a whole 
<A NAME="174"></A>year, during which he was a close prisoner in the house of king Phylacus, 
<A NAME="175"></A>and in much distress of mind both on account of the daughter of Neleus 
<A NAME="176"></A>and because he was haunted by a great sorrow that dread Erinyes had laid 
<A NAME="177"></A>upon him. In the end, however, he escaped with his life, drove the cattle 
<A NAME="178"></A>from Phylace to Pylos, avenged the wrong that had been done him, and gave 
<A NAME="179"></A>the daughter of Neleus to his brother. Then he left the country and went 
<A NAME="180"></A>to Argos, where it was ordained that he should reign over much people. 
<A NAME="181"></A>There he married, established himself, and had two famous sons Antiphates 
<A NAME="182"></A>and Mantius. Antiphates became father of Oicleus, and Oicleus of Amphiaraus, 
<A NAME="183"></A>who was dearly loved both by Jove and by Apollo, but he did not live to 
<A NAME="184"></A>old age, for he was killed in Thebes by reason of a woman's gifts. His 
<A NAME="185"></A>sons were Alcmaeon and Amphilochus. Mantius, the other son of Melampus, 
<A NAME="186"></A>was father to Polypheides and Cleitus. Aurora, throned in gold, carried 
<A NAME="187"></A>off Cleitus for his beauty's sake, that he might dwell among the immortals, 
<A NAME="188"></A>but Apollo made Polypheides the greatest seer in the whole world now that 
<A NAME="189"></A>Amphiaraus was dead. He quarrelled with his father and went to live in 
<A NAME="190"></A>Hyperesia, where he remained and prophesied for all 
<A NAME="191"></A>men.
<A NAME="192"></A><BR><BR>His son, Theoclymenus, it was who now came up to Telemachus as 
<A NAME="193"></A>he was making drink-offerings and praying in his ship. "Friend'" said he, 
<A NAME="194"></A>"now that I find you sacrificing in this place, I beseech you by your sacrifices 
<A NAME="195"></A>themselves, and by the god to whom you make them, I pray you also by your 
<A NAME="196"></A>own head and by those of your followers, tell me the truth and nothing 
<A NAME="197"></A>but the truth. Who and whence are you? Tell me also of your town and 
<A NAME="198"></A>parents."
<A NAME="199"></A><BR><BR>Telemachus said, "I will answer you quite truly. I am from Ithaca, 
<A NAME="200"></A>and my father is 'Ulysses, as surely as that he ever lived. But he has 
<A NAME="201"></A>come to some miserable end. Therefore I have taken this ship and got my 
<A NAME="202"></A>crew together to see if I can hear any news of him, for he has been away 
<A NAME="203"></A>a long time."
<A NAME="204"></A><BR><BR>"I too," answered Theoclymenus, am an exile, for I have killed 
<A NAME="205"></A>a man of my own race. He has many brothers and kinsmen in Argos, and they 
<A NAME="206"></A>have great power among the Argives. I am flying to escape death at their 
<A NAME="207"></A>hands, and am thus doomed to be a wanderer on the face of the earth. I 
<A NAME="208"></A>am your suppliant; take me, therefore, on board your ship that they may 
<A NAME="209"></A>not kill me, for I know they are in pursuit."
<A NAME="210"></A><BR><BR>"I will not refuse you," replied Telemachus, "if you wish to join 
<A NAME="211"></A>us. Come, therefore, and in Ithaca we will treat you hospitably according 
<A NAME="212"></A>to what we have."
<A NAME="213"></A><BR><BR>On this he received Theoclymenus' spear and laid it down on the 
<A NAME="214"></A>deck of the ship. He went on board and sat in the stern, bidding Theoclymenus 
<A NAME="215"></A>sit beside him; then the men let go the hawsers. Telemachus told them to 
<A NAME="216"></A>catch hold of the ropes, and they made all haste to do so. They set the 
<A NAME="217"></A>mast in its socket in the cross plank, raised it and made it fast with 
<A NAME="218"></A>the forestays, and they hoisted their white sails with sheets of twisted 
<A NAME="219"></A>ox hide. Minerva sent them a fair wind that blew fresh and strong to take 
<A NAME="220"></A>the ship on her course as fast as possible. Thus then they passed by Crouni 
<A NAME="221"></A>and Chalcis.
<A NAME="222"></A><BR><BR>Presently the sun set and darkness was over all the land. The vessel 
<A NAME="223"></A>made a quick pass sage to Pheae and thence on to Elis, where the Epeans 
<A NAME="224"></A>rule. Telemachus then headed her for the flying islands, wondering within 
<A NAME="225"></A>himself whether he should escape death or should be taken 
<A NAME="226"></A>prisoner.
<A NAME="227"></A><BR><BR>Meanwhile Ulysses and the swineherd were eating their supper in 
<A NAME="228"></A>the hut, and the men supped with them. As soon as they had had to eat and 
<A NAME="229"></A>drink, Ulysses began trying to prove the swineherd and see whether he would 
<A NAME="230"></A>continue to treat him kindly, and ask him to stay on at the station or 
<A NAME="231"></A>pack him off to the city; so he said:
<A NAME="232"></A><BR><BR>"Eumaeus, and all of you, to-morrow I want to go away and begin 
<A NAME="233"></A>begging about the town, so as to be no more trouble to you or to your men. 
<A NAME="234"></A>Give me your advice therefore, and let me have a good guide to go with 
<A NAME="235"></A>me and show me the way. I will go the round of the city begging as I needs 
<A NAME="236"></A>must, to see if any one will give me a drink and a piece of bread. I should 
<A NAME="237"></A>like also to go to the house of Ulysses and bring news of her husband to 
<A NAME="238"></A>queen Penelope. I could then go about among the suitors and see if out 
<A NAME="239"></A>of all their abundance they will give me a dinner. I should soon make them 
<A NAME="240"></A>an excellent servant in all sorts of ways. Listen and believe when I tell 
<A NAME="241"></A>you that by the blessing of Mercury who gives grace and good name to the 
<A NAME="242"></A>works of all men, there is no one living who would make a more handy servant 
<A NAME="243"></A>than I should- to put fresh wood on the fire, chop fuel, carve, cook, pour 
<A NAME="244"></A>out wine, and do all those services that poor men have to do for their 
<A NAME="245"></A>betters."
<A NAME="246"></A><BR><BR>The swineherd was very much disturbed when he heard this. "Heaven 
<A NAME="247"></A>help me," he exclaimed, "what ever can have put such a notion as that into 
<A NAME="248"></A>your head? If you go near the suitors you will be undone to a certainty, 
<A NAME="249"></A>for their pride and insolence reach the very heavens. They would never 
<A NAME="250"></A>think of taking a man like you for a servant. Their servants are all young 
<A NAME="251"></A>men, well dressed, wearing good cloaks and shirts, with well looking faces 
<A NAME="252"></A>and their hair always tidy, the tables are kept quite clean and are loaded 
<A NAME="253"></A>with bread, meat, and wine. Stay where you are, then; you are not in anybody's 
<A NAME="254"></A>way; I do not mind your being here, no more do any of the others, and when 
<A NAME="255"></A>Telemachus comes home he will give you a shirt and cloak and will send 
<A NAME="256"></A>you wherever you want to go."
<A NAME="257"></A><BR><BR>Ulysses answered, "I hope you may be as dear to the gods as you 
<A NAME="258"></A>are to me, for having saved me from going about and getting into trouble; 
<A NAME="259"></A>there is nothing worse than being always ways on the tramp; still, when 
<A NAME="260"></A>men have once got low down in the world they will go through a great deal 
<A NAME="261"></A>on behalf of their miserable bellies. Since however you press me to stay 
<A NAME="262"></A>here and await the return of Telemachus, tell about Ulysses' mother, and 
<A NAME="263"></A>his father whom he left on the threshold of old age when he set out for 
<A NAME="264"></A>Troy. Are they still living or are they already dead and in the house of 
<A NAME="265"></A>Hades?"
<A NAME="266"></A><BR><BR>"I will tell you all about them," replied Eumaeus, "Laertes is 
<A NAME="267"></A>still living and prays heaven to let him depart peacefully his own house, 
<A NAME="268"></A>for he is terribly distressed about the absence of his son, and also about 
<A NAME="269"></A>the death of his wife, which grieved him greatly and aged him more than 
<A NAME="270"></A>anything else did. She came to an unhappy end through sorrow for her son: 
<A NAME="271"></A>may no friend or neighbour who has dealt kindly by me come to such an end 
<A NAME="272"></A>as she did. As long as she was still living, though she was always grieving, 
<A NAME="273"></A>I used to like seeing her and asking her how she did, for she brought me 
<A NAME="274"></A>up along with her daughter Ctimene, the youngest of her children; we were 
<A NAME="275"></A>boy and girl together, and she made little difference between us. When, 
<A NAME="276"></A>however, we both grew up, they sent Ctimene to Same and received a splendid 
<A NAME="277"></A>dowry for her. As for me, my mistress gave me a good shirt and cloak with 
<A NAME="278"></A>a pair of sandals for my feet, and sent me off into the country, but she 
<A NAME="279"></A>was just as fond of me as ever. This is all over now. Still it has pleased 
<A NAME="280"></A>heaven to prosper my work in the situation which I now hold. I have enough 
<A NAME="281"></A>to eat and drink, and can find something for any respectable stranger who 
<A NAME="282"></A>comes here; but there is no getting a kind word or deed out of my mistress, 
<A NAME="283"></A>for the house has fallen into the hands of wicked people. Servants want 
<A NAME="284"></A>sometimes to see their mistress and have a talk with her; they like to 
<A NAME="285"></A>have something to eat and drink at the house, and something too to take 
<A NAME="286"></A>back with them into the country. This is what will keep servants in a good 
<A NAME="287"></A>humour."
<A NAME="288"></A><BR><BR>Ulysses answered, "Then you must have been a very little fellow, 
<A NAME="289"></A>Eumaeus, when you were taken so far away from your home and parents. Tell 
<A NAME="290"></A>me, and tell me true, was the city in which your father and mother lived 
<A NAME="291"></A>sacked and pillaged, or did some enemies carry you off when you were alone 
<A NAME="292"></A>tending sheep or cattle, ship you off here, and sell you for whatever your 
<A NAME="293"></A>master gave them?"
<A NAME="294"></A><BR><BR>"Stranger," replied Eumaeus, "as regards your question: sit still, 
<A NAME="295"></A>make yourself comfortable, drink your wine, and listen to me. The nights 
<A NAME="296"></A>are now at their longest; there is plenty of time both for sleeping and 
<A NAME="297"></A>sitting up talking together; you ought not to go to bed till bed time, 
<A NAME="298"></A>too much sleep is as bad as too little; if any one of the others wishes 
<A NAME="299"></A>to go to bed let him leave us and do so; he can then take my master's pigs 
<A NAME="300"></A>out when he has done breakfast in the morning. We two will sit here eating 
<A NAME="301"></A>and drinking in the hut, and telling one another stories about our misfortunes; 
<A NAME="302"></A>for when a man has suffered much, and been buffeted about in the world, 
<A NAME="303"></A>he takes pleasure in recalling the memory of sorrows that have long gone 
<A NAME="304"></A>by. As regards your question, then, my tale is as follows:
<A NAME="305"></A><BR><BR>"You may have heard of an island called Syra that lies over above 
<A NAME="306"></A>Ortygia, where the land begins to turn round and look in another direction. 
<A NAME="307"></A>It is not very thickly peopled, but the soil is good, with much pasture 
<A NAME="308"></A>fit for cattle and sheep, and it abounds with wine and wheat. Dearth never 
<A NAME="309"></A>comes there, nor are the people plagued by any sickness, but when they 
<A NAME="310"></A>grow old Apollo comes with Diana and kills them with his painless shafts. 
<A NAME="311"></A>It contains two communities, and the whole country is divided between these 
<A NAME="312"></A>two. My father Ctesius son of Ormenus, a man comparable to the gods, reigned 
<A NAME="313"></A>over both.
<A NAME="314"></A><BR><BR>"Now to this place there came some cunning traders from Phoenicia 
<A NAME="315"></A>(for the Phoenicians are great mariners) in a ship which they had freighted 
<A NAME="316"></A>with gewgaws of all kinds. There happened to be a Phoenician woman in my 
<A NAME="317"></A>father's house, very tall and comely, and an excellent servant; these scoundrels 
<A NAME="318"></A>got hold of her one day when she was washing near their ship, seduced her, 
<A NAME="319"></A>and cajoled her in ways that no woman can resist, no matter how good she 
<A NAME="320"></A>may be by nature. The man who had seduced her asked her who she was and 
<A NAME="321"></A>where she came from, and on this she told him her father's name. 'I come 
<A NAME="322"></A>from Sidon,' said she, 'and am daughter to Arybas, a man rolling in wealth. 
<A NAME="323"></A>One day as I was coming into the town from the country some Taphian pirates 
<A NAME="324"></A>seized me and took me here over the sea, where they sold me to the man 
<A NAME="325"></A>who owns this house, and he gave them their price for 
<A NAME="326"></A>me.'
<A NAME="327"></A><BR><BR>"The man who had seduced her then said, 'Would you like to come 
<A NAME="328"></A>along with us to see the house of your parents and your parents themselves? 
<A NAME="329"></A>They are both alive and are said to be well off.'
<A NAME="330"></A><BR><BR>"'I will do so gladly,' answered she, 'if you men will first swear 
<A NAME="331"></A>me a solemn oath that you will do me no harm by the 
<A NAME="332"></A>way.'
<A NAME="333"></A><BR><BR>"They all swore as she told them, and when they had completed their 
<A NAME="334"></A>oath the woman said, 'Hush; and if any of your men meets me in the street 
<A NAME="335"></A>or at the well, do not let him speak to me, for fear some one should go 
<A NAME="336"></A>and tell my master, in which case he would suspect something. He would 
<A NAME="337"></A>put me in prison, and would have all of you murdered; keep your own counsel 
<A NAME="338"></A>therefore; buy your merchandise as fast as you can, and send me word when 
<A NAME="339"></A>you have done loading. I will bring as much gold as I can lay my hands 
<A NAME="340"></A>on, and there is something else also that I can do towards paying my fare. 
<A NAME="341"></A>I am nurse to the son of the good man of the house, a funny little fellow 
<A NAME="342"></A>just able to run about. I will carry him off in your ship, and you will 
<A NAME="343"></A>get a great deal of money for him if you take him and sell him in foreign 
<A NAME="344"></A>parts.'
<A NAME="345"></A><BR><BR>"On this she went back to the house. The Phoenicians stayed a whole 
<A NAME="346"></A>year till they had loaded their ship with much precious merchandise, and 
<A NAME="347"></A>then, when they had got freight enough, they sent to tell the woman. Their 
<A NAME="348"></A>messenger, a very cunning fellow, came to my father's house bringing a 
<A NAME="349"></A>necklace of gold with amber beads strung among it; and while my mother 
<A NAME="350"></A>and the servants had it in their hands admiring it and bargaining about 
<A NAME="351"></A>it, he made a sign quietly to the woman and then went back to the ship, 
<A NAME="352"></A>whereon she took me by the hand and led me out of the house. In the fore 
<A NAME="353"></A>part of the house she saw the tables set with the cups of guests who had 
<A NAME="354"></A>been feasting with my father, as being in attendance on him; these were 
<A NAME="355"></A>now all gone to a meeting of the public assembly, so she snatched up three 
<A NAME="356"></A>cups and carried them off in the bosom of her dress, while I followed her, 
<A NAME="357"></A>for I knew no better. The sun was now set, and darkness was over all the 
<A NAME="358"></A>land, so we hurried on as fast as we could till we reached the harbour, 
<A NAME="359"></A>where the Phoenician ship was lying. When they had got on board they sailed 
<A NAME="360"></A>their ways over the sea, taking us with them, and Jove sent then a fair 
<A NAME="361"></A>wind; six days did we sail both night and day, but on the seventh day Diana 
<A NAME="362"></A>struck the woman and she fell heavily down into the ship's hold as though 
<A NAME="363"></A>she were a sea gull alighting on the water; so they threw her overboard 
<A NAME="364"></A>to the seals and fishes, and I was left all sorrowful and alone. Presently 
<A NAME="365"></A>the winds and waves took the ship to Ithaca, where Laertes gave sundry 
<A NAME="366"></A>of his chattels for me, and thus it was that ever I came to set eyes upon 
<A NAME="367"></A>this country."
<A NAME="368"></A><BR><BR>Ulysses answered, "Eumaeus, I have heard the story of your misfortunes 
<A NAME="369"></A>with the most lively interest and pity, but Jove has given you good as 
<A NAME="370"></A>well as evil, for in spite of everything you have a good master, who sees 
<A NAME="371"></A>that you always have enough to eat and drink; and you lead a good life, 
<A NAME="372"></A>whereas I am still going about begging my way from city to 
<A NAME="373"></A>city."
<A NAME="374"></A><BR><BR>Thus did they converse, and they had only a very little time left 
<A NAME="375"></A>for sleep, for it was soon daybreak. In the meantime Telemachus and his 
<A NAME="376"></A>crew were nearing land, so they loosed the sails, took down the mast, and 
<A NAME="377"></A>rowed the ship into the harbour. They cast out their mooring stones and 
<A NAME="378"></A>made fast the hawsers; they then got out upon the sea shore, mixed their 
<A NAME="379"></A>wine, and got dinner ready. As soon as they had had enough to eat and drink 
<A NAME="380"></A>Telemachus said, "Take the ship on to the town, but leave me here, for 
<A NAME="381"></A>I want to look after the herdsmen on one of my farms. In the evening, when 
<A NAME="382"></A>I have seen all I want, I will come down to the city, and to-morrow morning 
<A NAME="383"></A>in return for your trouble I will give you all a good dinner with meat 
<A NAME="384"></A>and wine."
<A NAME="385"></A><BR><BR>Then Theoclymenus said, 'And what, my dear young friend, is to 
<A NAME="386"></A>become of me? To whose house, among all your chief men, am I to repair? 
<A NAME="387"></A>or shall I go straight to your own house and to your 
<A NAME="388"></A>mother?"
<A NAME="389"></A><BR><BR>"At any other time," replied Telemachus, "I should have bidden 
<A NAME="390"></A>you go to my own house, for you would find no want of hospitality; at the 
<A NAME="391"></A>present moment, however, you would not be comfortable there, for I shall 
<A NAME="392"></A>be away, and my mother will not see you; she does not often show herself 
<A NAME="393"></A>even to the suitors, but sits at her loom weaving in an upper chamber, 
<A NAME="394"></A>out of their way; but I can tell you a man whose house you can go to- I 
<A NAME="395"></A>mean Eurymachus the son of Polybus, who is held in the highest estimation 
<A NAME="396"></A>by every one in Ithaca. He is much the best man and the most persistent 
<A NAME="397"></A>wooer, of all those who are paying court to my mother and trying to take 
<A NAME="398"></A>Ulysses' place. Jove, however, in heaven alone knows whether or no they 
<A NAME="399"></A>will come to a bad end before the marriage takes place."
<A NAME="400"></A><BR><BR>As he was speaking a bird flew by upon his right hand- a hawk, 
<A NAME="401"></A>Apollo's messenger. It held a dove in its talons, and the feathers, as 
<A NAME="402"></A>it tore them off, fell to the ground midway between Telemachus and the 
<A NAME="403"></A>ship. On this Theoclymenus called him apart and caught him by the hand. 
<A NAME="404"></A>"Telemachus," said he, "that bird did not fly on your right hand without 
<A NAME="405"></A>having been sent there by some god. As soon as I saw it I knew it was an 
<A NAME="406"></A>omen; it means that you will remain powerful and that there will be no 
<A NAME="407"></A>house in Ithaca more royal than your own."
<A NAME="408"></A><BR><BR>"I wish it may prove so," answered Telemachus. "If it does, I will 
<A NAME="409"></A>show you so much good will and give you so many presents that all who meet 
<A NAME="410"></A>you will congratulate you."
<A NAME="411"></A><BR><BR>Then he said to his friend Piraeus, "Piraeus, son of Clytius, you 
<A NAME="412"></A>have throughout shown yourself the most willing to serve me of all those 
<A NAME="413"></A>who have accompanied me to Pylos; I wish you would take this stranger to 
<A NAME="414"></A>your own house and entertain him hospitably till I can come for 
<A NAME="415"></A>him."
<A NAME="416"></A><BR><BR>And Piraeus answered, "Telemachus, you may stay away as long as 
<A NAME="417"></A>you please, but I will look after him for you, and he shall find no lack 
<A NAME="418"></A>of hospitality."
<A NAME="419"></A><BR><BR>As he spoke he went on board, and bade the others do so also and 
<A NAME="420"></A>loose the hawsers, so they took their places in the ship. But Telemachus 
<A NAME="421"></A>bound on his sandals, and took a long and doughty spear with a head of 
<A NAME="422"></A>sharpened bronze from the deck of the ship. Then they loosed the hawsers, 
<A NAME="423"></A>thrust the ship off from land, and made on towards the city as they had 
<A NAME="424"></A>been told to do, while Telemachus strode on as fast as he could, till he 
<A NAME="425"></A>reached the homestead where his countless herds of swine were feeding, 
<A NAME="426"></A>and where dwelt the excellent swineherd, who was so devoted a servant to 
<A NAME="427"></A>his master.
