<A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A>Now there came a certain common tramp who used to go begging all over the 
<A NAME="11"></A>city of Ithaca, and was notorious as an incorrigible glutton and drunkard. 
<A NAME="12"></A>This man had no strength nor stay in him, but he was a great hulking fellow 
<A NAME="13"></A>to look at; his real name, the one his mother gave him, was Arnaeus, but 
<A NAME="14"></A>the young men of the place called him Irus, because he used to run errands 
<A NAME="15"></A>for any one who would send him. As soon as he came he began to insult Ulysses, 
<A NAME="16"></A>and to try and drive him out of his own house.
<A NAME="17"></A><BR><BR>"Be off, old man," he cried, "from the doorway, or you shall be 
<A NAME="18"></A>dragged out neck and heels. Do you not see that they are all giving me 
<A NAME="19"></A>the wink, and wanting me to turn you out by force, only I do not like to 
<A NAME="20"></A>do so? Get up then, and go of yourself, or we shall come to 
<A NAME="21"></A>blows."
<A NAME="22"></A><BR><BR>Ulysses frowned on him and said, "My friend, I do you no manner 
<A NAME="23"></A>of harm; people give you a great deal, but I am not jealous. There is room 
<A NAME="24"></A>enough in this doorway for the pair of us, and you need not grudge me things 
<A NAME="25"></A>that are not yours to give. You seem to be just such another tramp as myself, 
<A NAME="26"></A>but perhaps the gods will give us better luck by and by. Do not, however, 
<A NAME="27"></A>talk too much about fighting or you will incense me, and old though I am, 
<A NAME="28"></A>I shall cover your mouth and chest with blood. I shall have more peace 
<A NAME="29"></A>to-morrow if I do, for you will not come to the house of Ulysses any 
<A NAME="30"></A>more."
<A NAME="31"></A><BR><BR>Irus was very angry and answered, "You filthy glutton, you run 
<A NAME="32"></A>on trippingly like an old fish-fag. I have a good mind to lay both hands 
<A NAME="33"></A>about you, and knock your teeth out of your head like so many boar's tusks. 
<A NAME="34"></A>Get ready, therefore, and let these people here stand by and look on. You 
<A NAME="35"></A>will never be able to fight one who is so much younger than 
<A NAME="36"></A>yourself."
<A NAME="37"></A><BR><BR>Thus roundly did they rate one another on the smooth pavement in 
<A NAME="38"></A>front of the doorway, and when Antinous saw what was going on he laughed 
<A NAME="39"></A>heartily and said to the others, "This is the finest sport that you ever 
<A NAME="40"></A>saw; heaven never yet sent anything like it into this house. The stranger 
<A NAME="41"></A>and Irus have quarreled and are going to fight, let us set them on to do 
<A NAME="42"></A>so at once."
<A NAME="43"></A><BR><BR>The suitors all came up laughing, and gathered round the two ragged 
<A NAME="44"></A>tramps. "Listen to me," said Antinous, "there are some goats' paunches 
<A NAME="45"></A>down at the fire, which we have filled with blood and fat, and set aside 
<A NAME="46"></A>for supper; he who is victorious and proves himself to be the better man 
<A NAME="47"></A>shall have his pick of the lot; he shall be free of our table and we will 
<A NAME="48"></A>not allow any other beggar about the house at all."
<A NAME="49"></A><BR><BR>The others all agreed, but Ulysses, to throw them off the scent, 
<A NAME="50"></A>said, "Sirs, an old man like myself, worn out with suffering, cannot hold 
<A NAME="51"></A>his own against a young one; but my irrepressible belly urges me on, though 
<A NAME="52"></A>I know it can only end in my getting a drubbing. You must swear, however 
<A NAME="53"></A>that none of you will give me a foul blow to favour Irus and secure him 
<A NAME="54"></A>the victory."
<A NAME="55"></A><BR><BR>They swore as he told them, and when they had completed their oath 
<A NAME="56"></A>Telemachus put in a word and said, "Stranger, if you have a mind to settle 
<A NAME="57"></A>with this fellow, you need not be afraid of any one here. Whoever strikes 
<A NAME="58"></A>you will have to fight more than one. I am host, and the other chiefs, 
<A NAME="59"></A>Antinous and Eurymachus, both of them men of understanding, are of the 
<A NAME="60"></A>same mind as I am."
<A NAME="61"></A><BR><BR>Every one assented, and Ulysses girded his old rags about his loins, 
<A NAME="62"></A>thus baring his stalwart thighs, his broad chest and shoulders, and his 
<A NAME="63"></A>mighty arms; but Minerva came up to him and made his limbs even stronger 
<A NAME="64"></A>still. The suitors were beyond measure astonished, and one would turn towards 
<A NAME="65"></A>his neighbour saying, "The stranger has brought such a thigh out of his 
<A NAME="66"></A>old rags that there will soon be nothing left of Irus."
<A NAME="67"></A><BR><BR>Irus began to be very uneasy as he heard them, but the servants 
<A NAME="68"></A>girded him by force, and brought him [into the open part of the court] 
<A NAME="69"></A>in such a fright that his limbs were all of a tremble. Antinous scolded 
<A NAME="70"></A>him and said, "You swaggering bully, you ought never to have been born 
<A NAME="71"></A>at all if you are afraid of such an old broken-down creature as this tramp 
<A NAME="72"></A>is. I say, therefore- and it shall surely be- if he beats you and proves 
<A NAME="73"></A>himself the better man, I shall pack you off on board ship to the mainland 
<A NAME="74"></A>and send you to king Echetus, who kills every one that comes near him. 
<A NAME="75"></A>He will cut off your nose and ears, and draw out your entrails for the 
<A NAME="76"></A>dogs to eat."
<A NAME="77"></A><BR><BR>This frightened Irus still more, but they brought him into the 
<A NAME="78"></A>middle of the court, and the two men raised their hands to fight. Then 
<A NAME="79"></A>Ulysses considered whether he should let drive so hard at him as to make 
<A NAME="80"></A>an end of him then and there, or whether he should give him a lighter blow 
<A NAME="81"></A>that should only knock him down; in the end he deemed it best to give the 
<A NAME="82"></A>lighter blow for fear the Achaeans should begin to suspect who he was. 
<A NAME="83"></A>Then they began to fight, and Irus hit Ulysses on the right shoulder; but 
<A NAME="84"></A>Ulysses gave Irus a blow on the neck under the ear that broke in the bones 
<A NAME="85"></A>of his skull, and the blood came gushing out of his mouth; he fell groaning 
<A NAME="86"></A>in the dust, gnashing his teeth and kicking on the ground, but the suitors 
<A NAME="87"></A>threw up their hands and nearly died of laughter, as Ulysses caught hold 
<A NAME="88"></A>of him by the foot and dragged him into the outer court as far as the gate-house. 
<A NAME="89"></A>There he propped him up against the wall and put his staff in his hands. 
<A NAME="90"></A>"Sit here," said he, "and keep the dogs and pigs off; you are a pitiful 
<A NAME="91"></A>creature, and if you try to make yourself king of the beggars any more 
<A NAME="92"></A>you shall fare still worse."
<A NAME="93"></A><BR><BR>Then he threw his dirty old wallet, all tattered and torn, over 
<A NAME="94"></A>his shoulder with the cord by which it hung, and went back to sit down 
<A NAME="95"></A>upon the threshold; but the suitors went within the cloisters, laughing 
<A NAME="96"></A>and saluting him, "May Jove, and all the other gods," said they, 'grant 
<A NAME="97"></A>you whatever you want for having put an end to the importunity of this 
<A NAME="98"></A>insatiable tramp. We will take him over to the mainland presently, to king 
<A NAME="99"></A>Echetus, who kills every one that comes near him."
<A NAME="100"></A><BR><BR>Ulysses hailed this as of good omen, and Antinous set a great goat's 
<A NAME="101"></A>paunch before him filled with blood and fat. Amphinomus took two loaves 
<A NAME="102"></A>out of the bread-basket and brought them to him, pledging him as he did 
<A NAME="103"></A>so in a golden goblet of wine. "Good luck to you," he said, "father stranger, 
<A NAME="104"></A>you are very badly off at present, but I hope you will have better times 
<A NAME="105"></A>by and by."
<A NAME="106"></A><BR><BR>To this Ulysses answered, "Amphinomus, you seem to be a man of 
<A NAME="107"></A>good understanding, as indeed you may well be, seeing whose son you are. 
<A NAME="108"></A>I have heard your father well spoken of; he is Nisus of Dulichium, a man 
<A NAME="109"></A>both brave and wealthy. They tell me you are his son, and you appear to 
<A NAME="110"></A>be a considerable person; listen, therefore, and take heed to what I am 
<A NAME="111"></A>saying. Man is the vainest of all creatures that have their being upon 
<A NAME="112"></A>earth. As long as heaven vouchsafes him health and strength, he thinks 
<A NAME="113"></A>that he shall come to no harm hereafter, and even when the blessed gods 
<A NAME="114"></A>bring sorrow upon him, he bears it as he needs must, and makes the best 
<A NAME="115"></A>of it; for God Almighty gives men their daily minds day by day. I know 
<A NAME="116"></A>all about it, for I was a rich man once, and did much wrong in the stubbornness 
<A NAME="117"></A>of my pride, and in the confidence that my father and my brothers would 
<A NAME="118"></A>support me; therefore let a man fear God in all things always, and take 
<A NAME="119"></A>the good that heaven may see fit to send him without vainglory. Consider 
<A NAME="120"></A>the infamy of what these suitors are doing; see how they are wasting the 
<A NAME="121"></A>estate, and doing dishonour to the wife, of one who is certain to return 
<A NAME="122"></A>some day, and that, too, not long hence. Nay, he will be here soon; may 
<A NAME="123"></A>heaven send you home quietly first that you may not meet with him in the 
<A NAME="124"></A>day of his coming, for once he is here the suitors and he will not part 
<A NAME="125"></A>bloodlessly."
<A NAME="126"></A><BR><BR>With these words he made a drink-offering, and when he had drunk 
<A NAME="127"></A>he put the gold cup again into the hands of Amphinomus, who walked away 
<A NAME="128"></A>serious and bowing his head, for he foreboded evil. But even so he did 
<A NAME="129"></A>not escape destruction, for Minerva had doomed him fall by the hand of 
<A NAME="130"></A>Telemachus. So he took his seat again at the place from which he had 
<A NAME="131"></A>come.
<A NAME="132"></A><BR><BR>Then Minerva put it into the mind of Penelope to show herself to 
<A NAME="133"></A>the suitors, that she might make them still more enamoured of her, and 
<A NAME="134"></A>win still further honour from her son and husband. So she feigned a mocking 
<A NAME="135"></A>laugh and said, "Eurynome, I have changed my and have a fancy to show myself 
<A NAME="136"></A>to the suitors although I detest them. I should like also to give my son 
<A NAME="137"></A>a hint that he had better not have anything more to do with them. They 
<A NAME="138"></A>speak fairly enough but they mean mischief."
<A NAME="139"></A><BR><BR>"My dear child," answered Eurynome, "all that you have said is 
<A NAME="140"></A>true, go and tell your son about it, but first wash yourself and anoint 
<A NAME="141"></A>your face. Do not go about with your cheeks all covered with tears; it 
<A NAME="142"></A>is not right that you should grieve so incessantly; for Telemachus, whom 
<A NAME="143"></A>you always prayed that you might live to see with a beard, is already grown 
<A NAME="144"></A>up."
<A NAME="145"></A><BR><BR>"I know, Eurynome," replied Penelope, "that you mean well, but 
<A NAME="146"></A>do not try and persuade me to wash and to anoint myself, for heaven robbed 
<A NAME="147"></A>me of all my beauty on the day my husband sailed; nevertheless, tell Autonoe 
<A NAME="148"></A>and Hippodamia that I want them. They must be with me when I am in the 
<A NAME="149"></A>cloister; I am not going among the men alone; it would not be proper for 
<A NAME="150"></A>me to do so."
<A NAME="151"></A><BR><BR>On this the old woman went out of the room to bid the maids go 
<A NAME="152"></A>to their mistress. In the meantime Minerva bethought her of another matter, 
<A NAME="153"></A>and sent Penelope off into a sweet slumber; so she lay down on her couch 
<A NAME="154"></A>and her limbs became heavy with sleep. Then the goddess shed grace and 
<A NAME="155"></A>beauty over her that all the Achaeans might admire her. She washed her 
<A NAME="156"></A>face with the ambrosial loveliness that Venus wears when she goes dancing 
<A NAME="157"></A>with the Graces; she made her taller and of a more commanding figure, while 
<A NAME="158"></A>as for her complexion it was whiter than sawn ivory. When Minerva had done 
<A NAME="159"></A>all this she went away, whereon the maids came in from the women's room 
<A NAME="160"></A>and woke Penelope with the sound of their talking.
<A NAME="161"></A><BR><BR>"What an exquisitely delicious sleep I have been having," said 
<A NAME="162"></A>she, as she passed her hands over her face, "in spite of all my misery. 
<A NAME="163"></A>I wish Diana would let me die so sweetly now at this very moment, that 
<A NAME="164"></A>I might no longer waste in despair for the loss of my dear husband, who 
<A NAME="165"></A>possessed every kind of good quality and was the most distinguished man 
<A NAME="166"></A>among the Achaeans."
<A NAME="167"></A><BR><BR>With these words she came down from her upper room, not alone but 
<A NAME="168"></A>attended by two of her maidens, and when she reached the suitors she stood 
<A NAME="169"></A>by one of the bearing-posts supporting the roof of the cloister, holding 
<A NAME="170"></A>a veil before her face, and with a staid maid servant on either side of 
<A NAME="171"></A>her. As they beheld her the suitors were so overpowered and became so desperately 
<A NAME="172"></A>enamoured of her, that each one prayed he might win her for his own bed 
<A NAME="173"></A>fellow.
<A NAME="174"></A><BR><BR>"Telemachus," said she, addressing her son, "I fear you are no 
<A NAME="175"></A>longer so discreet and well conducted as you used to be. When you were 
<A NAME="176"></A>younger you had a greater sense of propriety; now, however, that you are 
<A NAME="177"></A>grown up, though a stranger to look at you would take you for the son of 
<A NAME="178"></A>a well-to-do father as far as size and good looks go, your conduct is by 
<A NAME="179"></A>no means what it should be. What is all this disturbance that has been 
<A NAME="180"></A>going on, and how came you to allow a stranger to be so disgracefully ill-treated? 
<A NAME="181"></A>What would have happened if he had suffered serious injury while a suppliant 
<A NAME="182"></A>in our house? Surely this would have been very discreditable to 
<A NAME="183"></A>you."
<A NAME="184"></A><BR><BR>"I am not surprised, my dear mother, at your displeasure," replied 
<A NAME="185"></A>Telemachus, "I understand all about it and know when things are not as 
<A NAME="186"></A>they should be, which I could not do when I was younger; I cannot, however, 
<A NAME="187"></A>behave with perfect propriety at all times. First one and then another 
<A NAME="188"></A>of these wicked people here keeps driving me out of my mind, and I have 
<A NAME="189"></A>no one to stand by me. After all, however, this fight between Irus and 
<A NAME="190"></A>the stranger did not turn out as the suitors meant it to do, for the stranger 
<A NAME="191"></A>got the best of it. I wish Father Jove, Minerva, and Apollo would break 
<A NAME="192"></A>the neck of every one of these wooers of yours, some inside the house and 
<A NAME="193"></A>some out; and I wish they might all be as limp as Irus is over yonder in 
<A NAME="194"></A>the gate of the outer court. See how he nods his head like a drunken man; 
<A NAME="195"></A>he has had such a thrashing that he cannot stand on his feet nor get back 
<A NAME="196"></A>to his home, wherever that may be, for has no strength left in 
<A NAME="197"></A>him."
<A NAME="198"></A><BR><BR>Thus did they converse. Eurymachus then came up and said, "Queen 
<A NAME="199"></A>Penelope, daughter of Icarius, if all the Achaeans in Iasian Argos could 
<A NAME="200"></A>see you at this moment, you would have still more suitors in your house 
<A NAME="201"></A>by tomorrow morning, for you are the most admirable woman in the whole 
<A NAME="202"></A>world both as regards personal beauty and strength of 
<A NAME="203"></A>understanding."
<A NAME="204"></A><BR><BR>To this Penelope replied, "Eurymachus, heaven robbed me of all 
<A NAME="205"></A>my beauty whether of face or figure when the Argives set sail for Troy 
<A NAME="206"></A>and my dear husband with them. If he were to return and look after my affairs, 
<A NAME="207"></A>I should both be more respected and show a better presence to the world. 
<A NAME="208"></A>As it is, I am oppressed with care, and with the afflictions which heaven 
<A NAME="209"></A>has seen fit to heap upon me. My husband foresaw it all, and when he was 
<A NAME="210"></A>leaving home he took my right wrist in his hand- 'Wife, 'he said, 'we shall 
<A NAME="211"></A>not all of us come safe home from Troy, for the Trojans fight well both 
<A NAME="212"></A>with bow and spear. They are excellent also at fighting from chariots, 
<A NAME="213"></A>and nothing decides the issue of a fight sooner than this. I know not, 
<A NAME="214"></A>therefore, whether heaven will send me back to you, or whether I may not 
<A NAME="215"></A>fall over there at Troy. In the meantime do you look after things here. 
<A NAME="216"></A>Take care of my father and mother as at present, and even more so during 
<A NAME="217"></A>my absence, but when you see our son growing a beard, then marry whom you 
<A NAME="218"></A>will, and leave this your present home. This is what he said and now it 
<A NAME="219"></A>is all coming true. A night will come when I shall have to yield myself 
<A NAME="220"></A>to a marriage which I detest, for Jove has taken from me all hope of happiness. 
<A NAME="221"></A>This further grief, moreover, cuts me to the very heart. You suitors are 
<A NAME="222"></A>not wooing me after the custom of my country. When men are courting a woman 
<A NAME="223"></A>who they think will be a good wife to them and who is of noble birth, and 
<A NAME="224"></A>when they are each trying to win her for himself, they usually bring oxen 
<A NAME="225"></A>and sheep to feast the friends of the lady, and they make her magnificent 
<A NAME="226"></A>presents, instead of eating up other people's property without paying for 
<A NAME="227"></A>it."
<A NAME="228"></A><BR><BR>This was what she said, and Ulysses was glad when he heard her 
<A NAME="229"></A>trying to get presents out of the suitors, and flattering them with fair 
<A NAME="230"></A>words which he knew she did not mean.
<A NAME="231"></A><BR><BR>Then Antinous said, "Queen Penelope, daughter of Icarius, take 
<A NAME="232"></A>as many presents as you please from any one who will give them to you; 
<A NAME="233"></A>it is not well to refuse a present; but we will not go about our business 
<A NAME="234"></A>nor stir from where we are, till you have married the best man among us 
<A NAME="235"></A>whoever he may be."
<A NAME="236"></A><BR><BR>The others applauded what Antinous had said, and each one sent 
<A NAME="237"></A>his servant to bring his present. Antinous's man returned with a large 
<A NAME="238"></A>and lovely dress most exquisitely embroidered. It had twelve beautifully 
<A NAME="239"></A>made brooch pins of pure gold with which to fasten it. Eurymachus immediately 
<A NAME="240"></A>brought her a magnificent chain of gold and amber beads that gleamed like 
<A NAME="241"></A>sunlight. Eurydamas's two men returned with some earrings fashioned into 
<A NAME="242"></A>three brilliant pendants which glistened most beautifully; while king Pisander 
<A NAME="243"></A>son of Polyctor gave her a necklace of the rarest workmanship, and every 
<A NAME="244"></A>one else brought her a beautiful present of some kind.
<A NAME="245"></A><BR><BR>Then the queen went back to her room upstairs, and her maids brought 
<A NAME="246"></A>the presents after her. Meanwhile the suitors took to singing and dancing, 
<A NAME="247"></A>and stayed till evening came. They danced and sang till it grew dark; they 
<A NAME="248"></A>then brought in three braziers to give light, and piled them up with chopped 
<A NAME="249"></A>firewood very and dry, and they lit torches from them, which the maids 
<A NAME="250"></A>held up turn and turn about. Then Ulysses said:
<A NAME="251"></A><BR><BR>"Maids, servants of Ulysses who has so long been absent, go to 
<A NAME="252"></A>the queen inside the house; sit with her and amuse her, or spin, and pick 
<A NAME="253"></A>wool. I will hold the light for all these people. They may stay till morning, 
<A NAME="254"></A>but shall not beat me, for I can stand a great deal."
<A NAME="255"></A><BR><BR>The maids looked at one another and laughed, while pretty Melantho 
<A NAME="256"></A>began to gibe at him contemptuously. She was daughter to Dolius, but had 
<A NAME="257"></A>been brought up by Penelope, who used to give her toys to play with, and 
<A NAME="258"></A>looked after her when she was a child; but in spite of all this she showed 
<A NAME="259"></A>no consideration for the sorrows of her mistress, and used to misconduct 
<A NAME="260"></A>herself with Eurymachus, with whom she was in love.
<A NAME="261"></A><BR><BR>"Poor wretch," said she, "are you gone clean out of your mind? 
<A NAME="262"></A>Go and sleep in some smithy, or place of public gossips, instead of chattering 
<A NAME="263"></A>here. Are you not ashamed of opening your mouth before your betters- so 
<A NAME="264"></A>many of them too? Has the wine been getting into your head, or do you always 
<A NAME="265"></A>babble in this way? You seem to have lost your wits because you beat the 
<A NAME="266"></A>tramp Irus; take care that a better man than he does not come and cudgel 
<A NAME="267"></A>you about the head till he pack you bleeding out of the 
<A NAME="268"></A>house."
<A NAME="269"></A><BR><BR>"Vixen," replied Ulysses, scowling at her, "I will go and tell 
<A NAME="270"></A>Telemachus what you have been saying, and he will have you torn limb from 
<A NAME="271"></A>limb."
<A NAME="272"></A><BR><BR>With these words he scared the women, and they went off into the 
<A NAME="273"></A>body of the house. They trembled all aver, for they thought he would do 
<A NAME="274"></A>as he said. But Ulysses took his stand near the burning braziers, holding 
<A NAME="275"></A>up torches and looking at the people- brooding the while on things that 
<A NAME="276"></A>should surely come to pass.
<A NAME="277"></A><BR><BR>But Minerva would not let the suitors for one moment cease their 
<A NAME="278"></A>insolence, for she wanted Ulysses to become even more bitter against them; 
<A NAME="279"></A>she therefore set Eurymachus son of Polybus on to gibe at him, which made 
<A NAME="280"></A>the others laugh. "Listen to me," said he, "you suitors of Queen Penelope, 
<A NAME="281"></A>that I may speak even as I am minded. It is not for nothing that this man 
<A NAME="282"></A>has come to the house of Ulysses; I believe the light has not been coming 
<A NAME="283"></A>from the torches, but from his own head- for his hair is all gone, every 
<A NAME="284"></A>bit of it."
<A NAME="285"></A><BR><BR>Then turning to Ulysses he said, "Stranger, will you work as a 
<A NAME="286"></A>servant, if I send you to the wolds and see that you are well paid? Can 
<A NAME="287"></A>you build a stone fence, or plant trees? I will have you fed all the year 
<A NAME="288"></A>round, and will find you in shoes and clothing. Will you go, then? Not 
<A NAME="289"></A>you; for you have got into bad ways, and do not want to work; you had rather 
<A NAME="290"></A>fill your belly by going round the country begging."
<A NAME="291"></A><BR><BR>"Eurymachus," answered Ulysses, "if you and I were to work one 
<A NAME="292"></A>against the other in early summer when the days are at their longest- give 
<A NAME="293"></A>me a good scythe, and take another yourself, and let us see which will 
<A NAME="294"></A>fast the longer or mow the stronger, from dawn till dark when the mowing 
<A NAME="295"></A>grass is about. Or if you will plough against me, let us each take a yoke 
<A NAME="296"></A>of tawny oxen, well-mated and of great strength and endurance: turn me 
<A NAME="297"></A>into a four acre field, and see whether you or I can drive the straighter 
<A NAME="298"></A>furrow. If, again, war were to break out this day, give me a shield, a 
<A NAME="299"></A>couple of spears and a helmet fitting well upon my temples- you would find 
<A NAME="300"></A>me foremost in the fray, and would cease your gibes about my belly. You 
<A NAME="301"></A>are insolent and cruel, and think yourself a great man because you live 
<A NAME="302"></A>in a little world, ind that a bad one. If Ulysses comes to his own again, 
<A NAME="303"></A>the doors of his house are wide, but you will find them narrow when you 
<A NAME="304"></A>try to fly through them."
<A NAME="305"></A><BR><BR>Eurymachus was furious at all this. He scowled at him and cried, 
<A NAME="306"></A>"You wretch, I will soon pay you out for daring to say such things to me, 
<A NAME="307"></A>and in public too. Has the wine been getting into your head or do you always 
<A NAME="308"></A>babble in this way? You seem to have lost your wits because you beat the 
<A NAME="309"></A>tramp Irus. With this he caught hold of a footstool, but Ulysses sought 
<A NAME="310"></A>protection at the knees of Amphinomus of Dulichium, for he was afraid. 
<A NAME="311"></A>The stool hit the cupbearer on his right hand and knocked him down: the 
<A NAME="312"></A>man fell with a cry flat on his back, and his wine-jug fell ringing to 
<A NAME="313"></A>the ground. The suitors in the covered cloister were now in an uproar, 
<A NAME="314"></A>and one would turn towards his neighbour, saying, "I wish the stranger 
<A NAME="315"></A>had gone somewhere else, bad luck to hide, for all the trouble he gives 
<A NAME="316"></A>us. We cannot permit such disturbance about a beggar; if such ill counsels 
<A NAME="317"></A>are to prevail we shall have no more pleasure at our 
<A NAME="318"></A>banquet."
<A NAME="319"></A><BR><BR>On this Telemachus came forward and said, "Sirs, are you mad? Can 
<A NAME="320"></A>you not carry your meat and your liquor decently? Some evil spirit has 
<A NAME="321"></A>possessed you. I do not wish to drive any of you away, but you have had 
<A NAME="322"></A>your suppers, and the sooner you all go home to bed the 
<A NAME="323"></A>better."
<A NAME="324"></A><BR><BR>The suitors bit their lips and marvelled at the boldness of his 
<A NAME="325"></A>speech; but Amphinomus the son of Nisus, who was son to Aretias, said, 
<A NAME="326"></A>"Do not let us take offence; it is reasonable, so let us make no answer. 
<A NAME="327"></A>Neither let us do violence to the stranger nor to any of Ulysses' servants. 
<A NAME="328"></A>Let the cupbearer go round with the drink-offerings, that we may make them 
<A NAME="329"></A>and go home to our rest. As for the stranger, let us leave Telemachus to 
<A NAME="330"></A>deal with him, for it is to his house that he has come."
<A NAME="331"></A><BR><BR>Thus did he speak, and his saying pleased them well, so Mulius 
<A NAME="332"></A>of Dulichium, servant to Amphinomus, mixed them a bowl of wine and water 
<A NAME="333"></A>and handed it round to each of them man by man, whereon they made their 
<A NAME="334"></A>drink-offerings to the blessed gods: Then, when they had made their drink-offerings 
<A NAME="335"></A>and had drunk each one as he was minded, they took their several ways each 
<A NAME="336"></A>of them to his own abode.
