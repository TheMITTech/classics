<A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A>Then, when we had got down to the sea shore we drew our ship into the water 
<A NAME="11"></A>and got her mast and sails into her; we also put the sheep on board and 
<A NAME="12"></A>took our places, weeping and in great distress of mind. Circe, that great 
<A NAME="13"></A>and cunning goddess, sent us a fair wind that blew dead aft and stayed 
<A NAME="14"></A>steadily with us keeping our sails all the time well filled; so we did 
<A NAME="15"></A>whatever wanted doing to the ship's gear and let her go as the wind and 
<A NAME="16"></A>helmsman headed her. All day long her sails were full as she held her course 
<A NAME="17"></A>over the sea, but when the sun went down and darkness was over all the 
<A NAME="18"></A>earth, we got into the deep waters of the river Oceanus, where lie the 
<A NAME="19"></A>land and city of the Cimmerians who live enshrouded in mist and darkness 
<A NAME="20"></A>which the rays of the sun never pierce neither at his rising nor as he 
<A NAME="21"></A>goes down again out of the heavens, but the poor wretches live in one long 
<A NAME="22"></A>melancholy night. When we got there we beached the ship, took the sheep 
<A NAME="23"></A>out of her, and went along by the waters of Oceanus till we came to the 
<A NAME="24"></A>place of which Circe had told us.
<A NAME="25"></A><BR><BR>"Here Perimedes and Eurylochus held the victims, while I drew my 
<A NAME="26"></A>sword and dug the trench a cubit each way. I made a drink-offering to all 
<A NAME="27"></A>the dead, first with honey and milk, then with wine, and thirdly with water, 
<A NAME="28"></A>and I sprinkled white barley meal over the whole, praying earnestly to 
<A NAME="29"></A>the poor feckless ghosts, and promising them that when I got back to Ithaca 
<A NAME="30"></A>I would sacrifice a barren heifer for them, the best I had, and would load 
<A NAME="31"></A>the pyre with good things. I also particularly promised that Teiresias 
<A NAME="32"></A>should have a black sheep to himself, the best in all my flocks. When I 
<A NAME="33"></A>had prayed sufficiently to the dead, I cut the throats of the two sheep 
<A NAME="34"></A>and let the blood run into the trench, whereon the ghosts came trooping 
<A NAME="35"></A>up from Erebus- brides, young bachelors, old men worn out with toil, maids 
<A NAME="36"></A>who had been crossed in love, and brave men who had been killed in battle, 
<A NAME="37"></A>with their armour still smirched with blood; they came from every quarter 
<A NAME="38"></A>and flitted round the trench with a strange kind of screaming sound that 
<A NAME="39"></A>made me turn pale with fear. When I saw them coming I told the men to be 
<A NAME="40"></A>quick and flay the carcasses of the two dead sheep and make burnt offerings 
<A NAME="41"></A>of them, and at the same time to repeat prayers to Hades and to Proserpine; 
<A NAME="42"></A>but I sat where I was with my sword drawn and would not let the poor feckless 
<A NAME="43"></A>ghosts come near the blood till Teiresias should have answered my 
<A NAME="44"></A>questions.
<A NAME="45"></A><BR><BR>"The first ghost 'that came was that of my comrade Elpenor, for 
<A NAME="46"></A>he had not yet been laid beneath the earth. We had left his body unwaked 
<A NAME="47"></A>and unburied in Circe's house, for we had had too much else to do. I was 
<A NAME="48"></A>very sorry for him, and cried when I saw him: 'Elpenor,' said I, 'how did 
<A NAME="49"></A>you come down here into this gloom and darkness? You have here on foot 
<A NAME="50"></A>quicker than I have with my ship.'
<A NAME="51"></A><BR><BR>"'Sir,' he answered with a groan, 'it was all bad luck, and my 
<A NAME="52"></A>own unspeakable drunkenness. I was lying asleep on the top of Circe's house, 
<A NAME="53"></A>and never thought of coming down again by the great staircase but fell 
<A NAME="54"></A>right off the roof and broke my neck, so my soul down to the house of Hades. 
<A NAME="55"></A>And now I beseech you by all those whom you have left behind you, though 
<A NAME="56"></A>they are not here, by your wife, by the father who brought you up when 
<A NAME="57"></A>you were a child, and by Telemachus who is the one hope of your house, 
<A NAME="58"></A>do what I shall now ask you. I know that when you leave this limbo you 
<A NAME="59"></A>will again hold your ship for the Aeaean island. Do not go thence leaving 
<A NAME="60"></A>me unwaked and unburied behind you, or I may bring heaven's anger upon 
<A NAME="61"></A>you; but burn me with whatever armour I have, build a barrow for me on 
<A NAME="62"></A>the sea shore, that may tell people in days to come what a poor unlucky 
<A NAME="63"></A>fellow I was, and plant over my grave the oar I used to row with when I 
<A NAME="64"></A>was yet alive and with my messmates.' And I said, 'My poor fellow, I will 
<A NAME="65"></A>do all that you have asked of me.'
<A NAME="66"></A><BR><BR>"Thus, then, did we sit and hold sad talk with one another, I on 
<A NAME="67"></A>the one side of the trench with my sword held over the blood, and the ghost 
<A NAME="68"></A>of my comrade saying all this to me from the other side. Then came the 
<A NAME="69"></A>ghost of my dead mother Anticlea, daughter to Autolycus. I had left her 
<A NAME="70"></A>alive when I set out for Troy and was moved to tears when I saw her, but 
<A NAME="71"></A>even so, for all my sorrow I would not let her come near the blood till 
<A NAME="72"></A>I had asked my questions of Teiresias.
<A NAME="73"></A><BR><BR>"Then came also the ghost of Theban Teiresias, with his golden 
<A NAME="74"></A>sceptre in his hand. He knew me and said, 'Ulysses, noble son of Laertes, 
<A NAME="75"></A>why, poor man, have you left the light of day and come down to visit the 
<A NAME="76"></A>dead in this sad place? Stand back from the trench and withdraw your sword 
<A NAME="77"></A>that I may drink of the blood and answer your questions 
<A NAME="78"></A>truly.'
<A NAME="79"></A><BR><BR>"So I drew back, and sheathed my sword, whereon when he had drank 
<A NAME="80"></A>of the blood he began with his prophecy.
<A NAME="81"></A><BR><BR>"You want to know,' said he, 'about your return home, but heaven 
<A NAME="82"></A>will make this hard for you. I do not think that you will escape the eye 
<A NAME="83"></A>of Neptune, who still nurses his bitter grudge against you for having blinded 
<A NAME="84"></A>his son. Still, after much suffering you may get home if you can restrain 
<A NAME="85"></A>yourself and your companions when your ship reaches the Thrinacian island, 
<A NAME="86"></A>where you will find the sheep and cattle belonging to the sun, who sees 
<A NAME="87"></A>and gives ear to everything. If you leave these flocks unharmed and think 
<A NAME="88"></A>of nothing but of getting home, you may yet after much hardship reach Ithaca; 
<A NAME="89"></A>but if you harm them, then I forewarn you of the destruction both of your 
<A NAME="90"></A>ship and of your men. Even though you may yourself escape, you will return 
<A NAME="91"></A>in bad plight after losing all your men, [in another man's ship, and you 
<A NAME="92"></A>will find trouble in your house, which will be overrun by high-handed people, 
<A NAME="93"></A>who are devouring your substance under the pretext of paying court and 
<A NAME="94"></A>making presents to your wife.
<A NAME="95"></A><BR><BR>"'When you get home you will take your revenge on these suitors; 
<A NAME="96"></A>and after you have killed them by force or fraud in your own house, you 
<A NAME="97"></A>must take a well-made oar and carry it on and on, till you come to a country 
<A NAME="98"></A>where the people have never heard of the sea and do not even mix salt with 
<A NAME="99"></A>their food, nor do they know anything about ships, and oars that are as 
<A NAME="100"></A>the wings of a ship. I will give you this certain token which cannot escape 
<A NAME="101"></A>your notice. A wayfarer will meet you and will say it must be a winnowing 
<A NAME="102"></A>shovel that you have got upon your shoulder; on this you must fix the oar 
<A NAME="103"></A>in the ground and sacrifice a ram, a bull, and a boar to Neptune. Then 
<A NAME="104"></A>go home and offer hecatombs to an the gods in heaven one after the other. 
<A NAME="105"></A>As for yourself, death shall come to you from the sea, and your life shall 
<A NAME="106"></A>ebb away very gently when you are full of years and peace of mind, and 
<A NAME="107"></A>your people shall bless you. All that I have said will come 
<A NAME="108"></A>true].'
<A NAME="109"></A><BR><BR>"'This,' I answered, 'must be as it may please heaven, but tell 
<A NAME="110"></A>me and tell me and tell me true, I see my poor mother's ghost close by 
<A NAME="111"></A>us; she is sitting by the blood without saying a word, and though I am 
<A NAME="112"></A>her own son she does not remember me and speak to me; tell me, Sir, how 
<A NAME="113"></A>I can make her know me.'
<A NAME="114"></A><BR><BR>"'That,' said he, 'I can soon do Any ghost that you let taste of 
<A NAME="115"></A>the blood will talk with you like a reasonable being, but if you do not 
<A NAME="116"></A>let them have any blood they will go away again.'
<A NAME="117"></A><BR><BR>"On this the ghost of Teiresias went back to the house of Hades, 
<A NAME="118"></A>for his prophecyings had now been spoken, but I sat still where I was until 
<A NAME="119"></A>my mother came up and tasted the blood. Then she knew me at once and spoke 
<A NAME="120"></A>fondly to me, saying, 'My son, how did you come down to this abode of darkness 
<A NAME="121"></A>while you are still alive? It is a hard thing for the living to see these 
<A NAME="122"></A>places, for between us and them there are great and terrible waters, and 
<A NAME="123"></A>there is Oceanus, which no man can cross on foot, but he must have a good 
<A NAME="124"></A>ship to take him. Are you all this time trying to find your way home from 
<A NAME="125"></A>Troy, and have you never yet got back to Ithaca nor seen your wife in your 
<A NAME="126"></A>own house?'
<A NAME="127"></A><BR><BR>"'Mother,' said I, 'I was forced to come here to consult the ghost 
<A NAME="128"></A>of the Theban prophet Teiresias. I have never yet been near the Achaean 
<A NAME="129"></A>land nor set foot on my native country, and I have had nothing but one 
<A NAME="130"></A>long series of misfortunes from the very first day that I set out with 
<A NAME="131"></A>Agamemnon for Ilius, the land of noble steeds, to fight the Trojans. But 
<A NAME="132"></A>tell me, and tell me true, in what way did you die? Did you have a long 
<A NAME="133"></A>illness, or did heaven vouchsafe you a gentle easy passage to eternity? 
<A NAME="134"></A>Tell me also about my father, and the son whom I left behind me; is my 
<A NAME="135"></A>property still in their hands, or has some one else got hold of it, who 
<A NAME="136"></A>thinks that I shall not return to claim it? Tell me again what my wife 
<A NAME="137"></A>intends doing, and in what mind she is; does she live with my son and guard 
<A NAME="138"></A>my estate securely, or has she made the best match she could and married 
<A NAME="139"></A>again?'
<A NAME="140"></A><BR><BR>"My mother answered, 'Your wife still remains in your house, but 
<A NAME="141"></A>she is in great distress of mind and spends her whole time in tears both 
<A NAME="142"></A>night and day. No one as yet has got possession of your fine property, 
<A NAME="143"></A>and Telemachus still holds your lands undisturbed. He has to entertain 
<A NAME="144"></A>largely, as of course he must, considering his position as a magistrate, 
<A NAME="145"></A>and how every one invites him; your father remains at his old place in 
<A NAME="146"></A>the country and never goes near the town. He has no comfortable bed nor 
<A NAME="147"></A>bedding; in the winter he sleeps on the floor in front of the fire with 
<A NAME="148"></A>the men and goes about all in rags, but in summer, when the warm weather 
<A NAME="149"></A>comes on again, he lies out in the vineyard on a bed of vine leaves thrown 
<A NAME="150"></A>anyhow upon the ground. He grieves continually about your never having 
<A NAME="151"></A>come home, and suffers more and more as he grows older. As for my own end 
<A NAME="152"></A>it was in this wise: heaven did not take me swiftly and painlessly in my 
<A NAME="153"></A>own house, nor was I attacked by any illness such as those that generally 
<A NAME="154"></A>wear people out and kill them, but my longing to know what you were doing 
<A NAME="155"></A>and the force of my affection for you- this it was that was the death of 
<A NAME="156"></A>me.'
<A NAME="157"></A><BR><BR>"Then I tried to find some way of embracing my mother's ghost. 
<A NAME="158"></A>Thrice I sprang towards her and tried to clasp her in my arms, but each 
<A NAME="159"></A>time she flitted from my embrace as it were a dream or phantom, and being 
<A NAME="160"></A>touched to the quick I said to her, 'Mother, why do you not stay still 
<A NAME="161"></A>when I would embrace you? If we could throw our arms around one another 
<A NAME="162"></A>we might find sad comfort in the sharing of our sorrows even in the house 
<A NAME="163"></A>of Hades; does Proserpine want to lay a still further load of grief upon 
<A NAME="164"></A>me by mocking me with a phantom only?'
<A NAME="165"></A><BR><BR>"'My son,' she answered, 'most ill-fated of all mankind, it is 
<A NAME="166"></A>not Proserpine that is beguiling you, but all people are like this when 
<A NAME="167"></A>they are dead. The sinews no longer hold the flesh and bones together; 
<A NAME="168"></A>these perish in the fierceness of consuming fire as soon as life has left 
<A NAME="169"></A>the body, and the soul flits away as though it were a dream. Now, however, 
<A NAME="170"></A>go back to the light of day as soon as you can, and note all these things 
<A NAME="171"></A>that you may tell them to your wife hereafter.'
<A NAME="172"></A><BR><BR>"Thus did we converse, and anon Proserpine sent up the ghosts of 
<A NAME="173"></A>the wives and daughters of all the most famous men. They gathered in crowds 
<A NAME="174"></A>about the blood, and I considered how I might question them severally. 
<A NAME="175"></A>In the end I deemed that it would be best to draw the keen blade that hung 
<A NAME="176"></A>by my sturdy thigh, and keep them from all drinking the blood at once. 
<A NAME="177"></A>So they came up one after the other, and each one as I questioned her told 
<A NAME="178"></A>me her race and lineage.
<A NAME="179"></A><BR><BR>"The first I saw was Tyro. She was daughter of Salmoneus and wife 
<A NAME="180"></A>of Cretheus the son of Aeolus. She fell in love with the river Enipeus 
<A NAME="181"></A>who is much the most beautiful river in the whole world. Once when she 
<A NAME="182"></A>was taking a walk by his side as usual, Neptune, disguised as her lover, 
<A NAME="183"></A>lay with her at the mouth of the river, and a huge blue wave arched itself 
<A NAME="184"></A>like a mountain over them to hide both woman and god, whereon he loosed 
<A NAME="185"></A>her virgin girdle and laid her in a deep slumber. When the god had accomplished 
<A NAME="186"></A>the deed of love, he took her hand in his own and said, 'Tyro, rejoice 
<A NAME="187"></A>in all good will; the embraces of the gods are not fruitless, and you will 
<A NAME="188"></A>have fine twins about this time twelve months. Take great care of them. 
<A NAME="189"></A>I am Neptune, so now go home, but hold your tongue and do not tell any 
<A NAME="190"></A>one.'
<A NAME="191"></A><BR><BR>"Then he dived under the sea, and she in due course bore Pelias 
<A NAME="192"></A>and Neleus, who both of them served Jove with all their might. Pelias was 
<A NAME="193"></A>a great breeder of sheep and lived in Iolcus, but the other lived in Pylos. 
<A NAME="194"></A>The rest of her children were by Cretheus, namely, Aeson, Pheres, and Amythaon, 
<A NAME="195"></A>who was a mighty warrior and charioteer.
<A NAME="196"></A><BR><BR>"Next to her I saw Antiope, daughter to Asopus, who could boast 
<A NAME="197"></A>of having slept in the arms of even Jove himself, and who bore him two 
<A NAME="198"></A>sons Amphion and Zethus. These founded Thebes with its seven gates, and 
<A NAME="199"></A>built a wall all round it; for strong though they were they could not hold 
<A NAME="200"></A>Thebes till they had walled it.
<A NAME="201"></A><BR><BR>"Then I saw Alcmena, the wife of Amphitryon, who also bore to Jove 
<A NAME="202"></A>indomitable Hercules; and Megara who was daughter to great King Creon, 
<A NAME="203"></A>and married the redoubtable son of Amphitryon.
<A NAME="204"></A><BR><BR>"I also saw fair Epicaste mother of king OEdipodes whose awful 
<A NAME="205"></A>lot it was to marry her own son without suspecting it. He married her after 
<A NAME="206"></A>having killed his father, but the gods proclaimed the whole story to the 
<A NAME="207"></A>world; whereon he remained king of Thebes, in great grief for the spite 
<A NAME="208"></A>the gods had borne him; but Epicaste went to the house of the mighty jailor 
<A NAME="209"></A>Hades, having hanged herself for grief, and the avenging spirits haunted 
<A NAME="210"></A>him as for an outraged mother- to his ruing bitterly 
<A NAME="211"></A>thereafter.
<A NAME="212"></A><BR><BR>"Then I saw Chloris, whom Neleus married for her beauty, having 
<A NAME="213"></A>given priceless presents for her. She was youngest daughter to Amphion 
<A NAME="214"></A>son of Iasus and king of Minyan Orchomenus, and was Queen in Pylos. She 
<A NAME="215"></A>bore Nestor, Chromius, and Periclymenus, and she also bore that marvellously 
<A NAME="216"></A>lovely woman Pero, who was wooed by all the country round; but Neleus would 
<A NAME="217"></A>only give her to him who should raid the cattle of Iphicles from the grazing 
<A NAME="218"></A>grounds of Phylace, and this was a hard task. The only man who would undertake 
<A NAME="219"></A>to raid them was a certain excellent seer, but the will of heaven was against 
<A NAME="220"></A>him, for the rangers of the cattle caught him and put him in prison; nevertheless 
<A NAME="221"></A>when a full year had passed and the same season came round again, Iphicles 
<A NAME="222"></A>set him at liberty, after he had expounded all the oracles of heaven. Thus, 
<A NAME="223"></A>then, was the will of Jove accomplished.
<A NAME="224"></A><BR><BR>"And I saw Leda the wife of Tyndarus, who bore him two famous sons, 
<A NAME="225"></A>Castor breaker of horses, and Pollux the mighty boxer. Both these heroes 
<A NAME="226"></A>are lying under the earth, though they are still alive, for by a special 
<A NAME="227"></A>dispensation of Jove, they die and come to life again, each one of them 
<A NAME="228"></A>every other day throughout all time, and they have the rank of 
<A NAME="229"></A>gods.
<A NAME="230"></A><BR><BR>"After her I saw Iphimedeia wife of Aloeus who boasted the embrace 
<A NAME="231"></A>of Neptune. She bore two sons Otus and Ephialtes, but both were short lived. 
<A NAME="232"></A>They were the finest children that were ever born in this world, and the 
<A NAME="233"></A>best looking, Orion only excepted; for at nine years old they were nine 
<A NAME="234"></A>fathoms high, and measured nine cubits round the chest. They threatened 
<A NAME="235"></A>to make war with the gods in Olympus, and tried to set Mount Ossa on the 
<A NAME="236"></A>top of Mount Olympus, and Mount Pelion on the top of Ossa, that they might 
<A NAME="237"></A>scale heaven itself, and they would have done it too if they had been grown 
<A NAME="238"></A>up, but Apollo, son of Leto, killed both of them, before they had got so 
<A NAME="239"></A>much as a sign of hair upon their cheeks or chin.
<A NAME="240"></A><BR><BR>"Then I saw Phaedra, and Procris, and fair Ariadne daughter of 
<A NAME="241"></A>the magician Minos, whom Theseus was carrying off from Crete to Athens, 
<A NAME="242"></A>but he did not enjoy her, for before he could do so Diana killed her in 
<A NAME="243"></A>the island of Dia on account of what Bacchus had said against 
<A NAME="244"></A>her.
<A NAME="245"></A><BR><BR>"I also saw Maera and Clymene and hateful Eriphyle, who sold her 
<A NAME="246"></A>own husband for gold. But it would take me all night if I were to name 
<A NAME="247"></A>every single one of the wives and daughters of heroes whom I saw, and it 
<A NAME="248"></A>is time for me to go to bed, either on board ship with my crew, or here. 
<A NAME="249"></A>As for my escort, heaven and yourselves will see to 
<A NAME="250"></A>it."
<A NAME="251"></A><BR><BR>Here he ended, and the guests sat all of them enthralled and speechless 
<A NAME="252"></A>throughout the covered cloister. Then Arete said to 
<A NAME="253"></A>them:
<A NAME="254"></A><BR><BR>"What do you think of this man, O Phaecians? Is he not tall and 
<A NAME="255"></A>good looking, and is he not Clever? True, he is my own guest, but all of 
<A NAME="256"></A>you share in the distinction. Do not he a hurry to send him away, nor niggardly 
<A NAME="257"></A>in the presents you make to one who is in such great need, for heaven has 
<A NAME="258"></A>blessed all of you with great abundance."
<A NAME="259"></A><BR><BR>Then spoke the aged hero Echeneus who was one of the oldest men 
<A NAME="260"></A>among them, "My friends," said he, "what our august queen has just said 
<A NAME="261"></A>to us is both reasonable and to the purpose, therefore be persuaded by 
<A NAME="262"></A>it; but the decision whether in word or deed rests ultimately with King 
<A NAME="263"></A>Alcinous."
<A NAME="264"></A><BR><BR>"The thing shall be done," exclaimed Alcinous, "as surely as I 
<A NAME="265"></A>still live and reign over the Phaeacians. Our guest is indeed very anxious 
<A NAME="266"></A>to get home, still we must persuade him to remain with us until to-morrow, 
<A NAME="267"></A>by which time I shall be able to get together the whole sum that I mean 
<A NAME="268"></A>to give him. As regards- his escort it will be a matter for you all, and 
<A NAME="269"></A>mine above all others as the chief person among you."
<A NAME="270"></A><BR><BR>And Ulysses answered, "King Alcinous, if you were to bid me to 
<A NAME="271"></A>stay here for a whole twelve months, and then speed me on my way, loaded 
<A NAME="272"></A>with your noble gifts, I should obey you gladly and it would redound greatly 
<A NAME="273"></A>to my advantage, for I should return fuller-handed to my own people, and 
<A NAME="274"></A>should thus be more respected and beloved by all who see me when I get 
<A NAME="275"></A>back to Ithaca."
<A NAME="276"></A><BR><BR>"Ulysses," replied Alcinous, "not one of us who sees you has any 
<A NAME="277"></A>idea that you are a charlatan or a swindler. I know there are many people 
<A NAME="278"></A>going about who tell such plausible stories that it is very hard to see 
<A NAME="279"></A>through them, but there is a style about your language which assures me 
<A NAME="280"></A>of your good disposition. Moreover you have told the story of your own 
<A NAME="281"></A>misfortunes, and those of the Argives, as though you were a practised bard; 
<A NAME="282"></A>but tell me, and tell me true, whether you saw any of the mighty heroes 
<A NAME="283"></A>who went to Troy at the same time with yourself, and perished there. The 
<A NAME="284"></A>evenings are still at their longest, and it is not yet bed time- go on, 
<A NAME="285"></A>therefore, with your divine story, for I could stay here listening till 
<A NAME="286"></A>to-morrow morning, so long as you will continue to tell us of your 
<A NAME="287"></A>adventures."
<A NAME="288"></A><BR><BR>"Alcinous," answered Ulysses, "there is a time for making speeches, 
<A NAME="289"></A>and a time for going to bed; nevertheless, since you so desire, I will 
<A NAME="290"></A>not refrain from telling you the still sadder tale of those of my comrades 
<A NAME="291"></A>who did not fall fighting with the Trojans, but perished on their return, 
<A NAME="292"></A>through the treachery of a wicked woman.
<A NAME="293"></A><BR><BR>"When Proserpine had dismissed the female ghosts in all directions, 
<A NAME="294"></A>the ghost of Agamemnon son of Atreus came sadly up tome, surrounded by 
<A NAME="295"></A>those who had perished with him in the house of Aegisthus. As soon as he 
<A NAME="296"></A>had tasted the blood he knew me, and weeping bitterly stretched out his 
<A NAME="297"></A>arms towards me to embrace me; but he had no strength nor substance any 
<A NAME="298"></A>more, and I too wept and pitied him as I beheld him. 'How did you come 
<A NAME="299"></A>by your death,' said I, 'King Agamemnon? Did Neptune raise his winds and 
<A NAME="300"></A>waves against you when you were at sea, or did your enemies make an end 
<A NAME="301"></A>of you on the mainland when you were cattle-lifting or sheep-stealing, 
<A NAME="302"></A>or while they were fighting in defence of their wives and 
<A NAME="303"></A>city?'
<A NAME="304"></A><BR><BR>"'Ulysses,' he answered, 'noble son of Laertes, was not lost at 
<A NAME="305"></A>sea in any storm of Neptune's raising, nor did my foes despatch me upon 
<A NAME="306"></A>the mainland, but Aegisthus and my wicked wife were the death of me between 
<A NAME="307"></A>them. He asked me to his house, feasted me, and then butchered me most 
<A NAME="308"></A>miserably as though I were a fat beast in a slaughter house, while all 
<A NAME="309"></A>around me my comrades were slain like sheep or pigs for the wedding breakfast, 
<A NAME="310"></A>or picnic, or gorgeous banquet of some great nobleman. You must have seen 
<A NAME="311"></A>numbers of men killed either in a general engagement, or in single combat, 
<A NAME="312"></A>but you never saw anything so truly pitiable as the way in which we fell 
<A NAME="313"></A>in that cloister, with the mixing-bowl and the loaded tables lying all 
<A NAME="314"></A>about, and the ground reeking with our-blood. I heard Priam's daughter 
<A NAME="315"></A>Cassandra scream as Clytemnestra killed her close beside me. I lay dying 
<A NAME="316"></A>upon the earth with the sword in my body, and raised my hands to kill the 
<A NAME="317"></A>slut of a murderess, but she slipped away from me; she would not even close 
<A NAME="318"></A>my lips nor my eyes when I was dying, for there is nothing in this world 
<A NAME="319"></A>so cruel and so shameless as a woman when she has fallen into such guilt 
<A NAME="320"></A>as hers was. Fancy murdering her own husband! I thought I was going to 
<A NAME="321"></A>be welcomed home by my children and my servants, but her abominable crime 
<A NAME="322"></A>has brought disgrace on herself and all women who shall come after- even 
<A NAME="323"></A>on the good ones.'
<A NAME="324"></A><BR><BR>"And I said, 'In truth Jove has hated the house of Atreus from 
<A NAME="325"></A>first to last in the matter of their women's counsels. See how many of 
<A NAME="326"></A>us fell for Helen's sake, and now it seems that Clytemnestra hatched mischief 
<A NAME="327"></A>against too during your absence.'
<A NAME="328"></A><BR><BR>"'Be sure, therefore,' continued Agamemnon, 'and not be too friendly 
<A NAME="329"></A>even with your own wife. Do not tell her all that you know perfectly well 
<A NAME="330"></A>yourself. Tell her a part only, and keep your own counsel about the rest. 
<A NAME="331"></A>Not that your wife, Ulysses, is likely to murder you, for Penelope is a 
<A NAME="332"></A>very admirable woman, and has an excellent nature. We left her a young 
<A NAME="333"></A>bride with an infant at her breast when we set out for Troy. This child 
<A NAME="334"></A>no doubt is now grown up happily to man's estate, and he and his father 
<A NAME="335"></A>will have a joyful meeting and embrace one another as it is right they 
<A NAME="336"></A>should do, whereas my wicked wife did not even allow me the happiness of 
<A NAME="337"></A>looking upon my son, but killed me ere I could do so. Furthermore I say- 
<A NAME="338"></A>and lay my saying to your heart- do not tell people when you are bringing 
<A NAME="339"></A>your ship to Ithaca, but steal a march upon them, for after all this there 
<A NAME="340"></A>is no trusting women. But now tell me, and tell me true, can you give me 
<A NAME="341"></A>any news of my son Orestes? Is he in Orchomenus, or at Pylos, or is he 
<A NAME="342"></A>at Sparta with Menelaus- for I presume that he is still 
<A NAME="343"></A>living.'
<A NAME="344"></A><BR><BR>"And I said, 'Agamemnon, why do you ask me? I do not know whether 
<A NAME="345"></A>your son is alive or dead, and it is not right to talk when one does not 
<A NAME="346"></A>know.'
<A NAME="347"></A><BR><BR>"As we two sat weeping and talking thus sadly with one another 
<A NAME="348"></A>the ghost of Achilles came up to us with Patroclus, Antilochus, and Ajax 
<A NAME="349"></A>who was the finest and goodliest man of all the Danaans after the son of 
<A NAME="350"></A>Peleus. The fleet descendant of Aeacus knew me and spoke piteously, saying, 
<A NAME="351"></A>'Ulysses, noble son of Laertes, what deed of daring will you undertake 
<A NAME="352"></A>next, that you venture down to the house of Hades among us silly dead, 
<A NAME="353"></A>who are but the ghosts of them that can labour no more?'
<A NAME="354"></A><BR><BR>"And I said, 'Achilles, son of Peleus, foremost champion of the 
<A NAME="355"></A>Achaeans, I came to consult Teiresias, and see if he could advise me about 
<A NAME="356"></A>my return home to Ithaca, for I have never yet been able to get near the 
<A NAME="357"></A>Achaean land, nor to set foot in my own country, but have been in trouble 
<A NAME="358"></A>all the time. As for you, Achilles, no one was ever yet so fortunate as 
<A NAME="359"></A>you have been, nor ever will be, for you were adored by all us Argives 
<A NAME="360"></A>as long as you were alive, and now that you are here you are a great prince 
<A NAME="361"></A>among the dead. Do not, therefore, take it so much to heart even if you 
<A NAME="362"></A>are dead.'
<A NAME="363"></A><BR><BR>"'Say not a word,' he answered, 'in death's favour; I would rather 
<A NAME="364"></A>be a paid servant in a poor man's house and be above ground than king of 
<A NAME="365"></A>kings among the dead. But give me news about son; is he gone to the wars 
<A NAME="366"></A>and will he be a great soldier, or is this not so? Tell me also if you 
<A NAME="367"></A>have heard anything about my father Peleus- does he still rule among the 
<A NAME="368"></A>Myrmidons, or do they show him no respect throughout Hellas and Phthia 
<A NAME="369"></A>now that he is old and his limbs fail him? Could I but stand by his side, 
<A NAME="370"></A>in the light of day, with the same strength that I had when I killed the 
<A NAME="371"></A>bravest of our foes upon the plain of Troy- could I but be as I then was 
<A NAME="372"></A>and go even for a short time to my father's house, any one who tried to 
<A NAME="373"></A>do him violence or supersede him would soon me it.'
<A NAME="374"></A><BR><BR>"'I have heard nothing,' I answered, 'of Peleus, but I can tell 
<A NAME="375"></A>you all about your son Neoptolemus, for I took him in my own ship from 
<A NAME="376"></A>Scyros with the Achaeans. In our councils of war before Troy he was always 
<A NAME="377"></A>first to speak, and his judgement was unerring. Nestor and I were the only 
<A NAME="378"></A>two who could surpass him; and when it came to fighting on the plain of 
<A NAME="379"></A>Troy, he would never remain with the body of his men, but would dash on 
<A NAME="380"></A>far in front, foremost of them all in valour. Many a man did he kill in 
<A NAME="381"></A>battle- I cannot name every single one of those whom he slew while fighting 
<A NAME="382"></A>on the side of the Argives, but will only say how he killed that valiant 
<A NAME="383"></A>hero Eurypylus son of Telephus, who was the handsomest man I ever saw except 
<A NAME="384"></A>Memnon; many others also of the Ceteians fell around him by reason of a 
<A NAME="385"></A>woman's bribes. Moreover, when all the bravest of the Argives went inside 
<A NAME="386"></A>the horse that Epeus had made, and it was left to me to settle when we 
<A NAME="387"></A>should either open the door of our ambuscade, or close it, though all the 
<A NAME="388"></A>other leaders and chief men among the Danaans were drying their eyes and 
<A NAME="389"></A>quaking in every limb, I never once saw him turn pale nor wipe a tear from 
<A NAME="390"></A>his cheek; he was all the time urging me to break out from the horse- grasping 
<A NAME="391"></A>the handle of his sword and his bronze-shod spear, and breathing fury against 
<A NAME="392"></A>the foe. Yet when we had sacked the city of Priam he got his handsome share 
<A NAME="393"></A>of the prize money and went on board (such is the fortune of war) without 
<A NAME="394"></A>a wound upon him, neither from a thrown spear nor in close combat, for 
<A NAME="395"></A>the rage of Mars is a matter of great chance.'
<A NAME="396"></A><BR><BR>"When I had told him this, the ghost of Achilles strode off across 
<A NAME="397"></A>a meadow full of asphodel, exulting over what I had said concerning the 
<A NAME="398"></A>prowess of his son.
<A NAME="399"></A><BR><BR>"The ghosts of other dead men stood near me and told me each his 
<A NAME="400"></A>own melancholy tale; but that of Ajax son of Telamon alone held aloof- 
<A NAME="401"></A>still angry with me for having won the cause in our dispute about the armour 
<A NAME="402"></A>of Achilles. Thetis had offered it as a prize, but the Trojan prisoners 
<A NAME="403"></A>and Minerva were the judges. Would that I had never gained the day in such 
<A NAME="404"></A>a contest, for it cost the life of Ajax, who was foremost of all the Danaans 
<A NAME="405"></A>after the son of Peleus, alike in stature and prowess.
<A NAME="406"></A><BR><BR>"When I saw him I tried to pacify him and said, 'Ajax, will you 
<A NAME="407"></A>not forget and forgive even in death, but must the judgement about that 
<A NAME="408"></A>hateful armour still rankle with you? It cost us Argives dear enough to 
<A NAME="409"></A>lose such a tower of strength as you were to us. We mourned you as much 
<A NAME="410"></A>as we mourned Achilles son of Peleus himself, nor can the blame be laid 
<A NAME="411"></A>on anything but on the spite which Jove bore against the Danaans, for it 
<A NAME="412"></A>was this that made him counsel your destruction- come hither, therefore, 
<A NAME="413"></A>bring your proud spirit into subjection, and hear what I can tell 
<A NAME="414"></A>you.'
<A NAME="415"></A><BR><BR>"He would not answer, but turned away to Erebus and to the other 
<A NAME="416"></A>ghosts; nevertheless, I should have made him talk to me in spite of his 
<A NAME="417"></A>being so angry, or I should have gone talking to him, only that there were 
<A NAME="418"></A>still others among the dead whom I desired to see.
<A NAME="419"></A><BR><BR>"Then I saw Minos son of Jove with his golden sceptre in his hand 
<A NAME="420"></A>sitting in judgement on the dead, and the ghosts were gathered sitting 
<A NAME="421"></A>and standing round him in the spacious house of Hades, to learn his sentences 
<A NAME="422"></A>upon them.
<A NAME="423"></A><BR><BR>"After him I saw huge Orion in a meadow full of asphodel driving 
<A NAME="424"></A>the ghosts of the wild beasts that he had killed upon the mountains, and 
<A NAME="425"></A>he had a great bronze club in his hand, unbreakable for ever and 
<A NAME="426"></A>ever.
<A NAME="427"></A><BR><BR>"And I saw Tityus son of Gaia stretched upon the plain and covering 
<A NAME="428"></A>some nine acres of ground. Two vultures on either side of him were digging 
<A NAME="429"></A>their beaks into his liver, and he kept on trying to beat them off with 
<A NAME="430"></A>his hands, but could not; for he had violated Jove's mistress Leto as she 
<A NAME="431"></A>was going through Panopeus on her way to Pytho.
<A NAME="432"></A><BR><BR>"I saw also the dreadful fate of Tantalus, who stood in a lake 
<A NAME="433"></A>that reached his chin; he was dying to quench his thirst, but could never 
<A NAME="434"></A>reach the water, for whenever the poor creature stooped to drink, it dried 
<A NAME="435"></A>up and vanished, so that there was nothing but dry ground- parched by the 
<A NAME="436"></A>spite of heaven. There were tall trees, moreover, that shed their fruit 
<A NAME="437"></A>over his head- pears, pomegranates, apples, sweet figs and juicy olives, 
<A NAME="438"></A>but whenever the poor creature stretched out his hand to take some, the 
<A NAME="439"></A>wind tossed the branches back again to the clouds.
<A NAME="440"></A><BR><BR>"And I saw Sisyphus at his endless task raising his prodigious 
<A NAME="441"></A>stone with both his hands. With hands and feet he' tried to roll it up 
<A NAME="442"></A>to the top of the hill, but always, just before he could roll it over on 
<A NAME="443"></A>to the other side, its weight would be too much for him, and the pitiless 
<A NAME="444"></A>stone would come thundering down again on to the plain. Then he would begin 
<A NAME="445"></A>trying to push it up hill again, and the sweat ran off him and the steam 
<A NAME="446"></A>rose after him.
<A NAME="447"></A><BR><BR>"After him I saw mighty Hercules, but it was his phantom only, 
<A NAME="448"></A>for he is feasting ever with the immortal gods, and has lovely Hebe to 
<A NAME="449"></A>wife, who is daughter of Jove and Juno. The ghosts were screaming round 
<A NAME="450"></A>him like scared birds flying all whithers. He looked black as night with 
<A NAME="451"></A>his bare bow in his hands and his arrow on the string, glaring around as 
<A NAME="452"></A>though ever on the point of taking aim. About his breast there was a wondrous 
<A NAME="453"></A>golden belt adorned in the most marvellous fashion with bears, wild boars, 
<A NAME="454"></A>and lions with gleaming eyes; there was also war, battle, and death. The 
<A NAME="455"></A>man who made that belt, do what he might, would never be able to make another 
<A NAME="456"></A>like it. Hercules knew me at once when he saw me, and spoke piteously, 
<A NAME="457"></A>saying, my poor Ulysses, noble son of Laertes, are you too leading the 
<A NAME="458"></A>same sorry kind of life that I did when I was above ground? I was son of 
<A NAME="459"></A>Jove, but I went through an infinity of suffering, for I became bondsman 
<A NAME="460"></A>to one who was far beneath me- a low fellow who set me all manner of labours. 
<A NAME="461"></A>He once sent me here to fetch the hell-hound- for he did not think he could 
<A NAME="462"></A>find anything harder for me than this, but I got the hound out of Hades 
<A NAME="463"></A>and brought him to him, for Mercury and Minerva helped 
<A NAME="464"></A>me.'
<A NAME="465"></A><BR><BR>"On this Hercules went down again into the house of Hades, but 
<A NAME="466"></A>I stayed where I was in case some other of the mighty dead should come 
<A NAME="467"></A>to me. And I should have seen still other of them that are gone before, 
<A NAME="468"></A>whom I would fain have seen- Theseus and Pirithous glorious children of 
<A NAME="469"></A>the gods, but so many thousands of ghosts came round me and uttered such 
<A NAME="470"></A>appalling cries, that I was panic stricken lest Proserpine should send 
<A NAME="471"></A>up from the house of Hades the head of that awful monster Gorgon. On this 
<A NAME="472"></A>I hastened back to my ship and ordered my men to go on board at once and 
<A NAME="473"></A>loose the hawsers; so they embarked and took their places, whereon the 
<A NAME="474"></A>ship went down the stream of the river Oceanus. We had to row at first, 
<A NAME="475"></A>but presently a fair wind sprang up.
