<A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A>Now the other gods and the armed warriors on the plain slept soundly, but 
<A NAME="11"></A>Jove was wakeful, for he was thinking how to do honour to Achilles, and 
<A NAME="12"></A>destroyed much people at the ships of the Achaeans. In the end he deemed 
<A NAME="13"></A>it would be best to send a lying dream to King Agamemnon; so he called 
<A NAME="14"></A>one to him and said to it, "Lying Dream, go to the ships of the Achaeans, 
<A NAME="15"></A>into the tent of Agamemnon, and say to him word to word as I now bid you. 
<A NAME="16"></A>Tell him to get the Achaeans instantly under arms, for he shall take Troy. 
<A NAME="17"></A>There are no longer divided counsels among the gods; Juno has brought them 
<A NAME="18"></A>to her own mind, and woe betides the Trojans."
<A NAME="19"></A><BR><BR>The dream went when it had heard its message, and soon reached 
<A NAME="20"></A>the ships of the Achaeans. It sought Agamemnon son of Atreus and found 
<A NAME="21"></A>him in his tent, wrapped in a profound slumber. It hovered over his head 
<A NAME="22"></A>in the likeness of Nestor, son of Neleus, whom Agamemnon honoured above 
<A NAME="23"></A>all his councillors, and said:-
<A NAME="24"></A><BR><BR>"You are sleeping, son of Atreus; one who has the welfare of his 
<A NAME="25"></A>host and so much other care upon his shoulders should dock his sleep. Hear 
<A NAME="26"></A>me at once, for I come as a messenger from Jove, who, though he be not 
<A NAME="27"></A>near, yet takes thought for you and pities you. He bids you get the Achaeans 
<A NAME="28"></A>instantly under arms, for you shall take Troy. There are no longer divided 
<A NAME="29"></A>counsels among the gods; Juno has brought them over to her own mind, and 
<A NAME="30"></A>woe betides the Trojans at the hands of Jove. Remember this, and when you 
<A NAME="31"></A>wake see that it does not escape you."
<A NAME="32"></A><BR><BR>The dream then left him, and he thought of things that were, surely 
<A NAME="33"></A>not to be accomplished. He thought that on that same day he was to take 
<A NAME="34"></A>the city of Priam, but he little knew what was in the mind of Jove, who 
<A NAME="35"></A>had many another hard-fought fight in store alike for Danaans and Trojans. 
<A NAME="36"></A>Then presently he woke, with the divine message still ringing in his ears; 
<A NAME="37"></A>so he sat upright, and put on his soft shirt so fair and new, and over 
<A NAME="38"></A>this his heavy cloak. He bound his sandals on to his comely feet, and slung 
<A NAME="39"></A>his silver-studded sword about his shoulders; then he took the imperishable 
<A NAME="40"></A>staff of his father, and sallied forth to the ships of the 
<A NAME="41"></A>Achaeans.
<A NAME="42"></A><BR><BR>The goddess Dawn now wended her way to vast Olympus that she might 
<A NAME="43"></A>herald day to Jove and to the other immortals, and Agamemnon sent the criers 
<A NAME="44"></A>round to call the people in assembly; so they called them and the people 
<A NAME="45"></A>gathered thereon. But first he summoned a meeting of the elders at the 
<A NAME="46"></A>ship of Nestor king of Pylos, and when they were assembled he laid a cunning 
<A NAME="47"></A>counsel before them.
<A NAME="48"></A><BR><BR>"My friends," said he, "I have had a dream from heaven in the dead 
<A NAME="49"></A>of night, and its face and figure resembled none but Nestor's. It hovered 
<A NAME="50"></A>over my head and said, 'You are sleeping, son of Atreus; one who has the 
<A NAME="51"></A>welfare of his host and so much other care upon his shoulders should dock 
<A NAME="52"></A>his sleep. Hear me at once, for I am a messenger from Jove, who, though 
<A NAME="53"></A>he be not near, yet takes thought for you and pities you. He bids you get 
<A NAME="54"></A>the Achaeans instantly under arms, for you shall take Troy. There are no 
<A NAME="55"></A>longer divided counsels among the gods; Juno has brought them over to her 
<A NAME="56"></A>own mind, and woe betides the Trojans at the hands of Jove. Remember this.' 
<A NAME="57"></A>The dream then vanished and I awoke. Let us now, therefore, arm the sons 
<A NAME="58"></A>of the Achaeans. But it will be well that I should first sound them, and 
<A NAME="59"></A>to this end I will tell them to fly with their ships; but do you others 
<A NAME="60"></A>go about among the host and prevent their doing so."
<A NAME="61"></A><BR><BR>He then sat down, and Nestor the prince of Pylos with all sincerity 
<A NAME="62"></A>and goodwill addressed them thus: "My friends," said he, "princes and councillors 
<A NAME="63"></A>of the Argives, if any other man of the Achaeans had told us of this dream 
<A NAME="64"></A>we should have declared it false, and would have had nothing to do with 
<A NAME="65"></A>it. But he who has seen it is the foremost man among us; we must therefore 
<A NAME="66"></A>set about getting the people under arms."
<A NAME="67"></A><BR><BR>With this he led the way from the assembly, and the other sceptred 
<A NAME="68"></A>kings rose with him in obedience to the word of Agamemnon; but the people 
<A NAME="69"></A>pressed forward to hear. They swarmed like bees that sally from some hollow 
<A NAME="70"></A>cave and flit in countless throng among the spring flowers, bunched in 
<A NAME="71"></A>knots and clusters; even so did the mighty multitude pour from ships and 
<A NAME="72"></A>tents to the assembly, and range themselves upon the wide-watered shore, 
<A NAME="73"></A>while among them ran Wildfire Rumour, messenger of Jove, urging them ever 
<A NAME="74"></A>to the fore. Thus they gathered in a pell-mell of mad confusion, and the 
<A NAME="75"></A>earth groaned under the tramp of men as the people sought their places. 
<A NAME="76"></A>Nine heralds went crying about among them to stay their tumult and bid 
<A NAME="77"></A>them listen to the kings, till at last they were got into their several 
<A NAME="78"></A>places and ceased their clamour. Then King Agamemnon rose, holding his 
<A NAME="79"></A>sceptre. This was the work of Vulcan, who gave it to Jove the son of Saturn. 
<A NAME="80"></A>Jove gave it to Mercury, slayer of Argus, guide and guardian. King Mercury 
<A NAME="81"></A>gave it to Pelops, the mighty charioteer, and Pelops to Atreus, shepherd 
<A NAME="82"></A>of his people. Atreus, when he died, left it to Thyestes, rich in flocks, 
<A NAME="83"></A>and Thyestes in his turn left it to be borne by Agamemnon, that he might 
<A NAME="84"></A>be lord of all Argos and of the isles. Leaning, then, on his sceptre, he 
<A NAME="85"></A>addressed the Argives.
<A NAME="86"></A><BR><BR>"My friends," he said, "heroes, servants of Mars, the hand of heaven 
<A NAME="87"></A>has been laid heavily upon me. Cruel Jove gave me his solemn promise that 
<A NAME="88"></A>I should sack the city of Priam before returning, but he has played me 
<A NAME="89"></A>false, and is now bidding me go ingloriously back to Argos with the loss 
<A NAME="90"></A>of much people. Such is the will of Jove, who has laid many a proud city 
<A NAME="91"></A>in the dust, as he will yet lay others, for his power is above all. It 
<A NAME="92"></A>will be a sorry tale hereafter that an Achaean host, at once so great and 
<A NAME="93"></A>valiant, battled in vain against men fewer in number than themselves; but 
<A NAME="94"></A>as yet the end is not in sight. Think that the Achaeans and Trojans have 
<A NAME="95"></A>sworn to a solemn covenant, and that they have each been numbered- the 
<A NAME="96"></A>Trojans by the roll of their householders, and we by companies of ten; 
<A NAME="97"></A>think further that each of our companies desired to have a Trojan householder 
<A NAME="98"></A>to pour out their wine; we are so greatly more in number that full many 
<A NAME="99"></A>a company would have to go without its cup-bearer. But they have in the 
<A NAME="100"></A>town allies from other places, and it is these that hinder me from being 
<A NAME="101"></A>able to sack the rich city of Ilius. Nine of Jove years are gone; the timbers 
<A NAME="102"></A>of our ships have rotted; their tackling is sound no longer. Our wives 
<A NAME="103"></A>and little ones at home look anxiously for our coming, but the work that 
<A NAME="104"></A>we came hither to do has not been done. Now, therefore, let us all do as 
<A NAME="105"></A>I say: let us sail back to our own land, for we shall not take 
<A NAME="106"></A>Troy."
<A NAME="107"></A><BR><BR>With these words he moved the hearts of the multitude, so many 
<A NAME="108"></A>of them as knew not the cunning counsel of Agamemnon. They surged to and 
<A NAME="109"></A>fro like the waves of the Icarian Sea, when the east and south winds break 
<A NAME="110"></A>from heaven's clouds to lash them; or as when the west wind sweeps over 
<A NAME="111"></A>a field of corn and the ears bow beneath the blast, even so were they swayed 
<A NAME="112"></A>as they flew with loud cries towards the ships, and the dust from under 
<A NAME="113"></A>their feet rose heavenward. They cheered each other on to draw the ships 
<A NAME="114"></A>into the sea; they cleared the channels in front of them; they began taking 
<A NAME="115"></A>away the stays from underneath them, and the welkin rang with their glad 
<A NAME="116"></A>cries, so eager were they to return.
<A NAME="117"></A><BR><BR>Then surely the Argives would have returned after a fashion that 
<A NAME="118"></A>was not fated. But Juno said to Minerva, "Alas, daughter of aegis-bearing 
<A NAME="119"></A>Jove, unweariable, shall the Argives fly home to their own land over the 
<A NAME="120"></A>broad sea, and leave Priam and the Trojans the glory of still keeping Helen, 
<A NAME="121"></A>for whose sake so many of the Achaeans have died at Troy, far from their 
<A NAME="122"></A>homes? Go about at once among the host, and speak fairly to them, man by 
<A NAME="123"></A>man, that they draw not their ships into the sea."
<A NAME="124"></A><BR><BR>Minerva was not slack to do her bidding. Down she darted from the 
<A NAME="125"></A>topmost summits of Olympus, and in a moment she was at the ships of the 
<A NAME="126"></A>Achaeans. There she found Ulysses, peer of Jove in counsel, standing alone. 
<A NAME="127"></A>He had not as yet laid a hand upon his ship, for he was grieved and sorry; 
<A NAME="128"></A>so she went close up to him and said, "Ulysses, noble son of Laertes, are 
<A NAME="129"></A>you going to fling yourselves into your ships and be off home to your own 
<A NAME="130"></A>land in this way? Will you leave Priam and the Trojans the glory of still 
<A NAME="131"></A>keeping Helen, for whose sake so many of the Achaeans have died at Troy, 
<A NAME="132"></A>far from their homes? Go about at once among the host, and speak fairly 
<A NAME="133"></A>to them, man by man, that they draw not their ships into the 
<A NAME="134"></A>sea."
<A NAME="135"></A><BR><BR>Ulysses knew the voice as that of the goddess: he flung his cloak 
<A NAME="136"></A>from him and set off to run. His servant Eurybates, a man of Ithaca, who 
<A NAME="137"></A>waited on him, took charge of the cloak, whereon Ulysses went straight 
<A NAME="138"></A>up to Agamemnon and received from him his ancestral, imperishable staff. 
<A NAME="139"></A>With this he went about among the ships of the Achaeans.
<A NAME="140"></A><BR><BR>Whenever he met a king or chieftain, he stood by him and spoke 
<A NAME="141"></A>him fairly. "Sir," said he, "this flight is cowardly and unworthy. Stand 
<A NAME="142"></A>to your post, and bid your people also keep their places. You do not yet 
<A NAME="143"></A>know the full mind of Agamemnon; he was sounding us, and ere long will 
<A NAME="144"></A>visit the Achaeans with his displeasure. We were not all of us at the council 
<A NAME="145"></A>to hear what he then said; see to it lest he be angry and do us a mischief; 
<A NAME="146"></A>for the pride of kings is great, and the hand of Jove is with 
<A NAME="147"></A>them."
<A NAME="148"></A><BR><BR>But when he came across any common man who was making a noise, 
<A NAME="149"></A>he struck him with his staff and rebuked him, saying, "Sirrah, hold your 
<A NAME="150"></A>peace, and listen to better men than yourself. You are a coward and no 
<A NAME="151"></A>soldier; you are nobody either in fight or council; we cannot all be kings; 
<A NAME="152"></A>it is not well that there should be many masters; one man must be supreme- 
<A NAME="153"></A>one king to whom the son of scheming Saturn has given the sceptre of sovereignty 
<A NAME="154"></A>over you all."
<A NAME="155"></A><BR><BR>Thus masterfully did he go about among the host, and the people 
<A NAME="156"></A>hurried back to the council from their tents and ships with a sound as 
<A NAME="157"></A>the thunder of surf when it comes crashing down upon the shore, and all 
<A NAME="158"></A>the sea is in an uproar.
<A NAME="159"></A><BR><BR>The rest now took their seats and kept to their own several places, 
<A NAME="160"></A>but Thersites still went on wagging his unbridled tongue- a man of many 
<A NAME="161"></A>words, and those unseemly; a monger of sedition, a railer against all who 
<A NAME="162"></A>were in authority, who cared not what he said, so that he might set the 
<A NAME="163"></A>Achaeans in a laugh. He was the ugliest man of all those that came before 
<A NAME="164"></A>Troy- bandy-legged, lame of one foot, with his two shoulders rounded and 
<A NAME="165"></A>hunched over his chest. His head ran up to a point, but there was little 
<A NAME="166"></A>hair on the top of it. Achilles and Ulysses hated him worst of all, for 
<A NAME="167"></A>it was with them that he was most wont to wrangle; now, however, with a 
<A NAME="168"></A>shrill squeaky voice he began heaping his abuse on Agamemnon. The Achaeans 
<A NAME="169"></A>were angry and disgusted, yet none the less he kept on brawling and bawling 
<A NAME="170"></A>at the son of Atreus.
<A NAME="171"></A><BR><BR>"Agamemnon," he cried, "what ails you now, and what more do you 
<A NAME="172"></A>want? Your tents are filled with bronze and with fair women, for whenever 
<A NAME="173"></A>we take a town we give you the pick of them. Would you have yet more gold, 
<A NAME="174"></A>which some Trojan is to give you as a ransom for his son, when I or another 
<A NAME="175"></A>Achaean has taken him prisoner? or is it some young girl to hide and lie 
<A NAME="176"></A>with? It is not well that you, the ruler of the Achaeans, should bring 
<A NAME="177"></A>them into such misery. Weakling cowards, women rather than men, let us 
<A NAME="178"></A>sail home, and leave this fellow here at Troy to stew in his own meeds 
<A NAME="179"></A>of honour, and discover whether we were of any service to him or no. Achilles 
<A NAME="180"></A>is a much better man than he is, and see how he has treated him- robbing 
<A NAME="181"></A>him of his prize and keeping it himself. Achilles takes it meekly and shows 
<A NAME="182"></A>no fight; if he did, son of Atreus, you would never again insult 
<A NAME="183"></A>him."
<A NAME="184"></A><BR><BR>Thus railed Thersites, but Ulysses at once went up to him and rebuked 
<A NAME="185"></A>him sternly. "Check your glib tongue, Thersites," said be, "and babble 
<A NAME="186"></A>not a word further. Chide not with princes when you have none to back you. 
<A NAME="187"></A>There is no viler creature come before Troy with the sons of Atreus. Drop 
<A NAME="188"></A>this chatter about kings, and neither revile them nor keep harping about 
<A NAME="189"></A>going home. We do not yet know how things are going to be, nor whether 
<A NAME="190"></A>the Achaeans are to return with good success or evil. How dare you gibe 
<A NAME="191"></A>at Agamemnon because the Danaans have awarded him so many prizes? I tell 
<A NAME="192"></A>you, therefore- and it shall surely be- that if I again catch you talking 
<A NAME="193"></A>such nonsense, I will either forfeit my own head and be no more called 
<A NAME="194"></A>father of Telemachus, or I will take you, strip you stark naked, and whip 
<A NAME="195"></A>you out of the assembly till you go blubbering back to the 
<A NAME="196"></A>ships."
<A NAME="197"></A><BR><BR>On this he beat him with his staff about the back and shoulders 
<A NAME="198"></A>till he dropped and fell a-weeping. The golden sceptre raised a bloody 
<A NAME="199"></A>weal on his back, so he sat down frightened and in pain, looking foolish 
<A NAME="200"></A>as he wiped the tears from his eyes. The people were sorry for him, yet 
<A NAME="201"></A>they laughed heartily, and one would turn to his neighbour saying, "Ulysses 
<A NAME="202"></A>has done many a good thing ere now in fight and council, but he never did 
<A NAME="203"></A>the Argives a better turn than when he stopped this fellow's mouth from 
<A NAME="204"></A>prating further. He will give the kings no more of his 
<A NAME="205"></A>insolence."
<A NAME="206"></A><BR><BR>Thus said the people. Then Ulysses rose, sceptre in hand, and Minerva 
<A NAME="207"></A>in the likeness of a herald bade the people be still, that those who were 
<A NAME="208"></A>far off might hear him and consider his council. He therefore with all 
<A NAME="209"></A>sincerity and goodwill addressed them thus:-
<A NAME="210"></A><BR><BR>"King Agamemnon, the Achaeans are for making you a by-word among 
<A NAME="211"></A>all mankind. They forget the promise they made you when they set out from 
<A NAME="212"></A>Argos, that you should not return till you had sacked the town of Troy, 
<A NAME="213"></A>and, like children or widowed women, they murmur and would set off homeward. 
<A NAME="214"></A>True it is that they have had toil enough to be disheartened. A man chafes 
<A NAME="215"></A>at having to stay away from his wife even for a single month, when he is 
<A NAME="216"></A>on shipboard, at the mercy of wind and sea, but it is now nine long years 
<A NAME="217"></A>that we have been kept here; I cannot, therefore, blame the Achaeans if 
<A NAME="218"></A>they turn restive; still we shall be shamed if we go home empty after so 
<A NAME="219"></A>long a stay- therefore, my friends, be patient yet a little longer that 
<A NAME="220"></A>we may learn whether the prophesyings of Calchas were false or 
<A NAME="221"></A>true.
<A NAME="222"></A><BR><BR>"All who have not since perished must remember as though it were 
<A NAME="223"></A>yesterday or the day before, how the ships of the Achaeans were detained 
<A NAME="224"></A>in Aulis when we were on our way hither to make war on Priam and the Trojans. 
<A NAME="225"></A>We were ranged round about a fountain offering hecatombs to the gods upon 
<A NAME="226"></A>their holy altars, and there was a fine plane-tree from beneath which there 
<A NAME="227"></A>welled a stream of pure water. Then we saw a prodigy; for Jove sent a fearful 
<A NAME="228"></A>serpent out of the ground, with blood-red stains upon its back, and it 
<A NAME="229"></A>darted from under the altar on to the plane-tree. Now there was a brood 
<A NAME="230"></A>of young sparrows, quite small, upon the topmost bough, peeping out from 
<A NAME="231"></A>under the leaves, eight in all, and their mother that hatched them made 
<A NAME="232"></A>nine. The serpent ate the poor cheeping things, while the old bird flew 
<A NAME="233"></A>about lamenting her little ones; but the serpent threw his coils about 
<A NAME="234"></A>her and caught her by the wing as she was screaming. Then, when he had 
<A NAME="235"></A>eaten both the sparrow and her young, the god who had sent him made him 
<A NAME="236"></A>become a sign; for the son of scheming Saturn turned him into stone, and 
<A NAME="237"></A>we stood there wondering at that which had come to pass. Seeing, then, 
<A NAME="238"></A>that such a fearful portent had broken in upon our hecatombs, Calchas forthwith 
<A NAME="239"></A>declared to us the oracles of heaven. 'Why, Achaeans,' said he, 'are you 
<A NAME="240"></A>thus speechless? Jove has sent us this sign, long in coming, and long ere 
<A NAME="241"></A>it be fulfilled, though its fame shall last for ever. As the serpent ate 
<A NAME="242"></A>the eight fledglings and the sparrow that hatched them, which makes nine, 
<A NAME="243"></A>so shall we fight nine years at Troy, but in the tenth shall take the town.' 
<A NAME="244"></A>This was what he said, and now it is all coming true. Stay here, therefore, 
<A NAME="245"></A>all of you, till we take the city of Priam."
<A NAME="246"></A><BR><BR>On this the Argives raised a shout, till the ships rang again with 
<A NAME="247"></A>the uproar. Nestor, knight of Gerene, then addressed them. "Shame on you," 
<A NAME="248"></A>he cried, "to stay talking here like children, when you should fight like 
<A NAME="249"></A>men. Where are our covenants now, and where the oaths that we have taken? 
<A NAME="250"></A>Shall our counsels be flung into the fire, with our drink-offerings and 
<A NAME="251"></A>the right hands of fellowship wherein we have put our trust? We waste our 
<A NAME="252"></A>time in words, and for all our talking here shall be no further forward. 
<A NAME="253"></A>Stand, therefore, son of Atreus, by your own steadfast purpose; lead the 
<A NAME="254"></A>Argives on to battle, and leave this handful of men to rot, who scheme, 
<A NAME="255"></A>and scheme in vain, to get back to Argos ere they have learned whether 
<A NAME="256"></A>Jove be true or a liar. For the mighty son of Saturn surely promised that 
<A NAME="257"></A>we should succeed, when we Argives set sail to bring death and destruction 
<A NAME="258"></A>upon the Trojans. He showed us favourable signs by flashing his lightning 
<A NAME="259"></A>on our right hands; therefore let none make haste to go till he has first 
<A NAME="260"></A>lain with the wife of some Trojan, and avenged the toil and sorrow that 
<A NAME="261"></A>he has suffered for the sake of Helen. Nevertheless, if any man is in such 
<A NAME="262"></A>haste to be at home again, let him lay his hand to his ship that he may 
<A NAME="263"></A>meet his doom in the sight of all. But, O king, consider and give ear to 
<A NAME="264"></A>my counsel, for the word that I say may not be neglected lightly. Divide 
<A NAME="265"></A>your men, Agamemnon, into their several tribes and clans, that clans and 
<A NAME="266"></A>tribes may stand by and help one another. If you do this, and if the Achaeans 
<A NAME="267"></A>obey you, you will find out who, both chiefs and peoples, are brave, and 
<A NAME="268"></A>who are cowards; for they will vie against the other. Thus you shall also 
<A NAME="269"></A>learn whether it is through the counsel of heaven or the cowardice of man 
<A NAME="270"></A>that you shall fail to take the town."
<A NAME="271"></A><BR><BR>And Agamemnon answered, "Nestor, you have again outdone the sons 
<A NAME="272"></A>of the Achaeans in counsel. Would, by Father Jove, Minerva, and Apollo, 
<A NAME="273"></A>that I had among them ten more such councillors, for the city of King Priam 
<A NAME="274"></A>would then soon fall beneath our hands, and we should sack it. But the 
<A NAME="275"></A>son of Saturn afflicts me with bootless wranglings and strife. Achilles 
<A NAME="276"></A>and I are quarrelling about this girl, in which matter I was the first 
<A NAME="277"></A>to offend; if we can be of one mind again, the Trojans will not stave off 
<A NAME="278"></A>destruction for a day. Now, therefore, get your morning meal, that our 
<A NAME="279"></A>hosts join in fight. Whet well your spears; see well to the ordering of 
<A NAME="280"></A>your shields; give good feeds to your horses, and look your chariots carefully 
<A NAME="281"></A>over, that we may do battle the livelong day; for we shall have no rest, 
<A NAME="282"></A>not for a moment, till night falls to part us. The bands that bear your 
<A NAME="283"></A>shields shall be wet with the sweat upon your shoulders, your hands shall 
<A NAME="284"></A>weary upon your spears, your horses shall steam in front of your chariots, 
<A NAME="285"></A>and if I see any man shirking the fight, or trying to keep out of it at 
<A NAME="286"></A>the ships, there shall be no help for him, but he shall be a prey to dogs 
<A NAME="287"></A>and vultures."
<A NAME="288"></A><BR><BR>Thus he spoke, and the Achaeans roared applause. As when the waves 
<A NAME="289"></A>run high before the blast of the south wind and break on some lofty headland, 
<A NAME="290"></A>dashing against it and buffeting it without ceasing, as the storms from 
<A NAME="291"></A>every quarter drive them, even so did the Achaeans rise and hurry in all 
<A NAME="292"></A>directions to their ships. There they lighted their fires at their tents 
<A NAME="293"></A>and got dinner, offering sacrifice every man to one or other of the gods, 
<A NAME="294"></A>and praying each one of them that he might live to come out of the fight. 
<A NAME="295"></A>Agamemnon, king of men, sacrificed a fat five-year-old bull to the mighty 
<A NAME="296"></A>son of Saturn, and invited the princes and elders of his host. First he 
<A NAME="297"></A>asked Nestor and King Idomeneus, then the two Ajaxes and the son of Tydeus, 
<A NAME="298"></A>and sixthly Ulysses, peer of gods in counsel; but Menelaus came of his 
<A NAME="299"></A>own accord, for he knew how busy his brother then was. They stood round 
<A NAME="300"></A>the bull with the barley-meal in their hands, and Agamemnon prayed, saying, 
<A NAME="301"></A>"Jove, most glorious, supreme, that dwellest in heaven, and ridest upon 
<A NAME="302"></A>the storm-cloud, grant that the sun may not go down, nor the night fall, 
<A NAME="303"></A>till the palace of Priam is laid low, and its gates are consumed with fire. 
<A NAME="304"></A>Grant that my sword may pierce the shirt of Hector about his heart, and 
<A NAME="305"></A>that full many of his comrades may bite the dust as they fall dying round 
<A NAME="306"></A>him."
<A NAME="307"></A><BR><BR>Thus he prayed, but the son of Saturn would not fulfil his prayer. 
<A NAME="308"></A>He accepted the sacrifice, yet none the less increased their toil continually. 
<A NAME="309"></A>When they had done praying and sprinkling the barley-meal upon the victim, 
<A NAME="310"></A>they drew back its head, killed it, and then flayed it. They cut out the 
<A NAME="311"></A>thigh-bones, wrapped them round in two layers of fat, and set pieces of 
<A NAME="312"></A>raw meat on the top of them. These they burned upon the split logs of firewood, 
<A NAME="313"></A>but they spitted the inward meats, and held them in the flames to cook. 
<A NAME="314"></A>When the thigh-bones were burned, and they had tasted the inward meats, 
<A NAME="315"></A>they cut the rest up small, put the pieces upon spits, roasted them till 
<A NAME="316"></A>they were done, and drew them off; then, when they had finished their work 
<A NAME="317"></A>and the feast was ready, they ate it, and every man had his full share, 
<A NAME="318"></A>so that all were satisfied. As soon as they had had enough to eat and drink, 
<A NAME="319"></A>Nestor, knight of Gerene, began to speak. "King Agamemnon," said he, "let 
<A NAME="320"></A>us not stay talking here, nor be slack in the work that heaven has put 
<A NAME="321"></A>into our hands. Let the heralds summon the people to gather at their several 
<A NAME="322"></A>ships; we will then go about among the host, that we may begin fighting 
<A NAME="323"></A>at once."
<A NAME="324"></A><BR><BR>Thus did he speak, and Agamemnon heeded his words. He at once sent 
<A NAME="325"></A>the criers round to call the people in assembly. So they called them, and 
<A NAME="326"></A>the people gathered thereon. The chiefs about the son of Atreus chose their 
<A NAME="327"></A>men and marshalled them, while Minerva went among them holding her priceless 
<A NAME="328"></A>aegis that knows neither age nor death. From it there waved a hundred tassels 
<A NAME="329"></A>of pure gold, all deftly woven, and each one of them worth a hundred oxen. 
<A NAME="330"></A>With this she darted furiously everywhere among the hosts of the Achaeans, 
<A NAME="331"></A>urging them forward, and putting courage into the heart of each, so that 
<A NAME="332"></A>he might fight and do battle without ceasing. Thus war became sweeter in 
<A NAME="333"></A>their eyes even than returning home in their ships. As when some great 
<A NAME="334"></A>forest fire is raging upon a mountain top and its light is seen afar, even 
<A NAME="335"></A>so as they marched the gleam of their armour flashed up into the firmament 
<A NAME="336"></A>of heaven.
<A NAME="337"></A><BR><BR>They were like great flocks of geese, or cranes, or swans on the 
<A NAME="338"></A>plain about the waters of Cayster, that wing their way hither and thither, 
<A NAME="339"></A>glorying in the pride of flight, and crying as they settle till the fen 
<A NAME="340"></A>is alive with their screaming. Even thus did their tribes pour from ships 
<A NAME="341"></A>and tents on to the plain of the Scamander, and the ground rang as brass 
<A NAME="342"></A>under the feet of men and horses. They stood as thick upon the flower-bespangled 
<A NAME="343"></A>field as leaves that bloom in summer.
<A NAME="344"></A><BR><BR>As countless swarms of flies buzz around a herdsman's homestead 
<A NAME="345"></A>in the time of spring when the pails are drenched with milk, even so did 
<A NAME="346"></A>the Achaeans swarm on to the plain to charge the Trojans and destroy 
<A NAME="347"></A>them.
<A NAME="348"></A><BR><BR>The chiefs disposed their men this way and that before the fight 
<A NAME="349"></A>began, drafting them out as easily as goatherds draft their flocks when 
<A NAME="350"></A>they have got mixed while feeding; and among them went King Agamemnon, 
<A NAME="351"></A>with a head and face like Jove the lord of thunder, a waist like Mars, 
<A NAME="352"></A>and a chest like that of Neptune. As some great bull that lords it over 
<A NAME="353"></A>the herds upon the plain, even so did Jove make the son of Atreus stand 
<A NAME="354"></A>peerless among the multitude of heroes.
<A NAME="355"></A><BR><BR>And now, O Muses, dwellers in the mansions of Olympus, tell me- 
<A NAME="356"></A>for you are goddesses and are in all places so that you see all things, 
<A NAME="357"></A>while we know nothing but by report- who were the chiefs and princes of 
<A NAME="358"></A>the Danaans? As for the common soldiers, they were so that I could not 
<A NAME="359"></A>name every single one of them though I had ten tongues, and though my voice 
<A NAME="360"></A>failed not and my heart were of bronze within me, unless you, O Olympian 
<A NAME="361"></A>Muses, daughters of aegis-bearing Jove, were to recount them to me. Nevertheless, 
<A NAME="362"></A>I will tell the captains of the ships and all the fleet 
<A NAME="363"></A>together.
<A NAME="364"></A><BR><BR>Peneleos, Leitus, Arcesilaus, Prothoenor, and Clonius were captains 
<A NAME="365"></A>of the Boeotians. These were they that dwelt in Hyria and rocky Aulis, 
<A NAME="366"></A>and who held Schoenus, Scolus, and the highlands of Eteonus, with Thespeia, 
<A NAME="367"></A>Graia, and the fair city of Mycalessus. They also held Harma, Eilesium, 
<A NAME="368"></A>and Erythrae; and they had Eleon, Hyle, and Peteon; Ocalea and the strong 
<A NAME="369"></A>fortress of Medeon; Copae, Eutresis, and Thisbe the haunt of doves; Coronea, 
<A NAME="370"></A>and the pastures of Haliartus; Plataea and Glisas; the fortress of Thebes 
<A NAME="371"></A>the less; holy Onchestus with its famous grove of Neptune; Arne rich in 
<A NAME="372"></A>vineyards; Midea, sacred Nisa, and Anthedon upon the sea. From these there 
<A NAME="373"></A>came fifty ships, and in each there were a hundred and twenty young men 
<A NAME="374"></A>of the Boeotians.
<A NAME="375"></A><BR><BR>Ascalaphus and Ialmenus, sons of Mars, led the people that dwelt 
<A NAME="376"></A>in Aspledon and Orchomenus the realm of Minyas. Astyoche a noble maiden 
<A NAME="377"></A>bore them in the house of Actor son of Azeus; for she had gone with Mars 
<A NAME="378"></A>secretly into an upper chamber, and he had lain with her. With these there 
<A NAME="379"></A>came thirty ships.
<A NAME="380"></A><BR><BR>The Phoceans were led by Schedius and Epistrophus, sons of mighty 
<A NAME="381"></A>Iphitus the son of Naubolus. These were they that held Cyparissus, rocky 
<A NAME="382"></A>Pytho, holy Crisa, Daulis, and Panopeus; they also that dwelt in Anemorea 
<A NAME="383"></A>and Hyampolis, and about the waters of the river Cephissus, and Lilaea 
<A NAME="384"></A>by the springs of the Cephissus; with their chieftains came forty ships, 
<A NAME="385"></A>and they marshalled the forces of the Phoceans, which were stationed next 
<A NAME="386"></A>to the Boeotians, on their left.
<A NAME="387"></A><BR><BR>Ajax, the fleet son of Oileus, commanded the Locrians. He was not 
<A NAME="388"></A>so great, nor nearly so great, as Ajax the son of Telamon. He was a little 
<A NAME="389"></A>man, and his breastplate was made of linen, but in use of the spear he 
<A NAME="390"></A>excelled all the Hellenes and the Achaeans. These dwelt in Cynus, Opous, 
<A NAME="391"></A>Calliarus, Bessa, Scarphe, fair Augeae, Tarphe, and Thronium about the 
<A NAME="392"></A>river Boagrius. With him there came forty ships of the Locrians who dwell 
<A NAME="393"></A>beyond Euboea.
<A NAME="394"></A><BR><BR>The fierce Abantes held Euboea with its cities, Chalcis, Eretria, 
<A NAME="395"></A>Histiaea rich in vines, Cerinthus upon the sea, and the rock-perched town 
<A NAME="396"></A>of Dium; with them were also the men of Carystus and Styra; Elephenor of 
<A NAME="397"></A>the race of Mars was in command of these; he was son of Chalcodon, and 
<A NAME="398"></A>chief over all the Abantes. With him they came, fleet of foot and wearing 
<A NAME="399"></A>their hair long behind, brave warriors, who would ever strive to tear open 
<A NAME="400"></A>the corslets of their foes with their long ashen spears. Of these there 
<A NAME="401"></A>came fifty ships.
<A NAME="402"></A><BR><BR>And they that held the strong city of Athens, the people of great 
<A NAME="403"></A>Erechtheus, who was born of the soil itself, but Jove's daughter, Minerva, 
<A NAME="404"></A>fostered him, and established him at Athens in her own rich sanctuary. 
<A NAME="405"></A>There, year by year, the Athenian youths worship him with sacrifices of 
<A NAME="406"></A>bulls and rams. These were commanded by Menestheus, son of Peteos. No man 
<A NAME="407"></A>living could equal him in the marshalling of chariots and foot soldiers. 
<A NAME="408"></A>Nestor could alone rival him, for he was older. With him there came fifty 
<A NAME="409"></A>ships.
<A NAME="410"></A><BR><BR>Ajax brought twelve ships from Salamis, and stationed them alongside 
<A NAME="411"></A>those of the Athenians.
<A NAME="412"></A><BR><BR>The men of Argos, again, and those who held the walls of Tiryns, 
<A NAME="413"></A>with Hermione, and Asine upon the gulf; Troezene, Eionae, and the vineyard 
<A NAME="414"></A>lands of Epidaurus; the Achaean youths, moreover, who came from Aegina 
<A NAME="415"></A>and Mases; these were led by Diomed of the loud battle-cry, and Sthenelus 
<A NAME="416"></A>son of famed Capaneus. With them in command was Euryalus, son of king Mecisteus, 
<A NAME="417"></A>son of Talaus; but Diomed was chief over them all. With these there came 
<A NAME="418"></A>eighty ships.
<A NAME="419"></A><BR><BR>Those who held the strong city of Mycenae, rich Corinth and Cleonae; 
<A NAME="420"></A>Orneae, Araethyrea, and Licyon, where Adrastus reigned of old; Hyperesia, 
<A NAME="421"></A>high Gonoessa, and Pellene; Aegium and all the coast-land round about Helice; 
<A NAME="422"></A>these sent a hundred ships under the command of King Agamemnon, son of 
<A NAME="423"></A>Atreus. His force was far both finest and most numerous, and in their midst 
<A NAME="424"></A>was the king himself, all glorious in his armour of gleaming bronze- foremost 
<A NAME="425"></A>among the heroes, for he was the greatest king, and had most men under 
<A NAME="426"></A>him.
<A NAME="427"></A><BR><BR>And those that dwelt in Lacedaemon, lying low among the hills, 
<A NAME="428"></A>Pharis, Sparta, with Messe the haunt of doves; Bryseae, Augeae, Amyclae, 
<A NAME="429"></A>and Helos upon the sea; Laas, moreover, and Oetylus; these were led by 
<A NAME="430"></A>Menelaus of the loud battle-cry, brother to Agamemnon, and of them there 
<A NAME="431"></A>were sixty ships, drawn up apart from the others. Among them went Menelaus 
<A NAME="432"></A>himself, strong in zeal, urging his men to fight; for he longed to avenge 
<A NAME="433"></A>the toil and sorrow that he had suffered for the sake of 
<A NAME="434"></A>Helen.
<A NAME="435"></A><BR><BR>The men of Pylos and Arene, and Thryum where is the ford of the 
<A NAME="436"></A>river Alpheus; strong Aipy, Cyparisseis, and Amphigenea; Pteleum, Helos, 
<A NAME="437"></A>and Dorium, where the Muses met Thamyris, and stilled his minstrelsy for 
<A NAME="438"></A>ever. He was returning from Oechalia, where Eurytus lived and reigned, 
<A NAME="439"></A>and boasted that he would surpass even the Muses, daughters of aegis-bearing 
<A NAME="440"></A>Jove, if they should sing against him; whereon they were angry, and maimed 
<A NAME="441"></A>him. They robbed him of his divine power of song, and thenceforth he could 
<A NAME="442"></A>strike the lyre no more. These were commanded by Nestor, knight of Gerene, 
<A NAME="443"></A>and with him there came ninety ships.
<A NAME="444"></A><BR><BR>And those that held Arcadia, under the high mountain of Cyllene, 
<A NAME="445"></A>near the tomb of Aepytus, where the people fight hand to hand; the men 
<A NAME="446"></A>of Pheneus also, and Orchomenus rich in flocks; of Rhipae, Stratie, and 
<A NAME="447"></A>bleak Enispe; of Tegea and fair Mantinea; of Stymphelus and Parrhasia; 
<A NAME="448"></A>of these King Agapenor son of Ancaeus was commander, and they had sixty 
<A NAME="449"></A>ships. Many Arcadians, good soldiers, came in each one of them, but Agamemnon 
<A NAME="450"></A>found them the ships in which to cross the sea, for they were not a people 
<A NAME="451"></A>that occupied their business upon the waters.
<A NAME="452"></A><BR><BR>The men, moreover, of Buprasium and of Elis, so much of it as is 
<A NAME="453"></A>enclosed between Hyrmine, Myrsinus upon the sea-shore, the rock Olene and 
<A NAME="454"></A>Alesium. These had four leaders, and each of them had ten ships, with many 
<A NAME="455"></A>Epeans on board. Their captains were Amphimachus and Thalpius- the one, 
<A NAME="456"></A>son of Cteatus, and the other, of Eurytus- both of the race of Actor. The 
<A NAME="457"></A>two others were Diores, son of Amarynces, and Polyxenus, son of King Agasthenes, 
<A NAME="458"></A>son of Augeas.
<A NAME="459"></A><BR><BR>And those of Dulichium with the sacred Echinean islands, who dwelt 
<A NAME="460"></A>beyond the sea off Elis; these were led by Meges, peer of Mars, and the 
<A NAME="461"></A>son of valiant Phyleus, dear to Jove, who quarrelled with his father, and 
<A NAME="462"></A>went to settle in Dulichium. With him there came forty 
<A NAME="463"></A>ships.
<A NAME="464"></A><BR><BR>Ulysses led the brave Cephallenians, who held Ithaca, Neritum with 
<A NAME="465"></A>its forests, Crocylea, rugged Aegilips, Samos and Zacynthus, with the mainland 
<A NAME="466"></A>also that was over against the islands. These were led by Ulysses, peer 
<A NAME="467"></A>of Jove in counsel, and with him there came twelve ships.
<A NAME="468"></A><BR><BR>Thoas, son of Andraemon, commanded the Aetolians, who dwelt in 
<A NAME="469"></A>Pleuron, Olenus, Pylene, Chalcis by the sea, and rocky Calydon, for the 
<A NAME="470"></A>great king Oeneus had now no sons living, and was himself dead, as was 
<A NAME="471"></A>also golden-haired Meleager, who had been set over the Aetolians to be 
<A NAME="472"></A>their king. And with Thoas there came forty ships.
<A NAME="473"></A><BR><BR>The famous spearsman Idomeneus led the Cretans, who held Cnossus, 
<A NAME="474"></A>and the well-walled city of Gortys; Lyctus also, Miletus and Lycastus that 
<A NAME="475"></A>lies upon the chalk; the populous towns of Phaestus and Rhytium, with the 
<A NAME="476"></A>other peoples that dwelt in the hundred cities of Crete. All these were 
<A NAME="477"></A>led by Idomeneus, and by Meriones, peer of murderous Mars. And with these 
<A NAME="478"></A>there came eighty ships.
<A NAME="479"></A><BR><BR>Tlepolemus, son of Hercules, a man both brave and large of stature, 
<A NAME="480"></A>brought nine ships of lordly warriors from Rhodes. These dwelt in Rhodes 
<A NAME="481"></A>which is divided among the three cities of Lindus, Ielysus, and Cameirus, 
<A NAME="482"></A>that lies upon the chalk. These were commanded by Tlepolemus, son of Hercules 
<A NAME="483"></A>by Astyochea, whom he had carried off from Ephyra, on the river Selleis, 
<A NAME="484"></A>after sacking many cities of valiant warriors. When Tlepolemus grew up, 
<A NAME="485"></A>he killed his father's uncle Licymnius, who had been a famous warrior in 
<A NAME="486"></A>his time, but was then grown old. On this he built himself a fleet, gathered 
<A NAME="487"></A>a great following, and fled beyond the sea, for he was menaced by the other 
<A NAME="488"></A>sons and grandsons of Hercules. After a voyage. during which he suffered 
<A NAME="489"></A>great hardship, he came to Rhodes, where the people divided into three 
<A NAME="490"></A>communities, according to their tribes, and were dearly loved by Jove, 
<A NAME="491"></A>the lord, of gods and men; wherefore the son of Saturn showered down great 
<A NAME="492"></A>riches upon them.
<A NAME="493"></A><BR><BR>And Nireus brought three ships from Syme- Nireus, who was the handsomest 
<A NAME="494"></A>man that came up under Ilius of all the Danaans after the son of Peleus- 
<A NAME="495"></A>but he was a man of no substance, and had but a small 
<A NAME="496"></A>following.
<A NAME="497"></A><BR><BR>And those that held Nisyrus, Crapathus, and Casus, with Cos, the 
<A NAME="498"></A>city of Eurypylus, and the Calydnian islands, these were commanded by Pheidippus 
<A NAME="499"></A>and Antiphus, two sons of King Thessalus the son of Hercules. And with 
<A NAME="500"></A>them there came thirty ships.
<A NAME="501"></A><BR><BR>Those again who held Pelasgic Argos, Alos, Alope, and Trachis; 
<A NAME="502"></A>and those of Phthia and Hellas the land of fair women, who were called 
<A NAME="503"></A>Myrmidons, Hellenes, and Achaeans; these had fifty ships, over which Achilles 
<A NAME="504"></A>was in command. But they now took no part in the war, inasmuch as there 
<A NAME="505"></A>was no one to marshal them; for Achilles stayed by his ships, furious about 
<A NAME="506"></A>the loss of the girl Briseis, whom he had taken from Lyrnessus at his own 
<A NAME="507"></A>great peril, when he had sacked Lyrnessus and Thebe, and had overthrown 
<A NAME="508"></A>Mynes and Epistrophus, sons of king Evenor, son of Selepus. For her sake 
<A NAME="509"></A>Achilles was still grieving, but ere long he was again to join 
<A NAME="510"></A>them.
<A NAME="511"></A><BR><BR>And those that held Phylace and the flowery meadows of Pyrasus, 
<A NAME="512"></A>sanctuary of Ceres; Iton, the mother of sheep; Antrum upon the sea, and 
<A NAME="513"></A>Pteleum that lies upon the grass lands. Of these brave Protesilaus had 
<A NAME="514"></A>been captain while he was yet alive, but he was now lying under the earth. 
<A NAME="515"></A>He had left a wife behind him in Phylace to tear her cheeks in sorrow, 
<A NAME="516"></A>and his house was only half finished, for he was slain by a Dardanian warrior 
<A NAME="517"></A>while leaping foremost of the Achaeans upon the soil of Troy. Still, though 
<A NAME="518"></A>his people mourned their chieftain, they were not without a leader, for 
<A NAME="519"></A>Podarces, of the race of Mars, marshalled them; he was son of Iphiclus, 
<A NAME="520"></A>rich in sheep, who was the son of Phylacus, and he was own brother to Protesilaus, 
<A NAME="521"></A>only younger, Protesilaus being at once the elder and the more valiant. 
<A NAME="522"></A>So the people were not without a leader, though they mourned him whom they 
<A NAME="523"></A>had lost. With him there came forty ships.
<A NAME="524"></A><BR><BR>And those that held Pherae by the Boebean lake, with Boebe, Glaphyrae, 
<A NAME="525"></A>and the populous city of Iolcus, these with their eleven ships were led 
<A NAME="526"></A>by Eumelus, son of Admetus, whom Alcestis bore to him, loveliest of the 
<A NAME="527"></A>daughters of Pelias.
<A NAME="528"></A><BR><BR>And those that held Methone and Thaumacia, with Meliboea and rugged 
<A NAME="529"></A>Olizon, these were led by the skilful archer Philoctetes, and they had 
<A NAME="530"></A>seven ships, each with fifty oarsmen all of them good archers; but Philoctetes 
<A NAME="531"></A>was lying in great pain in the Island of Lemnos, where the sons of the 
<A NAME="532"></A>Achaeans left him, for he had been bitten by a poisonous water snake. There 
<A NAME="533"></A>he lay sick and sorry, and full soon did the Argives come to miss him. 
<A NAME="534"></A>But his people, though they felt his loss were not leaderless, for Medon, 
<A NAME="535"></A>the bastard son of Oileus by Rhene, set them in array.
<A NAME="536"></A><BR><BR>Those, again, of Tricca and the stony region of Ithome, and they 
<A NAME="537"></A>that held Oechalia, the city of Oechalian Eurytus, these were commanded 
<A NAME="538"></A>by the two sons of Aesculapius, skilled in the art of healing, Podalirius 
<A NAME="539"></A>and Machaon. And with them there came thirty ships.
<A NAME="540"></A><BR><BR>The men, moreover, of Ormenius, and by the fountain of Hypereia, 
<A NAME="541"></A>with those that held Asterius, and the white crests of Titanus, these were 
<A NAME="542"></A>led by Eurypylus, the son of Euaemon, and with them there came forty 
<A NAME="543"></A>ships.
<A NAME="544"></A><BR><BR>Those that held Argissa and Gyrtone, Orthe, Elone, and the white 
<A NAME="545"></A>city of Oloosson, of these brave Polypoetes was leader. He was son of Pirithous, 
<A NAME="546"></A>who was son of Jove himself, for Hippodameia bore him to Pirithous on the 
<A NAME="547"></A>day when he took his revenge on the shaggy mountain savages and drove them 
<A NAME="548"></A>from Mt. Pelion to the Aithices. But Polypoetes was not sole in command, 
<A NAME="549"></A>for with him was Leonteus, of the race of Mars, who was son of Coronus, 
<A NAME="550"></A>the son of Caeneus. And with these there came forty 
<A NAME="551"></A>ships.
<A NAME="552"></A><BR><BR>Guneus brought two and twenty ships from Cyphus, and he was followed 
<A NAME="553"></A>by the Enienes and the valiant Peraebi, who dwelt about wintry Dodona, 
<A NAME="554"></A>and held the lands round the lovely river Titaresius, which sends its waters 
<A NAME="555"></A>into the Peneus. They do not mingle with the silver eddies of the Peneus, 
<A NAME="556"></A>but flow on the top of them like oil; for the Titaresius is a branch of 
<A NAME="557"></A>dread Orcus and of the river Styx.
<A NAME="558"></A><BR><BR>Of the Magnetes, Prothous son of Tenthredon was commander. They 
<A NAME="559"></A>were they that dwelt about the river Peneus and Mt. Pelion. Prothous, fleet 
<A NAME="560"></A>of foot, was their leader, and with him there came forty 
<A NAME="561"></A>ships.
<A NAME="562"></A><BR><BR>Such were the chiefs and princes of the Danaans. Who, then, O Muse, 
<A NAME="563"></A>was the foremost, whether man or horse, among those that followed after 
<A NAME="564"></A>the sons of Atreus?
<A NAME="565"></A><BR><BR>Of the horses, those of the son of Pheres were by far the finest. 
<A NAME="566"></A>They were driven by Eumelus, and were as fleet as birds. They were of the 
<A NAME="567"></A>same age and colour, and perfectly matched in height. Apollo, of the silver 
<A NAME="568"></A>bow, had bred them in Perea- both of them mares, and terrible as Mars in 
<A NAME="569"></A>battle. Of the men, Ajax, son of Telamon, was much the foremost so long 
<A NAME="570"></A>as Achilles' anger lasted, for Achilles excelled him greatly and he had 
<A NAME="571"></A>also better horses; but Achilles was now holding aloof at his ships by 
<A NAME="572"></A>reason of his quarrel with Agamemnon, and his people passed their time 
<A NAME="573"></A>upon the sea shore, throwing discs or aiming with spears at a mark, and 
<A NAME="574"></A>in archery. Their horses stood each by his own chariot, champing lotus 
<A NAME="575"></A>and wild celery. The chariots were housed under cover, but their owners, 
<A NAME="576"></A>for lack of leadership, wandered hither and thither about the host and 
<A NAME="577"></A>went not forth to fight.
<A NAME="578"></A><BR><BR>Thus marched the host like a consuming fire, and the earth groaned 
<A NAME="579"></A>beneath them when the lord of thunder is angry and lashes the land about 
<A NAME="580"></A>Typhoeus among the Arimi, where they say Typhoeus lies. Even so did the 
<A NAME="581"></A>earth groan beneath them as they sped over the plain.
<A NAME="582"></A><BR><BR>And now Iris, fleet as the wind, was sent by Jove to tell the bad 
<A NAME="583"></A>news among the Trojans. They were gathered in assembly, old and young, 
<A NAME="584"></A>at Priam's gates, and Iris came close up to Priam, speaking with the voice 
<A NAME="585"></A>of Priam's son Polites, who, being fleet of foot, was stationed as watchman 
<A NAME="586"></A>for the Trojans on the tomb of old Aesyetes, to look out for any sally 
<A NAME="587"></A>of the Achaeans. In his likeness Iris spoke, saying, "Old man, you talk 
<A NAME="588"></A>idly, as in time of peace, while war is at hand. I have been in many a 
<A NAME="589"></A>battle, but never yet saw such a host as is now advancing. They are crossing 
<A NAME="590"></A>the plain to attack the city as thick as leaves or as the sands of the 
<A NAME="591"></A>sea. Hector, I charge you above all others, do as I say. There are many 
<A NAME="592"></A>allies dispersed about the city of Priam from distant places and speaking 
<A NAME="593"></A>divers tongues. Therefore, let each chief give orders to his own people, 
<A NAME="594"></A>setting them severally in array and leading them forth to 
<A NAME="595"></A>battle."
<A NAME="596"></A><BR><BR>Thus she spoke, but Hector knew that it was the goddess, and at 
<A NAME="597"></A>once broke up the assembly. The men flew to arms; all the gates were opened, 
<A NAME="598"></A>and the people thronged through them, horse and foot, with the tramp as 
<A NAME="599"></A>of a great multitude.
<A NAME="600"></A><BR><BR>Now there is a high mound before the city, rising by itself upon 
<A NAME="601"></A>the plain. Men call it Batieia, but the gods know that it is the tomb of 
<A NAME="602"></A>lithe Myrine. Here the Trojans and their allies divided their 
<A NAME="603"></A>forces.
<A NAME="604"></A><BR><BR>Priam's son, great Hector of the gleaming helmet, commanded the 
<A NAME="605"></A>Trojans, and with him were arrayed by far the greater number and most valiant 
<A NAME="606"></A>of those who were longing for the fray.
<A NAME="607"></A><BR><BR>The Dardanians were led by brave Aeneas, whom Venus bore to Anchises, 
<A NAME="608"></A>when she, goddess though she was, had lain with him upon the mountain slopes 
<A NAME="609"></A>of Ida. He was not alone, for with him were the two sons of Antenor, Archilochus 
<A NAME="610"></A>and Acamas, both skilled in all the arts of war.
<A NAME="611"></A><BR><BR>They that dwelt in Telea under the lowest spurs of Mt. Ida, men 
<A NAME="612"></A>of substance, who drink the limpid waters of the Aesepus, and are of Trojan 
<A NAME="613"></A>blood- these were led by Pandarus son of Lycaon, whom Apollo had taught 
<A NAME="614"></A>to use the bow.
<A NAME="615"></A><BR><BR>They that held Adresteia and the land of Apaesus, with Pityeia, 
<A NAME="616"></A>and the high mountain of Tereia- these were led by Adrestus and Amphius, 
<A NAME="617"></A>whose breastplate was of linen. These were the sons of Merops of Percote, 
<A NAME="618"></A>who excelled in all kinds of divination. He told them not to take part 
<A NAME="619"></A>in the war, but they gave him no heed, for fate lured them to 
<A NAME="620"></A>destruction.
<A NAME="621"></A><BR><BR>They that dwelt about Percote and Practius, with Sestos, Abydos, 
<A NAME="622"></A>and Arisbe- these were led by Asius, son of Hyrtacus, a brave commander- 
<A NAME="623"></A>Asius, the son of Hyrtacus, whom his powerful dark bay steeds, of the breed 
<A NAME="624"></A>that comes from the river Selleis, had brought from 
<A NAME="625"></A>Arisbe.
<A NAME="626"></A><BR><BR>Hippothous led the tribes of Pelasgian spearsmen, who dwelt in 
<A NAME="627"></A>fertile Larissa- Hippothous, and Pylaeus of the race of Mars, two sons 
<A NAME="628"></A>of the Pelasgian Lethus, son of Teutamus.
<A NAME="629"></A><BR><BR>Acamas and the warrior Peirous commanded the Thracians and those 
<A NAME="630"></A>that came from beyond the mighty stream of the Hellespont.
<A NAME="631"></A><BR><BR>Euphemus, son of Troezenus, the son of Ceos, was captain of the 
<A NAME="632"></A>Ciconian spearsmen.
<A NAME="633"></A><BR><BR>Pyraechmes led the Paeonian archers from distant Amydon, by the 
<A NAME="634"></A>broad waters of the river Axius, the fairest that flow upon the 
<A NAME="635"></A>earth.
<A NAME="636"></A><BR><BR>The Paphlagonians were commanded by stout-hearted Pylaemanes from 
<A NAME="637"></A>Enetae, where the mules run wild in herds. These were they that held Cytorus 
<A NAME="638"></A>and the country round Sesamus, with the cities by the river Parthenius, 
<A NAME="639"></A>Cromna, Aegialus, and lofty Erithini.
<A NAME="640"></A><BR><BR>Odius and Epistrophus were captains over the Halizoni from distant 
<A NAME="641"></A>Alybe, where there are mines of silver.
<A NAME="642"></A><BR><BR>Chromis, and Ennomus the augur, led the Mysians, but his skill 
<A NAME="643"></A>in augury availed not to save him from destruction, for he fell by the 
<A NAME="644"></A>hand of the fleet descendant of Aeacus in the river, where he slew others 
<A NAME="645"></A>also of the Trojans.
<A NAME="646"></A><BR><BR>Phorcys, again, and noble Ascanius led the Phrygians from the far 
<A NAME="647"></A>country of Ascania, and both were eager for the fray.
<A NAME="648"></A><BR><BR>Mesthles and Antiphus commanded the Meonians, sons of Talaemenes, 
<A NAME="649"></A>born to him of the Gygaean lake. These led the Meonians, who dwelt under 
<A NAME="650"></A>Mt. Tmolus.
<A NAME="651"></A><BR><BR>Nastes led the Carians, men of a strange speech. These held Miletus 
<A NAME="652"></A>and the wooded mountain of Phthires, with the water of the river Maeander 
<A NAME="653"></A>and the lofty crests of Mt. Mycale. These were commanded by Nastes and 
<A NAME="654"></A>Amphimachus, the brave sons of Nomion. He came into the fight with gold 
<A NAME="655"></A>about him, like a girl; fool that he was, his gold was of no avail to save 
<A NAME="656"></A>him, for he fell in the river by the hand of the fleet descendant of Aeacus, 
<A NAME="657"></A>and Achilles bore away his gold.
<A NAME="658"></A><BR><BR>Sarpedon and Glaucus led the Lycians from their distant land, by 
<A NAME="659"></A>the eddying waters of the Xanthus.
