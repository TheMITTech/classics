<A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A>Thence we went on to the Aeoli island where lives Aeolus son of Hippotas, 
<A NAME="11"></A>dear to the immortal gods. It is an island that floats (as it were) upon 
<A NAME="12"></A>the sea, iron bound with a wall that girds it. Now, Aeolus has six daughters 
<A NAME="13"></A>and six lusty sons, so he made the sons marry the daughters, and they all 
<A NAME="14"></A>live with their dear father and mother, feasting and enjoying every conceivable 
<A NAME="15"></A>kind of luxury. All day long the atmosphere of the house is loaded with 
<A NAME="16"></A>the savour of roasting meats till it groans again, yard and all; but by 
<A NAME="17"></A>night they sleep on their well-made bedsteads, each with his own wife between 
<A NAME="18"></A>the blankets. These were the people among whom we had now 
<A NAME="19"></A>come.
<A NAME="20"></A><BR><BR>"Aeolus entertained me for a whole month asking me questions all 
<A NAME="21"></A>the time about Troy, the Argive fleet, and the return of the Achaeans. 
<A NAME="22"></A>I told him exactly how everything had happened, and when I said I must 
<A NAME="23"></A>go, and asked him to further me on my way, he made no sort of difficulty, 
<A NAME="24"></A>but set about doing so at once. Moreover, he flayed me a prime ox-hide 
<A NAME="25"></A>to hold the ways of the roaring winds, which he shut up in the hide as 
<A NAME="26"></A>in a sack- for Jove had made him captain over the winds, and he could stir 
<A NAME="27"></A>or still each one of them according to his own pleasure. He put the sack 
<A NAME="28"></A>in the ship and bound the mouth so tightly with a silver thread that not 
<A NAME="29"></A>even a breath of a side-wind could blow from any quarter. The West wind 
<A NAME="30"></A>which was fair for us did he alone let blow as it chose; but it all came 
<A NAME="31"></A>to nothing, for we were lost through our own folly.
<A NAME="32"></A><BR><BR>"Nine days and nine nights did we sail, and on the tenth day our 
<A NAME="33"></A>native land showed on the horizon. We got so close in that we could see 
<A NAME="34"></A>the stubble fires burning, and I, being then dead beat, fell into a light 
<A NAME="35"></A>sleep, for I had never let the rudder out of my own hands, that we might 
<A NAME="36"></A>get home the faster. On this the men fell to talking among themselves, 
<A NAME="37"></A>and said I was bringing back gold and silver in the sack that Aeolus had 
<A NAME="38"></A>given me. 'Bless my heart,' would one turn to his neighbour, saying, 'how 
<A NAME="39"></A>this man gets honoured and makes friends to whatever city or country he 
<A NAME="40"></A>may go. See what fine prizes he is taking home from Troy, while we, who 
<A NAME="41"></A>have travelled just as far as he has, come back with hands as empty as 
<A NAME="42"></A>we set out with- and now Aeolus has given him ever so much more. Quick- 
<A NAME="43"></A>let us see what it all is, and how much gold and silver there is in the 
<A NAME="44"></A>sack he gave him.'
<A NAME="45"></A><BR><BR>"Thus they talked and evil counsels prevailed. They loosed the 
<A NAME="46"></A>sack, whereupon the wind flew howling forth and raised a storm that carried 
<A NAME="47"></A>us weeping out to sea and away from our own country. Then I awoke, and 
<A NAME="48"></A>knew not whether to throw myself into the sea or to live on and make the 
<A NAME="49"></A>best of it; but I bore it, covered myself up, and lay down in the ship, 
<A NAME="50"></A>while the men lamented bitterly as the fierce winds bore our fleet back 
<A NAME="51"></A>to the Aeolian island.
<A NAME="52"></A><BR><BR>"When we reached it we went ashore to take in water, and dined 
<A NAME="53"></A>hard by the ships. Immediately after dinner I took a herald and one of 
<A NAME="54"></A>my men and went straight to the house of Aeolus, where I found him feasting 
<A NAME="55"></A>with his wife and family; so we sat down as suppliants on the threshold. 
<A NAME="56"></A>They were astounded when they saw us and said, 'Ulysses, what brings you 
<A NAME="57"></A>here? What god has been ill-treating you? We took great pains to further 
<A NAME="58"></A>you on your way home to Ithaca, or wherever it was that you wanted to go 
<A NAME="59"></A>to.'
<A NAME="60"></A><BR><BR>"Thus did they speak, but I answered sorrowfully, 'My men have 
<A NAME="61"></A>undone me; they, and cruel sleep, have ruined me. My friends, mend me this 
<A NAME="62"></A>mischief, for you can if you will.'
<A NAME="63"></A><BR><BR>"I spoke as movingly as I could, but they said nothing, till their 
<A NAME="64"></A>father answered, 'Vilest of mankind, get you gone at once out of the island; 
<A NAME="65"></A>him whom heaven hates will I in no wise help. Be off, for you come here 
<A NAME="66"></A>as one abhorred of heaven. "And with these words he sent me sorrowing from 
<A NAME="67"></A>his door.
<A NAME="68"></A><BR><BR>"Thence we sailed sadly on till the men were worn out with long 
<A NAME="69"></A>and fruitless rowing, for there was no longer any wind to help them. Six 
<A NAME="70"></A>days, night and day did we toil, and on the seventh day we reached the 
<A NAME="71"></A>rocky stronghold of Lamus- Telepylus, the city of the Laestrygonians, where 
<A NAME="72"></A>the shepherd who is driving in his sheep and goats [to be milked] salutes 
<A NAME="73"></A>him who is driving out his flock [to feed] and this last answers the salute. 
<A NAME="74"></A>In that country a man who could do without sleep might earn double wages, 
<A NAME="75"></A>one as a herdsman of cattle, and another as a shepherd, for they work much 
<A NAME="76"></A>the same by night as they do by day.
<A NAME="77"></A><BR><BR>"When we reached the harbour we found it land-locked under steep 
<A NAME="78"></A>cliffs, with a narrow entrance between two headlands. My captains took 
<A NAME="79"></A>all their ships inside, and made them fast close to one another, for there 
<A NAME="80"></A>was never so much as a breath of wind inside, but it was always dead calm. 
<A NAME="81"></A>I kept my own ship outside, and moored it to a rock at the very end of 
<A NAME="82"></A>the point; then I climbed a high rock to reconnoitre, but could see no 
<A NAME="83"></A>sign neither of man nor cattle, only some smoke rising from the ground. 
<A NAME="84"></A>So I sent two of my company with an attendant to find out what sort of 
<A NAME="85"></A>people the inhabitants were.
<A NAME="86"></A><BR><BR>"The men when they got on shore followed a level road by which 
<A NAME="87"></A>the people draw their firewood from the mountains into the town, till presently 
<A NAME="88"></A>they met a young woman who had come outside to fetch water, and who was 
<A NAME="89"></A>daughter to a Laestrygonian named Antiphates. She was going to the fountain 
<A NAME="90"></A>Artacia from which the people bring in their water, and when my men had 
<A NAME="91"></A>come close up to her, they asked her who the king of that country might 
<A NAME="92"></A>be, and over what kind of people he ruled; so she directed them to her 
<A NAME="93"></A>father's house, but when they got there they found his wife to be a giantess 
<A NAME="94"></A>as huge as a mountain, and they were horrified at the sight of 
<A NAME="95"></A>her.
<A NAME="96"></A><BR><BR>"She at once called her husband Antiphates from the place of assembly, 
<A NAME="97"></A>and forthwith he set about killing my men. He snatched up one of them, 
<A NAME="98"></A>and began to make his dinner off him then and there, whereon the other 
<A NAME="99"></A>two ran back to the ships as fast as ever they could. But Antiphates raised 
<A NAME="100"></A>a hue and cry after them, and thousands of sturdy Laestrygonians sprang 
<A NAME="101"></A>up from every quarter- ogres, not men. They threw vast rocks at us from 
<A NAME="102"></A>the cliffs as though they had been mere stones, and I heard the horrid 
<A NAME="103"></A>sound of the ships crunching up against one another, and the death cries 
<A NAME="104"></A>of my men, as the Laestrygonians speared them like fishes and took them 
<A NAME="105"></A>home to eat them. While they were thus killing my men within the harbour 
<A NAME="106"></A>I drew my sword, cut the cable of my own ship, and told my men to row with 
<A NAME="107"></A>alf their might if they too would not fare like the rest; so they laid 
<A NAME="108"></A>out for their lives, and we were thankful enough when we got into open 
<A NAME="109"></A>water out of reach of the rocks they hurled at us. As for the others there 
<A NAME="110"></A>was not one of them left.
<A NAME="111"></A><BR><BR>"Thence we sailed sadly on, glad to have escaped death, though 
<A NAME="112"></A>we had lost our comrades, and came to the Aeaean island, where Circe lives 
<A NAME="113"></A>a great and cunning goddess who is own sister to the magician Aeetes- for 
<A NAME="114"></A>they are both children of the sun by Perse, who is daughter to Oceanus. 
<A NAME="115"></A>We brought our ship into a safe harbour without a word, for some god guided 
<A NAME="116"></A>us thither, and having landed we there for two days and two nights, worn 
<A NAME="117"></A>out in body and mind. When the morning of the third day came I took my 
<A NAME="118"></A>spear and my sword, and went away from the ship to reconnoitre, and see 
<A NAME="119"></A>if I could discover signs of human handiwork, or hear the sound of voices. 
<A NAME="120"></A>Climbing to the top of a high look-out I espied the smoke of Circe's house 
<A NAME="121"></A>rising upwards amid a dense forest of trees, and when I saw this I doubted 
<A NAME="122"></A>whether, having seen the smoke, I would not go on at once and find out 
<A NAME="123"></A>more, but in the end I deemed it best to go back to the ship, give the 
<A NAME="124"></A>men their dinners, and send some of them instead of going 
<A NAME="125"></A>myself.
<A NAME="126"></A><BR><BR>"When I had nearly got back to the ship some god took pity upon 
<A NAME="127"></A>my solitude, and sent a fine antlered stag right into the middle of my 
<A NAME="128"></A>path. He was coming down his pasture in the forest to drink of the river, 
<A NAME="129"></A>for the heat of the sun drove him, and as he passed I struck him in the 
<A NAME="130"></A>middle of the back; the bronze point of the spear went clean through him, 
<A NAME="131"></A>and he lay groaning in the dust until the life went out of him. Then I 
<A NAME="132"></A>set my foot upon him, drew my spear from the wound, and laid it down; I 
<A NAME="133"></A>also gathered rough grass and rushes and twisted them into a fathom or 
<A NAME="134"></A>so of good stout rope, with which I bound the four feet of the noble creature 
<A NAME="135"></A>together; having so done I hung him round my neck and walked back to the 
<A NAME="136"></A>ship leaning upon my spear, for the stag was much too big for me to be 
<A NAME="137"></A>able to carry him on my shoulder, steadying him with one hand. As I threw 
<A NAME="138"></A>him down in front of the ship, I called the men and spoke cheeringly man 
<A NAME="139"></A>by man to each of them. 'Look here my friends,' said I, 'we are not going 
<A NAME="140"></A>to die so much before our time after all, and at any rate we will not starve 
<A NAME="141"></A>so long as we have got something to eat and drink on board.' On this they 
<A NAME="142"></A>uncovered their heads upon the sea shore and admired the stag, for he was 
<A NAME="143"></A>indeed a splendid fellow. Then, when they had feasted their eyes upon him 
<A NAME="144"></A>sufficiently, they washed their hands and began to cook him for 
<A NAME="145"></A>dinner.
<A NAME="146"></A><BR><BR>"Thus through the livelong day to the going down of the sun we 
<A NAME="147"></A>stayed there eating and drinking our fill, but when the sun went down and 
<A NAME="148"></A>it came on dark, we camped upon the sea shore. When the child of morning, 
<A NAME="149"></A>fingered Dawn, appeared, I called a council and said, 'My friends, we are 
<A NAME="150"></A>in very great difficulties; listen therefore to me. We have no idea where 
<A NAME="151"></A>the sun either sets or rises, so that we do not even know East from West. 
<A NAME="152"></A>I see no way out of it; nevertheless, we must try and find one. We are 
<A NAME="153"></A>certainly on an island, for I went as high as I could this morning, and 
<A NAME="154"></A>saw the sea reaching all round it to the horizon; it lies low, but towards 
<A NAME="155"></A>the middle I saw smoke rising from out of a thick forest of 
<A NAME="156"></A>trees.'
<A NAME="157"></A><BR><BR>"Their hearts sank as they heard me, for they remembered how they 
<A NAME="158"></A>had been treated by the Laestrygonian Antiphates, and by the savage ogre 
<A NAME="159"></A>Polyphemus. They wept bitterly in their dismay, but there was nothing to 
<A NAME="160"></A>be got by crying, so I divided them into two companies and set a captain 
<A NAME="161"></A>over each; I gave one company to Eurylochus, while I took command of the 
<A NAME="162"></A>other myself. Then we cast lots in a helmet, and the lot fell upon Eurylochus; 
<A NAME="163"></A>so he set out with his twenty-two men, and they wept, as also did we who 
<A NAME="164"></A>were left behind.
<A NAME="165"></A><BR><BR>"When they reached Circe's house they found it built of cut stones, 
<A NAME="166"></A>on a site that could be seen from far, in the middle of the forest. There 
<A NAME="167"></A>were wild mountain wolves and lions prowling all round it- poor bewitched 
<A NAME="168"></A>creatures whom she had tamed by her enchantments and drugged into subjection. 
<A NAME="169"></A>They did not attack my men, but wagged their great tails, fawned upon them, 
<A NAME="170"></A>and rubbed their noses lovingly against them. As hounds crowd round their 
<A NAME="171"></A>master when they see him coming from dinner- for they know he will bring 
<A NAME="172"></A>them something- even so did these wolves and lions with their great claws 
<A NAME="173"></A>fawn upon my men, but the men were terribly frightened at seeing such strange 
<A NAME="174"></A>creatures. Presently they reached the gates of the goddess's house, and 
<A NAME="175"></A>as they stood there they could hear Circe within, singing most beautifully 
<A NAME="176"></A>as she worked at her loom, making a web so fine, so soft, and of such dazzling 
<A NAME="177"></A>colours as no one but a goddess could weave. On this Polites, whom I valued 
<A NAME="178"></A>and trusted more than any other of my men, said, 'There is some one inside 
<A NAME="179"></A>working at a loom and singing most beautifully; the whole place resounds 
<A NAME="180"></A>with it, let us call her and see whether she is woman or 
<A NAME="181"></A>goddess.'
<A NAME="182"></A><BR><BR>"They called her and she came down, unfastened the door, and bade 
<A NAME="183"></A>them enter. They, thinking no evil, followed her, all except Eurylochus, 
<A NAME="184"></A>who suspected mischief and stayed outside. When she had got them into her 
<A NAME="185"></A>house, she set them upon benches and seats and mixed them a mess with cheese, 
<A NAME="186"></A>honey, meal, and Pramnian but she drugged it with wicked poisons to make 
<A NAME="187"></A>them forget their homes, and when they had drunk she turned them into pigs 
<A NAME="188"></A>by a stroke of her wand, and shut them up in her pigsties. They were like 
<A NAME="189"></A>pigs-head, hair, and all, and they grunted just as pigs do; but their senses 
<A NAME="190"></A>were the same as before, and they remembered everything.
<A NAME="191"></A><BR><BR>"Thus then were they shut up squealing, and Circe threw them some 
<A NAME="192"></A>acorns and beech masts such as pigs eat, but Eurylochus hurried back to 
<A NAME="193"></A>tell me about the sad fate of our comrades. He was so overcome with dismay 
<A NAME="194"></A>that though he tried to speak he could find no words to do so; his eyes 
<A NAME="195"></A>filled with tears and he could only sob and sigh, till at last we forced 
<A NAME="196"></A>his story out of him, and he told us what had happened to the 
<A NAME="197"></A>others.
<A NAME="198"></A><BR><BR>"'We went,' said he, as you told us, through the forest, and in 
<A NAME="199"></A>the middle of it there was a fine house built with cut stones in a place 
<A NAME="200"></A>that could be seen from far. There we found a woman, or else she was a 
<A NAME="201"></A>goddess, working at her loom and singing sweetly; so the men shouted to 
<A NAME="202"></A>her and called her, whereon she at once came down, opened the door, and 
<A NAME="203"></A>invited us in. The others did not suspect any mischief so they followed 
<A NAME="204"></A>her into the house, but I stayed where I was, for I thought there might 
<A NAME="205"></A>be some treachery. From that moment I saw them no more, for not one of 
<A NAME="206"></A>them ever came out, though I sat a long time watching for 
<A NAME="207"></A>them.'
<A NAME="208"></A><BR><BR>"Then I took my sword of bronze and slung it over my shoulders; 
<A NAME="209"></A>I also took my bow, and told Eurylochus to come back with me and show me 
<A NAME="210"></A>the way. But he laid hold of me with both his hands and spoke piteously, 
<A NAME="211"></A>saying, 'Sir, do not force me to go with you, but let me stay here, for 
<A NAME="212"></A>I know you will not bring one of them back with you, nor even return alive 
<A NAME="213"></A>yourself; let us rather see if we cannot escape at any rate with the few 
<A NAME="214"></A>that are left us, for we may still save our lives.'
<A NAME="215"></A><BR><BR>"'Stay where you are, then, 'answered I, 'eating and drinking at 
<A NAME="216"></A>the ship, but I must go, for I am most urgently bound to do 
<A NAME="217"></A>so.'
<A NAME="218"></A><BR><BR>"With this I left the ship and went up inland. When I got through 
<A NAME="219"></A>the charmed grove, and was near the great house of the enchantress Circe, 
<A NAME="220"></A>I met Mercury with his golden wand, disguised as a young man in the hey-day 
<A NAME="221"></A>of his youth and beauty with the down just coming upon his face. He came 
<A NAME="222"></A>up to me and took my hand within his own, saying, 'My poor unhappy man, 
<A NAME="223"></A>whither are you going over this mountain top, alone and without knowing 
<A NAME="224"></A>the way? Your men are shut up in Circe's pigsties, like so many wild boars 
<A NAME="225"></A>in their lairs. You surely do not fancy that you can set them free? I can 
<A NAME="226"></A>tell you that you will never get back and will have to stay there with 
<A NAME="227"></A>the rest of them. But never mind, I will protect you and get you out of 
<A NAME="228"></A>your difficulty. Take this herb, which is one of great virtue, and keep 
<A NAME="229"></A>it about you when you go to Circe's house, it will be a talisman to you 
<A NAME="230"></A>against every kind of mischief.
<A NAME="231"></A><BR><BR>"'And I will tell you of all the wicked witchcraft that Circe will 
<A NAME="232"></A>try to practise upon you. She will mix a mess for you to drink, and she 
<A NAME="233"></A>will drug the meal with which she makes it, but she will not be able to 
<A NAME="234"></A>charm you, for the virtue of the herb that I shall give you will prevent 
<A NAME="235"></A>her spells from working. I will tell you all about it. When Circe strikes 
<A NAME="236"></A>you with her wand, draw your sword and spring upon her as though you were 
<A NAME="237"></A>goings to kill her. She will then be frightened and will desire you to 
<A NAME="238"></A>go to bed with her; on this you must not point blank refuse her, for you 
<A NAME="239"></A>want her to set your companions free, and to take good care also of yourself, 
<A NAME="240"></A>but you make her swear solemnly by all the blessed that she will plot no 
<A NAME="241"></A>further mischief against you, or else when she has got you naked she will 
<A NAME="242"></A>unman you and make you fit for nothing.'
<A NAME="243"></A><BR><BR>"As he spoke he pulled the herb out of the ground an showed me 
<A NAME="244"></A>what it was like. The root was black, while the flower was as white as 
<A NAME="245"></A>milk; the gods call it Moly, and mortal men cannot uproot it, but the gods 
<A NAME="246"></A>can do whatever they like.
<A NAME="247"></A><BR><BR>"Then Mercury went back to high Olympus passing over the wooded 
<A NAME="248"></A>island; but I fared onward to the house of Circe, and my heart was clouded 
<A NAME="249"></A>with care as I walked along. When I got to the gates I stood there and 
<A NAME="250"></A>called the goddess, and as soon as she heard me she came down, opened the 
<A NAME="251"></A>door, and asked me to come in; so I followed her- much troubled in my mind. 
<A NAME="252"></A>She set me on a richly decorated seat inlaid with silver, there was a footstool 
<A NAME="253"></A>also under my feet, and she mixed a mess in a golden goblet for me to drink; 
<A NAME="254"></A>but she drugged it, for she meant me mischief. When she had given it me, 
<A NAME="255"></A>and I had drunk it without its charming me, she struck she, struck me with 
<A NAME="256"></A>her wand. 'There now,' she cried, 'be off to the pigsty, and make your 
<A NAME="257"></A>lair with the rest of them.'
<A NAME="258"></A><BR><BR>"But I rushed at her with my sword drawn as though I would kill 
<A NAME="259"></A>her, whereon she fell with a loud scream, clasped my knees, and spoke piteously, 
<A NAME="260"></A>saying, 'Who and whence are you? from what place and people have you come? 
<A NAME="261"></A>How can it be that my drugs have no power to charm you? Never yet was any 
<A NAME="262"></A>man able to stand so much as a taste of the herb I gave you; you must be 
<A NAME="263"></A>spell-proof; surely you can be none other than the bold hero Ulysses, who 
<A NAME="264"></A>Mercury always said would come here some day with his ship while on his 
<A NAME="265"></A>way home form Troy; so be it then; sheathe your sword and let us go to 
<A NAME="266"></A>bed, that we may make friends and learn to trust each 
<A NAME="267"></A>other.'
<A NAME="268"></A><BR><BR>"And I answered, 'Circe, how can you expect me to be friendly with 
<A NAME="269"></A>you when you have just been turning all my men into pigs? And now that 
<A NAME="270"></A>you have got me here myself, you mean me mischief when you ask me to go 
<A NAME="271"></A>to bed with you, and will unman me and make me fit for nothing. I shall 
<A NAME="272"></A>certainly not consent to go to bed with you unless you will first take 
<A NAME="273"></A>your solemn oath to plot no further harm against me.'
<A NAME="274"></A><BR><BR>"So she swore at once as I had told her, and when she had completed 
<A NAME="275"></A>her oath then I went to bed with her.
<A NAME="276"></A><BR><BR>"Meanwhile her four servants, who are her housemaids, set about 
<A NAME="277"></A>their work. They are the children of the groves and fountains, and of the 
<A NAME="278"></A>holy waters that run down into the sea. One of them spread a fair purple 
<A NAME="279"></A>cloth over a seat, and laid a carpet underneath it. Another brought tables 
<A NAME="280"></A>of silver up to the seats, and set them with baskets of gold. A third mixed 
<A NAME="281"></A>some sweet wine with water in a silver bowl and put golden cups upon the 
<A NAME="282"></A>tables, while the fourth she brought in water and set it to boil in a large 
<A NAME="283"></A>cauldron over a good fire which she had lighted. When the water in the 
<A NAME="284"></A>cauldron was boiling, she poured cold into it till it was just as I liked 
<A NAME="285"></A>it, and then she set me in a bath and began washing me from the cauldron 
<A NAME="286"></A>about the head and shoulders, to take the tire and stiffness out of my 
<A NAME="287"></A>limbs. As soon as she had done washing me and anointing me with oil, she 
<A NAME="288"></A>arrayed me in a good cloak and shirt and led me to a richly decorated seat 
<A NAME="289"></A>inlaid with silver; there was a footstool also under my feet. A maid servant 
<A NAME="290"></A>then brought me water in a beautiful golden ewer and poured it into a silver 
<A NAME="291"></A>basin for me to wash my hands, and she drew a clean table beside me; an 
<A NAME="292"></A>upper servant brought me bread and offered me many things of what there 
<A NAME="293"></A>was in the house, and then Circe bade me eat, but I would not, and sat 
<A NAME="294"></A>without heeding what was before me, still moody and 
<A NAME="295"></A>suspicious.
<A NAME="296"></A><BR><BR>"When Circe saw me sitting there without eating, and in great grief, 
<A NAME="297"></A>she came to me and said, 'Ulysses, why do you sit like that as though you 
<A NAME="298"></A>were dumb, gnawing at your own heart, and refusing both meat and drink? 
<A NAME="299"></A>Is it that you are still suspicious? You ought not to be, for I have already 
<A NAME="300"></A>sworn solemnly that I will not hurt you.'
<A NAME="301"></A><BR><BR>"And I said, 'Circe, no man with any sense of what is right can 
<A NAME="302"></A>think of either eating or drinking in your house until you have set his 
<A NAME="303"></A>friends free and let him see them. If you want me to eat and drink, you 
<A NAME="304"></A>must free my men and bring them to me that I may see them with my own 
<A NAME="305"></A>eyes.'
<A NAME="306"></A><BR><BR>"When I had said this she went straight through the court with 
<A NAME="307"></A>her wand in her hand and opened the pigsty doors. My men came out like 
<A NAME="308"></A>so many prime hogs and stood looking at her, but she went about among them 
<A NAME="309"></A>and anointed each with a second drug, whereon the bristles that the bad 
<A NAME="310"></A>drug had given them fell off, and they became men again, younger than they 
<A NAME="311"></A>were before, and much taller and better looking. They knew me at once, 
<A NAME="312"></A>seized me each of them by the hand, and wept for joy till the whole house 
<A NAME="313"></A>was filled with the sound of their hullabalooing, and Circe herself was 
<A NAME="314"></A>so sorry for them that she came up to me and said, 'Ulysses, noble son 
<A NAME="315"></A>of Laertes, go back at once to the sea where you have left your ship, and 
<A NAME="316"></A>first draw it on to the land. Then, hide all your ship's gear and property 
<A NAME="317"></A>in some cave, and come back here with your men.'
<A NAME="318"></A><BR><BR>"I agreed to this, so I went back to the sea shore, and found the 
<A NAME="319"></A>men at the ship weeping and wailing most piteously. When they saw me the 
<A NAME="320"></A>silly blubbering fellows began frisking round me as calves break out and 
<A NAME="321"></A>gambol round their mothers, when they see them coming home to be milked 
<A NAME="322"></A>after they have been feeding all day, and the homestead resounds with their 
<A NAME="323"></A>lowing. They seemed as glad to see me as though they had got back to their 
<A NAME="324"></A>own rugged Ithaca, where they had been born and bred. 'Sir,' said the affectionate 
<A NAME="325"></A>creatures, 'we are as glad to see you back as though we had got safe home 
<A NAME="326"></A>to Ithaca; but tell us all about the fate of our comrades.'
<A NAME="327"></A><BR><BR>"I spoke comfortingly to them and said, 'We must draw our ship 
<A NAME="328"></A>on to the land, and hide the ship's gear with all our property in some 
<A NAME="329"></A>cave; then come with me all of you as fast as you can to Circe's house, 
<A NAME="330"></A>where you will find your comrades eating and drinking in the midst of great 
<A NAME="331"></A>abundance.'
<A NAME="332"></A><BR><BR>"On this the men would have come with me at once, but Eurylochus 
<A NAME="333"></A>tried to hold them back and said, 'Alas, poor wretches that we are, what 
<A NAME="334"></A>will become of us? Rush not on your ruin by going to the house of Circe, 
<A NAME="335"></A>who will turn us all into pigs or wolves or lions, and we shall have to 
<A NAME="336"></A>keep guard over her house. Remember how the Cyclops treated us when our 
<A NAME="337"></A>comrades went inside his cave, and Ulysses with them. It was all through 
<A NAME="338"></A>his sheer folly that those men lost their lives.'
<A NAME="339"></A><BR><BR>"When I heard him I was in two minds whether or no to draw the 
<A NAME="340"></A>keen blade that hung by my sturdy thigh and cut his head off in spite of 
<A NAME="341"></A>his being a near relation of my own; but the men interceded for him and 
<A NAME="342"></A>said, 'Sir, if it may so be, let this fellow stay here and mind the ship, 
<A NAME="343"></A>but take the rest of us with you to Circe's house.'
<A NAME="344"></A><BR><BR>"On this we all went inland, and Eurylochus was not left behind 
<A NAME="345"></A>after all, but came on too, for he was frightened by the severe reprimand 
<A NAME="346"></A>that I had given him.
<A NAME="347"></A><BR><BR>"Meanwhile Circe had been seeing that the men who had been left 
<A NAME="348"></A>behind were washed and anointed with olive oil; she had also given them 
<A NAME="349"></A>woollen cloaks and shirts, and when we came we found them all comfortably 
<A NAME="350"></A>at dinner in her house. As soon as the men saw each other face to face 
<A NAME="351"></A>and knew one another, they wept for joy and cried aloud till the whole 
<A NAME="352"></A>palace rang again. Thereon Circe came up to me and said, 'Ulysses, noble 
<A NAME="353"></A>son of Laertes, tell your men to leave off crying; I know how much you 
<A NAME="354"></A>have all of you suffered at sea, and how ill you have fared among cruel 
<A NAME="355"></A>savages on the mainland, but that is over now, so stay here, and eat and 
<A NAME="356"></A>drink till you are once more as strong and hearty as you were when you 
<A NAME="357"></A>left Ithaca; for at present you are weakened both in body and mind; you 
<A NAME="358"></A>keep all the time thinking of the hardships- you have suffered during your 
<A NAME="359"></A>travels, so that you have no more cheerfulness left in 
<A NAME="360"></A>you.'
<A NAME="361"></A><BR><BR>"Thus did she speak and we assented. We stayed with Circe for a 
<A NAME="362"></A>whole twelvemonth feasting upon an untold quantity both of meat and wine. 
<A NAME="363"></A>But when the year had passed in the waning of moons and the long days had 
<A NAME="364"></A>come round, my men called me apart and said, 'Sir, it is time you began 
<A NAME="365"></A>to think about going home, if so be you are to be spared to see your house 
<A NAME="366"></A>and native country at all.'
<A NAME="367"></A><BR><BR>"Thus did they speak and I assented. Thereon through the livelong 
<A NAME="368"></A>day to the going down of the sun we feasted our fill on meat and wine, 
<A NAME="369"></A>but when the sun went down and it came on dark the men laid themselves 
<A NAME="370"></A>down to sleep in the covered cloisters. I, however, after I had got into 
<A NAME="371"></A>bed with Circe, besought her by her knees, and the goddess listened to 
<A NAME="372"></A>what I had got to say. 'Circe,' said I, 'please to keep the promise you 
<A NAME="373"></A>made me about furthering me on my homeward voyage. I want to get back and 
<A NAME="374"></A>so do my men, they are always pestering me with their complaints as soon 
<A NAME="375"></A>as ever your back is turned.'
<A NAME="376"></A><BR><BR>"And the goddess answered, 'Ulysses, noble son of Laertes, you 
<A NAME="377"></A>shall none of you stay here any longer if you do not want to, but there 
<A NAME="378"></A>is another journey which you have got to take before you can sail homewards. 
<A NAME="379"></A>You must go to the house of Hades and of dread Proserpine to consult the 
<A NAME="380"></A>ghost of the blind Theban prophet Teiresias whose reason is still unshaken. 
<A NAME="381"></A>To him alone has Proserpine left his understanding even in death, but the 
<A NAME="382"></A>other ghosts flit about aimlessly.'
<A NAME="383"></A><BR><BR>"I was dismayed when I heard this. I sat up in bed and wept, and 
<A NAME="384"></A>would gladly have lived no longer to see the light of the sun, but presently 
<A NAME="385"></A>when I was tired of weeping and tossing myself about, I said, 'And who 
<A NAME="386"></A>shall guide me upon this voyage- for the house of Hades is a port that 
<A NAME="387"></A>no ship can reach.'
<A NAME="388"></A><BR><BR>"'You will want no guide,' she answered; 'raise you mast, set your 
<A NAME="389"></A>white sails, sit quite still, and the North Wind will blow you there of 
<A NAME="390"></A>itself. When your ship has traversed the waters of Oceanus, you will reach 
<A NAME="391"></A>the fertile shore of Proserpine's country with its groves of tall poplars 
<A NAME="392"></A>and willows that shed their fruit untimely; here beach your ship upon the 
<A NAME="393"></A>shore of Oceanus, and go straight on to the dark abode of Hades. You will 
<A NAME="394"></A>find it near the place where the rivers Pyriphlegethon and Cocytus (which 
<A NAME="395"></A>is a branch of the river Styx) flow into Acheron, and you will see a rock 
<A NAME="396"></A>near it, just where the two roaring rivers run into one 
<A NAME="397"></A>another.
<A NAME="398"></A><BR><BR>"'When you have reached this spot, as I now tell you, dig a trench 
<A NAME="399"></A>a cubit or so in length, breadth, and depth, and pour into it as a drink-offering 
<A NAME="400"></A>to all the dead, first, honey mixed with milk, then wine, and in the third 
<A NAME="401"></A>place water-sprinkling white barley meal over the whole. Moreover you must 
<A NAME="402"></A>offer many prayers to the poor feeble ghosts, and promise them that when 
<A NAME="403"></A>you get back to Ithaca you will sacrifice a barren heifer to them, the 
<A NAME="404"></A>best you have, and will load the pyre with good things. More particularly 
<A NAME="405"></A>you must promise that Teiresias shall have a black sheep all to himself, 
<A NAME="406"></A>the finest in all your flocks.
<A NAME="407"></A><BR><BR>"'When you shall have thus besought the ghosts with your prayers, 
<A NAME="408"></A>offer them a ram and a black ewe, bending their heads towards Erebus; but 
<A NAME="409"></A>yourself turn away from them as though you would make towards the river. 
<A NAME="410"></A>On this, many dead men's ghosts will come to you, and you must tell your 
<A NAME="411"></A>men to skin the two sheep that you have just killed, and offer them as 
<A NAME="412"></A>a burnt sacrifice with prayers to Hades and to Proserpine. Then draw your 
<A NAME="413"></A>sword and sit there, so as to prevent any other poor ghost from coming 
<A NAME="414"></A>near the split blood before Teiresias shall have answered your questions. 
<A NAME="415"></A>The seer will presently come to you, and will tell you about your voyage- 
<A NAME="416"></A>what stages you are to make, and how you are to sail the see so as to reach 
<A NAME="417"></A>your home.'
<A NAME="418"></A><BR><BR>"It was day-break by the time she had done speaking, so she dressed 
<A NAME="419"></A>me in my shirt and cloak. As for herself she threw a beautiful light gossamer 
<A NAME="420"></A>fabric over her shoulders, fastening it with a golden girdle round her 
<A NAME="421"></A>waist, and she covered her head with a mantle. Then I went about among 
<A NAME="422"></A>the men everywhere all over the house, and spoke kindly to each of them 
<A NAME="423"></A>man by man: 'You must not lie sleeping here any longer,' said I to them, 
<A NAME="424"></A>'we must be going, for Circe has told me all about it.' And this they did 
<A NAME="425"></A>as I bade them.
<A NAME="426"></A><BR><BR>"Even so, however, I did not get them away without misadventure. 
<A NAME="427"></A>We had with us a certain youth named Elpenor, not very remarkable for sense 
<A NAME="428"></A>or courage, who had got drunk and was lying on the house-top away from 
<A NAME="429"></A>the rest of the men, to sleep off his liquor in the cool. When he heard 
<A NAME="430"></A>the noise of the men bustling about, he jumped up on a sudden and forgot 
<A NAME="431"></A>all about coming down by the main staircase, so he tumbled right off the 
<A NAME="432"></A>roof and broke his neck, and his soul went down to the house of 
<A NAME="433"></A>Hades.
<A NAME="434"></A><BR><BR>"When I had got the men together I said to them, 'You think you 
<A NAME="435"></A>are about to start home again, but Circe has explained to me that instead 
<A NAME="436"></A>of this, we have got to go to the house of Hades and Proserpine to consult 
<A NAME="437"></A>the ghost of the Theban prophet Teiresias.'
<A NAME="438"></A><BR><BR>"The men were broken-hearted as they heard me, and threw themselves 
<A NAME="439"></A>on the ground groaning and tearing their hair, but they did not mend matters 
<A NAME="440"></A>by crying. When we reached the sea shore, weeping and lamenting our fate, 
<A NAME="441"></A>Circe brought the ram and the ewe, and we made them fast hard by the ship. 
<A NAME="442"></A>She passed through the midst of us without our knowing it, for who can 
<A NAME="443"></A>see the comings and goings of a god, if the god does not wish to be 
<A NAME="444"></A>seen?
