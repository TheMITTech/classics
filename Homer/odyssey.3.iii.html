<A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A>But as the sun was rising from the fair sea into the firmament of heaven 
<A NAME="11"></A>to shed light on mortals and immortals, they reached Pylos the city of 
<A NAME="12"></A>Neleus. Now the people of Pylos were gathered on the sea shore to offer 
<A NAME="13"></A>sacrifice of black bulls to Neptune lord of the Earthquake. There were 
<A NAME="14"></A>nine guilds with five hundred men in each, and there were nine bulls to 
<A NAME="15"></A>each guild. As they were eating the inward meats and burning the thigh 
<A NAME="16"></A>bones [on the embers] in the name of Neptune, Telemachus and his crew arrived, 
<A NAME="17"></A>furled their sails, brought their ship to anchor, and went 
<A NAME="18"></A>ashore.
<A NAME="19"></A><BR><BR>Minerva led the way and Telemachus followed her. Presently she 
<A NAME="20"></A>said, "Telemachus, you must not be in the least shy or nervous; you have 
<A NAME="21"></A>taken this voyage to try and find out where your father is buried and how 
<A NAME="22"></A>he came by his end; so go straight up to Nestor that we may see what he 
<A NAME="23"></A>has got to tell us. Beg of him to speak the truth, and he will tell no 
<A NAME="24"></A>lies, for he is an excellent person."
<A NAME="25"></A><BR><BR>"But how, Mentor," replied Telemachus, "dare I go up to Nestor, 
<A NAME="26"></A>and how am I to address him? I have never yet been used to holding long 
<A NAME="27"></A>conversations with people, and am ashamed to begin questioning one who 
<A NAME="28"></A>is so much older than myself."
<A NAME="29"></A><BR><BR>"Some things, Telemachus," answered Minerva, "will be suggested 
<A NAME="30"></A>to you by your own instinct, and heaven will prompt you further; for I 
<A NAME="31"></A>am assured that the gods have been with you from the time of your birth 
<A NAME="32"></A>until now."
<A NAME="33"></A><BR><BR>She then went quickly on, and Telemachus followed in her steps 
<A NAME="34"></A>till they reached the place where the guilds of the Pylian people were 
<A NAME="35"></A>assembled. There they found Nestor sitting with his sons, while his company 
<A NAME="36"></A>round him were busy getting dinner ready, and putting pieces of meat on 
<A NAME="37"></A>to the spits while other pieces were cooking. When they saw the strangers 
<A NAME="38"></A>they crowded round them, took them by the hand and bade them take their 
<A NAME="39"></A>places. Nestor's son Pisistratus at once offered his hand to each of them, 
<A NAME="40"></A>and seated them on some soft sheepskins that were lying on the sands near 
<A NAME="41"></A>his father and his brother Thrasymedes. Then he gave them their portions 
<A NAME="42"></A>of the inward meats and poured wine for them into a golden cup, handing 
<A NAME="43"></A>it to Minerva first, and saluting her at the same time.
<A NAME="44"></A><BR><BR>"Offer a prayer, sir," said he, "to King Neptune, for it is his 
<A NAME="45"></A>feast that you are joining; when you have duly prayed and made your drink-offering, 
<A NAME="46"></A>pass the cup to your friend that he may do so also. I doubt not that he 
<A NAME="47"></A>too lifts his hands in prayer, for man cannot live without God in the world. 
<A NAME="48"></A>Still he is younger than you are, and is much of an age with myself, so 
<A NAME="49"></A>I he handed I will give you the precedence."
<A NAME="50"></A><BR><BR>As he spoke he handed her the cup. Minerva thought it very right 
<A NAME="51"></A>and proper of him to have given it to herself first; she accordingly began 
<A NAME="52"></A>praying heartily to Neptune. "O thou," she cried, "that encirclest the 
<A NAME="53"></A>earth, vouchsafe to grant the prayers of thy servants that call upon thee. 
<A NAME="54"></A>More especially we pray thee send down thy grace on Nestor and on his sons; 
<A NAME="55"></A>thereafter also make the rest of the Pylian people some handsome return 
<A NAME="56"></A>for the goodly hecatomb they are offering you. Lastly, grant Telemachus 
<A NAME="57"></A>and myself a happy issue, in respect of the matter that has brought us 
<A NAME="58"></A>in our to Pylos."
<A NAME="59"></A><BR><BR>When she had thus made an end of praying, she handed the cup to 
<A NAME="60"></A>Telemachus and he prayed likewise. By and by, when the outer meats were 
<A NAME="61"></A>roasted and had been taken off the spits, the carvers gave every man his 
<A NAME="62"></A>portion and they all made an excellent dinner. As soon as they had had 
<A NAME="63"></A>enough to eat and drink, Nestor, knight of Gerene, began to 
<A NAME="64"></A>speak.
<A NAME="65"></A><BR><BR>"Now," said he, "that our guests have done their dinner, it will 
<A NAME="66"></A>be best to ask them who they are. Who, then, sir strangers, are you, and 
<A NAME="67"></A>from what port have you sailed? Are you traders? or do you sail the seas 
<A NAME="68"></A>as rovers with your hand against every man, and every man's hand against 
<A NAME="69"></A>you?"
<A NAME="70"></A><BR><BR>Telemachus answered boldly, for Minerva had given him courage to 
<A NAME="71"></A>ask about his father and get himself a good name.
<A NAME="72"></A><BR><BR>"Nestor," said he, "son of Neleus, honour to the Achaean name, 
<A NAME="73"></A>you ask whence we come, and I will tell you. We come from Ithaca under 
<A NAME="74"></A>Neritum, and the matter about which I would speak is of private not public 
<A NAME="75"></A>import. I seek news of my unhappy father Ulysses, who is said to have sacked 
<A NAME="76"></A>the town of Troy in company with yourself. We know what fate befell each 
<A NAME="77"></A>one of the other heroes who fought at Troy, but as regards Ulysses heaven 
<A NAME="78"></A>has hidden from us the knowledge even that he is dead at all, for no one 
<A NAME="79"></A>can certify us in what place he perished, nor say whether he fell in battle 
<A NAME="80"></A>on the mainland, or was lost at sea amid the waves of Amphitrite. Therefore 
<A NAME="81"></A>I am suppliant at your knees, if haply you may be pleased to tell me of 
<A NAME="82"></A>his melancholy end, whether you saw it with your own eyes, or heard it 
<A NAME="83"></A>from some other traveller, for he was a man born to trouble. Do not soften 
<A NAME="84"></A>things out of any pity for me, but tell me in all plainness exactly what 
<A NAME="85"></A>you saw. If my brave father Ulysses ever did you loyal service, either 
<A NAME="86"></A>by word or deed, when you Achaeans were harassed among the Trojans, bear 
<A NAME="87"></A>it in mind now as in my favour and tell me truly all."
<A NAME="88"></A><BR><BR>"My friend," answered Nestor, "you recall a time of much sorrow 
<A NAME="89"></A>to my mind, for the brave Achaeans suffered much both at sea, while privateering 
<A NAME="90"></A>under Achilles, and when fighting before the great city of king Priam. 
<A NAME="91"></A>Our best men all of them fell there- Ajax, Achilles, Patroclus peer of 
<A NAME="92"></A>gods in counsel, and my own dear son Antilochus, a man singularly fleet 
<A NAME="93"></A>of foot and in fight valiant. But we suffered much more than this; what 
<A NAME="94"></A>mortal tongue indeed could tell the whole story? Though you were to stay 
<A NAME="95"></A>here and question me for five years, or even six, I could not tell you 
<A NAME="96"></A>all that the Achaeans suffered, and you would turn homeward weary of my 
<A NAME="97"></A>tale before it ended. Nine long years did we try every kind of stratagem, 
<A NAME="98"></A>but the hand of heaven was against us; during all this time there was no 
<A NAME="99"></A>one who could compare with your father in subtlety- if indeed you are his 
<A NAME="100"></A>son- I can hardly believe my eyes- and you talk just like him too- no one 
<A NAME="101"></A>would say that people of such different ages could speak so much alike. 
<A NAME="102"></A>He and I never had any kind of difference from first to last neither in 
<A NAME="103"></A>camp nor council, but in singleness of heart and purpose we advised the 
<A NAME="104"></A>Argives how all might be ordered for the best.
<A NAME="105"></A><BR><BR>"When however, we had sacked the city of Priam, and were setting 
<A NAME="106"></A>sail in our ships as heaven had dispersed us, then Jove saw fit to vex 
<A NAME="107"></A>the Argives on their homeward voyage; for they had Not all been either 
<A NAME="108"></A>wise or understanding, and hence many came to a bad end through the displeasure 
<A NAME="109"></A>of Jove's daughter Minerva, who brought about a quarrel between the two 
<A NAME="110"></A>sons of Atreus.
<A NAME="111"></A><BR><BR>"The sons of Atreus called a meeting which was not as it should 
<A NAME="112"></A>be, for it was sunset and the Achaeans were heavy with wine. When they 
<A NAME="113"></A>explained why they had called- the people together, it seemed that Menelaus 
<A NAME="114"></A>was for sailing homeward at once, and this displeased Agamemnon, who thought 
<A NAME="115"></A>that we should wait till we had offered hecatombs to appease the anger 
<A NAME="116"></A>of Minerva. Fool that he was, he might have known that he would not prevail 
<A NAME="117"></A>with her, for when the gods have made up their minds they do not change 
<A NAME="118"></A>them lightly. So the two stood bandying hard words, whereon the Achaeans 
<A NAME="119"></A>sprang to their feet with a cry that rent the air, and were of two minds 
<A NAME="120"></A>as to what they should do.
<A NAME="121"></A><BR><BR>"That night we rested and nursed our anger, for Jove was hatching 
<A NAME="122"></A>mischief against us. But in the morning some of us drew our ships into 
<A NAME="123"></A>the water and put our goods with our women on board, while the rest, about 
<A NAME="124"></A>half in number, stayed behind with Agamemnon. We- the other half- embarked 
<A NAME="125"></A>and sailed; and the ships went well, for heaven had smoothed the sea. When 
<A NAME="126"></A>we reached Tenedos we offered sacrifices to the gods, for we were longing 
<A NAME="127"></A>to get home; cruel Jove, however, did not yet mean that we should do so, 
<A NAME="128"></A>and raised a second quarrel in the course of which some among us turned 
<A NAME="129"></A>their ships back again, and sailed away under Ulysses to make their peace 
<A NAME="130"></A>with Agamemnon; but I, and all the ships that were with me pressed forward, 
<A NAME="131"></A>for I saw that mischief was brewing. The son of Tydeus went on also with 
<A NAME="132"></A>me, and his crews with him. Later on Menelaus joined us at Lesbos, and 
<A NAME="133"></A>found us making up our minds about our course- for we did not know whether 
<A NAME="134"></A>to go outside Chios by the island of Psyra, keeping this to our left, or 
<A NAME="135"></A>inside Chios, over against the stormy headland of Mimas. So we asked heaven 
<A NAME="136"></A>for a sign, and were shown one to the effect that we should be soonest 
<A NAME="137"></A>out of danger if we headed our ships across the open sea to Euboea. This 
<A NAME="138"></A>we therefore did, and a fair wind sprang up which gave us a quick passage 
<A NAME="139"></A>during the night to Geraestus, where we offered many sacrifices to Neptune 
<A NAME="140"></A>for having helped us so far on our way. Four days later Diomed and his 
<A NAME="141"></A>men stationed their ships in Argos, but I held on for Pylos, and the wind 
<A NAME="142"></A>never fell light from the day when heaven first made it fair for 
<A NAME="143"></A>me.
<A NAME="144"></A><BR><BR>"Therefore, my dear young friend, I returned without hearing anything 
<A NAME="145"></A>about the others. I know neither who got home safely nor who were lost 
<A NAME="146"></A>but, as in duty bound, I will give you without reserve the reports that 
<A NAME="147"></A>have reached me since I have been here in my own house. They say the Myrmidons 
<A NAME="148"></A>returned home safely under Achilles' son Neoptolemus; so also did the valiant 
<A NAME="149"></A>son of Poias, Philoctetes. Idomeneus, again, lost no men at sea, and all 
<A NAME="150"></A>his followers who escaped death in the field got safe home with him to 
<A NAME="151"></A>Crete. No matter how far out of the world you live, you will have heard 
<A NAME="152"></A>of Agamemnon and the bad end he came to at the hands of Aegisthus- and 
<A NAME="153"></A>a fearful reckoning did Aegisthus presently pay. See what a good thing 
<A NAME="154"></A>it is for a man to leave a son behind him to do as Orestes did, who killed 
<A NAME="155"></A>false Aegisthus the murderer of his noble father. You too, then- for you 
<A NAME="156"></A>are a tall, smart-looking fellow- show your mettle and make yourself a 
<A NAME="157"></A>name in story."
<A NAME="158"></A><BR><BR>"Nestor son of Neleus," answered Telemachus, "honour to the Achaean 
<A NAME="159"></A>name, the Achaeans applaud Orestes and his name will live through all time 
<A NAME="160"></A>for he has avenged his father nobly. Would that heaven might grant me to 
<A NAME="161"></A>do like vengeance on the insolence of the wicked suitors, who are ill treating 
<A NAME="162"></A>me and plotting my ruin; but the gods have no such happiness in store for 
<A NAME="163"></A>me and for my father, so we must bear it as best we 
<A NAME="164"></A>may."
<A NAME="165"></A><BR><BR>"My friend," said Nestor, "now that you remind me, I remember to 
<A NAME="166"></A>have heard that your mother has many suitors, who are ill disposed towards 
<A NAME="167"></A>you and are making havoc of your estate. Do you submit to this tamely, 
<A NAME="168"></A>or are public feeling and the voice of heaven against you? Who knows but 
<A NAME="169"></A>what Ulysses may come back after all, and pay these scoundrels in full, 
<A NAME="170"></A>either single-handed or with a force of Achaeans behind him? If Minerva 
<A NAME="171"></A>were to take as great a liking to you as she did to Ulysses when we were 
<A NAME="172"></A>fighting before Troy (for I never yet saw the gods so openly fond of any 
<A NAME="173"></A>one as Minerva then was of your father), if she would take as good care 
<A NAME="174"></A>of you as she did of him, these wooers would soon some of them him, forget 
<A NAME="175"></A>their wooing."
<A NAME="176"></A><BR><BR>Telemachus answered, "I can expect nothing of the kind; it would 
<A NAME="177"></A>be far too much to hope for. I dare not let myself think of it. Even though 
<A NAME="178"></A>the gods themselves willed it no such good fortune could befall 
<A NAME="179"></A>me."
<A NAME="180"></A><BR><BR>On this Minerva said, "Telemachus, what are you talking about? 
<A NAME="181"></A>Heaven has a long arm if it is minded to save a man; and if it were me, 
<A NAME="182"></A>I should not care how much I suffered before getting home, provided I could 
<A NAME="183"></A>be safe when I was once there. I would rather this, than get home quickly, 
<A NAME="184"></A>and then be killed in my own house as Agamemnon was by the treachery of 
<A NAME="185"></A>Aegisthus and his wife. Still, death is certain, and when a man's hour 
<A NAME="186"></A>is come, not even the gods can save him, no matter how fond they are of 
<A NAME="187"></A>him."
<A NAME="188"></A><BR><BR>"Mentor," answered Telemachus, "do not let us talk about it any 
<A NAME="189"></A>more. There is no chance of my father's ever coming back; the gods have 
<A NAME="190"></A>long since counselled his destruction. There is something else, however, 
<A NAME="191"></A>about which I should like to ask Nestor, for he knows much more than any 
<A NAME="192"></A>one else does. They say he has reigned for three generations so that it 
<A NAME="193"></A>is like talking to an immortal. Tell me, therefore, Nestor, and tell me 
<A NAME="194"></A>true; how did Agamemnon come to die in that way? What was Menelaus doing? 
<A NAME="195"></A>And how came false Aegisthus to kill so far better a man than himself? 
<A NAME="196"></A>Was Menelaus away from Achaean Argos, voyaging elsewhither among mankind, 
<A NAME="197"></A>that Aegisthus took heart and killed Agamemnon?"
<A NAME="198"></A><BR><BR>"I will tell you truly," answered Nestor, "and indeed you have 
<A NAME="199"></A>yourself divined how it all happened. If Menelaus when he got back from 
<A NAME="200"></A>Troy had found Aegisthus still alive in his house, there would have been 
<A NAME="201"></A>no barrow heaped up for him, not even when he was dead, but he would have 
<A NAME="202"></A>been thrown outside the city to dogs and vultures, and not a woman would 
<A NAME="203"></A>have mourned him, for he had done a deed of great wickedness; but we were 
<A NAME="204"></A>over there, fighting hard at Troy, and Aegisthus who was taking his ease 
<A NAME="205"></A>quietly in the heart of Argos, cajoled Agamemnon's wife Clytemnestra with 
<A NAME="206"></A>incessant flattery.
<A NAME="207"></A><BR><BR>"At first she would have nothing to do with his wicked scheme, 
<A NAME="208"></A>for she was of a good natural disposition; moreover there was a bard with 
<A NAME="209"></A>her, to whom Agamemnon had given strict orders on setting out for Troy, 
<A NAME="210"></A>that he was to keep guard over his wife; but when heaven had counselled 
<A NAME="211"></A>her destruction, Aegisthus thus this bard off to a desert island and left 
<A NAME="212"></A>him there for crows and seagulls to batten upon- after which she went willingly 
<A NAME="213"></A>enough to the house of Aegisthus. Then he offered many burnt sacrifices 
<A NAME="214"></A>to the gods, and decorated many temples with tapestries and gilding, for 
<A NAME="215"></A>he had succeeded far beyond his expectations.
<A NAME="216"></A><BR><BR>"Meanwhile Menelaus and I were on our way home from Troy, on good 
<A NAME="217"></A>terms with one another. When we got to Sunium, which is the point of Athens, 
<A NAME="218"></A>Apollo with his painless shafts killed Phrontis the steersman of Menelaus' 
<A NAME="219"></A>ship (and never man knew better how to handle a vessel in rough weather) 
<A NAME="220"></A>so that he died then and there with the helm in his hand, and Menelaus, 
<A NAME="221"></A>though very anxious to press forward, had to wait in order to bury his 
<A NAME="222"></A>comrade and give him his due funeral rites. Presently, when he too could 
<A NAME="223"></A>put to sea again, and had sailed on as far as the Malean heads, Jove counselled 
<A NAME="224"></A>evil against him and made it it blow hard till the waves ran mountains 
<A NAME="225"></A>high. Here he divided his fleet and took the one half towards Crete where 
<A NAME="226"></A>the Cydonians dwell round about the waters of the river Iardanus. There 
<A NAME="227"></A>is a high headland hereabouts stretching out into the sea from a place 
<A NAME="228"></A>called Gortyn, and all along this part of the coast as far as Phaestus 
<A NAME="229"></A>the sea runs high when there is a south wind blowing, but arter Phaestus 
<A NAME="230"></A>the coast is more protected, for a small headland can make a great shelter. 
<A NAME="231"></A>Here this part of the fleet was driven on to the rocks and wrecked; but 
<A NAME="232"></A>the crews just managed to save themselves. As for the other five ships, 
<A NAME="233"></A>they were taken by winds and seas to Egypt, where Menelaus gathered much 
<A NAME="234"></A>gold and substance among people of an alien speech. Meanwhile Aegisthus 
<A NAME="235"></A>here at home plotted his evil deed. For seven years after he had killed 
<A NAME="236"></A>Agamemnon he ruled in Mycene, and the people were obedient under him, but 
<A NAME="237"></A>in the eighth year Orestes came back from Athens to be his bane, and killed 
<A NAME="238"></A>the murderer of his father. Then he celebrated the funeral rites of his 
<A NAME="239"></A>mother and of false Aegisthus by a banquet to the people of Argos, and 
<A NAME="240"></A>on that very day Menelaus came home, with as much treasure as his ships 
<A NAME="241"></A>could carry.
<A NAME="242"></A><BR><BR>"Take my advice then, and do not go travelling about for long so 
<A NAME="243"></A>far from home, nor leave your property with such dangerous people in your 
<A NAME="244"></A>house; they will eat up everything you have among them, and you will have 
<A NAME="245"></A>been on a fool's errand. Still, I should advise you by all means to go 
<A NAME="246"></A>and visit Menelaus, who has lately come off a voyage among such distant 
<A NAME="247"></A>peoples as no man could ever hope to get back from, when the winds had 
<A NAME="248"></A>once carried him so far out of his reckoning; even birds cannot fly the 
<A NAME="249"></A>distance in a twelvemonth, so vast and terrible are the seas that they 
<A NAME="250"></A>must cross. Go to him, therefore, by sea, and take your own men with you; 
<A NAME="251"></A>or if you would rather travel by land you can have a chariot, you can have 
<A NAME="252"></A>horses, and here are my sons who can escort you to Lacedaemon where Menelaus 
<A NAME="253"></A>lives. Beg of him to speak the truth, and he will tell you no lies, for 
<A NAME="254"></A>he is an excellent person."
<A NAME="255"></A><BR><BR>As he spoke the sun set and it came on dark, whereon Minerva said, 
<A NAME="256"></A>"Sir, all that you have said is well; now, however, order the tongues of 
<A NAME="257"></A>the victims to be cut, and mix wine that we may make drink-offerings to 
<A NAME="258"></A>Neptune, and the other immortals, and then go to bed, for it is bed time. 
<A NAME="259"></A>People should go away early and not keep late hours at a religious 
<A NAME="260"></A>festival."
<A NAME="261"></A><BR><BR>Thus spoke the daughter of Jove, and they obeyed her saying. Men 
<A NAME="262"></A>servants poured water over the hands of the guests, while pages filled 
<A NAME="263"></A>the mixing-bowls with wine and water, and handed it round after giving 
<A NAME="264"></A>every man his drink-offering; then they threw the tongues of the victims 
<A NAME="265"></A>into the fire, and stood up to make their drink-offerings. When they had 
<A NAME="266"></A>made their offerings and had drunk each as much as he was minded, Minerva 
<A NAME="267"></A>and Telemachus were forgoing on board their ship, but Nestor caught them 
<A NAME="268"></A>up at once and stayed them.
<A NAME="269"></A><BR><BR>"Heaven and the immortal gods," he exclaimed, "forbid that you 
<A NAME="270"></A>should leave my house to go on board of a ship. Do you think I am so poor 
<A NAME="271"></A>and short of clothes, or that I have so few cloaks and as to be unable 
<A NAME="272"></A>to find comfortable beds both for myself and for my guests? Let me tell 
<A NAME="273"></A>you I have store both of rugs and cloaks, and shall not permit the son 
<A NAME="274"></A>of my old friend Ulysses to camp down on the deck of a ship- not while 
<A NAME="275"></A>I live- nor yet will my sons after me, but they will keep open house as 
<A NAME="276"></A>have done."
<A NAME="277"></A><BR><BR>Then Minerva answered, "Sir, you have spoken well, and it will 
<A NAME="278"></A>be much better that Telemachus should do as you have said; he, therefore, 
<A NAME="279"></A>shall return with you and sleep at your house, but I must go back to give 
<A NAME="280"></A>orders to my crew, and keep them in good heart. I am the only older person 
<A NAME="281"></A>among them; the rest are all young men of Telemachus' own age, who have 
<A NAME="282"></A>taken this voyage out of friendship; so I must return to the ship and sleep 
<A NAME="283"></A>there. Moreover to-morrow I must go to the Cauconians where I have a large 
<A NAME="284"></A>sum of money long owing to me. As for Telemachus, now that he is your guest, 
<A NAME="285"></A>send him to Lacedaemon in a chariot, and let one of your sons go with him. 
<A NAME="286"></A>Be pleased also to provide him with your best and fleetest 
<A NAME="287"></A>horses."
<A NAME="288"></A><BR><BR>When she had thus spoken, she flew away in the form of an eagle, 
<A NAME="289"></A>and all marvelled as they beheld it. Nestor was astonished, and took Telemachus 
<A NAME="290"></A>by the hand. "My friend," said he, "I see that you are going to be a great 
<A NAME="291"></A>hero some day, since the gods wait upon you thus while you are still so 
<A NAME="292"></A>young. This can have been none other of those who dwell in heaven than 
<A NAME="293"></A>Jove's redoubtable daughter, the Trito-born, who showed such favour towards 
<A NAME="294"></A>your brave father among the Argives." "Holy queen," he continued, "vouchsafe 
<A NAME="295"></A>to send down thy grace upon myself, my good wife, and my children. In return, 
<A NAME="296"></A>I will offer you in sacrifice a broad-browed heifer of a year old, unbroken, 
<A NAME="297"></A>and never yet brought by man under the yoke. I will gild her horns, and 
<A NAME="298"></A>will offer her up to you in sacrifice."
<A NAME="299"></A><BR><BR>Thus did he pray, and Minerva heard his prayer. He then led the 
<A NAME="300"></A>way to his own house, followed by his sons and sons-in-law. When they had 
<A NAME="301"></A>got there and had taken their places on the benches and seats, he mixed 
<A NAME="302"></A>them a bowl of sweet wine that was eleven years old when the housekeeper 
<A NAME="303"></A>took the lid off the jar that held it. As he mixed the wine, he prayed 
<A NAME="304"></A>much and made drink-offerings to Minerva, daughter of Aegis-bearing Jove. 
<A NAME="305"></A>Then, when they had made their drink-offerings and had drunk each as much 
<A NAME="306"></A>as he was minded, the others went home to bed each in his own abode; but 
<A NAME="307"></A>Nestor put Telemachus to sleep in the room that was over the gateway along 
<A NAME="308"></A>with Pisistratus, who was the only unmarried son now left him. As for himself, 
<A NAME="309"></A>he slept in an inner room of the house, with the queen his wife by his 
<A NAME="310"></A>side.
<A NAME="311"></A><BR><BR>Now when the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, Nestor 
<A NAME="312"></A>left his couch and took his seat on the benches of white and polished marble 
<A NAME="313"></A>that stood in front of his house. Here aforetime sat Neleus, peer of gods 
<A NAME="314"></A>in counsel, but he was now dead, and had gone to the house of Hades; so 
<A NAME="315"></A>Nestor sat in his seat, sceptre in hand, as guardian of the public weal. 
<A NAME="316"></A>His sons as they left their rooms gathered round him, Echephron, Stratius, 
<A NAME="317"></A>Perseus, Aretus, and Thrasymedes; the sixth son was Pisistratus, and when 
<A NAME="318"></A>Telemachus joined them they made him sit with them. Nestor then addressed 
<A NAME="319"></A>them.
<A NAME="320"></A><BR><BR>"My sons," said he, "make haste to do as I shall bid you. I wish 
<A NAME="321"></A>first and foremost to propitiate the great goddess Minerva, who manifested 
<A NAME="322"></A>herself visibly to me during yesterday's festivities. Go, then, one or 
<A NAME="323"></A>other of you to the plain, tell the stockman to look me out a heifer, and 
<A NAME="324"></A>come on here with it at once. Another must go to Telemachus's ship, and 
<A NAME="325"></A>invite all the crew, leaving two men only in charge of the vessel. Some 
<A NAME="326"></A>one else will run and fetch Laerceus the goldsmith to gild the horns of 
<A NAME="327"></A>the heifer. The rest, stay all of you where you are; tell the maids in 
<A NAME="328"></A>the house to prepare an excellent dinner, and to fetch seats, and logs 
<A NAME="329"></A>of wood for a burnt offering. Tell them also- to bring me some clear spring 
<A NAME="330"></A>water."
<A NAME="331"></A><BR><BR>On this they hurried off on their several errands. The heifer was 
<A NAME="332"></A>brought in from the plain, and Telemachus's crew came from the ship; the 
<A NAME="333"></A>goldsmith brought the anvil, hammer, and tongs, with which he worked his 
<A NAME="334"></A>gold, and Minerva herself came to the sacrifice. Nestor gave out the gold, 
<A NAME="335"></A>and the smith gilded the horns of the heifer that the goddess might have 
<A NAME="336"></A>pleasure in their beauty. Then Stratius and Echephron brought her in by 
<A NAME="337"></A>the horns; Aretus fetched water from the house in a ewer that had a flower 
<A NAME="338"></A>pattern on it, and in his other hand he held a basket of barley meal; sturdy 
<A NAME="339"></A>Thrasymedes stood by with a sharp axe, ready to strike the heifer, while 
<A NAME="340"></A>Perseus held a bucket. Then Nestor began with washing his hands and sprinkling 
<A NAME="341"></A>the barley meal, and he offered many a prayer to Minerva as he threw a 
<A NAME="342"></A>lock from the heifer's head upon the fire.
<A NAME="343"></A><BR><BR>When they had done praying and sprinkling the barley meal Thrasymedes 
<A NAME="344"></A>dealt his blow, and brought the heifer down with a stroke that cut through 
<A NAME="345"></A>the tendons at the base of her neck, whereon the daughters and daughters-in-law 
<A NAME="346"></A>of Nestor, and his venerable wife Eurydice (she was eldest daughter to 
<A NAME="347"></A>Clymenus) screamed with delight. Then they lifted the heifer's head from 
<A NAME="348"></A>off the ground, and Pisistratus cut her throat. When she had done bleeding 
<A NAME="349"></A>and was quite dead, they cut her up. They cut out the thigh bones all in 
<A NAME="350"></A>due course, wrapped them round in two layers of fat, and set some pieces 
<A NAME="351"></A>of raw meat on the top of them; then Nestor laid them upon the wood fire 
<A NAME="352"></A>and poured wine over them, while the young men stood near him with five-pronged 
<A NAME="353"></A>spits in their hands. When the thighs were burned and they had tasted the 
<A NAME="354"></A>inward meats, they cut the rest of the meat up small, put the pieces on 
<A NAME="355"></A>the spits and toasted them over the fire.
<A NAME="356"></A><BR><BR>Meanwhile lovely Polycaste, Nestor's youngest daughter, washed 
<A NAME="357"></A>Telemachus. When she had washed him and anointed him with oil, she brought 
<A NAME="358"></A>him a fair mantle and shirt, and he looked like a god as he came from the 
<A NAME="359"></A>bath and took his seat by the side of Nestor. When the outer meats were 
<A NAME="360"></A>done they drew them off the spits and sat down to dinner where they were 
<A NAME="361"></A>waited upon by some worthy henchmen, who kept pouring them out their wine 
<A NAME="362"></A>in cups of gold. As soon as they had had had enough to eat and drink Nestor 
<A NAME="363"></A>said, "Sons, put Telemachus's horses to the chariot that he may start at 
<A NAME="364"></A>once."
<A NAME="365"></A><BR><BR>Thus did he speak, and they did even as he had said, and yoked 
<A NAME="366"></A>the fleet horses to the chariot. The housekeeper packed them up a provision 
<A NAME="367"></A>of bread, wine, and sweetmeats fit for the sons of princes. Then Telemachus 
<A NAME="368"></A>got into the chariot, while Pisistratus gathered up the reins and took 
<A NAME="369"></A>his seat beside him. He lashed the horses on and they flew forward nothing 
<A NAME="370"></A>loth into the open country, leaving the high citadel of Pylos behind them. 
<A NAME="371"></A>All that day did they travel, swaying the yoke upon their necks till the 
<A NAME="372"></A>sun went down and darkness was over all the land. Then they reached Pherae 
<A NAME="373"></A>where Diocles lived, who was son to Ortilochus and grandson to Alpheus. 
<A NAME="374"></A>Here they passed the night and Diocles entertained them hospitably. When 
<A NAME="375"></A>the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn; appeared, they again yoked their 
<A NAME="376"></A>horses and drove out through the gateway under the echoing gatehouse. Pisistratus 
<A NAME="377"></A>lashed the horses on and they flew forward nothing loth; presently they 
<A NAME="378"></A>came to the corn lands Of the open country, and in the course of time completed 
<A NAME="379"></A>their journey, so well did their steeds take them.
<A NAME="380"></A><BR><BR>Now when the sun had set and darkness was over the 
<A NAME="381"></A>land,
