<A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A>Ulysses now left the haven, and took the rough track up through the wooded 
<A NAME="11"></A>country and over the crest of the mountain till he reached the place where 
<A NAME="12"></A>Minerva had said that he would find the swineherd, who was the most thrifty 
<A NAME="13"></A>servant he had. He found him sitting in front of his hut, which was by 
<A NAME="14"></A>the yards that he had built on a site which could be seen from far. He 
<A NAME="15"></A>had made them spacious and fair to see, with a free ran for the pigs all 
<A NAME="16"></A>round them; he had built them during his master's absence, of stones which 
<A NAME="17"></A>he had gathered out of the ground, without saying anything to Penelope 
<A NAME="18"></A>or Laertes, and he had fenced them on top with thorn bushes. Outside the 
<A NAME="19"></A>yard he had run a strong fence of oaken posts, split, and set pretty close 
<A NAME="20"></A>together, while inside lie had built twelve sties near one another for 
<A NAME="21"></A>the sows to lie in. There were fifty pigs wallowing in each sty, all of 
<A NAME="22"></A>them breeding sows; but the boars slept outside and were much fewer in 
<A NAME="23"></A>number, for the suitors kept on eating them, and die swineherd had to send 
<A NAME="24"></A>them the best he had continually. There were three hundred and sixty boar 
<A NAME="25"></A>pigs, and the herdsman's four hounds, which were as fierce as wolves, slept 
<A NAME="26"></A>always with them. The swineherd was at that moment cutting out a pair of 
<A NAME="27"></A>sandals from a good stout ox hide. Three of his men were out herding the 
<A NAME="28"></A>pigs in one place or another, and he had sent the fourth to town with a 
<A NAME="29"></A>boar that he had been forced to send the suitors that they might sacrifice 
<A NAME="30"></A>it and have their fill of meat.
<A NAME="31"></A><BR><BR>When the hounds saw Ulysses they set up a furious barking and flew 
<A NAME="32"></A>at him, but Ulysses was cunning enough to sit down and loose his hold of 
<A NAME="33"></A>the stick that he had in his hand: still, he would have been torn by them 
<A NAME="34"></A>in his own homestead had not the swineherd dropped his ox hide, rushed 
<A NAME="35"></A>full speed through the gate of the yard and driven the dogs off by shouting 
<A NAME="36"></A>and throwing stones at them. Then he said to Ulysses, "Old man, the dogs 
<A NAME="37"></A>were likely to have made short work of you, and then you would have got 
<A NAME="38"></A>me into trouble. The gods have given me quite enough worries without that, 
<A NAME="39"></A>for I have lost the best of masters, and am in continual grief on his account. 
<A NAME="40"></A>I have to attend swine for other people to eat, while he, if he yet lives 
<A NAME="41"></A>to see the light of day, is starving in some distant land. But come inside, 
<A NAME="42"></A>and when you have had your fill of bread and wine, tell me where you come 
<A NAME="43"></A>from, and all about your misfortunes."
<A NAME="44"></A><BR><BR>On this the swineherd led the way into the hut and bade him sit 
<A NAME="45"></A>down. He strewed a good thick bed of rushes upon the floor, and on the 
<A NAME="46"></A>top of this he threw the shaggy chamois skin- a great thick one- on which 
<A NAME="47"></A>he used to sleep by night. Ulysses was pleased at being made thus welcome, 
<A NAME="48"></A>and said "May Jove, sir, and the rest of the gods grant you your heart's 
<A NAME="49"></A>desire in return for the kind way in which you have received 
<A NAME="50"></A>me."
<A NAME="51"></A><BR><BR>To this you answered, O swineherd Eumaeus, "Stranger, though a 
<A NAME="52"></A>still poorer man should come here, it would not be right for me to insult 
<A NAME="53"></A>him, for all strangers and beggars are from Jove. You must take what you 
<A NAME="54"></A>can get and be thankful, for servants live in fear when they have young 
<A NAME="55"></A>lords for their masters; and this is my misfortune now, for heaven has 
<A NAME="56"></A>hindered the return of him who would have been always good to me and given 
<A NAME="57"></A>me something of my own- a house, a piece of land, a good looking wife, 
<A NAME="58"></A>and all else that a liberal master allows a servant who has worked hard 
<A NAME="59"></A>for him, and whose labour the gods have prospered as they have mine in 
<A NAME="60"></A>the situation which I hold. If my master had grown old here he would have 
<A NAME="61"></A>done great things by me, but he is gone, and I wish that Helen's whole 
<A NAME="62"></A>race were utterly destroyed, for she has been the death of many a good 
<A NAME="63"></A>man. It was this matter that took my master to Ilius, the land of noble 
<A NAME="64"></A>steeds, to fight the Trojans in the cause of kin Agamemnon."
<A NAME="65"></A><BR><BR>As he spoke he bound his girdle round him and went to the sties 
<A NAME="66"></A>where the young sucking pigs were penned. He picked out two which he brought 
<A NAME="67"></A>back with him and sacrificed. He singed them, cut them up, and spitted 
<A NAME="68"></A>on them; when the meat was cooked he brought it all in and set it before 
<A NAME="69"></A>Ulysses, hot and still on the spit, whereon Ulysses sprinkled it over with 
<A NAME="70"></A>white barley meal. The swineherd then mixed wine in a bowl of ivy-wood, 
<A NAME="71"></A>and taking a seat opposite Ulysses told him to begin.
<A NAME="72"></A><BR><BR>"Fall to, stranger," said he, "on a dish of servant's pork. The 
<A NAME="73"></A>fat pigs have to go to the suitors, who eat them up without shame or scruple; 
<A NAME="74"></A>but the blessed gods love not such shameful doings, and respect those who 
<A NAME="75"></A>do what is lawful and right. Even the fierce free-booters who go raiding 
<A NAME="76"></A>on other people's land, and Jove gives them their spoil- even they, when 
<A NAME="77"></A>they have filled their ships and got home again live conscience-stricken, 
<A NAME="78"></A>and look fearfully for judgement; but some god seems to have told these 
<A NAME="79"></A>people that Ulysses is dead and gone; they will not, therefore, go back 
<A NAME="80"></A>to their own homes and make their offers of marriage in the usual way, 
<A NAME="81"></A>but waste his estate by force, without fear or stint. Not a day or night 
<A NAME="82"></A>comes out of heaven, but they sacrifice not one victim nor two only, and 
<A NAME="83"></A>they take the run of his wine, for he was exceedingly rich. No other great 
<A NAME="84"></A>man either in Ithaca or on the mainland is as rich as he was; he had as 
<A NAME="85"></A>much as twenty men put together. I will tell you what he had. There are 
<A NAME="86"></A>twelve herds of cattle upon the mainland, and as many flocks of sheep, 
<A NAME="87"></A>there are also twelve droves of pigs, while his own men and hired strangers 
<A NAME="88"></A>feed him twelve widely spreading herds of goats. Here in Ithaca he runs 
<A NAME="89"></A>even large flocks of goats on the far end of the island, and they are in 
<A NAME="90"></A>the charge of excellent goatherds. Each one of these sends the suitors 
<A NAME="91"></A>the best goat in the flock every day. As for myself, I am in charge of 
<A NAME="92"></A>the pigs that you see here, and I have to keep picking out the best I have 
<A NAME="93"></A>and sending it to them."
<A NAME="94"></A><BR><BR>This was his story, but Ulysses went on eating and drinking ravenously 
<A NAME="95"></A>without a word, brooding his revenge. When he had eaten enough and was 
<A NAME="96"></A>satisfied, the swineherd took the bowl from which he usually drank, filled 
<A NAME="97"></A>it with wine, and gave it to Ulysses, who was pleased, and said as he took 
<A NAME="98"></A>it in his hands, "My friend, who was this master of yours that bought you 
<A NAME="99"></A>and paid for you, so rich and so powerful as you tell me? You say he perished 
<A NAME="100"></A>in the cause of King Agamemnon; tell me who he was, in case I may have 
<A NAME="101"></A>met with such a person. Jove and the other gods know, but I may be able 
<A NAME="102"></A>to give you news of him, for I have travelled much."
<A NAME="103"></A><BR><BR>Eumaeus answered, "Old man, no traveller who comes here with news 
<A NAME="104"></A>will get Ulysses' wife and son to believe his story. Nevertheless, tramps 
<A NAME="105"></A>in want of a lodging keep coming with their mouths full of lies, and not 
<A NAME="106"></A>a word of truth; every one who finds his way to Ithaca goes to my mistress 
<A NAME="107"></A>and tells her falsehoods, whereon she takes them in, makes much of them, 
<A NAME="108"></A>and asks them all manner of questions, crying all the time as women will 
<A NAME="109"></A>when they have lost their husbands. And you too, old man, for a shirt and 
<A NAME="110"></A>a cloak would doubtless make up a very pretty story. But the wolves and 
<A NAME="111"></A>birds of prey have long since torn Ulysses to pieces, or the fishes of 
<A NAME="112"></A>the sea have eaten him, and his bones are lying buried deep in sand upon 
<A NAME="113"></A>some foreign shore; he is dead and gone, and a bad business it is for all 
<A NAME="114"></A>his friends- for me especially; go where I may I shall never find so good 
<A NAME="115"></A>a master, not even if I were to go home to my mother and father where I 
<A NAME="116"></A>was bred and born. I do not so much care, however, about my parents now, 
<A NAME="117"></A>though I should dearly like to see them again in my own country; it is 
<A NAME="118"></A>the loss of Ulysses that grieves me most; I cannot speak of him without 
<A NAME="119"></A>reverence though he is here no longer, for he was very fond of me, and 
<A NAME="120"></A>took such care of me that whereever he may be I shall always honour his 
<A NAME="121"></A>memory."
<A NAME="122"></A><BR><BR>"My friend," replied Ulysses, "you are very positive, and very 
<A NAME="123"></A>hard of belief about your master's coming home again, nevertheless I will 
<A NAME="124"></A>not merely say, but will swear, that he is coming. Do not give me anything 
<A NAME="125"></A>for my news till he has actually come, you may then give me a shirt and 
<A NAME="126"></A>cloak of good wear if you will. I am in great want, but I will not take 
<A NAME="127"></A>anything at all till then, for I hate a man, even as I hate hell fire, 
<A NAME="128"></A>who lets his poverty tempt him into lying. I swear by king Jove, by the 
<A NAME="129"></A>rites of hospitality, and by that hearth of Ulysses to which I have now 
<A NAME="130"></A>come, that all will surely happen as I have said it will. Ulysses will 
<A NAME="131"></A>return in this self same year; with the end of this moon and the beginning 
<A NAME="132"></A>of the next he will be here to do vengeance on all those who are ill treating 
<A NAME="133"></A>his wife and son."
<A NAME="134"></A><BR><BR>To this you answered, O swineherd Eumaeus, "Old man, you will neither 
<A NAME="135"></A>get paid for bringing good news, nor will Ulysses ever come home; drink 
<A NAME="136"></A>you wine in peace, and let us talk about something else. Do not keep on 
<A NAME="137"></A>reminding me of all this; it always pains me when any one speaks about 
<A NAME="138"></A>my honoured master. As for your oath we will let it alone, but I only wish 
<A NAME="139"></A>he may come, as do Penelope, his old father Laertes, and his son Telemachus. 
<A NAME="140"></A>I am terribly unhappy too about this same boy of his; he was running up 
<A NAME="141"></A>fast into manhood, and bade fare to be no worse man, face and figure, than 
<A NAME="142"></A>his father, but some one, either god or man, has been unsettling his mind, 
<A NAME="143"></A>so he has gone off to Pylos to try and get news of his father, and the 
<A NAME="144"></A>suitors are lying in wait for him as he is coming home, in the hope of 
<A NAME="145"></A>leaving the house of Arceisius without a name in Ithaca. But let us say 
<A NAME="146"></A>no more about him, and leave him to be taken, or else to escape if the 
<A NAME="147"></A>son of Saturn holds his hand over him to protect him. And now, old man, 
<A NAME="148"></A>tell me your own story; tell me also, for I want to know, who you are and 
<A NAME="149"></A>where you come from. Tell me of your town and parents, what manner of ship 
<A NAME="150"></A>you came in, how crew brought you to Ithaca, and from what country they 
<A NAME="151"></A>professed to come- for you cannot have come by land."
<A NAME="152"></A><BR><BR>And Ulysses answered, "I will tell you all about it. If there were 
<A NAME="153"></A>meat and wine enough, and we could stay here in the hut with nothing to 
<A NAME="154"></A>do but to eat and drink while the others go to their work, I could easily 
<A NAME="155"></A>talk on for a whole twelve months without ever finishing the story of the 
<A NAME="156"></A>sorrows with which it has pleased heaven to visit me.
<A NAME="157"></A><BR><BR>"I am by birth a Cretan; my father was a well-to-do man, who had 
<A NAME="158"></A>many sons born in marriage, whereas I was the son of a slave whom he had 
<A NAME="159"></A>purchased for a concubine; nevertheless, my father Castor son of Hylax 
<A NAME="160"></A>(whose lineage I claim, and who was held in the highest honour among the 
<A NAME="161"></A>Cretans for his wealth, prosperity, and the valour of his sons) put me 
<A NAME="162"></A>on the same level with my brothers who had been born in wedlock. When, 
<A NAME="163"></A>however, death took him to the house of Hades, his sons divided his estate 
<A NAME="164"></A>and cast lots for their shares, but to me they gave a holding and little 
<A NAME="165"></A>else; nevertheless, my valour enabled me to marry into a rich family, for 
<A NAME="166"></A>I was not given to bragging, or shirking on the field of battle. It is 
<A NAME="167"></A>all over now; still, if you look at the straw you can see what the ear 
<A NAME="168"></A>was, for I have had trouble enough and to spare. Mars and Minerva made 
<A NAME="169"></A>me doughty in war; when I had picked my men to surprise the enemy with 
<A NAME="170"></A>an ambuscade I never gave death so much as a thought, but was the first 
<A NAME="171"></A>to leap forward and spear all whom I could overtake. Such was I in battle, 
<A NAME="172"></A>but I did not care about farm work, nor the frugal home life of those who 
<A NAME="173"></A>would bring up children. My delight was in ships, fighting, javelins, and 
<A NAME="174"></A>arrows- things that most men shudder to think of; but one man likes one 
<A NAME="175"></A>thing and another another, and this was what I was most naturally inclined 
<A NAME="176"></A>to. Before the Achaeans went to Troy, nine times was I in command of men 
<A NAME="177"></A>and ships on foreign service, and I amassed much wealth. I had my pick 
<A NAME="178"></A>of the spoil in the first instance, and much more was allotted to me later 
<A NAME="179"></A>on.
<A NAME="180"></A><BR><BR>"My house grew apace and I became a great man among the Cretans, 
<A NAME="181"></A>but when Jove counselled that terrible expedition, in which so many perished, 
<A NAME="182"></A>the people required me and Idomeneus to lead their ships to Troy, and there 
<A NAME="183"></A>was no way out of it, for they insisted on our doing so. There we fought 
<A NAME="184"></A>for nine whole years, but in the tenth we sacked the city of Priam and 
<A NAME="185"></A>sailed home again as heaven dispersed us. Then it was that Jove devised 
<A NAME="186"></A>evil against me. I spent but one month happily with my children, wife, 
<A NAME="187"></A>and property, and then I conceived the idea of making a descent on Egypt, 
<A NAME="188"></A>so I fitted out a fine fleet and manned it. I had nine ships, and the people 
<A NAME="189"></A>flocked to fill them. For six days I and my men made feast, and I found 
<A NAME="190"></A>them many victims both for sacrifice to the gods and for themselves, but 
<A NAME="191"></A>on the seventh day we went on board and set sail from Crete with a fair 
<A NAME="192"></A>North wind behind us though we were going down a river. Nothing went ill 
<A NAME="193"></A>with any of our ships, and we had no sickness on board, but sat where we 
<A NAME="194"></A>were and let the ships go as the wind and steersmen took them. On the fifth 
<A NAME="195"></A>day we reached the river Aegyptus; there I stationed my ships in the river, 
<A NAME="196"></A>bidding my men stay by them and keep guard over them while I sent out scouts 
<A NAME="197"></A>to reconnoitre from every point of vantage.
<A NAME="198"></A><BR><BR>"But the men disobeyed my orders, took to their own devices, and 
<A NAME="199"></A>ravaged the land of the Egyptians, killing the men, and taking their wives 
<A NAME="200"></A>and children captive. The alarm was soon carried to the city, and when 
<A NAME="201"></A>they heard the war cry, the people came out at daybreak till the plain 
<A NAME="202"></A>was filled with horsemen and foot soldiers and with the gleam of armour. 
<A NAME="203"></A>Then Jove spread panic among my men, and they would no longer face the 
<A NAME="204"></A>enemy, for they found themselves surrounded. The Egyptians killed many 
<A NAME="205"></A>of us, and took the rest alive to do forced labour for them. Jove, however, 
<A NAME="206"></A>put it in my mind to do thus- and I wish I had died then and there in Egypt 
<A NAME="207"></A>instead, for there was much sorrow in store for me- I took off my helmet 
<A NAME="208"></A>and shield and dropped my spear from my hand; then I went straight up to 
<A NAME="209"></A>the king's chariot, clasped his knees and kissed them, whereon he spared 
<A NAME="210"></A>my life, bade me get into his chariot, and took me weeping to his own home. 
<A NAME="211"></A>Many made at me with their ashen spears and tried to kil me in their fury, 
<A NAME="212"></A>but the king protected me, for he feared the wrath of Jove the protector 
<A NAME="213"></A>of strangers, who punishes those who do evil.
<A NAME="214"></A><BR><BR>"I stayed there for seven years and got together much money among 
<A NAME="215"></A>the Egyptians, for they all gave me something; but when it was now going 
<A NAME="216"></A>on for eight years there came a certain Phoenician, a cunning rascal, who 
<A NAME="217"></A>had already committed all sorts of villainy, and this man talked me over 
<A NAME="218"></A>into going with him to Phoenicia, where his house and his possessions lay. 
<A NAME="219"></A>I stayed there for a whole twelve months, but at the end of that time when 
<A NAME="220"></A>months and days had gone by till the same season had come round again, 
<A NAME="221"></A>he set me on board a ship bound for Libya, on a pretence that I was to 
<A NAME="222"></A>take a cargo along with him to that place, but really that he might sell 
<A NAME="223"></A>me as a slave and take the money I fetched. I suspected his intention, 
<A NAME="224"></A>but went on board with him, for I could not help it.
<A NAME="225"></A><BR><BR>"The ship ran before a fresh North wind till we had reached the 
<A NAME="226"></A>sea that lies between Crete and Libya; there, however, Jove counselled 
<A NAME="227"></A>their destruction, for as soon as we were well out from Crete and could 
<A NAME="228"></A>see nothing but sea and sky, he raised a black cloud over our ship and 
<A NAME="229"></A>the sea grew dark beneath it. Then Jove let fly with his thunderbolts and 
<A NAME="230"></A>the ship went round and round and was filled with fire and brimstone as 
<A NAME="231"></A>the lightning struck it. The men fell all into the sea; they were carried 
<A NAME="232"></A>about in the water round the ship looking like so many sea-gulls, but the 
<A NAME="233"></A>god presently deprived them of all chance of getting home again. I was 
<A NAME="234"></A>all dismayed; Jove, however, sent the ship's mast within my reach, which 
<A NAME="235"></A>saved my life, for I clung to it, and drifted before the fury of the gale. 
<A NAME="236"></A>Nine days did I drift but in the darkness of the tenth night a great wave 
<A NAME="237"></A>bore me on to the Thesprotian coast. There Pheidon king of the Thesprotians 
<A NAME="238"></A>entertained me hospitably without charging me anything at all for his son 
<A NAME="239"></A>found me when I was nearly dead with cold and fatigue, whereon he raised 
<A NAME="240"></A>me by the hand, took me to his father's house and gave me clothes to 
<A NAME="241"></A>wear.
<A NAME="242"></A><BR><BR>"There it was that I heard news of Ulysses, for the king told me 
<A NAME="243"></A>he had entertained him, and shown him much hospitality while he was on 
<A NAME="244"></A>his homeward journey. He showed me also the treasure of gold, and wrought 
<A NAME="245"></A>iron that Ulysses had got together. There was enough to keep his family 
<A NAME="246"></A>for ten generations, so much had he left in the house of king Pheidon. 
<A NAME="247"></A>But the king said Ulysses had gone to Dodona that he might learn Jove's 
<A NAME="248"></A>mind from the god's high oak tree, and know whether after so long an absence 
<A NAME="249"></A>he should return to Ithaca openly, or in secret. Moreover the king swore 
<A NAME="250"></A>in my presence, making drink-offerings in his own house as he did so, that 
<A NAME="251"></A>the ship was by the water side, and the crew found, that should take him 
<A NAME="252"></A>to his own country. He sent me off however before Ulysses returned, for 
<A NAME="253"></A>there happened to be a Thesprotian ship sailing for the wheat-growing island 
<A NAME="254"></A>of Dulichium, and he told those in charge of her to be sure and take me 
<A NAME="255"></A>safely to King Acastus.
<A NAME="256"></A><BR><BR>"These men hatched a plot against me that would have reduced me 
<A NAME="257"></A>to the very extreme of misery, for when the ship had got some way out from 
<A NAME="258"></A>land they resolved on selling me as a slave. They stripped me of the shirt 
<A NAME="259"></A>and cloak that I was wearing, and gave me instead the tattered old clouts 
<A NAME="260"></A>in which you now see me; then, towards nightfall, they reached the tilled 
<A NAME="261"></A>lands of Ithaca, and there they bound me with a strong rope fast in the 
<A NAME="262"></A>ship, while they went on shore to get supper by the sea side. But the gods 
<A NAME="263"></A>soon undid my bonds for me, and having drawn my rags over my head I slid 
<A NAME="264"></A>down the rudder into the sea, where I struck out and swam till I was well 
<A NAME="265"></A>clear of them, and came ashore near a thick wood in which I lay concealed. 
<A NAME="266"></A>They were very angry at my having escaped and went searching about for 
<A NAME="267"></A>me, till at last they thought it was no further use and went back to their 
<A NAME="268"></A>ship. The gods, having hidden me thus easily, then took me to a good man's 
<A NAME="269"></A>door- for it seems that I am not to die yet awhile."
<A NAME="270"></A><BR><BR>To this you answered, O swineherd Eumaeus, "Poor unhappy stranger, 
<A NAME="271"></A>I have found the story of your misfortunes extremely interesting, but that 
<A NAME="272"></A>part about Ulysses is not right; and you will never get me to believe it. 
<A NAME="273"></A>Why should a man like you go about telling lies in this way? I know all 
<A NAME="274"></A>about the return of my master. The gods one and all of them detest him, 
<A NAME="275"></A>or they would have taken him before Troy, or let him die with friends around 
<A NAME="276"></A>him when the days of his fighting were done; for then the Achaeans would 
<A NAME="277"></A>have built a mound over his ashes and his son would have been heir to his 
<A NAME="278"></A>renown, but now the storm winds have spirited him away we know not 
<A NAME="279"></A>whither.
<A NAME="280"></A><BR><BR>"As for me I live out of the way here with the pigs, and never 
<A NAME="281"></A>go to the town unless when Penelope sends for me on the arrival of some 
<A NAME="282"></A>news about Ulysses. Then they all sit round and ask questions, both those 
<A NAME="283"></A>who grieve over the king's absence, and those who rejoice at it because 
<A NAME="284"></A>they can eat up his property without paying for it. For my own part I have 
<A NAME="285"></A>never cared about asking anyone else since the time when I was taken in 
<A NAME="286"></A>by an Aetolian, who had killed a man and come a long way till at last he 
<A NAME="287"></A>reached my station, and I was very kind to him. He said he had seen Ulysses 
<A NAME="288"></A>with Idomeneus among the Cretans, refitting his ships which had been damaged 
<A NAME="289"></A>in a gale. He said Ulysses would return in the following summer or autumn 
<A NAME="290"></A>with his men, and that he would bring back much wealth. And now you, you 
<A NAME="291"></A>unfortunate old man, since fate has brought you to my door, do not try 
<A NAME="292"></A>to flatter me in this way with vain hopes. It is not for any such reason 
<A NAME="293"></A>that I shall treat you kindly, but only out of respect for Jove the god 
<A NAME="294"></A>of hospitality, as fearing him and pitying you."
<A NAME="295"></A><BR><BR>Ulysses answered, "I see that you are of an unbelieving mind; I 
<A NAME="296"></A>have given you my oath, and yet you will not credit me; let us then make 
<A NAME="297"></A>a bargain, and call all the gods in heaven to witness it. If your master 
<A NAME="298"></A>comes home, give me a cloak and shirt of good wear, and send me to Dulichium 
<A NAME="299"></A>where I want to go; but if he does not come as I say he will, set your 
<A NAME="300"></A>men on to me, and tell them to throw me from yonder precepice, as a warning 
<A NAME="301"></A>to tramps not to go about the country telling lies."
<A NAME="302"></A><BR><BR>"And a pretty figure I should cut then," replied Eumaeus, both 
<A NAME="303"></A>now and hereafter, if I were to kill you after receiving you into my hut 
<A NAME="304"></A>and showing you hospitality. I should have to say my prayers in good earnest 
<A NAME="305"></A>if I did; but it is just supper time and I hope my men will come in directly, 
<A NAME="306"></A>that we may cook something savoury for supper."
<A NAME="307"></A><BR><BR>Thus did they converse, and presently the swineherds came up with 
<A NAME="308"></A>the pigs, which were then shut up for the night in their sties, and a tremendous 
<A NAME="309"></A>squealing they made as they were being driven into them. But Eumaeus called 
<A NAME="310"></A>to his men and said, "Bring in the best pig you have, that I may sacrifice 
<A NAME="311"></A>for this stranger, and we will take toll of him ourselves. We have had 
<A NAME="312"></A>trouble enough this long time feeding pigs, while others reap the fruit 
<A NAME="313"></A>of our labour."
<A NAME="314"></A><BR><BR>On this he began chopping firewood, while the others brought in 
<A NAME="315"></A>a fine fat five year old boar pig, and set it at the altar. Eumaeus did 
<A NAME="316"></A>not forget the gods, for he was a man of good principles, so the first 
<A NAME="317"></A>thing he did was to cut bristles from the pig's face and throw them into 
<A NAME="318"></A>the fire, praying to all the gods as he did so that Ulysses might return 
<A NAME="319"></A>home again. Then he clubbed the pig with a billet of oak which he had kept 
<A NAME="320"></A>back when he was chopping the firewood, and stunned it, while the others 
<A NAME="321"></A>slaughtered and singed it. Then they cut it up, and Eumaeus began by putting 
<A NAME="322"></A>raw pieces from each joint on to some of the fat; these he sprinkled with 
<A NAME="323"></A>barley meal, and laid upon the embers; they cut the rest of the meat up 
<A NAME="324"></A>small, put the pieces upon the spits and roasted them till they were done; 
<A NAME="325"></A>when they had taken them off the spits they threw them on to the dresser 
<A NAME="326"></A>in a heap. The swineherd, who was a most equitable man, then stood up to 
<A NAME="327"></A>give every one his share. He made seven portions; one of these he set apart 
<A NAME="328"></A>for Mercury the son of Maia and the nymphs, praying to them as he did so; 
<A NAME="329"></A>the others he dealt out to the men man by man. He gave Ulysses some slices 
<A NAME="330"></A>cut lengthways down the loin as a mark of especial honour, and Ulysses 
<A NAME="331"></A>was much pleased. "I hope, Eumaeus," said he, "that Jove will be as well 
<A NAME="332"></A>disposed towards you as I am, for the respect you are showing to an outcast 
<A NAME="333"></A>like myself."
<A NAME="334"></A><BR><BR>To this you answered, O swineherd Eumaeus, "Eat, my good fellow, 
<A NAME="335"></A>and enjoy your supper, such as it is. God grants this, and withholds that, 
<A NAME="336"></A>just as he thinks right, for he can do whatever he chooses."
<A NAME="337"></A><BR><BR>As he spoke he cut off the first piece and offered it as a burnt 
<A NAME="338"></A>sacrifice to the immortal gods; then he made them a drink-offering, put 
<A NAME="339"></A>the cup in the hands of Ulysses, and sat down to his own portion. Mesaulius 
<A NAME="340"></A>brought them their bread; the swineherd had bought this man on his own 
<A NAME="341"></A>account from among the Taphians during his master's absence, and had paid 
<A NAME="342"></A>for him with his own money without saying anything either to his mistress 
<A NAME="343"></A>or Laertes. They then laid their hands upon the good things that were before 
<A NAME="344"></A>them, and when they had had enough to eat and drink, Mesaulius took away 
<A NAME="345"></A>what was left of the bread, and they all went to bed after having made 
<A NAME="346"></A>a hearty supper.
<A NAME="347"></A><BR><BR>Now the night came on stormy and very dark, for there was no moon. 
<A NAME="348"></A>It poured without ceasing, and the wind blew strong from the West, which 
<A NAME="349"></A>is a wet quarter, so Ulysses thought he would see whether Eumaeus, in the 
<A NAME="350"></A>excellent care he took of him, would take off his own cloak and give it 
<A NAME="351"></A>him, or make one of his men give him one. "Listen to me," said he, "Eumaeus 
<A NAME="352"></A>and the rest of you; when I have said a prayer I will tell you something. 
<A NAME="353"></A>It is the wine that makes me talk in this way; wine will make even a wise 
<A NAME="354"></A>man fall to singing; it will make him chuckle and dance and say many a 
<A NAME="355"></A>word that he had better leave unspoken; still, as I have begun, I will 
<A NAME="356"></A>go on. Would that I were still young and strong as when we got up an ambuscade 
<A NAME="357"></A>before Troy. Menelaus and Ulysses were the leaders, but I was in command 
<A NAME="358"></A>also, for the other two would have it so. When we had come up to the wall 
<A NAME="359"></A>of the city we crouched down beneath our armour and lay there under cover 
<A NAME="360"></A>of the reeds and thick brush-wood that grew about the swamp. It came on 
<A NAME="361"></A>to freeze with a North wind blowing; the snow fell small and fine like 
<A NAME="362"></A>hoar frost, and our shields were coated thick with rime. The others had 
<A NAME="363"></A>all got cloaks and shirts, and slept comfortably enough with their shields 
<A NAME="364"></A>about their shoulders, but I had carelessly left my cloak behind me, not 
<A NAME="365"></A>thinking that I should be too cold, and had gone off in nothing but my 
<A NAME="366"></A>shirt and shield. When the night was two-thirds through and the stars had 
<A NAME="367"></A>shifted their their places, I nudged Ulysses who was close to me with my 
<A NAME="368"></A>elbow, and he at once gave me his ear.
<A NAME="369"></A><BR><BR>"'Ulysses,' said I, 'this cold will be the death of me, for I have 
<A NAME="370"></A>no cloak; some god fooled me into setting off with nothing on but my shirt, 
<A NAME="371"></A>and I do not know what to do.'
<A NAME="372"></A><BR><BR>"Ulysses, who was as crafty as he was valiant, hit upon the following 
<A NAME="373"></A>plan:
<A NAME="374"></A><BR><BR>"'Keep still,' said he in a low voice, 'or the others will hear 
<A NAME="375"></A>you.' Then he raised his head on his elbow.
<A NAME="376"></A><BR><BR>"'My friends,' said he, 'I have had a dream from heaven in my sleep. 
<A NAME="377"></A>We are a long way from the ships; I wish some one would go down and tell 
<A NAME="378"></A>Agamemnon to send us up more men at once.'
<A NAME="379"></A><BR><BR>"On this Thoas son of Andraemon threw off his cloak and set out 
<A NAME="380"></A>running to the ships, whereon I took the cloak and lay in it comfortably 
<A NAME="381"></A>enough till morning. Would that I were still young and strong as I was 
<A NAME="382"></A>in those days, for then some one of you swineherds would give me a cloak 
<A NAME="383"></A>both out of good will and for the respect due to a brave soldier; but now 
<A NAME="384"></A>people look down upon me because my clothes are shabby."
<A NAME="385"></A><BR><BR>And Eumaeus answered, "Old man, you have told us an excellent story, 
<A NAME="386"></A>and have said nothing so far but what is quite satisfactory; for the present, 
<A NAME="387"></A>therefore, you shall want neither clothing nor anything else that a stranger 
<A NAME="388"></A>in distress may reasonably expect, but to-morrow morning you have to shake 
<A NAME="389"></A>your own old rags about your body again, for we have not many spare cloaks 
<A NAME="390"></A>nor shirts up here, but every man has only one. When Ulysses' son comes 
<A NAME="391"></A>home again he will give you both cloak and shirt, and send you wherever 
<A NAME="392"></A>you may want to go."
<A NAME="393"></A><BR><BR>With this he got up and made a bed for Ulysses by throwing some 
<A NAME="394"></A>goatskins and sheepskins on the ground in front of the fire. Here Ulysses 
<A NAME="395"></A>lay down, and Eumaeus covered him over with a great heavy cloak that he 
<A NAME="396"></A>kept for a change in case of extraordinarily bad weather.
<A NAME="397"></A><BR><BR>Thus did Ulysses sleep, and the young men slept beside him. But 
<A NAME="398"></A>the swineherd did not like sleeping away from his pigs, so he got ready 
<A NAME="399"></A>to go and Ulysses was glad to see that he looked after his property during 
<A NAME="400"></A>his master's absence. First he slung his sword over his brawny shoulders 
<A NAME="401"></A>and put on a thick cloak to keep out the wind. He also took the skin of 
<A NAME="402"></A>a large and well fed goat, and a javelin in case of attack from men or 
<A NAME="403"></A>dogs. Thus equipped he went to his rest where the pigs were camping under 
<A NAME="404"></A>an overhanging rock that gave them shelter from the North 
<A NAME="405"></A>wind.
