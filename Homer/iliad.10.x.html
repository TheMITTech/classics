<A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A>Now the other princes of the Achaeans slept soundly the whole night through, 
<A NAME="11"></A>but Agamemnon son of Atreus was troubled, so that he could get no rest. 
<A NAME="12"></A>As when fair Juno's lord flashes his lightning in token of great rain or 
<A NAME="13"></A>hail or snow when the snow-flakes whiten the ground, or again as a sign 
<A NAME="14"></A>that he will open the wide jaws of hungry war, even so did Agamemnon heave 
<A NAME="15"></A>many a heavy sigh, for his soul trembled within him. When he looked upon 
<A NAME="16"></A>the plain of Troy he marvelled at the many watchfires burning in front 
<A NAME="17"></A>of Ilius, and at the sound of pipes and flutes and of the hum of men, but 
<A NAME="18"></A>when presently he turned towards the ships and hosts of the Achaeans, he 
<A NAME="19"></A>tore his hair by handfuls before Jove on high, and groaned aloud for the 
<A NAME="20"></A>very disquietness of his soul. In the end he deemed it best to go at once 
<A NAME="21"></A>to Nestor son of Neleus, and see if between them they could find any way 
<A NAME="22"></A>of the Achaeans from destruction. He therefore rose, put on his shirt, 
<A NAME="23"></A>bound his sandals about his comely feet, flung the skin of a huge tawny 
<A NAME="24"></A>lion over his shoulders- a skin that reached his feet- and took his spear 
<A NAME="25"></A>in his hand.
<A NAME="26"></A><BR><BR>Neither could Menelaus sleep, for he, too, boded ill for the Argives 
<A NAME="27"></A>who for his sake had sailed from far over the seas to fight the Trojans. 
<A NAME="28"></A>He covered his broad back with the skin of a spotted panther, put a casque 
<A NAME="29"></A>of bronze upon his head, and took his spear in his brawny hand. Then he 
<A NAME="30"></A>went to rouse his brother, who was by far the most powerful of the Achaeans, 
<A NAME="31"></A>and was honoured by the people as though he were a god. He found him by 
<A NAME="32"></A>the stern of his ship already putting his goodly array about his shoulders, 
<A NAME="33"></A>and right glad was he that his brother had come.
<A NAME="34"></A><BR><BR>Menelaus spoke first. "Why," said he, "my dear brother, are you 
<A NAME="35"></A>thus arming? Are you going to send any of our comrades to exploit the Trojans? 
<A NAME="36"></A>I greatly fear that no one will do you this service, and spy upon the enemy 
<A NAME="37"></A>alone in the dead of night. It will be a deed of great 
<A NAME="38"></A>daring."
<A NAME="39"></A><BR><BR>And King Agamemnon answered, "Menelaus, we both of us need shrewd 
<A NAME="40"></A>counsel to save the Argives and our ships, for Jove has changed his mind, 
<A NAME="41"></A>and inclines towards Hector's sacrifices rather than ours. I never saw 
<A NAME="42"></A>nor heard tell of any man as having wrought such ruin in one day as Hector 
<A NAME="43"></A>has now wrought against the sons of the Achaeans- and that too of his own 
<A NAME="44"></A>unaided self, for he is son neither to god nor goddess. The Argives will 
<A NAME="45"></A>rue it long and deeply. Run, therefore, with all speed by the line of the 
<A NAME="46"></A>ships, and call Ajax and Idomeneus. Meanwhile I will go to Nestor, and 
<A NAME="47"></A>bid him rise and go about among the companies of our sentinels to give 
<A NAME="48"></A>them their instructions; they will listen to him sooner than to any man, 
<A NAME="49"></A>for his own son, and Meriones brother in arms to Idomeneus, are captains 
<A NAME="50"></A>over them. It was to them more particularly that we gave this 
<A NAME="51"></A>charge."
<A NAME="52"></A><BR><BR>Menelaus replied, "How do I take your meaning? Am I to stay with 
<A NAME="53"></A>them and wait your coming, or shall I return here as soon as I have given 
<A NAME="54"></A>your orders?" "Wait," answered King Agamemnon, "for there are so many paths 
<A NAME="55"></A>about the camp that we might miss one another. Call every man on your way, 
<A NAME="56"></A>and bid him be stirring; name him by his lineage and by his father's name, 
<A NAME="57"></A>give each all titular observance, and stand not too much upon your own 
<A NAME="58"></A>dignity; we must take our full share of toil, for at our birth Jove laid 
<A NAME="59"></A>this heavy burden upon us."
<A NAME="60"></A><BR><BR>With these instructions he sent his brother on his way, and went 
<A NAME="61"></A>on to Nestor shepherd of his people. He found him sleeping in his tent 
<A NAME="62"></A>hard by his own ship; his goodly armour lay beside him- his shield, his 
<A NAME="63"></A>two spears and his helmet; beside him also lay the gleaming girdle with 
<A NAME="64"></A>which the old man girded himself when he armed to lead his people into 
<A NAME="65"></A>battle- for his age stayed him not. He raised himself on his elbow and 
<A NAME="66"></A>looked up at Agamemnon. "Who is it," said he, "that goes thus about the 
<A NAME="67"></A>host and the ships alone and in the dead of night, when men are sleeping? 
<A NAME="68"></A>Are you looking for one of your mules or for some comrade? Do not stand 
<A NAME="69"></A>there and say nothing, but speak. What is your business?"
<A NAME="70"></A><BR><BR>And Agamemnon answered, "Nestor, son of Neleus, honour to the Achaean 
<A NAME="71"></A>name, it is I, Agamemnon son of Atreus, on whom Jove has laid labour and 
<A NAME="72"></A>sorrow so long as there is breath in my body and my limbs carry me. I am 
<A NAME="73"></A>thus abroad because sleep sits not upon my eyelids, but my heart is big 
<A NAME="74"></A>with war and with the jeopardy of the Achaeans. I am in great fear for 
<A NAME="75"></A>the Danaans. I am at sea, and without sure counsel; my heart beats as though 
<A NAME="76"></A>it would leap out of my body, and my limbs fail me. If then you can do 
<A NAME="77"></A>anything- for you too cannot sleep- let us go the round of the watch, and 
<A NAME="78"></A>see whether they are drowsy with toil and sleeping to the neglect of their 
<A NAME="79"></A>duty. The enemy is encamped hard and we know not but he may attack us by 
<A NAME="80"></A>night."
<A NAME="81"></A><BR><BR>Nestor replied, "Most noble son of Atreus, king of men, Agamemnon, 
<A NAME="82"></A>Jove will not do all for Hector that Hector thinks he will; he will have 
<A NAME="83"></A>troubles yet in plenty if Achilles will lay aside his anger. I will go 
<A NAME="84"></A>with you, and we will rouse others, either the son of Tydeus, or Ulysses, 
<A NAME="85"></A>or fleet Ajax and the valiant son of Phyleus. Some one had also better 
<A NAME="86"></A>go and call Ajax and King Idomeneus, for their ships are not near at hand 
<A NAME="87"></A>but the farthest of all. I cannot however refrain from blaming Menelaus, 
<A NAME="88"></A>much as I love him and respect him- and I will say so plainly, even at 
<A NAME="89"></A>the risk of offending you- for sleeping and leaving all this trouble to 
<A NAME="90"></A>yourself. He ought to be going about imploring aid from all the princes 
<A NAME="91"></A>of the Achaeans, for we are in extreme danger."
<A NAME="92"></A><BR><BR>And Agamemnon answered, "Sir, you may sometimes blame him justly, 
<A NAME="93"></A>for he is often remiss and unwilling to exert himself- not indeed from 
<A NAME="94"></A>sloth, nor yet heedlessness, but because he looks to me and expects me 
<A NAME="95"></A>to take the lead. On this occasion, however, he was awake before I was, 
<A NAME="96"></A>and came to me of his own accord. I have already sent him to call the very 
<A NAME="97"></A>men whom you have named. And now let us be going. We shall find them with 
<A NAME="98"></A>the watch outside the gates, for it was there I said that we would meet 
<A NAME="99"></A>them."
<A NAME="100"></A><BR><BR>"In that case," answered Nestor, "the Argives will not blame him 
<A NAME="101"></A>nor disobey his orders when he urges them to fight or gives them 
<A NAME="102"></A>instructions."
<A NAME="103"></A><BR><BR>With this he put on his shirt, and bound his sandals about his 
<A NAME="104"></A>comely feet. He buckled on his purple coat, of two thicknesses, large, 
<A NAME="105"></A>and of a rough shaggy texture, grasped his redoubtable bronze-shod spear, 
<A NAME="106"></A>and wended his way along the line of the Achaean ships. First he called 
<A NAME="107"></A>loudly to Ulysses peer of gods in counsel and woke him, for he was soon 
<A NAME="108"></A>roused by the sound of the battle-cry. He came outside his tent and said, 
<A NAME="109"></A>"Why do you go thus alone about the host, and along the line of the ships 
<A NAME="110"></A>in the stillness of the night? What is it that you find so urgent?" And 
<A NAME="111"></A>Nestor knight of Gerene answered, "Ulysses, noble son of Laertes, take 
<A NAME="112"></A>it not amiss, for the Achaeans are in great straits. Come with me and let 
<A NAME="113"></A>us wake some other, who may advise well with us whether we shall fight 
<A NAME="114"></A>or fly."
<A NAME="115"></A><BR><BR>On this Ulysses went at once into his tent, put his shield about 
<A NAME="116"></A>his shoulders and came out with them. First they went to Diomed son of 
<A NAME="117"></A>Tydeus, and found him outside his tent clad in his armour with his comrades 
<A NAME="118"></A>sleeping round him and using their shields as pillows; as for their spears, 
<A NAME="119"></A>they stood upright on the spikes of their butts that were driven into the 
<A NAME="120"></A>ground, and the burnished bronze flashed afar like the lightning of father 
<A NAME="121"></A>Jove. The hero was sleeping upon the skin of an ox, with a piece of fine 
<A NAME="122"></A>carpet under his head; Nestor went up to him and stirred him with his heel 
<A NAME="123"></A>to rouse him, upbraiding him and urging him to bestir himself. "Wake up," 
<A NAME="124"></A>he exclaimed, "son of Tydeus. How can you sleep on in this way? Can you 
<A NAME="125"></A>not see that the Trojans are encamped on the brow of the plain hard by 
<A NAME="126"></A>our ships, with but a little space between us and them?"
<A NAME="127"></A><BR><BR>On these words Diomed leaped up instantly and said, "Old man, your 
<A NAME="128"></A>heart is of iron; you rest not one moment from your labours. Are there 
<A NAME="129"></A>no younger men among the Achaeans who could go about to rouse the princes? 
<A NAME="130"></A>There is no tiring you."
<A NAME="131"></A><BR><BR>And Nestor knight of Gerene made answer, "My son, all that you 
<A NAME="132"></A>have said is true. I have good sons, and also much people who might call 
<A NAME="133"></A>the chieftains, but the Achaeans are in the gravest danger; life and death 
<A NAME="134"></A>are balanced as it were on the edge of a razor. Go then, for you are younger 
<A NAME="135"></A>than I, and of your courtesy rouse Ajax and the fleet son of 
<A NAME="136"></A>Phyleus."
<A NAME="137"></A><BR><BR>Diomed threw the skin of a great tawny lion about his shoulders- 
<A NAME="138"></A>a skin that reached his feet- and grasped his spear. When he had roused 
<A NAME="139"></A>the heroes, he brought them back with him; they then went the round of 
<A NAME="140"></A>those who were on guard, and found the captains not sleeping at their posts 
<A NAME="141"></A>but wakeful and sitting with their arms about them. As sheep dogs that 
<A NAME="142"></A>watch their flocks when they are yarded, and hear a wild beast coming through 
<A NAME="143"></A>the mountain forest towards them- forthwith there is a hue and cry of dogs 
<A NAME="144"></A>and men, and slumber is broken- even so was sleep chased from the eyes 
<A NAME="145"></A>of the Achaeans as they kept the watches of the wicked night, for they 
<A NAME="146"></A>turned constantly towards the plain whenever they heard any stir among 
<A NAME="147"></A>the Trojans. The old man was glad bade them be of good cheer. "Watch on, 
<A NAME="148"></A>my children," said he, "and let not sleep get hold upon you, lest our enemies 
<A NAME="149"></A>triumph over us."
<A NAME="150"></A><BR><BR>With this he passed the trench, and with him the other chiefs of 
<A NAME="151"></A>the Achaeans who had been called to the council. Meriones and the brave 
<A NAME="152"></A>son of Nestor went also, for the princes bade them. When they were beyond 
<A NAME="153"></A>the trench that was dug round the wall they held their meeting on the open 
<A NAME="154"></A>ground where there was a space clear of corpses, for it was here that when 
<A NAME="155"></A>night fell Hector had turned back from his onslaught on the Argives. They 
<A NAME="156"></A>sat down, therefore, and held debate with one another.
<A NAME="157"></A><BR><BR>Nestor spoke first. "My friends," said he, "is there any man bold 
<A NAME="158"></A>enough to venture the Trojans, and cut off some straggler, or us news of 
<A NAME="159"></A>what the enemy mean to do whether they will stay here by the ships away 
<A NAME="160"></A>from the city, or whether, now that they have worsted the Achaeans, they 
<A NAME="161"></A>will retire within their walls. If he could learn all this and come back 
<A NAME="162"></A>safely here, his fame would be high as heaven in the mouths of all men, 
<A NAME="163"></A>and he would be rewarded richly; for the chiefs from all our ships would 
<A NAME="164"></A>each of them give him a black ewe with her lamb- which is a present of 
<A NAME="165"></A>surpassing value- and he would be asked as a guest to all feasts and 
<A NAME="166"></A>clan-gatherings."
<A NAME="167"></A><BR><BR>They all held their peace, but Diomed of the loud war-cry spoke 
<A NAME="168"></A>saying, "Nestor, gladly will I visit the host of the Trojans over against 
<A NAME="169"></A>us, but if another will go with me I shall do so in greater confidence 
<A NAME="170"></A>and comfort. When two men are together, one of them may see some opportunity 
<A NAME="171"></A>which the other has not caught sight of; if a man is alone he is less full 
<A NAME="172"></A>of resource, and his wit is weaker."
<A NAME="173"></A><BR><BR>On this several offered to go with Diomed. The two Ajaxes, servants 
<A NAME="174"></A>of Mars, Meriones, and the son of Nestor all wanted to go, so did Menelaus 
<A NAME="175"></A>son of Atreus; Ulysses also wished to go among the host of the Trojans, 
<A NAME="176"></A>for he was ever full of daring, and thereon Agamemnon king of men spoke 
<A NAME="177"></A>thus: "Diomed," said he, "son of Tydeus, man after my own heart, choose 
<A NAME="178"></A>your comrade for yourself- take the best man of those that have offered, 
<A NAME="179"></A>for many would now go with you. Do not through delicacy reject the better 
<A NAME="180"></A>man, and take the worst out of respect for his lineage, because he is of 
<A NAME="181"></A>more royal blood."
<A NAME="182"></A><BR><BR>He said this because he feared for Menelaus. Diomed answered, "If 
<A NAME="183"></A>you bid me take the man of my own choice, how in that case can I fail to 
<A NAME="184"></A>think of Ulysses, than whom there is no man more eager to face all kinds 
<A NAME="185"></A>of danger- and Pallas Minerva loves him well? If he were to go with me 
<A NAME="186"></A>we should pass safely through fire itself, for he is quick to see and 
<A NAME="187"></A>understand."
<A NAME="188"></A><BR><BR>"Son of Tydeus," replied Ulysses, "say neither good nor ill about 
<A NAME="189"></A>me, for you are among Argives who know me well. Let us be going, for the 
<A NAME="190"></A>night wanes and dawn is at hand. The stars have gone forward, two-thirds 
<A NAME="191"></A>of the night are already spent, and the third is alone left 
<A NAME="192"></A>us."
<A NAME="193"></A><BR><BR>They then put on their armour. Brave Thrasymedes provided the son 
<A NAME="194"></A>of Tydeus with a sword and a shield (for he had left his own at his ship) 
<A NAME="195"></A>and on his head he set a helmet of bull's hide without either peak or crest; 
<A NAME="196"></A>it is called a skull-cap and is a common headgear. Meriones found a bow 
<A NAME="197"></A>and quiver for Ulysses, and on his head he set a leathern helmet that was 
<A NAME="198"></A>lined with a strong plaiting of leathern thongs, while on the outside it 
<A NAME="199"></A>was thickly studded with boar's teeth, well and skilfully set into it; 
<A NAME="200"></A>next the head there was an inner lining of felt. This helmet had been stolen 
<A NAME="201"></A>by Autolycus out of Eleon when he broke into the house of Amyntor son of 
<A NAME="202"></A>Ormenus. He gave it to Amphidamas of Cythera to take to Scandea, and Amphidamas 
<A NAME="203"></A>gave it as a guest-gift to Molus, who gave it to his son Meriones; and 
<A NAME="204"></A>now it was set upon the head of Ulysses.
<A NAME="205"></A><BR><BR>When the pair had armed, they set out, and left the other chieftains 
<A NAME="206"></A>behind them. Pallas Minerva sent them a heron by the wayside upon their 
<A NAME="207"></A>right hands; they could not see it for the darkness, but they heard its 
<A NAME="208"></A>cry. Ulysses was glad when he heard it and prayed to Minerva: "Hear me," 
<A NAME="209"></A>he cried, "daughter of aegis-bearing Jove, you who spy out all my ways 
<A NAME="210"></A>and who are with me in all my hardships; befriend me in this mine hour, 
<A NAME="211"></A>and grant that we may return to the ships covered with glory after having 
<A NAME="212"></A>achieved some mighty exploit that shall bring sorrow to the 
<A NAME="213"></A>Trojans."
<A NAME="214"></A><BR><BR>Then Diomed of the loud war-cry also prayed: "Hear me too," said 
<A NAME="215"></A>he, "daughter of Jove, unweariable; be with me even as you were with my 
<A NAME="216"></A>noble father Tydeus when he went to Thebes as envoy sent by the Achaeans. 
<A NAME="217"></A>He left the Achaeans by the banks of the river Aesopus, and went to the 
<A NAME="218"></A>city bearing a message of peace to the Cadmeians; on his return thence, 
<A NAME="219"></A>with your help, goddess, he did great deeds of daring, for you were his 
<A NAME="220"></A>ready helper. Even so guide me and guard me now, and in return I will offer 
<A NAME="221"></A>you in sacrifice a broad-browed heifer of a year old, unbroken, and never 
<A NAME="222"></A>yet brought by man under the yoke. I will gild her horns and will offer 
<A NAME="223"></A>her up to you in sacrifice."
<A NAME="224"></A><BR><BR>Thus they prayed, and Pallas Minerva heard their prayer. When they 
<A NAME="225"></A>had done praying to the daughter of great Jove, they went their way like 
<A NAME="226"></A>two lions prowling by night amid the armour and blood-stained bodies of 
<A NAME="227"></A>them that had fallen.
<A NAME="228"></A><BR><BR>Neither again did Hector let the Trojans sleep; for he too called 
<A NAME="229"></A>the princes and councillors of the Trojans that he might set his counsel 
<A NAME="230"></A>before them. "Is there one," said he, "who for a great reward will do me 
<A NAME="231"></A>the service of which I will tell you? He shall be well paid if he will. 
<A NAME="232"></A>I will give him a chariot and a couple of horses, the fleetest that can 
<A NAME="233"></A>be found at the ships of the Achaeans, if he will dare this thing; and 
<A NAME="234"></A>he will win infinite honour to boot; he must go to the ships and find out 
<A NAME="235"></A>whether they are still guarded as heretofore, or whether now that we have 
<A NAME="236"></A>beaten them the Achaeans design to fly, and through sheer exhaustion are 
<A NAME="237"></A>neglecting to keep their watches."
<A NAME="238"></A><BR><BR>They all held their peace; but there was among the Trojans a certain 
<A NAME="239"></A>man named Dolon, son of Eumedes, the famous herald- a man rich in gold 
<A NAME="240"></A>and bronze. He was ill-favoured, but a good runner, and was an only son 
<A NAME="241"></A>among five sisters. He it was that now addressed the Trojans. "I, Hector," 
<A NAME="242"></A>said he, "Will to the ships and will exploit them. But first hold up your 
<A NAME="243"></A>sceptre and swear that you will give me the chariot, bedight with bronze, 
<A NAME="244"></A>and the horses that now carry the noble son of Peleus. I will make you 
<A NAME="245"></A>a good scout, and will not fail you. I will go through the host from one 
<A NAME="246"></A>end to the other till I come to the ship of Agamemnon, where I take it 
<A NAME="247"></A>the princes of the Achaeans are now consulting whether they shall fight 
<A NAME="248"></A>or fly."
<A NAME="249"></A><BR><BR>When he had done speaking Hector held up his sceptre, and swore 
<A NAME="250"></A>him his oath saying, "May Jove the thundering husband of Juno bear witness 
<A NAME="251"></A>that no other Trojan but yourself shall mount those steeds, and that you 
<A NAME="252"></A>shall have your will with them for ever."
<A NAME="253"></A><BR><BR>The oath he swore was bootless, but it made Dolon more keen on 
<A NAME="254"></A>going. He hung his bow over his shoulder, and as an overall he wore the 
<A NAME="255"></A>skin of a grey wolf, while on his head he set a cap of ferret skin. Then 
<A NAME="256"></A>he took a pointed javelin, and left the camp for the ships, but he was 
<A NAME="257"></A>not to return with any news for Hector. When he had left the horses and 
<A NAME="258"></A>the troops behind him, he made all speed on his way, but Ulysses perceived 
<A NAME="259"></A>his coming and said to Diomed, "Diomed, here is some one from the camp; 
<A NAME="260"></A>I am not sure whether he is a spy, or whether it is some thief who would 
<A NAME="261"></A>plunder the bodies of the dead; let him get a little past us, we can then 
<A NAME="262"></A>spring upon him and take him. If, however, he is too quick for us, go after 
<A NAME="263"></A>him with your spear and hem him in towards the ships away from the Trojan 
<A NAME="264"></A>camp, to prevent his getting back to the town."
<A NAME="265"></A><BR><BR>With this they turned out of their way and lay down among the corpses. 
<A NAME="266"></A>Dolon suspected nothing and soon passed them, but when he had got about 
<A NAME="267"></A>as far as the distance by which a mule-plowed furrow exceeds one that has 
<A NAME="268"></A>been ploughed by oxen (for mules can plow fallow land quicker than oxen) 
<A NAME="269"></A>they ran after him, and when he heard their footsteps he stood still, for 
<A NAME="270"></A>he made sure they were friends from the Trojan camp come by Hector's orders 
<A NAME="271"></A>to bid him return; when, however, they were only a spear's cast, or less 
<A NAME="272"></A>away form him, he saw that they were enemies as fast as his legs could 
<A NAME="273"></A>take him. The others gave chase at once, and as a couple of well-trained 
<A NAME="274"></A>hounds press forward after a doe or hare that runs screaming in front of 
<A NAME="275"></A>them, even so did the son of Tydeus and Ulysses pursue Dolon and cut him 
<A NAME="276"></A>off from his own people. But when he had fled so far towards the ships 
<A NAME="277"></A>that he would soon have fallen in with the outposts, Minerva infused fresh 
<A NAME="278"></A>strength into the son of Tydeus for fear some other of the Achaeans might 
<A NAME="279"></A>have the glory of being first to hit him, and he might himself be only 
<A NAME="280"></A>second; he therefore sprang forward with his spear and said, "Stand, or 
<A NAME="281"></A>I shall throw my spear, and in that case I shall soon make an end of 
<A NAME="282"></A>you."
<A NAME="283"></A><BR><BR>He threw as he spoke, but missed his aim on purpose. The dart flew 
<A NAME="284"></A>over the man's right shoulder, and then stuck in the ground. He stood stock 
<A NAME="285"></A>still, trembling and in great fear; his teeth chattered, and he turned 
<A NAME="286"></A>pale with fear. The two came breathless up to him and seized his hands, 
<A NAME="287"></A>whereon he began to weep and said, "Take me alive; I will ransom myself; 
<A NAME="288"></A>we have great store of gold, bronze, and wrought iron, and from this my 
<A NAME="289"></A>father will satisfy you with a very large ransom, should he hear of my 
<A NAME="290"></A>being alive at the ships of the Achaeans."
<A NAME="291"></A><BR><BR>"Fear not," replied Ulysses, "let no thought of death be in your 
<A NAME="292"></A>mind; but tell me, and tell me true, why are you thus going about alone 
<A NAME="293"></A>in the dead of night away from your camp and towards the ships, while other 
<A NAME="294"></A>men are sleeping? Is it to plunder the bodies of the slain, or did Hector 
<A NAME="295"></A>send you to spy out what was going on at the ships? Or did you come here 
<A NAME="296"></A>of your own mere notion?"
<A NAME="297"></A><BR><BR>Dolon answered, his limbs trembling beneath him: "Hector, with 
<A NAME="298"></A>his vain flattering promises, lured me from my better judgement. He said 
<A NAME="299"></A>he would give me the horses of the noble son of Peleus and his bronze-bedizened 
<A NAME="300"></A>chariot; he bade me go through the darkness of the flying night, get close 
<A NAME="301"></A>to the enemy, and find out whether the ships are still guarded as heretofore, 
<A NAME="302"></A>or whether, now that we have beaten them, the Achaeans design to fly, and 
<A NAME="303"></A>through sheer exhaustion are neglecting to keep their 
<A NAME="304"></A>watches."
<A NAME="305"></A><BR><BR>Ulysses smiled at him and answered, "You had indeed set your heart 
<A NAME="306"></A>upon a great reward, but the horses of the descendant of Aeacus are hardly 
<A NAME="307"></A>to be kept in hand or driven by any other mortal man than Achilles himself, 
<A NAME="308"></A>whose mother was an immortal. But tell me, and tell me true, where did 
<A NAME="309"></A>you leave Hector when you started? Where lies his armour and his horses? 
<A NAME="310"></A>How, too, are the watches and sleeping-ground of the Trojans ordered? What 
<A NAME="311"></A>are their plans? Will they stay here by the ships and away from the city, 
<A NAME="312"></A>or now that they have worsted the Achaeans, will they retire within their 
<A NAME="313"></A>walls?"
<A NAME="314"></A><BR><BR>And Dolon answered, "I will tell you truly all. Hector and the 
<A NAME="315"></A>other councillors are now holding conference by the monument of great Ilus, 
<A NAME="316"></A>away from the general tumult; as for the guards about which you ask me, 
<A NAME="317"></A>there is no chosen watch to keep guard over the host. The Trojans have 
<A NAME="318"></A>their watchfires, for they are bound to have them; they, therefore, are 
<A NAME="319"></A>awake and keep each other to their duty as sentinels; but the allies who 
<A NAME="320"></A>have come from other places are asleep and leave it to the Trojans to keep 
<A NAME="321"></A>guard, for their wives and children are not here."
<A NAME="322"></A><BR><BR>Ulysses then said, "Now tell me; are they sleeping among the Trojan 
<A NAME="323"></A>troops, or do they lie apart? Explain this that I may understand 
<A NAME="324"></A>it."
<A NAME="325"></A><BR><BR>"I will tell you truly all," replied Dolon. "To the seaward lie 
<A NAME="326"></A>the Carians, the Paeonian bowmen, the Leleges, the Cauconians, and the 
<A NAME="327"></A>noble Pelasgi. The Lysians and proud Mysians, with the Phrygians and Meonians, 
<A NAME="328"></A>have their place on the side towards Thymbra; but why ask about an this? 
<A NAME="329"></A>If you want to find your way into the host of the Trojans, there are the 
<A NAME="330"></A>Thracians, who have lately come here and lie apart from the others at the 
<A NAME="331"></A>far end of the camp; and they have Rhesus son of Eioneus for their king. 
<A NAME="332"></A>His horses are the finest and strongest that I have ever seen, they are 
<A NAME="333"></A>whiter than snow and fleeter than any wind that blows. His chariot is bedight 
<A NAME="334"></A>with silver and gold, and he has brought his marvellous golden armour, 
<A NAME="335"></A>of the rarest workmanship- too splendid for any mortal man to carry, and 
<A NAME="336"></A>meet only for the gods. Now, therefore, take me to the ships or bind me 
<A NAME="337"></A>securely here, until you come back and have proved my words whether they 
<A NAME="338"></A>be false or true."
<A NAME="339"></A><BR><BR>Diomed looked sternly at him and answered, "Think not, Dolon, for 
<A NAME="340"></A>all the good information you have given us, that you shall escape now you 
<A NAME="341"></A>are in our hands, for if we ransom you or let you go, you will come some 
<A NAME="342"></A>second time to the ships of the Achaeans either as a spy or as an open 
<A NAME="343"></A>enemy, but if I kill you and an end of you, you will give no more 
<A NAME="344"></A>trouble."
<A NAME="345"></A><BR><BR>On this Dolon would have caught him by the beard to beseech him 
<A NAME="346"></A>further, but Diomed struck him in the middle of his neck with his sword 
<A NAME="347"></A>and cut through both sinews so that his head fell rolling in the dust while 
<A NAME="348"></A>he was yet speaking. They took the ferret-skin cap from his head, and also 
<A NAME="349"></A>the wolf-skin, the bow, and his long spear. Ulysses hung them up aloft 
<A NAME="350"></A>in honour of Minerva the goddess of plunder, and prayed saying, "Accept 
<A NAME="351"></A>these, goddess, for we give them to you in preference to all the gods in 
<A NAME="352"></A>Olympus: therefore speed us still further towards the horses and sleeping-ground 
<A NAME="353"></A>of the Thracians."
<A NAME="354"></A><BR><BR>With these words he took the spoils and set them upon a tamarisk 
<A NAME="355"></A>tree, and they marked the place by pulling up reeds and gathering boughs 
<A NAME="356"></A>of tamarisk that they might not miss it as they came back through the' 
<A NAME="357"></A>flying hours of darkness. The two then went onwards amid the fallen armour 
<A NAME="358"></A>and the blood, and came presently to the company of Thracian soldiers, 
<A NAME="359"></A>who were sleeping, tired out with their day's toil; their goodly armour 
<A NAME="360"></A>was lying on the ground beside them all orderly in three rows, and each 
<A NAME="361"></A>man had his yoke of horses beside him. Rhesus was sleeping in the middle, 
<A NAME="362"></A>and hard by him his horses were made fast to the topmost rim of his chariot. 
<A NAME="363"></A>Ulysses from some way off saw him and said, "This, Diomed, is the man, 
<A NAME="364"></A>and these are the horses about which Dolon whom we killed told us. Do your 
<A NAME="365"></A>very utmost; dally not about your armour, but loose the horses at once- 
<A NAME="366"></A>or else kill the men yourself, while I see to the horses."
<A NAME="367"></A><BR><BR>Thereon Minerva put courage into the heart of Diomed, and he smote 
<A NAME="368"></A>them right and left. They made a hideous groaning as they were being hacked 
<A NAME="369"></A>about, and the earth was red with their blood. As a lion springs furiously 
<A NAME="370"></A>upon a flock of sheep or goats when he finds without their shepherd, so 
<A NAME="371"></A>did the son of Tydeus set upon the Thracian soldiers till he had killed 
<A NAME="372"></A>twelve. As he killed them Ulysses came and drew them aside by their feet 
<A NAME="373"></A>one by one, that the horses might go forward freely without being frightened 
<A NAME="374"></A>as they passed over the dead bodies, for they were not yet used to them. 
<A NAME="375"></A>When the son of Tydeus came to the king, he killed him too (which made 
<A NAME="376"></A>thirteen), as he was breathing hard, for by the counsel of Minerva an evil 
<A NAME="377"></A>dream, the seed of Oeneus, hovered that night over his head. Meanwhile 
<A NAME="378"></A>Ulysses untied the horses, made them fast one to another and drove them 
<A NAME="379"></A>off, striking them with his bow, for he had forgotten to take the whip 
<A NAME="380"></A>from the chariot. Then he whistled as a sign to Diomed.
<A NAME="381"></A><BR><BR>But Diomed stayed where he was, thinking what other daring deed 
<A NAME="382"></A>he might accomplish. He was doubting whether to take the chariot in which 
<A NAME="383"></A>the king's armour was lying, and draw it out by the pole, or to lift the 
<A NAME="384"></A>armour out and carry it off; or whether again, he should not kill some 
<A NAME="385"></A>more Thracians. While he was thus hesitating Minerva came up to him and 
<A NAME="386"></A>said, "Get back, Diomed, to the ships or you may be driven thither, should 
<A NAME="387"></A>some other god rouse the Trojans."
<A NAME="388"></A><BR><BR>Diomed knew that it was the goddess, and at once sprang upon the 
<A NAME="389"></A>horses. Ulysses beat them with his bow and they flew onward to the ships 
<A NAME="390"></A>of the Achaeans.
<A NAME="391"></A><BR><BR>But Apollo kept no blind look-out when he saw Minerva with the 
<A NAME="392"></A>son of Tydeus. He was angry with her, and coming to the host of the Trojans 
<A NAME="393"></A>he roused Hippocoon, a counsellor of the Thracians and a noble kinsman 
<A NAME="394"></A>of Rhesus. He started up out of his sleep and saw that the horses were 
<A NAME="395"></A>no longer in their place, and that the men were gasping in their death-agony; 
<A NAME="396"></A>on this he groaned aloud, and called upon his friend by name. Then the 
<A NAME="397"></A>whole Trojan camp was in an uproar as the people kept hurrying together, 
<A NAME="398"></A>and they marvelled at the deeds of the heroes who had now got away towards 
<A NAME="399"></A>the ships.
<A NAME="400"></A><BR><BR>When they reached the place where they had killed Hector's scout, 
<A NAME="401"></A>Ulysses stayed his horses, and the son of Tydeus, leaping to the ground, 
<A NAME="402"></A>placed the blood-stained spoils in the hands of Ulysses and remounted: 
<A NAME="403"></A>then he lashed the horses onwards, and they flew forward nothing loth towards 
<A NAME="404"></A>the ships as though of their own free will. Nestor was first to hear the 
<A NAME="405"></A>tramp of their feet. "My friends," said he, "princes and counsellors of 
<A NAME="406"></A>the Argives, shall I guess right or wrong?- but I must say what I think: 
<A NAME="407"></A>there is a sound in my ears as of the tramp of horses. I hope it may Diomed 
<A NAME="408"></A>and Ulysses driving in horses from the Trojans, but I much fear that the 
<A NAME="409"></A>bravest of the Argives may have come to some harm at their 
<A NAME="410"></A>hands."
<A NAME="411"></A><BR><BR>He had hardly done speaking when the two men came in and dismounted, 
<A NAME="412"></A>whereon the others shook hands right gladly with them and congratulated 
<A NAME="413"></A>them. Nestor knight of Gerene was first to question them. "Tell me," said 
<A NAME="414"></A>he, "renowned Ulysses, how did you two come by these horses? Did you steal 
<A NAME="415"></A>in among the Trojan forces, or did some god meet you and give them to you? 
<A NAME="416"></A>They are like sunbeams. I am well conversant with the Trojans, for old 
<A NAME="417"></A>warrior though I am I never hold back by the ships, but I never yet saw 
<A NAME="418"></A>or heard of such horses as these are. Surely some god must have met you 
<A NAME="419"></A>and given them to you, for you are both of dear to Jove, and to Jove's 
<A NAME="420"></A>daughter Minerva."
<A NAME="421"></A><BR><BR>And Ulysses answered, "Nestor son of Neleus, honour to the Achaean 
<A NAME="422"></A>name, heaven, if it so will, can give us even better horses than these, 
<A NAME="423"></A>for the gods are far mightier than we are. These horses, however, about 
<A NAME="424"></A>which you ask me, are freshly come from Thrace. Diomed killed their king 
<A NAME="425"></A>with the twelve bravest of his companions. Hard by the ships we took a 
<A NAME="426"></A>thirteenth man- a scout whom Hector and the other Trojans had sent as a 
<A NAME="427"></A>spy upon our ships."
<A NAME="428"></A><BR><BR>He laughed as he spoke and drove the horses over the ditch, while 
<A NAME="429"></A>the other Achaeans followed him gladly. When they reached the strongly 
<A NAME="430"></A>built quarters of the son of Tydeus, they tied the horses with thongs of 
<A NAME="431"></A>leather to the manger, where the steeds of Diomed stood eating their sweet 
<A NAME="432"></A>corn, but Ulysses hung the blood-stained spoils of Dolon at the stern of 
<A NAME="433"></A>his ship, that they might prepare a sacred offering to Minerva. As for 
<A NAME="434"></A>themselves, they went into the sea and washed the sweat from their bodies, 
<A NAME="435"></A>and from their necks and thighs. When the sea-water had taken all the sweat 
<A NAME="436"></A>from off them, and had refreshed them, they went into the baths and washed 
<A NAME="437"></A>themselves. After they had so done and had anointed themselves with oil, 
<A NAME="438"></A>they sat down to table, and drawing from a full mixing-bowl, made a drink-offering 
<A NAME="439"></A>of wine to Minerva.
