<A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A>The assembly now broke up and the people went their ways each to his own 
<A NAME="11"></A>ship. There they made ready their supper, and then bethought them of the 
<A NAME="12"></A>blessed boon of sleep; but Achilles still wept for thinking of his dear 
<A NAME="13"></A>comrade, and sleep, before whom all things bow, could take no hold upon 
<A NAME="14"></A>him. This way and that did he turn as he yearned after the might and manfulness 
<A NAME="15"></A>of Patroclus; he thought of all they had done together, and all they had 
<A NAME="16"></A>gone through both on the field of battle and on the waves of the weary 
<A NAME="17"></A>sea. As he dwelt on these things he wept bitterly and lay now on his side, 
<A NAME="18"></A>now on his back, and now face downwards, till at last he rose and went 
<A NAME="19"></A>out as one distraught to wander upon the seashore. Then, when he saw dawn 
<A NAME="20"></A>breaking over beach and sea, he yoked his horses to his chariot, and bound 
<A NAME="21"></A>the body of Hector behind it that he might drag it about. Thrice did he 
<A NAME="22"></A>drag it round the tomb of the son of Menoetius, and then went back into 
<A NAME="23"></A>his tent, leaving the body on the ground full length and with its face 
<A NAME="24"></A>downwards. But Apollo would not suffer it to be disfigured, for he pitied 
<A NAME="25"></A>the man, dead though he now was; therefore he shielded him with his golden 
<A NAME="26"></A>aegis continually, that he might take no hurt while Achilles was dragging 
<A NAME="27"></A>him.
<A NAME="28"></A><BR><BR>Thus shamefully did Achilles in his fury dishonour Hector; but 
<A NAME="29"></A>the blessed gods looked down in pity from heaven, and urged Mercury, slayer 
<A NAME="30"></A>of Argus, to steal the body. All were of this mind save only Juno, Neptune, 
<A NAME="31"></A>and Jove's grey-eyed daughter, who persisted in the hate which they had 
<A NAME="32"></A>ever borne towards Ilius with Priam and his people; for they forgave not 
<A NAME="33"></A>the wrong done them by Alexandrus in disdaining the goddesses who came 
<A NAME="34"></A>to him when he was in his sheepyards, and preferring her who had offered 
<A NAME="35"></A>him a wanton to his ruin.
<A NAME="36"></A><BR><BR>When, therefore, the morning of the twelfth day had now come, Phoebus 
<A NAME="37"></A>Apollo spoke among the immortals saying, "You gods ought to be ashamed 
<A NAME="38"></A>of yourselves; you are cruel and hard-hearted. Did not Hector burn you 
<A NAME="39"></A>thigh-bones of heifers and of unblemished goats? And now dare you not rescue 
<A NAME="40"></A>even his dead body, for his wife to look upon, with his mother and child, 
<A NAME="41"></A>his father Priam, and his people, who would forthwith commit him to the 
<A NAME="42"></A>flames, and give him his due funeral rites? So, then, you would all be 
<A NAME="43"></A>on the side of mad Achilles, who knows neither right nor ruth? He is like 
<A NAME="44"></A>some savage lion that in the pride of his great strength and daring springs 
<A NAME="45"></A>upon men's flocks and gorges on them. Even so has Achilles flung aside 
<A NAME="46"></A>all pity, and all that conscience which at once so greatly banes yet greatly 
<A NAME="47"></A>boons him that will heed it. man may lose one far dearer than Achilles 
<A NAME="48"></A>has lost- a son, it may be, or a brother born from his own mother's womb; 
<A NAME="49"></A>yet when he has mourned him and wept over him he will let him bide, for 
<A NAME="50"></A>it takes much sorrow to kill a man; whereas Achilles, now that he has slain 
<A NAME="51"></A>noble Hector, drags him behind his chariot round the tomb of his comrade. 
<A NAME="52"></A>It were better of him, and for him, that he should not do so, for brave 
<A NAME="53"></A>though he be we gods may take it ill that he should vent his fury upon 
<A NAME="54"></A>dead clay."
<A NAME="55"></A><BR><BR>Juno spoke up in a rage. "This were well," she cried, "O lord of 
<A NAME="56"></A>the silver bow, if you would give like honour to Hector and to Achilles; 
<A NAME="57"></A>but Hector was mortal and suckled at a woman's breast, whereas Achilles 
<A NAME="58"></A>is the offspring of a goddess whom I myself reared and brought up. I married 
<A NAME="59"></A>her to Peleus, who is above measure dear to the immortals; you gods came 
<A NAME="60"></A>all of you to her wedding; you feasted along with them yourself and brought 
<A NAME="61"></A>your lyre- false, and fond of low company, that you have ever 
<A NAME="62"></A>been."
<A NAME="63"></A><BR><BR>Then said Jove, "Juno, be not so bitter. Their honour shall not 
<A NAME="64"></A>be equal, but of all that dwell in Ilius, Hector was dearest to the gods, 
<A NAME="65"></A>as also to myself, for his offerings never failed me. Never was my altar 
<A NAME="66"></A>stinted of its dues, nor of the drink-offerings and savour of sacrifice 
<A NAME="67"></A>which we claim of right. I shall therefore permit the body of mighty Hector 
<A NAME="68"></A>to be stolen; and yet this may hardly be without Achilles coming to know 
<A NAME="69"></A>it, for his mother keeps night and day beside him. Let some one of you, 
<A NAME="70"></A>therefore, send Thetis to me, and I will impart my counsel to her, namely 
<A NAME="71"></A>that Achilles is to accept a ransom from Priam, and give up the 
<A NAME="72"></A>body."
<A NAME="73"></A><BR><BR>On this Iris fleet as the wind went forth to carry his message. 
<A NAME="74"></A>Down she plunged into the dark sea midway between Samos and rocky Imbrus; 
<A NAME="75"></A>the waters hissed as they closed over her, and she sank into the bottom 
<A NAME="76"></A>as the lead at the end of an ox-horn, that is sped to carry death to fishes. 
<A NAME="77"></A>She found Thetis sitting in a great cave with the other sea-goddesses gathered 
<A NAME="78"></A>round her; there she sat in the midst of them weeping for her noble son 
<A NAME="79"></A>who was to fall far from his own land, on the rich plains of Troy. Iris 
<A NAME="80"></A>went up to her and said, "Rise Thetis; Jove, whose counsels fail not, bids 
<A NAME="81"></A>you come to him." And Thetis answered, "Why does the mighty god so bid 
<A NAME="82"></A>me? I am in great grief, and shrink from going in and out among the immortals. 
<A NAME="83"></A>Still, I will go, and the word that he may speak shall not be spoken in 
<A NAME="84"></A>vain."
<A NAME="85"></A><BR><BR>The goddess took her dark veil, than which there can be no robe 
<A NAME="86"></A>more sombre, and went forth with fleet Iris leading the way before her. 
<A NAME="87"></A>The waves of the sea opened them a path, and when they reached the shore 
<A NAME="88"></A>they flew up into the heavens, where they found the all-seeing son of Saturn 
<A NAME="89"></A>with the blessed gods that live for ever assembled near him. Minerva gave 
<A NAME="90"></A>up her seat to her, and she sat down by the side of father Jove. Juno then 
<A NAME="91"></A>placed a fair golden cup in her hand, and spoke to her in words of comfort, 
<A NAME="92"></A>whereon Thetis drank and gave her back the cup; and the sire of gods and 
<A NAME="93"></A>men was the first to speak.
<A NAME="94"></A><BR><BR>"So, goddess," said he, "for all your sorrow, and the grief that 
<A NAME="95"></A>I well know reigns ever in your heart, you have come hither to Olympus, 
<A NAME="96"></A>and I will tell you why I have sent for you. This nine days past the immortals 
<A NAME="97"></A>have been quarrelling about Achilles waster of cities and the body of Hector. 
<A NAME="98"></A>The gods would have Mercury slayer of Argus steal the body, but in furtherance 
<A NAME="99"></A>of our peace and amity henceforward, I will concede such honour to your 
<A NAME="100"></A>son as I will now tell you. Go, then, to the host and lay these commands 
<A NAME="101"></A>upon him; say that the gods are angry with him, and that I am myself more 
<A NAME="102"></A>angry than them all, in that he keeps Hector at the ships and will not 
<A NAME="103"></A>give him up. He may thus fear me and let the body go. At the same time 
<A NAME="104"></A>I will send Iris to great Priam to bid him go to the ships of the Achaeans, 
<A NAME="105"></A>and ransom his son, taking with him such gifts for Achilles as may give 
<A NAME="106"></A>him satisfaction.
<A NAME="107"></A><BR><BR>Silver-footed Thetis did as the god had told her, and forthwith 
<A NAME="108"></A>down she darted from the topmost summits of Olympus. She went to her son's 
<A NAME="109"></A>tents where she found him grieving bitterly, while his trusty comrades 
<A NAME="110"></A>round him were busy preparing their morning meal, for which they had killed 
<A NAME="111"></A>a great woolly sheep. His mother sat down beside him and caressed him with 
<A NAME="112"></A>her hand saying, "My son, how long will you keep on thus grieving and making 
<A NAME="113"></A>moan? You are gnawing at your own heart, and think neither of food nor 
<A NAME="114"></A>of woman's embraces; and yet these too were well, for you have no long 
<A NAME="115"></A>time to live, and death with the strong hand of fate are already close 
<A NAME="116"></A>beside you. Now, therefore, heed what I say, for I come as a messenger 
<A NAME="117"></A>from Jove; he says that the gods are angry with you, and himself more angry 
<A NAME="118"></A>than them all, in that you keep Hector at the ships and will not give him 
<A NAME="119"></A>up. Therefore let him go, and accept a ransom for his 
<A NAME="120"></A>body."
<A NAME="121"></A><BR><BR>And Achilles answered, "So be it. If Olympian Jove of his own motion 
<A NAME="122"></A>thus commands me, let him that brings the ransom bear the body 
<A NAME="123"></A>away."
<A NAME="124"></A><BR><BR>Thus did mother and son talk together at the ships in long discourse 
<A NAME="125"></A>with one another. Meanwhile the son of Saturn sent Iris to the strong city 
<A NAME="126"></A>of Ilius. "Go," said he, "fleet Iris, from the mansions of Olympus, and 
<A NAME="127"></A>tell King Priam in Ilius, that he is to go to the ships of the Achaeans 
<A NAME="128"></A>and free the body of his dear son. He is to take such gifts with him as 
<A NAME="129"></A>shall give satisfaction to Achilles, and he is to go alone, with no other 
<A NAME="130"></A>Trojan, save only some honoured servant who may drive his mules and waggon, 
<A NAME="131"></A>and bring back the body of him whom noble Achilles has slain. Let him have 
<A NAME="132"></A>no thought nor fear of death in his heart, for we will send the slayer 
<A NAME="133"></A>of Argus to escort him, and bring him within the tent of Achilles. Achilles 
<A NAME="134"></A>will not kill him nor let another do so, for he will take heed to his ways 
<A NAME="135"></A>and sin not, and he will entreat a suppliant with all honourable 
<A NAME="136"></A>courtesy."
<A NAME="137"></A><BR><BR>On this Iris, fleet as the wind, sped forth to deliver her message. 
<A NAME="138"></A>She went to Priam's house, and found weeping and lamentation therein. His 
<A NAME="139"></A>sons were seated round their father in the outer courtyard, and their raiment 
<A NAME="140"></A>was wet with tears: the old man sat in the midst of them with his mantle 
<A NAME="141"></A>wrapped close about his body, and his head and neck all covered with the 
<A NAME="142"></A>filth which he had clutched as he lay grovelling in the mire. His daughters 
<A NAME="143"></A>and his sons' wives went wailing about the house, as they thought of the 
<A NAME="144"></A>many and brave men who lay dead, slain by the Argives. The messenger of 
<A NAME="145"></A>Jove stood by Priam and spoke softly to him, but fear fell upon him as 
<A NAME="146"></A>she did so. "Take heart," she said, "Priam offspring of Dardanus, take 
<A NAME="147"></A>heart and fear not. I bring no evil tidings, but am minded well towards 
<A NAME="148"></A>you. I come as a messenger from Jove, who though he be not near, takes 
<A NAME="149"></A>thought for you and pities you. The lord of Olympus bids you go and ransom 
<A NAME="150"></A>noble Hector, and take with you such gifts as shall give satisfaction to 
<A NAME="151"></A>Achilles. You are to go alone, with no Trojan, save only some honoured 
<A NAME="152"></A>servant who may drive your mules and waggon, and bring back to the city 
<A NAME="153"></A>the body of him whom noble Achilles has slain. You are to have no thought, 
<A NAME="154"></A>nor fear of death, for Jove will send the slayer of Argus to escort you. 
<A NAME="155"></A>When he has brought you within Achilles' tent, Achilles will not kill you 
<A NAME="156"></A>nor let another do so, for he will take heed to his ways and sin not, and 
<A NAME="157"></A>he will entreat a suppliant with all honourable courtesy."
<A NAME="158"></A><BR><BR>Iris went her way when she had thus spoken, and Priam told his 
<A NAME="159"></A>sons to get a mule-waggon ready, and to make the body of the waggon fast 
<A NAME="160"></A>upon the top of its bed. Then he went down into his fragrant store-room, 
<A NAME="161"></A>high-vaulted, and made of cedar-wood, where his many treasures were kept, 
<A NAME="162"></A>and he called Hecuba his wife. "Wife," said he, "a messenger has come to 
<A NAME="163"></A>me from Olympus, and has told me to go to the ships of the Achaeans to 
<A NAME="164"></A>ransom my dear son, taking with me such gifts as shall give satisfaction 
<A NAME="165"></A>to Achilles. What think you of this matter? for my own part I am greatly 
<A NAME="166"></A>moved to pass through the of the Achaeans and go to their 
<A NAME="167"></A>ships."
<A NAME="168"></A><BR><BR>His wife cried aloud as she heard him, and said, "Alas, what has 
<A NAME="169"></A>become of that judgement for which you have been ever famous both among 
<A NAME="170"></A>strangers and your own people? How can you venture alone to the ships of 
<A NAME="171"></A>the Achaeans, and look into the face of him who has slain so many of your 
<A NAME="172"></A>brave sons? You must have iron courage, for if the cruel savage sees you 
<A NAME="173"></A>and lays hold on you, he will know neither respect nor pity. Let us then 
<A NAME="174"></A>weep Hector from afar here in our own house, for when I gave him birth 
<A NAME="175"></A>the threads of overruling fate were spun for him that dogs should eat his 
<A NAME="176"></A>flesh far from his parents, in the house of that terrible man on whose 
<A NAME="177"></A>liver I would fain fasten and devour it. Thus would I avenge my son, who 
<A NAME="178"></A>showed no cowardice when Achilles slew him, and thought neither of Right 
<A NAME="179"></A>nor of avoiding battle as he stood in defence of Trojan men and Trojan 
<A NAME="180"></A>women."
<A NAME="181"></A><BR><BR>Then Priam said, "I would go, do not therefore stay me nor be as 
<A NAME="182"></A>a bird of ill omen in my house, for you will not move me. Had it been some 
<A NAME="183"></A>mortal man who had sent me some prophet or priest who divines from sacrifice- 
<A NAME="184"></A>I should have deemed him false and have given him no heed; but now I have 
<A NAME="185"></A>heard the goddess and seen her face to face, therefore I will go and her 
<A NAME="186"></A>saying shall not be in vain. If it be my fate to die at the ships of the 
<A NAME="187"></A>Achaeans even so would I have it; let Achilles slay me, if I may but first 
<A NAME="188"></A>have taken my son in my arms and mourned him to my heart's 
<A NAME="189"></A>comforting."
<A NAME="190"></A><BR><BR>So saying he lifted the lids of his chests, and took out twelve 
<A NAME="191"></A>goodly vestments. He took also twelve cloaks of single fold, twelve rugs, 
<A NAME="192"></A>twelve fair mantles, and an equal number of shirts. He weighed out ten 
<A NAME="193"></A>talents of gold, and brought moreover two burnished tripods, four cauldrons, 
<A NAME="194"></A>and a very beautiful cup which the Thracians had given him when he had 
<A NAME="195"></A>gone to them on an embassy; it was very precious, but he grudged not even 
<A NAME="196"></A>this, so eager was he to ransom the body of his son. Then he chased all 
<A NAME="197"></A>the Trojans from the court and rebuked them with words of anger. "Out," 
<A NAME="198"></A>he cried, "shame and disgrace to me that you are. Have you no grief in 
<A NAME="199"></A>your own homes that you are come to plague me here? Is it a small thing, 
<A NAME="200"></A>think you, that the son of Saturn has sent this sorrow upon me, to lose 
<A NAME="201"></A>the bravest of my sons? Nay, you shall prove it in person, for now he is 
<A NAME="202"></A>gone the Achaeans will have easier work in killing you. As for me, let 
<A NAME="203"></A>me go down within the house of Hades, ere mine eyes behold the sacking 
<A NAME="204"></A>and wasting of the city."
<A NAME="205"></A><BR><BR>He drove the men away with his staff, and they went forth as the 
<A NAME="206"></A>old man sped them. Then he called to his sons, upbraiding Helenus, Paris, 
<A NAME="207"></A>noble Agathon, Pammon, Antiphonus, Polites of the loud battle-cry, Deiphobus, 
<A NAME="208"></A>Hippothous, and Dius. These nine did the old man call near him. "Come to 
<A NAME="209"></A>me at once," he cried, "worthless sons who do me shame; would that you 
<A NAME="210"></A>had all been killed at the ships rather than Hector. Miserable man that 
<A NAME="211"></A>I am, I have had the bravest sons in all Troy- noble Nestor, Troilus the 
<A NAME="212"></A>dauntless charioteer, and Hector who was a god among men, so that one would 
<A NAME="213"></A>have thought he was son to an immortal- yet there is not one of them left. 
<A NAME="214"></A>Mars has slain them and those of whom I am ashamed are alone left me. Liars, 
<A NAME="215"></A>and light of foot, heroes of the dance, robbers of lambs and kids from 
<A NAME="216"></A>your own people, why do you not get a waggon ready for me at once, and 
<A NAME="217"></A>put all these things upon it that I may set out on my 
<A NAME="218"></A>way?"
<A NAME="219"></A><BR><BR>Thus did he speak, and they feared the rebuke of their father. 
<A NAME="220"></A>They brought out a strong mule-waggon, newly made, and set the body of 
<A NAME="221"></A>the waggon fast on its bed. They took the mule-yoke from the peg on which 
<A NAME="222"></A>it hung, a yoke of boxwood with a knob on the top of it and rings for the 
<A NAME="223"></A>reins to go through. Then they brought a yoke-band eleven cubits long, 
<A NAME="224"></A>to bind the yoke to the pole; they bound it on at the far end of the pole, 
<A NAME="225"></A>and put the ring over the upright pin making it fast with three turns of 
<A NAME="226"></A>the band on either side the knob, and bending the thong of the yoke beneath 
<A NAME="227"></A>it. This done, they brought from the store-chamber the rich ransom that 
<A NAME="228"></A>was to purchase the body of Hector, and they set it all orderly on the 
<A NAME="229"></A>waggon; then they yoked the strong harness-mules which the Mysians had 
<A NAME="230"></A>on a time given as a goodly present to Priam; but for Priam himself they 
<A NAME="231"></A>yoked horses which the old king had bred, and kept for own 
<A NAME="232"></A>use.
<A NAME="233"></A><BR><BR>Thus heedfully did Priam and his servant see to the yolking of 
<A NAME="234"></A>their cars at the palace. Then Hecuba came to them all sorrowful, with 
<A NAME="235"></A>a golden goblet of wine in her right hand, that they might make a drink-offering 
<A NAME="236"></A>before they set out. She stood in front of the horses and said, "Take this, 
<A NAME="237"></A>make a drink-offering to father Jove, and since you are minded to go to 
<A NAME="238"></A>the ships in spite of me, pray that you may come safely back from the hands 
<A NAME="239"></A>of your enemies. Pray to the son of Saturn lord of the whirlwind, who sits 
<A NAME="240"></A>on Ida and looks down over all Troy, pray him to send his swift messenger 
<A NAME="241"></A>on your right hand, the bird of omen which is strongest and most dear to 
<A NAME="242"></A>him of all birds, that you may see it with your own eyes and trust it as 
<A NAME="243"></A>you go forth to the ships of the Danaans. If all-seeing Jove will not send 
<A NAME="244"></A>you this messenger, however set upon it you may be, I would not have you 
<A NAME="245"></A>go to the ships of the Argives."
<A NAME="246"></A><BR><BR>And Priam answered, "Wife, I will do as you desire me; it is well 
<A NAME="247"></A>to lift hands in prayer to Jove, if so be he may have mercy upon 
<A NAME="248"></A>me."
<A NAME="249"></A><BR><BR>With this the old man bade the serving-woman pour pure water over 
<A NAME="250"></A>his hands, and the woman came, bearing the water in a bowl. He washed his 
<A NAME="251"></A>hands and took the cup from his wife; then he made the drink-offering and 
<A NAME="252"></A>prayed, standing in the middle of the courtyard and turning his eyes to 
<A NAME="253"></A>heaven. "Father Jove," he said, "that rulest from Ida, most glorious and 
<A NAME="254"></A>most great, grant that I may be received kindly and compassionately in 
<A NAME="255"></A>the tents of Achilles; and send your swift messenger upon my right hand, 
<A NAME="256"></A>the bird of omen which is strongest and most dear to you of all birds, 
<A NAME="257"></A>that I may see it with my own eyes and trust it as I go forth to the ships 
<A NAME="258"></A>of the Danaans."
<A NAME="259"></A><BR><BR>So did he pray, and Jove the lord of counsel heard his prayer. 
<A NAME="260"></A>Forthwith he sent an eagle, the most unerring portent of all birds that 
<A NAME="261"></A>fly, the dusky hunter that men also call the Black Eagle. His wings were 
<A NAME="262"></A>spread abroad on either side as wide as the well-made and well-bolted door 
<A NAME="263"></A>of a rich man's chamber. He came to them flying over the city upon their 
<A NAME="264"></A>right hands, and when they saw him they were glad and their hearts took 
<A NAME="265"></A>comfort within them. The old man made haste to mount his chariot, and drove 
<A NAME="266"></A>out through the inner gateway and under the echoing gatehouse of the outer 
<A NAME="267"></A>court. Before him went the mules drawing the four-wheeled waggon, and driven 
<A NAME="268"></A>by wise Idaeus; behind these were the horses, which the old man lashed 
<A NAME="269"></A>with his whip and drove swiftly through the city, while his friends followed 
<A NAME="270"></A>after, wailing and lamenting for him as though he were on his road to death. 
<A NAME="271"></A>As soon as they had come down from the city and had reached the plain, 
<A NAME="272"></A>his sons and sons-in-law who had followed him went back to 
<A NAME="273"></A>Ilius.
<A NAME="274"></A><BR><BR>But Priam and Idaeus as they showed out upon the plain did not 
<A NAME="275"></A>escape the ken of all-seeing Jove, who looked down upon the old man and 
<A NAME="276"></A>pitied him; then he spoke to his son Mercury and said, "Mercury, for it 
<A NAME="277"></A>is you who are the most disposed to escort men on their way, and to hear 
<A NAME="278"></A>those whom you will hear, go, and so conduct Priam to the ships of the 
<A NAME="279"></A>Achaeans that no other of the Danaans shall see him nor take note of him 
<A NAME="280"></A>until he reach the son of Peleus."
<A NAME="281"></A><BR><BR>Thus he spoke and Mercury, guide and guardian, slayer of Argus, 
<A NAME="282"></A>did as he was told. Forthwith he bound on his glittering golden sandals 
<A NAME="283"></A>with which he could fly like the wind over land and sea; he took the wand 
<A NAME="284"></A>with which he seals men's eyes in sleep, or wakes them just as he pleases, 
<A NAME="285"></A>and flew holding it in his hand till he came to Troy and to the Hellespont. 
<A NAME="286"></A>To look at, he was like a young man of noble birth in the hey-day of his 
<A NAME="287"></A>youth and beauty with the down just coming upon his 
<A NAME="288"></A>face.
<A NAME="289"></A><BR><BR>Now when Priam and Idaeus had driven past the great tomb of Ilius, 
<A NAME="290"></A>they stayed their mules and horses that they might drink in the river, 
<A NAME="291"></A>for the shades of night were falling, when, therefore, Idaeus saw Mercury 
<A NAME="292"></A>standing near them he said to Priam, "Take heed, descendant of Dardanus; 
<A NAME="293"></A>here is matter which demands consideration. I see a man who I think will 
<A NAME="294"></A>presently fall upon us; let us fly with our horses, or at least embrace 
<A NAME="295"></A>his knees and implore him to take compassion upon us?
<A NAME="296"></A><BR><BR>When he heard this the old man's heart failed him, and he was in 
<A NAME="297"></A>great fear; he stayed where he was as one dazed, and the hair stood on 
<A NAME="298"></A>end over his whole body; but the bringer of good luck came up to him and 
<A NAME="299"></A>took him by the hand, saying, "Whither, father, are you thus driving your 
<A NAME="300"></A>mules and horses in the dead of night when other men are asleep? Are you 
<A NAME="301"></A>not afraid of the fierce Achaeans who are hard by you, so cruel and relentless? 
<A NAME="302"></A>Should some one of them see you bearing so much treasure through the darkness 
<A NAME="303"></A>of the flying night, what would not your state then be? You are no longer 
<A NAME="304"></A>young, and he who is with you is too old to protect you from those who 
<A NAME="305"></A>would attack you. For myself, I will do you no harm, and I will defend 
<A NAME="306"></A>you from any one else, for you remind me of my own father."
<A NAME="307"></A><BR><BR>And Priam answered, "It is indeed as you say, my dear son; nevertheless 
<A NAME="308"></A>some god has held his hand over me, in that he has sent such a wayfarer 
<A NAME="309"></A>as yourself to meet me so Opportunely; you are so comely in mien and figure, 
<A NAME="310"></A>and your judgement is so excellent that you must come of blessed 
<A NAME="311"></A>parents."
<A NAME="312"></A><BR><BR>Then said the slayer of Argus, guide and guardian, "Sir, all that 
<A NAME="313"></A>you have said is right; but tell me and tell me true, are you taking this 
<A NAME="314"></A>rich treasure to send it to a foreign people where it may be safe, or are 
<A NAME="315"></A>you all leaving strong Ilius in dismay now that your son has fallen who 
<A NAME="316"></A>was the bravest man among you and was never lacking in battle with the 
<A NAME="317"></A>Achaeans?"
<A NAME="318"></A><BR><BR>And Priam said, "Wo are you, my friend, and who are your parents, 
<A NAME="319"></A>that you speak so truly about the fate of my unhappy 
<A NAME="320"></A>son?"
<A NAME="321"></A><BR><BR>The slayer of Argus, guide and guardian, answered him, "Sir, you 
<A NAME="322"></A>would prove me, that you question me about noble Hector. Many a time have 
<A NAME="323"></A>I set eyes upon him in battle when he was driving the Argives to their 
<A NAME="324"></A>ships and putting them to the sword. We stood still and marvelled, for 
<A NAME="325"></A>Achilles in his anger with the son of Atreus suffered us not to fight. 
<A NAME="326"></A>I am his squire, and came with him in the same ship. I am a Myrmidon, and 
<A NAME="327"></A>my father's name is Polyctor: he is a rich man and about as old as you 
<A NAME="328"></A>are; he has six sons besides myself, and I am the seventh. We cast lots, 
<A NAME="329"></A>and it fell upon me to sail hither with Achilles. I am now come from the 
<A NAME="330"></A>ships on to the plain, for with daybreak the Achaeans will set battle in 
<A NAME="331"></A>array about the city. They chafe at doing nothing, and are so eager that 
<A NAME="332"></A>their princes cannot hold them back."
<A NAME="333"></A><BR><BR>Then answered Priam, "If you are indeed the squire of Achilles 
<A NAME="334"></A>son of Peleus, tell me now the Whole truth. Is my son still at the ships, 
<A NAME="335"></A>or has Achilles hewn him limb from limb, and given him to his 
<A NAME="336"></A>hounds?"
<A NAME="337"></A><BR><BR>"Sir," replied the slayer of Argus, guide and guardian, "neither 
<A NAME="338"></A>hounds nor vultures have yet devoured him; he is still just lying at the 
<A NAME="339"></A>tents by the ship of Achilles, and though it is now twelve days that he 
<A NAME="340"></A>has lain there, his flesh is not wasted nor have the worms eaten him although 
<A NAME="341"></A>they feed on warriors. At daybreak Achilles drags him cruelly round the 
<A NAME="342"></A>sepulchre of his dear comrade, but it does him no hurt. You should come 
<A NAME="343"></A>yourself and see how he lies fresh as dew, with the blood all washed away, 
<A NAME="344"></A>and his wounds every one of them closed though many pierced him with their 
<A NAME="345"></A>spears. Such care have the blessed gods taken of your brave son, for he 
<A NAME="346"></A>was dear to them beyond all measure."
<A NAME="347"></A><BR><BR>The old man was comforted as he heard him and said, "My son, see 
<A NAME="348"></A>what a good thing it is to have made due offerings to the immortals; for 
<A NAME="349"></A>as sure as that he was born my son never forgot the gods that hold Olympus, 
<A NAME="350"></A>and now they requite it to him even in death. Accept therefore at my hands 
<A NAME="351"></A>this goodly chalice; guard me and with heaven's help guide me till I come 
<A NAME="352"></A>to the tent of the son of Peleus."
<A NAME="353"></A><BR><BR>Then answered the slayer of Argus, guide and guardian, "Sir, you 
<A NAME="354"></A>are tempting me and playing upon my youth, but you shall not move me, for 
<A NAME="355"></A>you are offering me presents without the knowledge of Achilles whom I fear 
<A NAME="356"></A>and hold it great guiltless to defraud, lest some evil presently befall 
<A NAME="357"></A>me; but as your guide I would go with you even to Argos itself, and would 
<A NAME="358"></A>guard you so carefully whether by sea or land, that no one should attack 
<A NAME="359"></A>you through making light of him who was with you."
<A NAME="360"></A><BR><BR>The bringer of good luck then sprang on to the chariot, and seizing 
<A NAME="361"></A>the whip and reins he breathed fresh spirit into the mules and horses. 
<A NAME="362"></A>When they reached the trench and the wall that was before the ships, those 
<A NAME="363"></A>who were on guard had just been getting their suppers, and the slayer of 
<A NAME="364"></A>Argus threw them all into a deep sleep. Then he drew back the bolts to 
<A NAME="365"></A>open the gates, and took Priam inside with the treasure he had upon his 
<A NAME="366"></A>waggon. Ere long they came to the lofty dwelling of the son of Peleus for 
<A NAME="367"></A>which the Myrmidons had cut pine and which they had built for their king; 
<A NAME="368"></A>when they had built it they thatched it with coarse tussock-grass which 
<A NAME="369"></A>they had mown out on the plain, and all round it they made a large courtyard, 
<A NAME="370"></A>which was fenced with stakes set close together. The gate was barred with 
<A NAME="371"></A>a single bolt of pine which it took three men to force into its place, 
<A NAME="372"></A>and three to draw back so as to open the gate, but Achilles could draw 
<A NAME="373"></A>it by himself. Mercury opened the gate for the old man, and brought in 
<A NAME="374"></A>the treasure that he was taking with him for the son of Peleus. Then he 
<A NAME="375"></A>sprang from the chariot on to the ground and said, "Sir, it is I, immortal 
<A NAME="376"></A>Mercury, that am come with you, for my father sent me to escort you. I 
<A NAME="377"></A>will now leave you, and will not enter into the presence of Achilles, for 
<A NAME="378"></A>it might anger him that a god should befriend mortal men thus openly. Go 
<A NAME="379"></A>you within, and embrace the knees of the son of Peleus: beseech him by 
<A NAME="380"></A>his father, his lovely mother, and his son; thus you may move 
<A NAME="381"></A>him."
<A NAME="382"></A><BR><BR>With these words Mercury went back to high Olympus. Priam sprang 
<A NAME="383"></A>from his chariot to the ground, leaving Idaeus where he was, in charge 
<A NAME="384"></A>of the mules and horses. The old man went straight into the house where 
<A NAME="385"></A>Achilles, loved of the gods, was sitting. There he found him with his men 
<A NAME="386"></A>seated at a distance from him: only two, the hero Automedon, and Alcimus 
<A NAME="387"></A>of the race of Mars, were busy in attendance about his person, for he had 
<A NAME="388"></A>but just done eating and drinking, and the table was still there. King 
<A NAME="389"></A>Priam entered without their seeing him, and going right up to Achilles 
<A NAME="390"></A>he clasped his knees and kissed the dread murderous hands that had slain 
<A NAME="391"></A>so many of his sons.
<A NAME="392"></A><BR><BR>As when some cruel spite has befallen a man that he should have 
<A NAME="393"></A>killed some one in his own country, and must fly to a great man's protection 
<A NAME="394"></A>in a land of strangers, and all marvel who see him, even so did Achilles 
<A NAME="395"></A>marvel as he beheld Priam. The others looked one to another and marvelled 
<A NAME="396"></A>also, but Priam besought Achilles saying, "Think of your father, O Achilles 
<A NAME="397"></A>like unto the gods, who is such even as I am, on the sad threshold of old 
<A NAME="398"></A>age. It may be that those who dwell near him harass him, and there is none 
<A NAME="399"></A>to keep war and ruin from him. Yet when he hears of you being still alive, 
<A NAME="400"></A>he is glad, and his days are full of hope that he shall see his dear son 
<A NAME="401"></A>come home to him from Troy; but I, wretched man that I am, had the bravest 
<A NAME="402"></A>in all Troy for my sons, and there is not one of them left. I had fifty 
<A NAME="403"></A>sons when the Achaeans came here; nineteen of them were from a single womb, 
<A NAME="404"></A>and the others were borne to me by the women of my household. The greater 
<A NAME="405"></A>part of them has fierce Mars laid low, and Hector, him who was alone left, 
<A NAME="406"></A>him who was the guardian of the city and ourselves, him have you lately 
<A NAME="407"></A>slain; therefore I am now come to the ships of the Achaeans to ransom his 
<A NAME="408"></A>body from you with a great ransom. Fear, O Achilles, the wrath of heaven; 
<A NAME="409"></A>think on your own father and have compassion upon me, who am the more pitiable, 
<A NAME="410"></A>for I have steeled myself as no man yet has ever steeled himself before 
<A NAME="411"></A>me, and have raised to my lips the hand of him who slew my 
<A NAME="412"></A>son."
<A NAME="413"></A><BR><BR>Thus spoke Priam, and the heart of Achilles yearned as he bethought 
<A NAME="414"></A>him of his father. He took the old man's hand and moved him gently away. 
<A NAME="415"></A>The two wept bitterly- Priam, as he lay at Achilles' feet, weeping for 
<A NAME="416"></A>Hector, and Achilles now for his father and now for Patroclous, till the 
<A NAME="417"></A>house was filled with their lamentation. But when Achilles was now sated 
<A NAME="418"></A>with grief and had unburthened the bitterness of his sorrow, he left his 
<A NAME="419"></A>seat and raised the old man by the hand, in pity for his white hair and 
<A NAME="420"></A>beard; then he said, "Unhappy man, you have indeed been greatly daring; 
<A NAME="421"></A>how could you venture to come alone to the ships of the Achaeans, and enter 
<A NAME="422"></A>the presence of him who has slain so many of your brave sons? You must 
<A NAME="423"></A>have iron courage: sit now upon this seat, and for all our grief we will 
<A NAME="424"></A>hide our sorrows in our hearts, for weeping will not avail us. The immortals 
<A NAME="425"></A>know no care, yet the lot they spin for man is full of sorrow; on the floor 
<A NAME="426"></A>of Jove's palace there stand two urns, the one filled with evil gifts, 
<A NAME="427"></A>and the other with good ones. He for whom Jove the lord of thunder mixes 
<A NAME="428"></A>the gifts he sends, will meet now with good and now with evil fortune; 
<A NAME="429"></A>but he to whom Jove sends none but evil gifts will be pointed at by the 
<A NAME="430"></A>finger of scorn, the hand of famine will pursue him to the ends of the 
<A NAME="431"></A>world, and he will go up and down the face of the earth, respected neither 
<A NAME="432"></A>by gods nor men. Even so did it befall Peleus; the gods endowed him with 
<A NAME="433"></A>all good things from his birth upwards, for he reigned over the Myrmidons 
<A NAME="434"></A>excelling all men in prosperity and wealth, and mortal though he was they 
<A NAME="435"></A>gave him a goddess for his bride. But even on him too did heaven send misfortune, 
<A NAME="436"></A>for there is no race of royal children born to him in his house, save one 
<A NAME="437"></A>son who is doomed to die all untimely; nor may I take care of him now that 
<A NAME="438"></A>he is growing old, for I must stay here at Troy to be the bane of you and 
<A NAME="439"></A>your children. And you too, O Priam, I have heard that you were aforetime 
<A NAME="440"></A>happy. They say that in wealth and plenitude of offspring you surpassed 
<A NAME="441"></A>all that is in Lesbos, the realm of Makar to the northward, Phrygia that 
<A NAME="442"></A>is more inland, and those that dwell upon the great Hellespont; but from 
<A NAME="443"></A>the day when the dwellers in heaven sent this evil upon you, war and slaughter 
<A NAME="444"></A>have been about your city continually. Bear up against it, and let there 
<A NAME="445"></A>be some intervals in your sorrow. Mourn as you may for your brave son, 
<A NAME="446"></A>you will take nothing by it. You cannot raise him from the dead, ere you 
<A NAME="447"></A>do so yet another sorrow shall befall you."
<A NAME="448"></A><BR><BR>And Priam answered, "O king, bid me not be seated, while Hector 
<A NAME="449"></A>is still lying uncared for in your tents, but accept the great ransom which 
<A NAME="450"></A>I have brought you, and give him to me at once that I may look upon him. 
<A NAME="451"></A>May you prosper with the ransom and reach your own land in safety, seeing 
<A NAME="452"></A>that you have suffered me to live and to look upon the light of the 
<A NAME="453"></A>sun."
<A NAME="454"></A><BR><BR>Achilles looked at him sternly and said, "Vex me, sir, no longer; 
<A NAME="455"></A>I am of myself minded to give up the body of Hector. My mother, daughter 
<A NAME="456"></A>of the old man of the sea, came to me from Jove to bid me deliver it to 
<A NAME="457"></A>you. Moreover I know well, O Priam, and you cannot hide it, that some god 
<A NAME="458"></A>has brought you to the ships of the Achaeans, for else, no man however 
<A NAME="459"></A>strong and in his prime would dare to come to our host; he could neither 
<A NAME="460"></A>pass our guard unseen, nor draw the bolt of my gates thus easily; therefore, 
<A NAME="461"></A>provoke me no further, lest I sin against the word of Jove, and suffer 
<A NAME="462"></A>you not, suppliant though you are, within my tents."
<A NAME="463"></A><BR><BR>The old man feared him and obeyed. Then the son of Peleus sprang 
<A NAME="464"></A>like a lion through the door of his house, not alone, but with him went 
<A NAME="465"></A>his two squires Automedon and Alcimus who were closer to him than any others 
<A NAME="466"></A>of his comrades now that Patroclus was no more. These unyoked the horses 
<A NAME="467"></A>and mules, and bade Priam's herald and attendant be seated within the house. 
<A NAME="468"></A>They lifted the ransom for Hector's body from the waggon. but they left 
<A NAME="469"></A>two mantles and a goodly shirt, that Achilles might wrap the body in them 
<A NAME="470"></A>when he gave it to be taken home. Then he called to his servants and ordered 
<A NAME="471"></A>them to wash the body and anoint it, but he first took it to a place where 
<A NAME="472"></A>Priam should not see it, lest if he did so, he should break out in the 
<A NAME="473"></A>bitterness of his grief, and enrage Achilles, who might then kill him and 
<A NAME="474"></A>sin against the word of Jove. When the servants had washed the body and 
<A NAME="475"></A>anointed it, and had wrapped it in a fair shirt and mantle, Achilles himself 
<A NAME="476"></A>lifted it on to a bier, and he and his men then laid it on the waggon. 
<A NAME="477"></A>He cried aloud as he did so and called on the name of his dear comrade, 
<A NAME="478"></A>"Be not angry with me, Patroclus," he said, "if you hear even in the house 
<A NAME="479"></A>of Hades that I have given Hector to his father for a ransom. It has been 
<A NAME="480"></A>no unworthy one, and I will share it equitably with 
<A NAME="481"></A>you."
<A NAME="482"></A><BR><BR>Achilles then went back into the tent and took his place on the 
<A NAME="483"></A>richly inlaid seat from which he had risen, by the wall that was at right 
<A NAME="484"></A>angles to the one against which Priam was sitting. "Sir," he said, "your 
<A NAME="485"></A>son is now laid upon his bier and is ransomed according to desire; you 
<A NAME="486"></A>shall look upon him when you him away at daybreak; for the present let 
<A NAME="487"></A>us prepare our supper. Even lovely Niobe had to think about eating, though 
<A NAME="488"></A>her twelve children- six daughters and six lusty sons- had been all slain 
<A NAME="489"></A>in her house. Apollo killed the sons with arrows from his silver bow, to 
<A NAME="490"></A>punish Niobe, and Diana slew the daughters, because Niobe had vaunted herself 
<A NAME="491"></A>against Leto; she said Leto had borne two children only, whereas she had 
<A NAME="492"></A>herself borne many- whereon the two killed the many. Nine days did they 
<A NAME="493"></A>lie weltering, and there was none to bury them, for the son of Saturn turned 
<A NAME="494"></A>the people into stone; but on the tenth day the gods in heaven themselves 
<A NAME="495"></A>buried them, and Niobe then took food, being worn out with weeping. They 
<A NAME="496"></A>say that somewhere among the rocks on the mountain pastures of Sipylus, 
<A NAME="497"></A>where the nymphs live that haunt the river Achelous, there, they say, she 
<A NAME="498"></A>lives in stone and still nurses the sorrows sent upon her by the hand of 
<A NAME="499"></A>heaven. Therefore, noble sir, let us two now take food; you can weep for 
<A NAME="500"></A>your dear son hereafter as you are bearing him back to Ilius- and many 
<A NAME="501"></A>a tear will he cost you."
<A NAME="502"></A><BR><BR>With this Achilles sprang from his seat and killed a sheep of silvery 
<A NAME="503"></A>whiteness, which his followers skinned and made ready all in due order. 
<A NAME="504"></A>They cut the meat carefully up into smaller pieces, spitted them, and drew 
<A NAME="505"></A>them off again when they were well roasted. Automedon brought bread in 
<A NAME="506"></A>fair baskets and served it round the table, while Achilles dealt out the 
<A NAME="507"></A>meat, and they laid their hands on the good things that were before them. 
<A NAME="508"></A>As soon as they had had enough to eat and drink, Priam, descendant of Dardanus, 
<A NAME="509"></A>marvelled at the strength and beauty of Achilles for he was as a god to 
<A NAME="510"></A>see, and Achilles marvelled at Priam as he listened to him and looked upon 
<A NAME="511"></A>his noble presence. When they had gazed their fill Priam spoke first. "And 
<A NAME="512"></A>now, O king," he said, "take me to my couch that we may lie down and enjoy 
<A NAME="513"></A>the blessed boon of sleep. Never once have my eyes been closed from the 
<A NAME="514"></A>day your hands took the life of my son; I have grovelled without ceasing 
<A NAME="515"></A>in the mire of my stable-yard, making moan and brooding over my countless 
<A NAME="516"></A>sorrows. Now, moreover, I have eaten bread and drunk wine; hitherto I have 
<A NAME="517"></A>tasted nothing."
<A NAME="518"></A><BR><BR>As he spoke Achilles told his men and the women-servants to set 
<A NAME="519"></A>beds in the room that was in the gatehouse, and make them with good red 
<A NAME="520"></A>rugs, and spread coverlets on the top of them with woollen cloaks for Priam 
<A NAME="521"></A>and Idaeus to wear. So the maids went out carrying a torch and got the 
<A NAME="522"></A>two beds ready in all haste. Then Achilles said laughingly to Priam, "Dear 
<A NAME="523"></A>sir, you shall lie outside, lest some counsellor of those who in due course 
<A NAME="524"></A>keep coming to advise with me should see you here in the darkness of the 
<A NAME="525"></A>flying night, and tell it to Agamemnon. This might cause delay in the delivery 
<A NAME="526"></A>of the body. And now tell me and tell me true, for how many days would 
<A NAME="527"></A>you celebrate the funeral rites of noble Hector? Tell me, that I may hold 
<A NAME="528"></A>aloof from war and restrain the host."
<A NAME="529"></A><BR><BR>And Priam answered, "Since, then, you suffer me to bury my noble 
<A NAME="530"></A>son with all due rites, do thus, Achilles, and I shall be grateful. You 
<A NAME="531"></A>know how we are pent up within our city; it is far for us to fetch wood 
<A NAME="532"></A>from the mountain, and the people live in fear. Nine days, therefore, will 
<A NAME="533"></A>we mourn Hector in my house; on the tenth day we will bury him and there 
<A NAME="534"></A>shall be a public feast in his honour; on the eleventh we will build a 
<A NAME="535"></A>mound over his ashes, and on the twelfth, if there be need, we will 
<A NAME="536"></A>fight."
<A NAME="537"></A><BR><BR>And Achilles answered, "All, King Priam, shall be as you have said. 
<A NAME="538"></A>I will stay our fighting for as long a time as you have 
<A NAME="539"></A>named."
<A NAME="540"></A><BR><BR>As he spoke he laid his hand on the old man's right wrist, in token 
<A NAME="541"></A>that he should have no fear; thus then did Priam and his attendant sleep 
<A NAME="542"></A>there in the forecourt, full of thought, while Achilles lay in an inner 
<A NAME="543"></A>room of the house, with fair Briseis by his side.
<A NAME="544"></A><BR><BR>And now both gods and mortals were fast asleep through the livelong 
<A NAME="545"></A>night, but upon Mercury alone, the bringer of good luck, sleep could take 
<A NAME="546"></A>no hold for he was thinking all the time how to get King Priam away from 
<A NAME="547"></A>the ships without his being seen by the strong force of sentinels. He hovered 
<A NAME="548"></A>therefore over Priam's head and said, "Sir, now that Achilles has spared 
<A NAME="549"></A>your life, you seem to have no fear about sleeping in the thick of your 
<A NAME="550"></A>foes. You have paid a great ransom, and have received the body of your 
<A NAME="551"></A>son; were you still alive and a prisoner the sons whom you have left at 
<A NAME="552"></A>home would have to give three times as much to free you; and so it would 
<A NAME="553"></A>be if Agamemnon and the other Achaeans were to know of your being 
<A NAME="554"></A>here."
<A NAME="555"></A><BR><BR>When he heard this the old man was afraid and roused his servant. 
<A NAME="556"></A>Mercury then yoked their horses and mules, and drove them quickly through 
<A NAME="557"></A>the host so that no man perceived them. When they came to the ford of eddying 
<A NAME="558"></A>Xanthus, begotten of immortal Jove, Mercury went back to high Olympus, 
<A NAME="559"></A>and dawn in robe of saffron began to break over all the land. Priam and 
<A NAME="560"></A>Idaeus then drove on toward the city lamenting and making moan, and the 
<A NAME="561"></A>mules drew the body of Hector. No one neither man nor woman saw them, till 
<A NAME="562"></A>Cassandra, fair as golden Venus standing on Pergamus, caught sight of her 
<A NAME="563"></A>dear father in his chariot, and his servant that was the city's herald 
<A NAME="564"></A>with him. Then she saw him that was lying upon the bier, drawn by the mules, 
<A NAME="565"></A>and with a loud cry she went about the city saying, "Come hither Trojans, 
<A NAME="566"></A>men and women, and look on Hector; if ever you rejoiced to see him coming 
<A NAME="567"></A>from battle when he was alive, look now on him that was the glory of our 
<A NAME="568"></A>city and all our people."
<A NAME="569"></A><BR><BR>At this there was not man nor woman left in the city, so great 
<A NAME="570"></A>a sorrow had possessed them. Hard by the gates they met Priam as he was 
<A NAME="571"></A>bringing in the body. Hector's wife and his mother were the first to mourn 
<A NAME="572"></A>him: they flew towards the waggon and laid their hands upon his head, while 
<A NAME="573"></A>the crowd stood weeping round them. They would have stayed before the gates, 
<A NAME="574"></A>weeping and lamenting the livelong day to the going down of the sun, had 
<A NAME="575"></A>not Priam spoken to them from the chariot and said, "Make way for the mules 
<A NAME="576"></A>to pass you. Afterwards when I have taken the body home you shall have 
<A NAME="577"></A>your fill of weeping."
<A NAME="578"></A><BR><BR>On this the people stood asunder, and made a way for the waggon. 
<A NAME="579"></A>When they had borne the body within the house they laid it upon a bed and 
<A NAME="580"></A>seated minstrels round it to lead the dirge, whereon the women joined in 
<A NAME="581"></A>the sad music of their lament. Foremost among them all Andromache led their 
<A NAME="582"></A>wailing as she clasped the head of mighty Hector in her embrace. "Husband," 
<A NAME="583"></A>she cried, "you have died young, and leave me in your house a widow; he 
<A NAME="584"></A>of whom we are the ill-starred parents is still a mere child, and I fear 
<A NAME="585"></A>he may not reach manhood. Ere he can do so our city will be razed and overthrown, 
<A NAME="586"></A>for you who watched over it are no more- you who were its saviour, the 
<A NAME="587"></A>guardian of our wives and children. Our women will be carried away captives 
<A NAME="588"></A>to the ships, and I among them; while you, my child, who will be with me 
<A NAME="589"></A>will be put to some unseemly tasks, working for a cruel master. Or, may 
<A NAME="590"></A>be, some Achaean will hurl you (O miserable death) from our walls, to avenge 
<A NAME="591"></A>some brother, son, or father whom Hector slew; many of them have indeed 
<A NAME="592"></A>bitten the dust at his hands, for your father's hand in battle was no light 
<A NAME="593"></A>one. Therefore do the people mourn him. You have left, O Hector, sorrow 
<A NAME="594"></A>unutterable to your parents, and my own grief is greatest of all, for you 
<A NAME="595"></A>did not stretch forth your arms and embrace me as you lay dying, nor say 
<A NAME="596"></A>to me any words that might have lived with me in my tears night and day 
<A NAME="597"></A>for evermore."
<A NAME="598"></A><BR><BR>Bitterly did she weep the while, and the women joined in her lament. 
<A NAME="599"></A>Hecuba in her turn took up the strains of woe. "Hector," she cried, "dearest 
<A NAME="600"></A>to me of all my children. So long as you were alive the gods loved you 
<A NAME="601"></A>well, and even in death they have not been utterly unmindful of you; for 
<A NAME="602"></A>when Achilles took any other of my sons, he would sell him beyond the seas, 
<A NAME="603"></A>to Samos Imbrus or rugged Lemnos; and when he had slain you too with his 
<A NAME="604"></A>sword, many a time did he drag you round the sepulchre of his comrade- 
<A NAME="605"></A>though this could not give him life- yet here you lie all fresh as dew, 
<A NAME="606"></A>and comely as one whom Apollo has slain with his painless 
<A NAME="607"></A>shafts."
<A NAME="608"></A><BR><BR>Thus did she too speak through her tears with bitter moan, and 
<A NAME="609"></A>then Helen for a third time took up the strain of lamentation. "Hector," 
<A NAME="610"></A>said she, "dearest of all my brothers-in-law-for I am wife to Alexandrus 
<A NAME="611"></A>who brought me hither to Troy- would that I had died ere he did so- twenty 
<A NAME="612"></A>years are come and gone since I left my home and came from over the sea, 
<A NAME="613"></A>but I have never heard one word of insult or unkindness from you. When 
<A NAME="614"></A>another would chide with me, as it might be one of your brothers or sisters 
<A NAME="615"></A>or of your brothers' wives, or my mother-in-law- for Priam was as kind 
<A NAME="616"></A>to me as though he were my own father- you would rebuke and check them 
<A NAME="617"></A>with words of gentleness and goodwill. Therefore my tears flow both for 
<A NAME="618"></A>you and for my unhappy self, for there is no one else in Troy who is kind 
<A NAME="619"></A>to me, but all shrink and shudder as they go by me."
<A NAME="620"></A><BR><BR>She wept as she spoke and the vast crowd that was gathered round 
<A NAME="621"></A>her joined in her lament. Then King Priam spoke to them saying, "Bring 
<A NAME="622"></A>wood, O Trojans, to the city, and fear no cunning ambush of the Argives, 
<A NAME="623"></A>for Achilles when he dismissed me from the ships gave me his word that 
<A NAME="624"></A>they should not attack us until the morning of the twelfth 
<A NAME="625"></A>day."
<A NAME="626"></A><BR><BR>Forthwith they yoked their oxen and mules and gathered together 
<A NAME="627"></A>before the city. Nine days long did they bring in great heaps wood, and 
<A NAME="628"></A>on the morning of the tenth day with many tears they took trave Hector 
<A NAME="629"></A>forth, laid his dead body upon the summit of the pile, and set the fire 
<A NAME="630"></A>thereto. Then when the child of morning rosy-fingered dawn appeared on 
<A NAME="631"></A>the eleventh day, the people again assembled, round the pyre of mighty 
<A NAME="632"></A>Hector. When they were got together, they first quenched the fire with 
<A NAME="633"></A>wine wherever it was burning, and then his brothers and comrades with many 
<A NAME="634"></A>a bitter tear gathered his white bones, wrapped them in soft robes of purple, 
<A NAME="635"></A>and laid them in a golden urn, which they placed in a grave and covered 
<A NAME="636"></A>over with large stones set close together. Then they built a barrow hurriedly 
<A NAME="637"></A>over it keeping guard on every side lest the Achaeans should attack them 
<A NAME="638"></A>before they had finished. When they had heaped up the barrow they went 
<A NAME="639"></A>back again into the city, and being well assembled they held high feast 
<A NAME="640"></A>in the house of Priam their king.
<A NAME="641"></A><BR><BR>Thus, then, did they celebrate the funeral of Hector tamer of 
<A NAME="642"></A>horses.
