<A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A>Now when the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, Alcinous and 
<A NAME="11"></A>Ulysses both rose, and Alcinous led the way to the Phaecian place of assembly, 
<A NAME="12"></A>which was near the ships. When they got there they sat down side by side 
<A NAME="13"></A>on a seat of polished stone, while Minerva took the form of one of Alcinous' 
<A NAME="14"></A>servants, and went round the town in order to help Ulysses to get home. 
<A NAME="15"></A>She went up to the citizens, man by man, and said, "Aldermen and town councillors 
<A NAME="16"></A>of the Phaeacians, come to the assembly all of you and listen to the stranger 
<A NAME="17"></A>who has just come off a long voyage to the house of King Alcinous; he looks 
<A NAME="18"></A>like an immortal god."
<A NAME="19"></A><BR><BR>With these words she made them all want to come, and they flocked 
<A NAME="20"></A>to the assembly till seats and standing room were alike crowded. Every 
<A NAME="21"></A>one was struck with the appearance of Ulysses, for Minerva had beautified 
<A NAME="22"></A>him about the head and shoulders, making him look taller and stouter than 
<A NAME="23"></A>he really was, that he might impress the Phaecians favourably as being 
<A NAME="24"></A>a very remarkable man, and might come off well in the many trials of skill 
<A NAME="25"></A>to which they would challenge him. Then, when they were got together, Alcinous 
<A NAME="26"></A>spoke:
<A NAME="27"></A><BR><BR>"Hear me," said he, "aldermen and town councillors of the Phaeacians, 
<A NAME="28"></A>that I may speak even as I am minded. This stranger, whoever he may be, 
<A NAME="29"></A>has found his way to my house from somewhere or other either East or West. 
<A NAME="30"></A>He wants an escort and wishes to have the matter settled. Let us then get 
<A NAME="31"></A>one ready for him, as we have done for others before him; indeed, no one 
<A NAME="32"></A>who ever yet came to my house has been able to complain of me for not speeding 
<A NAME="33"></A>on his way soon enough. Let us draw a ship into the sea- one that has never 
<A NAME="34"></A>yet made a voyage- and man her with two and fifty of our smartest young 
<A NAME="35"></A>sailors. Then when you have made fast your oars each by his own seat, leave 
<A NAME="36"></A>the ship and come to my house to prepare a feast. I will find you in everything. 
<A NAME="37"></A>I am giving will these instructions to the young men who will form the 
<A NAME="38"></A>crew, for as regards you aldermen and town councillors, you will join me 
<A NAME="39"></A>in entertaining our guest in the cloisters. I can take no excuses, and 
<A NAME="40"></A>we will have Demodocus to sing to us; for there is no bard like him whatever 
<A NAME="41"></A>he may choose to sing about."
<A NAME="42"></A><BR><BR>Alcinous then led the way, and the others followed after, while 
<A NAME="43"></A>a servant went to fetch Demodocus. The fifty-two picked oarsmen went to 
<A NAME="44"></A>the sea shore as they had been told, and when they got there they drew 
<A NAME="45"></A>the ship into the water, got her mast and sails inside her, bound the oars 
<A NAME="46"></A>to the thole-pins with twisted thongs of leather, all in due course, and 
<A NAME="47"></A>spread the white sails aloft. They moored the vessel a little way out from 
<A NAME="48"></A>land, and then came on shore and went to the house of King Alcinous. The 
<A NAME="49"></A>outhouses, yards, and all the precincts were filled with crowds of men 
<A NAME="50"></A>in great multitudes both old and young; and Alcinous killed them a dozen 
<A NAME="51"></A>sheep, eight full grown pigs, and two oxen. These they skinned and dressed 
<A NAME="52"></A>so as to provide a magnificent banquet.
<A NAME="53"></A><BR><BR>A servant presently led in the famous bard Demodocus, whom the 
<A NAME="54"></A>muse had dearly loved, but to whom she had given both good and evil, for 
<A NAME="55"></A>though she had endowed him with a divine gift of song, she had robbed him 
<A NAME="56"></A>of his eyesight. Pontonous set a seat for him among the guests, leaning 
<A NAME="57"></A>it up against a bearing-post. He hung the lyre for him on a peg over his 
<A NAME="58"></A>head, and showed him where he was to feel for it with his hands. He also 
<A NAME="59"></A>set a fair table with a basket of victuals by his side, and a cup of wine 
<A NAME="60"></A>from which he might drink whenever he was so disposed.
<A NAME="61"></A><BR><BR>The company then laid their hands upon the good things that were 
<A NAME="62"></A>before them, but as soon as they had had enough to eat and drink, the muse 
<A NAME="63"></A>inspired Demodocus to sing the feats of heroes, and more especially a matter 
<A NAME="64"></A>that was then in the mouths of all men, to wit, the quarrel between Ulysses 
<A NAME="65"></A>and Achilles, and the fierce words that they heaped on one another as they 
<A NAME="66"></A>gat together at a banquet. But Agamemnon was glad when he heard his chieftains 
<A NAME="67"></A>quarrelling with one another, for Apollo had foretold him this at Pytho 
<A NAME="68"></A>when he crossed the stone floor to consult the oracle. Here was the beginning 
<A NAME="69"></A>of the evil that by the will of Jove fell both Danaans and 
<A NAME="70"></A>Trojans.
<A NAME="71"></A><BR><BR>Thus sang the bard, but Ulysses drew his purple mantle over his 
<A NAME="72"></A>head and covered his face, for he was ashamed to let the Phaeacians see 
<A NAME="73"></A>that he was weeping. When the bard left off singing he wiped the tears 
<A NAME="74"></A>from his eyes, uncovered his face, and, taking his cup, made a drink-offering 
<A NAME="75"></A>to the gods; but when the Phaeacians pressed Demodocus to sing further, 
<A NAME="76"></A>for they delighted in his lays, then Ulysses again drew his mantle over 
<A NAME="77"></A>his head and wept bitterly. No one noticed his distress except Alcinous, 
<A NAME="78"></A>who was sitting near him, and heard the heavy sighs that he was heaving. 
<A NAME="79"></A>So he at once said, "Aldermen and town councillors of the Phaeacians, we 
<A NAME="80"></A>have had enough now, both of the feast, and of the minstrelsy that is its 
<A NAME="81"></A>due accompaniment; let us proceed therefore to the athletic sports, so 
<A NAME="82"></A>that our guest on his return home may be able to tell his friends how much 
<A NAME="83"></A>we surpass all other nations as boxers, wrestlers, jumpers, and 
<A NAME="84"></A>runners."
<A NAME="85"></A><BR><BR>With these words he led the way, and the others followed after. 
<A NAME="86"></A>A servant hung Demodocus's lyre on its peg for him, led him out of the 
<A NAME="87"></A>cloister, and set him on the same way as that along which all the chief 
<A NAME="88"></A>men of the Phaeacians were going to see the sports; a crowd of several 
<A NAME="89"></A>thousands of people followed them, and there were many excellent competitors 
<A NAME="90"></A>for all the prizes. Acroneos, Ocyalus, Elatreus, Nauteus, Prymneus, Anchialus, 
<A NAME="91"></A>Eretmeus, Ponteus, Proreus, Thoon, Anabesineus, and Amphialus son of Polyneus 
<A NAME="92"></A>son of Tecton. There was also Euryalus son of Naubolus, who was like Mars 
<A NAME="93"></A>himself, and was the best looking man among the Phaecians except Laodamas. 
<A NAME="94"></A>Three sons of Alcinous, Laodamas, Halios, and Clytoneus, competed 
<A NAME="95"></A>also.
<A NAME="96"></A><BR><BR>The foot races came first. The course was set out for them from 
<A NAME="97"></A>the starting post, and they raised a dust upon the plain as they all flew 
<A NAME="98"></A>forward at the same moment. Clytoneus came in first by a long way; he left 
<A NAME="99"></A>every one else behind him by the length of the furrow that a couple of 
<A NAME="100"></A>mules can plough in a fallow field. They then turned to the painful art 
<A NAME="101"></A>of wrestling, and here Euryalus proved to be the best man. Amphialus excelled 
<A NAME="102"></A>all the others in jumping, while at throwing the disc there was no one 
<A NAME="103"></A>who could approach Elatreus. Alcinous's son Laodamas was the best boxer, 
<A NAME="104"></A>and he it was who presently said, when they had all been diverted with 
<A NAME="105"></A>the games, "Let us ask the stranger whether he excels in any of these sports; 
<A NAME="106"></A>he seems very powerfully built; his thighs, claves, hands, and neck are 
<A NAME="107"></A>of prodigious strength, nor is he at all old, but he has suffered much 
<A NAME="108"></A>lately, and there is nothing like the sea for making havoc with a man, 
<A NAME="109"></A>no matter how strong he is."
<A NAME="110"></A><BR><BR>"You are quite right, Laodamas," replied Euryalus, "go up to your 
<A NAME="111"></A>guest and speak to him about it yourself."
<A NAME="112"></A><BR><BR>When Laodamas heard this he made his way into the middle of the 
<A NAME="113"></A>crowd and said to Ulysses, "I hope, Sir, that you will enter yourself for 
<A NAME="114"></A>some one or other of our competitions if you are skilled in any of them- 
<A NAME="115"></A>and you must have gone in for many a one before now. There is nothing that 
<A NAME="116"></A>does any one so much credit all his life long as the showing himself a 
<A NAME="117"></A>proper man with his hands and feet. Have a try therefore at something, 
<A NAME="118"></A>and banish all sorrow from your mind. Your return home will not be long 
<A NAME="119"></A>delayed, for the ship is already drawn into the water, and the crew is 
<A NAME="120"></A>found."
<A NAME="121"></A><BR><BR>Ulysses answered, "Laodamas, why do you taunt me in this way? my 
<A NAME="122"></A>mind is set rather on cares than contests; I have been through infinite 
<A NAME="123"></A>trouble, and am come among you now as a suppliant, praying your king and 
<A NAME="124"></A>people to further me on my return home."
<A NAME="125"></A><BR><BR>Then Euryalus reviled him outright and said, "I gather, then, that 
<A NAME="126"></A>you are unskilled in any of the many sports that men generally delight 
<A NAME="127"></A>in. I suppose you are one of those grasping traders that go about in ships 
<A NAME="128"></A>as captains or merchants, and who think of nothing but of their outward 
<A NAME="129"></A>freights and homeward cargoes. There does not seem to be much of the athlete 
<A NAME="130"></A>about you."
<A NAME="131"></A><BR><BR>"For shame, Sir," answered Ulysses, fiercely, "you are an insolent 
<A NAME="132"></A>fellow- so true is it that the gods do not grace all men alike in speech, 
<A NAME="133"></A>person, and understanding. One man may be of weak presence, but heaven 
<A NAME="134"></A>has adorned this with such a good conversation that he charms every one 
<A NAME="135"></A>who sees him; his honeyed moderation carries his hearers with him so that 
<A NAME="136"></A>he is leader in all assemblies of his fellows, and wherever he goes he 
<A NAME="137"></A>is looked up to. Another may be as handsome as a god, but his good looks 
<A NAME="138"></A>are not crowned with discretion. This is your case. No god could make a 
<A NAME="139"></A>finer looking fellow than you are, but you are a fool. Your ill-judged 
<A NAME="140"></A>remarks have made me exceedingly angry, and you are quite mistaken, for 
<A NAME="141"></A>I excel in a great many athletic exercises; indeed, so long as I had youth 
<A NAME="142"></A>and strength, I was among the first athletes of the age. Now, however, 
<A NAME="143"></A>I am worn out by labour and sorrow, for I have gone through much both on 
<A NAME="144"></A>the field of battle and by the waves of the weary sea; still, in spite 
<A NAME="145"></A>of all this I will compete, for your taunts have stung me to the 
<A NAME="146"></A>quick."
<A NAME="147"></A><BR><BR>So he hurried up without even taking his cloak off, and seized 
<A NAME="148"></A>a disc, larger, more massive and much heavier than those used by the Phaeacians 
<A NAME="149"></A>when disc-throwing among themselves. Then, swinging it back, he threw it 
<A NAME="150"></A>from his brawny hand, and it made a humming sound in the air as he did 
<A NAME="151"></A>so. The Phaeacians quailed beneath the rushing of its flight as it sped 
<A NAME="152"></A>gracefully from his hand, and flew beyond any mark that had been made yet. 
<A NAME="153"></A>Minerva, in the form of a man, came and marked the place where it had fallen. 
<A NAME="154"></A>"A blind man, Sir," said she, "could easily tell your mark by groping for 
<A NAME="155"></A>it- it is so far ahead of any other. You may make your mind easy about 
<A NAME="156"></A>this contest, for no Phaeacian can come near to such a throw as 
<A NAME="157"></A>yours."
<A NAME="158"></A><BR><BR>Ulysses was glad when he found he had a friend among the lookers-on, 
<A NAME="159"></A>so he began to speak more pleasantly. "Young men," said he, "come up to 
<A NAME="160"></A>that throw if you can, and I will throw another disc as heavy or even heavier. 
<A NAME="161"></A>If anyone wants to have a bout with me let him come on, for I am exceedingly 
<A NAME="162"></A>angry; I will box, wrestle, or run, I do not care what it is, with any 
<A NAME="163"></A>man of you all except Laodamas, but not with him because I am his guest, 
<A NAME="164"></A>and one cannot compete with one's own personal friend. At least I do not 
<A NAME="165"></A>think it a prudent or a sensible thing for a guest to challenge his host's 
<A NAME="166"></A>family at any game, especially when he is in a foreign country. He will 
<A NAME="167"></A>cut the ground from under his own feet if he does; but I make no exception 
<A NAME="168"></A>as regards any one else, for I want to have the matter out and know which 
<A NAME="169"></A>is the best man. I am a good hand at every kind of athletic sport known 
<A NAME="170"></A>among mankind. I am an excellent archer. In battle I am always the first 
<A NAME="171"></A>to bring a man down with my arrow, no matter how many more are taking aim 
<A NAME="172"></A>at him alongside of me. Philoctetes was the only man who could shoot better 
<A NAME="173"></A>than I could when we Achaeans were before Troy and in practice. I far excel 
<A NAME="174"></A>every one else in the whole world, of those who still eat bread upon the 
<A NAME="175"></A>face of the earth, but I should not like to shoot against the mighty dead, 
<A NAME="176"></A>such as Hercules, or Eurytus the Cechalian-men who could shoot against 
<A NAME="177"></A>the gods themselves. This in fact was how Eurytus came prematurely by his 
<A NAME="178"></A>end, for Apollo was angry with him and killed him because he challenged 
<A NAME="179"></A>him as an archer. I can throw a dart farther than any one else can shoot 
<A NAME="180"></A>an arrow. Running is the only point in respect of which I am afraid some 
<A NAME="181"></A>of the Phaecians might beat me, for I have been brought down very low at 
<A NAME="182"></A>sea; my provisions ran short, and therefore I am still 
<A NAME="183"></A>weak."
<A NAME="184"></A><BR><BR>They all held their peace except King Alcinous, who began, "Sir, 
<A NAME="185"></A>we have had much pleasure in hearing all that you have told us, from which 
<A NAME="186"></A>I understand that you are willing to show your prowess, as having been 
<A NAME="187"></A>displeased with some insolent remarks that have been made to you by one 
<A NAME="188"></A>of our athletes, and which could never have been uttered by any one who 
<A NAME="189"></A>knows how to talk with propriety. I hope you will apprehend my meaning, 
<A NAME="190"></A>and will explain to any be one of your chief men who may be dining with 
<A NAME="191"></A>yourself and your family when you get home, that we have an hereditary 
<A NAME="192"></A>aptitude for accomplishments of all kinds. We are not particularly remarkable 
<A NAME="193"></A>for our boxing, nor yet as wrestlers, but we are singularly fleet of foot 
<A NAME="194"></A>and are excellent sailors. We are extremely fond of good dinners, music, 
<A NAME="195"></A>and dancing; we also like frequent changes of linen, warm baths, and good 
<A NAME="196"></A>beds, so now, please, some of you who are the best dancers set about dancing, 
<A NAME="197"></A>that our guest on his return home may be able to tell his friends how much 
<A NAME="198"></A>we surpass all other nations as sailors, runners, dancers, minstrels. Demodocus 
<A NAME="199"></A>has left his lyre at my house, so run some one or other of you and fetch 
<A NAME="200"></A>it for him."
<A NAME="201"></A><BR><BR>On this a servant hurried off to bring the lyre from the king's 
<A NAME="202"></A>house, and the nine men who had been chosen as stewards stood forward. 
<A NAME="203"></A>It was their business to manage everything connected with the sports, so 
<A NAME="204"></A>they made the ground smooth and marked a wide space for the dancers. Presently 
<A NAME="205"></A>the servant came back with Demodocus's lyre, and he took his place in the 
<A NAME="206"></A>midst of them, whereon the best young dancers in the town began to foot 
<A NAME="207"></A>and trip it so nimbly that Ulysses was delighted with the merry twinkling 
<A NAME="208"></A>of their feet.
<A NAME="209"></A><BR><BR>Meanwhile the bard began to sing the loves of Mars and Venus, and 
<A NAME="210"></A>how they first began their intrigue in the house of Vulcan. Mars made Venus 
<A NAME="211"></A>many presents, and defiled King Vulcan's marriage bed, so the sun, who 
<A NAME="212"></A>saw what they were about, told Vulcan. Vulcan was very angry when he heard 
<A NAME="213"></A>such dreadful news, so he went to his smithy brooding mischief, got his 
<A NAME="214"></A>great anvil into its place, and began to forge some chains which none could 
<A NAME="215"></A>either unloose or break, so that they might stay there in that place. When 
<A NAME="216"></A>he had finished his snare he went into his bedroom and festooned the bed-posts 
<A NAME="217"></A>all over with chains like cobwebs; he also let many hang down from the 
<A NAME="218"></A>great beam of the ceiling. Not even a god could see them, so fine and subtle 
<A NAME="219"></A>were they. As soon as he had spread the chains all over the bed, he made 
<A NAME="220"></A>as though he were setting out for the fair state of Lemnos, which of all 
<A NAME="221"></A>places in the world was the one he was most fond of. But Mars kept no blind 
<A NAME="222"></A>look out, and as soon as he saw him start, hurried off to his house, burning 
<A NAME="223"></A>with love for Venus.
<A NAME="224"></A><BR><BR>Now Venus was just come in from a visit to her father Jove, and 
<A NAME="225"></A>was about sitting down when Mars came inside the house, an said as he took 
<A NAME="226"></A>her hand in his own, "Let us go to the couch of Vulcan: he is not at home, 
<A NAME="227"></A>but is gone off to Lemnos among the Sintians, whose speech is 
<A NAME="228"></A>barbarous."
<A NAME="229"></A><BR><BR>She was nothing loth, so they went to the couch to take their rest, 
<A NAME="230"></A>whereon they were caught in the toils which cunning Vulcan had spread for 
<A NAME="231"></A>them, and could neither get up nor stir hand or foot, but found too late 
<A NAME="232"></A>that they were in a trap. Then Vulcan came up to them, for he had turned 
<A NAME="233"></A>back before reaching Lemnos, when his scout the sun told him what was going 
<A NAME="234"></A>on. He was in a furious passion, and stood in the vestibule making a dreadful 
<A NAME="235"></A>noise as he shouted to all the gods.
<A NAME="236"></A><BR><BR>"Father Jove," he cried, "and all you other blessed gods who live 
<A NAME="237"></A>for ever, come here and see the ridiculous and disgraceful sight that I 
<A NAME="238"></A>will show you. Jove's daughter Venus is always dishonouring me because 
<A NAME="239"></A>I am lame. She is in love with Mars, who is handsome and clean built, whereas 
<A NAME="240"></A>I am a cripple- but my parents are to blame for that, not I; they ought 
<A NAME="241"></A>never to have begotten me. Come and see the pair together asleep on my 
<A NAME="242"></A>bed. It makes me furious to look at them. They are very fond of one another, 
<A NAME="243"></A>but I do not think they will lie there longer than they can help, nor do 
<A NAME="244"></A>I think that they will sleep much; there, however, they shall stay till 
<A NAME="245"></A>her father has repaid me the sum I gave him for his baggage of a daughter, 
<A NAME="246"></A>who is fair but not honest."
<A NAME="247"></A><BR><BR>On this the gods gathered to the house of Vulcan. Earth-encircling 
<A NAME="248"></A>Neptune came, and Mercury the bringer of luck, and King Apollo, but the 
<A NAME="249"></A>goddesses stayed at home all of them for shame. Then the givers of all 
<A NAME="250"></A>good things stood in the doorway, and the blessed gods roared with inextinguishable 
<A NAME="251"></A>laughter, as they saw how cunning Vulcan had been, whereon one would turn 
<A NAME="252"></A>towards his neighbour saying:
<A NAME="253"></A><BR><BR>"Ill deeds do not prosper, and the weak confound the strong. See 
<A NAME="254"></A>how limping Vulcan, lame as he is, has caught Mars who is the fleetest 
<A NAME="255"></A>god in heaven; and now Mars will be cast in heavy damages."
<A NAME="256"></A><BR><BR>Thus did they converse, but King Apollo said to Mercury, "Messenger 
<A NAME="257"></A>Mercury, giver of good things, you would not care how strong the chains 
<A NAME="258"></A>were, would you, if you could sleep with Venus?"
<A NAME="259"></A><BR><BR>"King Apollo," answered Mercury, "I only wish I might get the chance, 
<A NAME="260"></A>though there were three times as many chains- and you might look on, all 
<A NAME="261"></A>of you, gods and goddesses, but would sleep with her if I 
<A NAME="262"></A>could."
<A NAME="263"></A><BR><BR>The immortal gods burst out laughing as they heard him, but Neptune 
<A NAME="264"></A>took it all seriously, and kept on imploring Vulcan to set Mars free again. 
<A NAME="265"></A>"Let him go," he cried, "and I will undertake, as you require, that he 
<A NAME="266"></A>shall pay you all the damages that are held reasonable among the immortal 
<A NAME="267"></A>gods."
<A NAME="268"></A><BR><BR>"Do not," replied Vulcan, "ask me to do this; a bad man's bond 
<A NAME="269"></A>is bad security; what remedy could I enforce against you if Mars should 
<A NAME="270"></A>go away and leave his debts behind him along with his 
<A NAME="271"></A>chains?"
<A NAME="272"></A><BR><BR>"Vulcan," said Neptune, "if Mars goes away without paying his damages, 
<A NAME="273"></A>I will pay you myself." So Vulcan answered, "In this case I cannot and 
<A NAME="274"></A>must not refuse you."
<A NAME="275"></A><BR><BR>Thereon he loosed the bonds that bound them, and as soon as they 
<A NAME="276"></A>were free they scampered off, Mars to Thrace and laughter-loving Venus 
<A NAME="277"></A>to Cyprus and to Paphos, where is her grove and her altar fragrant with 
<A NAME="278"></A>burnt offerings. Here the Graces hathed her, and anointed her with oil 
<A NAME="279"></A>of ambrosia such as the immortal gods make use of, and they clothed her 
<A NAME="280"></A>in raiment of the most enchanting beauty.
<A NAME="281"></A><BR><BR>Thus sang the bard, and both Ulysses and the seafaring Phaeacians 
<A NAME="282"></A>were charmed as they heard him.
<A NAME="283"></A><BR><BR>Then Alcinous told Laodamas and Halius to dance alone, for there 
<A NAME="284"></A>was no one to compete with them. So they took a red ball which Polybus 
<A NAME="285"></A>had made for them, and one of them bent himself backwards and threw it 
<A NAME="286"></A>up towards the clouds, while the other jumped from off the ground and caught 
<A NAME="287"></A>it with ease before it came down again. When they had done throwing the 
<A NAME="288"></A>ball straight up into the air they began to dance, and at the same time 
<A NAME="289"></A>kept on throwing it backwards and forwards to one another, while all the 
<A NAME="290"></A>young men in the ring applauded and made a great stamping with their feet. 
<A NAME="291"></A>Then Ulysses said:
<A NAME="292"></A><BR><BR>"King Alcinous, you said your people were the nimblest dancers 
<A NAME="293"></A>in the world, and indeed they have proved themselves to be so. I was astonished 
<A NAME="294"></A>as I saw them."
<A NAME="295"></A><BR><BR>The king was delighted at this, and exclaimed to the Phaecians 
<A NAME="296"></A>"Aldermen and town councillors, our guest seems to be a person of singular 
<A NAME="297"></A>judgement; let us give him such proof of our hospitality as he may reasonably 
<A NAME="298"></A>expect. There are twelve chief men among you, and counting myself there 
<A NAME="299"></A>are thirteen; contribute, each of you, a clean cloak, a shirt, and a talent 
<A NAME="300"></A>of fine gold; let us give him all this in a lump down at once, so that 
<A NAME="301"></A>when he gets his supper he may do so with a light heart. As for Euryalus 
<A NAME="302"></A>he will have to make a formal apology and a present too, for he has been 
<A NAME="303"></A>rude."
<A NAME="304"></A><BR><BR>Thus did he speak. The others all of them applauded his saying, 
<A NAME="305"></A>and sent their servants to fetch the presents. Then Euryalus said, "King 
<A NAME="306"></A>Alcinous, I will give the stranger all the satisfaction you require. He 
<A NAME="307"></A>shall have sword, which is of bronze, all but the hilt, which is of silver. 
<A NAME="308"></A>I will also give him the scabbard of newly sawn ivory into which it fits. 
<A NAME="309"></A>It will be worth a great deal to him."
<A NAME="310"></A><BR><BR>As he spoke he placed the sword in the hands of Ulysses and said, 
<A NAME="311"></A>"Good luck to you, father stranger; if anything has been said amiss may 
<A NAME="312"></A>the winds blow it away with them, and may heaven grant you a safe return, 
<A NAME="313"></A>for I understand you have been long away from home, and have gone through 
<A NAME="314"></A>much hardship."
<A NAME="315"></A><BR><BR>To which Ulysses answered, "Good luck to you too my friend, and 
<A NAME="316"></A>may the gods grant you every happiness. I hope you will not miss the sword 
<A NAME="317"></A>you have given me along with your apology."
<A NAME="318"></A><BR><BR>With these words he girded the sword about his shoulders and towards 
<A NAME="319"></A>sundown the presents began to make their appearance, as the servants of 
<A NAME="320"></A>the donors kept bringing them to the house of King Alcinous; here his sons 
<A NAME="321"></A>received them, and placed them under their mother's charge. Then Alcinous 
<A NAME="322"></A>led the way to the house and bade his guests take their 
<A NAME="323"></A>seats.
<A NAME="324"></A><BR><BR>"Wife," said he, turning to Queen Arete, "Go, fetch the best chest 
<A NAME="325"></A>we have, and put a clean cloak and shirt in it. Also, set a copper on the 
<A NAME="326"></A>fire and heat some water; our guest will take a warm bath; see also to 
<A NAME="327"></A>the careful packing of the presents that the noble Phaeacians have made 
<A NAME="328"></A>him; he will thus better enjoy both his supper and the singing that will 
<A NAME="329"></A>follow. I shall myself give him this golden goblet- which is of exquisite 
<A NAME="330"></A>workmanship- that he may be reminded of me for the rest of his life whenever 
<A NAME="331"></A>he makes a drink-offering to Jove, or to any of the 
<A NAME="332"></A>gods."
<A NAME="333"></A><BR><BR>Then Arete told her maids to set a large tripod upon the fire as 
<A NAME="334"></A>fast as they could, whereon they set a tripod full of bath water on to 
<A NAME="335"></A>a clear fire; they threw on sticks to make it blaze, and the water became 
<A NAME="336"></A>hot as the flame played about the belly of the tripod. Meanwhile Arete 
<A NAME="337"></A>brought a magnificent chest her own room, and inside it she packed all 
<A NAME="338"></A>the beautiful presents of gold and raiment which the Phaeacians had brought. 
<A NAME="339"></A>Lastly she added a cloak and a good shirt from Alcinous, and said to 
<A NAME="340"></A>Ulysses:
<A NAME="341"></A><BR><BR>"See to the lid yourself, and have the whole bound round at once, 
<A NAME="342"></A>for fear any one should rob you by the way when you are asleep in your 
<A NAME="343"></A>ship."
<A NAME="344"></A><BR><BR>When Ulysses heard this he put the lid on the chest and made it 
<A NAME="345"></A>fast with a bond that Circe had taught him. He had done so before an upper 
<A NAME="346"></A>servant told him to come to the bath and wash himself. He was very glad 
<A NAME="347"></A>of a warm bath, for he had had no one to wait upon him ever since he left 
<A NAME="348"></A>the house of Calypso, who as long as he remained with her had taken as 
<A NAME="349"></A>good care of him as though he had been a god. When the servants had done 
<A NAME="350"></A>washing and anointing him with oil, and had given him a clean cloak and 
<A NAME="351"></A>shirt, he left the bath room and joined the guests who were sitting over 
<A NAME="352"></A>their wine. Lovely Nausicaa stood by one of the bearing-posts supporting 
<A NAME="353"></A>the roof if the cloister, and admired him as she saw him pass. "Farewell 
<A NAME="354"></A>stranger," said she, "do not forget me when you are safe at home again, 
<A NAME="355"></A>for it is to me first that you owe a ransom for having saved your 
<A NAME="356"></A>life."
<A NAME="357"></A><BR><BR>And Ulysses said, "Nausicaa, daughter of great Alcinous, may Jove 
<A NAME="358"></A>the mighty husband of Juno, grant that I may reach my home; so shall I 
<A NAME="359"></A>bless you as my guardian angel all my days, for it was you who saved 
<A NAME="360"></A>me."
<A NAME="361"></A><BR><BR>When he had said this, he seated himself beside Alcinous. Supper 
<A NAME="362"></A>was then served, and the wine was mixed for drinking. A servant led in 
<A NAME="363"></A>the favourite bard Demodocus, and set him in the midst of the company, 
<A NAME="364"></A>near one of the bearing-posts supporting the cloister, that he might lean 
<A NAME="365"></A>against it. Then Ulysses cut off a piece of roast pork with plenty of fat 
<A NAME="366"></A>(for there was abundance left on the joint) and said to a servant, "Take 
<A NAME="367"></A>this piece of pork over to Demodocus and tell him to eat it; for all the 
<A NAME="368"></A>pain his lays may cause me I will salute him none the less; bards are honoured 
<A NAME="369"></A>and respected throughout the world, for the muse teaches them their songs 
<A NAME="370"></A>and loves them."
<A NAME="371"></A><BR><BR>The servant carried the pork in his fingers over to Demodocus, 
<A NAME="372"></A>who took it and was very much pleased. They then laid their hands on the 
<A NAME="373"></A>good things that were before them, and as soon as they had had to eat and 
<A NAME="374"></A>drink, Ulysses said to Demodocus, "Demodocus, there is no one in the world 
<A NAME="375"></A>whom I admire more than I do you. You must have studied under the Muse, 
<A NAME="376"></A>Jove's daughter, and under Apollo, so accurately do you sing the return 
<A NAME="377"></A>of the Achaeans with all their sufferings and adventures. If you were not 
<A NAME="378"></A>there yourself, you must have heard it all from some one who was. Now, 
<A NAME="379"></A>however, change your song and tell us of the wooden horse which Epeus made 
<A NAME="380"></A>with the assistance of Minerva, and which Ulysses got by stratagem into 
<A NAME="381"></A>the fort of Troy after freighting it with the men who afterwards sacked 
<A NAME="382"></A>the city. If you will sing this tale aright I will tell all the world how 
<A NAME="383"></A>magnificently heaven has endowed you."
<A NAME="384"></A><BR><BR>The bard inspired of heaven took up the story at the point where 
<A NAME="385"></A>some of the Argives set fire to their tents and sailed away while others, 
<A NAME="386"></A>hidden within the horse, were waiting with Ulysses in the Trojan place 
<A NAME="387"></A>of assembly. For the Trojans themselves had drawn the horse into their 
<A NAME="388"></A>fortress, and it stood there while they sat in council round it, and were 
<A NAME="389"></A>in three minds as to what they should do. Some were for breaking it up 
<A NAME="390"></A>then and there; others would have it dragged to the top of the rock on 
<A NAME="391"></A>which the fortress stood, and then thrown down the precipice; while yet 
<A NAME="392"></A>others were for letting it remain as an offering and propitiation for the 
<A NAME="393"></A>gods. And this was how they settled it in the end, for the city was doomed 
<A NAME="394"></A>when it took in that horse, within which were all the bravest of the Argives 
<A NAME="395"></A>waiting to bring death and destruction on the Trojans. Anon he sang how 
<A NAME="396"></A>the sons of the Achaeans issued from the horse, and sacked the town, breaking 
<A NAME="397"></A>out from their ambuscade. He sang how they over ran the city hither and 
<A NAME="398"></A>thither and ravaged it, and how Ulysses went raging like Mars along with 
<A NAME="399"></A>Menelaus to the house of Deiphobus. It was there that the fight raged most 
<A NAME="400"></A>furiously, nevertheless by Minerva's help he was victorious.
<A NAME="401"></A><BR><BR>All this he told, but Ulysses was overcome as he heard him, and 
<A NAME="402"></A>his cheeks were wet with tears. He wept as a woman weeps when she throws 
<A NAME="403"></A>herself on the body of her husband who has fallen before his own city and 
<A NAME="404"></A>people, fighting bravely in defence of his home and children. She screams 
<A NAME="405"></A>aloud and flings her arms about him as he lies gasping for breath and dying, 
<A NAME="406"></A>but her enemies beat her from behind about the back and shoulders, and 
<A NAME="407"></A>carry her off into slavery, to a life of labour and sorrow, and the beauty 
<A NAME="408"></A>fades from her cheeks- even so piteously did Ulysses weep, but none of 
<A NAME="409"></A>those present perceived his tears except Alcinous, who was sitting near 
<A NAME="410"></A>him, and could hear the sobs and sighs that he was heaving. The king, therefore, 
<A NAME="411"></A>at once rose and said:
<A NAME="412"></A><BR><BR>"Aldermen and town councillors of the Phaeacians, let Demodocus 
<A NAME="413"></A>cease his song, for there are those present who do not seem to like it. 
<A NAME="414"></A>From the moment that we had done supper and Demodocus began to sing, our 
<A NAME="415"></A>guest has been all the time groaning and lamenting. He is evidently in 
<A NAME="416"></A>great trouble, so let the bard leave off, that we may all enjoy ourselves, 
<A NAME="417"></A>hosts and guest alike. This will be much more as it should be, for all 
<A NAME="418"></A>these festivities, with the escort and the presents that we are making 
<A NAME="419"></A>with so much good will, are wholly in his honour, and any one with even 
<A NAME="420"></A>a moderate amount of right feeling knows that he ought to treat a guest 
<A NAME="421"></A>and a suppliant as though he were his own brother.
<A NAME="422"></A><BR><BR>"Therefore, Sir, do you on your part affect no more concealment 
<A NAME="423"></A>nor reserve in the matter about which I shall ask you; it will be more 
<A NAME="424"></A>polite in you to give me a plain answer; tell me the name by which your 
<A NAME="425"></A>father and mother over yonder used to call you, and by which you were known 
<A NAME="426"></A>among your neighbours and fellow-citizens. There is no one, neither rich 
<A NAME="427"></A>nor poor, who is absolutely without any name whatever, for people's fathers 
<A NAME="428"></A>and mothers give them names as soon as they are born. Tell me also your 
<A NAME="429"></A>country, nation, and city, that our ships may shape their purpose accordingly 
<A NAME="430"></A>and take you there. For the Phaeacians have no pilots; their vessels have 
<A NAME="431"></A>no rudders as those of other nations have, but the ships themselves understand 
<A NAME="432"></A>what it is that we are thinking about and want; they know all the cities 
<A NAME="433"></A>and countries in the whole world, and can traverse the sea just as well 
<A NAME="434"></A>even when it is covered with mist and cloud, so that there is no danger 
<A NAME="435"></A>of being wrecked or coming to any harm. Still I do remember hearing my 
<A NAME="436"></A>father say that Neptune was angry with us for being too easy-going in the 
<A NAME="437"></A>matter of giving people escorts. He said that one of these days he should 
<A NAME="438"></A>wreck a ship of ours as it was returning from having escorted some one, 
<A NAME="439"></A>and bury our city under a high mountain. This is what my used to say, but 
<A NAME="440"></A>whether the god will carry out his threat or no is a matter which he will 
<A NAME="441"></A>decide for himself.
<A NAME="442"></A><BR><BR>"And now, tell me and tell me true. Where have you been wandering, 
<A NAME="443"></A>and in what countries have you travelled? Tell us of the peoples themselves, 
<A NAME="444"></A>and of their cities- who were hostile, savage and uncivilized, and who, 
<A NAME="445"></A>on the other hand, hospitable and humane. Tell us also why you are made 
<A NAME="446"></A>unhappy on hearing about the return of the Argive Danaans from Troy. The 
<A NAME="447"></A>gods arranged all this, and sent them their misfortunes in order that future 
<A NAME="448"></A>generations might have something to sing about. Did you lose some brave 
<A NAME="449"></A>kinsman of your wife's when you were before Troy? a son-in-law or father-in-law- 
<A NAME="450"></A>which are the nearest relations a man has outside his own flesh and blood? 
<A NAME="451"></A>or was it some brave and kindly-natured comrade- for a good friend is as 
<A NAME="452"></A>dear to a man as his own brother?"
