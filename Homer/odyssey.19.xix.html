<A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A>Ulysses was left in the cloister, pondering on the means whereby with Minerva's 
<A NAME="11"></A>help he might be able to kill the suitors. Presently he said to Telemachus, 
<A NAME="12"></A>"Telemachus, we must get the armour together and take it down inside. Make 
<A NAME="13"></A>some excuse when the suitors ask you why you have removed it. Say that 
<A NAME="14"></A>you have taken it to be out of the way of the smoke, inasmuch as it is 
<A NAME="15"></A>no longer what it was when Ulysses went away, but has become soiled and 
<A NAME="16"></A>begrimed with soot. Add to this more particularly that you are afraid Jove 
<A NAME="17"></A>may set them on to quarrel over their wine, and that they may do each other 
<A NAME="18"></A>some harm which may disgrace both banquet and wooing, for the sight of 
<A NAME="19"></A>arms sometimes tempts people to use them."
<A NAME="20"></A><BR><BR>Telemachus approved of what his father had said, so he called nurse 
<A NAME="21"></A>Euryclea and said, "Nurse, shut the women up in their room, while I take 
<A NAME="22"></A>the armour that my father left behind him down into the store room. No 
<A NAME="23"></A>one looks after it now my father is gone, and it has got all smirched with 
<A NAME="24"></A>soot during my own boyhood. I want to take it down where the smoke cannot 
<A NAME="25"></A>reach it."
<A NAME="26"></A><BR><BR>"I wish, child," answered Euryclea, "that you would take the management 
<A NAME="27"></A>of the house into your own hands altogether, and look after all the property 
<A NAME="28"></A>yourself. But who is to go with you and light you to the store room? The 
<A NAME="29"></A>maids would have so, but you would not let them.
<A NAME="30"></A><BR><BR>"The stranger," said Telemachus, "shall show me a light; when people 
<A NAME="31"></A>eat my bread they must earn it, no matter where they come 
<A NAME="32"></A>from."
<A NAME="33"></A><BR><BR>Euryclea did as she was told, and bolted the women inside their 
<A NAME="34"></A>room. Then Ulysses and his son made all haste to take the helmets, shields, 
<A NAME="35"></A>and spears inside; and Minerva went before them with a gold lamp in her 
<A NAME="36"></A>hand that shed a soft and brilliant radiance, whereon Telemachus said, 
<A NAME="37"></A>"Father, my eyes behold a great marvel: the walls, with the rafters, crossbeams, 
<A NAME="38"></A>and the supports on which they rest are all aglow as with a flaming fire. 
<A NAME="39"></A>Surely there is some god here who has come down from 
<A NAME="40"></A>heaven."
<A NAME="41"></A><BR><BR>"Hush," answered Ulysses, "hold your peace and ask no questions, 
<A NAME="42"></A>for this is the manner of the gods. Get you to your bed, and leave me here 
<A NAME="43"></A>to talk with your mother and the maids. Your mother in her grief will ask 
<A NAME="44"></A>me all sorts of questions."
<A NAME="45"></A><BR><BR>On this Telemachus went by torch-light to the other side of the 
<A NAME="46"></A>inner court, to the room in which he always slept. There he lay in his 
<A NAME="47"></A>bed till morning, while Ulysses was left in the cloister pondering on the 
<A NAME="48"></A>means whereby with Minerva's help he might be able to kill the 
<A NAME="49"></A>suitors.
<A NAME="50"></A><BR><BR>Then Penelope came down from her room looking like Venus or Diana, 
<A NAME="51"></A>and they set her a seat inlaid with scrolls of silver and ivory near the 
<A NAME="52"></A>fire in her accustomed place. It had been made by Icmalius and had a footstool 
<A NAME="53"></A>all in one piece with the seat itself; and it was covered with a thick 
<A NAME="54"></A>fleece: on this she now sat, and the maids came from the women's room to 
<A NAME="55"></A>join her. They set about removing the tables at which the wicked suitors 
<A NAME="56"></A>had been dining, and took away the bread that was left, with the cups from 
<A NAME="57"></A>which they had drunk. They emptied the embers out of the braziers, and 
<A NAME="58"></A>heaped much wood upon them to give both light and heat; but Melantho began 
<A NAME="59"></A>to rail at Ulysses a second time and said, "Stranger, do you mean to plague 
<A NAME="60"></A>us by hanging about the house all night and spying upon the women? Be off, 
<A NAME="61"></A>you wretch, outside, and eat your supper there, or you shall be driven 
<A NAME="62"></A>out with a firebrand."
<A NAME="63"></A><BR><BR>Ulysses scowled at her and answered, "My good woman, why should 
<A NAME="64"></A>you be so angry with me? Is it because I am not clean, and my clothes are 
<A NAME="65"></A>all in rags, and because I am obliged to go begging about after the manner 
<A NAME="66"></A>of tramps and beggars generall? I too was a rich man once, and had a fine 
<A NAME="67"></A>house of my own; in those days I gave to many a tramp such as I now am, 
<A NAME="68"></A>no matter who he might be nor what he wanted. I had any number of servants, 
<A NAME="69"></A>and all the other things which people have who live well and are accounted 
<A NAME="70"></A>wealthy, but it pleased Jove to take all away from me; therefore, woman, 
<A NAME="71"></A>beware lest you too come to lose that pride and place in which you now 
<A NAME="72"></A>wanton above your fellows; have a care lest you get out of favour with 
<A NAME="73"></A>your mistress, and lest Ulysses should come home, for there is still a 
<A NAME="74"></A>chance that he may do so. Moreover, though he be dead as you think he is, 
<A NAME="75"></A>yet by Apollo's will he has left a son behind him, Telemachus, who will 
<A NAME="76"></A>note anything done amiss by the maids in the house, for he is now no longer 
<A NAME="77"></A>in his boyhood."
<A NAME="78"></A><BR><BR>Penelope heard what he was saying and scolded the maid, "Impudent 
<A NAME="79"></A>baggage, said she, "I see how abominably you are behaving, and you shall 
<A NAME="80"></A>smart for it. You knew perfectly well, for I told you myself, that I was 
<A NAME="81"></A>going to see the stranger and ask him about my husband, for whose sake 
<A NAME="82"></A>I am in such continual sorrow."
<A NAME="83"></A><BR><BR>Then she said to her head waiting woman Eurynome, "Bring a seat 
<A NAME="84"></A>with a fleece upon it, for the stranger to sit upon while he tells his 
<A NAME="85"></A>story, and listens to what I have to say. I wish to ask him some 
<A NAME="86"></A>questions."
<A NAME="87"></A><BR><BR>Eurynome brought the seat at once and set a fleece upon it, and 
<A NAME="88"></A>as soon as Ulysses had sat down Penelope began by saying, "Stranger, I 
<A NAME="89"></A>shall first ask you who and whence are you? Tell me of your town and 
<A NAME="90"></A>parents."
<A NAME="91"></A><BR><BR>"Madam;" answered Ulysses, "who on the face of the whole earth 
<A NAME="92"></A>can dare to chide with you? Your fame reaches the firmament of heaven itself; 
<A NAME="93"></A>you are like some blameless king, who upholds righteousness, as the monarch 
<A NAME="94"></A>over a great and valiant nation: the earth yields its wheat and barley, 
<A NAME="95"></A>the trees are loaded with fruit, the ewes bring forth lambs, and the sea 
<A NAME="96"></A>abounds with fish by reason of his virtues, and his people do good deeds 
<A NAME="97"></A>under him. Nevertheless, as I sit here in your house, ask me some other 
<A NAME="98"></A>question and do not seek to know my race and family, or you will recall 
<A NAME="99"></A>memories that will yet more increase my sorrow. I am full of heaviness, 
<A NAME="100"></A>but I ought not to sit weeping and wailing in another person's house, nor 
<A NAME="101"></A>is it well to be thus grieving continually. I shall have one of the servants 
<A NAME="102"></A>or even yourself complaining of me, and saying that my eyes swim with tears 
<A NAME="103"></A>because I am heavy with wine."
<A NAME="104"></A><BR><BR>Then Penelope answered, "Stranger, heaven robbed me of all beauty, 
<A NAME="105"></A>whether of face or figure, when the Argives set sail for Troy and my dear 
<A NAME="106"></A>husband with them. If he were to return and look after my affairs I should 
<A NAME="107"></A>be both more respected and should show a better presence to the world. 
<A NAME="108"></A>As it is, I am oppressed with care, and with the afflictions which heaven 
<A NAME="109"></A>has seen fit to heap upon me. The chiefs from all our islands- Dulichium, 
<A NAME="110"></A>Same, and Zacynthus, as also from Ithaca itself, are wooing me against 
<A NAME="111"></A>my will and are wasting my estate. I can therefore show no attention to 
<A NAME="112"></A>strangers, nor suppliants, nor to people who say that they are skilled 
<A NAME="113"></A>artisans, but am all the time brokenhearted about Ulysses. They want me 
<A NAME="114"></A>to marry again at once, and I have to invent stratagems in order to deceive 
<A NAME="115"></A>them. In the first place heaven put it in my mind to set up a great tambour-frame 
<A NAME="116"></A>in my room, and to begin working upon an enormous piece of fine needlework. 
<A NAME="117"></A>Then I said to them, 'Sweethearts, Ulysses is indeed dead, still, do not 
<A NAME="118"></A>press me to marry again immediately; wait- for I would not have my skill 
<A NAME="119"></A>in needlework perish unrecorded- till I have finished making a pall for 
<A NAME="120"></A>the hero Laertes, to be ready against the time when death shall take him. 
<A NAME="121"></A>He is very rich, and the women of the place will talk if he is laid out 
<A NAME="122"></A>without a pall.' This was what I said, and they assented; whereon I used 
<A NAME="123"></A>to keep working at my great web all day long, but at night I would unpick 
<A NAME="124"></A>the stitches again by torch light. I fooled them in this way for three 
<A NAME="125"></A>years without their finding it out, but as time wore on and I was now in 
<A NAME="126"></A>my fourth year, in the waning of moons, and many days had been accomplished, 
<A NAME="127"></A>those good-for-nothing hussies my maids betrayed me to the suitors, who 
<A NAME="128"></A>broke in upon me and caught me; they were very angry with me, so I was 
<A NAME="129"></A>forced to finish my work whether I would or no. And now I do not see how 
<A NAME="130"></A>I can find any further shift for getting out of this marriage. My parents 
<A NAME="131"></A>are putting great pressure upon me, and my son chafes at the ravages the 
<A NAME="132"></A>suitors are making upon his estate, for he is now old enough to understand 
<A NAME="133"></A>all about it and is perfectly able to look after his own affairs, for heaven 
<A NAME="134"></A>has blessed him with an excellent disposition. Still, notwithstanding all 
<A NAME="135"></A>this, tell me who you are and where you come from- for you must have had 
<A NAME="136"></A>father and mother of some sort; you cannot be the son of an oak or of a 
<A NAME="137"></A>rock."
<A NAME="138"></A><BR><BR>Then Ulysses answered, "madam, wife of Ulysses, since you persist 
<A NAME="139"></A>in asking me about my family, I will answer, no matter what it costs me: 
<A NAME="140"></A>people must expect to be pained when they have been exiles as long as I 
<A NAME="141"></A>have, and suffered as much among as many peoples. Nevertheless, as regards 
<A NAME="142"></A>your question I will tell you all you ask. There is a fair and fruitful 
<A NAME="143"></A>island in mid-ocean called Crete; it is thickly peopled and there are nine 
<A NAME="144"></A>cities in it: the people speak many different languages which overlap one 
<A NAME="145"></A>another, for there are Achaeans, brave Eteocretans, Dorians of three-fold 
<A NAME="146"></A>race, and noble Pelasgi. There is a great town there, Cnossus, where Minos 
<A NAME="147"></A>reigned who every nine years had a conference with Jove himself. Minos 
<A NAME="148"></A>was father to Deucalion, whose son I am, for Deucalion had two sons Idomeneus 
<A NAME="149"></A>and myself. Idomeneus sailed for Troy, and I, who am the younger, am called 
<A NAME="150"></A>Aethon; my brother, however, was at once the older and the more valiant 
<A NAME="151"></A>of the two; hence it was in Crete that I saw Ulysses and showed him hospitality, 
<A NAME="152"></A>for the winds took him there as he was on his way to Troy, carrying him 
<A NAME="153"></A>out of his course from cape Malea and leaving him in Amnisus off the cave 
<A NAME="154"></A>of Ilithuia, where the harbours are difficult to enter and he could hardly 
<A NAME="155"></A>find shelter from the winds that were then xaging. As soon as he got there 
<A NAME="156"></A>he went into the town and asked for Idomeneus, claiming to be his old and 
<A NAME="157"></A>valued friend, but Idomeneus had already set sail for Troy some ten or 
<A NAME="158"></A>twelve days earlier, so I took him to my own house and showed him every 
<A NAME="159"></A>kind of hospitality, for I had abundance of everything. Moreover, I fed 
<A NAME="160"></A>the men who were with him with barley meal from the public store, and got 
<A NAME="161"></A>subscriptions of wine and oxen for them to sacrifice to their heart's content. 
<A NAME="162"></A>They stayed with me twelve days, for there was a gale blowing from the 
<A NAME="163"></A>North so strong that one could hardly keep one's feet on land. I suppose 
<A NAME="164"></A>some unfriendly god had raised it for them, but on the thirteenth day the 
<A NAME="165"></A>wind dropped, and they got away."
<A NAME="166"></A><BR><BR>Many a plausible tale did Ulysses further tell her, and Penelope 
<A NAME="167"></A>wept as she listened, for her heart was melted. As the snow wastes upon 
<A NAME="168"></A>the mountain tops when the winds from South East and West have breathed 
<A NAME="169"></A>upon it and thawed it till the rivers run bank full with water, even so 
<A NAME="170"></A>did her cheeks overflow with tears for the husband who was all the time 
<A NAME="171"></A>sitting by her side. Ulysses felt for her and was for her, but he kept 
<A NAME="172"></A>his eyes as hard as or iron without letting them so much as quiver, so 
<A NAME="173"></A>cunningly did he restrain his tears. Then, when she had relieved herself 
<A NAME="174"></A>by weeping, she turned to him again and said: "Now, stranger, I shall put 
<A NAME="175"></A>you to the test and see whether or no you really did entertain my husband 
<A NAME="176"></A>and his men, as you say you did. Tell me, then, how he was dressed, what 
<A NAME="177"></A>kind of a man he was to look at, and so also with his 
<A NAME="178"></A>companions."
<A NAME="179"></A><BR><BR>"Madam," answered Ulysses, "it is such a long time ago that I can 
<A NAME="180"></A>hardly say. Twenty years are come and gone since he left my home, and went 
<A NAME="181"></A>elsewhither; but I will tell you as well as I can recollect. Ulysses wore 
<A NAME="182"></A>a mantle of purple wool, double lined, and it was fastened by a gold brooch 
<A NAME="183"></A>with two catches for the pin. On the face of this there was a device that 
<A NAME="184"></A>showed a dog holding a spotted fawn between his fore paws, and watching 
<A NAME="185"></A>it as it lay panting upon the ground. Every one marvelled at the way in 
<A NAME="186"></A>which these things had been done in gold, the dog looking at the fawn, 
<A NAME="187"></A>and strangling it, while the fawn was struggling convulsively to escape. 
<A NAME="188"></A>As for the shirt that he wore next his skin, it was so soft that it fitted 
<A NAME="189"></A>him like the skin of an onion, and glistened in the sunlight to the admiration 
<A NAME="190"></A>of all the women who beheld it. Furthermore I say, and lay my saying to 
<A NAME="191"></A>your heart, that I do not know whether Ulysses wore these clothes when 
<A NAME="192"></A>he left home, or whether one of his companions had given them to him while 
<A NAME="193"></A>he was on his voyage; or possibly some one at whose house he was staying 
<A NAME="194"></A>made him a present of them, for he was a man of many friends and had few 
<A NAME="195"></A>equals among the Achaeans. I myself gave him a sword of bronze and a beautiful 
<A NAME="196"></A>purple mantle, double lined, with a shirt that went down to his feet, and 
<A NAME="197"></A>I sent him on board his ship with every mark of honour. He had a servant 
<A NAME="198"></A>with him, a little older than himself, and I can tell you what he was like; 
<A NAME="199"></A>his shoulders were hunched, he was dark, and he had thick curly hair. His 
<A NAME="200"></A>name was Eurybates, and Ulysses treated him with greater familiarity than 
<A NAME="201"></A>he did any of the others, as being the most like-minded with 
<A NAME="202"></A>himself."
<A NAME="203"></A><BR><BR>Penelope was moved still more deeply as she heard the indisputable 
<A NAME="204"></A>proofs that Ulysses laid before her; and when she had again found relief 
<A NAME="205"></A>in tears she said to him, "Stranger, I was already disposed to pity you, 
<A NAME="206"></A>but henceforth you shall be honoured and made welcome in my house. It was 
<A NAME="207"></A>I who gave Ulysses the clothes you speak of. I took them out of the store 
<A NAME="208"></A>room and folded them up myself, and I gave him also the gold brooch to 
<A NAME="209"></A>wear as an ornament. Alas! I shall never welcome him home again. It was 
<A NAME="210"></A>by an ill fate that he ever set out for that detested city whose very name 
<A NAME="211"></A>I cannot bring myself even to mention."
<A NAME="212"></A><BR><BR>Then Ulysses answered, "Madam, wife of Ulysses, do not disfigure 
<A NAME="213"></A>yourself further by grieving thus bitterly for your loss, though I can 
<A NAME="214"></A>hardly blame you for doing so. A woman who has loved her husband and borne 
<A NAME="215"></A>him children, would naturally be grieved at losing him, even though he 
<A NAME="216"></A>were a worse man than Ulysses, who they say was like a god. Still, cease 
<A NAME="217"></A>your tears and listen to what I can tell I will hide nothing from you, 
<A NAME="218"></A>and can say with perfect truth that I have lately heard of Ulysses as being 
<A NAME="219"></A>alive and on his way home; he is among the Thesprotians, and is bringing 
<A NAME="220"></A>back much valuable treasure that he has begged from one and another of 
<A NAME="221"></A>them; but his ship and all his crew were lost as they were leaving the 
<A NAME="222"></A>Thrinacian island, for Jove and the sun-god were angry with him because 
<A NAME="223"></A>his men had slaughtered the sun-god's cattle, and they were all drowned 
<A NAME="224"></A>to a man. But Ulysses stuck to the keel of the ship and was drifted on 
<A NAME="225"></A>to the land of the Phaecians, who are near of kin to the immortals, and 
<A NAME="226"></A>who treated him as though he had been a god, giving him many presents, 
<A NAME="227"></A>and wishing to escort him home safe and sound. In fact Ulysses would have 
<A NAME="228"></A>been here long ago, had he not thought better to go from land to land gathering 
<A NAME="229"></A>wealth; for there is no man living who is so wily as he is; there is no 
<A NAME="230"></A>one can compare with him. Pheidon king of the Thesprotians told me all 
<A NAME="231"></A>this, and he swore to me- making drink-offerings in his house as he did 
<A NAME="232"></A>so- that the ship was by the water side and the crew found who would take 
<A NAME="233"></A>Ulysses to his own country. He sent me off first, for there happened to 
<A NAME="234"></A>be a Thesprotian ship sailing for the wheat-growing island of Dulichium, 
<A NAME="235"></A>but he showed me all treasure Ulysses had got together, and he had enough 
<A NAME="236"></A>lying in the house of king Pheidon to keep his family for ten generations; 
<A NAME="237"></A>but the king said Ulysses had gone to Dodona that he might learn Jove's 
<A NAME="238"></A>mind from the high oak tree, and know whether after so long an absence 
<A NAME="239"></A>he should return to Ithaca openly or in secret. So you may know he is safe 
<A NAME="240"></A>and will be here shortly; he is close at hand and cannot remain away from 
<A NAME="241"></A>home much longer; nevertheless I will confirm my words with an oath, and 
<A NAME="242"></A>call Jove who is the first and mightiest of all gods to witness, as also 
<A NAME="243"></A>that hearth of Ulysses to which I have now come, that all I have spoken 
<A NAME="244"></A>shall surely come to pass. Ulysses will return in this self same year; 
<A NAME="245"></A>with the end of this moon and the beginning of the next he will be 
<A NAME="246"></A>here."
<A NAME="247"></A><BR><BR>"May it be even so," answered Penelope; "if your words come true 
<A NAME="248"></A>you shall have such gifts and such good will from me that all who see you 
<A NAME="249"></A>shall congratulate you; but I know very well how it will be. Ulysses will 
<A NAME="250"></A>not return, neither will you get your escort hence, for so surely as that 
<A NAME="251"></A>Ulysses ever was, there are now no longer any such masters in the house 
<A NAME="252"></A>as he was, to receive honourable strangers or to further them on their 
<A NAME="253"></A>way home. And now, you maids, wash his feet for him, and make him a bed 
<A NAME="254"></A>on a couch with rugs and blankets, that he may be warm and quiet till morning. 
<A NAME="255"></A>Then, at day break wash him and anoint him again, that he may sit in the 
<A NAME="256"></A>cloister and take his meals with Telemachus. It shall be the worse for 
<A NAME="257"></A>any one of these hateful people who is uncivil to him; like it or not, 
<A NAME="258"></A>he shall have no more to do in this house. For how, sir, shall you be able 
<A NAME="259"></A>to learn whether or no I am superior to others of my sex both in goodness 
<A NAME="260"></A>of heart and understanding, if I let you dine in my cloisters squalid and 
<A NAME="261"></A>ill clad? Men live but for a little season; if they are hard, and deal 
<A NAME="262"></A>hardly, people wish them ill so long as they are alive, and speak contemptuously 
<A NAME="263"></A>of them when they are dead, but he that is righteous and deals righteously, 
<A NAME="264"></A>the people tell of his praise among all lands, and many shall call him 
<A NAME="265"></A>blessed."
<A NAME="266"></A><BR><BR>Ulysses answered, "Madam, I have foresworn rugs and blankets from 
<A NAME="267"></A>the day that I left the snowy ranges of Crete to go on shipboard. I will 
<A NAME="268"></A>lie as I have lain on many a sleepless night hitherto. Night after night 
<A NAME="269"></A>have I passed in any rough sleeping place, and waited for morning. Nor, 
<A NAME="270"></A>again, do I like having my feet washed; I shall not let any of the young 
<A NAME="271"></A>hussies about your house touch my feet; but, if you have any old and respectable 
<A NAME="272"></A>woman who has gone through as much trouble as I have, I will allow her 
<A NAME="273"></A>to wash them."
<A NAME="274"></A><BR><BR>To this Penelope said, "My dear sir, of all the guests who ever 
<A NAME="275"></A>yet came to my house there never was one who spoke in all things with such 
<A NAME="276"></A>admirable propriety as you do. There happens to be in the house a most 
<A NAME="277"></A>respectable old woman- the same who received my poor dear husband in her 
<A NAME="278"></A>arms the night he was born, and nursed him in infancy. She is very feeble 
<A NAME="279"></A>now, but she shall wash your feet." "Come here," said she, "Euryclea, and 
<A NAME="280"></A>wash your master's age-mate; I suppose Ulysses' hands and feet are very 
<A NAME="281"></A>much the same now as his are, for trouble ages all of us dreadfully 
<A NAME="282"></A>fast."
<A NAME="283"></A><BR><BR>On these words the old woman covered her face with her hands; she 
<A NAME="284"></A>began to weep and made lamentation saying, "My dear child, I cannot think 
<A NAME="285"></A>whatever I am to do with you. I am certain no one was ever more god-fearing 
<A NAME="286"></A>than yourself, and yet Jove hates you. No one in the whole world ever burned 
<A NAME="287"></A>him more thigh bones, nor gave him finer hecatombs when you prayed you 
<A NAME="288"></A>might come to a green old age yourself and see your son grow up to take 
<A NAME="289"></A>after you; yet see how he has prevented you alone from ever getting back 
<A NAME="290"></A>to your own home. I have no doubt the women in some foreign palace which 
<A NAME="291"></A>Ulysses has got to are gibing at him as all these sluts here have been 
<A NAME="292"></A>gibing you. I do not wonder at your not choosing to let them wash you after 
<A NAME="293"></A>the manner in which they have insulted you; I will wash your feet myself 
<A NAME="294"></A>gladly enough, as Penelope has said that I am to do so; I will wash them 
<A NAME="295"></A>both for Penelope's sake and for your own, for you have raised the most 
<A NAME="296"></A>lively feelings of compassion in my mind; and let me say this moreover, 
<A NAME="297"></A>which pray attend to; we have had all kinds of strangers in distress come 
<A NAME="298"></A>here before now, but I make bold to say that no one ever yet came who was 
<A NAME="299"></A>so like Ulysses in figure, voice, and feet as you are."
<A NAME="300"></A><BR><BR>"Those who have seen us both," answered Ulysses, "have always said 
<A NAME="301"></A>we were wonderfully like each other, and now you have noticed it 
<A NAME="302"></A>too.
<A NAME="303"></A><BR><BR>Then the old woman took the cauldron in which she was going to 
<A NAME="304"></A>wash his feet, and poured plenty of cold water into it, adding hot till 
<A NAME="305"></A>the bath was warm enough. Ulysses sat by the fire, but ere long he turned 
<A NAME="306"></A>away from the light, for it occurred to him that when the old woman had 
<A NAME="307"></A>hold of his leg she would recognize a certain scar which it bore, whereon 
<A NAME="308"></A>the whole truth would come out. And indeed as soon as she began washing 
<A NAME="309"></A>her master, she at once knew the scar as one that had been given him by 
<A NAME="310"></A>a wild boar when he was hunting on Mount Parnassus with his excellent grandfather 
<A NAME="311"></A>Autolycus- who was the most accomplished thief and perjurer in the whole 
<A NAME="312"></A>world- and with the sons of Autolycus. Mercury himself had endowed him 
<A NAME="313"></A>with this gift, for he used to burn the thigh bones of goats and kids to 
<A NAME="314"></A>him, so he took pleasure in his companionship. It happened once that Autolycus 
<A NAME="315"></A>had gone to Ithaca and had found the child of his daughter just born. As 
<A NAME="316"></A>soon as he had done supper Euryclea set the infant upon his knees and said, 
<A NAME="317"></A>you must find a name for your grandson; you greatly wished that you might 
<A NAME="318"></A>have one."
<A NAME="319"></A><BR><BR>'Son-in-law and daughter," replied Autolycus, "call the child thus: 
<A NAME="320"></A>I am highly displeased with a large number of people in one place and another, 
<A NAME="321"></A>both men and women; so name the child 'Ulysses,' or the child of anger. 
<A NAME="322"></A>When he grows up and comes to visit his mother's family on Mount Parnassus, 
<A NAME="323"></A>where my possessions lie, I will make him a present and will send him on 
<A NAME="324"></A>his way rejoicing."
<A NAME="325"></A><BR><BR>Ulysses, therefore, went to Parnassus to get the presents from 
<A NAME="326"></A>Autolycus, who with his sons shook hands with him and gave him welcome. 
<A NAME="327"></A>His grandmother Amphithea threw her arms about him, and kissed his head, 
<A NAME="328"></A>and both his beautiful eyes, while Autolycus desired his sons to get dinner 
<A NAME="329"></A>ready, and they did as he told them. They brought in a five year old bull, 
<A NAME="330"></A>flayed it, made it ready and divided it into joints; these they then cut 
<A NAME="331"></A>carefully up into smaller pieces and spitted them; they roasted them sufficiently 
<A NAME="332"></A>and served the portions round. Thus through the livelong day to the going 
<A NAME="333"></A>down of the sun they feasted, and every man had his full share so that 
<A NAME="334"></A>all were satisfied; but when the sun set and it came on dark, they went 
<A NAME="335"></A>to bed and enjoyed the boon of sleep.
<A NAME="336"></A><BR><BR>When the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, the sons 
<A NAME="337"></A>of Autolycus went out with their hounds hunting, and Ulysses went too. 
<A NAME="338"></A>They climbed the wooded slopes of Parnassus and soon reached its breezy 
<A NAME="339"></A>upland valleys; but as the sun was beginning to beat upon the fields, fresh-risen 
<A NAME="340"></A>from the slow still currents of Oceanus, they came to a mountain dell. 
<A NAME="341"></A>The dogs were in front searching for the tracks of the beast they were 
<A NAME="342"></A>chasing, and after them came the sons of Autolycus, among whom was Ulysses, 
<A NAME="343"></A>close behind the dogs, and he had a long spear in his hand. Here was the 
<A NAME="344"></A>lair of a huge boar among some thick brushwood, so dense that the wind 
<A NAME="345"></A>and rain could not get through it, nor could the sun's rays pierce it, 
<A NAME="346"></A>and the ground underneath lay thick with fallen leaves. The boar heard 
<A NAME="347"></A>the noise of the men's feet, and the hounds baying on every side as the 
<A NAME="348"></A>huntsmen came up to him, so rushed from his lair, raised the bristles on 
<A NAME="349"></A>his neck, and stood at bay with fire flashing from his eyes. Ulysses was 
<A NAME="350"></A>the first to raise his spear and try to drive it into the brute, but the 
<A NAME="351"></A>boar was too quick for him, and charged him sideways, ripping him above 
<A NAME="352"></A>the knee with a gash that tore deep though it did not reach the bone. As 
<A NAME="353"></A>for the boar, Ulysses hit him on the right shoulder, and the point of the 
<A NAME="354"></A>spear went right through him, so that he fell groaning in the dust until 
<A NAME="355"></A>the life went out of him. The sons of Autolycus busied themselves with 
<A NAME="356"></A>the carcass of the boar, and bound Ulysses' wound; then, after saying a 
<A NAME="357"></A>spell to stop the bleeding, they went home as fast as they could. But when 
<A NAME="358"></A>Autolycus and his sons had thoroughly healed Ulysses, they made him some 
<A NAME="359"></A>splendid presents, and sent him back to Ithaca with much mutual good will. 
<A NAME="360"></A>When he got back, his father and mother were rejoiced to see him, and asked 
<A NAME="361"></A>him all about it, and how he had hurt himself to get the scar; so he told 
<A NAME="362"></A>them how the boar had ripped him when he was out hunting with Autolycus 
<A NAME="363"></A>and his sons on Mount Parnassus.
<A NAME="364"></A><BR><BR>As soon as Euryclea had got the scarred limb in her hands and had 
<A NAME="365"></A>well hold of it, she recognized it and dropped the foot at once. The leg 
<A NAME="366"></A>fell into the bath, which rang out and was overturned, so that all the 
<A NAME="367"></A>water was spilt on the ground; Euryclea's eyes between her joy and her 
<A NAME="368"></A>grief filled with tears, and she could not speak, but she caught Ulysses 
<A NAME="369"></A>by the beard and said, "My dear child, I am sure you must be Ulysses himself, 
<A NAME="370"></A>only I did not know you till I had actually touched and handled 
<A NAME="371"></A>you."
<A NAME="372"></A><BR><BR>As she spoke she looked towards Penelope, as though wanting to 
<A NAME="373"></A>tell her that her dear husband was in the house, but Penelope was unable 
<A NAME="374"></A>to look in that direction and observe what was going on, for Minerva had 
<A NAME="375"></A>diverted her attention; so Ulysses caught Euryclea by the throat with his 
<A NAME="376"></A>right hand and with his left drew her close to him, and said, "Nurse, do 
<A NAME="377"></A>you wish to be the ruin of me, you who nursed me at your own breast, now 
<A NAME="378"></A>that after twenty years of wandering I am at last come to my own home again? 
<A NAME="379"></A>Since it has been borne in upon you by heaven to recognize me, hold your 
<A NAME="380"></A>tongue, and do not say a word about it any one else in the house, for if 
<A NAME="381"></A>you do I tell you- and it shall surely be- that if heaven grants me to 
<A NAME="382"></A>take the lives of these suitors, I will not spare you, though you are my 
<A NAME="383"></A>own nurse, when I am killing the other women."
<A NAME="384"></A><BR><BR>"My child," answered Euryclea, "what are you talking about? You 
<A NAME="385"></A>know very well that nothing can either bend or break me. I will hold my 
<A NAME="386"></A>tongue like a stone or a piece of iron; furthermore let me say, and lay 
<A NAME="387"></A>my saying to your heart, when heaven has delivered the suitors into your 
<A NAME="388"></A>hand, I will give you a list of the women in the house who have been ill-behaved, 
<A NAME="389"></A>and of those who are guiltless."
<A NAME="390"></A><BR><BR>And Ulysses answered, "Nurse, you ought not to speak in that way; 
<A NAME="391"></A>I am well able to form my own opinion about one and all of them; hold your 
<A NAME="392"></A>tongue and leave everything to heaven."
<A NAME="393"></A><BR><BR>As he said this Euryclea left the cloister to fetch some more water, 
<A NAME="394"></A>for the first had been all spilt; and when she had washed him and anointed 
<A NAME="395"></A>him with oil, Ulysses drew his seat nearer to the fire to warm himself, 
<A NAME="396"></A>and hid the scar under his rags. Then Penelope began talking to him and 
<A NAME="397"></A>said:
<A NAME="398"></A><BR><BR>"Stranger, I should like to speak with you briefly about another 
<A NAME="399"></A>matter. It is indeed nearly bed time- for those, at least, who can sleep 
<A NAME="400"></A>in spite of sorrow. As for myself, heaven has given me a life of such unmeasurable 
<A NAME="401"></A>woe, that even by day when I am attending to my duties and looking after 
<A NAME="402"></A>the servants, I am still weeping and lamenting during the whole time; then, 
<A NAME="403"></A>when night comes, and we all of us go to bed, I lie awake thinking, and 
<A NAME="404"></A>my heart comes a prey to the most incessant and cruel tortures. As the 
<A NAME="405"></A>dun nightingale, daughter of Pandareus, sings in the early spring from 
<A NAME="406"></A>her seat in shadiest covert hid, and with many a plaintive trill pours 
<A NAME="407"></A>out the tale how by mishap she killed her own child Itylus, son of king 
<A NAME="408"></A>Zethus, even so does my mind toss and turn in its uncertainty whether I 
<A NAME="409"></A>ought to stay with my son here, and safeguard my substance, my bondsmen, 
<A NAME="410"></A>and the greatness of my house, out of regard to public opinion and the 
<A NAME="411"></A>memory of my late husband, or whether it is not now time for me to go with 
<A NAME="412"></A>the best of these suitors who are wooing me and making me such magnificent 
<A NAME="413"></A>presents. As long as my son was still young, and unable to understand, 
<A NAME="414"></A>he would not hear of my leaving my husband's house, but now that he is 
<A NAME="415"></A>full grown he begs and prays me to do so, being incensed at the way in 
<A NAME="416"></A>which the suitors are eating up his property. Listen, then, to a dream 
<A NAME="417"></A>that I have had and interpret it for me if you can. I have twenty geese 
<A NAME="418"></A>about the house that eat mash out of a trough, and of which I am exceedingly 
<A NAME="419"></A>fond. I dreamed that a great eagle came swooping down from a mountain, 
<A NAME="420"></A>and dug his curved beak into the neck of each of them till he had killed 
<A NAME="421"></A>them all. Presently he soared off into the sky, and left them lying dead 
<A NAME="422"></A>about the yard; whereon I wept in my room till all my maids gathered round 
<A NAME="423"></A>me, so piteously was I grieving because the eagle had killed my geese. 
<A NAME="424"></A>Then he came back again, and perching on a projecting rafter spoke to me 
<A NAME="425"></A>with human voice, and told me to leave off crying. 'Be of good courage,' 
<A NAME="426"></A>he said, 'daughter of Icarius; this is no dream, but a vision of good omen 
<A NAME="427"></A>that shall surely come to pass. The geese are the suitors, and I am no 
<A NAME="428"></A>longer an eagle, but your own husband, who am come back to you, and who 
<A NAME="429"></A>will bring these suitors to a disgraceful end.' On this I woke, and when 
<A NAME="430"></A>I looked out I saw my geese at the trough eating their mash as 
<A NAME="431"></A>usual."
<A NAME="432"></A><BR><BR>"This dream, Madam," replied Ulysses, "can admit but of one interpretation, 
<A NAME="433"></A>for had not Ulysses himself told you how it shall be fulfilled? The death 
<A NAME="434"></A>of the suitors is portended, and not one single one of them will 
<A NAME="435"></A>escape."
<A NAME="436"></A><BR><BR>And Penelope answered, "Stranger, dreams are very curious and unaccountable 
<A NAME="437"></A>things, and they do not by any means invariably come true. There are two 
<A NAME="438"></A>gates through which these unsubstantial fancies proceed; the one is of 
<A NAME="439"></A>horn, and the other ivory. Those that come through the gate of ivory are 
<A NAME="440"></A>fatuous, but those from the gate of horn mean something to those that see 
<A NAME="441"></A>them. I do not think, however, that my own dream came through the gate 
<A NAME="442"></A>of horn, though I and my son should be most thankful if it proves to have 
<A NAME="443"></A>done so. Furthermore I say- and lay my saying to your heart- the coming 
<A NAME="444"></A>dawn will usher in the ill-omened day that is to sever me from the house 
<A NAME="445"></A>of Ulysses, for I am about to hold a tournament of axes. My husband used 
<A NAME="446"></A>to set up twelve axes in the court, one in front of the other, like the 
<A NAME="447"></A>stays upon which a ship is built; he would then go back from them and shoot 
<A NAME="448"></A>an arrow through the whole twelve. I shall make the suitors try to do the 
<A NAME="449"></A>same thing, and whichever of them can string the bow most easily, and send 
<A NAME="450"></A>his arrow through all the twelve axes, him will I follow, and quit this 
<A NAME="451"></A>house of my lawful husband, so goodly and so abounding in wealth. But even 
<A NAME="452"></A>so, I doubt not that I shall remember it in my dreams."
<A NAME="453"></A><BR><BR>Then Ulysses answered, "Madam wife of Ulysses, you need not defer 
<A NAME="454"></A>your tournament, for Ulysses will return ere ever they can string the bow, 
<A NAME="455"></A>handle it how they will, and send their arrows through the 
<A NAME="456"></A>iron."
<A NAME="457"></A><BR><BR>To this Penelope said, "As long, sir, as you will sit here and 
<A NAME="458"></A>talk to me, I can have no desire to go to bed. Still, people cannot do 
<A NAME="459"></A>permanently without sleep, and heaven has appointed us dwellers on earth 
<A NAME="460"></A>a time for all things. I will therefore go upstairs and recline upon that 
<A NAME="461"></A>couch which I have never ceased to flood with my tears from the day Ulysses 
<A NAME="462"></A>set out for the city with a hateful name."
<A NAME="463"></A><BR><BR>She then went upstairs to her own room, not alone, but attended 
<A NAME="464"></A>by her maidens, and when there, she lamented her dear husband till Minerva 
<A NAME="465"></A>shed sweet sleep over her eyelids.
