<A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A>Now when the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, Telemachus 
<A NAME="11"></A>rose and dressed himself. He bound his sandals on to his comely feet, girded 
<A NAME="12"></A>his sword about his shoulder, and left his room looking like an immortal 
<A NAME="13"></A>god. He at once sent the criers round to call the people in assembly, so 
<A NAME="14"></A>they called them and the people gathered thereon; then, when they were 
<A NAME="15"></A>got together, he went to the place of assembly spear in hand- not alone, 
<A NAME="16"></A>for his two hounds went with him. Minerva endowed him with a presence of 
<A NAME="17"></A>such divine comeliness that all marvelled at him as he went by, and when 
<A NAME="18"></A>he took his place' in his father's seat even the oldest councillors made 
<A NAME="19"></A>way for him.
<A NAME="20"></A><BR><BR>Aegyptius, a man bent double with age, and of infinite experience, 
<A NAME="21"></A>the first to speak His son Antiphus had gone with Ulysses to Ilius, land 
<A NAME="22"></A>of noble steeds, but the savage Cyclops had killed him when they were all 
<A NAME="23"></A>shut up in the cave, and had cooked his last dinner for him, He had three 
<A NAME="24"></A>sons left, of whom two still worked on their father's land, while the third, 
<A NAME="25"></A>Eurynomus, was one of the suitors; nevertheless their father could not 
<A NAME="26"></A>get over the loss of Antiphus, and was still weeping for him when he began 
<A NAME="27"></A>his speech.
<A NAME="28"></A><BR><BR>"Men of Ithaca," he said, "hear my words. From the day Ulysses 
<A NAME="29"></A>left us there has been no meeting of our councillors until now; who then 
<A NAME="30"></A>can it be, whether old or young, that finds it so necessary to convene 
<A NAME="31"></A>us? Has he got wind of some host approaching, and does he wish to warn 
<A NAME="32"></A>us, or would he speak upon some other matter of public moment? I am sure 
<A NAME="33"></A>he is an excellent person, and I hope Jove will grant him his heart's 
<A NAME="34"></A>desire."
<A NAME="35"></A><BR><BR>Telemachus took this speech as of good omen and rose at once, for 
<A NAME="36"></A>he was bursting with what he had to say. He stood in the middle of the 
<A NAME="37"></A>assembly and the good herald Pisenor brought him his staff. Then, turning 
<A NAME="38"></A>to Aegyptius, "Sir," said he, "it is I, as you will shortly learn, who 
<A NAME="39"></A>have convened you, for it is I who am the most aggrieved. I have not got 
<A NAME="40"></A>wind of any host approaching about which I would warn you, nor is there 
<A NAME="41"></A>any matter of public moment on which I would speak. My grieveance is purely 
<A NAME="42"></A>personal, and turns on two great misfortunes which have fallen upon my 
<A NAME="43"></A>house. The first of these is the loss of my excellent father, who was chief 
<A NAME="44"></A>among all you here present, and was like a father to every one of you; 
<A NAME="45"></A>the second is much more serious, and ere long will be the utter ruin of 
<A NAME="46"></A>my estate. The sons of all the chief men among you are pestering my mother 
<A NAME="47"></A>to marry them against her will. They are afraid to go to her father Icarius, 
<A NAME="48"></A>asking him to choose the one he likes best, and to provide marriage gifts 
<A NAME="49"></A>for his daughter, but day by day they keep hanging about my father's house, 
<A NAME="50"></A>sacrificing our oxen, sheep, and fat goats for their banquets, and never 
<A NAME="51"></A>giving so much as a thought to the quantity of wine they drink. No estate 
<A NAME="52"></A>can stand such recklessness; we have now no Ulysses to ward off harm from 
<A NAME="53"></A>our doors, and I cannot hold my own against them. I shall never all my 
<A NAME="54"></A>days be as good a man as he was, still I would indeed defend myself if 
<A NAME="55"></A>I had power to do so, for I cannot stand such treatment any longer; my 
<A NAME="56"></A>house is being disgraced and ruined. Have respect, therefore, to your own 
<A NAME="57"></A>consciences and to public opinion. Fear, too, the wrath of heaven, lest 
<A NAME="58"></A>the gods should be displeased and turn upon you. I pray you by Jove and 
<A NAME="59"></A>Themis, who is the beginning and the end of councils, [do not] hold back, 
<A NAME="60"></A>my friends, and leave me singlehanded- unless it be that my brave father 
<A NAME="61"></A>Ulysses did some wrong to the Achaeans which you would now avenge on me, 
<A NAME="62"></A>by aiding and abetting these suitors. Moreover, if I am to be eaten out 
<A NAME="63"></A>of house and home at all, I had rather you did the eating yourselves, for 
<A NAME="64"></A>I could then take action against you to some purpose, and serve you with 
<A NAME="65"></A>notices from house to house till I got paid in full, whereas now I have 
<A NAME="66"></A>no remedy."
<A NAME="67"></A><BR><BR>With this Telemachus dashed his staff to the ground and burst into 
<A NAME="68"></A>tears. Every one was very sorry for him, but they all sat still and no 
<A NAME="69"></A>one ventured to make him an angry answer, save only Antinous, who spoke 
<A NAME="70"></A>thus:
<A NAME="71"></A><BR><BR>"Telemachus, insolent braggart that you are, how dare you try to 
<A NAME="72"></A>throw the blame upon us suitors? It is your mother's fault not ours, for 
<A NAME="73"></A>she is a very artful woman. This three years past, and close on four, she 
<A NAME="74"></A>has been driving us out of our minds, by encouraging each one of us, and 
<A NAME="75"></A>sending him messages without meaning one word of what she says. And then 
<A NAME="76"></A>there was that other trick she played us. She set up a great tambour frame 
<A NAME="77"></A>in her room, and began to work on an enormous piece of fine needlework. 
<A NAME="78"></A>'Sweet hearts,' said she, 'Ulysses is indeed dead, still do not press me 
<A NAME="79"></A>to marry again immediately, wait- for I would not have skill in needlework 
<A NAME="80"></A>perish unrecorded- till I have completed a pall for the hero Laertes, to 
<A NAME="81"></A>be in readiness against the time when death shall take him. He is very 
<A NAME="82"></A>rich, and the women of the place will talk if he is laid out without a 
<A NAME="83"></A>pall.'
<A NAME="84"></A><BR><BR>"This was what she said, and we assented; whereon we could see 
<A NAME="85"></A>her working on her great web all day long, but at night she would unpick 
<A NAME="86"></A>the stitches again by torchlight. She fooled us in this way for three years 
<A NAME="87"></A>and we never found her out, but as time wore on and she was now in her 
<A NAME="88"></A>fourth year, one of her maids who knew what she was doing told us, and 
<A NAME="89"></A>we caught her in the act of undoing her work, so she had to finish it whether 
<A NAME="90"></A>she would or no. The suitors, therefore, make you this answer, that both 
<A NAME="91"></A>you and the Achaeans may understand-'Send your mother away, and bid her 
<A NAME="92"></A>marry the man of her own and of her father's choice'; for I do not know 
<A NAME="93"></A>what will happen if she goes on plaguing us much longer with the airs she 
<A NAME="94"></A>gives herself on the score of the accomplishments Minerva has taught her, 
<A NAME="95"></A>and because she is so clever. We never yet heard of such a woman; we know 
<A NAME="96"></A>all about Tyro, Alcmena, Mycene, and the famous women of old, but they 
<A NAME="97"></A>were nothing to your mother, any one of them. It was not fair of her to 
<A NAME="98"></A>treat us in that way, and as long as she continues in the mind with which 
<A NAME="99"></A>heaven has now endowed her, so long shall we go on eating up your estate; 
<A NAME="100"></A>and I do not see why she should change, for she gets all the honour and 
<A NAME="101"></A>glory, and it is you who pay for it, not she. Understand, then, that we 
<A NAME="102"></A>will not go back to our lands, neither here nor elsewhere, till she has 
<A NAME="103"></A>made her choice and married some one or other of us."
<A NAME="104"></A><BR><BR>Telemachus answered, "Antinous, how can I drive the mother who 
<A NAME="105"></A>bore me from my father's house? My father is abroad and we do not know 
<A NAME="106"></A>whether he is alive or dead. It will be hard on me if I have to pay Icarius 
<A NAME="107"></A>the large sum which I must give him if I insist on sending his daughter 
<A NAME="108"></A>back to him. Not only will he deal rigorously with me, but heaven will 
<A NAME="109"></A>also punish me; for my mother when she leaves the house will calf on the 
<A NAME="110"></A>Erinyes to avenge her; besides, it would not be a creditable thing to do, 
<A NAME="111"></A>and I will have nothing to say to it. If you choose to take offence at 
<A NAME="112"></A>this, leave the house and feast elsewhere at one another's houses at your 
<A NAME="113"></A>own cost turn and turn about. If, on the other hand, you elect to persist 
<A NAME="114"></A>in spunging upon one man, heaven help me, but Jove shall reckon with you 
<A NAME="115"></A>in full, and when you fall in my father's house there shall be no man to 
<A NAME="116"></A>avenge you."
<A NAME="117"></A><BR><BR>As he spoke Jove sent two eagles from the top of the mountain, 
<A NAME="118"></A>and they flew on and on with the wind, sailing side by side in their own 
<A NAME="119"></A>lordly flight. When they were right over the middle of the assembly they 
<A NAME="120"></A>wheeled and circled about, beating the air with their wings and glaring 
<A NAME="121"></A>death into the eyes of them that were below; then, fighting fiercely and 
<A NAME="122"></A>tearing at one another, they flew off towards the right over the town. 
<A NAME="123"></A>The people wondered as they saw them, and asked each other what an this 
<A NAME="124"></A>might be; whereon Halitherses, who was the best prophet and reader of omens 
<A NAME="125"></A>among them, spoke to them plainly and in all honesty, 
<A NAME="126"></A>saying:
<A NAME="127"></A><BR><BR>"Hear me, men of Ithaca, and I speak more particularly to the suitors, 
<A NAME="128"></A>for I see mischief brewing for them. Ulysses is not going to be away much 
<A NAME="129"></A>longer; indeed he is close at hand to deal out death and destruction, not 
<A NAME="130"></A>on them alone, but on many another of us who live in Ithaca. Let us then 
<A NAME="131"></A>be wise in time, and put a stop to this wickedness before he comes. Let 
<A NAME="132"></A>the suitors do so of their own accord; it will be better for them, for 
<A NAME="133"></A>I am not prophesying without due knowledge; everything has happened to 
<A NAME="134"></A>Ulysses as I foretold when the Argives set out for Troy, and he with them. 
<A NAME="135"></A>I said that after going through much hardship and losing all his men he 
<A NAME="136"></A>should come home again in the twentieth year and that no one would know 
<A NAME="137"></A>him; and now all this is coming true."
<A NAME="138"></A><BR><BR>Eurymachus son of Polybus then said, "Go home, old man, and prophesy 
<A NAME="139"></A>to your own children, or it may be worse for them. I can read these omens 
<A NAME="140"></A>myself much better than you can; birds are always flying about in the sunshine 
<A NAME="141"></A>somewhere or other, but they seldom mean anything. Ulysses has died in 
<A NAME="142"></A>a far country, and it is a pity you are not dead along with him, instead 
<A NAME="143"></A>of prating here about omens and adding fuel to the anger of Telemachus 
<A NAME="144"></A>which is fierce enough as it is. I suppose you think he will give you something 
<A NAME="145"></A>for your family, but I tell you- and it shall surely be- when an old man 
<A NAME="146"></A>like you, who should know better, talks a young one over till he becomes 
<A NAME="147"></A>troublesome, in the first place his young friend will only fare so much 
<A NAME="148"></A>the worse- he will take nothing by it, for the suitors will prevent this- 
<A NAME="149"></A>and in the next, we will lay a heavier fine, sir, upon yourself than you 
<A NAME="150"></A>will at all like paying, for it will bear hardly upon you. As for Telemachus, 
<A NAME="151"></A>I warn him in the presence of you all to send his mother back to her father, 
<A NAME="152"></A>who will find her a husband and provide her with all the marriage gifts 
<A NAME="153"></A>so dear a daughter may expect. Till we shall go on harassing him with our 
<A NAME="154"></A>suit; for we fear no man, and care neither for him, with all his fine speeches, 
<A NAME="155"></A>nor for any fortune-telling of yours. You may preach as much as you please, 
<A NAME="156"></A>but we shall only hate you the more. We shall go back and continue to eat 
<A NAME="157"></A>up Telemachus's estate without paying him, till such time as his mother 
<A NAME="158"></A>leaves off tormenting us by keeping us day after day on the tiptoe of expectation, 
<A NAME="159"></A>each vying with the other in his suit for a prize of such rare perfection. 
<A NAME="160"></A>Besides we cannot go after the other women whom we should marry in due 
<A NAME="161"></A>course, but for the way in which she treats us."
<A NAME="162"></A><BR><BR>Then Telemachus said, "Eurymachus, and you other suitors, I shall 
<A NAME="163"></A>say no more, and entreat you no further, for the gods and the people of 
<A NAME="164"></A>Ithaca now know my story. Give me, then, a ship and a crew of twenty men 
<A NAME="165"></A>to take me hither and thither, and I will go to Sparta and to Pylos in 
<A NAME="166"></A>quest of my father who has so long been missing. Some one may tell me something, 
<A NAME="167"></A>or (and people often hear things in this way) some heaven-sent message 
<A NAME="168"></A>may direct me. If I can hear of him as alive and on his way home I will 
<A NAME="169"></A>put up with the waste you suitors will make for yet another twelve months. 
<A NAME="170"></A>If on the other hand I hear of his death, I will return at once, celebrate 
<A NAME="171"></A>his funeral rites with all due pomp, build a barrow to his memory, and 
<A NAME="172"></A>make my mother marry again."
<A NAME="173"></A><BR><BR>With these words he sat down, and Mentor who had been a friend 
<A NAME="174"></A>of Ulysses, and had been left in charge of everything with full authority 
<A NAME="175"></A>over the servants, rose to speak. He, then, plainly and in all honesty 
<A NAME="176"></A>addressed them thus:
<A NAME="177"></A><BR><BR>"Hear me, men of Ithaca, I hope that you may never have a kind 
<A NAME="178"></A>and well-disposed ruler any more, nor one who will govern you equitably; 
<A NAME="179"></A>I hope that all your chiefs henceforward may be cruel and unjust, for there 
<A NAME="180"></A>is not one of you but has forgotten Ulysses, who ruled you as though he 
<A NAME="181"></A>were your father. I am not half so angry with the suitors, for if they 
<A NAME="182"></A>choose to do violence in the naughtiness of their hearts, and wager their 
<A NAME="183"></A>heads that Ulysses will not return, they can take the high hand and eat 
<A NAME="184"></A>up his estate, but as for you others I am shocked at the way in which you 
<A NAME="185"></A>all sit still without even trying to stop such scandalous goings on-which 
<A NAME="186"></A>you could do if you chose, for you are many and they are 
<A NAME="187"></A>few."
<A NAME="188"></A><BR><BR>Leiocritus, son of Evenor, answered him saying, "Mentor, what folly 
<A NAME="189"></A>is all this, that you should set the people to stay us? It is a hard thing 
<A NAME="190"></A>for one man to fight with many about his victuals. Even though Ulysses 
<A NAME="191"></A>himself were to set upon us while we are feasting in his house, and do 
<A NAME="192"></A>his best to oust us, his wife, who wants him back so very badly, would 
<A NAME="193"></A>have small cause for rejoicing, and his blood would be upon his own head 
<A NAME="194"></A>if he fought against such great odds. There is no sense in what you have 
<A NAME="195"></A>been saying. Now, therefore, do you people go about your business, and 
<A NAME="196"></A>let his father's old friends, Mentor and Halitherses, speed this boy on 
<A NAME="197"></A>his journey, if he goes at all- which I do not think he will, for he is 
<A NAME="198"></A>more likely to stay where he is till some one comes and tells him 
<A NAME="199"></A>something."
<A NAME="200"></A><BR><BR>On this he broke up the assembly, and every man went back to his 
<A NAME="201"></A>own abode, while the suitors returned to the house of 
<A NAME="202"></A>Ulysses.
<A NAME="203"></A><BR><BR>Then Telemachus went all alone by the sea side, washed his hands 
<A NAME="204"></A>in the grey waves, and prayed to Minerva.
<A NAME="205"></A><BR><BR>"Hear me," he cried, "you god who visited me yesterday, and bade 
<A NAME="206"></A>me sail the seas in search of my father who has so long been missing. I 
<A NAME="207"></A>would obey you, but the Achaeans, and more particularly the wicked suitors, 
<A NAME="208"></A>are hindering me that I cannot do so."
<A NAME="209"></A><BR><BR>As he thus prayed, Minerva came close up to him in the likeness 
<A NAME="210"></A>and with the voice of Mentor. "Telemachus," said she, "if you are made 
<A NAME="211"></A>of the same stuff as your father you will be neither fool nor coward henceforward, 
<A NAME="212"></A>for Ulysses never broke his word nor left his work half done. If, then, 
<A NAME="213"></A>you take after him, your voyage will not be fruitless, but unless you have 
<A NAME="214"></A>the blood of Ulysses and of Penelope in your veins I see no likelihood 
<A NAME="215"></A>of your succeeding. Sons are seldom as good men as their fathers; they 
<A NAME="216"></A>are generally worse, not better; still, as you are not going to be either 
<A NAME="217"></A>fool or coward henceforward, and are not entirely without some share of 
<A NAME="218"></A>your father's wise discernment, I look with hope upon your undertaking. 
<A NAME="219"></A>But mind you never make common cause with any of those foolish suitors, 
<A NAME="220"></A>for they have neither sense nor virtue, and give no thought to death and 
<A NAME="221"></A>to the doom that will shortly fall on one and all of them, so that they 
<A NAME="222"></A>shall perish on the same day. As for your voyage, it shall not be long 
<A NAME="223"></A>delayed; your father was such an old friend of mine that I will find you 
<A NAME="224"></A>a ship, and will come with you myself. Now, however, return home, and go 
<A NAME="225"></A>about among the suitors; begin getting provisions ready for your voyage; 
<A NAME="226"></A>see everything well stowed, the wine in jars, and the barley meal, which 
<A NAME="227"></A>is the staff of life, in leathern bags, while I go round the town and beat 
<A NAME="228"></A>up volunteers at once. There are many ships in Ithaca both old and new; 
<A NAME="229"></A>I will run my eye over them for you and will choose the best; we will get 
<A NAME="230"></A>her ready and will put out to sea without delay."
<A NAME="231"></A><BR><BR>Thus spoke Minerva daughter of Jove, and Telemachus lost no time 
<A NAME="232"></A>in doing as the goddess told him. He went moodily and found the suitors 
<A NAME="233"></A>flaying goats and singeing pigs in the outer court. Antinous came up to 
<A NAME="234"></A>him at once and laughed as he took his hand in his own, saying, "Telemachus, 
<A NAME="235"></A>my fine fire-eater, bear no more ill blood neither in word nor deed, but 
<A NAME="236"></A>eat and drink with us as you used to do. The Achaeans will find you in 
<A NAME="237"></A>everything- a ship and a picked crew to boot- so that you can set sail 
<A NAME="238"></A>for Pylos at once and get news of your noble father."
<A NAME="239"></A><BR><BR>"Antinous," answered Telemachus, "I cannot eat in peace, nor take 
<A NAME="240"></A>pleasure of any kind with such men as you are. Was it not enough that you 
<A NAME="241"></A>should waste so much good property of mine while I was yet a boy? Now that 
<A NAME="242"></A>I am older and know more about it, I am also stronger, and whether here 
<A NAME="243"></A>among this people, or by going to Pylos, I will do you all the harm I can. 
<A NAME="244"></A>I shall go, and my going will not be in vain though, thanks to you suitors, 
<A NAME="245"></A>I have neither ship nor crew of my own, and must be passenger not 
<A NAME="246"></A>captain."
<A NAME="247"></A><BR><BR>As he spoke he snatched his hand from that of Antinous. Meanwhile 
<A NAME="248"></A>the others went on getting dinner ready about the buildings, jeering at 
<A NAME="249"></A>him tauntingly as they did so.
<A NAME="250"></A><BR><BR>"Telemachus," said one youngster, "means to be the death of us; 
<A NAME="251"></A>I suppose he thinks he can bring friends to help him from Pylos, or again 
<A NAME="252"></A>from Sparta, where he seems bent on going. Or will he go to Ephyra as well, 
<A NAME="253"></A>for poison to put in our wine and kill us?"
<A NAME="254"></A><BR><BR>Another said, "Perhaps if Telemachus goes on board ship, he will 
<A NAME="255"></A>be like his father and perish far from his friends. In this case we should 
<A NAME="256"></A>have plenty to do, for we could then divide up his property amongst us: 
<A NAME="257"></A>as for the house we can let his mother and the man who marries her have 
<A NAME="258"></A>that."
<A NAME="259"></A><BR><BR>This was how they talked. But Telemachus went down into the lofty 
<A NAME="260"></A>and spacious store-room where his father's treasure of gold and bronze 
<A NAME="261"></A>lay heaped up upon the floor, and where the linen and spare clothes were 
<A NAME="262"></A>kept in open chests. Here, too, there was a store of fragrant olive oil, 
<A NAME="263"></A>while casks of old, well-ripened wine, unblended and fit for a god to drink, 
<A NAME="264"></A>were ranged against the wall in case Ulysses should come home again after 
<A NAME="265"></A>all. The room was closed with well-made doors opening in the middle; moreover 
<A NAME="266"></A>the faithful old house-keeper Euryclea, daughter of Ops the son of Pisenor, 
<A NAME="267"></A>was in charge of everything both night and day. Telemachus called her to 
<A NAME="268"></A>the store-room and said:
<A NAME="269"></A><BR><BR>"Nurse, draw me off some of the best wine you have, after what 
<A NAME="270"></A>you are keeping for my father's own drinking, in case, poor man, he should 
<A NAME="271"></A>escape death, and find his way home again after all. Let me have twelve 
<A NAME="272"></A>jars, and see that they all have lids; also fill me some well-sewn leathern 
<A NAME="273"></A>bags with barley meal- about twenty measures in all. Get these things put 
<A NAME="274"></A>together at once, and say nothing about it. I will take everything away 
<A NAME="275"></A>this evening as soon as my mother has gone upstairs for the night. I am 
<A NAME="276"></A>going to Sparta and to Pylos to see if I can hear anything about the return 
<A NAME="277"></A>of my dear father.
<A NAME="278"></A><BR><BR>When Euryclea heard this she began to cry, and spoke fondly to 
<A NAME="279"></A>him, saying, "My dear child, what ever can have put such notion as that 
<A NAME="280"></A>into your head? Where in the world do you want to go to- you, who are the 
<A NAME="281"></A>one hope of the house? Your poor father is dead and gone in some foreign 
<A NAME="282"></A>country nobody knows where, and as soon as your back is turned these wicked 
<A NAME="283"></A>ones here will be scheming to get you put out of the way, and will share 
<A NAME="284"></A>all your possessions among themselves; stay where you are among your own 
<A NAME="285"></A>people, and do not go wandering and worrying your life out on the barren 
<A NAME="286"></A>ocean."
<A NAME="287"></A><BR><BR>"Fear not, nurse," answered Telemachus, "my scheme is not without 
<A NAME="288"></A>heaven's sanction; but swear that you will say nothing about all this to 
<A NAME="289"></A>my mother, till I have been away some ten or twelve days, unless she hears 
<A NAME="290"></A>of my having gone, and asks you; for I do not want her to spoil her beauty 
<A NAME="291"></A>by crying."
<A NAME="292"></A><BR><BR>The old woman swore most solemnly that she would not, and when 
<A NAME="293"></A>she had completed her oath, she began drawing off the wine into jars, and 
<A NAME="294"></A>getting the barley meal into the bags, while Telemachus went back to the 
<A NAME="295"></A>suitors.
<A NAME="296"></A><BR><BR>Then Minerva bethought her of another matter. She took his shape, 
<A NAME="297"></A>and went round the town to each one of the crew, telling them to meet at 
<A NAME="298"></A>the ship by sundown. She went also to Noemon son of Phronius, and asked 
<A NAME="299"></A>him to let her have a ship- which he was very ready to do. When the sun 
<A NAME="300"></A>had set and darkness was over all the land, she got the ship into the water, 
<A NAME="301"></A>put all the tackle on board her that ships generally carry, and stationed 
<A NAME="302"></A>her at the end of the harbour. Presently the crew came up, and the goddess 
<A NAME="303"></A>spoke encouragingly to each of them.
<A NAME="304"></A><BR><BR>Furthermore she went to the house of Ulysses, and threw the suitors 
<A NAME="305"></A>into a deep slumber. She caused their drink to fuddle them, and made them 
<A NAME="306"></A>drop their cups from their hands, so that instead of sitting over their 
<A NAME="307"></A>wine, they went back into the town to sleep, with their eyes heavy and 
<A NAME="308"></A>full of drowsiness. Then she took the form and voice of Mentor, and called 
<A NAME="309"></A>Telemachus to come outside.
<A NAME="310"></A><BR><BR>"Telemachus," said she, "the men are on board and at their oars, 
<A NAME="311"></A>waiting for you to give your orders, so make haste and let us be 
<A NAME="312"></A>off."
<A NAME="313"></A><BR><BR>On this she led the way, while Telemachus followed in her steps. 
<A NAME="314"></A>When they got to the ship they found the crew waiting by the water side, 
<A NAME="315"></A>and Telemachus said, "Now my men, help me to get the stores on board; they 
<A NAME="316"></A>are all put together in the cloister, and my mother does not know anything 
<A NAME="317"></A>about it, nor any of the maid servants except one."
<A NAME="318"></A><BR><BR>With these words he led the way and the others followed after. 
<A NAME="319"></A>When they had brought the things as he told them, Telemachus went on board, 
<A NAME="320"></A>Minerva going before him and taking her seat in the stern of the vessel, 
<A NAME="321"></A>while Telemachus sat beside her. Then the men loosed the hawsers and took 
<A NAME="322"></A>their places on the benches. Minerva sent them a fair wind from the West, 
<A NAME="323"></A>that whistled over the deep blue waves whereon Telemachus told them to 
<A NAME="324"></A>catch hold of the ropes and hoist sail, and they did as he told them. They 
<A NAME="325"></A>set the mast in its socket in the cross plank, raised it, and made it fast 
<A NAME="326"></A>with the forestays; then they hoisted their white sails aloft with ropes 
<A NAME="327"></A>of twisted ox hide. As the sail bellied out with the wind, the ship flew 
<A NAME="328"></A>through the deep blue water, and the foam hissed against her bows as she 
<A NAME="329"></A>sped onward. Then they made all fast throughout the ship, filled the mixing-bowls 
<A NAME="330"></A>to the brim, and made drink offerings to the immortal gods that are from 
<A NAME="331"></A>everlasting, but more particularly to the grey-eyed daughter of 
<A NAME="332"></A>Jove.
<A NAME="333"></A><BR><BR>Thus, then, the ship sped on her way through the watches of the 
<A NAME="334"></A>night from dark till dawn.
