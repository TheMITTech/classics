<A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A>Now when Jove had thus brought Hector and the Trojans to the ships, he 
<A NAME="11"></A>left them to their never-ending toil, and turned his keen eyes away, looking 
<A NAME="12"></A>elsewhither towards the horse-breeders of Thrace, the Mysians, fighters 
<A NAME="13"></A>at close quarters, the noble Hippemolgi, who live on milk, and the Abians, 
<A NAME="14"></A>justest of mankind. He no longer turned so much as a glance towards Troy, 
<A NAME="15"></A>for he did not think that any of the immortals would go and help either 
<A NAME="16"></A>Trojans or Danaans.
<A NAME="17"></A><BR><BR>But King Neptune had kept no blind look-out; he had been looking 
<A NAME="18"></A>admiringly on the battle from his seat on the topmost crests of wooded 
<A NAME="19"></A>Samothrace, whence he could see all Ida, with the city of Priam and the 
<A NAME="20"></A>ships of the Achaeans. He had come from under the sea and taken his place 
<A NAME="21"></A>here, for he pitied the Achaeans who were being overcome by the Trojans; 
<A NAME="22"></A>and he was furiously angry with Jove.
<A NAME="23"></A><BR><BR>Presently he came down from his post on the mountain top, and as 
<A NAME="24"></A>he strode swiftly onwards the high hills and the forest quaked beneath 
<A NAME="25"></A>the tread of his immortal feet. Three strides he took, and with the fourth 
<A NAME="26"></A>he reached his goal- Aegae, where is his glittering golden palace, imperishable, 
<A NAME="27"></A>in the depths of the sea. When he got there, he yoked his fleet brazen-footed 
<A NAME="28"></A>steeds with their manes of gold all flying in the wind; he clothed himself 
<A NAME="29"></A>in raiment of gold, grasped his gold whip, and took his stand upon his 
<A NAME="30"></A>chariot. As he went his way over the waves the sea-monsters left their 
<A NAME="31"></A>lairs, for they knew their lord, and came gambolling round him from every 
<A NAME="32"></A>quarter of the deep, while the sea in her gladness opened a path before 
<A NAME="33"></A>his chariot. So lightly did the horses fly that the bronze axle of the 
<A NAME="34"></A>car was not even wet beneath it; and thus his bounding steeds took him 
<A NAME="35"></A>to the ships of the Achaeans.
<A NAME="36"></A><BR><BR>Now there is a certain huge cavern in the depths of the sea midway 
<A NAME="37"></A>between Tenedos and rocky Imbrus; here Neptune lord of the earthquake stayed 
<A NAME="38"></A>his horses, unyoked them, and set before them their ambrosial forage. He 
<A NAME="39"></A>hobbled their feet with hobbles of gold which none could either unloose 
<A NAME="40"></A>or break, so that they might stay there in that place until their lord 
<A NAME="41"></A>should return. This done he went his way to the host of the 
<A NAME="42"></A>Achaeans.
<A NAME="43"></A><BR><BR>Now the Trojans followed Hector son of Priam in close array like 
<A NAME="44"></A>a storm-cloud or flame of fire, fighting with might and main and raising 
<A NAME="45"></A>the cry battle; for they deemed that they should take the ships of the 
<A NAME="46"></A>Achaeans and kill all their chiefest heroes then and there. Meanwhile earth-encircling 
<A NAME="47"></A>Neptune lord of the earthquake cheered on the Argives, for he had come 
<A NAME="48"></A>up out of the sea and had assumed the form and voice of 
<A NAME="49"></A>Calchas.
<A NAME="50"></A><BR><BR>First he spoke to the two Ajaxes, who were doing their best already, 
<A NAME="51"></A>and said, "Ajaxes, you two can be the saving of the Achaeans if you will 
<A NAME="52"></A>put out all your strength and not let yourselves be daunted. I am not afraid 
<A NAME="53"></A>that the Trojans, who have got over the wall in force, will be victorious 
<A NAME="54"></A>in any other part, for the Achaeans can hold all of them in check, but 
<A NAME="55"></A>I much fear that some evil will befall us here where furious Hector, who 
<A NAME="56"></A>boasts himself the son of great Jove himself, is leading them on like a 
<A NAME="57"></A>pillar of flame. May some god, then, put it into your hearts to make a 
<A NAME="58"></A>firm stand here, and to incite others to do the like. In this case you 
<A NAME="59"></A>will drive him from the ships even though he be inspired by Jove 
<A NAME="60"></A>himself."
<A NAME="61"></A><BR><BR>As he spoke the earth-encircling lord of the earthquake struck 
<A NAME="62"></A>both of them with his sceptre and filled their hearts with daring. He made 
<A NAME="63"></A>their legs light and active, as also their hands and their feet. Then, 
<A NAME="64"></A>as the soaring falcon poises on the wing high above some sheer rock, and 
<A NAME="65"></A>presently swoops down to chase some bird over the plain, even so did Neptune 
<A NAME="66"></A>lord of the earthquake wing his flight into the air and leave them. Of 
<A NAME="67"></A>the two, swift Ajax son of Oileus was the first to know who it was that 
<A NAME="68"></A>had been speaking with them, and said to Ajax son of Telamon, "Ajax, this 
<A NAME="69"></A>is one of the gods that dwell on Olympus, who in the likeness of the prophet 
<A NAME="70"></A>is bidding us fight hard by our ships. It was not Calchas the seer and 
<A NAME="71"></A>diviner of omens; I knew him at once by his feet and knees as he turned 
<A NAME="72"></A>away, for the gods are soon recognised. Moreover I feel the lust of battle 
<A NAME="73"></A>burn more fiercely within me, while my hands and my feet under me are more 
<A NAME="74"></A>eager for the fray."
<A NAME="75"></A><BR><BR>And Ajax son of Telamon answered, "I too feel my hands grasp my 
<A NAME="76"></A>spear more firmly; my strength is greater, and my feet more nimble; I long, 
<A NAME="77"></A>moreover, to meet furious Hector son of Priam, even in single 
<A NAME="78"></A>combat."
<A NAME="79"></A><BR><BR>Thus did they converse, exulting in the hunger after battle with 
<A NAME="80"></A>which the god had filled them. Meanwhile the earth-encircler roused the 
<A NAME="81"></A>Achaeans, who were resting in the rear by the ships overcome at once by 
<A NAME="82"></A>hard fighting and by grief at seeing that the Trojans had got over the 
<A NAME="83"></A>wall in force. Tears began falling from their eyes as they beheld them, 
<A NAME="84"></A>for they made sure that they should not escape destruction; but the lord 
<A NAME="85"></A>of the earthquake passed lightly about among them and urged their battalions 
<A NAME="86"></A>to the front.
<A NAME="87"></A><BR><BR>First he went up to Teucer and Leitus, the hero Peneleos, and Thoas 
<A NAME="88"></A>and Deipyrus; Meriones also and Antilochus, valiant warriors; all did he 
<A NAME="89"></A>exhort. "Shame on you young Argives," he cried, "it was on your prowess 
<A NAME="90"></A>I relied for the saving of our ships; if you fight not with might and main, 
<A NAME="91"></A>this very day will see us overcome by the Trojans. Of a truth my eyes behold 
<A NAME="92"></A>a great and terrible portent which I had never thought to see- the Trojans 
<A NAME="93"></A>at our ships- they, who were heretofore like panic-stricken hinds, the 
<A NAME="94"></A>prey of jackals and wolves in a forest, with no strength but in flight 
<A NAME="95"></A>for they cannot defend themselves. Hitherto the Trojans dared not for one 
<A NAME="96"></A>moment face the attack of the Achaeans, but now they have sallied far from 
<A NAME="97"></A>their city and are fighting at our very ships through the cowardice of 
<A NAME="98"></A>our leader and the disaffection of the people themselves, who in their 
<A NAME="99"></A>discontent care not to fight in defence of the ships but are being slaughtered 
<A NAME="100"></A>near them. True, King Agamemnon son of Atreus is the cause of our disaster 
<A NAME="101"></A>by having insulted the son of Peleus, still this is no reason why we should 
<A NAME="102"></A>leave off fighting. Let us be quick to heal, for the hearts of the brave 
<A NAME="103"></A>heal quickly. You do ill to be thus remiss, you, who are the finest soldiers 
<A NAME="104"></A>in our whole army. I blame no man for keeping out of battle if he is a 
<A NAME="105"></A>weakling, but I am indignant with such men as you are. My good friends, 
<A NAME="106"></A>matters will soon become even worse through this slackness; think, each 
<A NAME="107"></A>one of you, of his own honour and credit, for the hazard of the fight is 
<A NAME="108"></A>extreme. Great Hector is now fighting at our ships; he has broken through 
<A NAME="109"></A>the gates and the strong bolt that held them."
<A NAME="110"></A><BR><BR>Thus did the earth-encircler address the Achaeans and urge them 
<A NAME="111"></A>on. Thereon round the two Ajaxes there gathered strong bands of men, of 
<A NAME="112"></A>whom not even Mars nor Minerva, marshaller of hosts could make light if 
<A NAME="113"></A>they went among them, for they were the picked men of all those who were 
<A NAME="114"></A>now awaiting the onset of Hector and the Trojans. They made a living fence, 
<A NAME="115"></A>spear to spear, shield to shield, buckler to buckler, helmet to helmet, 
<A NAME="116"></A>and man to man. The horse-hair crests on their gleaming helmets touched 
<A NAME="117"></A>one another as they nodded forward, so closely seffied were they; the spears 
<A NAME="118"></A>they brandished in their strong hands were interlaced, and their hearts 
<A NAME="119"></A>were set on battle.
<A NAME="120"></A><BR><BR>The Trojans advanced in a dense body, with Hector at their head 
<A NAME="121"></A>pressing right on as a rock that comes thundering down the side of some 
<A NAME="122"></A>mountain from whose brow the winter torrents have torn it; the foundations 
<A NAME="123"></A>of the dull thing have been loosened by floods of rain, and as it bounds 
<A NAME="124"></A>headlong on its way it sets the whole forest in an uproar; it swerves neither 
<A NAME="125"></A>to right nor left till it reaches level ground, but then for all its fury 
<A NAME="126"></A>it can go no further- even so easily did Hector for a while seem as though 
<A NAME="127"></A>he would career through the tents and ships of the Achaeans till he had 
<A NAME="128"></A>reached the sea in his murderous course; but the closely serried battalions 
<A NAME="129"></A>stayed him when he reached them, for the sons of the Achaeans thrust at 
<A NAME="130"></A>him with swords and spears pointed at both ends, and drove him from them 
<A NAME="131"></A>so that he staggered and gave ground; thereon he shouted to the Trojans, 
<A NAME="132"></A>"Trojans, Lycians, and Dardanians, fighters in close combat, stand firm: 
<A NAME="133"></A>the Achaeans have set themselves as a wall against me, but they will not 
<A NAME="134"></A>check me for long; they will give ground before me if the mightiest of 
<A NAME="135"></A>the gods, the thundering spouse of Juno, has indeed inspired my 
<A NAME="136"></A>onset."
<A NAME="137"></A><BR><BR>With these words he put heart and soul into them all. Deiphobus 
<A NAME="138"></A>son of Priam went about among them intent on deeds of daring with his round 
<A NAME="139"></A>shield before him, under cover of which he strode quickly forward. Meriones 
<A NAME="140"></A>took aim at him with a spear, nor did he fail to hit the broad orb of ox-hide; 
<A NAME="141"></A>but he was far from piercing it for the spear broke in two pieces long 
<A NAME="142"></A>ere he could do so; moreover Deiphobus had seen it coming and had held 
<A NAME="143"></A>his shield well away from him. Meriones drew back under cover of his comrades, 
<A NAME="144"></A>angry alike at having failed to vanquish Deiphobus, and having broken his 
<A NAME="145"></A>spear. He turned therefore towards the ships and tents to fetch a spear 
<A NAME="146"></A>which he had left behind in his tent.
<A NAME="147"></A><BR><BR>The others continued fighting, and the cry of battle rose up into 
<A NAME="148"></A>the heavens. Teucer son of Telamon was the first to kill his man, to wit, 
<A NAME="149"></A>the warrior Imbrius son of Mentor rich in horses. Until the Achaeans came 
<A NAME="150"></A>he had lived in Pedaeum, and had married Medesicaste a bastard daughter 
<A NAME="151"></A>of Priam; but on the arrival of the Danaan fleet he had gone back to Ilius, 
<A NAME="152"></A>and was a great man among the Trojans, dwelling near Priam himself, who 
<A NAME="153"></A>gave him like honour with his own sons. The son of Telamon now struck him 
<A NAME="154"></A>under the ear with a spear which he then drew back again, and Imbrius fell 
<A NAME="155"></A>headlong as an ash-tree when it is felled on the crest of some high mountain 
<A NAME="156"></A>beacon, and its delicate green foliage comes toppling down to the ground. 
<A NAME="157"></A>Thus did he fall with his bronze-dight armour ringing harshly round him, 
<A NAME="158"></A>and Teucer sprang forward with intent to strip him of his armour; but as 
<A NAME="159"></A>he was doing so, Hector took aim at him with a spear. Teucer saw the spear 
<A NAME="160"></A>coming and swerved aside, whereon it hit Amphimachus, son of Cteatus son 
<A NAME="161"></A>of Actor, in the chest as he was coming into battle, and his armour rang 
<A NAME="162"></A>rattling round him as he fell heavily to the ground. Hector sprang forward 
<A NAME="163"></A>to take Amphimachus's helmet from off his temples, and in a moment Ajax 
<A NAME="164"></A>threw a spear at him, but did not wound him, for he was encased all over 
<A NAME="165"></A>in his terrible armour; nevertheless the spear struck the boss of his shield 
<A NAME="166"></A>with such force as to drive him back from the two corpses, which the Achaeans 
<A NAME="167"></A>then drew off. Stichius and Menestheus, captains of the Athenians, bore 
<A NAME="168"></A>away Amphimachus to the host of the Achaeans, while the two brave and impetuous 
<A NAME="169"></A>Ajaxes did the like by Imbrius. As two lions snatch a goat from the hounds 
<A NAME="170"></A>that have it in their fangs, and bear it through thick brushwood high above 
<A NAME="171"></A>the ground in their jaws, thus did the Ajaxes bear aloft the body of Imbrius, 
<A NAME="172"></A>and strip it of its armour. Then the son of Oileus severed the head from 
<A NAME="173"></A>the neck in revenge for the death of Amphimachus, and sent it whirling 
<A NAME="174"></A>over the crowd as though it had been a ball, till fell in the dust at Hector's 
<A NAME="175"></A>feet.
<A NAME="176"></A><BR><BR>Neptune was exceedingly angry that his grandson Amphimachus should 
<A NAME="177"></A>have fallen; he therefore went to the tents and ships of the Achaeans to 
<A NAME="178"></A>urge the Danaans still further, and to devise evil for the Trojans. Idomeneus 
<A NAME="179"></A>met him, as he was taking leave of a comrade, who had just come to him 
<A NAME="180"></A>from the fight, wounded in the knee. His fellow-soldiers bore him off the 
<A NAME="181"></A>field, and Idomeneus having given orders to the physicians went on to his 
<A NAME="182"></A>tent, for he was still thirsting for battle. Neptune spoke in the likeness 
<A NAME="183"></A>and with the voice of Thoas son of Andraemon who ruled the Aetolians of 
<A NAME="184"></A>all Pleuron and high Calydon, and was honoured among his people as though 
<A NAME="185"></A>he were a god. "Idomeneus," said he, "lawgiver to the Cretans, what has 
<A NAME="186"></A>now become of the threats with which the sons of the Achaeans used to threaten 
<A NAME="187"></A>the Trojans?"
<A NAME="188"></A><BR><BR>And Idomeneus chief among the Cretans answered, "Thoas, no one, 
<A NAME="189"></A>so far as I know, is in fault, for we can all fight. None are held back 
<A NAME="190"></A>neither by fear nor slackness, but it seems to be the of almighty Jove 
<A NAME="191"></A>that the Achaeans should perish ingloriously here far from Argos: you, 
<A NAME="192"></A>Thoas, have been always staunch, and you keep others in heart if you see 
<A NAME="193"></A>any fail in duty; be not then remiss now, but exhort all to do their 
<A NAME="194"></A>utmost."
<A NAME="195"></A><BR><BR>To this Neptune lord of the earthquake made answer, "Idomeneus, 
<A NAME="196"></A>may he never return from Troy, but remain here for dogs to batten upon, 
<A NAME="197"></A>who is this day wilfully slack in fighting. Get your armour and go, we 
<A NAME="198"></A>must make all haste together if we may be of any use, though we are only 
<A NAME="199"></A>two. Even cowards gain courage from companionship, and we two can hold 
<A NAME="200"></A>our own with the bravest."
<A NAME="201"></A><BR><BR>Therewith the god went back into the thick of the fight, and Idomeneus 
<A NAME="202"></A>when he had reached his tent donned his armour, grasped his two spears, 
<A NAME="203"></A>and sallied forth. As the lightning which the son of Saturn brandishes 
<A NAME="204"></A>from bright Olympus when he would show a sign to mortals, and its gleam 
<A NAME="205"></A>flashes far and wide- even so did his armour gleam about him as he ran. 
<A NAME="206"></A>Meriones his sturdy squire met him while he was still near his tent (for 
<A NAME="207"></A>he was going to fetch his spear) and Idomeneus said
<A NAME="208"></A><BR><BR>"Meriones, fleet son of Molus, best of comrades, why have you left 
<A NAME="209"></A>the field? Are you wounded, and is the point of the weapon hurting you? 
<A NAME="210"></A>or have you been sent to fetch me? I want no fetching; I had far rather 
<A NAME="211"></A>fight than stay in my tent."
<A NAME="212"></A><BR><BR>"Idomeneus," answered Meriones, "I come for a spear, if I can find 
<A NAME="213"></A>one in my tent; I have broken the one I had, in throwing it at the shield 
<A NAME="214"></A>of Deiphobus."
<A NAME="215"></A><BR><BR>And Idomeneus captain of the Cretans answered, "You will find one 
<A NAME="216"></A>spear, or twenty if you so please, standing up against the end wall of 
<A NAME="217"></A>my tent. I have taken them from Trojans whom I have killed, for I am not 
<A NAME="218"></A>one to keep my enemy at arm's length; therefore I have spears, bossed shields, 
<A NAME="219"></A>helmets, and burnished corslets."
<A NAME="220"></A><BR><BR>Then Meriones said, "I too in my tent and at my ship have spoils 
<A NAME="221"></A>taken from the Trojans, but they are not at hand. I have been at all times 
<A NAME="222"></A>valorous, and wherever there has been hard fighting have held my own among 
<A NAME="223"></A>the foremost. There may be those among the Achaeans who do not know how 
<A NAME="224"></A>I fight, but you know it well enough yourself."
<A NAME="225"></A><BR><BR>Idomeneus answered, "I know you for a brave man: you need not tell 
<A NAME="226"></A>me. If the best men at the ships were being chosen to go on an ambush- 
<A NAME="227"></A>and there is nothing like this for showing what a man is made of; it comes 
<A NAME="228"></A>out then who is cowardly and who brave; the coward will change colour at 
<A NAME="229"></A>every touch and turn; he is full of fears, and keeps shifting his weight 
<A NAME="230"></A>first on one knee and then on the other; his heart beats fast as he thinks 
<A NAME="231"></A>of death, and one can hear the chattering of his teeth; whereas the brave 
<A NAME="232"></A>man will not change colour nor be on finding himself in ambush, but is 
<A NAME="233"></A>all the time longing to go into action- if the best men were being chosen 
<A NAME="234"></A>for such a service, no one could make light of your courage nor feats of 
<A NAME="235"></A>arms. If you were struck by a dart or smitten in close combat, it would 
<A NAME="236"></A>not be from behind, in your neck nor back, but the weapon would hit you 
<A NAME="237"></A>in the chest or belly as you were pressing forward to a place in the front 
<A NAME="238"></A>ranks. But let us no longer stay here talking like children, lest we be 
<A NAME="239"></A>ill spoken of; go, fetch your spear from the tent at 
<A NAME="240"></A>once."
<A NAME="241"></A><BR><BR>On this Meriones, peer of Mars, went to the tent and got himself 
<A NAME="242"></A>a spear of bronze. He then followed after Idomeneus, big with great deeds 
<A NAME="243"></A>of valour. As when baneful Mars sallies forth to battle, and his son Panic 
<A NAME="244"></A>so strong and dauntless goes with him, to strike terror even into the heart 
<A NAME="245"></A>of a hero- the pair have gone from Thrace to arm themselves among the Ephyri 
<A NAME="246"></A>or the brave Phlegyans, but they will not listen to both the contending 
<A NAME="247"></A>hosts, and will give victory to one side or to the other- even so did Meriones 
<A NAME="248"></A>and Idomeneus, captains of men, go out to battle clad in their bronze armour. 
<A NAME="249"></A>Meriones was first to speak. "Son of Deucalion," said he, "where would 
<A NAME="250"></A>you have us begin fighting? On the right wing of the host, in the centre, 
<A NAME="251"></A>or on the left wing, where I take it the Achaeans will be 
<A NAME="252"></A>weakest?"
<A NAME="253"></A><BR><BR>Idomeneus answered, "There are others to defend the centre- the 
<A NAME="254"></A>two Ajaxes and Teucer, who is the finest archer of all the Achaeans, and 
<A NAME="255"></A>is good also in a hand-to-hand fight. These will give Hector son of Priam 
<A NAME="256"></A>enough to do; fight as he may, he will find it hard to vanquish their indomitable 
<A NAME="257"></A>fury, and fire the ships, unless the son of Saturn fling a firebrand upon 
<A NAME="258"></A>them with his own hand. Great Ajax son of Telamon will yield to no man 
<A NAME="259"></A>who is in mortal mould and eats the grain of Ceres, if bronze and great 
<A NAME="260"></A>stones can overthrow him. He would not yield even to Achilles in hand-to-hand 
<A NAME="261"></A>fight, and in fleetness of foot there is none to beat him; let us turn 
<A NAME="262"></A>therefore towards the left wing, that we may know forthwith whether we 
<A NAME="263"></A>are to give glory to some other, or he to us."
<A NAME="264"></A><BR><BR>Meriones, peer of fleet Mars, then led the way till they came to 
<A NAME="265"></A>the part of the host which Idomeneus had named.
<A NAME="266"></A><BR><BR>Now when the Trojans saw Idomeneus coming on like a flame of fire, 
<A NAME="267"></A>him and his squire clad in their richly wrought armour, they shouted and 
<A NAME="268"></A>made towards him all in a body, and a furious hand-to-hand fight raged 
<A NAME="269"></A>under the ships' sterns. Fierce as the shrill winds that whistle upon a 
<A NAME="270"></A>day when dust lies deep on the roads, and the gusts raise it into a thick 
<A NAME="271"></A>cloud- even such was the fury of the combat, and might and main did they 
<A NAME="272"></A>hack at each other with spear and sword throughout the host. The field 
<A NAME="273"></A>bristled with the long and deadly spears which they bore. Dazzling was 
<A NAME="274"></A>the sheen of their gleaming helmets, their fresh-burnished breastplates, 
<A NAME="275"></A>and glittering shields as they joined battle with one another. Iron indeed 
<A NAME="276"></A>must be his courage who could take pleasure in the sight of such a turmoil, 
<A NAME="277"></A>and look on it without being dismayed.
<A NAME="278"></A><BR><BR>Thus did the two mighty sons of Saturn devise evil for mortal heroes. 
<A NAME="279"></A>Jove was minded to give victory to the Trojans and to Hector, so as to 
<A NAME="280"></A>do honour to fleet Achilles, nevertheless he did not mean to utterly overthrow 
<A NAME="281"></A>the Achaean host before Ilius, and only wanted to glorify Thetis and her 
<A NAME="282"></A>valiant son. Neptune on the other hand went about among the Argives to 
<A NAME="283"></A>incite them, having come up from the grey sea in secret, for he was grieved 
<A NAME="284"></A>at seeing them vanquished by the Trojans, and was furiously angry with 
<A NAME="285"></A>Jove. Both were of the same race and country, but Jove was elder born and 
<A NAME="286"></A>knew more, therefore Neptune feared to defend the Argives openly, but in 
<A NAME="287"></A>the likeness of man, he kept on encouraging them throughout their host. 
<A NAME="288"></A>Thus, then, did these two devise a knot of war and battle, that none could 
<A NAME="289"></A>unloose or break, and set both sides tugging at it, to the failing of men's 
<A NAME="290"></A>knees beneath them.
<A NAME="291"></A><BR><BR>And now Idomeneus, though his hair was already flecked with grey, 
<A NAME="292"></A>called loud on the Danaans and spread panic among the Trojans as he leaped 
<A NAME="293"></A>in among them. He slew Othryoneus from Cabesus, a sojourner, who had but 
<A NAME="294"></A>lately come to take part in the war. He sought Cassandra the fairest of 
<A NAME="295"></A>Priam's daughters in marriage, but offered no gifts of wooing, for he promised 
<A NAME="296"></A>a great thing, to wit, that he would drive the sons of the Achaeans willy 
<A NAME="297"></A>nilly from Troy; old King Priam had given his consent and promised her 
<A NAME="298"></A>to him, whereon he fought on the strength of the promises thus made to 
<A NAME="299"></A>him. Idomeneus aimed a spear, and hit him as he came striding on. His cuirass 
<A NAME="300"></A>of bronze did not protect him, and the spear stuck in his belly, so that 
<A NAME="301"></A>he fell heavily to the ground. Then Idomeneus vaunted over him saying, 
<A NAME="302"></A>"Othryoneus, there is no one in the world whom I shall admire more than 
<A NAME="303"></A>I do you, if you indeed perform what you have promised Priam son of Dardanus 
<A NAME="304"></A>in return for his daughter. We too will make you an offer; we will give 
<A NAME="305"></A>you the loveliest daughter of the son of Atreus, and will bring her from 
<A NAME="306"></A>Argos for you to marry, if you will sack the goodly city of Ilius in company 
<A NAME="307"></A>with ourselves; so come along with me, that we may make a covenant at the 
<A NAME="308"></A>ships about the marriage, and we will not be hard upon you about gifts 
<A NAME="309"></A>of wooing."
<A NAME="310"></A><BR><BR>With this Idomeneus began dragging him by the foot through the 
<A NAME="311"></A>thick of the fight, but Asius came up to protect the body, on foot, in 
<A NAME="312"></A>front of his horses which his esquire drove so close behind him that he 
<A NAME="313"></A>could feel their 'breath upon his shoulder. He was longing to strike down 
<A NAME="314"></A>Idomeneus, but ere he could do so Idomeneus smote him with his spear in 
<A NAME="315"></A>the throat under the chin, and the bronze point went clean through it. 
<A NAME="316"></A>He fell as an oak, or poplar, or pine which shipwrights have felled for 
<A NAME="317"></A>ship's timber upon the mountains with whetted axes- even thus did he lie 
<A NAME="318"></A>full length in front of his chariot and horses, grinding his teeth and 
<A NAME="319"></A>clutching at the bloodstained just. His charioteer was struck with panic 
<A NAME="320"></A>and did not dare turn his horses round and escape: thereupon Antilochus 
<A NAME="321"></A>hit him in the middle of his body with a spear; his cuirass of bronze did 
<A NAME="322"></A>not protect him, and the spear stuck in his belly. He fell gasping from 
<A NAME="323"></A>his chariot and Antilochus great Nestor's son, drove his horses from the 
<A NAME="324"></A>Trojans to the Achaeans.
<A NAME="325"></A><BR><BR>Deiphobus then came close up to Idomeneus to avenge Asius, and 
<A NAME="326"></A>took aim at him with a spear, but Idomeneus was on the look-out and avoided 
<A NAME="327"></A>it, for he was covered by the round shield he always bore- a shield of 
<A NAME="328"></A>oxhide and bronze with two arm-rods on the inside. He crouched under cover 
<A NAME="329"></A>of this, and the spear flew over him, but the shield rang out as the spear 
<A NAME="330"></A>grazed it, and the weapon sped not in vain from the strong hand of Deiphobus, 
<A NAME="331"></A>for it struck Hypsenor son of Hippasus, shepherd of his people, in the 
<A NAME="332"></A>liver under the midriff, and his limbs failed beneath him. Deiphobus vaunted 
<A NAME="333"></A>over him and cried with a loud voice saying, "Of a truth Asius has not 
<A NAME="334"></A>fallen unavenied; he will be glad even while passing into the house of 
<A NAME="335"></A>Hades, strong warden of the gate, that I have sent some one to escort 
<A NAME="336"></A>him."
<A NAME="337"></A><BR><BR>Thus did he vaunt, and the Argives were stung by his saying. Noble 
<A NAME="338"></A>Antilochus was more angry than any one, but grief did not make him forget 
<A NAME="339"></A>his friend and comrade. He ran up to him, bestrode him, and covered him 
<A NAME="340"></A>with his shield; then two of his staunch comrades, Mecisteus son of Echius, 
<A NAME="341"></A>and Alastor stooped down, and bore him away groaning heavily to the ships. 
<A NAME="342"></A>But Idomeneus ceased not his fury. He kept on striving continually either 
<A NAME="343"></A>to enshroud some Trojan in the darkness of death, or himself to fall while 
<A NAME="344"></A>warding off the evil day from the Achaeans. Then fell Alcathous son of 
<A NAME="345"></A>noble Aesyetes: he was son-in-law to Anchises, having married his eldest 
<A NAME="346"></A>daughter Hippodameia who was the darling of her father and mother, and 
<A NAME="347"></A>excelled all her generation in beauty, accomplishments, and understanding, 
<A NAME="348"></A>wherefore the bravest man in all Troy had taken her to wife- him did Neptune 
<A NAME="349"></A>lay low by the hand of Idomeneus, blinding his bright eyes and binding 
<A NAME="350"></A>his strong limbs in fetters so that he could neither go back nor to one 
<A NAME="351"></A>side, but stood stock still like pillar or lofty tree when Idomeneus struck 
<A NAME="352"></A>him with a spear in the middle of his chest. The coat of mail that had 
<A NAME="353"></A>hitherto protected his body was now broken, and rang harshly as the spear 
<A NAME="354"></A>tore through it. He fell heavily to the ground, and the spear stuck in 
<A NAME="355"></A>his heart, which still beat, and made the butt-end of the spear quiver 
<A NAME="356"></A>till dread Mars put an end to his life. Idomeneus vaunted over him and 
<A NAME="357"></A>cried with a loud voice saying, "Deiphobus, since you are in a mood to 
<A NAME="358"></A>vaunt, shall we cry quits now that we have killed three men to your one? 
<A NAME="359"></A>Nay, sir, stand in fight with me yourself, that you may learn what manner 
<A NAME="360"></A>of Jove-begotten man am I that have come hither. Jove first begot Minos 
<A NAME="361"></A>chief ruler in Crete, and Minos in his turn begot a son, noble Deucalion; 
<A NAME="362"></A>Deucalion begot me to be a ruler over many men in Crete, and my ships have 
<A NAME="363"></A>now brought me hither, to be the bane of yourself, your father, and the 
<A NAME="364"></A>Trojans."
<A NAME="365"></A><BR><BR>Thus did he speak, and Deiphobus was in two minds, whether to go 
<A NAME="366"></A>back and fetch some other Trojan to help him, or to take up the challenge 
<A NAME="367"></A>single-handed. In the end, he deemed it best to go and fetch Aeneas, whom 
<A NAME="368"></A>he found standing in the rear, for he had long been aggrieved with Priam 
<A NAME="369"></A>because in spite his brave deeds he did not give him his due share of honour. 
<A NAME="370"></A>Deiphobus went up to him and said, "Aeneas, prince among the Trojans, if 
<A NAME="371"></A>you know any ties of kinship, help me now to defend the body of your sister's 
<A NAME="372"></A>husband; come with me to the rescue of Alcathous, who being husband to 
<A NAME="373"></A>your sister brought you up when you were a child in his house, and now 
<A NAME="374"></A>Idomeneus has slain him."
<A NAME="375"></A><BR><BR>With these words he moved the heart of Aeneas, and he went in pursuit 
<A NAME="376"></A>of Idomeneus, big with great deeds of valour; but Idomeneus was not to 
<A NAME="377"></A>be thus daunted as though he were a mere child; he held his ground as a 
<A NAME="378"></A>wild boar at bay upon the mountains, who abides the coming of a great crowd 
<A NAME="379"></A>of men in some lonely place- the bristles stand upright on his back, his 
<A NAME="380"></A>eyes flash fire, and he whets his tusks in his eagerness to defend himself 
<A NAME="381"></A>against hounds and men- even so did famed Idomeneus hold his ground and 
<A NAME="382"></A>budge not at the coming of Aeneas. He cried aloud to his comrades looking 
<A NAME="383"></A>towards Ascalaphus, Aphareus, Deipyrus, Meriones, and Antilochus, all of 
<A NAME="384"></A>them brave soldiers- "Hither my friends," he cried, "and leave me not single-handed- 
<A NAME="385"></A>I go in great fear by fleet Aeneas, who is coming against me, and is a 
<A NAME="386"></A>redoubtable dispenser of death battle. Moreover he is in the flower of 
<A NAME="387"></A>youth when a man's strength is greatest; if I was of the same age as he 
<A NAME="388"></A>is and in my present mind, either he or I should soon bear away the prize 
<A NAME="389"></A>of victory
<A NAME="390"></A><BR><BR>On this, all of them as one man stood near him, shield on shoulder. 
<A NAME="391"></A>Aeneas on the other side called to his comrades, looking towards Deiphobus, 
<A NAME="392"></A>Paris, and Agenor, who were leaders of the Trojans along with himself, 
<A NAME="393"></A>and the people followed them as sheep follow the ram when they go down 
<A NAME="394"></A>to drink after they have been feeding, and the heart of the shepherd is 
<A NAME="395"></A>glad- even so was the heart of Aeneas gladdened when he saw his people 
<A NAME="396"></A>follow him.
<A NAME="397"></A><BR><BR>Then they fought furiously in close combat about the body of Alcathous, 
<A NAME="398"></A>wielding their long spears; and the bronze armour about their bodies rang 
<A NAME="399"></A>fearfully as they took aim at one another in the press of the fight, while 
<A NAME="400"></A>the two heroes Aeneas and Idomeneus, peers of Mars, outxied every one in 
<A NAME="401"></A>their desire to hack at each other with sword and spear. Aeneas took aim 
<A NAME="402"></A>first, but Idomeneus was on the lookout and avoided the spear, so that 
<A NAME="403"></A>it sped from Aeneas' strong hand in vain, and fell quivering in the ground. 
<A NAME="404"></A>Idomeneus meanwhile smote Oenomaus in the middle of his belly, and broke 
<A NAME="405"></A>the plate of his corslet, whereon his bowels came gushing out and he clutched 
<A NAME="406"></A>the earth in the palms of his hands as he fell sprawling in the dust. Idomeneus 
<A NAME="407"></A>drew his spear out of the body, but could not strip him of the rest of 
<A NAME="408"></A>his armour for the rain of darts that were showered upon him: moreover 
<A NAME="409"></A>his strength was now beginning to fail him so that he could no longer charge, 
<A NAME="410"></A>and could neither spring forward to recover his own weapon nor swerve aside 
<A NAME="411"></A>to avoid one that was aimed at him; therefore, though he still defended 
<A NAME="412"></A>himself in hand-to-hand fight, his heavy feet could not bear him swiftly 
<A NAME="413"></A>out of the battle. Deiphobus aimed a spear at him as he was retreating 
<A NAME="414"></A>slowly from the field, for his bitterness against him was as fierce as 
<A NAME="415"></A>ever, but again he missed him, and hit Ascalaphus, the son of Mars; the 
<A NAME="416"></A>spear went through his shoulder, and he clutched the earth in the palms 
<A NAME="417"></A>of his hands as he fell sprawling in the dust.
<A NAME="418"></A><BR><BR>Grim Mars of awful voice did not yet know that his son had fallen, 
<A NAME="419"></A>for he was sitting on the summits of Olympus under the golden clouds, by 
<A NAME="420"></A>command of Jove, where the other gods were also sitting, forbidden to take 
<A NAME="421"></A>part in the battle. Meanwhile men fought furiously about the body. Deiphobus 
<A NAME="422"></A>tore the helmet from off his head, but Meriones sprang upon him, and struck 
<A NAME="423"></A>him on the arm with a spear so that the visored helmet fell from his hand 
<A NAME="424"></A>and came ringing down upon the ground. Thereon Meriones sprang upon him 
<A NAME="425"></A>like a vulture, drew the spear from his shoulder, and fell back under cover 
<A NAME="426"></A>of his men. Then Polites, own brother of Deiphobus passed his arms around 
<A NAME="427"></A>his waist, and bore him away from the battle till he got to his horses 
<A NAME="428"></A>that were standing in the rear of the fight with the chariot and their 
<A NAME="429"></A>driver. These took him towards the city groaning and in great pain, with 
<A NAME="430"></A>the blood flowing from his arm.
<A NAME="431"></A><BR><BR>The others still fought on, and the battle-cry rose to heaven without 
<A NAME="432"></A>ceasing. Aeneas sprang on Aphareus son of Caletor, and struck him with 
<A NAME="433"></A>a spear in his throat which was turned towards him; his head fell on one 
<A NAME="434"></A>side, his helmet and shield came down along with him, and death, life's 
<A NAME="435"></A>foe, was shed around him. Antilochus spied his chance, flew forward towards 
<A NAME="436"></A>Thoon, and wounded him as he was turning round. He laid open the vein that 
<A NAME="437"></A>runs all the way up the back to the neck; he cut this vein clean away throughout 
<A NAME="438"></A>its whole course, and Thoon fell in the dust face upwards, stretching out 
<A NAME="439"></A>his hands imploringly towards his comrades. Antilochus sprang upon him 
<A NAME="440"></A>and stripped the armour from his shoulders, glaring round him fearfully 
<A NAME="441"></A>as he did so. The Trojans came about him on every side and struck his broad 
<A NAME="442"></A>and gleaming shield, but could not wound his body, for Neptune stood guard 
<A NAME="443"></A>over the son of Nestor, though the darts fell thickly round him. He was 
<A NAME="444"></A>never clear of the foe, but was always in the thick of the fight; his spear 
<A NAME="445"></A>was never idle; he poised and aimed it in every direction, so eager was 
<A NAME="446"></A>he to hit some one from a distance or to fight him hand to 
<A NAME="447"></A>hand.
<A NAME="448"></A><BR><BR>As he was thus aiming among the crowd, he was seen by Adamas son 
<A NAME="449"></A>of Asius, who rushed towards him and struck him with a spear in the middle 
<A NAME="450"></A>of his shield, but Neptune made its point without effect, for he grudged 
<A NAME="451"></A>him the life of Antilochus. One half, therefore, of the spear stuck fast 
<A NAME="452"></A>like a charred stake in Antilochus's shield, while the other lay on the 
<A NAME="453"></A>ground. Adamas then sought shelter under cover of his men, but Meriones 
<A NAME="454"></A>followed after and hit him with a spear midway between the private parts 
<A NAME="455"></A>and the navel, where a wound is particualrly painful to wretched mortals. 
<A NAME="456"></A>There did Meriones transfix him, and he writhed convulsively about the 
<A NAME="457"></A>spear as some bull whom mountain herdsmen have bound with ropes of withes 
<A NAME="458"></A>and are taking away perforce. Even so did he move convulsively for a while, 
<A NAME="459"></A>but not for very long, till Meriones came up and drew the spear out of 
<A NAME="460"></A>his body, and his eyes were veiled in darkness.
<A NAME="461"></A><BR><BR>Helenus then struck Deipyrus with a great Thracian sword, hitting 
<A NAME="462"></A>him on the temple in close combat and tearing the helmet from his head; 
<A NAME="463"></A>the helmet fell to the ground, and one of those who were fighting on the 
<A NAME="464"></A>Achaean side took charge of it as it rolled at his feet, but the eyes of 
<A NAME="465"></A>Deipyrus were closed in the darkness of death.
<A NAME="466"></A><BR><BR>On this Menelaus was grieved, and made menacingly towards Helenus, 
<A NAME="467"></A>brandishing his spear; but Helenus drew his bow, and the two attacked one 
<A NAME="468"></A>another at one and the same moment, the one with his spear, and the other 
<A NAME="469"></A>with his bow and arrow. The son of Priam hit the breastplate of Menelaus's 
<A NAME="470"></A>corslet, but the arrow glanced from off it. As black beans or pulse come 
<A NAME="471"></A>pattering down on to a threshing-floor from the broad winnowing-shovel, 
<A NAME="472"></A>blown by shrill winds and shaken by the shovel- even so did the arrow glance 
<A NAME="473"></A>off and recoil from the shield of Menelaus, who in his turn wounded the 
<A NAME="474"></A>hand with which Helenus carried his bow; the spear went right through his 
<A NAME="475"></A>hand and stuck in the bow itself, so that to his life he retreated under 
<A NAME="476"></A>cover of his men, with his hand dragging by his side- for the spear weighed 
<A NAME="477"></A>it down till Agenor drew it out and bound the hand carefully up in a woollen 
<A NAME="478"></A>sling which his esquire had with him.
<A NAME="479"></A><BR><BR>Pisander then made straight at Menelaus- his evil destiny luring 
<A NAME="480"></A>him on to his doom, for he was to fall in fight with you, O Menelaus. When 
<A NAME="481"></A>the two were hard by one another the spear of the son of Atreus turned 
<A NAME="482"></A>aside and he missed his aim; Pisander then struck the shield of brave Menelaus 
<A NAME="483"></A>but could not pierce it, for the shield stayed the spear and broke the 
<A NAME="484"></A>shaft; nevertheless he was glad and made sure of victory; forthwith, however, 
<A NAME="485"></A>the son of Atreus drew his sword and sprang upon him. Pisander then seized 
<A NAME="486"></A>the bronze battle-axe, with its long and polished handle of olive wood 
<A NAME="487"></A>that hung by his side under his shield, and the two made at one another. 
<A NAME="488"></A>Pisander struck the peak of Menelaus's crested helmet just under the crest 
<A NAME="489"></A>itself, and Menelaus hit Pisander as he was coming towards him, on the 
<A NAME="490"></A>forehead, just at the rise of his nose; the bones cracked and his two gore-bedrabbled 
<A NAME="491"></A>eyes fell by his feet in the dust. He fell backwards to the ground, and 
<A NAME="492"></A>Menelaus set his heel upon him, stripped him of his armour, and vaunted 
<A NAME="493"></A>over him saying, "Even thus shall you Trojans leave the ships of the Achaeans, 
<A NAME="494"></A>proud and insatiate of battle though you be: nor shall you lack any of 
<A NAME="495"></A>the disgrace and shame which you have heaped upon myself. Cowardly she-wolves 
<A NAME="496"></A>that you are, you feared not the anger of dread Jove, avenger of violated 
<A NAME="497"></A>hospitality, who will one day destroy your city; you stole my wedded wife 
<A NAME="498"></A>and wickedly carried off much treasure when you were her guest, and now 
<A NAME="499"></A>you would fling fire upon our ships, and kill our heroes. A day will come 
<A NAME="500"></A>when, rage as you may, you shall be stayed. O father Jove, you, who they 
<A NAME="501"></A>say art above all both gods and men in wisdom, and from whom all things 
<A NAME="502"></A>that befall us do proceed, how can you thus favour the Trojans- men so 
<A NAME="503"></A>proud and overweening, that they are never tired of fighting? All things 
<A NAME="504"></A>pall after a while- sleep, love, sweet song, and stately dance- still these 
<A NAME="505"></A>are things of which a man would surely have his fill rather than of battle, 
<A NAME="506"></A>whereas it is of battle that the Trojans are insatiate."
<A NAME="507"></A><BR><BR>So saying Menelaus stripped the blood-stained armour from the body 
<A NAME="508"></A>of Pisander, and handed it over to his men; then he again ranged himself 
<A NAME="509"></A>among those who were in the front of the fight.
<A NAME="510"></A><BR><BR>Harpalion son of King Pylaemenes then sprang upon him; he had come 
<A NAME="511"></A>to fight at Troy along with his father, but he did not go home again. He 
<A NAME="512"></A>struck the middle of Menelaus's shield with his spear but could not pierce 
<A NAME="513"></A>it, and to save his life drew back under cover of his men, looking round 
<A NAME="514"></A>him on every side lest he should be wounded. But Meriones aimed a bronze-tipped 
<A NAME="515"></A>arrow at him as he was leaving the field, and hit him on the right buttock; 
<A NAME="516"></A>the arrow pierced the bone through and through, and penetrated the bladder, 
<A NAME="517"></A>so he sat down where he was and breathed his last in the arms of his comrades, 
<A NAME="518"></A>stretched like a worm upon the ground and watering the earth with the blood 
<A NAME="519"></A>that flowed from his wound. The brave Paphlagonians tended him with all 
<A NAME="520"></A>due care; they raised him into his chariot, and bore him sadly off to the 
<A NAME="521"></A>city of Troy; his father went also with him weeping bitterly, but there 
<A NAME="522"></A>was no ransom that could bring his dead son to life 
<A NAME="523"></A>again.
<A NAME="524"></A><BR><BR>Paris was deeply grieved by the death of Harpalion, who was his 
<A NAME="525"></A>host when he went among the Paphlagonians; he aimed an arrow, therefore, 
<A NAME="526"></A>in order to avenge him. Now there was a certain man named Euchenor, son 
<A NAME="527"></A>of Polyidus the prophet, a brave man and wealthy, whose home was in Corinth. 
<A NAME="528"></A>This Euchenor had set sail for Troy well knowing that it would be the death 
<A NAME="529"></A>of him, for his good old father Polyidus had often told him that he must 
<A NAME="530"></A>either stay at home and die of a terrible disease, or go with the Achaeans 
<A NAME="531"></A>and perish at the hands of the Trojans; he chose, therefore, to avoid incurring 
<A NAME="532"></A>the heavy fine the Achaeans would have laid upon him, and at the same time 
<A NAME="533"></A>to escape the pain and suffering of disease. Paris now smote him on the 
<A NAME="534"></A>jaw under his ear, whereon the life went out of him and he was enshrouded 
<A NAME="535"></A>in the darkness of death.
<A NAME="536"></A><BR><BR>Thus then did they fight as it were a flaming fire. But Hector 
<A NAME="537"></A>had not yet heard, and did not know that the Argives were making havoc 
<A NAME="538"></A>of his men on the left wing of the battle, where the Achaeans ere long 
<A NAME="539"></A>would have triumphed over them, so vigorously did Neptune cheer them on 
<A NAME="540"></A>and help them. He therefore held on at the point where he had first forced 
<A NAME="541"></A>his way through the gates and the wall, after breaking through the serried 
<A NAME="542"></A>ranks of Danaan warriors. It was here that the ships of Ajax and Protesilaus 
<A NAME="543"></A>were drawn up by the sea-shore; here the wall was at its lowest, and the 
<A NAME="544"></A>fight both of man and horse raged most fiercely. The Boeotians and the 
<A NAME="545"></A>Ionians with their long tunics, the Locrians, the men of Phthia, and the 
<A NAME="546"></A>famous force of the Epeans could hardly stay Hector as he rushed on towards 
<A NAME="547"></A>the ships, nor could they drive him from them, for he was as a wall of 
<A NAME="548"></A>fire. The chosen men of the Athenians were in the van, led by Menestheus 
<A NAME="549"></A>son of Peteos, with whom were also Pheidas, Stichius, and stalwart Bias: 
<A NAME="550"></A>Meges son of Phyleus, Amphion, and Dracius commanded the Epeans, while 
<A NAME="551"></A>Medon and staunch Podarces led the men of Phthia. Of these, Medon was bastard 
<A NAME="552"></A>son to Oileus and brother of Ajax, but he lived in Phylace away from his 
<A NAME="553"></A>own country, for he had killed the brother of his stepmother Eriopis, the 
<A NAME="554"></A>wife of Oileus; the other, Podarces, was the son of Iphiclus son of Phylacus. 
<A NAME="555"></A>These two stood in the van of the Phthians, and defended the ships along 
<A NAME="556"></A>with the Boeotians.
<A NAME="557"></A><BR><BR>Ajax son of Oileus never for a moment left the side of Ajax son 
<A NAME="558"></A>of Telamon, but as two swart oxen both strain their utmost at the plough 
<A NAME="559"></A>which they are drawing in a fallow field, and the sweat steams upwards 
<A NAME="560"></A>from about the roots of their horns- nothing but the yoke divides them 
<A NAME="561"></A>as they break up the ground till they reach the end of the field- even 
<A NAME="562"></A>so did the two Ajaxes stand shoulder to shoulder by one another. Many and 
<A NAME="563"></A>brave comrades followed the son of Telamon, to relieve him of his shield 
<A NAME="564"></A>when he was overcome with sweat and toil, but the Locrians did not follow 
<A NAME="565"></A>so close after the son of Oileus, for they could not hold their own in 
<A NAME="566"></A>a hand-to-hand fight. They had no bronze helmets with plumes of horse-hair, 
<A NAME="567"></A>neither had they shields nor ashen spears, but they had come to Troy armed 
<A NAME="568"></A>with bows, and with slings of twisted wool from which they showered their 
<A NAME="569"></A>missiles to break the ranks of the Trojans. The others, therefore, with 
<A NAME="570"></A>their heavy armour bore the brunt of the fight with the Trojans and with 
<A NAME="571"></A>Hector, while the Locrians shot from behind, under their cover; and thus 
<A NAME="572"></A>the Trojans began to lose heart, for the arrows threw them into 
<A NAME="573"></A>confusion.
<A NAME="574"></A><BR><BR>The Trojans would now have been driven in sorry plight from the 
<A NAME="575"></A>ships and tents back to windy Ilius, had not Polydamas presently said to 
<A NAME="576"></A>Hector, "Hector, there is no persuading you to take advice. Because heaven 
<A NAME="577"></A>has so richly endowed you with the arts of war, you think that you must 
<A NAME="578"></A>therefore excel others in counsel; but you cannot thus claim preeminence 
<A NAME="579"></A>in all things. Heaven has made one man an excellent soldier; of another 
<A NAME="580"></A>it has made a dancer or a singer and player on the lyre; while yet in another 
<A NAME="581"></A>Jove has implanted a wise understanding of which men reap fruit to the 
<A NAME="582"></A>saving of many, and he himself knows more about it than any one; therefore 
<A NAME="583"></A>I will say what I think will be best. The fight has hemmed you in as with 
<A NAME="584"></A>a circle of fire, and even now that the Trojans are within the wall some 
<A NAME="585"></A>of them stand aloof in full armour, while others are fighting scattered 
<A NAME="586"></A>and outnumbered near the ships. Draw back, therefore, and call your chieftains 
<A NAME="587"></A>round you, that we may advise together whether to fall now upon the ships 
<A NAME="588"></A>in the hope that heaven may vouchsafe us victory, or to beat a retreat 
<A NAME="589"></A>while we can yet safely do so. I greatly fear that the Achaeans will pay 
<A NAME="590"></A>us their debt of yesterday in full, for there is one abiding at their ships 
<A NAME="591"></A>who is never weary of battle, and who will not hold aloof much 
<A NAME="592"></A>longer."
<A NAME="593"></A><BR><BR>Thus spoke Polydamas, and his words pleased Hector well. He sprang 
<A NAME="594"></A>in full armour from his chariot and said, "Polydamas, gather the chieftains 
<A NAME="595"></A>here; I will go yonder into the fight, but will return at once when I have 
<A NAME="596"></A>given them their orders."
<A NAME="597"></A><BR><BR>He then sped onward, towering like a snowy mountain, and with a 
<A NAME="598"></A>loud cry flew through the ranks of the Trojans and their allies. When they 
<A NAME="599"></A>heard his voice they all hastened to gather round Polydamas the excellent 
<A NAME="600"></A>son of Panthous, but Hector kept on among the foremost, looking everywhere 
<A NAME="601"></A>to find Deiphobus and prince Helenus, Adamas son of Asius, and Asius son 
<A NAME="602"></A>of Hyrtacus; living, indeed, and scatheless he could no longer find them, 
<A NAME="603"></A>for the two last were lying by the sterns of the Achaean ships, slain by 
<A NAME="604"></A>the Argives, while the others had been also stricken and wounded by them; 
<A NAME="605"></A>but upon the left wing of the dread battle he found Alexandrus, husband 
<A NAME="606"></A>of lovely Helen, cheering his men and urging them on to fight. He went 
<A NAME="607"></A>up to him and upbraided him. "Paris," said he, "evil-hearted Paris, fair 
<A NAME="608"></A>to see but woman-mad and false of tongue, where are Deiphobus and King 
<A NAME="609"></A>Helenus? Where are Adamas son of Asius, and Asius son of Hyrtacus? Where 
<A NAME="610"></A>too is Othryoneus? Ilius is undone and will now surely 
<A NAME="611"></A>fall!"
<A NAME="612"></A><BR><BR>Alexandrus answered, "Hector, why find fault when there is no one 
<A NAME="613"></A>to find fault with? I should hold aloof from battle on any day rather than 
<A NAME="614"></A>this, for my mother bore me with nothing of the coward about me. From the 
<A NAME="615"></A>moment when you set our men fighting about the ships we have been staying 
<A NAME="616"></A>here and doing battle with the Danaans. Our comrades about whom you ask 
<A NAME="617"></A>me are dead; Deiphobus and King Helenus alone have left the field, wounded 
<A NAME="618"></A>both of them in the hand, but the son of Saturn saved them alive. Now, 
<A NAME="619"></A>therefore, lead on where you would have us go, and we will follow with 
<A NAME="620"></A>right goodwill; you shall not find us fail you in so far as our strength 
<A NAME="621"></A>holds out, but no man can do more than in him lies, no matter how willing 
<A NAME="622"></A>he may be."
<A NAME="623"></A><BR><BR>With these words he satisfied his brother, and the two went towards 
<A NAME="624"></A>the part of the battle where the fight was thickest, about Cebriones, brave 
<A NAME="625"></A>Polydamas, Phalces, Orthaeus, godlike Polyphetes, Palmys, Ascanius, and 
<A NAME="626"></A>Morys son of Hippotion, who had come from fertile Ascania on the preceding 
<A NAME="627"></A>day to relieve other troops. Then Jove urged them on to fight. They flew 
<A NAME="628"></A>forth like the blasts of some fierce wind that strike earth in the van 
<A NAME="629"></A>of a thunderstorm- they buffet the salt sea into an uproar; many and mighty 
<A NAME="630"></A>are the great waves that come crashing in one after the other upon the 
<A NAME="631"></A>shore with their arching heads all crested with foam- even so did rank 
<A NAME="632"></A>behind rank of Trojans arrayed in gleaming armour follow their leaders 
<A NAME="633"></A>onward. The way was led by Hector son of Priam, peer of murderous Mars, 
<A NAME="634"></A>with his round shield before him- his shield of ox-hides covered with plates 
<A NAME="635"></A>of bronze- and his gleaming helmet upon his temples. He kept stepping forward 
<A NAME="636"></A>under cover of his shield in every direction, making trial of the ranks 
<A NAME="637"></A>to see if they would give way be him, but he could not daunt the courage 
<A NAME="638"></A>of the Achaeans. Ajax was the first to stride out and challenge him. "Sir," 
<A NAME="639"></A>he cried, "draw near; why do you think thus vainly to dismay the Argives? 
<A NAME="640"></A>We Achaeans are excellent soldiers, but the scourge of Jove has fallen 
<A NAME="641"></A>heavily upon us. Your heart, forsooth, is set on destroying our ships, 
<A NAME="642"></A>but we too have bands that can keep you at bay, and your own fair town 
<A NAME="643"></A>shall be sooner taken and sacked by ourselves. The time is near when you 
<A NAME="644"></A>shall pray Jove and all the gods in your flight, that your steeds may be 
<A NAME="645"></A>swifter than hawks as they raise the dust on the plain and bear you back 
<A NAME="646"></A>to your city."
<A NAME="647"></A><BR><BR>As he was thus speaking a bird flew by upon his right hand, and 
<A NAME="648"></A>the host of the Achaeans shouted, for they took heart at the omen. But 
<A NAME="649"></A>Hector answered, "Ajax, braggart and false of tongue, would that I were 
<A NAME="650"></A>as sure of being son for evermore to aegis-bearing Jove, with Queen Juno 
<A NAME="651"></A>for my mother, and of being held in like honour with Minerva and Apollo, 
<A NAME="652"></A>as I am that this day is big with the destruction of the Achaeans; and 
<A NAME="653"></A>you shall fall among them if you dare abide my spear; it shall rend your 
<A NAME="654"></A>fair body and bid you glut our hounds and birds of prey with your fat and 
<A NAME="655"></A>your flesh, as you fall by the ships of the Achaeans."
<A NAME="656"></A><BR><BR>With these words he led the way and the others followed after with 
<A NAME="657"></A>a cry that rent the air, while the host shouted behind them. The Argives 
<A NAME="658"></A>on their part raised a shout likewise, nor did they forget their prowess, 
<A NAME="659"></A>but stood firm against the onslaught of the Trojan chieftains, and the 
<A NAME="660"></A>cry from both the hosts rose up to heaven and to the brightness of Jove's 
<A NAME="661"></A>presence.
