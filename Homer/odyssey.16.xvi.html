<A NAME="10"></A>Meanwhile Ulysses and the swineherd had lit a fire in the hut and were 
<A NAME="11"></A>were getting breakfast ready at daybreak for they had sent the men out 
<A NAME="12"></A>with the pigs. When Telemachus came up, the dogs did not bark, but fawned 
<A NAME="13"></A>upon him, so Ulysses, hearing the sound of feet and noticing that the dogs 
<A NAME="14"></A>did not bark, said to Eumaeus:
<A NAME="15"></A><BR><BR>"Eumaeus, I hear footsteps; I suppose one of your men or some one 
<A NAME="16"></A>of your acquaintance is coming here, for the dogs are fawning urn him and 
<A NAME="17"></A>not barking."
<A NAME="18"></A><BR><BR>The words were hardly out of his mouth before his son stood at 
<A NAME="19"></A>the door. Eumaeus sprang to his feet, and the bowls in which he was mixing 
<A NAME="20"></A>wine fell from his hands, as he made towards his master. He kissed his 
<A NAME="21"></A>head and both his beautiful eyes, and wept for joy. A father could not 
<A NAME="22"></A>be more delighted at the return of an only son, the child of his old age, 
<A NAME="23"></A>after ten years' absence in a foreign country and after having gone through 
<A NAME="24"></A>much hardship. He embraced him, kissed him all over as though he had come 
<A NAME="25"></A>back from the dead, and spoke fondly to him saying:
<A NAME="26"></A><BR><BR>"So you are come, Telemachus, light of my eyes that you are. When 
<A NAME="27"></A>I heard you had gone to Pylos I made sure I was never going to see you 
<A NAME="28"></A>any more. Come in, my dear child, and sit down, that I may have a good 
<A NAME="29"></A>look at you now you are home again; it is not very often you come into 
<A NAME="30"></A>the country to see us herdsmen; you stick pretty close to the town generally. 
<A NAME="31"></A>I suppose you think it better to keep an eye on what the suitors are 
<A NAME="32"></A>doing."
<A NAME="33"></A><BR><BR>"So be it, old friend," answered Telemachus, "but I am come now 
<A NAME="34"></A>because I want to see you, and to learn whether my mother is still at her 
<A NAME="35"></A>old home or whether some one else has married her, so that the bed of Ulysses 
<A NAME="36"></A>is without bedding and covered with cobwebs."
<A NAME="37"></A><BR><BR>"She is still at the house," replied Eumaeus, "grieving and breaking 
<A NAME="38"></A>her heart, and doing nothing but weep, both night and day 
<A NAME="39"></A>continually."
<A NAME="40"></A><BR><BR>As spoke he took Telemachus' spear, whereon he crossed the stone 
<A NAME="41"></A>threshold and came inside. Ulysses rose from his seat to give him place 
<A NAME="42"></A>as he entered, but Telemachus checked him; "Sit down, stranger." said he, 
<A NAME="43"></A>"I can easily find another seat, and there is one here who will lay it 
<A NAME="44"></A>for me."
<A NAME="45"></A><BR><BR>Ulysses went back to his own place, and Eumaeus strewed some green 
<A NAME="46"></A>brushwood on the floor and threw a sheepskin on top of it for Telemachus 
<A NAME="47"></A>to sit upon. Then the swineherd brought them platters of cold meat, the 
<A NAME="48"></A>remains from what they had eaten the day before, and he filled the bread 
<A NAME="49"></A>baskets with bread as fast as he could. He mixed wine also in bowls of 
<A NAME="50"></A>ivy-wood, and took his seat facing Ulysses. Then they laid their hands 
<A NAME="51"></A>on the good things that were before them, and as soon as they had had enough 
<A NAME="52"></A>to eat and drink Telemachus said to Eumaeus, "Old friend, where does this 
<A NAME="53"></A>stranger come from? How did his crew bring him to Ithaca, and who were 
<A NAME="54"></A>they?-for assuredly he did not come here by land"'
<A NAME="55"></A><BR><BR>To this you answered, O swineherd Eumaeus, "My son, I will tell 
<A NAME="56"></A>you the real truth. He says he is a Cretan, and that he has been a great 
<A NAME="57"></A>traveller. At this moment he is running away from a Thesprotian ship, and 
<A NAME="58"></A>has refuge at my station, so I will put him into your hands. Do whatever 
<A NAME="59"></A>you like with him, only remember that he is your suppliant."
<A NAME="60"></A><BR><BR>"I am very much distressed," said Telemachus, "by what you have 
<A NAME="61"></A>just told me. How can I take this stranger into my house? I am as yet young, 
<A NAME="62"></A>and am not strong enough to hold my own if any man attacks me. My mother 
<A NAME="63"></A>cannot make up her mind whether to stay where she is and look after the 
<A NAME="64"></A>house out of respect for public opinion and the memory of her husband, 
<A NAME="65"></A>or whether the time is now come for her to take the best man of those who 
<A NAME="66"></A>are wooing her, and the one who will make her the most advantageous offer; 
<A NAME="67"></A>still, as the stranger has come to your station I will find him a cloak 
<A NAME="68"></A>and shirt of good wear, with a sword and sandals, and will send him wherever 
<A NAME="69"></A>he wants to go. Or if you like you can keep him here at the station, and 
<A NAME="70"></A>I will send him clothes and food that he may be no burden on you and on 
<A NAME="71"></A>your men; but I will not have him go near the suitors, for they are very 
<A NAME="72"></A>insolent, and are sure to ill-treat him in a way that would greatly grieve 
<A NAME="73"></A>me; no matter how valiant a man may be he can do nothing against numbers, 
<A NAME="74"></A>for they will be too strong for him."
<A NAME="75"></A><BR><BR>Then Ulysses said, "Sir, it is right that I should say something 
<A NAME="76"></A>myself. I am much shocked about what you have said about the insolent way 
<A NAME="77"></A>in which the suitors are behaving in despite of such a man as you are. 
<A NAME="78"></A>Tell me, do you submit to such treatment tamely, or has some god set your 
<A NAME="79"></A>people against you? May you not complain of your brothers- for it is to 
<A NAME="80"></A>these that a man may look for support, however great his quarrel may be? 
<A NAME="81"></A>I wish I were as young as you are and in my present mind; if I were son 
<A NAME="82"></A>to Ulysses, or, indeed, Ulysses himself, I would rather some one came and 
<A NAME="83"></A>cut my head off, but I would go to the house and be the bane of every one 
<A NAME="84"></A>of these men. If they were too many for me- I being single-handed- I would 
<A NAME="85"></A>rather die fighting in my own house than see such disgraceful sights day 
<A NAME="86"></A>after day, strangers grossly maltreated, and men dragging the women servants 
<A NAME="87"></A>about the house in an unseemly way, wine drawn recklessly, and bread wasted 
<A NAME="88"></A>all to no purpose for an end that shall never be accomplished."
<A NAME="89"></A><BR><BR>And Telemachus answered, "I will tell you truly everything. There 
<A NAME="90"></A>is no emnity between me and my people, nor can I complain of brothers, 
<A NAME="91"></A>to whom a man may look for support however great his quarrel may be. Jove 
<A NAME="92"></A>has made us a race of only sons. Laertes was the only son of Arceisius, 
<A NAME="93"></A>and Ulysses only son of Laertes. I am myself the only son of Ulysses who 
<A NAME="94"></A>left me behind him when he went away, so that I have never been of any 
<A NAME="95"></A>use to him. Hence it comes that my house is in the hands of numberless 
<A NAME="96"></A>marauders; for the chiefs from all the neighbouring islands, Dulichium, 
<A NAME="97"></A>Same, Zacynthus, as also all the principal men of Ithaca itself, are eating 
<A NAME="98"></A>up my house under the pretext of paying court to my mother, who will neither 
<A NAME="99"></A>say point blank that she will not marry, nor yet bring matters to an end, 
<A NAME="100"></A>so they are making havoc of my estate, and before long will do so with 
<A NAME="101"></A>myself into the bargain. The issue, however, rests with heaven. But do 
<A NAME="102"></A>you, old friend Eumaeus, go at once and tell Penelope that I am safe and 
<A NAME="103"></A>have returned from Pylos. Tell it to herself alone, and then come back 
<A NAME="104"></A>here without letting any one else know, for there are many who are plotting 
<A NAME="105"></A>mischief against me."
<A NAME="106"></A><BR><BR>"I understand and heed you," replied Eumaeus; "you need instruct 
<A NAME="107"></A>me no further, only I am going that way say whether I had not better let 
<A NAME="108"></A>poor Laertes know that you are returned. He used to superintend the work 
<A NAME="109"></A>on his farm in spite of his bitter sorrow about Ulysses, and he would eat 
<A NAME="110"></A>and drink at will along with his servants; but they tell me that from the 
<A NAME="111"></A>day on which you set out for Pylos he has neither eaten nor drunk as he 
<A NAME="112"></A>ought to do, nor does he look after his farm, but sits weeping and wasting 
<A NAME="113"></A>the flesh from off his bones."
<A NAME="114"></A><BR><BR>"More's the pity," answered Telemachus, "I am sorry for him, but 
<A NAME="115"></A>we must leave him to himself just now. If people could have everything 
<A NAME="116"></A>their own way, the first thing I should choose would be the return of my 
<A NAME="117"></A>father; but go, and give your message; then make haste back again, and 
<A NAME="118"></A>do not turn out of your way to tell Laertes. Tell my mother to send one 
<A NAME="119"></A>of her women secretly with the news at once, and let him hear it from 
<A NAME="120"></A>her."
<A NAME="121"></A><BR><BR>Thus did he urge the swineherd; Eumaeus, therefore, took his sandals, 
<A NAME="122"></A>bound them to his feet, and started for the town. Minerva watched him well 
<A NAME="123"></A>off the station, and then came up to it in the form of a woman- fair, stately, 
<A NAME="124"></A>and wise. She stood against the side of the entry, and revealed herself 
<A NAME="125"></A>to Ulysses, but Telemachus could not see her, and knew not that she was 
<A NAME="126"></A>there, for the gods do not let themselves be seen by everybody. Ulysses 
<A NAME="127"></A>saw her, and so did the dogs, for they did not bark, but went scared and 
<A NAME="128"></A>whining off to the other side of the yards. She nodded her head and motioned 
<A NAME="129"></A>to Ulysses with her eyebrows; whereon he left the hut and stood before 
<A NAME="130"></A>her outside the main wall of the yards. Then she said to 
<A NAME="131"></A>him:
<A NAME="132"></A><BR><BR>"Ulysses, noble son of Laertes, it is now time for you to tell 
<A NAME="133"></A>your son: do not keep him in the dark any longer, but lay your plans for 
<A NAME="134"></A>the destruction of the suitors, and then make for the town. I will not 
<A NAME="135"></A>be long in joining you, for I too am eager for the fray."
<A NAME="136"></A><BR><BR>As she spoke she touched him with her golden wand. First she threw 
<A NAME="137"></A>a fair clean shirt and cloak about his shoulders; then she made him younger 
<A NAME="138"></A>and of more imposing presence; she gave him back his colour, filled out 
<A NAME="139"></A>his cheeks, and let his beard become dark again. Then she went away and 
<A NAME="140"></A>Ulysses came back inside the hut. His son was astounded when he saw him, 
<A NAME="141"></A>and turned his eyes away for fear he might be looking upon a 
<A NAME="142"></A>god.
<A NAME="143"></A><BR><BR>"Stranger," said he, "how suddenly you have changed from what you 
<A NAME="144"></A>were a moment or two ago. You are dressed differently and your colour is 
<A NAME="145"></A>not the same. Are you some one or other of the gods that live in heaven? 
<A NAME="146"></A>If so, be propitious to me till I can make you due sacrifice and offerings 
<A NAME="147"></A>of wrought gold. Have mercy upon me."
<A NAME="148"></A><BR><BR>And Ulysses said, "I am no god, why should you take me for one? 
<A NAME="149"></A>I am your father, on whose account you grieve and suffer so much at the 
<A NAME="150"></A>hands of lawless men."
<A NAME="151"></A><BR><BR>As he spoke he kissed his son, and a tear fell from his cheek on 
<A NAME="152"></A>to the ground, for he had restrained all tears till now. but Telemachus 
<A NAME="153"></A>could not yet believe that it was his father, and said:
<A NAME="154"></A><BR><BR>"You are not my father, but some god is flattering me with vain 
<A NAME="155"></A>hopes that I may grieve the more hereafter; no mortal man could of himself 
<A NAME="156"></A>contrive to do as you have been doing, and make yourself old and young 
<A NAME="157"></A>at a moment's notice, unless a god were with him. A second ago you were 
<A NAME="158"></A>old and all in rags, and now you are like some god come down from 
<A NAME="159"></A>heaven."
<A NAME="160"></A><BR><BR>Ulysses answered, "Telemachus, you ought not to be so immeasurably 
<A NAME="161"></A>astonished at my being really here. There is no other Ulysses who will 
<A NAME="162"></A>come hereafter. Such as I am, it is I, who after long wandering and much 
<A NAME="163"></A>hardship have got home in the twentieth year to my own country. What you 
<A NAME="164"></A>wonder at is the work of the redoubtable goddess Minerva, who does with 
<A NAME="165"></A>me whatever she will, for she can do what she pleases. At one moment she 
<A NAME="166"></A>makes me like a beggar, and the next I am a young man with good clothes 
<A NAME="167"></A>on my back; it is an easy matter for the gods who live in heaven to make 
<A NAME="168"></A>any man look either rich or poor."
<A NAME="169"></A><BR><BR>As he spoke he sat down, and Telemachus threw his arms about his 
<A NAME="170"></A>father and wept. They were both so much moved that they cried aloud like 
<A NAME="171"></A>eagles or vultures with crooked talons that have been robbed of their half 
<A NAME="172"></A>fledged young by peasants. Thus piteously did they weep, and the sun would 
<A NAME="173"></A>have gone down upon their mourning if Telemachus had not suddenly said, 
<A NAME="174"></A>"In what ship, my dear father, did your crew bring you to Ithaca? Of what 
<A NAME="175"></A>nation did they declare themselves to be- for you cannot have come by 
<A NAME="176"></A>land?"
<A NAME="177"></A><BR><BR>"I will tell you the truth, my son," replied Ulysses. "It was the 
<A NAME="178"></A>Phaeacians who brought me here. They are great sailors, and are in the 
<A NAME="179"></A>habit of giving escorts to any one who reaches their coasts. They took 
<A NAME="180"></A>me over the sea while I was fast asleep, and landed me in Ithaca, after 
<A NAME="181"></A>giving me many presents in bronze, gold, and raiment. These things by heaven's 
<A NAME="182"></A>mercy are lying concealed in a cave, and I am now come here on the suggestion 
<A NAME="183"></A>of Minerva that we may consult about killing our enemies. First, therefore, 
<A NAME="184"></A>give me a list of the suitors, with their number, that I may learn who, 
<A NAME="185"></A>and how many, they are. I can then turn the matter over in my mind, and 
<A NAME="186"></A>see whether we two can fight the whole body of them ourselves, or whether 
<A NAME="187"></A>we must find others to help us."
<A NAME="188"></A><BR><BR>To this Telemachus answered, "Father, I have always heard of your 
<A NAME="189"></A>renown both in the field and in council, but the task you talk of is a 
<A NAME="190"></A>very great one: I am awed at the mere thought of it; two men cannot stand 
<A NAME="191"></A>against many and brave ones. There are not ten suitors only, nor twice 
<A NAME="192"></A>ten, but ten many times over; you shall learn their number at once. There 
<A NAME="193"></A>are fifty-two chosen youths from Dulichium, and they have six servants; 
<A NAME="194"></A>from Same there are twenty-four; twenty young Achaeans from Zacynthus, 
<A NAME="195"></A>and twelve from Ithaca itself, all of them well born. They have with them 
<A NAME="196"></A>a servant Medon, a bard, and two men who can carve at table. If we face 
<A NAME="197"></A>such numbers as this, you may have bitter cause to rue your coming, and 
<A NAME="198"></A>your revenge. See whether you cannot think of some one who would be willing 
<A NAME="199"></A>to come and help us."
<A NAME="200"></A><BR><BR>"Listen to me," replied Ulysses, "and think whether Minerva and 
<A NAME="201"></A>her father Jove may seem sufficient, or whether I am to try and find some 
<A NAME="202"></A>one else as well."
<A NAME="203"></A><BR><BR>"Those whom you have named," answered Telemachus, "are a couple 
<A NAME="204"></A>of good allies, for though they dwell high up among the clouds they have 
<A NAME="205"></A>power over both gods and men."
<A NAME="206"></A><BR><BR>"These two," continued Ulysses, "will not keep long out of the 
<A NAME="207"></A>fray, when the suitors and we join fight in my house. Now, therefore, return 
<A NAME="208"></A>home early to-morrow morning, and go about among the suitors as before. 
<A NAME="209"></A>Later on the swineherd will bring me to the city disguised as a miserable 
<A NAME="210"></A>old beggar. If you see them ill-treating me, steel your heart against my 
<A NAME="211"></A>sufferings; even though they drag me feet foremost out of the house, or 
<A NAME="212"></A>throw things at me, look on and do nothing beyond gently trying to make 
<A NAME="213"></A>them behave more reasonably; but they will not listen to you, for the day 
<A NAME="214"></A>of their reckoning is at hand. Furthermore I say, and lay my saying to 
<A NAME="215"></A>your heart, when Minerva shall put it in my mind, I will nod my head to 
<A NAME="216"></A>you, and on seeing me do this you must collect all the armour that is in 
<A NAME="217"></A>the house and hide it in the strong store room. Make some excuse when the 
<A NAME="218"></A>suitors ask you why you are removing it; say that you have taken it to 
<A NAME="219"></A>be out of the way of the smoke, inasmuch as it is no longer what it was 
<A NAME="220"></A>when Ulysses went away, but has become soiled and begrimed with soot. Add 
<A NAME="221"></A>to this more particularly that you are afraid Jove may set them on to quarrel 
<A NAME="222"></A>over their wine, and that they may do each other some harm which may disgrace 
<A NAME="223"></A>both banquet and wooing, for the sight of arms sometimes tempts people 
<A NAME="224"></A>to use them. But leave a sword and a spear apiece for yourself and me, 
<A NAME="225"></A>and a couple oxhide shields so that we can snatch them up at any moment; 
<A NAME="226"></A>Jove and Minerva will then soon quiet these people. There is also another 
<A NAME="227"></A>matter; if you are indeed my son and my blood runs in your veins, let no 
<A NAME="228"></A>one know that Ulysses is within the house- neither Laertes, nor yet the 
<A NAME="229"></A>swineherd, nor any of the servants, nor even Penelope herself. Let you 
<A NAME="230"></A>and me exploit the women alone, and let us also make trial of some other 
<A NAME="231"></A>of the men servants, to see who is on our side and whose hand is against 
<A NAME="232"></A>us."
<A NAME="233"></A><BR><BR>"Father," replied Telemachus, "you will come to know me by and 
<A NAME="234"></A>by, and when you do you will find that I can keep your counsel. I do not 
<A NAME="235"></A>think, however, the plan you propose will turn out well for either of us. 
<A NAME="236"></A>Think it over. It will take us a long time to go the round of the farms 
<A NAME="237"></A>and exploit the men, and all the time the suitors will be wasting your 
<A NAME="238"></A>estate with impunity and without compunction. Prove the women by all means, 
<A NAME="239"></A>to see who are disloyal and who guiltless, but I am not in favour of going 
<A NAME="240"></A>round and trying the men. We can attend to that later on, if you really 
<A NAME="241"></A>have some sign from Jove that he will support you."
<A NAME="242"></A><BR><BR>Thus did they converse, and meanwhile the ship which had brought 
<A NAME="243"></A>Telemachus and his crew from Pylos had reached the town of Ithaca. When 
<A NAME="244"></A>they had come inside the harbour they drew the ship on to the land; their 
<A NAME="245"></A>servants came and took their armour from them, and they left all the presents 
<A NAME="246"></A>at the house of Clytius. Then they sent a servant to tell Penelope that 
<A NAME="247"></A>Telemachus had gone into the country, but had sent the ship to the town 
<A NAME="248"></A>to prevent her from being alarmed and made unhappy. This servant and Eumaeus 
<A NAME="249"></A>happened to meet when they were both on the same errand of going to tell 
<A NAME="250"></A>Penelope. When they reached the House, the servant stood up and said to 
<A NAME="251"></A>the queen in the presence of the waiting women, "Your son, Madam, is now 
<A NAME="252"></A>returned from Pylos"; but Eumaeus went close up to Penelope, and said privately 
<A NAME="253"></A>that her son had given bidden him tell her. When he had given his message 
<A NAME="254"></A>he left the house with its outbuildings and went back to his pigs 
<A NAME="255"></A>again.
<A NAME="256"></A><BR><BR>The suitors were surprised and angry at what had happened, so they 
<A NAME="257"></A>went outside the great wall that ran round the outer court, and held a 
<A NAME="258"></A>council near the main entrance. Eurymachus, son of Polybus, was the first 
<A NAME="259"></A>to speak.
<A NAME="260"></A><BR><BR>"My friends," said he, "this voyage of Telemachus's is a very serious 
<A NAME="261"></A>matter; we had made sure that it would come to nothing. Now, however, let 
<A NAME="262"></A>us draw a ship into the water, and get a crew together to send after the 
<A NAME="263"></A>others and tell them to come back as fast as they can."
<A NAME="264"></A><BR><BR>He had hardly done speaking when Amphinomus turned in his place 
<A NAME="265"></A>and saw the ship inside the harbour, with the crew lowering her sails, 
<A NAME="266"></A>and putting by their oars; so he laughed, and said to the others, "We need 
<A NAME="267"></A>not send them any message, for they are here. Some god must have told them, 
<A NAME="268"></A>or else they saw the ship go by, and could not overtake 
<A NAME="269"></A>her.
<A NAME="270"></A><BR><BR>On this they rose and went to the water side. The crew then drew 
<A NAME="271"></A>the ship on shore; their servants took their armour from them, and they 
<A NAME="272"></A>went up in a body to the place of assembly, but they would not let any 
<A NAME="273"></A>one old or young sit along with them, and Antinous, son of Eupeithes, spoke 
<A NAME="274"></A>first.
<A NAME="275"></A><BR><BR>"Good heavens," said he, "see how the gods have saved this man 
<A NAME="276"></A>from destruction. We kept a succession of scouts upon the headlands all 
<A NAME="277"></A>day long, and when the sun was down we never went on shore to sleep, but 
<A NAME="278"></A>waited in the ship all night till morning in the hope of capturing and 
<A NAME="279"></A>killing him; but some god has conveyed him home in spite of us. Let us 
<A NAME="280"></A>consider how we can make an end of him. He must not escape us; our affair 
<A NAME="281"></A>is never likely to come off while is alive, for he is very shrewd, and 
<A NAME="282"></A>public feeling is by no means all on our side. We must make haste before 
<A NAME="283"></A>he can call the Achaeans in assembly; he will lose no time in doing so, 
<A NAME="284"></A>for he will be furious with us, and will tell all the world how we plotted 
<A NAME="285"></A>to kill him, but failed to take him. The people will not like this when 
<A NAME="286"></A>they come to know of it; we must see that they do us no hurt, nor drive 
<A NAME="287"></A>us from our own country into exile. Let us try and lay hold of him either 
<A NAME="288"></A>on his farm away from the town, or on the road hither. Then we can divide 
<A NAME="289"></A>up his property amongst us, and let his mother and the man who marries 
<A NAME="290"></A>her have the house. If this does not please you, and you wish Telemachus 
<A NAME="291"></A>to live on and hold his father's property, then we must not gather here 
<A NAME="292"></A>and eat up his goods in this way, but must make our offers to Penelope 
<A NAME="293"></A>each from his own house, and she can marry the man who will give the most 
<A NAME="294"></A>for her, and whose lot it is to win her."
<A NAME="295"></A><BR><BR>They all held their peace until Amphinomus rose to speak. He was 
<A NAME="296"></A>the son of Nisus, who was son to king Aretias, and he was foremost among 
<A NAME="297"></A>all the suitors from the wheat-growing and well grassed island of Dulichium; 
<A NAME="298"></A>his conversation, moreover, was more agreeable to Penelope than that of 
<A NAME="299"></A>any of the other for he was a man of good natural disposition. "My friends," 
<A NAME="300"></A>said he, speaking to them plainly and in all honestly, "I am not in favour 
<A NAME="301"></A>of killing Telemachus. It is a heinous thing to kill one who is of noble 
<A NAME="302"></A>blood. Let us first take counsel of the gods, and if the oracles of Jove 
<A NAME="303"></A>advise it, I will both help to kill him myself, and will urge everyone 
<A NAME="304"></A>else to do so; but if they dissuade us, I would have you hold your 
<A NAME="305"></A>hands."
<A NAME="306"></A><BR><BR>Thus did he speak, and his words pleased them well, so they rose 
<A NAME="307"></A>forthwith and went to the house of Ulysses where they took their accustomed 
<A NAME="308"></A>seats.
<A NAME="309"></A><BR><BR>Then Penelope resolved that she would show herself to the suitors. 
<A NAME="310"></A>She knew of the plot against Telemachus, for the servant Medon had overheard 
<A NAME="311"></A>their counsels and had told her; she went down therefore to the court attended 
<A NAME="312"></A>by her maidens, and when she reached the suitors she stood by one of the 
<A NAME="313"></A>bearing-posts supporting the roof of the cloister holding a veil before 
<A NAME="314"></A>her face, and rebuked Antinous saying:
<A NAME="315"></A><BR><BR>"Antinous, insolent and wicked schemer, they say you are the best 
<A NAME="316"></A>speaker and counsellor of any man your own age in Ithaca, but you are nothing 
<A NAME="317"></A>of the kind. Madman, why should you try to compass the death of Telemachus, 
<A NAME="318"></A>and take no heed of suppliants, whose witness is Jove himself? It is not 
<A NAME="319"></A>right for you to plot thus against one another. Do you not remember how 
<A NAME="320"></A>your father fled to this house in fear of the people, who were enraged 
<A NAME="321"></A>against him for having gone with some Taphian pirates and plundered the 
<A NAME="322"></A>Thesprotians who were at peace with us? They wanted to tear him in pieces 
<A NAME="323"></A>and eat up everything he had, but Ulysses stayed their hands although they 
<A NAME="324"></A>were infuriated, and now you devour his property without paying for it, 
<A NAME="325"></A>and break my heart by his wooing his wife and trying to kill his son. Leave 
<A NAME="326"></A>off doing so, and stop the others also."
<A NAME="327"></A><BR><BR>To this Eurymachus son of Polybus answered, "Take heart, Queen 
<A NAME="328"></A>Penelope daughter of Icarius, and do not trouble yourself about these matters. 
<A NAME="329"></A>The man is not yet born, nor never will be, who shall lay hands upon your 
<A NAME="330"></A>son Telemachus, while I yet live to look upon the face of the earth. I 
<A NAME="331"></A>say- and it shall surely be- that my spear shall be reddened with his blood; 
<A NAME="332"></A>for many a time has Ulysses taken me on his knees, held wine up to my lips 
<A NAME="333"></A>to drink, and put pieces of meat into my hands. Therefore Telemachus is 
<A NAME="334"></A>much the dearest friend I have, and has nothing to fear from the hands 
<A NAME="335"></A>of us suitors. Of course, if death comes to him from the gods, he cannot 
<A NAME="336"></A>escape it." He said this to quiet her, but in reality he was plotting against 
<A NAME="337"></A>Telemachus.
<A NAME="338"></A><BR><BR>Then Penelope went upstairs again and mourned her husband till 
<A NAME="339"></A>Minerva shed sleep over her eyes. In the evening Eumaeus got back to Ulysses 
<A NAME="340"></A>and his son, who had just sacrificed a young pig of a year old and were 
<A NAME="341"></A>ready; helping one another to get supper ready; Minerva therefore came 
<A NAME="342"></A>up to Ulysses, turned him into an old man with a stroke of her wand, and 
<A NAME="343"></A>clad him in his old clothes again, for fear that the swineherd might recognize 
<A NAME="344"></A>him and not keep the secret, but go and tell Penelope.
<A NAME="345"></A><BR><BR>Telemachus was the first to speak. "So you have got back, Eumaeus," 
<A NAME="346"></A>said he. "What is the news of the town? Have the suitors returned, or are 
<A NAME="347"></A>they still waiting over yonder, to take me on my way 
<A NAME="348"></A>home?"
<A NAME="349"></A><BR><BR>"I did not think of asking about that," replied Eumaeus, "when 
<A NAME="350"></A>I was in the town. I thought I would give my message and come back as soon 
<A NAME="351"></A>as I could. I met a man sent by those who had gone with you to Pylos, and 
<A NAME="352"></A>he was the first to tell the new your mother, but I can say what I saw 
<A NAME="353"></A>with my own eyes; I had just got on to the crest of the hill of Mercury 
<A NAME="354"></A>above the town when I saw a ship coming into harbour with a number of men 
<A NAME="355"></A>in her. They had many shields and spears, and I thought it was the suitors, 
<A NAME="356"></A>but I cannot be sure."
<A NAME="357"></A><BR><BR>On hearing this Telemachus smiled to his father, but so that Eumaeus 
<A NAME="358"></A>could not see him.
<A NAME="359"></A><BR><BR>Then, when they had finished their work and the meal was ready, 
<A NAME="360"></A>they ate it, and every man had his full share so that all were satisfied. 
<A NAME="361"></A>As soon as they had had enough to eat and drink, they laid down to rest 
<A NAME="362"></A>and enjoyed the boon of sleep.
