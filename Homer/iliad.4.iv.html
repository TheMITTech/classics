<A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A>Now the gods were sitting with Jove in council upon the golden floor while 
<A NAME="11"></A>Hebe went round pouring out nectar for them to drink, and as they pledged 
<A NAME="12"></A>one another in their cups of gold they looked down upon the town of Troy. 
<A NAME="13"></A>The son of Saturn then began to tease Juno, talking at her so as to provoke 
<A NAME="14"></A>her. "Menelaus," said he, "has two good friends among the goddesses, Juno 
<A NAME="15"></A>of Argos, and Minerva of Alalcomene, but they only sit still and look on, 
<A NAME="16"></A>while Venus keeps ever by Alexandrus' side to defend him in any danger; 
<A NAME="17"></A>indeed she has just rescued him when he made sure that it was all over 
<A NAME="18"></A>with him- for the victory really did lie with Menelaus. We must consider 
<A NAME="19"></A>what we shall do about all this; shall we set them fighting anew or make 
<A NAME="20"></A>peace between them? If you will agree to this last Menelaus can take back 
<A NAME="21"></A>Helen and the city of Priam may remain still inhabited."
<A NAME="22"></A><BR><BR>Minerva and Juno muttered their discontent as they sat side by 
<A NAME="23"></A>side hatching mischief for the Trojans. Minerva scowled at her father, 
<A NAME="24"></A>for she was in a furious passion with him, and said nothing, but Juno could 
<A NAME="25"></A>not contain herself. "Dread son of Saturn," said she, "what, pray, is the 
<A NAME="26"></A>meaning of all this? Is my trouble, then, to go for nothing, and the sweat 
<A NAME="27"></A>that I have sweated, to say nothing of my horses, while getting the people 
<A NAME="28"></A>together against Priam and his children? Do as you will, but we other gods 
<A NAME="29"></A>shall not all of us approve your counsel."
<A NAME="30"></A><BR><BR>Jove was angry and answered, "My dear, what harm have Priam and 
<A NAME="31"></A>his sons done you that you are so hotly bent on sacking the city of Ilius? 
<A NAME="32"></A>Will nothing do for you but you must within their walls and eat Priam raw, 
<A NAME="33"></A>with his sons and all the other Trojans to boot? Have it your own way then; 
<A NAME="34"></A>for I would not have this matter become a bone of contention between us. 
<A NAME="35"></A>I say further, and lay my saying to your heart, if ever I want to sack 
<A NAME="36"></A>a city belonging to friends of yours, you must not try to stop me; you 
<A NAME="37"></A>will have to let me do it, for I am giving in to you sorely against my 
<A NAME="38"></A>will. Of all inhabited cities under the sun and stars of heaven, there 
<A NAME="39"></A>was none that I so much respected as Ilius with Priam and his whole people. 
<A NAME="40"></A>Equitable feasts were never wanting about my altar, nor the savour of burning 
<A NAME="41"></A>fat, which is honour due to ourselves."
<A NAME="42"></A><BR><BR>"My own three favourite cities," answered Juno, "are Argos, Sparta, 
<A NAME="43"></A>and Mycenae. Sack them whenever you may be displeased with them. I shall 
<A NAME="44"></A>not defend them and I shall not care. Even if I did, and tried to stay 
<A NAME="45"></A>you, I should take nothing by it, for you are much stronger than I am, 
<A NAME="46"></A>but I will not have my own work wasted. I too am a god and of the same 
<A NAME="47"></A>race with yourself. I am Saturn's eldest daughter, and am honourable not 
<A NAME="48"></A>on this ground only, but also because I am your wife, and you are king 
<A NAME="49"></A>over the gods. Let it be a case, then, of give-and-take between us, and 
<A NAME="50"></A>the rest of the gods will follow our lead. Tell Minerva to go and take 
<A NAME="51"></A>part in the fight at once, and let her contrive that the Trojans shall 
<A NAME="52"></A>be the first to break their oaths and set upon the Achaeans."
<A NAME="53"></A><BR><BR>The sire of gods and men heeded her words, and said to Minerva, 
<A NAME="54"></A>"Go at once into the Trojan and Achaean hosts, and contrive that the Trojans 
<A NAME="55"></A>shall be the first to break their oaths and set upon the 
<A NAME="56"></A>Achaeans."
<A NAME="57"></A><BR><BR>This was what Minerva was already eager to do, so down she darted 
<A NAME="58"></A>from the topmost summits of Olympus. She shot through the sky as some brilliant 
<A NAME="59"></A>meteor which the son of scheming Saturn has sent as a sign to mariners 
<A NAME="60"></A>or to some great army, and a fiery train of light follows in its wake. 
<A NAME="61"></A>The Trojans and Achaeans were struck with awe as they beheld, and one would 
<A NAME="62"></A>turn to his neighbour, saying, "Either we shall again have war and din 
<A NAME="63"></A>of combat, or Jove the lord of battle will now make peace between 
<A NAME="64"></A>us."
<A NAME="65"></A><BR><BR>Thus did they converse. Then Minerva took the form of Laodocus, 
<A NAME="66"></A>son of Antenor, and went through the ranks of the Trojans to find Pandarus, 
<A NAME="67"></A>the redoubtable son of Lycaon. She found him standing among the stalwart 
<A NAME="68"></A>heroes who had followed him from the banks of the Aesopus, so she went 
<A NAME="69"></A>close up to him and said, "Brave son of Lycaon, will you do as I tell you? 
<A NAME="70"></A>If you dare send an arrow at Menelaus you will win honour and thanks from 
<A NAME="71"></A>all the Trojans, and especially from prince Alexandrus- he would be the 
<A NAME="72"></A>first to requite you very handsomely if he could see Menelaus mount his 
<A NAME="73"></A>funeral pyre, slain by an arrow from your hand. Take your home aim then, 
<A NAME="74"></A>and pray to Lycian Apollo, the famous archer; vow that when you get home 
<A NAME="75"></A>to your strong city of Zelea you will offer a hecatomb of firstling lambs 
<A NAME="76"></A>in his honour."
<A NAME="77"></A><BR><BR>His fool's heart was persuaded, and he took his bow from its case. 
<A NAME="78"></A>This bow was made from the horns of a wild ibex which he had killed as 
<A NAME="79"></A>it was bounding from a rock; he had stalked it, and it had fallen as the 
<A NAME="80"></A>arrow struck it to the heart. Its horns were sixteen palms long, and a 
<A NAME="81"></A>worker in horn had made them into a bow, smoothing them well down, and 
<A NAME="82"></A>giving them tips of gold. When Pandarus had strung his bow he laid it carefully 
<A NAME="83"></A>on the ground, and his brave followers held their shields before him lest 
<A NAME="84"></A>the Achaeans should set upon him before he had shot Menelaus. Then he opened 
<A NAME="85"></A>the lid of his quiver and took out a winged arrow that had yet been shot, 
<A NAME="86"></A>fraught with the pangs of death. He laid the arrow on the string and prayed 
<A NAME="87"></A>to Lycian Apollo, the famous archer, vowing that when he got home to his 
<A NAME="88"></A>strong city of Zelea he would offer a hecatomb of firstling lambs in his 
<A NAME="89"></A>honour. He laid the notch of the arrow on the oxhide bowstring, and drew 
<A NAME="90"></A>both notch and string to his breast till the arrow-head was near the bow; 
<A NAME="91"></A>then when the bow was arched into a half-circle he let fly, and the bow 
<A NAME="92"></A>twanged, and the string sang as the arrow flew gladly on over the heads 
<A NAME="93"></A>of the throng.
<A NAME="94"></A><BR><BR>But the blessed gods did not forget thee, O Menelaus, and Jove's 
<A NAME="95"></A>daughter, driver of the spoil, was the first to stand before thee and ward 
<A NAME="96"></A>off the piercing arrow. She turned it from his skin as a mother whisks 
<A NAME="97"></A>a fly from off her child when it is sleeping sweetly; she guided it to 
<A NAME="98"></A>the part where the golden buckles of the belt that passed over his double 
<A NAME="99"></A>cuirass were fastened, so the arrow struck the belt that went tightly round 
<A NAME="100"></A>him. It went right through this and through the cuirass of cunning workmanship; 
<A NAME="101"></A>it also pierced the belt beneath it, which he wore next his skin to keep 
<A NAME="102"></A>out darts or arrows; it was this that served him in the best stead, nevertheless 
<A NAME="103"></A>the arrow went through it and grazed the top of the skin, so that blood 
<A NAME="104"></A>began flowing from the wound.
<A NAME="105"></A><BR><BR>As when some woman of Meonia or Caria strains purple dye on to 
<A NAME="106"></A>a piece of ivory that is to be the cheek-piece of a horse, and is to be 
<A NAME="107"></A>laid up in a treasure house- many a knight is fain to bear it, but the 
<A NAME="108"></A>king keeps it as an ornament of which both horse and driver may be proud- 
<A NAME="109"></A>even so, O Menelaus, were your shapely thighs and your legs down to your 
<A NAME="110"></A>fair ancles stained with blood.
<A NAME="111"></A><BR><BR>When King Agamemnon saw the blood flowing from the wound he was 
<A NAME="112"></A>afraid, and so was brave Menelaus himself till he saw that the barbs of 
<A NAME="113"></A>the arrow and the thread that bound the arrow-head to the shaft were still 
<A NAME="114"></A>outside the wound. Then he took heart, but Agamemnon heaved a deep sigh 
<A NAME="115"></A>as he held Menelaus's hand in his own, and his comrades made moan in concert. 
<A NAME="116"></A>"Dear brother, "he cried, "I have been the death of you in pledging this 
<A NAME="117"></A>covenant and letting you come forward as our champion. The Trojans have 
<A NAME="118"></A>trampled on their oaths and have wounded you; nevertheless the oath, the 
<A NAME="119"></A>blood of lambs, the drink-offerings and the right hands of fellowship in 
<A NAME="120"></A>which have put our trust shall not be vain. If he that rules Olympus fulfil 
<A NAME="121"></A>it not here and now, he. will yet fulfil it hereafter, and they shall pay 
<A NAME="122"></A>dearly with their lives and with their wives and children. The day will 
<A NAME="123"></A>surely come when mighty Ilius shall be laid low, with Priam and Priam's 
<A NAME="124"></A>people, when the son of Saturn from his high throne shall overshadow them 
<A NAME="125"></A>with his awful aegis in punishment of their present treachery. This shall 
<A NAME="126"></A>surely be; but how, Menelaus, shall I mourn you, if it be your lot now 
<A NAME="127"></A>to die? I should return to Argos as a by-word, for the Achaeans will at 
<A NAME="128"></A>once go home. We shall leave Priam and the Trojans the glory of still keeping 
<A NAME="129"></A>Helen, and the earth will rot your bones as you lie here at Troy with your 
<A NAME="130"></A>purpose not fulfilled. Then shall some braggart Trojan leap upon your tomb 
<A NAME="131"></A>and say, 'Ever thus may Agamemnon wreak his vengeance; he brought his army 
<A NAME="132"></A>in vain; he is gone home to his own land with empty ships, and has left 
<A NAME="133"></A>Menelaus behind him.' Thus will one of them say, and may the earth then 
<A NAME="134"></A>swallow me."
<A NAME="135"></A><BR><BR>But Menelaus reassured him and said, "Take heart, and do not alarm 
<A NAME="136"></A>the people; the arrow has not struck me in a mortal part, for my outer 
<A NAME="137"></A>belt of burnished metal first stayed it, and under this my cuirass and 
<A NAME="138"></A>the belt of mail which the bronze-smiths made me."
<A NAME="139"></A><BR><BR>And Agamemnon answered, "I trust, dear Menelaus, that it may be 
<A NAME="140"></A>even so, but the surgeon shall examine your wound and lay herbs upon it 
<A NAME="141"></A>to relieve your pain."
<A NAME="142"></A><BR><BR>He then said to Talthybius, "Talthybius, tell Machaon, son to the 
<A NAME="143"></A>great physician, Aesculapius, to come and see Menelaus immediately. Some 
<A NAME="144"></A>Trojan or Lycian archer has wounded him with an arrow to our dismay, and 
<A NAME="145"></A>to his own great glory."
<A NAME="146"></A><BR><BR>Talthybius did as he was told, and went about the host trying to 
<A NAME="147"></A>find Machaon. Presently he found standing amid the brave warriors who had 
<A NAME="148"></A>followed him from Tricca; thereon he went up to him and said, "Son of Aesculapius, 
<A NAME="149"></A>King Agamemnon says you are to come and see Menelaus immediately. Some 
<A NAME="150"></A>Trojan or Lycian archer has wounded him with an arrow to our dismay and 
<A NAME="151"></A>to his own great glory."
<A NAME="152"></A><BR><BR>Thus did he speak, and Machaon was moved to go. They passed through 
<A NAME="153"></A>the spreading host of the Achaeans and went on till they came to the place 
<A NAME="154"></A>where Menelaus had been wounded and was lying with the chieftains gathered 
<A NAME="155"></A>in a circle round him. Machaon passed into the middle of the ring and at 
<A NAME="156"></A>once drew the arrow from the belt, bending its barbs back through the force 
<A NAME="157"></A>with which he pulled it out. He undid the burnished belt, and beneath this 
<A NAME="158"></A>the cuirass and the belt of mail which the bronze-smiths had made; then, 
<A NAME="159"></A>when he had seen the wound, he wiped away the blood and applied some soothing 
<A NAME="160"></A>drugs which Chiron had given to Aesculapius out of the good will he bore 
<A NAME="161"></A>him.
<A NAME="162"></A><BR><BR>While they were thus busy about Menelaus, the Trojans came forward 
<A NAME="163"></A>against them, for they had put on their armour, and now renewed the 
<A NAME="164"></A>fight.
<A NAME="165"></A><BR><BR>You would not have then found Agamemnon asleep nor cowardly and 
<A NAME="166"></A>unwilling to fight, but eager rather for the fray. He left his chariot 
<A NAME="167"></A>rich with bronze and his panting steeds in charge of Eurymedon, son of 
<A NAME="168"></A>Ptolemaeus the son of Peiraeus, and bade him hold them in readiness against 
<A NAME="169"></A>the time his limbs should weary of going about and giving orders to so 
<A NAME="170"></A>many, for he went among the ranks on foot. When he saw men hasting to the 
<A NAME="171"></A>front he stood by them and cheered them on. "Argives," said he, "slacken 
<A NAME="172"></A>not one whit in your onset; father Jove will be no helper of liars; the 
<A NAME="173"></A>Trojans have been the first to break their oaths and to attack us; therefore 
<A NAME="174"></A>they shall be devoured of vultures; we shall take their city and carry 
<A NAME="175"></A>off their wives and children in our ships."
<A NAME="176"></A><BR><BR>But he angrily rebuked those whom he saw shirking and disinclined 
<A NAME="177"></A>to fight. "Argives," he cried, "cowardly miserable creatures, have you 
<A NAME="178"></A>no shame to stand here like frightened fawns who, when they can no longer 
<A NAME="179"></A>scud over the plain, huddle together, but show no fight? You are as dazed 
<A NAME="180"></A>and spiritless as deer. Would you wait till the Trojans reach the sterns 
<A NAME="181"></A>of our ships as they lie on the shore, to see, whether the son of Saturn 
<A NAME="182"></A>will hold his hand over you to protect you?"
<A NAME="183"></A><BR><BR>Thus did he go about giving his orders among the ranks. Passing 
<A NAME="184"></A>through the crowd, he came presently on the Cretans, arming round Idomeneus, 
<A NAME="185"></A>who was at their head, fierce as a wild boar, while Meriones was bringing 
<A NAME="186"></A>up the battalions that were in the rear. Agamemnon was glad when he saw 
<A NAME="187"></A>him, and spoke him fairly. "Idomeneus," said he, "I treat you with greater 
<A NAME="188"></A>distinction than I do any others of the Achaeans, whether in war or in 
<A NAME="189"></A>other things, or at table. When the princes are mixing my choicest wines 
<A NAME="190"></A>in the mixing-bowls, they have each of them a fixed allowance, but your 
<A NAME="191"></A>cup is kept always full like my own, that you may drink whenever you are 
<A NAME="192"></A>minded. Go, therefore, into battle, and show yourself the man you have 
<A NAME="193"></A>been always proud to be."
<A NAME="194"></A><BR><BR>Idomeneus answered, "I will be a trusty comrade, as I promised 
<A NAME="195"></A>you from the first I would be. Urge on the other Achaeans, that we may 
<A NAME="196"></A>join battle at once, for the Trojans have trampled upon their covenants. 
<A NAME="197"></A>Death and destruction shall be theirs, seeing they have been the first 
<A NAME="198"></A>to break their oaths and to attack us."
<A NAME="199"></A><BR><BR>The son of Atreus went on, glad at heart, till he came upon the 
<A NAME="200"></A>two Ajaxes arming themselves amid a host of foot-soldiers. As when a goat-herd 
<A NAME="201"></A>from some high post watches a storm drive over the deep before the west 
<A NAME="202"></A>wind- black as pitch is the offing and a mighty whirlwind draws towards 
<A NAME="203"></A>him, so that he is afraid and drives his flock into a cave- even thus did 
<A NAME="204"></A>the ranks of stalwart youths move in a dark mass to battle under the Ajaxes, 
<A NAME="205"></A>horrid with shield and spear. Glad was King Agamemnon when he saw them. 
<A NAME="206"></A>"No need," he cried, "to give orders to such leaders of the Argives as 
<A NAME="207"></A>you are, for of your own selves you spur your men on to fight with might 
<A NAME="208"></A>and main. Would, by father Jove, Minerva, and Apollo that all were so minded 
<A NAME="209"></A>as you are, for the city of Priam would then soon fall beneath our hands, 
<A NAME="210"></A>and we should sack it."
<A NAME="211"></A><BR><BR>With this he left them and went onward to Nestor, the facile speaker 
<A NAME="212"></A>of the Pylians, who was marshalling his men and urging them on, in company 
<A NAME="213"></A>with Pelagon, Alastor, Chromius, Haemon, and Bias shepherd of his people. 
<A NAME="214"></A>He placed his knights with their chariots and horses in the front rank, 
<A NAME="215"></A>while the foot-soldiers, brave men and many, whom he could trust, were 
<A NAME="216"></A>in the rear. The cowards he drove into the middle, that they might fight 
<A NAME="217"></A>whether they would or no. He gave his orders to the knights first, bidding 
<A NAME="218"></A>them hold their horses well in hand, so as to avoid confusion. "Let no 
<A NAME="219"></A>man," he said, "relying on his strength or horsemanship, get before the 
<A NAME="220"></A>others and engage singly with the Trojans, nor yet let him lag behind or 
<A NAME="221"></A>you will weaken your attack; but let each when he meets an enemy's chariot 
<A NAME="222"></A>throw his spear from his own; this be much the best; this is how the men 
<A NAME="223"></A>of old took towns and strongholds; in this wise were they 
<A NAME="224"></A>minded."
<A NAME="225"></A><BR><BR>Thus did the old man charge them, for he had been in many a fight, 
<A NAME="226"></A>and King Agamemnon was glad. "I wish," he said to him, that your limbs 
<A NAME="227"></A>were as supple and your strength as sure as your judgment is; but age, 
<A NAME="228"></A>the common enemy of mankind, has laid his hand upon you; would that it 
<A NAME="229"></A>had fallen upon some other, and that you were still 
<A NAME="230"></A>young."
<A NAME="231"></A><BR><BR>And Nestor, knight of Gerene, answered, "Son of Atreus, I too would 
<A NAME="232"></A>gladly be the man I was when I slew mighty Ereuthalion; but the gods will 
<A NAME="233"></A>not give us everything at one and the same time. I was then young, and 
<A NAME="234"></A>now I am old; still I can go with my knights and give them that counsel 
<A NAME="235"></A>which old men have a right to give. The wielding of the spear I leave to 
<A NAME="236"></A>those who are younger and stronger than myself."
<A NAME="237"></A><BR><BR>Agamemnon went his way rejoicing, and presently found Menestheus, 
<A NAME="238"></A>son of Peteos, tarrying in his place, and with him were the Athenians loud 
<A NAME="239"></A>of tongue in battle. Near him also tarried cunning Ulysses, with his sturdy 
<A NAME="240"></A>Cephallenians round him; they had not yet heard the battle-cry, for the 
<A NAME="241"></A>ranks of Trojans and Achaeans had only just begun to move, so they were 
<A NAME="242"></A>standing still, waiting for some other columns of the Achaeans to attack 
<A NAME="243"></A>the Trojans and begin the fighting. When he saw this Agamemnon rebuked 
<A NAME="244"></A>them and said, "Son of Peteos, and you other, steeped in cunning, heart 
<A NAME="245"></A>of guile, why stand you here cowering and waiting on others? You two should 
<A NAME="246"></A>be of all men foremost when there is hard fighting to be done, for you 
<A NAME="247"></A>are ever foremost to accept my invitation when we councillors of the Achaeans 
<A NAME="248"></A>are holding feast. You are glad enough then to take your fill of roast 
<A NAME="249"></A>meats and to drink wine as long as you please, whereas now you would not 
<A NAME="250"></A>care though you saw ten columns of Achaeans engage the enemy in front of 
<A NAME="251"></A>you."
<A NAME="252"></A><BR><BR>Ulysses glared at him and answered, "Son of Atreus, what are you 
<A NAME="253"></A>talking about? How can you say that we are slack? When the Achaeans are 
<A NAME="254"></A>in full fight with the Trojans, you shall see, if you care to do so, that 
<A NAME="255"></A>the father of Telemachus will join battle with the foremost of them. You 
<A NAME="256"></A>are talking idly."
<A NAME="257"></A><BR><BR>When Agamemnon saw that Ulysses was angry, he smiled pleasantly 
<A NAME="258"></A>at him and withdrew his words. "Ulysses," said he, "noble son of Laertes, 
<A NAME="259"></A>excellent in all good counsel, I have neither fault to find nor orders 
<A NAME="260"></A>to give you, for I know your heart is right, and that you and I are of 
<A NAME="261"></A>a mind. Enough; I will make you amends for what I have said, and if any 
<A NAME="262"></A>ill has now been spoken may the gods bring it to nothing."
<A NAME="263"></A><BR><BR>He then left them and went on to others. Presently he saw the son 
<A NAME="264"></A>of Tydeus, noble Diomed, standing by his chariot and horses, with Sthenelus 
<A NAME="265"></A>the son of Capaneus beside him; whereon he began to upbraid him. "Son of 
<A NAME="266"></A>Tydeus," he said, "why stand you cowering here upon the brink of battle? 
<A NAME="267"></A>Tydeus did not shrink thus, but was ever ahead of his men when leading 
<A NAME="268"></A>them on against the foe- so, at least, say they that saw him in battle, 
<A NAME="269"></A>for I never set eyes upon him myself. They say that there was no man like 
<A NAME="270"></A>him. He came once to Mycenae, not as an enemy but as a guest, in company 
<A NAME="271"></A>with Polynices to recruit his forces, for they were levying war against 
<A NAME="272"></A>the strong city of Thebes, and prayed our people for a body of picked men 
<A NAME="273"></A>to help them. The men of Mycenae were willing to let them have one, but 
<A NAME="274"></A>Jove dissuaded them by showing them unfavourable omens. Tydeus, therefore, 
<A NAME="275"></A>and Polynices went their way. When they had got as far the deep-meadowed 
<A NAME="276"></A>and rush-grown banks of the Aesopus, the Achaeans sent Tydeus as their 
<A NAME="277"></A>envoy, and he found the Cadmeans gathered in great numbers to a banquet 
<A NAME="278"></A>in the house of Eteocles. Stranger though he was, he knew no fear on finding 
<A NAME="279"></A>himself single-handed among so many, but challenged them to contests of 
<A NAME="280"></A>all kinds, and in each one of them was at once victorious, so mightily 
<A NAME="281"></A>did Minerva help him. The Cadmeans were incensed at his success, and set 
<A NAME="282"></A>a force of fifty youths with two captains- the godlike hero Maeon, son 
<A NAME="283"></A>of Haemon, and Polyphontes, son of Autophonus- at their head, to lie in 
<A NAME="284"></A>wait for him on his return journey; but Tydeus slew every man of them, 
<A NAME="285"></A>save only Maeon, whom he let go in obedience to heaven's omens. Such was 
<A NAME="286"></A>Tydeus of Aetolia. His son can talk more glibly, but he cannot fight as 
<A NAME="287"></A>his father did."
<A NAME="288"></A><BR><BR>Diomed made no answer, for he was shamed by the rebuke of Agamemnon; 
<A NAME="289"></A>but the son of Capaneus took up his words and said, "Son of Atreus, tell 
<A NAME="290"></A>no lies, for you can speak truth if you will. We boast ourselves as even 
<A NAME="291"></A>better men than our fathers; we took seven-gated Thebes, though the wall 
<A NAME="292"></A>was stronger and our men were fewer in number, for we trusted in the omens 
<A NAME="293"></A>of the gods and in the help of Jove, whereas they perished through their 
<A NAME="294"></A>own sheer folly; hold not, then, our fathers in like honour with 
<A NAME="295"></A>us."
<A NAME="296"></A><BR><BR>Diomed looked sternly at him and said, "Hold your peace, my friend, 
<A NAME="297"></A>as I bid you. It is not amiss that Agamemnon should urge the Achaeans forward, 
<A NAME="298"></A>for the glory will be his if we take the city, and his the shame if we 
<A NAME="299"></A>are vanquished. Therefore let us acquit ourselves with 
<A NAME="300"></A>valour."
<A NAME="301"></A><BR><BR>As he spoke he sprang from his chariot, and his armour rang so 
<A NAME="302"></A>fiercely about his body that even a brave man might well have been scared 
<A NAME="303"></A>to hear it.
<A NAME="304"></A><BR><BR>As when some mighty wave that thunders on the beach when the west 
<A NAME="305"></A>wind has lashed it into fury- it has reared its head afar and now comes 
<A NAME="306"></A>crashing down on the shore; it bows its arching crest high over the jagged 
<A NAME="307"></A>rocks and spews its salt foam in all directions- even so did the serried 
<A NAME="308"></A>phalanxes of the Danaans march steadfastly to battle. The chiefs gave orders 
<A NAME="309"></A>each to his own people, but the men said never a word; no man would think 
<A NAME="310"></A>it, for huge as the host was, it seemed as though there was not a tongue 
<A NAME="311"></A>among them, so silent were they in their obedience; and as they marched 
<A NAME="312"></A>the armour about their bodies glistened in the sun. But the clamour of 
<A NAME="313"></A>the Trojan ranks was as that of many thousand ewes that stand waiting to 
<A NAME="314"></A>be milked in the yards of some rich flockmaster, and bleat incessantly 
<A NAME="315"></A>in answer to the bleating of their lambs; for they had not one speech nor 
<A NAME="316"></A>language, but their tongues were diverse, and they came from many different 
<A NAME="317"></A>places. These were inspired of Mars, but the others by Minerva- and with 
<A NAME="318"></A>them came Panic, Rout, and Strife whose fury never tires, sister and friend 
<A NAME="319"></A>of murderous Mars, who, from being at first but low in stature, grows till 
<A NAME="320"></A>she uprears her head to heaven, though her feet are still on earth. She 
<A NAME="321"></A>it was that went about among them and flung down discord to the waxing 
<A NAME="322"></A>of sorrow with even hand between them.
<A NAME="323"></A><BR><BR>When they were got together in one place shield clashed with shield 
<A NAME="324"></A>and spear with spear in the rage of battle. The bossed shields beat one 
<A NAME="325"></A>upon another, and there was a tramp as of a great multitude- death-cry 
<A NAME="326"></A>and shout of triumph of slain and slayers, and the earth ran red with blood. 
<A NAME="327"></A>As torrents swollen with rain course madly down their deep channels till 
<A NAME="328"></A>the angry floods meet in some gorge, and the shepherd the hillside hears 
<A NAME="329"></A>their roaring from afar- even such was the toil and uproar of the hosts 
<A NAME="330"></A>as they joined in battle.
<A NAME="331"></A><BR><BR>First Antilochus slew an armed warrior of the Trojans, Echepolus, 
<A NAME="332"></A>son of Thalysius, fighting in the foremost ranks. He struck at the projecting 
<A NAME="333"></A>part of his helmet and drove the spear into his brow; the point of bronze 
<A NAME="334"></A>pierced the bone, and darkness veiled his eyes; headlong as a tower he 
<A NAME="335"></A>fell amid the press of the fight, and as he dropped King Elephenor, son 
<A NAME="336"></A>of Chalcodon and captain of the proud Abantes began dragging him out of 
<A NAME="337"></A>reach of the darts that were falling around him, in haste to strip him 
<A NAME="338"></A>of his armour. But his purpose was not for long; Agenor saw him haling 
<A NAME="339"></A>the body away, and smote him in the side with his bronze-shod spear- for 
<A NAME="340"></A>as he stooped his side was left unprotected by his shield- and thus he 
<A NAME="341"></A>perished. Then the fight between Trojans and Achaeans grew furious over 
<A NAME="342"></A>his body, and they flew upon each other like wolves, man and man crushing 
<A NAME="343"></A>one upon the other.
<A NAME="344"></A><BR><BR>Forthwith Ajax, son of Telamon, slew the fair youth Simoeisius, 
<A NAME="345"></A>son of Anthemion, whom his mother bore by the banks of the Simois, as she 
<A NAME="346"></A>was coming down from Mt. Ida, where she had been with her parents to see 
<A NAME="347"></A>their flocks. Therefore he was named Simoeisius, but he did not live to 
<A NAME="348"></A>pay his parents for his rearing, for he was cut off untimely by the spear 
<A NAME="349"></A>of mighty Ajax, who struck him in the breast by the right nipple as he 
<A NAME="350"></A>was coming on among the foremost fighters; the spear went right through 
<A NAME="351"></A>his shoulder, and he fell as a poplar that has grown straight and tall 
<A NAME="352"></A>in a meadow by some mere, and its top is thick with branches. Then the 
<A NAME="353"></A>wheelwright lays his axe to its roots that he may fashion a felloe for 
<A NAME="354"></A>the wheel of some goodly chariot, and it lies seasoning by the waterside. 
<A NAME="355"></A>In such wise did Ajax fell to earth Simoeisius, son of Anthemion. Thereon 
<A NAME="356"></A>Antiphus of the gleaming corslet, son of Priam, hurled a spear at Ajax 
<A NAME="357"></A>from amid the crowd and missed him, but he hit Leucus, the brave comrade 
<A NAME="358"></A>of Ulysses, in the groin, as he was dragging the body of Simoeisius over 
<A NAME="359"></A>to the other side; so he fell upon the body and loosed his hold upon it. 
<A NAME="360"></A>Ulysses was furious when he saw Leucus slain, and strode in full armour 
<A NAME="361"></A>through the front ranks till he was quite close; then he glared round about 
<A NAME="362"></A>him and took aim, and the Trojans fell back as he did so. His dart was 
<A NAME="363"></A>not sped in vain, for it struck Democoon, the bastard son of Priam, who 
<A NAME="364"></A>had come to him from Abydos, where he had charge of his father's mares. 
<A NAME="365"></A>Ulysses, infuriated by the death of his comrade, hit him with his spear 
<A NAME="366"></A>on one temple, and the bronze point came through on the other side of his 
<A NAME="367"></A>forehead. Thereon darkness veiled his eyes, and his armour rang rattling 
<A NAME="368"></A>round him as he fell heavily to the ground. Hector, and they that were 
<A NAME="369"></A>in front, then gave round while the Argives raised a shout and drew off 
<A NAME="370"></A>the dead, pressing further forward as they did so. But Apollo looked down 
<A NAME="371"></A>from Pergamus and called aloud to the Trojans, for he was displeased. "Trojans," 
<A NAME="372"></A>he cried, "rush on the foe, and do not let yourselves be thus beaten by 
<A NAME="373"></A>the Argives. Their skins are not stone nor iron that when hit them you 
<A NAME="374"></A>do them no harm. Moreover, Achilles, the son of lovely Thetis, is not fighting, 
<A NAME="375"></A>but is nursing his anger at the ships."
<A NAME="376"></A><BR><BR>Thus spoke the mighty god, crying to them from the city, while 
<A NAME="377"></A>Jove's redoubtable daughter, the Trito-born, went about among the host 
<A NAME="378"></A>of the Achaeans, and urged them forward whenever she beheld them 
<A NAME="379"></A>slackening.
<A NAME="380"></A><BR><BR>Then fate fell upon Diores, son of Amarynceus, for he was struck 
<A NAME="381"></A>by a jagged stone near the ancle of his right leg. He that hurled it was 
<A NAME="382"></A>Peirous, son of Imbrasus, captain of the Thracians, who had come from Aenus; 
<A NAME="383"></A>the bones and both the tendons were crushed by the pitiless stone. He fell 
<A NAME="384"></A>to the ground on his back, and in his death throes stretched out his hands 
<A NAME="385"></A>towards his comrades. But Peirous, who had wounded him, sprang on him and 
<A NAME="386"></A>thrust a spear into his belly, so that his bowels came gushing out upon 
<A NAME="387"></A>the ground, and darkness veiled his eyes. As he was leaving the body, Thoas 
<A NAME="388"></A>of Aetolia struck him in the chest near the nipple, and the point fixed 
<A NAME="389"></A>itself in his lungs. Thoas came close up to him, pulled the spear out of 
<A NAME="390"></A>his chest, and then drawing his sword, smote him in the middle of the belly 
<A NAME="391"></A>so that he died; but he did not strip him of his armour, for his Thracian 
<A NAME="392"></A>comrades, men who wear their hair in a tuft at the top of their heads, 
<A NAME="393"></A>stood round the body and kept him off with their long spears for all his 
<A NAME="394"></A>great stature and valour; so he was driven back. Thus the two corpses lay 
<A NAME="395"></A>stretched on earth near to one another, the one captain of the Thracians 
<A NAME="396"></A>and the other of the Epeans; and many another fell round 
<A NAME="397"></A>them.
<A NAME="398"></A><BR><BR>And now no man would have made light of the fighting if he could 
<A NAME="399"></A>have gone about among it scatheless and unwounded, with Minerva leading 
<A NAME="400"></A>him by the hand, and protecting him from the storm of spears and arrows. 
<A NAME="401"></A>For many Trojans and Achaeans on that day lay stretched side by side face 
<A NAME="402"></A>downwards upon the earth.
