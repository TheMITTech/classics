<A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A>Thus the Trojans in the city, scared like fawns, wiped the sweat from off 
<A NAME="11"></A>them and drank to quench their thirst, leaning against the goodly battlements, 
<A NAME="12"></A>while the Achaeans with their shields laid upon their shoulders drew close 
<A NAME="13"></A>up to the walls. But stern fate bade Hector stay where he was before Ilius 
<A NAME="14"></A>and the Scaean gates. Then Phoebus Apollo spoke to the son of Peleus saying, 
<A NAME="15"></A>"Why, son of Peleus, do you, who are but man, give chase to me who am immortal? 
<A NAME="16"></A>Have you not yet found out that it is a god whom you pursue so furiously? 
<A NAME="17"></A>You did not harass the Trojans whom you had routed, and now they are within 
<A NAME="18"></A>their walls, while you have been decoyed hither away from them. Me you 
<A NAME="19"></A>cannot kill, for death can take no hold upon me."
<A NAME="20"></A><BR><BR>Achilles was greatly angered and said, "You have baulked me, Far-Darter, 
<A NAME="21"></A>most malicious of all gods, and have drawn me away from the wall, where 
<A NAME="22"></A>many another man would have bitten the dust ere he got within Ilius; you 
<A NAME="23"></A>have robbed me of great glory and have saved the Trojans at no risk to 
<A NAME="24"></A>yourself, for you have nothing to fear, but I would indeed have my revenge 
<A NAME="25"></A>if it were in my power to do so."
<A NAME="26"></A><BR><BR>On this, with fell intent he made towards the city, and as the 
<A NAME="27"></A>winning horse in a chariot race strains every nerve when he is flying over 
<A NAME="28"></A>the plain, even so fast and furiously did the limbs of Achilles bear him 
<A NAME="29"></A>onwards. King Priam was first to note him as he scoured the plain, all 
<A NAME="30"></A>radiant as the star which men call Orion's Hound, and whose beams blaze 
<A NAME="31"></A>forth in time of harvest more brilliantly than those of any other that 
<A NAME="32"></A>shines by night; brightest of them all though he be, he yet bodes ill for 
<A NAME="33"></A>mortals, for he brings fire and fever in his train- even so did Achilles' 
<A NAME="34"></A>armour gleam on his breast as he sped onwards. Priam raised a cry and beat 
<A NAME="35"></A>his head with his hands as he lifted them up and shouted out to his dear 
<A NAME="36"></A>son, imploring him to return; but Hector still stayed before the gates, 
<A NAME="37"></A>for his heart was set upon doing battle with Achilles. The old man reached 
<A NAME="38"></A>out his arms towards him and bade him for pity's sake come within the walls. 
<A NAME="39"></A>"Hector," he cried, "my son, stay not to face this man alone and unsupported, 
<A NAME="40"></A>or you will meet death at the hands of the son of Peleus, for he is mightier 
<A NAME="41"></A>than you. Monster that he is; would indeed that the gods loved him no better 
<A NAME="42"></A>than I do, for so, dogs and vultures would soon devour him as he lay stretched 
<A NAME="43"></A>on earth, and a load of grief would be lifted from my heart, for many a 
<A NAME="44"></A>brave son has he reft from me, either by killing them or selling them away 
<A NAME="45"></A>in the islands that are beyond the sea: even now I miss two sons from among 
<A NAME="46"></A>the Trojans who have thronged within the city, Lycaon and Polydorus, whom 
<A NAME="47"></A>Laothoe peeress among women bore me. Should they be still alive and in 
<A NAME="48"></A>the hands of the Achaeans, we will ransom them with gold and bronze, of 
<A NAME="49"></A>which we have store, for the old man Altes endowed his daughter richly; 
<A NAME="50"></A>but if they are already dead and in the house of Hades, sorrow will it 
<A NAME="51"></A>be to us two who were their parents; albeit the grief of others will be 
<A NAME="52"></A>more short-lived unless you too perish at the hands of Achilles. Come, 
<A NAME="53"></A>then, my son, within the city, to be the guardian of Trojan men and Trojan 
<A NAME="54"></A>women, or you will both lose your own life and afford a mighty triumph 
<A NAME="55"></A>to the son of Peleus. Have pity also on your unhappy father while life 
<A NAME="56"></A>yet remains to him- on me, whom the son of Saturn will destroy by a terrible 
<A NAME="57"></A>doom on the threshold of old age, after I have seen my sons slain and my 
<A NAME="58"></A>daughters haled away as captives, my bridal chambers pillaged, little children 
<A NAME="59"></A>dashed to earth amid the rage of battle, and my sons' wives dragged away 
<A NAME="60"></A>by the cruel hands of the Achaeans; in the end fierce hounds will tear 
<A NAME="61"></A>me in pieces at my own gates after some one has beaten the life out of 
<A NAME="62"></A>my body with sword or spear-hounds that I myself reared and fed at my own 
<A NAME="63"></A>table to guard my gates, but who will yet lap my blood and then lie all 
<A NAME="64"></A>distraught at my doors. When a young man falls by the sword in battle, 
<A NAME="65"></A>he may lie where he is and there is nothing unseemly; let what will be 
<A NAME="66"></A>seen, all is honourable in death, but when an old man is slain there is 
<A NAME="67"></A>nothing in this world more pitiable than that dogs should defile his grey 
<A NAME="68"></A>hair and beard and all that men hide for shame."
<A NAME="69"></A><BR><BR>The old man tore his grey hair as he spoke, but he moved not the 
<A NAME="70"></A>heart of Hector. His mother hard by wept and moaned aloud as she bared 
<A NAME="71"></A>her bosom and pointed to the breast which had suckled him. "Hector," she 
<A NAME="72"></A>cried, weeping bitterly the while, "Hector, my son, spurn not this breast, 
<A NAME="73"></A>but have pity upon me too: if I have ever given you comfort from my own 
<A NAME="74"></A>bosom, think on it now, dear son, and come within the wall to protect us 
<A NAME="75"></A>from this man; stand not without to meet him. Should the wretch kill you, 
<A NAME="76"></A>neither I nor your richly dowered wife shall ever weep, dear offshoot of 
<A NAME="77"></A>myself, over the bed on which you lie, for dogs will devour you at the 
<A NAME="78"></A>ships of the Achaeans."
<A NAME="79"></A><BR><BR>Thus did the two with many tears implore their son, but they moved 
<A NAME="80"></A>not the heart of Hector, and he stood his ground awaiting huge Achilles 
<A NAME="81"></A>as he drew nearer towards him. As serpent in its den upon the mountains, 
<A NAME="82"></A>full fed with deadly poisons, waits for the approach of man- he is filled 
<A NAME="83"></A>with fury and his eyes glare terribly as he goes writhing round his den- 
<A NAME="84"></A>even so Hector leaned his shield against a tower that jutted out from the 
<A NAME="85"></A>wall and stood where he was, undaunted.
<A NAME="86"></A><BR><BR>"Alas," said he to himself in the heaviness of his heart, "if I 
<A NAME="87"></A>go within the gates, Polydamas will be the first to heap reproach upon 
<A NAME="88"></A>me, for it was he that urged me to lead the Trojans back to the city on 
<A NAME="89"></A>that awful night when Achilles again came forth against us. I would not 
<A NAME="90"></A>listen, but it would have been indeed better if I had done so. Now that 
<A NAME="91"></A>my folly has destroyed the host, I dare not look Trojan men and Trojan 
<A NAME="92"></A>women in the face, lest a worse man should say, 'Hector has ruined us by 
<A NAME="93"></A>his self-confidence.' Surely it would be better for me to return after 
<A NAME="94"></A>having fought Achilles and slain him, or to die gloriously here before 
<A NAME="95"></A>the city. What, again, if were to lay down my shield and helmet, lean my 
<A NAME="96"></A>spear against the wall and go straight up to noble Achilles? What if I 
<A NAME="97"></A>were to promise to give up Helen, who was the fountainhead of all this 
<A NAME="98"></A>war, and all the treasure that Alexandrus brought with him in his ships 
<A NAME="99"></A>to Troy, aye, and to let the Achaeans divide the half of everything that 
<A NAME="100"></A>the city contains among themselves? I might make the Trojans, by the mouths 
<A NAME="101"></A>of their princes, take a solemn oath that they would hide nothing, but 
<A NAME="102"></A>would divide into two shares all that is within the city- but why argue 
<A NAME="103"></A>with myself in this way? Were I to go up to him he would show me no kind 
<A NAME="104"></A>of mercy; he would kill me then and there as easily as though I were a 
<A NAME="105"></A>woman, when I had off my armour. There is no parleying with him from some 
<A NAME="106"></A>rock or oak tree as young men and maidens prattle with one another. Better 
<A NAME="107"></A>fight him at once, and learn to which of us Jove will vouchsafe 
<A NAME="108"></A>victory."
<A NAME="109"></A><BR><BR>Thus did he stand and ponder, but Achilles came up to him as it 
<A NAME="110"></A>were Mars himself, plumed lord of battle. From his right shoulder he brandished 
<A NAME="111"></A>his terrible spear of Pelian ash, and the bronze gleamed around him like 
<A NAME="112"></A>flashing fire or the rays of the rising sun. Fear fell upon Hector as he 
<A NAME="113"></A>beheld him, and he dared not stay longer where he was but fled in dismay 
<A NAME="114"></A>from before the gates, while Achilles darted after him at his utmost speed. 
<A NAME="115"></A>As a mountain falcon, swiftest of all birds, swoops down upon some cowering 
<A NAME="116"></A>dove- the dove flies before him but the falcon with a shrill scream follows 
<A NAME="117"></A>close after, resolved to have her- even so did Achilles make straight for 
<A NAME="118"></A>Hector with all his might, while Hector fled under the Trojan wall as fast 
<A NAME="119"></A>as his limbs could take him.
<A NAME="120"></A><BR><BR>On they flew along the waggon-road that ran hard by under the wall, 
<A NAME="121"></A>past the lookout station, and past the weather-beaten wild fig-tree, till 
<A NAME="122"></A>they came to two fair springs which feed the river Scamander. One of these 
<A NAME="123"></A>two springs is warm, and steam rises from it as smoke from a burning fire, 
<A NAME="124"></A>but the other even in summer is as cold as hail or snow, or the ice that 
<A NAME="125"></A>forms on water. Here, hard by the springs, are the goodly washing-troughs 
<A NAME="126"></A>of stone, where in the time of peace before the coming of the Achaeans 
<A NAME="127"></A>the wives and fair daughters of the Trojans used to wash their clothes. 
<A NAME="128"></A>Past these did they fly, the one in front and the other giving ha. behind 
<A NAME="129"></A>him: good was the man that fled, but better far was he that followed after, 
<A NAME="130"></A>and swiftly indeed did they run, for the prize was no mere beast for sacrifice 
<A NAME="131"></A>or bullock's hide, as it might be for a common foot-race, but they ran 
<A NAME="132"></A>for the life of Hector. As horses in a chariot race speed round the turning-posts 
<A NAME="133"></A>when they are running for some great prize- a tripod or woman- at the games 
<A NAME="134"></A>in honour of some dead hero, so did these two run full speed three times 
<A NAME="135"></A>round the city of Priam. All the gods watched them, and the sire of gods 
<A NAME="136"></A>and men was the first to speak.
<A NAME="137"></A><BR><BR>"Alas," said he, "my eyes behold a man who is dear to me being 
<A NAME="138"></A>pursued round the walls of Troy; my heart is full of pity for Hector, who 
<A NAME="139"></A>has burned the thigh-bones of many a heifer in my honour, at one while 
<A NAME="140"></A>on the of many-valleyed Ida, and again on the citadel of Troy; and now 
<A NAME="141"></A>I see noble Achilles in full pursuit of him round the city of Priam. What 
<A NAME="142"></A>say you? Consider among yourselves and decide whether we shall now save 
<A NAME="143"></A>him or let him fall, valiant though he be, before Achilles, son of 
<A NAME="144"></A>Peleus."
<A NAME="145"></A><BR><BR>Then Minerva said, "Father, wielder of the lightning, lord of cloud 
<A NAME="146"></A>and storm, what mean you? Would you pluck this mortal whose doom has long 
<A NAME="147"></A>been decreed out of the jaws of death? Do as you will, but we others shall 
<A NAME="148"></A>not be of a mind with you."
<A NAME="149"></A><BR><BR>And Jove answered, "My child, Trito-born, take heart. I did not 
<A NAME="150"></A>speak in full earnest, and I will let you have your way. Do without let 
<A NAME="151"></A>or hindrance as you are minded."
<A NAME="152"></A><BR><BR>Thus did he urge Minerva who was already eager, and down she darted 
<A NAME="153"></A>from the topmost summits of Olympus.
<A NAME="154"></A><BR><BR>Achilles was still in full pursuit of Hector, as a hound chasing 
<A NAME="155"></A>a fawn which he has started from its covert on the mountains, and hunts 
<A NAME="156"></A>through glade and thicket. The fawn may try to elude him by crouching under 
<A NAME="157"></A>cover of a bush, but he will scent her out and follow her up until he gets 
<A NAME="158"></A>her- even so there was no escape for Hector from the fleet son of Peleus. 
<A NAME="159"></A>Whenever he made a set to get near the Dardanian gates and under the walls, 
<A NAME="160"></A>that his people might help him by showering down weapons from above, Achilles 
<A NAME="161"></A>would gain on him and head him back towards the plain, keeping himself 
<A NAME="162"></A>always on the city side. As a man in a dream who fails to lay hands upon 
<A NAME="163"></A>another whom he is pursuing- the one cannot escape nor the other overtake- 
<A NAME="164"></A>even so neither could Achilles come up with Hector, nor Hector break away 
<A NAME="165"></A>from Achilles; nevertheless he might even yet have escaped death had not 
<A NAME="166"></A>the time come when Apollo, who thus far had sustained his strength and 
<A NAME="167"></A>nerved his running, was now no longer to stay by him. Achilles made signs 
<A NAME="168"></A>to the Achaean host, and shook his head to show that no man was to aim 
<A NAME="169"></A>a dart at Hector, lest another might win the glory of having hit him and 
<A NAME="170"></A>he might himself come in second. Then, at last, as they were nearing the 
<A NAME="171"></A>fountains for the fourth time, the father of all balanced his golden scales 
<A NAME="172"></A>and placed a doom in each of them, one for Achilles and the other for Hector. 
<A NAME="173"></A>As he held the scales by the middle, the doom of Hector fell down deep 
<A NAME="174"></A>into the house of Hades- and then Phoebus Apollo left him. Thereon Minerva 
<A NAME="175"></A>went close up to the son of Peleus and said, "Noble Achilles, favoured 
<A NAME="176"></A>of heaven, we two shall surely take back to the ships a triumph for the 
<A NAME="177"></A>Achaeans by slaying Hector, for all his lust of battle. Do what Apollo 
<A NAME="178"></A>may as he lies grovelling before his father, aegis-bearing Jove, Hector 
<A NAME="179"></A>cannot escape us longer. Stay here and take breath, while I go up to him 
<A NAME="180"></A>and persuade him to make a stand and fight you."
<A NAME="181"></A><BR><BR>Thus spoke Minerva. Achilles obeyed her gladly, and stood still, 
<A NAME="182"></A>leaning on his bronze-pointed ashen spear, while Minerva left him and went 
<A NAME="183"></A>after Hector in the form and with the voice of Deiphobus. She came close 
<A NAME="184"></A>up to him and said, "Dear brother, I see you are hard pressed by Achilles 
<A NAME="185"></A>who is chasing you at full speed round the city of Priam, let us await 
<A NAME="186"></A>his onset and stand on our defence."
<A NAME="187"></A><BR><BR>And Hector answered, "Deiphobus, you have always been dearest to 
<A NAME="188"></A>me of all my brothers, children of Hecuba and Priam, but henceforth I shall 
<A NAME="189"></A>rate you yet more highly, inasmuch as you have ventured outside the wall 
<A NAME="190"></A>for my sake when all the others remain inside."
<A NAME="191"></A><BR><BR>Then Minerva said, "Dear brother, my father and mother went down 
<A NAME="192"></A>on their knees and implored me, as did all my comrades, to remain inside, 
<A NAME="193"></A>so great a fear has fallen upon them all; but I was in an agony of grief 
<A NAME="194"></A>when I beheld you; now, therefore, let us two make a stand and fight, and 
<A NAME="195"></A>let there be no keeping our spears in reserve, that we may learn whether 
<A NAME="196"></A>Achilles shall kill us and bear off our spoils to the ships, or whether 
<A NAME="197"></A>he shall fall before you."
<A NAME="198"></A><BR><BR>Thus did Minerva inveigle him by her cunning, and when the two 
<A NAME="199"></A>were now close to one another great Hector was first to speak. "I will-no 
<A NAME="200"></A>longer fly you, son of Peleus," said he, "as I have been doing hitherto. 
<A NAME="201"></A>Three times have I fled round the mighty city of Priam, without daring 
<A NAME="202"></A>to withstand you, but now, let me either slay or be slain, for I am in 
<A NAME="203"></A>the mind to face you. Let us, then, give pledges to one another by our 
<A NAME="204"></A>gods, who are the fittest witnesses and guardians of all covenants; let 
<A NAME="205"></A>it be agreed between us that if Jove vouchsafes me the longer stay and 
<A NAME="206"></A>I take your life, I am not to treat your dead body in any unseemly fashion, 
<A NAME="207"></A>but when I have stripped you of your armour, I am to give up your body 
<A NAME="208"></A>to the Achaeans. And do you likewise."
<A NAME="209"></A><BR><BR>Achilles glared at him and answered, "Fool, prate not to me about 
<A NAME="210"></A>covenants. There can be no covenants between men and lions, wolves and 
<A NAME="211"></A>lambs can never be of one mind, but hate each other out and out an through. 
<A NAME="212"></A>Therefore there can be no understanding between you and me, nor may there 
<A NAME="213"></A>be any covenants between us, till one or other shall fall and glut grim 
<A NAME="214"></A>Mars with his life's blood. Put forth all your strength; you have need 
<A NAME="215"></A>now to prove yourself indeed a bold soldier and man of war. You have no 
<A NAME="216"></A>more chance, and Pallas Minerva will forthwith vanquish you by my spear: 
<A NAME="217"></A>you shall now pay me in full for the grief you have caused me on account 
<A NAME="218"></A>of my comrades whom you have killed in battle."
<A NAME="219"></A><BR><BR>He poised his spear as he spoke and hurled it. Hector saw it coming 
<A NAME="220"></A>and avoided it; he watched it and crouched down so that it flew over his 
<A NAME="221"></A>head and stuck in the ground beyond; Minerva then snatched it up and gave 
<A NAME="222"></A>it back to Achilles without Hector's seeing her; Hector thereon said to 
<A NAME="223"></A>the son of Peleus, "You have missed your aim, Achilles, peer of the gods, 
<A NAME="224"></A>and Jove has not yet revealed to you the hour of my doom, though you made 
<A NAME="225"></A>sure that he had done so. You were a false-tongued liar when you deemed 
<A NAME="226"></A>that I should forget my valour and quail before you. You shall not drive 
<A NAME="227"></A>spear into the back of a runaway- drive it, should heaven so grant you 
<A NAME="228"></A>power, drive it into me as I make straight towards you; and now for your 
<A NAME="229"></A>own part avoid my spear if you can- would that you might receive the whole 
<A NAME="230"></A>of it into your body; if you were once dead the Trojans would find the 
<A NAME="231"></A>war an easier matter, for it is you who have harmed them 
<A NAME="232"></A>most."
<A NAME="233"></A><BR><BR>He poised his spear as he spoke and hurled it. His aim was true 
<A NAME="234"></A>for he hit the middle of Achilles' shield, but the spear rebounded from 
<A NAME="235"></A>it, and did not pierce it. Hector was angry when he saw that the weapon 
<A NAME="236"></A>had sped from his hand in vain, and stood there in dismay for he had no 
<A NAME="237"></A>second spear. With a loud cry he called Diphobus and asked him for one, 
<A NAME="238"></A>but there was no man; then he saw the truth and said to himself, "Alas! 
<A NAME="239"></A>the gods have lured me on to my destruction. I deemed that the hero Deiphobus 
<A NAME="240"></A>was by my side, but he is within the wall, and Minerva has inveigled me; 
<A NAME="241"></A>death is now indeed exceedingly near at hand and there is no way out of 
<A NAME="242"></A>it- for so Jove and his son Apollo the far-darter have willed it, though 
<A NAME="243"></A>heretofore they have been ever ready to protect me. My doom has come upon 
<A NAME="244"></A>me; let me not then die ingloriously and without a struggle, but let me 
<A NAME="245"></A>first do some great thing that shall be told among men 
<A NAME="246"></A>hereafter."
<A NAME="247"></A><BR><BR>As he spoke he drew the keen blade that hung so great and strong 
<A NAME="248"></A>by his side, and gathering himself together be sprang on Achilles like 
<A NAME="249"></A>a soaring eagle which swoops down from the clouds on to some lamb or timid 
<A NAME="250"></A>hare- even so did Hector brandish his sword and spring upon Achilles. Achilles 
<A NAME="251"></A>mad with rage darted towards him, with his wondrous shield before his breast, 
<A NAME="252"></A>and his gleaming helmet, made with four layers of metal, nodding fiercely 
<A NAME="253"></A>forward. The thick tresses of gold wi which Vulcan had crested the helmet 
<A NAME="254"></A>floated round it, and as the evening star that shines brighter than all 
<A NAME="255"></A>others through the stillness of night, even such was the gleam of the spear 
<A NAME="256"></A>which Achilles poised in his right hand, fraught with the death of noble 
<A NAME="257"></A>Hector. He eyed his fair flesh over and over to see where he could best 
<A NAME="258"></A>wound it, but all was protected by the goodly armour of which Hector had 
<A NAME="259"></A>spoiled Patroclus after he had slain him, save only the throat where the 
<A NAME="260"></A>collar-bones divide the neck from the shoulders, and this is a most deadly 
<A NAME="261"></A>place: here then did Achilles strike him as he was coming on towards him, 
<A NAME="262"></A>and the point of his spear went right through the fleshy part of the neck, 
<A NAME="263"></A>but it did not sever his windpipe so that he could still speak. Hector 
<A NAME="264"></A>fell headlong, and Achilles vaunted over him saying, "Hector, you deemed 
<A NAME="265"></A>that you should come off scatheless when you were spoiling Patroclus, and 
<A NAME="266"></A>recked not of myself who was not with him. Fool that you were: for I, his 
<A NAME="267"></A>comrade, mightier far than he, was still left behind him at the ships, 
<A NAME="268"></A>and now I have laid you low. The Achaeans shall give him all due funeral 
<A NAME="269"></A>rites, while dogs and vultures shall work their will upon 
<A NAME="270"></A>yourself."
<A NAME="271"></A><BR><BR>Then Hector said, as the life ebbed out of him, "I pray you by 
<A NAME="272"></A>your life and knees, and by your parents, let not dogs devour me at the 
<A NAME="273"></A>ships of the Achaeans, but accept the rich treasure of gold and bronze 
<A NAME="274"></A>which my father and mother will offer you, and send my body home, that 
<A NAME="275"></A>the Trojans and their wives may give me my dues of fire when I am 
<A NAME="276"></A>dead."
<A NAME="277"></A><BR><BR>Achilles glared at him and answered, "Dog, talk not to me neither 
<A NAME="278"></A>of knees nor parents; would that I could be as sure of being able to cut 
<A NAME="279"></A>your flesh into pieces and eat it raw, for the ill have done me, as I am 
<A NAME="280"></A>that nothing shall save you from the dogs- it shall not be, though they 
<A NAME="281"></A>bring ten or twenty-fold ransom and weigh it out for me on the spot, with 
<A NAME="282"></A>promise of yet more hereafter. Though Priam son of Dardanus should bid 
<A NAME="283"></A>them offer me your weight in gold, even so your mother shall never lay 
<A NAME="284"></A>you out and make lament over the son she bore, but dogs and vultures shall 
<A NAME="285"></A>eat you utterly up."
<A NAME="286"></A><BR><BR>Hector with his dying breath then said, "I know you what you are, 
<A NAME="287"></A>and was sure that I should not move you, for your heart is hard as iron; 
<A NAME="288"></A>look to it that I bring not heaven's anger upon you on the day when Paris 
<A NAME="289"></A>and Phoebus Apollo, valiant though you be, shall slay you at the Scaean 
<A NAME="290"></A>gates."
<A NAME="291"></A><BR><BR>When he had thus said the shrouds of death enfolded him, whereon 
<A NAME="292"></A>his soul went out of him and flew down to the house of Hades, lamenting 
<A NAME="293"></A>its sad fate that it should en' youth and strength no longer. But Achilles 
<A NAME="294"></A>said, speaking to the dead body, "Die; for my part I will accept my fate 
<A NAME="295"></A>whensoever Jove and the other gods see fit to send it."
<A NAME="296"></A><BR><BR>As he spoke he drew his spear from the body and set it on one side; 
<A NAME="297"></A>then he stripped the blood-stained armour from Hector's shoulders while 
<A NAME="298"></A>the other Achaeans came running up to view his wondrous strength and beauty; 
<A NAME="299"></A>and no one came near him without giving him a fresh wound. Then would one 
<A NAME="300"></A>turn to his neighbour and say, "It is easier to handle Hector now than 
<A NAME="301"></A>when he was flinging fire on to our ships" and as he spoke he would thrust 
<A NAME="302"></A>his spear into him anew.
<A NAME="303"></A><BR><BR>When Achilles had done spoiling Hector of his armour, he stood 
<A NAME="304"></A>among the Argives and said, "My friends, princes and counsellors of the 
<A NAME="305"></A>Argives, now that heaven has vouchsafed us to overcome this man, who has 
<A NAME="306"></A>done us more hurt than all the others together, consider whether we should 
<A NAME="307"></A>not attack the city in force, and discover in what mind the Trojans may 
<A NAME="308"></A>be. We should thus learn whether they will desert their city now that Hector 
<A NAME="309"></A>has fallen, or will still hold out even though he is no longer living. 
<A NAME="310"></A>But why argue with myself in this way, while Patroclus is still lying at 
<A NAME="311"></A>the ships unburied, and unmourned- he Whom I can never forget so long as 
<A NAME="312"></A>I am alive and my strength fails not? Though men forget their dead when 
<A NAME="313"></A>once they are within the house of Hades, yet not even there will I forget 
<A NAME="314"></A>the comrade whom I have lost. Now, therefore, Achaean youths, let us raise 
<A NAME="315"></A>the song of victory and go back to the ships taking this man along with 
<A NAME="316"></A>us; for we have achieved a mighty triumph and have slain noble Hector to 
<A NAME="317"></A>whom the Trojans prayed throughout their city as though he were a 
<A NAME="318"></A>god."
<A NAME="319"></A><BR><BR>On this he treated the body of Hector with contumely: he pierced 
<A NAME="320"></A>the sinews at the back of both his feet from heel to ancle and passed thongs 
<A NAME="321"></A>of ox-hide through the slits he had made: thus he made the body fast to 
<A NAME="322"></A>his chariot, letting the head trail upon the ground. Then when he had put 
<A NAME="323"></A>the goodly armour on the chariot and had himself mounted, he lashed his 
<A NAME="324"></A>horses on and they flew forward nothing loth. The dust rose from Hector 
<A NAME="325"></A>as he was being dragged along, his dark hair flew all abroad, and his head 
<A NAME="326"></A>once so comely was laid low on earth, for Jove had now delivered him into 
<A NAME="327"></A>the hands of his foes to do him outrage in his own land.
<A NAME="328"></A><BR><BR>Thus was the head of Hector being dishonoured in the dust. His 
<A NAME="329"></A>mother tore her hair, and flung her veil from her with a loud cry as she 
<A NAME="330"></A>looked upon her son. His father made piteous moan, and throughout the city 
<A NAME="331"></A>the people fell to weeping and wailing. It was as though the whole of frowning 
<A NAME="332"></A>Ilius was being smirched with fire. Hardly could the people hold Priam 
<A NAME="333"></A>back in his hot haste to rush without the gates of the city. He grovelled 
<A NAME="334"></A>in the mire and besought them, calling each one of them by his name. "Let 
<A NAME="335"></A>be, my friends," he cried, "and for all your sorrow, suffer me to go single-handed 
<A NAME="336"></A>to the ships of the Achaeans. Let me beseech this cruel and terrible man, 
<A NAME="337"></A>if maybe he will respect the feeling of his fellow-men, and have compassion 
<A NAME="338"></A>on my old age. His own father is even such another as myself- Peleus, who 
<A NAME="339"></A>bred him and reared him to- be the bane of us Trojans, and of myself more 
<A NAME="340"></A>than of all others. Many a son of mine has he slain in the flower of his 
<A NAME="341"></A>youth, and yet, grieve for these as I may, I do so for one- Hector- more 
<A NAME="342"></A>than for them all, and the bitterness of my sorrow will bring me down to 
<A NAME="343"></A>the house of Hades. Would that he had died in my arms, for so both his 
<A NAME="344"></A>ill-starred mother who bore him, and myself, should have had the comfort 
<A NAME="345"></A>of weeping and mourning over him."
<A NAME="346"></A><BR><BR>Thus did he speak with many tears, and all the people of the city 
<A NAME="347"></A>joined in his lament. Hecuba then raised the cry of wailing among the Trojans. 
<A NAME="348"></A>"Alas, my son," she cried, "what have I left to live for now that you are 
<A NAME="349"></A>no more? Night and day did I glory in. you throughout the city, for you 
<A NAME="350"></A>were a tower of strength to all in Troy, and both men and women alike hailed 
<A NAME="351"></A>you as a god. So long as you lived you were their pride, but now death 
<A NAME="352"></A>and destruction have fallen upon you."
<A NAME="353"></A><BR><BR>Hector's wife had as yet heard nothing, for no one had come to 
<A NAME="354"></A>tell her that her husband had remained without the gates. She was at her 
<A NAME="355"></A>loom in an inner part of the house, weaving a double purple web, and embroidering 
<A NAME="356"></A>it with many flowers. She told her maids to set a large tripod on the fire, 
<A NAME="357"></A>so as to have a warm bath ready for Hector when he came out of battle; 
<A NAME="358"></A>poor woman, she knew not that he was now beyond the reach of baths, and 
<A NAME="359"></A>that Minerva had laid him low by the hands of Achilles. She heard the cry 
<A NAME="360"></A>coming as from the wall, and trembled in every limb; the shuttle fell from 
<A NAME="361"></A>her hands, and again she spoke to her waiting-women. "Two of you," she 
<A NAME="362"></A>said, "come with me that I may learn what it is that has befallen; I heard 
<A NAME="363"></A>the voice of my husband's honoured mother; my own heart beats as though 
<A NAME="364"></A>it would come into my mouth and my limbs refuse to carry me; some great 
<A NAME="365"></A>misfortune for Priam's children must be at hand. May I never live to hear 
<A NAME="366"></A>it, but I greatly fear that Achilles has cut off the retreat of brave Hector 
<A NAME="367"></A>and has chased him on to the plain where he was singlehanded; I fear he 
<A NAME="368"></A>may have put an end to the reckless daring which possessed my husband, 
<A NAME="369"></A>who would never remain with the body of his men, but would dash on far 
<A NAME="370"></A>in front, foremost of them all in valour."
<A NAME="371"></A><BR><BR>Her heart beat fast, and as she spoke she flew from the house like 
<A NAME="372"></A>a maniac, with her waiting-women following after. When she reached the 
<A NAME="373"></A>battlements and the crowd of people, she stood looking out upon the wall, 
<A NAME="374"></A>and saw Hector being borne away in front of the city- the horses dragging 
<A NAME="375"></A>him without heed or care over the ground towards the ships of the Achaeans. 
<A NAME="376"></A>Her eyes were then shrouded as with the darkness of night and she fell 
<A NAME="377"></A>fainting backwards. She tore the tiring from her head and flung it from 
<A NAME="378"></A>her, the frontlet and net with its plaited band, and the veil which golden 
<A NAME="379"></A>Venus had given her on the day when Hector took her with him from the house 
<A NAME="380"></A>of Eetion, after having given countless gifts of wooing for her sake. Her 
<A NAME="381"></A>husband's sisters and the wives of his brothers crowded round her and supported 
<A NAME="382"></A>her, for she was fain to die in her distraction; when she again presently 
<A NAME="383"></A>breathed and came to herself, she sobbed and made lament among the Trojans 
<A NAME="384"></A>saying, 'Woe is me, O Hector; woe, indeed, that to share a common lot we 
<A NAME="385"></A>were born, you at Troy in the house of Priam, and I at Thebes under the 
<A NAME="386"></A>wooded mountain of Placus in the house of Eetion who brought me up when 
<A NAME="387"></A>I was a child- ill-starred sire of an ill-starred daughter- would that 
<A NAME="388"></A>he had never begotten me. You are now going into the house of Hades under 
<A NAME="389"></A>the secret places of the earth, and you leave me a sorrowing widow in your 
<A NAME="390"></A>house. The child, of whom you and I are the unhappy parents, is as yet 
<A NAME="391"></A>a mere infant. Now that you are gone, O Hector, you can do nothing for 
<A NAME="392"></A>him nor he for you. Even though he escape the horrors of this woful war 
<A NAME="393"></A>with the Achaeans, yet shall his life henceforth be one of labour and sorrow, 
<A NAME="394"></A>for others will seize his lands. The day that robs a child of his parents 
<A NAME="395"></A>severs him from his own kind; his head is bowed, his cheeks are wet with 
<A NAME="396"></A>tears, and he will go about destitute among the friends of his father, 
<A NAME="397"></A>plucking one by the cloak and another by the shirt. Some one or other of 
<A NAME="398"></A>these may so far pity him as to hold the cup for a moment towards him and 
<A NAME="399"></A>let him moisten his lips, but he must not drink enough to wet the roof 
<A NAME="400"></A>of his mouth; then one whose parents are alive will drive him from the 
<A NAME="401"></A>table with blows and angry words. 'Out with you,' he will say, 'you have 
<A NAME="402"></A>no father here,' and the child will go crying back to his widowed mother- 
<A NAME="403"></A>he, Astyanax, who erewhile would sit upon his father's knees, and have 
<A NAME="404"></A>none but the daintiest and choicest morsels set before him. When he had 
<A NAME="405"></A>played till he was tired and went to sleep, he would lie in a bed, in the 
<A NAME="406"></A>arms of his nurse, on a soft couch, knowing neither want nor care, whereas 
<A NAME="407"></A>now that he has lost his father his lot will be full of hardship- he, whom 
<A NAME="408"></A>the Trojans name Astyanax, because you, O Hector, were the only defence 
<A NAME="409"></A>of their gates and battlements. The wriggling writhing worms will now eat 
<A NAME="410"></A>you at the ships, far from your parents, when the dogs have glutted themselves 
<A NAME="411"></A>upon you. You will lie naked, although in your house you have fine and 
<A NAME="412"></A>goodly raiment made by hands of women. This will I now burn; it is of no 
<A NAME="413"></A>use to you, for you can never again wear it, and thus you will have respect 
<A NAME="414"></A>shown you by the Trojans both men and women."
<A NAME="415"></A><BR><BR>In such wise did she cry aloud amid her tears, and the women joined 
<A NAME="416"></A>in her lament.

<A NAME="end"></A>
