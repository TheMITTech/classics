<A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A>Thus did they fight about the ship of Protesilaus. Then Patroclus drew 
<A NAME="11"></A>near to Achilles with tears welling from his eyes, as from some spring 
<A NAME="12"></A>whose crystal stream falls over the ledges of a high precipice. When Achilles 
<A NAME="13"></A>saw him thus weeping he was sorry for him and said, "Why, Patroclus, do 
<A NAME="14"></A>you stand there weeping like some silly child that comes running to her 
<A NAME="15"></A>mother, and begs to be taken up and carried- she catches hold of her mother's 
<A NAME="16"></A>dress to stay her though she is in a hurry, and looks tearfully up until 
<A NAME="17"></A>her mother carries her- even such tears, Patroclus, are you now shedding. 
<A NAME="18"></A>Have you anything to say to the Myrmidons or to myself? or have you had 
<A NAME="19"></A>news from Phthia which you alone know? They tell me Menoetius son of Actor 
<A NAME="20"></A>is still alive, as also Peleus son of Aeacus, among the Myrmidons- men 
<A NAME="21"></A>whose loss we two should bitterly deplore; or are you grieving about the 
<A NAME="22"></A>Argives and the way in which they are being killed at the ships, throu 
<A NAME="23"></A>their own high-handed doings? Do not hide anything from me but tell me 
<A NAME="24"></A>that both of us may know about it."
<A NAME="25"></A><BR><BR>Then, O knight Patroclus, with a deep sigh you answered, "Achilles, 
<A NAME="26"></A>son of Peleus, foremost champion of the Achaeans, do not be angry, but 
<A NAME="27"></A>I weep for the disaster that has now befallen the Argives. All those who 
<A NAME="28"></A>have been their champions so far are lying at the ships, wounded by sword 
<A NAME="29"></A>or spear. Brave Diomed son of Tydeus has been hit with a spear, while famed 
<A NAME="30"></A>Ulysses and Agamemnon have received sword-wounds; Eurypylus again has been 
<A NAME="31"></A>struck with an arrow in the thigh; skilled apothecaries are attending to 
<A NAME="32"></A>these heroes, and healing them of their wounds; are you still, O Achilles, 
<A NAME="33"></A>so inexorable? May it never be my lot to nurse such a passion as you have 
<A NAME="34"></A>done, to the baning of your own good name. Who in future story will speak 
<A NAME="35"></A>well of you unless you now save the Argives from ruin? You know no pity; 
<A NAME="36"></A>knight Peleus was not your father nor Thetis your mother, but the grey 
<A NAME="37"></A>sea bore you and the sheer cliffs begot you, so cruel and remorseless are 
<A NAME="38"></A>you. If however you are kept back through knowledge of some oracle, or 
<A NAME="39"></A>if your mother Thetis has told you something from the mouth of Jove, at 
<A NAME="40"></A>least send me and the Myrmidons with me, if I may bring deliverance to 
<A NAME="41"></A>the Danaans. Let me moreover wear your armour; the Trojans may thus mistake 
<A NAME="42"></A>me for you and quit the field, so that the hard-pressed sons of the Achaeans 
<A NAME="43"></A>may have breathing time- which while they are fighting may hardly be. We 
<A NAME="44"></A>who are fresh might soon drive tired men back from our ships and tents 
<A NAME="45"></A>to their own city."
<A NAME="46"></A><BR><BR>He knew not what he was asking, nor that he was suing for his own 
<A NAME="47"></A>destruction. Achilles was deeply moved and answered, "What, noble Patroclus, 
<A NAME="48"></A>are you saying? I know no prophesyings which I am heeding, nor has my mother 
<A NAME="49"></A>told me anything from the mouth of Jove, but I am cut to the very heart 
<A NAME="50"></A>that one of my own rank should dare to rob me because he is more powerful 
<A NAME="51"></A>than I am. This, after all that I have gone through, is more than I can 
<A NAME="52"></A>endure. The girl whom the sons of the Achaeans chose for me, whom I won 
<A NAME="53"></A>as the fruit of my spear on having sacked a city- her has King Agamemnon 
<A NAME="54"></A>taken from me as though I were some common vagrant. Still, let bygones 
<A NAME="55"></A>be bygones: no man may keep his anger for ever; I said I would not relent 
<A NAME="56"></A>till battle and the cry of war had reached my own ships; nevertheless, 
<A NAME="57"></A>now gird my armour about your shoulders, and lead the Myrmidons to battle, 
<A NAME="58"></A>for the dark cloud of Trojans has burst furiously over our fleet; the Argives 
<A NAME="59"></A>are driven back on to the beach, cooped within a narrow space, and the 
<A NAME="60"></A>whole people of Troy has taken heart to sally out against them, because 
<A NAME="61"></A>they see not the visor of my helmet gleaming near them. Had they seen this, 
<A NAME="62"></A>there would not have been a creek nor grip that had not been filled with 
<A NAME="63"></A>their dead as they fled back again. And so it would have been, if only 
<A NAME="64"></A>King Agamemnon had dealt fairly by me. As it is the Trojans have beset 
<A NAME="65"></A>our host. Diomed son of Tydeus no longer wields his spear to defend the 
<A NAME="66"></A>Danaans, neither have I heard the voice of the son of Atreus coming from 
<A NAME="67"></A>his hated head, whereas that of murderous Hector rings in my cars as he 
<A NAME="68"></A>gives orders to the Trojans, who triumph over the Achaeans and fill the 
<A NAME="69"></A>whole plain with their cry of battle. But even so, Patroclus, fall upon 
<A NAME="70"></A>them and save the fleet, lest the Trojans fire it and prevent us from being 
<A NAME="71"></A>able to return. Do, however, as I now bid you, that you may win me great 
<A NAME="72"></A>honour from all the Danaans, and that they may restore the girl to me again 
<A NAME="73"></A>and give me rich gifts into the bargain. When you have driven the Trojans 
<A NAME="74"></A>from the ships, come back again. Though Juno's thundering husband should 
<A NAME="75"></A>put triumph within your reach, do not fight the Trojans further in my absence, 
<A NAME="76"></A>or you will rob me of glory that should be mine. And do not for lust of 
<A NAME="77"></A>battle go on killing the Trojans nor lead the Achaeans on to Ilius, lest 
<A NAME="78"></A>one of the ever-living gods from Olympus attack you- for Phoebus Apollo 
<A NAME="79"></A>loves them well: return when you have freed the ships from peril, and let 
<A NAME="80"></A>others wage war upon the plain. Would, by father Jove, Minerva, and Apollo, 
<A NAME="81"></A>that not a single man of all the Trojans might be left alive, nor yet of 
<A NAME="82"></A>the Argives, but that we two might be alone left to tear aside the mantle 
<A NAME="83"></A>that veils the brow of Troy."
<A NAME="84"></A><BR><BR>Thus did they converse. But Ajax could no longer hold his ground 
<A NAME="85"></A>for the shower of darts that rained upon him; the will of Jove and the 
<A NAME="86"></A>javelins of the Trojans were too much for him; the helmet that gleamed 
<A NAME="87"></A>about his temples rang with the continuous clatter of the missiles that 
<A NAME="88"></A>kept pouring on to it and on to the cheek-pieces that protected his face. 
<A NAME="89"></A>Moreover his left shoulder was tired with having held his shield so long, 
<A NAME="90"></A>yet for all this, let fly at him as they would, they could not make him 
<A NAME="91"></A>give ground. He could hardly draw his breath, the sweat rained from every 
<A NAME="92"></A>pore of his body, he had not a moment's respite, and on all sides he was 
<A NAME="93"></A>beset by danger upon danger.
<A NAME="94"></A><BR><BR>And now, tell me, O Muses that hold your mansions on Olympus, how 
<A NAME="95"></A>fire was thrown upon the ships of the Achaeans. Hector came close up and 
<A NAME="96"></A>let drive with his great sword at the ashen spear of Ajax. He cut it clean 
<A NAME="97"></A>in two just behind where the point was fastened on to the shaft of the 
<A NAME="98"></A>spear. Ajax, therefore, had now nothing but a headless spear, while the 
<A NAME="99"></A>bronze point flew some way off and came ringing down on to the ground. 
<A NAME="100"></A>Ajax knew the hand of heaven in this, and was dismayed at seeing that Jove 
<A NAME="101"></A>had now left him utterly defenceless and was willing victory for the Trojans. 
<A NAME="102"></A>Therefore he drew back, and the Trojans flung fire upon the ship which 
<A NAME="103"></A>was at once wrapped in flame.
<A NAME="104"></A><BR><BR>The fire was now flaring about the ship's stern, whereon Achilles 
<A NAME="105"></A>smote his two thighs and said to Patroclus, "Up, noble knight, for I see 
<A NAME="106"></A>the glare of hostile fire at our fleet; up, lest they destroy our ships, 
<A NAME="107"></A>and there be no way by which we may retreat. Gird on your armour at once 
<A NAME="108"></A>while I call our people together."
<A NAME="109"></A><BR><BR>As he spoke Patroclus put on his armour. First he greaved his legs 
<A NAME="110"></A>with greaves of good make, and fitted with ancle-clasps of silver; after 
<A NAME="111"></A>this he donned the cuirass of the son of Aeacus, richly inlaid and studded. 
<A NAME="112"></A>He hung his silver-studded sword of bronze about his shoulders, and then 
<A NAME="113"></A>his mighty shield. On his comely head he set his helmet, well wrought, 
<A NAME="114"></A>with a crest of horse-hair that nodded menacingly above it. He grasped 
<A NAME="115"></A>two redoubtable spears that suited his hands, but he did not take the spear 
<A NAME="116"></A>of noble Achilles, so stout and strong, for none other of the Achaeans 
<A NAME="117"></A>could wield it, though Achilles could do so easily. This was the ashen 
<A NAME="118"></A>spear from Mount Pelion, which Chiron had cut upon a mountain top and had 
<A NAME="119"></A>given to Peleus, wherewith to deal out death among heroes. He bade Automedon 
<A NAME="120"></A>yoke his horses with all speed, for he was the man whom he held in honour 
<A NAME="121"></A>next after Achilles, and on whose support in battle he could rely most 
<A NAME="122"></A>firmly. Automedon therefore yoked the fleet horses Xanthus and Balius, 
<A NAME="123"></A>steeds that could fly like the wind: these were they whom the harpy Podarge 
<A NAME="124"></A>bore to the west wind, as she was grazing in a meadow by the waters of 
<A NAME="125"></A>the river Oceanus. In the side traces he set the noble horse Pedasus, whom 
<A NAME="126"></A>Achilles had brought away with him when he sacked the city of Eetion, and 
<A NAME="127"></A>who, mortal steed though he was, could take his place along with those 
<A NAME="128"></A>that were immortal.
<A NAME="129"></A><BR><BR>Meanwhile Achilles went about everywhere among the tents, and bade 
<A NAME="130"></A>his Myrmidons put on their armour. Even as fierce ravening wolves that 
<A NAME="131"></A>are feasting upon a homed stag which they have killed upon the mountains, 
<A NAME="132"></A>and their jaws are red with blood- they go in a pack to lap water from 
<A NAME="133"></A>the clear spring with their long thin tongues; and they reek of blood and 
<A NAME="134"></A>slaughter; they know not what fear is, for it is hunger drives them- even 
<A NAME="135"></A>so did the leaders and counsellors of the Myrmidons gather round the good 
<A NAME="136"></A>squire of the fleet descendant of Aeacus, and among them stood Achilles 
<A NAME="137"></A>himself cheering on both men and horses.
<A NAME="138"></A><BR><BR>Fifty ships had noble Achilles brought to Troy, and in each there 
<A NAME="139"></A>was a crew of fifty oarsmen. Over these he set five captains whom he could 
<A NAME="140"></A>trust, while he was himself commander over them all. Menesthius of the 
<A NAME="141"></A>gleaming corslet, son to the river Spercheius that streams from heaven, 
<A NAME="142"></A>was captain of the first company. Fair Polydora daughter of Peleus bore 
<A NAME="143"></A>him to ever-flowing Spercheius- a woman mated with a god- but he was called 
<A NAME="144"></A>son of Borus son of Perieres, with whom his mother was living as his wedded 
<A NAME="145"></A>wife, and who gave great wealth to gain her. The second company was led 
<A NAME="146"></A>by noble Eudorus, son to an unwedded woman. Polymele, daughter of Phylas 
<A NAME="147"></A>the graceful dancer, bore him; the mighty slayer of Argos was enamoured 
<A NAME="148"></A>of her as he saw her among the singing women at a dance held in honour 
<A NAME="149"></A>of Diana the rushing huntress of the golden arrows; he therefore- Mercury, 
<A NAME="150"></A>giver of all good- went with her into an upper chamber, and lay with her 
<A NAME="151"></A>in secret, whereon she bore him a noble son Eudorus, singularly fleet of 
<A NAME="152"></A>foot and in fight valiant. When Ilithuia goddess of the pains of child-birth 
<A NAME="153"></A>brought him to the light of day, and he saw the face of the sun, mighty 
<A NAME="154"></A>Echecles son of Actor took the mother to wife, and gave great wealth to 
<A NAME="155"></A>gain her, but her father Phylas brought the child up, and took care of 
<A NAME="156"></A>him, doting as fondly upon him as though he were his own son. The third 
<A NAME="157"></A>company was led by Pisander son of Maemalus, the finest spearman among 
<A NAME="158"></A>all the Myrmidons next to Achilles' own comrade Patroclus. The old knight 
<A NAME="159"></A>Phoenix was captain of the fourth company, and Alcimedon, noble son of 
<A NAME="160"></A>Laerceus of the fifth.
<A NAME="161"></A><BR><BR>When Achilles had chosen his men and had stationed them all with 
<A NAME="162"></A>their captains, he charged them straitly saying, "Myrmidons, remember your 
<A NAME="163"></A>threats against the Trojans while you were at the ships in the time of 
<A NAME="164"></A>my anger, and you were all complaining of me. 'Cruel son of Peleus,' you 
<A NAME="165"></A>would say, 'your mother must have suckled you on gall, so ruthless are 
<A NAME="166"></A>you. You keep us here at the ships against our will; if you are so relentless 
<A NAME="167"></A>it were better we went home over the sea.' Often have you gathered and 
<A NAME="168"></A>thus chided with me. The hour is now come for those high feats of arms 
<A NAME="169"></A>that you have so long been pining for, therefore keep high hearts each 
<A NAME="170"></A>one of you to do battle with the Trojans."
<A NAME="171"></A><BR><BR>With these words he put heart and soul into them all, and they 
<A NAME="172"></A>serried their companies yet more closely when they heard the of their king. 
<A NAME="173"></A>As the stones which a builder sets in the wall of some high house which 
<A NAME="174"></A>is to give shelter from the winds- even so closely were the helmets and 
<A NAME="175"></A>bossed shields set against one another. Shield pressed on shield, helm 
<A NAME="176"></A>on helm, and man on man; so close were they that the horse-hair plumes 
<A NAME="177"></A>on the gleaming ridges of their helmets touched each other as they bent 
<A NAME="178"></A>their heads.
<A NAME="179"></A><BR><BR>In front of them all two men put on their armour- Patroclus and 
<A NAME="180"></A>Automedon- two men, with but one mind to lead the Myrmidons. Then Achilles 
<A NAME="181"></A>went inside his tent and opened the lid of the strong chest which silver-footed 
<A NAME="182"></A>Thetis had given him to take on board ship, and which she had filled with 
<A NAME="183"></A>shirts, cloaks to keep out the cold, and good thick rugs. In this chest 
<A NAME="184"></A>he had a cup of rare workmanship, from which no man but himself might drink, 
<A NAME="185"></A>nor would he make offering from it to any other god save only to father 
<A NAME="186"></A>Jove. He took the cup from the chest and cleansed it with sulphur; this 
<A NAME="187"></A>done he rinsed it clean water, and after he had washed his hands he drew 
<A NAME="188"></A>wine. Then he stood in the middle of the court and prayed, looking towards 
<A NAME="189"></A>heaven, and making his drink-offering of wine; nor was he unseen of Jove 
<A NAME="190"></A>whose joy is in thunder. "King Jove," he cried, "lord of Dodona, god of 
<A NAME="191"></A>the Pelasgi, who dwellest afar, you who hold wintry Dodona in your sway, 
<A NAME="192"></A>where your prophets the Selli dwell around you with their feet unwashed 
<A NAME="193"></A>and their couches made upon the ground- if you heard me when I prayed to 
<A NAME="194"></A>you aforetime, and did me honour while you sent disaster on the Achaeans, 
<A NAME="195"></A>vouchsafe me now the fulfilment of yet this further prayer. I shall stay 
<A NAME="196"></A>here where my ships are lying, but I shall send my comrade into battle 
<A NAME="197"></A>at the head of many Myrmidons. Grant, O all-seeing Jove, that victory may 
<A NAME="198"></A>go with him; put your courage into his heart that Hector may learn whether 
<A NAME="199"></A>my squire is man enough to fight alone, or whether his might is only then 
<A NAME="200"></A>so indomitable when I myself enter the turmoil of war. Afterwards when 
<A NAME="201"></A>he has chased the fight and the cry of battle from the ships, grant that 
<A NAME="202"></A>he may return unharmed, with his armour and his comrades, fighters in close 
<A NAME="203"></A>combat."
<A NAME="204"></A><BR><BR>Thus did he pray, and all-counselling Jove heard his prayer. Part 
<A NAME="205"></A>of it he did indeed vouchsafe him- but not the whole. He granted that Patroclus 
<A NAME="206"></A>should thrust back war and battle from the ships, but refused to let him 
<A NAME="207"></A>come safely out of the fight.
<A NAME="208"></A><BR><BR>When he had made his drink-offering and had thus prayed, Achilles 
<A NAME="209"></A>went inside his tent and put back the cup into his chest.
<A NAME="210"></A><BR><BR>Then he again came out, for he still loved to look upon the fierce 
<A NAME="211"></A>fight that raged between the Trojans and Achaeans.
<A NAME="212"></A><BR><BR>Meanwhile the armed band that was about Patroclus marched on till 
<A NAME="213"></A>they sprang high in hope upon the Trojans. They came swarming out like 
<A NAME="214"></A>wasps whose nests are by the roadside, and whom silly children love to 
<A NAME="215"></A>tease, whereon any one who happens to be passing may get stung- or again, 
<A NAME="216"></A>if a wayfarer going along the road vexes them by accident, every wasp will 
<A NAME="217"></A>come flying out in a fury to defend his little ones- even with such rage 
<A NAME="218"></A>and courage did the Myrmidons swarm from their ships, and their cry of 
<A NAME="219"></A>battle rose heavenwards. Patroclus called out to his men at the top of 
<A NAME="220"></A>his voice, "Myrmidons, followers of Achilles son of Peleus, be men my friends, 
<A NAME="221"></A>fight with might and with main, that we may win glory for the son of Peleus, 
<A NAME="222"></A>who is far the foremost man at the ships of the Argives- he, and his close 
<A NAME="223"></A>fighting followers. The son of Atreus King Agamemnon will thus learn his 
<A NAME="224"></A>folly in showing no respect to the bravest of the Achaeans."
<A NAME="225"></A><BR><BR>With these words he put heart and soul into them all, and they 
<A NAME="226"></A>fell in a body upon the Trojans. The ships rang again with the cry which 
<A NAME="227"></A>the Achaeans raised, and when the Trojans saw the brave son of Menoetius 
<A NAME="228"></A>and his squire all gleaming in their armour, they were daunted and their 
<A NAME="229"></A>battalions were thrown into confusion, for they thought the fleet son of 
<A NAME="230"></A>Peleus must now have put aside his anger, and have been reconciled to Agamemnon; 
<A NAME="231"></A>every one, therefore, looked round about to see whither he might fly for 
<A NAME="232"></A>safety.
<A NAME="233"></A><BR><BR>Patroclus first aimed a spear into the middle of the press where 
<A NAME="234"></A>men were packed most closely, by the stern of the ship of Protesilaus. 
<A NAME="235"></A>He hit Pyraechmes who had led his Paeonian horsemen from the Amydon and 
<A NAME="236"></A>the broad waters of the river Axius; the spear struck him on the right 
<A NAME="237"></A>shoulder, and with a groan he fell backwards in the dust; on this his men 
<A NAME="238"></A>were thrown into confusion, for by killing their leader, who was the finest 
<A NAME="239"></A>soldier among them, Patroclus struck panic into them all. He thus drove 
<A NAME="240"></A>them from the ship and quenched the fire that was then blazing- leaving 
<A NAME="241"></A>the half-burnt ship to lie where it was. The Trojans were now driven back 
<A NAME="242"></A>with a shout that rent the skies, while the Danaans poured after them from 
<A NAME="243"></A>their ships, shouting also without ceasing. As when Jove, gatherer of the 
<A NAME="244"></A>thunder-cloud, spreads a dense canopy on the top of some lofty mountain, 
<A NAME="245"></A>and all the peaks, the jutting headlands, and forest glades show out in 
<A NAME="246"></A>the great light that flashes from the bursting heavens, even so when the 
<A NAME="247"></A>Danaans had now driven back the fire from their ships, they took breath 
<A NAME="248"></A>for a little while; but the fury of the fight was not yet over, for the 
<A NAME="249"></A>Trojans were not driven back in utter rout, but still gave battle, and 
<A NAME="250"></A>were ousted from their ground only by sheer fighting.
<A NAME="251"></A><BR><BR>The fight then became more scattered, and the chieftains killed 
<A NAME="252"></A>one another when and how they could. The valiant son of Menoetius first 
<A NAME="253"></A>drove his spear into the thigh of Areilycus just as he was turning round; 
<A NAME="254"></A>the point went clean through, and broke the bone so that he fell forward. 
<A NAME="255"></A>Meanwhile Menelaus struck Thoas in the chest, where it was exposed near 
<A NAME="256"></A>the rim of his shield, and he fell dead. The son of Phyleus saw Amphiclus 
<A NAME="257"></A>about to attack him, and ere he could do so took aim at the upper part 
<A NAME="258"></A>of his thigh, where the muscles are thicker than in any other part; the 
<A NAME="259"></A>spear tore through all the sinews of the leg, and his eyes were closed 
<A NAME="260"></A>in darkness. Of the sons of Nestor one, Antilochus, speared Atymnius, driving 
<A NAME="261"></A>the point of the spear through his throat, and down he fell. Maris then 
<A NAME="262"></A>sprang on Antilochus in hand-to-hand fight to avenge his brother, and bestrode 
<A NAME="263"></A>the body spear in hand; but valiant Thrasymedes was too quick for him, 
<A NAME="264"></A>and in a moment had struck him in the shoulder ere he could deal his blow; 
<A NAME="265"></A>his aim was true, and the spear severed all the muscles at the root of 
<A NAME="266"></A>his arm, and tore them right down to the bone, so he fell heavily to the 
<A NAME="267"></A>ground and his eyes were closed in darkness. Thus did these two noble comrades 
<A NAME="268"></A>of Sarpedon go down to Erebus slain by the two sons of Nestor; they were 
<A NAME="269"></A>the warrior sons of Amisodorus, who had reared the invincible Chimaera, 
<A NAME="270"></A>to the bane of many. Ajax son of Oileus sprang on Cleobulus and took him 
<A NAME="271"></A>alive as he was entangled in the crush; but he killed him then and there 
<A NAME="272"></A>by a sword-blow on the neck. The sword reeked with his blood, while dark 
<A NAME="273"></A>death and the strong hand of fate gripped him and closed his 
<A NAME="274"></A>eyes.
<A NAME="275"></A><BR><BR>Peneleos and Lycon now met in close fight, for they had missed 
<A NAME="276"></A>each other with their spears. They had both thrown without effect, so now 
<A NAME="277"></A>they drew their swords. Lycon struck the plumed crest of Peneleos' helmet 
<A NAME="278"></A>but his sword broke at the hilt, while Peneleos smote Lycon on the neck 
<A NAME="279"></A>under the ear. The blade sank so deep that the head was held on by nothing 
<A NAME="280"></A>but the skin, and there was no more life left in him. Meriones gave chase 
<A NAME="281"></A>to Acamas on foot and caught him up just as he was about to mount his chariot; 
<A NAME="282"></A>he drove a spear through his right shoulder so that he fell headlong from 
<A NAME="283"></A>the car, and his eyes were closed in darkness. Idomeneus speared Erymas 
<A NAME="284"></A>in the mouth; the bronze point of the spear went clean through it beneath 
<A NAME="285"></A>the brain, crashing in among the white bones and smashing them up. His 
<A NAME="286"></A>teeth were all of them knocked out and the blood came gushing in a stream 
<A NAME="287"></A>from both his eyes; it also came gurgling up from his mouth and nostrils, 
<A NAME="288"></A>and the darkness of death enfolded him round about.
<A NAME="289"></A><BR><BR>Thus did these chieftains of the Danaans each of them kill his 
<A NAME="290"></A>man. As ravening wolves seize on kids or lambs, fastening on them when 
<A NAME="291"></A>they are alone on the hillsides and have strayed from the main flock through 
<A NAME="292"></A>the carelessness of the shepherd- and when the wolves see this they pounce 
<A NAME="293"></A>upon them at once because they cannot defend themselves- even so did the 
<A NAME="294"></A>Danaans now fall on the Trojans, who fled with ill-omened cries in their 
<A NAME="295"></A>panic and had no more fight left in them.
<A NAME="296"></A><BR><BR>Meanwhile great Ajax kept on trying to drive a spear into Hector, 
<A NAME="297"></A>but Hector was so skilful that he held his broad shoulders well under cover 
<A NAME="298"></A>of his ox-hide shield, ever on the look-out for the whizzing of the arrows 
<A NAME="299"></A>and the heavy thud of the spears. He well knew that the fortunes of the 
<A NAME="300"></A>day had changed, but still stood his ground and tried to protect his 
<A NAME="301"></A>comrades.
<A NAME="302"></A><BR><BR>As when a cloud goes up into heaven from Olympus, rising out of 
<A NAME="303"></A>a clear sky when Jove is brewing a gale- even with such panic stricken 
<A NAME="304"></A>rout did the Trojans now fly, and there was no order in their going. Hector's 
<A NAME="305"></A>fleet horses bore him and his armour out of the fight, and he left the 
<A NAME="306"></A>Trojan host penned in by the deep trench against their will. Many a yoke 
<A NAME="307"></A>of horses snapped the pole of their chariots in the trench and left their 
<A NAME="308"></A>master's car behind them. Patroclus gave chase, calling impetuously on 
<A NAME="309"></A>the Danaans and full of fury against the Trojans, who, being now no longer 
<A NAME="310"></A>in a body, filled all the ways with their cries of panic and rout; the 
<A NAME="311"></A>air was darkened with the clouds of dust they raised, and the horses strained 
<A NAME="312"></A>every nerve in their flight from the tents and ships towards the 
<A NAME="313"></A>city.
<A NAME="314"></A><BR><BR>Patroclus kept on heading his horses wherever he saw most men flying 
<A NAME="315"></A>in confusion, cheering on his men the while. Chariots were being smashed 
<A NAME="316"></A>in all directions, and many a man came tumbling down from his own car to 
<A NAME="317"></A>fall beneath the wheels of that of Patroclus, whose immortal steeds, given 
<A NAME="318"></A>by the gods to Peleus, sprang over the trench at a bound as they sped onward. 
<A NAME="319"></A>He was intent on trying to get near Hector, for he had set his heart on 
<A NAME="320"></A>spearing him, but Hector's horses were now hurrying him away. As the whole 
<A NAME="321"></A>dark earth bows before some tempest on an autumn day when Jove rains his 
<A NAME="322"></A>hardest to punish men for giving crooked judgement in their courts, and 
<A NAME="323"></A>arriving justice therefrom without heed to the decrees of heaven- all the 
<A NAME="324"></A>rivers run full and the torrents tear many a new channel as they roar headlong 
<A NAME="325"></A>from the mountains to the dark sea, and it fares ill with the works of 
<A NAME="326"></A>men- even such was the stress and strain of the Trojan horses in their 
<A NAME="327"></A>flight.
<A NAME="328"></A><BR><BR>Patroclus now cut off the battalions that were nearest to him and 
<A NAME="329"></A>drove them back to the ships. They were doing their best to reach the city, 
<A NAME="330"></A>but he would not Yet them, and bore down on them between the river and 
<A NAME="331"></A>the ships and wall. Many a fallen comrade did he then avenge. First he 
<A NAME="332"></A>hit Pronous with a spear on the chest where it was exposed near the rim 
<A NAME="333"></A>of his shield, and he fell heavily to the ground. Next he sprang on Thestor 
<A NAME="334"></A>son of Enops, who was sitting all huddled up in his chariot, for he had 
<A NAME="335"></A>lost his head and the reins had been torn out of his hands. Patroclus went 
<A NAME="336"></A>up to him and drove a spear into his right jaw; he thus hooked him by the 
<A NAME="337"></A>teeth and the spear pulled him over the rim of his car, as one who sits 
<A NAME="338"></A>at the end of some jutting rock and draws a strong fish out of the sea 
<A NAME="339"></A>with a hook and a line- even so with his spear did he pull Thestor all 
<A NAME="340"></A>gaping from his chariot; he then threw him down on his face and he died 
<A NAME="341"></A>while falling. On this, as Erylaus was on to attack him, he struck him 
<A NAME="342"></A>full on the head with a stone, and his brains were all battered inside 
<A NAME="343"></A>his helmet, whereon he fell headlong to the ground and the pangs of death 
<A NAME="344"></A>took hold upon him. Then he laid low, one after the other, Erymas, Amphoterus, 
<A NAME="345"></A>Epaltes, Tlepolemus, Echius son of Damastor, Pyris, lpheus, Euippus and 
<A NAME="346"></A>Polymelus son of Argeas.
<A NAME="347"></A><BR><BR>Now when Sarpedon saw his comrades, men who wore ungirdled tunics, 
<A NAME="348"></A>being overcome by Patroclus son of Menoetius, he rebuked the Lycians saying. 
<A NAME="349"></A>"Shame on you, where are you flying to? Show your mettle; I will myself 
<A NAME="350"></A>meet this man in fight and learn who it is that is so masterful; he has 
<A NAME="351"></A>done us much hurt, and has stretched many a brave man upon the 
<A NAME="352"></A>ground."
<A NAME="353"></A><BR><BR>He sprang from his chariot as he spoke, and Patroclus, when he 
<A NAME="354"></A>saw this, leaped on to the ground also. The two then rushed at one another 
<A NAME="355"></A>with loud cries like eagle-beaked crook-taloned vultures that scream and 
<A NAME="356"></A>tear at one another in some high mountain fastness.
<A NAME="357"></A><BR><BR>The son of scheming Saturn looked down upon them in pity and said 
<A NAME="358"></A>to Juno who was his wife and sister, "Alas, that it should be the lot of 
<A NAME="359"></A>Sarpedon whom I love so dearly to perish by the hand of Patroclus. I am 
<A NAME="360"></A>in two minds whether to catch him up out of the fight and set him down 
<A NAME="361"></A>safe and sound in the fertile land of Lycia, or to let him now fall by 
<A NAME="362"></A>the hand of the son of Menoetius."
<A NAME="363"></A><BR><BR>And Juno answered, "Most dread son of Saturn, what is this that 
<A NAME="364"></A>you are saying? Would you snatch a mortal man, whose doom has long been 
<A NAME="365"></A>fated, out of the jaws of death? Do as you will, but we shall not all of 
<A NAME="366"></A>us be of your mind. I say further, and lay my saying to your heart, that 
<A NAME="367"></A>if you send Sarpedon safely to his own home, some other of the gods will 
<A NAME="368"></A>be also wanting to escort his son out of battle, for there are many sons 
<A NAME="369"></A>of gods fighting round the city of Troy, and you will make every one jealous. 
<A NAME="370"></A>If, however, you are fond of him and pity him, let him indeed fall by the 
<A NAME="371"></A>hand of Patroclus, but as soon as the life is gone out of him, send Death 
<A NAME="372"></A>and sweet Sleep to bear him off the field and take him to the broad lands 
<A NAME="373"></A>of Lycia, where his brothers and his kinsmen will bury him with mound and 
<A NAME="374"></A>pillar, in due honour to the dead."
<A NAME="375"></A><BR><BR>The sire of gods and men assented, but he shed a rain of blood 
<A NAME="376"></A>upon the earth in honour of his son whom Patroclus was about to kill on 
<A NAME="377"></A>the rich plain of Troy far from his home.
<A NAME="378"></A><BR><BR>When they were now come close to one another Patroclus struck Thrasydemus, 
<A NAME="379"></A>the brave squire of Sarpedon, in the lower part of the belly, and killed 
<A NAME="380"></A>him. Sarpedon then aimed a spear at Patroclus and missed him, but he struck 
<A NAME="381"></A>the horse Pedasus in the right shoulder, and it screamed aloud as it lay, 
<A NAME="382"></A>groaning in the dust until the life went out of it. The other two horses 
<A NAME="383"></A>began to plunge; the pole of the chariot cracked and they got entangled 
<A NAME="384"></A>in the reins through the fall of the horse that was yoked along with them; 
<A NAME="385"></A>but Automedon knew what to do; without the loss of a moment he drew the 
<A NAME="386"></A>keen blade that hung by his sturdy thigh and cut the third horse adrift; 
<A NAME="387"></A>whereon the other two righted themselves, and pulling hard at the reins 
<A NAME="388"></A>again went together into battle.
<A NAME="389"></A><BR><BR>Sarpedon now took a second aim at Patroclus, and again missed him, 
<A NAME="390"></A>the point of the spear passed over his left shoulder without hitting him. 
<A NAME="391"></A>Patroclus then aimed in his turn, and the spear sped not from his hand 
<A NAME="392"></A>in vain, for he hit Sarpedon just where the midriff surrounds the ever-beating 
<A NAME="393"></A>heart. He fell like some oak or silver poplar or tall pine to which woodmen 
<A NAME="394"></A>have laid their axes upon the mountains to make timber for ship-building- 
<A NAME="395"></A>even so did he lie stretched at full length in front of his chariot and 
<A NAME="396"></A>horses, moaning and clutching at the blood-stained dust. As when a lion 
<A NAME="397"></A>springs with a bound upon a herd of cattle and fastens on a great black 
<A NAME="398"></A>bull which dies bellowing in its clutches- even so did the leader of the 
<A NAME="399"></A>Lycian warriors struggle in death as he fell by the hand of Patroclus. 
<A NAME="400"></A>He called on his trusty comrade and said, "Glaucus, my brother, hero among 
<A NAME="401"></A>heroes, put forth all your strength, fight with might and main, now if 
<A NAME="402"></A>ever quit yourself like a valiant soldier. First go about among the Lycian 
<A NAME="403"></A>captains and bid them fight for Sarpedon; then yourself also do battle 
<A NAME="404"></A>to save my armour from being taken. My name will haunt you henceforth and 
<A NAME="405"></A>for ever if the Achaeans rob me of my armour now that I have fallen at 
<A NAME="406"></A>their ships. Do your very utmost and call all my people 
<A NAME="407"></A>together."
<A NAME="408"></A><BR><BR>Death closed his eyes as he spoke. Patroclus planted his heel on 
<A NAME="409"></A>his breast and drew the spear from his body, whereon his senses came out 
<A NAME="410"></A>along with it, and he drew out both spear-point and Sarpedon's soul at 
<A NAME="411"></A>the same time. Hard by the Myrmidons held his snorting steeds, who were 
<A NAME="412"></A>wild with panic at finding themselves deserted by their 
<A NAME="413"></A>lords.
<A NAME="414"></A><BR><BR>Glaucus was overcome with grief when he heard what Sarpedon said, 
<A NAME="415"></A>for he could not help him. He had to support his arm with his other hand, 
<A NAME="416"></A>being in great pain through the wound which Teucer's arrow had given him 
<A NAME="417"></A>when Teucer was defending the wall as he, Glaucus, was assailing it. Therefore 
<A NAME="418"></A>he prayed to far-darting Apollo saying, "Hear me O king from your seat, 
<A NAME="419"></A>may be in the rich land of Lycia, or may be in Troy, for in all places 
<A NAME="420"></A>you can hear the prayer of one who is in distress, as I now am. I have 
<A NAME="421"></A>a grievous wound; my hand is aching with pain, there is no staunching the 
<A NAME="422"></A>blood, and my whole arm drags by reason of my hurt, so that I cannot grasp 
<A NAME="423"></A>my sword nor go among my foes and fight them, thou our prince, Jove's son 
<A NAME="424"></A>Sarpedon, is slain. Jove defended not his son, do you, therefore, O king, 
<A NAME="425"></A>heal me of my wound, ease my pain and grant me strength both to cheer on 
<A NAME="426"></A>the Lycians and to fight along with them round the body of him who has 
<A NAME="427"></A>fallen."
<A NAME="428"></A><BR><BR>Thus did he pray, and Apollo heard his prayer. He eased his pain, 
<A NAME="429"></A>staunched the black blood from the wound, and gave him new strength. Glaucus 
<A NAME="430"></A>perceived this, and was thankful that the mighty god had answered his prayer; 
<A NAME="431"></A>forthwith, therefore, he went among the Lycian captains, and bade them 
<A NAME="432"></A>come to fight about the body of Sarpedon. From these he strode on among 
<A NAME="433"></A>the Trojans to Polydamas son of Panthous and Agenor; he then went in search 
<A NAME="434"></A>of Aeneas and Hector, and when he had found them he said, "Hector, you 
<A NAME="435"></A>have utterly forgotten your allies, who languish here for your sake far 
<A NAME="436"></A>from friends and home while you do nothing to support them. Sarpedon leader 
<A NAME="437"></A>of the Lycian warriors has fallen- he who was at once the right and might 
<A NAME="438"></A>of Lycia; Mars has laid him low by the spear of Patroclus. Stand by him, 
<A NAME="439"></A>my friends, and suffer not the Myrmidons to strip him of his armour, nor 
<A NAME="440"></A>to treat his body with contumely in revenge for all the Danaans whom we 
<A NAME="441"></A>have speared at the ships."
<A NAME="442"></A><BR><BR>As he spoke the Trojans were plunged in extreme and ungovernable 
<A NAME="443"></A>grief; for Sarpedon, alien though he was, had been one of the main stays 
<A NAME="444"></A>of their city, both as having much people with him, and himself the foremost 
<A NAME="445"></A>among them all. Led by Hector, who was infuriated by the fall of Sarpedon, 
<A NAME="446"></A>they made instantly for the Danaans with all their might, while the undaunted 
<A NAME="447"></A>spirit of Patroclus son of Menoetius cheered on the Achaeans. First he 
<A NAME="448"></A>spoke to the two Ajaxes, men who needed no bidding. "Ajaxes," said he, 
<A NAME="449"></A>"may it now please you to show youselves the men you have always been, 
<A NAME="450"></A>or even better- Sarpedon is fallen- he who was first to overleap the wall 
<A NAME="451"></A>of the Achaeans; let us take the body and outrage it; let us strip the 
<A NAME="452"></A>armour from his shoulders, and kill his comrades if they try to rescue 
<A NAME="453"></A>his body."
<A NAME="454"></A><BR><BR>He spoke to men who of themselves were full eager; both sides, 
<A NAME="455"></A>therefore, the Trojans and Lycians on the one hand, and the Myrmidons and 
<A NAME="456"></A>Achaeans on the other, strengthened their battalions, and fought desperately 
<A NAME="457"></A>about the body of Sarpedon, shouting fiercely the while. Mighty was the 
<A NAME="458"></A>din of their armour as they came together, and Jove shed a thick darkness 
<A NAME="459"></A>over the fight, to increase the of the battle over the body of his 
<A NAME="460"></A>son.
<A NAME="461"></A><BR><BR>At first the Trojans made some headway against the Achaeans, for 
<A NAME="462"></A>one of the best men among the Myrmidons was killed, Epeigeus, son of noble 
<A NAME="463"></A>Agacles who had erewhile been king in the good city of Budeum; but presently, 
<A NAME="464"></A>having killed a valiant kinsman of his own, he took refuge with Peleus 
<A NAME="465"></A>and Thetis, who sent him to Ilius the land of noble steeds to fight the 
<A NAME="466"></A>Trojans under Achilles. Hector now struck him on the head with a stone 
<A NAME="467"></A>just as he had caught hold of the body, and his brains inside his helmet 
<A NAME="468"></A>were all battered in, so that he fell face foremost upon the body of Sarpedon, 
<A NAME="469"></A>and there died. Patroclus was enraged by the death of his comrade, and 
<A NAME="470"></A>sped through the front ranks as swiftly as a hawk that swoops down on a 
<A NAME="471"></A>flock of daws or starlings. Even so swiftly, O noble knight Patroclus, 
<A NAME="472"></A>did you make straight for the Lycians and Trojans to avenge your comrade. 
<A NAME="473"></A>Forthwith he struck Sthenelaus the son of Ithaemenes on the neck with a 
<A NAME="474"></A>stone, and broke the tendons that join it to the head and spine. On this 
<A NAME="475"></A>Hector and the front rank of his men gave ground. As far as a man can throw 
<A NAME="476"></A>a javelin when competing for some prize, or even in battle- so far did 
<A NAME="477"></A>the Trojans now retreat before the Achaeans. Glaucus, captain of the Lycians, 
<A NAME="478"></A>was the first to rally them, by killing Bathycles son of Chalcon who lived 
<A NAME="479"></A>in Hellas and was the richest man among the Myrmidons. Glaucus turned round 
<A NAME="480"></A>suddenly, just as Bathycles who was pursuing him was about to lay hold 
<A NAME="481"></A>of him, and drove his spear right into the middle of his chest, whereon 
<A NAME="482"></A>he fell heavily to the ground, and the fall of so good a man filled the 
<A NAME="483"></A>Achaeans with dismay, while the Trojans were exultant, and came up in a 
<A NAME="484"></A>body round the corpse. Nevertheless the Achaeans, mindful of their prowess, 
<A NAME="485"></A>bore straight down upon them.
<A NAME="486"></A><BR><BR>Meriones then killed a helmed warrior of the Trojans, Laogonus 
<A NAME="487"></A>son of Onetor, who was priest of Jove of Mt. Ida, and was honoured by the 
<A NAME="488"></A>people as though he were a god. Meriones struck him under the jaw and ear, 
<A NAME="489"></A>so that life went out of him and the darkness of death laid hold upon him. 
<A NAME="490"></A>Aeneas then aimed a spear at Meriones, hoping to hit him under the shield 
<A NAME="491"></A>as he was advancing, but Meriones saw it coming and stooped forward to 
<A NAME="492"></A>avoid it, whereon the spear flew past him and the point stuck in the ground, 
<A NAME="493"></A>while the butt-end went on quivering till Mars robbed it of its force. 
<A NAME="494"></A>The spear, therefore, sped from Aeneas's hand in vain and fell quivering 
<A NAME="495"></A>to the ground. Aeneas was angry and said, "Meriones, you are a good dancer, 
<A NAME="496"></A>but if I had hit you my spear would soon have made an end of 
<A NAME="497"></A>you."
<A NAME="498"></A><BR><BR>And Meriones answered, "Aeneas, for all your bravery, you will 
<A NAME="499"></A>not be able to make an end of every one who comes against you. You are 
<A NAME="500"></A>only a mortal like myself, and if I were to hit you in the middle of your 
<A NAME="501"></A>shield with my spear, however strong and self-confident you may be, I should 
<A NAME="502"></A>soon vanquish you, and you would yield your life to Hades of the noble 
<A NAME="503"></A>steeds."
<A NAME="504"></A><BR><BR>On this the son of Menoetius rebuked him and said, "Meriones, hero 
<A NAME="505"></A>though you be, you should not speak thus; taunting speeches, my good friend, 
<A NAME="506"></A>will not make the Trojans draw away from the dead body; some of them must 
<A NAME="507"></A>go under ground first; blows for battle, and words for council; fight, 
<A NAME="508"></A>therefore, and say nothing."
<A NAME="509"></A><BR><BR>He led the way as he spoke and the hero went forward with him. 
<A NAME="510"></A>As the sound of woodcutters in some forest glade upon the mountains- and 
<A NAME="511"></A>the thud of their axes is heard afar- even such a din now rose from earth-clash 
<A NAME="512"></A>of bronze armour and of good ox-hide shields, as men smote each other with 
<A NAME="513"></A>their swords and spears pointed at both ends. A man had need of good eyesight 
<A NAME="514"></A>now to know Sarpedon, so covered was he from head to foot with spears and 
<A NAME="515"></A>blood and dust. Men swarmed about the body, as flies that buzz round the 
<A NAME="516"></A>full milk-pails in spring when they are brimming with milk- even so did 
<A NAME="517"></A>they gather round Sarpedon; nor did Jove turn his keen eyes away for one 
<A NAME="518"></A>moment from the fight, but kept looking at it all the time, for he was 
<A NAME="519"></A>settling how best to kill Patroclus, and considering whether Hector should 
<A NAME="520"></A>be allowed to end him now in the fight round the body of Sarpedon, and 
<A NAME="521"></A>strip him of his armour, or whether he should let him give yet further 
<A NAME="522"></A>trouble to the Trojans. In the end, he deemed it best that the brave squire 
<A NAME="523"></A>of Achilles son of Peleus should drive Hector and the Trojans back towards 
<A NAME="524"></A>the city and take the lives of many. First, therefore, he made Hector turn 
<A NAME="525"></A>fainthearted, whereon he mounted his chariot and fled, bidding the other 
<A NAME="526"></A>Trojans fly also, for he saw that the scales of Jove had turned against 
<A NAME="527"></A>him. Neither would the brave Lycians stand firm; they were dismayed when 
<A NAME="528"></A>they saw their king lying struck to the heart amid a heap of corpses- for 
<A NAME="529"></A>when the son of Saturn made the fight wax hot many had fallen above him. 
<A NAME="530"></A>The Achaeans, therefore stripped the gleaming armour from his shoulders 
<A NAME="531"></A>and the brave son of Menoetius gave it to his men to take to the ships. 
<A NAME="532"></A>Then Jove lord of the storm-cloud said to Apollo, "Dear Phoebus, go, I 
<A NAME="533"></A>pray you, and take Sarpedon out of range of the weapons; cleanse the black 
<A NAME="534"></A>blood from off him, and then bear him a long way off where you may wash 
<A NAME="535"></A>him in the river, anoint him with ambrosia, and clothe him in immortal 
<A NAME="536"></A>raiment; this done, commit him to the arms of the two fleet messengers, 
<A NAME="537"></A>Death, and Sleep, who will carry him straightway to the rich land of Lycia, 
<A NAME="538"></A>where his brothers and kinsmen will inter him, and will raise both mound 
<A NAME="539"></A>and pillar to his memory, in due honour to the dead."
<A NAME="540"></A><BR><BR>Thus he spoke. Apollo obeyed his father's saying, and came down 
<A NAME="541"></A>from the heights of Ida into the thick of the fight; forthwith he took 
<A NAME="542"></A>Sarpedon out of range of the weapons, and then bore him a long way off, 
<A NAME="543"></A>where he washed him in the river, anointed him with ambrosia and clothed 
<A NAME="544"></A>him in immortal raiment; this done, he committed him to the arms of the 
<A NAME="545"></A>two fleet messengers, Death, and Sleep, who presently set him down in the 
<A NAME="546"></A>rich land of Lycia.
<A NAME="547"></A><BR><BR>Meanwhile Patroclus, with many a shout to his horses and to Automedon, 
<A NAME="548"></A>pursued the Trojans and Lycians in the pride and foolishness of his heart. 
<A NAME="549"></A>Had he but obeyed the bidding of the son of Peleus, he would have, escaped 
<A NAME="550"></A>death and have been scatheless; but the counsels of Jove pass man's understanding; 
<A NAME="551"></A>he will put even a brave man to flight and snatch victory from his grasp, 
<A NAME="552"></A>or again he will set him on to fight, as he now did when he put a high 
<A NAME="553"></A>spirit into the heart of Patroclus.
<A NAME="554"></A><BR><BR>Who then first, and who last, was slain by you, O Patroclus, when 
<A NAME="555"></A>the gods had now called you to meet your doom? First Adrestus, Autonous, 
<A NAME="556"></A>Echeclus, Perimus the son of Megas, Epistor and Melanippus; after these 
<A NAME="557"></A>he killed Elasus, Mulius, and Pylartes. These he slew, but the rest saved 
<A NAME="558"></A>themselves by flight.
<A NAME="559"></A><BR><BR>The sons of the Achaeans would now have taken Troy by the hands 
<A NAME="560"></A>of Patroclus, for his spear flew in all directions, had not Phoebus Apollo 
<A NAME="561"></A>taken his stand upon the wall to defeat his purpose and to aid the Trojans. 
<A NAME="562"></A>Thrice did Patroclus charge at an angle of the high wall, and thrice did 
<A NAME="563"></A>Apollo beat him back, striking his shield with his own immortal hands. 
<A NAME="564"></A>When Patroclus was coming on like a god for yet a fourth time, Apollo shouted 
<A NAME="565"></A>to him with an awful voice and said, "Draw back, noble Patroclus, it is 
<A NAME="566"></A>not your lot to sack the city of the Trojan chieftains, nor yet will it 
<A NAME="567"></A>be that of Achilles who is a far better man than you are." On hearing this, 
<A NAME="568"></A>Patroclus withdrew to some distance and avoided the anger of 
<A NAME="569"></A>Apollo.
<A NAME="570"></A><BR><BR>Meanwhile Hector was waiting with his horses inside the Scaean 
<A NAME="571"></A>gates, in doubt whether to drive out again and go on fighting, or to call 
<A NAME="572"></A>the army inside the gates. As he was thus doubting Phoebus Apollo drew 
<A NAME="573"></A>near him in the likeness of a young and lusty warrior Asius, who was Hector's 
<A NAME="574"></A>uncle, being own brother to Hecuba, and son of Dymas who lived in Phrygia 
<A NAME="575"></A>by the waters of the river Sangarius; in his likeness Jove's son Apollo 
<A NAME="576"></A>now spoke to Hector saying, "Hector, why have you left off fighting? It 
<A NAME="577"></A>is ill done of you. If I were as much better a man than you, as I am worse, 
<A NAME="578"></A>you should soon rue your slackness. Drive straight towards Patroclus, if 
<A NAME="579"></A>so be that Apollo may grant you a triumph over him, and you may rull 
<A NAME="580"></A>him."
<A NAME="581"></A><BR><BR>With this the god went back into the hurly-burly, and Hector bade 
<A NAME="582"></A>Cebriones drive again into the fight. Apollo passed in among them, and 
<A NAME="583"></A>struck panic into the Argives, while he gave triumph to Hector and the 
<A NAME="584"></A>Trojans. Hector let the other Danaans alone and killed no man, but drove 
<A NAME="585"></A>straight at Patroclus. Patroclus then sprang from his chariot to the ground, 
<A NAME="586"></A>with a spear in his left hand, and in his right a jagged stone as large 
<A NAME="587"></A>as his hand could hold. He stood still and threw it, nor did it go far 
<A NAME="588"></A>without hitting some one; the cast was not in vain, for the stone struck 
<A NAME="589"></A>Cebriones, Hector's charioteer, a bastard son of Priam, as he held the 
<A NAME="590"></A>reins in his hands. The stone hit him on the forehead and drove his brows 
<A NAME="591"></A>into his head for the bone was smashed, and his eyes fell to the ground 
<A NAME="592"></A>at his feet. He dropped dead from his chariot as though he were diving, 
<A NAME="593"></A>and there was no more life left in him. Over him did you then vaunt, O 
<A NAME="594"></A>knight Patroclus, saying, "Bless my heart, how active he is, and how well 
<A NAME="595"></A>he dives. If we had been at sea this fellow would have dived from the ship's 
<A NAME="596"></A>side and brought up as many oysters as the whole crew could stomach, even 
<A NAME="597"></A>in rough water, for he has dived beautifully off his chariot on to the 
<A NAME="598"></A>ground. It seems, then, that there are divers also among the 
<A NAME="599"></A>Trojans."
<A NAME="600"></A><BR><BR>As he spoke he flung himself on Cebriones with the spring, as it 
<A NAME="601"></A>were, of a lion that while attacking a stockyard is himself struck in the 
<A NAME="602"></A>chest, and his courage is his own bane- even so furiously, O Patroclus, 
<A NAME="603"></A>did you then spring upon Cebriones. Hector sprang also from his chariot 
<A NAME="604"></A>to the ground. The pair then fought over the body of Cebriones. As two 
<A NAME="605"></A>lions fight fiercely on some high mountain over the body of a stag that 
<A NAME="606"></A>they have killed, even so did these two mighty warriors, Patroclus son 
<A NAME="607"></A>of Menoetius and brave Hector, hack and hew at one another over the corpse 
<A NAME="608"></A>of Cebriones. Hector would not let him go when he had once got him by the 
<A NAME="609"></A>head, while Patroclus kept fast hold of his feet, and a fierce fight raged 
<A NAME="610"></A>between the other Danaans and Trojans. As the east and south wind buffet 
<A NAME="611"></A>one another when they beat upon some dense forest on the mountains- there 
<A NAME="612"></A>is beech and ash and spreading cornel; the to of the trees roar as they 
<A NAME="613"></A>beat on one another, and one can hear the boughs cracking and breaking- 
<A NAME="614"></A>even so did the Trojans and Achaeans spring upon one another and lay about 
<A NAME="615"></A>each other, and neither side would give way. Many a pointed spear fell 
<A NAME="616"></A>to ground and many a winged arrow sped from its bow-string about the body 
<A NAME="617"></A>of Cebriones; many a great stone, moreover, beat on many a shield as they 
<A NAME="618"></A>fought around his body, but there he lay in the whirling clouds of dust, 
<A NAME="619"></A>all huge and hugely, heedless of his driving now.
<A NAME="620"></A><BR><BR>So long as the sun was still high in mid-heaven the weapons of 
<A NAME="621"></A>either side were alike deadly, and the people fell; but when he went down 
<A NAME="622"></A>towards the time when men loose their oxen, the Achaeans proved to be beyond 
<A NAME="623"></A>all forecast stronger, so that they drew Cebriones out of range of the 
<A NAME="624"></A>darts and tumult of the Trojans, and stripped the armour from his shoulders. 
<A NAME="625"></A>Then Patroclus sprang like Mars with fierce intent and a terrific shout 
<A NAME="626"></A>upon the Trojans, and thrice did he kill nine men; but as he was coming 
<A NAME="627"></A>on like a god for a time, then, O Patroclus, was the hour of your end approaching, 
<A NAME="628"></A>for Phoebus fought you in fell earnest. Patroclus did not see him as he 
<A NAME="629"></A>moved about in the crush, for he was enshrouded in thick darkness, and 
<A NAME="630"></A>the god struck him from behind on his back and his broad shoulders with 
<A NAME="631"></A>the flat of his hand, so that his eyes turned dizzy. Phoebus Apollo beat 
<A NAME="632"></A>the helmet from off his head, and it rolled rattling off under the horses' 
<A NAME="633"></A>feet, where its horse-hair plumes were all begrimed with dust and blood. 
<A NAME="634"></A>Never indeed had that helmet fared so before, for it had served to protect 
<A NAME="635"></A>the head and comely forehead of the godlike hero Achilles. Now, however, 
<A NAME="636"></A>Zeus delivered it over to be worn by Hector. Nevertheless the end of Hector 
<A NAME="637"></A>also was near. The bronze-shod spear, so great and so strong, was broken 
<A NAME="638"></A>in the hand of Patroclus, while his shield that covered him from head to 
<A NAME="639"></A>foot fell to the ground as did also the band that held it, and Apollo undid 
<A NAME="640"></A>the fastenings of his corslet.
<A NAME="641"></A><BR><BR>On this his mind became clouded; his limbs failed him, and he stood 
<A NAME="642"></A>as one dazed; whereon Euphorbus son of Panthous a Dardanian, the best spearman 
<A NAME="643"></A>of his time, as also the finest horseman and fleetest runner, came behind 
<A NAME="644"></A>him and struck him in the back with a spear, midway between the shoulders. 
<A NAME="645"></A>This man as soon as ever he had come up with his chariot had dismounted 
<A NAME="646"></A>twenty men, so proficient was he in all the arts of war- he it was, O knight 
<A NAME="647"></A>Patroclus, that first drove a weapon into you, but he did not quite overpower 
<A NAME="648"></A>you. Euphorbus then ran back into the crowd, after drawing his ashen spear 
<A NAME="649"></A>out of the wound; he would not stand firm and wait for Patroclus, unarmed 
<A NAME="650"></A>though he now was, to attack him; but Patroclus unnerved, alike by the 
<A NAME="651"></A>blow the god had given him and by the spear-wound, drew back under cover 
<A NAME="652"></A>of his men in fear for his life. Hector on this, seeing him to be wounded 
<A NAME="653"></A>and giving ground, forced his way through the ranks, and when close up 
<A NAME="654"></A>with him struck him in the lower part of the belly with a spear, driving 
<A NAME="655"></A>the bronze point right through it, so that he fell heavily to the ground 
<A NAME="656"></A>to the great of the Achaeans. As when a lion has fought some fierce wild-boar 
<A NAME="657"></A>and worsted him- the two fight furiously upon the mountains over some little 
<A NAME="658"></A>fountain at which they would both drink, and the lion has beaten the boar 
<A NAME="659"></A>till he can hardly breathe- even so did Hector son of Priam take the life 
<A NAME="660"></A>of the brave son of Menoetius who had killed so many, striking him from 
<A NAME="661"></A>close at hand, and vaunting over him the while. "Patroclus," said he, "you 
<A NAME="662"></A>deemed that you should sack our city, rob our Trojan women of their freedom, 
<A NAME="663"></A>and carry them off in your ships to your own country. Fool; Hector and 
<A NAME="664"></A>his fleet horses were ever straining their utmost to defend them. I am 
<A NAME="665"></A>foremost of all the Trojan warriors to stave the day of bondage from off 
<A NAME="666"></A>them; as for you, vultures shall devour you here. Poor wretch, Achilles 
<A NAME="667"></A>with all his bravery availed you nothing; and yet I ween when you left 
<A NAME="668"></A>him he charged you straitly saying, 'Come not back to the ships, knight 
<A NAME="669"></A>Patroclus, till you have rent the bloodstained shirt of murderous Hector 
<A NAME="670"></A>about his body. Thus I ween did he charge you, and your fool's heart answered 
<A NAME="671"></A>him 'yea' within you."
<A NAME="672"></A><BR><BR>Then, as the life ebbed out of you, you answered, O knight Patroclus: 
<A NAME="673"></A>"Hector, vaunt as you will, for Jove the son of Saturn and Apollo have 
<A NAME="674"></A>vouchsafed you victory; it is they who have vanquished me so easily, and 
<A NAME="675"></A>they who have stripped the armour from my shoulders; had twenty such men 
<A NAME="676"></A>as you attacked me, all of them would have fallen before my spear. Fate 
<A NAME="677"></A>and the son of Leto have overpowered me, and among mortal men Euphorbus; 
<A NAME="678"></A>you are yourself third only in the killing of me. I say further, and lay 
<A NAME="679"></A>my saying to your heart, you too shall live but for a little season; death 
<A NAME="680"></A>and the day of your doom are close upon you, and they will lay you low 
<A NAME="681"></A>by the hand of Achilles son of Aeacus."
<A NAME="682"></A><BR><BR>When he had thus spoken his eyes were closed in death, his soul 
<A NAME="683"></A>left his body and flitted down to the house of Hades, mourning its sad 
<A NAME="684"></A>fate and bidding farewell to the youth and vigor of its manhood. Dead though 
<A NAME="685"></A>he was, Hector still spoke to him saying, "Patroclus, why should you thus 
<A NAME="686"></A>foretell my doom? Who knows but Achilles, son of lovely Thetis, may be 
<A NAME="687"></A>smitten by my spear and die before me?"
<A NAME="688"></A><BR><BR>As he spoke he drew the bronze spear from the wound, planting his 
<A NAME="689"></A>foot upon the body, which he thrust off and let lie on its back. He then 
<A NAME="690"></A>went spear in hand after Automedon, squire of the fleet descendant of Aeacus, 
<A NAME="691"></A>for he longed to lay him low, but the immortal steeds which the gods had 
<A NAME="692"></A>given as a rich gift to Peleus bore him swiftly from the 
<A NAME="693"></A>field.
