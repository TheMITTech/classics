<A NAME="10"></A><B>Part 51</B>
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="11"></A>You recognize, Maximus, the theory of Plato, as far as I have been able 
<A NAME="12"></A>to give it a lucid explanation in the time at my disposal. I put my trust 
<A NAME="13"></A>in him when he says that the cause of epilepsy is the overflowing of this 
<A NAME="14"></A>pestilential humour into the head. My inquiry therefore was, I think, reasonable 
<A NAME="15"></A>when I asked the woman whether her head felt heavy, her neck numb, her 
<A NAME="16"></A>temples throbbing, her ears full of noises. The fact that she acknowledged 
<A NAME="17"></A>these noises to be more frequent in her right ear was proof that the disease 
<A NAME="18"></A>had gone home. For the right-hand organs of the body are the strongest, 
<A NAME="19"></A>and therefore their infection with the disease leaves small hope of recovery. 
<A NAME="20"></A>Indeed Aristotle has left it on record in his Problems that whenever in 
<A NAME="21"></A>the case of epileptics the disease begins on the right side, their cure 
<A NAME="22"></A>is very difficult. It would be tedious were I to repeat the opinion of 
<A NAME="23"></A>Theophrastus also on the subject of epilepsy. For he has left a most excellent 
<A NAME="24"></A>treatise on convulsions. He asserts, however, in another book on the subject 
<A NAME="25"></A>of animals ill-disposed towards mankind, that the skins of newts -- which 
<A NAME="26"></A>like other reptiles they shed at fixed intervals for the renewal of their 
<A NAME="27"></A>youth -- form a remedy for fits. But unless you snatch up the skin as soon 
<A NAME="28"></A>as it be shed, they straightway turn upon it and devour it, whether from 
<A NAME="29"></A>a malign foreknowledge of its value to men or from a natural taste for 
<A NAME="30"></A>it.
<A NAME="31"></A><BR><BR>I have mentioned these things, I have been careful to quote the 
<A NAME="32"></A>arguments of renowned philosophers, and to mention the books where they 
<A NAME="33"></A>are to be found, and have avoided any reference to the works of physicians 
<A NAME="34"></A>or poets, that my adversaries may cease to wonder that philosophers have 
<A NAME="35"></A>learnt the causes of remedies and diseases in the natural course of their 
<A NAME="36"></A>researches.
<A NAME="37"></A><BR><BR>Well then, since this woman was brought to be examined by me in 
<A NAME="38"></A>the hope that she might be cured, and since it is clear both from the evidence 
<A NAME="39"></A>of the physician who brought her and from the arguments I have just set 
<A NAME="40"></A>forth that such a course was perfectly right, my opponents must needs assert 
<A NAME="41"></A>that it is the part of a magician and evildoer to heal disease, or, if 
<A NAME="42"></A>they do not dare to say that, must confess that their accusations in regard 
<A NAME="43"></A>to this epileptic boy and woman are false, absurd, and indeed 
<A NAME="44"></A>epileptic.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="45"></A><B>Part 52</B>

<A NAME="46"></A><BR><BR>Yes, Aemilianus, if you would hear the truth, you are the real 
<A NAME="47"></A>sufferer from the falling sickness, so often have your false accusations 
<A NAME="48"></A>failed and cast you helpless to the ground. Bodily collapse is no worse 
<A NAME="49"></A>than intellectual, and it is as important to keep one's head as to keep 
<A NAME="50"></A>one's feet, while it is as unpleasant to be loathed by this distinguished 
<A NAME="51"></A>gathering as to be spat upon in one's own chamber. But you perhaps think 
<A NAME="52"></A>yourself sane because you are not confined within doors, but follow the 
<A NAME="53"></A>promptings of your madness whithersoever it lead you: and yet compare your 
<A NAME="54"></A>frenzy with that of Thallus; you will find that there is but little to 
<A NAME="55"></A>choose between you, save that Thallus confines his frenzy to himself, while 
<A NAME="56"></A>you direct yours against others; Thallus distorts his eyes, you distort 
<A NAME="57"></A>the truth; Thallus contracts his hands convulsively, you not less convulsively 
<A NAME="58"></A>contract with your advocates; Thallus dashes himself against the pavement, 
<A NAME="59"></A>you dash yourself against the judgement-seat. In a word, whatever he does, 
<A NAME="60"></A>he does in his sickness erring unconsciously; but you, wretch, commit your 
<A NAME="61"></A>crimes with full knowledge and with your eyes open, such is the vehemence 
<A NAME="62"></A>of the disease that inspires your actions. You bring false accusations 
<A NAME="63"></A>as though they were true; you charge men with doing what has never been 
<A NAME="64"></A>done; though a man's innocence be clear to you as daylight, you denounce 
<A NAME="65"></A>him as though he were guilty.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="66"></A><B>Part 53</B>

<A NAME="67"></A><BR><BR>Nay, further, though I had almost forgotten to mention it, there 
<A NAME="68"></A>are certain things of which you confess your ignorance, and which nevertheless 
<A NAME="69"></A>you make material for accusation as though you knew all about them. You 
<A NAME="70"></A>assert that I kept something mysterious wrapped up in a handkerchief among 
<A NAME="71"></A>the household gods in the house of Pontianus. You confess your ignorance 
<A NAME="72"></A>as to what may have been the nature or appearance of this object; you further 
<A NAME="73"></A>admit that no one ever saw it, and yet you assert that it was some instrument 
<A NAME="74"></A>of magic. You are not to be congratulated on this method of procedure. 
<A NAME="75"></A>Your accusation reveals no shrewdness, and has not even the merit of impudence. 
<A NAME="76"></A>Do not think so for a moment. No! It shows naught save the ill-starred 
<A NAME="77"></A>madness of an embittered spirit and the pitiable fury of cantankerous old 
<A NAME="78"></A>age.
<A NAME="79"></A><BR><BR>The words you used in the presence of so grave and perspicacious 
<A NAME="80"></A>a judge amounted to something very like this. `Apuleius kept certain things 
<A NAME="81"></A>wrapped in a cloth among the household gods in the house of Pontianus. 
<A NAME="82"></A>Since I do not know what they were, I therefore argue that they were magical. 
<A NAME="83"></A>I beg you to believe what I say, because I am talking of that of which 
<A NAME="84"></A>I know nothing.' What a wonderful argument, in itself an obvious refutation 
<A NAME="85"></A>of the charge. `It must have been this, because I do not know what it was.' 
<A NAME="86"></A>You are the only person hitherto discovered who knows that which he does 
<A NAME="87"></A>not know. You so far surpass all others in folly, that whereas philosophers 
<A NAME="88"></A>of the most keen and penetrating intellect assert that we should not trust 
<A NAME="89"></A>even the objects that we see, you make statements about things which you 
<A NAME="90"></A>have never seen or heard.
<A NAME="91"></A><BR><BR>If Pontianus still lived and you were to ask him what the cloth 
<A NAME="92"></A>contained, he would reply that he did not know. There is the freedman who 
<A NAME="93"></A>still has charge of the keys of the place; he is one of your witnesses, 
<A NAME="94"></A>but he says that he has never examined these objects, although, as the 
<A NAME="95"></A>servant responsible for the books kept there, he opened and shut the doors 
<A NAME="96"></A>almost daily, continually entered the room, not seldom in my company but 
<A NAME="97"></A>more often alone, and saw the cloth lying on the table unprotected by seal 
<A NAME="98"></A>or cord. Quite natural, was it not? Magical objects were concealed in the 
<A NAME="99"></A>cloth, and for that reason I took little care for its safe custody, but 
<A NAME="100"></A>left it about anyhow for any one to examine and inspect, if he liked, or 
<A NAME="101"></A>even to carry it away! I entrusted it to the custody of others, I left 
<A NAME="102"></A>it to others to dispose of at their pleasure!
<A NAME="103"></A><BR><BR>What credence do you expect us to give you after this? Are we to 
<A NAME="104"></A>believe that you, on whom I have never set eyes save in this court, know 
<A NAME="105"></A>that of which Pontianus, who actually lived under the same roof, was ignorant? 
<A NAME="106"></A>Or shall we believe that you, who have never so much as approached the 
<A NAME="107"></A>room where they were placed, have seen what the freedman never saw, although 
<A NAME="108"></A>he had every opportunity to inspect them during the sedulous performance 
<A NAME="109"></A>of his duties?
<A NAME="110"></A><BR><BR>Suppose that what you never saw was such as you say. Yet, you fool, 
<A NAME="111"></A>if this very day you had succeeded in getting that handkerchief into your 
<A NAME="112"></A>hands, I should deny the magical nature of whatever you might produce from 
<A NAME="113"></A>it.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="114"></A><B>Part 54</B>

<A NAME="115"></A><BR><BR>I give you full leave; invent what you like, rack your memory and 
<A NAME="116"></A>your imagination to discover something that might conceivably seem to be 
<A NAME="117"></A>of a magical nature. Even then, should you succeed in so doing, I should 
<A NAME="118"></A>argue the point with you. I should say that the object in question had 
<A NAME="119"></A>been substituted by you for the original, or that it had been given as 
<A NAME="120"></A>a remedy, or that it was a sacred emblem that had been placed in my keeping, 
<A NAME="121"></A>or that a vision had bidden me to carry it thus. There are a thousand other 
<A NAME="122"></A>ways in which I might refute you with perfect truth and without giving 
<A NAME="123"></A>any explanation which is abnormal or lies outside the limits of common 
<A NAME="124"></A>observation. You are now demanding that a circumstance, which, even if 
<A NAME="125"></A>it were proved up to the hilt, would not prejudice me in the eyes of a 
<A NAME="126"></A>good judge, should be fatal to me when, as it is, it rests on vague suspicion, 
<A NAME="127"></A>uncertainty, and ignorance.
<A NAME="128"></A><BR><BR>You will perhaps, as is your wont, say, `What, then, was it that 
<A NAME="129"></A>you wrapped in a linen cloth and were so careful to deposit with the household 
<A NAME="130"></A>gods?' Really, Aemilianus! Is this the way you accuse your victims? You 
<A NAME="131"></A>produce no definite evidence yourself, but ask the accused for explanations 
<A NAME="132"></A>of everything.' `Why do you search for fish?' `Why did you examine a sick 
<A NAME="133"></A>woman?' `What had you hidden in your handkerchief?' Did you come here to 
<A NAME="134"></A>accuse me or to ask me questions? If to accuse me, prove your charges yourself; 
<A NAME="135"></A>if to ask questions, do not anticipate the truth by expressing opinions 
<A NAME="136"></A>on that concerning which your ignorance compels you to 
<A NAME="137"></A>inquire.
<A NAME="138"></A><BR><BR>If this precedent is followed, if there is no necessity for the 
<A NAME="139"></A>accuser to prove anything, but on the contrary he is given every facility 
<A NAME="140"></A>for asking questions of the accused, there is not a man in all the world 
<A NAME="141"></A>but will be indicted on some charge or other. In fact, everything that 
<A NAME="142"></A>he has ever done will be used as a handle against any man who is charged 
<A NAME="143"></A>with sorcery. Have you written a petition on the thigh of some statue? 
<A NAME="144"></A>You are a sorcerer! Else why did you write it? Have you breathed silent 
<A NAME="145"></A>prayers to heaven in some temple? You are a sorcerer! Else tell us what 
<A NAME="146"></A>you asked for? Or take the contrary line. You uttered no prayer in some 
<A NAME="147"></A>temple! You are a sorcerer! Else why did you not ask the gods for something? 
<A NAME="148"></A>The same argument will be used if you have made some votive dedication, 
<A NAME="149"></A>or offered sacrifice, or carried sprigs of some sacred plant. The day will 
<A NAME="150"></A>fail me if I attempt to go through all the different circumstances of which, 
<A NAME="151"></A>on these lines, the false accuser will demand an explanation. Above all, 
<A NAME="152"></A>whatever object he has kept concealed or stored under lock and key at home 
<A NAME="153"></A>will be asserted by the same argument to be of a magical nature, or will 
<A NAME="154"></A>be dragged from its cupboard into the light of the law-court before the 
<A NAME="155"></A>seat of judgement.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="156"></A><B>Part 55</B>

<A NAME="157"></A><BR><BR>I might discourse at greater length on the nature and importance 
<A NAME="158"></A>of such accusations, on the wide range for slander that this path opens 
<A NAME="159"></A>for Aemilianus, on the floods of perspiration that this one poor handkerchief 
<A NAME="160"></A>will cause his innocent victims. But I will follow the course I have already 
<A NAME="161"></A>pursued. I will acknowledge what there is no necessity for me to acknowledge, 
<A NAME="162"></A>and will answer Aemilianus' questions. You ask, Aemilianus, what I had 
<A NAME="163"></A>in that handkerchief.
<A NAME="164"></A><BR><BR>Although I might deny that I had deposited any handkerchief of 
<A NAME="165"></A>mine in Pontianus' library, or even admitting that it was true enough that 
<A NAME="166"></A>I did so deposit it, I might still deny that there was anything wrapped 
<A NAME="167"></A>up in it. If I should take this line, you have no evidence or argument 
<A NAME="168"></A>whereby to refute me, for there is no one who has ever handled it, and 
<A NAME="169"></A>only one freedman, according to your own assertion, who has ever seen it. 
<A NAME="170"></A>Still, as far as I am concerned I will admit the cloth to have been full 
<A NAME="171"></A>to bursting. Imagine yourself, please, to be on the brink of a great discovery, 
<A NAME="172"></A>like the comrades of Ulysses who thought they had found a treasure when 
<A NAME="173"></A>they stole the bag that contained all the winds. Would you like me to tell 
<A NAME="174"></A>you what I had wrapped up in a handkerchief and entrusted to the care of 
<A NAME="175"></A>Pontianus' household gods? You shall have your will.
<A NAME="176"></A><BR><BR>I have been initiated into various of the Greek mysteries, and 
<A NAME="177"></A>preserve with the utmost care certain emblems and mementoes of my initiation 
<A NAME="178"></A>with which the priests presented me. There is nothing abnormal or unheard 
<A NAME="179"></A>of in this. Those of you here present who have been initiated into the 
<A NAME="180"></A>mysteries of father Liber alone, know what you keep hidden at home, safe 
<A NAME="181"></A>from all profane touch and the object of your silent veneration. But I, 
<A NAME="182"></A>as I have said, moved by my religious fervour and my desire to know the 
<A NAME="183"></A>truth, have learned mysteries of many a kind, rites in great number, and 
<A NAME="184"></A>diverse ceremonies. This is no invention on the spur of the moment; nearly 
<A NAME="185"></A>three years since, in a public discourse on the greatness of Aesculapius 
<A NAME="186"></A>delivered by me during the first days of my residence at Oea, I made the 
<A NAME="187"></A>same boast and recounted the number of the mysteries I knew. That discourse 
<A NAME="188"></A>was thronged, has been read far and wide, is in all men's hands, and has 
<A NAME="189"></A>won the affections of the pious inhabitants of Oea not so much through 
<A NAME="190"></A>any eloquence of mine as because it treats of Aesculapius.
<A NAME="191"></A><BR><BR>Will anyone, who chances to remember it, repeat the beginning of 
<A NAME="192"></A>that particular passage in my discourse? You hear, Maximus, how many voices 
<A NAME="193"></A>supply the words. I will order this same passage to be read aloud, since 
<A NAME="194"></A>by the courteous expression of your face you show that you will not be 
<A NAME="195"></A>displeased to hear it.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="196"></A><B>Part 56</B>

<A NAME="197"></A><BR><BR>Can anyone, who has the least remembrance of the nature of religious 
<A NAME="198"></A>rites, be surprised that one who has been initiated into so many holy mysteries 
<A NAME="199"></A>should preserve at home certain talismans associated with these ceremonies, 
<A NAME="200"></A>and should wrap them in a linen cloth, the purest of coverings for holy 
<A NAME="201"></A>things? For wool, produced by the most stolid of creatures and stripped 
<A NAME="202"></A>from the sheep's back, the followers of Orpheus and Pythagoras are for 
<A NAME="203"></A>that very reason forbidden to wear as being unholy and unclean. But flax, 
<A NAME="204"></A>the purest of all growths and among the best of all the fruits of the earth, 
<A NAME="205"></A>is used by the holy priests of Egypt, not only for clothing and raiment, 
<A NAME="206"></A>but as a veil for sacred things.
<A NAME="207"></A><BR><BR>And yet I know that some persons, among them that fellow Aemilianus, 
<A NAME="208"></A>think it a good jest to mock at things divine. For I learn from certain 
<A NAME="209"></A>men of Oea who know him, that to this day he has never prayed to any god 
<A NAME="210"></A>or frequented any temple, while if he chances to pass any shrine, he regards 
<A NAME="211"></A>it as a crime to raise his hand to his lips in token of reverence. He has 
<A NAME="212"></A>never given firstfruits of crops or vines or flocks to any of the gods 
<A NAME="213"></A>of the farmer, who feed him and clothe him; his farm holds no shrine, no 
<A NAME="214"></A>holy place, nor grove. But why do I speak of groves or shrines? Those who 
<A NAME="215"></A>have been on his property say they never saw there one stone where offering 
<A NAME="216"></A>of oil has been made, one bough where wreaths have been hung. As a result, 
<A NAME="217"></A>two nicknames have been given him: he is called Charon, as I have said, 
<A NAME="218"></A>on account of his truculence of spirit and of countenance, but he is also 
<A NAME="219"></A>-- and this is the name he prefers -- called Mezentius, because he despises 
<A NAME="220"></A>the gods. I therefore find it the easier to understand that he should regard 
<A NAME="221"></A>my list of initiations in the light of a jest. It is even possible that, 
<A NAME="222"></A>thanks to his rejection of things divine, he may be unable to induce himself 
<A NAME="223"></A>to believe that it is true that I guard so reverently so many emblems and 
<A NAME="224"></A>relics of mysterious rites.
<A NAME="225"></A><BR><BR>But what Mezentius may think of me, I do not care a straw; to others 
<A NAME="226"></A>I make this announcement clearly and unshrinkingly: if any of you that 
<A NAME="227"></A>are here present had any part with me in these same solemn ceremonies, 
<A NAME="228"></A>give a sign and you shall hear what it is I keep thus. For no thought of 
<A NAME="229"></A>personal safety shall induce me to reveal to the uninitiated the secrets 
<A NAME="230"></A>that I have received and sworn to conceal.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="231"></A><B>Part 57</B>

<A NAME="232"></A><BR><BR>I have, I think, Maximus, said enough to satisfy the most prejudiced 
<A NAME="233"></A>of men and, as far as the handkerchief is concerned, have cleared myself 
<A NAME="234"></A>of every speck of guilt. I shall run no risk in passing from the suspicions 
<A NAME="235"></A>of Aemilianus to the evidence of Crassus, which my accusers read out next 
<A NAME="236"></A>as if it were of the utmost importance.
<A NAME="237"></A><BR><BR>You heard them read from a written deposition, the evidence of 
<A NAME="238"></A>a gorging brute, a hopeless glutton, named Junius Crassus, that I performed 
<A NAME="239"></A>certain nocturnal rites at his house in company with my friend Appius Quintianus, 
<A NAME="240"></A>who had taken lodgings there. This, mark you, Crassus says that he discovered 
<A NAME="241"></A>(in spite of the fact that he was as far away as Alexandria at the time!) 
<A NAME="242"></A>from finding the feathers of birds and traces of the smoke of a torch. 
<A NAME="243"></A>I suppose that while he was enjoying a round of festivities at Alexandria 
<A NAME="244"></A>-- for Crassus is one who is ready even to encroach upon the daylight with 
<A NAME="245"></A>his gluttonies -- I suppose, I say, that there from his reeking-tavern 
<A NAME="246"></A>he espied, with eye keen as any fowler's, feathers of birds wafted towards 
<A NAME="247"></A>him from his house, and saw the smoke of his home rising far off from his 
<A NAME="248"></A>ancestral rooftree. If he saw this with his eyes, he saw even further than 
<A NAME="249"></A>Ulysses prayed and yearned to see. For Ulysses spent years in gazing vainly 
<A NAME="250"></A>from the shore to see the smoke rising from his home, while Crassus during 
<A NAME="251"></A>a few months' absence from home succeeded, without the least difficulty, 
<A NAME="252"></A>in seeing this same smoke as he sat in a wine-shop! If, on the other hand, 
<A NAME="253"></A>it was his nose that discerned the smoke, he surpasses hounds and vultures 
<A NAME="254"></A>in the keenness of his sense of smell. For what hound, what vulture hovering 
<A NAME="255"></A>in the Alexandrian sky, could sniff out anything so far distant as Oea? 
<A NAME="256"></A>Crassus is, I admit, a gourmand of the first order, and an expert in all 
<A NAME="257"></A>the varied flavours of kitchen-smoke, but in view of his love of drinking, 
<A NAME="258"></A>his only real title to fame, it would have been easier to reach him at 
<A NAME="259"></A>Alexandria for the fumes of his wine rather than the fumes of his 
<A NAME="260"></A>chimney.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="261"></A><B>Part 58</B>

<A NAME="262"></A><BR><BR>Even he saw that this would pass belief. For he is said to have 
<A NAME="263"></A>sold this evidence before eight in the morning while he was still fasting 
<A NAME="264"></A>from food and drink! And so he wrote that he had made his discovery in 
<A NAME="265"></A>the following manner. On his return from Alexandria he went straight to 
<A NAME="266"></A>his house, which Quintianus had by this time left. There in the entrance-hall 
<A NAME="267"></A>he came across a large quantity of birds' feathers: the walls, moreover, 
<A NAME="268"></A>were blackened with soot. He asked the reason of this from the slave whom 
<A NAME="269"></A>he had left at Oea, and the latter informed him of the nocturnal rites 
<A NAME="270"></A>carried out by myself and Quintianus.
<A NAME="271"></A><BR><BR>What an ingenious lie! What a probable invention! That I, had I 
<A NAME="272"></A>wished to do anything of the sort, should have done it there rather than 
<A NAME="273"></A>in my own house! That Quintianus, who is supporting me here today, and 
<A NAME="274"></A>whom I mention with the greatest respect and honour for the close love 
<A NAME="275"></A>that binds him to me, for his deep erudition and consummate eloquence, 
<A NAME="276"></A>that this same Quintianus, supposing him to have dined off some birds or, 
<A NAME="277"></A>as they assert, killed them for magical purposes, should have had no slave 
<A NAME="278"></A>to sweep up the feathers and throw them out of doors! Or further that the 
<A NAME="279"></A>smoke should have been strong enough to blacken the walls and that Quintianus 
<A NAME="280"></A>should have suffered such defacement of his bedroom for as long as he lived 
<A NAME="281"></A>there! Nonsense, Aemilianus! There is no probability in the story, unless 
<A NAME="282"></A>indeed Crassus on his return went not to the bedroom, but after his fashion 
<A NAME="283"></A>made straight for the kitchen.
<A NAME="284"></A><BR><BR>And what made his slave suspect that the walls had been blackened 
<A NAME="285"></A>by night in particular? Was it the colour of the smoke? Does night smoke 
<A NAME="286"></A>differ from day smoke in being darker? And why did so suspicious and conscientious 
<A NAME="287"></A>a slave allow Quintianus to leave the house before having it cleaned? Why 
<A NAME="288"></A>did those feathers lie like lead and await the arrival of Crassus for so 
<A NAME="289"></A>long? Let not Crassus accuse his slave. It is much more likely that he 
<A NAME="290"></A>himself fabricated this mendacious nonsense about feathers and soot, being 
<A NAME="291"></A>unable even in his evidence to divorce himself further from his 
<A NAME="292"></A>kitchen.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="293"></A><B>Part 59</B>

<A NAME="294"></A><BR><BR>And why did you read out this evidence from a written deposition? 
<A NAME="295"></A>Where in the world is Crassus? Has he returned to Alexandria out of disgust 
<A NAME="296"></A>at the state of his house? Is he washing his walls? Or, as is more likely, 
<A NAME="297"></A>is the glutton feeling ill after his debauch? I myself saw him yesterday 
<A NAME="298"></A>here at Sabrata belching in your face, Aemilianus, in the most conspicuous 
<A NAME="299"></A>manner in the middle of the market-place. Pray, Maximus, ask your slaves 
<A NAME="300"></A>whose duty it is to keep you informed of people's names -- although, I 
<A NAME="301"></A>admit, Crassus is better known to the keepers of taverns -- yet ask them, 
<A NAME="302"></A>I say, whether they have ever seen Junius Crassus, a citizen of Oea, in 
<A NAME="303"></A>this place. They will answer `yes'. Let Aemilianus then produce this most 
<A NAME="304"></A>admirable young man on whose testimony he relies.
<A NAME="305"></A><BR><BR>You notice the time of day. I tell you that Crassus has long since 
<A NAME="306"></A>been snoring in a drunken slumber or has taken a second bathe and is now 
<A NAME="307"></A>evaporating the sweat of intoxication at the bath that he may be equal 
<A NAME="308"></A>to a fresh drinking bout after supper. He presents himself in writing only. 
<A NAME="309"></A>That is the way he speaks to you, Maximus. Even he is not so dead to sense 
<A NAME="310"></A>of shame as to be able to lie to your face without a blush. But there is 
<A NAME="311"></A>perhaps another reason for his absence. He may have been unable to abstain 
<A NAME="312"></A>from drunkenness sufficiently long to keep sober against this 
<A NAME="313"></A>moment.
<A NAME="314"></A><BR><BR>Or it may be that Aemilianus took good care not to subject him 
<A NAME="315"></A>to your severe and searching gaze, lest you should damn the brute with 
<A NAME="316"></A>his close-shaven cheeks and his disgusting appearance by a mere glance 
<A NAME="317"></A>at his face, when you saw a young man with his features stripped of the 
<A NAME="318"></A>beard and hair that should adorn them, his eyes heavy with wine, his lids 
<A NAME="319"></A>swollen, his &lt;...&gt; grin, his slobbering lips, his harsh voice, his 
<A NAME="320"></A>trembling hands, his breath reeking of the cook-shop. He has long since 
<A NAME="321"></A>devoured his fortune; nothing is left him of his patrimony save a house 
<A NAME="322"></A>that serves him for the sale of his false witness, and never did he make 
<A NAME="323"></A>a more remunerative contract than he has done with regard to this evidence 
<A NAME="324"></A>he offers today. For he sold Aemilianus his drunken fictions for 3,000 
<A NAME="325"></A>sesterces, as every one at Oea is aware.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="326"></A><B>Part 60</B>

<A NAME="327"></A><BR><BR>We all knew of this before it actually took place. I might have 
<A NAME="328"></A>prevented the transaction by denouncing it, but I knew that so foolish 
<A NAME="329"></A>a lie would be prejudicial to Aemilianus, who wasted his money to secure 
<A NAME="330"></A>it, rather than to myself, who treated it with the contempt it deserved. 
<A NAME="331"></A>I wished not only that Aemilianus should lose his money, but that Crassus 
<A NAME="332"></A>should have his reputation ruined by his disgraceful perjury. It was but 
<A NAME="333"></A>the day before yesterday that the transaction took place in the most open 
<A NAME="334"></A>manner at the house of Rufinus, of whom I shall soon have something to 
<A NAME="335"></A>say. Rufinus and Calpurnianus acted as middlemen and entreated him to comply 
<A NAME="336"></A>to their wishes. The former carried out the task with all the more readiness 
<A NAME="337"></A>because he was certain that his wife, at whose misconduct he knowingly 
<A NAME="338"></A>connives, would be sure to recover from Crassus a large proportion of his 
<A NAME="339"></A>fee for perjury.
<A NAME="340"></A><BR><BR>I noticed that you also, Maximus, as soon as this written evidence 
<A NAME="341"></A>was produced, suspected with your usual acuteness that they had formed 
<A NAME="342"></A>a league and conspiracy against me; and I saw from your face that the whole 
<A NAME="343"></A>affair excited your disgust. Finally my accusers, in spite of their being 
<A NAME="344"></A>paragons of audacity and monsters of shamelessness, noticed that Crassus' 
<A NAME="345"></A>evidence smelled after faex and did not dare to read it out in full or 
<A NAME="346"></A>to build anything upon it. I have mentioned these facts not because I am 
<A NAME="347"></A>afraid of these dreadful feathers and stains of soot -- least of all with 
<A NAME="348"></A>you to judge me -- but that Crassus might meet with due punishment for 
<A NAME="349"></A>having sold mere smoke to a helpless rustic like Aemilianus.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="350"></A><B>Part 61</B>

<A NAME="351"></A><BR><BR>And after all this, they have also come up, on reading Pudentilla's 
<A NAME="352"></A>letters, concerning the manufacture of a seal.  This seal, they assert, 
<A NAME="353"></A>I had fashioned of the rarest wood by some secret process for purposes 
<A NAME="354"></A>of the black art. They add that, although it is loathly and horrible to 
<A NAME="355"></A>look upon, being in the form of a skeleton, I yet give it especial honour 
<A NAME="356"></A>and call it in the Greek tongue, basileus, my king. I think I am right 
<A NAME="357"></A>in saying that I am following the various stages of their accusation in 
<A NAME="358"></A>due order and reconstructing the whole fabric of their slander detail by 
<A NAME="359"></A>detail.
<A NAME="360"></A><BR><BR>Now how can the manufacture of this seal have been secret, as you 
<A NAME="361"></A>assert, when you are sufficiently well acquainted with the maker to have 
<A NAME="362"></A>summoned him to appear in court? Here is Cornelius Saturninus, the artist, 
<A NAME="363"></A>a man whose skill is famous among his townsfolk and whose character is 
<A NAME="364"></A>above reproach. A little while back, in answer, Maximus, to your careful 
<A NAME="365"></A>cross-examination, he explained the whole sequence of events in the most 
<A NAME="366"></A>convincing and truthful manner. He said that I visited his shop and, after 
<A NAME="367"></A>looking at many geometrical patterns all carved out of boxwood in the most 
<A NAME="368"></A>cunning and ingenious manner, was so much attracted by his skill that I 
<A NAME="369"></A>asked him to make me certain mechanical devices and also begged him to 
<A NAME="370"></A>make me the image of some god to which I might pray after my custom. The 
<A NAME="371"></A>particular god and the precise material I left to his choice, my only stipulation 
<A NAME="372"></A>being that it should be made of wood. He therefore first attempted to work 
<A NAME="373"></A>in boxwood. Meanwhile, during my absence in the country, Sicinius Pontianus, 
<A NAME="374"></A>my step-son, wishing it to be made for me, procured some ebony tablets 
<A NAME="375"></A>from that excellent lady Capitolina and brought them to his shop, exhorting 
<A NAME="376"></A>him to make what I had ordered out of this rarer and more durable material: 
<A NAME="377"></A>such a gift, he said, would be most gratifying to me. Our artist did as 
<A NAME="378"></A>Pontianus suggested, as far as the size of the ebony tablets permitted. 
<A NAME="379"></A>By careful dove-tailing of minute portions of the tablets he succeeded 
<A NAME="380"></A>in making a small figure of Mercury.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="381"></A><B>Part 62</B>

<A NAME="382"></A><BR><BR>You heard all the evidence just as I repeat it. Moreover, it receives 
<A NAME="383"></A>exact confirmation from the answers given to you in cross-examination by 
<A NAME="384"></A>Capitolina's son, a youth of the most excellent character, who is here 
<A NAME="385"></A>in court today. He said that Pontianus asked for the tablets, that Pontianus 
<A NAME="386"></A>took them to the artist Saturninus. Nor does he deny that Pontianus received 
<A NAME="387"></A>the completed signet from Saturninus and afterwards gave it 
<A NAME="388"></A>me.
<A NAME="389"></A><BR><BR>All these things have been openly and manifestly proved. What remains, 
<A NAME="390"></A>in which any suspicion of sorcery can lie concealed? Nay, what is there 
<A NAME="391"></A>that does not absolutely convict you of obvious falsehood? You said that 
<A NAME="392"></A>the seal was of secret manufacture, whereas Pontianus, a distinguished 
<A NAME="393"></A>member of the equestrian order, gave the commission for it. The figure 
<A NAME="394"></A>was carved in public by Saturninus as he sat in his shop. He is a man of 
<A NAME="395"></A>sterling character and recognized honesty. The work was assisted by the 
<A NAME="396"></A>munificence of a distinguished married lady, and many both among the slaves 
<A NAME="397"></A>and the acquaintances who frequented my house were aware both of the commission 
<A NAME="398"></A>for the work and its execution. You were not ashamed falsely to pretend 
<A NAME="399"></A>that I had searched high and low for the requisite wood through all the 
<A NAME="400"></A>town, although you know that I was absent from Oea at that time, and although 
<A NAME="401"></A>it has been proved that I gave a free hand as to the 
<A NAME="402"></A>material.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="403"></A><B>Part 63</B>

<A NAME="404"></A><BR><BR>Your third lie was that the figure which was made was the lean, 
<A NAME="405"></A>eviscerated frame of a gruesome corpse, utterly horrible and ghastly as 
<A NAME="406"></A>any ghost. If you had discovered such definite proof of my sorceries, why 
<A NAME="407"></A>did you not insist on my producing it in court? Was it that you might have 
<A NAME="408"></A>complete freedom for inventing lies in the absence of the subject of your 
<A NAME="409"></A>slanders? If so, the opportunity afforded you for mendacity has been lost 
<A NAME="410"></A>you, thanks to a certain habit of mine which comes in most opportunely. 
<A NAME="411"></A>It is my wont wherever I go to carry with me the image of some god kept 
<A NAME="412"></A>among my books and to pray to him on feast days with offerings of incense 
<A NAME="413"></A>and wine and sometimes even of victims. When, therefore, I heard persistent 
<A NAME="414"></A>though outrageously mendacious assertions that the figure I carried was 
<A NAME="415"></A>that of a skeleton, I ordered some one to go and bring from my house my 
<A NAME="416"></A>little image of Mercury, the same that Saturninus had made for me at Oea. 
<A NAME="417"></A>You here, give it them! Let them see it, hold it, examine it. There you 
<A NAME="418"></A>see the image which that scoundrel called a skeleton. Do you hear these 
<A NAME="419"></A>cries of protest that arise from all present? Do you hear the condemnation 
<A NAME="420"></A>of your lie? Are you not at last ashamed of all your slanders? Is this 
<A NAME="421"></A>a skeleton, this a ghost, is this the familiar spirit you asserted it to 
<A NAME="422"></A>be? Is this a magic symbol or one that is common and 
<A NAME="423"></A>ordinary?
<A NAME="424"></A><BR><BR>Take it, I beg you, Maximus, and examine it. It is good that a 
<A NAME="425"></A>holy thing should be entrusted to hands as pure and pious as yours. See 
<A NAME="426"></A>there, how fair it is to view, how full of all a wrestler's grace and vigour! 
<A NAME="427"></A>How cheerful is the god's face, how comely the down that creeps on either 
<A NAME="428"></A>side his cheeks, how the curled hair shows upon his head beneath the shadow 
<A NAME="429"></A>of his hat's brim, how neatly the tiny pair of pinions project about his 
<A NAME="430"></A>brows, how daintily the cloak is drawn about his shoulders! He who dares 
<A NAME="431"></A>call this a skeleton, either never sees an image of a god or if he does 
<A NAME="432"></A>ignores it. Indeed, he who thinks this to represent a ghost is evoking 
<A NAME="433"></A>ghosts.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="434"></A><B>Part 64</B>

<A NAME="435"></A><BR><BR>But in return for that lie, Aemilianus, may that same god who goes 
<A NAME="436"></A>between the lords of heaven and the lords of hell grant you the hatred 
<A NAME="437"></A>of the gods of either world and ever send to meet you the shadows of the 
<A NAME="438"></A>dead with all the shades, with all the fiends, with all the spectrets, 
<A NAME="439"></A>with all the ghosts of all the world, and thrust upon your eyes all the 
<A NAME="440"></A>terror that walks by night, all the dread dwellers in the tomb, all the 
<A NAME="441"></A>horrors of the sepulchre, although your age and character have brought 
<A NAME="442"></A>you near enough to them already.
<A NAME="443"></A><BR><BR>But we of the family of Plato know naught save what is bright and 
<A NAME="444"></A>joyous, majestic and heavenly and of the world above us. Nay, in its zeal 
<A NAME="445"></A>to reach the heights of wisdom, the Platonic school has explored regions 
<A NAME="446"></A>higher than heaven itself and has stood triumphant on the outer circumference 
<A NAME="447"></A>of this our universe. Maximus knows that I speak truth, for in his careful 
<A NAME="448"></A>study of the Phaedrus he has read of the `place being builded on heaven's 
<A NAME="449"></A>back.' Maximus also clearly understands -- I am now going to reply to your 
<A NAME="450"></A>accusation about the name -- who he is whom not I but Plato was first to 
<A NAME="451"></A>call the `King'. `All things,' he says, `depend upon the King of all things 
<A NAME="452"></A>and for him only all things exist.' Maximus knows who that `King' is, even 
<A NAME="453"></A>the cause and reason and primal origin of all nature, the lord and father 
<A NAME="454"></A>of the soul, the eternal saviour of all that lives, the unwearying builder 
<A NAME="455"></A>of his world. Yet he builds without labour, yet he saves without care, 
<A NAME="456"></A>he is father without begetting, he knows no limitation of space or time 
<A NAME="457"></A>or change, and therefore few may conceive and none may tell of his 
<A NAME="458"></A>power.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="459"></A><B>Part 65</B>

<A NAME="460"></A><BR><BR>I will even go out of my way to aggravate the suspicion of sorcery; 
<A NAME="461"></A>I will not tell you, Aemilianus, who it is that I worship as my king. Even 
<A NAME="462"></A>if the proconsul should ask me himself who my god is, I am 
<A NAME="463"></A>dumb.
<A NAME="464"></A><BR><BR>About the name I have said enough for the present. For the rest 
<A NAME="465"></A>I know that some of my audience are anxious to hear why I wanted the figure 
<A NAME="466"></A>made not of silver or gold, but only of wood, though I think that their 
<A NAME="467"></A>desire springs not so much from their anxiety to see me cleared of guilt 
<A NAME="468"></A>as from eagerness for knowledge. They would like to have this last doubt 
<A NAME="469"></A>removed, even although they see that I have amply rebutted all suspicion 
<A NAME="470"></A>of any crime. Listen, then, you who would know, but listen with all the 
<A NAME="471"></A>sharpness and attention that you may, for you are to hear the very words 
<A NAME="472"></A>that Plato wrote in his old age in the last book of the 
<A NAME="473"></A>Laws.
<A NAME="474"></A><BR><BR>The man of moderate means when he makes offerings to the gods should 
<A NAME="475"></A>do so in proportion to his means. Now, earth and the household hearths 
<A NAME="476"></A>of all men are holy to all the gods. Let no one therefore dedicate any 
<A NAME="477"></A>shrines to the gods over and above these.
<A NAME="478"></A><BR><BR>He forbids this with the purpose of preventing men from venturing 
<A NAME="479"></A>to build private shrines; for he thinks that the public temples suffice 
<A NAME="480"></A>his citizens for the purposes of sacrifice. He then 
<A NAME="481"></A>continues,
<A NAME="482"></A><BR><BR>Gold and silver in other cities, whether in the keeping of private 
<A NAME="483"></A>persons or of temples, are invidious possessions; ivory taken from a body 
<A NAME="484"></A>wherefrom the life has passed is not a welcome offering; iron and bronze 
<A NAME="485"></A>are instruments of war. Whatsoever a man dedicates, let it be of wood and 
<A NAME="486"></A>wood only, or if it be of stone, of stone only.
<A NAME="487"></A><BR><BR>The general murmur of assent shows, Maximus, and you, gentlemen, 
<A NAME="488"></A>who have the honour to assist him, that I am adjudged to have made admirable 
<A NAME="489"></A>use of Plato, not only as a guide in life, but as an advocate in court, 
<A NAME="490"></A>to whose laws, as you see, I obey.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="491"></A><B>Part 66</B>

<A NAME="492"></A><BR><BR>It is now time for me to turn first and foremost to the letters 
<A NAME="493"></A>of Pudentilla, or rather to retrace the whole course of events a little 
<A NAME="494"></A>further back still. For I desire to make it abundantly clear that I, whom 
<A NAME="495"></A>they keep accusing of having forced my way into Pudentilla's house solely 
<A NAME="496"></A>through love of money, ought really never to have come near that house, 
<A NAME="497"></A>had the thought of money ever crossed my mind. My marriage has for many 
<A NAME="498"></A>reasons brought me the reverse of prosperity and, but for the fact that 
<A NAME="499"></A>my wife's virtues are compensation for any number of disadvantages, it 
<A NAME="500"></A>would be contrary to my interests.
<A NAME="501"></A><BR><BR>Disappointment and envy are the sole causes that have involved 
<A NAME="502"></A>me in this trial, and even before that gathered many mortal perils about 
<A NAME="503"></A>my path. What motiva for resentment has Aemilianus against me, even assuming 
<A NAME="504"></A>him to be correctly informed when he accuses me of magic? No least word 
<A NAME="505"></A>of mine has ever injured him in such a way as to give him the appearance 
<A NAME="506"></A>of pursuing a just revenge. It is certainly no lofty ambition that prompts 
<A NAME="507"></A>him to accuse me, ambition such as fired Marcus Antonius to accuse Cnaeus 
<A NAME="508"></A>Carbo, Caius Mucius to accuse Aulus Albucius, Publius Sulpicius to accuse 
<A NAME="509"></A>Cnaeus Norbanus, Caius Furius to accuse Marcus Aquilius, Caius Curio to 
<A NAME="510"></A>accuse Quintus Metellus. They were young men of admirable education and 
<A NAME="511"></A>were led by ambition to undertake these accusations as the first step in 
<A NAME="512"></A>a forensic career, that by the conduct of some `cause celebre' they might 
<A NAME="513"></A>make themselves a name among their fellow citizens. This privilege was 
<A NAME="514"></A>conceded by antiquity to young men just entering public life as a means 
<A NAME="515"></A>of winning glory for their youthful genius. The custom has long since become 
<A NAME="516"></A>obsolete, but even if the practice were still common, it would not apply 
<A NAME="517"></A>to Aemilianus. It would not have been becoming to him to make any display 
<A NAME="518"></A>of his eloquence, for he is rude and unlettered; nor to show a passion 
<A NAME="519"></A>for renown, since he is a mere barbarian bumpkin; nor thus to open his 
<A NAME="520"></A>career as an advocate, for he is an old man on the brink of the grave. 
<A NAME="521"></A>The only hypothesis creditable to him would be that he is perhaps giving 
<A NAME="522"></A>an example of his austerity of character and has undertaken this accusation 
<A NAME="523"></A>through sheer hatred of wrongdoing and to assert his own integrity. But 
<A NAME="524"></A>I should hardly accept such an hypothesis even in the case of a greater 
<A NAME="525"></A>Aemilianus, not our African friend here, but the conqueror of Africa and 
<A NAME="526"></A>Numantia, who held, moreover, the office of censor at Rome. Much less will 
<A NAME="527"></A>I believe that this dull blockhead, I will not say, hates sin, but recognizes 
<A NAME="528"></A>it when he sees it.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="529"></A><B>Part 67</B>

<A NAME="530"></A><BR><BR>What then was his motive? It is as clear as day to any one that 
<A NAME="531"></A>envy is the sole motive that has spurred him and Herennius Rufinus, his 
<A NAME="532"></A>instigator -- of whom I shall have more to say later -- and the rest of 
<A NAME="533"></A>my enemies, to fabricate these false charges of sorcery.
<A NAME="534"></A><BR><BR>Well, there are five points which I must discuss. If I remember 
<A NAME="535"></A>aright, their accusations as regards Pudentilla were as follows. Firstly, 
<A NAME="536"></A>they said that after the death of her first husband she resolutely set 
<A NAME="537"></A>her face against re-marriage, but was seduced by my incantations. Secondly, 
<A NAME="538"></A>there are her letters, which they regard as an admission that I used sorcery. 
<A NAME="539"></A>Thirdly and fourthly, they object that she made a lovematch at the advanced 
<A NAME="540"></A>age of sixty and that the marriage contract was sealed not in the town 
<A NAME="541"></A>but at a country house. Lastly, there is the most invidious of all these 
<A NAME="542"></A>accusations, namely, that which concerns the dowry. It is into this charge 
<A NAME="543"></A>they have put all their force and all their venom; it is this that vexes 
<A NAME="544"></A>them most of all. They assert that at the very outset of our wedded life 
<A NAME="545"></A>I forced my devoted wife in the absolute seclusion of her country house 
<A NAME="546"></A>to make over to me a large dowry.
<A NAME="547"></A><BR><BR>I will show that all these statements are so false, so worthless, 
<A NAME="548"></A>so unsubstantial, and I shall refute them so easily and unquestionably, 
<A NAME="549"></A>that in good truth, Maximus, and you, gentlemen, his assessors, I fear 
<A NAME="550"></A>you may think that I have suborned my accusers to bring these charges, 
<A NAME="551"></A>that I might have the opportunity of publicly dispelling the hatred of 
<A NAME="552"></A>which I am the victim. I will ask you to believe now what you will understand 
<A NAME="553"></A>when the facts are before you, that I shall need to put out all my strength 
<A NAME="554"></A>to prevent you from thinking that such a baseless accusation is a cunning 
<A NAME="555"></A>device of my own rather than a stupid enterprise of my 
<A NAME="556"></A>enemies.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="557"></A><B>Part 68</B>

<A NAME="558"></A><BR><BR>I shall now briefly retrace events and force Aemilianus himself 
<A NAME="559"></A>to admit, whenhe has heard the facts, that his envy was groundless and 
<A NAME="560"></A>that he has strayed far from the truth. In the meantime I beg you, as you 
<A NAME="561"></A>have already done, or if possible yet more than you have already done, 
<A NAME="562"></A>to give the best of your attention to me as I trace the whole case to its 
<A NAME="563"></A>fount and source.
<A NAME="564"></A><BR><BR>Aemilia Pudentilla, now my wife, was once the wife of a certain 
<A NAME="565"></A>Sicinius Amicus. By him she had two sons, Pontianus and Pudens. These two 
<A NAME="566"></A>boys were left by their father's death under the guardianship of their 
<A NAME="567"></A>paternal grandfather -- for Amicus predeceased his father -- and were brought 
<A NAME="568"></A>up by their mother with remarkable care and affection for about fourteen 
<A NAME="569"></A>years. She was in the flower of her age, and it was not of her own choosing 
<A NAME="570"></A>that she remained a widow for so long. But the boys' grandfather was eager 
<A NAME="571"></A>that she should, in spite of her reluctance, take his son, Sicinius Clarus, 
<A NAME="572"></A>for her second husband and with this in view kept all other suitors at 
<A NAME="573"></A>a distance. He further threatened her that if she married elsewhere he 
<A NAME="574"></A>would by his will exclude her sons from the possession of any of their 
<A NAME="575"></A>father's heritage. When she saw that nothing could move him to alter the 
<A NAME="576"></A>condition that he had laid down, such was her wisdom, and so admirable 
<A NAME="577"></A>her maternal affection, that to prevent her sons' interests suffering any 
<A NAME="578"></A>damage in this respect, she made a contract of marriage with Sicinius Clarus 
<A NAME="579"></A>in accordance with her father-in-law's bidding, but by various evasions 
<A NAME="580"></A>managed to avoid the marriage until the boys' grandfather died, leaving 
<A NAME="581"></A>them as his heirs, with the result that Pontianus, the elder son, became 
<A NAME="582"></A>his brother's guardian.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="583"></A><B>Part 69</B>

<A NAME="584"></A><BR><BR>She was now freed from all embarrassment, and being sought in marriage 
<A NAME="585"></A>by many distinguished persons resolved to remain a widow no longer. The 
<A NAME="586"></A>dreariness of her solitary life she might have borne, but her bodily infirmities 
<A NAME="587"></A>had become intolerable. This chaste and saintly lady, after so many years 
<A NAME="588"></A>of blameless widowhood, without even a breath of scandal, owing to her 
<A NAME="589"></A>long absence from a husband's embraces, began to suffer internal pains 
<A NAME="590"></A>so severe that they brought her to the brink of the grave. Doctors and 
<A NAME="591"></A>wise women agreed that the disease had its origin in her long widowhood, 
<A NAME="592"></A>that the evil was increasing daily and her sickness steadily assuming a 
<A NAME="593"></A>more serious character; the remedy was that she should marry before her 
<A NAME="594"></A>youth finally departed from her.
<A NAME="595"></A><BR><BR>There were many who welcomed this recommendation, but none more 
<A NAME="596"></A>so than that fellow Aemilianus, who a little while back asserted with the 
<A NAME="597"></A>most unhesitating mendacity that Pudentilla had never thought of marriage 
<A NAME="598"></A>until I compelled her to be mine by my exercise of the black art; that 
<A NAME="599"></A>I alone had been found to outrage the virgin purity of her widowhood by 
<A NAME="600"></A>incantations and love philtres. I have often heard it said with truth that 
<A NAME="601"></A>a liar should have a good memory. Had you forgotten, Aemilianus, that before 
<A NAME="602"></A>I came to Oea, you wrote to her son Pontianus, who had then attained to 
<A NAME="603"></A>man's estate and was pursuing his studies at Rome, suggesting that she 
<A NAME="604"></A>should marry?
<A NAME="605"></A><BR><BR>Give me the letter, or better give it to Aemilianus and let him 
<A NAME="606"></A>refute himself in his own voice with his own words. Is this your letter? 
<A NAME="607"></A>Why do you turn pale? We know you are past blushing. Is this your signature? 
<A NAME="608"></A>Read a little louder, please, that all may realize how his written words 
<A NAME="609"></A>belie his speech and how much more he is at variance with himself than 
<A NAME="610"></A>with me.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="611"></A><B>Part 70</B>

<A NAME="612"></A><BR><BR>Did you, Aemilianus, write what has just been read out? `I know 
<A NAME="613"></A>that she is willing to marry and that she ought to do so, but I do not 
<A NAME="614"></A>know the object of her choice.' You were right there. You knew nothing 
<A NAME="615"></A>about it. For Pudentilla, though she admitted that she wished to marry 
<A NAME="616"></A>again, said nothing to you about her suitor. She knew the intrusive malignity 
<A NAME="617"></A>of your nature too well. But you still expected her to marry your brother 
<A NAME="618"></A>Clarus and were induced by your false hopes to go further and to urge her 
<A NAME="619"></A>son to assent to the match.
<A NAME="620"></A><BR><BR>And of course, if she had wedded Clarus, a boorish and decrepit 
<A NAME="621"></A>old man, you would have asserted that she had long desired to marry him 
<A NAME="622"></A>of her own free will without the intervention of any magic. But now that 
<A NAME="623"></A>she has married a young man of the elegance which you attribute to him, 
<A NAME="624"></A>you say that she had always refused to marry and must have done so under 
<A NAME="625"></A>compulsion! You did not know, you villain, that the letter you had written 
<A NAME="626"></A>on the subject was being preserved, you did not know that you would be 
<A NAME="627"></A>convicted by your own testimony. The fact is that Pudentilla, knowing your 
<A NAME="628"></A>changeableness and unreliability no less than your shamelessness and mendacity, 
<A NAME="629"></A>rather than forward the letter preferred to keep it as clear evidence of 
<A NAME="630"></A>your intentions.
<A NAME="631"></A><BR><BR>Furthermore, she wrote a letter of her own on the same subject 
<A NAME="632"></A>to her son Pontianus at Rome, in which she gave full reasons for her determination. 
<A NAME="633"></A>She told him pretty fully about the state of her health; there was no longer 
<A NAME="634"></A>any reason for her to persist in remaining a widow; she had so remained 
<A NAME="635"></A>for thus long and had sacrificed her health solely to procure him the inheritance 
<A NAME="636"></A>of his grandfather's fortune, a fortune to which she had by the exercise 
<A NAME="637"></A>of the greatest care made considerable additions; Pontianus himself was 
<A NAME="638"></A>now by the grace of heaven ripe for marriage and his brother for the garb 
<A NAME="639"></A>of manhood; she begged them to suffer her at length to solace her lonely 
<A NAME="640"></A>existence and to relieve her ill health; they need have no fears as to 
<A NAME="641"></A>her final choice or as to her motherly affection; she would still be as 
<A NAME="642"></A>a wife what she had been as a widow. I will order a copy of this letter 
<A NAME="643"></A>to her son to be read aloud.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="644"></A><B>Part 71</B>

<A NAME="645"></A><BR><BR>This letter makes it, I think, sufficiently clear that it needed 
<A NAME="646"></A>no incantations of mine to move Pudentilla from her resolve to remain a 
<A NAME="647"></A>widow, but that she had been for some time by no means averse to marriage, 
<A NAME="648"></A>when she chose me -- it may be in preference to others. I cannot see why 
<A NAME="649"></A>such a choice by so excellent a woman should be brought against me as matter 
<A NAME="650"></A>for reproach rather than honour. But I admit feeling surprise that Aemilianus 
<A NAME="651"></A>and Rufinus should be annoyed at the lady's decision, when those who were 
<A NAME="652"></A>actually suitors for her hand acquiesce in her preference for 
<A NAME="653"></A>myself.
<A NAME="654"></A><BR><BR>She was indeed guided in making her choice less by her personal 
<A NAME="655"></A>inclination than by the advice of her son, a fact which Aemilianus cannot 
<A NAME="656"></A>deny. For Pontianus on receiving his mother's letter hastily flew hither 
<A NAME="657"></A>from Rome, fearing that, if the man of her choice proved to be avaricious, 
<A NAME="658"></A>she might, as often happens, transfer her whole fortune to the house of 
<A NAME="659"></A>her new husband. This anxiety tormented him not a little. All his own expectations 
<A NAME="660"></A>of wealth together with those of his brother depended on his mother. His 
<A NAME="661"></A>grandfather had left but a moderate fortune, his mother possessed 4,000,000 
<A NAME="662"></A>sesterces. Of this sum, it is true, she owed a considerable portion to 
<A NAME="663"></A>her sons, but they had no security for this, relying, naturally enough, 
<A NAME="664"></A>on her word alone. He gave but silent expression to his fears; he did not 
<A NAME="665"></A>venture to show any open opposition for fear of seeming to distrust 
<A NAME="666"></A>her.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="667"></A><B>Part 72</B>

<A NAME="668"></A><BR><BR>Things being in this delicate position owing to the mother's request 
<A NAME="669"></A>and the son's fear, chance or destiny brought me to Oea on my way to Alexandria. 
<A NAME="670"></A>Did not my respect for my wife prevent me, I would say `Would God it had 
<A NAME="671"></A>never happened.' It was winter when this occurred. Overcome by the fatigues 
<A NAME="672"></A>of the journey, I was laid up for a considerable number of days in the 
<A NAME="673"></A>house of my friends the Appii, whom I name to show the affection and esteem 
<A NAME="674"></A>with which I regard them. There Pontianus came to see me; for not so very 
<A NAME="675"></A>long before certain common friends had introduced him to me at Athens, 
<A NAME="676"></A>and we had afterwards lodged together and come to know each other intimately. 
<A NAME="677"></A>He greeted me with the utmost courtesy, inquired anxiously after my health, 
<A NAME="678"></A>and touched dexterously on the subject of love. For he thought that he 
<A NAME="679"></A>had found an ideal husband for his mother to whom he could without the 
<A NAME="680"></A>slightest risk entrust the whole fortune of the house. At first he sounded 
<A NAME="681"></A>me as to my inclinations in somewhat ambiguous language, and seeing that 
<A NAME="682"></A>I was desirous of resuming my journey and was not in the least disposed 
<A NAME="683"></A>to take a wife, he begged me at any rate to remain at Oea for a little 
<A NAME="684"></A>while, as he himself was desirous of travelling with me. Since my physical 
<A NAME="685"></A>infirmity had made it impossible for me to profit by the present winter, 
<A NAME="686"></A>he urged that it would be well to wait for the next owing to the danger 
<A NAME="687"></A>presented by the passage of the Syrtes and the risk of encountering wild 
<A NAME="688"></A>beasts. His urgent entreaty induced my friends the Appii to allow me to 
<A NAME="689"></A>leave them and to become his guest in his mother's house. I should find 
<A NAME="690"></A>the situation healthier, he said, and should get a freer view of the sea 
<A NAME="691"></A>-- a special attraction in my eyes.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="692"></A><B>Part 73</B>

<A NAME="693"></A><BR><BR>He had shown the greatest eagerness in inducing me to come to this 
<A NAME="694"></A>decision, and strongly recommended his mother and his brother -- that boy 
<A NAME="695"></A>there -- to my consideration. I gave them some help in our common studies 
<A NAME="696"></A>and a marked intimacy sprang up between us. Meanwhile I gradually recovered 
<A NAME="697"></A>my health. At the instance of my friends I gave a discourse in public. 
<A NAME="698"></A>This took place in the basilica, which was thronged by a vast audience. 
<A NAME="699"></A>I was greeted with many expressions of approval, the audience shouted `bravo! 
<A NAME="700"></A>bravo!' like one man, and besought me to remain and become a citizen of 
<A NAME="701"></A>Oea. On the dispersal of the audience Pontianus approached me, and by way 
<A NAME="702"></A>of prelude said that such universal enthusiasm was nothing less than a 
<A NAME="703"></A>sign from heaven. He then revealed to me that it was his cherished design 
<A NAME="704"></A>-- with my permission -- to bring about a match between myself and his 
<A NAME="705"></A>mother, for whose hand there were many suitors. He added that I was the 
<A NAME="706"></A>only friend in the world in whom he could put implicit trust and confidence. 
<A NAME="707"></A>If I were to refuse to undertake such a responsibility, simply because 
<A NAME="708"></A>it was no fair heiress that was offered me, but a woman of plain appearance 
<A NAME="709"></A>nd the mother of children -- if I were moved by these considerations and 
<A NAME="710"></A>insisted on reserving myself for a more attractive and wealthier match, 
<A NAME="711"></A>my behaviour would be unworthy of a friend and a philosopher.
<A NAME="712"></A><BR><BR>It would take too long -- even if I were willing to tell you what 
<A NAME="713"></A>I replied and how long and how frequently we conversed on the subject, 
<A NAME="714"></A>with how many pressing entreaties he plied me, never ceasing until he finally 
<A NAME="715"></A>won my consent. I had had ample opportunity for observing Pudentilla's 
<A NAME="716"></A>character, for I had lived for a whole year continually in her company 
<A NAME="717"></A>and had realized how rich was her endowment of good qualities; but my desire 
<A NAME="718"></A>for travel led me to desire to refuse the match as an impediment. But I 
<A NAME="719"></A>soon began to love her for her virtues as ardently as though I had wooed 
<A NAME="720"></A>her of my own initiative. Pontianus had also persuaded his mother to give 
<A NAME="721"></A>me the preference over all her other suitors, and showed extraordinary 
<A NAME="722"></A>eagerness for the marriage to take place at the earliest possible date. 
<A NAME="723"></A>We could scarcely induce him to consent to the very briefest postponement 
<A NAME="724"></A>to such time as he himself should have taken a wife and his brother in 
<A NAME="725"></A>due course have assumed the garb of manhood. That done, we would be married 
<A NAME="726"></A>at once.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="727"></A><B>Part 74</B>

<A NAME="728"></A><BR><BR>Would to heaven it were possible without serious damage to my case 
<A NAME="729"></A>to pass by what I have now to relate. I freely forgave Pontianus when he 
<A NAME="730"></A>begged for pardon, and I have no wish to seem to reproach him now for the 
<A NAME="731"></A>fickleness of his conduct. I acknowledge the truth of a circumstance brought 
<A NAME="732"></A>against me by my accusers, I admit that Pontianus, after taking to himself 
<A NAME="733"></A>a wife, broke his pledged word and suddenly changed his mind; that he tried 
<A NAME="734"></A>to prevent the fulfilment of this project with no less obstinacy than he 
<A NAME="735"></A>had shown zeal in forwarding it. He was ready to make any sacrifice, to 
<A NAME="736"></A>go any lengths, to prevent our marriage taking place. Nevertheless this 
<A NAME="737"></A>discreditable change of attitude, this deliberate quarrel with his mother, 
<A NAME="738"></A>must not be laid to his charge, but to that of his father-in-law, Herennius 
<A NAME="739"></A>Rufinus, whom you see before you, a man than whom no more worthless, wicked, 
<A NAME="740"></A>and crime-stained soul lives upon this earth. I will -- since I cannot 
<A NAME="741"></A>avoid it -- give a brief description of this man's character, using such 
<A NAME="742"></A>moderation as I may, lest, if I pass him by in silence, the energy which 
<A NAME="743"></A>he has shown in engineering this accusation against me should have been 
<A NAME="744"></A>spent all in vain.
<A NAME="745"></A><BR><BR>This is the man who poisoned that worthless boy against me, who 
<A NAME="746"></A>is the prime mover in this accusation, who has hired advocates and bought 
<A NAME="747"></A>witnesses. This is the furnace in which all this calumny has been forged, 
<A NAME="748"></A>this the firebrand, this the scourge that has driven Aemilianus here to 
<A NAME="749"></A>his task. He makes it his boast before all men in the most extravagant 
<A NAME="750"></A>language that it is through his machinations that my indictment has been 
<A NAME="751"></A>procured. In truth he has some reason for self-congratulation. For he is 
<A NAME="752"></A>the organizer of every lawsuit, the deviser of every perjury, the architect 
<A NAME="753"></A>of every lie, the seed-ground of every wickedness, the habitation of lust 
<A NAME="754"></A>and gluttony, a brothel and a house of whores; the mark of every scandal 
<A NAME="755"></A>since his earliest years; in boyhood, ere he became so hideously bald, 
<A NAME="756"></A>the ready servant of his pederasts in the vilest vices; in youth a stage 
<A NAME="757"></A>dancer limp and nerveless enough in all conscience, but, they tell me, 
<A NAME="758"></A>clumsy and inartistic in his very effeminacy. He is said not to have possessed 
<A NAME="759"></A>a single quality that should distinguish an actor, except for his 
<A NAME="760"></A>indecency.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="761"></A><B>Part 75</B>

<A NAME="762"></A><BR><BR>He is older now -- God's curse upon him! I crave your pardon for 
<A NAME="763"></A>my warmth of language. But his house is the dwelling-place of panders, 
<A NAME="764"></A>his whole household foul with sin, himself a man of infamous character, 
<A NAME="765"></A>his wife a harlot, his sons like their parents. His door night and day 
<A NAME="766"></A>is battered with the kicks of wanton gallants, his windows loud with the 
<A NAME="767"></A>sound of loose serenades, his dining-room wild with revel, his bedchambers 
<A NAME="768"></A>the haunt of adulterers. For no one need fear to enter it save he who has 
<A NAME="769"></A>no gift for the husband. Thus does he make an income from the shame of 
<A NAME="770"></A>his own bed. Once he had been good at making money everywhere with his 
<A NAME="771"></A>own body, now with that of wife. With none but him -- it is not a lie! 
<A NAME="772"></A>-- with none but him most make the arrangements for a night with his wife. 
<A NAME="773"></A>So here we have this well known collusion of husband and wife: whoever 
<A NAME="774"></A>have brought a large sum to the woman are not checked by anyone and can 
<A NAME="775"></A>leave as they wish. Whoever has come with less, are caught as adulterers, 
<A NAME="776"></A>after a sign has been given; and as if they had come to school, they are 
<A NAME="777"></A>not allowed to leave before they have `written something.'
<A NAME="778"></A><BR><BR>What else should the wretch do? He has lost a considerable fortune, 
<A NAME="779"></A>though I admit that he only got that fortune unexpectedly through a fraudulent 
<A NAME="780"></A>transaction on the part of his father. The latter, having borrowed money 
<A NAME="781"></A>from a number of persons, preferred to keep their money at the cost of 
<A NAME="782"></A>his own good name. Bills poured in on every side with demands for payment. 
<A NAME="783"></A>Every one that met him laid hands on him as though he were a madman. `Steady, 
<A NAME="784"></A>now!' he says, stating that he cannot pay. So he resigned his golden rings 
<A NAME="785"></A>and all the badges of his position in society and thus came to terms with 
<A NAME="786"></A>his creditors. But he had by a most ingenious fraud transferred the greater 
<A NAME="787"></A>part of his property to his wife, and so, although he himself was needy, 
<A NAME="788"></A>ill-clad and protected by the very depth of his fall, managed to leave 
<A NAME="789"></A>this same Rufinus -- I am telling you the truth and nothing but the truth 
<A NAME="790"></A>-- no less than 3,000,000 sesterces to be squandered on riotous living. 
<A NAME="791"></A>This was the sum that came to him unencumbered from his mother's property, 
<A NAME="792"></A>over and above the daily dowry brought him by his wife. Yet all this money 
<A NAME="793"></A>has been ravenously devoured by this glutton in a few short years, all 
<A NAME="794"></A>this fortune has been destroyed by the infinite variety of his gormandizing; 
<A NAME="795"></A>so that you might really think him to be afraid of seeming in any way to 
<A NAME="796"></A>be the gainer by his father's dishonesty. This honourable fellow actually 
<A NAME="797"></A>took care that what had been ill-gained should be ill-spent, nor was anything 
<A NAME="798"></A>left him from his too ample fortune, save his depraved ambition and his 
<A NAME="799"></A>boundless appetite.
