<A NAME="10"></A><B>Part 1</B>
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="11"></A>For my part, Claudius Maximus, and you, gentlemen who sit beside him on 
<A NAME="12"></A>the bench, I regarded it as a foregone conclusion that Sicinius Aemilianus 
<A NAME="13"></A>would for sheer lack of any real ground for accusation cram his indictment 
<A NAME="14"></A>with mere vulgar abuse; for the old rascal is notorious for his unscrupulous 
<A NAME="15"></A>audacity, and, further, launched forth on his task of bringing me to trial 
<A NAME="16"></A>in your court before he had given a thought to the line his prosecution 
<A NAME="17"></A>should pursue. Now while the most innocent of men may be the victim of 
<A NAME="18"></A>false accusation, only the criminal can have his guilt brought home to 
<A NAME="19"></A>him. It is this thought that gives me special confidence, but I have further 
<A NAME="20"></A>ground for self-congratulation in the fact that I have you for my judge 
<A NAME="21"></A>on an occasion when it is my privilege to have the opportunity of clearing 
<A NAME="22"></A>philosophy of the aspersions cast upon her by the uninstructed and of proving 
<A NAME="23"></A>my own innocence. Nevertheless these false charges are on the face of them 
<A NAME="24"></A>serious enough, and the suddenness with which they have been improvised 
<A NAME="25"></A>makes them the more difficult to refute.
<A NAME="26"></A><BR><BR>For you will remember that it is only four or five days since his 
<A NAME="27"></A>advocates of malice prepense attacked me with slanderous accusations, and 
<A NAME="28"></A>began to charge me with practice of the black art and with the murder of 
<A NAME="29"></A>my step-son Pontianus. I was at the moment totally unprepared for such 
<A NAME="30"></A>a charge, and was occupied in defending an action brought by the brothers 
<A NAME="31"></A>Granius against my wife Pudentilla. I perceived that these charges were 
<A NAME="32"></A>brought forward not so much in a serious spirit as to gratify my opponents' 
<A NAME="33"></A>taste for wanton slander. I therefore straightway challenged them, not 
<A NAME="34"></A>once only, but frequently and emphatically, to proceed with their 
<A NAME="35"></A>accusation.
<A NAME="36"></A><BR><BR>The result was that Aemilianus, perceiving that you, Maximus, not 
<A NAME="37"></A>to speak of others, were strongly moved by what had occurred, and that 
<A NAME="38"></A>his words had created a serious scandal, began to be alarmed and to seek 
<A NAME="39"></A>for some safe refuge from the consequences of his rashness.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="40"></A><B>Part 2</B>

<A NAME="41"></A><BR><BR>Therefore as soon as he was compelled to set his name to the indictment, 
<A NAME="42"></A>he conveniently forgot Pontianus, his own brother's son, of whose death 
<A NAME="43"></A>he had been continually accusing me only a few days previously. He made 
<A NAME="44"></A>absolutely no mention of the death of his young kinsman; he abandoned this 
<A NAME="45"></A>most serious charge, but -- to avoid the appearance of having totally abandoned 
<A NAME="46"></A>his mendacious accusations -- he selected, as the sole support of his indictment, 
<A NAME="47"></A>the charge of magic -- a charge with which it is easy to create a prejudice 
<A NAME="48"></A>against the accused, but which it is hard to prove.
<A NAME="49"></A><BR><BR>Even that he had not the courage to do openly in his own person, 
<A NAME="50"></A>but a day later presented the indictment in the name of my step-son, Sicinius 
<A NAME="51"></A>Pudens, a mere boy, adding that he appeared as his representative. This 
<A NAME="52"></A>is a new method. He attacks me through the agency of a third person, whose 
<A NAME="53"></A>tender age he employs to shield his unworthy self against a charge of false 
<A NAME="54"></A>accusation. You, Maximus, with great acuteness saw through his designs 
<A NAME="55"></A>and ordered him to renew his original accusation in person. In spite of 
<A NAME="56"></A>his promise to comply, he cannot be induced to come to close quarters, 
<A NAME="57"></A>but actually defies your authority and continues to skirmish at long range 
<A NAME="58"></A>with his false accusations. He persistently shirks the perilous task of 
<A NAME="59"></A>a direct attack, and perseveres in his assumption of the safe role of the 
<A NAME="60"></A>accuser's legal representative. As a result, even before the case came 
<A NAME="61"></A>into court, the real nature of the accusation became obvious to the meanest 
<A NAME="62"></A>understanding. The man who invented the charge and was the first to utter 
<A NAME="63"></A>it had not the courage to take the responsibility for it. Moreover the 
<A NAME="64"></A>man in question is Sicinius Aemilianus, who, if he had discovered any true 
<A NAME="65"></A>charge against me, would scarcely have been so backward in accusing a stranger 
<A NAME="66"></A>of so many serious crimes, seeing that he falsely asserted his own uncle's 
<A NAME="67"></A>will to be a forgery although he knew it to be genuine: indeed he maintained 
<A NAME="68"></A>this assertion with such obstinate violence, that even after that distinguished 
<A NAME="69"></A>senator, Lollius Urbicus, in accordance with the decision of the distinguished 
<A NAME="70"></A>consulars, his assessors, had declared the will to be genuine and duly 
<A NAME="71"></A>proven, he continued -- such was his mad fury -- in defiance of the award 
<A NAME="72"></A>given by the voice of that most distinguished citizen, to assert with oaths 
<A NAME="73"></A>that the will was a forgery. It was only with difficulty that Lollius Urbicus 
<A NAME="74"></A>refrained from making him suffer for it.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="75"></A><B>Part 3</B>

<A NAME="76"></A><BR><BR>I rely, Maximus, on your sense of justice and on my own innocence, 
<A NAME="77"></A>but I hope that in this trial also we shall hear the voice of Lollius raised 
<A NAME="78"></A>impulsively in my defence; for Aemilianus is deliberately accusing a man 
<A NAME="79"></A>whom he knows to be innocent, a course which comes the more easy to him, 
<A NAME="80"></A>since, as I have told you, he has already been convicted of lying in a 
<A NAME="81"></A>most important case, heard before the Prefect of the city. Just as a good 
<A NAME="82"></A>man studiously avoids the repetition of a sin once committed, so men of 
<A NAME="83"></A>depraved character repeat their past offence with increased confidence, 
<A NAME="84"></A>and, I may add, the more often they do so, the more openly they display 
<A NAME="85"></A>their impudence. For honour is like a garment; the older it gets, the more 
<A NAME="86"></A>carelessly it is worn. I think it my duty, therefore, in the interest of 
<A NAME="87"></A>my own honour, to refute all my opponent's slanders before I come to the 
<A NAME="88"></A>actual indictment itself.
<A NAME="89"></A><BR><BR>For I am pleading not merely my own cause, but that of philosophy 
<A NAME="90"></A>as well, philosophy, whose grandeur is such that she resents even the slightest 
<A NAME="91"></A>slur cast upon her perfection as though it were the most serious accusation. 
<A NAME="92"></A>Knowing this, Aemilianus' advocates, only a short time ago, poured forth 
<A NAME="93"></A>with all their usual loquacity a flood of drivelling accusations, many 
<A NAME="94"></A>of which were specially invented for the purpose of blackening my character, 
<A NAME="95"></A>while the remainder were such general charges as the uninstructed are in 
<A NAME="96"></A>the habit of levelling at philosophers. It is true that we may regard these 
<A NAME="97"></A>accusations as mere interested vapourings, bought at a price and uttered 
<A NAME="98"></A>to prove their shamelessness worthy of its hire.
<A NAME="99"></A><BR><BR>It is a recognized practice on the part of professional accusers 
<A NAME="100"></A>to let out the venom of their tongues to another's hurt; nevertheless, 
<A NAME="101"></A>if only in my own interest, I must briefly refute these slanders, lest 
<A NAME="102"></A>I, whose most earnest endeavour it is to avoid incurring the slightest 
<A NAME="103"></A>spot or blemish to my fair fame, should seem, by passing over some of their 
<A NAME="104"></A>more ridiculous charges, to have tacitly admitted their truth, rather than 
<A NAME="105"></A>to have treated them with silent contempt. For a man who has any sense 
<A NAME="106"></A>of honour or self-respect must needs -- such at least is my opinion -- 
<A NAME="107"></A>feel annoyed when he is thus abused, however falsely. Even those whose 
<A NAME="108"></A>conscience reproaches them with some crime, are strongly moved to anger, 
<A NAME="109"></A>when men speak ill of them, although they have been accustomed to such 
<A NAME="110"></A>ill report ever since they became evildoers. And even though others say 
<A NAME="111"></A>naught of their crimes, they are conscious enough that such charges may 
<A NAME="112"></A>at any time deservedly be brought against them. It is therefore doubly 
<A NAME="113"></A>vexatious to the good and innocent man when charges are undeservedly brought 
<A NAME="114"></A>against him which he might with justice bring against others. For his ears 
<A NAME="115"></A>are unused and strange to ill report, and he is so accustomed to hear himself 
<A NAME="116"></A>praised that insult is more than he can bear.
<A NAME="117"></A><BR><BR>If, however, I seem to be anxious to rebut charges which are merely 
<A NAME="118"></A>frivolous and foolish, the blame must be laid at the door of those, to 
<A NAME="119"></A>whom such accusations, in spite of their triviality, can only bring disgrace. 
<A NAME="120"></A>I am not to blame. Ridiculous as these charges may be, their refutation 
<A NAME="121"></A>cannot but do me honour.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="122"></A><B>Part 4</B>

<A NAME="123"></A><BR><BR>To begin then, only a short while ago, at the commencement of the 
<A NAME="124"></A>indictment, you heard them say, `He, whom we accuse in your court, is a 
<A NAME="125"></A>philosopher of the most elegant appearance and a master of eloquence not 
<A NAME="126"></A>merely in Latin but also in Greek!' What a damning insinuation! Unless 
<A NAME="127"></A>I am mistaken, those were the very words with which Tannonius Pudens, whom 
<A NAME="128"></A>no one could accuse of being a master of eloquence, began the 
<A NAME="129"></A>indictment.
<A NAME="130"></A><BR><BR>I wish that these serious reproaches of beauty and eloquence had 
<A NAME="131"></A>been true. It would have been easy to answer in the words, with which Homer 
<A NAME="132"></A>makes Paris reply to Hector which I may interpret thus: `The most glorious 
<A NAME="133"></A>gifts of the gods are in no wise to be despised; but the things which they 
<A NAME="134"></A>are wont to give are withheld from many that would gladly possess them.' 
<A NAME="135"></A>Such would have been my reply.
<A NAME="136"></A><BR><BR>I should have added that philosophers are not forbidden to possess 
<A NAME="137"></A>a handsome face. Pythagoras, the first to take the name of `philosopher', 
<A NAME="138"></A>was the handsomest man of his day. Zeno also, the ancient philosopher of 
<A NAME="139"></A>Velia, who was the first to discover that most ingenious device of refuting 
<A NAME="140"></A>hypotheses by the method of self-inconsistency, that same Zeno was -- so 
<A NAME="141"></A>Plato asserts -- by far the most striking in appearance of all the men 
<A NAME="142"></A>of his generation. It is further recorded of many other philosophers that 
<A NAME="143"></A>they were comely of countenance and added fresh charm to their personal 
<A NAME="144"></A>beauty by their beauty of character.
<A NAME="145"></A><BR><BR>But such a defence is, as I have already said, far from me. Not 
<A NAME="146"></A>only has nature given me but a commonplace appearance, but continued literary 
<A NAME="147"></A>labour has swept away such charm as my person ever possessed, has reduced 
<A NAME="148"></A>me to a lean habit of body, sucked away all the freshness of life, destroyed 
<A NAME="149"></A>my complexion and impaired my vigour. As to my hair, which they with unblushing 
<A NAME="150"></A>mendacity declare I have allowed to grow long as an enhancement to my personal 
<A NAME="151"></A>attractions, you can judge of its elegance and beauty. As you see, it is 
<A NAME="152"></A>tangled, twisted and unkempt like a lump of tow, shaggy and irregular in 
<A NAME="153"></A>length, so knotted and matted that the tangle is past the art of man to 
<A NAME="154"></A>unravel. This is due not to mere carelessness in the tiring of my hair, 
<A NAME="155"></A>but to the fact that I never so much as comb or part it. I think this is 
<A NAME="156"></A>a sufficient refutation of the accusations concerning my hair which they 
<A NAME="157"></A>hurl against me as though it were a capital charge.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="158"></A><B>Part 5</B>

<A NAME="159"></A><BR><BR>As to my eloquence -- if only eloquence were mine -- it would be 
<A NAME="160"></A>small matter either for wonder or envy if I, who from my earliest years 
<A NAME="161"></A>to the present moment have devoted myself with all my powers to the sole 
<A NAME="162"></A>study of literature and for this spurned all other pleasures, had sought 
<A NAME="163"></A>to win eloquence to be mine with toil such as few or none have ever expended, 
<A NAME="164"></A>ceasing neither night nor day, to the neglect and impairment of my bodily 
<A NAME="165"></A>health. But my opponents need fear nothing from my eloquence. If I have 
<A NAME="166"></A>made any real advance therein, it is my aspirations rather than my attainments 
<A NAME="167"></A>on which I must base my claim.
<A NAME="168"></A><BR><BR>Certainly if the aphorism said to occur in the poems of Statius 
<A NAME="169"></A>Caecilius be true, that innocence is eloquence itself, to that extent I 
<A NAME="170"></A>may lay claim to eloquence and boast that I yield to none. For on that 
<A NAME="171"></A>assumption what living man could be more eloquent than myself? I have never 
<A NAME="172"></A>even harboured in my thoughts anything to which I should fear to give utterance. 
<A NAME="173"></A>Nay, my eloquence is consummate, for I have ever held all sin in abomination; 
<A NAME="174"></A>I have the highest oratory at my command, for I have uttered no word, I 
<A NAME="175"></A>have done no deed, of which I need fear to discourse in public. I will 
<A NAME="176"></A>begin therefore to discourse of those verses of mine, which they have produced 
<A NAME="177"></A>as though they were something of which I ought to be ashamed. You must 
<A NAME="178"></A>have noticed the laughter with which I showed my annoyance at the absurd 
<A NAME="179"></A>and illiterate manner in which they recited them.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="180"></A><B>Part 6</B>

<A NAME="181"></A><BR><BR>They began by reading one of my jeux d'esprit, a brief letter in 
<A NAME="182"></A>verse, addressed to a certain Calpurnianus on the subject of a tooth-powder. 
<A NAME="183"></A>When Calpurnianus produced my letter as evidence against me, his desire 
<A NAME="184"></A>to do me a hurt blinded him to the fact that if anything in the letter 
<A NAME="185"></A>could be urged as a reproach against me, he shared in that reproach. For 
<A NAME="186"></A>the verses testify to the fact that he had asked me to send him the wherewithal 
<A NAME="187"></A>to clean his teeth:
<A NAME="188"></A><BR><BR>Good morrow! Friend Calpurnianus, take
<A NAME="189"></A><BR>the salutation these swift verses make.
<A NAME="190"></A><BR>Wherewith I send, responsive to thy call,
<A NAME="191"></A><BR>a powder rare to cleans thy teeth withal.
<A NAME="192"></A><BR>This delicate dust of Arab spices fine,
<A NAME="193"></A><BR>shall smooth the swollen gums and sweep away
<A NAME="194"></A><BR>the relics of the feast of yesterday.
<A NAME="195"></A><BR>So shall no foulness, no dark smirch be seen,
<A NAME="196"></A><BR>if laughter shown thy teeth their lips between.
<A NAME="197"></A><BR><BR>I ask you, what is there in these verses that is disgusting in 
<A NAME="198"></A>point either of matter or of manner? What is there that a philosopher should 
<A NAME="199"></A>be ashamed to own? Unless indeed I am to blame for sending a powder made 
<A NAME="200"></A>of Arabian spices to Calpurnianus, for whom it would be more suitable that 
<A NAME="201"></A>he should
<A NAME="202"></A><BR><BR>Polish his teeth and ruddy gums,
<A NAME="203"></A><BR><BR>as Catullus says, after the filthy fashion in vogue among the 
<A NAME="204"></A>Iberians.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="205"></A><B>Part 7</B>

<A NAME="206"></A><BR><BR>I saw a short while back that some of you could scarcely restrain 
<A NAME="207"></A>your laughter, when our orator treated these views of mine on the cleansing 
<A NAME="208"></A>of the teeth as a matter for savage denunciation, and condemned my administration 
<A NAME="209"></A>of a tooth-powder with fiercer indignation than has ever been shown in 
<A NAME="210"></A>condemning the administration of a poison.
<A NAME="211"></A><BR><BR>Of course it is a serious charge, and one that no philosopher can 
<A NAME="212"></A>afford to despise, to say of a man that he will not allow a speck of dirt 
<A NAME="213"></A>to be seen upon his person, that he will not allow any visible portion 
<A NAME="214"></A>of his body to be offensive or unclean, least of all the mouth, the organ 
<A NAME="215"></A>used most frequently, openly and conspicuously by man, whether to kiss 
<A NAME="216"></A>a friend, to conduct a conversation, to speak in public, or to offer up 
<A NAME="217"></A>prayer in some temple. Indeed speech is the prelude to every kind of action 
<A NAME="218"></A>and, as the greatest of poets says, proceeds from `the barrier of our teeth'. 
<A NAME="219"></A>If there were any one present here today with like command of the grand 
<A NAME="220"></A>style, he might say after his fashion that those above all men who have 
<A NAME="221"></A>any care for their manner of speaking, should pay closer attention to their 
<A NAME="222"></A>mouth than to any other portion of their body, for it is the soul's antechamber, 
<A NAME="223"></A>the portal of speech, and the gathering place where thoughts assemble. 
<A NAME="224"></A>I myself should say that in my poor judgement there is nothing less seemly 
<A NAME="225"></A>for a freeborn man with the education of a gentleman than an unwashen mouth. 
<A NAME="226"></A>For man's mouth is in position exalted, to the eye conspicuous, in use 
<A NAME="227"></A>eloquent. True, in wild beasts and cattle the mouth is placed low and looks 
<A NAME="228"></A>downward to the feet, is in close proximity to their food and to the path 
<A NAME="229"></A>thq tread, and is hardly ever conspicuous save when its owner is dead or 
<A NAME="230"></A>infuriated with a desire to bite. But there is no part of man that sooner 
<A NAME="231"></A>catches the eye when he is silent, or more often when he 
<A NAME="232"></A>speaks.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="233"></A><B>Part 8</B>

<A NAME="234"></A><BR><BR>I should be obliged, therefore, if my critic Aemilianus would answer 
<A NAME="235"></A>me and tell me whether he is ever in the habit of washing his feet, or, 
<A NAME="236"></A>if he admits that he is in the habit of so doing, whether he is prepared 
<A NAME="237"></A>to argue that a man should pay more attention to the cleanliness of his 
<A NAME="238"></A>feet than to that of his teeth. Certainly, if like you, Aemilianus, he 
<A NAME="239"></A>never opens his mouth save to utter slander and abuse, I should advise 
<A NAME="240"></A>him to pay no attention to the state of his mouth nor to attempt to remove 
<A NAME="241"></A>the stains from his teeth with oriental powders: he would be better employed 
<A NAME="242"></A>in rubbing them with charcoal from some funeral pyre. Least of all should 
<A NAME="243"></A>he wash them with common water; rather let his guilty tongue, the chosen 
<A NAME="244"></A>servant of lies and bitter words, rot in the filth and ordure that it loves! 
<A NAME="245"></A>Is it reasonable, wretch, that your tongue should be fresh and clean, when 
<A NAME="246"></A>your voice is foul and loathsome, or that, like the viper, you should employ 
<A NAME="247"></A>snow-white teeth for the emission of dark, deadly poison? On the other 
<A NAME="248"></A>hand it is only right that, just as we wash a vessel that is to hold good 
<A NAME="249"></A>liquor, he who knows that his words will be at once useful and agreeable 
<A NAME="250"></A>should cleanse his mouth as a prelude to speech.
<A NAME="251"></A><BR><BR>But why should I speak further of man? Even the crocodile, the 
<A NAME="252"></A>monster of the Nile -- so they tell me -- opens his jaws in all innocence, 
<A NAME="253"></A>that his teeth may be cleaned. For his mouth being large, tongueless, and 
<A NAME="254"></A>continually open in the water, multitudes of leeches become entangled in 
<A NAME="255"></A>his teeth: these, when the crocodile emerges from the river and opens his 
<A NAME="256"></A>mouth, are removed by a friendly waterbird, which is allowed to insert 
<A NAME="257"></A>its beak without any risk to itself.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="258"></A><B>Part 9</B>

<A NAME="259"></A><BR><BR>But enough of this! I now come to certain other of my verses, which 
<A NAME="260"></A>according to them are amatory; but so vilely and coarsely did they read 
<A NAME="261"></A>them as to leave no impression save one of disgust. Now what has it to 
<A NAME="262"></A>do with the malpractices of the black art, if I write poems in praise of 
<A NAME="263"></A>the boys of my friend Scribonius Laetus? Does the mere fact of my being 
<A NAME="264"></A>a poet make me a wizard? Who ever heard any orator produce such likely 
<A NAME="265"></A>ground for suspicion, such apt conjectures, such close-reasoned argument? 
<A NAME="266"></A>`Apuleius has written verses!' If they are bad, that is something against 
<A NAME="267"></A>him as a poet, but not as a philosopher. If they are good, why do you accuse 
<A NAME="268"></A>him? `But they were frivolous verses of an erotic character.' So that is 
<A NAME="269"></A>the charge you bring against me? and it was a mere slip of the tongue when 
<A NAME="270"></A>you indicted me for practising the black art?
<A NAME="271"></A><BR><BR>And yet many others have written such verse, although you may be 
<A NAME="272"></A>ignorant of the fact. Among the Greeks, for instance, there was a certain 
<A NAME="273"></A>Teian, there was a Lacedaemonian, a Cean, and countless others; there was 
<A NAME="274"></A>even a woman, a Lesbian, who wrote with such grace and such passion that 
<A NAME="275"></A>the sweetness of her song makes us forgive the impropriety of her words; 
<A NAME="276"></A>among our own poets there were Aedituus, Porcius, and Catulus, with countless 
<A NAME="277"></A>others. `But they were not philosophers.' Will you then deny that Solon 
<A NAME="278"></A>was a serious man and a philosopher? Yet he is the author of that most 
<A NAME="279"></A>wanton verse:
<A NAME="280"></A><BR><BR>Longing for your thighs and your sweet mouth.
<A NAME="281"></A><BR><BR>What is there so lascivious in all my verses compared with that 
<A NAME="282"></A>one line? I will say nothing of the writings of Diogenes the Cynic, of 
<A NAME="283"></A>Zeno the founder of Stoicism, and many other similar instances. Let me 
<A NAME="284"></A>recite my own verses afresh, that my opponents may realize that I am not 
<A NAME="285"></A>ashamed of them:
<A NAME="286"></A><BR><BR>Critias my treasure is and you,
<A NAME="287"></A><BR>light of my life, Charinus, too
<A NAME="288"></A><BR>hold in my love-tormented heart
<A NAME="289"></A><BR>your own inalienable part.
<A NAME="290"></A><BR>Ah! Doubt not! With redoubled spite
<A NAME="291"></A><BR>though fire on fire consume me quite,
<A NAME="292"></A><BR>the flames ye kindle, boys divine,
<A NAME="293"></A><BR>I can endure, so ye be mine.
<A NAME="294"></A><BR>Only to each may I be dear
<A NAME="295"></A><BR>as your own selves are, and as near;
<A NAME="296"></A><BR>grant only this and you shall be
<A NAME="297"></A><BR>dear as mine own two eyes to be.
<A NAME="298"></A><BR><BR>Now let me read you the others also which they read last as being 
<A NAME="299"></A>the most intemperate in expression.
<A NAME="300"></A><BR><BR>I lay these garlands, Critias sweet,
<A NAME="301"></A><BR>and this my song before thy feet;
<A NAME="302"></A><BR>song to thyself I dedicate,
<A NAME="303"></A><BR>wreaths to the Angel of thy fate.
<A NAME="304"></A><BR>The song I send to hymn the praise
<A NAME="305"></A><BR>of this, the best of all glad days,
<A NAME="306"></A><BR>whereon the circling seasons bring
<A NAME="307"></A><BR>the glory of thy fourteenth spring;
<A NAME="308"></A><BR>the garlands, that thy brows may shine
<A NAME="309"></A><BR>with splendour worthy spring's and thine,
<A NAME="310"></A><BR>that thou in boyhood's golden hours
<A NAME="311"></A><BR>mayst deck the flower of life with flowers.
<A NAME="312"></A><BR>Wherefore for these bright blooms of spring
<A NAME="313"></A><BR>thy springtide sweet surrendering,
<A NAME="314"></A><BR>the tribute of my love repay
<A NAME="315"></A><BR>and all my gifts with thine outweigh.
<A NAME="316"></A><BR>Surpass the twined garland's grace
<A NAME="317"></A><BR>with arms entwined in soft embrace;
<A NAME="318"></A><BR>the crimson of the rose eclipse
<A NAME="319"></A><BR>with kisses from thy rosy lips.
<A NAME="320"></A><BR>Or if thou wilt, be this my meed
<A NAME="321"></A><BR>and breathe thy soul into the reed; \u00a1!
<A NAME="322"></A><BR>then shall my songs be shamed and mute
<A NAME="323"></A><BR>before the music of thy flute.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="324"></A><B>Part 10</B>

<A NAME="325"></A><BR><BR>This, Maximus, is what they throw in my teeth, as though it were 
<A NAME="326"></A>the work of an infamous rake: verses about garlands and 
<A NAME="327"></A>serenades.
<A NAME="328"></A><BR><BR>You must have noticed also that in this connexion they further 
<A NAME="329"></A>attack me for calling these boys Charinus and Critias, which are not their 
<A NAME="330"></A>true names. On this principle they may as well accuse Caius Catullus for 
<A NAME="331"></A>calling Clodia Lesbia, Ticidas for substituting the name Perilla for that 
<A NAME="332"></A>of Metella, Propertius for concealing the name Hostia beneath the pseudonym 
<A NAME="333"></A>of Cynthia, and Tibullus for singing of Delia in his verse, when it was 
<A NAME="334"></A>Plania who ruled his heart. For my part I should rather blame Caius Lucilius, 
<A NAME="335"></A>even allowing him all the license of a satiric poet, for prostituting to 
<A NAME="336"></A>the public gaze the boys Gentius and Macedo, whose real names he mentions 
<A NAME="337"></A>in his verse without any attempt at concealment. How much more reserved 
<A NAME="338"></A>is Mantua's poet, who, when like myself he praised the slave-boy of his 
<A NAME="339"></A>friend Pollio in one of his light pastoral poems, shrinks from mentioning 
<A NAME="340"></A>real nnames and calls himself Corydon and the boy Alexis.
<A NAME="341"></A><BR><BR>But Aemilianus, whose rusticity far surpasses that of the Virgilean 
<A NAME="342"></A>shepherds and cowherds, who is, in fact, and always has been a boor and 
<A NAME="343"></A>a barbarian, though he thinks himself far more austere than Serranus, Curius, 
<A NAME="344"></A>or Fabricius, those heroes of the days of old, denies that such verses 
<A NAME="345"></A>are worthy of a philosopher who is a follower of Plato. Will you persist 
<A NAME="346"></A>in this attitude, Aemilianus, if I can show that my verses were modelled 
<A NAME="347"></A>upon Plato? For the only verses of Plato now extant are love-elegies, the 
<A NAME="348"></A>reason, I imagine, being that he burned all his other poems because they 
<A NAME="349"></A>were inferior in charm and finish. Learn then the verses written by Plato 
<A NAME="350"></A>in honour of the boy Aster, though I doubt if at your age it is possible 
<A NAME="351"></A>for you to become a man of learning.
<A NAME="352"></A><BR><BR>Thou wert the morning star among the living
<A NAME="353"></A><BR>ere thy fair light had fled; --
<A NAME="354"></A><BR>now having died, thou art as Hesperus giving
<A NAME="355"></A><BR>new light unto the dead.
<A NAME="356"></A><BR><BR>There is another poem by Plato dealing conjointly with the boys 
<A NAME="357"></A>Alexis and Phaedrus:
<A NAME="358"></A><BR><BR>I lid but breathe the words `Alexis fair',
<A NAME="359"></A><BR>and all men gazed on him with wondering eyes,
<A NAME="360"></A><BR>my soul, why point to questing beasts their prize?
<A NAME="361"></A><BR>'Twas thus we lost our Phaedrus; ah! Beware!
<A NAME="362"></A><BR><BR>Without citing any further examples I will conclude by quoting 
<A NAME="363"></A>a line addressed by Plato to Dion of Syracuse:
<A NAME="364"></A><BR><BR>Dion, with love thou hast distraught my soul.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="365"></A><B>Part 11</B>

<A NAME="366"></A><BR><BR>Which of us is most to blame? I who am fool enough to speak seriously 
<A NAME="367"></A>of such things in a lawcourt? Or you who are slanderous enough to include 
<A NAME="368"></A>such charges in your indictment? For sportive effusions in verse are valueless 
<A NAME="369"></A>as evidence of a poet's morals. Have you not read Catullus, who replies 
<A NAME="370"></A>thus to those who wish him ill:
<A NAME="371"></A><BR><BR>A virtuous poet must be chaste. Agreed.
<A NAME="372"></A><BR>But for his verses there is no such need.
<A NAME="373"></A><BR><BR>The divine Hadrian, when he honoured the tomb of his friend the 
<A NAME="374"></A>poet Voconius with an inscription in verse from his own pen, wrote 
<A NAME="375"></A>thus:
<A NAME="376"></A><BR><BR>Thy verse was wanton, but thy soul was chaste,
<A NAME="377"></A><BR><BR>words which he would never have written had he regarded verse of 
<A NAME="378"></A>somewhat too lively a wit as proving their author to be a man of immoral 
<A NAME="379"></A>life. I remember that I have read not a few poems by the divine Hadrian 
<A NAME="380"></A>himself which were of the same type. Come now, Aemilianus, I dare you to 
<A NAME="381"></A>say that that was ill done which was done by an emperor and censor, the 
<A NAME="382"></A>divine Hadrian, and once done was recorded for subsequent 
<A NAME="383"></A>generations.
<A NAME="384"></A><BR><BR>But, apart from that, do you imagine that Maximus will censure 
<A NAME="385"></A>anything that has Plato for its model, Plato whose verses, which I have 
<A NAME="386"></A>just read, are all the purer for being frank, all the more modest for being 
<A NAME="387"></A>outspoken? For in these matters and the like, dissimulation and concealment 
<A NAME="388"></A>is the mark of the sinner, open acknowledgement and publication a sign 
<A NAME="389"></A>that the writer is but exercising his wit. For nature has bestowed on innocence 
<A NAME="390"></A>a voice wherewith to speak, but to guilt she has given silence to veil 
<A NAME="391"></A>its sin.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="392"></A><B>Part 12</B>

<A NAME="393"></A><BR><BR>I say nothing of those lofty and divine Platonic doctrina, that 
<A NAME="394"></A>are familiar to but few of the elect and wholly unknown to all the uninitiate, 
<A NAME="395"></A>such for instance as that which teaches us that Venus is not one goddess, 
<A NAME="396"></A>but two, each being strong in her own type of love and several types of 
<A NAME="397"></A>lovers. The one is the goddess of the common herd, who is fired by base 
<A NAME="398"></A>and vulgar passion and commands not only the hearts of men, but cattle 
<A NAME="399"></A>and wild beasts also, to give themselves over to the gratification of their 
<A NAME="400"></A>desires: she strikes down these creatures with fierce intolerable force 
<A NAME="401"></A>and fetters their servile bodies in the embraces of lust. The other is 
<A NAME="402"></A>a celestial power endued with lofty and generous passion: she cares for 
<A NAME="403"></A>none save men, and of them but few; she neither stings nor lures her followers 
<A NAME="404"></A>to foul deeds. Her love is neither wanton nor voluptuous, but serious and 
<A NAME="405"></A>unadorned, and wins her lovers to the pursuit of virtue by revealing to 
<A NAME="406"></A>them how fair a thing is nobility of soul. Or, if ever she commends beautiful 
<A NAME="407"></A>bodies to their admiration, she puts a bar upon all indecorous conduct. 
<A NAME="408"></A>For the only claim that physical beauty has upon the admiration is that 
<A NAME="409"></A>it reminds those whose souls have soared above things human to things divine, 
<A NAME="410"></A>of that beauty which once they beheld in all its truth and purity enthroned 
<A NAME="411"></A>among the gods in heaven. Wherefore let us admit that Afranius shows his 
<A NAME="412"></A>usual beauty of expression when he says: `Only the sage can love, only 
<A NAME="413"></A>desire is known to others'; although if you would know the real truth, 
<A NAME="414"></A>Aemilianus, or if you are capable of ever comprehending such high matters, 
<A NAME="415"></A>the sage does not love, but only remembers.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="416"></A><B>Part 13</B>

<A NAME="417"></A><BR><BR>I would therefore beg you to pardon the philosopher Plato for his 
<A NAME="418"></A>amatory verse, and relieve me of the necessity of offending against the 
<A NAME="419"></A>precepts put by Ennius into the mouth of Neoptolemus by philosophizing 
<A NAME="420"></A>at undue length; on the other hand if you refuse to pardon Plato, I am 
<A NAME="421"></A>quite ready to suffer blame on this count in his company.
<A NAME="422"></A><BR><BR>I must express my deep gratitude to you, Maximus, for listening 
<A NAME="423"></A>with such close attention to these side issues, which are necessary to 
<A NAME="424"></A>my defence inasmuch as I am paying back my accusers in their own coin. 
<A NAME="425"></A>Your kindness emboldens me to make this further request, that you will 
<A NAME="426"></A>listen to all that I have to say by way of prelude to my answer to the 
<A NAME="427"></A>main charge with the same courtesy and attention that you have hitherto 
<A NAME="428"></A>shown.
<A NAME="429"></A><BR><BR>For next I have to deal with that long oration, austere as any 
<A NAME="430"></A>censor's, which Pudens delivered on the subject of my mirror. He nearly 
<A NAME="431"></A>exploded, so violently did he declaim against the horrid nature of my offence. 
<A NAME="432"></A>`The philosopher owns a mirror, the philosopher actually possesses a mirror.' 
<A NAME="433"></A>Grant that I possess it: if I denied it, you might really think that your 
<A NAME="434"></A>accusation had gone home: still it is by no means a necessary inference 
<A NAME="435"></A>that I am in the habit of adorning myself before a mirror. Why! suppose 
<A NAME="436"></A>I possessed a theatrical wardrobe, would you venture to argue from that 
<A NAME="437"></A>that I am in the frequent habit of wearing the trailing robes of tragedy, 
<A NAME="438"></A>the saffron cloak of the mimic dance, or the patchwork suit of the harlequinade? 
<A NAME="439"></A>I think not. On the contrary there are plenty of things of which I enjoy 
<A NAME="440"></A>the use without the possession.
<A NAME="441"></A><BR><BR>But if possession is no proof of use nor non-possession of non-use, 
<A NAME="442"></A>and if you complain of the fact that I look into the mirror rather than 
<A NAME="443"></A>that I possess it, you must go on to show when and in whose presence I 
<A NAME="444"></A>have ever looked into it; for as things stand, you make it a greater crime 
<A NAME="445"></A>for a philosopher to look upon a mirror than for the uninitiated to gaze 
<A NAME="446"></A>upon the mystic emblems of Ceres.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="447"></A><B>Part 14</B>

<A NAME="448"></A><BR><BR>Come now, let me admit that I h\u00e1ve looked into it. Is it a crime 
<A NAME="449"></A>to be acquainted with one's own likeness and to carry it with one wherever 
<A NAME="450"></A>one goes ready to hand within the compass of a small mirror, instead of 
<A NAME="451"></A>keeping it hidden away in some one place? Are you ignorant of the fact 
<A NAME="452"></A>that there is nothing more pleasing for a man to look upon than his own 
<A NAME="453"></A>image? At any rate I know that fathers love those sons most who most resemble 
<A NAME="454"></A>themselves, and that public statues are decreed as a reward for merit that 
<A NAME="455"></A>the original may gladden his heart by looking on them. What else is the 
<A NAME="456"></A>significance of statues and portraits produced by the various arts? You 
<A NAME="457"></A>will scarcely maintain the paradox that what is worthy of admiration when 
<A NAME="458"></A>produced by art is blameworthy when produced by nature; for nature has 
<A NAME="459"></A>an even greater facility and truth than art.
<A NAME="460"></A><BR><BR>Long labour is expended over all the portraits wrought by the hand 
<A NAME="461"></A>of man, yet they never attain to such truth as is revealed by a mirror. 
<A NAME="462"></A>Clay is lacking in life, marble in colour, painting in solidity, and all 
<A NAME="463"></A>three in motion, which is the most convincing element in a likeness: whereas 
<A NAME="464"></A>in a mirror the reflection of the image is marvellous, for it is not only 
<A NAME="465"></A>like its original, but moves and follows every nod of the man to whom it 
<A NAME="466"></A>belongs; its age always corresponds to that of those who look into the 
<A NAME="467"></A>mirror, from their earliest childhood to their expiring age: it puts on 
<A NAME="468"></A>all the changes brought by the advance of years, shares all the varying 
<A NAME="469"></A>habits of the body, and imitates the shifting expressions of joy and sorrow 
<A NAME="470"></A>that may be seen on the face of one and the same man. For all we mould 
<A NAME="471"></A>in clay or cast in bronze or carve in stone or tint with encaustic pigments 
<A NAME="472"></A>or colour with paint, in a word, every attempt at artistic representation 
<A NAME="473"></A>by the hand of man after a brief lapse of time loses in truth and becomes 
<A NAME="474"></A>motionless and impassive like the face of a corpse. So far superior to 
<A NAME="475"></A>all pictorial art in respect of truthful representation is that craftsmanly 
<A NAME="476"></A>smoothness and productive splendour of the mirror.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="477"></A><B>Part 15</B>

<A NAME="478"></A><BR><BR>Two alternatives then are before us. We must either follow the 
<A NAME="479"></A>precept of the Lacedaemonian Agesilaus, who had no confidence in his personal 
<A NAME="480"></A>appeannce and refused to allow his portrait to be painted or carved; or 
<A NAME="481"></A>we must accept the universal custom of the rest of mankind which welcomes 
<A NAME="482"></A>portraiture both in sculpture and painting. In the latter case, is there 
<A NAME="483"></A>any reason for preferring to see one's portrait moulded in marble rather 
<A NAME="484"></A>than reflected in silver, in a painting rather than in a 
<A NAME="485"></A>mirror?
<A NAME="486"></A><BR><BR>Or do you regard it as disgraceful to pay continual attention to 
<A NAME="487"></A>one's own appearance? Is not Socrates said actually to have urged his followers 
<A NAME="488"></A>frequently to consider their image in a glass, that so those of them that 
<A NAME="489"></A>prided themselves on their appearance might above all else take care that 
<A NAME="490"></A>they did no dishonour to the splendour of their body by the blackness of 
<A NAME="491"></A>their hearts; while those who regarded themselves as less than handsome 
<A NAME="492"></A>in personal appearance might take especial pains to conceal the meanness 
<A NAME="493"></A>of their body by the glory of their virtue? You see; the wisest man of 
<A NAME="494"></A>his day actually went so far as to use the mirror as an instrument of moral 
<A NAME="495"></A>discipline. Again, who is ignorant of the fact that Demosthenes, the greatest 
<A NAME="496"></A>master of the art of speaking, always practised pleading before a mirror 
<A NAME="497"></A>as though before a professor of rhetoric? When that supreme orator had 
<A NAME="498"></A>drained deep draughts of eloquence in the study of Plato the philosopher, 
<A NAME="499"></A>and had learned all that could be learned of argumentation from the dialectician 
<A NAME="500"></A>Eubulides, last of all he betook himself to a mirror to learn perfection 
<A NAME="501"></A>of delivery. Which do you think should pay greatest attention to the decorousness 
<A NAME="502"></A>of his appearance in the delivery of a speech? The orator when he wrangles 
<A NAME="503"></A>with his opponent or the philosopher when he rebukes the vices of mankind? 
<A NAME="504"></A>The man who harangues for a brief space before an audience of jurymen drawn 
<A NAME="505"></A>by the chance of the lot, or he who is continually discoursing with all 
<A NAME="506"></A>mankind for audience? The man who is quarrelling over the boundaries of 
<A NAME="507"></A>lands, or he whose theme is the boundaries of good and 
<A NAME="508"></A>evil?
<A NAME="509"></A><BR><BR>Moreover there are other reasons why a philosopher should look 
<A NAME="510"></A>into a mirror. He is not always concerned with the contemplation of his 
<A NAME="511"></A>own likeness, he contemplates also the causes which produce that likeness. 
<A NAME="512"></A>Is Epicurus right when he asserts that images proceed forth from us, as 
<A NAME="513"></A>it were a kind of slough that continually streams from our bodies? These 
<A NAME="514"></A>images when they strike anything smooth and solid are reflected by the 
<A NAME="515"></A>shock and reversed in such wise as to give back an image turned to face 
<A NAME="516"></A>its original. Or should we accept the view maintained by other philosophers 
<A NAME="517"></A>that rays are emitted from our body? According to Plato these rays are 
<A NAME="518"></A>filtered forth from the centre of our eyes and mingle and blend with the 
<A NAME="519"></A>light of the world without us; according to Archytas they issue forth from 
<A NAME="520"></A>us without any external support; according to the Stoics these rays are 
<A NAME="521"></A>called into action by the tension of the air: all agree that, when these 
<A NAME="522"></A>emanations strike any dense, smooth, and shining surface, they return to 
<A NAME="523"></A>the surface from which they proceeded in such manner that the angle of 
<A NAME="524"></A>incidence is equal to the angle of reflection, and as a result that which 
<A NAME="525"></A>they approach and touch without the mirror is imaged within the 
<A NAME="526"></A>mirror.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="527"></A><B>Part 16</B>

<A NAME="528"></A><BR><BR>What do you think? Should not philosophers make all these problems 
<A NAME="529"></A>subjects of research and inquiry and in solitary study look into mirrors 
<A NAME="530"></A>of every kind, liquid and solid? There is also over and above these questions 
<A NAME="531"></A>further matter for discussion. For instance, why is it that in flat mirrors 
<A NAME="532"></A>all images and objects reflected are shown in almost precisely their original 
<A NAME="533"></A>dimensions, whereas in convex and spherical mirrors everything is seen 
<A NAME="534"></A>smaller, in concave mirrors on the other hand larger than nature? Why again 
<A NAME="535"></A>and under what circumstances are left and right reversed? When does one 
<A NAME="536"></A>and the same mirror seem now to withdraw the image into its depths, now 
<A NAME="537"></A>to extrude it forth to view? Why do concave mirrors when held at right 
<A NAME="538"></A>angles to the rays of the sun kindle tinder set opposite them? What is 
<A NAME="539"></A>the cause of the prismatic colours of the rainbow, or of the appearance 
<A NAME="540"></A>in heaven of two rival images of the sun, with sundry other phenomena treated 
<A NAME="541"></A>in a monumental volume by Archimedes of Syracuse, a man who showed extraordinary 
<A NAME="542"></A>and unique subtlety in all branches of geometry, but was perhaps particularly 
<A NAME="543"></A>remarkable for his frequent and attentive inspection of 
<A NAME="544"></A>mirrors.
<A NAME="545"></A><BR><BR>If you had only read this book, Aemilianus, and, instead of devoting 
<A NAME="546"></A>yourself to the study of your fields and their dull clods, had studied 
<A NAME="547"></A>the mathematician's slate and blackboard, believe me, although your face 
<A NAME="548"></A>is hideous enough for a tragic mask of Thyestes, you would assuredly, in 
<A NAME="549"></A>your desire for the acquisition of knowledge, look into the glass and sometimes 
<A NAME="550"></A>leave your plough to marvel at the numberless furrows with which wrinkles 
<A NAME="551"></A>have scored your face.
<A NAME="552"></A><BR><BR>But I should not be surprised if you prefer me to speak of your 
<A NAME="553"></A>ugly deformity of a face and to be silent about your morals, which are 
<A NAME="554"></A>infinitely more repulsive than your features. I will say nothing of them. 
<A NAME="555"></A>In the first place I am not naturally of a quarrelsome disposition, and 
<A NAME="556"></A>secondly I am glad to say that until quite recently you might have been 
<A NAME="557"></A>white or black for all I knew. Even now my knowledge of you is inadequate. 
<A NAME="558"></A>The reason for this is that your rustic occupations have kept you in obscurity, 
<A NAME="559"></A>while I have been occupied by my studies, and so the shadow cast about 
<A NAME="560"></A>you by your insignificance has shielded your character from scrutiny, while 
<A NAME="561"></A>I for my part take no interest in others' ill deeds, but have always thought 
<A NAME="562"></A>it more important to conceal my own faults than to track out those of others. 
<A NAME="563"></A>As a result you have the advantage of one who, while he is himself shrouded 
<A NAME="564"></A>in darkness, surveys another who chances to have taken his stand in the 
<A NAME="565"></A>full light of day. You from your darkness can with ease form an opinion 
<A NAME="566"></A>as to what I am doing in my not undistinguished position before all the 
<A NAME="567"></A>world; but your position is so abject, so obscure, and so withdrawn from 
<A NAME="568"></A>the light of publicity that you are by no means so conspicuous.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="569"></A><B>Part 17</B>

<A NAME="570"></A><BR><BR>I neither know nor care to know whether you have slaves to till 
<A NAME="571"></A>your fields or whether you do so by interchange of service with your neighbours. 
<A NAME="572"></A>But you know that at Oea I gave three slaves their freedom on the same 
<A NAME="573"></A>day, and your advocate has cast it in my teeth together with other actions 
<A NAME="574"></A>of mine of which you have given him information. And yet but a few minutes 
<A NAME="575"></A>earlier he had declared that I came to Oea accompanied by no more than 
<A NAME="576"></A>one slave. I challenge you to tell me how I could have made one slave into 
<A NAME="577"></A>three free men. But perhaps this is one of my feats of magic. Has lying 
<A NAME="578"></A>made you blind, or shall I rather say that from force of habit you are 
<A NAME="579"></A>incapable of speaking the truth? `Apuleius,' you say, `came to Oea with 
<A NAME="580"></A>one slave,' and then only a very few words later you blurt out, `Apuleius 
<A NAME="581"></A>on one and the same day at Oea gave three slaves their freedom.' Not even 
<A NAME="582"></A>the assertion that I had come with three slaves and had given them all 
<A NAME="583"></A>their freedom would have been credible: but suppose I had done so, what 
<A NAME="584"></A>reason do you have for regarding three slaves as a mark of my poverty, 
<A NAME="585"></A>rather than for considering three freed men as a proof of my 
<A NAME="586"></A>wealth?
<A NAME="587"></A><BR><BR>You don't know, really, Aemilianus, you don't know how to accuse 
<A NAME="588"></A>a philosopher: you reproach me for the scantiness of my household, whereas 
<A NAME="589"></A>it would really have been my duty to have laid claim, however falsely, 
<A NAME="590"></A>to such poverty. It would have redounded to my credit, for I know that 
<A NAME="591"></A>not only philosophers of whom I boast myself a follower, but also generals 
<A NAME="592"></A>of the Roman people have gloried in the small number of their slaves. Have 
<A NAME="593"></A>your advocates really never read that Marcus Antonius, a man who had filled 
<A NAME="594"></A>the office of consul, had but eight slaves in his house? That that very 
<A NAME="595"></A>Carbo who obtained supreme control of Rome had fewer by one? That Manius 
<A NAME="596"></A>Curius, famous beyond all men for the crowns of victory that he had won, 
<A NAME="597"></A>Manius Curius who thrice led the triumphal procession through the same 
<A NAME="598"></A>gate of Rome, had but two servants to attend him in camp, so that in good 
<A NAME="599"></A>truth that same man who triumphed over the Sabines, the Samnites, and Pyrrhus 
<A NAME="600"></A>had fewer slaves than triumphs? Marcus Cato did not wait for others to 
<A NAME="601"></A>tell it of him, but himself records the fact in one of his speeches that 
<A NAME="602"></A>when he set out as consul for Spain he took but three slaves from the city 
<A NAME="603"></A>with him. When, however, he came to stay at a state residence, the number 
<A NAME="604"></A>seemed insufficient, and he ordered two slaves to be bought in the market 
<A NAME="605"></A>to wait on him at table, so that he took five in all to 
<A NAME="606"></A>Spain.
<A NAME="607"></A><BR><BR>Had Pudens come across these facts in his reading, he would, I 
<A NAME="608"></A>think, either have omitted this particular slander or would have preferred 
<A NAME="609"></A>to reproach me on the ground that three slaves were too large rather than 
<A NAME="610"></A>too small an establishment for a philosopher.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="611"></A><B>Part 18</B>

<A NAME="612"></A><BR><BR>Pudens actually reproached me with being poor, a charge which is 
<A NAME="613"></A>welcome to a philosopher and one that he may glory in. For poverty has 
<A NAME="614"></A>long been the handmaid of philosophy; frugal and sober, she is content 
<A NAME="615"></A>with little, greedy for naught save honour, a stable possession in the 
<A NAME="616"></A>face of wealth, her mien is free from care, and her adornment simple; her 
<A NAME="617"></A>counsels are beneficent, she puffs no man up with pride, she corrupts no 
<A NAME="618"></A>man with passions beyond his control, she maddens no man with the lust 
<A NAME="619"></A>for power, she neither desires nor can indulge in the pleasures of feasting 
<A NAME="620"></A>and of sex. These sins and their like are usually the nurslings of wealth. 
<A NAME="621"></A>Count over all the greatest crimes recorded in the history of mankind, 
<A NAME="622"></A>you will find no poor man among their guilty authors. On the other hand, 
<A NAME="623"></A>it is rare to find wealthy men among the great figures of history. All 
<A NAME="624"></A>those at whom we marvel for their great deeds were the nurslings of poverty 
<A NAME="625"></A>from their very cradles, poverty that founded all cities in the days of 
<A NAME="626"></A>old, poverty mother of all arts, witless of all sin, bestower of all glory, 
<A NAME="627"></A>crowned with all honour among all the peoples of the world. Take the history 
<A NAME="628"></A>of Greece: the justice of poverty is seen in Aristides, her benignity in 
<A NAME="629"></A>Phocion, her force in Epaminondas, her wisdom in Socrates, her eloquence 
<A NAME="630"></A>in Homer. It was this same poverty that established the empire of the Roman 
<A NAME="631"></A>people in its first beginnings, and even to this day Rome offers up thanksgivings 
<A NAME="632"></A>for it to the immortal gods with libations poured from a wooden ladle and 
<A NAME="633"></A>offerings borne in an earthen platter. If the judges sitting to try this 
<A NAME="634"></A>case were Caius Fabricius, Gnaeus Scipio, Manius Curius, whose daughters 
<A NAME="635"></A>on account of their poverty were given dowries from the public treasury 
<A NAME="636"></A>and so went to their husbands bringing with them the honour of their houses 
<A NAME="637"></A>and the wealth of the state; if Publicola, who drove out the Kings, or 
<A NAME="638"></A>Agrippa, the healer of the people's strife, men whose funerals were on 
<A NAME="639"></A>account of their poverty enriched by the gift of a few farthings per man 
<A NAME="640"></A>from the whole Roman people; if Atilius Regulus, whose lands on account 
<A NAME="641"></A>of his own poverty were cultivated at the public expense; if, in a word, 
<A NAME="642"></A>all the heroes of the old Roman stock, consuls and censors and triumphant 
<A NAME="643"></A>generals, were given a brief renewal of life and sent back to earth to 
<A NAME="644"></A>give hearing to this case, would you dare in the presence of so many poor 
<A NAME="645"></A>consuls to reproach a philosopher with poverty?
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="646"></A><B>Part 19</B>

<A NAME="647"></A><BR><BR>Perhaps Claudius Maximus seems to you to be a suitable person before 
<A NAME="648"></A>whom to deride poverty, because he himself is in enjoyment of great wealth 
<A NAME="649"></A>and enormous opulence? You are wrong, Aemilianus, you are wholly mistaken 
<A NAME="650"></A>in your estimate of his character, if you take the bounty of his fortune 
<A NAME="651"></A>rather than the sternness of his philosophy as the standard for your judgement 
<A NAME="652"></A>and fail to realize that one, who holds so austere a creed and has so long 
<A NAME="653"></A>endured military service, is more likely to befriend a moderate fortune 
<A NAME="654"></A>with all its limitations than opulence with all its luxury, and holds that 
<A NAME="655"></A>fortunes, like tunics, should be comfortable, not long. For even a Fortune, 
<A NAME="656"></A>if cannot be carried but must be dragged, will entangle and trip the feet 
<A NAME="657"></A>as badly as a cloak that hangs down in front. In everything that we employ 
<A NAME="658"></A>for the needs of daily life, whatever exceeds the mean is superfluous and 
<A NAME="659"></A>a burden rather than a help. So it is that excessive riches, like steering 
<A NAME="660"></A>oars of too great weight and bulk, serve to sink the ship rather than to 
<A NAME="661"></A>guide it; for their bulk is unprofitable and their superfluity a 
<A NAME="662"></A>curse.
<A NAME="663"></A><BR><BR>I have noticed that of the wealthy themselves those win most praise 
<A NAME="664"></A>who live quietly and in moderate comfort, concealing their actual resources, 
<A NAME="665"></A>administering their great possessions without ostentation or pride and 
<A NAME="666"></A>showing like poor folk under the disguise of their moderation. Now, if 
<A NAME="667"></A>even the rich to some extent affect the outward form and semblance of poverty 
<A NAME="668"></A>to give evidence of their moderation, why should we of slenderer means 
<A NAME="669"></A>be ashamed of being poor not in appearance only but in 
<A NAME="670"></A>reality?
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="671"></A><B>Part 20</B>

<A NAME="672"></A><BR><BR>I might even engage with you in controversy over the word poverty, 
<A NAME="673"></A>urging that no man is poor who rejects the superfluous and has at his command 
<A NAME="674"></A>all the necessities of life, which nature has ordained should be exceedingly 
<A NAME="675"></A>small. For he who desires least will possess most, inasmuch as he who wants 
<A NAME="676"></A>but little will have all he wants. The measure of wealth ought therefore 
<A NAME="677"></A>not to be the possession of lands and investments, but the very soul of 
<A NAME="678"></A>man. For if avarice make him continually in need of some fresh acquisition 
<A NAME="679"></A>and insatiable in his lust for gain, not even mountains of gold will bring 
<A NAME="680"></A>him satisfaction, but he will always be begging for more that he may increase 
<A NAME="681"></A>what he already possesses. That is the genuine admission of poverty. For 
<A NAME="682"></A>every desire for fresh acquisition springs from the consciousness of want, 
<A NAME="683"></A>and it matters little how large your possessions are if they are too small 
<A NAME="684"></A>for you. Philus had a far smaller household than Laelius, Laelius than 
<A NAME="685"></A>Scipio, Scipio than Crassus the Rich, and yet not even Crassus had as much 
<A NAME="686"></A>as he wanted; and so, though he surpassed all others in wealth, he was 
<A NAME="687"></A>himself surpassed by his own avarice and seemed rich to all save himself. 
<A NAME="688"></A>On the other hand, the philosophers of whom I have spoken wanted nothing 
<A NAME="689"></A>beyond what was at their disposal, and, thanks to the harmong existing 
<A NAME="690"></A>between their desires and their resources, they were deservedly rich and 
<A NAME="691"></A>happy. For poverty consists in the need for fresh acquisition, wealth in 
<A NAME="692"></A>the satisfaction springing from the absence of needs. For the badge of 
<A NAME="693"></A>penury is desire, the badge of wealth contempt.
<A NAME="694"></A><BR><BR>Therefore, Aemilianus, if you wish me to be regarded as poor, you 
<A NAME="695"></A>must first prove that I am avaricious. But if my soul lacks nothing, I 
<A NAME="696"></A>care little how much of the goods of this world be lacking to me; for it 
<A NAME="697"></A>is no honour to possess them and no reproach to lack 
<A NAME="698"></A>them.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="699"></A><B>Part 21</B>

<A NAME="700"></A><BR><BR>But let us suppose it to be otherwise. Suppose that I am poor, 
<A NAME="701"></A>because fortune has grudged me riches, because my guardian, as often happens, 
<A NAME="702"></A>misappropriated my inheritance, some enemy robbed me, or my father left 
<A NAME="703"></A>me nothing. Is it just to reproach a man for that which is regarded as 
<A NAME="704"></A>no reproach to the animal kingdom, to the eagle, to the bull, to the lion? 
<A NAME="705"></A>lf the horse is strong in the possession of his peculiar excellences, if 
<A NAME="706"></A>he is pleasant to ride and swift in his paces, no one rebukes him for the 
<A NAME="707"></A>poverty of his food. Must you then reproach me, not for any scandalous 
<A NAME="708"></A>word or deed, but simply because I live in a small house, possess an unusually 
<A NAME="709"></A>small number of slaves, subsist on unusually light diet, wear unusually 
<A NAME="710"></A>light clothing, and make unusually small purchaches of 
<A NAME="711"></A>food?
<A NAME="712"></A><BR><BR>Yet however scanty my service, food, and raiment may seem to you, 
<A NAME="713"></A>I on the contrary regard them as ample and even excessive. Indeed I am 
<A NAME="714"></A>desirous of still further reducing them, since the leas I have to distract 
<A NAME="715"></A>me the happier I shall be. For the soul, like the body, goes lightly clad 
<A NAME="716"></A>when in good health; weakness wraps itself up, and it is a sure sign of 
<A NAME="717"></A>infirmity to have many wants. We live, just as we swim, all the better 
<A NAME="718"></A>for being but lightly burdened. For in this stormy life as on the stormy 
<A NAME="719"></A>ocean heavy things sink us and light things buoy us up. It is in this respect, 
<A NAME="720"></A>I find, that the gods more especially surpass men, namely that they lack 
<A NAME="721"></A>nothing: wherefore he of mankind whose needs are smallest is most like 
<A NAME="722"></A>unto the gods.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="723"></A><B>Part 22</B>

<A NAME="724"></A><BR><BR>I therefore regarded it as a compliment when to insult me you asserted 
<A NAME="725"></A>that my whole household consisted of a wallet and a staff. Would that my 
<A NAME="726"></A>spirit were made of such stern stuff as to permit me to dispense with all 
<A NAME="727"></A>this furniture and worthily to carry that equipment for which Crates sacrificed 
<A NAME="728"></A>all his wealth! Crates, I tell you, though I doubt if you will believe 
<A NAME="729"></A>me, Aemilianus, was a man of great wealth and honour among the nobility 
<A NAME="730"></A>of Thebes; but for love of this habit, which you cast in my face as a crime, 
<A NAME="731"></A>he gave his large and luxurious household to his fellow citizens, resigned 
<A NAME="732"></A>his troops of slaves for solitude, so contemned the countless trees of 
<A NAME="733"></A>his rich orchards as to be content with one staff, exchanged his elegant 
<A NAME="734"></A>villas for one small wallet, which, when he had fully appreciated its utility, 
<A NAME="735"></A>he even praised in song by diverting from their original meaning certain 
<A NAME="736"></A>lines of Homer in which he extols the island of Crete. I will quote the 
<A NAME="737"></A>first lines, that you may not think this a mere invention of mine designed 
<A NAME="738"></A>to meet the needs of my own case:
<A NAME="739"></A><BR><BR>There is a twon named Wallet in the midst
<A NAME="740"></A><BR>of smoke that's dark as wine.
<A NAME="741"></A><BR><BR>The lines which follow are so wonderful, that had you read them 
<A NAME="742"></A>you would envy me my wallet even more than you envy me my marriage with 
<A NAME="743"></A>Pudentilla.
<A NAME="744"></A><BR><BR>You reproach philosophers for their staff and wallet. You might 
<A NAME="745"></A>as well reproach cavalry for their trappings, infantry for their shields, 
<A NAME="746"></A>standard-bearers for their banners, triumphant generals for their chariots 
<A NAME="747"></A>drawn by four white horses and their cloaks embroidered with palmleaves. 
<A NAME="748"></A>The staff and wallet are not, it is true, carried by the Platonic philosophers, 
<A NAME="749"></A>but are the badges of the Cynic school. To Diogenes and Antisthenes they 
<A NAME="750"></A>were what the crown is to the king, the cloak of purple to the general, 
<A NAME="751"></A>the cowl to the priest, the trumpet to the augur. Indeed the Cynic Diogenes, 
<A NAME="752"></A>when he disputed with Alexander the Great, as to which of the two was the 
<A NAME="753"></A>true king, boasted of his staff as the true sceptre. The unconquered Hercules 
<A NAME="754"></A>himself, since you despise my instances as drawn from mere mendicancy, 
<A NAME="755"></A>Hercules that roamed the whole world, exterminated monsters, and conquered 
<A NAME="756"></A>races, god though he was, had but a skin for raiment and a staff for company 
<A NAME="757"></A>in the days when he wandered through the earth. And yet but a brief while 
<A NAME="758"></A>afterwards he was admitted to heaven as a reward for his 
<A NAME="759"></A>virtue.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="760"></A><B>Part 23</B>

<A NAME="761"></A><BR><BR>But if you despise these examples and challenge me, not to plead 
<A NAME="762"></A>my case, but to enter into a discussion of the amount of my fortune, to 
<A NAME="763"></A>put an end to your ignorance on this point, if it exists, I acknowledge 
<A NAME="764"></A>that my father left my brother and myself a little under 2,000,000 sesterces 
<A NAME="765"></A>-- a sum on which my lengthy travels, continual studies, and frequent generosity 
<A NAME="766"></A>have made considerable inroads. For I have often assisted my friends and 
<A NAME="767"></A>have shown substantial gratitude to many of my instructors, on more than 
<A NAME="768"></A>one occasion going so far as to provide dowries for their daughters. Nay, 
<A NAME="769"></A>I should not have hesitated to expend every farthing of my patrimony, if 
<A NAME="770"></A>so I might acquire what is far better by contempt for my patrimony. But 
<A NAME="771"></A>as for you, Aemilianus, and ignorant boors of your kidney, in your case 
<A NAME="772"></A>the fortune makes the man. You are like barren and blasted trees that produce 
<A NAME="773"></A>no fruit, but are valued only for the timber that their trunks 
<A NAME="774"></A>contain.
<A NAME="775"></A><BR><BR>But I beg you, Aemilianus, in future to abstain from reviling any 
<A NAME="776"></A>one for their poverty, since you yourself used, after waiting for some 
<A NAME="777"></A>seasonable shower to soften the ground, to expend three days in ploughing 
<A NAME="778"></A>single-handed, with the aid of one wretched ass, that miserable farm at 
<A NAME="779"></A>Zarath, which was all your father left you. It is only recently that fortune 
<A NAME="780"></A>has smiled on you in the shape of wholly undeserved inheritances which 
<A NAME="781"></A>have fallen to you by the frequent deaths of relatives, deaths to which, 
<A NAME="782"></A>far more than to your hideous face, you owe your nickname of 
<A NAME="783"></A>Charon.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="784"></A><B>Part 24</B>

<A NAME="785"></A><BR><BR>As to my birthplace, you assert that my writings prove it to lie 
<A NAME="786"></A>right on the marches of Numidia and Gaetulia, for I publicly described 
<A NAME="787"></A>myself as half Numidian, half Gaetulian in a discourse delivered in the 
<A NAME="788"></A>presence of that most distinguished citizen Lollianus Avitus. I do not 
<A NAME="789"></A>see that I have any more reason to be ashamed of that than had the elder 
<A NAME="790"></A>Cyrus for being of mixed descent, half Mede, half Persian. A man's birthplace 
<A NAME="791"></A>is of no importance, it is his character that matters. We must consider 
<A NAME="792"></A>not in what part of the world, but with what purpose he set out to live 
<A NAME="793"></A>his life. Sellers of wine and cabbages are permitted to enhance the value 
<A NAME="794"></A>of their wares by advertising the excellence of the soil whence they spring, 
<A NAME="795"></A>as for instance with the wine of Thasos and the cabbages of Phlius. For 
<A NAME="796"></A>those products of the soil are wonderfully improved in flavour by the fertility 
<A NAME="797"></A>of the district which produces them, the moistness of the climate, the 
<A NAME="798"></A>mildness of the winds, the warmth of the sun, and the richness of the soil. 
<A NAME="799"></A>But in the case of man, the soul enters the tenement of the body from without. 
<A NAME="800"></A>What, then, can such circumstances as these add to or take away from his 
<A NAME="801"></A>virtues or his vices? Has there ever been a time or place in which a race 
<A NAME="802"></A>has not produced a variety of intellects, although some races seem stupider 
<A NAME="803"></A>and some wiser than others? The Scythians are the stupidest of men, and 
<A NAME="804"></A>yet the wise Anacharsis was a Scyth. The Athenians are shrewd, and yet 
<A NAME="805"></A>the Athenian Meletides was a fool.
<A NAME="806"></A><BR><BR>I say this not because I am ashamed of my country, since even in 
<A NAME="807"></A>the time of Syphax we were a township. When he was conquered we were transferred 
<A NAME="808"></A>by the gift of the Roman people to the dominion of King Masinissa, and 
<A NAME="809"></A>finally as the result of a settlement of veteran soldiers, our second founders, 
<A NAME="810"></A>we have become a colony of the highest distinction. In this same colony 
<A NAME="811"></A>my father attained to the post of duumvir and became the foremost citizen 
<A NAME="812"></A>of the place, after filling all the municipal offices of honour. I myself, 
<A NAME="813"></A>immediately after my first entry into the municipal senate, succeeded to 
<A NAME="814"></A>my father's position in the community, and, as I hope, am in no ways a 
<A NAME="815"></A>degenerate successor, but receive like honour and esteem for my maintenance 
<A NAME="816"></A>of the dignity of my position. Why do I mention this? That you, Aemilianus, 
<A NAME="817"></A>may be less angry with me in future and may more readily pardon me for 
<A NAME="818"></A>having been negligent enough not to select your `Attic' Zarath for my 
<A NAME="819"></A>birthplace.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="820"></A><B>Part 25</B>

<A NAME="821"></A><BR><BR>Are you not ashamed to produce such accusations with such violence 
<A NAME="822"></A>before such a judge, to bring forward frivolous and self-contradictory 
<A NAME="823"></A>accusations, and then in the same breath to blame me on both charges at 
<A NAME="824"></A>once? Is it not a sheer contradiction to object to my wallet and staff 
<A NAME="825"></A>on the ground of austerity, to my poems and mirror on the ground of undue 
<A NAME="826"></A>levity; to accuse me of parsimony for having only one slave, and of extravagance 
<A NAME="827"></A>in having three; to denounce me for my Greek eloquence and my barbarian 
<A NAME="828"></A>birth? Awake from your slumber and remember that you are speaking before 
<A NAME="829"></A>Claudius Maximus, a man of stern character, burdened with the business 
<A NAME="830"></A>of the whole province. Cease, I say, to bring forward these empty slanders. 
<A NAME="831"></A>Prove your indictment, prove that I am guilty of ghastly crimes, detestable 
<A NAME="832"></A>sorceries, and black art-magic. Why is it that the strength of your speech 
<A NAME="833"></A>lies in mere noise, while it is weak and flabby in point of 
<A NAME="834"></A>facts?
<A NAME="835"></A><BR><BR>I will now deal with the actual charge of magic. You spared no 
<A NAME="836"></A>violence in fanning the flame of hatred against me. But you have disappointed 
<A NAME="837"></A>all men's expectations by your old wives' fables, and the fire kindled 
<A NAME="838"></A>by your accusations has burned itself away. I ask you, Maximus, have you 
<A NAME="839"></A>ever seen fire spring up among the stubble, crackling sharply, blazing 
<A NAME="840"></A>wide and spreading fast, but soon exhausting its flimsy fuel, dying fast 
<A NAME="841"></A>away, leaving not a wrack behind? So they have kindled their accusation 
<A NAME="842"></A>with abuse and fanned it with words, but it lacks the fuel of facts and, 
<A NAME="843"></A>your verdict once given, is destined to leave not a wrack of calumny behind. 
<A NAME="844"></A>The whole of Aemilianus' calumnious accusation was centred in the charge 
<A NAME="845"></A>of magic. I should therefore like to ask his most learned advocates how, 
<A NAME="846"></A>precisely, they would define a magician.
<A NAME="847"></A><BR><BR>If what I read in a large number of authors is true, namely, that 
<A NAME="848"></A>magician is the Persian word for priest, what is there criminal in being 
<A NAME="849"></A>a priest and having due knowledge, science, and skill in all ceremonial 
<A NAME="850"></A>law, sacrificial duties, and the binding rules of religion, at least if 
<A NAME="851"></A>magic consists in that which Plato sets forth in his description of the 
<A NAME="852"></A>methods employed by the Persians in the education of their young princes? 
<A NAME="853"></A>I remember the very words of that divine philosopher. Let me recall them 
<A NAME="854"></A>to your memory, Maximus:
<A NAME="855"></A><BR><BR>When the boy has reached the age of fourteen he is handed over 
<A NAME="856"></A>to the care of men known as the Royal Masters. They are four in number, 
<A NAME="857"></A>and are chosen as being the best of the elders of Persia, one the wisest, 
<A NAME="858"></A>another the justest, a third the most temperate, a fourth the bravest. 
<A NAME="859"></A>And one of these teaches the boy the magic of Zoroaster the son of Oromazes; 
<A NAME="860"></A>and this magic is no other than the worship of the gods. He also teaches 
<A NAME="861"></A>him the arts of kingship.
