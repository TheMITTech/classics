<A NAME="10"></A><B>Part 76</B>
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="11"></A>His wife, however, was getting old and worn out and gave up the whole household 
<A NAME="12"></A>to dishonour. But there was a daughter who, at her mother's instigation, 
<A NAME="13"></A>was exhibited to all the wealthy young men, but in vain. To some of the 
<A NAME="14"></A>suitors she was even given to try. Had she not come across so easy a victim 
<A NAME="15"></A>as Pontianus, she would perhaps still have been sitting at home a widow 
<A NAME="16"></A>who had never been a bride. Pontianus, in spite of urgent attempts on our 
<A NAME="17"></A>part to dissuade him, gave her the right -- false and illusory though it 
<A NAME="18"></A>was -- to be called a bride. He did this knowing that, but a short time 
<A NAME="19"></A>before he married her, she had been deserted by a young man of good family 
<A NAME="20"></A>to whom she had been previously betrothed, after he had had enough of 
<A NAME="21"></A>her.
<A NAME="22"></A><BR><BR>And so his new bride came to him, not as other brides come, but 
<A NAME="23"></A>unabashed and undismayed, her virtue lost, her modesty gone, her bridal-veil 
<A NAME="24"></A>a mockery. Cast off by her previous lover, she brought to her wedding the 
<A NAME="25"></A>name without the purity of a maid. She rode in a litter carried by eight 
<A NAME="26"></A>slaves. You who were present saw how impudently she made eyes at all the 
<A NAME="27"></A>young and how immodestly she flaunted her charms. Who did not recognize 
<A NAME="28"></A>her mother's pupil, when they saw her dyed lips, her rouged cheeks, and 
<A NAME="29"></A>her lascivious eyes? Her dowry was borrowed, every penny of it, on the 
<A NAME="30"></A>eve of her wedding, and was indeed greater than could be expected of so 
<A NAME="31"></A>large and impoverished a family.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="32"></A><B>Part 77</B>

<A NAME="33"></A><BR><BR>But though Rufinus' fortune is small, his hopes are boundless. 
<A NAME="34"></A>With avarice rivalled only by his need he had already devoured Pudentilla's 
<A NAME="35"></A>4,000,000 in vain anticipation. With this in view he decided that I must 
<A NAME="36"></A>be got out of the way, in order that he might find fewer obstacles in his 
<A NAME="37"></A>attempt to hoodwink the weak Pontianus and the lonely Pudentilla. He began, 
<A NAME="38"></A>therefore, to upbraid his son-in-law for having betrothed his mother to 
<A NAME="39"></A>me. He urged him to draw back without delay from so perilous a path, while 
<A NAME="40"></A>there was yet time; to keep his mother's fortune himself rather than deliberately 
<A NAME="41"></A>transfer it to the keeping of a stranger. He threatened that, if he refused, 
<A NAME="42"></A>he would take away his daughter, the device of an old hand to influence 
<A NAME="43"></A>a young man in love.
<A NAME="44"></A><BR><BR>To be brief, he so wrought upon the simple-minded young man, who 
<A NAME="45"></A>was, moreover, a slave to the charms of his new bride, as to mould him 
<A NAME="46"></A>to his will and move him from his purpose. Pontianus went to his mother 
<A NAME="47"></A>and told her what Rufinus had said to him. But he made no impression on 
<A NAME="48"></A>her steadfast character. On the contrary, she rebuked him for his fickleness 
<A NAME="49"></A>and inconstancy, and it was no pleasant news he took back to his father-in-law. 
<A NAME="50"></A>His mother had shown a firmness of purpose not to be expected of one of 
<A NAME="51"></A>her placid disposition, and to make matters worse, his expostulations had 
<A NAME="52"></A>made her angry, which was likely seriously to increase her obstinacy; in 
<A NAME="53"></A>fact, she had finally replied, that it was no secret to her that his expostulations 
<A NAME="54"></A>were instigated by Rufinus, a fact which made the support and assistance 
<A NAME="55"></A>of a husband against his desperate greed all the more necessary to 
<A NAME="56"></A>her.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="57"></A><B>Part 78</B>

<A NAME="58"></A><BR><BR>When he heard this, the ruffian was stung to fury and burst into 
<A NAME="59"></A>such wild and ungovernable rage that in the presence of her own son he 
<A NAME="60"></A>heaped insults, such as he might have used to his own wife, on the purest 
<A NAME="61"></A>and most modest of women. In the presence of many witnesses, whom, if you 
<A NAME="62"></A>desire it, I will name, he loudly denounced her as a wanton and myself 
<A NAME="63"></A>as a sorcerer and poisoner, threatening to murder me with his own hands. 
<A NAME="64"></A>I can hardly restrain my anger, such fierce indignation fills my soul. 
<A NAME="65"></A>That you, the most effeminate of men, should threaten any man with death 
<A NAME="66"></A>at your hand! What hand? The hand of Philomela or Medea or Clytemnestra? 
<A NAME="67"></A>Why, when you dance in those characters you show such contemptible timidity, 
<A NAME="68"></A>you are so frightened at the sight of steel, that you will not even carry 
<A NAME="69"></A>a property sword.
<A NAME="70"></A><BR><BR>But I am digressing. Pudentilla, seeing to her astonishment that 
<A NAME="71"></A>her son had fallen lower than she could have deemed possible, went into 
<A NAME="72"></A>the country and by way of rebuke wrote him the notorious letter, in which, 
<A NAME="73"></A>according to my accusers, she confessed that my magical practices had made 
<A NAME="74"></A>her lose her reason and fall in love with me. And yet, Maximus, the day 
<A NAME="75"></A>before yesterday at your command I took a copy of the letter in the presence 
<A NAME="76"></A>of witnesses and of Pontianus' secretary. Aemilianus also was there and 
<A NAME="77"></A>countersigned the copy. What is the result? In contradiction to my accusers' 
<A NAME="78"></A>assertion everything is found to tell in my favour.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="79"></A><B>Part 79</B>

<A NAME="80"></A><BR><BR>And yet, even if she had spoken somewhat strongly and had called 
<A NAME="81"></A>me a magician, it would be a reasonable explanation that she had, in defending 
<A NAME="82"></A>her conduct to her son, preferred to allege compulsion on my part rather 
<A NAME="83"></A>than her own inclination. Is Phaedra the only woman whom love has driven 
<A NAME="84"></A>to write a lying letter? Is it not rather a device common to all women 
<A NAME="85"></A>that, when they have begun to feel strong desire for anything of this kind, 
<A NAME="86"></A>they should prefer to make themselves out the victims of compulsion? But 
<A NAME="87"></A>even supposing she had genuinely regarded me as a magician, would the mere 
<A NAME="88"></A>fact of Pudentilla's writing to that effect be a reason for actually regarding 
<A NAME="89"></A>me as a magician? You, with all your arguments and your witnesses and your 
<A NAME="90"></A>diffuse eloquence, have failed to prove me a magician. Could she prove 
<A NAME="91"></A>it with one word? A formal indictment, written and signed before a judge, 
<A NAME="92"></A>is a far more weighty document than what is written in a private letter! 
<A NAME="93"></A>Why do not you prove me a magician by my own deeds instead of having recourse 
<A NAME="94"></A>to the mere words of another?
<A NAME="95"></A><BR><BR>If your principle be followed, and whatever any one may have written 
<A NAME="96"></A>in a letter under the influence of love or hatred be admitted as proof, 
<A NAME="97"></A>many a man will be indicted on the wildest charges. `Pudentilla called 
<A NAME="98"></A>you a magician in her letter; therefore you are a magician!' If she had 
<A NAME="99"></A>called me a consul, would that make me one? What if she had called me a 
<A NAME="100"></A>painter, a doctor, or even an innocent man? Would you accept any of these 
<A NAME="101"></A>statements, simply because she had made them? You would accept none of 
<A NAME="102"></A>them. Yet it is a gross injustice to believe a person when he speaks evil 
<A NAME="103"></A>of another and to refuse to believe him when he speaks well. It is a gross 
<A NAME="104"></A>injustice that a letter should have power to destroy and not to save. - 
<A NAME="105"></A>`But,' says my accuser, `she was out of her wits, she loved you distractedly.' 
<A NAME="106"></A>I will grant it for the moment. But are all persons, who are the objects 
<A NAME="107"></A>of love, magicians, just because the person in love with them chances to 
<A NAME="108"></A>say so in a letter? If, indeed, Pudentilla wrote in a letter to another 
<A NAME="109"></A>person what would clearly be prejudicial to myself, I think she could hardly 
<A NAME="110"></A>have been in love with me at the moment in question.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="111"></A><B>Part 80</B>

<A NAME="112"></A><BR><BR>Tell me now, what is your contention: was she mad or sane when 
<A NAME="113"></A>she wrote? Sane, do you say? Then she was not the victim of magic. Insane? 
<A NAME="114"></A>In that case she did not know what she was writing and must not be believed. 
<A NAME="115"></A>Nay, even supposing her to have been insane, she would not have been aware 
<A NAME="116"></A>of the fact. For just as to say `I am silent' is to make a fool of oneself, 
<A NAME="117"></A>since these very words actually break silence, and the act of speaking 
<A NAME="118"></A>impugns the substance of one's speech, so it is even more absurd to say 
<A NAME="119"></A>`I am mad'. It cannot be true unless the speaker knows what he says, and 
<A NAME="120"></A>he who knows what madness is, is ipso facto sane. For madness cannot know 
<A NAME="121"></A>itself any more than blindness can see itself. Therefore Pudentilla was 
<A NAME="122"></A>in possession of her senses, if she thought she was out of them. I could 
<A NAME="123"></A>say more on this point, but enough of dialectic!
<A NAME="124"></A><BR><BR>I will read out the letter which gives crying witness to a very 
<A NAME="125"></A>different state of things and might indeed have been specially prepared 
<A NAME="126"></A>to suit this particular trial. Take it and read it out until I 
<A NAME="127"></A>interrupt.
<A NAME="128"></A><BR><BR>Stop a moment before you go on to what follows. We have come to 
<A NAME="129"></A>the crucial point. So far, Maximus, as far at any rate as I have noticed, 
<A NAME="130"></A>the lady has made no mention of magic, but has merely repeated in the same 
<A NAME="131"></A>order the statements which I quoted a short time ago about her long widowhood, 
<A NAME="132"></A>the proposed remedy for her ill health, her desire to marry, the good report 
<A NAME="133"></A>she had heard of me from Pontianus, his own advice that she should marry 
<A NAME="134"></A>me in preference to others.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="135"></A><B>Part 81</B>

<A NAME="136"></A><BR><BR>So much for what has been read. There remains a portion of the 
<A NAME="137"></A>letter which, although like the first part it was written in my defence, 
<A NAME="138"></A>also turns against me. For although it was specially written to rebut the 
<A NAME="139"></A>charge of magic brought against me, a remarkable piece of ingenuity on 
<A NAME="140"></A>the part of Rufinus has altered its meaning and brought me into discredit 
<A NAME="141"></A>with certain citizens of Oea as being a proved sorcerer.
<A NAME="142"></A><BR><BR>Maximus, you have heard much from the lips of others, you have 
<A NAME="143"></A>learned yet more by reading, and your own personal experience has taught 
<A NAME="144"></A>you not a little. But you will say that never yet have you come across 
<A NAME="145"></A>such insidious cunning or such marvellous dexterity in crime. What Palamedes, 
<A NAME="146"></A>what Sisyphus, what Eurybates or Phrynondas could ever have devised such 
<A NAME="147"></A>guile? All those whom I have mentioned, together with all the notorious 
<A NAME="148"></A>deceivers of history, would seem mere clowns and pantaloons, were they 
<A NAME="149"></A>to attempt to match this one single instince of Rufinus' craftiness. O 
<A NAME="150"></A>miracle of lies! O subtlety worthy of the prison and the stocks! Who could 
<A NAME="151"></A>imagine that what was written as a defence could without the alteration 
<A NAME="152"></A>of a single letter be transformed into an accusation! Good God! it is incredible. 
<A NAME="153"></A>But I will make clear to you how the incredible came to 
<A NAME="154"></A>pass.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="155"></A><B>Part 82</B>

<A NAME="156"></A><BR><BR>The mother was rebuking her son because, after extolling me to 
<A NAME="157"></A>her as a model of all the virtues, he now, at Rufinus' instigation, asserted 
<A NAME="158"></A>that I was a magician. The actual words were as follows:
<A NAME="159"></A><BR><BR>Apuleius is a magician and has bewitched me to love him! Come to 
<A NAME="160"></A>me, then, while I am still in my senses.
<A NAME="161"></A><BR><BR>These words, which I have quoted in Greek, have been selected by 
<A NAME="162"></A>Rufinus and separated from their context. He has taken them round as a 
<A NAME="163"></A>confession on the part of Pudentilla, and, with Pontianus at his side all 
<A NAME="164"></A>dissolved in tears, has shown them through all the market-place, allowing 
<A NAME="165"></A>men only to read that portion which I have just cited and suppressing all 
<A NAME="166"></A>that comes before and after. His excuse was that the rest of the letter 
<A NAME="167"></A>was too disgusting to be shown; it was sufficient that publicity should 
<A NAME="168"></A>be given to Pudentilla's confession as to my sorcery.
<A NAME="169"></A><BR><BR>What was the result? Everyone thought it probable enough. That 
<A NAME="170"></A>very letter, which was written to clear my character, excited the most 
<A NAME="171"></A>violent hatred against me amongst those who did not know the facts. This 
<A NAME="172"></A>foul villain went rushing about in the midst of the market-place like any 
<A NAME="173"></A>bacchanal; he kept opening the letter and proclaiming, `Apuleius is a sorcerer! 
<A NAME="174"></A>She herself describes her feelings and her sufferings! What more do you 
<A NAME="175"></A>demand?' There was no one to take my part and reply, `Give us the whole 
<A NAME="176"></A>letter, please! Let me see it all, let me read it from beginning to end. 
<A NAME="177"></A>There are many things which, produced apart from their context, may seem 
<A NAME="178"></A>open to a slanderous inter-pretation. Any speech may be attacked, if a 
<A NAME="179"></A>passage depending for its sense on what has preceded be robbed of its commencement, 
<A NAME="180"></A>or if phrases be expunged at will from the place they logically occupy, 
<A NAME="181"></A>or if what is written ironically be read out in such a tone as to make 
<A NAME="182"></A>it seem a defamatory statement.'
<A NAME="183"></A><BR><BR>With what justice this protest or words to that effect might have 
<A NAME="184"></A>been uttered the actual order of the letter will show.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="185"></A><B>Part 83</B>

<A NAME="186"></A><BR><BR>Now, Aemilianus, try to remember whether the following were not 
<A NAME="187"></A>the words of which, together with myself, you took a copy in the presence 
<A NAME="188"></A>of witnesses.
<A NAME="189"></A><BR><BR>For since I desired to marry for the reasons of which I told you, 
<A NAME="190"></A>you persuaded me to choose Apuleius in preference to all others, since 
<A NAME="191"></A>you had a great admiration for him and were eager through me to become 
<A NAME="192"></A>yet more intimate with him. But now that certain ill-natured persons have 
<A NAME="193"></A>brought accusations against us and attempt to dissuade you, Apuleius has 
<A NAME="194"></A>suddenly become a magician and has bewitched me to love him! Come to me, 
<A NAME="195"></A>then, while I am still in my senses.
<A NAME="196"></A><BR><BR>I ask you, Maximus, if letters -- some of which are actually called 
<A NAME="197"></A>vocal -- could find a voice, if words, as poets say, could take them wings 
<A NAME="198"></A>and fly, would they not, when Rufinus first made disingenuous excerpts 
<A NAME="199"></A>from that letter, read but a few lines and deliberately said nothing of 
<A NAME="200"></A>much that bore a more favourable meaning, would not the remaining letters 
<A NAME="201"></A>have cried out that they were unjustly kept out of sight? Would not the 
<A NAME="202"></A>words suppressed by Rufinus have flown from his hands and filled the whole 
<A NAME="203"></A>market-place with tumult: `they too had been sent by Pudentilla, they too 
<A NAME="204"></A>had been entrusted with something to say; men should not give ear to a 
<A NAME="205"></A>dishonest villain attempting to prove a lie by means of another's letter, 
<A NAME="206"></A>but rather listen to them; Pudentilla never accused Apuleius of magic, 
<A NAME="207"></A>while Rufinus' accusation was tantamount to an acquittal.' All these things 
<A NAME="208"></A>were not said then, but now, when they are of more effectual service to 
<A NAME="209"></A>me, their truth appears clearer than day. Rufinus, your cunning stands 
<A NAME="210"></A>revealed, your fraud stares us in the face, your lies are laid bare; truth 
<A NAME="211"></A>dethroned for a while rises once more and transcends slander as if from 
<A NAME="212"></A>a bottomless pit.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="213"></A><B>Part 84</B>

<A NAME="214"></A><BR><BR>You challenged me with Pudentilla's letter: with that letter I 
<A NAME="215"></A>win the day. If you like to hear the conclusion, I will not grudge it you. 
<A NAME="216"></A>Tell me, what were the words with which she ended the letter, that poor 
<A NAME="217"></A>bewitched, lunatic, insane, infatuated lady?
<A NAME="218"></A><BR><BR>I am not bewitched, I am not in love; it is my 
<A NAME="219"></A>destiny.
<A NAME="220"></A><BR><BR>Would you have anything more? Pudentilla throws your words in your 
<A NAME="221"></A>teeth and publicly vindicates her sanity against your slanderous aspersions. 
<A NAME="222"></A>The motive or necessity of her marriage, whichever it was, she now ascribes 
<A NAME="223"></A>to fate, and between fate and magic there is a great gulf, indeed they 
<A NAME="224"></A>have absolutely nothing in common. For if it be true that the destiny of 
<A NAME="225"></A>each created thing is like a fierce torrent that may neither be stayed 
<A NAME="226"></A>nor diverted, what power is left for magic drugs or incantations? Pudentilla, 
<A NAME="227"></A>therefore, not only denied that I was a magician, but denied the very existence 
<A NAME="228"></A>of magic. It is a good thing that Pontianus, following his usual custom, 
<A NAME="229"></A>kept his mother's letter safe in its entirety: it is a good thing that 
<A NAME="230"></A>the speed with which this case has been hurried on left you no opportunity 
<A NAME="231"></A>for adding to that letter at your leisure. For this I have to thank you 
<A NAME="232"></A>and your foresight, Maximus. You saw through their slanders from the beginning 
<A NAME="233"></A>and hurried on the case that they might not gather strength as the days 
<A NAME="234"></A>went by; you gave them no breathing space and wrecked their 
<A NAME="235"></A>designs.
<A NAME="236"></A><BR><BR>Suppose now that the mother, after her wont, had made confession 
<A NAME="237"></A>of her passion for me in some private letter to her son. Was it just, Rufinus, 
<A NAME="238"></A>was it consistent, I will not say with filial piety but with common humanity, 
<A NAME="239"></A>that these letters should be circulated and, above all, published and proclaimed 
<A NAME="240"></A>abroad by her own son? But perhaps I am no better than a fool to ask you 
<A NAME="241"></A>to have regard for another's sense of decency when you have so long lost 
<A NAME="242"></A>your own.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="243"></A><B>Part 85</B>

<A NAME="244"></A><BR><BR>Why should I only complain of what is past? The present is equally 
<A NAME="245"></A>distressing. To think that this unhappy boy should have been so corrupted 
<A NAME="246"></A>by you as to read aloud in the proconsular court, before a man of such 
<A NAME="247"></A>lofty character as Claudius Maximus, a letter from his mother, which he 
<A NAME="248"></A>chooses to regard as amatory, and in the presence of the statues of the 
<A NAME="249"></A>emperor Pius to accuse his mother of yielding to a shameful passion and 
<A NAME="250"></A>reproach her with her amours? Who is there of such gentle temper, but that 
<A NAME="251"></A>this would wake him to fury? Vilest of creatures, do you pry into your 
<A NAME="252"></A>mother's heart in such matters, do you watch her glances, count her sighs, 
<A NAME="253"></A>sound her affections, intercept her letters, and accuse her of being in 
<A NAME="254"></A>love? Do you seek to discover what she does in the privacy of her own chamber, 
<A NAME="255"></A>do you demand -- I will not say that she should be above love affairs -- 
<A NAME="256"></A>but that she should cease to be a woman? Cannot you conceive the possibility 
<A NAME="257"></A>that she should show any affection save the affection of a mother for her 
<A NAME="258"></A>son? Ah! Pudentilla, you are unhappy in your offspring! Far better have 
<A NAME="259"></A>been barren than have borne such children! Ill-omened were the long months 
<A NAME="260"></A>through which you bore them in your womb and thankless your fourteen years 
<A NAME="261"></A>of widowhood! The viper, I am told, reaches the light of day only by gnawing 
<A NAME="262"></A>through its mother's womb; its parent must die before it is born. But your 
<A NAME="263"></A>son is fullgrown and the wounds he deals are far bitterer, for they are 
<A NAME="264"></A>inflicted on you while you yet live and see the light of day. He insults 
<A NAME="265"></A>your reserve, he arraigns your modesty, he wounds you to the heart and 
<A NAME="266"></A>outrages your dearest affections.
<A NAME="267"></A><BR><BR>Is this the gratitude with which a dutiful son like yourself repays 
<A NAME="268"></A>his mother for the life she gave him, for the inheritance she won him for 
<A NAME="269"></A>her long fourteen years of seclusion? Is the result of your uncle's teaching 
<A NAME="270"></A>this, that, if you were sure your sons would be like yourself, you should 
<A NAME="271"></A>be afraid to take a wife? There is a well-known line
<A NAME="272"></A><BR><BR>I hate the boy that's wise before his time.
<A NAME="273"></A><BR><BR>Yes, and who would not loathe and detest a boy that is `wicked 
<A NAME="274"></A>before his time,' when he sees you, like some frightful portent, old in 
<A NAME="275"></A>sin but young in years, with the bodily powers of a boy, yet deep in guilt, 
<A NAME="276"></A>with the bright face of a child, but with wickedness such as might match 
<A NAME="277"></A>grey hairs? Nay, the most offensive thing about him is that his pernicious 
<A NAME="278"></A>deeds go scot free; he is too young to punish, yet old enough to do injury. 
<A NAME="279"></A>Injury, did I say? No! crime, unfilial, black, monstrous, intolerable 
<A NAME="280"></A>crime!
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="281"></A><B>Part 86</B>

<A NAME="282"></A><BR><BR>The Athenians, when they captured the correspondence of their enemy, 
<A NAME="283"></A>Philip of Macedon, and the letters were being read in public one by one, 
<A NAME="284"></A>out of reverence for the common rights of humanity forbade one letter to 
<A NAME="285"></A>be read aloud, a letter addressed by Philip to his wife Olympias. They 
<A NAME="286"></A>spared the enemy that they might not intrude on the privacy of husband 
<A NAME="287"></A>and wife; they placed the law that is common to all mankind above the claims 
<A NAME="288"></A>of private vengeance. So enemy dealt with enemy! And how have you dealt 
<A NAME="289"></A>as son with his mother? You see how close is my parallel. Yet you read 
<A NAME="290"></A>out aloud lettcrs written by your mother which, according to your assertion, 
<A NAME="291"></A>concern her love affairs, and you do so before this gathering here assembled, 
<A NAME="292"></A>a gathering before which you would not dare to read the verses of some 
<A NAME="293"></A>obscene poet, even if bidden to do so, but you would be restrained by some 
<A NAME="294"></A>sense of shame. Nay, you would never have touched your mother's letters, 
<A NAME="295"></A>had you ever been in touch with letters.
<A NAME="296"></A><BR><BR>But you have also dared to submit a letter of your own to be read, 
<A NAME="297"></A>a letter written about your mother in outrageously disrespectful, abwive, 
<A NAME="298"></A>and unseemly language, written too at a time when you were still being 
<A NAME="299"></A>brought up under her loving care. This letter you sent secretly to Pontianus, 
<A NAME="300"></A>and you have now produced it to avoid the reproach of having sinned only 
<A NAME="301"></A>once and to make sure that he could catch a glance of your good deed! Poor 
<A NAME="302"></A>fool, do you not realize that your uncle permitted you to do this, that 
<A NAME="303"></A>he might clear himself in public estimation by using your letter as proof 
<A NAME="304"></A>that even before you migrated to his house, even at the time when you caressed 
<A NAME="305"></A>your mother with false words of love, you were already as cunning as any 
<A NAME="306"></A>fox and devoid of all filial affection?
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="307"></A><B>Part 87</B>

<A NAME="308"></A><BR><BR>But I cannot bring myself to believe Aemilianus such a fool as 
<A NAME="309"></A>to think that the letter of a mere boy, who is also one of my accusers, 
<A NAME="310"></A>could seriously tell against me.
<A NAME="311"></A><BR><BR>There is also that forged letter by which they attempted to prove 
<A NAME="312"></A>that I beguiled Pudentilla with flattery. I never wrote it and the forgery 
<A NAME="313"></A>is not even plausible. What need did I have of flattery, if I put my trust 
<A NAME="314"></A>in magic? And how did they secure possession of that letter which must, 
<A NAME="315"></A>as is usual in such affairs, have been sent to Pudentilla by some confidential 
<A NAME="316"></A>servant? Why, again, should I write in such faulty words, such barbarous 
<A NAME="317"></A>language, I whom my accusers admit to be quite at home in Greek? And why 
<A NAME="318"></A>should I seek to seduce her by flattery so absurd and coarse? They themselves 
<A NAME="319"></A>admit that I write amatory verse with sufficient sprightliness and skill. 
<A NAME="320"></A>The explanation is obvious to everyone; it is this: he who could not read 
<A NAME="321"></A>the letter which Pudentilla wrote in Greek altogether too refined for his 
<A NAME="322"></A>comprehension, found it easier to read this letter and set it off to greater 
<A NAME="323"></A>advantage because it was his own.
<A NAME="324"></A><BR><BR>One more point and I shall have said enough about the letters. 
<A NAME="325"></A>Pudentilla, after writing in jest and irony those words `Come then, while 
<A NAME="326"></A>I am yet in my senses,' sent for her sons and her daughter-in-law and lived 
<A NAME="327"></A>with them for about two months. I beg this most dutiful of sons to tell 
<A NAME="328"></A>us whether he then noticed his mother's alleged madness to have affected 
<A NAME="329"></A>for the worse either her words or her deeds. Let him deny that she showed 
<A NAME="330"></A>the utmost shrewdness in her examination of the accounts of the bailiffs, 
<A NAME="331"></A>grooms, and shepherds, that she earnestly warned his brother Pontianus 
<A NAME="332"></A>to be on his guard against the designs of Rufinus, that she rebuked him 
<A NAME="333"></A>severely for having freely published the letter she had sent him without 
<A NAME="334"></A>having read it honestly as it was written! Let him deny that, after what 
<A NAME="335"></A>I have just related to you, his mother married me in her country house, 
<A NAME="336"></A>as had been agreed some time previously!
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="337"></A><B>Part 88</B>

<A NAME="338"></A><BR><BR>The reason for our decision to be married by preference at her 
<A NAME="339"></A>country house not far from Oea was to avoid a fresh concourse of citizens 
<A NAME="340"></A>demanding largesse. It was but a short time before that Pudentilla had 
<A NAME="341"></A>distributed 50,000 sesterces to the people on the occasion of Pontianus' 
<A NAME="342"></A>marriage and this boy's assumption of the garb of manhood. We also wished 
<A NAME="343"></A>to avoid the frequent and wearisome dinner-parties which custom generally 
<A NAME="344"></A>imposes on newly-married couples. This is the whole reason, Aemilianus, 
<A NAME="345"></A>why our marriage contract was signed not in the town but at a country house 
<A NAME="346"></A>in the neighbourhood -- to avoid squandering another 50,000 sesterces and 
<A NAME="347"></A>to escape dining in your company or at your house. Is that 
<A NAME="348"></A>sufficient?
<A NAME="349"></A><BR><BR>I must say that I am surprised that you object so strongly to the 
<A NAME="350"></A>country house, considering that you spend most of your time in the country. 
<A NAME="351"></A>The Julian marriage-law nowhere contains a clause such as `no man shall 
<A NAME="352"></A>wed in a country house.' Indeed, if you would know the truth, it is of 
<A NAME="353"></A>far better omen for the expectation of offspring that one should marry 
<A NAME="354"></A>one's wife in a country house in preference to the town, on rich soil in 
<A NAME="355"></A>preference to barren ground, on the greensward of the meadow rather than 
<A NAME="356"></A>the pavement of the market-place. She that would be a mother should marry 
<A NAME="357"></A>in the very bosom of her mother, among the standing crops, on the fruitful 
<A NAME="358"></A>ploughland, or she should lie beneath the elm that weds the vine, on the 
<A NAME="359"></A>very lap of mother earth, among the springing herbage, the trailing vine-shoots 
<A NAME="360"></A>and the budding trees. I may add that the metaphor in the line so well 
<A NAME="361"></A>known in comedy
<A NAME="362"></A><BR><BR>that in the furrow children true be sown
<A NAME="363"></A><BR><BR>bears out this view most strongly. The ancient Romans also, such 
<A NAME="364"></A>as Quintius, Serranus and many others, were offered not only wives but 
<A NAME="365"></A>consulships and dictatorships in the open field. On such an abundant topic, 
<A NAME="366"></A>I will restrain myself for fear of gratifying you by my praise of country 
<A NAME="367"></A>life.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="368"></A><B>Part 89</B>

<A NAME="369"></A><BR><BR>As to Pudentilla's age, concerning which you lied so boldly as 
<A NAME="370"></A>to assert that she had married at the age of sixty, I will reply in a few 
<A NAME="371"></A>words. It is not necessary to speak at length in discussing a matter where 
<A NAME="372"></A>the truth is so obvious.
<A NAME="373"></A><BR><BR>Her father acknowledged her for his daughter in the usual fashion; 
<A NAME="374"></A>the documents in which he did so are preserved partly in the public record 
<A NAME="375"></A>office, partly in his house. Here they are before your very eyes. Please 
<A NAME="376"></A>hand the documents to Aemilianus. Let him examine the linen strip that 
<A NAME="377"></A>bears the seal; let him recognize the seal stamped upon it, let him read 
<A NAME="378"></A>the names of the consuls for the year, let him count up the years. He gave 
<A NAME="379"></A>her sixty years. Let him bring out the total at fifty-five, admitting that 
<A NAME="380"></A>he lied and gave her five too many. Nay, that is hardly enough. I will 
<A NAME="381"></A>deal yet more liberally with him. He gave Pudentilla such a number of years 
<A NAME="382"></A>that I will reward him by returning ten. Mezentius has been wandering with 
<A NAME="383"></A>Ulysses; let him at least prove that she is fifty.
<A NAME="384"></A><BR><BR>To cut the matter short, as I am dealing with an accuser who is 
<A NAME="385"></A>used to multiplying by four, I will multiply five years by four and subtract 
<A NAME="386"></A>twenty years at one fell swoop. I beg you, Maximus, to order the number 
<A NAME="387"></A>of consuls since her birth to be reckoned. If I am not mistaken, you will 
<A NAME="388"></A>find that Pudentilla has barely passed her fortieth year. The insolent 
<A NAME="389"></A>audacity of this falsehood! Twenty years' exile would be a worthy punishment 
<A NAME="390"></A>for such mendacity! Your fiction has added a good half to the sum, your 
<A NAME="391"></A>fabrication is one and a half times the size of the original. Had you said 
<A NAME="392"></A>thirty years when you ought to have said ten, it might have been supposed 
<A NAME="393"></A>that you had made a slip in the gesture used for your calculation, that 
<A NAME="394"></A>you had placed your fore-finger against the middle joint of your thumb, 
<A NAME="395"></A>when you should have made them form a circle. But whereas the gesture indicating 
<A NAME="396"></A>forty is the simplest of all such gestures, for you have merely to hold 
<A NAME="397"></A>out the palm of your hand -- you have increased the number by half as much 
<A NAME="398"></A>again. There is no room for an erroneous gesture; the only possible hypothesis 
<A NAME="399"></A>is that, believing Pudentilla to be thirty, you got your total by adding 
<A NAME="400"></A>up the number of consuls, two to each year.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="401"></A><B>Part 90</B>

<A NAME="402"></A><BR><BR>I have done with this. I come now to the very heart of the accusation, 
<A NAME="403"></A>to the actual motive for the use of magic. I ask Rufinus and Aemilianus 
<A NAME="404"></A>to answer me and tell me -- even assuming that I am the most consummate 
<A NAME="405"></A>magician -- what I had to gain by persuading Pudentilla to marry me by 
<A NAME="406"></A>means of my love philtres and my incantations.
<A NAME="407"></A><BR><BR>I am well aware that many persons, when accused of some crime or 
<A NAME="408"></A>other, even if it has been shown that there was some real motive for the 
<A NAME="409"></A>offence, have amply cleared themselves of guilt by this one line of defence, 
<A NAME="410"></A>that the whole record of their lives renders the suspicion of such a crime 
<A NAME="411"></A>incredible and that even though there may have been strong temptation to 
<A NAME="412"></A>sin, the mere fact of the existence of the temptation should not be counted 
<A NAME="413"></A>against them. We have no right to assume that everything that might have 
<A NAME="414"></A>been done actually has been done. Circumstances may alter; the one true 
<A NAME="415"></A>guide is a man's character; the one sure indication that a charge should 
<A NAME="416"></A>be rejected or believed is the fact that through all his life the accused 
<A NAME="417"></A>has set his face towards vice or virtue as the case may 
<A NAME="418"></A>be.
<A NAME="419"></A><BR><BR>I might with the utmost justice put in such a plea for myself, 
<A NAME="420"></A>but I waive my right in your favour, and shall think that I have made out 
<A NAME="421"></A>but a poor case for myself, if I merely clear myself of all your charges, 
<A NAME="422"></A>if I merely show that there exists not the slightest ground for suspecting 
<A NAME="423"></A>me of sorcery. Consider what confidence in my innocence and what contempt 
<A NAME="424"></A>of you is implied by my conduct. If you can discover one trivial reason 
<A NAME="425"></A>that might have led me to woo Pudentilla for the sake of some personal 
<A NAME="426"></A>advantage, if you can prove that I have made the very slightest profit 
<A NAME="427"></A>out of my marriage, I am ready to be any magician you please -- the great 
<A NAME="428"></A>Carmendas himself or Damigeron or Moses, or Jannes or Apollobex or Dardanus 
<A NAME="429"></A>himself or any sorcerer of note from the time of Zoroaster and Ostanes 
<A NAME="430"></A>till now.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="431"></A><B>Part 91</B>

<A NAME="432"></A><BR><BR>See, Maximus, what a disturbance they have raised, merely because 
<A NAME="433"></A>I have mentioned a few magicians by name. What am I to do with men so stupid 
<A NAME="434"></A>and uncivilized? Shall I proceed to prove to you that I have come across 
<A NAME="435"></A>these names and many more in the course of my study of distinguished authors 
<A NAME="436"></A>in the public libraries? Or shall I argue that the knowledge of the names 
<A NAME="437"></A>of sorcerers is one thing, participation in their art another, and that 
<A NAME="438"></A>it is not tantamount to confessing a crime to have one's brain well stored 
<A NAME="439"></A>with learning and a memory retentive of its erudition? Or shall I take 
<A NAME="440"></A>what is far the best course and, relying on your learning, Maximus, and 
<A NAME="441"></A>your perfect erudition, disdain to reply to the accusations of these stupid 
<A NAME="442"></A>and uncultivated fellows? Yes, that is what I will do. I will not care 
<A NAME="443"></A>a straw for what they may think. I will go on with the argument on which 
<A NAME="444"></A>I had entered and will show that I had no motive for seducing Pudentilla 
<A NAME="445"></A>into marriage by the use of love philtres. My accusers have gone out of 
<A NAME="446"></A>their way to make disparaging remarks both about her age and her appearance; 
<A NAME="447"></A>they have denounced me for desiring such a wife from motives of greed and 
<A NAME="448"></A>robbing her of her vast and magnificent dowry at the very outset of our 
<A NAME="449"></A>wedded life.
<A NAME="450"></A><BR><BR>I do not intend to weary you Maximus, with a long reply on these 
<A NAME="451"></A>points. There is no need for words from me, our deeds of settlement will 
<A NAME="452"></A>speak more eloquently than I can do. From them you will see that both in 
<A NAME="453"></A>my provision for the future and in my action at the time my conduct was 
<A NAME="454"></A>precisely the opposite of that which they have attributed to me, inferring 
<A NAME="455"></A>my rapacity from their own. You will see that Pudentilla's dowry was small, 
<A NAME="456"></A>considering her wealth, and was made over to me as a trust, not as a gift, 
<A NAME="457"></A>and moreover that the marriage only took place on this condition that if 
<A NAME="458"></A>my wife should die without leaving me any children, the dowry should go 
<A NAME="459"></A>to her sons Pontianus and Pudens, while if at her death she should leave 
<A NAME="460"></A>me one son or daughter, half of the dowry was to go to the offspring of 
<A NAME="461"></A>the second marriage, the remainder to the sons of the 
<A NAME="462"></A>first.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="463"></A><B>Part 92</B>

<A NAME="464"></A><BR><BR>This, as I say, I will prove from the actual deed of settlement. 
<A NAME="465"></A>It may be that Aemilianus will still refuse to believe that the total sum 
<A NAME="466"></A>recorded is only 30,000 sesterces, and that the reveNion of this sum is 
<A NAME="467"></A>given by the settlement to Pudentilla's sons. Take the deeds into your 
<A NAME="468"></A>own hands, give them to Rufinus who incited you to this accusation. Let 
<A NAME="469"></A>him read them, let him blush for his arrogant temper and his pretentious 
<A NAME="470"></A>beggary. He is poor and ill-clad and borrowed 400,000 sesterces to dower 
<A NAME="471"></A>his daughter, while Pudentilla, a woman of fortune, was content with 300,000, 
<A NAME="472"></A>and her husband, who has often refused the hand of the richest heiresses, 
<A NAME="473"></A>is also content with this trifling dowry, a mere nominal sum. He cares 
<A NAME="474"></A>for nothing save his wife and counts harmony with his spouse and great 
<A NAME="475"></A>love as his sole treasure, his only wealth.
<A NAME="476"></A><BR><BR>Who that had the least experience of life, would dare to pass any 
<A NAME="477"></A>censure if a widow of inconsiderable beauty and considerable age, being 
<A NAME="478"></A>desirous of marriage, had by the offer of a large dowry and easy conditions 
<A NAME="479"></A>invited a young man, who, whether as regards appearance, character or wealth, 
<A NAME="480"></A>was no despicable match, to become her husband? A beautiful maiden, even 
<A NAME="481"></A>though she is poor, is amply dowered. For she brings to her husband a fresh 
<A NAME="482"></A>untainted spirit, the charm of her beauty, the unblemished glory of her 
<A NAME="483"></A>prime. The very fact that she is a maiden is rightly and deservedly regarded 
<A NAME="484"></A>by all husbands as the strongest recommendation. For whatever else you 
<A NAME="485"></A>receive as your wife's dowry you can, when it pleases you and if you desire 
<A NAME="486"></A>to feel yourself under no further obligation, repay in full just as you 
<A NAME="487"></A>received it; you can count back the money, restore the slaves, leave the 
<A NAME="488"></A>howe, abandon the estates. Virginity only, once it has been given, can 
<A NAME="489"></A>never be repaid; it is the one portion of the dowry that remains irrevocably 
<A NAME="490"></A>with the husband.
<A NAME="491"></A><BR><BR>A widow on the other hand, if divorced, leaves you as she came. 
<A NAME="492"></A>She brings you nothing that she cannot ask back, she has been another's 
<A NAME="493"></A>and is certainly far from tractable to your wishes; she looks suspiciously 
<A NAME="494"></A>on her new home, while you regard her with suspicion because she has already 
<A NAME="495"></A>been parted from one husband: if it was by death she lost her husband, 
<A NAME="496"></A>the evil omen of her ill-starred union minimizes her attractions, while, 
<A NAME="497"></A>if she left him by divorce, she possesses one of two faults: either she 
<A NAME="498"></A>was so intolerable that she was divorced by her husband, or so insolent 
<A NAME="499"></A>as to divorce him. It is for reasons of this kind among others that widows 
<A NAME="500"></A>offer a larger dowry to attract suitors for their hands. Pudentilla would 
<A NAME="501"></A>have done the same had she not found a philosopher indifferent to her 
<A NAME="502"></A>dowry.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="503"></A><B>Part 93</B>

<A NAME="504"></A><BR><BR>Consider. If I had desired her from motives of avarice, what could 
<A NAME="505"></A>have been more profitable to me in my attempt to make myself master in 
<A NAME="506"></A>her house than the dissemination of strife between mother and sons, the 
<A NAME="507"></A>alienation of her children from her affections, so that I might have unfettered 
<A NAME="508"></A>and supreme control over her loneliness? Such would have been, would it 
<A NAME="509"></A>not, the action of the brigand you pretend me to be.
<A NAME="510"></A><BR><BR>But as a matter of fact I did all I could to promote, to restore 
<A NAME="511"></A>and foster quiet and harmony and family affection, and not only abstained 
<A NAME="512"></A>from sowing fresh feuds, but utterly extinguished those already in existence. 
<A NAME="513"></A>I urged my wife -- whose whole fortune according to my accusers I had by 
<A NAME="514"></A>this time devoured -- I urged her and finally persuaded her, when her sons 
<A NAME="515"></A>demanded back the money of which I spoke above, to pay over the whole sum 
<A NAME="516"></A>at once in the shape of farms, at a low valuation and at the price suggested 
<A NAME="517"></A>by themselves, and further to surrender from her own private property certain 
<A NAME="518"></A>exceedingly fertile lands, a large house richly decorated, a great quantity 
<A NAME="519"></A>of wheat, barley, wine and oil, and other fruits of the earth, together 
<A NAME="520"></A>with not less than four hundred slaves and a large number of valuable cattle. 
<A NAME="521"></A>Finally I persuaded her to abandon all claims on the portion she had given 
<A NAME="522"></A>them and to give them good hopes of one day coming into the rest of the 
<A NAME="523"></A>property. All these concessions I extorted from Pudentilla with difficulty 
<A NAME="524"></A>and against her will -- I have her leave to tell the whole story as it 
<A NAME="525"></A>happened -- I wrung them from her by my urgent entreaty, though she was 
<A NAME="526"></A>angry and reluctant. I reconciled the mother with her sons, and began my 
<A NAME="527"></A>career as a step-father by enriching my step-sons with a large sum of 
<A NAME="528"></A>money.

<A NAME="530"></A><BR><BR>All Oea was aware of this. Every one execrated Rufinus and extolled 
<A NAME="531"></A>mg conduct.
<A NAME="532"></A><BR><BR>Pontianus together with his very inferior brother had come to visit 
<A NAME="533"></A>us, before his mother had completed her donation. He fell at our feet and 
<A NAME="534"></A>implored us to forgive and forget all his past offences; he wept, kissed 
<A NAME="535"></A>our hands and expressed his penitence for listening to Rufinus and others 
<A NAME="536"></A>like him. He also most humbly begged me to make his excuses to the most 
<A NAME="537"></A>honourable Lollianus Avitus to whom I had recommended him not long before 
<A NAME="538"></A>when he was beginning the study of oratory. He had discovered that I had 
<A NAME="539"></A>written to Avitus a few days previously a full account of all that had 
<A NAME="540"></A>happened. I granted him this request also and gave him a letter with which 
<A NAME="541"></A>he set off to Carthage, where Lollianus Avitus, the term of his proconsulate 
<A NAME="542"></A>having neariy expired, was awaiting your arrival, Maximus. After reading 
<A NAME="543"></A>my letters he congratulated Pontianus with the exquisite courtesy which 
<A NAME="544"></A>always characterizes him for having so soon rectified his error and entrusted 
<A NAME="545"></A>him with a reply. Ah! what learning! what wit! what grace and charm dwelt 
<A NAME="546"></A>in that reply! Only a `good man and an orator' could have written 
<A NAME="547"></A>it.
<A NAME="548"></A><BR><BR>I know, Maximus, that you will readily give a hearing to this letter. 
<A NAME="549"></A>Indeed, if it is to be read, I will recite it myself. Give me Avitus' letter. 
<A NAME="550"></A>That I should have received it has always flattered me. Today it shall 
<A NAME="551"></A>do more than flatter, it shall save me! You may let the water-clock continue, 
<A NAME="552"></A>for I would gladly read and re-read the letter of that excellent man to 
<A NAME="553"></A>the third and fourth time at the cost of any amount of the time allowed 
<A NAME="554"></A>me.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="555"></A><B>Part 95</B>

<A NAME="556"></A><BR><BR>I know that after reading this letter I should bring my speech 
<A NAME="557"></A>to a close. For what ampler commendation, what purer testimony could I 
<A NAME="558"></A>produce in my support, what more eloquent advocacy? I have in the course 
<A NAME="559"></A>of my life listened with rapt attention to many eloquent Romans, but never 
<A NAME="560"></A>have I admired any so much as Avitus. There is in my opinion no one living 
<A NAME="561"></A>of any attainments or promise in oratory who would not far sooner be Avitus, 
<A NAME="562"></A>if he compares him with himself impartially and without envy. For practically 
<A NAME="563"></A>all the different excellencies of oratory are united in him. Whatever speech 
<A NAME="564"></A>Avitus composes will be found so absolutely perfect and complete in all 
<A NAME="565"></A>respects that it would satisfy Cato by its dignity, Laelius with its smoothness, 
<A NAME="566"></A>Gracchus with its energy, Caesar with its warmth, Hortensius with its arrangement, 
<A NAME="567"></A>Calvus with its point, Sallust with its economy and Cicero with its wealth 
<A NAME="568"></A>of rhetoric. In fact, not to go through all his merits, if you were to 
<A NAME="569"></A>hear Avitus, you would wish nothing added, withdrawn or altered of anything 
<A NAME="570"></A>that he says.
<A NAME="571"></A><BR><BR>I see, Maximus, with what pleasure you listen to the recital of 
<A NAME="572"></A>the virtues which you recognize your friend Avitus to possess. Your courtesy 
<A NAME="573"></A>invited me to say a few words about him. But I will not trespass on your 
<A NAME="574"></A>kindness so far as to permit myself to commence a discourse on his extraordinary 
<A NAME="575"></A>virtues at this period of the case. It is wearing to its end and my powers 
<A NAME="576"></A>are almost exhausted. I will rather reserve the praise of Avitus' virtues 
<A NAME="577"></A>for some day when my time is free and my powers unimpaired.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="578"></A><B>Part 96</B>

<A NAME="579"></A><BR><BR>Now, I grieve to say, it is my duty to turn from the description 
<A NAME="580"></A>of so great a man to discuss these pestilent fellows here. Do you dare 
<A NAME="581"></A>then, Aemilianus, to match yourself against Avitus? Will you attack with 
<A NAME="582"></A>accusations of magic and the black art him whom Avitus describes as a good 
<A NAME="583"></A>man, and whose disposition he praises so warmly in his letter? Or do you 
<A NAME="584"></A>have greater reason to be vexed at my forcing my way into Pudentilla's 
<A NAME="585"></A>house and pillaging her goods than Pontianus would have had, Pontianus, 
<A NAME="586"></A>who not only in my presence but even before Avitus in my absence, made 
<A NAME="587"></A>amends for the strife of a few days that had sprung up between us at your 
<A NAME="588"></A>instigation, and expressed his gratitude to me in the presence of so great 
<A NAME="589"></A>a man?
<A NAME="590"></A><BR><BR>Suppose I had read a report of what took place in Avitus' presence 
<A NAME="591"></A>instead of reading merely his letter. What is there in the whole affair 
<A NAME="592"></A>that could give you or anyone else a handle for accusing me? Pontianus 
<A NAME="593"></A>himself considered himself in my debt for the money given him by his mother; 
<A NAME="594"></A>Pontianus rejoiced with the utmost sincerity in his good fortune in having 
<A NAME="595"></A>me for his step-father. Ah! would that he had returned from Carthage safe 
<A NAME="596"></A>and sound! Or since it was not fated that that should be, would that you, 
<A NAME="597"></A>Rufinus, had not poisoned his judgement at the last! What gratitude he 
<A NAME="598"></A>would have expressed to me either personally or in his will! However, as 
<A NAME="599"></A>things are, I beg you, Maximus, -- it will not take long -- to allow the 
<A NAME="600"></A>reading of these letters full of expressions of respect and affection for 
<A NAME="601"></A>myself, which he sent me, some of them from Carthage, some as he drew near 
<A NAME="602"></A>on his homeward journey, some written while he still enjoyed his health, 
<A NAME="603"></A>and some when the sickness was already upon him. Thus his brother, my accuser, 
<A NAME="604"></A>will realize how in everything he is running a Minerva's course with his 
<A NAME="605"></A>brother, a man of blessed memory.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="606"></A><B>Part 97</B>

<A NAME="607"></A><BR><BR>Did you hear the phrases which your brother Pontianus used in speaking 
<A NAME="608"></A>of me? He called me his father, his master, his instructor not only on 
<A NAME="609"></A>various occasions in his lifetime but actually on his deathbed. I might 
<A NAME="610"></A>follow this by producing similar letters from you, if I thought that the 
<A NAME="611"></A>delay thus caused would be worth while. But I should prefer to produce 
<A NAME="612"></A>your brother's recent will, unfinished though it may be, in which he made 
<A NAME="613"></A>most dutiful and respectful mention of myself. But Rufinus never allowed 
<A NAME="614"></A>this will to be drawn up or completed owing to his chagrin at the loss 
<A NAME="615"></A>of the inheritance which he had regarded in the light of a rich payment 
<A NAME="616"></A>for his daughter's embraces during the few months in which he was Pontianus' 
<A NAME="617"></A>father-in-law. He had further consulted certain Chaldean soothsayers as 
<A NAME="618"></A>to what profit his daughter, whom he regarded in the light of an investment, 
<A NAME="619"></A>would bring him in. They, I am told, prophesied truly -- would they had 
<A NAME="620"></A>not -- that her first husband would die in a few months. The rest of the 
<A NAME="621"></A>prophecy dealing with the inheritance was as usual fabricated to suit the 
<A NAME="622"></A>debires of their client.
<A NAME="623"></A><BR><BR>But Rufinus gaped for his prey in vain like a wild beast that has 
<A NAME="624"></A>gone blind. For Pontianus not only did not leave Rufinus' daughter as his 
<A NAME="625"></A>heir -- he had discovered her evil character -- but he did not even make 
<A NAME="626"></A>her a respectable legacy. He left her by way of insult linen to the value 
<A NAME="627"></A>of 200 denarii, to show that he had not forgotten or ignored her, but that 
<A NAME="628"></A>he set this value on her as an expression of his resentment. As his heirs 
<A NAME="629"></A>-- in this just as in the former will which has been read aloud -- he appointed 
<A NAME="630"></A>his mother and his brother, against whom, mere boy as he is, Rufinus is, 
<A NAME="631"></A>as you see, bringing his old artillery into play: I refer to his daughter. 
<A NAME="632"></A>He thrusts her upon his embraces although she is considerably his elder 
<A NAME="633"></A>and but a brief while ago was his brother's wife.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="634"></A><B>Part 98</B>

<A NAME="635"></A><BR><BR>Pudens was so captivated and possessed by the charms of that harlot 
<A NAME="636"></A>and by the beguiling words of the pander, her father, that the moment his 
<A NAME="637"></A>brother had breathed his last, he left his mother and migrated to his uncle's 
<A NAME="638"></A>house. The design was to facilitate the carrying out of the schemes already 
<A NAME="639"></A>afoot by removing him from our influence. For Aemilianus is backing Rufinus 
<A NAME="640"></A>and desires his success. Ah! Thank you! You rightly remind me that this 
<A NAME="641"></A>excellent uncle has hopes of his own mixed up in this affair, for he knows 
<A NAME="642"></A>that if this boy dies intestate he will be his heir-at-law, whatever he 
<A NAME="643"></A>may be in point of equity. I wish I had not let this slip. I am a man of 
<A NAME="644"></A>great self-control and it is not my way to blurt out openly the silent 
<A NAME="645"></A>suspicions that must have occurred to every one. You did wrong in suggesting 
<A NAME="646"></A>this point to me!
<A NAME="647"></A><BR><BR>But to be frank, if you will have the truth, many have been wondering 
<A NAME="648"></A>at the sudden affection which you, Aemilianus, have begun to show for this 
<A NAME="649"></A>boy since the death of his brother Pontianus, whereas formerly you were 
<A NAME="650"></A>such a stranger to him that frequently, even when you met him, you failed 
<A NAME="651"></A>to recognize the face of your brother's son. But now you show yourself 
<A NAME="652"></A>so patient towards him, you so spoil him by your indulgence and grant his 
<A NAME="653"></A>every whim to such an extent that your conduct makes the more suspicious 
<A NAME="654"></A>think their suspicions well grounded. You took him from us a mere boy and 
<A NAME="655"></A>straightway gave him the garb of manhood. While he was under our guardianship, 
<A NAME="656"></A>he used to go to school: now he has bidden a long farewell to study and 
<A NAME="657"></A>betaken himself to the delights of the tavern. He despises serious friends, 
<A NAME="658"></A>and, boy as he is, spends his tender years in revelling with the most abandoned 
<A NAME="659"></A>youths among harlots and wine-cups. He rules your house, orders your slaves, 
<A NAME="660"></A>directs your banquets. He is frequently seen in&lt;/
<A NAME="661"></A><BR><BR>I&gt; the gladiatorial school and there -- as a boy of position 
<A NAME="662"></A>should! -- he learns from the keeper of the school the names of the gladiators, 
<A NAME="663"></A>the fights they have fought, the wounds they have received. He never speaks 
<A NAME="664"></A>any language save Punic, and though he may occasionally use a Greek word 
<A NAME="665"></A>picked up from his mother, he neither will nor can speak Latin. You heard, 
<A NAME="666"></A>Maximus, a little while ago, you heard my step-son -- oh! the shame of 
<A NAME="667"></A>it! -- the brother of that eloquent young fellow Pontianus, hardly able 
<A NAME="668"></A>to stammer out single syllables, when you asked him whether his mother 
<A NAME="669"></A>had given himself and his brother the gifts which, as I told you just now, 
<A NAME="670"></A>she actually gave them with my hearty support.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="671"></A><B>Part 99</B>

<A NAME="672"></A><BR><BR>I call you, therefore, Claudius Maximus, and you, gentlemen, his 
<A NAME="673"></A>assessors, and you that with me stand before this tribunal, to bear witness 
<A NAME="674"></A>that this boy's disgraceful falling away in morals is due to his uncle 
<A NAME="675"></A>here and that candidate for the privilege of becoming his father-in-law, 
<A NAME="676"></A>and that I shall henceforth count it a blessing that such a step-son has 
<A NAME="677"></A>lifted the burden of superintending him from my shoulders, and that from 
<A NAME="678"></A>this day forth I will never intercede for him with his 
<A NAME="679"></A>mother.
<A NAME="680"></A><BR><BR>For recently -- I had almost forgotten to mention it -- when Pudentilla, 
<A NAME="681"></A>who had fallen ill after the death of her son Pontianus, was writing her 
<A NAME="682"></A>will, I had a prolonged struggle to prevent her disinheriting this boy 
<A NAME="683"></A>on account of the outrageous insult and injury he had inflicted on her. 
<A NAME="684"></A>I prayed her with the utmost earnestness to erase that most important clause, 
<A NAME="685"></A>which, I can assure you, she had already written, every word of it! Finally, 
<A NAME="686"></A>I even threatened to leave her, if she refused to accede to my request, 
<A NAME="687"></A>and begged her to grant me this boon, to conquer her wicked son by kindness, 
<A NAME="688"></A>and to save me from all the ill feeling which her action would create. 
<A NAME="689"></A>I did not desist till she complied.
<A NAME="690"></A><BR><BR>I regret that I should have taken away this point of concern from 
<A NAME="691"></A>Aemilianus and showed him such an unexpected thing. Look, Maximus, see 
<A NAME="692"></A>how confused he is at hearing this, see how he casts his eyes upon the 
<A NAME="693"></A>ground. He had not unnaturally expected something very different. He knew 
<A NAME="694"></A>that my wife was angry with her son on account of his insolent behaviour 
<A NAME="695"></A>and that she returned my devotion. He had reason also for fear in regard 
<A NAME="696"></A>to myself; for anyone else, even if like myself he had been above coveting 
<A NAME="697"></A>the inheritance, would gladly have seen so undutiful a step-son punished. 
<A NAME="698"></A>It was this anxiety above all others that spurred them on to accuse me. 
<A NAME="699"></A>Their own avarice led them falsely to conjecture that the whole inheritance 
<A NAME="700"></A>had been left to me. As far as the past is concerned, I will dispel your 
<A NAME="701"></A>fears on that point. I was proof against the temptation both of enriching 
<A NAME="702"></A>myself and of revenging myself. I -- a step-father, mind you -- contended 
<A NAME="703"></A>for my wicked step-son with his mother, as a father might contend against 
<A NAME="704"></A>a stepmother in the interests of a virtuous son; nor did I rest satisfied 
<A NAME="705"></A>till, with a perfectly extravagant sense of fairness, I had restrained 
<A NAME="706"></A>my good wife's lavish generosity towards myself.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="707"></A><B>Part 100</B>

<A NAME="708"></A><BR><BR>Give me the will which was made in the interests of so unfilial 
<A NAME="709"></A>a son by his mother. Each word of it was preceded by an entreaty from myself, 
<A NAME="710"></A>whom my accusers speak of as a mere robber. Order the tablets to be broken 
<A NAME="711"></A>open, Maximus. You will find that her son is the heir, that I get nothing 
<A NAME="712"></A>save some trifling complimentary legacy inserted to avoid the non-appearance 
<A NAME="713"></A>of my name, the husband's name, mark you, in my wife's will, supposing 
<A NAME="714"></A>she succumbed to any of the ills to which this flesh is heir. Take up your 
<A NAME="715"></A>mother's will. You are right, in one respect it is undutiful. She excludes 
<A NAME="716"></A>her devoted husband from the inheritance in favour of her most unfilial 
<A NAME="717"></A>son? Nay, it is not her son to whom she leaves her fortune; she leaves 
<A NAME="718"></A>it rather to the greedy Aemilianus and the matchmaking Rufinus and that 
<A NAME="719"></A>drunken gang, that hang about you and prey upon you.
<A NAME="720"></A><BR><BR>Take it, o best of sons! Lay aside your mother's love-letters for 
<A NAME="721"></A>a while and read her will instead. If she ever wrote anything while not 
<A NAME="722"></A>in her right mind, you will find it here, nor will you have to go far to 
<A NAME="723"></A>find it. `Let Sicinius Pudens, my son, be my heir.' I admit it! he who 
<A NAME="724"></A>reads this, will think it insanity. Is this same son your heir, who at 
<A NAME="725"></A>his own brother's funeral attempted with the help of a gang of the most 
<A NAME="726"></A>abandoned youths to shut you out of the house which you yourself had given 
<A NAME="727"></A>him, who is so deeply and bitterly incensed to find that his brother left 
<A NAME="728"></A>you co-heir with himself, who hastened to desert you when you were plunged 
<A NAME="729"></A>in grief and mourning, and fled from your bosom to Aemilianus and Rufinus, 
<A NAME="730"></A>who afterwards uttered many insults against you to your face, and manufactured 
<A NAME="731"></A>others with the help of his uncle, who has dragged your name through the 
<A NAME="732"></A>law-courts, has attempted by using your own letters publicly to besmirch 
<A NAME="733"></A>your fair fame, and has accused upon a capital charge the husband of your 
<A NAME="734"></A>choice, with whom, as Pudens himself objected, you were madly in 
<A NAME="735"></A>love!
<A NAME="736"></A><BR><BR>Open the will, my good boy, open it, I beg you. You will find it 
<A NAME="737"></A>easier then to prove your mother's insanity. Why do you draw back? Why 
<A NAME="738"></A>do you refuse to look at it, now that you are free from all anxiety about 
<A NAME="739"></A>the inheritance of your mother's fortune?
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="740"></A><B>Part 101</B>

<A NAME="741"></A><BR><BR>He may do as he likes, Maximus, but for my part I cast these tablets 
<A NAME="742"></A>at your feet and call you to witness that henceforth I shall show greater 
<A NAME="743"></A>indifference as to what Pudentilla may write in her will. He may approach 
<A NAME="744"></A>his mother himself for the future; he has made it impossible for me to 
<A NAME="745"></A>plead for him again. He is now a man and his own master; henceforth let 
<A NAME="746"></A>him himself dictate to his mother the terms of an unpalatable will, himself 
<A NAME="747"></A>smooth away her anger. He who can plead in court, will be able to plead 
<A NAME="748"></A>with his mother.
<A NAME="749"></A><BR><BR>I am more than satisfied not only to have refuted the miscellaneous 
<A NAME="750"></A>accusations brought against myself, but also to have utterly swept away 
<A NAME="751"></A>the hateful charge on which the whole trial is based, the charge of having 
<A NAME="752"></A>attempted to secure the inheritance for myself.
<A NAME="753"></A><BR><BR>I will bring one final proof to show the falsity of that last charge 
<A NAME="754"></A>before I bring my speech to a close. I wish to pass nothing over in silence. 
<A NAME="755"></A>You asserted that I bought a most excellent farm in my own name, but with 
<A NAME="756"></A>a large sum of money which belonged to my wife. I say that a tiny property 
<A NAME="757"></A>was bought for 60,000 sesterces, and bought not by me but by Pudentilla 
<A NAME="758"></A>in her own name, that Pudentilla's name is in the deed of sale, and that 
<A NAME="759"></A>the taxes paid on the land are paid in the name of Pudentilla. The honourable 
<A NAME="760"></A>Coninus Celer, the state treasurer to whom the tax is paid, is here in 
<A NAME="761"></A>court. Cassius Longinus also is present, my wife's guardian and trustee, 
<A NAME="762"></A>a man of the loftiest and most irreproachable character. I cannot speak 
<A NAME="763"></A>of him save with the deepest respect. Ask him, Maximus, what was the purchase 
<A NAME="764"></A>which he authorized, and what was the trifling sum for which this wealthy 
<A NAME="765"></A>lady bought her little estate.
<A NAME="766"></A><BR><BR>Is it as I said? Is my name ever mentioned in the deed of sale? 
<A NAME="767"></A>Is the price paid for this trifling property such as should excite any 
<A NAME="768"></A>prejudice against me, or did my wife give me even so much as this small 
<A NAME="769"></A>gift?
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="770"></A><B>Part 102</B>

<A NAME="771"></A><BR><BR>What is there left, Aemilianus, that in your opinion I have failed 
<A NAME="772"></A>to refute? What had I to gain by my magic that should lead me to attempt 
<A NAME="773"></A>to win Pudentilla by love-philtres? What had I to gain from her? A small 
<A NAME="774"></A>dowry instead of a large one? Truly my incantations were miraculous. That 
<A NAME="775"></A>she should refund her dowry to her sons rather than leave it in my possession? 
<A NAME="776"></A>What magic can surpass this? That she should at my exhortation present 
<A NAME="777"></A>the bulk of her property to her sons and leave me nothing, although before 
<A NAME="778"></A>her marriage with myself she had shown them no special generosity? What 
<A NAME="779"></A>a criminal we of love-philtres! Or perhaps I had better call it a generous 
<A NAME="780"></A>action which has not received its deserts! By her will, which she drew 
<A NAME="781"></A>up in a fit of violent irritation against her son, she leaves as her heir 
<A NAME="782"></A>that same son with whom she had quarrelled, rather than myself to whom 
<A NAME="783"></A>she was devoted! For all my incantations it was only with difficulty that 
<A NAME="784"></A>I persuaded her to this.
<A NAME="785"></A><BR><BR>Suppose that you were pleading your case, not before Claudius Maximus, 
<A NAME="786"></A>a man of the utmost fairness and unswerving justice, but before a judge 
<A NAME="787"></A>of depraved morals and of ferocious temper, one in fact who naturally inclined 
<A NAME="788"></A>to the side of the accuser and was only too ready to condemn the accused! 
<A NAME="789"></A>Give him some hint to follow! Give him even the slightest reasonable opportunity 
<A NAME="790"></A>for declaring in your favour! At least invent something, devise some suitable 
<A NAME="791"></A>reply to questions such as have been put to you.
<A NAME="792"></A><BR><BR>Nay, since every action must necessarily have some motive, answer 
<A NAME="793"></A>me this, you who say that Apuleius tried to influence Pudentilla's heart 
<A NAME="794"></A>by magical charms, answer me this! What did he seek to get from her by 
<A NAME="795"></A>so doing? Was he in love with her beauty? You say not! Did he covet her 
<A NAME="796"></A>wealth? The evidence of the marriage settlement denies it, the evidence 
<A NAME="797"></A>of the deed of gift denies it, the evidence of the will denies it! It shows 
<A NAME="798"></A>not only that I did not court the generosity of my wife, but that I even 
<A NAME="799"></A>repulsed it with some severity. What other motive can you allege? Why are 
<A NAME="800"></A>you struck dumb? Why this silence? What has become of that ferocious utterance 
<A NAME="801"></A>with which you opened the indictment, couched in the name of my step-son? 
<A NAME="802"></A>`This is the man, most excellent Maximus, whom I have resolved to indict 
<A NAME="803"></A>before you.'
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="804"></A><B>Part 103</B>

<A NAME="805"></A><BR><BR>Why did you not add `He whom I indict is my teacher, my step-father, 
<A NAME="806"></A>my mediator'? But how did you proceed? `He is guilty of the most palpable 
<A NAME="807"></A>and numerous sorceries.' Produce one of these many sorceries or at least 
<A NAME="808"></A>some doubtful instance from those which you style so 
<A NAME="809"></A>palpable.
<A NAME="810"></A><BR><BR>Nay, see whether I cannot reply to your various charges with two 
<A NAME="811"></A>words to each. `You clean your teeth.' Excusable cleanliness. `You look 
<A NAME="812"></A>into mirrors.' Philosophers should. `You write verse.' 'Tis permitted. 
<A NAME="813"></A>`You examine fish.' Following Aristotle. `You worship a piece of wood.' 
<A NAME="814"></A>So Plato. `You marry a wife.' Obeying law. `She is older than you.' Nothing 
<A NAME="815"></A>commoner. `You married for money.' Take the marriage-settlement, remember 
<A NAME="816"></A>the deed of gift, read the will!
<A NAME="817"></A><BR><BR>If I have rebutted all their charges, word by word, if I have refuted 
<A NAME="818"></A>all their slanders, if I am beyond reproach, not only as regards their 
<A NAME="819"></A>accusations but also as regards their vulgar abuse, if I have done nothing 
<A NAME="820"></A>to impair the honour of philosophy, which is dearer to me than my own safety, 
<A NAME="821"></A>but on the contrary have smitten my adversary hip and thigh and vanquished 
<A NAME="822"></A>him at all points, if all my contentions are true, I can await your estimate 
<A NAME="823"></A>of my character with the same confidence with which I await the exercise 
<A NAME="824"></A>of your power; for I regard it as less serious and less terrible to be 
<A NAME="825"></A>condemned by the proconsul than to incur the disapproval of so good and 
<A NAME="826"></A>so perfect a man.
