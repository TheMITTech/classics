<A NAME="10"></A><B>Chapter I</B>
<A NAME="11"></A><BR><BR><B>The State of Greece from the earliest Times to the</B> <B>Commencement 
<A NAME="12"></A>of the Peloponnesian War</B>
<A NAME="13"></A><BR><BR>Thucydides, an Athenian, wrote the history of the war between the 
<A NAME="14"></A>Peloponnesians and the Athenians, beginning at the moment that it broke 
<A NAME="15"></A>out, and believing that it would be a great war and more worthy of relation 
<A NAME="16"></A>than any that had preceded it. This belief was not without its grounds. 
<A NAME="17"></A>The preparations of both the combatants were in every department in the 
<A NAME="18"></A>last state of perfection; and he could see the rest of the Hellenic race 
<A NAME="19"></A>taking sides in the quarrel; those who delayed doing so at once having 
<A NAME="20"></A>it in contemplation. Indeed this was the greatest movement yet known in 
<A NAME="21"></A>history, not only of the Hellenes, but of a large part of the barbarian 
<A NAME="22"></A>world- I had almost said of mankind. For though the events of remote antiquity, 
<A NAME="23"></A>and even those that more immediately preceded the war, could not from lapse 
<A NAME="24"></A>of time be clearly ascertained, yet the evidences which an inquiry carried 
<A NAME="25"></A>as far back as was practicable leads me to trust, all point to the conclusion 
<A NAME="26"></A>that there was nothing on a great scale, either in war or in other 
<A NAME="27"></A>matters.
<A NAME="28"></A><BR><BR>For instance, it is evident that the country now called Hellas 
<A NAME="29"></A>had in ancient times no settled population; on the contrary, migrations 
<A NAME="30"></A>were of frequent occurrence, the several tribes readily abandoning their 
<A NAME="31"></A>homes under the pressure of superior numbers. Without commerce, without 
<A NAME="32"></A>freedom of communication either by land or sea, cultivating no more of 
<A NAME="33"></A>their territory than the exigencies of life required, destitute of capital, 
<A NAME="34"></A>never planting their land (for they could not tell when an invader might 
<A NAME="35"></A>not come and take it all away, and when he did come they had no walls to 
<A NAME="36"></A>stop him), thinking that the necessities of daily sustenance could be supplied 
<A NAME="37"></A>at one place as well as another, they cared little for shifting their habitation, 
<A NAME="38"></A>and consequently neither built large cities nor attained to any other form 
<A NAME="39"></A>of greatness. The richest soils were always most subject to this change 
<A NAME="40"></A>of masters; such as the district now called Thessaly, Boeotia, most of 
<A NAME="41"></A>the Peloponnese, Arcadia excepted, and the most fertile parts of the rest 
<A NAME="42"></A>of Hellas. The goodness of the land favoured the aggrandizement of particular 
<A NAME="43"></A>individuals, and thus created faction which proved a fertile source of 
<A NAME="44"></A>ruin. It also invited invasion. Accordingly Attica, from the poverty of 
<A NAME="45"></A>its soil enjoying from a very remote period freedom from faction, never 
<A NAME="46"></A>changed its inhabitants. And here is no inconsiderable exemplification 
<A NAME="47"></A>of my assertion that the migrations were the cause of there being no correspondent 
<A NAME="48"></A>growth in other parts. The most powerful victims of war or faction from 
<A NAME="49"></A>the rest of Hellas took refuge with the Athenians as a safe retreat; and 
<A NAME="50"></A>at an early period, becoming naturalized, swelled the already large population 
<A NAME="51"></A>of the city to such a height that Attica became at last too small to hold 
<A NAME="52"></A>them, and they had to send out colonies to Ionia.
<A NAME="53"></A><BR><BR>There is also another circumstance that contributes not a little 
<A NAME="54"></A>to my conviction of the weakness of ancient times. Before the Trojan war 
<A NAME="55"></A>there is no indication of any common action in Hellas, nor indeed of the 
<A NAME="56"></A>universal prevalence of the name; on the contrary, before the time of Hellen, 
<A NAME="57"></A>son of Deucalion, no such appellation existed, but the country went by 
<A NAME="58"></A>the names of the different tribes, in particular of the Pelasgian. It was 
<A NAME="59"></A>not till Hellen and his sons grew strong in Phthiotis, and were invited 
<A NAME="60"></A>as allies into the other cities, that one by one they gradually acquired 
<A NAME="61"></A>from the connection the name of Hellenes; though a long time elapsed before 
<A NAME="62"></A>that name could fasten itself upon all. The best proof of this is furnished 
<A NAME="63"></A>by Homer. Born long after the Trojan War, he nowhere calls all of them 
<A NAME="64"></A>by that name, nor indeed any of them except the followers of Achilles from 
<A NAME="65"></A>Phthiotis, who were the original Hellenes: in his poems they are called 
<A NAME="66"></A>Danaans, Argives, and Achaeans. He does not even use the term barbarian, 
<A NAME="67"></A>probably because the Hellenes had not yet been marked off from the rest 
<A NAME="68"></A>of the world by one distinctive appellation. It appears therefore that 
<A NAME="69"></A>the several Hellenic communities, comprising not only those who first acquired 
<A NAME="70"></A>the name, city by city, as they came to understand each other, but also 
<A NAME="71"></A>those who assumed it afterwards as the name of the whole people, were before 
<A NAME="72"></A>the Trojan war prevented by their want of strength and the absence of mutual 
<A NAME="73"></A>intercourse from displaying any collective action.
<A NAME="74"></A><BR><BR>Indeed, they could not unite for this expedition till they had 
<A NAME="75"></A>gained increased familiarity with the sea. And the first person known to 
<A NAME="76"></A>us by tradition as having established a navy is Minos. He made himself 
<A NAME="77"></A>master of what is now called the Hellenic sea, and ruled over the Cyclades, 
<A NAME="78"></A>into most of which he sent the first colonies, expelling the Carians and 
<A NAME="79"></A>appointing his own sons governors; and thus did his best to put down piracy 
<A NAME="80"></A>in those waters, a necessary step to secure the revenues for his own 
<A NAME="81"></A>use.
<A NAME="82"></A><BR><BR>For in early times the Hellenes and the barbarians of the coast 
<A NAME="83"></A>and islands, as communication by sea became more common, were tempted to 
<A NAME="84"></A>turn pirates, under the conduct of their most powerful men; the motives 
<A NAME="85"></A>being to serve their own cupidity and to support the needy. They would 
<A NAME="86"></A>fall upon a town unprotected by walls, and consisting of a mere collection 
<A NAME="87"></A>of villages, and would plunder it; indeed, this came to be the main source 
<A NAME="88"></A>of their livelihood, no disgrace being yet attached to such an achievement, 
<A NAME="89"></A>but even some glory. An illustration of this is furnished by the honour 
<A NAME="90"></A>with which some of the inhabitants of the continent still regard a successful 
<A NAME="91"></A>marauder, and by the question we find the old poets everywhere representing 
<A NAME="92"></A>the people as asking of voyagers- "Are they pirates?"- as if those who 
<A NAME="93"></A>are asked the question would have no idea of disclaiming the imputation, 
<A NAME="94"></A>or their interrogators of reproaching them for it. The same rapine prevailed 
<A NAME="95"></A>also by land.
<A NAME="96"></A><BR><BR>And even at the present day many of Hellas still follow the old 
<A NAME="97"></A>fashion, the Ozolian Locrians for instance, the Aetolians, the Acarnanians, 
<A NAME="98"></A>and that region of the continent; and the custom of carrying arms is still 
<A NAME="99"></A>kept up among these continentals, from the old piratical habits. The whole 
<A NAME="100"></A>of Hellas used once to carry arms, their habitations being unprotected 
<A NAME="101"></A>and their communication with each other unsafe; indeed, to wear arms was 
<A NAME="102"></A>as much a part of everyday life with them as with the barbarians. And the 
<A NAME="103"></A>fact that the people in these parts of Hellas are still living in the old 
<A NAME="104"></A>way points to a time when the same mode of life was once equally common 
<A NAME="105"></A>to all. The Athenians were the first to lay aside their weapons, and to 
<A NAME="106"></A>adopt an easier and more luxurious mode of life; indeed, it is only lately 
<A NAME="107"></A>that their rich old men left off the luxury of wearing undergarments of 
<A NAME="108"></A>linen, and fastening a knot of their hair with a tie of golden grasshoppers, 
<A NAME="109"></A>a fashion which spread to their Ionian kindred and long prevailed among 
<A NAME="110"></A>the old men there. On the contrary, a modest style of dressing, more in 
<A NAME="111"></A>conformity with modern ideas, was first adopted by the Lacedaemonians, 
<A NAME="112"></A>the rich doing their best to assimilate their way of life to that of the 
<A NAME="113"></A>common people. They also set the example of contending naked, publicly 
<A NAME="114"></A>stripping and anointing themselves with oil in their gymnastic exercises. 
<A NAME="115"></A>Formerly, even in the Olympic contests, the athletes who contended wore 
<A NAME="116"></A>belts across their middles; and it is but a few years since that the practice 
<A NAME="117"></A>ceased. To this day among some of the barbarians, especially in Asia, when 
<A NAME="118"></A>prizes for boxing and wrestling are offered, belts are worn by the combatants. 
<A NAME="119"></A>And there are many other points in which a likeness might be shown between 
<A NAME="120"></A>the life of the Hellenic world of old and the barbarian of 
<A NAME="121"></A>to-day.
<A NAME="122"></A><BR><BR>With respect to their towns, later on, at an era of increased facilities 
<A NAME="123"></A>of navigation and a greater supply of capital, we find the shores becoming 
<A NAME="124"></A>the site of walled towns, and the isthmuses being occupied for the purposes 
<A NAME="125"></A>of commerce and defence against a neighbour. But the old towns, on account 
<A NAME="126"></A>of the great prevalence of piracy, were built away from the sea, whether 
<A NAME="127"></A>on the islands or the continent, and still remain in their old sites. For 
<A NAME="128"></A>the pirates used to plunder one another, and indeed all coast populations, 
<A NAME="129"></A>whether seafaring or not.
<A NAME="130"></A><BR><BR>The islanders, too, were great pirates. These islanders were Carians 
<A NAME="131"></A>and Phoenicians, by whom most of the islands were colonized, as was proved 
<A NAME="132"></A>by the following fact. During the purification of Delos by Athens in this 
<A NAME="133"></A>war all the graves in the island were taken up, and it was found that above 
<A NAME="134"></A>half their inmates were Carians: they were identified by the fashion of 
<A NAME="135"></A>the arms buried with them, and by the method of interment, which was the 
<A NAME="136"></A>same as the Carians still follow. But as soon as Minos had formed his navy, 
<A NAME="137"></A>communication by sea became easier, as he colonized most of the islands, 
<A NAME="138"></A>and thus expelled the malefactors. The coast population now began to apply 
<A NAME="139"></A>themselves more closely to the acquisition of wealth, and their life became 
<A NAME="140"></A>more settled; some even began to build themselves walls on the strength 
<A NAME="141"></A>of their newly acquired riches. For the love of gain would reconcile the 
<A NAME="142"></A>weaker to the dominion of the stronger, and the possession of capital enabled 
<A NAME="143"></A>the more powerful to reduce the smaller towns to subjection. And it was 
<A NAME="144"></A>at a somewhat later stage of this development that they went on the expedition 
<A NAME="145"></A>against Troy.
<A NAME="146"></A><BR><BR>What enabled Agamemnon to raise the armament was more, in my opinion, 
<A NAME="147"></A>his superiority in strength, than the oaths of Tyndareus, which bound the 
<A NAME="148"></A>suitors to follow him. Indeed, the account given by those Peloponnesians 
<A NAME="149"></A>who have been the recipients of the most credible tradition is this. First 
<A NAME="150"></A>of all Pelops, arriving among a needy population from Asia with vast wealth, 
<A NAME="151"></A>acquired such power that, stranger though he was, the country was called 
<A NAME="152"></A>after him; and this power fortune saw fit materially to increase in the 
<A NAME="153"></A>hands of his descendants. Eurystheus had been killed in Attica by the Heraclids. 
<A NAME="154"></A>Atreus was his mother's brother; and to the hands of his relation, who 
<A NAME="155"></A>had left his father on account of the death of Chrysippus, Eurystheus, 
<A NAME="156"></A>when he set out on his expedition, had committed Mycenae and the government. 
<A NAME="157"></A>As time went on and Eurystheus did not return, Atreus complied with the 
<A NAME="158"></A>wishes of the Mycenaeans, who were influenced by fear of the Heraclids- 
<A NAME="159"></A>besides, his power seemed considerable, and he had not neglected to court 
<A NAME="160"></A>the favour of the populace- and assumed the sceptre of Mycenae and the 
<A NAME="161"></A>rest of the dominions of Eurystheus. And so the power of the descendants 
<A NAME="162"></A>of Pelops came to be greater than that of the descendants of Perseus. To 
<A NAME="163"></A>all this Agamemnon succeeded. He had also a navy far stronger than his 
<A NAME="164"></A>contemporaries, so that, in my opinion, fear was quite as strong an element 
<A NAME="165"></A>as love in the formation of the confederate expedition. The strength of 
<A NAME="166"></A>his navy is shown by the fact that his own was the largest contingent, 
<A NAME="167"></A>and that of the Arcadians was furnished by him; this at least is what Homer 
<A NAME="168"></A>says, if his testimony is deemed sufficient. Besides, in his account of 
<A NAME="169"></A>the transmission of the sceptre, he calls him "Of many an isle, and of 
<A NAME="170"></A>all Argos king." Now Agamemnon's was a continental power; and he could 
<A NAME="171"></A>not have been master of any except the adjacent islands (and these would 
<A NAME="172"></A>not be many), but through the possession of a fleet.
<A NAME="173"></A><BR><BR>And from this expedition we may infer the character of earlier 
<A NAME="174"></A>enterprises. Now Mycenae may have been a small place, and many of the towns 
<A NAME="175"></A>of that age may appear comparatively insignificant, but no exact observer 
<A NAME="176"></A>would therefore feel justified in rejecting the estimate given by the poets 
<A NAME="177"></A>and by tradition of the magnitude of the armament. For I suppose if Lacedaemon 
<A NAME="178"></A>were to become desolate, and the temples and the foundations of the public 
<A NAME="179"></A>buildings were left, that as time went on there would be a strong disposition 
<A NAME="180"></A>with posterity to refuse to accept her fame as a true exponent of her power. 
<A NAME="181"></A>And yet they occupy two-fifths of Peloponnese and lead the whole, not to 
<A NAME="182"></A>speak of their numerous allies without. Still, as the city is neither built 
<A NAME="183"></A>in a compact form nor adorned with magnificent temples and public edifices, 
<A NAME="184"></A>but composed of villages after the old fashion of Hellas, there would be 
<A NAME="185"></A>an impression of inadequacy. Whereas, if Athens were to suffer the same 
<A NAME="186"></A>misfortune, I suppose that any inference from the appearance presented 
<A NAME="187"></A>to the eye would make her power to have been twice as great as it is. We 
<A NAME="188"></A>have therefore no right to be sceptical, nor to content ourselves with 
<A NAME="189"></A>an inspection of a town to the exclusion of a consideration of its power; 
<A NAME="190"></A>but we may safely conclude that the armament in question surpassed all 
<A NAME="191"></A>before it, as it fell short of modern efforts; if we can here also accept 
<A NAME="192"></A>the testimony of Homer's poems, in which, without allowing for the exaggeration 
<A NAME="193"></A>which a poet would feel himself licensed to employ, we can see that it 
<A NAME="194"></A>was far from equalling ours. He has represented it as consisting of twelve 
<A NAME="195"></A>hundred vessels; the Boeotian complement of each ship being a hundred and 
<A NAME="196"></A>twenty men, that of the ships of Philoctetes fifty. By this, I conceive, 
<A NAME="197"></A>he meant to convey the maximum and the minimum complement: at any rate, 
<A NAME="198"></A>he does not specify the amount of any others in his catalogue of the ships. 
<A NAME="199"></A>That they were all rowers as well as warriors we see from his account of 
<A NAME="200"></A>the ships of Philoctetes, in which all the men at the oar are bowmen. Now 
<A NAME="201"></A>it is improbable that many supernumeraries sailed, if we except the kings 
<A NAME="202"></A>and high officers; especially as they had to cross the open sea with munitions 
<A NAME="203"></A>of war, in ships, moreover, that had no decks, but were equipped in the 
<A NAME="204"></A>old piratical fashion. So that if we strike the average of the largest 
<A NAME="205"></A>and smallest ships, the number of those who sailed will appear inconsiderable, 
<A NAME="206"></A>representing, as they did, the whole force of Hellas. And this was due 
<A NAME="207"></A>not so much to scarcity of men as of money. Difficulty of subsistence made 
<A NAME="208"></A>the invaders reduce the numbers of the army to a point at which it might 
<A NAME="209"></A>live on the country during the prosecution of the war. Even after the victory 
<A NAME="210"></A>they obtained on their arrival- and a victory there must have been, or 
<A NAME="211"></A>the fortifications of the naval camp could never have been built- there 
<A NAME="212"></A>is no indication of their whole force having been employed; on the contrary, 
<A NAME="213"></A>they seem to have turned to cultivation of the Chersonese and to piracy 
<A NAME="214"></A>from want of supplies. This was what really enabled the Trojans to keep 
<A NAME="215"></A>the field for ten years against them; the dispersion of the enemy making 
<A NAME="216"></A>them always a match for the detachment left behind. If they had brought 
<A NAME="217"></A>plenty of supplies with them, and had persevered in the war without scattering 
<A NAME="218"></A>for piracy and agriculture, they would have easily defeated the Trojans 
<A NAME="219"></A>in the field, since they could hold their own against them with the division 
<A NAME="220"></A>on service. In short, if they had stuck to the siege, the capture of Troy 
<A NAME="221"></A>would have cost them less time and less trouble. But as want of money proved 
<A NAME="222"></A>the weakness of earlier expeditions, so from the same cause even the one 
<A NAME="223"></A>in question, more famous than its predecessors, may be pronounced on the 
<A NAME="224"></A>evidence of what it effected to have been inferior to its renown and to 
<A NAME="225"></A>the current opinion about it formed under the tuition of the 
<A NAME="226"></A>poets.
<A NAME="227"></A><BR><BR>Even after the Trojan War, Hellas was still engaged in removing 
<A NAME="228"></A>and settling, and thus could not attain to the quiet which must precede 
<A NAME="229"></A>growth. The late return of the Hellenes from Ilium caused many revolutions, 
<A NAME="230"></A>and factions ensued almost everywhere; and it was the citizens thus driven 
<A NAME="231"></A>into exile who founded the cities. Sixty years after the capture of Ilium, 
<A NAME="232"></A>the modern Boeotians were driven out of Arne by the Thessalians, and settled 
<A NAME="233"></A>in the present Boeotia, the former Cadmeis; though there was a division 
<A NAME="234"></A>of them there before, some of whom joined the expedition to Ilium. Twenty 
<A NAME="235"></A>years later, the Dorians and the Heraclids became masters of Peloponnese; 
<A NAME="236"></A>so that much had to be done and many years had to elapse before Hellas 
<A NAME="237"></A>could attain to a durable tranquillity undisturbed by removals, and could 
<A NAME="238"></A>begin to send out colonies, as Athens did to Ionia and most of the islands, 
<A NAME="239"></A>and the Peloponnesians to most of Italy and Sicily and some places in the 
<A NAME="240"></A>rest of Hellas. All these places were founded subsequently to the war with 
<A NAME="241"></A>Troy.
<A NAME="242"></A><BR><BR>But as the power of Hellas grew, and the acquisition of wealth 
<A NAME="243"></A>became more an object, the revenues of the states increasing, tyrannies 
<A NAME="244"></A>were by their means established almost everywhere- the old form of government 
<A NAME="245"></A>being hereditary monarchy with definite prerogatives- and Hellas began 
<A NAME="246"></A>to fit out fleets and apply herself more closely to the sea. It is said 
<A NAME="247"></A>that the Corinthians were the first to approach the modern style of naval 
<A NAME="248"></A>architecture, and that Corinth was the first place in Hellas where galleys 
<A NAME="249"></A>were built; and we have Ameinocles, a Corinthian shipwright, making four 
<A NAME="250"></A>ships for the Samians. Dating from the end of this war, it is nearly three 
<A NAME="251"></A>hundred years ago that Ameinocles went to Samos. Again, the earliest sea-fight 
<A NAME="252"></A>in history was between the Corinthians and Corcyraeans; this was about 
<A NAME="253"></A>two hundred and sixty years ago, dating from the same time. Planted on 
<A NAME="254"></A>an isthmus, Corinth had from time out of mind been a commercial emporium; 
<A NAME="255"></A>as formerly almost all communication between the Hellenes within and without 
<A NAME="256"></A>Peloponnese was carried on overland, and the Corinthian territory was the 
<A NAME="257"></A>highway through which it travelled. She had consequently great money resources, 
<A NAME="258"></A>as is shown by the epithet "wealthy" bestowed by the old poets on the place, 
<A NAME="259"></A>and this enabled her, when traffic by sea became more common, to procure 
<A NAME="260"></A>her navy and put down piracy; and as she could offer a mart for both branches 
<A NAME="261"></A>of the trade, she acquired for herself all the power which a large revenue 
<A NAME="262"></A>affords. Subsequently the Ionians attained to great naval strength in the 
<A NAME="263"></A>reign of Cyrus, the first king of the Persians, and of his son Cambyses, 
<A NAME="264"></A>and while they were at war with the former commanded for a while the Ionian 
<A NAME="265"></A>sea. Polycrates also, the tyrant of Samos, had a powerful navy in the reign 
<A NAME="266"></A>of Cambyses, with which he reduced many of the islands, and among them 
<A NAME="267"></A>Rhenea, which he consecrated to the Delian Apollo. About this time also 
<A NAME="268"></A>the Phocaeans, while they were founding Marseilles, defeated the Carthaginians 
<A NAME="269"></A>in a sea-fight. These were the most powerful navies. And even these, although 
<A NAME="270"></A>so many generations had elapsed since the Trojan war, seem to have been 
<A NAME="271"></A>principally composed of the old fifty-oars and long-boats, and to have 
<A NAME="272"></A>counted few galleys among their ranks. Indeed it was only shortly the Persian 
<A NAME="273"></A>war, and the death of Darius the successor of Cambyses, that the Sicilian 
<A NAME="274"></A>tyrants and the Corcyraeans acquired any large number of galleys. For after 
<A NAME="275"></A>these there were no navies of any account in Hellas till the expedition 
<A NAME="276"></A>of Xerxes; Aegina, Athens, and others may have possessed a few vessels, 
<A NAME="277"></A>but they were principally fifty-oars. It was quite at the end of this period 
<A NAME="278"></A>that the war with Aegina and the prospect of the barbarian invasion enabled 
<A NAME="279"></A>Themistocles to persuade the Athenians to build the fleet with which they 
<A NAME="280"></A>fought at Salamis; and even these vessels had not complete 
<A NAME="281"></A>decks.
<A NAME="282"></A><BR><BR>The navies, then, of the Hellenes during the period we have traversed 
<A NAME="283"></A>were what I have described. All their insignificance did not prevent their 
<A NAME="284"></A>being an element of the greatest power to those who cultivated them, alike 
<A NAME="285"></A>in revenue and in dominion. They were the means by which the islands were 
<A NAME="286"></A>reached and reduced, those of the smallest area falling the easiest prey. 
<A NAME="287"></A>Wars by land there were none, none at least by which power was acquired; 
<A NAME="288"></A>we have the usual border contests, but of distant expeditions with conquest 
<A NAME="289"></A>for object we hear nothing among the Hellenes. There was no union of subject 
<A NAME="290"></A>cities round a great state, no spontaneous combination of equals for confederate 
<A NAME="291"></A>expeditions; what fighting there was consisted merely of local warfare 
<A NAME="292"></A>between rival neighbours. The nearest approach to a coalition took place 
<A NAME="293"></A>in the old war between Chalcis and Eretria; this was a quarrel in which 
<A NAME="294"></A>the rest of the Hellenic name did to some extent take 
<A NAME="295"></A>sides.
<A NAME="296"></A><BR><BR>Various, too, were the obstacles which the national growth encountered 
<A NAME="297"></A>in various localities. The power of the Ionians was advancing with rapid 
<A NAME="298"></A>strides, when it came into collision with Persia, under King Cyrus, who, 
<A NAME="299"></A>after having dethroned Croesus and overrun everything between the Halys 
<A NAME="300"></A>and the sea, stopped not till he had reduced the cities of the coast; the 
<A NAME="301"></A>islands being only left to be subdued by Darius and the Phoenician 
<A NAME="302"></A>navy.
<A NAME="303"></A><BR><BR>Again, wherever there were tyrants, their habit of providing simply 
<A NAME="304"></A>for themselves, of looking solely to their personal comfort and family 
<A NAME="305"></A>aggrandizement, made safety the great aim of their policy, and prevented 
<A NAME="306"></A>anything great proceeding from them; though they would each have their 
<A NAME="307"></A>affairs with their immediate neighbours. All this is only true of the mother 
<A NAME="308"></A>country, for in Sicily they attained to very great power. Thus for a long 
<A NAME="309"></A>time everywhere in Hellas do we find causes which make the states alike 
<A NAME="310"></A>incapable of combination for great and national ends, or of any vigorous 
<A NAME="311"></A>action of their own.
<A NAME="312"></A><BR><BR>But at last a time came when the tyrants of Athens and the far 
<A NAME="313"></A>older tyrannies of the rest of Hellas were, with the exception of those 
<A NAME="314"></A>in Sicily, once and for all put down by Lacedaemon; for this city, though 
<A NAME="315"></A>after the settlement of the Dorians, its present inhabitants, it suffered 
<A NAME="316"></A>from factions for an unparalleled length of time, still at a very early 
<A NAME="317"></A>period obtained good laws, and enjoyed a freedom from tyrants which was 
<A NAME="318"></A>unbroken; it has possessed the same form of government for more than four 
<A NAME="319"></A>hundred years, reckoning to the end of the late war, and has thus been 
<A NAME="320"></A>in a position to arrange the affairs of the other states. Not many years 
<A NAME="321"></A>after the deposition of the tyrants, the battle of Marathon was fought 
<A NAME="322"></A>between the Medes and the Athenians. Ten years afterwards, the barbarian 
<A NAME="323"></A>returned with the armada for the subjugation of Hellas. In the face of 
<A NAME="324"></A>this great danger, the command of the confederate Hellenes was assumed 
<A NAME="325"></A>by the Lacedaemonians in virtue of their superior power; and the Athenians, 
<A NAME="326"></A>having made up their minds to abandon their city, broke up their homes, 
<A NAME="327"></A>threw themselves into their ships, and became a naval people. This coalition, 
<A NAME="328"></A>after repulsing the barbarian, soon afterwards split into two sections, 
<A NAME="329"></A>which included the Hellenes who had revolted from the King, as well as 
<A NAME="330"></A>those who had aided him in the war. At the end of the one stood Athens, 
<A NAME="331"></A>at the head of the other Lacedaemon, one the first naval, the other the 
<A NAME="332"></A>first military power in Hellas. For a short time the league held together, 
<A NAME="333"></A>till the Lacedaemonians and Athenians quarrelled and made war upon each 
<A NAME="334"></A>other with their allies, a duel into which all the Hellenes sooner or later 
<A NAME="335"></A>were drawn, though some might at first remain neutral. So that the whole 
<A NAME="336"></A>period from the Median war to this, with some peaceful intervals, was spent 
<A NAME="337"></A>by each power in war, either with its rival, or with its own revolted allies, 
<A NAME="338"></A>and consequently afforded them constant practice in military matters, and 
<A NAME="339"></A>that experience which is learnt in the school of danger.
<A NAME="340"></A><BR><BR>The policy of Lacedaemon was not to exact tribute from her allies, 
<A NAME="341"></A>but merely to secure their subservience to her interests by establishing 
<A NAME="342"></A>oligarchies among them; Athens, on the contrary, had by degrees deprived 
<A NAME="343"></A>hers of their ships, and imposed instead contributions in money on all 
<A NAME="344"></A>except Chios and Lesbos. Both found their resources for this war separately 
<A NAME="345"></A>to exceed the sum of their strength when the alliance flourished 
<A NAME="346"></A>intact.
<A NAME="347"></A><BR><BR>Having now given the result of my inquiries into early times, I 
<A NAME="348"></A>grant that there will be a difficulty in believing every particular detail. 
<A NAME="349"></A>The way that most men deal with traditions, even traditions of their own 
<A NAME="350"></A>country, is to receive them all alike as they are delivered, without applying 
<A NAME="351"></A>any critical test whatever. The general Athenian public fancy that Hipparchus 
<A NAME="352"></A>was tyrant when he fell by the hands of Harmodius and Aristogiton, not 
<A NAME="353"></A>knowing that Hippias, the eldest of the sons of Pisistratus, was really 
<A NAME="354"></A>supreme, and that Hipparchus and Thessalus were his brothers; and that 
<A NAME="355"></A>Harmodius and Aristogiton suspecting, on the very day, nay at the very 
<A NAME="356"></A>moment fixed on for the deed, that information had been conveyed to Hippias 
<A NAME="357"></A>by their accomplices, concluded that he had been warned, and did not attack 
<A NAME="358"></A>him, yet, not liking to be apprehended and risk their lives for nothing, 
<A NAME="359"></A>fell upon Hipparchus near the temple of the daughters of Leos, and slew 
<A NAME="360"></A>him as he was arranging the Panathenaic procession.
<A NAME="361"></A><BR><BR>There are many other unfounded ideas current among the rest of 
<A NAME="362"></A>the Hellenes, even on matters of contemporary history, which have not been 
<A NAME="363"></A>obscured by time. For instance, there is the notion that the Lacedaemonian 
<A NAME="364"></A>kings have two votes each, the fact being that they have only one; and 
<A NAME="365"></A>that there is a company of Pitane, there being simply no such thing. So 
<A NAME="366"></A>little pains do the vulgar take in the investigation of truth, accepting 
<A NAME="367"></A>readily the first story that comes to hand. On the whole, however, the 
<A NAME="368"></A>conclusions I have drawn from the proofs quoted may, I believe, safely 
<A NAME="369"></A>be relied on. Assuredly they will not be disturbed either by the lays of 
<A NAME="370"></A>a poet displaying the exaggeration of his craft, or by the compositions 
<A NAME="371"></A>of the chroniclers that are attractive at truth's expense; the subjects 
<A NAME="372"></A>they treat of being out of the reach of evidence, and time having robbed 
<A NAME="373"></A>most of them of historical value by enthroning them in the region of legend. 
<A NAME="374"></A>Turning from these, we can rest satisfied with having proceeded upon the 
<A NAME="375"></A>clearest data, and having arrived at conclusions as exact as can be expected 
<A NAME="376"></A>in matters of such antiquity. To come to this war: despite the known disposition 
<A NAME="377"></A>of the actors in a struggle to overrate its importance, and when it is 
<A NAME="378"></A>over to return to their admiration of earlier events, yet an examination 
<A NAME="379"></A>of the facts will show that it was much greater than the wars which preceded 
<A NAME="380"></A>it.
<A NAME="381"></A><BR><BR>With reference to the speeches in this history, some were delivered 
<A NAME="382"></A>before the war began, others while it was going on; some I heard myself, 
<A NAME="383"></A>others I got from various quarters; it was in all cases difficult to carry 
<A NAME="384"></A>them word for word in one's memory, so my habit has been to make the speakers 
<A NAME="385"></A>say what was in my opinion demanded of them by the various occasions, of 
<A NAME="386"></A>course adhering as closely as possible to the general sense of what they 
<A NAME="387"></A>really said. And with reference to the narrative of events, far from permitting 
<A NAME="388"></A>myself to derive it from the first source that came to hand, I did not 
<A NAME="389"></A>even trust my own impressions, but it rests partly on what I saw myself, 
<A NAME="390"></A>partly on what others saw for me, the accuracy of the report being always 
<A NAME="391"></A>tried by the most severe and detailed tests possible. My conclusions have 
<A NAME="392"></A>cost me some labour from the want of coincidence between accounts of the 
<A NAME="393"></A>same occurrences by different eye-witnesses, arising sometimes from imperfect 
<A NAME="394"></A>memory, sometimes from undue partiality for one side or the other. The 
<A NAME="395"></A>absence of romance in my history will, I fear, detract somewhat from its 
<A NAME="396"></A>interest; but if it be judged useful by those inquirers who desire an exact 
<A NAME="397"></A>knowledge of the past as an aid to the interpretation of the future, which 
<A NAME="398"></A>in the course of human things must resemble if it does not reflect it, 
<A NAME="399"></A>I shall be content. In fine, I have written my work, not as an essay which 
<A NAME="400"></A>is to win the applause of the moment, but as a possession for all 
<A NAME="401"></A>time.
<A NAME="402"></A><BR><BR>The Median War, the greatest achievement of past times, yet found 
<A NAME="403"></A>a speedy decision in two actions by sea and two by land. The Peloponnesian 
<A NAME="404"></A>War was prolonged to an immense length, and, long as it was, it was short 
<A NAME="405"></A>without parallel for the misfortunes that it brought upon Hellas. Never 
<A NAME="406"></A>had so many cities been taken and laid desolate, here by the barbarians, 
<A NAME="407"></A>here by the parties contending (the old inhabitants being sometimes removed 
<A NAME="408"></A>to make room for others); never was there so much banishing and blood-shedding, 
<A NAME="409"></A>now on the field of battle, now in the strife of faction. Old stories of 
<A NAME="410"></A>occurrences handed down by tradition, but scantily confirmed by experience, 
<A NAME="411"></A>suddenly ceased to be incredible; there were earthquakes of unparalleled 
<A NAME="412"></A>extent and violence; eclipses of the sun occurred with a frequency unrecorded 
<A NAME="413"></A>in previous history; there were great droughts in sundry places and consequent 
<A NAME="414"></A>famines, and that most calamitous and awfully fatal visitation, the plague. 
<A NAME="415"></A>All this came upon them with the late war, which was begun by the Athenians 
<A NAME="416"></A>and Peloponnesians by the dissolution of the thirty years' truce made after 
<A NAME="417"></A>the conquest of Euboea. To the question why they broke the treaty, I answer 
<A NAME="418"></A>by placing first an account of their grounds of complaint and points of 
<A NAME="419"></A>difference, that no one may ever have to ask the immediate cause which 
<A NAME="420"></A>plunged the Hellenes into a war of such magnitude. The real cause I consider 
<A NAME="421"></A>to be the one which was formally most kept out of sight. The growth of 
<A NAME="422"></A>the power of Athens, and the alarm which this inspired in Lacedaemon, made 
<A NAME="423"></A>war inevitable. Still it is well to give the grounds alleged by either 
<A NAME="424"></A>side which led to the dissolution of the treaty and the breaking out of 
<A NAME="425"></A>the war.

<A NAME="426"></A><B>Chapter II</B>

<A NAME="427"></A><BR><BR><B>Causes of the War - The Affair of Epidamnus -</B> <B>The Affair 
<A NAME="428"></A>of Potidaea</B>
<A NAME="429"></A><BR><BR>The city of Epidamnus stands on the right of the entrance of the 
<A NAME="430"></A>Ionic Gulf. Its vicinity is inhabited by the Taulantians, an Illyrian people. 
<A NAME="431"></A>The place is a colony from Corcyra, founded by Phalius, son of Eratocleides, 
<A NAME="432"></A>of the family of the Heraclids, who had according to ancient usage been 
<A NAME="433"></A>summoned for the purpose from Corinth, the mother country. The colonists 
<A NAME="434"></A>were joined by some Corinthians, and others of the Dorian race. Now, as 
<A NAME="435"></A>time went on, the city of Epidamnus became great and populous; but falling 
<A NAME="436"></A>a prey to factions arising, it is said, from a war with her neighbours 
<A NAME="437"></A>the barbarians, she became much enfeebled, and lost a considerable amount 
<A NAME="438"></A>of her power. The last act before the war was the expulsion of the nobles 
<A NAME="439"></A>by the people. The exiled party joined the barbarians, and proceeded to 
<A NAME="440"></A>plunder those in the city by sea and land; and the Epidamnians, finding 
<A NAME="441"></A>themselves hard pressed, sent ambassadors to Corcyra beseeching their mother 
<A NAME="442"></A>country not to allow them to perish, but to make up matters between them 
<A NAME="443"></A>and the exiles, and to rid them of the war with the barbarians. The ambassadors 
<A NAME="444"></A>seated themselves in the temple of Hera as suppliants, and made the above 
<A NAME="445"></A>requests to the Corcyraeans. But the Corcyraeans refused to accept their 
<A NAME="446"></A>supplication, and they were dismissed without having effected 
<A NAME="447"></A>anything.
<A NAME="448"></A><BR><BR>When the Epidamnians found that no help could be expected from 
<A NAME="449"></A>Corcyra, they were in a strait what to do next. So they sent to Delphi 
<A NAME="450"></A>and inquired of the God whether they should deliver their city to the Corinthians 
<A NAME="451"></A>and endeavour to obtain some assistance from their founders. The answer 
<A NAME="452"></A>he gave them was to deliver the city and place themselves under Corinthian 
<A NAME="453"></A>protection. So the Epidamnians went to Corinth and delivered over the colony 
<A NAME="454"></A>in obedience to the commands of the oracle. They showed that their founder 
<A NAME="455"></A>came from Corinth, and revealed the answer of the god; and they begged 
<A NAME="456"></A>them not to allow them to perish, but to assist them. This the Corinthians 
<A NAME="457"></A>consented to do. Believing the colony to belong as much to themselves as 
<A NAME="458"></A>to the Corcyraeans, they felt it to be a kind of duty to undertake their 
<A NAME="459"></A>protection. Besides, they hated the Corcyraeans for their contempt of the 
<A NAME="460"></A>mother country. Instead of meeting with the usual honours accorded to the 
<A NAME="461"></A>parent city by every other colony at public assemblies, such as precedence 
<A NAME="462"></A>at sacrifices, Corinth found herself treated with contempt by a power which 
<A NAME="463"></A>in point of wealth could stand comparison with any even of the richest 
<A NAME="464"></A>communities in Hellas, which possessed great military strength, and which 
<A NAME="465"></A>sometimes could not repress a pride in the high naval position of an, island 
<A NAME="466"></A>whose nautical renown dated from the days of its old inhabitants, the Phaeacians. 
<A NAME="467"></A>This was one reason of the care that they lavished on their fleet, which 
<A NAME="468"></A>became very efficient; indeed they began the war with a force of a hundred 
<A NAME="469"></A>and twenty galleys.
<A NAME="470"></A><BR><BR>All these grievances made Corinth eager to send the promised aid 
<A NAME="471"></A>to Epidamnus. Advertisement was made for volunteer settlers, and a force 
<A NAME="472"></A>of Ambraciots, Leucadians, and Corinthians was dispatched. They marched 
<A NAME="473"></A>by land to Apollonia, a Corinthian colony, the route by sea being avoided 
<A NAME="474"></A>from fear of Corcyraean interruption. When the Corcyraeans heard of the 
<A NAME="475"></A>arrival of the settlers and troops in Epidamnus, and the surrender of the 
<A NAME="476"></A>colony to Corinth, they took fire. Instantly putting to sea with five-and-twenty 
<A NAME="477"></A>ships, which were quickly followed by others, they insolently commanded 
<A NAME="478"></A>the Epidamnians to receive back the banished nobles- (it must be premised 
<A NAME="479"></A>that the Epidamnian exiles had come to Corcyra and, pointing to the sepulchres 
<A NAME="480"></A>of their ancestors, had appealed to their kindred to restore them)- and 
<A NAME="481"></A>to dismiss the Corinthian garrison and settlers. But to all this the Epidamnians 
<A NAME="482"></A>turned a deaf ear. Upon this the Corcyraeans commenced operations against 
<A NAME="483"></A>them with a fleet of forty sail. They took with them the exiles, with a 
<A NAME="484"></A>view to their restoration, and also secured the services of the Illyrians. 
<A NAME="485"></A>Sitting down before the city, they issued a proclamation to the effect 
<A NAME="486"></A>that any of the natives that chose, and the foreigners, might depart unharmed, 
<A NAME="487"></A>with the alternative of being treated as enemies. On their refusal the 
<A NAME="488"></A>Corcyraeans proceeded to besiege the city, which stands on an isthmus; 
<A NAME="489"></A>and the Corinthians, receiving intelligence of the investment of Epidamnus, 
<A NAME="490"></A>got together an armament and proclaimed a colony to Epidamnus, perfect 
<A NAME="491"></A>political equality being guaranteed to all who chose to go. Any who were 
<A NAME="492"></A>not prepared to sail at once might, by paying down the sum of fifty Corinthian 
<A NAME="493"></A>drachmae, have a share in the colony without leaving Corinth. Great numbers 
<A NAME="494"></A>took advantage of this proclamation, some being ready to start directly, 
<A NAME="495"></A>others paying the requisite forfeit. In case of their passage being disputed 
<A NAME="496"></A>by the Corcyraeans, several cities were asked to lend them a convoy. Megara 
<A NAME="497"></A>prepared to accompany them with eight ships, Pale in Cephallonia with four; 
<A NAME="498"></A>Epidaurus furnished five, Hermione one, Troezen two, Leucas ten, and Ambracia 
<A NAME="499"></A>eight. The Thebans and Phliasians were asked for money, the Eleans for 
<A NAME="500"></A>hulls as well; while Corinth herself furnished thirty ships and three thousand 
<A NAME="501"></A>heavy infantry.
<A NAME="502"></A><BR><BR>When the Corcyraeans heard of their preparations they came to Corinth 
<A NAME="503"></A>with envoys from Lacedaemon and Sicyon, whom they persuaded to accompany 
<A NAME="504"></A>them, and bade her recall the garrison and settlers, as she had nothing 
<A NAME="505"></A>to do with Epidamnus. If, however, she had any claims to make, they were 
<A NAME="506"></A>willing to submit the matter to the arbitration of such of the cities in 
<A NAME="507"></A>Peloponnese as should be chosen by mutual agreement, and that the colony 
<A NAME="508"></A>should remain with the city to whom the arbitrators might assign it. They 
<A NAME="509"></A>were also willing to refer the matter to the oracle at Delphi. If, in defiance 
<A NAME="510"></A>of their protestations, war was appealed to, they should be themselves 
<A NAME="511"></A>compelled by this violence to seek friends in quarters where they had no 
<A NAME="512"></A>desire to seek them, and to make even old ties give way to the necessity 
<A NAME="513"></A>of assistance. The answer they got from Corinth was that, if they would 
<A NAME="514"></A>withdraw their fleet and the barbarians from Epidamnus, negotiation might 
<A NAME="515"></A>be possible; but, while the town was still being besieged, going before 
<A NAME="516"></A>arbitrators was out of the question. The Corcyraeans retorted that if Corinth 
<A NAME="517"></A>would withdraw her troops from Epidamnus they would withdraw theirs, or 
<A NAME="518"></A>they were ready to let both parties remain in statu quo, an armistice being 
<A NAME="519"></A>concluded till judgment could be given.
<A NAME="520"></A><BR><BR>Turning a deaf ear to all these proposals, when their ships were 
<A NAME="521"></A>manned and their allies had come in, the Corinthians sent a herald before 
<A NAME="522"></A>them to declare war and, getting under way with seventy-five ships and 
<A NAME="523"></A>two thousand heavy infantry, sailed for Epidamnus to give battle to the 
<A NAME="524"></A>Corcyraeans. The fleet was under the command of Aristeus, son of Pellichas, 
<A NAME="525"></A>Callicrates, son of Callias, and Timanor, son of Timanthes; the troops 
<A NAME="526"></A>under that of Archetimus, son of Eurytimus, and Isarchidas, son of Isarchus. 
<A NAME="527"></A>When they had reached Actium in the territory of Anactorium, at the mouth 
<A NAME="528"></A>of the mouth of the Gulf of Ambracia, where the temple of Apollo stands, 
<A NAME="529"></A>the Corcyraeans sent on a herald in a light boat to warn them not to sail 
<A NAME="530"></A>against them. Meanwhile they proceeded to man their ships, all of which 
<A NAME="531"></A>had been equipped for action, the old vessels being undergirded to make 
<A NAME="532"></A>them seaworthy. On the return of the herald without any peaceful answer 
<A NAME="533"></A>from the Corinthians, their ships being now manned, they put out to sea 
<A NAME="534"></A>to meet the enemy with a fleet of eighty sail (forty were engaged in the 
<A NAME="535"></A>siege of Epidamnus), formed line, and went into action, and gained a decisive 
<A NAME="536"></A>victory, and destroyed fifteen of the Corinthian vessels. The same day 
<A NAME="537"></A>had seen Epidamnus compelled by its besiegers to capitulate; the conditions 
<A NAME="538"></A>being that the foreigners should be sold, and the Corinthians kept as prisoners 
<A NAME="539"></A>of war, till their fate should be otherwise decided.
<A NAME="540"></A><BR><BR>After the engagement the Corcyraeans set up a trophy on Leukimme, 
<A NAME="541"></A>a headland of Corcyra, and slew all their captives except the Corinthians, 
<A NAME="542"></A>whom they kept as prisoners of war. Defeated at sea, the Corinthians and 
<A NAME="543"></A>their allies repaired home, and left the Corcyraeans masters of all the 
<A NAME="544"></A>sea about those parts. Sailing to Leucas, a Corinthian colony, they ravaged 
<A NAME="545"></A>their territory, and burnt Cyllene, the harbour of the Eleans, because 
<A NAME="546"></A>they had furnished ships and money to Corinth. For almost the whole of 
<A NAME="547"></A>the period that followed the battle they remained masters of the sea, and 
<A NAME="548"></A>the allies of Corinth were harassed by Corcyraean cruisers. At last Corinth, 
<A NAME="549"></A>roused by the sufferings of her allies, sent out ships and troops in the 
<A NAME="550"></A>fall of the summer, who formed an encampment at Actium and about Chimerium, 
<A NAME="551"></A>in Thesprotis, for the protection of Leucas and the rest of the friendly 
<A NAME="552"></A>cities. The Corcyraeans on their part formed a similar station on Leukimme. 
<A NAME="553"></A>Neither party made any movement, but they remained confronting each other 
<A NAME="554"></A>till the end of the summer, and winter was at hand before either of them 
<A NAME="555"></A>returned home.
<A NAME="556"></A><BR><BR>Corinth, exasperated by the war with the Corcyraeans, spent the 
<A NAME="557"></A>whole of the year after the engagement and that succeeding it in building 
<A NAME="558"></A>ships, and in straining every nerve to form an efficient fleet; rowers 
<A NAME="559"></A>being drawn from Peloponnese and the rest of Hellas by the inducement of 
<A NAME="560"></A>large bounties. The Corcyraeans, alarmed at the news of their preparations, 
<A NAME="561"></A>being without a single ally in Hellas (for they had not enrolled themselves 
<A NAME="562"></A>either in the Athenian or in the Lacedaemonian confederacy), decided to 
<A NAME="563"></A>repair to Athens in order to enter into alliance and to endeavour to procure 
<A NAME="564"></A>support from her. Corinth also, hearing of their intentions, sent an embassy 
<A NAME="565"></A>to Athens to prevent the Corcyraean navy being joined by the Athenian, 
<A NAME="566"></A>and her prospect of ordering the war according to her wishes being thus 
<A NAME="567"></A>impeded. An assembly was convoked, and the rival advocates appeared: the 
<A NAME="568"></A>Corcyraeans spoke as follows:
<A NAME="569"></A><BR><BR>"Athenians! when a people that have not rendered any important 
<A NAME="570"></A>service or support to their neighbours in times past, for which they might 
<A NAME="571"></A>claim to be repaid, appear before them as we now appear before you to solicit 
<A NAME="572"></A>their assistance, they may fairly be required to satisfy certain preliminary 
<A NAME="573"></A>conditions. They should show, first, that it is expedient or at least safe 
<A NAME="574"></A>to grant their request; next, that they will retain a lasting sense of 
<A NAME="575"></A>the kindness. But if they cannot clearly establish any of these points, 
<A NAME="576"></A>they must not be annoyed if they meet with a rebuff. Now the Corcyraeans 
<A NAME="577"></A>believe that with their petition for assistance they can also give you 
<A NAME="578"></A>a satisfactory answer on these points, and they have therefore dispatched 
<A NAME="579"></A>us hither. It has so happened that our policy as regards you with respect 
<A NAME="580"></A>to this request, turns out to be inconsistent, and as regards our interests, 
<A NAME="581"></A>to be at the present crisis inexpedient. We say inconsistent, because a 
<A NAME="582"></A>power which has never in the whole of her past history been willing to 
<A NAME="583"></A>ally herself with any of her neighbours, is now found asking them to ally 
<A NAME="584"></A>themselves with her. And we say inexpedient, because in our present war 
<A NAME="585"></A>with Corinth it has left us in a position of entire isolation, and what 
<A NAME="586"></A>once seemed the wise precaution of refusing to involve ourselves in alliances 
<A NAME="587"></A>with other powers, lest we should also involve ourselves in risks of their 
<A NAME="588"></A>choosing, has now proved to be folly and weakness. It is true that in the 
<A NAME="589"></A>late naval engagement we drove back the Corinthians from our shores single-handed. 
<A NAME="590"></A>But they have now got together a still larger armament from Peloponnese 
<A NAME="591"></A>and the rest of Hellas; and we, seeing our utter inability to cope with 
<A NAME="592"></A>them without foreign aid, and the magnitude of the danger which subjection 
<A NAME="593"></A>to them implies, find it necessary to ask help from you and from every 
<A NAME="594"></A>other power. And we hope to be excused if we forswear our old principle 
<A NAME="595"></A>of complete political isolation, a principle which was not adopted with 
<A NAME="596"></A>any sinister intention, but was rather the consequence of an error in 
<A NAME="597"></A>judgment.
<A NAME="598"></A><BR><BR>"Now there are many reasons why in the event of your compliance 
<A NAME="599"></A>you will congratulate yourselves on this request having been made to you. 
<A NAME="600"></A>First, because your assistance will be rendered to a power which, herself 
<A NAME="601"></A>inoffensive, is a victim to the injustice of others. Secondly, because 
<A NAME="602"></A>all that we most value is at stake in the present contest, and your welcome 
<A NAME="603"></A>of us under these circumstances will be a proof of goodwill which will 
<A NAME="604"></A>ever keep alive the gratitude you will lay up in our hearts. Thirdly, yourselves 
<A NAME="605"></A>excepted, we are the greatest naval power in Hellas. Moreover, can you 
<A NAME="606"></A>conceive a stroke of good fortune more rare in itself, or more disheartening 
<A NAME="607"></A>to your enemies, than that the power whose adhesion you would have valued 
<A NAME="608"></A>above much material and moral strength should present herself self-invited, 
<A NAME="609"></A>should deliver herself into your hands without danger and without expense, 
<A NAME="610"></A>and should lastly put you in the way of gaining a high character in the 
<A NAME="611"></A>eyes of the world, the gratitude of those whom you shall assist, and a 
<A NAME="612"></A>great accession of strength for yourselves? You may search all history 
<A NAME="613"></A>without finding many instances of a people gaining all these advantages 
<A NAME="614"></A>at once, or many instances of a power that comes in quest of assistance 
<A NAME="615"></A>being in a position to give to the people whose alliance she solicits as 
<A NAME="616"></A>much safety and honour as she will receive. But it will be urged that it 
<A NAME="617"></A>is only in the case of a war that we shall be found useful. To this we 
<A NAME="618"></A>answer that if any of you imagine that that war is far off, he is grievously 
<A NAME="619"></A>mistaken, and is blind to the fact that Lacedaemon regards you with jealousy 
<A NAME="620"></A>and desires war, and that Corinth is powerful there- the same, remember, 
<A NAME="621"></A>that is your enemy, and is even now trying to subdue us as a preliminary 
<A NAME="622"></A>to attacking you. And this she does to prevent our becoming united by a 
<A NAME="623"></A>common enmity, and her having us both on her hands, and also to ensure 
<A NAME="624"></A>getting the start of you in one of two ways, either by crippling our power 
<A NAME="625"></A>or by making its strength her own. Now it is our policy to be beforehand 
<A NAME="626"></A>with her- that is, for Corcyra to make an offer of alliance and for you 
<A NAME="627"></A>to accept it; in fact, we ought to form plans against her instead of waiting 
<A NAME="628"></A>to defeat the plans she forms against us.
<A NAME="629"></A><BR><BR>"If she asserts that for you to receive a colony of hers into alliance 
<A NAME="630"></A>is not right, let her know that every colony that is well treated honours 
<A NAME="631"></A>its parent state, but becomes estranged from it by injustice. For colonists 
<A NAME="632"></A>are not sent forth on the understanding that they are to be the slaves 
<A NAME="633"></A>of those that remain behind, but that they are to be their equals. And 
<A NAME="634"></A>that Corinth was injuring us is clear. Invited to refer the dispute about 
<A NAME="635"></A>Epidamnus to arbitration, they chose to prosecute their complaints war 
<A NAME="636"></A>rather than by a fair trial. And let their conduct towards us who are their 
<A NAME="637"></A>kindred be a warning to you not to be misled by their deceit, nor to yield 
<A NAME="638"></A>to their direct requests; concessions to adversaries only end in self-reproach, 
<A NAME="639"></A>and the more strictly they are avoided the greater will be the chance of 
<A NAME="640"></A>security.
<A NAME="641"></A><BR><BR>"If it be urged that your reception of us will be a breach of the 
<A NAME="642"></A>treaty existing between you and Lacedaemon, the answer is that we are a 
<A NAME="643"></A>neutral state, and that one of the express provisions of that treaty is 
<A NAME="644"></A>that it shall be competent for any Hellenic state that is neutral to join 
<A NAME="645"></A>whichever side it pleases. And it is intolerable for Corinth to be allowed 
<A NAME="646"></A>to obtain men for her navy not only from her allies, but also from the 
<A NAME="647"></A>rest of Hellas, no small number being furnished by your own subjects; while 
<A NAME="648"></A>we are to be excluded both from the alliance left open to us by treaty, 
<A NAME="649"></A>and from any assistance that we might get from other quarters, and you 
<A NAME="650"></A>are to be accused of political immorality if you comply with our request. 
<A NAME="651"></A>On the other hand, we shall have much greater cause to complain of you, 
<A NAME="652"></A>if you do not comply with it; if we, who are in peril and are no enemies 
<A NAME="653"></A>of yours, meet with a repulse at your hands, while Corinth, who is the 
<A NAME="654"></A>aggressor and your enemy, not only meets with no hindrance from you, but 
<A NAME="655"></A>is even allowed to draw material for war from your dependencies. This ought 
<A NAME="656"></A>not to be, but you should either forbid her enlisting men in your dominions, 
<A NAME="657"></A>or you should lend us too what help you may think advisable.
<A NAME="658"></A><BR><BR>"But your real policy is to afford us avowed countenance and support. 
<A NAME="659"></A>The advantages of this course, as we premised in the beginning of our speech, 
<A NAME="660"></A>are many. We mention one that is perhaps the chief. Could there be a clearer 
<A NAME="661"></A>guarantee of our good faith than is offered by the fact that the power 
<A NAME="662"></A>which is at enmity with you is also at enmity with us, and that that power 
<A NAME="663"></A>is fully able to punish defection? And there is a wide difference between 
<A NAME="664"></A>declining the alliance of an inland and of a maritime power. For your first 
<A NAME="665"></A>endeavour should be to prevent, if possible, the existence of any naval 
<A NAME="666"></A>power except your own; failing this, to secure the friendship of the strongest 
<A NAME="667"></A>that does exist. And if any of you believe that what we urge is expedient, 
<A NAME="668"></A>but fear to act upon this belief, lest it should lead to a breach of the 
<A NAME="669"></A>treaty, you must remember that on the one hand, whatever your fears, your 
<A NAME="670"></A>strength will be formidable to your antagonists; on the other, whatever 
<A NAME="671"></A>the confidence you derive from refusing to receive us, your weakness will 
<A NAME="672"></A>have no terrors for a strong enemy. You must also remember that your decision 
<A NAME="673"></A>is for Athens no less than Corcyra, and that you are not making the best 
<A NAME="674"></A>provision for her interests, if at a time when you are anxiously scanning 
<A NAME="675"></A>the horizon that you may be in readiness for the breaking out of the war 
<A NAME="676"></A>which is all but upon you, you hesitate to attach to your side a place 
<A NAME="677"></A>whose adhesion or estrangement is alike pregnant with the most vital consequences. 
<A NAME="678"></A>For it lies conveniently for the coast- navigation in the direction of 
<A NAME="679"></A>Italy and Sicily, being able to bar the passage of naval reinforcements 
<A NAME="680"></A>from thence to Peloponnese, and from Peloponnese thither; and it is in 
<A NAME="681"></A>other respects a most desirable station. To sum up as shortly as possible, 
<A NAME="682"></A>embracing both general and particular considerations, let this show you 
<A NAME="683"></A>the folly of sacrificing us. Remember that there are but three considerable 
<A NAME="684"></A>naval powers in Hellas- Athens, Corcyra, and Corinth- and that if you allow 
<A NAME="685"></A>two of these three to become one, and Corinth to secure us for herself, 
<A NAME="686"></A>you will have to hold the sea against the united fleets of Corcyra and 
<A NAME="687"></A>Peloponnese. But if you receive us, you will have our ships to reinforce 
<A NAME="688"></A>you in the struggle."
<A NAME="689"></A><BR><BR>Such were the words of the Corcyraeans. After they had finished, 
<A NAME="690"></A>the Corinthians spoke as follows:
<A NAME="691"></A><BR><BR>"These Corcyraeans in the speech we have just heard do not confine 
<A NAME="692"></A>themselves to the question of their reception into your alliance. They 
<A NAME="693"></A>also talk of our being guilty of injustice, and their being the victims 
<A NAME="694"></A>of an unjustifiable war. It becomes necessary for us to touch upon both 
<A NAME="695"></A>these points before we proceed to the rest of what we have to say, that 
<A NAME="696"></A>you may have a more correct idea of the grounds of our claim, and have 
<A NAME="697"></A>good cause to reject their petition. According to them, their old policy 
<A NAME="698"></A>of refusing all offers of alliance was a policy of moderation. It was in 
<A NAME="699"></A>fact adopted for bad ends, not for good; indeed their conduct is such as 
<A NAME="700"></A>to make them by no means desirous of having allies present to witness it, 
<A NAME="701"></A>or of having the shame of asking their concurrence. Besides, their geographical 
<A NAME="702"></A>situation makes them independent of others, and consequently the decision 
<A NAME="703"></A>in cases where they injure any lies not with judges appointed by mutual 
<A NAME="704"></A>agreement, but with themselves, because, while they seldom make voyages 
<A NAME="705"></A>to their neighbours, they are constantly being visited by foreign vessels 
<A NAME="706"></A>which are compelled to put in to Corcyra. In short, the object that they 
<A NAME="707"></A>propose to themselves, in their specious policy of complete isolation, 
<A NAME="708"></A>is not to avoid sharing in the crimes of others, but to secure monopoly 
<A NAME="709"></A>of crime to themselves- the licence of outrage wherever they can compel, 
<A NAME="710"></A>of fraud wherever they can elude, and the enjoyment of their gains without 
<A NAME="711"></A>shame. And yet if they were the honest men they pretend to be, the less 
<A NAME="712"></A>hold that others had upon them, the stronger would be the light in which 
<A NAME="713"></A>they might have put their honesty by giving and taking what was 
<A NAME="714"></A>just.
<A NAME="715"></A><BR><BR>"But such has not been their conduct either towards others or towards 
<A NAME="716"></A>us. The attitude of our colony towards us has always been one of estrangement 
<A NAME="717"></A>and is now one of hostility; for, say they: 'We were not sent out to be 
<A NAME="718"></A>ill-treated.' We rejoin that we did not found the colony to be insulted 
<A NAME="719"></A>by them, but to be their head and to be regarded with a proper respect. 
<A NAME="720"></A>At any rate our other colonies honour us, and we are much beloved by our 
<A NAME="721"></A>colonists; and clearly, if the majority are satisfied with us, these can 
<A NAME="722"></A>have no good reason for a dissatisfaction in which they stand alone, and 
<A NAME="723"></A>we are not acting improperly in making war against them, nor are we making 
<A NAME="724"></A>war against them without having received signal provocation. Besides, if 
<A NAME="725"></A>we were in the wrong, it would be honourable in them to give way to our 
<A NAME="726"></A>wishes, and disgraceful for us to trample on their moderation; but in the 
<A NAME="727"></A>pride and licence of wealth they have sinned again and again against us, 
<A NAME="728"></A>and never more deeply than when Epidamnus, our dependency, which they took 
<A NAME="729"></A>no steps to claim in its distress upon our coming to relieve it, was by 
<A NAME="730"></A>them seized, and is now held by force of arms.
<A NAME="731"></A><BR><BR>"As to their allegation that they wished the question to be first 
<A NAME="732"></A>submitted to arbitration, it is obvious that a challenge coming from the 
<A NAME="733"></A>party who is safe in a commanding position cannot gain the credit due only 
<A NAME="734"></A>to him who, before appealing to arms, in deeds as well as words, places 
<A NAME="735"></A>himself on a level with his adversary. In their case, it was not before 
<A NAME="736"></A>they laid siege to the place, but after they at length understood that 
<A NAME="737"></A>we should not tamely suffer it, that they thought of the specious word 
<A NAME="738"></A>arbitration. And not satisfied with their own misconduct there, they appear 
<A NAME="739"></A>here now requiring you to join with them not in alliance but in crime, 
<A NAME="740"></A>and to receive them in spite of their being at enmity with us. But it was 
<A NAME="741"></A>when they stood firmest that they should have made overtures to you, and 
<A NAME="742"></A>not at a time when we have been wronged and they are in peril; nor yet 
<A NAME="743"></A>at a time when you will be admitting to a share in your protection those 
<A NAME="744"></A>who never admitted you to a share in their power, and will be incurring 
<A NAME="745"></A>an equal amount of blame from us with those in whose offences you had no 
<A NAME="746"></A>hand. No, they should have shared their power with you before they asked 
<A NAME="747"></A>you to share your fortunes with them.
<A NAME="748"></A><BR><BR>"So then the reality of the grievances we come to complain of, 
<A NAME="749"></A>and the violence and rapacity of our opponents, have both been proved. 
<A NAME="750"></A>But that you cannot equitably receive them, this you have still to learn. 
<A NAME="751"></A>It may be true that one of the provisions of the treaty is that it shall 
<A NAME="752"></A>be competent for any state, whose name was not down on the list, to join 
<A NAME="753"></A>whichever side it pleases. But this agreement is not meant for those whose 
<A NAME="754"></A>object in joining is the injury of other powers, but for those whose need 
<A NAME="755"></A>of support does not arise from the fact of defection, and whose adhesion 
<A NAME="756"></A>will not bring to the power that is mad enough to receive them war instead 
<A NAME="757"></A>of peace; which will be the case with you, if you refuse to listen to us. 
<A NAME="758"></A>For you cannot become their auxiliary and remain our friend; if you join 
<A NAME="759"></A>in their attack, you must share the punishment which the defenders inflict 
<A NAME="760"></A>on them. And yet you have the best possible right to be neutral, or, failing 
<A NAME="761"></A>this, you should on the contrary join us against them. Corinth is at least 
<A NAME="762"></A>in treaty with you; with Corcyra you were never even in truce. But do not 
<A NAME="763"></A>lay down the principle that defection is to be patronized. Did we on the 
<A NAME="764"></A>defection of the Samians record our vote against you, when the rest of 
<A NAME="765"></A>the Peloponnesian powers were equally divided on the question whether they 
<A NAME="766"></A>should assist them? No, we told them to their face that every power has 
<A NAME="767"></A>a right to punish its own allies. Why, if you make it your policy to receive 
<A NAME="768"></A>and assist all offenders, you will find that just as many of your dependencies 
<A NAME="769"></A>will come over to us, and the principle that you establish will press less 
<A NAME="770"></A>heavily on us than on yourselves.
<A NAME="771"></A><BR><BR>"This then is what Hellenic law entitles us to demand as a right. 
<A NAME="772"></A>But we have also advice to offer and claims on your gratitude, which, since 
<A NAME="773"></A>there is no danger of our injuring you, as we are not enemies, and since 
<A NAME="774"></A>our friendship does not amount to very frequent intercourse, we say ought 
<A NAME="775"></A>to be liquidated at the present juncture. When you were in want of ships 
<A NAME="776"></A>of war for the war against the Aeginetans, before the Persian invasion, 
<A NAME="777"></A>Corinth supplied you with twenty vessels. That good turn, and the line 
<A NAME="778"></A>we took on the Samian question, when we were the cause of the Peloponnesians 
<A NAME="779"></A>refusing to assist them, enabled you to conquer Aegina and to punish Samos. 
<A NAME="780"></A>And we acted thus at crises when, if ever, men are wont in their efforts 
<A NAME="781"></A>against their enemies to forget everything for the sake of victory, regarding 
<A NAME="782"></A>him who assists them then as a friend, even if thus far he has been a foe, 
<A NAME="783"></A>and him who opposes them then as a foe, even if he has thus far been a 
<A NAME="784"></A>friend; indeed they allow their real interests to suffer from their absorbing 
<A NAME="785"></A>preoccupation in the struggle.
<A NAME="786"></A><BR><BR>"Weigh well these considerations, and let your youth learn what 
<A NAME="787"></A>they are from their elders, and let them determine to do unto us as we 
<A NAME="788"></A>have done unto you. And let them not acknowledge the justice of what we 
<A NAME="789"></A>say, but dispute its wisdom in the contingency of war. Not only is the 
<A NAME="790"></A>straightest path generally speaking the wisest; but the coming of the war, 
<A NAME="791"></A>which the Corcyraeans have used as a bugbear to persuade you to do wrong, 
<A NAME="792"></A>is still uncertain, and it is not worth while to be carried away by it 
<A NAME="793"></A>into gaining the instant and declared enmity of Corinth. It were, rather, 
<A NAME="794"></A>wise to try and counteract the unfavourable impression which your conduct 
<A NAME="795"></A>to Megara has created. For kindness opportunely shown has a greater power 
<A NAME="796"></A>of removing old grievances than the facts of the case may warrant. And 
<A NAME="797"></A>do not be seduced by the prospect of a great naval alliance. Abstinence 
<A NAME="798"></A>from all injustice to other first-rate powers is a greater tower of strength 
<A NAME="799"></A>than anything that can be gained by the sacrifice of permanent tranquillity 
<A NAME="800"></A>for an apparent temporary advantage. It is now our turn to benefit by the 
<A NAME="801"></A>principle that we laid down at Lacedaemon, that every power has a right 
<A NAME="802"></A>to punish her own allies. We now claim to receive the same from you, and 
<A NAME="803"></A>protest against your rewarding us for benefiting you by our vote by injuring 
<A NAME="804"></A>us by yours. On the contrary, return us like for like, remembering that 
<A NAME="805"></A>this is that very crisis in which he who lends aid is most a friend, and 
<A NAME="806"></A>he who opposes is most a foe. And for these Corcyraeans- neither receive 
<A NAME="807"></A>them into alliance in our despite, nor be their abettors in crime. So do, 
<A NAME="808"></A>and you will act as we have a right to expect of you, and at the same time 
<A NAME="809"></A>best consult your own interests."
<A NAME="810"></A><BR><BR>Such were the words of the Corinthians.
<A NAME="811"></A><BR><BR>When the Athenians had heard both out, two assemblies were held. 
<A NAME="812"></A>In the first there was a manifest disposition to listen to the representations 
<A NAME="813"></A>of Corinth; in the second, public feeling had changed and an alliance with 
<A NAME="814"></A>Corcyra was decided on, with certain reservations. It was to be a defensive, 
<A NAME="815"></A>not an offensive alliance. It did not involve a breach of the treaty with 
<A NAME="816"></A>Peloponnese: Athens could not be required to join Corcyra in any attack 
<A NAME="817"></A>upon Corinth. But each of the contracting parties had a right to the other's 
<A NAME="818"></A>assistance against invasion, whether of his own territory or that of an 
<A NAME="819"></A>ally. For it began now to be felt that the coming of the Peloponnesian 
<A NAME="820"></A>war was only a question of time, and no one was willing to see a naval 
<A NAME="821"></A>power of such magnitude as Corcyra sacrificed to Corinth; though if they 
<A NAME="822"></A>could let them weaken each other by mutual conflict, it would be no bad 
<A NAME="823"></A>preparation for the struggle which Athens might one day have to wage with 
<A NAME="824"></A>Corinth and the other naval powers. At the same time the island seemed 
<A NAME="825"></A>to lie conveniently on the coasting passage to Italy and Sicily. With these 
<A NAME="826"></A>views, Athens received Corcyra into alliance and, on the departure of the 
<A NAME="827"></A>Corinthians not long afterwards, sent ten ships to their assistance. They 
<A NAME="828"></A>were commanded by Lacedaemonius, the son of Cimon, Diotimus, the son of 
<A NAME="829"></A>Strombichus, and Proteas, the son of Epicles. Their instructions were to 
<A NAME="830"></A>avoid collision with the Corinthian fleet except under certain circumstances. 
<A NAME="831"></A>If it sailed to Corcyra and threatened a landing on her coast, or in any 
<A NAME="832"></A>of her possessions, they were to do their utmost to prevent it. These instructions 
<A NAME="833"></A>were prompted by an anxiety to avoid a breach of the 
<A NAME="834"></A>treaty.
<A NAME="835"></A><BR><BR>Meanwhile the Corinthians completed their preparations, and sailed 
<A NAME="836"></A>for Corcyra with a hundred and fifty ships. Of these Elis furnished ten, 
<A NAME="837"></A>Megara twelve, Leucas ten, Ambracia twenty-seven, Anactorium one, and Corinth 
<A NAME="838"></A>herself ninety. Each of these contingents had its own admiral, the Corinthian 
<A NAME="839"></A>being under the command of Xenoclides, son of Euthycles, with four colleagues. 
<A NAME="840"></A>Sailing from Leucas, they made land at the part of the continent opposite 
<A NAME="841"></A>Corcyra. They anchored in the harbour of Chimerium, in the territory of 
<A NAME="842"></A>Thesprotis, above which, at some distance from the sea, lies the city of 
<A NAME="843"></A>Ephyre, in the Elean district. By this city the Acherusian lake pours its 
<A NAME="844"></A>waters into the sea. It gets its name from the river Acheron, which flows 
<A NAME="845"></A>through Thesprotis and falls into the lake. There also the river Thyamis 
<A NAME="846"></A>flows, forming the boundary between Thesprotis and Kestrine; and between 
<A NAME="847"></A>these rivers rises the point of Chimerium. In this part of the continent 
<A NAME="848"></A>the Corinthians now came to anchor, and formed an encampment. When the 
<A NAME="849"></A>Corcyraeans saw them coming, they manned a hundred and ten ships, commanded 
<A NAME="850"></A>by Meikiades, Aisimides, and Eurybatus, and stationed themselves at one 
<A NAME="851"></A>of the Sybota isles; the ten Athenian ships being present. On Point Leukimme 
<A NAME="852"></A>they posted their land forces, and a thousand heavy infantry who had come 
<A NAME="853"></A>from Zacynthus to their assistance. Nor were the Corinthians on the mainland 
<A NAME="854"></A>without their allies. The barbarians flocked in large numbers to their 
<A NAME="855"></A>assistance, the inhabitants of this part of the continent being old allies 
<A NAME="856"></A>of theirs.
<A NAME="857"></A><BR><BR>When the Corinthian preparations were completed, they took three 
<A NAME="858"></A>days' provisions and put out from Chimerium by night, ready for action. 
<A NAME="859"></A>Sailing with the dawn, they sighted the Corcyraean fleet out at sea and 
<A NAME="860"></A>coming towards them. When they perceived each other, both sides formed 
<A NAME="861"></A>in order of battle. On the Corcyraean right wing lay the Athenian ships, 
<A NAME="862"></A>the rest of the line being occupied by their own vessels formed in three 
<A NAME="863"></A>squadrons, each of which was commanded by one of the three admirals. Such 
<A NAME="864"></A>was the Corcyraean formation. The Corinthian was as follows: on the right 
<A NAME="865"></A>wing lay the Megarian and Ambraciot ships, in the centre the rest of the 
<A NAME="866"></A>allies in order. But the left was composed of the best sailers in the Corinthian 
<A NAME="867"></A>navy, to encounter the Athenians and the right wing of the Corcyraeans. 
<A NAME="868"></A>As soon as the signals were raised on either side, they joined battle. 
<A NAME="869"></A>Both sides had a large number of heavy infantry on their decks, and a large 
<A NAME="870"></A>number of archers and darters, the old imperfect armament still prevailing. 
<A NAME="871"></A>The sea-fight was an obstinate one, though not remarkable for its science; 
<A NAME="872"></A>indeed it was more like a battle by land. Whenever they charged each other, 
<A NAME="873"></A>the multitude and crush of the vessels made it by no means easy to get 
<A NAME="874"></A>loose; besides, their hopes of victory lay principally in the heavy infantry 
<A NAME="875"></A>on the decks, who stood and fought in order, the ships remaining stationary. 
<A NAME="876"></A>The manoeuvre of breaking the line was not tried; in short, strength and 
<A NAME="877"></A>pluck had more share in the fight than science. Everywhere tumult reigned, 
<A NAME="878"></A>the battle being one scene of confusion; meanwhile the Athenian ships, 
<A NAME="879"></A>by coming up to the Corcyraeans whenever they were pressed, served to alarm 
<A NAME="880"></A>the enemy, though their commanders could not join in the battle from fear 
<A NAME="881"></A>of their instructions. The right wing of the Corinthians suffered most. 
<A NAME="882"></A>The Corcyraeans routed it, and chased them in disorder to the continent 
<A NAME="883"></A>with twenty ships, sailed up to their camp, and burnt the tents which they 
<A NAME="884"></A>found empty, and plundered the stuff. So in this quarter the Corinthians 
<A NAME="885"></A>and their allies were defeated, and the Corcyraeans were victorious. But 
<A NAME="886"></A>where the Corinthians themselves were, on the left, they gained a decided 
<A NAME="887"></A>success; the scanty forces of the Corcyraeans being further weakened by 
<A NAME="888"></A>the want of the twenty ships absent on the pursuit. Seeing the Corcyraeans 
<A NAME="889"></A>hard pressed, the Athenians began at length to assist them more unequivocally. 
<A NAME="890"></A>At first, it is true, they refrained from charging any ships; but when 
<A NAME="891"></A>the rout was becoming patent, and the Corinthians were pressing on, the 
<A NAME="892"></A>time at last came when every one set to, and all distinction was laid aside, 
<A NAME="893"></A>and it came to this point, that the Corinthians and Athenians raised their 
<A NAME="894"></A>hands against each other.
<A NAME="895"></A><BR><BR>After the rout, the Corinthians, instead of employing themselves 
<A NAME="896"></A>in lashing fast and hauling after them the hulls of the vessels which they 
<A NAME="897"></A>had disabled, turned their attention to the men, whom they butchered as 
<A NAME="898"></A>they sailed through, not caring so much to make prisoners. Some even of 
<A NAME="899"></A>their own friends were slain by them, by mistake, in their ignorance of 
<A NAME="900"></A>the defeat of the right wing For the number of the ships on both sides, 
<A NAME="901"></A>and the distance to which they covered the sea, made it difficult, after 
<A NAME="902"></A>they had once joined, to distinguish between the conquering and the conquered; 
<A NAME="903"></A>this battle proving far greater than any before it, any at least between 
<A NAME="904"></A>Hellenes, for the number of vessels engaged. After the Corinthians had 
<A NAME="905"></A>chased the Corcyraeans to the land, they turned to the wrecks and their 
<A NAME="906"></A>dead, most of whom they succeeded in getting hold of and conveying to Sybota, 
<A NAME="907"></A>the rendezvous of the land forces furnished by their barbarian allies. 
<A NAME="908"></A>Sybota, it must be known, is a desert harbour of Thesprotis. This task 
<A NAME="909"></A>over, they mustered anew, and sailed against the Corcyraeans, who on their 
<A NAME="910"></A>part advanced to meet them with all their ships that were fit for service 
<A NAME="911"></A>and remaining to them, accompanied by the Athenian vessels, fearing that 
<A NAME="912"></A>they might attempt a landing in their territory. It was by this time getting 
<A NAME="913"></A>late, and the paean had been sung for the attack, when the Corinthians 
<A NAME="914"></A>suddenly began to back water. They had observed twenty Athenian ships sailing 
<A NAME="915"></A>up, which had been sent out afterwards to reinforce the ten vessels by 
<A NAME="916"></A>the Athenians, who feared, as it turned out justly, the defeat of the Corcyraeans 
<A NAME="917"></A>and the inability of their handful of ships to protect them. These ships 
<A NAME="918"></A>were thus seen by the Corinthians first. They suspected that they were 
<A NAME="919"></A>from Athens, and that those which they saw were not all, but that there 
<A NAME="920"></A>were more behind; they accordingly began to retire. The Corcyraeans meanwhile 
<A NAME="921"></A>had not sighted them, as they were advancing from a point which they could 
<A NAME="922"></A>not so well see, and were wondering why the Corinthians were backing water, 
<A NAME="923"></A>when some caught sight of them, and cried out that there were ships in 
<A NAME="924"></A>sight ahead. Upon this they also retired; for it was now getting dark, 
<A NAME="925"></A>and the retreat of the Corinthians had suspended hostilities. Thus they 
<A NAME="926"></A>parted from each other, and the battle ceased with night. The Corcyraeans 
<A NAME="927"></A>were in their camp at Leukimme, when these twenty ships from Athens, under 
<A NAME="928"></A>the command of Glaucon, the son of Leagrus, and Andocides, son of Leogoras, 
<A NAME="929"></A>bore on through the corpses and the wrecks, and sailed up to the camp, 
<A NAME="930"></A>not long after they were sighted. It was now night, and the Corcyraeans 
<A NAME="931"></A>feared that they might be hostile vessels; but they soon knew them, and 
<A NAME="932"></A>the ships came to anchor.
<A NAME="933"></A><BR><BR>The next day the thirty Athenian vessels put out to sea, accompanied 
<A NAME="934"></A>by all the Corcyraean ships that were seaworthy, and sailed to the harbour 
<A NAME="935"></A>at Sybota, where the Corinthians lay, to see if they would engage. The 
<A NAME="936"></A>Corinthians put out from the land and formed a line in the open sea, but 
<A NAME="937"></A>beyond this made no further movement, having no intention of assuming the 
<A NAME="938"></A>offensive. For they saw reinforcements arrived fresh from Athens, and themselves 
<A NAME="939"></A>confronted by numerous difficulties, such as the necessity of guarding 
<A NAME="940"></A>the prisoners whom they had on board and the want of all means of refitting 
<A NAME="941"></A>their ships in a desert place. What they were thinking more about was how 
<A NAME="942"></A>their voyage home was to be effected; they feared that the Athenians might 
<A NAME="943"></A>consider that the treaty was dissolved by the collision which had occurred, 
<A NAME="944"></A>and forbid their departure.
<A NAME="945"></A><BR><BR>Accordingly they resolved to put some men on board a boat, and 
<A NAME="946"></A>send them without a herald's wand to the Athenians, as an experiment. Having 
<A NAME="947"></A>done so, they spoke as follows: "You do wrong, Athenians, to begin war 
<A NAME="948"></A>and break the treaty. Engaged in chastising our enemies, we find you placing 
<A NAME="949"></A>yourselves in our path in arms against us. Now if your intentions are to 
<A NAME="950"></A>prevent us sailing to Corcyra, or anywhere else that we may wish, and if 
<A NAME="951"></A>you are for breaking the treaty, first take us that are here and treat 
<A NAME="952"></A>us as enemies." Such was what they said, and all the Corcyraean armament 
<A NAME="953"></A>that were within hearing immediately called out to take them and kill them. 
<A NAME="954"></A>But the Athenians answered as follows: "Neither are we beginning war, Peloponnesians, 
<A NAME="955"></A>nor are we breaking the treaty; but these Corcyraeans are our allies, and 
<A NAME="956"></A>we are come to help them. So if you want to sail anywhere else, we place 
<A NAME="957"></A>no obstacle in your way; but if you are going to sail against Corcyra, 
<A NAME="958"></A>or any of her possessions, we shall do our best to stop 
<A NAME="959"></A>you."
<A NAME="960"></A><BR><BR>Receiving this answer from the Athenians, the Corinthians commenced 
<A NAME="961"></A>preparations for their voyage home, and set up a trophy in Sybota, on the 
<A NAME="962"></A>continent; while the Corcyraeans took up the wrecks and dead that had been 
<A NAME="963"></A>carried out to them by the current, and by a wind which rose in the night 
<A NAME="964"></A>and scattered them in all directions, and set up their trophy in Sybota, 
<A NAME="965"></A>on the island, as victors. The reasons each side had for claiming the victory 
<A NAME="966"></A>were these. The Corinthians had been victorious in the sea-fight until 
<A NAME="967"></A>night; and having thus been enabled to carry off most wrecks and dead, 
<A NAME="968"></A>they were in possession of no fewer than a thousand prisoners of war, and 
<A NAME="969"></A>had sunk close upon seventy vessels. The Corcyraeans had destroyed about 
<A NAME="970"></A>thirty ships, and after the arrival of the Athenians had taken up the wrecks 
<A NAME="971"></A>and dead on their side; they had besides seen the Corinthians retire before 
<A NAME="972"></A>them, backing water on sight of the Athenian vessels, and upon the arrival 
<A NAME="973"></A>of the Athenians refuse to sail out against them from Sybota. Thus both 
<A NAME="974"></A>sides claimed the victory.
<A NAME="975"></A><BR><BR>The Corinthians on the voyage home took Anactorium, which stands 
<A NAME="976"></A>at the mouth of the Ambracian gulf. The place was taken by treachery, being 
<A NAME="977"></A>common ground to the Corcyraeans and Corinthians. After establishing Corinthian 
<A NAME="978"></A>settlers there, they retired home. Eight hundred of the Corcyraeans were 
<A NAME="979"></A>slaves; these they sold; two hundred and fifty they retained in captivity, 
<A NAME="980"></A>and treated with great attention, in the hope that they might bring over 
<A NAME="981"></A>their country to Corinth on their return; most of them being, as it happened, 
<A NAME="982"></A>men of very high position in Corcyra. In this way Corcyra maintained her 
<A NAME="983"></A>political existence in the war with Corinth, and the Athenian vessels left 
<A NAME="984"></A>the island. This was the first cause of the war that Corinth had against 
<A NAME="985"></A>the Athenians, viz., that they had fought against them with the Corcyraeans 
<A NAME="986"></A>in time of treaty.
<A NAME="987"></A><BR><BR>Almost immediately after this, fresh differences arose between 
<A NAME="988"></A>the Athenians and Peloponnesians, and contributed their share to the war. 
<A NAME="989"></A>Corinth was forming schemes for retaliation, and Athens suspected her hostility. 
<A NAME="990"></A>The Potidaeans, who inhabit the isthmus of Pallene, being a Corinthian 
<A NAME="991"></A>colony, but tributary allies of Athens, were ordered to raze the wall looking 
<A NAME="992"></A>towards Pallene, to give hostages, to dismiss the Corinthian magistrates, 
<A NAME="993"></A>and in future not to receive the persons sent from Corinth annually to 
<A NAME="994"></A>succeed them. It was feared that they might be persuaded by Perdiccas and 
<A NAME="995"></A>the Corinthians to revolt, and might draw the rest of the allies in the 
<A NAME="996"></A>direction of Thrace to revolt with them. These precautions against the 
<A NAME="997"></A>Potidaeans were taken by the Athenians immediately after the battle at 
<A NAME="998"></A>Corcyra. Not only was Corinth at length openly hostile, but Perdiccas, 
<A NAME="999"></A>son of Alexander, king of the Macedonians, had from an old friend and ally 
<A NAME="1000"></A>been made an enemy. He had been made an enemy by the Athenians entering 
<A NAME="1001"></A>into alliance with his brother Philip and Derdas, who were in league against 
<A NAME="1002"></A>him. In his alarm he had sent to Lacedaemon to try and involve the Athenians 
<A NAME="1003"></A>in a war with the Peloponnesians, and was endeavouring to win over Corinth 
<A NAME="1004"></A>in order to bring about the revolt of Potidaea. He also made overtures 
<A NAME="1005"></A>to the Chalcidians in the direction of Thrace, and to the Bottiaeans, to 
<A NAME="1006"></A>persuade them to join in the revolt; for he thought that if these places 
<A NAME="1007"></A>on the border could be made his allies, it would be easier to carry on 
<A NAME="1008"></A>the war with their co-operation. Alive to all this, and wishing to anticipate 
<A NAME="1009"></A>the revolt of the cities, the Athenians acted as follows. They were just 
<A NAME="1010"></A>then sending off thirty ships and a thousand heavy infantry for his country 
<A NAME="1011"></A>under the command of Archestratus, son of Lycomedes, with four colleagues. 
<A NAME="1012"></A>They instructed the captains to take hostages of the Potidaeans, to raze 
<A NAME="1013"></A>the wall, and to be on their guard against the revolt of the neighbouring 
<A NAME="1014"></A>cities.
<A NAME="1015"></A><BR><BR>Meanwhile the Potidaeans sent envoys to Athens on the chance of 
<A NAME="1016"></A>persuading them to take no new steps in their matters; they also went to 
<A NAME="1017"></A>Lacedaemon with the Corinthians to secure support in case of need. Failing 
<A NAME="1018"></A>after prolonged negotiation to obtain anything satisfactory from the Athenians; 
<A NAME="1019"></A>being unable, for all they could say, to prevent the vessels that were 
<A NAME="1020"></A>destined for Macedonia from also sailing against them; and receiving from 
<A NAME="1021"></A>the Lacedaemonian government a promise to invade Attica, if the Athenians 
<A NAME="1022"></A>should attack Potidaea, the Potidaeans, thus favoured by the moment, at 
<A NAME="1023"></A>last entered into league with the Chalcidians and Bottiaeans, and revolted. 
<A NAME="1024"></A>And Perdiccas induced the Chalcidians to abandon and demolish their towns 
<A NAME="1025"></A>on the seaboard and, settling inland at Olynthus, to make that one city 
<A NAME="1026"></A>a strong place: meanwhile to those who followed his advice he gave a part 
<A NAME="1027"></A>of his territory in Mygdonia round Lake Bolbe as a place of abode while 
<A NAME="1028"></A>the war against the Athenians should last. They accordingly demolished 
<A NAME="1029"></A>their towns, removed inland and prepared for war. The thirty ships of the 
<A NAME="1030"></A>Athenians, arriving before the Thracian places, found Potidaea and the 
<A NAME="1031"></A>rest in revolt. Their commanders, considering it to be quite impossible 
<A NAME="1032"></A>with their present force to carry on war with Perdiccas and with the confederate 
<A NAME="1033"></A>towns as well turned to Macedonia, their original destination, and, having 
<A NAME="1034"></A>established themselves there, carried on war in co-operation with Philip, 
<A NAME="1035"></A>and the brothers of Derdas, who had invaded the country from the 
<A NAME="1036"></A>interior.
<A NAME="1037"></A><BR><BR>Meanwhile the Corinthians, with Potidaea in revolt and the Athenian 
<A NAME="1038"></A>ships on the coast of Macedonia, alarmed for the safety of the place and 
<A NAME="1039"></A>thinking its danger theirs, sent volunteers from Corinth, and mercenaries 
<A NAME="1040"></A>from the rest of Peloponnese, to the number of sixteen hundred heavy infantry 
<A NAME="1041"></A>in all, and four hundred light troops. Aristeus, son of Adimantus, who 
<A NAME="1042"></A>was always a steady friend to the Potidaeans, took command of the expedition, 
<A NAME="1043"></A>and it was principally for love of him that most of the men from Corinth 
<A NAME="1044"></A>volunteered. They arrived in Thrace forty days after the revolt of 
<A NAME="1045"></A>Potidaea.
<A NAME="1046"></A><BR><BR>The Athenians also immediately received the news of the revolt 
<A NAME="1047"></A>of the cities. On being informed that Aristeus and his reinforcements were 
<A NAME="1048"></A>on their way, they sent two thousand heavy infantry of their own citizens 
<A NAME="1049"></A>and forty ships against the places in revolt, under the command of Callias, 
<A NAME="1050"></A>son of Calliades, and four colleagues. They arrived in Macedonia first, 
<A NAME="1051"></A>and found the force of a thousand men that had been first sent out, just 
<A NAME="1052"></A>become masters of Therme and besieging Pydna. Accordingly they also joined 
<A NAME="1053"></A>in the investment, and besieged Pydna for a while. Subsequently they came 
<A NAME="1054"></A>to terms and concluded a forced alliance with Perdiccas, hastened by the 
<A NAME="1055"></A>calls of Potidaea and by the arrival of Aristeus at that place. They withdrew 
<A NAME="1056"></A>from Macedonia, going to Beroea and thence to Strepsa, and, after a futile 
<A NAME="1057"></A>attempt on the latter place, they pursued by land their march to Potidaea 
<A NAME="1058"></A>with three thousand heavy infantry of their own citizens, besides a number 
<A NAME="1059"></A>of their allies, and six hundred Macedonian horsemen, the followers of 
<A NAME="1060"></A>Philip and Pausanias. With these sailed seventy ships along the coast. 
<A NAME="1061"></A>Advancing by short marches, on the third day they arrived at Gigonus, where 
<A NAME="1062"></A>they encamped.
<A NAME="1063"></A><BR><BR>Meanwhile the Potidaeans and the Peloponnesians with Aristeus were 
<A NAME="1064"></A>encamped on the side looking towards Olynthus on the isthmus, in expectation 
<A NAME="1065"></A>of the Athenians, and had established their market outside the city. The 
<A NAME="1066"></A>allies had chosen Aristeus general of all the infantry; while the command 
<A NAME="1067"></A>of the cavalry was given to Perdiccas, who had at once left the alliance 
<A NAME="1068"></A>of the Athenians and gone back to that of the Potidaeans, having deputed 
<A NAME="1069"></A>Iolaus as his general: The plan of Aristeus was to keep his own force on 
<A NAME="1070"></A>the isthmus, and await the attack of the Athenians; leaving the Chalcidians 
<A NAME="1071"></A>and the allies outside the isthmus, and the two hundred cavalry from Perdiccas 
<A NAME="1072"></A>in Olynthus to act upon the Athenian rear, on the occasion of their advancing 
<A NAME="1073"></A>against him; and thus to place the enemy between two fires. While Callias 
<A NAME="1074"></A>the Athenian general and his colleagues dispatched the Macedonian horse 
<A NAME="1075"></A>and a few of the allies to Olynthus, to prevent any movement being made 
<A NAME="1076"></A>from that quarter, the Athenians themselves broke up their camp and marched 
<A NAME="1077"></A>against P
