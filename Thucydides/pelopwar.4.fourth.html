<A NAME="10"></A><B>Chapter XII</B>
<A NAME="11"></A><BR><BR><B>Seventh Year of the War - Occupation of Pylos -</B> <B>Surrender 
<A NAME="12"></A>of the Spartan Army in Sphacteria</B>
<A NAME="13"></A><BR><BR>Next summer, about the time of the corn's coming into ear, ten 
<A NAME="14"></A>Syracusan and as many Locrian vessels sailed to Messina, in Sicily, and 
<A NAME="15"></A>occupied the town upon the invitation of the inhabitants; and Messina revolted 
<A NAME="16"></A>from the Athenians. The Syracusans contrived this chiefly because they 
<A NAME="17"></A>saw that the place afforded an approach to Sicily, and feared that the 
<A NAME="18"></A>Athenians might hereafter use it as a base for attacking them with a larger 
<A NAME="19"></A>force; the Locrians because they wished to carry on hostilities from both 
<A NAME="20"></A>sides of the strait and to reduce their enemies, the people of Rhegium. 
<A NAME="21"></A>Meanwhile, the Locrians had invaded the Rhegian territory with all their 
<A NAME="22"></A>forces, to prevent their succouring Messina, and also at the instance of 
<A NAME="23"></A>some exiles from Rhegium who were with them; the long factions by which 
<A NAME="24"></A>that town had been torn rendering it for the moment incapable of resistance, 
<A NAME="25"></A>and thus furnishing an additional temptation to the invaders. After devastating 
<A NAME="26"></A>the country the Locrian land forces retired, their ships remaining to guard 
<A NAME="27"></A>Messina, while others were being manned for the same destination to carry 
<A NAME="28"></A>on the war from thence.
<A NAME="29"></A><BR><BR>About the same time in the spring, before the corn was ripe, the 
<A NAME="30"></A>Peloponnesians and their allies invaded Attica under Agis, the son of Archidamus, 
<A NAME="31"></A>king of the Lacedaemonians, and sat down and laid waste the country. Meanwhile 
<A NAME="32"></A>the Athenians sent off the forty ships which they had been preparing to 
<A NAME="33"></A>Sicily, with the remaining generals Eurymedon and Sophocles; their colleague 
<A NAME="34"></A>Pythodorus having already preceded them thither. These had also instructions 
<A NAME="35"></A>as they sailed by to look to the Corcyraeans in the town, who were being 
<A NAME="36"></A>plundered by the exiles in the mountain. To support these exiles sixty 
<A NAME="37"></A>Peloponnesian vessels had lately sailed, it being thought that the famine 
<A NAME="38"></A>raging in the city would make it easy for them to reduce it. Demosthenes 
<A NAME="39"></A>also, who had remained without employment since his return from Acarnania, 
<A NAME="40"></A>applied and obtained permission to use the fleet, if he wished it, upon 
<A NAME="41"></A>the coast of Peloponnese.
<A NAME="42"></A><BR><BR>Off Laconia they heard that the Peloponnesian ships were already 
<A NAME="43"></A>at Corcyra, upon which Eurymedon and Sophocles wished to hasten to the 
<A NAME="44"></A>island, but Demosthenes required them first to touch at Pylos and do what 
<A NAME="45"></A>was wanted there, before continuing their voyage. While they were making 
<A NAME="46"></A>objections, a squall chanced to come on and carried the fleet into Pylos. 
<A NAME="47"></A>Demosthenes at once urged them to fortify the place, it being for this 
<A NAME="48"></A>that he had come on the voyage, and made them observe there was plenty 
<A NAME="49"></A>of stone and timber on the spot, and that the place was strong by nature, 
<A NAME="50"></A>and together with much of the country round unoccupied; Pylos, or Coryphasium, 
<A NAME="51"></A>as the Lacedaemonians call it, being about forty-five miles distant from 
<A NAME="52"></A>Sparta, and situated in the old country of the Messenians. The commanders 
<A NAME="53"></A>told him that there was no lack of desert headlands in Peloponnese if he 
<A NAME="54"></A>wished to put the city to expense by occupying them. He, however, thought 
<A NAME="55"></A>that this place was distinguished from others of the kind by having a harbour 
<A NAME="56"></A>close by; while the Messenians, the old natives of the country, speaking 
<A NAME="57"></A>the same dialect as the Lacedaemonians, could do them the greatest mischief 
<A NAME="58"></A>by their incursions from it, and would at the same time be a trusty 
<A NAME="59"></A>garrison.
<A NAME="60"></A><BR><BR>After speaking to the captains of companies on the subject, and 
<A NAME="61"></A>failing to persuade either the generals or the soldiers, he remained inactive 
<A NAME="62"></A>with the rest from stress of weather; until the soldiers themselves wanting 
<A NAME="63"></A>occupation were seized with a sudden impulse to go round and fortify the 
<A NAME="64"></A>place. Accordingly they set to work in earnest, and having no iron tools, 
<A NAME="65"></A>picked up stones, and put them together as they happened to fit, and where 
<A NAME="66"></A>mortar was needed, carried it on their backs for want of hods, stooping 
<A NAME="67"></A>down to make it stay on, and clasping their hands together behind to prevent 
<A NAME="68"></A>it falling off; sparing no effort to be able to complete the most vulnerable 
<A NAME="69"></A>points before the arrival of the Lacedaemonians, most of the place being 
<A NAME="70"></A>sufficiently strong by nature without further fortifications.
<A NAME="71"></A><BR><BR>Meanwhile the Lacedaemonians were celebrating a festival, and also 
<A NAME="72"></A>at first made light of the news, in the idea that whenever they chose to 
<A NAME="73"></A>take the field the place would be immediately evacuated by the enemy or 
<A NAME="74"></A>easily taken by force; the absence of their army before Athens having also 
<A NAME="75"></A>something to do with their delay. The Athenians fortified the place on 
<A NAME="76"></A>the land side, and where it most required it, in six days, and leaving 
<A NAME="77"></A>Demosthenes with five ships to garrison it, with the main body of the fleet 
<A NAME="78"></A>hastened on their voyage to Corcyra and Sicily.
<A NAME="79"></A><BR><BR>As soon as the Peloponnesians in Attica heard of the occupation 
<A NAME="80"></A>of Pylos, they hurried back home; the Lacedaemonians and their king Agis 
<A NAME="81"></A>thinking that the matter touched them nearly. Besides having made their 
<A NAME="82"></A>invasion early in the season, and while the corn was still green, most 
<A NAME="83"></A>of their troops were short of provisions: the weather also was unusually 
<A NAME="84"></A>bad for the time of year, and greatly distressed their army. Many reasons 
<A NAME="85"></A>thus combined to hasten their departure and to make this invasion a very 
<A NAME="86"></A>short one; indeed they only stayed fifteen days in Attica.
<A NAME="87"></A><BR><BR>About the same time the Athenian general Simonides getting together 
<A NAME="88"></A>a few Athenians from the garrisons, and a number of the allies in those 
<A NAME="89"></A>parts, took Eion in Thrace, a Mendaean colony and hostile to Athens, by 
<A NAME="90"></A>treachery, but had no sooner done so than the Chalcidians and Bottiaeans 
<A NAME="91"></A>came up and beat him out of it, with the loss of many of his 
<A NAME="92"></A>soldiers.
<A NAME="93"></A><BR><BR>On the return of the Peloponnesians from Attica, the Spartans themselves 
<A NAME="94"></A>and the nearest of the Perioeci at once set out for Pylos, the other Lacedaemonians 
<A NAME="95"></A>following more slowly, as they had just come in from another campaign. 
<A NAME="96"></A>Word was also sent round Peloponnese to come up as quickly as possible 
<A NAME="97"></A>to Pylos; while the sixty Peloponnesian ships were sent for from Corcyra, 
<A NAME="98"></A>and being dragged by their crews across the isthmus of Leucas, passed unperceived 
<A NAME="99"></A>by the Athenian squadron at Zacynthus, and reached Pylos, where the land 
<A NAME="100"></A>forces had arrived before them. Before the Peloponnesian fleet sailed in, 
<A NAME="101"></A>Demosthenes found time to send out unobserved two ships to inform Eurymedon 
<A NAME="102"></A>and the Athenians on board the fleet at Zacynthus of the danger of Pylos 
<A NAME="103"></A>and to summon them to his assistance. While the ships hastened on their 
<A NAME="104"></A>voyage in obedience to the orders of Demosthenes, the Lacedaemonians prepared 
<A NAME="105"></A>to assault the fort by land and sea, hoping to capture with ease a work 
<A NAME="106"></A>constructed in haste, and held by a feeble garrison. Meanwhile, as they 
<A NAME="107"></A>expected the Athenian ships to arrive from Zacynthus, they intended, if 
<A NAME="108"></A>they failed to take the place before, to block up the entrances of the 
<A NAME="109"></A>harbour to prevent their being able to anchor inside it. For the island 
<A NAME="110"></A>of Sphacteria, stretching along in a line close in front of the harbour, 
<A NAME="111"></A>at once makes it safe and narrows its entrances, leaving a passage for 
<A NAME="112"></A>two ships on the side nearest Pylos and the Athenian fortifications, and 
<A NAME="113"></A>for eight or nine on that next the rest of the mainland: for the rest, 
<A NAME="114"></A>the island was entirely covered with wood, and without paths through not 
<A NAME="115"></A>being inhabited, and about one mile and five furlongs in length. The inlets 
<A NAME="116"></A>the Lacedaemonians meant to close with a line of ships placed close together, 
<A NAME="117"></A>with their prows turned towards the sea, and, meanwhile, fearing that the 
<A NAME="118"></A>enemy might make use of the island to operate against them, carried over 
<A NAME="119"></A>some heavy infantry thither, stationing others along the coast. By this 
<A NAME="120"></A>means the island and the continent would be alike hostile to the Athenians, 
<A NAME="121"></A>as they would be unable to land on either; and the shore of Pylos itself 
<A NAME="122"></A>outside the inlet towards the open sea having no harbour, and, therefore, 
<A NAME="123"></A>presenting no point which they could use as a base to relieve their countrymen, 
<A NAME="124"></A>they, the Lacedaemonians, without sea-fight or risk would in all probability 
<A NAME="125"></A>become masters of the place, occupied as it had been on the spur of the 
<A NAME="126"></A>moment, and unfurnished with provisions. This being determined, they carried 
<A NAME="127"></A>over to the island the heavy infantry, drafted by lot from all the companies. 
<A NAME="128"></A>Some others had crossed over before in relief parties, but these last who 
<A NAME="129"></A>were left there were four hundred and twenty in number, with their Helot 
<A NAME="130"></A>attendants, commanded by Epitadas, son of Molobrus.
<A NAME="131"></A><BR><BR>Meanwhile Demosthenes, seeing the Lacedaemonians about to attack 
<A NAME="132"></A>him by sea and land at once, himself was not idle. He drew up under the 
<A NAME="133"></A>fortification and enclosed in a stockade the galleys remaining to him of 
<A NAME="134"></A>those which had been left him, arming the sailors taken out of them with 
<A NAME="135"></A>poor shields made most of them of osier, it being impossible to procure 
<A NAME="136"></A>arms in such a desert place, and even these having been obtained from a 
<A NAME="137"></A>thirty-oared Messenian privateer and a boat belonging to some Messenians 
<A NAME="138"></A>who happened to have come to them. Among these Messenians were forty heavy 
<A NAME="139"></A>infantry, whom he made use of with the rest. Posting most of his men, unarmed 
<A NAME="140"></A>and armed, upon the best fortified and strong points of the place towards 
<A NAME="141"></A>the interior, with orders to repel any attack of the land forces, he picked 
<A NAME="142"></A>sixty heavy infantry and a few archers from his whole force, and with these 
<A NAME="143"></A>went outside the wall down to the sea, where he thought that the enemy 
<A NAME="144"></A>would most likely attempt to land. Although the ground was difficult and 
<A NAME="145"></A>rocky, looking towards the open sea, the fact that this was the weakest 
<A NAME="146"></A>part of the wall would, he thought, encourage their ardour, as the Athenians, 
<A NAME="147"></A>confident in their naval superiority, had here paid little attention to 
<A NAME="148"></A>their defences, and the enemy if he could force a landing might feel secure 
<A NAME="149"></A>of taking the place. At this point, accordingly, going down to the water's 
<A NAME="150"></A>edge, he posted his heavy infantry to prevent, if possible, a landing, 
<A NAME="151"></A>and encouraged them in the following terms:
<A NAME="152"></A><BR><BR>"Soldiers and comrades in this adventure, I hope that none of you 
<A NAME="153"></A>in our present strait will think to show his wit by exactly calculating 
<A NAME="154"></A>all the perils that encompass us, but that you will rather hasten to close 
<A NAME="155"></A>with the enemy, without staying to count the odds, seeing in this your 
<A NAME="156"></A>best chance of safety. In emergencies like ours calculation is out of place; 
<A NAME="157"></A>the sooner the danger is faced the better. To my mind also most of the 
<A NAME="158"></A>chances are for us, if we will only stand fast and not throw away our advantages, 
<A NAME="159"></A>overawed by the numbers of the enemy. One of the points in our favour is 
<A NAME="160"></A>the awkwardness of the landing. This, however, only helps us if we stand 
<A NAME="161"></A>our ground. If we give way it will be practicable enough, in spite of its 
<A NAME="162"></A>natural difficulty, without a defender; and the enemy will instantly become 
<A NAME="163"></A>more formidable from the difficulty he will have in retreating, supposing 
<A NAME="164"></A>that we succeed in repulsing him, which we shall find it easier to do, 
<A NAME="165"></A>while he is on board his ships, than after he has landed and meets us on 
<A NAME="166"></A>equal terms. As to his numbers, these need not too much alarm you. Large 
<A NAME="167"></A>as they may be he can only engage in small detachments, from the impossibility 
<A NAME="168"></A>of bringing to. Besides, the numerical superiority that we have to meet 
<A NAME="169"></A>is not that of an army on land with everything else equal, but of troops 
<A NAME="170"></A>on board ship, upon an element where many favourable accidents are required 
<A NAME="171"></A>to act with effect. I therefore consider that his difficulties may be fairly 
<A NAME="172"></A>set against our numerical deficiencies, and at the same time I charge you, 
<A NAME="173"></A>as Athenians who know by experience what landing from ships on a hostile 
<A NAME="174"></A>territory means, and how impossible it is to drive back an enemy determined 
<A NAME="175"></A>enough to stand his ground and not to be frightened away by the surf and 
<A NAME="176"></A>the terrors of the ships sailing in, to stand fast in the present emergency, 
<A NAME="177"></A>beat back the enemy at the water's edge, and save yourselves and the 
<A NAME="178"></A>place."
<A NAME="179"></A><BR><BR>Thus encouraged by Demosthenes, the Athenians felt more confident, 
<A NAME="180"></A>and went down to meet the enemy, posting themselves along the edge of the 
<A NAME="181"></A>sea. The Lacedaemonians now put themselves in movement and simultaneously 
<A NAME="182"></A>assaulted the fortification with their land forces and with their ships, 
<A NAME="183"></A>forty-three in number, under their admiral, Thrasymelidas, son of Cratesicles, 
<A NAME="184"></A>a Spartan, who made his attack just where Demosthenes expected. The Athenians 
<A NAME="185"></A>had thus to defend themselves on both sides, from the land and from the 
<A NAME="186"></A>sea; the enemy rowing up in small detachments, the one relieving the other- 
<A NAME="187"></A>it being impossible for many to bring to at once- and showing great ardour 
<A NAME="188"></A>and cheering each other on, in the endeavour to force a passage and to 
<A NAME="189"></A>take the fortification. He who most distinguished himself was Brasidas. 
<A NAME="190"></A>Captain of a galley, and seeing that the captains and steersmen, impressed 
<A NAME="191"></A>by the difficulty of the position, hung back even where a landing might 
<A NAME="192"></A>have seemed possible, for fear of wrecking their vessels, he shouted out 
<A NAME="193"></A>to them, that they must never allow the enemy to fortify himself in their 
<A NAME="194"></A>country for the sake of saving timber, but must shiver their vessels and 
<A NAME="195"></A>force a landing; and bade the allies, instead of hesitating in such a moment 
<A NAME="196"></A>to sacrifice their ships for Lacedaemon in return for her many benefits, 
<A NAME="197"></A>to run them boldly aground, land in one way or another, and make themselves 
<A NAME="198"></A>masters of the place and its garrison.
<A NAME="199"></A><BR><BR>Not content with this exhortation, he forced his own steersman 
<A NAME="200"></A>to run his ship ashore, and stepping on to the gangway, was endeavouring 
<A NAME="201"></A>to land, when he was cut down by the Athenians, and after receiving many 
<A NAME="202"></A>wounds fainted away. Falling into the bows, his shield slipped off his 
<A NAME="203"></A>arm into the sea, and being thrown ashore was picked up by the Athenians, 
<A NAME="204"></A>and afterwards used for the trophy which they set up for this attack. The 
<A NAME="205"></A>rest also did their best, but were not able to land, owing to the difficulty 
<A NAME="206"></A>of the ground and the unflinching tenacity of the Athenians. It was a strange 
<A NAME="207"></A>reversal of the order of things for Athenians to be fighting from the land, 
<A NAME="208"></A>and from Laconian land too, against Lacedaemonians coming from the sea; 
<A NAME="209"></A>while Lacedaemonians were trying to land from shipboard in their own country, 
<A NAME="210"></A>now become hostile, to attack Athenians, although the former were chiefly 
<A NAME="211"></A>famous at the time as an inland people and superior by land, the latter 
<A NAME="212"></A>as a maritime people with a navy that had no equal.
<A NAME="213"></A><BR><BR>After continuing their attacks during that day and most of the 
<A NAME="214"></A>next, the Peloponnesians desisted, and the day after sent some of their 
<A NAME="215"></A>ships to Asine for timber to make engines, hoping to take by their aid, 
<A NAME="216"></A>in spite of its height, the wall opposite the harbour, where the landing 
<A NAME="217"></A>was easiest. At this moment the Athenian fleet from Zacynthus arrived, 
<A NAME="218"></A>now numbering fifty sail, having been reinforced by some of the ships on 
<A NAME="219"></A>guard at Naupactus and by four Chian vessels. Seeing the coast and the 
<A NAME="220"></A>island both crowded with heavy infantry, and the hostile ships in harbour 
<A NAME="221"></A>showing no signs of sailing out, at a loss where to anchor, they sailed 
<A NAME="222"></A>for the moment to the desert island of Prote, not far off, where they passed 
<A NAME="223"></A>the night. The next day they got under way in readiness to engage in the 
<A NAME="224"></A>open sea if the enemy chose to put out to meet them, being determined in 
<A NAME="225"></A>the event of his not doing so to sail in and attack him. The Lacedaemonians 
<A NAME="226"></A>did not put out to sea, and having omitted to close the inlets as they 
<A NAME="227"></A>had intended, remained quiet on shore, engaged in manning their ships and 
<A NAME="228"></A>getting ready, in the case of any one sailing in, to fight in the harbour, 
<A NAME="229"></A>which is a fairly large one.
<A NAME="230"></A><BR><BR>Perceiving this, the Athenians advanced against them by each inlet, 
<A NAME="231"></A>and falling on the enemy's fleet, most of which was by this time afloat 
<A NAME="232"></A>and in line, at once put it to flight, and giving chase as far as the short 
<A NAME="233"></A>distance allowed, disabled a good many vessels and took five, one with 
<A NAME="234"></A>its crew on board; dashing in at the rest that had taken refuge on shore, 
<A NAME="235"></A>and battering some that were still being manned, before they could put 
<A NAME="236"></A>out, and lashing on to their own ships and towing off empty others whosc 
<A NAME="237"></A>crews had fled. At this sight the Lacedaemonians, maddened by a disaster 
<A NAME="238"></A>which cut off their men on the island, rushed to the rescue, and going 
<A NAME="239"></A>into the sea with their heavy armour, laid hold of the ships and tried 
<A NAME="240"></A>to drag them back, each man thinking that success depended on his individual 
<A NAME="241"></A>exertions. Great was the melee, and quite in contradiction to the naval 
<A NAME="242"></A>tactics usual to the two combatants; the Lacedaemonians in their excitement 
<A NAME="243"></A>and dismay being actually engaged in a sea-fight on land, while the victorious 
<A NAME="244"></A>Athenians, in their eagerness to push their success as far as possible, 
<A NAME="245"></A>were carrying on a land-fight from their ships. After great exertions and 
<A NAME="246"></A>numerous wounds on both sides they separated, the Lacedaemonians saving 
<A NAME="247"></A>their empty ships, except those first taken; and both parties returning 
<A NAME="248"></A>to their camp, the Athenians set up a trophy, gave back the dead, secured 
<A NAME="249"></A>the wrecks, and at once began to cruise round and jealously watch the island, 
<A NAME="250"></A>with its intercepted garrison, while the Peloponnesians on the mainland, 
<A NAME="251"></A>whose contingents had now all come up, stayed where they were before 
<A NAME="252"></A>Pylos.
<A NAME="253"></A><BR><BR>When the news of what had happened at Pylos reached Sparta, the 
<A NAME="254"></A>disaster was thought so serious that the Lacedaemonians resolved that the 
<A NAME="255"></A>authorities should go down to the camp, and decide on the spot what was 
<A NAME="256"></A>best to be done. There, seeing that it was impossible to help their men, 
<A NAME="257"></A>and not wishing to risk their being reduced by hunger or overpowered by 
<A NAME="258"></A>numbers, they determined, with the consent of the Athenian generals, to 
<A NAME="259"></A>conclude an armistice at Pylos and send envoys to Athens to obtain a convention, 
<A NAME="260"></A>and to endeavour to get back their men as quickly as 
<A NAME="261"></A>possible.
<A NAME="262"></A><BR><BR>The generals accepting their offers, an armistice was concluded 
<A NAME="263"></A>upon the terms following:
<A NAME="264"></A><BR><BR>That the Lacedaemonians should bring to Pylos and deliver up to 
<A NAME="265"></A>the Athenians the ships that had fought in the late engagement, and all 
<A NAME="266"></A>in Laconia that were vessels of war, and should make no attack on the fortification 
<A NAME="267"></A>either by land or by sea.
<A NAME="268"></A><BR><BR>That the Athenians should allow the Lacedaemonians on the mainland 
<A NAME="269"></A>to send to the men in the island a certain fixed quantity of corn ready 
<A NAME="270"></A>kneaded, that is to say, two quarts of barley meal, one pint of wine, and 
<A NAME="271"></A>a piece of meat for each man, and half the same quantity for a 
<A NAME="272"></A>servant.
<A NAME="273"></A><BR><BR>That this allowance should be sent in under the eyes of the Athenians, 
<A NAME="274"></A>and that no boat should sail to the island except openly.
<A NAME="275"></A><BR><BR>That the Athenians should continue to the island same as before, 
<A NAME="276"></A>without however landing upon it, and should refrain from attacking the 
<A NAME="277"></A>Peloponnesian troops either by land or by sea.
<A NAME="278"></A><BR><BR>That if either party should infringe any of these terms in the 
<A NAME="279"></A>slightest particular, the armistice should be at once 
<A NAME="280"></A>void.
<A NAME="281"></A><BR><BR>That the armistice should hold good until the return of the Lacedaemonian 
<A NAME="282"></A>envoys from Athens- the Athenians sending them thither in a galley and 
<A NAME="283"></A>bringing them back again- and upon the arrival of the envoys should be 
<A NAME="284"></A>at an end, and the ships be restored by the Athenians in the same state 
<A NAME="285"></A>as they received them.
<A NAME="286"></A><BR><BR>Such were the terms of the armistice, and the ships were delivered 
<A NAME="287"></A>over to the number of sixty, and the envoys sent off accordingly. Arrived 
<A NAME="288"></A>at Athens they spoke as follows:
<A NAME="289"></A><BR><BR>"Athenians, the Lacedaemonians sent us to try to find some way 
<A NAME="290"></A>of settling the affair of our men on the island, that shall be at once 
<A NAME="291"></A>satisfactory to our interests, and as consistent with our dignity in our 
<A NAME="292"></A>misfortune as circumstances permit. We can venture to speak at some length 
<A NAME="293"></A>without any departure from the habit of our country. Men of few words where 
<A NAME="294"></A>many are not wanted, we can be less brief when there is a matter of importance 
<A NAME="295"></A>to be illustrated and an end to be served by its illustration. Meanwhile 
<A NAME="296"></A>we beg you to take what we may say, not in a hostile spirit, nor as if 
<A NAME="297"></A>we thought you ignorant and wished to lecture you, but rather as a suggestion 
<A NAME="298"></A>on the best course to be taken, addressed to intelligent judges. You can 
<A NAME="299"></A>now, if you choose, employ your present success to advantage, so as to 
<A NAME="300"></A>keep what you have got and gain honour and reputation besides, and you 
<A NAME="301"></A>can avoid the mistake of those who meet with an extraordinary piece of 
<A NAME="302"></A>good fortune, and are led on by hope to grasp continually at something 
<A NAME="303"></A>further, through having already succeeded without expecting it. While those 
<A NAME="304"></A>who have known most vicissitudes of good and bad, have also justly least 
<A NAME="305"></A>faith in their prosperity; and to teach your city and ours this lesson 
<A NAME="306"></A>experience has not been wanting.
<A NAME="307"></A><BR><BR>"To be convinced of this you have only to look at our present misfortune. 
<A NAME="308"></A>What power in Hellas stood higher than we did? and yet we are come to you, 
<A NAME="309"></A>although we formerly thought ourselves more able to grant what we are now 
<A NAME="310"></A>here to ask. Nevertheless, we have not been brought to this by any decay 
<A NAME="311"></A>in our power, or through having our heads turned by aggrandizement; no, 
<A NAME="312"></A>our resources are what they have always been, and our error has been an 
<A NAME="313"></A>error of judgment, to which all are equally liable. Accordingly, the prosperity 
<A NAME="314"></A>which your city now enjoys, and the accession that it has lately received, 
<A NAME="315"></A>must not make you fancy that fortune will be always with you. Indeed sensible 
<A NAME="316"></A>men are prudent enough to treat their gains as precarious, just as they 
<A NAME="317"></A>would also keep a clear head in adversity, and think that war, so far from 
<A NAME="318"></A>staying within the limit to which a combatant may wish to confine it, will 
<A NAME="319"></A>run the course that its chances prescribe; and thus, not being puffed up 
<A NAME="320"></A>by confidence in military success, they are less likely to come to grief, 
<A NAME="321"></A>and most ready to make peace, if they can, while their fortune lasts. This, 
<A NAME="322"></A>Athenians, you have a good opportunity to do now with us, and thus to escape 
<A NAME="323"></A>the possible disasters which may follow upon your refusal, and the consequent 
<A NAME="324"></A>imputation of having owed to accident even your present advantages, when 
<A NAME="325"></A>you might have left behind you a reputation for power and wisdom which 
<A NAME="326"></A>nothing could endanger.
<A NAME="327"></A><BR><BR>"The Lacedaemonians accordingly invite you to make a treaty and 
<A NAME="328"></A>to end the war, and offer peace and alliance and the most friendly and 
<A NAME="329"></A>intimate relations in every way and on every occasion between us; and in 
<A NAME="330"></A>return ask for the men on the island, thinking it better for both parties 
<A NAME="331"></A>not to stand out to the end, on the chance of some favourable accident 
<A NAME="332"></A>enabling the men to force their way out, or of their being compelled to 
<A NAME="333"></A>succumb under the pressure of blockade. Indeed if great enmities are ever 
<A NAME="334"></A>to be really settled, we think it will be, not by the system of revenge 
<A NAME="335"></A>and military success, and by forcing an opponent to swear to a treaty to 
<A NAME="336"></A>his disadvantage, but when the more fortunate combatant waives these his 
<A NAME="337"></A>privileges, to be guided by gentler feelings conquers his rival in generosity, 
<A NAME="338"></A>and accords peace on more moderate conditions than he expected. From that 
<A NAME="339"></A>moment, instead of the debt of revenge which violence must entail, his 
<A NAME="340"></A>adversary owes a debt of generosity to be paid in kind, and is inclined 
<A NAME="341"></A>by honour to stand to his agreement. And men oftener act in this manner 
<A NAME="342"></A>towards their greatest enemies than where the quarrel is of less importance; 
<A NAME="343"></A>they are also by nature as glad to give way to those who first yield to 
<A NAME="344"></A>them, as they are apt to be provoked by arrogance to risks condemned by 
<A NAME="345"></A>their own judgment.
<A NAME="346"></A><BR><BR>"To apply this to ourselves: if peace was ever desirable for both 
<A NAME="347"></A>parties, it is surely so at the present moment, before anything irremediable 
<A NAME="348"></A>befall us and force us to hate you eternally, personally as well as politically, 
<A NAME="349"></A>and you to miss the advantages that we now offer you. While the issue is 
<A NAME="350"></A>still in doubt, and you have reputation and our friendship in prospect, 
<A NAME="351"></A>and we the compromise of our misfortune before anything fatal occur, let 
<A NAME="352"></A>us be reconciled, and for ourselves choose peace instead of war, and grant 
<A NAME="353"></A>to the rest of the Hellenes a remission from their sufferings, for which 
<A NAME="354"></A>be sure they will think they have chiefly you to thank. The war that they 
<A NAME="355"></A>labour under they know not which began, but the peace that concludes it, 
<A NAME="356"></A>as it depends on your decision, will by their gratitude be laid to your 
<A NAME="357"></A>door. By such a decision you can become firm friends with the Lacedaemonians 
<A NAME="358"></A>at their own invitation, which you do not force from them, but oblige them 
<A NAME="359"></A>by accepting. And from this friendship consider the advantages that are 
<A NAME="360"></A>likely to follow: when Attica and Sparta are at one, the rest of Hellas, 
<A NAME="361"></A>be sure, will remain in respectful inferiority before its 
<A NAME="362"></A>heads."
<A NAME="363"></A><BR><BR>Such were the words of the Lacedaemonians, their idea being that 
<A NAME="364"></A>the Athenians, already desirous of a truce and only kept back by their 
<A NAME="365"></A>opposition, would joyfully accept a peace freely offered, and give back 
<A NAME="366"></A>the men. The Athenians, however, having the men on the island, thought 
<A NAME="367"></A>that the treaty would be ready for them whenever they chose to make it, 
<A NAME="368"></A>and grasped at something further. Foremost to encourage them in this policy 
<A NAME="369"></A>was Cleon, son of Cleaenetus, a popular leader of the time and very powerful 
<A NAME="370"></A>with the multitude, who persuaded them to answer as follows: First, the 
<A NAME="371"></A>men in the island must surrender themselves and their arms and be brought 
<A NAME="372"></A>to Athens. Next, the Lacedaemonians must restore Nisaea, Pegae, Troezen, 
<A NAME="373"></A>and Achaia, all places acquired not by arms, but by the previous convention, 
<A NAME="374"></A>under which they had been ceded by Athens herself at a moment of disaster, 
<A NAME="375"></A>when a truce was more necessary to her than at present. This done they 
<A NAME="376"></A>might take back their men, and make a truce for as long as both parties 
<A NAME="377"></A>might agree.
<A NAME="378"></A><BR><BR>To this answer the envoys made no reply, but asked that commissioners 
<A NAME="379"></A>might be chosen with whom they might confer on each point, and quietly 
<A NAME="380"></A>talk the matter over and try to come to some agreement. Hereupon Cleon 
<A NAME="381"></A>violently assailed them, saying that he knew from the first that they had 
<A NAME="382"></A>no right intentions, and that it was clear enough now by their refusing 
<A NAME="383"></A>to speak before the people, and wanting to confer in secret with a committee 
<A NAME="384"></A>of two or three. No, if they meant anything honest let them say it out 
<A NAME="385"></A>before all. The Lacedaemonians, however, seeing that whatever concessions 
<A NAME="386"></A>they might be prepared to make in their misfortune, it was impossible for 
<A NAME="387"></A>them to speak before the multitude and lose credit with their allies for 
<A NAME="388"></A>a negotiation which might after all miscarry, and on the other hand, that 
<A NAME="389"></A>the Athenians would never grant what they asked upon moderate terms, returned 
<A NAME="390"></A>from Athens without having effected anything.
<A NAME="391"></A><BR><BR>Their arrival at once put an end to the armistice at Pylos, and 
<A NAME="392"></A>the Lacedaemonians asked back their ships according to the convention. 
<A NAME="393"></A>The Athenians, however, alleged an attack on the fort in contravention 
<A NAME="394"></A>of the truce, and other grievances seemingly not worth mentioning, and 
<A NAME="395"></A>refused to give them back, insisting upon the clause by which the slightest 
<A NAME="396"></A>infringement made the armistice void. The Lacedaemonians, after denying 
<A NAME="397"></A>the contravention and protesting against their bad faith in the matter 
<A NAME="398"></A>of the ships, went away and earnestly addressed themselves to the war. 
<A NAME="399"></A>Hostilities were now carried on at Pylos upon both sides with vigour. The 
<A NAME="400"></A>Athenians cruised round the island all day with two ships going different 
<A NAME="401"></A>ways; and by night, except on the seaward side in windy weather, anchored 
<A NAME="402"></A>round it with their whole fleet, which, having been reinforced by twenty 
<A NAME="403"></A>ships from Athens come to aid in the blockade, now numbered seventy sail; 
<A NAME="404"></A>while the Peloponnesians remained encamped on the continent, making attacks 
<A NAME="405"></A>on the fort, and on the look-out for any opportunity which might offer 
<A NAME="406"></A>itself for the deliverance of their men.
<A NAME="407"></A><BR><BR>Meanwhile the Syracusans and their allies in Sicily had brought 
<A NAME="408"></A>up to the squadron guarding Messina the reinforcement which we left them 
<A NAME="409"></A>preparing, and carried on the war from thence, incited chiefly by the Locrians 
<A NAME="410"></A>from hatred of the Rhegians, whose territory they had invaded with all 
<A NAME="411"></A>their forces. The Syracusans also wished to try their fortune at sea, seeing 
<A NAME="412"></A>that the Athenians had only a few ships actually at Rhegium, and hearing 
<A NAME="413"></A>that the main fleet destined to join them was engaged in blockading the 
<A NAME="414"></A>island. A naval victory, they thought, would enable them to blockade Rhegium 
<A NAME="415"></A>by sea and land, and easily to reduce it; a success which would at once 
<A NAME="416"></A>place their affairs upon a solid basis, the promontory of Rhegium in Italy 
<A NAME="417"></A>and Messina in Sicily being so near each other that it would be impossible 
<A NAME="418"></A>for the Athenians to cruise against them and command the strait. The strait 
<A NAME="419"></A>in question consists of the sea between Rhegium and Messina, at the point 
<A NAME="420"></A>where Sicily approaches nearest to the continent, and is the Charybdis 
<A NAME="421"></A>through which the story makes Ulysses sail; and the narrowness of the passage 
<A NAME="422"></A>and the strength of the current that pours in from the vast Tyrrhenian 
<A NAME="423"></A>and Sicilian mains, have rightly given it a bad reputation.
<A NAME="424"></A><BR><BR>In this strait the Syracusans and their allies were compelled to 
<A NAME="425"></A>fight, late in the day, about the passage of a boat, putting out with rather 
<A NAME="426"></A>more than thirty ships against sixteen Athenian and eight Rhegian vessels. 
<A NAME="427"></A>Defeated by the Athenians they hastily set off, each for himself, to their 
<A NAME="428"></A>own stations at Messina and Rhegium, with the loss of one ship; night coming 
<A NAME="429"></A>on before the battle was finished. After this the Locrians retired from 
<A NAME="430"></A>the Rhegian territory, and the ships of the Syracusans and their allies 
<A NAME="431"></A>united and came to anchor at Cape Pelorus, in the territory of Messina, 
<A NAME="432"></A>where their land forces joined them. Here the Athenians and Rhegians sailed 
<A NAME="433"></A>up, and seeing the ships unmanned, made an attack, in which they in their 
<A NAME="434"></A>turn lost one vessel, which was caught by a grappling iron, the crew saving 
<A NAME="435"></A>themselves by swimming. After this the Syracusans got on board their ships, 
<A NAME="436"></A>and while they were being towed alongshore to Messina, were again attacked 
<A NAME="437"></A>by the Athenians, but suddenly got out to sea and became the assailants, 
<A NAME="438"></A>and caused them to lose another vessel. After thus holding their own in 
<A NAME="439"></A>the voyage alongshore and in the engagement as above described, the Syracusans 
<A NAME="440"></A>sailed on into the harbour of Messina.
<A NAME="441"></A><BR><BR>Meanwhile the Athenians, having received warning that Camarina 
<A NAME="442"></A>was about to be betrayed to the Syracusans by Archias and his party, sailed 
<A NAME="443"></A>thither; and the Messinese took this opportunity to attack by sea and land 
<A NAME="444"></A>with all their forces their Chalcidian neighbour, Naxos. The first day 
<A NAME="445"></A>they forced the Naxians to keep their walls, and laid waste their country; 
<A NAME="446"></A>the next they sailed round with their ships, and laid waste their land 
<A NAME="447"></A>on the river Akesines, while their land forces menaced the city. Meanwhile 
<A NAME="448"></A>the Sicels came down from the high country in great numbers, to aid against 
<A NAME="449"></A>the Messinese; and the Naxians, elated at the sight, and animated by a 
<A NAME="450"></A>belief that the Leontines and their other Hellenic allies were coming to 
<A NAME="451"></A>their support, suddenly sallied out from the town, and attacked and routed 
<A NAME="452"></A>the Messinese, killing more than a thousand of them; while the remainder 
<A NAME="453"></A>suffered severely in their retreat home, being attacked by the barbarians 
<A NAME="454"></A>on the road, and most of them cut off. The ships put in to Messina, and 
<A NAME="455"></A>afterwards dispersed for their different homes. The Leontines and their 
<A NAME="456"></A>allies, with the Athenians, upon this at once turned their arms against 
<A NAME="457"></A>the now weakened Messina, and attacked, the Athenians with their ships 
<A NAME="458"></A>on the side of the harbour, and the land forces on that of the town. The 
<A NAME="459"></A>Messinese, however, sallying out with Demoteles and some Locrians who had 
<A NAME="460"></A>been left to garrison the city after the disaster, suddenly attacked and 
<A NAME="461"></A>routed most of the Leontine army, killing a great number; upon seeing which 
<A NAME="462"></A>the Athenians landed from their ships, and falling on the Messinese in 
<A NAME="463"></A>disorder chased them back into the town, and setting up a trophy retired 
<A NAME="464"></A>to Rhegium. After this the Hellenes in Sicily continued to make war on 
<A NAME="465"></A>each other by land, without the Athenians.
<A NAME="466"></A><BR><BR>Meanwhile the Athenians at Pylos were still besieging the Lacedaemonians 
<A NAME="467"></A>in the island, the Peloponnesian forces on the continent remaining where 
<A NAME="468"></A>they were. The blockade was very laborious for the Athenians from want 
<A NAME="469"></A>of food and water; there was no spring except one in the citadel of Pylos 
<A NAME="470"></A>itself, and that not a large one, and most of them were obliged to grub 
<A NAME="471"></A>up the shingle on the sea beach and drink such water as they could find. 
<A NAME="472"></A>They also suffered from want of room, being encamped in a narrow space; 
<A NAME="473"></A>and as there was no anchorage for the ships, some took their meals on shore 
<A NAME="474"></A>in their turn, while the others were anchored out at sea. But their greatest 
<A NAME="475"></A>discouragement arose from the unexpectedly long time which it took to reduce 
<A NAME="476"></A>a body of men shut up in a desert island, with only brackish water to drink, 
<A NAME="477"></A>a matter which they had imagined would take them only a few days. The fact 
<A NAME="478"></A>was that the Lacedaemonians had made advertisement for volunteers to carry 
<A NAME="479"></A>into the island ground corn, wine, cheese, and any other food useful in 
<A NAME="480"></A>a siege; high prices being offered, and freedom promised to any of the 
<A NAME="481"></A>Helots who should succeed in doing so. The Helots accordingly were most 
<A NAME="482"></A>forward to engage in this risky traffic, putting off from this or that 
<A NAME="483"></A>part of Peloponnese, and running in by night on the seaward side of the 
<A NAME="484"></A>island. They were best pleased, however, when they could catch a wind to 
<A NAME="485"></A>carry them in. It was more easy to elude the look-out of the galleys, when 
<A NAME="486"></A>it blew from the seaward, as it became impossible for them to anchor round 
<A NAME="487"></A>the island; while the Helots had their boats rated at their value in money, 
<A NAME="488"></A>and ran them ashore, without caring how they landed, being sure to find 
<A NAME="489"></A>the soldiers waiting for them at the landing-places. But all who risked 
<A NAME="490"></A>it in fair weather were taken. Divers also swam in under water from the 
<A NAME="491"></A>harbour, dragging by a cord in skins poppyseed mixed with honey, and bruised 
<A NAME="492"></A>linseed; these at first escaped notice, but afterwards a look-out was kept 
<A NAME="493"></A>for them. In short, both sides tried every possible contrivance, the one 
<A NAME="494"></A>to throw in provisions, and the other to prevent their 
<A NAME="495"></A>introduction.
<A NAME="496"></A><BR><BR>At Athens, meanwhile, the news that the army was in great distress, 
<A NAME="497"></A>and that corn found its way in to the men in the island, caused no small 
<A NAME="498"></A>perplexity; and the Athenians began to fear that winter might come on and 
<A NAME="499"></A>find them still engaged in the blockade. They saw that the convoying of 
<A NAME="500"></A>provisions round Peloponnese would be then impossible. The country offered 
<A NAME="501"></A>no resources in itself, and even in summer they could not send round enough. 
<A NAME="502"></A>The blockade of a place without harbours could no longer be kept up; and 
<A NAME="503"></A>the men would either escape by the siege being abandoned, or would watch 
<A NAME="504"></A>for bad weather and sail out in the boats that brought in their corn. What 
<A NAME="505"></A>caused still more alarm was the attitude of the Lacedaemonians, who must, 
<A NAME="506"></A>it was thought by the Athenians, feel themselves on strong ground not to 
<A NAME="507"></A>send them any more envoys; and they began to repent having rejected the 
<A NAME="508"></A>treaty. Cleon, perceiving the disfavour with which he was regarded for 
<A NAME="509"></A>having stood in the way of the convention, now said that their informants 
<A NAME="510"></A>did not speak the truth; and upon the messengers recommending them, if 
<A NAME="511"></A>they did not believe them, to send some commissioners to see, Cleon himself 
<A NAME="512"></A>and Theagenes were chosen by the Athenians as commissioners. Aware that 
<A NAME="513"></A>he would now be obliged either to say what had been already said by the 
<A NAME="514"></A>men whom he was slandering, or be proved a liar if he said the contrary, 
<A NAME="515"></A>he told the Athenians, whom he saw to be not altogether disinclined for 
<A NAME="516"></A>a fresh expedition, that instead of sending and wasting their time and 
<A NAME="517"></A>opportunities, if they believed what was told them, they ought to sail 
<A NAME="518"></A>against the men. And pointing at Nicias, son of Niceratus, then general, 
<A NAME="519"></A>whom he hated, he tauntingly said that it would be easy, if they had men 
<A NAME="520"></A>for generals, to sail with a force and take those in the island, and that 
<A NAME="521"></A>if he had himself been in command, he would have done 
<A NAME="522"></A>it.
<A NAME="523"></A><BR><BR>Nicias, seeing the Athenians murmuring against Cleon for not sailing 
<A NAME="524"></A>now if it seemed to him so easy, and further seeing himself the object 
<A NAME="525"></A>of attack, told him that for all that the generals cared, he might take 
<A NAME="526"></A>what force he chose and make the attempt. At first Cleon fancied that this 
<A NAME="527"></A>resignation was merely a figure of speech, and was ready to go, but finding 
<A NAME="528"></A>that it was seriously meant, he drew back, and said that Nicias, not he, 
<A NAME="529"></A>was general, being now frightened, and having never supposed that Nicias 
<A NAME="530"></A>would go so far as to retire in his favour. Nicias, however, repeated his 
<A NAME="531"></A>offer, and resigned the command against Pylos, and called the Athenians 
<A NAME="532"></A>to witness that he did so. And as the multitude is wont to do, the more 
<A NAME="533"></A>Cleon shrank from the expedition and tried to back out of what he had said, 
<A NAME="534"></A>the more they encouraged Nicias to hand over his command, and clamoured 
<A NAME="535"></A>at Cleon to go. At last, not knowing how to get out of his words, he undertook 
<A NAME="536"></A>the expedition, and came forward and said that he was not afraid of the 
<A NAME="537"></A>Lacedaemonians, but would sail without taking any one from the city with 
<A NAME="538"></A>him, except the Lemnians and Imbrians that were at Athens, with some targeteers 
<A NAME="539"></A>that had come up from Aenus, and four hundred archers from other quarters. 
<A NAME="540"></A>With these and the soldiers at Pylos, he would within twenty days either 
<A NAME="541"></A>bring the Lacedaemonians alive, or kill them on the spot. The Athenians 
<A NAME="542"></A>could not help laughing at his fatuity, while sensible men comforted themselves 
<A NAME="543"></A>with the reflection that they must gain in either circumstance; either 
<A NAME="544"></A>they would be rid of Cleon, which they rather hoped, or if disappointed 
<A NAME="545"></A>in this expectation, would reduce the Lacedaemonians.
<A NAME="546"></A><BR><BR>After he had settled everything in the assembly, and the Athenians 
<A NAME="547"></A>had voted him the command of the expedition, he chose as his colleague 
<A NAME="548"></A>Demosthenes, one of the generals at Pylos, and pushed forward the preparations 
<A NAME="549"></A>for his voyage. His choice fell upon Demosthenes because he heard that 
<A NAME="550"></A>he was contemplating a descent on the island; the soldiers distressed by 
<A NAME="551"></A>the difficulties of the position, and rather besieged than besiegers, being 
<A NAME="552"></A>eager to fight it out, while the firing of the island had increased the 
<A NAME="553"></A>confidence of the general. He had been at first afraid, because the island 
<A NAME="554"></A>having never been inhabited was almost entirely covered with wood and without 
<A NAME="555"></A>paths, thinking this to be in the enemy's favour, as he might land with 
<A NAME="556"></A>a large force, and yet might suffer loss by an attack from an unseen position. 
<A NAME="557"></A>The mistakes and forces of the enemy the wood would in a great measure 
<A NAME="558"></A>conceal from him, while every blunder of his own troops would be at once 
<A NAME="559"></A>detected, and they would be thus able to fall upon him unexpectedly just 
<A NAME="560"></A>where they pleased, the attack being always in their power. If, on the 
<A NAME="561"></A>other hand, he should force them to engage in the thicket, the smaller 
<A NAME="562"></A>number who knew the country would, he thought, have the advantage over 
<A NAME="563"></A>the larger who were ignorant of it, while his own army might be cut off 
<A NAME="564"></A>imperceptibly, in spite of its numbers, as the men would not be able to 
<A NAME="565"></A>see where to succour each other.
<A NAME="566"></A><BR><BR>The Aetolian disaster, which had been mainly caused by the wood, 
<A NAME="567"></A>had not a little to do with these reflections. Meanwhile, one of the soldiers 
<A NAME="568"></A>who were compelled by want of room to land on the extremities of the island 
<A NAME="569"></A>and take their dinners, with outposts fixed to prevent a surprise, set 
<A NAME="570"></A>fire to a little of the wood without meaning to do so; and as it came on 
<A NAME="571"></A>to blow soon afterwards, almost the whole was consumed before they were 
<A NAME="572"></A>aware of it. Demosthenes was now able for the first time to see how numerous 
<A NAME="573"></A>the Lacedaemonians really were, having up to this moment been under the 
<A NAME="574"></A>impression that they took in provisions for a smaller number; he also saw 
<A NAME="575"></A>that the Athenians thought success important and were anxious about it, 
<A NAME="576"></A>and that it was now easier to land on the island, and accordingly got ready 
<A NAME="577"></A>for the attempt, sent for troops from the allies in the neighbourhood, 
<A NAME="578"></A>and pushed forward his other preparations. At this moment Cleon arrived 
<A NAME="579"></A>at Pylos with the troops which he had asked for, having sent on word to 
<A NAME="580"></A>say that he was coming. The first step taken by the two generals after 
<A NAME="581"></A>their meeting was to send a herald to the camp on the mainland, to ask 
<A NAME="582"></A>if they were disposed to avoid all risk and to order the men on the island 
<A NAME="583"></A>to surrender themselves and their arms, to be kept in gentle custody until 
<A NAME="584"></A>some general convention should be concluded.
<A NAME="585"></A><BR><BR>On the rejection of this proposition the generals let one day pass, 
<A NAME="586"></A>and the next, embarking all their heavy infantry on board a few ships, 
<A NAME="587"></A>put out by night, and a little before dawn landed on both sides of the 
<A NAME="588"></A>island from the open sea and from the harbour, being about eight hundred 
<A NAME="589"></A>strong, and advanced with a run against the first post in the 
<A NAME="590"></A>island.
<A NAME="591"></A><BR><BR>The enemy had distributed his force as follows: In this first post 
<A NAME="592"></A>there were about thirty heavy infantry; the centre and most level part, 
<A NAME="593"></A>where the water was, was held by the main body, and by Epitadas their commander; 
<A NAME="594"></A>while a small party guarded the very end of the island, towards Pylos, 
<A NAME="595"></A>which was precipitous on the sea-side and very difficult to attack from 
<A NAME="596"></A>the land, and where there was also a sort of old fort of stones rudely 
<A NAME="597"></A>put together, which they thought might be useful to them, in case they 
<A NAME="598"></A>should be forced to retreat. Such was their disposition.
<A NAME="599"></A><BR><BR>The advanced post thus attacked by the Athenians was at once put 
<A NAME="600"></A>to the sword, the men being scarcely out of bed and still arming, the landing 
<A NAME="601"></A>having taken them by surprise, as they fancied the ships were only sailing 
<A NAME="602"></A>as usual to their stations for the night. As soon as day broke, the rest 
<A NAME="603"></A>of the army landed, that is to say, all the crews of rather more than seventy 
<A NAME="604"></A>ships, except the lowest rank of oars, with the arms they carried, eight 
<A NAME="605"></A>hundred archers, and as many targeteers, the Messenian reinforcements, 
<A NAME="606"></A>and all the other troops on duty round Pylos, except the garrison on the 
<A NAME="607"></A>fort. The tactics of Demosthenes had divided them into companies of two 
<A NAME="608"></A>hundred, more or less, and made them occupy the highest points in order 
<A NAME="609"></A>to paralyse the enemy by surrounding him on every side and thus leaving 
<A NAME="610"></A>him without any tangible adversary, exposed to the cross-fire of their 
<A NAME="611"></A>host; plied by those in his rear if he attacked in front, and by those 
<A NAME="612"></A>on one flank if he moved against those on the other. In short, wherever 
<A NAME="613"></A>he went he would have the assailants behind him, and these light-armed 
<A NAME="614"></A>assailants, the most awkward of all; arrows, darts, stones, and slings 
<A NAME="615"></A>making them formidable at a distance, and there being no means of getting 
<A NAME="616"></A>at them at close quarters, as they could conquer flying, and the moment 
<A NAME="617"></A>their pursuer turned they were upon him. Such was the idea that inspired 
<A NAME="618"></A>Demosthenes in his conception of the descent, and presided over its 
<A NAME="619"></A>execution.
<A NAME="620"></A><BR><BR>Meanwhile the main body of the troops in the island (that under 
<A NAME="621"></A>Epitadas), seeing their outpost cut off and an army advancing against them, 
<A NAME="622"></A>serried their ranks and pressed forward to close with the Athenian heavy 
<A NAME="623"></A>infantry in front of them, the light troops being upon their flanks and 
<A NAME="624"></A>rear. However, they were not able to engage or to profit by their superior 
<A NAME="625"></A>skill, the light troops keeping them in check on either side with their 
<A NAME="626"></A>missiles, and the heavy infantry remaining stationary instead of advancing 
<A NAME="627"></A>to meet them; and although they routed the light troops wherever they ran 
<A NAME="628"></A>up and approached too closely, yet they retreated fighting, being lightly 
<A NAME="629"></A>equipped, and easily getting the start in their flight, from the difficult 
<A NAME="630"></A>and rugged nature of the ground, in an island hitherto desert, over which 
<A NAME="631"></A>the Lacedaemonians could not pursue them with their heavy 
<A NAME="632"></A>armour.
<A NAME="633"></A><BR><BR>After this skirmishing had lasted some little while, the Lacedaemonians 
<A NAME="634"></A>became unable to dash out with the same rapidity as before upon the points 
<A NAME="635"></A>attacked, and the light troops finding that they now fought with less vigour, 
<A NAME="636"></A>became more confident. They could see with their own eyes that they were 
<A NAME="637"></A>many times more numerous than the enemy; they were now more familiar with 
<A NAME="638"></A>his aspect and found him less terrible, the result not having justified 
<A NAME="639"></A>the apprehensions which they had suffered, when they first landed in slavish 
<A NAME="640"></A>dismay at the idea of attacking Lacedaemonians; and accordingly their fear 
<A NAME="641"></A>changing to disdain, they now rushed all together with loud shouts upon 
<A NAME="642"></A>them, and pelted them with stones, darts, and arrows, whichever came first 
<A NAME="643"></A>to hand. The shouting accompanying their onset confounded the Lacedaemonians, 
<A NAME="644"></A>unaccustomed to this mode of fighting; dust rose from the newly burnt wood, 
<A NAME="645"></A>and it was impossible to see in front of one with the arrows and stones 
<A NAME="646"></A>flying through clouds of dust from the hands of numerous assailants. The 
<A NAME="647"></A>Lacedaemonians had now to sustain a rude conflict; their caps would not 
<A NAME="648"></A>keep out the arrows, darts had broken off in the armour of the wounded, 
<A NAME="649"></A>while they themselves were helpless for offence, being prevented from using 
<A NAME="650"></A>their eyes to see what was before them, and unable to hear the words of 
<A NAME="651"></A>command for the hubbub raised by the enemy; danger encompassed them on 
<A NAME="652"></A>every side, and there was no hope of any means of defence or 
<A NAME="653"></A>safety.
<A NAME="654"></A><BR><BR>At last, after many had been already wounded in the confined space 
<A NAME="655"></A>in which they were fighting, they formed in close order and retired on 
<A NAME="656"></A>the fort at the end of the island, which was not far off, and to their 
<A NAME="657"></A>friends who held it. The moment they gave way, the light troops became 
<A NAME="658"></A>bolder and pressed upon them, shouting louder than ever, and killed as 
<A NAME="659"></A>many as they came up with in their retreat, but most of the Lacedaemonians 
<A NAME="660"></A>made good their escape to the fort, and with the garrison in it ranged 
<A NAME="661"></A>themselves all along its whole extent to repulse the enemy wherever it 
<A NAME="662"></A>was assailable. The Athenians pursuing, unable to surround and hem them 
<A NAME="663"></A>in, owing to the strength of the ground, attacked them in front and tried 
<A NAME="664"></A>to storm the position. For a long time, indeed for most of the day, both 
<A NAME="665"></A>sides held out against all the torments of the battle, thirst, and sun, 
<A NAME="666"></A>the one endeavouring to drive the enemy from the high ground, the other 
<A NAME="667"></A>to maintain himself upon it, it being now more easy for the Lacedaemonians 
<A NAME="668"></A>to defend themselves than before, as they could not be surrounded on the 
<A NAME="669"></A>flanks.
<A NAME="670"></A><BR><BR>The struggle began to seem endless, when the commander of the Messenians 
<A NAME="671"></A>came to Cleon and Demosthenes, and told them that they were losing their 
<A NAME="672"></A>labour: but if they would give him some archers and light troops to go 
<A NAME="673"></A>round on the enemy's rear by a way he would undertake to find, he thought 
<A NAME="674"></A>he could force the approach. Upon receiving what he asked for, he started 
<A NAME="675"></A>from a point out of sight in order not to be seen by the enemy, and creeping 
<A NAME="676"></A>on wherever the precipices of the island permitted, and where the Lacedaemonians, 
<A NAME="677"></A>trusting to the strength of the ground, kept no guard, succeeded after 
<A NAME="678"></A>the greatest difficulty in getting round without their seeing him, and 
<A NAME="679"></A>suddenly appeared on the high ground in their rear, to the dismay of the 
<A NAME="680"></A>surprised enemy and the still greater joy of his expectant friends. The 
<A NAME="681"></A>Lacedaemonians thus placed between two fires, and in the same dilemma, 
<A NAME="682"></A>to compare small things with great, as at Thermopylae, where the defenders 
<A NAME="683"></A>were cut off through the Persians getting round by the path, being now 
<A NAME="684"></A>attacked in front and behind, began to give way, and overcome by the odds 
<A NAME="685"></A>against them and exhausted from want of food, retreated.
<A NAME="686"></A><BR><BR>The Athenians were already masters of the approaches when Cleon 
<A NAME="687"></A>and Demosthenes perceiving that, if the enemy gave way a single step further, 
<A NAME="688"></A>they would be destroyed by their soldiery, put a stop to the battle and 
<A NAME="689"></A>held their men back; wishing to take the Lacedaemonians alive to Athens, 
<A NAME="690"></A>and hoping that their stubbornness might relax on hearing the offer of 
<A NAME="691"></A>terms, and that they might surrender and yield to the present overwhelming 
<A NAME="692"></A>danger. Proclamation was accordingly made, to know if they would surrender 
<A NAME="693"></A>themselves and their arms to the Athenians to be dealt at their 
<A NAME="694"></A>discretion.
<A NAME="695"></A><BR><BR>The Lacedaemonians hearing this offer, most of them lowered their 
<A NAME="696"></A>shields and waved their hands to show that they accepted it. Hostilities 
<A NAME="697"></A>now ceased, and a parley was held between Cleon and Demosthenes and Styphon, 
<A NAME="698"></A>son of Pharax, on the other side; since Epitadas, the first of the previous 
<A NAME="699"></A>commanders, had been killed, and Hippagretas, the next in command, left 
<A NAME="700"></A>for dead among the slain, though still alive, and thus the command had 
<A NAME="701"></A>devolved upon Styphon according to the law, in case of anything happening 
<A NAME="702"></A>to his superiors. Styphon and his companions said they wished to send a 
<A NAME="703"></A>herald to the Lacedaemonians on the mainland, to know what they were to 
<A NAME="704"></A>do. The Athenians would not let any of them go, but themselves called for 
<A NAME="705"></A>heralds from the mainland, and after questions had been carried backwards 
<A NAME="706"></A>and forwards two or three times, the last man that passed over from the 
<A NAME="707"></A>Lacedaemonians on the continent brought this message: "The Lacedaemonians 
<A NAME="708"></A>bid you to decide for yourselves so long as you do nothing dishonourable"; 
<A NAME="709"></A>upon which after consulting together they surrendered themselves and their 
<A NAME="710"></A>arms. The Athenians, after guarding them that day and night, the next morning 
<A NAME="711"></A>set up a trophy in the island, and got ready to sail, giving their prisoners 
<A NAME="712"></A>in batches to be guarded by the captains of the galleys; and the Lacedaemonians 
<A NAME="713"></A>sent a herald and took up their dead. The number of the killed and prisoners 
<A NAME="714"></A>taken in the island was as follows: four hundred and twenty heavy infantry 
<A NAME="715"></A>had passed over; three hundred all but eight were taken alive to Athens; 
<A NAME="716"></A>the rest were killed. About a hundred and twenty of the prisoners were 
<A NAME="717"></A>Spartans. The Athenian loss was small, the battle not having been fought 
<A NAME="718"></A>at close quarters.
<A NAME="719"></A><BR><BR>The blockade in all, counting from the fight at sea to the battle 
<A NAME="720"></A>in the island, had lasted seventy-two days. For twenty of these, during 
<A NAME="721"></A>the absence of the envoys sent to treat for peace, the men had provisions 
<A NAME="722"></A>given them, for the rest they were fed by the smugglers. Corn and other 
<A NAME="723"></A>victual was found in the island; the commander Epitadas having kept the 
<A NAME="724"></A>men upon half rations. The Athenians and Peloponnesians now each withdrew 
<A NAME="725"></A>their forces from Pylos, and went home, and crazy as Cleon's promise was, 
<A NAME="726"></A>he fulfilled it, by bringing the men to Athens within the twenty days as 
<A NAME="727"></A>he had pledged himself to do.
<A NAME="728"></A><BR><BR>Nothing that happened in the war surprised the Hellenes so much 
<A NAME="729"></A>as this. It was the opinion that no force or famine could make the Lacedaemonians 
<A NAME="730"></A>give up their arms, but that they would fight on as they could, and die 
<A NAME="731"></A>with them in their hands: indeed people could scarcely believe that those 
<A NAME="732"></A>who had surrendered were of the same stuff as the fallen; and an Athenian 
<A NAME="733"></A>ally, who some time after insultingly asked one of the prisoners from the 
<A NAME="734"></A>island if those that had fallen were men of honour, received for answer 
<A NAME="735"></A>that the atraktos- that is, the arrow- would be worth a great deal if it 
<A NAME="736"></A>could tell men of honour from the rest; in allusion to the fact that the 
<A NAME="737"></A>killed were those whom the stones and the arrows happened to 
<A NAME="738"></A>hit.
<A NAME="739"></A><BR><BR>Upon the arrival of the men the Athenians determined to keep them 
<A NAME="740"></A>in prison until the peace, and if the Peloponnesians invaded their country 
<A NAME="741"></A>in the interval, to bring them out and put them to death. Meanwhile the 
<A NAME="742"></A>defence of Pylos was not forgotten; the Messenians from Naupactus sent 
<A NAME="743"></A>to their old country, to which Pylos formerly belonged, some of the likeliest 
<A NAME="744"></A>of their number, and began a series of incursions into Laconia, which their 
<A NAME="745"></A>common dialect rendered most destructive. The Lacedaemonians, hitherto 
<A NAME="746"></A>without experience of incursions or a warfare of the kind, finding the 
<A NAME="747"></A>Helots deserting, and fearing the march of revolution in their country, 
<A NAME="748"></A>began to be seriously uneasy, and in spite of their unwillingness to betray 
<A NAME="749"></A>this to the Athenians began to send envoys to Athens, and tried to recover 
<A NAME="750"></A>Pylos and the prisoners. The Athenians, however, kept grasping at more, 
<A NAME="751"></A>and dismissed envoy after envoy without their having effected anything. 
<A NAME="752"></A>Such was the history of the affair of Pylos.

<A NAME="753"></A><B>Chapter XIII</B>

<A NAME="754"></A><BR><BR><B>Seventh and Eighth Years of the War - End of</B> <B>Corcyraean 
<A NAME="755"></A>Revolution - Peace of Gela -</B> <B>Capture of Nisaea</B>
<A NAME="756"></A><BR><BR>The same summer, directly after these events, the Athenians made 
<A NAME="757"></A>an expedition against the territory of Corinth with eighty ships and two 
<A NAME="758"></A>thousand Athenian heavy infantry, and two hundred cavalry on board horse 
<A NAME="759"></A>transports, accompanied by the Milesians, Andrians, and Carystians from 
<A NAME="760"></A>the allies, under the command of Nicias, son of Niceratus, with two colleagues. 
<A NAME="761"></A>Putting out to sea they made land at daybreak between Chersonese and Rheitus, 
<A NAME="762"></A>at the beach of the country underneath the Solygian hill, upon which the 
<A NAME="763"></A>Dorians in old times established themselves and carried on war against 
<A NAME="764"></A>the Aeolian inhabitants of Corinth, and where a village now stands called 
<A NAME="765"></A>Solygia. The beach where the fleet came to is about a mile and a half from 
<A NAME="766"></A>the village, seven miles from Corinth, and two and a quarter from the Isthmus. 
<A NAME="767"></A>The Corinthians had heard from Argos of the coming of the Athenian armament, 
<A NAME="768"></A>and had all come up to the Isthmus long before, with the exception of those 
<A NAME="769"></A>who lived beyond it, and also of five hundred who were away in garrison 
<A NAME="770"></A>in Ambracia and Leucadia; and they were there in full force watching for 
<A NAME="771"></A>the Athenians to land. These last, however, gave them the slip by coming 
<A NAME="772"></A>in the dark; and being informed by signals of the fact the Corinthians 
<A NAME="773"></A>left half their number at Cenchreae, in case the Athenians should go against 
<A NAME="774"></A>Crommyon, and marched in all haste to the rescue.
<A NAME="775"></A><BR><BR>Battus, one of the two generals present at the action, went with 
<A NAME="776"></A>a company to defend the village of Solygia, which was unfortified; Lycophron 
<A NAME="777"></A>remaining to give battle with the rest. The Corinthians first attacked 
<A NAME="778"></A>the right wing of the Athenians, which had just landed in front of Chersonese, 
<A NAME="779"></A>and afterwards the rest of the army. The battle was an obstinate one, and 
<A NAME="780"></A>fought throughout hand to hand. The right wing of the Athenians and Carystians, 
<A NAME="781"></A>who had been placed at the end of the line, received and with some difficulty 
<A NAME="782"></A>repulsed the Corinthians, who thereupon retreated to a wall upon the rising 
<A NAME="783"></A>ground behind, and throwing down the stones upon them, came on again singing 
<A NAME="784"></A>the paean, and being received by the Athenians, were again engaged at close 
<A NAME="785"></A>quarters. At this moment a Corinthian company having come to the relief 
<A NAME="786"></A>of the left wing, routed and pursued the Athenian right to the sea, whence 
<A NAME="787"></A>they were in their turn driven back by the Athenians and Carystians from 
<A NAME="788"></A>the ships. Meanwhile the rest of the army on either side fought on tenaciously, 
<A NAME="789"></A>especially the right wing of the Corinthians, where Lycophron sustained 
<A NAME="790"></A>the attack of the Athenian left, which it was feared might attempt the 
<A NAME="791"></A>village of Solygia.
<A NAME="792"></A><BR><BR>After holding on for a long while without either giving way, the 
<A NAME="793"></A>Athenians aided by their horse, of which the enemy had none, at length 
<A NAME="794"></A>routed the Corinthians, who retired to the hill and, halting, remained 
<A NAME="795"></A>quiet there, without coming down again. It was in this rout of the right 
<A NAME="796"></A>wing that they had the most killed, Lycophron their general being among 
<A NAME="797"></A>the number. The rest of the army, broken and put to flight in this way 
<A NAME="798"></A>without being seriously pursued or hurried, retired to the high ground 
<A NAME="799"></A>and there took up its position. The Athenians, finding that the enemy no 
<A NAME="800"></A>longer offered to engage them, stripped his dead and took up their own 
<A NAME="801"></A>and immediately set up a trophy. Meanwhile, the half of the Corinthians 
<A NAME="802"></A>left at Cenchreae to guard against the Athenians sailing on Crommyon, although 
<A NAME="803"></A>unable to see the battle for Mount Oneion, found out what was going on 
<A NAME="804"></A>by the dust, and hurried up to the rescue; as did also the older Corinthians 
<A NAME="805"></A>from the town, upon discovering what had occurred. The Athenians seeing 
<A NAME="806"></A>them all coming against them, and thinking that they were reinforcements 
<A NAME="807"></A>arriving from the neighbouring Peloponnesians, withdrew in haste to their 
<A NAME="808"></A>ships with their spoils and their own dead, except two that they left behind, 
<A NAME="809"></A>not being able to find them, and going on board crossed over to the islands 
<A NAME="810"></A>opposite, and from thence sent a herald, and took up under truce the bodies 
<A NAME="811"></A>which they had left behind. Two hundred and twelve Corinthians fell in 
<A NAME="812"></A>the battle, and rather less than fifty Athenians.
<A NAME="813"></A><BR><BR>Weighing from the islands, the Athenians sailed the same day to 
<A NAME="814"></A>Crommyon in the Corinthian territory, about thirteen miles from the city, 
<A NAME="815"></A>and coming to anchor laid waste the country, and passed the night there. 
<A NAME="816"></A>The next day, after first coasting along to the territory of Epidaurus 
<A NAME="817"></A>and making a descent there, they came to Methana between Epidaurus and 
<A NAME="818"></A>Troezen, and drew a wall across and fortified the isthmus of the peninsula, 
<A NAME="819"></A>and left a post there from which incursions were henceforth made upon the 
<A NAME="820"></A>country of Troezen, Haliae, and Epidaurus. After walling off this spot, 
<A NAME="821"></A>the fleet sailed off home.
<A NAME="822"></A><BR><BR>While these events were going on, Eurymedon and Sophocles had put 
<A NAME="823"></A>to sea with the Athenian fleet from Pylos on their way to Sicily and, arriving 
<A NAME="824"></A>at Corcyra, joined the townsmen in an expedition against the party established 
<A NAME="825"></A>on Mount Istone, who had crossed over, as I have mentioned, after the revolution 
<A NAME="826"></A>and become masters of the country, to the great hurt of the inhabitants. 
<A NAME="827"></A>Their stronghold having been taken by an attack, the garrison took refuge 
<A NAME="828"></A>in a body upon some high ground and there capitulated, agreeing to give 
<A NAME="829"></A>up their mercenary auxiliaries, lay down their arms, and commit themselves 
<A NAME="830"></A>to the discretion of the Athenian people. The generals carried them across 
<A NAME="831"></A>under truce to the island of Ptychia, to be kept in custody until they 
<A NAME="832"></A>could be sent to Athens, upon the understanding that, if any were caught 
<A NAME="833"></A>running away, all would lose the benefit of the treaty. Meanwhile the leaders 
<A NAME="834"></A>of the Corcyraean commons, afraid that the Athenians might spare the lives 
<A NAME="835"></A>of the prisoners, had recourse to the following stratagem. They gained 
<A NAME="836"></A>over some few men on the island by secretly sending friends with instructions 
<A NAME="837"></A>to provide them with a boat, and to tell them, as if for their own sakes, 
<A NAME="838"></A>that they had best escape as quickly as possible, as the Athenian generals 
<A NAME="839"></A>were going to give them up to the Corcyraean people.
<A NAME="840"></A><BR><BR>These representations succeeding, it was so arranged that the men 
<A NAME="841"></A>were caught sailing out in the boat that was provided, and the treaty became 
<A NAME="842"></A>void accordingly, and the whole body were given up to the Corcyraeans. 
<A NAME="843"></A>For this result the Athenian generals were in a great measure responsible; 
<A NAME="844"></A>their evident disinclination to sail for Sicily, and thus to leave to others 
<A NAME="845"></A>the honour of conducting the men to Athens, encouraged the intriguers in 
<A NAME="846"></A>their design and seemed to affirm the truth of their representations. The 
<A NAME="847"></A>prisoners thus handed over were shut up by the Corcyraeans in a large building, 
<A NAME="848"></A>and afterwards taken out by twenties and led past two lines of heavy infantry, 
<A NAME="849"></A>one on each side, being bound together, and beaten and stabbed by the men 
<A NAME="850"></A>in the lines whenever any saw pass a personal enemy; while men carrying 
<A NAME="851"></A>whips went by their side and hastened on the road those that walked too 
<A NAME="852"></A>slowly.
<A NAME="853"></A><BR><BR>As many as sixty men were taken out and killed in this way without 
<A NAME="854"></A>the knowledge of their friends in the building, who fancied they were merely 
<A NAME="855"></A>being moved from one prison to another. At last, however, someone opened 
<A NAME="856"></A>their eyes to the truth, upon which they called upon the Athenians to kill 
<A NAME="857"></A>them themselves, if such was their pleasure, and refused any longer to 
<A NAME="858"></A>go out of the building, and said they would do all they could to prevent 
<A NAME="859"></A>any one coming in. The Corcyraeans, not liking themselves to force a passage 
<A NAME="860"></A>by the doors, got up on the top of the building, and breaking through the 
<A NAME="861"></A>roof, threw down the tiles and let fly arrows at them, from which the prisoners 
<A NAME="862"></A>sheltered themselves as well as they could. Most of their number, meanwhile, 
<A NAME="863"></A>were engaged in dispatching themselves by thrusting into their throats 
<A NAME="864"></A>the arrows shot by the enemy, and hanging themselves with the cords taken 
<A NAME="865"></A>from some beds that happened to be there, and with strips made from their 
<A NAME="866"></A>clothing; adopting, in short, every possible means of self-destruction, 
<A NAME="867"></A>and also falling victims to the missiles of their enemies on the roof. 
<A NAME="868"></A>Night came on while these horrors were enacting, and most of it had passed 
<A NAME="869"></A>before they were concluded. When it was day the Corcyraeans threw them 
<A NAME="870"></A>in layers upon wagons and carried them out of the city. All the women taken 
<A NAME="871"></A>in the stronghold were sold as slaves. In this way the Corcyraeans of the 
<A NAME="872"></A>mountain were destroyed by the commons; and so after terrible excesses 
<A NAME="873"></A>the party strife came to an end, at least as far as the period of this 
<A NAME="874"></A>war is concerned, for of one party there was practically nothing left. 
<A NAME="875"></A>Meanwhile the Athenians sailed off to Sicily, their primary destination, 
<A NAME="876"></A>and carried on the war with their allies there.
<A NAME="877"></A><BR><BR>At the close of the summer, the Athenians at Naupactus and the 
<A NAME="878"></A>Acarnanians made an expedition against Anactorium, the Corinthian town 
<A NAME="879"></A>lying at the mouth of the Ambracian Gulf, and took it by treachery; and 
<A NAME="880"></A>the Acarnanians themselves, sending settlers from all parts of Acarnania, 
<A NAME="881"></A>occupied the place.
<A NAME="882"></A><BR><BR>Summer was now over. During the winter ensuing, Aristides, son 
<A NAME="883"></A>of Archippus, one of the commanders of the Athenian ships sent to collect 
<A NAME="884"></A>money from the allies, arrested at Eion, on the Strymon, Artaphernes, a 
<A NAME="885"></A>Persian, on his way from the King to Lacedaemon. He was conducted to Athens, 
<A NAME="886"></A>where the Athenians got his dispatches translated from the Assyrian character 
<A NAME="887"></A>and read them. With numerous references to other subjects, they in substance 
<A NAME="888"></A>told the Lacedaemonians that the King did not know what they wanted, as 
<A NAME="889"></A>of the many ambassadors they had sent him no two ever told the same story; 
<A NAME="890"></A>if however they were prepared to speak plainly they might send him some 
<A NAME="891"></A>envoys with this Persian. The Athenians afterwards sent back Artaphernes 
<A NAME="892"></A>in a galley to Ephesus, and ambassadors with him, who heard there of the 
<A NAME="893"></A>death of King Artaxerxes, son of Xerxes, which took place about that time, 
<A NAME="894"></A>and so returned home.
<A NAME="895"></A><BR><BR>The same winter the Chians pulled down their new wall at the command 
<A NAME="896"></A>of the Athenians, who suspected them of meditating an insurrection, after 
<A NAME="897"></A>first however obtaining pledges from the Athenians, and security as far 
<A NAME="898"></A>as this was possible for their continuing to treat them as before. Thus 
<A NAME="899"></A>the winter ended, and with it ended the seventh year of this war of which 
<A NAME="900"></A>Thucydides is the historian.
<A NAME="901"></A><BR><BR>In first days of the next summer there was an eclipse of the sun 
<A NAME="902"></A>at the time of new moon, and in the early part of the same month an earthquake. 
<A NAME="903"></A>Meanwhile, the Mitylenian and other Lesbian exiles set out, for the most 
<A NAME="904"></A>part from the continent, with mercenaries hired in Peloponnese, and others 
<A NAME="905"></A>levied on the spot, and took Rhoeteum, but restored it without injury on 
<A NAME="906"></A>the receipt of two thousand Phocaean staters. After this they marched against 
<A NAME="907"></A>Antandrus and took the town by treachery, their plan being to free Antandrus 
<A NAME="908"></A>and the rest of the Actaean towns, formerly owned by Mitylene but now held 
<A NAME="909"></A>by the Athenians. Once fortified there, they would have every facility 
<A NAME="910"></A>for ship-building from the vicinity of Ida and the consequent abundance 
<A NAME="911"></A>of timber, and plenty of other supplies, and might from this base easily 
<A NAME="912"></A>ravage Lesbos, which was not far off, and make themselves masters of the 
<A NAME="913"></A>Aeolian towns on the continent.
<A NAME="914"></A><BR><BR>While these were the schemes of the exiles, the Athenians in the 
<A NAME="915"></A>same summer made an expedition with sixty ships, two thousand heavy infantry, 
<A NAME="916"></A>a few cavalry, and some allied troops from Miletus and other parts, against 
<A NAME="917"></A>Cythera, under the command of Nicias, son of Niceratus, Nicostratus, son 
<A NAME="918"></A>of Diotrephes, and Autocles, son of Tolmaeus. Cythera is an island lying 
<A NAME="919"></A>off Laconia, opposite Malea; the inhabitants are Lacedaemonians of the 
<A NAME="920"></A>class of the Perioeci; and an officer called the judge of Cythera went 
<A NAME="921"></A>over to the place annually from Sparta. A garrison of heavy infantry was 
<A NAME="922"></A>also regularly sent there, and great attention paid to the island, as it 
<A NAME="923"></A>was the landing-place for the merchantmen from Egypt and Libya, and at 
<A NAME="924"></A>the same time secured Laconia from the attacks of privateers from the sea, 
<A NAME="925"></A>at the only point where it is assailable, as the whole coast rises abruptly 
<A NAME="926"></A>towards the Sicilian and Cretan seas.
<A NAME="927"></A><BR><BR>Coming to land here with their armament, the Athenians with ten 
<A NAME="928"></A>ships and two thousand Milesian heavy infantry took the town of Scandea, 
<A NAME="929"></A>on the sea; and with the rest of their forces landing on the side of the 
<A NAME="930"></A>island looking towards Malea, went against the lower town of Cythera, where 
<A NAME="931"></A>they found all the inhabitants encamped. A battle ensuing, the Cytherians 
<A NAME="932"></A>held their ground for some little while, and then turned and fled into 
<A NAME="933"></A>the upper town, where they soon afterwards capitulated to Nicias and his 
<A NAME="934"></A>colleagues, agreeing to leave their fate to the decision of the Athenians, 
<A NAME="935"></A>their lives only being safe. A correspondence had previously been going 
<A NAME="936"></A>on between Nicias and certain of the inhabitants, which caused the surrender 
<A NAME="937"></A>to be effected more speedily, and upon terms more advantageous, present 
<A NAME="938"></A>and future, for the Cytherians; who would otherwise have been expelled 
<A NAME="939"></A>by the Athenians on account of their being Lacedaemonians and their island 
<A NAME="940"></A>being so near to Laconia. After the capitulation, the Athenians occupied 
<A NAME="941"></A>the town of Scandea near the harbour, and appointing a garrison for Cythera, 
<A NAME="942"></A>sailed to Asine, Helus, and most of the places on the sea, and making descents 
<A NAME="943"></A>and passing the night on shore at such spots as were convenient, continued 
<A NAME="944"></A>ravaging the country for about seven days.
<A NAME="945"></A><BR><BR>The Lacedaemonians seeing the Athenians masters of Cythera, and 
<A NAME="946"></A>expecting descents of the kind upon their coasts, nowhere opposed them 
<A NAME="947"></A>in force, but sent garrisons here and there through the country, consisting 
<A NAME="948"></A>of as many heavy infantry as the points menaced seemed to require, and 
<A NAME="949"></A>generally stood very much upon the defensive. After the severe and unexpected 
<A NAME="950"></A>blow that had befallen them in the island, the occupation of Pylos and 
<A NAME="951"></A>Cythera, and the apparition on every side of a war whose rapidity defied 
<A NAME="952"></A>precaution, they lived in constant fear of internal revolution, and now 
<A NAME="953"></A>took the unusual step of raising four hundred horse and a force of archers, 
<A NAME="954"></A>and became more timid than ever in military matters, finding themselves 
<A NAME="955"></A>involved in a maritime struggle, which their organization had never contemplated, 
<A NAME="956"></A>and that against Athenians, with whom an enterprise unattempted was always 
<A NAME="957"></A>looked upon as a success sacrificed. Besides this, their late numerous 
<A NAME="958"></A>reverses of fortune, coming close one upon another without any reason, 
<A NAME="959"></A>had thoroughly unnerved them, and they were always afraid of a second disaster 
<A NAME="960"></A>like that on the island, and thus scarcely dared to take the field, but 
<A NAME="961"></A>fancied that they could not stir without a blunder, for being new to the 
<A NAME="962"></A>experience of adversity they had lost all confidence in 
<A NAME="963"></A>themselves.
<A NAME="964"></A><BR><BR>Accordingly they now allowed the Athenians to ravage their seaboard, 
<A NAME="965"></A>without making any movement, the garrisons in whose neighbourhood the descents 
<A NAME="966"></A>were made always thinking their numbers insufficient, and sharing the general 
<A NAME="967"></A>feeling. A single garrison which ventured to resist, near Cotyrta and Aphrodisia, 
<A NAME="968"></A>struck terror by its charge into the scattered mob of light troops, but 
<A NAME="969"></A>retreated, upon being received by the heavy infantry, with the loss of 
<A NAME="970"></A>a few men and some arms, for which the Athenians set up a trophy, and then 
<A NAME="971"></A>sailed off to Cythera. From thence they sailed round to Epidaurus Limera, 
<A NAME="972"></A>ravaged part of the country, and so came to Thyrea in the Cynurian territory, 
<A NAME="973"></A>upon the Argive and Laconian border. This district had been given by its 
<A NAME="974"></A>Lacedaemonian owners to the expelled Aeginetans to inhabit, in return for 
<A NAME="975"></A>their good offices at the time of the earthquake and the rising of the 
<A NAME="976"></A>Helots; and also because, although subjects of Athens, they had always 
<A NAME="977"></A>sided with Lacedaemon.
<A NAME="978"></A><BR><BR>While the Athenians were still at sea, the Aeginetans evacuated 
<A NAME="979"></A>a fort which they were building upon the coast, and retreated into the 
<A NAME="980"></A>upper town where they lived, rather more than a mile from the sea. One 
<A NAME="981"></A>of the Lacedaemonian district garrisons which was helping them in the work, 
<A NAME="982"></A>refused to enter here with them at their entreaty, thinking it dangerous 
<A NAME="983"></A>to shut themselves up within the wall, and retiring to the high ground 
<A NAME="984"></A>remained quiet, not considering themselves a match for the enemy. Meanwhile 
<A NAME="985"></A>the Athenians landed, and instantly advanced with all their forces and 
<A NAME="986"></A>took Thyrea. The town they burnt, pillaging what was in it; the Aeginetans 
<A NAME="987"></A>who were not slain in action they took with them to Athens, with Tantalus, 
<A NAME="988"></A>son of Patrocles, their Lacedaemonian commander, who had been wounded and 
<A NAME="989"></A>taken prisoner. They also took with them a few men from Cythera whom they 
<A NAME="990"></A>thought it safest to remove. These the Athenians determined to lodge in 
<A NAME="991"></A>the islands: the rest of the Cytherians were to retain their lands and 
<A NAME="992"></A>pay four talents tribute; the Aeginetans captured to be all put to death, 
<A NAME="993"></A>on account of the old inveterate feud; and Tantalus to share the imprisonment 
<A NAME="994"></A>of the Lacedaemonians taken on the island.
<A NAME="995"></A><BR><BR>The same summer, the inhabitants of Camarina and Gela in Sicily 
<A NAME="996"></A>first made an armistice with each other, after which embassies from all 
<A NAME="997"></A>the other Sicilian cities assembled at Gela to try to bring about a pacification. 
<A NAME="998"></A>After many expressions of opinion on one side and the other, according 
<A NAME="999"></A>to the griefs and pretensions of the different parties complaining, Hermocrates, 
<A NAME="1000"></A>son of Hermon, a Syracusan, the most influential man among them, addressed 
<A NAME="1001"></A>the following words to the assembly:
<A NAME="1002"></A><BR><BR>"If I now address you, Sicilians, it is not because my city is 
<A NAME="1003"></A>the least in Sicily or the greatest sufferer by the war, but in order to 
<A NAME="1004"></A>state publicly what appears to me to be the best policy for the whole island. 
<A NAME="1005"></A>That war is an evil is a proposition so familiar to every one that it would 
<A NAME="1006"></A>be tedious to develop it. No one is forced to engage in it by ignorance, 
<A NAME="1007"></A>or kept out of it by fear, if he fancies there is anything to be gained 
<A NAME="1008"></A>by it. To the former the gain appears greater than the danger, while the 
<A NAME="1009"></A>latter would rather stand the risk than put up with any immediate sacrifice. 
<A NAME="1010"></A>But if both should happen to have chosen the wrong moment for acting in 
<A NAME="1011"></A>this way, advice to make peace would not be unserviceable; and this, if 
<A NAME="1012"></A>we did but see it, is just what we stand most in need of at the present 
<A NAME="1013"></A>juncture.
<A NAME="1014"></A><BR><BR>"I suppose that no one will dispute that we went to war at first 
<A NAME="1015"></A>in order to serve our own several interests, that we are now, in view of 
<A NAME="1016"></A>the same interests, debating how we can make peace; and that if we separate 
<A NAME="1017"></A>without having as we think our rights, we shall go to war again. And yet, 
<A NAME="1018"></A>as men of sense, we ought to see that our separate interests are not alone 
<A NAME="1019"></A>at stake in the present congress: there is also the question whether we 
<A NAME="1020"></A>have still time to save Sicily, the whole of which in my opinion is menaced 
<A NAME="1021"></A>by Athenian ambition; and we ought to find in the name of that people more 
<A NAME="1022"></A>imperious arguments for peace than any which I can advance, when we see 
<A NAME="1023"></A>the first power in Hellas watching our mistakes with the few ships that 
<A NAME="1024"></A>she has at present in our waters, and under the fair name of alliance speciously 
<A NAME="1025"></A>seeking to turn to account the natural hostility that exists between us. 
<A NAME="1026"></A>If we go to war, and call in to help us a people that are ready enough 
<A NAME="1027"></A>to carry their arms even where they are not invited; and if we injure ourselves 
<A NAME="1028"></A>at our own expense, and at the same time serve as the pioneers of their 
<A NAME="1029"></A>dominion, we may expect, when they see us worn out, that they will one 
<A NAME="1030"></A>day come with a larger armament, and seek to bring all of us into 
<A NAME="1031"></A>subjection.
<A NAME="1032"></A><BR><BR>"And yet as sensible men, if we call in allies and court danger, 
<A NAME="1033"></A>it should be in order to enrich our different countries with new acquisitions, 
<A NAME="1034"></A>and not to ruin what they possess already; and we should understand that 
<A NAME="1035"></A>the intestine discords which are so fatal to communities generally, will 
<A NAME="1036"></A>be equally so to Sicily, if we, its inhabitants, absorbed in our local 
<A NAME="1037"></A>quarrels, neglect the common enemy. These considerations should reconcile 
<A NAME="1038"></A>individual with individual, and city with city, and unite us in a common 
<A NAME="1039"></A>effort to save the whole of Sicily. Nor should any one imagine that the 
<A NAME="1040"></A>Dorians only are enemies of Athens, while the Chalcidian race is secured 
<A NAME="1041"></A>by its Ionian blood; the attack in question is not inspired by hatred of 
<A NAME="1042"></A>one of two nationalities, but by a desire for the good things in Sicily, 
<A NAME="1043"></A>the common property of us all. This is proved by the Athenian reception 
<A NAME="1044"></A>of the Chalcidian invitation: an ally who has never given them any assistance 
<A NAME="1045"></A>whatever, at once receives from them almost more than the treaty entitles 
<A NAME="1046"></A>him to. That the Athenians should cherish this ambition and practise this 
<A NAME="1047"></A>policy is very excusable; and I do not blame those who wish to rule, but 
<A NAME="1048"></A>those who are over-ready to serve. It is just as much in men's nature to 
<A NAME="1049"></A>rule those who submit to them, as it is to resist those who molest them; 
<A NAME="1050"></A>one is not less invariable than the other. Meanwhile all who see these 
<A NAME="1051"></A>dangers and refuse to provide for them properly, or who have come here 
<A NAME="1052"></A>without having made up their minds that our first duty is to unite to get 
<A NAME="1053"></A>rid of the common peril, are mistaken. The quickest way to be rid of it 
<A NAME="1054"></A>is to make peace with each other; since the Athenians menace us not from 
<A NAME="1055"></A>their own country, but from that of those who invited them here. In this 
<A NAME="1056"></A>way instead of war issuing in war, peace quietly ends our quarrels; and 
<A NAME="1057"></A>the guests who come hither under fair pretences for bad ends, will have 
<A NAME="1058"></A>good reason for going away without having attained them.
<A NAME="1059"></A><BR><BR>"So far as regards the Athenians, such are the great advantages 
<A NAME="1060"></A>proved inherent in a wise policy. Independently of this, in the face of 
<A NAME="1061"></A>the universal consent, that peace is the first of blessings, how can we 
<A NAME="1062"></A>refuse to make it amongst ourselves; or do you not think that the good 
<A NAME="1063"></A>which you have, and the ills that you complain of, would be better preserved 
<A NAME="1064"></A>and cured by quiet than by war; that peace has its honours and splendours 
<A NAME="1065"></A>of a less perilous kind, not to mention the numerous other blessings that 
<A NAME="1066"></A>one might dilate on, with the not less numerous miseries of war? These 
<A NAME="1067"></A>considerations should teach you not to disregard my words, but rather to 
<A NAME="1068"></A>look in them every one for his own safety. If there be any here who feels 
<A NAME="1069"></A>certain either by right or might to effect his object, let not this surprise 
<A NAME="1070"></A>be to him too severe a disappointment. Let him remember that many before 
<A NAME="1071"></A>now have tried to chastise a wrongdoer, and failing to punish their enemy 
<A NAME="1072"></A>have not even saved themselves; while many who have trusted in force to 
<A NAME="1073"></A>gain an advantage, instead of gaining anything more, have been doomed to 
<A NAME="1074"></A>lose what they had. Vengeance is not necessarily successful because wrong 
<A NAME="1075"></A>has been done, or strength sure because it is confident; but the incalculable 
<A NAME="1076"></A>element in the future exercises the widest influence, and is the most treacherous, 
<A NAME="1077"></A>and yet in fact the most useful of all things, as it frightens us all equally, 
<A NAME="1078"></A>and thus makes us consider before attacking each other.
<A NAME="1079"></A><BR><BR>"Let us therefore now allow the undefined fear of this unknown 
<A NAME="1080"></A>future, and the immediate terror of the Athenians' presence, to produce
