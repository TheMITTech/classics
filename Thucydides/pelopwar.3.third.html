<A NAME="10"></A><B>Chapter IX</B>
<A NAME="11"></A><BR><BR><B>Fourth and Fifth Years of the War -</B> <B>Revolt of 
<A NAME="12"></A>Mitylene</B>
<A NAME="13"></A><BR><BR>The next summer, just as the corn was getting ripe, the Peloponnesians 
<A NAME="14"></A>and their allies invaded Attica under the command of Archidamus, son of 
<A NAME="15"></A>Zeuxidamus, king of the Lacedaemonians, and sat down and ravaged the land; 
<A NAME="16"></A>the Athenian horse as usual attacking them, wherever it was practicable, 
<A NAME="17"></A>and preventing the mass of the light troops from advancing from their camp 
<A NAME="18"></A>and wasting the parts near the city. After staying the time for which they 
<A NAME="19"></A>had taken provisions, the invaders retired and dispersed to their several 
<A NAME="20"></A>cities.
<A NAME="21"></A><BR><BR>Immediately after the invasion of the Peloponnesians all Lesbos, 
<A NAME="22"></A>except Methymna, revolted from the Athenians. The Lesbians had wished to 
<A NAME="23"></A>revolt even before the war, but the Lacedaemonians would not receive them; 
<A NAME="24"></A>and yet now when they did revolt, they were compelled to do so sooner than 
<A NAME="25"></A>they had intended. While they were waiting until the moles for their harbours 
<A NAME="26"></A>and the ships and walls that they had in building should be finished, and 
<A NAME="27"></A>for the arrival of archers and corn and other things that they were engaged 
<A NAME="28"></A>in fetching from the Pontus, the Tenedians, with whom they were at enmity, 
<A NAME="29"></A>and the Methymnians, and some factious persons in Mitylene itself, who 
<A NAME="30"></A>were proxeni of Athens, informed the Athenians that the Mitylenians were 
<A NAME="31"></A>forcibly uniting the island under their sovereignty, and that the preparations 
<A NAME="32"></A>about which they were so active, were all concerted with the Boeotians 
<A NAME="33"></A>their kindred and the Lacedaemonians with a view to a revolt, and that, 
<A NAME="34"></A>unless they were immediately prevented, Athens would lose 
<A NAME="35"></A>Lesbos.
<A NAME="36"></A><BR><BR>However, the Athenians, distressed by the plague, and by the war 
<A NAME="37"></A>that had recently broken out and was now raging, thought it a serious matter 
<A NAME="38"></A>to add Lesbos with its fleet and untouched resources to the list of their 
<A NAME="39"></A>enemies; and at first would not believe the charge, giving too much weight 
<A NAME="40"></A>to their wish that it might not be true. But when an embassy which they 
<A NAME="41"></A>sent had failed to persuade the Mitylenians to give up the union and preparations 
<A NAME="42"></A>complained of, they became alarmed, and resolved to strike the first blow. 
<A NAME="43"></A>They accordingly suddenly sent off forty ships that had been got ready 
<A NAME="44"></A>to sail round Peloponnese, under the command of Cleippides, son of Deinias, 
<A NAME="45"></A>and two others; word having been brought them of a festival in honour of 
<A NAME="46"></A>the Malean Apollo outside the town, which is kept by the whole people of 
<A NAME="47"></A>Mitylene, and at which, if haste were made, they might hope to take them 
<A NAME="48"></A>by surprise. If this plan succeeded, well and good; if not, they were to 
<A NAME="49"></A>order the Mitylenians to deliver up their ships and to pull down their 
<A NAME="50"></A>walls, and if they did not obey, to declare war. The ships accordingly 
<A NAME="51"></A>set out; the ten galleys, forming the contingent of the Mitylenians present 
<A NAME="52"></A>with the fleet according to the terms of the alliance, being detained by 
<A NAME="53"></A>the Athenians, and their crews placed in custody. However, the Mitylenians 
<A NAME="54"></A>were informed of the expedition by a man who crossed from Athens to Euboea, 
<A NAME="55"></A>and going overland to Geraestus, sailed from thence by a merchantman which 
<A NAME="56"></A>he found on the point of putting to sea, and so arrived at Mitylene the 
<A NAME="57"></A>third day after leaving Athens. The Mitylenians accordingly refrained from 
<A NAME="58"></A>going out to the temple at Malea, and moreover barricaded and kept guard 
<A NAME="59"></A>round the half-finished parts of their walls and harbours.
<A NAME="60"></A><BR><BR>When the Athenians sailed in not long after and saw how things 
<A NAME="61"></A>stood, the generals delivered their orders, and upon the Mitylenians refusing 
<A NAME="62"></A>to obey, commenced hostilities. The Mitylenians, thus compelled to go to 
<A NAME="63"></A>war without notice and unprepared, at first sailed out with their fleet 
<A NAME="64"></A>and made some show of fighting, a little in front of the harbour; but being 
<A NAME="65"></A>driven back by the Athenian ships, immediately offered to treat with the 
<A NAME="66"></A>commanders, wishing, if possible, to get the ships away for the present 
<A NAME="67"></A>upon any tolerable terms. The Athenian commanders accepted their offers, 
<A NAME="68"></A>being themselves fearful that they might not be able to cope with the whole 
<A NAME="69"></A>of Lesbos; and an armistice having been concluded, the Mitylenians sent 
<A NAME="70"></A>to Athens one of the informers, already repentant of his conduct, and others 
<A NAME="71"></A>with him, to try to persuade the Athenians of the innocence of their intentions 
<A NAME="72"></A>and to get the fleet recalled. In the meantime, having no great hope of 
<A NAME="73"></A>a favourable answer from Athens, they also sent off a galley with envoys 
<A NAME="74"></A>to Lacedaemon, unobserved by the Athenian fleet which was anchored at Malea 
<A NAME="75"></A>to the north of the town.
<A NAME="76"></A><BR><BR>While these envoys, reaching Lacedaemon after a difficult journey 
<A NAME="77"></A>across the open sea, were negotiating for succours being sent them, the 
<A NAME="78"></A>ambassadors from Athens returned without having effected anything; and 
<A NAME="79"></A>hostilities were at once begun by the Mitylenians and the rest of Lesbos, 
<A NAME="80"></A>with the exception of the Methymnians, who came to the aid of the Athenians 
<A NAME="81"></A>with the Imbrians and Lemnians and some few of the other allies. The Mitylenians 
<A NAME="82"></A>made a sortie with all their forces against the Athenian camp; and a battle 
<A NAME="83"></A>ensued, in which they gained some slight advantage, but retired notwithstanding, 
<A NAME="84"></A>not feeling sufficient confidence in themselves to spend the night upon 
<A NAME="85"></A>the field. After this they kept quiet, wishing to wait for the chance of 
<A NAME="86"></A>reinforcements arriving from Peloponnese before making a second venture, 
<A NAME="87"></A>being encouraged by the arrival of Meleas, a Laconian, and Hermaeondas, 
<A NAME="88"></A>a Theban, who had been sent off before the insurrection but had been unable 
<A NAME="89"></A>to reach Lesbos before the Athenian expedition, and who now stole in in 
<A NAME="90"></A>a galley after the battle, and advised them to send another galley and 
<A NAME="91"></A>envoys back with them, which the Mitylenians accordingly 
<A NAME="92"></A>did.
<A NAME="93"></A><BR><BR>Meanwhile the Athenians, greatly encouraged by the inaction of 
<A NAME="94"></A>the Mitylenians, summoned allies to their aid, who came in all the quicker 
<A NAME="95"></A>from seeing so little vigour displayed by the Lesbians, and bringing round 
<A NAME="96"></A>their ships to a new station to the south of the town, fortified two camps, 
<A NAME="97"></A>one on each side of the city, and instituted a blockade of both the harbours. 
<A NAME="98"></A>The sea was thus closed against the Mitylenians, who, however, commanded 
<A NAME="99"></A>the whole country, with the rest of the Lesbians who had now joined them; 
<A NAME="100"></A>the Athenians only holding a limited area round their camps, and using 
<A NAME="101"></A>Malea more as the station for their ships and their 
<A NAME="102"></A>market.
<A NAME="103"></A><BR><BR>While the war went on in this way at Mitylene, the Athenians, about 
<A NAME="104"></A>the same time in this summer, also sent thirty ships to Peloponnese under 
<A NAME="105"></A>Asopius, son of Phormio; the Acarnanians insisting that the commander sent 
<A NAME="106"></A>should be some son or relative of Phormio. As the ships coasted along shore 
<A NAME="107"></A>they ravaged the seaboard of Laconia; after which Asopius sent most of 
<A NAME="108"></A>the fleet home, and himself went on with twelve vessels to Naupactus, and 
<A NAME="109"></A>afterwards raising the whole Acarnanian population made an expedition against 
<A NAME="110"></A>Oeniadae, the fleet sailing along the Achelous, while the army laid waste 
<A NAME="111"></A>the country. The inhabitants, however, showing no signs of submitting, 
<A NAME="112"></A>he dismissed the land forces and himself sailed to Leucas, and making a 
<A NAME="113"></A>descent upon Nericus was cut off during his retreat, and most of his troops 
<A NAME="114"></A>with him, by the people in those parts aided by some coastguards; after 
<A NAME="115"></A>which the Athenians sailed away, recovering their dead from the Leucadians 
<A NAME="116"></A>under truce.
<A NAME="117"></A><BR><BR>Meanwhile the envoys of the Mitylenians sent out in the first ship 
<A NAME="118"></A>were told by the Lacedaemonians to come to Olympia, in order that the rest 
<A NAME="119"></A>of the allies might hear them and decide upon their matter, and so they 
<A NAME="120"></A>journeyed thither. It was the Olympiad in which the Rhodian Dorieus gained 
<A NAME="121"></A>his second victory, and the envoys having been introduced to make their 
<A NAME="122"></A>speech after the festival, spoke as follows:
<A NAME="123"></A><BR><BR>"Lacedaemonians and allies, the rule established among the Hellenes 
<A NAME="124"></A>is not unknown to us. Those who revolt in war and forsake their former 
<A NAME="125"></A>confederacy are favourably regarded by those who receive them, in so far 
<A NAME="126"></A>as they are of use to them, but otherwise are thought less well of, through 
<A NAME="127"></A>being considered traitors to their former friends. Nor is this an unfair 
<A NAME="128"></A>way of judging, where the rebels and the power from whom they secede are 
<A NAME="129"></A>at one in policy and sympathy, and a match for each other in resources 
<A NAME="130"></A>and power, and where no reasonable ground exists for the rebellion. But 
<A NAME="131"></A>with us and the Athenians this was not the case; and no one need think 
<A NAME="132"></A>the worse of us for revolting from them in danger, after having been honoured 
<A NAME="133"></A>by them in time of peace.
<A NAME="134"></A><BR><BR>"Justice and honesty will be the first topics of our speech, especially 
<A NAME="135"></A>as we are asking for alliance; because we know that there can never be 
<A NAME="136"></A>any solid friendship between individuals, or union between communities 
<A NAME="137"></A>that is worth the name, unless the parties be persuaded of each other's 
<A NAME="138"></A>honesty, and be generally congenial the one to the other; since from difference 
<A NAME="139"></A>in feeling springs also difference in conduct. Between ourselves and the 
<A NAME="140"></A>Athenians alliance began, when you withdrew from the Median War and they 
<A NAME="141"></A>remained to finish the business. But we did not become allies of the Athenians 
<A NAME="142"></A>for the subjugation of the Hellenes, but allies of the Hellenes for their 
<A NAME="143"></A>liberation from the Mede; and as long as the Athenians led us fairly we 
<A NAME="144"></A>followed them loyally; but when we saw them relax their hostility to the 
<A NAME="145"></A>Mede, to try to compass the subjection of the allies, then our apprehensions 
<A NAME="146"></A>began. Unable, however, to unite and defend themselves, on account of the 
<A NAME="147"></A>number of confederates that had votes, all the allies were enslaved, except 
<A NAME="148"></A>ourselves and the Chians, who continued to send our contingents as independent 
<A NAME="149"></A>and nominally free. Trust in Athens as a leader, however, we could no longer 
<A NAME="150"></A>feel, judging by the examples already given; it being unlikely that she 
<A NAME="151"></A>would reduce our fellow confederates, and not do the same by us who were 
<A NAME="152"></A>left, if ever she had the power.
<A NAME="153"></A><BR><BR>"Had we all been still independent, we could have had more faith 
<A NAME="154"></A>in their not attempting any change; but the greater number being their 
<A NAME="155"></A>subjects, while they were treating us as equals, they would naturally chafe 
<A NAME="156"></A>under this solitary instance of independence as contrasted with the submission 
<A NAME="157"></A>of the majority; particularly as they daily grew more powerful, and we 
<A NAME="158"></A>more destitute. Now the only sure basis of an alliance is for each party 
<A NAME="159"></A>to be equally afraid of the other; he who would like to encroach is then 
<A NAME="160"></A>deterred by the reflection that he will not have odds in his favour. Again, 
<A NAME="161"></A>if we were left independent, it was only because they thought they saw 
<A NAME="162"></A>their way to empire more clearly by specious language and by the paths 
<A NAME="163"></A>of policy than by those of force. Not only were we useful as evidence that 
<A NAME="164"></A>powers who had votes, like themselves, would not, surely, join them in 
<A NAME="165"></A>their expeditions, against their will, without the party attacked being 
<A NAME="166"></A>in the wrong; but the same system also enabled them to lead the stronger 
<A NAME="167"></A>states against the weaker first, and so to leave the former to the last, 
<A NAME="168"></A>stripped of their natural allies, and less capable of resistance. But if 
<A NAME="169"></A>they had begun with us, while all the states still had their resources 
<A NAME="170"></A>under their own control, and there was a centre to rally round, the work 
<A NAME="171"></A>of subjugation would have been found less easy. Besides this, our navy 
<A NAME="172"></A>gave them some apprehension: it was always possible that it might unite 
<A NAME="173"></A>with you or with some other power, and become dangerous to Athens. The 
<A NAME="174"></A>court which we paid to their commons and its leaders for the time being 
<A NAME="175"></A>also helped us to maintain our independence. However, we did not expect 
<A NAME="176"></A>to be able to do so much longer, if this war had not broken out, from the 
<A NAME="177"></A>examples that we had had of their conduct to the rest.
<A NAME="178"></A><BR><BR>"How then could we put our trust in such friendship or freedom 
<A NAME="179"></A>as we had here? We accepted each other against our inclination; fear made 
<A NAME="180"></A>them court us in war, and us them in peace; sympathy, the ordinary basis 
<A NAME="181"></A>of confidence, had its place supplied by terror, fear having more share 
<A NAME="182"></A>than friendship in detaining us in the alliance; and the first party that 
<A NAME="183"></A>should be encouraged by the hope of impunity was certain to break faith 
<A NAME="184"></A>with the other. So that to condemn us for being the first to break off, 
<A NAME="185"></A>because they delay the blow that we dread, instead of ourselves delaying 
<A NAME="186"></A>to know for certain whether it will be dealt or not, is to take a false 
<A NAME="187"></A>view of the case. For if we were equally able with them to meet their plots 
<A NAME="188"></A>and imitate their delay, we should be their equals and should be under 
<A NAME="189"></A>no necessity of being their subjects; but the liberty of offence being 
<A NAME="190"></A>always theirs, that of defence ought clearly to be ours.
<A NAME="191"></A><BR><BR>"Such, Lacedaemonians and allies, are the grounds and the reasons 
<A NAME="192"></A>of our revolt; clear enough to convince our hearers of the fairness of 
<A NAME="193"></A>our conduct, and sufficient to alarm ourselves, and to make us turn to 
<A NAME="194"></A>some means of safety. This we wished to do long ago, when we sent to you 
<A NAME="195"></A>on the subject while the peace yet lasted, but were balked by your refusing 
<A NAME="196"></A>to receive us; and now, upon the Boeotians inviting us, we at once responded 
<A NAME="197"></A>to the call, and decided upon a twofold revolt, from the Hellenes and from 
<A NAME="198"></A>the Athenians, not to aid the latter in harming the former, but to join 
<A NAME="199"></A>in their liberation, and not to allow the Athenians in the end to destroy 
<A NAME="200"></A>us, but to act in time against them. Our revolt, however, has taken place 
<A NAME="201"></A>prematurely and without preparation- a fact which makes it all the more 
<A NAME="202"></A>incumbent on you to receive us into alliance and to send us speedy relief, 
<A NAME="203"></A>in order to show that you support your friends, and at the same time do 
<A NAME="204"></A>harm to your enemies. You have an opportunity such as you never had before. 
<A NAME="205"></A>Disease and expenditure have wasted the Athenians: their ships are either 
<A NAME="206"></A>cruising round your coasts, or engaged in blockading us; and it is not 
<A NAME="207"></A>probable that they will have any to spare, if you invade them a second 
<A NAME="208"></A>time this summer by sea and land; but they will either offer no resistance 
<A NAME="209"></A>to your vessels, or withdraw from both our shores. Nor must it be thought 
<A NAME="210"></A>that this is a case of putting yourselves into danger for a country which 
<A NAME="211"></A>is not yours. Lesbos may appear far off, but when help is wanted she will 
<A NAME="212"></A>be found near enough. It is not in Attica that the war will be decided, 
<A NAME="213"></A>as some imagine, but in the countries by which Attica is supported; and 
<A NAME="214"></A>the Athenian revenue is drawn from the allies, and will become still larger 
<A NAME="215"></A>if they reduce us; as not only will no other state revolt, but our resources 
<A NAME="216"></A>will be added to theirs, and we shall be treated worse than those that 
<A NAME="217"></A>were enslaved before. But if you will frankly support us, you will add 
<A NAME="218"></A>to your side a state that has a large navy, which is your great want; you 
<A NAME="219"></A>will smooth the way to the overthrow of the Athenians by depriving them 
<A NAME="220"></A>of their allies, who will be greatly encouraged to come over; and you will 
<A NAME="221"></A>free yourselves from the imputation made against you, of not supporting 
<A NAME="222"></A>insurrection. In short, only show yourselves as liberators, and you may 
<A NAME="223"></A>count upon having the advantage in the war.
<A NAME="224"></A><BR><BR>"Respect, therefore, the hopes placed in you by the Hellenes, and 
<A NAME="225"></A>that Olympian Zeus, in whose temple we stand as very suppliants; become 
<A NAME="226"></A>the allies and defenders of the Mitylenians, and do not sacrifice us, who 
<A NAME="227"></A>put our lives upon the hazard, in a cause in which general good will result 
<A NAME="228"></A>to all from our success, and still more general harm if we fail through 
<A NAME="229"></A>your refusing to help us; but be the men that the Hellenes think you, and 
<A NAME="230"></A>our fears desire."
<A NAME="231"></A><BR><BR>Such were the words of the Mitylenians. After hearing them out, 
<A NAME="232"></A>the Lacedaemonians and confederates granted what they urged, and took the 
<A NAME="233"></A>Lesbians into alliance, and deciding in favour of the invasion of Attica, 
<A NAME="234"></A>told the allies present to march as quickly as possible to the Isthmus 
<A NAME="235"></A>with two-thirds of their forces; and arriving there first themselves, got 
<A NAME="236"></A>ready hauling machines to carry their ships across from Corinth to the 
<A NAME="237"></A>sea on the side of Athens, in order to make their attack by sea and land 
<A NAME="238"></A>at once. However, the zeal which they displayed was not imitated by the 
<A NAME="239"></A>rest of the confederates, who came in but slowly, being engaged in harvesting 
<A NAME="240"></A>their corn and sick of making expeditions.
<A NAME="241"></A><BR><BR>Meanwhile the Athenians, aware that the preparations of the enemy 
<A NAME="242"></A>were due to his conviction of their weakness, and wishing to show him that 
<A NAME="243"></A>he was mistaken, and that they were able, without moving the Lesbian fleet, 
<A NAME="244"></A>to repel with ease that with which they were menaced from Peloponnese, 
<A NAME="245"></A>manned a hundred ships by embarking the citizens of Athens, except the 
<A NAME="246"></A>knights and Pentacosiomedimni, and the resident aliens; and putting out 
<A NAME="247"></A>to the Isthmus, displayed their power, and made descents upon Peloponnese 
<A NAME="248"></A>wherever they pleased. A disappointment so signal made the Lacedaemonians 
<A NAME="249"></A>think that the Lesbians had not spoken the truth; and embarrassed by the 
<A NAME="250"></A>non-appearance of the confederates, coupled with the news that the thirty 
<A NAME="251"></A>ships round Peloponnese were ravaging the lands near Sparta, they went 
<A NAME="252"></A>back home. Afterwards, however, they got ready a fleet to send to Lesbos, 
<A NAME="253"></A>and ordering a total of forty ships from the different cities in the league, 
<A NAME="254"></A>appointed Alcidas to command the expedition in his capacity of high admiral. 
<A NAME="255"></A>Meanwhile the Athenians in the hundred ships, upon seeing the Lacedaemonians 
<A NAME="256"></A>go home, went home likewise.
<A NAME="257"></A><BR><BR>If, at the time that this fleet was at sea, Athens had almost the 
<A NAME="258"></A>largest number of first-rate ships in commission that she ever possessed 
<A NAME="259"></A>at any one moment, she had as many or even more when the war began. At 
<A NAME="260"></A>that time one hundred guarded Attica, Euboea, and Salamis; a hundred more 
<A NAME="261"></A>were cruising round Peloponnese, besides those employed at Potidaea and 
<A NAME="262"></A>in other places; making a grand total of two hundred and fifty vessels 
<A NAME="263"></A>employed on active service in a single summer. It was this, with Potidaea, 
<A NAME="264"></A>that most exhausted her revenues- Potidaea being blockaded by a force of 
<A NAME="265"></A>heavy infantry (each drawing two drachmae a day, one for himself and another 
<A NAME="266"></A>for his servant), which amounted to three thousand at first, and was kept 
<A NAME="267"></A>at this number down to the end of the siege; besides sixteen hundred with 
<A NAME="268"></A>Phormio who went away before it was over; and the ships being all paid 
<A NAME="269"></A>at the same rate. In this way her money was wasted at first; and this was 
<A NAME="270"></A>the largest number of ships ever manned by her.
<A NAME="271"></A><BR><BR>About the same time that the Lacedaemonians were at the Isthmus, 
<A NAME="272"></A>the Mitylenians marched by land with their mercenaries against Methymna, 
<A NAME="273"></A>which they thought to gain by treachery. After assaulting the town, and 
<A NAME="274"></A>not meeting with the success that they anticipated, they withdrew to Antissa, 
<A NAME="275"></A>Pyrrha, and Eresus; and taking measures for the better security of these 
<A NAME="276"></A>towns and strengthening their walls, hastily returned home. After their 
<A NAME="277"></A>departure the Methymnians marched against Antissa, but were defeated in 
<A NAME="278"></A>a sortie by the Antissians and their mercenaries, and retreated in haste 
<A NAME="279"></A>after losing many of their number. Word of this reaching Athens, and the 
<A NAME="280"></A>Athenians learning that the Mitylenians were masters of the country and 
<A NAME="281"></A>their own soldiers unable to hold them in check, they sent out about the 
<A NAME="282"></A>beginning of autumn Paches, son of Epicurus, to take the command, and a 
<A NAME="283"></A>thousand Athenian heavy infantry; who worked their own passage and, arriving 
<A NAME="284"></A>at Mitylene, built a single wall all round it, forts being erected at some 
<A NAME="285"></A>of the strongest points. Mitylene was thus blockaded strictly on both sides, 
<A NAME="286"></A>by land and by sea; and winter now drew near.
<A NAME="287"></A><BR><BR>The Athenians needing money for the siege, although they had for 
<A NAME="288"></A>the first time raised a contribution of two hundred talents from their 
<A NAME="289"></A>own citizens, now sent out twelve ships to levy subsidies from their allies, 
<A NAME="290"></A>with Lysicles and four others in command. After cruising to different places 
<A NAME="291"></A>and laying them under contribution, Lysicles went up the country from Myus, 
<A NAME="292"></A>in Caria, across the plain of the Meander, as far as the hill of Sandius; 
<A NAME="293"></A>and being attacked by the Carians and the people of Anaia, was slain with 
<A NAME="294"></A>many of his soldiers.
<A NAME="295"></A><BR><BR>The same winter the Plataeans, who were still being besieged by 
<A NAME="296"></A>the Peloponnesians and Boeotians, distressed by the failure of their provisions, 
<A NAME="297"></A>and seeing no hope of relief from Athens, nor any other means of safety, 
<A NAME="298"></A>formed a scheme with the Athenians besieged with them for escaping, if 
<A NAME="299"></A>possible, by forcing their way over the enemy's walls; the attempt having 
<A NAME="300"></A>been suggested by Theaenetus, son of Tolmides, a soothsayer, and Eupompides, 
<A NAME="301"></A>son of Daimachus, one of their generals. At first all were to join: afterwards, 
<A NAME="302"></A>half hung back, thinking the risk great; about two hundred and twenty, 
<A NAME="303"></A>however, voluntarily persevered in the attempt, which was carried out in 
<A NAME="304"></A>the following way. Ladders were made to match the height of the enemy's 
<A NAME="305"></A>wall, which they measured by the layers of bricks, the side turned towards 
<A NAME="306"></A>them not being thoroughly whitewashed. These were counted by many persons 
<A NAME="307"></A>at once; and though some might miss the right calculation, most would hit 
<A NAME="308"></A>upon it, particularly as they counted over and over again, and were no 
<A NAME="309"></A>great way from the wall, but could see it easily enough for their purpose. 
<A NAME="310"></A>The length required for the ladders was thus obtained, being calculated 
<A NAME="311"></A>from the breadth of the brick.
<A NAME="312"></A><BR><BR>Now the wall of the Peloponnesians was constructed as follows. 
<A NAME="313"></A>It consisted of two lines drawn round the place, one against the Plataeans, 
<A NAME="314"></A>the other against any attack on the outside from Athens, about sixteen 
<A NAME="315"></A>feet apart. The intermediate space of sixteen feet was occupied by huts 
<A NAME="316"></A>portioned out among the soldiers on guard, and built in one block, so as 
<A NAME="317"></A>to give the appearance of a single thick wall with battlements on either 
<A NAME="318"></A>side. At intervals of every ten battlements were towers of considerable 
<A NAME="319"></A>size, and the same breadth as the wall, reaching right across from its 
<A NAME="320"></A>inner to its outer face, with no means of passing except through the middle. 
<A NAME="321"></A>Accordingly on stormy and wet nights the battlements were deserted, and 
<A NAME="322"></A>guard kept from the towers, which were not far apart and roofed in 
<A NAME="323"></A>above.
<A NAME="324"></A><BR><BR>Such being the structure of the wall by which the Plataeans were 
<A NAME="325"></A>blockaded, when their preparations were completed, they waited for a stormy 
<A NAME="326"></A>night of wind and rain and without any moon, and then set out, guided by 
<A NAME="327"></A>the authors of the enterprise. Crossing first the ditch that ran round 
<A NAME="328"></A>the town, they next gained the wall of the enemy unperceived by the sentinels, 
<A NAME="329"></A>who did not see them in the darkness, or hear them, as the wind drowned 
<A NAME="330"></A>with its roar the noise of their approach; besides which they kept a good 
<A NAME="331"></A>way off from each other, that they might not be betrayed by the clash of 
<A NAME="332"></A>their weapons. They were also lightly equipped, and had only the left foot 
<A NAME="333"></A>shod to preserve them from slipping in the mire. They came up to the battlements 
<A NAME="334"></A>at one of the intermediate spaces where they knew them to be unguarded: 
<A NAME="335"></A>those who carried the ladders went first and planted them; next twelve 
<A NAME="336"></A>light-armed soldiers with only a dagger and a breastplate mounted, led 
<A NAME="337"></A>by Ammias, son of Coroebus, who was the first on the wall; his followers 
<A NAME="338"></A>getting up after him and going six to each of the towers. After these came 
<A NAME="339"></A>another party of light troops armed with spears, whose shields, that they 
<A NAME="340"></A>might advance the easier, were carried by men behind, who were to hand 
<A NAME="341"></A>them to them when they found themselves in presence of the enemy. After 
<A NAME="342"></A>a good many had mounted they were discovered by the sentinels in the towers, 
<A NAME="343"></A>by the noise made by a tile which was knocked down by one of the Plataeans 
<A NAME="344"></A>as he was laying hold of the battlements. The alarm was instantly given, 
<A NAME="345"></A>and the troops rushed to the wall, not knowing the nature of the danger, 
<A NAME="346"></A>owing to the dark night and stormy weather; the Plataeans in the town having 
<A NAME="347"></A>also chosen that moment to make a sortie against the wall of the Peloponnesians 
<A NAME="348"></A>upon the side opposite to that on which their men were getting over, in 
<A NAME="349"></A>order to divert the attention of the besiegers. Accordingly they remained 
<A NAME="350"></A>distracted at their several posts, without any venturing to stir to give 
<A NAME="351"></A>help from his own station, and at a loss to guess what was going on. Meanwhile 
<A NAME="352"></A>the three hundred set aside for service on emergencies went outside the 
<A NAME="353"></A>wall in the direction of the alarm. Fire-signals of an attack were also 
<A NAME="354"></A>raised towards Thebes; but the Plataeans in the town at once displayed 
<A NAME="355"></A>a number of others, prepared beforehand for this very purpose, in order 
<A NAME="356"></A>to render the enemy's signals unintelligible, and to prevent his friends 
<A NAME="357"></A>getting a true idea of what was passing and coming to his aid before their 
<A NAME="358"></A>comrades who had gone out should have made good their escape and be in 
<A NAME="359"></A>safety.
<A NAME="360"></A><BR><BR>Meanwhile the first of the scaling party that had got up, after 
<A NAME="361"></A>carrying both the towers and putting the sentinels to the sword, posted 
<A NAME="362"></A>themselves inside to prevent any one coming through against them; and rearing 
<A NAME="363"></A>ladders from the wall, sent several men up on the towers, and from their 
<A NAME="364"></A>summit and base kept in check all of the enemy that came up, with their 
<A NAME="365"></A>missiles, while their main body planted a number of ladders against the 
<A NAME="366"></A>wall, and knocking down the battlements, passed over between the towers; 
<A NAME="367"></A>each as soon as he had got over taking up his station at the edge of the 
<A NAME="368"></A>ditch, and plying from thence with arrows and darts any who came along 
<A NAME="369"></A>the wall to stop the passage of his comrades. When all were over, the party 
<A NAME="370"></A>on the towers came down, the last of them not without difficulty, and proceeded 
<A NAME="371"></A>to the ditch, just as the three hundred came up carrying torches. The Plataeans, 
<A NAME="372"></A>standing on the edge of the ditch in the dark, had a good view of their 
<A NAME="373"></A>opponents, and discharged their arrows and darts upon the unarmed parts 
<A NAME="374"></A>of their bodies, while they themselves could not be so well seen in the 
<A NAME="375"></A>obscurity for the torches; and thus even the last of them got over the 
<A NAME="376"></A>ditch, though not without effort and difficulty; as ice had formed in it, 
<A NAME="377"></A>not strong enough to walk upon, but of that watery kind which generally 
<A NAME="378"></A>comes with a wind more east than north, and the snow which this wind had 
<A NAME="379"></A>caused to fall during the night had made the water in the ditch rise, so. 
<A NAME="380"></A>that they could scarcely breast it as they crossed. However, it was mainly 
<A NAME="381"></A>the violence of the storm that enabled them to effect their escape at 
<A NAME="382"></A>all.
<A NAME="383"></A><BR><BR>Starting from the ditch, the Plataeans went all together along 
<A NAME="384"></A>the road leading to Thebes, keeping the chapel of the hero Androcrates 
<A NAME="385"></A>upon their right; considering that the last road which the Peloponnesians 
<A NAME="386"></A>would suspect them of having taken would be that towards their enemies' 
<A NAME="387"></A>country. Indeed they could see them pursuing with torches upon the Athens 
<A NAME="388"></A>road towards Cithaeron and Druoskephalai or Oakheads. After going for rather 
<A NAME="389"></A>more than half a mile upon the road to Thebes, the Plataeans turned off 
<A NAME="390"></A>and took that leading to the mountain, to Erythrae and Hysiae, and reaching 
<A NAME="391"></A>the hills, made good their escape to Athens, two hundred and twelve men 
<A NAME="392"></A>in all; some of their number having turned back into the town before getting 
<A NAME="393"></A>over the wall, and one archer having been taken prisoner at the outer ditch. 
<A NAME="394"></A>Meanwhile the Peloponnesians gave up the pursuit and returned to their 
<A NAME="395"></A>posts; and the Plataeans in the town, knowing nothing of what had passed, 
<A NAME="396"></A>and informed by those who had turned back that not a man had escaped, sent 
<A NAME="397"></A>out a herald as soon as it was day to make a truce for the recovery of 
<A NAME="398"></A>the dead bodies, and then, learning the truth, desisted. In this way the 
<A NAME="399"></A>Plataean party got over and were saved.
<A NAME="400"></A><BR><BR>Towards the close of the same winter, Salaethus, a Lacedaemonian, 
<A NAME="401"></A>was sent out in a galley from Lacedaemon to Mitylene. Going by sea to Pyrrha, 
<A NAME="402"></A>and from thence overland, he passed along the bed of a torrent, where the 
<A NAME="403"></A>line of circumvallation was passable, and thus entering unperceived into 
<A NAME="404"></A>Mitylene told the magistrates that Attica would certainly be invaded, and 
<A NAME="405"></A>the forty ships destined to relieve them arrive, and that he had been sent 
<A NAME="406"></A>on to announce this and to superintend matters generally. The Mitylenians 
<A NAME="407"></A>upon this took courage, and laid aside the idea of treating with the Athenians; 
<A NAME="408"></A>and now this winter ended, and with it ended the fourth year of the war 
<A NAME="409"></A>of which Thucydides was the historian.
<A NAME="410"></A><BR><BR>The next summer the Peloponnesians sent off the forty-two ships 
<A NAME="411"></A>for Mitylene, under Alcidas, their high admiral, and themselves and their 
<A NAME="412"></A>allies invaded Attica, their object being to distract the Athenians by 
<A NAME="413"></A>a double movement, and thus to make it less easy for them to act against 
<A NAME="414"></A>the fleet sailing to Mitylene. The commander in this invasion was Cleomenes, 
<A NAME="415"></A>in the place of King Pausanias, son of Pleistoanax, his nephew, who was 
<A NAME="416"></A>still a minor. Not content with laying waste whatever had shot up in the 
<A NAME="417"></A>parts which they had before devastated, the invaders now extended their 
<A NAME="418"></A>ravages to lands passed over in their previous incursions; so that this 
<A NAME="419"></A>invasion was more severely felt by the Athenians than any except the second; 
<A NAME="420"></A>the enemy staying on and on until they had overrun most of the country, 
<A NAME="421"></A>in the expectation of hearing from Lesbos of something having been achieved 
<A NAME="422"></A>by their fleet, which they thought must now have got over. However, as 
<A NAME="423"></A>they did not obtain any of the results expected, and their provisions began 
<A NAME="424"></A>to run short, they retreated and dispersed to their different 
<A NAME="425"></A>cities.
<A NAME="426"></A><BR><BR>In the meantime the Mitylenians, finding their provisions failing, 
<A NAME="427"></A>while the fleet from Peloponnese was loitering on the way instead of appearing 
<A NAME="428"></A>at Mitylene, were compelled to come to terms with the Athenians in the 
<A NAME="429"></A>following manner. Salaethus having himself ceased to expect the fleet to 
<A NAME="430"></A>arrive, now armed the commons with heavy armour, which they had not before 
<A NAME="431"></A>possessed, with the intention of making a sortie against the Athenians. 
<A NAME="432"></A>The commons, however, no sooner found themselves possessed of arms than 
<A NAME="433"></A>they refused any longer to obey their officers; and forming in knots together, 
<A NAME="434"></A>told the authorities to bring out in public the provisions and divide them 
<A NAME="435"></A>amongst them all, or they would themselves come to terms with the Athenians 
<A NAME="436"></A>and deliver up the city.
<A NAME="437"></A><BR><BR>The government, aware of their inability to prevent this, and of 
<A NAME="438"></A>the danger they would be in, if left out of the capitulation, publicly 
<A NAME="439"></A>agreed with Paches and the army to surrender Mitylene at discretion and 
<A NAME="440"></A>to admit the troops into the town; upon the understanding that the Mitylenians 
<A NAME="441"></A>should be allowed to send an embassy to Athens to plead their cause, and 
<A NAME="442"></A>that Paches should not imprison, make slaves of, or put to death any of 
<A NAME="443"></A>the citizens until its return. Such were the terms of the capitulation; 
<A NAME="444"></A>in spite of which the chief authors of the negotiation with Lacedaemon 
<A NAME="445"></A>were so completely overcome by terror when the army entered that they went 
<A NAME="446"></A>and seated themselves by the altars, from which they were raised up by 
<A NAME="447"></A>Paches under promise that he would do them no wrong, and lodged by him 
<A NAME="448"></A>in Tenedos, until he should learn the pleasure of the Athenians concerning 
<A NAME="449"></A>them. Paches also sent some galleys and seized Antissa, and took such other 
<A NAME="450"></A>military measures as he thought advisable.
<A NAME="451"></A><BR><BR>Meanwhile the Peloponnesians in the forty ships, who ought to have 
<A NAME="452"></A>made all haste to relieve Mitylene, lost time in coming round Peloponnese 
<A NAME="453"></A>itself, and proceeding leisurely on the remainder of the voyage, made Delos 
<A NAME="454"></A>without having been seen by the Athenians at Athens, and from thence arriving 
<A NAME="455"></A>at Icarus and Myconus, there first heard of the fall of Mitylene. Wishing 
<A NAME="456"></A>to know the truth, they put into Embatum, in the Erythraeid, about seven 
<A NAME="457"></A>days after the capture of the town. Here they learned the truth, and began 
<A NAME="458"></A>to consider what they were to do; and Teutiaplus, an Elean, addressed them 
<A NAME="459"></A>as follows:
<A NAME="460"></A><BR><BR>"Alcidas and Peloponnesians who share with me the command of this 
<A NAME="461"></A>armament, my advice is to sail just as we are to Mitylene, before we have 
<A NAME="462"></A>been heard of. We may expect to find the Athenians as much off their guard 
<A NAME="463"></A>as men generally are who have just taken a city: this will certainly be 
<A NAME="464"></A>so by sea, where they have no idea of any enemy attacking them, and where 
<A NAME="465"></A>our strength, as it happens, mainly lies; while even their land forces 
<A NAME="466"></A>are probably scattered about the houses in the carelessness of victory. 
<A NAME="467"></A>If therefore we were to fall upon them suddenly and in the night, I have 
<A NAME="468"></A>hopes, with the help of the well-wishers that we may have left inside the 
<A NAME="469"></A>town, that we shall become masters of the place. Let us not shrink from 
<A NAME="470"></A>the risk, but let us remember that this is just the occasion for one of 
<A NAME="471"></A>the baseless panics common in war: and that to be able to guard against 
<A NAME="472"></A>these in one's own case, and to detect the moment when an attack will find 
<A NAME="473"></A>an enemy at this disadvantage, is what makes a successful 
<A NAME="474"></A>general."
<A NAME="475"></A><BR><BR>These words of Teutiaplus failing to move Alcidas, some of the 
<A NAME="476"></A>Ionian exiles and the Lesbians with the expedition began to urge him, since 
<A NAME="477"></A>this seemed too dangerous, to seize one of the Ionian cities or the Aeolic 
<A NAME="478"></A>town of Cyme, to use as a base for effecting the revolt of Ionia. This 
<A NAME="479"></A>was by no means a hopeless enterprise, as their coming was welcome everywhere; 
<A NAME="480"></A>their object would be by this move to deprive Athens of her chief source 
<A NAME="481"></A>of revenue, and at the same time to saddle her with expense, if she chose 
<A NAME="482"></A>to blockade them; and they would probably induce Pissuthnes to join them 
<A NAME="483"></A>in the war. However, Alcidas gave this proposal as bad a reception as the 
<A NAME="484"></A>other, being eager, since he had come too late for Mitylene, to find himself 
<A NAME="485"></A>back in Peloponnese as soon as possible.
<A NAME="486"></A><BR><BR>Accordingly he put out from Embatum and proceeded along shore; 
<A NAME="487"></A>and touching at the Teian town, Myonnesus, there butchered most of the 
<A NAME="488"></A>prisoners that he had taken on his passage. Upon his coming to anchor at 
<A NAME="489"></A>Ephesus, envoys came to him from the Samians at Anaia, and told him that 
<A NAME="490"></A>he was not going the right way to free Hellas in massacring men who had 
<A NAME="491"></A>never raised a hand against him, and who were not enemies of his, but allies 
<A NAME="492"></A>of Athens against their will, and that if he did not stop he would turn 
<A NAME="493"></A>many more friends into enemies than enemies into friends. Alcidas agreed 
<A NAME="494"></A>to this, and let go all the Chians still in his hands and some of the others 
<A NAME="495"></A>that he had taken; the inhabitants, instead of flying at the sight of his 
<A NAME="496"></A>vessels, rather coming up to them, taking them for Athenian, having no 
<A NAME="497"></A>sort of expectation that while the Athenians commanded the sea Peloponnesian 
<A NAME="498"></A>ships would venture over to Ionia.
<A NAME="499"></A><BR><BR>From Ephesus Alcidas set sail in haste and fled. He had been seen 
<A NAME="500"></A>by the Salaminian and Paralian galleys, which happened to be sailing from 
<A NAME="501"></A>Athens, while still at anchor off Clarus; and fearing pursuit he now made 
<A NAME="502"></A>across the open sea, fully determined to touch nowhere, if he could help 
<A NAME="503"></A>it, until he got to Peloponnese. Meanwhile news of him had come in to Paches 
<A NAME="504"></A>from the Erythraeid, and indeed from all quarters. As Ionia was unfortified, 
<A NAME="505"></A>great fears were felt that the Peloponnesians coasting along shore, even 
<A NAME="506"></A>if they did not intend to stay, might make descents in passing and plunder 
<A NAME="507"></A>the towns; and now the Paralian and Salaminian, having seen him at Clarus, 
<A NAME="508"></A>themselves brought intelligence of the fact. Paches accordingly gave hot 
<A NAME="509"></A>chase, and continued the pursuit as far as the isle of Patmos, and then 
<A NAME="510"></A>finding that Alcidas had got on too far to be overtaken, came back again. 
<A NAME="511"></A>Meanwhile he thought it fortunate that, as he had not fallen in with them 
<A NAME="512"></A>out at sea, he had not overtaken them anywhere where they would have been 
<A NAME="513"></A>forced to encamp, and so give him the trouble of blockading 
<A NAME="514"></A>them.
<A NAME="515"></A><BR><BR>On his return along shore he touched, among other places, at Notium, 
<A NAME="516"></A>the port of Colophon, where the Colophonians had settled after the capture 
<A NAME="517"></A>of the upper town by Itamenes and the barbarians, who had been called in 
<A NAME="518"></A>by certain individuals in a party quarrel. The capture of the town took 
<A NAME="519"></A>place about the time of the second Peloponnesian invasion of Attica. However, 
<A NAME="520"></A>the refugees, after settling at Notium, again split up into factions, one 
<A NAME="521"></A>of which called in Arcadian and barbarian mercenaries from Pissuthnes and, 
<A NAME="522"></A>entrenching these in a quarter apart, formed a new community with the Median 
<A NAME="523"></A>party of the Colophonians who joined them from the upper town. Their opponents 
<A NAME="524"></A>had retired into exile, and now called in Paches, who invited Hippias, 
<A NAME="525"></A>the commander of the Arcadians in the fortified quarter, to a parley, upon 
<A NAME="526"></A>condition that, if they could not agree, he was to be put back safe and 
<A NAME="527"></A>sound in the fortification. However, upon his coming out to him, he put 
<A NAME="528"></A>him into custody, though not in chains, and attacked suddenly and took 
<A NAME="529"></A>by surprise the fortification, and putting the Arcadians and the barbarians 
<A NAME="530"></A>found in it to the sword, afterwards took Hippias into it as he had promised, 
<A NAME="531"></A>and, as soon as he was inside, seized him and shot him down. Paches then 
<A NAME="532"></A>gave up Notium to the Colophonians not of the Median party; and settlers 
<A NAME="533"></A>were afterwards sent out from Athens, and the place colonized according 
<A NAME="534"></A>to Athenian laws, after collecting all the Colophonians found in any of 
<A NAME="535"></A>the cities.
<A NAME="536"></A><BR><BR>Arrived at Mitylene, Paches reduced Pyrrha and Eresus; and finding 
<A NAME="537"></A>the Lacedaemonian, Salaethus, in hiding in the town, sent him off to Athens, 
<A NAME="538"></A>together with the Mitylenians that he had placed in Tenedos, and any other 
<A NAME="539"></A>persons that he thought concerned in the revolt. He also sent back the 
<A NAME="540"></A>greater part of his forces, remaining with the rest to settle Mitylene 
<A NAME="541"></A>and the rest of Lesbos as he thought best.
<A NAME="542"></A><BR><BR>Upon the arrival of the prisoners with Salaethus, the Athenians 
<A NAME="543"></A>at once put the latter to death, although he offered, among other things, 
<A NAME="544"></A>to procure the withdrawal of the Peloponnesians from Plataea, which was 
<A NAME="545"></A>still under siege; and after deliberating as to what they should do with 
<A NAME="546"></A>the former, in the fury of the moment determined to put to death not only 
<A NAME="547"></A>the prisoners at Athens, but the whole adult male population of Mitylene, 
<A NAME="548"></A>and to make slaves of the women and children. It was remarked that Mitylene 
<A NAME="549"></A>had revolted without being, like the rest, subjected to the empire; and 
<A NAME="550"></A>what above all swelled the wrath of the Athenians was the fact of the Peloponnesian 
<A NAME="551"></A>fleet having ventured over to Ionia to her support, a fact which was held 
<A NAME="552"></A>to argue a long meditated rebellion. They accordingly sent a galley to 
<A NAME="553"></A>communicate the decree to Paches, commanding him to lose no time in dispatching 
<A NAME="554"></A>the Mitylenians. The morrow brought repentance with it and reflection on 
<A NAME="555"></A>the horrid cruelty of a decree, which condemned a whole city to the fate 
<A NAME="556"></A>merited only by the guilty. This was no sooner perceived by the Mitylenian 
<A NAME="557"></A>ambassadors at Athens and their Athenian supporters, than they moved the 
<A NAME="558"></A>authorities to put the question again to the vote; which they the more 
<A NAME="559"></A>easily consented to do, as they themselves plainly saw that most of the 
<A NAME="560"></A>citizens wished some one to give them an opportunity for reconsidering 
<A NAME="561"></A>the matter. An assembly was therefore at once called, and after much expression 
<A NAME="562"></A>of opinion upon both sides, Cleon, son of Cleaenetus, the same who had 
<A NAME="563"></A>carried the former motion of putting the Mitylenians to death, the most 
<A NAME="564"></A>violent man at Athens, and at that time by far the most powerful with the 
<A NAME="565"></A>commons, came forward again and spoke as follows:
<A NAME="566"></A><BR><BR>"I have often before now been convinced that a democracy is incapable 
<A NAME="567"></A>of empire, and never more so than by your present change of mind in the 
<A NAME="568"></A>matter of Mitylene. Fears or plots being unknown to you in your daily relations 
<A NAME="569"></A>with each other, you feel just the same with regard to your allies, and 
<A NAME="570"></A>never reflect that the mistakes into which you may be led by listening 
<A NAME="571"></A>to their appeals, or by giving way to your own compassion, are full of 
<A NAME="572"></A>danger to yourselves, and bring you no thanks for your weakness from your 
<A NAME="573"></A>allies; entirely forgetting that your empire is a despotism and your subjects 
<A NAME="574"></A>disaffected conspirators, whose obedience is ensured not by your suicidal 
<A NAME="575"></A>concessions, but by the superiority given you by your own strength and 
<A NAME="576"></A>not their loyalty. The most alarming feature in the case is the constant 
<A NAME="577"></A>change of measures with which we appear to be threatened, and our seeming 
<A NAME="578"></A>ignorance of the fact that bad laws which are never changed are better 
<A NAME="579"></A>for a city than good ones that have no authority; that unlearned loyalty 
<A NAME="580"></A>is more serviceable than quick-witted insubordination; and that ordinary 
<A NAME="581"></A>men usually manage public affairs better than their more gifted fellows. 
<A NAME="582"></A>The latter are always wanting to appear wiser than the laws, and to overrule 
<A NAME="583"></A>every proposition brought forward, thinking that they cannot show their 
<A NAME="584"></A>wit in more important matters, and by such behaviour too often ruin their 
<A NAME="585"></A>country; while those who mistrust their own cleverness are content to be 
<A NAME="586"></A>less learned than the laws, and less able to pick holes in the speech of 
<A NAME="587"></A>a good speaker; and being fair judges rather than rival athletes, generally 
<A NAME="588"></A>conduct affairs successfully. These we ought to imitate, instead of being 
<A NAME="589"></A>led on by cleverness and intellectual rivalry to advise your people against 
<A NAME="590"></A>our real opinions.
<A NAME="591"></A><BR><BR>"For myself, I adhere to my former opinion, and wonder at those 
<A NAME="592"></A>who have proposed to reopen the case of the Mitylenians, and who are thus 
<A NAME="593"></A>causing a delay which is all in favour of the guilty, by making the sufferer 
<A NAME="594"></A>proceed against the offender with the edge of his anger blunted; although 
<A NAME="595"></A>where vengeance follows most closely upon the wrong, it best equals it 
<A NAME="596"></A>and most amply requites it. I wonder also who will be the man who will 
<A NAME="597"></A>maintain the contrary, and will pretend to show that the crimes of the 
<A NAME="598"></A>Mitylenians are of service to us, and our misfortunes injurious to the 
<A NAME="599"></A>allies. Such a man must plainly either have such confidence in his rhetoric 
<A NAME="600"></A>as to adventure to prove that what has been once for all decided is still 
<A NAME="601"></A>undetermined, or be bribed to try to delude us by elaborate sophisms. In 
<A NAME="602"></A>such contests the state gives the rewards to others, and takes the dangers 
<A NAME="603"></A>for herself. The persons to blame are you who are so foolish as to institute 
<A NAME="604"></A>these contests; who go to see an oration as you would to see a sight, take 
<A NAME="605"></A>your facts on hearsay, judge of the practicability of a project by the 
<A NAME="606"></A>wit of its advocates, and trust for the truth as to past events not to 
<A NAME="607"></A>the fact which you saw more than to the clever strictures which you heard; 
<A NAME="608"></A>the easy victims of new-fangled arguments, unwilling to follow received 
<A NAME="609"></A>conclusions; slaves to every new paradox, despisers of the commonplace; 
<A NAME="610"></A>the first wish of every man being that he could speak himself, the next 
<A NAME="611"></A>to rival those who can speak by seeming to be quite up with their ideas 
<A NAME="612"></A>by applauding every hit almost before it is made, and by being as quick 
<A NAME="613"></A>in catching an argument as you are slow in foreseeing its consequences; 
<A NAME="614"></A>asking, if I may so say, for something different from the conditions under 
<A NAME="615"></A>which we live, and yet comprehending inadequately those very conditions; 
<A NAME="616"></A>very slaves to the pleasure of the ear, and more like the audience of a 
<A NAME="617"></A>rhetorician than the council of a city.
<A NAME="618"></A><BR><BR>"In order to keep you from this, I proceed to show that no one 
<A NAME="619"></A>state has ever injured you as much as Mitylene. I can make allowance for 
<A NAME="620"></A>those who revolt because they cannot bear our empire, or who have been 
<A NAME="621"></A>forced to do so by the enemy. But for those who possessed an island with 
<A NAME="622"></A>fortifications; who could fear our enemies only by sea, and there had their 
<A NAME="623"></A>own force of galleys to protect them; who were independent and held in 
<A NAME="624"></A>the highest honour by you- to act as these have done, this is not revolt- 
<A NAME="625"></A>revolt implies oppression; it is deliberate and wanton aggression; an attempt 
<A NAME="626"></A>to ruin us by siding with our bitterest enemies; a worse offence than a 
<A NAME="627"></A>war undertaken on their own account in the acquisition of power. The fate 
<A NAME="628"></A>of those of their neighbours who had already rebelled and had been subdued 
<A NAME="629"></A>was no lesson to them; their own prosperity could not dissuade them from 
<A NAME="630"></A>affronting danger; but blindly confident in the future, and full of hopes 
<A NAME="631"></A>beyond their power though not beyond their ambition, they declared war 
<A NAME="632"></A>and made their decision to prefer might to right, their attack being determined 
<A NAME="633"></A>not by provocation but by the moment which seemed propitious. The truth 
<A NAME="634"></A>is that great good fortune coming suddenly and unexpectedly tends to make 
<A NAME="635"></A>a people insolent; in most cases it is safer for mankind to have success 
<A NAME="636"></A>in reason than out of reason; and it is easier for them, one may say, to 
<A NAME="637"></A>stave off adversity than to preserve prosperity. Our mistake has been to 
<A NAME="638"></A>distinguish the Mitylenians as we have done: had they been long ago treated 
<A NAME="639"></A>like the rest, they never would have so far forgotten themselves, human 
<A NAME="640"></A>nature being as surely made arrogant by consideration as it is awed by 
<A NAME="641"></A>firmness. Let them now therefore be punished as their crime requires, and 
<A NAME="642"></A>do not, while you condemn the aristocracy, absolve the people. This is 
<A NAME="643"></A>certain, that all attacked you without distinction, although they might 
<A NAME="644"></A>have come over to us and been now again in possession of their city. But 
<A NAME="645"></A>no, they thought it safer to throw in their lot with the aristocracy and 
<A NAME="646"></A>so joined their rebellion! Consider therefore: if you subject to the same 
<A NAME="647"></A>punishment the ally who is forced to rebel by the enemy, and him who does 
<A NAME="648"></A>so by his own free choice, which of them, think you, is there that will 
<A NAME="649"></A>not rebel upon the slightest pretext; when the reward of success is freedom, 
<A NAME="650"></A>and the penalty of failure nothing so very terrible? We meanwhile shall 
<A NAME="651"></A>have to risk our money and our lives against one state after another; and 
<A NAME="652"></A>if successful, shall receive a ruined town from which we can no longer 
<A NAME="653"></A>draw the revenue upon which our strength depends; while if unsuccessful, 
<A NAME="654"></A>we shall have an enemy the more upon our hands, and shall spend the time 
<A NAME="655"></A>that might be employed in combating our existing foes in warring with our 
<A NAME="656"></A>own allies.
<A NAME="657"></A><BR><BR>"No hope, therefore, that rhetoric may instil or money purchase, 
<A NAME="658"></A>of the mercy due to human infirmity must be held out to the Mitylenians. 
<A NAME="659"></A>Their offence was not involuntary, but of malice and deliberate; and mercy 
<A NAME="660"></A>is only for unwilling offenders. I therefore, now as before, persist against 
<A NAME="661"></A>your reversing your first decision, or giving way to the three failings 
<A NAME="662"></A>most fatal to empire- pity, sentiment, and indulgence. Compassion is due 
<A NAME="663"></A>to those who can reciprocate the feeling, not to those who will never pity 
<A NAME="664"></A>us in return, but are our natural and necessary foes: the orators who charm 
<A NAME="665"></A>us with sentiment may find other less important arenas for their talents, 
<A NAME="666"></A>in the place of one where the city pays a heavy penalty for a momentary 
<A NAME="667"></A>pleasure, themselves receiving fine acknowledgments for their fine phrases; 
<A NAME="668"></A>while indulgence should be shown towards those who will be our friends 
<A NAME="669"></A>in future, instead of towards men who will remain just what they were, 
<A NAME="670"></A>and as much our enemies as before. To sum up shortly, I say that if you 
<A NAME="671"></A>follow my advice you will do what is just towards the Mitylenians, and 
<A NAME="672"></A>at the same time expedient; while by a different decision you will not 
<A NAME="673"></A>oblige them so much as pass sentence upon yourselves. For if they were 
<A NAME="674"></A>right in rebelling, you must be wrong in ruling. However, if, right or 
<A NAME="675"></A>wrong, you determine to rule, you must carry out your principle and punish 
<A NAME="676"></A>the Mitylenians as your interest requires; or else you must give up your 
<A NAME="677"></A>empire and cultivate honesty without danger. Make up your minds, therefore, 
<A NAME="678"></A>to give them like for like; and do not let the victims who escaped the 
<A NAME="679"></A>plot be more insensible than the conspirators who hatched it; but reflect 
<A NAME="680"></A>what they would have done if victorious over you, especially they were 
<A NAME="681"></A>the aggressors. It is they who wrong their neighbour without a cause, that 
<A NAME="682"></A>pursue their victim to the death, on account of the danger which they foresee 
<A NAME="683"></A>in letting their enemy survive; since the object of a wanton wrong is more 
<A NAME="684"></A>dangerous, if he escape, than an enemy who has not this to complain of. 
<A NAME="685"></A>Do not, therefore, be traitors to yourselves, but recall as nearly as possible 
<A NAME="686"></A>the moment of suffering and the supreme importance which you then attached 
<A NAME="687"></A>to their reduction; and now pay them back in their turn, without yielding 
<A NAME="688"></A>to present weakness or forgetting the peril that once hung over you. Punish 
<A NAME="689"></A>them as they deserve, and teach your other allies by a striking example 
<A NAME="690"></A>that the penalty of rebellion is death. Let them once understand this and 
<A NAME="691"></A>you will not have so often to neglect your enemies while you are fighting 
<A NAME="692"></A>with your own confederates."
<A NAME="693"></A><BR><BR>Such were the words of Cleon. After him Diodotus, son of Eucrates, 
<A NAME="694"></A>who had also in the previous assembly spoken most strongly against putting 
<A NAME="695"></A>the Mitylenians to death, came forward and spoke as 
<A NAME="696"></A>follows:
<A NAME="697"></A><BR><BR>"I do not blame the persons who have reopened the case of the Mitylenians, 
<A NAME="698"></A>nor do I approve the protests which we have heard against important questions 
<A NAME="699"></A>being frequently debated. I think the two things most opposed to good counsel 
<A NAME="700"></A>are haste and passion; haste usually goes hand in hand with folly, passion 
<A NAME="701"></A>with coarseness and narrowness of mind. As for the argument that speech 
<A NAME="702"></A>ought not to be the exponent of action, the man who uses it must be either 
<A NAME="703"></A>senseless or interested: senseless if he believes it possible to treat 
<A NAME="704"></A>of the uncertain future through any other medium; interested if, wishing 
<A NAME="705"></A>to carry a disgraceful measure and doubting his ability to speak well in 
<A NAME="706"></A>a bad cause, he thinks to frighten opponents and hearers by well-aimed 
<A NAME="707"></A>calumny. What is still more intolerable is to accuse a speaker of making 
<A NAME="708"></A>a display in order to be paid for it. If ignorance only were imputed, an 
<A NAME="709"></A>unsuccessful speaker might retire with a reputation for honesty, if not 
<A NAME="710"></A>for wisdom; while the charge of dishonesty makes him suspected, if successful, 
<A NAME="711"></A>and thought, if defeated, not only a fool but a rogue. The city is no gainer 
<A NAME="712"></A>by such a system, since fear deprives it of its advisers; although in truth, 
<A NAME="713"></A>if our speakers are to make such assertions, it would be better for the 
<A NAME="714"></A>country if they could not speak at all, as we should then make fewer blunders. 
<A NAME="715"></A>The good citizen ought to triumph not by frightening his opponents but 
<A NAME="716"></A>by beating them fairly in argument; and a wise city, without over-distinguishing 
<A NAME="717"></A>its best advisers, will nevertheless not deprive them of their due, and, 
<A NAME="718"></A>far from punishing an unlucky counsellor, will not even regard him as disgraced. 
<A NAME="719"></A>In this way successful orators would be least tempted to sacrifice their 
<A NAME="720"></A>convictions to popularity, in the hope of still higher honours, and unsuccessful 
<A NAME="721"></A>speakers to resort to the same popular arts in order to win over the 
<A NAME="722"></A>multitude.
<A NAME="723"></A><BR><BR>"This is not our way; and, besides, the moment that a man is suspected 
<A NAME="724"></A>of giving advice, however good, from corrupt motives, we feel such a grudge 
<A NAME="725"></A>against him for the gain which after all we are not certain he will receive, 
<A NAME="726"></A>that we deprive the city of its certain benefit. Plain good advice has 
<A NAME="727"></A>thus come to be no less suspected than bad; and the advocate of the most 
<A NAME="728"></A>monstrous measures is not more obliged to use deceit to gain the people, 
<A NAME="729"></A>than the best counsellor is to lie in order to be believed. The city and 
<A NAME="730"></A>the city only, owing to these refinements, can never be served openly and 
<A NAME="731"></A>without disguise; he who does serve it openly being always suspected of 
<A NAME="732"></A>serving himself in some secret way in return. Still, considering the magnitude 
<A NAME="733"></A>of the interests involved, and the position of affairs, we orators must 
<A NAME="734"></A>make it our business to look a little farther than you who judge offhand; 
<A NAME="735"></A>especially as we, your advisers, are responsible, while you, our audience, 
<A NAME="736"></A>are not so. For if those who gave the advice, and those who took it, suffered 
<A NAME="737"></A>equally, you would judge more calmly; as it is, you visit the disasters 
<A NAME="738"></A>into which the whim of the moment may have led you upon the single person 
<A NAME="739"></A>of your adviser, not upon yourselves, his numerous companions in 
<A NAME="740"></A>error.
<A NAME="741"></A><BR><BR>"However, I have not come forward either to oppose or to accuse 
<A NAME="742"></A>in the matter of Mitylene; indeed, the question before us as sensible men 
<A NAME="743"></A>is not their guilt, but our interests. Though I prove them ever so guilty, 
<A NAME="744"></A>I shall not, therefore, advise their death, unless it be expedient; nor 
<A NAME="745"></A>though they should have claims to indulgence, shall I recommend it, unless 
<A NAME="746"></A>it be dearly for the good of the country. I consider that we are deliberating 
<A NAME="747"></A>for the future more than for the present; and where Cleon is so positive 
<A NAME="748"></A>as to the useful deterrent effects that will follow from making rebellion 
<A NAME="749"></A>capital, I, who consider the interests of the future quite as much as he, 
<A NAME="750"></A>as positively maintain the contrary. And I require you not to reject my 
<A NAME="751"></A>useful considerations for his specious ones: his speech may have the attraction 
<A NAME="752"></A>of seeming the more just in your present temper against Mitylene; but we 
<A NAME="753"></A>are not in a court of justice, but in a political assembly; and the question 
<A NAME="754"></A>is not justice, but how to make the Mitylenians useful to 
<A NAME="755"></A>Athens.
<A NAME="756"></A><BR><BR>"Now of course communities have enacted the penalty of death for 
<A NAME="757"></A>many offences far lighter than this: still hope leads men to venture, and 
<A NAME="758"></A>no one ever yet put himself in peril without the inward conviction that 
<A NAME="759"></A>he would succeed in his design. Again, was there ever city rebelling that 
<A NAME="760"></A>did not believe that it possessed either in itself or in its alliances 
<A NAME="761"></A>resources adequate to the enterprise? All, states and individuals, are 
<A NAME="762"></A>alike prone to err, and there is no law that will prevent them; or why 
<A NAME="763"></A>should men have exhausted the list of punishments in search of enactments 
<A NAME="764"></A>to protect them from evildoers? It is probable that in early times the 
<A NAME="765"></A>penalties for the greatest offences were less severe, and that, as these 
<A NAME="766"></A>were disregarded, the penalty of death has been by degrees in most cases 
<A NAME="767"></A>arrived at, which is itself disregarded in like manner. Either then some 
<A NAME="768"></A>means of terror more terrible than this must be discovered, or it must 
<A NAME="769"></A>be owned that this restraint is useless; and that as long as poverty gives 
<A NAME="770"></A>men the courage of necessity, or plenty fills them with the ambition which 
<A NAME="771"></A>belongs to insolence and pride, and the other conditions of life remain 
<A NAME="772"></A>each under the thraldom of some fatal and master passion, so long will 
<A NAME="773"></A>the impulse never be wanting to drive men into danger. Hope also and cupidity, 
<A NAME="774"></A>the one leading and the other following, the one conceiving the attempt, 
<A NAME="775"></A>the other suggesting the facility of succeeding, cause the widest ruin, 
<A NAME="776"></A>and, although invisible agents, are far stronger than the dangers that 
<A NAME="777"></A>are seen. Fortune, too, powerfully helps the delusion and, by the unexpected 
<A NAME="778"></A>aid that she sometimes lends, tempts men to venture with inferior means; 
<A NAME="779"></A>and this is especially the case with communities, because the stakes played 
<A NAME="780"></A>for are the highest, freedom or empire, and, when all are acting together, 
<A NAME="781"></A>each man irrationally magnifies his own capacity. In fine, it is impossible 
<A NAME="782"></A>to prevent, and only great simplicity can hope to prevent, human nature 
<A NAME="783"></A>doing what it has once set its mind upon, by force of law or by any other 
<A NAME="784"></A>deterrent force whatsoever.
<A NAME="785"></A><BR><BR>"We must not, therefore, commit ourselves to a false policy through 
<A NAME="786"></A>a belief in the efficacy of the punishment of death, or exclude rebels 
<A NAME="787"></A>from the hope of repentance and an early atonement of their error. Consider 
<A NAME="788"></A>a moment. At present, if a city that has already revolted perceive that 
<A NAME="789"></A>it cannot succeed, it will come to terms while it is still able to refund 
<A NAME="790"></A>expenses, and pay tribute afterwards. In the other case, what city, think 
<A NAME="791"></A>you, would not prepare better than is now done, and hold out to the last 
<A NAME="792"></A>against its besiegers, if it is all one whether it surrender late or soon? 
<A NAME="793"></A>And how can it be otherwise than hurtful to us to be put to the expense 
<A NAME="794"></A>of a siege, because surrender is out of the question; and if we take the 
<A NAME="795"></A>city, to receive a ruined town from which we can no longer draw the revenue 
<A NAME="796"></A>which forms our real strength against the enemy? We must not, therefore, 
<A NAME="797"></A>sit as strict judges of the offenders to our own prejudice, but rather 
<A NAME="798"></A>see how by moderate chastisements we may be enabled to benefit in future 
<A NAME="799"></A>by the revenue-producing powers of our dependencies; and we must make up 
<A NAME="800"></A>our minds to look for our protection not to legal terrors but to careful 
<A NAME="801"></A>administration. At present we do exactly the opposite. When a free community, 
<A NAME="802"></A>held in subjection by force, rises, as is only natural, and asserts its 
<A NAME="803"></A>independence, it is no sooner reduced than we fancy ourselves obliged to 
<A NAME="804"></A>punish it severely; although the right course with freemen is not to chastise 
<A NAME="805"></A>them rigorously when they do rise, but rigorously to watch them before 
<A NAME="806"></A>they rise, and to prevent their ever entertaining the idea, and, the insurrection 
<A NAME="807"></A>suppressed, to make as few responsible for it as possible.
<A NAME="808"></A><BR><BR>"Only consider what a blunder you would commit in doing as Cleon 
<A NAME="809"></A>recommends. As things are at present, in all the cities the people is your 
<A NAME="810"></A>friend, and either does not revolt with the oligarchy, or, if forced to 
<A NAME="811"></A>do so, becomes at once the enemy of the insurgents; so that in the war 
<A NAME="812"></A>with the hostile city you have the masses on your side. But if you butcher 
<A NAME="813"></A>the people of Mitylene, who had nothing to do with the revolt, and who, 
<A NAME="814"></A>as soon as they got arms, of their own motion surrendered the town, first 
<A NAME="815"></A>you will commit the crime of killing your benefactors; and next you will 
<A NAME="816"></A>play directly into the hands of the higher classes, who when they induce 
<A NAME="817"></A>their cities to rise, will immediately have the people on their side, through 
<A NAME="818"></A>your having announced in advance the same punishment for those who are 
<A NAME="819"></A>guilty and for those who are not. On the contrary, even if they were guilty, 
<A NAME="820"></A>you ought to seem not to notice it, in order to avoid alienating the only 
<A NAME="821"></A>class still friendly to us. In short, I consider it far more useful for 
<A NAME="822"></A>the preservation of our empire voluntarily to put up with injustice, than 
<A NAME="823"></A>to put to death, however justly, those whom it is our interest to keep 
<A NAME="824"></A>alive. As for Cleon's idea that in punishment the claims of justice and 
<A NAME="825"></A>expediency can both be satisfied, facts do not confirm the possibility 
<A NAME="826"></A>of such a combination.
<A NAME="827"></A><BR><BR>"Confess, therefore, that this is the wisest course, and without 
<A NAME="828"></A>conceding too much either to pity or to indulgence, by neither of which 
<A NAME="829"></A>motives do I any more than Cleon wish you to be influenced, upon the plain 
<A NAME="830"></A>merits of the case before you, be persuaded by me to try calmly those of 
<A NAME="831"></A>the Mitylenians whom Paches sent off as guilty, and to leave the rest undisturbed. 
<A NAME="832"></A>This is at once best for the future, and most terrible to your enemies 
<A NAME="833"></A>at the present moment; inasmuch as good policy against an adversary is 
<A NAME="834"></A>superior to the blind attacks of brute force."
<A NAME="835"></A><BR><BR>Such were the words of Diodotus. The two opinions thus expressed 
<A NAME="836"></A>were the ones that most directly contradicted each other; and the Athenians, 
<A NAME="837"></A>notwithstanding their change of feeling, now proceeded to a division, in 
<A NAME="838"></A>which the show of hands was almost equal, although the motion of Diodotus 
<A NAME="839"></A>carried the day. Another galley was at once sent off in haste, for fear 
<A NAME="840"></A>that the first might reach Lesbos in the interval, and the city be found 
<A NAME="841"></A>destroyed; the first ship having about a day and a night's start. Wine 
<A NAME="842"></A>and barley-cakes were provided for the vessel by the Mitylenian ambassadors, 
<A NAME="843"></A>and great promises made if they arrived in time; which caused the men to 
<A NAME="844"></A>use such diligence upon the voyage that they took their meals of barley-cakes 
<A NAME="845"></A>kneaded with oil and wine as they rowed, and only slept by turns while 
<A NAME="846"></A>the others were at the oar. Luckily they met with no contrary wind, and 
<A NAME="847"></A>the first ship making no haste upon so horrid an errand, while the second 
<A NAME="848"></A>pressed on in the manner described, the first arrived so little before 
<A NAME="849"></A>them, that Paches had only just had time to read the decree, and to prepare 
<A NAME="850"></A>to execute the sentence, when the second put into port and prevented the 
<A NAME="851"></A>massacre. The danger of Mitylene had indeed been great.
<A NAME="852"></A><BR><BR>The other party whom Paches had sent off as the prime movers in 
<A NAME="853"></A>the rebellion, were upon Cleon's motion put to death by the Athenians, 
<A NAME="854"></A>the number being rather more than a thousand. The Athenians also demolished 
<A NAME="855"></A>the walls of the Mitylenians, and took possession of their ships. Afterwards 
<A NAME="856"></A>tribute was not imposed upon the Lesbians; but all their land, except that 
<A NAME="857"></A>of the Methymnians, was divided into three thousand allotments, three hundred 
<A NAME="858"></A>of which were reserved as sacred for the gods, and the rest assigned by 
<A NAME="859"></A>lot to Athenian shareholders, who were sent out to the island. With these 
<A NAME="860"></A>the Lesbians agreed to pay a rent of two minae a year for each allotment, 
<A NAME="861"></A>and cultivated the land themselves. The Athenians also took possession 
<A NAME="862"></A>of the towns on the continent belonging to the Mitylenians, which thus 
<A NAME="863"></A>became for the future subject to Athens. Such were the events that took 
<A NAME="864"></A>place at Lesbos.

<A NAME="865"></A><B>Chapter X</B>

<A NAME="866"></A><BR><BR><B>Fifth Year of the War - Trial and Execution of</B> <B>the Plataeans 
<A NAME="867"></A>- Corcyraean Revolution</B>
<A NAME="868"></A><BR><BR>During the same summer, after the reduction of Lesbos, the Athenians 
<A NAME="869"></A>under Nicias, son of Niceratus, made an expedition against the island of 
<A NAME="870"></A>Minoa, which lies off Megara and was used as a fortified post by the Megarians, 
<A NAME="871"></A>who had built a tower upon it. Nicias wished to enable the Athenians to 
<A NAME="872"></A>maintain their blockade from this nearer station instead of from Budorum 
<A NAME="873"></A>and Salamis; to stop the Peloponnesian galleys and privateers sailing out 
<A NAME="874"></A>unobserved from the island, as they had been in the habit of doing; and 
<A NAME="875"></A>at the same time prevent anything from coming into Megara. Accordingly, 
<A NAME="876"></A>after taking two towers projecting on the side of Nisaea, by engines from 
<A NAME="877"></A>the sea, and clearing the entrance into the channel between the island 
<A NAME="878"></A>and the shore, he next proceeded to cut off all communication by building 
<A NAME="879"></A>a wall on the mainland at the point where a bridge across a morass enabled 
<A NAME="880"></A>succours to be thrown into the island, which was not far off from the continent. 
<A NAME="881"></A>A few days sufficing to accomplish this, he afterwards raised some works 
<A NAME="882"></A>in the island also, and leaving a garrison there, departed with his 
<A NAME="883"></A>forces.
<A NAME="884"></A><BR><BR>About the same time in this summer, the Plataeans, being now without 
<A NAME="885"></A>provisions and unable to support the siege, surrendered to the Peloponnesians 
<A NAME="886"></A>in the following manner. An assault had been made upon the wall, which 
<A NAME="887"></A>the Plataeans were unable to repel. The Lacedaemonian commander, perceiving 
<A NAME="888"></A>their weakness, wished to avoid taking the place by storm; his instructions 
<A NAME="889"></A>from Lacedaemon having been so conceived, in order that if at any future 
<A NAME="890"></A>time peace should be made with Athens, and they should agree each to restore 
<A NAME="891"></A>the places that they had taken in the war, Plataea might be held to have 
<A NAME="892"></A>come over voluntarily, and not be included in the list. He accordingly 
<A NAME="893"></A>sent a herald to them to ask if they were willing voluntarily to surrender 
<A NAME="894"></A>the town to the Lacedaemonians, and accept them as their judges, upon the 
<A NAME="895"></A>understanding that the guilty should be punished, but no one without form 
<A NAME="896"></A>of law. The Plataeans were now in the last state of weakness, and the herald 
<A NAME="897"></A>had no sooner delivered his message than they surrendered the town. The 
<A NAME="898"></A>Peloponnesians fed them for some days until the judges from Lacedaemon, 
<A NAME="899"></A>who were five in number, arrived. Upon their arrival no charge was preferred; 
<A NAME="900"></A>they simply called up the Plataeans, and asked them whether they had done 
<A NAME="901"></A>the Lacedaemonians and allies any service in the war then raging. The Plataeans 
<A NAME="902"></A>asked leave to speak at greater length, and deputed two of their number 
<A NAME="903"></A>to represent them: Astymachus, son of Asopolaus, and Lacon, son of Aeimnestus, 
<A NAME="904"></A>proxenus of the Lacedaemonians, who came forward and spoke as 
<A NAME="905"></A>follows:
<A NAME="906"></A><BR><BR>"Lacedaemonians, when we surrendered our city we trusted in you, 
<A NAME="907"></A>and looked forward to a trial more agreeable to the forms of law than the 
<A NAME="908"></A>present, to which we had no idea of being subjected; the judges also in 
<A NAME="909"></A>whose hands we consented to place ourselves were you, and you only (from 
<A NAME="910"></A>whom we thought we were most likely to obtain justice), and not other persons, 
<A NAME="911"></A>as is now the case. As matters stand, we are afraid that we have been doubly 
<A NAME="912"></A>deceived. We have good reason to suspect, not only that the issue to be 
<A NAME="913"></A>tried is the most terrible of all, but that you will not prove impartial; 
<A NAME="914"></A>if we may argue from the fact that no accusation was first brought forward 
<A NAME="915"></A>for us to answer, but we had ourselves to ask leave to speak, and from 
<A NAME="916"></A>the question being put so shortly, that a true answer to it tells against 
<A NAME="917"></A>us, while a false one can be contradicted. In this dilemma, our safest, 
<A NAME="918"></A>and indeed our only course, seems to be to say something at all risks: 
<A NAME="919"></A>placed as we are, we could scarcely be silent without being tormented by 
<A NAME="920"></A>the damning thought that speaking might have saved us. Another difficulty 
<A NAME="921"></A>that we have to encounter is the difficulty of convincing you. Were we 
<A NAME="922"></A>unknown to each other we might profit by bringing forward new matter with 
<A NAME="923"></A>which you were unacquainted: as it is, we can tell you nothing that you 
<A NAME="924"></A>do not know already, and we fear, not that you have condemned us in your 
<A NAME="925"></A>own minds of having failed in our duty towards you, and make this our crime, 
<A NAME="926"></A>but that to please a third party we have to submit to a trial the result 
<A NAME="927"></A>of which is already decided. Nevertheless, we will place before you what 
<A NAME="928"></A>we can justly urge, not only on the question of the quarrel which the Thebans 
<A NAME="929"></A>have against us, but also as addressing you and the rest of the Hellenes; 
<A NAME="930"></A>and we will remind you of our good services, and endeavour to prevail with 
<A NAME="931"></A>you.
<A NAME="932"></A><BR><BR>"To your short question, whether we have done the Lacedaemonians 
<A NAME="933"></A>and allies any service in this war, we say, if you ask us as enemies, that 
<A NAME="934"></A>to refrain from serving you was not to do you injury; if as friends, that 
<A NAME="935"></A>you are more in fault for having marched against us. During the peace, 
<A NAME="936"></A>and against the Mede, we acted well: we have not now been the first to 
<A NAME="937"></A>break the peace, and we were the only Boeotians who then joined in defending 
<A NAME="938"></A>against the Mede the liberty of Hellas. Although an inland people, we were 
<A NAME="939"></A>present at the action at Artemisium; in the battle that took place in our 
<A NAME="940"></A>territory we fought by the side of yourselves and Pausanias; and in all 
<A NAME="941"></A>the other Hellenic exploits of the time we took a part quite out of proportion 
<A NAME="942"></A>to our strength. Besides, you, as Lacedaemonians, ought not to forget that 
<A NAME="943"></A>at the time of the great panic at Sparta, after the earthquake, caused 
<A NAME="944"></A>by the secession of the Helots to Ithome, we sent the third part of our 
<A NAME="945"></A>citizens to assist you.
<A NAME="946"></A><BR><BR>"On these great and historical occasions such was the part that 
<A NAME="947"></A>we chose, although afterwards we became your enemies. For this you were 
<A NAME="948"></A>to blame. When we asked for your alliance against our Theban oppressors, 
<A NAME="949"></A>you rejected our petition, and told us to go to the Athenians who were 
<A NAME="950"></A>our neighbours, as you lived too far off. In the war we never have done 
<A NAME="951"></A>to you, and never should have done to you, anything unreasonable. If we 
<A NAME="952"></A>refused to desert the Athenians when you asked us, we did no wrong; they 
<A NAME="953"></A>had helped us against the Thebans when you drew back, and we could no longer 
<A NAME="954"></A>give them up with honour; especially as we had obtained their alliance 
<A NAME="955"></A>and had been admitted to their citizenship at our own request, and after 
<A NAME="956"></A>receiving benefits at their hands; but it was plainly our duty loyally 
<A NAME="957"></A>to obey their orders. Besides, the faults that either of you may commit 
<A NAME="958"></A>in your supremacy must be laid, not upon the followers, but on the chiefs 
<A NAME="959"></A>that lead them astray.
<A NAME="960"></A><BR><BR>"With regard to the Thebans, they have wronged us repeatedly, and 
<A NAME="961"></A>their last aggression, which has been the means of bringing us into our 
<A NAME="962"></A>present position, is within your own knowledge. In seizing our city in 
<A NAME="963"></A>time of peace, and what is more at a holy time in the month, they justly 
<A NAME="964"></A>encountered our vengeance, in accordance with the universal law which sanctions 
<A NAME="965"></A>resistance to an invader; and it cannot now be right that we should suffer 
<A NAME="966"></A>on their account. By taking your own immediate interest and their animosity 
<A NAME="967"></A>as the test of justice, you will prove yourselves to be rather waiters 
<A NAME="968"></A>on expediency than judges of right; although if they seem useful to you 
<A NAME="969"></A>now, we and the rest of the Hellenes gave you much more valuable help at 
<A NAME="970"></A>a time of greater need. Now you are the assailants, and others fear you; 
<A NAME="971"></A>but at the crisis to which we allude, when the barbarian threatened all 
<A NAME="972"></A>with slavery, the Thebans were on his side. It is just, therefore, to put 
<A NAME="973"></A>our patriotism then against our error now, if error there has been; and 
<A NAME="974"></A>you will find the merit outweighing the fault, and displayed at a juncture 
<A NAME="975"></A>when there were few Hellenes who would set their valour against the strength 
<A NAME="976"></A>of Xerxes, and when greater praise was theirs who preferred the dangerous 
<A NAME="977"></A>path of honour to the safe course of consulting their own interest with 
<A NAME="978"></A>respect to the invasion. To these few we belonged, and highly were we honoured 
<A NAME="979"></A>for it; and yet we now fear to perish by having again acted on the same 
<A NAME="980"></A>principles, and chosen to act well with Athens sooner than wisely with 
<A NAME="981"></A>Sparta. Yet in justice the same cases should be decided in the same way, 
<A NAME="982"></A>and policy should not mean anything else than lasting gratitude for the 
<A NAME="983"></A>service of good ally combined with a proper attention to one's own immediate 
<A NAME="984"></A>interest.
<A NAME="985"></A><BR><BR>"Consider also that at present the Hellenes generally regard you 
<A NAME="986"></A>as a pattern of worth and honour; and if you pass an unjust sentence upon 
<A NAME="987"></A>us in this which is no obscure cause, but one in which you, the judges, 
<A NAME="988"></A>are as illustrious as we, the prisoners, are blameless, take care that 
<A NAME="989"></A>displeasure be not felt at an unworthy decision in the matter of honourable 
<A NAME="990"></A>men made by men yet more honourable than they, and at the consecration 
<A NAME="991"></A>in the national temples of spoils taken from the Plataeans, the benefactors 
<A NAME="992"></A>of Hellas. Shocking indeed will it seem for Lacedaemonians to destroy Plataea, 
<A NAME="993"></A>and for the city whose name your fathers inscribed upon the tripod at Delphi 
<A NAME="994"></A>for its good service, to be by you blotted out from the map of Hellas, 
<A NAME="995"></A>to please the Thebans. To such a depth of misfortune have we fallen that, 
<A NAME="996"></A>while the Medes' success had been our ruin, Thebans now supplant us in 
<A NAME="997"></A>your once fond regards; and we have been subjected to two dangers, the 
<A NAME="998"></A>greatest of any- that of dying of starvation then, if we had not surrendered 
<A NAME="999"></A>our town, and now of being tried for our lives. So that we Plataeans, after 
<A NAME="1000"></A>exertions beyond our power in the cause of the Hellenes, are rejected by 
<A NAME="1001"></A>all, forsaken and unassisted; helped by none of our allies, and reduced 
<A NAME="1002"></A>to doubt the stability of our only hope, yourselves.
<A NAME="1003"></A><BR><BR>"Still, in the name of the gods who once presided over our confederacy, 
<A NAME="1004"></A>and of our own good service in the Hellenic cause, we adjure you to relent; 
<A NAME="1005"></A>to recall the decision which we fear that the Thebans may have obtained 
<A NAME="1006"></A>from you; to ask back the gift that you have given them, that they disgrace 
<A NAME="1007"></A>not you by slaying us; to gain a pure instead of a guilty gratitude, and 
<A NAME="1008"></A>not to gratify others to be yourselves rewarded with shame. Our lives may 
<A NAME="1009"></A>be quickly taken, but it will be a heavy task to wipe away the infamy of 
<A NAME="1010"></A>the deed; as we are no enemies whom you might justly punish, but friends 
<A NAME="1011"></A>forced into taking arms against you. To grant us our lives would be, therefore, 
<A NAME="1012"></A>a righteous judgment; if you consider also that we are prisoners who surrendered 
<A NAME="1013"></A>of their own accord, stretching out our hands for quarter, whose slaughter 
<A NAME="1014"></A>Hellenic law forbids, and who besides were always your benefactors. Look 
<A NAME="1015"></A>at the sepulchres of your fathers, slain by the Medes and buried in our 
<A NAME="1016"></A>country, whom year by year we honoured with garments and all other dues, 
<A NAME="1017"></A>and the first-fruits of all that our land produced in their season, as 
<A NAME="1018"></A>friends from a friendly country and allies to our old companions in arms. 
<A NAME="1019"></A>Should you not decide aright, your conduct would be the very opposite to 
<A NAME="1020"></A>ours. Consider only: Pausanias buried them thinking that he was laying 
<A NAME="1021"></A>them in friendly ground and among men as friendly; but you, if you kill 
<A NAME="1022"></A>us and make the Plataean territory Theban, will leave your fathers and 
<A NAME="1023"></A>kinsmen in a hostile soil and among their murderers, deprived of the honours 
<A NAME="1024"></A>which they now enjoy. What is more, you will enslave the land in which 
<A NAME="1025"></A>the freedom of the Hellenes was won, make desolate the temples of the gods 
<A NAME="1026"></A>to whom they prayed before they overcame the Medes, and take away your 
<A NAME="1027"></A>ancestral sacrifices from those who founded and instituted 
<A NAME="1028"></A>them.
<A NAME="1029"></A><BR><BR>"It were not to your glory, Lacedaemonians, either to offend in 
<A NAME="1030"></A>this way against the common law of the Hellenes and against your own ancestors, 
<A NAME="1031"></A>or to kill us your benefactors to gratify another's hatred without having 
<A NAME="1032"></A>been wronged yourselves: it were more so to spare us and to yield to the 
<A NAME="1033"></A>impressions of a reasonable compassion; reflecting not merely on the awful 
<A NAME="1034"></A>fate in store for us, but also on the character of the sufferers, and on 
<A NAME="1035"></A>the impossibility of predicting how soon misfortune may fall even upon 
<A NAME="1036"></A>those who deserve it not. We, as we have a right to do and as our need 
<A NAME="1037"></A>impels us, entreat you, calling aloud upon the gods at whose common altar 
<A NAME="1038"></A>all the Hellenes worship, to hear our request, to be not unmindful of the 
<A NAME="1039"></A>oaths which your fathers swore, and which we now plead- we supplicate you 
<A NAME="1040"></A>by the tombs of your fathers, and appeal to those that are gone to save 
<A NAME="1041"></A>us from falling into the hands of the Thebans and their dearest friends 
<A NAME="1042"></A>from being given up to their most detested foes. We also remind you of 
<A NAME="1043"></A>that day on which we did the most glorious deeds, by your fathers' sides, 
<A NAME="1044"></A>we who now on this are like to suffer the most dreadful fate. Finally, 
<A NAME="1045"></A>to do what is necessary and yet most difficult for men in our situation- 
<A NAME="1046"></A>that is, to make an end of speaking, since with that ending the peril of 
<A NAME="1047"></A>our lives draws near- in conclusion we say that we did not surrender our 
<A NAME="1048"></A>city to the Thebans (to that we would have preferred inglorious starvation), 
<A NAME="1049"></A>but trusted in and capitulated to you; and it would be just, if we fail 
<A NAME="1050"></A>to persuade you, to put us back in the same position and let us take the 
<A NAME="1051"></A>chance that falls to us. And at the same time we adjure you not to give 
<A NAME="1052"></A>us up- your suppliants, Lacedaemonians, out of your hands and faith, Plataeans 
<A NAME="1053"></A>foremost of the Hellenic patriots, to Thebans, our most hated enemies- 
<A NAME="1054"></A>but to be our saviours, and not, while you free the rest of the Hellenes, 
<A NAME="1055"></A>to bring us to destruction."
<A NAME="1056"></A><BR><BR>Such were the words of the Plataeans. The Thebans, afraid that 
<A NAME="1057"></A>the Lacedaemonians might be moved by what they had heard, came forward 
<A NAME="1058"></A>and said that they too desired to address them, since the Plataeans had, 
<A NAME="1059"></A>against their wish, been allowed to speak at length instead of being confined 
<A NAME="1060"></A>to a simple answer to the question. Leave being granted, the Thebans spoke 
<A NAME="1061"></A>as follows:
<A NAME="1062"></A><BR><BR>"We should never have asked to make this speech if the Plataeans 
<A NAME="1063"></A>on their side had contented themselves with shortly answering the question, 
<A NAME="1064"></A>and had not turned round and made charges against us, coupled with a long 
<A NAME="1065"></A>defence of themselves upon matters outside the present inquiry and not 
<A NAME="1066"></A>even the subject of accusation, and with praise of what no one finds fault 
<A NAME="1067"></A>with. However, since they have done so, we must answer their charges and 
<A NAME="1068"></A>refute their self-praise, in order that neither our bad name nor their 
<A NAME="1069"></A>good may help them, but that you may hear the real truth on both points, 
<A NAME="1070"></A>and so decide.
<A NAME="1071"></A><BR><BR>"The origin of our quarrel was this. We settled Plataea some time 
<A NAME="1072"></A>after the rest of Boeotia, together with other places out of which we had 
<A NAME="1073"></A>driven the mixed population. The Plataeans not choosing to recognize our 
<A NAME="1074"></A>supremacy, as had been first arranged, but separating themselves from the 
<A NAME="1075"></A>rest of the Boeotians, and proving traitors to their nationality, we used 
<A NAME="1076"></A>compulsion; upon which they went over to the Athenians, and with them did 
<A NAME="1077"></A>as much harm, for which we retaliated.
<A NAME="1078"></A><BR><BR>"Next, when the barbarian invaded Hellas, they say that they were 
<A NAME="1079"></A>the only Boeotians who did not Medize; and this is where they most glorify 
<A NAME="1080"></A>themselves and
