<A NAME="10"></A><B>Chapter XXI</B>
<A NAME="11"></A><BR><BR><B>Eighteenth and Nineteenth Years of the War -</B> <B>Arrival 
<A NAME="12"></A>of Gylippus at Syracuse - Fortification</B> <B>of Decelea - Successes of 
<A NAME="13"></A>the Syracusans</B>
<A NAME="14"></A><BR><BR>After refitting their ships, Gylippus and Pythen coasted along 
<A NAME="15"></A>from Tarentum to Epizephyrian Locris. They now received the more correct 
<A NAME="16"></A>information that Syracuse was not yet completely invested, but that it 
<A NAME="17"></A>was still possible for an army arriving at Epipolae to effect an entrance; 
<A NAME="18"></A>and they consulted, accordingly, whether they should keep Sicily on their 
<A NAME="19"></A>right and risk sailing in by sea, or, leaving it on their left, should 
<A NAME="20"></A>first sail to Himera and, taking with them the Himeraeans and any others 
<A NAME="21"></A>that might agree to join them, go to Syracuse by land. Finally they determined 
<A NAME="22"></A>to sail for Himera, especially as the four Athenian ships which Nicias 
<A NAME="23"></A>had at length sent off, on hearing that they were at Locris, had not yet 
<A NAME="24"></A>arrived at Rhegium. Accordingly, before these reached their post, the Peloponnesians 
<A NAME="25"></A>crossed the strait and, after touching at Rhegium and Messina, came to 
<A NAME="26"></A>Himera. Arrived there, they persuaded the Himeraeans to join in the war, 
<A NAME="27"></A>and not only to go with them themselves but to provide arms for the seamen 
<A NAME="28"></A>from their vessels which they had drawn ashore at Himera; and they sent 
<A NAME="29"></A>and appointed a place for the Selinuntines to meet them with all their 
<A NAME="30"></A>forces. A few troops were also promised by the Geloans and some of the 
<A NAME="31"></A>Sicels, who were now ready to join them with much greater alacrity, owing 
<A NAME="32"></A>to the recent death of Archonidas, a powerful Sicel king in that neighbourhood 
<A NAME="33"></A>and friendly to Athens, and owing also to the vigour shown by Gylippus 
<A NAME="34"></A>in coming from Lacedaemon. Gylippus now took with him about seven hundred 
<A NAME="35"></A>of his sailors and marines, that number only having arms, a thousand heavy 
<A NAME="36"></A>infantry and light troops from Himera with a body of a hundred horse, some 
<A NAME="37"></A>light troops and cavalry from Selinus, a few Geloans, and Sicels numbering 
<A NAME="38"></A>a thousand in all, and set out on his march for Syracuse.
<A NAME="39"></A><BR><BR>Meanwhile the Corinthian fleet from Leucas made all haste to arrive; 
<A NAME="40"></A>and one of their commanders, Gongylus, starting last with a single ship, 
<A NAME="41"></A>was the first to reach Syracuse, a little before Gylippus. Gongylus found 
<A NAME="42"></A>the Syracusans on the point of holding an assembly to consider whether 
<A NAME="43"></A>they should put an end to the war. This he prevented, and reassured them 
<A NAME="44"></A>by telling them that more vessels were still to arrive, and that Gylippus, 
<A NAME="45"></A>son of Cleandridas, had been dispatched by the Lacedaemonians to take the 
<A NAME="46"></A>command. Upon this the Syracusans took courage, and immediately marched 
<A NAME="47"></A>out with all their forces to meet Gylippus, who they found was now close 
<A NAME="48"></A>at hand. Meanwhile Gylippus, after taking Ietae, a fort of the Sicels, 
<A NAME="49"></A>on his way, formed his army in order of battle, and so arrived at Epipolae, 
<A NAME="50"></A>and ascending by Euryelus, as the Athenians had done at first, now advanced 
<A NAME="51"></A>with the Syracusans against the Athenian lines. His arrival chanced at 
<A NAME="52"></A>a critical moment. The Athenians had already finished a double wall of 
<A NAME="53"></A>six or seven furlongs to the great harbour, with the exception of a small 
<A NAME="54"></A>portion next the sea, which they were still engaged upon; and in the remainder 
<A NAME="55"></A>of the circle towards Trogilus on the other sea, stones had been laid ready 
<A NAME="56"></A>for building for the greater part of the distance, and some points had 
<A NAME="57"></A>been left half finished, while others were entirely completed. The danger 
<A NAME="58"></A>of Syracuse had indeed been great.
<A NAME="59"></A><BR><BR>Meanwhile the Athenians, recovering from the confusion into which 
<A NAME="60"></A>they had been first thrown by the sudden approach of Gylippus and the Syracusans, 
<A NAME="61"></A>formed in order of battle. Gylippus halted at a short distance off and 
<A NAME="62"></A>sent on a herald to tell them that, if they would evacuate Sicily with 
<A NAME="63"></A>bag and baggage within five days' time, he was willing to make a truce 
<A NAME="64"></A>accordingly. The Athenians treated this proposition with contempt, and 
<A NAME="65"></A>dismissed the herald without an answer. After this both sides began to 
<A NAME="66"></A>prepare for action. Gylippus, observing that the Syracusans were in disorder 
<A NAME="67"></A>and did not easily fall into line, drew off his troops more into the open 
<A NAME="68"></A>ground, while Nicias did not lead on the Athenians but lay still by his 
<A NAME="69"></A>own wall. When Gylippus saw that they did not come on, he led off his army 
<A NAME="70"></A>to the citadel of the quarter of Apollo Temenites, and passed the night 
<A NAME="71"></A>there. On the following day he led out the main body of his army, and, 
<A NAME="72"></A>drawing them up in order of battle before the walls of the Athenians to 
<A NAME="73"></A>prevent their going to the relief of any other quarter, dispatched a strong 
<A NAME="74"></A>force against Fort Labdalum, and took it, and put all whom he found in 
<A NAME="75"></A>it to the sword, the place not being within sight of the Athenians. On 
<A NAME="76"></A>the same day an Athenian galley that lay moored off the harbour was captured 
<A NAME="77"></A>by the Syracusans.
<A NAME="78"></A><BR><BR>After this the Syracusans and their allies began to carry a single 
<A NAME="79"></A>wall, starting from the city, in a slanting direction up Epipolae, in order 
<A NAME="80"></A>that the Athenians, unless they could hinder the work, might be no longer 
<A NAME="81"></A>able to invest them. Meanwhile the Athenians, having now finished their 
<A NAME="82"></A>wall down to the sea, had come up to the heights; and part of their wall 
<A NAME="83"></A>being weak, Gylippus drew out his army by night and attacked it. However, 
<A NAME="84"></A>the Athenians who happened to be bivouacking outside took the alarm and 
<A NAME="85"></A>came out to meet him, upon seeing which he quickly led his men back again. 
<A NAME="86"></A>The Athenians now built their wall higher, and in future kept guard at 
<A NAME="87"></A>this point themselves, disposing their confederates along the remainder 
<A NAME="88"></A>of the works, at the stations assigned to them. Nicias also determined 
<A NAME="89"></A>to fortify Plemmyrium, a promontory over against the city, which juts out 
<A NAME="90"></A>and narrows the mouth of the Great Harbour. He thought that the fortification 
<A NAME="91"></A>of this place would make it easier to bring in supplies, as they would 
<A NAME="92"></A>be able to carry on their blockade from a less distance, near to the port 
<A NAME="93"></A>occupied by the Syracusans; instead of being obliged, upon every movement 
<A NAME="94"></A>of the enemy's navy, to put out against them from the bottom of the great 
<A NAME="95"></A>harbour. Besides this, he now began to pay more attention to the war by 
<A NAME="96"></A>sea, seeing that the coming of Gylippus had diminished their hopes by land. 
<A NAME="97"></A>Accordingly, he conveyed over his ships and some troops, and built three 
<A NAME="98"></A>forts in which he placed most of his baggage, and moored there for the 
<A NAME="99"></A>future the larger craft and men-of-war. This was the first and chief occasion 
<A NAME="100"></A>of the losses which the crews experienced. The water which they used was 
<A NAME="101"></A>scarce and had to be fetched from far, and the sailors could not go out 
<A NAME="102"></A>for firewood without being cut off by the Syracusan horse, who were masters 
<A NAME="103"></A>of the country; a third of the enemy's cavalry being stationed at the little 
<A NAME="104"></A>town of Olympieum, to prevent plundering incursions on the part of the 
<A NAME="105"></A>Athenians at Plemmyrium. Meanwhile Nicias learned that the rest of the 
<A NAME="106"></A>Corinthian fleet was approaching, and sent twenty ships to watch for them, 
<A NAME="107"></A>with orders to be on the look-out for them about Locris and Rhegium and 
<A NAME="108"></A>the approach to Sicily.
<A NAME="109"></A><BR><BR>Gylippus, meanwhile, went on with the wall across Epipolae, using 
<A NAME="110"></A>the stones which the Athenians had laid down for their own wall, and at 
<A NAME="111"></A>the same time constantly led out the Syracusans and their allies, and formed 
<A NAME="112"></A>them in order of battle in front of the lines, the Athenians forming against 
<A NAME="113"></A>him. At last he thought that the moment was come, and began the attack; 
<A NAME="114"></A>and a hand-to-hand fight ensued between the lines, where the Syracusan 
<A NAME="115"></A>cavalry could be of no use; and the Syracusans and their allies were defeated 
<A NAME="116"></A>and took up their dead under truce, while the Athenians erected a trophy. 
<A NAME="117"></A>After this Gylippus called the soldiers together, and said that the fault 
<A NAME="118"></A>was not theirs but his; he had kept their lines too much within the works, 
<A NAME="119"></A>and had thus deprived them of the services of their cavalry and darters. 
<A NAME="120"></A>He would now, therefore, lead them on a second time. He begged them to 
<A NAME="121"></A>remember that in material force they would be fully a match for their opponents, 
<A NAME="122"></A>while, with respect to moral advantages, it were intolerable if Peloponnesians 
<A NAME="123"></A>and Dorians should not feel confident of overcoming Ionians and islanders 
<A NAME="124"></A>with the motley rabble that accompanied them, and of driving them out of 
<A NAME="125"></A>the country.
<A NAME="126"></A><BR><BR>After this he embraced the first opportunity that offered of again 
<A NAME="127"></A>leading them against the enemy. Now Nicias and the Athenians held the opinion 
<A NAME="128"></A>that even if the Syracusans should not wish to offer battle, it was necessary 
<A NAME="129"></A>for them to prevent the building of the cross wall, as it already almost 
<A NAME="130"></A>overlapped the extreme point of their own, and if it went any further it 
<A NAME="131"></A>would from that moment make no difference whether they fought ever so many 
<A NAME="132"></A>successful actions, or never fought at all. They accordingly came out to 
<A NAME="133"></A>meet the Syracusans. Gylippus led out his heavy infantry further from the 
<A NAME="134"></A>fortifications than on the former occasion, and so joined battle; posting 
<A NAME="135"></A>his horse and darters upon the flank of the Athenians in the open space, 
<A NAME="136"></A>where the works of the two walls terminated. During the engagement the 
<A NAME="137"></A>cavalry attacked and routed the left wing of the Athenians, which was opposed 
<A NAME="138"></A>to them; and the rest of the Athenian army was in consequence defeated 
<A NAME="139"></A>by the Syracusans and driven headlong within their lines. The night following 
<A NAME="140"></A>the Syracusans carried their wall up to the Athenian works and passed them, 
<A NAME="141"></A>thus putting it out of their power any longer to stop them, and depriving 
<A NAME="142"></A>them, even if victorious in the field, of all chance of investing the city 
<A NAME="143"></A>for the future.
<A NAME="144"></A><BR><BR>After this the remaining twelve vessels of the Corinthians, Ambraciots, 
<A NAME="145"></A>and Leucadians sailed into the harbour under the command of Erasinides, 
<A NAME="146"></A>a Corinthian, having eluded the Athenian ships on guard, and helped the 
<A NAME="147"></A>Syracusans in completing the remainder of the cross wall. Meanwhile Gylippus 
<A NAME="148"></A>went into the rest of Sicily to raise land and naval forces, and also to 
<A NAME="149"></A>bring over any of the cities that either were lukewarm in the cause or 
<A NAME="150"></A>had hitherto kept out of the war altogether. Syracusan and Corinthian envoys 
<A NAME="151"></A>were also dispatched to Lacedaemon and Corinth to get a fresh force sent 
<A NAME="152"></A>over, in any way that might offer, either in merchant vessels or transports, 
<A NAME="153"></A>or in any other manner likely to prove successful, as the Athenians too 
<A NAME="154"></A>were sending for reinforcements; while the Syracusans proceeded to man 
<A NAME="155"></A>a fleet and to exercise, meaning to try their fortune in this way also, 
<A NAME="156"></A>and generally became exceedingly confident.
<A NAME="157"></A><BR><BR>Nicias perceiving this, and seeing the strength of the enemy and 
<A NAME="158"></A>his own difficulties daily increasing, himself also sent to Athens. He 
<A NAME="159"></A>had before sent frequent reports of events as they occurred, and felt it 
<A NAME="160"></A>especially incumbent upon him to do so now, as he thought that they were 
<A NAME="161"></A>in a critical position, and that, unless speedily recalled or strongly 
<A NAME="162"></A>reinforced from home, they had no hope of safety. He feared, however, that 
<A NAME="163"></A>the messengers, either through inability to speak, or through failure of 
<A NAME="164"></A>memory, or from a wish to please the multitude, might not report the truth, 
<A NAME="165"></A>and so thought it best to write a letter, to ensure that the Athenians 
<A NAME="166"></A>should know his own opinion without its being lost in transmission, and 
<A NAME="167"></A>be able to decide upon the real facts of the case.
<A NAME="168"></A><BR><BR>His emissaries, accordingly, departed with the letter and the requisite 
<A NAME="169"></A>verbal instructions; and he attended to the affairs of the army, making 
<A NAME="170"></A>it his aim now to keep on the defensive and to avoid any unnecessary 
<A NAME="171"></A>danger.
<A NAME="172"></A><BR><BR>At the close of the same summer the Athenian general Euetion marched 
<A NAME="173"></A>in concert with Perdiccas with a large body of Thracians against Amphipolis, 
<A NAME="174"></A>and failing to take it brought some galleys round into the Strymon, and 
<A NAME="175"></A>blockaded the town from the river, having his base at 
<A NAME="176"></A>Himeraeum.
<A NAME="177"></A><BR><BR>Summer was now over. The winter ensuing, the persons sent by Nicias, 
<A NAME="178"></A>reaching Athens, gave the verbal messages which had been entrusted to them, 
<A NAME="179"></A>and answered any questions that were asked them, and delivered the letter. 
<A NAME="180"></A>The clerk of the city now came forward and read out to the Athenians the 
<A NAME="181"></A>letter, which was as follows:
<A NAME="182"></A><BR><BR>"Our past operations, Athenians, have been made known to you by 
<A NAME="183"></A>many other letters; it is now time for you to become equally familiar with 
<A NAME="184"></A>our present condition, and to take your measures accordingly. We had defeated 
<A NAME="185"></A>in most of our engagements with them the Syracusans, against whom we were 
<A NAME="186"></A>sent, and we had built the works which we now occupy, when Gylippus arrived 
<A NAME="187"></A>from Lacedaemon with an army obtained from Peloponnese and from some of 
<A NAME="188"></A>the cities in Sicily. In our first battle with him we were victorious; 
<A NAME="189"></A>in the battle on the following day we were overpowered by a multitude of 
<A NAME="190"></A>cavalry and darters, and compelled to retire within our lines. We have 
<A NAME="191"></A>now, therefore, been forced by the numbers of those opposed to us to discontinue 
<A NAME="192"></A>the work of circumvallation, and to remain inactive; being unable to make 
<A NAME="193"></A>use even of all the force we have, since a large portion of our heavy infantry 
<A NAME="194"></A>is absorbed in the defence of our lines. Meanwhile the enemy have carried 
<A NAME="195"></A>a single wall past our lines, thus making it impossible for us to invest 
<A NAME="196"></A>them in future, until this cross wall be attacked by a strong force and 
<A NAME="197"></A>captured. So that the besieger in name has become, at least from the land 
<A NAME="198"></A>side, the besieged in reality; as we are prevented by their cavalry from 
<A NAME="199"></A>even going for any distance into the country.
<A NAME="200"></A><BR><BR>"Besides this, an embassy has been dispatched to Peloponnese to 
<A NAME="201"></A>procure reinforcements, and Gylippus has gone to the cities in Sicily, 
<A NAME="202"></A>partly in the hope of inducing those that are at present neutral to join 
<A NAME="203"></A>him in the war, partly of bringing from his allies additional contingents 
<A NAME="204"></A>for the land forces and material for the navy. For I understand that they 
<A NAME="205"></A>contemplate a combined attack, upon our lines with their land forces and 
<A NAME="206"></A>with their fleet by sea. You must none of you be surprised that I say by 
<A NAME="207"></A>sea also. They have discovered that the length of the time we have now 
<A NAME="208"></A>been in commission has rotted our ships and wasted our crews, and that 
<A NAME="209"></A>with the entireness of our crews and the soundness of our ships the pristine 
<A NAME="210"></A>efficiency of our navy has departed. For it is impossible for us to haul 
<A NAME="211"></A>our ships ashore and careen them, because, the enemy's vessels being as 
<A NAME="212"></A>many or more than our own, we are constantly anticipating an attack. Indeed, 
<A NAME="213"></A>they may be seen exercising, and it lies with them to take the initiative; 
<A NAME="214"></A>and not having to maintain a blockade, they have greater facilities for 
<A NAME="215"></A>drying their ships.
<A NAME="216"></A><BR><BR>"This we should scarcely be able to do, even if we had plenty of 
<A NAME="217"></A>ships to spare, and were freed from our present necessity of exhausting 
<A NAME="218"></A>all our strength upon the blockade. For it is already difficult to carry 
<A NAME="219"></A>in supplies past Syracuse; and were we to relax our vigilance in the slightest 
<A NAME="220"></A>degree it would become impossible. The losses which our crews have suffered 
<A NAME="221"></A>and still continue to suffer arise from the following causes. Expeditions 
<A NAME="222"></A>for fuel and for forage, and the distance from which water has to be fetched, 
<A NAME="223"></A>cause our sailors to be cut off by the Syracusan cavalry; the loss of our 
<A NAME="224"></A>previous superiority emboldens our slaves to desert; our foreign seamen 
<A NAME="225"></A>are impressed by the unexpected appearance of a navy against us, and the 
<A NAME="226"></A>strength of the enemy's resistance; such of them as were pressed into the 
<A NAME="227"></A>service take the first opportunity of departing to their respective cities; 
<A NAME="228"></A>such as were originally seduced by the temptation of high pay, and expected 
<A NAME="229"></A>little fighting and large gains, leave us either by desertion to the enemy 
<A NAME="230"></A>or by availing themselves of one or other of the various facilities of 
<A NAME="231"></A>escape which the magnitude of Sicily affords them. Some even engage in 
<A NAME="232"></A>trade themselves and prevail upon the captains to take Hyccaric slaves 
<A NAME="233"></A>on board in their place; thus they have ruined the efficiency of our 
<A NAME="234"></A>navy.
<A NAME="235"></A><BR><BR>"Now I need not remind you that the time during which a crew is 
<A NAME="236"></A>in its prime is short, and that the number of sailors who can start a ship 
<A NAME="237"></A>on her way and keep the rowing in time is small. But by far my greatest 
<A NAME="238"></A>trouble is, that holding the post which I do, I am prevented by the natural 
<A NAME="239"></A>indocility of the Athenian seaman from putting a stop to these evils; and 
<A NAME="240"></A>that meanwhile we have no source from which to recruit our crews, which 
<A NAME="241"></A>the enemy can do from many quarters, but are compelled to depend both for 
<A NAME="242"></A>supplying the crews in service and for making good our losses upon the 
<A NAME="243"></A>men whom we brought with us. For our present confederates, Naxos and Catana, 
<A NAME="244"></A>are incapable of supplying us. There is only one thing more wanting to 
<A NAME="245"></A>our opponents, I mean the defection of our Italian markets. If they were 
<A NAME="246"></A>to see you neglect to relieve us from our present condition, and were to 
<A NAME="247"></A>go over to the enemy, famine would compel us to evacuate, and Syracuse 
<A NAME="248"></A>would finish the war without a blow.
<A NAME="249"></A><BR><BR>"I might, it is true, have written to you something different and 
<A NAME="250"></A>more agreeable than this, but nothing certainly more useful, if it is desirable 
<A NAME="251"></A>for you to know the real state of things here before taking your measures. 
<A NAME="252"></A>Besides I know that it is your nature to love to be told the best side 
<A NAME="253"></A>of things, and then to blame the teller if the expectations which he has 
<A NAME="254"></A>raised in your minds are not answered by the result; and I therefore thought 
<A NAME="255"></A>it safest to declare to you the truth.
<A NAME="256"></A><BR><BR>"Now you are not to think that either your generals or your soldiers 
<A NAME="257"></A>have ceased to be a match for the forces originally opposed to them. But 
<A NAME="258"></A>you are to reflect that a general Sicilian coalition is being formed against 
<A NAME="259"></A>us; that a fresh army is expected from Peloponnese, while the force we 
<A NAME="260"></A>have here is unable to cope even with our present antagonists; and you 
<A NAME="261"></A>must promptly decide either to recall us or to send out to us another fleet 
<A NAME="262"></A>and army as numerous again, with a large sum of money, and someone to succeed 
<A NAME="263"></A>me, as a disease in the kidneys unfits me for retaining my post. I have, 
<A NAME="264"></A>I think, some claim on your indulgence, as while I was in my prime I did 
<A NAME="265"></A>you much good service in my commands. But whatever you mean to do, do it 
<A NAME="266"></A>at the commencement of spring and without delay, as the enemy will obtain 
<A NAME="267"></A>his Sicilian reinforcements shortly, those from Peloponnese after a longer 
<A NAME="268"></A>interval; and unless you attend to the matter the former will be here before 
<A NAME="269"></A>you, while the latter will elude you as they have done 
<A NAME="270"></A>before."
<A NAME="271"></A><BR><BR>Such were the contents of Nicias's letter. When the Athenians had 
<A NAME="272"></A>heard it they refused to accept his resignation, but chose him two colleagues, 
<A NAME="273"></A>naming Menander and Euthydemus, two of the officers at the seat of war, 
<A NAME="274"></A>to fill their places until their arrival, that Nicias might not be left 
<A NAME="275"></A>alone in his sickness to bear the whole weight of affairs. They also voted 
<A NAME="276"></A>to send out another army and navy, drawn partly from the Athenians on the 
<A NAME="277"></A>muster-roll, partly from the allies. The colleagues chosen for Nicias were 
<A NAME="278"></A>Demosthenes, son of Alcisthenes, and Eurymedon, son of Thucles. Eurymedon 
<A NAME="279"></A>was sent off at once, about the time of the winter solstice, with ten ships, 
<A NAME="280"></A>a hundred and twenty talents of silver, and instructions to tell the army 
<A NAME="281"></A>that reinforcements would arrive, and that care would be taken of them; 
<A NAME="282"></A>but Demosthenes stayed behind to organize the expedition, meaning to start 
<A NAME="283"></A>as soon as it was spring, and sent for troops to the allies, and meanwhile 
<A NAME="284"></A>got together money, ships, and heavy infantry at home.
<A NAME="285"></A><BR><BR>The Athenians also sent twenty vessels round Peloponnese to prevent 
<A NAME="286"></A>any one crossing over to Sicily from Corinth or Peloponnese. For the Corinthians, 
<A NAME="287"></A>filled with confidence by the favourable alteration in Sicilian affairs 
<A NAME="288"></A>which had been reported by the envoys upon their arrival, and convinced 
<A NAME="289"></A>that the fleet which they had before sent out had not been without its 
<A NAME="290"></A>use, were now preparing to dispatch a force of heavy infantry in merchant 
<A NAME="291"></A>vessels to Sicily, while the Lacedaemonians did the like for the rest of 
<A NAME="292"></A>Peloponnese. The Corinthians also manned a fleet of twenty-five vessels, 
<A NAME="293"></A>intending to try the result of a battle with the squadron on guard at Naupactus, 
<A NAME="294"></A>and meanwhile to make it less easy for the Athenians there to hinder the 
<A NAME="295"></A>departure of their merchantmen, by obliging them to keep an eye upon the 
<A NAME="296"></A>galleys thus arrayed against them.
<A NAME="297"></A><BR><BR>In the meantime the Lacedaemonians prepared for their invasion 
<A NAME="298"></A>of Attica, in accordance with their own previous resolve, and at the instigation 
<A NAME="299"></A>of the Syracusans and Corinthians, who wished for an invasion to arrest 
<A NAME="300"></A>the reinforcements which they heard that Athens was about to send to Sicily. 
<A NAME="301"></A>Alcibiades also urgently advised the fortification of Decelea, and a vigorous 
<A NAME="302"></A>prosecution of the war. But the Lacedaemonians derived most encouragement 
<A NAME="303"></A>from the belief that Athens, with two wars on her hands, against themselves 
<A NAME="304"></A>and against the Siceliots, would be more easy to subdue, and from the conviction 
<A NAME="305"></A>that she had been the first to infringe the truce. In the former war, they 
<A NAME="306"></A>considered, the offence had been more on their own side, both on account 
<A NAME="307"></A>of the entrance of the Thebans into Plataea in time of peace, and also 
<A NAME="308"></A>of their own refusal to listen to the Athenian offer of arbitration, in 
<A NAME="309"></A>spite of the clause in the former treaty that where arbitration should 
<A NAME="310"></A>be offered there should be no appeal to arms. For this reason they thought 
<A NAME="311"></A>that they deserved their misfortunes, and took to heart seriously the disaster 
<A NAME="312"></A>at Pylos and whatever else had befallen them. But when, besides the ravages 
<A NAME="313"></A>from Pylos, which went on without any intermission, the thirty Athenian 
<A NAME="314"></A>ships came out from Argos and wasted part of Epidaurus, Prasiae, and other 
<A NAME="315"></A>places; when upon every dispute that arose as to the interpretation of 
<A NAME="316"></A>any doubtful point in the treaty, their own offers of arbitration were 
<A NAME="317"></A>always rejected by the Athenians, the Lacedaemonians at length decided 
<A NAME="318"></A>that Athens had now committed the very same offence as they had before 
<A NAME="319"></A>done, and had become the guilty party; and they began to be full of ardour 
<A NAME="320"></A>for the war. They spent this winter in sending round to their allies for 
<A NAME="321"></A>iron, and in getting ready the other implements for building their fort; 
<A NAME="322"></A>and meanwhile began raising at home, and also by forced requisitions in 
<A NAME="323"></A>the rest of Peloponnese, a force to be sent out in the merchantmen to their 
<A NAME="324"></A>allies in Sicily. Winter thus ended, and with it the eighteenth year of 
<A NAME="325"></A>this war of which Thucydides is the historian.
<A NAME="326"></A><BR><BR>In the first days of the spring following, at an earlier period 
<A NAME="327"></A>than usual, the Lacedaemonians and their allies invaded Attica, under the 
<A NAME="328"></A>command of Agis, son of Archidamus, king of the Lacedaemonians. They began 
<A NAME="329"></A>by devastating the parts bordering upon the plain, and next proceeded to 
<A NAME="330"></A>fortify Decelea, dividing the work among the different cities. Decelea 
<A NAME="331"></A>is about thirteen or fourteen miles from the city of Athens, and the same 
<A NAME="332"></A>distance or not much further from Boeotia; and the fort was meant to annoy 
<A NAME="333"></A>the plain and the richest parts of the country, being in sight of Athens. 
<A NAME="334"></A>While the Peloponnesians and their allies in Attica were engaged in the 
<A NAME="335"></A>work of fortification, their countrymen at home sent off, at about the 
<A NAME="336"></A>same time, the heavy infantry in the merchant vessels to Sicily; the Lacedaemonians 
<A NAME="337"></A>furnishing a picked force of Helots and Neodamodes (or freedmen), six hundred 
<A NAME="338"></A>heavy infantry in all, under the command of Eccritus, a Spartan; and the 
<A NAME="339"></A>Boeotians three hundred heavy infantry, commanded by two Thebans, Xenon 
<A NAME="340"></A>and Nicon, and by Hegesander, a Thespian. These were among the first to 
<A NAME="341"></A>put out into the open sea, starting from Taenarus in Laconia. Not long 
<A NAME="342"></A>after their departure the Corinthians sent off a force of five hundred 
<A NAME="343"></A>heavy infantry, consisting partly of men from Corinth itself, and partly 
<A NAME="344"></A>of Arcadian mercenaries, placed under the command of Alexarchus, a Corinthian. 
<A NAME="345"></A>The Sicyonians also sent off two hundred heavy infantry at same time as 
<A NAME="346"></A>the Corinthians, under the command of Sargeus, a Sicyonian. Meantime the 
<A NAME="347"></A>five-and-twenty vessels manned by Corinth during the winter lay confronting 
<A NAME="348"></A>the twenty Athenian ships at Naupactus until the heavy infantry in the 
<A NAME="349"></A>merchantmen were fairly on their way from Peloponnese; thus fulfilling 
<A NAME="350"></A>the object for which they had been manned originally, which was to divert 
<A NAME="351"></A>the attention of the Athenians from the merchantmen to the 
<A NAME="352"></A>galleys.
<A NAME="353"></A><BR><BR>During this time the Athenians were not idle. Simultaneously with 
<A NAME="354"></A>the fortification of Decelea, at the very beginning of spring, they sent 
<A NAME="355"></A>thirty ships round Peloponnese, under Charicles, son of Apollodorus, with 
<A NAME="356"></A>instructions to call at Argos and demand a force of their heavy infantry 
<A NAME="357"></A>for the fleet, agreeably to the alliance. At the same time they dispatched 
<A NAME="358"></A>Demosthenes to Sicily, as they had intended, with sixty Athenian and five 
<A NAME="359"></A>Chian vessels, twelve hundred Athenian heavy infantry from the muster-roll, 
<A NAME="360"></A>and as many of the islanders as could be raised in the different quarters, 
<A NAME="361"></A>drawing upon the other subject allies for whatever they could supply that 
<A NAME="362"></A>would be of use for the war. Demosthenes was instructed first to sail round 
<A NAME="363"></A>with Charicles and to operate with him upon the coasts of Laconia, and 
<A NAME="364"></A>accordingly sailed to Aegina and there waited for the remainder of his 
<A NAME="365"></A>armament, and for Charicles to fetch the Argive troops.
<A NAME="366"></A><BR><BR>In Sicily, about the same time in this spring, Gylippus came to 
<A NAME="367"></A>Syracuse with as many troops as he could bring from the cities which he 
<A NAME="368"></A>had persuaded to join. Calling the Syracusans together, he told them that 
<A NAME="369"></A>they must man as many ships as possible, and try their hand at a sea-fight, 
<A NAME="370"></A>by which he hoped to achieve an advantage in the war not unworthy of the 
<A NAME="371"></A>risk. With him Hermocrates actively joined in trying to encourage his countrymen 
<A NAME="372"></A>to attack the Athenians at sea, saying that the latter had not inherited 
<A NAME="373"></A>their naval prowess nor would they retain it for ever; they had been landsmen 
<A NAME="374"></A>even to a greater degree than the Syracusans, and had only become a maritime 
<A NAME="375"></A>power when obliged by the Mede. Besides, to daring spirits like the Athenians, 
<A NAME="376"></A>a daring adversary would seem the most formidable; and the Athenian plan 
<A NAME="377"></A>of paralysing by the boldness of their attack a neighbour often not their 
<A NAME="378"></A>inferior in strength could now be used against them with as good effect 
<A NAME="379"></A>by the Syracusans. He was convinced also that the unlooked-for spectacle 
<A NAME="380"></A>of Syracusans daring to face the Athenian navy would cause a terror to 
<A NAME="381"></A>the enemy, the advantages of which would far outweigh any loss that Athenian 
<A NAME="382"></A>science might inflict upon their inexperience. He accordingly urged them 
<A NAME="383"></A>to throw aside their fears and to try their fortune at sea; and the Syracusans, 
<A NAME="384"></A>under the influence of Gylippus and Hermocrates, and perhaps some others, 
<A NAME="385"></A>made up their minds for the sea-fight and began to man their 
<A NAME="386"></A>vessels.
<A NAME="387"></A><BR><BR>When the fleet was ready, Gylippus led out the whole army by night; 
<A NAME="388"></A>his plan being to assault in person the forts on Plemmyrium by land, while 
<A NAME="389"></A>thirty-five Syracusan galleys sailed according to appointment against the 
<A NAME="390"></A>enemy from the great harbour, and the forty-five remaining came round from 
<A NAME="391"></A>the lesser harbour, where they had their arsenal, in order to effect a 
<A NAME="392"></A>junction with those inside and simultaneously to attack Plemmyrium, and 
<A NAME="393"></A>thus to distract the Athenians by assaulting them on two sides at once. 
<A NAME="394"></A>The Athenians quickly manned sixty ships, and with twenty-five of these 
<A NAME="395"></A>engaged the thirty-five of the Syracusans in the great harbour, sending 
<A NAME="396"></A>the rest to meet those sailing round from the arsenal; and an action now 
<A NAME="397"></A>ensued directly in front of the mouth of the great harbour, maintained 
<A NAME="398"></A>with equal tenacity on both sides; the one wishing to force the passage, 
<A NAME="399"></A>the other to prevent them.
<A NAME="400"></A><BR><BR>In the meantime, while the Athenians in Plemmyrium were down at 
<A NAME="401"></A>the sea, attending to the engagement, Gylippus made a sudden attack on 
<A NAME="402"></A>the forts in the early morning and took the largest first, and afterwards 
<A NAME="403"></A>the two smaller, whose garrisons did not wait for him, seeing the largest 
<A NAME="404"></A>so easily taken. At the fall of the first fort, the men from it who succeeded 
<A NAME="405"></A>in taking refuge in their boats and merchantmen, found great difficulty 
<A NAME="406"></A>in reaching the camp, as the Syracusans were having the best of it in the 
<A NAME="407"></A>engagement in the great harbour, and sent a fast-sailing galley to pursue 
<A NAME="408"></A>them. But when the two others fell, the Syracusans were now being defeated; 
<A NAME="409"></A>and the fugitives from these sailed alongshore with more ease. The Syracusan 
<A NAME="410"></A>ships fighting off the mouth of the harbour forced their way through the 
<A NAME="411"></A>Athenian vessels and sailing in without any order fell foul of one another, 
<A NAME="412"></A>and transferred the victory to the Athenians; who not only routed the squadron 
<A NAME="413"></A>in question, but also that by which they were at first being defeated in 
<A NAME="414"></A>the harbour, sinking eleven of the Syracusan vessels and killing most of 
<A NAME="415"></A>the men, except the crews of three ships whom they made prisoners. Their 
<A NAME="416"></A>own loss was confined to three vessels; and after hauling ashore the Syracusan 
<A NAME="417"></A>wrecks and setting up a trophy upon the islet in front of Plemmyrium, they 
<A NAME="418"></A>retired to their own camp.
<A NAME="419"></A><BR><BR>Unsuccessful at sea, the Syracusans had nevertheless the forts 
<A NAME="420"></A>in Plemmyrium, for which they set up three trophies. One of the two last 
<A NAME="421"></A>taken they razed, but put in order and garrisoned the two others. In the 
<A NAME="422"></A>capture of the forts a great many men were killed and made prisoners, and 
<A NAME="423"></A>a great quantity of property was taken in all. As the Athenians had used 
<A NAME="424"></A>them as a magazine, there was a large stock of goods and corn of the merchants 
<A NAME="425"></A>inside, and also a large stock belonging to the captains; the masts and 
<A NAME="426"></A>other furniture of forty galleys being taken, besides three galleys which 
<A NAME="427"></A>had been drawn up on shore. Indeed the first and chiefest cause of the 
<A NAME="428"></A>ruin of the Athenian army was the capture of Plemmyrium; even the entrance 
<A NAME="429"></A>of the harbour being now no longer safe for carrying in provisions, as 
<A NAME="430"></A>the Syracusan vessels were stationed there to prevent it, and nothing could 
<A NAME="431"></A>be brought in without fighting; besides the general impression of dismay 
<A NAME="432"></A>and discouragement produced upon the army.
<A NAME="433"></A><BR><BR>After this the Syracusans sent out twelve ships under the command 
<A NAME="434"></A>of Agatharchus, a Syracusan. One of these went to Peloponnese with ambassadors 
<A NAME="435"></A>to describe the hopeful state of their affairs, and to incite the Peloponnesians 
<A NAME="436"></A>to prosecute the war there even more actively than they were now doing, 
<A NAME="437"></A>while the eleven others sailed to Italy, hearing that vessels laden with 
<A NAME="438"></A>stores were on their way to the Athenians. After falling in with and destroying 
<A NAME="439"></A>most of the vessels in question, and burning in the Caulonian territory 
<A NAME="440"></A>a quantity of timber for shipbuilding, which had been got ready for the 
<A NAME="441"></A>Athenians, the Syracusan squadron went to Locri, and one of the merchantmen 
<A NAME="442"></A>from Peloponnese coming in, while they were at anchor there, carrying Thespian 
<A NAME="443"></A>heavy infantry, took these on board and sailed alongshore towards home. 
<A NAME="444"></A>The Athenians were on the look-out for them with twenty ships at Megara, 
<A NAME="445"></A>but were only able to take one vessel with its crew; the rest getting clear 
<A NAME="446"></A>off to Syracuse. There was also some skirmishing in the harbour about the 
<A NAME="447"></A>piles which the Syracusans had driven in the sea in front of the old docks, 
<A NAME="448"></A>to allow their ships to lie at anchor inside, without being hurt by the 
<A NAME="449"></A>Athenians sailing up and running them down. The Athenians brought up to 
<A NAME="450"></A>them a ship of ten thousand talents burden furnished with wooden turrets 
<A NAME="451"></A>and screens, and fastened ropes round the piles from their boats, wrenched 
<A NAME="452"></A>them up and broke them, or dived down and sawed them in two. Meanwhile 
<A NAME="453"></A>the Syracusans plied them with missiles from the docks, to which they replied 
<A NAME="454"></A>from their large vessel; until at last most of the piles were removed by 
<A NAME="455"></A>the Athenians. But the most awkward part of the stockade was the part out 
<A NAME="456"></A>of sight: some of the piles which had been driven in did not appear above 
<A NAME="457"></A>water, so that it was dangerous to sail up, for fear of running the ships 
<A NAME="458"></A>upon them, just as upon a reef, through not seeing them. However divers 
<A NAME="459"></A>went down and sawed off even these for reward; although the Syracusans 
<A NAME="460"></A>drove in others. Indeed there was no end to the contrivances to which they 
<A NAME="461"></A>resorted against each other, as might be expected between two hostile armies 
<A NAME="462"></A>confronting each other at such a short distance: and skirmishes and all 
<A NAME="463"></A>kinds of other attempts were of constant occurrence. Meanwhile the Syracusans 
<A NAME="464"></A>sent embassies to the cities, composed of Corinthians, Ambraciots, and 
<A NAME="465"></A>Lacedaemonians, to tell them of the capture of Plemmyrium, and that their 
<A NAME="466"></A>defeat in the sea-fight was due less to the strength of the enemy than 
<A NAME="467"></A>to their own disorder; and generally, to let them know that they were full 
<A NAME="468"></A>of hope, and to desire them to come to their help with ships and troops, 
<A NAME="469"></A>as the Athenians were expected with a fresh army, and if the one already 
<A NAME="470"></A>there could be destroyed before the other arrived, the war would be at 
<A NAME="471"></A>an end.
<A NAME="472"></A><BR><BR>While the contending parties in Sicily were thus engaged, Demosthenes, 
<A NAME="473"></A>having now got together the armament with which he was to go to the island, 
<A NAME="474"></A>put out from Aegina, and making sail for Peloponnese, joined Charicles 
<A NAME="475"></A>and the thirty ships of the Athenians. Taking on board the heavy infantry 
<A NAME="476"></A>from Argos they sailed to Laconia, and, after first plundering part of 
<A NAME="477"></A>Epidaurus Limera, landed on the coast of Laconia, opposite Cythera, where 
<A NAME="478"></A>the temple of Apollo stands, and, laying waste part of the country, fortified 
<A NAME="479"></A>a sort of isthmus, to which the Helots of the Lacedaemonians might desert, 
<A NAME="480"></A>and from whence plundering incursions might be made as from Pylos. Demosthenes 
<A NAME="481"></A>helped to occupy this place, and then immediately sailed on to Corcyra 
<A NAME="482"></A>to take up some of the allies in that island, and so to proceed without 
<A NAME="483"></A>delay to Sicily; while Charicles waited until he had completed the fortification 
<A NAME="484"></A>of the place and, leaving a garrison there, returned home subsequently 
<A NAME="485"></A>with his thirty ships and the Argives also.
<A NAME="486"></A><BR><BR>This same summer arrived at Athens thirteen hundred targeteers, 
<A NAME="487"></A>Thracian swordsmen of the tribe of the Dii, who were to have sailed to 
<A NAME="488"></A>Sicily with Demosthenes. Since they had come too late, the Athenians determined 
<A NAME="489"></A>to send them back to Thrace, whence they had come; to keep them for the 
<A NAME="490"></A>Decelean war appearing too expensive, as the pay of each man was a drachma 
<A NAME="491"></A>a day. Indeed since Decelea had been first fortified by the whole Peloponnesian 
<A NAME="492"></A>army during this summer, and then occupied for the annoyance of the country 
<A NAME="493"></A>by the garrisons from the cities relieving each other at stated intervals, 
<A NAME="494"></A>it had been doing great mischief to the Athenians; in fact this occupation, 
<A NAME="495"></A>by the destruction of property and loss of men which resulted from it, 
<A NAME="496"></A>was one of the principal causes of their ruin. Previously the invasions 
<A NAME="497"></A>were short, and did not prevent their enjoying their land during the rest 
<A NAME="498"></A>of the time: the enemy was now permanently fixed in Attica; at one time 
<A NAME="499"></A>it was an attack in force, at another it was the regular garrison overrunning 
<A NAME="500"></A>the country and making forays for its subsistence, and the Lacedaemonian 
<A NAME="501"></A>king, Agis, was in the field and diligently prosecuting the war; great 
<A NAME="502"></A>mischief was therefore done to the Athenians. They were deprived of their 
<A NAME="503"></A>whole country: more than twenty thousand slaves had deserted, a great part 
<A NAME="504"></A>of them artisans, and all their sheep and beasts of burden were lost; and 
<A NAME="505"></A>as the cavalry rode out daily upon excursions to Decelea and to guard the 
<A NAME="506"></A>country, their horses were either lamed by being constantly worked upon 
<A NAME="507"></A>rocky ground, or wounded by the enemy.
<A NAME="508"></A><BR><BR>Besides, the transport of provisions from Euboea, which had before 
<A NAME="509"></A>been carried on so much more quickly overland by Decelea from Oropus, was 
<A NAME="510"></A>now effected at great cost by sea round Sunium; everything the city required 
<A NAME="511"></A>had to be imported from abroad, and instead of a city it became a fortress. 
<A NAME="512"></A>Summer and winter the Athenians were worn out by having to keep guard on 
<A NAME="513"></A>the fortifications, during the day by turns, by night all together, the 
<A NAME="514"></A>cavalry excepted, at the different military posts or upon the wall. But 
<A NAME="515"></A>what most oppressed them was that they had two wars at once, and had thus 
<A NAME="516"></A>reached a pitch of frenzy which no one would have believed possible if 
<A NAME="517"></A>he had heard of it before it had come to pass. For could any one have imagined 
<A NAME="518"></A>that even when besieged by the Peloponnesians entrenched in Attica, they 
<A NAME="519"></A>would still, instead of withdrawing from Sicily, stay on there besieging 
<A NAME="520"></A>in like manner Syracuse, a town (taken as a town) in no way inferior to 
<A NAME="521"></A>Athens, or would so thoroughly upset the Hellenic estimate of their strength 
<A NAME="522"></A>and audacity, as to give the spectacle of a people which, at the beginning 
<A NAME="523"></A>of the war, some thought might hold out one year, some two, none more than 
<A NAME="524"></A>three, if the Peloponnesians invaded their country, now seventeen years 
<A NAME="525"></A>after the first invasion, after having already suffered from all the evils 
<A NAME="526"></A>of war, going to Sicily and undertaking a new war nothing inferior to that 
<A NAME="527"></A>which they already had with the Peloponnesians? These causes, the great 
<A NAME="528"></A>losses from Decelea, and the other heavy charges that fell upon them, produced 
<A NAME="529"></A>their financial embarrassment; and it was at this time that they imposed 
<A NAME="530"></A>upon their subjects, instead of the tribute, the tax of a twentieth upon 
<A NAME="531"></A>all imports and exports by sea, which they thought would bring them in 
<A NAME="532"></A>more money; their expenditure being now not the same as at first, but having 
<A NAME="533"></A>grown with the war while their revenues decayed.
<A NAME="534"></A><BR><BR>Accordingly, not wishing to incur expense in their present want 
<A NAME="535"></A>of money, they sent back at once the Thracians who came too late for Demosthenes, 
<A NAME="536"></A>under the conduct of Diitrephes, who was instructed, as they were to pass 
<A NAME="537"></A>through the Euripus, to make use of them if possible in the voyage alongshore 
<A NAME="538"></A>to injure the enemy. Diitrephes first landed them at Tanagra and hastily 
<A NAME="539"></A>snatched some booty; he then sailed across the Euripus in the evening from 
<A NAME="540"></A>Chalcis in Euboea and disembarking in Boeotia led them against Mycalessus. 
<A NAME="541"></A>The night he passed unobserved near the temple of Hermes, not quite two 
<A NAME="542"></A>miles from Mycalessus, and at daybreak assaulted and took the town, which 
<A NAME="543"></A>is not a large one; the inhabitants being off their guard and not expecting 
<A NAME="544"></A>that any one would ever come up so far from the sea to molest them, the 
<A NAME="545"></A>wall too being weak, and in some places having tumbled down, while in others 
<A NAME="546"></A>it had not been built to any height, and the gates also being left open 
<A NAME="547"></A>through their feeling of security. The Thracians bursting into Mycalessus 
<A NAME="548"></A>sacked the houses and temples, and butchered the inhabitants, sparing neither 
<A NAME="549"></A>youth nor age, but killing all they fell in with, one after the other, 
<A NAME="550"></A>children and women, and even beasts of burden, and whatever other living 
<A NAME="551"></A>creatures they saw; the Thracian race, like the bloodiest of the barbarians, 
<A NAME="552"></A>being even more so when it has nothing to fear. Everywhere confusion reigned 
<A NAME="553"></A>and death in all its shapes; and in particular they attacked a boys' school, 
<A NAME="554"></A>the largest that there was in the place, into which the children had just 
<A NAME="555"></A>gone, and massacred them all. In short, the disaster falling upon the whole 
<A NAME="556"></A>town was unsurpassed in magnitude, and unapproached by any in suddenness 
<A NAME="557"></A>and in horror.
<A NAME="558"></A><BR><BR>Meanwhile the Thebans heard of it and marched to the rescue, and 
<A NAME="559"></A>overtaking the Thracians before they had gone far, recovered the plunder 
<A NAME="560"></A>and drove them in panic to the Euripus and the sea, where the vessels which 
<A NAME="561"></A>brought them were lying. The greatest slaughter took place while they were 
<A NAME="562"></A>embarking, as they did not know how to swim, and those in the vessels on 
<A NAME="563"></A>seeing what was going on on on shore moored them out of bowshot: in the 
<A NAME="564"></A>rest of the retreat the Thracians made a very respectable defence against 
<A NAME="565"></A>the Theban horse, by which they were first attacked, dashing out and closing 
<A NAME="566"></A>their ranks according to the tactics of their country, and lost only a 
<A NAME="567"></A>few men in that part of the affair. A good number who were after plunder 
<A NAME="568"></A>were actually caught in the town and put to death. Altogether the Thracians 
<A NAME="569"></A>had two hundred and fifty killed out of thirteen hundred, the Thebans and 
<A NAME="570"></A>the rest who came to the rescue about twenty, troopers and heavy infantry, 
<A NAME="571"></A>with Scirphondas, one of the Boeotarchs. The Mycalessians lost a large 
<A NAME="572"></A>proportion of their population.
<A NAME="573"></A><BR><BR>While Mycalessus thus experienced a calamity for its extent as 
<A NAME="574"></A>lamentable as any that happened in the war, Demosthenes, whom we left sailing 
<A NAME="575"></A>to Corcyra, after the building of the fort in Laconia, found a merchantman 
<A NAME="576"></A>lying at Phea in Elis, in which the Corinthian heavy infantry were to cross 
<A NAME="577"></A>to Sicily. The ship he destroyed, but the men escaped, and subsequently 
<A NAME="578"></A>got another in which they pursued their voyage. After this, arriving at 
<A NAME="579"></A>Zacynthus and Cephallenia, he took a body of heavy infantry on board, and 
<A NAME="580"></A>sending for some of the Messenians from Naupactus, crossed over to the 
<A NAME="581"></A>opposite coast of Acarnania, to Alyzia, and to Anactorium which was held 
<A NAME="582"></A>by the Athenians. While he was in these parts he was met by Eurymedon returning 
<A NAME="583"></A>from Sicily, where he had been sent, as has been mentioned, during the 
<A NAME="584"></A>winter, with the money for the army, who told him the news, and also that 
<A NAME="585"></A>he had heard, while at sea, that the Syracusans had taken Plemmyrium. Here, 
<A NAME="586"></A>also, Conon came to them, the commander at Naupactus, with news that the 
<A NAME="587"></A>twenty-five Corinthian ships stationed opposite to him, far from giving 
<A NAME="588"></A>over the war, were meditating an engagement; and he therefore begged them 
<A NAME="589"></A>to send him some ships, as his own eighteen were not a match for the enemy's 
<A NAME="590"></A>twenty-five. Demosthenes and Eurymedon, accordingly, sent ten of their 
<A NAME="591"></A>best sailers with Conon to reinforce the squadron at Naupactus, and meanwhile 
<A NAME="592"></A>prepared for the muster of their forces; Eurymedon, who was now the colleague 
<A NAME="593"></A>of Demosthenes, and had turned back in consequence of his appointment, 
<A NAME="594"></A>sailing to Corcyra to tell them to man fifteen ships and to enlist heavy 
<A NAME="595"></A>infantry; while Demosthenes raised slingers and darters from the parts 
<A NAME="596"></A>about Acarnania.
<A NAME="597"></A><BR><BR>Meanwhile the envoys, already mentioned, who had gone from Syracuse 
<A NAME="598"></A>to the cities after the capture of Plemmyrium, had succeeded in their mission, 
<A NAME="599"></A>and were about to bring the army that they had collected, when Nicias got 
<A NAME="600"></A>scent of it, and sent to the Centoripae and Alicyaeans and other of the 
<A NAME="601"></A>friendly Sicels, who held the passes, not to let the enemy through, but 
<A NAME="602"></A>to combine to prevent their passing, there being no other way by which 
<A NAME="603"></A>they could even attempt it, as the Agrigentines would not give them a passage 
<A NAME="604"></A>through their country. Agreeably to this request the Sicels laid a triple 
<A NAME="605"></A>ambuscade for the Siceliots upon their march, and attacking them suddenly, 
<A NAME="606"></A>while off their guard, killed about eight hundred of them and all the envoys, 
<A NAME="607"></A>the Corinthian only excepted, by whom fifteen hundred who escaped were 
<A NAME="608"></A>conducted to Syracuse.
<A NAME="609"></A><BR><BR>About the same time the Camarinaeans also came to the assistance 
<A NAME="610"></A>of Syracuse with five hundred heavy infantry, three hundred darters, and 
<A NAME="611"></A>as many archers, while the Geloans sent crews for five ships, four hundred 
<A NAME="612"></A>darters, and two hundred horse. Indeed almost the whole of Sicily, except 
<A NAME="613"></A>the Agrigentines, who were neutral, now ceased merely to watch events as 
<A NAME="614"></A>it had hitherto done, and actively joined Syracuse against the 
<A NAME="615"></A>Athenians.
<A NAME="616"></A><BR><BR>While the Syracusans after the Sicel disaster put off any immediate 
<A NAME="617"></A>attack upon the Athenians, Demosthenes and Eurymedon, whose forces from 
<A NAME="618"></A>Corcyra and the continent were now ready, crossed the Ionian Gulf with 
<A NAME="619"></A>all their armament to the Iapygian promontory, and starting from thence 
<A NAME="620"></A>touched at the Choerades Isles lying off Iapygia, where they took on board 
<A NAME="621"></A>a hundred and fifty Iapygian darters of the Messapian tribe, and after 
<A NAME="622"></A>renewing an old friendship with Artas the chief, who had furnished them 
<A NAME="623"></A>with the darters, arrived at Metapontium in Italy. Here they persuaded 
<A NAME="624"></A>their allies the Metapontines to send with them three hundred darters and 
<A NAME="625"></A>two galleys, and with this reinforcement coasted on to Thurii, where they 
<A NAME="626"></A>found the party hostile to Athens recently expelled by a revolution, and 
<A NAME="627"></A>accordingly remained there to muster and review the whole army, to see 
<A NAME="628"></A>if any had been left behind, and to prevail upon the Thurians resolutely 
<A NAME="629"></A>to join them in their expedition, and in the circumstances in which they 
<A NAME="630"></A>found themselves to conclude a defensive and offensive alliance with the 
<A NAME="631"></A>Athenians.
<A NAME="632"></A><BR><BR>About the same time the Peloponnesians in the twenty-five ships 
<A NAME="633"></A>stationed opposite to the squadron at Naupactus to protect the passage 
<A NAME="634"></A>of the transports to Sicily had got ready for engaging, and manning some 
<A NAME="635"></A>additional vessels, so as to be numerically little inferior to the Athenians, 
<A NAME="636"></A>anchored off Erineus in Achaia in the Rhypic country. The place off which 
<A NAME="637"></A>they lay being in the form of a crescent, the land forces furnished by 
<A NAME="638"></A>the Corinthians and their allies on the spot came up and ranged themselves 
<A NAME="639"></A>upon the projecting headlands on either side, while the fleet, under the 
<A NAME="640"></A>command of Polyanthes, a Corinthian, held the intervening space and blocked 
<A NAME="641"></A>up the entrance. The Athenians under Diphilus now sailed out against them 
<A NAME="642"></A>with thirty-three ships from Naupactus, and the Corinthians, at first not 
<A NAME="643"></A>moving, at length thought they saw their opportunity, raised the signal, 
<A NAME="644"></A>and advanced and engaged the Athenians. After an obstinate struggle, the 
<A NAME="645"></A>Corinthians lost three ships, and without sinking any altogether, disabled 
<A NAME="646"></A>seven of the enemy, which were struck prow to prow and had their foreships 
<A NAME="647"></A>stove in by the Corinthian vessels, whose cheeks had been strengthened 
<A NAME="648"></A>for this very purpose. After an action of this even character, in which 
<A NAME="649"></A>either party could claim the victory (although the Athenians became masters 
<A NAME="650"></A>of the wrecks through the wind driving them out to sea, the Corinthians 
<A NAME="651"></A>not putting out again to meet them), the two combatants parted. No pursuit 
<A NAME="652"></A>took place, and no prisoners were made on either side; the Corinthians 
<A NAME="653"></A>and Peloponnesians who were fighting near the shore escaping with ease, 
<A NAME="654"></A>and none of the Athenian vessels having been sunk. The Athenians now sailed 
<A NAME="655"></A>back to Naupactus, and the Corinthians immediately set up a trophy as victors, 
<A NAME="656"></A>because they had disabled a greater number of the enemy's ships. Moreover 
<A NAME="657"></A>they held that they had not been worsted, for the very same reason that 
<A NAME="658"></A>their opponent held that he had not been victorious; the Corinthians considering 
<A NAME="659"></A>that they were conquerors, if not decidedly conquered, and the Athenians 
<A NAME="660"></A>thinking themselves vanquished, because not decidedly victorious. However, 
<A NAME="661"></A>when the Peloponnesians sailed off and their land forces had dispersed, 
<A NAME="662"></A>the Athenians also set up a trophy as victors in Achaia, about two miles 
<A NAME="663"></A>and a quarter from Erineus, the Corinthian station.
<A NAME="664"></A><BR><BR>This was the termination of the action at Naupactus. To return 
<A NAME="665"></A>to Demosthenes and Eurymedon: the Thurians having now got ready to join 
<A NAME="666"></A>in the expedition with seven hundred heavy infantry and three hundred darters, 
<A NAME="667"></A>the two generals ordered the ships to sail along the coast to the Crotonian 
<A NAME="668"></A>territory, and meanwhile held a review of all the land forces upon the 
<A NAME="669"></A>river Sybaris, and then led them through the Thurian country. Arrived at 
<A NAME="670"></A>the river Hylias, they here received a message from the Crotonians, saying 
<A NAME="671"></A>that they would not allow the army to pass through their country; upon 
<A NAME="672"></A>which the Athenians descended towards the shore, and bivouacked near the 
<A NAME="673"></A>sea and the mouth of the Hylias, where the fleet also met them, and the 
<A NAME="674"></A>next day embarked and sailed along the coast touching at all the cities 
<A NAME="675"></A>except Locri, until they came to Petra in the Rhegian 
<A NAME="676"></A>territory.
<A NAME="677"></A><BR><BR>Meanwhile the Syracusans hearing of their approach resolved to 
<A NAME="678"></A>make a second attempt with their fleet and their other forces on shore, 
<A NAME="679"></A>which they had been collecting for this very purpose in order to do something 
<A NAME="680"></A>before their arrival. In addition to other improvements suggested by the 
<A NAME="681"></A>former sea-fight which they now adopted in the equipment of their navy, 
<A NAME="682"></A>they cut down their prows to a smaller compass to make them more solid 
<A NAME="683"></A>and made their cheeks stouter, and from these let stays into the vessels' 
<A NAME="684"></A>sides for a length of six cubits within and without, in the same way as 
<A NAME="685"></A>the Corinthians had altered their prows before engaging the squadron at 
<A NAME="686"></A>Naupactus. The Syracusans thought that they would thus have an advantage 
<A NAME="687"></A>over the Athenian vessels, which were not constructed with equal strength, 
<A NAME="688"></A>but were slight in the bows, from their being more used to sail round and 
<A NAME="689"></A>charge the enemy's side than to meet him prow to prow, and that the battle 
<A NAME="690"></A>being in the great harbour, with a great many ships in not much room, was 
<A NAME="691"></A>also a fact in their favour. Charging prow to prow, they would stave in 
<A NAME="692"></A>the enemy's bows, by striking with solid and stout beaks against hollow 
<A NAME="693"></A>and weak ones; and secondly, the Athenians for want of room would be unable 
<A NAME="694"></A>to use their favourite manoeuvre of breaking the line or of sailing round, 
<A NAME="695"></A>as the Syracusans would do their best not to let them do the one, and want 
<A NAME="696"></A>of room would prevent their doing the other. This charging prow to prow, 
<A NAME="697"></A>which had hitherto been thought want of skill in a helmsman, would be the 
<A NAME="698"></A>Syracusans' chief manoeuvre, as being that which they should find most 
<A NAME="699"></A>useful, since the Athenians, if repulsed, would not be able to back water 
<A NAME="700"></A>in any direction except towards the shore, and that only for a little way, 
<A NAME="701"></A>and in the little space in front of their own camp. The rest of the harbour 
<A NAME="702"></A>would be commanded by the Syracusans; and the Athenians, if hard pressed, 
<A NAME="703"></A>by crowding together in a small space and all to the same point, would 
<A NAME="704"></A>run foul of one another and fall into disorder, which was, in fact, the 
<A NAME="705"></A>thing that did the Athenians most harm in all the sea-fights, they not 
<A NAME="706"></A>having, like the Syracusans, the whole harbour to retreat over. As to their 
<A NAME="707"></A>sailing round into the open sea, this would be impossible, with the Syracusans 
<A NAME="708"></A>in possession of the way out and in, especially as Plemmyrium would be 
<A NAME="709"></A>hostile to them, and the mouth of the harbour was not 
<A NAME="710"></A>large.
<A NAME="711"></A><BR><BR>With these contrivances to suit their skill and ability, and now 
<A NAME="712"></A>more confident after the previous sea-fight, the Syracusans attacked by 
<A NAME="713"></A>land and sea at once. The town force Gylippus led out a little the first 
<A NAME="714"></A>and brought them up to the wall of the Athenians, where it looked towards 
<A NAME="715"></A>the city, while the force from the Olympieum, that is to say, the heavy 
<A NAME="716"></A>infantry that were there with the horse and the light troops of the Syracusans, 
<A NAME="717"></A>advanced against the wall from the opposite side; the ships of the Syracusans 
<A NAME="718"></A>and allies sailing out immediately afterwards. The Athenians at first fancied 
<A NAME="719"></A>that they were to be attacked by land only, and it was not without alarm 
<A NAME="720"></A>that they saw the fleet suddenly approaching as well; and while some were 
<A NAME="721"></A>forming upon the walls and in front of them against the advancing enemy, 
<A NAME="722"></A>and some marching out in haste against the numbers of horse and darters 
<A NAME="723"></A>coming from the Olympieum and from outside, others manned the ships or 
<A NAME="724"></A>rushed down to the beach to oppose the enemy, and when the ships were manned 
<A NAME="725"></A>put out with seventy-five sail against about eighty of the 
<A NAME="726"></A>Syracusans.
<A NAME="727"></A><BR><BR>After spending a great part of the day in advancing and retreating 
<A NAME="728"></A>and skirmishing with each other, without either being able to gain any 
<A NAME="729"></A>advantage worth speaking of, except that the Syracusans sank one or two 
<A NAME="730"></A>of the Athenian vessels, they parted, the land force at the same time retiring 
<A NAME="731"></A>from the lines. The next day the Syracusans remained quiet, and gave no 
<A NAME="732"></A>signs of what they were going to do; but Nicias, seeing that the battle 
<A NAME="733"></A>had been a drawn one, and expecting that they would attack again, compelled 
<A NAME="734"></A>the captains to refit any of the ships that had suffered, and moored merchant 
<A NAME="735"></A>vessels before the stockade which they had driven into the sea in front 
<A NAME="736"></A>of their ships, to serve instead of an enclosed harbour, at about two hundred 
<A NAME="737"></A>feet from each other, in order that any ship that was hard pressed might 
<A NAME="738"></A>be able to retreat in safety and sail out again at leisure. These preparations 
<A NAME="739"></A>occupied the Athenians all day until nightfall.
<A NAME="740"></A><BR><BR>The next day the Syracusans began operations at an earlier hour, 
<A NAME="741"></A>but with the same plan of attack by land and sea. A great part of the day 
<A NAME="742"></A>the rivals spent as before, confronting and skirmishing with each other; 
<A NAME="743"></A>until at last Ariston, son of Pyrrhicus, a Corinthian, the ablest helmsman 
<A NAME="744"></A>in the Syracusan service, persuaded their naval commanders to send to the 
<A NAME="745"></A>officials in the city, and tell them to move the sale market as quickly 
<A NAME="746"></A>as they could down to the sea, and oblige every one to bring whatever eatables 
<A NAME="747"></A>he had and sell them there, thus enabling the commanders to land the crews 
<A NAME="748"></A>and dine at once close to the ships, and shortly afterwards, the selfsame 
<A NAME="749"></A>day, to attack the Athenians again when they were not expecting 
<A NAME="750"></A>it.
<A NAME="751"></A><BR><BR>In compliance with this advice a messenger was sent and the market 
<A NAME="752"></A>got ready, upon which the Syracusans suddenly backed water and withdrew 
<A NAME="753"></A>to the town, and at once landed and took their dinner upon the spot; while 
<A NAME="754"></A>the Athenians, supposing that they had returned to the town because they 
<A NAME="755"></A>felt they were beaten, disembarked at their leisure and set about getting 
<A NAME="756"></A>their dinners and about their other occupations, under the idea that they 
<A NAME="757"></A>done with fighting for that day. Suddenly the Syracusans had manned their 
<A NAME="758"></A>ships and again sailed against them; and the Athenians, in great confusion 
<A NAME="759"></A>and most of them fasting, got on board, and with great difficulty put out 
<A NAME="760"></A>to meet them. For some time both parties remained on the defensive without 
<A NAME="761"></A>engaging, until the Athenians at last resolved not to let themselves be 
<A NAME="762"></A>worn out by waiting where they were, but to attack without delay, and giving 
<A NAME="763"></A>a cheer, went into action. The Syracusans received them, and charging prow 
<A NAME="764"></A>to prow as they had intended, stove in a great part of the Athenian foreships 
<A NAME="765"></A>by the strength of their beaks; the darters on the decks also did great 
<A NAME="766"></A>damage to the Athenians, but still greater damage was done by the Syracusans 
<A NAME="767"></A>who went about in small boats, ran in upon the oars of the Athenian galleys, 
<A NAME="768"></A>and sailed against their sides, and discharged from thence their darts 
<A NAME="769"></A>upon the sailors.
<A NAME="770"></A><BR><BR>At last, fighting hard in this fashion, the Syracusans gained the 
<A NAME="771"></A>victory, and the Athenians turned and fled between the merchantmen to their 
<A NAME="772"></A>own station. The Syracusan ships pursued them as far as the merchantmen, 
<A NAME="773"></A>where they were stopped by the beams armed with dolphins suspended from 
<A NAME="774"></A>those vessels over the passage. Two of the Syracusan vessels went too near 
<A NAME="775"></A>in the excitement of victory and were destroyed, one of them being taken 
<A NAME="776"></A>with its crew. After sinking seven of the Athenian vessels and disabling 
<A NAME="777"></A>many, and taking most of the men prisoners and killing others, the Syracusans 
<A NAME="778"></A>retired and set up trophies for both the engagements, being now confident 
<A NAME="779"></A>of having a decided superiority by sea, and by no means despairing of equal 
<A NAME="780"></A>success by land.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="781"></A><B>Chapter XXII</B>

<A NAME="782"></A><BR><BR><B>Nineteenth Year of the War - Arrival of Demosthenes</B> <B>- 
<A NAME="783"></A>Defeat of the Athenians at Epipolae -</B> <B>Folly and Obstinancy of 
<A NAME="784"></A>Nicias</B>
<A NAME="785"></A><BR><BR>In the meantime, while the Syracusans were preparing for a second 
<A NAME="786"></A>attack upon both elements, Demosthenes and Eurymedon arrived with the succours 
<A NAME="787"></A>from Athens, consisting of about seventy-three ships, including the foreigners; 
<A NAME="788"></A>nearly five thousand heavy infantry, Athenian and allied; a large number 
<A NAME="789"></A>of darters, Hellenic and barbarian, and slingers and archers and everything 
<A NAME="790"></A>else upon a corresponding scale. The Syracusans and their allies were for 
<A NAME="791"></A>the moment not a little dismayed at the idea that there was to be no term 
<A NAME="792"></A>or ending to their dangers, seeing, in spite of the fortification of Decelea, 
<A NAME="793"></A>a new army arrive nearly equal to the former, and the power of Athens proving 
<A NAME="794"></A>so great in every quarter. On the other hand, the first Athenian armament 
<A NAME="795"></A>regained a certain confidence in the midst of its misfortunes. Demosthenes, 
<A NAME="796"></A>seeing how matters stood, felt that he could not drag on and fare as Nicias 
<A NAME="797"></A>had done, who by wintering in Catana instead of at once attacking Syracuse 
<A NAME="798"></A>had allowed the terror of his first arrival to evaporate in contempt, and 
<A NAME="799"></A>had given time to Gylippus to arrive with a force from Peloponnese, which 
<A NAME="800"></A>the Syracusans would never have sent for if he had attacked immediately; 
<A NAME="801"></A>for they fancied that they were a match for him by themselves, and would 
<A NAME="802"></A>not have discovered their inferiority until they were already invested, 
<A NAME="803"></A>and even if they then sent for succours, they would no longer have been 
<A NAME="804"></A>equally able to profit by their arrival. Recollecting this, and well aware 
<A NAME="805"></A>that it was now on the first day after his arrival that he like Nicias 
<A NAME="806"></A>was most formidable to the enemy, Demosthenes determined to lose no time 
<A NAME="807"></A>in drawing the utmost profit from the consternation at the moment inspired 
<A NAME="808"></A>by his army; and seeing that the counterwall of the Syracusans, which hindered 
<A NAME="809"></A>the Athenians from investing them, was a single one, and that he who should 
<A NAME="810"></A>become master of the way up to Epipolae, and afterwards of the camp there, 
<A NAME="811"></A>would find no difficulty in taking it, as no one would even wait for his 
<A NAME="812"></A>attack, made all haste to attempt the enterprise. This he took to be the 
<A NAME="813"></A>shortest way of ending the war, as he would either succeed and take Syracuse, 
<A NAME="814"></A>or would lead back the armament instead of frittering away the lives of 
<A NAME="815"></A>the Athenians engaged in the expedition and the resources of the country 
<A NAME="816"></A>at large.
<A NAME="817"></A><BR><BR>First therefore the Athenians went out and laid waste the lands 
<A NAME="818"></A>of the Syracusans about the Anapus and carried all before them as at first 
<A NAME="819"></A>by land and by sea, the Syracusans not offering to oppose them upon either 
<A NAME="820"></A>element, unless it were with their cavalry and darters from the Olympieum. 
<A NAME="821"></A>Next Demosthenes resolved to attempt the counterwall first by means of 
<A NAME="822"></A>engines. As however the engines that he brought up were burnt by the enemy 
<A NAME="823"></A>fighting from the wall, and the rest of the forces repulsed after attacking 
<A NAME="824"></A>at many different points, he determined to delay no longer, and having 
<A NAME="825"></A>obtained the consent of Nicias and his fellow commanders, proceeded to 
<A NAME="826"></A>put in execution his plan of attacking Epipolae. As by day it seemed impossible 
<A NAME="827"></A>to approach and get up without being observed, he ordered provisions for 
<A NAME="828"></A>five days, took all the masons and carpenters, and other things, such as 
<A NAME="829"></A>arrows, and everything else that they could want for the work of fortification 
<A NAME="830"></A>if successful, and, after the first watch, set out with Eurymedon and Menander 
<A NAME="831"></A>and the whole army for Epipolae, Nicias being left behind in the lines. 
<A NAME="832"></A>Having come up by the hill of Euryelus (where the former army had ascended 
<A NAME="833"></A>at first) unobserved by the enemy's guards, they went up to the fort which 
<A NAME="834"></A>the Syracusans had there, and took it, and put to the sword part of the 
<A NAME="835"></A>garrison. The greater number, however, escaped at once and gave the alarm 
<A NAME="836"></A>to the camps, of which there were three upon Epipolae, defended by outworks, 
<A NAME="837"></A>one of the Syracusans, one of the other Siceliots, and one of the allies; 
<A NAME="838"></A>and also to the six hundred Syracusans forming the original garrison for 
<A NAME="839"></A>this part of Epipolae. These at once advanced against the assailants and, 
<A NAME="840"></A>falling in with Demosthenes and the Athenians, were routed by them after 
<A NAME="841"></A>a sharp resistance, the victors immediately pushing on, eager to achieve 
<A NAME="842"></A>the objects of the attack without giving time for their ardour to cool; 
<A NAME="843"></A>meanwhile others from the very beginning were taking the counterwall of 
<A NAME="844"></A>the Syracusans, which was abandoned by its garrison, and pulling down the 
<A NAME="845"></A>battlements. The Syracusans and the allies, and Gylippus with the troops 
<A NAME="846"></A>under his command, advanced to the rescue from the outworks, but engaged 
<A NAME="847"></A>in some consternation (a night attack being a piece of audacity which they 
<A NAME="848"></A>had never expected), and were at first compelled to retreat. But while 
<A NAME="849"></A>the Athenians, flushed with their victory, now advanced with less order, 
<A NAME="850"></A>wishing to make their way as quickly as possible through the whole force 
<A NAME="851"></A>of the enemy not yet engaged, without relaxing their attack or giving them 
<A NAME="852"></A>time to rally, the Boeotians made the first stand against them, attacked 
<A NAME="853"></A>them, routed them, and put them to flight.
<A NAME="854"></A><BR><BR>The Athenians now fell into great disorder and perplexity, so that 
<A NAME="855"></A>it was not easy to get from one side or the other any detailed account 
<A NAME="856"></A>of the affair. By day certainly the combatants have a clearer notion, though 
<A NAME="857"></A>even then by no means of all that takes place, no one knowing much of anything 
<A NAME="858"></A>that does not go on in his own immediate neighbourhood; but in a night 
<A NAME="859"></A>engagement (and this was the only one that occurred between great armies 
<A NAME="860"></A>during the war) how could any one know anything for certain? Although there 
<A NAME="861"></A>was a bright moon they saw each other only as men do by moonlight, that 
<A NAME="862"></A>is to say, they could distinguish the form of the body, but could not tell 
<A NAME="863"></A>for certain whether it was a friend or an enemy. Both had great numbers 
<A NAME="864"></A>of heavy infantry moving about in a small space. Some of the Athenians 
<A NAME="865"></A>were already defeated, while others were coming up yet unconquered for 
<A NAME="866"></A>their first attack. A large part also of the rest of their forces either 
<A NAME="867"></A>had only just got up, or were still ascending, so that they did not know 
<A NAME="868"></A>which way to march. Owing to the rout that had taken place all in front 
<A NAME="869"></A>was now in confusion, and the noise made it difficult to distinguish anything. 
<A NAME="870"></A>The victorious Syracusans and allies were cheering each other on with loud 
<A NAME="871"></A>cries, by night the only possible means of communication, and meanwhile 
<A NAME="872"></A>receiving all who came against them; while the Athenians were seeking for 
<A NAME="873"></A>one another, taking all in front of them for enemies, even although they 
<A NAME="874"></A>might be some of their now flying friends; and by constantly asking for 
<A NAME="875"></A>the watchword, which was their only means of recognition, not only caused 
<A NAME="876"></A>great confusion among themselves by asking all at once, but also made it 
<A NAME="877"></A>known to the enemy, whose own they did not so readily discover, as the 
<A NAME="878"></A>Syracusans were victorious and not scattered, and thus less easily mistaken. 
<A NAME="879"></A>The result was that if the Athenians fell in with a party of the enemy 
<A NAME="880"></A>that was weaker than they, it escaped them through knowing their watchword; 
<A NAME="881"></A>while if they themselves failed to answer they were put to the sword. But 
<A NAME="882"></A>what hurt them as much, or indeed more than anything else, was the singing 
<A NAME="883"></A>of the paean, from the perplexity which it caused by being nearly the same 
<A NAME="884"></A>on either side; the Argives and Corcyraeans and any other Dorian peoples 
<A NAME="885"></A>in the army, struck terror into the Athenians whenever they raised their 
<A NAME="886"></A>paean, no less than did the enemy. Thus, after being once thrown into disorder, 
<A NAME="887"></A>they ended by coming into collision with each other in many parts of the 
<A NAME="888"></A>field, friends with friends, and citizens with citizens, and not only terrified 
<A NAME="889"></A>one another, but even came to blows and could only be parted with difficulty. 
<A NAME="890"></A>In the pursuit many perished by throwing themselves down the cliffs, the 
<A NAME="891"></A>way down from Epipolae being narrow; and of those who got down safely into 
<A NAME="892"></A>the plain, although many, especially those who belonged to the first armament, 
<A NAME="893"></A>escaped through their better acquaintance with the locality, some of the 
<A NAME="894"></A>newcomers lost their way and wandered over the country, and were cut off 
<A NAME="895"></A>in the morning by the Syracusan cavalry and killed.
<A NAME="896"></A><BR><BR>The next day the Syracusans set up two trophies, one upon Epipolae 
<A NAME="897"></A>where the ascent had been made, and the other on the spot where the first 
<A NAME="898"></A>check was given by the Boeotians; and the Athenians took back their dead 
<A NAME="899"></A>under truce. A great many of the Athenians and allies were killed, although 
<A NAME="900"></A>still more arms were taken than could be accounted for by the number of 
<A NAME="901"></A>the dead, as some of those who were obliged to leap down from the cliffs 
<A NAME="902"></A>without their shields escaped with their lives and did not perish like 
<A NAME="903"></A>the rest.
<A NAME="904"></A><BR><BR>After this the Syracusans, recovering their old confidence at such 
<A NAME="905"></A>an unexpected stroke of good fortune, dispatched Sicanus with fifteen ships 
<A NAME="906"></A>to Agrigentum where there was a revolution, to induce if possible the city 
<A NAME="907"></A>to join them; while Gylippus again went by land into the rest of Sicily 
<A NAME="908"></A>to bring up reinforcements, being now in hope of taking the Athenian lines 
<A NAME="909"></A>by storm, after the result of the affair on Epipolae.
<A NAME="910"></A><BR><BR>In the meantime the Athenian generals consulted upon the disaster 
<A NAME="911"></A>which had happened, and upon the general weakness of the army. They saw 
<A NAME="912"></A>themselves unsuccessful in their enterprises, and the soldiers disgusted 
<A NAME="913"></A>with their stay; disease being rife among them owing to its being the sickly 
<A NAME="914"></A>season of the year, and to the marshy and unhealthy nature of the spot 
<A NAME="915"></A>in which they were encamped; and the state of their affairs generally being 
<A NAME="916"></A>thought desperate. Accordingly, Demosthenes was of opinion that they ought 
<A NAME="917"></A>not to stay any longer; but agreeably to his original idea in risking the 
<A NAME="918"></A>attempt upon Epipolae, now that this had failed, he gave his vote for going 
<A NAME="919"></A>away without further loss of time, while the sea might yet be crossed, 
<A NAME="920"></A>and their late reinforcement might give them the superiority at all events 
<A NAME="921"></A>on that element. He also said that it would be more profitable for the 
<A NAME="922"></A>state to carry on the war against those who were building fortifications 
<A NAME="923"></A>in Attica, than against the Syracusans whom it was no longer easy to subdue; 
<A NAME="924"></A>besides which it was not right to squander large sums of money to no purpose 
<A NAME="925"></A>by going on with the siege.
<A NAME="926"></A><BR><BR>This was the opinion of Demosthenes. Nicias, without denying the 
<A NAME="927"></A>bad state of their affairs, was unwilling to avow their weakness, or to 
<A NAME="928"></A>have it reported to the enemy that the Athenians in full council were openly 
<A NAME="929"></A>voting for retreat; for in that case they would be much less likely to 
<A NAME="930"></A>effect it when they wanted without discovery. Moreover, his own particular 
<A NAME="931"></A>information still gave him reason to hope that the affairs of the enemy 
<A NAME="932"></A>would soon be in a worse state than their own, if the Athenians persevered 
<A NAME="933"></A>in the siege; as they would wear out the Syracusans by want of money, especially 
<A NAME="934"></A>with the more extensive command of the sea now given them by their present 
<A NAME="935"></A>navy. Besides this, there was a party in Syracuse who wished to betray 
<A NAME="936"></A>the city to the Athenians, and kept sending him messages and telling him 
<A NAME="937"></A>not to raise the siege. Accordingly, knowing this and really waiting because 
<A NAME="938"></A>he hesitated between the two courses and wished to see his way more clearly, 
<A NAME="939"></A>in his public speech on this occasion he refused to lead off the army, 
<A NAME="940"></A>saying he was sure the Athenians would never approve of their returning 
<A NAME="941"></A>without a vote of theirs. Those who would vote upon their conduct, instead 
<A NAME="942"></A>of judging the facts as eye-witnesses like themselves and not from what 
<A NAME="943"></A>they might hear from hostile critics, would simply be guided by the calumnies 
<A NAME="944"></A>of the first clever speaker; while many, indeed most, of the soldiers on 
<A NAME="945"></A>the spot, who now so loudly proclaimed the danger of their position, when 
<A NAME="946"></A>they reached Athens would proclaim just as loudly the opposite, and would 
<A NAME="947"></A>say that their generals had been bribed to betray them and return. For 
<A NAME="948"></A>himself, therefore, who knew the Athenian temper, sooner than perish under 
<A NAME="949"></A>a dishonourable charge and by an unjust sentence at the hands of the Athenians, 
<A NAME="950"></A>he would rather take his chance and die, if die he must, a soldier's death 
<A NAME="951"></A>at the hand of the enemy. Besides, after all, the Syracusans were in a 
<A NAME="952"></A>worse case than themselves. What with paying mercenaries, spending upon 
<A NAME="953"></A>fortified posts, and now for a full year maintaining a large navy, they 
<A NAME="954"></A>were already at a loss and would soon be at a standstill: they had already 
<A NAME="955"></A>spent two thousand talents and incurred heavy debts besides, and could 
<A NAME="956"></A>not lose even ever so small a fraction of their present force through not 
<A NAME="957"></A>paying it, without ruin to their cause; depending as they did more upon 
<A NAME="958"></A>mercenaries than upon soldiers obliged to serve, like their own. He therefore 
<A NAME="959"></A>said that they ought to stay and carry on the siege, and not depart defeated 
<A NAME="960"></A>in point of money, in which they were much superior.
<A NAME="961"></A><BR><BR>Nicias spoke positively because he had exact information of the 
<A NAME="962"></A>financial distress at Syracuse, and also because of the strength of the 
<A NAME="963"></A>Athenian party there which kept sending him messages not to raise the siege; 
<A NAME="964"></A>besides which he had more confidence than before in his fleet, and felt 
<A NAME="965"></A>sure at least of its success. Demosthenes, however, would not hear for 
<A NAME="966"></A>a moment of continuing the siege, but said that if they could not lead 
<A NAME="967"></A>off the army without a decree from Athens, and if they were obliged to 
<A NAME="968"></A>stay on, they ought to remove to Thapsus or Catana; where their land forces 
<A NAME="969"></A>would have a wide extent of country to overrun, and could live by plundering 
<A NAME="970"></A>the enemy, and would thus do them damage; while the fleet would have the 
<A NAME="971"></A>open sea to fight in, that is to say, instead of a narrow space which was 
<A NAME="972"></A>all in the enemy's favour, a wide sea-room where their science would be 
<A NAME="973"></A>of use, and where they could retreat or advance without being confined 
<A NAME="974"></A>or circumscribed either when they put out or put in. In any case he was 
<A NAME="975"></A>altogether opposed to their staying on where they were, and insisted on 
<A NAME="976"></A>removing at once, as quickly and with as little delay as possible; and 
<A NAME="977"></A>in this judgment Eurymedon agreed. Nicias however still objecting, a certain 
<A NAME="978"></A>diffidence and hesitation came over them, with a suspicion that Nicias 
<A NAME="979"></A>might have some further information to make him so positive.

<A NAME="980"></A><B>Chapter XXIII</B>

<A NAME="981"></A><BR><BR><B>Nineteenth Year of the War - Battles</B> <B>in the Great Harbour 
<A NAME="982"></A>- Retreat and</B> <B>Annihilation of the Athenian Army</B>
<A NAME="983"></A><BR><BR>While the Athenians lingered on in this way without moving from 
<A NAME="984"></A>where they were, Gylippus and Sicanus now arrived at Syracuse. Sicanus 
<A NAME="985"></A>had failed to gain Agrigentum, the party friendly to the Syracusans having 
<A NAME="986"></A>been driven out while he was still at Gela; but Gylippus was accompanied 
<A NAME="987"></A>not only by a large number of troops raised in Sicily, but by the heavy 
<A NAME="988"></A>infantry sent off in the spring from Peloponnese in the merchantmen, who 
<A NAME="989"></A>had arrived at Selinus from Libya. They had been carried to Libya by a 
<A NAME="990"></A>storm, and having obtained two galleys and pilots from the Cyrenians, on 
<A NAME="991"></A>their voyage alongshore had taken sides with the Euesperitae and had defeated 
<A NAME="992"></A>the Libyans who were besieging them, and from thence coasting on to Neapolis, 
<A NAME="993"></A>a Carthaginian mart, and the nearest point to Sicily, from which it is 
<A NAME="994"></A>only two days' and a night's voyage, there crossed over and came to Selinus. 
<A NAME="995"></A>Immediately upon their arrival the Syracusans prepared to attack the Athenians 
<A NAME="996"></A>again by land and sea at once. The Athenian generals seeing a fresh army 
<A NAME="997"></A>come to the aid of the enemy, and that their own circumstances, far from 
<A NAME="998"></A>improving, were becoming daily worse, and above all distressed by the sickness 
<A NAME="999"></A>of the soldiers, now began to repent of not having removed before; and 
<A NAME="1000"></A>Nicias no longer offering the same opposition, except by urging that there 
<A NAME="1001"></A>should be no open voting, they gave orders as secretly as possible for 
<A NAME="1002"></A>all to be prepared to sail out from the camp at a given signal. All was 
<A NAME="1003"></A>at last ready, and they were on the point of sailing away, when an eclipse 
<A NAME="1004"></A>of the moon, which was then at the full, took place. Most of the Athenians, 
<A NAME="1005"></A>deeply impressed by this occurrence, now urged the generals to wait; and 
<A NAME="1006"></A>Nicias, who was somewhat over-addicted to divination and practices of that 
<A NAME="1007"></A>kind, refused from that moment even to take the question of departure into 
<A NAME="1008"></A>consideration, until they had waited the thrice nine days prescribed by 
<A NAME="1009"></A>the soothsayers.
<A NAME="1010"></A><BR><BR>The besiegers were thus condemned to stay in the country; and the 
<A NAME="1011"></A>Syracusans, getting wind of what had happened, became more eager than ever 
<A NAME="1012"></A>to press the Athenians, who had now themselves acknowledged that they were 
<A NAME="1013"></A>no longer their superiors either by sea or by land, as otherwise they would 
<A NAME="1014"></A>never have planned to sail away. Besides which the Syracusans did not wish 
<A NAME="1015"></A>them to settle in any other part of Sicily, where they would be more difficult 
<A NAME="1016"></A>to deal with, but desired to force them to fight at sea as quickly as possible, 
<A NAME="1017"></A>in a position favourable to themselves. Accordingly they manned their ships 
<A NAME="1018"></A>and practised for as many days as they thought sufficient. When the moment 
<A NAME="1019"></A>arrived they assaulted on the first day the Athenian lines, and upon a 
<A NAME="1020"></A>small force of heavy infantry and horse sallying out against them by certain 
<A NAME="1021"></A>gates, cut off some of the former and routed and pursued them to the lines, 
<A NAME="1022"></A>where, as the entrance was narrow, the Athenians lost seventy horses and 
<A NAME="1023"></A>some few of the heavy infantry.
<A NAME="1024"></A><BR><BR>Drawing off their troops for this day, on the next the Syracusans 
<A NAME="1025"></A>went out with a fleet of seventy-six sail, and at the same time advanced 
<A NAME="1026"></A>with their land forces against the lines. The Athenians put out to meet 
<A NAME="1027"></A>them with eighty-six ships, came to close quarters, and engaged. The Syracusans 
<A NAME="1028"></A>and their allies first defeated the Athenian centre, and then caught Eurymedon, 
<A NAME="1029"></A>the commander of the right wing, who was sailing out from the line more 
<A NAME="1030"></A>towards the land in order to surround the enemy, in the hollow and recess 
<A NAME="1031"></A>of the harbour, and killed him and destroyed the ships accompanying him; 
<A NAME="1032"></A>after which they now chased the whole Athenian fleet before them and drove 
<A NAME="1033"></A>them ashore.
<A NAME="1034"></A><BR><BR>Gylippus seeing the enemy's fleet defeated and carried ashore beyond 
<A NAME="1035"></A>their stockades and camp, ran down to the breakwater with some of his troops, 
<A NAME="1036"></A>in order to cut off the men as they landed and make it easier for the Syracusans 
<A NAME="1037"></A>to tow off the vessels by the shore being friendly ground. The Tyrrhenians 
<A NAME="1038"></A>who guarded this point for the Athenians, seeing them come on in disorder, 
<A NAME="1039"></A>advanced out against them and attacked and routed their van, hurling it 
<A NAME="1040"></A>into the marsh of Lysimeleia. Afterwards the Syracusan and allied troops 
<A NAME="1041"></A>arrived in greater numbers, and the Athenians fearing for their ships came 
<A NAME="1042"></A>up also to the rescue and engaged them, and defeated and pursued them to 
<A NAME="1043"></A>some distance and killed a few of their heavy infantry. They succeeded 
<A NAME="1044"></A>in rescuing most of their ships and brought them down by their camp; eighteen 
<A NAME="1045"></A>however were taken by the Syracusans and their allies, and all the men 
<A NAME="1046"></A>killed. The rest the enemy tried to burn by means of an old merchantman 
<A NAME="1047"></A>which they filled with faggots and pine-wood, set on fire, and let drift 
<A NAME="1048"></A>down the wind which blew full on the Athenians. The Athenians, however, 
<A NAME="1049"></A>alarmed for their ships, contrived means for stopping it and putting it 
<A NAME="1050"></A>out, and checking the flames and the nearer approach of the merchantman, 
<A NAME="1051"></A>thus escaped the danger.
<A NAME="1052"></A><BR><BR>After this the Syracusans set up a trophy for the sea-fight and 
<A NAME="1053"></A>for the heavy infantry whom they had cut off up at the lines, where they 
<A NAME="1054"></A>took the horses; and the Athenians for the rout of the foot driven by the 
<A NAME="1055"></A>Tyrrhenians into the marsh, and for their own victory with the rest of 
<A NAME="1056"></A>the army.
<A NAME="1057"></A><BR><BR>The Syracusans had now gained a decisive victory at sea, where 
<A NAME="1058"></A>until now they had feared the reinforcement brought by Demosthenes, and 
<A NAME="1059"></A>deep, in consequence, was the despondency of the Athenians, and great their 
<A NAME="1060"></A>disappointment, and greater still their regret for having come on the expedition. 
<A NAME="1061"></A>These were the only cities that they had yet encountered, similar to their 
<A NAME="1062"></A>own in character, under democracies like themselves, which had ships and 
<A NAME="1063"></A>horses, and were of considerable magnitude. They had been unable to divide 
<A NAME="1064"></A>and bring them over by holding out the prospect of changes in their governments, 
<A NAME="1065"></A>or to crush them by their great superiority in force, but had failed in 
<A NAME="1066"></A>most of their attempts, and being already in perplexity, had now been defeated 
<A NAME="1067"></A>at sea, where defeat could never have been expected, and were thus plunged 
<A NAME="1068"></A>deeper in embarrassment than ever.
<A NAME="1069"></A><BR><BR>Meanwhile the Syracusans immediately began to sail freely along 
<A NAME="1070"></A>the harbour, and determined to close up its mouth, so that the Athenians 
<A NAME="1071"></A>might not be able to steal out in future, even if they wished. Indeed, 
<A NAME="1072"></A>the Syracusans no longer thought only of saving themselves, but also how 
<A NAME="1073"></A>to hinder the escape of the enemy; thinking, and thinking rightly, that 
<A NAME="1074"></A>they were now much the stronger,
