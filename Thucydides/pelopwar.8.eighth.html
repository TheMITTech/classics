<A NAME="10"></A><B>Chapter XXIV</B>
<A NAME="11"></A><BR><BR><B>Nineteenth and Twentieth Years of the War -</B> <B>Revolt of 
<A NAME="12"></A>Ionia - Intervention of</B> <B>Persia - The War in Ionia</B>
<A NAME="13"></A><BR><BR>When the news was brought to Athens, for a long while they disbelieved 
<A NAME="14"></A>even the most respectable of the soldiers who had themselves escaped from 
<A NAME="15"></A>the scene of action and clearly reported the matter, a destruction so complete 
<A NAME="16"></A>not being thought credible. When the conviction was forced upon them, they 
<A NAME="17"></A>were angry with the orators who had joined in promoting the expedition, 
<A NAME="18"></A>just as if they had not themselves voted it, and were enraged also with 
<A NAME="19"></A>the reciters of oracles and soothsayers, and all other omen-mongers of 
<A NAME="20"></A>the time who had encouraged them to hope that they should conquer Sicily. 
<A NAME="21"></A>Already distressed at all points and in all quarters, after what had now 
<A NAME="22"></A>happened, they were seized by a fear and consternation quite without example. 
<A NAME="23"></A>It was grievous enough for the state and for every man in his proper person 
<A NAME="24"></A>to lose so many heavy infantry, cavalry, and able-bodied troops, and to 
<A NAME="25"></A>see none left to replace them; but when they saw, also, that they had not 
<A NAME="26"></A>sufficient ships in their docks, or money in the treasury, or crews for 
<A NAME="27"></A>the ships, they began to despair of salvation. They thought that their 
<A NAME="28"></A>enemies in Sicily would immediately sail with their fleet against Piraeus, 
<A NAME="29"></A>inflamed by so signal a victory; while their adversaries at home, redoubling 
<A NAME="30"></A>all their preparations, would vigorously attack them by sea and land at 
<A NAME="31"></A>once, aided by their own revolted confederates. Nevertheless, with such 
<A NAME="32"></A>means as they had, it was determined to resist to the last, and to provide 
<A NAME="33"></A>timber and money, and to equip a fleet as they best could, to take steps 
<A NAME="34"></A>to secure their confederates and above all Euboea, to reform things in 
<A NAME="35"></A>the city upon a more economical footing, and to elect a board of elders 
<A NAME="36"></A>to advise upon the state of affairs as occasion should arise. In short, 
<A NAME="37"></A>as is the way of a democracy, in the panic of the moment they were ready 
<A NAME="38"></A>to be as prudent as possible.
<A NAME="39"></A><BR><BR>These resolves were at once carried into effect. Summer was now 
<A NAME="40"></A>over. The winter ensuing saw all Hellas stirring under the impression of 
<A NAME="41"></A>the great Athenian disaster in Sicily. Neutrals now felt that even if uninvited 
<A NAME="42"></A>they ought no longer to stand aloof from the war, but should volunteer 
<A NAME="43"></A>to march against the Athenians, who, as they severally reflected, would 
<A NAME="44"></A>probably have come against them if the Sicilian campaign had succeeded. 
<A NAME="45"></A>Besides, they considered that the war would now be short, and that it would 
<A NAME="46"></A>be creditable for them to take part in it. Meanwhile the allies of the 
<A NAME="47"></A>Lacedaemonians felt all more anxious than ever to see a speedy end to their 
<A NAME="48"></A>heavy labours. But above all, the subjects of the Athenians showed a readiness 
<A NAME="49"></A>to revolt even beyond their ability, judging the circumstances with passion, 
<A NAME="50"></A>and refusing even to hear of the Athenians being able to last out the coming 
<A NAME="51"></A>summer. Beyond all this, Lacedaemon was encouraged by the near prospect 
<A NAME="52"></A>of being joined in great force in the spring by her allies in Sicily, lately 
<A NAME="53"></A>forced by events to acquire their navy. With these reasons for confidence 
<A NAME="54"></A>in every quarter, the Lacedaemonians now resolved to throw themselves without 
<A NAME="55"></A>reserve into the war, considering that, once it was happily terminated, 
<A NAME="56"></A>they would be finally delivered from such dangers as that which would have 
<A NAME="57"></A>threatened them from Athens, if she had become mistress of Sicily, and 
<A NAME="58"></A>that the overthrow of the Athenians would leave them in quiet enjoyment 
<A NAME="59"></A>of the supremacy over all Hellas.
<A NAME="60"></A><BR><BR>Their king, Agis, accordingly set out at once during this winter 
<A NAME="61"></A>with some troops from Decelea, and levied from the allies contributions 
<A NAME="62"></A>for the fleet, and turning towards the Malian Gulf exacted a sum of money 
<A NAME="63"></A>from the Oetaeans by carrying off most of their cattle in reprisal for 
<A NAME="64"></A>their old hostility, and, in spite of the protests and opposition of the 
<A NAME="65"></A>Thessalians, forced the Achaeans of Phthiotis and the other subjects of 
<A NAME="66"></A>the Thessalians in those parts to give him money and hostages, and deposited 
<A NAME="67"></A>the hostages at Corinth, and tried to bring their countrymen into the confederacy. 
<A NAME="68"></A>The Lacedaemonians now issued a requisition to the cities for building 
<A NAME="69"></A>a hundred ships, fixing their own quota and that of the Boeotians at twenty-five 
<A NAME="70"></A>each; that of the Phocians and Locrians together at fifteen; that of the 
<A NAME="71"></A>Corinthians at fifteen; that of the Arcadians, Pellenians, and Sicyonians 
<A NAME="72"></A>together at ten; and that of the Megarians, Troezenians, Epidaurians, and 
<A NAME="73"></A>Hermionians together at ten also; and meanwhile made every other preparation 
<A NAME="74"></A>for commencing hostilities by the spring.
<A NAME="75"></A><BR><BR>In the meantime the Athenians were not idle. During this same winter, 
<A NAME="76"></A>as they had determined, they contributed timber and pushed on their ship-building, 
<A NAME="77"></A>and fortified Sunium to enable their corn-ships to round it in safety, 
<A NAME="78"></A>and evacuated the fort in Laconia which they had built on their way to 
<A NAME="79"></A>Sicily; while they also, for economy, cut down any other expenses that 
<A NAME="80"></A>seemed unnecessary, and above all kept a careful look-out against the revolt 
<A NAME="81"></A>of their confederates.
<A NAME="82"></A><BR><BR>While both parties were thus engaged, and were as intent upon preparing 
<A NAME="83"></A>for the war as they had been at the outset, the Euboeans first of all sent 
<A NAME="84"></A>envoys during this winter to Agis to treat of their revolting from Athens. 
<A NAME="85"></A>Agis accepted their proposals, and sent for Alcamenes, son of Sthenelaidas, 
<A NAME="86"></A>and Melanthus from Lacedaemon, to take the command in Euboea. These accordingly 
<A NAME="87"></A>arrived with some three hundred Neodamodes, and Agis began to arrange for 
<A NAME="88"></A>their crossing over. But in the meanwhile arrived some Lesbians, who also 
<A NAME="89"></A>wished to revolt; and these being supported by the Boeotians, Agis was 
<A NAME="90"></A>persuaded to defer acting in the matter of Euboea, and made arrangements 
<A NAME="91"></A>for the revolt of the Lesbians, giving them Alcamenes, who was to have 
<A NAME="92"></A>sailed to Euboea, as governor, and himself promising them ten ships, and 
<A NAME="93"></A>the Boeotians the same number. All this was done without instructions from 
<A NAME="94"></A>home, as Agis while at Decelea with the army that he commanded had power 
<A NAME="95"></A>to send troops to whatever quarter he pleased, and to levy men and money. 
<A NAME="96"></A>During this period, one might say, the allies obeyed him much more than 
<A NAME="97"></A>they did the Lacedaemonians in the city, as the force he had with him made 
<A NAME="98"></A>him feared at once wherever he went. While Agis was engaged with the Lesbians, 
<A NAME="99"></A>the Chians and Erythraeans, who were also ready to revolt, applied, not 
<A NAME="100"></A>to him but at Lacedaemon; where they arrived accompanied by an ambassador 
<A NAME="101"></A>from Tissaphernes, the commander of King Darius, son of Artaxerxes, in 
<A NAME="102"></A>the maritime districts, who invited the Peloponnesians to come over, and 
<A NAME="103"></A>promised to maintain their army. The King had lately called upon him for 
<A NAME="104"></A>the tribute from his government, for which he was in arrears, being unable 
<A NAME="105"></A>to raise it from the Hellenic towns by reason of the Athenians; and he 
<A NAME="106"></A>therefore calculated that by weakening the Athenians he should get the 
<A NAME="107"></A>tribute better paid, and should also draw the Lacedaemonians into alliance 
<A NAME="108"></A>with the King; and by this means, as the King had commanded him, take alive 
<A NAME="109"></A>or dead Amorges, the bastard son of Pissuthnes, who was in rebellion on 
<A NAME="110"></A>the coast of Caria.
<A NAME="111"></A><BR><BR>While the Chians and Tissaphernes thus joined to effect the same 
<A NAME="112"></A>object, about the same time Calligeitus, son of Laophon, a Megarian, and 
<A NAME="113"></A>Timagoras, son of Athenagoras, a Cyzicene, both of them exiles from their 
<A NAME="114"></A>country and living at the court of Pharnabazus, son of Pharnaces, arrived 
<A NAME="115"></A>at Lacedaemon upon a mission from Pharnabazus, to procure a fleet for the 
<A NAME="116"></A>Hellespont; by means of which, if possible, he might himself effect the 
<A NAME="117"></A>object of Tissaphernes' ambition and cause the cities in his government 
<A NAME="118"></A>to revolt from the Athenians, and so get the tribute, and by his own agency 
<A NAME="119"></A>obtain for the King the alliance of the Lacedaemonians.
<A NAME="120"></A><BR><BR>The emissaries of Pharnabazus and Tissaphernes treating apart, 
<A NAME="121"></A>a keen competition now ensued at Lacedaemon as to whether a fleet and army 
<A NAME="122"></A>should be sent first to Ionia and Chios, or to the Hellespont. The Lacedaemonians, 
<A NAME="123"></A>however, decidedly favoured the Chians and Tissaphernes, who were seconded 
<A NAME="124"></A>by Alcibiades, the family friend of Endius, one of the ephors for that 
<A NAME="125"></A>year. Indeed, this is how their house got its Laconic name, Alcibiades 
<A NAME="126"></A>being the family name of Endius. Nevertheless the Lacedaemonians first 
<A NAME="127"></A>sent to Chios Phrynis, one of the Perioeci, to see whether they had as 
<A NAME="128"></A>many ships as they said, and whether their city generally was as great 
<A NAME="129"></A>as was reported; and upon his bringing word that they had been told the 
<A NAME="130"></A>truth, immediately entered into alliance with the Chians and Erythraeans, 
<A NAME="131"></A>and voted to send them forty ships, there being already, according to the 
<A NAME="132"></A>statement of the Chians, not less than sixty in the island. At first the 
<A NAME="133"></A>Lacedaemonians meant to send ten of these forty themselves, with Melanchridas 
<A NAME="134"></A>their admiral; but afterwards, an earthquake having occurred, they sent 
<A NAME="135"></A>Chalcideus instead of Melanchridas, and instead of the ten ships equipped 
<A NAME="136"></A>only five in Laconia. And the winter ended, and with it ended also the 
<A NAME="137"></A>nineteenth year of this war of which Thucydides is the 
<A NAME="138"></A>historian.
<A NAME="139"></A><BR><BR>At the beginning of the next summer the Chians were urging that 
<A NAME="140"></A>the fleet should be sent off, being afraid that the Athenians, from whom 
<A NAME="141"></A>all these embassies were kept a secret, might find out what was going on, 
<A NAME="142"></A>and the Lacedaemonians at once sent three Spartans to Corinth to haul the 
<A NAME="143"></A>ships as quickly as possible across the Isthmus from the other sea to that 
<A NAME="144"></A>on the side of Athens, and to order them all to sail to Chios, those which 
<A NAME="145"></A>Agis was equipping for Lesbos not excepted. The number of ships from the 
<A NAME="146"></A>allied states was thirty-nine in all.
<A NAME="147"></A><BR><BR>Meanwhile Calligeitus and Timagoras did not join on behalf of Pharnabazus 
<A NAME="148"></A>in the expedition to Chios or give the money- twenty-five talents- which 
<A NAME="149"></A>they had brought with them to help in dispatching a force, but determined 
<A NAME="150"></A>to sail afterwards with another force by themselves. Agis, on the other 
<A NAME="151"></A>hand, seeing the Lacedaemonians bent upon going to Chios first, himself 
<A NAME="152"></A>came in to their views; and the allies assembled at Corinth and held a 
<A NAME="153"></A>council, in which they decided to sail first to Chios under the command 
<A NAME="154"></A>of Chalcideus, who was equipping the five vessels in Laconia, then to Lesbos, 
<A NAME="155"></A>under the command of Alcamenes, the same whom Agis had fixed upon, and 
<A NAME="156"></A>lastly to go to the Hellespont, where the command was given to Clearchus, 
<A NAME="157"></A>son of Ramphias. Meanwhile they would take only half the ships across the 
<A NAME="158"></A>Isthmus first, and let those sail off at once, in order that the Athenians 
<A NAME="159"></A>might attend less to the departing squadron than to those to be taken across 
<A NAME="160"></A>afterwards, as no care had been taken to keep this voyage secret through 
<A NAME="161"></A>contempt of the impotence of the Athenians, who had as yet no fleet of 
<A NAME="162"></A>any account upon the sea. Agreeably to this determination, twenty-one vessels 
<A NAME="163"></A>were at once conveyed across the Isthmus.
<A NAME="164"></A><BR><BR>They were now impatient to set sail, but the Corinthians were not 
<A NAME="165"></A>willing to accompany them until they had celebrated the Isthmian festival, 
<A NAME="166"></A>which fell at that time. Upon this Agis proposed to them to save their 
<A NAME="167"></A>scruples about breaking the Isthmian truce by taking the expedition upon 
<A NAME="168"></A>himself. The Corinthians not consenting to this, a delay ensued, during 
<A NAME="169"></A>which the Athenians conceived suspicions of what was preparing at Chios, 
<A NAME="170"></A>and sent Aristocrates, one of their generals, and charged them with the 
<A NAME="171"></A>fact, and, upon the denial of the Chians, ordered them to send with them 
<A NAME="172"></A>a contingent of ships, as faithful confederates. Seven were sent accordingly. 
<A NAME="173"></A>The reason of the dispatch of the ships lay in the fact that the mass of 
<A NAME="174"></A>the Chians were not privy to the negotiations, while the few who were in 
<A NAME="175"></A>the secret did not wish to break with the multitude until they had something 
<A NAME="176"></A>positive to lean upon, and no longer expected the Peloponnesians to arrive 
<A NAME="177"></A>by reason of their delay.
<A NAME="178"></A><BR><BR>In the meantime the Isthmian games took place, and the Athenians, 
<A NAME="179"></A>who had been also invited, went to attend them, and now seeing more clearly 
<A NAME="180"></A>into the designs of the Chians, as soon as they returned to Athens took 
<A NAME="181"></A>measures to prevent the fleet putting out from Cenchreae without their 
<A NAME="182"></A>knowledge. After the festival the Peloponnesians set sail with twenty-one 
<A NAME="183"></A>ships for Chios, under the command of Alcamenes. The Athenians first sailed 
<A NAME="184"></A>against them with an equal number, drawing off towards the open sea. The 
<A NAME="185"></A>enemy, however, turning back before he had followed them far, the Athenians 
<A NAME="186"></A>returned also, not trusting the seven Chian ships which formed part of 
<A NAME="187"></A>their number, and afterwards manned thirty-seven vessels in all and chased 
<A NAME="188"></A>him on his passage alongshore into Spiraeum, a desert Corinthian port on 
<A NAME="189"></A>the edge of the Epidaurian frontier. After losing one ship out at sea, 
<A NAME="190"></A>the Peloponnesians got the rest together and brought them to anchor. The 
<A NAME="191"></A>Athenians now attacked not only from the sea with their fleet, but also 
<A NAME="192"></A>disembarked upon the coast; and a melee ensued of the most confused and 
<A NAME="193"></A>violent kind, in which the Athenians disabled most of the enemy's vessels 
<A NAME="194"></A>and killed Alcamenes their commander, losing also a few of their own 
<A NAME="195"></A>men.
<A NAME="196"></A><BR><BR>After this they separated, and the Athenians, detaching a sufficient 
<A NAME="197"></A>number of ships to blockade those of the enemy, anchored with the rest 
<A NAME="198"></A>at the islet adjacent, upon whkh they proceeded to encamp, and sent to 
<A NAME="199"></A>Athens for reinforcements; the Peloponnesians having been joined on the 
<A NAME="200"></A>day after the battle by the Corinthians, who came to help the ships, and 
<A NAME="201"></A>by the other inhabitants in the vicinity not long afterwards. These saw 
<A NAME="202"></A>the difficulty of keeping guard in a desert place, and in their perplexity 
<A NAME="203"></A>at first thought of burning the ships, but finally resolved to haul them 
<A NAME="204"></A>up on shore and sit down and guard them with their land forces until a 
<A NAME="205"></A>convenient opportunity for escaping should present itself. Agis also, on 
<A NAME="206"></A>being informed of the disaster, sent them a Spartan of the name of Thermon. 
<A NAME="207"></A>The Lacedaemonians first received the news of the fleet having put out 
<A NAME="208"></A>from the Isthmus, Alcamenes having been ordered by the ephors to send off 
<A NAME="209"></A>a horseman when this took place, and immediately resolved to dispatch their 
<A NAME="210"></A>own five vessels under Chalcideus, and Alcibiades with him. But while they 
<A NAME="211"></A>were full of this resolution came the second news of the fleet having taken 
<A NAME="212"></A>refuge in Spiraeum; and disheartened at their first step in the Ionian 
<A NAME="213"></A>war proving a failure, they laid aside the idea of sending the ships from 
<A NAME="214"></A>their own country, and even wished to recall some that had already 
<A NAME="215"></A>sailed.
<A NAME="216"></A><BR><BR>Perceiving this, Alcibiades again persuaded Endius and the other 
<A NAME="217"></A>ephors to persevere in the expedition, saying that the voyage would be 
<A NAME="218"></A>made before the Chians heard of the fleet's misfortune, and that as soon 
<A NAME="219"></A>as he set foot in Ionia, he should, by assuring them of the weakness of 
<A NAME="220"></A>the Athenians and the zeal of Lacedaemon, have no difficulty in persuading 
<A NAME="221"></A>the cities to revolt, as they would readily believe his testimony. He also 
<A NAME="222"></A>represented to Endius himself in private that it would be glorious for 
<A NAME="223"></A>him to be the means of making Ionia revolt and the King become the ally 
<A NAME="224"></A>of Lacedaemon, instead of that honour being left to Agis (Agis, it must 
<A NAME="225"></A>be remembered, was the enemy of Alcibiades); and Endius and his colleagues 
<A NAME="226"></A>thus persuaded, he put to sea with the five ships and the Lacedaemonian 
<A NAME="227"></A>Chalcideus, and made all haste upon the voyage.
<A NAME="228"></A><BR><BR>About this time the sixteen Peloponnesian ships from Sicily, which 
<A NAME="229"></A>had served through the war with Gylippus, were caught on their return off 
<A NAME="230"></A>Leucadia and roughly handled by the twenty-seven Athenian vessels under 
<A NAME="231"></A>Hippocles, son of Menippus, on the lookout for the ships from Sicily. After 
<A NAME="232"></A>losing one of their number, the rest escaped from the Athenians and sailed 
<A NAME="233"></A>into Corinth.
<A NAME="234"></A><BR><BR>Meanwhile Chalcideus and Alcibiades seized all they met with on 
<A NAME="235"></A>their voyage, to prevent news of their coming, and let them go at Corycus, 
<A NAME="236"></A>the first point which they touched at in the continent. Here they were 
<A NAME="237"></A>visited by some of their Chian correspondents and, being urged by them 
<A NAME="238"></A>to sail up to the town without announcing their coming, arrived suddenly 
<A NAME="239"></A>before Chios. The many were amazed and confounded, while the few had so 
<A NAME="240"></A>arranged that the council should be sitting at the time; and after speeches 
<A NAME="241"></A>from Chalcideus and Alcibiades stating that many more ships were sailing 
<A NAME="242"></A>up, but saying nothing of the fleet being blockaded in Spiraeum, the Chians 
<A NAME="243"></A>revolted from the Athenians, and the Erythraeans immediately afterwards. 
<A NAME="244"></A>After this three vessels sailed over to Clazomenae, and made that city 
<A NAME="245"></A>revolt also; and the Clazomenians immediately crossed over to the mainland 
<A NAME="246"></A>and began to fortify Polichna, in order to retreat there, in case of necessity, 
<A NAME="247"></A>from the island where they dwelt.
<A NAME="248"></A><BR><BR>While the revolted places were all engaged in fortifying and preparing 
<A NAME="249"></A>for the war, news of Chios speedily reached Athens. The Athenians thought 
<A NAME="250"></A>the danger by which they were now menaced great and unmistakable, and that 
<A NAME="251"></A>the rest of their allies would not consent to keep quiet after the secession 
<A NAME="252"></A>of the greatest of their number. In the consternation of the moment they 
<A NAME="253"></A>at once took off the penalty attaching to whoever proposed or put to the 
<A NAME="254"></A>vote a proposal for using the thousand talents which they had jealously 
<A NAME="255"></A>avoided touching throughout the whole war, and voted to employ them to 
<A NAME="256"></A>man a large number of ships, and to send off at once under Strombichides, 
<A NAME="257"></A>son of Diotimus, the eight vessels, forming part of the blockading fleet 
<A NAME="258"></A>at Spiraeum, which had left the blockade and had returned after pursuing 
<A NAME="259"></A>and failing to overtake the vessels with Chalcideus. These were to be followed 
<A NAME="260"></A>shortly afterwards by twelve more under Thrasycles, also taken from the 
<A NAME="261"></A>blockade. They also recalled the seven Chian vessels, forming part of their 
<A NAME="262"></A>squadron blockading the fleet in Spiraeum, and giving the slaves on board 
<A NAME="263"></A>their liberty, put the freemen in confinement, and speedily manned and 
<A NAME="264"></A>sent out ten fresh ships to blockade the Peloponnesians in the place of 
<A NAME="265"></A>all those that had departed, and decided to man thirty more. Zeal was not 
<A NAME="266"></A>wanting, and no effort was spared to send relief to 
<A NAME="267"></A>Chios.
<A NAME="268"></A><BR><BR>In the meantime Strombichides with his eight ships arrived at Samos, 
<A NAME="269"></A>and, taking one Samian vessel, sailed to Teos and required them to remain 
<A NAME="270"></A>quiet. Chalcideus also set sail with twenty-three ships for Teos from Chios, 
<A NAME="271"></A>the land forces of the Clazomenians and Erythraeans moving alongshore to 
<A NAME="272"></A>support him. Informed of this in time, Strombichides put out from Teos 
<A NAME="273"></A>before their arrival, and while out at sea, seeing the number of the ships 
<A NAME="274"></A>from Chios, fled towards Samos, chased by the enemy. The Teians at first 
<A NAME="275"></A>would not receive the land forces, but upon the flight of the Athenians 
<A NAME="276"></A>took them into the town. There they waited for some time for Chalcideus 
<A NAME="277"></A>to return from the pursuit, and as time went on without his appearing, 
<A NAME="278"></A>began themselves to demolish the wall which the Athenians had built on 
<A NAME="279"></A>the land side of the city of the Teians, being assisted by a few of the 
<A NAME="280"></A>barbarians who had come up under the command of Stages, the lieutenant 
<A NAME="281"></A>of Tissaphernes.
<A NAME="282"></A><BR><BR>Meanwhile Chalcideus and Alcibiades, after chasing Strombichides 
<A NAME="283"></A>into Samos, armed the crews of the ships from Peloponnese and left them 
<A NAME="284"></A>at Chios, and filling their places with substitutes from Chios and manning 
<A NAME="285"></A>twenty others, sailed off to effect the revolt of Miletus. The wish of 
<A NAME="286"></A>Alcibiades, who had friends among the leading men of the Milesians, was 
<A NAME="287"></A>to bring over the town before the arrival of the ships from Peloponnese, 
<A NAME="288"></A>and thus, by causing the revolt of as many cities as possible with the 
<A NAME="289"></A>help of the Chian power and of Chalcideus, to secure the honour for the 
<A NAME="290"></A>Chians and himself and Chalcideus, and, as he had promised, for Endius 
<A NAME="291"></A>who had sent them out. Not discovered until their voyage was nearly completed, 
<A NAME="292"></A>they arrived a little before Strombichides and Thrasycles (who had just 
<A NAME="293"></A>come with twelve ships from Athens, and had joined Strombichides in pursuing 
<A NAME="294"></A>them), and occasioned the revolt of Miletus. The Athenians sailing up close 
<A NAME="295"></A>on their heels with nineteen ships found Miletus closed against them, and 
<A NAME="296"></A>took up their station at the adjacent island of Lade. The first alliance 
<A NAME="297"></A>between the King and the Lacedaemonians was now concluded immediately upon 
<A NAME="298"></A>the revolt of the Milesians, by Tissaphernes and Chalcideus, and was as 
<A NAME="299"></A>follows:
<A NAME="300"></A><BR><BR>The Lacedaemonians and their allies made a treaty with the King 
<A NAME="301"></A>and Tissaphernes upon the terms following:
<A NAME="302"></A><BR><BR><B>1.</B> Whatever country or cities the King has, or the King's 
<A NAME="303"></A>ancestors had, shall be the king's: and whatever came in to the Athenians 
<A NAME="304"></A>from these cities, either money or any other thing, the King and the Lacedaemonians 
<A NAME="305"></A>and their allies shall jointly hinder the Athenians from receiving either 
<A NAME="306"></A>money or any other thing.
<A NAME="307"></A><BR><BR><B>2.</B> The war with the Athenians shall be carried on jointly 
<A NAME="308"></A>by the King and by the Lacedaemonians and their allies: and it shall not 
<A NAME="309"></A>be lawful to make peace with the Athenians except both agree, the King 
<A NAME="310"></A>on his side and the Lacedaemonians and their allies on 
<A NAME="311"></A>theirs.
<A NAME="312"></A><BR><BR><B>3.</B> If any revolt from the King, they shall be the enemies 
<A NAME="313"></A>of the Lacedaemonians and their allies. And if any revolt from the Lacedaemonians 
<A NAME="314"></A>and their allies, they shall be the enemies of the King in like 
<A NAME="315"></A>manner.
<A NAME="316"></A><BR><BR>This was the alliance. After this the Chians immediately manned 
<A NAME="317"></A>ten more vessels and sailed for Anaia, in order to gain intelligence of 
<A NAME="318"></A>those in Miletus, and also to make the cities revolt. A message, however, 
<A NAME="319"></A>reaching them from Chalcideus to tell them to go back again, and that Amorges 
<A NAME="320"></A>was at hand with an army by land, they sailed to the temple of Zeus, and 
<A NAME="321"></A>there sighting ten more ships sailing up with which Diomedon had started 
<A NAME="322"></A>from Athens after Thrasycles, fled, one ship to Ephesus, the rest to Teos. 
<A NAME="323"></A>The Athenians took four of their ships empty, the men finding time to escape 
<A NAME="324"></A>ashore; the rest took refuge in the city of the Teians; after which the 
<A NAME="325"></A>Athenians sailed off to Samos, while the Chians put to sea with their remaining 
<A NAME="326"></A>vessels, accompanied by the land forces, and caused Lebedos to revolt, 
<A NAME="327"></A>and after it Erae. After this they both returned home, the fleet and the 
<A NAME="328"></A>army.
<A NAME="329"></A><BR><BR>About the same time the twenty ships of the Peloponnesians in Spiraeum, 
<A NAME="330"></A>which we left chased to land and blockaded by an equal number of Athenians, 
<A NAME="331"></A>suddenly sallied out and defeated the blockading squadron, took four of 
<A NAME="332"></A>their ships, and, sailing back to Cenchreae, prepared again for the voyage 
<A NAME="333"></A>to Chios and Ionia. Here they were joined by Astyochus as high admiral 
<A NAME="334"></A>from Lacedaemon, henceforth invested with the supreme command at sea. The 
<A NAME="335"></A>land forces now withdrawing from Teos, Tissaphernes repaired thither in 
<A NAME="336"></A>person with an army and completed the demolition of anything that was left 
<A NAME="337"></A>of the wall, and so departed. Not long after his departure Diomedon arrived 
<A NAME="338"></A>with ten Athenian ships, and, having made a convention by which the Teians 
<A NAME="339"></A>admitted him as they had the enemy, coasted along to Erae, and, failing 
<A NAME="340"></A>in an attempt upon the town, sailed back again.
<A NAME="341"></A><BR><BR>About this time took place the rising of the commons at Samos against 
<A NAME="342"></A>the upper classes, in concert with some Athenians, who were there in three 
<A NAME="343"></A>vessels. The Samian commons put to death some two hundred in all of the 
<A NAME="344"></A>upper classes, and banished four hundred more, and themselves took their 
<A NAME="345"></A>land and houses; after which the Athenians decreed their independence, 
<A NAME="346"></A>being now sure of their fidelity, and the commons henceforth governed the 
<A NAME="347"></A>city, excluding the landholders from all share in affairs, and forbidding 
<A NAME="348"></A>any of the commons to give his daughter in marriage to them or to take 
<A NAME="349"></A>a wife from them in future.
<A NAME="350"></A><BR><BR>After this, during the same summer, the Chians, whose zeal continued 
<A NAME="351"></A>as active as ever, and who even without the Peloponnesians found themselves 
<A NAME="352"></A>in sufficient force to effect the revolt of the cities and also wished 
<A NAME="353"></A>to have as many companions in peril as possible, made an expedition with 
<A NAME="354"></A>thirteen ships of their own to Lesbos; the instructions from Lacedaemon 
<A NAME="355"></A>being to go to that island next, and from thence to the Hellespont. Meanwhile 
<A NAME="356"></A>the land forces of the Peloponnesians who were with the Chians and of the 
<A NAME="357"></A>allies on the spot, moved alongshore for Clazomenae and Cuma, under the 
<A NAME="358"></A>command of Eualas, a Spartan; while the fleet under Diniadas, one of the 
<A NAME="359"></A>Perioeci, first sailed up to Methymna and caused it to revolt, and, leaving 
<A NAME="360"></A>four ships there, with the rest procured the revolt of 
<A NAME="361"></A>Mitylene.
<A NAME="362"></A><BR><BR>In the meantime Astyochus, the Lacedaemonian admiral, set sail 
<A NAME="363"></A>from Cenchreae with four ships, as he had intended, and arrived at Chios. 
<A NAME="364"></A>On the third day after his arrival, the Athenian ships, twenty-five in 
<A NAME="365"></A>number, sailed to Lesbos under Diomedon and Leon, who had lately arrived 
<A NAME="366"></A>with a reinforcement of ten ships from Athens. Late in the same day Astyochus 
<A NAME="367"></A>put to sea, and taking one Chian vessel with him sailed to Lesbos to render 
<A NAME="368"></A>what assistance he could. Arrived at Pyrrha, and from thence the next day 
<A NAME="369"></A>at Eresus, he there learned that Mitylene had been taken, almost without 
<A NAME="370"></A>a blow, by the Athenians, who had sailed up and unexpectedly put into the 
<A NAME="371"></A>harbour, had beaten the Chian ships, and landing and defeating the troops 
<A NAME="372"></A>opposed to them had become masters of the city. Informed of this by the 
<A NAME="373"></A>Eresians and the Chian ships, which had been left with Eubulus at Methymna, 
<A NAME="374"></A>and had fled upon the capture of Mitylene, and three of which he now fell 
<A NAME="375"></A>in with, one having been taken by the Athenians, Astyochus did not go on 
<A NAME="376"></A>to Mitylene, but raised and armed Eresus, and, sending the heavy infantry 
<A NAME="377"></A>from his own ships by land under Eteonicus to Antissa and Methymna, himself 
<A NAME="378"></A>proceeded alongshore thither with the ships which he had with him and with 
<A NAME="379"></A>the three Chians, in the hope that the Methymnians upon seeing them would 
<A NAME="380"></A>be encouraged to persevere in their revolt. As, however, everything went 
<A NAME="381"></A>against him in Lesbos, he took up his own force and sailed back to Chios; 
<A NAME="382"></A>the land forces on board, which were to have gone to the Hellespont, being 
<A NAME="383"></A>also conveyed back to their different cities. After this six of the allied 
<A NAME="384"></A>Peloponnesian ships at Cenchreae joined the forces at Chios. The Athenians, 
<A NAME="385"></A>after restoring matters to their old state in Lesbos, set sail from thence 
<A NAME="386"></A>and took Polichna, the place that the Clazomenians were fortifying on the 
<A NAME="387"></A>continent, and carried the inhabitants back to their town upon the island, 
<A NAME="388"></A>except the authors of the revolt, who withdrew to Daphnus; and thus Clazomenae 
<A NAME="389"></A>became once more Athenian.
<A NAME="390"></A><BR><BR>The same summer the Athenians in the twenty ships at Lade, blockading 
<A NAME="391"></A>Miletus, made a descent at Panormus in the Milesian territory, and killed 
<A NAME="392"></A>Chalcideus the Lacedaemonian commander, who had come with a few men against 
<A NAME="393"></A>them, and the third day after sailed over and set up a trophy, which, as 
<A NAME="394"></A>they were not masters of the country, was however pulled down by the Milesians. 
<A NAME="395"></A>Meanwhile Leon and Diomedon with the Athenian fleet from Lesbos issuing 
<A NAME="396"></A>from the Oenussae, the isles off Chios, and from their forts of Sidussa 
<A NAME="397"></A>and Pteleum in the Erythraeid, and from Lesbos, carried on the war against 
<A NAME="398"></A>the Chians from the ships, having on board heavy infantry from the rolls 
<A NAME="399"></A>pressed to serve as marines. Landing in Cardamyle and in Bolissus they 
<A NAME="400"></A>defeated with heavy loss the Chians that took the field against them and, 
<A NAME="401"></A>laying desolate the places in that neighbourhood, defeated the Chians again 
<A NAME="402"></A>in another battle at Phanae, and in a third at Leuconium. After this the 
<A NAME="403"></A>Chians ceased to meet them in the field, while the Athenians devastated 
<A NAME="404"></A>the country, which was beautifully stocked and had remained uninjured ever 
<A NAME="405"></A>since the Median wars. Indeed, after the Lacedaemonians, the Chians are 
<A NAME="406"></A>the only people that I have known who knew how to be wise in prosperity, 
<A NAME="407"></A>and who ordered their city the more securely the greater it grew. Nor was 
<A NAME="408"></A>this revolt, in which they might seem to have erred on the side of rashness, 
<A NAME="409"></A>ventured upon until they had numerous and gallant allies to share the danger 
<A NAME="410"></A>with them, and until they perceived the Athenians after the Sicilian disaster 
<A NAME="411"></A>themselves no longer denying the thoroughly desperate state of their affairs. 
<A NAME="412"></A>And if they were thrown out by one of the surprises which upset human calculations, 
<A NAME="413"></A>they found out their mistake in company with many others who believed, 
<A NAME="414"></A>like them, in the speedy collapse of the Athenian power. While they were 
<A NAME="415"></A>thus blockaded from the sea and plundered by land, some of the citizens 
<A NAME="416"></A>undertook to bring the city over to the Athenians. Apprised of this the 
<A NAME="417"></A>authorities took no action themselves, but brought Astyochus, the admiral, 
<A NAME="418"></A>from Erythrae, with four ships that he had with him, and considered how 
<A NAME="419"></A>they could most quietly, either by taking hostages or by some other means, 
<A NAME="420"></A>put an end to the conspiracy.
<A NAME="421"></A><BR><BR>While the Chians were thus engaged, a thousand Athenian heavy infantry 
<A NAME="422"></A>and fifteen hundred Argives (five hundred of whom were light troops furnished 
<A NAME="423"></A>with armour by the Athenians), and one thousand of the allies, towards 
<A NAME="424"></A>the close of the same summer sailed from Athens in forty-eight ships, some 
<A NAME="425"></A>of which were transports, under the command of Phrynichus, Onomacles, and 
<A NAME="426"></A>Scironides, and putting into Samos crossed over and encamped at Miletus. 
<A NAME="427"></A>Upon this the Milesians came out to the number of eight hundred heavy infantry, 
<A NAME="428"></A>with the Peloponnesians who had come with Chalcideus, and some foreign 
<A NAME="429"></A>mercenaries of Tissaphernes, Tissaphernes himself and his cavalry, and 
<A NAME="430"></A>engaged the Athenians and their allies. While the Argives rushed forward 
<A NAME="431"></A>on their own wing with the careless disdain of men advancing against Ionians 
<A NAME="432"></A>who would never stand their charge, and were defeated by the Milesians 
<A NAME="433"></A>with a loss little short of three hundred men, the Athenians first defeated 
<A NAME="434"></A>the Peloponnesians, and driving before them the barbarians and the ruck 
<A NAME="435"></A>of the army, without engaging the Milesians, who after the rout of the 
<A NAME="436"></A>Argives retreated into the town upon seeing their comrades worsted, crowned 
<A NAME="437"></A>their victory by grounding their arms under the very walls of Miletus. 
<A NAME="438"></A>Thus, in this battle, the Ionians on both sides overcame the Dorians, the 
<A NAME="439"></A>Athenians defeating the Peloponnesians opposed to them, and the Milesians 
<A NAME="440"></A>the Argives. After setting up a trophy, the Athenians prepared to draw 
<A NAME="441"></A>a wall round the place, which stood upon an isthmus; thinking that, if 
<A NAME="442"></A>they could gain Miletus, the other towns also would easily come over to 
<A NAME="443"></A>them.
<A NAME="444"></A><BR><BR>Meanwhile about dusk tidings reached them that the fifty-five ships 
<A NAME="445"></A>from Peloponnese and Sicily might be instantly expected. Of these the Siceliots, 
<A NAME="446"></A>urged principally by the Syracusan Hermocrates to join in giving the finishing 
<A NAME="447"></A>blow to the power of Athens, furnished twenty-two- twenty from Syracuse, 
<A NAME="448"></A>and two from Silenus; and the ships that we left preparing in Peloponnese 
<A NAME="449"></A>being now ready, both squadrons had been entrusted to Therimenes, a Lacedaemonian, 
<A NAME="450"></A>to take to Astyochus, the admiral. They now put in first at Leros the island 
<A NAME="451"></A>off Miletus, and from thence, discovering that the Athenians were before 
<A NAME="452"></A>the town, sailed into the Iasic Gulf, in order to learn how matters stood 
<A NAME="453"></A>at Miletus. Meanwhile Alcibiades came on horseback to Teichiussa in the 
<A NAME="454"></A>Milesian territory, the point of the gulf at which they had put in for 
<A NAME="455"></A>the night, and told them of the battle in which he had fought in person 
<A NAME="456"></A>by the side of the Milesians and Tissaphernes, and advised them, if they 
<A NAME="457"></A>did not wish to sacrifice Ionia and their cause, to fly to the relief of 
<A NAME="458"></A>Miletus and hinder its investment.
<A NAME="459"></A><BR><BR>Accordingly they resolved to relieve it the next morning. Meanwhile 
<A NAME="460"></A>Phrynichus, the Athenian commander, had received precise intelligence of 
<A NAME="461"></A>the fleet from Leros, and when his colleagues expressed a wish to keep 
<A NAME="462"></A>the sea and fight it out, flatly refused either to stay himself or to let 
<A NAME="463"></A>them or any one else do so if he could help it. Where they could hereafter 
<A NAME="464"></A>contend, after full and undisturbed preparation, with an exact knowledge 
<A NAME="465"></A>of the number of the enemy's fleet and of the force which they could oppose 
<A NAME="466"></A>to him, he would never allow the reproach of disgrace to drive him into 
<A NAME="467"></A>a risk that was unreasonable. It was no disgrace for an Athenian fleet 
<A NAME="468"></A>to retreat when it suited them: put it as they would, it would be more 
<A NAME="469"></A>disgraceful to be beaten, and to expose the city not only to disgrace, 
<A NAME="470"></A>but to the most serious danger. After its late misfortunes it could hardly 
<A NAME="471"></A>be justified in voluntarily taking the offensive even with the strongest 
<A NAME="472"></A>force, except in a case of absolute necessity: much less then without compulsion 
<A NAME="473"></A>could it rush upon peril of its own seeking. He told them to take up their 
<A NAME="474"></A>wounded as quickly as they could and the troops and stores which they had 
<A NAME="475"></A>brought with them, and leaving behind what they had taken from the enemy's 
<A NAME="476"></A>country, in order to lighten the ships, to sail off to Samos, and there 
<A NAME="477"></A>concentrating all their ships to attack as opportunity served. As he spoke 
<A NAME="478"></A>so he acted; and thus not now more than afterwards, nor in this alone but 
<A NAME="479"></A>in all that he had to do with, did Phrynichus show himself a man of sense. 
<A NAME="480"></A>In this way that very evening the Athenians broke up from before Miletus, 
<A NAME="481"></A>leaving their victory unfinished, and the Argives, mortified at their disaster, 
<A NAME="482"></A>promptly sailed off home from Samos.
<A NAME="483"></A><BR><BR>As soon as it was morning the Peloponnesians weighed from Teichiussa 
<A NAME="484"></A>and put into Miletus after the departure of the Athenians; they stayed 
<A NAME="485"></A>one day, and on the next took with them the Chian vessels originally chased 
<A NAME="486"></A>into port with Chalcideus, and resolved to sail back for the tackle which 
<A NAME="487"></A>they had put on shore at Teichiussa. Upon their arrival Tissaphernes came 
<A NAME="488"></A>to them with his land forces and induced them to sail to Iasus, which was 
<A NAME="489"></A>held by his enemy Amorges. Accordingly they suddenly attacked and took 
<A NAME="490"></A>Iasus, whose inhabitants never imagined that the ships could be other than 
<A NAME="491"></A>Athenian. The Syracusans distinguished themselves most in the action. Amorges, 
<A NAME="492"></A>a bastard of Pissuthnes and a rebel from the King, was taken alive and 
<A NAME="493"></A>handed over to Tissaphernes, to carry to the King, if he chose, according 
<A NAME="494"></A>to his orders: Iasus was sacked by the army, who found a very great booty 
<A NAME="495"></A>there, the place being wealthy from ancient date. The mercenaries serving 
<A NAME="496"></A>with Amorges the Peloponnesians received and enrolled in their army without 
<A NAME="497"></A>doing them any harm, since most of them came from Peloponnese, and handed 
<A NAME="498"></A>over the town to Tissaphernes with all the captives, bond or free, at the 
<A NAME="499"></A>stipulated price of one Doric stater a head; after which they returned 
<A NAME="500"></A>to Miletus. Pedaritus, son of Leon, who had been sent by the Lacedaemonians 
<A NAME="501"></A>to take the command at Chios, they dispatched by land as far as Erythrae 
<A NAME="502"></A>with the mercenaries taken from Amorges; appointing Philip to remain as 
<A NAME="503"></A>governor of Miletus.
<A NAME="504"></A><BR><BR>Summer was now over. The winter following, Tissaphernes put Iasus 
<A NAME="505"></A>in a state of defence, and passing on to Miletus distributed a month's 
<A NAME="506"></A>pay to all the ships as he had promised at Lacedaemon, at the rate of an 
<A NAME="507"></A>Attic drachma a day for each man. In future, however, he was resolved not 
<A NAME="508"></A>to give more than three obols, until he had consulted the King; when if 
<A NAME="509"></A>the King should so order he would give, he said, the full drachma. However, 
<A NAME="510"></A>upon the protest of the Syracusan general Hermocrates (for as Therimenes 
<A NAME="511"></A>was not admiral, but only accompanied them in order to hand over the ships 
<A NAME="512"></A>to Astyochus, he made little difficulty about the pay), it was agreed that 
<A NAME="513"></A>the amount of five ships' pay should be given over and above the three 
<A NAME="514"></A>obols a day for each man; Tissaphernes paying thirty talents a month for 
<A NAME="515"></A>fifty-five ships, and to the rest, for as many ships as they had beyond 
<A NAME="516"></A>that number, at the same rate.
<A NAME="517"></A><BR><BR>The same winter the Athenians in Samos, having been joined by thirty-five 
<A NAME="518"></A>more vessels from home under Charminus, Strombichides, and Euctemon, called 
<A NAME="519"></A>in their squadron at Chios and all the rest, intending to blockade Miletus 
<A NAME="520"></A>with their navy, and to send a fleet and an army against Chios; drawing 
<A NAME="521"></A>lots for the respective services. This intention they carried into effect; 
<A NAME="522"></A>Strombichides, Onamacles, and Euctemon sailing against Chios, which fell 
<A NAME="523"></A>to their lot, with thirty ships and a part of the thousand heavy infantry, 
<A NAME="524"></A>who had been to Miletus, in transports; while the rest remained masters 
<A NAME="525"></A>of the sea with seventy-four ships at Samos, and advanced upon 
<A NAME="526"></A>Miletus.
<A NAME="527"></A><BR><BR>Meanwhile Astyochus, whom we left at Chios collecting the hostages 
<A NAME="528"></A>required in consequence of the conspiracy, stopped upon learning that the 
<A NAME="529"></A>fleet with Therimenes had arrived, and that the affairs of the league were 
<A NAME="530"></A>in a more flourishing condition, and putting out to sea with ten Peloponnesian 
<A NAME="531"></A>and as many Chian vessels, after a futile attack upon Pteleum, coasted 
<A NAME="532"></A>on to Clazomenae, and ordered the Athenian party to remove inland to Daphnus, 
<A NAME="533"></A>and to join the Peloponnesians, an order in which also joined Tamos the 
<A NAME="534"></A>king's lieutenant in Ionia. This order being disregarded, Astyochus made 
<A NAME="535"></A>an attack upon the town, which was unwalled, and having failed to take 
<A NAME="536"></A>it was himself carried off by a strong gale to Phocaea and Cuma, while 
<A NAME="537"></A>the rest of the ships put in at the islands adjacent to Clazomenae- Marathussa, 
<A NAME="538"></A>Pele, and Drymussa. Here they were detained eight days by the winds, and, 
<A NAME="539"></A>plundering and consuming all the property of the Clazomenians there deposited, 
<A NAME="540"></A>put the rest on shipboard and sailed off to Phocaea and Cuma to join 
<A NAME="541"></A>Astyochus.
<A NAME="542"></A><BR><BR>While he was there, envoys arrived from the Lesbians who wished 
<A NAME="543"></A>to revolt again. With Astyochus they were successful; but the Corinthians 
<A NAME="544"></A>and the other allies being averse to it by reason of their former failure, 
<A NAME="545"></A>he weighed anchor and set sail for Chios, where they eventually arrived 
<A NAME="546"></A>from different quarters, the fleet having been scattered by a storm. After 
<A NAME="547"></A>this Pedaritus, whom we left marching along the coast from Miletus, arrived 
<A NAME="548"></A>at Erythrae, and thence crossed over with his army to Chios, where he found 
<A NAME="549"></A>also about five hundred soldiers who had been left there by Chalcideus 
<A NAME="550"></A>from the five ships with their arms. Meanwhile some Lesbians making offers 
<A NAME="551"></A>to revolt, Astyochus urged upon Pedaritus and the Chians that they ought 
<A NAME="552"></A>to go with their ships and effect the revolt of Lesbos, and so increase 
<A NAME="553"></A>the number of their allies, or, if not successful, at all events harm the 
<A NAME="554"></A>Athenians. The Chians, however, turned a deaf ear to this, and Pedaritus 
<A NAME="555"></A>flatly refused to give up to him the Chian vessels.
<A NAME="556"></A><BR><BR>Upon this Astyochus took five Corinthian and one Megarian vessel, 
<A NAME="557"></A>with another from Hermione, and the ships which had come with him from 
<A NAME="558"></A>Laconia, and set sail for Miletus to assume his command as admiral; after 
<A NAME="559"></A>telling the Chians with many threats that he would certainly not come and 
<A NAME="560"></A>help them if they should be in need. At Corycus in the Erythraeid he brought 
<A NAME="561"></A>to for the night; the Athenian armament sailing from Samos against Chios 
<A NAME="562"></A>being only separated from him by a hill, upon the other side of which it 
<A NAME="563"></A>brought to; so that neither perceived the other. But a letter arriving 
<A NAME="564"></A>in the night from Pedaritus to say that some liberated Erythraean prisoners 
<A NAME="565"></A>had come from Samos to betray Erythrae, Astyochus at once put back to Erythrae, 
<A NAME="566"></A>and so just escaped falling in with the Athenians. Here Pedaritus sailed 
<A NAME="567"></A>over to join him; and after inquiry into the pretended treachery, finding 
<A NAME="568"></A>that the whole story had been made up to procure the escape of the men 
<A NAME="569"></A>from Samos, they acquitted them of the charge, and sailed away, Pedaritus 
<A NAME="570"></A>to Chios and Astyochus to Miletus as he had intended.
<A NAME="571"></A><BR><BR>Meanwhile the Athenian armament sailing round Corycus fell in with 
<A NAME="572"></A>three Chian men-of-war off Arginus, and gave immediate chase. A great storm 
<A NAME="573"></A>coming on, the Chians with difficulty took refuge in the harbour; the three 
<A NAME="574"></A>Athenian vessels most forward in the pursuit being wrecked and thrown up 
<A NAME="575"></A>near the city of Chios, and the crews slain or taken prisoners. The rest 
<A NAME="576"></A>of the Athenian fleet took refuge in the harbour called Phoenicus, under 
<A NAME="577"></A>Mount Mimas, and from thence afterwards put into Lesbos and prepared for 
<A NAME="578"></A>the work of fortification.
<A NAME="579"></A><BR><BR>The same winter the Lacedaemonian Hippocrates sailed out from Peloponnese 
<A NAME="580"></A>with ten Thurian ships under the command of Dorieus, son of Diagoras, and 
<A NAME="581"></A>two colleagues, one Laconian and one Syracusan vessel, and arrived at Cnidus, 
<A NAME="582"></A>which had already revolted at the instigation of Tissaphernes. When their 
<A NAME="583"></A>arrival was known at Miletus, orders came to them to leave half their squadron 
<A NAME="584"></A>to guard Cnidus, and with the rest to cruise round Triopium and seize all 
<A NAME="585"></A>the merchantmen arriving from Egypt. Triopium is a promontory of Cnidus 
<A NAME="586"></A>and sacred to Apollo. This coming to the knowledge of the Athenians, they 
<A NAME="587"></A>sailed from Samos and captured the six ships on the watch at Triopium, 
<A NAME="588"></A>the crews escaping out of them. After this the Athenians sailed into Cnidus 
<A NAME="589"></A>and made an assault upon the town, which was unfortified, and all but took 
<A NAME="590"></A>it; and the next day assaulted it again, but with less effect, as the inhabitants 
<A NAME="591"></A>had improved their defences during the night, and had been reinforced by 
<A NAME="592"></A>the crews escaped from the ships at Triopium. The Athenians now withdrew, 
<A NAME="593"></A>and after plundering the Cnidian territory sailed back to 
<A NAME="594"></A>Samos.
<A NAME="595"></A><BR><BR>About the same time Astyochus came to the fleet at Miletus. The 
<A NAME="596"></A>Peloponnesian camp was still plentifully supplied, being in receipt of 
<A NAME="597"></A>sufficient pay, and the soldiers having still in hand the large booty taken 
<A NAME="598"></A>at Iasus. The Milesians also showed great ardour for the war. Nevertheless 
<A NAME="599"></A>the Peloponnesians thought the first convention with Tissaphernes, made 
<A NAME="600"></A>with Chalcideus, defective, and more advantageous to him than to them, 
<A NAME="601"></A>and consequently while Therimenes was still there concluded another, which 
<A NAME="602"></A>was as follows:
<A NAME="603"></A><BR><BR>The convention of the Lacedaemonians and the allies with King Darius 
<A NAME="604"></A>and the sons of the King, and with Tissaphernes for a treaty and friendship, 
<A NAME="605"></A>as follows:
<A NAME="606"></A><BR><BR><B>1.</B> Neither the Lacedaemonians nor the allies of the Lacedaemonians 
<A NAME="607"></A>shall make war against or otherwise injure any country or cities that belong 
<A NAME="608"></A>to King Darius or did belong to his father or to his ancestors; neither 
<A NAME="609"></A>shall the Lacedaemonians nor the allies of the Lacedaemonians exact tribute 
<A NAME="610"></A>from such cities. Neither shall King Darius nor any of the subjects of 
<A NAME="611"></A>the King make war against or otherwise injure the Lacedaemonians or their 
<A NAME="612"></A>allies.
<A NAME="613"></A><BR><BR><B>2.</B> If the Lacedaemonians or their allies should require 
<A NAME="614"></A>any assistance from the King, or the King from the Lacedaemonians or their 
<A NAME="615"></A>allies, whatever they both agree upon they shall be right in 
<A NAME="616"></A>doing.
<A NAME="617"></A><BR><BR><B>3.</B> Both shall carry on jointly the war against the Athenians 
<A NAME="618"></A>and their allies: and if they make peace, both shall do so 
<A NAME="619"></A>jointly.
<A NAME="620"></A><BR><BR><B>4.</B> The expense of all troops in the King's country, sent 
<A NAME="621"></A>for by the King, shall be borne by the King.
<A NAME="622"></A><BR><BR><B>5.</B> If any of the states comprised in this convention with 
<A NAME="623"></A>the King attack the King's country, the rest shall stop them and aid the 
<A NAME="624"></A>King to the best of their power. And if any in the King's country or in 
<A NAME="625"></A>the countries under the King's rule attack the country of the Lacedaemonians 
<A NAME="626"></A>or their allies, the King shall stop it and help them to the best of his 
<A NAME="627"></A>power.
<A NAME="628"></A><BR><BR>After this convention Therimenes handed over the fleet to Astyochus, 
<A NAME="629"></A>sailed off in a small boat, and was lost. The Athenian armament had now 
<A NAME="630"></A>crossed over from Lesbos to Chios, and being master by sea and land began 
<A NAME="631"></A>to fortify Delphinium, a place naturally strong on the land side, provided 
<A NAME="632"></A>with more than one harbour, and also not far from the city of Chios. Meanwhile 
<A NAME="633"></A>the Chians remained inactive. Already defeated in so many battles, they 
<A NAME="634"></A>were now also at discord among themselves; the execution of the party of 
<A NAME="635"></A>Tydeus, son of Ion, by Pedaritus upon the charge of Atticism, followed 
<A NAME="636"></A>by the forcible imposition of an oligarchy upon the rest of the city, having 
<A NAME="637"></A>made them suspicious of one another; and they therefore thought neither 
<A NAME="638"></A>themselves not the mercenaries under Pedaritus a match for the enemy. They 
<A NAME="639"></A>sent, however, to Miletus to beg Astyochus to assist them, which he refused 
<A NAME="640"></A>to do, and was accordingly denounced at Lacedaemon by Pedaritus as a traitor. 
<A NAME="641"></A>Such was the state of the Athenian affairs at Chios; while their fleet 
<A NAME="642"></A>at Samos kept sailing out against the enemy in Miletus, until they found 
<A NAME="643"></A>that he would not accept their challenge, and then retired again to Samos 
<A NAME="644"></A>and remained quiet.
<A NAME="645"></A><BR><BR>In the same winter the twenty-seven ships equipped by the Lacedaemonians 
<A NAME="646"></A>for Pharnabazus through the agency of the Megarian Calligeitus, and the 
<A NAME="647"></A>Cyzicene Timagoras, put out from Peloponnese and sailed for Ionia about 
<A NAME="648"></A>the time of the solstice, under the command of Antisthenes, a Spartan. 
<A NAME="649"></A>With them the Lacedaemonians also sent eleven Spartans as advisers to Astyochus; 
<A NAME="650"></A>Lichas, son of Arcesilaus, being among the number. Arrived at Miletus, 
<A NAME="651"></A>their orders were to aid in generally superintending the good conduct of 
<A NAME="652"></A>the war; to send off the above ships or a greater or less number to the 
<A NAME="653"></A>Hellespont to Pharnabazus, if they thought proper, appointing Clearchus, 
<A NAME="654"></A>son of Ramphias, who sailed with them, to the command; and further, if 
<A NAME="655"></A>they thought proper, to make Antisthenes admiral, dismissing Astyochus, 
<A NAME="656"></A>whom the letters of Pedaritus had caused to be regarded with suspicion. 
<A NAME="657"></A>Sailing accordingly from Malea across the open sea, the squadron touched 
<A NAME="658"></A>at Melos and there fell in with ten Athenian ships, three of which they 
<A NAME="659"></A>took empty and burned. After this, being afraid that the Athenian vessels 
<A NAME="660"></A>escaped from Melos might, as they in fact did, give information of their 
<A NAME="661"></A>approach to the Athenians at Samos, they sailed to Crete, and having lengthened 
<A NAME="662"></A>their voyage by way of precaution made land at Caunus in Asia, from whence 
<A NAME="663"></A>considering themselves in safety they sent a message to the fleet at Miletus 
<A NAME="664"></A>for a convoy along the coast.
<A NAME="665"></A><BR><BR>Meanwhile the Chians and Pedaritus, undeterred by the backwardness 
<A NAME="666"></A>of Astyochus, went on sending messengers pressing him to come with all 
<A NAME="667"></A>the fleet to assist them against their besiegers, and not to leave the 
<A NAME="668"></A>greatest of the allied states in Ionia to be shut up by sea and overrun 
<A NAME="669"></A>and pillaged by land. There were more slaves at Chios than in any one other 
<A NAME="670"></A>city except Lacedaemon, and being also by reason of their numbers punished 
<A NAME="671"></A>more rigorously when they offended, most of them, when they saw the Athenian 
<A NAME="672"></A>armament firmly established in the island with a fortified position, immediately 
<A NAME="673"></A>deserted to the enemy, and through their knowledge of the country did the 
<A NAME="674"></A>greatest mischief. The Chians therefore urged upon Astyochus that it was 
<A NAME="675"></A>his duty to assist them, while there was still a hope and a possibility 
<A NAME="676"></A>of stopping the enemy's progress, while Delphinium was still in process 
<A NAME="677"></A>of fortification and unfinished, and before the completion of a higher 
<A NAME="678"></A>rampart which was being added to protect the camp and fleet of their besiegers. 
<A NAME="679"></A>Astyochus now saw that the allies also wished it and prepared to go, in 
<A NAME="680"></A>spite of his intention to the contrary owing to the threat already referred 
<A NAME="681"></A>to.
<A NAME="682"></A><BR><BR>In the meantime news came from Caunus of the arrival of the twenty-seven 
<A NAME="683"></A>ships with the Lacedaemonian commissioners; and Astyochus, postponing everything 
<A NAME="684"></A>to the duty of convoying a fleet of that importance, in order to be more 
<A NAME="685"></A>able to command the sea, and to the safe conduct of the Lacedaemonians 
<A NAME="686"></A>sent as spies over his behaviour, at once gave up going to Chios and set 
<A NAME="687"></A>sail for Caunus. As he coasted along he landed at the Meropid Cos and sacked 
<A NAME="688"></A>the city, which was unfortified and had been lately laid in ruins by an 
<A NAME="689"></A>earthquake, by far the greatest in living memory, and, as the inhabitants 
<A NAME="690"></A>had fled to the mountains, overran the country and made booty of all it 
<A NAME="691"></A>contained, letting go, however, the free men. From Cos arriving in the 
<A NAME="692"></A>night at Cnidus he was constrained by the representations of the Cnidians 
<A NAME="693"></A>not to disembark the sailors, but to sail as he was straight against the 
<A NAME="694"></A>twenty Athenian vessels, which with Charminus, one of the commanders at 
<A NAME="695"></A>Samos, were on the watch for the very twenty-seven ships from Peloponnese 
<A NAME="696"></A>which Astyochus was himself sailing to join; the Athenians in Samos having 
<A NAME="697"></A>heard from Melos of their approach, and Charminus being on the look-out 
<A NAME="698"></A>off Syme, Chalce, Rhodes, and Lycia, as he now heard that they were at 
<A NAME="699"></A>Caunus.
<A NAME="700"></A><BR><BR>Astyochus accordingly sailed as he was to Syme, before he was heard 
<A NAME="701"></A>of, in the hope of catching the enemy somewhere out at sea. Rain, however, 
<A NAME="702"></A>and foggy weather encountered him, and caused his ships to straggle and 
<A NAME="703"></A>get into disorder in the dark. In the morning his fleet had parted company 
<A NAME="704"></A>and was most of it still straggling round the island, and the left wing 
<A NAME="705"></A>only in sight of Charminus and the Athenians, who took it for the squadron 
<A NAME="706"></A>which they were watching for from Caunus, and hastily put out against it 
<A NAME="707"></A>with part only of their twenty vessels, and attacking immediately sank 
<A NAME="708"></A>three ships and disabled others, and had the advantage in the action until 
<A NAME="709"></A>the main body of the fleet unexpectedly hove in sight, when they were surrounded 
<A NAME="710"></A>on every side. Upon this they took to flight, and after losing six ships 
<A NAME="711"></A>with the rest escaped to Teutlussa or Beet Island, and from thence to Halicarnassus. 
<A NAME="712"></A>After this the Peloponnesians put into Cnidus and, being joined by the 
<A NAME="713"></A>twenty-seven ships from Caunus, sailed all together and set up a trophy 
<A NAME="714"></A>in Syme, and then returned to anchor at Cnidus.
<A NAME="715"></A><BR><BR>As soon as the Athenians knew of the sea-fight, they sailed with 
<A NAME="716"></A>all the ships at Samos to Syme, and, without attacking or being attacked 
<A NAME="717"></A>by the fleet at Cnidus, took the ships' tackle left at Syme, and touching 
<A NAME="718"></A>at Lorymi on the mainland sailed back to Samos. Meanwhile the Peloponnesian 
<A NAME="719"></A>ships, being now all at Cnidus, underwent such repairs as were needed; 
<A NAME="720"></A>while the eleven Lacedaemonian commissioners conferred with Tissaphernes, 
<A NAME="721"></A>who had come to meet them, upon the points which did not satisfy them in 
<A NAME="722"></A>the past transactions, and upon the best and mutually most advantageous 
<A NAME="723"></A>manner of conducting the war in future. The severest critic of the present 
<A NAME="724"></A>proceedings was Lichas, who said that neither of the treaties could stand, 
<A NAME="725"></A>neither that of Chalcideus, nor that of Therimenes; it being monstrous 
<A NAME="726"></A>that the King should at this date pretend to the possession of all the 
<A NAME="727"></A>country formerly ruled by himself or by his ancestors- a pretension which 
<A NAME="728"></A>implicitly put back under the yoke all the islands- Thessaly, Locris, and 
<A NAME="729"></A>everything as far as Boeotia- and made the Lacedaemonians give to the Hellenes 
<A NAME="730"></A>instead of liberty a Median master. He therefore invited Tissaphernes to 
<A NAME="731"></A>conclude another and a better treaty, as they certainly would not recognize 
<A NAME="732"></A>those existing and did not want any of his pay upon such conditions. This 
<A NAME="733"></A>offended Tissaphernes so much that he went away in a rage without settling 
<A NAME="734"></A>anything.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="735"></A><B>Chapter XXV</B>

<A NAME="736"></A><BR><BR><B>Twentieth and Twenty - first Years of the War -</B> <B>Intrigues 
<A NAME="737"></A>of Alcibiades - Withdrawal of the Persian</B> <B>Subsidies - Oligarchical 
<A NAME="738"></A>Coup d'Etat at</B> <B>Athens - Patriotism of the Army at 
<A NAME="739"></A>Samos</B>
<A NAME="740"></A><BR><BR>The Peloponnesians now determined to sail to Rhodes, upon the invitation 
<A NAME="741"></A>of some of the principal men there, hoping to gain an island powerful by 
<A NAME="742"></A>the number of its seamen and by its land forces, and also thinking that 
<A NAME="743"></A>they would be able to maintain their fleet from their own confederacy, 
<A NAME="744"></A>without having to ask for money from Tissaphernes. They accordingly at 
<A NAME="745"></A>once set sail that same winter from Cnidus, and first put in with ninety-four 
<A NAME="746"></A>ships at Camirus in the Rhodian country, to the great alarm of the mass 
<A NAME="747"></A>of the inhabitants, who were not privy to the intrigue, and who consequently 
<A NAME="748"></A>fled, especially as the town was unfortified. They were afterwards, however, 
<A NAME="749"></A>assembled by the Lacedaemonians together with the inhabitants of the two 
<A NAME="750"></A>other towns of Lindus and Ialysus; and the Rhodians were persuaded to revolt 
<A NAME="751"></A>from the Athenians and the island went over to the Peloponnesians. Meanwhile 
<A NAME="752"></A>the Athenians had received the alarm and set sail with the fleet from Samos 
<A NAME="753"></A>to forestall them, and came within sight of the island, but being a little 
<A NAME="754"></A>too late sailed off for the moment to Chalce, and from thence to Samos, 
<A NAME="755"></A>and subsequently waged war against Rhodes, issuing from Chalce, Cos, and 
<A NAME="756"></A>Samos.
<A NAME="757"></A><BR><BR>The Peloponnesians now levied a contribution of thirty-two talents 
<A NAME="758"></A>from the Rhodians, after which they hauled their ships ashore and for eighty 
<A NAME="759"></A>days remained inactive. During this time, and even earlier, before they 
<A NAME="760"></A>removed to Rhodes, the following intrigues took place. After the death 
<A NAME="761"></A>of Chalcideus and the battle at Miletus, Alcibiades began to be suspected 
<A NAME="762"></A>by the Peloponnesians; and Astyochus received from Lacedaemon an order 
<A NAME="763"></A>from them to put him to death, he being the personal enemy of Agis, and 
<A NAME="764"></A>in other respects thought unworthy of confidence. Alcibiades in his alarm 
<A NAME="765"></A>first withdrew to Tissaphernes, and immediately began to do all he could 
<A NAME="766"></A>with him to injure the Peloponnesian cause. Henceforth becoming his adviser 
<A NAME="767"></A>in everything, he cut down the pay from an Attic drachma to three obols 
<A NAME="768"></A>a day, and even this not paid too regularly; and told Tissaphernes to say 
<A NAME="769"></A>to the Peloponnesians that the Athenians, whose maritime experience was 
<A NAME="770"></A>of an older date than their own, only gave their men three obols, not so 
<A NAME="771"></A>much from poverty as to prevent their seamen being corrupted by being too 
<A NAME="772"></A>well off, and injuring their condition by spending money upon enervating 
<A NAME="773"></A>indulgences, and also paid their crews irregularly in order to have a security 
<A NAME="774"></A>against their deserting in the arrears which they would leave behind them. 
<A NAME="775"></A>He also told Tissaphernes to bribe the captains and generals of the cities, 
<A NAME="776"></A>and so to obtain their connivance- an expedient which succeeded with all 
<A NAME="777"></A>except the Syracusans, Hermocrates alone opposing him on behalf of the 
<A NAME="778"></A>whole confederacy. Meanwhile the cities asking for money Alcibiades sent 
<A NAME="779"></A>off, by roundly telling them in the name of Tissaphernes that it was great 
<A NAME="780"></A>impudence in the Chians, the richest people in Hellas, not content with 
<A NAME="781"></A>being defended by a foreign force, to expect others to risk not only their 
<A NAME="782"></A>lives but their money as well in behalf of their freedom; while the other 
<A NAME="783"></A>cities, he said, had had to pay largely to Athens before their rebellion, 
<A NAME="784"></A>and could not justly refuse to contribute as much or even more now for 
<A NAME="785"></A>their own selves. He also pointed out that Tissaphernes was at present 
<A NAME="786"></A>carrying on the war at his own charges, and had good cause for economy, 
<A NAME="787"></A>but that as soon as he received remittances from the king he would give 
<A NAME="788"></A>them their pay in full and do what was reasonable for the 
<A NAME="789"></A>cities.
<A NAME="790"></A><BR><BR>Alcibiades further advised Tissaphernes not to be in too great 
<A NAME="791"></A>a hurry to end the war, or to let himself be persuaded to bring up the 
<A NAME="792"></A>Phoenician fleet which he was equipping, or to provide pay for more Hellenes, 
<A NAME="793"></A>and thus put the power by land and sea into the same hands; but to leave 
<A NAME="794"></A>each of the contending parties in possession of one element, thus enabling 
<A NAME="795"></A>the king when he found one troublesome to call in the other. For if the 
<A NAME="796"></A>command of the sea and land were united in one hand, he would not know 
<A NAME="797"></A>where to turn for help to overthrow the dominant power; unless he at last 
<A NAME="798"></A>chose to stand up himself, and go through with the struggle at great expense 
<A NAME="799"></A>and hazard. The cheapest plan was to let the Hellenes wear each other out, 
<A NAME="800"></A>at a small share of the expense and without risk to himself. Besides, he 
<A NAME="801"></A>would find the Athenians the most convenient partners in empire as they 
<A NAME="802"></A>did not aim at conquests on shore, and carried on the war upon principles 
<A NAME="803"></A>and with a practice most advantageous to the King; being prepared to combine 
<A NAME="804"></A>to conquer the sea for Athens, and for the King all the Hellenes inhabiting 
<A NAME="805"></A>his country, whom the Peloponnesians, on the contrary, had come to liberate. 
<A NAME="806"></A>Now it was not likely that the Lacedaemonians would free the Hellenes from 
<A NAME="807"></A>the Hellenic Athenians, without freeing them also from the barbarian Mede, 
<A NAME="808"></A>unless overthrown by him in the meanwhile. Alcibiades therefore urged him 
<A NAME="809"></A>to wear them both out at first, and, after docking the Athenian power as 
<A NAME="810"></A>much as he could, forthwith to rid the country of the Peloponnesians. In 
<A NAME="811"></A>the main Tissaphernes approved of this policy, so far at least as could 
<A NAME="812"></A>be conjectured from his behaviour; since he now gave his confidence to 
<A NAME="813"></A>Alcibiades in recognition of his good advice, and kept the Peloponnesians 
<A NAME="814"></A>short of money, and would not let them fight at sea, but ruined their cause 
<A NAME="815"></A>by pretending that the Phoenician fleet would arrive, and that they would 
<A NAME="816"></A>thus be enabled to contend with the odds in their favour, and so made their 
<A NAME="817"></A>navy lose its efficiency, which had been very remarkable, and generally 
<A NAME="818"></A>betrayed a coolness in the war that was too plain to be 
<A NAME="819"></A>mistaken.
<A NAME="820"></A><BR><BR>Alcibiades gave this advice to Tissaphernes and the King, with 
<A NAME="821"></A>whom he then was, not merely because he thought it really the best, but 
<A NAME="822"></A>because he was studying means to effect his restoration to his country, 
<A NAME="823"></A>well knowing that if he did not destroy it he might one day hope to persuade 
<A NAME="824"></A>the Athenians to recall him, and thinking that his best chance of persuading 
<A NAME="825"></A>them lay in letting them see that he possessed the favour of Tissaphernes. 
<A NAME="826"></A>The event proved him to be right. When the Athenians at Samos found that 
<A NAME="827"></A>he had influence with Tissaphernes, principally of their own motion (though 
<A NAME="828"></A>partly also through Alcibiades himself sending word to their chief men 
<A NAME="829"></A>to tell the best men in the army that, if there were only an oligarchy 
<A NAME="830"></A>in the place of the rascally democracy that had banished him, he would 
<A NAME="831"></A>be glad to return to his country and to make Tissaphernes their friend), 
<A NAME="832"></A>the captains and chief men in the armament at once embraced the idea of 
<A NAME="833"></A>subverting the democracy.
<A NAME="834"></A><BR><BR>The design was first mooted in the camp, and afterwards from thence 
<A NAME="835"></A>reached the city. Some persons crossed over from Samos and had an interview 
<A NAME="836"></A>with Alcibiades, who immediately offered to make first Tissaphernes, and 
<A NAME="837"></A>afterwards the King, their friend, if they would give up the democracy 
<A NAME="838"></A>and make it possible for the King to trust them. The higher class, who 
<A NAME="839"></A>also suffered most severely from the war, now conceived great hopes of 
<A NAME="840"></A>getting the government into their own hands, and of triumphing over the 
<A NAME="841"></A>enemy. Upon their return to Samos the emissaries formed their partisans 
<A NAME="842"></A>into a club, and openly told the mass of the armament that the King would 
<A NAME="843"></A>be their friend, and would provide them with money, if Alcibiades were 
<A NAME="844"></A>restored and the democracy abolished. The multitude, if at first irritated 
<A NAME="845"></A>by these intrigues, were nevertheless kept quiet by the advantageous prospect 
<A NAME="846"></A>of the pay from the King; and the oligarchical conspirators, after making 
<A NAME="847"></A>this communication to the people, now re-examined the proposals of Alcibiades 
<A NAME="848"></A>among themselves, with most of their associates. Unlike the rest, who thought 
<A NAME="849"></A>them advantageous and trustworthy, Phrynichus, who was still general, by 
<A NAME="850"></A>no means approved of the proposals. Alcibiades, he rightly thought, cared 
<A NAME="851"></A>no more for an oligarchy than for a democracy, and only sought to change 
<A NAME="852"></A>the institutions of his country in order to get himself recalled by his 
<A NAME="853"></A>associates; while for themselves their one object should be to avoid civil 
<A NAME="854"></A>discord. It was not the King's interest, when the Peloponnesians were now 
<A NAME="855"></A>their equals at sea, and in possession of some of the chief cities in his 
<A NAME="856"></A>empire, to go out of his way to side with the Athenians whom he did not 
<A NAME="857"></A>trust, when he might make friends of the Peloponnesians who had never injured 
<A NAME="858"></A>him. And as for the allied states to whom oligarchy was now offered, because 
<A NAME="859"></A>the democracy was to be put down at Athens, he well knew that this would 
<A NAME="860"></A>not make the rebels come in any the sooner, or confirm the loyal in their 
<A NAME="861"></A>allegiance; as the allies would never prefer servitude with an oligarchy 
<A NAME="862"></A>or democracy to freedom with the constitution which they actually enjoyed, 
<A NAME="863"></A>to whichever type it belonged. Besides, the cities thought that the so-called 
<A NAME="864"></A>better classes would prove just as oppressive as the commons, as being 
<A NAME="865"></A>those who originated, proposed, and for the most part benefited from the 
<A NAME="866"></A>acts of the commons injurious to the confederates. Indeed, if it depended 
<A NAME="867"></A>on the better classes, the confederates would be put to death without trial 
<A NAME="868"></A>and with violence; while the commons were their refuge and the chastiser 
<A NAME="869"></A>of these men. This he positively knew that the cities had learned by experience, 
<A NAME="870"></A>and that such was their opinion. The propositions of Alcibiades, and the 
<A NAME="871"></A>intrigues now in progress, could therefore never meet with his 
<A NAME="872"></A>approval.
<A NAME="873"></A><BR><BR>However, the members of the club assembled, agreeably to their 
<A NAME="874"></A>original determination, accepted what was proposed, and prepared to send 
<A NAME="875"></A>Pisander and others on an embassy to Athens to treat for the restoration 
<A NAME="876"></A>of Alcibiades and the abolition of the democracy in the city, and thus 
<A NAME="877"></A>to make Tissaphernes the friend of the Athenians.
<A NAME="878"></A><BR><BR>Phrynichus now saw that there would be a proposal to restore Alcibiades, 
<A NAME="879"></A>and that the Athenians would consent to it; and fearing after what he had 
<A NAME="880"></A>said against it that Alcibiades, if restored, would revenge himself upon 
<A NAME="881"></A>him for his opposition, had recourse to the following expedient. He sent 
<A NAME="882"></A>a secret letter to the Lacedaemonian admiral Astyochus, who was still in 
<A NAME="883"></A>the neighbourhood of Miletus, to tell him that Alcibiades was ruining their 
<A NAME="884"></A>cause by making Tissaphernes the friend of the Athenians, and containing 
<A NAME="885"></A>an express revelation of the rest of the intrigue, desiring to be excused 
<A NAME="886"></A>if he sought to harm his enemy even at the expense of the interests of 
<A NAME="887"></A>his country. However, Astyochus, instead of thinking of punishing Alcibiades, 
<A NAME="888"></A>who, besides, no longer ventured within his reach as formerly, went up 
<A NAME="889"></A>to him and Tissaphernes at Magnesia, communicated to them the letter from 
<A NAME="890"></A>Samos, and turned informer, and, if report may be trusted, became the paid 
<A NAME="891"></A>creature of Tissaphernes, undertaking to inform him as to this and all 
<A NAME="892"></A>other matters; which was also the reason why he did not remonstrate more 
<A NAME="893"></A>strongly against the pay not being given in full. Upon this Alcibiades 
<A NAME="894"></A>instantly sent to the authorities at Samos a letter against Phrynichus, 
<A NAME="895"></A>stating what he had done, and requiring that he should be put to death. 
<A NAME="896"></A>Phrynichus distracted, and placed in the utmost peril by the denunciation, 
<A NAME="897"></A>sent again to Astyochus, reproaching him with having so ill kept the secret 
<A NAME="898"></A>of his previous letter, and saying that he was now prepared to give them 
<A NAME="899"></A>an opportunity of destroying the whole Athenian armament at Samos; giving 
<A NAME="900"></A>a detailed account of the means which he should employ, Samos being unfortified, 
<A NAME="901"></A>and pleading that, being in danger of his life on their account, he could 
<A NAME="902"></A>not now be blamed for doing this or anything else to escape being destroyed 
<A NAME="903"></A>by his mortal enemies. This also Astyochus revealed to 
<A NAME="904"></A>Alcibiades.
<A NAME="905"></A><BR><BR>Meanwhile Phrynichus having had timely notice that he was playing 
<A NAME="906"></A>him false, and that a letter on the subject was on the point of arriving 
<A NAME="907"></A>from Alcibiades, himself anticipated the news, and told the army that the 
<A NAME="908"></A>enemy, seeing that Samos was unfortified and the fleet not all stationed 
<A NAME="909"></A>within the harbour, meant to attack the camp, that he could be certain 
<A NAME="910"></A>of this intelligence, and that they must fortify Samos as quickly as possible, 
<A NAME="911"></A>and generally look to their defences. It will be remembered that he was 
<A NAME="912"></A>general, and had himself authority to carry out these measures. Accordingly 
<A NAME="913"></A>they addressed themselves to the work of fortification, and Samos was thus 
<A NAME="914"></A>fortified sooner than it would otherwise have been. Not long afterwards 
<A NAME="915"></A>came the letter from Alcibiades, saying that the army was betrayed by Phrynichus, 
<A NAME="916"></A>and the enemy about to attack it. Alcibiades, however, gained no credit, 
<A NAME="917"></A>it being thought that he was in the secret of the enemy's designs, and 
<A NAME="918"></A>had tried to fasten them upon Phrynichus, and to make out that he was their 
<A NAME="919"></A>accomplice, out of hatred; and consequently far from hurting him he rather 
<A NAME="920"></A>bore witness to what he had said by this intelligence.
<A NAME="921"></A><BR><BR>After this Alcibiades set to work to persuade Tissaphernes to become 
<A NAME="922"></A>the friend of the Athenians. Tissaphernes, although afraid of the Peloponnesians 
<A NAME="923"></A>because they had more ships in Asia than the Athenians, was yet disposed 
<A NAME="924"></A>to be persuaded if he could, especially after his quarrel with the Peloponnesians 
<A NAME="925"></A>at Cnidus about the treaty of Therimenes. The quarrel had already taken 
<A NAME="926"></A>place, as the Peloponnesians were by this time actually at Rhodes; and 
<A NAME="927"></A>in it the original argument of Alcibiades touching the liberation of all 
<A NAME="928"></A>the towns by the Lacedaemonians had been verified by the declaration of 
<A NAME="929"></A>Lichas that it was impossible to submit to a convention which made the 
<A NAME="930"></A>King master of all the states at any former time ruled by himself or by 
<A NAME="931"></A>his fathers.
<A NAME="932"></A><BR><BR>While Alcibiades was besieging the favour of Tissaphernes with 
<A NAME="933"></A>an earnestness proportioned to the greatness of the issue, the Athenian 
<A NAME="934"></A>envoys who had been dispatched from Samos with Pisander arrived at Athens, 
<A NAME="935"></A>and made a speech before the people, giving a brief summary of their views, 
<A NAME="936"></A>and particularly insisting that, if Alcibiades were recalled and the democratic 
<A NAME="937"></A>constitution changed, they could have the King as their ally, and would 
<A NAME="938"></A>be able to overcome the Peloponnesians. A number of speakers opposed them 
<A NAME="939"></A>on the question of the democracy, the enemies of Alcibiades cried out against 
<A NAME="940"></A>the scandal of a restoration to be effected by a violation of the constitution, 
<A NAME="941"></A>and the Eumolpidae and Ceryces protested in behalf of the mysteries, the 
<A NAME="942"></A>cause of his banishment, and called upon the gods to avert his recall; 
<A NAME="943"></A>when Pisander, in the midst of much opposition and abuse, came forward, 
<A NAME="944"></A>and taking each of his opponents aside asked him the following question: 
<A NAME="945"></A>In the face of the fact that the Peloponnesians had as many ships as their 
<A NAME="946"></A>own confronting them at sea, more cities in alliance with them, and the 
<A NAME="947"></A>King and Tissaphernes to supply them with money, of which the Athenians 
<A NAME="948"></A>had none left, had he any hope of saving the state, unless someone could 
<A NAME="949"></A>induce the King to come over to their side? Upon their replying that they 
<A NAME="950"></A>had not, he then plainly said to them: "This we cannot have unless we have 
<A NAME="951"></A>a more moderate form of government, and put the offices into fewer hands, 
<A NAME="952"></A>and so gain the King's confidence, and forthwith restore Alcibiades, who 
<A NAME="953"></A>is the only man living that can bring this about. The safety of the state, 
<A NAME="954"></A>not the form of its government, is for the moment the most pressing question, 
<A NAME="955"></A>as we can always change afterwards whatever we do not 
<A NAME="956"></A>like."
<A NAME="957"></A><BR><BR>The people were at first highly irritated at the mention of an 
<A NAME="958"></A>oligarchy, but upon understanding clearly from Pisander that this was the 
<A NAME="959"></A>only resource left, they took counsel of their fears, and promised themselves 
<A NAME="960"></A>some day to change the government again, and gave way. They accordingly 
<A NAME="961"></A>voted that Pisander should sail with ten others and make the best arrangement 
<A NAME="962"></A>that they could with Tissaphernes and Alcibiades. At the same time the 
<A NAME="963"></A>people, upon a false accusation of Pisander, dismissed Phrynichus from 
<A NAME="964"></A>his post together with his colleague Scironides, sending Diomedon and Leon 
<A NAME="965"></A>to replace them in the command of the fleet. The accusation was that Phrynichus 
<A NAME="966"></A>had betrayed Iasus and Amorges; and Pisander brought it because he thought 
<A NAME="967"></A>him a man unfit for the business now in hand with Alcibiades. Pisander 
<A NAME="968"></A>also went the round of all the clubs already existing in the city for help 
<A NAME="969"></A>in lawsuits and elections, and urged them to draw together and to unite 
<A NAME="970"></A>their efforts for the overthrow of the democracy; and after taking all 
<A NAME="971"></A>other measures required by the circumstances, so that no time might be 
<A NAME="972"></A>lost, set off with his ten companions on his voyage to 
<A NAME="973"></A>Tissaphernes.
<A NAME="974"></A><BR><BR>In the same winter Leon and Diomedon, who had by this time joined 
<A NAME="975"></A>the fleet, made an attack upon Rhodes. The ships of the Peloponnesians 
<A NAME="976"></A>they found hauled up on shore, and, after making a descent upon the coast 
<A NAME="977"></A>and defeating the Rhodians who appeared in the field against them, withdrew 
<A NAME="978"></A>to Chalce and made that place their base of operations instead of Cos, 
<A NAME="979"></A>as they could better observe from thence if the Peloponnesian fleet put 
<A NAME="980"></A>out to sea. Meanwhile Xenophantes, a Laconian, came to Rhodes from Pedaritus 
<A NAME="981"></A>at Chios, with the news that the fortification of the Athenians was now 
<A NAME="982"></A>finished, and that, unless the whole Peloponnesian fleet came to the rescue, 
<A NAME="983"></A>the cause in Chios must be lost. Upon this they resolved to go to his relief. 
<A NAME="984"></A>In the meantime Pedaritus, with the mercenaries that he had with him and 
<A NAME="985"></A>the whole force of the Chians, made an assault upon the work round the 
<A NAME="986"></A>Athenian ships and took a portion of it, and got possession of some vessels 
<A NAME="987"></A>that were hauled up on shore, when the Athenians sallied out to the rescue, 
<A NAME="988"></A>and first routing the Chians, next defeated the remainder of the force 
<A NAME="989"></A>round Pedaritus, who was himself killed, with many of the Chians, a great 
<A NAME="990"></A>number of arms being also taken.
<A NAME="991"></A><BR><BR>After this the Chians were besieged even more straitly than before 
<A NAME="992"></A>by land and sea, and the famine in the place was great. Meanwhile the Athenian 
<A NAME="993"></A>envoys with Pisander arrived at the court of Tissaphernes, and conferred 
<A NAME="994"></A>with him about the proposed agreement. However, Alcibiades, not being altogether 
<A NAME="995"></A>sure of Tissaphernes (who feared the Peloponnesians more than the Athenians, 
<A NAME="996"></A>and besides wished to wear out both parties, as Alcibiades himself had 
<A NAME="997"></A>recommended), had recourse to the following stratagem to make the treaty 
<A NAME="998"></A>between the Athenians and Tissaphernes miscarry by reason of the magnitude 
<A NAME="999"></A>of his demands. In my opinion Tissaphernes desired this result, fear being 
<A NAME="1000"></A>his motive; while Alcibiades, who now saw that Tissaphernes was determined 
<A NAME="1001"></A>not to treat on any terms, wished the Athenians to think, not that he was 
<A NAME="1002"></A>unable to persuade Tissaphernes, but that after the latter had been persuaded 
<A NAME="1003"></A>and was willing to join them, they had not conceded enough to him. For 
<A NAME="1004"></A>the demands of Alcibiades, speaking for Tissaphernes, who was present, 
<A NAME="1005"></A>were so extravagant that the Athenians, although for a long while they 
<A NAME="1006"></A>agreed to whatever he asked, yet had to bear the blame of failure: he required 
<A NAME="1007"></A>the cession of the whole of Ionia, next of the islands adjacent, besides 
<A NAME="1008"></A>other concessions, and these passed without opposition; at last, in the 
<A NAME="1009"></A>third interview, Alcibiades, who now feared a complete discovery of his 
<A NAME="1010"></A>inability, required them to allow the King to build ships and sail along 
<A NAME="1011"></A>his own coast wherever and with as many as he pleased. Upon this the Athenians 
<A NAME="1012"></A>would yield no further, and concluding that there was nothing to be done, 
<A NAME="1013"></A>but that they had been deceived by Alcibiades, went away in a passion and 
<A NAME="1014"></A>proceeded to Samos.
<A NAME="1015"></A><BR><BR>Tissaphernes immediately after this, in the same winter, proceeded 
<A NAME="1016"></A>along shore to Caunus, desiring to bring the Peloponnesian fleet back to 
<A NAME="1017"></A>Miletus, and to supply them with pay, making a fresh convention upon such 
<A NAME="1018"></A>terms as he could get, in order not to bring matters to an absolute breach 
<A NAME="1019"></A>between them. He was afraid that if many of their ships were left without 
<A NAME="1020"></A>pay they would be compelled to engage and be defeated, or that their vessels 
<A NAME="1021"></A>being left without hands the Athenians would attain their objects without 
<A NAME="1022"></A>his assistance. Still more he feared that the Peloponnesians might ravage 
<A NAME="1023"></A>the continent in search of supplies. Having calculated and considered all 
<A NAME="1024"></A>this, agreeably to his plan of keeping the two sides equal, he now sent 
<A NAME="1025"></A>for the Peloponnesians and gave them pay, and concluded with them a third 
<A NAME="1026"></A>treaty in words following:
<A NAME="1027"></A><BR><BR>In the thirteenth year of the reign of Darius, while Alexippidas 
<A NAME="1028"></A>was ephor at Lacedaemon, a convention was concluded in the plain of the 
<A NAME="1029"></A>Maeander by the Lacedaemonians and their allies with Tissaphernes, Hieramenes, 
<A NAME="1030"></A>and the sons of Pharnaces, concerning the affairs of the King and of the 
<A NAME="1031"></A>Lacedaemonians and their allies.
<A NAME="1032"></A><BR><BR><B>1.</B> The country of the King in Asia shall be the King's, 
<A NAME="1033"></A>and the King shall treat his own country as he pleases.
<A NAME="1034"></A><BR><BR><B>2.</B> The Lacedaemonians and their allies shall not invade 
<A NAME="1035"></A>or injure the King's country: neither shall the King invade or injure that 
<A NAME="1036"></A>of the Lacedaemonians or of their allies. If any of the Lacedaemonians 
<A NAME="1037"></A>or of their allies invade or injure the King's country, the Lacedaemonians 
<A NAME="1038"></A>and their allies shall prevent it: and if any from the King's country invade 
<A NAME="1039"></A>or injure the country of the Lacedaemonians or of their allies, the King 
<A NAME="1040"></A>shall prevent it.
<A NAME="1041"></A><BR><BR><B>3.</B> Tissaphernes shall provide pay for the ships now present, 
<A NAME="1042"></A>according to the agreement, until the arrival of the King's vessels: but 
<A NAME="1043"></A>after the arrival of the King's vessels the Lacedaemonians and their allies 
<A NAME="1044"></A>may pay their own ships if they wish it. If, however, they choose to receive 
<A NAME="1045"></A>the pay from Tissaphernes, Tissaphernes shall furnish it: and the Lacedaemonians 
<A NAME="1046"></A>and their allies shall repay him at the end of the war such moneys as they 
<A NAME="1047"></A>shall have received.
<A NAME="1048"></A><BR><BR><B>4.</B> After the vessels have arrived, the ships of the Lacedaemonians 
<A NAME="1049"></A>and of their allies and those of the King shall carry on the war jointly, 
<A NAME="1050"></A>according as Tissaphernes and the Lacedaemonians and their allies shall 
<A NAME="1051"></A>think best. If they wish to make peace with the Athenians, they shall make 
<A NAME="1052"></A>peace also jointly.
<A NAME="1053"></A><BR><BR>This was the treaty. After this Tissaphernes prepared to bring 
<A NAME="1054"></A>up the Phoenician fleet according to agreement, and to make good his other 
<A NAME="1055"></A>promises, or at all events wished to make it appear that he was so 
<A NAME="1056"></A>preparing.
<A NAME="1057"></A><BR><BR>Winter was now drawing towards its close, when the Boeotians took 
<A NAME="1058"></A>Oropus by treachery, though held by an Athenian garrison. Their accomplices 
<A NAME="1059"></A>in this were some of the Eretrians and of the Oropians themselves, who 
<A NAME="1060"></A>were plotting the revolt of Euboea, as the place was exactly opposite Eretria, 
<A NAME="1061"></A>and while in Athenian hands was necessarily a source of great annoyance 
<A NAME="1062"></A>to Eretria and the rest of Euboea. Oropus being in their hands, the Eretrians 
<A NAME="1063"></A>now came to Rhodes to invite the Peloponnesians into Euboea. The latter, 
<A NAME="1064"></A>however, were rather bent on the relief of the distressed Chians, and accordingly 
<A NAME="1065"></A>put out to sea and sailed with all their ships from Rhodes. Off Triopium 
<A NAME="1066"></A>they sighted the Athenian fleet out at sea sailing from Chalce, and, neither 
<A NAME="1067"></A>attacking the other, arrived, the latter at Samos, the Peloponnesians at 
<A NAME="1068"></A>Miletus, seeing that it was no longer possible to relieve Chios without 
<A NAME="1069"></A>a battle. And this winter ended, and with it ended the twentieth year of 
<A NAME="1070"></A>this war of which Thucydides is the historian.
<A NAME="1071"></A><BR><BR>Early in the spring of the summer following, Dercyllidas, a Spartan, 
<A NAME="1072"></A>was sent with a small force by land to the Hellespont to effect the revolt 
<A NAME="1073"></A>of Abydos, which is a Milesian colony; and the Chians, while Astyochus 
<A NAME="1074"></A>was at a loss how to help them, were compelled to fight at sea by the pressure 
<A NAME="1075"></A>of the siege. While Astyochus was still at Rhodes they had received from 
<A NAME="1076"></A>Miletus, as their commander after the death of Pedaritus, a Spartan named 
<A NAME="1077"></A>Leon, who had come out with Antisthenes, and twelve vessels which had been 
<A NAME="1078"></A>on guard at Miletus, five of which were Thurian, four Syracusans, one from 
<A NAME="1079"></A>Anaia, one Milesian, and one Leon's own. Accordingly the Chians marched 
<A NAME="1080"></A>out in mass and took up a strong position, while thirty-six of their ships 
<A NAME="1081"></A>put out and engaged thirty-two of the Athenians; and after a tough fight, 
<A NAME="1082"></A>in which the Chians and their allies had rather the best of it, as it was 
<A NAME="1083"></A>now late, retired to their city.
<A NAME="1084"></A><BR><BR>Immediately after this Dercyllidas arrived by land from Miletus; 
<A NAME="1085"></A>and Abydos in the Hellespont revolted to him and Pharnabazus, and Lampsacus 
<A NAME="1086"></A>two days later. Upon receipt of this news Strombichides hastily sailed 
<A NAME="1087"></A>from Chios with twenty-four Athenian ships, some transports carrying heavy 
<A NAME="1088"></A>infantry being of the n
