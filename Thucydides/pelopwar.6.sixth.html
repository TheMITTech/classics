<A NAME="10"></A><B>Chapter XVIII</B>
<A NAME="11"></A><BR><BR><B>Seventeenth Year of the War - The Sicilian</B> <B>Campaign - 
<A NAME="12"></A>Affair of the Hermae -</B> <B>Departure of the Expedition</B>
<A NAME="13"></A><BR><BR>The same winter the Athenians resolved to sail again to Sicily, 
<A NAME="14"></A>with a greater armament than that under Laches and Eurymedon, and, if possible, 
<A NAME="15"></A>to conquer the island; most of them being ignorant of its size and of the 
<A NAME="16"></A>number of its inhabitants, Hellenic and barbarian, and of the fact that 
<A NAME="17"></A>they were undertaking a war not much inferior to that against the Peloponnesians. 
<A NAME="18"></A>For the voyage round Sicily in a merchantman is not far short of eight 
<A NAME="19"></A>days; and yet, large as the island is, there are only two miles of sea 
<A NAME="20"></A>to prevent its being mainland.
<A NAME="21"></A><BR><BR>It was settled originally as follows, and the peoples that occupied 
<A NAME="22"></A>it are these. The earliest inhabitants spoken of in any part of the country 
<A NAME="23"></A>are the Cyclopes and Laestrygones; but I cannot tell of what race they 
<A NAME="24"></A>were, or whence they came or whither they went, and must leave my readers 
<A NAME="25"></A>to what the poets have said of them and to what may be generally known 
<A NAME="26"></A>concerning them. The Sicanians appear to have been the next settlers, although 
<A NAME="27"></A>they pretend to have been the first of all and aborigines; but the facts 
<A NAME="28"></A>show that they were Iberians, driven by the Ligurians from the river Sicanus 
<A NAME="29"></A>in Iberia. It was from them that the island, before called Trinacria, took 
<A NAME="30"></A>its name of Sicania, and to the present day they inhabit the west of Sicily. 
<A NAME="31"></A>On the fall of Ilium, some of the Trojans escaped from the Achaeans, came 
<A NAME="32"></A>in ships to Sicily, and settled next to the Sicanians under the general 
<A NAME="33"></A>name of Elymi; their towns being called Eryx and Egesta. With them settled 
<A NAME="34"></A>some of the Phocians carried on their way from Troy by a storm, first to 
<A NAME="35"></A>Libya, and afterwards from thence to Sicily. The Sicels crossed over to 
<A NAME="36"></A>Sicily from their first home Italy, flying from the Opicans, as tradition 
<A NAME="37"></A>says and as seems not unlikely, upon rafts, having watched till the wind 
<A NAME="38"></A>set down the strait to effect the passage; although perhaps they may have 
<A NAME="39"></A>sailed over in some other way. Even at the present day there are still 
<A NAME="40"></A>Sicels in Italy; and the country got its name of Italy from Italus, a king 
<A NAME="41"></A>of the Sicels, so called. These went with a great host to Sicily, defeated 
<A NAME="42"></A>the Sicanians in battle and forced them to remove to the south and west 
<A NAME="43"></A>of the island, which thus came to be called Sicily instead of Sicania, 
<A NAME="44"></A>and after they crossed over continued to enjoy the richest parts of the 
<A NAME="45"></A>country for near three hundred years before any Hellenes came to Sicily; 
<A NAME="46"></A>indeed they still hold the centre and north of the island. There were also 
<A NAME="47"></A>Phoenicians living all round Sicily, who had occupied promontories upon 
<A NAME="48"></A>the sea coasts and the islets adjacent for the purpose of trading with 
<A NAME="49"></A>the Sicels. But when the Hellenes began to arrive in considerable numbers 
<A NAME="50"></A>by sea, the Phoenicians abandoned most of their stations, and drawing together 
<A NAME="51"></A>took up their abode in Motye, Soloeis, and Panormus, near the Elymi, partly 
<A NAME="52"></A>because they confided in their alliance, and also because these are the 
<A NAME="53"></A>nearest points for the voyage between Carthage and Sicily.
<A NAME="54"></A><BR><BR>These were the barbarians in Sicily, settled as I have said. Of 
<A NAME="55"></A>the Hellenes, the first to arrive were Chalcidians from Euboea with Thucles, 
<A NAME="56"></A>their founder. They founded Naxos and built the altar to Apollo Archegetes, 
<A NAME="57"></A>which now stands outside the town, and upon which the deputies for the 
<A NAME="58"></A>games sacrifice before sailing from Sicily. Syracuse was founded the year 
<A NAME="59"></A>afterwards by Archias, one of the Heraclids from Corinth, who began by 
<A NAME="60"></A>driving out the Sicels from the island upon which the inner city now stands, 
<A NAME="61"></A>though it is no longer surrounded by water: in process of time the outer 
<A NAME="62"></A>town also was taken within the walls and became populous. Meanwhile Thucles 
<A NAME="63"></A>and the Chalcidians set out from Naxos in the fifth year after the foundation 
<A NAME="64"></A>of Syracuse, and drove out the Sicels by arms and founded Leontini and 
<A NAME="65"></A>afterwards Catana; the Catanians themselves choosing Evarchus as their 
<A NAME="66"></A>founder.
<A NAME="67"></A><BR><BR>About the same time Lamis arrived in Sicily with a colony from 
<A NAME="68"></A>Megara, and after founding a place called Trotilus beyond the river Pantacyas, 
<A NAME="69"></A>and afterwards leaving it and for a short while joining the Chalcidians 
<A NAME="70"></A>at Leontini, was driven out by them and founded Thapsus. After his death 
<A NAME="71"></A>his companions were driven out of Thapsus, and founded a place called the 
<A NAME="72"></A>Hyblaean Megara; Hyblon, a Sicel king, having given up the place and inviting 
<A NAME="73"></A>them thither. Here they lived two hundred and forty-five years; after which 
<A NAME="74"></A>they were expelled from the city and the country by the Syracusan tyrant 
<A NAME="75"></A>Gelo. Before their expulsion, however, a hundred years after they had settled 
<A NAME="76"></A>there, they sent out Pamillus and founded Selinus; he having come from 
<A NAME="77"></A>their mother country Megara to join them in its foundation. Gela was founded 
<A NAME="78"></A>by Antiphemus from Rhodes and Entimus from Crete, who joined in leading 
<A NAME="79"></A>a colony thither, in the forty-fifth year after the foundation of Syracuse. 
<A NAME="80"></A>The town took its name from the river Gelas, the place where the citadel 
<A NAME="81"></A>now stands, and which was first fortified, being called Lindii. The institutions 
<A NAME="82"></A>which they adopted were Dorian. Near one hundred and eight years after 
<A NAME="83"></A>the foundation of Gela, the Geloans founded Acragas (Agrigentum), so called 
<A NAME="84"></A>from the river of that name, and made Aristonous and Pystilus their founders; 
<A NAME="85"></A>giving their own institutions to the colony. Zancle was originally founded 
<A NAME="86"></A>by pirates from Cuma, the Chalcidian town in the country of the Opicans: 
<A NAME="87"></A>afterwards, however, large numbers came from Chalcis and the rest of Euboea, 
<A NAME="88"></A>and helped to people the place; the founders being Perieres and Crataemenes 
<A NAME="89"></A>from Cuma and Chalcis respectively. It first had the name of Zancle given 
<A NAME="90"></A>it by the Sicels, because the place is shaped like a sickle, which the 
<A NAME="91"></A>Sicels call zanclon; but upon the original settlers being afterwards expelled 
<A NAME="92"></A>by some Samians and other Ionians who landed in Sicily flying from the 
<A NAME="93"></A>Medes, and the Samians in their turn not long afterwards by Anaxilas, tyrant 
<A NAME="94"></A>of Rhegium, the town was by him colonized with a mixed population, and 
<A NAME="95"></A>its name changed to Messina, after his old country.
<A NAME="96"></A><BR><BR>Himera was founded from Zancle by Euclides, Simus, and Sacon, most 
<A NAME="97"></A>of those who went to the colony being Chalcidians; though they were joined 
<A NAME="98"></A>by some exiles from Syracuse, defeated in a civil war, called the Myletidae. 
<A NAME="99"></A>The language was a mixture of Chalcidian and Doric, but the institutions 
<A NAME="100"></A>which prevailed were the Chalcidian. Acrae and Casmenae were founded by 
<A NAME="101"></A>the Syracusans; Acrae seventy years after Syracuse, Casmenae nearly twenty 
<A NAME="102"></A>after Acrae. Camarina was first founded by the Syracusans, close upon a 
<A NAME="103"></A>hundred and thirty-five years after the building of Syracuse; its founders 
<A NAME="104"></A>being Daxon and Menecolus. But the Camarinaeans being expelled by arms 
<A NAME="105"></A>by the Syracusans for having revolted, Hippocrates, tyrant of Gela, some 
<A NAME="106"></A>time later receiving their land in ransom for some Syracusan prisoners, 
<A NAME="107"></A>resettled Camarina, himself acting as its founder. Lastly, it was again 
<A NAME="108"></A>depopulated by Gelo, and settled once more for the third time by the 
<A NAME="109"></A>Geloans.
<A NAME="110"></A><BR><BR>Such is the list of the peoples, Hellenic and barbarian, inhabiting 
<A NAME="111"></A>Sicily, and such the magnitude of the island which the Athenians were now 
<A NAME="112"></A>bent upon invading; being ambitious in real truth of conquering the whole, 
<A NAME="113"></A>although they had also the specious design of succouring their kindred 
<A NAME="114"></A>and other allies in the island. But they were especially incited by envoys 
<A NAME="115"></A>from Egesta, who had come to Athens and invoked their aid more urgently 
<A NAME="116"></A>than ever. The Egestaeans had gone to war with their neighbours the Selinuntines 
<A NAME="117"></A>upon questions of marriage and disputed territory, and the Selinuntines 
<A NAME="118"></A>had procured the alliance of the Syracusans, and pressed Egesta hard by 
<A NAME="119"></A>land and sea. The Egestaeans now reminded the Athenians of the alliance 
<A NAME="120"></A>made in the time of Laches, during the former Leontine war, and begged 
<A NAME="121"></A>them to send a fleet to their aid, and among a number of other considerations 
<A NAME="122"></A>urged as a capital argument that if the Syracusans were allowed to go unpunished 
<A NAME="123"></A>for their depopulation of Leontini, to ruin the allies still left to Athens 
<A NAME="124"></A>in Sicily, and to get the whole power of the island into their hands, there 
<A NAME="125"></A>would be a danger of their one day coming with a large force, as Dorians, 
<A NAME="126"></A>to the aid of their Dorian brethren, and as colonists, to the aid of the 
<A NAME="127"></A>Peloponnesians who had sent them out, and joining these in pulling down 
<A NAME="128"></A>the Athenian empire. The Athenians would, therefore, do well to unite with 
<A NAME="129"></A>the allies still left to them, and to make a stand against the Syracusans; 
<A NAME="130"></A>especially as they, the Egestaeans, were prepared to furnish money sufficient 
<A NAME="131"></A>for the war. The Athenians, hearing these arguments constantly repeated 
<A NAME="132"></A>in their assemblies by the Egestaeans and their supporters, voted first 
<A NAME="133"></A>to send envoys to Egesta, to see if there was really the money that they 
<A NAME="134"></A>talked of in the treasury and temples, and at the same time to ascertain 
<A NAME="135"></A>in what posture was the war with the Selinuntines.
<A NAME="136"></A><BR><BR>The envoys of the Athenians were accordingly dispatched to Sicily. 
<A NAME="137"></A>The same winter the Lacedaemonians and their allies, the Corinthians excepted, 
<A NAME="138"></A>marched into the Argive territory, and ravaged a small part of the land, 
<A NAME="139"></A>and took some yokes of oxen and carried off some corn. They also settled 
<A NAME="140"></A>the Argive exiles at Orneae, and left them a few soldiers taken from the 
<A NAME="141"></A>rest of the army; and after making a truce for a certain while, according 
<A NAME="142"></A>to which neither Orneatae nor Argives were to injure each other's territory, 
<A NAME="143"></A>returned home with the army. Not long afterwards the Athenians came with 
<A NAME="144"></A>thirty ships and six hundred heavy infantry, and the Argives joining them 
<A NAME="145"></A>with all their forces, marched out and besieged the men in Orneae for one 
<A NAME="146"></A>day; but the garrison escaped by night, the besiegers having bivouacked 
<A NAME="147"></A>some way off. The next day the Argives, discovering it, razed Orneae to 
<A NAME="148"></A>the ground, and went back again; after which the Athenians went home in 
<A NAME="149"></A>their ships. Meanwhile the Athenians took by sea to Methone on the Macedonian 
<A NAME="150"></A>border some cavalry of their own and the Macedonian exiles that were at 
<A NAME="151"></A>Athens, and plundered the country of Perdiccas. Upon this the Lacedaemonians 
<A NAME="152"></A>sent to the Thracian Chalcidians, who had a truce with Athens from one 
<A NAME="153"></A>ten days to another, urging them to join Perdiccas in the war, which they 
<A NAME="154"></A>refused to do. And the winter ended, and with it ended the sixteenth year 
<A NAME="155"></A>of this war of which Thucydides is the historian.
<A NAME="156"></A><BR><BR>Early in the spring of the following summer the Athenian envoys 
<A NAME="157"></A>arrived from Sicily, and the Egestaeans with them, bringing sixty talents 
<A NAME="158"></A>of uncoined silver, as a month's pay for sixty ships, which they were to 
<A NAME="159"></A>ask to have sent them. The Athenians held an assembly and, after hearing 
<A NAME="160"></A>from the Egestaeans and their own envoys a report, as attractive as it 
<A NAME="161"></A>was untrue, upon the state of affairs generally, and in particular as to 
<A NAME="162"></A>the money, of which, it was said, there was abundance in the temples and 
<A NAME="163"></A>the treasury, voted to send sixty ships to Sicily, under the command of 
<A NAME="164"></A>Alcibiades, son of Clinias, Nicias, son of Niceratus, and Lamachus, son 
<A NAME="165"></A>of Xenophanes, who were appointed with full powers; they were to help the 
<A NAME="166"></A>Egestaeans against the Selinuntines, to restore Leontini upon gaining any 
<A NAME="167"></A>advantage in the war, and to order all other matters in Sicily as they 
<A NAME="168"></A>should deem best for the interests of Athens. Five days after this a second 
<A NAME="169"></A>assembly was held, to consider the speediest means of equipping the ships, 
<A NAME="170"></A>and to vote whatever else might be required by the generals for the expedition; 
<A NAME="171"></A>and Nicias, who had been chosen to the command against his will, and who 
<A NAME="172"></A>thought that the state was not well advised, but upon a slight aid specious 
<A NAME="173"></A>pretext was aspiring to the conquest of the whole of Sicily, a great matter 
<A NAME="174"></A>to achieve, came forward in the hope of diverting the Athenians from the 
<A NAME="175"></A>enterprise, and gave them the following counsel:
<A NAME="176"></A><BR><BR>"Although this assembly was convened to consider the preparations 
<A NAME="177"></A>to be made for sailing to Sicily, I think, notwithstanding, that we have 
<A NAME="178"></A>still this question to examine, whether it be better to send out the ships 
<A NAME="179"></A>at all, and that we ought not to give so little consideration to a matter 
<A NAME="180"></A>of such moment, or let ourselves be persuaded by foreigners into undertaking 
<A NAME="181"></A>a war with which we have nothing to do. And yet, individually, I gain in 
<A NAME="182"></A>honour by such a course, and fear as little as other men for my person- 
<A NAME="183"></A>not that I think a man need be any the worse citizen for taking some thought 
<A NAME="184"></A>for his person and estate; on the contrary, such a man would for his own 
<A NAME="185"></A>sake desire the prosperity of his country more than others- nevertheless, 
<A NAME="186"></A>as I have never spoken against my convictions to gain honour, I shall not 
<A NAME="187"></A>begin to do so now, but shall say what I think best. Against your character 
<A NAME="188"></A>any words of mine would be weak enough, if I were to advise your keeping 
<A NAME="189"></A>what you have got and not risking what is actually yours for advantages 
<A NAME="190"></A>which are dubious in themselves, and which you may or may not attain. I 
<A NAME="191"></A>will, therefore, content myself with showing that your ardour is out of 
<A NAME="192"></A>season, and your ambition not easy of accomplishment.
<A NAME="193"></A><BR><BR>"I affirm, then, that you leave many enemies behind you here to 
<A NAME="194"></A>go yonder and bring more back with you. You imagine, perhaps, that the 
<A NAME="195"></A>treaty which you have made can be trusted; a treaty that will continue 
<A NAME="196"></A>to exist nominally, as long as you keep quiet- for nominal it has become, 
<A NAME="197"></A>owing to the practices of certain men here and at Sparta- but which in 
<A NAME="198"></A>the event of a serious reverse in any quarter would not delay our enemies 
<A NAME="199"></A>a moment in attacking us; first, because the convention was forced upon 
<A NAME="200"></A>them by disaster and was less honourable to them than to us; and secondly, 
<A NAME="201"></A>because in this very convention there are many points that are still disputed. 
<A NAME="202"></A>Again, some of the most powerful states have never yet accepted the arrangement 
<A NAME="203"></A>at all. Some of these are at open war with us; others (as the Lacedaemonians 
<A NAME="204"></A>do not yet move) are restrained by truces renewed every ten days, and it 
<A NAME="205"></A>is only too probable that if they found our power divided, as we are hurrying 
<A NAME="206"></A>to divide it, they would attack us vigorously with the Siceliots, whose 
<A NAME="207"></A>alliance they would have in the past valued as they would that of few others. 
<A NAME="208"></A>A man ought, therefore, to consider these points, and not to think of running 
<A NAME="209"></A>risks with a country placed so critically, or of grasping at another empire 
<A NAME="210"></A>before we have secured the one we have already; for in fact the Thracian 
<A NAME="211"></A>Chalcidians have been all these years in revolt from us without being yet 
<A NAME="212"></A>subdued, and others on the continents yield us but a doubtful obedience. 
<A NAME="213"></A>Meanwhile the Egestaeans, our allies, have been wronged, and we run to 
<A NAME="214"></A>help them, while the rebels who have so long wronged us still wait for 
<A NAME="215"></A>punishment.
<A NAME="216"></A><BR><BR>"And yet the latter, if brought under, might be kept under; while 
<A NAME="217"></A>the Sicilians, even if conquered, are too far off and too numerous to be 
<A NAME="218"></A>ruled without difficulty. Now it is folly to go against men who could not 
<A NAME="219"></A>be kept under even if conquered, while failure would leave us in a very 
<A NAME="220"></A>different position from that which we occupied before the enterprise. The 
<A NAME="221"></A>Siceliots, again, to take them as they are at present, in the event of 
<A NAME="222"></A>a Syracusan conquest (the favourite bugbear of the Egestaeans), would to 
<A NAME="223"></A>my thinking be even less dangerous to us than before. At present they might 
<A NAME="224"></A>possibly come here as separate states for love of Lacedaemon; in the other 
<A NAME="225"></A>case one empire would scarcely attack another; for after joining the Peloponnesians 
<A NAME="226"></A>to overthrow ours, they could only expect to see the same hands overthrow 
<A NAME="227"></A>their own in the same way. The Hellenes in Sicily would fear us most if 
<A NAME="228"></A>we never went there at all, and next to this, if after displaying our power 
<A NAME="229"></A>we went away again as soon as possible. We all know that that which is 
<A NAME="230"></A>farthest off, and the reputation of which can least be tested, is the object 
<A NAME="231"></A>of admiration; at the least reverse they would at once begin to look down 
<A NAME="232"></A>upon us, and would join our enemies here against us. You have yourselves 
<A NAME="233"></A>experienced this with regard to the Lacedaemonians and their allies, whom 
<A NAME="234"></A>your unexpected success, as compared with what you feared at first, has 
<A NAME="235"></A>made you suddenly despise, tempting you further to aspire to the conquest 
<A NAME="236"></A>of Sicily. Instead, however, of being puffed up by the misfortunes of your 
<A NAME="237"></A>adversaries, you ought to think of breaking their spirit before giving 
<A NAME="238"></A>yourselves up to confidence, and to understand that the one thought awakened 
<A NAME="239"></A>in the Lacedaemonians by their disgrace is how they may even now, if possible, 
<A NAME="240"></A>overthrow us and repair their dishonour; inasmuch as military reputation 
<A NAME="241"></A>is their oldest and chiefest study. Our struggle, therefore, if we are 
<A NAME="242"></A>wise, will not be for the barbarian Egestaeans in Sicily, but how to defend 
<A NAME="243"></A>ourselves most effectually against the oligarchical machinations of 
<A NAME="244"></A>Lacedaemon.
<A NAME="245"></A><BR><BR>"We should also remember that we are but now enjoying some respite 
<A NAME="246"></A>from a great pestilence and from war, to the no small benefit of our estates 
<A NAME="247"></A>and persons, and that it is right to employ these at home on our own behalf, 
<A NAME="248"></A>instead of using them on behalf of these exiles whose interest it is to 
<A NAME="249"></A>lie as fairly as they can, who do nothing but talk themselves and leave 
<A NAME="250"></A>the danger to others, and who if they succeed will show no proper gratitude, 
<A NAME="251"></A>and if they fail will drag down their friends with them. And if there be 
<A NAME="252"></A>any man here, overjoyed at being chosen to command, who urges you to make 
<A NAME="253"></A>the expedition, merely for ends of his own- specially if he be still too 
<A NAME="254"></A>young to command- who seeks to be admired for his stud of horses, but on 
<A NAME="255"></A>account of its heavy expenses hopes for some profit from his appointment, 
<A NAME="256"></A>do not allow such a one to maintain his private splendour at his country's 
<A NAME="257"></A>risk, but remember that such persons injure the public fortune while they 
<A NAME="258"></A>squander their own, and that this is a matter of importance, and not for 
<A NAME="259"></A>a young man to decide or hastily to take in hand.
<A NAME="260"></A><BR><BR>"When I see such persons now sitting here at the side of that same 
<A NAME="261"></A>individual and summoned by him, alarm seizes me; and I, in my turn, summon 
<A NAME="262"></A>any of the older men that may have such a person sitting next him not to 
<A NAME="263"></A>let himself be shamed down, for fear of being thought a coward if he do 
<A NAME="264"></A>not vote for war, but, remembering how rarely success is got by wishing 
<A NAME="265"></A>and how often by forecast, to leave to them the mad dream of conquest, 
<A NAME="266"></A>and as a true lover of his country, now threatened by the greatest danger 
<A NAME="267"></A>in its history, to hold up his hand on the other side; to vote that the 
<A NAME="268"></A>Siceliots be left in the limits now existing between us, limits of which 
<A NAME="269"></A>no one can complain (the Ionian sea for the coasting voyage, and the Sicilian 
<A NAME="270"></A>across the open main), to enjoy their own possessions and to settle their 
<A NAME="271"></A>own quarrels; that the Egestaeans, for their part, be told to end by themselves 
<A NAME="272"></A>with the Selinuntines the war which they began without consulting the Athenians; 
<A NAME="273"></A>and that for the future we do not enter into alliance, as we have been 
<A NAME="274"></A>used to do, with people whom we must help in their need, and who can never 
<A NAME="275"></A>help us in ours.
<A NAME="276"></A><BR><BR>"And you, Prytanis, if you think it your duty to care for the commonwealth, 
<A NAME="277"></A>and if you wish to show yourself a good citizen, put the question to the 
<A NAME="278"></A>vote, and take a second time the opinions of the Athenians. If you are 
<A NAME="279"></A>afraid to move the question again, consider that a violation of the law 
<A NAME="280"></A>cannot carry any prejudice with so many abettors, that you will be the 
<A NAME="281"></A>physician of your misguided city, and that the virtue of men in office 
<A NAME="282"></A>is briefly this, to do their country as much good as they can, or in any 
<A NAME="283"></A>case no harm that they can avoid."
<A NAME="284"></A><BR><BR>Such were the words of Nicias. Most of the Athenians that came 
<A NAME="285"></A>forward spoke in favour of the expedition, and of not annulling what had 
<A NAME="286"></A>been voted, although some spoke on the other side. By far the warmest advocate 
<A NAME="287"></A>of the expedition was, however, Alcibiades, son of Clinias, who wished 
<A NAME="288"></A>to thwart Nicias both as his political opponent and also because of the 
<A NAME="289"></A>attack he had made upon him in his speech, and who was, besides, exceedingly 
<A NAME="290"></A>ambitious of a command by which he hoped to reduce Sicily and Carthage, 
<A NAME="291"></A>and personally to gain in wealth and reputation by means of his successes. 
<A NAME="292"></A>For the position he held among the citizens led him to indulge his tastes 
<A NAME="293"></A>beyond what his real means would bear, both in keeping horses and in the 
<A NAME="294"></A>rest of his expenditure; and this later on had not a little to do with 
<A NAME="295"></A>the ruin of the Athenian state. Alarmed at the greatness of his licence 
<A NAME="296"></A>in his own life and habits, and of the ambition which he showed in all 
<A NAME="297"></A>things soever that he undertook, the mass of the people set him down as 
<A NAME="298"></A>a pretender to the tyranny, and became his enemies; and although publicly 
<A NAME="299"></A>his conduct of the war was as good as could be desired, individually, his 
<A NAME="300"></A>habits gave offence to every one, and caused them to commit affairs to 
<A NAME="301"></A>other hands, and thus before long to ruin the city. Meanwhile he now came 
<A NAME="302"></A>forward and gave the following advice to the Athenians:
<A NAME="303"></A><BR><BR>"Athenians, I have a better right to command than others- I must 
<A NAME="304"></A>begin with this as Nicias has attacked me- and at the same time I believe 
<A NAME="305"></A>myself to be worthy of it. The things for which I am abused, bring fame 
<A NAME="306"></A>to my ancestors and to myself, and to the country profit besides. The Hellenes, 
<A NAME="307"></A>after expecting to see our city ruined by the war, concluded it to be even 
<A NAME="308"></A>greater than it really is, by reason of the magnificence with which I represented 
<A NAME="309"></A>it at the Olympic games, when I sent into the lists seven chariots, a number 
<A NAME="310"></A>never before entered by any private person, and won the first prize, and 
<A NAME="311"></A>was second and fourth, and took care to have everything else in a style 
<A NAME="312"></A>worthy of my victory. Custom regards such displays as honourable, and they 
<A NAME="313"></A>cannot be made without leaving behind them an impression of power. Again, 
<A NAME="314"></A>any splendour that I may have exhibited at home in providing choruses or 
<A NAME="315"></A>otherwise, is naturally envied by my fellow citizens, but in the eyes of 
<A NAME="316"></A>foreigners has an air of strength as in the other instance. And this is 
<A NAME="317"></A>no useless folly, when a man at his own private cost benefits not himself 
<A NAME="318"></A>only, but his city: nor is it unfair that he who prides himself on his 
<A NAME="319"></A>position should refuse to be upon an equality with the rest. He who is 
<A NAME="320"></A>badly off has his misfortunes all to himself, and as we do not see men 
<A NAME="321"></A>courted in adversity, on the like principle a man ought to accept the insolence 
<A NAME="322"></A>of prosperity; or else, let him first mete out equal measure to all, and 
<A NAME="323"></A>then demand to have it meted out to him. What I know is that persons of 
<A NAME="324"></A>this kind and all others that have attained to any distinction, although 
<A NAME="325"></A>they may be unpopular in their lifetime in their relations with their fellow-men 
<A NAME="326"></A>and especially with their equals, leave to posterity the desire of claiming 
<A NAME="327"></A>connection with them even without any ground, and are vaunted by the country 
<A NAME="328"></A>to which they belonged, not as strangers or ill-doers, but as fellow-countrymen 
<A NAME="329"></A>and heroes. Such are my aspirations, and however I am abused for them in 
<A NAME="330"></A>private, the question is whether any one manages public affairs better 
<A NAME="331"></A>than I do. Having united the most powerful states of Peloponnese, without 
<A NAME="332"></A>great danger or expense to you, I compelled the Lacedaemonians to stake 
<A NAME="333"></A>their all upon the issue of a single day at Mantinea; and although victorious 
<A NAME="334"></A>in the battle, they have never since fully recovered 
<A NAME="335"></A>confidence.
<A NAME="336"></A><BR><BR>"Thus did my youth and so-called monstrous folly find fitting arguments 
<A NAME="337"></A>to deal with the power of the Peloponnesians, and by its ardour win their 
<A NAME="338"></A>confidence and prevail. And do not be afraid of my youth now, but while 
<A NAME="339"></A>I am still in its flower, and Nicias appears fortunate, avail yourselves 
<A NAME="340"></A>to the utmost of the services of us both. Neither rescind your resolution 
<A NAME="341"></A>to sail to Sicily, on the ground that you would be going to attack a great 
<A NAME="342"></A>power. The cities in Sicily are peopled by motley rabbles, and easily change 
<A NAME="343"></A>their institutions and adopt new ones in their stead; and consequently 
<A NAME="344"></A>the inhabitants, being without any feeling of patriotism, are not provided 
<A NAME="345"></A>with arms for their persons, and have not regularly established themselves 
<A NAME="346"></A>on the land; every man thinks that either by fair words or by party strife 
<A NAME="347"></A>he can obtain something at the public expense, and then in the event of 
<A NAME="348"></A>a catastrophe settle in some other country, and makes his preparations 
<A NAME="349"></A>accordingly. From a mob like this you need not look for either unanimity 
<A NAME="350"></A>in counsel or concert in action; but they will probably one by one come 
<A NAME="351"></A>in as they get a fair offer, especially if they are torn by civil strife 
<A NAME="352"></A>as we are told. Moreover, the Siceliots have not so many heavy infantry 
<A NAME="353"></A>as they boast; just as the Hellenes generally did not prove so numerous 
<A NAME="354"></A>as each state reckoned itself, but Hellas greatly over-estimated their 
<A NAME="355"></A>numbers, and has hardly had an adequate force of heavy infantry throughout 
<A NAME="356"></A>this war. The states in Sicily, therefore, from all that I can hear, will 
<A NAME="357"></A>be found as I say, and I have not pointed out all our advantages, for we 
<A NAME="358"></A>shall have the help of many barbarians, who from their hatred of the Syracusans 
<A NAME="359"></A>will join us in attacking them; nor will the powers at home prove any hindrance, 
<A NAME="360"></A>if you judge rightly. Our fathers with these very adversaries, which it 
<A NAME="361"></A>is said we shall now leave behind us when we sail, and the Mede as their 
<A NAME="362"></A>enemy as well, were able to win the empire, depending solely on their superiority 
<A NAME="363"></A>at sea. The Peloponnesians had never so little hope against us as at present; 
<A NAME="364"></A>and let them be ever so sanguine, although strong enough to invade our 
<A NAME="365"></A>country even if we stay at home, they can never hurt us with their navy, 
<A NAME="366"></A>as we leave one of our own behind us that is a match for 
<A NAME="367"></A>them.
<A NAME="368"></A><BR><BR>"In this state of things what reason can we give to ourselves for 
<A NAME="369"></A>holding back, or what excuse can we offer to our allies in Sicily for not 
<A NAME="370"></A>helping them? They are our confederates, and we are bound to assist them, 
<A NAME="371"></A>without objecting that they have not assisted us. We did not take them 
<A NAME="372"></A>into alliance to have them to help us in Hellas, but that they might so 
<A NAME="373"></A>annoy our enemies in Sicily as to prevent them from coming over here and 
<A NAME="374"></A>attacking us. It is thus that empire has been won, both by us and by all 
<A NAME="375"></A>others that have held it, by a constant readiness to support all, whether 
<A NAME="376"></A>barbarians or Hellenes, that invite assistance; since if all were to keep 
<A NAME="377"></A>quiet or to pick and choose whom they ought to assist, we should make but 
<A NAME="378"></A>few new conquests, and should imperil those we have already won. Men do 
<A NAME="379"></A>not rest content with parrying the attacks of a superior, but often strike 
<A NAME="380"></A>the first blow to prevent the attack being made. And we cannot fix the 
<A NAME="381"></A>exact point at which our empire shall stop; we have reached a position 
<A NAME="382"></A>in which we must not be content with retaining but must scheme to extend 
<A NAME="383"></A>it, for, if we cease to rule others, we are in danger of being ruled ourselves. 
<A NAME="384"></A>Nor can you look at inaction from the same point of view as others, unless 
<A NAME="385"></A>you are prepared to change your habits and make them like 
<A NAME="386"></A>theirs.
<A NAME="387"></A><BR><BR>"Be convinced, then, that we shall augment our power at home by 
<A NAME="388"></A>this adventure abroad, and let us make the expedition, and so humble the 
<A NAME="389"></A>pride of the Peloponnesians by sailing off to Sicily, and letting them 
<A NAME="390"></A>see how little we care for the peace that we are now enjoying; and at the 
<A NAME="391"></A>same time we shall either become masters, as we very easily may, of the 
<A NAME="392"></A>whole of Hellas through the accession of the Sicilian Hellenes, or in any 
<A NAME="393"></A>case ruin the Syracusans, to the no small advantage of ourselves and our 
<A NAME="394"></A>allies. The faculty of staying if successful, or of returning, will be 
<A NAME="395"></A>secured to us by our navy, as we shall be superior at sea to all the Siceliots 
<A NAME="396"></A>put together. And do not let the do-nothing policy which Nicias advocates, 
<A NAME="397"></A>or his setting of the young against the old, turn you from your purpose, 
<A NAME="398"></A>but in the good old fashion by which our fathers, old and young together, 
<A NAME="399"></A>by their united counsels brought our affairs to their present height, do 
<A NAME="400"></A>you endeavour still to advance them; understanding that neither youth nor 
<A NAME="401"></A>old age can do anything the one without the other, but that levity, sobriety, 
<A NAME="402"></A>and deliberate judgment are strongest when united, and that, by sinking 
<A NAME="403"></A>into inaction, the city, like everything else, will wear itself out, and 
<A NAME="404"></A>its skill in everything decay; while each fresh struggle will give it fresh 
<A NAME="405"></A>experience, and make it more used to defend itself not in word but in deed. 
<A NAME="406"></A>In short, my conviction is that a city not inactive by nature could not 
<A NAME="407"></A>choose a quicker way to ruin itself than by suddenly adopting such a policy, 
<A NAME="408"></A>and that the safest rule of life is to take one's character and institutions 
<A NAME="409"></A>for better and for worse, and to live up to them as closely as one 
<A NAME="410"></A>can."
<A NAME="411"></A><BR><BR>Such were the words of Alcibiades. After hearing him and the Egestaeans 
<A NAME="412"></A>and some Leontine exiles, who came forward reminding them of their oaths 
<A NAME="413"></A>and imploring their assistance, the Athenians became more eager for the 
<A NAME="414"></A>expedition than before. Nicias, perceiving that it would be now useless 
<A NAME="415"></A>to try to deter them by the old line of argument, but thinking that he 
<A NAME="416"></A>might perhaps alter their resolution by the extravagance of his estimates, 
<A NAME="417"></A>came forward a second time and spoke as follows:
<A NAME="418"></A><BR><BR>"I see, Athenians, that you are thoroughly bent upon the expedition, 
<A NAME="419"></A>and therefore hope that all will turn out as we wish, and proceed to give 
<A NAME="420"></A>you my opinion at the present juncture. From all that I hear we are going 
<A NAME="421"></A>against cities that are great and not subject to one another, or in need 
<A NAME="422"></A>of change, so as to be glad to pass from enforced servitude to an easier 
<A NAME="423"></A>condition, or in the least likely to accept our rule in exchange for freedom; 
<A NAME="424"></A>and, to take only the Hellenic towns, they are very numerous for one island. 
<A NAME="425"></A>Besides Naxos and Catana, which I expect to join us from their connection 
<A NAME="426"></A>with Leontini, there are seven others armed at all points just like our 
<A NAME="427"></A>own power, particularly Selinus and Syracuse, the chief objects of our 
<A NAME="428"></A>expedition. These are full of heavy infantry, archers, and darters, have 
<A NAME="429"></A>galleys in abundance and crowds to man them; they have also money, partly 
<A NAME="430"></A>in the hands of private persons, partly in the temples at Selinus, and 
<A NAME="431"></A>at Syracuse first-fruits from some of the barbarians as well. But their 
<A NAME="432"></A>chief advantage over us lies in the number of their horses, and in the 
<A NAME="433"></A>fact that they grow their corn at home instead of importing 
<A NAME="434"></A>it.
<A NAME="435"></A><BR><BR>"Against a power of this kind it will not do to have merely a weak 
<A NAME="436"></A>naval armament, but we shall want also a large land army to sail with us, 
<A NAME="437"></A>if we are to do anything worthy of our ambition, and are not to be shut 
<A NAME="438"></A>out from the country by a numerous cavalry; especially if the cities should 
<A NAME="439"></A>take alarm and combine, and we should be left without friends (except the 
<A NAME="440"></A>Egestaeans) to furnish us with horse to defend ourselves with. It would 
<A NAME="441"></A>be disgraceful to have to retire under compulsion, or to send back for 
<A NAME="442"></A>reinforcements, owing to want of reflection at first: we must therefore 
<A NAME="443"></A>start from home with a competent force, seeing that we are going to sail 
<A NAME="444"></A>far from our country, and upon an expedition not like any which you may 
<A NAME="445"></A>undertaken undertaken the quality of allies, among your subject states 
<A NAME="446"></A>here in Hellas, where any additional supplies needed were easily drawn 
<A NAME="447"></A>from the friendly territory; but we are cutting ourselves off, and going 
<A NAME="448"></A>to a land entirely strange, from which during four months in winter it 
<A NAME="449"></A>is not even easy for a messenger get to Athens.
<A NAME="450"></A><BR><BR>"I think, therefore, that we ought to take great numbers of heavy 
<A NAME="451"></A>infantry, both from Athens and from our allies, and not merely from our 
<A NAME="452"></A>subjects, but also any we may be able to get for love or for money in Peloponnese, 
<A NAME="453"></A>and great numbers also of archers and slingers, to make head against the 
<A NAME="454"></A>Sicilian horse. Meanwhile we must have an overwhelming superiority at sea, 
<A NAME="455"></A>to enable us the more easily to carry in what we want; and we must take 
<A NAME="456"></A>our own corn in merchant vessels, that is to say, wheat and parched barley, 
<A NAME="457"></A>and bakers from the mills compelled to serve for pay in the proper proportion; 
<A NAME="458"></A>in order that in case of our being weather-bound the armament may not want 
<A NAME="459"></A>provisions, as it is not every city that will be able to entertain numbers 
<A NAME="460"></A>like ours. We must also provide ourselves with everything else as far as 
<A NAME="461"></A>we can, so as not to be dependent upon others; and above all we must take 
<A NAME="462"></A>with us from home as much money as possible, as the sums talked of as ready 
<A NAME="463"></A>at Egesta are readier, you may be sure, in talk than in any other 
<A NAME="464"></A>way.
<A NAME="465"></A><BR><BR>"Indeed, even if we leave Athens with a force not only equal to 
<A NAME="466"></A>that of the enemy except in the number of heavy infantry in the field, 
<A NAME="467"></A>but even at all points superior to him, we shall still find it difficult 
<A NAME="468"></A>to conquer Sicily or save ourselves. We must not disguise from ourselves 
<A NAME="469"></A>that we go to found a city among strangers and enemies, and that he who 
<A NAME="470"></A>undertakes such an enterprise should be prepared to become master of the 
<A NAME="471"></A>country the first day he lands, or failing in this to find everything hostile 
<A NAME="472"></A>to him. Fearing this, and knowing that we shall have need of much good 
<A NAME="473"></A>counsel and more good fortune- a hard matter for mortal man to aspire to- 
<A NAME="474"></A>I wish as far as may be to make myself independent of fortune before sailing, 
<A NAME="475"></A>and when I do sail, to be as safe as a strong force can make me. This I 
<A NAME="476"></A>believe to be surest for the country at large, and safest for us who are 
<A NAME="477"></A>to go on the expedition. If any one thinks differently I resign to him 
<A NAME="478"></A>my command."
<A NAME="479"></A><BR><BR>With this Nicias concluded, thinking that he should either disgust 
<A NAME="480"></A>the Athenians by the magnitude of the undertaking, or, if obliged to sail 
<A NAME="481"></A>on the expedition, would thus do so in the safest way possible. The Athenians, 
<A NAME="482"></A>however, far from having their taste for the voyage taken away by the burdensomeness 
<A NAME="483"></A>of the preparations, became more eager for it than ever; and just the contrary 
<A NAME="484"></A>took place of what Nicias had thought, as it was held that he had given 
<A NAME="485"></A>good advice, and that the expedition would be the safest in the world. 
<A NAME="486"></A>All alike fell in love with the enterprise. The older men thought that 
<A NAME="487"></A>they would either subdue the places against which they were to sail, or 
<A NAME="488"></A>at all events, with so large a force, meet with no disaster; those in the 
<A NAME="489"></A>prime of life felt a longing for foreign sights and spectacles, and had 
<A NAME="490"></A>no doubt that they should come safe home again; while the idea of the common 
<A NAME="491"></A>people and the soldiery was to earn wages at the moment, and make conquests 
<A NAME="492"></A>that would supply a never-ending fund of pay for the future. With this 
<A NAME="493"></A>enthusiasm of the majority, the few that liked it not, feared to appear 
<A NAME="494"></A>unpatriotic by holding up their hands against it, and so kept 
<A NAME="495"></A>quiet.
<A NAME="496"></A><BR><BR>At last one of the Athenians came forward and called upon Nicias 
<A NAME="497"></A>and told him that he ought not to make excuses or put them off, but say 
<A NAME="498"></A>at once before them all what forces the Athenians should vote him. Upon 
<A NAME="499"></A>this he said, not without reluctance, that he would advise upon that matter 
<A NAME="500"></A>more at leisure with his colleagues; as far however as he could see at 
<A NAME="501"></A>present, they must sail with at least one hundred galleys- the Athenians 
<A NAME="502"></A>providing as many transports as they might determine, and sending for others 
<A NAME="503"></A>from the allies- not less than five thousand heavy infantry in all, Athenian 
<A NAME="504"></A>and allied, and if possible more; and the rest of the armament in proportion; 
<A NAME="505"></A>archers from home and from Crete, and slingers, and whatever else might 
<A NAME="506"></A>seem desirable, being got ready by the generals and taken with 
<A NAME="507"></A>them.
<A NAME="508"></A><BR><BR>Upon hearing this the Athenians at once voted that the generals 
<A NAME="509"></A>should have full powers in the matter of the numbers of the army and of 
<A NAME="510"></A>the expedition generally, to do as they judged best for the interests of 
<A NAME="511"></A>Athens. After this the preparations began; messages being sent to the allies 
<A NAME="512"></A>and the rolls drawn up at home. And as the city had just recovered from 
<A NAME="513"></A>the plague and the long war, and a number of young men had grown up and 
<A NAME="514"></A>capital had accumulated by reason of the truce, everything was the more 
<A NAME="515"></A>easily provided.
<A NAME="516"></A><BR><BR>In the midst of these preparations all the stone Hermae in the 
<A NAME="517"></A>city of Athens, that is to say the customary square figures, so common 
<A NAME="518"></A>in the doorways of private houses and temples, had in one night most of 
<A NAME="519"></A>them their fares mutilated. No one knew who had done it, but large public 
<A NAME="520"></A>rewards were offered to find the authors; and it was further voted that 
<A NAME="521"></A>any one who knew of any other act of impiety having been committed should 
<A NAME="522"></A>come and give information without fear of consequences, whether he were 
<A NAME="523"></A>citizen, alien, or slave. The matter was taken up the more seriously, as 
<A NAME="524"></A>it was thought to be ominous for the expedition, and part of a conspiracy 
<A NAME="525"></A>to bring about a revolution and to upset the democracy.
<A NAME="526"></A><BR><BR>Information was given accordingly by some resident aliens and body 
<A NAME="527"></A>servants, not about the Hermae but about some previous mutilations of other 
<A NAME="528"></A>images perpetrated by young men in a drunken frolic, and of mock celebrations 
<A NAME="529"></A>of the mysteries, averred to take place in private houses. Alcibiades being 
<A NAME="530"></A>implicated in this charge, it was taken hold of by those who could least 
<A NAME="531"></A>endure him, because he stood in the way of their obtaining the undisturbed 
<A NAME="532"></A>direction of the people, and who thought that if he were once removed the 
<A NAME="533"></A>first place would be theirs. These accordingly magnified the matter and 
<A NAME="534"></A>loudly proclaimed that the affair of the mysteries and the mutilation of 
<A NAME="535"></A>the Hermae were part and parcel of a scheme to overthrow the democracy, 
<A NAME="536"></A>and that nothing of all this had been done without Alcibiades; the proofs 
<A NAME="537"></A>alleged being the general and undemocratic licence of his life and 
<A NAME="538"></A>habits.
<A NAME="539"></A><BR><BR>Alcibiades repelled on the spot the charges in question, and also 
<A NAME="540"></A>before going on the expedition, the preparations for which were now complete, 
<A NAME="541"></A>offered to stand his trial, that it might be seen whether he was guilty 
<A NAME="542"></A>of the acts imputed to him; desiring to be punished if found guilty, but, 
<A NAME="543"></A>if acquitted, to take the command. Meanwhile he protested against their 
<A NAME="544"></A>receiving slanders against him in his absence, and begged them rather to 
<A NAME="545"></A>put him to death at once if he were guilty, and pointed out the imprudence 
<A NAME="546"></A>of sending him out at the head of so large an army, with so serious a charge 
<A NAME="547"></A>still undecided. But his enemies feared that he would have the army for 
<A NAME="548"></A>him if he were tried immediately, and that the people might relent in favour 
<A NAME="549"></A>of the man whom they already caressed as the cause of the Argives and some 
<A NAME="550"></A>of the Mantineans joining in the expedition, and did their utmost to get 
<A NAME="551"></A>this proposition rejected, putting forward other orators who said that 
<A NAME="552"></A>he ought at present to sail and not delay the departure of the army, and 
<A NAME="553"></A>be tried on his return within a fixed number of days; their plan being 
<A NAME="554"></A>to have him sent for and brought home for trial upon some graver charge, 
<A NAME="555"></A>which they would the more easily get up in his absence. Accordingly it 
<A NAME="556"></A>was decreed that he should sail.
<A NAME="557"></A><BR><BR>After this the departure for Sicily took place, it being now about 
<A NAME="558"></A>midsummer. Most of the allies, with the corn transports and the smaller 
<A NAME="559"></A>craft and the rest of the expedition, had already received orders to muster 
<A NAME="560"></A>at Corcyra, to cross the Ionian Sea from thence in a body to the Iapygian 
<A NAME="561"></A>promontory. But the Athenians themselves, and such of their allies as happened 
<A NAME="562"></A>to be with them, went down to Piraeus upon a day appointed at daybreak, 
<A NAME="563"></A>and began to man the ships for putting out to sea. With them also went 
<A NAME="564"></A>down the whole population, one may say, of the city, both citizens and 
<A NAME="565"></A>foreigners; the inhabitants of the country each escorting those that belonged 
<A NAME="566"></A>to them, their friends, their relatives, or their sons, with hope and lamentation 
<A NAME="567"></A>upon their way, as they thought of the conquests which they hoped to make, 
<A NAME="568"></A>or of the friends whom they might never see again, considering the long 
<A NAME="569"></A>voyage which they were going to make from their country. Indeed, at this 
<A NAME="570"></A>moment, when they were now upon the point of parting from one another, 
<A NAME="571"></A>the danger came more home to them than when they voted for the expedition; 
<A NAME="572"></A>although the strength of the armament, and the profuse provision which 
<A NAME="573"></A>they remarked in every department, was a sight that could not but comfort 
<A NAME="574"></A>them. As for the foreigners and the rest of the crowd, they simply went 
<A NAME="575"></A>to see a sight worth looking at and passing all belief.
<A NAME="576"></A><BR><BR>Indeed this armament that first sailed out was by far the most 
<A NAME="577"></A>costly and splendid Hellenic force that had ever been sent out by a single 
<A NAME="578"></A>city up to that time. In mere number of ships and heavy infantry that against 
<A NAME="579"></A>Epidaurus under Pericles, and the same when going against Potidaea under 
<A NAME="580"></A>Hagnon, was not inferior; containing as it did four thousand Athenian heavy 
<A NAME="581"></A>infantry, three hundred horse, and one hundred galleys accompanied by fifty 
<A NAME="582"></A>Lesbian and Chian vessels and many allies besides. But these were sent 
<A NAME="583"></A>upon a short voyage and with a scanty equipment. The present expedition 
<A NAME="584"></A>was formed in contemplation of a long term of service by land and sea alike, 
<A NAME="585"></A>and was furnished with ships and troops so as to be ready for either as 
<A NAME="586"></A>required. The fleet had been elaborately equipped at great cost to the 
<A NAME="587"></A>captains and the state; the treasury giving a drachma a day to each seaman, 
<A NAME="588"></A>and providing empty ships, sixty men-of-war and forty transports, and manning 
<A NAME="589"></A>these with the best crews obtainable; while the captains gave a bounty 
<A NAME="590"></A>in addition to the pay from the treasury to the thranitae and crews generally, 
<A NAME="591"></A>besides spending lavishly upon figure-heads and equipments, and one and 
<A NAME="592"></A>all making the utmost exertions to enable their own ships to excel in beauty 
<A NAME="593"></A>and fast sailing. Meanwhile the land forces had been picked from the best 
<A NAME="594"></A>muster-rolls, and vied with each other in paying great attention to their 
<A NAME="595"></A>arms and personal accoutrements. From this resulted not only a rivalry 
<A NAME="596"></A>among themselves in their different departments, but an idea among the 
<A NAME="597"></A>rest of the Hellenes that it was more a display of power and resources 
<A NAME="598"></A>than an armament against an enemy. For if any one had counted up the public 
<A NAME="599"></A>expenditure of the state, and the private outlay of individuals- that is 
<A NAME="600"></A>to say, the sums which the state had already spent upon the expedition 
<A NAME="601"></A>and was sending out in the hands of the generals, and those which individuals 
<A NAME="602"></A>had expended upon their personal outfit, or as captains of galleys had 
<A NAME="603"></A>laid out and were still to lay out upon their vessels; and if he had added 
<A NAME="604"></A>to this the journey money which each was likely to have provided himself 
<A NAME="605"></A>with, independently of the pay from the treasury, for a voyage of such 
<A NAME="606"></A>length, and what the soldiers or traders took with them for the purpose 
<A NAME="607"></A>of exchange- it would have been found that many talents in all were being 
<A NAME="608"></A>taken out of the city. Indeed the expedition became not less famous for 
<A NAME="609"></A>its wonderful boldness and for the splendour of its appearance, than for 
<A NAME="610"></A>its overwhelming strength as compared with the peoples against whom it 
<A NAME="611"></A>was directed, and for the fact that this was the longest passage from home 
<A NAME="612"></A>hitherto attempted, and the most ambitious in its objects considering the 
<A NAME="613"></A>resources of those who undertook it.
<A NAME="614"></A><BR><BR>The ships being now manned, and everything put on board with which 
<A NAME="615"></A>they meant to sail, the trumpet commanded silence, and the prayers customary 
<A NAME="616"></A>before putting out to sea were offered, not in each ship by itself, but 
<A NAME="617"></A>by all together to the voice of a herald; and bowls of wine were mixed 
<A NAME="618"></A>through all the armament, and libations made by the soldiers and their 
<A NAME="619"></A>officers in gold and silver goblets. In their prayers joined also the crowds 
<A NAME="620"></A>on shore, the citizens and all others that wished them well. The hymn sung 
<A NAME="621"></A>and the libations finished, they put out to sea, and first out in column 
<A NAME="622"></A>then raced each other as far as Aegina, and so hastened to reach Corcyra, 
<A NAME="623"></A>where the rest of the allied forces were also assembling.

<A NAME="624"></A><B>Chapter XIX</B>

<A NAME="625"></A><BR><BR><B>Seventeenth Year of the War - Parties at Syracuse</B> <B>- Story 
<A NAME="626"></A>of Harmodius and Aristogiton -</B> <B>Disgrace of Alcibiades</B>
<A NAME="627"></A><BR><BR>Meanwhile at Syracuse news came in from many quarters of the expedition, 
<A NAME="628"></A>but for a long while met with no credence whatever. Indeed, an assembly 
<A NAME="629"></A>was held in which speeches, as will be seen, were delivered by different 
<A NAME="630"></A>orators, believing or contradicting the report of the Athenian expedition; 
<A NAME="631"></A>among whom Hermocrates, son of Hermon, came forward, being persuaded that 
<A NAME="632"></A>he knew the truth of the matter, and gave the following 
<A NAME="633"></A>counsel:
<A NAME="634"></A><BR><BR>"Although I shall perhaps be no better believed than others have 
<A NAME="635"></A>been when I speak upon the reality of the expedition, and although I know 
<A NAME="636"></A>that those who either make or repeat statements thought not worthy of belief 
<A NAME="637"></A>not only gain no converts but are thought fools for their pains, I shall 
<A NAME="638"></A>certainly not be frightened into holding my tongue when the state is in 
<A NAME="639"></A>danger, and when I am persuaded that I can speak with more authority on 
<A NAME="640"></A>the matter than other persons. Much as you wonder at it, the Athenians 
<A NAME="641"></A>nevertheless have set out against us with a large force, naval and military, 
<A NAME="642"></A>professedly to help the Egestaeans and to restore Leontini, but really 
<A NAME="643"></A>to conquer Sicily, and above all our city, which once gained, the rest, 
<A NAME="644"></A>they think, will easily follow. Make up your minds, therefore, to see them 
<A NAME="645"></A>speedily here, and see how you can best repel them with the means under 
<A NAME="646"></A>your hand, and do be taken off your guard through despising the news, or 
<A NAME="647"></A>neglect the common weal through disbelieving it. Meanwhile those who believe 
<A NAME="648"></A>me need not be dismayed at the force or daring of the enemy. They will 
<A NAME="649"></A>not be able to do us more hurt than we shall do them; nor is the greatness 
<A NAME="650"></A>of their armament altogether without advantage to us. Indeed, the greater 
<A NAME="651"></A>it is the better, with regard to the rest of the Siceliots, whom dismay 
<A NAME="652"></A>will make more ready to join us; and if we defeat or drive them away, disappointed 
<A NAME="653"></A>of the objects of their ambition (for I do not fear for a moment that they 
<A NAME="654"></A>will get what they want), it will be a most glorious exploit for us, and 
<A NAME="655"></A>in my judgment by no means an unlikely one. Few indeed have been the large 
<A NAME="656"></A>armaments, either Hellenic or barbarian, that have gone far from home and 
<A NAME="657"></A>been successful. They cannot be more numerous than the people of the country 
<A NAME="658"></A>and their neighbours, all of whom fear leagues together; and if they miscarry 
<A NAME="659"></A>for want of supplies in a foreign land, to those against whom their plans 
<A NAME="660"></A>were laid none the less they leave renown, although they may themselves 
<A NAME="661"></A>have been the main cause of their own discomfort. Thus these very Athenians 
<A NAME="662"></A>rose by the defeat of the Mede, in a great measure due to accidental causes, 
<A NAME="663"></A>from the mere fact that Athens had been the object of his attack; and this 
<A NAME="664"></A>may very well be the case with us also.
<A NAME="665"></A><BR><BR>"Let us, therefore, confidently begin preparations here; let us 
<A NAME="666"></A>send and confirm some of the Sicels, and obtain the friendship and alliance 
<A NAME="667"></A>of others, and dispatch envoys to the rest of Sicily to show that the danger 
<A NAME="668"></A>is common to all, and to Italy to get them to become our allies, or at 
<A NAME="669"></A>all events to refuse to receive the Athenians. I also think that it would 
<A NAME="670"></A>be best to send to Carthage as well; they are by no means there without 
<A NAME="671"></A>apprehension, but it is their constant fear that the Athenians may one 
<A NAME="672"></A>day attack their city, and they may perhaps think that they might themselves 
<A NAME="673"></A>suffer by letting Sicily be sacrificed, and be willing to help us secretly 
<A NAME="674"></A>if not openly, in one way if not in another. They are the best able to 
<A NAME="675"></A>do so, if they will, of any of the present day, as they possess most gold 
<A NAME="676"></A>and silver, by which war, like everything else, flourishes. Let us also 
<A NAME="677"></A>send to Lacedaemon and Corinth, and ask them to come here and help us as 
<A NAME="678"></A>soon as possible, and to keep alive the war in Hellas. But the true thing 
<A NAME="679"></A>of all others, in my opinion, to do at the present moment, is what you, 
<A NAME="680"></A>with your constitutional love of quiet, will be slow to see, and what I 
<A NAME="681"></A>must nevertheless mention. If we Siceliots, all together, or at least as 
<A NAME="682"></A>many as possible besides ourselves, would only launch the whole of our 
<A NAME="683"></A>actual navy with two months' provisions, and meet the Athenians at Tarentum 
<A NAME="684"></A>and the Iapygian promontory, and show them that before fighting for Sicily 
<A NAME="685"></A>they must first fight for their passage across the Ionian Sea, we should 
<A NAME="686"></A>strike dismay into their army, and set them on thinking that we have a 
<A NAME="687"></A>base for our defensive- for Tarentum is ready to receive us- while they 
<A NAME="688"></A>have a wide sea to cross with all their armament, which could with difficulty 
<A NAME="689"></A>keep its order through so long a voyage, and would be easy for us to attack 
<A NAME="690"></A>as it came on slowly and in small detachments. On the other hand, if they 
<A NAME="691"></A>were to lighten their vessels, and draw together their fast sailers and 
<A NAME="692"></A>with these attack us, we could either fall upon them when they were wearied 
<A NAME="693"></A>with rowing, or if we did not choose to do so, we could retire to Tarentum; 
<A NAME="694"></A>while they, having crossed with few provisions just to give battle, would 
<A NAME="695"></A>be hard put to it in desolate places, and would either have to remain and 
<A NAME="696"></A>be blockaded, or to try to sail along the coast, abandoning the rest of 
<A NAME="697"></A>their armament, and being further discouraged by not knowing for certain 
<A NAME="698"></A>whether the cities would receive them. In my opinion this consideration 
<A NAME="699"></A>alone would be sufficient to deter them from putting out from Corcyra; 
<A NAME="700"></A>and what with deliberating and reconnoitring our numbers and whereabouts, 
<A NAME="701"></A>they would let the season go on until winter was upon them, or, confounded 
<A NAME="702"></A>by so unexpected a circumstance, would break up the expedition, especially 
<A NAME="703"></A>as their most experienced general has, as I hear, taken the command against 
<A NAME="704"></A>his will, and would grasp at the first excuse offered by any serious demonstration 
<A NAME="705"></A>of ours. We should also be reported, I am certain, as more numerous than 
<A NAME="706"></A>we really are, and men's minds are affected by what they hear, and besides 
<A NAME="707"></A>the first to attack, or to show that they mean to defend themselves against 
<A NAME="708"></A>an attack, inspire greater fear because men see that they are ready for 
<A NAME="709"></A>the emergency. This would just be the case with the Athenians at present. 
<A NAME="710"></A>They are now attacking us in the belief that we shall not resist, having 
<A NAME="711"></A>a right to judge us severely because we did not help the Lacedaemonians 
<A NAME="712"></A>in crushing them; but if they were to see us showing a courage for which 
<A NAME="713"></A>they are not prepared, they would be more dismayed by the surprise than 
<A NAME="714"></A>they could ever be by our actual power. I could wish to persuade you to 
<A NAME="715"></A>show this courage; but if this cannot be, at all events lose not a moment 
<A NAME="716"></A>in preparing generally for the war; and remember all of you that contempt 
<A NAME="717"></A>for an assailant is best shown by bravery in action, but that for the present 
<A NAME="718"></A>the best course is to accept the preparations which fear inspires as giving 
<A NAME="719"></A>the surest promise of safety, and to act as if the danger was real. That 
<A NAME="720"></A>the Athenians are coming to attack us, and are already upon the voyage, 
<A NAME="721"></A>and all but here- this is what I am sure of."
<A NAME="722"></A><BR><BR>Thus far spoke Hermocrates. Meanwhile the people of Syracuse were 
<A NAME="723"></A>at great strife among themselves; some contending that the Athenians had 
<A NAME="724"></A>no idea of coming and that there was no truth in what he said; some asking 
<A NAME="725"></A>if they did come what harm they could do that would not be repaid them 
<A NAME="726"></A>tenfold in return; while others made light of the whole affair and turned 
<A NAME="727"></A>it into ridicule. In short, there were few that believed Hermocrates and 
<A NAME="728"></A>feared for the future. Meanwhile Athenagoras, the leader of the people 
<A NAME="729"></A>and very powerful at that time with the masses, came forward and spoke 
<A NAME="730"></A>as follows:
<A NAME="731"></A><BR><BR>"For the Athenians, he who does not wish that they may be as misguided 
<A NAME="732"></A>as they are supposed to be, and that they may come here to become our subjects, 
<A NAME="733"></A>is either a coward or a traitor to his country; while as for those who 
<A NAME="734"></A>carry such tidings and fill you with so much alarm, I wonder less at their 
<A NAME="735"></A>audacity than at their folly if they flatter themselves that we do not 
<A NAME="736"></A>see through them. The fact is that they have their private reasons to be 
<A NAME="737"></A>afraid, and wish to throw the city into consternation to have their own 
<A NAME="738"></A>terrors cast into the shade by the public alarm. In short, this is what 
<A NAME="739"></A>these reports are worth; they do not arise of themselves, but are concocted 
<A NAME="740"></A>by men who are always causing agitation here in Sicily. However, if you 
<A NAME="741"></A>are well advised, you will not be guided in your calculation of probabilities 
<A NAME="742"></A>by what these persons tell you, but by what shrewd men and of large experience, 
<A NAME="743"></A>as I esteem the Athenians to be, would be likely to do. Now it is not likely 
<A NAME="744"></A>that they would leave the Peloponnesians behind them, and before they have 
<A NAME="745"></A>well ended the war in Hellas wantonly come in quest of a new war quite 
<A NAME="746"></A>as arduous in Sicily; indeed, in my judgment, they are only too glad that 
<A NAME="747"></A>we do not go and attack them, being so many and so great cities as we 
<A NAME="748"></A>are.
<A NAME="749"></A><BR><BR>"However, if they should come as is reported, I consider Sicily 
<A NAME="750"></A>better able to go through with the war than Peloponnese, as being at all 
<A NAME="751"></A>points better prepared, and our city by itself far more than a match for 
<A NAME="752"></A>this pretended army of invasion, even were it twice as large again. I know 
<A NAME="753"></A>that they will not have horses with them, or get any here, except a few 
<A NAME="754"></A>perhaps from the Egestaeans; or be able to bring a force of heavy infantry 
<A NAME="755"></A>equal in number to our own, in ships which will already have enough to 
<A NAME="756"></A>do to come all this distance, however lightly laden, not to speak of the 
<A NAME="757"></A>transport of the other stores required against a city of this magnitude, 
<A NAME="758"></A>which will be no slight quantity. In fact, so strong is my opinion upon 
<A NAME="759"></A>the subject, that I do not well see how they could avoid annihilation if 
<A NAME="760"></A>they brought with them another city as large as Syracuse, and settled down 
<A NAME="761"></A>and carried on war from our frontier; much less can they hope to succeed 
<A NAME="762"></A>with all Sicily hostile to them, as all Sicily will be, and with only a 
<A NAME="763"></A>camp pitched from the ships, and composed of tents and bare necessaries, 
<A NAME="764"></A>from which they would not be able to stir far for fear of our 
<A NAME="765"></A>cavalry.
<A NAME="766"></A><BR><BR>"But the Athenians see this as I tell you, and as I have reason 
<A NAME="767"></A>to know are looking after their possessions at home, while persons here 
<A NAME="768"></A>invent stories that neither are true nor ever will be. Nor is this the 
<A NAME="769"></A>first time that I see these persons, when they cannot resort to deeds, 
<A NAME="770"></A>trying by such stories and by others even more abominable to frighten your 
<A NAME="771"></A>people and get into their hands the government: it is what I see always. 
<A NAME="772"></A>And I cannot help fearing that trying so often they may one day succeed, 
<A NAME="773"></A>and that we, as long as we do not feel the smart, may prove too weak for 
<A NAME="774"></A>the task of prevention, or, when the offenders are known, of pursuit. The 
<A NAME="775"></A>result is that our city is rarely at rest, but is subject to constant troubles 
<A NAME="776"></A>and to contests as frequent against herself as against the enemy, not to 
<A NAME="777"></A>speak of occasional tyrannies and infamous cabals. However, I will try, 
<A NAME="778"></A>if you will support me, to let nothing of this happen in our time, by gaining 
<A NAME="779"></A>you, the many, and by chastising the authors of such machinations, not 
<A NAME="780"></A>merely when they are caught in the act- a difficult feat to accomplish- 
<A NAME="781"></A>but also for what they have the wish though not the power to do; as it 
<A NAME="782"></A>is necessary to punish an enemy not only for what he does, but also beforehand 
<A NAME="783"></A>for what he intends to do, if the first to relax precaution would not be 
<A NAME="784"></A>also the first to suffer. I shall also reprove, watch, and on occasion 
<A NAME="785"></A>warn the few- the most effectual way, in my opinion, of turning them from 
<A NAME="786"></A>their evil courses. And after all, as I have often asked, what would you 
<A NAME="787"></A>have, young men? Would you hold office at once? The law forbids it, a law 
<A NAME="788"></A>enacted rather because you are not competent than to disgrace you when 
<A NAME="789"></A>competent. Meanwhile you would not be on a legal equality with the many! 
<A NAME="790"></A>But how can it be right that citizens of the same state should be held 
<A NAME="791"></A>unworthy of the same privileges? "It will be said, perhaps, that democracy 
<A NAME="792"></A>is neither wise nor equitable, but that the holders of property are also 
<A NAME="793"></A>the best fitted to rule. I say, on the contrary, first, that the word demos, 
<A NAME="794"></A>or people, includes the whole state, oligarchy only a part; next, that 
<A NAME="795"></A>if the best guardians of property are the rich, and the best counsellors 
<A NAME="796"></A>the wise, none can hear and decide so well as the many; and that all these 
<A NAME="797"></A>talents, severally and collectively, have their just place in a democracy. 
<A NAME="798"></A>But an oligarchy gives the many their share of the danger, and not content 
<A NAME="799"></A>with the largest part takes and keeps the whole of the profit; and this 
<A NAME="800"></A>is what the powerful and young among you aspire to, but in a great city 
<A NAME="801"></A>cannot possibly obtain.
<A NAME="802"></A><BR><BR>"But even now, foolish men, most senseless of all the Hellenes 
<A NAME="803"></A>that I know, if you have no sense of the wickedness of your designs, or 
<A NAME="804"></A>most criminal if you have that sense and still dare to pursue them- even 
<A NAME="805"></A>now, if it is not a case for repentance, you may still learn wisdom, and 
<A NAME="806"></A>thus advance the interest of the country, the common interest of us all. 
<A NAME="807"></A>Reflect that in the country's prosperity the men of merit in your ranks 
<A NAME="808"></A>will have a share and a larger share than the great mass of your fellow 
<A NAME="809"></A>countrymen, but that if you have other designs you run a risk of being 
<A NAME="810"></A>deprived of all; and desist from reports like these, as the people know 
<A NAME="811"></A>your object and will not put up with it. If the Athenians arrive, this 
<A NAME="812"></A>city will repulse them in a manner worthy of itself; we have moreover, 
<A NAME="813"></A>generals who will see to this matter. And if nothing of this be true, as 
<A NAME="814"></A>I incline to believe, the city will not be thrown into a panic by your 
<A NAME="815"></A>intelligence, or impose upon itself a self-chosen servitude by choosing 
<A NAME="816"></A>you for its rulers; the city itself will look into the matter, and will 
<A NAME="817"></A>judge your words as if they were acts, and, instead of allowing itself 
<A NAME="818"></A>to be deprived of its liberty by listening to you, will strive to preserve 
<A NAME="819"></A>that liberty, by taking care to have always at hand the means of making 
<A NAME="820"></A>itself respected."
<A NAME="821"></A><BR><BR>Such were the words of Athenagoras. One of the generals now stood 
<A NAME="822"></A>up and stopped any other speakers coming forward, adding these words of 
<A NAME="823"></A>his own with reference to the matter in hand: "It is not well for speakers 
<A NAME="824"></A>to utter calumnies against one another, or for their hearers to entertain 
<A NAME="825"></A>them; we ought rather to look to the intelligence that we have received, 
<A NAME="826"></A>and see how each man by himself and the city as a whole may best prepare 
<A NAME="827"></A>to repel the invaders. Even if there be no need, there is no harm in the 
<A NAME="828"></A>state being furnished with horses and arms and all other insignia of war; 
<A NAME="829"></A>and we will undertake to see to and order this, and to send round to the 
<A NAME="830"></A>cities to reconnoitre and do all else that may appear desirable. Part of 
<A NAME="831"></A>this we have seen to already, and whatever we discover shall be laid before 
<A NAME="832"></A>you." After these words from the general, the Syracusans departed from 
<A NAME="833"></A>the assembly.
<A NAME="834"></A><BR><BR>In the meantime the Athenians with all their allies had now arrived 
<A NAME="835"></A>at Corcyra. Here the generals began by again reviewing the armament, and 
<A NAME="836"></A>made arrangements as to the order in which they were to anchor and encamp, 
<A NAME="837"></A>and dividing the whole fleet into three divisions, allotted one to each 
<A NAME="838"></A>of their number, to avoid sailing all together and being thus embarrassed 
<A NAME="839"></A>for water, harbourage, or provisions at the stations which they might touch 
<A NAME="840"></A>at, and at the same time to be generally better ordered and easier to handle, 
<A NAME="841"></A>by each squadron having its own commander. Next they sent on three ships 
<A NAME="842"></A>to Italy and Sicily to find out which of the cities would receive them, 
<A NAME="843"></A>with instructions to meet them on the way and let them know before they 
<A NAME="844"></A>put in to land.
<A NAME="845"></A><BR><BR>After this the Athenians weighed from Corcyra, and proceeded to 
<A NAME="846"></A>cross to Sicily with an armament now consisting of one hundred and thirty-four 
<A NAME="847"></A>galleys in all (besides two Rhodian fifty-oars), of which one hundred were 
<A NAME="848"></A>Athenian vessels- sixty men-of-war, and forty troopships- and the remainder 
<A NAME="849"></A>from Chios and the other allies; five thousand and one hundred heavy infantry 
<A NAME="850"></A>in all, that is to say, fifteen hundred Athenian citizens from the rolls 
<A NAME="851"></A>at Athens and seven hundred Thetes shipped as marines, and the rest allied 
<A NAME="852"></A>troops, some of them Athenian subjects, and besides these five hundred 
<A NAME="853"></A>Argives, and two hundred and fifty Mantineans serving for hire; four hundred 
<A NAME="854"></A>and eighty archers in all, eighty of whom were Cretans, seven hundred slingers 
<A NAME="855"></A>from Rhodes, one hundred and twenty light-armed exiles from Megara, and 
<A NAME="856"></A>one horse-transport carrying thirty horses.
<A NAME="857"></A><BR><BR>Such was the strength of the first armament that sailed over for 
<A NAME="858"></A>the war. The supplies for this force were carried by thirty ships of burden 
<A NAME="859"></A>laden with corn, which conveyed the bakers, stone-masons, and carpenters, 
<A NAME="860"></A>and the tools for raising fortifications, accompanied by one hundred boats, 
<A NAME="861"></A>like the former pressed into the service, besides many other boats and 
<A NAME="862"></A>ships of burden which followed the armament voluntarily for purposes of 
<A NAME="863"></A>trade; all of which now left Corcyra and struck across the Ionian Sea together. 
<A NAME="864"></A>The whole force making land at the Iapygian promontory and Tarentum, with 
<A NAME="865"></A>more or less good fortune, coasted along the shores of Italy, the cities 
<A NAME="866"></A>shutting their markets and gates against them, and according them nothing 
<A NAME="867"></A>but water and liberty to anchor, and Tarentum and Locri not even that, 
<A NAME="868"></A>until they arrived at Rhegium, the extreme point of Italy. Here at length 
<A NAME="869"></A>they reunited, and not gaining admission within the walls pitched a camp 
<A NAME="870"></A>outside the city in the precinct of Artemis, where a market was also provided 
<A NAME="871"></A>for them, and drew their ships on shore and kept quiet. Meanwhile they 
<A NAME="872"></A>opened negotiations with the Rhegians, and called upon them as Chalcidians 
<A NAME="873"></A>to assist their Leontine kinsmen; to which the Rhegians replied that they 
<A NAME="874"></A>would not side with either party, but should await the decision of the 
<A NAME="875"></A>rest of the Italiots, and do as they did. Upon this the Athenians now began 
<A NAME="876"></A>to consider what would be the best action to take in the affairs of Sicily, 
<A NAME="877"></A>and meanwhile waited for the ships sent on to come back from Egesta, in 
<A NAME="878"></A>order to know whether there was really there the money mentioned by the 
<A NAME="879"></A>messengers at Athens.
<A NAME="880"></A><BR><BR>In the meantime came in from all quarters to the Syracusans, as 
<A NAME="881"></A>well as from their own officers sent to reconnoitre, the positive tidings 
<A NAME="882"></A>that the fleet was at Rhegium; upon which they laid aside their incredulity 
<A NAME="883"></A>and threw themselves heart and soul into the work of preparation. Guards 
<A NAME="884"></A>or envoys, as the case might be, were sent round to the Sicels, garrisons 
<A NAME="885"></A>put into the posts of the Peripoli in the country, horses and arms reviewed 
<A NAME="886"></A>in the city to see that nothing was wanting, and all other steps taken 
<A NAME="887"></A>to prepare for a war which might be upon them at any 
<A NAME="888"></A>moment.
<A NAME="889"></A><BR><BR>Meanwhile the three ships that had been sent on came from Egesta 
<A NAME="890"></A>to the Athenians at Rhegium, with the news that so far from there being 
<A NAME="891"></A>the sums promised, all that could be produced was thirty talents. The generals 
<A NAME="892"></A>were not a little disheartened at being thus disappointed at the outset, 
<A NAME="893"></A>and by the refusal to join in the expedition of the Rhegians, the people 
<A NAME="894"></A>they had first tried to gain and had had had most reason to count upon, 
<A NAME="895"></A>from their relationship to the Leontines and constant friendship for Athens. 
<A NAME="896"></A>If Nicias was prepared for the news from Egesta, his two colleagues were 
<A NAME="897"></A>taken completely by surprise. The Egestaeans had had recourse to the following 
<A NAME="898"></A>stratagem, when the first envoys from Athens came to inspect their resources. 
<A NAME="899"></A>They took the envoys in question to the temple of Aphrodite at Eryx and 
<A NAME="900"></A>showed them the treasures deposited there: bowls, wine-ladles, censers, 
<A NAME="901"></A>and a large number of other pieces of plate, which from being in silver 
<A NAME="902"></A>gave an impression of wealth quite out of proportion to their really small 
<A NAME="903"></A>value. They also privately entertained the ships' crews, and collected 
<A NAME="904"></A>all the cups of gold and silver that they could find in Egesta itself or 
<A NAME="905"></A>could borrow in the neighbouring Phoenician and Hellenic towns, and each 
<A NAME="906"></A>brought them to the banquets as their own; and as all used pretty nearly 
<A NAME="907"></A>the same, and everywhere a great quantity of plate was shown, the effect 
<A NAME="908"></A>was most dazzling upon the Athenian sailors, and made them talk loudly 
<A NAME="909"></A>of the riches they had seen when they got back to Athens. The dupes in 
<A NAME="910"></A>question- who had in their turn persuaded the rest- when the news got abroad 
<A NAME="911"></A>that there was not the money supposed at Egesta, were much blamed by the 
<A NAME="912"></A>soldiers.
<A NAME="913"></A><BR><BR>Meanwhile the generals consulted upon what was to be done. The 
<A NAME="914"></A>opinion of Nicias was to sail with all the armament to Selinus, the main 
<A NAME="915"></A>object of the expedition, and if the Egestaeans could provide money for 
<A NAME="916"></A>the whole force, to advise accordingly; but if they could not, to require 
<A NAME="917"></A>them to supply provisions for the sixty ships that they had asked for, 
<A NAME="918"></A>to stay and settle matters between them and the Selinuntines either by 
<A NAME="919"></A>force or by agreement, and then to coast past the other cities, and after 
<A NAME="920"></A>displaying the power of Athens and proving their zeal for their friends 
<A NAME="921"></A>and allies, to sail home again (unless they should have some sudden and 
<A NAME="922"></A>unexpected opportunity of serving the Leontines, or of bringing over some 
<A NAME="923"></A>of the other cities), and not to endanger the state by wasting its home 
<A NAME="924"></A>resources.
<A NAME="925"></A><BR><BR>Alcibiades said that a great expedition like the present must not 
<A NAME="926"></A>disgrace itself by going away without having done anything; heralds must 
<A NAME="927"></A>be sent to all the cities except Selinus and Syracuse, and efforts be made 
<A NAME="928"></A>to make some of the Sicels revolt from the Syracusans, and to obtain the 
<A NAME="929"></A>friendship of others, in order to have corn and troops; and first of all 
<A NAME="930"></A>to gain the Messinese, who lay right in the passage and entrance to Sicily, 
<A NAME="931"></A>and would afford an excellent harbour and base for the army. Thus, after 
<A NAME="932"></A>bringing over the towns and knowing who would be their allies in the war, 
<A NAME="933"></A>they might at length attack Syracuse and Selinus; unless the latter came 
<A NAME="934"></A>to terms with Egesta and the former ceased to oppose the restoration of 
<A NAME="935"></A>Leontini.
<A NAME="936"></A><BR><BR>Lamachus, on the other hand, said that they ought to sail straight 
<A NAME="937"></A>to Syracuse, and fight their battle at once under the walls of the town 
<A NAME="938"></A>while the people were still unprepared, and the panic at its height. Every 
<A NAME="939"></A>armament was most terrible at first; if it allowed time to run on without 
<A NAME="940"></A>showing itself, men's courage revived, and they saw it appear at last almost 
<A NAME="941"></A>with indifference. By attacking suddenly, while Syracuse still trembled 
<A NAME="942"></A>at their coming, they would have the best chance of gaining a victory for 
<A NAME="943"></A>themselves and of striking a complete panic into the enemy by the aspect 
<A NAME="944"></A>of their numbers- which would never appear so considerable as at present- 
<A NAME="945"></A>by the anticipation of coming disaster, and above all by the immediate 
<A NAME="946"></A>danger of the engagement. They might also count upon surprising many in 
<A NAME="947"></A>the fields outside, incredulous of their coming; and at the moment that 
<A NAME="948"></A>the enemy was carrying in his property the army would not want for booty 
<A NAME="949"></A>if it sat down in force before the city. The rest of the Siceliots would 
<A NAME="950"></A>thus be immediately less disposed to enter into alliance with the Syracusans, 
<A NAME="951"></A>and would join the Athenians, without waiting to see which were the strongest. 
<A NAME="952"></A>They must make Megara their naval station as a place to retreat to and 
<A NAME="953"></A>a base from which to attack: it was an uninhabited place at no great distance 
<A NAME="954"></A>from Syracuse either by land or by sea.
<A NAME="955"></A><BR><BR>After speaking to this effect, Lamachus nevertheless gave his support 
<A NAME="956"></A>to the opinion of Alcibiades. After this Alcibiades sailed in his own vessel 
<A NAME="957"></A>across to Messina with proposals of alliance, but met with no success, 
<A NAME="958"></A>the inhabitants answering that they could not receive him within their 
<A NAME="959"></A>walls, though they would provide him with a market outside. Upon this he 
<A NAME="960"></A>sailed back to Rhegium. Immediately upon his return the generals manned 
<A NAME="961"></A>and victualled sixty ships out of the whole fleet and coasted along to 
<A NAME="962"></A>Naxos, leaving the rest of the armament behind them at Rhegium with one 
<A NAME="963"></A>of their number. Received by the Naxians, they then coasted on to Catana, 
<A NAME="964"></A>and being refused admittance by the inhabitants, there being a Syracusan 
<A NAME="965"></A>party in the town, went on to the river Terias. Here they bivouacked, and 
<A NAME="966"></A>the next day sailed in single file to Syracuse with all their ships except 
<A NAME="967"></A>ten which they sent on in front to sail into the great harbour and see 
<A NAME="968"></A>if there was any fleet launched, and to proclaim by herald from shipboard 
<A NAME="969"></A>that the Athenians were come to restore the Leontines to their country, 
<A NAME="970"></A>as being their allies and kinsmen, and that such of them, therefore, as 
<A NAME="971"></A>were in Syracuse should leave it without fear and join their friends and 
<A NAME="972"></A>benefactors the Athenians. After making this proclamation and reconnoitring 
<A NAME="973"></A>the city and the harbours, and the features of the country which they would 
<A NAME="974"></A>have to make their base of operations in the war, they sailed back to 
<A NAME="975"></A>Catana.
<A NAME="976"></A><BR><BR>An assembly being held here, the inhabitants refused to receive 
<A NAME="977"></A>the armament, but invited the generals to come in and say what they desired; 
<A NAME="978"></A>and while Alcibiades was speaking and the citizens were intent on the assembly, 
<A NAME="979"></A>the soldiers broke down an ill-walled-up postern gate without being observed, 
<A NAME="980"></A>and getting inside the town, flocked into the marketplace. The Syracusan 
<A NAME="981"></A>party in the town no sooner saw the army inside than they became frightened 
<A NAME="982"></A>and withdrew, not being at all numerous; while the rest voted for an alliance 
<A NAME="983"></A>with the Athenians and invited them to fetch the rest of their forces from 
<A NAME="984"></A>Rhegium. After this the Athenians sailed to Rhegium, and put off, this 
<A NAME="985"></A>time with all the armament, for Catana, and fell to work at their camp 
<A NAME="986"></A>immediately upon their arrival.
<A NAME="987"></A><BR><BR>Meanwhile word was brought them from Camarina that if they went 
<A NAME="988"></A>there the town would go over to them, and also that the Syracusans were 
<A NAME="989"></A>manning a fleet. The Athenians accordingly sailed alongshore with all their 
<A NAME="990"></A>armament, first to Syracuse, where they found no fleet manning, and so 
<A NAME="991"></A>always along the coast to Camarina, where they brought to at the beach, 
<A NAME="992"></A>and sent a herald to the people, who, however, refused to receive them, 
<A NAME="993"></A>saying that their oaths bound them to receive the Athenians only with a 
<A NAME="994"></A>single vessel, unless they themselves sent for more. Disappointed here, 
<A NAME="995"></A>the Athenians now sailed back again, and after landing and plundering on 
<A NAME="996"></A>Syracusan territory and losing some stragglers from their light infantry 
<A NAME="997"></A>through the coming up of the Syracusan horse, so got back to 
<A NAME="998"></A>Catana.
<A NAME="999"></A><BR><BR>There they found the Salaminia come from Athens for Alcibiades, 
<A NAME="1000"></A>with orders for him to sail home to answer the charges which the state 
<A NAME="1001"></A>brought against him, and for certain others of the soldiers who with him 
<A NAME="1002"></A>were accused of sacrilege in the matter of the mysteries and of the Hermae. 
<A NAME="1003"></A>For the Athenians, after the departure of the expedition, had continued 
<A NAME="1004"></A>as active as ever in investigating the facts of the mysteries and of the 
<A NAME="1005"></A>Hermae, and, instead of testing the informers, in their suspicious temper 
<A NAME="1006"></A>welcomed all indifferently, arresting and imprisoning the best citizens 
<A NAME="1007"></A>upon the evidence of rascals, and preferring to sift the matter to the 
<A NAME="1008"></A>bottom sooner than to let an accused person of good character pass unquestioned, 
<A NAME="1009"></A>owing to the rascality of the informer. The commons had heard how oppressive 
<A NAME="1010"></A>the tyranny of Pisistratus and his sons had become before it ended, and 
<A NAME="1011"></A>further that that had been put down at last, not by themselves and Harmodius, 
<A NAME="1012"></A>but by the Lacedaemonians, and so were always in fear and took everything 
<A NAME="1013"></A>suspiciously.
<A NAME="1014"></A><BR><BR>Indeed, the daring action of Aristogiton and Harmodius was undertaken 
<A NAME="1015"></A>in consequence of a love affair, which I shall relate at some length, to 
<A NAME="1016"></A>show that the Athenians are not more accurate than the rest of the world 
<A NAME="1017"></A>in their accounts of their own tyrants and of the facts of their own history. 
<A NAME="1018"></A>Pisistratus dying at an advanced age in possession of the tyranny, was 
<A NAME="1019"></A>succeeded by his eldest son, Hippias, and not Hipparchus, as is vulgarly 
<A NAME="1020"></A>believed. Harmodius was then in the flower of youthful beauty, and Aristogiton, 
<A NAME="1021"></A>a citizen in the middle rank of life, was his lover and possessed him. 
<A NAME="1022"></A>Solicited without success by Hipparchus, son of Pisistratus, Harmodius 
<A NAME="1023"></A>told Aristogiton, and the enraged lover, afraid that the powerful Hipparchus 
<A NAME="1024"></A>might take Harmodius by force, immediately formed a design, such as his 
<A NAME="1025"></A>condition in life permitted, for overthrowing the tyranny. In the meantime 
<A NAME="1026"></A>Hipparchus, after a second solicitation of Harmodius, attended with no 
<A NAME="1027"></A>better success, unwilling to use violence, arranged to insult him in some 
<A NAME="1028"></A>covert way. Indeed, generally their government was not grievous to the 
<A NAME="1029"></A>multitude, or in any way odious in practice; and these tyrants cultivated 
<A NAME="1030"></A>wisdom and virtue as much as any, and without exacting from the Athenians 
<A NAME="1031"></A>more than a twentieth of their income, splendidly adorned their city, and 
<A NAME="1032"></A>carried on their wars, and provided sacrifices for the temples. For the 
<A NAME="1033"></A>rest, the city was left in full enjoyment of its existing laws, except 
<A NAME="1034"></A>that care was always taken to have the offices in the hands of some one 
<A NAME="1035"></A>of the family. Among those of them that held the yearly archonship at Athens 
<A NAME="1036"></A>was Pisistratus, son of the tyrant Hippias, and named after his grandfather, 
<A NAME="1037"></A>who dedicated during his term of office the altar to the twelve gods in 
<A NAME="1038"></A>the market-place, and that of Apollo in the Pythian precinct. The Athenian 
<A NAME="1039"></A>people afterwards built on to and lengthened the altar in the market-place, 
<A NAME="1040"></A>and obliterated the inscription; but that in the Pythian precinct can still 
<A NAME="1041"></A>be seen, though in faded letters, and is to the following 
<A NAME="1042"></A>effect:
<A NAME="1043"></A><BR><BR>Pisistratus, the son of Hippias,
<A NAME="1044"></A><BR>Sent up this record of his archonship
<A NAME="1045"></A><BR>In precinct of Apollo Pythias.
<A NAME="1046"></A><BR><BR>That Hippias was the eldest son and succeeded to the government, 
<A NAME="1047"></A>is what I positively assert as a fact upon which I have had more exact 
<A NAME="1048"></A>accounts than others, and may be also ascertained by the following circumstance. 
<A NAME="1049"></A>He is the only one of the legitimate brothers that appears to have had 
<A NAME="1050"></A>children; as the altar shows, and the pillar placed in the Athenian Acropolis, 
<A NAME="1051"></A>commemorating the crime of the tyrants, which mentions no child of Thessalus 
<A NAME="1052"></A>or of Hipparchus, but five of Hippias, which he had by Myrrhine, daughter 
<A NAME="1053"></A>of Callias, son of Hyperechides; and naturally the eldest would have married 
<A NAME="1054"></A>first. Again, his name comes first on the pillar after that of his father; 
<A NAME="1055"></A>and this too is quite natural, as he was the eldest after him, and the 
<A NAME="1056"></A>reigning tyrant. Nor can I ever believe that Hippias would have obtained 
<A NAME="1057"></A>the tyranny so easily, if Hipparchus had been in power when he was killed, 
<A NAME="1058"></A>and he, Hippias, had had to establish himself upon the same day; but he 
<A NAME="1059"></A>had no doubt been long accustomed to overawe the citizens, and to be obeyed 
<A NAME="1060"></A>by his mercenaries, and thus not only conquered, but conquered with ease, 
<A NAME="1061"></A>without experiencing any of the embarrassment of a younger brother unused 
<A NAME="1062"></A>to the exercise of authority. It was the sad fate which made Hipparchus 
<A NAME="1063"></A>famous that got him also the credit with posterity of having been 
<A NAME="1064"></A>tyrant.
<A NAME="1065"></A><BR><BR>To return to Harmodius; Hipparchus having been repulsed in his 
<A NAME="1066"></A>solicitations insulted him as he had resolved, by first inviting a sister 
<A NAME="1067"></A>of his, a young girl, to come and bear a basket in a certain procession, 
<A NAME="1068"></A>and then rejecting her, on the plea that she had never been invited at 
<A NAME="1069"></A>all owing to her unworthiness. If Harmodius was indignant at this, Aristogiton 
<A NAME="1070"></A>for his sake now became more exasperated than ever; and having arranged 
<A NAME="1071"></A>everything with those who were to join them in the enterprise, they only 
<A NAME="1072"></A>waited for the great feast of the Panathenaea, the sole day upon which 
<A NAME="1073"></A>the citizens forming part of the procession could meet together in arms 
<A NAME="1074"></A>without suspicion. Aristogiton and Harmodius were to begin, but were to 
<A NAME="1075"></A>be supported immediately by their accomplices against the bodyguard. The 
<A NAME="1076"></A>conspirators were not many, for better security, besides which they hoped 
<A NAME="1077"></A>that those not in the plot would be car
