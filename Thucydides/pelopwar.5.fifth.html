<A NAME="10"></A><B>Chapter XV</B>
<A NAME="11"></A><BR><BR><B>Tenth Year of the War - Death of Cleon and</B> <B>Brasidas - 
<A NAME="12"></A>Peace of Nicias</B>
<A NAME="13"></A><BR><BR>The next summer the truce for a year ended, after lasting until 
<A NAME="14"></A>the Pythian games. During the armistice the Athenians expelled the Delians 
<A NAME="15"></A>from Delos, concluding that they must have been polluted by some old offence 
<A NAME="16"></A>at the time of their consecration, and that this had been the omission 
<A NAME="17"></A>in the previous purification of the island, which, as I have related, had 
<A NAME="18"></A>been thought to have been duly accomplished by the removal of the graves 
<A NAME="19"></A>of the dead. The Delians had Atramyttium in Asia given them by Pharnaces, 
<A NAME="20"></A>and settled there as they removed from Delos.
<A NAME="21"></A><BR><BR>Meanwhile Cleon prevailed on the Athenians to let him set sail 
<A NAME="22"></A>at the expiration of the armistice for the towns in the direction of Thrace 
<A NAME="23"></A>with twelve hundred heavy infantry and three hundred horse from Athens, 
<A NAME="24"></A>a large force of the allies, and thirty ships. First touching at the still 
<A NAME="25"></A>besieged Scione, and taking some heavy infantry from the army there, he 
<A NAME="26"></A>next sailed into Cophos, a harbour in the territory of Torone, which is 
<A NAME="27"></A>not far from the town. From thence, having learnt from deserters that Brasidas 
<A NAME="28"></A>was not in Torone, and that its garrison was not strong enough to give 
<A NAME="29"></A>him battle, he advanced with his army against the town, sending ten ships 
<A NAME="30"></A>to sail round into the harbour. He first came to the fortification lately 
<A NAME="31"></A>thrown up in front of the town by Brasidas in order to take in the suburb, 
<A NAME="32"></A>to do which he had pulled down part of the original wall and made it all 
<A NAME="33"></A>one city. To this point Pasitelidas, the Lacedaemonian commander, with 
<A NAME="34"></A>such garrison as there was in the place, hurried to repel the Athenian 
<A NAME="35"></A>assault; but finding himself hard pressed, and seeing the ships that had 
<A NAME="36"></A>been sent round sailing into the harbour, Pasitelidas began to be afraid 
<A NAME="37"></A>that they might get up to the city before its defenders were there and, 
<A NAME="38"></A>the fortification being also carried, he might be taken prisoner, and so 
<A NAME="39"></A>abandoned the outwork and ran into the town. But the Athenians from the 
<A NAME="40"></A>ships had already taken Torone, and their land forces following at his 
<A NAME="41"></A>heels burst in with him with a rush over the part of the old wall that 
<A NAME="42"></A>had been pulled down, killing some of the Peloponnesians and Toronaeans 
<A NAME="43"></A>in the melee, and making prisoners of the rest, and Pasitelidas their commander 
<A NAME="44"></A>amongst them. Brasidas meanwhile had advanced to relieve Torone, and had 
<A NAME="45"></A>only about four miles more to go when he heard of its fall on the road, 
<A NAME="46"></A>and turned back again. Cleon and the Athenians set up two trophies, one 
<A NAME="47"></A>by the harbour, the other by the fortification and, making slaves of the 
<A NAME="48"></A>wives and children of the Toronaeans, sent the men with the Peloponnesians 
<A NAME="49"></A>and any Chalcidians that were there, to the number of seven hundred, to 
<A NAME="50"></A>Athens; whence, however, they all came home afterwards, the Peloponnesians 
<A NAME="51"></A>on the conclusion of peace, and the rest by being exchanged against other 
<A NAME="52"></A>prisoners with the Olynthians. About the same time Panactum, a fortress 
<A NAME="53"></A>on the Athenian border, was taken by treachery by the Boeotians. Meanwhile 
<A NAME="54"></A>Cleon, after placing a garrison in Torone, weighed anchor and sailed around 
<A NAME="55"></A>Athos on his way to Amphipolis.
<A NAME="56"></A><BR><BR>About the same time Phaeax, son of Erasistratus, set sail with 
<A NAME="57"></A>two colleagues as ambassador from Athens to Italy and Sicily. The Leontines, 
<A NAME="58"></A>upon the departure of the Athenians from Sicily after the pacification, 
<A NAME="59"></A>had placed a number of new citizens upon the roll, and the commons had 
<A NAME="60"></A>a design for redividing the land; but the upper classes, aware of their 
<A NAME="61"></A>intention, called in the Syracusans and expelled the commons. These last 
<A NAME="62"></A>were scattered in various directions; but the upper classes came to an 
<A NAME="63"></A>agreement with the Syracusans, abandoned and laid waste their city, and 
<A NAME="64"></A>went and lived at Syracuse, where they were made citizens. Afterwards some 
<A NAME="65"></A>of them were dissatisfied, and leaving Syracuse occupied Phocaeae, a quarter 
<A NAME="66"></A>of the town of Leontini, and Bricinniae, a strong place in the Leontine 
<A NAME="67"></A>country, and being there joined by most of the exiled commons carried on 
<A NAME="68"></A>war from the fortifications. The Athenians hearing this, sent Phaeax to 
<A NAME="69"></A>see if they could not by some means so convince their allies there and 
<A NAME="70"></A>the rest of the Sicilians of the ambitious designs of Syracuse as to induce 
<A NAME="71"></A>them to form a general coalition against her, and thus save the commons 
<A NAME="72"></A>of Leontini. Arrived in Sicily, Phaeax succeeded at Camarina and Agrigentum, 
<A NAME="73"></A>but meeting with a repulse at Gela did not go on to the rest, as he saw 
<A NAME="74"></A>that he should not succeed with them, but returned through the country 
<A NAME="75"></A>of the Sicels to Catana, and after visiting Bricinniae as he passed, and 
<A NAME="76"></A>encouraging its inhabitants, sailed back to Athens.
<A NAME="77"></A><BR><BR>During his voyage along the coast to and from Sicily, he treated 
<A NAME="78"></A>with some cities in Italy on the subject of friendship with Athens, and 
<A NAME="79"></A>also fell in with some Locrian settlers exiled from Messina, who had been 
<A NAME="80"></A>sent thither when the Locrians were called in by one of the factions that 
<A NAME="81"></A>divided Messina after the pacification of Sicily, and Messina came for 
<A NAME="82"></A>a time into the hands of the Locrians. These being met by Phaeax on their 
<A NAME="83"></A>return home received no injury at his hands, as the Locrians had agreed 
<A NAME="84"></A>with him for a treaty with Athens. They were the only people of the allies 
<A NAME="85"></A>who, when the reconciliation between the Sicilians took place, had not 
<A NAME="86"></A>made peace with her; nor indeed would they have done so now, if they had 
<A NAME="87"></A>not been pressed by a war with the Hipponians and Medmaeans who lived on 
<A NAME="88"></A>their border, and were colonists of theirs. Phaeax meanwhile proceeded 
<A NAME="89"></A>on his voyage, and at length arrived at Athens.
<A NAME="90"></A><BR><BR>Cleon, whom we left on his voyage from Torone to Amphipolis, made 
<A NAME="91"></A>Eion his base, and after an unsuccessful assault upon the Andrian colony 
<A NAME="92"></A>of Stagirus, took Galepsus, a colony of Thasos, by storm. He now sent envoys 
<A NAME="93"></A>to Perdiccas to command his attendance with an army, as provided by the 
<A NAME="94"></A>alliance; and others to Thrace, to Polles, king of the Odomantians, who 
<A NAME="95"></A>was to bring as many Thracian mercenaries as possible; and himself remained 
<A NAME="96"></A>inactive in Eion, awaiting their arrival. Informed of this, Brasidas on 
<A NAME="97"></A>his part took up a position of observation upon Cerdylium, a place situated 
<A NAME="98"></A>in the Argilian country on high ground across the river, not far from Amphipolis, 
<A NAME="99"></A>and commanding a view on all sides, and thus made it impossible for Cleon's 
<A NAME="100"></A>army to move without his seeing it; for he fully expected that Cleon, despising 
<A NAME="101"></A>the scanty numbers of his opponent, would march against Amphipolis with 
<A NAME="102"></A>the force that he had got with him. At the same time Brasidas made his 
<A NAME="103"></A>preparations, calling to his standard fifteen hundred Thracian mercenaries 
<A NAME="104"></A>and all the Edonians, horse and targeteers; he also had a thousand Myrcinian 
<A NAME="105"></A>and Chalcidian targeteers, besides those in Amphipolis, and a force of 
<A NAME="106"></A>heavy infantry numbering altogether about two thousand, and three hundred 
<A NAME="107"></A>Hellenic horse. Fifteen hundred of these he had with him upon Cerdylium; 
<A NAME="108"></A>the rest were stationed with Clearidas in Amphipolis.
<A NAME="109"></A><BR><BR>After remaining quiet for some time, Cleon was at length obliged 
<A NAME="110"></A>to do as Brasidas expected. His soldiers, tired of their inactivity, began 
<A NAME="111"></A>also seriously to reflect on the weakness and incompetence of their commander, 
<A NAME="112"></A>and the skill and valour that would be opposed to him, and on their own 
<A NAME="113"></A>original unwillingness to accompany him. These murmurs coming to the ears 
<A NAME="114"></A>of Cleon, he resolved not to disgust the army by keeping it in the same 
<A NAME="115"></A>place, and broke up his camp and advanced. The temper of the general was 
<A NAME="116"></A>what it had been at Pylos, his success on that occasion having given him 
<A NAME="117"></A>confidence in his capacity. He never dreamed of any one coming out to fight 
<A NAME="118"></A>him, but said that he was rather going up to view the place; and if he 
<A NAME="119"></A>waited for his reinforcements, it was not in order to make victory secure 
<A NAME="120"></A>in case he should be compelled to engage, but to be enabled to surround 
<A NAME="121"></A>and storm the city. He accordingly came and posted his army upon a strong 
<A NAME="122"></A>hill in front of Amphipolis, and proceeded to examine the lake formed by 
<A NAME="123"></A>the Strymon, and how the town lay on the side of Thrace. He thought to 
<A NAME="124"></A>retire at pleasure without fighting, as there was no one to be seen upon 
<A NAME="125"></A>the wall or coming out of the gates, all of which were shut. Indeed, it 
<A NAME="126"></A>seemed a mistake not to have brought down engines with him; he could then 
<A NAME="127"></A>have taken the town, there being no one to defend it.
<A NAME="128"></A><BR><BR>As soon as Brasidas saw the Athenians in motion he descended himself 
<A NAME="129"></A>from Cerdylium and entered Amphipolis. He did not venture to go out in 
<A NAME="130"></A>regular order against the Athenians: he mistrusted his strength, and thought 
<A NAME="131"></A>it inadequate to the attempt; not in numbers- these were not so unequal- 
<A NAME="132"></A>but in quality, the flower of the Athenian army being in the field, with 
<A NAME="133"></A>the best of the Lemnians and Imbrians. He therefore prepared to assail 
<A NAME="134"></A>them by stratagem. By showing the enemy the number of his troops, and the 
<A NAME="135"></A>shifts which he had been put to to to arm them, he thought that he should 
<A NAME="136"></A>have less chance of beating him than by not letting him have a sight of 
<A NAME="137"></A>them, and thus learn how good a right he had to despise them. He accordingly 
<A NAME="138"></A>picked out a hundred and fifty heavy infantry and, putting the rest under 
<A NAME="139"></A>Clearidas, determined to attack suddenly before the Athenians retired; 
<A NAME="140"></A>thinking that he should not have again such a chance of catching them alone, 
<A NAME="141"></A>if their reinforcements were once allowed to come up; and so calling all 
<A NAME="142"></A>his soldiers together in order to encourage them and explain his intention, 
<A NAME="143"></A>spoke as follows:
<A NAME="144"></A><BR><BR>"Peloponnesians, the character of the country from which we have 
<A NAME="145"></A>come, one which has always owed its freedom to valour, and the fact that 
<A NAME="146"></A>you are Dorians and the enemy you are about to fight Ionians, whom you 
<A NAME="147"></A>are accustomed to beat, are things that do not need further comment. But 
<A NAME="148"></A>the plan of attack that I propose to pursue, this it is as well to explain, 
<A NAME="149"></A>in order that the fact of our adventuring with a part instead of with the 
<A NAME="150"></A>whole of our forces may not damp your courage by the apparent disadvantage 
<A NAME="151"></A>at which it places you. I imagine it is the poor opinion that he has of 
<A NAME="152"></A>us, and the fact that he has no idea of any one coming out to engage him, 
<A NAME="153"></A>that has made the enemy march up to the place and carelessly look about 
<A NAME="154"></A>him as he is doing, without noticing us. But the most successful soldier 
<A NAME="155"></A>will always be the man who most happily detects a blunder like this, and 
<A NAME="156"></A>who carefully consulting his own means makes his attack not so much by 
<A NAME="157"></A>open and regular approaches, as by seizing the opportunity of the moment; 
<A NAME="158"></A>and these stratagems, which do the greatest service to our friends by most 
<A NAME="159"></A>completely deceiving our enemies, have the most brilliant name in war. 
<A NAME="160"></A>Therefore, while their careless confidence continues, and they are still 
<A NAME="161"></A>thinking, as in my judgment they are now doing, more of retreat than of 
<A NAME="162"></A>maintaining their position, while their spirit is slack and not high-strung 
<A NAME="163"></A>with expectation, I with the men under my command will, if possible, take 
<A NAME="164"></A>them by surprise and fall with a run upon their centre; and do you, Clearidas, 
<A NAME="165"></A>afterwards, when you see me already upon them, and, as is likely, dealing 
<A NAME="166"></A>terror among them, take with you the Amphipolitans, and the rest of the 
<A NAME="167"></A>allies, and suddenly open the gates and dash at them, and hasten to engage 
<A NAME="168"></A>as quickly as you can. That is our best chance of establishing a panic 
<A NAME="169"></A>among them, as a fresh assailant has always more terrors for an enemy than 
<A NAME="170"></A>the one he is immediately engaged with. Show yourself a brave man, as a 
<A NAME="171"></A>Spartan should; and do you, allies, follow him like men, and remember that 
<A NAME="172"></A>zeal, honour, and obedience mark the good soldier, and that this day will 
<A NAME="173"></A>make you either free men and allies of Lacedaemon, or slaves of Athens; 
<A NAME="174"></A>even if you escape without personal loss of liberty or life, your bondage 
<A NAME="175"></A>will be on harsher terms than before, and you will also hinder the liberation 
<A NAME="176"></A>of the rest of the Hellenes. No cowardice then on your part, seeing the 
<A NAME="177"></A>greatness of the issues at stake, and I will show that what I preach to 
<A NAME="178"></A>others I can practise myself."
<A NAME="179"></A><BR><BR>After this brief speech Brasidas himself prepared for the sally, 
<A NAME="180"></A>and placed the rest with Clearidas at the Thracian gates to support him 
<A NAME="181"></A>as had been agreed. Meanwhile he had been seen coming down from Cerdylium 
<A NAME="182"></A>and then in the city, which is overlooked from the outside, sacrificing 
<A NAME="183"></A>near the temple of Athene; in short, all his movements had been observed, 
<A NAME="184"></A>and word was brought to Cleon, who had at the moment gone on to look about 
<A NAME="185"></A>him, that the whole of the enemy's force could be seen in the town, and 
<A NAME="186"></A>that the feet of horses and men in great numbers were visible under the 
<A NAME="187"></A>gates, as if a sally were intended. Upon hearing this he went up to look, 
<A NAME="188"></A>and having done so, being unwilling to venture upon the decisive step of 
<A NAME="189"></A>a battle before his reinforcements came up, and fancying that he would 
<A NAME="190"></A>have time to retire, bid the retreat be sounded and sent orders to the 
<A NAME="191"></A>men to effect it by moving on the left wing in the direction of Eion, which 
<A NAME="192"></A>was indeed the only way practicable. This however not being quick enough 
<A NAME="193"></A>for him, he joined the retreat in person and made the right wing wheel 
<A NAME="194"></A>round, thus turning its unarmed side to the enemy. It was then that Brasidas, 
<A NAME="195"></A>seeing the Athenian force in motion and his opportunity come, said to the 
<A NAME="196"></A>men with him and the rest: "Those fellows will never stand before us, one 
<A NAME="197"></A>can see that by the way their spears and heads are going. Troops which 
<A NAME="198"></A>do as they do seldom stand a charge. Quick, someone, and open the gates 
<A NAME="199"></A>I spoke of, and let us be out and at them with no fears for the result." 
<A NAME="200"></A>Accordingly issuing out by the palisade gate and by the first in the long 
<A NAME="201"></A>wall then existing, he ran at the top of his speed along the straight road, 
<A NAME="202"></A>where the trophy now stands as you go by the steepest part of the hill, 
<A NAME="203"></A>and fell upon and routed the centre of the Athenians, panic-stricken by 
<A NAME="204"></A>their own disorder and astounded at his audacity. At the same moment Clearidas 
<A NAME="205"></A>in execution of his orders issued out from the Thracian gates to support 
<A NAME="206"></A>him, and also attacked the enemy. The result was that the Athenians, suddenly 
<A NAME="207"></A>and unexpectedly attacked on both sides, fell into confusion; and their 
<A NAME="208"></A>left towards Eion, which had already got on some distance, at once broke 
<A NAME="209"></A>and fled. Just as it was in full retreat and Brasidas was passing on to 
<A NAME="210"></A>attack the right, he received a wound; but his fall was not perceived by 
<A NAME="211"></A>the Athenians, as he was taken up by those near him and carried off the 
<A NAME="212"></A>field. The Athenian right made a better stand, and though Cleon, who from 
<A NAME="213"></A>the first had no thought of fighting, at once fled and was overtaken and 
<A NAME="214"></A>slain by a Myrcinian targeteer, his infantry forming in close order upon 
<A NAME="215"></A>the hill twice or thrice repulsed the attacks of Clearidas, and did not 
<A NAME="216"></A>finally give way until they were surrounded and routed by the missiles 
<A NAME="217"></A>of the Myrcinian and Chalcidian horse and the targeteers. Thus the Athenian 
<A NAME="218"></A>army was all now in flight; and such as escaped being killed in the battle, 
<A NAME="219"></A>or by the Chalcidian horse and the targeteers, dispersed among the hills, 
<A NAME="220"></A>and with difficulty made their way to Eion. The men who had taken up and 
<A NAME="221"></A>rescued Brasidas, brought him into the town with the breath still in him: 
<A NAME="222"></A>he lived to hear of the victory of his troops, and not long after expired. 
<A NAME="223"></A>The rest of the army returning with Clearidas from the pursuit stripped 
<A NAME="224"></A>the dead and set up a trophy. After this all the allies attended in arms 
<A NAME="225"></A>and buried Brasidas at the public expense in the city, in front of what 
<A NAME="226"></A>is now the marketplace, and the Amphipolitans, having enclosed his tomb, 
<A NAME="227"></A>ever afterwards sacrifice to him as a hero and have given to him the honour 
<A NAME="228"></A>of games and annual offerings. They constituted him the founder of their 
<A NAME="229"></A>colony, and pulled down the Hagnonic erections, and obliterated everything 
<A NAME="230"></A>that could be interpreted as a memorial of his having founded the place; 
<A NAME="231"></A>for they considered that Brasidas had been their preserver, and courting 
<A NAME="232"></A>as they did the alliance of Lacedaemon for fear of Athens, in their present 
<A NAME="233"></A>hostile relations with the latter they could no longer with the same advantage 
<A NAME="234"></A>or satisfaction pay Hagnon his honours. They also gave the Athenians back 
<A NAME="235"></A>their dead. About six hundred of the latter had fallen and only seven of 
<A NAME="236"></A>the enemy, owing to there having been no regular engagement, but the affair 
<A NAME="237"></A>of accident and panic that I have described. After taking up their dead 
<A NAME="238"></A>the Athenians sailed off home, while Clearidas and his troops remained 
<A NAME="239"></A>to arrange matters at Amphipolis.
<A NAME="240"></A><BR><BR>About the same time three Lacedaemonians- Ramphias, Autocharidas, 
<A NAME="241"></A>and Epicydidas- led a reinforcement of nine hundred heavy infantry to the 
<A NAME="242"></A>towns in the direction of Thrace, and arriving at Heraclea in Trachis reformed 
<A NAME="243"></A>matters there as seemed good to them. While they delayed there, this battle 
<A NAME="244"></A>took place and so the summer ended.
<A NAME="245"></A><BR><BR>With the beginning of the winter following, Ramphias and his companions 
<A NAME="246"></A>penetrated as far as Pierium in Thessaly; but as the Thessalians opposed 
<A NAME="247"></A>their further advance, and Brasidas whom they came to reinforce was dead, 
<A NAME="248"></A>they turned back home, thinking that the moment had gone by, the Athenians 
<A NAME="249"></A>being defeated and gone, and themselves not equal to the execution of Brasidas's 
<A NAME="250"></A>designs. The main cause however of their return was because they knew that 
<A NAME="251"></A>when they set out Lacedaemonian opinion was really in favour of 
<A NAME="252"></A>peace.
<A NAME="253"></A><BR><BR>Indeed it so happened that directly after the battle of Amphipolis 
<A NAME="254"></A>and the retreat of Ramphias from Thessaly, both sides ceased to prosecute 
<A NAME="255"></A>the war and turned their attention to peace. Athens had suffered severely 
<A NAME="256"></A>at Delium, and again shortly afterwards at Amphipolis, and had no longer 
<A NAME="257"></A>that confidence in her strength which had made her before refuse to treat, 
<A NAME="258"></A>in the belief of ultimate victory which her success at the moment had inspired; 
<A NAME="259"></A>besides, she was afraid of her allies being tempted by her reverses to 
<A NAME="260"></A>rebel more generally, and repented having let go the splendid opportunity 
<A NAME="261"></A>for peace which the affair of Pylos had offered. Lacedaemon, on the other 
<A NAME="262"></A>hand, found the event of the war to falsify her notion that a few years 
<A NAME="263"></A>would suffice for the overthrow of the power of the Athenians by the devastation 
<A NAME="264"></A>of their land. She had suffered on the island a disaster hitherto unknown 
<A NAME="265"></A>at Sparta; she saw her country plundered from Pylos and Cythera; the Helots 
<A NAME="266"></A>were deserting, and she was in constant apprehension that those who remained 
<A NAME="267"></A>in Peloponnese would rely upon those outside and take advantage of the 
<A NAME="268"></A>situation to renew their old attempts at revolution. Besides this, as chance 
<A NAME="269"></A>would have it, her thirty years' truce with the Argives was upon the point 
<A NAME="270"></A>of expiring; and they refused to renew it unless Cynuria were restored 
<A NAME="271"></A>to them; so that it seemed impossible to fight Argos and Athens at once. 
<A NAME="272"></A>She also suspected some of the cities in Peloponnese of intending to go 
<A NAME="273"></A>over to the endeed was indeed the case.
<A NAME="274"></A><BR><BR>These considerations made both sides disposed for an accommodation; 
<A NAME="275"></A>the Lacedaemonians being probably the most eager, as they ardently desired 
<A NAME="276"></A>to recover the men taken upon the island, the Spartans among whom belonged 
<A NAME="277"></A>to the first families and were accordingly related to the governing body 
<A NAME="278"></A>in Lacedaemon. Negotiations had been begun directly after their capture, 
<A NAME="279"></A>but the Athenians in their hour of triumph would not consent to any reasonable 
<A NAME="280"></A>terms; though after their defeat at Delium, Lacedaemon, knowing that they 
<A NAME="281"></A>would be now more inclined to listen, at once concluded the armistice for 
<A NAME="282"></A>a year, during which they were to confer together and see if a longer period 
<A NAME="283"></A>could not be agreed upon.
<A NAME="284"></A><BR><BR>Now, however, after the Athenian defeat at Amphipolis, and the 
<A NAME="285"></A>death of Cleon and Brasidas, who had been the two principal opponents of 
<A NAME="286"></A>peace on either side- the latter from the success and honour which war 
<A NAME="287"></A>gave him, the former because he thought that, if tranquillity were restored, 
<A NAME="288"></A>his crimes would be more open to detection and his slanders less credited- 
<A NAME="289"></A>the foremost candidates for power in either city, Pleistoanax, son of Pausanias, 
<A NAME="290"></A>king of Lacedaemon, and Nicias, son of Niceratus, the most fortunate general 
<A NAME="291"></A>of his time, each desired peace more ardently than ever. Nicias, while 
<A NAME="292"></A>still happy and honoured, wished to secure his good fortune, to obtain 
<A NAME="293"></A>a present release from trouble for himself and his countrymen, and hand 
<A NAME="294"></A>down to posterity a name as an ever-successful statesman, and thought the 
<A NAME="295"></A>way to do this was to keep out of danger and commit himself as little as 
<A NAME="296"></A>possible to fortune, and that peace alone made this keeping out of danger 
<A NAME="297"></A>possible. Pleistoanax, again, was assailed by his enemies for his restoration, 
<A NAME="298"></A>and regularly held up by them to the prejudice of his countrymen, upon 
<A NAME="299"></A>every reverse that befell them, as though his unjust restoration were the 
<A NAME="300"></A>cause; the accusation being that he and his brother Aristocles had bribed 
<A NAME="301"></A>the prophetess of Delphi to tell the Lacedaemonian deputations which successively 
<A NAME="302"></A>arrived at the temple to bring home the seed of the demigod son of Zeus 
<A NAME="303"></A>from abroad, else they would have to plough with a silver share. In this 
<A NAME="304"></A>way, it was insisted, in time he had induced the Lacedaemonians in the 
<A NAME="305"></A>nineteenth year of his exile to Lycaeum (whither he had gone when banished 
<A NAME="306"></A>on suspicion of having been bribed to retreat from Attica, and had built 
<A NAME="307"></A>half his house within the consecrated precinct of Zeus for fear of the 
<A NAME="308"></A>Lacedaemonians), to restore him with the same dances and sacrifices with 
<A NAME="309"></A>which they had instituted their kings upon the first settlement of Lacedaemon. 
<A NAME="310"></A>The smart of this accusation, and the reflection that in peace no disaster 
<A NAME="311"></A>could occur, and that when Lacedaemon had recovered her men there would 
<A NAME="312"></A>be nothing for his enemies to take hold of (whereas, while war lasted, 
<A NAME="313"></A>the highest station must always bear the scandal of everything that went 
<A NAME="314"></A>wrong), made him ardently desire a settlement. Accordingly this winter 
<A NAME="315"></A>was employed in conferences; and as spring rapidly approached, the Lacedaemonians 
<A NAME="316"></A>sent round orders to the cities to prepare for a fortified occupation of 
<A NAME="317"></A>Attica, and held this as a sword over the heads of the Athenians to induce 
<A NAME="318"></A>them to listen to their overtures; and at last, after many claims had been 
<A NAME="319"></A>urged on either side at the conferences a peace was agreed on upon the 
<A NAME="320"></A>following basis. Each party was to restore its conquests, but Athens was 
<A NAME="321"></A>to keep Nisaea; her demand for Plataea being met by the Thebans asserting 
<A NAME="322"></A>that they had acquired the place not by force or treachery, but by the 
<A NAME="323"></A>voluntary adhesion upon agreement of its citizens; and the same, according 
<A NAME="324"></A>to the Athenian account, being the history of her acquisition of Nisaea. 
<A NAME="325"></A>This arranged, the Lacedaemonians summoned their allies, and all voting 
<A NAME="326"></A>for peace except the Boeotians, Corinthians, Eleans, and Megarians, who 
<A NAME="327"></A>did not approve of these proceedings, they concluded the treaty and made 
<A NAME="328"></A>peace, each of the contracting parties swearing to the following 
<A NAME="329"></A>articles:
<A NAME="330"></A><BR><BR>The Athenians and Lacedaemonians and their allies made a treaty, 
<A NAME="331"></A>and swore to it, city by city, as follows;
<A NAME="332"></A><BR><BR><B>1.</B> Touching the national temples, there shall be a free 
<A NAME="333"></A>passage by land and by sea to all who wish it, to sacrifice, travel, consult, 
<A NAME="334"></A>and attend the oracle or games, according to the customs of their 
<A NAME="335"></A>countries.
<A NAME="336"></A><BR><BR><B>2.</B> The temple and shrine of Apollo at Delphi and the Delphians 
<A NAME="337"></A>shall be governed by their own laws, taxed by their own state, and judged 
<A NAME="338"></A>by their own judges, the land and the people, according to the custom of 
<A NAME="339"></A>their country.
<A NAME="340"></A><BR><BR><B>3.</B> The treaty shall be binding for fifty years upon the 
<A NAME="341"></A>Athenians and the allies of the Athenians, and upon the Lacedaemonians 
<A NAME="342"></A>and the allies of the Lacedaemonians, without fraud or hurt by land or 
<A NAME="343"></A>by sea.
<A NAME="344"></A><BR><BR><B>4.</B> It shall not be lawful to take up arms, with intent to 
<A NAME="345"></A>do hurt, either for the Lacedaemonians and their allies against the Athenians 
<A NAME="346"></A>and their allies, or for the Athenians and their allies against the Lacedaemonians 
<A NAME="347"></A>and their allies, in any way or means whatsoever. But should any difference 
<A NAME="348"></A>arise between them they are to have recourse to law and oaths, according 
<A NAME="349"></A>as may be agreed between the parties.
<A NAME="350"></A><BR><BR><B>5.</B> The Lacedaemonians and their allies shall give back Amphipolis 
<A NAME="351"></A>to the Athenians. Nevertheless, in the case of cities given up by the Lacedaemonians 
<A NAME="352"></A>to the Athenians, the inhabitants shall be allowed to go where they please 
<A NAME="353"></A>and to take their property with them: and the cities shall be independent, 
<A NAME="354"></A>paying only the tribute of Aristides. And it shall not be lawful for the 
<A NAME="355"></A>Athenians or their allies to carry on war against them after the treaty 
<A NAME="356"></A>has been concluded, so long as the tribute is paid. The cities referred 
<A NAME="357"></A>to are Argilus, Stagirus, Acanthus, Scolus, Olynthus, and Spartolus. These 
<A NAME="358"></A>cities shall be neutral, allies neither of the Lacedaemonians nor of the 
<A NAME="359"></A>Athenians: but if the cities consent, it shall be lawful for the Athenians 
<A NAME="360"></A>to make them their allies, provided always that the cities wish it. The 
<A NAME="361"></A>Mecybernaeans, Sanaeans, and Singaeans shall inhabit their own cities, 
<A NAME="362"></A>as also the Olynthians and Acanthians: but the Lacedaemonians and their 
<A NAME="363"></A>allies shall give back Panactum to the Athenians.
<A NAME="364"></A><BR><BR><B>6.</B> The Athenians shall give back Coryphasium, Cythera, Methana, 
<A NAME="365"></A>Pteleum, and Atalanta to the Lacedaemonians, and also all Lacedaemonians 
<A NAME="366"></A>that are in the prison at Athens or elsewhere in the Athenian dominions, 
<A NAME="367"></A>and shall let go the Peloponnesians besieged in Scione, and all others 
<A NAME="368"></A>in Scione that are allies of the Lacedaemonians, and all whom Brasidas 
<A NAME="369"></A>sent in there, and any others of the allies of the Lacedaemonians that 
<A NAME="370"></A>may be in the prison at Athens or elsewhere in the Athenian 
<A NAME="371"></A>dominions.
<A NAME="372"></A><BR><BR><B>7.</B> The Lacedaemonians and their allies shall in like manner 
<A NAME="373"></A>give back any of the Athenians or their allies that they may have in their 
<A NAME="374"></A>hands.
<A NAME="375"></A><BR><BR><B>8.</B> In the case of Scione, Torone, and Sermylium, and any 
<A NAME="376"></A>other cities that the Athenians may have, the Athenians may adopt such 
<A NAME="377"></A>measures as they please.
<A NAME="378"></A><BR><BR><B>9.</B> The Athenians shall take an oath to the Lacedaemonians 
<A NAME="379"></A>and their allies, city by city. Every man shall swear by the most binding 
<A NAME="380"></A>oath of his country, seventeen from each city. The oath shall be as follows; 
<A NAME="381"></A>"I will abide by this agreement and treaty honestly and without deceit." 
<A NAME="382"></A>In the same way an oath shall be taken by the Lacedaemonians and their 
<A NAME="383"></A>allies to the Athenians: and the oath shall be renewed annually by both 
<A NAME="384"></A>parties. Pillars shall be erected at Olympia, Pythia, the Isthmus, at Athens 
<A NAME="385"></A>in the Acropolis, and at Lacedaemon in the temple at 
<A NAME="386"></A>Amyclae.
<A NAME="387"></A><BR><BR><B>10.</B> If anything be forgotten, whatever it be, and on whatever 
<A NAME="388"></A>point, it shall be consistent with their oath for both parties, the Athenians 
<A NAME="389"></A>and Lacedaemonians, to alter it, according to their 
<A NAME="390"></A>discretion.
<A NAME="391"></A><BR><BR>The treaty begins from the ephoralty of Pleistolas in Lacedaemon, 
<A NAME="392"></A>on the 27th day of the month of Artemisium, and from the archonship, of 
<A NAME="393"></A>Alcaeus at Athens, on the 25th day of the month of Elaphebolion. Those 
<A NAME="394"></A>who took the oath and poured the libations for the Lacedaemonians were 
<A NAME="395"></A>Pleistoanax, Agis, Pleistolas, Damagetis, Chionis, Metagenes, Acanthus, 
<A NAME="396"></A>Daithus, Ischagoras, Philocharidas, Zeuxidas, Antippus, Tellis, Alcinadas, 
<A NAME="397"></A>Empedias, Menas, and Laphilus: for the Athenians, Lampon, Isthmonicus, 
<A NAME="398"></A>Nicias, Laches, Euthydemus, Procles, Pythodorus, Hagnon, Myrtilus, Thrasycles, 
<A NAME="399"></A>Theagenes, Aristocrates, Iolcius, Timocrates, Leon, Lamachus, and 
<A NAME="400"></A>Demosthenes.
<A NAME="401"></A><BR><BR>This treaty was made in the spring, just at the end of winter, 
<A NAME="402"></A>directly after the city festival of Dionysus, just ten years, with the 
<A NAME="403"></A>difference of a few days, from the first invasion of Attica and the commencement 
<A NAME="404"></A>of this war. This must be calculated by the seasons rather than by trusting 
<A NAME="405"></A>to the enumeration of the names of the several magistrates or offices of 
<A NAME="406"></A>honour that are used to mark past events. Accuracy is impossible where 
<A NAME="407"></A>an event may have occurred in the beginning, or middle, or at any period 
<A NAME="408"></A>in their tenure of office. But by computing by summers and winters, the 
<A NAME="409"></A>method adopted in this history, it will be found that, each of these amounting 
<A NAME="410"></A>to half a year, there were ten summers and as many winters contained in 
<A NAME="411"></A>this first war.
<A NAME="412"></A><BR><BR>Meanwhile the Lacedaemonians, to whose lot it fell to begin the 
<A NAME="413"></A>work of restitution, immediately set free all the prisoners of war in their 
<A NAME="414"></A>possession, and sent Ischagoras, Menas, and Philocharidas as envoys to 
<A NAME="415"></A>the towns in the direction of Thrace, to order Clearidas to hand over Amphipolis 
<A NAME="416"></A>to the Athenians, and the rest of their allies each to accept the treaty 
<A NAME="417"></A>as it affected them. They, however, did not like its terms, and refused 
<A NAME="418"></A>to accept it; Clearidas also, willing to oblige the Chalcidians, would 
<A NAME="419"></A>not hand over the town, averring his inability to do so against their will. 
<A NAME="420"></A>Meanwhile he hastened in person to Lacedaemon with envoys from the place, 
<A NAME="421"></A>to defend his disobedience against the possible accusations of Ischagoras 
<A NAME="422"></A>and his companions, and also to see whether it was too late for the agreement 
<A NAME="423"></A>to be altered; and on finding the Lacedaemonians were bound, quickly set 
<A NAME="424"></A>out back again with instructions from them to hand over the place, if possible, 
<A NAME="425"></A>or at all events to bring out the Peloponnesians that were in 
<A NAME="426"></A>it.
<A NAME="427"></A><BR><BR>The allies happened to be present in person at Lacedaemon, and 
<A NAME="428"></A>those who had not accepted the treaty were now asked by the Lacedaemonians 
<A NAME="429"></A>to adopt it. This, however, they refused to do, for the same reasons as 
<A NAME="430"></A>before, unless a fairer one than the present were agreed upon; and remaining 
<A NAME="431"></A>firm in their determination were dismissed by the Lacedaemonians, who now 
<A NAME="432"></A>decided on forming an alliance with the Athenians, thinking that Argos, 
<A NAME="433"></A>who had refused the application of Ampelidas and Lichas for a renewal of 
<A NAME="434"></A>the treaty, would without Athens be no longer formidable, and that the 
<A NAME="435"></A>rest of the Peloponnese would be most likely to keep quiet, if the coveted 
<A NAME="436"></A>alliance of Athens were shut against them. Accordingly, after conference 
<A NAME="437"></A>with the Athenian ambassadors, an alliance was agreed upon and oaths were 
<A NAME="438"></A>exchanged, upon the terms following:
<A NAME="439"></A><BR><BR><B>1.</B> The Lacedaemonians shall be allies of the Athenians for 
<A NAME="440"></A>fifty years.
<A NAME="441"></A><BR><BR><B>2.</B> Should any enemy invade the territory of Lacedaemon and 
<A NAME="442"></A>injure the Lacedaemonians, the Athenians shall help in such way as they 
<A NAME="443"></A>most effectively can, according to their power. But if the invader be gone 
<A NAME="444"></A>after plundering the country, that city shall be the enemy of Lacedaemon 
<A NAME="445"></A>and Athens, and shall be chastised by both, and one shall not make peace 
<A NAME="446"></A>without the other. This to be honestly, loyally, and without 
<A NAME="447"></A>fraud.
<A NAME="448"></A><BR><BR><B>3.</B> Should any enemy invade the territory of Athens and injure 
<A NAME="449"></A>the Athenians, the Lacedaemonians shall help them in such way as they most 
<A NAME="450"></A>effectively can, according to their power. But if the invader be gone after 
<A NAME="451"></A>plundering the country, that city shall be the enemy of Lacedaemon and 
<A NAME="452"></A>Athens, and shall be chastised by both, and one shall not make peace without 
<A NAME="453"></A>the other. This to be honestly, loyally, and without 
<A NAME="454"></A>fraud.
<A NAME="455"></A><BR><BR><B>4.</B> Should the slave population rise, the Athenians shall 
<A NAME="456"></A>help the Lacedaemonians with all their might, according to their 
<A NAME="457"></A>power.
<A NAME="458"></A><BR><BR><B>5.</B> This treaty shall be sworn to by the same persons on 
<A NAME="459"></A>either side that swore to the other. It shall be renewed annually by the 
<A NAME="460"></A>Lacedaemonians going to Athens for the Dionysia, and the Athenians to Lacedaemon 
<A NAME="461"></A>for the Hyacinthia, and a pillar shall be set up by either party: at Lacedaemon 
<A NAME="462"></A>near the statue of Apollo at Amyclae, and at Athens on the Acropolis near 
<A NAME="463"></A>the statue of Athene. Should the Lacedaemonians and Athenians see to add 
<A NAME="464"></A>to or take away from the alliance in any particular, it shall be consistent 
<A NAME="465"></A>with their oaths for both parties to do so, according to their 
<A NAME="466"></A>discretion.
<A NAME="467"></A><BR><BR>Those who took the oath for the Lacedaemonians were Pleistoanax, 
<A NAME="468"></A>Agis, Pleistolas, Damagetus, Chionis, Metagenes, Acanthus, Daithus, Ischagoras, 
<A NAME="469"></A>Philocharidas, Zeuxidas, Antippus, Alcinadas, Tellis, Empedias, Menas, 
<A NAME="470"></A>and Laphilus; for the Athenians, Lampon, Isthmionicus, Laches, Nicias, 
<A NAME="471"></A>Euthydemus, Procles, Pythodorus, Hagnon, Myrtilus, Thrasycles, Theagenes, 
<A NAME="472"></A>Aristocrates, Iolcius, Timocrates, Leon, Lamachus, and 
<A NAME="473"></A>Demosthenes.
<A NAME="474"></A><BR><BR>This alliance was made not long after the treaty; and the Athenians 
<A NAME="475"></A>gave back the men from the island to the Lacedaemonians, and the summer 
<A NAME="476"></A>of the eleventh year began. This completes the history of the first war, 
<A NAME="477"></A>which occupied the whole of the ten years previously.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="478"></A><B>Chapter XVI</B>

<A NAME="479"></A><BR><BR>Feeling against Sparta in Peloponnese - League of the <B>Mantineans, 
<A NAME="480"></A>Eleans, Argives, and Athenians - Battle</B> <B>of Mantinea and breaking 
<A NAME="481"></A>up of the League</B>
<A NAME="482"></A><BR><BR>After the treaty and the alliance between the Lacedaemonians and 
<A NAME="483"></A>Athenians, concluded after the ten years' war, in the ephorate of Pleistolas 
<A NAME="484"></A>at Lacedaemon, and the archonship of Alcaeus at Athens, the states which 
<A NAME="485"></A>had accepted them were at peace; but the Corinthians and some of the cities 
<A NAME="486"></A>in Peloponnese trying to disturb the settlement, a fresh agitation was 
<A NAME="487"></A>instantly commenced by the allies against Lacedaemon. Further, the Lacedaemonians, 
<A NAME="488"></A>as time went on, became suspected by the Athenians through their not performing 
<A NAME="489"></A>some of the provisions in the treaty; and though for six years and ten 
<A NAME="490"></A>months they abstained from invasion of each other's territory, yet abroad 
<A NAME="491"></A>an unstable armistice did not prevent either party doing the other the 
<A NAME="492"></A>most effectual injury, until they were finally obliged to break the treaty 
<A NAME="493"></A>made after the ten years' war and to have recourse to open 
<A NAME="494"></A>hostilities.
<A NAME="495"></A><BR><BR>The history of this period has been also written by the same Thucydides, 
<A NAME="496"></A>an Athenian, in the chronological order of events by summers and winters, 
<A NAME="497"></A>to the time when the Lacedaemonians and their allies put an end to the 
<A NAME="498"></A>Athenian empire, and took the Long Walls and Piraeus. The war had then 
<A NAME="499"></A>lasted for twenty-seven years in all. Only a mistaken judgment can object 
<A NAME="500"></A>to including the interval of treaty in the war. Looked at by the light 
<A NAME="501"></A>of facts it cannot, it will be found, be rationally considered a state 
<A NAME="502"></A>of peace, where neither party either gave or got back all that they had 
<A NAME="503"></A>agreed, apart from the violations of it which occurred on both sides in 
<A NAME="504"></A>the Mantinean and Epidaurian wars and other instances, and the fact that 
<A NAME="505"></A>the allies in the direction of Thrace were in as open hostility as ever, 
<A NAME="506"></A>while the Boeotians had only a truce renewed every ten days. So that the 
<A NAME="507"></A>first ten years' war, the treacherous armistice that followed it, and the 
<A NAME="508"></A>subsequent war will, calculating by the seasons, be found to make up the 
<A NAME="509"></A>number of years which I have mentioned, with the difference of a few days, 
<A NAME="510"></A>and to afford an instance of faith in oracles being for once justified 
<A NAME="511"></A>by the event. I certainly all along remember from the beginning to the 
<A NAME="512"></A>end of the war its being commonly declared that it would last thrice nine 
<A NAME="513"></A>years. I lived through the whole of it, being of an age to comprehend events, 
<A NAME="514"></A>and giving my attention to them in order to know the exact truth about 
<A NAME="515"></A>them. It was also my fate to be an exile from my country for twenty years 
<A NAME="516"></A>after my command at Amphipolis; and being present with both parties, and 
<A NAME="517"></A>more especially with the Peloponnesians by reason of my exile, I had leisure 
<A NAME="518"></A>to observe affairs somewhat particularly. I will accordingly now relate 
<A NAME="519"></A>the differences that arose after the ten years' war, the breach of the 
<A NAME="520"></A>treaty, and the hostilities that followed.
<A NAME="521"></A><BR><BR>After the conclusion of the fifty years' truce and of the subsequent 
<A NAME="522"></A>alliance, the embassies from Peloponnese which had been summoned for this 
<A NAME="523"></A>business returned from Lacedaemon. The rest went straight home, but the 
<A NAME="524"></A>Corinthians first turned aside to Argos and opened negotiations with some 
<A NAME="525"></A>of the men in office there, pointing out that Lacedaemon could have no 
<A NAME="526"></A>good end in view, but only the subjugation of Peloponnese, or she would 
<A NAME="527"></A>never have entered into treaty and alliance with the once detested Athenians, 
<A NAME="528"></A>and that the duty of consulting for the safety of Peloponnese had now fallen 
<A NAME="529"></A>upon Argos, who should immediately pass a decree inviting any Hellenic 
<A NAME="530"></A>state that chose, such state being independent and accustomed to meet fellow 
<A NAME="531"></A>powers upon the fair and equal ground of law and justice, to make a defensive 
<A NAME="532"></A>alliance with the Argives; appointing a few individuals with plenipotentiary 
<A NAME="533"></A>powers, instead of making the people the medium of negotiation, in order 
<A NAME="534"></A>that, in the case of an applicant being rejected, the fact of his overtures 
<A NAME="535"></A>might not be made public. They said that many would come over from hatred 
<A NAME="536"></A>of the Lacedaemonians. After this explanation of their views, the Corinthians 
<A NAME="537"></A>returned home.
<A NAME="538"></A><BR><BR>The persons with whom they had communicated reported the proposal 
<A NAME="539"></A>to their government and people, and the Argives passed the decree and chose 
<A NAME="540"></A>twelve men to negotiate an alliance for any Hellenic state that wished 
<A NAME="541"></A>it, except Athens and Lacedaemon, neither of which should be able to join 
<A NAME="542"></A>without reference to the Argive people. Argos came into the plan the more 
<A NAME="543"></A>readily because she saw that war with Lacedaemon was inevitable, the truce 
<A NAME="544"></A>being on the point of expiring; and also because she hoped to gain the 
<A NAME="545"></A>supremacy of Peloponnese. For at this time Lacedaemon had sunk very low 
<A NAME="546"></A>in public estimation because of her disasters, while the Argives were in 
<A NAME="547"></A>a most flourishing condition, having taken no part in the Attic war, but 
<A NAME="548"></A>having on the contrary profited largely by their neutrality. The Argives 
<A NAME="549"></A>accordingly prepared to receive into alliance any of the Hellenes that 
<A NAME="550"></A>desired it.
<A NAME="551"></A><BR><BR>The Mantineans and their allies were the first to come over through 
<A NAME="552"></A>fear of the Lacedaemonians. Having taken advantage of the war against Athens 
<A NAME="553"></A>to reduce a large part of Arcadia into subjection, they thought that Lacedaemon 
<A NAME="554"></A>would not leave them undisturbed in their conquests, now that she had leisure 
<A NAME="555"></A>to interfere, and consequently gladly turned to a powerful city like Argos, 
<A NAME="556"></A>the historical enemy of the Lacedaemonians, and a sister democracy. Upon 
<A NAME="557"></A>the defection of Mantinea, the rest of Peloponnese at once began to agitate 
<A NAME="558"></A>the propriety of following her example, conceiving that the Mantineans 
<A NAME="559"></A>not have changed sides without good reason; besides which they were angry 
<A NAME="560"></A>with Lacedaemon among other reasons for having inserted in the treaty with 
<A NAME="561"></A>Athens that it should be consistent with their oaths for both parties, 
<A NAME="562"></A>Lacedaemonians and Athenians, to add to or take away from it according 
<A NAME="563"></A>to their discretion. It was this clause that was the real origin of the 
<A NAME="564"></A>panic in Peloponnese, by exciting suspicions of a Lacedaemonian and Athenian 
<A NAME="565"></A>combination against their liberties: any alteration should properly have 
<A NAME="566"></A>been made conditional upon the consent of the whole body of the allies. 
<A NAME="567"></A>With these apprehensions there was a very general desire in each state 
<A NAME="568"></A>to place itself in alliance with Argos.
<A NAME="569"></A><BR><BR>In the meantime the Lacedaemonians perceiving the agitation going 
<A NAME="570"></A>on in Peloponnese, and that Corinth was the author of it and was herself 
<A NAME="571"></A>about to enter into alliance with the Argives, sent ambassadors thither 
<A NAME="572"></A>in the hope of preventing what was in contemplation. They accused her of 
<A NAME="573"></A>having brought it all about, and told her that she could not desert Lacedaemon 
<A NAME="574"></A>and become the ally of Argos, without adding violation of her oaths to 
<A NAME="575"></A>the crime which she had already committed in not accepting the treaty with 
<A NAME="576"></A>Athens, when it had been expressly agreed that the decision of the majority 
<A NAME="577"></A>of the allies should be binding, unless the gods or heroes stood in the 
<A NAME="578"></A>way. Corinth in her answer, delivered before those of her allies who had 
<A NAME="579"></A>like her refused to accept the treaty, and whom she had previously invited 
<A NAME="580"></A>to attend, refrained from openly stating the injuries she complained of, 
<A NAME="581"></A>such as the non-recovery of Sollium or Anactorium from the Athenians, or 
<A NAME="582"></A>any other point in which she thought she had been prejudiced, but took 
<A NAME="583"></A>shelter under the pretext that she could not give up her Thracian allies, 
<A NAME="584"></A>to whom her separate individual security had been given, when they first 
<A NAME="585"></A>rebelled with Potidaea, as well as upon subsequent occasions. She denied, 
<A NAME="586"></A>therefore, that she committed any violation of her oaths to the allies 
<A NAME="587"></A>in not entering into the treaty with Athens; having sworn upon the faith 
<A NAME="588"></A>of the gods to her Thracian friends, she could not honestly give them up. 
<A NAME="589"></A>Besides, the expression was, "unless the gods or heroes stand in the way." 
<A NAME="590"></A>Now here, as it appeared to her, the gods stood in the way. This was what 
<A NAME="591"></A>she said on the subject of her former oaths. As to the Argive alliance, 
<A NAME="592"></A>she would confer with her friends and do whatever was right. The Lacedaemonian 
<A NAME="593"></A>envoys returning home, some Argive ambassadors who happened to be in Corinth 
<A NAME="594"></A>pressed her to conclude the alliance without further delay, but were told 
<A NAME="595"></A>to attend at the next congress to be held at Corinth.
<A NAME="596"></A><BR><BR>Immediately afterwards an Elean embassy arrived, and first making 
<A NAME="597"></A>an alliance with Corinth went on from thence to Argos, according to their 
<A NAME="598"></A>instructions, and became allies of the Argives, their country being just 
<A NAME="599"></A>then at enmity with Lacedaemon and Lepreum. Some time back there had been 
<A NAME="600"></A>a war between the Lepreans and some of the Arcadians; and the Eleans being 
<A NAME="601"></A>called in by the former with the offer of half their lands, had put an 
<A NAME="602"></A>end to the war, and leaving the land in the hands of its Leprean occupiers 
<A NAME="603"></A>had imposed upon them the tribute of a talent to the Olympian Zeus. Till 
<A NAME="604"></A>the Attic war this tribute was paid by the Lepreans, who then took the 
<A NAME="605"></A>war as an excuse for no longer doing so, and upon the Eleans using force 
<A NAME="606"></A>appealed to Lacedaemon. The case was thus submitted to her arbitrament; 
<A NAME="607"></A>but the Eleans, suspecting the fairness of the tribunal, renounced the 
<A NAME="608"></A>reference and laid waste the Leprean territory. The Lacedaemonians nevertheless 
<A NAME="609"></A>decided that the Lepreans were independent and the Eleans aggressors, and 
<A NAME="610"></A>as the latter did not abide by the arbitration, sent a garrison of heavy 
<A NAME="611"></A>infantry into Lepreum. Upon this the Eleans, holding that Lacedaemon had 
<A NAME="612"></A>received one of their rebel subjects, put forward the convention providing 
<A NAME="613"></A>that each confederate should come out of the Attic war in possession of 
<A NAME="614"></A>what he had when he went into it, and considering that justice had not 
<A NAME="615"></A>been done them went over to the Argives, and now made the alliance through 
<A NAME="616"></A>their ambassadors, who had been instructed for that purpose. Immediately 
<A NAME="617"></A>after them the Corinthians and the Thracian Chalcidians became allies of 
<A NAME="618"></A>Argos. Meanwhile the Boeotians and Megarians, who acted together, remained 
<A NAME="619"></A>quiet, being left to do as they pleased by Lacedaemon, and thinking that 
<A NAME="620"></A>the Argive democracy would not suit so well with their aristocratic government 
<A NAME="621"></A>as the Lacedaemonian constitution.
<A NAME="622"></A><BR><BR>About the same time in this summer Athens succeeded in reducing 
<A NAME="623"></A>Scione, put the adult males to death, and, making slaves of the women and 
<A NAME="624"></A>children, gave the land for the Plataeans to live in. She also brought 
<A NAME="625"></A>back the Delians to Delos, moved by her misfortunes in the field and by 
<A NAME="626"></A>the commands of the god at Delphi. Meanwhile the Phocians and Locrians 
<A NAME="627"></A>commenced hostilities. The Corinthians and Argives, being now in alliance, 
<A NAME="628"></A>went to Tegea to bring about its defection from Lacedaemon, seeing that, 
<A NAME="629"></A>if so considerable a state could be persuaded to join, all Peloponnese 
<A NAME="630"></A>would be with them. But when the Tegeans said that they would do nothing 
<A NAME="631"></A>against Lacedaemon, the hitherto zealous Corinthians relaxed their activity, 
<A NAME="632"></A>and began to fear that none of the rest would now come over. Still they 
<A NAME="633"></A>went to the Boeotians and tried to persuade them to alliance and a common 
<A NAME="634"></A>action generally with Argos and themselves, and also begged them to go 
<A NAME="635"></A>with them to Athens and obtain for them a ten days' truce similar to that 
<A NAME="636"></A>made between the Athenians and Boeotians not long after the fifty years' 
<A NAME="637"></A>treaty, and, in the event of the Athenians refusing, to throw up the armistice, 
<A NAME="638"></A>and not make any truce in future without Corinth. These were the requests 
<A NAME="639"></A>of the Corinthians. The Boeotians stopped them on the subject of the Argive 
<A NAME="640"></A>alliance, but went with them to Athens, where however they failed to obtain 
<A NAME="641"></A>the ten days' truce; the Athenian answer being that the Corinthians had 
<A NAME="642"></A>truce already, as being allies of Lacedaemon. Nevertheless the Boeotians 
<A NAME="643"></A>did not throw up their ten days' truce, in spite of the prayers and reproaches 
<A NAME="644"></A>of the Corinthians for their breach of faith; and these last had to content 
<A NAME="645"></A>themselves with a de facto armistice with Athens.
<A NAME="646"></A><BR><BR>The same summer the Lacedaemonians marched  into Arcadia with their 
<A NAME="647"></A>whole levy under Pleistoanax, son of Pausanias, king of Lacedaemon, against 
<A NAME="648"></A>the Parrhasians, who were subjects of Mantinea, and a faction of whom had 
<A NAME="649"></A>invited their aid. They also meant to demolish, if possible, the fort of 
<A NAME="650"></A>Cypsela which the Mantineans had built and garrisoned in the Parrhasian 
<A NAME="651"></A>territory, to annoy the district of Sciritis in Laconia. The Lacedaemonians 
<A NAME="652"></A>accordingly laid waste the Parrhasian country, and the Mantineans, placing 
<A NAME="653"></A>their town in the hands of an Argive garrison, addressed themselves to 
<A NAME="654"></A>the defence of their confederacy, but being unable to save Cypsela or the 
<A NAME="655"></A>Parrhasian towns went back to Mantinea. Meanwhile the Lacedaemonians made 
<A NAME="656"></A>the Parrhasians independent, razed the fortress, and returned 
<A NAME="657"></A>home.
<A NAME="658"></A><BR><BR>The same summer the soldiers from Thrace who had gone out with 
<A NAME="659"></A>Brasidas came back, having been brought from thence after the treaty by 
<A NAME="660"></A>Clearidas; and the Lacedaemonians decreed that the Helots who had fought 
<A NAME="661"></A>with Brasidas should be free and allowed to live where they liked, and 
<A NAME="662"></A>not long afterwards settled them with the Neodamodes at Lepreum, which 
<A NAME="663"></A>is situated on the Laconian and Elean border; Lacedaemon being at this 
<A NAME="664"></A>time at enmity with Elis. Those however of the Spartans who had been taken 
<A NAME="665"></A>prisoners on the island and had surrendered their arms might, it was feared, 
<A NAME="666"></A>suppose that they were to be subjected to some degradation in consequence 
<A NAME="667"></A>of their misfortune, and so make some attempt at revolution, if left in 
<A NAME="668"></A>possession of their franchise. These were therefore at once disfranchised, 
<A NAME="669"></A>although some of them were in office at the time, and thus placed under 
<A NAME="670"></A>a disability to take office, or buy and sell anything. After some time, 
<A NAME="671"></A>however, the franchise was restored to them.
<A NAME="672"></A><BR><BR>The same summer the Dians took Thyssus, a town on Acte by Athos 
<A NAME="673"></A>in alliance with Athens. During the whole of this summer intercourse between 
<A NAME="674"></A>the Athenians and Peloponnesians continued, although each party began to 
<A NAME="675"></A>suspect the other directly after the treaty, because of the places specified 
<A NAME="676"></A>in it not being restored. Lacedaemon, to whose lot it had fallen to begin 
<A NAME="677"></A>by restoring Amphipolis and the other towns, had not done so. She had equally 
<A NAME="678"></A>failed to get the treaty accepted by her Thracian allies, or by the Boeotians 
<A NAME="679"></A>or the Corinthians; although she was continually promising to unite with 
<A NAME="680"></A>Athens in compelling their compliance, if it were longer refused. She also 
<A NAME="681"></A>kept fixing a time at which those who still refused to come in were to 
<A NAME="682"></A>be declared enemies to both parties, but took care not to bind herself 
<A NAME="683"></A>by any written agreement. Meanwhile the Athenians, seeing none of these 
<A NAME="684"></A>professions performed in fact, began to suspect the honesty of her intentions, 
<A NAME="685"></A>and consequently not only refused to comply with her demands for Pylos, 
<A NAME="686"></A>but also repented having given up the prisoners from the island, and kept 
<A NAME="687"></A>tight hold of the other places, until Lacedaemon's part of the treaty should 
<A NAME="688"></A>be fulfilled. Lacedaemon, on the other hand, said she had done what she 
<A NAME="689"></A>could, having given up the Athenian prisoners of war in her possession, 
<A NAME="690"></A>evacuated Thrace, and performed everything else in her power. Amphipolis 
<A NAME="691"></A>it was out of her ability to restore; but she would endeavour to bring 
<A NAME="692"></A>the Boeotians and Corinthians into the treaty, to recover Panactum, and 
<A NAME="693"></A>send home all the Athenian prisoners of war in Boeotia. Meanwhile she required 
<A NAME="694"></A>that Pylos should be restored, or at all events that the Messenians and 
<A NAME="695"></A>Helots should be withdrawn, as her troops had been from Thrace, and the 
<A NAME="696"></A>place garrisoned, if necessary, by the Athenians themselves. After a number 
<A NAME="697"></A>of different conferences held during the summer, she succeeded in persuading 
<A NAME="698"></A>Athens to withdraw from Pylos the Messenians and the rest of the Helots 
<A NAME="699"></A>and deserters from Laconia, who were accordingly settled by her at Cranii 
<A NAME="700"></A>in Cephallenia. Thus during this summer there was peace and intercourse 
<A NAME="701"></A>between the two peoples.
<A NAME="702"></A><BR><BR>Next winter, however, the ephors under whom the treaty had been 
<A NAME="703"></A>made were no longer in office, and some of their successors were directly 
<A NAME="704"></A>opposed to it. Embassies now arrived from the Lacedaemonian confederacy, 
<A NAME="705"></A>and the Athenians, Boeotians, and Corinthians also presented themselves 
<A NAME="706"></A>at Lacedaemon, and after much discussion and no agreement between them, 
<A NAME="707"></A>separated for their several homes; when Cleobulus and Xenares, the two 
<A NAME="708"></A>ephors who were the most anxious to break off the treaty, took advantage 
<A NAME="709"></A>of this opportunity to communicate privately with the Boeotians and Corinthians, 
<A NAME="710"></A>and, advising them to act as much as possible together, instructed the 
<A NAME="711"></A>former first to enter into alliance with Argos, and then try and bring 
<A NAME="712"></A>themselves and the Argives into alliance with Lacedaemon. The Boeotians 
<A NAME="713"></A>would so be least likely to be compelled to come into the Attic treaty; 
<A NAME="714"></A>and the Lacedaemonians would prefer gaining the friendship and alliance 
<A NAME="715"></A>of Argos even at the price of the hostility of Athens and the rupture of 
<A NAME="716"></A>the treaty. The Boeotians knew that an honourable friendship with Argos 
<A NAME="717"></A>had been long the desire of Lacedaemon; for the Lacedaemonians believed 
<A NAME="718"></A>that this would considerably facilitate the conduct of the war outside 
<A NAME="719"></A>Peloponnese. Meanwhile they begged the Boeotians to place Panactum in her 
<A NAME="720"></A>hands in order that she might, if possible, obtain Pylos in exchange for 
<A NAME="721"></A>it, and so be more in a position to resume hostilities with 
<A NAME="722"></A>Athens.
<A NAME="723"></A><BR><BR>After receiving these instructions for their governments from Xenares 
<A NAME="724"></A>and Cleobulus and their friends at Lacedaemon, the Boeotians and Corinthians 
<A NAME="725"></A>departed. On their way home they were joined by two persons high in office 
<A NAME="726"></A>at Argos, who had waited for them on the road, and who now sounded them 
<A NAME="727"></A>upon the possibility of the Boeotians joining the Corinthians, Eleans, 
<A NAME="728"></A>and Mantineans in becoming the allies of Argos, in the idea that if this 
<A NAME="729"></A>could be effected they would be able, thus united, to make peace or war 
<A NAME="730"></A>as they pleased either against Lacedaemon or any other power. The Boeotian 
<A NAME="731"></A>envoys were were pleased at thus hearing themselves accidentally asked 
<A NAME="732"></A>to do what their friends at Lacedaemon had told them; and the two Argives 
<A NAME="733"></A>perceiving that their proposal was agreeable, departed with a promise to 
<A NAME="734"></A>send ambassadors to the Boeotians. On their arrival the Boeotians reported 
<A NAME="735"></A>to the Boeotarchs what had been said to them at Lacedaemon and also by 
<A NAME="736"></A>the Argives who had met them, and the Boeotarchs, pleased with the idea, 
<A NAME="737"></A>embraced it with the more eagerness from the lucky coincidence of Argos 
<A NAME="738"></A>soliciting the very thing wanted by their friends at Lacedaemon. Shortly 
<A NAME="739"></A>afterwards ambassadors appeared from Argos with the proposals indicated; 
<A NAME="740"></A>and the Boeotarchs approved of the terms and dismissed the ambassadors 
<A NAME="741"></A>with a promise to send envoys to Argos to negotiate the 
<A NAME="742"></A>alliance.
<A NAME="743"></A><BR><BR>In the meantime it was decided by the Boeotarchs, the Corinthians, 
<A NAME="744"></A>the Megarians, and the envoys from Thrace first to interchange oaths together 
<A NAME="745"></A>to give help to each other whenever it was required and not to make war 
<A NAME="746"></A>or peace except in common; after which the Boeotians and Megarians, who 
<A NAME="747"></A>acted together, should make the alliance with Argos. But before the oaths 
<A NAME="748"></A>were taken the Boeotarchs communicated these proposals to the four councils 
<A NAME="749"></A>of the Boeotians, in whom the supreme power resides, and advised them to 
<A NAME="750"></A>interchange oaths with all such cities as should be willing to enter into 
<A NAME="751"></A>a defensive league with the Boeotians. But the members of the Boeotian 
<A NAME="752"></A>councils refused their assent to the proposal, being afraid of offending 
<A NAME="753"></A>Lacedaemon by entering into a league with the deserter Corinth; the Boeotarchs 
<A NAME="754"></A>not having acquainted them with what had passed at Lacedaemon and with 
<A NAME="755"></A>the advice given by Cleobulus and Xenares and the Boeotian partisans there, 
<A NAME="756"></A>namely, that they should become allies of Corinth and Argos as a preliminary 
<A NAME="757"></A>to a junction with Lacedaemon; fancying that, even if they should say nothing 
<A NAME="758"></A>about this, the councils would not vote against what had been decided and 
<A NAME="759"></A>advised by the Boeotarchs. This difficulty arising, the Corinthians and 
<A NAME="760"></A>the envoys from Thrace departed without anything having been concluded; 
<A NAME="761"></A>and the Boeotarchs, who had previously intended after carrying this to 
<A NAME="762"></A>try and effect the alliance with Argos, now omitted to bring the Argive 
<A NAME="763"></A>question before the councils, or to send to Argos the envoys whom they 
<A NAME="764"></A>had promised; and a general coldness and delay ensued in the 
<A NAME="765"></A>matter.
<A NAME="766"></A><BR><BR>In this same winter Mecyberna was assaulted and taken by the Olynthians, 
<A NAME="767"></A>having an Athenian garrison inside it.
<A NAME="768"></A><BR><BR>All this while negotiations had been going on between the Athenians 
<A NAME="769"></A>and Lacedaemonians about the conquests still retained by each, and Lacedaemon, 
<A NAME="770"></A>hoping that if Athens were to get back Panactum from the Boeotians she 
<A NAME="771"></A>might herself recover Pylos, now sent an embassy to the Boeotians, and 
<A NAME="772"></A>begged them to place Panactum and their Athenian prisoners in her hands, 
<A NAME="773"></A>in order that she might exchange them for Pylos. This the Boeotians refused 
<A NAME="774"></A>to do, unless Lacedaemon made a separate alliance with them as she had 
<A NAME="775"></A>done with Athens. Lacedaemon knew that this would be a breach of faith 
<A NAME="776"></A>to Athens, as it had been agreed that neither of them should make peace 
<A NAME="777"></A>or war without the other; yet wishing to obtain Panactum which she hoped 
<A NAME="778"></A>to exchange for Pylos, and the party who pressed for the dissolution of 
<A NAME="779"></A>the treaty strongly affecting the Boeotian connection, she at length concluded 
<A NAME="780"></A>the alliance just as winter gave way to spring; and Panactum was instantly 
<A NAME="781"></A>razed. And so the eleventh year of the war ended.
<A NAME="782"></A><BR><BR>In the first days of the summer following, the Argives, seeing 
<A NAME="783"></A>that the promised ambassadors from Boeotia did not arrive, and that Panactum 
<A NAME="784"></A>was being demolished, and that a separate alliance had been concluded between 
<A NAME="785"></A>the Boeotians and Lacedaemonians, began to be afraid that Argos might be 
<A NAME="786"></A>left alone, and all the confederacy go over to Lacedaemon. They fancied 
<A NAME="787"></A>that the Boeotians had been persuaded by the Lacedaemonians to raze Panactum 
<A NAME="788"></A>and to enter into the treaty with the Athenians, and that Athens was privy 
<A NAME="789"></A>to this arrangement, and even her alliance, therefore, no longer open to 
<A NAME="790"></A>them- a resource which they had always counted upon, by reason of the dissensions 
<A NAME="791"></A>existing, in the event of the noncontinuance of their treaty with Lacedaemon. 
<A NAME="792"></A>In this strait the Argives, afraid that, as the result of refusing to renew 
<A NAME="793"></A>the treaty with Lacedaemon and of aspiring to the supremacy in Peloponnese, 
<A NAME="794"></A>they would have the Lacedaemonians, Tegeans, Boeotians, and Athenians on 
<A NAME="795"></A>their hands all at once, now hastily sent off Eustrophus and Aeson, who 
<A NAME="796"></A>seemed the persons most likely to be acceptable, as envoys to Lacedaemon, 
<A NAME="797"></A>with the view of making as good a treaty as they could with the Lacedaemonians, 
<A NAME="798"></A>upon such terms as could be got, and being left in peace.
<A NAME="799"></A><BR><BR>Having reached Lacedaemon, their ambassadors proceeded to negotiate 
<A NAME="800"></A>the terms of the proposed treaty. What the Argives first demanded was that 
<A NAME="801"></A>they might be allowed to refer to the arbitration of some state or private 
<A NAME="802"></A>person the question of the Cynurian land, a piece of frontier territory 
<A NAME="803"></A>about which they have always been disputing, and which contains the towns 
<A NAME="804"></A>of Thyrea and Anthene, and is occupied by the Lacedaemonians. The Lacedaemonians 
<A NAME="805"></A>at first said that they could not allow this point to be discussed, but 
<A NAME="806"></A>were ready to conclude upon the old terms. Eventually, however, the Argive 
<A NAME="807"></A>ambassadors succeeded in obtaining from them this concession: For the present 
<A NAME="808"></A>there was to be a truce for fifty years, but it should be competent for 
<A NAME="809"></A>either party, there being neither plague nor war in Lacedaemon or Argos, 
<A NAME="810"></A>to give a formal challenge and decide the question of this territory by 
<A NAME="811"></A>battle, as on a former occasion, when both sides claimed the victory; pursuit 
<A NAME="812"></A>not being allowed beyond the frontier of Argos or Lacedaemon. The Lacedaemonians 
<A NAME="813"></A>at first thought this mere folly; but at last, anxious at any cost to have 
<A NAME="814"></A>the friendship of Argos they agreed to the terms demanded, and reduced 
<A NAME="815"></A>them to writing. However, before any of this should become binding, the 
<A NAME="816"></A>ambassadors were to return to Argos and communicate with their people and, 
<A NAME="817"></A>in the event of their approval, to come at the feast of the Hyacinthia 
<A NAME="818"></A>and take the oaths.
<A NAME="819"></A><BR><BR>The envoys returned accordingly. In the meantime, while the Argives 
<A NAME="820"></A>were engaged in these negotiations, the Lacedaemonian ambassadors- Andromedes, 
<A NAME="821"></A>Phaedimus, and Antimenidas- who were to receive the prisoners from the 
<A NAME="822"></A>Boeotians and restore them and Panactum to the Athenians, found that the 
<A NAME="823"></A>Boeotians had themselves razed Panactum, upon the plea that oaths had been 
<A NAME="824"></A>anciently exchanged between their people and the Athenians, after a dispute 
<A NAME="825"></A>on the subject to the effect that neither should inhabit the place, but 
<A NAME="826"></A>that they should graze it in common. As for the Athenian prisoners of war 
<A NAME="827"></A>in the hands of the Boeotians, these were delivered over to Andromedes 
<A NAME="828"></A>and his colleagues, and by them conveyed to Athens and given back. The 
<A NAME="829"></A>envoys at the same time announced the razing of Panactum, which to them 
<A NAME="830"></A>seemed as good as its restitution, as it would no longer lodge an enemy 
<A NAME="831"></A>of Athens. This announcement was received with great indignation by the 
<A NAME="832"></A>Athenians, who thought that the Lacedaemonians had played them false, both 
<A NAME="833"></A>in the matter of the demolition of Panactum, which ought to have been restored 
<A NAME="834"></A>to them standing, and in having, as they now heard, made a separate alliance 
<A NAME="835"></A>with the Boeotians, in spite of their previous promise to join Athens in 
<A NAME="836"></A>compelling the adhesion of those who refused to accede to the treaty. The 
<A NAME="837"></A>Athenians also considered the other points in which Lacedaemon had failed 
<A NAME="838"></A>in her compact, and thinking that they had been overreached, gave an angry 
<A NAME="839"></A>answer to the ambassadors and sent them away.
<A NAME="840"></A><BR><BR>The breach between the Lacedaemonians and Athenians having gone 
<A NAME="841"></A>thus far, the party at Athens, also, who wished to cancel the treaty, immediately 
<A NAME="842"></A>put themselves in motion. Foremost amongst these was Alcibiades, son of 
<A NAME="843"></A>Clinias, a man yet young in years for any other Hellenic city, but distinguished 
<A NAME="844"></A>by the splendour of his ancestry. Alcibiades thought the Argive alliance 
<A NAME="845"></A>really preferable, not that personal pique had not also a great deal to 
<A NAME="846"></A>do with his opposition; he being offended with the Lacedaemonians for having 
<A NAME="847"></A>negotiated the treaty through Nicias and Laches, and having overlooked 
<A NAME="848"></A>him on account of his youth, and also for not having shown him the respect 
<A NAME="849"></A>due to the ancient connection of his family with them as their proxeni, 
<A NAME="850"></A>which, renounced by his grandfather, he had lately himself thought to renew 
<A NAME="851"></A>by his attentions to their prisoners taken in the island. Being thus, as 
<A NAME="852"></A>he thought, slighted on all hands, he had in the first instance spoken 
<A NAME="853"></A>against the treaty, saying that the Lacedaemonians were not to be trusted, 
<A NAME="854"></A>but that they only treated, in order to be enabled by this means to crush 
<A NAME="855"></A>Argos, and afterwards to attack Athens alone; and now, immediately upon 
<A NAME="856"></A>the above occurring, he sent privately to the Argives, telling them to 
<A NAME="857"></A>come as quickly as possible to Athens, accompanied by the Mantineans and 
<A NAME="858"></A>Eleans, with proposals of alliance; as the moment was propitious and he 
<A NAME="859"></A>himself would do all he could to help them.
<A NAME="860"></A><BR><BR>Upon receiving this message and discovering that the Athenians, 
<A NAME="861"></A>far from being privy to the Boeotian alliance, were involved in a serious 
<A NAME="862"></A>quarrel with the Lacedaemonians, the Argives paid no further attention 
<A NAME="863"></A>to the embassy which they had just sent to Lacedaemon on the subject of 
<A NAME="864"></A>the treaty, and began to incline rather towards the Athenians, reflecting 
<A NAME="865"></A>that, in the event of war, they would thus have on their side a city that 
<A NAME="866"></A>was not only an ancient ally of Argos, but a sister democracy and very 
<A NAME="867"></A>powerful at sea. They accordingly at once sent ambassadors to Athens to 
<A NAME="868"></A>treat for an alliance, accompanied by others from Elis and 
<A NAME="869"></A>Mantinea.
<A NAME="870"></A><BR><BR>At the same time arrived in haste from Lacedaemon an embassy consisting 
<A NAME="871"></A>of persons reputed well disposed towards the Athenians- Philocharidas, 
<A NAME="872"></A>Leon, and Endius- for fear that the Athenians in their irritation might 
<A NAME="873"></A>conclude alliance with the Argives, and also to ask back Pylos in exchange 
<A NAME="874"></A>for Panactum, and in defence of the alliance with the Boeotians to plead 
<A NAME="875"></A>that it had not been made to hurt the Athenians. Upon the envoys speaking 
<A NAME="876"></A>in the senate upon these points, and stating that they had come with full 
<A NAME="877"></A>powers to settle all others at issue between them, Alcibiades became afraid 
<A NAME="878"></A>that, if they were to repeat these statements to the popular assembly, 
<A NAME="879"></A>they might gain the multitude, and the Argive alliance might be rejected, 
<A NAME="880"></A>and accordingly had recourse to the following stratagem. He persuaded the 
<A NAME="881"></A>Lacedaemonians by a solemn assurance that if they would say nothing of 
<A NAME="882"></A>their full powers in the assembly, he would give back Pylos to them (himself, 
<A NAME="883"></A>the present opponent of its restitution, engaging to obtain this from the 
<A NAME="884"></A>Athenians), and would settle the other points at issue. His plan was to 
<A NAME="885"></A>detach them from Nicias and to disgrace them before the people, as being 
<A NAME="886"></A>without sincerity in their intentions, or even common consistency in their 
<A NAME="887"></A>language, and so to get the Argives, Eleans, and Mantineans taken into 
<A NAME="888"></A>alliance. This plan proved successful. When the envoys appeared before 
<A NAME="889"></A>the people, and upon the question being put to them, did not say as they 
<A NAME="890"></A>had said in the senate, that they had come with full powers, the Athenians 
<A NAME="891"></A>lost all patience, and carried away by Alcibiades, who thundered more loudly 
<A NAME="892"></A>than ever against the Lacedaemonians, were ready instantly to introduce 
<A NAME="893"></A>the Argives and their companions and to take them into alliance. An earthquake, 
<A NAME="894"></A>however, occurring, before anything definite had been done, this assembly 
<A NAME="895"></A>was adjourned.
<A NAME="896"></A><BR><BR>In the assembly held the next day, Nicias, in spite of the Lacedaemonians 
<A NAME="897"></A>having been deceived themselves, and having allowed him to be deceived 
<A NAME="898"></A>also in not admitting that they had come with full powers, still maintained 
<A NAME="899"></A>that it was best to be friends with the Lacedaemonians, and, letting the 
<A NAME="900"></A>Argive proposals stand over, to send once more to Lacedaemon and learn 
<A NAME="901"></A>her intentions. The adjournment of the war could only increase their own 
<A NAME="902"></A>prestige and injure that of their rivals; the excellent state of their 
<A NAME="903"></A>affairs making it their interest to preserve this prosperity as long as 
<A NAME="904"></A>possible, while those of Lacedaemon were so desperate that the sooner she 
<A NAME="905"></A>could try her fortune again the better. He succeeded accordingly in persuading 
<A NAME="906"></A>them to send ambassadors, himself being among the number, to invite the 
<A NAME="907"></A>Lacedaemonians, if they were really sincere, to restore Panactum intact 
<A NAME="908"></A>with Amphipolis, and to abandon their alliance with the Boeotians (unless 
<A NAME="909"></A>they consented to accede to the treaty), agreeably to the stipulation which 
<A NAME="910"></A>forbade either to treat without the other. The ambassadors were also directed 
<A NAME="911"></A>to say that the Athenians, had they wished to play false, might already 
<A NAME="912"></A>have made alliance with the Argives, who were indeed come to Athens for 
<A NAME="913"></A>that very purpose, and went off furnished with instructions as to any other 
<A NAME="914"></A>complaints that the Athenians had to make. Having reached Lacedaemon, they 
<A NAME="915"></A>communicated their instructions, and concluded by telling the Lacedaemonians 
<A NAME="916"></A>that unless they gave up their alliance with the Boeotians, in the event 
<A NAME="917"></A>of their not acceding to the treaty, the Athenians for their part would 
<A NAME="918"></A>ally themselves with the Argives and their friends. The Lacedaemonians, 
<A NAME="919"></A>however, refused to give up the Boeotian alliance- the party of Xenares 
<A NAME="920"></A>the ephor, and such as shared their view, carrying the day upon this point- 
<A NAME="921"></A>but renewed the oaths at the request of Nicias, who feared to return without 
<A NAME="922"></A>having accomplished anything and to be disgraced; as was indeed his fate, 
<A NAME="923"></A>he being held the author of the treaty with Lacedaemon. When he returned, 
<A NAME="924"></A>and the Athenians heard that nothing had been done at Lacedaemon, they 
<A NAME="925"></A>flew into a passion, and deciding that faith had not been kept with them, 
<A NAME="926"></A>took advantage of the presence of the Argives and their allies, who had 
<A NAME="927"></A>been introduced by Alcibiades, and made a treaty and alliance with them 
<A NAME="928"></A>upon the terms following:
<A NAME="929"></A><BR><BR>The Athenians, Argives, Mantineans, and Eleans, acting for themselves 
<A NAME="930"></A>and the allies in their respective empires, made a treaty for a hundred 
<A NAME="931"></A>years, to be without fraud or hurt by land and by sea.
<A NAME="932"></A><BR><BR><B>1.</B> It shall not be lawful to carry on war, either for the 
<A NAME="933"></A>Argives, Eleans, Mantineans, and their allies, against the Athenians, or 
<A NAME="934"></A>the allies in the Athenian empire: or for the Athenians and their allies 
<A NAME="935"></A>against the Argives, Eleans, Mantineans, or their allies, in any way or 
<A NAME="936"></A>means whatsoever. The Athenians, Argives, Eleans, and Mantineans shall 
<A NAME="937"></A>be allies for a hundred years upon the terms following:
<A NAME="938"></A><BR><BR><B>2.</B> If an enemy invade the country of the Athenians, the 
<A NAME="939"></A>Argives, Eleans, and Mantineans shall go to the relief of Athens, according 
<A NAME="940"></A>as the Athenians may require by message, in such way as they most effectually 
<A NAME="941"></A>can, to the best of their power. But if the invader be gone after plundering 
<A NAME="942"></A>the territory, the offending state shall be the enemy of the Argives, Mantineans, 
<A NAME="943"></A>Eleans, and Athenians, and war shall be made against it by all these cities: 
<A NAME="944"></A>and no one of the cities shall be able to make peace with that state, except 
<A NAME="945"></A>all the above cities agree to do so.
<A NAME="946"></A><BR><BR><B>3.</B> Likewise the Athenians shall go to the relief of Argos, 
<A NAME="947"></A>Mantinea, and Elis, if an enemy invade the country of Elis, Mantinea, or 
<A NAME="948"></A>Argos, according as the above cities may require by message, in such way 
<A NAME="949"></A>as they most effectually can, to the best of their power. But if the invader 
<A NAME="950"></A>be gone after plundering the territory, the state offending shall be the 
<A NAME="951"></A>enemy of the Athenians, Argives, Mantineans, and Eleans, and war shall 
<A NAME="952"></A>be made against it by all these cities, and peace may not be made with 
<A NAME="953"></A>that state except all the above cities agree to it.
<A NAME="954"></A><BR><BR><B>4.</B> No armed force shall be allowed to pass for hostile purposes 
<A NAME="955"></A>through the country of the powers contracting, or of the allies in their 
<A NAME="956"></A>respective empires, or to go by sea, except all the cities- that is to 
<A NAME="957"></A>say, Athens, Argos, Mantinea, and Elis- vote for such 
<A NAME="958"></A>passage.
<A NAME="959"></A><BR><BR><B>5.</B> The relieving troops shall be maintained by the city 
<A NAME="960"></A>sending them for thirty days from their arrival in the city that has required 
<A NAME="961"></A>them, and upon their return in the same way: if their services be desired 
<A NAME="962"></A>for a longer period, the city that sent for them shall maintain them, at 
<A NAME="963"></A>the rate of three Aeginetan obols per day for a heavy-armed soldier, archer, 
<A NAME="964"></A>or light soldier, and an Aeginetan drachma for a trooper.
<A NAME="965"></A><BR><BR><B>6.</B> The city sending for the troops shall have the command 
<A NAME="966"></A>when the war is in its own country: but in case of the cities resolving 
<A NAME="967"></A>upon a joint expedition the command shall be equally divided among all 
<A NAME="968"></A>the cities.
<A NAME="969"></A><BR><BR><B>7.</B> The treaty shall be sworn to by the Athenians for themselves 
<A NAME="970"></A>and their allies, by the Argives, Mantineans, Eleans, and their allies, 
<A NAME="971"></A>by each state individually. Each shall swear the oath most binding in his 
<A NAME="972"></A>country over full-grown victims: the oath being as follows:
<A NAME="973"></A><BR><BR>"I STAND BY THE ALLIANCE AND ITS ARTICLES, JUSTLY, INNOCENTLY, 
<A NAME="974"></A>AND Sincerely, AND I WILL NOT TRANSGRESS THE SAME IN ANY WAY OR MEANS Whatsoever." 
<A NAME="975"></A>The oath shall taken at Athens by the Senate and the magistrates, the Prytanes 
<A NAME="976"></A>administering it: as by the Senate, the Eighty, and the Artynae, the Eighty 
<A NAME="977"></A>administering it: at Mantinea by the Demiurgi, the Senate, and the other 
<A NAME="978"></A>magistrates, the Theori and Polemarchs administering it: at Elis by the 
<A NAME="979"></A>Demiurgi, the magistrates, and the Six Hundred, the Demiurgi and the Thesmophylaces 
<A NAME="980"></A>administering it. The oaths shall be renewed by the Athenians going to 
<A NAME="981"></A>Elis, Mantinea, and Argos thirty days before the Olympic games: by the 
<A NAME="982"></A>Argives, Mantineans, and Eleans going to Athens ten days before the great 
<A NAME="983"></A>feast of the Panathenaea. The articles of the treaty, the oaths, and the 
<A NAME="984"></A>alliance shall be inscribed on a stone pillar by the Athenians in the citadel, 
<A NAME="985"></A>by the Argives in the market-place, in the temple of Apollo: by the Mantineans 
<A NAME="986"></A>in the temple of Zeus, in the market-place: and a brazen pillar shall be 
<A NAME="987"></A>erected jointly by them at the Olympic games now at hand. Should the above 
<A NAME="988"></A>cities see good to make any addition in these articies, whatever all the 
<A NAME="989"></A>above cities shall agree upon, after consulting together, shall be 
<A NAME="990"></A>binding.
<A NAME="991"></A><BR><BR>Although the treaty and alliances were thus concluded, still the 
<A NAME="992"></A>treaty between the Lacedaemonians and Athenians was not renounced by either 
<A NAME="993"></A>party. Meanwhile Corinth, although the ally of the Argives, did not accede 
<A NAME="994"></A>to the new treaty, any more than she had done to the alliance, defensive 
<A NAME="995"></A>and offensive, formed before this between the Eleans, Argives, and Mantineans, 
<A NAME="996"></A>when she declared herself content with the first alliance, which was defensive 
<A NAME="997"></A>only, and which bound them to help each other, but not to join in attacking 
<A NAME="998"></A>any. The Corinthians thus stood aloof from their allies, and again turned 
<A NAME="999"></A>their thoughts towards Lacedaemon.
<A NAME="1000"></A><BR><BR>At the Olympic games which were held this summer, and in which 
<A NAME="1001"></A>the Arcadian Androsthenes was victor the first time in the wrestling and 
<A NAME="1002"></A>boxing, the Lacedaemonians were excluded from the temple by the Eleans, 
<A NAME="1003"></A>and thus prevented from sacrificing or contending, for having refused to 
<A NAME="1004"></A>pay the fine specified in the Olympic law imposed upon them by the Eleans, 
<A NAME="1005"></A>who alleged that they had attacked Fort Phyrcus, and sent heavy infantry 
<A NAME="1006"></A>of theirs into Lepreum during the Olympic truce. The amount of the fine 
<A NAME="1007"></A>was two thousand minae, two for each heavy-armed soldier, as the law prescribes. 
<A NAME="1008"></A>The Lacedaemonians sent envoys, and pleaded that the imposition was unjust; 
<A NAME="1009"></A>saying that the truce had not yet been proclaimed at Lacedaemon when the 
<A NAME="1010"></A>heavy infantry were sent off. But the Eleans affirmed that the armistice 
<A NAME="1011"></A>with them had already begun (they proclaim it first among themselves), 
<A NAME="1012"></A>and that the aggression of the Lacedaemonians had taken them by surprise 
<A NAME="1013"></A>while they were living quietly as in time of peace, and not expecting anything. 
<A NAME="1014"></A>Upon this the Lacedaemonians submitted, that if the Eleans really believed 
<A NAME="1015"></A>that they had committed an aggression, it was useless after that to proclaim 
<A NAME="1016"></A>the truce at Lacedaemon; but they had proclaimed it notwithstanding, as 
<A NAME="1017"></A>believing nothing of the kind, and from that moment the Lacedaemonians 
<A NAME="1018"></A>had made no attack upon their country. Nevertheless the Eleans adhered 
<A NAME="1019"></A>to what they had said, that nothing would persuade them that an aggression 
<A NAME="1020"></A>had not been committed; if, however, the Lacedaemonians would restore Lepreum, 
<A NAME="1021"></A>they would give up their own share of the money and pay that of the god 
<A NAME="1022"></A>for them.
<A NAME="1023"></A><BR><BR>As this proposal was not accepted, the Eleans tried a second. Instead 
<A NAME="1024"></A>of restoring Lepreum, if this was objected to, the Lacedaemonians should 
<A NAME="1025"></A>ascend the altar of the Olympian Zeus, as they were so anxious to have 
<A NAME="1026"></A>access to the temple, and swear before the Hellenes that they would surely 
<A NAME="1027"></A>pay the fine at a later day. This being also refused, the Lacedaemonians 
<A NAME="1028"></A>were excluded from the temple, the sacrifice, and the games, and sacrificed 
<A NAME="1029"></A>at home; the Lepreans being the only other Hellenes who did not attend. 
<A NAME="1030"></A>Still the Eleans were afraid of the Lacedaemonians sacrificing by force, 
<A NAME="1031"></A>and kept guard with a heavy-armed company of their young men; being also 
<A NAME="1032"></A>joined by a thousand Argives, the same number of Mantineans, and by some 
<A NAME="1033"></A>Athenian cavalry who stayed at Harpina during the feast. Great fears were 
<A NAME="1034"></A>felt in the assembly of the Lacedaemonians coming in arms, especially after 
<A NAME="1035"></A>Lichas, son of Arcesilaus, a Lacedaemonian, had been scourged on the course 
<A NAME="1036"></A>by the umpires; because, upon his horses being the winners, and the Boeotian 
<A NAME="1037"></A>people being proclaimed the victor on account of his having no right to 
<A NAME="1038"></A>enter, he came forward on the course and crowned the charioteer, in order 
<A NAME="1039"></A>to show that the chariot was his. After this incident all were more afraid 
<A NAME="1040"></A>than ever, and firmly looked for a disturbance: the Lacedaemonians, however, 
<A NAME="1041"></A>kept quiet, and let the feast pass by, as we have seen. After the Olympic 
<A NAME="1042"></A>games, the Argives and the allies repaired to Corinth to invite her to 
<A NAME="1043"></A>come over to them. There they found some Lacedaemonian envoys; and a long 
<A NAME="1044"></A>discussion ensued, which after all ended in nothing, as an earthquake occurred, 
<A NAME="1045"></A>and they dispersed to their different homes.
<A NAME="1046"></A><BR><BR>Summer was now over. The winter following a battle took place between 
<A NAME="1047"></A>the Heracleots in Trachinia and the Aenianians, Dolopians, Malians, and 
<A NAME="1048"></A>certain of the Thessalians, all tribes bordering on and hostile to the 
<A NAME="1049"></A>town, which directly menaced their country. Accordingly, after having opposed 
<A NAME="1050"></A>and harassed it from its very foundation by every means in their power, 
<A NAME="1051"></A>they now in this battle defeated the Heracleots, Xenares, son of Cnidis, 
<A NAME="1052"></A>their Lacedaemonian commander, being among the slain. Thus the winter ended 
<A NAME="1053"></A>and the twelfth year of this war ended also. After the battle, Heraclea 
<A NAME="1054"></A>was so terribly reduced that in the first days of the summer following 
<A NAME="1055"></A>the Boeotians occupied the place and sent away the Lacedaemonian Agesippidas 
<A NAME="1056"></A>for misgovernment, fearing that the town might be taken by the Athenians 
<A NAME="1057"></A>while the Lacedaemonians were distracted with the affairs of Peloponnese. 
<A NAME="1058"></A>The Lacedaemonians, nevertheless, were offended with them for what they 
<A NAME="1059"></A>had done.
<A NAME="1060"></A><BR><BR>The same summer Alcibiades, son of Clinias, now one of the generals 
<A NAME="1061"></A>at Athens, in concert with the Argives and the allies, went into Peloponnese 
<A NAME="1062"></A>with a few Athenian heavy infantry and archers and some of the allies in 
<A NAME="1063"></A>those parts whom he took up as he passed, and with this army marched here 
<A NAME="1064"></A>and there through Peloponnese, and settled various matters connected with 
<A NAME="1065"></A>the alliance, and among other things induced the Patrians to carry their 
<A NAME="1066"></A>walls down to the sea, intending himself also to build a fort near the 
<A NAME="1067"></A>Achaean Rhium. However, the Corinthians and Sicyonians, and all others 
<A NAME="1068"></A>who would have suffered by its being built, came up and hindered 
<A NAME="1069"></A>him.
<A NAME="1070"></A><BR><BR>The same summer war broke out between the Epidaurians and Argives. 
<A NAME="1071"></A>The pretext was that the Epidaurians did not send an offering for their 
<A NAME="1072"></A>pasture-land to Apollo Pythaeus, as they were bound to do, the Argives 
<A NAME="1073"></A>having the chief management of the temple; but, apart from this pretext, 
<A NAME="1074"></A>Alcibiades and the Argives were determined, if possible, to gain possession 
<A NAME="1075"></A>of Epidaurus, and thus to ensure the neutrality of Corinth and give the 
<A NAME="1076"></A>Athenians a shorter passage for their reinforcements from Aegina than if 
<A NAME="1077"></A>they had to sail round Scyllaeum. The Argives accordingly prepared to invade 
<A NAME="1078"></A>Epidaurus by themselves, to exact the offering.
<A NAME="1079"></A><BR><BR>About the same time the Lacedaemonians marched out with all their 
<A NAME="1080"></A>people to Leuctra upon their frontier, opposite to Mount Lycaeum, under 
<A NAME="1081"></A>the command of Agis, son of Archidamus, without any one knowing their destination, 
<A NAME="1082"></A>not even the cities that sent the contingents. The sacrifices, however, 
<A NAME="1083"></A>for crossing the frontier not proving propitious, the Lacedaemonians returned 
<A NAME="1084"></A>home themselves, and sent word to the allie
