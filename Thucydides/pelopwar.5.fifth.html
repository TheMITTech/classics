<h2>THE FIFTH BOOK</h2>

<h3>Chapter XV</h3>

<p>Tenth Year of the War - Death of Cleon and Brasidas - Peace of Nicias</p>

<p>The next summer the truce for a year ended, after lasting until the
Pythian games. During the armistice the Athenians expelled the Delians
from Delos, concluding that they must have been polluted by some old
offence at the time of their consecration, and that this had been
the omission in the previous purification of the island, which, as
I have related, had been thought to have been duly accomplished by
the removal of the graves of the dead. The Delians had Atramyttium
in Asia given them by Pharnaces, and settled there as they removed
from Delos.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Cleon prevailed on the Athenians to let him set sail at
the expiration of the armistice for the towns in the direction of
Thrace with twelve hundred heavy infantry and three hundred horse
from Athens, a large force of the allies, and thirty ships. First
touching at the still besieged Scione, and taking some heavy infantry
from the army there, he next sailed into Cophos, a harbour in the
territory of Torone, which is not far from the town. From thence,
having learnt from deserters that Brasidas was not in Torone, and
that its garrison was not strong enough to give him battle, he advanced
with his army against the town, sending ten ships to sail round into
the harbour. He first came to the fortification lately thrown up in
front of the town by Brasidas in order to take in the suburb, to do
which he had pulled down part of the original wall and made it all
one city. To this point Pasitelidas, the Lacedaemonian commander,
with such garrison as there was in the place, hurried to repel the
Athenian assault; but finding himself hard pressed, and seeing the
ships that had been sent round sailing into the harbour, Pasitelidas
began to be afraid that they might get up to the city before its defenders
were there and, the fortification being also carried, he might be
taken prisoner, and so abandoned the outwork and ran into the town.
But the Athenians from the ships had already taken Torone, and their
land forces following at his heels burst in with him with a rush over
the part of the old wall that had been pulled down, killing some of
the Peloponnesians and Toronaeans in the melee, and making prisoners
of the rest, and Pasitelidas their commander amongst them. Brasidas
meanwhile had advanced to relieve Torone, and had only about four
miles more to go when he heard of its fall on the road, and turned
back again. Cleon and the Athenians set up two trophies, one by the
harbour, the other by the fortification and, making slaves of the
wives and children of the Toronaeans, sent the men with the Peloponnesians
and any Chalcidians that were there, to the number of seven hundred,
to Athens; whence, however, they all came home afterwards, the Peloponnesians
on the conclusion of peace, and the rest by being exchanged against
other prisoners with the Olynthians. About the same time Panactum,
a fortress on the Athenian border, was taken by treachery by the Boeotians.
Meanwhile Cleon, after placing a garrison in Torone, weighed anchor
and sailed around Athos on his way to Amphipolis.</p>

<p>About the same time Phaeax, son of Erasistratus, set sail with two
colleagues as ambassador from Athens to Italy and Sicily. The Leontines,
upon the departure of the Athenians from Sicily after the pacification,
had placed a number of new citizens upon the roll, and the commons
had a design for redividing the land; but the upper classes, aware
of their intention, called in the Syracusans and expelled the commons.
These last were scattered in various directions; but the upper classes
came to an agreement with the Syracusans, abandoned and laid waste
their city, and went and lived at Syracuse, where they were made citizens.
Afterwards some of them were dissatisfied, and leaving Syracuse occupied
Phocaeae, a quarter of the town of Leontini, and Bricinniae, a strong
place in the Leontine country, and being there joined by most of the
exiled commons carried on war from the fortifications. The Athenians
hearing this, sent Phaeax to see if they could not by some means so
convince their allies there and the rest of the Sicilians of the ambitious
designs of Syracuse as to induce them to form a general coalition
against her, and thus save the commons of Leontini. Arrived in Sicily,
Phaeax succeeded at Camarina and Agrigentum, but meeting with a repulse
at Gela did not go on to the rest, as he saw that he should not succeed
with them, but returned through the country of the Sicels to Catana,
and after visiting Bricinniae as he passed, and encouraging its inhabitants,
sailed back to Athens.</p>

<p>During his voyage along the coast to and from Sicily, he treated with
some cities in Italy on the subject of friendship with Athens, and
also fell in with some Locrian settlers exiled from Messina, who had
been sent thither when the Locrians were called in by one of the factions
that divided Messina after the pacification of Sicily, and Messina
came for a time into the hands of the Locrians. These being met by
Phaeax on their return home received no injury at his hands, as the
Locrians had agreed with him for a treaty with Athens. They were the
only people of the allies who, when the reconciliation between the
Sicilians took place, had not made peace with her; nor indeed would
they have done so now, if they had not been pressed by a war with
the Hipponians and Medmaeans who lived on their border, and were colonists
of theirs. Phaeax meanwhile proceeded on his voyage, and at length
arrived at Athens.</p>

<p>Cleon, whom we left on his voyage from Torone to Amphipolis, made
Eion his base, and after an unsuccessful assault upon the Andrian
colony of Stagirus, took Galepsus, a colony of Thasos, by storm. He
now sent envoys to Perdiccas to command his attendance with an army,
as provided by the alliance; and others to Thrace, to Polles, king
of the Odomantians, who was to bring as many Thracian mercenaries
as possible; and himself remained inactive in Eion, awaiting their
arrival. Informed of this, Brasidas on his part took up a position
of observation upon Cerdylium, a place situated in the Argilian country
on high ground across the river, not far from Amphipolis, and commanding
a view on all sides, and thus made it impossible for Cleon's army
to move without his seeing it; for he fully expected that Cleon, despising
the scanty numbers of his opponent, would march against Amphipolis
with the force that he had got with him. At the same time Brasidas
made his preparations, calling to his standard fifteen hundred Thracian
mercenaries and all the Edonians, horse and targeteers; he also had
a thousand Myrcinian and Chalcidian targeteers, besides those in Amphipolis,
and a force of heavy infantry numbering altogether about two thousand,
and three hundred Hellenic horse. Fifteen hundred of these he had
with him upon Cerdylium; the rest were stationed with Clearidas in
Amphipolis.</p>

<p>After remaining quiet for some time, Cleon was at length obliged to
do as Brasidas expected. His soldiers, tired of their inactivity,
began also seriously to reflect on the weakness and incompetence of
their commander, and the skill and valour that would be opposed to
him, and on their own original unwillingness to accompany him. These
murmurs coming to the ears of Cleon, he resolved not to disgust the
army by keeping it in the same place, and broke up his camp and advanced.
The temper of the general was what it had been at Pylos, his success
on that occasion having given him confidence in his capacity. He never
dreamed of any one coming out to fight him, but said that he was rather
going up to view the place; and if he waited for his reinforcements,
it was not in order to make victory secure in case he should be compelled
to engage, but to be enabled to surround and storm the city. He accordingly
came and posted his army upon a strong hill in front of Amphipolis,
and proceeded to examine the lake formed by the Strymon, and how the
town lay on the side of Thrace. He thought to retire at pleasure without
fighting, as there was no one to be seen upon the wall or coming out
of the gates, all of which were shut. Indeed, it seemed a mistake
not to have brought down engines with him; he could then have taken
the town, there being no one to defend it.</p>

<p>As soon as Brasidas saw the Athenians in motion he descended himself
from Cerdylium and entered Amphipolis. He did not venture to go out
in regular order against the Athenians: he mistrusted his strength,
and thought it inadequate to the attempt; not in numbers- these were
not so unequal- but in quality, the flower of the Athenian army being
in the field, with the best of the Lemnians and Imbrians. He therefore
prepared to assail them by stratagem. By showing the enemy the number
of his troops, and the shifts which he had been put to to to arm them,
he thought that he should have less chance of beating him than by
not letting him have a sight of them, and thus learn how good a right
he had to despise them. He accordingly picked out a hundred and fifty
heavy infantry and, putting the rest under Clearidas, determined to
attack suddenly before the Athenians retired; thinking that he should
not have again such a chance of catching them alone, if their reinforcements
were once allowed to come up; and so calling all his soldiers together
in order to encourage them and explain his intention, spoke as follows:</p>

<p>"Peloponnesians, the character of the country from which we have come,
one which has always owed its freedom to valour, and the fact that
you are Dorians and the enemy you are about to fight Ionians, whom
you are accustomed to beat, are things that do not need further comment.
But the plan of attack that I propose to pursue, this it is as well
to explain, in order that the fact of our adventuring with a part
instead of with the whole of our forces may not damp your courage
by the apparent disadvantage at which it places you. I imagine it
is the poor opinion that he has of us, and the fact that he has no
idea of any one coming out to engage him, that has made the enemy
march up to the place and carelessly look about him as he is doing,
without noticing us. But the most successful soldier will always be
the man who most happily detects a blunder like this, and who carefully
consulting his own means makes his attack not so much by open and
regular approaches, as by seizing the opportunity of the moment; and
these stratagems, which do the greatest service to our friends by
most completely deceiving our enemies, have the most brilliant name
in war. Therefore, while their careless confidence continues, and
they are still thinking, as in my judgment they are now doing, more
of retreat than of maintaining their position, while their spirit
is slack and not high-strung with expectation, I with the men under
my command will, if possible, take them by surprise and fall with
a run upon their centre; and do you, Clearidas, afterwards, when you
see me already upon them, and, as is likely, dealing terror among
them, take with you the Amphipolitans, and the rest of the allies,
and suddenly open the gates and dash at them, and hasten to engage
as quickly as you can. That is our best chance of establishing a panic
among them, as a fresh assailant has always more terrors for an enemy
than the one he is immediately engaged with. Show yourself a brave
man, as a Spartan should; and do you, allies, follow him like men,
and remember that zeal, honour, and obedience mark the good soldier,
and that this day will make you either free men and allies of Lacedaemon,
or slaves of Athens; even if you escape without personal loss of liberty
or life, your bondage will be on harsher terms than before, and you
will also hinder the liberation of the rest of the Hellenes. No cowardice
then on your part, seeing the greatness of the issues at stake, and
I will show that what I preach to others I can practise myself."</p>

<p>After this brief speech Brasidas himself prepared for the sally, and
placed the rest with Clearidas at the Thracian gates to support him
as had been agreed. Meanwhile he had been seen coming down from Cerdylium
and then in the city, which is overlooked from the outside, sacrificing
near the temple of Athene; in short, all his movements had been observed,
and word was brought to Cleon, who had at the moment gone on to look
about him, that the whole of the enemy's force could be seen in the
town, and that the feet of horses and men in great numbers were visible
under the gates, as if a sally were intended. Upon hearing this he
went up to look, and having done so, being unwilling to venture upon
the decisive step of a battle before his reinforcements came up, and
fancying that he would have time to retire, bid the retreat be sounded
and sent orders to the men to effect it by moving on the left wing
in the direction of Eion, which was indeed the only way practicable.
This however not being quick enough for him, he joined the retreat
in person and made the right wing wheel round, thus turning its unarmed
side to the enemy. It was then that Brasidas, seeing the Athenian
force in motion and his opportunity come, said to the men with him
and the rest: "Those fellows will never stand before us, one can see
that by the way their spears and heads are going. Troops which do
as they do seldom stand a charge. Quick, someone, and open the gates
I spoke of, and let us be out and at them with no fears for the result."
Accordingly issuing out by the palisade gate and by the first in the
long wall then existing, he ran at the top of his speed along the
straight road, where the trophy now stands as you go by the steepest
part of the hill, and fell upon and routed the centre of the Athenians,
panic-stricken by their own disorder and astounded at his audacity.
At the same moment Clearidas in execution of his orders issued out
from the Thracian gates to support him, and also attacked the enemy.
The result was that the Athenians, suddenly and unexpectedly attacked
on both sides, fell into confusion; and their left towards Eion, which
had already got on some distance, at once broke and fled. Just as
it was in full retreat and Brasidas was passing on to attack the right,
he received a wound; but his fall was not perceived by the Athenians,
as he was taken up by those near him and carried off the field. The
Athenian right made a better stand, and though Cleon, who from the
first had no thought of fighting, at once fled and was overtaken and
slain by a Myrcinian targeteer, his infantry forming in close order
upon the hill twice or thrice repulsed the attacks of Clearidas, and
did not finally give way until they were surrounded and routed by
the missiles of the Myrcinian and Chalcidian horse and the targeteers.
Thus the Athenian army was all now in flight; and such as escaped
being killed in the battle, or by the Chalcidian horse and the targeteers,
dispersed among the hills, and with difficulty made their way to Eion.
The men who had taken up and rescued Brasidas, brought him into the
town with the breath still in him: he lived to hear of the victory
of his troops, and not long after expired. The rest of the army returning
with Clearidas from the pursuit stripped the dead and set up a trophy.
After this all the allies attended in arms and buried Brasidas at
the public expense in the city, in front of what is now the marketplace,
and the Amphipolitans, having enclosed his tomb, ever afterwards sacrifice
to him as a hero and have given to him the honour of games and annual
offerings. They constituted him the founder of their colony, and pulled
down the Hagnonic erections, and obliterated everything that could
be interpreted as a memorial of his having founded the place; for
they considered that Brasidas had been their preserver, and courting
as they did the alliance of Lacedaemon for fear of Athens, in their
present hostile relations with the latter they could no longer with
the same advantage or satisfaction pay Hagnon his honours. They also
gave the Athenians back their dead. About six hundred of the latter
had fallen and only seven of the enemy, owing to there having been
no regular engagement, but the affair of accident and panic that I
have described. After taking up their dead the Athenians sailed off
home, while Clearidas and his troops remained to arrange matters at
Amphipolis.</p>

<p>About the same time three Lacedaemonians- Ramphias, Autocharidas,
and Epicydidas- led a reinforcement of nine hundred heavy infantry
to the towns in the direction of Thrace, and arriving at Heraclea
in Trachis reformed matters there as seemed good to them. While they
delayed there, this battle took place and so the summer ended.</p>

<p>With the beginning of the winter following, Ramphias and his companions
penetrated as far as Pierium in Thessaly; but as the Thessalians opposed
their further advance, and Brasidas whom they came to reinforce was
dead, they turned back home, thinking that the moment had gone by,
the Athenians being defeated and gone, and themselves not equal to
the execution of Brasidas's designs. The main cause however of their
return was because they knew that when they set out Lacedaemonian
opinion was really in favour of peace.</p>

<p>Indeed it so happened that directly after the battle of Amphipolis
and the retreat of Ramphias from Thessaly, both sides ceased to prosecute
the war and turned their attention to peace. Athens had suffered severely
at Delium, and again shortly afterwards at Amphipolis, and had no
longer that confidence in her strength which had made her before refuse
to treat, in the belief of ultimate victory which her success at the
moment had inspired; besides, she was afraid of her allies being tempted
by her reverses to rebel more generally, and repented having let go
the splendid opportunity for peace which the affair of Pylos had offered.
Lacedaemon, on the other hand, found the event of the war to falsify
her notion that a few years would suffice for the overthrow of the
power of the Athenians by the devastation of their land. She had suffered
on the island a disaster hitherto unknown at Sparta; she saw her country
plundered from Pylos and Cythera; the Helots were deserting, and she
was in constant apprehension that those who remained in Peloponnese
would rely upon those outside and take advantage of the situation
to renew their old attempts at revolution. Besides this, as chance
would have it, her thirty years' truce with the Argives was upon the
point of expiring; and they refused to renew it unless Cynuria were
restored to them; so that it seemed impossible to fight Argos and
Athens at once. She also suspected some of the cities in Peloponnese
of intending to go over to the endeed was indeed the case.</p>

<p>These considerations made both sides disposed for an accommodation;
the Lacedaemonians being probably the most eager, as they ardently
desired to recover the men taken upon the island, the Spartans among
whom belonged to the first families and were accordingly related to
the governing body in Lacedaemon. Negotiations had been begun directly
after their capture, but the Athenians in their hour of triumph would
not consent to any reasonable terms; though after their defeat at
Delium, Lacedaemon, knowing that they would be now more inclined to
listen, at once concluded the armistice for a year, during which they
were to confer together and see if a longer period could not be agreed
upon.</p>

<p>Now, however, after the Athenian defeat at Amphipolis, and the death
of Cleon and Brasidas, who had been the two principal opponents of
peace on either side- the latter from the success and honour which
war gave him, the former because he thought that, if tranquillity
were restored, his crimes would be more open to detection and his
slanders less credited- the foremost candidates for power in either
city, Pleistoanax, son of Pausanias, king of Lacedaemon, and Nicias,
son of Niceratus, the most fortunate general of his time, each desired
peace more ardently than ever. Nicias, while still happy and honoured,
wished to secure his good fortune, to obtain a present release from
trouble for himself and his countrymen, and hand down to posterity
a name as an ever-successful statesman, and thought the way to do
this was to keep out of danger and commit himself as little as possible
to fortune, and that peace alone made this keeping out of danger possible.
Pleistoanax, again, was assailed by his enemies for his restoration,
and regularly held up by them to the prejudice of his countrymen,
upon every reverse that befell them, as though his unjust restoration
were the cause; the accusation being that he and his brother Aristocles
had bribed the prophetess of Delphi to tell the Lacedaemonian deputations
which successively arrived at the temple to bring home the seed of
the demigod son of Zeus from abroad, else they would have to plough
with a silver share. In this way, it was insisted, in time he had
induced the Lacedaemonians in the nineteenth year of his exile to
Lycaeum (whither he had gone when banished on suspicion of having
been bribed to retreat from Attica, and had built half his house within
the consecrated precinct of Zeus for fear of the Lacedaemonians),
to restore him with the same dances and sacrifices with which they
had instituted their kings upon the first settlement of Lacedaemon.
The smart of this accusation, and the reflection that in peace no
disaster could occur, and that when Lacedaemon had recovered her men
there would be nothing for his enemies to take hold of (whereas, while
war lasted, the highest station must always bear the scandal of everything
that went wrong), made him ardently desire a settlement. Accordingly
this winter was employed in conferences; and as spring rapidly approached,
the Lacedaemonians sent round orders to the cities to prepare for
a fortified occupation of Attica, and held this as a sword over the
heads of the Athenians to induce them to listen to their overtures;
and at last, after many claims had been urged on either side at the
conferences a peace was agreed on upon the following basis. Each party
was to restore its conquests, but Athens was to keep Nisaea; her demand
for Plataea being met by the Thebans asserting that they had acquired
the place not by force or treachery, but by the voluntary adhesion
upon agreement of its citizens; and the same, according to the Athenian
account, being the history of her acquisition of Nisaea. This arranged,
the Lacedaemonians summoned their allies, and all voting for peace
except the Boeotians, Corinthians, Eleans, and Megarians, who did
not approve of these proceedings, they concluded the treaty and made
peace, each of the contracting parties swearing to the following articles:</p>

<p>The Athenians and Lacedaemonians and their allies made a treaty, and
swore to it, city by city, as follows;</p>

<p>1. Touching the national temples, there shall be a free passage by
land and by sea to all who wish it, to sacrifice, travel, consult,
and attend the oracle or games, according to the customs of their
countries.</p>

<p>2. The temple and shrine of Apollo at Delphi and the Delphians shall
be governed by their own laws, taxed by their own state, and judged
by their own judges, the land and the people, according to the custom
of their country.</p>

<p>3. The treaty shall be binding for fifty years upon the Athenians
and the allies of the Athenians, and upon the Lacedaemonians and the
allies of the Lacedaemonians, without fraud or hurt by land or by
sea.</p>

<p>4. It shall not be lawful to take up arms, with intent to do hurt,
either for the Lacedaemonians and their allies against the Athenians
and their allies, or for the Athenians and their allies against the
Lacedaemonians and their allies, in any way or means whatsoever. But
should any difference arise between them they are to have recourse
to law and oaths, according as may be agreed between the parties.</p>

<p>5. The Lacedaemonians and their allies shall give back Amphipolis
to the Athenians. Nevertheless, in the case of cities given up by
the Lacedaemonians to the Athenians, the inhabitants shall be allowed
to go where they please and to take their property with them: and
the cities shall be independent, paying only the tribute of Aristides.
And it shall not be lawful for the Athenians or their allies to carry
on war against them after the treaty has been concluded, so long as
the tribute is paid. The cities referred to are Argilus, Stagirus,
Acanthus, Scolus, Olynthus, and Spartolus. These cities shall be neutral,
allies neither of the Lacedaemonians nor of the Athenians: but if
the cities consent, it shall be lawful for the Athenians to make them
their allies, provided always that the cities wish it. The Mecybernaeans,
Sanaeans, and Singaeans shall inhabit their own cities, as also the
Olynthians and Acanthians: but the Lacedaemonians and their allies
shall give back Panactum to the Athenians.</p>

<p>6. The Athenians shall give back Coryphasium, Cythera, Methana, Pteleum,
and Atalanta to the Lacedaemonians, and also all Lacedaemonians that
are in the prison at Athens or elsewhere in the Athenian dominions,
and shall let go the Peloponnesians besieged in Scione, and all others
in Scione that are allies of the Lacedaemonians, and all whom Brasidas
sent in there, and any others of the allies of the Lacedaemonians
that may be in the prison at Athens or elsewhere in the Athenian dominions.</p>

<p>7. The Lacedaemonians and their allies shall in like manner give back
any of the Athenians or their allies that they may have in their hands.</p>

<p>8. In the case of Scione, Torone, and Sermylium, and any other cities
that the Athenians may have, the Athenians may adopt such measures
as they please.</p>

<p>9. The Athenians shall take an oath to the Lacedaemonians and their
allies, city by city. Every man shall swear by the most binding oath
of his country, seventeen from each city. The oath shall be as follows;
"I will abide by this agreement and treaty honestly and without deceit."
In the same way an oath shall be taken by the Lacedaemonians and their
allies to the Athenians: and the oath shall be renewed annually by
both parties. Pillars shall be erected at Olympia, Pythia, the Isthmus,
at Athens in the Acropolis, and at Lacedaemon in the temple at Amyclae.</p>

<p>10. If anything be forgotten, whatever it be, and on whatever point,
it shall be consistent with their oath for both parties, the Athenians
and Lacedaemonians, to alter it, according to their discretion.</p>

<p>The treaty begins from the ephoralty of Pleistolas in Lacedaemon,
on the 27th day of the month of Artemisium, and from the archonship,
of Alcaeus at Athens, on the 25th day of the month of Elaphebolion.
Those who took the oath and poured the libations for the Lacedaemonians
were Pleistoanax, Agis, Pleistolas, Damagetis, Chionis, Metagenes,
Acanthus, Daithus, Ischagoras, Philocharidas, Zeuxidas, Antippus,
Tellis, Alcinadas, Empedias, Menas, and Laphilus: for the Athenians,
Lampon, Isthmonicus, Nicias, Laches, Euthydemus, Procles, Pythodorus,
Hagnon, Myrtilus, Thrasycles, Theagenes, Aristocrates, Iolcius, Timocrates,
Leon, Lamachus, and Demosthenes.</p>

<p>This treaty was made in the spring, just at the end of winter, directly
after the city festival of Dionysus, just ten years, with the difference
of a few days, from the first invasion of Attica and the commencement
of this war. This must be calculated by the seasons rather than by
trusting to the enumeration of the names of the several magistrates
or offices of honour that are used to mark past events. Accuracy is
impossible where an event may have occurred in the beginning, or middle,
or at any period in their tenure of office. But by computing by summers
and winters, the method adopted in this history, it will be found
that, each of these amounting to half a year, there were ten summers
and as many winters contained in this first war.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Lacedaemonians, to whose lot it fell to begin the work
of restitution, immediately set free all the prisoners of war in their
possession, and sent Ischagoras, Menas, and Philocharidas as envoys
to the towns in the direction of Thrace, to order Clearidas to hand
over Amphipolis to the Athenians, and the rest of their allies each
to accept the treaty as it affected them. They, however, did not like
its terms, and refused to accept it; Clearidas also, willing to oblige
the Chalcidians, would not hand over the town, averring his inability
to do so against their will. Meanwhile he hastened in person to Lacedaemon
with envoys from the place, to defend his disobedience against the
possible accusations of Ischagoras and his companions, and also to
see whether it was too late for the agreement to be altered; and on
finding the Lacedaemonians were bound, quickly set out back again
with instructions from them to hand over the place, if possible, or
at all events to bring out the Peloponnesians that were in it.</p>

<p>The allies happened to be present in person at Lacedaemon, and those
who had not accepted the treaty were now asked by the Lacedaemonians
to adopt it. This, however, they refused to do, for the same reasons
as before, unless a fairer one than the present were agreed upon;
and remaining firm in their determination were dismissed by the Lacedaemonians,
who now decided on forming an alliance with the Athenians, thinking
that Argos, who had refused the application of Ampelidas and Lichas
for a renewal of the treaty, would without Athens be no longer formidable,
and that the rest of the Peloponnese would be most likely to keep
quiet, if the coveted alliance of Athens were shut against them. Accordingly,
after conference with the Athenian ambassadors, an alliance was agreed
upon and oaths were exchanged, upon the terms following:</p>

<p>1. The Lacedaemonians shall be allies of the Athenians for fifty years.</p>

<p>2. Should any enemy invade the territory of Lacedaemon and injure
the Lacedaemonians, the Athenians shall help in such way as they most
effectively can, according to their power. But if the invader be gone
after plundering the country, that city shall be the enemy of Lacedaemon
and Athens, and shall be chastised by both, and one shall not make
peace without the other. This to be honestly, loyally, and without
fraud.</p>

<p>3. Should any enemy invade the territory of Athens and injure the
Athenians, the Lacedaemonians shall help them in such way as they
most effectively can, according to their power. But if the invader
be gone after plundering the country, that city shall be the enemy
of Lacedaemon and Athens, and shall be chastised by both, and one
shall not make peace without the other. This to be honestly, loyally,
and without fraud.</p>

<p>4. Should the slave population rise, the Athenians shall help the
Lacedaemonians with all their might, according to their power.</p>

<p>5. This treaty shall be sworn to by the same persons on either side
that swore to the other. It shall be renewed annually by the Lacedaemonians
going to Athens for the Dionysia, and the Athenians to Lacedaemon
for the Hyacinthia, and a pillar shall be set up by either party:
at Lacedaemon near the statue of Apollo at Amyclae, and at Athens
on the Acropolis near the statue of Athene. Should the Lacedaemonians
and Athenians see to add to or take away from the alliance in any
particular, it shall be consistent with their oaths for both parties
to do so, according to their discretion.</p>

<p>Those who took the oath for the Lacedaemonians were Pleistoanax, Agis,
Pleistolas, Damagetus, Chionis, Metagenes, Acanthus, Daithus, Ischagoras,
Philocharidas, Zeuxidas, Antippus, Alcinadas, Tellis, Empedias, Menas,
and Laphilus; for the Athenians, Lampon, Isthmionicus, Laches, Nicias,
Euthydemus, Procles, Pythodorus, Hagnon, Myrtilus, Thrasycles, Theagenes,
Aristocrates, Iolcius, Timocrates, Leon, Lamachus, and Demosthenes.</p>

<p>This alliance was made not long after the treaty; and the Athenians
gave back the men from the island to the Lacedaemonians, and the summer
of the eleventh year began. This completes the history of the first
war, which occupied the whole of the ten years previously.</p>

<h3>Chapter XVI</h3>

<p>Feeling against Sparta in Peloponnese - League of the Mantineans,
Eleans, Argives, and Athenians - Battle of Mantinea and breaking up
of the League</p>

<p>After the treaty and the alliance between the Lacedaemonians and Athenians,
concluded after the ten years' war, in the ephorate of Pleistolas
at Lacedaemon, and the archonship of Alcaeus at Athens, the states
which had accepted them were at peace; but the Corinthians and some
of the cities in Peloponnese trying to disturb the settlement, a fresh
agitation was instantly commenced by the allies against Lacedaemon.
Further, the Lacedaemonians, as time went on, became suspected by
the Athenians through their not performing some of the provisions
in the treaty; and though for six years and ten months they abstained
from invasion of each other's territory, yet abroad an unstable armistice
did not prevent either party doing the other the most effectual injury,
until they were finally obliged to break the treaty made after the
ten years' war and to have recourse to open hostilities.</p>

<p>The history of this period has been also written by the same Thucydides,
an Athenian, in the chronological order of events by summers and winters,
to the time when the Lacedaemonians and their allies put an end to
the Athenian empire, and took the Long Walls and Piraeus. The war
had then lasted for twenty-seven years in all. Only a mistaken judgment
can object to including the interval of treaty in the war. Looked
at by the light of facts it cannot, it will be found, be rationally
considered a state of peace, where neither party either gave or got
back all that they had agreed, apart from the violations of it which
occurred on both sides in the Mantinean and Epidaurian wars and other
instances, and the fact that the allies in the direction of Thrace
were in as open hostility as ever, while the Boeotians had only a
truce renewed every ten days. So that the first ten years' war, the
treacherous armistice that followed it, and the subsequent war will,
calculating by the seasons, be found to make up the number of years
which I have mentioned, with the difference of a few days, and to
afford an instance of faith in oracles being for once justified by
the event. I certainly all along remember from the beginning to the
end of the war its being commonly declared that it would last thrice
nine years. I lived through the whole of it, being of an age to comprehend
events, and giving my attention to them in order to know the exact
truth about them. It was also my fate to be an exile from my country
for twenty years after my command at Amphipolis; and being present
with both parties, and more especially with the Peloponnesians by
reason of my exile, I had leisure to observe affairs somewhat particularly.
I will accordingly now relate the differences that arose after the
ten years' war, the breach of the treaty, and the hostilities that
followed.</p>

<p>After the conclusion of the fifty years' truce and of the subsequent
alliance, the embassies from Peloponnese which had been summoned for
this business returned from Lacedaemon. The rest went straight home,
but the Corinthians first turned aside to Argos and opened negotiations
with some of the men in office there, pointing out that Lacedaemon
could have no good end in view, but only the subjugation of Peloponnese,
or she would never have entered into treaty and alliance with the
once detested Athenians, and that the duty of consulting for the safety
of Peloponnese had now fallen upon Argos, who should immediately pass
a decree inviting any Hellenic state that chose, such state being
independent and accustomed to meet fellow powers upon the fair and
equal ground of law and justice, to make a defensive alliance with
the Argives; appointing a few individuals with plenipotentiary powers,
instead of making the people the medium of negotiation, in order that,
in the case of an applicant being rejected, the fact of his overtures
might not be made public. They said that many would come over from
hatred of the Lacedaemonians. After this explanation of their views,
the Corinthians returned home.</p>

<p>The persons with whom they had communicated reported the proposal
to their government and people, and the Argives passed the decree
and chose twelve men to negotiate an alliance for any Hellenic state
that wished it, except Athens and Lacedaemon, neither of which should
be able to join without reference to the Argive people. Argos came
into the plan the more readily because she saw that war with Lacedaemon
was inevitable, the truce being on the point of expiring; and also
because she hoped to gain the supremacy of Peloponnese. For at this
time Lacedaemon had sunk very low in public estimation because of
her disasters, while the Argives were in a most flourishing condition,
having taken no part in the Attic war, but having on the contrary
profited largely by their neutrality. The Argives accordingly prepared
to receive into alliance any of the Hellenes that desired it.</p>

<p>The Mantineans and their allies were the first to come over through
fear of the Lacedaemonians. Having taken advantage of the war against
Athens to reduce a large part of Arcadia into subjection, they thought
that Lacedaemon would not leave them undisturbed in their conquests,
now that she had leisure to interfere, and consequently gladly turned
to a powerful city like Argos, the historical enemy of the Lacedaemonians,
and a sister democracy. Upon the defection of Mantinea, the rest of
Peloponnese at once began to agitate the propriety of following her
example, conceiving that the Mantineans not have changed sides without
good reason; besides which they were angry with Lacedaemon among other
reasons for having inserted in the treaty with Athens that it should
be consistent with their oaths for both parties, Lacedaemonians and
Athenians, to add to or take away from it according to their discretion.
It was this clause that was the real origin of the panic in Peloponnese,
by exciting suspicions of a Lacedaemonian and Athenian combination
against their liberties: any alteration should properly have been
made conditional upon the consent of the whole body of the allies.
With these apprehensions there was a very general desire in each state
to place itself in alliance with Argos.</p>

<p>In the meantime the Lacedaemonians perceiving the agitation going
on in Peloponnese, and that Corinth was the author of it and was herself
about to enter into alliance with the Argives, sent ambassadors thither
in the hope of preventing what was in contemplation. They accused
her of having brought it all about, and told her that she could not
desert Lacedaemon and become the ally of Argos, without adding violation
of her oaths to the crime which she had already committed in not accepting
the treaty with Athens, when it had been expressly agreed that the
decision of the majority of the allies should be binding, unless the
gods or heroes stood in the way. Corinth in her answer, delivered
before those of her allies who had like her refused to accept the
treaty, and whom she had previously invited to attend, refrained from
openly stating the injuries she complained of, such as the non-recovery
of Sollium or Anactorium from the Athenians, or any other point in
which she thought she had been prejudiced, but took shelter under
the pretext that she could not give up her Thracian allies, to whom
her separate individual security had been given, when they first rebelled
with Potidaea, as well as upon subsequent occasions. She denied, therefore,
that she committed any violation of her oaths to the allies in not
entering into the treaty with Athens; having sworn upon the faith
of the gods to her Thracian friends, she could not honestly give them
up. Besides, the expression was, "unless the gods or heroes stand
in the way." Now here, as it appeared to her, the gods stood in the
way. This was what she said on the subject of her former oaths. As
to the Argive alliance, she would confer with her friends and do whatever
was right. The Lacedaemonian envoys returning home, some Argive ambassadors
who happened to be in Corinth pressed her to conclude the alliance
without further delay, but were told to attend at the next congress
to be held at Corinth.</p>

<p>Immediately afterwards an Elean embassy arrived, and first making
an alliance with Corinth went on from thence to Argos, according to
their instructions, and became allies of the Argives, their country
being just then at enmity with Lacedaemon and Lepreum. Some time back
there had been a war between the Lepreans and some of the Arcadians;
and the Eleans being called in by the former with the offer of half
their lands, had put an end to the war, and leaving the land in the
hands of its Leprean occupiers had imposed upon them the tribute of
a talent to the Olympian Zeus. Till the Attic war this tribute was
paid by the Lepreans, who then took the war as an excuse for no longer
doing so, and upon the Eleans using force appealed to Lacedaemon.
The case was thus submitted to her arbitrament; but the Eleans, suspecting
the fairness of the tribunal, renounced the reference and laid waste
the Leprean territory. The Lacedaemonians nevertheless decided that
the Lepreans were independent and the Eleans aggressors, and as the
latter did not abide by the arbitration, sent a garrison of heavy
infantry into Lepreum. Upon this the Eleans, holding that Lacedaemon
had received one of their rebel subjects, put forward the convention
providing that each confederate should come out of the Attic war in
possession of what he had when he went into it, and considering that
justice had not been done them went over to the Argives, and now made
the alliance through their ambassadors, who had been instructed for
that purpose. Immediately after them the Corinthians and the Thracian
Chalcidians became allies of Argos. Meanwhile the Boeotians and Megarians,
who acted together, remained quiet, being left to do as they pleased
by Lacedaemon, and thinking that the Argive democracy would not suit
so well with their aristocratic government as the Lacedaemonian constitution.</p>

<p>About the same time in this summer Athens succeeded in reducing Scione,
put the adult males to death, and, making slaves of the women and
children, gave the land for the Plataeans to live in. She also brought
back the Delians to Delos, moved by her misfortunes in the field and
by the commands of the god at Delphi. Meanwhile the Phocians and Locrians
commenced hostilities. The Corinthians and Argives, being now in alliance,
went to Tegea to bring about its defection from Lacedaemon, seeing
that, if so considerable a state could be persuaded to join, all Peloponnese
would be with them. But when the Tegeans said that they would do nothing
against Lacedaemon, the hitherto zealous Corinthians relaxed their
activity, and began to fear that none of the rest would now come over.
Still they went to the Boeotians and tried to persuade them to alliance
and a common action generally with Argos and themselves, and also
begged them to go with them to Athens and obtain for them a ten days'
truce similar to that made between the Athenians and Boeotians not
long after the fifty years' treaty, and, in the event of the Athenians
refusing, to throw up the armistice, and not make any truce in future
without Corinth. These were the requests of the Corinthians. The Boeotians
stopped them on the subject of the Argive alliance, but went with
them to Athens, where however they failed to obtain the ten days'
truce; the Athenian answer being that the Corinthians had truce already,
as being allies of Lacedaemon. Nevertheless the Boeotians did not
throw up their ten days' truce, in spite of the prayers and reproaches
of the Corinthians for their breach of faith; and these last had to
content themselves with a de facto armistice with Athens.</p>

<p>The same summer the Lacedaemonians marched into Arcadia with their
whole levy under Pleistoanax, son of Pausanias, king of Lacedaemon,
against the Parrhasians, who were subjects of Mantinea, and a faction
of whom had invited their aid. They also meant to demolish, if possible,
the fort of Cypsela which the Mantineans had built and garrisoned
in the Parrhasian territory, to annoy the district of Sciritis in
Laconia. The Lacedaemonians accordingly laid waste the Parrhasian
country, and the Mantineans, placing their town in the hands of an
Argive garrison, addressed themselves to the defence of their confederacy,
but being unable to save Cypsela or the Parrhasian towns went back
to Mantinea. Meanwhile the Lacedaemonians made the Parrhasians independent,
razed the fortress, and returned home.</p>

<p>The same summer the soldiers from Thrace who had gone out with Brasidas
came back, having been brought from thence after the treaty by Clearidas;
and the Lacedaemonians decreed that the Helots who had fought with
Brasidas should be free and allowed to live where they liked, and
not long afterwards settled them with the Neodamodes at Lepreum, which
is situated on the Laconian and Elean border; Lacedaemon being at
this time at enmity with Elis. Those however of the Spartans who had
been taken prisoners on the island and had surrendered their arms
might, it was feared, suppose that they were to be subjected to some
degradation in consequence of their misfortune, and so make some attempt
at revolution, if left in possession of their franchise. These were
therefore at once disfranchised, although some of them were in office
at the time, and thus placed under a disability to take office, or
buy and sell anything. After some time, however, the franchise was
restored to them.</p>

<p>The same summer the Dians took Thyssus, a town on Acte by Athos in
alliance with Athens. During the whole of this summer intercourse
between the Athenians and Peloponnesians continued, although each
party began to suspect the other directly after the treaty, because
of the places specified in it not being restored. Lacedaemon, to whose
lot it had fallen to begin by restoring Amphipolis and the other towns,
had not done so. She had equally failed to get the treaty accepted
by her Thracian allies, or by the Boeotians or the Corinthians; although
she was continually promising to unite with Athens in compelling their
compliance, if it were longer refused. She also kept fixing a time
at which those who still refused to come in were to be declared enemies
to both parties, but took care not to bind herself by any written
agreement. Meanwhile the Athenians, seeing none of these professions
performed in fact, began to suspect the honesty of her intentions,
and consequently not only refused to comply with her demands for Pylos,
but also repented having given up the prisoners from the island, and
kept tight hold of the other places, until Lacedaemon's part of the
treaty should be fulfilled. Lacedaemon, on the other hand, said she
had done what she could, having given up the Athenian prisoners of
war in her possession, evacuated Thrace, and performed everything
else in her power. Amphipolis it was out of her ability to restore;
but she would endeavour to bring the Boeotians and Corinthians into
the treaty, to recover Panactum, and send home all the Athenian prisoners
of war in Boeotia. Meanwhile she required that Pylos should be restored,
or at all events that the Messenians and Helots should be withdrawn,
as her troops had been from Thrace, and the place garrisoned, if necessary,
by the Athenians themselves. After a number of different conferences
held during the summer, she succeeded in persuading Athens to withdraw
from Pylos the Messenians and the rest of the Helots and deserters
from Laconia, who were accordingly settled by her at Cranii in Cephallenia.
Thus during this summer there was peace and intercourse between the
two peoples.</p>

<p>Next winter, however, the ephors under whom the treaty had been made
were no longer in office, and some of their successors were directly
opposed to it. Embassies now arrived from the Lacedaemonian confederacy,
and the Athenians, Boeotians, and Corinthians also presented themselves
at Lacedaemon, and after much discussion and no agreement between
them, separated for their several homes; when Cleobulus and Xenares,
the two ephors who were the most anxious to break off the treaty,
took advantage of this opportunity to communicate privately with the
Boeotians and Corinthians, and, advising them to act as much as possible
together, instructed the former first to enter into alliance with
Argos, and then try and bring themselves and the Argives into alliance
with Lacedaemon. The Boeotians would so be least likely to be compelled
to come into the Attic treaty; and the Lacedaemonians would prefer
gaining the friendship and alliance of Argos even at the price of
the hostility of Athens and the rupture of the treaty. The Boeotians
knew that an honourable friendship with Argos had been long the desire
of Lacedaemon; for the Lacedaemonians believed that this would considerably
facilitate the conduct of the war outside Peloponnese. Meanwhile they
begged the Boeotians to place Panactum in her hands in order that
she might, if possible, obtain Pylos in exchange for it, and so be
more in a position to resume hostilities with Athens.</p>

<p>After receiving these instructions for their governments from Xenares
and Cleobulus and their friends at Lacedaemon, the Boeotians and Corinthians
departed. On their way home they were joined by two persons high in
office at Argos, who had waited for them on the road, and who now
sounded them upon the possibility of the Boeotians joining the Corinthians,
Eleans, and Mantineans in becoming the allies of Argos, in the idea
that if this could be effected they would be able, thus united, to
make peace or war as they pleased either against Lacedaemon or any
other power. The Boeotian envoys were were pleased at thus hearing
themselves accidentally asked to do what their friends at Lacedaemon
had told them; and the two Argives perceiving that their proposal
was agreeable, departed with a promise to send ambassadors to the
Boeotians. On their arrival the Boeotians reported to the Boeotarchs
what had been said to them at Lacedaemon and also by the Argives who
had met them, and the Boeotarchs, pleased with the idea, embraced
it with the more eagerness from the lucky coincidence of Argos soliciting
the very thing wanted by their friends at Lacedaemon. Shortly afterwards
ambassadors appeared from Argos with the proposals indicated; and
the Boeotarchs approved of the terms and dismissed the ambassadors
with a promise to send envoys to Argos to negotiate the alliance.</p>

<p>In the meantime it was decided by the Boeotarchs, the Corinthians,
the Megarians, and the envoys from Thrace first to interchange oaths
together to give help to each other whenever it was required and not
to make war or peace except in common; after which the Boeotians and
Megarians, who acted together, should make the alliance with Argos.
But before the oaths were taken the Boeotarchs communicated these
proposals to the four councils of the Boeotians, in whom the supreme
power resides, and advised them to interchange oaths with all such
cities as should be willing to enter into a defensive league with
the Boeotians. But the members of the Boeotian councils refused their
assent to the proposal, being afraid of offending Lacedaemon by entering
into a league with the deserter Corinth; the Boeotarchs not having
acquainted them with what had passed at Lacedaemon and with the advice
given by Cleobulus and Xenares and the Boeotian partisans there, namely,
that they should become allies of Corinth and Argos as a preliminary
to a junction with Lacedaemon; fancying that, even if they should
say nothing about this, the councils would not vote against what had
been decided and advised by the Boeotarchs. This difficulty arising,
the Corinthians and the envoys from Thrace departed without anything
having been concluded; and the Boeotarchs, who had previously intended
after carrying this to try and effect the alliance with Argos, now
omitted to bring the Argive question before the councils, or to send
to Argos the envoys whom they had promised; and a general coldness
and delay ensued in the matter.</p>

<p>In this same winter Mecyberna was assaulted and taken by the Olynthians,
having an Athenian garrison inside it.</p>

<p>All this while negotiations had been going on between the Athenians
and Lacedaemonians about the conquests still retained by each, and
Lacedaemon, hoping that if Athens were to get back Panactum from the
Boeotians she might herself recover Pylos, now sent an embassy to
the Boeotians, and begged them to place Panactum and their Athenian
prisoners in her hands, in order that she might exchange them for
Pylos. This the Boeotians refused to do, unless Lacedaemon made a
separate alliance with them as she had done with Athens. Lacedaemon
knew that this would be a breach of faith to Athens, as it had been
agreed that neither of them should make peace or war without the other;
yet wishing to obtain Panactum which she hoped to exchange for Pylos,
and the party who pressed for the dissolution of the treaty strongly
affecting the Boeotian connection, she at length concluded the alliance
just as winter gave way to spring; and Panactum was instantly razed.
And so the eleventh year of the war ended.</p>

<p>In the first days of the summer following, the Argives, seeing that
the promised ambassadors from Boeotia did not arrive, and that Panactum
was being demolished, and that a separate alliance had been concluded
between the Boeotians and Lacedaemonians, began to be afraid that
Argos might be left alone, and all the confederacy go over to Lacedaemon.
They fancied that the Boeotians had been persuaded by the Lacedaemonians
to raze Panactum and to enter into the treaty with the Athenians,
and that Athens was privy to this arrangement, and even her alliance,
therefore, no longer open to them- a resource which they had always
counted upon, by reason of the dissensions existing, in the event
of the noncontinuance of their treaty with Lacedaemon. In this strait
the Argives, afraid that, as the result of refusing to renew the treaty
with Lacedaemon and of aspiring to the supremacy in Peloponnese, they
would have the Lacedaemonians, Tegeans, Boeotians, and Athenians on
their hands all at once, now hastily sent off Eustrophus and Aeson,
who seemed the persons most likely to be acceptable, as envoys to
Lacedaemon, with the view of making as good a treaty as they could
with the Lacedaemonians, upon such terms as could be got, and being
left in peace.</p>

<p>Having reached Lacedaemon, their ambassadors proceeded to negotiate
the terms of the proposed treaty. What the Argives first demanded
was that they might be allowed to refer to the arbitration of some
state or private person the question of the Cynurian land, a piece
of frontier territory about which they have always been disputing,
and which contains the towns of Thyrea and Anthene, and is occupied
by the Lacedaemonians. The Lacedaemonians at first said that they
could not allow this point to be discussed, but were ready to conclude
upon the old terms. Eventually, however, the Argive ambassadors succeeded
in obtaining from them this concession: For the present there was
to be a truce for fifty years, but it should be competent for either
party, there being neither plague nor war in Lacedaemon or Argos,
to give a formal challenge and decide the question of this territory
by battle, as on a former occasion, when both sides claimed the victory;
pursuit not being allowed beyond the frontier of Argos or Lacedaemon.
The Lacedaemonians at first thought this mere folly; but at last,
anxious at any cost to have the friendship of Argos they agreed to
the terms demanded, and reduced them to writing. However, before any
of this should become binding, the ambassadors were to return to Argos
and communicate with their people and, in the event of their approval,
to come at the feast of the Hyacinthia and take the oaths.</p>

<p>The envoys returned accordingly. In the meantime, while the Argives
were engaged in these negotiations, the Lacedaemonian ambassadors-
Andromedes, Phaedimus, and Antimenidas- who were to receive the prisoners
from the Boeotians and restore them and Panactum to the Athenians,
found that the Boeotians had themselves razed Panactum, upon the plea
that oaths had been anciently exchanged between their people and the
Athenians, after a dispute on the subject to the effect that neither
should inhabit the place, but that they should graze it in common.
As for the Athenian prisoners of war in the hands of the Boeotians,
these were delivered over to Andromedes and his colleagues, and by
them conveyed to Athens and given back. The envoys at the same time
announced the razing of Panactum, which to them seemed as good as
its restitution, as it would no longer lodge an enemy of Athens. This
announcement was received with great indignation by the Athenians,
who thought that the Lacedaemonians had played them false, both in
the matter of the demolition of Panactum, which ought to have been
restored to them standing, and in having, as they now heard, made
a separate alliance with the Boeotians, in spite of their previous
promise to join Athens in compelling the adhesion of those who refused
to accede to the treaty. The Athenians also considered the other points
in which Lacedaemon had failed in her compact, and thinking that they
had been overreached, gave an angry answer to the ambassadors and
sent them away.</p>

<p>The breach between the Lacedaemonians and Athenians having gone thus
far, the party at Athens, also, who wished to cancel the treaty, immediately
put themselves in motion. Foremost amongst these was Alcibiades, son
of Clinias, a man yet young in years for any other Hellenic city,
but distinguished by the splendour of his ancestry. Alcibiades thought
the Argive alliance really preferable, not that personal pique had
not also a great deal to do with his opposition; he being offended
with the Lacedaemonians for having negotiated the treaty through Nicias
and Laches, and having overlooked him on account of his youth, and
also for not having shown him the respect due to the ancient connection
of his family with them as their proxeni, which, renounced by his
grandfather, he had lately himself thought to renew by his attentions
to their prisoners taken in the island. Being thus, as he thought,
slighted on all hands, he had in the first instance spoken against
the treaty, saying that the Lacedaemonians were not to be trusted,
but that they only treated, in order to be enabled by this means to
crush Argos, and afterwards to attack Athens alone; and now, immediately
upon the above occurring, he sent privately to the Argives, telling
them to come as quickly as possible to Athens, accompanied by the
Mantineans and Eleans, with proposals of alliance; as the moment was
propitious and he himself would do all he could to help them.</p>

<p>Upon receiving this message and discovering that the Athenians, far
from being privy to the Boeotian alliance, were involved in a serious
quarrel with the Lacedaemonians, the Argives paid no further attention
to the embassy which they had just sent to Lacedaemon on the subject
of the treaty, and began to incline rather towards the Athenians,
reflecting that, in the event of war, they would thus have on their
side a city that was not only an ancient ally of Argos, but a sister
democracy and very powerful at sea. They accordingly at once sent
ambassadors to Athens to treat for an alliance, accompanied by others
from Elis and Mantinea.</p>

<p>At the same time arrived in haste from Lacedaemon an embassy consisting
of persons reputed well disposed towards the Athenians- Philocharidas,
Leon, and Endius- for fear that the Athenians in their irritation
might conclude alliance with the Argives, and also to ask back Pylos
in exchange for Panactum, and in defence of the alliance with the
Boeotians to plead that it had not been made to hurt the Athenians.
Upon the envoys speaking in the senate upon these points, and stating
that they had come with full powers to settle all others at issue
between them, Alcibiades became afraid that, if they were to repeat
these statements to the popular assembly, they might gain the multitude,
and the Argive alliance might be rejected, and accordingly had recourse
to the following stratagem. He persuaded the Lacedaemonians by a solemn
assurance that if they would say nothing of their full powers in the
assembly, he would give back Pylos to them (himself, the present opponent
of its restitution, engaging to obtain this from the Athenians), and
would settle the other points at issue. His plan was to detach them
from Nicias and to disgrace them before the people, as being without
sincerity in their intentions, or even common consistency in their
language, and so to get the Argives, Eleans, and Mantineans taken
into alliance. This plan proved successful. When the envoys appeared
before the people, and upon the question being put to them, did not
say as they had said in the senate, that they had come with full powers,
the Athenians lost all patience, and carried away by Alcibiades, who
thundered more loudly than ever against the Lacedaemonians, were ready
instantly to introduce the Argives and their companions and to take
them into alliance. An earthquake, however, occurring, before anything
definite had been done, this assembly was adjourned.</p>

<p>In the assembly held the next day, Nicias, in spite of the Lacedaemonians
having been deceived themselves, and having allowed him to be deceived
also in not admitting that they had come with full powers, still maintained
that it was best to be friends with the Lacedaemonians, and, letting
the Argive proposals stand over, to send once more to Lacedaemon and
learn her intentions. The adjournment of the war could only increase
their own prestige and injure that of their rivals; the excellent
state of their affairs making it their interest to preserve this prosperity
as long as possible, while those of Lacedaemon were so desperate that
the sooner she could try her fortune again the better. He succeeded
accordingly in persuading them to send ambassadors, himself being
among the number, to invite the Lacedaemonians, if they were really
sincere, to restore Panactum intact with Amphipolis, and to abandon
their alliance with the Boeotians (unless they consented to accede
to the treaty), agreeably to the stipulation which forbade either
to treat without the other. The ambassadors were also directed to
say that the Athenians, had they wished to play false, might already
have made alliance with the Argives, who were indeed come to Athens
for that very purpose, and went off furnished with instructions as
to any other complaints that the Athenians had to make. Having reached
Lacedaemon, they communicated their instructions, and concluded by
telling the Lacedaemonians that unless they gave up their alliance
with the Boeotians, in the event of their not acceding to the treaty,
the Athenians for their part would ally themselves with the Argives
and their friends. The Lacedaemonians, however, refused to give up
the Boeotian alliance- the party of Xenares the ephor, and such as
shared their view, carrying the day upon this point- but renewed the
oaths at the request of Nicias, who feared to return without having
accomplished anything and to be disgraced; as was indeed his fate,
he being held the author of the treaty with Lacedaemon. When he returned,
and the Athenians heard that nothing had been done at Lacedaemon,
they flew into a passion, and deciding that faith had not been kept
with them, took advantage of the presence of the Argives and their
allies, who had been introduced by Alcibiades, and made a treaty and
alliance with them upon the terms following:</p>

<p>The Athenians, Argives, Mantineans, and Eleans, acting for themselves
and the allies in their respective empires, made a treaty for a hundred
years, to be without fraud or hurt by land and by sea.</p>

<p>1. It shall not be lawful to carry on war, either for the Argives,
Eleans, Mantineans, and their allies, against the Athenians, or the
allies in the Athenian empire: or for the Athenians and their allies
against the Argives, Eleans, Mantineans, or their allies, in any way
or means whatsoever. The Athenians, Argives, Eleans, and Mantineans
shall be allies for a hundred years upon the terms following:</p>

<p>2. If an enemy invade the country of the Athenians, the Argives, Eleans,
and Mantineans shall go to the relief of Athens, according as the
Athenians may require by message, in such way as they most effectually
can, to the best of their power. But if the invader be gone after
plundering the territory, the offending state shall be the enemy of
the Argives, Mantineans, Eleans, and Athenians, and war shall be made
against it by all these cities: and no one of the cities shall be
able to make peace with that state, except all the above cities agree
to do so.</p>

<p>3. Likewise the Athenians shall go to the relief of Argos, Mantinea,
and Elis, if an enemy invade the country of Elis, Mantinea, or Argos,
according as the above cities may require by message, in such way
as they most effectually can, to the best of their power. But if the
invader be gone after plundering the territory, the state offending
shall be the enemy of the Athenians, Argives, Mantineans, and Eleans,
and war shall be made against it by all these cities, and peace may
not be made with that state except all the above cities agree to it.</p>

<p>4. No armed force shall be allowed to pass for hostile purposes through
the country of the powers contracting, or of the allies in their respective
empires, or to go by sea, except all the cities- that is to say, Athens,
Argos, Mantinea, and Elis- vote for such passage.</p>

<p>5. The relieving troops shall be maintained by the city sending them
for thirty days from their arrival in the city that has required them,
and upon their return in the same way: if their services be desired
for a longer period, the city that sent for them shall maintain them,
at the rate of three Aeginetan obols per day for a heavy-armed soldier,
archer, or light soldier, and an Aeginetan drachma for a trooper.</p>

<p>6. The city sending for the troops shall have the command when the
war is in its own country: but in case of the cities resolving upon
a joint expedition the command shall be equally divided among all
the cities.</p>

<p>7. The treaty shall be sworn to by the Athenians for themselves and
their allies, by the Argives, Mantineans, Eleans, and their allies,
by each state individually. Each shall swear the oath most binding
in his country over full-grown victims: the oath being as follows:</p>

<p>"I STAND BY THE ALLIANCE AND ITS ARTICLES, JUSTLY, INNOCENTLY, AND
Sincerely, AND I WILL NOT TRANSGRESS THE SAME IN ANY WAY OR MEANS
Whatsoever." The oath shall taken at Athens by the Senate and the
magistrates, the Prytanes administering it: as by the Senate, the
Eighty, and the Artynae, the Eighty administering it: at Mantinea
by the Demiurgi, the Senate, and the other magistrates, the Theori
and Polemarchs administering it: at Elis by the Demiurgi, the magistrates,
and the Six Hundred, the Demiurgi and the Thesmophylaces administering
it. The oaths shall be renewed by the Athenians going to Elis, Mantinea,
and Argos thirty days before the Olympic games: by the Argives, Mantineans,
and Eleans going to Athens ten days before the great feast of the
Panathenaea. The articles of the treaty, the oaths, and the alliance
shall be inscribed on a stone pillar by the Athenians in the citadel,
by the Argives in the market-place, in the temple of Apollo: by the
Mantineans in the temple of Zeus, in the market-place: and a brazen
pillar shall be erected jointly by them at the Olympic games now at
hand. Should the above cities see good to make any addition in these
articies, whatever all the above cities shall agree upon, after consulting
together, shall be binding.</p>

<p>Although the treaty and alliances were thus concluded, still the treaty
between the Lacedaemonians and Athenians was not renounced by either
party. Meanwhile Corinth, although the ally of the Argives, did not
accede to the new treaty, any more than she had done to the alliance,
defensive and offensive, formed before this between the Eleans, Argives,
and Mantineans, when she declared herself content with the first alliance,
which was defensive only, and which bound them to help each other,
but not to join in attacking any. The Corinthians thus stood aloof
from their allies, and again turned their thoughts towards Lacedaemon.</p>

<p>At the Olympic games which were held this summer, and in which the
Arcadian Androsthenes was victor the first time in the wrestling and
boxing, the Lacedaemonians were excluded from the temple by the Eleans,
and thus prevented from sacrificing or contending, for having refused
to pay the fine specified in the Olympic law imposed upon them by
the Eleans, who alleged that they had attacked Fort Phyrcus, and sent
heavy infantry of theirs into Lepreum during the Olympic truce. The
amount of the fine was two thousand minae, two for each heavy-armed
soldier, as the law prescribes. The Lacedaemonians sent envoys, and
pleaded that the imposition was unjust; saying that the truce had
not yet been proclaimed at Lacedaemon when the heavy infantry were
sent off. But the Eleans affirmed that the armistice with them had
already begun (they proclaim it first among themselves), and that
the aggression of the Lacedaemonians had taken them by surprise while
they were living quietly as in time of peace, and not expecting anything.
Upon this the Lacedaemonians submitted, that if the Eleans really
believed that they had committed an aggression, it was useless after
that to proclaim the truce at Lacedaemon; but they had proclaimed
it notwithstanding, as believing nothing of the kind, and from that
moment the Lacedaemonians had made no attack upon their country. Nevertheless
the Eleans adhered to what they had said, that nothing would persuade
them that an aggression had not been committed; if, however, the Lacedaemonians
would restore Lepreum, they would give up their own share of the money
and pay that of the god for them.</p>

<p>As this proposal was not accepted, the Eleans tried a second. Instead
of restoring Lepreum, if this was objected to, the Lacedaemonians
should ascend the altar of the Olympian Zeus, as they were so anxious
to have access to the temple, and swear before the Hellenes that they
would surely pay the fine at a later day. This being also refused,
the Lacedaemonians were excluded from the temple, the sacrifice, and
the games, and sacrificed at home; the Lepreans being the only other
Hellenes who did not attend. Still the Eleans were afraid of the Lacedaemonians
sacrificing by force, and kept guard with a heavy-armed company of
their young men; being also joined by a thousand Argives, the same
number of Mantineans, and by some Athenian cavalry who stayed at Harpina
during the feast. Great fears were felt in the assembly of the Lacedaemonians
coming in arms, especially after Lichas, son of Arcesilaus, a Lacedaemonian,
had been scourged on the course by the umpires; because, upon his
horses being the winners, and the Boeotian people being proclaimed
the victor on account of his having no right to enter, he came forward
on the course and crowned the charioteer, in order to show that the
chariot was his. After this incident all were more afraid than ever,
and firmly looked for a disturbance: the Lacedaemonians, however,
kept quiet, and let the feast pass by, as we have seen. After the
Olympic games, the Argives and the allies repaired to Corinth to invite
her to come over to them. There they found some Lacedaemonian envoys;
and a long discussion ensued, which after all ended in nothing, as
an earthquake occurred, and they dispersed to their different homes.</p>

<p>Summer was now over. The winter following a battle took place between
the Heracleots in Trachinia and the Aenianians, Dolopians, Malians,
and certain of the Thessalians, all tribes bordering on and hostile
to the town, which directly menaced their country. Accordingly, after
having opposed and harassed it from its very foundation by every means
in their power, they now in this battle defeated the Heracleots, Xenares,
son of Cnidis, their Lacedaemonian commander, being among the slain.
Thus the winter ended and the twelfth year of this war ended also.
After the battle, Heraclea was so terribly reduced that in the first
days of the summer following the Boeotians occupied the place and
sent away the Lacedaemonian Agesippidas for misgovernment, fearing
that the town might be taken by the Athenians while the Lacedaemonians
were distracted with the affairs of Peloponnese. The Lacedaemonians,
nevertheless, were offended with them for what they had done.</p>

<p>The same summer Alcibiades, son of Clinias, now one of the generals
at Athens, in concert with the Argives and the allies, went into Peloponnese
with a few Athenian heavy infantry and archers and some of the allies
in those parts whom he took up as he passed, and with this army marched
here and there through Peloponnese, and settled various matters connected
with the alliance, and among other things induced the Patrians to
carry their walls down to the sea, intending himself also to build
a fort near the Achaean Rhium. However, the Corinthians and Sicyonians,
and all others who would have suffered by its being built, came up
and hindered him.</p>

<p>The same summer war broke out between the Epidaurians and Argives.
The pretext was that the Epidaurians did not send an offering for
their pasture-land to Apollo Pythaeus, as they were bound to do, the
Argives having the chief management of the temple; but, apart from
this pretext, Alcibiades and the Argives were determined, if possible,
to gain possession of Epidaurus, and thus to ensure the neutrality
of Corinth and give the Athenians a shorter passage for their reinforcements
from Aegina than if they had to sail round Scyllaeum. The Argives
accordingly prepared to invade Epidaurus by themselves, to exact the
offering.</p>

<p>About the same time the Lacedaemonians marched out with all their
people to Leuctra upon their frontier, opposite to Mount Lycaeum,
under the command of Agis, son of Archidamus, without any one knowing
their destination, not even the cities that sent the contingents.
The sacrifices, however, for crossing the frontier not proving propitious,
the Lacedaemonians returned home themselves, and sent word to the
allies to be ready to march after the month ensuing, which happened
to be the month of Carneus, a holy time for the Dorians. Upon the
retreat of the Lacedaemonians the Argives marched out on the last
day but three of the month before Carneus, and keeping this as the
day during the whole time that they were out, invaded and plundered
Epidaurus. The Epidaurians summoned their allies to their aid, some
of whom pleaded the month as an excuse; others came as far as the
frontier of Epidaurus and there remained inactive.</p>

<p>While the Argives were in Epidaurus embassies from the cities assembled
at Mantinea, upon the invitation of the Athenians. The conference
having begun, the Corinthian Euphamidas said that their actions did
not agree with their words; while they were sitting deliberating about
peace, the Epidaurians and their allies and the Argives were arrayed
against each other in arms; deputies from each party should first
go and separate the armies, and then the talk about peace might be
resumed. In compliance with this suggestion, they went and brought
back the Argives from Epidaurus, and afterwards reassembled, but without
succeeding any better in coming to a conclusion; and the Argives a
second time invaded Epidaurus and plundered the country. The Lacedaemonians
also marched out to Caryae; but the frontier sacrifices again proving
unfavourable, they went back again, and the Argives, after ravaging
about a third of the Epidaurian territory, returned home. Meanwhile
a thousand Athenian heavy infantry had come to their aid under the
command of Alcibiades, but finding that the Lacedaemonian expedition
was at an end, and that they were no longer wanted, went back again.</p>

<p>So passed the summer. The next winter the Lacedaemonians managed to
elude the vigilance of the Athenians, and sent in a garrison of three
hundred men to Epidaurus, under the command of Agesippidas. Upon this
the Argives went to the Athenians and complained of their having allowed
an enemy to pass by sea, in spite of the clause in the treaty by which
the allies were not to allow an enemy to pass through their country.
Unless, therefore, they now put the Messenians and Helots in Pylos
to annoy the Lacedaemonians, they, the Argives, should consider that
faith had not been kept with them. The Athenians were persuaded by
Alcibiades to inscribe at the bottom of the Laconian pillar that the
Lacedaemonians had not kept their oaths, and to convey the Helots
at Cranii to Pylos to plunder the country; but for the rest they remained
quiet as before. During this winter hostilities went on between the
Argives and Epidaurians, without any pitched battle taking place,
but only forays and ambuscades, in which the losses were small and
fell now on one side and now on the other. At the close of the winter,
towards the beginning of spring, the Argives went with scaling ladders
to Epidaurus, expecting to find it left unguarded on account of the
war and to be able to take it by assault, but returned unsuccessful.
And the winter ended, and with it the thirteenth year of the war ended
also.</p>

<p>In the middle of the next summer the Lacedaemonians, seeing the Epidaurians,
their allies, in distress, and the rest of Peloponnese either in revolt
or disaffected, concluded that it was high time for them to interfere
if they wished to stop the progress of the evil, and accordingly with
their full force, the Helots included, took the field against Argos,
under the command of Agis, son of Archidamus, king of the Lacedaemonians.
The Tegeans and the other Arcadian allies of Lacedaemon joined in
the expedition. The allies from the rest of Peloponnese and from outside
mustered at Phlius; the Boeotians with five thousand heavy infantry
and as many light troops, and five hundred horse and the same number
of dismounted troopers; the Corinthians with two thousand heavy infantry;
the rest more or less as might happen; and the Phliasians with all
their forces, the army being in their country.</p>

<p>The preparations of the Lacedaemonians from the first had been known
to the Argives, who did not, however, take the field until the enemy
was on his road to join the rest at Phlius. Reinforced by the Mantineans
with their allies, and by three thousand Elean heavy infantry, they
advanced and fell in with the Lacedaemonians at Methydrium in Arcadia.
Each party took up its position upon a hill, and the Argives prepared
to engage the Lacedaemonians while they were alone; but Agis eluded
them by breaking up his camp in the night, and proceeded to join the
rest of the allies at Phlius. The Argives discovering this at daybreak,
marched first to Argos and then to the Nemean road, by which they
expected the Lacedaemonians and their allies would come down. However,
Agis, instead of taking this road as they expected, gave the Lacedaemonians,
Arcadians, and Epidaurians their orders, and went along another difficult
road, and descended into the plain of Argos. The Corinthians, Pellenians,
and Phliasians marched by another steep road; while the Boeotians,
Megarians, and Sicyonians had instructions to come down by the Nemean
road where the Argives were posted, in order that, if the enemy advanced
into the plain against the troops of Agis, they might fall upon his
rear with their cavalry. These dispositions concluded, Agis invaded
the plain and began to ravage Saminthus and other places.</p>

<p>Discovering this, the Argives came up from Nemea, day having now dawned.
On their way they fell in with the troops of the Phliasians and Corinthians,
and killed a few of the Phliasians and had perhaps a few more of their
own men killed by the Corinthians. Meanwhile the Boeotians, Megarians,
and Sicyonians, advancing upon Nemea according to their instructions,
found the Argives no longer there, as they had gone down on seeing
their property ravaged, and were now forming for battle, the Lacedaemonians
imitating their example. The Argives were now completely surrounded;
from the plain the Lacedaemonians and their allies shut them off from
their city; above them were the Corinthians, Phliasians, and Pellenians;
and on the side of Nemea the Boeotians, Sicyonians, and Megarians.
Meanwhile their army was without cavalry, the Athenians alone among
the allies not having yet arrived. Now the bulk of the Argives and
their allies did not see the danger of their position, but thought
that they could not have a fairer field, having intercepted the Lacedaemonians
in their own country and close to the city. Two men, however, in the
Argive army, Thrasylus, one of the five generals, and Alciphron, the
Lacedaemonian proxenus, just as the armies were upon the point of
engaging, went and held a parley with Agis and urged him not to bring
on a battle, as the Argives were ready to refer to fair and equal
arbitration whatever complaints the Lacedaemonians might have against
them, and to make a treaty and live in peace in future.</p>

<p>The Argives who made these statements did so upon their own authority,
not by order of the people, and Agis on his accepted their proposals,
and without himself either consulting the majority, simply communicated
the matter to a single individual, one of the high officers accompanying
the expedition, and granted the Argives a truce for four months, in
which to fulfil their promises; after which he immediately led off
the army without giving any explanation to any of the other allies.
The Lacedaemonians and allies followed their general out of respect
for the law, but amongst themselves loudly blamed Agis for going away
from so fair a field (the enemy being hemmed in on every side by infantry
and cavalry) without having done anything worthy of their strength.
Indeed this was by far the finest Hellenic army ever yet brought together;
and it should have been seen while it was still united at Nemea, with
the Lacedaemonians in full force, the Arcadians, Boeotians, Corinthians,
Sicyonians, Pellenians, Phliasians and Megarians, and all these the
flower of their respective populations, thinking themselves a match
not merely for the Argive confederacy, but for another such added
to it. The army thus retired blaming Agis, and returned every man
to his home. The Argives however blamed still more loudly the persons
who had concluded the truce without consulting the people, themselves
thinking that they had let escape with the Lacedaemonians an opportunity
such as they should never see again; as the struggle would have been
under the walls of their city, and by the side of many and brave allies.
On their return accordingly they began to stone Thrasylus in the bed
of the Charadrus, where they try all military causes before entering
the city. Thrasylus fled to the altar, and so saved his life; his
property however they confiscated.</p>

<p>After this arrived a thousand Athenian heavy infantry and three hundred
horse, under the command of Laches and Nicostratus; whom the Argives,
being nevertheless loath to break the truce with the Lacedaemonians,
begged to depart, and refused to bring before the people, to whom
they had a communication to make, until compelled to do so by the
entreaties of the Mantineans and Eleans, who were still at Argos.
The Athenians, by the mouth of Alcibiades their ambassador there present,
told the Argives and the allies that they had no right to make a truce
at all without the consent of their fellow confederates, and now that
the Athenians had arrived so opportunely the war ought to be resumed.
These arguments proving successful with the allies, they immediately
marched upon Orchomenos, all except the Argives, who, although they
had consented like the rest, stayed behind at first, but eventually
joined the others. They now all sat down and besieged Orchomenos,
and made assaults upon it; one of their reasons for desiring to gain
this place being that hostages from Arcadia had been lodged there
by the Lacedaemonians. The Orchomenians, alarmed at the weakness of
their wall and the numbers of the enemy, and at the risk they ran
of perishing before relief arrived, capitulated upon condition of
joining the league, of giving hostages of their own to the Mantineans,
and giving up those lodged with them by the Lacedaemonians. Orchomenos
thus secured, the allies now consulted as to which of the remaining
places they should attack next. The Eleans were urgent for Lepreum;
the Mantineans for Tegea; and the Argives and Athenians giving their
support to the Mantineans, the Eleans went home in a rage at their
not having voted for Lepreum; while the rest of the allies made ready
at Mantinea for going against Tegea, which a party inside had arranged
to put into their hands.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Lacedaemonians, upon their return from Argos after concluding
the four months' truce, vehemently blamed Agis for not having subdued
Argos, after an opportunity such as they thought they had never had
before; for it was no easy matter to bring so many and so good allies
together. But when the news arrived of the capture of Orchomenos,
they became more angry than ever, and, departing from all precedent,
in the heat of the moment had almost decided to raze his house, and
to fine him ten thousand drachmae. Agis however entreated them to
do none of these things, promising to atone for his fault by good
service in the field, failing which they might then do to him whatever
they pleased; and they accordingly abstained from razing his house
or fining him as they had threatened to do, and now made a law, hitherto
unknown at Lacedaemon, attaching to him ten Spartans as counsellors,
without whose consent he should have no power to lead an army out
of the city.</p>

<p>At this juncture arrived word from their friends in Tegea that, unless
they speedily appeared, Tegea would go over from them to the Argives
and their allies, if it had not gone over already. Upon this news
a force marched out from Lacedaemon, of the Spartans and Helots and
all their people, and that instantly and upon a scale never before
witnessed. Advancing to Orestheum in Maenalia, they directed the Arcadians
in their league to follow close after them to Tegea, and, going on
themselves as far as Orestheum, from thence sent back the sixth part
of the Spartans, consisting of the oldest and youngest men, to guard
their homes, and with the rest of their army arrived at Tegea; where
their Arcadian allies soon after joined them. Meanwhile they sent
to Corinth, to the Boeotians, the Phocians, and Locrians, with orders
to come up as quickly as possible to Mantinea. These had but short
notice; and it was not easy except all together, and after waiting
for each other, to pass through the enemy's country, which lay right
across and blocked up the line of communication. Nevertheless they
made what haste they could. Meanwhile the Lacedaemonians with the
Arcadian allies that had joined them, entered the territory of Mantinea,
and encamping near the temple of Heracles began to plunder the country.</p>

<p>Here they were seen by the Argives and their allies, who immediately
took up a strong and difficult position, and formed in order of battle.
The Lacedaemonians at once advanced against them, and came on within
a stone's throw or javelin's cast, when one of the older men, seeing
the enemy's position to be a strong one, hallooed to Agis that he
was minded to cure one evil with another; meaning that he wished to
make amends for his retreat, which had been so much blamed, from Argos,
by his present untimely precipitation. Meanwhile Agis, whether in
consequence of this halloo or of some sudden new idea of his own,
quickly led back his army without engaging, and entering the Tegean
territory, began to turn off into that of Mantinea the water about
which the Mantineans and Tegeans are always fighting, on account of
the extensive damage it does to whichever of the two countries it
falls into. His object in this was to make the Argives and their allies
come down from the hill, to resist the diversion of the water, as
they would be sure to do when they knew of it, and thus to fight the
battle in the plain. He accordingly stayed that day where he was,
engaged in turning off the water. The Argives and their allies were
at first amazed at the sudden retreat of the enemy after advancing
so near, and did not know what to make of it; but when he had gone
away and disappeared, without their having stirred to pursue him,
they began anew to find fault with their generals, who had not only
let the Lacedaemonians get off before, when they were so happily intercepted
before Argos, but who now again allowed them to run away, without
any one pursuing them, and to escape at their leisure while the Argive
army was leisurely betrayed.</p>

<p>The generals, half-stunned for the moment, afterwards led them down
from the hill, and went forward and encamped in the plain, with the
intention of attacking the enemy.</p>

<p>The next day the Argives and their allies formed in the order in which
they meant to fight, if they chanced to encounter the enemy; and the
Lacedaemonians returning from the water to their old encampment by
the temple of Heracles, suddenly saw their adversaries close in front
of them, all in complete order, and advanced from the hill. A shock
like that of the present moment the Lacedaemonians do not ever remember
to have experienced: there was scant time for preparation, as they
instantly and hastily fell into their ranks, Agis, their king, directing
everything, agreeably to the law. For when a king is in the field
all commands proceed from him: he gives the word to the Polemarchs;
they to the Lochages; these to the Pentecostyes; these again to the
Enomotarchs, and these last to the Enomoties. In short all orders
required pass in the same way and quickly reach the troops; as almost
the whole Lacedaemonian army, save for a small part, consists of officers
under officers, and the care of what is to be done falls upon many.</p>

<p>In this battle the left wing was composed of the Sciritae, who in
a Lacedaemonian army have always that post to themselves alone; next
to these were the soldiers of Brasidas from Thrace, and the Neodamodes
with them; then came the Lacedaemonians themselves, company after
company, with the Arcadians of Heraea at their side. After these were
the Maenalians, and on the right wing the Tegeans with a few of the
Lacedaemonians at the extremity; their cavalry being posted upon the
two wings. Such was the Lacedaemonian formation. That of their opponents
was as follows: On the right were the Mantineans, the action taking
place in their country; next to them the allies from Arcadia; after
whom came the thousand picked men of the Argives, to whom the state
had given a long course of military training at the public expense;
next to them the rest of the Argives, and after them their allies,
the Cleonaeans and Orneans, and lastly the Athenians on the extreme
left, and lastly the Athenians on the extreme left, and their own
cavalry with them.</p>

<p>Such were the order and the forces of the two combatants. The Lacedaemonian
army looked the largest; though as to putting down the numbers of
either host, or of the contingents composing it, I could not do so
with any accuracy. Owing to the secrecy of their government the number
of the Lacedaemonians was not known, and men are so apt to brag about
the forces of their country that the estimate of their opponents was
not trusted. The following calculation, however, makes it possible
to estimate the numbers of the Lacedaemonians present upon this occasion.
There were seven companies in the field without counting the Sciritae,
who numbered six hundred men: in each company there were four Pentecostyes,
and in the Pentecosty four Enomoties. The first rank of the Enomoty
was composed of four soldiers: as to the depth, although they had
not been all drawn up alike, but as each captain chose, they were
generally ranged eight deep; the first rank along the whole line,
exclusive of the Sciritae, consisted of four hundred and forty-eight
men.</p>

<p>The armies being now on the eve of engaging, each contingent received
some words of encouragement from its own commander. The Mantineans
were, reminded that they were going to fight for their country and
to avoid returning to the experience of servitude after having tasted
that of empire; the Argives, that they would contend for their ancient
supremacy, to regain their once equal share of Peloponnese of which
they had been so long deprived, and to punish an enemy and a neighbour
for a thousand wrongs; the Athenians, of the glory of gaining the
honours of the day with so many and brave allies in arms, and that
a victory over the Lacedaemonians in Peloponnese would cement and
extend their empire, and would besides preserve Attica from all invasions
in future. These were the incitements addressed to the Argives and
their allies. The Lacedaemonians meanwhile, man to man, and with their
war-songs in the ranks, exhorted each brave comrade to remember what
he had learnt before; well aware that the long training of action
was of more saving virtue than any brief verbal exhortation, though
never so well delivered.</p>

<p>After this they joined battle, the Argives and their allies advancing
with haste and fury, the Lacedaemonians slowly and to the music of
many flute-players- a standing institution in their army, that has
nothing to do with religion, but is meant to make them advance evenly,
stepping in time, without break their order, as large armies are apt
to do in the moment of engaging.</p>

<p>Just before the battle joined, King Agis resolved upon the following
manoeuvre. All armies are alike in this: on going into action they
get forced out rather on their right wing, and one and the other overlap
with this adversary's left; because fear makes each man do his best
to shelter his unarmed side with the shield of the man next him on
the right, thinking that the closer the shields are locked together
the better will he be protected. The man primarily responsible for
this is the first upon the right wing, who is always striving to withdraw
from the enemy his unarmed side; and the same apprehension makes the
rest follow him. On the present occasion the Mantineans reached with
their wing far beyond the Sciritae, and the Lacedaemonians and Tegeans
still farther beyond the Athenians, as their army was the largest.
Agis, afraid of his left being surrounded, and thinking that the Mantineans
outflanked it too far, ordered the Sciritae and Brasideans to move
out from their place in the ranks and make the line even with the
Mantineans, and told the Polemarchs Hipponoidas and Aristocles to
fill up the gap thus formed, by throwing themselves into it with two
companies taken from the right wing; thinking that his right would
still be strong enough and to spare, and that the line fronting the
Mantineans would gain in solidity.</p>

<p>However, as he gave these orders in the moment of the onset, and at
short notice, it so happened that Aristocles and Hipponoidas would
not move over, for which offence they were afterwards banished from
Sparta, as having been guilty of cowardice; and the enemy meanwhile
closed before the Sciritae (whom Agis on seeing that the two companies
did not move over ordered to return to their place) had time to fill
up the breach in question. Now it was, however, that the Lacedaemonians,
utterly worsted in respect of skill, showed themselves as superior
in point of courage. As soon as they came to close quarters with the
enemy, the Mantinean right broke their Sciritae and Brasideans, and,
bursting in with their allies and the thousand picked Argives into
the unclosed breach in their line, cut up and surrounded the Lacedaemonians,
and drove them in full rout to the wagons, slaying some of the older
men on guard there. But the Lacedaemonians, worsted in this part of
the field, with the rest of their army, and especially the centre,
where the three hundred knights, as they are called, fought round
King Agis, fell on the older men of the Argives and the five companies
so named, and on the Cleonaeans, the Orneans, and the Athenians next
them, and instantly routed them; the greater number not even waiting
to strike a blow, but giving way the moment that they came on, some
even being trodden under foot, in their fear of being overtaken by
their assailants.</p>

<p>The army of the Argives and their allies, having given way in this
quarter, was now completely cut in two, and the Lacedaemonian and
Tegean right simultaneously closing round the Athenians with the troops
that outflanked them, these last found themselves placed between two
fires, being surrounded on one side and already defeated on the other.
Indeed they would have suffered more severely than any other part
of the army, but for the services of the cavalry which they had with
them. Agis also on perceiving the distress of his left opposed to
the Mantineans and the thousand Argives, ordered all the army to advance
to the support of the defeated wing; and while this took place, as
the enemy moved past and slanted away from them, the Athenians escaped
at their leisure, and with them the beaten Argive division. Meanwhile
the Mantineans and their allies and the picked body of the Argives
ceased to press the enemy, and seeing their friends defeated and the
Lacedaemonians in full advance upon them, took to flight. Many of
the Mantineans perished; but the bulk of the picked body of the Argives
made good their escape. The flight and retreat, however, were neither
hurried nor long; the Lacedaemonians fighting long and stubbornly
until the rout of their enemy, but that once effected, pursuing for
a short time and not far.</p>

<p>Such was the battle, as nearly as possible as I have described it;
the greatest that had occurred for a very long while among the Hellenes,
and joined by the most considerable states. The Lacedaemonians took
up a position in front of the enemy's dead, and immediately set up
a trophy and stripped the slain; they took up their own dead and carried
them back to Tegea, where they buried them, and restored those of
the enemy under truce. The Argives, Orneans, and Cleonaeans had seven
hundred killed; the Mantineans two hundred, and the Athenians and
Aeginetans also two hundred, with both their generals. On the side
of the Lacedaemonians, the allies did not suffer any loss worth speaking
of: as to the Lacedaemonians themselves it was difficult to learn
the truth; it is said, however, that there were slain about three
hundred of them.</p>

<p>While the battle was impending, Pleistoanax, the other king, set out
with a reinforcement composed of the oldest and youngest men, and
got as far as Tegea, where he heard of the victory and went back again.
The Lacedaemonians also sent and turned back the allies from Corinth
and from beyond the Isthmus, and returning themselves dismissed their
allies, and kept the Carnean holidays, which happened to be at that
time. The imputations cast upon them by the Hellenes at the time,
whether of cowardice on account of the disaster in the island, or
of mismanagement and slowness generally, were all wiped out by this
single action: fortune, it was thought, might have humbled them, but
the men themselves were the same as ever.</p>

<p>The day before this battle, the Epidaurians with all their forces
invaded the deserted Argive territory, and cut off many of the guards
left there in the absence of the Argive army. After the battle three
thousand Elean heavy infantry arriving to aid the Mantineans, and
a reinforcement of one thousand Athenians, all these allies marched
at once against Epidaurus, while the Lacedaemonians were keeping the
Carnea, and dividing the work among them began to build a wall round
the city. The rest left off; but the Athenians finished at once the
part assigned to them round Cape Heraeum; and having all joined in
leaving a garrison in the fortification in question, they returned
to their respective cities.</p>

<p>Summer now came to an end. In the first days of the next winter, when
the Carnean holidays were over, the Lacedaemonians took the field,
and arriving at Tegea sent on to Argos proposals of accommodation.
They had before had a party in the town desirous of overthrowing the
democracy; and after the battle that had been fought, these were now
far more in a position to persuade the people to listen to terms.
Their plan was first to make a treaty with the Lacedaemonians, to
be followed by an alliance, and after this to fall upon the commons.
Lichas, son of Arcesilaus, the Argive proxenus, accordingly arrived
at Argos with two proposals from Lacedaemon, to regulate the conditions
of war or peace, according as they preferred the one or the other.
After much discussion, Alcibiades happening to be in the town, the
Lacedaemonian party, who now ventured to act openly, persuaded the
Argives to accept the proposal for accommodation; which ran as follows:</p>

<p>The assembly of the Lacedaemonians agrees to treat with the Argives
upon the terms following:</p>

<p>1. The Argives shall restore to the Orchomenians their children, and
to the Maenalians their men, and shall restore the men they have in
Mantinea to the Lacedaemonians.</p>

<p>2. They shall evacuate Epidaurus, and raze the fortification there.
If the Athenians refuse to withdraw from Epidaurus, they shall be
declared enemies of the Argives and of the Lacedaemonians, and of
the allies of the Lacedaemonians and the allies of the Argives.</p>

<p>3. If the Lacedaemonians have any children in their custody, they
shall restore them every one to his city.</p>

<p>4. As to the offering to the god, the Argives, if they wish, shall
impose an oath upon the Epidaurians, but, if not, they shall swear
it themselves.</p>

<p>5. All the cities in Peloponnese, both small and great, shall be independent
according to the customs of their country.</p>

<p>6. If any of the powers outside Peloponnese invade Peloponnesian territory,
the parties contracting shall unite to repel them, on such terms as
they may agree upon, as being most fair for the Peloponnesians.</p>

<p>7. All allies of the Lacedaemonians outside Peloponnese shall be on
the same footing as the Lacedaemonians, and the allies of the Argives
shall be on the same footing as the Argives, being left in enjoyment
of their own possessions.</p>

<p>8. This treaty shall be shown to the allies, and shall be concluded,
if they approve; if the allies think fit, they may send the treaty
to be considered at home.</p>

<p>The Argives began by accepting this proposal, and the Lacedaemonian
army returned home from Tegea. After this intercourse was renewed
between them, and not long afterwards the same party contrived that
the Argives should give up the league with the Mantineans, Eleans,
and Athenians, and should make a treaty and alliance with the Lacedaemonians;
which was consequently done upon the terms following:</p>

<p>The Lacedaemonians and Argives agree to a treaty and alliance for
fifty years upon the terms following:</p>

<p>1. All disputes shall be decided by fair and impartial arbitration,
agreeably to the customs of the two countries.</p>

<p>2. The rest of the cities in Peloponnese may be included in this treaty
and alliance, as independent and sovereign, in full enjoyment of what
they possess, all disputes being decided by fair and impartial arbitration,
agreeably to the customs of the said cities.</p>

<p>3. All allies of the Lacedaemonians outside Peloponnese shall be upon
the same footing as the Lacedaemonians themselves, and the allies
of the Argives shall be upon the same footing as the Argives themselves,
continuing to enjoy what they possess.</p>

<p>4. If it shall be anywhere necessary to make an expedition in common,
the Lacedaemonians and Argives shall consult upon it and decide, as
may be most fair for the allies.</p>

<p>5. If any of the cities, whether inside or outside Peloponnese, have
a question whether of frontiers or otherwise, it must be settled,
but if one allied city should have a quarrel with another allied city,
it must be referred to some third city thought impartial by both parties.
Private citizens shall have their disputes decided according to the
laws of their several countries.</p>

<p>The treaty and above alliance concluded, each party at once released
everything whether acquired by war or otherwise, and thenceforth acting
in common voted to receive neither herald nor embassy from the Athenians
unless they evacuated their forts and withdrew from Peloponnese, and
also to make neither peace nor war with any, except jointly. Zeal
was not wanting: both parties sent envoys to the Thracian places and
to Perdiccas, and persuaded the latter to join their league. Still
he did not at once break off from Athens, although minded to do so
upon seeing the way shown him by Argos, the original home of his family.
They also renewed their old oaths with the Chalcidians and took new
ones: the Argives, besides, sent ambassadors to the Athenians, bidding
them evacuate the fort at Epidaurus. The Athenians, seeing their own
men outnumbered by the rest of the garrison, sent Demosthenes to bring
them out. This general, under colour of a gymnastic contest which
he arranged on his arrival, got the rest of the garrison out of the
place, and shut the gates behind them. Afterwards the Athenians renewed
their treaty with the Epidaurians, and by themselves gave up the fortress.</p>

<p>After the defection of Argos from the league, the Mantineans, though
they held out at first, in the end finding themselves powerless without
the Argives, themselves too came to terms with Lacedaemon, and gave
up their sovereignty over the towns. The Lacedaemonians and Argives,
each a thousand strong, now took the field together, and the former
first went by themselves to Sicyon and made the government there more
oligarchical than before, and then both, uniting, put down the democracy
at Argos and set up an oligarchy favourable to Lacedaemon. These events
occurred at the close of the winter, just before spring; and the fourteenth
year of the war ended. The next summer the people of Dium, in Athos,
revolted from the Athenians to the Chalcidians, and the Lacedaemonians
settled affairs in Achaea in a way more agreeable to the interests
of their country. Meanwhile the popular party at Argos little by little
gathered new consistency and courage, and waited for the moment of
the Gymnopaedic festival at Lacedaemon, and then fell upon the oligarchs.
After a fight in the city, victory declared for the commons, who slew
some of their opponents and banished others. The Lacedaemonians for
a long while let the messages of their friends at Argos remain without
effect. At last they put off the Gymnopaediae and marched to their
succour, but learning at Tegea the defeat of the oligarchs, refused
to go any further in spite of the entreaties of those who had escaped,
and returned home and kept the festival. Later on, envoys arrived
with messages from the Argives in the town and from the exiles, when
the allies were also at Sparta; and after much had been said on both
sides, the Lacedaemonians decided that the party in the town had done
wrong, and resolved to march against Argos, but kept delaying and
putting off the matter. Meanwhile the commons at Argos, in fear of
the Lacedaemonians, began again to court the Athenian alliance, which
they were convinced would be of the greatest service to them; and
accordingly proceeded to build long walls to the sea, in order that
in case of a blockade by land; with the help of the Athenians they
might have the advantage of importing what they wanted by sea. Some
of the cities in Peloponnese were also privy to the building of these
walls; and the Argives with all their people, women and slaves not
excepted, addressed themselves to the work, while carpenters and masons
came to them from Athens.</p>

<p>Summer was now over. The winter following the Lacedaemonians, hearing
of the walls that were building, marched against Argos with their
allies, the Corinthians excepted, being also not without intelligence
in the city itself; Agis, son of Archidamus, their king, was in command.
The intelligence which they counted upon within the town came to nothing;
they however took and razed the walls which were being built, and
after capturing the Argive town Hysiae and killing all the freemen
that fell into their hands, went back and dispersed every man to his
city. After this the Argives marched into Phlius and plundered it
for harbouring their exiles, most of whom had settled there, and so
returned home. The same winter the Athenians blockaded Macedonia,
on the score of the league entered into by Perdiccas with the Argives
and Lacedaemonians, and also of his breach of his engagements on the
occasion of the expedition prepared by Athens against the Chalcidians
in the direction of Thrace and against Amphipolis, under the command
of Nicias, son of Niceratus, which had to be broken up mainly because
of his desertion. He was therefore proclaimed an enemy. And thus the
winter ended, and the fifteenth year of the war ended with it.</p>

<h3>Chapter XVII</h3>

<p>Sixteenth Year of the War - The Melian Conference - Fate of Melos</p>

<p>The next summer Alcibiades sailed with twenty ships to Argos and seized
the suspected persons still left of the Lacedaemonian faction to the
number of three hundred, whom the Athenians forthwith lodged in the
neighbouring islands of their empire. The Athenians also made an expedition
against the isle of Melos with thirty ships of their own, six Chian,
and two Lesbian vessels, sixteen hundred heavy infantry, three hundred
archers, and twenty mounted archers from Athens, and about fifteen
hundred heavy infantry from the allies and the islanders. The Melians
are a colony of Lacedaemon that would not submit to the Athenians
like the other islanders, and at first remained neutral and took no
part in the struggle, but afterwards upon the Athenians using violence
and plundering their territory, assumed an attitude of open hostility.
Cleomedes, son of Lycomedes, and Tisias, son of Tisimachus, the generals,
encamping in their territory with the above armament, before doing
any harm to their land, sent envoys to negotiate. These the Melians
did not bring before the people, but bade them state the object of
their mission to the magistrates and the few; upon which the Athenian
envoys spoke as follows:</p>

<p>Athenians. Since the negotiations are not to go on before the people,
in order that we may not be able to speak straight on without interruption,
and deceive the ears of the multitude by seductive arguments which
would pass without refutation (for we know that this is the meaning
of our being brought before the few), what if you who sit there were
to pursue a method more cautious still? Make no set speech yourselves,
but take us up at whatever you do not like, and settle that before
going any farther. And first tell us if this proposition of ours suits
you.</p>

<p>The Melian commissioners answered:
Melians. To the fairness of quietly instructing each other as you
propose there is nothing to object; but your military preparations
are too far advanced to agree with what you say, as we see you are
come to be judges in your own cause, and that all we can reasonably
expect from this negotiation is war, if we prove to have right on
our side and refuse to submit, and in the contrary case, slavery.</p>

<p>Athenians. If you have met to reason about presentiments of the future,
or for anything else than to consult for the safety of your state
upon the facts that you see before you, we will give over; otherwise
we will go on.</p>

<p>Melians. It is natural and excusable for men in our position to turn
more ways than one both in thought and utterance. However, the question
in this conference is, as you say, the safety of our country; and
the discussion, if you please, can proceed in the way which you propose.</p>

<p>Athenians. For ourselves, we shall not trouble you with specious pretences-
either of how we have a right to our empire because we overthrew the
Mede, or are now attacking you because of wrong that you have done
us- and make a long speech which would not be believed; and in return
we hope that you, instead of thinking to influence us by saying that
you did not join the Lacedaemonians, although their colonists, or
that you have done us no wrong, will aim at what is feasible, holding
in view the real sentiments of us both; since you know as well as
we do that right, as the world goes, is only in question between equals
in power, while the strong do what they can and the weak suffer what
they must.</p>

<p>Melians. As we think, at any rate, it is expedient- we speak as we
are obliged, since you enjoin us to let right alone and talk only
of interest- that you should not destroy what is our common protection,
the privilege of being allowed in danger to invoke what is fair and
right, and even to profit by arguments not strictly valid if they
can be got to pass current. And you are as much interested in this
as any, as your fall would be a signal for the heaviest vengeance
and an example for the world to meditate upon.</p>

<p>Athenians. The end of our empire, if end it should, does not frighten
us: a rival empire like Lacedaemon, even if Lacedaemon was our real
antagonist, is not so terrible to the vanquished as subjects who by
themselves attack and overpower their rulers. This, however, is a
risk that we are content to take. We will now proceed to show you
that we are come here in the interest of our empire, and that we shall
say what we are now going to say, for the preservation of your country;
as we would fain exercise that empire over you without trouble, and
see you preserved for the good of us both.</p>

<p>Melians. And how, pray, could it turn out as good for us to serve
as for you to rule?</p>

<p>Athenians. Because you would have the advantage of submitting before
suffering the worst, and we should gain by not destroying you.</p>

<p>Melians. So that you would not consent to our being neutral, friends
instead of enemies, but allies of neither side.</p>

<p>Athenians. No; for your hostility cannot so much hurt us as your friendship
will be an argument to our subjects of our weakness, and your enmity
of our power.</p>

<p>Melians. Is that your subjects' idea of equity, to put those who have
nothing to do with you in the same category with peoples that are
most of them your own colonists, and some conquered rebels?</p>

<p>Athenians. As far as right goes they think one has as much of it as
the other, and that if any maintain their independence it is because
they are strong, and that if we do not molest them it is because we
are afraid; so that besides extending our empire we should gain in
security by your subjection; the fact that you are islanders and weaker
than others rendering it all the more important that you should not
succeed in baffling the masters of the sea.</p>

<p>Melians. But do you consider that there is no security in the policy
which we indicate? For here again if you debar us from talking about
justice and invite us to obey your interest, we also must explain
ours, and try to persuade you, if the two happen to coincide. How
can you avoid making enemies of all existing neutrals who shall look
at case from it that one day or another you will attack them? And
what is this but to make greater the enemies that you have already,
and to force others to become so who would otherwise have never thought
of it?</p>

<p>Athenians. Why, the fact is that continentals generally give us but
little alarm; the liberty which they enjoy will long prevent their
taking precautions against us; it is rather islanders like yourselves,
outside our empire, and subjects smarting under the yoke, who would
be the most likely to take a rash step and lead themselves and us
into obvious danger.</p>

<p>Melians. Well then, if you risk so much to retain your empire, and
your subjects to get rid of it, it were surely great baseness and
cowardice in us who are still free not to try everything that can
be tried, before submitting to your yoke.</p>

<p>Athenians. Not if you are well advised, the contest not being an equal
one, with honour as the prize and shame as the penalty, but a question
of self-preservation and of not resisting those who are far stronger
than you are.</p>

<p>Melians. But we know that the fortune of war is sometimes more impartial
than the disproportion of numbers might lead one to suppose; to submit
is to give ourselves over to despair, while action still preserves
for us a hope that we may stand erect.</p>

<p>Athenians. Hope, danger's comforter, may be indulged in by those who
have abundant resources, if not without loss at all events without
ruin; but its nature is to be extravagant, and those who go so far
as to put their all upon the venture see it in its true colours only
when they are ruined; but so long as the discovery would enable them
to guard against it, it is never found wanting. Let not this be the
case with you, who are weak and hang on a single turn of the scale;
nor be like the vulgar, who, abandoning such security as human means
may still afford, when visible hopes fail them in extremity, turn
to invisible, to prophecies and oracles, and other such inventions
that delude men with hopes to their destruction.</p>

<p>Melians. You may be sure that we are as well aware as you of the difficulty
of contending against your power and fortune, unless the terms be
equal. But we trust that the gods may grant us fortune as good as
yours, since we are just men fighting against unjust, and that what
we want in power will be made up by the alliance of the Lacedaemonians,
who are bound, if only for very shame, to come to the aid of their
kindred. Our confidence, therefore, after all is not so utterly irrational.</p>

<p>Athenians. When you speak of the favour of the gods, we may as fairly
hope for that as yourselves; neither our pretensions nor our conduct
being in any way contrary to what men believe of the gods, or practise
among themselves. Of the gods we believe, and of men we know, that
by a necessary law of their nature they rule wherever they can. And
it is not as if we were the first to make this law, or to act upon
it when made: we found it existing before us, and shall leave it to
exist for ever after us; all we do is to make use of it, knowing that
you and everybody else, having the same power as we have, would do
the same as we do. Thus, as far as the gods are concerned, we have
no fear and no reason to fear that we shall be at a disadvantage.
But when we come to your notion about the Lacedaemonians, which leads
you to believe that shame will make them help you, here we bless your
simplicity but do not envy your folly. The Lacedaemonians, when their
own interests or their country's laws are in question, are the worthiest
men alive; of their conduct towards others much might be said, but
no clearer idea of it could be given than by shortly saying that of
all the men we know they are most conspicuous in considering what
is agreeable honourable, and what is expedient just. Such a way of
thinking does not promise much for the safety which you now unreasonably
count upon.</p>

<p>Melians. But it is for this very reason that we now trust to their
respect for expediency to prevent them from betraying the Melians,
their colonists, and thereby losing the confidence of their friends
in Hellas and helping their enemies.</p>

<p>Athenians. Then you do not adopt the view that expediency goes with
security, while justice and honour cannot be followed without danger;
and danger the Lacedaemonians generally court as little as possible.</p>

<p>Melians. But we believe that they would be more likely to face even
danger for our sake, and with more confidence than for others, as
our nearness to Peloponnese makes it easier for them to act, and our
common blood ensures our fidelity.</p>

<p>Athenians. Yes, but what an intending ally trusts to is not the goodwill
of those who ask his aid, but a decided superiority of power for action;
and the Lacedaemonians look to this even more than others. At least,
such is their distrust of their home resources that it is only with
numerous allies that they attack a neighbour; now is it likely that
while we are masters of the sea they will cross over to an island?</p>

<p>Melians. But they would have others to send. The Cretan Sea is a wide
one, and it is more difficult for those who command it to intercept
others, than for those who wish to elude them to do so safely. And
should the Lacedaemonians miscarry in this, they would fall upon your
land, and upon those left of your allies whom Brasidas did not reach;
and instead of places which are not yours, you will have to fight
for your own country and your own confederacy.</p>

<p>Athenians. Some diversion of the kind you speak of you may one day
experience, only to learn, as others have done, that the Athenians
never once yet withdrew from a siege for fear of any. But we are struck
by the fact that, after saying you would consult for the safety of
your country, in all this discussion you have mentioned nothing which
men might trust in and think to be saved by. Your strongest arguments
depend upon hope and the future, and your actual resources are too
scanty, as compared with those arrayed against you, for you to come
out victorious. You will therefore show great blindness of judgment,
unless, after allowing us to retire, you can find some counsel more
prudent than this. You will surely not be caught by that idea of disgrace,
which in dangers that are disgraceful, and at the same time too plain
to be mistaken, proves so fatal to mankind; since in too many cases
the very men that have their eyes perfectly open to what they are
rushing into, let the thing called disgrace, by the mere influence
of a seductive name, lead them on to a point at which they become
so enslaved by the phrase as in fact to fall wilfully into hopeless
disaster, and incur disgrace more disgraceful as the companion of
error, than when it comes as the result of misfortune. This, if you
are well advised, you will guard against; and you will not think it
dishonourable to submit to the greatest city in Hellas, when it makes
you the moderate offer of becoming its tributary ally, without ceasing
to enjoy the country that belongs to you; nor when you have the choice
given you between war and security, will you be so blinded as to choose
the worse. And it is certain that those who do not yield to their
equals, who keep terms with their superiors, and are moderate towards
their inferiors, on the whole succeed best. Think over the matter,
therefore, after our withdrawal, and reflect once and again that it
is for your country that you are consulting, that you have not more
than one, and that upon this one deliberation depends its prosperity
or ruin.</p>

<p>The Athenians now withdrew from the conference; and the Melians, left
to themselves, came to a decision corresponding with what they had
maintained in the discussion, and answered: "Our resolution, Athenians,
is the same as it was at first. We will not in a moment deprive of
freedom a city that has been inhabited these seven hundred years;
but we put our trust in the fortune by which the gods have preserved
it until now, and in the help of men, that is, of the Lacedaemonians;
and so we will try and save ourselves. Meanwhile we invite you to
allow us to be friends to you and foes to neither party, and to retire
from our country after making such a treaty as shall seem fit to us
both."</p>

<p>Such was the answer of the Melians. The Athenians now departing from
the conference said: "Well, you alone, as it seems to us, judging
from these resolutions, regard what is future as more certain than
what is before your eyes, and what is out of sight, in your eagerness,
as already coming to pass; and as you have staked most on, and trusted
most in, the Lacedaemonians, your fortune, and your hopes, so will
you be most completely deceived."</p>

<p>The Athenian envoys now returned to the army; and the Melians showing
no signs of yielding, the generals at once betook themselves to hostilities,
and drew a line of circumvallation round the Melians, dividing the
work among the different states. Subsequently the Athenians returned
with most of their army, leaving behind them a certain number of their
own citizens and of the allies to keep guard by land and sea. The
force thus left stayed on and besieged the place.</p>

<p>About the same time the Argives invaded the territory of Phlius and
lost eighty men cut off in an ambush by the Phliasians and Argive
exiles. Meanwhile the Athenians at Pylos took so much plunder from
the Lacedaemonians that the latter, although they still refrained
from breaking off the treaty and going to war with Athens, yet proclaimed
that any of their people that chose might plunder the Athenians. The
Corinthians also commenced hostilities with the Athenians for private
quarrels of their own; but the rest of the Peloponnesians stayed quiet.
Meanwhile the Melians attacked by night and took the part of the Athenian
lines over against the market, and killed some of the men, and brought
in corn and all else that they could find useful to them, and so returned
and kept quiet, while the Athenians took measures to keep better guard
in future.</p>

<p>Summer was now over. The next winter the Lacedaemonians intended to
invade the Argive territory, but arriving at the frontier found the
sacrifices for crossing unfavourable, and went back again. This intention
of theirs gave the Argives suspicions of certain of their fellow citizens,
some of whom they arrested; others, however, escaped them. About the
same time the Melians again took another part of the Athenian lines
which were but feebly garrisoned. Reinforcements afterwards arriving
from Athens in consequence, under the command of Philocrates, son
of Demeas, the siege was now pressed vigorously; and some treachery
taking place inside, the Melians surrendered at discretion to the
Athenians, who put to death all the grown men whom they took, and
sold the women and children for slaves, and subsequently sent out
five hundred colonists and inhabited the place themselves.</p>
