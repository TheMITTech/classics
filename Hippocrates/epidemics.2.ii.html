<A NAME="10"></A><B>Section I</B>
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="11"></A>Case I. Pythion, who lived by the Temple of the Earth, on the first day, 
<A NAME="12"></A>trembling commencing from his hands; acute fever, delirium. On the second, 
<A NAME="13"></A>all the symptoms were exacerbated. On the third, the same. On the fourth 
<A NAME="14"></A>alvine discharges scanty, unmixed, and bilious. On the fifth, all the symptoms 
<A NAME="15"></A>were exacerbated, the tremors remained; little sleep, the bowels constipated. 
<A NAME="16"></A>On the sixth sputa mixed, reddish. On the seventh, mouth drawn aside. On 
<A NAME="17"></A>the eighth, all the symptoms were exacerbated; the tremblings were again 
<A NAME="18"></A>constant; urine, from the beginning to the eighth day, thin, and devoid 
<A NAME="19"></A>of color; substances floating in it, cloudy. On the tenth he sweated; sputa 
<A NAME="20"></A>somewhat digested, had a crisis; urine thinnish about the crisis; but after 
<A NAME="21"></A>the crisis, on the fortieth day, an abscess about the anus, which passed 
<A NAME="22"></A>off by a strangury.
<A NAME="23"></A><BR><BR>Explanation of the characters. It is probably that the great discharge 
<A NAME="24"></A>of urine brought about the resolution of the disease, and the cure of the 
<A NAME="25"></A>patient on the fortieth day.
<A NAME="26"></A><BR><BR>Case i. Hermocrates, who lived by the New Wall, was seized with 
<A NAME="27"></A>fever. He began to have pain in the head and loins; an empty distention 
<A NAME="28"></A>of the hypochondrium; the tongue at first was parched; deafness at the 
<A NAME="29"></A>commencement; there was no sleep; not very thirsty; urine thick and red, 
<A NAME="30"></A>when allowed to stand it did not subside; alvine discharge very dry, and 
<A NAME="31"></A>not scanty. On the fifth, urine thin, had substances floating in it which 
<A NAME="32"></A>did not fall to the bottom; at night he was delirious. On the sixth, had 
<A NAME="33"></A>jaundice; all the symptoms were exacerbated; had no recollection. On the 
<A NAME="34"></A>seventh, in an uncomfortable state; urine thin, as formerly; on the following 
<A NAME="35"></A>days the same. About the eleventh day, all the symptoms appeared to be 
<A NAME="36"></A>lightened. Coma set in; urine thicker, reddish, thin substances below, 
<A NAME="37"></A>had no sediment; by degrees he became collected. On the fourteenth, fever 
<A NAME="38"></A>gone; had no sweat; slept, quite collected; urine of the same characters. 
<A NAME="39"></A>About the seventeenth, had a relapse, became hot. On the following days, 
<A NAME="40"></A>acute fever, urine thin, was delirious. Again, on the twentieth, had a 
<A NAME="41"></A>crisis; free of fever; had no sweat; no appetite through the whole time; 
<A NAME="42"></A>was perfectly collected; could not speak, tongue dry, without thirst; deep 
<A NAME="43"></A>sleep. About the twenty-fourth day he became heated; bowels loose, with 
<A NAME="44"></A>a thin, watery discharge; on the following days acute fever, tongue parched. 
<A NAME="45"></A>On the twenty-seventh he died. In this patient deafness continued throughout; 
<A NAME="46"></A>the urine either thick and red, without sediment, or thin, devoid of color, 
<A NAME="47"></A>and, having substances floating in it: he could taste 
<A NAME="48"></A>nothing.
<A NAME="49"></A><BR><BR>Explanation of the characters. It is probably that it was the suppression 
<A NAME="50"></A>of the discharges from the bowels which occasioned death on the twenty-seventh 
<A NAME="51"></A>day.
<A NAME="52"></A><BR><BR>Case ii. The man who was lodged in the Garden of Dealces: had heaviness 
<A NAME="53"></A>of the head and pain in the right temple for a considerable time, from 
<A NAME="54"></A>some accidental cause, was seized with fever, and took to bed. On the second, 
<A NAME="55"></A>there was a trickling of pure blood from the left nostril, but the alvine 
<A NAME="56"></A>discharges were proper, urine thin, mixed, having small substances floating 
<A NAME="57"></A>in it, like coarse barley meal, or semen. On the third, acute fever; stools 
<A NAME="58"></A>black, thin, frothy, a livid sediment in the dejections; slight coma; uneasiness 
<A NAME="59"></A>at the times he had to get up; sediment in the urine livid, and somewhat 
<A NAME="60"></A>viscid. On the fourth, slight vomiting of bilious, yellow matters, and, 
<A NAME="61"></A>after a short interval, of the color of verdigris; a few drops of pure 
<A NAME="62"></A>blood ran from the left nostril; stools the same; urine the same; sweated 
<A NAME="63"></A>about the head and clavicles; spleen enlarged, pain of the thigh on the 
<A NAME="64"></A>same side; loose swelling of the right hypochondrium; at night had no sleep, 
<A NAME="65"></A>slight delirium. On the sixth, stools black, fatty, viscid, fetid; slept, 
<A NAME="66"></A>more collected. On the seventh, tongue dry, thirsty, did not sleep; was 
<A NAME="67"></A>somewhat delirious; urine thin, not of a good color. On the eighth, stools 
<A NAME="68"></A>black, scanty, and compact; slept, became collected; not very thirsty. 
<A NAME="69"></A>On the ninth had a rigor, acute fever, sweated, a chill, was delirious, 
<A NAME="70"></A>strabismus of the right eye, tongue dry, thirsty, without sleep. On the 
<A NAME="71"></A>tenth, much the same. On the eleventh, became quite collected; free from 
<A NAME="72"></A>fever, slept, urine thin about the crisis. The two following days without 
<A NAME="73"></A>fever; it returned on the fourteenth, then immediately insomnolency and 
<A NAME="74"></A>complete delirium. On the fifteenth, urine muddy, like that which has been 
<A NAME="75"></A>shaken after the sediment has fallen to the bottom; acute fever, quite 
<A NAME="76"></A>delirious, did not sleep; knees and legs painful; after a suppository, 
<A NAME="77"></A>had alvine dejections of a black color. On the sixteenth, urine thin, had 
<A NAME="78"></A>a cloudy eneorema, was delirious. On the seventeenth, in the morning, extremities 
<A NAME="79"></A>cold, was covered up with the bedclothes, acute fever, general sweat, felt 
<A NAME="80"></A>relieved, more collected; not free of fever, thirsty, vomited yellow bile, 
<A NAME="81"></A>in small quantities; formed faeces passed from the bowels, but soon afterwards 
<A NAME="82"></A>black, scanty, and thin; urine thin, not well colored. On the eighteenth, 
<A NAME="83"></A>not collected, comatose. On the nineteenth, in the same state. On the twentieth, 
<A NAME="84"></A>slept; quite collected, sweated, free from fever, not thirsty, but the 
<A NAME="85"></A>urine thin. On the twenty-first, slight delirium; somewhat thirsty, pain 
<A NAME="86"></A>of the hypochondrium, and throbbing about the navel throughout. On sediment 
<A NAME="87"></A>in the urine, quite collected. Twenty-seventh, pain of the right hip joint; 
<A NAME="88"></A>urine thin and bad, a sediment; all the other symptoms milder. About the 
<A NAME="89"></A>twenty-ninth, pain of the right eye; urine thin. Fortieth, dejections pituitous, 
<A NAME="90"></A>white, rather frequent; sweated abundantly all over; had a complete 
<A NAME="91"></A>crisis.
<A NAME="92"></A><BR><BR>Explanation of the characters. It is probable that, by means of 
<A NAME="93"></A>the stools, the urine, and the sweat, this patient was cured in forty 
<A NAME="94"></A>days.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="95"></A><B>Section II</B>

<A NAME="96"></A><BR><BR>Case I. In Thasus, Philistes had headache of long continuance, 
<A NAME="97"></A>and sometimes was confined to bed, with a tendency to deep sleep; having 
<A NAME="98"></A>been seized with continual fevers from drinking, the pain was exacerbated; 
<A NAME="99"></A>during the night he, at first, became hot. On the first day, he vomited 
<A NAME="100"></A>some bilious matters, at first yellow, but afterwards of a verdigris-green 
<A NAME="101"></A>color, and in greater quantity; formed faeces passed from the bowels; passed 
<A NAME="102"></A>the night uncomfortably. On the second, deafness, acute fever; retraction 
<A NAME="103"></A>of the right hypochondrium; urine thin, transparent, had some small substances 
<A NAME="104"></A>like semen floating in it; delirium ferox about mid-day. On the third, 
<A NAME="105"></A>in an uncomfortable state. On the fourth, convulsions; all the symptoms 
<A NAME="106"></A>exacerbated. On the fifth, early in the morning, died.
<A NAME="107"></A><BR><BR>Explanation of the characters. It is probable that the death of 
<A NAME="108"></A>the patient on the fifth day is to be attributed to a phrenitis, with unfavorable 
<A NAME="109"></A>evacuations.
<A NAME="110"></A><BR><BR>Case i. Charion, who was lodged at the house of Demaenetus, contracted 
<A NAME="111"></A>a fever from drinking. Immediately he had a painful heaviness of the head; 
<A NAME="112"></A>did not sleep; bowels disordered, with thin and somewhat bilious discharges. 
<A NAME="113"></A>On the third day, acute fever; trembling of the head, but especially of 
<A NAME="114"></A>the lower lip; after a little time a rigor, convulsions; he was quite delirious; 
<A NAME="115"></A>passed the night uncomfortably. On the fourth, quiet, slept little, talked 
<A NAME="116"></A>incoherently. On the fifth, in pain; all the symptoms exacerbated; delirium; 
<A NAME="117"></A>passed the night uncomfortably; did not sleep. On the sixth, in the same 
<A NAME="118"></A>state. On the seventh had a rigor, acute fever, sweated all over his body; 
<A NAME="119"></A>had a crisis. Throughout the alvine discharges were bilious, scanty, and 
<A NAME="120"></A>unmixed; urine thin, well colored, having cloudy substances floating in 
<A NAME="121"></A>it. About the eighth day, passed urine of a better color, having a white 
<A NAME="122"></A>scanty sediment; was collected, free from fever for a season. On the ninth 
<A NAME="123"></A>it relapsed. About the fourteenth, acute fever. On the sixteenth, vomited 
<A NAME="124"></A>pretty frequently yellow, bilious matters. On the seventeenth had a rigor, 
<A NAME="125"></A>acute fever, sweated, free of fever; had a crisis; urine, after the relapse 
<A NAME="126"></A>and the crisis, well colored, having a sediment; neither was he delirious 
<A NAME="127"></A>in the relapse. On the eighteenth, became a little heated; some thirst, 
<A NAME="128"></A>urine thin, with cloudy substances floating in it; slight wandering in 
<A NAME="129"></A>his mind. About the nineteenth, free of fever, had a pain in his neck; 
<A NAME="130"></A>a sediment in the urine. Had a complete crisis on the 
<A NAME="131"></A>twentieth.
<A NAME="132"></A><BR><BR>Explanation of the characters. It is probable that the patient 
<A NAME="133"></A>was cured in twenty days, by the abundance of bilious stools and 
<A NAME="134"></A>urine.
<A NAME="135"></A><BR><BR>Case ii. The daughter of Euryanax, a maid, was taken ill of fever. 
<A NAME="136"></A>She was free of thirst throughout, but had no relish for food. Alvine discharges 
<A NAME="137"></A>small, urine thin, scanty, not well colored. In the beginning of the fever, 
<A NAME="138"></A>had a pain about the nates. On the sixth day, was free of fever, did not 
<A NAME="139"></A>sweat, had a crisis; the complaint about the nates came to a small suppuration, 
<A NAME="140"></A>and burst at the crisis. After the crisis, on the seventh day, had a rigor, 
<A NAME="141"></A>became slightly heated, sweated. On the eighth day after the rigor, had 
<A NAME="142"></A>an inconsiderable rigor; the extremities cold ever after. About the tenth 
<A NAME="143"></A>day, after a sweat which came on, she became delirious, and again immediately 
<A NAME="144"></A>afterwards was collected; these symptoms were said to have been brought 
<A NAME="145"></A>on by eating grapes. After an intermission of the twelfth day, she again 
<A NAME="146"></A>talked much incoherently; her bowels disordered with bilious, scanty, unmixed, 
<A NAME="147"></A>thin, acrid discharges; she required to get frequently up. She died on 
<A NAME="148"></A>the seventh day after the return of the delirium. At the commencement of 
<A NAME="149"></A>the disease she had pain in the throat, and it red throughout, uvula retracted, 
<A NAME="150"></A>defluxions abundant, thin, acrid; coughed, but had no concocted sputa; 
<A NAME="151"></A>during the whole time loathed all kinds of food, nor had the least desire 
<A NAME="152"></A>of anything; had no thirst, nor drank anything worth mentioning; was silent, 
<A NAME="153"></A>and never spoke a word; despondency; had no hopes of herself. She had a 
<A NAME="154"></A>congenital tendency to phthisis.
<A NAME="155"></A><BR><BR>Case v. The woman affected with quinsy, who lodged in the house 
<A NAME="156"></A>of Aristion: her complaint began in the tongue; speech inarticulate; tongue 
<A NAME="157"></A>red and parched. On the first day, felt chilly, and afterwards became heated. 
<A NAME="158"></A>On the third day, a rigor, acute fever; a reddish and hard swelling on 
<A NAME="159"></A>both sides of the neck and chest, extremities cold and livid; and livid; 
<A NAME="160"></A>respiration elevated; the drink returned by the nose; she could not swallow; 
<A NAME="161"></A>alvine and urinary discharges suppressed. On the fourth, all of the symptoms 
<A NAME="162"></A>were exacerbated. On the fifth she died of the quinsy.
<A NAME="163"></A><BR><BR>Explanation of the characters. It is probable that the cause of 
<A NAME="164"></A>death on the sixth day was the suppression of the discharges.
<A NAME="165"></A><BR><BR>Case V. The young man who was lodged by the Liars' Market was seized 
<A NAME="166"></A>with fever from fatigue, labor, and running out of season. On the first 
<A NAME="167"></A>day, the bowels disordered, with bilious, thin, and copious dejections; 
<A NAME="168"></A>urine thin and blackish; had no sleep; was thirsty. On the second all the 
<A NAME="169"></A>symptoms were exacerbated; dejections more copious and unseasonable; he 
<A NAME="170"></A>had no sleep; disorder of the intellect; slight sweat. On the third day, 
<A NAME="171"></A>restless, thirst, nausea, much tossing about, bewilderment, delirium; extremities 
<A NAME="172"></A>livid and cold; softish distention of the hypochondrium on both sides. 
<A NAME="173"></A>On the fourth, did not sleep; still worse. On the seventh he died. He was 
<A NAME="174"></A>about twenty years of age.
<A NAME="175"></A><BR><BR>Explanation of the characters. It is probable that the cause of 
<A NAME="176"></A>his death on the seventh day was the unseasonable practices mentioned above. 
<A NAME="177"></A>An acute affection.
<A NAME="178"></A><BR><BR>Case i. The woman who lodged at the house of Tisamenas had a troublesome 
<A NAME="179"></A>attack of iliac passion, much vomiting; could not keep her drink; pains 
<A NAME="180"></A>about the hypochondria, and pains also in the lower part of the belly; 
<A NAME="181"></A>constant tormina; not thirsty; became hot; extremities cold throughout, 
<A NAME="182"></A>with nausea and insomnolency; urine scanty and thin; dejections undigested, 
<A NAME="183"></A>thin, scanty. Nothing could do her any good. She died.
<A NAME="184"></A><BR><BR>Case ii. A woman of Pantimides, from a miscarriage, was taken ill 
<A NAME="185"></A>of fever. On the first day, tongue dry, thirst, nausea, insomnolency, belly 
<A NAME="186"></A>disordered, with thin, copious, undigested dejections. On the second day, 
<A NAME="187"></A>had a rigor, acute fever; alvine discharges copious; had no sleep. On the 
<A NAME="188"></A>third, pains greater. On the fourth, delirious. On the seventh she died. 
<A NAME="189"></A>Belly throughout loose, with copious, thin, undigested evacuations; urine 
<A NAME="190"></A>scanty, thin. An ardent fever.
<A NAME="191"></A><BR><BR>Case iii. Another woman, after a miscarriage about the fifth month, 
<A NAME="192"></A>the wife of Ocetes, was seized with fever. At first had sometimes coma 
<A NAME="193"></A>and sometimes insomnolency; pain of the loins; heaviness of the head. On 
<A NAME="194"></A>the second, the bowels were disordered, with scanty, thin, and at first 
<A NAME="195"></A>unmixed dejections. On the third, more copious, and worse; at night did 
<A NAME="196"></A>not sleep. On the fourth was delirious; frights, despondency; strabismus 
<A NAME="197"></A>of the right eye; a faint cold sweat about the head; extremities cold. 
<A NAME="198"></A>On the fifth day, all the symptoms were exacerbated; talked much incoherently, 
<A NAME="199"></A>and again immediately became collected; had no thirst; labored under insomnolency; 
<A NAME="200"></A>alvine dejections copious, and unseasonable throughout; urine scanty, thin, 
<A NAME="201"></A>darkish; extremities cold, somewhat livid. On the sixth day, in the same 
<A NAME="202"></A>state. On the seventh she died. Phrenitis.
<A NAME="203"></A><BR><BR>Case x. A woman who lodged near the Liars' Market, having then 
<A NAME="204"></A>brought forth a son in a first and difficult labor, was seized with fever. 
<A NAME="205"></A>Immediately on the commencement had thirst, nausea, and cardialgia; tongue 
<A NAME="206"></A>dry; bowels disordered, with thin and scanty dejections; had no sleep. 
<A NAME="207"></A>On the second, had slight rigor, acute fever; a faint cold sweat about 
<A NAME="208"></A>the head. On the third, painfully affected; evacuations from the bowels 
<A NAME="209"></A>undigested, thin, and copious. On the fourth, had a rigor; all the symptoms 
<A NAME="210"></A>exacerbated; insomnolency. On the fifth, in a painful state. On the sixth, 
<A NAME="211"></A>in the same state; discharges from the bowels liquid and copious. On the 
<A NAME="212"></A>seventh, had a rigor, fever acute; much thirst; much tossing about; towards 
<A NAME="213"></A>evening a cold sweat over all; extremities cold, could no longer be kept 
<A NAME="214"></A>warm; and again at night had a rigor; extremities could not be warmed; 
<A NAME="215"></A>she did not sleep; was slightly delirious, and again speedily collected. 
<A NAME="216"></A>On the eighth, about mid-day, she became warm, was thirsty, comatose, had 
<A NAME="217"></A>nausea; vomited small quantities of yellowish bile; restless at night, 
<A NAME="218"></A>did not sleep; passed frequently large quantities of urine without consciousness. 
<A NAME="219"></A>On the ninth, all the symptoms gave way; comatose, towards evening slight 
<A NAME="220"></A>rigors; small vomitings of bile. On the tenth, rigor; exacerbation of the 
<A NAME="221"></A>fever, did not sleep at all; in the morning passed much urine having a 
<A NAME="222"></A>sediment; extremities recovered their heat. On the eleventh, vomited bile 
<A NAME="223"></A>of a verdigris-green color; not long after had a rigor, and again the extremities 
<A NAME="224"></A>cold; towards evening a rigor, a cold sweat, much vomiting; passed a painful 
<A NAME="225"></A>night. On the twelfth, had copious black and fetid vomitings; much hiccup, 
<A NAME="226"></A>painful thirst. On the thirteenth, vomitings black, fetid, and copious; 
<A NAME="227"></A>rigor about mid-day, loss of speech. On the fourteenth, some blood ran 
<A NAME="228"></A>from her nose, she died. In this case the bowels were loose throughout; 
<A NAME="229"></A>with rigors: her age about seventeen. An ardent fever.
<BR><BR>

<A NAME="231"></A><BR><BR><B>1.</B> The year was southerly, rainy; no winds throughout. Droughts 
<A NAME="232"></A>having prevailed during the previous seasons of the year, the south winds 
<A NAME="233"></A>towards the rising of Arcturus were attended with much rain. Autumn gloomy 
<A NAME="234"></A>and cloudy, with copious rains. Winter southerly, damp, and soft. But long 
<A NAME="235"></A>after the solstice, and near the equinox, much wintery weather out of season; 
<A NAME="236"></A>and when now close to the equinox, northerly, and winterly weather for 
<A NAME="237"></A>no long time. The spring again southerly, calm, much rain until the dog-days. 
<A NAME="238"></A>Summer fine and hot; great suffocating heats. The Etesian winds blew small 
<A NAME="239"></A>and irregular; again, about the season of Arcturus, much rains with north 
<A NAME="240"></A>winds.
<A NAME="241"></A><BR><BR><B>2.</B> The year being southerly, damp, and soft towards winter, 
<A NAME="242"></A>all were healthy, except those affected with phthisis, of whom we shall 
<A NAME="243"></A>write afterwards.
<A NAME="244"></A><BR><BR><B>3.</B> Early in spring, along with the prevailing cold, there 
<A NAME="245"></A>were many cases of erysipelas, some from a manifest cause, and some not. 
<A NAME="246"></A>They were of a malignant nature, and proved fatal to many; many had sore-throat 
<A NAME="247"></A>and loss of speech. There were many cases of ardent fever, phrensy, aphthous 
<A NAME="248"></A>affections of the mouth, tumors on the genital organs; of ophthalmia, anthrax, 
<A NAME="249"></A>disorder of the bowels, anorexia, with thirst and without it; of disordered 
<A NAME="250"></A>urine, large in quantity, and bad in quality; of persons affected with 
<A NAME="251"></A>coma for a long time, and then falling into a state of insomnolency. There 
<A NAME="252"></A>were many cases of failure of crisis, and many of unfavorable crisis; many 
<A NAME="253"></A>of dropsy and of phthisis. Such were the diseases then epidemic. There 
<A NAME="254"></A>were patients affected with every one of the species which have been mentioned, 
<A NAME="255"></A>and many died. The symptoms in each of these cases were as 
<A NAME="256"></A>follows:
<A NAME="257"></A><BR><BR><B>4.</B> In many cases erysipelas, from some obvious cause, such 
<A NAME="258"></A>as an accident, and sometimes from even a very small wound, broke out all 
<A NAME="259"></A>over the body, especially, in persons about sixty years of age, about the 
<A NAME="260"></A>head, if such an accident was neglected in the slightest degree; and this 
<A NAME="261"></A>happened in some who were under treatment; great inflammation took place, 
<A NAME="262"></A>and the erysipelas quickly spread all over. in the most of them abscessed 
<A NAME="263"></A>ended in suppurations, and there were great fallings off (sloughing) of 
<A NAME="264"></A>the flesh, tendons, and bones; and the defluxion which seated in the part 
<A NAME="265"></A>was not like pus, but a sort of putrefaction, and the running was large 
<A NAME="266"></A>and of various characters. Those cases in which any of these things happened 
<A NAME="267"></A>about the head were accompanied with falling off of the hairs of the head 
<A NAME="268"></A>and chin, the bones were laid bare and separated, and there were excessive 
<A NAME="269"></A>runnings; and these symptoms happened in fevers and without fevers. But 
<A NAME="270"></A>these things were more formidable in appearance than dangerous; for when 
<A NAME="271"></A>the concoction in these cases turned to a these cases turned to a suppuration, 
<A NAME="272"></A>most of them recovered; but when the inflammation and erysipelas disappeared, 
<A NAME="273"></A>and when no abscess was formed, a great number of these died. In like manner, 
<A NAME="274"></A>the same things happened to whatever part of the body the disease wandered, 
<A NAME="275"></A>for in many cases both forearm and arm dropped off; and in those cases 
<A NAME="276"></A>in which it fell upon the sides, the parts there, either before or behind, 
<A NAME="277"></A>got into a bad state; and in some cases the whole femur and bones of the 
<A NAME="278"></A>leg and whole foot were laid bare. But of all such cases, the most formidable 
<A NAME="279"></A>were those which took place about the pubes and genital organs. Such was 
<A NAME="280"></A>the nature of these cases when attended with sores, and proceeding from 
<A NAME="281"></A>an external cause; but the same things occurred in fevers, before fevers, 
<A NAME="282"></A>and after fevers. fevers. But those cases in which an abscess was formed, 
<A NAME="283"></A>and turned to a suppuration, or a seasonable diarrhea or discharge of good 
<A NAME="284"></A>urine took place, were relieved thereby: but those cases in which none 
<A NAME="285"></A>of these symptoms occurred, but they disappeared without a crisis, proved 
<A NAME="286"></A>fatal. The greater number of these erysipelatous cases took place in the 
<A NAME="287"></A>spring, but were prolonged through the summer and during 
<A NAME="288"></A>autumn.
<A NAME="289"></A><BR><BR><B>5.</B> In certain cases there was much disorder, and tumors 
<A NAME="290"></A>about the fauces, and inflammations of the tongue, and abscesses about 
<A NAME="291"></A>the teeth. And many were attacked with impairment or loss of speech; at 
<A NAME="292"></A>first, those in the commencement of phthisis, but also persons in ardent 
<A NAME="293"></A>fever and in phrenitis.
<A NAME="294"></A><BR><BR><B>6.</B> The cases of ardent fever and phrenitis occurred early 
<A NAME="295"></A>in spring after the cold set in, and great numbers were taken ill at that 
<A NAME="296"></A>time, and these cases were attended with acute and fatal symptoms. The 
<A NAME="297"></A>constitution of the ardent fevers which then occurred was as follows: at 
<A NAME="298"></A>the commencement they were affected with coma, nausea, and rigors; fever 
<A NAME="299"></A>acute, not much thirst, nor delirium, slight epistaxis, the paroxysms for 
<A NAME="300"></A>the most part on even days; and, about the time of the paroxysms, forgetfulness, 
<A NAME="301"></A>loss of strength and of speech, the extremities, that is to say, the hands 
<A NAME="302"></A>and feet, at all times, but more especially about the time of the paroxysms, 
<A NAME="303"></A>were colder than natural; they slowly and imperfectly became warmed, and 
<A NAME="304"></A>again recovered their recollection and speech. They were constantly affected 
<A NAME="305"></A>either with coma, in which they got which they got no sleep, or with insomnolency, 
<A NAME="306"></A>attended with pains; most had disorders of the bowels, attended with undigested, 
<A NAME="307"></A>thin, and copious evacuations; urine copious, thin, having nothing critical 
<A NAME="308"></A>nor favorable about it; neither was there any other critical appearance 
<A NAME="309"></A>in persons affected thus; for neither was there any proper hemorrhage, 
<A NAME="310"></A>nor any other of the accustomed evacuations, to prove a crisis. They died, 
<A NAME="311"></A>as it happened, in an irregular manner, mostly about the crisis, but in 
<A NAME="312"></A>some instances after having lost their speech for a long time, and having 
<A NAME="313"></A>had copious sweats. These were the symptoms which marked the fatal cases 
<A NAME="314"></A>of ardent fever; similar symptoms occurred in the phrenitic cases; but 
<A NAME="315"></A>these were particularly free from thirst, and none of these had wild delirium 
<A NAME="316"></A>as in other cases, but they died oppressed by a bad tendency to sleep, 
<A NAME="317"></A>and stupor.
<A NAME="318"></A><BR><BR><B>7.</B> But there were also other fevers, as will be described. 
<A NAME="319"></A>Many had their mouths affected with aphthous ulcerations. There were also 
<A NAME="320"></A>many defluxions about the genital parts, and ulcerations, boils (phymata), 
<A NAME="321"></A>externally and internally, about the groins. Watery ophthalmies of a chronic 
<A NAME="322"></A>character, with pains; fungous excrescences of the eyelids, externally 
<A NAME="323"></A>and internally, called fig, which destroyed the sight of many persons. 
<A NAME="324"></A>There were fungous growths, in many other instances, on ulcers, especially 
<A NAME="325"></A>on those seated on the genital organs. There were many attacks of carbuncle 
<A NAME="326"></A>(anthrax) through the summer, and other affections, which are called "the 
<A NAME="327"></A>putrefaction" (seps); also large ecthymata, and large tetters (herpetes) 
<A NAME="328"></A>in many instances.
<A NAME="329"></A><BR><BR><B>8.</B> And many and serious complaints attacked many persons 
<A NAME="330"></A>in the region of the belly. In the first place, tenesmus, accompanied with 
<A NAME="331"></A>pain, attacked many, but more especially children, and all who had not 
<A NAME="332"></A>attained to puberty; and the most of these died. There were many cases 
<A NAME="333"></A>of lientery and of dysentery; but these were not attended with much pain. 
<A NAME="334"></A>The evacuations were bilious, and fatty, and thin, and watery; in many 
<A NAME="335"></A>instances the disease terminated in this way, with and without fever; there 
<A NAME="336"></A>were painful tormina and volvuli of a malignant kind; copious evacuations 
<A NAME="337"></A>of the contents of the guts, and yet much remained behind; and the passages 
<A NAME="338"></A>did not carry off the pains, but yielded with difficulty to the means administered; 
<A NAME="339"></A>for in most cases purgings were hurtful to those affected in this manner; 
<A NAME="340"></A>many died speedily, but in many others they held out longer. In a word, 
<A NAME="341"></A>all died, both those who had acute attacks and those who had chronic, most 
<A NAME="342"></A>especially from affections of the belly, for it was the belly which carried 
<A NAME="343"></A>them all off.
<A NAME="344"></A><BR><BR><B>9.</B> All persons had an aversion to food in all the afore-mentioned 
<A NAME="345"></A>complaints to a degree such as I never met with before, and persons in 
<A NAME="346"></A>these complaints most especially, and those recovering from them, and in 
<A NAME="347"></A>all other diseases of a mortal nature. Some were troubled with thirst, 
<A NAME="348"></A>and some not; and both in febrile complaints and in others no one drank 
<A NAME="349"></A>unseasonably or disobeyed injunctions.
<A NAME="350"></A><BR><BR><B>10.</B> The urine in many cases was not in proportion to the 
<A NAME="351"></A>drink administered, but greatly in excess; and the badness of the urine 
<A NAME="352"></A>voided was great, for it had not the proper thickness, nor concoction, 
<A NAME="353"></A>nor purged properly; for in many cases purgings by the bladder indicate 
<A NAME="354"></A>favorably, but in the greatest number they indicated a melting of the body, 
<A NAME="355"></A>disorder of the bowels, pains, and a want of crisis.
<A NAME="356"></A><BR><BR><B>11.</B> Persons laboring under phrenitis and causus were particularly 
<A NAME="357"></A>disposed to coma; but also in all other great diseases which occurred along 
<A NAME="358"></A>with fever. In the main, most cases were attended either by heavy coma, 
<A NAME="359"></A>or by short and light sleep.
<A NAME="360"></A><BR><BR><B>12.</B> And many other forms of fevers were then epidemic, of 
<A NAME="361"></A>tertian, of quartan, of nocturnal, of continual, of chronic, of erratic, 
<A NAME="362"></A>of fevers attended with nausea, and of irregular fevers. All these were 
<A NAME="363"></A>attended with much disorder, for the bowels in most cases were disordered, 
<A NAME="364"></A>accompanied with rigors, sweats not of a critical character, and with the 
<A NAME="365"></A>state of the urine as described. In most instances the disease was protracted, 
<A NAME="366"></A>for neither did the deposits which took place prove critical as in other 
<A NAME="367"></A>cases; for in all complaints and in all cases there was difficulty of crisis, 
<A NAME="368"></A>want of crisis, and protraction of the disease, but most especially in 
<A NAME="369"></A>these. A few had the crisis about the eightieth day, but in most instances 
<A NAME="370"></A>it (the disease?) left them irregularly. A few of them died of dropsy without 
<A NAME="371"></A>being confined to bed. And in many other diseases people were troubled 
<A NAME="372"></A>with swelling, but more especially in phthisical cases.
<A NAME="373"></A><BR><BR><B>13.</B> The greatest and most dangerous disease, and the one 
<A NAME="374"></A>that proved fatal to the greatest number, was consumption. With many persons 
<A NAME="375"></A>it commenced during the winter, and of these some were confined to bed, 
<A NAME="376"></A>and others bore up on foot; the most of those died early in spring who 
<A NAME="377"></A>were confined to bed; of the others, the cough left not a single person, 
<A NAME="378"></A>but it became milder through the summer; during the autumn, all these were 
<A NAME="379"></A>confined to bed, and many of them died, but in the greater number of cases 
<A NAME="380"></A>the disease was long protracted. Most of these were suddenly attacked with 
<A NAME="381"></A>these diseases, having frequent rigors, often continual and acute fevers; 
<A NAME="382"></A>unseasonable, copious, and cold sweats throughout; great coldness, from 
<A NAME="383"></A>which they had great difficulty in being restored to heat; the bowels variously 
<A NAME="384"></A>constipated, and again immediately in a loose state, but towards the termination 
<A NAME="385"></A>in all cases with violent looseness of the bowels; a determination downwards 
<A NAME="386"></A>of all matters collected about the lungs; urine excessive, and not good; 
<A NAME="387"></A>troublesome melting. The coughs throughout were frequent, and copious, 
<A NAME="388"></A>digested, and liquid, but not brought up with much pain; and even when 
<A NAME="389"></A>they had some slight pain, in all cases the purging of the matters about 
<A NAME="390"></A>the lungs went on mildly. The fauces were not very irritable, nor were 
<A NAME="391"></A>they troubled with any saltish humors; but there were viscid, white, liquid, 
<A NAME="392"></A>frothy, and copious defluxions from the head. But by far the greatest mischief 
<A NAME="393"></A>attending these and the other complaints, was the aversion to food, as 
<A NAME="394"></A>has been described. For neither been described. For neither had they any 
<A NAME="395"></A>relish for drink along with their food, but continued without thirst. There 
<A NAME="396"></A>was heaviness of the body, disposition to coma, in most cases swelling, 
<A NAME="397"></A>which ended in dropsy; they had rigors, and were delirious towards 
<A NAME="398"></A>death.
<A NAME="399"></A><BR><BR><B>14.</B> The form of body peculiarly subject to phthisical complaints 
<A NAME="400"></A>was the smooth, the whitish, that resembling the lentil; the reddish, the 
<A NAME="401"></A>blue-eyed, the leucophlegmatic, and that with the scapulae having the appearance 
<A NAME="402"></A>of wings: and women in like manner, with regard to the melancholic and 
<A NAME="403"></A>subsanguineous, phrenitic and dysenteric affections principally attacked 
<A NAME="404"></A>them. Tenesmus troubled young persons of a phlegmatic temperament. Chronic 
<A NAME="405"></A>diarrhoea, acrid and viscid discharges from the bowels, attacked those 
<A NAME="406"></A>who were troubled with bitter bile.
<A NAME="407"></A><BR><BR><B>15.</B> To all those which have been described, the season of 
<A NAME="408"></A>spring was most inimical, and proved fatal to the greatest numbers: the 
<A NAME="409"></A>summer was the most favorable to them, and the fewest died then; in autumn, 
<A NAME="410"></A>and under the Pleiades, again there died great numbers. It appears to me, 
<A NAME="411"></A>according to the reason of things, that the coming on of summer should 
<A NAME="412"></A>have done good in these cases; for winter coming on cures the diseases 
<A NAME="413"></A>of summer, and summer coming on removes the diseases of winter. And yet 
<A NAME="414"></A>the summer in question was not of itself well constituted, for it became 
<A NAME="415"></A>suddenly hot, southerly, and calm; but, not withstanding, it proved beneficial 
<A NAME="416"></A>by producing a change on the other constitution.
<A NAME="417"></A><BR><BR><B>16.</B> I look upon it as being a great part of the art to be 
<A NAME="418"></A>able to judge properly of that which has been written. For he that knows 
<A NAME="419"></A>and makes a proper use of these things, would appear to me not likely to 
<A NAME="420"></A>commit any great mistake in the art. He ought to learn accurately the constitution 
<A NAME="421"></A>of every one of the seasons, and of the diseases; whatever that is common 
<A NAME="422"></A>in each constitution and disease is good, and whatever is bad; whatever 
<A NAME="423"></A>disease will be protracted and end in death, and whatever will be protracted 
<A NAME="424"></A>and end in recovery; which disease of an acute nature will end in death, 
<A NAME="425"></A>and which in recovery. From these it is easy to know the order of the critical 
<A NAME="426"></A>days, and prognosticate from them accordingly. And to a person who is skilled 
<A NAME="427"></A>in these things, it is easy to know to whom, when, and how aliment ought 
<A NAME="428"></A>to be administered.
<A NAME="429"></A><BR><BR><B>Sixteen Cases of Disease</B>
<A NAME="430"></A><BR><BR>Case I. In Thasus, the Parian who lodged above the Temple of Diana 
<A NAME="431"></A>was seized with an acute fever, at first of a continual and ardent type; 
<A NAME="432"></A>thirsty, inclined to be comatose at first, and afterwards troubled with 
<A NAME="433"></A>insomnolency; bowels disordered at the beginning, urine thin. On the sixth 
<A NAME="434"></A>day, passed oily urine, was delirious. On the seventh, all the symptoms 
<A NAME="435"></A>were exacerbated; had no sleep, but the urine of the same characters, and 
<A NAME="436"></A>the understanding disordered; alvine dejections bilious and fatty. On the 
<A NAME="437"></A>eighth, a slight epistaxis; small vomiting of verdigris-green matters; 
<A NAME="438"></A>slept a little. On the ninth, in the same state. On the tenth, all the 
<A NAME="439"></A>symptoms gave way. On the eleventh, he sweated, but not over the whole 
<A NAME="440"></A>body; he became cold, but immediately recovered his heat again. On the 
<A NAME="441"></A>fourteenth, acute fever; discharges bilious, thin, and copious; substances 
<A NAME="442"></A>floating in the urine; he became incoherent. On the seventeenth, in a painful 
<A NAME="443"></A>state, for he had no sleep, and the fever was more intense. On the twentieth, 
<A NAME="444"></A>sweated all over; apyrexia, dejections bilious; aversion to food, comatose. 
<A NAME="445"></A>On the twenty-fourth, had a relapse. On the thirty-fourth, apyrexia; bowels 
<A NAME="446"></A>not confined; and he again recovered his heat. Fortieth, apyrexia, bowels 
<A NAME="447"></A>confined for no long time, aversion to food; had again slight symptoms 
<A NAME="448"></A>of fever, and throughout in an irregular form; apyrexia at times, and at 
<A NAME="449"></A>others not; for if the fever intermitted, and was alleviated for a little, 
<A NAME="450"></A>it immediately relapsed again; he used much and improper food; sleep bad; 
<A NAME="451"></A>about the time of the relapse he was delirious; passed thick urine at that 
<A NAME="452"></A>time, but troubled, and of bad characters; bowels at first confined, and 
<A NAME="453"></A>again loose; slight fevers of a continual type; discharges copious and 
<A NAME="454"></A>thin. On the hundred and twentieth day he died. In this patient the bowels 
<A NAME="455"></A>were constantly from the first either loose, with bilious, liquid, and 
<A NAME="456"></A>copious dejections, or constipated with hot and undigested faeces; the 
<A NAME="457"></A>urine throughout bad; for the most part coma, or insomnolency with pain; 
<A NAME="458"></A>continued aversion to food. Ardent fever.
<A NAME="459"></A><BR><BR>Explanation of the characters. It is probable that the weakness 
<A NAME="460"></A>produced by the fever, the phrenitis, and affection of the hypochondrium 
<A NAME="461"></A>caused death on the hundred and twentieth day.
<A NAME="462"></A><BR><BR>Case i. In Thasus, the woman who lodged near the Cold Water, on 
<A NAME="463"></A>the third day after delivery of a daughter, the lochial discharge not taking 
<A NAME="464"></A>place, was seized with acute fever, accompanied with rigors. But a considerable 
<A NAME="465"></A>time before delivery she was feverish, confined to bed, and loathed her 
<A NAME="466"></A>food. After the rigor which took place, continual and acute fevers, with 
<A NAME="467"></A>rigors. On the eighth and following days, was very incoherent, and immediately 
<A NAME="468"></A>afterwards became collected; bowels disordered, with copious, thin, watery, 
<A NAME="469"></A>and bilious stools; no thirst. On the eleventh was collected, but disposed 
<A NAME="470"></A>to coma; urine copious, thin, and black; no sleep. On the twentieth, slight 
<A NAME="471"></A>chills, and immediately afterwards was warm; slight incoherence; no sleep; 
<A NAME="472"></A>with regard to the bowels, in the same condition; urine watery, and copious. 
<A NAME="473"></A>On the twenty-seventh, free from fever; bowels constipated; not long afterwards 
<A NAME="474"></A>violent pain of the right hip-joint for a considerable time; fevers afterwards 
<A NAME="475"></A>supervened; urine watery. On the fortieth, complaints about the hip-joint 
<A NAME="476"></A>better; continued coughs, with copious, watery sputa; bowels constipated; 
<A NAME="477"></A>aversion to food; urine the same; fever not leaving her entirely, but having 
<A NAME="478"></A>paroxysms in an irregular form, sometimes present, sometimes not. On the 
<A NAME="479"></A>sixtieth, the coughs left her without a crisis, for no concoction of the 
<A NAME="480"></A>sputa took place, nor any of the usual abscesses; jaw on the right side 
<A NAME="481"></A>convulsively retracted; comatose, was again incoherent, and immediately 
<A NAME="482"></A>became collected; utter aversion to food; the jaw became relaxed; alvine 
<A NAME="483"></A>discharges small, and bilious; fever more acute, affected with rigors; 
<A NAME="484"></A>on the following days lost her speech, and again became collected, and 
<A NAME="485"></A>talked. On the eightieth she died. In this case the urine throughout was 
<A NAME="486"></A>black, thin, and watery; coma supervened; there was aversion to food, aversion 
<A NAME="487"></A>to food, despondency, and insomnolency; irritability, restlessness; she 
<A NAME="488"></A>was of a melancholic turn of mind.
<A NAME="489"></A><BR><BR>Explanation of the characters. It is probable that the suppression 
<A NAME="490"></A>of the lochial discharge caused death on the day.
<A NAME="491"></A><BR><BR>Case ii. In Thasus, Pythion, who was lodged above the Temple of 
<A NAME="492"></A>Hercules, from labor, fatigue, and neglected diet, was seized with strong 
<A NAME="493"></A>rigor and acute fever; tongue dry, thirsty, and bilious; had no sleep; 
<A NAME="494"></A>urine darkish, eneorema floating on the top of the urine, did not subside. 
<A NAME="495"></A>On the second day, about noon, coldness of the extremities, especially 
<A NAME="496"></A>about the hands and head; loss of speech and of articulation; breathing 
<A NAME="497"></A>short for a considerable time; recovered his heat; thirst; passed the night 
<A NAME="498"></A>quietly; slight sweats about the head. On the third, passed the day in 
<A NAME="499"></A>a composed state; in the evening, about sunset, slight chills; nausea, 
<A NAME="500"></A>agitation; passed the night in a painful state; had no sleep; small stools 
<A NAME="501"></A>of compact faeces passed from the bowels. On the fourth, in the morning, 
<A NAME="502"></A>composed; about noon all the symptoms became exacerbated; coldness, loss 
<A NAME="503"></A>of speech, and of articulation; became worse; recovered his heat after 
<A NAME="504"></A>a time; passed black urine, having substances floating in it; the night 
<A NAME="505"></A>quiet; slept. On the fifth, seemed to be lightened, but a painful weight 
<A NAME="506"></A>about the belly; thirsty, passed the night in a painful state. On the sixth, 
<A NAME="507"></A>in the morning, in a quiet state; in the evening the pains greater; had 
<A NAME="508"></A>a paroxysm; in the evening the bowels properly opened by a small clyster; 
<A NAME="509"></A>slept at night. On the seventh, during the day, in a state of nausea, somewhat 
<A NAME="510"></A>disturbed; passed urine of the appearance of oil; at night, much agitation, 
<A NAME="511"></A>was incoherent, did not sleep. On the eighth, in the morning, slept a little; 
<A NAME="512"></A>but immediately coldness, loss of speech, respiration small and weak; but 
<A NAME="513"></A>in the evening recovered his heat again; was delirious, but towards day 
<A NAME="514"></A>was somewhat lightened; stools small, bilious, and unmixed. On the ninth, 
<A NAME="515"></A>affected with coma, and with nausea when roused; not very thirsty; about 
<A NAME="516"></A>sunset he became restless and incoherent; passed a bad night. On the tenth, 
<A NAME="517"></A>in the morning, had become speechless; great coldness; acute fever; much 
<A NAME="518"></A>perspiration; he died. His sufferings were on the even 
<A NAME="519"></A>days.
<A NAME="520"></A><BR><BR>Explanation of the characters. It is probable that the excessive 
<A NAME="521"></A>sweats caused death on the tenth day.
<A NAME="522"></A><BR><BR>Case v. The patient affected with phrenitis, having taken to bed 
<A NAME="523"></A>on the first day, vomited largely of verdigris-green and thin matters; 
<A NAME="524"></A>fever, accompanied with rigors, copious and continued sweats all over; 
<A NAME="525"></A>heaviness of the head and neck, with pain; urine thin, substances floating 
<A NAME="526"></A>in the urine small, scattered, did not subside; had copious dejections 
<A NAME="527"></A>from the bowels; very delirious; no sleep. On the second, in the morning, 
<A NAME="528"></A>loss of speech; acute fever; he sweated, fever did not leave him; palpitations 
<A NAME="529"></A>over the whole body, at night, convulsions. On the third, all the symptoms 
<A NAME="530"></A>exacerbated; he died.
<A NAME="531"></A><BR><BR>Explanation of the characters. It is probable that the sweats and 
<A NAME="532"></A>convulsions caused death.
<A NAME="533"></A><BR><BR>Case V. In Larissa, a man, who was bald, suddenly was seized with 
<A NAME="534"></A>pain in the right thigh; none of the things which were administered did 
<A NAME="535"></A>him any good. On the first day, fever acute, of the ardent type, not agitated, 
<A NAME="536"></A>but the pains persisted. On the second, the pains in the thigh abated, 
<A NAME="537"></A>but the fever increased; somewhat tossed about; did not sleep; extremities 
<A NAME="538"></A>cold; passed a large quantity of urine, not of a good character. On the 
<A NAME="539"></A>third, the pain of the thigh ceased; derangement of the intellect, confusion, 
<A NAME="540"></A>and much tossing about. On the fourth, about noon, he died. An acute 
<A NAME="541"></A>disease.
<A NAME="542"></A><BR><BR>Case i. In Abdera, Pericles was seized with a fever of the acute, 
<A NAME="543"></A>continual type, with pain; much thirst, nausea, could not retain his drink; 
<A NAME="544"></A>somewhat swelled about the spleen, with heaviness of the head. On the first 
<A NAME="545"></A>day, had hemorrhage from the left nostril, but still the fever became more 
<A NAME="546"></A>violent; passed much muddy, white urine, which when allowed to stand did 
<A NAME="547"></A>not subside. On the second day, all the symptoms were exacerbated, yet 
<A NAME="548"></A>the urine was thick, and more inclined to have a sediment; the nausea less; 
<A NAME="549"></A>he slept. On the third, fever was milder; abundance of urine, which was 
<A NAME="550"></A>concocted, and had a copious sediment; passed a quiet night. On the fourth, 
<A NAME="551"></A>had a copious and warm sweat all over about noon; was free of fever, had 
<A NAME="552"></A>a crisis, no relapse. An acute affection.
<A NAME="553"></A><BR><BR>Case ii. In Abdera, the young woman who was lodged in the Sacred 
<A NAME="554"></A>Walk was seized with an ardent fever. She was thirsty, and could not sleep; 
<A NAME="555"></A>had menstruation for the first time. On the sixth, much nausea, flushing, 
<A NAME="556"></A>was chilly, and tossed about. On the seventh, in the same state; urine 
<A NAME="557"></A>thin,but of a good color; no disturbance about the bowels. On the eighth, 
<A NAME="558"></A>deafness, acute fever, insomnolency, nausea, rigors, became collected; 
<A NAME="559"></A>urine the same. On the ninth, in the same state, and also on the following 
<A NAME="560"></A>days; thus the deafness persisted. On the fourteenth, disorder of the intellect; 
<A NAME="561"></A>the fever abated. On the seventeenth, a copious hemorrhage from the nose; 
<A NAME="562"></A>the deafness slightly better; and on the following days, nausea, deafness, 
<A NAME="563"></A>and incoherence. On the twentieth, pain of the feet; deafness and delirium 
<A NAME="564"></A>left her; a small hemorrhage from the nose; sweat, apyrexia. On the twenty-fourth, 
<A NAME="565"></A>the fever returned, deafness again; pain of the feet remained; incoherence. 
<A NAME="566"></A>On the twenty-seventh, had a copious sweat, apyrexia; the deafness left 
<A NAME="567"></A>her; the pain of her feet partly remained; in other respects had a complete 
<A NAME="568"></A>crisis.
<A NAME="569"></A><BR><BR>Explanation of the characters. It is probable that the restoration 
<A NAME="570"></A>of health on the twentieth day was the result of the evacuation of 
<A NAME="571"></A>urine.
<A NAME="572"></A><BR><BR>Case iii. In Abdera, Anaxion, who was lodged near the with Thracian 
<A NAME="573"></A>Gates, was seized with an acute fever; pain of the right dry cough, without 
<A NAME="574"></A>expectoration during the first days, thirst, insomnolency; urine well colored, 
<A NAME="575"></A>copious, and thin. On the sixth, delirious; no relief from the warm applications. 
<A NAME="576"></A>On the seventh, in a painful state, for the fever while the pains did not 
<A NAME="577"></A>abate, and the cough was troublesome, and attended with dyspnoea. On the 
<A NAME="578"></A>eighth, I opened a vein at the elbow, and much blood, of a proper character, 
<A NAME="579"></A>flowed; the pains were abated, but the dry coughs continued. On the eleventh, 
<A NAME="580"></A>the fever diminished; slight sweats about the head; coughs, with more liquid 
<A NAME="581"></A>sputa; he was relieved. On the twentieth, sweat, apyrexia; but after the 
<A NAME="582"></A>crisis he was thirsty, and the expectorations were not good. On the twenty-seventh 
<A NAME="583"></A>the fever relapsed; he coughed, and brought up much concocted sputa: sediment 
<A NAME="584"></A>in the urine copious and white; he became free of thirst, and the respiration 
<A NAME="585"></A>was good. On the thirty-fourth, sweated all over, apyrexia general 
<A NAME="586"></A>crisis.
<A NAME="587"></A><BR><BR>Explanation of the characters. It is probable that the evacuation 
<A NAME="588"></A>of the sputa brought about the recovery on the thirty-fourth 
<A NAME="589"></A>day.
<A NAME="590"></A><BR><BR>Case x. In Abdera, Heropythus, while still on foot, had pain in 
<A NAME="591"></A>the head, and not long afterwards he took to bed; he lived near the High 
<A NAME="592"></A>Street. Was seized with acute fever of the ardent type; vomitings at first 
<A NAME="593"></A>of much bilious matter; thirst; great restlessness; urine thin, black, 
<A NAME="594"></A>substances sometimes floating high in it, and sometimes not; passed the 
<A NAME="595"></A>night in a painful state; paroxysms of the fever diversified, and for the 
<A NAME="596"></A>most part irregular. About the fourteenth day, deafness; the fever increased; 
<A NAME="597"></A>urine the same. On the twentieth and following days, much delirium. On 
<A NAME="598"></A>the thirtieth, copious hemorrhage from the nose, and became more collected; 
<A NAME="599"></A>deafness continued, but less; the fever diminished; on the following days, 
<A NAME="600"></A>frequent hemorrhages, at short intervals. About the sixtieth, the hemorrhages 
<A NAME="601"></A>ceased, but violent pain of the hip-joint, and increase of fever. Not long 
<A NAME="602"></A>afterwards, pains of all the inferior rule, that either the fever and deafness 
<A NAME="603"></A>increased, or, pains of the inferior parts were increased. About the eightieth 
<A NAME="604"></A>day, all the complaints gave way, without leaving any behind; for the urine 
<A NAME="605"></A>was of a good color, and had a copious sediment, while the delirium became 
<A NAME="606"></A>less. About the hundredth day, disorder of the bowels, with copious and 
<A NAME="607"></A>bilious evacuations, and these continued for a considerable time, and again 
<A NAME="608"></A>assumed the dysenteric form with pain; but relief of all the other complaints. 
<A NAME="609"></A>On the whole, the fevers went off, and the deafness ceased. On the hundred 
<A NAME="610"></A>and twentieth day, had a complete crisis. Ardent fever.
<A NAME="611"></A><BR><BR>Explanation of the characters. It is probable that the bilious 
<A NAME="612"></A>discharge brought about the recovery on the hundred and twentieth 
<A NAME="613"></A>day.
<A NAME="614"></A><BR><BR>Case X. In Abdera, Nicodemus was seized with fever from venery 
<A NAME="615"></A>and drinking. At the commencement he was troubled with nausea and cardialgia; 
<A NAME="616"></A>thirsty, tongue was parched; urine thin and dark. On the second day, the 
<A NAME="617"></A>fever exacerbated; he was troubled with rigors and nausea; had no sleep; 
<A NAME="618"></A>vomited yellow bile; urine the same; passed a quiet night, and slept. On 
<A NAME="619"></A>the third, a general remission; amelioration; but about sunset felt again 
<A NAME="620"></A>somewhat uncomfortable; passed an uneasy night. On the fourth, rigor, much 
<A NAME="621"></A>fever, general pains; urine thin, with substances floating in it; again 
<A NAME="622"></A>a quiet night. On the fifth, all the symptoms remained, but there was an 
<A NAME="623"></A>amelioration. On the sixth, some general pains; substances floating in 
<A NAME="624"></A>the urine; very incoherent. On the seventh, better. On the eighth, all 
<A NAME="625"></A>the other symptoms abated. On the tenth, and following days, there were 
<A NAME="626"></A>pains, but all less; in this case throughout, the paroxysms and pains were 
<A NAME="627"></A>greater on the even days. On the twentieth, the urine white and thick, 
<A NAME="628"></A>but when allowed to stand had no sediment; much sweat; seemed to be free 
<A NAME="629"></A>from fever; but again in the evening he became hot, with the same pains, 
<A NAME="630"></A>rigor, thirst, slightly incoherent. On the twenty-fourth, urine copious, 
<A NAME="631"></A>white, with an abundant sediment; a copious and warm sweat all over; apyrexia; 
<A NAME="632"></A>the fever came to its crisis.
<A NAME="633"></A><BR><BR>Explanation of the characters. It is probable that the cure was 
<A NAME="634"></A>owing to the bilious evacuations and the sweats.
<A NAME="635"></A><BR><BR>Case i. In Thasus, a woman, of a melancholic turn of mind, from 
<A NAME="636"></A>some accidental cause of sorrow, while still going about, became affected 
<A NAME="637"></A>with loss of sleep, aversion to food, and had thirst and nausea. She lived 
<A NAME="638"></A>near the Pylates, upon the Plain. On the first, at the commencement of 
<A NAME="639"></A>night, frights, much talking, despondency, slight fever; in the morning, 
<A NAME="640"></A>frequent spasms, and when they ceased, she was incoherent and talked obscurely; 
<A NAME="641"></A>pains frequent, great and continued. On the second, in the same state; 
<A NAME="642"></A>had no sleep; fever more acute. On the third, the spasms left her; but 
<A NAME="643"></A>coma, and disposition to sleep, and again awaked, started up, and could 
<A NAME="644"></A>not contain herself; much incoherence; acute fever; on that night a copious 
<A NAME="645"></A>sweat all over; apyrexia, slept, quite collected; had a crisis. About the 
<A NAME="646"></A>third day, the urine black, thin, substances floating in it generally round, 
<A NAME="647"></A>did not fall to the bottom; about the crisis a copious 
<A NAME="648"></A>menstruation.
<A NAME="649"></A><BR><BR>Case ii. In Larissa, a young unmarried woman was seized with a 
<A NAME="650"></A>fever of the acute and ardent type; insomnolency, thirst; tongue sooty 
<A NAME="651"></A>and dry; urine of a good color, but thin. On the second, in an uneasy state, 
<A NAME="652"></A>did not sleep. On the third, alvine discharges copious, watery, and greenish, 
<A NAME="653"></A>and on the following days passed such with relief. On the fourth, passed 
<A NAME="654"></A>a small quantity of thin urine, having substances floating towards its 
<A NAME="655"></A>surface, which did not subside; was delirious towards night. On the sixth, 
<A NAME="656"></A>a great hemorrhage from the nose; a chill, with a copious and hot sweat 
<A NAME="657"></A>all over; apyrexia, had a crisis. In the fever, and when it had passed 
<A NAME="658"></A>the crisis, the menses took place for the first time, for she was a young 
<A NAME="659"></A>woman. Throughout she was oppressed with nausea, and rigors; redness of 
<A NAME="660"></A>the face; pain of the eyes; heaviness of the head; she had no relapse, 
<A NAME="661"></A>but the fever came to a crisis. The pains were on the even 
<A NAME="662"></A>days.
<A NAME="663"></A><BR><BR>Case iii. Apollonius, in Abdera, bore up (under the fever?) for 
<A NAME="664"></A>some time, without betaking himself to bed. His viscera were enlarged, 
<A NAME="665"></A>and for a considerable time there was a constant pain about the liver, 
<A NAME="666"></A>and then he became affected with jaundice; he was flatulent, and of a whitish 
<A NAME="667"></A>complexion. Having eaten beef, and drunk unseasonably, he became a little 
<A NAME="668"></A>heated at first, and betook himself to bed, and having used large quantities 
<A NAME="669"></A>of milk, that of goats and sheep, and both boiled and raw, with a bad diet 
<A NAME="670"></A>otherwise, great mischief was occasioned by all these things; for the fever 
<A NAME="671"></A>was exacerbated, and of the food taken scarcely any portion worth mentioning 
<A NAME="672"></A>was passed from the bowels; the urine was thin and scanty; no sleep; troublesome 
<A NAME="673"></A>meteorism; much thirst; disposition to coma; painful swelling of the right 
<A NAME="674"></A>hypochondrium; extremities altogether coldish; slight incoherence, forgetfulness 
<A NAME="675"></A>of everything he said; he was beside himself. About the fourteenth day 
<A NAME="676"></A>after he betook himself to bed, had a rigor, became heated, and was seized 
<A NAME="677"></A>with furious delirium; loud cries, much talking, again composed, and then 
<A NAME="678"></A>coma came on; afterwards the bowels disordered, with copious, bilious, 
<A NAME="679"></A>unmixed, and undigested stools; urine black, scanty, and thin; much restlessness; 
<A NAME="680"></A>alvine evacuations of varied characters, either black, scanty, and verdigrisgreen, 
<A NAME="681"></A>or fatty, undigested, and acrid; and at times the dejections resembled 
<A NAME="682"></A>milk. About the twenty-fourth, enjoyed a calm; other matters in the same 
<A NAME="683"></A>state; became somewhat collected; remembered nothing that had happened 
<A NAME="684"></A>since he was confined to bed; immediately afterwards became delirious; 
<A NAME="685"></A>every symptom rapidly getting worn. About the thirtieth, acute fever; stools 
<A NAME="686"></A>copious and thin; was delirious; extremities cold; loss of speech. On the 
<A NAME="687"></A>thirty-fourth he died. In this case, as far as I saw, the bowels were disordered; 
<A NAME="688"></A>urine thin and black; disposition to coma; insomnolency; extremities cold; 
<A NAME="689"></A>delirious throughout. Phrenitis.
<A NAME="690"></A><BR><BR>Case iv. In Cyzicus, a woman who had brought forth twin daughters, 
<A NAME="691"></A>after a difficult labor, and in whom the lochial discharge was insufficient, 
<A NAME="692"></A>at first was seized with an acute fever, attended with chills; heaviness 
<A NAME="693"></A>of the head and neck, with pain; insomnolency from the commencement; she 
<A NAME="694"></A>was silent, sullen, and disobedient; urine thin, and devoid of color; thirst, 
<A NAME="695"></A>nausea for the most part; bowels irregularly disordered, and again constipated. 
<A NAME="696"></A>On the sixth, towards night, talked much incoherently; had no sleep. About 
<A NAME="697"></A>the eleventh day was seized with wild delirium, and again became collected; 
<A NAME="698"></A>urine black, thin, and again deficient, and of an oily appearance; copious, 
<A NAME="699"></A>thin, and disordered evacuations from the bowels. On the fourteenth, frequent 
<A NAME="700"></A>convulsions;extremities cold; not in anywise collected; suppression of 
<A NAME="701"></A>urine. On the sixteenth loss of speech. On the seventeenth, she died. 
<A NAME="702"></A>Phrenitis.
<A NAME="703"></A><BR><BR>Explanation of the characters. It is probable that death was caused, 
<A NAME="704"></A>on the seventeenth day, by the affection of the brain consequent upon her 
<A NAME="705"></A>accouchement.
<A NAME="706"></A><BR><BR>Case v. In Thasus, the wife of Dealces, who was lodged upon the 
<A NAME="707"></A>Plain, from sorrow was seized with an acute fever, attended with chills. 
<A NAME="708"></A>From first to last she wrapped herself up in her bedclothes; still silent, 
<A NAME="709"></A>she fumbled, picked, bored, and gathered hairs (from them); tears, and 
<A NAME="710"></A>again laughter; no sleep; bowels irritable, but passed nothing; when directed, 
<A NAME="711"></A>drank a little; urine thin and scanty; to the touch of the hand the fever 
<A NAME="712"></A>was slight; coldness of the extremities. On the ninth, talked much incoherently, 
<A NAME="713"></A>and again became composed and silent. On the fourteenth, breathing rare, 
<A NAME="714"></A>large, at intervals; and again hurried respiration. On the sixteenth, looseness 
<A NAME="715"></A>of the bowels from a stimulant clyster; afterwards she passed her drink, 
<A NAME="716"></A>nor could retain anything, for she was completely insensible; skin parched 
<A NAME="717"></A>and tense. On the twentieth, much talk, and again became composed; loss 
<A NAME="718"></A>of speech; respiration hurried. On the twenty-first she died. Her respiration 
<A NAME="719"></A>throughout was rare and large; she was totally insensible; always wrapped 
<A NAME="720"></A>up in her bedclothes; either much talk, or completely silent throughout. 
<A NAME="721"></A>Phrenitis.
<A NAME="722"></A><BR><BR>Case vi. In Meliboea, a young man having become heated by drinking 
<A NAME="723"></A>and much venery, was confined to bed; he was affected with rigors and nausea; 
<A NAME="724"></A>insomnolency and absence of thirst. On the first day much faeces passed 
<A NAME="725"></A>from the bowels along with a copious flux; and on the following days he 
<A NAME="726"></A>passed many watery stools of a green color; urine thin, scanty, and deficient 
<A NAME="727"></A>in color; respiration rare, large, at long intervals; softish distention 
<A NAME="728"></A>of the hypochondrium, of an oblong form, on both sides; continued palpitation 
<A NAME="729"></A>in the epigastric region throughout; passed urine of an oily appearance. 
<A NAME="730"></A>On the tenth, he had calm delirium, for he was naturally of an orderly 
<A NAME="731"></A>and quiet disposition; skin parched and tense; dejections either copious 
<A NAME="732"></A>and thin, or bilious and fatty. On the fourteenth, all the symptoms were 
<A NAME="733"></A>exacerbated; he became delirious, and talked much incoherently. On the 
<A NAME="734"></A>twentieth, wild delirium, On the twentieth, wild delirium, jactitation, 
<A NAME="735"></A>passed no urine; small drinks were retained. On the twenty-fourth he died. 
<A NAME="736"></A>Phrenitis.
