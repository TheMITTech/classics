<A NAME="start"></A>
<A NAME="10"></A>There are many varieties of curvature of the spine even in persons who 
<A NAME="11"></A>are in good health; for it takes place from natural conformation and from 
<A NAME="12"></A>habit, and the spine is liable to be bent from old age, and from pains. 
<A NAME="13"></A>Gibbosities (or projections backward) from falls generally take place when 
<A NAME="14"></A>one pitches on the nates, or falls on the shoulders. In this case some 
<A NAME="15"></A>one of the vertebrae must necessarily appear higher than natural, and those 
<A NAME="16"></A>on either side to a less degree; but yet no one generally has started out 
<A NAME="17"></A>of the line of the others, but every one has yielded a little, so that 
<A NAME="18"></A>a considerable extent of them is curved. On this account the spinal marrow 
<A NAME="19"></A>easily bears such distortions, because they are of a circular shape, and 
<A NAME="20"></A>not angular. The apparatus for the reduction in this case must be managed 
<A NAME="21"></A>in the following manner: a strong and broad board, having an oblong furrow 
<A NAME="22"></A>in it, is to be fastened in the ground, or, in place of the board, we may 
<A NAME="23"></A>scoop out an oblong furrow in the wall, about a cubit above the floor, 
<A NAME="24"></A>or at any suitable height, and then something like an oaken bench, of a 
<A NAME="25"></A>quadrangular shape, is to be laid along (the wall?) at a distance from 
<A NAME="26"></A>the wall, which will admit of persons to pass round if necessary, and the 
<A NAME="27"></A>bench is to be covered with robes, or anything else which is soft, but 
<A NAME="28"></A>does not yield much; and the patient is to be stoved with vapor, if necessary, 
<A NAME="29"></A>or bathed with much hot water, and then he is to be stretched along the 
<A NAME="30"></A>board on his face, with his arms laid along and bound to his body; the 
<A NAME="31"></A>middle, then, of a thong which is soft, sufficiently broad and long, and 
<A NAME="32"></A>composed of two cross straps of leather, is to be twice carried along the 
<A NAME="33"></A>middle of the patient's breast, as near the armpits as possible, then what 
<A NAME="34"></A>is over of the thongs at the armpits is to be carried round the shoulders, 
<A NAME="35"></A>and afterward the ends of the thong are to be fastened to a piece of wood 
<A NAME="36"></A>resembling a pestle; they are to be adapted to the length of the bench 
<A NAME="37"></A>laid below the patient, and so that the pestle-like piece of wood resting 
<A NAME="38"></A>against this bench may make extension. Another such band is to be applied 
<A NAME="39"></A>above the knees and the ankles, and the ends of the thongs fastened to 
<A NAME="40"></A>a similar piece of wood; and another thong, broad, soft, and strong, in 
<A NAME="41"></A>the form of a swathe, having breadth and length sufficient, is to be bound 
<A NAME="42"></A>tightly round the loins, as near the hips as possible; and then what remains 
<A NAME="43"></A>of this swathelike thong, with the ends of the thongs, must be fastened 
<A NAME="44"></A>to the piece of wood placed at the patient's feet, and extension in this 
<A NAME="45"></A>fashion is to be made upward and downward, equally and at the same time, 
<A NAME="46"></A>in a straight line. For extension thus made could do no harm, if properly 
<A NAME="47"></A>performed, unless one sought to do mischief purposely. But the physicians, 
<A NAME="48"></A>or some person who is strong, and not uninstructed, should apply the palm 
<A NAME="49"></A>of one hand to the hump, and then, having laid the other hand upon the 
<A NAME="50"></A>former, he should make pressure, attending whether this force should be 
<A NAME="51"></A>applied directly downward, or toward the head, or toward the hips. This 
<A NAME="52"></A>method of applying force is particularly safe; and it is also safe for 
<A NAME="53"></A>a person to sit upon the hump while extension is made, and raising himself 
<A NAME="54"></A>up, to let himself fall again upon the patient. And there is nothing to 
<A NAME="55"></A>prevent a person from placing a foot on the hump, and supporting his weight 
<A NAME="56"></A>on it, and making gentle pressure; one of the men who is practiced in the 
<A NAME="57"></A>palestra would be a proper person for doing this in a suitable manner. 
<A NAME="58"></A>But the most powerful of the mechanical means is this: if the hole in the 
<A NAME="59"></A>wall, or in the piece of wood fastened into the ground, be made as much 
<A NAME="60"></A>below the man's back as may be judged proper, and if a board, made of limetree, 
<A NAME="61"></A>or any other wood, and not too narrow, be put into the hole, then a rag, 
<A NAME="62"></A>folded several times or a small leather cushion, should be laid on the 
<A NAME="63"></A>hump; nothing large, however, should be laid on the back, but just as much 
<A NAME="64"></A>as may prevent the board from giving unnecessary pain by its hardness; 
<A NAME="65"></A>but the hump should be as much as possible on a line with the hole made 
<A NAME="66"></A>in the wall, so that the board introduced into it may make pressure more 
<A NAME="67"></A>especially at that especially at that spot. When matters are thus adjusted, 
<A NAME="68"></A>one person, or two if necessary, must press down the end of the board, 
<A NAME="69"></A>whilst others at the same time make extension and counter-extension as 
<A NAME="70"></A>along the body, as formerly described. Extension may also be made with 
<A NAME="71"></A>axles, which may either be fastened in the ground beside the bench, or 
<A NAME="72"></A>the post of the axles may be attached to the bench itself, if you will 
<A NAME="73"></A>make them perpendicular and overtopping (the bench?) a little at both ends, 
<A NAME="74"></A>or at either end of the bench. These powers are easily regulated, so as 
<A NAME="75"></A>to be made stronger or weaker, and they are of such force, that if one 
<A NAME="76"></A>were to have recourse to them for a mischievous purpose, and not as a remedy, 
<A NAME="77"></A>they would operate strongly in this way also; for by making merely extension 
<A NAME="78"></A>and counter-extension longitudinally, without any additional force, one 
<A NAME="79"></A>might make sufficient extension; and if, without making extension at all, 
<A NAME="80"></A>one were only to press down properly with the board, sufficient force might 
<A NAME="81"></A>be applied in this way. Such powers, then, are excellent which admit of 
<A NAME="82"></A>being so regulated, that they can be made weaker and stronger as required. 
<A NAME="83"></A>And the forces are applied in the natural way; for the pressure above forces 
<A NAME="84"></A>the displaced parts into their place. Natural extension restores parts 
<A NAME="85"></A>which have come too near one another to their natural position. I, then, 
<A NAME="86"></A>am acquainted with no powers which are better or more appropriate than 
<A NAME="87"></A>these; for extension along the spine downward has no proper hold at the 
<A NAME="88"></A>bone called the os sacrum; and extension upward, along the neck and head, 
<A NAME="89"></A>has indeed a hold; but extension thus made is unseemly to behold, and, 
<A NAME="90"></A>besides, if increased, may occasion much mischief otherwise. I once made 
<A NAME="91"></A>trial of the following plan. Having placed the patient on his back, I put 
<A NAME="92"></A>below the hump a bladder, not inflated, and afterward introduced air into 
<A NAME="93"></A>the bladder by means of a brass pipe connected with it. But the experiment 
<A NAME="94"></A>did not succeed; for, when the man was fairly extended, the bladder yielded, 
<A NAME="95"></A>and the air could not be forced into it; and, besides, the hump of the 
<A NAME="96"></A>patient was apt to slip off the distended bladder when they were pressed 
<A NAME="97"></A>together. But when I did not extend the man strongly, the bladder was swelled 
<A NAME="98"></A>up by the air, and the man became more bent forward than proper. I have 
<A NAME="99"></A>written this expressly; for it is a valuable piece of knowledge to learn 
<A NAME="100"></A>what things have been tried and have proved ineffectual, and wherefore 
<A NAME="101"></A>they did not succeed.
