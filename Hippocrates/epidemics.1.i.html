<A NAME="10"></A><B>Section I</B>
<A NAME="11"></A><BR><BR><B>First Constitution</B>
<A NAME="12"></A><BR><BR><B>1.</B> IN THASUS, about the autumn equinox, and under the Pleiades, 
<A NAME="13"></A>the rains were abundant, constant, and soft, with southerly winds; the 
<A NAME="14"></A>winter southerly, the northerly winds faint, droughts; on the whole, the 
<A NAME="15"></A>winter having the character of spring. The spring was southerly, cool, 
<A NAME="16"></A>rains small in quantity. Summer, for the most part, cloudy, no rain, the 
<A NAME="17"></A>Etesian winds, rare and small, blew in an irregular manner. The whole constitution 
<A NAME="18"></A>of the season being thus inclined to the southerly, and with droughts early 
<A NAME="19"></A>in the spring, from the preceding opposite and northerly state, ardent 
<A NAME="20"></A>fevers occurred in a few instances, and these very mild, being rarely attended 
<A NAME="21"></A>with hemorrhage, and never proving fatal. Swellings appeared about the 
<A NAME="22"></A>ears, in many on either side, and in the greatest number on both sides, 
<A NAME="23"></A>being unaccompanied by fever so as not to confine the patient to bed; in 
<A NAME="24"></A>all cases they disappeared without giving trouble, neither did any of them 
<A NAME="25"></A>come to suppuration, as is common in swellings from other causes. They 
<A NAME="26"></A>were of a lax, large, diffused character, without inflammation or pain, 
<A NAME="27"></A>and they went away without any critical sign. They seized children, adults, 
<A NAME="28"></A>and mostly those who were engaged in the exercises of the palestra and 
<A NAME="29"></A>gymnasium, but seldom attacked women. Many had dry coughs without expectoration, 
<A NAME="30"></A>and accompanied with hoarseness of voice. In some instances earlier, and 
<A NAME="31"></A>in others later, inflammations with pain seized sometimes one of the testicles, 
<A NAME="32"></A>and sometimes both; some of these cases were accompanied with fever and 
<A NAME="33"></A>some not; the greater part of these were attended with much suffering. 
<A NAME="34"></A>In other respects they were free of disease, so as not to require medical 
<A NAME="35"></A>assistance.
<A NAME="36"></A><BR><BR><B>2.</B> Early in the beginning of spring, and through the summer, 
<A NAME="37"></A>and towards winter, many of those who had been long gradually declining, 
<A NAME="38"></A>took to bed with symptoms of phthisis; in many cases formerly of a doubtful 
<A NAME="39"></A>character the disease then became confirmed; in these the constitution 
<A NAME="40"></A>inclined to the phthisical. Many, and, in fact, the most of them, died; 
<A NAME="41"></A>and of those confined to bed, I do not know if a single individual survived 
<A NAME="42"></A>for any considerable time; they died more suddenly than is common in such 
<A NAME="43"></A>cases. But other diseases, of a protracted character, and attended with 
<A NAME="44"></A>fever, were well supported, and did not prove fatal: of these we will give 
<A NAME="45"></A>a description afterwards. Consumption was the most considerable of the 
<A NAME="46"></A>diseases which then prevailed, and the only one which proved fatal to many 
<A NAME="47"></A>persons. Most of them were affected by these diseases in the following 
<A NAME="48"></A>manner: fevers accompanied with rigors, of the continual type, acute, having 
<A NAME="49"></A>no complete intermissions, but of the form of the semi-tertians, being 
<A NAME="50"></A>milder the one day, and the next having an exacerbation, and increasing 
<A NAME="51"></A>in violence; constant sweats, but not diffused over the whole body; extremities 
<A NAME="52"></A>very cold, and warmed with difficulty; bowels disordered, with bilious, 
<A NAME="53"></A>scanty, unmixed, thin, pungent, and frequent dejections. The urine was 
<A NAME="54"></A>thin, colorless, unconcocted, or thick, with a deficient sediment, not 
<A NAME="55"></A>settling favorably, but casting down a crude and unseasonable sediment. 
<A NAME="56"></A>Sputa small, dense, concocted, but brought up rarely and with difficulty; 
<A NAME="57"></A>and in those who encountered the most violent symptoms there was no concoction 
<A NAME="58"></A>at all, but they continued throughout spitting crude matters. Their fauces, 
<A NAME="59"></A>in most of them, were painful from first to last, having redness with inflammation; 
<A NAME="60"></A>defluxions thin, small and acrid; they were soon wasted and became worse, 
<A NAME="61"></A>having no appetite for any kind of food throughout; no thirst; most persons 
<A NAME="62"></A>delirious when near death. So much concerning the phthisical 
<A NAME="63"></A>affections.
<A NAME="64"></A><BR><BR><B>3.</B> In the course of the summer and autumn many fevers of 
<A NAME="65"></A>the continual type, but not violent; they attacked persons who had been 
<A NAME="66"></A>long indisposed, but who were otherwise not in an uncomfortable state. 
<A NAME="67"></A>In most cases the bowels were disordered in a very moderate degree, and 
<A NAME="68"></A>they did not suffer thereby in any manner worth mentioning; the urine was 
<A NAME="69"></A>generally well colored, clear, thin, and after a time becoming concocted 
<A NAME="70"></A>near the crisis. They had not much cough, nor it troublesome; they were 
<A NAME="71"></A>not in appetite, for it was necessary to give them food (on the whole, 
<A NAME="72"></A>persons laboring under phthisis were not affected in the usual manner). 
<A NAME="73"></A>They were affected with fevers, rigors, and deficient sweats, with varied 
<A NAME="74"></A>and irregular paroxysms, in general not intermitting, but having exacerbations 
<A NAME="75"></A>in the tertian form. The earliest crisis which occurred was about the twentieth 
<A NAME="76"></A>day, in most about the fortieth, and in many about the eightieth. But there 
<A NAME="77"></A>were cases in which it did not leave them thus at all, but in an irregular 
<A NAME="78"></A>manner, and without any crisis; in most of these the fevers, after a brief 
<A NAME="79"></A>interval, relapsed again; and from these relapses they came to a crisis 
<A NAME="80"></A>in the same periods; but in many they were prolonged so that the disease 
<A NAME="81"></A>was not gone at the approach of winter. Of all those which are described 
<A NAME="82"></A>under this constitution, the phthisical diseases alone were of a fatal 
<A NAME="83"></A>character; for in all the others the patients bore up well, and did not 
<A NAME="84"></A>die of the other fevers.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="85"></A><B>Section II</B>

<A NAME="86"></A><BR><BR><B>Second Constitution</B>
<A NAME="87"></A><BR><BR><B>1.</B> In Thasus, early in autumn, the winter suddenly set in 
<A NAME="88"></A>rainy before the usual time, with much northerly and southerly winds. These 
<A NAME="89"></A>things all continued so during the season of the Pleiades, and until their 
<A NAME="90"></A>setting. The winter was northerly, the rains frequent, in torrents, and 
<A NAME="91"></A>large, with snow, but with a frequent mixture of fair weather. These things 
<A NAME="92"></A>were all so, but the setting in of the cold was not much out of season. 
<A NAME="93"></A>After the winter solstice, and at the time when the zephyr usually begins 
<A NAME="94"></A>to blow, severe winterly storms out of season, with much northerly wind, 
<A NAME="95"></A>snow, continued and copious rains; the sky tempestuous and clouded; these 
<A NAME="96"></A>things were protracted, and did not remit until the equinox. The spring 
<A NAME="97"></A>was cold, northerly, rainy, and clouded; the summer was not very sultry, 
<A NAME="98"></A>the Etesian winds blew constant, but quickly afterwards, about the rising 
<A NAME="99"></A>of Arcturus, there were again many rains with north winds. The whole season 
<A NAME="100"></A>being wet, cold, and northerly, people were, for the most part, healthy 
<A NAME="101"></A>during winter; but early in the spring very many, indeed, the greater part, 
<A NAME="102"></A>were valetudinary. At first ophthalmies set in, with rheums, pains, unconcocted 
<A NAME="103"></A>discharges, small concretions, generally breaking with difficulty, in most 
<A NAME="104"></A>instances they relapsed, and they did not cease until late in autumn. During 
<A NAME="105"></A>summer and autumn there were dysenteric affections, attacks of tenesmus 
<A NAME="106"></A>and lientery, bilious diarrhoea, with thin, copious, undigested, and acrid 
<A NAME="107"></A>dejections, and sometimes with watery stools; many had copious defluxions, 
<A NAME="108"></A>with pain, of a bilious, watery, slimy, purulent nature, attended with 
<A NAME="109"></A>strangury, not connected with disease of the kidneys, but one complaint 
<A NAME="110"></A>succeeding the other; vomitings of bile, phlegm, and undigested food, sweats, 
<A NAME="111"></A>in all cases a reduncance of humors. In many instances these complaints 
<A NAME="112"></A>were unattended with fever, and did not prevent the patients from walking 
<A NAME="113"></A>about, but some cases were febrile, as will be described. In some all those 
<A NAME="114"></A>described below occurred with pain. During autumn, and at the commencement 
<A NAME="115"></A>of winter, there were phthisical complaints, continual fevers; and, in 
<A NAME="116"></A>a few cases, ardent; some diurnal, others nocturnal, semi-tertians, true 
<A NAME="117"></A>tertians, quartans, irregular fevers.
<A NAME="118"></A><BR><BR><B>2.</B> All these fevers described attacked great numbers. All 
<A NAME="119"></A>these fevers attacked the smallest numbers, and the patients suffered the 
<A NAME="120"></A>least from them, for there were no hemorrhages, except a few and to a small 
<A NAME="121"></A>amount, nor was there delirium; all the other complaints were slight; in 
<A NAME="122"></A>these the crises were regular, in most instances, with the intermittents, 
<A NAME="123"></A>in seventeen days; and I know no instance of a person dying of causus, 
<A NAME="124"></A>nor becoming phrenitic. The tertians were more numerous than the ardent 
<A NAME="125"></A>fevers, and attended with more pain; but these all had four periods in 
<A NAME="126"></A>regular succession from the first attack, and they had a complete crisis 
<A NAME="127"></A>in seven, without a relapse in any instance. The quartans attacked many 
<A NAME="128"></A>at first, in the form of regular quartans, but in no few cases a transition 
<A NAME="129"></A>from other fevers and diseases into quartans took place; they were protracted, 
<A NAME="130"></A>as is wont with them, indeed, more so than usual. Quotidian, nocturnal, 
<A NAME="131"></A>and wandering fevers attacked many persons, some of whom continued to keep 
<A NAME="132"></A>up, and others were confined to bed. In most instances these fevers were 
<A NAME="133"></A>prolonged under the Pleiades and till winter. Many persons, and more especially 
<A NAME="134"></A>children, had convulsions from the commencement; and they had fever, and 
<A NAME="135"></A>the convulsions supervened upon the fevers; in most cases they were protracted, 
<A NAME="136"></A>but free from danger, unless in those who were in a deadly state from other 
<A NAME="137"></A>complaints. Those fevers which were continual in the main, and with no 
<A NAME="138"></A>intermissions, but having exacerbations in the tertian form, there being 
<A NAME="139"></A>remissions the one day and exacerbations the next, were the most violent 
<A NAME="140"></A>of all those which occurred at that time, and the most protracted, and 
<A NAME="141"></A>occurring with the greatest pains, beginning mildly, always on the whole 
<A NAME="142"></A>increasing, and being exacerbated, and always turning worse, having small 
<A NAME="143"></A>remissions, and after an abatement having more violent paroxysms, and growing 
<A NAME="144"></A>worse, for the most part, on the critical days. Rigors, in all cases, took 
<A NAME="145"></A>place in an irregular and uncertain manner, very rare and weak in them, 
<A NAME="146"></A>but greater in all other fevers; frequent sweats, but most seldom in them, 
<A NAME="147"></A>bringing no alleviation, but, on the contrary, doing mischief. Much cold 
<A NAME="148"></A>of the extremities in them, and these were warmed with difficulty. Insomnolency, 
<A NAME="149"></A>for the most part, especially in these fevers, and again a disposition 
<A NAME="150"></A>to coma. The bowels, in all diseases, were disordered, and in a bad state, 
<A NAME="151"></A>but worst of all in these. The urine, in most of them, was either thin 
<A NAME="152"></A>and crude, yellow, and after a time with slight symptoms of concoction 
<A NAME="153"></A>in a critical form, or having the proper thickness, but muddy, and neither 
<A NAME="154"></A>settling nor subsiding; or having small and bad, and crude sediments; these 
<A NAME="155"></A>being the worst of all. Coughs attended these fevers, but I cannot state 
<A NAME="156"></A>that any harm or good ever resulted from the cough.
<A NAME="157"></A><BR><BR><B>3.</B> The most of these were protracted and troublesome, went 
<A NAME="158"></A>on in a very disorderly and irregular form, and, for the most part, did 
<A NAME="159"></A>in a crisis, either in the fatal cases or in the others; for if it left 
<A NAME="160"></A>some of them for a season it soon returned again. In a few instances the 
<A NAME="161"></A>lever terminated with a crisis; in the earliest of these about the eightieth 
<A NAME="162"></A>day, and some of these relapsed, so that most of them were not free from 
<A NAME="163"></A>the fever during the winter; but the fever left most of them without a 
<A NAME="164"></A>crisis, and these things happened alike to those who recovered and to those 
<A NAME="165"></A>who did not. There being much want of crisis and much variety as to these 
<A NAME="166"></A>diseases, the greatest and worst symptom attended the most of them, namely, 
<A NAME="167"></A>a loathing of all articles of food, more especially with those who had 
<A NAME="168"></A>otherwise fatal symptoms; but they were not unseasonably thirsty in such 
<A NAME="169"></A>fevers. After a length of time, with much suffering and great wasting, 
<A NAME="170"></A>abscesses were formed in these cases, either unusually large, so that the 
<A NAME="171"></A>patients could not support them, or unusually small, so that they did no 
<A NAME="172"></A>good, but soon relapsed and speedily got worse. The diseases which attacked 
<A NAME="173"></A>them were in the form of dysenteries, tenesmus, lientery, and fluxes; but, 
<A NAME="174"></A>in some cases, there were dropsies, with or without these complaints. Whatever 
<A NAME="175"></A>attacked them violently speedily cut them off, or again, did them no good. 
<A NAME="176"></A>Small rashes, and not corresponding to the violence of the disease, and 
<A NAME="177"></A>quickly disappearing, or swellings occurred about the ears, which were 
<A NAME="178"></A>not resolved, and brought on no crisis. In some they were determined to 
<A NAME="179"></A>the joints, and especially to the hip-joint, terminating critically with 
<A NAME="180"></A>a few, and quickly again increasing to its original 
<A NAME="181"></A>habit.
<A NAME="182"></A><BR><BR><B>4.</B> People died of all these diseases, but mostly of these 
<A NAME="183"></A>fevers, and notably infants just weaned, and older children, until eight 
<A NAME="184"></A>or ten years of age, and those before puberty. These things occurred to 
<A NAME="185"></A>those affected with the complaints described above, and to many persons 
<A NAME="186"></A>at first without them. The only favorable symptom, and the greatest of 
<A NAME="187"></A>those which occurred, and what saved most of those who were in the greatest 
<A NAME="188"></A>dangers, was the conversion of it to a strangury, and when, in addition 
<A NAME="189"></A>to this, abscesses were formed. The strangury attacked, most especially, 
<A NAME="190"></A>persons of the ages I have mentioned, but it also occurred in many others, 
<A NAME="191"></A>both of those who were not confined to bed and those who were. There was 
<A NAME="192"></A>a speedy and great change in all these cases. For the bowels, if they happened 
<A NAME="193"></A>previously to have watery discharges of a bad character, became regular, 
<A NAME="194"></A>they got an appetite for food, and the fevers were mild afterwards. But, 
<A NAME="195"></A>with regard to the strangury itself, the symptoms were protracted and painful. 
<A NAME="196"></A>Their urine was copious, thick, of various characters, red, mixed with 
<A NAME="197"></A>pus, and was passed with pain. These all recovered, and I did not see a 
<A NAME="198"></A>single instance of death among them.
<A NAME="199"></A><BR><BR><B>5.</B> With regard to the dangers of these cases, one must always 
<A NAME="200"></A>attend to the seasonable concoction of all the evacuations, and to the 
<A NAME="201"></A>favorable and critical abscesses. The concoctions indicate a speedy crisis 
<A NAME="202"></A>and recovery of health; crude and undigested evacuations, and those which 
<A NAME="203"></A>are converted into bad abscesses, indicate either want of crisis, or pains, 
<A NAME="204"></A>or prolongation of the disease, or death, or relapses; which of these it 
<A NAME="205"></A>is to be must be determined from other circumstances. The physician must 
<A NAME="206"></A>be able to tell the antecedents, know the present, and foretell the future- 
<A NAME="207"></A>must mediate these things, and have two special objects in view with regard 
<A NAME="208"></A>to disease, namely, to do good or to do no harm. The art consists in three 
<A NAME="209"></A>things- the disease, the patient, and the physician. The physician is the 
<A NAME="210"></A>servant of the art, and the patient must combat the disease along with 
<A NAME="211"></A>the physician.
<A NAME="212"></A><BR><BR><B>6.</B> Pains about the head and neck, and heaviness of the same 
<A NAME="213"></A>along with pain, occur either without fevers or in fevers. Convulsions 
<A NAME="214"></A>occurring in persons attacked with frenzy, and having vomitings of verdigris-green 
<A NAME="215"></A>bile, in some cases quickly prove fatal. In ardent fevers, and in those 
<A NAME="216"></A>other fevers in which there is pain of the neck, heaviness of the temples, 
<A NAME="217"></A>mistiness about the eyes, and distention about the hypochondriac region, 
<A NAME="218"></A>not unattended with pain, hemorrhage from the nose takes place, but those 
<A NAME="219"></A>who have heaviness of the whole head, cardialgia and nausea, vomit bilious 
<A NAME="220"></A>and pituitous matters; children, in such affections, are generally attacked 
<A NAME="221"></A>with convulsions, and women have these and also pains of the uterus; whereas, 
<A NAME="222"></A>in elder persons, and those in whom the heat is already more subdued, these 
<A NAME="223"></A>cases end in paralysis, mania, and loss of sight.
<A NAME="224"></A><BR><BR><B>Third Constitution</B>
<A NAME="225"></A><BR><BR><B>7.</B> In Thasus, a little before and during the season of Arcturus, 
<A NAME="226"></A>there were frequent and great rains, with northerly winds. About the equinox, 
<A NAME="227"></A>and till the setting of the Pleiades, there were a few southerly rains: 
<A NAME="228"></A>the winter northerly and parched, cold, with great winds and snow. Great 
<A NAME="229"></A>storms about the equinox, the spring northerly, dryness, rains few and 
<A NAME="230"></A>cold. About the summer solstice, scanty rains, and great cold until near 
<A NAME="231"></A>the season of the Dog-star. After the Dog-days, until the season of Arcturus, 
<A NAME="232"></A>the summer hot, great droughts, not in intervals, but continued and severe: 
<A NAME="233"></A>no rain; the Etesian winds blew; about the season of Arcturus southerly 
<A NAME="234"></A>rains until the equinox.
<A NAME="235"></A><BR><BR><B>8.</B> In this state of things, during winter, paraplegia set 
<A NAME="236"></A>in, and attacked many, and some died speedily; and otherwise the disease 
<A NAME="237"></A>prevailed much in an epidemical form, but persons remained free from all 
<A NAME="238"></A>other diseases. Early in the spring, ardent fevers commenced and continued 
<A NAME="239"></A>through the summer until the equinox. Those then that were attacked immediately 
<A NAME="240"></A>after the commencement of the spring and summer, for the most part recovered, 
<A NAME="241"></A>and but few of them died. But when the autumn and the rains had set in, 
<A NAME="242"></A>they were of a fatal character, and the greater part then died. When in 
<A NAME="243"></A>these attacks of ardent fevers there was a proper and copious hemorrhage 
<A NAME="244"></A>from the nose, they were generally saved by it, and I do not know a single 
<A NAME="245"></A>person who had a proper hemorrhage who died in this constitution. Philiscus, 
<A NAME="246"></A>Epaminon, and Silenus, indeed, who had a trifling epistaxis on the fourth 
<A NAME="247"></A>and fifth day, died. Most of those taken with had a rigor about the time 
<A NAME="248"></A>of the crisis, and notably those who had no hemorrhage; these had also 
<A NAME="249"></A>rigor associated.
<A NAME="250"></A><BR><BR><B>9.</B> Some were attacked with jaundice on the sixth day, but 
<A NAME="251"></A>these were benefited either by an urinary purgation, or a disorder of the 
<A NAME="252"></A>bowels, or a copious hemorrhage, as in the case of Heraclides, who was 
<A NAME="253"></A>lodged with Aristocydes: this person, though he had the hemorrhage from 
<A NAME="254"></A>the nose, the purgation by the bladder, and disorder of the bowels, experienced 
<A NAME="255"></A>a favorable crisis on the twentieth day, not like the servant of Phanagoras, 
<A NAME="256"></A>who had none of these symptoms, and died. The hemorrhages attacked most 
<A NAME="257"></A>persons, but especially young persons and those in the prime of life, and 
<A NAME="258"></A>the greater part of those who had not the hemorrhage died: elderly persons 
<A NAME="259"></A>had jaundice or disorder of the bowels, such as Bion, who was lodged with 
<A NAME="260"></A>Silenus. Dysenteries were epidemical during the summer, and some of those 
<A NAME="261"></A>cases in which the hemorrhage occurred, terminated in dysentery, as happened 
<A NAME="262"></A>to the slave of Eraton, and to Mullus, who had a copious hemorrhage, which 
<A NAME="263"></A>settled down into dysentery, and they recovered. This humor was redundant 
<A NAME="264"></A>in many cases, since in those who had not the hemorrhage about the crisis, 
<A NAME="265"></A>but the risings about the ears disappeared, after their disappearance there 
<A NAME="266"></A>was a sense of weight in the left flank extending to the extremity of the 
<A NAME="267"></A>hip, and pain setting in after the crisis, with a discharge of thin urine; 
<A NAME="268"></A>they began to have small hemorrhages about the twenty-fourth day, and the 
<A NAME="269"></A>swelling was converted into the hemorrhage. In the case of Antiphon, the 
<A NAME="270"></A>son of Critobulus' son, the fever ceased and came to a crisis about the 
<A NAME="271"></A>fortieth day.
<A NAME="272"></A><BR><BR><B>10.</B> Many women were seized, but fewer than of the men, and 
<A NAME="273"></A>there were fewer deaths among them. But most of them had difficult parturition, 
<A NAME="274"></A>and after labor they were taken ill, and these most especially died, as, 
<A NAME="275"></A>for example, the daughter of Telebolus died on the sixth day after delivery. 
<A NAME="276"></A>Most females had the menstrual discharge during the fever, and many girls 
<A NAME="277"></A>had it then for the first time: in certain individuals both the hemorrhage 
<A NAME="278"></A>from the nose and the menses appeared; thus, in the case of the virgin 
<A NAME="279"></A>daughter of Daetharses, the menses then took place for the first time, 
<A NAME="280"></A>and she had also a copinous hemorrhage from the nose, and I knew no instance 
<A NAME="281"></A>of any one dying when one or other of these took place properly. But all 
<A NAME="282"></A>those in the pregnant state that were attacked had abortions, as far as 
<A NAME="283"></A>I observed. The urine in most cases was of the proper color, but thin, 
<A NAME="284"></A>and having scanty sediments: in most the bowels were disordered with thin 
<A NAME="285"></A>and bilious dejections; and many, after passing through the other crises, 
<A NAME="286"></A>terminated in dysenteries, as happened to Xenophanes and Critias. The urine 
<A NAME="287"></A>was watery, copious, clear, and thin; and even after the crises, when the 
<A NAME="288"></A>sediment was natural, and all the other critical symptoms were favorable, 
<A NAME="289"></A>as I recollect having happened to Bion, who was lodged in the house of 
<A NAME="290"></A>Silenus, and Critias, who lived with Xenophanes, the slave of Areton, and 
<A NAME="291"></A>the wife of Mnesistratus. But afterwards all these were attacked with dysentery. 
<A NAME="292"></A>It would be worth while to inquire whether the watery urine was the cause 
<A NAME="293"></A>of this. About the season of Arcturus many had the crisis on the eleventh 
<A NAME="294"></A>day, and in them the regular relapses did not take place, but they became 
<A NAME="295"></A>comatose about this time, especially children; but there were fewest deaths 
<A NAME="296"></A>of all among them.
<A NAME="297"></A><BR><BR><B>11.</B> About the equinox, and until the season of the Pleiades, 
<A NAME="298"></A>and at the approach of winter, many ardent fevers set in; but great numbers 
<A NAME="299"></A>at that season were seized with phrenitis, and many died; a few cases also 
<A NAME="300"></A>occurred during the summer. These then made their attack at the commencement 
<A NAME="301"></A>of ardent fevers, which were attended with fatal symptoms; for immediately 
<A NAME="302"></A>upon their setting in, there were acute fever and small rigors, insomnolency, 
<A NAME="303"></A>aberration, thirst, nausea, insignificant sweats about the forehead and 
<A NAME="304"></A>clavicles, but no general perspiration; they had much delirious talking, 
<A NAME="305"></A>fears, despondency, great coldness of the extremities, in the feet, but 
<A NAME="306"></A>more especially in their hands: the paroxysms were on the even days; and 
<A NAME="307"></A>in most cases, on the fourth day, the most violent pains set in, with sweats, 
<A NAME="308"></A>generally coldish, and the extremities could not be warmed, but were livid 
<A NAME="309"></A>and rather cold, and they had then no thirst; in them the urine was black, 
<A NAME="310"></A>scanty, thin, and the bowels were constipated; there was an hemorrhage 
<A NAME="311"></A>from the nose in no case in which these symptoms occurred, but merely a 
<A NAME="312"></A>trifling epistaxis; and none of them had a relapse, but they died on the 
<A NAME="313"></A>sixth day with sweats. In the phrenitic cases, all the symptoms which have 
<A NAME="314"></A>been described did not occur, but in them the disease mostly came to a 
<A NAME="315"></A>crisis on the eleventh day, and in some on the twentieth. In those cases 
<A NAME="316"></A>in which the phrenitis did not begin immediately, but about the third or 
<A NAME="317"></A>fourth day, the disease was moderate at the commencement, but assumed a 
<A NAME="318"></A>violent character about the seventh day. There was a great number of diseases, 
<A NAME="319"></A>and of those affected, they who died were principally infants, young persons, 
<A NAME="320"></A>adults having smooth bodies, white skins, straight and black hair, dark 
<A NAME="321"></A>eyes, those living recklessly and luxuriously; persons with shrill, or 
<A NAME="322"></A>rough voices, who stammered and were passionate, and women more especially 
<A NAME="323"></A>died from this form. In this constitution, four symptoms in particular 
<A NAME="324"></A>proved salutary; either a hemorrhage from the nose, or a copious discharge 
<A NAME="325"></A>by the bladder of urine, having an abundant and proper sediment, or a bilious 
<A NAME="326"></A>disorder of the bowels at the proper time, or an attack of dysentery. And 
<A NAME="327"></A>in many cases it happened, that the crisis did not take place by any one 
<A NAME="328"></A>of the symptoms which have been mentioned, but the patient passed through 
<A NAME="329"></A>most of them, and appeared to be in an uncomfortable way, and yet all who 
<A NAME="330"></A>were attacked with these symptoms recovered. All the symptoms which I have 
<A NAME="331"></A>described occurred also to women and girls; and whoever of them had any 
<A NAME="332"></A>of these symptoms in a favorable manner, or the menses appeared abundantly, 
<A NAME="333"></A>were saved thereby, and had a crisis, so that I do not know a single female 
<A NAME="334"></A>who had any of these favorably that died. But the daughter of Philo, who 
<A NAME="335"></A>had a copious hemorrhage from the nose, and took supper unseasonably on 
<A NAME="336"></A>the seventh day, died. In those cases of acute, and more especially of 
<A NAME="337"></A>ardent fevers, in which there is an involuntary discharge of tears, you 
<A NAME="338"></A>may expect a nasal hemorrhage unless the other symptoms be of a fatal type, 
<A NAME="339"></A>for in those of a bad description, they do not indicate a hemorrhage, but 
<A NAME="340"></A>death.
<A NAME="341"></A><BR><BR><B>12.</B> Swellings about the ears, with pain in fevers, sometimes 
<A NAME="342"></A>when the fever went off critically, neither subsided nor were converted 
<A NAME="343"></A>into pus; in these cases a bilious diarrhoea, or dysentery, or thick urine 
<A NAME="344"></A>having a sediment, carried off the disease, as happened to Hermippus of 
<A NAME="345"></A>Clazomenae. The circumstances relating to crises, as far as we can recognize 
<A NAME="346"></A>them, were so far similar and so far dissimilar. Thus two brothers became 
<A NAME="347"></A>ill at the same hour (they were brothers of Epigenes, and lodged near the 
<A NAME="348"></A>theatre), of these the elder had a crisis on the sixth day, and the younger 
<A NAME="349"></A>on the seventh, and both had a relapse at the same hour; it then left them 
<A NAME="350"></A>for five days, and from the return of the fever both had a crisis together 
<A NAME="351"></A>on the seventeenth day. Most had a crisis on the sixth day; it then left 
<A NAME="352"></A>them for six days, and from the relapse there was a crisis on the fifth 
<A NAME="353"></A>day. But those who had a crisis on the seventh day, had an intermission 
<A NAME="354"></A>for seven days; and the crisis took place on the third day after the relapse. 
<A NAME="355"></A>Those who had a crisis on the sixth day, after an interval of six days 
<A NAME="356"></A>were seized again on the third, and having left them for one day, the fever 
<A NAME="357"></A>attacked them again on the next and came to a crisis, as happened to Evagon 
<A NAME="358"></A>the son of Daetharses. Those in whom the crisis happened on the sixth day, 
<A NAME="359"></A>had an intermission of seven days, and from the relapse there was a crisis 
<A NAME="360"></A>on the fourth, as happened to the daughter of Aglaidas. The greater part 
<A NAME="361"></A>of those who were taken ill under this constitution of things, were affected 
<A NAME="362"></A>in this manner, and I did not know a single case of recovery, in which 
<A NAME="363"></A>there was not a relapse agreeably to the stated order of relapses; and 
<A NAME="364"></A>all those recovered in which the relapses took place according to this 
<A NAME="365"></A>form: nor did I know a single instance of those who then passed through 
<A NAME="366"></A>the disease in this manner who had another relapse.
<A NAME="367"></A><BR><BR><B>13.</B> In these diseases death generally happened on the sixth 
<A NAME="368"></A>day, as with Epaminondas, Silenus, and Philiscus the son of Antagoras. 
<A NAME="369"></A>Those who had parotid swellings experienced a crisis on the twentieth day, 
<A NAME="370"></A>but in all these cases the disease went off without coming to a suppuration, 
<A NAME="371"></A>and was turned upon the bladder. But in Cratistonax, who lived by the temple 
<A NAME="372"></A>of Hercules, and in the maid servant of Scymnus the fuller, it turned to 
<A NAME="373"></A>a suppuration, and they died. Those who had a crisis on the seventh day, 
<A NAME="374"></A>had an intermission of nine days, and a relapse which came to a crisis 
<A NAME="375"></A>on the fourth day from the return of the fever, as was the case with Pantacles, 
<A NAME="376"></A>who resided close by the temple of Bacchus. Those who had a crisis on the 
<A NAME="377"></A>seventh day, after an interval of six days had a relapse, from which they 
<A NAME="378"></A>had a crisis on the seventh day, as happened to Phanocritus, who was lodged 
<A NAME="379"></A>with Gnathon the fuller. During the winter, about the winter solstices, 
<A NAME="380"></A>and until the equinox, the ardent fevers and frenzies prevailed, and many 
<A NAME="381"></A>died. The crisis, however, changed, and happened to the greater number 
<A NAME="382"></A>on the fifth day from the commencement, left them for four days and relapsed; 
<A NAME="383"></A>and after the return, there was a crisis on the fifth day, making in all 
<A NAME="384"></A>fourteen days. The crisis took place thus in the case of most children, 
<A NAME="385"></A>also in elder persons. Some had a crisis on the eleventh day, a relapse 
<A NAME="386"></A>on the fourteenth, a complete crisis on the twentieth; but certain persons, 
<A NAME="387"></A>who had a rigor about the twentieth, had a crisis on the fortieth. The 
<A NAME="388"></A>greater part had a rigor along with the original crisis, and these had 
<A NAME="389"></A>also a rigor about the crisis in the relapse. There were fewest cases of 
<A NAME="390"></A>rigor in the spring, more in summer, still more in autumn, but by far the 
<A NAME="391"></A>most in winter; then hemorrhages ceased.

<A NAME="392"></A><B>Section III</B>

<A NAME="393"></A><BR><BR><B>1.</B> With regard to diseases, the circumstances from which 
<A NAME="394"></A>we form a judgment of them are,- by attending to the general nature of 
<A NAME="395"></A>all, and the peculiar nature of each individual,- to the disease, the patient, 
<A NAME="396"></A>and the applications,- to the person who applies them, as that makes a 
<A NAME="397"></A>difference for better or for worse,- to the whole constitution of the season, 
<A NAME="398"></A>and particularly to the state of the heavens, and the nature of each country;- 
<A NAME="399"></A>to the patient's habits, regimen, and pursuits;- to his conversation, manners, 
<A NAME="400"></A>taciturnity, thoughts, sleep, or absence of sleep, and sometimes his dreams, 
<A NAME="401"></A>what and when they occur;- to his picking and scratching;- to his tears;- 
<A NAME="402"></A>to the alvine discharges, urine, sputa, and vomitings; and to the changes 
<A NAME="403"></A>of diseases from the one into the other;- to the deposits, whether of a 
<A NAME="404"></A>deadly or critical character;- to the sweat, coldness, rigor, cough, sneezing, 
<A NAME="405"></A>hiccup, respiration, eructation, flatulence, whether passed silently or 
<A NAME="406"></A>with a noise;- to hemorrhages and hemorrhoids;- from these, and their consequences, 
<A NAME="407"></A>we must form our judgment.
<A NAME="408"></A><BR><BR><B>2.</B> Fevers are,- the continual, some of which hold during 
<A NAME="409"></A>the day and have a remission at night, and others hold a remission during 
<A NAME="410"></A>the day; semi-tertians, tertians, quartans, quintans, septans, nonans. 
<A NAME="411"></A>The most acute, strongest, most dangerous, and fatal diseases, occur in 
<A NAME="412"></A>the continual fever. The least dangerous of all, and the mildest and most 
<A NAME="413"></A>protracted, is the quartan, for it is not only such from itself, but it 
<A NAME="414"></A>also carries off other great diseases. In what is called the semi-tertian, 
<A NAME="415"></A>other acute diseases are apt to occur, and it is the most fatal of all 
<A NAME="416"></A>others, and moreover phthisical persons, and those laboring under other 
<A NAME="417"></A>protracted diseases, are apt to be attacked by it. The nocturnal fever 
<A NAME="418"></A>is not very fatal, but protracted; the diurnal is still more protracted, 
<A NAME="419"></A>and in some cases passes into phthisis. The septan is protracted, but not 
<A NAME="420"></A>fatal; the nonan more protracted, and not fatal. The true tertian comes 
<A NAME="421"></A>quickly to a crisis, and is not fatal; but the quintan is the worst of 
<A NAME="422"></A>all, for it proves fatal when it precedes an attack of phthisis, and when 
<A NAME="423"></A>it supervenes on persons who are already consumptive. There are peculiar 
<A NAME="424"></A>modes, and constitutions, and paroxysms, in every one of these fevers; 
<A NAME="425"></A>for example,- the continual, in some cases at the very commencement, grows, 
<A NAME="426"></A>as it were, and attains its full strength, and rises to its most dangerous 
<A NAME="427"></A>pitch, but is diminished about and at the crisis; in others it begins gentle 
<A NAME="428"></A>and suppressed, but gains ground and is exacerbated every day, and bursts 
<A NAME="429"></A>forth with all its heat about and at the crisis; while in others, again, 
<A NAME="430"></A>it commences mildly, increases, and is exacerbated until it reaches its 
<A NAME="431"></A>acme, and then remits until at and about the crisis. These varieties occur 
<A NAME="432"></A>in every fever, and in every disease. From these observations one must 
<A NAME="433"></A>regulate the regimen accordingly. There are many other important symptoms 
<A NAME="434"></A>allied to these, part of which have been already noticed, and part will 
<A NAME="435"></A>be described afterwards, from a consideration of which one may judge, and 
<A NAME="436"></A>decided in each case, whether the disease be acute, acute, and whether 
<A NAME="437"></A>it will end in death or recovery; or whether it will be protracted, and 
<A NAME="438"></A>will end in death or recovery; and in what cases food is to be given, and 
<A NAME="439"></A>in what not; and when and to what amount, and what particular kind of food 
<A NAME="440"></A>is to be administered.
<A NAME="441"></A><BR><BR><B>3.</B> Those diseases which have their paroxysms on even days 
<A NAME="442"></A>have their crises on even days; and those which have their paroxysms on 
<A NAME="443"></A>uneven days have their crises on uneven days. The first period of those 
<A NAME="444"></A>which have the crisis on even days, is the 4th, 6th, 8th, 10th, 14th, 20th, 
<A NAME="445"></A>30th, 40th, 60th, 80th, 100th; and the first period of those which have 
<A NAME="446"></A>their crises on uneven days, is the 1st, 3d, 5th, 7th, 9th, 11th, 17th, 
<A NAME="447"></A>21th, 27th, 31st. It should be known, that if the crisis take place on 
<A NAME="448"></A>any other day than on those described, it indicates that there will be 
<A NAME="449"></A>a relapse, which may prove fatal. But one ought to pay attention, and know 
<A NAME="450"></A>in these seasons what crises will lead to recovery and what to death, or 
<A NAME="451"></A>to changes for the better or the worse. Irregular fevers, quartans, quintans, 
<A NAME="452"></A>septans, and nonans should be studied, in order to find out in what periods 
<A NAME="453"></A>their crises take place.
<A NAME="454"></A><BR><BR><B>Fourteen Cases of Disease</B>
<A NAME="455"></A><BR><BR>Case I. Philiscus, who lived by the Wall, took to bed on the first 
<A NAME="456"></A>day of acute fever; he sweated; towards night was uneasy. On the second 
<A NAME="457"></A>day all the symptoms were exacerbated; late in the evening had a proper 
<A NAME="458"></A>stool from a small clyster; the night quiet. On the third day, early in 
<A NAME="459"></A>the morning and until noon, he appeared to be free from fever; towards 
<A NAME="460"></A>evening, acute fever, with sweating, thirst, tongue parched; passed black 
<A NAME="461"></A>urine; night uncomfortable, no sleep; he was delirious on all subjects. 
<A NAME="462"></A>On the fourth, all the symptoms exacerbated, urine black; night more comfortable, 
<A NAME="463"></A>urine of a better color. On the fifth, about mid-day, had a slight trickling 
<A NAME="464"></A>of pure blood from the nose; urine varied in character, having floating 
<A NAME="465"></A>in it round bodies, resembling semen, and scattered, but which did not 
<A NAME="466"></A>fall to the bottom; a suppository having been applied, some scanty flatulent 
<A NAME="467"></A>matters were passed; night uncomfortable, little sleep, talking incoherently; 
<A NAME="468"></A>extremities altogether cold, and could not be warmed; urine, black; slept 
<A NAME="469"></A>a little towards day; loss of speech, cold sweats; extremities livid; about 
<A NAME="470"></A>the middle of the sixth day he died. The respiration throughout, like that 
<A NAME="471"></A>of a person recollecting himself, was rare, and large, and spleen was swelled 
<A NAME="472"></A>upon in a round tumor, the sweats cold throughout, the paroxysms on the 
<A NAME="473"></A>even days.
<A NAME="474"></A><BR><BR>Case i. Silenus lived on the Broad-way, near the house of Evalcidas. 
<A NAME="475"></A>From fatigue, drinking, and unseasonable exercises, he was seized with 
<A NAME="476"></A>fever. He began with having pain in the loins; he had heaviness of the 
<A NAME="477"></A>head, and there was stiffness of the neck. On the first day the alvine 
<A NAME="478"></A>discharges were bilious, unmixed, frothy, high colored, and copious; urine 
<A NAME="479"></A>black, having a black sediment; he was thirsty, tongue dry; no sleep at 
<A NAME="480"></A>night. On the second, acute fever, stools more copious, thinner, frothy; 
<A NAME="481"></A>urine black, an uncomfortable night, slight delirium. On the third, all 
<A NAME="482"></A>the symptoms exacerbated; an oblong distention, of a softish nature, from 
<A NAME="483"></A>both sides of the hypochondrium to the navel; stools thin, and darkish; 
<A NAME="484"></A>urine muddy, and darkish; no sleep at night; much talking, laughter, singing, 
<A NAME="485"></A>he could not restrain himself. On the fourth, in the same state. On the 
<A NAME="486"></A>fifth, stools bilious, unmixed, smooth, greasy; urine thin, and transparent; 
<A NAME="487"></A>slight absence of delirium. On the sixth, slight perspiration about the 
<A NAME="488"></A>head; extremities cold and livid; much tossing about; no passage from the 
<A NAME="489"></A>bowels, urine suppressed, acute fever. On the seventh, loss of speech; 
<A NAME="490"></A>extremities could no longer be kept warm; no discharge of urine. On the 
<A NAME="491"></A>eighth, a cold sweat all over; red rashes with sweat, of a round figure, 
<A NAME="492"></A>small, like vari, persistent, not subsiding; by means of a slight stimulus, 
<A NAME="493"></A>a copious discharge from the bowels, of a thin and undigested character, 
<A NAME="494"></A>with pain; urine acrid, and passed with pain; extremities slightly heated; 
<A NAME="495"></A>sleep slight, and comatose; speechless; urine thin, and transparent. On 
<A NAME="496"></A>the ninth, in the same state. On the tenth, no drink taken; comatose, sleep 
<A NAME="497"></A>slight; alvine discharges the same; urine abundant, and thickish; when 
<A NAME="498"></A>allowed to stand, the sediment farinaceous and white; extremities again 
<A NAME="499"></A>cold. On the eleventh, he died. At the commencement, and throughout, the 
<A NAME="500"></A>respiration was slow and large; there was a constant throbbing in the hypochondrium; 
<A NAME="501"></A>his age was about twenty.
<A NAME="502"></A><BR><BR>Case ii. Herophon was seized with an acute fever; alvine discharges 
<A NAME="503"></A>at first were scanty, and attended with tenesmus; but afterwards they were 
<A NAME="504"></A>passed of a thin, bilious character, and frequent; there was no sleep; 
<A NAME="505"></A>urine black, and thin. On the fifth, in the morning, deafness; all the 
<A NAME="506"></A>symptoms exacerbated; spleen swollen; distention of the hypochondrium; 
<A NAME="507"></A>alvine discharges scanty, and black; he became delirious. On the sixth, 
<A NAME="508"></A>delirious; at night, sweating, coldness; the delirium continued. On the 
<A NAME="509"></A>seventh, he became cold, thirsty, was disordered in mind; at night recovered 
<A NAME="510"></A>his senses; slept. On the eighth, was feverish; the spleen diminished in 
<A NAME="511"></A>size; quite collected; had pain at first about the groin, on the same side 
<A NAME="512"></A>as the spleen; had pains in both legs; night comfortable; urine better
