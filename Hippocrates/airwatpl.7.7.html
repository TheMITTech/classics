<A NAME="10"></A>And I wish to give an account of the other kinds of waters, namely, of 
<A NAME="11"></A>such as are wholesome and such as are unwholesome, and what bad and what 
<A NAME="12"></A>good effects may be derived from water; for water contributes much towards 
<A NAME="13"></A>health. Such waters then as are marshy, stagnant, and belong to lakes, 
<A NAME="14"></A>are necessarily hot in summer, thick, and have a strong smell, since they 
<A NAME="15"></A>have no current; but being constantly supplied by rain-water, and the sun 
<A NAME="16"></A>heating them, they necessarily want their proper color, are unwholesome 
<A NAME="17"></A>and form bile; in winter, they become congealed, cold, and muddy with the 
<A NAME="18"></A>snow and ice, so that they are most apt to engender phlegm, and bring on 
<A NAME="19"></A>hoarseness; those who drink them have large and obstructed spleens, their 
<A NAME="20"></A>bellies are hard, emaciated, and hot; and their shoulders, collar-bones, 
<A NAME="21"></A>and faces are emaciated; for their flesh is melted down and taken up by 
<A NAME="22"></A>the spleen, and hence they are slender; such persons then are voracious 
<A NAME="23"></A>and thirsty; their bellies are very dry both above and below, so that they 
<A NAME="24"></A>require the strongest medicines. This disease is habitual to them both 
<A NAME="25"></A>in summer and in winter, and in addition they are very subject to dropsies 
<A NAME="26"></A>of a most fatal character; and in summer dysenteries, diarrheas, and protracted 
<A NAME="27"></A>quartan fevers frequently seize them, and these diseases when prolonged 
<A NAME="28"></A>dispose such constitutions to dropsies, and thus prove fatal. These are 
<A NAME="29"></A>the diseases which attack them in summer; but in winter younger persons 
<A NAME="30"></A>are liable to pneumonia, and maniacal affections; and older persons to 
<A NAME="31"></A>ardent fevers, from hardness of the belly. Women are subject to oedema 
<A NAME="32"></A>and leucophlegmasiae; when pregnant they have difficult deliveries; their 
<A NAME="33"></A>infants are large and swelled, and then during nursing they become wasted 
<A NAME="34"></A>and sickly, and the lochial discharge after parturition does not proceed 
<A NAME="35"></A>properly with the women. The children are particularly subject to hernia, 
<A NAME="36"></A>and adults to varices and ulcers on their legs, so that persons with such 
<A NAME="37"></A>constitutions cannot be long-lived, but before the usual period they fall 
<A NAME="38"></A>into a state of premature old age. And further, the women appear to be 
<A NAME="39"></A>with child, and when the time of parturition arrives, the fulness of the 
<A NAME="40"></A>belly disappears, and this happens from dropsy of the uterus. Such waters 
<A NAME="41"></A>then I reckon bad for every purpose. The next to them in badness are those 
<A NAME="42"></A>which have their fountains in rocks, so that they must necessarily be hard, 
<A NAME="43"></A>or come from a soil which produces thermal waters, such as those having 
<A NAME="44"></A>iron, copper, silver, gold, sulphur, alum, bitumen, or nitre (soda) in 
<A NAME="45"></A>them; for all these are formed by the force of heat. Good waters cannot 
<A NAME="46"></A>proceed from such a soil, but those that are hard and of a heating nature, 
<A NAME="47"></A>difficult to pass by urine, and of difficult evacuation by the bowels. 
<A NAME="48"></A>The best are those which flow from elevated grounds, and hills of earth; 
<A NAME="49"></A>these are sweet, clear, and can bear a little wine; they are hot in summer 
<A NAME="50"></A>and cold in winter, for such necessarily must be the waters from deep wells. 
<A NAME="51"></A>But those are most to be commended which run to the rising of the sun, 
<A NAME="52"></A>and especially to the summer sun; for such are necessarily more clear, 
<A NAME="53"></A>fragrant, and light. But all such as are salty, crude, and harsh, are not 
<A NAME="54"></A>good for drink. But there are certain constitutions and diseases with which 
<A NAME="55"></A>such waters agree when drunk, as I will explain presently. Their characters 
<A NAME="56"></A>are as follows: the best are such as have their fountains to the east; 
<A NAME="57"></A>the next, those between the summer risings and settings of the sun, and 
<A NAME="58"></A>especially those to the risings; and third, those between the summer and 
<A NAME="59"></A>winter settings; but the worst are those to the south, and the parts between 
<A NAME="60"></A>the winter rising and setting, and those to the south are very bad, but 
<A NAME="61"></A>those to the north are better. They are to be used as follows: whoever 
<A NAME="62"></A>is in good health and strength need not mind, but may always drink whatever 
<A NAME="63"></A>is at hand. But whoever wishes to drink the most suitable for any disease, 
<A NAME="64"></A>may accomplish his purpose by attending to the following directions: To 
<A NAME="65"></A>persons whose bellies are hard and easily burnt up, the sweetest, the lightest, 
<A NAME="66"></A>and the most limpid waters will be proper; but those persons whose bellies 
<A NAME="67"></A>are soft, loose, and pituitous, should choose the hardest, those kinds 
<A NAME="68"></A>that are most crude, and the saltiest, for thus will they be most readily 
<A NAME="69"></A>dried up; for such waters as are adapted for boiling, and are of a very 
<A NAME="70"></A>solvent nature, naturally loosen readily and melt down the bowels; but 
<A NAME="71"></A>such as are intractable, hard, and by no means proper for boiling, these 
<A NAME="72"></A>rather bind and dry up the bowels. People have deceived themselves with 
<A NAME="73"></A>regard to salt waters, from inexperience, for they think these waters purgative, 
<A NAME="74"></A>whereas they are the very reverse; for such waters are crude, and ill adapted 
<A NAME="75"></A>for boiling, so that the belly is more likely to be bound up than loosened 
<A NAME="76"></A>by them. And thus it is with regard to the waters of 
<A NAME="77"></A>springs.
