<A NAME="start"></A>
<A NAME="10"></A>Let us here briefly advert to what may be said on the opposite side; namely, 
<A NAME="11"></A>that a change of diet has occurred in these cases, without any change in 
<A NAME="12"></A>their body, either as to strength, so as to require an increase of food, 
<A NAME="13"></A>or as to weakness, so as to require a diminution. But the strength of the 
<A NAME="14"></A>patient is to be taken into consideration, and the manner of the disease, 
<A NAME="15"></A>and of the constitution of the man, and the habitual regimen of the patient, 
<A NAME="16"></A>not only as regards food but also drink. Yet one must much less resort 
<A NAME="17"></A>to augmentation, since it is often beneficial to have recourse to abstraction, 
<A NAME="18"></A>when the patient can bear it, until the disease having reached its acme 
<A NAME="19"></A>and has become concocted. But in what cases this must be done will be afterwards 
<A NAME="20"></A>described. One might write many other things akin to those which have been 
<A NAME="21"></A>now said, but there is a better proof, for it is not akin to the matter 
<A NAME="22"></A>on which my discourse has principally turned, but the subject-matter itself 
<A NAME="23"></A>is a most seasonable proof. For some at the commencement of acute diseases 
<A NAME="24"></A>have taken food on the same day, some on the next day; some have swallowed 
<A NAME="25"></A>whatever has come in their way, and some have taken cyceon. Now all these 
<A NAME="26"></A>things are worse than if one had observed a different regimen; and yet 
<A NAME="27"></A>these mistakes, committed at that time, do much less injury than if one 
<A NAME="28"></A>were to abstain entirely from food for the first two or three days, and 
<A NAME="29"></A>on the fourth or fifth day were to take such food; and it would be still 
<A NAME="30"></A>worse, if one were to observe total abstinence for all these days, and 
<A NAME="31"></A>on the following days were to take such a diet, before the disease is concocted; 
<A NAME="32"></A>for in this way death would be the consequence to most people, unless the 
<A NAME="33"></A>disease were of a very mild nature. But the mistakes committed at first 
<A NAME="34"></A>were not so irremediable as these, but could be much more easily repaired. 
<A NAME="35"></A>This, therefore, I think a strong proof that such or such a draught need 
<A NAME="36"></A>not be prescribed on the first days to those who will use the same draughts 
<A NAME="37"></A>afterwards. At the bottom, therefore, they do not know, neither those using 
<A NAME="38"></A>unstrained ptisans, that they are hurt by them, when they begin to swallow 
<A NAME="39"></A>them, if they abstain entirely from food for two, three, or more days; 
<A NAME="40"></A>nor do those using the juice know that they are injured in swallowing them, 
<A NAME="41"></A>when they do not commence with the draught seasonably. But this they guard 
<A NAME="42"></A>against, and know that it does much mischief, if, before the disease be 
<A NAME="43"></A>concocted, the patient swallow unstrained ptisan, when accustomed to use 
<A NAME="44"></A>strained. All these things are strong proofs that physicians do not conduct 
<A NAME="45"></A>the regimen of patients properly, but that in those diseases in which total 
<A NAME="46"></A>abstinence from food should not be enforced on patients that will be put 
<A NAME="47"></A>on the use of ptisans, they do enforce total abstinence; that in those 
<A NAME="48"></A>cases in which there should be no change made from total abstinence to 
<A NAME="49"></A>ptisans, they do make the change; and that, for the most part, they change 
<A NAME="50"></A>from abstinence to ptisans, exactly at the time when it is often beneficial 
<A NAME="51"></A>to proceed from ptisans almost to total abstinence, if the disease happen 
<A NAME="52"></A>to be in the state of exacerbation. And sometimes crude matters are attracted 
<A NAME="53"></A>from the head, and bilious from the region near the chest, and the patients 
<A NAME="54"></A>are attacked with insomnolency, so that the disease is not concocted; they 
<A NAME="55"></A>become sorrowful, peevish, and delirious; there are flashes of light in 
<A NAME="56"></A>their eyes, and noises in their ears; their extremities are cold, their 
<A NAME="57"></A>urine unconcocted; the sputa thin, saltish, tinged with an intense color 
<A NAME="58"></A>and smell; sweats about the neck, and anxiety; respiration, interrupted 
<A NAME="59"></A>in the expulsion of the air, frequent and very large; expression of the 
<A NAME="60"></A>eyelids dreadful; dangerous deliquia; tossing of the bed-clothes from the 
<A NAME="61"></A>breast; the hands trembling, and sometimes the lower lip agitated. These 
<A NAME="62"></A>symptoms, appearing at the commencement, are indicative of strong delirium, 
<A NAME="63"></A>and patients so affected generally die, or if they escape, it is with a 
<A NAME="64"></A>deposit, hemorrhage from the nose, or the expectoration of thick matter, 
<A NAME="65"></A>and not otherwise. Neither do I perceive that physicians are skilled in 
<A NAME="66"></A>such things as these; how they ought to know such diseases as are connected 
<A NAME="67"></A>with debility, and which are further weakened by abstinence from food, 
<A NAME="68"></A>and those aggravated by some other irritation; those by pain, and from 
<A NAME="69"></A>the acute nature of the disease, and what affections and various forms 
<A NAME="70"></A>thereof our constitution and habit engender, although the knowledge or 
<A NAME="71"></A>ignorance of such things brings safety or death to the patient. For it 
<A NAME="72"></A>is a great mischief if to a patient debilitated by pain, and the acute 
<A NAME="73"></A>nature of the disease, one administer drink, or more ptisan, or food, supposing 
<A NAME="74"></A>that the debility proceeds from inanition. It is also disgraceful not to 
<A NAME="75"></A>recognize a patient whose debility is connected with inanition, and to 
<A NAME="76"></A>pinch him in his diet; this mistake, indeed, is attended with some danger, 
<A NAME="77"></A>but much less than the other, and yet it is likely to expose one to much 
<A NAME="78"></A>greater derision, for if another physician, or a private person, coming 
<A NAME="79"></A>in and knowing what has happened, should give to eat or drink those things 
<A NAME="80"></A>which the other had forbidden, the benefit thus done to the patient would 
<A NAME="81"></A>be manifest. Such mistakes of practitioners are particularly ridiculed 
<A NAME="82"></A>by mankind, for the physician or nonprofessional man thus coming in, seems 
<A NAME="83"></A>as it were to resuscitate the dead. On this subject I will describe elsewhere 
<A NAME="84"></A>the symptoms by which each of them may be recognized.
