The Oath
By Hippocrates


Translated by Francis Adams

I SWEAR by Apollo the physician, and Aesculapius, and Health, and
All-heal, and all the gods and goddesses, that, according to my ability
and judgment, I will keep this Oath and this stipulation- to reckon
him who taught me this Art equally dear to me as my parents, to share
my substance with him, and relieve his necessities if required; to
look upon his offspring in the same footing as my own brothers, and
to teach them this art, if they shall wish to learn it, without fee
or stipulation; and that by precept, lecture, and every other mode
of instruction, I will impart a knowledge of the Art to my own sons,
and those of my teachers, and to disciples bound by a stipulation
and oath according to the law of medicine, but to none others. I will
follow that system of regimen which, according to my ability and judgment,
I consider for the benefit of my patients, and abstain from whatever
is deleterious and mischievous. I will give no deadly medicine to
any one if asked, nor suggest any such counsel; and in like manner
I will not give to a woman a pessary to produce abortion. With purity
and with holiness I will pass my life and practice my Art. I will
not cut persons laboring under the stone, but will leave this to be
done by men who are practitioners of this work. Into whatever houses
I enter, I will go into them for the benefit of the sick, and will
abstain from every voluntary act of mischief and corruption; and,
further from the seduction of females or males, of freemen and slaves.
Whatever, in connection with my professional practice or not, in connection
with it, I see or hear, in the life of men, which ought not to be
spoken of abroad, I will not divulge, as reckoning that all such should
be kept secret. While I continue to keep this Oath unviolated, may
it be granted to me to enjoy life and the practice of the art, respected
by all men, in all times! But should I trespass and violate this Oath,
may the reverse be my lot! 

THE END
