<A NAME="start"></A>
<A NAME="10"></A>When a fractured clavicle is fairly broken across it is more easily treated, 
<A NAME="11"></A>but when broken obliquely it is more difficult to manage. Matters are different 
<A NAME="12"></A>in these cases from what one would have supposed; for a bone fairly broken 
<A NAME="13"></A>across can be more easily restored to its natural state, and with proper 
<A NAME="14"></A>care the upper part may be brought down by means of suitable position and 
<A NAME="15"></A>proper bandaging, and even if not properly set, the projecting part of 
<A NAME="16"></A>the bone is not very sharp. But in oblique fractures the case is similar 
<A NAME="17"></A>to that of bones which have been torn away, as formerly described; for 
<A NAME="18"></A>they do not admit of being restored to their place, and the prominence 
<A NAME="19"></A>of the bone is very sharp. For the most part, then, it should be known, 
<A NAME="20"></A>no harm results to the shoulder or to the rest of the body from fracture 
<A NAME="21"></A>of the clavicle, unless it sphacelate, and this rarely happens. A deformity, 
<A NAME="22"></A>however, may arise from fracture of the clavicle, and in these cases it 
<A NAME="23"></A>is very great at first, but by and by it becomes less. A fractured clavicle, 
<A NAME="24"></A>like all other spongy bones, gets speedily united; for all such bones form 
<A NAME="25"></A>callus in a short time. When, then, a fracture has recently taken place, 
<A NAME="26"></A>the patients attach much importance to it, as supposing the mischief greater 
<A NAME="27"></A>than it really is, and the physicians bestow great pains in order that 
<A NAME="28"></A>it may be properly bandaged; but in a little time the patients, having 
<A NAME="29"></A>no pain, nor finding any impediment to their walking or eating, become 
<A NAME="30"></A>negligent; and the physicians finding they cannot make the parts look well, 
<A NAME="31"></A>take themselves off, and are not sorry at the neglect of the patients, 
<A NAME="32"></A>and in the meantime the callus is quickly formed. The method of dressing 
<A NAME="33"></A>which is most appropriate, is similar to that used in ordinary cases, consisting 
<A NAME="34"></A>of cerate, compresses, and bandages; and it should be most especially known 
<A NAME="35"></A>in this operation, that most compresses should be placed on the projecting 
<A NAME="36"></A>bone, and that the greatest pressure should be made there. There are certain 
<A NAME="37"></A>physicians who make a show of superior skill by binding a heavy piece of 
<A NAME="38"></A>lead on the part in order to depress the projecting bone; but this mode 
<A NAME="39"></A>of treatment does not apply to the clavicle, for it is impossible to depress 
<A NAME="40"></A>the projecting part to any extent worth mentioning. There are others who, 
<A NAME="41"></A>knowing the fact that the bandages are apt to slip off, and that they do 
<A NAME="42"></A>not keep the projecting parts in their place, apply compresses and bandages 
<A NAME="43"></A>like the others, and then having girt the patient with a girdle, where 
<A NAME="44"></A>it is usually applied with most effect, they make a heap of the compresses 
<A NAME="45"></A>upon of the compresses upon the projecting bone when they apply them, and 
<A NAME="46"></A>having fastened the head of the bandage to the girdle in front, they apply 
<A NAME="47"></A>it so as to bring the turns of it into the line of the clavicle, carrying 
<A NAME="48"></A>them to the back, and then bringing them around the girdle they carry them 
<A NAME="49"></A>to the fore part and again backward. There are others who do not apply 
<A NAME="50"></A>the bandage round the girdle, but carry the rounds of it by the perineum 
<A NAME="51"></A>and anus, and along the spine, so as to compress the fracture. To an inexperienced 
<A NAME="52"></A>person these methods will appear not far from natural, but when tied, they 
<A NAME="53"></A>will be found of no service; for they do not remain firm any length of 
<A NAME="54"></A>time, even if the patient keep his bed, although in this position they 
<A NAME="55"></A>answer best; and yet even when lying in bed, should he bend his leg, or 
<A NAME="56"></A>should his trunk be bent, all the will be displaced; and, moreover, the 
<A NAME="57"></A>bandaging is inconvenient, in as much as the anus is comprehended by it, 
<A NAME="58"></A>and many turns of the bandage are crowded there in a narrow space. And 
<A NAME="59"></A>in the method with the girdle, the girdle cannot be so firmly girt around, 
<A NAME="60"></A>but that the turns of the bandage force the girdle to ascend, and hence 
<A NAME="61"></A>of necessity all the other bandages must be slackened. He would seem to 
<A NAME="62"></A>me to come nearest his purpose, although after all he effects but little, 
<A NAME="63"></A>who would take a few turns round the girdle, few turns round the girdle, 
<A NAME="64"></A>but would use the bandage principally to secure the former bandaging; for 
<A NAME="65"></A>in this manner the bandages would be most secure, and would mutually assist 
<A NAME="66"></A>one another. Every thing now almost has been said which applies to fracture 
<A NAME="67"></A>of the clavicle. But this also should be known, that in fractures of the 
<A NAME="68"></A>clavicle, it is the part attached to the breast which is uppermost, and 
<A NAME="69"></A>that the piece attached to the acromion is the lowermost. The cause of 
<A NAME="70"></A>this is, that for the most part the breast can neither be depressed nor 
<A NAME="71"></A>raised, there being but a slight movement of the joint at the breast, for 
<A NAME="72"></A>the sternum is connected together on both sides with the spine. The clavicle 
<A NAME="73"></A>admits of most motion at the joint of the shoulder, and this arises from 
<A NAME="74"></A>its connection with the acromion. And, moreover, when broken, the part 
<A NAME="75"></A>which is connected with the sternum flies upward, and is not easily forced 
<A NAME="76"></A>downward; for it is naturally light, and there is more room for it above 
<A NAME="77"></A>than below. But the shoulder, the arm, and the parts connected with them, 
<A NAME="78"></A>are easily moved from the sides and breast, and, on that account, they 
<A NAME="79"></A>admit of being considerably elevated and depressed. When, therefore, the 
<A NAME="80"></A>clavicle is broken, the fragment attached to the shoulder inclines downward, 
<A NAME="81"></A>for it inclines much more readily with the shoulder and arm downward than 
<A NAME="82"></A>upward. Matters being as I have stated, they act imprudently who think 
<A NAME="83"></A>to depress the projecting end of the bone. But it is clear that the under 
<A NAME="84"></A>part ought to be brought to the upper, for the former is the movable part, 
<A NAME="85"></A>and that which has been displaced from its natural position. It is obvious, 
<A NAME="86"></A>therefore, that there is no other way of applying force to it (for the 
<A NAME="87"></A>bandages no more force it to than they force it from); but if one will 
<A NAME="88"></A>push the arm when at the sides as much as possible upward, so that the 
<A NAME="89"></A>shoulder may appear as sharp as possible, it is clear that in this way 
<A NAME="90"></A>it will be adjusted to the fragment of the bone connected with the breast 
<A NAME="91"></A>from which it was torn. If one then will apply a bandage, secundum artem, 
<A NAME="92"></A>for the purpose of promoting a speedy cure, and will reckon everything 
<A NAME="93"></A>else of no value, except the position as described, he will form a correct 
<A NAME="94"></A>opinion of the case, and will effect a cure in the speediest and most appropriate 
<A NAME="95"></A>manner. It is of great importance, however, that the patient should lie 
<A NAME="96"></A>in a recumbent posture. Fourteen days will be sufficient if he keep quiet, 
<A NAME="97"></A>and twenty at most.
