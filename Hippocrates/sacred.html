<BR><A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A>It is thus with regard to the disease called Sacred: it appears to me to 
<A NAME="11"></A>be nowise more divine nor more sacred than other diseases, but has a natural 
<A NAME="12"></A>cause from the originates like other affections. Men regard its nature 
<A NAME="13"></A>and cause as divine from ignorance and wonder, because it is not at all 
<A NAME="14"></A>like to other diseases. And this notion of its divinity is kept up by their 
<A NAME="15"></A>inability to comprehend it, and the simplicity of the mode by which it 
<A NAME="16"></A>is cured, for men are freed from it by purifications and incantations. 
<A NAME="17"></A>But if it is reckoned divine because it is wonderful, instead of one there 
<A NAME="18"></A>are many diseases which would be sacred; for, as I will show, there are 
<A NAME="19"></A>others no less wonderful and prodigious, which nobody imagines to be sacred. 
<A NAME="20"></A>The quotidian, tertian, and quartan fevers, seem to me no less sacred and 
<A NAME="21"></A>divine in their origin than this disease, although they are not reckoned 
<A NAME="22"></A>so wonderful. And I see men become mad and demented from no manifest cause, 
<A NAME="23"></A>and at the same time doing many things out of place; and I have known many 
<A NAME="24"></A>persons in sleep groaning and crying out, some in a state of suffocation, 
<A NAME="25"></A>some jumping up and fleeing out of doors, and deprived of their reason 
<A NAME="26"></A>until they awaken, and afterward becoming well and rational as before, 
<A NAME="27"></A>although they be pale and weak; and this will happen not once but frequently. 
<A NAME="28"></A>And there are many and various things of the like kind, which it would 
<A NAME="29"></A>be tedious to state particularly.
<A NAME="30"></A><BR><BR>They who first referred this malady to the gods appear to me to 
<A NAME="31"></A>have been just such persons as the conjurors, purificators, mountebanks, 
<A NAME="32"></A>and charlatans now are, who give themselves out for being excessively religious, 
<A NAME="33"></A>and as knowing more than other people. Such persons, then, using the divinity 
<A NAME="34"></A>as a pretext and screen of their own inability to of their own inability 
<A NAME="35"></A>to afford any assistance, have given out that the disease is sacred, adding 
<A NAME="36"></A>suitable reasons for this opinion, they have instituted a mode of treatment 
<A NAME="37"></A>which is safe for themselves, namely, by applying purifications and incantations, 
<A NAME="38"></A>and enforcing abstinence from baths and many articles of food which are 
<A NAME="39"></A>unwholesome to men in diseases. Of sea substances, the surmullet, the blacktail, 
<A NAME="40"></A>the mullet, and the eel; for these are the fishes most to be guarded against. 
<A NAME="41"></A>And of fleshes, those of the goat, the stag, the sow, and the dog: for 
<A NAME="42"></A>these are the kinds of flesh which are aptest to disorder the bowels. Of 
<A NAME="43"></A>fowls, the cock, the turtle, and the bustard, and such others as are reckoned 
<A NAME="44"></A>to be particularly strong. And of potherbs, mint, garlic, and onions; for 
<A NAME="45"></A>what is acrid does not agree with a weak person. And they forbid to have 
<A NAME="46"></A>a black robe, because black is expressive of death; and to sleep on a goat's 
<A NAME="47"></A>skin, or to wear it, and to put one foot upon another, or one hand upon 
<A NAME="48"></A>another; for all these things are held to be hindrances to the cure. All 
<A NAME="49"></A>these they enjoin with reference to its divinity, as if possessed of more 
<A NAME="50"></A>knowledge, and announcing beforehand other causes so that if the person 
<A NAME="51"></A>should recover, theirs would be the honor and credit; and if he should 
<A NAME="52"></A>die, they would have a certain defense, as if the gods, and not they, were 
<A NAME="53"></A>to blame, seeing they had administered nothing either to eat or drink as 
<A NAME="54"></A>medicines, nor had overheated him with baths, so as to prove the cause 
<A NAME="55"></A>of what had happened. But I am of opinion that (if this were true) none 
<A NAME="56"></A>of the Libyans, who live in the interior, would be free from this disease, 
<A NAME="57"></A>since they all sleep on goats' skins, and live upon goats' flesh; neither 
<A NAME="58"></A>have they couch, robe, nor shoe that is not made of goat's skin, for they 
<A NAME="59"></A>have no other herds but goats and oxen. But if these things, when administered 
<A NAME="60"></A>in food, aggravate the disease, and if it be cured by abstinence from them, 
<A NAME="61"></A>godhead is not the cause at all; nor will purifications be of any avail, 
<A NAME="62"></A>but it is the food which is beneficial and prejudicial, and the influence 
<A NAME="63"></A>of the divinity vanishes.
<A NAME="64"></A><BR><BR>Thus, they who try to cure these maladies in this way, appear to 
<A NAME="65"></A>me neither to reckon them sacred nor divine. For when they are removed 
<A NAME="66"></A>by such purifications, and this method of cure, what is to prevent them 
<A NAME="67"></A>from being brought upon men and induced by other devices similar to these? 
<A NAME="68"></A>So that the cause is no longer divine, but human. For whoever is able, 
<A NAME="69"></A>by purifications conjurations, to drive away such an affection, will be 
<A NAME="70"></A>able, by other practices, to excite it; and, according to this view, its 
<A NAME="71"></A>divine nature is entirely done away with. By such sayings and doings, they 
<A NAME="72"></A>profess to be possessed of superior knowledge, and deceive mankind by enjoining 
<A NAME="73"></A>lustrations and purifications upon them, while their discourse turns upon 
<A NAME="74"></A>the divinity and the godhead. And yet it would appear to me that their 
<A NAME="75"></A>discourse savors not of piety, as they suppose, but rather of impiety, 
<A NAME="76"></A>and as if there were no gods, and that what they hold to be holy and divine, 
<A NAME="77"></A>were impious and unholy. This I will now explain.
<A NAME="78"></A><BR><BR>For, if they profess to know how to bring down the moon, darken 
<A NAME="79"></A>the sun, induce storms and fine weather, and rains and droughts, and make 
<A NAME="80"></A>the sea and land unproductive, and so forth, whether they arrogate this 
<A NAME="81"></A>power as being derived from mysteries or any other knowledge or consideration, 
<A NAME="82"></A>they appear to me to practice impiety, and either to fancy that there are 
<A NAME="83"></A>no gods, or, if there are, that they have no ability to ward off any of 
<A NAME="84"></A>the greatest evils. How, then, are they not enemies to the gods? For if 
<A NAME="85"></A>a man by magical arts and sacrifices will bring down the moon, and darken 
<A NAME="86"></A>the sun, and induce storms, or fine weather, I should not believe that 
<A NAME="87"></A>there was anything divine, but human, in these things, provided the power 
<A NAME="88"></A>of the divine were overpowered by human knowledge and subjected to it. 
<A NAME="89"></A>But perhaps it will be said, these things are not so, but, not withstanding, 
<A NAME="90"></A>men being in want of the means of life, invent many and various things, 
<A NAME="91"></A>and devise many contrivances for all other things, and for this disease, 
<A NAME="92"></A>in every phase of the disease, assigning the cause to a god. Nor do they 
<A NAME="93"></A>remember the same things once, but frequently. For, if they imitate a goat, 
<A NAME="94"></A>or grind their teeth, or if their right side be convulsed, they say that 
<A NAME="95"></A>the mother of the gods is the cause. But if they speak in a sharper and 
<A NAME="96"></A>more intense tone, they resemble this state to a horse, and say that Poseidon 
<A NAME="97"></A>is the cause. Or if any excrement be passed, which is often the case, owing 
<A NAME="98"></A>to the violence of the disease, the appellation of Enodia is adhibited; 
<A NAME="99"></A>or, if it be passed in smaller and denser masses, like bird's, it is said 
<A NAME="100"></A>to be from Apollo Nomius. But if foam be emitted by the mouth, and the 
<A NAME="101"></A>patient kick with his feet, Ares then gets the blame. But terrors which 
<A NAME="102"></A>happen during the night, and fevers, and delirium, and jumpings out of 
<A NAME="103"></A>bed, and frightful apparitions, and fleeing away,-all these they hold to 
<A NAME="104"></A>be the plots of Hecate, and the invasions the and use purifications and 
<A NAME="105"></A>incantations, and, as appears to me, make the divinity to be most wicked 
<A NAME="106"></A>and most impious. For they purify those laboring under this disease, with 
<A NAME="107"></A>the same sorts of blood and the other means that are used in the case of 
<A NAME="108"></A>those who are stained with crimes, and of malefactors, or who have been 
<A NAME="109"></A>enchanted by men, or who have done any wicked act; who ought to do the 
<A NAME="110"></A>very reverse, namely, sacrifice and pray, and, bringing gifts to the temples, 
<A NAME="111"></A>supplicate the gods. But now they do none of these things, but purify; 
<A NAME="112"></A>and some of the purifications they conceal in the earth, and some they 
<A NAME="113"></A>throw into the sea, and some they carry to the mountains where no one can 
<A NAME="114"></A>touch or tread upon them. But these they ought to take to the temples and 
<A NAME="115"></A>present to the god, if a god be the cause of the disease. Neither truly 
<A NAME="116"></A>do I count it a worthy opinion to hold that the body of man is polluted 
<A NAME="117"></A>by god, the most impure by the most holy; for were it defiled, or did it 
<A NAME="118"></A>suffer from any other thing, it would be like to be purified and sanctified 
<A NAME="119"></A>rather than polluted by god. For it is the divinity which purifies and 
<A NAME="120"></A>sanctifies the greatest of offenses and the most wicked, and which proves 
<A NAME="121"></A>our protection from them. And we mark out the boundaries of the temples 
<A NAME="122"></A>and the groves of the gods, so that no one may pass them unless he be pure, 
<A NAME="123"></A>and when we enter them we are sprinkled with holy water, not as being polluted, 
<A NAME="124"></A>but as laying aside any other pollution which we formerly had. And thus 
<A NAME="125"></A>it appears to me to hold, with regard to purifications.
<A NAME="126"></A><BR><BR>But this disease seems to me to be no more divine than others; 
<A NAME="127"></A>but it has its nature such as other diseases have, and a cause whence it 
<A NAME="128"></A>originates, and its nature and cause are divine only just as much as all 
<A NAME="129"></A>others are, and it is curable no less than the others, unless when, the 
<A NAME="130"></A>from of time, it is confirmed, and has became stronger than the remedies 
<A NAME="131"></A>applied. Its origin is hereditary, like that of other diseases. For if 
<A NAME="132"></A>a phlegmatic person be born of a phlegmatic, and a bilious of a bilious, 
<A NAME="133"></A>and a phthisical of a phthisical, and one having spleen disease, of another 
<A NAME="134"></A>having disease of the spleen, what is to hinder it from happening that 
<A NAME="135"></A>where the father and mother were subject to this disease, certain of their 
<A NAME="136"></A>offspring should be so affected also? As the semen comes from all parts 
<A NAME="137"></A>of the body, healthy particles will come from healthy parts, and unhealthy 
<A NAME="138"></A>from unhealthy parts. And another great proof that it is in nothing more 
<A NAME="139"></A>divine than other diseases is, that it occurs in those who are of a phlegmatic 
<A NAME="140"></A>constitution, but does not attack the bilious. Yet, if it were more divine 
<A NAME="141"></A>than the others, this disease ought to befall all alike, and make no distinction 
<A NAME="142"></A>between the bilious and phlegmatic.
<A NAME="143"></A><BR><BR>But the brain is the cause of this affection, as it is of other 
<A NAME="144"></A>very great diseases, and in what manner and from what cause it is formed, 
<A NAME="145"></A>I will now plainly declare. The brain of man, as in all other animals, 
<A NAME="146"></A>is double, and a thin membrane divides it through the middle, and therefore 
<A NAME="147"></A>the pain is not always in the same part of the head; for sometimes it is 
<A NAME="148"></A>situated on either side, and sometimes the whole is affected; and veins 
<A NAME="149"></A>run toward it from all parts of the body, many of which are small, but 
<A NAME="150"></A>two are thick, the one from the liver, and the other from the spleen. And 
<A NAME="151"></A>it is thus with regard to the one from the liver: a portion of it runs 
<A NAME="152"></A>downward through the parts on the side, near the kidneys and the psoas 
<A NAME="153"></A>muscles, to the inner part of the thigh, and extends to the foot. It is 
<A NAME="154"></A>called vena cava. The other runs upward by the right veins and the lungs, 
<A NAME="155"></A>and divides into branches for the heart and the right arm. The remaining 
<A NAME="156"></A>part of it rises upward across the clavicle to the right side of the neck, 
<A NAME="157"></A>and is superficial so as to be seen; near the ear it is concealed, and 
<A NAME="158"></A>there it divides; its thickest, largest, and most hollow part ends in the 
<A NAME="159"></A>brain; another small vein goes to the right ear, another to the right eye, 
<A NAME="160"></A>and another to the nostril. Such are the distributions of the hepatic vein. 
<A NAME="161"></A>And a vein from the spleen is distributed on the left side, upward and 
<A NAME="162"></A>downward, like that from the liver, but more slender and 
<A NAME="163"></A>feeble.
<A NAME="164"></A><BR><BR>By these veins we draw in much breath, since they are the spiracles 
<A NAME="165"></A>of our bodies inhaling air to themselves and distributing it to the rest 
<A NAME="166"></A>of the body, and to the smaller veins, and they and afterwards exhale it. 
<A NAME="167"></A>For the breath cannot be stationary, but it passes upward and downward, 
<A NAME="168"></A>for if stopped and intercepted, the part where it is stopped becomes powerless. 
<A NAME="169"></A>In proof of this, when, in sitting or lying, the small veins are compressed, 
<A NAME="170"></A>so that the breath from the larger vein does not pass into them, the part 
<A NAME="171"></A>is immediately seized with numbness; and it is so likewise with regard 
<A NAME="172"></A>to the other veins.
<A NAME="173"></A><BR><BR>This malady, then, affects phlegmatic people, but not bilious. 
<A NAME="174"></A>It begins to be formed while the foetus is still in utero. For the brain, 
<A NAME="175"></A>like the other organs, is depurated and grows before birth. If, then, in 
<A NAME="176"></A>this purgation it be properly and moderately depurated, and neither more 
<A NAME="177"></A>nor less than what is proper be secreted from it, the head is thus in the 
<A NAME="178"></A>most healthy condition. If the secretion (melting) the from the brain be 
<A NAME="179"></A>greater than natural, the person, when he grows up, will have his head 
<A NAME="180"></A>diseased, and full of noises, and will neither be able to endure the sun 
<A NAME="181"></A>nor cold. Or, if the melting take place from any one part, either from 
<A NAME="182"></A>the eye or ear, or if a vein has become slender, that part will be deranged 
<A NAME="183"></A>in proportion to the melting. Or, should depuration not take place, but 
<A NAME="184"></A>congestion accumulate in the brain, it necessarily becomes phlegmatic. 
<A NAME="185"></A>And such children as have an eruption of ulcers on the head, on the ears, 
<A NAME="186"></A>and along the rest of the body, with copious discharges of saliva and mucus,-these, 
<A NAME="187"></A>in after life, enjoy best health; for in this way the phlegm which ought 
<A NAME="188"></A>to have been purged off in the womb, is discharged and cleared away, and 
<A NAME="189"></A>persons so purged, for the most part, are not subject to attacks of this 
<A NAME="190"></A>disease. But such as have had their skin free from eruptions, and have 
<A NAME="191"></A>had no discharge of saliva or mucus, nor have undergone the proper purgation 
<A NAME="192"></A>in the womb, these persons run the risk of being seized with this 
<A NAME="193"></A>disease.
<A NAME="194"></A><BR><BR>But should the defluxion make its way to the heart, the person 
<A NAME="195"></A>is seized with palpitation and asthma, the chest becomes diseased, and 
<A NAME="196"></A>some also have curvature of the spine. For when a defluxion of cold phlegm 
<A NAME="197"></A>takes place on the lungs and heart, the blood is chilled, and the veins, 
<A NAME="198"></A>being violently chilled, palpitate in the lungs and heart, and the heart 
<A NAME="199"></A>palpitates, so that from this necessity asthma and orthopnoea supervene. 
<A NAME="200"></A>For it does not receive the spirits as much breath as he needs until the 
<A NAME="201"></A>defluxion of phlegm be mastered, and being heated is distributed to the 
<A NAME="202"></A>veins, then it ceases from its palpitation and difficulty of breathing, 
<A NAME="203"></A>and this takes place as soon as it obtains an abundant supply; and this 
<A NAME="204"></A>will be more slowly, provided the defluxion be more abundant, or if it 
<A NAME="205"></A>be less, more quickly. And if the defluxions be more condensed, the epileptic 
<A NAME="206"></A>attacks will be more frequent, but otherwise if it be rarer. Such are the 
<A NAME="207"></A>symptoms when the defluxion is upon the lungs and heart; but if it be upon 
<A NAME="208"></A>the bowels, the person is attacked with diarrhoea.
<A NAME="209"></A><BR><BR>And if, being shut out from all these outlets, its defluxion be 
<A NAME="210"></A>determined to the veins I have formerly mentioned, the patient loses his 
<A NAME="211"></A>speech, and chokes, and foam issues by the mouth, the teeth are fixed, 
<A NAME="212"></A>the hands are contracted, the eyes distorted, he becomes insensible, and 
<A NAME="213"></A>in some cases the bowels are evacuated. And these symptoms occur sometimes 
<A NAME="214"></A>on the left side, sometimes on the right, and sometimes in both. The cause 
<A NAME="215"></A>of everyone of these symptoms I will now explain. The man becomes speechless 
<A NAME="216"></A>when the phlegm, suddenly descending into the veins, shuts out the air, 
<A NAME="217"></A>and does not admit it either to the brain or to the vena cava, or to the 
<A NAME="218"></A>ventricles, but interrupts the inspiration. For when a person draws in 
<A NAME="219"></A>air by the mouth and nostrils, the breath goes first to the brain, then 
<A NAME="220"></A>the greater part of it to the internal cavity, and part to the lungs, and 
<A NAME="221"></A>part to the veins, and from them it is distributed to the other parts of 
<A NAME="222"></A>the body along the veins; and whatever passes to the stomach cools, and 
<A NAME="223"></A>does nothing more; and so also with regard to the lungs. But the air which 
<A NAME="224"></A>enters the veins is of use (to the body) by entering the brain and its 
<A NAME="225"></A>ventricles, and thus it imparts sensibility and motion to all the members, 
<A NAME="226"></A>so that when the veins are excluded from the air by the phlegm and do not 
<A NAME="227"></A>receive it, the man loses his speech and intellect, and the hands become 
<A NAME="228"></A>powerless, and are contracted, the blood stopping and not being diffused, 
<A NAME="229"></A>as it was wont; and the eyes are distorted owing to the veins being excluded 
<A NAME="230"></A>from the air; and they palpitate; and froth from the lungs issues by the 
<A NAME="231"></A>mouth. For when the breath does not find entrance to him, he foams and 
<A NAME="232"></A>sputters like a dying person. And the bowels are evacuated in consequence 
<A NAME="233"></A>of the violent suffocation; and the suffocation is produced when the liver 
<A NAME="234"></A>and stomach ascend to the diaphragm, and the mouth of the stomach is shut 
<A NAME="235"></A>up; this takes place when the breath does not enter by the mouth, as it 
<A NAME="236"></A>is wont. The patient kicks with his feet when the air is shut up in the 
<A NAME="237"></A>lungs and cannot find an outlet, owing to the phlegm; and rushing by the 
<A NAME="238"></A>blood upward and downward, it occasions convulsions and pain, and therefore 
<A NAME="239"></A>he kicks with his feet. All these symptoms he endures when the cold phlegm 
<A NAME="240"></A>passes into the warm blood, for it congeals and stops the blood. And if 
<A NAME="241"></A>the deflexion be copious and thick, it immediately proves fatal to him, 
<A NAME="242"></A>for by its cold it prevails over the blood and congeals it; or, if it be 
<A NAME="243"></A>less, it in the first place obtains the mastery, and stops the respiration; 
<A NAME="244"></A>and then in the course of time, when it is diffused along the veins and 
<A NAME="245"></A>mixed with much warm blood, it is thus overpowered, the veins receive the 
<A NAME="246"></A>air, and the patient recovers his senses.
<A NAME="247"></A><BR><BR>Of little children who are seized with this disease, the greater 
<A NAME="248"></A>part die, provided the defluxion be copious and humid, for the veins being 
<A NAME="249"></A>slender cannot admit the phlegm, owing to its thickness and abundance; 
<A NAME="250"></A>but the blood is cooled and congealed, and the child immediately dies. 
<A NAME="251"></A>But if the phlegm be in small quantity, and make a defluxion into both 
<A NAME="252"></A>the veins, or to those on either side, the children survive, but exhibit 
<A NAME="253"></A>notable marks of the disorder; for either the mouth is drawn aside, or 
<A NAME="254"></A>an eye, the neck, or a hand, wherever a vein being filled with phlegm loses 
<A NAME="255"></A>its tone, and is attenuated, and the part of the body connected with this 
<A NAME="256"></A>vein is necessarily rendered weaker and defective. But for the most it 
<A NAME="257"></A>affords relief for a longer interval; for the child is no longer seized 
<A NAME="258"></A>with these attacks, if once it has contracted this impress of the disease, 
<A NAME="259"></A>in consequence of which the other veins are necessarily affected, and to 
<A NAME="260"></A>a certain degree attenuated, so as just to admit the air, but no longer 
<A NAME="261"></A>to permit the influx of phlegm. However, the parts are proportionally enfeebled 
<A NAME="262"></A>whenever the veins are in an unhealthy state. When in striplings the defluxion 
<A NAME="263"></A>is small and to the right side, they recover without leaving any marks 
<A NAME="264"></A>of the disease, but there is danger of its becoming habitual, and even 
<A NAME="265"></A>increasing if not treated by suitable remedies. Thus, or very nearly so, 
<A NAME="266"></A>is the case when it attacks children.
<A NAME="267"></A><BR><BR>To persons of a more advanced age, it neither proves fatal, nor 
<A NAME="268"></A>produces distortions. For their veins are capacious and are filled with 
<A NAME="269"></A>hot blood; and therefore the phlegm can neither prevail nor cool the blood, 
<A NAME="270"></A>so as to coagulate it, but it is quickly overpowered and mixed with the 
<A NAME="271"></A>blood, and thus the veins receive the air, and sensibility remains; and, 
<A NAME="272"></A>owing to their strength, the aforesaid symptoms are less likely to seize 
<A NAME="273"></A>them. But when this disease attacks very old people, it therefore proves 
<A NAME="274"></A>fatal, or induces paraplegia, because the veins are empty, and the blood 
<A NAME="275"></A>scanty, thin, and watery. When, therefore, the defluxion is copious, and 
<A NAME="276"></A>the season winter, it proves fatal; for it chokes up the exhalents, and 
<A NAME="277"></A>coagulates the blood if the defluxion be to both sides; but if to either, 
<A NAME="278"></A>it merely induces paraplegia. For the blood being thin, cold, and scanty, 
<A NAME="279"></A>cannot prevail over the but being itself overpowered, it is coagulated, 
<A NAME="280"></A>so that those parts in which the blood is corrupted, lose their 
<A NAME="281"></A>strength.
<A NAME="282"></A><BR><BR>The flux is to the right rather than to the left because the veins 
<A NAME="283"></A>there are more capacious and numerous than on the left side, for on the 
<A NAME="284"></A>one side they spring from the liver, and on the other from the spleen. 
<A NAME="285"></A>The defluxion and melting down take place most especially in the case of 
<A NAME="286"></A>children in whom the head is heated either by the sun or by fire, or if 
<A NAME="287"></A>the brain suddenly contract a rigor, and then the phlegm is excreted. For 
<A NAME="288"></A>it is melted down by the heat and diffusion of the but it is excreted by 
<A NAME="289"></A>the congealing and contracting of it, and thus a defluxion takes place. 
<A NAME="290"></A>And in some this is the cause of the disease, and in others, when the south 
<A NAME="291"></A>wind quickly succeeds to northern breezes, it suddenly unbinds and relaxes 
<A NAME="292"></A>the brain, which is contracted and weak, so that there is an inundation 
<A NAME="293"></A>of phlegm, and thus the defluxion takes place. The defluxion also takes 
<A NAME="294"></A>place in consequence of fear, from any hidden cause, if we are the at any 
<A NAME="295"></A>person's calling aloud, or while crying, when one cannot quickly recover 
<A NAME="296"></A>one's breath, such as often happens to children. When any of these things 
<A NAME="297"></A>occur, the body immediately shivers, the person becoming speechless cannot 
<A NAME="298"></A>draw his breath, but the breath (pneuma) stops, the brain is contracted, 
<A NAME="299"></A>the blood stands still, and thus the excretion and defluxion of the phlegm 
<A NAME="300"></A>take place. In children, these are the causes of the attack at first. But 
<A NAME="301"></A>to old persons winter is most inimical. For when the head and brain have 
<A NAME="302"></A>been heated at a great fire, and then the person is brought into cold and 
<A NAME="303"></A>has a rigor, or when from cold he comes into warmth, and sits at the fire, 
<A NAME="304"></A>he is apt to suffer in the same way, and thus he is seized in the manner 
<A NAME="305"></A>described above. And there is much danger of the same thing occurring, 
<A NAME="306"></A>if his head be exposed to the sun, but less so in summer, as the changes 
<A NAME="307"></A>are not sudden. When a person has passed the twentieth year of his life, 
<A NAME="308"></A>this disease is not apt to seize him, unless it has become habitual from 
<A NAME="309"></A>childhood, or at least this is rarely or never the case. For the veins 
<A NAME="310"></A>are filled with blood, and the brain consistent and firm, so that it does 
<A NAME="311"></A>not run down into the veins, or if it do, it does not master the blood, 
<A NAME="312"></A>which is copious and hot.
<A NAME="313"></A><BR><BR>But when it has gained strength from one's childhood, and become 
<A NAME="314"></A>habitual, such a person usually suffers attacks, and is seized with them 
<A NAME="315"></A>in changes of the winds, especially in south winds, and it is difficult 
<A NAME="316"></A>of removal. For the brain becomes more humid than natural, and is inundated 
<A NAME="317"></A>with phlegm, so that the defluxions become more frequent, and the phlegm 
<A NAME="318"></A>can no longer be the nor the brain be dried up, but it becomes wet and 
<A NAME="319"></A>humid. This you may ascertain in particular, from beasts of the flock which 
<A NAME="320"></A>are seized with this disease, and more especially goats, for they are most 
<A NAME="321"></A>frequently attacked with it. If you will cut open the head, you will find 
<A NAME="322"></A>the brain humid, full of sweat, and having a bad smell. And in this way 
<A NAME="323"></A>truly you may see that it is not a god that injures the body, but disease. 
<A NAME="324"></A>And so it is with man. For when the disease has prevailed for a length 
<A NAME="325"></A>of time, it is no longer curable, as the brain is corroded by the phlegm, 
<A NAME="326"></A>and melted, and what is melted down becomes water, and surrounds the brain 
<A NAME="327"></A>externally, and overflows it; wherefore they are more frequently and readily 
<A NAME="328"></A>seized with the disease. And therefore the disease is protracted, because 
<A NAME="329"></A>the influx is thin, owing to its quantity, and is immediately overpowered 
<A NAME="330"></A>by the blood and heated all through.
<A NAME="331"></A><BR><BR>But such persons as are habituated to the disease know beforehand 
<A NAME="332"></A>when they are about to be seized and flee from men; if their own house 
<A NAME="333"></A>be at hand, they run home, but if not, to a deserted place, where as few 
<A NAME="334"></A>persons as possible will see them falling, and they immediately cover themselves 
<A NAME="335"></A>up. This they do from shame of the affection, and not from fear of the 
<A NAME="336"></A>divinity, as many suppose. And little children at first fall down wherever 
<A NAME="337"></A>they may happen to be, from inexperience. But when they have been often 
<A NAME="338"></A>seized, and feel its approach beforehand, they flee to their mothers, or 
<A NAME="339"></A>to any other person they are acquainted with, from terror and dread of 
<A NAME="340"></A>the affection, for being still infants they do not know yet what it is 
<A NAME="341"></A>to be ashamed.
<A NAME="342"></A><BR><BR>Therefore, they are attacked during changes of the winds, and especially 
<A NAME="343"></A>south winds, then also with north winds, and afterwards also with the others. 
<A NAME="344"></A>These are the strongest winds, and the most opposed to one another, both 
<A NAME="345"></A>as to direction and power. For, the north wind condenses the air, and separates 
<A NAME="346"></A>from it whatever is muddy and nebulous, and renders it clearer and brighter, 
<A NAME="347"></A>and so in like manner also, all the winds which arise from the sea and 
<A NAME="348"></A>other waters; for they extract the humidity and nebulosity from all objects, 
<A NAME="349"></A>and from men themselves, and therefore it (the north wind) is the most 
<A NAME="350"></A>wholesome of the winds. But the effects of the south are the very reverse. 
<A NAME="351"></A>For in the first place it begins by melting and diffusing the condensed 
<A NAME="352"></A>air, and therefore it does not blow strong at first, but is gentle at the 
<A NAME="353"></A>commencement, because it is not able at once to overcome the and compacted 
<A NAME="354"></A>air, which yet in a while it dissolves. It produces the same effects upon 
<A NAME="355"></A>the land, the sea, the fountains, the wells, and on every production which 
<A NAME="356"></A>contains humidity, and this, there is in all things, some more, some less. 
<A NAME="357"></A>For all these feel the effects of this wind, and from clear they become 
<A NAME="358"></A>cloudy, from cold, hot; from dry, moist; and whatever ear then vessels 
<A NAME="359"></A>are placed upon the ground, filled with wine or any other fluid, are affected 
<A NAME="360"></A>with the south wind, and undergo a change. And the a change. And the sun, 
<A NAME="361"></A>and the moon, it renders blunter appearance than they naturally are. When, 
<A NAME="362"></A>then, it possesses such powers over things so great and strong, and the 
<A NAME="363"></A>body is made to feel and undergo changes in the changes of the winds, it 
<A NAME="364"></A>necessarily follows that the brain should be disolved and overpowered with 
<A NAME="365"></A>moisture, and that the veins should become more relaxed by the south winds, 
<A NAME="366"></A>and that by the north the healthiest portion of the brain should become 
<A NAME="367"></A>contracted, while the most morbid and humid is secreted, and overflows 
<A NAME="368"></A>externally, and that catarrhs should thus take place in the changes of 
<A NAME="369"></A>these winds. Thus is this disease formed and prevails from those things 
<A NAME="370"></A>which enter into and go out of the body, and it is not more difficult to 
<A NAME="371"></A>understand or to cure than the others, neither is it more divine than other 
<A NAME="372"></A>diseases.
<A NAME="373"></A><BR><BR>Men ought to know that from nothing else but the brain come joys, 
<A NAME="374"></A>delights, laughter and sports, and sorrows, griefs, despondency, and lamentations. 
<A NAME="375"></A>And by this, in an especial manner, we acquire wisdom and knowledge, and 
<A NAME="376"></A>see and hear, and know what are foul and what are fair, what are bad and 
<A NAME="377"></A>what are good, what are sweet, and what unsavory; some we discriminate 
<A NAME="378"></A>by habit, and some we perceive by their utility. By this we distinguish 
<A NAME="379"></A>objects of relish and disrelish, according to the seasons; and the same 
<A NAME="380"></A>things do not always please us. And by the same organ we become mad and 
<A NAME="381"></A>delirious, and fears and terrors assail us, some by night, and some by 
<A NAME="382"></A>day, and dreams and untimely wanderings, and cares that are not suitable, 
<A NAME="383"></A>and ignorance of present circumstances, desuetude, and unskilfulness. All 
<A NAME="384"></A>these things we endure from the brain, when it is not healthy, but is more 
<A NAME="385"></A>hot, more cold, more moist, or more dry than natural, or when it suffers 
<A NAME="386"></A>any other preternatural and unusual affection. And we become mad from its 
<A NAME="387"></A>humidity. For when it is more moist than natural, it is necessarily put 
<A NAME="388"></A>into motion, and the affection being moved, neither the sight nor hearing 
<A NAME="389"></A>can be at rest, and the tongue speaks in accordance with the sight and 
<A NAME="390"></A>hearing.
<A NAME="391"></A><BR><BR>As long as the brain is at rest, the man enjoys his reason, but 
<A NAME="392"></A>the depravement of the brain arises from phlegm and bile, either of which 
<A NAME="393"></A>you may recognize in this manner: Those who are mad from phlegm are quiet, 
<A NAME="394"></A>and do not cry out nor make a noise; but those from bile are vociferous, 
<A NAME="395"></A>malignant, and will not be quiet, but are always doing something improper. 
<A NAME="396"></A>If the madness be constant, these are the causes thereof. But if terrors 
<A NAME="397"></A>and fears assail, they are connected with derangement of the brain, and 
<A NAME="398"></A>derangement is owing to its being heated. And it is heated by bile when 
<A NAME="399"></A>it is determined to the brain along the bloodvessels running from the trunk; 
<A NAME="400"></A>and fear is present until it returns again to the veins and trunk, when 
<A NAME="401"></A>it ceases. He is grieved and troubled when the brain is unseasonably cooled 
<A NAME="402"></A>and contracted beyond its wont. This it suffers from phlegm, and from the 
<A NAME="403"></A>same affection the patient becomes oblivious. He calls out and screams 
<A NAME="404"></A>at night when the brain is suddenly heated. The bilious endure this. But 
<A NAME="405"></A>the phlegmatic are not heated, except when much blood goes to the brain, 
<A NAME="406"></A>and creates an ebullition. Much blood passes along the aforesaid veins. 
<A NAME="407"></A>But when the man happens to see a frightful dream and is in fear as if 
<A NAME="408"></A>awake, then his face is in a greater glow, and the eyes are red when the 
<A NAME="409"></A>patient is in fear. And the understanding meditates doing some mischief, 
<A NAME="410"></A>and thus it is affected in sleep. But if, when awakened, he returns to 
<A NAME="411"></A>himself, and the blood is again distributed along the veins, it 
<A NAME="412"></A>ceases.
<A NAME="413"></A><BR><BR>In these ways I am of the opinion that the brain exercises the 
<A NAME="414"></A>greatest power in the man. This is the interpreter to us of those things 
<A NAME="415"></A>which emanate from the air, when the brain happens to be in a sound state. 
<A NAME="416"></A>But the air supplies sense to it. And the eyes, the ears, the tongue and 
<A NAME="417"></A>the feet, administer such things as the brain cogitates. For in as much 
<A NAME="418"></A>as it is supplied with air, does it impart sense to the body. It is the 
<A NAME="419"></A>brain which is the messenger to the understanding. For when the man draws 
<A NAME="420"></A>the breath into himself, it passes first to the brain, and thus the air 
<A NAME="421"></A>is distributed to the rest of the body, leaving in the brain its acme, 
<A NAME="422"></A>and whatever has sense and understanding. For if it passed first to the 
<A NAME="423"></A>body and last to the brain, then having left in the flesh and veins the 
<A NAME="424"></A>judgment, when it reached the brain it would be hot, and not at all pure, 
<A NAME="425"></A>but mixed with the humidity from flesh and blood, so as to be no longer 
<A NAME="426"></A>pure.
<A NAME="427"></A><BR><BR>Wherefore, I say, that it is the brain which interprets the understanding. 
<A NAME="428"></A>But the diaphragm has obtained its name (frenes) from accident and usage, 
<A NAME="429"></A>and not from reality or nature, for I know no power which it possesses, 
<A NAME="430"></A>either as to sense or understanding, except that when the man is affected 
<A NAME="431"></A>with unexpected joy or sorrow, it throbs and produces palpitations, owing 
<A NAME="432"></A>to its thinness, and as having no belly to receive anything good or bad 
<A NAME="433"></A>that may present themselves to it, but it is thrown into commotion by both 
<A NAME="434"></A>these, from its natural weakness. It then perceives beforehand none of 
<A NAME="435"></A>those things which occur in the body, but has received its name vaguely 
<A NAME="436"></A>and without any proper reason, like the parts about the heart, which are 
<A NAME="437"></A>called auricles, but which contribute nothing towards hearing. Some say 
<A NAME="438"></A>that we think with the heart, and that this is the part which is grieved, 
<A NAME="439"></A>and experiences care. But it is not so; only it contracts like the diaphragm, 
<A NAME="440"></A>and still more so for the same causes. For veins from all parts of the 
<A NAME="441"></A>body run to it, and it has valves, so as to as to perceive if any pain 
<A NAME="442"></A>or pleasurable emotion befall the man. For when grieved the body necessarily 
<A NAME="443"></A>shudders, and is contracted, and from excessive joy it is affected in like 
<A NAME="444"></A>manner. Wherefore the heart and the diaphragm are particularly sensitive, 
<A NAME="445"></A>they have nothing to do, however, with the operations of the understanding, 
<A NAME="446"></A>but of all but of all these the brain is the cause. Since, then, the brain, 
<A NAME="447"></A>as being the primary seat of sense and of the spirits, perceives whatever 
<A NAME="448"></A>occurs in the body, if any change more powerful than usual take place in 
<A NAME="449"></A>the air, owing to the seasons, the brain becomes changed by the state of 
<A NAME="450"></A>the air. For, on this account, the brain first perceives, because, I say, 
<A NAME="451"></A>all the most acute, most powerful, and most deadly diseases, and those 
<A NAME="452"></A>which are most difficult to be understood by the inexperienced, fall upon 
<A NAME="453"></A>the brain.
<A NAME="454"></A><BR><BR>And the disease called the Sacred arises from causes as the others, 
<A NAME="455"></A>namely, those things which enter and quit the body, such as cold, the sun, 
<A NAME="456"></A>and the winds, which are ever changing and are never at rest. And these 
<A NAME="457"></A>things are divine, so that there is no necessity for making a distinction, 
<A NAME="458"></A>and holding this disease to be more divine than the others, but all are 
<A NAME="459"></A>divine, and all human. And each has its own peculiar nature and power, 
<A NAME="460"></A>and none is of an ambiguous nature, or irremediable. And the most of them 
<A NAME="461"></A>are curable by the same means as those by which any other thing is food 
<A NAME="462"></A>to one, and injurious to another. Thus, then, the physician should understand 
<A NAME="463"></A>and distinguish the season of each, so that at one time he may attend to 
<A NAME="464"></A>the nourishment and increase, and at another to abstraction and diminution. 
<A NAME="465"></A>And in this disease as in all others, he must strive not to feed the disease, 
<A NAME="466"></A>but endeavor to wear it out by administering whatever is most opposed to 
<A NAME="467"></A>each disease, and not that which favors and is allied to it. For by that 
<A NAME="468"></A>which is allied to it, it gains vigor and increase, but it wears out and 
<A NAME="469"></A>disappears under the use of that which is opposed to it. But whoever is 
<A NAME="470"></A>acquainted with such a change in men, and can render a man humid and dry, 
<A NAME="471"></A>hot and cold by regimen, could also cure this disease, if he recognizes 
<A NAME="472"></A>the proper season for administering his remedies, without minding purifications, 
<A NAME="473"></A>spells, and all other illiberal practices of a like 
<A NAME="474"></A>kind.
