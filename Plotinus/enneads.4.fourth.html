<A NAME="10"></A><B>First Tractate</B>
<A NAME="11"></A><BR><BR><B>ON THE ESSENCE OF THE SOUL (1).</B>
<A NAME="12"></A><BR><BR><B>1.</B> In the Intellectual Kosmos dwells Authentic Essence, 
<A NAME="13"></A>with the Intellectual-Principle [Divine Mind] as the noblest of its content, 
<A NAME="14"></A>but containing also souls, since every soul in this lower sphere has come 
<A NAME="15"></A>thence: that is the world of unembodied spirits while to our world belong 
<A NAME="16"></A>those that have entered body and undergone bodily division.
<A NAME="17"></A><BR><BR>There the Intellectual-Principle is a concentrated all- nothing 
<A NAME="18"></A>of it distinguished or divided- and in that kosmos of unity all souls are 
<A NAME="19"></A>concentrated also, with no spatial discrimination.
<A NAME="20"></A><BR><BR>But there is a difference:
<A NAME="21"></A><BR>The Intellectual-Principle is for ever repugnant to distinction and 
<A NAME="22"></A>to partition. Soul, there without distinction and partition, has yet a 
<A NAME="23"></A>nature lending itself to divisional existence: its division is secession, 
<A NAME="24"></A>entry into body.
<A NAME="25"></A><BR><BR>In view of this seceding and the ensuing partition we may legitimately 
<A NAME="26"></A>speak of it as a partible thing.
<A NAME="27"></A><BR><BR>But if so, how can it still be described as 
<A NAME="28"></A>indivisible?
<A NAME="29"></A><BR>In that the secession is not of the soul entire; something of it holds 
<A NAME="30"></A>its ground, that in it which recoils from separate existence.
<A NAME="31"></A><BR><BR>The entity, therefore, described as "consisting of the undivided 
<A NAME="32"></A>soul and of the soul divided among bodies," contains a soul which is at 
<A NAME="33"></A>once above and below, attached to the Supreme and yet reaching down to 
<A NAME="34"></A>this sphere, like a radius from a centre.
<A NAME="35"></A><BR><BR>Thus it is that, entering this realm, it possesses still the vision 
<A NAME="36"></A>inherent to that superior phase in virtue of which it unchangingly maintains 
<A NAME="37"></A>its integral nature. Even here it is not exclusively the partible soul: 
<A NAME="38"></A>it is still the impartible as well: what in it knows partition is parted 
<A NAME="39"></A>without partibility; undivided as giving itself to the entire body, a whole 
<A NAME="40"></A>to a whole, it is divided as being effective in every 
<A NAME="41"></A>part.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="42"></A><B>Second Tractate</B>

<A NAME="43"></A><BR><BR><B>ON THE ESSENCE OF THE SOUL (2).</B>
<A NAME="44"></A><BR><BR><B>1.</B> In our attempt to elucidate the Essence of the soul, 
<A NAME="45"></A>we show it to be neither a material fabric nor, among immaterial things, 
<A NAME="46"></A>a harmony. The theory that it is some final development, some entelechy, 
<A NAME="47"></A>we pass by, holding this to be neither true as presented nor practically 
<A NAME="48"></A>definitive.
<A NAME="49"></A><BR><BR>No doubt we make a very positive statement about it when we declare 
<A NAME="50"></A>it to belong to the Intellectual Kind, to be of the divine order; but a 
<A NAME="51"></A>deeper penetration of its nature is demanded.
<A NAME="52"></A><BR><BR>In that allocation we were distinguishing things as they fall under 
<A NAME="53"></A>the Intellectual or the sensible, and we placed the soul in the former 
<A NAME="54"></A>class; now, taking its membership of the Intellectual for granted, we must 
<A NAME="55"></A>investigate by another path the more specific characteristics of its 
<A NAME="56"></A>nature.
<A NAME="57"></A><BR><BR>There are, we hold, things primarily apt to partition, tending 
<A NAME="58"></A>by sheer nature towards separate existence: they are things in which no 
<A NAME="59"></A>part is identical either with another part or with the whole, while, also 
<A NAME="60"></A>their part is necessarily less than the total and whole: these are magnitudes 
<A NAME="61"></A>of the realm of sense, masses, each of which has a station of its own so 
<A NAME="62"></A>that none can be identically present in entirety at more than one point 
<A NAME="63"></A>at one time.
<A NAME="64"></A><BR><BR>But to that order is opposed Essence [Real-Being]; this is in no 
<A NAME="65"></A>degree susceptible of partition; it is unparted and impartible; interval 
<A NAME="66"></A>is foreign to it, cannot enter into our idea of it: it has no need of place 
<A NAME="67"></A>and is not, in diffusion or as an entirety, situated within any other being: 
<A NAME="68"></A>it is poised over all beings at once, and this is not in the sense of using 
<A NAME="69"></A>them as a base but in their being neither capable nor desirous of existing 
<A NAME="70"></A>independently of it; it is an essence eternally unvaried: it is common 
<A NAME="71"></A>to all that follows upon it: it is like the circle's centre to which all 
<A NAME="72"></A>the radii are attached while leaving it unbrokenly in possession of itself, 
<A NAME="73"></A>the starting point of their course and of their essential being, the ground 
<A NAME="74"></A>in which they all participate: thus the indivisible is the principle of 
<A NAME="75"></A>these divided existences and in their very outgoing they remain enduringly 
<A NAME="76"></A>in contact with that stationary essence.
<A NAME="77"></A><BR><BR>So far we have the primarily indivisible- supreme among the Intellectual 
<A NAME="78"></A>and Authentically Existent- and we have its contrary, the Kind definitely 
<A NAME="79"></A>divisible in things of sense; but there is also another Kind, of earlier 
<A NAME="80"></A>rank than the sensible yet near to it and resident within it- an order, 
<A NAME="81"></A>not, like body, primarily a thing of part, but becoming so upon incorporation. 
<A NAME="82"></A>The bodies are separate, and the ideal form which enters them is correspondingly 
<A NAME="83"></A>sundered while, still, it is present as one whole in each of its severed 
<A NAME="84"></A>parts, since amid that multiplicity in which complete individuality has 
<A NAME="85"></A>entailed complete partition, there is a permanent identity; we may think 
<A NAME="86"></A>of colour, qualities of all kinds, some particular shape, which can be 
<A NAME="87"></A>present in many unrelated objects at the one moment, each entire and yet 
<A NAME="88"></A>with no community of experience among the various manifestations. In the 
<A NAME="89"></A>case of such ideal-forms we may affirm complete partibility.
<A NAME="90"></A><BR><BR>But, on the other hand, that first utterly indivisible Kind must 
<A NAME="91"></A>be accompanied by a subsequent Essence, engendered by it and holding indivisibility 
<A NAME="92"></A>from it but, in virtue of the necessary outgo from source, tending firmly 
<A NAME="93"></A>towards the contrary, the wholly partible; this secondary Essence will 
<A NAME="94"></A>take an intermediate Place between the first substance, the undivided, 
<A NAME="95"></A>and that which is divisible in material things and resides in them. Its 
<A NAME="96"></A>presence, however, will differ in one respect from that of colour and quantity; 
<A NAME="97"></A>these, no doubt, are present identically and entire throughout diverse 
<A NAME="98"></A>material masses, but each several manifestation of them is as distinct 
<A NAME="99"></A>from every other as the mass is from the mass.
<A NAME="100"></A><BR><BR>The magnitude present in any mass is definitely one thing, yet 
<A NAME="101"></A>its identity from part to part does not imply any such community as would 
<A NAME="102"></A>entail common experience; within that identity there is diversity, for 
<A NAME="103"></A>it is a condition only, not the actual Essence.
<A NAME="104"></A><BR><BR>The Essence, very near to the impartible, which we assert to belong 
<A NAME="105"></A>to the Kind we are now dealing with, is at once an Essence and an entrant 
<A NAME="106"></A>into body; upon embodiment, it experiences a partition unknown before it 
<A NAME="107"></A>thus bestowed itself.
<A NAME="108"></A><BR><BR>In whatsoever bodies it occupies- even the vastest of all, that 
<A NAME="109"></A>in which the entire universe is included- it gives itself to the whole 
<A NAME="110"></A>without abdicating its unity.
<A NAME="111"></A><BR><BR>This unity of an Essence is not like that of body, which is a unit 
<A NAME="112"></A>by the mode of continuous extension, the mode of distinct parts each occupying 
<A NAME="113"></A>its own space. Nor is it such a unity as we have dealt with in the case 
<A NAME="114"></A>of quality.
<A NAME="115"></A><BR><BR>The nature, at once divisible and indivisible, which we affirm 
<A NAME="116"></A>to be soul has not the unity of an extended thing: it does not consist 
<A NAME="117"></A>of separate sections; its divisibility lies in its presence at every point 
<A NAME="118"></A>of the recipient, but it is indivisible as dwelling entire in the total 
<A NAME="119"></A>and entire in any part.
<A NAME="120"></A><BR><BR>To have penetrated this idea is to know the greatness of the soul 
<A NAME="121"></A>and its power, the divinity and wonder of its being, as a nature transcending 
<A NAME="122"></A>the sphere of Things.
<A NAME="123"></A><BR><BR>Itself devoid of mass, it is present to all mass: it exists here 
<A NAME="124"></A>and yet is There, and this not in distinct phases but with unsundered identity: 
<A NAME="125"></A>thus it is "parted and not parted," or, better, it has never known partition, 
<A NAME="126"></A>never become a parted thing, but remains a self-gathered integral, and 
<A NAME="127"></A>is "parted among bodies" merely in the sense that bodies, in virtue of 
<A NAME="128"></A>their own sundered existence, cannot receive it unless in some partitive 
<A NAME="129"></A>mode; the partition, in other words, is an occurrence in body not in 
<A NAME="130"></A>soul.
<A NAME="131"></A><BR><BR><B>2.</B> It can be demonstrated that soul must, necessarily, be 
<A NAME="132"></A>of just this nature and that there can be no other soul than such a being, 
<A NAME="133"></A>one neither wholly partible but both at once.
<A NAME="134"></A><BR><BR>If it had the nature of body it would consist of isolated members 
<A NAME="135"></A>each unaware of the conditions of every other; there would be a particular 
<A NAME="136"></A>soul- say a soul of the finger- answering as a distinct and independent 
<A NAME="137"></A>entity to every local experience; in general terms, there would be a multiplicity 
<A NAME="138"></A>of souls administering each individual; and, moreover, the universe would 
<A NAME="139"></A>be governed not by one soul but by an incalculable number, each standing 
<A NAME="140"></A>apart to itself. But, without a dominant unity, continuity is 
<A NAME="141"></A>meaningless.
<A NAME="142"></A><BR><BR>The theory that "Impressions reach the leading-principle by progressive 
<A NAME="143"></A>stages" must be dismissed as mere illusion.
<A NAME="144"></A><BR><BR>In the first place, it affirms without investigation a "leading" 
<A NAME="145"></A>phase of the soul.
<A NAME="146"></A><BR><BR>What can justify this assigning of parts to the soul, the distinguishing 
<A NAME="147"></A>one part from another? What quantity, or what difference of quality, can 
<A NAME="148"></A>apply to a thing defined as a self-consistent whole of unbroken 
<A NAME="149"></A>unity?
<A NAME="150"></A><BR><BR>Again, would perception be vested in that leading principle alone, 
<A NAME="151"></A>or in the other phases as well?
<A NAME="152"></A><BR><BR>If a given experience bears only on that "leading principle," it 
<A NAME="153"></A>would not be felt as lodged in any particular members of the organism; 
<A NAME="154"></A>if, on the other hand, it fastens on some other phase of the soul- one 
<A NAME="155"></A>not constituted for sensation- that phase cannot transmit any experience 
<A NAME="156"></A>to the leading principle, and there can be no sensation.
<A NAME="157"></A><BR><BR>Again, suppose sensation vested in the "leading-principle" itself: 
<A NAME="158"></A>then, a first alternative, it will be felt in some one part of that [some 
<A NAME="159"></A>specifically sensitive phase], the other part excluding a perception which 
<A NAME="160"></A>could serve no purpose; or, in the second alternative, there will be many 
<A NAME="161"></A>distinct sensitive phases, an infinite number, with difference from one 
<A NAME="162"></A>to another. In that second case, one sensitive phase will declare "I had 
<A NAME="163"></A>this sensation primarily"; others will have to say "I felt the sensation 
<A NAME="164"></A>that rose elsewhere"; but either the site of the experience will be a matter 
<A NAME="165"></A>of doubt to every phase except the first, or each of the parts of the soul 
<A NAME="166"></A>will be deceived into allocating the occurrence within its own particular 
<A NAME="167"></A>sphere.
<A NAME="168"></A><BR><BR>If, on the contrary, the sensation is vested not merely in the 
<A NAME="169"></A>"leading principle," but in any and every part of the soul, what special 
<A NAME="170"></A>function raises the one rather than the other into that leading rank, or 
<A NAME="171"></A>why is the sensation to be referred to it rather than elsewhere? And how, 
<A NAME="172"></A>at this, account for the unity of the knowledge brought in by diverse senses, 
<A NAME="173"></A>by eyes, by ears?
<A NAME="174"></A><BR><BR>On the other hand, if the soul is a perfect unity- utterly strange 
<A NAME="175"></A>to part, a self-gathered whole- if it continuously eludes all touch of 
<A NAME="176"></A>multiplicity and divisibility- then, no whole taken up into it can ever 
<A NAME="177"></A>be ensouled; soul will stand as circle-centre to every object [remote on 
<A NAME="178"></A>the circumference], and the entire mass of a living being is soulless 
<A NAME="179"></A>still.
<A NAME="180"></A><BR><BR>There is, therefore, no escape: soul is, in the degree indicated, 
<A NAME="181"></A>one and many, parted and impartible. We cannot question the possibility 
<A NAME="182"></A>of a thing being at once a unity and multi-present, since to deny this 
<A NAME="183"></A>would be to abolish the principle which sustains and administers the universe; 
<A NAME="184"></A>there must be a Kind which encircles and supports all and conducts all 
<A NAME="185"></A>with wisdom, a principle which is multiple since existence is multiple, 
<A NAME="186"></A>and yet is one soul always since a container must be a unity: by the multiple 
<A NAME="187"></A>unity of its nature, it will furnish life to the multiplicity of the series 
<A NAME="188"></A>of an all; by its impartible unity, it will conduct a total to wise 
<A NAME="189"></A>ends.
<A NAME="190"></A><BR><BR>In the case of things not endowed with intelligence, the "leading-principle" 
<A NAME="191"></A>is their mere unity- a lower reproduction of the soul's 
<A NAME="192"></A>efficiency.
<A NAME="193"></A><BR><BR>This is the deeper meaning of the profound passage [in the Timaeus], 
<A NAME="194"></A>where we read "By blending the impartible, eternally unchanging essence 
<A NAME="195"></A>with that in division among bodies, he produced a third form of essence 
<A NAME="196"></A>partaking of both qualities."
<A NAME="197"></A><BR><BR>Soul, therefore, is, in this definite sense, one and many; the 
<A NAME="198"></A>Ideal-Form resident in body is many and one; bodies themselves are exclusively 
<A NAME="199"></A>many; the Supreme is exclusively one.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="200"></A><B>Third Tractate</B>

<A NAME="201"></A><BR><BR><B>PROBLEMS OF THE SOUL (1).</B>
<A NAME="202"></A><BR><BR><B>1.</B> The soul: what dubious questions concerning it admit 
<A NAME="203"></A>of solution, or where we must abide our doubt- with, at least, the gain 
<A NAME="204"></A>of recognizing the problem that confronts us- this is matter well worth 
<A NAME="205"></A>attention. On what subject can we more reasonably expend the time required 
<A NAME="206"></A>by minute discussion and investigation? Apart from much else, it is enough 
<A NAME="207"></A>that such an enquiry illuminates two grave questions: of what sphere the 
<A NAME="208"></A>soul is the principle, and whence the soul itself springs. Moreover, we 
<A NAME="209"></A>will be only obeying the ordinance of the God who bade us know 
<A NAME="210"></A>ourselves.
<A NAME="211"></A><BR><BR>Our general instinct to seek and learn, our longing to possess 
<A NAME="212"></A>ourselves of whatsoever is lovely in the vision will, in all reason, set 
<A NAME="213"></A>us enquiring into the nature of the instrument with which we 
<A NAME="214"></A>search.
<A NAME="215"></A><BR><BR>Now even in the universal Intellect [Divine Mind] there was duality, 
<A NAME="216"></A>so that we would expect differences of condition in things of part: how 
<A NAME="217"></A>some things rather than others come to be receptacles of the divine beings 
<A NAME="218"></A>will need to be examined; but all this we may leave aside until we are 
<A NAME="219"></A>considering the mode in which soul comes to occupy body. For the moment 
<A NAME="220"></A>we return to our argument against those who maintain our souls to be offshoots 
<A NAME="221"></A>from the soul of the universe [parts and an identity modally 
<A NAME="222"></A>parted].
<A NAME="223"></A><BR><BR>Our opponents will probably deny the validity of our arguments 
<A NAME="224"></A>against the theory that the human soul is a mere segment of the All-Soul- 
<A NAME="225"></A>the considerations, namely, that it is of identical scope, and that it 
<A NAME="226"></A>is intellective in the same degree, supposing them, even, to admit that 
<A NAME="227"></A>equality of intellection.
<A NAME="228"></A><BR><BR>They will object that parts must necessarily fall under one ideal-form 
<A NAME="229"></A>with their wholes. And they will adduce Plato as expressing their view 
<A NAME="230"></A>where, in demonstrating that the All is ensouled, he says "As our body 
<A NAME="231"></A>is a portion of the body of the All, so our soul is a portion of the soul 
<A NAME="232"></A>of the All." It is admitted on clear evidence that we are borne along by 
<A NAME="233"></A>the Circuit of the All; we will be told that- taking character and destiny 
<A NAME="234"></A>from it, strictly inbound with it- we must derive our souls, also, from 
<A NAME="235"></A>what thus bears us up, and that as within ourselves every part absorbs 
<A NAME="236"></A>from our soul so, analogically, we, standing as parts to the universe, 
<A NAME="237"></A>absorb from the Soul of the All as parts of it. They will urge also that 
<A NAME="238"></A>the dictum "The collective soul cares for all the unensouled," carries 
<A NAME="239"></A>the same implication and could be uttered only in the belief that nothing 
<A NAME="240"></A>whatever of later origin stands outside the soul of the universe, the only 
<A NAME="241"></A>soul there can be there to concern itself with the unensouled.
<A NAME="242"></A><BR><BR><B>2.</B> To this our first answer is that to place certain things 
<A NAME="243"></A>under one identical class- by admitting an identical range of operation- 
<A NAME="244"></A>is to make them of one common species, and puts an end to all mention of 
<A NAME="245"></A>part; the reasonable conclusion would be, on the contrary, that there is 
<A NAME="246"></A>one identical soul, every separate manifestation being that soul 
<A NAME="247"></A>complete.
<A NAME="248"></A><BR><BR>Our opponents after first admitting the unity go on to make our 
<A NAME="249"></A>soul dependent on something else, something in which we have no longer 
<A NAME="250"></A>the soul of this or that, even of the universe, but a soul of nowhere, 
<A NAME="251"></A>a soul belonging neither to the kosmos, nor to anything else, and yet vested 
<A NAME="252"></A>with all the function inherent to the kosmic soul and to that of every 
<A NAME="253"></A>ensouled thing.
<A NAME="254"></A><BR><BR>The soul considered as an entirety cannot be a soul of any one 
<A NAME="255"></A>given thing- since it is an Essence [a divine Real-Being]- or, at least, 
<A NAME="256"></A>there must be a soul which is not exclusively the soul of any particular 
<A NAME="257"></A>thing, and those attached to particulars must so belong merely in some 
<A NAME="258"></A>mode of accident.
<A NAME="259"></A><BR><BR>In such questions as this it is important to clarify the significance 
<A NAME="260"></A>of "part."
<A NAME="261"></A><BR><BR>Part, as understood of body- uniform or varied- need not detain 
<A NAME="262"></A>us; it is enough to indicate that, when part is mentioned in respect of 
<A NAME="263"></A>things whose members are alike, it refers to mass and not to ideal-form 
<A NAME="264"></A>[specific idea]: take for example, whiteness: the whiteness in a portion 
<A NAME="265"></A>of milk is not a part of the whiteness of milk in general: we have the 
<A NAME="266"></A>whiteness of a portion not a portion of whiteness; for whiteness is utterly 
<A NAME="267"></A>without magnitude; has nothing whatever to do with quantity.
<A NAME="268"></A><BR><BR>That is all we need say with regard to part in material things; 
<A NAME="269"></A>but part in the unembodied may be taken in various ways. We may think of 
<A NAME="270"></A>it in the sense familiar in numbers, "two" a part of the standard "ten"- 
<A NAME="271"></A>in abstract numbers of course- or as we think of a segment of a circle, 
<A NAME="272"></A>or line [abstractly considered], or, again, of a section or branch of 
<A NAME="273"></A>knowledge.
<A NAME="274"></A><BR><BR>In the case of the units of reckoning and of geometrical figure, 
<A NAME="275"></A>exactly as in that of corporeal masses, partition must diminish the total; 
<A NAME="276"></A>the part must be less than the whole; for these are things of quantity, 
<A NAME="277"></A>and have their being as things of quantity; and- since they are not the 
<A NAME="278"></A>ideal-form Quantity- they are subject to increase and 
<A NAME="279"></A>decrease.
<A NAME="280"></A><BR><BR>Now in such a sense as this, part cannot be affirmed of the 
<A NAME="281"></A>soul.
<A NAME="282"></A><BR>The soul is not a thing of quantity; we are not to conceive of the 
<A NAME="283"></A>All-Soul as some standard ten with particular souls as its constituent 
<A NAME="284"></A>units.
<A NAME="285"></A><BR><BR>Such a conception would entail many absurdities:
<A NAME="286"></A><BR>The Ten could not be [essentially] a unity [the Soul would be an aggregation, 
<A NAME="287"></A>not a self-standing Real-Being] and, further- unless every one of the single 
<A NAME="288"></A>constituents were itself an All-Soul- the All-Soul would be formed of 
<A NAME="289"></A>non-souls.
<A NAME="290"></A><BR><BR>Again, it is admitted that the particular soul- this "part of the 
<A NAME="291"></A>All-Soul- is of one ideal-form with it, but this does not entail the relation 
<A NAME="292"></A>of part to whole, since in objects formed of continuous parts there is 
<A NAME="293"></A>nothing inevitably making any portion uniform with the total: take, for 
<A NAME="294"></A>example, the parts of a circle or square; we may divide it in different 
<A NAME="295"></A>ways so as to get our part; a triangle need not be divided into triangles; 
<A NAME="296"></A>all sorts of different figures are possible: yet an absolute uniformity 
<A NAME="297"></A>is admitted to reign throughout soul.
<A NAME="298"></A><BR><BR>In a line, no doubt, the part is inevitably a line; but even here 
<A NAME="299"></A>there is a necessary difference in size; and if, in the case of the soul 
<A NAME="300"></A>we similarly called upon magnitude as the distinction between constituents 
<A NAME="301"></A>and collective soul, then soul, thus classed by magnitude becomes quantitative, 
<A NAME="302"></A>and is simply body.
<A NAME="303"></A><BR><BR>But it is admitted that all souls are alike and are entireties; 
<A NAME="304"></A>clearly, soul is not subject to part in the sense in which magnitudes are: 
<A NAME="305"></A>our opponents themselves would not consent to the notion of the All-Soul 
<A NAME="306"></A>being whittled down into fragments, yet this is what they would be doing, 
<A NAME="307"></A>annulling the All-Soul- if any collective soul existed at all- making it 
<A NAME="308"></A>a mere piece of terminology, thinking of it like wine separated into many 
<A NAME="309"></A>portions, each portion, in its jar, being described as a portion of the 
<A NAME="310"></A>total thing, wine.
<A NAME="311"></A><BR><BR>Next there is the conception of the individual soul as a part in 
<A NAME="312"></A>the sense in which we speak of some single proposition as a part of the 
<A NAME="313"></A>science entire.
<A NAME="314"></A><BR><BR>The theorem is separate, but the science stands as one undivided 
<A NAME="315"></A>thing, the expression and summed efficiency [energy] of each constituent 
<A NAME="316"></A>notion: this is partition without severance; each item potentially includes 
<A NAME="317"></A>the whole science, which itself remains an unbroken 
<A NAME="318"></A>total.
<A NAME="319"></A><BR><BR>Is this the appropriate parallel?
<A NAME="320"></A><BR>No; in such a relationship the All-Soul, of which the particular souls 
<A NAME="321"></A>are to be a part, would not be the soul of any definite thing, but an entity 
<A NAME="322"></A>standing aloof; that means that it would not even be the soul of the Kosmos; 
<A NAME="323"></A>it would, in fact, be, itself, one of those partial souls; thus all alike 
<A NAME="324"></A>would be partial and of one nature; and, at that, there would be no reason 
<A NAME="325"></A>for making any such distinction.
<A NAME="326"></A><BR><BR><B>3.</B> Is it a question of part in the sense that, taking one 
<A NAME="327"></A>living being, the soul in a finger might be called a part of the soul 
<A NAME="328"></A>entire?
<A NAME="329"></A><BR><BR>This would carry the alternative that either there is no soul outside 
<A NAME="330"></A>of body, or that- no soul being within body- the thing described as the 
<A NAME="331"></A>soul of the universe is, none the less, outside the body of the universe. 
<A NAME="332"></A>That is a point to be investigated, but for the present we must consider 
<A NAME="333"></A>what kind of soul this parallel would give us.
<A NAME="334"></A><BR><BR>If the particular soul is a part of the All-Soul only in the sense 
<A NAME="335"></A>that this bestows itself upon all living things of the partial sphere, 
<A NAME="336"></A>such a self-bestowal does not imply division; on the contrary, it is the 
<A NAME="337"></A>identical soul that is present everywhere, the one complete thing, multi-present 
<A NAME="338"></A>at the one moment: there is no longer question of a soul that is a part 
<A NAME="339"></A>against a soul that is an all- especially where an identical power is present. 
<A NAME="340"></A>Even difference of function, as in eyes and ears, cannot warrant the assertion 
<A NAME="341"></A>of distinct parts concerned in each separate act- with other parts again 
<A NAME="342"></A>making allotment of faculty- all is met by the notion of one identical 
<A NAME="343"></A>thing, but a thing in which a distinct power operates in each separate 
<A NAME="344"></A>function. All the powers are present either in seeing or in hearing; the 
<A NAME="345"></A>difference in impression received is due to the difference in the organs 
<A NAME="346"></A>concerned; all the varying impressions are our various responses to Ideal-forms 
<A NAME="347"></A>that can be taken in a variety of modes.
<A NAME="348"></A><BR><BR>A further proof [of the unity of Soul] is that perception demands 
<A NAME="349"></A>a common gathering place; every organ has its distinct function, and is 
<A NAME="350"></A>competent only upon its own material, and must interpret each several experience 
<A NAME="351"></A>in its own fashion; the judgement upon these impressions must, then, be 
<A NAME="352"></A>vested in some one principle, a judge informed upon all that is said and 
<A NAME="353"></A>done.
<A NAME="354"></A><BR><BR>But again: "Everywhere, Unity": in the variety of functions if 
<A NAME="355"></A>each "part of the soul" were as distinct as are the entrant sensations, 
<A NAME="356"></A>none of those parts could have knowledge; awareness would belong only to 
<A NAME="357"></A>that judging faculty- or, if local, every such act of awareness would stand 
<A NAME="358"></A>quite unrelated to any other. But since the soul is a rational soul, by 
<A NAME="359"></A>the very same title by which it is an All-Soul, and is called the rational 
<A NAME="360"></A>soul, in the sense of being a whole [and so not merely "reasoning locally"], 
<A NAME="361"></A>then what is thought of as a part must in reality be no part but the identity 
<A NAME="362"></A>of an unparted thing.
<A NAME="363"></A><BR><BR><B>4.</B> But if this is the true account of the unity of soul, 
<A NAME="364"></A>we must be able to meet the problems that ensue: firstly, the difficulty 
<A NAME="365"></A>of one thing being present at the same moment in all things; and, secondly, 
<A NAME="366"></A>the difficulty of soul in body as against soul not embodied.
<A NAME="367"></A><BR><BR>We might be led to think that all soul must always inhabit body; 
<A NAME="368"></A>this would seem especially plausible in the case of the soul of the universe, 
<A NAME="369"></A>not thought of as ever leaving its body as the human soul does: there exists, 
<A NAME="370"></A>no doubt, an opinion that even the human soul, while it must leave the 
<A NAME="371"></A>body, cannot become an utterly disembodied thing; but assuming its complete 
<A NAME="372"></A>disembodiment, how comes it that the human soul can go free of the body 
<A NAME="373"></A>but the All-Soul not, though they are one and the same?
<A NAME="374"></A><BR><BR>There is no such difficulty in the case of the Intellectual-Principle; 
<A NAME="375"></A>by the primal differentiation, this separates, no doubt, into partial things 
<A NAME="376"></A>of widely varying nature, but eternal unity is secured by virtue of the 
<A NAME="377"></A>eternal identity of that Essence: it is not so easy to explain how, in 
<A NAME="378"></A>the case of the soul described as separate among bodies, such differentiated 
<A NAME="379"></A>souls can remain one thing.
<A NAME="380"></A><BR><BR>A possible solution may be offered:
<A NAME="381"></A><BR>The unit soul holds aloof, not actually falling into body; the differentiated 
<A NAME="382"></A>souls- the All-Soul, with the others- issue from the unity while still 
<A NAME="383"></A>constituting, within certain limits, an association. They are one soul 
<A NAME="384"></A>by the fact that they do not belong unreservedly to any particular being; 
<A NAME="385"></A>they meet, so to speak, fringe to fringe; they strike out here and there, 
<A NAME="386"></A>but are held together at the source much as light is a divided thing upon 
<A NAME="387"></A>earth, shining in this house, and that, and yet remains uninterruptedly 
<A NAME="388"></A>one identical substance.
<A NAME="389"></A><BR><BR>The All-Soul would always remain above, since essentially it has 
<A NAME="390"></A>nothing to do with descent or with the lower, or with any tendency towards 
<A NAME="391"></A>this sphere: the other souls would become ours [become "partial," individual 
<A NAME="392"></A>in us] because their lot is cast for this sphere, and because they are 
<A NAME="393"></A>solicited by a thing [the body] which invites their 
<A NAME="394"></A>care.
<A NAME="395"></A><BR><BR>The one- the lowest soul in the to the All-Soul- would correspond 
<A NAME="396"></A>to that in some great growth, silently, unlaboriously conducting the whole; 
<A NAME="397"></A>our own lowest soul might be compared to the insect life in some rotted 
<A NAME="398"></A>part of the growth- for this is the ratio of the animated body to the universe- 
<A NAME="399"></A>while the other soul in us, of one ideal nature with the higher parts of 
<A NAME="400"></A>the All-Soul, may be imaged as the gardener concerned about the insects 
<A NAME="401"></A>lodged in the tree and anxiously working to amend what is wrong; or we 
<A NAME="402"></A>may contrast a healthy man living with the healthy and, by his thought 
<A NAME="403"></A>or by his act, lending himself to the service of those about him, with, 
<A NAME="404"></A>on the other side, a sick man intent upon his own care and cure, and so 
<A NAME="405"></A>living for the body, body-bound.
<A NAME="406"></A><BR><BR><B>5.</B> But what place is left for the particular souls, yours 
<A NAME="407"></A>and mine and another's?
<A NAME="408"></A><BR><BR>May we suppose the Soul to be appropriated on the lower ranges 
<A NAME="409"></A>to some individual, but to belong on the higher to that other 
<A NAME="410"></A>sphere?
<A NAME="411"></A><BR><BR>At this there would be a Socrates as long as Socrates' soul remained 
<A NAME="412"></A>in body; but Socrates ceases to exist, precisely on attainment of the 
<A NAME="413"></A>highest.
<A NAME="414"></A><BR><BR>Now nothing of Real Being is ever annulled.
<A NAME="415"></A><BR>In the Supreme, the Intellectual-Principles are not annulled, for in 
<A NAME="416"></A>their differentiation there is no bodily partition, no passing of each 
<A NAME="417"></A>separate phase into a distinct unity; every such phase remains in full 
<A NAME="418"></A>possession of that identical being. It is exactly so with the 
<A NAME="419"></A>souls.
<A NAME="420"></A><BR><BR>By their succession they are linked to the several Intellectual-Principles, 
<A NAME="421"></A>for they are the expression, the Logos, of the Intellectual-Principles, 
<A NAME="422"></A>of which they are the unfolding; brevity has opened out to multiplicity; 
<A NAME="423"></A>by that point of their being which least belongs to the partial order, 
<A NAME="424"></A>they are attached each to its own Intellectual original: they have already 
<A NAME="425"></A>chosen the way of division; but to the extreme they cannot go; thus they 
<A NAME="426"></A>keep, at once, identification and difference; each soul is permanently 
<A NAME="427"></A>a unity [a self] and yet all are, in their total, one 
<A NAME="428"></A>being.
<A NAME="429"></A><BR><BR>Thus the gist of the matter is established: one soul the source 
<A NAME="430"></A>of all; those others, as a many founded in that one, are, on the analogy 
<A NAME="431"></A>of the Intellectual-Principle, at once divided and undivided; that Soul 
<A NAME="432"></A>which abides in the Supreme is the one expression or Logos of the Intellectual-Principle, 
<A NAME="433"></A>and from it spring other Reason-Principles, partial but immaterial, exactly 
<A NAME="434"></A>as in the differentiation of the Supreme.
<A NAME="435"></A><BR><BR><B>6.</B> But how comes it that while the All-Soul has produced 
<A NAME="436"></A>a kosmos, the soul of the particular has not, though it is of the one ideal 
<A NAME="437"></A>Kind and contains, it too, all things in itself?
<A NAME="438"></A><BR><BR>We have indicated that a thing may enter and dwell at the same 
<A NAME="439"></A>time in various places; this ought to be explained, and the enquiry would 
<A NAME="440"></A>show how an identity resident simultaneously here and there may, in its 
<A NAME="441"></A>separate appearances, act or react- or both- after distinct modes; but 
<A NAME="442"></A>the matter deserves to be examined in a special discussion.
<A NAME="443"></A><BR><BR>To return, then: how and why has the All-Soul produced a kosmos, 
<A NAME="444"></A>while the particular souls simply administer some one part of 
<A NAME="445"></A>it?
<A NAME="446"></A><BR><BR>In the first place, we are not surprised when men of identical 
<A NAME="447"></A>knowledge differ greatly in effective power.
<A NAME="448"></A><BR><BR>But the reason, we will be asked.
<A NAME="449"></A><BR>The answer might be that there is an even greater difference among 
<A NAME="450"></A>these souls, the one never having fallen away from the All-Soul, but dwelling 
<A NAME="451"></A>within it and assuming body therein, while the others received their allotted 
<A NAME="452"></A>spheres when the body was already in existence, when their sister soul 
<A NAME="453"></A>was already in rule and, as it were, had already prepared habitations for 
<A NAME="454"></A>them. Again, the reason may be that the one [the creative All-Soul] looks 
<A NAME="455"></A>towards the universal Intellectual-Principle [the exemplar of all that 
<A NAME="456"></A>can be], while the others are more occupied with the Intellectual within 
<A NAME="457"></A>themselves, that which is already of the sphere of part; perhaps, too, 
<A NAME="458"></A>these also could have created, but that they were anticipated by that originator- 
<A NAME="459"></A>the work accomplished before them- an impediment inevitable whichsoever 
<A NAME="460"></A>of the souls were first to operate.
<A NAME="461"></A><BR><BR>But it is safer to account for the creative act by nearer connection 
<A NAME="462"></A>with the over-world; the souls whose tendency is exercised within the Supreme 
<A NAME="463"></A>have the greater power; immune in that pure seat they create securely; 
<A NAME="464"></A>for the greater power takes the least hurt from the material within which 
<A NAME="465"></A>it operates; and this power remains enduringly attached to the over-world: 
<A NAME="466"></A>it creates, therefore, self gathered and the created things gather round 
<A NAME="467"></A>it; the other souls, on the contrary, themselves go forth; that can mean 
<A NAME="468"></A>only that they have deserted towards the abyss; a main phase in them is 
<A NAME="469"></A>drawn downward and pulls them with it in the desire towards the 
<A NAME="470"></A>lower.
<A NAME="471"></A><BR><BR>The "secondary and tertiary souls," of which we hear, must be understood 
<A NAME="472"></A>in the sense of closer or remoter position: it is much as in ourselves 
<A NAME="473"></A>the relation to the Supreme is not identical from soul to soul; some of 
<A NAME="474"></A>us are capable of becoming Uniate, others of striving and almost attaining, 
<A NAME="475"></A>while a third rank is much less apt; it is a matter of the degree or powers 
<A NAME="476"></A>of the soul by which our expression is determined- the first degree dominant 
<A NAME="477"></A>in the one person, the second, the third [the merely animal life] in others 
<A NAME="478"></A>while, still, all of us contain all the powers.
<A NAME="479"></A><BR><BR><B>7.</B> So far, so good: but what of the passage in the Philebus 
<A NAME="480"></A>taken to imply that the other souls are parts of the 
<A NAME="481"></A>All-Soul?
<A NAME="482"></A><BR><BR>The statement there made does not bear the meaning read into it; 
<A NAME="483"></A>it expresses only, what the author was then concerned with, that the heavens 
<A NAME="484"></A>are ensouled- a teaching which he maintains in the observation that it 
<A NAME="485"></A>is preposterous to make the heavens soulless when we, who contain a part 
<A NAME="486"></A>of the body of the All, have a soul; how, he asks, could there be soul 
<A NAME="487"></A>in the part and none in the total.
<A NAME="488"></A><BR><BR>He makes his teaching quite clear in the Timaeus, where he shows 
<A NAME="489"></A>us the other souls brought into existence after the All-Soul, but compounded 
<A NAME="490"></A>from the same mixing bowl"; secondary and tertiary are duly marked off 
<A NAME="491"></A>from the primal but every form of soul is presented as being of identical 
<A NAME="492"></A>ideal-nature with the All-Soul.
<A NAME="493"></A><BR><BR>As for saying of the Phaedrus. "All that is soul cares for all 
<A NAME="494"></A>that is soulless," this simply tells us that the corporeal kind cannot 
<A NAME="495"></A>be controlled- fashioned, set in place or brought into being- by anything 
<A NAME="496"></A>but the Soul. And we cannot think that there is one soul whose nature includes 
<A NAME="497"></A>this power and another without it. "The perfect soul, that of the All," 
<A NAME="498"></A>we read, "going its lofty journey, operates upon the kosmos not by sinking 
<A NAME="499"></A>into it, but, as it were, by brooding over it"; and "every perfect soul 
<A NAME="500"></A>exercises this governance"; he distinguishes the other, the soul in this 
<A NAME="501"></A>sphere as "the soul when its wing is broken."
<A NAME="502"></A><BR><BR>As for our souls being entrained in the kosmic circuit, and taking 
<A NAME="503"></A>character and condition thence; this is no indication that they are parts: 
<A NAME="504"></A>soul-nature may very well take some tincture from even the qualities of 
<A NAME="505"></A>place, from water and from air; residence in this city or in that, and 
<A NAME="506"></A>the varying make-up of the body may have their influence [upon our human 
<A NAME="507"></A>souls which, yet, are no parts of place or of body].
<A NAME="508"></A><BR><BR>We have always admitted that as members of the universe we take 
<A NAME="509"></A>over something from the All-Soul; we do not deny the influence of the Kosmic 
<A NAME="510"></A>Circuit; but against all this we oppose another soul in us [the Intellectual 
<A NAME="511"></A>as distinguished from the merely vitalizing] proven to be distinct by that 
<A NAME="512"></A>power of opposition.
<A NAME="513"></A><BR><BR>As for our being begotten children of the kosmos, we answer that 
<A NAME="514"></A>in motherhood the entrant soul is distinct, is not the 
<A NAME="515"></A>mother's.
<A NAME="516"></A><BR><BR><B>8.</B> These considerations, amounting to the settlement of 
<A NAME="517"></A>the question, are not countered by the phenomenon of sympathy; the response 
<A NAME="518"></A>between soul and soul is due to the mere fact that all spring from that 
<A NAME="519"></A>self-same soul [the next to Divine Mind] from which springs the Soul of 
<A NAME="520"></A>the All.
<A NAME="521"></A><BR><BR>We have already stated that the one soul is also multiple; and 
<A NAME="522"></A>we have dealt with the different forms of relationship between part and 
<A NAME="523"></A>whole: we have investigated the different degrees existing within soul; 
<A NAME="524"></A>we may now add, briefly, that differences might be induced, also, by the 
<A NAME="525"></A>bodies with which the soul has to do, and, even more, by the character 
<A NAME="526"></A>and mental operations carried over from the conduct of the previous lives. 
<A NAME="527"></A>"The life-choice made by a soul has a correspondence"- we read- "with its 
<A NAME="528"></A>former lives."
<A NAME="529"></A><BR><BR>As regards the nature of soul in general, the differences have 
<A NAME="530"></A>been defined in the passage in which we mentioned the secondary and tertiary 
<A NAME="531"></A>orders and laid down that, while all souls are all-comprehensive, each 
<A NAME="532"></A>ranks according to its operative phase- one becoming Uniate in the achieved 
<A NAME="533"></A>fact, another in knowledge, another in desire, according to the distinct 
<A NAME="534"></A>orientation by which each is, or tends to become, what it looks upon. The 
<A NAME="535"></A>very fulfillment and perfectionment attainable by souls cannot but be 
<A NAME="536"></A>different.
<A NAME="537"></A><BR><BR>But, if in the total the organization in which they have their 
<A NAME="538"></A>being is compact of variety- as it must be since every Reason-Principle 
<A NAME="539"></A>is a unity of multiplicity and variety, and may be thought of as a psychic 
<A NAME="540"></A>animated organism having many shapes at its command- if this is so and 
<A NAME="541"></A>all constitutes a system in which being is not cut adrift from being, if 
<A NAME="542"></A>there is nothing chance- borne among beings as there is none even in bodily 
<A NAME="543"></A>organisms, then it follows that Number must enter into the scheme; for, 
<A NAME="544"></A>once again, Being must be stable; the members of the Intellectual must 
<A NAME="545"></A>possess identity, each numerically one; this is the condition of individuality. 
<A NAME="546"></A>Where, as in bodily masses, the Idea is not essentially native, and the 
<A NAME="547"></A>individuality is therefore in flux, existence under ideal form can rise 
<A NAME="548"></A>only out of imitation of the Authentic Existences; these last, on the contrary, 
<A NAME="549"></A>not rising out of any such conjunction [as the duality of Idea and dead 
<A NAME="550"></A>Matter] have their being in that which is numerically one, that which was 
<A NAME="551"></A>from the beginning, and neither becomes what it has not been nor can cease 
<A NAME="552"></A>to be what it is.
<A NAME="553"></A><BR><BR>Even supposing Real-Beings [such as soul] to be produced by some 
<A NAME="554"></A>other principle, they are certainly not made from Matter; or, if they were, 
<A NAME="555"></A>the creating principle must infuse into them, from within itself, something 
<A NAME="556"></A>of the nature of Real-Being; but, at this, it would itself suffer change, 
<A NAME="557"></A>as it created more or less. And, after all, why should it thus produce 
<A NAME="558"></A>at any given moment rather than remain for ever stationary?
<A NAME="559"></A><BR><BR>Moreover the produced total, variable from more to less, could 
<A NAME="560"></A>not be an eternal: yet the soul, it stands agreed, is 
<A NAME="561"></A>eternal.
<A NAME="562"></A><BR><BR>But what becomes of the soul's infinity if it is thus 
<A NAME="563"></A>fixed?
<A NAME="564"></A><BR>The infinity is a matter of power: there is question, not of the soul's 
<A NAME="565"></A>being divisible into an infinite number of parts, but of an infinite possible 
<A NAME="566"></A>effectiveness: it is infinity in the sense in which the Supreme God, also, 
<A NAME="567"></A>is free of all bound.
<A NAME="568"></A><BR><BR>This means that it is no external limit that defines the individual 
<A NAME="569"></A>being or the extension of souls any more than of God; on the contrary each 
<A NAME="570"></A>in right of its own power is all that it chooses to be: and we are not 
<A NAME="571"></A>to think of it as going forth from itself [losing its unity by any partition]: 
<A NAME="572"></A>the fact is simply that the element within it, which is apt to entrance 
<A NAME="573"></A>into body, has the power of immediate projection any whither: the soul 
<A NAME="574"></A>is certainly not wrenched asunder by its presence at once in foot and in 
<A NAME="575"></A>finger. Its presence in the All is similarly unbroken; over its entire 
<A NAME="576"></A>range it exists in every several part of everything having even vegetal 
<A NAME="577"></A>life, even in a part cut off from the main; in any possible segment it 
<A NAME="578"></A>is as it is at its source. For the body of the All is a unit, and soul 
<A NAME="579"></A>is everywhere present to it as to one thing.
<A NAME="580"></A><BR><BR>When some animal rots and a multitude of others spring from it, 
<A NAME="581"></A>the Life-Principle now present is not the particular soul that was in the 
<A NAME="582"></A>larger body; that body has ceased to be receptive of soul, or there would 
<A NAME="583"></A>have been no death; what happens is that whatsoever in the product of the 
<A NAME="584"></A>decay is apt material for animal existence of one kind or another becomes 
<A NAME="585"></A>ensouled by the fact that soul is nowhere lacking, though a recipient of 
<A NAME="586"></A>soul may be. This new ensouling does not mean, however, an increase in 
<A NAME="587"></A>the number of souls: all depend from the one or, rather, all remains one: 
<A NAME="588"></A>it is as with ourselves; some elements are shed, others grow in their place; 
<A NAME="589"></A>the soul abandons the discarded and flows into the newcoming as long as 
<A NAME="590"></A>the one soul of the man holds its ground; in the All the one soul holds 
<A NAME="591"></A>its ground for ever; its distinct contents now retain soul and now reject 
<A NAME="592"></A>it, but the total of spiritual beings is unaffected.
<A NAME="593"></A><BR><BR><B>9.</B> But we must examine how soul comes to inhabit the body- 
<A NAME="594"></A>the manner and the process- a question certainly of no minor 
<A NAME="595"></A>interest.
<A NAME="596"></A><BR><BR>The entry of soul into body takes place under two 
<A NAME="597"></A>forms.
<A NAME="598"></A><BR>Firstly, there is the entry- metensomatosis- of a soul present in body 
<A NAME="599"></A>by change from one [wholly material] frame to another or the entry- not 
<A NAME="600"></A>known as metensomatosis, since the nature of the earlier habitacle is not 
<A NAME="601"></A>certainly definable- of a soul leaving an aerial or fiery body for one 
<A NAME="602"></A>of earth.
<A NAME="603"></A><BR><BR>Secondly, there is the entry from the wholly bodiless into any 
<A NAME="604"></A>kind of body; this is the earliest form of any dealing between body and 
<A NAME="605"></A>soul, and this entry especially demands investigation.
<A NAME="606"></A><BR><BR>What then can be thought to have happened when soul, utterly clean 
<A NAME="607"></A>from body, first comes into commerce with the bodily 
<A NAME="608"></A>nature?
<A NAME="609"></A><BR><BR>It is reasonable, necessary even, to begin with the Soul of the 
<A NAME="610"></A>All. Notice that if we are to explain and to be clear, we are obliged to 
<A NAME="611"></A>use such words as "entry" and "ensoulment," though never was this All unensouled, 
<A NAME="612"></A>never did body subsist with soul away, never was there Matter unelaborate; 
<A NAME="613"></A>we separate, the better to understand; there is nothing illegitimate in 
<A NAME="614"></A>the verbal and mental sundering of things which must in fact be 
<A NAME="615"></A>co-existent.
<A NAME="616"></A><BR><BR>The true doctrine may be stated as follows:
<A NAME="617"></A><BR>In the absence of body, soul could not have gone forth, since there 
<A NAME="618"></A>is no other place to which its nature would allow it to descend. Since 
<A NAME="619"></A>go forth it must, it will generate a place for itself; at once body, also, 
<A NAME="620"></A>exists.
<A NAME="621"></A><BR><BR>While the Soul [as an eternal, a Divine Being] is at rest- in rest 
<A NAME="622"></A>firmly based on Repose, the Absolute- yet, as we may put it, that huge 
<A NAME="623"></A>illumination of the Supreme pouring outwards comes at last to the extreme 
<A NAME="624"></A>bourne of its light and dwindles to darkness; this darkness, now lying 
<A NAME="625"></A>there beneath, the soul sees and by seeing brings to shape; for in the 
<A NAME="626"></A>law of things this ultimate depth, neighbouring with soul, may not go void 
<A NAME="627"></A>of whatsoever degree of that Reason-Principle it can absorb, the dimmed 
<A NAME="628"></A>reason of reality at its faintest.
<A NAME="629"></A><BR><BR>Imagine that a stately and varied mansion has been built; it has 
<A NAME="630"></A>never been abandoned by its Architect, who, yet, is not tied down to it; 
<A NAME="631"></A>he has judged it worthy in all its length and breadth of all the care that 
<A NAME="632"></A>can serve to its Being- as far as it can share in Being- or to its beauty, 
<A NAME="633"></A>but a care without burden to its director, who never descends, but presides 
<A NAME="634"></A>over it from above: this gives the degree in which the kosmos is ensouled, 
<A NAME="635"></A>not by a soul belonging to it, but by one present to it; it is mastered 
<A NAME="636"></A>not master; not possessor but possessed. The soul bears it up, and it lies 
<A NAME="637"></A>within, no fragment of it unsharing.
<A NAME="638"></A><BR><BR>The kosmos is like a net which takes all its life, as far as ever 
<A NAME="639"></A>it stretches, from being wet in the water, and has no act of its own; the 
<A NAME="640"></A>sea rolls away and the net with it, precisely to the full of its scope, 
<A NAME="641"></A>for no mesh of it can strain beyond its set place: the soul is of so far-reaching 
<A NAME="642"></A>a nature- a thing unbounded- as to embrace the entire body of the All in 
<A NAME="643"></A>the one extension; so far as the universe extends, there soul is; and if 
<A NAME="644"></A>the universe had no existence, the extent of soul would be the same; it 
<A NAME="645"></A>is eternally what it is. The universe spreads as broad as the presence 
<A NAME="646"></A>of soul; the bound of its expansion is the point at which, in its downward 
<A NAME="647"></A>egression from the Supreme, it still has soul to bind it in one: it is 
<A NAME="648"></A>a shadow as broad as the Reason-Principle proceeding from soul; and that 
<A NAME="649"></A>Reason-Principle is of scope to generate a kosmic bulk as vast as lay in 
<A NAME="650"></A>the purposes of the Idea [the Divine forming power] which it 
<A NAME="651"></A>conveys.
<A NAME="652"></A><BR><BR><B>10.</B> In view of all this we must now work back from the items 
<A NAME="653"></A>to the unit, and consider the entire scheme as one enduring 
<A NAME="654"></A>thing.
<A NAME="655"></A><BR><BR>We ascend from air, light, sun- or, moon and light and sun- in 
<A NAME="656"></A>detail, to these things as constituting a total- though a total of degrees, 
<A NAME="657"></A>primary, secondary, tertiary. Thence we come to the [kosmic] Soul, always 
<A NAME="658"></A>the one undiscriminated entity. At this point in our survey we have before 
<A NAME="659"></A>us the over-world and all that follows upon it. That suite [the lower and 
<A NAME="660"></A>material world] we take to be the very last effect that has penetrated 
<A NAME="661"></A>to its furthest reach.
<A NAME="662"></A><BR><BR>Our knowledge of the first is gained from the ultimate of all, 
<A NAME="663"></A>from the very shadow cast by the fire, because this ultimate [the material 
<A NAME="664"></A>world] itself receives its share of the general light, something of the 
<A NAME="665"></A>nature of the Forming-Idea hovering over the outcast that at first lay 
<A NAME="666"></A>in blank obscurity. It is brought under the scheme of reason by the efficacy 
<A NAME="667"></A>of soul whose entire extension latently holds this rationalizing power. 
<A NAME="668"></A>As we know, the Reason-Principles carried in animal seed fashion and shape 
<A NAME="669"></A>living beings into so many universes in the small. For whatsoever touches 
<A NAME="670"></A>soul is moulded to the nature of soul's own Real-Being.
<A NAME="671"></A><BR><BR>We are not to think that the Soul acts upon the object by conformity 
<A NAME="672"></A>to any external judgement; there is no pause for willing or planning: any 
<A NAME="673"></A>such procedure would not be an act of sheer nature, but one of applied 
<A NAME="674"></A>art: but art is of later origin than soul; it is an imitator, producing 
<A NAME="675"></A>dim and feeble copies- toys, things of no great worth- and it is dependent 
<A NAME="676"></A>upon all sorts of mechanism by which alone its images can be produced. 
<A NAME="677"></A>The soul, on the contrary, is sovereign over material things by might of 
<A NAME="678"></A>Real-Being; their quality is determined by its lead, and those elementary 
<A NAME="679"></A>things cannot stand against its will. On the later level, things are hindered 
<A NAME="680"></A>one by the other, and thus often fall short of the characteristic shape 
<A NAME="681"></A>at which their unextended Reason-Principle must be aiming; in that other 
<A NAME="682"></A>world [under the soul but above the material] the entire shape [as well 
<A NAME="683"></A>as the idea] comes from soul, and all that is produced takes and keeps 
<A NAME="684"></A>its appointed place in a unity, so that the engendered thing, without labour 
<A NAME="685"></A>as without clash, becomes all that it should be. In that world the soul 
<A NAME="686"></A>has elaborated its creation, the images of the gods, dwellings for men, 
<A NAME="687"></A>each existing to some peculiar purpose.
<A NAME="688"></A><BR><BR>Soul could produce none but the things which truly represent its 
<A NAME="689"></A>powers: fire produces warmth; another source produces cold; soul has a 
<A NAME="690"></A>double efficacy, its act within itself, and its act from within outwards 
<A NAME="691"></A>towards the new production.
<A NAME="692"></A><BR><BR>In soulless entities, the outgo [natural to everything] remains 
<A NAME="693"></A>dormant, and any efficiency they have is to bring to their own likeness 
<A NAME="694"></A>whatever is amenable to their act. All existence has this tendency to bring 
<A NAME="695"></A>other things to likeness; but the soul has the distinction of possessing 
<A NAME="696"></A>at once an action of conscious attention within itself, and an action towards 
<A NAME="697"></A>the outer. It has thus the function of giving life to all that does not 
<A NAME="698"></A>live by prior right, and the life it gives is commensurate with its own; 
<A NAME="699"></A>that is to say, living in reason, it communicates reason to the body- an 
<A NAME="700"></A>image of the reason within itself, just as the life given to the body is 
<A NAME="701"></A>an image of Real-Being- and it bestows, also, upon that material the appropriate 
<A NAME="702"></A>shapes of which it contains the Reason-Forms.
<A NAME="703"></A><BR><BR>The content of the creative soul includes the Ideal shapes of gods 
<A NAME="704"></A>and of all else: and hence it is that the kosmos contains 
<A NAME="705"></A>all.
<A NAME="706"></A><BR><BR><B>11.</B> I think, therefore, that those ancient sages, who sought 
<A NAME="707"></A>to secure the presence of divine beings by the erection of shrines and 
<A NAME="708"></A>statues, showed insight into the nature of the All; they perceived that, 
<A NAME="709"></A>though this Soul is everywhere tractable, its presence will be secured 
<A NAME="710"></A>all the more readily when an appropriate receptacle is elaborated, a place 
<A NAME="711"></A>especially capable of receiving some portion or phase of it, something 
<A NAME="712"></A>reproducing it, or representing it, and serving like a mirror to catch 
<A NAME="713"></A>an image of it.
<A NAME="714"></A><BR><BR>It belongs to the nature of the All to make its entire content 
<A NAME="715"></A>reproduce, most felicitously, the Reason-Principles in which it participates; 
<A NAME="716"></A>every particular thing is the image within matter of a Reason-Principle 
<A NAME="717"></A>which itself images a pre-material Reason-Principle: thus every particular 
<A NAME="718"></A>entity is linked to that Divine Being in whose likeness it is made, the 
<A NAME="719"></A>divine principle which the soul contemplated and contained in the act of 
<A NAME="720"></A>each creation. Such mediation and representation there must have been since 
<A NAME="721"></A>it was equally impossible for the created to be without share in the Supreme, 
<A NAME="722"></A>and for the Supreme to descend into the created.
<A NAME="723"></A><BR><BR>The Intellectual-Principle in the Supreme has ever been the sun 
<A NAME="724"></A>of that sphere- let us accept that as the type of the creative Logos- and 
<A NAME="725"></A>immediately upon it follows the Soul depending from it, stationary Soul 
<A NAME="726"></A>from stationary Intelligence. But the Soul borders also upon the sun of 
<A NAME="727"></A>this sphere, and it becomes the medium by which all is linked to the overworld; 
<A NAME="728"></A>it plays the part of an interpreter between what emanates from that sphere 
<A NAME="729"></A>down to this lower universe, and what rises- as far as, through soul, anything 
<A NAME="730"></A>can- from the lower to the highest.
<A NAME="731"></A><BR><BR>Nothing, in fact, is far away from anything; things are not remote: 
<A NAME="732"></A>there is, no doubt, the aloofness of difference and of mingled natures 
<A NAME="733"></A>as against the unmingled; but selfhood has nothing to do with spatial position, 
<A NAME="734"></A>and in unity itself there may still be distinction.
<A NAME="735"></A><BR><BR>These Beings [the Reason-Principles of this sphere] are divine 
<A NAME="736"></A>in virtue of cleaving to the Supreme, because, by the medium of the Soul 
<A NAME="737"></A>thought of as descending they remain linked with the Primal Soul, and through 
<A NAME="738"></A>it are veritably what they are called and possess the vision of the Intellectual 
<A NAME="739"></A>Principle, the single object of contemplation to that soul in which they 
<A NAME="740"></A>have their being.
<A NAME="741"></A><BR><BR><B>12.</B> The souls of men, seeing their images in the mirror 
<A NAME="742"></A>of Dionysus as it were, have entered into that realm in a leap downward 
<A NAME="743"></A>from the Supreme: yet even they are not cut off from their origin, from 
<A NAME="744"></A>the divine Intellect; it is not that they have come bringing the Intellectual 
<A NAME="745"></A>Principle down in their fall; it is that though they have descended even 
<A NAME="746"></A>to earth, yet their higher part holds for ever above the 
<A NAME="747"></A>heavens.
<A NAME="748"></A><BR><BR>Their initial descent is deepened since that mid-part of theirs 
<A NAME="749"></A>is compelled to labour in care of the care-needing thing into which they 
<A NAME="750"></A>have entered. But Zeus, the father, takes pity on their toils and makes 
<A NAME="751"></A>the bonds in which they labour soluble by death and gives respite in due 
<A NAME="752"></A>time, freeing them from the body, that they too may come to dwell there 
<A NAME="753"></A>where the Universal Soul, unconcerned with earthly needs, has ever 
<A NAME="754"></A>dwelt.
<A NAME="755"></A><BR><BR>For the container of the total of things must be a self-sufficing 
<A NAME="756"></A>entity and remain so: in its periods it is wrought out to purpose under 
<A NAME="757"></A>its Reason-Principles which are perdurably valid; by these periods it reverts 
<A NAME="758"></A>unfailingly, in the measured stages of defined life-duration, to its established 
<A NAME="759"></A>character; it is leading the things of this realm to be of one voice and 
<A NAME="760"></A>plan with the Supreme. And thus the kosmic content is carried forward to 
<A NAME="761"></A>its purpose, everything in its co-ordinate place, under one only Reason-Principle 
<A NAME="762"></A>operating alike in the descent and return of souls and to every purpose 
<A NAME="763"></A>of the system.
<A NAME="764"></A><BR><BR>We may know this also by the concordance of the Souls with the 
<A NAME="765"></A>ordered scheme of the kosmos; they are not independent, but, by their descent, 
<A NAME="766"></A>they have put themselves in contact, and they stand henceforth in harmonious 
<A NAME="767"></A>association with kosmic circuit- to the extent that their fortunes, their 
<A NAME="768"></A>life experiences, their choosing and refusing, are announced by the patterns 
<A NAME="769"></A>of the stars- and out of this concordance rises as it were one musical 
<A NAME="770"></A>utterance: the music, the harmony, by which all is described is the best 
<A NAME="771"></A>witness to this truth.
<A NAME="772"></A><BR><BR>Such a consonance can have been procured in one only 
<A NAME="773"></A>way:
<A NAME="774"></A><BR>The All must, in every detail of act and experience, be an expression 
<A NAME="775"></A>of the Supreme, which must dominate alike its periods and its stable ordering 
<A NAME="776"></A>and the life-careers varying with the movement of the souls as they are 
<A NAME="777"></A>sometimes absorbed in that highest, sometimes in the heavens, sometimes 
<A NAME="778"></A>turned to the things and places of our earth. All that is Divine Intellect 
<A NAME="779"></A>will rest eternally above, and could never fall from its sphere but, poised 
<A NAME="780"></A>entire in its own high place, will communicate to things here through the 
<A NAME="781"></A>channel of Soul. Soul in virtue of neighbourhood is more closely modelled 
<A NAME="782"></A>upon the Idea uttered by the Divine Intellect, and thus is able to produce 
<A NAME="783"></A>order in the movement of the lower realm, one phase [the World-Soul] maintaining 
<A NAME="784"></A>the unvarying march [of the kosmic circuit] the other [the soul of the 
<A NAME="785"></A>Individual] adopting itself to times and season.
<A NAME="786"></A><BR><BR>The depth of the descent, also, will differ- sometimes lower, sometimes 
<A NAME="787"></A>less low- and this even in its entry into any given Kind: all that is fixed 
<A NAME="788"></A>is that each several soul descends to a recipient indicated by affinity 
<A NAME="789"></A>of condition; it moves towards the thing which it There resembled, and 
<A NAME="790"></A>enters, accordingly, into the body of man or animal.
<A NAME="791"></A><BR><BR><B>13.</B> The Ineluctable, the Kosmic Law is, thus, rooted in 
<A NAME="792"></A>a natural principle under which each several entity is overruled to go, 
<A NAME="793"></A>duly and in order, towards that place and Kind to which it characteristically 
<A NAME="794"></A>tends, that is towards the image of its primal choice and 
<A NAME="795"></A>constitution.
<A NAME="796"></A><BR><BR>In that archetypal world every form of soul is near to the image 
<A NAME="797"></A>[the thing in the world of copy] to which its individual constitution inclines 
<A NAME="798"></A>it; there is therefore no need of a sender or leader acting at the right 
<A NAME="799"></A>moment to bring it at the right moment whether into body or into a definitely 
<A NAME="800"></A>appropriate body: of its own motion it descends at the precisely true time 
<A NAME="801"></A>and enters where it must. To every Soul its own hour; when that strikes 
<A NAME="802"></A>it descends and enters the body suitable to it as at the cry of a herald; 
<A NAME="803"></A>thus all is set stirring and advancing as by a magician's power or by some 
<A NAME="804"></A>mighty traction; it is much as, in any living thing, the soul itself effects 
<A NAME="805"></A>the fulfillment of the natural career, stirring and bringing forth, in 
<A NAME="806"></A>due season, every element- beard, horn, and all the successive stages of 
<A NAME="807"></A>tendency and of output- or, as it leads a tree through its normal course 
<A NAME="808"></A>within set periods.
<A NAME="809"></A><BR><BR>The Souls go forth neither under compulsion nor of freewill; or, 
<A NAME="810"></A>at least, freedom, here, is not to be regarded as action upon preference; 
<A NAME="811"></A>it is more like such a leap of the nature as moves men to the instinctive 
<A NAME="812"></A>desire of sexual union, or, in the case of some, to fine conduct; the motive 
<A NAME="813"></A>lies elsewhere than in the reason: like is destined unfailingly to like, 
<A NAME="814"></A>and each moves hither or thither at its fixed moment.
<A NAME="815"></A><BR><BR>Even the Intellectual-Principle, which is before all the kosmos, 
<A NAME="816"></A>has, it also, its destiny, that of abiding intact above, and of giving 
<A NAME="817"></A>downwards: what it sends down is the particular whose existence is implied 
<A NAME="818"></A>in the law of the universal; for the universal broods closely over the 
<A NAME="819"></A>particular; it is not from without that the law derives the power by which 
<A NAME="820"></A>it is executed; on the contrary the law is given in the entities upon whom 
<A NAME="821"></A>it falls; these bear it about with them. Let but the moment arrive, and 
<A NAME="822"></A>what it decrees will be brought to act by those beings in whom it resides; 
<A NAME="823"></A>they fulfil it because they contain it; it prevails because it is within 
<A NAME="824"></A>them; it becomes like a heavy burden, and sets up in them a painful longing 
<A NAME="825"></A>to enter the realm to which they are bidden from within.
<A NAME="826"></A><BR><BR><B>14.</B> Thus it comes about that this kosmos, lit with many 
<A NAME="827"></A>lights, gleaming in its souls, receives still further graces, gifts from 
<A NAME="828"></A>here and from there, from the gods of the Supreme, and from those other 
<A NAME="829"></A>Intellectual-Principles whose nature it is to ensoul. This is probably 
<A NAME="830"></A>the secret of the myth in which, after Prometheus had moulded woman, the 
<A NAME="831"></A>other gods heaped gifts upon her, Hephaistos "blending the clay with moisture 
<A NAME="832"></A>and bestowing the human voice and the form of a goddess"; Aphrodite bringing 
<A NAME="833"></A>her gifts, and the Graces theirs, and other gods other gifts, and finally 
<A NAME="834"></A>calling her by the name [Pandora] which tells of gift and of all giving- 
<A NAME="835"></A>for all have added something to this formation brought to being by a Promethean, 
<A NAME="836"></A>a fore-thinking power. As for the rejection of Prometheus' gift by after-thought, 
<A NAME="837"></A>Epimetheus, what can this signify but that the wiser choice is to remain 
<A NAME="838"></A>in the Intellectual realm? Pandora's creator is fettered, to signify that 
<A NAME="839"></A>he is in some sense held by his own creation; such a fettering is external 
<A NAME="840"></A>and the release by Hercules tells that there is power in Prometheus, so 
<A NAME="841"></A>that he need not remain in bonds.
<A NAME="842"></A><BR><BR>Take the myth as we may, it is certainly such an account of the 
<A NAME="843"></A>bestowal of gifts upon the kosmos as harmonizes with our explanation of 
<A NAME="844"></A>the universal system.
<A NAME="845"></A><BR><BR><B>15.</B> The souls peering forth from the Intellectual Realm 
<A NAME="846"></A>descend first to the heavens and there put on a body; this becomes at once 
<A NAME="847"></A>the medium by which as they reach out more and more towards magnitude [physical 
<A NAME="848"></A>extension] they proceed to bodies progressively more earthy. Some even 
<A NAME="849"></A>plunge from heaven to the very lowest of corporeal forms; others pass, 
<A NAME="850"></A>stage by stage, too feeble to lift towards the higher the burden they carry, 
<A NAME="851"></A>weighed downwards by their heaviness and forgetfulness.
<A NAME="852"></A><BR><BR>As for the differences among them, these are due to variation in 
<A NAME="853"></A>the bodies entered, or to the accidents of life, or to upbringing, or to 
<A NAME="854"></A>inherent peculiarities of temperament, or to all these influences together, 
<A NAME="855"></A>or to specific combinations of them.
<A NAME="856"></A><BR><BR>Then again some have fallen unreservedly into the power of the 
<A NAME="857"></A>destiny ruling here: some yielding betimes are betimes too their own: there 
<A NAME="858"></A>are those who, while they accept what must be borne, have the strength 
<A NAME="859"></A>of self-mastery in all that is left to their own act; they have given themselves 
<A NAME="860"></A>to another dispensation: they live by the code of the aggregate of beings, 
<A NAME="861"></A>the code which is woven out of the Reason-Principles and all the other 
<A NAME="862"></A>causes ruling in the kosmos, out of soul-movements and out of laws springing 
<A NAME="863"></A>in the Supreme; a code, therefore, consonant with those higher existences, 
<A NAME="864"></A>founded upon them, linking their sequents back to them, keeping unshakeably 
<A NAME="865"></A>true all that is capable of holding itself set towards the divine nature, 
<A NAME="866"></A>and leading round by all appropriate means whatsoever is less natively 
<A NAME="867"></A>apt.
<A NAME="868"></A><BR><BR>In fine all diversity of condition in the lower spheres is determined 
<A NAME="869"></A>by the descendent beings themselves.
<A NAME="870"></A><BR><BR><B>16.</B> The punishment justly overtaking the wicked must therefore 
<A NAME="871"></A>be ascribed to the kosmic order which leads all in accordance with the 
<A NAME="872"></A>right.
<A NAME="873"></A><BR><BR>But what of chastisements, poverty, illness, falling upon the good 
<A NAME="874"></A>outside of all justice? These events, we will be told, are equally interwoven 
<A NAME="875"></A>into the world order and fall under prediction, and must consequently have 
<A NAME="876"></A>a cause in the general reason: are they therefore to be charged to past 
<A NAME="877"></A>misdoing?
<A NAME="878"></A><BR><BR>No: such misfortunes do not answer to reasons established in the 
<A NAME="879"></A>nature of things; they are not laid up in the master-facts of the universe, 
<A NAME="880"></A>but were merely accidental sequents: a house falls, and anyone that chances 
<A NAME="881"></A>to be underneath is killed, no matter what sort of man he be: two objects 
<A NAME="882"></A>are moving in perfect order- or one if you like- but anything getting in 
<A NAME="883"></A>the way is wounded or trampled down. Or we may reason that the undeserved 
<A NAME="884"></A>stroke can be no evil to the sufferer in view of the beneficent interweaving 
<A NAME="885"></A>of the All or again, no doubt, that nothing is unjust that finds justification 
<A NAME="886"></A>in a past history.
<A NAME="887"></A><BR><BR>We may not think of some things being fitted into a system with 
<A NAME="888"></A>others abandoned to the capricious; if things must happen by cause, by 
<A NAME="889"></A>natural sequences, under one Reason-Principle and a single set scheme, 
<A NAME="890"></A>we must admit that the minor equally with the major is fitted into that 
<A NAME="891"></A>order and pattern.
<A NAME="892"></A><BR><BR>Wrong-doing from man to man is wrong in the doer and must be imputed, 
<A NAME="893"></A>but, as belonging to the established order of the universe is not a wrong 
<A NAME="894"></A>even as regards the innocent sufferer; it is a thing that had to be, and, 
<A NAME="895"></A>if the sufferer is good, the issue is to his gain. For we cannot think 
<A NAME="896"></A>that this ordered combination proceeds without God and justice; we must 
<A NAME="897"></A>take it to be precise in the distribution of due, while, yet, the reasons 
<A NAME="898"></A>of things elude us, and to our ignorance the scheme presents matter of 
<A NAME="899"></A>censure.
<A NAME="900"></A><BR><BR><B>17.</B> Various considerations explain why the Souls going forth 
<A NAME="901"></A>from the Intellectual proceed first to the heavenly regions. The heavens, 
<A NAME="902"></A>as the noblest portion of sensible space, would border with the least exalted 
<A NAME="903"></A>of the Intellectual, and will, therefore, be first ensouled first to participate 
<A NAME="904"></A>as most apt; while what is of earth is at the very extremity of progression, 
<A NAME="905"></A>least endowed towards participation, remotest from the 
<A NAME="906"></A>unembodied.
<A NAME="907"></A><BR><BR>All the souls, then, shine down upon the heavens and spend there 
<A NAME="908"></A>the main of themselves and the best; only their lower phases illuminate 
<A NAME="909"></A>the lower realms; and those souls which descend deepest show their light 
<A NAME="910"></A>furthest down- not themselves the better for the depth to which they have 
<A NAME="911"></A>penetrated.
<A NAME="912"></A><BR><BR>There is, we may put it, something that is centre; about it, a 
<A NAME="913"></A>circle of light shed from it; round centre and first circle alike, another 
<A NAME="914"></A>circle, light from light; outside that again, not another circle of light 
<A NAME="915"></A>but one which, lacking light of its own, must borrow.
<A NAME="916"></A><BR><BR>The last we may figure to ourselves as a revolving circle, or rather 
<A NAME="917"></A>a sphere, of a nature to receive light from that third realm, its next 
<A NAME="918"></A>higher, in proportion to the light which that itself receives. Thus all 
<A NAME="919"></A>begins with the great light, shining self-centred; in accordance with the 
<A NAME="920"></A>reigning plan [that of emanation] this gives forth its brilliance; the 
<A NAME="921"></A>later [divine] existents [souls] add their radiation- some of them remaining 
<A NAME="922"></A>above, while there are some that are drawn further downward, attracted 
<A NAME="923"></A>by the splendour of the object they illuminate. These last find that their 
<A NAME="924"></A>charges need more and more care: the steersman of a storm-tossed ship is 
<A NAME="925"></A>so intent on saving it that he forgets his own interest and never thinks 
<A NAME="926"></A>that he is recurrently in peril of being dragged down with the vessel; 
<A NAME="927"></A>similarly the souls are intent upon contriving for their charges and finally 
<A NAME="928"></A>come to be pulled down by them; they are fettered in bonds of sorcery, 
<A NAME="929"></A>gripped and held by their concern for the realm of Nature.
<A NAME="930"></A><BR><BR>If every living being were of the character of the All-perfect, 
<A NAME="931"></A>self-sufficing, in peril from no outside influence the soul now spoken 
<A NAME="932"></A>of as indwelling would not occupy the body; it would infuse life while 
<A NAME="933"></A>clinging, entire, within the Supreme.
<A NAME="934"></A><BR><BR><B>18.</B> There remains still something to be said on the question 
<A NAME="935"></A>whether the soul uses deliberate reason before its descent and again when 
<A NAME="936"></A>it has left the body.
<A NAME="937"></A><BR><BR>Reasoning is for this sphere; it is the act of the soul fallen 
<A NAME="938"></A>into perplexity, distracted with cares, diminished in strength: the need 
<A NAME="939"></A>of deliberation goes with the less self-sufficing intelligence; craftsmen 
<A NAME="940"></A>faced by a difficulty stop to consider; where there is no problem their 
<A NAME="941"></A>art works on by its own forthright power.
<A NAME="942"></A><BR><BR>But if souls in the Supreme operate without reasoning, how can 
<A NAME="943"></A>they be called reasoning souls?
<A NAME="944"></A><BR><BR>One answer might be that they have the power of deliberating to 
<A NAME="945"></A>happy issue, should occasion arise: but all is met by repudiating the particular 
<A NAME="946"></A>kind of reasoning intended [the earthly and discursive type]; we may represent 
<A NAME="947"></A>to ourselves a reasoning that flows uninterruptedly from the Intellectual-Principle 
<A NAME="948"></A>in them, an inherent state, an enduring activity, an assertion that is 
<A NAME="949"></A>real; in this way they would be users of reason even when in that overworld. 
<A NAME="950"></A>We certainly cannot think of them, it seems to me, as employing words when, 
<A NAME="951"></A>though they may occupy bodies in the heavenly region, they are essentially 
<A NAME="952"></A>in the Intellectual: and very surely the deliberation of doubt and difficulty 
<A NAME="953"></A>which they practise here must be unknown to them There; all their act must 
<A NAME="954"></A>fall into place by sheer force of their nature; there can be no question 
<A NAME="955"></A>of commanding or of taking counsel; they will know, each, what is to be 
<A NAME="956"></A>communicated from another, by present consciousness. Even in our own case 
<A NAME="957"></A>here, eyes often know what is not spoken; and There all is pure, every 
<A NAME="958"></A>being is, as it were, an eye, nothing is concealed or sophisticated, there 
<A NAME="959"></A>is no need of speech, everything is seen and known. As for the Celestials 
<A NAME="960"></A>[the Daimones] and souls in the air, they may well use speech; for all 
<A NAME="961"></A>such are simply Animate [= Beings].
<A NAME="962"></A><BR><BR><B>19.</B> Are we to think of the indivisible phase of the soul 
<A NAME="963"></A>and the divided as making one thing in a coalescence; or is the indivisible 
<A NAME="964"></A>in a place of its own and under conditions of its own, the divisible being 
<A NAME="965"></A>a sequent upon it, a separate part of it, as distinct as the reasoning 
<A NAME="966"></A>phase is from the unreasoning?
<A NAME="967"></A><BR><BR>The answer to this question will emerge when we make plain the 
<A NAME="968"></A>nature and function to be attributed to each.
<A NAME="969"></A><BR><BR>The indivisible phase is mentioned [in the passage of Plato] without 
<A NAME="970"></A>further qualification; but not so the divisible; "that soul" we read "which 
<A NAME="971"></A>becomes divisible in bodies"- and even this last is presented as becoming 
<A NAME="972"></A>partible, not as being so once for all.
<A NAME="973"></A><BR><BR>"In bodies": we must then, satisfy ourselves as to what form of 
<A NAME="974"></A>soul is required to produce life in the corporeal, and what there must 
<A NAME="975"></A>be of soul present throughout such a body, such a completed 
<A NAME="976"></A>organism.
<A NAME="977"></A><BR><BR>Now, every sensitive power- by the fact of being sensitive throughout- 
<A NAME="978"></A>tends to become a thing of parts: present at every distinct point of sensitiveness, 
<A NAME="979"></A>it may be thought of as divided. In the sense, however, that it is present 
<A NAME="980"></A>as a whole at every such point, it cannot be said to be wholly divided; 
<A NAME="981"></A>it "becomes divisible in body." We may be told that no such partition is 
<A NAME="982"></A>implied in any sensations but those of touch; but this is not so; where 
<A NAME="983"></A>the participant is body [of itself insensitive and non-transmitting] that 
<A NAME="984"></A>divisibility in the sensitive agent will be a condition of all other sensations, 
<A NAME="985"></A>though in less degree than in the case of touch. Similarly the vegetative 
<A NAME="986"></A>function in the soul, with that of growth, indicates divisibility; and, 
<A NAME="987"></A>admitting such locations as that of desire at the liver and emotional activity 
<A NAME="988"></A>at the heart, we have the same result. It is to be noted, however, as regards 
<A NAME="989"></A>these [the less corporeal] sensations, that the body may possibly not experience 
<A NAME="990"></A>them as a fact of the conjoint thing but in another mode, as rising within 
<A NAME="991"></A>some one of the elements of which it has been participant [as inherent, 
<A NAME="992"></A>purely, in some phase of the associated soul]: reasoning and the act of 
<A NAME="993"></A>the intellect, for instance, are not vested in the body; their task is 
<A NAME="994"></A>not accomplished by means of the body which in fact is detrimental to any 
<A NAME="995"></A>thinking on which it is allowed to intrude.
<A NAME="996"></A><BR><BR>Thus the indivisible phase of the soul stands distinct from the 
<A NAME="997"></A>divisible; they do not form a unity, but, on the contrary, a whole consisting 
<A NAME="998"></A>of parts, each part a self-standing thing having its own peculiar virtue. 
<A NAME="999"></A>None the less, if that phase which becomes divisible in body holds indivisibility 
<A NAME="1000"></A>by communication from the superior power, then this one same thing [the 
<A NAME="1001"></A>soul in body] may be at once indivisible and divisible; it will be, as 
<A NAME="1002"></A>it were, a blend, a thing made up of its own divisible self with, in addition, 
<A NAME="1003"></A>the quality that it derives from above itself.
<A NAME="1004"></A><BR><BR><B>20.</B> Here a question rises to which we must find an answer: 
<A NAME="1005"></A>whether these and the other powers which we call "parts" of the Soul are 
<A NAME="1006"></A>situated, all, in place; or whether some have place and standpoint, others 
<A NAME="1007"></A>not; or whether again none are situated in place.
<A NAME="1008"></A><BR><BR>The matter is difficult: if we do not allot to each of the parts 
<A NAME="1009"></A>of the Soul some form of Place, but leave all unallocated- no more within 
<A NAME="1010"></A>the body than outside it- we leave the body soulless, and are at a loss 
<A NAME="1011"></A>to explain plausibly the origin of acts performed by means of the bodily 
<A NAME="1012"></A>organs: if, on the other hand, we suppose some of those phases to be [capable 
<A NAME="1013"></A>of situation] in place but others not so, we will be supposing that those 
<A NAME="1014"></A>parts to which we deny place are ineffective in us, or, in other words, 
<A NAME="1015"></A>that we do not possess our entire soul.
<A NAME="1016"></A><BR><BR>This simply shows that neither the soul entire nor any part of 
<A NAME="1017"></A>it may be considered to be within the body as in a space: space is a container, 
<A NAME="1018"></A>a container of body; it is the home of such things as consist of isolated 
<A NAME="1019"></A>parts, things, therefore, in which at no point is there an entirety; now, 
<A NAME="1020"></A>the soul is not a body and is no more contained than 
<A NAME="1021"></A>containing.
<A NAME="1022"></A><BR><BR>Neither is it in body as in some vessel: whether as vessel or as 
<A NAME="1023"></A>place of location, the body would remain, in itself, unensouled. If we 
<A NAME="1024"></A>are to think of some passing-over from the soul- that self-gathered thing- 
<A NAME="1025"></A>to the containing vessel, then soul is diminished by just as much as the 
<A NAME="1026"></A>vessel takes.
<A NAME="1027"></A><BR><BR>Space, again, in the strict sense is unembodied, and is not, itself, 
<A NAME="1028"></A>body; why, then, should it need soul?
<A NAME="1029"></A><BR><BR>Besides [if the soul were contained as in space] contact would 
<A NAME="1030"></A>be only at the surface of the body, not throughout the entire 
<A NAME="1031"></A>mass.
<A NAME="1032"></A><BR><BR>Many other considerations equally refute the notion that the soul 
<A NAME="1033"></A>is in body as [an object] in space; for example, this space would be shifted 
<A NAME="1034"></A>with every movement, and a thing itself would carry its own space 
<A NAME="1035"></A>about.
<A NAME="1036"></A><BR><BR>Of course if by space we understand the interval separating objects, 
<A NAME="1037"></A>it is still less possible that the soul be in body as in space: such a 
<A NAME="1038"></A>separating interval must be a void; but body is not a void; the void must 
<A NAME="1039"></A>be that in which body is placed; body [not soul] will be in the 
<A NAME="1040"></A>void.
<A NAME="1041"></A><BR><BR>Nor can it be in the body as in some substratum: anything in a 
<A NAME="1042"></A>substratum is a condition affecting that- a colour, a form- but the soul 
<A NAME="1043"></A>is a separate existence.
<A NAME="1044"></A><BR><BR>Nor is it present as a part in the whole; soul is no part of body. 
<A NAME="1045"></A>If we are asked to think of soul as a part in the living total we are faced 
<A NAME="1046"></A>with the old difficulty: How it is in that whole. It is certainly not there 
<A NAME="1047"></A>as the wine is in the wine jar, or as the jar in the jar, or as some absolute 
<A NAME="1048"></A>is self-present.
<A NAME="1049"></A><BR><BR>Nor can the presence be that of a whole in its part: It would be 
<A NAME="1050"></A>absurd to think of the soul as a total of which the body should represent 
<A NAME="1051"></A>the parts.
<A NAME="1052"></A><BR><BR>It is not present as Form is in Matter; for the Form as in Matter 
<A NAME="1053"></A>is inseparable and, further, is something superimposed upon an already 
<A NAME="1054"></A>existent thing; soul, on the contrary, is that which engenders the Form 
<A NAME="1055"></A>residing within the Matter and therefore is not the Form. If the reference 
<A NAME="1056"></A>is not to the Form actually present, but to Form as a thing existing apart 
<A NAME="1057"></A>from all formed objects, it is hard to see how such an entity has found 
<A NAME="1058"></A>its way into body, and at any rate this makes the soul 
<A NAME="1059"></A>separable.
<A NAME="1060"></A><BR><BR>How comes it then that everyone speaks of soul as being in 
<A NAME="1061"></A>body?
<A NAME="1062"></A><BR>Because the soul is not seen and the body is: we perceive the body, 
<A NAME="1063"></A>and by its movement and sensation we understand that it is ensouled, and 
<A NAME="1064"></A>we say that it possesses a soul; to speak of residence is a natural sequence. 
<A NAME="1065"></A>If the soul were visible, an object of the senses, radiating throughout 
<A NAME="1066"></A>the entire life, if it were manifest in full force to the very outermost 
<A NAME="1067"></A>surface, we would no longer speak of soul as in body; we would say the 
<A NAME="1068"></A>minor was within the major, the contained within the container, the fleeting 
<A NAME="1069"></A>within the perdurable.
<A NAME="1070"></A><BR><BR><B>21.</B> What does all this come to? What answer do we give to 
<A NAME="1071"></A>him who, with no opinion of his own to assert, asks us to explain this 
<A NAME="1072"></A>presence? And what do we say to the question whether there is one only 
<A NAME="1073"></A>mode of presence of the entire soul or different modes, phase and 
<A NAME="1074"></A>phase?
<A NAME="1075"></A><BR><BR>Of the modes currently accepted for the presence of one thing in 
<A NAME="1076"></A>another, none really meets the case of the soul's relation to the body. 
<A NAME="1077"></A>Thus we are given as a parallel the steersman in the ship; this serves 
<A NAME="1078"></A>adequately to indicate that the soul is potentially separable, but the 
<A NAME="1079"></A>mode of presence, which is what we are seeking, it does not 
<A NAME="1080"></A>exhibit.
<A NAME="1081"></A><BR><BR>We can imagine it within the body in some incidental way- for example, 
<A NAME="1082"></A>as a voyager in a ship- but scarcely as the steersman: and, of course, 
<A NAME="1083"></A>too, the steersman is not omnipresent to the ship as the soul is to the 
<A NAME="1084"></A>body.
<A NAME="1085"></A><BR><BR>May we, perhaps, compare it to the science or skill that acts through 
<A NAME="1086"></A>its appropriate instruments- through a helm, let us say, which should happen 
<A NAME="1087"></A>to be a live thing- so that the soul effecting the movements dictated by 
<A NAME="1088"></A>seamanship is an indwelling directive force?
<A NAME="1089"></A><BR><BR>No: the comparison breaks down, since the science is something 
<A NAME="1090"></A>outside of helm and ship.
<A NAME="1091"></A><BR><BR>Is it any help to adopt the illustration of the steersman taking 
<A NAME="1092"></A>the helm, and to station the soul within the body as the steersman may 
<A NAME="1093"></A>be thought to be within the material instrument through which he works? 
<A NAME="1094"></A>Soul, whenever and wherever it chooses to operate, does in much that way 
<A NAME="1095"></A>move the body.
<A NAME="1096"></A><BR><BR>No; even in this parallel we have no explanation of the mode of 
<A NAME="1097"></A>presence within the instrument; we cannot be satisfied without further 
<A NAME="1098"></A>search, a closer approach.
<A NAME="1099"></A><BR><BR><B>22.</B> May we think that the mode of the soul's presence to 
<A NAME="1100"></A>body is that of the presence of light to the air?
<A NAME="1101"></A><BR><BR>This certainly is presence with distinction: the light penetrates 
<A NAME="1102"></A>through and through, but nowhere coalesces; the light is the stable thing, 
<A NAME="1103"></A>the air flows in and out; when the air passes beyond the lit area it is 
<A NAME="1104"></A>dark; under the light it is lit: we have a true parallel to what we have 
<A NAME="1105"></A>been saying of body and soul, for the air is in the light quite as much 
<A NAME="1106"></A>as the light in the air.
<A NAME="1107"></A><BR><BR>Plato therefore is wise when, in treating of the All, he puts the 
<A NAME="1108"></A>body in its soul, and not its soul in the body, and says that, while there 
<A NAME="1109"></A>is a region of that soul which contains body, there is another region to 
<A NAME="1110"></A>which body does not enter- certain powers, that is, with which body has 
<A NAME="1111"></A>no concern. And what is true of the All-Soul is true of the 
<A NAME="1112"></A>others.
<A NAME="1113"></A><BR><BR>There are, therefore, certain soul-powers whose presence to body 
<A NAME="1114"></A>must be denied.
<A NAME="1115"></A><BR><BR>The phases present are those which the nature of body demands: 
<A NAME="1116"></A>they are present without being resident- either in any parts of the body 
<A NAME="1117"></A>or in the body as a whole.
<A NAME="1118"></A><BR><BR>For the purposes of sensation the sensitive phase of the soul is 
<A NAME="1119"></A>present to the entire sensitive being: for the purposes of act, differentiation 
<A NAME="1120"></A>begins; every soul phase operates at a point peculiar to 
<A NAME="1121"></A>itself.
<A NAME="1122"></A><BR><BR><B>23.</B> I explain: A living body is illuminated by soul: each 
<A NAME="1123"></A>organ and member participates in soul after some manner peculiar to itself; 
<A NAME="1124"></A>the organ is adapted to a certain function, and this fitness is the vehicle 
<A NAME="1125"></A>of the soul-faculty under which the function is performed; thus the seeing 
<A NAME="1126"></A>faculty acts through the eyes, the hearing faculty through the ears, the 
<A NAME="1127"></A>tasting faculty through the tongue, the faculty of smelling through the 
<A NAME="1128"></A>nostrils, and the faculty of sentient touch is present throughout, since 
<A NAME="1129"></A>in this particular form of perception the entire body is an instrument 
<A NAME="1130"></A>in the soul's service.
<A NAME="1131"></A><BR><BR>The vehicles of touch are mainly centred in the nerves- which moreover 
<A NAME="1132"></A>are vehicles of the faculty by which the movements of the living being 
<A NAME="1133"></A>are affected- in them the soul-faculty concerned makes itself present; 
<A NAME="1134"></A>the nerves start from the brain. The brain therefore has been considered 
<A NAME="1135"></A>as the centre and seat of the principle which determines feeling and impulse 
<A NAME="1136"></A>and the entire act of the organism as a living thing; where the instruments 
<A NAME="1137"></A>are found to be linked, there the operating faculty is assumed to be situated. 
<A NAME="1138"></A>But it would be wiser to say only that there is situated the first activity
