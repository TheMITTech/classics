<A NAME="10"></A><B>First Tractate</B>
<A NAME="11"></A><BR><BR><B>ON THE KINDS OF BEING- (1).</B>
<A NAME="12"></A><BR><BR><B>1.</B> Philosophy at a very early stage investigated the number 
<A NAME="13"></A>and character of the Existents. Various theories resulted: some declared 
<A NAME="14"></A>for one Existent, others for a finite number, others again for an infinite 
<A NAME="15"></A>number, while as regards the nature of the Existents- one, numerically 
<A NAME="16"></A>finite, or numerically infinite- there was a similar disagreement. These 
<A NAME="17"></A>theories, in so far as they have been adequately examined by later workers, 
<A NAME="18"></A>may be passed over here; our attention must be directed upon the results 
<A NAME="19"></A>of those whose examination has led them to posit on their awn account certain 
<A NAME="20"></A>well-defined genera.
<A NAME="21"></A><BR><BR>These thinkers rejected pure unity on the ground of the plurality 
<A NAME="22"></A>observed even in the Intellectual world; they rejected an infinite number 
<A NAME="23"></A>as not reconcilable with the facts and as defying knowledge: considering 
<A NAME="24"></A>the foundations of being to be "genera" rather than elements strictly so 
<A NAME="25"></A>called, they concluded for a finite number. Of these "genera" some found 
<A NAME="26"></A>ten, others less, others no doubt more.
<A NAME="27"></A><BR><BR>But here again there is a divergence of views. To some the genera 
<A NAME="28"></A>are first-principles; to others they indicate only a generic classification 
<A NAME="29"></A>of the Existents themselves.
<A NAME="30"></A><BR><BR>Let us begin with the well-known tenfold division of the Existents, 
<A NAME="31"></A>and consider whether we are to understand ten genera ranged under the common 
<A NAME="32"></A>name of Being, or ten categories. That the term Being has not the same 
<A NAME="33"></A>sense in all ten is rightly maintained.
<A NAME="34"></A><BR><BR>But a graver problem confronts us at the outset: Are the ten found 
<A NAME="35"></A>alike in the Intellectual and in the Sensible realms? Or are all found 
<A NAME="36"></A>in the Sensible and some only in the Intellectual? All in the Intellectual 
<A NAME="37"></A>and some in the Sensible is manifestly impossible.
<A NAME="38"></A><BR><BR>At this point it would be natural to investigate which of the ten 
<A NAME="39"></A>belong to both spheres, and whether the Existents of the Intellectual are 
<A NAME="40"></A>to be ranged under one and the same genus with the Existents in the Sensible, 
<A NAME="41"></A>or whether the term "Existence" [or Substance] is equivocal as applied 
<A NAME="42"></A>to both realms. If the equivocation exists, the number of genera will be 
<A NAME="43"></A>increased: if there is no equivocation, it is strange to find the one same 
<A NAME="44"></A>"Existence" applying to the primary and to the derivative Existents when 
<A NAME="45"></A>there is no common genus embracing both primal and secondary.
<A NAME="46"></A><BR><BR>These thinkers are however not considering the Intellectual realm 
<A NAME="47"></A>in their division, which was not intended to cover all the Existents; the 
<A NAME="48"></A>Supreme they overlooked.
<A NAME="49"></A><BR><BR><B>2.</B> But are we really obliged to posit the existence of such 
<A NAME="50"></A>genera?
<A NAME="51"></A><BR><BR>Take Substance, for Substance must certainly be our starting-point: 
<A NAME="52"></A>what are the grounds for regarding Substance as one single 
<A NAME="53"></A>genus?
<A NAME="54"></A><BR><BR>It has been remarked that Substance cannot be a single entity common 
<A NAME="55"></A>to both the Intellectual and the Sensible worlds. We may add that such 
<A NAME="56"></A>community would entail the existence of something prior to Intellectual 
<A NAME="57"></A>and Sensible Substances alike, something distinct from both as predicated 
<A NAME="58"></A>of both; and this prior would be neither body nor unembodied; for it were 
<A NAME="59"></A>one or the other, body would be unembodied, or the unembodied would be 
<A NAME="60"></A>the body.
<A NAME="61"></A><BR><BR>This conclusion must not however prevent our seeking in the actual 
<A NAME="62"></A>substance of the Sensible world an element held in common by Matter, by 
<A NAME="63"></A>Form and by their Composite, all of which are designated as substances, 
<A NAME="64"></A>though it is not maintained that they are Substance in an equal degree; 
<A NAME="65"></A>Form is usually held to be Substance in a higher degree than Matter, and 
<A NAME="66"></A>rightly so, in spite of those who would have Matter to be the more truly 
<A NAME="67"></A>real.
<A NAME="68"></A><BR><BR>There is further the distinction drawn between what are known as 
<A NAME="69"></A>First and Second Substances. But what is their common basis, seeing that 
<A NAME="70"></A>the First are the source from which the Second derive their right to be 
<A NAME="71"></A>called substances?
<A NAME="72"></A><BR><BR>But, in sum, it is impossible to define Substance: determine its 
<A NAME="73"></A>property, and still you have not attained to its essence. Even the definition, 
<A NAME="74"></A>"That which, numerically one and the same, is receptive of contraries," 
<A NAME="75"></A>will hardly be applicable to all substances alike.
<A NAME="76"></A><BR><BR><B>3.</B> But perhaps we should rather speak of some single category, 
<A NAME="77"></A>embracing Intellectual Substance, Matter, Form, and the Composite of Matter 
<A NAME="78"></A>and Form. One might refer to the family of the Heraclids as a unity in 
<A NAME="79"></A>the sense, not of a common element in all its members, but of a common 
<A NAME="80"></A>origin: similarly, Intellectual Substance would be Substance in the first 
<A NAME="81"></A>degree, the others being substances by derivation and in a lower 
<A NAME="82"></A>degree.
<A NAME="83"></A><BR><BR>But what is the objection to including everything in a single category, 
<A NAME="84"></A>all else of which existence is predicated being derived from that one thing, 
<A NAME="85"></A>Existence or Substance? Because, granted that things be no more than modifications 
<A NAME="86"></A>of Substance, there is a distinct grading of substances themselves. Moreover, 
<A NAME="87"></A>the single category does not put us in a position to build on Substance, 
<A NAME="88"></A>or to grasp it in its very truth as the plausible source of the other 
<A NAME="89"></A>substances.
<A NAME="90"></A><BR><BR>Supposing we grant that all things known as substances are homogeneous 
<A NAME="91"></A>as possessing something denied to the other genera, what precisely is this 
<A NAME="92"></A>something, this individuality, this subject which is never a predicate, 
<A NAME="93"></A>this thing not present in any thing as in a subject, this thing which does 
<A NAME="94"></A>not owe its essential character to any other thing, as a quality takes 
<A NAME="95"></A>character from a body and a quantity from a substance, as time is related 
<A NAME="96"></A>to motion and motion to the moved?
<A NAME="97"></A><BR><BR>The Second Substance is, it is true, a predicate. But predication 
<A NAME="98"></A>in this case signifies a different relation from that just considered; 
<A NAME="99"></A>it reveals the genus inherent in the subject and the subject's essential 
<A NAME="100"></A>character, whereas whiteness is predicated of a thing in the sense of being 
<A NAME="101"></A>present in the thing.
<A NAME="102"></A><BR><BR>The properties adduced may indeed be allowed to distinguish Substance 
<A NAME="103"></A>from the other Existents. They afford a means of grouping substances together 
<A NAME="104"></A>and calling them by a common name. They do not however establish the unity 
<A NAME="105"></A>of a genus, and they do not bring to light the concept and the nature of 
<A NAME="106"></A>Substance.
<A NAME="107"></A><BR><BR>These considerations are sufficient for our purpose: let us now 
<A NAME="108"></A>proceed to investigate the nature of Quantity.
<A NAME="109"></A><BR><BR><B>4.</B> We are told that number is Quantity in the primary sense, 
<A NAME="110"></A>number together with all continuous magnitude, space and time: these are 
<A NAME="111"></A>the standards to which all else that is considered as Quantity is referred, 
<A NAME="112"></A>including motion which is Quantity because its time is quantitative- though 
<A NAME="113"></A>perhaps, conversely, the time takes its continuity from the 
<A NAME="114"></A>motion.
<A NAME="115"></A><BR><BR>If it is maintained that the continuous is a Quantity by the fact 
<A NAME="116"></A>of its continuity, then the discrete will not be a Quantity. If, on the 
<A NAME="117"></A>contrary, the continuous possesses Quantity as an accident, what is there 
<A NAME="118"></A>common to both continuous and discrete to make them 
<A NAME="119"></A>quantities?
<A NAME="120"></A><BR><BR>Suppose we concede that numbers are quantities: we are merely allowing 
<A NAME="121"></A>them the name of quantity; the principle which gives them this name remains 
<A NAME="122"></A>obscure.
<A NAME="123"></A><BR><BR>On the other hand, line and surface and body are not called quantities; 
<A NAME="124"></A>they are called magnitudes: they become known as quantities only when they 
<A NAME="125"></A>are rated by number-two yards, three yards. Even the natural body becomes 
<A NAME="126"></A>a quantity when measured, as does the space which it occupies; but this 
<A NAME="127"></A>is quantity accidental, not quantity essential; what we seek to grasp is 
<A NAME="128"></A>not accidental quantity but Quantity independent and essential, Quantity-Absolute. 
<A NAME="129"></A>Three oxen is not a quantity; it is their number, the three, that is Quantity; 
<A NAME="130"></A>for in three oxen we are dealing with two categories. So too with a line 
<A NAME="131"></A>of a stated length, a surface of a given area; the area will be a quantity 
<A NAME="132"></A>but not the surface, which only comes under that category when it constitutes 
<A NAME="133"></A>a definite geometric figure.
<A NAME="134"></A><BR><BR>Are we then to consider numbers, and numbers only, as constituting 
<A NAME="135"></A>the category of Quantity? If we mean numbers in themselves, they are substances, 
<A NAME="136"></A>for the very good reason that they exist independently. If we mean numbers 
<A NAME="137"></A>displayed in the objects participant in number, the numbers which give 
<A NAME="138"></A>the count of the objects- ten horses or ten oxen, and not ten units- then 
<A NAME="139"></A>we have a paradoxical result: first, the numbers in themselves, it would 
<A NAME="140"></A>appear, are substances but the numbers in objects are not; and secondly, 
<A NAME="141"></A>the numbers inhere in the objects as measures [of extension or weight], 
<A NAME="142"></A>yet as standing outside the objects they have no measuring power, as do 
<A NAME="143"></A>rulers and scales. If however their existence is independent, and they 
<A NAME="144"></A>do not inhere in the objects, but are simply called in for the purpose 
<A NAME="145"></A>of measurement, the objects will be quantities only to the extent of participating 
<A NAME="146"></A>in Quantity.
<A NAME="147"></A><BR><BR>So with the numbers themselves: how can they constitute the category 
<A NAME="148"></A>of Quantity? They are measures; but how do measures come to be quantities 
<A NAME="149"></A>or Quantity? Doubtless in that, existing as they do among the Existents 
<A NAME="150"></A>and not being adapted to any of the other categories, they find their place 
<A NAME="151"></A>under the influence of verbal suggestion and so are referred to the so-called 
<A NAME="152"></A>category of Quantity. We see the unit mark off one measurement and then 
<A NAME="153"></A>proceed to another; and number thus reveals the amount of a thing, and 
<A NAME="154"></A>the mind measures by availing itself of the total figure.
<A NAME="155"></A><BR><BR>It follows that in measuring it is not measuring essence; it pronounces 
<A NAME="156"></A>its "one" or "two," whatever the character of the objects, even summing 
<A NAME="157"></A>contraries. It does not take count of condition- hot, handsome; it simply 
<A NAME="158"></A>notes how many.
<A NAME="159"></A><BR><BR>Number then, whether regarded in itself or in the participant objects, 
<A NAME="160"></A>belongs to the category of Quantity, but the participant objects do not. 
<A NAME="161"></A>"Three yards long" does not fall under the category of Quantity, but only 
<A NAME="162"></A>the three.
<A NAME="163"></A><BR><BR>Why then are magnitudes classed as quantities? Not because they 
<A NAME="164"></A>are so in the strict sense, but because they approximate to Quantity, and 
<A NAME="165"></A>because objects in which magnitudes inhere are themselves designated as 
<A NAME="166"></A>quantities. We call a thing great or small from its participation in a 
<A NAME="167"></A>high number or a low. True, greatness and smallness are not claimed to 
<A NAME="168"></A>be quantities, but relations: but it is by their apparent possession of 
<A NAME="169"></A>quantity that they are thought of as relations. All this, however, needs 
<A NAME="170"></A>more careful examination.
<A NAME="171"></A><BR><BR>In sum, we hold that there is no single genus of Quantity. Only 
<A NAME="172"></A>number is Quantity, the rest [magnitudes, space, time, motion] quantities 
<A NAME="173"></A>only in a secondary degree. We have therefore not strictly one genus, but 
<A NAME="174"></A>one category grouping the approximate with the primary and the 
<A NAME="175"></A>secondary.
<A NAME="176"></A><BR><BR>We have however to enquire in what sense the abstract numbers are 
<A NAME="177"></A>substances. Can it be that they are also in a manner quantitative? Into 
<A NAME="178"></A>whatever category they fall, the other numbers [those inherent in objects] 
<A NAME="179"></A>can have nothing in common with them but the name. 5. Speech, time, motion- 
<A NAME="180"></A>in what sense are these quantities?
<A NAME="181"></A><BR><BR>Let us begin with speech. It is subject to measurement, but only 
<A NAME="182"></A>in so far as it is sound; it is not a quantity in its essential nature, 
<A NAME="183"></A>which nature is that it be significant, as noun and verb are significant. 
<A NAME="184"></A>The air is its Matter, as it is Matter to verb and noun, the components 
<A NAME="185"></A>of speech.
<A NAME="186"></A><BR><BR>To be more precise, we may define speech as an impact [made upon 
<A NAME="187"></A>the outer air by the breath], though it is not so much the impact as the 
<A NAME="188"></A>impression which the impact produces and which, as it were, imposes Form 
<A NAME="189"></A>[upon the air]. Speech, thus, is rather an action than a quantity- an action 
<A NAME="190"></A>with a significance. Though perhaps it would be truer to say that while 
<A NAME="191"></A>this motion, this impact, is an action, the counter-motion is an experience 
<A NAME="192"></A>[or Passion]; or each may be from different points of view either an action 
<A NAME="193"></A>or an experience: or we may think of speech as action upon a substrate 
<A NAME="194"></A>[air] and experience within that substrate.
<A NAME="195"></A><BR><BR>If however voice is not characteristically impact, but is simply 
<A NAME="196"></A>air, two categories will be involved: voice is significant, and the one 
<A NAME="197"></A>category will not be sufficient to account for this significance without 
<A NAME="198"></A>associating with a second.
<A NAME="199"></A><BR><BR>With regard to time, if it is to be thought of as a measure, we 
<A NAME="200"></A>must determine what it is that applies this measure. It must clearly be 
<A NAME="201"></A>either Soul or the Present Moment. If on the contrary we take time to be 
<A NAME="202"></A>something measured and regard it as being of such and such extension- a 
<A NAME="203"></A>year, for example- then we may consider it as a quantity: essentially however 
<A NAME="204"></A>time is of a different nature; the very fact that we can attribute this 
<A NAME="205"></A>or that length to it shows us that it is not length: in other words, time 
<A NAME="206"></A>is not Quantity. Quantity in the strict sense is the Quantity not inbound 
<A NAME="207"></A>with things; if things became quantities by mere participation in Quantity, 
<A NAME="208"></A>then Substance itself would be identical with Quantity.
<A NAME="209"></A><BR><BR>Equality and inequality must be regarded as properties of Quantity-Absolute, 
<A NAME="210"></A>not of the participants, or of them not essentially but only accidentally: 
<A NAME="211"></A>such participants as "three yards' length," which becomes a quantity, not 
<A NAME="212"></A>as belonging to a single genus of Quantity, but by being subsumed under 
<A NAME="213"></A>the one head, the one category.
<A NAME="214"></A><BR><BR><B>6.</B> In considering Relation we must enquire whether it possesses 
<A NAME="215"></A>the community of a genus, or whether it may on other grounds be treated 
<A NAME="216"></A>as a unity.
<A NAME="217"></A><BR><BR>Above all, has Relation- for example, that of right and left, double 
<A NAME="218"></A>and half- any actuality? Has it, perhaps, actuality in some cases only, 
<A NAME="219"></A>as for instance in what is termed "posterior" but not in what is termed 
<A NAME="220"></A>"prior"? Or is its actuality in no case conceivable?
<A NAME="221"></A><BR><BR>What meaning, then, are we to attach to double and half and all 
<A NAME="222"></A>other cases of less and more; to habit and disposition, reclining, sitting, 
<A NAME="223"></A>standing; to father, son, master, slave; to like, unlike, equal, unequal; 
<A NAME="224"></A>to active and passive, measure and measured; or again to knowledge and 
<A NAME="225"></A>sensation, as related respectively to the knowable and the 
<A NAME="226"></A>sensible?
<A NAME="227"></A><BR><BR>Knowledge, indeed, may be supposed to entail in relation to the 
<A NAME="228"></A>known object some actual entity corresponding to that object's Ideal Form, 
<A NAME="229"></A>and similarly with sensation as related to the sense-object. The active 
<A NAME="230"></A>will perform some constant function in relation to the passive, as will 
<A NAME="231"></A>the measure in relation to the measured.
<A NAME="232"></A><BR><BR>But what will emerge from the relation of like to like? Nothing 
<A NAME="233"></A>will emerge. Likeness is the inherence of qualitative identity; its entire 
<A NAME="234"></A>content is the quality present in the two objects.
<A NAME="235"></A><BR><BR>From equality, similarly, nothing emerges. The relation merely 
<A NAME="236"></A>presupposes the existence of a quantitative identity;- is nothing but our 
<A NAME="237"></A>judgement comparing objects essentially independent and concluding, "This 
<A NAME="238"></A>and that have the same magnitude, the same quality; this has produced that; 
<A NAME="239"></A>this is superior to that."
<A NAME="240"></A><BR><BR>Again, what meaning can sitting and standing have apart from sitter 
<A NAME="241"></A>and stander? The term "habit" either implies a having, in which case it 
<A NAME="242"></A>signifies possession, or else it arises from something had, and so denotes 
<A NAME="243"></A>quality; and similarly with disposition.
<A NAME="244"></A><BR><BR>What then in these instances can be the meaning of correlatives 
<A NAME="245"></A>apart from our conception of their juxtaposition? "Greater" may refer to 
<A NAME="246"></A>very different magnitudes; "different" to all sorts of objects: the comparison 
<A NAME="247"></A>is ours; it does not lie in the things themselves.
<A NAME="248"></A><BR><BR>Right and left, before and behind, would seem to belong less to 
<A NAME="249"></A>the category of Relation than to that of Situation. Right means "situated 
<A NAME="250"></A>at one point," left means "situated at another." But the right and left 
<A NAME="251"></A>are in our conception, nothing of them in the things 
<A NAME="252"></A>themselves.
<A NAME="253"></A><BR><BR>Before and after are merely two times; the relation is again of 
<A NAME="254"></A>our making.
<A NAME="255"></A><BR><BR><B>7.</B> Now if we do not mean anything by Relation but are victims 
<A NAME="256"></A>of words, none of the relations mentioned can exist: Relation will be a 
<A NAME="257"></A>notion void of content.
<A NAME="258"></A><BR><BR>Suppose however that we do possess ourselves of objective truth 
<A NAME="259"></A>when in comparing two points of time we pronounce one prior, or posterior, 
<A NAME="260"></A>to the other, that priority does entail something distinct from the objects 
<A NAME="261"></A>to which it refers; admit an objective truth behind the relation of left 
<A NAME="262"></A>and right: does this apply also to magnitudes, and is the relation exhibiting 
<A NAME="263"></A>excess and deficiency also something distinct from the quantities 
<A NAME="264"></A>involved?
<A NAME="265"></A><BR><BR>Now one thing is double of another quite apart from our speech 
<A NAME="266"></A>or thought; one thing possesses and another is possessed before we notice 
<A NAME="267"></A>the fact; equals do not await our comparison but- and this applies to Quality 
<A NAME="268"></A>as well as Quantity- rest upon an identity existing between the objects 
<A NAME="269"></A>compared: in all the conditions in which we assert Relation the mutual 
<A NAME="270"></A>relation exists over and above the objects; we perceive it as already existent; 
<A NAME="271"></A>our knowledge is directed upon a thing, there to be known- a clear testimony 
<A NAME="272"></A>to the reality of Relation.
<A NAME="273"></A><BR><BR>In these circumstances we can no longer put the question of its 
<A NAME="274"></A>existence. We have simply to distinguish: sometimes the relation subsists 
<A NAME="275"></A>while the objects remain unaltered and even apart; sometimes it depends 
<A NAME="276"></A>upon their combination; sometimes, while they remain unchanged, the relation 
<A NAME="277"></A>utterly ceases, or, as happens with right and near, becomes different. 
<A NAME="278"></A>These are the facts which chiefly account for the notion that Relation 
<A NAME="279"></A>has no reality in such circumstances.
<A NAME="280"></A><BR><BR>Our task, thus, is to give full value to this elusive character 
<A NAME="281"></A>of Relation, and, then to enquire what there is that is constant in all 
<A NAME="282"></A>these particular cases and whether this constant is generic or accidental; 
<A NAME="283"></A>and having found this constant, we must discover what sort of actuality 
<A NAME="284"></A>it possesses.
<A NAME="285"></A><BR><BR>It need hardly be said that we are not to affirm Relation where 
<A NAME="286"></A>one thing is simply an attribute of another, as a habit is an attribute 
<A NAME="287"></A>of a soul or of a body; it is not Relation when a soul belongs to this 
<A NAME="288"></A>individual or dwells in that body. Relation enters only when the actuality 
<A NAME="289"></A>of the relationships is derived from no other source than Relation itself; 
<A NAME="290"></A>the actuality must be, not that which is characteristic of the substances 
<A NAME="291"></A>in question, but that which is specifically called relative. Thus double 
<A NAME="292"></A>with its correlative, half gives actuality neither to two yards' length 
<A NAME="293"></A>or the number two, nor to one yard's length or the number one; what happens 
<A NAME="294"></A>is that, when these quantities are viewed in their relation, they are found 
<A NAME="295"></A>to be not merely two and one respectively, but to produce the assertion 
<A NAME="296"></A>and to exhibit the fact of standing one to the other in the condition of 
<A NAME="297"></A>double and half. Out of the objects in a certain conjunction this condition 
<A NAME="298"></A>of being double and half has issued as something distinct from either; 
<A NAME="299"></A>double and half have emerged as correlatives, and their being is precisely 
<A NAME="300"></A>this of mutual dependence; the double exists by its superiority over the 
<A NAME="301"></A>half, and the half by its inferiority; there is no priority to distinguish 
<A NAME="302"></A>double from half; they arise simultaneously.
<A NAME="303"></A><BR><BR>It is another question whether they endure simultaneously. Take 
<A NAME="304"></A>the case of father and son, and such relationships; the father dies, but 
<A NAME="305"></A>the other is still his son, and so with brothers. Moreover, we see likeness 
<A NAME="306"></A>where one of the like people is dead.
<A NAME="307"></A><BR><BR><B>8.</B> But we are digressing: we must resume our enquiry into 
<A NAME="308"></A>the cause of dissimilarity among relations. Yet we must first be informed 
<A NAME="309"></A>what reality, common to all cases, is possessed by this Existence derived 
<A NAME="310"></A>from mutual conditions.
<A NAME="311"></A><BR><BR>Now the common principle in question cannot be a body. The only 
<A NAME="312"></A>alternative is that, if it does exist, it be something bodiless, either 
<A NAME="313"></A>in the objects thus brought together or outside of them.
<A NAME="314"></A><BR><BR>Further, if Relation always takes the same form, the term is univocal 
<A NAME="315"></A>[and specific differentiation is impossible]; if not, that is if it differs 
<A NAME="316"></A>from case to case, the term is equivocal, and the same reality will not 
<A NAME="317"></A>necessarily be implied by the mere use of the term Relation.
<A NAME="318"></A><BR><BR>How then shall we distinguish relations? We may observe that some 
<A NAME="319"></A>things have an inactive or dormant relation, with which their actuality 
<A NAME="320"></A>is entirely simultaneous; others, combining power and function with their 
<A NAME="321"></A>relation, have the relation in some mode always even though the mode be 
<A NAME="322"></A>merely that of potentiality, but attain to actual being only in contact 
<A NAME="323"></A>with their correlatives. Or perhaps all distinctions may be reduced to 
<A NAME="324"></A>that between producer and product, where the product merely gives a name 
<A NAME="325"></A>to the producer of its actuality: an example of this is the relation of 
<A NAME="326"></A>father to son, though here both producer and product have a sort of actuality, 
<A NAME="327"></A>which we call life.
<A NAME="328"></A><BR><BR>Are we thus, then, to divide Relation, and thereby reject the notion 
<A NAME="329"></A>of an identical common element in the different kinds of Relation, making 
<A NAME="330"></A>it a universal rule that the relation takes a different character in either 
<A NAME="331"></A>correlative? We must in this case recognise that in our distinction between 
<A NAME="332"></A>productive and non-productive relations we are overlooking the equivocation 
<A NAME="333"></A>involved in making the terms cover both action and passion, as though these 
<A NAME="334"></A>two were one, and ignoring the fact that production takes a different form 
<A NAME="335"></A>in the two correlatives. Take the case of equality, producing equals: nothing 
<A NAME="336"></A>is equal without equality, nothing identical without identity. Greatness 
<A NAME="337"></A>and smallness both entail a presence- the presence of greatness and smallness 
<A NAME="338"></A>respectively. When we come to greater and smaller, the participants in 
<A NAME="339"></A>these relations are greater and smaller only when greatness and smallness 
<A NAME="340"></A>are actually observed in them.
<A NAME="341"></A><BR><BR><B>9.</B> It follows that in the cases specified above- agent, 
<A NAME="342"></A>knowledge and the rest- the relation must be considered as in actual operation, 
<A NAME="343"></A>and the Act and the Reason-Principle in the Act must be assumed to be real: 
<A NAME="344"></A>in all other cases there will be simply participation in an Ideal-Form, 
<A NAME="345"></A>in a Reason-Principle.
<A NAME="346"></A><BR><BR>If Reality implied embodiment, we should indeed be forced to deny 
<A NAME="347"></A>Reality to these conditions called relative; if however we accord the pre-eminent 
<A NAME="348"></A>place to the unembodied and to the Reason-Principles, and at the same time 
<A NAME="349"></A>maintain that relations are Reason-Principles and participate in Ideal-Forms, 
<A NAME="350"></A>we are bound to seek their causes in that higher sphere. Doubleness, it 
<A NAME="351"></A>is clear, is the cause of a thing being double, and from it is derived 
<A NAME="352"></A>halfness.
<A NAME="353"></A><BR><BR>Some correlatives owe their designations to the same Form, others 
<A NAME="354"></A>to opposite Forms; it is thus that two objects are simultaneously double 
<A NAME="355"></A>and half of each other, and one great and the other small. It may happen 
<A NAME="356"></A>that both correlatives exist in one object-likeness and unlikeness, and, 
<A NAME="357"></A>in general, identity and difference, so that the same thing will be at 
<A NAME="358"></A>once like and unlike, identical and different.
<A NAME="359"></A><BR><BR>The question arises here whether sharing in the same Form could 
<A NAME="360"></A>make one man depraved and another more depraved. In the case of total depravity, 
<A NAME="361"></A>clearly the two are made equal by the absence of a Form. Where there is 
<A NAME="362"></A>a difference of degree, the one has participated in a Form which has failed 
<A NAME="363"></A>to predominate, the other in a Form which has failed still more: or, if 
<A NAME="364"></A>we choose the negative aspect, we may think of them both as failing to 
<A NAME="365"></A>participate in a Form which naturally belonged to them.
<A NAME="366"></A><BR><BR>Sensation may be regarded as a Form of double origin [determined 
<A NAME="367"></A>both by the sense-organ and by the sensible object]; and similarly with 
<A NAME="368"></A>knowledge.
<A NAME="369"></A><BR><BR>Habit is an Act directed upon something had [some experience produced 
<A NAME="370"></A>by habit] and binding it as it were with the subject having [experiencing], 
<A NAME="371"></A>as the Act of production binds producer and product.
<A NAME="372"></A><BR><BR>Measurement is an Act of the measurer upon the measured object: 
<A NAME="373"></A>it too is therefore a kind of Reason-Principle.
<A NAME="374"></A><BR><BR>Now if the condition of being related is regarded as a Form having 
<A NAME="375"></A>a generic unity, Relation must be allowed to be a single genus owing its 
<A NAME="376"></A>reality to a Reason-Principle involved in all instances. If however the 
<A NAME="377"></A>Reason-Principles [governing the correlatives] stand opposed and have the 
<A NAME="378"></A>differences to which we have referred, there may perhaps not be a single 
<A NAME="379"></A>genus, but this will not prevent all relatives being expressed in terms 
<A NAME="380"></A>of a certain likeness and falling under a single category.
<A NAME="381"></A><BR><BR>But even if the cases of which we have spoken can be subsumed under 
<A NAME="382"></A>a single head, it is nevertheless impossible to include in a single genus 
<A NAME="383"></A>all that goes with them in the one common category: for the category includes 
<A NAME="384"></A>negations and derivatives- not only, for example, double but also its negative, 
<A NAME="385"></A>the resultant doubleness and the act of doubling. But we cannot include 
<A NAME="386"></A>in one genus both the thing and its negative- double and not-double, relative 
<A NAME="387"></A>and not-relative- any more than in dealing with the genus animal we can 
<A NAME="388"></A>insert in it the nonanimal. Moreover, doubleness and doubling have only 
<A NAME="389"></A>the relation to double that whiteness has to white; they cannot be classed 
<A NAME="390"></A>as identical with it.
<A NAME="391"></A><BR><BR><B>10.</B> As regards Quality, the source of what we call a "quale," 
<A NAME="392"></A>we must in the first place consider what nature it possesses in accordance 
<A NAME="393"></A>with which it produces the "qualia," and whether, remaining one and the 
<A NAME="394"></A>same in virtue of that common ground, it has also differences whereby it 
<A NAME="395"></A>produces the variety of species. If there is no common ground and the term 
<A NAME="396"></A>Quality involves many connotations, there cannot be a single genus of 
<A NAME="397"></A>Quality.
<A NAME="398"></A><BR><BR>What then will be the common ground in habit, disposition, passive 
<A NAME="399"></A>quality, figure, shape? In light, thick and lean?
<A NAME="400"></A><BR><BR>If we hold this common ground to be a power adapting itself to 
<A NAME="401"></A>the forms of habits, dispositions and physical capacities, a power which 
<A NAME="402"></A>gives the possessor whatever capacities he has, we have no plausible explanation 
<A NAME="403"></A>of incapacities. Besides, how are figure and the shape of a given thing 
<A NAME="404"></A>to be regarded as a power?
<A NAME="405"></A><BR><BR>Moreover, at this, Being will have no power qua Being but only 
<A NAME="406"></A>when Quality has been added to it; and the activities of those substances 
<A NAME="407"></A>which are activities in the highest degree, will be traceable to Quality, 
<A NAME="408"></A>although they are autonomous and owe their essential character to powers 
<A NAME="409"></A>wholly their own!
<A NAME="410"></A><BR><BR>Perhaps, however, qualities are conditioned by powers which are 
<A NAME="411"></A>posterior to the substances as such [and so do not interfere with their 
<A NAME="412"></A>essential activities]. Boxing, for example, is not a power of man qua man; 
<A NAME="413"></A>reasoning is: therefore reasoning, on this hypothesis, is not quality but 
<A NAME="414"></A>a natural possession of the mature human being; it therefore is called 
<A NAME="415"></A>a quality only by analogy. Thus, Quality is a power which adds the property 
<A NAME="416"></A>of being qualia to substances already existent.
<A NAME="417"></A><BR><BR>The differences distinguishing substances from each other are called 
<A NAME="418"></A>qualities only by analogy; they are, more strictly, Acts and Reason-Principles, 
<A NAME="419"></A>or parts of Reason-Principles, and though they may appear merely to qualify 
<A NAME="420"></A>the substance, they in fact indicate its essence.
<A NAME="421"></A><BR><BR>Qualities in the true sense- those, that is, which determine qualia- 
<A NAME="422"></A>being in accordance with our definition powers, will in virtue of this 
<A NAME="423"></A>common ground be a kind of Reason-Principle; they will also be in a sense 
<A NAME="424"></A>Forms, that is, excellences and imperfections whether of soul or of 
<A NAME="425"></A>body.
<A NAME="426"></A><BR><BR>But how can they all be powers? Beauty or health of soul or body, 
<A NAME="427"></A>very well: but surely not ugliness, disease, weakness, incapacity. In a 
<A NAME="428"></A>word, is powerlessness a power?
<A NAME="429"></A><BR><BR>It may be urged that these are qualities in so far as qualia are 
<A NAME="430"></A>also named after them: but may not the qualia be so called by analogy, 
<A NAME="431"></A>and not in the strict sense of the single principle? Not only may the term 
<A NAME="432"></A>be understood in the four ways [of Aristotle], but each of the four may 
<A NAME="433"></A>have at least a twofold significance.
<A NAME="434"></A><BR><BR>In the first place, Quality is not merely a question of action 
<A NAME="435"></A>and passion, involving a simple distinction between the potentially active 
<A NAME="436"></A>[quality] and the passive: health, disposition and habit, disease, strength 
<A NAME="437"></A>and weakness are also classed as qualities. It follows that the common 
<A NAME="438"></A>ground is not power, but something we have still to 
<A NAME="439"></A>seek.
<A NAME="440"></A><BR><BR>Again, not all qualities can be regarded as Reason-Principles: 
<A NAME="441"></A>chronic disease cannot be a Reason-Principle. Perhaps, however, we must 
<A NAME="442"></A>speak in such cases of privations, restricting the term "Quantities" to 
<A NAME="443"></A>Ideal-Forms and powers. Thus we shall have, not a single genus, but reference 
<A NAME="444"></A>only to the unity of a category. Knowledge will be regarded as a Form and 
<A NAME="445"></A>a power, ignorance as a privation and powerlessness.
<A NAME="446"></A><BR><BR>On the other hand, powerlessness and disease are a kind of Form; 
<A NAME="447"></A>disease and vice have many powers though looking to 
<A NAME="448"></A>evil.
<A NAME="449"></A><BR><BR>But how can a mere failure be a power? Doubtless the truth is that 
<A NAME="450"></A>every quality performs its own function independently of a standard; for 
<A NAME="451"></A>in no case could it produce an effect outside of its 
<A NAME="452"></A>power.
<A NAME="453"></A><BR><BR>Even beauty would seem to have a power of its own. Does this apply 
<A NAME="454"></A>to triangularity?
<A NAME="455"></A><BR><BR>Perhaps, after all, it is not a power we must consider, but a disposition. 
<A NAME="456"></A>Thus, qualities will be determined by the forms and characteristics of 
<A NAME="457"></A>the object qualified: their common element, then, will be Form and ideal 
<A NAME="458"></A>type, imposed upon Substance and posterior to it.
<A NAME="459"></A><BR><BR>But then, how do we account for the powers? We may doubtless remark 
<A NAME="460"></A>that even the natural boxer is so by being constituted in a particular 
<A NAME="461"></A>way; similarly, with the man unable to box: to generalize, the quality 
<A NAME="462"></A>is a characteristic non-essential. Whatever is seen to apply alike to Being 
<A NAME="463"></A>and to non-Being, as do heat and whiteness and colours generally, is either 
<A NAME="464"></A>different from Being- is, for example, an Act of Being- or else is some 
<A NAME="465"></A>secondary of Being, derived from it, contained in it, its image and 
<A NAME="466"></A>likeness.
<A NAME="467"></A><BR><BR>But if Quality is determined by formation and characteristic and 
<A NAME="468"></A>Reason-Principle, how explain the various cases of powerlessness and deformity? 
<A NAME="469"></A>Doubtless we must think of Principles imperfectly present, as in the case 
<A NAME="470"></A>of deformity. And disease- how does that imply a Reason-Principle? Here, 
<A NAME="471"></A>no doubt, we must think of a principle disturbed, the Principle of 
<A NAME="472"></A>health.
<A NAME="473"></A><BR><BR>But it is not necessary that all qualities involve a Reason-Principle; 
<A NAME="474"></A>it suffices that over and above the various kinds of disposition there 
<A NAME="475"></A>exist a common element distinct from Substance, and it is what comes after 
<A NAME="476"></A>the substance that constitutes Quality in an object.
<A NAME="477"></A><BR><BR>But triangularity is a quality of that in which it is present; 
<A NAME="478"></A>it is however no longer triangularity as such, but the triangularity present 
<A NAME="479"></A>in that definite object and modified in proportion to its success in shaping 
<A NAME="480"></A>that object.
<A NAME="481"></A><BR><BR><B>11.</B> But if these considerations are sound, why has Quality 
<A NAME="482"></A>more than one species? What is the ground for distinguishing between habit 
<A NAME="483"></A>and disposition, seeing that no differentia of Quality is involved in permanence 
<A NAME="484"></A>and non-permanence? A disposition of any kind is sufficient to constitute 
<A NAME="485"></A>a quality; permanence is a mere external addition. It might however be 
<A NAME="486"></A>urged that dispositions are but incomplete "forms"- if the term may pass- 
<A NAME="487"></A>habits being complete ones. But incomplete, they are not qualities; if 
<A NAME="488"></A>already qualities, the permanence is an external addition.
<A NAME="489"></A><BR><BR>How do physical powers form a distinct species? If they are classed 
<A NAME="490"></A>as qualities in virtue of being powers, power, we have seen, is not a necessary 
<A NAME="491"></A>concomitant of qualities. If, however, we hold that the natural boxer owes 
<A NAME="492"></A>his quality to a particular disposition, power is something added and does 
<A NAME="493"></A>not contribute to the quality, since power is found in habits 
<A NAME="494"></A>also.
<A NAME="495"></A><BR><BR>Another point: why is natural ability to be distinguished from 
<A NAME="496"></A>that acquired by learning? Surely, if both are qualities, they cannot be 
<A NAME="497"></A>differentiae of Quality: gained by practice or given in nature, it is the 
<A NAME="498"></A>same ability; the differentia will be external to Quality; it cannot be 
<A NAME="499"></A>deduced from the Ideal Form of boxing. Whether some qualities as distinguished 
<A NAME="500"></A>from others are derived from experience is immaterial; the source of the 
<A NAME="501"></A>quality makes no difference- none, I mean, pointing to variations and differences 
<A NAME="502"></A>of Quality.
<A NAME="503"></A><BR><BR>A further question would seem to be involved: If certain qualities 
<A NAME="504"></A>are derived from experience but here is a discrepancy in the manner and 
<A NAME="505"></A>source of the experience, how are they to be included in the same species? 
<A NAME="506"></A>And again, if some create the experience, others are created by it, the 
<A NAME="507"></A>term Quality as applied to both classes will be equivocal.
<A NAME="508"></A><BR><BR>And what part is played by the individual form? If it constitutes 
<A NAME="509"></A>the individual's specific character, it is not a quality; if, however, 
<A NAME="510"></A>it is what makes an object beautiful or ugly after the specific form has 
<A NAME="511"></A>been determined, then it involves a Reason-Principle.
<A NAME="512"></A><BR><BR>Rough and smooth, tenuous and dense may rightly be classed as qualities. 
<A NAME="513"></A>It is true that they are not determined by distances and approximations, 
<A NAME="514"></A>or in general by even or uneven dispositions, of parts; though, were they 
<A NAME="515"></A>so determined, they might well even then be qualities.
<A NAME="516"></A><BR><BR>Knowledge of the meaning of "light" and "heavy" will reveal their 
<A NAME="517"></A>place in the classification. An ambiguity will however be latent in the 
<A NAME="518"></A>term "light," unless it be determined by comparative weight: it would then 
<A NAME="519"></A>implicate leanness and fineness, and involve another species distinct from 
<A NAME="520"></A>the four [of Aristotle].
<A NAME="521"></A><BR><BR><B>12.</B> If then we do not propose to divide Quality in this 
<A NAME="522"></A>[fourfold] manner, what basis of division have we?
<A NAME="523"></A><BR><BR>We must examine whether qualities may not prove to be divisible 
<A NAME="524"></A>on the principle that some belong to the body and others to the soul. Those 
<A NAME="525"></A>of the body would be subdivided according to the senses, some being attributed 
<A NAME="526"></A>to sight, others to hearing and taste, others to smell and touch. Those 
<A NAME="527"></A>of the soul would presumably be allotted to appetite, emotion, reason; 
<A NAME="528"></A>though, again, they may be distinguished by the differences of the activities 
<A NAME="529"></A>they condition, in so far as activities are engendered by these qualities; 
<A NAME="530"></A>or according as they are beneficial or injurious, the benefits and injuries 
<A NAME="531"></A>being duly classified. This last is applicable also to the classification 
<A NAME="532"></A>of bodily qualities, which also produce differences of benefit and injury: 
<A NAME="533"></A>these differences must be regarded as distinctively qualitative; for either 
<A NAME="534"></A>the benefit and injury are held to be derived from Quality and the quale, 
<A NAME="535"></A>or else some other explanation must be found for them.
<A NAME="536"></A><BR><BR>A point for consideration is how the quale, as conditioned by Quality, 
<A NAME="537"></A>can belong to the same category: obviously there can be no single genus 
<A NAME="538"></A>embracing both.
<A NAME="539"></A><BR><BR>Further, if "boxer" is in the category of Quality, why not "agent" 
<A NAME="540"></A>as well? And with agent goes "active." Thus "active" need not go into the 
<A NAME="541"></A>category of Relation; nor again need "passive," if "patient" is a quale. 
<A NAME="542"></A>Moreover, agent" is perhaps better assigned to the category of Quality 
<A NAME="543"></A>for the reason that the term implies power, and power is Quality. But if 
<A NAME="544"></A>power as such were determined by Substance [and not by Quality], the agent, 
<A NAME="545"></A>though ceasing to be a quale, would not necessarily become a relative. 
<A NAME="546"></A>Besides, "active" is not like "greater": the greater, to be the greater, 
<A NAME="547"></A>demands a less, whereas "active" stands complete by the mere possession 
<A NAME="548"></A>of its specific character.
<A NAME="549"></A><BR><BR>It may however be urged that while the possession of that character 
<A NAME="550"></A>makes it a quale, it is a relative in so far as it directs upon an external 
<A NAME="551"></A>object the power indicated by its name. Why, then, is not "boxer" a relative, 
<A NAME="552"></A>and "boxing" as well? Boxing is entirely related to an external object; 
<A NAME="553"></A>its whole theory pre-supposes this external. And in the case of the other 
<A NAME="554"></A>arts- or most of them- investigation would probably warrant the assertion 
<A NAME="555"></A>that in so far as they affect the soul they are qualities, while in so 
<A NAME="556"></A>far as they look outward they are active and as being directed to an external 
<A NAME="557"></A>object are relatives. They are relatives in the other sense also that they 
<A NAME="558"></A>are thought of as habits.
<A NAME="559"></A><BR><BR>Can it then be held that there is any distinct reality implied 
<A NAME="560"></A>in activity, seeing that the active is something distinct only according 
<A NAME="561"></A>as it is a quale? It may perhaps be held that the tendency towards action 
<A NAME="562"></A>of living beings, and especially of those having freewill, implies a reality 
<A NAME="563"></A>of activity [as well as a reality of Quality].
<A NAME="564"></A><BR><BR>But what is the function of the active in connection with those 
<A NAME="565"></A>non-living powers which we have classed as qualities? Doubtless to recruit 
<A NAME="566"></A>any object it encounters, making the object a participant in its 
<A NAME="567"></A>content.
<A NAME="568"></A><BR><BR>But if one same object both acts and is acted upon, how do we then 
<A NAME="569"></A>explain the active? Observe also that the greater- in itself perhaps a 
<A NAME="570"></A>fixed three yards' length- will present itself as both greater and less 
<A NAME="571"></A>according to its external contacts.
<A NAME="572"></A><BR><BR>It will be objected that greater and less are due to participation 
<A NAME="573"></A>in greatness and smallness; and it might be inferred that a thing is active 
<A NAME="574"></A>or passive by participation in activity or passivity.
<A NAME="575"></A><BR><BR>This is the place for enquiring also whether the qualities of the 
<A NAME="576"></A>Sensible and Intellectual realms can be included under one head- a question 
<A NAME="577"></A>intended only for those who ascribe qualities to the higher realm as well 
<A NAME="578"></A>as the lower. And even if Ideal Forms of qualities are not posited, yet 
<A NAME="579"></A>once the term "habit" is used in reference to Intellect, the question arises 
<A NAME="580"></A>whether there is anything common to that habit and the habit we know in 
<A NAME="581"></A>the lower.
<A NAME="582"></A><BR><BR>Wisdom too is generally admitted to exist There. Obviously, if 
<A NAME="583"></A>it shares only its name with our wisdom, it is not to be reckoned among 
<A NAME="584"></A>things of this sphere; if, however, the import is in both cases the same, 
<A NAME="585"></A>then Quality is common to both realms- unless, of course, it be maintained 
<A NAME="586"></A>that everything There, including even intellection, is 
<A NAME="587"></A>Substance.
<A NAME="588"></A><BR><BR>This question, however, applies to all the categories: are the 
<A NAME="589"></A>two spheres irreconcilable, or can they be co-ordinated with a 
<A NAME="590"></A>unity?
<A NAME="591"></A><BR><BR><B>13.</B> With regard to Date:
<A NAME="592"></A><BR>If "yesterday," "to-morrow," "last year" and similar terms denote parts 
<A NAME="593"></A>of time, why should they not be included in the same genus as time? It 
<A NAME="594"></A>would seem only reasonable to range under time the past, present and future, 
<A NAME="595"></A>which are its species. But time is referred to Quantity; what then is the 
<A NAME="596"></A>need for a separate category of Date?
<A NAME="597"></A><BR><BR>If we are told that past and future- including under past such 
<A NAME="598"></A>definite dates as yesterday and last year which must clearly be subordinate 
<A NAME="599"></A>to past time- and even the present "now" are not merely time but time- 
<A NAME="600"></A>when, we reply, in the first place, that the notion of time- when involves 
<A NAME="601"></A>time; that, further, if "yesterday" is time-gone-by, it will be a composite, 
<A NAME="602"></A>since time and gone-by are distinct notions: we have two categories instead 
<A NAME="603"></A>of the single one required.
<A NAME="604"></A><BR><BR>But suppose that Date is defined not as time but as that which 
<A NAME="605"></A>is in time; if by that which is in time is meant the subject- Socrates 
<A NAME="606"></A>in the proposition "Socrates existed last year"- that subject is external 
<A NAME="607"></A>to the notion of time, and we have again a duality.
<A NAME="608"></A><BR><BR>Consider, however, the proposition "Socrates- or some action- exists 
<A NAME="609"></A>at this time"; what can be the meaning here other than "in a part of time"? 
<A NAME="610"></A>But if, admitted that Date is "a part of time," it be felt that the part 
<A NAME="611"></A>requires definition and involves something more than mere time, that we 
<A NAME="612"></A>must say the part of time gone by, several notions are massed in the proposition: 
<A NAME="613"></A>we have the part which qua part is a relative; and we have "gone-by" which, 
<A NAME="614"></A>if it is to have any import at all, must mean the past: but this "past," 
<A NAME="615"></A>we have shown, is a species of time.
<A NAME="616"></A><BR><BR>It may be urged that "the past" is in its nature indefinite, while 
<A NAME="617"></A>"yesterday" and "last year" are definite. We reply, first, that we demand 
<A NAME="618"></A>some place in our classification for the past: secondly, that "yesterday," 
<A NAME="619"></A>as definite past, is necessarily definite time. But definite time implies 
<A NAME="620"></A>a certain quantity of time: therefore, if time is quantitative, each of 
<A NAME="621"></A>the terms in question must signify a definite quantity.
<A NAME="622"></A><BR><BR>Again, if by "yesterday" we are expected to understand that this 
<A NAME="623"></A>or that event has taken Place at a definite time gone by, we have more 
<A NAME="624"></A>notions than ever. Besides, if we must introduce fresh categories because 
<A NAME="625"></A>one thing acts in another- as in this case something acts in time- we have 
<A NAME="626"></A>more again from its acting upon another in another. This point will be 
<A NAME="627"></A>made plain by what follows in our discussion of Place.
<A NAME="628"></A><BR><BR><B>14.</B> The Academy and the Lyceum are places, and parts of 
<A NAME="629"></A>Place, just as "above," "below," "here" are species or parts of Place; 
<A NAME="630"></A>the difference is of minuter delimitation.
<A NAME="631"></A><BR><BR>If then "above," "below," "the middle" are places- Delphi, for 
<A NAME="632"></A>example, is the middle [of the earth]- and "near-the-middle" is also a 
<A NAME="633"></A>place- Athens, and of course the Lyceum and the other places usually cited, 
<A NAME="634"></A>are near the middle- what need have we to go further and seek beyond Place, 
<A NAME="635"></A>admitting as we do that we refer in every instance to a 
<A NAME="636"></A>place?
<A NAME="637"></A><BR><BR>If, however, we have in mind the presence of one thing in another, 
<A NAME="638"></A>we are not speaking of a single entity, we are not expressing a single 
<A NAME="639"></A>notion.
<A NAME="640"></A><BR><BR>Another consideration: when we say that a man is here, we present 
<A NAME="641"></A>a relation of the man to that in which he is, a relation of the container 
<A NAME="642"></A>to the contained. Why then do we not class as a relative whatever may be 
<A NAME="643"></A>produced from this relation?
<A NAME="644"></A><BR><BR>Besides, how does "here" differ from "at Athens"? The demonstrative 
<A NAME="645"></A>"here" admittedly signifies place; so, then, does "at Athens": "at Athens" 
<A NAME="646"></A>therefore belongs to the category of Place.
<A NAME="647"></A><BR><BR>Again, if "at Athens" means "is at Athens," then the "is" as well 
<A NAME="648"></A>as the place belongs to the predicate; but this cannot be right: we do 
<A NAME="649"></A>not regard "is a quality" as predicate, but "a quality."
<A NAME="650"></A><BR><BR>Furthermore, if "in time," "in place" are to be ranged under a 
<A NAME="651"></A>category other than that applying to time and place, why not a separate 
<A NAME="652"></A>category for "in a vessel"? Why not distinct categories for "in Matter," 
<A NAME="653"></A>"in a subject," "a part in a whole," "a whole in its parts," "a genus in 
<A NAME="654"></A>its species," "a species in a genus"? We are certainly on the way to a 
<A NAME="655"></A>goodly number of categories.
<A NAME="656"></A><BR><BR><B>15.</B> The "category of Action":
<A NAME="657"></A><BR>The quantum has been regarded as a single genus on the ground that 
<A NAME="658"></A>Quantity and Number are attributes of Substance and posterior to it; the 
<A NAME="659"></A>quale has been regarded as another genus because Quality is an attribute 
<A NAME="660"></A>of Substance: on the same principle it is maintained that since activity 
<A NAME="661"></A>is an attribute of Substance, Action constitutes yet another 
<A NAME="662"></A>genus.
<A NAME="663"></A><BR><BR>Does then the action constitute the genus, or the activity from 
<A NAME="664"></A>which the action springs, in the same way as Quality is the genus from 
<A NAME="665"></A>which the quale is derived? Perhaps activity, action and agent should all 
<A NAME="666"></A>be embraced under a single head? But, on the one hand, the action- unlike 
<A NAME="667"></A>activity- tends to comport the agent; and on the other, it signifies being 
<A NAME="668"></A>in some activity and therefore Being-in-Act [actual as distinct from potential 
<A NAME="669"></A>Being]. Consequently the category will be one of Act rather than of 
<A NAME="670"></A>Action.
<A NAME="671"></A><BR><BR>Act moreover incontestably manifests itself in Substance, as was 
<A NAME="672"></A>found to be the case with Quality: it is connected with Substance as being 
<A NAME="673"></A>a form of motion. But Motion is a distinct genus: for, seeing that Quality 
<A NAME="674"></A>is a distinct attribute of Substance, and Quality a distinct attribute, 
<A NAME="675"></A>and Relative takes its being from the relation of one substance to another, 
<A NAME="676"></A>there can be no reason why Motion, also an attribute of Substance, should 
<A NAME="677"></A>not also constitute a distinct genus.
<A NAME="678"></A><BR><BR><B>16.</B> If it be urged that Motion is but imperfect Act, there 
<A NAME="679"></A>would be no objection to giving priority to Act and subordinating to it 
<A NAME="680"></A>Motion with its imperfection as a species: Act would thus be predicated 
<A NAME="681"></A>of Motion, but with the qualification "imperfect."
<A NAME="682"></A><BR><BR>Motion is thought of as imperfect, not because it is not an Act, 
<A NAME="683"></A>but because, entirely an Act, it yet entails repetition [lacks finality]. 
<A NAME="684"></A>It repeats, not in order that it may achieve actuality- it is already actual- 
<A NAME="685"></A>but that it may attain a goal distinct from itself and posterior: it is 
<A NAME="686"></A>not the motion itself that is then consummated but the result at which 
<A NAME="687"></A>it aims. Walking is walking from the outset; when one should traverse a 
<A NAME="688"></A>racecourse but has not yet done so, the deficiency lies not in the walking- 
<A NAME="689"></A>not in the motion- but in the amount of walking accomplished; no matter 
<A NAME="690"></A>what the amount, it is walking and motion already: a moving man has motion 
<A NAME="691"></A>and a cutter cuts before there is any question of Quantity. And just as 
<A NAME="692"></A>we can speak of Act without implying time, so we can of Motion, except 
<A NAME="693"></A>in the sense of motion over a defined area; Act is timeless, and so is 
<A NAME="694"></A>Motion pure and simple.
<A NAME="695"></A><BR><BR>Are we told that Motion is necessarily in time, inasmuch as it 
<A NAME="696"></A>involves continuity? But, at this, sight, never ceasing to see, will also 
<A NAME="697"></A>be continuous and in time. Our critic, it is true, may find support in 
<A NAME="698"></A>that principle of proportion which states that you may make a division 
<A NAME="699"></A>of no matter what motion, and find that neither the motion nor its duration 
<A NAME="700"></A>has any beginning but that the division may be continued indefinitely in 
<A NAME="701"></A>the direction of the motion's origin: this would mean that a motion just 
<A NAME="702"></A>begun has been in progress from an infinity of time, that it is infinite 
<A NAME="703"></A>as regards its beginning.
<A NAME="704"></A><BR><BR>Such then is the result of separating Act from Motion: Act, we 
<A NAME="705"></A>aver, is timeless; yet we are forced to maintain not only that time is 
<A NAME="706"></A>necessary to quantitative motion, but, unreservedly, that Motion is quantitative 
<A NAME="707"></A>in its very nature; though indeed, if it were a case of motion occupying 
<A NAME="708"></A>a day or some other quantity of time, the exponents of this view would 
<A NAME="709"></A>be the first to admit that Quantity is present to Motion only by way of 
<A NAME="710"></A>accident.
<A NAME="711"></A><BR><BR>In sum, just as Act is timeless, so there is no reason why Motion 
<A NAME="712"></A>also should not primarily be timeless, time attaching to it only in so 
<A NAME="713"></A>far as it happens to have such and such an extension.
<A NAME="714"></A><BR><BR>Timeless change is sanctioned in the expression, "as if change 
<A NAME="715"></A>could not take place all at once"; if then change is timeless, why not 
<A NAME="716"></A>Motion also?- Change, be it noted, is here distinguished from the result 
<A NAME="717"></A>of change, the result being unnecessary to establish the change 
<A NAME="718"></A>itself.
<A NAME="719"></A><BR><BR><B>17.</B> We may be told that neither Act nor Motion requires 
<A NAME="720"></A>a genus for itself, but that both revert to Relation, Act belonging to 
<A NAME="721"></A>the potentially active, Motion to the potentially motive. Our reply is 
<A NAME="722"></A>that Relation produces relatives as such, and not the mere reference to 
<A NAME="723"></A>an external standard; given the existence of a thing, whether attributive 
<A NAME="724"></A>or relative, it holds its essential character prior to any relationship: 
<A NAME="725"></A>so then must Act and Motion, and even such an attribute as habit; they 
<A NAME="726"></A>are not prevented from being prior to any relationship they may occupy, 
<A NAME="727"></A>or from being conceivable in themselves. Otherwise, everything will be 
<A NAME="728"></A>relative; for anything you think of- even Soul- bears some relationship 
<A NAME="729"></A>to something else.
<A NAME="730"></A><BR><BR>But, to return to activity proper and the action, is there any 
<A NAME="731"></A>reason why these should be referred to Relation? They must in every instance 
<A NAME="732"></A>be either Motion or Act.
<A NAME="733"></A><BR><BR>If however activity is referred to Relation and the action made 
<A NAME="734"></A>a distinct genus, why is not Motion referred to Relation and the movement 
<A NAME="735"></A>made a distinct genus? Why not bisect the unity, Motion, and so make Action 
<A NAME="736"></A>and Passion two species of the one thing, ceasing to consider Action and 
<A NAME="737"></A>Passion as two genera?
<A NAME="738"></A><BR><BR><B>18.</B> There are other questions calling for 
<A NAME="739"></A>consideration:
<A NAME="740"></A><BR>First: Are both Acts and motions to be included in the category of 
<A NAME="741"></A>Action, with the distinction that Acts are momentary while Motions, such 
<A NAME="742"></A>as cutting, are in time? Or will both be regarded as motions or as involving 
<A NAME="743"></A>Motion?
<A NAME="744"></A><BR><BR>Secondly: Will all activities be related to passivity, or will 
<A NAME="745"></A>some- for example, walking and speaking- be considered as independent of 
<A NAME="746"></A>it?
<A NAME="747"></A><BR><BR>Thirdly: Will all those related to passivity be classed as motions 
<A NAME="748"></A>and the independent as Acts, or will the two classes overlap? Walking, 
<A NAME="749"></A>for instance, which is an independent, would, one supposes, be a motion; 
<A NAME="750"></A>thinking, which also does not essentially involve "passivity," an Act: 
<A NAME="751"></A>otherwise we must hold that thinking and walking are not even actions. 
<A NAME="752"></A>But if they are not in the category of Action, where then in our classification 
<A NAME="753"></A>must they fall?
<A NAME="754"></A><BR><BR>It may perhaps be urged that the act of thinking, together with 
<A NAME="755"></A>the faculty of thought, should be regarded as relative to the thought object; 
<A NAME="756"></A>for is not the faculty of sensation treated as relative to the sensible 
<A NAME="757"></A>object? If then, we may ask, in the analogue the faculty of sensation is 
<A NAME="758"></A>treated as relative to the sensible object, why not the sensory act as 
<A NAME="759"></A>well? The fact is that even sensation, though related to an external object, 
<A NAME="760"></A>has something besides that relation: it has, namely, its own status of 
<A NAME="761"></A>being either an Act or a Passion. Now the Passion is separable from the 
<A NAME="762"></A>condition of being attached to some object and caused by some object: so, 
<A NAME="763"></A>then, is the Act a distinct entity. Walking is similarly attached and caused, 
<A NAME="764"></A>and yet has besides the status of being a motion. It follows that thought, 
<A NAME="765"></A>in addition to its relationship, will have the status of being either a 
<A NAME="766"></A>motion or an Act.
<A NAME="767"></A><BR><BR><B>19.</B> We have to ask ourselves whether there are not certain 
<A NAME="768"></A>Acts which without the addition of a time-element will be thought of as 
<A NAME="769"></A>imperfect and therefore classed with motions. Take for instance living 
<A NAME="770"></A>and life. The life of a definite person implies a certain adequate period, 
<A NAME="771"></A>just as his happiness is no merely instantaneous thing. Life and happiness 
<A NAME="772"></A>are, in other words, of the nature ascribed to Motion: both therefore must 
<A NAME="773"></A>be treated as motions, and Motion must be regarded as a unity, a single 
<A NAME="774"></A>genus; besides the quantity and quality belonging to Substance we must 
<A NAME="775"></A>take count of the motion manifested in it.
<A NAME="776"></A><BR><BR>We may further find desirable to distinguish bodily from psychic 
<A NAME="777"></A>motions or spontaneous motions from those induced by external forces, or 
<A NAME="778"></A>the original from the derivative, the original motions being activities, 
<A NAME="779"></A>whether externally related or independent, while the derivative will be 
<A NAME="780"></A>Passions.
<A NAME="781"></A><BR><BR>But surely the motions having external tendency are actually identical 
<A NAME="782"></A>with those of external derivation: the cutting issuing from the cutter 
<A NAME="783"></A>and that effected in the object are one, though to cut is not the same 
<A NAME="784"></A>as to be cut.
<A NAME="785"></A><BR><BR>Perhaps however the cutting issuing from the cutter and that which 
<A NAME="786"></A>takes place in the cut object are in fact not one, but "to cut" implies 
<A NAME="787"></A>that from a particular Act and motion there results a different motion 
<A NAME="788"></A>in the object cut. Or perhaps the difference [between Action and Passion] 
<A NAME="789"></A>lies not in the fact of being cut, but in the distinct emotion supervening, 
<A NAME="790"></A>pain for example: passivity has this connotation also.
<A NAME="791"></A><BR><BR>But when there is no pain, what occurs? Nothing, surely, but the 
<A NAME="792"></A>Act of the agent upon the patient object: this is all that is meant in 
<A NAME="793"></A>such cases by Action. Action, thus, becomes twofold: there is that which 
<A NAME="794"></A>occurs in the external, and that which does not. The duality of Action 
<A NAME="795"></A>and Passion, suggested by the notion that Action [always] takes place in 
<A NAME="796"></A>an external, is abandoned.
<A NAME="797"></A><BR><BR>Even writing, though taking place upon an external object, does 
<A NAME="798"></A>not call for passivity, since no effect is produced, upon the tablet beyond 
<A NAME="799"></A>the Act of the writer, nothing like pain; we may be told that the tablet 
<A NAME="800"></A>has been inscribed, but this does not suffice for passivity.
<A NAME="801"></A><BR><BR>Again, in the case of walking there is the earth trodden upon, 
<A NAME="802"></A>but no one thinks of it as having experienced Passion [or suffering]. Treading 
<A NAME="803"></A>on a living body, we think of suffering, because we reflect not upon the 
<A NAME="804"></A>walking but upon the ensuing pain: otherwise we should think of suffering 
<A NAME="805"></A>in the case of the tablet as well.
<A NAME="806"></A><BR><BR>It is so in every case of Action: we cannot but think of it as 
<A NAME="807"></A>knit into a unity with its opposite, Passion. Not that this later "Passion" 
<A NAME="808"></A>is the opposite of Action in the way in which being burned is the opposite 
<A NAME="809"></A>of burning: by Passion in this sense we mean the effect supervening upon 
<A NAME="810"></A>the combined facts of the burning and the being burned, whether this effect 
<A NAME="811"></A>be pain or some such process as withering.
<A NAME="812"></A><BR><BR>Suppose this Passion to be treated as of itself producing pain: 
<A NAME="813"></A>have we not still the duality of agent and patient, two results from the 
<A NAME="814"></A>one Act? The Act may no longer include the will to cause pain; but it produces 
<A NAME="815"></A>something distinct from itself, a pain-causing medium which enters into 
<A NAME="816"></A>the object about to experience pain: this medium, while retaining its individuality, 
<A NAME="817"></A>produces something yet different, the feeling of pain.
<A NAME="818"></A><BR><BR>What does this suggest? Surely that the very medium- the act of 
<A NAME="819"></A>hearing, for instance- is, even before it produces pain or without producing 
<A NAME="820"></A>pain at all, a Passion of that into which it enters.
<A NAME="821"></A><BR><BR>But hearing, with sensation in general, is in fact not a Passion. 
<A NAME="822"></A>Yet to feel pain is to experience a Passion- a Passion however which is 
<A NAME="823"></A>not opposed to Action.
<A NAME="824"></A><BR><BR><B>20.</B> But though not opposed, it is still different from Action 
<A NAME="825"></A>and cannot belong to the same genus as activity; though if they are both 
<A NAME="826"></A>Motion, it will so belong, on the principle that alteration must be regarded 
<A NAME="827"></A>as qualitative motion.
<A NAME="828"></A><BR><BR>Does it follow that whenever alteration proceeds from Quality, 
<A NAME="829"></A>it will be activity and Action, the quale remaining impassive? It may be 
<A NAME="830"></A>that if the quale remains impassive, the alteration will be in the category 
<A NAME="831"></A>of Action; whereas if, while its energy is directed outwards, it also suffers- 
<A NAME="832"></A>as in beating- it will cease to belong to that category: or perhaps there 
<A NAME="833"></A>is nothing to prevent its being in both categories at one and the same 
<A NAME="834"></A>moment.
<A NAME="835"></A><BR><BR>If then an alteration be conditioned by Passivity alone, as is 
<A NAME="836"></A>the case with rubbing, on what ground is it assigned to Action rather than 
<A NAME="837"></A>to Passivity? Perhaps the Passivity arises from the fact that a counter-rubbing 
<A NAME="838"></A>is involved. But are we, in view of this counter-motion, to recognize the 
<A NAME="839"></A>presence of two distinct motions? No: one only.
<A NAME="840"></A><BR><BR>How then can this one motion be both Action and Passion? We must 
<A NAME="841"></A>suppose it to be Action in proceeding from an object, and Passion in being 
<A NAME="842"></A>directly upon another- though it remains the same motion 
<A NAME="843"></A>throughout.
<A NAME="844"></A><BR><BR>Suppose however Passion to be a different motion from Action: how 
<A NAME="845"></A>then does its modification of the patient object change that patient's 
<A NAME="846"></A>character without the agent being affected by the patient? For obviously 
<A NAME="847"></A>an agent cannot be passive to the operation it performs upon another. Can 
<A NAME="848"></A>it be that the fact of motion existing elsewhere creates the Passion, which 
<A NAME="849"></A>was not Passion in the agent?
<A NAME="850"></A><BR><BR>If the whiteness of the swan, produced by its Reason-Principle, 
<A NAME="851"></A>is given at its birth, are we to affirm Passion of the swan on its passing 
<A NAME="852"></A>into being? If, on the contrary, the swan grows white after birth, and 
<A NAME="853"></A>if there is a cause of that growth and the corresponding result, are we 
<A NAME="854"></A>to say that the growth is a Passion? Or must we confine Passion to purely 
<A NAME="855"></A>qualitative change?
<A NAME="856"></A><BR><BR>One thing confers beauty and another takes it: is that which takes 
<A NAME="857"></A>beauty to be regarded as patient? If then the source of beauty- tin, suppose- 
<A NAME="858"></A>should deteriorate or actually disappear, while the recipient- copper- 
<A NAME="859"></A>improves, are we to think of the copper as passive and the tin 
<A NAME="860"></A>active?
<A NAME="861"></A><BR><BR>Take the learner: how can he be regarded as passive, seeing that 
<A NAME="862"></A>the Act of the agent passes into him [and becomes his Act]? How can the 
<A NAME="863"></A>Act, necessarily a simple entity, be both Act and Passion? No doubt the 
<A NAME="864"></A>Act is not in itself a Passion; nonetheless, the learner coming to possess 
<A NAME="865"></A>it will be a patient by the fact of his appropriation of an experience 
<A NAME="866"></A>from outside: he will not, of course, be a patient in the sense of having 
<A NAME="867"></A>himself performed no Act; learning- like seeing- is not analogous to being 
<A NAME="868"></A>struck, since it involves the acts of apprehension and 
<A NAME="869"></A>recognition.
<A NAME="870"></A><BR><BR><B>21.</B> How, then, are we to recognise Passivity, since clearly 
<A NAME="871"></A>it is not to be found in the Act from outside which the recipient in turn 
<A NAME="872"></A>makes his own? Surely we must look for it in cases where the patient remains 
<A NAME="873"></A>without Act, the passivity pure.
<A NAME="874"></A><BR><BR>Imagine a case where an agent improves, though its Act tends towards 
<A NAME="875"></A>deterioration. Or, say, a a man's activity is guided by evil and is allowed 
<A NAME="876"></A>to dominate another's without restraint. In these cases the Act is clearly 
<A NAME="877"></A>wrong, the Passion blameless.
<A NAME="878"></A><BR><BR>What then is the real distinction between Action and Passion? Is 
<A NAME="879"></A>it that Action starts from within and is directed upon an outside object, 
<A NAME="880"></A>while Passion is derived from without and fulfilled within? What, then, 
<A NAME="881"></A>are we to say of such cases as thought and opinion which originate within 
<A NAME="882"></A>but are not directed outwards? Again, the Passion "being heated" rises 
<A NAME="883"></A>within the self, when that self is provoked by an opinion to reflection 
<A NAME="884"></A>or to anger, without the intervention of any external. Still it remains 
<A NAME="885"></A>true that Action, whether self-centred or with external tendency, is a 
<A NAME="886"></A>motion rising in the self.
<A NAME="887"></A><BR><BR>How then do we explain desire and other forms of aspiration? Aspiration 
<A NAME="888"></A>must be a motion having its origin in the object aspired to, though some 
<A NAME="889"></A>might disallow "origin" and be content with saying that the motion aroused 
<A NAME="890"></A>is subsequent to the object; in what respect, then, does aspiring differ 
<A NAME="891"></A>from taking a blow or being borne down by a thrust?
<A NAME="892"></A><BR><BR>Perhaps, however, we should divide aspirations into two classes, 
<A NAME="893"></A>those which follow intellect being described as Actions, the merely impulsive 
<A NAME="894"></A>being Passions. Passivity now will not turn on origin, without or within- 
<A NAME="895"></A>within there can only be deficiency; but whenever a thing, without itself 
<A NAME="896"></A>assisting in the process, undergoes an alteration not directed to the creation 
<A NAME="897"></A>of Being but changing the thing for the worse or not for the better, such 
<A NAME="898"></A>an alteration will be regarded as a Passion and as entailing 
<A NAME="899"></A>passivity.
<A NAME="900"></A><BR><BR>If however "being heated" means "acquiring heat," and is sometimes 
<A NAME="901"></A>found to contribute to the production of Being and sometimes not, passivity 
<A NAME="902"></A>will be identical with impassivity: besides, "being heated" must then have 
<A NAME="903"></A>a double significance [according as it does or does not contribute to 
<A NAME="904"></A>Being].
<A NAME="905"></A><BR><BR>The fact is, however, that "being heated," even when it contributes 
<A NAME="906"></A>to Being, involves the presence of a patient [distinct from the being produced]. 
<A NAME="907"></A>Take the case of the bronze which has to be heated and so is a patient; 
<A NAME="908"></A>the being is a statue, which is not heated except accidentally [by the 
<A NAME="909"></A>accident of being contained in the bronze]. If then the bronze becomes 
<A NAME="910"></A>more beautiful as a result of being heated and in the same proportion, 
<A NAME="911"></A>it certainly becomes so by passivity; for passivity must, clearly, take 
<A NAME="912"></A>two forms: there is the passivity which tends to alteration for better 
<A NAME="913"></A>or for worse, and there is the passivity which has neither 
<A NAME="914"></A>tendency.
<A NAME="915"></A><BR><BR><B>22.</B> Passivity, thus, implies the existence within of a motion 
<A NAME="916"></A>functioning somehow or other in the direction of alteration. Action too 
<A NAME="917"></A>implies motion within, whether the motion be aimless or whether it be driven 
<A NAME="918"></A>by the impulse comported by the term "Action" to find its goal in an external 
<A NAME="919"></A>object. There is Motion in both Action and Passion, but the differentia 
<A NAME="920"></A>distinguishing Action from Passion keeps Action impassive, while Passion 
<A NAME="921"></A>is recognised by the fact that a new state replaces the old, though nothing 
<A NAME="922"></A>is added to the essential character of the patient; whenever Being [essential 
<A NAME="923"></A>Being] is produced, the patient remains distinct.
<A NAME="924"></A><BR><BR>Thus, what is Action in one relation may be Passion in another. 
<A NAME="925"></A>One same motion will be Action from the point of view of A, Passion from 
<A NAME="926"></A>that of B; for the two are so disposed that they might well be consigned 
<A NAME="927"></A>to the category of Relation- at any rate in the cases where the Action 
<A NAME="928"></A>entails a corresponding Passion: neither correlative is found in isolation; 
<A NAME="929"></A>each involves both Action and Passion, though A acts as mover and B is 
<A NAME="930"></A>moved: each then involves two categories.
<A NAME="931"></A><BR><BR>Again, A gives motion to B, B receives it, so that we have a giving 
<A NAME="932"></A>and a receiving- in a word, a relation.
<A NAME="933"></A><BR><BR>But a recipient must possess what it has received. A thing is admitted 
<A NAME="934"></A>to possess its natural colour: why not its motion also? Besides, independent 
<A NAME="935"></A>motions such as walking and thought do, in fact, involve the possession 
<A NAME="936"></A>of the powers respectively to walk and to think.
<A NAME="937"></A><BR><BR>We are reminded to enquire whether thought in the form of providence 
<A NAME="938"></A>constitutes Action; to be subject to providence is apparently Passion, 
<A NAME="939"></A>for such thought is directed to an external, the object of the providential 
<A NAME="940"></A>arrangement. But it may well be that neither is the exercise of providence 
<A NAME="941"></A>an action, even though the thought is concerned with an external, nor subjection 
<A NAME="942"></A>to it a Passion. Thought itself need not be an action, for it does not 
<A NAME="943"></A>go outward towards its object but remains self-gathered. It is not always 
<A NAME="944"></A>an activity; all Acts need not be definable as activities, for they need 
<A NAME="945"></A>not produce an effect; activity belongs to Act only 
<A NAME="946"></A>accidentally.
<A NAME="947"></A><BR><BR>Does it follow that if a man as he walks produces footprints, he 
<A NAME="948"></A>cannot be considered to have performed an action? Certainly as a result 
<A NAME="949"></A>of his existing something distinct from himself has come into being. Yet 
<A NAME="950"></A>perhaps we should regard both action and Act as merely accidental, because 
<A NAME="951"></A>he did not aim at this result: it would be as we speak of Action even in 
<A NAME="952"></A>things inanimate- "fire heats," "the drug worked."
<A NAME="953"></A><BR><BR>So much for Action and Passion.
<A NAME="954"></A><BR><B>23.</B> As for Possession, if the term is used comprehensively, 
<A NAME="955"></A>why are not all its modes to be brought under one category? Possession, 
<A NAME="956"></A>thus, would include the quantum as possessing magnitude, the quale as possessing 
<A NAME="957"></A>colour; it would include fatherhood and the complementary relationships, 
<A NAME="958"></A>since the father possesses the son and the son possesses the father: in 
<A NAME="959"></A>short, it would include all belongings.
<A NAME="960"></A><BR><BR>If, on the contrary, the category of Possession comprises only 
<A NAME="961"></A>the things of the body, such as weapons and shoes, we first ask why this 
<A NAME="962"></A>should be so, and why their possession produces a single category, while 
<A NAME="963"></A>burning, cutting, burying or casting them out do not give another or others. 
<A NAME="964"></A>If it is because these things are carried on the person, then one's mantle 
<A NAME="965"></A>lying on a couch will come under a different category from that of the 
<A NAME="966"></A>mantle covering the person. If the ownership of possession suffices, then 
<A NAME="967"></A>clearly one must refer to the one category of Possession all objects identified 
<A NAME="968"></A>by being possessed, every case in which possession can be established; 
<A NAME="969"></A>the character of the possessed object will make no difference.
<A NAME="970"></A><BR><BR>If however Possession is not to be predicated of Quality because 
<A NAME="971"></A>Quality stands recognised as a category, nor of Quantity because the category 
<A NAME="972"></A>of Quantity has been received, nor of parts because they have been assigned 
<A NAME="973"></A>to the category of Substance, why should we predicate Possession of weapons, 
<A NAME="974"></A>when they too are comprised in the accepted category of Substance? Shoes 
<A NAME="975"></A>and weapons are clearly substances.
<A NAME="976"></A><BR><BR>How, further, is "He possesses weapons," signifying as it does 
<A NAME="977"></A>that the action of arming has been performed by a subject, to be regarded 
<A NAME="978"></A>as an entirely simple notion, assignable to a single 
<A NAME="979"></A>category?
<A NAME="980"></A><BR><BR>Again, is Possession to be restricted to an animate possessor, 
<A NAME="981"></A>or does it hold good even of a statue as possessing the objects above mentioned? 
<A NAME="982"></A>The animate and inanimate seem to possess in different ways, and the term 
<A NAME="983"></A>is perhaps equivocal. Similarly, "standing" has not the same connotation 
<A NAME="984"></A>as applied to the animate and the inanimate.
<A NAME="985"></A><BR><BR>Besides, how can it be reasonable for what is found only in a limited 
<A NAME="986"></A>number of cases to form a distinct generic category?
<A NAME="987"></A><BR><BR><B>24.</B> There remains Situation, which like Possession is confined 
<A NAME="988"></A>to a few instances such as reclining and sitting.
<A NAME="989"></A><BR><BR>Even so, the term is not used without qualification: we say "they 
<A NAME="990"></A>are placed in such and such a manner," "he is situated in such and such 
<A NAME="991"></A>a position." The position is added from outside the 
<A NAME="992"></A>genus.
<A NAME="993"></A><BR><BR>In short, Situation signifies "being in a place"; there are two 
<A NAME="994"></A>things involved, the position and the place: why then must two categories 
<A NAME="995"></A>be combined into one?
<A NAME="996"></A><BR><BR>Moreover, if sitting signifies an Act, it must be classed among 
<A NAME="997"></A>Acts; if a Passion, it goes under the category to which belong Passions 
<A NAME="998"></A>complete and incomplete.
<A NAME="999"></A><BR><BR>Reclining is surely nothing but "lying up," and tallies with "lying 
<A NAME="1000"></A>down" and "lying midway." But if the reclining belongs thus to the category 
<A NAME="1001"></A>of Relation, why not the recliner also? For as "on the right" belongs to 
<A NAME="1002"></A>the Relations, so does "the thing on the right"; and similarly with "the 
<A NAME="1003"></A>thing on the left."
<A NAME="1004"></A><BR><BR><B>25.</B> There are those who lay down four categories and make 
<A NAME="1005"></A>a fourfold division into Substrates, Qualities, States, and Relative States, 
<A NAME="1006"></A>and find in these a common Something, and so include everything in one 
<A NAME="1007"></A>genus.
<A NAME="1008"></A><BR><BR>Against this theory there is much to be urged, but particularly 
<A NAME="1009"></A>against this posing of a common Something and a single all-embracing genus. 
<A NAME="1010"></A>This Something, it may be submitted, is unintelligible to themselves, is 
<A NAME="1011"></A>indefinable, and does not account either for bodies or for the bodiless. 
<A NAME="1012"></A>Moreover, no room is left for a differentia by which this Something may 
<A NAME="1013"></A>be distinguished. Besides, this common Something is either existent or 
<A NAME="1014"></A>non-existent: if existent, it must be one or other of its [four] species;- 
<A NAME="1015"></A>if non-existent, the existent is classed under the non-existent. But the 
<A NAME="1016"></A>objections are countless; we must leave them for the present and consider 
<A NAME="1017"></A>the several heads of the division.
<A NAME="1018"></A><BR><BR>To the first genus are assigned Substrates, including Matter, to 
<A NAME="1019"></A>which is given a priority over the others; so that what is ranked as the 
<A NAME="1020"></A>first principle comes under the same head with things which must be posterior 
<A NAME="1021"></A>to it since it is their principle.
<A NAME="1022"></A><BR><BR>First, then: the prior is made homogeneous with the subsequent. 
<A NAME="1023"></A>Now this is impossible: in this relation the subsequent owes its existence 
<A NAME="1024"></A>to the prior, whereas among things belonging to one same genus each must 
<A NAME="1025"></A>have, essentially, the equality implied by the genus; for the very meaning 
<A NAME="1026"></A>of genus is to be predicated of the species in respect of their essential 
<A NAME="1027"></A>character. And that Matter is the basic source of all the rest of things, 
<A NAME="1028"></A>this school, we may suppose, would hardly deny.
<A NAME="1029"></A><BR><BR>Secondly: since they treat the Substrate as one thing, they do 
<A NAME="1030"></A>not enumerate the Existents; they look instead for principles of the Existents. 
<A NAME="1031"></A>There is however a difference between speaking of the actual Existents 
<A NAME="1032"></A>and of their principles.
<A NAME="1033"></A><BR><BR>If Matter is taken to be the only Existent, and all other things 
<A NAME="1034"></A>as modifications of Matter, it is not legitimate to set up a single genus 
<A NAME="1035"></A>to embrace both the Existent and the other things; consistency requires 
<A NAME="1036"></A>that Being [Substance] be distinguished from its modifications and that 
<A NAME="1037"></A>these modifications be duly classified.
<A NAME="1038"></A><BR><BR>Even the distinction which this theory makes between Substrates 
<A NAME="1039"></A>and the rest of things is questionable. The Substrate is [necessarily] 
<A NAME="1040"></A>one thing and admits of no differentia- except perhaps in so far as it 
<A NAME="1041"></A>is split up like one mass into its various parts; and yet not even so, 
<A NAME="1042"></A>since the notion of Being implies continuity: it would be better, therefore, 
<A NAME="1043"></A>to speak of the Substrate, in the singular.
<A NAME="1044"></A><BR><BR><B>26.</B> But the error in this theory is fundamental. To set 
<A NAME="1045"></A>Matter the potential above everything, instead of recognising the primacy 
<A NAME="1046"></A>of actuality, is in the highest degree perverse. If the potential holds 
<A NAME="1047"></A>the primacy among the Existents, its actualization becomes impossible; 
<A NAME="1048"></A>it certainly cannot bring itself into actuality: either the actual exists 
<A NAME="1049"></A>previously, and so the potential is not the first-principle, or, if the 
<A NAME="1050"></A>two are to be regarded as existing simultaneously, the first-principles 
<A NAME="1051"></A>must be attributed to hazard. Besides, if they are simultaneous, why is 
<A NAME="1052"></A>not actuality given the primacy? Why is the potential more truly real than 
<A NAME="1053"></A>the actual?
<A NAME="1054"></A><BR><BR>Supposing however that the actual does come later than the potential, 
<A NAME="1055"></A>how must the theory proceed? Obviously Matter does not produce Form: the 
<A NAME="1056"></A>unqualified does not produce Quality, nor does actuality take its origin 
<A NAME="1057"></A>in the potential; for that would mean that the actual was inherent in the 
<A NAME="1058"></A>potential, which at once becomes a dual thing.
<A NAME="1059"></A><BR><BR>Furthermore, God becomes a secondary to Matter, inasmuch as even 
<A NAME="1060"></A>he is regarded as a body composed of Matter and Form- though how he acquires 
<A NAME="1061"></A>the Form is not revealed. If however he be admitted to exist apart from 
<A NAME="1062"></A>Matter in virtue of his character as a principle and a rational law [logos], 
<A NAME="1063"></A>God will be bodiless, the Creative Power bodiless. If we are told that 
<A NAME="1064"></A>he is without Matter but is composite in essence by the fact of being a 
<A NAME="1065"></A>body, this amounts to introducing another Matter, the Matter of 
<A NAME="1066"></A>God.
<A NAME="1067"></A><BR><BR>Again, how can Matter be a first-principle, seeing that it is body? 
<A NAME="1068"></A>Body must necessarily be a plurality, since all bodies are composite of 
<A NAME="1069"></A>Matter and Quality. If however body in this case is to be understood in 
<A NAME="1070"></A>some different way, then Matter is identified with body only by an 
<A NAME="1071"></A>equivocation.
<A NAME="1072"></A><BR><BR>If the possession of three dimensions is given as the characteristic 
<A NAME="1073"></A>of body, then we are dealing simply with mathematical body. If resistance 
<A NAME="1074"></A>is added, we are no longer considering a unity: besides, resistance is 
<A NAME="1075"></A>a quality or at least derived from Quality.
<A NAME="1076"></A><BR><BR>And whence is this resistance supposed to come? Whence the three 
<A NAME="1077"></A>dimensions? What is the source of their existence? Matter is not comprised 
<A NAME="1078"></A>in the concept of the three-dimensional, nor the three-dimensional in the 
<A NAME="1079"></A>concept of Matter; if Matter partakes thus of extension, it can no longer 
<A NAME="1080"></A>be a simplex.
<A NAME="1081"></A><BR><BR>Again, whence does Matter derive its unifying power? It is assuredly 
<A NAME="1082"></A>not the Absolute Unity, but has only that of participation in 
<A NAME="1083"></A>Unity.
<A NAME="1084"></A><BR><BR>We inevitably conclude that Mass or Extension cannot be ranked 
<A NAME="1085"></A>as the first of things; Non-Extension and Unity must be prior. We must 
<A NAME="1086"></A>begin with the One and conclude with the Many, proceed to magnitude from 
<A NAME="1087"></A>that which is free from magnitude: a One is necessary to the existence 
<A NAME="1088"></A>of a Many, Non-Magnitude to that of Magnitude. Magnitude is a unity not 
<A NAME="1089"></A>by being Unity-Absolute, but by participation and in an accidental mode: 
<A NAME="1090"></A>there must be a primary and absolute preceding the accidental, or the accidental 
<A NAME="1091"></A>relation is left unexplained.
<A NAME="1092"></A><BR><BR>The manner of this relation demands investigation. Had this been 
<A NAME="1093"></A>undertaken, the thinkers of this school would probably have lighted upon 
<A NAME="1094"></A>that Unity which is not accidental but essential and 
<A NAME="1095"></A>underived.
<A NAME="1096"></A><BR><BR><B>27.</B> On other grounds also, it is indefensible not to have 
<A NAME="1097"></A>reserved the high place for the true first-principle of things but to have 
<A NAME="1098"></A>set up in its stead the formless, passive and lifeless, the irrational, 
<A NAME="1099"></A>dark and indeterminate, and to have made this the source of Being. In this 
<A NAME="1100"></A>theory God is introduced merely for the sake of appearance: deriving existence 
<A NAME="1101"></A>from Matter he is a composite, a derivative, or, worse, a mere state of 
<A NAME="1102"></A>Matter.
<A NAME="1103"></A><BR><BR>Another consideration is that, if Matter is a substrate, there 
<A NAME="1104"></A>must be something outside it, which, acting on it and distinct from it, 
<A NAME="1105"></A>makes it the substrate of what is poured into it. But if God is lodged 
<A NAME="1106"></A>in Matter and by being involved in Matter is himself no more than a substrate, 
<A NAME="1107"></A>he will no longer make Matter a substrate nor be himself a substrate in 
<A NAME="1108"></A>conjunction with Matter. For of what will they be substrates, when that 
<A NAME="1109"></A>which could make them substrates is eliminated? This so-called substrate 
<A NAME="1110"></A>turns out to have swallowed up all that is; but a substrate must be relative, 
<A NAME="1111"></A>and relative not to its content but to something which acts upon it as 
<A NAME="1112"></A>upon a datum.
<A NAME="1113"></A><BR><BR>Again, the substrate comports a relation to that which is not substrate; 
<A NAME="1114"></A>hence, to something external to it: there must, then, be something apart 
<A NAME="1115"></A>from the substrate. If nothing distinct and external is considered necessary, 
<A NAME="1116"></A>but the substrate itself can become everything and adopt every character, 
<A NAME="1117"></A>like the versatile dancer in the pantomime, it ceases to be a substrate: 
<A NAME="1118"></A>it is, essentially, everything. The mime is not a substrate of the characters 
<A NAME="1119"></A>he puts on; these are in fact the realisation of his own personality: similarly, 
<A NAME="1120"></A>if the Matter with which this theory presents us comports in its own being 
<A NAME="1121"></A>all the realities, it is no longer the substrate of all: on the contrary, 
<A NAME="1122"></A>the other things can have no reality whatever, if they are no more than 
<A NAME="1123"></A>states of Matter in the sense that the poses of the mime are states through 
<A NAME="1124"></A>which he passes.
<A NAME="1125"></A><BR><BR>Then, those other things not existing, Matter will not be a substrate, 
<A NAME="1126"></A>nor will it have a place among the Existents; it will be Matter bare, and 
<A NAME="1127"></A>for that reason not even Matter, since Matter is a relative. The relative 
<A NAME="1128"></A>is relative to something else: it must, further, be homogeneous with that 
<A NAME="1129"></A>something else: double is relative to half, but not Substance to 
<A NAME="1130"></A>double.
<A NAME="1131"></A><BR><BR>How then can an Existent be relative to a Non-existent, except 
<A NAME="1132"></A>accidentally? But the True-Existent, or Matter, is related (to what emerges 
<A NAME="1133"></A>from it) as Existent to Non-Existent. For if potentiality is that which 
<A NAME="1134"></A>holds the promise of existence and that promise does not constitute Reality, 
<A NAME="1135"></A>the potentiality cannot be a Reality. In sum, these very teachers who deprecate 
<A NAME="1136"></A>the production of Realities from Nonrealities, themselves produce Non-reality 
<A NAME="1137"></A>from Reality; for to them the universe as such is not a 
<A NAME="1138"></A>Reality.
<A NAME="1139"></A><BR><BR>But is it not a paradox that, while Matter, the Substrate, is to 
<A NAME="1140"></A>them an existence, bodies should not have more claim to existence, the 
<A NAME="1141"></A>universe yet more, and not merely a claim grounded on the reality of one 
<A NAME="1142"></A>of its parts?
<A NAME="1143"></A><BR><BR>It is no less paradoxical that the living form should owe existence 
<A NAME="1144"></A>not to its soul but to its Matter only, the soul being but an affection 
<A NAME="1145"></A>of Matter and posterior to it. From what source then did Matter receive 
<A NAME="1146"></A>ensoulment? Whence, in short, is soul's entity derived? How does it occur 
<A NAME="1147"></A>that Matter sometimes turns into bodies, while another part of it turns 
<A NAME="1148"></A>into Soul? Even supposing that Form might come to it from elsewhere, that 
<A NAME="1149"></A>accession of Quality to Matter would account not for Soul, but simply for 
<A NAME="1150"></A>organized body soulless. If, on the contrary, there is something which 
<A NAME="1151"></A>b
