<A NAME="10"></A><B>First Tractate</B>
<A NAME="11"></A><BR><BR><B>FATE.</B>
<A NAME="12"></A><BR><BR><B>1.</B> In the two orders of things- those whose existence is 
<A NAME="13"></A>that of process and those in whom it is Authentic Being- there is a variety 
<A NAME="14"></A>of possible relation to Cause.
<A NAME="15"></A><BR><BR>Cause might conceivably underly all the entities in both orders 
<A NAME="16"></A>or none in either. It might underly some, only, in each order, the others 
<A NAME="17"></A>being causeless. It might, again, underly the Realm of Process universally 
<A NAME="18"></A>while in the Realm of Authentic Existence some things were caused, others 
<A NAME="19"></A>not, or all were causeless. Conceivably, on the other hand, the Authentic 
<A NAME="20"></A>Existents are all caused while in the Realm of Process some things are 
<A NAME="21"></A>caused and others not, or all are causeless.
<A NAME="22"></A><BR><BR>Now, to begin with the Eternal Existents:
<A NAME="23"></A><BR>The Firsts among these, by the fact that they are Firsts, cannot be 
<A NAME="24"></A>referred to outside Causes; but all such as depend upon those Firsts may 
<A NAME="25"></A>be admitted to derive their Being from them.
<A NAME="26"></A><BR><BR>And in all cases the Act may be referred to the Essence [as its 
<A NAME="27"></A>cause], for their Essence consists, precisely, in giving forth an appropriate 
<A NAME="28"></A>Act.
<A NAME="29"></A><BR><BR>As for Things of Process- or for Eternal Existents whose Act is 
<A NAME="30"></A>not eternally invariable- we must hold that these are due to Cause; Causelessness 
<A NAME="31"></A>is quite inadmissible; we can make no place here for unwarranted "slantings," 
<A NAME="32"></A>for sudden movement of bodies apart from any initiating power, for precipitate 
<A NAME="33"></A>spurts in a soul with nothing to drive it into the new course of action. 
<A NAME="34"></A>Such causelessness would bind the Soul under an even sterner compulsion, 
<A NAME="35"></A>no longer master of itself, but at the mercy of movements apart from will 
<A NAME="36"></A>and cause. Something willed- within itself or without- something desired, 
<A NAME="37"></A>must lead it to action; without motive it can have no 
<A NAME="38"></A>motion.
<A NAME="39"></A><BR><BR>On the assumption that all happens by Cause, it is easy to discover 
<A NAME="40"></A>the nearest determinants of any particular act or state and to trace it 
<A NAME="41"></A>plainly to them.
<A NAME="42"></A><BR><BR>The cause of a visit to the centre of affairs will be that one 
<A NAME="43"></A>thinks it necessary to see some person or to receive a debt, or, in a word, 
<A NAME="44"></A>that one has some definite motive or impulse confirmed by a judgement of 
<A NAME="45"></A>expediency. Sometimes a condition may be referred to the arts, the recovery 
<A NAME="46"></A>of health for instance to medical science and the doctor. Wealth has for 
<A NAME="47"></A>its cause the discovery of a treasure or the receipt of a gift, or the 
<A NAME="48"></A>earning of money by manual or intellectual labour. The child is traced 
<A NAME="49"></A>to the father as its Cause and perhaps to a chain of favourable outside 
<A NAME="50"></A>circumstances such as a particular diet or, more immediately, a special 
<A NAME="51"></A>organic aptitude or a wife apt to childbirth.
<A NAME="52"></A><BR><BR>And the general cause of all is Nature.
<A NAME="53"></A><BR><B>2.</B> But to halt at these nearest determinants, not to be willing 
<A NAME="54"></A>to penetrate deeper, indicates a sluggish mind, a dullness to all that 
<A NAME="55"></A>calls us towards the primal and transcendent causes.
<A NAME="56"></A><BR><BR>How comes it that the same surface causes produce different results? 
<A NAME="57"></A>There is moonshine, and one man steals and the other does not: under the 
<A NAME="58"></A>influence of exactly similar surroundings one man falls sick and the other 
<A NAME="59"></A>keeps well; an identical set of operations makes one rich and leaves another 
<A NAME="60"></A>poor. The differences amongst us in manners, in characters, in success, 
<A NAME="61"></A>force us to go still further back.
<A NAME="62"></A><BR><BR>Men therefore have never been able to rest at the surface 
<A NAME="63"></A>causes.
<A NAME="64"></A><BR>One school postulates material principles, such as atoms; from the 
<A NAME="65"></A>movement, from the collisions and combinations of these, it derives the 
<A NAME="66"></A>existence and the mode of being of all particular phenomena, supposing 
<A NAME="67"></A>that all depends upon how these atoms are agglomerated, how they act, how 
<A NAME="68"></A>they are affected; our own impulses and states, even, are supposed to be 
<A NAME="69"></A>determined by these principles.
<A NAME="70"></A><BR><BR>Such teaching, then, obtrudes this compulsion, an atomic Anagke, 
<A NAME="71"></A>even upon Real Being. Substitute, for the atoms, any other material entities 
<A NAME="72"></A>as principles and the cause of all things, and at once Real Being becomes 
<A NAME="73"></A>servile to the determination set up by them.
<A NAME="74"></A><BR><BR>Others rise to the first-principle of all that exists and from 
<A NAME="75"></A>it derive all they tell of a cause penetrating all things, not merely moving 
<A NAME="76"></A>all but making each and everything; but they pose this as a fate and a 
<A NAME="77"></A>supremely dominating cause; not merely all else that comes into being, 
<A NAME="78"></A>but even our own thinking and thoughts would spring from its movement, 
<A NAME="79"></A>just as the several members of an animal move not at their own choice but 
<A NAME="80"></A>at the dictation of the leading principle which animal life 
<A NAME="81"></A>presupposes.
<A NAME="82"></A><BR><BR>Yet another school fastens on the universal Circuit as embracing 
<A NAME="83"></A>all things and producing all by its motion and by the positions and mutual 
<A NAME="84"></A>aspect of the planets and fixed stars in whose power of foretelling they 
<A NAME="85"></A>find warrant for the belief that this Circuit is the universal 
<A NAME="86"></A>determinant.
<A NAME="87"></A><BR><BR>Finally, there are those that dwell on the interconnection of the 
<A NAME="88"></A>causative forces and on their linked descent- every later phenomenon following 
<A NAME="89"></A>upon an earlier, one always leading back to others by which it arose and 
<A NAME="90"></A>without which it could not be, and the latest always subservient to what 
<A NAME="91"></A>went before them- but this is obviously to bring in fate by another path. 
<A NAME="92"></A>This school may be fairly distinguished into two branches; a section which 
<A NAME="93"></A>makes all depend upon some one principle and a section which ignores such 
<A NAME="94"></A>a unity.
<A NAME="95"></A><BR><BR>Of this last opinion we will have something to say, but for the 
<A NAME="96"></A>moment we will deal with the former, taking the others in their 
<A NAME="97"></A>turn.
<A NAME="98"></A><BR><BR>3. "Atoms" or "elements"- it is in either case an absurdity, an 
<A NAME="99"></A>impossibility, to hand over the universe and its contents to material entities, 
<A NAME="100"></A>and out of the disorderly swirl thus occasioned to call order, reasoning, 
<A NAME="101"></A>and the governing soul into being; but the atomic origin is, if we may 
<A NAME="102"></A>use the phrase, the most impossible.
<A NAME="103"></A><BR><BR>A good deal of truth has resulted from the discussion of this subject; 
<A NAME="104"></A>but, even to admit such principles does not compel us to admit universal 
<A NAME="105"></A>compulsion or any kind of "fate."
<A NAME="106"></A><BR><BR>Suppose the atoms to exist:
<A NAME="107"></A><BR>These atoms are to move, one downwards- admitting a down and an up- 
<A NAME="108"></A>another slant-wise, all at haphazard, in a confused conflict. Nothing here 
<A NAME="109"></A>is orderly; order has not come into being, though the outcome, this Universe, 
<A NAME="110"></A>when it achieves existence, is all order; and thus prediction and divination 
<A NAME="111"></A>are utterly impossible, whether by the laws of the science- what science 
<A NAME="112"></A>can operate where there is no order?- or by divine possession and inspiration, 
<A NAME="113"></A>which no less require that the future be something regulated.
<A NAME="114"></A><BR><BR>Material entities exposed to all this onslaught may very well be 
<A NAME="115"></A>under compulsion to yield to whatsoever the atoms may bring: but would 
<A NAME="116"></A>anyone pretend that the acts and states of a soul or mind could be explained 
<A NAME="117"></A>by any atomic movements? How can we imagine that the onslaught of an atom, 
<A NAME="118"></A>striking downwards or dashing in from any direction, could force the soul 
<A NAME="119"></A>to definite and necessary reasonings or impulses or into any reasonings, 
<A NAME="120"></A>impulses or thoughts at all, necessary or otherwise? And what of the soul's 
<A NAME="121"></A>resistance to bodily states? What movement of atoms could compel one man 
<A NAME="122"></A>to be a geometrician, set another studying arithmetic or astronomy, lead 
<A NAME="123"></A>a third to the philosophic life? In a word, if we must go, like soulless 
<A NAME="124"></A>bodies, wherever bodies push and drive us, there is an end to our personal 
<A NAME="125"></A>act and to our very existence as living beings.
<A NAME="126"></A><BR><BR>The School that erects other material forces into universal causes 
<A NAME="127"></A>is met by the same reasoning: we say that while these can warm us and chill 
<A NAME="128"></A>us, and destroy weaker forms of existence, they can be causes of nothing 
<A NAME="129"></A>that is done in the sphere of mind or soul: all this must be traceable 
<A NAME="130"></A>to quite another kind of Principle.
<A NAME="131"></A><BR><BR><B>4.</B> Another theory:
<A NAME="132"></A><BR>The Universe is permeated by one Soul, Cause of all things and events; 
<A NAME="133"></A>every separate phenomenon as a member of a whole moves in its place with 
<A NAME="134"></A>the general movement; all the various causes spring into action from one 
<A NAME="135"></A>source: therefore, it is argued, the entire descending claim of causes 
<A NAME="136"></A>and all their interaction must follow inevitably and so constitute a universal 
<A NAME="137"></A>determination. A plant rises from a root, and we are asked on that account 
<A NAME="138"></A>to reason that not only the interconnection linking the root to all the 
<A NAME="139"></A>members and every member to every other but the entire activity and experience 
<A NAME="140"></A>of the plant, as well, must be one organized overruling, a "destiny" of 
<A NAME="141"></A>the plant.
<A NAME="142"></A><BR><BR>But such an extremity of determination, a destiny so all-pervasive, 
<A NAME="143"></A>does away with the very destiny that is affirmed: it shatters the sequence 
<A NAME="144"></A>and co-operation of causes.
<A NAME="145"></A><BR><BR>It would be unreasonable to attribute to destiny the movement of 
<A NAME="146"></A>our limbs dictated by the mind and will: this is no case of something outside 
<A NAME="147"></A>bestowing motion while another thing accepts it and is thus set into action; 
<A NAME="148"></A>the mind itself is the prime mover.
<A NAME="149"></A><BR><BR>Similarly in the case of the universal system; if all that performs 
<A NAME="150"></A>act and is subject to experience constitutes one substance, if one thing 
<A NAME="151"></A>does not really produce another thing under causes leading back continuously 
<A NAME="152"></A>one to another, then it is not a truth that all happens by causes, there 
<A NAME="153"></A>is nothing but a rigid unity. We are no "We": nothing is our act; our thought 
<A NAME="154"></A>is not ours; our decisions are the reasoning of something outside ourselves; 
<A NAME="155"></A>we are no more agents than our feet are kickers when we use them to kick 
<A NAME="156"></A>with.
<A NAME="157"></A><BR><BR>No; each several thing must be a separate thing; there must be 
<A NAME="158"></A>acts and thoughts that are our own; the good and evil done by each human 
<A NAME="159"></A>being must be his own; and it is quite certain that we must not lay any 
<A NAME="160"></A>vileness to the charge of the All.
<A NAME="161"></A><BR><BR><B>5.</B> But perhaps the explanation of every particular act or 
<A NAME="162"></A>event is rather that they are determined by the spheric movement- the Phora- 
<A NAME="163"></A>and by the changing position of the heavenly bodies as these stand at setting 
<A NAME="164"></A>or rising or in mid-course and in various aspects with each 
<A NAME="165"></A>other.
<A NAME="166"></A><BR><BR>Augury, it is urged, is able from these indications to foretell 
<A NAME="167"></A>what is to happen not merely to the universe as a whole, but even to individuals, 
<A NAME="168"></A>and this not merely as regards external conditions of fortune but even 
<A NAME="169"></A>as to the events of the mind. We observe, too, how growth or check in other 
<A NAME="170"></A>orders of beings- animals and Plants- is determined by their sympathetic 
<A NAME="171"></A>relations with the heavenly bodies and how widely they are influenced by 
<A NAME="172"></A>them, how, for example, the various countries show a different produce 
<A NAME="173"></A>according to their situation on the earth and especially their lie towards 
<A NAME="174"></A>the sun. And the effect of place is not limited to plants and animals; 
<A NAME="175"></A>it rules human beings too, determining their appearance, their height and 
<A NAME="176"></A>colour, their mentality and their desires, their pursuits and their moral 
<A NAME="177"></A>habit. Thus the universal circuit would seem to be the monarch of the 
<A NAME="178"></A>All.
<A NAME="179"></A><BR><BR>Now a first answer to this theory is that its advocates have merely 
<A NAME="180"></A>devised another shift to immolate to the heavenly bodies all that is ours, 
<A NAME="181"></A>our acts of will and our states, all the evil in us, our entire personality; 
<A NAME="182"></A>nothing is allowed to us; we are left to be stones set rolling, not men, 
<A NAME="183"></A>not beings whose nature implies a task.
<A NAME="184"></A><BR><BR>But we must be allowed our own- with the understanding that to 
<A NAME="185"></A>what is primarily ours, our personal holding, there is added some influx 
<A NAME="186"></A>from the All- the distinction must be made between our individual act and 
<A NAME="187"></A>what is thrust upon us: we are not to be immolated to the 
<A NAME="188"></A>stars.
<A NAME="189"></A><BR><BR>Place and climate, no doubt, produce constitutions warmer or colder; 
<A NAME="190"></A>and the parents tell on the offspring, as is seen in the resemblance between 
<A NAME="191"></A>them, very general in personal appearance and noted also in some of the 
<A NAME="192"></A>unreflecting states of the mind.
<A NAME="193"></A><BR><BR>None the less, in spite of physical resemblance and similar environment, 
<A NAME="194"></A>we observe the greatest difference in temperament and in ideas: this side 
<A NAME="195"></A>of the human being, then, derives from some quite other Principle [than 
<A NAME="196"></A>any external causation or destiny]. A further confirmation is found in 
<A NAME="197"></A>the efforts we make to correct both bodily constitution and mental 
<A NAME="198"></A>aspirations.
<A NAME="199"></A><BR><BR>If the stars are held to be causing principles on the ground of 
<A NAME="200"></A>the possibility of foretelling individual fate or fortune from observation 
<A NAME="201"></A>of their positions, then the birds and all the other things which the soothsayer 
<A NAME="202"></A>observes for divination must equally be taken as causing what they 
<A NAME="203"></A>indicate.
<A NAME="204"></A><BR><BR>Some further considerations will help to clarify this 
<A NAME="205"></A>matter:
<A NAME="206"></A><BR>The heavens are observed at the moment of a birth and the individual 
<A NAME="207"></A>fate is thence predicted in the idea that the stars are no mere indications, 
<A NAME="208"></A>but active causes, of the future events. Sometimes the Astrologers tell 
<A NAME="209"></A>of noble birth; "the child is born of highly placed parents"; yet how is 
<A NAME="210"></A>it possible to make out the stars to be causes of a condition which existed 
<A NAME="211"></A>in the father and mother previously to that star pattern on which the prediction 
<A NAME="212"></A>is based?
<A NAME="213"></A><BR><BR>And consider still further:
<A NAME="214"></A><BR>They are really announcing the fortunes of parents from the birth of 
<A NAME="215"></A>children; the character and career of children are included in the predictions 
<A NAME="216"></A>as to the parents- they predict for the yet unborn!- in the lot of one 
<A NAME="217"></A>brother they are foretelling the death of another; a girl's fate includes 
<A NAME="218"></A>that of a future husband, a boy's that of a wife.
<A NAME="219"></A><BR><BR>Now, can we think that the star-grouping over any particular birth 
<A NAME="220"></A>can be the cause of what stands already announced in the facts about the 
<A NAME="221"></A>parents? Either the previous star-groupings were the determinants of the 
<A NAME="222"></A>child's future career or, if they were not, then neither is the immediate 
<A NAME="223"></A>grouping. And notice further that physical likeness to the parents- the 
<A NAME="224"></A>Astrologers hold- is of purely domestic origin: this implies that ugliness 
<A NAME="225"></A>and beauty are so caused and not by astral movements.
<A NAME="226"></A><BR><BR>Again, there must at one and the same time be a widespread coming 
<A NAME="227"></A>to birth- men, and the most varied forms of animal life at the same moment- 
<A NAME="228"></A>and these should all be under the one destiny since the one pattern rules 
<A NAME="229"></A>at the moment; how explain that identical star-groupings give here the 
<A NAME="230"></A>human form, there the animal?
<A NAME="231"></A><BR><BR><B>6.</B> But in fact everything follows its own Kind; the birth 
<A NAME="232"></A>is a horse because it comes from the Horse Kind, a man by springing from 
<A NAME="233"></A>the Human Kind; offspring answers to species. Allow the kosmic circuit 
<A NAME="234"></A>its part, a very powerful influence upon the thing brought into being: 
<A NAME="235"></A>allow the stars a wide material action upon the bodily part of the man, 
<A NAME="236"></A>producing heat and cold and their natural resultants in the physical constitution; 
<A NAME="237"></A>still does such action explain character, vocation and especially all that 
<A NAME="238"></A>seems quite independent of material elements, a man taking to letters, 
<A NAME="239"></A>to geometry, to gambling, and becoming an originator in any of these pursuits? 
<A NAME="240"></A>And can we imagine the stars, divine beings, bestowing wickedness? And 
<A NAME="241"></A>what of a doctrine that makes them wreak vengeance, as for a wrong, because 
<A NAME="242"></A>they are in their decline or are being carried to a position beneath the 
<A NAME="243"></A>earth- as if a decline from our point of view brought any change to themselves, 
<A NAME="244"></A>as if they ever ceased to traverse the heavenly spheres and to make the 
<A NAME="245"></A>same figure around the earth.
<A NAME="246"></A><BR><BR>Nor may we think that these divine beings lose or gain in goodness 
<A NAME="247"></A>as they see this one or another of the company in various aspects, and 
<A NAME="248"></A>that in their happier position they are benignant to us and, less pleasantly 
<A NAME="249"></A>situated, turn maleficent. We can but believe that their circuit is for 
<A NAME="250"></A>the protection of the entirety of things while they furnish the incidental 
<A NAME="251"></A>service of being letters on which the augur, acquainted with that alphabet, 
<A NAME="252"></A>may look and read the future from their pattern- arriving at the thing 
<A NAME="253"></A>signified by such analogies as that a soaring bird tells of some lofty 
<A NAME="254"></A>event.
<A NAME="255"></A><BR><BR><B>7.</B> It remains to notice the theory of the one Causing-Principle 
<A NAME="256"></A>alleged to interweave everything with everything else, to make things into 
<A NAME="257"></A>a chain, to determine the nature and condition of each phenomenon- a Principle 
<A NAME="258"></A>which, acting through seminal Reason-Forms- Logoi Spermatikoi- elaborates 
<A NAME="259"></A>all that exists and happens.
<A NAME="260"></A><BR><BR>The doctrine is close to that which makes the Soul of the Universe 
<A NAME="261"></A>the source and cause of all condition and of all movement whether without 
<A NAME="262"></A>or- supposing that we are allowed as individuals some little power towards 
<A NAME="263"></A>personal act- within ourselves.
<A NAME="264"></A><BR><BR>But it is the theory of the most rigid and universal Necessity: 
<A NAME="265"></A>all the causative forces enter into the system, and so every several phenomenon 
<A NAME="266"></A>rises necessarily; where nothing escapes Destiny, nothing has power to 
<A NAME="267"></A>check or to change. Such forces beating upon us, as it were, from one general 
<A NAME="268"></A>cause leave us no resource but to go where they drive. All our ideas will 
<A NAME="269"></A>be determined by a chain of previous causes; our doings will be determined 
<A NAME="270"></A>by those ideas; personal action becomes a mere word. That we are the agents 
<A NAME="271"></A>does not save our freedom when our action is prescribed by those causes; 
<A NAME="272"></A>we have precisely what belongs to everything that lives, to infants guided 
<A NAME="273"></A>by blind impulses, to lunatics; all these act; why, even fire acts; there 
<A NAME="274"></A>is act in everything that follows the plan of its being, 
<A NAME="275"></A>servilely.
<A NAME="276"></A><BR><BR>No one that sees the implications of this theory can hesitate: 
<A NAME="277"></A>unable to halt at such a determinant principle, we seek for other explanations 
<A NAME="278"></A>of our action.
<A NAME="279"></A><BR><BR><B>8.</B> What can this other cause be; one standing above those 
<A NAME="280"></A>treated of; one that leaves nothing causeless, that preserves sequence 
<A NAME="281"></A>and order in the Universe and yet allows ourselves some reality and leaves 
<A NAME="282"></A>room for prediction and augury?
<A NAME="283"></A><BR><BR>Soul: we must place at the crest of the world of beings, this other 
<A NAME="284"></A>Principle, not merely the Soul of the Universe but, included in it, the 
<A NAME="285"></A>Soul of the individual: this, no mean Principle, is needed to be the bond 
<A NAME="286"></A>of union in the total of things, not, itself, a thing sprung like things 
<A NAME="287"></A>from life-seeds, but a first-hand Cause, bodiless and therefore supreme 
<A NAME="288"></A>over itself, free, beyond the reach of kosmic Cause: for, brought into 
<A NAME="289"></A>body, it would not be unrestrictedly sovereign; it would hold rank in a 
<A NAME="290"></A>series.
<A NAME="291"></A><BR><BR>Now the environment into which this independent principle enters, 
<A NAME="292"></A>when it comes to this midpoint, will be largely led by secondary causes 
<A NAME="293"></A>[or, by chance-causes]: there will therefore be a compromise; the action 
<A NAME="294"></A>of the Soul will be in part guided by this environment while in other matters 
<A NAME="295"></A>it will be sovereign, leading the way where it will. The nobler Soul will 
<A NAME="296"></A>have the greater power; the poorer Soul, the lesser. A soul which defers 
<A NAME="297"></A>to the bodily temperament cannot escape desire and rage and is abject in 
<A NAME="298"></A>poverty, overbearing in wealth, arbitrary in power. The soul of nobler 
<A NAME="299"></A>nature holds good against its surroundings; it is more apt to change them 
<A NAME="300"></A>than to be changed, so that often it improves the environment and, where 
<A NAME="301"></A>it must make concession, at least keeps its innocence.
<A NAME="302"></A><BR><BR><B>9.</B> We admit, then, a Necessity in all that is brought about 
<A NAME="303"></A>by this compromise between evil and accidental circumstance: what room 
<A NAME="304"></A>was there for anything else than the thing that is? Given all the causes, 
<A NAME="305"></A>all must happen beyond aye or nay- that is, all the external and whatever 
<A NAME="306"></A>may be due to the sidereal circuit- therefore when the Soul has been modified 
<A NAME="307"></A>by outer forces and acts under that pressure so that what it does is no 
<A NAME="308"></A>more than an unreflecting acceptance of stimulus, neither the act nor the 
<A NAME="309"></A>state can be described as voluntary: so, too, when even from within itself, 
<A NAME="310"></A>it falls at times below its best and ignores the true, the highest, laws 
<A NAME="311"></A>of action.
<A NAME="312"></A><BR><BR>But when our Soul holds to its Reason-Principle, to the guide, 
<A NAME="313"></A>pure and detached and native to itself, only then can we speak of personal 
<A NAME="314"></A>operation, of voluntary act. Things so done may truly be described as our 
<A NAME="315"></A>doing, for they have no other source; they are the issue of the unmingled 
<A NAME="316"></A>Soul, a Principle that is a First, a leader, a sovereign not subject to 
<A NAME="317"></A>the errors of ignorance, not to be overthrown by the tyranny of the desires 
<A NAME="318"></A>which, where they can break in, drive and drag, so as to allow of no act 
<A NAME="319"></A>of ours, but mere answer to stimulus.
<A NAME="320"></A><BR><BR><B>10.</B> To sum the results of our argument: All things and events 
<A NAME="321"></A>are foreshown and brought into being by causes; but the causation is of 
<A NAME="322"></A>two Kinds; there are results originating from the Soul and results due 
<A NAME="323"></A>to other causes, those of the environment.
<A NAME="324"></A><BR><BR>In the action of our Souls all that is done of their own motion 
<A NAME="325"></A>in the light of sound reason is the Soul's work, while what is done where 
<A NAME="326"></A>they are hindered from their own action is not so much done as suffered. 
<A NAME="327"></A>Unwisdom, then, is not due to the Soul, and, in general- if we mean by 
<A NAME="328"></A>Fate a compulsion outside ourselves- an act is fated when it is contrary 
<A NAME="329"></A>to wisdom.
<A NAME="330"></A><BR><BR>But all our best is of our own doing: such is our nature as long 
<A NAME="331"></A>as we remain detached. The wise and good do perform acts; their right action 
<A NAME="332"></A>is the expression of their own power: in the others it comes in the breathing 
<A NAME="333"></A>spaces when the passions are in abeyance; but it is not that they draw 
<A NAME="334"></A>this occasional wisdom from outside themselves; simply, they are for the 
<A NAME="335"></A>time being unhindered.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="336"></A><B>Second Tractate</B>

<A NAME="337"></A><BR><BR><B>ON PROVIDENCE (1).</B>
<A NAME="338"></A><BR><BR><B>1.</B> To make the existence and coherent structure of this 
<A NAME="339"></A>Universe depend upon automatic activity and upon chance is against all 
<A NAME="340"></A>good sense.
<A NAME="341"></A><BR><BR>Such a notion could be entertained only where there is neither 
<A NAME="342"></A>intelligence nor even ordinary perception; and reason enough has been urged 
<A NAME="343"></A>against it, though none is really necessary.
<A NAME="344"></A><BR><BR>But there is still the question as to the process by which the 
<A NAME="345"></A>individual things of this sphere have come into being, how they were 
<A NAME="346"></A>made.
<A NAME="347"></A><BR><BR>Some of them seem so undesirable as to cast doubts upon a Universal 
<A NAME="348"></A>Providence; and we find, on the one hand, the denial of any controlling 
<A NAME="349"></A>power, on the other the belief that the Kosmos is the work of an evil 
<A NAME="350"></A>creator.
<A NAME="351"></A><BR><BR>This matter must be examined through and through from the very 
<A NAME="352"></A>first principles. We may, however, omit for the present any consideration 
<A NAME="353"></A>of the particular providence, that beforehand decision which accomplishes 
<A NAME="354"></A>or holds things in abeyance to some good purpose and gives or withholds 
<A NAME="355"></A>in our own regard: when we have established the Universal Providence which 
<A NAME="356"></A>we affirm, we can link the secondary with it.
<A NAME="357"></A><BR><BR>Of course the belief that after a certain lapse of time a Kosmos 
<A NAME="358"></A>previously non-existent came into being would imply a foreseeing and a 
<A NAME="359"></A>reasoned plan on the part of God providing for the production of the Universe 
<A NAME="360"></A>and securing all possible perfection in it- a guidance and partial providence, 
<A NAME="361"></A>therefore, such as is indicated. But since we hold the eternal existence 
<A NAME="362"></A>of the Universe, the utter absence of a beginning to it, we are forced, 
<A NAME="363"></A>in sound and sequent reasoning, to explain the providence ruling in the 
<A NAME="364"></A>Universe as a universal consonance with the divine Intelligence to which 
<A NAME="365"></A>the Kosmos is subsequent not in time but in the fact of derivation, in 
<A NAME="366"></A>the fact that the Divine Intelligence, preceding it in Kind, is its cause 
<A NAME="367"></A>as being the Archetype and Model which it merely images, the primal by 
<A NAME="368"></A>which, from all eternity, it has its existence and subsistence.
<A NAME="369"></A><BR><BR>The relationship may be presented thus:
<A NAME="370"></A><BR>The authentic and primal Kosmos is the Being of the Intellectual Principle 
<A NAME="371"></A>and of the Veritable Existent. This contains within itself no spatial distinction, 
<A NAME="372"></A>and has none of the feebleness of division, and even its parts bring no 
<A NAME="373"></A>incompleteness to it since here the individual is not severed from the 
<A NAME="374"></A>entire. In this Nature inheres all life and all intellect, a life living 
<A NAME="375"></A>and having intellection as one act within a unity: every part that it gives 
<A NAME="376"></A>forth is a whole; all its content is its very own, for there is here no 
<A NAME="377"></A>separation of thing from thing, no part standing in isolated existence 
<A NAME="378"></A>estranged from the rest, and therefore nowhere is there any wronging of 
<A NAME="379"></A>any other, any opposition. Everywhere one and complete, it is at rest throughout 
<A NAME="380"></A>and shows difference at no point; it does not make over any of its content 
<A NAME="381"></A>into any new form; there can be no reason for changing what is everywhere 
<A NAME="382"></A>perfect.
<A NAME="383"></A><BR><BR>Why should Reason elaborate yet another Reason, or Intelligence 
<A NAME="384"></A>another Intelligence? An indwelling power of making things is in the character 
<A NAME="385"></A>of a being not at all points as it should be but making, moving, by reason 
<A NAME="386"></A>of some failure in quality. Those whose nature is all blessedness have 
<A NAME="387"></A>no more to do than to repose in themselves and be their 
<A NAME="388"></A>being.
<A NAME="389"></A><BR><BR>A widespread activity is dangerous to those who must go out from 
<A NAME="390"></A>themselves to act. But such is the blessedness of this Being that in its 
<A NAME="391"></A>very non-action it magnificently operates and in its self-dwelling it produces 
<A NAME="392"></A>mightily.
<A NAME="393"></A><BR><BR><B>2.</B> By derivation from that Authentic Kosmos, one within 
<A NAME="394"></A>itself, there subsists this lower kosmos, no longer a true 
<A NAME="395"></A>unity.
<A NAME="396"></A><BR><BR>It is multiple, divided into various elements, thing standing apart 
<A NAME="397"></A>from thing in a new estrangement. No longer is there concord unbroken; 
<A NAME="398"></A>hostility, too, has entered as the result of difference and distance; imperfection 
<A NAME="399"></A>has inevitably introduced discord; for a part is not self-sufficient, it 
<A NAME="400"></A>must pursue something outside itself for its fulfillment, and so it becomes 
<A NAME="401"></A>the enemy to what it needs.
<A NAME="402"></A><BR><BR>This Kosmos of parts has come into being not as the result of a 
<A NAME="403"></A>judgement establishing its desirability, but by the sheer necessity of 
<A NAME="404"></A>a secondary Kind.
<A NAME="405"></A><BR><BR>The Intellectual Realm was not of a nature to be the ultimate of 
<A NAME="406"></A>existents. It was the First and it held great power, all there is of power; 
<A NAME="407"></A>this means that it is productive without seeking to produce; for if effort 
<A NAME="408"></A>and search were incumbent upon it, the Act would not be its own, would 
<A NAME="409"></A>not spring from its essential nature; it would be, like a craftsman, producing 
<A NAME="410"></A>by a power not inherent but acquired, mastered by dint of 
<A NAME="411"></A>study.
<A NAME="412"></A><BR><BR>The Intellectual Principle, then, in its unperturbed serenity has 
<A NAME="413"></A>brought the universe into being, by communicating from its own store to 
<A NAME="414"></A>Matter: and this gift is the Reason-Form flowing from it. For the Emanation 
<A NAME="415"></A>of the Intellectual Principle is Reason, an emanation unfailing as long 
<A NAME="416"></A>as the Intellectual Principle continues to have place among 
<A NAME="417"></A>beings.
<A NAME="418"></A><BR><BR>The Reason-Principle within a seed contains all the parts and qualities 
<A NAME="419"></A>concentrated in identity; there is no distinction, no jarring, no internal 
<A NAME="420"></A>hindering; then there comes a pushing out into bulk, part rises in distinction 
<A NAME="421"></A>with part, and at once the members of the organism stand in each other's 
<A NAME="422"></A>way and begin to wear each other down.
<A NAME="423"></A><BR><BR>So from this, the One Intellectual Principle, and the Reason-Form 
<A NAME="424"></A>emanating from it, our Universe rises and develops part, and inevitably 
<A NAME="425"></A>are formed groups concordant and helpful in contrast with groups discordant 
<A NAME="426"></A>and combative; sometimes of choice and sometimes incidentally, the parts 
<A NAME="427"></A>maltreat each other; engendering proceeds by destruction.
<A NAME="428"></A><BR><BR>Yet: Amid all that they effect and accept, the divine Realm imposes 
<A NAME="429"></A>the one harmonious act; each utters its own voice, but all is brought into 
<A NAME="430"></A>accord, into an ordered system, for the universal purpose, by the ruling 
<A NAME="431"></A>Reason-Principle. This Universe is not Intelligence and Reason, like the 
<A NAME="432"></A>Supernal, but participant in Intelligence and Reason: it stands in need 
<A NAME="433"></A>of the harmonizing because it is the meeting ground of Necessity and divine 
<A NAME="434"></A>Reason-Necessity pulling towards the lower, towards the unreason which 
<A NAME="435"></A>is its own characteristic, while yet the Intellectual Principle remains 
<A NAME="436"></A>sovereign over it.
<A NAME="437"></A><BR><BR>The Intellectual Sphere [the Divine] alone is Reason, and there 
<A NAME="438"></A>can never be another Sphere that is Reason and nothing else; so that, given 
<A NAME="439"></A>some other system, it cannot be as noble as that first; it cannot be Reason: 
<A NAME="440"></A>yet since such a system cannot be merely Matter, which is the utterly unordered, 
<A NAME="441"></A>it must be a mixed thing. Its two extremes are Matter and the Divine Reason; 
<A NAME="442"></A>its governing principle is Soul, presiding over the conjunction of the 
<A NAME="443"></A>two, and to be thought of not as labouring in the task but as administering 
<A NAME="444"></A>serenely by little more than an act of presence.
<A NAME="445"></A><BR><BR><B>3.</B> Nor would it be sound to condemn this Kosmos as less 
<A NAME="446"></A>than beautiful, as less than the noblest possible in the corporeal; and 
<A NAME="447"></A>neither can any charge be laid against its source.
<A NAME="448"></A><BR><BR>The world, we must reflect, is a product of Necessity, not of deliberate 
<A NAME="449"></A>purpose: it is due to a higher Kind engendering in its own likeness by 
<A NAME="450"></A>a natural process. And none the less, a second consideration, if a considered 
<A NAME="451"></A>plan brought it into being it would still be no disgrace to its maker- 
<A NAME="452"></A>for it stands a stately whole, complete within itself, serving at once 
<A NAME="453"></A>its own purpose and that of all its parts which, leading and lesser alike, 
<A NAME="454"></A>are of such a nature as to further the interests of the total. It is, therefore, 
<A NAME="455"></A>impossible to condemn the whole on the merits of the parts which, besides, 
<A NAME="456"></A>must be judged only as they enter harmoniously or not into the whole, the 
<A NAME="457"></A>main consideration, quite overpassing the members which thus cease to have 
<A NAME="458"></A>importance. To linger about the parts is to condemn not the Kosmos but 
<A NAME="459"></A>some isolated appendage of it; in the entire living Being we fasten our 
<A NAME="460"></A>eyes on a hair or a toe neglecting the marvellous spectacle of the complete 
<A NAME="461"></A>Man; we ignore all the tribes and kinds of animals except for the meanest; 
<A NAME="462"></A>we pass over an entire race, humanity, and bring forward- 
<A NAME="463"></A>Thersites.
<A NAME="464"></A><BR><BR>No: this thing that has come into Being is the Kosmos complete: 
<A NAME="465"></A>do but survey it, and surely this is the pleading you will 
<A NAME="466"></A>hear:
<A NAME="467"></A><BR><BR>I am made by a God: from that God I came perfect above all forms 
<A NAME="468"></A>of life, adequate to my function, self-sufficing, lacking nothing: for 
<A NAME="469"></A>I am the container of all, that is, of every plant and every animal, of 
<A NAME="470"></A>all the Kinds of created things, and many Gods and nations of Spirit-Beings 
<A NAME="471"></A>and lofty souls and men happy in their goodness.
<A NAME="472"></A><BR><BR>And do not think that, while earth is ornate with all its growths 
<A NAME="473"></A>and with living things of every race, and while the very sea has answered 
<A NAME="474"></A>to the power of Soul, do not think that the great air and the ether and 
<A NAME="475"></A>the far-spread heavens remain void of it: there it is that all good Souls 
<A NAME="476"></A>dwell, infusing life into the stars and into that orderly eternal circuit 
<A NAME="477"></A>of the heavens which in its conscious movement ever about the one Centre, 
<A NAME="478"></A>seeking nothing beyond, is a faithful copy of the divine Mind. And all 
<A NAME="479"></A>that is within me strives towards the Good; and each, to the measure of 
<A NAME="480"></A>its faculty, attains. For from that Good all the heavens depend, with all 
<A NAME="481"></A>my own Soul and the Gods that dwell in my every part, and all that lives 
<A NAME="482"></A>and grows, and even all in me that you may judge inanimate.
<A NAME="483"></A><BR><BR>But there are degrees of participation: here no more than Existence, 
<A NAME="484"></A>elsewhere Life; and, in Life, sometimes mainly that of Sensation, higher 
<A NAME="485"></A>again that of Reason, finally Life in all its fullness. We have no right 
<A NAME="486"></A>to demand equal powers in the unequal: the finger is not to be asked to 
<A NAME="487"></A>see; there is the eye for that; a finger has its own business- to be finger 
<A NAME="488"></A>and have finger power.
<A NAME="489"></A><BR><BR><B>4.</B> That water extinguishes fire and fire consumes other 
<A NAME="490"></A>things should not astonish us. The thing destroyed derived its being from 
<A NAME="491"></A>outside itself: this is no case of a self-originating substance being annihilated 
<A NAME="492"></A>by an external; it rose on the ruin of something else, and thus in its 
<A NAME="493"></A>own ruin it suffers nothing strange; and for every fire quenched, another 
<A NAME="494"></A>is kindled.
<A NAME="495"></A><BR><BR>In the immaterial heaven every member is unchangeably itself for 
<A NAME="496"></A>ever; in the heavens of our universe, while the whole has life eternally 
<A NAME="497"></A>and so too all the nobler and lordlier components, the Souls pass from 
<A NAME="498"></A>body to body entering into varied forms- and, when it may, a Soul will 
<A NAME="499"></A>rise outside of the realm of birth and dwell with the one Soul of all. 
<A NAME="500"></A>For the embodied lives by virtue of a Form or Idea: individual or partial 
<A NAME="501"></A>things exist by virtue of Universals; from these priors they derive their 
<A NAME="502"></A>life and maintenance, for life here is a thing of change; only in that 
<A NAME="503"></A>prior realm is it unmoving. From that unchangingness, change had to emerge, 
<A NAME="504"></A>and from that self-cloistered Life its derivative, this which breathes 
<A NAME="505"></A>and stirs, the respiration of the still life of the 
<A NAME="506"></A>divine.
<A NAME="507"></A><BR><BR>The conflict and destruction that reign among living beings are 
<A NAME="508"></A>inevitable, since things here are derived, brought into existence because 
<A NAME="509"></A>the Divine Reason which contains all of them in the upper Heavens- how 
<A NAME="510"></A>could they come here unless they were There?- must outflow over the whole 
<A NAME="511"></A>extent of Matter.
<A NAME="512"></A><BR><BR>Similarly, the very wronging of man by man may be derived from 
<A NAME="513"></A>an effort towards the Good; foiled, in their weakness, of their true desire, 
<A NAME="514"></A>they turn against each other: still, when they do wrong, they pay the penalty- 
<A NAME="515"></A>that of having hurt their Souls by their evil conduct and of degradation 
<A NAME="516"></A>to a lower place- for nothing can ever escape what stands decreed in the 
<A NAME="517"></A>law of the Universe.
<A NAME="518"></A><BR><BR>This is not to accept the idea, sometimes urged, that order is 
<A NAME="519"></A>an outcome of disorder and law of lawlessness, as if evil were a necessary 
<A NAME="520"></A>preliminary to their existence or their manifestation: on the contrary 
<A NAME="521"></A>order is the original and enters this sphere as imposed from without: it 
<A NAME="522"></A>is because order, law and reason exist that there can be disorder; breach 
<A NAME="523"></A>of law and unreason exist because Reason exists- not that these better 
<A NAME="524"></A>things are directly the causes of the bad but simply that what ought to 
<A NAME="525"></A>absorb the Best is prevented by its own nature, or by some accident, or 
<A NAME="526"></A>by foreign interference. An entity which must look outside itself for a 
<A NAME="527"></A>law, may be foiled of its purpose by either an internal or an external 
<A NAME="528"></A>cause; there will be some flaw in its own nature, or it will be hurt by 
<A NAME="529"></A>some alien influence, for often harm follows, unintended, upon the action 
<A NAME="530"></A>of others in the pursuit of quite unrelated aims. Such living beings, on 
<A NAME="531"></A>the other hand, as have freedom of motion under their own will sometimes 
<A NAME="532"></A>take the right turn, sometimes the wrong.
<A NAME="533"></A><BR><BR>Why the wrong course is followed is scarcely worth enquiring: a 
<A NAME="534"></A>slight deviation at the beginning develops with every advance into a continuously 
<A NAME="535"></A>wider and graver error- especially since there is the attached body with 
<A NAME="536"></A>its inevitable concomitant of desire- and the first step, the hasty movement 
<A NAME="537"></A>not previously considered and not immediately corrected, ends by establishing 
<A NAME="538"></A>a set habit where there was at first only a fall.
<A NAME="539"></A><BR><BR>Punishment naturally follows: there is no injustice in a man suffering 
<A NAME="540"></A>what belongs to the condition in which he is; nor can we ask to be happy 
<A NAME="541"></A>when our actions have not earned us happiness; the good, only, are happy; 
<A NAME="542"></A>divine beings are happy only because they are good.
<A NAME="543"></A><BR><BR><B>5.</B> Now, once Happiness is possible at all to Souls in this 
<A NAME="544"></A>Universe, if some fail of it, the blame must fall not upon the place but 
<A NAME="545"></A>upon the feebleness insufficient to the staunch combat in the one arena 
<A NAME="546"></A>where the rewards of excellence are offered. Men are not born divine; what 
<A NAME="547"></A>wonder that they do not enjoy a divine life. And poverty and sickness mean 
<A NAME="548"></A>nothing to the good- only to the evil are they disastrous- and where there 
<A NAME="549"></A>is body there must be ill health.
<A NAME="550"></A><BR><BR>Besides, these accidents are not without their service in the co-ordination 
<A NAME="551"></A>and completion of the Universal system.
<A NAME="552"></A><BR><BR>One thing perishes, and the Kosmic Reason- whose control nothing 
<A NAME="553"></A>anywhere eludes- employs that ending to the beginning of something new; 
<A NAME="554"></A>and, so, when the body suffers and the Soul, under the affliction, loses 
<A NAME="555"></A>power, all that has been bound under illness and evil is brought into a 
<A NAME="556"></A>new set of relations, into another class or order. Some of these troubles 
<A NAME="557"></A>are helpful to the very sufferers- poverty and sickness, for example- and 
<A NAME="558"></A>as for vice, even this brings something to the general service: it acts 
<A NAME="559"></A>as a lesson in right doing, and, in many ways even, produces good; thus, 
<A NAME="560"></A>by setting men face to face with the ways and consequences of iniquity, 
<A NAME="561"></A>it calls them from lethargy, stirs the deeper mind and sets the understanding 
<A NAME="562"></A>to work; by the contrast of the evil under which wrong-doers labour it 
<A NAME="563"></A>displays the worth of the right. Not that evil exists for this purpose; 
<A NAME="564"></A>but, as we have indicated, once the wrong has come to be, the Reason of 
<A NAME="565"></A>the Kosmos employs it to good ends; and, precisely, the proof of the mightiest 
<A NAME="566"></A>power is to be able to use the ignoble nobly and, given formlessness, to 
<A NAME="567"></A>make it the material of unknown forms.
<A NAME="568"></A><BR><BR>The principle is that evil by definition is a falling short in 
<A NAME="569"></A>good, and good cannot be at full strength in this Sphere where it is lodged 
<A NAME="570"></A>in the alien: the good here is in something else, in something distinct 
<A NAME="571"></A>from the Good, and this something else constitutes the falling short for 
<A NAME="572"></A>it is not good. And this is why evil is ineradicable: there is, first, 
<A NAME="573"></A>the fact that in relation to this principle of Good, thing will always 
<A NAME="574"></A>stand less than thing, and, besides, all things come into being through 
<A NAME="575"></A>it and are what they are by standing away from it.
<A NAME="576"></A><BR><BR><B>6.</B> As for the disregard of desert- the good afflicted, the 
<A NAME="577"></A>unworthy thriving- it is a sound explanation no doubt that to the good 
<A NAME="578"></A>nothing is evil and to the evil nothing can be good: still the question 
<A NAME="579"></A>remains why should what essentially offends our nature fall to the good 
<A NAME="580"></A>while the wicked enjoy all it demands? How can such an allotment be 
<A NAME="581"></A>approved?
<A NAME="582"></A><BR><BR>No doubt since pleasant conditions add nothing to true happiness 
<A NAME="583"></A>and the unpleasant do not lessen the evil in the wicked, the conditions 
<A NAME="584"></A>matter little: as well complain that a good man happens to be ugly and 
<A NAME="585"></A>a bad man handsome.
<A NAME="586"></A><BR><BR>Still, under such a dispensation, there would surely be a propriety, 
<A NAME="587"></A>a reasonableness, a regard to merit which, as things are, do not appear, 
<A NAME="588"></A>though this would certainly be in keeping with the noblest Providence: 
<A NAME="589"></A>even though external conditions do not affect a man's hold upon good or 
<A NAME="590"></A>evil, none the less it would seem utterly unfitting that the bad should 
<A NAME="591"></A>be the masters, be sovereign in the state, while honourable men are slaves: 
<A NAME="592"></A>a wicked ruler may commit the most lawless acts; and in war the worst men 
<A NAME="593"></A>have a free hand and perpetrate every kind of crime against their 
<A NAME="594"></A>prisoners.
<A NAME="595"></A><BR><BR>We are forced to ask how such things can be, under a Providence. 
<A NAME="596"></A>Certainly a maker must consider his work as a whole, but none the less 
<A NAME="597"></A>he should see to the due ordering of all the parts, especially when these 
<A NAME="598"></A>parts have Soul, that is, are Living and Reasoning Beings: the Providence 
<A NAME="599"></A>must reach to all the details; its functioning must consist in neglecting 
<A NAME="600"></A>no point.
<A NAME="601"></A><BR><BR>Holding, therefore, as we do, despite all, that the Universe lies 
<A NAME="602"></A>under an Intellectual Principle whose power has touched every existent, 
<A NAME="603"></A>we cannot be absolved from the attempt to show in what way the detail of 
<A NAME="604"></A>this sphere is just.
<A NAME="605"></A><BR><BR><B>7.</B> A preliminary observation: in looking for excellence 
<A NAME="606"></A>in this thing of mixture, the Kosmos, we cannot require all that is implied 
<A NAME="607"></A>in the excellence of the unmingled; it is folly to ask for Firsts in the 
<A NAME="608"></A>Secondary, and since this Universe contains body, we must allow for some 
<A NAME="609"></A>bodily influence upon the total and be thankful if the mingled existent 
<A NAME="610"></A>lack nothing of what its nature allowed it to receive from the Divine 
<A NAME="611"></A>Reason.
<A NAME="612"></A><BR><BR>Thus, supposing we were enquiring for the finest type of the human 
<A NAME="613"></A>being as known here, we would certainly not demand that he prove identical 
<A NAME="614"></A>with Man as in the Divine Intellect; we would think it enough in the Creator 
<A NAME="615"></A>to have so brought this thing of flesh and nerve and bone under Reason 
<A NAME="616"></A>as to give grace to these corporeal elements and to have made it possible 
<A NAME="617"></A>for Reason to have contact with Matter.
<A NAME="618"></A><BR><BR>Our progress towards the object of our investigation must begin 
<A NAME="619"></A>from this principle of gradation which will open to us the wonder of the 
<A NAME="620"></A>Providence and of the power by which our universe holds its 
<A NAME="621"></A>being.
<A NAME="622"></A><BR><BR>We begin with evil acts entirely dependent upon the Souls which 
<A NAME="623"></A>perpetrate them- the harm, for example, which perverted Souls do to the 
<A NAME="624"></A>good and to each other. Unless the foreplanning power alone is to be charged 
<A NAME="625"></A>with the vice in such Souls, we have no ground of accusation, no claim 
<A NAME="626"></A>to redress: the blame lies on the Soul exercising its choice. Even a Soul, 
<A NAME="627"></A>we have seen, must have its individual movement; it is not abstract Spirit; 
<A NAME="628"></A>the first step towards animal life has been taken and the conduct will 
<A NAME="629"></A>naturally be in keeping with that character.
<A NAME="630"></A><BR><BR>It is not because the world existed that Souls are here: before 
<A NAME="631"></A>the world was, they had it in them to be of the world, to concern themselves 
<A NAME="632"></A>with it, to presuppose it, to administer it: it was in their nature to 
<A NAME="633"></A>produce it- by whatever method, whether by giving forth some emanation 
<A NAME="634"></A>while they themselves remained above, or by an actual descent, or in both 
<A NAME="635"></A>ways together, some presiding from above, others descending; some for we 
<A NAME="636"></A>are not at the moment concerned about the mode of creation but are simply 
<A NAME="637"></A>urging that, however the world was produced, no blame falls on Providence 
<A NAME="638"></A>for what exists within it.
<A NAME="639"></A><BR><BR>There remains the other phase of the question- the distribution 
<A NAME="640"></A>of evil to the opposite classes of men: the good go bare while the wicked 
<A NAME="641"></A>are rich: all that human need demands, the least deserving have in abundance; 
<A NAME="642"></A>it is they that rule; peoples and states are at their disposal. Would not 
<A NAME="643"></A>all this imply that the divine power does not reach to 
<A NAME="644"></A>earth?
<A NAME="645"></A><BR><BR>That it does is sufficiently established by the fact that Reason 
<A NAME="646"></A>rules in the lower things: animals and plants have their share in Reason, 
<A NAME="647"></A>Soul and Life.
<A NAME="648"></A><BR><BR>Perhaps, then, it reaches to earth but is not master over 
<A NAME="649"></A>all?
<A NAME="650"></A><BR>We answer that the universe is one living organism: as well maintain 
<A NAME="651"></A>that while human head and face are the work of nature and of the ruling 
<A NAME="652"></A>reason-principle, the rest of the frame is due to other agencies- accident 
<A NAME="653"></A>or sheer necessity- and owes its inferiority to this origin, or to the 
<A NAME="654"></A>incompetence of unaided Nature. And even granting that those less noble 
<A NAME="655"></A>members are not in themselves admirable it would still be neither pious 
<A NAME="656"></A>nor even reverent to censure the entire structure.
<A NAME="657"></A><BR><BR><B>8.</B> Thus we come to our enquiry as to the degree of excellence 
<A NAME="658"></A>found in things of this Sphere, and how far they belong to an ordered system 
<A NAME="659"></A>or in what degree they are, at least, not evil.
<A NAME="660"></A><BR><BR>Now in every living being the upper parts- head, face- are the 
<A NAME="661"></A>most beautiful, the mid and lower members inferior. In the Universe the 
<A NAME="662"></A>middle and lower members are human beings; above them, the Heavens and 
<A NAME="663"></A>the Gods that dwell there; these Gods with the entire circling expanse 
<A NAME="664"></A>of the heavens constitute the greater part of the Kosmos: the earth is 
<A NAME="665"></A>but a central point, and may be considered as simply one among the stars. 
<A NAME="666"></A>Yet human wrong-doing is made a matter of wonder; we are evidently asked 
<A NAME="667"></A>to take humanity as the choice member of the Universe, nothing wiser 
<A NAME="668"></A>existent!
<A NAME="669"></A><BR><BR>But humanity, in reality, is poised midway between gods and beasts, 
<A NAME="670"></A>and inclines now to the one order, now to the other; some men grow like 
<A NAME="671"></A>to the divine, others to the brute, the greater number stand neutral. But 
<A NAME="672"></A>those that are corrupted to the point of approximating to irrational animals 
<A NAME="673"></A>and wild beasts pull the mid-folk about and inflict wrong upon them; the 
<A NAME="674"></A>victims are no doubt better than the wrongdoers, but are at the mercy of 
<A NAME="675"></A>their inferiors in the field in which they themselves are inferior, where, 
<A NAME="676"></A>that is, they cannot be classed among the good since they have not trained 
<A NAME="677"></A>themselves in self-defence.
<A NAME="678"></A><BR><BR>A gang of lads, morally neglected, and in that respect inferior 
<A NAME="679"></A>to the intermediate class, but in good physical training, attack and throw 
<A NAME="680"></A>another set, trained neither physically nor morally, and make off with 
<A NAME="681"></A>their food and their dainty clothes. What more is called for than a 
<A NAME="682"></A>laugh?
<A NAME="683"></A><BR><BR>And surely even the lawgiver would be right in allowing the second 
<A NAME="684"></A>group to suffer this treatment, the penalty of their sloth and self-indulgence: 
<A NAME="685"></A>the gymnasium lies there before them, and they, in laziness and luxury 
<A NAME="686"></A>and listlessness, have allowed themselves to fall like fat-loaded sheep, 
<A NAME="687"></A>a prey to the wolves.
<A NAME="688"></A><BR><BR>But the evil-doers also have their punishment: first they pay in 
<A NAME="689"></A>that very wolfishness, in the disaster to their human quality: and next 
<A NAME="690"></A>there is laid up for them the due of their Kind: living ill here, they 
<A NAME="691"></A>will not get off by death; on every precedent through all the line there 
<A NAME="692"></A>waits its sequent, reasonable and natural- worse to the bad, better to 
<A NAME="693"></A>the good.
<A NAME="694"></A><BR><BR>This at once brings us outside the gymnasium with its fun for boys; 
<A NAME="695"></A>they must grow up, both kinds, amid their childishness and both one day 
<A NAME="696"></A>stand girt and armed. Then there is a finer spectacle than is ever seen 
<A NAME="697"></A>by those that train in the ring. But at this stage some have not armed 
<A NAME="698"></A>themselves- and the duly armed win the day.
<A NAME="699"></A><BR><BR>Not even a God would have the right to deal a blow for the unwarlike: 
<A NAME="700"></A>the law decrees that to come safe out of battle is for fighting men, not 
<A NAME="701"></A>for those that pray. The harvest comes home not for praying but for tilling; 
<A NAME="702"></A>healthy days are not for those that neglect their health: we have no right 
<A NAME="703"></A>to complain of the ignoble getting the richer harvest if they are the only 
<A NAME="704"></A>workers in the fields, or the best.
<A NAME="705"></A><BR><BR>Again: it is childish, while we carry on all the affairs of our 
<A NAME="706"></A>life to our own taste and not as the Gods would have us, to expect them 
<A NAME="707"></A>to keep all well for us in spite of a life that is lived without regard 
<A NAME="708"></A>to the conditions which the Gods have prescribed for our well-being. Yet 
<A NAME="709"></A>death would be better for us than to go on living lives condemned by the 
<A NAME="710"></A>laws of the Universe. If things took the contrary course, if all the modes 
<A NAME="711"></A>of folly and wickedness brought no trouble in life- then indeed we might 
<A NAME="712"></A>complain of the indifference of a Providence leaving the victory to 
<A NAME="713"></A>evil.
<A NAME="714"></A><BR><BR>Bad men rule by the feebleness of the ruled: and this is just; 
<A NAME="715"></A>the triumph of weaklings would not be just.
<A NAME="716"></A><BR><BR><B>9.</B> It would not be just, because Providence cannot be a 
<A NAME="717"></A>something reducing us to nothingness: to think of Providence as everything, 
<A NAME="718"></A>with no other thing in existence, is to annihilate the Universe; such a 
<A NAME="719"></A>providence could have no field of action; nothing would exist except the 
<A NAME="720"></A>Divine. As things are, the Divine, of course, exists, but has reached forth 
<A NAME="721"></A>to something other- not to reduce that to nothingness but to preside over 
<A NAME="722"></A>it; thus in the case of Man, for instance, the Divine presides as the Providence, 
<A NAME="723"></A>preserving the character of human nature, that is the character of a being 
<A NAME="724"></A>under the providential law, which, again, implies subjection to what that 
<A NAME="725"></A>law may enjoin.
<A NAME="726"></A><BR><BR>And that law enjoins that those who have made themselves good shall 
<A NAME="727"></A>know the best of life, here and later, the bad the reverse. But the law 
<A NAME="728"></A>does not warrant the wicked in expecting that their prayers should bring 
<A NAME="729"></A>others to sacrifice themselves for their sakes; or that the gods should 
<A NAME="730"></A>lay aside the divine life in order to direct their daily concerns; or that 
<A NAME="731"></A>good men, who have chosen a path nobler than all earthly rule, should become 
<A NAME="732"></A>their rulers. The perverse have never made a single effort to bring the 
<A NAME="733"></A>good into authority, nor do they take any steps to improve themselves; 
<A NAME="734"></A>they are all spite against anyone that becomes good of his own motion, 
<A NAME="735"></A>though if good men were placed in authority the total of goodness would 
<A NAME="736"></A>be increased.
<A NAME="737"></A><BR><BR>In sum: Man has come into existence, a living being but not a member 
<A NAME="738"></A>of the noblest order; he occupies by choice an intermediate rank; still, 
<A NAME="739"></A>in that place in which he exists, Providence does not allow him to be reduced 
<A NAME="740"></A>to nothing; on the contrary he is ever being led upwards by all those varied 
<A NAME="741"></A>devices which the Divine employs in its labour to increase the dominance 
<A NAME="742"></A>of moral value. The human race, therefore, is not deprived by Providence 
<A NAME="743"></A>of its rational being; it retains its share, though necessarily limited, 
<A NAME="744"></A>in wisdom, intelligence, executive power and right doing, the right doing, 
<A NAME="745"></A>at least, of individuals to each other- and even in wronging others people 
<A NAME="746"></A>think they are doing right and only paying what is due.
<A NAME="747"></A><BR><BR>Man is, therefore, a noble creation, as perfect as the scheme allows; 
<A NAME="748"></A>a part, no doubt, in the fabric of the All, he yet holds a lot higher than 
<A NAME="749"></A>that of all the other living things of earth.
<A NAME="750"></A><BR><BR>Now, no one of any intelligence complains of these others, man's 
<A NAME="751"></A>inferiors, which serve to the adornment of the world; it would be feeble 
<A NAME="752"></A>indeed to complain of animals biting man, as if we were to pass our days 
<A NAME="753"></A>asleep. No: the animal, too, exists of necessity, and is serviceable in 
<A NAME="754"></A>many ways, some obvious and many progressively discovered- so that not 
<A NAME="755"></A>one lives without profit to itself and even to humanity. It is ridiculous, 
<A NAME="756"></A>also, to complain that many of them are dangerous- there are dangerous 
<A NAME="757"></A>men abroad as well- and if they distrust us, and in their distrust attack, 
<A NAME="758"></A>is that anything to wonder at?
<A NAME="759"></A><BR><BR><B>10.</B> But: if the evil in men is involuntary, if their own 
<A NAME="760"></A>will has not made them what they are, how can we either blame wrong-doers 
<A NAME="761"></A>or even reproach their victims with suffering through their own 
<A NAME="762"></A>fault?
<A NAME="763"></A><BR><BR>If there is a Necessity, bringing about human wickedness either 
<A NAME="764"></A>by force of the celestial movement or by a rigorous sequence set up by 
<A NAME="765"></A>the First Cause, is not the evil a thin rooted in Nature? And if thus the 
<A NAME="766"></A>Reason-Principle of the universe is the creator of evil, surely all is 
<A NAME="767"></A>injustice?
<A NAME="768"></A><BR><BR>No: Men are no doubt involuntary sinners in the sense that they 
<A NAME="769"></A>do not actually desire to sin; but this does not alter the fact that wrongdoers, 
<A NAME="770"></A>of their own choice, are, themselves, the agents; it is because they themselves 
<A NAME="771"></A>act that the sin is in their own; if they were not agents they could not 
<A NAME="772"></A>sin.
<A NAME="773"></A><BR><BR>The Necessity [held to underlie human wickedness] is not an outer 
<A NAME="774"></A>force [actually compelling the individual], but exists only in the sense 
<A NAME="775"></A>of a universal relationship.
<A NAME="776"></A><BR><BR>Nor is the force of the celestial Movement such as to leave us 
<A NAME="777"></A>powerless: if the universe were something outside and apart from us it 
<A NAME="778"></A>would stand as its makers willed so that, once the gods had done their 
<A NAME="779"></A>part, no man, however impious, could introduce anything contrary to their 
<A NAME="780"></A>intention. But, as things are, efficient act does come from men: given 
<A NAME="781"></A>the starting Principle, the secondary line, no doubt, is inevitably completed; 
<A NAME="782"></A>but each and every principle contributes towards the sequence. Now Men 
<A NAME="783"></A>are Principles, or, at least, they are moved by their characteristic nature 
<A NAME="784"></A>towards all that is good, and that nature is a Principle, a freely acting 
<A NAME="785"></A>cause.
<A NAME="786"></A><BR><BR><B>11.</B> Are we, then, to conclude that particular things are 
<A NAME="787"></A>determined by Necessities rooted in Nature and by the sequence of causes, 
<A NAME="788"></A>and that everything is as good as anything can be?
<A NAME="789"></A><BR><BR>No: the Reason-Principle is the sovereign, making all: it wills 
<A NAME="790"></A>things as they are and, in its reasonable act, it produces even what we 
<A NAME="791"></A>know as evil: it cannot desire all to be good: an artist would not make 
<A NAME="792"></A>an animal all eyes; and in the same way, the Reason-Principle would not 
<A NAME="793"></A>make all divine; it makes Gods but also celestial spirits, the intermediate 
<A NAME="794"></A>order, then men, then the animals; all is graded succession, and this in 
<A NAME="795"></A>no spirit of grudging but in the expression of a Reason teeming with intellectual 
<A NAME="796"></A>variety.
<A NAME="797"></A><BR><BR>We are like people ignorant of painting who complain that the colours 
<A NAME="798"></A>are not beautiful everywhere in the picture: but the Artist has laid on 
<A NAME="799"></A>the appropriate tint to every spot. Or we are censuring a drama because 
<A NAME="800"></A>the persons are not all heroes but include a servant and a rustic and some 
<A NAME="801"></A>scurrilous clown; yet take away the low characters and the power of the 
<A NAME="802"></A>drama is gone; these are part and parcel of it.
<A NAME="803"></A><BR><BR><B>12.</B> Suppose this Universe were the direct creation of the 
<A NAME="804"></A>Reason-Principle applying itself, quite unchanged, to Matter, retaining, 
<A NAME="805"></A>that is, the hostility to partition which it derives from its Prior, the 
<A NAME="806"></A>Intellectual Principle- then, this its product, so produced, would be of 
<A NAME="807"></A>supreme and unparalleled excellence. But the Reason-Principle could not 
<A NAME="808"></A>be a thing of entire identity or even of closely compact diversity; and 
<A NAME="809"></A>the mode in which it is here manifested is no matter of censure since its 
<A NAME="810"></A>function is to be all things, each single thing in some distinctive 
<A NAME="811"></A>way.
<A NAME="812"></A><BR><BR>But has it not, besides itself entering Matter, brought other beings 
<A NAME="813"></A>down? Has it not for example brought Souls into Matter and, in adapting 
<A NAME="814"></A>them to its creation, twisted them against their own nature and been the 
<A NAME="815"></A>ruin of many of them? And can this be right?
<A NAME="816"></A><BR><BR>The answer is that the Souls are, in a fair sense, members of this 
<A NAME="817"></A>Reason-Principle and that it has not adapted them to the creation by perverting 
<A NAME="818"></A>them, but has set them in the place here to which their quality entitles 
<A NAME="819"></A>them.
<A NAME="820"></A><BR><BR><B>13.</B> And we must not despise the familiar observation that 
<A NAME="821"></A>there is something more to be considered than the present. There are the 
<A NAME="822"></A>periods of the past and, again, those in the future; and these have everything 
<A NAME="823"></A>to do with fixing worth of place.
<A NAME="824"></A><BR><BR>Thus a man, once a ruler, will be made a slave because he abused 
<A NAME="825"></A>his power and because the fall is to his future good. Those that have money 
<A NAME="826"></A>will be made poor- and to the good poverty is no hindrance. Those that 
<A NAME="827"></A>have unjustly killed, are killed in turn, unjustly as regards the murderer 
<A NAME="828"></A>but justly as regards the victim, and those that are to suffer are thrown 
<A NAME="829"></A>into the path of those that administer the merited treatment.
<A NAME="830"></A><BR><BR>It is not an accident that makes a man a slave; no one is a prisoner 
<A NAME="831"></A>by chance; every bodily outrage has its due cause. The man once did what 
<A NAME="832"></A>he now suffers. A man that murders his mother will become a woman and be 
<A NAME="833"></A>murdered by a son; a man that wrongs a woman will become a woman, to be 
<A NAME="834"></A>wronged.
<A NAME="835"></A><BR><BR>Hence arises that awesome word "Adrasteia" [the Inevadable Retribution]; 
<A NAME="836"></A>for in very truth this ordinance is an Adrasteia, justice itself and a 
<A NAME="837"></A>wonderful wisdom.
<A NAME="838"></A><BR><BR>We cannot but recognize from what we observe in this universe that 
<A NAME="839"></A>some such principle of order prevails throughout the entire of existence- 
<A NAME="840"></A>the minutest of things a tributary to the vast total; the marvellous art 
<A NAME="841"></A>shown not merely in the mightiest works and sublimest members of the All, 
<A NAME="842"></A>but even amid such littleness as one would think Providence must disdain: 
<A NAME="843"></A>the varied workmanship of wonder in any and every animal form; the world 
<A NAME="844"></A>of vegetation, too; the grace of fruits and even of leaves, the lavishness, 
<A NAME="845"></A>the delicacy, the diversity of exquisite bloom; and all this not issuing 
<A NAME="846"></A>once, and then to die out, but made ever and ever anew as the Transcendent 
<A NAME="847"></A>Beings move variously over this earth.
<A NAME="848"></A><BR><BR>In all the changing, there is no change by chance: there is no 
<A NAME="849"></A>taking of new forms but to desirable ends and in ways worthy of Divine 
<A NAME="850"></A>Powers. All that is Divine executes the Act of its quality; its quality 
<A NAME="851"></A>is the expression of its essential Being: and this essential Being in the 
<A NAME="852"></A>Divine is the Being whose activities produce as one thing the desirable 
<A NAME="853"></A>and the just- for if the good and the just are not produced there, where, 
<A NAME="854"></A>then, have they their being?
<A NAME="855"></A><BR><BR><B>14.</B> The ordinance of the Kosmos, then, is in keeping with 
<A NAME="856"></A>the Intellectual Principle. True, no reasoning went to its creation, but 
<A NAME="857"></A>it so stands that the keenest reasoning must wonder- since no reasoning 
<A NAME="858"></A>could be able to make it otherwise- at the spectacle before it, a product 
<A NAME="859"></A>which, even in the Kinds of the partial and particular Sphere, displays 
<A NAME="860"></A>the Divine Intelligence to a degree in which no arranging by reason could 
<A NAME="861"></A>express it. Every one of the ceaselessly recurrent types of being manifests 
<A NAME="862"></A>a creating Reason-Principle above all censure. No fault is to be found 
<A NAME="863"></A>unless on the assumption that everything ought to come into being with 
<A NAME="864"></A>all the perfection of those that have never known such a coming, the Eternals. 
<A NAME="865"></A>In that case, things of the Intellectual realm and things of the realm 
<A NAME="866"></A>of sense must remain one unbroken identity for ever.
<A NAME="867"></A><BR><BR>In this demand for more good than exists, there is implied a failure 
<A NAME="868"></A>to recognize that the form allotted to each entity is sufficient in itself; 
<A NAME="869"></A>it is like complaining because one kind of animal lacks horns. We ought 
<A NAME="870"></A>to understand both that the Reason-Principle must extend to every possible 
<A NAME="871"></A>existent and, at the same time, that every greater must include lesser 
<A NAME="872"></A>things, that to every whole belong its parts, and that all cannot be equality 
<A NAME="873"></A>unless all part is to be absent.
<A NAME="874"></A><BR><BR>This is why in the Over-World each entity is all, while here, below, 
<A NAME="875"></A>the single thing is not all [is not the Universe but a "Self"]. Thus too, 
<A NAME="876"></A>a man, an individual, in so far as he is a part, is not Humanity complete: 
<A NAME="877"></A>but wheresoever there is associated with the parts something that is no 
<A NAME="878"></A>part [but a Divine, an Intellectual Being], this makes a whole of that 
<A NAME="879"></A>in which it dwells. Man, man as partial thing, cannot be required to have 
<A NAME="880"></A>attained to the very summit of goodness: if he had, he would have ceased 
<A NAME="881"></A>to be of the partial order. Not that there is any grudging in the whole 
<A NAME="882"></A>towards the part that grows in goodness and dignity; such an increase in 
<A NAME="883"></A>value is a gain to the beauty of the whole; the lesser grows by being made 
<A NAME="884"></A>over in the likeness of the greater, by being admitted, as it were, to 
<A NAME="885"></A>something of that greatness, by sharing in that rank, and thus even from 
<A NAME="886"></A>this place of man, from man's own self, something gleams forth, as the 
<A NAME="887"></A>stars shine in the divine firmament, so that all appears one great and 
<A NAME="888"></A>lovely figure- living or wrought in the furnaces of craftsmanship- with 
<A NAME="889"></A>stars radiant not only in the ears and on the brow but on the breasts too, 
<A NAME="890"></A>and wherever else they may be displayed in beauty.
<A NAME="891"></A><BR><BR><B>15.</B> These considerations apply very well to things considered 
<A NAME="892"></A>as standing alone: but there is a stumbling-block, a new problem, when 
<A NAME="893"></A>we think of all these forms, permanent and ceaselessly produced, in mutual 
<A NAME="894"></A>relationship.
<A NAME="895"></A><BR><BR>The animals devour each other: men attack each other: all is war 
<A NAME="896"></A>without rest, without truce: this gives new force to the question how Reason 
<A NAME="897"></A>can be author of the plan and how all can be declared well 
<A NAME="898"></A>done.
<A NAME="899"></A><BR><BR>This new difficulty is not met by the former answer; that all stands 
<A NAME="900"></A>as well as the nature of things allows; that the blame for their condition 
<A NAME="901"></A>falls on Matter dragging them down; that, given the plan as we know it, 
<A NAME="902"></A>evil cannot be eliminated and should not be; that the Matter making its 
<A NAME="903"></A>presence felt is still not supreme but remains an element taken in from 
<A NAME="904"></A>outside to contribute to a definite total, or rather to be itself brought 
<A NAME="905"></A>to order by Reason.
<A NAME="906"></A><BR><BR>The Divine Reason is the beginning and the end; all that comes 
<A NAME="907"></A>into being must be rational and fall at its coming into an ordered scheme 
<A NAME="908"></A>reasonable at every point. Where, then, is the necessity of this bandit 
<A NAME="909"></A>war of man and beast?
<A NAME="910"></A><BR><BR>This devouring of Kind by Kind is necessary as the means to the 
<A NAME="911"></A>transmutation of living things which could not keep form for ever even 
<A NAME="912"></A>though no other killed them: what grievance is it that when they must go 
<A NAME="913"></A>their despatch is so planned as to be serviceable to 
<A NAME="914"></A>others?
<A NAME="915"></A><BR><BR>Still more, what does it matter when they are devoured only to 
<A NAME="916"></A>return in some new form? It comes to no more than the murder of one of 
<A NAME="917"></A>the personages in a play; the actor alters his make-up and enters in a 
<A NAME="918"></A>new role. The actor, of course, was not really killed; but if dying is 
<A NAME="919"></A>but changing a body as the actor changes a costume, or even an exit from 
<A NAME="920"></A>the body like the exit of the actor from the boards when he has no more 
<A NAME="921"></A>to say or do, what is there so very dreadful in this transformation of 
<A NAME="922"></A>living beings one into another?
<A NAME="923"></A><BR><BR>Surely it is much better so than if they had never existed: that 
<A NAME="924"></A>way would mean the bleak quenching of life, precluded from passing outside 
<A NAME="925"></A>itself; as the plan holds, life is poured copiously throughout a Universe, 
<A NAME="926"></A>engendering the universal things and weaving variety into their being, 
<A NAME="927"></A>never at rest from producing an endless sequence of comeliness and shapeliness, 
<A NAME="928"></A>a living pastime.
<A NAME="929"></A><BR><BR>Men directing their weapons against each other- under doom of death 
<A NAME="930"></A>yet neatly lined up to fight as in the pyrrhic sword-dances of their sport- 
<A NAME="931"></A>this is enough to tell us that all human intentions are but play, that 
<A NAME="932"></A>death is nothing terrible, that to die in a war or in a fight is but to 
<A NAME="933"></A>taste a little beforehand what old age has in store, to go away earlier 
<A NAME="934"></A>and come back the sooner. So for misfortunes that may accompany life, the 
<A NAME="935"></A>loss of property, for instance; the loser will see that there was a time 
<A NAME="936"></A>when it was not his, that its possession is but a mock boon to the robbers, 
<A NAME="937"></A>who will in their turn lose it to others, and even that to retain property 
<A NAME="938"></A>is a greater loss than to forfeit it.
<A NAME="939"></A><BR><BR>Murders, death in all its guises, the reduction and sacking of 
<A NAME="940"></A>cities, all must be to us just such a spectacle as the changing scenes 
<A NAME="941"></A>of a play; all is but the varied incident of a plot, costume on and off, 
<A NAME="942"></A>acted grief and lament. For on earth, in all the succession of life, it 
<A NAME="943"></A>is not the Soul within but the Shadow outside of the authentic man, that 
<A NAME="944"></A>grieves and complains and acts out the plot on this world stage which men 
<A NAME="945"></A>have dotted with stages of their own constructing. All this is the doing 
<A NAME="946"></A>of man knowing no more than to live the lower and outer life, and never 
<A NAME="947"></A>perceiving that, in his weeping and in his graver doings alike, he is but 
<A NAME="948"></A>at play; to handle austere matters austerely is reserved for the thoughtful: 
<A NAME="949"></A>the other kind of man is himself a futility. Those incapable of thinking 
<A NAME="950"></A>gravely read gravity into frivolities which correspond to their own frivolous 
<A NAME="951"></A>Nature. Anyone that joins in their trifling and so comes to look on life 
<A NAME="952"></A>with their eyes must understand that by lending himself to such idleness 
<A NAME="953"></A>he has laid aside his own character. If Socrates himself takes part in 
<A NAME="954"></A>the trifling, he trifles in the outer Socrates.
<A NAME="955"></A><BR><BR>We must remember, too, that we cannot take tears and laments as 
<A NAME="956"></A>proof that anything is wrong; children cry and whimper where there is nothing 
<A NAME="957"></A>amiss.
<A NAME="958"></A><BR><BR><B>16.</B> But if all this is true, what room is left for evil? 
<A NAME="959"></A>Where are we to place wrong-doing and sin?
<A NAME="960"></A><BR><BR>How explain that in a world organized in good, the efficient agents 
<A NAME="961"></A>[human beings] behave unjustly, commit sin? And how comes misery if neither 
<A NAME="962"></A>sin nor injustice exists?
<A NAME="963"></A><BR><BR>Again, if all our action is determined by a natural process, how 
<A NAME="964"></A>can the distinction be maintained between behaviour in accordance with 
<A NAME="965"></A>nature and behaviour in conflict with it?
<A NAME="966"></A><BR><BR>And what becomes of blasphemy against the divine? The blasphemer 
<A NAME="967"></A>is made what he is: a dramatist has written a part insulting and maligning 
<A NAME="968"></A>himself and given it to an actor to play.
<A NAME="969"></A><BR><BR>These considerations oblige us to state the Logos [the Reason-Principle 
<A NAME="970"></A>of the Universe] once again, and more clearly, and to justify its 
<A NAME="971"></A>nature.
<A NAME="972"></A><BR><BR>This Reason-Principle, then- let us dare the definition in the 
<A NAME="973"></A>hope of conveying the truth- this Logos is not the Intellectual Principle 
<A NAME="974"></A>unmingled, not the Absolute Divine Intellect; nor does it descend from 
<A NAME="975"></A>the pure Soul alone; it is a dependent of that Soul while, in a sense, 
<A NAME="976"></A>it is a radiation from both those divine Hypostases; the Intellectual Principle 
<A NAME="977"></A>and the Soul- the Soul as conditioned by the Intellectual Principle engender 
<A NAME="978"></A>this Logos which is a Life holding restfully a certain measure of 
<A NAME="979"></A>Reason.
<A NAME="980"></A><BR><BR>Now all life, even the least valuable, is an activity, and not 
<A NAME="981"></A>a blind activity like that of flame; even where there is not sensation 
<A NAME="982"></A>the activity of life is no mere haphazard play of Movement: any object 
<A NAME="983"></A>in which life is present, and object which participates in Life, is at 
<A NAME="984"></A>once enreasoned in the sense that the activity peculiar to life is formative, 
<A NAME="985"></A>shaping as it moves.
<A NAME="986"></A><BR><BR>Life, then, aims at pattern as does the pantomimic dancer with 
<A NAME="987"></A>his set movements; the mime, in himself, represents life, and, besides, 
<A NAME="988"></A>his movements proceed in obedience to a pattern designed to symbolize 
<A NAME="989"></A>life.
<A NAME="990"></A><BR><BR>Thus far to give us some idea of the nature of Life in 
<A NAME="991"></A>general.
<A NAME="992"></A><BR>But this Reason-Principle which emanates from the complete unity, divine 
<A NAME="993"></A>Mind, and the complete unity Life [= Soul]- is neither a uniate complete 
<A NAME="994"></A>Life nor a uniate complete divine Mind, nor does it give itself whole and 
<A NAME="995"></A>all-including to its subject. [By an imperfect communication] it sets up 
<A NAME="996"></A>a conflict of part against part: it produces imperfect things and so engenders 
<A NAME="997"></A>and maintains war and attack, and thus its unity can be that only of a 
<A NAME="998"></A>sum-total not of a thing undivided. At war with itself in the parts which 
<A NAME="999"></A>it now exhibits, it has the unity, or harmony, of a drama torn with struggle. 
<A NAME="1000"></A>The drama, of course, brings the conflicting elements to one final harmony, 
<A NAME="1001"></A>weaving the entire story of the clashing characters into one thing; while 
<A NAME="1002"></A>in the Logos the conflict of the divergent elements rises within the one 
<A NAME="1003"></A>element, the Reason-Principle: the comparison therefore is rather with 
<A NAME="1004"></A>a harmony emerging directly from the conflicting elements themselves, and 
<A NAME="1005"></A>the question becomes what introduces clashing elements among these 
<A NAME="1006"></A>Reason-Principles.
<A NAME="1007"></A><BR><BR>Now in the case of music, tones high and low are the product of 
<A NAME="1008"></A>Reason-Principles which, by the fact that they are Principles of harmony, 
<A NAME="1009"></A>meet in the unit of Harmony, the absolute Harmony, a more comprehensive 
<A NAME="1010"></A>Principle, greater than they and including them as its parts. Similarly 
<A NAME="1011"></A>in the Universe at large we find contraries- white and black, hot and cold, 
<A NAME="1012"></A>winged and wingless, footed and footless, reasoning and unreasoning- but 
<A NAME="1013"></A>all these elements are members of one living body, their sum-total; the 
<A NAME="1014"></A>Universe is a self-accordant entity, its members everywhere clashing but 
<A NAME="1015"></A>the total being the manifestation of a Reason-Principle. That one Reason-Principle, 
<A NAME="1016"></A>then, must be the unification of conflicting Reason-Principles whose very 
<A NAME="1017"></A>opposition is the support of its coherence and, almost, of its 
<A NAME="1018"></A>Being.
<A NAME="1019"></A><BR><BR>And indeed, if it were not multiple, it could not be a Universal 
<A NAME="1020"></A>Principle, it could not even be at all a Reason-Principle; in the fact 
<A NAME="1021"></A>of its being a Reason-Principle is contained the fact of interior difference. 
<A NAME="1022"></A>Now the maximum of difference is contrariety; admitting that this differentiation 
<A NAME="1023"></A>exists and creates, it will create difference in the greatest and not in 
<A NAME="1024"></A>the least degree; in other words, the Reason-Principle, bringing about 
<A NAME="1025"></A>differentiation to the uttermost degree, will of necessity create contrarieties: 
<A NAME="1026"></A>it will be complete only by producing itself not in merely diverse things 
<A NAME="1027"></A>but in contrary things.
<A NAME="1028"></A><BR><BR><B>17.</B> The nature of the Reason-Principle is adequately expressed 
<A NAME="1029"></A>in its Act and, therefore, the wider its extension the nearer will its 
<A NAME="1030"></A>productions approach to full contrariety: hence the world of sense is less 
<A NAME="1031"></A>a unity than is its Reason-Principle; it contains a wider multiplicity 
<A NAME="1032"></A>and contrariety: its partial members will, therefore, be urged by a closer 
<A NAME="1033"></A>intention towards fullness of life, a warmer desire for 
<A NAME="1034"></A>unification.
<A NAME="1035"></A><BR><BR>But desire often destroys the desired; it seeks its own good, and, 
<A NAME="1036"></A>if the desired object is perishable, the ruin follows: and the partial 
<A NAME="1037"></A>thing straining towards its completing principle draws towards itself all 
<A NAME="1038"></A>it possibly can.
<A NAME="1039"></A><BR><BR>Thus, with the good we have the bad: we have the opposed movements 
<A NAME="1040"></A>of a dancer guided by one artistic plan; we recognize in his steps the 
<A NAME="1041"></A>good as against the bad, and see that in the opposition lies the merit 
<A NAME="1042"></A>of the design.
<A NAME="1043"></A><BR><BR>But, thus, the wicked disappear?
<A NAME="1044"></A><BR>No: their wickedness remains; simply, their role is not of their own 
<A NAME="1045"></A>planning.
<A NAME="1046"></A><BR><BR>But, surely, this excuses them?
<A NAME="1047"></A><BR>No; excuse lies with the Reason-Principle- and the Reason-Principle 
<A NAME="1048"></A>does not excuse them.
<A NAME="1049"></A><BR><BR>No doubt all are members of this Principle but one is a good man, 
<A NAME="1050"></A>another is bad- the larger class, this- and it goes as in a play; the poet 
<A NAME="1051"></A>while he gives each actor a part is also using them as they are in their 
<A NAME="1052"></A>own persons: he does not himself rank the men as leading actor, second, 
<A NAME="1053"></A>third; he simply gives suitable words to each, and by that assignment fixes 
<A NAME="1054"></A>each man's standing.
<A NAME="1055"></A><BR><BR>Thus, every man has his place, a place that fits the good man, 
<A NAME="1056"></A>a place that fits the bad: each within the two orders of them makes his 
<A NAME="1057"></A>way, naturally, reasonably, to the place, good or bad, that suits him, 
<A NAME="1058"></A>and takes the position he has made his own. There he talks and acts, in 
<A NAME="1059"></A>blasphemy and crime or in all goodness: for the actors bring to this play 
<A NAME="1060"></A>what they were before it was ever staged.
<A NAME="1061"></A><BR><BR>In the dramas of human art, the poet provides the words but the 
<A NAME="1062"></A>actors add their own quality, good or bad- for they have more to do than 
<A NAME="1063"></A>merely repeat the author's words- in the truer drama which dramatic genius 
<A NAME="1064"></A>imitates in its degree, the Soul displays itself in a part assigned by 
<A NAME="1065"></A>the creator of the piece.
<A NAME="1066"></A><BR><BR>As the actors of our stages get their masks and their costume, 
<A NAME="1067"></A>robes of state or rags, so a Soul is allotted its fortunes, and not at 
<A NAME="1068"></A>haphazard but always under a Reason: it adapts itself to the fortunes assigned 
<A NAME="1069"></A>to it, attunes itself, ranges itself rightly to the drama, to the whole 
<A NAME="1070"></A>Principle of the piece: then it speaks out its business, exhibiting at 
<A NAME="1071"></A>the same time all that a Soul can express of its own quality, as a singer 
<A NAME="1072"></A>in a song. A voice, a bearing, naturally fine or vulgar, may increase the 
<A NAME="1073"></A>charm of a piece; on the other hand, an actor with his ugly voice may make 
<A NAME="1074"></A>a sorry exhibition of himself, yet the drama stands as good a work as ever: 
<A NAME="1075"></A>the dramatist, taking the action which a sound criticism suggests, disgraces 
<A NAME="1076"></A>one, taking his part from him, with perfect justice: another man he promotes 
<A NAME="1077"></A>to more serious roles or to any more important play he may have, while 
<A NAME="1078"></A>the first is cast for whatever minor work there may 
<A NAME="1079"></A>be.
<A NAME="1080"></A><BR><BR>Just so the Soul, entering this drama of the Universe, making itself 
<A NAME="1081"></A>a part of the Play, bringing to its acting its personal excellence or defect, 
<A NAME="1082"></A>set in a definite place at the entry and accepting from the author its 
<A NAME="1083"></A>entire role- superimposed upon its own character and conduct- just so, 
<A NAME="1084"></A>it receives in the end its punishment and reward.
<A NAME="1085"></A><BR><BR>But these actors, Souls, hold a peculiar dignity: they act in a 
<A NAME="1086"></A>vaster place than any stage: the Author has made them masters of all this 
<A NAME="1087"></A>world; they have a wide choice of place; they themselves determine the 
<A NAME="1088"></A>honour or discredit in which they are agents since their place and part 
<A NAME="1089"></A>are in keeping with their quality: they therefore fit into the Reason-Principle 
<A NAME="1090"></A>of the Universe, each adjusted, most legitimately, to the appropriate environment, 
<A NAME="1091"></A>as every string of the lyre is set in the precisely right position, determined 
<A NAME="1092"></A>by the Principle directing musical utterance, for the due production of 
<A NAME="1093"></A>the tones within its capacity. All is just and good in the Universe in 
<A NAME="1094"></A>which every actor is set in his own quite appropriate place, though it 
<A NAME="1095"></A>be to utter in the Darkness and in Tartarus the dreadful sounds whose utterance 
<A NAME="1096"></A>there is well.
<A NAME="1097"></A><BR><BR>This Universe is good not when the individual is a stone, but when 
<A NAME="1098"></A>everyone throws in his own voice towards a total harmony, singing out a 
<A NAME="1099"></A>life- thin, harsh, imperfect, though it be. The Syrinx does not utter merely 
<A NAME="1100"></A>one pure note; there is a thin obscure sound which blends in to make the 
<A NAME="1101"></A>harmony of Syrinx music: the harmony is made up from tones of various grades, 
<A NAME="1102"></A>all the tones differing, but the resultant of all forming one 
<A NAME="1103"></A>sound.
<A NAME="1104"></A><BR><BR>Similarly the Reason-Principle entire is One, but it is broken 
<A NAME="1105"></A>into unequal parts: hence the difference of place found in the Universe, 
<A NAME="1106"></A>better spots and worse; and hence the inequality of Souls, finding their 
<A NAME="1107"></A>appropriate surroundings amid this local inequality. The diverse places 
<A NAME="1108"></A>of this sphere, the Souls of unequal grade and unlike conduct, are wen 
<A NAME="1109"></A>exemplified by the distinction of parts in the Syrinx or any other instrument: 
<A NAME="1110"></A>there is local difference, but from every position every string gives forth 
<A NAME="1111"></A>its own tone, the sound appropriate, at once, to its particular place and 
<A NAME="1112"></A>to the entire plan.
<A NAME="1113"></A><BR><BR>What is evil in the single Soul will stand a good thing in the 
<A NAME="1114"></A>universal system; what in the unit offends nature will serve nature in 
<A NAME="1115"></A>the total event- and still remains the weak and wrong tone it is, though 
<A NAME="1116"></A>its sounding takes nothing from the worth of the whole, just as, in another 
<A NAME="1117"></A>order of image, the executioner's ugly office does not mar the well-governed 
<A NAME="1118"></A>state: such an officer is a civic necessity; and the corresponding moral 
<A NAME="1119"></A>type is often serviceable; thus, even as things are, all is 
<A NAME="1120"></A>well.
<A NAME="1121"></A><BR><BR><B>18.</B> Souls vary in worth; and the difference is due, among 
<A NAME="1122"></A>other causes, to an almost initial inequality; it is in reason that, standing 
<A NAME="1123"></A>to the Reason-Principle, as parts, they should be unequal by the fact of 
<A NAME="1124"></A>becoming separate.
<A NAME="1125"></A><BR><BR>We must also remember that every Soul has its second grade and 
<A NAME="1126"></A>its third, and that, therefore, its expression may take any one of three 
<A NAME="1127"></A>main forms. But this point must be dealt with here again: the matter requires 
<A NAME="1128"></A>all possible elucidation.
<A NAME="1129"></A><BR><BR>We may perhaps think of actors having the right to add something 
<A NAME="1130"></A>to the poet's words: the drama as it stands is not perfectly filled in, 
<A NAME="1131"></A>and they are to supply where the Author has left blank spaces here and 
<A NAME="1132"></A>there; the actors are to be something else as well; they become parts of 
<A NAME="1133"></A>the poet, who on his side has a foreknowledge of the word they will add, 
<A NAME="1134"></A>and so is able to bind into one story what the actors bring in and what 
<A NAME="1135"></A>is to follow.
<A NAME="1136"></A><BR><BR>For, in the All, the sequences, including what follows upon wickedness, 
<A NAME="1137"></A>become Reason-Principles, and therefore in right reason. Thus: from adultery 
<A NAME="1138"></A>and the violation of prisoners the process of nature will produce fine 
<A NAME="1139"></A>children, to grow, perhaps, into fine men; and where wicked violence has 
<A NAME="1140"></A>destroyed cities, other and nobler cities may rise in their 
<A NAME="1141"></A>place.
<A NAME="1142"></A><BR><BR>But does not this make it absurd to introduce Souls as responsible 
<A NAME="1143"></A>causes, some acting for good and some for evil? If we thus exonerate the 
<A NAME="1144"></A>Reason-Principle from any part in wickedness do we not also cancel its
