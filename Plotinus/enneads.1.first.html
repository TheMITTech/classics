<A NAME="10"></A><B>First Tractate</B>
<A NAME="11"></A><BR><BR><B>THE ANIMATE AND THE MAN.</B>
<A NAME="12"></A><BR><BR><B>1.</B> Pleasure and distress, fear and courage, desire and aversion, 
<A NAME="13"></A>where have these affections and experiences their seat?
<A NAME="14"></A><BR><BR>Clearly, either in the Soul alone, or in the Soul as employing 
<A NAME="15"></A>the body, or in some third entity deriving from both. And for this third 
<A NAME="16"></A>entity, again, there are two possible modes: it might be either a blend 
<A NAME="17"></A>or a distinct form due to the blending.
<A NAME="18"></A><BR><BR>And what applies to the affections applies also to whatsoever acts, 
<A NAME="19"></A>physical or mental, spring from them.
<A NAME="20"></A><BR><BR>We have, therefore, to examine discursive-reason and the ordinary 
<A NAME="21"></A>mental action upon objects of sense, and enquire whether these have the 
<A NAME="22"></A>one seat with the affections and experiences, or perhaps sometimes the 
<A NAME="23"></A>one seat, sometimes another.
<A NAME="24"></A><BR><BR>And we must consider also our acts of Intellection, their mode 
<A NAME="25"></A>and their seat.
<A NAME="26"></A><BR><BR>And this very examining principle, which investigates and decides 
<A NAME="27"></A>in these matters, must be brought to light.
<A NAME="28"></A><BR><BR>Firstly, what is the seat of Sense-Perception? This is the obvious 
<A NAME="29"></A>beginning since the affections and experiences either are sensations of 
<A NAME="30"></A>some kind or at least never occur apart from sensation.
<A NAME="31"></A><BR><BR><B>2.</B> This first enquiry obliges us to consider at the outset 
<A NAME="32"></A>the nature of the Soul- that is whether a distinction is to be made between 
<A NAME="33"></A>Soul and Essential Soul [between an individual Soul and the Soul-Kind in 
<A NAME="34"></A>itself]. *
<A NAME="35"></A><BR><BR>* All matter shown in brackets is added by the translator for clearness' 
<A NAME="36"></A>sake and, therefore, is not canonical. S.M.
<A NAME="37"></A><BR><BR>If such a distinction holds, then the Soul [in man] is some sort 
<A NAME="38"></A>of a composite and at once we may agree that it is a recipient and- if 
<A NAME="39"></A>only reason allows- that all the affections and experiences really have 
<A NAME="40"></A>their seat in the Soul, and with the affections every state and mood, good 
<A NAME="41"></A>and bad alike.
<A NAME="42"></A><BR><BR>But if Soul [in man] and Essential Soul are one and the same, then 
<A NAME="43"></A>the Soul will be an Ideal-Form unreceptive of all those activities which 
<A NAME="44"></A>it imparts to another Kind but possessing within itself that native Act 
<A NAME="45"></A>of its own which Reason manifests.
<A NAME="46"></A><BR><BR>If this be so, then, indeed, we may think of the Soul as an immortal- 
<A NAME="47"></A>if the immortal, the imperishable, must be impassive, giving out something 
<A NAME="48"></A>of itself but itself taking nothing from without except for what it receives 
<A NAME="49"></A>from the Existents prior to itself from which Existents, in that they are 
<A NAME="50"></A>the nobler, it cannot be sundered.
<A NAME="51"></A><BR><BR>Now what could bring fear to a nature thus unreceptive of all the 
<A NAME="52"></A>outer? Fear demands feeling. Nor is there place for courage: courage implies 
<A NAME="53"></A>the presence of danger. And such desires as are satisfied by the filling 
<A NAME="54"></A>or voiding of the body, must be proper to something very different from 
<A NAME="55"></A>the Soul, to that only which admits of replenishment and 
<A NAME="56"></A>voidance.
<A NAME="57"></A><BR><BR>And how could the Soul lend itself to any admixture? An essential 
<A NAME="58"></A>is not mixed. Or of the intrusion of anything alien? If it did, it would 
<A NAME="59"></A>be seeking the destruction of its own nature. Pain must be equally far 
<A NAME="60"></A>from it. And Grief- how or for what could it grieve? Whatever possesses 
<A NAME="61"></A>Existence is supremely free, dwelling, unchangeable, within its own peculiar 
<A NAME="62"></A>nature. And can any increase bring joy, where nothing, not even anything 
<A NAME="63"></A>good, can accrue? What such an Existent is, it is unchangeably.
<A NAME="64"></A><BR><BR>Thus assuredly Sense-Perception, Discursive-Reasoning; and all 
<A NAME="65"></A>our ordinary mentation are foreign to the Soul: for sensation is a receiving- 
<A NAME="66"></A>whether of an Ideal-Form or of an impassive body- and reasoning and all 
<A NAME="67"></A>ordinary mental action deal with sensation.
<A NAME="68"></A><BR><BR>The question still remains to be examined in the matter of the 
<A NAME="69"></A>intellections- whether these are to be assigned to the Soul- and as to 
<A NAME="70"></A>Pure-Pleasure, whether this belongs to the Soul in its solitary 
<A NAME="71"></A>state.
<A NAME="72"></A><BR><BR><B>3.</B> We may treat of the Soul as in the body- whether it be 
<A NAME="73"></A>set above it or actually within it- since the association of the two constitutes 
<A NAME="74"></A>the one thing called the living organism, the Animate.
<A NAME="75"></A><BR><BR>Now from this relation, from the Soul using the body as an instrument, 
<A NAME="76"></A>it does not follow that the Soul must share the body's experiences: a man 
<A NAME="77"></A>does not himself feel all the experiences of the tools with which he is 
<A NAME="78"></A>working.
<A NAME="79"></A><BR><BR>It may be objected that the Soul must however, have Sense-Perception 
<A NAME="80"></A>since its use of its instrument must acquaint it with the external conditions, 
<A NAME="81"></A>and such knowledge comes by way of sense. Thus, it will be argued, the 
<A NAME="82"></A>eyes are the instrument of seeing, and seeing may bring distress to the 
<A NAME="83"></A>soul: hence the Soul may feel sorrow and pain and every other affection 
<A NAME="84"></A>that belongs to the body; and from this again will spring desire, the Soul 
<A NAME="85"></A>seeking the mending of its instrument.
<A NAME="86"></A><BR><BR>But, we ask, how, possibly, can these affections pass from body 
<A NAME="87"></A>to Soul? Body may communicate qualities or conditions to another body: 
<A NAME="88"></A>but- body to Soul? Something happens to A; does that make it happen to 
<A NAME="89"></A>B? As long as we have agent and instrument, there are two distinct entities; 
<A NAME="90"></A>if the Soul uses the body it is separate from it.
<A NAME="91"></A><BR><BR>But apart from the philosophical separation how does Soul stand 
<A NAME="92"></A>to body?
<A NAME="93"></A><BR><BR>Clearly there is a combination. And for this several modes are 
<A NAME="94"></A>possible. There might be a complete coalescence: Soul might be interwoven 
<A NAME="95"></A>through the body: or it might be an Ideal-Form detached or an Ideal-Form 
<A NAME="96"></A>in governing contact like a pilot: or there might be part of the Soul detached 
<A NAME="97"></A>and another part in contact, the disjoined part being the agent or user, 
<A NAME="98"></A>the conjoined part ranking with the instrument or thing 
<A NAME="99"></A>used.
<A NAME="100"></A><BR><BR>In this last case it will be the double task of philosophy to direct 
<A NAME="101"></A>this lower Soul towards the higher, the agent, and except in so far as 
<A NAME="102"></A>the conjunction is absolutely necessary, to sever the agent from the instrument, 
<A NAME="103"></A>the body, so that it need not forever have its Act upon or through this 
<A NAME="104"></A>inferior.
<A NAME="105"></A><BR><BR><B>4.</B> Let us consider, then, the hypothesis of a 
<A NAME="106"></A>coalescence.
<A NAME="107"></A><BR>Now if there is a coalescence, the lower is ennobled, the nobler degraded; 
<A NAME="108"></A>the body is raised in the scale of being as made participant in life; the 
<A NAME="109"></A>Soul, as associated with death and unreason, is brought lower. How can 
<A NAME="110"></A>a lessening of the life-quality produce an increase such as 
<A NAME="111"></A>Sense-Perception?
<A NAME="112"></A><BR><BR>No: the body has acquired life, it is the body that will acquire, 
<A NAME="113"></A>with life, sensation and the affections coming by sensation. Desire, then, 
<A NAME="114"></A>will belong to the body, as the objects of desire are to be enjoyed by 
<A NAME="115"></A>the body. And fear, too, will belong to the body alone; for it is the body's 
<A NAME="116"></A>doom to fail of its joys and to perish.
<A NAME="117"></A><BR><BR>Then again we should have to examine how such a coalescence could 
<A NAME="118"></A>be conceived: we might find it impossible: perhaps all this is like announcing 
<A NAME="119"></A>the coalescence of things utterly incongruous in kind, let us say of a 
<A NAME="120"></A>line and whiteness.
<A NAME="121"></A><BR><BR>Next for the suggestion that the Soul is interwoven through the 
<A NAME="122"></A>body: such a relation would not give woof and warp community of sensation: 
<A NAME="123"></A>the interwoven element might very well suffer no change: the permeating 
<A NAME="124"></A>soul might remain entirely untouched by what affects the body- as light 
<A NAME="125"></A>goes always free of all it floods- and all the more so, since, precisely, 
<A NAME="126"></A>we are asked to consider it as diffused throughout the entire 
<A NAME="127"></A>frame.
<A NAME="128"></A><BR><BR>Under such an interweaving, then, the Soul would not be subjected 
<A NAME="129"></A>to the body's affections and experiences: it would be present rather as 
<A NAME="130"></A>Ideal-Form in Matter.
<A NAME="131"></A><BR><BR>Let us then suppose Soul to be in body as Ideal-Form in Matter. 
<A NAME="132"></A>Now if- the first possibility- the Soul is an essence, a self-existent, 
<A NAME="133"></A>it can be present only as separable form and will therefore all the more 
<A NAME="134"></A>decidedly be the Using-Principle [and therefore unaffected].
<A NAME="135"></A><BR><BR>Suppose, next, the Soul to be present like axe-form on iron: here, 
<A NAME="136"></A>no doubt, the form is all important but it is still the axe, the complement 
<A NAME="137"></A>of iron and form, that effects whatever is effected by the iron thus modified: 
<A NAME="138"></A>on this analogy, therefore, we are even more strictly compelled to assign 
<A NAME="139"></A>all the experiences of the combination to the body: their natural seat 
<A NAME="140"></A>is the material member, the instrument, the potential recipient of 
<A NAME="141"></A>life.
<A NAME="142"></A><BR><BR>Compare the passage where we read* that "it is absurd to suppose 
<A NAME="143"></A>that the Soul weaves"; equally absurd to think of it as desiring, grieving. 
<A NAME="144"></A>All this is rather in the province of something which we may call the 
<A NAME="145"></A>Animate.
<A NAME="146"></A><BR><BR>* "We read" translates "he says" of the text, and always indicates 
<A NAME="147"></A>a reference to Plato, whose name does not appear in the translation except 
<A NAME="148"></A>where it was written by Plotinus. S.M.
<A NAME="149"></A><BR><BR><B>5.</B> Now this Animate might be merely the body as having life: 
<A NAME="150"></A>it might be the Couplement of Soul and body: it might be a third and different 
<A NAME="151"></A>entity formed from both.
<A NAME="152"></A><BR><BR>The Soul in turn- apart from the nature of the Animate- must be 
<A NAME="153"></A>either impassive, merely causing Sense-Perception in its yoke-fellow, or 
<A NAME="154"></A>sympathetic; and, if sympathetic, it may have identical experiences with 
<A NAME="155"></A>its fellow or merely correspondent experiences: desire for example in the 
<A NAME="156"></A>Animate may be something quite distinct from the accompanying movement 
<A NAME="157"></A>or state in the desiring faculty.
<A NAME="158"></A><BR><BR>The body, the live-body as we know it, we will consider 
<A NAME="159"></A>later.
<A NAME="160"></A><BR>Let us take first the Couplement of body and Soul. How could suffering, 
<A NAME="161"></A>for example, be seated in this Couplement?
<A NAME="162"></A><BR><BR>It may be suggested that some unwelcome state of the body produces 
<A NAME="163"></A>a distress which reaches to a Sensitive-Faculty which in turn merges into 
<A NAME="164"></A>Soul. But this account still leaves the origin of the sensation 
<A NAME="165"></A>unexplained.
<A NAME="166"></A><BR><BR>Another suggestion might be that all is due to an opinion or judgement: 
<A NAME="167"></A>some evil seems to have befallen the man or his belongings and this conviction 
<A NAME="168"></A>sets up a state of trouble in the body and in the entire Animate. But this 
<A NAME="169"></A>account leaves still a question as to the source and seat of the judgement: 
<A NAME="170"></A>does it belong to the Soul or to the Couplement? Besides, the judgement 
<A NAME="171"></A>that evil is present does not involve the feeling of grief: the judgement 
<A NAME="172"></A>might very well arise and the grief by no means follow: one may think oneself 
<A NAME="173"></A>slighted and yet not be angry; and the appetite is not necessarily excited 
<A NAME="174"></A>by the thought of a pleasure. We are, thus, no nearer than before to any 
<A NAME="175"></A>warrant for assigning these affections to the Couplement.
<A NAME="176"></A><BR><BR>Is it any explanation to say that desire is vested in a Faculty-of-desire 
<A NAME="177"></A>and anger in the Irascible-Faculty and, collectively, that all tendency 
<A NAME="178"></A>is seated in the Appetitive-Faculty? Such a statement of the facts does 
<A NAME="179"></A>not help towards making the affections common to the Couplement; they might 
<A NAME="180"></A>still be seated either in the Soul alone or in the body alone. On the one 
<A NAME="181"></A>hand if the appetite is to be stirred, as in the carnal passion, there 
<A NAME="182"></A>must be a heating of the blood and the bile, a well-defined state of the 
<A NAME="183"></A>body; on the other hand, the impulse towards The Good cannot be a joint 
<A NAME="184"></A>affection, but, like certain others too, it would belong necessarily to 
<A NAME="185"></A>the Soul alone.
<A NAME="186"></A><BR><BR>Reason, then, does not permit us to assign all the affections to 
<A NAME="187"></A>the Couplement.
<A NAME="188"></A><BR><BR>In the case of carnal desire, it will certainly be the Man that 
<A NAME="189"></A>desires, and yet, on the other hand, there must be desire in the Desiring-Faculty 
<A NAME="190"></A>as well. How can this be? Are we to suppose that, when the man originates 
<A NAME="191"></A>the desire, the Desiring-Faculty moves to the order? How could the Man 
<A NAME="192"></A>have come to desire at all unless through a prior activity in the Desiring-Faculty? 
<A NAME="193"></A>Then it is the Desiring-Faculty that takes the lead? Yet how, unless the 
<A NAME="194"></A>body be first in the appropriate condition?
<A NAME="195"></A><BR><BR><B>6.</B> It may seem reasonable to lay down as a law that when 
<A NAME="196"></A>any powers are contained by a recipient, every action or state expressive 
<A NAME="197"></A>of them must be the action or state of that recipient, they themselves 
<A NAME="198"></A>remaining unaffected as merely furnishing efficiency.
<A NAME="199"></A><BR><BR>But if this were so, then, since the Animate is the recipient of 
<A NAME="200"></A>the Causing-Principle [i.e., the Soul] which brings life to the Couplement, 
<A NAME="201"></A>this Cause must itself remain unaffected, all the experiences and expressive 
<A NAME="202"></A>activities of the life being vested in the recipient, the 
<A NAME="203"></A>Animate.
<A NAME="204"></A><BR><BR>But this would mean that life itself belongs not to the Soul but 
<A NAME="205"></A>to the Couplement; or at least the life of the Couplement would not be 
<A NAME="206"></A>the life of the Soul; Sense-Perception would belong not to the Sensitive-Faculty 
<A NAME="207"></A>but to the container of the faculty.
<A NAME="208"></A><BR><BR>But if sensation is a movement traversing the body and culminating 
<A NAME="209"></A>in Soul, how the soul lack sensation? The very presence of the Sensitive-Faculty 
<A NAME="210"></A>must assure sensation to the Soul.
<A NAME="211"></A><BR><BR>Once again, where is Sense-Perception seated?
<A NAME="212"></A><BR>In the Couplement.
<A NAME="213"></A><BR>Yet how can the Couplement have sensation independently of action in 
<A NAME="214"></A>the Sensitive-Faculty, the Soul left out of count and the 
<A NAME="215"></A>Soul-Faculty?
<A NAME="216"></A><BR><BR><B>7.</B> The truth lies in the Consideration that the Couplement 
<A NAME="217"></A>subsists by virtue of the Soul's presence.
<A NAME="218"></A><BR><BR>This, however, is not to say that the Soul gives itself as it is 
<A NAME="219"></A>in itself to form either the Couplement or the body.
<A NAME="220"></A><BR><BR>No; from the organized body and something else, let us say a light, 
<A NAME="221"></A>which the Soul gives forth from itself, it forms a distinct Principle, 
<A NAME="222"></A>the Animate; and in this Principle are vested Sense-Perception and all 
<A NAME="223"></A>the other experiences found to belong to the Animate.
<A NAME="224"></A><BR><BR>But the "We"? How have We Sense-Perception?
<A NAME="225"></A><BR>By the fact that We are not separate from the Animate so constituted, 
<A NAME="226"></A>even though certainly other and nobler elements go to make up the entire 
<A NAME="227"></A>many-sided nature of Man.
<A NAME="228"></A><BR><BR>The faculty of perception in the Soul cannot act by the immediate 
<A NAME="229"></A>grasping of sensible objects, but only by the discerning of impressions 
<A NAME="230"></A>printed upon the Animate by sensation: these impressions are already Intelligibles 
<A NAME="231"></A>while the outer sensation is a mere phantom of the other [of that in the 
<A NAME="232"></A>Soul] which is nearer to Authentic-Existence as being an impassive reading 
<A NAME="233"></A>of Ideal-Forms.
<A NAME="234"></A><BR><BR>And by means of these Ideal-Forms, by which the Soul wields single 
<A NAME="235"></A>lordship over the Animate, we have Discursive-Reasoning, Sense-Knowledge 
<A NAME="236"></A>and Intellection. From this moment we have peculiarly the We: before this 
<A NAME="237"></A>there was only the "Ours"; but at this stage stands the WE [the authentic 
<A NAME="238"></A>Human-Principle] loftily presiding over the Animate.
<A NAME="239"></A><BR><BR>There is no reason why the entire compound entity should not be 
<A NAME="240"></A>described as the Animate or Living-Being- mingled in a lower phase, but 
<A NAME="241"></A>above that point the beginning of the veritable man, distinct from all 
<A NAME="242"></A>that is kin to the lion, all that is of the order of the multiple brute. 
<A NAME="243"></A>And since The Man, so understood, is essentially the associate of the reasoning 
<A NAME="244"></A>Soul, in our reasoning it is this "We" that reasons, in that the use and 
<A NAME="245"></A>act of reason is a characteristic Act of the Soul.
<A NAME="246"></A><BR><BR><B>8.</B> And towards the Intellectual-Principle what is our relation? 
<A NAME="247"></A>By this I mean, not that faculty in the soul which is one of the emanations 
<A NAME="248"></A>from the Intellectual-Principle, but The Intellectual-Principle itself 
<A NAME="249"></A>[Divine-Mind].
<A NAME="250"></A><BR><BR>This also we possess as the summit of our being. And we have It 
<A NAME="251"></A>either as common to all or as our own immediate possession: or again we 
<A NAME="252"></A>may possess It in both degrees, that is in common, since It is indivisible- 
<A NAME="253"></A>one, everywhere and always Its entire self- and severally in that each 
<A NAME="254"></A>personality possesses It entire in the First-Soul [i.e. in the Intellectual 
<A NAME="255"></A>as distinguished from the lower phase of the Soul].
<A NAME="256"></A><BR><BR>Hence we possess the Ideal-Forms also after two modes: in the Soul, 
<A NAME="257"></A>as it were unrolled and separate; in the Intellectual-Principle, concentrated, 
<A NAME="258"></A>one.
<A NAME="259"></A><BR><BR>And how do we possess the Divinity?
<A NAME="260"></A><BR>In that the Divinity is contained in the Intellectual-Principle and 
<A NAME="261"></A>Authentic-Existence; and We come third in order after these two, for the 
<A NAME="262"></A>We is constituted by a union of the supreme, the undivided Soul- we read- 
<A NAME="263"></A>and that Soul which is divided among [living] bodies. For, note, we inevitably 
<A NAME="264"></A>think of the Soul, though one undivided in the All, as being present to 
<A NAME="265"></A>bodies in division: in so far as any bodies are Animates, the Soul has 
<A NAME="266"></A>given itself to each of the separate material masses; or rather it appears 
<A NAME="267"></A>to be present in the bodies by the fact that it shines into them: it makes 
<A NAME="268"></A>them living beings not by merging into body but by giving forth, without 
<A NAME="269"></A>any change in itself, images or likenesses of itself like one face caught 
<A NAME="270"></A>by many mirrors.
<A NAME="271"></A><BR><BR>The first of these images is Sense-Perception seated in the Couplement; 
<A NAME="272"></A>and from this downwards all the successive images are to be recognized 
<A NAME="273"></A>as phases of the Soul in lessening succession from one another, until the 
<A NAME="274"></A>series ends in the faculties of generation and growth and of all production 
<A NAME="275"></A>of offspring- offspring efficient in its turn, in contradistinction to 
<A NAME="276"></A>the engendering Soul which [has no direct action within matter but] produces 
<A NAME="277"></A>by mere inclination towards what it fashions.
<A NAME="278"></A><BR><BR><B>9.</B> That Soul, then, in us, will in its nature stand apart 
<A NAME="279"></A>from all that can cause any of the evils which man does or suffers; for 
<A NAME="280"></A>all such evil, as we have seen, belongs only to the Animate, the 
<A NAME="281"></A>Couplement.
<A NAME="282"></A><BR><BR>But there is a difficulty in understanding how the Soul can go 
<A NAME="283"></A>guiltless if our mentation and reasoning are vested in it: for all this 
<A NAME="284"></A>lower kind of knowledge is delusion and is the cause of much of what is 
<A NAME="285"></A>evil.
<A NAME="286"></A><BR><BR>When we have done evil it is because we have been worsted by our 
<A NAME="287"></A>baser side- for a man is many- by desire or rage or some evil image: the 
<A NAME="288"></A>misnamed reasoning that takes up with the false, in reality fancy, has 
<A NAME="289"></A>not stayed for the judgement of the Reasoning-Principle: we have acted 
<A NAME="290"></A>at the call of the less worthy, just as in matters of the sense-sphere 
<A NAME="291"></A>we sometimes see falsely because we credit only the lower perception, that 
<A NAME="292"></A>of the Couplement, without applying the tests of the 
<A NAME="293"></A>Reasoning-Faculty.
<A NAME="294"></A><BR><BR>The Intellectual-Principle has held aloof from the act and so is 
<A NAME="295"></A>guiltless; or, as we may state it, all depends on whether we ourselves 
<A NAME="296"></A>have or have not put ourselves in touch with the Intellectual-Realm either 
<A NAME="297"></A>in the Intellectual-Principle or within ourselves; for it is possible at 
<A NAME="298"></A>once to possess and not to use.
<A NAME="299"></A><BR><BR>Thus we have marked off what belongs to the Couplement from what 
<A NAME="300"></A>stands by itself: the one group has the character of body and never exists 
<A NAME="301"></A>apart from body, while all that has no need of body for its manifestation 
<A NAME="302"></A>belongs peculiarly to Soul: and the Understanding, as passing judgement 
<A NAME="303"></A>upon Sense-Impressions, is at the point of the vision of Ideal-Forms, seeing 
<A NAME="304"></A>them as it were with an answering sensation (i.e, with consciousness) this 
<A NAME="305"></A>last is at any rate true of the Understanding in the Veritable Soul. For 
<A NAME="306"></A>Understanding, the true, is the Act of the Intellections: in many of its 
<A NAME="307"></A>manifestations it is the assimilation and reconciliation of the outer to 
<A NAME="308"></A>the inner.
<A NAME="309"></A><BR><BR>Thus in spite of all, the Soul is at peace as to itself and within 
<A NAME="310"></A>itself: all the changes and all the turmoil we experience are the issue 
<A NAME="311"></A>of what is subjoined to the Soul, and are, as have said, the states and 
<A NAME="312"></A>experiences of this elusive "Couplement."
<A NAME="313"></A><BR><BR><B>10.</B> It will be objected, that if the Soul constitutes the 
<A NAME="314"></A>We [the personality] and We are subject to these states then the Soul must 
<A NAME="315"></A>be subject to them, and similarly that what We do must be done by the 
<A NAME="316"></A>Soul.
<A NAME="317"></A><BR><BR>But it has been observed that the Couplement, too- especially before 
<A NAME="318"></A>our emancipation- is a member of this total We, and in fact what the body 
<A NAME="319"></A>experiences we say We experience. This then covers two distinct notions; 
<A NAME="320"></A>sometimes it includes the brute-part, sometimes it transcends the brute. 
<A NAME="321"></A>The body is brute touched to life; the true man is the other, going pure 
<A NAME="322"></A>of the body, natively endowed with the virtues which belong to the Intellectual-Activity, 
<A NAME="323"></A>virtues whose seat is the Separate Soul, the Soul which even in its dwelling 
<A NAME="324"></A>here may be kept apart. [This Soul constitutes the human being] for when 
<A NAME="325"></A>it has wholly withdrawn, that other Soul which is a radiation [or emanation] 
<A NAME="326"></A>from it withdraws also, drawn after it.
<A NAME="327"></A><BR><BR>Those virtues, on the other hand, which spring not from contemplative 
<A NAME="328"></A>wisdom but from custom or practical discipline belong to the Couplement: 
<A NAME="329"></A>to the Couplement, too, belong the vices; they are its repugnances, desires, 
<A NAME="330"></A>sympathies.
<A NAME="331"></A><BR><BR>And Friendship?
<A NAME="332"></A><BR>This emotion belongs sometimes to the lower part, sometimes to the 
<A NAME="333"></A>interior man.
<A NAME="334"></A><BR><BR><B>11.</B> In childhood the main activity is in the Couplement 
<A NAME="335"></A>and there is but little irradiation from the higher principles of our being: 
<A NAME="336"></A>but when these higher principles act but feebly or rarely upon us their 
<A NAME="337"></A>action is directed towards the Supreme; they work upon us only when they 
<A NAME="338"></A>stand at the mid-point.
<A NAME="339"></A><BR><BR>But does not the include that phase of our being which stands above 
<A NAME="340"></A>the mid-point?
<A NAME="341"></A><BR><BR>It does, but on condition that we lay hold of it: our entire nature 
<A NAME="342"></A>is not ours at all times but only as we direct the mid-point upwards or 
<A NAME="343"></A>downwards, or lead some particular phase of our nature from potentiality 
<A NAME="344"></A>or native character into act.
<A NAME="345"></A><BR><BR>And the animals, in what way or degree do they possess the 
<A NAME="346"></A>Animate?
<A NAME="347"></A><BR><BR>If there be in them, as the opinion goes, human Souls that have 
<A NAME="348"></A>sinned, then the Animating-Principle in its separable phase does not enter 
<A NAME="349"></A>directly into the brute; it is there but not there to them; they are aware 
<A NAME="350"></A>only of the image of the Soul [only of the lower Soul] and of that only 
<A NAME="351"></A>by being aware of the body organised and determined by that 
<A NAME="352"></A>image.
<A NAME="353"></A><BR><BR>If there be no human Soul in them, the Animate is constituted for 
<A NAME="354"></A>them by a radiation from the All-Soul.
<A NAME="355"></A><BR><BR><B>12.</B> But if Soul is sinless, how come the expiations? Here 
<A NAME="356"></A>surely is a contradiction; on the one side the Soul is above all guilt; 
<A NAME="357"></A>on the other, we hear of its sin, its purification, its expiation; it is 
<A NAME="358"></A>doomed to the lower world, it passes from body to body.
<A NAME="359"></A><BR><BR>We may take either view at will: they are easily 
<A NAME="360"></A>reconciled.
<A NAME="361"></A><BR>When we tell of the sinless Soul, we make Soul and Essential-Soul one 
<A NAME="362"></A>and the same: it is the simple unbroken Unity.
<A NAME="363"></A><BR><BR>By the Soul subject to sin we indicate a groupment, we include 
<A NAME="364"></A>that other, that phase of the Soul which knows all the states and passions: 
<A NAME="365"></A>the Soul in this sense is compound, all-inclusive: it falls under the conditions 
<A NAME="366"></A>of the entire living experience: this compound it is that sins; it is this, 
<A NAME="367"></A>and not the other, that pays penalty.
<A NAME="368"></A><BR><BR>It is in this sense that we read of the Soul: "We saw it as those 
<A NAME="369"></A>others saw the sea-god Glaukos." "And," reading on, "if we mean to discern 
<A NAME="370"></A>the nature of the Soul we must strip it free of all that has gathered about 
<A NAME="371"></A>it, must see into the philosophy of it, examine with what Existences it 
<A NAME="372"></A>has touch and by kinship to what Existences it is what it 
<A NAME="373"></A>is."
<A NAME="374"></A><BR><BR>Thus the Life is one thing, the Act is another and the Expiator 
<A NAME="375"></A>yet another. The retreat and sundering, then, must be not from this body 
<A NAME="376"></A>only, but from every alien accruement. Such accruement takes place at birth; 
<A NAME="377"></A>or rather birth is the coming-into-being of that other [lower] phase of 
<A NAME="378"></A>the Soul. For the meaning of birth has been indicated elsewhere; it is 
<A NAME="379"></A>brought about by a descent of the Soul, something being given off by the 
<A NAME="380"></A>Soul other than that actually coming down in the declension.
<A NAME="381"></A><BR><BR>Then the Soul has let this image fall? And this declension is it 
<A NAME="382"></A>not certainly sin?
<A NAME="383"></A><BR><BR>If the declension is no more than the illuminating of an object 
<A NAME="384"></A>beneath, it constitutes no sin: the shadow is to be attributed not to the 
<A NAME="385"></A>luminary but to the object illuminated; if the object were not there, the 
<A NAME="386"></A>light could cause no shadow.
<A NAME="387"></A><BR><BR>And the Soul is said to go down, to decline, only in that the object 
<A NAME="388"></A>it illuminates lives by its life. And it lets the image fall only if there 
<A NAME="389"></A>be nothing near to take it up; and it lets it fall, not as a thing cut 
<A NAME="390"></A>off, but as a thing that ceases to be: the image has no further being when 
<A NAME="391"></A>the whole Soul is looking toward the Supreme.
<A NAME="392"></A><BR><BR>The poet, too, in the story of Hercules, seems to give this image 
<A NAME="393"></A>separate existence; he puts the shade of Hercules in the lower world and 
<A NAME="394"></A>Hercules himself among the gods: treating the hero as existing in the two 
<A NAME="395"></A>realms at once, he gives us a twofold Hercules.
<A NAME="396"></A><BR><BR>It is not difficult to explain this distinction. Hercules was a 
<A NAME="397"></A>hero of practical virtue. By his noble serviceableness he was worthy to 
<A NAME="398"></A>be a God. On the other hand, his merit was action and not the Contemplation 
<A NAME="399"></A>which would place him unreservedly in the higher realm. Therefore while 
<A NAME="400"></A>he has place above, something of him remains below.
<A NAME="401"></A><BR><BR><B>13.</B> And the principle that reasons out these matters? Is 
<A NAME="402"></A>it We or the Soul?
<A NAME="403"></A><BR><BR>We, but by the Soul.
<A NAME="404"></A><BR>But how "by the Soul"? Does this mean that the Soul reasons by possession 
<A NAME="405"></A>[by contact with the matters of enquiry]?
<A NAME="406"></A><BR><BR>No; by the fact of being Soul. Its Act subsists without movement; 
<A NAME="407"></A>or any movement that can be ascribed to it must be utterly distinct from 
<A NAME="408"></A>all corporal movement and be simply the Soul's own life.
<A NAME="409"></A><BR><BR>And Intellection in us is twofold: since the Soul is intellective, 
<A NAME="410"></A>and Intellection is the highest phase of life, we have Intellection both 
<A NAME="411"></A>by the characteristic Act of our Soul and by the Act of the Intellectual-Principle 
<A NAME="412"></A>upon us- for this Intellectual-Principle is part of us no less than the 
<A NAME="413"></A>Soul, and towards it we are ever rising.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="414"></A><B>Second Tractate</B>

<A NAME="415"></A><BR><BR><B>ON VIRTUE.</B>
<A NAME="416"></A><BR><BR><B>1.</B> Since Evil is here, "haunting this world by necessary 
<A NAME="417"></A>law," and it is the Soul's design to escape from Evil, we must escape 
<A NAME="418"></A>hence.
<A NAME="419"></A><BR><BR>But what is this escape?
<A NAME="420"></A><BR>"In attaining Likeness to God," we read. And this is explained as "becoming 
<A NAME="421"></A>just and holy, living by wisdom," the entire nature grounded in 
<A NAME="422"></A>Virtue.
<A NAME="423"></A><BR><BR>But does not Likeness by way of Virtue imply Likeness to some being 
<A NAME="424"></A>that has Virtue? To what Divine Being, then, would our Likeness be? To 
<A NAME="425"></A>the Being- must we not think?- in Which, above all, such excellence seems 
<A NAME="426"></A>to inhere, that is to the Soul of the Kosmos and to the Principle ruling 
<A NAME="427"></A>within it, the Principle endowed with a wisdom most wonderful. What could 
<A NAME="428"></A>be more fitting than that we, living in this world, should become Like 
<A NAME="429"></A>to its ruler?
<A NAME="430"></A><BR><BR>But, at the beginning, we are met by the doubt whether even in 
<A NAME="431"></A>this Divine-Being all the virtues find place- Moral-Balance [Sophrosyne], 
<A NAME="432"></A>for example; or Fortitude where there can be no danger since nothing is 
<A NAME="433"></A>alien; where there can be nothing alluring whose lack could induce the 
<A NAME="434"></A>desire of possession.
<A NAME="435"></A><BR><BR>If, indeed, that aspiration towards the Intelligible which is in 
<A NAME="436"></A>our nature exists also in this Ruling-Power, then need not look elsewhere 
<A NAME="437"></A>for the source of order and of the virtues in ourselves.
<A NAME="438"></A><BR><BR>But does this Power possess the Virtues?
<A NAME="439"></A><BR>We cannot expect to find There what are called the Civic Virtues, the 
<A NAME="440"></A>Prudence which belongs to the reasoning faculty; the Fortitude which conducts 
<A NAME="441"></A>the emotional and passionate nature; the Sophrosyne which consists in a 
<A NAME="442"></A>certain pact, in a concord between the passionate faculty and the reason; 
<A NAME="443"></A>or Rectitude which is the due application of all the other virtues as each 
<A NAME="444"></A>in turn should command or obey.
<A NAME="445"></A><BR><BR>Is Likeness, then, attained, perhaps, not by these virtues of the 
<A NAME="446"></A>social order but by those greater qualities known by the same general name? 
<A NAME="447"></A>And if so do the Civic Virtues give us no help at all?
<A NAME="448"></A><BR><BR>It is against reason, utterly to deny Likeness by these while admitting 
<A NAME="449"></A>it by the greater: tradition at least recognizes certain men of the civic 
<A NAME="450"></A>excellence as divine, and we must believe that these too had in some sort 
<A NAME="451"></A>attained Likeness: on both levels there is virtue for us, though not the 
<A NAME="452"></A>same virtue.
<A NAME="453"></A><BR><BR>Now, if it be admitted that Likeness is possible, though by a varying 
<A NAME="454"></A>use of different virtues and though the civic virtues do not suffice, there 
<A NAME="455"></A>is no reason why we should not, by virtues peculiar to our state, attain 
<A NAME="456"></A>Likeness to a model in which virtue has no place.
<A NAME="457"></A><BR><BR>But is that conceivable?
<A NAME="458"></A><BR>When warmth comes in to make anything warm, must there needs be something 
<A NAME="459"></A>to warm the source of the warmth?
<A NAME="460"></A><BR><BR>If a fire is to warm something else, must there be a fire to warm 
<A NAME="461"></A>that fire?
<A NAME="462"></A><BR><BR>Against the first illustration it may be retorted that the source 
<A NAME="463"></A>of the warmth does already contain warmth, not by an infusion but as an 
<A NAME="464"></A>essential phase of its nature, so that, if the analogy is to hold, the 
<A NAME="465"></A>argument would make Virtue something communicated to the Soul but an essential 
<A NAME="466"></A>constituent of the Principle from which the Soul attaining Likeness absorbs 
<A NAME="467"></A>it.
<A NAME="468"></A><BR><BR>Against the illustration drawn from the fire, it may be urged that 
<A NAME="469"></A>the analogy would make that Principle identical with virtue, whereas we 
<A NAME="470"></A>hold it to be something higher.
<A NAME="471"></A><BR><BR>The objection would be valid if what the soul takes in were one 
<A NAME="472"></A>and the same with the source, but in fact virtue is one thing, the source 
<A NAME="473"></A>of virtue quite another. The material house is not identical with the house 
<A NAME="474"></A>conceived in the intellect, and yet stands in its likeness: the material 
<A NAME="475"></A>house has distribution and order while the pure idea is not constituted 
<A NAME="476"></A>by any such elements; distribution, order, symmetry are not parts of an 
<A NAME="477"></A>idea.
<A NAME="478"></A><BR><BR>So with us: it is from the Supreme that we derive order and distribution 
<A NAME="479"></A>and harmony, which are virtues in this sphere: the Existences There, having 
<A NAME="480"></A>no need of harmony, order or distribution, have nothing to do with virtue; 
<A NAME="481"></A>and, none the less, it is by our possession of virtue that we become like 
<A NAME="482"></A>to Them.
<A NAME="483"></A><BR><BR>Thus much to show that the principle that we attain Likeness by 
<A NAME="484"></A>virtue in no way involves the existence of virtue in the Supreme. But we 
<A NAME="485"></A>have not merely to make a formal demonstration: we must persuade as well 
<A NAME="486"></A>as demonstrate.
<A NAME="487"></A><BR><BR><B>2.</B> First, then, let us examine those good qualities by which 
<A NAME="488"></A>we hold Likeness comes, and seek to establish what is this thing which, 
<A NAME="489"></A>as we possess it, in transcription, is virtue but as the Supreme possesses 
<A NAME="490"></A>it, is in the nature of an exemplar or archetype and is not 
<A NAME="491"></A>virtue.
<A NAME="492"></A><BR><BR>We must first distinguish two modes of Likeness.
<A NAME="493"></A><BR>There is the likeness demanding an identical nature in the objects 
<A NAME="494"></A>which, further, must draw their likeness from a common principle: and there 
<A NAME="495"></A>is the case in which B resembles A, but A is a Primal, not concerned about 
<A NAME="496"></A>B and not said to resemble B. In this second case, likeness is understood 
<A NAME="497"></A>in a distinct sense: we no longer look for identity of nature, but, on 
<A NAME="498"></A>the contrary, for divergence since the likeness has come about by the mode 
<A NAME="499"></A>of difference.
<A NAME="500"></A><BR><BR>What, then, precisely is Virtue, collectively and in the particular? 
<A NAME="501"></A>The clearer method will be to begin with the particular, for so the common 
<A NAME="502"></A>element by which all the forms hold the general name will readily 
<A NAME="503"></A>appear.
<A NAME="504"></A><BR><BR>The Civic Virtues, on which we have touched above, are a principle 
<A NAME="505"></A>or order and beauty in us as long as we remain passing our life here: they 
<A NAME="506"></A>ennoble us by setting bound and measure to our desires and to our entire 
<A NAME="507"></A>sensibility, and dispelling false judgement- and this by sheer efficacy 
<A NAME="508"></A>of the better, by the very setting of the bounds, by the fact that the 
<A NAME="509"></A>measured is lifted outside of the sphere of the unmeasured and 
<A NAME="510"></A>lawless.
<A NAME="511"></A><BR><BR>And, further, these Civic Virtues- measured and ordered themselves 
<A NAME="512"></A>and acting as a principle of measure to the Soul which is as Matter to 
<A NAME="513"></A>their forming- are like to the measure reigning in the over-world, and 
<A NAME="514"></A>they carry a trace of that Highest Good in the Supreme; for, while utter 
<A NAME="515"></A>measurelessness is brute Matter and wholly outside of Likeness, any participation 
<A NAME="516"></A>in Ideal-Form produces some corresponding degree of Likeness to the formless 
<A NAME="517"></A>Being There. And participation goes by nearness: the Soul nearer than the 
<A NAME="518"></A>body, therefore closer akin, participates more fully and shows a godlike 
<A NAME="519"></A>presence, almost cheating us into the delusion that in the Soul we see 
<A NAME="520"></A>God entire.
<A NAME="521"></A><BR><BR>This is the way in which men of the Civic Virtues attain 
<A NAME="522"></A>Likeness.
<A NAME="523"></A><BR><B>3.</B> We come now to that other mode of Likeness which, we read, 
<A NAME="524"></A>is the fruit of the loftier virtues: discussing this we shall penetrate 
<A NAME="525"></A>more deeply into the essence of the Civic Virtue and be able to define 
<A NAME="526"></A>the nature of the higher kind whose existence we shall establish beyond 
<A NAME="527"></A>doubt.
<A NAME="528"></A><BR><BR>To Plato, unmistakably, there are two distinct orders of virtue, 
<A NAME="529"></A>and the civic does not suffice for Likeness: "Likeness to God," he says, 
<A NAME="530"></A>"is a flight from this world's ways and things": in dealing with the qualities 
<A NAME="531"></A>of good citizenship he does not use the simple term Virtue but adds the 
<A NAME="532"></A>distinguishing word civic: and elsewhere he declares all the virtues without 
<A NAME="533"></A>exception to be purifications.
<A NAME="534"></A><BR><BR>But in what sense can we call the virtues purifications, and how 
<A NAME="535"></A>does purification issue in Likeness?
<A NAME="536"></A><BR><BR>As the Soul is evil by being interfused with the body, and by coming 
<A NAME="537"></A>to share the body's states and to think the body's thoughts, so it would 
<A NAME="538"></A>be good, it would be possessed of virtue, if it threw off the body's moods 
<A NAME="539"></A>and devoted itself to its own Act- the state of Intellection and Wisdom- 
<A NAME="540"></A>never allowed the passions of the body to affect it- the virtue of Sophrosyne- 
<A NAME="541"></A>knew no fear at the parting from the body- the virtue of Fortitude- and 
<A NAME="542"></A>if reason and the Intellectual-Principle ruled- in which state is Righteousness. 
<A NAME="543"></A>Such a disposition in the Soul, become thus intellective and immune to 
<A NAME="544"></A>passion, it would not be wrong to call Likeness to God; for the Divine, 
<A NAME="545"></A>too, is pure and the Divine-Act is such that Likeness to it is 
<A NAME="546"></A>Wisdom.
<A NAME="547"></A><BR><BR>But would not this make virtue a state of the Divine 
<A NAME="548"></A>also?
<A NAME="549"></A><BR>No: the Divine has no states; the state is in the Soul. The Act of 
<A NAME="550"></A>Intellection in the Soul is not the same as in the Divine: of things in 
<A NAME="551"></A>the Supreme, Soul grasps some after a mode of its own, some not at 
<A NAME="552"></A>all.
<A NAME="553"></A><BR><BR>Then yet again, the one word Intellection covers two distinct 
<A NAME="554"></A>Acts?
<A NAME="555"></A><BR><BR>Rather there is primal Intellection and there is Intellection deriving 
<A NAME="556"></A>from the Primal and of other scope.
<A NAME="557"></A><BR><BR>As speech is the echo of the thought in the Soul, so thought in 
<A NAME="558"></A>the Soul is an echo from elsewhere: that is to say, as the uttered thought 
<A NAME="559"></A>is an image of the soul-thought, so the soul-thought images a thought above 
<A NAME="560"></A>itself and is the interpreter of the higher sphere.
<A NAME="561"></A><BR><BR>Virtue, in the same way, is a thing of the Soul: it does not belong 
<A NAME="562"></A>to the Intellectual-Principle or to the Transcendence.
<A NAME="563"></A><BR><BR><B>4.</B> We come, so, to the question whether Purification is 
<A NAME="564"></A>the whole of this human quality, virtue, or merely the forerunner upon 
<A NAME="565"></A>which virtue follows? Does virtue imply the achieved state of purification 
<A NAME="566"></A>or does the mere process suffice to it, Virtue being something of less 
<A NAME="567"></A>perfection than the accomplished pureness which is almost the 
<A NAME="568"></A>Term?
<A NAME="569"></A><BR><BR>To have been purified is to have cleansed away everything alien: 
<A NAME="570"></A>but Goodness is something more.
<A NAME="571"></A><BR><BR>If before the impurity entered there was Goodness, the Goodness 
<A NAME="572"></A>suffices; but even so, not the act of cleansing but the cleansed thing 
<A NAME="573"></A>that emerges will be The Good. And it remains to establish what this emergent 
<A NAME="574"></A>is.
<A NAME="575"></A><BR><BR>It can scarcely prove to be The Good: The Absolute Good cannot 
<A NAME="576"></A>be thought to have taken up its abode with Evil. We can think of it only 
<A NAME="577"></A>as something of the nature of good but paying a double allegiance and unable 
<A NAME="578"></A>to rest in the Authentic Good.
<A NAME="579"></A><BR><BR>The Soul's true Good is in devotion to the Intellectual-Principle, 
<A NAME="580"></A>its kin; evil to the Soul lies in frequenting strangers. There is no other 
<A NAME="581"></A>way for it than to purify itself and so enter into relation with its own; 
<A NAME="582"></A>the new phase begins by a new orientation.
<A NAME="583"></A><BR><BR>After the Purification, then, there is still this orientation to 
<A NAME="584"></A>be made? No: by the purification the true alignment stands 
<A NAME="585"></A>accomplished.
<A NAME="586"></A><BR><BR>The Soul's virtue, then, is this alignment? No: it is what the 
<A NAME="587"></A>alignment brings about within.
<A NAME="588"></A><BR><BR>And this is...?
<A NAME="589"></A><BR>That it sees; that, like sight affected by the thing seen, the soul 
<A NAME="590"></A>admits the imprint, graven upon it and working within it, of the vision 
<A NAME="591"></A>it has come to.
<A NAME="592"></A><BR><BR>But was not the Soul possessed of all this always, or had it 
<A NAME="593"></A>forgotten?
<A NAME="594"></A><BR><BR>What it now sees, it certainly always possessed, but as lying away 
<A NAME="595"></A>in the dark, not as acting within it: to dispel the darkness, and thus 
<A NAME="596"></A>come to knowledge of its inner content, it must thrust towards the 
<A NAME="597"></A>light.
<A NAME="598"></A><BR><BR>Besides, it possessed not the originals but images, pictures; and 
<A NAME="599"></A>these it must bring into closer accord with the verities they represent. 
<A NAME="600"></A>And, further, if the Intellectual-Principle is said to be a possession 
<A NAME="601"></A>of the Soul, this is only in the sense that It is not alien and that the 
<A NAME="602"></A>link becomes very close when the Soul's sight is turned towards It: otherwise, 
<A NAME="603"></A>ever-present though It be, It remains foreign, just as our knowledge, if 
<A NAME="604"></A>it does not determine action, is dead to us.
<A NAME="605"></A><BR><BR><B>5.</B> So we come to the scope of the purification: that understood, 
<A NAME="606"></A>the nature of Likeness becomes clear. Likeness to what Principle? Identity 
<A NAME="607"></A>with what God?
<A NAME="608"></A><BR><BR>The question is substantially this: how far does purification dispel 
<A NAME="609"></A>the two orders of passion- anger, desire and the like, with grief and its 
<A NAME="610"></A>kin- and in what degree the disengagement from the body is 
<A NAME="611"></A>possible.
<A NAME="612"></A><BR><BR>Disengagement means simply that the soul withdraws to its own 
<A NAME="613"></A>place.
<A NAME="614"></A><BR><BR>It will hold itself above all passions and affections. Necessary 
<A NAME="615"></A>pleasures and all the activity of the senses it will employ only for medicament 
<A NAME="616"></A>and assuagement lest its work be impeded. Pain it may combat, but, failing 
<A NAME="617"></A>the cure, it will bear meekly and ease it by refusing assent to it. All 
<A NAME="618"></A>passionate action it will check: the suppression will be complete if that 
<A NAME="619"></A>be possible, but at worst the Soul will never itself take fire but will 
<A NAME="620"></A>keep the involuntary and uncontrolled outside its precincts and rare and 
<A NAME="621"></A>weak at that. The Soul has nothing to dread, though no doubt the involuntary 
<A NAME="622"></A>has some power here too: fear therefore must cease, except so far as it 
<A NAME="623"></A>is purely monitory. What desire there may be can never be for the vile; 
<A NAME="624"></A>even the food and drink necessary for restoration will lie outside of the 
<A NAME="625"></A>Soul's attention, and not less the sexual appetite: or if such desire there 
<A NAME="626"></A>must be, it will turn upon the actual needs of the nature and be entirely 
<A NAME="627"></A>under control; or if any uncontrolled motion takes place, it will reach 
<A NAME="628"></A>no further than the imagination, be no more than a fleeting 
<A NAME="629"></A>fancy.
<A NAME="630"></A><BR><BR>The Soul itself will be inviolately free and will be working to 
<A NAME="631"></A>set the irrational part of the nature above all attack, or if that may 
<A NAME="632"></A>not be, then at least to preserve it from violent assault, so that any 
<A NAME="633"></A>wound it takes may be slight and be healed at once by virtue of the Soul's 
<A NAME="634"></A>presence, just as a man living next door to a Sage would profit by the 
<A NAME="635"></A>neighbourhood, either in becoming wise and good himself or, for sheer shame, 
<A NAME="636"></A>never venturing any act which the nobler mind would 
<A NAME="637"></A>disapprove.
<A NAME="638"></A><BR><BR>There will be no battling in the Soul: the mere intervention of 
<A NAME="639"></A>Reason is enough: the lower nature will stand in such awe of Reason that 
<A NAME="640"></A>for any slightest movement it has made it will grieve, and censure its 
<A NAME="641"></A>own weakness, in not having kept low and still in the presence of its 
<A NAME="642"></A>lord.
<A NAME="643"></A><BR><BR><B>6.</B> In all this there is no sin- there is only matter of 
<A NAME="644"></A>discipline- but our concern is not merely to be sinless but to be 
<A NAME="645"></A>God.
<A NAME="646"></A><BR><BR>As long as there is any such involuntary action, the nature is 
<A NAME="647"></A>twofold, God and Demi-God, or rather God in association with a nature of 
<A NAME="648"></A>a lower power: when all the involuntary is suppressed, there is God unmingled, 
<A NAME="649"></A>a Divine Being of those that follow upon The First.
<A NAME="650"></A><BR><BR>For, at this height, the man is the very being that came from the 
<A NAME="651"></A>Supreme. The primal excellence restored, the essential man is There: entering 
<A NAME="652"></A>this sphere, he has associated himself with the reasoning phase of his 
<A NAME="653"></A>nature and this he will lead up into likeness with his highest self, as 
<A NAME="654"></A>far as earthly mind is capable, so that if possible it shall never be inclined 
<A NAME="655"></A>to, and at the least never adopt, any course displeasing to its 
<A NAME="656"></A>overlord.
<A NAME="657"></A><BR><BR>What form, then, does virtue take in one so 
<A NAME="658"></A>lofty?
<A NAME="659"></A><BR>It appears as Wisdom, which consists in the contemplation of all that 
<A NAME="660"></A>exists in the Intellectual-Principle, and as the immediate presence of 
<A NAME="661"></A>the Intellectual-Principle itself.
<A NAME="662"></A><BR><BR>And each of these has two modes or aspects: there is Wisdom as 
<A NAME="663"></A>it is in the Intellectual-Principle and as in the Soul; and there is the 
<A NAME="664"></A>Intellectual-Principle as it is present to itself and as it is present 
<A NAME="665"></A>to the Soul: this gives what in the Soul is Virtue, in the Supreme not 
<A NAME="666"></A>Virtue.
<A NAME="667"></A><BR><BR>In the Supreme, then, what is it?
<A NAME="668"></A><BR>Its proper Act and Its Essence.
<A NAME="669"></A><BR>That Act and Essence of the Supreme, manifested in a new form, constitute 
<A NAME="670"></A>the virtue of this sphere. For the Supreme is not self-existent justice, 
<A NAME="671"></A>or the Absolute of any defined virtue: it is, so to speak, an exemplar, 
<A NAME="672"></A>the source of what in the soul becomes virtue: for virtue is dependent, 
<A NAME="673"></A>seated in something not itself; the Supreme is self-standing, 
<A NAME="674"></A>independent.
<A NAME="675"></A><BR><BR>But taking Rectitude to be the due ordering of faculty, does it 
<A NAME="676"></A>not always imply the existence of diverse parts?
<A NAME="677"></A><BR><BR>No: There is a Rectitude of Diversity appropriate to what has parts, 
<A NAME="678"></A>but there is another, not less Rectitude than the former though it resides 
<A NAME="679"></A>in a Unity. And the authentic Absolute-Rectitude is the Act of a Unity 
<A NAME="680"></A>upon itself, of a Unity in which there is no this and that and the 
<A NAME="681"></A>other.
<A NAME="682"></A><BR><BR>On this principle, the supreme Rectitude of the Soul is that it 
<A NAME="683"></A>direct its Act towards the Intellectual-Principle: its Restraint (Sophrosyne) 
<A NAME="684"></A>is its inward bending towards the Intellectual-Principle; its Fortitude 
<A NAME="685"></A>is its being impassive in the likeness of That towards which its gaze is 
<A NAME="686"></A>set, Whose nature comports an impassivity which the Soul acquires by virtue 
<A NAME="687"></A>and must acquire if it is not to be at the mercy of every state arising 
<A NAME="688"></A>in its less noble companion.
<A NAME="689"></A><BR><BR><B>7.</B> The virtues in the Soul run in a sequence correspondent 
<A NAME="690"></A>to that existing in the over-world, that is among their exemplars in the 
<A NAME="691"></A>Intellectual-Principle.
<A NAME="692"></A><BR><BR>In the Supreme, Intellection constitutes Knowledge and Wisdom; 
<A NAME="693"></A>self-concentration is Sophrosyne; Its proper Act is Its Dutifulness; Its 
<A NAME="694"></A>Immateriality, by which It remains inviolate within Itself is the equivalent 
<A NAME="695"></A>of Fortitude.
<A NAME="696"></A><BR><BR>In the Soul, the direction of vision towards the Intellectual-Principle 
<A NAME="697"></A>is Wisdom and Prudence, soul-virtues not appropriate to the Supreme where 
<A NAME="698"></A>Thinker and Thought are identical. All the other virtues have similar 
<A NAME="699"></A>correspondences.
<A NAME="700"></A><BR><BR>And if the term of purification is the production of a pure being, 
<A NAME="701"></A>then the purification of the Soul must produce all the virtues; if any 
<A NAME="702"></A>are lacking, then not one of them is perfect.
<A NAME="703"></A><BR><BR>And to possess the greater is potentially to possess the minor, 
<A NAME="704"></A>though the minor need not carry the greater with them.
<A NAME="705"></A><BR><BR>Thus we have indicated the dominant note in the life of the Sage; 
<A NAME="706"></A>but whether his possession of the minor virtues be actual as well as potential, 
<A NAME="707"></A>whether even the greater are in Act in him or yield to qualities higher 
<A NAME="708"></A>still, must be decided afresh in each several case.
<A NAME="709"></A><BR><BR>Take, for example, Contemplative-Wisdom. If other guides of conduct 
<A NAME="710"></A>must be called in to meet a given need, can this virtue hold its ground 
<A NAME="711"></A>even in mere potentiality?
<A NAME="712"></A><BR><BR>And what happens when the virtues in their very nature differ in 
<A NAME="713"></A>scope and province? Where, for example, Sophrosyne would allow certain 
<A NAME="714"></A>acts or emotions under due restraint and another virtue would cut them 
<A NAME="715"></A>off altogether? And is it not clear that all may have to yield, once Contemplative-Wisdom 
<A NAME="716"></A>comes into action?
<A NAME="717"></A><BR><BR>The solution is in understanding the virtues and what each has 
<A NAME="718"></A>to give: thus the man will learn to work with this or that as every several 
<A NAME="719"></A>need demands. And as he reaches to loftier principles and other standards 
<A NAME="720"></A>these in turn will define his conduct: for example, Restraint in its earlier 
<A NAME="721"></A>form will no longer satisfy him; he will work for the final Disengagement; 
<A NAME="722"></A>he will live, no longer, the human life of the good man- such as Civic 
<A NAME="723"></A>Virtue commends- but, leaving this beneath him, will take up instead another 
<A NAME="724"></A>life, that of the Gods.
<A NAME="725"></A><BR><BR>For it is to the Gods, not to the Good, that our Likeness must 
<A NAME="726"></A>look: to model ourselves upon good men is to produce an image of an image: 
<A NAME="727"></A>we have to fix our gaze above the image and attain Likeness to the Supreme 
<A NAME="728"></A>Exemplar.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="729"></A><B>Third Tractate</B>

<A NAME="730"></A><BR><BR><B>ON DIALECTIC [THE UPWARD WAY].</B>
<A NAME="731"></A><BR><BR><B>1.</B> What art is there, what method, what discipline to bring 
<A NAME="732"></A>us there where we must go?
<A NAME="733"></A><BR><BR>The Term at which we must arrive we may take as agreed: we have 
<A NAME="734"></A>established elsewhere, by many considerations, that our journey is to the 
<A NAME="735"></A>Good, to the Primal-Principle; and, indeed, the very reasoning which discovered 
<A NAME="736"></A>the Term was itself something like an initiation.
<A NAME="737"></A><BR><BR>But what order of beings will attain the Term?
<A NAME="738"></A><BR>Surely, as we read, those that have already seen all or most things, 
<A NAME="739"></A>those who at their first birth have entered into the life-germ from which 
<A NAME="740"></A>is to spring a metaphysician, a musician or a born lover, the metaphysician 
<A NAME="741"></A>taking to the path by instinct, the musician and the nature peculiarly 
<A NAME="742"></A>susceptible to love needing outside guidance.
<A NAME="743"></A><BR><BR>But how lies the course? Is it alike for all, or is there a distinct 
<A NAME="744"></A>method for each class of temperament?
<A NAME="745"></A><BR><BR>For all there are two stages of the path, as they are making upwards 
<A NAME="746"></A>or have already gained the upper sphere.
<A NAME="747"></A><BR><BR>The first degree is the conversion from the lower life; the second- 
<A NAME="748"></A>held by those that have already made their way to the sphere of the Intelligibles, 
<A NAME="749"></A>have set as it were a footprint there but must still advance within the 
<A NAME="750"></A>realm- lasts until they reach the extreme hold of the place, the Term attained 
<A NAME="751"></A>when the topmost peak of the Intellectual realm is won.
<A NAME="752"></A><BR><BR>But this highest degree must bide its time: let us first try to 
<A NAME="753"></A>speak of the initial process of conversion.
<A NAME="754"></A><BR><BR>We must begin by distinguishing the three types. Let us take the 
<A NAME="755"></A>musician first and indicate his temperamental equipment for the 
<A NAME="756"></A>task.
<A NAME="757"></A><BR><BR>The musician we may think of as being exceedingly quick to beauty, 
<A NAME="758"></A>drawn in a very rapture to it: somewhat slow to stir of his own impulse, 
<A NAME="759"></A>he answers at once to the outer stimulus: as the timid are sensitive to 
<A NAME="760"></A>noise so he to tones and the beauty they convey; all that offends against 
<A NAME="761"></A>unison or harmony in melodies and rhythms repels him; he longs for measure 
<A NAME="762"></A>and shapely pattern.
<A NAME="763"></A><BR><BR>This natural tendency must be made the starting-point to such a 
<A NAME="764"></A>man; he must be drawn by the tone, rhythm and design in things of sense: 
<A NAME="765"></A>he must learn to distinguish the material forms from the Authentic-Existent 
<A NAME="766"></A>which is the source of all these correspondences and of the entire reasoned 
<A NAME="767"></A>scheme in the work of art: he must be led to the Beauty that manifests 
<A NAME="768"></A>itself through these forms; he must be shown that what ravished him was 
<A NAME="769"></A>no other than the Harmony of the Intellectual world and the Beauty in that 
<A NAME="770"></A>sphere, not some one shape of beauty but the All-Beauty, the Absolute Beauty; 
<A NAME="771"></A>and the truths of philosophy must be implanted in him to lead him to faith 
<A NAME="772"></A>in that which, unknowing it, he possesses within himself. What these truths 
<A NAME="773"></A>are we will show later.
<A NAME="774"></A><BR><BR><B>2.</B> The born lover, to whose degree the musician also may 
<A NAME="775"></A>attain- and then either come to a stand or pass beyond- has a certain memory 
<A NAME="776"></A>of beauty but, severed from it now, he no longer comprehends it: spellbound 
<A NAME="777"></A>by visible loveliness he clings amazed about that. His lesson must be to 
<A NAME="778"></A>fall down no longer in bewildered delight before some, one embodied form; 
<A NAME="779"></A>he must be led, under a system of mental discipline, to beauty everywhere 
<A NAME="780"></A>and made to discern the One Principle underlying all, a Principle apart 
<A NAME="781"></A>from the material forms, springing from another source, and elsewhere more 
<A NAME="782"></A>truly present. The beauty, for example, in a noble course of life and in 
<A NAME="783"></A>an admirably organized social system may be pointed out to him- a first 
<A NAME="784"></A>training this in the loveliness of the immaterial- he must learn to recognise 
<A NAME="785"></A>the beauty in the arts, sciences, virtues; then these severed and particular 
<A NAME="786"></A>forms must be brought under the one principle by the explanation of their 
<A NAME="787"></A>origin. From the virtues he is to be led to the Intellectual-Principle, 
<A NAME="788"></A>to the Authentic-Existent; thence onward, he treads the upward 
<A NAME="789"></A>way.
<A NAME="790"></A><BR><BR><B>3.</B> The metaphysician, equipped by that very character, winged 
<A NAME="791"></A>already and not like those others, in need of disengagement, stirring of 
<A NAME="792"></A>himself towards the supernal but doubting of the way, needs only a guide. 
<A NAME="793"></A>He must be shown, then, and instructed, a willing wayfarer by his very 
<A NAME="794"></A>temperament, all but self-directed.
<A NAME="795"></A><BR><BR>Mathematics, which as a student by nature he will take very easily, 
<A NAME="796"></A>will be prescribed to train him to abstract thought and to faith in the 
<A NAME="797"></A>unembodied; a moral being by native disposition, he must be led to make 
<A NAME="798"></A>his virtue perfect; after the Mathematics he must be put through a course 
<A NAME="799"></A>in Dialectic and made an adept in the science.
<A NAME="800"></A><BR><BR><B>4.</B> But this science, this Dialectic essential to all the 
<A NAME="801"></A>three classes alike, what, in sum, is it?
<A NAME="802"></A><BR><BR>It is the Method, or Discipline, that brings with it the power 
<A NAME="803"></A>of pronouncing with final truth upon the nature and relation of things- 
<A NAME="804"></A>what each is, how it differs from others, what common quality all have, 
<A NAME="805"></A>to what Kind each belongs and in what rank each stands in its Kind and 
<A NAME="806"></A>whether its Being is Real-Being, and how many Beings there are, and how 
<A NAME="807"></A>many non-Beings to be distinguished from Beings.
<A NAME="808"></A><BR><BR>Dialectic treats also of the Good and the not-Good, and of the 
<A NAME="809"></A>particulars that fall under each, and of what is the Eternal and what the 
<A NAME="810"></A>not Eternal- and of these, it must be understood, not by seeming-knowledge 
<A NAME="811"></A>["sense-knowledge"] but with authentic science.
<A NAME="812"></A><BR><BR>All this accomplished, it gives up its touring of the realm of 
<A NAME="813"></A>sense and settles down in the Intellectual Kosmos and there plies its own 
<A NAME="814"></A>peculiar Act: it has abandoned all the realm of deceit and falsity, and 
<A NAME="815"></A>pastures the Soul in the "Meadows of Truth": it employs the Platonic division 
<A NAME="816"></A>to the discernment of the Ideal-Forms, of the Authentic-Existence and of 
<A NAME="817"></A>the First-Kinds [or Categories of Being]: it establishes, in the light 
<A NAME="818"></A>of Intellection, the unity there is in all that issues from these Firsts, 
<A NAME="819"></A>until it has traversed the entire Intellectual Realm: then, resolving the 
<A NAME="820"></A>unity into the particulars once more, it returns to the point from which 
<A NAME="821"></A>it starts.
<A NAME="822"></A><BR><BR>Now rests: instructed and satisfied as to the Being in that sphere, 
<A NAME="823"></A>it is no longer busy about many things: it has arrived at Unity and it 
<A NAME="824"></A>contemplates: it leaves to another science all that coil of premisses and 
<A NAME="825"></A>conclusions called the art of reasoning, much as it leaves the art of writing: 
<A NAME="826"></A>some of the matter of logic, no doubt, it considers necessary- to clear 
<A NAME="827"></A>the ground- but it makes itself the judge, here as in everything else; 
<A NAME="828"></A>where it sees use, it uses; anything it finds superfluous, it leaves to 
<A NAME="829"></A>whatever department of learning or practice may turn that matter to 
<A NAME="830"></A>account.
<A NAME="831"></A><BR><BR><B>5.</B> But whence does this science derive its own initial 
<A NAME="832"></A>laws?
<A NAME="833"></A><BR>The Intellectual-Principle furnishes standards, the most certain for 
<A NAME="834"></A>any soul that is able to apply them. What else is necessary, Dialectic 
<A NAME="835"></A>puts together for itself, combining and dividing, until it has reached 
<A NAME="836"></A>perfect Intellection. "For," we read, "it is the purest [perfection] of 
<A NAME="837"></A>Intellection and Contemplative-Wisdom." And, being the noblest method and 
<A NAME="838"></A>science that exists it must needs deal with Authentic-Existence, The Highest 
<A NAME="839"></A>there is: as Contemplative-Wisdom [or true-knowing] it deals with Being, 
<A NAME="840"></A>as Intellection with what transcends Being.
<A NAME="841"></A><BR><BR>What, then, is Philosophy?
<A NAME="842"></A><BR>Philosophy is the supremely precious.
<A NAME="843"></A><BR>Is Dialectic, then, the same as Philosophy?
<A NAME="844"></A><BR>It is the precious part of Philosophy. We must not think of it as the 
<A NAME="845"></A>mere tool of the metaphysician: Dialectic does not consist of bare theories 
<A NAME="846"></A>and rules: it deals with verities; Existences are, as it were, Matter to 
<A NAME="847"></A>it, or at least it proceeds methodically towards Existences, and possesses 
<A NAME="848"></A>itself, at the one step, of the notions and of the realities.
<A NAME="849"></A><BR><BR>Untruth and sophism it knows, not directly, not of its own nature, 
<A NAME="850"></A>but merely as something produced outside itself, something which it recognises 
<A NAME="851"></A>to be foreign to the verities laid up in itself; in the falsity presented 
<A NAME="852"></A>to it, it perceives a clash with its own canon of truth. Dialectic, that 
<A NAME="853"></A>is to say, has no knowledge of propositions- collections of words- but 
<A NAME="854"></A>it knows the truth, and, in that knowledge, knows what the schools call 
<A NAME="855"></A>their propositions: it knows above all, the operation of the soul, and, 
<A NAME="856"></A>by virtue of this knowing, it knows, too, what is affirmed and what is 
<A NAME="857"></A>denied, whether the denial is of what was asserted or of something else, 
<A NAME="858"></A>and whether propositions agree or differ; all that is submitted to it, 
<A NAME="859"></A>it attacks with the directness of sense-perception and it leaves petty 
<A NAME="860"></A>precisions of process to what other science may care for such 
<A NAME="861"></A>exercises.
<A NAME="862"></A><BR><BR><B>6.</B> Philosophy has other provinces, but Dialectic is its 
<A NAME="863"></A>precious part: in its study of the laws of the universe, Philosophy draws 
<A NAME="864"></A>on Dialectic much as other studies and crafts use Arithmetic, though, of 
<A NAME="865"></A>course, the alliance between Philosophy and Dialectic is 
<A NAME="866"></A>closer.
<A NAME="867"></A><BR><BR>And in Morals, too, Philosophy uses Dialectic: by Dialectic it 
<A NAME="868"></A>comes to contemplation, though it originates of itself the moral state 
<A NAME="869"></A>or rather the discipline from which the moral state 
<A NAME="870"></A>develops.
<A NAME="871"></A><BR><BR>Our reasoning faculties employ the data of Dialectic almost as 
<A NAME="872"></A>their proper possession for they are mainly concerned about Matter [whose 
<A NAME="873"></A>place and worth Dialectic establishes].
<A NAME="874"></A><BR><BR>And while the other virtues bring the reason to bear upon particular 
<A NAME="875"></A>experiences and acts, the virtue of Wisdom [i.e., the virtue peculiarly 
<A NAME="876"></A>induced by Dialectic] is a certain super-reasoning much closer to the Universal; 
<A NAME="877"></A>for it deals with correspondence and sequence, the choice of time for action 
<A NAME="878"></A>and inaction, the adoption of this course, the rejection of that other: 
<A NAME="879"></A>Wisdom and Dialectic have the task of presenting all things as Universals 
<A NAME="880"></A>and stripped of matter for treatment by the Understanding.
<A NAME="881"></A><BR><BR>But can these inferior kinds of virtue exist without Dialectic 
<A NAME="882"></A>and philosophy?
<A NAME="883"></A><BR><BR>Yes- but imperfectly, inadequately.
<A NAME="884"></A><BR>And is it possible to be a Sage, Master in Dialectic, without these 
<A NAME="885"></A>lower virtues?
<A NAME="886"></A><BR><BR>It would not happen: the lower will spring either before or together 
<A NAME="887"></A>with the higher. And it is likely that everyone normally possesses the 
<A NAME="888"></A>natural virtues from which, when Wisdom steps in, the perfected virtue 
<A NAME="889"></A>develops. After the natural virtues, then, Wisdom and, so the perfecting 
<A NAME="890"></A>of the moral nature. Once the natural virtues exist, both orders, the natural 
<A NAME="891"></A>and the higher, ripen side by side to their final excellence: or as the 
<A NAME="892"></A>one advances it carries forward the other towards perfection.
<A NAME="893"></A><BR><BR>But, ever, the natural virtue is imperfect in vision and in strength- 
<A NAME="894"></A>and to both orders of virtue the essential matter is from what principles 
<A NAME="895"></A>we derive them.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="896"></A><B>Fourth Tractate</B>

<A NAME="897"></A><BR><BR><B>ON TRUE HAPPINESS.</B>
<A NAME="898"></A><BR><BR><B>1.</B> Are we to make True Happiness one and the same thing 
<A NAME="899"></A>with Welfare or Prosperity and therefore within the reach of the other 
<A NAME="900"></A>living beings as well as ourselves?
<A NAME="901"></A><BR><BR>There is certainly no reason to deny well-being to any of them 
<A NAME="902"></A>as long as their lot allows them to flourish unhindered after their 
<A NAME="903"></A>kind.
<A NAME="904"></A><BR><BR>Whether we make Welfare consist in pleasant conditions of life, 
<A NAME="905"></A>or in the accomplishment of some appropriate task, by either account it 
<A NAME="906"></A>may fall to them as to us. For certainly they may at once be pleasantly 
<A NAME="907"></A>placed and engaged about some function that lies in their nature: take 
<A NAME="908"></A>for an instance such living beings as have the gift of music; finding themselves 
<A NAME="909"></A>well-off in other ways, they sing, too, as their nature is, and so their 
<A NAME="910"></A>day is pleasant to them.
<A NAME="911"></A><BR><BR>And if, even, we set Happiness in some ultimate Term pursued by 
<A NAME="912"></A>inborn tendency, then on this head, too, we must allow it to animals from 
<A NAME="913"></A>the moment of their attaining this Ultimate: the nature in them comes to 
<A NAME="914"></A>a halt, having fulfilled its vital course from a beginning to an 
<A NAME="915"></A>end.
<A NAME="916"></A><BR><BR>It may be a distasteful notion, this bringing-down of happiness 
<A NAME="917"></A>so low as to the animal world- making it over, as then we must, even to 
<A NAME="918"></A>the vilest of them and not withholding it even from the plants, living 
<A NAME="919"></A>they too and having a life unfolding to a Term.
<A NAME="920"></A><BR><BR>But, to begin with, it is surely unsound to deny that good of life 
<A NAME="921"></A>to animals only because they do not appear to man to be of great account. 
<A NAME="922"></A>And as for plants, we need not necessarily allow to them what we accord 
<A NAME="923"></A>to the other forms of life, since they have no feeling. It is true people 
<A NAME="924"></A>might be found to declare prosperity possible to the very plants: they 
<A NAME="925"></A>have life, and life may bring good or evil; the plants may thrive or wither, 
<A NAME="926"></A>bear or be barren.
<A NAME="927"></A><BR><BR>No: if Pleasure be the Term, if here be the good of life, it is 
<A NAME="928"></A>impossible to deny the good of life to any order of living things; if the 
<A NAME="929"></A>Term be inner-peace, equally impossible; impossible, too, if the good of 
<A NAME="930"></A>life be to live in accordance with the purpose of nature.
<A NAME="931"></A><BR><BR><B>2.</B> Those that deny the happy life to the plants on the ground 
<A NAME="932"></A>that they lack sensation are really denying it to all living 
<A NAME="933"></A>things.
<A NAME="934"></A><BR><BR>By sensation can be meant only perception of state, and the state 
<A NAME="935"></A>of well-being must be Good in itself quite apart from the perception: to 
<A NAME="936"></A>be a part of the natural plan is good whether knowingly or without knowledge: 
<A NAME="937"></A>there is good in the appropriate state even though there be no recognition 
<A NAME="938"></A>of its fitness or desirable quality- for it must be in itself 
<A NAME="939"></A>desirable.
<A NAME="940"></A><BR><BR>This Good exists, then; is present: that in which it is present 
<A NAME="941"></A>has well-being without more ado: what need then to ask for sensation into 
<A NAME="942"></A>the bargain?
<A NAME="943"></A><BR><BR>Perhaps, however, the theory is that the good of any state consists 
<A NAME="944"></A>not in the condition itself but in the knowledge and perception of 
<A NAME="945"></A>it.
<A NAME="946"></A><BR><BR>But at this rate the Good is nothing but the mere sensation, the 
<A NAME="947"></A>bare activity of the sentient life. And so it will be possessed by all 
<A NAME="948"></A>that feel, no matter what. Perhaps it will be said that two constituents 
<A NAME="949"></A>are needed to make up the Good, that there must be both feeling and a given 
<A NAME="950"></A>state felt: but how can it be maintained that the bringing together of 
<A NAME="951"></A>two neutrals can produce the Good?
<A NAME="952"></A><BR><BR>They will explain, possibly, that the state must be a state of 
<A NAME="953"></A>Good and that such a condition constitutes well-being on the discernment 
<A NAME="954"></A>of that present good; but then they invite the question whether the well-being 
<A NAME="955"></A>comes by discerning the presence of the Good that is there, or whether 
<A NAME="956"></A>there must further be the double recognition that the state is agreeable 
<A NAME="957"></A>and that the agreeable state constitutes the Good.
<A NAME="958"></A><BR><BR>If well-being demands this recognition, it depends no longer upon 
<A NAME="959"></A>sensation but upon another, a higher faculty; and well-being is vested 
<A NAME="960"></A>not in a faculty receptive of pleasure but in one competent to discern 
<A NAME="961"></A>that pleasure is the Good.
<A NAME="962"></A><BR><BR>Then the cause of the well-being is no longer pleasure but the 
<A NAME="963"></A>faculty competent to pronounce as to pleasure's value. Now a judging entity 
<A NAME="964"></A>is nobler than one that merely accepts a state: it is a principle of Reason 
<A NAME="965"></A>or of Intellection: pleasure is a state: the reasonless can never be closer 
<A NAME="966"></A>to the Good than reason is. How can reason abdicate and declare nearer 
<A NAME="967"></A>to good than itself something lying in a contrary order?
<A NAME="968"></A><BR><BR>No: those denying the good of life to the vegetable world, and 
<A NAME="969"></A>those that make it consist in some precise quality of sensation, are in 
<A NAME="970"></A>reality seeking a loftier well-being than they are aware of, and setting 
<A NAME="971"></A>their highest in a more luminous phase of life.
<A NAME="972"></A><BR><BR>Perhaps, then, those are in the right who found happiness not on 
<A NAME="973"></A>the bare living or even on sensitive life but on the life of 
<A NAME="974"></A>Reason?
<A NAME="975"></A><BR><BR>But they must tell us it should be thus restricted and why precisely 
<A NAME="976"></A>they make Reason an essential to the happiness in a living 
<A NAME="977"></A>being:
<A NAME="978"></A><BR><BR>"When you insist on Reason, is it because Reason is resourceful, 
<A NAME="979"></A>swift to discern and compass the primal needs of nature; or would you demand 
<A NAME="980"></A>it, even though it were powerless in that domain?"
<A NAME="981"></A><BR><BR>If you call it in as a provider, then the reasonless, equally with 
<A NAME="982"></A>the reasoning, may possess happiness after their kind, as long as, without 
<A NAME="983"></A>any thought of theirs, nature supplies their wants: Reason becomes a servant; 
<A NAME="984"></A>there is no longer any worth in it for itself and no worth in that consummation 
<A NAME="985"></A>of reason which, we hold, is virtue.
<A NAME="986"></A><BR><BR>If you say that reason is to be cherished for its own sake and 
<A NAME="987"></A>not as supplying these human needs, you must tell us what other services 
<A NAME="988"></A>it renders, what is its proper nature and what makes it the perfect thing 
<A NAME="989"></A>it is.
<A NAME="990"></A><BR><BR>For, on this admission, its perfection cannot reside in any such 
<A NAME="991"></A>planning and providing: its perfection will be something quite different, 
<A NAME="992"></A>something of quite another class: Reason cannot be itself one of those 
<A NAME="993"></A>first needs of nature; it cannot even be a cause of those first needs of 
<A NAME="994"></A>nature or at all belong to that order: it must be nobler than any and all 
<A NAME="995"></A>of such things: otherwise it is not easy to see how we can be asked to 
<A NAME="996"></A>rate it so highly.
<A NAME="997"></A><BR><BR>Until these people light upon some nobler principle than any at 
<A NAME="998"></A>which they still halt, they must be left where they are and where they 
<A NAME="999"></A>choose to be, never understanding what the Good of Life is to those that 
<A NAME="1000"></A>can make it theirs, never knowing to what kind of beings it is 
<A NAME="1001"></A>accessible.
<A NAME="1002"></A><BR><BR>What then is happiness? Let us try basing it upon 
<A NAME="1003"></A>Life.
<A NAME="1004"></A><BR><B>3.</B> Now if we draw no distinction as to kinds of life, everything 
<A NAME="1005"></A>that lives will be capable of happiness, and those will be effectively 
<A NAME="1006"></A>happy who possess that one common gift of which every living thing is by 
<A NAME="1007"></A>nature receptive. We could not deny it to the irrational whilst allowing 
<A NAME="1008"></A>it to the rational. If happiness were inherent in the bare being-alive, 
<A NAME="1009"></A>the common ground in which the cause of happiness could always take root 
<A NAME="1010"></A>would be simply life.
<A NAME="1011"></A><BR><BR>Those, then, that set happiness not in the mere living but in the 
<A NAME="1012"></A>reasoning life seem to overlook the fact that they are not really making 
<A NAME="1013"></A>it depend upon life at all: they admit that this reasoning faculty, round 
<A NAME="1014"></A>which they centre happiness, is a property [not the subject of a property]: 
<A NAME="1015"></A>the subject, to them, must be the Reasoning-Life since it is in this double 
<A NAME="1016"></A>term that they find the basis of the happiness: so that they are making 
<A NAME="1017"></A>it consist not in life but in a particular kind of life- not, of course, 
<A NAME="1018"></A>a species formally opposite but, in terminology, standing as an "earlier" 
<A NAME="1019"></A>to a "later" in the one Kind.
<A NAME="1020"></A><BR><BR>Now in common use this word "Life" embraces many forms which shade 
<A NAME="1021"></A>down from primal to secondary and so on, all massed under the common term- 
<A NAME="1022"></A>life of plant and life of animal- each phase brighter or dimmer than its 
<A NAME="1023"></A>next: and so it evidently must be with the Good-of-Life. And if thing is 
<A NAME="1024"></A>ever the image of thing, so every Good must always be the image of a higher 
<A NAME="1025"></A>Good.
<A NAME="1026"></A><BR><BR>If mere Being is insufficient, if happiness demands fulness of 
<A NAME="1027"></A>life, and exists, therefore, where nothing is lacking of all that belongs 
<A NAME="1028"></A>to the idea of life, then happiness can exist only in a being that lives 
<A NAME="1029"></A>fully.
<A NAME="1030"></A><BR><BR>And such a one will possess not merely the good, but the Supreme 
<A NAME="1031"></A>Good if, that is to say, in the realm of existents the Supreme Good can 
<A NAME="1032"></A>be no other than the authentically living, no other than Life in its greatest 
<A NAME="1033"></A>plenitude, life in which the good is present as something essential not 
<A NAME="1034"></A>as something brought from without, a life needing no foreign substance 
<A NAME="1035"></A>called in from a foreign realm, to establish it in good.
<A NAME="1036"></A><BR><BR>For what could be added to the fullest life to make it the best 
<A NAME="1037"></A>life? If anyone should answer, "The nature of Good" [The Good, as a Divine 
<A NAME="1038"></A>Hypostasis], the reply would certainly be near our thought, but we are 
<A NAME="1039"></A>not seeking the Cause but the main constituent.
<A NAME="1040"></A><BR><BR>It has been said more than once that the perfect life and the true 
<A NAME="1041"></A>life, the essential life, is in the Intellectual Nature beyond this sphere, 
<A NAME="1042"></A>and that all other forms of life are incomplete, are phantoms of life, 
<A NAME="1043"></A>imperfect, not pure, not more truly life than they are its contrary: here 
<A NAME="1044"></A>let it be said succinctly that since all living things proceed from the 
<A NAME="1045"></A>one principle but possess life in different degrees, this principle must 
<A NAME="1046"></A>be the first life and the most complete.
<A NAME="1047"></A><BR><BR><B>4.</B> If, then, the perfect life is within human reach, the 
<A NAME="1048"></A>man attaining it attains happiness: if not, happiness must be made over 
<A NAME="1049"></A>to the gods, for the perfect life is for them alone.
<A NAME="1050"></A><BR><BR>But since we hold that happiness is for human beings too, we must 
<A NAME="1051"></A>consider what this perfect life is. The matter may be stated 
<A NAME="1052"></A>thus:
<A NAME="1053"></A><BR><BR>It has been shown elsewhere that man, when he commands not merely 
<A NAME="1054"></A>the life of sensation but also Reason and Authentic Intellection, has realised 
<A NAME="1055"></A>the perfect life.
<A NAME="1056"></A><BR><BR>But are we to picture this kind of life as something foreign imported 
<A NAME="1057"></A>into his nature?
<A NAME="1058"></A><BR><BR>No: there exists no single human being that does not either potentially 
<A NAME="1059"></A>or effectively possess this thing which we hold to constitute 
<A NAME="1060"></A>happiness.
<A NAME="1061"></A><BR><BR>But are we to think of man as including this form of life, the 
<A NAME="1062"></A>perfect, after the manner of a partial constituent of his entire 
<A NAME="1063"></A>nature?
<A NAME="1064"></A><BR><BR>We say, rather, that while in some men it is present as a mere 
<A NAME="1065"></A>portion of their total being- in those, namely, that have it potentially- 
<A NAME="1066"></A>there is, too, the man, already in possession of true felicity, who is 
<A NAME="1067"></A>this perfection realized, who has passed over into actual identification 
<A NAME="1068"></A>with it. All else is now mere clothing about the man, not to be called 
<A NAME="1069"></A>part of him since it lies about him unsought, not his because not appropriated 
<A NAME="1070"></A>to himself by any act of the will.
<A NAME="1071"></A><BR><BR>To the man in this state, what is the Good?
<A NAME="1072"></A><BR>He himself by what he has and is.
<A NAME="1073"></A><BR>And the author and principle of what he is and holds is the Supreme, 
<A NAME="1074"></A>which within Itself is the Good but manifests Itself within the human being 
<A NAME="1075"></A>after this other mode.
<A NAME="1076"></A><BR><BR>The sign that this state has been achieved is that the man seeks 
<A NAME="1077"></A>nothing else.
<A NAME="1078"></A><BR><BR>What indeed could he be seeking? Certainly none of the less worthy 
<A NAME="1079"></A>things; and the Best he carries always within him.
<A NAME="1080"></A><BR><BR>He that has such a life as this has all he needs in 
<A NAME="1081"></A>life.
<A NAME="1082"></A><BR>Once the man is a Sage, the means of happiness, the way to good, are 
<A NAME="1083"></A>within, for nothing is good that lies outside him. Anything he desires 
<A NAME="1084"></A>further than this he seeks as a necessity, and not for himself but for 
<A NAME="1085"></A>a subordinate, for the body bound to him, to which since it has life he 
<A NAME="1086"></A>must minister the needs of life, not needs, however, to the true man of 
<A NAME="1087"></A>this degree. He knows himself to stand above all such things, and what 
<A NAME="1088"></A>he gives to the lower he so gives as to leave his true life 
<A NAME="1089"></A>undiminished.
<A NAME="1090"></A><BR><BR>Adverse fortune does not shake his felicity: the life so founded 
<A NAME="1091"></A>is stable ever. Suppose death strikes at his household or at his friends; 
<A NAME="1092"></A>he knows what death is, as the victims, if they are among the wise, know 
<A NAME="1093"></A>too. And if death taking from him his familiars and intimates does bring 
<A NAME="1094"></A>grief, it is not to him, not to the true man, but to that in him which 
<A NAME="1095"></A>stands apart from the Supreme, to that lower man in whose distress he takes 
<A NAME="1096"></A>no part.
<A NAME="1097"></A><BR><BR><B>5.</B> But what of sorrows, illnesses and all else that inhibit 
<A NAME="1098"></A>the native activity?
<A NAME="1099"></A><BR><BR>What of the suspension of consciousness which drugs or disease 
<A NAME="1100"></A>may bring about? Could either welfare or happiness be present under such 
<A NAME="1101"></A>conditions? And this is to say nothing of misery and disgrace, which will 
<A NAME="1102"></A>certainly be urged against us, with undoubtedly also those never-failing 
<A NAME="1103"></A>"Miseries of Priam."
<A NAME="1104"></A><BR><BR>"The Sage," we shall be told, "may bear such afflictions and even 
<A NAME="1105"></A>take them lightly but they could never be his choice, and the happy life 
<A NAME="1106"></A>must be one that would be chosen. The Sage, that is, cannot be thought 
<A NAME="1107"></A>of as simply a sage soul, no count being taken of the bodily-principle 
<A NAME="1108"></A>in the total of the being: he will, no doubt, take all bravely... until 
<A NAME="1109"></A>the body's appeals come up before him, and longings and loathings penetrate 
<A NAME="1110"></A>through the body to the inner man. And since pleasure must be counted in 
<A NAME="1111"></A>towards the happy life, how can one that, thus, knows the misery of ill-fortune 
<A NAME="1112"></A>or pain be happy, however sage he be? Such a state, of bliss self-contained, 
<A NAME="1113"></A>is for the Gods; men, because of the less noble part subjoined in them, 
<A NAME="1114"></A>must needs seek happiness throughout all their being and not merely in 
<A NAME="1115"></A>some one part; if the one constituent be troubled, the other, answering 
<A NAME="1116"></A>to its associate's distress, must perforce suffer hindrance in its own 
<A NAME="1117"></A>activity. There is nothing but to cut away the body or the body's sensitive 
<A NAME="1118"></A>life and so secure that self-contained unity essential to 
<A NAME="1119"></A>happiness."
<A NAME="1120"></A><BR><BR><B>6.</B> Now if happiness did indeed require freedom from pain, 
<A NAME="1121"></A>sickness, misfortune, disaster, it would be utterly denied to anyone confronted 
<A NAME="1122"></A>by such trials: but if it lies in the fruition of the Authentic Good, why 
<A NAME="1123"></A>turn away from this Term and look to means, imagining that to be happy 
<A NAME="1124"></A>a man must need a variety of things none of which enter into happiness? 
<A NAME="1125"></A>If, in fact, felicity were made up by heaping together all that is at once 
<A NAME="1126"></A>desirable and necessary we must bid for these also. But if the Term must 
<A NAME="1127"></A>be one and not many; if in other words our quest is of a Term and not of 
<A NAME="1128"></A>Terms; that only can be elected which is ultimate and noblest, that which 
<A NAME="1129"></A>calls to the tenderest longings of the soul.
<A NAME="1130"></A><BR><BR>The quest and will of the Soul are not pointed directly towards 
<A NAME="1131"></A>freedom from this sphere: the reason which disciplines away our concern 
<A NAME="1132"></A>about this life has no fundamental quarrel with things of this order; it 
<A NAME="1133"></A>merely resents their interference; sometimes, even, it must seek them; 
<A NAME="1134"></A>essentially all the aspiration is not so much away from evil as towards 
<A NAME="1135"></A>the Soul's own highest and noblest: this attained, all is won and there 
<A NAME="1136"></A>is rest- and this is the veritably willed state of life.
<A NAME="1137"></A><BR><BR>There can be no such thing as "willing" the acquirement of necessaries, 
<A NAME="1138"></A>if Will is to be taken in its strict sense, and not misapplied to the mere 
<A NAME="1139"></A>recognition of need.
<A NAME="1140"></A><BR><BR>It is certain that we shrink from the unpleasant, and such shrinking 
<A NAME="1141"></A>is assuredly not what we should have willed; to have no occasion for any 
<A NAME="1142"></A>such shrinking would be much nearer to our taste; but the things we seek 
<A NAME="1143"></A>tell the story as soon as they are ours. For instance, health and freedom 
<A NAME="1144"></A>from pain; which of these has any great charm? As long as we possess them, 
<A NAME="1145"></A>we set no store upon them.
<A NAME="1146"></A><BR><BR>Anything which, present, has no charm and adds nothing to happiness, 
<A NAME="1147"></A>which when lacking is desired because of the presence of an annoying opposite, 
<A NAME="1148"></A>may reasonably be called a necessity but not a Good.
<A NAME="1149"></A><BR><BR>Such things can never make part of our final object: our Term must 
<A NAME="1150"></A>be such that though these pleasanter conditions be absent and their contraries 
<A NAME="1151"></A>present, it shall remain, still, intact.
<A NAME="1152"></A><BR><BR><B>7.</B> Then why are these conditions sought and their contraries 
<A NAME="1153"></A>repelled by the man established in happiness?
<A NAME="1154"></A><BR><BR>Here is our answer:
<A NAME="1155"></A><BR>These more pleasant conditions cannot, it is true, add any particle 
<A NAME="1156"></A>towards the Sage's felicity: but they do serve towards the integrity of 
<A NAME="1157"></A>his being, while the presence of the contraries tends against his Being 
<A NAME="1158"></A>or complicates the Term: it is not that the Sage can be so easily deprived 
<A NAME="1159"></A>of the Term achieved but simply that he that holds the highest good desires 
<A NAME="1160"></A>to have that alone, not something else at the same time, something which, 
<A NAME="1161"></A>though it cannot banish the Good by its incoming, does yet take place by 
<A NAME="1162"></A>its side.
<A NAME="1163"></A><BR><BR>In any case if the man that has attained felicity meets some turn 
<A NAME="1164"></A>of fortune that he would not have chosen, there is not the slightest lessening 
<A NAME="1165"></A>of his happiness for that. If there were, his felicity would be veering 
<A NAME="1166"></A>or falling from day to day; the death of a child would bring him down, 
<A NAME="1167"></A>or the loss of some trivial possession. No: a thousand mischances and disappointments 
<A NAME="1168"></A>may befall him and leave him still in the tranquil possession of the 
<A NAME="1169"></A>Term.
<A NAME="1170"></A><BR><BR>But, they cry, great disasters, not the petty daily 
<A NAME="1171"></A>chances!
<A NAME="1172"></A><BR>What human thing, then, is great, so as not to be despised by one who 
<A NAME="1173"></A>has mounted above all we know here, and is bound now no longer to anything 
<A NAME="1174"></A>below?
<A NAME="1175"></A><BR><BR>If the Sage thinks all fortunate events, however momentous, to 
<A NAME="1176"></A>be no great matter- kingdom and the rule over cities and peoples, colonisations 
<A NAME="1177"></A>and the founding of states, even though all be his own handiwork- how can 
<A NAME="1178"></A>he take any great account of the vacillations of power or the ruin of his 
<A NAME="1179"></A>fatherland? Certainly if he thought any such event a great disaster, or 
<A NAME="1180"></A>any disaster at all, he must be of a very strange way of thinking. One 
<A NAME="1181"></A>that sets great store by wood and stones, or... Zeus... by mortality among 
<A NAME="1182"></A>mortals cannot yet be the Sage, whose estimate of death, we hold, must 
<A NAME="1183"></A>be that it is better than life in the body.
<A NAME="1184"></A><BR><BR>But suppose that he himself is offered a victim in 
<A NAME="1185"></A>sacrifice?
<A NAME="1186"></A><BR>Can he think it an evil to die beside the altars?
<A NAME="1187"></A><BR>But if he go unburied?
<A NAME="1188"></A><BR>Wheresoever it lie, under earth or over earth, his body will always 
<A NAME="1189"></A>rot.
<A NAME="1190"></A><BR><BR>But if he has been hidden away, not with costly ceremony but in 
<A NAME="1191"></A>an unnamed grave, not counted worthy of a towering monument?
<A NAME="1192"></A><BR><BR>The littleness of it!
<A NAME="1193"></A><BR>But if he falls into his enemies' hands, into prison?
<A NAME="1194"></A><BR>There is always the way towards escape, if none towards 
<A NAME="1195"></A>well-being.
<A NAME="1196"></A><BR><BR>But if his nearest be taken from him, his sons and daughters dragged
