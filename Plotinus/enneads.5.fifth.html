<A NAME="10"></A><B>First Tractate</B>
<A NAME="11"></A><BR><BR><B>THE THREE INITIAL HYPOSTASES.</B>
<A NAME="12"></A><BR><BR><B>1.</B> What can it be that has brought the souls to forget the 
<A NAME="13"></A>father, God, and, though members of the Divine and entirely of that world, 
<A NAME="14"></A>to ignore at once themselves and It?
<A NAME="15"></A><BR><BR>The evil that has overtaken them has its source in self-will, in 
<A NAME="16"></A>the entry into the sphere of process, and in the primal differentiation 
<A NAME="17"></A>with the desire for self ownership. They conceived a pleasure in this freedom 
<A NAME="18"></A>and largely indulged their own motion; thus they were hurried down the 
<A NAME="19"></A>wrong path, and in the end, drifting further and further, they came to 
<A NAME="20"></A>lose even the thought of their origin in the Divine. A child wrenched young 
<A NAME="21"></A>from home and brought up during many years at a distance will fail in knowledge 
<A NAME="22"></A>of its father and of itself: the souls, in the same way, no longer discern 
<A NAME="23"></A>either the divinity or their own nature; ignorance of their rank brings 
<A NAME="24"></A>self-depreciation; they misplace their respect, honouring everything more 
<A NAME="25"></A>than themselves; all their awe and admiration is for the alien, and, clinging 
<A NAME="26"></A>to this, they have broken apart, as far as a soul may, and they make light 
<A NAME="27"></A>of what they have deserted; their regard for the mundane and their disregard 
<A NAME="28"></A>of themselves bring about their utter ignoring of the 
<A NAME="29"></A>divine.
<A NAME="30"></A><BR><BR>Admiring pursuit of the external is a confession of inferiority; 
<A NAME="31"></A>and nothing thus holding itself inferior to things that rise and perish, 
<A NAME="32"></A>nothing counting itself less honourable and less enduring than all else 
<A NAME="33"></A>it admires could ever form any notion of either the nature or the power 
<A NAME="34"></A>of God.
<A NAME="35"></A><BR><BR>A double discipline must be applied if human beings in this pass 
<A NAME="36"></A>are to be reclaimed, and brought back to their origins, lifted once more 
<A NAME="37"></A>towards the Supreme and One and First.
<A NAME="38"></A><BR><BR>There is the method, which we amply exhibit elsewhere, declaring 
<A NAME="39"></A>the dishonour of the objects which the Soul holds here in honour; the second 
<A NAME="40"></A>teaches or recalls to the soul its race and worth; this latter is the leading 
<A NAME="41"></A>truth, and, clearly brought out, is the evidence of the 
<A NAME="42"></A>other.
<A NAME="43"></A><BR><BR>It must occupy us now for it bears closely upon our enquiry to 
<A NAME="44"></A>which it is the natural preliminary: the seeker is soul and it must start 
<A NAME="45"></A>from a true notion of the nature and quality by which soul may undertake 
<A NAME="46"></A>the search; it must study itself in order to learn whether it has the faculty 
<A NAME="47"></A>for the enquiry, the eye for the object proposed, whether in fact we ought 
<A NAME="48"></A>to seek; for if the object is alien the search must be futile, while if 
<A NAME="49"></A>there is relationship the solution of our problem is at once desirable 
<A NAME="50"></A>and possible.
<A NAME="51"></A><BR><BR><B>2.</B> Let every soul recall, then, at the outset the truth 
<A NAME="52"></A>that soul is the author of all living things, that it has breathed the 
<A NAME="53"></A>life into them all, whatever is nourished by earth and sea, all the creatures 
<A NAME="54"></A>of the air, the divine stars in the sky; it is the maker of the sun; itself 
<A NAME="55"></A>formed and ordered this vast heaven and conducts all that rhythmic motion; 
<A NAME="56"></A>and it is a principle distinct from all these to which it gives law and 
<A NAME="57"></A>movement and life, and it must of necessity be more honourable than they, 
<A NAME="58"></A>for they gather or dissolve as soul brings them life or abandons them, 
<A NAME="59"></A>but soul, since it never can abandon itself, is of eternal 
<A NAME="60"></A>being.
<A NAME="61"></A><BR><BR>How life was purveyed to the universe of things and to the separate 
<A NAME="62"></A>beings in it may be thus conceived:
<A NAME="63"></A><BR><BR>That great soul must stand pictured before another soul, one not 
<A NAME="64"></A>mean, a soul that has become worthy to look, emancipate from the lure, 
<A NAME="65"></A>from all that binds its fellows in bewitchment, holding itself in quietude. 
<A NAME="66"></A>Let not merely the enveloping body be at peace, body's turmoil stilled, 
<A NAME="67"></A>but all that lies around, earth at peace, and sea at peace, and air and 
<A NAME="68"></A>the very heavens. Into that heaven, all at rest, let the great soul be 
<A NAME="69"></A>conceived to roll inward at every point, penetrating, permeating, from 
<A NAME="70"></A>all sides pouring in its light. As the rays of the sun throwing their brilliance 
<A NAME="71"></A>upon a lowering cloud make it gleam all gold, so the soul entering the 
<A NAME="72"></A>material expanse of the heavens has given life, has given immortality: 
<A NAME="73"></A>what was abject it has lifted up; and the heavenly system, moved now in 
<A NAME="74"></A>endless motion by the soul that leads it in wisdom, has become a living 
<A NAME="75"></A>and a blessed thing; the soul domiciled within, it takes worth where, before 
<A NAME="76"></A>the soul, it was stark body- clay and water- or, rather, the blankness 
<A NAME="77"></A>of Matter, the absence of Being, and, as an author says, "the execration 
<A NAME="78"></A>of the Gods."
<A NAME="79"></A><BR><BR>The Soul's nature and power will be brought out more clearly, more 
<A NAME="80"></A>brilliantly, if we consider next how it envelops the heavenly system and 
<A NAME="81"></A>guides all to its purposes: for it has bestowed itself upon all that huge 
<A NAME="82"></A>expanse so that every interval, small and great alike, all has been 
<A NAME="83"></A>ensouled.
<A NAME="84"></A><BR><BR>The material body is made up of parts, each holding its own place, 
<A NAME="85"></A>some in mutual opposition and others variously interdependent; the soul 
<A NAME="86"></A>is in no such condition; it is not whittled down so that life tells of 
<A NAME="87"></A>a part of the soul and springs where some such separate portion impinges; 
<A NAME="88"></A>each separate life lives by the soul entire, omnipresent in the likeness 
<A NAME="89"></A>of the engendering father, entire in unity and entire in diffused variety. 
<A NAME="90"></A>By the power of the soul the manifold and diverse heavenly system is a 
<A NAME="91"></A>unit: through soul this universe is a God: and the sun is a God because 
<A NAME="92"></A>it is ensouled; so too the stars: and whatsoever we ourselves may be, it 
<A NAME="93"></A>is all in virtue of soul; for "dead is viler than dung."
<A NAME="94"></A><BR><BR>This, by which the gods are divine, must be the oldest God of them 
<A NAME="95"></A>all: and our own soul is of that same Ideal nature, so that to consider 
<A NAME="96"></A>it, purified, freed from all accruement, is to recognise in ourselves that 
<A NAME="97"></A>same value which we have found soul to be, honourable above all that is 
<A NAME="98"></A>bodily. For what is body but earth, and, taking fire itself, what [but 
<A NAME="99"></A>soul] is its burning power? So it is with all the compounds of earth and 
<A NAME="100"></A>fire, even with water and air added to them?
<A NAME="101"></A><BR><BR>If, then, it is the presence of soul that brings worth, how can 
<A NAME="102"></A>a man slight himself and run after other things? You honour the Soul elsewhere; 
<A NAME="103"></A>honour then yourself.
<A NAME="104"></A><BR><BR><B>3.</B> The Soul once seen to be thus precious, thus divine, 
<A NAME="105"></A>you may hold the faith that by its possession you are already nearing God: 
<A NAME="106"></A>in the strength of this power make upwards towards Him: at no great distance 
<A NAME="107"></A>you must attain: there is not much between.
<A NAME="108"></A><BR><BR>But over this divine, there is still a diviner: grasp the upward 
<A NAME="109"></A>neighbour of the soul, its prior and source.
<A NAME="110"></A><BR><BR>Soul, for all the worth we have shown to belong to it, is yet a 
<A NAME="111"></A>secondary, an image of the Intellectual-Principle: reason uttered is an 
<A NAME="112"></A>image of the reason stored within the soul, and in the same way soul is 
<A NAME="113"></A>an utterance of the Intellectual-Principle: it is even the total of its 
<A NAME="114"></A>activity, the entire stream of life sent forth by that Principle to the 
<A NAME="115"></A>production of further being; it is the forthgoing heat of a fire which 
<A NAME="116"></A>has also heat essentially inherent. But within the Supreme we must see 
<A NAME="117"></A>energy not as an overflow but in the double aspect of integral inherence 
<A NAME="118"></A>with the establishment of a new being. Sprung, in other words, from the 
<A NAME="119"></A>Intellectual-Principle, Soul is intellective, but with an intellection 
<A NAME="120"></A>operation by the method of reasonings: for its perfecting it must look 
<A NAME="121"></A>to that Divine Mind, which may be thought of as a father watching over 
<A NAME="122"></A>the development of his child born imperfect in comparison with 
<A NAME="123"></A>himself.
<A NAME="124"></A><BR><BR>Thus its substantial existence comes from the Intellectual-Principle; 
<A NAME="125"></A>and the Reason within it becomes Act in virtue of its contemplation of 
<A NAME="126"></A>that prior; for its thought and act are its own intimate possession when 
<A NAME="127"></A>it looks to the Supreme Intelligence; those only are soul-acts which are 
<A NAME="128"></A>of this intellective nature and are determined by its own character; all 
<A NAME="129"></A>that is less noble is foreign [traceable to Matter] and is accidental to 
<A NAME="130"></A>the soul in the course of its peculiar task.
<A NAME="131"></A><BR><BR>In two ways, then, the Intellectual-Principle enhances the divine 
<A NAME="132"></A>quality of the soul, as father and as immanent presence; nothing separates 
<A NAME="133"></A>them but the fact that they are not one and the same, that there is succession, 
<A NAME="134"></A>that over against a recipient there stands the ideal-form received; but 
<A NAME="135"></A>this recipient, Matter to the Supreme Intelligence, is also noble as being 
<A NAME="136"></A>at once informed by divine intellect and uncompounded.
<A NAME="137"></A><BR><BR>What the Intellectual-Principle must be is carried in the single 
<A NAME="138"></A>word that Soul, itself so great, is still inferior.
<A NAME="139"></A><BR><BR><B>4.</B> But there is yet another way to this 
<A NAME="140"></A>knowledge:
<A NAME="141"></A><BR>Admiring the world of sense as we look out upon its vastness and beauty 
<A NAME="142"></A>and the order of its eternal march, thinking of the gods within it, seen 
<A NAME="143"></A>and hidden, and the celestial spirits and all the life of animal and plant, 
<A NAME="144"></A>let us mount to its archetype, to the yet more authentic sphere: there 
<A NAME="145"></A>we are to contemplate all things as members of the Intellectual- eternal 
<A NAME="146"></A>in their own right, vested with a self-springing consciousness and life- 
<A NAME="147"></A>and, presiding over all these, the unsoiled Intelligence and the unapproachable 
<A NAME="148"></A>wisdom.
<A NAME="149"></A><BR><BR>That archetypal world is the true Golden Age, age of Kronos, who 
<A NAME="150"></A>is the Intellectual-Principle as being the offspring or exuberance of God. 
<A NAME="151"></A>For here is contained all that is immortal: nothing here but is Divine 
<A NAME="152"></A>Mind; all is God; this is the place of every soul. Here is rest unbroken: 
<A NAME="153"></A>for how can that seek change, in which all is well; what need that reach 
<A NAME="154"></A>to, which holds all within itself; what increase can that desire, which 
<A NAME="155"></A>stands utterly achieved? All its content, thus, is perfect, that itself 
<A NAME="156"></A>may be perfect throughout, as holding nothing that is less than the divine, 
<A NAME="157"></A>nothing that is less than intellective. Its knowing is not by search but 
<A NAME="158"></A>by possession, its blessedness inherent, not acquired; for all belongs 
<A NAME="159"></A>to it eternally and it holds the authentic Eternity imitated by Time which, 
<A NAME="160"></A>circling round the Soul, makes towards the new thing and passes by the 
<A NAME="161"></A>old. Soul deals with thing after thing- now Socrates; now a horse: always 
<A NAME="162"></A>some one entity from among beings- but the Intellectual-Principle is all 
<A NAME="163"></A>and therefore its entire content is simultaneously present in that identity: 
<A NAME="164"></A>this is pure being in eternal actuality; nowhere is there any future, for 
<A NAME="165"></A>every then is a now; nor is there any past, for nothing there has ever 
<A NAME="166"></A>ceased to be; everything has taken its stand for ever, an identity well 
<A NAME="167"></A>pleased, we might say, to be as it is; and everything, in that entire content, 
<A NAME="168"></A>is Intellectual-Principle and Authentic Existence; and the total of all 
<A NAME="169"></A>is Intellectual-Principle entire and Being entire. Intellectual-Principle 
<A NAME="170"></A>by its intellective act establishes Being, which in turn, as the object 
<A NAME="171"></A>of intellection, becomes the cause of intellection and of existence to 
<A NAME="172"></A>the Intellectual-Principle- though, of course, there is another cause of 
<A NAME="173"></A>intellection which is also a cause to Being, both rising in a source distinct 
<A NAME="174"></A>from either.
<A NAME="175"></A><BR><BR>Now while these two are coalescents, having their existence in 
<A NAME="176"></A>common, and are never apart, still the unity they form is two-sided; there 
<A NAME="177"></A>is Intellectual-Principle as against Being, the intellectual agent as against 
<A NAME="178"></A>the object of intellection; we consider the intellective act and we have 
<A NAME="179"></A>the Intellectual-Principle; we think of the object of that act and we have 
<A NAME="180"></A>Being.
<A NAME="181"></A><BR><BR>Such difference there must be if there is to be any intellection; 
<A NAME="182"></A>but similarly there must also be identity [since, in perfect knowing, subject 
<A NAME="183"></A>and object are identical.]
<A NAME="184"></A><BR><BR>Thus the Primals [the first "Categories"] are seen to be: Intellectual-Principle; 
<A NAME="185"></A>Existence; Difference; Identity: we must include also Motion and Rest: 
<A NAME="186"></A>Motion provides for the intellectual act, Rest preserves identity as Difference 
<A NAME="187"></A>gives at once a Knower and a Known, for, failing this, all is one, and 
<A NAME="188"></A>silent.
<A NAME="189"></A><BR><BR>So too the objects of intellection [the ideal content of the Divine 
<A NAME="190"></A>Mind]- identical in virtue of the self-concentration of the principle which 
<A NAME="191"></A>is their common ground- must still be distinct each from another; this 
<A NAME="192"></A>distinction constitutes Difference.
<A NAME="193"></A><BR><BR>The Intellectual Kosmos thus a manifold, Number and Quantity arise: 
<A NAME="194"></A>Quality is the specific character of each of these ideas which stand as 
<A NAME="195"></A>the principles from which all else derives.
<A NAME="196"></A><BR><BR><B>5.</B> As a manifold, then, this God, the Intellectual-Principle, 
<A NAME="197"></A>exists within the Soul here, the Soul which once for all stands linked 
<A NAME="198"></A>a member of the divine, unless by a deliberate apostasy.
<A NAME="199"></A><BR><BR>Bringing itself close to the divine Intellect, becoming, as it 
<A NAME="200"></A>were, one with this, it seeks still further: What Being, now, has engendered 
<A NAME="201"></A>this God, what is the Simplex preceding this multiple; what the cause at 
<A NAME="202"></A>once of its existence and of its existing as a manifold; what the source 
<A NAME="203"></A>of this Number, this Quantity?
<A NAME="204"></A><BR><BR>Number, Quantity, is not primal: obviously before even duality, 
<A NAME="205"></A>there must stand the unity.
<A NAME="206"></A><BR><BR>The Dyad is a secondary; deriving from unity, it finds in unity 
<A NAME="207"></A>the determinant needed by its native indetermination: once there is any 
<A NAME="208"></A>determination, there is Number, in the sense, of course, of the real [the 
<A NAME="209"></A>archetypal] Number. And the soul is such a number or quantity. For the 
<A NAME="210"></A>Primals are not masses or magnitudes; all of that gross order is later, 
<A NAME="211"></A>real only to the sense-thought; even in seed the effective reality is not 
<A NAME="212"></A>the moist substance but the unseen- that is to say Number [as the determinant 
<A NAME="213"></A>of individual being] and the Reason-Principle [of the product to 
<A NAME="214"></A>be].
<A NAME="215"></A><BR><BR>Thus by what we call the Number and the Dyad of that higher realm, 
<A NAME="216"></A>we mean Reason Principles and the Intellectual-Principle: but while the 
<A NAME="217"></A>Dyad is, as regards that sphere, undetermined- representing, as it were, 
<A NAME="218"></A>the underly [or Matter] of The One- the later Number [or Quantity]- that 
<A NAME="219"></A>which rises from the Dyad [Intellectual-Principle] and The One- is not 
<A NAME="220"></A>Matter to the later existents but is their forming-Idea, for all of them 
<A NAME="221"></A>take shape, so to speak, from the ideas rising within this. The determination 
<A NAME="222"></A>of the Dyad is brought about partly from its object- The One- and partly 
<A NAME="223"></A>from itself, as is the case with all vision in the act of sight: intellection 
<A NAME="224"></A>[the Act of the Dyad] is vision occupied upon The One.
<A NAME="225"></A><BR><BR><B>6.</B> But how and what does the Intellectual-Principle see 
<A NAME="226"></A>and, especially, how has it sprung from that which is to become the object 
<A NAME="227"></A>of its vision?
<A NAME="228"></A><BR><BR>The mind demands the existence of these Beings, but it is still 
<A NAME="229"></A>in trouble over the problem endlessly debated by the most ancient philosophers: 
<A NAME="230"></A>from such a unity as we have declared The One to be, how does anything 
<A NAME="231"></A>at all come into substantial existence, any multiplicity, dyad, or number? 
<A NAME="232"></A>Why has the Primal not remained self-gathered so that there be none of 
<A NAME="233"></A>this profusion of the manifold which we observe in existence and yet are 
<A NAME="234"></A>compelled to trace to that absolute unity?
<A NAME="235"></A><BR><BR>In venturing an answer, we first invoke God Himself, not in loud 
<A NAME="236"></A>word but in that way of prayer which is always within our power, leaning 
<A NAME="237"></A>in soul towards Him by aspiration, alone towards the alone. But if we seek 
<A NAME="238"></A>the vision of that great Being within the Inner Sanctuary- self-gathered, 
<A NAME="239"></A>tranquilly remote above all else- we begin by considering the images stationed 
<A NAME="240"></A>at the outer precincts, or, more exactly to the moment, the first image 
<A NAME="241"></A>that appears. How the Divine Mind comes into being must be 
<A NAME="242"></A>explained:
<A NAME="243"></A><BR><BR>Everything moving has necessarily an object towards which it advances; 
<A NAME="244"></A>but since the Supreme can have no such object, we may not ascribe motion 
<A NAME="245"></A>to it: anything that comes into being after it can be produced only as 
<A NAME="246"></A>a consequence of its unfailing self-intention; and, of course, we dare 
<A NAME="247"></A>not talk of generation in time, dealing as we are with eternal Beings: 
<A NAME="248"></A>where we speak of origin in such reference, it is in the sense, merely, 
<A NAME="249"></A>of cause and subordination: origin from the Supreme must not be taken to 
<A NAME="250"></A>imply any movement in it: that would make the Being resulting from the 
<A NAME="251"></A>movement not a second principle but a third: the Movement would be the 
<A NAME="252"></A>second hypostasis.
<A NAME="253"></A><BR><BR>Given this immobility in the Supreme, it can neither have yielded 
<A NAME="254"></A>assent nor uttered decree nor stirred in any way towards the existence 
<A NAME="255"></A>of a secondary.
<A NAME="256"></A><BR><BR>What happened then? What are we to conceive as rising in the neighbourhood 
<A NAME="257"></A>of that immobility?
<A NAME="258"></A><BR><BR>It must be a circumradiation- produced from the Supreme but from 
<A NAME="259"></A>the Supreme unaltering- and may be compared to the brilliant light encircling 
<A NAME="260"></A>the sun and ceaselessly generated from that unchanging 
<A NAME="261"></A>substance.
<A NAME="262"></A><BR><BR>All existences, as long as they retain their character, produce- 
<A NAME="263"></A>about themselves, from their essence, in virtue of the power which must 
<A NAME="264"></A>be in them- some necessary, outward-facing hypostasis continuously attached 
<A NAME="265"></A>to them and representing in image the engendering archetypes: thus fire 
<A NAME="266"></A>gives out its heat; snow is cold not merely to itself; fragrant substances 
<A NAME="267"></A>are a notable instance; for, as long as they last, something is diffused 
<A NAME="268"></A>from them and perceived wherever they are present.
<A NAME="269"></A><BR><BR>Again, all that is fully achieved engenders: therefore the eternally 
<A NAME="270"></A>achieved engenders eternally an eternal being. At the same time, the offspring 
<A NAME="271"></A>is always minor: what then are we to think of the All-Perfect but that 
<A NAME="272"></A>it can produce nothing less than the very greatest that is later than itself. 
<A NAME="273"></A>The greatest, later than the divine unity, must be the Divine Mind, and 
<A NAME="274"></A>it must be the second of all existence, for it is that which sees The One 
<A NAME="275"></A>on which alone it leans while the First has no need whatever of it. The 
<A NAME="276"></A>offspring of the prior to Divine Mind can be no other than that Mind itself 
<A NAME="277"></A>and thus is the loftiest being in the universe, all else following upon 
<A NAME="278"></A>it- the soul, for example, being an utterance and act of the Intellectual-Principle 
<A NAME="279"></A>as that is an utterance and act of The One. But in soul the utterance is 
<A NAME="280"></A>obscured, for soul is an image and must look to its own original: that 
<A NAME="281"></A>Principle, on the contrary, looks to the First without mediation- thus 
<A NAME="282"></A>becoming what it is- and has that vision not as from a distance but as 
<A NAME="283"></A>the immediate next with nothing intervening, close to the One as Soul to 
<A NAME="284"></A>it.
<A NAME="285"></A><BR><BR>The offspring must seek and love the begetter; and especially so 
<A NAME="286"></A>when begetter and begotten are alone in their sphere; when, in addition, 
<A NAME="287"></A>the begetter is the highest good, the offspring [inevitably seeking its 
<A NAME="288"></A>Good] is attached by a bond of sheer necessity, separated only in being 
<A NAME="289"></A>distinct.
<A NAME="290"></A><BR><BR><B>7.</B> We must be more explicit:
<A NAME="291"></A><BR>The Intellectual-Principle stands as the image of The One, firstly 
<A NAME="292"></A>because there is a certain necessity that the first should have its offspring, 
<A NAME="293"></A>carrying onward much of its quality, in other words that there be something 
<A NAME="294"></A>in its likeness as the sun's rays tell of the sun. Yet The One is not an 
<A NAME="295"></A>Intellectual-Principle; how then does it engender an 
<A NAME="296"></A>Intellectual-Principle?
<A NAME="297"></A><BR><BR>Simply by the fact that in its self-quest it has vision: this very 
<A NAME="298"></A>seeing is the Intellectual-Principle. Any perception of the external indicates 
<A NAME="299"></A>either sensation or intellection, sensation symbolized by a line, intellection 
<A NAME="300"></A>by a circle... [corrupt passage].
<A NAME="301"></A><BR><BR>Of course the divisibility belonging to the circle does not apply 
<A NAME="302"></A>to the Intellectual-Principle; all, there too, is a unity, though a unity 
<A NAME="303"></A>which is the potentiality of all existence.
<A NAME="304"></A><BR><BR>The items of this potentiality the divine intellection brings out, 
<A NAME="305"></A>so to speak, from the unity and knows them in detail, as it must if it 
<A NAME="306"></A>is to be an intellectual principle.
<A NAME="307"></A><BR><BR>It has besides a consciousness, as it were, within itself of this 
<A NAME="308"></A>same potentiality; it knows that it can of itself beget an hypostasis and 
<A NAME="309"></A>can determine its own Being by the virtue emanating from its prior; it 
<A NAME="310"></A>knows that its nature is in some sense a definite part of the content of 
<A NAME="311"></A>that First; that it thence derives its essence, that its strength lies 
<A NAME="312"></A>there and that its Being takes perfection as a derivative and a recipient 
<A NAME="313"></A>from the First. It sees that, as a member of the realm of division and 
<A NAME="314"></A>part, it receives life and intellection and all else it has and is, from 
<A NAME="315"></A>the undivided and partless, since that First is no member of existence, 
<A NAME="316"></A>but can be the source of all on condition only of being held down by no 
<A NAME="317"></A>one distinctive shape but remaining the undeflected 
<A NAME="318"></A>unity.
<A NAME="319"></A><BR><BR>[(CORRUPT)- Thus it would be the entire universe but 
<A NAME="320"></A>that...]
<A NAME="321"></A><BR>And so the First is not a thing among the things contained by the Intellectual-Principle 
<A NAME="322"></A>though the source of all. In virtue of this source, things of the later 
<A NAME="323"></A>order are essential beings; for from that fact there is determination; 
<A NAME="324"></A>each has its form: what has being cannot be envisaged as outside of limit; 
<A NAME="325"></A>the nature must be held fast by boundary and fixity; though to the Intellectual 
<A NAME="326"></A>Beings this fixity is no more than determination and form, the foundations 
<A NAME="327"></A>of their substantial existence.
<A NAME="328"></A><BR><BR>A being of this quality, like the Intellectual-Principle, must 
<A NAME="329"></A>be felt to be worthy of the all-pure: it could not derive from any other 
<A NAME="330"></A>than from the first principle of all; as it comes into existence, all other 
<A NAME="331"></A>beings must be simultaneously engendered- all the beauty of the Ideas, 
<A NAME="332"></A>all the Gods of the Intellectual realm. And it still remains pregnant with 
<A NAME="333"></A>this offspring; for it has, so to speak, drawn all within itself again, 
<A NAME="334"></A>holding them lest they fall away towards Matter to be "brought up in the 
<A NAME="335"></A>House of Rhea" [in the realm of flux]. This is the meaning hidden in the 
<A NAME="336"></A>Mysteries, and in the Myths of the gods: Kronos, as the wisest, exists 
<A NAME="337"></A>before Zeus; he must absorb his offspring that, full within himself, he 
<A NAME="338"></A>may be also an Intellectual-Principle manifest in some product of his plenty; 
<A NAME="339"></A>afterwards, the myth proceeds, Kronos engenders Zeus, who already exists 
<A NAME="340"></A>as the [necessary and eternal] outcome of the plenty there; in other words 
<A NAME="341"></A>the offspring of the Divine Intellect, perfect within itself, is Soul [the 
<A NAME="342"></A>life-principle carrying forward the Ideas in the Divine 
<A NAME="343"></A>Mind].
<A NAME="344"></A><BR><BR>Now, even in the Divine the engendered could not be the very highest; 
<A NAME="345"></A>it must be a lesser, an image; it will be undetermined, as the Divine is, 
<A NAME="346"></A>but will receive determination, and, so to speak, its shaping idea, from 
<A NAME="347"></A>the progenitor.
<A NAME="348"></A><BR><BR>Yet any offspring of the Intellectual-Principle must be a Reason-Principle; 
<A NAME="349"></A>the thought of the Divine Mind must be a substantial existence: such then 
<A NAME="350"></A>is that [Soul] which circles about the Divine Mind, its light, its image 
<A NAME="351"></A>inseparably attached to it: on the upper level united with it, filled from 
<A NAME="352"></A>it, enjoying it, participant in its nature, intellective with it, but on 
<A NAME="353"></A>the lower level in contact with the realm beneath itself, or, rather, generating 
<A NAME="354"></A>in turn an offspring which must lie beneath; of this lower we will treat 
<A NAME="355"></A>later; so far we deal still with the Divine.
<A NAME="356"></A><BR><BR><B>8.</B> This is the explanation of Plato's Triplicity, in the 
<A NAME="357"></A>passage where he names as the Primals the Beings gathered about the King 
<A NAME="358"></A>of All, and establishes a Secondary containing the Secondaries, and a Third 
<A NAME="359"></A>containing the Tertiaries.
<A NAME="360"></A><BR><BR>He teaches, also, that there is an author of the Cause, that is 
<A NAME="361"></A>of the Intellectual-Principle, which to him is the Creator who made the 
<A NAME="362"></A>Soul, as he tells us, in the famous mixing bowl. This author of the causing 
<A NAME="363"></A>principle, of the divine mind, is to him the Good, that which transcends 
<A NAME="364"></A>the Intellectual-Principle and transcends Being: often too he uses the 
<A NAME="365"></A>term "The Idea" to indicate Being and the Divine Mind. Thus Plato knows 
<A NAME="366"></A>the order of generation- from the Good, the Intellectual-Principle; from 
<A NAME="367"></A>the Intellectual-Principle, the Soul. These teachings are, therefore, no 
<A NAME="368"></A>novelties, no inventions of today, but long since stated, if not stressed; 
<A NAME="369"></A>our doctrine here is the explanation of an earlier and can show the antiquity 
<A NAME="370"></A>of these opinions on the testimony of Plato himself.
<A NAME="371"></A><BR><BR>Earlier, Parmenides made some approach to the doctrine in identifying 
<A NAME="372"></A>Being with Intellectual-Principle while separating Real Being from the 
<A NAME="373"></A>realm of sense.
<A NAME="374"></A><BR><BR>"Knowing and Being are one thing he says, and this unity is to 
<A NAME="375"></A>him motionless in spite of the intellection he attributes to it: to preserve 
<A NAME="376"></A>its unchanging identity he excludes all bodily movement from it; and he 
<A NAME="377"></A>compares it to a huge sphere in that it holds and envelops all existence 
<A NAME="378"></A>and that its intellection is not an outgoing act but internal. Still, with 
<A NAME="379"></A>all his affirmation of unity, his own writings lay him open to the reproach 
<A NAME="380"></A>that his unity turns out to be a multiplicity.
<A NAME="381"></A><BR><BR>The Platonic Parmenides is more exact; the distinction is made 
<A NAME="382"></A>between the Primal One, a strictly pure Unity, and a secondary One which 
<A NAME="383"></A>is a One-Many and a third which is a One-and-many; thus he too is in accordance 
<A NAME="384"></A>with our thesis of the Three Kinds.
<A NAME="385"></A><BR><BR><B>9.</B> Anaxagoras, again, in his assertion of a Mind pure and 
<A NAME="386"></A>unmixed, affirms a simplex First and a sundered One, though writing long 
<A NAME="387"></A>ago he failed in precision.
<A NAME="388"></A><BR><BR>Heraclitus, with his sense of bodily forms as things of ceaseless 
<A NAME="389"></A>process and passage, knows the One as eternal and intellectual.
<A NAME="390"></A><BR><BR>In Empedocles, similarly, we have a dividing principle, "Strife," 
<A NAME="391"></A>set against "Friendship"- which is The One and is to him bodiless, while 
<A NAME="392"></A>the elements represent Matter.
<A NAME="393"></A><BR><BR>Later there is Aristotle; he begins by making the First transcendent 
<A NAME="394"></A>and intellective but cancels that primacy by supposing it to have self-intellection. 
<A NAME="395"></A>Further he affirms a multitude of other intellective beings- as many indeed 
<A NAME="396"></A>as there are orbs in the heavens; one such principle as in- over to every 
<A NAME="397"></A>orb- and thus his account of the Intellectual Realm differs from Plato's 
<A NAME="398"></A>and, failing reason, he brings in necessity; though whatever reasons he 
<A NAME="399"></A>had alleged there would always have been the objection that it would be 
<A NAME="400"></A>more reasonable that all the spheres, as contributory to one system, should 
<A NAME="401"></A>look to a unity, to the First.
<A NAME="402"></A><BR><BR>We are obliged also to ask whether to Aristotle's mind all Intellectual 
<A NAME="403"></A>Beings spring from one, and that one their First; or whether the Principles 
<A NAME="404"></A>in the Intellectual are many.
<A NAME="405"></A><BR><BR>If from one, then clearly the Intellectual system will be analogous 
<A NAME="406"></A>to that of the universe of sense-sphere encircling sphere, with one, the 
<A NAME="407"></A>outermost, dominating all- the First [in the Intellectual] will envelop 
<A NAME="408"></A>the entire scheme and will be an Intellectual [or Archetypal] Kosmos; and 
<A NAME="409"></A>as in our universe the spheres are not empty but the first sphere is thick 
<A NAME="410"></A>with stars and none without them, so, in the Intellectual Kosmos, those 
<A NAME="411"></A>principles of Movement will envelop a multitude of Beings, and that world 
<A NAME="412"></A>will be the realm of the greater reality.
<A NAME="413"></A><BR><BR>If on the contrary each is a principle, then the effective powers 
<A NAME="414"></A>become a matter of chance; under what compulsion are they to hold together 
<A NAME="415"></A>and act with one mind towards that work of unity, the harmony of the entire 
<A NAME="416"></A>heavenly system? Again what can make it necessary that the material bodies 
<A NAME="417"></A>of the heavenly system be equal in number to the Intellectual moving principles, 
<A NAME="418"></A>and how can these incorporeal Beings be numerically many when there is 
<A NAME="419"></A>no Matter to serve as the basis of difference?
<A NAME="420"></A><BR><BR>For these reasons the ancient philosophers that ranged themselves 
<A NAME="421"></A>most closely to the school of Pythagoras and of his later followers and 
<A NAME="422"></A>to that of Pherekudes, have insisted upon this Nature, some developing 
<A NAME="423"></A>the subject in their writings while others treated of it merely in unwritten 
<A NAME="424"></A>discourses, some no doubt ignoring it entirely.
<A NAME="425"></A><BR><BR><B>10.</B> We have shown the inevitability of certain convictions 
<A NAME="426"></A>as to the scheme of things:
<A NAME="427"></A><BR><BR>There exists a Principle which transcends Being; this is The One, 
<A NAME="428"></A>whose nature we have sought to establish in so far as such matters lend 
<A NAME="429"></A>themselves to proof. Upon The One follows immediately the Principle which 
<A NAME="430"></A>is at once Being and the Intellectual-Principle. Third comes the Principle, 
<A NAME="431"></A>Soul.
<A NAME="432"></A><BR><BR>Now just as these three exist for the system of Nature, so, we 
<A NAME="433"></A>must hold, they exist for ourselves. I am not speaking of the material 
<A NAME="434"></A>order- all that is separable- but of what lies beyond the sense realm in 
<A NAME="435"></A>the same way as the Primals are beyond all the heavens; I mean the corresponding 
<A NAME="436"></A>aspect of man, what Plato calls the Interior Man.
<A NAME="437"></A><BR><BR>Thus our soul, too, is a divine thing, belonging to another order 
<A NAME="438"></A>than sense; such is all that holds the rank of soul, but [above the life-principle] 
<A NAME="439"></A>there is the soul perfected as containing Intellectual-Principle with its 
<A NAME="440"></A>double phase, reasoning and giving the power to reason. The reasoning phase 
<A NAME="441"></A>of the soul, needing no bodily organ for its thinking but maintaining, 
<A NAME="442"></A>in purity, its distinctive Act that its thought may be uncontaminated- 
<A NAME="443"></A>this we cannot err in placing, separate and not mingled into body, within 
<A NAME="444"></A>the first Intellectual. We may not seek any point of space in which to 
<A NAME="445"></A>seat it; it must be set outside of all space: its distinct quality, its 
<A NAME="446"></A>separateness, its immateriality, demand that it be a thing alone, untouched 
<A NAME="447"></A>by all of the bodily order. This is why we read of the universe that the 
<A NAME="448"></A>Demiurge cast the soul around it from without- understand that phase of 
<A NAME="449"></A>soul which is permanently seated in the Intellectual- and of ourselves 
<A NAME="450"></A>that the charioteer's head reaches upwards towards the 
<A NAME="451"></A>heights.
<A NAME="452"></A><BR><BR>The admonition to sever soul from body is not, of course, to be 
<A NAME="453"></A>understood spatially- that separation stands made in Nature- the reference 
<A NAME="454"></A>is to holding our rank, to use of our thinking, to an attitude of alienation 
<A NAME="455"></A>from the body in the effort to lead up and attach to the over-world, equally 
<A NAME="456"></A>with the other, that phase of soul seated here and, alone, having to do 
<A NAME="457"></A>with body, creating, moulding, spending its care upon 
<A NAME="458"></A>it.
<A NAME="459"></A><BR><BR><B>11.</B> Since there is a Soul which reasons upon the right and 
<A NAME="460"></A>good- for reasoning is an enquiry into the rightness and goodness of this 
<A NAME="461"></A>rather than that- there must exist some permanent Right, the source and 
<A NAME="462"></A>foundation of this reasoning in our soul; how, else, could any such discussion 
<A NAME="463"></A>be held? Further, since the soul's attention to these matters is intermittent, 
<A NAME="464"></A>there must be within us an Intellectual-Principle acquainted with that 
<A NAME="465"></A>Right not by momentary act but in permanent possession. Similarly there 
<A NAME="466"></A>must be also the principle of this principle, its cause, God. This Highest 
<A NAME="467"></A>cannot be divided and allotted, must remain intangible but not bound to 
<A NAME="468"></A>space, it may be present at many points, wheresoever there is anything 
<A NAME="469"></A>capable of accepting one of its manifestations; thus a centre is an independent 
<A NAME="470"></A>unity; everything within the circle has its term at the centre; and to 
<A NAME="471"></A>the centre the radii bring each their own. Within our nature is such a 
<A NAME="472"></A>centre by which we grasp and are linked and held; and those of us are firmly 
<A NAME="473"></A>in the Supreme whose collective tendency is There.
<A NAME="474"></A><BR><BR><B>12.</B> Possessed of such powers, how does it happen that we 
<A NAME="475"></A>do not lay hold of them, but for the most part, let these high activities 
<A NAME="476"></A>go idle- some, even, of us never bringing them in any degree to 
<A NAME="477"></A>effect?
<A NAME="478"></A><BR><BR>The answer is that all the Divine Beings are unceasingly about 
<A NAME="479"></A>their own act, the Intellectual-Principle and its Prior always self-intent; 
<A NAME="480"></A>and so, too, the soul maintains its unfailing movement; for not all that 
<A NAME="481"></A>passes in the soul is, by that fact, perceptible; we know just as much 
<A NAME="482"></A>as impinges upon the faculty of sense. Any activity not transmitted to 
<A NAME="483"></A>the sensitive faculty has not traversed the entire soul: we remain unaware 
<A NAME="484"></A>because the human being includes sense-perception; man is not merely a 
<A NAME="485"></A>part [the higher part] of the soul but the total.
<A NAME="486"></A><BR><BR>None the less every being of the order of soul is in continuous 
<A NAME="487"></A>activity as long as life holds, continuously executing to itself its characteristic 
<A NAME="488"></A>act: knowledge of the act depends upon transmission and perception. If 
<A NAME="489"></A>there is to be perception of what is thus present, we must turn the perceptive 
<A NAME="490"></A>faculty inward and hold it to attention there. Hoping to hear a desired 
<A NAME="491"></A>voice, we let all others pass and are alert for the coming at last of that 
<A NAME="492"></A>most welcome of sounds: so here, we must let the hearings of sense go by, 
<A NAME="493"></A>save for sheer necessity, and keep the soul's perception bright and quick 
<A NAME="494"></A>to the sounds from above.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="495"></A><B>Second Tractate</B>

<A NAME="496"></A><BR><BR><B>THE ORIGIN AND ORDER OF THE BEINGS.</B> <B>FOLLOWING ON THE 
<A NAME="497"></A>FIRST.</B>
<A NAME="498"></A><BR><BR><B>1.</B> The One is all things and no one of them; the source 
<A NAME="499"></A>of all things is not all things; all things are its possession- running 
<A NAME="500"></A>back, so to speak, to it- or, more correctly, not yet so, they will 
<A NAME="501"></A>be.
<A NAME="502"></A><BR><BR>But a universe from an unbroken unity, in which there appears no 
<A NAME="503"></A>diversity, not even duality?
<A NAME="504"></A><BR><BR>It is precisely because that is nothing within the One that all 
<A NAME="505"></A>things are from it: in order that Being may be brought about, the source 
<A NAME="506"></A>must be no Being but Being's generator, in what is to be thought of as 
<A NAME="507"></A>the primal act of generation. Seeking nothing, possessing nothing, lacking 
<A NAME="508"></A>nothing, the One is perfect and, in our metaphor, has overflowed, and its 
<A NAME="509"></A>exuberance has produced the new: this product has turned again to its begetter 
<A NAME="510"></A>and been filled and has become its contemplator and so an 
<A NAME="511"></A>Intellectual-Principle.
<A NAME="512"></A><BR><BR>That station towards the one [the fact that something exists in 
<A NAME="513"></A>presence of the One] establishes Being; that vision directed upon the One 
<A NAME="514"></A>establishes the Intellectual-Principle; standing towards the One to the 
<A NAME="515"></A>end of vision, it is simultaneously Intellectual-Principle and Being; and, 
<A NAME="516"></A>attaining resemblance in virtue of this vision, it repeats the act of the 
<A NAME="517"></A>One in pouring forth a vast power.
<A NAME="518"></A><BR><BR>This second outflow is a Form or Idea representing the Divine Intellect 
<A NAME="519"></A>as the Divine Intellect represented its own prior, The 
<A NAME="520"></A>One.
<A NAME="521"></A><BR><BR>This active power sprung from essence [from the Intellectual-Principle 
<A NAME="522"></A>considered as Being] is Soul.
<A NAME="523"></A><BR><BR>Soul arises as the idea and act of the motionless Intellectual-Principle- 
<A NAME="524"></A>which itself sprang from its own motionless prior- but the soul's operation 
<A NAME="525"></A>is not similarly motionless; its image is generated from its movement. 
<A NAME="526"></A>It takes fulness by looking to its source; but it generates its image by 
<A NAME="527"></A>adopting another, a downward, movement.
<A NAME="528"></A><BR><BR>This image of Soul is Sense and Nature, the vegetal 
<A NAME="529"></A>principle.
<A NAME="530"></A><BR>Nothing, however, is completely severed from its prior. Thus the human 
<A NAME="531"></A>Soul appears to reach away as far down as to the vegetal order: in some 
<A NAME="532"></A>sense it does, since the life of growing things is within its province; 
<A NAME="533"></A>but it is not present entire; when it has reached the vegetal order it 
<A NAME="534"></A>is there in the sense that having moved thus far downwards it produces- 
<A NAME="535"></A>by its outgoing and its tendency towards the less good- another hypostasis 
<A NAME="536"></A>or form of being just as its prior (the loftier phase of the Soul) is produced 
<A NAME="537"></A>from the Intellectual-Principle which yet remains in untroubled 
<A NAME="538"></A>self-possession.
<A NAME="539"></A><BR><BR><B>2.</B> To resume: there is from the first principle to ultimate 
<A NAME="540"></A>an outgoing in which unfailingly each principle retains its own seat while 
<A NAME="541"></A>its offshoot takes another rank, a lower, though on the other hand every 
<A NAME="542"></A>being is in identity with its prior as long as it holds that 
<A NAME="543"></A>contact.
<A NAME="544"></A><BR><BR>In the case of soul entering some vegetal form, what is there is 
<A NAME="545"></A>one phase, the more rebellious and less intellectual, outgone to that extreme; 
<A NAME="546"></A>in a soul entering an animal, the faculty of sensation has been dominant 
<A NAME="547"></A>and brought it there; in soul entering man, the movement outward has either 
<A NAME="548"></A>been wholly of its reasoning part or has come from the Intellectual-Principle 
<A NAME="549"></A>in the sense that the soul, possessing that principle as immanent to its 
<A NAME="550"></A>being, has an inborn desire of intellectual activity and of movement in 
<A NAME="551"></A>general.
<A NAME="552"></A><BR><BR>But, looking more minutely into the matter, when shoots or topmost 
<A NAME="553"></A>boughs are lopped from some growing thing, where goes the soul that was 
<A NAME="554"></A>present in them? Simply, whence it came: soul never knew spatial separation 
<A NAME="555"></A>and therefore is always within the source. If you cut the root to pieces, 
<A NAME="556"></A>or burn it, where is the life that was present there? In the soul, which 
<A NAME="557"></A>never went outside of itself.
<A NAME="558"></A><BR><BR>No doubt, despite this permanence, the soul must have been in something 
<A NAME="559"></A>if it reascends; and if it does not, it is still somewhere; it is in some 
<A NAME="560"></A>other vegetal soul: but all this means merely that it is not crushed into 
<A NAME="561"></A>some one spot; if a Soul-power reascends, it is within the Soul-power preceding 
<A NAME="562"></A>it; that in turn can be only in the soul-power prior again, the phase reaching 
<A NAME="563"></A>upwards to the Intellectual-Principle. Of course nothing here must be understood 
<A NAME="564"></A>spatially: Soul never was in space; and the Divine Intellect, again, is 
<A NAME="565"></A>distinguished from soul as being still more free.
<A NAME="566"></A><BR><BR>Soul thus is nowhere but in the Principle which has that characteristic 
<A NAME="567"></A>existence at once nowhere and everywhere.
<A NAME="568"></A><BR><BR>If the soul on its upward path has halted midway before wholly 
<A NAME="569"></A>achieving the supreme heights, it has a mid-rank life and has centred itself 
<A NAME="570"></A>upon the mid-phase of its being. All in that mid-region is Intellectual-Principle 
<A NAME="571"></A>not wholly itself- nothing else because deriving thence [and therefore 
<A NAME="572"></A>of that name and rank], yet not that because the Intellectual-Principle 
<A NAME="573"></A>in giving it forth is not merged into it.
<A NAME="574"></A><BR><BR>There exists, thus, a life, as it were, of huge extension, a total 
<A NAME="575"></A>in which each several part differs from its next, all making a self-continuous 
<A NAME="576"></A>whole under a law of discrimination by which the various forms of things 
<A NAME="577"></A>arise with no effacement of any prior in its secondary.
<A NAME="578"></A><BR><BR>But does this Soul-phase in the vegetal order, produce 
<A NAME="579"></A>nothing?
<A NAME="580"></A><BR>It engenders precisely the Kind in which it is thus present: how, is 
<A NAME="581"></A>a question to be handled from another starting-point.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="582"></A><B>Third Tractate</B>

<A NAME="583"></A><BR><BR><B>THE KNOWING HYPOSTASES AND THE</B> <B>TRANSCENDENT.</B>
<A NAME="584"></A><BR><BR><B>1.</B> Are we to think that a being knowing itself must contain 
<A NAME="585"></A>diversity, that self-knowledge can be affirmed only when some one phase 
<A NAME="586"></A>of the self perceives other phases, and that therefore an absolutely simplex 
<A NAME="587"></A>entity would be equally incapable of introversion and of 
<A NAME="588"></A>self-awareness?
<A NAME="589"></A><BR><BR>No: a being that has no parts or phases may have this consciousness; 
<A NAME="590"></A>in fact there would be no real self-knowing in an entity presented as knowing 
<A NAME="591"></A>itself in virtue of being a compound- some single element in it perceiving 
<A NAME="592"></A>other elements- as we may know our own form and entire bodily organism 
<A NAME="593"></A>by sense-perception: such knowing does not cover the whole field; the knowing 
<A NAME="594"></A>element has not had the required cognisance at once of its associates and 
<A NAME="595"></A>of itself; this is not the self-knower asked for; it is merely something 
<A NAME="596"></A>that knows something else.
<A NAME="597"></A><BR><BR>Either we must exhibit the self-knowing of an uncompounded being- 
<A NAME="598"></A>and show how that is possible- or abandon the belief that any being can 
<A NAME="599"></A>possess veritable self-cognition.
<A NAME="600"></A><BR><BR>To abandon the belief is not possible in view of the many absurdities 
<A NAME="601"></A>thus entailed.
<A NAME="602"></A><BR><BR>It would be already absurd enough to deny this power to the soul 
<A NAME="603"></A>or mind, but the very height of absurdity to deny it to the nature of the 
<A NAME="604"></A>Intellectual-Principle, presented thus as knowing the rest of things but 
<A NAME="605"></A>not attaining to knowledge, or even awareness, of itself.
<A NAME="606"></A><BR><BR>It is the province of sense and in some degree of understanding 
<A NAME="607"></A>and judgement, but not of the Intellectual-Principle, to handle the external, 
<A NAME="608"></A>though whether the Intellectual-Principle holds the knowledge of these 
<A NAME="609"></A>things is a question to be examined, but it is obvious that the Intellectual-Principle 
<A NAME="610"></A>must have knowledge of the Intellectual objects. Now, can it know those 
<A NAME="611"></A>objects alone or must it not simultaneously know itself, the being whose 
<A NAME="612"></A>function it is to know just those things? Can it have self-knowledge in 
<A NAME="613"></A>the sense [dismissed above as inadequate] of knowing its content while 
<A NAME="614"></A>it ignores itself? Can it be aware of knowing its members and yet remain 
<A NAME="615"></A>in ignorance of its own knowing self? Self and content must be simultaneously 
<A NAME="616"></A>present: the method and degree of this knowledge we must now 
<A NAME="617"></A>consider.
<A NAME="618"></A><BR><BR><B>2.</B> We begin with the soul, asking whether it is to be allowed 
<A NAME="619"></A>self-knowledge and what the knowing principle in it would be and how 
<A NAME="620"></A>operating.
<A NAME="621"></A><BR><BR>The sense-principle in it we may at once decide, takes cognisance 
<A NAME="622"></A>only of the external; even in any awareness of events within the body it 
<A NAME="623"></A>occupies, this is still the perception of something external to a principle 
<A NAME="624"></A>dealing with those bodily conditions not as within but as beneath 
<A NAME="625"></A>itself.
<A NAME="626"></A><BR><BR>The reasoning-principle in the Soul acts upon the representations 
<A NAME="627"></A>standing before it as the result of sense-perception; these it judges, 
<A NAME="628"></A>combining, distinguishing: or it may also observe the impressions, so to 
<A NAME="629"></A>speak, rising from the Intellectual-Principle, and has the same power of 
<A NAME="630"></A>handling these; and reasoning will develop to wisdom where it recognizes 
<A NAME="631"></A>the new and late-coming impressions [those of sense] and adapts them, so 
<A NAME="632"></A>to speak, to those it holds from long before- the act which may be described 
<A NAME="633"></A>as the soul's Reminiscence.
<A NAME="634"></A><BR><BR>So far as this, the efficacy of the Intellectual-Principle in the 
<A NAME="635"></A>Soul certainly reaches; but is there also introversion and self-cognition 
<A NAME="636"></A>or is that power to be reserved strictly for the Divine 
<A NAME="637"></A>Mind?
<A NAME="638"></A><BR><BR>If we accord self-knowing to this phase of the soul we make it 
<A NAME="639"></A>an Intellectual-Principle and will have to show what distinguishes it from 
<A NAME="640"></A>its prior; if we refuse it self-knowing, all our thought brings us step 
<A NAME="641"></A>by step to some principle which has this power, and we must discover what 
<A NAME="642"></A>such self-knowing consists in. If, again, we do allow self-knowledge in 
<A NAME="643"></A>the lower we must examine the question of degree; for if there is no difference 
<A NAME="644"></A>of degree, then the reasoning principle in soul is the Intellectual-Principle 
<A NAME="645"></A>unalloyed.
<A NAME="646"></A><BR><BR>We ask, then, whether the understanding principle in the soul has 
<A NAME="647"></A>equally the power of turning inwards upon itself or whether it has no more 
<A NAME="648"></A>than that of comprehending the impressions, superior and inferior, which 
<A NAME="649"></A>it receives.
<A NAME="650"></A><BR><BR>The first stage is to discover what this comprehension 
<A NAME="651"></A>is.
<A NAME="652"></A><BR><B>3.</B> Sense sees a man and transmits the impression to the understanding. 
<A NAME="653"></A>What does the understanding say? It has nothing to say as yet; it accepts 
<A NAME="654"></A>and waits; unless, rather, it questions within itself "Who is this?"- someone 
<A NAME="655"></A>it has met before- and then, drawing on memory, says, 
<A NAME="656"></A>"Socrates."
<A NAME="657"></A><BR><BR>If it should go on to develop the impression received, it distinguishes 
<A NAME="658"></A>various elements in what the representative faculty has set before it; 
<A NAME="659"></A>supposing it to say "Socrates, if the man is good," then, while it has 
<A NAME="660"></A>spoken upon information from the senses, its total pronouncement is its 
<A NAME="661"></A>own; it contains within itself a standard of good.
<A NAME="662"></A><BR><BR>But how does it thus contain the good within 
<A NAME="663"></A>itself?
<A NAME="664"></A><BR>It is, itself, of the nature of the good and it has been strengthened 
<A NAME="665"></A>still towards the perception of all that is good by the irradiation of 
<A NAME="666"></A>the Intellectual-Principle upon it; for this pure phase of the soul welcomes 
<A NAME="667"></A>to itself the images implanted from its prior.
<A NAME="668"></A><BR><BR>But why may we not distinguish this understanding phase as Intellectual-Principle 
<A NAME="669"></A>and take soul to consist of the later phases from the sensitive 
<A NAME="670"></A>downwards?
<A NAME="671"></A><BR><BR>Because all the activities mentioned are within the scope of a 
<A NAME="672"></A>reasoning faculty, and reasoning is characteristically the function of 
<A NAME="673"></A>soul.
<A NAME="674"></A><BR><BR>Why not, however, absolve the question by assigning self-cognisance 
<A NAME="675"></A>to this phase?
<A NAME="676"></A><BR><BR>Because we have allotted to soul the function of dealing- in thought 
<A NAME="677"></A>and in multiform action- with the external, and we hold that observation 
<A NAME="678"></A>of self and of the content of self must belong to Intellectual-Principle.
<A NAME="679"></A><BR><BR>If any one says, "Still; what precludes the reasoning soul from 
<A NAME="680"></A>observing its own content by some special faculty?" he is no longer posting 
<A NAME="681"></A>a principle of understanding or of reasoning but, simply, bringing in the 
<A NAME="682"></A>Intellectual-Principle unalloyed.
<A NAME="683"></A><BR><BR>But what precludes the Intellectual-Principle from being present, 
<A NAME="684"></A>unalloyed, within the soul? Nothing, we admit; but are we entitled therefore 
<A NAME="685"></A>to think of it as a phase of soul?
<A NAME="686"></A><BR><BR>We cannot describe it as belonging to the soul though we do describe 
<A NAME="687"></A>it as our Intellectual-Principle, something distinct from the understanding, 
<A NAME="688"></A>advanced above it, and yet ours even though we cannot include it among 
<A NAME="689"></A>soul-phases: it is ours and not ours; and therefore we use it sometimes 
<A NAME="690"></A>and sometimes not, whereas we always have use of the understanding; the 
<A NAME="691"></A>Intellectual-Principle is ours when we act by it, not ours when we neglect 
<A NAME="692"></A>it.
<A NAME="693"></A><BR><BR>But what is this acting by it? Does it mean that we become the 
<A NAME="694"></A>Intellectual-Principle so that our utterance is the utterance of the Intellectual-Principle, 
<A NAME="695"></A>or that we represent it?
<A NAME="696"></A><BR><BR>We are not the Intellectual-Principle; we represent it in virtue 
<A NAME="697"></A>of that highest reasoning faculty which draws upon it.
<A NAME="698"></A><BR><BR>Still; we perceive by means of the perceptive faculty and are, 
<A NAME="699"></A>ourselves, the percipients: may we not say the same of the intellective 
<A NAME="700"></A>act?
<A NAME="701"></A><BR><BR>No: our reasoning is our own; we ourselves think the thoughts that 
<A NAME="702"></A>occupy the understanding- for this is actually the We- but the operation 
<A NAME="703"></A>of the Intellectual-Principle enters from above us as that of the sensitive 
<A NAME="704"></A>faculty from below; the We is the soul at its highest, the mid-point between 
<A NAME="705"></A>two powers, between the sensitive principle, inferior to us, and the intellectual 
<A NAME="706"></A>principle superior. We think of the perceptive act as integral to ourselves 
<A NAME="707"></A>because our sense-perception is uninterrupted; we hesitate as to the Intellectual-Principle 
<A NAME="708"></A>both because we are not always occupied with it and because it exists apart, 
<A NAME="709"></A>not a principle inclining to us but one to which we incline when we choose 
<A NAME="710"></A>to look upwards.
<A NAME="711"></A><BR><BR>The sensitive principle is our scout; the Intellectual-Principle 
<A NAME="712"></A>our King.
<A NAME="713"></A><BR><BR><B>4.</B> But we, too, are king when we are moulded to the 
<A NAME="714"></A>Intellectual-Principle.
<A NAME="715"></A><BR><BR>That correspondence may be brought about in two ways: either the 
<A NAME="716"></A>radii from that centre are traced upon us to be our law or we are filled 
<A NAME="717"></A>full of the Divine Mind, which again may have become to us a thing seen 
<A NAME="718"></A>and felt as a presence.
<A NAME="719"></A><BR><BR>Hence our self-knowing comes to the knowing of all the rest of 
<A NAME="720"></A>our being in virtue of this thing patently present; or by that power itself 
<A NAME="721"></A>communicating to us its own power of self-knowing; or by our becoming identical 
<A NAME="722"></A>with that principle of knowledge.
<A NAME="723"></A><BR><BR>Thus the self-knower is a double person: there is the one that 
<A NAME="724"></A>takes cognisance of the principle in virtue of which understanding occurs 
<A NAME="725"></A>in the soul or mind; and there is the higher, knowing himself by the Intellectual-Principle 
<A NAME="726"></A>with which he becomes identical: this latter knows the self as no longer 
<A NAME="727"></A>man but as a being that has become something other through and through: 
<A NAME="728"></A>he has thrown himself as one thing over into the superior order, taking 
<A NAME="729"></A>with him only that better part of the soul which alone is winged for the 
<A NAME="730"></A>Intellectual Act and gives the man, once established There, the power to 
<A NAME="731"></A>appropriate what he has seen.
<A NAME="732"></A><BR><BR>We can scarcely suppose this understanding faculty to be unaware 
<A NAME="733"></A>that it has understanding; that it takes cognisance of things external; 
<A NAME="734"></A>that in its judgements it decides by the rules and standards within itself 
<A NAME="735"></A>held directly from the Intellectual-Principle; that there is something 
<A NAME="736"></A>higher than itself, something which, moreover, it has no need to seek but 
<A NAME="737"></A>fully possesses. What can we conceive to escape the self-knowledge of a 
<A NAME="738"></A>principle which admittedly knows the place it holds and the work it has 
<A NAME="739"></A>to do? It affirms that it springs from Intellectual-Principle whose second 
<A NAME="740"></A>and image it is, that it holds all within itself, the universe of things, 
<A NAME="741"></A>engraved, so to say, upon it as all is held There by the eternal engraver. 
<A NAME="742"></A>Aware so far of itself, can it be supposed to halt at that? Are we to suppose 
<A NAME="743"></A>that all we can do is to apply a distinct power of our nature and come 
<A NAME="744"></A>thus to awareness of that Intellectual-Principle as aware of itself? Or 
<A NAME="745"></A>may we not appropriate that principle- which belongs to us as we to it- 
<A NAME="746"></A>and thus attain to awareness, at once, of it and of ourselves? Yes: this 
<A NAME="747"></A>is the necessary way if we are to experience the self-knowledge vested 
<A NAME="748"></A>in the Intellectual-Principle. And a man becomes Intellectual-Principle 
<A NAME="749"></A>when, ignoring all other phases of his being, he sees through that only 
<A NAME="750"></A>and sees only that and so knows himself by means of the self- in other 
<A NAME="751"></A>words attains the self-knowledge which the Intellectual-Principle 
<A NAME="752"></A>possesses.
<A NAME="753"></A><BR><BR><B>5.</B> Does it all come down, then, to one phase of the self 
<A NAME="754"></A>knowing another phase?
<A NAME="755"></A><BR><BR>That would be a case of knower distinguished from known, and would 
<A NAME="756"></A>not be self-knowing.
<A NAME="757"></A><BR><BR>What, then, if the total combination were supposed to be of one 
<A NAME="758"></A>piece, knower quite undistinguished from known, so that, seeing any given 
<A NAME="759"></A>part of itself as identical with itself, it sees itself by means of itself, 
<A NAME="760"></A>knower and known thus being entirely without differentiation?
<A NAME="761"></A><BR><BR>To begin with, the distinction in one self thus suggested is a 
<A NAME="762"></A>strange phenomenon. How is the self to make the partition? The thing cannot 
<A NAME="763"></A>happen of itself. And, again, which phase makes it? The phase that decides 
<A NAME="764"></A>to be the knower or that which is to be the known? Then how can the knowing 
<A NAME="765"></A>phase know itself in the known when it has chosen to be the knower and 
<A NAME="766"></A>put itself apart from the known? In such self-knowledge by sundering it 
<A NAME="767"></A>can be aware only of the object, not of the agent; it will not know its 
<A NAME="768"></A>entire content, or itself as an integral whole; it knows the phase seen 
<A NAME="769"></A>but not the seeing phase and thus has knowledge of something else, not 
<A NAME="770"></A>self-knowledge.
<A NAME="771"></A><BR><BR>In order to perfect self-knowing it must bring over from itself 
<A NAME="772"></A>the knowing phase as well: seeing subject and seen objects must be present 
<A NAME="773"></A>as one thing. Now if in this coalescence of seeing subject with seen objects, 
<A NAME="774"></A>the objects were merely representations of the reality, the subject would 
<A NAME="775"></A>not possess the realities: if it is to possess them it must do so not by 
<A NAME="776"></A>seeing them as the result of any self-division but by knowing them, containing 
<A NAME="777"></A>them, before any self-division occurs.
<A NAME="778"></A><BR><BR>At that, the object known must be identical with the knowing act 
<A NAME="779"></A>[or agent], the Intellectual-Principle, therefore, identical with the Intellectual 
<A NAME="780"></A>Realm. And in fact, if this identity does not exist, neither does truth; 
<A NAME="781"></A>the Principle that should contain realities is found to contain a transcript, 
<A NAME="782"></A>something different from the realities; that constitutes non-Truth; Truth 
<A NAME="783"></A>cannot apply to something conflicting with itself; what it affirms it must 
<A NAME="784"></A>also be.
<A NAME="785"></A><BR><BR>Thus we find that the Intellectual-Principle, the Intellectual 
<A NAME="786"></A>Realm and Real Being constitute one thing, which is the Primal Being; the 
<A NAME="787"></A>primal Intellectual-Principle is that which contains the realities or, 
<A NAME="788"></A>rather, which is identical with them.
<A NAME="789"></A><BR><BR>But taking Primal Intellection and its intellectual object to be 
<A NAME="790"></A>a unity, how does that give an Intellective Being knowing itself? An intellection 
<A NAME="791"></A>enveloping its object or identical with it is far from exhibiting the Intellectual-Principle 
<A NAME="792"></A>as self-knowing.
<A NAME="793"></A><BR><BR>All turns on the identity. The intellectual object is itself an 
<A NAME="794"></A>activity, not a mere potentiality; it is not lifeless; nor are the life 
<A NAME="795"></A>and intellection brought into it as into something naturally devoid of 
<A NAME="796"></A>them, some stone or other dead matter; no, the intellectual object is essentially 
<A NAME="797"></A>existent, the primal reality. As an active force, the first activity, it 
<A NAME="798"></A>must be, also itself, the noblest intellection, intellection possessing 
<A NAME="799"></A>real being since it is entirely true; and such an intellection, primal 
<A NAME="800"></A>and primally existent, can be no other than the primal principle of Intellection: 
<A NAME="801"></A>for that primal principle is no potentiality and cannot be an agent distinct 
<A NAME="802"></A>from its act and thus, once more, possessing its essential being as a mere 
<A NAME="803"></A>potentiality. As an act- and one whose very being is an act- it must be 
<A NAME="804"></A>undistinguishably identical with its act: but Being and the Intellectual 
<A NAME="805"></A>object are also identical with that act; therefore the Intellectual-Principle, 
<A NAME="806"></A>its exercise of intellection and the object of intellection all are identical. 
<A NAME="807"></A>Given its intellection identical with intellectual object and the object 
<A NAME="808"></A>identical with the Principle itself, it cannot but have self-knowledge: 
<A NAME="809"></A>its intellection operates by the intellectual act which is itself upon 
<A NAME="810"></A>the intellectual object which similarly is itself. It possesses self-knowing, 
<A NAME="811"></A>thus, on every count; the act is itself; and the object seen in that act- 
<A NAME="812"></A>self, is itself.
<A NAME="813"></A><BR><BR><B>6.</B> Thus we have shown that there exists that which in the 
<A NAME="814"></A>strictest sense possesses self-knowing.
<A NAME="815"></A><BR><BR>This self-knowing agent, perfect in the Intellectual-Principle, 
<A NAME="816"></A>is modified in the Soul.
<A NAME="817"></A><BR><BR>The difference is that, while the soul knows itself as within something 
<A NAME="818"></A>else, the Intellectual-Principle knows itself as self-depending, knows 
<A NAME="819"></A>all its nature and character, and knows by right of its own being and by 
<A NAME="820"></A>simple introversion. When it looks upon the authentic existences it is 
<A NAME="821"></A>looking upon itself; its vision as its effective existence, and this efficacy 
<A NAME="822"></A>is itself since the Intellectual-Principle and the Intellectual Act are 
<A NAME="823"></A>one: this is an integral seeing itself by its entire being, not a part 
<A NAME="824"></A>seeing by a part.
<A NAME="825"></A><BR><BR>But has our discussion issued in an Intellectual-Principle having 
<A NAME="826"></A>a persuasive activity [furnishing us with probability]?
<A NAME="827"></A><BR><BR>No: it brings compulsion not persuasion; compulsion belongs to 
<A NAME="828"></A>the Intellectual-Principle, persuasion to the soul or mind, and we seem 
<A NAME="829"></A>to desire to be persuaded rather than to see the truth in the pure 
<A NAME="830"></A>intellect.
<A NAME="831"></A><BR><BR>As long as we were Above, collected within the Intellectual nature, 
<A NAME="832"></A>we were satisfied; we were held in the intellectual act; we had vision 
<A NAME="833"></A>because we drew all into unity- for the thinker in us was the Intellectual-Principle 
<A NAME="834"></A>telling us of itself- and the soul or mind was motionless, assenting to 
<A NAME="835"></A>that act of its prior. But now that we are once more here- living in the 
<A NAME="836"></A>secondary, the soul- we seek for persuasive probabilities: it is through 
<A NAME="837"></A>the image we desire to know the archetype.
<A NAME="838"></A><BR><BR>Our way is to teach our soul how the Intellectual-Principle exercises 
<A NAME="839"></A>self-vision; the phase thus to be taught is that which already touches 
<A NAME="840"></A>the intellective order, that which we call the understanding or intelligent 
<A NAME="841"></A>soul, indicating by the very name that it is already of itself in some 
<A NAME="842"></A>degree an Intellectual-Principle or that it holds its peculiar power through 
<A NAME="843"></A>and from that Principle. This phase must be brought to understand by what 
<A NAME="844"></A>means it has knowledge of the thing it sees and warrant for what it affirms: 
<A NAME="845"></A>if it became what it affirms, it would by that fact possess self-knowing. 
<A NAME="846"></A>All its vision and affirmation being in the Supreme or deriving from it- 
<A NAME="847"></A>There where itself also is- it will possess self-knowledge by its right 
<A NAME="848"></A>as a Reason-Principle, claiming its kin and bringing all into accord with 
<A NAME="849"></A>the divine imprint upon it.
<A NAME="850"></A><BR><BR>The soul therefore [to attain self-knowledge] has only to set this 
<A NAME="851"></A>image [that is to say, its highest phase] alongside the veritable Intellectual-Principle 
<A NAME="852"></A>which we have found to be identical with the truths constituting the objects 
<A NAME="853"></A>of intellection, the world of Primals and Reality: for this Intellectual-Principle, 
<A NAME="854"></A>by very definition, cannot be outside of itself, the Intellectual Reality: 
<A NAME="855"></A>self-gathered and unalloyed, it is Intellectual-Principle through all the 
<A NAME="856"></A>range of its being- for unintelligent intelligence is not possible- and 
<A NAME="857"></A>thus it possesses of necessity self-knowing, as a being immanent to itself 
<A NAME="858"></A>and one having for function and essence to be purely and solely Intellectual-Principle. 
<A NAME="859"></A>This is no doer; the doer, not self-intent but looking outward, will have 
<A NAME="860"></A>knowledge, in some kind, of the external, but, if wholly of this practical 
<A NAME="861"></A>order, need have no self-knowledge; where, on the contrary, there is no 
<A NAME="862"></A>action- and of course the pure Intellectual-Principle cannot be straining 
<A NAME="863"></A>after any absent good- the intention can be only towards the self; at once 
<A NAME="864"></A>self-knowing becomes not merely plausible but inevitable; what else could 
<A NAME="865"></A>living signify in a being immune from action and existing in 
<A NAME="866"></A>Intellect?
<A NAME="867"></A><BR><BR><B>7.</B> The contemplating of God, we might 
<A NAME="868"></A>answer.
<A NAME="869"></A><BR>But to admit its knowing God is to be compelled to admit its self-knowing. 
<A NAME="870"></A>It will know what it holds from God, what God has given forth or may; with 
<A NAME="871"></A>this knowledge, it knows itself at the stroke, for it is itself one of 
<A NAME="872"></A>those given things- in fact is all of them. Knowing God and His power, 
<A NAME="873"></A>then, it knows itself, since it comes from Him and carries His power upon 
<A NAME="874"></A>it; if, because here the act of vision is identical with the object, it 
<A NAME="875"></A>is unable to see God clearly, then all the more, by the equation of seeing 
<A NAME="876"></A>and seen, we are driven back upon that self-seeing and self-knowing in 
<A NAME="877"></A>which seeing and thing seen are undistinguishably one 
<A NAME="878"></A>thing.
<A NAME="879"></A><BR><BR>And what else is there to attribute to it?
<A NAME="880"></A><BR>Repose, no doubt; but, to an Intellectual-Principle, Repose is not 
<A NAME="881"></A>an abdication from intellect; its Repose is an Act, the act of abstention 
<A NAME="882"></A>from the alien: in all forms of existence repose from the alien leaves 
<A NAME="883"></A>the characteristic activity intact, especially where the Being is not merely 
<A NAME="884"></A>potential but fully realized.
<A NAME="885"></A><BR><BR>In the Intellectual-Principle, the Being is an Act and in the absence 
<A NAME="886"></A>of any other object it must be self-directed; by this self-intellection 
<A NAME="887"></A>it holds its Act within itself and upon itself; all that can emanate from 
<A NAME="888"></A>it is produced by this self-centering and self-intention; first- self-gathered, 
<A NAME="889"></A>it then gives itself or gives something in its likeness; fire must first 
<A NAME="890"></A>be self-centred and be fire, true to fire's natural Act; then it may reproduce 
<A NAME="891"></A>itself elsewhere.
<A NAME="892"></A><BR><BR>Once more, then; the Intellectual-Principle is a self-intent activity, 
<A NAME="893"></A>but soul has the double phase, one inner, intent upon the Intellectual-Principle, 
<A NAME="894"></A>the other outside it and facing to the external; by the one it holds the 
<A NAME="895"></A>likeness to its source; by the other, even in its unlikeness, it still 
<A NAME="896"></A>comes to likeness in this sphere, too, by virtue of action and production; 
<A NAME="897"></A>in its action it still contemplates, and its production produces Ideal-forms- 
<A NAME="898"></A>divine intellections perfectly wrought out- so that all its creations are 
<A NAME="899"></A>representations of the divine Intellection and of the divine Intellect, 
<A NAME="900"></A>moulded upon the archetype, of which all are emanations and images, the 
<A NAME="901"></A>nearer more true, the very latest preserving some faint likeness of the 
<A NAME="902"></A>source.
<A NAME="903"></A><BR><BR><B>8.</B> Now comes the question what sort of thing does the Intellectual-Principle 
<A NAME="904"></A>see in seeing the Intellectual Realm and what in seeing 
<A NAME="905"></A>itself?
<A NAME="906"></A><BR><BR>We are not to look for an Intellectual realm reminding us of the 
<A NAME="907"></A>colour or shape to be seen on material objects: the intellectual antedates 
<A NAME="908"></A>all such things; and even in our sphere the production is very different 
<A NAME="909"></A>from the Reason-Principle in the seeds from which it is produced. The seed 
<A NAME="910"></A>principles are invisible and the beings of the Intellectual still more 
<A NAME="911"></A>characteristically so; the Intellectuals are of one same nature with the 
<A NAME="912"></A>Intellectual Realm which contains them, just as the Reason-Principle in 
<A NAME="913"></A>the seed is identical with the soul, or life-principle, containing 
<A NAME="914"></A>it.
<A NAME="915"></A><BR><BR>But the Soul (considered as apart from the Intellectual-Principle) 
<A NAME="916"></A>has no vision of what it thus contains, for it is not the producer but, 
<A NAME="917"></A>like the Reason-Principles also, an image of its source: that source is 
<A NAME="918"></A>the brilliant, the authentic, the primarily existent, the thing self-sprung 
<A NAME="919"></A>and self-intent; but its image, soul, is a thing which can have no permanence 
<A NAME="920"></A>except by attachment, by living in that other; the very nature of an image 
<A NAME="921"></A>is that, as a secondary, it shall have its being in something else, if 
<A NAME="922"></A>at all it exist apart from its original. Hence this image (soul) has not 
<A NAME="923"></A>vision, for it has not the necessary light, and, if it should see, then, 
<A NAME="924"></A>as finding its completion elsewhere, it sees another, not 
<A NAME="925"></A>itself.
<A NAME="926"></A><BR><BR>In the pure Intellectual there is nothing of this: the vision and 
<A NAME="927"></A>the envisioned are a unity; the seen is as the seeing and seeing as 
<A NAME="928"></A>seen.
<A NAME="929"></A><BR><BR>What, then, is there that can pronounce upon the nature of this 
<A NAME="930"></A>all-unity?
<A NAME="931"></A><BR><BR>That which sees: and to see is the function of the Intellectual-Principle. 
<A NAME="932"></A>Even in our own sphere [we have a parallel to this self-vision of a unity], 
<A NAME="933"></A>our vision is light or rather becomes one with light, and it sees light 
<A NAME="934"></A>for it sees colours. In the intellectual, the vision sees not through some 
<A NAME="935"></A>medium but by and through itself alone, for its object is not external: 
<A NAME="936"></A>by one light it sees another not through any intermediate agency; a light 
<A NAME="937"></A>sees a light, that is to say a thing sees itself. This light shining within 
<A NAME="938"></A>the soul enlightens it; that is, it makes the soul intellective, working 
<A NAME="939"></A>it into likeness with itself, the light above.
<A NAME="940"></A><BR><BR>Think of the traces of this light upon the soul, then say to yourself 
<A NAME="941"></A>that such, and more beautiful and broader and more radiant, is the light 
<A NAME="942"></A>itself; thus you will approach to the nature of the Intellectual-Principle 
<A NAME="943"></A>and the Intellectual Realm, for it is this light, itself lit from above, 
<A NAME="944"></A>which gives the soul its brighter life.
<A NAME="945"></A><BR><BR>It is not the source of the generative life of the soul which, 
<A NAME="946"></A>on the contrary, it draws inward, preserving it from such diffusion, holding 
<A NAME="947"></A>it to the love of the splendour of its Prior.
<A NAME="948"></A><BR><BR>Nor does it give the life of perception and sensation, for that 
<A NAME="949"></A>looks to the external and to what acts most vigorously upon the senses 
<A NAME="950"></A>whereas one accepting that light of truth may be said no longer to see 
<A NAME="951"></A>the visible, but the very contrary.
<A NAME="952"></A><BR><BR>This means in sum that the life the soul takes thence is an intellective 
<A NAME="953"></A>life, a trace of the life in the [divine] Intellect, in which alone the 
<A NAME="954"></A>authentic exists.
<A NAME="955"></A><BR><BR>The life in the Divine Intellect is also an Act: it is the primal 
<A NAME="956"></A>light outlamping to itself primarily, its own torch; light-giver and lit 
<A NAME="957"></A>at once; the authentic intellectual object, knowing at once and known, 
<A NAME="958"></A>seen to itself and needing no other than itself to see by, self-sufficing 
<A NAME="959"></A>to the vision, since what it sees it is; known to us by that very same 
<A NAME="960"></A>light, our knowledge of it attained through itself, for from nowhere else 
<A NAME="961"></A>could we find the means of telling of it. By its nature, its self-vision 
<A NAME="962"></A>is the clearer but, using it as our medium, we too may come to see by 
<A NAME="963"></A>it.
<A NAME="964"></A><BR><BR>In the strength of such considerations we lead up our own soul 
<A NAME="965"></A>to the Divine, so that it poses itself as an image of that Being, its life 
<A NAME="966"></A>becoming an imprint and a likeness of the Highest, its every act of thought 
<A NAME="967"></A>making it over into the Divine and the Intellectual.
<A NAME="968"></A><BR><BR>If the soul is questioned as to the nature of that Intellectual-Principle- 
<A NAME="969"></A>the perfect and all-embracing, the primal self-knower- it has but to enter 
<A NAME="970"></A>into that Principle, or to sink all its activity into that, and at once 
<A NAME="971"></A>it shows itself to be in effective possession of those priors whose memory 
<A NAME="972"></A>it never lost: thus, as an image of the Intellectual-Principle, it can 
<A NAME="973"></A>make itself the medium by which to attain some vision of it; it draws upon 
<A NAME="974"></A>that within itself which is most closely resemblant, as far as resemblance 
<A NAME="975"></A>is possible between divine Intellect and any phase of 
<A NAME="976"></A>soul.
<A NAME="977"></A><BR><BR><B>9.</B> In order, then, to know what the Divine Mind is, we must 
<A NAME="978"></A>observe soul and especially its most God-like phase.
<A NAME="979"></A><BR><BR>One certain way to this knowledge is to separate first, the man 
<A NAME="980"></A>from the body- yourself, that is, from your body- next to put aside that 
<A NAME="981"></A>soul which moulded the body, and, very earnestly, the system of sense with 
<A NAME="982"></A>desires and impulses and every such futility, all setting definitely towards 
<A NAME="983"></A>the mortal: what is left is the phase of the soul which we have declared 
<A NAME="984"></A>to be an image of the Divine Intellect, retaining some light from that 
<A NAME="985"></A>sun, while it pours downward upon the sphere of magnitudes [that is, of 
<A NAME="986"></A>Matter] the light playing about itself which is generated from its own 
<A NAME="987"></A>nature.
<A NAME="988"></A><BR><BR>Of course we do not pretend that the sun's light [as the analogy 
<A NAME="989"></A>might imply] remains a self-gathered and sun-centred thing: it is at once 
<A NAME="990"></A>outrushing and indwelling; it strikes outward continuously, lap after lap, 
<A NAME="991"></A>until it reaches us upon our earth: we must take it that all the light, 
<A NAME="992"></A>including that which plays about the sun's orb, has travelled; otherwise 
<A NAME="993"></A>we would have a void expanse, that of the space- which is material- next 
<A NAME="994"></A>to the sun's orb. The Soul, on the contrary- a light springing from the 
<A NAME="995"></A>Divine Mind and shining about it- is in closest touch with that source; 
<A NAME="996"></A>it is not in transit but remains centred there, and, in likeness to that 
<A NAME="997"></A>principle, it has no place: the light of the sun is actually in the air, 
<A NAME="998"></A>but the soul is clean of all such contact so that its immunity is patent 
<A NAME="999"></A>to itself and to any other of the same order.
<A NAME="1000"></A><BR><BR>And by its own characteristic act, though not without reasoning 
<A NAME="1001"></A>process, it knows the nature of the Intellectual-Principle which, on its 
<A NAME="1002"></A>side, knows itself without need of reasoning, for it is ever self-present 
<A NAME="1003"></A>whereas we become so by directing our soul towards it; our life is broken 
<A NAME="1004"></A>and there are many lives, but that principle needs no changings of life 
<A NAME="1005"></A>or of things; the lives it brings to being are for others not for itself: 
<A NAME="1006"></A>it cannot need the inferior; nor does it for itself produce the less when 
<A NAME="1007"></A>it possesses or is the all, nor the images when it possesses or is the 
<A NAME="1008"></A>prototype.
<A NAME="1009"></A><BR><BR>Anyone not of the strength to lay hold of the first soul, that 
<A NAME="1010"></A>possessing pure intellection, must grasp that which has to do with our 
<A NAME="1011"></A>ordinary thinking and thence ascend: if even this prove too hard, let him 
<A NAME="1012"></A>turn to account the sensitive phase which carries the ideal forms of the 
<A NAME="1013"></A>less fine degree, that phase which, too, with its powers, is immaterial 
<A NAME="1014"></A>and lies just within the realm of Ideal-principles.
<A NAME="1015"></A><BR><BR>One may even, if it seem necessary, begin as low as the reproductive 
<A NAME="1016"></A>soul and its very production and thence make the ascent, mounting from 
<A NAME="1017"></A>those ultimate ideal principles to the ultimates in the higher sense, that 
<A NAME="1018"></A>is to the primals.
<A NAME="1019"></A><BR><BR><B>10.</B> This matter need not be elaborated at present: it suffices 
<A NAME="1020"></A>to say that if the created were all, these ultimates [the higher] need 
<A NAME="1021"></A>not exist: but the Supreme does include primals, the primals because the 
<A NAME="1022"></A>producers. In other words, there must be, with the made, the making source; 
<A NAME="1023"></A>and, unless these are to be identical, there will be need of some link 
<A NAME="1024"></A>between them. Similarly, this link which is the Intellectual-Principle 
<A NAME="1025"></A>demands yet a Transcendent. If we are asked why this Transcendent also 
<A NAME="1026"></A>should not have self-vision, our answer is that it has no need of vision; 
<A NAME="1027"></A>but this we will discuss later: for the moment we go back, since the question 
<A NAME="1028"></A>at issue is gravely important.
<A NAME="1029"></A><BR><BR>We repeat that the Intellectual-Principle must have, actually has, 
<A NAME="1030"></A>self-vision, firstly because it has multiplicity, next because it exists 
<A NAME="1031"></A>for the external and therefore must be a seeing power, one seeing that 
<A NAME="1032"></A>external; in fact its very essence is vision. Given some external, there 
<A NAME="1033"></A>must be vision; and if there be nothing external the Intellectual-Principle 
<A NAME="1034"></A>[Divine Mind] exists in vain. Unless there is something beyond bare unity, 
<A NAME="1035"></A>there can be no vision: vision must converge with a visible object. And 
<A NAME="1036"></A>this which the seer is to see can be only a multiple, no undistinguishable 
<A NAME="1037"></A>unity; nor could a universal unity find anything upon which to exercise 
<A NAME="1038"></A>any act; all, one and desolate, would be utter stagnation; in so far as 
<A NAME="1039"></A>there is action, there is diversity. If there be no distinctions, what 
<A NAME="1040"></A>is there to do, what direction in which to move? An agent must either act 
<A NAME="1041"></A>upon the extern or be a multiple and so able to act upon itself: making 
<A NAME="1042"></A>no advance towards anything other than itself, it is motionless and where 
<A NAME="1043"></A>it could know only blank fixity it can know nothing.
<A NAME="1044"></A><BR><BR>The intellective power, therefore, when occupied with the intellectual 
<A NAME="1045"></A>act, must be in a state of duality, whether one of the two elements stand 
<A NAME="1046"></A>actually outside or both lie within: the intellectual act will always comport 
<A NAME="1047"></A>diversity as well as the necessary identity, and in the same way its characteristic 
<A NAME="1048"></A>objects [the Ideas] must stand to the Intellectual-Principle as at once 
<A NAME="1049"></A>distinct and identical. This applies equally to the single object; there 
<A NAME="1050"></A>can be no intellection except of something containing separable detail 
<A NAME="1051"></A>and, since the object is a Reason-principle [a discriminated Idea] it has 
<A NAME="1052"></A>the necessary element of multiplicity. The Intellectual-Principle, thus, 
<A NAME="1053"></A>is informed of itself by the fact of being a multiple organ of vision, 
<A NAME="1054"></A>an eye receptive of many illuminated objects. If it had to direct itself 
<A NAME="1055"></A>to a memberless unity, it would be dereasoned: what could it say or know 
<A NAME="1056"></A>of such an object? The self-affirmation of [even] a memberless unity implies 
<A NAME="1057"></A>the repudiation of all that does not enter into the character: in other 
<A NAME="1058"></A>words, it must be multiple as a preliminary to being 
<A NAME="1059"></A>itself.
<A NAME="1060"></A><BR><BR>Then, again, in the assertion "I am this particular thing," either 
<A NAME="1061"></A>the "particular thing" is distinct from the assertor- and there is a false 
<A NAME="1062"></A>statement- or it is included within it, and, at once, multiplicity is asserted: 
<A NAME="1063"></A>otherwise the assertion is "I am what I am," or "I am 
<A NAME="1064"></A>I."
<A NAME="1065"></A><BR><BR>If it be no more than a simple duality able to say "I and that 
<A NAME="1066"></A>other phase," there is already multiplicity, for there is distinction and 
<A NAME="1067"></A>ground of distinction, there is number with all its train of separate 
<A NAME="1068"></A>things.
<A NAME="1069"></A><BR><BR>In sum, then, a knowing principle must handle distinct items: its 
<A NAME="1070"></A>object must, at the moment of cognition, contain diversity; otherwise the 
<A NAME="1071"></A>thing remains unknown; there is mere conjunction, such a contact, without 
<A NAME="1072"></A>affirmation or comprehension, as would precede knowledge, the intellect 
<A NAME="1073"></A>not yet in being, the impinging agent not percipient.
<A NAME="1074"></A><BR><BR>Similarly the knowing principle itself cannot remain simplex, especially 
<A NAME="1075"></A>in the act of self-knowing: all silent though its self-perception be, it 
<A NAME="1076"></A>is dual to itself. Of course it has no need of minute self-handling since 
<A NAME="1077"></A>it has nothing to learn by its intellective act; before it is [effectively] 
<A NAME="1078"></A>Intellect, it holds knowledge of its own content. Knowledge implies desire, 
<A NAME="1079"></A>for it is, so to speak, discovery crowning a search; the utterly undifferentiated 
<A NAME="1080"></A>remains self-centred and makes no enquiry about that self: anything capable 
<A NAME="1081"></A>of analysing its content, must be a manifold.
<A NAME="1082"></A><BR><BR><B>11.</B> Thus the Intellectual-Principle, in the act of knowing 
<A NAME="1083"></A>the Transcendent, is a manifold. It knows the Transcendent in very essence 
<A NAME="1084"></A>but, with all its effort to grasp that prior as a pure unity, it goes forth 
<A NAME="1085"></A>amassing successive impressions, so that, to it, the object becomes multiple: 
<A NAME="1086"></A>thus in its outgoing to its object it is not [fully realised] Intellectual-Principle; 
<A NAME="1087"></A>it is an eye that has not yet seen; in its return it is an eye possessed 
<A NAME="1088"></A>of the multiplicity which it has itself conferred: it sought something 
<A NAME="1089"></A>of which it found the vague presentment within itself; it returned with 
<A NAME="1090"></A>something else, the manifold quality with which it has of its own act invested 
<A NAME="1091"></A>the simplex.
<A NAME="1092"></A><BR><BR>If it had not possessed a previous impression of the Transcendent, 
<A NAME="1093"></A>it could never have grasped it, but this impression, originally of unity, 
<A NAME="1094"></A>becomes an impression of multiplicity; and the Intellectual-Principle, 
<A NAME="1095"></A>in taking cognisance of that multiplicity, knows the Transcendent and so 
<A NAME="1096"></A>is realized as an eye possessed of its vision.
<A NAME="1097"></A><BR><BR>It is now Intellectual-Principle since it actually holds its object, 
<A NAME="1098"></A>and holds it by the act of intellection: before, it was no more than a 
<A NAME="1099"></A>tendance, an eye blank of impression: it was in motion towards the transcendental; 
<A NAME="1100"></A>now that it has attained, it has become Intellectual-Principle henceforth 
<A NAME="1101"></A>absorbed; in virtue of this intellection it holds the character of Intellectual-Principle, 
<A NAME="1102"></A>of Essential Existence and of Intellectual Act where, previously, not possessing 
<A NAME="1103"></A>the Intellectual Object, it was not Intellectual Perception, and, not yet 
<A NAME="1104"></A>having exercised the Intellectual Act, it was not Intellectual-Principle.
<A NAME="1105"></A><BR><BR>The Principle before all these principles is no doubt the first 
<A NAME="1106"></A>principle of the universe, but not as immanent: immanence is not for primal 
<A NAME="1107"></A>sources but for engendering secondaries; that which stands as primal source 
<A NAME="1108"></A>of everything is not a thing but is distinct from all things: it is not, 
<A NAME="1109"></A>then, a member of the total but earlier than all, earlier, thus, than the 
<A NAME="1110"></A>Intellectual-Principle- which in fact envelops the entire train of 
<A NAME="1111"></A>things.
<A NAME="1112"></A><BR><BR>Thus we come, once more, to a Being above the Intellectual-Principle 
<A NAME="1113"></A>and, since the sequent amounts to no less than the All, we recognise, again, 
<A NAME="1114"></A>a Being above the All. This assuredly cannot be one of the things to which 
<A NAME="1115"></A>it is prior. We may not call it "Intellect"; therefore, too, we may not 
<A NAME="1116"></A>call it "the Good," if "the Good" is to be taken in the sense of some one 
<A NAME="1117"></A>member of the universe; if we mean that which precedes the universe of 
<A NAME="1118"></A>things, the name may be allowed.
<A NAME="1119"></A><BR><BR>The Intellectual-Principle is established in multiplicity; its 
<A NAME="1120"></A>intellection, self-sprung though it be, is in the nature of something added 
<A NAME="1121"></A>to it [some accidental dualism] and makes it multiple: the utterly simplex, 
<A NAME="1122"></A>and therefore first of all beings, must, then, transcend the Intellectual-Principle; 
<A NAME="1123"></A>and, obviously, if this had intellection it would no longer transcend the 
<A NAME="1124"></A>Intellectual-Principle but be it, and at once be a multiple.
<A NAME="1125"></A><BR><BR><B>12.</B> But why, after all, should it not be such a manifold 
<A NAME="1126"></A>as long as it remains one substantial existence, having the multiplicity 
<A NAME="1127"></A>not of a compound being but of a unity with a variety of 
<A NAME="1128"></A>activities?
<A NAME="1129"></A><BR><BR>Now, no doubt, if these various activities are not themselves substantial 
<A NAME="1130"></A>existences- but merely manifestations of latent potentiality- there is 
<A NAME="1131"></A>no compound; but, on the other hand, it remains incomplete until its substantial 
<A NAME="1132"></A>existence be expressed in act. If its substantial existence consists in 
<A NAME="1133"></A>its Act, and this Act constitutes multiplicity, then its substantial existence 
<A NAME="1134"></A>will be strictly proportioned to the extent of the multiplicity.
<A NAME="1135"></A><BR><BR>We allow this to be true for the Intellectual-Principle to which 
<A NAME="1136"></A>we have allotted [the multiplicity of] self-knowing; but for the first 
<A NAME="1137"></A>principle of all, never. Before the manifold, there must be The One, that 
<A NAME="1138"></A>from which the manifold rises: in all numerical series, the unit is the 
<A NAME="1139"></A>first.
