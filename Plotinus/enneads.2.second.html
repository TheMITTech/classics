<A NAME="10"></A><B>First Tractate</B>
<A NAME="11"></A><BR><BR><B>ON THE KOSMOS OR ON THE HEAVENLY SYSTEM.</B>
<A NAME="12"></A><BR><BR><B>1.</B> We hold that the ordered universe, in its material mass, 
<A NAME="13"></A>has existed for ever and will for ever endure: but simply to refer this 
<A NAME="14"></A>perdurance to the Will of God, however true an explanation, is utterly 
<A NAME="15"></A>inadequate.
<A NAME="16"></A><BR><BR>The elements of this sphere change; the living beings of earth 
<A NAME="17"></A>pass away; only the Ideal-form [the species] persists: possibly a similar 
<A NAME="18"></A>process obtains in the All.
<A NAME="19"></A><BR><BR>The Will of God is able to cope with the ceaseless flux and escape 
<A NAME="20"></A>of body stuff by ceaselessly reintroducing the known forms in new substances, 
<A NAME="21"></A>thus ensuring perpetuity not to the particular item but to the unity of 
<A NAME="22"></A>idea: now, seeing that objects of this realm possess no more than duration 
<A NAME="23"></A>of form, why should celestial objects, and the celestial system itself, 
<A NAME="24"></A>be distinguished by duration of the particular entity?
<A NAME="25"></A><BR><BR>Let us suppose this persistence to be the result of the all-inclusiveness 
<A NAME="26"></A>of the celestial and universal- with its consequence, the absence of any 
<A NAME="27"></A>outlying matter into which change could take place or which could break 
<A NAME="28"></A>in and destroy.
<A NAME="29"></A><BR><BR>This explanation would, no doubt, safeguard the integrity of the 
<A NAME="30"></A>Whole, of the All; but our sun and the individual being of the other heavenly 
<A NAME="31"></A>bodies would not on these terms be secured in perpetuity: they are parts; 
<A NAME="32"></A>no one of them is in itself the whole, the all; it would still be probable 
<A NAME="33"></A>that theirs is no more than that duration in form which belongs to fire 
<A NAME="34"></A>and such entities.
<A NAME="35"></A><BR><BR>This would apply even to the entire ordered universe itself. For 
<A NAME="36"></A>it is very possible that this too, though not in process of destruction 
<A NAME="37"></A>from outside, might have only formal duration; its parts may be so wearing 
<A NAME="38"></A>each other down as to keep it in a continuous decay while, amid the ceaseless 
<A NAME="39"></A>flux of the Kind constituting its base, an outside power ceaselessly restores 
<A NAME="40"></A>the form: in this way the living All may lie under the same conditions 
<A NAME="41"></A>as man and horse and the rest man and horse persisting but not the individual 
<A NAME="42"></A>of the type.
<A NAME="43"></A><BR><BR>With this, we would have no longer the distinction of one order, 
<A NAME="44"></A>the heavenly system, stable for ever, and another, the earthly, in process 
<A NAME="45"></A>of decay: all would be alike except in the point of time; the celestial 
<A NAME="46"></A>would merely be longer lasting. If, then, we accepted this duration of 
<A NAME="47"></A>type alone as a true account of the All equally with its partial members, 
<A NAME="48"></A>our difficulties would be eased- or indeed we should have no further problem- 
<A NAME="49"></A>once the Will of God were shown to be capable, under these conditions and 
<A NAME="50"></A>by such communication, of sustaining the Universe.
<A NAME="51"></A><BR><BR>But if we are obliged to allow individual persistence to any definite 
<A NAME="52"></A>entity within the Kosmos then, firstly, we must show that the Divine Will 
<A NAME="53"></A>is adequate to make it so; secondly, we have to face the question, What 
<A NAME="54"></A>accounts for some things having individual persistence and others only 
<A NAME="55"></A>the persistence of type? and, thirdly, we ask how the partial entities 
<A NAME="56"></A>of the celestial system hold a real duration which would thus appear possible 
<A NAME="57"></A>to all partial things.
<A NAME="58"></A><BR><BR><B>2.</B> Supposing we accept this view and hold that, while things 
<A NAME="59"></A>below the moon's orb have merely type-persistence, the celestial realm 
<A NAME="60"></A>and all its several members possess individual eternity; it remains to 
<A NAME="61"></A>show how this strict permanence of the individual identity- the actual 
<A NAME="62"></A>item eternally unchangeable- can belong to what is certainly corporeal, 
<A NAME="63"></A>seeing that bodily substance is characteristically a thing of 
<A NAME="64"></A>flux.
<A NAME="65"></A><BR><BR>The theory of bodily flux is held by Plato no less than by the 
<A NAME="66"></A>other philosophers who have dealt with physical matters, and is applied 
<A NAME="67"></A>not only to ordinary bodies but to those, also, of the heavenly 
<A NAME="68"></A>sphere.
<A NAME="69"></A><BR><BR>"How," he asks, "can these corporeal and visible entities continue 
<A NAME="70"></A>eternally unchanged in identity?"- evidently agreeing, in this matter also, 
<A NAME="71"></A>with Herakleitos who maintained that even the sun is perpetually coming 
<A NAME="72"></A>anew into being. To Aristotle there would be no problem; it is only accepting 
<A NAME="73"></A>his theories of a fifth-substance.
<A NAME="74"></A><BR><BR>But to those who reject Aristotle's Quintessence and hold the material 
<A NAME="75"></A>mass of the heavens to consist of the elements underlying the living things 
<A NAME="76"></A>of this sphere, how is individual permanence possible? And the difficulty 
<A NAME="77"></A>is still greater for the parts, for the sun and the heavenly 
<A NAME="78"></A>bodies.
<A NAME="79"></A><BR><BR>Every living thing is a combination of soul and body-kind: the 
<A NAME="80"></A>celestial sphere, therefore, if it is to be everlasting as an individual 
<A NAME="81"></A>entity must be so in virtue either of both these constituents or of one 
<A NAME="82"></A>of them, by the combination of soul and body or by soul only or by body 
<A NAME="83"></A>only.
<A NAME="84"></A><BR><BR>Of course anyone that holds body to be incorruptible secures the 
<A NAME="85"></A>desired permanence at once; no need, then, to call on a soul or on any 
<A NAME="86"></A>perdurable conjunction to account for the continued maintenance of a living 
<A NAME="87"></A>being.
<A NAME="88"></A><BR><BR>But the case is different when one holds that body is, of itself, 
<A NAME="89"></A>perishable and that Soul is the principle of permanence: this view obliges 
<A NAME="90"></A>us to the proof that the character of body is not in itself fatal either 
<A NAME="91"></A>to the coherence or to the lasting stability which are imperative: it must 
<A NAME="92"></A>be shown that the two elements of the union envisaged are not inevitably 
<A NAME="93"></A>hostile, but that on the contrary [in the heavens] even Matter must conduce 
<A NAME="94"></A>to the scheme of the standing result.
<A NAME="95"></A><BR><BR><B>3.</B> We have to ask, that is, how Matter, this entity of ceaseless 
<A NAME="96"></A>flux constituting the physical mass of the universe, could serve towards 
<A NAME="97"></A>the immortality of the Kosmos.
<A NAME="98"></A><BR><BR>And our answer is "Because the flux is not outgoing": where there 
<A NAME="99"></A>is motion within but not outwards and the total remains unchanged, there 
<A NAME="100"></A>is neither growth nor decline, and thus the Kosmos never 
<A NAME="101"></A>ages.
<A NAME="102"></A><BR><BR>We have a parallel in our earth, constant from eternity to pattern 
<A NAME="103"></A>and to mass; the air, too, never fails; and there is always water: all 
<A NAME="104"></A>the changes of these elements leave unchanged the Principle of the total 
<A NAME="105"></A>living thing, our world. In our own constitution, again, there is a ceaseless 
<A NAME="106"></A>shifting of particles- and that with outgoing loss- and yet the individual 
<A NAME="107"></A>persists for a long time: where there is no question of an outside region, 
<A NAME="108"></A>the body-principle cannot clash with soul as against the identity and endless 
<A NAME="109"></A>duration of the living thing.
<A NAME="110"></A><BR><BR>Of these material elements- for example- fire, the keen and swift, 
<A NAME="111"></A>cooperates by its upward tendency as earth by its lingering below; for 
<A NAME="112"></A>we must not imagine that the fire, once it finds itself at the point where 
<A NAME="113"></A>its ascent must stop, settles down as in its appropriate place, no longer 
<A NAME="114"></A>seeking, like all the rest, to expand in both directions. No: but higher 
<A NAME="115"></A>is not possible; lower is repugnant to its Kind; all that remains for it 
<A NAME="116"></A>is to be tractable and, answering to a need of its nature, to be drawn 
<A NAME="117"></A>by the Soul to the activity of life, and so to move to in a glorious place, 
<A NAME="118"></A>in the Soul. Anyone that dreads its falling may take heart; the circuit 
<A NAME="119"></A>of the Soul provides against any declination, embracing, sustaining; and 
<A NAME="120"></A>since fire has of itself no downward tendency it accepts that guiding without 
<A NAME="121"></A>resistance. The partial elements constituting our persons do not suffice 
<A NAME="122"></A>for their own cohesion; once they are brought to human shape, they must 
<A NAME="123"></A>borrow elsewhere if the organism is to be maintained: but in the upper 
<A NAME="124"></A>spheres since there can be no loss by flux no such replenishment is 
<A NAME="125"></A>needed.
<A NAME="126"></A><BR><BR>Suppose such loss, suppose fire extinguished there, then a new 
<A NAME="127"></A>fire must be kindled; so also if such loss by flux could occur in some 
<A NAME="128"></A>of the superiors from which the celestial fire depends, that too must be 
<A NAME="129"></A>replaced: but with such transmutations, while there might be something 
<A NAME="130"></A>continuously similar, there would be, no longer, a Living All abidingly 
<A NAME="131"></A>self-identical.
<A NAME="132"></A><BR><BR><B>4.</B> But matters are involved here which demand specific investigation 
<A NAME="133"></A>and cannot be treated as incidental merely to our present problem. We are 
<A NAME="134"></A>faced with several questions: Is the heavenly system exposed to any such 
<A NAME="135"></A>flux as would occasion the need of some restoration corresponding to nourishment; 
<A NAME="136"></A>or do its members, once set in their due places, suffer no loss of substance, 
<A NAME="137"></A>permanent by Kind? Does it consist of fire only, or is it mainly of fire 
<A NAME="138"></A>with the other elements, as well, taken up and carried in the circuit by 
<A NAME="139"></A>the dominant Principle?
<A NAME="140"></A><BR><BR>Our doctrine of the immortality of the heavenly system rests on 
<A NAME="141"></A>the firmest foundation once we have cited the sovereign agent, the soul, 
<A NAME="142"></A>and considered, besides, the peculiar excellence of the bodily substance 
<A NAME="143"></A>constituting the stars, a material so pure, so entirely the noblest, and 
<A NAME="144"></A>chosen by the soul as, in all living beings, the determining principle 
<A NAME="145"></A>appropriates to itself the choicest among their characteristic parts. No 
<A NAME="146"></A>doubt Aristotle is right in speaking of flame as a turmoil, fire insolently 
<A NAME="147"></A>rioting; but the celestial fire is equable, placid, docile to the purposes 
<A NAME="148"></A>of the stars.
<A NAME="149"></A><BR><BR>Still, the great argument remains, the Soul, moving in its marvellous 
<A NAME="150"></A>might second only to the very loftiest Existents: how could anything once 
<A NAME="151"></A>placed within this Soul break away from it into non-being? No one that 
<A NAME="152"></A>understands this principle, the support of all things, can fail to see 
<A NAME="153"></A>that, sprung from God, it is a stronger stay than any 
<A NAME="154"></A>bonds.
<A NAME="155"></A><BR><BR>And is it conceivable that the Soul, valid to sustain for a certain 
<A NAME="156"></A>space of time, could not so sustain for ever? This would be to assume that 
<A NAME="157"></A>it holds things together by violence; that there is a "natural course" 
<A NAME="158"></A>at variance with what actually exists in the nature of the universe and 
<A NAME="159"></A>in these exquisitely ordered beings; and that there is some power able 
<A NAME="160"></A>to storm the established system and destroy its ordered coherence, some 
<A NAME="161"></A>kingdom or dominion that may shatter the order founded by the 
<A NAME="162"></A>Soul.
<A NAME="163"></A><BR><BR>Further: The Kosmos has had no beginning- the impossibility has 
<A NAME="164"></A>been shown elsewhere- and this is warrant for its continued existence. 
<A NAME="165"></A>Why should there be in the future a change that has not yet occurred? The 
<A NAME="166"></A>elements there are not worn away like beams and rafters: they hold sound 
<A NAME="167"></A>for ever, and so the All holds sound. And even supposing these elements 
<A NAME="168"></A>to be in ceaseless transmutation, yet the All persists: the ground of all 
<A NAME="169"></A>the change must itself be changeless.
<A NAME="170"></A><BR><BR>As to any alteration of purpose in the Soul we have already shown 
<A NAME="171"></A>the emptiness of that fancy: the administration of the universe entails 
<A NAME="172"></A>neither labour nor loss; and, even supposing the possibility of annihilating 
<A NAME="173"></A>all that is material, the Soul would be no whit the better or the 
<A NAME="174"></A>worse.
<A NAME="175"></A><BR><BR><B>5.</B> But how explain the permanence There, while the content 
<A NAME="176"></A>of this sphere- its elements and its living things alike- are 
<A NAME="177"></A>passing?
<A NAME="178"></A><BR><BR>The reason is given by Plato: the celestial order is from God, 
<A NAME="179"></A>the living things of earth from the gods sprung from God; and it is law 
<A NAME="180"></A>that the offspring of God endures.
<A NAME="181"></A><BR><BR>In other words, the celestial soul- and our souls with it- springs 
<A NAME="182"></A>directly next from the Creator, while the animal life of this earth is 
<A NAME="183"></A>produced by an image which goes forth from that celestial soul and may 
<A NAME="184"></A>be said to flow downwards from it.
<A NAME="185"></A><BR><BR>A soul, then, of the minor degree- reproducing, indeed, that of 
<A NAME="186"></A>the Divine sphere but lacking in power inasmuch as it must exercise its 
<A NAME="187"></A>creative act upon inferior stuff in an inferior region- the substances 
<A NAME="188"></A>taken up into the fabric being of themselves repugnant to duration; with 
<A NAME="189"></A>such an origin the living things of this realm cannot be of strength to 
<A NAME="190"></A>last for ever; the material constituents are not as firmly held and controlled 
<A NAME="191"></A>as if they were ruled immediately by a Principle of higher 
<A NAME="192"></A>potency.
<A NAME="193"></A><BR><BR>The heavens, on the contrary, must have persistence as a whole, 
<A NAME="194"></A>and this entails the persistence of the parts, of the stars they contain: 
<A NAME="195"></A>we could not imagine that whole to endure with the parts in flux- though, 
<A NAME="196"></A>of course, we must distinguish things sub-celestial from the heavens themselves 
<A NAME="197"></A>whose region does not in fact extend so low as to the 
<A NAME="198"></A>moon.
<A NAME="199"></A><BR><BR>Our own case is different: physically we are formed by that [inferior] 
<A NAME="200"></A>soul, given forth [not directly from God but] from the divine beings in 
<A NAME="201"></A>the heavens and from the heavens themselves; it is by way of that inferior 
<A NAME="202"></A>soul that we are associated with the body [which therefore will not be 
<A NAME="203"></A>persistent]; for the higher soul which constitutes the We is the principle 
<A NAME="204"></A>not of our existence but of our excellence or, if also of our existence, 
<A NAME="205"></A>then only in the sense that, when the body is already constituted, it enters, 
<A NAME="206"></A>bringing with it some effluence from the Divine Reason in support of the 
<A NAME="207"></A>existence.
<A NAME="208"></A><BR><BR><B>6.</B> We may now consider the question whether fire is the 
<A NAME="209"></A>sole element existing in that celestial realm and whether there is any 
<A NAME="210"></A>outgoing thence with the consequent need of renewal.
<A NAME="211"></A><BR><BR>Timaeus pronounced the material frame of the All to consist primarily 
<A NAME="212"></A>of earth and fire for visibility, earth for solidity- and deduced that 
<A NAME="213"></A>the stars must be mainly composed of fire, but not solely since there is 
<A NAME="214"></A>no doubt they are solid.
<A NAME="215"></A><BR><BR>And this is probably a true account. Plato accepts it as indicated 
<A NAME="216"></A>by all the appearances. And, in fact, to all our perception- as we see 
<A NAME="217"></A>them and derive from them the impression of illumination- the stars appear 
<A NAME="218"></A>to be mostly, if not exclusively, fire: but on reasoning into the matter 
<A NAME="219"></A>we judge that since solidity cannot exist apart from earth-matter, they 
<A NAME="220"></A>must contain earth as well.
<A NAME="221"></A><BR><BR>But what place could there be for the other elements? It is impossible 
<A NAME="222"></A>to imagine water amid so vast a conflagration; and if air were present 
<A NAME="223"></A>it would be continually changing into fire.
<A NAME="224"></A><BR><BR>Admitting [with Timaeus; as a logical truth] that two self-contained 
<A NAME="225"></A>entities, standing as extremes to each other need for their coherence two 
<A NAME="226"></A>intermediaries; we may still question whether this holds good with regard 
<A NAME="227"></A>to physical bodies. Certainly water and earth can be mixed without any 
<A NAME="228"></A>such intermediate. It might seem valid to object that the intermediates 
<A NAME="229"></A>are already present in the earth and the water; but a possible answer would 
<A NAME="230"></A>be, "Yes, but not as agents whose meeting is necessary to the coherence 
<A NAME="231"></A>of those extremes."
<A NAME="232"></A><BR><BR>None the less we will take it that the coherence of extremes is 
<A NAME="233"></A>produced by virtue of each possessing all the intermediates. It is still 
<A NAME="234"></A>not proven that fire is necessary to the visibility of earth and earth 
<A NAME="235"></A>to the solidarity of fire.
<A NAME="236"></A><BR><BR>On this principle, nothing possesses an essential-nature of its 
<A NAME="237"></A>very own; every several thing is a blend, and its name is merely an indication 
<A NAME="238"></A>of the dominant constituent.
<A NAME="239"></A><BR><BR>Thus we are told that earth cannot have concrete existence without 
<A NAME="240"></A>the help of some moist element- the moisture in water being the necessary 
<A NAME="241"></A>adhesive- but admitting that we so find it, there is still a contradiction 
<A NAME="242"></A>in pretending that any one element has a being of its own and in the same 
<A NAME="243"></A>breath denying its self-coherence, making its subsistence depend upon others, 
<A NAME="244"></A>and so, in reality, reducing the specific element to nothing. How can we 
<A NAME="245"></A>talk of the existence of the definite Kind, earth- earth essential- if 
<A NAME="246"></A>there exists no single particle of earth which actually is earth without 
<A NAME="247"></A>any need of water to secure its self-cohesion? What has such an adhesive 
<A NAME="248"></A>to act upon if there is absolutely no given magnitude of real earth to 
<A NAME="249"></A>which it may bind particle after particle in its business of producing 
<A NAME="250"></A>the continuous mass? If there is any such given magnitude, large or small, 
<A NAME="251"></A>of pure earth, then earth can exist in its own nature, independently of 
<A NAME="252"></A>water: if there is no such primary particle of pure earth, then there is 
<A NAME="253"></A>nothing whatever for the water to bind. As for air- air unchanged, retaining 
<A NAME="254"></A>its distinctive quality- how could it conduce to the subsistence of a dense 
<A NAME="255"></A>material like earth?
<A NAME="256"></A><BR><BR>Similarly with fire. No doubt Timaeus speaks of it as necessary 
<A NAME="257"></A>not to the existence but to the visibility of earth and the other elements; 
<A NAME="258"></A>and certainly light is essential to all visibility- we cannot say that 
<A NAME="259"></A>we see darkness, which implies, precisely, that nothing is seen, as silence 
<A NAME="260"></A>means nothing being heard.
<A NAME="261"></A><BR><BR>But all this does not assure us that the earth to be visible must 
<A NAME="262"></A>contain fire: light is sufficient: snow, for example, and other extremely 
<A NAME="263"></A>cold substances gleam without the presence of fire- though of course it 
<A NAME="264"></A>might be said that fire was once there and communicated colour before 
<A NAME="265"></A>disappearing.
<A NAME="266"></A><BR><BR>As to the composition of water, we must leave it an open question 
<A NAME="267"></A>whether there can be such a thing as water without a certain proportion 
<A NAME="268"></A>of earth.
<A NAME="269"></A><BR><BR>But how can air, the yielding element, contain 
<A NAME="270"></A>earth?
<A NAME="271"></A><BR>Fire, again: is earth perhaps necessary there since fire is by its 
<A NAME="272"></A>own nature devoid of continuity and not a thing of three 
<A NAME="273"></A>dimensions?
<A NAME="274"></A><BR><BR>Supposing it does not possess the solidity of the three dimensions, 
<A NAME="275"></A>it has that of its thrust; now, cannot this belong to it by the mere right 
<A NAME="276"></A>and fact of its being one of the corporeal entities in nature? Hardness 
<A NAME="277"></A>is another matter, a property confined to earth-stuff. Remember that gold- 
<A NAME="278"></A>which is water- becomes dense by the accession not of earth but of denseness 
<A NAME="279"></A>or consolidation: in the same way fire, with Soul present within it, may 
<A NAME="280"></A>consolidate itself upon the power of the Soul; and there are living beings 
<A NAME="281"></A>of fire among the Celestials.
<A NAME="282"></A><BR><BR>But, in sum, do we abandon the teaching that all the elements enter 
<A NAME="283"></A>into the composition of every living thing?
<A NAME="284"></A><BR><BR>For this sphere, no; but to lift clay into the heavens is against 
<A NAME="285"></A>nature, contrary to the laws of her ordaining: it is difficult, too, to 
<A NAME="286"></A>think of that swiftest of circuits bearing along earthly bodies in its 
<A NAME="287"></A>course nor could such material conduce to the splendour and white glint 
<A NAME="288"></A>of the celestial fire.
<A NAME="289"></A><BR><BR><B>7.</B> We can scarcely do better, in fine, than follow 
<A NAME="290"></A>Plato.
<A NAME="291"></A><BR>Thus:
<A NAME="292"></A><BR>In the universe as a whole there must necessarily be such a degree 
<A NAME="293"></A>of solidity, that is to say, of resistance, as will ensure that the earth, 
<A NAME="294"></A>set in the centre, be a sure footing and support to the living beings moving 
<A NAME="295"></A>over it, and inevitably communicate something of its own density to them: 
<A NAME="296"></A>the earth will possess coherence by its own unaided quality, but visibility 
<A NAME="297"></A>by the presence of fire: it will contain water against the dryness which 
<A NAME="298"></A>would prevent the cohesion of its particles; it will hold air to lighten 
<A NAME="299"></A>its bulky matters; it will be in contact with the celestial fire- not as 
<A NAME="300"></A>being a member of the sidereal system but by the simple fact that the fire 
<A NAME="301"></A>there and our earth both belong to the ordered universe so that something 
<A NAME="302"></A>of the earth is taken up by the fire as something of the fire by the earth 
<A NAME="303"></A>and something of everything by everything else.
<A NAME="304"></A><BR><BR>This borrowing, however, does not mean that the one thing taking-up 
<A NAME="305"></A>from the other enters into a composition, becoming an element in a total 
<A NAME="306"></A>of both: it is simply a consequence of the kosmic fellowship; the participant 
<A NAME="307"></A>retains its own being and takes over not the thing itself but some property 
<A NAME="308"></A>of the thing, not air but air's yielding softness, not fire but fire's 
<A NAME="309"></A>incandescence: mixing is another process, a complete surrender with a resultant 
<A NAME="310"></A>compound not, as in this case, earth- remaining earth, the solidity and 
<A NAME="311"></A>density we know- with something of fire's qualities 
<A NAME="312"></A>superadded.
<A NAME="313"></A><BR><BR>We have authority for this where we read:
<A NAME="314"></A><BR>"At the second circuit from the earth, God kindled a light": he is 
<A NAME="315"></A>speaking of the sun which, elsewhere, he calls the all-glowing and, again, 
<A NAME="316"></A>the all-gleaming: thus he prevents us imagining it to be anything else 
<A NAME="317"></A>but fire, though of a peculiar kind; in other words it is light, which 
<A NAME="318"></A>he distinguishes from flame as being only modestly warm: this light is 
<A NAME="319"></A>a corporeal substance but from it there shines forth that other "light" 
<A NAME="320"></A>which, though it carries the same name, we pronounce incorporeal, given 
<A NAME="321"></A>forth from the first as its flower and radiance, the veritable "incandescent 
<A NAME="322"></A>body." Plato's word earthy is commonly taken in too depreciatory a sense: 
<A NAME="323"></A>he is thinking of earth as the principle of solidity; we are apt to ignore 
<A NAME="324"></A>his distinctions and think of the concrete clay.
<A NAME="325"></A><BR><BR>Fire of this order, giving forth this purest light, belongs to 
<A NAME="326"></A>the upper realm, and there its seat is fixed by nature; but we must not, 
<A NAME="327"></A>on that account, suppose the flame of earth to be associated with the beings 
<A NAME="328"></A>of that higher sphere.
<A NAME="329"></A><BR><BR>No: the flame of this world, once it has attained a certain height, 
<A NAME="330"></A>is extinguished by the currents of air opposed to it. Moreover, as it carries 
<A NAME="331"></A>an earthy element on its upward path, it is weighed downwards and cannot 
<A NAME="332"></A>reach those loftier regions. It comes to a stand somewhere below the moon- 
<A NAME="333"></A>making the air at that point subtler- and its flame, if any flame can persist, 
<A NAME="334"></A>is subdued and softened, and no longer retains its first intensity, but 
<A NAME="335"></A>gives out only what radiance it reflects from the light 
<A NAME="336"></A>above.
<A NAME="337"></A><BR><BR>And it is that loftier light- falling variously upon the stars; 
<A NAME="338"></A>to each in a certain proportion- that gives them their characteristic differences, 
<A NAME="339"></A>as well in magnitude as in colour; just such light constitutes also the 
<A NAME="340"></A>still higher heavenly bodies which, however, like clear air, are invisible 
<A NAME="341"></A>because of the subtle texture and unresisting transparency of their material 
<A NAME="342"></A>substance and also by their very distance.
<A NAME="343"></A><BR><BR><B>8.</B> Now: given a light of this degree, remaining in the upper 
<A NAME="344"></A>sphere at its appointed station, pure light in purest place, what mode 
<A NAME="345"></A>of outflow from it can be conceived possible?
<A NAME="346"></A><BR><BR>Such a Kind is not so constituted as to flow downwards of its own 
<A NAME="347"></A>accord; and there exists in those regions no power to force it down. Again, 
<A NAME="348"></A>body in contact with soul must always be very different from body left 
<A NAME="349"></A>to itself; the bodily substance of the heavens has that contact and will 
<A NAME="350"></A>show that difference.
<A NAME="351"></A><BR><BR>Besides, the corporeal substance nearest to the heavens would be 
<A NAME="352"></A>air or fire: air has no destructive quality; fire would be powerless there 
<A NAME="353"></A>since it could not enter into effective contact: in its very rush it would 
<A NAME="354"></A>change before its attack could be felt; and, apart from that, it is of 
<A NAME="355"></A>the lesser order, no match for what it would be opposing in those higher 
<A NAME="356"></A>regions.
<A NAME="357"></A><BR><BR>Again, fire acts by imparting heat: now it cannot be the source 
<A NAME="358"></A>of heat to what is already hot by nature; and anything it is to destroy 
<A NAME="359"></A>must as a first condition be heated by it, must be brought to a pitch of 
<A NAME="360"></A>heat fatal to the nature concerned.
<A NAME="361"></A><BR><BR>In sum, then, no outside body is necessary to the heavens to ensure 
<A NAME="362"></A>their permanence- or to produce their circular movement, for it has never 
<A NAME="363"></A>been shown that their natural path would be the straight line; on the contrary 
<A NAME="364"></A>the heavens, by their nature, will either be motionless or move by circle; 
<A NAME="365"></A>all other movement indicates outside compulsion. We cannot think, therefore, 
<A NAME="366"></A>that the heavenly bodies stand in need of replenishment; we must not argue 
<A NAME="367"></A>from earthly frames to those of the celestial system whose sustaining soul 
<A NAME="368"></A>is not the same, whose space is not the same, whose conditions are not 
<A NAME="369"></A>those which make restoration necessary in this realm of composite bodies 
<A NAME="370"></A>always in flux: we must recognise that the changes that take place in bodies 
<A NAME="371"></A>here represent a slipping-away from the being [a phenomenon not incident 
<A NAME="372"></A>to the celestial sphere] and take place at the dictate of a Principle not 
<A NAME="373"></A>dwelling in the higher regions, one not powerful enough to ensure the permanence 
<A NAME="374"></A>of the existences in which it is exhibited, one which in its coming into 
<A NAME="375"></A>being and in its generative act is but an imitation of an antecedent Kind, 
<A NAME="376"></A>and, as we have shown, cannot at every point possess the unchangeable identity 
<A NAME="377"></A>of the Intellectual Realm.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="378"></A><B>Second Tractate</B>

<A NAME="379"></A><BR><BR><B>THE HEAVENLY CIRCUIT.</B>
<A NAME="380"></A><BR><BR><B>1.</B> But whence that circular movement?
<A NAME="381"></A><BR>In imitation of the Intellectual-Principle.
<A NAME="382"></A><BR>And does this movement belong to the material part or to the Soul? 
<A NAME="383"></A>Can we account for it on the ground that the Soul has itself at once for 
<A NAME="384"></A>centre and for the goal to which it must be ceaselessly moving; or that, 
<A NAME="385"></A>being self-centred it is not of unlimited extension [and consequently must 
<A NAME="386"></A>move ceaselessly to be omnipresent], and that its revolution carries the 
<A NAME="387"></A>material mass with it?
<A NAME="388"></A><BR><BR>If the Soul had been the moving power [by any such semi-physical 
<A NAME="389"></A>action] it would be so no longer; it would have accomplished the act of 
<A NAME="390"></A>moving and have brought the universe to rest; there would be an end of 
<A NAME="391"></A>this endless revolution.
<A NAME="392"></A><BR><BR>In fact the Soul must be in repose or at least cannot have spatial 
<A NAME="393"></A>movement; how then, having itself a movement of quite another order, could 
<A NAME="394"></A>it communicate spatial movement?
<A NAME="395"></A><BR><BR>But perhaps the circular movement [of the Kosmos as soul and body] 
<A NAME="396"></A>is not spatial or is spatial not primarily but only 
<A NAME="397"></A>incidentally.
<A NAME="398"></A><BR><BR>What, by this explanation, would be the essential movement of the 
<A NAME="399"></A>kosmic soul?
<A NAME="400"></A><BR><BR>A movement towards itself, the movement of self-awareness, of self-intellection, 
<A NAME="401"></A>of the living of its life, the movement of its reaching to all things so 
<A NAME="402"></A>that nothing shall lie outside of it, nothing anywhere but within its 
<A NAME="403"></A>scope.
<A NAME="404"></A><BR><BR>The dominant in a living thing is what compasses it entirely and 
<A NAME="405"></A>makes it a unity.
<A NAME="406"></A><BR><BR>If the Soul has no motion of any kind, it would not vitally compass 
<A NAME="407"></A>the Kosmos nor would the Kosmos, a thing of body, keep its content alive, 
<A NAME="408"></A>for the life of body is movement.
<A NAME="409"></A><BR><BR>Any spatial motion there is will be limited; it will be not that 
<A NAME="410"></A>of Soul untrammelled but that of a material frame ensouled, an animated 
<A NAME="411"></A>organism; the movement will be partly of body, partly of Soul, the body 
<A NAME="412"></A>tending to the straight line which its nature imposes, the Soul restraining 
<A NAME="413"></A>it; the resultant will be the compromise movement of a thing at once carried 
<A NAME="414"></A>forward and at rest.
<A NAME="415"></A><BR><BR>But supposing that the circular movement is to be attributed to 
<A NAME="416"></A>the body, how is it to be explained, since all body, including fire [which 
<A NAME="417"></A>constitutes the heavens] has straightforward motion?
<A NAME="418"></A><BR><BR>The answer is that forthright movement is maintained only pending 
<A NAME="419"></A>arrival at the place for which the moving thing is destined: where a thing 
<A NAME="420"></A>is ordained to be, there it seeks, of its nature, to come for its rest; 
<A NAME="421"></A>its motion is its tendence to its appointed place.
<A NAME="422"></A><BR><BR>Then, since the fire of the sidereal system has attained its goal, 
<A NAME="423"></A>why does it not stay at rest?
<A NAME="424"></A><BR><BR>Evidently because the very nature of fire is to be mobile: if it 
<A NAME="425"></A>did not take the curve, its straight line would finally fling it outside 
<A NAME="426"></A>the universe: the circular course, then, is imperative.
<A NAME="427"></A><BR><BR>But this would imply an act of providence?
<A NAME="428"></A><BR>Not quite: rather its own act under providence; attaining to that realm, 
<A NAME="429"></A>it must still take the circular course by its indwelling nature; for it 
<A NAME="430"></A>seeks the straight path onwards but finds no further space and is driven 
<A NAME="431"></A>back so that it recoils on the only course left to it: there is nothing 
<A NAME="432"></A>beyond; it has reached the ultimate; it runs its course in the regions 
<A NAME="433"></A>it occupies, itself its own sphere, not destined to come to rest there, 
<A NAME="434"></A>existing to move.
<A NAME="435"></A><BR><BR>Further, the centre of a circle [and therefore of the Kosmos] is 
<A NAME="436"></A>distinctively a point of rest: if the circumference outside were not in 
<A NAME="437"></A>motion, the universe would be no more than one vast centre. And movement 
<A NAME="438"></A>around the centre is all the more to be expected in the case of a living 
<A NAME="439"></A>thing whose nature binds it within a body. Such motion alone can constitute 
<A NAME="440"></A>its impulse towards its centre: it cannot coincide with the centre, for 
<A NAME="441"></A>then there would be no circle; since this may not be, it whirls about it; 
<A NAME="442"></A>so only can it indulge its tendence.
<A NAME="443"></A><BR><BR>If, on the other hand, the Kosmic circuit is due to the Soul, we 
<A NAME="444"></A>are not to think of a painful driving [wearing it down at last]; the soul 
<A NAME="445"></A>does not use violence or in any way thwart nature, for "Nature" is no other 
<A NAME="446"></A>than the custom the All-Soul has established. Omnipresent in its entirety, 
<A NAME="447"></A>incapable of division, the Soul of the universe communicates that quality 
<A NAME="448"></A>of universal presence to the heavens, too, in their degree, the degree, 
<A NAME="449"></A>that is, of pursuing universality and advancing towards 
<A NAME="450"></A>it.
<A NAME="451"></A><BR><BR>If the Soul halted anywhere, there the Kosmos, too, brought so 
<A NAME="452"></A>far, would halt: but the Soul encompasses all, and so the Kosmos moves, 
<A NAME="453"></A>seeking everything.
<A NAME="454"></A><BR><BR>Yet never to attain?
<A NAME="455"></A><BR>On the contrary this very motion is its eternal 
<A NAME="456"></A>attainment.
<A NAME="457"></A><BR>Or, better; the Soul is ceaselessly leading the Kosmos towards itself: 
<A NAME="458"></A>the continuous attraction communicates a continuous movement- not to some 
<A NAME="459"></A>outside space but towards the Soul and in the one sphere with it, not in 
<A NAME="460"></A>the straight line [which would ultimately bring the moving body outside 
<A NAME="461"></A>and below the Soul], but in the curving course in which the moving body 
<A NAME="462"></A>at every stage possesses the Soul that is attracting it and bestowing itself 
<A NAME="463"></A>upon it.
<A NAME="464"></A><BR><BR>If the soul were stationary, that is if [instead of presiding over 
<A NAME="465"></A>a Kosmos] it dwelt wholly and solely in the realm in which every member 
<A NAME="466"></A>is at rest, motion would be unknown; but, since the Soul is not fixed in 
<A NAME="467"></A>some one station There, the Kosmos must travel to every point in quest 
<A NAME="468"></A>of it, and never outside it: in a circle, therefore.
<A NAME="469"></A><BR><BR><B>2.</B> And what of lower things? [Why have they not this 
<A NAME="470"></A>motion?]
<A NAME="471"></A><BR>[Their case is very different]: the single thing here is not an all 
<A NAME="472"></A>but a part and limited to a given segment of space; that other realm is 
<A NAME="473"></A>all, is space, so to speak, and is subject to no hindrance or control, 
<A NAME="474"></A>for in itself it is all that is.
<A NAME="475"></A><BR><BR>And men?
<A NAME="476"></A><BR>As a self, each is a personal whole, no doubt; but as member of the 
<A NAME="477"></A>universe, each is a partial thing.
<A NAME="478"></A><BR><BR>But if, wherever the circling body be, it possesses the Soul, what 
<A NAME="479"></A>need of the circling?
<A NAME="480"></A><BR><BR>Because everywhere it finds something else besides the Soul [which 
<A NAME="481"></A>it desires to possess alone].
<A NAME="482"></A><BR><BR>The circular movement would be explained, too, if the Soul's power 
<A NAME="483"></A>may be taken as resident at its centre.
<A NAME="484"></A><BR><BR>Here, however, we must distinguish between a centre in reference 
<A NAME="485"></A>to the two different natures, body and Soul.
<A NAME="486"></A><BR><BR>In body, centre is a point of place; in Soul it is a source, the 
<A NAME="487"></A>source of some other nature. The word, which without qualification would 
<A NAME="488"></A>mean the midpoint of a spheric mass, may serve in the double reference; 
<A NAME="489"></A>and, as in a material mass so in the Soul, there must be a centre, that 
<A NAME="490"></A>around which the object, Soul or material mass, revolves.
<A NAME="491"></A><BR><BR>The Soul exists in revolution around God to whom it clings in love, 
<A NAME="492"></A>holding itself to the utmost of its power near to Him as the Being on which 
<A NAME="493"></A>all depends; and since it cannot coincide with God it circles about 
<A NAME="494"></A>Him.
<A NAME="495"></A><BR><BR>Why then do not all souls [i.e., the lower, also, as those of men 
<A NAME="496"></A>and animals] thus circle about the Godhead?
<A NAME="497"></A><BR><BR>Every Soul does in its own rank and place.
<A NAME="498"></A><BR>And why not our very bodies, also?
<A NAME="499"></A><BR>Because the forward path is characteristic of body and because all 
<A NAME="500"></A>the body's impulses are to other ends and because what in us is of this 
<A NAME="501"></A>circling nature is hampered in its motion by the clay it bears with it, 
<A NAME="502"></A>while in the higher realm everything flows on its course, lightly and easily, 
<A NAME="503"></A>with nothing to check it, once there is any principle of motion in it at 
<A NAME="504"></A>all.
<A NAME="505"></A><BR><BR>And it may very well be that even in us the Spirit which dwells 
<A NAME="506"></A>with the Soul does thus circle about the divinity. For since God is omnipresent 
<A NAME="507"></A>the Soul desiring perfect union must take the circular course: God is not 
<A NAME="508"></A>stationed.
<A NAME="509"></A><BR><BR>Similarly Plato attributes to the stars not only the spheric movement 
<A NAME="510"></A>belonging to the universe as a whole but also to each a revolution around 
<A NAME="511"></A>their common centre; each- not by way of thought but by links of natural 
<A NAME="512"></A>necessity- has in its own place taken hold of God and 
<A NAME="513"></A>exults.
<A NAME="514"></A><BR><BR><B>3.</B> The truth may be resumed in this way:
<A NAME="515"></A><BR>There is a lowest power of the Soul, a nearest to earth, and this is 
<A NAME="516"></A>interwoven throughout the entire universe: another phase possesses sensation, 
<A NAME="517"></A>while yet another includes the Reason which is concerned with the objects 
<A NAME="518"></A>of sensation: this higher phase holds itself to the spheres, poised towards 
<A NAME="519"></A>the Above but hovering over the lesser Soul and giving forth to it an effluence 
<A NAME="520"></A>which makes it more intensely vital.
<A NAME="521"></A><BR><BR>The lower Soul is moved by the higher which, besides encircling 
<A NAME="522"></A>and supporting it, actually resides in whatsoever part of it has thrust 
<A NAME="523"></A>upwards and attained the spheres. The lower then, ringed round by the higher 
<A NAME="524"></A>and answering its call, turns and tends towards it; and this upward tension 
<A NAME="525"></A>communicates motion to the material frame in which it is involved: for 
<A NAME="526"></A>if a single point in a spheric mass is in any degree moved, without being 
<A NAME="527"></A>drawn away from the rest, it moves the whole, and the sphere is set in 
<A NAME="528"></A>motion. Something of the same kind happens in the case of our bodies: the 
<A NAME="529"></A>unspatial movement of the Soul- in happiness, for instance, or at the idea 
<A NAME="530"></A>of some pleasant event- sets up a spatial movement in the body: the Soul, 
<A NAME="531"></A>attaining in its own region some good which increases its sense of life, 
<A NAME="532"></A>moves towards what pleases it; and so, by force of the union established 
<A NAME="533"></A>in the order of nature, it moves the body, in the body's region, that is 
<A NAME="534"></A>in space.
<A NAME="535"></A><BR><BR>As for that phase of the Soul in which sensation is vested, it, 
<A NAME="536"></A>too, takes its good from the Supreme above itself and moves, rejoicingly, 
<A NAME="537"></A>in quest of it: and since the object of its desire is everywhere, it too 
<A NAME="538"></A>ranges always through the entire scope of the universe.
<A NAME="539"></A><BR><BR>The Intellectual-Principle has no such progress in any region; 
<A NAME="540"></A>its movement is a stationary act, for it turns upon 
<A NAME="541"></A>itself.
<A NAME="542"></A><BR><BR>And this is why the All, circling as it does, is at the same time 
<A NAME="543"></A>at rest.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="544"></A><B>Third Tractate</B>

<A NAME="545"></A><BR><BR><B>ARE THE STARS CAUSES?</B>
<A NAME="546"></A><BR><BR><B>1.</B> That the circuit of the stars indicates definite events 
<A NAME="547"></A>to come but without being the cause direct of all that happens, has been 
<A NAME="548"></A>elsewhere affirmed, and proved by some modicum of argument: but the subject 
<A NAME="549"></A>demands more precise and detailed investigation for to take the one view 
<A NAME="550"></A>rather than the other is of no small moment.
<A NAME="551"></A><BR><BR>The belief is that the planets in their courses actually produce 
<A NAME="552"></A>not merely such conditions as poverty, wealth, health and sickness but 
<A NAME="553"></A>even ugliness and beauty and, gravest of all, vices and virtue and the 
<A NAME="554"></A>very acts that spring from these qualities, the definite doings of each 
<A NAME="555"></A>moment of virtue or vice. We are to suppose the stars to be annoyed with 
<A NAME="556"></A>men- and upon matters in which men, moulded to what they are by the stars 
<A NAME="557"></A>themselves, can surely do them no wrong.
<A NAME="558"></A><BR><BR>They will be distributing what pass for their good gifts, not out 
<A NAME="559"></A>of kindness towards the recipients but as they themselves are affected 
<A NAME="560"></A>pleasantly or disagreeably at the various points of their course; so that 
<A NAME="561"></A>they must be supposed to change their plans as they stand at their zeniths 
<A NAME="562"></A>or are declining.
<A NAME="563"></A><BR><BR>More absurdly still, some of them are supposed to be malicious 
<A NAME="564"></A>and others to be helpful, and yet the evil stars will bestow favours and 
<A NAME="565"></A>the benevolent act harshly: further, their action alters as they see each 
<A NAME="566"></A>other or not, so that, after all, they possess no definite nature but vary 
<A NAME="567"></A>according to their angles of aspect; a star is kindly when it sees one 
<A NAME="568"></A>of its fellows but changes at sight of another: and there is even a distinction 
<A NAME="569"></A>to be made in the seeing as it occurs in this figure or in that. Lastly, 
<A NAME="570"></A>all acting together, the fused influence is different again from that of 
<A NAME="571"></A>each single star, just as the blending of distinct fluids gives a mixture 
<A NAME="572"></A>unlike any of them.
<A NAME="573"></A><BR><BR>Since these opinions and others of the same order are prevalent, 
<A NAME="574"></A>it will be well to examine them carefully one by one, beginning with the 
<A NAME="575"></A>fundamental question:
<A NAME="576"></A><BR><BR><B>2.</B> Are these planets to be thought of as soulless or 
<A NAME="577"></A>unsouled?
<A NAME="578"></A><BR>Suppose them, first, to be without Soul.
<A NAME="579"></A><BR>In that case they can purvey only heat or cold- if cold from the stars 
<A NAME="580"></A>can be thought of- that is to say, any communication from them will affect 
<A NAME="581"></A>only our bodily nature, since all they have to communicate to us is merely 
<A NAME="582"></A>corporeal. This implies that no considerable change can be caused in the 
<A NAME="583"></A>bodies affected since emanations merely corporeal cannot differ greatly 
<A NAME="584"></A>from star to star, and must, moreover, blend upon earth into one collective 
<A NAME="585"></A>resultant: at most the differences would be such as depend upon local position, 
<A NAME="586"></A>upon nearness or farness with regard to the centre of influence. This reasoning, 
<A NAME="587"></A>of course, is as valid of any cold emanation there may be as of the 
<A NAME="588"></A>warm.
<A NAME="589"></A><BR><BR>Now, what is there in such corporeal action to account for the 
<A NAME="590"></A>various classes and kinds of men, learned and illiterate, scholars as against 
<A NAME="591"></A>orators, musicians as against people of other professions? Can a power 
<A NAME="592"></A>merely physical make rich or poor? Can it bring about such conditions as 
<A NAME="593"></A>in no sense depend upon the interaction of corporeal elements? Could it, 
<A NAME="594"></A>for example, bring a man such and such a brother, father, son, or wife, 
<A NAME="595"></A>give him a stroke of good fortune at a particular moment, or make him generalissimo 
<A NAME="596"></A>or king?
<A NAME="597"></A><BR><BR>Next, suppose the stars to have life and mind and to be effective 
<A NAME="598"></A>by deliberate purpose.
<A NAME="599"></A><BR><BR>In that case, what have they suffered from us that they should, 
<A NAME="600"></A>in free will, do us hurt, they who are established in a divine place, themselves 
<A NAME="601"></A>divine? There is nothing in their nature of what makes men base, nor can 
<A NAME="602"></A>our weal or woe bring them the slightest good or ill.
<A NAME="603"></A><BR><BR><B>3.</B> Possibly, however, they act not by choice but under stress 
<A NAME="604"></A>of their several positions and collective figures?
<A NAME="605"></A><BR><BR>But if position and figure determined their action each several 
<A NAME="606"></A>one would necessarily cause identical effects with every other on entering 
<A NAME="607"></A>any given place or pattern.
<A NAME="608"></A><BR><BR>And that raises the question what effect for good or bad can be 
<A NAME="609"></A>produced upon any one of them by its transit in the parallel of this or 
<A NAME="610"></A>that section of the Zodiac circle- for they are not in the Zodiacal figure 
<A NAME="611"></A>itself but considerably beneath it especially since, whatever point they 
<A NAME="612"></A>touch, they are always in the heavens.
<A NAME="613"></A><BR><BR>It is absurd to think that the particular grouping under which 
<A NAME="614"></A>a star passes can modify either its character or its earthward influences. 
<A NAME="615"></A>And can we imagine it altered by its own progression as it rises, stands 
<A NAME="616"></A>at centre, declines? Exultant when at centre; dejected or enfeebled in 
<A NAME="617"></A>declension; some raging as they rise and growing benignant as they set, 
<A NAME="618"></A>while declension brings out the best in one among them; surely this cannot 
<A NAME="619"></A>be?
<A NAME="620"></A><BR><BR>We must not forget that invariably every star, considered in itself, 
<A NAME="621"></A>is at centre with regard to some one given group and in decline with regard 
<A NAME="622"></A>to another and vice versa; and, very certainly, it is not at once happy 
<A NAME="623"></A>and sad, angry and kindly. There is no reasonable escape in representing 
<A NAME="624"></A>some of them as glad in their setting, others in their rising: they would 
<A NAME="625"></A>still be grieving and glad at one and the same time.
<A NAME="626"></A><BR><BR>Further, why should any distress of theirs work harm to 
<A NAME="627"></A>us?
<A NAME="628"></A><BR>No: we cannot think of them as grieving at all or as being cheerful 
<A NAME="629"></A>upon occasions: they must be continuously serene, happy in the good they 
<A NAME="630"></A>enjoy and the Vision before them. Each lives its own free life; each finds 
<A NAME="631"></A>its Good in its own Act; and this Act is not directed towards 
<A NAME="632"></A>us.
<A NAME="633"></A><BR><BR>Like the birds of augury, the living beings of the heavens, having 
<A NAME="634"></A>no lot or part with us, may serve incidentally to foreshow the future, 
<A NAME="635"></A>but they have absolutely no main function in our regard.
<A NAME="636"></A><BR><BR><B>4.</B> It is again not in reason that a particular star should 
<A NAME="637"></A>be gladdened by seeing this or that other while, in a second couple, such 
<A NAME="638"></A>an aspect is distressing: what enmities can affect such beings? what causes 
<A NAME="639"></A>of enmity can there be among them?
<A NAME="640"></A><BR><BR>And why should there be any difference as a given star sees certain 
<A NAME="641"></A>others from the corner of a triangle or in opposition or at the angle of 
<A NAME="642"></A>a square?
<A NAME="643"></A><BR><BR>Why, again, should it see its fellow from some one given position 
<A NAME="644"></A>and yet, in the next Zodiacal figure, not see it, though the two are actually 
<A NAME="645"></A>nearer?
<A NAME="646"></A><BR><BR>And, the cardinal question; by what conceivable process could they 
<A NAME="647"></A>affect what is attributed to them? How explain either the action of any 
<A NAME="648"></A>single star independently or, still more perplexing, the effect of their 
<A NAME="649"></A>combined intentions?
<A NAME="650"></A><BR><BR>We cannot think of them entering into compromises, each renouncing 
<A NAME="651"></A>something of its efficiency and their final action in our regard amounting 
<A NAME="652"></A>to a concerted plan.
<A NAME="653"></A><BR><BR>No one star would suppress the contribution of another, nor would 
<A NAME="654"></A>star yield to star and shape its conduct under suasion.
<A NAME="655"></A><BR><BR>As for the fancy that while one is glad when it enters another's 
<A NAME="656"></A>region, the second is vexed when in its turn it occupies the place of the 
<A NAME="657"></A>first, surely this is like starting with the supposition of two friends 
<A NAME="658"></A>and then going on to talk of one being attracted to the other who, however, 
<A NAME="659"></A>abhors the first.
<A NAME="660"></A><BR><BR><B>5.</B> When they tell us that a certain cold star is more benevolent 
<A NAME="661"></A>to us in proportion as it is further away, they clearly make its harmful 
<A NAME="662"></A>influence depend upon the coldness of its nature; and yet it ought to be 
<A NAME="663"></A>beneficent to us when it is in the opposed Zodiacal 
<A NAME="664"></A>figures.
<A NAME="665"></A><BR><BR>When the cold planet, we are told, is in opposition to the cold, 
<A NAME="666"></A>both become meanacing: but the natural effect would be a 
<A NAME="667"></A>compromise.
<A NAME="668"></A><BR><BR>And we are asked to believe that one of them is happy by day and 
<A NAME="669"></A>grows kindly under the warmth, while another, of a fiery nature, is most 
<A NAME="670"></A>cheerful by night- as if it were not always day to them, light to them, 
<A NAME="671"></A>and as if the first one could be darkened by night at that great distance 
<A NAME="672"></A>above the earth's shadow.
<A NAME="673"></A><BR><BR>Then there is the notion that the moon, in conjunction with a certain 
<A NAME="674"></A>star, is softened at her full but is malignant in the same conjunction 
<A NAME="675"></A>when her light has waned; yet, if anything of this order could be admitted, 
<A NAME="676"></A>the very opposite would be the case. For when she is full to us she must 
<A NAME="677"></A>be dark on the further hemisphere, that is to that star which stands above 
<A NAME="678"></A>her; and when dark to us she is full to that other star, upon which only 
<A NAME="679"></A>then, on the contrary, does she look with her light. To the moon itself, 
<A NAME="680"></A>in fact, it can make no difference in what aspect she stands, for she is 
<A NAME="681"></A>always lit on the upper or on the under half: to the other star, the warmth 
<A NAME="682"></A>from the moon, of which they speak, might make a difference; but that warmth 
<A NAME="683"></A>would reach it precisely when the moon is without light to us; at its darkest 
<A NAME="684"></A>to us it is full to that other, and therefore beneficent. The darkness 
<A NAME="685"></A>of the moon to us is of moment to the earth, but brings no trouble to the 
<A NAME="686"></A>planet above. That planet, it is alleged, can give no help on account of 
<A NAME="687"></A>its remoteness and therefore seems less well disposed; but the moon at 
<A NAME="688"></A>its full suffices to the lower realm so that the distance of the other 
<A NAME="689"></A>is of no importance. When the moon, though dark to us, is in aspect with 
<A NAME="690"></A>the Fiery Star she is held to be favourable: the reason alleged is that 
<A NAME="691"></A>the force of Mars is all-sufficient since it contains more fire than it 
<A NAME="692"></A>needs.
<A NAME="693"></A><BR><BR>The truth is that while the material emanations from the living 
<A NAME="694"></A>beings of the heavenly system are of various degrees of warmth- planet 
<A NAME="695"></A>differing from planet in this respect- no cold comes from them: the nature 
<A NAME="696"></A>of the space in which they have their being is voucher for 
<A NAME="697"></A>that.
<A NAME="698"></A><BR><BR>The star known as Jupiter includes a due measure of fire [and warmth], 
<A NAME="699"></A>in this resembling the Morning-star and therefore seeming to be in alliance 
<A NAME="700"></A>with it. In aspect with what is known as the Fiery Star, Jupiter is beneficent 
<A NAME="701"></A>by virtue of the mixing of influences: in aspect with Saturn unfriendly 
<A NAME="702"></A>by dint of distance. Mercury, it would seem, is indifferent whatever stars 
<A NAME="703"></A>it be in aspect with; for it adopts any and every character.
<A NAME="704"></A><BR><BR>But all the stars are serviceable to the Universe, and therefore 
<A NAME="705"></A>can stand to each other only as the service of the Universe demands, in 
<A NAME="706"></A>a harmony like that observed in the members of any one animal form. They 
<A NAME="707"></A>exist essentially for the purpose of the Universe, just as the gall exists 
<A NAME="708"></A>for the purposes of the body as a whole not less than for its own immediate 
<A NAME="709"></A>function: it is to be the inciter of the animal spirits but without allowing 
<A NAME="710"></A>the entire organism and its own especial region to run riot. Some such 
<A NAME="711"></A>balance of function was indispensable in the All- bitter with sweet. There 
<A NAME="712"></A>must be differentiation- eyes and so forth- but all the members will be 
<A NAME="713"></A>in sympathy with the entire animal frame to which they belong. Only so 
<A NAME="714"></A>can there be a unity and a total harmony.
<A NAME="715"></A><BR><BR>And in such a total, analogy will make every part a 
<A NAME="716"></A>Sign.
<A NAME="717"></A><BR><B>6.</B> But that this same Mars, or Aphrodite, in certain aspects 
<A NAME="718"></A>should cause adulteries- as if they could thus, through the agency of human 
<A NAME="719"></A>incontinence, satisfy their own mutual desires- is not such a notion the 
<A NAME="720"></A>height of unreason? And who could accept the fancy that their happiness 
<A NAME="721"></A>comes from their seeing each other in this or that relative position and 
<A NAME="722"></A>not from their own settled nature?
<A NAME="723"></A><BR><BR>Again: countless myriads of living beings are born and continue 
<A NAME="724"></A>to be: to minister continuously to every separate one of these; to make 
<A NAME="725"></A>them famous, rich, poor, lascivious; to shape the active tendencies of 
<A NAME="726"></A>every single one- what kind of life is this for the stars, how could they 
<A NAME="727"></A>possibly handle a task so huge?
<A NAME="728"></A><BR><BR>They are to watch, we must suppose, the rising of each several 
<A NAME="729"></A>constellation and upon that signal to act; such a one, they see, has risen 
<A NAME="730"></A>by so many degrees, representing so many of the periods of its upward path; 
<A NAME="731"></A>they reckon on their fingers at what moment they must take the action which, 
<A NAME="732"></A>executed prematurely, would be out of order: and in the sum, there is no 
<A NAME="733"></A>One Being controlling the entire scheme; all is made over to the stars 
<A NAME="734"></A>singly, as if there were no Sovereign Unity, standing as source of all 
<A NAME="735"></A>the forms of Being in subordinate association with it, and delegating to 
<A NAME="736"></A>the separate members, in their appropriate Kinds, the task of accomplishing 
<A NAME="737"></A>its purposes and bringing its latent potentiality into 
<A NAME="738"></A>act.
<A NAME="739"></A><BR><BR>This is a separatist theory, tenable only by minds ignorant of 
<A NAME="740"></A>the nature of a Universe which has a ruling principle and a first cause 
<A NAME="741"></A>operative downwards through every member.
<A NAME="742"></A><BR><BR><B>7.</B> But, if the stars announce the future- as we hold of 
<A NAME="743"></A>many other things also- what explanation of the cause have we to offer? 
<A NAME="744"></A>What explains the purposeful arrangement thus implied? Obviously, unless 
<A NAME="745"></A>the particular is included under some general principle of order, there 
<A NAME="746"></A>can be no signification.
<A NAME="747"></A><BR><BR>We may think of the stars as letters perpetually being inscribed 
<A NAME="748"></A>on the heavens or inscribed once for all and yet moving as they pursue 
<A NAME="749"></A>the other tasks allotted to them: upon these main tasks will follow the 
<A NAME="750"></A>quality of signifying, just as the one principle underlying any living 
<A NAME="751"></A>unit enables us to reason from member to member, so that for example we 
<A NAME="752"></A>may judge of character and even of perils and safeguards by indications 
<A NAME="753"></A>in the eyes or in some other part of the body. If these parts of us are 
<A NAME="754"></A>members of a whole, so are we: in different ways the one law 
<A NAME="755"></A>applies.
<A NAME="756"></A><BR><BR>All teems with symbol; the wise man is the man who in any one thing 
<A NAME="757"></A>can read another, a process familiar to all of us in not a few examples 
<A NAME="758"></A>of everyday experience.
<A NAME="759"></A><BR><BR>But what is the comprehensive principle of co-ordination? Establish 
<A NAME="760"></A>this and we have a reasonable basis for the divination, not only by stars 
<A NAME="761"></A>but also by birds and other animals, from which we derive guidance in our 
<A NAME="762"></A>varied concerns.
<A NAME="763"></A><BR><BR>All things must be enchained; and the sympathy and correspondence 
<A NAME="764"></A>obtaining in any one closely knit organism must exist, first, and most 
<A NAME="765"></A>intensely, in the All. There must be one principle constituting this unit 
<A NAME="766"></A>of many forms of life and enclosing the several members within the unity, 
<A NAME="767"></A>while at the same time, precisely as in each thing of detail the parts 
<A NAME="768"></A>too have each a definite function, so in the All each several member must 
<A NAME="769"></A>have its own task- but more markedly so since in this case the parts are 
<A NAME="770"></A>not merely members but themselves Alls, members of the loftier 
<A NAME="771"></A>Kind.
<A NAME="772"></A><BR><BR>Thus each entity takes its origin from one Principle and, therefore, 
<A NAME="773"></A>while executing its own function, works in with every other member of that 
<A NAME="774"></A>All from which its distinct task has by no means cut it off: each performs 
<A NAME="775"></A>its act, each receives something from the others, every one at its own 
<A NAME="776"></A>moment bringing its touch of sweet or bitter. And there is nothing undesigned, 
<A NAME="777"></A>nothing of chance, in all the process: all is one scheme of differentiation, 
<A NAME="778"></A>starting from the Firsts and working itself out in a continuous progression 
<A NAME="779"></A>of Kinds.
<A NAME="780"></A><BR><BR><B>8.</B> Soul, then, in the same way, is intent upon a task of 
<A NAME="781"></A>its own; alike in its direct course and in its divagation it is the cause 
<A NAME="782"></A>of all by its possession of the Thought of the First Principle: thus a 
<A NAME="783"></A>Law of Justice goes with all that exists in the Universe which, otherwise, 
<A NAME="784"></A>would be dissolved, and is perdurable because the entire fabric is guided 
<A NAME="785"></A>as much by the orderliness as by the power of the controlling force. And 
<A NAME="786"></A>in this order the stars, as being no minor members of the heavenly system, 
<A NAME="787"></A>are co-operators contributing at once to its stately beauty and to its 
<A NAME="788"></A>symbolic quality. Their symbolic power extends to the entire realm of sense, 
<A NAME="789"></A>their efficacy only to what they patently do.
<A NAME="790"></A><BR><BR>For our part, nature keeps us upon the work of the Soul as long 
<A NAME="791"></A>as we are not wrecked in the multiplicity of the Universe: once thus sunk 
<A NAME="792"></A>and held we pay the penalty, which consists both in the fall itself and 
<A NAME="793"></A>in the lower rank thus entailed upon us: riches and poverty are caused 
<A NAME="794"></A>by the combinations of external fact.
<A NAME="795"></A><BR><BR>And what of virtue and vice?
<A NAME="796"></A><BR>That question has been amply discussed elsewhere: in a word, virtue 
<A NAME="797"></A>is ours by the ancient staple of the Soul; vice is due to the commerce 
<A NAME="798"></A>of a Soul with the outer world.
<A NAME="799"></A><BR><BR><B>9.</B> This brings us to the Spindle-destiny, spun according 
<A NAME="800"></A>to the ancients by the Fates. To Plato the Spindle represents the co-operation 
<A NAME="801"></A>of the moving and the stable elements of the kosmic circuit: the Fates 
<A NAME="802"></A>with Necessity, Mother of the Fates, manipulate it and spin at the birth 
<A NAME="803"></A>of every being, so that all comes into existence through 
<A NAME="804"></A>Necessity.
<A NAME="805"></A><BR><BR>In the Timaeus, the creating God bestows the essential of the Soul, 
<A NAME="806"></A>but it is the divinities moving in the kosmos [the stars] that infuse the 
<A NAME="807"></A>powerful affections holding from Necessity our impulse and our desire, 
<A NAME="808"></A>our sense of pleasure and of pain- and that lower phase of the Soul in 
<A NAME="809"></A>which such experiences originate. By this statement our personality is 
<A NAME="810"></A>bound up with the stars, whence our Soul [as total of Principle and affections] 
<A NAME="811"></A>takes shape; and we are set under necessity at our very entrance into the 
<A NAME="812"></A>world: our temperament will be of the stars' ordering, and so, therefore, 
<A NAME="813"></A>the actions which derive from temperament, and all the experiences of a 
<A NAME="814"></A>nature shaped to impressions.
<A NAME="815"></A><BR><BR>What, after all this, remains to stand for the 
<A NAME="816"></A>"We"?
<A NAME="817"></A><BR>The "We" is the actual resultant of a Being whose nature includes, 
<A NAME="818"></A>with certain sensibilities, the power of governing them. Cut off as we 
<A NAME="819"></A>are by the nature of the body, God has yet given us, in the midst of all 
<A NAME="820"></A>this evil, virtue the unconquerable, meaningless in a state of tranquil 
<A NAME="821"></A>safety but everything where its absence would be peril of 
<A NAME="822"></A>fall.
<A NAME="823"></A><BR><BR>Our task, then, is to work for our liberation from this sphere, 
<A NAME="824"></A>severing ourselves from all that has gathered about us; the total man is 
<A NAME="825"></A>to be something better than a body ensouled- the bodily element dominant 
<A NAME="826"></A>with a trace of Soul running through it and a resultant life-course mainly 
<A NAME="827"></A>of the body- for in such a combination all is, in fact, bodily. There is 
<A NAME="828"></A>another life, emancipated, whose quality is progression towards the higher 
<A NAME="829"></A>realm, towards the good and divine, towards that Principle which no one 
<A NAME="830"></A>possesses except by deliberate usage but so may appropriate, becoming, 
<A NAME="831"></A>each personally, the higher, the beautiful, the Godlike, and living, remote, 
<A NAME="832"></A>in and by It- unless one choose to go bereaved of that higher Soul and 
<A NAME="833"></A>therefore, to live fate-bound, no longer profiting, merely, by the significance 
<A NAME="834"></A>of the sidereal system but becoming as it were a part sunken in it and 
<A NAME="835"></A>dragged along with the whole thus adopted.
<A NAME="836"></A><BR><BR>For every human Being is of twofold character; there is that compromise-total 
<A NAME="837"></A>and there is the Authentic Man: and it is so with the Kosmos as a whole; 
<A NAME="838"></A>it is in the one phase a conjunction of body with a certain form of the 
<A NAME="839"></A>Soul bound up in body; in the other phase it is the Universal Soul, that 
<A NAME="840"></A>which is not itself embodied but flashes down its rays into the embodied 
<A NAME="841"></A>Soul: and the same twofold quality belongs to the Sun and the other members 
<A NAME="842"></A>of the heavenly system.
<A NAME="843"></A><BR><BR>To the remoter Soul, the pure, sun and stars communicate no baseness. 
<A NAME="844"></A>In their efficacy upon the [material] All, they act as parts of it, as 
<A NAME="845"></A>ensouled bodies within it; and they act only upon what is partial; body 
<A NAME="846"></A>is the agent while, at the same time, it becomes the vehicle through which 
<A NAME="847"></A>is transmitted something of the star's will and of that authentic Soul 
<A NAME="848"></A>in it which is steadfastly in contemplation of the Highest.
<A NAME="849"></A><BR><BR>But [with every allowance to the lower forces] all follows either 
<A NAME="850"></A>upon that Highest or rather upon the Beings about It- we may think of the 
<A NAME="851"></A>Divine as a fire whose outgoing warmth pervades the Universe- or upon whatsoever 
<A NAME="852"></A>is transmitted by the one Soul [the divine first Soul] to the other, its 
<A NAME="853"></A>Kin [the Soul of any particular being]. All that is graceless is admixture. 
<A NAME="854"></A>For the Universe is in truth a thing of blend, and if we separate from 
<A NAME="855"></A>it that separable Soul, the residue is little. The All is a God when the 
<A NAME="856"></A>divine Soul is counted in with it; "the rest," we read, "is a mighty spirit 
<A NAME="857"></A>and its ways are subdivine."
<A NAME="858"></A><BR><BR><B>10.</B> If all this be true, we must at once admit signification, 
<A NAME="859"></A>though, neither singly nor collectively, can we ascribe to the stars any 
<A NAME="860"></A>efficacy except in what concerns the [material] All and in what is of their 
<A NAME="861"></A>own function.
<A NAME="862"></A><BR><BR>We must admit that the Soul before entering into birth presents 
<A NAME="863"></A>itself bearing with it something of its own, for it could never touch body 
<A NAME="864"></A>except under stress of a powerful inner impulse; we must admit some element 
<A NAME="865"></A>of chance around it from its very entry, since the moment and conditions 
<A NAME="866"></A>are determined by the kosmic circuit: and we must admit some effective 
<A NAME="867"></A>power in that circuit itself; it is co-operative, and completes of its 
<A NAME="868"></A>own act the task that belongs to the All of which everything in the circuit 
<A NAME="869"></A>takes the rank and function of a part.
<A NAME="870"></A><BR><BR><B>11.</B> And we must remember that what comes from the supernals 
<A NAME="871"></A>does not enter into the recipients as it left the source; fire, for instance, 
<A NAME="872"></A>will be duller; the loving instinct will degenerate and issue in ugly forms 
<A NAME="873"></A>of the passion; the vital energy in a subject not so balanced as to display 
<A NAME="874"></A>the mean of manly courage, will come out as either ferocity or faint-heartedness; 
<A NAME="875"></A>and ambition... in love...; and the instinct towards good sets up the pursuit 
<A NAME="876"></A>of semblant beauty; intellectual power at its lowest produces the extreme 
<A NAME="877"></A>of wickedness, for wickedness is a miscalculating effort towards 
<A NAME="878"></A>Intelligence.
<A NAME="879"></A><BR><BR>Any such quality, modified at best from its supreme form, deteriorates 
<A NAME="880"></A>again within itself: things of any kind that approach from above, altered 
<A NAME="881"></A>by merely leaving their source change further still by their blending with 
<A NAME="882"></A>bodies, with Matter, with each other.
<A NAME="883"></A><BR><BR><B>12.</B> All that thus proceeds from the supernal combines into 
<A NAME="884"></A>a unity and every existing entity takes something from this blended infusion 
<A NAME="885"></A>so that the result is the thing itself plus some quality. The effluence 
<A NAME="886"></A>does not make the horse but adds something to it; for horse comes by horse, 
<A NAME="887"></A>and man by man: the sun plays its part no doubt in the shaping, but the 
<A NAME="888"></A>man has his origin in the Human-Principle. Outer things have their effect, 
<A NAME="889"></A>sometimes to hurt and sometimes to help; like a father, they often contribute 
<A NAME="890"></A>to good but sometimes also to harm; but they do not wrench the human being 
<A NAME="891"></A>from the foundations of its nature; though sometimes Matter is the dominant, 
<A NAME="892"></A>and the human principle takes the second place so that there is a failure 
<A NAME="893"></A>to achieve perfection; the Ideal has been attenuated.
<A NAME="894"></A><BR><BR><B>13.</B> Of phenomena of this sphere some derive from the Kosmic 
<A NAME="895"></A>Circuit and some not: we must take them singly and mark them off, assigning 
<A NAME="896"></A>to each its origin.
<A NAME="897"></A><BR><BR>The gist of the whole matter lies in the consideration that Soul 
<A NAME="898"></A>governs this All by the plan contained in the Reason-Principle and plays 
<A NAME="899"></A>in the All exactly the part of the particular principle which in every 
<A NAME="900"></A>living-thing forms the members of the organism and adjusts them to the 
<A NAME="901"></A>unity of which they are portions; the entire force of the Soul is represented 
<A NAME="902"></A>in the All, but, in the parts, Soul is present only in proportion to the 
<A NAME="903"></A>degree of essential reality held by each of such partial objects. Surrounding 
<A NAME="904"></A>every separate entity there are other entities, whose approach will sometimes 
<A NAME="905"></A>be hostile and sometimes helpful to the purpose of its nature; but to the 
<A NAME="906"></A>All taken in its length and breadth each and every separate existent is 
<A NAME="907"></A>an adjusted part, holding its own characteristic and yet contributing by 
<A NAME="908"></A>its own native tendency to the entire life-history of the 
<A NAME="909"></A>Universe.
<A NAME="910"></A><BR><BR>The soulless parts of the All are merely instruments; all their 
<A NAME="911"></A>action is effected, so to speak, under a compulsion from outside 
<A NAME="912"></A>themselves.
<A NAME="913"></A><BR><BR>The ensouled fall into two classes. The one kind has a motion of 
<A NAME="914"></A>its own, but haphazard like that of horses between the shafts but before 
<A NAME="915"></A>their driver sets the course; they are set right by the whip. In the Living-Being 
<A NAME="916"></A>possessed of Reason, the nature-principle includes the driver; where the 
<A NAME="917"></A>driver is intelligent, it takes in the main a straight path to a set end. 
<A NAME="918"></A>But both classes are members of the All and co-operate towards the general 
<A NAME="919"></A>purpose.
<A NAME="920"></A><BR><BR>The greater and most valuable among them have an important operation 
<A NAME="921"></A>over a wide range: their contribution towards the life of the whole consists 
<A NAME="922"></A>in acting, not in being acted upon; others, but feebly equipped for action, 
<A NAME="923"></A>are almost wholly passive; there is an intermediate order whose members 
<A NAME="924"></A>contain within themselves a principle of productivity and activity and 
<A NAME="925"></A>make themselves very effective in many spheres or ways and yet serve also 
<A NAME="926"></A>by their passivity.
<A NAME="927"></A><BR><BR>Thus the All stands as one all-complete Life, whose members, to 
<A NAME="928"></A>the measure in which each contains within itself the Highest, effect all 
<A NAME="929"></A>that is high and noble: and the entire scheme must be subordinate to its 
<A NAME="930"></A>Dirigeant as an army to its general, "following upon Zeus"- it has been 
<A NAME="931"></A>said- "as he proceeds towards the Intelligible Kind."
<A NAME="932"></A><BR><BR>Secondary in the All are those of its parts which possess a less 
<A NAME="933"></A>exalted nature just as in us the members rank lower than the Soul; and 
<A NAME="934"></A>so all through, there is a general analogy between the things of the All 
<A NAME="935"></A>and our own members- none of quite equal rank.
<A NAME="936"></A><BR><BR>All living things, then- all in the heavens and all elsewhere- 
<A NAME="937"></A>fall under the general Reason-Principle of the All- they have been made 
<A NAME="938"></A>parts with a view to the whole: not one of these parts, however exalted, 
<A NAME="939"></A>has power to effect any alteration of these Reason-Principles or of things 
<A NAME="940"></A>shaped by them and to them; some modification one part may work upon another, 
<A NAME="941"></A>whether for better or for worse; but there is no power that can wrest anything 
<A NAME="942"></A>outside of its distinct nature.
<A NAME="943"></A><BR><BR>The part effecting such a modification for the worse may act in 
<A NAME="944"></A>several ways.
<A NAME="945"></A><BR><BR>It may set up some weakness restricted to the material frame. Or 
<A NAME="946"></A>it may carry the weakness through to the sympathetic Soul which by the 
<A NAME="947"></A>medium of the material frame, become a power to debasement, has been delivered 
<A NAME="948"></A>over, though never in its essence, to the inferior order of being. Or, 
<A NAME="949"></A>in the case of a material frame ill-organized, it may check all such action 
<A NAME="950"></A>[of the Soul] upon the material frame as demands a certain collaboration 
<A NAME="951"></A>in the part acted upon: thus a lyre may be so ill-strung as to be incapable 
<A NAME="952"></A>of the melodic exactitude necessary to musical effect.
<A NAME="953"></A><BR><BR><B>14.</B> What of poverty and riches, glory and 
<A NAME="954"></A>power?
<A NAME="955"></A><BR>In the case of inherited fortune, the stars merely announce a rich 
<A NAME="956"></A>man, exactly as they announce the high social standing of the child born 
<A NAME="957"></A>to a distinguished house.
<A NAME="958"></A><BR><BR>Wealth may be due to personal activity: in this case if the body 
<A NAME="959"></A>has contributed, part of the effect is due to whatever has contributed 
<A NAME="960"></A>towards the physical powers, first the parents and then, if place has had 
<A NAME="961"></A>its influence, sky and earth; if the body has borne no part of the burden, 
<A NAME="962"></A>then the success, and all the splendid accompaniments added by the Recompensers, 
<A NAME="963"></A>must be attributed to virtue exclusively. If fortune has come by gift from 
<A NAME="964"></A>the good, then the source of the wealth is, again, virtue: if by gift from 
<A NAME="965"></A>the evil, but to a meritorious recipient, then the credit must be given 
<A NAME="966"></A>to the action of the best in them: if the recipient is himself unprincipled, 
<A NAME="967"></A>the wealth must be attributed primarily to the very wickedness and to whatsoever 
<A NAME="968"></A>is responsible for the wickedness, while the givers bear an equal share 
<A NAME="969"></A>in the wrong.
<A NAME="970"></A><BR><BR>When the success is due to labour, tillage for example, it must 
<A NAME="971"></A>be put down to the tiller, with all his environment as contributory. In 
<A NAME="972"></A>the case of treasure-trove, something from the All has entered into action; 
<A NAME="973"></A>and if this be so, it will be foreshown- since all things make a chain, 
<A NAME="974"></A>so that we can speak of things universally. Money is lost: if by robbery, 
<A NAME="975"></A>the blame lies with the robber and the native principle guiding him: if 
<A NAME="976"></A>by shipwreck, the cause is the chain of events. As for good fame, it is 
<A NAME="977"></A>either deserved and then is due to the services done and to the merit of 
<A NAME="978"></A>those appraising them, or it is undeserved, and then must be attributed 
<A NAME="979"></A>to the injustice of those making the award. And the same principle holds 
<A NAME="980"></A>is regards power- for this also may be rightly or unrightly placed- it 
<A NAME="981"></A>depends either upon the merit of the dispensers of place or upon the man 
<A NAME="982"></A>himself who has effected his purpose by the organization of supporters 
<A NAME="983"></A>or in many other possible ways. Marriages, similarly, are brought about 
<A NAME="984"></A>either by choice or by chance interplay of circumstance. And births are 
<A NAME="985"></A>determined by marriages: the child is moulded true to type when all goes 
<A NAME="986"></A>well; otherwise it is marred by some inner detriment, something due to 
<A NAME="987"></A>the mother personally or to an environment unfavourable to that particular 
<A NAME="988"></A>conception.
<A NAME="989"></A><BR><BR><B>15.</B> According to Plato, lots and choice play a part [in 
<A NAME="990"></A>the determination of human conditions] before the Spindle of Necessity 
<A NAME="991"></A>is turned; that once done, only the Spindle-destiny is valid; it fixes 
<A NAME="992"></A>the chosen conditions irretrievably since the elected guardian-spirit becomes 
<A NAME="993"></A>accessory to their accomplishment.
<A NAME="994"></A><BR><BR>But what is the significance of the Lots?
<A NAME="995"></A><BR>By the Lots we are to understand birth into the conditions actually 
<A NAME="996"></A>existent in the All at the particular moment of each entry into body, birth 
<A NAME="997"></A>into such and such a physical frame, from such and such parents, in this 
<A NAME="998"></A>or that place, and generally all that in our phraseology is the 
<A NAME="999"></A>External.
<A NAME="1000"></A><BR><BR>For Particulars and Universals alike it is established that to 
<A NAME="1001"></A>the first of those known as the Fates, to Clotho the Spinner, must be due 
<A NAME="1002"></A>the unity and as it were interweaving of all that exists: Lachesis presides 
<A NAME="1003"></A>over the Lots: to Atropos must necessarily belong the conduct of mundane 
<A NAME="1004"></A>events.
<A NAME="1005"></A><BR><BR>Of men, some enter into life as fragments of the All, bound to 
<A NAME="1006"></A>that which is external to themselves: they are victims of a sort of fascination, 
<A NAME="1007"></A>and are hardly, or not at all, themselves: but others mastering all this- 
<A NAME="1008"></A>straining, so to speak, by the head towards the Higher, to what is outside 
<A NAME="1009"></A>even the Soul- preserve still the nobility and the ancient privilege of 
<A NAME="1010"></A>the Soul's essential being.
<A NAME="1011"></A><BR><BR>For certainly we cannot think of the Soul as a thing whose nature 
<A NAME="1012"></A>is just a sum of impressions from outside- as if it, alone, of all that 
<A NAME="1013"></A>exists, had no native character.
<A NAME="1014"></A><BR><BR>No: much more than all else, the Soul, possessing the Idea which 
<A NAME="1015"></A>belongs to a Principle, must have as its native wealth many powers serving 
<A NAME="1016"></A>to the activities of its Kind. It is an Essential-Existent and with this 
<A NAME="1017"></A>Existence must go desire and act and the tendency towards some 
<A NAME="1018"></A>good.
<A NAME="1019"></A><BR><BR>While body and soul stand one combined thing, there is a joint 
<A NAME="1020"></A>nature, a definite entity having definite functions and employments; but 
<A NAME="1021"></A>as soon as any Soul is detached, its employments are kept apart, its very 
<A NAME="1022"></A>own: it ceases to take the body's concerns to itself: it has vision now: 
<A NAME="1023"></A>body and soul stand widely apart.
<A NAME="1024"></A><BR><BR><B>16.</B> The question arises what phase of the Soul enters into 
<A NAME="1025"></A>the union for the period of embodiment and what phase remains distinct, 
<A NAME="1026"></A>what is separable and what necessarily interlinked, and in general what 
<A NAME="1027"></A>the Living-Being is.
<A NAME="1028"></A><BR><BR>On all this there has been a conflict of teaching: the matter must 
<A NAME="1029"></A>be examined later on from quite other considerations than occupy us here. 
<A NAME="1030"></A>For the present let us explain in what sense we have described the All 
<A NAME="1031"></A>as the expressed idea of the Governing Soul.
<A NAME="1032"></A><BR><BR>One theory might be that the Soul creates the particular entities 
<A NAME="1033"></A>in succession- man followed by horse and other animals domestic or wild: 
<A NAME="1034"></A>fire and earth, though, first of all- that it watches these creations acting 
<A NAME="1035"></A>upon each other whether to help or to harm, observes, and no more, the 
<A NAME="1036"></A>tangled web formed of all these strands, and their unfailing sequences; 
<A NAME="1037"></A>and that it makes no concern of the result beyond securing the reproduction 
<A NAME="1038"></A>of the primal living-beings, leaving them for the rest to act upon each 
<A NAME="1039"></A>other according to their definite natures.
<A NAME="1040"></A><BR><BR>Another view makes the soul answerable for all that thus comes 
<A NAME="1041"></A>about, since its first creations have set up the entire 
<A NAME="1042"></A>enchainment.
<A NAME="1043"></A><BR><BR>No doubt the Reason-Principle [conveyed by the Soul] covers all 
<A NAME="1044"></A>the action and experience of this realm: nothing happens, even here, by 
<A NAME="1045"></A>any form of haphazard; all follows a necessary order.
<A NAME="1046"></A><BR><BR>Is everything, then, to be attributed to the act of the 
<A NAME="1047"></A>Reason-Principles?
<A NAME="1048"></A><BR><BR>To their existence, no doubt, but not to their effective action; 
<A NAME="1049"></A>they exist and they know; or better, the Soul, which contains the engendering 
<A NAME="1050"></A>Reason-Principle, knows the results of all it has brought to pass. For 
<A NAME="1051"></A>whensoever similar factors meet and act in relation to each other, similar 
<A NAME="1052"></A>consequences must inevitably ensue: the Soul adopting or foreplanning the 
<A NAME="1053"></A>given conditions accomplishes the due outcome and links all into a 
<A NAME="1054"></A>total.
<A NAME="1055"></A><BR><BR>All, then, is antecedent and resultant, each sequent becoming in 
<A NAME="1056"></A>turn an antecedent once it has taken its place among things. And perhaps 
<A NAME="1057"></A>this is a cause of progressive deterioration: men, for instance, are not 
<A NAME="1058"></A>as they were of old; by dint of interval and of the inevitable law, the 
<A NAME="1059"></A>Reason-Principles have ceded something to the characteristics of the 
<A NAME="1060"></A>Matter.
<A NAME="1061"></A><BR><BR>But:
<A NAME="1062"></A><BR>The Soul watches the ceaselessly changing universe and follows all 
<A NAME="1063"></A>the fate of all its works: this is its life, and it knows no respite from 
<A NAME="1064"></A>this care, but is ever labouring to bring about perfection, planning to 
<A NAME="1065"></A>lead all to an unending state of excellence- like a farmer, first sowing 
<A NAME="1066"></A>and planting and then constantly setting to rights where rainstorms and 
<A NAME="1067"></A>long frosts and high gales have played havoc.
<A NAME="1068"></A><BR><BR>If such a conception of Soul be rejected as untenable, we are obliged 
<A NAME="1069"></A>to think that the Reason-Principles themselves foreknew or even contained 
<A NAME="1070"></A>the ruin and all the consequences of flaw.
<A NAME="1071"></A><BR><BR>But then we would be imputing the creation of evil to the Reason-Principles, 
<A NAME="1072"></A>though the arts and their guiding principle do not include blundering, 
<A NAME="1073"></A>do not cover the inartistic, the destruction of the work of 
<A NAME="1074"></A>art.
<A NAME="1075"></A><BR><BR>And here it will be objected that in All there is nothing contrary 
<A NAME="1076"></A>to nature, nothing evil.
<A NAME="1077"></A><BR><BR>Still, by the side of the better there exists also what is less 
<A NAME="1078"></A>good.
<A NAME="1079"></A><BR><BR>Well, perhaps even the less good has its contributory value in 
<A NAME="1080"></A>the All. Perhaps there is no need that everything be good. Contraries may 
<A NAME="1081"></A>co-operate; and without opposites there could be no ordered Universe: all 
<A NAME="1082"></A>living beings of the partial realm include contraries. The better elements 
<A NAME="1083"></A>are compelled into existence and moulded to their function by the Reason-Principle 
<A NAME="1084"></A>directly; the less good are potentially present in the Reason-Principles, 
<A NAME="1085"></A>actually present in the phenomena themselves; the Soul's power had reached 
<A NAME="1086"></A>its limit, and failed to bring the Reason-Principles into complete actuality 
<A NAME="1087"></A>since, amid the clash of these antecedent Principles, Matter had already 
<A NAME="1088"></A>from its own stock produced the less good.
<A NAME="1089"></A><BR><BR>Yet, with all this, Matter is continuously overruled towards the 
<A NAME="1090"></A>better; so that out of the total of things- modified by Soul on the one 
<A NAME="1091"></A>hand and by Matter on the other hand, and on neither hand as sound as in 
<A NAME="1092"></A>the Reason-Principles- there is, in the end, a Unity.
<A NAME="1093"></A><BR><BR><B>17.</B> But these Reason-Principles, contained in the Soul, 
<A NAME="1094"></A>are they Thoughts?
<A NAME="1095"></A><BR><BR>And if so, by what process does the Soul create in accordance with 
<A NAME="1096"></A>these Thoughts?
<A NAME="1097"></A><BR><BR>It is upon Matter that this act of the Reason is exercised; and 
<A NAME="1098"></A>what acts physically is not an intellectual operation or a vision, but 
<A NAME="1099"></A>a power modifying matter, not conscious of it but merely acting upon it: 
<A NAME="1100"></A>the Reason-Principle, in other words, acts much like a force producing 
<A NAME="1101"></A>a figure or pattern upon water- that of a circle, suppose, where the formation 
<A NAME="1102"></A>of the ring is conditioned by something distinct from that force 
<A NAME="1103"></A>itself.
<A NAME="1104"></A><BR><BR>If this is so, the prior puissance of the Soul [that which conveys 
<A NAME="1105"></A>the Reason-Principles] must act by manipulating the other Soul, that which 
<A NAME="1106"></A>is united with Matter and has the generative function.
<A NAME="1107"></A><BR><BR>But is this handling the result of calculation?
<A NAME="1108"></A><BR>Calculation implies reference. Reference, then, to something outside 
<A NAME="1109"></A>or to something contained within itself? If to its own content, there is 
<A NAME="1110"></A>no need of reasoning, which could not itself perform the act of creation; 
<A NAME="1111"></A>creation is the operation of that phase of the Soul which contains Ideal-Principles; 
<A NAME="1112"></A>for that is its stronger puissance, its creative part.
<A NAME="1113"></A><BR><BR>It creates, then, on the model of the Ideas; for, what it has received 
<A NAME="1114"></A>from the Intellectual-Principle it must pass on in turn.
<A NAME="1115"></A><BR><BR>In sum, then, the Intellectual-Principle gives from itself to the 
<A NAME="1116"></A>Soul of the All which follows immediately upon it: this again gives forth 
<A NAME="1117"></A>from itself to its next, illuminated and imprinted by it; and that secondary 
<A NAME="1118"></A>Soul at once begins to create, as under order, unhindered in some of its 
<A NAME="1119"></A>creations, striving in others against the repugnance of 
<A NAME="1120"></A>Matter.
<A NAME="1121"></A><BR><BR>It has a creative power, derived; it is stored with Reason-Principles 
<A NAME="1122"></A>not the very originals: therefore it creates, but not in full accordance 
<A NAME="1123"></A>with the Principles from which it has been endowed: something enters from 
<A NAME="1124"></A>itself; and, plainly, this is inferior. The issue then is something living, 
<A NAME="1125"></A>yes; but imperfect, hindering its own life, something very poor and reluctant 
<A NAME="1126"></A>and crude, formed in a Matter that is the fallen sediment of the Higher 
<A NAME="1127"></A>Order, bitter and embittering. This is the Soul's contribution to the 
<A NAME="1128"></A>All.
<A NAME="1129"></A><BR><BR><B>18.</B> Are the evils in the Universe necessary because it is 
<A NAME="1130"></A>of later origin than the Higher Sphere?
<A NAME="1131"></A><BR><BR>Perhaps rather because without evil the All would be incomplete. 
<A NAME="1132"></A>For most or even all forms of evil serve the Universe- much as the poisonous 
<A NAME="1133"></A>snake has its use- though in most cases their function is unknown. Vice 
<A NAME="1134"></A>itself has many useful sides: it brings about much that is beautiful, in 
<A NAME="1135"></A>artistic creations for example, and it stirs us to thoughtful living, not 
<A NAME="1136"></A>allowing us to drowse in security.
<A NAME="1137"></A><BR><BR>If all this is so, then [the secret of creation is that] the Soul 
<A NAME="1138"></A>of the All abides in contemplation of the Highest and Best, ceaselessly 
<A NAME="1139"></A>striving towards the Intelligible Kind and towards God: but, thus absorbing 
<A NAME="1140"></A>and filled full, it overflows- so to speak- and the image it gives forth, 
<A NAME="1141"></A>its last utterance towards the lower, will be the creative 
<A NAME="1142"></A>puissance.
<A NAME="1143"></A><BR><BR>This ultimate phase, then, is the Maker, secondary to that aspect 
<A NAME="1144"></A>of the Soul which is primarily saturated from the Divine Intelligence. 
<A NAME="1145"></A>But the Creator above all is the Intellectual-Principle, as giver, to the 
<A NAME="1146"></A>Soul that follows it, of those gifts whose traces exist in the Third 
<A NAME="1147"></A>Kind.
<A NAME="1148"></A><BR><BR>Rightly, therefore, is this Kosmos described as an image continuously 
<A NAME="1149"></A>being imaged, the First and the Second Principles immobile, the Third, 
<A NAME="1150"></A>too, immobile essentially, but, accidentally and in Matter, having 
<A NAME="1151"></A>motion.
<A NAME="1152"></A><BR><BR>For as long as divine Mind and Soul exist, the divine Thought-Forms 
<A NAME="1153"></A>will pour forth into that phase of the Soul: as long as there is a sun, 
<A NAME="1154"></A>all that streams from it will be some form of Light.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="1155"></A><B>Fourth Tractate</B>

<A NAME="1156"></A><BR><BR><B>MATTER IN ITS TWO KINDS.</B>
