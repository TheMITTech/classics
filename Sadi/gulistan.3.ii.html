<A NAME="10"></A><B>The Morals of Dervishes</B>
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="11"></A>Story 1
<A NAME="12"></A><BR><BR>One of the great devotees having been asked about his opinion concerning 
<A NAME="13"></A>a hermit whom others had censured in their conversation, he replied: 'I 
<A NAME="14"></A>do not see any external blemishes on him and do not know of internal 
<A NAME="15"></A>ones.'
<A NAME="16"></A><BR><BR>Whomsoever thou seest in a religious habit
<A NAME="17"></A><BR>Consider him to be a religious and good man
<A NAME="18"></A><BR>And, if thou knowest not his internal condition,
<A NAME="19"></A><BR>What business has the muhtasib inside the house?
<A NAME="20"></A><BR><BR>Story 2
<A NAME="21"></A><BR><BR>I saw a dervish who placed his head upon the threshold of the Ka'bah, 
<A NAME="22"></A>groaned, and said: 'O forgiving, 0 merciful one, thou knowest what an unrighteous, 
<A NAME="23"></A>ignorant man can offer to thee.'
<A NAME="24"></A><BR><BR>I have craved pardon for the deficiency of my 
<A NAME="25"></A>service
<A NAME="26"></A><BR>Because I can implore no reward for my obedience.
<A NAME="27"></A><BR>Sinners repent of their transgressions.
<A NAME="28"></A><BR>Arifs ask forgiveness for their imperfect worship.
<A NAME="29"></A><BR><BR>Devotees desire a reward for their obedience and merchants the 
<A NAME="30"></A>price of their wares but I, who am a worshipper, have brought hope and 
<A NAME="31"></A>not obedience. I have come to beg and not to trade. Deal with me as thou 
<A NAME="32"></A>deemest fit.
<A NAME="33"></A><BR><BR>Whether thou killest me or forgivest my crime,
<A NAME="34"></A><BR>my face and head are on thy threshold.
<A NAME="35"></A><BR>A slave has nothing to command; whatever thou commandest I 
<A NAME="36"></A>obey.
<A NAME="37"></A><BR><BR>I saw a mendicant at the door of the Ka'bah
<A NAME="38"></A><BR>Who said this and wept abundantly:
<A NAME="39"></A><BR>'I ask not for the acceptance of my service
<A NAME="40"></A><BR>But for drawing the pen of pardon over my sins.'
<A NAME="41"></A><BR><BR>Story 3
<A NAME="42"></A><BR><BR>I saw A'bd-u-Qader Gaillani in the sanctuary of the Ka'bah with 
<A NAME="43"></A>his face on the pebbles and saying: 'O lord, pardon my sins and, if I deserve 
<A NAME="44"></A>punishment, cause me to arise blind on the day of resurrection that I may 
<A NAME="45"></A>not be ashamed in the sight of the righteous.'
<A NAME="46"></A><BR><BR>With my face on the earth of helplessness
<A NAME="47"></A><BR>I say Every morning as soon as I become conscious:
<A NAME="48"></A><BR>O thou whom I shall never forget
<A NAME="49"></A><BR>Wilt thou at all remember thy slave?
<A NAME="50"></A><BR><BR>Story 4
<A NAME="51"></A><BR><BR>A thief paid a visit to the house of a pious man but, although 
<A NAME="52"></A>he sought a great deal, found nothing and was much grieved. The pious man, 
<A NAME="53"></A>who knew this, threw the blanket upon which he had been sleeping into the 
<A NAME="54"></A>way of the thief that he might not go away disappointed.
<A NAME="55"></A><BR><BR>I heard that men of the way of God
<A NAME="56"></A><BR>Have not distressed the hearts of enemies.
<A NAME="57"></A><BR>How canst thou attain that dignity
<A NAME="58"></A><BR>Who quarrelest and wagest war against friends?
<A NAME="59"></A><BR><BR>The friendship of pure men, whether in thy presence or absence, 
<A NAME="60"></A>is not such as Will find fault behind thy back and is ready to die for 
<A NAME="61"></A>thee before thy face.
<A NAME="62"></A><BR><BR>In thy presence gentle like a lamb,
<A NAME="63"></A><BR>In thy absence like a man-devouring wolf.
<A NAME="64"></A><BR><BR>Who brings the faults of another to thee and enumerates 
<A NAME="65"></A>them
<A NAME="66"></A><BR>Will undoubtedly carry thy faults to others.
<A NAME="67"></A><BR><BR>Story 5
<A NAME="68"></A><BR><BR>Several travellers were on a journey together and equally sharing 
<A NAME="69"></A>each other's troubles and comforts. I desired to accompany them but they 
<A NAME="70"></A>would not agree. Then I said: 'It is foreign to the manners of great men 
<A NAME="71"></A>to turn away the face from the company of the poor and so deprive themselves 
<A NAME="72"></A>of the advantage they might derive therefrom because I for one consider 
<A NAME="73"></A>myself sufficiently strong and energetic to be of service to men and not 
<A NAME="74"></A>an encumbrance. Although I am not riding on a beast, I shall aid you in 
<A NAME="75"></A>carrying blankets.' One of them said: 'Do not be grieved at the words thou 
<A NAME="76"></A>hast heard because some days ago a thief in the guise of a dervish arrived 
<A NAME="77"></A>and joined our company.'
<A NAME="78"></A><BR><BR>How can people know who is in the dress?
<A NAME="79"></A><BR>The writer is aware what the book contains.
<A NAME="80"></A><BR><BR>As the state of dervishes is safe, they entertained no suspicion 
<A NAME="81"></A>about him and received him as a friend.
<A NAME="82"></A><BR><BR>The outward state of Arifs is the patched dress.
<A NAME="83"></A><BR>It suffices as a display to the face of the people.
<A NAME="84"></A><BR><BR>Strive by thy acts to be good and wear anything thou 
<A NAME="85"></A>listest.
<A NAME="86"></A><BR>Place a crown on thy head and a flag on thy back.
<A NAME="87"></A><BR>The abandoning of the world, of lust, and of desire
<A NAME="88"></A><BR>Is sanctity, not the abandonment of the robe only.
<A NAME="89"></A><BR>It is necessary to show manhood in the fight.
<A NAME="90"></A><BR>Of what profit are weapons of war to an hermaphrodite?
<A NAME="91"></A><BR><BR>We travelled one day till the night set in during which we slept 
<A NAME="92"></A>near a fort and the graceless thief, taking up the water-pot of a companion, 
<A NAME="93"></A>pretending to go for an ablution, departed for plunder.
<A NAME="94"></A><BR><BR>A pretended saint who wears the dervish garb
<A NAME="95"></A><BR>Has made of the Ka'bah's robes the covering of an 
<A NAME="96"></A>ass.
<A NAME="97"></A><BR><BR>After disappearing from the sight of the dervishes, he went to 
<A NAME="98"></A>a tower from which he stole a casket and, when the day dawned, the dark-hearted 
<A NAME="99"></A>wretch had already progressed a considerable distance. In the morning the 
<A NAME="100"></A>guiltless sleeping companions were all taken to the fort and thrown into 
<A NAME="101"></A>prison. From that date we renounced companionship and took the road of 
<A NAME="102"></A>solitude, according to the maxim: Safety is in solitude.
<A NAME="103"></A><BR><BR>When one of a tribe has done a foolish thing
<A NAME="104"></A><BR>No honour is left either to the low or the high.
<A NAME="105"></A><BR>Seest thou not how one ox of the pasturage
<A NAME="106"></A><BR>Defiles all oxen of the village?
<A NAME="107"></A><BR><BR>I replied: 'Thanks be to the God of majesty and glory, I have not 
<A NAME="108"></A>been excluded from the advantages enjoyed by dervishes, although I have 
<A NAME="109"></A>separated myself from their society. I have profited by what thou hast 
<A NAME="110"></A>narrated to me and this admonition will be of use through life to persons 
<A NAME="111"></A>like me.'
<A NAME="112"></A><BR><BR>For one rude fellow in the assembly
<A NAME="113"></A><BR>The heart of intelligent men is much grieved.
<A NAME="114"></A><BR>If a tank be filled with rose-water
<A NAME="115"></A><BR>A dog falling into it pollutes the whole.
<A NAME="116"></A><BR><BR>Story 6
<A NAME="117"></A><BR><BR>A hermit, being the guest of a padshah, ate less than he wished 
<A NAME="118"></A>when sitting at dinner and when he rose for prayers he prolonged them more 
<A NAME="119"></A>than was his wont in order to enhance the opinion entertained by the padshah 
<A NAME="120"></A>of his piety.
<A NAME="121"></A><BR><BR>O Arab of the desert, I fear thou wilt not reach the 
<A NAME="122"></A>Ka'bah
<A NAME="123"></A><BR>Because the road on which thou travellest leads to 
<A NAME="124"></A>Turkestan.
<A NAME="125"></A><BR><BR>When he returned to his own house, he desired the table to be laid 
<A NAME="126"></A>out for eating. He had an intelligent son who said: 'Father, hast thou 
<A NAME="127"></A>not eaten anything at the repast of the sultan?' He replied: 'I have not 
<A NAME="128"></A>eaten anything to serve a purpose.' The boy said: 'Then likewise say thy 
<A NAME="129"></A>prayers again as thou hast not done anything to serve that 
<A NAME="130"></A>purpose.'
<A NAME="131"></A><BR><BR>O thou who showest virtues on the palms of the 
<A NAME="132"></A>hand
<A NAME="133"></A><BR>But concealest thy errors under the armpit
<A NAME="134"></A><BR>What wilt thou purchase, O vain-glorious fool,
<A NAME="135"></A><BR>On the day of distress with counterfeit silver?
<A NAME="136"></A><BR><BR>Story 7
<A NAME="137"></A><BR><BR>I remember, being in my childhood pious, rising in the night, addicted 
<A NAME="138"></A>to devotion and abstinence. One night I was sitting with my father, remaining 
<A NAME="139"></A>awake and holding the beloved Quran in my lap, whilst the people around 
<A NAME="140"></A>us were asleep. I said: 'Not one of these persons lifts up his head or 
<A NAME="141"></A>makes a genuflection. They are as fast asleep as if they were dead.' He 
<A NAME="142"></A>replied: 'Darling of thy father, would that thou wert also asleep rather 
<A NAME="143"></A>than disparaging people.'
<A NAME="144"></A><BR><BR>The pretender sees no one but himself
<A NAME="145"></A><BR>Because he has the veil of conceit in front.
<A NAME="146"></A><BR>If he were endowed with a God-discerning eye
<A NAME="147"></A><BR>He would see that no one is weaker than himself.
<A NAME="148"></A><BR><BR>Story 8
<A NAME="149"></A><BR><BR>A great man was praised in an assembly and, his good qualities 
<A NAME="150"></A>being extolled, he raised his head and said: 'I am such as I know myself 
<A NAME="151"></A>to be.'
<A NAME="152"></A><BR><BR>O thou who reckonest my virtues, refrainest from giving me 
<A NAME="153"></A>pain,
<A NAME="154"></A><BR>These are my open, and thou knowest not my hidden, 
<A NAME="155"></A>qualities.
<A NAME="156"></A><BR><BR>My person is, to the eyes of the world, of good 
<A NAME="157"></A>aspect
<A NAME="158"></A><BR>But my internal wickedness makes me droop my head with 
<A NAME="159"></A>shame.
<A NAME="160"></A><BR>The peacock is for his beauteous colours by the 
<A NAME="161"></A>people
<A NAME="162"></A><BR>Praised whilst he is ashamed of his ugly feet.
<A NAME="163"></A><BR><BR>Story 9
<A NAME="164"></A><BR><BR>One of the devotees of Mount Lebanon, whose piety was famed in 
<A NAME="165"></A>the Arab country and his miracles well known, entered the cathedral mosque 
<A NAME="166"></A>of Damascus and was performing his purificatory ablution on the edge of 
<A NAME="167"></A>a tank when his feet slipped and he fell into the reservoir but saved himself 
<A NAME="168"></A>with great trouble. After the congregation had finished their prayers, 
<A NAME="169"></A>one of his companions said: 'I have a difficulty.' He asked: 'What is it?' 
<A NAME="170"></A>He continued: 'I remember that the sheikh walked on the surface of the 
<A NAME="171"></A>African sea without his feet getting wetted and today he nearly perished 
<A NAME="172"></A>in this paltry water which is not deeper than a man's stature. What reason 
<A NAME="173"></A>is there in this?' The sheikh drooped his head into the bosom of meditation 
<A NAME="174"></A>and said after a long pause: 'Hast thou not heard that the prince of the 
<A NAME="175"></A>world, Muhammad the chosen, upon whom be the benediction of Allah and peace, 
<A NAME="176"></A>has said: I have time with Allah during which no cherubim nor inspired 
<A NAME="177"></A>prophet is equal to me?' But he did not say that such was always the case. 
<A NAME="178"></A>The time alluded to was when Gabriel or Michael inspired him whilst on 
<A NAME="179"></A>other occasions he was satisfied with the society of Hafsah and Zainab. 
<A NAME="180"></A>The visions of the righteous one are between brilliancy and 
<A NAME="181"></A>obscurity.
<A NAME="182"></A><BR><BR>Thou showest thy countenance and then hidest 
<A NAME="183"></A>it
<A NAME="184"></A><BR>Enhancing thy value and augmenting our desire.
<A NAME="185"></A><BR><BR>I behold whom I love without an intervention.
<A NAME="186"></A><BR>Then a trance befalls me; I lose the road;
<A NAME="187"></A><BR>It kindles fire, then quenches it with a sprinkling 
<A NAME="188"></A>shower.
<A NAME="189"></A><BR>Wherefore thou seest me burning and drowning.
<A NAME="190"></A><BR><BR>Story 10
<A NAME="191"></A><BR><BR>One asked the man who had lost his son:
<A NAME="192"></A><BR><BR>'O noble and intelligent old man!
<A NAME="193"></A><BR>As thou hast smelt the odour of his garment from 
<A NAME="194"></A>Egypt
<A NAME="195"></A><BR>Why hast thou not seen him in the well of Canaan?'
<A NAME="196"></A><BR><BR>He replied:
<A NAME="197"></A><BR><BR>'My state is that of leaping lightning.
<A NAME="198"></A><BR>One moment it appears and at another vanishes.
<A NAME="199"></A><BR>I am sometimes sitting in high heaven.
<A NAME="200"></A><BR>Sometimes I cannot see the back of my foot.
<A NAME="201"></A><BR>Were a dervish always to remain in that state
<A NAME="202"></A><BR>He would not care for the two worlds.'
<A NAME="203"></A><BR><BR>Story 11
<A NAME="204"></A><BR><BR>I spoke in the cathedral mosque of Damascus a few words by way 
<A NAME="205"></A>of a sermon but to a congregation whose hearts were withered and dead, 
<A NAME="206"></A>not having travelled from the road of the world of form, the physical, 
<A NAME="207"></A>to the world of meaning, the moral world. I perceived that my words took 
<A NAME="208"></A>no effect and that burning fire does not kindle moist wood. I was sorry 
<A NAME="209"></A>for instructing brutes and holding forth a mirror in a locality of blind 
<A NAME="210"></A>people. I had, however, opened the door of meaning and was giving a long 
<A NAME="211"></A>explanation of the verse We are nearer unto Him than the jugular vein till 
<A NAME="212"></A>I said:
<A NAME="213"></A><BR><BR>'The Friend is nearer to me than my self,
<A NAME="214"></A><BR>But it is more strange that I am far from him.
<A NAME="215"></A><BR>What am I to do? To whom can it be said that he
<A NAME="216"></A><BR>Is in my arms, but I am exiled from him.'
<A NAME="217"></A><BR><BR>I had intoxicated myself with the wine of these sentiments, holding 
<A NAME="218"></A>the remnant of the cup of the sermon in my hand when a traveller happened 
<A NAME="219"></A>to pass near the edge of the assembly, and the last turn of the circulating 
<A NAME="220"></A>cup made such an impression upon him that he shouted and the others joined 
<A NAME="221"></A>him who began to roar, whilst the raw portion of the congregation became 
<A NAME="222"></A>turbulent. Whereon I said: 'Praise be to Allah! Those who are far away 
<A NAME="223"></A>but intelligent are in the presence of Allah, and those who are near but 
<A NAME="224"></A>blind are distant.'
<A NAME="225"></A><BR><BR>When the hearer understands not the meaning of 
<A NAME="226"></A>words
<A NAME="227"></A><BR>Do not look for the effect of the orator's force
<A NAME="228"></A><BR>But raise an extensive field of desire
<A NAME="229"></A><BR>That the eloquent man may strike the ball of effect.
<A NAME="230"></A><BR><BR>Story 12
<A NAME="231"></A><BR><BR>One night I had in the desert of Mekkah become so weak from want 
<A NAME="232"></A>of sleep that I was unable to walk and, laying myself down, told the camel 
<A NAME="233"></A>driver to let me alone.
<A NAME="234"></A><BR><BR>How far can the foot of a wretched pedestrian 
<A NAME="235"></A>go
<A NAME="236"></A><BR>When a dromedary gets distressed by its load?
<A NAME="237"></A><BR>Whilst the body of a fat man becomes lean
<A NAME="238"></A><BR>A weak man will be dead of exhaustion.
<A NAME="239"></A><BR><BR>He replied: 'O brother, the sanctuary is in front of us and brigands 
<A NAME="240"></A>in the rear. If thou goest thou wilt prosper. If thou sleepest thou wilt 
<A NAME="241"></A>die.'
<A NAME="242"></A><BR><BR>It is pleasant to sleep under an acacia on the desert 
<A NAME="243"></A>road
<A NAME="244"></A><BR>But alas! thou must bid farewell to life on the night of 
<A NAME="245"></A>departure.
<A NAME="246"></A><BR><BR>Story 13
<A NAME="247"></A><BR><BR>I saw a holy man on the seashore who had been wounded by a tiger. 
<A NAME="248"></A>No medicine could relieve his pain; he suffered much but he nevertheless 
<A NAME="249"></A>constantly thanked God the most high, saying: 'Praise be to Allah that 
<A NAME="250"></A>I have fallen into a calamity and not into sin.'
<A NAME="251"></A><BR><BR>If that beloved Friend decrees me to be slain
<A NAME="252"></A><BR>I shall not say that moment that I grieve for life
<A NAME="253"></A><BR>Or say: What fault has thy slave committed?
<A NAME="254"></A><BR>My grief will be for having offended thee.
<A NAME="255"></A><BR><BR>Story 14
<A NAME="256"></A><BR><BR>A dervish who had fallen into want stole a blanket from the house 
<A NAME="257"></A>of a friend. The judge ordered his hand to be amputated but the owner of 
<A NAME="258"></A>the blanket interceded, saying that he had condoned the fault. The judge 
<A NAME="259"></A>rejoined: 'Thy intercession cannot persuade me to neglect the provision 
<A NAME="260"></A>of the law.' The man continued: 'Thou hast spoken the truth but amputation 
<A NAME="261"></A>is not applicable to a person who steals some property dedicated to pious 
<A NAME="262"></A>uses. More over a beggar possesses nothing and whatever belongs to a dervish 
<A NAME="263"></A>is dedicated to the use of the needy.' Thereon the judge released the culprit, 
<A NAME="264"></A>saying: 'The world must indeed have become too narrow for thee that thou 
<A NAME="265"></A>hast committed no theft except from the house of such a friend.' He replied: 
<A NAME="266"></A>'Hast thou not heard the saying: Sweep out the house of friends and do 
<A NAME="267"></A>not knock at the door of foes.'
<A NAME="268"></A><BR><BR>If thou sinkest in a calamity be not helpless.
<A NAME="269"></A><BR>Strip thy foes of their skins and thy friends of their

<A NAME="272"></A><BR><BR>A padshah, meeting a holy man, asked him whether he did not sometimes 
<A NAME="273"></A>remember him for the purpose of getting presents. He replied: 'Yes, I do, 
<A NAME="274"></A>whenever I forget God.'
<A NAME="275"></A><BR><BR>Whom He drives from his door, runs everywhere.
<A NAME="276"></A><BR>Whom He calls, runs to no one's door.
<A NAME="277"></A><BR><BR>Story 16
<A NAME="278"></A><BR><BR>A pious man saw in a dream a padshah in paradise and a devotee 
<A NAME="279"></A>in hell whereon he asked for the reason of the former's exaltation and 
<A NAME="280"></A>the latter's degradation, saying that he had imagined the contrary ought 
<A NAME="281"></A>to be the case. He received the following answer: 'The padshah had, for 
<A NAME="282"></A>the love he bore to dervishes, been rewarded with paradise and the devotee 
<A NAME="283"></A>had, for associating with padshahs, been punished in 
<A NAME="284"></A>hell.'
<A NAME="285"></A><BR><BR>Of what use is thy frock, rosary and patched 
<A NAME="286"></A>dress?
<A NAME="287"></A><BR>Keep thyself free from despicable practices.
<A NAME="288"></A><BR>Then thou wilt have no need of a cap of leaves.
<A NAME="289"></A><BR>Have the qualities of a dervish and wear a Tatar 
<A NAME="290"></A>cap.
<A NAME="291"></A><BR><BR>Story 17
<A NAME="292"></A><BR><BR>A bareheaded and barefooted pedestrian who had arrived from Kufah 
<A NAME="293"></A>with the Hejaz-caravan of pilgrims joined us, strutted about and 
<A NAME="294"></A>recited:
<A NAME="295"></A><BR><BR>'I am neither riding a camel nor under a load like a 
<A NAME="296"></A>camel.
<A NAME="297"></A><BR>I am neither a lord of subjects nor the slave of a 
<A NAME="298"></A>potentate.
<A NAME="299"></A><BR>Grief for the present, or distress for the past, does 
<A NAME="300"></A>not
<A NAME="301"></A><BR>trouble me.
<A NAME="302"></A><BR>I draw my breath in comfort and thus spend my life.'
<A NAME="303"></A><BR><BR>A camel-rider shouted to him: 'O dervish, where art thou going? 
<A NAME="304"></A>Return, for thou wilt expire from hardships.' He paid no attention but 
<A NAME="305"></A>entered the desert and marched. When we reached the station at the palm-grove 
<A NAME="306"></A>of Mahmud, the rich man was on the point of death and the dervish, approaching 
<A NAME="307"></A>his pillow, said: 'We have not expired from hardship but thou hast died 
<A NAME="308"></A>on a dromedary.'
<A NAME="309"></A><BR><BR>A man wept all night near the head of a patient.
<A NAME="310"></A><BR>When the day dawned he died and the patient revived.
<A NAME="311"></A><BR><BR>Many a fleet charger had fallen dead
<A NAME="312"></A><BR>While a lame ass reached the station alive.
<A NAME="313"></A><BR>Often healthy persons were in the soil
<A NAME="314"></A><BR>Buried and the wounded did not die.

<A NAME="316"></A><BR><BR>A hermit, having been invited by a padshah, concluded that if he 
<A NAME="317"></A>were to take some medicine to make himself weak he might perhaps enhance 
<A NAME="318"></A>the opinion of the padshah regarding his merits. But it is related that 
<A NAME="319"></A>the medicine was lethal so that when he partook of it he 
<A NAME="320"></A>died.
<A NAME="321"></A><BR><BR>Who appeared to thee all marrow like a pistachio
<A NAME="322"></A><BR>Was but skin upon skin like an onion.

<A NAME="328"></A><BR><BR>A caravan having been plundered in the Yunan country and deprived 
<A NAME="329"></A>of boundless wealth, the merchants wept and lamented, beseeching God and 
<A NAME="330"></A>the prophet to intercede for them with the robbers, but 
<A NAME="331"></A>ineffectually.
<A NAME="332"></A><BR><BR>When a dark-minded robber is victorious
<A NAME="333"></A><BR>What cares he for the weeping of the caravan?
<A NAME="334"></A><BR><BR>Loqman the philosopher being among the people of the caravan, one 
<A NAME="335"></A>of them asked him to speak a few words of wisdom and advice to the robbers 
<A NAME="336"></A>so that they might perhaps return some of the property they had plundered 
<A NAME="337"></A>because the loss of so much wealth would be lamentable. Loqman replied: 
<A NAME="338"></A>'It would be lamentable to utter one word of wisdom to 
<A NAME="339"></A>them.'
<A NAME="340"></A><BR><BR>The rust which has eaten into iron
<A NAME="341"></A><BR>Cannot be removed by polishing.

<A NAME="343"></A><BR>An iron nail cannot be driven into a rock.
<A NAME="344"></A><BR><BR>Help the distressed in the day of prosperity
<A NAME="345"></A><BR>Because comforting the poor averts evil from thyself.

<A NAME="348"></A><BR><BR>Story 20
<A NAME="349"></A><BR><BR>Despite the abundant admonitions of the most illustrious Sheikh 
<A NAME="350"></A>Abulfaraj Ben Juzi to shun musical entertainments and to prefer solitude 
<A NAME="351"></A>and retirement, the budding of my youth overcame me, my sensual desires 
<A NAME="352"></A>were excited so that, unable to resist them, I walked some steps contrary 
<A NAME="353"></A>to the opinion of my tutor, enjoying myself in musical amusements and convivial 
<A NAME="354"></A>meetings. When the advice of my sheikh occurred to my mind, I 
<A NAME="355"></A>said:
<A NAME="356"></A><BR><BR>'If the qazi were sitting with us, he would clap his 
<A NAME="357"></A>hands.
<A NAME="358"></A><BR>If the muhtasib were bibbing wine, he would excuse a 
<A NAME="359"></A>drunkard.'
<A NAME="360"></A><BR><BR>Thus I lived till I paid one night a visit to an assembly of people 
<A NAME="361"></A>in which I saw a musician.
<A NAME="362"></A><BR><BR>Thou wouldst have said he is tearing up the vital 
<A NAME="363"></A>artery
<A NAME="364"></A><BR>with his fiddle-bow.
<A NAME="365"></A><BR>His voice was more unpleasant than the wailing of one 
<A NAME="366"></A>who
<A NAME="367"></A><BR>lost his father.
<A NAME="368"></A><BR><BR>The audience now stopped their ears with their fingers, and now 
<A NAME="369"></A>put them on their lips to silence him. We became ecstatic by the sounds 
<A NAME="370"></A>of pleasing songs but thou art such a singer that when thou art silent 
<A NAME="371"></A>we are pleased.
<A NAME="372"></A><BR><BR>No one feels pleased by thy performance
<A NAME="373"></A><BR>Except at the time of departure when thou pleasest.
<A NAME="374"></A><BR><BR>When that harper began to sing
<A NAME="375"></A><BR>I said to the host: 'For God's sake
<A NAME="376"></A><BR>Put mercury in my ear that I may not hear
<A NAME="377"></A><BR>Or open the door that I may go away.'
<A NAME="378"></A><BR><BR>In short, I tried to please my friends and succeeded after a considerable 
<A NAME="379"></A>struggle in spending the whole night there.
<A NAME="380"></A><BR><BR>The muezzin shouted the call to prayers out of 
<A NAME="381"></A>time,
<A NAME="382"></A><BR>Not knowing how much of the night had elapsed.
<A NAME="383"></A><BR>Ask the length of the night from my eyelids
<A NAME="384"></A><BR>For sleep did not enter my eyes one moment.
<A NAME="385"></A><BR><BR>In the morning I took my turban from my head, with one dinar from 
<A NAME="386"></A>my belt by way of gratification, and placed them before the musician whom 
<A NAME="387"></A>I embraced and thanked. My friends who saw that my appreciation of his 
<A NAME="388"></A>merits was unusual attributed it to the levity of my intellect and laughed 
<A NAME="389"></A>secretly. One of them, however, lengthened out his tongue of objection 
<A NAME="390"></A>and began to reproach me, saying that I had committed an act repugnant 
<A NAME="391"></A>to intelligent men by bestowing a portion of my professional dress upon 
<A NAME="392"></A>a musician who had all his life not a dirhem laid upon the palm of his 
<A NAME="393"></A>hand nor filings of silver or of gold placed on his 
<A NAME="394"></A>drum.
<A NAME="395"></A><BR><BR>A musician! Far be he from this happy abode.
<A NAME="396"></A><BR>No one ever saw him twice in the same place.
<A NAME="397"></A><BR>As soon as the shout rose from his mouth
<A NAME="398"></A><BR>The hair on the bodies of the people stood on end.
<A NAME="399"></A><BR>The fowls of the house, terrified by him, flew away
<A NAME="400"></A><BR>Whilst he distracted our senses and tore his throat.
<A NAME="401"></A><BR><BR>I said: 'It will be proper to shorten the tongue of objection because 
<A NAME="402"></A>his talent has become evident to me.' He then asked me to explain the quality 
<A NAME="403"></A>of it in order to inform the company so that all might apologize for the 
<A NAME="404"></A>jokes they had cracked about me. I replied: 'Although my sheikh had often 
<A NAME="405"></A>told me to abandon musical entertainments and had given me abundant advice, 
<A NAME="406"></A>I did not mind it. This night my propitious horoscope and my august luck 
<A NAME="407"></A>have guided me to this place where I have, on hearing the performance of 
<A NAME="408"></A>this musician, repented and vowed never again to attend at singing and 
<A NAME="409"></A>convivial parties.'
<A NAME="410"></A><BR><BR>A pleasant voice, from a sweet palate, mouth and 
<A NAME="411"></A>lips,
<A NAME="412"></A><BR>Whether employed in singing or not, enchants the 
<A NAME="413"></A>heart
<A NAME="414"></A><BR>But the melodies of lovers of Isfahan or of the 
<A NAME="415"></A>Hejaz
<A NAME="416"></A><BR>From the windpipe of a bad singer are not nice.
<A NAME="417"></A><BR><BR>Story 21
<A NAME="418"></A><BR><BR>Loqman, being asked from whom he had learnt civility, replied: 
<A NAME="419"></A>'From those who had no civility because what appeared to me unbecoming 
<A NAME="420"></A>in them I refrained from doing.'
<A NAME="421"></A><BR><BR>Not a word is said even in sport
<A NAME="422"></A><BR>Without an intelligent man taking advice thereby.
<A NAME="423"></A><BR>But if a hundred chapters of wisdom are read to a 
<A NAME="424"></A>fool
<A NAME="425"></A><BR>All strike his ear merely as sport.
<A NAME="426"></A><BR><BR>Story 22
<A NAME="427"></A><BR><BR>It is related that a hermit consumed during one night ten mann 
<A NAME="428"></A>of food and perused the whole Quran till morning. A pious fellow who had 
<A NAME="429"></A>heard of this said: 'It would have been more excellent if he had eaten 
<A NAME="430"></A>half a loaf and slept till the morning.'
<A NAME="431"></A><BR><BR>Keep thy interior empty of food
<A NAME="432"></A><BR>That thou mayest behold therein the light of marifet.
<A NAME="433"></A><BR>Thou art empty of wisdom for the reason
<A NAME="434"></A><BR>That thou art replete with food up to the nose.
<A NAME="435"></A><BR><BR>Story 23
<A NAME="436"></A><BR><BR>A man had by his sins forfeited the divine favour but the lamp 
<A NAME="437"></A>of grace nevertheless so shone upon his path that it guided him into the 
<A NAME="438"></A>circle of religious men and, by the blessing of his association with dervishes, 
<A NAME="439"></A>as well as by the example of their righteousness, the depravities of his 
<A NAME="440"></A>character were transmuted into virtues and he refrained from lust and passion. 
<A NAME="441"></A>But the tongues of the malevolent were lengthened with reference to his 
<A NAME="442"></A>character, alleging that it was the same as it had ever been and that his 
<A NAME="443"></A>abstinence and piety were spurious.
<A NAME="444"></A><BR><BR>By apology and penitence one may be saved from the wrath of 
<A NAME="445"></A>God
<A NAME="446"></A><BR>But cannot be saved from the tongues of men.
<A NAME="447"></A><BR><BR>He could no longer bear the reviling tongues and complained to 
<A NAME="448"></A>the pir of the Tariqat. The sheikh wept and said: 'How wilt thou be able 
<A NAME="449"></A>to be sufficiently grateful for this divine favour that thou art better 
<A NAME="450"></A>than the people imagine?'
<A NAME="451"></A><BR><BR>How long wilt thou say: 'The malevolent and 
<A NAME="452"></A>envious
<A NAME="453"></A><BR>Are searching out the defects of my humble self.
<A NAME="454"></A><BR>Sometimes they arise to shed my blood.
<A NAME="455"></A><BR>Sometimes they sit down to curse me.'
<A NAME="456"></A><BR>To be good and to be in spoken of by the people
<A NAME="457"></A><BR>Is better than to be bad and considered good by 
<A NAME="458"></A>them.
<A NAME="459"></A><BR><BR>Look at me whom the good opinion of our contemporaries deems to 
<A NAME="460"></A>be perfect whereas I am imperfection itself.
<A NAME="461"></A><BR><BR>If I were doing what I speak
<A NAME="462"></A><BR>I would be of good conduct and a devotee.
<A NAME="463"></A><BR><BR>Verily I am veiled from the eyes of my neighbours
<A NAME="464"></A><BR>But Allah knows my secret and my overt concerns.
<A NAME="465"></A><BR><BR>The door is locked to the access of people
<A NAME="466"></A><BR>That they may not spread out my faults.
<A NAME="467"></A><BR>What profiteth a closed door? The Omniscient
<A NAME="468"></A><BR>Knows what I conceal or reveal.
<A NAME="469"></A><BR><BR>Story 24
<A NAME="470"></A><BR><BR>I complained to one of the sheikhs that a certain man had falsely 
<A NAME="471"></A>accused me of lasciviousness. He replied: 'Put him to shame by thy good

<A NAME="473"></A><BR><BR>Be thou well behaved that a maligner
<A NAME="474"></A><BR>May not find occasion to speak of thy faults.

<A NAME="478"></A><BR><BR>One of the sheikhs of Syria, being asked on the true state of the 
<A NAME="479"></A>Sufis, replied: 'In former times they were a tribe in the world, apparently 
<A NAME="480"></A>distressed, but in reality contented whereas today they are people outwardly

<A NAME="487"></A><BR><BR>Story 26
<A NAME="488"></A><BR><BR>I remember having once walked all night with a caravan and then 
<A NAME="489"></A>slept on the edge of the desert. A distracted man who had accompanied us 
<A NAME="490"></A>on that journey raised a shout, ran towards the desert and took not a moment's 
<A NAME="491"></A>rest. When it was daylight, I asked him what state of his that was. He 
<A NAME="492"></A>replied: 'I saw bulbuls commencing to lament on the trees, the partridges 
<A NAME="493"></A>on the mountains, the frogs in the water and the beasts in the desert so 
<A NAME="494"></A>I bethought myself that it would not be becoming for me to sleep in carelessness 
<A NAME="495"></A>while they all were praising God.'
<A NAME="496"></A><BR><BR>Yesterday at dawn a bird lamented,
<A NAME="497"></A><BR>Depriving me of sense, patience, strength and consciousness.
<A NAME="498"></A><BR>One of my intimate friends who
<A NAME="499"></A><BR>Had perhaps heard my distressed voice
<A NAME="500"></A><BR>Said: 'I could not believe that thou
<A NAME="501"></A><BR>Wouldst be so dazed by a bird's cry.'
<A NAME="502"></A><BR>I replied: 'It is not becoming to humanity
<A NAME="503"></A><BR>That I should be silent when birds chant praises.'
<A NAME="504"></A><BR><BR>Story 27
<A NAME="505"></A><BR><BR>It once happened that on a journey to the Hejaz a company of young 
<A NAME="506"></A>and pious men, whose sentiments harmonized with mine, were my fellow-travellers. 
<A NAME="507"></A>They occasionally sung and recited spiritual verses but we had with us 
<A NAME="508"></A>also an a'bid, who entertained a bad opinion of the behaviour of the dervishes 
<A NAME="509"></A>and was ignorant of their sufferings. When we reached the palm-grove of 
<A NAME="510"></A>the Beni Hallal, a black boy of the encampment, falling into a state of 
<A NAME="511"></A>excitement, broke out in a strain which brought down the birds from the 
<A NAME="512"></A>sky. I saw, however, the camel of the a'bid, which began to prance, throwing 
<A NAME="513"></A>him and running into the desert.
<A NAME="514"></A><BR><BR>Knowest thou what that matutinal bulbul said to 
<A NAME="515"></A>me?
<A NAME="516"></A><BR>What man art thou to be ignorant of love?
<A NAME="517"></A><BR>The Arabic verses threw a camel into ecstasy and 
<A NAME="518"></A>joy.
<A NAME="519"></A><BR>If thou hast no taste thou art an ill-natured brute.
<A NAME="520"></A><BR><BR>When a camel's head is turned by the frenzy of 
<A NAME="521"></A>joy
<A NAME="522"></A><BR>And a man does not feel it, he must be an ass.
<A NAME="523"></A><BR><BR>When the winds blow over the plain
<A NAME="524"></A><BR>The branches of the ban-tree bend, not hard rocks.
<A NAME="525"></A><BR><BR>Whatever thou beholdest chants his praises.

<A NAME="527"></A><BR>Not only the bulbul on the rosebush sings praises
<A NAME="528"></A><BR>But every bramble is a tongue, extolling him.
<A NAME="529"></A><BR><BR>Story 28
<A NAME="530"></A><BR><BR>The life of a king was drawing to a close and he had no successor. 
<A NAME="531"></A>He ordered in his last testament that the next morning after his death 
<A NAME="532"></A>the first person entering the gate of the city be presented with the royal 
<A NAME="533"></A>crown and be entrusted with the government of the realm. It so happened 
<A NAME="534"></A>that the first person who entered was a mendicant who had all his life 
<A NAME="535"></A>subsisted on the morsels he collected and had sewn patch after patch upon 
<A NAME="536"></A>his clothes. The pillars of the state and grandees of the court executed 
<A NAME="537"></A>the injunction of the king and bestowed upon him the government and the 
<A NAME="538"></A>treasures; whereon the dervish reigned for a while until some amirs of 
<A NAME="539"></A>the monarchy withdrew their necks from his obedience and kings from every 
<A NAME="540"></A>side began to rise for hostilities and to prepare their armies for war. 
<A NAME="541"></A>At last his own troops and subjects also rebelled and deprived him of a 
<A NAME="542"></A>portion of his dominions. This event afflicted the mind of the dervish 
<A NAME="543"></A>until one of his old friends, who had been his companion when he was yet 
<A NAME="544"></A>himself a dervish, returned from a journey and, seeing him in such an exalted 
<A NAME="545"></A>position, said: 'Thanks be to God the most high and glorious that thy rose 
<A NAME="546"></A>has thus come forth from the thorn and thy thorn was extracted from thy 
<A NAME="547"></A>foot. Thy high luck has aided thee and prosperity with fortune has guided 
<A NAME="548"></A>thee till thou hast attained this position. Verily hardship is followed 
<A NAME="549"></A>by comfort.'
<A NAME="550"></A><BR><BR>A flower is sometimes blooming and sometimes 
<A NAME="551"></A>withering.
<A NAME="552"></A><BR>A tree is at times nude and at times clothed.
<A NAME="553"></A><BR><BR>He replied: 'Brother, condole with me because there is no occasion 
<A NAME="554"></A>for congratulation. When thou sawest me last, I was distressed for bread 
<A NAME="555"></A>and now a world of distress has overwhelmed me.'
<A NAME="556"></A><BR><BR>If I have no wealth I grieve.
<A NAME="557"></A><BR>If I have some the love of it captivates me.
<A NAME="558"></A><BR>There is no greater calamity than worldly goods.
<A NAME="559"></A><BR>Both their possession and their want are griefs.
<A NAME="560"></A><BR><BR>If thou wishest for power, covet nothing
<A NAME="561"></A><BR>Except contentment which is sufficient happiness.
<A NAME="562"></A><BR>If a rich man pours gold into thy lap
<A NAME="563"></A><BR>Care not a moment for thanking him.
<A NAME="564"></A><BR>Because often I heard great men say
<A NAME="565"></A><BR>The patience of a dervish is better than the gift of a rich 
<A NAME="566"></A>man.
<A NAME="567"></A><BR><BR>Story 29
<A NAME="568"></A><BR><BR>A man had a friend, who held the office of devan to the padshah, 
<A NAME="569"></A>but whom he had not seen for a long time; and, a man having asked him for 
<A NAME="570"></A>the reason, he replied: 'I do not want to see him.' A dependent however 
<A NAME="571"></A>of the devan, who also happened to be present, queried: 'What fault has 
<A NAME="572"></A>he committed that thou art unwilling to meet him?' He replied: 'There is 
<A NAME="573"></A>no fault in the matter but a friend who is a devan may be seen when he

<A NAME="593"></A>not having the power to retain it, unwittingly allowed it to escape. He 
<A NAME="594"></A>said: 'Friends, I had no option in what I did, the fault of it is not to 
<A NAME="595"></A>be ascribed to me and peace has resulted to my internal parts. Kindly excuse 
<A NAME="596"></A>me.'
<A NAME="597"></A><BR><BR>The belly is a prison of wind, O wise man.
<A NAME="598"></A><BR>No sage retains wind in captivity.
<A NAME="599"></A><BR>If wind twists thy belly let it out
<A NAME="600"></A><BR>Because wind in the belly is a burden to the heart.
<A NAME="601"></A><BR><BR>Story 32
<A NAME="602"></A><BR><BR>Having become tired of my friends in Damascus, I went into the 
<A NAME="603"></A>desert of Jerusalem and associated with animals till the time when I became 
<A NAME="604"></A>a prisoner of the Franks, who put me to work with infidels in digging the 
<A NAME="605"></A>earth of a moat in Tarapolis, when one of the chiefs of Aleppo, with whom 
<A NAME="606"></A>I had formerly been acquainted, recognized me and said: 'What state is 
<A NAME="607"></A>this?' I recited:
<A NAME="608"></A><BR><BR>'I fled from men to mountain and desert
<A NAME="609"></A><BR>Wishing to attend upon no one but God.
<A NAME="610"></A><BR>Imagine what my state at present is
<A NAME="611"></A><BR>When I must be satisfied in a stable of wretches.
<A NAME="612"></A><BR><BR>The feet in chains with friends
<A NAME="613"></A><BR>Is better than to be with strangers in a garden.'
<A NAME="614"></A><BR><BR>He took pity on my state and ransomed me for ten dinars from the 
<A NAME="615"></A>captivity of the Franks, taking me to Aleppo where he had a daughter and 
<A NAME="616"></A>married me to her with a dowry of one hundred dinars. After some time had 
<A NAME="617"></A>elapsed, she turned out to be ill-humoured, quarrelsome, disobedient, abusive 
<A NAME="618"></A>in her tongue and embittering my life:
<A NAME="619"></A><BR><BR>A bad wife in a good man's house
<A NAME="620"></A><BR>Is his hell in this world already.
<A NAME="621"></A><BR>Alas for a bad consort, alas!
<A NAME="622"></A><BR>Preserve us, O Lord from the punishment of fire.
<A NAME="623"></A><BR><BR>Once she lengthened her tongue of reproach and said: 'Art thou 
<A NAME="624"></A>not the man whom my father purchased from the Franks for ten dinars?' I 
<A NAME="625"></A>replied: 'Yes, he bought me for ten dinars and sold me into thy hands for 
<A NAME="626"></A>one hundred dinars.'
<A NAME="627"></A><BR><BR>I heard that a sheep had by a great man
<A NAME="628"></A><BR>Been rescued from the jaws and the power of a wolf.
<A NAME="629"></A><BR>In the evening he stroked her throat with a knife
<A NAME="630"></A><BR>Whereon the soul of the sheep complained thus:
<A NAME="631"></A><BR>Thou hast snatched me away from the claws of a wolf,
<A NAME="632"></A><BR>But at last I see thou art thyself a wolf.'
<A NAME="633"></A><BR><BR>Story 33
<A NAME="634"></A><BR><BR>A padshah asked a hermit: 'How spendest thou thy precious time?' 
<A NAME="635"></A>He replied: 'I am all night engaged in prayer, during the morning in supplications 
<A NAME="636"></A>and the rest of the day in restricting my expenses.' Then the king ordered 
<A NAME="637"></A>a sufficient allowance to be allotted to him so as to relieve him of the 
<A NAME="638"></A>cares of his family.
<A NAME="639"></A><BR><BR>O thou who art encumbered with a family,
<A NAME="640"></A><BR>Think no more of ever enjoying freedom.
<A NAME="641"></A><BR>Cares for children, raiment and food
<A NAME="642"></A><BR>Restrain thee from the heavenly kingdom.
<A NAME="643"></A><BR>Every day I renew my determination
<A NAME="644"></A><BR>To wait upon God until the night.
<A NAME="645"></A><BR>In the night, while tying the knot of prayer,
<A NAME="646"></A><BR>I think what my children will eat on the morrow.
<A NAME="647"></A><BR><BR>Story 34
<A NAME="648"></A><BR><BR>A man, professing to be a hermit in the desert of Syria, attended 
<A NAME="649"></A>for years to his devotions and subsisted on the leaves of trees. A padshah, 
<A NAME="650"></A>who had gone in that direction by way of pilgrimage, approached him and 
<A NAME="651"></A>said: 'If thou thinkest proper, we shall prepare a place for thee in the 
<A NAME="652"></A>town where thou wilt enjoy leisure for thy devotions and others may profit 
<A NAME="653"></A>by thy spiritual advice as well as imitate thy good works.' The hermit 
<A NAME="654"></A>refused compliance but the pillars of the State were of opinion that, in 
<A NAME="655"></A>order to please the king, he ought to spend a few days in town to ascertain 
<A NAME="656"></A>the state of the place; so that if he feared that the purity of his precious 
<A NAME="657"></A>time might become turbid by association with strangers, he would still 
<A NAME="658"></A>have the option to refuse compliance. It is related that the hermit entered 
<A NAME="659"></A>the town where a private garden-house of the king, which was a heart-expanding 
<A NAME="660"></A>and soul refreshing locality, had been prepared to receive 
<A NAME="661"></A>him.
<A NAME="662"></A><BR><BR>Its red roses were like the cheeks of belles,
<A NAME="663"></A><BR>Its hyacinths like the ringlets of mistresses
<A NAME="664"></A><BR>Protected from the inclemency of mid-winter
<A NAME="665"></A><BR>Like sucklings who have not yet tasted the nurse's 
<A NAME="666"></A>milk.
<A NAME="667"></A><BR><BR>And branches with pomegranates upon them:
<A NAME="668"></A><BR>Fire suspended from the green-trees.
<A NAME="669"></A><BR><BR>The king immediately sent him a beautiful slave-girl:
<A NAME="670"></A><BR><BR>After beholding this hermit-deceiving crescent-moon
<A NAME="671"></A><BR>Of the form of an angel and the beauty of a peacock,
<A NAME="672"></A><BR>After seeing her it would be impossible
<A NAME="673"></A><BR>To an anchorite's nature to remain patient.
<A NAME="674"></A><BR><BR>After her he sent likewise a slave-boy of wonderful beauty and 
<A NAME="675"></A>graceful placidity:
<A NAME="676"></A><BR><BR>People around him are dying with thirst
<A NAME="677"></A><BR>And he, who looks like a cupbearer, gives no drink.
<A NAME="678"></A><BR><BR>The sight cannot be satisfied by seeing him
<A NAME="679"></A><BR>Like the dropsical man near the Euphrates.
<A NAME="680"></A><BR><BR>The hermit began to eat delicious food, to wear nice clothes, to 
<A NAME="681"></A>enjoy fruit and perfumed confectionery as well as to contemplate the beauty 
<A NAME="682"></A>of the slave-boy and girl in conformity with the maxim of wise men, who 
<A NAME="683"></A>have said that the curls of belles are fetters to the feet of the intellect 
<A NAME="684"></A>and a snare to a sagacious bird.
<A NAME="685"></A><BR><BR>In thy service I lost my heart and religion with all my 
<A NAME="686"></A>learning,
<A NAME="687"></A><BR>I am indeed the sagacious bird and thou the snare.
<A NAME="688"></A><BR><BR>In short, the happiness of his former time of contentedness had 
<A NAME="689"></A>come to an end, as the saying is:
<A NAME="690"></A><BR><BR>Any faqih, pir and murid
<A NAME="691"></A><BR>Or pure minded orator,
<A NAME="692"></A><BR>Descending into the base world,
<A NAME="693"></A><BR>Sticks in the honey like a fly.
<A NAME="694"></A><BR><BR>Once the king desired to visit him but saw the hermit changed from 
<A NAME="695"></A>his former state, as he had become red, white and corpulent. When the king 
<A NAME="696"></A>entered, he beheld him reclining on a couch of gold brocade whilst the 
<A NAME="697"></A>boy and the fairy stood near his head with a fan of peacocks' feathers. 
<A NAME="698"></A>He expressed pleasure to behold the hermit in so comfortable a position, 
<A NAME="699"></A>conversed with him on many topics and said at the conclusion of the visit: 
<A NAME="700"></A>'I am afraid of these two classes of men in the world: scholars and hermits.' 
<A NAME="701"></A>The vezier, who was a philosopher and experienced in the affairs of the 
<A NAME="702"></A>world, being present, said: 'O king, the conditions of friendship require 
<A NAME="703"></A>thee to do good to both classes. Bestow gold upon scholars that they may 
<A NAME="704"></A>read more but give nothing to hermits that they may remain 
<A NAME="705"></A>hermits.'
<A NAME="706"></A><BR><BR>A hermit requires neither dirhems nor dinars.
<A NAME="707"></A><BR>If lie takes any, find another hermit.
<A NAME="708"></A><BR><BR>Who has a good behaviour and a secret with God
<A NAME="709"></A><BR>Is an anchorite without the waqfbread or begged 
<A NAME="710"></A>morsel.
<A NAME="711"></A><BR><BR>With a handsome figure and heart-ravishing ear-tip
<A NAME="712"></A><BR>A girl is a belle without turquoise-ring or pendants.
<A NAME="713"></A><BR><BR>A dervish of good behaviour and of happy disposition
<A NAME="714"></A><BR>Requires not the bread of the rebat nor the begged 
<A NAME="715"></A>morsel.
<A NAME="716"></A><BR>A lady endowed with a beauteous form and chaste 
<A NAME="717"></A>face
<A NAME="718"></A><BR>Requires no paint, adornment or turquoise-ring.
<A NAME="719"></A><BR><BR>When I have and covet more
<A NAME="720"></A><BR>It will not be proper to call me an anchorite.
<A NAME="721"></A><BR><BR>Story 35
<A NAME="722"></A><BR><BR>In conformity with the above sentiments an affair of importance 
<A NAME="723"></A>emerged to a padshah, who thereon vowed that, if it terminated according 
<A NAME="724"></A>to his wishes, he would present devotees with a certain sum of money. His 
<A NAME="725"></A>wish having been fulfilled, it became necessary to keep his promise. Accordingly 
<A NAME="726"></A>he gave a purse of dirhems to one of his confidential servants to distribute 
<A NAME="727"></A>it among recluses. It is related that the slave was intelligent and shrewd. 
<A NAME="728"></A>He walked about all day and returning at nightfall, kissed the dirhems 
<A NAME="729"></A>and deposited them before the king with the remark that he had not found 
<A NAME="730"></A>any devotees. The king rejoined: 'What nonsense is this? As far as I know 
<A NAME="731"></A>there are four hundred devotees in this town. He said: 'Lord of the world, 
<A NAME="732"></A>who is a devotee does not accept money and who accepts it is not a devotee.' 
<A NAME="733"></A>The king smiled and said to his courtiers: 'Despite of my wishing to do 
<A NAME="734"></A>good to this class of worshippers of God, this rogue bears them emnity 
<A NAME="735"></A>and thwarts my wish but truth is on his side.'
<A NAME="736"></A><BR><BR>If a devotee has taken dirhems and dinars
<A NAME="737"></A><BR>Find another who is more a devotee than he.
<A NAME="738"></A><BR><BR>Story 36
<A NAME="739"></A><BR><BR>One of the ulemma of solid learning, having been asked for his 
<A NAME="740"></A>opinion about waqfbread, answered: 'If it be accepted to insure tranquillity 
<A NAME="741"></A>of mind from cares for food and to obtain leisure for devotion, it is lawful 
<A NAME="742"></A>but if it be taken for maintenance it is forbidden.'
<A NAME="743"></A><BR><BR>Bread is taken for the corner of devotion
<A NAME="744"></A><BR>By pious men and not the corner of devotion for 
<A NAME="745"></A>bread.
<A NAME="746"></A><BR><BR>Story 37
<A NAME="747"></A><BR><BR>A dervish arrived in a place, the owner of which was of a noble 
<A NAME="748"></A>disposition, and had surrounded himself with a company of distinguished 
<A NAME="749"></A>and eloquent men, each of whom uttered something elegant or jocular, according 
<A NAME="750"></A>to the fashion of wits. The dervish who had travelled through the desert 
<A NAME="751"></A>and was fatigued had eaten nothing. One of the company asked him by way 
<A NAME="752"></A>of encouragement likewise to say something. The dervish replied: 'I do 
<A NAME="753"></A>not possess distinction and eloquence like you and have read nothing so 
<A NAME="754"></A>you must be satisfied with one distich of mine.' The company having agreed 
<A NAME="755"></A>with pleasure he recited:
<A NAME="756"></A><BR><BR>'I am hungry and opposite to a table of food
<A NAME="757"></A><BR>Like a bachelor at the door of a bath of females.'
<A NAME="758"></A><BR><BR>The company, having thus been apprised of his famished condition, 
<A NAME="759"></A>produced a table with bread but as he began to eat greedily the host said: 
<A NAME="760"></A>'Friend, at any rate stop a while till my servants roast some minced meat'; 
<A NAME="761"></A>whereon the dervish lifted his head and recited:
<A NAME="762"></A><BR><BR>'Do not order pounded meat for my table.
<A NAME="763"></A><BR>To a pounded man simple bread is pounded meat.'
<A NAME="764"></A><BR><BR>Story 38
<A NAME="765"></A><BR><BR>A murid said to his pir: 'What am I to do? I am troubled by the 
<A NAME="766"></A>people, many of whom pay me visits. By their coming and going they encroach 
<A NAME="767"></A>upon my precious time.' He replied: 'Lend something to every one of them 
<A NAME="768"></A>who is poor and ask something from every one who is rich and they will 
<A NAME="769"></A>come round thee no more.'
<A NAME="770"></A><BR><BR>If a mendicant were the leader of the army of 
<A NAME="771"></A>Islam,
<A NAME="772"></A><BR>The infidels would for fear of his importunity run as far as 
<A NAME="773"></A>China.
<A NAME="774"></A><BR><BR>Story 39
<A NAME="775"></A><BR><BR>The son of a faqih said to his father: 'These heart-ravishing words 
<A NAME="776"></A>of moralists make no impression upon me because I do not see that their 
<A NAME="777"></A>actions are in conformity with their speeches.'
<A NAME="778"></A><BR><BR>They teach people to abandon the world
<A NAME="779"></A><BR>But themselves accumulate silver and corn.
<A NAME="780"></A><BR>A scholar who only preaches and nothing more
<A NAME="781"></A><BR>Will not impress anyone when he speaks.
<A NAME="782"></A><BR>He is a scholar who commits no evil,
<A NAME="783"></A><BR>Not he who speaks to men but acts not himself.
<A NAME="784"></A><BR><BR>Will you enjoin virtue to mankind and forget your own 
<A NAME="785"></A>souls?
<A NAME="786"></A><BR><BR>A scholar who follows his lusts and panders to his 
<A NAME="787"></A>body
<A NAME="788"></A><BR>Is himself lost although he may show the way.
<A NAME="789"></A><BR><BR>The father replied: 'My son, it is not proper merely on account 
<A NAME="790"></A>of this vain fancy to turn away the face from the instruction of advisers, 
<A NAME="791"></A>to travel on the road of vanity, to accuse the ullemma of aberration, and 
<A NAME="792"></A>whilst searching for an immaculate scholar, to remain excluded from the 
<A NAME="793"></A>benefits of knowledge, like a blind man who one night fell into the mud 
<A NAME="794"></A>and shouted: "O Musalmans, hold a lamp on my path." Whereon a courtesan 
<A NAME="795"></A>who heard him asked: "As thou canst not see the lamp, what wilt thou see 
<A NAME="796"></A>with the lamp?" In the same way the preaching assembly is like the shop 
<A NAME="797"></A>of a dealer in linen because if thou bringest no money thou canst obtain 
<A NAME="798"></A>no wares and if thou bringest no inclination to the assembly thou wilt 
<A NAME="799"></A>not get any felicity.'
<A NAME="800"></A><BR><BR>He said: 'Listen with thy soul's ear to a scholar
<A NAME="801"></A><BR>Although his actions may not be like his doctrines.'
<A NAME="802"></A><BR>In vain does the gainsayer ask:
<A NAME="803"></A><BR>'How can a sleeper awaken a sleeper?
<A NAME="804"></A><BR>A man must receive into his ears
<A NAME="805"></A><BR>The advice although it be written on a wall.'
<A NAME="806"></A><BR><BR>A pious man came to the door of a college from a 
<A NAME="807"></A>monastery.
<A NAME="808"></A><BR>He broke the covenant of the company of those of the 
<A NAME="809"></A>Tariq.
<A NAME="810"></A><BR>I asked him what the difference between a scholar and a 
<A NAME="811"></A>monk
<A NAME="812"></A><BR>amounts to?
<A NAME="813"></A><BR>He replied: 'The former saves his blanket from the 
<A NAME="814"></A>waves
<A NAME="815"></A><BR>Whilst the latter strives to save the drowning man.'
<A NAME="816"></A><BR><BR>Story 40
<A NAME="817"></A><BR><BR>A man was sleeping dead-drunk on the highway and the bridle of 
<A NAME="818"></A>spontaneity had slipped from his hands. A hermit passed near him and considered 
<A NAME="819"></A>the disgraceful condition he was in. The youth raised his head and recited: 
<A NAME="820"></A>When they passed near something contemptible, they passed it kindly. When 
<A NAME="821"></A>thou beholdest a sinner be concealing and meek.
<A NAME="822"></A><BR><BR>Turn not thy face from a sinner, O anchorite.
<A NAME="823"></A><BR>Look upon him with benignity.
<A NAME="824"></A><BR>If I am ignoble in my actions
<A NAME="825"></A><BR>Pass me by like a noble fellow.
<A NAME="826"></A><BR><BR>Story 41
<A NAME="827"></A><BR><BR>A company of vagabonds met a dervish, spoke insulting words to 
<A NAME="828"></A>him, struck him and otherwise molested him; whereon he complained to his 
<A NAME="829"></A>superior and explained the case. The pir replied: 'My son, the patched 
<A NAME="830"></A>frock of dervishes is the garment of resignation and who, wearing it, cannot 
<A NAME="831"></A>bear injuries is a pretender not entitled to the frock.'
<A NAME="832"></A><BR><BR>A large river will not become turbid from stones.
<A NAME="833"></A><BR>The Arif who feels aggrieved is shallow water yet.
<A NAME="834"></A><BR><BR>If he injures thee, bear it

<A NAME="836"></A><BR>O brother, as the end is dust, be dust before thou

<A NAME="839"></A><BR><BR>Story 42
<A NAME="840"></A><BR><BR>Listen to this story how in Baghdad
<A NAME="841"></A><BR>A flag and a curtain fell into dispute.
<A NAME="842"></A><BR>Travel stained, dusty and fatigued, the flag
<A NAME="843"></A><BR>Said to the curtain by way of reproach:
<A NAME="844"></A><BR>'I and thou, we are both fellow servants,
<A NAME="845"></A><BR>Slaves of the sultan's palace.
<A NAME="846"></A><BR>Not a moment had I rest from service
<A NAME="847"></A><BR>In season and out of season I travelled about.
<A NAME="848"></A><BR>Thou hast suffered neither toil nor siege,
<A NAME="849"></A><BR>Not from the desert, wind, nor dust and dirt.
<A NAME="850"></A><BR>My step in the march is more advancing.
<A NAME="851"></A><BR>Then why is thy honour exceeding mine?
<A NAME="852"></A><BR>Thou art upon moon-faced servants
<A NAME="853"></A><BR>Or jessamine scented slave girls.
<A NAME="854"></A><BR>I have fallen into prentice hands.
<A NAME="855"></A><BR>I travel with foot in fetters and head fluttering.'
<A NAME="856"></A><BR>The curtain said: 'My head is on the threshold
<A NAME="857"></A><BR>Not like thine in the heavens.
<A NAME="858"></A><BR>Who carelessly lifts up his neck
<A NAME="859"></A><BR>Throws himself upon his neck.'
<A NAME="860"></A><BR><BR>Story 43
<A NAME="861"></A><BR><BR>A pious man saw an acrobat in great dudgeon, full of wrath and 
<A NAME="862"></A>foaming at the mouth. He asked: 'What is the matter with this fellow?' 
<A NAME="863"></A>A bystander said: 'Someone has insulted him.' He remarked: 'This base wretch 
<A NAME="864"></A>is able to lift a thousand mann of stones and has not the power to bear 
<A NAME="865"></A>one word.'
<A NAME="866"></A><BR><BR>Abandon thy claim to strength and manliness.
<A NAME="867"></A><BR>Thou art weak-minded and base, whether thou be a man or 
<A NAME="868"></A>woman.
<A NAME="869"></A><BR>If thou art able, make a sweet mouth.
<A NAME="870"></A><BR>It is not manliness to strike the fist on a mouth.
<A NAME="871"></A><BR><BR>Although able to tear up an elephant's front
<A NAME="872"></A><BR>He is not a man who possessed no humanity.
<A NAME="873"></A><BR>A man's nature is of earth.
<A NAME="874"></A><BR>If he is not humble he is not a man.
<A NAME="875"></A><BR><BR>Story 44
<A NAME="876"></A><BR><BR>I asked a good man concerning the qualities of the brethren of 
<A NAME="877"></A>purity. He replied: 'The least of them is that they prefer to please their 
<A NAME="878"></A>friends rather than themselves; and philosophers have said that a brother 
<A NAME="879"></A>who is fettered by affairs relating to himself is neither a brother nor 
<A NAME="880"></A>a relative.'
<A NAME="881"></A><BR><BR>If thy fellow traveller hastens, he is not thy 
<A NAME="882"></A>fellow.
<A NAME="883"></A><BR>Tie not thy heart to one whose heart is not tied to 
<A NAME="884"></A>thine.
<A NAME="885"></A><BR>When a kinsman possesses no virtue and piety
<A NAME="886"></A><BR>Then severing connection is better than love of 
<A NAME="887"></A>kinship.
<A NAME="888"></A><BR><BR>I remember that an opponent objected to the last two lines, saying: 
<A NAME="889"></A>'God the most high and glorious has in his noble book prohibited the severing 
<A NAME="890"></A>of connection with relatives and has commanded us to love them. What thou 
<A NAME="891"></A>hast alleged is contrary to it.' I replied: 'Thou art mistaken because 
<A NAME="892"></A>according to the Quran, Allah the most high has said: If they both father 
<A NAME="893"></A>and mother, strive to induce thee to associate with me that concerning 
<A NAME="894"></A>which thou hast no knowledge, obey them not.
<A NAME="895"></A><BR><BR>A thousand kinsmen who are strangers to God
<A NAME="896"></A><BR>Are the sacrifice for one stranger who knows him.

<A NAME="916"></A><BR><BR>At last it became necessary to marry her to a blind man and it 
<A NAME="917"></A>is related that on the said occasion a physician arrived from Serandip 
<A NAME="918"></A>who was able to restore sight to the blind. The faqih, being asked why 
<A NAME="919"></A>he had not put his son-in-law under treatment, replied: 'I fear that if 
<A NAME="920"></A>he is able to see he will divorce my daughter.'
<A NAME="921"></A><BR><BR>It is better if the husband of an ugly woman is 
<A NAME="922"></A>blind.
<A NAME="923"></A><BR><BR>Story 47
<A NAME="924"></A><BR><BR>A padshah was casting a glanced of contempt upon a company of dervishes 
<A NAME="925"></A>and one of them, understanding by his sagacity the meaning of it, said: 
<A NAME="926"></A>'O king, in this world we are inferior to thee in dignity but more happy 
<A NAME="927"></A>in life. In death we are equal and in the resurrection superior to 
<A NAME="928"></A>thee.'
<A NAME="929"></A><BR><BR>Though the master of a country may have enjoyment
<A NAME="930"></A><BR>And the dervish may be in need of bread
<A NAME="931"></A><BR>In that hour when both of them will die
<A NAME="932"></A><BR>They will take from the world not more than a shroud.
<A NAME="933"></A><BR>When thou takest thy departure from the realm
<A NAME="934"></A><BR>It will be better to be a mendicant than a padshah.
<A NAME="935"></A><BR><BR>Externally the dervish shows a patched robe and a shaved head but 
<A NAME="936"></A>in reality his heart is living and his lust dead.
<A NAME="937"></A><BR><BR>He does not sit at the door of pretence away from 
<A NAME="938"></A>people
<A NAME="939"></A><BR>To fight against them if they oppose him
<A NAME="940"></A><BR>Because when a millstone rolls from a mountain
<A NAME="941"></A><BR>He is not an A'rif who gets out of the way of the 
<A NAME="942"></A>stone.
<A NAME="943"></A><BR><BR>The way of dervishes is praying, gratitude, service, obedience, 
<A NAME="944"></A>almsgiving, contentment, professing the unity of God, trust, submission 
<A NAME="945"></A>and patience. Whoever possesses these qualities is really a dervish, although 
<A NAME="946"></A>he may wear an elegant robe, whereas a prattler who neglects his orisons, 
<A NAME="947"></A>is luxurious, sensual, turns day into night in the bondage of lust, and 
<A NAME="948"></A>night into day in the sleep of carelessness, eats whatever he gets, and 
<A NAME="949"></A>speaks whatever comes upon his tongue, is a profligate, although he may 
<A NAME="950"></A>wear the habit of a dervish.
<A NAME="951"></A><BR><BR>O thou whose interior is denuded of piety
<A NAME="952"></A><BR>But wearest outwardly the garb of hypocrisy
<A NAME="953"></A><BR>Do not display a curtain of seven colours.
<A NAME="954"></A><BR>Thou hast reed mats inside thy house.
<A NAME="955"></A><BR><BR>Story 48
<A NAME="956"></A><BR><BR>I saw bouquets of fresh roses
<A NAME="957"></A><BR>Tied upon a cupola of grass.
<A NAME="958"></A><BR>I asked: 'What is despicable grass
<A NAME="959"></A><BR>To sit also in the line of the roses?'
<A NAME="960"></A><BR>The grass wept and said: 'Hush!
<A NAME="961"></A><BR>Companionship does not obliterate nobility.
<A NAME="962"></A><BR>Although I have no beauty, colour and perfume,
<A NAME="963"></A><BR>Am I not after all the grass of his garden?
<A NAME="964"></A><BR>I am the slave of a bountiful lord,
<A NAME="965"></A><BR>Cherished from old by his liberality.
<A NAME="966"></A><BR>Whether I possess virtue or not
<A NAME="967"></A><BR>I hope for grace from the Lord
<A NAME="968"></A><BR>Although I possess no property
<A NAME="969"></A><BR>No capital to offer as obedience.
<A NAME="970"></A><BR>He knows the remedy for the slave
<A NAME="971"></A><BR>To whom no support remains.
<A NAME="972"></A><BR>It is customary that the owner gives a writ
<A NAME="973"></A><BR>Of emancipation to an old slave.
<A NAME="974"></A><BR>O God, who hast adorned the universe,
<A NAME="975"></A><BR>Be bountiful to thy old slave.'
<A NAME="976"></A><BR>Sa'di, take the road to the Ka'bah of submission.
<A NAME="977"></A><BR>O man of God, follow the way of God.
<A NAME="978"></A><BR>Unlucky is he who turns his head
<A NAME="979"></A><BR>Away from this door for he will find no other door.
<A NAME="980"></A><BR><BR>Story 49
<A NAME="981"></A><BR><BR>A sage having been asked whether liberality or bravery is better 
<A NAME="982"></A>replied: 'He who possesses liberality needs no bravery.'
<A NAME="983"></A><BR><BR>It is written on the tomb of Behram Gur:
<A NAME="984"></A><BR>'A liberal hand is better than a strong arm.'
<A NAME="985"></A><BR><BR>Hatim Tai has passed away but for ever
<A NAME="986"></A><BR>His high name will remain celebrated for beneficence.
<A NAME="987"></A><BR>Set aside the zekat from thy property because the exuberant 
<A NAME="988"></A>vines
<A NAME="989"></A><BR>When pruned by the vintner will yield more grapes.
