<A NAME="10"></A><B>On Rules for Conduct in Life</B>
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="11"></A>Maxim 1
<A NAME="12"></A><BR><BR>Property is for the comfort of life, not for the accumulation of 
<A NAME="13"></A>wealth. A sage, having been asked who is lucky and who is not, replied: 
<A NAME="14"></A>'He is lucky who has eaten and sowed but he is unlucky who has died and 
<A NAME="15"></A>not enjoyed.'
<A NAME="16"></A><BR><BR>Pray not for the nobody who has done nothing,
<A NAME="17"></A><BR>Who spent his life in accumulating property but
<A NAME="18"></A><BR>has not enjoyed it.
<A NAME="19"></A><BR><BR>Moses, upon whom be peace, thus advised Quran: 'Do thou good as 
<A NAME="20"></A>Allah has done unto thee.' But he would not listen and thou hast heard 
<A NAME="21"></A>of his end:
<A NAME="22"></A><BR><BR>Who has not accumulated good with dirhems and 
<A NAME="23"></A>dinars
<A NAME="24"></A><BR>Has staked his end upon his dirhems and dinars.
<A NAME="25"></A><BR>If thou desirest to profit by riches of the world
<A NAME="26"></A><BR>Be liberal to mankind as God has been liberal to 
<A NAME="27"></A>thee.
<A NAME="28"></A><BR><BR>The Arab says: Be liberal without imposing obligations and verily 
<A NAME="29"></A>the profit will return to thee.
<A NAME="30"></A><BR><BR>Wherever the tree of beneficence has taken root
<A NAME="31"></A><BR>Its tallness and branches pass beyond the sky.
<A NAME="32"></A><BR>If thou art desirous to eat the fruit thereof
<A NAME="33"></A><BR>Do not put a saw to its foot by imposing obligations.
<A NAME="34"></A><BR><BR>Thank God that thou hast been divinely aided
<A NAME="35"></A><BR>And not excluded from his gifts and bounty.
<A NAME="36"></A><BR>Think not thou conferrest an obligation on the sultan by serving 
<A NAME="37"></A>him
<A NAME="38"></A><BR>But be obliged to him for having kept thee in his 
<A NAME="39"></A>service.
<A NAME="40"></A><BR><BR>Maxim 2
<A NAME="41"></A><BR><BR>Two men took useless trouble and strove without any profit, when 
<A NAME="42"></A>one of them accumulated property without enjoying it, and the other learnt 
<A NAME="43"></A>without practising what he had learnt.
<A NAME="44"></A><BR><BR>However much science thou mayest acquire
<A NAME="45"></A><BR>Thou art ignorant when there is no practice in thee.
<A NAME="46"></A><BR>Neither deeply learned nor a scholar will be
<A NAME="47"></A><BR>A quadruped loaded with some books.
<A NAME="48"></A><BR>What information or knowledge does the silly beast 
<A NAME="49"></A>posses
<A NAME="50"></A><BR>Whether it is carrying a load of wood or of books?
<A NAME="51"></A><BR><BR>Maxim 3
<A NAME="52"></A><BR><BR>Knowledge is for the cherishing of religion, not for amassing 
<A NAME="53"></A>wealth.
<A NAME="54"></A><BR><BR>Who sold abstinence, knowledge and piety
<A NAME="55"></A><BR>Filled a granary but burnt it clean away.
<A NAME="56"></A><BR><BR>Maxim 4
<A NAME="57"></A><BR><BR>A learned man who is not abstinent resembles a torchbearer who 
<A NAME="58"></A>guides others but does not guide himself.
<A NAME="59"></A><BR><BR>Who has spent a profitless life
<A NAME="60"></A><BR>Bought nothing and threw away his gold.
<A NAME="61"></A><BR><BR>Maxim 5
<A NAME="62"></A><BR><BR>The country is adorned by intelligent and the religion by virtuous 
<A NAME="63"></A>men. Padshahs stand more in need of the advice of intelligent men than 
<A NAME="64"></A>intelligent men of the proximity of padshahs.
<A NAME="65"></A><BR><BR>If thou wilt listen to advice, padshah,
<A NAME="66"></A><BR>There is none better in all books than this:
<A NAME="67"></A><BR>'Entrust a business to an intelligent man
<A NAME="68"></A><BR>Although it may not be his occupation.'
<A NAME="69"></A><BR><BR>Maxim 6
<A NAME="70"></A><BR><BR>Three things cannot subsist without three things: property without 
<A NAME="71"></A>trade, science without controversy and a country without 
<A NAME="72"></A>punishment.
<A NAME="73"></A><BR><BR>Speak sometimes in a friendly, conciliatory, manly 
<A NAME="74"></A>way
<A NAME="75"></A><BR>Perhaps thou wilt ensnare a heart with the lasso.
<A NAME="76"></A><BR>Sometimes speak in anger; for a hundred jars of 
<A NAME="77"></A>sugar
<A NAME="78"></A><BR>Will on occasion not have the effect of one dose of 
<A NAME="79"></A>colocynth.
<A NAME="80"></A><BR><BR>Maxim 7
<A NAME="81"></A><BR><BR>To have mercy upon the bad is to injure the good; to pardon tyrants 
<A NAME="82"></A>is to do violence to dervishes.
<A NAME="83"></A><BR><BR>If thou associatest and art friendly with a 
<A NAME="84"></A>wretch
<A NAME="85"></A><BR>He will commit sin with thy wealth and make thee his 
<A NAME="86"></A>partner.
<A NAME="87"></A><BR><BR>Admonition 1
<A NAME="88"></A><BR><BR>The amity of princes and the sweet voice of children are not to 
<A NAME="89"></A>be trusted, because the former is changed by fancy and the latter in the 
<A NAME="90"></A>course of one night.
<A NAME="91"></A><BR><BR>Give not thy heart to a sweetheart of a thousand 
<A NAME="92"></A>lovers,
<A NAME="93"></A><BR>And if thou givest it, thou givest that heart for 
<A NAME="94"></A>separation.
<A NAME="95"></A><BR><BR>Admonition 2
<A NAME="96"></A><BR><BR>Confide not to a friend every secret thou possessest. How knowest 
<A NAME="97"></A>thou that he will not some time become thy foe? Inflict not every injury 
<A NAME="98"></A>thou canst upon an enemy because it is possible that one day he may become 
<A NAME="99"></A>thy friend.
<A NAME="100"></A><BR><BR>Admonition 3
<A NAME="101"></A><BR><BR>Reveal not thy secret to any man although he may be trustworthy, 
<A NAME="102"></A>because no one can keep thy secret better than thyself.
<A NAME="103"></A><BR><BR>Silence is preferable than to tell thy mind
<A NAME="104"></A><BR>To anyone; saying what is to remain unsaid.
<A NAME="105"></A><BR>O simpleton, stop the source of the spring.
<A NAME="106"></A><BR>When it becomes full, the brook cannot be stopped.
<A NAME="107"></A><BR><BR>Maxim 8
<A NAME="108"></A><BR><BR>A weak foe, who professes submission and shows friendship, has 
<A NAME="109"></A>no other object than to become a strong enemy. It has been said that as 
<A NAME="110"></A>the friendship of friends is unreliable, what trust can be put in the flattery 
<A NAME="111"></A>of enemies?
<A NAME="112"></A><BR><BR>Admonition 4
<A NAME="113"></A><BR><BR>Who despises an insignificant enemy resembles him who is careless 
<A NAME="114"></A>about fire.
<A NAME="115"></A><BR><BR>Extinguish it today, while it may be quenched,
<A NAME="116"></A><BR>Because when fire is high, it burns the world.
<A NAME="117"></A><BR>Allow not the bow to be spanned
<A NAME="118"></A><BR>By a foe because an arrow may pierce.
<A NAME="119"></A><BR><BR>Admonition 5
<A NAME="120"></A><BR><BR>Speak so between two enemies that thou mayest not be put to shame 
<A NAME="121"></A>if they become friends.
<A NAME="122"></A><BR><BR>Between two men contention is like fire,
<A NAME="123"></A><BR>The ill-starred back-biter being the wood-carrier.
<A NAME="124"></A><BR>When both of them become friends again
<A NAME="125"></A><BR>He will among them be unhappy and ashamed.
<A NAME="126"></A><BR>To kindle fire between two men
<A NAME="127"></A><BR>Is not wise but is to burn oneself therein.
<A NAME="128"></A><BR><BR>Converse in whispers with thy friends
<A NAME="129"></A><BR>Lest thy sanguinary foe may hear thee.
<A NAME="130"></A><BR>Take care of what thou sayest in front of a wall
<A NAME="131"></A><BR>Because an ear may be behind the wall.
<A NAME="132"></A><BR><BR>Admonition 6
<A NAME="133"></A><BR><BR>Whoever makes peace with the enemies of his friends greatly injures 
<A NAME="134"></A>his friends.
<A NAME="135"></A><BR><BR>Wash thy hands, O wise man, from a friend
<A NAME="136"></A><BR>Who is sitting together with thy foes.
<A NAME="137"></A><BR><BR>Admonition 7
<A NAME="138"></A><BR><BR>When thou art uncertain in transacting an affair, select that portion 
<A NAME="139"></A>of it which will entail no danger to thee.
<A NAME="140"></A><BR><BR>Speak not harshly to a man of gentle speech.
<A NAME="141"></A><BR>Seek not to fight with him who knocks at the door of 
<A NAME="142"></A>peace.
<A NAME="143"></A><BR><BR>Admonition 8
<A NAME="144"></A><BR><BR>As long as an affair can be arranged with gold, it is not proper 
<A NAME="145"></A>to endanger life.
<A NAME="146"></A><BR><BR>When the hand is foiled in every stratagem
<A NAME="147"></A><BR>It is licit to put the hand to the sword.
<A NAME="148"></A><BR><BR>Admonition 9
<A NAME="149"></A><BR><BR>Do not pity the weakness of a foe because when he gains strength 
<A NAME="150"></A>he will not spare thee.
<A NAME="151"></A><BR><BR>Boast not of thy moustaches when thou seest thy foe is 
<A NAME="152"></A>weak.
<A NAME="153"></A><BR>There is marrow in every bone, a man in every coat.
<A NAME="154"></A><BR><BR>Maxim 9
<A NAME="155"></A><BR><BR>Whoever slays a bad fellow saves mankind from a calamity and him 
<A NAME="156"></A>from the wrath of God.
<A NAME="157"></A><BR><BR>Condonation is laudable but nevertheless
<A NAME="158"></A><BR>Apply no salve to the wound of an oppressor of the 
<A NAME="159"></A>people.
<A NAME="160"></A><BR>He who had mercy upon a serpent
<A NAME="161"></A><BR>Knew not that it was an injury to the sons of Adam.
<A NAME="162"></A><BR><BR>Maxim 10
<A NAME="163"></A><BR><BR>It is a mistake to accept advice from an enemy but permissible 
<A NAME="164"></A>to hear it; and to act contrary to it is perfectly correct.
<A NAME="165"></A><BR><BR>Be cautious of what a foe tells thee to do
<A NAME="166"></A><BR>Lest thou strike thy knee with the hand of pain.
<A NAME="167"></A><BR>If he points thy way to the right like an arrow
<A NAME="168"></A><BR>Deflect therefrom and take that to the left hand.
<A NAME="169"></A><BR><BR>Admonition 10
<A NAME="170"></A><BR><BR>Wrath beyond measure produces estrangement and untimely kindness 
<A NAME="171"></A>destroys authority. Be neither so harsh as to disgust the people with thee 
<A NAME="172"></A>nor so mild as to embolden them.
<A NAME="173"></A><BR><BR>Severity and mildness together are best
<A NAME="174"></A><BR>Like a bleeder who is a surgeon and also applies a 
<A NAME="175"></A>salve.
<A NAME="176"></A><BR>A wise man uses neither severity to excess
<A NAME="177"></A><BR>Nor mildness; for it lessens his authority.
<A NAME="178"></A><BR>He neither exalts himself too much
<A NAME="179"></A><BR>Nor exposes himself at once to contempt.
<A NAME="180"></A><BR><BR>A youth said to his father: 'O wise man,
<A NAME="181"></A><BR>Give me for instruction one advice like an aged 
<A NAME="182"></A>person.'
<A NAME="183"></A><BR>He said: 'Be kind but not to such a degree
<A NAME="184"></A><BR>That a sharp-toothed wolf may become audacious.'
<A NAME="185"></A><BR><BR>Maxim 11
<A NAME="186"></A><BR><BR>May that prince never govern a kingdom
<A NAME="187"></A><BR>Who is not an obedient slave to God.
<A NAME="188"></A><BR><BR>Admonition 11
<A NAME="189"></A><BR><BR>It is incumbent upon a padshah to give way to anger towards his 
<A NAME="190"></A>slaves only so far as to retain the confidence of his friends. The fire 
<A NAME="191"></A>of anger first burns him who has given cause for it and afterwards the 
<A NAME="192"></A>flame may or may not reach the foe.
<A NAME="193"></A><BR><BR>It is not proper for sons of Adam born of earth
<A NAME="194"></A><BR>To inflate their heads with pride, violence and 
<A NAME="195"></A>wind.
<A NAME="196"></A><BR>Thou who displayest so much heat and obstinacy
<A NAME="197"></A><BR>Must be, I think, not of earth but of fire.
<A NAME="198"></A><BR><BR>I visited a hermit in the country of Bilqan
<A NAME="199"></A><BR>And requested him to purge me of ignorance by instruction.
<A NAME="200"></A><BR>He replied: 'Be patient like earth, O lawyer,
<A NAME="201"></A><BR>Or else, bury under the earth all thy learning.'
<A NAME="202"></A><BR><BR>Maxim 12
<A NAME="203"></A><BR>An ill-humoured man is captive in the hands of a foe, from the grasp 
<A NAME="204"></A>of whose punishment he cannot be delivered wherever he may 
<A NAME="205"></A>go.
<A NAME="206"></A><BR><BR>If from the hand of calamity an ill-natured man escapes into the 
<A NAME="207"></A>sky
<A NAME="208"></A><BR>The evil disposition of his own nature retains him in 
<A NAME="209"></A>calamity.
<A NAME="210"></A><BR><BR>Admonition 12
<A NAME="211"></A><BR><BR>When thou perceivest that discord is in the army of the foe, be 
<A NAME="212"></A>thou at ease; but if they are united, be apprehensive of thy own 
<A NAME="213"></A>distress.
<A NAME="214"></A><BR><BR>Go and sit in repose with thy friends
<A NAME="215"></A><BR>When thou seest war among the enemies;
<A NAME="216"></A><BR>But if thou perceivest that they all agree
<A NAME="217"></A><BR>Span thy bow and carry stones upon the rampart.
<A NAME="218"></A><BR><BR>Maxim 13
<A NAME="219"></A><BR><BR>When all the artifices of an enemy have failed he shakes the chain 
<A NAME="220"></A>of friendship, and thereon performs acts of friendship which no enemy is 
<A NAME="221"></A>able to do.
<A NAME="222"></A><BR><BR>Admonition 13
<A NAME="223"></A><BR><BR>Strike the head of a serpent with the hand of a foe because one 
<A NAME="224"></A>of two advantages will result. If the enemy succeeds thou hast killed the 
<A NAME="225"></A>snake and if the latter, thou hast been delivered from a 
<A NAME="226"></A>foe.
<A NAME="227"></A><BR><BR>Advice
<A NAME="228"></A><BR><BR>If thou art aware of news which will grieve a heart, remain silent 
<A NAME="229"></A>that others may convey it.
<A NAME="230"></A><BR><BR>Nightingale, bring tidings of spring.
<A NAME="231"></A><BR>Leave bad news to the owl.
<A NAME="232"></A><BR><BR>Caution
<A NAME="233"></A><BR><BR>Give not information to a padshah of the treachery of anyone, unless 
<A NAME="234"></A>thou art sure he will accept it; else thou wilt only be preparing thy own 
<A NAME="235"></A>destruction.
<A NAME="236"></A><BR><BR>Prepare to speak only when
<A NAME="237"></A><BR>Thy words are likely to have effect.
<A NAME="238"></A><BR>Speech is a perfection in the soul of man
<A NAME="239"></A><BR>But do not ruin thyself by speaking.
<A NAME="240"></A><BR><BR>Maxim 14
<A NAME="241"></A><BR><BR>Whoever gives advice to a self-willed man stands himself in need 
<A NAME="242"></A>of advice.
<A NAME="243"></A><BR><BR>Admonition 14
<A NAME="244"></A><BR><BR>Swallow not the deception of a foe. Purchase not conceit from a 
<A NAME="245"></A>panegyrist. The one has laid out a snare for provisions and the other has 
<A NAME="246"></A>opened the jaws of covetousness.
<A NAME="247"></A><BR><BR>Maxim 15
<A NAME="248"></A><BR><BR>A fool is pleased by flattery like the inflated heel of a corpse 
<A NAME="249"></A>that has the appearance of fatness.
<A NAME="250"></A><BR><BR>Take care not to listen to the voice of a flatterer
<A NAME="251"></A><BR>Who expects cheaply to derive profit from thee.
<A NAME="252"></A><BR>If one day thou failest to satisfy his wishes
<A NAME="253"></A><BR>He enumerates two hundred faults of thine.
<A NAME="254"></A><BR><BR>Maxim 16
<A NAME="255"></A><BR><BR>Unless an orator's defects are mentioned by someone, his good points 
<A NAME="256"></A>will not be praised.
<A NAME="257"></A><BR><BR>Be not proud of the beauty of thy speech,
<A NAME="258"></A><BR>Of the approbation of an ignoramus and of thy own 
<A NAME="259"></A>opinion.
<A NAME="260"></A><BR><BR>Maxim 17
<A NAME="261"></A><BR><BR>Everyone thinks himself perfect in intellect and his child in 
<A NAME="262"></A>beauty.
<A NAME="263"></A><BR><BR>A Jew was debating with a Musalman
<A NAME="264"></A><BR>Till I shook with laughter at their dispute.
<A NAME="265"></A><BR>The Moslem said in anger: 'If this deed of mine
<A NAME="266"></A><BR>Is not correct, may God cause me to die a Jew.'
<A NAME="267"></A><BR>The Jew said: 'I swear by the Pentateuch
<A NAME="268"></A><BR>That if my oath is false, I shall die a Moslem like 
<A NAME="269"></A>thee.'
<A NAME="270"></A><BR>Should from the surface of the earth wisdom disappear
<A NAME="271"></A><BR>Still no one will acknowledge his own ignorance.
<A NAME="272"></A><BR><BR>Maxim 18
<A NAME="273"></A><BR><BR>Ten men eat at a table but two dogs will contend for one piece 
<A NAME="274"></A>of carrion. A greedy person will stir be hungry with the whole world, whilst 
<A NAME="275"></A>a contented man will be satisfied with one bread. Wise men have said that 
<A NAME="276"></A>poverty with content is better than wealth and not abundance.
<A NAME="277"></A><BR><BR>Narrow intestines may be filled with dry bread
<A NAME="278"></A><BR>But the wealth of the surface of the world will not fill a 
<A NAME="279"></A>greedy
<A NAME="280"></A><BR>eye.
<A NAME="281"></A><BR><BR>When the term of my father's life had come to an 
<A NAME="282"></A>end
<A NAME="283"></A><BR>He gave me this one advice and passed away:
<A NAME="284"></A><BR>Lust is fire, abstain therefrom,
<A NAME="285"></A><BR>Make not the fire of hell sharp for thee.

<A NAME="637"></A><BR><BR>Say to the rude and unkind bee,

<A NAME="639"></A><BR><BR>Maxim 51
<A NAME="640"></A><BR><BR>A man without virility is a woman and an avaricious devote is a 
<A NAME="641"></A>highway robber.
<A NAME="642"></A><BR><BR>O thou, who hast put on a white robe for a show,
<A NAME="643"></A><BR>To be approved of men, whilst the book of thy acts is 
<A NAME="644"></A>black.
<A NAME="645"></A><BR>The hand is to be restrained from the world,

<A NAME="648"></A><BR><BR>Regret will not leave the hearts of two persons and their feet 
<A NAME="649"></A>of contention will not emerge from the mire: a merchant with a wrecked 
<A NAME="650"></A>ship and a youth sitting with qalandars.
<A NAME="651"></A><BR><BR>Dervishes will consider it licit to shed thy 
<A NAME="652"></A>blood
<A NAME="653"></A><BR>If they can have no access to thy property.
<A NAME="654"></A><BR>Either associate not with a friend who dons the blue 
<A NAME="655"></A>garb,
<A NAME="656"></A><BR>Or bid farewell to all thy property.
<A NAME="657"></A><BR>Either make no friends with elephant-keepers
<A NAME="658"></A><BR>Or build a house suitable for elephants.
<A NAME="659"></A><BR><BR>Maxim 53
<A NAME="660"></A><BR><BR>Although a sultan's garment of honour is dear yet one's own old 
<A NAME="661"></A>robe is more dear; and though the food of a great man may be delicious, 
<A NAME="662"></A>the broken crumbs of one's own sack are more delicious.
<A NAME="663"></A><BR><BR>Vinegar by one's own labour and vegetables
<A NAME="664"></A><BR>Are better than bread received as alms, and veal.
<A NAME="665"></A><BR><BR>Maxim 54
<A NAME="666"></A><BR><BR>It is contrary to what is proper, and against the opinion of to 
<A NAME="667"></A>partake of medicine by guess and to go after a caravan without seeing the 
<A NAME="668"></A>road. The Imam Murshid Muhammad Ghazali, upon whom be the mercy of Allah, 
<A NAME="669"></A>having been asked in what manner he had attained such a degree of knowledge, 
<A NAME="670"></A>replied: 'By not being ashamed to ask about things I did not 
<A NAME="671"></A>know.'
<A NAME="672"></A><BR><BR>The hope of recovery is according to reason,
<A NAME="673"></A><BR>That he should feel thy pulse who knows thy nature.
<A NAME="674"></A><BR>Ask what thou knowest not; for the trouble of asking
<A NAME="675"></A><BR>Will indicate to thee the way to the dignity of 
<A NAME="676"></A>knowledge.
<A NAME="677"></A><BR><BR>Admonition 21
<A NAME="678"></A><BR><BR>Whatever thou perceivest will become known to thee in due course 
<A NAME="679"></A>of time. Make no haste in asking for it, else the awe of thy dignity will 
<A NAME="680"></A>be lessened.
<A NAME="681"></A><BR><BR>When Loqman saw that in the hands of David
<A NAME="682"></A><BR>All iron became by miracle soft like wax,
<A NAME="683"></A><BR>He asked not: 'What art thou doing?' Because
<A NAME="684"></A><BR>He knew he would learn it without asking.
<A NAME="685"></A><BR><BR>Maxim 55
<A NAME="686"></A><BR><BR>One of the requirements for society is to attend to the affairs 
<A NAME="687"></A>of thy household and also at the house of God.
<A NAME="688"></A><BR><BR>Tell thy tale according to thy hearer's temper,
<A NAME="689"></A><BR>If thou knowest him to be biased to thee.
<A NAME="690"></A><BR>Every wise man who sits with Mejnun

<A NAME="693"></A><BR><BR>Anyone associating with bad people, although their nature may not 
<A NAME="694"></A>infect his own, is supposed to follow their ways to such a degree that 
<A NAME="695"></A>if he goes to a tavern to say his prayers, he will be supposed to do so 
<A NAME="696"></A>for drinking wine.
<A NAME="697"></A><BR><BR>Thou hast branded thyself with the mark of ignorance,
<A NAME="698"></A><BR>When thou hast selected an ignoramus for thy companion.
<A NAME="699"></A><BR>I asked some scholars for a piece of advice.
<A NAME="700"></A><BR>They said: 'Connect thyself not with an ignorant 
<A NAME="701"></A>man,
<A NAME="702"></A><BR>For if thou be learned, thou wilt be an ass in course of 
<A NAME="703"></A>time

<A NAME="705"></A><BR><BR>Maxim 57
<A NAME="706"></A><BR><BR>The meekness of the camel is known to be such that if a child takes 
<A NAME="707"></A>hold of its bridle and goes a hundred farsakhs, it will not refuse to follow, 
<A NAME="708"></A>but if a dangerous portion occurs which may occasion death and the child 
<A NAME="709"></A>ignorantly desires to approach it, the camel tears the bridle from his 
<A NAME="710"></A>hand, refusing any longer to obey because compliance in times of calamity 
<A NAME="711"></A>is blamable. It is also said that by complaisance an enemy will not become 
<A NAME="712"></A>a friend but that his greed will only be augmented.
<A NAME="713"></A><BR><BR>To him who is kind to thee, be dust at his feet
<A NAME="714"></A><BR>But if he opposes thee fill his two eyes with dust.
<A NAME="715"></A><BR>Speak not kindly or gently to an ill-humoured fellow

<A NAME="722"></A><BR><BR>An intelligent man will not give a reply
<A NAME="723"></A><BR>Unless he be asked a question.

<A NAME="725"></A><BR>His claim to veracity may be deemed impossible.
<A NAME="726"></A><BR><BR>Maxim 59
<A NAME="727"></A><BR><BR>I had a wound under my robe and a sheikh asked me daily how, but 
<A NAME="728"></A>not where it is, and I learned that he refrained because it is not admissible 
<A NAME="729"></A>to mention every member; and wise men have also said that whoever does 
<A NAME="730"></A>not ponder his question will be grieved by the answer.
<A NAME="731"></A><BR><BR>Until thou knowest thy words to be perfectly 
<A NAME="732"></A>suitable
<A NAME="733"></A><BR>Thou must not open thy mouth in speech.
<A NAME="734"></A><BR>If thou speakest truth and remainest in captivity,
<A NAME="735"></A><BR>It is better than that thy mendacity deliver thee 
<A NAME="736"></A>therefrom.
<A NAME="737"></A><BR><BR>Maxim 60
<A NAME="738"></A><BR><BR>Mendacity resembles a violent blow, the scar of which remains, 
<A NAME="739"></A>though the wound may be healed. Seest thou not how the brothers of Joseph 
<A NAME="740"></A>became noted for falsehood, and no trust in their veracity remained, as 
<A NAME="741"></A>Allah the most high has said: Nay but ye yourselves have contrived the 
<A NAME="742"></A>thing for your own sake.
<A NAME="743"></A><BR><BR>One habitually speaking the truth
<A NAME="744"></A><BR>Is pardoned when he once makes a slip
<A NAME="745"></A><BR>But if he becomes noted for lying,

<A NAME="747"></A><BR><BR>Maxim 61
<A NAME="748"></A><BR><BR>The noblest of beings is evidently man, and the meanest a dog, 
<A NAME="749"></A>but intelligent persons agree that a grateful dog is better than an ungrateful 
<A NAME="750"></A>man.
<A NAME="751"></A><BR><BR>A dog never forgets a morsel received
<A NAME="752"></A><BR>Though thou throwest a stone at him a hundred times.
<A NAME="753"></A><BR>But if thou cherishest a base fellow a lifetime,
<A NAME="754"></A><BR>He will for a trifle suddenly fight with thee.

<A NAME="756"></A><BR><BR>Who panders to his passions will not cultivate accomplishments

<A NAME="768"></A><BR><BR>Sometimes thou art made haughty, and careless by 
<A NAME="769"></A>wealth,
<A NAME="770"></A><BR>Sometimes art in distress from exhaustion and penury.
<A NAME="771"></A><BR>If thy state be such in joy and in distress,

<A NAME="773"></A><BR><BR>Maxim 64
<A NAME="774"></A><BR><BR>The will of the Inscrutable brings down one from the royal throne,

<A NAME="778"></A><BR><BR>Maxim 65
<A NAME="779"></A><BR><BR>When God draws the sword of wrath, prophets and saints draw in 
<A NAME="780"></A>their heads, but if he casts a look of grace, he converts wicked into virtuous

<A NAME="787"></A><BR><BR>Whoever does not betake himself to the path of rectitude in consequence 
<A NAME="788"></A>of the castigations of this world will fall under eternal punishment in

<A NAME="798"></A><BR><BR>Fortunate men are admonished by the adventures and similes of those

<A NAME="842"></A><BR><BR>Maxim 73
<A NAME="843"></A><BR><BR>Who has no mercy upon inferiors will suffer from the tyranny of

<A NAME="886"></A><BR><BR>The padshah is to remove oppressors; the police, murderers; and

<A NAME="889"></A><BR><BR>When thou seest that it must be given what is

<A NAME="900"></A><BR><BR>What can an old prostitute do but vow to become chaste, and an

<A NAME="902"></A><BR><BR>A youth who sits in a corner is a hero in the path of 
<A NAME="903"></A>God
<A NAME="904"></A><BR>Because an old man is unable to rise from his corner.
<A NAME="905"></A><BR><BR>A youth must be strong minded to abstain from

<A NAME="911"></A><BR><BR>A sage was asked: 'Of so many notable, high and fertile trees which 
<A NAME="912"></A>God the most high has created, not one is called free, except the cypress, 
<A NAME="913"></A>which bears no fruit. What is the reason of this?' He replied: 'Every tree 
<A NAME="914"></A>has its appropriate season of fruit, so that it is sometimes flourishing 
<A NAME="915"></A>therewith, and looks sometimes withered by its absence; with the cypress, 
<A NAME="916"></A>however, neither is the case, it being fresh at all times, and this is 
<A NAME="917"></A>the quality of those who are free.'
<A NAME="918"></A><BR><BR>Place not thy heart on what passes away; for the 
<A NAME="919"></A>Tigris
<A NAME="920"></A><BR>Will flow after the Khalifs have passed away in

<A NAME="922"></A><BR>If thou art able, be liberal like the date tree,

<A NAME="933"></A><BR><BR>Conclusion of the Book
<A NAME="934"></A><BR><BR>The book of the Gulistan has been completed, and Allah had been 
<A NAME="935"></A>invoked for aid! By the grace of the Almighty, may his name be honoured, 
<A NAME="936"></A>throughout the work the custom of authors to insert verses from ancient 
<A NAME="937"></A>writers by way of loan, has not been followed.
<A NAME="938"></A><BR><BR>To adorn oneself with one's own rag
<A NAME="939"></A><BR>Is better than to ask for the loan of a robe.
<A NAME="940"></A><BR><BR>Most of the utterances of Sa'di being exhilarant and mixed with 
<A NAME="941"></A>pleasantry, shortsighted persons have on this account lengthened the tongue 
<A NAME="942"></A>of blame, alleging that it is not the part of intelligent men to spend 
<A NAME="943"></A>in vain the kernel of their brain, and to eat without profit the smoke 
<A NAME="944"></A>of the lamp; it is, however, not concealed from enlightened men, who are 
<A NAME="945"></A>able to discern the tendency of words, that pearls of curative admonition 
<A NAME="946"></A>are strung upon the thread of explanation, and that the bitter medicine 
<A NAME="947"></A>of advice is commingled with the honey of wit, in order that the reader's 
<A NAME="948"></A>mind should not be fatigued, and thereby excluded from the benefit of acceptance; 
<A NAME="949"></A>and praise be to the Lord of both worlds.
<A NAME="950"></A><BR><BR>We gave advice in its proper place
<A NAME="951"></A><BR>Spending a lifetime in the task.
<A NAME="952"></A><BR>If it should not touch anyone's ear of desire
<A NAME="953"></A><BR>The messenger told his tale; it is enough.
<A NAME="954"></A><BR><BR>O thou who lookest into it, ask Allah to have 
<A NAME="955"></A>mercy
<A NAME="956"></A><BR>On the author and to pardon the owner of it.
<A NAME="957"></A><BR>Ask for thyself whatever benefit thou mayest desire,
<A NAME="958"></A><BR>And after that pardon for the writer of it.
<A NAME="959"></A><BR>If I had on the day of resurrection an opportunity
<A NAME="960"></A><BR>Near the Compassionate one I should say: 'O Lord,
<A NAME="961"></A><BR>I am the sinner and thou the beneficent master,
<A NAME="962"></A><BR>For all the ill I have done I crave for thy bounty.'
<A NAME="963"></A><BR><BR>Gratitude is due from me to God that this book is ended Before 
<A NAME="964"></A>my life has reached its termination.
