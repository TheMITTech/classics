<A NAME="10"></A><B>On Love and Youth</B>
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="11"></A>Story 1
<A NAME="12"></A><BR><BR>Hasan Maimundi was asked that, as the Sultan Mahmud possesses so 
<A NAME="13"></A>many beautiful slaves, each of whom is a marvel in the world, how it happens 
<A NAME="14"></A>that he manifests towards none of them so much inclination and love as 
<A NAME="15"></A>to Iyaz, although he is not more handsome than the others. He replied: 
<A NAME="16"></A>'Whatever descends into the heart appears good to the 
<A NAME="17"></A>eye.'
<A NAME="18"></A><BR><BR>He whose murid' the sultan is
<A NAME="19"></A><BR>If he does everything bad, it will be good.
<A NAME="20"></A><BR>But he whom the padshah throws away
<A NAME="21"></A><BR>Will not be cared for by anyone in the household.
<A NAME="22"></A><BR><BR>If anyone looks with an unfavourable eye
<A NAME="23"></A><BR>Even the figure of Joseph will indicate ugliness
<A NAME="24"></A><BR>And if he looks with the eye of desire on a demon,
<A NAME="25"></A><BR>He will appear an angel, a cherub in his sigh].
<A NAME="26"></A><BR><BR>Story 2
<A NAME="27"></A><BR><BR>It is said that a gentleman possessed a slave of exquisite beauty, 
<A NAME="28"></A>whom he regarded with love and affection. He nevertheless said to a friend: 
<A NAME="29"></A>'Would that this slave of mine, with all the beauty and good qualities 
<A NAME="30"></A>he possesses, had not a long and uncivil tongue!' He replied: 'Brother, 
<A NAME="31"></A>do not expect service, after professing friendship; because when relations 
<A NAME="32"></A>between lover and beloved come in, the relations between master and servant 
<A NAME="33"></A>are superseded':
<A NAME="34"></A><BR><BR>When a master with a fairy-faced slave
<A NAME="35"></A><BR>Begins to play and to laugh
<A NAME="36"></A><BR>What wonder if the latter coquets like the master
<A NAME="37"></A><BR>And the gentleman bears it like a slave?
<A NAME="38"></A><BR><BR>A slave is to draw water and make bricks.
<A NAME="39"></A><BR>A pampered slave will strike with the fist.
<A NAME="40"></A><BR><BR>Story 3
<A NAME="41"></A><BR><BR>I saw a religious man, who had fallen in love with a fellow to 
<A NAME="42"></A>such a degree that he had neither strength to remain patient nor to bear 
<A NAME="43"></A>the talk of the people but would not relinquish his attachment, despite 
<A NAME="44"></A>of the reproaches he suffered and the grief he bore, 
<A NAME="45"></A>saying:
<A NAME="46"></A><BR><BR>I shall not let go my hold of thy skirt
<A NAME="47"></A><BR>Even if thou strike me with a sharp sword.
<A NAME="48"></A><BR>After thee I have no refuge nor asylum.
<A NAME="49"></A><BR>To thee alone I shall flee if I flee.
<A NAME="50"></A><BR><BR>I once reproached him, asking him what had become of his exquisite 
<A NAME="51"></A>intellect so that it had been overcome by his base proclivity. He meditated 
<A NAME="52"></A>a while and then said:
<A NAME="53"></A><BR><BR>'Wherever love has become sultan
<A NAME="54"></A><BR>Piety's arm has no strength left.
<A NAME="55"></A><BR>How can a helpless fellow live purely
<A NAME="56"></A><BR>Who has sunk up to his neck in impurity?'
<A NAME="57"></A><BR><BR>Story 4
<A NAME="58"></A><BR><BR>One had lost his heart and bidden farewell to his life because 
<A NAME="59"></A>the target which he aimed at was in a dangerous locality, portending destruction 
<A NAME="60"></A>and no chance promising a morsel easily coming to the palate nor a bird 
<A NAME="61"></A>falling into the trap.
<A NAME="62"></A><BR><BR>When thy sweetheart's eye has no regard for 
<A NAME="63"></A>gold
<A NAME="64"></A><BR>Mud and gold are of equal value to thee.
<A NAME="65"></A><BR><BR>I once advised him to abandon his aspiration to a fancy impossible 
<A NAME="66"></A>of realization because many persons are enslaved by the same passion like 
<A NAME="67"></A>himself, the feet of their hearts being in chains. He lamented and 
<A NAME="68"></A>said:
<A NAME="69"></A><BR><BR>'Tell my friends not to give me advice
<A NAME="70"></A><BR>Because my eyes are fixed on her wishes.
<A NAME="71"></A><BR>By the strength of fist and shoulders warriors
<A NAME="72"></A><BR>Slay enemies but sweethearts a friend.'
<A NAME="73"></A><BR><BR>It is against the requirements of love to renounce affection to 
<A NAME="74"></A>our sweethearts for fear of losing our lives.
<A NAME="75"></A><BR><BR>Thou who art a slave to thy selfishness
<A NAME="76"></A><BR>Art mendacious in the game of love.
<A NAME="77"></A><BR>If there be no way to reach the friend
<A NAME="78"></A><BR>Friendship demands to die in pursuit of it.
<A NAME="79"></A><BR><BR>I rise as no other source is left to me
<A NAME="80"></A><BR>Though the foe may smite me with arrow and sword.
<A NAME="81"></A><BR>If chance serves me I shall take hold of her sleeve.
<A NAME="82"></A><BR>Or else I shall go and die on her threshold.
<A NAME="83"></A><BR><BR>His friends, who considered his position, pitied his state, gave 
<A NAME="84"></A>him advice and at last confined him but all to no purpose.
<A NAME="85"></A><BR><BR>Alas, that the physician should prescribe patience,
<A NAME="86"></A><BR>Whereas this greedy lust requires sugar.
<A NAME="87"></A><BR><BR>Hast thou heard that the mistress secretly
<A NAME="88"></A><BR>Told him who had lost his heart:
<A NAME="89"></A><BR>'As long as thou possessest thy own dignity,
<A NAME="90"></A><BR>What will mine amount to in thy eyes?'
<A NAME="91"></A><BR><BR>It is related that the royal prince who was the object of his affection 
<A NAME="92"></A>had been informed to the effect that a good-natured and sweet-spoken youth 
<A NAME="93"></A>was constantly attending on the plain, uttering graceful words; and strange 
<A NAME="94"></A>tales having been heard of him, it appeared that his heart is inflamed 
<A NAME="95"></A>and that he has a touch of insanity in his head. The boy knew that his 
<A NAME="96"></A>heart had become attached to him and that he had raised this dust of calamity. 
<A NAME="97"></A>Accordingly he galloped towards him. When the youth perceived the prince 
<A NAME="98"></A>approaching him, he we and said:
<A NAME="99"></A><BR><BR>'He who has slain me has come back again.
<A NAME="100"></A><BR>It seems his heart burns for him whom he has slain.'
<A NAME="101"></A><BR><BR>Although he accosted the youth graciously, asking him whence he 
<A NAME="102"></A>came and what his occupation was, he was so plunged in the depths of the 
<A NAME="103"></A>ocean of love that he could not breathe:
<A NAME="104"></A><BR><BR>If thou recitest the seven portions of the lesson by 
<A NAME="105"></A>heart,
<A NAME="106"></A><BR>When thou art demented by love thou knowest not the A, B, 
<A NAME="107"></A>C.
<A NAME="108"></A><BR><BR>The prince said: 'Why speakest thou not to me? I also belong to 
<A NAME="109"></A>the circle of dervishes; nay I am even in their service.' In consequence 
<A NAME="110"></A>of the force of the friendly advances of his beloved, he raised his head 
<A NAME="111"></A>from the dashing waves of love and said:
<A NAME="112"></A><BR><BR>'It is a marvel that with thy existence mine 
<A NAME="113"></A>remains
<A NAME="114"></A><BR>That when thou speakest words to me remain.'
<A NAME="115"></A><BR><BR>Saying these words he uttered a shout and surrendered his 
<A NAME="116"></A>life.
<A NAME="117"></A><BR><BR>It would not be strange if he had been slain at his tent 
<A NAME="118"></A>door
<A NAME="119"></A><BR>But it would be strange that if alive he should escape 
<A NAME="120"></A>safe.
<A NAME="121"></A><BR>Story 5
<A NAME="122"></A><BR><BR>A schoolboy was so perfectly beautiful and sweet-voiced that the 
<A NAME="123"></A>teacher, in accordance with human nature, conceived such an affection towards 
<A NAME="124"></A>him that' he often recited the following verses:
<A NAME="125"></A><BR><BR>I am not so little occupied with thee, O heavenly 
<A NAME="126"></A>face,
<A NAME="127"></A><BR>That remembrance of myself occurs to my mind.
<A NAME="128"></A><BR>From thy sight I am unable to withdraw my eyes
<A NAME="129"></A><BR>Although when I am opposite I may see that an arrow 
<A NAME="130"></A>comes.
<A NAME="131"></A><BR><BR>Once the boy said to him: 'As thou strivest to direct my studies, 
<A NAME="132"></A>direct also my behaviour. If thou perceivest anything reprovable in my 
<A NAME="133"></A>conduct, although it may seem approvable to me, inform me thereof that 
<A NAME="134"></A>I may endeavour to change it.' He replied: 'O boy, make that request to 
<A NAME="135"></A>someone else because the eyes with which I look upon thee behold nothing 
<A NAME="136"></A>but virtues.'
<A NAME="137"></A><BR><BR>The ill-wishing eye, be it torn out
<A NAME="138"></A><BR>Sees only defects in his virtue.
<A NAME="139"></A><BR>But if thou possessest one virtue and seventy faults
<A NAME="140"></A><BR>A friend sees nothing except that virtue.
<A NAME="141"></A><BR><BR>Story 6
<A NAME="142"></A><BR><BR>I remember that one night a dear friend of mine entered when I 
<A NAME="143"></A>jumped up in such a heedless way that the lamp was extinguished by my sleeve. 
<A NAME="144"></A>A vision appeared in the night and by its appearance the darkness was 
<A NAME="145"></A>illuminated.
<A NAME="146"></A><BR><BR>I was amazed at my luck exclaiming whence this 
<A NAME="147"></A>felicity?
<A NAME="148"></A><BR><BR>He took a seat and began reproving me saying that when I beheld 
<A NAME="149"></A>him I extinguished the lamp. I said: 'I thought the sun had risen and wits 
<A NAME="150"></A>have said:
<A NAME="151"></A><BR><BR>When an ugly person comes before the lamp
<A NAME="152"></A><BR>Arise to him and pull him into the assembly
<A NAME="153"></A><BR>But if it be a sugar-smiled, sweet-lipped one
<A NAME="154"></A><BR>Pull him by the sleeve and extinguish the lamp.'
<A NAME="155"></A><BR><BR>Story 7
<A NAME="156"></A><BR><BR>One who had for a considerable time not seen his friend asked him 
<A NAME="157"></A>where he had been and said he had been longing. He replied: 'To be longing 
<A NAME="158"></A>is better than to be satisfied.'
<A NAME="159"></A><BR><BR>Thou hast come late, O intoxicated idol,
<A NAME="160"></A><BR>We shall not soon let go thy skirt from the hand.
<A NAME="161"></A><BR>He who sees his sweetheart at long intervals
<A NAME="162"></A><BR>Is after all better off than if he sees too much of 
<A NAME="163"></A>her.
<A NAME="164"></A><BR><BR>When thou comest with friends to visit me
<A NAME="165"></A><BR>Although thou comest in peace thou art attacking.
<A NAME="166"></A><BR><BR>If my sweetheart associates one moment with 
<A NAME="167"></A>strangers
<A NAME="168"></A><BR>It wants but little and I die of jealousy.
<A NAME="169"></A><BR>She said smiling: 'I am the lamp of the assembly, O 
<A NAME="170"></A>Sa'di,
<A NAME="171"></A><BR>What is it to me if a moth kills itself?'
<A NAME="172"></A><BR><BR>Story 8
<A NAME="173"></A><BR><BR>I remember how in former times I and another friend kept company 
<A NAME="174"></A>with each other like two almond kernels in one skin. Suddenly a separation 
<A NAME="175"></A>took place but after a time, when my companion returned, he commenced to 
<A NAME="176"></A>blame me for not having sent him a messenger during it. I replied: 'I thought 
<A NAME="177"></A>it would be a pity that the eyes of a messenger should be brightened by 
<A NAME="178"></A>thy beauty and I deprived thereof.'
<A NAME="179"></A><BR><BR>Tell my old friend not to give me advice with the 
<A NAME="180"></A>tongue
<A NAME="181"></A><BR>Because even a sword will not compel me to repent.
<A NAME="182"></A><BR>I am jealous that anyone should see thee to satiety.
<A NAME="183"></A><BR>Again I say that no one will be satiated.
<A NAME="184"></A><BR><BR>Story 9
<A NAME="185"></A><BR><BR>I knew a learned man who had fallen in love with someone but his 
<A NAME="186"></A>secret having fallen from the veil of concealment into publicity, he endured 
<A NAME="187"></A>abundant persecution and displayed boundless patience. I said once to him 
<A NAME="188"></A>by way of consolation: 'I know thou entertainest no worldly motive nor 
<A NAME="189"></A>inclination for baseness. It is nevertheless unbecoming the dignity of 
<A NAME="190"></A>a scholar to expose himself to suspicions and to bear the persecutions 
<A NAME="191"></A>of mannerless persons.' He replied: 'O friend, take off the hand of reproach 
<A NAME="192"></A>from my skirt because I have often meditated on the opinion which thou 
<A NAME="193"></A>entertainest but have found it easier to bear persecution for his sake 
<A NAME="194"></A>than not to see him; and philosophers have said that it is easier to accustom 
<A NAME="195"></A>the heart to strife, than to turn away the eye from seeing the 
<A NAME="196"></A>beloved.
<A NAME="197"></A><BR><BR>Who has his heart with a heart-ravisher
<A NAME="198"></A><BR>Has his beard in another's hand.
<A NAME="199"></A><BR>A gazelle with a halter on the neck
<A NAME="200"></A><BR>Is not able to walk of its own accord.
<A NAME="201"></A><BR>If he, without whom one cannot abide,
<A NAME="202"></A><BR>Becomes insolent it must be endured.
<A NAME="203"></A><BR>I one day told him to beware of his friend
<A NAME="204"></A><BR>But I often asked pardon for that day.
<A NAME="205"></A><BR>A friend does not abandon a friend.
<A NAME="206"></A><BR>I submit my heart to what he wills.
<A NAME="207"></A><BR>Whether he kindly calls me to himself
<A NAME="208"></A><BR>Or drives me away in anger he knows best.
<A NAME="209"></A><BR><BR>Story 10
<A NAME="210"></A><BR><BR>In the exuberance of youth, as it usually happens and as thou knowest, 
<A NAME="211"></A>I was on the closest terms of intimacy with a sweetheart who had a melodious 
<A NAME="212"></A>voice and a form beautiful like the moon just rising.
<A NAME="213"></A><BR><BR>He, the down of whose cheek drinks the water of 
<A NAME="214"></A>immortality,
<A NAME="215"></A><BR>Whoever looks at his sugar lips eats sweetmeats.
<A NAME="216"></A><BR><BR>I happened to notice something in his behaviour which was contrary 
<A NAME="217"></A>to nature and not approved of by me. Accordingly I gathered up my skirt 
<A NAME="218"></A>from him and, picking up the pieces of the chess-game of friendship, 
<A NAME="219"></A>recited:
<A NAME="220"></A><BR><BR>'Go and do as thou listest.
<A NAME="221"></A><BR>Thou hast not our head; follow thine.'
<A NAME="222"></A><BR><BR>I heard him saying when he went away:
<A NAME="223"></A><BR><BR>'If the bat desires not union with the sun
<A NAME="224"></A><BR>The beauty of the sun will not decrease.'
<A NAME="225"></A><BR><BR>Saying this, he departed and his distress took effect on 
<A NAME="226"></A>me:
<A NAME="227"></A><BR><BR>I lost the time of union and man is ignorant
<A NAME="228"></A><BR>Of the value of delightful life before adversity.
<A NAME="229"></A><BR><BR><B>Return.</B> Slay me. For to die in thy presence
<A NAME="230"></A><BR>Is more sweet than to live after thee.
<A NAME="231"></A><BR><BR>Thanks be to the bounty of God, he returned some time afterwards 
<A NAME="232"></A>but his melodious voice had changed, his Joseph like beauty had faded, 
<A NAME="233"></A>on the apple of his skin dust had settled as upon a quince so that the 
<A NAME="234"></A>splendour of his beauty had departed. He wanted me to embrace him. I complied 
<A NAME="235"></A>and said:
<A NAME="236"></A><BR><BR>'On the day when thou hadst a beauteous incipient 
<A NAME="237"></A>beard
<A NAME="238"></A><BR>Thou drovest him, who desired the sight, from thy 
<A NAME="239"></A>sight.
<A NAME="240"></A><BR>Today thou camest to make peace with him
<A NAME="241"></A><BR>But hast exhibited Fathah and Zammah.
<A NAME="242"></A><BR><BR>His fresh spring is gone and he has become yellow.
<A NAME="243"></A><BR>Bring not the kettle because our fire is extinguished.
<A NAME="244"></A><BR>How long wilt thou strut about, showing arrogance,
<A NAME="245"></A><BR>Imagining felicity which has elapsed?
<A NAME="246"></A><BR>Go to him who will purchase thee.
<A NAME="247"></A><BR>Coquet with him who asks for thee.
<A NAME="248"></A><BR><BR>They said: "Verdure in the garden is pleasing."
<A NAME="249"></A><BR>He knows it who utters these words.
<A NAME="250"></A><BR>Namely, heartfelt affection for that green line
<A NAME="251"></A><BR>Fascinates the hearts of lovers more and more.
<A NAME="252"></A><BR>Thy garden is a bed of leeks.
<A NAME="253"></A><BR>The more thou weedest it the more they grow.
<A NAME="254"></A><BR><BR>Whether thou pluckest out thy beard or not
<A NAME="255"></A><BR>This happiness of youthful days must end.
<A NAME="256"></A><BR>Had I the power of life as thou of the beard
<A NAME="257"></A><BR>I would not let it end till resurrection-day.
<A NAME="258"></A><BR><BR>I asked and said: What has befallen the beauty of thy 
<A NAME="259"></A>face
<A NAME="260"></A><BR>That ants are crawling round the moon?
<A NAME="261"></A><BR>He replied, smiling: "I know not what is the matter
<A NAME="262"></A><BR>with my face.
<A NAME="263"></A><BR>Perhaps it wears black as mourning for my beauty."'
<A NAME="264"></A><BR><BR>Story 11
<A NAME="265"></A><BR><BR>I asked one of the people of Baghdad what he thought of beardless 
<A NAME="266"></A>youths. He replied: 'There is no good in them for when one of them is yet 
<A NAME="267"></A>delicate and wanted he is insolent; but when he becomes rough and is not 
<A NAME="268"></A>wanted he is affable.'
<A NAME="269"></A><BR><BR>When a beardless youth is beautiful and sweet

<A NAME="274"></A><BR><BR>One of the ullemma had been asked that, supposing one sits with 
<A NAME="275"></A>a moon-faced beauty in a private apartment, the doors being closed, companions 
<A NAME="276"></A>asleep, passion inflamed, and lust raging, as the Arab says, the date is 
<A NAME="277"></A>ripe and its guardian not forbidding, whether he thought the power of abstinence 
<A NAME="278"></A>would cause the man to remain in safety. He replied: 'If he remains in 
<A NAME="279"></A>safety from the moon-faced one, he will not remain safe from evil 
<A NAME="280"></A>speakers.'
<A NAME="281"></A><BR><BR>If a man escapes from his own bad lust
<A NAME="282"></A><BR>He will not escape from the bad suspicions of accusers.

<A NAME="286"></A><BR><BR>A parrot, having been imprisoned in a cage with a crow, was vexed 
<A NAME="287"></A>by the sight and said: 'What a loathsome aspect is this! What an odious 
<A NAME="288"></A>figure! What cursed object with rude habits! 0 crow of separation, would 
<A NAME="289"></A>that the distance of the east from the west were between

<A NAME="293"></A><BR>An ill-omened one like thyself is fit to keep thee 
<A NAME="294"></A>company
<A NAME="295"></A><BR>But where in the world is one like thee?
<A NAME="296"></A><BR><BR>More strange still, the crow was similarly distressed by the proximity 
<A NAME="297"></A>of the parrot and, having become disgusted, was shouting 'La haul', and 
<A NAME="298"></A>lamenting the vicissitudes of time. He rubbed the claws of sorrow against 
<A NAME="299"></A>each other and said: 'What ill-luck is this? What base destiny and chameleonlike 
<A NAME="300"></A>times? It was befitting my dignity to strut about on a garden-wall in the 
<A NAME="301"></A>society of another crow.
<A NAME="302"></A><BR><BR>'It is sufficient imprisonment for a devote
<A NAME="303"></A><BR>To be in the same stable with profligates.
<A NAME="304"></A><BR><BR>'What sin have I committed that I have already in this life, as 
<A NAME="305"></A>a punishment for it, fallen into the bonds of this calamity in company 
<A NAME="306"></A>with such a conceited, uncongenial and heedless fool?'

<A NAME="315"></A><BR>When one of them, a Balkhi beauty, said:

<A NAME="322"></A><BR><BR>Story 14
<A NAME="323"></A><BR><BR>I had a companion with whom I had travelled for years and eaten 
<A NAME="324"></A>salt. Boundless intimacy subsisted between us till at last he suffered 
<A NAME="325"></A>my mind to be grieved for the sake of some paltry gain and our friendship 
<A NAME="326"></A>closed. Despite of an this, however, mutual attachment of heart still subsisted 
<A NAME="327"></A>between us because I heard him one day reciting in an assembly the following 
<A NAME="328"></A>two distichs of my composition:
<A NAME="329"></A><BR><BR>When my sweetheart enters sweetly smiling
<A NAME="330"></A><BR>She adds more salt to my bleeding wound.
<A NAME="331"></A><BR>How would it be if the tip of her curls fell into my 
<A NAME="332"></A>hand
<A NAME="333"></A><BR>Like the sleeve of the bountiful into the hands of 
<A NAME="334"></A>dervishes?
<A NAME="335"></A><BR><BR>Some friends bore witness not so much to the gracefulness of these 
<A NAME="336"></A>verses as to the beauty of my conduct which they approved; and among the 
<A NAME="337"></A>rest, the said friend likewise added his share of praise, regretting the 
<A NAME="338"></A>loss of our former companionship and confessing his fault so that his affection 
<A NAME="339"></A>became known. Accordingly I sent the following distichs and made 
<A NAME="340"></A>peace:
<A NAME="341"></A><BR><BR>Was not there a covenant of friendship between 
<A NAME="342"></A>us?
<A NAME="343"></A><BR>Thou hast been cruel and not loving.
<A NAME="344"></A><BR>I once tied my heart to thee, disregarding the world.
<A NAME="345"></A><BR>Not knowing thou wouldst turn back so soon.
<A NAME="346"></A><BR>If thou yet desirest conciliation, return
<A NAME="347"></A><BR>Because thou wilt be more beloved than before.

<A NAME="349"></A><BR><BR>The beautiful wife of a man died but her mother, a decrepit old

<A NAME="352"></A>visit of condolence and one of them asked him how he bore the loss of his 
<A NAME="353"></A>beloved. He replied: 'It is not as painful not to see my wife as to see

<A NAME="362"></A><BR><BR>Story 16
<A NAME="363"></A><BR><BR>I remember having in the days of my youth passed through a street, 
<A NAME="364"></A>intending to see a moon-faced beauty. It was in Temuz, whose heat dried 
<A NAME="365"></A>up the saliva in the mouth and whose simum boiled the marrow in my bones. 
<A NAME="366"></A>My weak human nature being unable to endure the scorching sun, I took refuge 
<A NAME="367"></A>in the shadow of a wall, wishing someone might relieve me from the summer 
<A NAME="368"></A>heat and quench my fire with some water; and lo, all of a sudden, from 
<A NAME="369"></A>the darkness of the porch of a house a light shone forth, namely a beauty, 
<A NAME="370"></A>the grace of which the tongue of eloquence is unable to describe. She came 
<A NAME="371"></A>out like the rising dawn after an obscure night or the water of immortality 
<A NAME="372"></A>gushing from a dark cavern, carrying in her hand a bowl of snow-water, 
<A NAME="373"></A>into which sugar had been poured and essence of roses mixed. I knew not 
<A NAME="374"></A>whether she had perfumed it with rose-water or whether a few drops from 
<A NAME="375"></A>her rosy face had fallen into it. In short, I took the beverage from her 
<A NAME="376"></A>beautiful hands, drank it and began to live again.
<A NAME="377"></A><BR><BR>The thirst of my heart cannot be quenched
<A NAME="378"></A><BR>By sipping limpid water even if I drink oceans of 
<A NAME="379"></A>it.

<A NAME="384"></A><BR><BR>Story 17
<A NAME="385"></A><BR><BR>In the year when Muhammad Khovarezm Shah concluded peace with the 
<A NAME="386"></A>king of Khata to suit his own purpose, I entered the cathedral mosque of 
<A NAME="387"></A>Kashgar and saw an extremely handsome, graceful boy as described in the 
<A NAME="388"></A>simile:
<A NAME="389"></A><BR><BR>Thy master has taught thee to coquet and to ravish 
<A NAME="390"></A>hearts,
<A NAME="391"></A><BR>Instructed thee to oppose, to dally, to blame and to be 
<A NAME="392"></A>severe.
<A NAME="393"></A><BR>A person of such figure, temper, stature and gait
<A NAME="394"></A><BR>I have not seen; perhaps he learnt these tricks from a 
<A NAME="395"></A>fairy.
<A NAME="396"></A><BR><BR>He was holding in his hand the introduction to Zamaksharni's Arabic 
<A NAME="397"></A>syntax and reciting: Zaid struck Amru and was the injurer of Amru. I said: 
<A NAME="398"></A>'Boy! Khovarezm and Khata have concluded peace, and the quarrel between 
<A NAME="399"></A>Zaid and Amru still subsists!' He smiled and asked for my birthplace. I 
<A NAME="400"></A>replied: 'The soil of Shiraz.' He continued: 'What rememberest thou of 
<A NAME="401"></A>the compositions of Sa'di?' I recited:
<A NAME="402"></A><BR><BR>'I am tired by a nahvi who makes a furious attack
<A NAME="403"></A><BR>Upon me, like Zaid in his opposition to Amru.
<A NAME="404"></A><BR>When Zaid submits he does not raise his head
<A NAME="405"></A><BR>And how can elevation subsist when submission is the 
<A NAME="406"></A>regent?
<A NAME="407"></A><BR><BR>He considered awhile and then said: 'Most of his poetry current 
<A NAME="408"></A>in this country is in the Persian language. If thou wilt recite some, it 
<A NAME="409"></A>will be more easily understood.' Then I said:
<A NAME="410"></A><BR><BR>'When thy nature has enticed thee with syntax
<A NAME="411"></A><BR>It blotted out the form of intellect from our heart.
<A NAME="412"></A><BR>Alas, the hearts of lovers are captive in thy snare.
<A NAME="413"></A><BR>We are occupied with thee but thou with Amru and 
<A NAME="414"></A>Zaid.'
<A NAME="415"></A><BR><BR>The next morning, when I was about to depart, some people told 
<A NAME="416"></A>him that I was Sa'di, whereon he came running to me and politely expressed 
<A NAME="417"></A>his regret that I had not revealed my identity before so that he might 
<A NAME="418"></A>have girded his loins to serve me in token of the gratitude due to the 
<A NAME="419"></A>presence of a great man.
<A NAME="420"></A><BR><BR>In spite of thy presence no voice came to say: I am 
<A NAME="421"></A>he.
<A NAME="422"></A><BR><BR>He also said: 'What would it be if thou wert to spend in this country 
<A NAME="423"></A>some days in repose that we might derive advantage by serving thee?' I 
<A NAME="424"></A>replied: 'I cannot on account of the following adventure which occurred 
<A NAME="425"></A>to me:
<A NAME="426"></A><BR><BR>I beheld an illustrious man in a mountain region
<A NAME="427"></A><BR>Who had contentedly retired from the world into a 
<A NAME="428"></A>cave.
<A NAME="429"></A><BR>Why, said I, comest thou not into the city
<A NAME="430"></A><BR>For once to relax the bonds of thy heart?
<A NAME="431"></A><BR>He replied: 'Fairy-faced maidens are there.
<A NAME="432"></A><BR>When clay is plentiful, elephants will stumble.'
<A NAME="433"></A><BR><BR>This I said. Then we kissed each other's heads and faces and took 
<A NAME="434"></A>leave of each other.
<A NAME="435"></A><BR><BR>What profits it to kiss a friend's face
<A NAME="436"></A><BR>And at the same time to take leave of him?
<A NAME="437"></A><BR>Thou wouldst say that he who parts from friends is an 
<A NAME="438"></A>apple.
<A NAME="439"></A><BR>One half of his face is red and the other yellow.
<A NAME="440"></A><BR><BR>If I die not of grief on the day of separation
<A NAME="441"></A><BR>Reckon me not faithful in friendship.
<A NAME="442"></A><BR><BR>Story 18
<A NAME="443"></A><BR><BR>A man in patched garments' accompanied us in a caravan to the Hejaz 
<A NAME="444"></A>and one of the Arab amirs presented him with a hundred dinars to spend 
<A NAME="445"></A>upon his family but robbers of the Kufatcha tribe suddenly fell upon the 
<A NAME="446"></A>caravan and robbed it clean of everything. The merchants began to wail 
<A NAME="447"></A>and to cry, uttering vain shouts and lamentations.
<A NAME="448"></A><BR><BR>Whether thou implorest or complainest
<A NAME="449"></A><BR>The robber will not return the gold again.
<A NAME="450"></A><BR><BR>The dervish alone had not lost his equanimity and showed no change. 
<A NAME="451"></A>I asked: 'Perhaps they have not taken thy money?' He replied: 'Yes, they 
<A NAME="452"></A>have but I was not so much accustomed to that money that separation therefrom 
<A NAME="453"></A>could grieve my heart':
<A NAME="454"></A><BR><BR>The heart must not be tied to any thing or person
<A NAME="455"></A><BR>Because to take off the heart is a difficult affair.
<A NAME="456"></A><BR><BR>I replied: 'What thou hast said resembles my case because, when 
<A NAME="457"></A>I was young, my intimacy with a young man and my friendship for him were 
<A NAME="458"></A>such that his beauty was the Qiblah of my eye and the chief joy of my life 
<A NAME="459"></A>union with him':
<A NAME="460"></A><BR><BR>Perhaps an angel in heaven but no mortal
<A NAME="461"></A><BR>Can be on earth equal in beauty of form to him.
<A NAME="462"></A><BR>I swear by the amity, after which companionship is 
<A NAME="463"></A>illicit,
<A NAME="464"></A><BR>No human sperm will ever become a man like him.
<A NAME="465"></A><BR><BR>All of a sudden the foot of his life sank into the mire of non-existence. 
<A NAME="466"></A>The smoke of separation arose from his family. I kept him company on his 
<A NAME="467"></A>grave for many days and one of my compositions on his loss is as 
<A NAME="468"></A>follows:
<A NAME="469"></A><BR><BR>Would that on the day when the thorn of fate entered thy 
<A NAME="470"></A>foot
<A NAME="471"></A><BR>The hand of heaven had struck a sword on my head;
<A NAME="472"></A><BR>So that this day my eye could not see the world without 
<A NAME="473"></A>thee.
<A NAME="474"></A><BR>Here I am on thy grave, would that it were over my 
<A NAME="475"></A>head.
<A NAME="476"></A><BR><BR>He who could take neither rest nor sleep
<A NAME="477"></A><BR>Before he had first scattered roses and narcissi.
<A NAME="478"></A><BR>The turns of heaven have strewn the roses of his 
<A NAME="479"></A>face.
<A NAME="480"></A><BR>Thorns and brambles are growing on his tomb.
<A NAME="481"></A><BR><BR>After separation from him I resolved and firmly determined to fold 
<A NAME="482"></A>up the carpet of pleasure during the rest of my life and to retire from 
<A NAME="483"></A>mixing in society:
<A NAME="484"></A><BR><BR>Last night I strutted about like a peacock in the garden of 
<A NAME="485"></A>union
<A NAME="486"></A><BR>But today, through separation from my friend, I twist my head 
<A NAME="487"></A>like
<A NAME="488"></A><BR>a snake.
<A NAME="489"></A><BR>The profit of the sea would be good if there were no fear of 
<A NAME="490"></A>waves.
<A NAME="491"></A><BR>The company of the rose would be sweet if there were no pain 
<A NAME="492"></A>from
<A NAME="493"></A><BR>thorns.
<A NAME="494"></A><BR><BR>Story 19
<A NAME="495"></A><BR><BR>A king of the Arabs, having been informed of the relations subsisting 
<A NAME="496"></A>between Laila and Mejnun, with an account of the latter's insanity, to 
<A NAME="497"></A>the effect that he had in spite of his great accomplishments and eloquence, 
<A NAME="498"></A>chosen to roam about in the desert and to let go the reins of self-control 
<A NAME="499"></A>from his hands; he ordered him to be brought to his presence, and this 
<A NAME="500"></A>having been done, he began to reprove him and to ask him what defect he 
<A NAME="501"></A>had discovered in the nobility of the human soul that he adopted the habits 
<A NAME="502"></A>of beasts and abandoned the society of mankind. Mejnun 
<A NAME="503"></A>replied:
<A NAME="504"></A><BR><BR>'Many friends have blamed me for loving her.
<A NAME="505"></A><BR>Will they not see her one day and understand my 
<A NAME="506"></A>excuse?'
<A NAME="507"></A><BR><BR>Would that those who are reproving me
<A NAME="508"></A><BR>Could see thy face, O ravisher of hearts,
<A NAME="509"></A><BR>That instead of a lemon in thy presence
<A NAME="510"></A><BR>They might heedlessly cut their hands.
<A NAME="511"></A><BR><BR>That the truth may bear witness to the assertion: This is he for 
<A NAME="512"></A>whose sake ye blamed me.
<A NAME="513"></A><BR><BR>The king expressed a wish to see the beauty of Laila in order to 
<A NAME="514"></A>ascertain the cause of so much distress. Accordingly he ordered her to 
<A NAME="515"></A>be searched for. The encampments of various Arab families having been visited, 
<A NAME="516"></A>she was found, conveyed to the king and led into the courtyard of the palace. 
<A NAME="517"></A>The king looked at her outward form for some time and she appeared despicable 
<A NAME="518"></A>in his sight because the meanest handmaids of his harem excelled her in 
<A NAME="519"></A>beauty and attractions. Mejnun, who shrewdly understood the thoughts of 
<A NAME="520"></A>the king, said: 'It would have been necessary to look from the window of 
<A NAME="521"></A>Mejnun's eye at the beauty of Laila when the mystery of her aspect would 
<A NAME="522"></A>have been revealed to thee.'
<A NAME="523"></A><BR><BR>If the record of the glade which entered my 
<A NAME="524"></A>ears
<A NAME="525"></A><BR>Had been heard by the leaves of the glade they would
<A NAME="526"></A><BR>have lamented with me.
<A NAME="527"></A><BR>O company of friends, say to him who is unconcerned
<A NAME="528"></A><BR>'Would that thou knewest what is in a pining heart
<A NAME="529"></A><BR><BR>Who are healthy have no pain from wounds.
<A NAME="530"></A><BR>I shall tell my grief to no one but a sympathizer.
<A NAME="531"></A><BR>It is useless to speak of bees to one
<A NAME="532"></A><BR>Who never in his life felt their sting.
<A NAME="533"></A><BR>As long as thy state is not like mine
<A NAME="534"></A><BR>My state will be but an idle tale to thee.
<A NAME="535"></A><BR><BR>Story 20
<A NAME="536"></A><BR><BR>It is related that the qazi of Hamdan, having conceived affection 
<A NAME="537"></A>towards a farrier-boy and the horseshoe of his heart being on fire, he 
<A NAME="538"></A>sought for some time to meet him, roaming about and seeking for opportunities, 
<A NAME="539"></A>according to the saying of chroniclers:
<A NAME="540"></A><BR><BR>That straight tall cypress my eyes beheld
<A NAME="541"></A><BR>It robbed me of my heart and threw me down.
<A NAME="542"></A><BR>Those wanton eyes have taken my heart with a lasso.
<A NAME="543"></A><BR>If thou desirest to preserve thy heart shut thy 
<A NAME="544"></A>eyes.
<A NAME="545"></A><BR><BR>I was informed that the boy, who had heard something of the qazi's 
<A NAME="546"></A>passion, happening to meet him in a thoroughfare, manifested immense wrath, 
<A NAME="547"></A>assailed the qazi with disrespectful and insulting words, snatched up a 
<A NAME="548"></A>stone and left no injury untried. The qazi said to an ullemma of repute 
<A NAME="549"></A>who happened to be of the same opinion with him:
<A NAME="550"></A><BR><BR>'Look at that sweetheart and his getting angry,
<A NAME="551"></A><BR>And that bitter knot of his sweet eyebrow.'
<A NAME="552"></A><BR><BR>The Arab says: 'A slap from a lover is a raisin.
<A NAME="553"></A><BR><BR>A blow from the hand on the mouth
<A NAME="554"></A><BR>Is sweeter than eating bread with one's own hand.
<A NAME="555"></A><BR><BR>In the same way the boy's impudence might be indicating kindness 
<A NAME="556"></A>as padshahs utter hard words whilst they secretly wish for 
<A NAME="557"></A>peace:
<A NAME="558"></A><BR><BR>Grapes yet unripe are sour.
<A NAME="559"></A><BR>Wait two or three days, they will become sweet.
<A NAME="560"></A><BR><BR>After saying these words he returned to his court of justice, where 
<A NAME="561"></A>some respectable men connected with him kissed the ground of service and 
<A NAME="562"></A>said: 'With thy permission we shall, doing obeisance, speak some words 
<A NAME="563"></A>to thee although they may be contrary to politeness because illustrious 
<A NAME="564"></A>men have said:
<A NAME="565"></A><BR><BR>It is not permissible to argue on every topic.
<A NAME="566"></A><BR>To find fault with great men is wrong.
<A NAME="567"></A><BR><BR>'But as in consequence of favours conferred by thy lordship in 
<A NAME="568"></A>former times upon thy servants it would be a kind of treachery to withhold 
<A NAME="569"></A>the opinion they entertain, they inform thee that the proper way is not 
<A NAME="570"></A>to yield to thy inclinations concerning this boy but to fold up the carpet 
<A NAME="571"></A>of lascivious desires because thy dignity as qazi is high and must not 
<A NAME="572"></A>be polluted by a base crime. The companion thou hast seen is this, and 
<A NAME="573"></A>our words thou hast heard are these:
<A NAME="574"></A><BR><BR>One who has done many disreputable things
<A NAME="575"></A><BR>Cares nothing for the reputation of anyone.
<A NAME="576"></A><BR>Many a good name of fifty years
<A NAME="577"></A><BR>Was trodden under foot by one bad name."
<A NAME="578"></A><BR><BR>The qazi approved of the unanimous advice of his friends and appreciated 
<A NAME="579"></A>their good opinion as well as their steadfast fidelity, saying that the 
<A NAME="580"></A>view taken by his beloved friends on the arrangement of his case was perfectly 
<A NAME="581"></A>right and their arguments admitting of no contradiction. 
<A NAME="582"></A>Nevertheless:
<A NAME="583"></A><BR><BR>Although love ceases in consequence of reproval
<A NAME="584"></A><BR>I heard that just men sometimes concoct falsehoods.
<A NAME="585"></A><BR><BR>Blame me as much as thou listest
<A NAME="586"></A><BR>Because blackness cannot be washed off from a negro.
<A NAME="587"></A><BR><BR>Nothing can blot out my remembrance of thee.
<A NAME="588"></A><BR>I am a snake with broken head and cannot turn.
<A NAME="589"></A><BR><BR>These words he said and sent some persons to make inquiries about 
<A NAME="590"></A>him, spending boundless money because it is said that whoever has gold 
<A NAME="591"></A>in his hand possesses strength of arm and he who has no worldly goods has 
<A NAME="592"></A>no friends in the whole world:
<A NAME="593"></A><BR><BR>Whoever has seen gold droops his head,
<A NAME="594"></A><BR>Although he may be hard to bend like iron-backed 
<A NAME="595"></A>scales.
<A NAME="596"></A><BR><BR>In short, one night he obtained privacy but during that night the 
<A NAME="597"></A>police obtained information that the qazi is spending the whole of it with 
<A NAME="598"></A>wine in his hand and a sweetheart on his bosom, enjoying himself, not sleeping, 
<A NAME="599"></A>and singing:
<A NAME="600"></A><BR><BR>Has this cock perhaps not crowed at the proper time this 
<A NAME="601"></A>night
<A NAME="602"></A><BR>And have the lovers not had their fill of embrace, and 
<A NAME="603"></A>kiss
<A NAME="604"></A><BR>Whilst alas for only a moment the eye of confusion is 
<A NAME="605"></A>asleep?
<A NAME="606"></A><BR>Remain awake that life may not elapse in vain
<A NAME="607"></A><BR>Till thou hearest the morning call from the Friday-mosque
<A NAME="608"></A><BR>Or the noise of kettle-drums on Atabek's palace-gate.
<A NAME="609"></A><BR>Lips against lips like the cock's eye
<A NAME="610"></A><BR>Are not to part at the crowing of a silly cock.
<A NAME="611"></A><BR><BR>Whilst the qazi was in this state one of his dependants entered 
<A NAME="612"></A>and said: 'Arise and run as far as thy feet will carry thee because the 
<A NAME="613"></A>envious have not only obtained a handle for vexation but have spoken the 
<A NAME="614"></A>truth. We may, whilst the fire of confusion is yet burning low, perchance 
<A NAME="615"></A>extinguish it with the water of stratagem but when it blazes up high it 
<A NAME="616"></A>may destroy a world.' The qazi, however, replied:
<A NAME="617"></A><BR><BR>'When the lion has his claws on the game
<A NAME="618"></A><BR>What boots it if a jackal makes his appearance?
<A NAME="619"></A><BR>Keep thy face on the face of the friend and leave
<A NAME="620"></A><BR>The foe to chew the back of his own hand in rage.'
<A NAME="621"></A><BR><BR>The same night information was also brought to the king that in 
<A NAME="622"></A>his realm such a wickedness had been perpetrated and he was asked what 
<A NAME="623"></A>he thought of it. He replied: 'I know that he is one of the most learned 
<A NAME="624"></A>men, and I account him to be the paragon of our age. As it is possible 
<A NAME="625"></A>that enemies have devised a plot against him, I give no credit to this 
<A NAME="626"></A>accusation unless I obtain ocular evidence because philosophers have 
<A NAME="627"></A>said:
<A NAME="628"></A><BR><BR>He who grasps the sword in haste
<A NAME="629"></A><BR>Will repenting carry the back of his hand to his teeth and bite 
<A NAME="630"></A>it.'
<A NAME="631"></A><BR><BR>I heard that at dawn the king with some of his courtiers arrived 
<A NAME="632"></A>at the pillow of the qazi, saw a lamp standing, the sweetheart sitting, 
<A NAME="633"></A>the wine spilled, the goblet broken and the qazi plunged in the sleep of 
<A NAME="634"></A>drunkenness, unaware of the realm of existence. The king awakened him gently 
<A NAME="635"></A>and said: 'Get up for the sun has risen.' The qazi, who perceived the state 
<A NAME="636"></A>of affairs, asked: 'From what direction?' The sultan was astonished and 
<A NAME="637"></A>replied: 'From the east as usual.' The qazi exclaimed: 'Praise be to Allah! 
<A NAME="638"></A>The door of repentance is yet open because according to tradition the gate 
<A NAME="639"></A>Of repentance will not be locked against worshippers till the sun rises 
<A NAME="640"></A>in its setting place.'
<A NAME="641"></A><BR><BR>These two things impelled me to sin:
<A NAME="642"></A><BR>My ill-luck and my imperfect understanding.
<A NAME="643"></A><BR>If thou givest me punishment I deserve it
<A NAME="644"></A><BR>And if thou forgivest pardon is better than revenge.
<A NAME="645"></A><BR><BR>The king replied: 'As thou knowest that thou must suffer capital 
<A NAME="646"></A>punishment, it is of no use to repent. But their faith availed them not 
<A NAME="647"></A>after they had beholden our vengeance.
<A NAME="648"></A><BR><BR>'What is the use to promise to forego thieving
<A NAME="649"></A><BR>When a lasso cannot be thrown up to the palace?
<A NAME="650"></A><BR>Say to the tall man: "Do not pluck the fruit",
<A NAME="651"></A><BR>For he who is short cannot reach the branch.
<A NAME="652"></A><BR><BR>'For thee, who hast committed such wickedness, there is no way 
<A NAME="653"></A>of escape.' After the king had uttered these words, the men appointed for 
<A NAME="654"></A>the execution took hold of him, whereon he said: 'I have one word more 
<A NAME="655"></A>to speak in the service of the sultan.' The king, who heard him, asked: 
<A NAME="656"></A>'What is it?' And he recited:
<A NAME="657"></A><BR><BR>'Thou who shakest the sleeve of displeasure upon 
<A NAME="658"></A>me
<A NAME="659"></A><BR>Expect not that I shall withdraw my hand from thy 
<A NAME="660"></A>skirt.
<A NAME="661"></A><BR>If escape be impossible from this crime which I 
<A NAME="662"></A>committed
<A NAME="663"></A><BR>I trust to the clemency which thou possessest.'
<A NAME="664"></A><BR><BR>The king replied: 'Thou hast adduced this wonderful sally and hast 
<A NAME="665"></A>enounced a strange maxim but it is impossible according to reason and contrary 
<A NAME="666"></A>to usage that thy accomplishments and eloquence should this day save thee 
<A NAME="667"></A>from the punishment which I have decreed; and I consider it proper to throw 
<A NAME="668"></A>thee headlong from the castle that others may take an example.' He continued: 
<A NAME="669"></A>'O lord of the world, I have been nourished by the bounty of this dynasty, 
<A NAME="670"></A>and this crime was not committed only by me in the world. Throw another 
<A NAME="671"></A>man headlong that I may take the example.' The king burst out laughing, 
<A NAME="672"></A>pardoned his crime and said to his dependents who desired the qazi to be 
<A NAME="673"></A>slain:
<A NAME="674"></A><BR><BR>'Everyone of you who are bearers of your own 
<A NAME="675"></A>faults
<A NAME="676"></A><BR>Ought not to blame others for their defects.'
<A NAME="677"></A><BR><BR>Story 21
<A NAME="678"></A><BR><BR>A virtuous and beauteous youth
<A NAME="679"></A><BR>Was pledged to a chaste maiden.
<A NAME="680"></A><BR>I read that in the great sea
<A NAME="681"></A><BR>They fell into a vortex together.
<A NAME="682"></A><BR>When a sailor came to take his hand,
<A NAME="683"></A><BR>Lest he might die in that condition,
<A NAME="684"></A><BR>He said in anguish from the waves:
<A NAME="685"></A><BR>'Leave me. Take the hand of my love.'
<A NAME="686"></A><BR>Whilst saying this, he despaired of life.
<A NAME="687"></A><BR>In his agony he was heard to exclaim:
<A NAME="688"></A><BR>'Learn not the tale of love from the wretch
<A NAME="689"></A><BR>Who forgets his beloved in distress.'
<A NAME="690"></A><BR>Thus the lives of the lovers terminated.
<A NAME="691"></A><BR>Learn from what has occurred that thou mayest know
<A NAME="692"></A><BR>Because Sa'di is of the ways and means of love affairs
<A NAME="693"></A><BR>Well aware in the Arabian city of Baghdad.
<A NAME="694"></A><BR>Tie thy heart to the heart-charmer thou possessest
<A NAME="695"></A><BR>And shut thy eye to all the rest of the world.
<A NAME="696"></A><BR>If Mejnun and Laila were to come to life again
<A NAME="697"></A><BR>They might indite a tale of love on this occurrence.
