<A NAME="10"></A><B>The Manners of Kings</B>
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="11"></A>Story 1
<A NAME="12"></A><BR><BR>I heard a padshah giving orders to kill a prisoner. The helpless 
<A NAME="13"></A>fellow began to insult the king on that occasion of despair, with the tongue 
<A NAME="14"></A>he had, and to use foul expressions according to the 
<A NAME="15"></A>saying:
<A NAME="16"></A><BR><BR>Who washes his hands of life
<A NAME="17"></A><BR>Says whatever he has in his heart.
<A NAME="18"></A><BR><BR>When a man is in despair his tongue becomes long and he is like 
<A NAME="19"></A>a vanquished cat assailing a dog.
<A NAME="20"></A><BR><BR>In time of need, when flight is no more possible,
<A NAME="21"></A><BR>The hand grasps the point of the sharp sword.
<A NAME="22"></A><BR><BR>When the king asked what he was saying, a good-natured vezier replied: 
<A NAME="23"></A>'My lord, he says: Those who bridle their anger and forgive men; for Allah 
<A NAME="24"></A>loveth the beneficent.'
<A NAME="25"></A><BR><BR>The king, moved with pity, forbore taking his life but another 
<A NAME="26"></A>vezier, the antagonist of the former, said: 'Men of our rank ought to speak 
<A NAME="27"></A>nothing but the truth in the presence of padshahs. This fellow has insulted 
<A NAME="28"></A>the king and spoken unbecomingly.' The king, being displeased with these 
<A NAME="29"></A>words, said: 'That lie was more acceptable to me than this truth thou hast 
<A NAME="30"></A>uttered because the former proceeded from a conciliatory disposition and 
<A NAME="31"></A>the latter from malignity; and wise men have said: "A falsehood resulting 
<A NAME="32"></A>in conciliation is better than a truth producing trouble."'
<A NAME="33"></A><BR><BR>He whom the shah follows in what he says,
<A NAME="34"></A><BR>It is a pity if he speaks anything but what is good.
<A NAME="35"></A><BR><BR>The following inscription was upon the portico of the hall of 
<A NAME="36"></A>Feridun:
<A NAME="37"></A><BR><BR>O brother, the world remains with no one.
<A NAME="38"></A><BR>Bind the heart to the Creator, it is enough.
<A NAME="39"></A><BR>Rely not upon possessions and this world
<A NAME="40"></A><BR>Because it has cherished many like thee and slain 
<A NAME="41"></A>them.
<A NAME="42"></A><BR>When the pure soul is about to depart,
<A NAME="43"></A><BR>What boots it if one dies on a throne or on the 
<A NAME="44"></A>ground?
<A NAME="45"></A><BR><BR>Story 2
<A NAME="46"></A><BR><BR>One of the kings of Khorasan had a vision in a dream of Sultan 
<A NAME="47"></A>Mahmud, one hundred years after his death. His whole person appeared to 
<A NAME="48"></A>have been dissolved and turned to dust, except his eyes, which were revolving 
<A NAME="49"></A>in their orbits and looking about. All the sages were unable to give an 
<A NAME="50"></A>interpretation, except a dervish who made his salutation and said: 'He 
<A NAME="51"></A>is still looking amazed how his kingdom belongs to others.'
<A NAME="52"></A><BR><BR>Many famous men have been buried under ground
<A NAME="53"></A><BR>Of whose existence on earth not a trace has remained
<A NAME="54"></A><BR>And that old corpse which had been surrendered to the 
<A NAME="55"></A>earth
<A NAME="56"></A><BR>Was so consumed by the soil that not a bone remains.
<A NAME="57"></A><BR>The glorious name of Nushirvan survives in good 
<A NAME="58"></A>repute
<A NAME="59"></A><BR>Although much time elapsed since he passed away.
<A NAME="60"></A><BR>Do good, O man, and consider life as a good fortune,
<A NAME="61"></A><BR>The more so, as when a shout is raised, a man exists no 
<A NAME="62"></A>more.
<A NAME="63"></A><BR><BR>Story 3
<A NAME="64"></A><BR><BR>I have heard that a royal prince of short stature and mean presence, 
<A NAME="65"></A>whose brothers were tall and good-looking, once saw his father glancing 
<A NAME="66"></A>on him with aversion and contempt but he had the shrewdness and penetration 
<A NAME="67"></A>to guess the meaning and said: 'O father, a puny intelligent fellow is 
<A NAME="68"></A>better than a tall ignorant man, neither is everything bigger in stature 
<A NAME="69"></A>higher in price. A sheep is nice to eat and an elephant is 
<A NAME="70"></A>carrion.'
<A NAME="71"></A><BR><BR>The smallest mountain on earth is Jur; nevertheless
<A NAME="72"></A><BR>It is great with Allah in dignity and station.
<A NAME="73"></A><BR><BR>Hast thou not heard that a lean scholar
<A NAME="74"></A><BR>One day said to a fat fool:
<A NAME="75"></A><BR>'Although an Arab horse may be weak
<A NAME="76"></A><BR>It is thus more worth than a stable full of asses.'
<A NAME="77"></A><BR><BR>The father laughed at this sally, the pillars of the state approved 
<A NAME="78"></A>of it, but the brothers felt much aggrieved.
<A NAME="79"></A><BR><BR>While a man says not a word
<A NAME="80"></A><BR>His fault and virtue are concealed.
<A NAME="81"></A><BR>Think not that every desert is empty.
<A NAME="82"></A><BR>Possibly it may contain a sleeping tiger.
<A NAME="83"></A><BR><BR>I heard that on the said occasion the king was menaced by a powerful 
<A NAME="84"></A>enemy and that when the two armies were about to encounter each other, 
<A NAME="85"></A>the first who entered the battlefield was the little fellow who 
<A NAME="86"></A>said:
<A NAME="87"></A><BR><BR>'I am not he whose back thou wilt see on the day of 
<A NAME="88"></A>battle
<A NAME="89"></A><BR>But he whom thou shalt behold in dust and blood.
<A NAME="90"></A><BR>Who himself fights, stakes his own life
<A NAME="91"></A><BR>In battle but he who flees, the blood of his army.'
<A NAME="92"></A><BR><BR>After uttering these words he rushed among the troops of the enemy, 
<A NAME="93"></A>slew several warriors and, returning to his father, made humble obeisance 
<A NAME="94"></A>and said:
<A NAME="95"></A><BR><BR>'O thou, to whom my person appeared contemptible,
<A NAME="96"></A><BR>Didst not believe in the impetuosity of my valour.
<A NAME="97"></A><BR>A horse with slender girth is of use
<A NAME="98"></A><BR>On the day of battle, not a fattened ox.'
<A NAME="99"></A><BR><BR>It is related that the troops of the enemy were numerous, and that 
<A NAME="100"></A>the king's, being few, were about to flee, but that the puny youth raised 
<A NAME="101"></A>a shout, saying: 'O men, take care not to put on the garments of women.' 
<A NAME="102"></A>These words augmented the rage of the troopers so that they made a unanimous 
<A NAME="103"></A>attack and I heard that they gained the victory on the said occasion. The 
<A NAME="104"></A>king kissed the head and eyes of his son, took him in his arms and daily 
<A NAME="105"></A>augmented his affection till he appointed him to succeed him on the throne. 
<A NAME="106"></A>His brothers became envious and placed poison in his food but were perceived 
<A NAME="107"></A>by his sister from her apartment, whereon she closed the window violently 
<A NAME="108"></A>and the youth, shrewdly guessing the significance of the act, restrained 
<A NAME="109"></A>his hands from touching the food, and said: 'It is impossible that men 
<A NAME="110"></A>of honour should die, and those who possess none should take their 
<A NAME="111"></A>place.'
<A NAME="112"></A><BR><BR>No one goes under the shadow of an owl
<A NAME="113"></A><BR>Even if the homa should disappear from the world.
<A NAME="114"></A><BR><BR>This state of affairs having been brought to the notice of the 
<A NAME="115"></A>father, he severely reproved the brothers and assigned to each of them 
<A NAME="116"></A>a different, but pleasant, district as a place of exile till the confusion 
<A NAME="117"></A>was quelled and the quarrel appeased; and it has been said that ten dervishes 
<A NAME="118"></A>may sleep under the same blanket but that one country cannot hold two 
<A NAME="119"></A>padshahs.
<A NAME="120"></A><BR><BR>When a pious man eats half a loaf of bread
<A NAME="121"></A><BR>He bestows the other half upon dervishes.
<A NAME="122"></A><BR>If a padshah were to conquer the seven climates
<A NAME="123"></A><BR>He would still in the same way covet another.
<A NAME="124"></A><BR><BR>Story 4
<A NAME="125"></A><BR><BR>A band of Arab brigands having taken up their position on the top 
<A NAME="126"></A>of a mountain and closed the passage of caravans, the inhabitants of the 
<A NAME="127"></A>country were distressed by their stratagems and the troops of the sultan 
<A NAME="128"></A>foiled because the robbers, having obtained an inaccessible spot on the 
<A NAME="129"></A>summit of the mountain, thus had a refuge which they made their habitation. 
<A NAME="130"></A>The chiefs of that region held a consultation about getting rid of the 
<A NAME="131"></A>calamity because it would be impossible to offer resistance to the robbers 
<A NAME="132"></A>if they were allowed to remain.
<A NAME="133"></A><BR><BR>A tree which has just taken root
<A NAME="134"></A><BR>May be moved from the place by the strength of a 
<A NAME="135"></A>man
<A NAME="136"></A><BR>But, if thou leavest it thus for a long time,
<A NAME="137"></A><BR>Thou canst not uproot it with a windlass.
<A NAME="138"></A><BR>The source of a fountain may be stopped with a bodkin
<A NAME="139"></A><BR>But, when it is full, it cannot be crossed on an 
<A NAME="140"></A>elephant.
<A NAME="141"></A><BR><BR>The conclusion was arrived at to send one man as a spy and to wait 
<A NAME="142"></A>for the opportunity till the brigands departed to attack some people and 
<A NAME="143"></A>leave the place empty. Then several experienced men, who had fought in 
<A NAME="144"></A>battles, were despatched to keep themselves in ambush in a hollow of the 
<A NAME="145"></A>mountain. In the evening the brigands returned from their excursion with 
<A NAME="146"></A>their booty, divested themselves of their arms, put away their plunder 
<A NAME="147"></A>and the first enemy who attacked them was sleep, till about a watch of 
<A NAME="148"></A>the night had elapsed:
<A NAME="149"></A><BR><BR>The disk of the sun went into darkness.
<A NAME="150"></A><BR>Jonah went into the mouth of the fish.
<A NAME="151"></A><BR><BR>The warriors leapt forth from the ambush, tied the hands of every 
<A NAME="152"></A>one of the robbers to his shoulders and brought them in the morning to 
<A NAME="153"></A>the court of the king, who ordered all of them to be slain. There happened 
<A NAME="154"></A>to be a youth among them, the fruit of whose vigour was just ripening and 
<A NAME="155"></A>the verdure on the rose-garden of whose cheek had begun to sprout. One 
<A NAME="156"></A>of the veziers, having kissed the foot of the king's throne and placed 
<A NAME="157"></A>the face of intercession upon the ground, said: 'This boy has not yet eaten 
<A NAME="158"></A>any fruit from the garden of life and has not yet enjoyed the pleasures 
<A NAME="159"></A>of youth. I hope your majesty will generously and kindly confer an obligation 
<A NAME="160"></A>upon your slave by sparing his life.' The king, being displeased with this 
<A NAME="161"></A>request, answered:
<A NAME="162"></A><BR><BR>'He whose foundation is bad will not take instruction from the 
<A NAME="163"></A>good,
<A NAME="164"></A><BR>To educate unworthy persons is like throwing nuts on a 
<A NAME="165"></A>cupola.
<A NAME="166"></A><BR><BR>'It is preferable to extirpate the race and offspring of these 
<A NAME="167"></A>people and better to dig up their roots and foundations, because it is 
<A NAME="168"></A>not the part of wise men to extinguish fire and to leave burning coals 
<A NAME="169"></A>or to kill a viper and leave its young ones.
<A NAME="170"></A><BR><BR>If a cloud should rain the water of life
<A NAME="171"></A><BR>Never sip it from the branch of a willow-tree.
<A NAME="172"></A><BR>Associate not with a base fellow
<A NAME="173"></A><BR>Because thou canst not eat sugar from a mat-reed.'
<A NAME="174"></A><BR><BR>The vezier heard these sentiments, approved of them nolens volens, 
<A NAME="175"></A>praised the opinion of the king and said: 'What my lord has uttered is 
<A NAME="176"></A>the very truth itself because if the boy had been brought up in the company 
<A NAME="177"></A>of those wicked men, he would have become one of themselves. But your slave 
<A NAME="178"></A>hopes that he will, in the society of pious men, profit by education and 
<A NAME="179"></A>will acquire the disposition of wise persons. Being yet a child the rebellious 
<A NAME="180"></A>and perverse temper of that band has not yet taken hold of his nature and 
<A NAME="181"></A>there is a tradition of the prophet that every infant is born with an inclination 
<A NAME="182"></A>for Islam but his parents make him a Jew, a Christian or a 
<A NAME="183"></A>Majusi.'
<A NAME="184"></A><BR><BR>The spouse of Lot became a friend of wicked 
<A NAME="185"></A>persons.
<A NAME="186"></A><BR>His race of prophets became extinct.
<A NAME="187"></A><BR>The dog of the companions of the cave for some days
<A NAME="188"></A><BR>Associated with good people and became a man.
<A NAME="189"></A><BR><BR>When the vezier had said these words and some of the king's courtiers 
<A NAME="190"></A>had added their intercession to his, the king no longer desired to shed 
<A NAME="191"></A>the blood of the youth and said: 'I grant the request although I disapprove-of 
<A NAME="192"></A>it.'
<A NAME="193"></A><BR><BR>Knowest thou not what Zal said to the hero Rastam:
<A NAME="194"></A><BR>'An enemy cannot be held despicable or helpless.
<A NAME="195"></A><BR>I have seen many a water from a paltry spring
<A NAME="196"></A><BR>Becoming great and carrying off a camel with its 
<A NAME="197"></A>load.'
<A NAME="198"></A><BR><BR>In short, the vezier brought up the boy delicately, with every 
<A NAME="199"></A>comfort, and kept masters to educate him, till they had taught him to address 
<A NAME="200"></A>persons in elegant language as well as to reply and he had acquired every 
<A NAME="201"></A>accomplishment. One day the vezier hinted at his talents in the presence 
<A NAME="202"></A>of the king, asserting that the instructions of wise men had taken effect 
<A NAME="203"></A>upon the boy and had expelled his previous ignorance from his nature. The 
<A NAME="204"></A>king smiled at these words and said:
<A NAME="205"></A><BR><BR>'At last a wolf's whelp will be a wolf
<A NAME="206"></A><BR>Although he may grow up with a man.'
<A NAME="207"></A><BR><BR>After two years had elapsed a band of robbers in the locality joined 
<A NAME="208"></A>him, tied the knot of friendship and, when the opportunity presented itself, 
<A NAME="209"></A>he killed the vezier with his son, took away untold wealth and succeeded 
<A NAME="210"></A>to the position of his own father in the robber-cave where he established 
<A NAME="211"></A>himself. The king, informed of the event, took the finger of amazement 
<A NAME="212"></A>between his teeth and said:
<A NAME="213"></A><BR><BR>'How can a man fabricate a good sword of bad 
<A NAME="214"></A>iron?
<A NAME="215"></A><BR>O sage, who is nobody becomes not somebody by education.
<A NAME="216"></A><BR>The rain, in the beneficence of whose nature there is no 
<A NAME="217"></A>flaw,
<A NAME="218"></A><BR>Will cause tulips to grow in a garden and weeds in bad 
<A NAME="219"></A>soil.
<A NAME="220"></A><BR>Saline earth will not produce hyacinths.
<A NAME="221"></A><BR>Throw not away thy seeds or work thereon.
<A NAME="222"></A><BR>To do good to wicked persons is like Doing evil to good 
<A NAME="223"></A>men.'
<A NAME="224"></A><BR><BR>Story 5
<A NAME="225"></A><BR><BR>I saw at the palace-gate of Oglimish the son of a military officer 
<A NAME="226"></A>who was endued with marvellous intellect, sagacity, perception and shrewdness; 
<A NAME="227"></A>also the signs of future greatness manifested themselves on his forehead 
<A NAME="228"></A>whilst yet a small boy.
<A NAME="229"></A><BR><BR>From his head intelligence caused
<A NAME="230"></A><BR>The star of greatness to shine.
<A NAME="231"></A><BR><BR>In short, he pleased the sultan because he had a beautiful countenance 
<A NAME="232"></A>and a perfect understanding; and philosophers have said: 'Power consists 
<A NAME="233"></A>in accomplishments, not in wealth and greatness in intellect, not in years.' 
<A NAME="234"></A>His companions, being envious, made an attempt upon his life and desired 
<A NAME="235"></A>to kill him but their endeavours remained fruitless.
<A NAME="236"></A><BR><BR>What can a foe do when the friend is kind?
<A NAME="237"></A><BR><BR>The king asked: 'What is the cause of their enmity to thee?' He 
<A NAME="238"></A>replied: 'Under the shadow of the monarchy of my lord I have satisfied 
<A NAME="239"></A>my contemporaries except the envious, who will not be contented but by 
<A NAME="240"></A>the decline of my prosperity, and may the monarchy and good fortune of 
<A NAME="241"></A>my lord be perpetual.'
<A NAME="242"></A><BR><BR>I may so act as not to hurt the feelings of 
<A NAME="243"></A>anyone
<A NAME="244"></A><BR>But what can I do to an envious man dissatisfied with 
<A NAME="245"></A>himself?
<A NAME="246"></A><BR>Die, O envious man, for this is a malady,
<A NAME="247"></A><BR>Deliverance from which can be obtained only by death.
<A NAME="248"></A><BR>Unfortunate men sometimes ardently desire
<A NAME="249"></A><BR>The decline of prosperous men in wealth and dignity.
<A NAME="250"></A><BR>If in daytime, bat-eyed persons do not see
<A NAME="251"></A><BR>Is it the fault of the fountain of light, the sun?
<A NAME="252"></A><BR>Thou justly wishest that a thousand such eyes
<A NAME="253"></A><BR>Should be blind rather than the sun dark.
<A NAME="254"></A><BR><BR>Story 6
<A NAME="255"></A><BR><BR>It is narrated that one of the kings of Persia had stretched forth 
<A NAME="256"></A>his tyrannical hand to the possessions of his subjects and had begun to 
<A NAME="257"></A>oppress them so violently that in consequence of his fraudulent extortions 
<A NAME="258"></A>they dispersed in the world and chose exile on account of the affliction 
<A NAME="259"></A>entailed by his violence. When the population had diminished, the prosperity 
<A NAME="260"></A>of the country suffered, the treasury remained empty and on every side 
<A NAME="261"></A>enemies committed violence.
<A NAME="262"></A><BR><BR>Who desires succour in the day of calamity,

<A NAME="268"></A><BR><BR>One day the Shahnamah was read in his assembly, the subject being 
<A NAME="269"></A>the ruin of the dominion of Zohak and the reign of Feridun. The vezier 
<A NAME="270"></A>asked the king how it came to pass that Feridun, who possessed neither 
<A NAME="271"></A>treasure nor land nor a retinue, established himself upon the throne. He 
<A NAME="272"></A>replied: 'As thou hast heard, the population enthusiastically gathered 
<A NAME="273"></A>around him and supported him so that he attained royalty.' The vezier said: 
<A NAME="274"></A>'As the gathering around of the population is the cause of royalty, then 
<A NAME="275"></A>why dispersest thou the population? Perhaps thou hast no desire for 
<A NAME="276"></A>royalty?'
<A NAME="277"></A><BR><BR>It is best to cherish the army as thy life
<A NAME="278"></A><BR>Because a sultan reigns by means of his troops.
<A NAME="279"></A><BR><BR>The king asked: 'What is the reason for the gathering around of 
<A NAME="280"></A>the troops and the population?' He replied: 'A padshah must practise justice 
<A NAME="281"></A>that they may gather around him and clemency that they may dwell in safety 
<A NAME="282"></A>under the shadow of his government; but thou possessest neither of these 
<A NAME="283"></A>qualities.'
<A NAME="284"></A><BR><BR>A tyrannic man cannot be a sultan
<A NAME="285"></A><BR>As a wolf cannot be a shepherd.
<A NAME="286"></A><BR>A padshah who establishes oppression
<A NAME="287"></A><BR>Destroys the basis of the wall of his own reign.
<A NAME="288"></A><BR><BR>The king, displeased with the advice of his censorious vezier, 
<A NAME="289"></A>sent him to prison. Shortly afterwards the sons of the king's uncle rose 
<A NAME="290"></A>in rebellion, desirous of recovering the kingdom of their father. The population, 
<A NAME="291"></A>which had been reduced to the last extremity by the king's oppression and 
<A NAME="292"></A>scattered, now assembled around them and supported them, till he lost control 
<A NAME="293"></A>of the government and they took possession of it.
<A NAME="294"></A><BR><BR>A padshah who allows his subjects to be oppressed
<A NAME="295"></A><BR>Will in his day of calamity become a violent foe.
<A NAME="296"></A><BR>Be at peace with subjects and sit safe from attacks of 
<A NAME="297"></A>foes
<A NAME="298"></A><BR>Because his subjects are the army of a just shahanshah.
<A NAME="299"></A><BR><BR>Story 7
<A NAME="300"></A><BR><BR>A padshah was in the same boat with a Persian slave who had never 
<A NAME="301"></A>before been at sea and experienced the inconvenience of a vessel. He began 
<A NAME="302"></A>to cry and to tremble to such a degree that he could not be pacified by 
<A NAME="303"></A>kindness, so that at last the king became displeased as the matter could 
<A NAME="304"></A>not be remedied. In that boat there happened to be a philosopher, who said: 
<A NAME="305"></A>'With thy permission I shall quiet him.' The padshah replied: 'It will 
<A NAME="306"></A>be a great favour.' The philosopher ordered the slave to be thrown into 
<A NAME="307"></A>the water so that he swallowed some of it, whereon be was caught and pulled 
<A NAME="308"></A>by his hair to the boat, to the stern of which he clung with both his hands. 
<A NAME="309"></A>Then he sat down in a corner and became quiet. This appeared strange to 
<A NAME="310"></A>the king who knew not what wisdom there was in the proceeding and asked 
<A NAME="311"></A>for it. The philosopher replied: 'Before he had tasted the calamity of 
<A NAME="312"></A>being drowned, he knew not the safety of the boat; thus also a man does 
<A NAME="313"></A>not appreciate the value of immunity from a misfortune until it has befallen 
<A NAME="314"></A>him.'

<A NAME="323"></A><BR><BR>Hormuzd, being asked what fault the veziers of his father had committed 
<A NAME="324"></A>that he imprisoned them, replied: 'I discovered no fault. I saw that boundless 
<A NAME="325"></A>awe of me had taken root in their hearts but that they had no full confidence 
<A NAME="326"></A>in my promises, wherefore I apprehended that they, fearing calamities would 
<A NAME="327"></A>befall them, might attempt my life and I acted according to the maxim of 
<A NAME="328"></A>sages who have said:
<A NAME="329"></A><BR><BR>'Dread him who dreads thee, O sage,

<A NAME="337"></A><BR><BR>An Arab king was sick in his state of decrepitude so that all hopes 
<A NAME="338"></A>of life were cut off. A trooper entered the gate with the good news that 
<A NAME="339"></A>a certain fort had been conquered by the good luck of the king, that the 
<A NAME="340"></A>enemies had been captured and that the whole population of the district 
<A NAME="341"></A>had been reduced to obedience. The king heaved a deep sigh and replied: 
<A NAME="342"></A>'This message is not for me but for my enemies, namely the heirs of the 
<A NAME="343"></A>kingdom.'
<A NAME="344"></A><BR><BR>I spent my precious life in hopes, alas!

<A NAME="346"></A><BR>My wishes were realized, but to what profit? Since
<A NAME="347"></A><BR>There is no hope that my past life will return.
<A NAME="348"></A><BR>The hand of fate has struck the drum of departure.
<A NAME="349"></A><BR>O my two eyes, bid farewell to the head.

<A NAME="413"></A><BR><BR>'We have in the world no moment more delightful than

<A NAME="415"></A><BR>Because I care neither for good nor for bad nor for

<A NAME="417"></A><BR><BR>A naked dervish, who was sleeping outside in the cold, then

<A NAME="423"></A>a bag of a thousand dinars from the window and said: 'Dervish, spread out 
<A NAME="424"></A>thy skirt.' He replied: 'Whence can I, who have no robe, bring a skirt?' 
<A NAME="425"></A>The padshah took pity on his helpless condition, added a robe to his gift 
<A NAME="426"></A>and sent it out to him but the dervish squandered the money in a short 
<A NAME="427"></A>time and returned.
<A NAME="428"></A><BR><BR>Property cannot abide in the hands of the free,
<A NAME="429"></A><BR>Neither patience in the heart of a lover nor water in a

<A NAME="434"></A>to be on their guard against the violence and despotism of kings because 
<A NAME="435"></A>their thoughts are generally occupied with important affairs of state so 
<A NAME="436"></A>that they cannot bear to be importuned by the crowd of vulgar 
<A NAME="437"></A>persons.
<A NAME="438"></A><BR><BR>He will be excluded from the beneficence of the

<A NAME="442"></A><BR>Destroy not thy power by heedless talk.

<A NAME="452"></A>by thee, are unworthy of a generous disposition as also to encourage a

<A NAME="463"></A><BR><BR>One of the ancient kings neglected the government of his realm

<A NAME="470"></A><BR><BR>I was on terms of friendship with one of those who had acted treacherously 
<A NAME="471"></A>and reproached him, telling him that it was base, ungrateful, despicable 
<A NAME="472"></A>and undutiful to abandon an old master when his affairs have changed a 
<A NAME="473"></A>little and to disregard the obligations incurred for benefits received 
<A NAME="474"></A>during many years. He replied: 'If I inform thee, perhaps thou wilt excuse 
<A NAME="475"></A>me for my horse had no barley and my saddle-cloth was pawned. A sultan 
<A NAME="476"></A>who grudges money to his troops, they cannot bravely risk their lives for

<A NAME="478"></A><BR><BR>Give gold to the soldier that he may serve thee.

<A NAME="493"></A>intelligence who is able to carry on the administration of the government.' 
<A NAME="494"></A>He replied: 'It is a sign of sufficient intelligence not to engage in such

<A NAME="502"></A>again asked that, as he had entered into the shadow of the lion's protection 
<A NAME="503"></A>and gratefully acknowledged his beneficence, why he had not joined the 
<A NAME="504"></A>circle of intimacy so as to be accounted one of his favourite servants,

<A NAME="517"></A><BR><BR>Story 16
<A NAME="518"></A><BR><BR>One of my friends complained of the unpropitious times, telling 
<A NAME="519"></A>me that he had a slender income, a large family, without strength to bear 
<A NAME="520"></A>the load of poverty and had often entertained the idea to emigrate to another 
<A NAME="521"></A>country so that no matter how he made a living no one might become aware 
<A NAME="522"></A>of his good or ill luck.
<A NAME="523"></A><BR><BR>Many a man slept hungry and no one knew who he 
<A NAME="524"></A>was.
<A NAME="525"></A><BR>Many a man was at the point of death and no one wept for 
<A NAME="526"></A>him.
<A NAME="527"></A><BR><BR>He was also apprehensive of the malevolence of enemies who would 
<A NAME="528"></A>laugh behind his back and would attribute the struggle he underwent for 
<A NAME="529"></A>the benefit of his family to his want of manly independence and that they 
<A NAME="530"></A>will say:
<A NAME="531"></A><BR><BR>'Behold that dishonourable fellow who will never
<A NAME="532"></A><BR>See the face of prosperity,
<A NAME="533"></A><BR>Will choose bodily comfort for himself,
<A NAME="534"></A><BR>Abandoning his wife and children to misery.'
<A NAME="535"></A><BR><BR>He also told me that as I knew he possessed some knowledge of arithmetic, 
<A NAME="536"></A>I might, through my influence, get him appointed to a post which would 
<A NAME="537"></A>become the means of putting his mind at ease and place him under obligations 
<A NAME="538"></A>to me, which he could not requite by gratitude during the rest of his life. 
<A NAME="539"></A>I replied: 'Dear friend! Employment by a padshah consists of two parts, 
<A NAME="540"></A>namely, the hope for bread and the danger of life, but it is against the 
<A NAME="541"></A>opinion of intelligent men to incur this danger for that 
<A NAME="542"></A>hope.'
<A NAME="543"></A><BR><BR>No one comes to the house of a dervish
<A NAME="544"></A><BR>To levy a tax on land and garden.
<A NAME="545"></A><BR>Either consent to bear thy anxiety or grief
<A NAME="546"></A><BR>Or carry thy beloved children to the crows.
<A NAME="547"></A><BR><BR>He replied: 'Thou hast not uttered these words in conformity with 
<A NAME="548"></A>my case nor answered my question. Hast thou not heard the saying? "Whoever 
<A NAME="549"></A>commits treachery let his hand tremble at the account."'
<A NAME="550"></A><BR><BR>Straightness is the means of acceptance with 
<A NAME="551"></A>God.
<A NAME="552"></A><BR>I saw no one lost on the straight road.
<A NAME="553"></A><BR><BR>Sages have said: 'Four persons are for life in dread of four persons: 
<A NAME="554"></A>a robber of the sultan, a thief of the watchman, an adulterer of an informer, 
<A NAME="555"></A>and a harlot of the muhtasib. But what has he to fear whose account of 
<A NAME="556"></A>the conscience is clear?'
<A NAME="557"></A><BR><BR>Be not extravagant when in office, if thou desirest
<A NAME="558"></A><BR>On thy removal to see thy foes embarrassed for imputations 
<A NAME="559"></A>against
<A NAME="560"></A><BR>thee.
<A NAME="561"></A><BR>Be thou pure, O brother, and in fear of no one.
<A NAME="562"></A><BR>Washermen beat only impure garments against stones.
<A NAME="563"></A><BR><BR>I said: 'The story of that fox resembles thy case, who was by some 
<A NAME="564"></A>persons seen fleeing with much trouble and asked for the cause of his fear 
<A NAME="565"></A>replied: 'I have heard that camels are being forced into the service.' 
<A NAME="566"></A>They said: 'O fool, what connection hast thou with a camel and what resemblance 
<A NAME="567"></A>does the latter bear to thee?' The fox rejoined: 'Hush. If the envious 
<A NAME="568"></A>malevolently say that I am a camel and I am caught, who will care to release 
<A NAME="569"></A>me or investigate my case? Till the antidote is brought from Eraq the snake-bitten 
<A NAME="570"></A>person dies.' Thou art a very excellent and honest man but enemies sit 
<A NAME="571"></A>in ambush and competitors in every corner. If they describe thy character 
<A NAME="572"></A>in a contrary manner, thou wouldst be called upon to give explanations 
<A NAME="573"></A>to the padshah and incur reproof. Who would on that occasion venture to 
<A NAME="574"></A>say anything? Accordingly I am of opinion that thou shouldst retire to 
<A NAME="575"></A>the domain of contentment and abandon aspirations to dominion. Wise men 
<A NAME="576"></A>have said:
<A NAME="577"></A><BR><BR>'In the sea there are countless gains,
<A NAME="578"></A><BR>But if thou desirest safety, it will be on the shore.'
<A NAME="579"></A><BR><BR>My friend, having heard these words, became angry, made a wry face 
<A NAME="580"></A>and began to reproach me, saying: 'What sufficiency of wisdom and maturity 
<A NAME="581"></A>of intellect is this? The saying of philosophers has come true, that friends 
<A NAME="582"></A>are useful in prison because at table all enemies appear as 
<A NAME="583"></A>friends.'
<A NAME="584"></A><BR><BR>Account him not a friend who knocks at the door of 
<A NAME="585"></A>prosperity,
<A NAME="586"></A><BR>Boasts of amity and calls himself thy adopted brother.
<A NAME="587"></A><BR>I consider him a friend who takes a friend's hand
<A NAME="588"></A><BR>When he is in a distressed state and in poverty.
<A NAME="589"></A><BR><BR>Seeing that he had thus changed and ascribed my advice to an interested 
<A NAME="590"></A>motive, I paid a visit to the President of the State Council and, trusting 
<A NAME="591"></A>in my old acquaintance with him, explained the case of my friend whom he 
<A NAME="592"></A>then appointed to a small post. In a short time my friend's affable behaviour 
<A NAME="593"></A>and good management elicited approbation so that he was promoted to a higher 
<A NAME="594"></A>office. In this manner the star of his good luck ascended till he reached 
<A NAME="595"></A>the zenith of his aspirations, became a courtier of his majesty the sultan, 
<A NAME="596"></A>generally esteemed and trusted. I was delighted with his safe position 
<A NAME="597"></A>and said:
<A NAME="598"></A><BR><BR>'Be not apprehensive of tangled affairs and keep not a broken 
<A NAME="599"></A>heart
<A NAME="600"></A><BR>Because the spring of life is in darkness.'
<A NAME="601"></A><BR><BR>Do not grieve, O brother in misery,
<A NAME="602"></A><BR>Because the Ill-merciful has hidden favours.
<A NAME="603"></A><BR><BR>Sit not morose on account of the turns of time; for 
<A NAME="604"></A>patience,
<A NAME="605"></A><BR>Although bitter, nevertheless possesses a sweet 
<A NAME="606"></A>fruit.
<A NAME="607"></A><BR><BR>At that time I happened to go with a company of friends on a journey 
<A NAME="608"></A>to Mekkah and on my return he met me at a distance of two stages. I perceived 
<A NAME="609"></A>his outward appearance to be distressed, his costume being that of dervishes. 
<A NAME="610"></A>I asked: 'What is the matter?' He replied: 'As thou hast predicted, some 
<A NAME="611"></A>persons envied me and brought against me an accusation of treason. The 
<A NAME="612"></A>king ordered no inquiry on its truthfulness and my old well-wishers with 
<A NAME="613"></A>my kind friends who failed to speak the word of truth forgot our old 
<A NAME="614"></A>intimacy.
<A NAME="615"></A><BR><BR>'Seest thou not in front of the possessor of 
<A NAME="616"></A>dignity
<A NAME="617"></A><BR>They place the hands on their heads, praising him;
<A NAME="618"></A><BR>But, if fortune's turn causes his fall,
<A NAME="619"></A><BR>All desire to Place their foot on his head.
<A NAME="620"></A><BR><BR>'In short, I was till this week undergoing various persecutions, 
<A NAME="621"></A>when the news of the pilgrims' approach from Mekkah arrived, whereon I 
<A NAME="622"></A>was released from my heavy bonds and my hereditary property confiscated.' 
<A NAME="623"></A>I replied: 'Thou hast not paid attention to my remarks when I said that 
<A NAME="624"></A>the service of padshahs is like a sea voyage, profitable and dangerous, 
<A NAME="625"></A>so that thou wilt either gain a treasure or perish in the 
<A NAME="626"></A>waves.'
<A NAME="627"></A><BR><BR>The khajah either takes gold with both hands to the 
<A NAME="628"></A>shore
<A NAME="629"></A><BR>Or the waves throw him one day dead upon the shore.
<A NAME="630"></A><BR><BR>Not thinking it suitable to scratch the wound of the dervish more 
<A NAME="631"></A>than I had already done and so sprinkle salt thereon, I contented myself 
<A NAME="632"></A>with reciting the following two distichs:
<A NAME="633"></A><BR><BR>Knewest thou not that thou wilt see thy feet in 
<A NAME="634"></A>bonds
<A NAME="635"></A><BR>If the advice of people cannot penetrate into thy 
<A NAME="636"></A>ear?
<A NAME="637"></A><BR><BR>Again, if thou canst not bear the pain of the 
<A NAME="638"></A>sting
<A NAME="639"></A><BR>Put not thy finger into the hole of a scorpion.
<A NAME="640"></A><BR><BR>Story 17
<A NAME="641"></A><BR><BR>Several men were in my company whose external appearance displayed 
<A NAME="642"></A>the adornment of piety. A great man who had conceived a very good opinion 
<A NAME="643"></A>of these persons had assigned them a fixed allowance but, after one of 
<A NAME="644"></A>them had done something unbecoming the profession of dervishes, his opinion 
<A NAME="645"></A>changed and they fell into disgrace. I desired in some way to save the 
<A NAME="646"></A>allowance of my friends and intended to wait upon the great man but the 
<A NAME="647"></A>doorkeeper would not allow me to enter and was rude. I pardoned him, because 
<A NAME="648"></A>it has been said:
<A NAME="649"></A><BR><BR>The door of an amir, vezier or sultan
<A NAME="650"></A><BR>Is not to be approached without an introduction.
<A NAME="651"></A><BR>When a dog or a doorkeeper sees a stranger
<A NAME="652"></A><BR>The former takes hold of his skirt, the latter of his 
<A NAME="653"></A>collar.
<A NAME="654"></A><BR><BR>When those who could at any time approach the presence of the said 
<A NAME="655"></A>great man became aware of my case, they took me in with compliments and 
<A NAME="656"></A>desired to assign me a high seat but I humbly took a lower one and 
<A NAME="657"></A>said:
<A NAME="658"></A><BR><BR>'Allow me who am the smallest slave
<A NAME="659"></A><BR>To sit in the line of slaves.'
<A NAME="660"></A><BR><BR>He said: 'Allah, Allah, what need is there for such 
<A NAME="661"></A>words?'
<A NAME="662"></A><BR><BR>If thou sittest on my head and eyes
<A NAME="663"></A><BR>I shall be polite, for thou art polite.
<A NAME="664"></A><BR><BR>In short, I took a seat and we conversed on a variety of topics 
<A NAME="665"></A>till the affair of the error of my companions turned up and I 
<A NAME="666"></A>said:
<A NAME="667"></A><BR><BR>'What crime has my lord seen, who was bountiful,
<A NAME="668"></A><BR>To make the slave despicable in his sight?
<A NAME="669"></A><BR>To God that magnanimity and bounty is surrendered
<A NAME="670"></A><BR>Which beholds the crime but nevertheless bestows the 
<A NAME="671"></A>bread.'
<A NAME="672"></A><BR><BR>The governor, being pleased with these words, ordered the support 
<A NAME="673"></A>of my friends to be attended to as before and the arrears to be made good. 
<A NAME="674"></A>I expressed my gratitude, kissed the ground of obedience, apologized for 
<A NAME="675"></A>my boldness, and said:
<A NAME="676"></A><BR><BR>'Since the Ka'bah has become the Qiblah of wants from distant 
<A NAME="677"></A>lands
<A NAME="678"></A><BR>The people go to visit it from many farsangs.
<A NAME="679"></A><BR>Thou must suffer the importunity of such as we are
<A NAME="680"></A><BR>Because no one throws stones on a tree without fruit.'
<A NAME="681"></A><BR><BR>Story 18
<A NAME="682"></A><BR><BR>A royal prince, having inherited abundant treasures from his father, 
<A NAME="683"></A>opened the hand of liberality and satisfied his impulse of generosity by 
<A NAME="684"></A>lavishing without stint benefits upon the army and the 
<A NAME="685"></A>population.
<A NAME="686"></A><BR><BR>A tray of lignum aloes will emit no odour.
<A NAME="687"></A><BR>Place it on fire, it will smell like ambergris.
<A NAME="688"></A><BR>If thou wishest to be accounted great, be liberal
<A NAME="689"></A><BR>Because grain will not grow unless it be sown.
<A NAME="690"></A><BR><BR>One of his courtiers began heedlessly to admonish him, saying: 
<A NAME="691"></A>'Former kings have by their exertions accumulated this wealth and deposited 
<A NAME="692"></A>it for a useful purpose. Cease this movement because calamities may arise 
<A NAME="693"></A>in front and enemies in the rear. It is not meet for thee to be helpless 
<A NAME="694"></A>at a time of necessity.'
<A NAME="695"></A><BR><BR>If thou distributest a treasure to the multitude
<A NAME="696"></A><BR>Each householder will receive a grain of rice.
<A NAME="697"></A><BR>Why takest thou not from each a barley-corn of silver
<A NAME="698"></A><BR>That thou mayest accumulate every day a treasure?
<A NAME="699"></A><BR><BR>The royal prince turned away his face at these words and said: 
<A NAME="700"></A>'God the most high has made me the possessor of this country, to enjoy 
<A NAME="701"></A>and to bestow, not to guard and to retain.'
<A NAME="702"></A><BR><BR>Qarun, who possessed forty treasure houses, 
<A NAME="703"></A>perished.
<A NAME="704"></A><BR>Nushirvan has not died because he obtained a good 
<A NAME="705"></A>reputation.
<A NAME="706"></A><BR><BR>Story 19
<A NAME="707"></A><BR><BR>It is related that, whilst some game was being roasted for Nushirvan 
<A NAME="708"></A>the just during a hunting party, no salt could be found. Accordingly a 
<A NAME="709"></A>boy was sent to an adjoining village to bring some. Nushirvan said: 'Pay 
<A NAME="710"></A>for the salt lest it should become a custom and the village be ruined.' 
<A NAME="711"></A>Having been asked what harm could arise from such a trifling demand, Nushirvan 
<A NAME="712"></A>replied: 'The foundation of oppression was small in the world but whoever 
<A NAME="713"></A>came augmented it so that it reached its present magnitude.'
<A NAME="714"></A><BR><BR>If the king eats one apple from the garden of a 
<A NAME="715"></A>subject
<A NAME="716"></A><BR>His slaves will pull him up the tree from the roots.
<A NAME="717"></A><BR><BR>For five eggs which the sultan allows to be taken by 
<A NAME="718"></A>force
<A NAME="719"></A><BR>The people belonging to his army will put a thousand
<A NAME="720"></A><BR>fowls on the spit.
<A NAME="721"></A><BR><BR>A tyrant does not remain in the world
<A NAME="722"></A><BR>But the curse on him abides for ever.
<A NAME="723"></A><BR><BR>Story 20
<A NAME="724"></A><BR><BR>I heard that an oppressor ruined the habitations of the subjects 
<A NAME="725"></A>to fill the treasury of the sultan, unmindful of the maxim of philosophers, 
<A NAME="726"></A>who have said: 'Who offends God the most high to gain the heart of a created 
<A NAME="727"></A>being, God will use that very being to bring on his destruction in the 
<A NAME="728"></A>world.'
<A NAME="729"></A><BR><BR>Fire burning with wild rue will not
<A NAME="730"></A><BR>Cause a smoke like that of afflicted hearts.
<A NAME="731"></A><BR><BR>The prince of all animals is the lion and the meanest of beasts 
<A NAME="732"></A>the ass. Nevertheless sages agree that an ass who carries loads is better 
<A NAME="733"></A>than a lion who destroys men.
<A NAME="734"></A><BR><BR>The poor donkey though void of discernment
<A NAME="735"></A><BR>Is nevertheless esteemed when he carries a burden.
<A NAME="736"></A><BR>Oxen and asses who carry loads
<A NAME="737"></A><BR>Are superior to men oppressing mankind.
<A NAME="738"></A><BR><BR>When the king had obtained information of some of the oppressor's 
<A NAME="739"></A>misdeeds and bad conduct, he had him put on the rack and slain by various 
<A NAME="740"></A>tortures.
<A NAME="741"></A><BR><BR>Thou wilt not obtain the approbation of the 
<A NAME="742"></A>sultan
<A NAME="743"></A><BR>Unless thou seekest the goodwill of his subjects.
<A NAME="744"></A><BR>If thou desirest God to condone thy transgressions,
<A NAME="745"></A><BR>Do good to the people whom God has created.
<A NAME="746"></A><BR><BR>One of the oppressed who passed near him said:
<A NAME="747"></A><BR><BR>'Not everyone who possesses strength of arm and 
<A NAME="748"></A>office
<A NAME="749"></A><BR>In the sultanate may with impunity plunder the people.
<A NAME="750"></A><BR>A hard bone may be made to pass down the throat
<A NAME="751"></A><BR>But it will tear the belly when it sticks in the 
<A NAME="752"></A>navel.'
<A NAME="753"></A><BR><BR>Story 21
<A NAME="754"></A><BR><BR>It is narrated that an oppressor of the people, a soldier, hit 
<A NAME="755"></A>the head of a pious man with a stone and that the dervish, having no means 
<A NAME="756"></A>of taking vengeance, preserved the stone till the time arrived when the 
<A NAME="757"></A>king became angry with that soldier, and imprisoned him in a well. Then 
<A NAME="758"></A>the dervish made his appearance and dropped the stone upon his head. He 
<A NAME="759"></A>asked: 'Who art thou, and why hast thou hit my head with this stone?' The 
<A NAME="760"></A>man replied: 'I am the same person whom thou hast struck on the head with 
<A NAME="761"></A>this stone on such and such a day.' The soldier continued: 'Where hast 
<A NAME="762"></A>thou been all this time?' The dervish replied: 'I was afraid of thy dignity 
<A NAME="763"></A>but now when I beheld thee in the well I made use of the 
<A NAME="764"></A>opportunity.'
<A NAME="765"></A><BR><BR>When thou seest an unworthy man in good luck
<A NAME="766"></A><BR>Intelligent men have chosen submission.
<A NAME="767"></A><BR>If thou hast not a tearing sharp nail
<A NAME="768"></A><BR>It will be better not to contend with the wicked.
<A NAME="769"></A><BR>Who grasps with his fist one who has an arm of steel
<A NAME="770"></A><BR>Injures only his own powerless wrist.
<A NAME="771"></A><BR>Wait till inconstant fortune ties his hand.
<A NAME="772"></A><BR>Then, to please thy friends, pick out his brains.
<A NAME="773"></A><BR><BR>Story 22
<A NAME="774"></A><BR><BR>A king was subject to a terrible disease, the mention of which 
<A NAME="775"></A>is not sanctioned by custom. The tribe of Yunani physicians agreed that 
<A NAME="776"></A>this pain cannot be allayed except by means of the bile of a person endued 
<A NAME="777"></A>with certain qualities. Orders having been issued to search for an individual 
<A NAME="778"></A>of this kind, the son of a landholder was discovered to possess the qualities 
<A NAME="779"></A>mentioned by the doctors. The king summoned the father and mother of the 
<A NAME="780"></A>boy whose consent he obtained by giving them immense wealth. The qazi issued 
<A NAME="781"></A>a judicial decree that it is permissible to shed the blood of one subject 
<A NAME="782"></A>for the safety of the king and the executioner was ready to slay the boy 
<A NAME="783"></A>who then looked heavenwards and smiled. The king asked: 'What occasion 
<A NAME="784"></A>for laughter is there in such a position?' The youth replied: 'A son looks 
<A NAME="785"></A>to the affection of his father and mother to bring his case before the 
<A NAME="786"></A>qazi and to ask justice from the padshah. In the present instance, however, 
<A NAME="787"></A>the father and mother have for the trash of this world surrendered my blood, 
<A NAME="788"></A>the qazi has issued a decree to kill me, the sultan thinks he will recover 
<A NAME="789"></A>his health only through my destruction and I see no other refuge besides 
<A NAME="790"></A>God the most high.'
<A NAME="791"></A><BR><BR>To whom shall I complain against thy hand
<A NAME="792"></A><BR>If I am to seek justice also from thy hand?
<A NAME="793"></A><BR><BR>The sultan became troubled at these words, tears rushed to his 
<A NAME="794"></A>eyes and he said: 'It is better for me to perish than to shed innocent 
<A NAME="795"></A>blood.' He kissed the head and eyes of the youth, presented him with boundless 
<A NAME="796"></A>wealth and it is said that the king also recovered his health during that 
<A NAME="797"></A>week.
<A NAME="798"></A><BR><BR>I also remember the distich recited
<A NAME="799"></A><BR>By the elephant-driver on the bank of the Nile:
<A NAME="800"></A><BR>'If thou knewest the state of the ant under thy 
<A NAME="801"></A>foot
<A NAME="802"></A><BR>It is like thy own condition under the foot of an 
<A NAME="803"></A>elephant.'
<A NAME="804"></A><BR><BR>Story 23
<A NAME="805"></A><BR><BR>One of the servants of Umrulais had fled but some men, having been 
<A NAME="806"></A>sent in pursuit, brought him back. The vezier who bore a grudge towards 
<A NAME="807"></A>him desired him to be killed that the other servants may not imitate his 
<A NAME="808"></A>example. He placed his head on the ground before Umrulais and 
<A NAME="809"></A>said:
<A NAME="810"></A><BR><BR>'Whatever befalls my head is lawful with thy 
<A NAME="811"></A>approbation.
<A NAME="812"></A><BR>What plea can the slave advance? The sentence is the 
<A NAME="813"></A>master's.'
<A NAME="814"></A><BR><BR>'But, having been nourished by the bounty of this dynasty, I am 
<A NAME="815"></A>loth that on the day of resurrection thou shouldst be punished for having 
<A NAME="816"></A>shed my blood; but, if thou desirest to kill me, do so according to the 
<A NAME="817"></A>provisions of the law.' He asked: 'How am I to interpret it?' The slave 
<A NAME="818"></A>continued: 'Allow me to kill the vezier and then take my life in retaliation 
<A NAME="819"></A>so that I may be killed justly.' The king smiled and asked the vezier what 
<A NAME="820"></A>he thought of the matter. He replied: 'My lord, give freedom to this bastard 
<A NAME="821"></A>as an oblation to the tomb of thy father for fear he would bring trouble 
<A NAME="822"></A>on me likewise. It is my fault for not having taken account of the maxim 
<A NAME="823"></A>of philosophers who have said:
<A NAME="824"></A><BR><BR>When thou fightest with a thrower of clods
<A NAME="825"></A><BR>Thou ignorantly breakest thy own head.
<A NAME="826"></A><BR>When thou shootest an arrow at the face of a foe
<A NAME="827"></A><BR>Be on thy guard for thou art sitting as a target for 
<A NAME="828"></A>him.'
<A NAME="829"></A><BR><BR>Story 24
<A NAME="830"></A><BR><BR>King Zuzan had a khajah of noble sentiments and of good aspect 
<A NAME="831"></A>who served his companions when they were present and spoke well of them 
<A NAME="832"></A>when they were absent. He happened to do something whereby he incurred 
<A NAME="833"></A>the displeasure of the king who inflicted a fine on him and also otherwise 
<A NAME="834"></A>punished him. The officials of the king, mindful of the benefits they had 
<A NAME="835"></A>formerly received from him and being by them pledged to gratitude, treated 
<A NAME="836"></A>him kindly whilst in their custody and allowed no one to insult 
<A NAME="837"></A>him.
<A NAME="838"></A><BR><BR>If thou desirest peace from the foe, whenever 
<A NAME="839"></A>he
<A NAME="840"></A><BR>Finds fault behind thy back praise him to his face.
<A NAME="841"></A><BR>A vicious fellow's mouth must utter words.
<A NAME="842"></A><BR>If thou desirest not bitter words, sweeten his mouth.
<A NAME="843"></A><BR><BR>He was absolved of some accusations brought by the king against 
<A NAME="844"></A>him but retained in prison for some. Another king in those regions secretly 
<A NAME="845"></A>dispatched a message to him, to the purport that the sovereigns of that 
<A NAME="846"></A>country, not knowing his excellent qualities, had dishonoured him, but 
<A NAME="847"></A>that if his precious mind (may Allah prosper the end of his affairs) were 
<A NAME="848"></A>to look in this direction, the utmost efforts would be made to please him, 
<A NAME="849"></A>because the nobles of this realm would consider it an honour to see him 
<A NAME="850"></A>and are waiting for a reply to this letter. The khajah, who had received 
<A NAME="851"></A>this information, being apprehensive of danger, forthwith wrote a brief 
<A NAME="852"></A>and suitable answer on the back of the sheet of paper and sent it back. 
<A NAME="853"></A>One, however, of the king's courtiers, who noticed what had taken place, 
<A NAME="854"></A>reported to him that the imprisoned khajah was in correspondence with the 
<A NAME="855"></A>princes of the adjacent country. The king became angry and desired this 
<A NAME="856"></A>affair to be investigated. The courier was overtaken and deprived of the 
<A NAME="857"></A>letter, the contents of which were found on perusal to be as follows: 'The 
<A NAME="858"></A>good opinion of high personages is more than their servant's merit deserves, 
<A NAME="859"></A>who is unable to comply with the honour of reception which they have offered 
<A NAME="860"></A>him, because having been nourished by the bounty of this dynasty, he cannot 
<A NAME="861"></A>become unthankful towards his benefactor in consequence of a slight change 
<A NAME="862"></A>of sentiments of the latter, since it is said:
<A NAME="863"></A><BR><BR>He who bestows every moment favours upon thee
<A NAME="864"></A><BR>Is to be pardoned by thee if once in his life he injures 
<A NAME="865"></A>thee.'
<A NAME="866"></A><BR><BR>The king approved of his gratitude, bestowed upon him a robe of 
<A NAME="867"></A>honour, gave him presents and asked his pardon, saying: 'I committed a 
<A NAME="868"></A>mistake.' He replied: 'My lord, it was the decree of God the most high 
<A NAME="869"></A>that a misfortune should befall this servant but it was best that it should 
<A NAME="870"></A>come from thy hands which had formerly bestowed favours upon him and placed 
<A NAME="871"></A>him under obligations.'
<A NAME="872"></A><BR><BR>If people injure thee grieve not
<A NAME="873"></A><BR>Because neither rest nor grief come from the people.
<A NAME="874"></A><BR>Be aware that the contrasts of friend and foe are from 
<A NAME="875"></A>God
<A NAME="876"></A><BR>Because the hearts of both are in his keeping.

<A NAME="878"></A><BR>Wise men look at the archer.
<A NAME="879"></A><BR><BR>Story 25
<A NAME="880"></A><BR><BR>One of the Arab kings ordered his officials to double the allowance 
<A NAME="881"></A>of a certain attendant because he was always at the palace expecting orders 
<A NAME="882"></A>while the other servants were engaged in amusements and sports, neglecting 
<A NAME="883"></A>their duties. A pious man who heard this remarked that high degrees at 
<A NAME="884"></A>the court of heaven are similarly bestowed upon servants:
<A NAME="885"></A><BR><BR>If a man comes two mornings to serve the shah
<A NAME="886"></A><BR>He will on the third certainly look benevolently on 
<A NAME="887"></A>him.
<A NAME="888"></A><BR>Sincere worshippers entertain the hope
<A NAME="889"></A><BR>That they will not be disappointed at the threshold of 
<A NAME="890"></A>God.
<A NAME="891"></A><BR><BR>Superiority consists in attending to commands.
<A NAME="892"></A><BR>The neglect of commands leads to exclusion.

<A NAME="894"></A><BR>Places the head upon the threshold.
<A NAME="895"></A><BR><BR>Story 26
<A NAME="896"></A><BR><BR>It is narrated that a tyrant who purchased wood from dervishes 
<A NAME="897"></A>forcibly gave it away to rich -people gratuitously. A pious man passing 
<A NAME="898"></A>near said:
<A NAME="899"></A><BR><BR>'Thou art a snake, stingest whom thou beholdest,
<A NAME="900"></A><BR>Or an owl; wherever thou sittest thou destroyest.
<A NAME="901"></A><BR><BR>Although thy oppression may pass among us
<A NAME="902"></A><BR>It cannot pass with the Lord who knows all secrets.
<A NAME="903"></A><BR><BR>Oppress not the denizens of the earth
<A NAME="904"></A><BR>That their supplications may not pass to heaven.'
<A NAME="905"></A><BR><BR>The tyrant, being displeased with these words, got angry and took 
<A NAME="906"></A>no notice of him until one night, when fire from the kitchen fell into 
<A NAME="907"></A>the store of his wood and burnt all he possessed-transferring him from 
<A NAME="908"></A>his soft bed to a hot mound of ashes-the same pious man happened again 
<A NAME="909"></A>to pass and to hear him saying to his friends: 'I do not know whence this 
<A NAME="910"></A>fire has fallen into my house.' replied: 'From the smoke of the hearts 
<A NAME="911"></A>of dervishes.'
<A NAME="912"></A><BR><BR>Beware of the smoke of internal wounds
<A NAME="913"></A><BR>Because at last an internal wound will break out.
<A NAME="914"></A><BR>Forbear to uproot one heart as long as thou canst
<A NAME="915"></A><BR>Because one sigh may uproot a world.
<A NAME="916"></A><BR><BR>Upon the diadem of Kaikhosru the following piece was

<A NAME="918"></A><BR><BR>For how many years and long lives
<A NAME="919"></A><BR>Will the people walk over my head on the ground?
<A NAME="920"></A><BR>As from hand to hand the kingdom came to us
<A NAME="921"></A><BR>So it will also go to other hands.
<A NAME="922"></A><BR><BR>Story 27
<A NAME="923"></A><BR><BR>A man had attained great excellence in the art of wrestling, who 
<A NAME="924"></A>knew three hundred and sixty exquisite tricks and daily exhibited something 
<A NAME="925"></A>new. He had a particular affection for the beauty of one of his pupils 
<A NAME="926"></A>whom he taught three hundred and fifty-nine tricks, refraining to impart 
<A NAME="927"></A>to him only one. At last the youth had attained such power and skill that 
<A NAME="928"></A>no one was able to contend with him and he went so far as to say to the 
<A NAME="929"></A>sultan: 'I allow superiority to my teacher on account of his age and from 
<A NAME="930"></A>gratitude for his instruction but my strength is not less than his and 
<A NAME="931"></A>my skill equal.' The king, who was not pleased with this want of good manners, 
<A NAME="932"></A>ordered them to wrestle with each other and a spacious locality having 
<A NAME="933"></A>been fixed upon, the pillars of state and courtiers of his majesty made 
<A NAME="934"></A>their appearance. The youth made an onslaught like a mad elephant with 
<A NAME="935"></A>an impulse which might have uprooted a mountain of brass from its place 
<A NAME="936"></A>but the master, who knew that he was in strength superior to himself, attacked 
<A NAME="937"></A>him with the rare trick he had reserved to himself and which the youth 
<A NAME="938"></A>was unable to elude; whereon the master, lifting him up with his hands 
<A NAME="939"></A>from the ground, raised him above his head and then threw him down. Shouts 
<A NAME="940"></A>were raised by the spectators and the king ordered a robe of honour with 
<A NAME="941"></A>other presents to be given to the teacher but reproached and blamed the 
<A NAME="942"></A>youth for having attempted to cope with his instructor and succumbed. He 
<A NAME="943"></A>replied: 'My lord, he has not vanquished me by his strength but there was 
<A NAME="944"></A>a slender part in the art of wrestling which he had withheld from me and 
<A NAME="945"></A>had today thereby got the upper hand of me.' The master said: 'I had reserved 
<A NAME="946"></A>it for such an occasion because wise men have said: "Do not give so much 
<A NAME="947"></A>strength to thy friend that, if he becomes thy foe, he may injure thee." 
<A NAME="948"></A>Hast thou not heard what the man said who suffered molestation from one 
<A NAME="949"></A>whom he had educated?
<A NAME="950"></A><BR><BR>Either fidelity itself does not exist in this 
<A NAME="951"></A>world
<A NAME="952"></A><BR>Or nobody practices it in our time.
<A NAME="953"></A><BR>No one had learnt archery from me
<A NAME="954"></A><BR>Without at last making a target of me.'
<A NAME="955"></A><BR><BR>Story 28
<A NAME="956"></A><BR><BR>A solitary dervish was sitting in a corner of the desert when a 
<A NAME="957"></A>padshah happened to pass by but, ease having made him independent, he took 
<A NAME="958"></A>no notice. The sultan, in conformity with his royal dignity, became angry 
<A NAME="959"></A>and said: 'This tribe of rag-wearers resembles beasts.' The vezier said: 
<A NAME="960"></A>'The padshah of the surface of the earth has passed near thee. Why hast 
<A NAME="961"></A>thou not paid homage and shown good manners?' He replied: 'Tell the king 
<A NAME="962"></A>to look for homage from a man who expects benefits from him and also that 
<A NAME="963"></A>kings exist for protecting subjects and subjects not for obeying 
<A NAME="964"></A>kings.'
<A NAME="965"></A><BR><BR>The padshah is the guardian of the dervish
<A NAME="966"></A><BR>Although wealth is in the glory of his reign.
<A NAME="967"></A><BR>The sheep is not for the shepherd
<A NAME="968"></A><BR>But the shepherd for the service of it.
<A NAME="969"></A><BR><BR>Today thou beholdest one man prosperous
<A NAME="970"></A><BR>And another whose heart is wounded by struggling.
<A NAME="971"></A><BR>Wait a few days till the earth consumes
<A NAME="972"></A><BR>The brain in the head of the visionary.
<A NAME="973"></A><BR>Distinction between king and slave has ceased
<A NAME="974"></A><BR>When the decree of fate overtakes them.
<A NAME="975"></A><BR>If a man were to open the tombs of the dead
<A NAME="976"></A><BR>He would not distinguish a rich from a poor man.
<A NAME="977"></A><BR><BR>The king, who was pleased with the sentiments of the dervish, asked 
<A NAME="978"></A>him to make a request but he answered that the only one he had to make 
<A NAME="979"></A>was to be left alone. The king then asked for advice and the dervish 
<A NAME="980"></A>said:
<A NAME="981"></A><BR><BR>'Understand now while wealth is in thy hand
<A NAME="982"></A><BR>That fortune and kingdom will leave thy hand.'
<A NAME="983"></A><BR><BR>Story 29
<A NAME="984"></A><BR><BR>A vezier paid a visit to Zulnun Misri and asked for his favour, 
<A NAME="985"></A>saying: 'I am day and night engaged in the service of the sultan and hoping 
<A NAME="986"></A>to be rewarded but nevertheless dread to be punished by him.' Zulnun wept 
<A NAME="987"></A>and said: 'Had I feared God, the great and glorious, as thou fearest the 
<A NAME="988"></A>sultan, I would be one of the number of the righteous.'
<A NAME="989"></A><BR><BR>If there were no hope of rest and trouble
<A NAME="990"></A><BR>The foot of the dervish would be upon the sphere
<A NAME="991"></A><BR>And if the vezier feared God
<A NAME="992"></A><BR>Like the king he would be king.
<A NAME="993"></A><BR><BR>Story 30
<A NAME="994"></A><BR><BR>A padshah having issued orders to kill an innocent man, the latter 
<A NAME="995"></A>said: 'O king, seek not thine own injury on account of the anger thou bearest 
<A NAME="996"></A>towards me.' He asked: 'How?' The man replied: 'This punishment will abide 
<A NAME="997"></A>with me one moment but the sin of it for ever with thee.'
<A NAME="998"></A><BR><BR>The period of life has passed away like the desert 
<A NAME="999"></A>wind.
<A NAME="1000"></A><BR>Bitter and sweet, ugliness and beauty have passed 
<A NAME="1001"></A>away.
<A NAME="1002"></A><BR>The tyrant fanded he had done injury to us.
<A NAME="1003"></A><BR>It remained on his neck and passed away from us.
<A NAME="1004"></A><BR><BR>This admonition having taken effect, the king spared his 
<A NAME="1005"></A>blood.
<A NAME="1006"></A><BR><BR>Story 31
<A NAME="1007"></A><BR><BR>The veziers of Nushirvan happened to discuss an important affair 
<A NAME="1008"></A>of state, each giving his opinion according to his knowledge. The king 
<A NAME="1009"></A>likewise gave his opinion and Barzachumihr concurred with it. Afterwards 
<A NAME="1010"></A>the veziers secretly asked him: 'What superiority hast thou discovered 
<A NAME="1011"></A>in the opinion of the king above so many other reflections of wise men?' 
<A NAME="1012"></A>The philosopher replied: 'Since the termination of the affair is unknown 
<A NAME="1013"></A>and it depends upon the will of God whether the opinion of the others will 
<A NAME="1014"></A>turn out right or wrong, it was better to agree with the opinion of the 
<A NAME="1015"></A>king so that, if it should turn out to have been wrong, we may, on account 
<A NAME="1016"></A>of having followed it, remain free from blame.'
<A NAME="1017"></A><BR><BR>To proffer an opinion contrary to the king's
<A NAME="1018"></A><BR>Means to wash the hands in one's own blood.
<A NAME="1019"></A><BR>Should he in plain day say it is night,
<A NAME="1020"></A><BR>It is meet to shout: 'Lo, the moon and the pleiads!'
<A NAME="1021"></A><BR><BR>Story 32
<A NAME="1022"></A><BR><BR>An impostor arranged his hair in a peculiar fashion, pretended 
<A NAME="1023"></A>to be a descendant of A'li and entered the town with a caravan from the 
<A NAME="1024"></A>Hejaz, saying that he had just arrived from a pilgrimage. He also presented 
<A NAME="1025"></A>an elegy to the king, alleging that he had himself composed it. One of 
<A NAME="1026"></A>the king's courtiers, who had that year returned from a journey, said: 
<A NAME="1027"></A>'I have seen him at Bosrah on the Azhah festival, then how can he be a 
<A NAME="1028"></A>Haji?' Another said: 'His father was a Christian at Melitah. How can he 
<A NAME="1029"></A>be a descendant of A'li? And his poetry has been found in the Divan of 
<A NAME="1030"></A>Anvari.' The king ordered him to be beaten and expelled the country for 
<A NAME="1031"></A>his great mendacity. The man said: 'O lord of the surface of the earth, 
<A NAME="1032"></A>I shall say something more and, if it is not true, I shall deserve any 
<A NAME="1033"></A>punishment which thou mayest decree.' He asked: 'What is 
<A NAME="1034"></A>it?'
<A NAME="1035"></A><BR><BR>When a stranger brings before thee buttermilk
<A NAME="1036"></A><BR>Two measures of it will be water and a spoonful sour 
<A NAME="1037"></A>milk.
<A NAME="1038"></A><BR>If thou hast heard heedless talk from thy slave, be not 
<A NAME="1039"></A>offended.
<A NAME="1040"></A><BR>A man who has seen the world utters much falsehood.
<A NAME="1041"></A><BR><BR>The king laughed, told him that all his life he had not uttered 
<A NAME="1042"></A>more true words than these and ordered the present which the fellow hoped 
<A NAME="1043"></A>for to be got ready.
<A NAME="1044"></A><BR><BR>Story 33
<A NAME="1045"></A><BR><BR>One of the veziers of a king treated his subordinates with kindness 
<A NAME="1046"></A>and sought the goodwill of his colleagues. Once he happened to be called 
<A NAME="1047"></A>to account by the king for something he had done whereon his colleagues 
<A NAME="1048"></A>endeavoured to effect his liberation. Those who guarded him treated him 
<A NAME="1049"></A>leniently and the great men expatiated upon his good character to the padshah 
<A NAME="1050"></A>till he renounced all further inquiry. A pious man who took cognizance 
<A NAME="1051"></A>of this affair said:
<A NAME="1052"></A><BR><BR>'In order to gain the hearts of friends
<A NAME="1053"></A><BR>Sell even the garden of thy father.
<A NAME="1054"></A><BR>In order to boil the pot of well-wishers
<A NAME="1055"></A><BR>Burn even all the furniture of the house.
<A NAME="1056"></A><BR>Do good even to a malevolent fellow.
<A NAME="1057"></A><BR>Tie up the mouth of the dog with a sop.'
<A NAME="1058"></A><BR><BR>Story 34
<A NAME="1059"></A><BR><BR>One of the sons of Harun-ur-Rashid went to his father and angrily 
<A NAME="1060"></A>informed him that the son of an official had used insulting expressions 
<A NAME="1061"></A>towards him whereon Harun asked his courtiers what requital he deserved. 
<A NAME="1062"></A>One of them proposed capital punishment, another the amputation of the 
<A NAME="1063"></A>tongue whilst a third recommended fine and imprisonment. Then Harun said: 
<A NAME="1064"></A>'Oh my son, it would be generous to pardon him but, if thou art unable 
<A NAME="1065"></A>to do so, use likewise insulting expressions concerning his mother; not 
<A NAME="1066"></A>however to such a degree as to exceed the bounds of vengeance because in 
<A NAME="1067"></A>that case the wrong will be on thy side.'
<A NAME="1068"></A><BR><BR>He is not reputed a man by the wise
<A NAME="1069"></A><BR>Who contends with a furious elephant
<A NAME="1070"></A><BR>But he is a man in reality
<A NAME="1071"></A><BR>Who when angry speaks not idle words.
<A NAME="1072"></A><BR><BR>An ill-humoured fellow insulted a man
<A NAME="1073"></A><BR>Who patiently bore it saying: 'O hopeful youth,
<A NAME="1074"></A><BR>I am worse than thou speakest of me
<A NAME="1075"></A><BR>For I am more conscious of my faults than thou.'
<A NAME="1076"></A><BR><BR>Story 35
<A NAME="1077"></A><BR><BR>I was sitting in a vessel with a company of great men when a boat 
<A NAME="1078"></A>which contained two brothers happened to sink near us. One of the great 
<A NAME="1079"></A>men promised a hundred dinars to a sailor if he could save them both. Whilst 
<A NAME="1080"></A>however the sailor was pulling out one, the other perished. I said: 'He 
<A NAME="1081"></A>had no longer to live and therefore delay took place in rescuing him.' 
<A NAME="1082"></A>The sailor smiled and replied: 'What thou hast said is certain. Moreover, 
<A NAME="1083"></A>I preferred to save this one because, when I once-happened to lag behind 
<A NAME="1084"></A>in the desert, he seated me on his camel, whereas I had received a whipping 
<A NAME="1085"></A>by the hands of the other. When I was a boy I recited: He, who doth right, 
<A NAME="1086"></A>doth it to his own soul and he, who doth evil, doth it against the 
<A NAME="1087"></A>same.'
<A NAME="1088"></A><BR><BR>As long as thou canst, scratch the interior of no 
<A NAME="1089"></A>one
<A NAME="1090"></A><BR>Because there are thorns on this road.
<A NAME="1091"></A><BR>Be helpful in the affairs of a dervish
<A NAME="1092"></A><BR>Because thou also hast affairs.
<A NAME="1093"></A><BR><BR>Story 36
<A NAME="1094"></A><BR><BR>There were two brothers: one of them in the service of the sultan 
<A NAME="1095"></A>and the other gaining his livelihood by the effort of his arm. The wealthy 
<A NAME="1096"></A>man once asked his destitute brother why he did not serve the sultan in 
<A NAME="1097"></A>order to be delivered from the hardship of labouring. He replied: 'Why 
<A NAME="1098"></A>labourest thou not to be delivered from the baseness of service because 
<A NAME="1099"></A>philosophers have said that it is better to eat barley bread and to sit 
<A NAME="1100"></A>than to gird oneself with a golden belt and to stand in 
<A NAME="1101"></A>service?'
<A NAME="1102"></A><BR><BR>To leaven mortar of quicklime with the hand
<A NAME="1103"></A><BR>Is better than to hold them on the breast before the 
<A NAME="1104"></A>amir.
<A NAME="1105"></A><BR><BR>My precious life was spent in considering
<A NAME="1106"></A><BR>What I am to eat in summer and wear in winter.
<A NAME="1107"></A><BR>O ignoble belly, be satisfied with one bread
<A NAME="1108"></A><BR>Rather than to bend the back in service.
<A NAME="1109"></A><BR><BR>Story 37
<A NAME="1110"></A><BR><BR>Someone had brought information to Nushirvan the just that an enemy 
<A NAME="1111"></A>of his had been removed from this world by God the most high. He asked: 
<A NAME="1112"></A>'Hast thou heard anything about his intending to spare 
<A NAME="1113"></A>me?'
<A NAME="1114"></A><BR><BR>There is no occasion for our rejoicing at a foe's 
<A NAME="1115"></A>death
<A NAME="1116"></A><BR>Because our own life will also not last for ever.
<A NAME="1117"></A><BR><BR>Story 38
<A NAME="1118"></A><BR><BR>A company of philosophers were discussing a subject in the palace 
<A NAME="1119"></A>of Kesra and Barzachumihr, having remained silent, they asked him why he 
<A NAME="1120"></A>took no share in the debate. He replied: 'Veziers are like physicians and 
<A NAME="1121"></A>the latter give medicine to the sick only but, as I perceive that your 
<A NAME="1122"></A>opinions are in conformity with propriety, I have nothing to say about 
<A NAME="1123"></A>them.'
<A NAME="1124"></A><BR><BR>When an affair succeeds without my idle talk
<A NAME="1125"></A><BR>It is not meet for me to speak thereon.
<A NAME="1126"></A><BR>But if I see a blind man near a well
<A NAME="1127"></A><BR>It is a crime for me to remain silent.
<A NAME="1128"></A><BR><BR>Story 39
<A NAME="1129"></A><BR><BR>Harun-ur-Rashid said when the country of Egypt was surrendered 
<A NAME="1130"></A>to him: 'In contrast to the rebel who had in his arrogance of being sovereign 
<A NAME="1131"></A>of Egypt pretended to be God, I shall bestow this country upon the meanest 
<A NAME="1132"></A>of my slaves.' He had a stupid negro, Khosaib by name, whom he made governor 
<A NAME="1133"></A>of Egypt but his intellect and discrimination were so limited that when 
<A NAME="1134"></A>the tribe of Egyptian agriculturists complained and stated that they had 
<A NAME="1135"></A>sown cotton along the banks of the Nile and that an untimely rain had destroyed 
<A NAME="1136"></A>it he replied: 'You ought to have sown wool.' A pious man heard this, and 
<A NAME="1137"></A>said:
<A NAME="1138"></A><BR><BR>'If livelihood were increased by knowledge
<A NAME="1139"></A><BR>None would be more needy than the ignorant.
<A NAME="1140"></A><BR>Nevertheless the ignorant receive a livelihood
<A NAME="1141"></A><BR>At which the learned stand aghast.
<A NAME="1142"></A><BR>The luck of wealth consists not in skill
<A NAME="1143"></A><BR>But only in the aid of heaven.
<A NAME="1144"></A><BR>It happens in the world that many
<A NAME="1145"></A><BR>Silly men are honoured and sages despised.
<A NAME="1146"></A><BR>If an alchemist has died in grief and misery,
<A NAME="1147"></A><BR>A fool discovered a treasure amidst ruins.'
<A NAME="1148"></A><BR><BR>Story 40
<A NAME="1149"></A><BR><BR>A Chinese slave-girl having been brought to a king, he desired 
<A NAME="1150"></A>to have connection with her whilst in a state of intoxication but, as she 
<A NAME="1151"></A>repelled him, he became angry and presented her to one of his negro-slaves 
<A NAME="1152"></A>whose upper lip was higher than his nostrils whilst the lower one hung 
<A NAME="1153"></A>down to his neck. His stature was such that the demon Sakhrah would have 
<A NAME="1154"></A>been put to flight and a fountain of pitch emitted stench from his 
<A NAME="1155"></A>armpits.
<A NAME="1156"></A><BR><BR>Thou wouldst say that, till the resurrection, 
<A NAME="1157"></A>ugliness
<A NAME="1158"></A><BR>Is his stamp as that of Joseph was beauty.
<A NAME="1159"></A><BR>His person was of so wretched an aspect
<A NAME="1160"></A><BR>That his ugliness surpassed all description
<A NAME="1161"></A><BR>And from his armpits we take refuge with Allah,
<A NAME="1162"></A><BR>They were like a corpse in the month of Merdad.
<A NAME="1163"></A><BR><BR>At that time the desire of the negro was libidinous, his lust overcame 
<A NAME="1164"></A>him, his love leapt up and he took off the seal of her virginity. In the 
<A NAME="1165"></A>morning the king sought the girl but could not find her and, having obtained 
<A NAME="1166"></A>information of what had taken place, he became angry, ordered the negro 
<A NAME="1167"></A>and the girl to be firmly tied together by their hands and feet and to 
<A NAME="1168"></A>be thrown from the lofty building into a ditch. One of the veziers, placing 
<A NAME="1169"></A>the face of intercession upon the ground, pleaded that there was no guilt 
<A NAME="1170"></A>in the negro since all the servants of his majesty usually receive presents 
<A NAME="1171"></A>and benefits as he had received the girl. The king rejoined: 'What would 
<A NAME="1172"></A>it have mattered if he had for one night delayed his enjoyment?' He said: 
<A NAME="1173"></A>'My lord, hast thou not heard that it was said:
<A NAME="1174"></A><BR><BR>When a man with a burning thirst reaches a limpid 
<A NAME="1175"></A>spring,
<A NAME="1176"></A><BR>Think not that he will care for a mad elephant.
<A NAME="1177"></A><BR>When a hungry infidel is in an empty house at table
<A NAME="1178"></A><BR>Reason will not believe that he cares for the Ramazan.'
<A NAME="1179"></A><BR><BR>The king, being pleased with this sally, exclaimed: 'I make thee 
<A NAME="1180"></A>a present of the negro. What am I to do with the girl?' He replied: 'Give 
<A NAME="1181"></A>the girl to the negro because that half is also due to a dog of which he 
<A NAME="1182"></A>has consumed the other half.'
<A NAME="1183"></A><BR><BR>The thirsty heart does not wish for limpid water
<A NAME="1184"></A><BR>Half of which was consumed by a fetid mouth.
<A NAME="1185"></A><BR><BR>How can the king's hand again touch
<A NAME="1186"></A><BR>An orange after it has fallen into dung?
<A NAME="1187"></A><BR><BR>Story 41
<A NAME="1188"></A><BR><BR>Iskandur Rumi, having been asked how he had conquered the east 
<A NAME="1189"></A>and the west, considering that the treasures, territories, reigns and armies 
<A NAME="1190"></A>of former kings exceeded his own and they had not gained such a victory, 
<A NAME="1191"></A>replied: 'Whatever country I conquered by the aid of God the most high, 
<A NAME="1192"></A>I abstained from distressing its population and spoke nothing but good 
<A NAME="1193"></A>of the king.'
<A NAME="1194"></A><BR><BR>The intelligent will not call him great
<A NAME="1195"></A><BR>Who speaks ill of the great.
<A NAME="1196"></A><BR><BR>All this is nothing as it passes away:
<A NAME="1197"></A><BR>Throne and luck, command and prohibition, taking and 
<A NAME="1198"></A>giving.
<A NAME="1199"></A><BR>Injure not the name of those who have passed away
<A NAME="1200"></A><BR>In order that thy own name may subsist.
