<BR><BR>
<A NAME="11"></A>Story 1
<A NAME="12"></A><BR><BR>A vezier who had a stupid son gave him in charge of a scholar to 
<A NAME="13"></A>instruct him and if possible to make him intelligent. Having been some 
<A NAME="14"></A>time under instruction but ineffectually, the learned man sent one to his 
<A NAME="15"></A>father with the words: 'The boy is not becoming intelligent and has made 
<A NAME="16"></A>a fool of me.'
<A NAME="17"></A><BR><BR>When a nature is originally receptive
<A NAME="18"></A><BR>Instruction will take effect thereon.
<A NAME="19"></A><BR>No kind of polishing will improve iron
<A NAME="20"></A><BR>Whose essence is originally bad.
<A NAME="21"></A><BR>Wash a dog in the seven oceans,
<A NAME="22"></A><BR>He will be only dirtier when he gets wet.
<A NAME="23"></A><BR>If the ass of Jesus be taken to Mekkah
<A NAME="24"></A><BR>He will on his return still be an ass.
<A NAME="25"></A><BR>Story 2
<A NAME="26"></A><BR><BR>A sage, instructing boys, said to them: 'O darlings of your fathers, 
<A NAME="27"></A>learn a trade because property and riches of the world are not to be relied 
<A NAME="28"></A>upon; also silver and gold are an occasion of danger because either a thief 
<A NAME="29"></A>may steal them at once or the owner spend them gradually; but a profession 
<A NAME="30"></A>is a living fountain and permanent wealth; and although a professional 
<A NAME="31"></A>man may lose riches, it does not matter because a profession is itself 
<A NAME="32"></A>wealth and wherever he goes he will enjoy respect and sit in high places, 
<A NAME="33"></A>whereas he who has no trade will glean crumbs and see 
<A NAME="34"></A>hardships:
<A NAME="35"></A><BR><BR>It is difficult to obey after losing dignity
<A NAME="36"></A><BR>And to bear violence from men after being caressed.
<A NAME="37"></A><BR><BR>Once confusion arose in Damascus.
<A NAME="38"></A><BR>Everyone left his snug corner.
<A NAME="39"></A><BR>Learned sons of peasants
<A NAME="40"></A><BR>Became the veziers of padshahs.
<A NAME="41"></A><BR>Imbecile sons of the veziers
<A NAME="42"></A><BR>Went as mendicants to peasants.
<A NAME="43"></A><BR><BR>If you wanted thy father's inheritance, acquire his 
<A NAME="44"></A>knowledge
<A NAME="45"></A><BR>Because this property of his may be spent in ten 
<A NAME="46"></A>days.
<A NAME="47"></A><BR><BR>Story 3
<A NAME="48"></A><BR><BR>An illustrious scholar, who was the tutor of a royal prince, had 
<A NAME="49"></A>the habit of striking him unceremoniously and treating him severely. The 
<A NAME="50"></A>boy, who could no longer bear this violence, went to his father to complain 
<A NAME="51"></A>and when he had taken off his coat, the father's heart was moved with pity. 
<A NAME="52"></A>Accordingly he called for the tutor and said: 'Thou dost not permit thyself 
<A NAME="53"></A>to indulge in so much cruelty towards the children of my subjects as thou 
<A NAME="54"></A>inflictest upon my son. What is the reason?' He replied: 'It is incumbent 
<A NAME="55"></A>upon all persons in general to converse in a sedate manner and to behave 
<A NAME="56"></A>in a laudable way but more especially upon padshahs because whatever they 
<A NAME="57"></A>say or do is commented on by everybody, the utterances or acts of common 
<A NAME="58"></A>people being of no such consequence.
<A NAME="59"></A><BR><BR>'If a hundred unworthy things are committed by a 
<A NAME="60"></A>dervish
<A NAME="61"></A><BR>His companions do not know one in a hundred.
<A NAME="62"></A><BR>But if a padshah utters only one jest
<A NAME="63"></A><BR>It is borne from country to country.
<A NAME="64"></A><BR><BR>'It is the duty of a royal prince's tutor to train up the sons 
<A NAME="65"></A>of his lord in refinement of morals-and Allah caused her to grow up as 
<A NAME="66"></A>a beautiful plant-more diligently than the sons of common 
<A NAME="67"></A>people.'
<A NAME="68"></A><BR><BR>He whom thou hast not punished when a child
<A NAME="69"></A><BR>Will not prosper when he becomes a man.
<A NAME="70"></A><BR>While a stick is green, thou canst bend it as thou 
<A NAME="71"></A>listest.
<A NAME="72"></A><BR>When it is dry, fire alone can make it straight.
<A NAME="73"></A><BR><BR>The king, being pleased with the appropriate discipline of the 
<A NAME="74"></A>tutor and with his explanatory reply, bestowed upon him a robe of honour 
<A NAME="75"></A>with other gifts and raised him to a higher position.
<A NAME="76"></A><BR><BR>Story 4
<A NAME="77"></A><BR><BR>I saw a schoolmaster in the Maghrib country, who was sour-faced, 
<A NAME="78"></A>of uncouth speech, ill-humoured, troublesome to the people, of a beggarly 
<A NAME="79"></A>nature and without self-restraint, so that the very sight of him disgusted 
<A NAME="80"></A>the Musalmans and when reading the Quran he distressed the hearts of the 
<A NAME="81"></A>people. A number of innocent boys and little maidens suffered from the 
<A NAME="82"></A>hand of his tyranny, venturing neither to laugh nor to speak because he 
<A NAME="83"></A>would slap the silver-cheeks of some and put the crystal legs of others 
<A NAME="84"></A>into the stocks. In short, I heard that when his behaviour had attained 
<A NAME="85"></A>some notoriety, he was expelled from the school and another installed as 
<A NAME="86"></A>corrector, who happened to be a religious, meek, good and wise man. He 
<A NAME="87"></A>spoke only when necessary and found no occasion to deal harshly with anyone 
<A NAME="88"></A>so that the children lost the fear they had entertained for their first 
<A NAME="89"></A>master and, taking advantage of the angelic manners of the second, they 
<A NAME="90"></A>acted like demons towards each other and, trusting in his gentleness, neglected 
<A NAME="91"></A>their studies, spending most of their time in play, and breaking on the 
<A NAME="92"></A>heads of each other the tablets' of their unfinished 
<A NAME="93"></A>tasks.
<A NAME="94"></A><BR><BR>If the schoolmaster happens to be lenient
<A NAME="95"></A><BR>The children will play leapfrog in the bazar.
<A NAME="96"></A><BR><BR>Two weeks afterwards I happened to pass near that same mosque where 
<A NAME="97"></A>I again saw the first master whom the people had made glad by reconciliation 
<A NAME="98"></A>and had reinstalled in his post. I was displeased, exclaimed 'La haul', 
<A NAME="99"></A>and asked why they had again made Iblis the teacher of angels. An old man, 
<A NAME="100"></A>experienced in the world, who had heard me, smiled and said: 'Hast thou 
<A NAME="101"></A>not heard the maxim?
<A NAME="102"></A><BR><BR>A padshah placed his son in a school,
<A NAME="103"></A><BR>Putting in his lap a silver tablet
<A NAME="104"></A><BR>With this inscription in golden letters:
<A NAME="105"></A><BR>The severity of a teacher is better than the love of a 
<A NAME="106"></A>father.'
<A NAME="107"></A><BR><BR>Story 5
<A NAME="108"></A><BR><BR>The son of a pious man inherited great wealth left him by some 
<A NAME="109"></A>uncles, whereon he plunged into dissipation and profligacy, became a spendthrift 
<A NAME="110"></A>and, in short, left no heinous transgression unperpetrated and no intoxicant 
<A NAME="111"></A>untasted. I advised him and said: 'My son, income is a flowing water and 
<A NAME="112"></A>expense a turning mill; that is to say, only he who has a fixed revenue 
<A NAME="113"></A>is entitled to indulge in abundant expenses.
<A NAME="114"></A><BR><BR>'If thou hast no income, spend but frugally
<A NAME="115"></A><BR>Because the sailors chant this song:
<A NAME="116"></A><BR>"If there be no rain in the mountains
<A NAME="117"></A><BR>The bed of the Tigris will be dry in one year."
<A NAME="118"></A><BR><BR>'Follow wisdom and propriety, abandon play and sport because thy 
<A NAME="119"></A>wealth will be exhausted, whereon thou wilt fall into trouble and will 
<A NAME="120"></A>repent.' The youth was prevented by the delights of the flute and of drink 
<A NAME="121"></A>from accepting my admonition but found fault therewith, saying that it 
<A NAME="122"></A>is contrary to the opinion of intelligent men to embitter present tranquillity 
<A NAME="123"></A>by cares concerning the future:
<A NAME="124"></A><BR><BR>Why should possessors of enjoyment and luck
<A NAME="125"></A><BR>Bear sorrow for fear of distress?
<A NAME="126"></A><BR>Go, be merry, my heart-rejoicing friend.
<A NAME="127"></A><BR>The pain of tomorrow must not be eaten today.
<A NAME="128"></A><BR><BR>And how could I restrain myself, who am occupying the highest seat 
<A NAME="129"></A>of liberality, have bound the knot of generosity and the fame of whose 
<A NAME="130"></A>beneficence has become the topic of general conversation?
<A NAME="131"></A><BR><BR>Who has become known for his liberality and 
<A NAME="132"></A>generosity
<A NAME="133"></A><BR>Must not put a lock upon his dirhems.
<A NAME="134"></A><BR>When the name of a good fellow has spread in a locality
<A NAME="135"></A><BR>The door cannot be dosed against it.
<A NAME="136"></A><BR><BR>When I perceived that he did not accept my advice and that my warm 
<A NAME="137"></A>breath was not taking effect upon his cold iron, I left off admonishing 
<A NAME="138"></A>him and turned away my face from his companionship, acting according to 
<A NAME="139"></A>the words of philosophers, who said: Impart to them what thou hast and 
<A NAME="140"></A>if they receive it not, it is not thy fault.
<A NAME="141"></A><BR><BR>Although thou knowest thou wilt not be heard, 
<A NAME="142"></A>say
<A NAME="143"></A><BR>Whatever thou knowest of good wishes and advice.
<A NAME="144"></A><BR>It may soon happen that thou wilt behold a silly 
<A NAME="145"></A>fellow
<A NAME="146"></A><BR>With both his feet fallen into captivity,
<A NAME="147"></A><BR>Striking his hands together, and saying: 'Alas,
<A NAME="148"></A><BR>I have not listened to the advice of a scholar.'
<A NAME="149"></A><BR><BR>After some time I saw the consequences of his dissolute behaviour-which 
<A NAME="150"></A>I apprehended-realized. When I beheld him sewing patch upon patch and gathering 
<A NAME="151"></A>crumb after crumb, my heart was moved with pity for his destitute condition, 
<A NAME="152"></A>in which I did not consider it humane to scratch his internal wounds with 
<A NAME="153"></A>reproaches or to sprinkle salt upon them. Accordingly, I said to 
<A NAME="154"></A>myself:
<A NAME="155"></A><BR><BR>A foolish fellow in the height of intoxication
<A NAME="156"></A><BR>Cares not for the coming day of distress.
<A NAME="157"></A><BR>The tree which sheds its foliage in spring
<A NAME="158"></A><BR>Will certainly have no leaves remaining in winter.
<A NAME="159"></A><BR><BR>Story 6
<A NAME="160"></A><BR><BR>A padshah entrusted a tutor with the care of his son, saying: 'This 
<A NAME="161"></A>is thy son. Educate him as if he were one of thy own children.' He kept 
<A NAME="162"></A>the prince for some years and strove to instruct him but could effect nothing, 
<A NAME="163"></A>whilst the sons of the tutor made the greatest progress in accomplishments 
<A NAME="164"></A>and eloquence. The king reproved and threatened the learned man with punishment, 
<A NAME="165"></A>telling him that he had acted contrary to his promise and had been unfaithful. 
<A NAME="166"></A>He replied: 'O king, the instruction is the same but the natures are 
<A NAME="167"></A>different.'
<A NAME="168"></A><BR><BR>Although both silver and gold come from stones
<A NAME="169"></A><BR>All stones do not contain silver and gold.
<A NAME="170"></A><BR>Canopus is shining upon the whole world
<A NAME="171"></A><BR>But produces in some places sack-leather and in others 
<A NAME="172"></A>adim.
<A NAME="173"></A><BR><BR>Story 7
<A NAME="174"></A><BR><BR>I heard a pir-instructor say to his murid: 'The mind of man is 
<A NAME="175"></A>so much occupied with thoughts about maintenance that he would surpass 
<A NAME="176"></A>the position of angels if he were to devote as many of them to the giver 
<A NAME="177"></A>of maintenance.'
<A NAME="178"></A><BR><BR>Yazed has not forgotten thee at the time
<A NAME="179"></A><BR>When thou wast sperm, buried, insensible.
<A NAME="180"></A><BR>He gave thee a soul, nature, intellect and perception,
<A NAME="181"></A><BR>Beauty, speech, opinion, meditation and acuteness.
<A NAME="182"></A><BR>He arranged five fingers on thy fist.
<A NAME="183"></A><BR>He fixed two arms to thy shoulders.
<A NAME="184"></A><BR>O thou whose aspirations are base, thinkest he will 
<A NAME="185"></A>now
<A NAME="186"></A><BR>Forget to provide thee with a maintenance?
<A NAME="187"></A><BR><BR>Story 8
<A NAME="188"></A><BR><BR>I saw an Arab of the desert who said to his boy: 'O son, on the 
<A NAME="189"></A>day of resurrection thou wilt be asked what thou hast gained and not from 
<A NAME="190"></A>whom thou art descended, that is to say, thou wilt be asked what thy merit 
<A NAME="191"></A>is and not who thy father was.'
<A NAME="192"></A><BR><BR>The covering of the Ka'bah which is kissed
<A NAME="193"></A><BR>Has not been ennobled by the silkworm.
<A NAME="194"></A><BR>It was some days in company with a venerable man
<A NAME="195"></A><BR>Wherefore it became respected like himself.
<A NAME="196"></A><BR><BR>Story 9
<A NAME="197"></A><BR><BR>It is narrated in the compositions of philosophers that scorpions 
<A NAME="198"></A>are not born in the same manner like other living beings but that they 
<A NAME="199"></A>devour the bowels of their mother and, after gnawing through the belly, 
<A NAME="200"></A>betake themselves to the desert. The skins which may be seen in the nests 
<A NAME="201"></A>of scorpions are the evidence of this. I narrated this story to an illustrious 
<A NAME="202"></A>man who then told me that his own heart bore witness to the truth of it 
<A NAME="203"></A>for the case could not be otherwise inasmuch as they, having in their infancy 
<A NAME="204"></A>dealt thus with their fathers and mothers, they were beloved and respected 
<A NAME="205"></A>in the same manner when they grow old.
<A NAME="206"></A><BR><BR>A father thus admonished his son:
<A NAME="207"></A><BR>O noble fellow, remember this advice.
<A NAME="208"></A><BR>'Whoever is not faithful to his origin
<A NAME="209"></A><BR>Will not become the companion of happiness.'
<A NAME="210"></A><BR><BR>A scorpion, having been asked why he did not go out in winter, 
<A NAME="211"></A>replied: 'What honour do I enjoy in summer that I should come out also 
<A NAME="212"></A>in winter?'
<A NAME="213"></A><BR><BR>Story 10
<A NAME="214"></A><BR><BR>The wife of a dervish had become enceinte and when the time of 
<A NAME="215"></A>her confinement was at hand, the dervish who had no child during all his 
<A NAME="216"></A>life said: 'If God the most high and glorious presents me with a son, I 
<A NAME="217"></A>shall bestow everything I possess as alms upon dervishes, except this patched 
<A NAME="218"></A>garment of mine which I am wearing.' It happened that the infant was a 
<A NAME="219"></A>son. He rejoiced and gave a banquet to the dervishes, as he had promised. 
<A NAME="220"></A>Some years afterwards when I returned from a journey to Syria, I passed 
<A NAME="221"></A>near the locality of the dervish and asked about his circumstances but 
<A NAME="222"></A>was told that he had been put in prison by the police. Asking for the cause, 
<A NAME="223"></A>I was told that his son, having become drunk, quarrelled and having shed 
<A NAME="224"></A>the blood of a man, had fled; whereon his father was instead of him loaded 
<A NAME="225"></A>with a chain on his neck and heavy fetters on his legs. I replied: 'He 
<A NAME="226"></A>had himself asked God the most high and glorious for this 
<A NAME="227"></A>calamity.'
<A NAME="228"></A><BR><BR>If pregnant women, O man of intellect,
<A NAME="229"></A><BR>Bring forth serpents at the time of birth,
<A NAME="230"></A><BR>It is better in the opinion of the wise
<A NAME="231"></A><BR>Than to give birth to a wicked progeny.
<A NAME="232"></A><BR><BR>Story 11
<A NAME="233"></A><BR><BR>When I was a child I asked an illustrious man about puberty. He 
<A NAME="234"></A>replied: 'It is recorded in books that it has three signs. First, the age 
<A NAME="235"></A>of fifteen years; secondly nocturnal pollutions; and thirdly, sprouting 
<A NAME="236"></A>of hair on the pudenda; but in reality there is only one sign which is 
<A NAME="237"></A>sufficient that thou shouldst seek the approbation of the most high and 
<A NAME="238"></A>glorious rather than to be in the bondage of sensual pleasures; and whoever 
<A NAME="239"></A>does not entertain this disposition is by erudite men considered not to 
<A NAME="240"></A>have attained puberty.'
<A NAME="241"></A><BR><BR>The form of man was attained by a drop of water
<A NAME="242"></A><BR>Which remained forty days in the womb.
<A NAME="243"></A><BR>If in forty years it has not attained sense and 
<A NAME="244"></A>propriety
<A NAME="245"></A><BR>It can in reality not be called a man.
<A NAME="246"></A><BR>Virility consists in liberality and amiableness.
<A NAME="247"></A><BR>Think not that it is only in the material figure.
<A NAME="248"></A><BR>Virtue is necessary because the form may be painted
<A NAME="249"></A><BR>In halls with vermilion or verdigris.
<A NAME="250"></A><BR>If a man possesses not excellence and goodness
<A NAME="251"></A><BR>What is the difference between him and a picture on the 
<A NAME="252"></A>wall?
<A NAME="253"></A><BR>It is no virtue to gain the whole world.
<A NAME="254"></A><BR>Gain the heart of one person if thou canst.
<A NAME="255"></A><BR><BR>Story 12
<A NAME="256"></A><BR><BR>One year discord had arisen in a caravan among the walking portion 
<A NAME="257"></A>and I also travelled on foot. To obtain justice we attacked each other's 
<A NAME="258"></A>heads and faces, giving full vent to pugnacity and contention. I saw a 
<A NAME="259"></A>man sitting in a camel litter and saying to his companion: 'How wonderful! 
<A NAME="260"></A>A pawn of ivory travels across the chess-board and becomes a farzin, and 
<A NAME="261"></A>the footmen of the Haj travelled across the whole desert only to become 
<A NAME="262"></A>worse.'

<A NAME="269"></A><BR><BR>An Indian who was learning how to throw naphtha was thus reproved 
<A NAME="270"></A>by a sage: 'This is not a play for thee whose house is made of

<A NAME="272"></A><BR><BR>Speak not unless thou knowest it is perfectly 
<A NAME="273"></A>proper

<A NAME="276"></A><BR><BR>Story 14
<A NAME="277"></A><BR><BR>A little man with a pain in his eyes went to a farrier to be treated 
<A NAME="278"></A>by him. The farrier applied to his eyes what he used to put in those of 
<A NAME="279"></A>quadrupeds so that the man became blind and lodged a complaint with the 
<A NAME="280"></A>judge who, however, refrained from punishing the farrier, saying: 'Had 
<A NAME="281"></A>this man not been an ass, he would not have gone to a farrier.' The moral 
<A NAME="282"></A>of this story is to let thee know that whoever entrusts an inexperienced 
<A NAME="283"></A>man with an important business and afterwards repents is by intelligent 
<A NAME="284"></A>persons held to suffer from levity of intellect.
<A NAME="285"></A><BR><BR>A shrewd and enlightened man will not give
<A NAME="286"></A><BR>Affairs of importance to a base fellow to transact.

<A NAME="289"></A><BR><BR>Story 15
<A NAME="290"></A><BR><BR>An illustrious man had a worthy son who died. Being asked what 
<A NAME="291"></A>he desired to be written upon the sarcophagus of the tomb, he replied: 
<A NAME="292"></A>'The verses of the glorious book' are deserving of more honour than to 
<A NAME="293"></A>be written on such a spot, where they would be injured by the lapse of 
<A NAME="294"></A>time, would be walked upon by persons passing by and urinated upon by dogs. 
<A NAME="295"></A>If anything is necessarily to be written, let what follows 
<A NAME="296"></A>suffice:
<A NAME="297"></A><BR><BR>Wah! How-every time the plants in the garden
<A NAME="298"></A><BR>Sprouted-glad became my heart.
<A NAME="299"></A><BR>Pass by, O friend, that in the spring
<A NAME="300"></A><BR>Thou mayest see plants sprouting from my loam.'
<A NAME="301"></A><BR><BR>Story 16
<A NAME="302"></A><BR><BR>A pious man happened to pass near a rich fellow who had a slave 
<A NAME="303"></A>and was just chastising him after having tied his feet and hands. He said: 
<A NAME="304"></A>'My son, God the most high and glorious has given a creature like thyself 
<A NAME="305"></A>into thy power and has bestowed upon thee superiority over him. Give thanks 
<A NAME="306"></A>to the Almighty and do not indulge in so much violence towards the man 
<A NAME="307"></A>because it is not meet that in the morn of resurrection he should be better 
<A NAME="308"></A>than thyself and put thee to shame.'
<A NAME="309"></A><BR><BR>Be not much incensed against a slave.
<A NAME="310"></A><BR>Oppress him not, grieve not his heart.
<A NAME="311"></A><BR>Thou hast purchased him for ten dirhems
<A NAME="312"></A><BR>And hast not after all created him by thy power.
<A NAME="313"></A><BR>How long is this command, pride and power to last?
<A NAME="314"></A><BR>There is a Master more exalted than thou.
<A NAME="315"></A><BR>O thou owner of Arslan and of Aghosh,
<A NAME="316"></A><BR>Do not forget him who is thy commander.
<A NAME="317"></A><BR><BR>There is a tradition that the prince of the world, upon whom be 
<A NAME="318"></A>the benediction of Allah and peace, has said: 'It will occasion the greatest 
<A NAME="319"></A>sorrow on the day of resurrection when a pious worshipper is conveyed to 
<A NAME="320"></A>paradise and a lord of profligacy to hell.'
<A NAME="321"></A><BR><BR>Upon the slave subject to thy service
<A NAME="322"></A><BR>Vent not boundless anger but treat him gently
<A NAME="323"></A><BR>Because on the day of reckoning it will be a shame
<A NAME="324"></A><BR>To see the slave free and his owner in chains.
<A NAME="325"></A><BR><BR>Story 17
<A NAME="326"></A><BR><BR>One year I travelled from Balkh with Damascenes and the road being 
<A NAME="327"></A>full of danger on account of robbers, a young man accompanied us as an 
<A NAME="328"></A>escort. He was expert with the shield and the bow, handled every weapon 
<A NAME="329"></A>and so strong that ten men were not able to span his bow-string. Moreover 
<A NAME="330"></A>the athletes of the face of the earth could not bend his back down to the 
<A NAME="331"></A>ground. He was, however, rich, brought up in the shade, without experience 
<A NAME="332"></A>in the world, the drum-sounds of warriors never having reached his ears 
<A NAME="333"></A>nor the lightning of the swords of horsemen dazzled his 
<A NAME="334"></A>eyes.
<A NAME="335"></A><BR><BR>He had not fallen prisoner into the hands of a 
<A NAME="336"></A>foe.
<A NAME="337"></A><BR>No shower of arrows had rained around him.
<A NAME="338"></A><BR><BR>I happened to be running together with this youth, who threw down 
<A NAME="339"></A>by the force of his arm every wall that came in his way, and pulled up 
<A NAME="340"></A>by the strength of his fist every big tree he saw, exclaiming, 
<A NAME="341"></A>boastingly:
<A NAME="342"></A><BR><BR>Where is the elephant that he may see the shoulders of the 
<A NAME="343"></A>heroes?
<A NAME="344"></A><BR>Where is the lion that he may see the fists of men?
<A NAME="345"></A><BR><BR>On that occasion two Indians showed their heads from behind a rock, 
<A NAME="346"></A>desirous to attack us. One of them had a club in his hand whilst the other 
<A NAME="347"></A>showed a sling under his arm. I asked our youth what he was waiting 
<A NAME="348"></A>for.
<A NAME="349"></A><BR><BR>Show what thou hast of bravery and strength
<A NAME="350"></A><BR>For here is the foe, coming on his own feet to the 
<A NAME="351"></A>grave.
<A NAME="352"></A><BR><BR>I saw the arrow and bow falling from the hands of the young man 
<A NAME="353"></A>and his bones trembling:
<A NAME="354"></A><BR><BR>Not everyone who splits a hair with a cuirass-piercing 
<A NAME="355"></A>arrow
<A NAME="356"></A><BR>Can, on the day of attack by warriors, extricate his 
<A NAME="357"></A>feet.
<A NAME="358"></A><BR><BR>We saw no other remedy but to abandon our baggage, arms and clothes, 
<A NAME="359"></A>whereby we saved our lives.
<A NAME="360"></A><BR><BR>Employ an experienced man in important affairs
<A NAME="361"></A><BR>Who is able to ensnare a fierce lion with his lasso.
<A NAME="362"></A><BR>A youth, though he may have a strong arm and elephant-body,
<A NAME="363"></A><BR>His joints will snap asunder for fear in contact with a 
<A NAME="364"></A>foe.
<A NAME="365"></A><BR>The issue of a battle is known by a tried man before the 
<A NAME="366"></A>contest
<A NAME="367"></A><BR>Like the solution of a legal question to a learned 
<A NAME="368"></A>man.
<A NAME="369"></A><BR><BR>Story 18
<A NAME="370"></A><BR><BR>I noticed the son of a rich man, sitting on the grave of his father 
<A NAME="371"></A>and quarreling with a dervish-boy, saying: 'The sarcophagus of my father's 
<A NAME="372"></A>tomb is of stone and its epitaph is elegant. The pavement is of marble, 
<A NAME="373"></A>tesselated with turquois-like bricks. But what resembles thy father's grave? 
<A NAME="374"></A>It consists of two contiguous bricks with two handfuls of mud thrown over 
<A NAME="375"></A>it.' The dervish-boy listened to all this and then observed: 'By the time 
<A NAME="376"></A>thy father is able to shake off those heavy stones which cover him, mine 
<A NAME="377"></A>will have reached paradise.'
<A NAME="378"></A><BR><BR>An ass with a light burden
<A NAME="379"></A><BR>No doubt walks easily.
<A NAME="380"></A><BR><BR>A dervish who carries only the load of poverty
<A NAME="381"></A><BR>Will also arrive lightly burdened at the gate of 
<A NAME="382"></A>death
<A NAME="383"></A><BR>Whilst he who lived in happiness, wealth and ease
<A NAME="384"></A><BR>Will undoubtedly on all these accounts die hard.
<A NAME="385"></A><BR>At all events, a prisoner who escapes from all his 
<A NAME="386"></A>bonds
<A NAME="387"></A><BR>Is to be considered more happy than an amir taken 
<A NAME="388"></A>prisoner.
<A NAME="389"></A><BR><BR>Story 19
<A NAME="390"></A><BR><BR>I asked an illustrious man for the reason of the tradition: Account 
<A NAME="391"></A>as an enemy the passion which is between thy two loins. He replied: 'The 
<A NAME="392"></A>reason is because whatever enemy thou propitiatest becomes thy friend, 
<A NAME="393"></A>whereas the more thou indulgest in a passion, the more it will oppose 
<A NAME="394"></A>thee.'
<A NAME="395"></A><BR><BR>Man attains angelic nature by eating sparingly
<A NAME="396"></A><BR>But if he be voracious like beasts he falls like a 
<A NAME="397"></A>stone.
<A NAME="398"></A><BR>He whose wishes thou fulfillest will obey thy command
<A NAME="399"></A><BR>Contrary to passion, which will command, when obeyed.
<A NAME="400"></A><BR><BR>Story 20
<A NAME="401"></A><BR><BR>Contention of Sa'di with a Disputant concerning Wealth and 
<A NAME="402"></A>Poverty
<A NAME="403"></A><BR><BR>I saw a man in the form but not with the character of a dervish, 
<A NAME="404"></A>sitting in an assembly, who had begun a quarrel; and, having opened the 
<A NAME="405"></A>record of complaints, reviled wealthy men, alleging at last that the hand 
<A NAME="406"></A>of power of dervishes to do good was tied and that the foot of the intention 
<A NAME="407"></A>of wealthy men to do good was broken.
<A NAME="408"></A><BR><BR>The liberal have no money.
<A NAME="409"></A><BR>The wealthy have no liberality.
<A NAME="410"></A><BR><BR>I, who had been cherished by the wealth of great men, considered 
<A NAME="411"></A>these words offensive and said: 'My good friend, the rich are the income 
<A NAME="412"></A>of the destitute and the hoarded store of recluses, the objects of pilgrims, 
<A NAME="413"></A>the refuge of travellers, the bearers of heavy loads for the relief of 
<A NAME="414"></A>others. They give repasts and partake of them to feed their dependants 
<A NAME="415"></A>and servants, the surplus of their liberalities being extended to widows, 
<A NAME="416"></A>aged persons, relatives and neighbours.'
<A NAME="417"></A><BR><BR>The rich must spend for pious uses, vows and 
<A NAME="418"></A>hospitality,
<A NAME="419"></A><BR>Tithes, offerings, manumissions, gifts and sacrifices.
<A NAME="420"></A><BR>How canst thou attain their power of doing good who art 
<A NAME="421"></A>able
<A NAME="422"></A><BR>To perform only the prayer-flections and these with a 
<A NAME="423"></A>hundred
<A NAME="424"></A><BR>distractions?
<A NAME="425"></A><BR><BR>If there be efficacy in the power to be liberal and in the ability 
<A NAME="426"></A>of performing religious duties, the rich can attain it better because they 
<A NAME="427"></A>possess money to give alms, their garments are pure, their reputation is 
<A NAME="428"></A>guarded, their hearts are at leisure. Inasmuch as the power of obedience 
<A NAME="429"></A>depends upon nice morsels and correct worship upon elegant clothes, it 
<A NAME="430"></A>is evident that hungry bowels have but little strength, an empty hand can 
<A NAME="431"></A>afford no liberality, shackled feet cannot walk, and no good can come from 
<A NAME="432"></A>a hungry belly.
<A NAME="433"></A><BR><BR>He sleeps troubled in the night
<A NAME="434"></A><BR>Who has no support for the morrow.
<A NAME="435"></A><BR>The ant collects in summer a subsistence
<A NAME="436"></A><BR>For spending the winter in ease.
<A NAME="437"></A><BR><BR>Freedom from care and destitution are not joined together and comfort 
<A NAME="438"></A>in poverty is an impossibility. A man who is rich is engaged in his evening 
<A NAME="439"></A>devotions whilst another who is poor is looking for his evening meal. How 
<A NAME="440"></A>can they resemble each other?
<A NAME="441"></A><BR><BR>He who possesses means is engaged in worship.
<A NAME="442"></A><BR>Whose means are scattered, his heart is distracted.
<A NAME="443"></A><BR><BR>The worship of those who are comfortable is more likely to meet 
<A NAME="444"></A>with acceptance, their minds being more attentive and not distracted or 
<A NAME="445"></A>scattered. Having a secure income, they may attend to devotion. The Arab 
<A NAME="446"></A>says: 'I take refuge with Allah against base poverty and neighbours whom 
<A NAME="447"></A>I do not love. There is also a tradition: Poverty is blackness of face 
<A NAME="448"></A>in both worlds.'
<A NAME="449"></A><BR><BR>He retorted by asking me whether I had heard the Prophet's saying: 
<A NAME="450"></A>Poverty is my glory. I replied: 'Hush! The prince of the world alluded 
<A NAME="451"></A>to the poverty of warriors in the battlefield of acquiescence and of submission 
<A NAME="452"></A>to the arrow of destiny; not to those who don the patched garb of righteousness 
<A NAME="453"></A>but sell the doles of food given them as alms.'
<A NAME="454"></A><BR><BR>O drum of high sound and nothing within,
<A NAME="455"></A><BR>What wilt thou do without means when the struggle 
<A NAME="456"></A>comes?
<A NAME="457"></A><BR>Turn away the face of greed from people if thou art a 
<A NAME="458"></A>man.
<A NAME="459"></A><BR>Trust not the rosary of one thousand beads in thy 
<A NAME="460"></A>hand.
<A NAME="461"></A><BR><BR>A dervish without divine knowledge rests not until his poverty, 
<A NAME="462"></A>culminates in unbelief; for poverty is almost infidelity, because a nude 
<A NAME="463"></A>person cannot be clothed without money nor a prisoner liberated. How can 
<A NAME="464"></A>the like of us attain their high position and how does the bestowing resemble 
<A NAME="465"></A>the receiving hand? Knowest thou not that God the most high and glorious 
<A NAME="466"></A>mentions in his revealed word the Pleasures of paradise-They shall have 
<A NAME="467"></A>a certain provision in paradise-to inform thee that those who are occupied 
<A NAME="468"></A>with cares for a subsistence are excluded from the felicity of piety and 
<A NAME="469"></A>that the realm of leisure is under the ring of the certain 
<A NAME="470"></A>provision.
<A NAME="471"></A><BR><BR>The thirsty look in their sleep
<A NAME="472"></A><BR>On the whole world as a spring of water.
<A NAME="473"></A><BR><BR>Wherever thou beholdest one who has experienced destitution and 
<A NAME="474"></A>tasted bitterness, throwing himself wickedly into fearful adventures and 
<A NAME="475"></A>not avoiding their consequences, he fears not the punishment of Yazed and 
<A NAME="476"></A>does not discriminate between what is licit or illicit.
<A NAME="477"></A><BR><BR>The dog whose head is touched by a clod of earth
<A NAME="478"></A><BR>Leaps for joy, imagining it to be a bone.
<A NAME="479"></A><BR>And when two men take a corpse on their shoulders,
<A NAME="480"></A><BR>A greedy fellow supposes it to be a table with food.
<A NAME="481"></A><BR><BR>But the possessor of wealth is regarded with a favourable eye by 
<A NAME="482"></A>the Almighty for the lawful acts he has done and preserved from the unlawful 
<A NAME="483"></A>acts he might commit. Although I have not fully explained this matter nor 
<A NAME="484"></A>adduced arguments, I rely on thy sense of justice to tell me whether thou 
<A NAME="485"></A>hast ever seen a mendicant with his hands tied up to his shoulders or a 
<A NAME="486"></A>poor fellow sitting in prison or a veil of innocence rent or a guilty hand 
<A NAME="487"></A>amputated, except in consequence of poverty? Lion-hearted men were on account 
<A NAME="488"></A>of their necessities captured in mines which they had dug to rob houses 
<A NAME="489"></A>and their heels were perforated. It is also possible that a dervish, impelled 
<A NAME="490"></A>by the cravings of his lust and unable to restrain it, may commit sin because 
<A NAME="491"></A>the stomach and the sexual organs are twins, that is to say, they are the 
<A NAME="492"></A>two children of one belly and as long as one of these is contented, the 
<A NAME="493"></A>other will likewise be satisfied. I heard that a dervish had been seen 
<A NAME="494"></A>committing a wicked act with a youth, and although he had been put to shame, 
<A NAME="495"></A>he was also in danger of being stoned. He said: 'O Musalmans, I have no 
<A NAME="496"></A>power to marry a wife and no patience to restrain myself. What am I to 
<A NAME="497"></A>do? There is no monasticism in Islam." Among the number of causes producing 
<A NAME="498"></A>internal tranquility and comfort in wealthy people, the fact may be reckoned 
<A NAME="499"></A>that they take every night a sweetheart in their arms and may every day 
<A NAME="500"></A>contemplate a youth whose brightness excels that of the shining morn and 
<A NAME="501"></A>causes the feet of walking cypresses to conceal themselves 
<A NAME="502"></A>abashed.
<A NAME="503"></A><BR><BR>Plunging the fist into the blood of beloved 
<A NAME="504"></A>persons,
<A NAME="505"></A><BR>Dying the finger-tips with the colour of the jujube-fruit.
<A NAME="506"></A><BR><BR>It is impossible that with his beauteous stature he should prowl 
<A NAME="507"></A>around prohibited things or entertain intentions of ruin to 
<A NAME="508"></A>himself.
<A NAME="509"></A><BR><BR>How could he who took as booty a Huri of paradise
<A NAME="510"></A><BR>Take any notice of the benes of Yaghma?
<A NAME="511"></A><BR><BR>Who has before him fresh dates which he loves
<A NAME="512"></A><BR>Has no need to throw stones on clusters upon trees.
<A NAME="513"></A><BR><BR>Mostly empty handed persons pollute the skirt of modesty by transgression, 
<A NAME="514"></A>and those who are hungry steal bread.
<A NAME="515"></A><BR><BR>When a ferocious dog has found meat
<A NAME="516"></A><BR>He asks not whether it is of the camel of Saleh or the ass 
<A NAME="517"></A>of
<A NAME="518"></A><BR>Dujjal.
<A NAME="519"></A><BR><BR>What a number of modest women have on account of poverty fallen 
<A NAME="520"></A>into complete profligacy, throwing away their precious reputation to the 
<A NAME="521"></A>wind of dishonour!
<A NAME="522"></A><BR><BR>With hunger the power of abstinence cannot abide.
<A NAME="523"></A><BR>Poverty snatches the reins from the hands of piety.
<A NAME="524"></A><BR><BR>Whilst I was uttering these words, the dervish lost the bridle 
<A NAME="525"></A>of patience from his hands, drew forth the sword of his tongue, caused 
<A NAME="526"></A>the steed of eloquence to caper in the plain of reproach and said: 'Thou 
<A NAME="527"></A>hast been so profuse in this panegyric of wealthy men and hast talked so 
<A NAME="528"></A>much nonsense that they might be supposed to be the antidote to poverty 
<A NAME="529"></A>or the key to the storehouse of provisions; whereas they are a handful 
<A NAME="530"></A>of proud, arrogant, conceited and abominable fellows intent upon accumulating 
<A NAME="531"></A>property and money and so thirsting for dignity and abundance, that they 
<A NAME="532"></A>do not speak to poor people except with insolence, and look upon them with 
<A NAME="533"></A>contempt. They consider scholars to be mendicants and insult poor men on 
<A NAME="534"></A>account of the wealth which they themselves possess and the glory of dignity 
<A NAME="535"></A>which they imagine is inherent in them. They sit in the highest places 
<A NAME="536"></A>and believe they are better than anyone else. They never show kindness 
<A NAME="537"></A>to anybody and are ignorant of the maxim of sages that he who is inferior 
<A NAME="538"></A>to others in piety but superior in riches is outwardly powerful but in 
<A NAME="539"></A>reality a destitute man.
<A NAME="540"></A><BR><BR>If a wretch on account of his wealth is proud to a 
<A NAME="541"></A>sage
<A NAME="542"></A><BR>Consider him to be the podex of an ass, though he may be a 
<A NAME="543"></A>perfumed
<A NAME="544"></A><BR>ox.'
<A NAME="545"></A><BR><BR>I said: 'Do not think it allowable to insult them for they are 
<A NAME="546"></A>possessors of generosity.' He rejoined: 'Thou art mistaken. They are slaves 
<A NAME="547"></A>of money. Of what use is it that they are like bulky clouds and rain not, 
<A NAME="548"></A>like the fountain of light, the sun, and shine upon no one? They are mounted 
<A NAME="549"></A>on the steed of ability but do not use it; they would not stir a step for 
<A NAME="550"></A>God's sake nor spend one dirhem without imposing obligation and insult. 
<A NAME="551"></A>They accumulate property with difficulty, guard it with meanness and abandon 
<A NAME="552"></A>it with reluctance, according to the saying of illustrious men that the 
<A NAME="553"></A>silver of an avaricious man will come up from the ground when he goes into 
<A NAME="554"></A>the ground.
<A NAME="555"></A><BR><BR>One man gathers wealth with trouble and labour
<A NAME="556"></A><BR>And if another comes, he takes it without either.'
<A NAME="557"></A><BR><BR>I retorted: 'Thou hast not become aware of the parsimony of wealthy 
<A NAME="558"></A>men except by reason of mendicancy or else, to him who has laid aside covetousness, 
<A NAME="559"></A>a liberal and an avaricious man would appear to be the same. The touchstone 
<A NAME="560"></A>knows what gold is and the beggar knows him who is stingy.' He rejoined: 
<A NAME="561"></A>'I am speaking from experience when I say that they station rude and insolent 
<A NAME="562"></A>men at their gates to keep off worthy persons, to place violent hands upon 
<A NAME="563"></A>men of piety and discretion, saying: "Nobody is here", and verily they 
<A NAME="564"></A>have spoken the truth.'
<A NAME="565"></A><BR><BR>Of him who has no sense, intention, plan or 
<A NAME="566"></A>opinion,
<A NAME="567"></A><BR>The gatekeeper has beautifully said: 'No one is in the 
<A NAME="568"></A>house.'
<A NAME="569"></A><BR><BR>I said this is excusable because they are teased out of their lives 
<A NAME="570"></A>by people expecting favours and driven to lamentation by petitions of mendicants; 
<A NAME="571"></A>it being according to common sense an impossibility to satisfy beggars 
<A NAME="572"></A>even if the sand of the desert were to be transmuted into 
<A NAME="573"></A>pearls.
<A NAME="574"></A><BR><BR>The eye of greediness, the wealthy of the world
<A NAME="575"></A><BR>Can no more fill than dew can replenish a well.
<A NAME="576"></A><BR><BR>Hatim Tai dwelt in the desert; had he been in a town he would have 
<A NAME="577"></A>been helpless against the assaults of beggars and they would have torn 
<A NAME="578"></A>to pieces his upper garments as it is recorded in the 
<A NAME="579"></A>Tayibat:
<A NAME="580"></A><BR><BR>Look not at me that others may not conceive 
<A NAME="581"></A>hopes
<A NAME="582"></A><BR>Because there is no reward to be got from beggars.
<A NAME="583"></A><BR><BR>He said: 'No. I take pity on their state.' I replied: 'No. Thou 
<A NAME="584"></A>enviest them their wealth.' We were thus contending with each other, every 
<A NAME="585"></A>pawn he put forward I endeavoured to repel, and every time he announced 
<A NAME="586"></A>check to my king, I covered him with my queen until he had gambled away 
<A NAME="587"></A>all his ready cash and had shot off all the arrows of his quiver in 
<A NAME="588"></A>arguing.
<A NAME="589"></A><BR><BR>Have a care; do not throw away the shield when attacked by an 
<A NAME="590"></A>orator
<A NAME="591"></A><BR>Who has nothing except borrowed eloquence to show,
<A NAME="592"></A><BR>Practise thou religion and marifet because a Suja-speaking 
<A NAME="593"></A>orator
<A NAME="594"></A><BR>Displays weapons at the gate but no one is in the 
<A NAME="595"></A>fort.
<A NAME="596"></A><BR><BR>At last no arguments remained to him and, having been defeated, 
<A NAME="597"></A>he commenced to speak nonsense as is the custom of ignorant men who, when 
<A NAME="598"></A>they can no more address proofs against their opponent, shake the chain 
<A NAME="599"></A>of enmity like the idol-carver Azer who being unable to overcome his son 
<A NAME="600"></A>in argument began to quarrel with him saying if thou forbearest not I will 
<A NAME="601"></A>surely stone thee. The man insulted me. I spoke harshly to him. He tore 
<A NAME="602"></A>my collar and I caught hold of his chin-case.
<A NAME="603"></A><BR><BR>He falling upon me and I on him,
<A NAME="604"></A><BR>Crowds running after us and laughing,
<A NAME="605"></A><BR>The finger of astonishment of a world
<A NAME="606"></A><BR>On the teeth; from what was said and heard by us.
<A NAME="607"></A><BR><BR>In short we carried our dispute to the qazi and agreed to abide 
<A NAME="608"></A>by a just decision of the judge of Musalmans, who would investigate the 
<A NAME="609"></A>affair and tell the difference between the rich and the poor. When the 
<A NAME="610"></A>qazi had seen our state and heard our logic, he plunged his head into his 
<A NAME="611"></A>collar and after meditating for a while spoke as follows: 'O thou, who 
<A NAME="612"></A>hast lauded the wealthy and hast indulged in violent language towards dervishes, 
<A NAME="613"></A>thou art to know that wherever a rose exists, there also thorns occur; 
<A NAME="614"></A>that wine is followed by intoxication, that a treasure is guarded by a 
<A NAME="615"></A>serpent, and that wherever royal pearls are found, men-devouring sharks 
<A NAME="616"></A>must also be. The sting of death is the sequel of the delights of life 
<A NAME="617"></A>and a cunning demon bars the enjoyment of paradise.
<A NAME="618"></A><BR><BR>'What will the violence of a foe do if it cannot touch the seeker 
<A NAME="619"></A>of
<A NAME="620"></A><BR>the Friend?
<A NAME="621"></A><BR>Treasure, serpent; rose, thorn; grief and pleasure are all 
<A NAME="622"></A>linked
<A NAME="623"></A><BR>together.
<A NAME="624"></A><BR><BR>'Perceivest thou not that in a garden there are musk-willows as 
<A NAME="625"></A>well as withered sticks? And likewise in the crowd of the rich there are 
<A NAME="626"></A>grateful and impious men, as also in the circle of dervishes some are forbearing 
<A NAME="627"></A>and some are impatient.
<A NAME="628"></A><BR><BR>'If every drop of dew were to become a pearl
<A NAME="629"></A><BR>The bazar would be full of them as of ass-shells.
<A NAME="630"></A><BR><BR>'Those near to the presence of the most high and glorious are rich 
<A NAME="631"></A>men with the disposition of dervishes and dervishes with the inclination 
<A NAME="632"></A>of the rich. The greatest of rich men is he who sympathizes with dervishes 
<A NAME="633"></A>and the best of dervishes is he who looks but little towards rich men. 
<A NAME="634"></A>Who trusts in Allah, he will be his sufficient support.'
<A NAME="635"></A><BR><BR>After this the qazi turned the face of reproof from me to the dervish 
<A NAME="636"></A>and said: 'O thou who hast alleged that the wealthy are engaged in wickedness 
<A NAME="637"></A>and intoxicated with pleasure, some certainly are of the kind thou hast 
<A NAME="638"></A>described; of defective aspirations, and ungrateful for benefits received. 
<A NAME="639"></A>Sometimes they accumulate and put by, eat and give not; if for instance 
<A NAME="640"></A>the rain were to fail or a deluge were to distress the world, they, trusting 
<A NAME="641"></A>in their own power, would not care for the misery of dervishes, would not 
<A NAME="642"></A>fear God and would say:
<A NAME="643"></A><BR><BR>If another perishes for want of food
<A NAME="644"></A><BR>I have some; what cares a duck for the deluge?
<A NAME="645"></A><BR><BR>The women riding on camels in their howdahs
<A NAME="646"></A><BR>Take no notice of him who sinks in the sana.
<A NAME="647"></A><BR><BR>The base when they have saved their own blankets
<A NAME="648"></A><BR>Say: What boots it if all mankind perishes?
<A NAME="649"></A><BR><BR>'There are people of the kind thou hast heard of, and other persons 
<A NAME="650"></A>who keep the table of beneficence spread out, the hand of liberality open, 
<A NAME="651"></A>seeking a good name and pardon from God. They are the possessors of this 
<A NAME="652"></A>world and of the next, like the slaves of His Majesty Padshah of the world 
<A NAME="653"></A>who is aided by devine grace, conqueror, possessor of authority among nations, 
<A NAME="654"></A>defender of the frontiers of Islam, heir of the realm of Solomon, the most 
<A NAME="655"></A>righteous of the kings of the period, Muzaffar-ud-dunia wa uddin Atabek 
<A NAME="656"></A>Abu Bekr Ben Sa'd Ben Zanki, may Allah prolong his days and aid his 
<A NAME="657"></A>banners.
<A NAME="658"></A><BR><BR>'A father never shows the kindness to his son
<A NAME="659"></A><BR>Which the hand of thy liberality has bestowed on 
<A NAME="660"></A>mankind.
<A NAME="661"></A><BR>God desired to vouchsafe a blessing to the world
<A NAME="662"></A><BR>And in his mercy made thee padshah of the world.'
<A NAME="663"></A><BR><BR>When the qazi had thus far protracted his remarks and had caused 
<A NAME="664"></A>the horse of his eloquence to roam beyond the limits of our expectation, 
<A NAME="665"></A>we submitted to his judicial decision, condoned to each other what had 
<A NAME="666"></A>passed between us, took the path of reconciliation, placed our heads on 
<A NAME="667"></A>each other's feet by way of apology, kissed each other's head and face, 
<A NAME="668"></A>terminating the discussion with the following two distichs:
<A NAME="669"></A><BR><BR>Complain not of the turning of the spheres, O 
<A NAME="670"></A>dervish,
<A NAME="671"></A><BR>Because thou wilt be luckless if thou diest in this frame of 
<A NAME="672"></A>mind.
<A NAME="673"></A><BR>O wealthy man, since thy heart and hand are successful
<A NAME="674"></A><BR>Eat and be liberal for thou hast conquered this world and the 
<A NAME="675"></A>next.
