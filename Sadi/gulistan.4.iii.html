<A NAME="10"></A><B>On the Excellence of Contentment</B>
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="11"></A>Story 1
<A NAME="12"></A><BR><BR>A Maghrabi supplicant said in Aleppo in the row of linen-drapers: 
<A NAME="13"></A>'Lords of wealth, if you were just and we contented, the trade of begging 
<A NAME="14"></A>would vanish from the world.'
<A NAME="15"></A><BR><BR>O contentment, make me rich
<A NAME="16"></A><BR>For besides thee no other wealth exists.
<A NAME="17"></A><BR>Loqman selected the corner of patience.
<A NAME="18"></A><BR>Who has no patience has no wisdom.
<A NAME="19"></A><BR><BR>Story 2
<A NAME="20"></A><BR><BR>Two sons of amirs were in Egypt, the one acquiring science, the 
<A NAME="21"></A>other accumulating wealth, till the former became the ullemma of the period 
<A NAME="22"></A>and the other the prince of Egypt; whereon the rich man looked with contempt 
<A NAME="23"></A>upon the faqih and said: 'I have reached the sultanate whilst thou hast 
<A NAME="24"></A>remained in poverty as before.' He replied: 'O brother, I am bound to be 
<A NAME="25"></A>grateful to the most high Creator for having obtained the inheritance of 
<A NAME="26"></A>prophets whilst thou hast attained the inheritance of Pharaoh and of Haman, 
<A NAME="27"></A>namely the kingdom of Egypt.'
<A NAME="28"></A><BR><BR>I am that ant which is trodden under foot
<A NAME="29"></A><BR>Not that wasp, the pain of whose sting causes lament.
<A NAME="30"></A><BR>How shall I give due thanks for the blessing
<A NAME="31"></A><BR>That I do not possess the strength of injuring mankind?
<A NAME="32"></A><BR><BR>Story 3
<A NAME="33"></A><BR><BR>I heard that a dervish, burning in the fire of poverty and sewing 
<A NAME="34"></A>patch upon patch, said to comfort his mind:
<A NAME="35"></A><BR><BR>'We are contented with dry bread and a patched 
<A NAME="36"></A>robe
<A NAME="37"></A><BR>For it is easier to bear the load of one's own trouble
<A NAME="38"></A><BR>than that of thanks to others.'
<A NAME="39"></A><BR><BR>Someone said to him: 'Why sittest thou? A certain man in this town 
<A NAME="40"></A>possesses a benevolent nature, is liberal to all, has girded his loins 
<A NAME="41"></A>to serve the pious and is ready to comfort every heart. If he becomes aware 
<A NAME="42"></A>of thy case, he will consider it an obligation to comfort the mind of a 
<A NAME="43"></A>worthy person.' He replied: 'Hush! It is better to die of inanition than 
<A NAME="44"></A>to plead for one's necessities before any man.'
<A NAME="45"></A><BR><BR>It is better to patch clothes and sit in the corner of 
<A NAME="46"></A>patience
<A NAME="47"></A><BR>Than to write petitions for robes to gentlemen.
<A NAME="48"></A><BR>Verily it is equal to the punishment of hell
<A NAME="49"></A><BR>To go to paradise as a flunkey to one's neighbour.
<A NAME="50"></A><BR><BR>Story 4
<A NAME="51"></A><BR><BR>One of the kings of Persia had sent an able physician to wait upon 
<A NAME="52"></A>the Mustafa, the benediction of Allah and peace be on him; and he remained 
<A NAME="53"></A>for some years in the Arab country without anyone coming to him to make 
<A NAME="54"></A>a trial of his ability or desiring to be treated by him. He went to the 
<A NAME="55"></A>Prophet, salutation to him, and complained that although he had been sent 
<A NAME="56"></A>to treat the companions, none of them had up to this time taken notice 
<A NAME="57"></A>of him or required the services incumbent upon him. The Apostle, salutation 
<A NAME="58"></A>to him, replied: 'It is a law with these people not to eat until appetite 
<A NAME="59"></A>overpowers them and when some of it yet remains they withdraw their hands 
<A NAME="60"></A>from food.' The doctor said: 'This is the cause of health', and kissing 
<A NAME="61"></A>the earth of service departed.
<A NAME="62"></A><BR><BR>The sage begins to speak
<A NAME="63"></A><BR>Or points his fingers to the dish
<A NAME="64"></A><BR>When silence would be dangerous
<A NAME="65"></A><BR>Or abstinance would bring on death.
<A NAME="66"></A><BR>No doubt his wisdom is in speaking
<A NAME="67"></A><BR>And his eating bears the fruit of health.
<A NAME="68"></A><BR><BR>Story 5
<A NAME="69"></A><BR><BR>A man often made vows of repentance but broke them again till one 
<A NAME="70"></A>of the sheikhs said to him: 'I think thou art in the habit of eating a 
<A NAME="71"></A>great deal and that thy power of restraining appetite is more slender than 
<A NAME="72"></A>a hair, whilst an appetite such as thou nourishest would rupture a chain 
<A NAME="73"></A>and a day may come when it will tear thee up.'
<A NAME="74"></A><BR><BR>A man brought up a wolf's whelp.
<A NAME="75"></A><BR>When it was brought up it tore him up.
<A NAME="76"></A><BR><BR>Story 6
<A NAME="77"></A><BR><BR>It is narrated in the life of Ardeshir Babekan that he asked an 
<A NAME="78"></A>Arab physician how much food he must consume daily. He replied: 'The weight 
<A NAME="79"></A>of one hundred dirhems will be enough.' The king queried: 'What strength 
<A NAME="80"></A>will this quantity give me?' He replied: 'This quantity will carry thee, 
<A NAME="81"></A>and whatever is more than that, thou wilt be the carrier of 
<A NAME="82"></A>it.'
<A NAME="83"></A><BR><BR>Eating is for living and praying.
<A NAME="84"></A><BR>Thou thinkest living is for eating.
<A NAME="85"></A><BR><BR>Story 7
<A NAME="86"></A><BR><BR>Two Khorasani dervishes travelled together. One of them, being 
<A NAME="87"></A>weak, broke his fast every second night whilst the other who was strong 
<A NAME="88"></A>consumed every day three meals. It happened that they were captured at 
<A NAME="89"></A>the gate of a town on suspicion of being spies; whereon each of them was 
<A NAME="90"></A>confined in a closet and the aperture of it walled up with mud bricks. 
<A NAME="91"></A>After two weeks it became known that they were guiltless. Accordingly the 
<A NAME="92"></A>doors were opened and the strong man was found to be dead whilst the weak 
<A NAME="93"></A>fellow had remained alive. The people were astonished but a sage averred 
<A NAME="94"></A>that the contrary would have been astonishing because one of them having 
<A NAME="95"></A>been voracious possessed no strength to suffer hunger and perished whilst 
<A NAME="96"></A>the other who was abstemious merely persevered in his habit and remained 
<A NAME="97"></A>safe.
<A NAME="98"></A><BR><BR>When eating little has become the nature of a 
<A NAME="99"></A>man
<A NAME="100"></A><BR>He takes it easy when a calamity befalls him
<A NAME="101"></A><BR>But when the body becomes strong in affluence
<A NAME="102"></A><BR>He will die when a hardship overtakes him.
<A NAME="103"></A><BR>Story 8
<A NAME="104"></A><BR><BR>One of the philosophers forbade his son to eat much because repletion 
<A NAME="105"></A>keeps people ailing. The boy replied: 'O father, it is hunger that kills. 
<A NAME="106"></A>Hast thou not heard of the maxim of the ingenious that it is better to 
<A NAME="107"></A>die satiated than to bear hunger?' He rejoined: 'Be moderate. Eat and drink 
<A NAME="108"></A>but not to excess.'
<A NAME="109"></A><BR><BR>Eat not so much that it comes up to thy mouth
<A NAME="110"></A><BR>Nor so little that from weakness thy soul comes 
<A NAME="111"></A>up.
<A NAME="112"></A><BR><BR>Although maintenance of life depends upon food
<A NAME="113"></A><BR>Victuals bring on disease when eaten to excess.
<A NAME="114"></A><BR>If thou eatest rose-confectionery without appetite it injures 
<A NAME="115"></A>thee
<A NAME="116"></A><BR>But eating dry bread after a long fast is like rose-preserve.
<A NAME="117"></A><BR><BR>Story 9
<A NAME="118"></A><BR><BR>A sick man having been asked what his heart desired replied: 'That 
<A NAME="119"></A>it may not desire anything.'
<A NAME="120"></A><BR><BR>When the bowels are full and the belly pains
<A NAME="121"></A><BR>There is no use in all other things being right.
<A NAME="122"></A><BR><BR>Story 10
<A NAME="123"></A><BR><BR>A grain dealer to whom Sufis were owing some money asked them for 
<A NAME="124"></A>it every day in the town of Waset and used harsh language towards them. 
<A NAME="125"></A>The companions had become weary of his reproaches but had no other remedy 
<A NAME="126"></A>than to bear them; and one of them who was a pious man remarked: 'It is 
<A NAME="127"></A>more easy to pacify a hungry stomach with promises of food than a grain 
<A NAME="128"></A>dealer with promises of money.'
<A NAME="129"></A><BR><BR>It is preferable to be without the bounty of a 
<A NAME="130"></A>gentleman
<A NAME="131"></A><BR>Than to bear the insults of the gate-keepers.
<A NAME="132"></A><BR>It is better to die wishing for meat
<A NAME="133"></A><BR>Than to endure the expostulations of butchers.
<A NAME="134"></A><BR><BR>Story 11
<A NAME="135"></A><BR><BR>A brave warrior who had received a dreadful wound in the Tatar 
<A NAME="136"></A>war was informed that a certain merchant possessed a medicine which he 
<A NAME="137"></A>would probably not refuse to give if asked for; but it is related that 
<A NAME="138"></A>the said merchant was also well known for his avarice.
<A NAME="139"></A><BR><BR>If instead of bread he had the sun in his table-cloth
<A NAME="140"></A><BR>No one could see daylight till the day of resurrection.
<A NAME="141"></A><BR><BR>The warrior replied: 'If I ask for the medicine he will either 
<A NAME="142"></A>give it or refuse it and if he gives it maybe it will profit me, and maybe 
<A NAME="143"></A>not. At any rate the inconvenience of asking it from him is a lethal 
<A NAME="144"></A>poison.'
<A NAME="145"></A><BR><BR>Whatever thou obtainest by entreaties from base 
<A NAME="146"></A>men
<A NAME="147"></A><BR>Will profit thy body but injure thy soul.
<A NAME="148"></A><BR><BR>And philosophers have said: 'If for instance the water of life 
<A NAME="149"></A>were to be exchanged for a good reputation, no wise man would purchase 
<A NAME="150"></A>it because it is preferable to die with honour than to live in 
<A NAME="151"></A>disgrace.'
<A NAME="152"></A><BR><BR>To eat coloquinth from the hand of a sweet-tempered 
<A NAME="153"></A>man
<A NAME="154"></A><BR>Is better than confectionery from the hand of an 
<A NAME="155"></A>ill-humoured
<A NAME="156"></A><BR>fellow.
<A NAME="157"></A><BR><BR>Story 12
<A NAME="158"></A><BR><BR>One of the ullemma had many eaters to provide for and only a slender 
<A NAME="159"></A>income. This fact he communicated to a great man of whose character he 
<A NAME="160"></A>entertained a very favourable opinion but his expectations were disappointed 
<A NAME="161"></A>because the man made a wry face and averred that according to his opinion 
<A NAME="162"></A>applications from respectable persons for aid are unbecoming.
<A NAME="163"></A><BR><BR>With a face made sad by misfortune, to a dear 
<A NAME="164"></A>friend
<A NAME="165"></A><BR>Do not go because thou wilt embitter his life also.
<A NAME="166"></A><BR>For the needful for which thou appliest, go with a fresh 
<A NAME="167"></A>and
<A NAME="168"></A><BR>smiling face.
<A NAME="169"></A><BR>The man of joyful countenance will not be unsuccessful in 
<A NAME="170"></A>his
<A NAME="171"></A><BR>affairs.
<A NAME="172"></A><BR><BR>It is related that the great man augmented his stipend a little 
<A NAME="173"></A>but considerably diminished his familiarity towards him and when he perceived 
<A NAME="174"></A>after some days that it was not as usual, he recited:
<A NAME="175"></A><BR><BR>'Evil is the food which the time of degradation 
<A NAME="176"></A>acquires.
<A NAME="177"></A><BR>The kettle is indeed placed but the dignity is lowered.'
<A NAME="178"></A><BR><BR>He increased my bread but diminished my honour.
<A NAME="179"></A><BR>Poverty is better than the degradation of asking.
<A NAME="180"></A><BR><BR>Story 13
<A NAME="181"></A><BR><BR>A dervish wanted something and a man told him that a certain individual 
<A NAME="182"></A>possessed untold wealth who, if he were made aware of his want, would not 
<A NAME="183"></A>consider it proper to fail in supplying it forthwith. The dervish answering 
<A NAME="184"></A>that he had no acquaintance with him, the man proposed to show him the 
<A NAME="185"></A>house and when the dervish entered he caught sight of a person with hanging 
<A NAME="186"></A>lips and sitting morosely. He returned immediately and being asked what 
<A NAME="187"></A>he had done replied: 'I excused him from making me a present when I saw 
<A NAME="188"></A>his face.'
<A NAME="189"></A><BR><BR>Carry not thy necessity to a sour-faced fellow
<A NAME="190"></A><BR>Because his ill-humour will crush thy hopes.
<A NAME="191"></A><BR>If thou confidest thy heart's grief, tell it to 
<A NAME="192"></A>one
<A NAME="193"></A><BR>Whose face will comfort thee like ready cash.
<A NAME="194"></A><BR><BR>Story 14
<A NAME="195"></A><BR><BR>A year of dearth set in at Alexandria so that even a dervish lost 
<A NAME="196"></A>the reins of patience from his hands, the pearls of heaven were withheld 
<A NAME="197"></A>from the earth and the lamentations of mankind ascended to the 
<A NAME="198"></A>firmament.
<A NAME="199"></A><BR><BR>There was no wild beast, fowl, fish or ant
<A NAME="200"></A><BR>Whose wailings prompted by distress had not reached the 
<A NAME="201"></A>sky.
<A NAME="202"></A><BR>For a wonder the heart-smoke of the people did not 
<A NAME="203"></A>condense
<A NAME="204"></A><BR>To form clouds and the torrents of their tears rain.
<A NAME="205"></A><BR><BR>In such a year there was an hermaphrodite. I owe it to my friends 
<A NAME="206"></A>not to describe him because it would be an abandonment of good manners, 
<A NAME="207"></A>especially in the presence of great men. On the other hand, it would likewise 
<A NAME="208"></A>be improper and in the way of negligence not to mention anything about 
<A NAME="209"></A>him because certain people would impute it to the ignorance of the narrator. 
<A NAME="210"></A>Accordingly I shall briefly describe him in the following two distichs 
<A NAME="211"></A>because a little indicates much and a handful is a sample of a donkey 
<A NAME="212"></A>load.
<A NAME="213"></A><BR><BR>If a Tatar slays that hermaphrodite
<A NAME="214"></A><BR>The Tatar must not be slain in return.
<A NAME="215"></A><BR><BR>How long will he be like the bridge of Baghdad
<A NAME="216"></A><BR>With water flowing beneath and men on the back?
<A NAME="217"></A><BR><BR>Such a man, a portion of whose eulogy thou hast now heard, possessed 
<A NAME="218"></A>in that year boundless wealth, bestowed silver and gold upon the needy 
<A NAME="219"></A>and laid out tables for travellers. A company of dervishes who were by 
<A NAME="220"></A>the presence of distress on the point of starvation were inclined to accept 
<A NAME="221"></A>of his hospitality and consulted me on the subject but I struck my head 
<A NAME="222"></A>back from assenting and replied:
<A NAME="223"></A><BR><BR>A lion does not eat the half of which a dog 
<A NAME="224"></A>consumed
<A NAME="225"></A><BR>Although he may die of hunger in his lair.
<A NAME="226"></A><BR>Though getting rich in wealth and property like 
<A NAME="227"></A>Feridun
<A NAME="228"></A><BR>A worthless man is to be considered of no account.
<A NAME="229"></A><BR>Story 15
<A NAME="230"></A><BR><BR>Hatim Tai, having been asked whether he had seen in the world anyone 
<A NAME="231"></A>of more exalted sentiments than himself, replied: 'Yes, one day I slaughtered 
<A NAME="232"></A>forty camels to entertain Arab amirs. I had occasion to go out on some 
<A NAME="233"></A>business into a corner of the desert, where I noticed a gatherer of briars, 
<A NAME="234"></A>who had accumulated a hillock of thistles, and I asked him why he had not 
<A NAME="235"></A>become a guest of Hatim since many people had come round to his banquet 
<A NAME="236"></A>but he replied:
<A NAME="237"></A><BR><BR>"Who eats bread by the work of his own hand
<A NAME="238"></A><BR>Will not bear to be obliged to Hatim Tai."
<A NAME="239"></A><BR><BR>Then I saw that his sentiments were more exalted than 
<A NAME="240"></A>mine.'
<A NAME="241"></A><BR><BR>Story 16
<A NAME="242"></A><BR><BR>Moses, to whom be salutation, beheld a dervish who had on account 
<A NAME="243"></A>of his nudity concealed himself in the sand exclaiming: 'O Moses, utter 
<A NAME="244"></A>a supplication to God the most high to give me an allowance because I am, 
<A NAME="245"></A>on account of my distress, on the point of starvation.' Moses accordingly 
<A NAME="246"></A>prayed and departed but returning a few days afterwards he saw that the 
<A NAME="247"></A>dervish was a prisoner and surrounded by a crowd of people. On asking for 
<A NAME="248"></A>the reason he was informed that the dervish had drunk wine, quarrelled, 
<A NAME="249"></A>slain a man and was to be executed in retaliation.
<A NAME="250"></A><BR><BR>If the humble cat possessed wings
<A NAME="251"></A><BR>He would rob the world of every sparrow-egg.
<A NAME="252"></A><BR>It may happen that when a weak man obtains power
<A NAME="253"></A><BR>He arises and twists the hands of the weak.
<A NAME="254"></A><BR><BR>And if Allah were to bestow abundance upon his servants, they would 
<A NAME="255"></A>certainly rebel upon earth.
<A NAME="256"></A><BR><BR>What has made thee wade into danger, O fool,
<A NAME="257"></A><BR>Till thou hast perished. Would that the ant had not been able 
<A NAME="258"></A>to
<A NAME="259"></A><BR>fly!
<A NAME="260"></A><BR><BR>When a base fellow obtains dignity, silver and 
<A NAME="261"></A>gold,
<A NAME="262"></A><BR>His head necessarily demands to be knocked.
<A NAME="263"></A><BR>Was not after all this maxim uttered by a sage?
<A NAME="264"></A><BR>'That ant is the best which possesses no wings.'
<A NAME="265"></A><BR><BR>The heavenly father has plenty of honey but the son 
<A NAME="266"></A>has
<A NAME="267"></A><BR>a hot disease.
<A NAME="268"></A><BR><BR>He who does not make thee rich
<A NAME="269"></A><BR>Knows better what is good for thee than thyself.
<A NAME="270"></A><BR><BR>Story 17
<A NAME="271"></A><BR><BR>I noticed an Arab of the desert sitting in a company jewellers 
<A NAME="272"></A>at Bosrah and narrating stories to them. He said: 'I had once lost my road 
<A NAME="273"></A>in the desert and consumed all my provisions. I considered that I must 
<A NAME="274"></A>perish when I suddenly caught sight of a bag full of pearls and I shall 
<A NAME="275"></A>never forget the joy and ecstasy I felt on thinking they might be parched 
<A NAME="276"></A>grain nor the bitterness and despair when I discovered them to be 
<A NAME="277"></A>pearls.'
<A NAME="278"></A><BR><BR>In a dry desert and among moving sand
<A NAME="279"></A><BR>It is the same to a thirsty man whether he has pearls or shells 
<A NAME="280"></A>in
<A NAME="281"></A><BR>his mouth.
<A NAME="282"></A><BR>When a man has no provisions and his strength is 
<A NAME="283"></A>exhausted
<A NAME="284"></A><BR>It matters not whether his girdle is adorned with pearls 
<A NAME="285"></A>or
<A NAME="286"></A><BR>potsherds.
<A NAME="287"></A><BR><BR>Story 18
<A NAME="288"></A><BR><BR>An Arab suffering in the desert from extreme thirst 
<A NAME="289"></A>recited:
<A NAME="290"></A><BR><BR>'Would that before my death
<A NAME="291"></A><BR>I could one day enjoy my wish
<A NAME="292"></A><BR>That a river's waves might strike my knee
<A NAME="293"></A><BR>And I might fill my water-bag.'
<A NAME="294"></A><BR><BR>In the same manner another traveller lost himself in an extensive 
<A NAME="295"></A>region having neither any strength nor food left but he possessed some 
<A NAME="296"></A>money and roamed about and the road leading him nowhere he perished from 
<A NAME="297"></A>exhaustion. Some people afterwards discovered his corpse with the money 
<A NAME="298"></A>in front of it and the following written on the ground:
<A NAME="299"></A><BR><BR>If possessed of all the Ja'feri gold,
<A NAME="300"></A><BR>It will avail nothing to a hungry man.
<A NAME="301"></A><BR>To a poor man burnt in the desert
<A NAME="302"></A><BR>Boiled turnips are more valuable than pure silver.
<A NAME="303"></A><BR>Story 19
<A NAME="304"></A><BR><BR>I never lamented about the vicissitudes of time or complained of 
<A NAME="305"></A>the turns of fortune except on the occasion when I was barefooted and unable 
<A NAME="306"></A>to procure slippers. But when I entered the great mosque of Kufah with 
<A NAME="307"></A>a sore heart and beheld a man without feet I offered thanks to the bounty 
<A NAME="308"></A>of God, consoled myself for my want of shoes and recited:
<A NAME="309"></A><BR><BR>'A roast fowl is to the sight of a satiated 
<A NAME="310"></A>man
<A NAME="311"></A><BR>Less valuable than a blade of fresh grass on the 
<A NAME="312"></A>table
<A NAME="313"></A><BR>And to him who has no means nor power
<A NAME="314"></A><BR>A burnt turnip is a roasted fowl.'
<A NAME="315"></A><BR><BR>Story 20
<A NAME="316"></A><BR><BR>A king with some of his courtiers had during a hunting party and 
<A NAME="317"></A>in the winter season strayed far from inhabited places but when the night 
<A NAME="318"></A>set in he perceived the house of a dehqan and said: 'We shall spend the 
<A NAME="319"></A>night there to avoid the injury of the cold.' One of the veziers, however, 
<A NAME="320"></A>objected alleging that it was unworthy of the high dignity of a padshah 
<A NAME="321"></A>to take refuge in the house of a dehqan and that it would be best to pitch 
<A NAME="322"></A>tents and to light fires on the spot. The dehqan who had become aware of 
<A NAME="323"></A>what was taking place prepared some food he had ready in his house, offered 
<A NAME="324"></A>it, kissed the ground of service and said: 'The high dignity of the sultan 
<A NAME="325"></A>would not have been so much lowered, but the courtiers did not wish the 
<A NAME="326"></A>dignity of the dehqan to become high.' The king who was pleased with these 
<A NAME="327"></A>words moved for the night into the man's house and bestowed a dress of 
<A NAME="328"></A>honour upon him the next morning. When he accompanied the king a few paces 
<A NAME="329"></A>at the departure he was heard to say:
<A NAME="330"></A><BR><BR>'Nothing was lost of the sultan's power and 
<A NAME="331"></A>pomp
<A NAME="332"></A><BR>By accepting the hospitality of a dehqan,
<A NAME="333"></A><BR>But the corner of the dehqan's cap reached the sun
<A NAME="334"></A><BR>When a sultan such as thou overshadowed his head.'
<A NAME="335"></A><BR><BR>Story 21
<A NAME="336"></A><BR><BR>It is related that a sultan thus addressed a miserly beggar who 
<A NAME="337"></A>had accumulated great riches: 'It is evident that thou possessest boundless 
<A NAME="338"></A>wealth and we have an affair on hand in which thou canst aid us by way 
<A NAME="339"></A>of a loan. When the finances of the country are in a flourishing condition 
<A NAME="340"></A>it will be repaid.' The miser replied: 'It is not befitting the power and 
<A NAME="341"></A>dignity of a padshah to soil the hands of his noble aspirations with the 
<A NAME="342"></A>property of an individual like myself who has collected it grain by grain.' 
<A NAME="343"></A>The king replied: 'It does not matter because the money will be spent upon 
<A NAME="344"></A>infidels: The wicked women should be joined to the wicked 
<A NAME="345"></A>men."
<A NAME="346"></A><BR><BR>If the water of a Christian's well is impure
<A NAME="347"></A><BR>What matters it if thou washest a dead Jew therein?
<A NAME="348"></A><BR><BR>They said: 'The lime-mortar is not clean.'
<A NAME="349"></A><BR>We replied: 'We shall plug therewith the privy holes."
<A NAME="350"></A><BR><BR>I heard that he refused to comply with the behest of the king, 
<A NAME="351"></A>began to argue and to look insolently; whereon the king ordered the sum 
<A NAME="352"></A>in question to be released from his grasp by force and with a 
<A NAME="353"></A>reprimand.
<A NAME="354"></A><BR><BR>If an affair cannot be accomplished with gentleness
<A NAME="355"></A><BR>He forsooth turns his head to impudence.
<A NAME="356"></A><BR>Who has no regard for himself
<A NAME="357"></A><BR>It is proper that no one should pay him any.
<A NAME="358"></A><BR><BR>Story 22
<A NAME="359"></A><BR><BR>I met a trader who possessed one hundred and fifty camel loads 
<A NAME="360"></A>of merchandise with forty slaves and servants. One evening in the oasis 
<A NAME="361"></A>of Kish he took me into his apartment and taking all night no rest kept 
<A NAME="362"></A>up an incoherent gabble, saying: 'I have such and such a warehouse in Turkestan, 
<A NAME="363"></A>such and such goods in Hindostan; this is the title-deed of such and such 
<A NAME="364"></A>an estate and in this affair such and such a man is security.' He said: 
<A NAME="365"></A>'I intend to go to Alexandria because it has a good climate', and correcting 
<A NAME="366"></A>himself continued: 'No, because the African sea is boisterous. O Sa'di, 
<A NAME="367"></A>I have one journey more to undertake and after performing it I shall during 
<A NAME="368"></A>the rest of my life sit in a corner and enjoy contentment.' I asked: 'What 
<A NAME="369"></A>journey is that?' He replied: 'I shall carry Persian brimstone to China 
<A NAME="370"></A>because I heard that it fetched a high price. I shall also carry Chinese 
<A NAME="371"></A>porcelain to Rum and Rumi brocade to India and Indian steel to Aleppo, 
<A NAME="372"></A>convey glass-ware of Aleppo to Yemen, striped cloth of Yemen to Pares. 
<A NAME="373"></A>After that I shall abandon trading and shall sit down in a shop.' He had 
<A NAME="374"></A>talked so much of this nonsenses that no more strength remained in him 
<A NAME="375"></A>so he said: 'O Sa'di, do thou also tell me something of what thou hast 
<A NAME="376"></A>seen and heard.' I recited:
<A NAME="377"></A><BR><BR>'Thou mayest have heard that in the plain of 
<A NAME="378"></A>Ghur
<A NAME="379"></A><BR>Once a leader fell down from his beast of burden,
<A NAME="380"></A><BR>Saying: "The narrow eye of a wealthy man
<A NAME="381"></A><BR>Will be filled either by content or by the earth
<A NAME="382"></A><BR>of the tomb."'
<A NAME="383"></A><BR><BR>Story 23
<A NAME="384"></A><BR><BR>I heard about a wealthy man who was as well known for his avarice 
<A NAME="385"></A>as Hatim Tai for his liberality. Outwardly he displayed the appearance 
<A NAME="386"></A>of wealth but inwardly his sordid nature was so dominant that he would 
<A NAME="387"></A>not for his life give a morsel of bread to anyone or bestow a scrap upon 
<A NAME="388"></A>the kitten of Abu Harirah or throw a bone to the dog of the companions 
<A NAME="389"></A>of the cave. In short, no one had seen the door of his house open or his 
<A NAME="390"></A>table-doth spread.
<A NAME="391"></A><BR><BR>The dervish got nothing of his food except the 
<A NAME="392"></A>smell.
<A NAME="393"></A><BR>The fowl picked up the crumbs after his bread-dinner.
<A NAME="394"></A><BR><BR>I heard that he was sailing in the Mediterranean with the pride 
<A NAME="395"></A>of Pharaoh in his head-according to the words of the most high, Until drowning 
<A NAME="396"></A>overtook him-when all of a sudden a contrary wind befell the ship, as it 
<A NAME="397"></A>is said:
<A NAME="398"></A><BR><BR>What can thy heart do to thy distressed nature for the wind 
<A NAME="399"></A>is
<A NAME="400"></A><BR>not fair?
<A NAME="401"></A><BR>It is not at all times suitable for a ship.
<A NAME="402"></A><BR><BR>He uplifted the hands of supplication and began to lament in vain 
<A NAME="403"></A>but Allah the most high has commanded: When they sail in a ship they call 
<A NAME="404"></A>upon Allah, sincerely exhibiting unto him their religion.
<A NAME="405"></A><BR><BR>Of what use is the hand of supplication to a needy 
<A NAME="406"></A>worshipper
<A NAME="407"></A><BR>Which is uplifted to God in the time of prayer but in the 
<A NAME="408"></A>armpit
<A NAME="409"></A><BR>in the time of bounty?
<A NAME="410"></A><BR><BR>Bestow comfort with gold and with silver
<A NAME="411"></A><BR>And thereby also profit thyself.
<A NAME="412"></A><BR>As this house of thine will remain,
<A NAME="413"></A><BR>Build it with a silver and a gold brick.
<A NAME="414"></A><BR><BR>It is narrated that he had poor relations in Egypt who became rich 
<A NAME="415"></A>by the remainder of his wealth, tearing up their old cloths and cutting 
<A NAME="416"></A>new ones of silk and of Damiari. During the same week I also beheld one 
<A NAME="417"></A>of them riding a fleet horse with a fairy-faced slave boy at his heels. 
<A NAME="418"></A>I said:
<A NAME="419"></A><BR><BR>'Wah! If the dead man were to return
<A NAME="420"></A><BR>Among his kinsfolk and connections
<A NAME="421"></A><BR>The refunding of the inheritance would be more painful
<A NAME="422"></A><BR>To the heirs than the death of their relative.'
<A NAME="423"></A><BR><BR>On account of the acquaintance which had formerly subsisted between 
<A NAME="424"></A>us, I pulled his sleeve, and said:
<A NAME="425"></A><BR><BR>'Eat thou, O virtuous and good man,
<A NAME="426"></A><BR>What that mean fellow gathered and did not eat.'
<A NAME="427"></A><BR><BR>Story 24
<A NAME="428"></A><BR><BR>A weak fisherman caught a strong fish in his net and not being 
<A NAME="429"></A>able to retain it the fish overcame him and pulled the net from his 
<A NAME="430"></A>hand.
<A NAME="431"></A><BR><BR>A boy went to bring water from the torrent.
<A NAME="432"></A><BR>The torrent came and took the boy away.
<A NAME="433"></A><BR>The net brought every time a fish.
<A NAME="434"></A><BR>This time the fish went and carried off the net.
<A NAME="435"></A><BR><BR>The other fishermen were sorry and blamed him for not being able 
<A NAME="436"></A>to retain such a fish which had fallen into his net. He replied: 'O brothers, 
<A NAME="437"></A>what can be done? My day was not lucky but the fish had yet one remaining. 
<A NAME="438"></A>'Moral: A fisherman cannot catch a fish in the Tigris without a day of 
<A NAME="439"></A>luck and a fish cannot die on dry ground without the decree of 
<A NAME="440"></A>fate.
<A NAME="441"></A><BR><BR>Story 25
<A NAME="442"></A><BR><BR>A man whose hands and feet had been amputated killed a millipede 
<A NAME="443"></A>and a pious passer-by exclaimed: 'Praised be Allah! In spite of the thousand 
<A NAME="444"></A>feet he possessed he could not escape from a man without hands and feet 
<A NAME="445"></A>when his fate had overtaken him.'
<A NAME="446"></A><BR><BR>When the life-taking foe comes in the rear
<A NAME="447"></A><BR>Fate ties the legs of a running man.
<A NAME="448"></A><BR>At the moment when the enemy has slowly arrived
<A NAME="449"></A><BR>It is useless to draw the Kayanian bow.
<A NAME="450"></A><BR><BR>Story 26
<A NAME="451"></A><BR><BR>I have seen a fat fool, dressed in a costly robe, with a turban 
<A NAME="452"></A>of Egyptian linen on his head, riding on an Arab horse. Someone said: 'Sa'di, 
<A NAME="453"></A>what thinkest thou of this famous brocade upon this ignorant animal?' I 
<A NAME="454"></A>replied: 'It is like ugly characters scrawled with gold-water.'
<A NAME="455"></A><BR><BR>Verily he is like an ass among men,
<A NAME="456"></A><BR>A calf, a body which is bleating.
<A NAME="457"></A><BR><BR>This animal cannot be said to resemble a man
<A NAME="458"></A><BR>Except in his cloak, turban and outward adornment.
<A NAME="459"></A><BR>Examine all his property and belongings of his estate
<A NAME="460"></A><BR>Thou wilt find nothing lawful to take except his 
<A NAME="461"></A>blood.
<A NAME="462"></A><BR>If a noble man becomes impoverished imagine not
<A NAME="463"></A><BR>That his high worth will also decrease.
<A NAME="464"></A><BR>But if into a silver threshold golden nails are 
<A NAME="465"></A>driven
<A NAME="466"></A><BR>By a Jew, think not that he will thereby become 
<A NAME="467"></A>noble.
<A NAME="468"></A><BR>Story 27
<A NAME="469"></A><BR><BR>A thief said to a mendicant: 'Art thou not ashamed to stretch out 
<A NAME="470"></A>thy hand for a grain of silver to every sordid fellow?' He 
<A NAME="471"></A>replied:
<A NAME="472"></A><BR><BR>'To hold out the hand for a grain of silver
<A NAME="473"></A><BR>Is better than to get it cut off for one dane and a 
<A NAME="474"></A>half.'
<A NAME="475"></A><BR><BR>Story 28
<A NAME="476"></A><BR><BR>It is related that an athlete had been reduced to the greatest 
<A NAME="477"></A>distress by adverse fortune. His throat being capacious and his hands unable 
<A NAME="478"></A>to fill it, he complained to his father and asked him for permission to 
<A NAME="479"></A>travel as he hoped to be hoped to be able to gain a livelihood by the strength 
<A NAME="480"></A>of his arm.
<A NAME="481"></A><BR><BR>Excellence and skill are lost unless exhibited.
<A NAME="482"></A><BR>Lignum aloes is placed on fire and musk rubbed.
<A NAME="483"></A><BR><BR>The father replied: 'My son, get rid of this vain idea and place 
<A NAME="484"></A>the feet of contentment under the skirt of safety because great men have 
<A NAME="485"></A>said that happiness does not consist in exertion and that the remedy against 
<A NAME="486"></A>want is in the moderation of desires.
<A NAME="487"></A><BR><BR>No one can grasp the skirt of luck by force.
<A NAME="488"></A><BR>It is useless to put vasmah on a bald man's brow.
<A NAME="489"></A><BR><BR>If thou hast two hundred accomplishments for each hair of thy 
<A NAME="490"></A>head
<A NAME="491"></A><BR>They will be of no use if fortune is unpropitious.
<A NAME="492"></A><BR><BR>What can an athlete do with adverse luck?
<A NAME="493"></A><BR>The arm of luck is better than the arm of strength.
<A NAME="494"></A><BR><BR>The son rejoined: 'Father, the advantages of travel are many, such 
<A NAME="495"></A>as recreation of the mind entailing profit, seeing of wonderful and hearing 
<A NAME="496"></A>of strange things, recreation in cities, associating with friends, acquisition 
<A NAME="497"></A>of dignity, rank, property, the power of discriminating among acquaintances 
<A NAME="498"></A>and gaining experience of the world, as the travellers in the Tariqat have 
<A NAME="499"></A>said:
<A NAME="500"></A><BR><BR>As long as thou walkest about the shop or the 
<A NAME="501"></A>house
<A NAME="502"></A><BR>Thou wilt never become a man, 0 raw fellow.
<A NAME="503"></A><BR>Go and travel in the world
<A NAME="504"></A><BR>Before that day when thou goest from the world.'
<A NAME="505"></A><BR><BR>The father replied: 'My son, the advantages of travel such as thou 
<A NAME="506"></A>hast enumerated them are countless but they regard especially five classes 
<A NAME="507"></A>of men: firstly, a merchant who possesses in consequence of his wealth 
<A NAME="508"></A>and power graceful male and female slaves and quick-handed assistants, 
<A NAME="509"></A>alights every day in another town and every night in another place, has 
<A NAME="510"></A>recreation every moment and sometimes enjoys the delights of the 
<A NAME="511"></A>world.'
<A NAME="512"></A><BR><BR>A rich man is not a stranger in mountain, desert or 
<A NAME="513"></A>solitude.
<A NAME="514"></A><BR>Wherever he goes he pitches a tent and makes a sleeping 
<A NAME="515"></A>place;
<A NAME="516"></A><BR>Whilst he who is destitute of the goods of this 
<A NAME="517"></A>world
<A NAME="518"></A><BR>Must be in his own country a stranger and unknown.
<A NAME="519"></A><BR><BR>Secondly, a scholar, who is for the pleasantness of his speech, 
<A NAME="520"></A>the power of his eloquence and the fund of his instruction, waited upon 
<A NAME="521"></A>and honoured wherever he goes.
<A NAME="522"></A><BR><BR>The presence of a learned man is like pure gold
<A NAME="523"></A><BR>Whose power and price is known wherever he goes.
<A NAME="524"></A><BR>An ignorant fellow of noble descent resembles Shahrua,
<A NAME="525"></A><BR>Which nobody accepts in a foreign country.
<A NAME="526"></A><BR><BR>Thirdly, handsome fellows with whom the souls of pious men are 
<A NAME="527"></A>inclined to commingle because it has been said that a little beauty is 
<A NAME="528"></A>better than much wealth. An attractive face is also said to be a slave 
<A NAME="529"></A>to despondent hearts and the key to locked doors, wherefore the society 
<A NAME="530"></A>of such a person is everywhere known to be very acceptable:
<A NAME="531"></A><BR><BR>A beautiful person meets with honour and respect 
<A NAME="532"></A>everywhere
<A NAME="533"></A><BR>Although perhaps driven away in anger by father and 
<A NAME="534"></A>mother.
<A NAME="535"></A><BR>I have seen a peacock feather in the leaves of the 
<A NAME="536"></A>Quran.
<A NAME="537"></A><BR>I said: 'I see thy position is higher than thy deserts.'
<A NAME="538"></A><BR>It said: 'Hush, whoever is endowed with beauty,
<A NAME="539"></A><BR>Wherever he places his foot, hands are held out to receive 
<A NAME="540"></A>it.'
<A NAME="541"></A><BR><BR>When a boy is symmetrical and heart-robbing
<A NAME="542"></A><BR>It matters not if his father disowns him.
<A NAME="543"></A><BR>He is a jewel which must not remain in a shell.
<A NAME="544"></A><BR>A precious pearl everyone desires to buy.
<A NAME="545"></A><BR><BR>Fourthly, one with a sweet voice, who retains, with a David-like 
<A NAME="546"></A>throat, water from flowing and birds from soaring. By means of this talent 
<A NAME="547"></A>he holds the hearts of people captive and religious men are delighted to 
<A NAME="548"></A>associate with him.
<A NAME="549"></A><BR><BR>My audition is intent on the beautiful melody.
<A NAME="550"></A><BR>Who is that performing on the double chord?
<A NAME="551"></A><BR><BR>How pleasant is the gentle and melancholy lay
<A NAME="552"></A><BR>To the ear of the boon companions who quaff the morning 
<A NAME="553"></A>draught!
<A NAME="554"></A><BR>Better than a handsome face is a pleasant voice.
<A NAME="555"></A><BR>The former is joy to the senses, the latter food for the 
<A NAME="556"></A>soul.
<A NAME="557"></A><BR><BR>Fifthly, the artisan, who gains a sufficient livelihood by the 
<A NAME="558"></A>strength of his arm, so that his reputation is not lost in struggling for 
<A NAME="559"></A>bread; as wise men have said:
<A NAME="560"></A><BR><BR>If he goes abroad from his own town
<A NAME="561"></A><BR>The patcher of clothes meets with no bardship or 
<A NAME="562"></A>trouble
<A NAME="563"></A><BR>But if the government falls into ruin
<A NAME="564"></A><BR>The king of Nimruz will go to bed hungry.
<A NAME="565"></A><BR><BR>The qualities which I have explained, 0 my son, are in a journey 
<A NAME="566"></A>the occasion of satisfaction to the mind, stimulants to a happy life but 
<A NAME="567"></A>he, who possesses none of them, goes with idle fancies into the world and 
<A NAME="568"></A>no one will ever hear anything about his name and fame.
<A NAME="569"></A><BR><BR>He whom the turning world is to afflict
<A NAME="570"></A><BR>Will be guided by the times against his aim.
<A NAME="571"></A><BR>A pigeon destined not to see its nest again
<A NAME="572"></A><BR>Will be carried by fate towards the grain and net.
<A NAME="573"></A><BR><BR>The son asked: 'O father, how can I act contrary to the injunctions 
<A NAME="574"></A>of the wise, who have said, that although food is distributed by predestination 
<A NAME="575"></A>the acquisition of it depends upon exertion and that, although a calamity 
<A NAME="576"></A>may be decreed by fate, it is incumbent on men to show the gates by which 
<A NAME="577"></A>it may enter?
<A NAME="578"></A><BR><BR>'Although daily food may come unawares
<A NAME="579"></A><BR>It is reasonable to seek it out of doors
<A NAME="580"></A><BR>And though no one dies without the decree of fate
<A NAME="581"></A><BR>Thou must not rush into the jaws of a dragon.
<A NAME="582"></A><BR><BR>'As I am at present able to cope with a mad elephant and to wrestle 
<A NAME="583"></A>with a furious lion, it is proper, O father, that I should travel abroad 
<A NAME="584"></A>because I have no longer the endurance to suffer misery.
<A NAME="585"></A><BR><BR>'When a man has fallen from his place and station
<A NAME="586"></A><BR>Why should he eat more grief? All the horizons are his 
<A NAME="587"></A>place.
<A NAME="588"></A><BR>At night every rich man goes to an inn.
<A NAME="589"></A><BR>The dervish has his inn where the night overtakes 
<A NAME="590"></A>him.'
<A NAME="591"></A><BR><BR>After saying this, he asked for the good wishes of his father, 
<A NAME="592"></A>took leave of him, departed and said to himself:
<A NAME="593"></A><BR><BR>'A skilful man, when his luck does not favour 
<A NAME="594"></A>him,
<A NAME="595"></A><BR>Goes to a place where people know not his name.'
<A NAME="596"></A><BR><BR>He reached the banks of a water, the force of which was such that 
<A NAME="597"></A>it knocked stones against each other and its roaring was heard to a farsang's 
<A NAME="598"></A>distance.
<A NAME="599"></A><BR><BR>A dreadful water, in which even aquatic birds were not 
<A NAME="600"></A>safe,
<A NAME="601"></A><BR>The smallest wave would whirl off a millstone from its 
<A NAME="602"></A>bank.
<A NAME="603"></A><BR><BR>He beheld a crowd of people, every person sitting with a coin of 
<A NAME="604"></A>money at the crossing-place, intent on a passage. The youth's hands of 
<A NAME="605"></A>payment being tied, he opened the tongue of laudation and although he supplicated 
<A NAME="606"></A>the people greatly, they paid no attention and said:
<A NAME="607"></A><BR><BR>'No violence can be done to anyone without money
<A NAME="608"></A><BR>But if thou hast money thou hast no need of force.'
<A NAME="609"></A><BR><BR>An unkind boatman laughed at him and said:
<A NAME="610"></A><BR><BR>'If thou hast no money thou canst not cross the river by 
<A NAME="611"></A>force.
<A NAME="612"></A><BR>What boots the strength of ten men? Bring the money for 
<A NAME="613"></A>one.'
<A NAME="614"></A><BR><BR>The young man's heart was irritated by the insult of the boatman 
<A NAME="615"></A>and longed to take vengeance upon him. The boat had, however, started; 
<A NAME="616"></A>accordingly he shouted: 'If thou wilt be satisfied with the robe I am wearing, 
<A NAME="617"></A>I shall not grudge giving it to thee.' The boatman was greedy and turned 
<A NAME="618"></A>the vessel back.
<A NAME="619"></A><BR><BR>Desire sews up the vision of a shrewd man.
<A NAME="620"></A><BR>Greediness brings fowl and fish into the snare.
<A NAME="621"></A><BR><BR>As soon as the young man's hand could reach the beard and collar 
<A NAME="622"></A>of the boatman, he immediately knocked him down and a comrade of the boatman, 
<A NAME="623"></A>who came from the vessel to rescue him, experienced the same rough treatment 
<A NAME="624"></A>and turned back. The rest of the people then thought proper to pacify the 
<A NAME="625"></A>young man and to condone his passage money.
<A NAME="626"></A><BR><BR>When thou seest a quarrel be forbearing
<A NAME="627"></A><BR>Because gentlemen will shut the door of strife.
<A NAME="628"></A><BR>Use kindness when thou seest contention.
<A NAME="629"></A><BR>A sharp sword cannot cut soft silk.
<A NAME="630"></A><BR>By a sweet tongue, grace, and kindliness,
<A NAME="631"></A><BR>Thou wilt be able to lead an elephant by a hair.
<A NAME="632"></A><BR><BR>Then the people fell at his feet, craving pardon for what had passed. 
<A NAME="633"></A>They impressed some hypocritical kisses upon his head and his eyes, received 
<A NAME="634"></A>him into the boat and started, progressing till they reached a pillar of 
<A NAME="635"></A>Yunani workmanship, standing in the water. The boatman said: 'The vessel 
<A NAME="636"></A>is in danger. Let one of you, who is the strongest, go to the pillar and 
<A NAME="637"></A>take the cable of the boat that we may save the vessel.' The young man, 
<A NAME="638"></A>in the pride of bravery which he had in his head, did not think of the 
<A NAME="639"></A>offended foe and did not mind the maxim of wise men who have said: 'If 
<A NAME="640"></A>thou hast given offence to one man and afterwards done him a hundred kindnesses, 
<A NAME="641"></A>do not be confident that he will not avenge himself for that one offence, 
<A NAME="642"></A>because although the head of a spear may come out, the memory of an offence 
<A NAME="643"></A>will remain in the heart.'
<A NAME="644"></A><BR><BR>'How well,' said Yaktash to Khiltash,
<A NAME="645"></A><BR>'Hast thou scratched a foe? Do not think thou art 
<A NAME="646"></A>safe.'
<A NAME="647"></A><BR><BR>Be not unconcerned for thou wilt be afflicted
<A NAME="648"></A><BR>If by thy hand a heart has been afflicted.
<A NAME="649"></A><BR>Throw not a stone at the rampart of a fort
<A NAME="650"></A><BR>Because possibly a stone may come from the fort.
<A NAME="651"></A><BR><BR>As soon as he had taken the rope of the boat on his arm, he climbed 
<A NAME="652"></A>to the top of the pillar, whereon the boatman snatched it from his grasp 
<A NAME="653"></A>and pushed the boat off. The helpless man was amazed and spent two days 
<A NAME="654"></A>in misery and distress. On the third, sleep took hold of his collar and 
<A NAME="655"></A>threw him into the water. After one night and day he was cast on the bank, 
<A NAME="656"></A>with some life still remaining in him. He began to eat leaves of trees 
<A NAME="657"></A>and to pull out roots of grass so that when he had gained a little strength, 
<A NAME="658"></A>he turned towards the desert and walked till thirst began to torment him. 
<A NAME="659"></A>He at last reached a well and saw people drinking water for a pashizi but 
<A NAME="660"></A>possessing none he asked for a coin and showed his destitute condition. 
<A NAME="661"></A>The people had, however, no mercy with him, whereon he began to insult 
<A NAME="662"></A>them but likewise ineffectually. Then he knocked down several men but was 
<A NAME="663"></A>at last overpowered, struck and wounded:
<A NAME="664"></A><BR><BR>A swarm of gnats will overpower an elephant
<A NAME="665"></A><BR>Despite of all his virility and bravery.
<A NAME="666"></A><BR>When the little ants combine together
<A NAME="667"></A><BR>They tear the skin of a furious lion.
<A NAME="668"></A><BR><BR>As a matter of necessity he lagged in the rear of the caravan, 
<A NAME="669"></A>which reached in the evening a locality very dangerous on account of thieves. 
<A NAME="670"></A>The people of the caravan trembled in all their limbs but he said: 'Fear 
<A NAME="671"></A>nothing because I alone am able to cope with fifty men and the other youths 
<A NAME="672"></A>of the caravan will aid me.' These boastful words comforted the heart of 
<A NAME="673"></A>the caravan-people, who became glad of his company and considered it incumbent 
<A NAME="674"></A>upon themselves to supply him with food and water. The fire of the young 
<A NAME="675"></A>man's stomach having blazed into flames and deprived his hands of the bridle 
<A NAME="676"></A>of endurance, hunger made him partake of some morsels of food and take 
<A NAME="677"></A>a few draughts of water, till the dev of his interior was set at rest and 
<A NAME="678"></A>he fell asleep. An experienced old fellow, who was in the caravan, said: 
<A NAME="679"></A>'O ye people, I am more afraid of this guard of yours than of the thieves 
<A NAME="680"></A>because there is a story that a stranger had accumulated some dirhems but 
<A NAME="681"></A>could not sleep in the house for fear of the Luris. Accordingly he invited 
<A NAME="682"></A>one of his friends to dispel the terrors of solitude by his company. He 
<A NAME="683"></A>spent several nights with him, till he became aware that he had money and 
<A NAME="684"></A>took it, going on a journey after spending it. When the people saw the 
<A NAME="685"></A>stranger naked and weeping the next morning, a man asked: "What is the 
<A NAME="686"></A>matter? Perhaps a thief has stolen those dirhems of mine?" He replied: 
<A NAME="687"></A>"No, by Allah. The guard has stolen them."'
<A NAME="688"></A><BR><BR>I never sat secure from a serpent
<A NAME="689"></A><BR>Till I learnt what his custom was.
<A NAME="690"></A><BR>The wound from a foe's tooth is severe
<A NAME="691"></A><BR>Who appears to be a friend in the eyes of men.
<A NAME="692"></A><BR><BR>'How do you know whether this man is not one of the band of thieves 
<A NAME="693"></A>and has followed us as a spy to inform his comrades on the proper occasion? 
<A NAME="694"></A>According to my opinion we ought to depart and let him sleep.' The youths 
<A NAME="695"></A>approved of the old man's advice and became suspicious of the athlete, 
<A NAME="696"></A>took up their baggage and departed, leaving him asleep. He knew this when 
<A NAME="697"></A>the sun shone upon his shoulders and perceived that the caravan had started. 
<A NAME="698"></A>He roamed about a great deal without finding the way and thirsty as well 
<A NAME="699"></A>as dismayed as he was, he sat down on the ground, with his heart ready 
<A NAME="700"></A>to perish, saying:
<A NAME="701"></A><BR><BR>Who will speak to me after the yellow camels have 
<A NAME="702"></A>departed?
<A NAME="703"></A><BR>A stranger has no companion except a stranger.
<A NAME="704"></A><BR><BR>He uses harshness towards strangers
<A NAME="705"></A><BR>Who has not himself been exiled enough.
<A NAME="706"></A><BR><BR>The poor man was speaking thus whilst the son of a king who happened 
<A NAME="707"></A>to be in a hunting party, strayed far from the troops, was standing over 
<A NAME="708"></A>his head, listening. He looked at the figure of the athlete, saw that his 
<A NAME="709"></A>outward appearance was respectable but his condition miserable. He then 
<A NAME="710"></A>asked him whence he had come and how he had fallen into this place. The 
<A NAME="711"></A>athlete briefly informed him of what had taken place, whereon the royal 
<A NAME="712"></A>prince, moved by pity, presented him with a robe of honour and a large 
<A NAME="713"></A>sum of money and sent a confidential man to accompany him till he again 
<A NAME="714"></A>reached his native town. His father was glad to see him and expressed gratitude 
<A NAME="715"></A>at his safety. In the evening he narrated to his father what had befallen 
<A NAME="716"></A>him with the boat, mentioned the violence of the boatman, the harshness 
<A NAME="717"></A>of the rustics near the well and the treachery of the caravan people on 
<A NAME="718"></A>the road. The father replied: 'My son, have not I told thee at thy departure 
<A NAME="719"></A>that the brave hands of empty-handed persons are like the broken paw of 
<A NAME="720"></A>a lion?'
<A NAME="721"></A><BR><BR>How well has that empty-handed fighter said:
<A NAME="722"></A><BR>'A grain of gold is better than fifty mann of strength.'
<A NAME="723"></A><BR><BR>The son replied: 'O father, thou wilt certainly not obtain a treasure 
<A NAME="724"></A>except by trouble, wilt not overcome thy foe unless thou hazardest thy 
<A NAME="725"></A>life and wilt not gather a harvest unless thou scatterest seed. Perceivest 
<A NAME="726"></A>thou not how much comfort I gained at the cost of the small amount of trouble 
<A NAME="727"></A>I underwent and what a quantity of honey I have brought in return for the 
<A NAME="728"></A>sting I have suffered.
<A NAME="729"></A><BR><BR>Although not more can be acquired than fate has 
<A NAME="730"></A>decreed
<A NAME="731"></A><BR>Negligence in striving to acquire is not commendable.
<A NAME="732"></A><BR><BR>If a diver fears the crocodile's throat
<A NAME="733"></A><BR>He will never catch the pearl of great price.
<A NAME="734"></A><BR><BR>The nether millstone is immovable, and therefore must bear a 
<A NAME="735"></A>heavy
<A NAME="736"></A><BR>load.
<A NAME="737"></A><BR><BR>What will a fierce lion devour at the bottom of his 
<A NAME="738"></A>den?
<A NAME="739"></A><BR>What food does a fallen hawk obtain?
<A NAME="740"></A><BR>If thou desirest to catch game at home
<A NAME="741"></A><BR>Thou must have hands and feet like a spider.
<A NAME="742"></A><BR><BR>The father said to his son: 'On this occasion heaven has been propitious 
<A NAME="743"></A>to thee and good luck helpful so that a royal person has met thee, has 
<A NAME="744"></A>been bountiful to thee and has thereby healed thy broken condition. Such 
<A NAME="745"></A>coincidences occur seldom and rare events cannot be reckoned 
<A NAME="746"></A>upon.'
<A NAME="747"></A><BR><BR>The hunter does not catch every time a jackal.
<A NAME="748"></A><BR>It may happen that some day a tiger devours him.
<A NAME="749"></A><BR><BR>Thus it happened that one of the kings of Pares, who possessed 
<A NAME="750"></A>a ring with a costly beazle, once went out by way of diversion with some 
<A NAME="751"></A>intimate courtiers to the Masalla of Shiraz and ordered his ring to be 
<A NAME="752"></A>placed on the dome of Asad, promising to bestow the seal-ring upon any 
<A NAME="753"></A>person who could make an arrow pass through it. It happened that every 
<A NAME="754"></A>one of the four hundred archers in his service missed the ring, except 
<A NAME="755"></A>a little boy who was shooting arrows in sport at random and in every direction 
<A NAME="756"></A>from the flat roof of a monastery. The morning breeze caused his arrow 
<A NAME="757"></A>to pass through the ring, whereon he obtained not only the ring but also 
<A NAME="758"></A>a robe of honour and a present of money. It is related that the boy burnt 
<A NAME="759"></A>his bow and arrows and on being asked for the cause replied: 'That the 
<A NAME="760"></A>first splendour may be permanent.'
<A NAME="761"></A><BR><BR>It sometimes happens that an enlightened sage
<A NAME="762"></A><BR>Is not successful in his plans.
<A NAME="763"></A><BR>Sometimes it happens that an ignorant child
<A NAME="764"></A><BR>By mistake hits the target with his arrow.
<A NAME="765"></A><BR><BR>Story 29
<A NAME="766"></A><BR><BR>I heard that a dervish, sitting in a cave, had closed the doors 
<A NAME="767"></A>upon the face of the world, so that no regard for kings and rich persons 
<A NAME="768"></A>remained in the eyes of his desire.
<A NAME="769"></A><BR><BR>Who opens to himself a door for begging
<A NAME="770"></A><BR>Will till he dies remain a needy fellow.
<A NAME="771"></A><BR>Abandon greediness and be a king
<A NAME="772"></A><BR>Because a neck without desire is high.
<A NAME="773"></A><BR><BR>One of the kings of that region sent him the information that, 
<A NAME="774"></A>trusting in the good manners of the respected dervish, he hoped he would 
<A NAME="775"></A>partake of bread and salt with him. The sheikh agreed because it is according 
<A NAME="776"></A>to the sonna to accept an invitation. The next day the king paid him a 
<A NAME="777"></A>visit, the a'bid. leapt up, embraced him, caressed him and praised him. 
<A NAME="778"></A>After the monarch's departure the sheikh was asked by one of his companions 
<A NAME="779"></A>why he had, against his custom, paid so many attentions to the padshah, 
<A NAME="780"></A>the like of which he had never seen before. He replied: 'Hast thou not 
<A NAME="781"></A>heard that one of the pious said:
<A NAME="782"></A><BR><BR>"In whose company thou hast been sitting
<A NAME="783"></A><BR>To do him service thou must necessarily rise.
<A NAME="784"></A><BR><BR>Possibly an ear may during a lifetime
<A NAME="785"></A><BR>Not hear the sound of drum, lute or fife.
<A NAME="786"></A><BR>The eye may be without the sight of a garden.
<A NAME="787"></A><BR>The brain may be without the rose or nasrin.
<A NAME="788"></A><BR>If no feather pillow be at hand
<A NAME="789"></A><BR>Sleep may be had with a stone under the head
<A NAME="790"></A><BR>And if there be no sweetheart to sleep with
<A NAME="791"></A><BR>The hand may be placed on one's own bosom,
<A NAME="792"></A><BR>But this disreputable twisting belly
<A NAME="793"></A><BR>Cannot bear to exist without anything."'
