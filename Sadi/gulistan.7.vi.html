<A NAME="10"></A><B>On Weakness and Old Age</B>
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="11"></A>Story 1
<A NAME="12"></A><BR><BR>I was holding a disputation with a company of learned men in the 
<A NAME="13"></A>cathedral mosque of Damascus when a youth stepped among us, asking whether 
<A NAME="14"></A>anyone knew Persian, whereon most of them pointed to me. I asked him what 
<A NAME="15"></A>the matter was and he said that an old man, aged one hundred and fifty 
<A NAME="16"></A>years, was in the agony of death but saying something in Persian which 
<A NAME="17"></A>nobody could understand and that if I were kindly to go and see him I might 
<A NAME="18"></A>obtain the information whether he was perhaps desirous of making his last 
<A NAME="19"></A>will. When I approached his pillow, he said:
<A NAME="20"></A><BR><BR>'A while ago I said I shall take some rest
<A NAME="21"></A><BR>But alas, the way of my breath is choked.
<A NAME="22"></A><BR>Alas, that from the variegated banquet of life
<A NAME="23"></A><BR>We were eating a while and told it is enough.'
<A NAME="24"></A><BR><BR>I interpreted these words in the Arabic language to the Damascenes 
<A NAME="25"></A>and they were astonished that despite of his long life he regretted the 
<A NAME="26"></A>termination of it so much. I asked him how he felt and he replied: 'What 
<A NAME="27"></A>shall I say?'
<A NAME="28"></A><BR><BR>Hast thou not seen what misery he feels,
<A NAME="29"></A><BR>The teeth of whose mouth are being extracted?
<A NAME="30"></A><BR>Consider what his state will be at the hour
<A NAME="31"></A><BR>When life, so precious to him, abandons his body.
<A NAME="32"></A><BR><BR>I told him not to worry his imagination with the idea of death 
<A NAME="33"></A>and not to allow a hallucination to obtain dominion over his nature because 
<A NAME="34"></A>Ionian philosophers have said that although the constitution may be good 
<A NAME="35"></A>no reliance is to be placed on its permanence and although a malady may 
<A NAME="36"></A>be perilous it does not imply a full indication of death. I asked: 'If 
<A NAME="37"></A>thou art willing, I shall call a physician to treat thee?' He lifted his 
<A NAME="38"></A>eyes and said, smiling:
<A NAME="39"></A><BR><BR>'The skilled doctor strikes his hands together
<A NAME="40"></A><BR>On beholding a rival prostrate like a potsherd.
<A NAME="41"></A><BR>A gentleman is engaged in adorning his hall with 
<A NAME="42"></A>paintings
<A NAME="43"></A><BR>Whilst the very foundation of the house is ruined.
<A NAME="44"></A><BR><BR>An aged man was lamenting in his last agony
<A NAME="45"></A><BR>Whilst his old spouse was rubbing him with sandal.
<A NAME="46"></A><BR>When the equilibrium of the constitution is destroyed
<A NAME="47"></A><BR>Neither incantations nor medicines are of any avail.'
<A NAME="48"></A><BR><BR>Story 2
<A NAME="49"></A><BR><BR>It is related that an old man, having married a girl, was sitting 
<A NAME="50"></A>with her privately in an apartment adorned with roses, fixing his eyes 
<A NAME="51"></A>and heart upon her. He did not sleep during long nights but spent them 
<A NAME="52"></A>in telling her jokes and witty stories, hoping to gain her affection and 
<A NAME="53"></A>to conquer her shyness. One night, however, he informed her that luck had 
<A NAME="54"></A>been friendly to her and the eye of fortune awake because she had become 
<A NAME="55"></A>the companion of an old man who is ripe, educated, experienced in the world, 
<A NAME="56"></A>of a quiet disposition, who had felt cold and warm, had tried good and 
<A NAME="57"></A>bad, who knows the diities of companionship, is ready to fulfil the conditions 
<A NAME="58"></A>of love, is benevolent, kind, good-natured and sweet-tongued.
<A NAME="59"></A><BR><BR>As far as I am able I shall hold thy heart
<A NAME="60"></A><BR>And if injured I shall not injure in return.
<A NAME="61"></A><BR>Though sugar may be thy food as of a parrot
<A NAME="62"></A><BR>I shall sacrifice sweet life to thy support.
<A NAME="63"></A><BR><BR>Thou hast not fallen into the hands of a giddy youth, fun of whims, 
<A NAME="64"></A>headstrong, fickle minded, running about every moment in search of another 
<A NAME="65"></A>pleasure and entertaining another opinion, sleeping every night in another 
<A NAME="66"></A>place and taking every day another friend.
<A NAME="67"></A><BR><BR>Young men are joyous and of handsome countenance
<A NAME="68"></A><BR>But inconstant in fidelity to anyone.
<A NAME="69"></A><BR>Expect not faithfulness from nightingales
<A NAME="70"></A><BR>Who sing every moment to another rose.
<A NAME="71"></A><BR><BR>Contrary to aged men who spend their lives according to wisdom 
<A NAME="72"></A>and propriety; not according to the impulses of folly and 
<A NAME="73"></A>youth.
<A NAME="74"></A><BR><BR>Find one better than thyself and consider it 
<A NAME="75"></A>fortunate
<A NAME="76"></A><BR>Because with one like thyself thou wilt be disappointed.
<A NAME="77"></A><BR><BR>The old man said: 'I continued in this strain, thinking that I 
<A NAME="78"></A>had captivated her heart and that it had become my prey.' She drew, however, 
<A NAME="79"></A>a deep sigh from her grief-filled heart and said: 'All the words thou hast 
<A NAME="80"></A>uttered, weighed in the scales of my understanding, are not equivalent 
<A NAME="81"></A>to the maxim I once heard enounced in my tribe: An arrow in the side of 
<A NAME="82"></A>a young woman is better than an old man.'
<A NAME="83"></A><BR><BR>When she perceived in the hands of her husband
<A NAME="84"></A><BR>Something pendant like the nether lip of a fasting 
<A NAME="85"></A>man,
<A NAME="86"></A><BR>She said: 'This fellow has a corpse with him
<A NAME="87"></A><BR>But incantations are for sleepers not for corpses.'
<A NAME="88"></A><BR><BR>A woman who arises without satisfaction from a 
<A NAME="89"></A>man
<A NAME="90"></A><BR>Will raise many a quarrel and contention.
<A NAME="91"></A><BR>An old man who is unable to rise from his place,
<A NAME="92"></A><BR>Except by the aid of a stick, how can his own stick 
<A NAME="93"></A>rise?
<A NAME="94"></A><BR><BR>In short, there being no possibility of harmony, a separation at 
<A NAME="95"></A>last took place. When the time of the lady's uddat had terminated, she 
<A NAME="96"></A>was given in marriage to a young man who was violent, ill-humoured and 
<A NAME="97"></A>empty-handed. She suffered much from his bad temper and tyrannical behaviour, 
<A NAME="98"></A>and experienced the miseries of penury. She nevertheless said: 'Praise 
<A NAME="99"></A>be to Allah for having been delivered from that wretched torment, and attained 
<A NAME="100"></A>this permanent blessing.'
<A NAME="101"></A><BR><BR>Despite of all this violence and hasty nature
<A NAME="102"></A><BR>I shall try to please thee because thou art beauteous.
<A NAME="103"></A><BR>To be with thee in hell burning is for me
<A NAME="104"></A><BR>Better than to be with the other in paradise.
<A NAME="105"></A><BR>The smell of an onion from the mouth of a pretty 
<A NAME="106"></A>face
<A NAME="107"></A><BR>Is indeed better than a rose from an ugly hand.
<A NAME="108"></A><BR>A nice face and a gown of gold brocade,
<A NAME="109"></A><BR>Essence of roses, fragrant aloes, paint, perfume and 
<A NAME="110"></A>lust:
<A NAME="111"></A><BR>All these are ornaments of women.
<A NAME="112"></A><BR>Take a man; and his testicles are a sufficient ornament.
<A NAME="113"></A><BR><BR>Story 3
<A NAME="114"></A><BR><BR>I was in Diarbekr, the guest of an old man, who possessed abundant 
<A NAME="115"></A>wealth and a beautiful son. One night he narrated to me that he had all 
<A NAME="116"></A>his life no other son but this boy, telling me that in the locality people 
<A NAME="117"></A>resorted to a certain tree in a valley to offer petitions and that he had 
<A NAME="118"></A>during many nights prayed at the foot of the said tree, till the Almighty 
<A NAME="119"></A>granted him this son. I overheard the boy whispering to his companion: 
<A NAME="120"></A>'How good it would be if I knew where that tree is that I might pray for 
<A NAME="121"></A>my father to die.' Moral: The gentleman is delighted that his son is intelligent 
<A NAME="122"></A>and the boy complains that his father is a dotard.
<A NAME="123"></A><BR><BR>Years elapse without thy visiting
<A NAME="124"></A><BR>The tomb of thy father.
<A NAME="125"></A><BR>What good hast thou done to him
<A NAME="126"></A><BR>To expect the same from thy son?
<A NAME="127"></A><BR><BR>Story 4
<A NAME="128"></A><BR><BR>One day, in the pride of youth, I had travelled hard and arrived 
<A NAME="129"></A>perfectly exhausted in the evening at the foot of an acclivity. A weak 
<A NAME="130"></A>old man, who had likewise been following the caravan, came and asked me 
<A NAME="131"></A>why I was sleeping, this not being the place for it. I replied: 'How am 
<A NAME="132"></A>I to travel, having lost the use of my feet?' He said: 'Hast thou not heard 
<A NAME="133"></A>that it is better to walk gently and to halt now and then than to run and 
<A NAME="134"></A>to become exhausted?'
<A NAME="135"></A><BR><BR>O thou who desirest to reach the station
<A NAME="136"></A><BR>Take my advice and learn patience.
<A NAME="137"></A><BR>An Arab horse gallops twice in a race.
<A NAME="138"></A><BR>A camel ambles gently night and day.
<A NAME="139"></A><BR><BR>Story 5
<A NAME="140"></A><BR><BR>The active, graceful, smiling, sweet-tongued youth happened once 
<A NAME="141"></A>to be in the circle of our assembly. His heart had been entered by no kind 
<A NAME="142"></A>of grief and his lips were scarcely ever closed from laughter. After some 
<A NAME="143"></A>time had elapsed, I accidentally met him again and I learned that he had 
<A NAME="144"></A>married a wife and begotten children but I saw that the root of merriment 
<A NAME="145"></A>had been cut and the roses of his countenance were withered. I asked him 
<A NAME="146"></A>how he felt and what his circumstances were. He replied: 'When I had obtained 
<A NAME="147"></A>children I left off childishness.'
<A NAME="148"></A><BR><BR>Where is youth when age has changed my ringlets?
<A NAME="149"></A><BR>And the change of time is a sufficient monitor.
<A NAME="150"></A><BR><BR>When thou art old abstain from puerility.
<A NAME="151"></A><BR>Leave play and jokes to youths.
<A NAME="152"></A><BR><BR>Seek not a youth's hilarity in an old man
<A NAME="153"></A><BR>For the water gone from the brook returns no more.
<A NAME="154"></A><BR>When the harvest-time of a field arrives
<A NAME="155"></A><BR>It will no longer wave in the breeze like a young 
<A NAME="156"></A>crop.
<A NAME="157"></A><BR><BR>The period of youth has departed.
<A NAME="158"></A><BR>Alas, for those heart-enchanting times.
<A NAME="159"></A><BR>The force of the lion's claws is gone.
<A NAME="160"></A><BR>Now we are satisfied with cheese Eke a leopard.
<A NAME="161"></A><BR><BR>An old hag had dyed her hair black.
<A NAME="162"></A><BR>I said to her: 'O little mother of ancient days,
<A NAME="163"></A><BR>Thou hast cunningly dyed thy hair but consider
<A NAME="164"></A><BR>That thy bent back will never be straight.'
<A NAME="165"></A><BR><BR>Story 6
<A NAME="166"></A><BR><BR>In the folly of youth I one day shouted at my mother who then sat 
<A NAME="167"></A>down with a grieved heart in a corner and said, weeping: 'Hast thou forgotten 
<A NAME="168"></A>thy infancy that thou art harsh towards me?'
<A NAME="169"></A><BR><BR>How sweetly said the old woman to her son
<A NAME="170"></A><BR>When she saw him overthrow a tiger, and elephant-bodied:
<A NAME="171"></A><BR>'If thou hadst remembered the time of thy infancy
<A NAME="172"></A><BR>How helpless thou wast in my arms
<A NAME="173"></A><BR>Thou would'st this day not have been harsh
<A NAME="174"></A><BR>For thou art a lion-like man, and I an old woman.'
<A NAME="175"></A><BR><BR>Story 7
<A NAME="176"></A><BR><BR>The son of a wealthy but avaricious old man, having fallen sick, 
<A NAME="177"></A>his well-wishers advised him that it would be proper to get the whole Quran 
<A NAME="178"></A>recited or else to offer a sacrifice. He meditated a while and then said: 
<A NAME="179"></A>'It is preferable to read the Quran because the flock is at a distance.' 
<A NAME="180"></A>A holy man, who had heard this, afterwards remarked: 'He selected the reading 
<A NAME="181"></A>of the Quran because it is at the tip of the tongue but the money at the 
<A NAME="182"></A>bottom of the heart.'
<A NAME="183"></A><BR><BR>It is useful to bend the neck in prayers
<A NAME="184"></A><BR>If they are to be accompanied by almsgiving.
<A NAME="185"></A><BR>For one dinar he would remain sticking in mud like an 
<A NAME="186"></A>ass,
<A NAME="187"></A><BR>But if thou askest for Alhamdu he will recite it a hundred 
<A NAME="188"></A>times.
<A NAME="189"></A><BR><BR>Story 8
<A NAME="190"></A><BR><BR>An old man, having been asked why he did not marry, replied that 
<A NAME="191"></A>he could not be happy with an aged woman, and on being told that as he 
<A NAME="192"></A>was a man of property, he might take a young one, he said: 'I being an 
<A NAME="193"></A>old man and unwilling to associate with an old woman, how could a young 
<A NAME="194"></A>one conceive friendship for me who am aged?'
<A NAME="195"></A><BR><BR>Let not a man of seventy years make love.
<A NAME="196"></A><BR>Thou art confessedly blind, kiss her and sleep.
<A NAME="197"></A><BR>The lady wants strength, not gold.
<A NAME="198"></A><BR>One passage is preferable to her than ten mann of 
<A NAME="199"></A>flesh.
<A NAME="200"></A><BR><BR>Story 9
<A NAME="201"></A><BR><BR>I have heard that in these days a decrepit aged 
<A NAME="202"></A>man
<A NAME="203"></A><BR>Took the fancy in his old head to get a spouse.
<A NAME="204"></A><BR>He married a beauteous little girl, Jewel by name,
<A NAME="205"></A><BR>When he had concealed his casket of jewels from the eyes of 
<A NAME="206"></A>men
<A NAME="207"></A><BR>A spectacle took place as is customary in weddings.
<A NAME="208"></A><BR>But in the first onslaught the organ of the sheikh fell 
<A NAME="209"></A>asleep.
<A NAME="210"></A><BR>He spanned the bow but hit not the target; it being
<A NAME="211"></A><BR>impossible to sew
<A NAME="212"></A><BR>A tight coarse robe except with a needle of steel.
<A NAME="213"></A><BR>He complained to his friends and showed proofs
<A NAME="214"></A><BR>That his furniture had been utterly destroyed by her 
<A NAME="215"></A>impudence.
<A NAME="216"></A><BR>Such fighting and contention arose between man and 
<A NAME="217"></A>wife
<A NAME="218"></A><BR>That the affair came before the qazi; and Sa'di 
<A NAME="219"></A>said:
<A NAME="220"></A><BR>'After all this reproach and villainy the fault is not the 
<A NAME="221"></A>girl's.
<A NAME="222"></A><BR>Thou whose hand trembles, how canst thou bore a 
<A NAME="223"></A>Jewel?'
