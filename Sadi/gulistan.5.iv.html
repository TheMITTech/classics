<A NAME="10"></A><B>On the Advantages of Silence</B>
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="11"></A>Story 1
<A NAME="12"></A><BR><BR>I said to a friend that I have chosen rather to be silent than 
<A NAME="13"></A>to speak because on most occasions good and bad words are scattered concurrently 
<A NAME="14"></A>but enemies perceive only the latter. He replied: 'That enemy is the greatest 
<A NAME="15"></A>who does not see any good.'
<A NAME="16"></A><BR><BR>The brother of enmity passes not near a good 
<A NAME="17"></A>man
<A NAME="18"></A><BR>Except to consider him as a most wicked liar.
<A NAME="19"></A><BR><BR>Virtue is to the eyes of enmity the greatest 
<A NAME="20"></A>fault.
<A NAME="21"></A><BR>Sa'di is a rose but to the eye of enemies a thorn.
<A NAME="22"></A><BR><BR>The world illumining sun and fountain of light
<A NAME="23"></A><BR>Look ugly to the eye of the mole.
<A NAME="24"></A><BR><BR>Story 2
<A NAME="25"></A><BR><BR>A merchant, having suffered loss of a thousand dinars, enjoined 
<A NAME="26"></A>his son not to reveal it to anyone. The boy said: 'It is thy order and 
<A NAME="27"></A>I shall not tell it but thou must inform me of the utility of this proceeding 
<A NAME="28"></A>and of the propriety of concealment.' He replied: 'For fear the misfortune 
<A NAME="29"></A>would be double; namely, the loss of the money and, secondly, the joy of 
<A NAME="30"></A>neighbours at our loss.'
<A NAME="31"></A><BR><BR>Reveal not thy grief to enemies
<A NAME="32"></A><BR>Because they will say 'La haul' but rejoice.
<A NAME="33"></A><BR><BR>Story 3
<A NAME="34"></A><BR><BR>An intelligent youth possessed an abundant share of accomplishments 
<A NAME="35"></A>and discreet behaviour so that he was allowed to sit in assemblies of learned 
<A NAME="36"></A>men but he refrained from conversing with them. His father once asked him 
<A NAME="37"></A>why he did not likewise speak on subjects he was acquainted with. He replied: 
<A NAME="38"></A>'I fear I may be asked what I do not know and be put to 
<A NAME="39"></A>shame.'
<A NAME="40"></A><BR><BR>Hast thou heard how a Sufi drove
<A NAME="41"></A><BR>A few nails under his sandals
<A NAME="42"></A><BR>And an officer taking him by the sleeve
<A NAME="43"></A><BR>Said to him: 'Come and shoe my horse.'
<A NAME="44"></A><BR><BR>For what thou hast not said no one will trouble 
<A NAME="45"></A>thee
<A NAME="46"></A><BR>But when thou hast spoken bring the proof.
<A NAME="47"></A><BR><BR>Story 4
<A NAME="48"></A><BR><BR>A scholar of note had a controversy with an unbeliever but, being 
<A NAME="49"></A>unable to cope with him in argument, shook his head and retired. Someone 
<A NAME="50"></A>asked him how it came to pass that, with all his eloquence and learning, 
<A NAME="51"></A>he had been unable vanquish an irreligious man. He replied: 'My learning 
<A NAME="52"></A>is in the Quran, in tradition and in the sayings of sheikhs, which he neither 
<A NAME="53"></A>believes in nor listens to. Then of what use is it to me to hear him 
<A NAME="54"></A>blaspheming?'
<A NAME="55"></A><BR><BR>To him of whom thou canst not rid thyself by the Quran and 
<A NAME="56"></A>tradition
<A NAME="57"></A><BR>The best reply is if thou dost not reply anything.
<A NAME="58"></A><BR><BR>Story 5
<A NAME="59"></A><BR><BR>Galenus saw a fool hanging on with his hands to the collar of a 
<A NAME="60"></A>learned man and insulting him, whereon he said: 'If he were learned he 
<A NAME="61"></A>would not have come to this pass with an ignorant man.'
<A NAME="62"></A><BR><BR>Two wise men do not contend and quarrel
<A NAME="63"></A><BR>Nor does a scholar fight with a contemptible fellow.
<A NAME="64"></A><BR>If an ignorant man in his rudeness speaks harshly
<A NAME="65"></A><BR>An intelligent man tenderly reconciles his heart.
<A NAME="66"></A><BR>Two pious men keep a hair between them untorn
<A NAME="67"></A><BR>And so does a mild with a headstrong man.
<A NAME="68"></A><BR>If however both sides are fools
<A NAME="69"></A><BR>If there be a chain they will snap it.
<A NAME="70"></A><BR>An ill-humoured man insulted someone.
<A NAME="71"></A><BR>He bore it and replied: 'O man of happy issue,
<A NAME="72"></A><BR>I am worse than thou canst say that I am
<A NAME="73"></A><BR>Because I know thou art not aware of my faults as I 
<A NAME="74"></A>am.
<A NAME="75"></A><BR><BR>Story 6
<A NAME="76"></A><BR><BR>Subhan Vail is considered to have had no equal in rhetorics because 
<A NAME="77"></A>he had addressed an assembly during a year and had not repeated the same 
<A NAME="78"></A>word but, when the same meaning happened to occur, he expressed it in another 
<A NAME="79"></A>manner and this is one of the accomplishments of courtiers and 
<A NAME="80"></A>princes.
<A NAME="81"></A><BR><BR>A word if heart-binding and sweet
<A NAME="82"></A><BR>Is worthy of belief and of approbation.
<A NAME="83"></A><BR>When thou hast once said it do not utter it again
<A NAME="84"></A><BR>Because sweets, once partaken of, suffice.
<A NAME="85"></A><BR><BR>Story 7
<A NAME="86"></A><BR><BR>I heard a philosopher say that no one has ever made a confession 
<A NAME="87"></A>of his own folly except he who begins speaking, whilst another has not 
<A NAME="88"></A>yet finished his talk.
<A NAME="89"></A><BR><BR>Words have a head, O shrewd man, and a tail.
<A NAME="90"></A><BR>Do not insert thy words between words of others.
<A NAME="91"></A><BR>The possessor of deliberation, intelligence and 
<A NAME="92"></A>shrewdness
<A NAME="93"></A><BR>Does not say a word till he sees silence.
<A NAME="94"></A><BR><BR>Story 8
<A NAME="95"></A><BR><BR>Several officials of Sultan Mahmud asked Hasan Muimandi one day 
<A NAME="96"></A>what the sultan had told him about a certain affair. He replied: 'You must 
<A NAME="97"></A>yourselves have heard it.' They rejoined: 'What he says to thee he does 
<A NAME="98"></A>not think proper to communicate to the like of us.' He answered: 'Because 
<A NAME="99"></A>he trusts that I shall not reveal it. Then why do you ask me to do 
<A NAME="100"></A>so?'
<A NAME="101"></A><BR><BR>A knowing man will not utter every word which occurs to 
<A NAME="102"></A>him.
<A NAME="103"></A><BR>It is not proper to endanger one's head for the king's 
<A NAME="104"></A>secret.
<A NAME="105"></A><BR><BR>Story 9
<A NAME="106"></A><BR><BR>I was hesitating in the conclusion of a bargain for the purchase 
<A NAME="107"></A>of a house when a Jew said: 'Buy it for I am one of the landholders of 
<A NAME="108"></A>this ward. Ask me for a description of the house as it is and it has no 
<A NAME="109"></A>defect.' I replied: 'Except that thou art the neighbour of 
<A NAME="110"></A>it.'
<A NAME="111"></A><BR><BR>A house which has a neighbour like thee
<A NAME="112"></A><BR>Is worth ten dirhems of a deficient standard
<A NAME="113"></A><BR>But the hope must be entertained
<A NAME="114"></A><BR>That after thy death it will be worth a thousand.
<A NAME="115"></A><BR><BR>Story 10
<A NAME="116"></A><BR><BR>A poet went to an amir of robbers and recited a panegyric but he 
<A NAME="117"></A>ordered him to be divested of his robe. As the poor man was departing naked 
<A NAME="118"></A>in the world, he was attacked from behind by dogs, whereon he intended 
<A NAME="119"></A>to snatch up a stone but it was frozen to the ground and, being unable 
<A NAME="120"></A>to do so, he exclaimed: 'What whore-sons of men are these? They have let 
<A NAME="121"></A>loose the dogs and have tied down the stones.' The amir of the robbers 
<A NAME="122"></A>who heard these words from his room laughed and said: 'O philosopher, ask 
<A NAME="123"></A>something from me.' He replied: 'I ask for my robe if thou wilt make me 
<A NAME="124"></A>a present of it.'
<A NAME="125"></A><BR><BR>We are satisfied of thy gift by departure.
<A NAME="126"></A><BR><BR>A man was hoping for the gifts of people.
<A NAME="127"></A><BR>I hope no gift from thee. Do me no evil.
<A NAME="128"></A><BR><BR>The robber chief took pity upon him, ordered his robe to be restored 
<A NAME="129"></A>to him and added to it a sheepskin jacket with some 
<A NAME="130"></A>dirhems.
<A NAME="131"></A><BR><BR>Story 11
<A NAME="132"></A><BR><BR>An astrologer, having entered his own house, saw a stranger and, 
<A NAME="133"></A>getting angry, began to insult him, whereon both fell upon each other and 
<A NAME="134"></A>fought so that turmoil and confusion ensued. A pious man who had the scene 
<A NAME="135"></A>exclaimed:
<A NAME="136"></A><BR><BR>'How knowest thou what is in the zenith of the 
<A NAME="137"></A>sky
<A NAME="138"></A><BR>If thou art not aware who is in thy house?'
<A NAME="139"></A><BR><BR>Story 12
<A NAME="140"></A><BR><BR>A preacher imagined his miserable voice to be pleasing and raised 
<A NAME="141"></A>useless shouts, thou wouldst have said that the crow of separation had 
<A NAME="142"></A>become the tune of his song; and the verse- for the most detestable of 
<A NAME="143"></A>voices is surely the voice of asses- appears to have been applicable to 
<A NAME="144"></A>him. This distich also concerns him:
<A NAME="145"></A><BR><BR>When the preacher Abu-l-Fares brays
<A NAME="146"></A><BR>At his voice Istakhar-Fares quakes.
<A NAME="147"></A><BR><BR>On account of the position he occupied the inhabitants of the locality 
<A NAME="148"></A>submitted to the hardship and did not think proper to molest him. In course 
<A NAME="149"></A>of time, however, another preacher of that region, who bore secret enmity 
<A NAME="150"></A>towards him, arrived on a visit and said to him: 'I have dreamt about thee, 
<A NAME="151"></A>may it end well!' 'What hast thou dreamt?' 'I dreamt that thy voice had 
<A NAME="152"></A>become pleasant and that the people were comfortable during thy sermons.' 
<A NAME="153"></A>The preacher meditated a while on these words and then said: 'Thou hast 
<A NAME="154"></A>dreamt a blessed dream because thou hast made me aware of my defect. It 
<A NAME="155"></A>has become known to me that I have a disagreeable voice and that the people 
<A NAME="156"></A>are displeased with my loud reading. Accordingly I have determined henceforth 
<A NAME="157"></A>not to address them except in a subdued voice':
<A NAME="158"></A><BR><BR>I am displeased with the company of friends
<A NAME="159"></A><BR>To whom my bad qualities appear to be good.
<A NAME="160"></A><BR>They fancy my faults are virtues and perfection.
<A NAME="161"></A><BR>My thorns they believe to be rose and jessamine.
<A NAME="162"></A><BR><B>Say.</B> Where is the bold and quick enemy
<A NAME="163"></A><BR>To make me aware of my defects?
<A NAME="164"></A><BR><BR>He whose faults are not told him
<A NAME="165"></A><BR>Ignorantly thinks his defects are virtues.
<A NAME="166"></A><BR><BR>Story 13
<A NAME="167"></A><BR><BR>A man used to shout superfluous calls to prayers in the mosque 
<A NAME="168"></A>of Sinjar and in a voice which displeased all who heard it. The owner of 
<A NAME="169"></A>the mosque, who was a just and virtuous amir, not desirous to give him 
<A NAME="170"></A>pain, said: 'My good fellow, in this mosque there are old muezzins' to 
<A NAME="171"></A>each of whom I pay five dinars monthly but to thee I shall give ten, if 
<A NAME="172"></A>thou wilt go to another place.' The man agreed and went away. Some time 
<A NAME="173"></A>afterwards however, he returned to the amir and said: 'My lord, thou hast 
<A NAME="174"></A>injured me by turning me away for ten dinars from this place because where 
<A NAME="175"></A>I next went they offered me twenty dinars to go to another locality but 
<A NAME="176"></A>I refused.' The amir smiled and said: 'By no means accept them because 
<A NAME="177"></A>will give thee even fifty dinars.'
<A NAME="178"></A><BR><BR>No one can scrape the mud from gravel with an 
<A NAME="179"></A>axe
<A NAME="180"></A><BR>As thy discordant shouting scrapes the heart.
<A NAME="181"></A><BR><BR>Story 14
<A NAME="182"></A><BR><BR>A fellow with a disagreeable voice happened to be reading the Quran, 
<A NAME="183"></A>when a pious man passed near, and asked him what his monthly salary was. 
<A NAME="184"></A>He replied: 'Nothing.' He further inquired: 'Then why takest thou this 
<A NAME="185"></A>trouble?' He replied: 'I am reading for God's sake.' He replied: 'For God's 
<A NAME="186"></A>sake do not read.'
<A NAME="187"></A><BR><BR>If thou readest the Quran thus
<A NAME="188"></A><BR>Thou wilt deprive the religion of splendour.
