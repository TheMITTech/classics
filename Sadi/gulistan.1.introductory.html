<A NAME="10"></A><B>In the Name of Allah the Merciful the Clement</B>
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="11"></A>Laudation to the God of majesty and glory! Obedience to him is a cause 
<A NAME="12"></A>of approach and gratitude in increase of benefits. Every inhalation of 
<A NAME="13"></A>the breath prolongs life and every expiration of it gladdens our nature; 
<A NAME="14"></A>wherefore every breath confers two benefits and for every benefit gratitude 
<A NAME="15"></A>is due.
<A NAME="16"></A><BR><BR>Whose hand and tongue is capable
<A NAME="17"></A><BR>To fulfil the obligations of thanks to him?
<A NAME="18"></A><BR><BR>Words of the most high: Be thankful, O family of David, and but 
<A NAME="19"></A>few of my servants are thankful.
<A NAME="20"></A><BR><BR>It is best to a worshipper for his transgressions
<A NAME="21"></A><BR>To offer apologies at the throne of God,
<A NAME="22"></A><BR>Although what is worthy of his dignity
<A NAME="23"></A><BR>No one is able to accomplish.
<A NAME="24"></A><BR><BR>The showers of his boundless mercy have penetrated to every spot, 
<A NAME="25"></A>and the banquet of his unstinted liberality is spread out everywhere. He 
<A NAME="26"></A>tears not the veil of reputation of his worshippers even for grievous sins, 
<A NAME="27"></A>and does not withhold their daily allowance of bread for great 
<A NAME="28"></A>crimes.
<A NAME="29"></A><BR><BR>O bountiful One, who from thy invisible treasury
<A NAME="30"></A><BR>Suppliest the Guebre and the Christian with food,
<A NAME="31"></A><BR>How could'st thou disappoint thy friends,
<A NAME="32"></A><BR>Whilst having regard for thy enemies?
<A NAME="33"></A><BR><BR>He told the chamberlain of the morning breeze to spread out the 
<A NAME="34"></A>emerald carpet and, having commanded the nurse of vernal clouds to cherish 
<A NAME="35"></A>the daughters of plants in the cradle of the earth, the trees donned the 
<A NAME="36"></A>new year's robe and clothed their breast with the garment of green foliage, 
<A NAME="37"></A>whilst their offspring, the branches, adorned their heads with blossoms 
<A NAME="38"></A>at the approach of the season of the roses. Also the juice of the cane 
<A NAME="39"></A>became delicious honey by his power, and the date a lofty tree by his 
<A NAME="40"></A>care.
<A NAME="41"></A><BR><BR>Cloud and wind, moon and sun move in the sky
<A NAME="42"></A><BR>That thou mayest gain bread, and not eat it unconcerned.
<A NAME="43"></A><BR>For thee all are revolving and obedient.
<A NAME="44"></A><BR>It is against the requirements of justice if thou obeyest 
<A NAME="45"></A>not.
<A NAME="46"></A><BR><BR>There is a tradition of the prince of created beings, the paragon 
<A NAME="47"></A>of existing things, the mercy to the inhabitants of the world, the purest 
<A NAME="48"></A>of mankind and the completion of the revolving ages, Muhammad the elect, 
<A NAME="49"></A>upon whom be blessing and peace:
<A NAME="50"></A><BR><BR>Intercessor, obeyed, prophet, gracious,
<A NAME="51"></A><BR>Bountiful, majestic, affable, marked with the seal of 
<A NAME="52"></A>God.
<A NAME="53"></A><BR><BR>What danger is there to the wall of the faithful with thee for 
<A NAME="54"></A>a
<A NAME="55"></A><BR>buttress?
<A NAME="56"></A><BR><BR>What fear of the waves of the sea has he whose pilot is 
<A NAME="57"></A>Noah?
<A NAME="58"></A><BR><BR>He attained exaltation by his perfection.
<A NAME="59"></A><BR>He disspelled darkness by his beauty.
<A NAME="60"></A><BR>Beauteous are all his qualities,
<A NAME="61"></A><BR>Benediction be on him and on his family.
<A NAME="62"></A><BR><BR>The tradition is that whenever a sinful and distressed worshipper 
<A NAME="63"></A>stretches forth the hand of repentance with hopes of acceptance to the 
<A NAME="64"></A>court of heaven, God the most high does not notice him, whereon he continues 
<A NAME="65"></A>to implore mercy with supplications and tears and God the most holy says: 
<A NAME="66"></A>O my angels, verily I am ashamed of my servant and he has no other lord 
<A NAME="67"></A>besides myself. Accordingly I have fully pardoned him.
<A NAME="68"></A><BR><BR>See the generosity and kindness of God.
<A NAME="69"></A><BR>The servant has committed sin and he is ashamed.
<A NAME="70"></A><BR><BR>Those who attend permanently at the temple of his glory confess 
<A NAME="71"></A>the imperfection of their worship and say: We have not worshipped thee 
<A NAME="72"></A>according to the requirements of thy worship; and those who describe the 
<A NAME="73"></A>splendour of his beauty are rapt in amazement saying: We have not known 
<A NAME="74"></A>thee as thou oughtest to be known.
<A NAME="75"></A><BR><BR>If someone asks me for his description,
<A NAME="76"></A><BR>What shall I despairing say of One who has no form?
<A NAME="77"></A><BR>The lovers have been slain by the beloved.
<A NAME="78"></A><BR>No voice can come from the slain.
<A NAME="79"></A><BR><BR>One of the devout who had deeply plunged his head into the cowl 
<A NAME="80"></A>of meditation and had been immersed in the ocean of visions, was asked, 
<A NAME="81"></A>when he had come out of that state, by one of his companions who had desired 
<A NAME="82"></A>to cheer him up: 'What beautiful gift hast thou brought us from the garden 
<A NAME="83"></A>in which thou hast been?' He replied: 'I intended to fill the skirts of 
<A NAME="84"></A>my robe with roses, when I reached the rose-tree, as presents for my friends 
<A NAME="85"></A>but the perfume of the flowers intoxicated me so much that I let, go the 
<A NAME="86"></A>hold of my skirts.'
<A NAME="87"></A><BR><BR>O bird of the morning, learn love from the moth
<A NAME="88"></A><BR>Because it burnt, lost its life, and found no voice.
<A NAME="89"></A><BR>These pretenders are ignorantly in search of Him,
<A NAME="90"></A><BR>Because he who obtained knowledge has not returned.
<A NAME="91"></A><BR><BR>O thou who art above all imaginations, conjectures, opinions 
<A NAME="92"></A>and
<A NAME="93"></A><BR>ideas,
<A NAME="94"></A><BR>Above anything people have said or we have heard or 
<A NAME="95"></A>read,
<A NAME="96"></A><BR>The assembly is finished and life has reached its 
<A NAME="97"></A>term
<A NAME="98"></A><BR>And we have, as at first, remained powerless in describing 
<A NAME="99"></A>thee.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="100"></A><B>Panegyric of the Padshah of Islam</B>

<A NAME="101"></A><BR>may Allah perpetuate his reign
<A NAME="102"></A><BR><BR>The good reputation of Sa'di which is current among the people, 
<A NAME="103"></A>the renown of his eloquence which has spread on the surface of the earth, 
<A NAME="104"></A>the products of his friendly pen which are consumed like sugar, and the 
<A NAME="105"></A>scraps of his literary compositions which are hawked about like bills of 
<A NAME="106"></A>exchange, cannot be ascribed to his virtue and perfection, but the lord 
<A NAME="107"></A>of the world, the axis of the revolving circle of time, the vice-gerent 
<A NAME="108"></A>of Solomon, protector of the followers of the religion, His Majesty the 
<A NAME="109"></A>Shahanshah Atabek Aa'zm Muzaffaruddin Abu Bekr Ben Sa'd Ben Zanki-The shadow 
<A NAME="110"></A>of Allah on earth! O Lord, be pleased with him and with his kingdom-has 
<A NAME="111"></A>looked upon Sa'di with a favourable eye, has praised him greatly, and has 
<A NAME="112"></A>shown him sincere affection so that all men, gentle and simple, love him 
<A NAME="113"></A>because the people follow the religion of their king.
<A NAME="114"></A><BR><BR>Because thou lookest upon my humble person,
<A NAME="115"></A><BR>My merits are more celebrated than those of the 
<A NAME="116"></A>sun.
<A NAME="117"></A><BR>Although this slave may possess all faults,
<A NAME="118"></A><BR>Every fault pleasing the Sultan becomes a virtue.
<A NAME="119"></A><BR><BR>A sweet-smelling piece of clay, one day in the 
<A NAME="120"></A>bath,
<A NAME="121"></A><BR>Came from the hand of a beloved one to my hand.
<A NAME="122"></A><BR>I asked: 'Art thou musk or ambergris?
<A NAME="123"></A><BR>Because thy delicious odour intoxicates me.'
<A NAME="124"></A><BR>It replied: 'I was a despicable lump of day;
<A NAME="125"></A><BR>But for a while in the society of a rose.
<A NAME="126"></A><BR>The perfection of my companion took effect on me
<A NAME="127"></A><BR>And, if not, I am the same earth which I am.'
<A NAME="128"></A><BR><BR>O Allah, favour the Musalmans with the prolongation of his life, 
<A NAME="129"></A>and with an augmentation of his reward for his good qualities and deeds; 
<A NAME="130"></A>exalt the dignities of his friends and governors; annihilate those who 
<A NAME="131"></A>are inimical to him and wish him ill; for the sake of what is recorded 
<A NAME="132"></A>in the verses of the Quran. O Allah, give security protect his 
<A NAME="133"></A>son.
<A NAME="134"></A><BR><BR>Verily the world is happy through him; may his happiness endure 
<A NAME="135"></A>for
<A NAME="136"></A><BR>ever
<A NAME="137"></A><BR>And may the Lord strengthen him and with the banners of 
<A NAME="138"></A>victory.
<A NAME="139"></A><BR>Thus the branch will flourish of which he is the 
<A NAME="140"></A>root
<A NAME="141"></A><BR>Because the beauty of the earth's plants depends on the virtue 
<A NAME="142"></A>of
<A NAME="143"></A><BR>the seed.
<A NAME="144"></A><BR><BR>May God, whose name be exalted and hallowed, keep in security and 
<A NAME="145"></A>peace the pure country of Shiraz until the time of the resurrection, under 
<A NAME="146"></A>the authority of righteous governors and by the exertions of practical 
<A NAME="147"></A>scholars.
<A NAME="148"></A><BR><BR>Knowest thou not why I in foreign countries
<A NAME="149"></A><BR>Roamed about for a long time?
<A NAME="150"></A><BR>I went away from the distress of the Turks because I 
<A NAME="151"></A>saw
<A NAME="152"></A><BR>The world entangled like the hair of negroes;
<A NAME="153"></A><BR>They were all human beings, but
<A NAME="154"></A><BR>Like wolves sharp-clawed, for shedding blood.
<A NAME="155"></A><BR>When I returned I saw the country at rest,
<A NAME="156"></A><BR>The tigers having abandoned the nature of tigers.
<A NAME="157"></A><BR>Within a man of good disposition like an angel,
<A NAME="158"></A><BR>Without an army like bellicose lions.
<A NAME="159"></A><BR>Thus it happened that first I beheld
<A NAME="160"></A><BR>The world full of confusion, anxiety and distress;
<A NAME="161"></A><BR>Then it became as it is in the days of the just 
<A NAME="162"></A>Sultan
<A NAME="163"></A><BR>Atabek Abu Bekr Ben Sa'd Zanki.
<A NAME="164"></A><BR><BR>The country of Pares dreads not the vicissitudes of 
<A NAME="165"></A>time,
<A NAME="166"></A><BR>As long as one presides over it like thee, the shadow of 
<A NAME="167"></A>God.
<A NAME="168"></A><BR>Today no one can point out on the surface of the 
<A NAME="169"></A>earth,
<A NAME="170"></A><BR>A place like the threshold of thy door, the asylum of 
<A NAME="171"></A>comfort.
<A NAME="172"></A><BR>On thee is incumbent the protection of the distressed 
<A NAME="173"></A>and
<A NAME="174"></A><BR>gratitude
<A NAME="175"></A><BR>Upon us and reward on God the creator of the world,
<A NAME="176"></A><BR>As long as the world and wind endure.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="177"></A><B>The Cause for Composing the Gulistan</B>

<A NAME="178"></A><BR><BR>I was one night meditating on the time which had elapsed, repenting 
<A NAME="179"></A>of the life I had squandered and perforating the stony mansion of my heart 
<A NAME="180"></A>with adamantine tears. 1 I uttered the following verses in conformity with 
<A NAME="181"></A>the state of mind:
<A NAME="182"></A><BR><BR>Every moment a breath of life is spent,
<A NAME="183"></A><BR>If I consider, not much of it remains.
<A NAME="184"></A><BR>O thou, whose fifty years have elapsed in sleep,
<A NAME="185"></A><BR>Wilt thou perhaps overtake them in these five days?
<A NAME="186"></A><BR>Shame on him who has gone and done no work.
<A NAME="187"></A><BR>The drum of departure was beaten but he has not made his 
<A NAME="188"></A>load.
<A NAME="189"></A><BR><BR>Sweet sleep on the morning of departure
<A NAME="190"></A><BR>Retains the pedestrian from the road.
<A NAME="191"></A><BR>Whoever had come had built a new edifice.
<A NAME="192"></A><BR>He departed and left the place to another
<A NAME="193"></A><BR>And that other one concocted the same futile schemes
<A NAME="194"></A><BR>And this edifice was not completed by anyone.
<A NAME="195"></A><BR>Cherish not an inconstant friend.
<A NAME="196"></A><BR>Such a traitor is not fit for amity.
<A NAME="197"></A><BR>As all the good and bad must surely die,
<A NAME="198"></A><BR>He is happy who carries off the ball of virtue.
<A NAME="199"></A><BR>Send provision for thy journey to thy tomb.
<A NAME="200"></A><BR>Nobody will bring it after thee; send it before.
<A NAME="201"></A><BR>Life is snow, the sun is melting hot.
<A NAME="202"></A><BR>Little remains, but the gentleman is slothful still.
<A NAME="203"></A><BR>O thou who hast gone empty handed to the bazar,
<A NAME="204"></A><BR>I fear thou wilt not bring a towel filled.
<A NAME="205"></A><BR>Who eats the corn he has sown while it is yet green,
<A NAME="206"></A><BR>Must at harvest time glean the ears of it.
<A NAME="207"></A><BR>Listen with all thy heart to the advice of Sa'di.
<A NAME="208"></A><BR>Such is the way; be a man and travel on.
<A NAME="209"></A><BR><BR>The capital of man's life is his abdomen.
<A NAME="210"></A><BR>If it be gradually emptied there is no fear
<A NAME="211"></A><BR>But if it be so closed as not to open
<A NAME="212"></A><BR>The heart may well despair of life;
<A NAME="213"></A><BR>And if it be open so that it cannot be closed,
<A NAME="214"></A><BR>Go and wash thy hands of this world's life.
<A NAME="215"></A><BR>Four contending rebellious dispositions
<A NAME="216"></A><BR>Harmonize but five days with each other.
<A NAME="217"></A><BR>If one of these four becomes prevalent,
<A NAME="218"></A><BR>Sweet life must abandon the body
<A NAME="219"></A><BR>Wherefore an intelligent and perfect man
<A NAME="220"></A><BR>Sets not his heart upon this world's life.
<A NAME="221"></A><BR><BR>After maturely considering these sentiments, I thought proper to 
<A NAME="222"></A>sit down in the mansion of retirement to fold up the skirts of association, 
<A NAME="223"></A>to wash my tablets of heedless sayings and no more to indulge in senseless 
<A NAME="224"></A>prattle:
<A NAME="225"></A><BR><BR>To sit in a corner, like one with a cut tongue, deaf and 
<A NAME="226"></A>dumb,
<A NAME="227"></A><BR>Is better than a man who has no command over his 
<A NAME="228"></A>tongue.
<A NAME="229"></A><BR><BR>I continued in this resolution till a friend, who had been my companion 
<A NAME="230"></A>in the camel-litter of misery and my comrade in the closet of affection, 
<A NAME="231"></A>entered at the door, according to his old custom with playful gladness, 
<A NAME="232"></A>and spread out the surface of desire; but I would give him no reply nor 
<A NAME="233"></A>lift up my head from the knees of worship. He looked at me aggrieved and 
<A NAME="234"></A>said:
<A NAME="235"></A><BR><BR>'Now, while thou hast the power of utterance,
<A NAME="236"></A><BR>Speak, O brother, with grace and kindness
<A NAME="237"></A><BR>Because tomorrow, when the messenger of death arrives,
<A NAME="238"></A><BR>Thou wilt of necessity restrain thy tongue.'
<A NAME="239"></A><BR><BR>One of my connections informed him how matters stood and told him 
<A NAME="240"></A>that I had firmly determined and was intent upon spending the rest of my 
<A NAME="241"></A>life in continual devotion and silence, advising him at the same time, 
<A NAME="242"></A>in case he should be able, to follow my example and to keep me company. 
<A NAME="243"></A>He replied: 'I swear by the great dignity of Allah and by our old friendship 
<A NAME="244"></A>that I shall not draw breath, nor budge one step, unless he converses with 
<A NAME="245"></A>me as formerly, and in his usual way; because it is foolish to insult friends 
<A NAME="246"></A>and easy to expiate an oath. It is against propriety, and contrary to the 
<A NAME="247"></A>opinions of wise men that the Zulfiqar of A'li should remain in the scabbard 
<A NAME="248"></A>and the tongue of Sa'di in his palate.'
<A NAME="249"></A><BR><BR>O intelligent man what is the tongue in the 
<A NAME="250"></A>mouth?
<A NAME="251"></A><BR>It is the key to the treasure-door of a virtuous 
<A NAME="252"></A>man.
<A NAME="253"></A><BR>When the door is closed how can one know
<A NAME="254"></A><BR>Whether he is a seller of jewels or a hawker?
<A NAME="255"></A><BR><BR>Although intelligent men consider silence civil,
<A NAME="256"></A><BR>It is better for thee to speak at the proper time.
<A NAME="257"></A><BR>Two things betoken levity of intellect: to remain 
<A NAME="258"></A>mute
<A NAME="259"></A><BR>When it is proper to speak and to talk when silence 
<A NAME="260"></A>is
<A NAME="261"></A><BR>required.
<A NAME="262"></A><BR><BR>In short, I had not the firmness to restrain my tongue from speaking 
<A NAME="263"></A>to him, and did not consider it polite to turn away my face from his conversation, 
<A NAME="264"></A>he being a congenial friend and sincerely affectionate.
<A NAME="265"></A><BR><BR>When thou fightest with anyone, consider
<A NAME="266"></A><BR>Whether thou wilt have to flee from him or he from 
<A NAME="267"></A>thee.
<A NAME="268"></A><BR><BR>I was under the necessity of speaking and then went out by way 
<A NAME="269"></A>of diversion in the vernal season, when the traces of severe cold had disappeared 
<A NAME="270"></A>and the time of the dominion of roses had arrived:
<A NAME="271"></A><BR><BR>Green garments were upon the trees
<A NAME="272"></A><BR>Like holiday robes on contented persons.
<A NAME="273"></A><BR>On the first of the month Ardibihesht Jellali
<A NAME="274"></A><BR>The bulbuls were singing on the pulpits of branches.
<A NAME="275"></A><BR>Upon the roses pearls of dew had fallen,
<A NAME="276"></A><BR>Resembling perspiration on an angry sweetheart's 
<A NAME="277"></A>cheek.
<A NAME="278"></A><BR><BR>I happened to spend the night in a garden with one of my friends 
<A NAME="279"></A>and we found it to be a pleasant cheerful place with heart-ravishing entangled 
<A NAME="280"></A>trees; its ground seemed to be paved with small glass beads whilst, from 
<A NAME="281"></A>its vines, bunches like the Pleiads were suspended.
<A NAME="282"></A><BR><BR>A garden the water of whose river was limpid
<A NAME="283"></A><BR>A grove the melody of whose birds was harmonious.
<A NAME="284"></A><BR><BR>The former full of bright-coloured tulips,
<A NAME="285"></A><BR>The latter full of fruits of various kinds;
<A NAME="286"></A><BR>The wind had in the shade of its trees
<A NAME="287"></A><BR>Spread out a bed of all kinds of flowers.
<A NAME="288"></A><BR><BR>The next morning when the intention of returning had prevailed 
<A NAME="289"></A>over the opinion of tarrying, I saw that my friend had in his skirt collected 
<A NAME="290"></A>roses, sweet basil, hyacinths and fragrant herbs with the determination 
<A NAME="291"></A>to carry them to town; whereon I said: 'Thou knowest that the roses of 
<A NAME="292"></A>the garden are perishable and the season passes away', and philosophers 
<A NAME="293"></A>have said: 'Whatever is not of long duration is not to be cherished.' He 
<A NAME="294"></A>asked: 'Then what is to be done?' I replied: 'I may compose for the amusement 
<A NAME="295"></A>of those who look and for the instruction of those who are present a book 
<A NAME="296"></A>of a Rose Garden, a Gulistan, whose leaves cannot be touched by the tyranny 
<A NAME="297"></A>of autumnal blasts and the delight of whose spring the vicissitudes of 
<A NAME="298"></A>time will be unable to change into the inconstancy of 
<A NAME="299"></A>autumn.
<A NAME="300"></A><BR><BR>Of what use will be a dish of roses to thee?
<A NAME="301"></A><BR>Take a leaf from my rose-garden.
<A NAME="302"></A><BR>A flower endures but five or six days
<A NAME="303"></A><BR>But this rose-garden is always delightful.
<A NAME="304"></A><BR><BR>After I had uttered these words he threw away the flowers from 
<A NAME="305"></A>his skirts, and attached himself to mine, saying: 'When a generous fellow 
<A NAME="306"></A>makes a promise he keeps it.'
<A NAME="307"></A><BR><BR>On the same day I happened to write two chapters, namely on polite 
<A NAME="308"></A>society and the rules of conversation, in a style acceptable to orators 
<A NAME="309"></A>and instructive to letter-writers. In short, some roses of the garden still 
<A NAME="310"></A>remained when the book of the Rose-garden was finished but it will in reality 
<A NAME="311"></A>be completed only after approbation in the court of the Shah, who is the 
<A NAME="312"></A>refuge of the world, the shadow of God, the ray of his grace, the treasury 
<A NAME="313"></A>of the age, the asylum of the Faith, strengthened by heaven, aided against 
<A NAME="314"></A>enemies, the arm of the victorious government, the lamp of the resplendent 
<A NAME="315"></A>religion, the beauty of mankind, the boast of Islam, Sa'd son of Atabek 
<A NAME="316"></A>the great, the majestic Shahanshah, owner of the necks of nations, lord 
<A NAME="317"></A>of the kings of Arabia and Persia, the sultan of the land and the sea, 
<A NAME="318"></A>the heir of the kingdom of Solomon, Muzaffaruddin Ibu Bekr, son of Sa'd 
<A NAME="319"></A>Zanki, may Allah the most high perpetuate the prosperity of them both and 
<A NAME="320"></A>direct their inclinations to every good thing.
<A NAME="321"></A><BR><BR>Perused with a kind glance,
<A NAME="322"></A><BR>Adorned with approbation by the sovereign,
<A NAME="323"></A><BR>It will be a Chinese picture-gallery or design of the 
<A NAME="324"></A>Arzank,
<A NAME="325"></A><BR>Hopes are entertained that he will not be wearied
<A NAME="326"></A><BR>By these contents because a Pose-garden is not a place 
<A NAME="327"></A>of
<A NAME="328"></A><BR>displeasure.
<A NAME="329"></A><BR>The more so as its august preface is dedicated
<A NAME="330"></A><BR>To Sa'd Abu Bekr Sa'd the son of Zanki.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="331"></A><B>Record of the Great Amir Fakhruddin Ben Abu Bekr, Son of Abu 
<A NAME="332"></A>Nassar</B>

<A NAME="333"></A><BR><BR>Again, the bride of imagination can for want of beauty not lift 
<A NAME="334"></A>up her head nor raise her eyes from the feet of bashfulness to appear in 
<A NAME="335"></A>the assembly of persons endowed with pulchritude, unless adorned with the 
<A NAME="336"></A>ornaments of approbation from the great Amir, who is learned, just, aided 
<A NAME="337"></A>by heaven, victorious, supporter of the throne of the Sultanate and councillor 
<A NAME="338"></A>in deliberations of the realm, refuge of the poor, asylum of strangers, 
<A NAME="339"></A>patron of learned men, lover of the pious, glory of the dynasty of Pares, 
<A NAME="340"></A>right hand of the kingdom, chief of the nobles, boast of the monarchy and 
<A NAME="341"></A>of the religion, succour of Islam and of the Musalmans, buttress of kings 
<A NAME="342"></A>and sultans, Abu Bekr, son of Abu Nassar, may Allah prolong his life, augment 
<A NAME="343"></A>his dignity, enlighten his breast and increase his reward twofold, because 
<A NAME="344"></A>he enjoys the praise of all great men and is the embodiment of every laudable 
<A NAME="345"></A>quality.
<A NAME="346"></A><BR><BR>Whoever reposes in the shadow of his favour,
<A NAME="347"></A><BR>His sin is transmuted to obedience and his foe into a 
<A NAME="348"></A>friend.
<A NAME="349"></A><BR><BR>Every attendant and follower has an appointed duty and if, in the 
<A NAME="350"></A>performance thereof, he gives way to remissness and indolence, he is certainly 
<A NAME="351"></A>called to account and becomes subject to reproaches, except the tribe of 
<A NAME="352"></A>dervishes, from whom thanks are due for the benefits they receive from 
<A NAME="353"></A>great men as well as praises and prayers, all of which duties are more 
<A NAME="354"></A>suitably performed in their absence than in their presence, because in 
<A NAME="355"></A>the latter they look like ostentation and in the former they are free from 
<A NAME="356"></A>ceremony.
<A NAME="357"></A><BR><BR>The back of the bent sky became flat with joy,
<A NAME="358"></A><BR>When dame nature brought forth a child like thee.
<A NAME="359"></A><BR>It is an instance of wisdom if the Creator
<A NAME="360"></A><BR>Causes a servant to make the general welfare his special 
<A NAME="361"></A>duty.
<A NAME="362"></A><BR>He has found eternal happiness who lived a good 
<A NAME="363"></A>life,
<A NAME="364"></A><BR>Because, after his end, good repute will keep his name 
<A NAME="365"></A>alive.
<A NAME="366"></A><BR>No matter whether virtuous men praise you or not
<A NAME="367"></A><BR>A lovely maid stands in no need of a tire woman.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="368"></A><B>Excuse for Remissness in Service and Cause for Preferring 
<A NAME="369"></A>Solitude</B>

<A NAME="370"></A><BR><BR>My negligence and backwardness in diligent attendance at the royal 
<A NAME="371"></A>court resemble the case of Barzachumihr, whose merits the sages of India 
<A NAME="372"></A>were discussing but could at last not reproach him with anything except 
<A NAME="373"></A>slowness of speech because he delayed long and his hearers were obliged 
<A NAME="374"></A>to wait till he delivered himself of what he had to say. When Barzachumihr 
<A NAME="375"></A>heard of this he said: 'It is better for me to consider what to speak than 
<A NAME="376"></A>to repent of what I have spoken.'
<A NAME="377"></A><BR><BR>A trained orator, old, aged,
<A NAME="378"></A><BR>First meditates and then speaks.
<A NAME="379"></A><BR>Do not speak without consideration.
<A NAME="380"></A><BR>Speak well and if slow what matters it?
<A NAME="381"></A><BR>Deliberate and then begin to talk.
<A NAME="382"></A><BR>Say thyself enough before others say enough.
<A NAME="383"></A><BR>By speech a man is better than a brute
<A NAME="384"></A><BR>But a beast is better unless thou speakest properly.
<A NAME="385"></A><BR><BR>How then could I venture to appear in the sight of the grandees 
<A NAME="386"></A>of my lord, may his victory be glorious, who are an assembly of pious men 
<A NAME="387"></A>and the centre of profound scholars? If I were to be led in the ardour 
<A NAME="388"></A>of conversation to speak petulantly, I could produce only a trifling stock-in-trade 
<A NAME="389"></A>in the noble presence but glass beads are not worth a barleycorn in the 
<A NAME="390"></A>bazar of jewellers, a lamp does not shine in the presence of the sun, and 
<A NAME="391"></A>a minaret looks low at the foot of Mount Alvend.
<A NAME="392"></A><BR><BR>Who lifts up his neck with pretentions,
<A NAME="393"></A><BR>Foes hasten to him from every side.
<A NAME="394"></A><BR>Sa'di has fallen to be a hermit.
<A NAME="395"></A><BR>No one came to attack a fallen man.
<A NAME="396"></A><BR>First deliberation, then speech;
<A NAME="397"></A><BR>The foundation was laid first, then the wall.
<A NAME="398"></A><BR><BR>I know bouquet-binding but not in the garden. I sell a sweetheart 
<A NAME="399"></A>but not in Canaan. Loqman the philosopher, being asked from whom he had 
<A NAME="400"></A>learnt wisdom, replied: 'From the blind, who do not take a step before 
<A NAME="401"></A>trying the place.' First move about, then stir out.
<A NAME="402"></A><BR><BR>Try thy virility first, then marry.
<A NAME="403"></A><BR>Though a cock may be brave in war
<A NAME="404"></A><BR>He strikes his claws in vain on a brazen falcon.
<A NAME="405"></A><BR>A cat is a lion in catching mice
<A NAME="406"></A><BR>But a mouse in combat with a tiger.
<A NAME="407"></A><BR><BR>But, trusting in the liberal sentiments of the great, who shut 
<A NAME="408"></A>their eyes to the faults of their inferiors and abstain from divulging 
<A NAME="409"></A>the crimes of humble men, we have in this book recorded, by way of abridgment, 
<A NAME="410"></A>some rare events, stories, poetry and accounts about ancient kings, spending 
<A NAME="411"></A>a portion of our precious life in the task. This was the reason for composing 
<A NAME="412"></A>the book Gulistan; and help is from Allah.
<A NAME="413"></A><BR><BR>This well-arranged composition will remain for 
<A NAME="414"></A>years,
<A NAME="415"></A><BR>When every atom of our dust is dispersed.
<A NAME="416"></A><BR>The intention of this design was that it should 
<A NAME="417"></A>survive
<A NAME="418"></A><BR>Because I perceive no stability in my existence,
<A NAME="419"></A><BR>Unless one day a pious man compassionately
<A NAME="420"></A><BR>Utters a prayer for the works of dervishes.
<A NAME="421"></A><BR><BR>The author, having deliberated upon the arrangement of the book, 
<A NAME="422"></A>and the adornment of the chapters, deemed it suitable to curtail the diction 
<A NAME="423"></A>of this beautiful garden and luxuriant grove and to make it resemble paradise, 
<A NAME="424"></A>which also has eight entrances. The abridgment was made to avoid 
<A NAME="425"></A>tediousness.
<A NAME="426"></A><BR><BR>I The Manners of Kings
<A NAME="427"></A><BR>II On the Morals of Dervishes
<A NAME="428"></A><BR>III On the Excellence of Content
<A NAME="429"></A><BR>IV On the Advantages of Silence
<A NAME="430"></A><BR>V On Love and Youth
<A NAME="431"></A><BR>VI On Weakness and Old Age
<A NAME="432"></A><BR>VII On the Effects of Education
<A NAME="433"></A><BR>VIII On Rules for Conduct in Life
<A NAME="434"></A><BR><BR>At a period when our time was pleasant
<A NAME="435"></A><BR>The Hejret was six hundred and fifty-six.
<A NAME="436"></A><BR>Our intention was advice and we gave it.
<A NAME="437"></A><BR>We recommended thee to God and departed.
