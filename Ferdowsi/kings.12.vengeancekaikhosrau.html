<A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A>Dire was the wailing among the army of Iran at their sore defeat, and they 
<A NAME="11"></A>turned them back discomfited. And they came before the Shah, their hearts 
<A NAME="12"></A>torn with anguish. And their hands were crossed upon their breasts, and 
<A NAME="13"></A>they were humble as slaves. And Kai Khosrau was angry when he beheld them, 
<A NAME="14"></A>and he remembered Firoud, and he railed against Tus, from whom was sprung 
<A NAME="15"></A>this evil. And he said-
<A NAME="16"></A><BR><BR>"Cursed be he and his elephants and his cymbals." And the Shah 
<A NAME="17"></A>withdrew from his courts, and he withheld his countenance from the land. 
<A NAME="18"></A>So the nobles went out unto Rustem, and entreated of him that he would 
<A NAME="19"></A>intercede for them with the Shah. And Rustem did as they desired, and he 
<A NAME="20"></A>pleaded for the army and its leaders, and he spake good even of Tus. And 
<A NAME="21"></A>Kai Khosrau inclined his ear unto his Pehliva, and he let the light of 
<A NAME="22"></A>his countenance shine again upon his army, and he confided unto Tus once 
<A NAME="23"></A>more the standard of Kawah, but he made Gew march beside him and restrain 
<A NAME="24"></A>his haste.
<A NAME="25"></A><BR><BR>So they set forth again unto Turan, and Afrasiyab, when he learned 
<A NAME="26"></A>of their approach, made ready his army also. And there were joined unto 
<A NAME="27"></A>him the hosts of the Khakan of China, and of the Kamous of Kushan, men 
<A NAME="28"></A>mighty in the battlefield. And from Ind and all the highlands of Asia there 
<A NAME="29"></A>came forth troops unto the aid of Afrasiyab, King of Turan. And he rejoiced 
<A NAME="30"></A>thereat, for he was assured that if Rustem came not forth to aid them, 
<A NAME="31"></A>the men of Iran could not stand against his host.
<A NAME="32"></A><BR><BR>Now when the two armies met, many and fierce were the combats waged 
<A NAME="33"></A>between them, and blows were given and received, and swords flashed and 
<A NAME="34"></A>showers of arrows descended on all sides. And the blood of brave men was 
<A NAME="35"></A>shed like unto the shedding of rain from a black cloud. And day by day 
<A NAME="36"></A>were the Iranians weakened, for they were smitten with great slaughter, 
<A NAME="37"></A>and the number of their dead was past the counting. But Afrasiyab rejoiced 
<A NAME="38"></A>in his victory, and his heart shouted within him when he learned after 
<A NAME="39"></A>many days that the Iranians were drawn back into the mountains. But Kai 
<A NAME="40"></A>Khosrau, when he learned it, was afflicted, and wept sore. Then he sent 
<A NAME="41"></A>greeting unto Rustem, his Pehliva, and he craved of him that he would come 
<A NAME="42"></A>forth to aid the army, for in him alone could he put his trust. And Rustem 
<A NAME="43"></A>said-
<A NAME="44"></A><BR><BR>"O Shah, since the day that mine arm could wield a mace, I have 
<A NAME="45"></A>ever fought the battles of Iran, and it would seem that rest may never 
<A NAME="46"></A>come nigh unto me. Yet since I am thy slave, it behoveth me to obey. I 
<A NAME="47"></A>am ready to do thy desires."
<A NAME="48"></A><BR><BR>So he made ready an host to go unto the succour of Iran. And while 
<A NAME="49"></A>he did so the army was defeated yet again, and all heart went from the 
<A NAME="50"></A>Iranians, and they would have given them over unto their foes. But while 
<A NAME="51"></A>they pondered it, there came tidings unto Gudarz that Rustem was drawing 
<A NAME="52"></A>nigh. Yet they feared to give way unto belief. But Piran when he heard 
<A NAME="53"></A>it was sore discomfited, for he remembered of old the might of Rustem, 
<A NAME="54"></A>and he knew that none could stand before it. But the Khakan and the Kamous 
<A NAME="55"></A>scoffed at his fears, and they made loud boastings that Rustem should fall 
<A NAME="56"></A>by their hands.
<A NAME="57"></A><BR><BR>Now when some days had passed in this disquietude, it came about 
<A NAME="58"></A>one night that, when the moon showed her face above the mountains, like 
<A NAME="59"></A>unto a victorious king seated upon a throne of turquoise, a watchman of 
<A NAME="60"></A>Iran set up a great cry. And he said-
<A NAME="61"></A><BR><BR>"The plain is filled with dust, and the night resoundeth with noise. 
<A NAME="62"></A>And I behold a mighty army drawing nigh, and they bear torches, and in 
<A NAME="63"></A>their midst rideth Rustem the mighty."
<A NAME="64"></A><BR><BR>When the men of Iran heard this, they set up a great shout, and 
<A NAME="65"></A>their hearts seemed to come back into their bodies, and their courage, 
<A NAME="66"></A>that had been as dead, returned. And glad was the greeting that they gave 
<A NAME="67"></A>unto Rustem the Pehliva. And Rustem mustered them and put them into battle 
<A NAME="68"></A>order, and when the sun had wearied of the black veil, and had torn the 
<A NAME="69"></A>night asunder, and reappeared unto the world, the men of Iran called upon 
<A NAME="70"></A>the host of Turan to come forth in combat. And they defied them unto battle, 
<A NAME="71"></A>and they fought with new valour, and they made great havoc in their ranks. 
<A NAME="72"></A>And when the evening was come, the day belonged unto 
<A NAME="73"></A>Iran.
<A NAME="74"></A><BR><BR>Then Piran called before him Human the brave, and said unto 
<A NAME="75"></A>him-
<A NAME="76"></A><BR>"The nobles of Iran have found again their courage, since an army is 
<A NAME="77"></A>come to their aid. Yet I would know if Rustem be their leader, for him 
<A NAME="78"></A>alone do I fear."
<A NAME="79"></A><BR><BR>And when he learned it his spirit was troubled. But the Kamous 
<A NAME="80"></A>mocked him, and sware a great oath that, ere the sun should be set once 
<A NAME="81"></A>more, he would have broken the might of Rustem. For he 
<A NAME="82"></A>said-
<A NAME="83"></A><BR><BR>"There is none, not even a mad elephant, that is mine equal in 
<A NAME="84"></A>the fight."
<A NAME="85"></A><BR><BR>So when the day was come, the Kamous challenged Rustem unto single 
<A NAME="86"></A>combat. And Rustem strode forth from the camp, and the Kamous met him upon 
<A NAME="87"></A>the plain. Then they struggled sore, and wrestled one with another, but 
<A NAME="88"></A>in the end Rustem caught the Kamous in the meshes of his cord. And he showed 
<A NAME="89"></A>him unto the army, and he asked of them, saying-
<A NAME="90"></A><BR><BR>"What death desire ye that the Kamous should die, for his hour 
<A NAME="91"></A>is come?"
<A NAME="92"></A><BR><BR>Then he threw him among the nobles, and they made an end of him 
<A NAME="93"></A>with their spears, and they flung his body to the vultures.
<A NAME="94"></A><BR><BR>Now when the Khakan heard of the death of the Kamous, he sware 
<A NAME="95"></A>that he would avenge him, and he sent forth a messenger to defy Rustem. 
<A NAME="96"></A>But Rustem said unto the messenger-
<A NAME="97"></A><BR><BR>"I seek no quarrel with the Khakan, and in all your army I desire 
<A NAME="98"></A>only to look upon the face of Piran. And I beg of him that he will come 
<A NAME="99"></A>forth to greet me, for my heart burneth towards him, because he was afflicted 
<A NAME="100"></A>for the death of Saiawush, my foster-son, and because of the good he did 
<A NAME="101"></A>unto Kai Khosrau and unto his mother."
<A NAME="102"></A><BR><BR>So the messenger bare these words unto Piran. And Piran, when he 
<A NAME="103"></A>had taken counsel, listened unto the desires of Rustem, and came into his 
<A NAME="104"></A>tents. And he said-
<A NAME="105"></A><BR><BR>"I am Piran, leader of the hosts of Turan. Speak unto me thy 
<A NAME="106"></A>name."
<A NAME="107"></A><BR><BR>And Rustem said, "I am Rustem of Zaboulistan, and I am armed with 
<A NAME="108"></A>a mace and a sword of Cabul."
<A NAME="109"></A><BR><BR>Then he gave him greeting from Kai Khosrau, and he lauded him for 
<A NAME="110"></A>the good deeds that he had done unto Saiawush and to his son, and he entreated 
<A NAME="111"></A>him that he would turn away from Afrasiyab, and go with him unto Kai Khosrau. 
<A NAME="112"></A>And he said-
<A NAME="113"></A><BR><BR>"Iran desireth not to destroy the innocent. Therefore deliver over 
<A NAME="114"></A>unto me the men upon whose head resteth the blood of Saiawush, and we will 
<A NAME="115"></A>withdraw our hosts, and there shall be peace in the 
<A NAME="116"></A>land."
<A NAME="117"></A><BR><BR>Then Piran said, "That which thou askest, verily it can never be, 
<A NAME="118"></A>for the slayers of Saiawush are near kinsfolk unto Afrasiyab. And because 
<A NAME="119"></A>he hath named me the leader of his hosts, it may not be that I abandon 
<A NAME="120"></A>them. But I say unto thee, that it would be sweeter unto me to die than 
<A NAME="121"></A>to conduct this warfare, and that my heart is torn because I must lift 
<A NAME="122"></A>up the sword of enmity against Kai Khosrau, my son."
<A NAME="123"></A><BR><BR>And Rustem saw that the words that Piran spake were true, and he 
<A NAME="124"></A>sorrowed for him. And when they parted it was in friendship, although they 
<A NAME="125"></A>knew that battle must rage between them. Then they drew up their armies, 
<A NAME="126"></A>and for forty days there was waged a battle, mighty and terrible. And great 
<A NAME="127"></A>ravages were committed, and Rustem did deeds of valour, and the strong 
<A NAME="128"></A>and the weak were alike impotent before him. And the plains were strewn 
<A NAME="129"></A>with the bodies of the slain, until that an ant could not have found a 
<A NAME="130"></A>road to pass between them, and the blood of the wounded streamed on all 
<A NAME="131"></A>sides, and heads without bodies and bodies without heads covered the ground. 
<A NAME="132"></A>For neither the claw of the leopard nor the trunk of the elephant, neither 
<A NAME="133"></A>the high mountains nor the waters of the earth, could prevail against Rustem 
<A NAME="134"></A>when he fought at the head of his hosts. And he slew the mightiest among 
<A NAME="135"></A>the Turanians, and only Piran was he mindful to spare. And the Khakan of 
<A NAME="136"></A>China was enmeshed in his cord, and he sent him bound unto Kai Khosrau 
<A NAME="137"></A>with news of the victory. And when the Turanians fled before his face, 
<A NAME="138"></A>he followed after them and pursued them unto the mountains.
<A NAME="139"></A><BR><BR>Then Piran made haste to come before Afrasiyab, and he spake to 
<A NAME="140"></A>him and said-
<A NAME="141"></A><BR><BR>"The land is changed into a sea of blood, for Rustem is come forth, 
<A NAME="142"></A>and who can stand against him? And he followeth after me close. Wherefore 
<A NAME="143"></A>I counsel thee, flee; for how canst thou stand alone against him? Alas 
<A NAME="144"></A>for the woe that thou hast brought upon Turan! Thou hast wounded our hearts 
<A NAME="145"></A>with the iron of the arrow wherewith thou didst slay Saiawush the 
<A NAME="146"></A>noble."
<A NAME="147"></A><BR><BR>Then he urged upon him that he tarry not. So Afrasiyab fled from 
<A NAME="148"></A>before the face of Rustem and hid himself in the mountains. And when Rustem 
<A NAME="149"></A>came into his courts and found that the King was fled, he seized upon much 
<A NAME="150"></A>booty and divided it among his men, and he feasted them many days in the 
<A NAME="151"></A>house of Afrasiyab, and he suffered them to enjoy repose. Then he destroyed 
<A NAME="152"></A>with fire the palace, and when he had done so he turned him to go back 
<A NAME="153"></A>unto Kai Khosrau.
<A NAME="154"></A><BR><BR>Now when he was come within the city of the Shah, glad cries rang 
<A NAME="155"></A>through all the air, and the sound of drums filled the land of Iran, and 
<A NAME="156"></A>there was joy throughout its breadth because the destroyer of Turan was 
<A NAME="157"></A>returned. And the heart of Kai Khosrau rejoiced like a paradise, and he 
<A NAME="158"></A>came out to meet his Pehliva mounted upon an elephant gaily caparisoned, 
<A NAME="159"></A>and music and singers went before him. And he invited him to a great feast, 
<A NAME="160"></A>and he poured rich gifts upon him. And for a month Rustem abode in the 
<A NAME="161"></A>presence of his Shah, making merry with wine. And the singers chanted of 
<A NAME="162"></A>his great deeds, and the sounds of flutes and stringed instruments went 
<A NAME="163"></A>with their words. But when that time was over Rustem asked of Kai Khosrau 
<A NAME="164"></A>that he would suffer him to return unto Zal his father, for his heart yearned 
<A NAME="165"></A>to look upon his face. And Kai Khosrau suffered it.
<A NAME="166"></A><BR><BR>Now Rustem was not returned long unto Zaboulistan before there 
<A NAME="167"></A>came into the courts of the Shah a shepherd who desired to speak with Kai 
<A NAME="168"></A>Khosrau. And the Shah granted his request, and the man opened his mouth 
<A NAME="169"></A>before him, and he said-
<A NAME="170"></A><BR><BR>"A wild ass is broken in among my horses, and he doeth great mischief, 
<A NAME="171"></A>for his breath is like unto a lion. Send forth, therefore, I entreat of 
<A NAME="172"></A>thee, O King of Kings, a warrior of thine host that he may slay 
<A NAME="173"></A>him."
<A NAME="174"></A><BR><BR>Now Kai Khosrau, when he had listened, knew that this was not a 
<A NAME="175"></A>wild ass but the Deev Akwan, who had taken this disguise upon him. So he 
<A NAME="176"></A>cast about whom he should send forth to meet him, and he knew there was 
<A NAME="177"></A>none other but Rustem, the son of Zal, to whom he could turn in this strait. 
<A NAME="178"></A>So he sent a messenger swift as a cloud before a storm to summon him forth 
<A NAME="179"></A>yet again. And Rustem obeyed the voice of his Shah, and he set forth in 
<A NAME="180"></A>search of the Deev, and he was mounted upon Rakush his steed. And in his 
<A NAME="181"></A>hand was a mighty mace, and round his wrist was rolled a cord of length. 
<A NAME="182"></A>And he went in search of the wild ass, and when he had found him he threw 
<A NAME="183"></A>his cord about him. But the ass vanished under his hands. Then Rustem knew 
<A NAME="184"></A>that it was a Deev, and that he fought against the arts of magic. Yet was 
<A NAME="185"></A>he not dismayed. And after a while the ass came forth again, and Rustem 
<A NAME="186"></A>threw his cord once more about him. And yet again the Deev vanished under 
<A NAME="187"></A>his hand. And thus did the Deev three days and three nights without ceasing, 
<A NAME="188"></A>so that weariness came upon Rustem and he was heavy with slumber. So he 
<A NAME="189"></A>sought out a spot of safety and he laid him down to rest, and he bade Rakush 
<A NAME="190"></A>browse beside him.
<A NAME="191"></A><BR><BR>Now when the Deev saw that Rustem was sleeping, he drew nigh and 
<A NAME="192"></A>loosened the earth whereon he lay, and lifted it and placed it upon his 
<A NAME="193"></A>head, that he might cast it away and destroy Rustem. But as he carried 
<A NAME="194"></A>him Rustem awoke, and when he saw what was come to pass he feared that 
<A NAME="195"></A>his hour was come. And the Deev, when he beheld that Rustem was awakened, 
<A NAME="196"></A>spake, and said unto him-
<A NAME="197"></A><BR><BR>"O hero, which death dost thou covet? Shall I fling thee down upon 
<A NAME="198"></A>the mountain or cast thee into the sea?"
<A NAME="199"></A><BR><BR>Now Rustem knew that the Deev questioned him in wile, and he bethought 
<A NAME="200"></A>him that he would of a surety do that which Rustem desired not, so he 
<A NAME="201"></A>said-
<A NAME="202"></A><BR><BR>"I have heard it said that it is not given to those that perish 
<A NAME="203"></A>in the waters to look upon the face of the Serosch or to find rest in the 
<A NAME="204"></A>life that is beyond."
<A NAME="205"></A><BR><BR>Then the Deev said, "I desire that thou know not 
<A NAME="206"></A>repose."
<A NAME="207"></A><BR><BR>And he flung him into the sea at a spot where hungry crocodiles 
<A NAME="208"></A>would devour him.
<A NAME="209"></A><BR><BR>Now Rustem, when he felt the water beneath him, forthwith drew 
<A NAME="210"></A>out his sword and combated the crocodiles with his right hand, and with 
<A NAME="211"></A>his left he swam towards the shore. And long did he struggle and sore, 
<A NAME="212"></A>but when the night was fallen he put his foot upon the dry land. Then, 
<A NAME="213"></A>when he had given thanks unto God and rested him, he returned unto the 
<A NAME="214"></A>spot where he had found the Deev. And he sought after Rakush his steed, 
<A NAME="215"></A>and his eye beheld him not. Then fear filled his spirit, and he roamed 
<A NAME="216"></A>around to seek him. And he found him at last among the horses of Afrasiyab, 
<A NAME="217"></A>that grazed in a spot hard by, for the keepers had ensnared him. But when 
<A NAME="218"></A>Rakush heard the voice of Rustem he neighed aloud, and brake from the keepers 
<A NAME="219"></A>and ran towards his master. And Rustem put the saddle upon him and mounted 
<A NAME="220"></A>him. Then he slew the keepers and took their herds unto 
<A NAME="221"></A>himself.
<A NAME="222"></A><BR><BR>Now while he was so doing Afrasiyab came forth from his hiding-place, 
<A NAME="223"></A>for his heart yearned to look upon his horses. And when he beheld Rustem 
<A NAME="224"></A>in their midst he was dismayed, and knew not whither he should turn, for 
<A NAME="225"></A>he deemed that the Pehliva had discovered his hiding-place and was come 
<A NAME="226"></A>forth against him. So he offered battle unto him with the men that were 
<A NAME="227"></A>with him. And Rustem accepted the challenge, although he was alone; and 
<A NAME="228"></A>he fought with might and overcame the men, and slew sixty of them with 
<A NAME="229"></A>his sword and forty with his mace. And Afrasiyab fled once more from before 
<A NAME="230"></A>him.
<A NAME="231"></A><BR><BR>Now when it was done the Deev came forth again, for he thought 
<A NAME="232"></A>he could quell Rustem now that he was weary. But Rustem sprang on him and 
<A NAME="233"></A>crushed him, and he was slain at his hands. Then the Pehliva returned unto 
<A NAME="234"></A>Kai Khosrau. And when the Shah had learned of all his deeds, and beheld 
<A NAME="235"></A>the booty that he had brought back, his mouth could not cease from praising 
<A NAME="236"></A>the prowess of Rustem, and he would have kept his Pehliva beside him for 
<A NAME="237"></A>ever. But Rustem said-
<A NAME="238"></A><BR><BR>"Suffer thy servant to go forth. For I would make ready an host, 
<A NAME="239"></A>since it behoveth us not to cease from the vengeance that is due unto Saiawush, 
<A NAME="240"></A>for his murderers yet cumber the ground."
<A NAME="241"></A><BR><BR>Wherefore Rustem departed yet again from out the courts of the 
<A NAME="242"></A>Shah.
