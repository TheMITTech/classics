<A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A>Whilom the fancy seized upon the Shah of Iran that he would visit his empire, 
<A NAME="11"></A>and look face to face upon his vassals, and exact their tribute. So he 
<A NAME="12"></A>passed from Turan into China, and from Mikran into Berberistan. And wheresoever 
<A NAME="13"></A>he passed men did homage before him, for the bull cannot wage battle with 
<A NAME="14"></A>the lion. But it could not remain thus for ever, and already there sprang 
<A NAME="15"></A>forth thorns in the garden of roses. For while the fortunes of the world 
<A NAME="16"></A>thus prospered, a chieftain raised the standard of revolt in Egypt, and 
<A NAME="17"></A>the people of the land turned them from the gates of submission unto Iran. 
<A NAME="18"></A>And there was joined unto them the King of Hamaveran, who desired to throw 
<A NAME="19"></A>off the yoke of Persia. But Kai Kaous, when the tidings thereof came unto 
<A NAME="20"></A>him, got ready his army and marched against the rebels. And when he came 
<A NAME="21"></A>before them, their army, that had seemed invincible, was routed, and the 
<A NAME="22"></A>King of Hamaveran was foremost to lay down his arms and ask pardon of his 
<A NAME="23"></A>Shah. And Kai Kaous granted his petition, and the King departed joyously 
<A NAME="24"></A>from out his presence. Then one of those who stood about the Shah said 
<A NAME="25"></A>unto him-
<A NAME="26"></A><BR><BR>"Is it known to thee, O Shah, that this King hideth behind his 
<A NAME="27"></A>curtains a daughter of beauty? It would beseem my lord that he should take 
<A NAME="28"></A>this moon unto himself for wife."
<A NAME="29"></A><BR><BR>And Kai Kaous answered, "Thy counsel is good, and I will therefore 
<A NAME="30"></A>send messengers unto her father, and demand of him that he give me his 
<A NAME="31"></A>daughter as tribute, and to cement the peace that hath been made between 
<A NAME="32"></A>us."
<A NAME="33"></A><BR><BR>When the King of Hamaveran heard this message his heart was filled 
<A NAME="34"></A>with gall, and his head was heavy with sorrow, and he murmured in his spirit 
<A NAME="35"></A>that Kai Kaous, who owned the world, should desire to take from him his 
<A NAME="36"></A>chiefest treasure. And he hid not his grief from the Shah in his answer, 
<A NAME="37"></A>but he wrote also that he knew it behoved him to do the thing that Kai 
<A NAME="38"></A>Kaous desired. Then in his distress he called before him Sudaveh his daughter, 
<A NAME="39"></A>whom he loved, and he told her all his troubles, and bade her counsel him 
<A NAME="40"></A>how he should act. For he said-
<A NAME="41"></A><BR><BR>"If I lose thee, the light of my life is gone out. Yet how may 
<A NAME="42"></A>I stand against the Shah?"
<A NAME="43"></A><BR><BR>And Sudaveh replied, "If there be no remedy, I counsel thee to 
<A NAME="44"></A>rejoice at that which cannot be changed."
<A NAME="45"></A><BR><BR>Now when her father heard these words he knew that she was not 
<A NAME="46"></A>afflicted concerning that which was come about. So he sent for the envoy 
<A NAME="47"></A>of Kai Kaous and assented unto his demands, and they concluded an alliance 
<A NAME="48"></A>according to the forms of the land. Then when the King had poured gifts 
<A NAME="49"></A>before the messenger, and feasted him with wine, he sent forth an escort 
<A NAME="50"></A>to bear his daughter unto the tents of the Shah. And the young moon went 
<A NAME="51"></A>forth in a litter, and she was robed in garbs of splendour, and when Kai 
<A NAME="52"></A>Kaous beheld her loveliness he was struck dumb for very joy. Then he raised 
<A NAME="53"></A>Sudaveh unto the throne beside him, and named her worthy to be his spouse. 
<A NAME="54"></A>And they were glad in each other, and rejoiced; but all was not to be well 
<A NAME="55"></A>thus quickly.
<A NAME="56"></A><BR><BR>For the King of Hamaveran was sore in his heart that the light 
<A NAME="57"></A>of his life was gone from him, and he cast about in his spirit how he should 
<A NAME="58"></A>regain her unto himself. And when she had been gone but seven days, he 
<A NAME="59"></A>sent forth a messenger unto Kai Kaous and entreated him that he would come 
<A NAME="60"></A>and feast within his gates, so that all the land might rejoice in their 
<A NAME="61"></A>alliance.
<A NAME="62"></A><BR><BR>When Sudaveh heard this message her mind misgave her, and she feared 
<A NAME="63"></A>evil. Wherefore she counselled the Shah that he should abstain from this 
<A NAME="64"></A>feast. But Kai Kaous would not listen unto the fears of Sudaveh, he would 
<A NAME="65"></A>not give ear unto her warning. Wherefore he went forth unto the city of 
<A NAME="66"></A>the King of Hamaveran, and made merry with him many days. And the King 
<A NAME="67"></A>caused gifts to be rained down upon Kai Kaous, and he flattered him, and 
<A NAME="68"></A>cozened his vanity, and he made much of his men, and he darkened their 
<A NAME="69"></A>wits with fair words and sweet wine. Then when he had lulled their fears, 
<A NAME="70"></A>and caused them to forget wherefore and why and all knowledge of misfortune, 
<A NAME="71"></A>he fell upon them and bound them with strong chains, and overthrew their 
<A NAME="72"></A>glories and their thrones. And Kai Kaous did he send unto a fortress whose 
<A NAME="73"></A>head touched the sky and whose foot was planted in the ocean. Then he sent 
<A NAME="74"></A>forth a strong band into the camp of Iran, and veiled women went with them, 
<A NAME="75"></A>and he charged them that they bring back Sudaveh unto his 
<A NAME="76"></A>arms.
<A NAME="77"></A><BR><BR>Now when Sudaveh saw the men and the women that went with them 
<A NAME="78"></A>she guessed what was come about, and she cried aloud and tore her robes 
<A NAME="79"></A>in anguish. And when they had brought her before her father she reproved 
<A NAME="80"></A>him for his treachery, and she sware that none should part her from Kai 
<A NAME="81"></A>Kaous, even though he were hidden in a tomb. Then the King was angered 
<A NAME="82"></A>when he saw that her heart was taken from him and given to the Shah, and 
<A NAME="83"></A>he bade that she be flung into the same prison as her lord. And Sudaveh 
<A NAME="84"></A>was glad at his resolve, and she went into the dungeon with a light heart, 
<A NAME="85"></A>and she seated herself beside the Shah, and served him and comforted him, 
<A NAME="86"></A>and they bore the weight of captivity together.
<A NAME="87"></A><BR><BR>After these things were come about, the Iranians, because that 
<A NAME="88"></A>their Shah was held captive, returned unto Iran much discomfited. And when 
<A NAME="89"></A>the news spread that the throne was empty many would have seized thereon. 
<A NAME="90"></A>And Afrasiyab, when he learned it, straightway forgot hunger and sleep, 
<A NAME="91"></A>and marched a strong army across the border. And he laid waste the land 
<A NAME="92"></A>of Iran, and men, women, and children fell into bondage at his hands, and 
<A NAME="93"></A>the world was darkened unto the kingdom of light. Then some arose and went 
<A NAME="94"></A>before the son of Zal to crave his help in this sore need, saying unto 
<A NAME="95"></A>him-
<A NAME="96"></A><BR><BR>"Be thou our shield against misfortune, and deliver us from affliction, 
<A NAME="97"></A>for the glory of the Kaianides is vanished, and the land which was a paradise 
<A NAME="98"></A>is one no more."
<A NAME="99"></A><BR><BR>Now Rustem, when he heard the news, was grieved for the land, but 
<A NAME="100"></A>he was angered also against the Shah that he had thus once again run into 
<A NAME="101"></A>danger. Yet he told the messengers that he would seek to deliver Kai Kaous, 
<A NAME="102"></A>and that when he had done so he would remember the land of Iran. And forthwith 
<A NAME="103"></A>he sent a secret messenger unto Kai Kaous, a man subtle and wise, and caused 
<A NAME="104"></A>him to say unto the Shah-
<A NAME="105"></A><BR><BR>"An army cometh forth from Iran to redeem thee. Rejoice, therefore, 
<A NAME="106"></A>and cast aside thy fears."
<A NAME="107"></A><BR><BR>And he also sent a writing unto the King of Hamaveran, and the 
<A NAME="108"></A>writing was filled with threats, and spake only of maces and swords and 
<A NAME="109"></A>combat. And Rustem loaded the King with reproaches because of his treachery, 
<A NAME="110"></A>and he bade him prepare to meet Rustem the mighty.
<A NAME="111"></A><BR><BR>When the King of Hamaveran had read this letter his head was troubled, 
<A NAME="112"></A>and he defied Rustem, and threatened him that if he came forth against 
<A NAME="113"></A>him he should meet at his hands the fate of the Shah. But Rustem only smiled 
<A NAME="114"></A>when he heard this answer, and he said-
<A NAME="115"></A><BR><BR>"Surely this man is foolish, or Ahriman hath filled his mind with 
<A NAME="116"></A>smoke."
<A NAME="117"></A><BR><BR>Then he mounted Rakush, and made ready to go into Hamaveran, and 
<A NAME="118"></A>a vast train of warriors went after him. And the King of Hamaveran, when 
<A NAME="119"></A>he saw it sent forth his army against him. But the army were afraid when 
<A NAME="120"></A>they beheld Rustem and his might of mien, his mace, and his strong arms 
<A NAME="121"></A>and lion chest, and their hearts departed from out their bodies, and they 
<A NAME="122"></A>fled from before his sight, and returned them unto the King of 
<A NAME="123"></A>Hamaveran.
<A NAME="124"></A><BR><BR>Now the King was seated in the midst of his counsellors, and when 
<A NAME="125"></A>he saw the army thus scattered before they had struck a blow, his heart 
<A NAME="126"></A>misgave him, and he craved counsel of his chiefs. Then they counselled 
<A NAME="127"></A>him that he should cast about him for allies. So the King of Hamaveran 
<A NAME="128"></A>sent messengers of entreaty unto the Kings of Egypt and Berberistan, and 
<A NAME="129"></A>they listened to his prayers, and sent out a great army unto his aid. And 
<A NAME="130"></A>they drew them up against Rustem, and the armies stretched for two leagues 
<A NAME="131"></A>in length, and you would have said the handful of Rustem could not withstand 
<A NAME="132"></A>their force. Yet Rustem bade his men be not discomfited, and rest their 
<A NAME="133"></A>hopes on God. Then he fell upon the armies of the Kings like to a flame 
<A NAME="134"></A>that darteth forth, and the ground was drenched with gore, and on all sides 
<A NAME="135"></A>rolled heads that were severed from their bodies; and wheresoever Rakush 
<A NAME="136"></A>and Rustem showed themselves, there was great havoc made in the ranks. 
<A NAME="137"></A>And ere the evening was come, the Kings of Egypt and Berberistan were his 
<A NAME="138"></A>captives; and when the sun was set, the King of Hamaveran knew that a day 
<A NAME="139"></A>of ill fortune was ended. So he sent forth to crave mercy at the hands 
<A NAME="140"></A>of the Pehliva. And Rustem listened to his voice, and said that he would 
<A NAME="141"></A>stay his hand if the King would restore unto him Kai Kaous, and the men 
<A NAME="142"></A>and treasures that were his. Then the King of Hamaveran granted the just 
<A NAME="143"></A>requests of Rustem. So Kai Kaous was led forth from his prison, and Sudaveh 
<A NAME="144"></A>came with him. And when they beheld him, the King of Hamaveran and his 
<A NAME="145"></A>allies declared their allegiance unto him, and they marched with him into 
<A NAME="146"></A>Iran to go out against Afrasiyab. And Sudaveh went with the army in a litter 
<A NAME="147"></A>clothed with fair stuffs, and encrusted with wood of aloes. And she was 
<A NAME="148"></A>veiled that none might behold her beauty, and she went with the men like 
<A NAME="149"></A>to the sun when he marcheth behind a cloud.
<A NAME="150"></A><BR><BR>Now when Kai Kaous was come home again unto his land, he sent a 
<A NAME="151"></A>writing unto Afrasiyab. And he said-
<A NAME="152"></A><BR><BR>"Quit, I command thee, the land of Iran, nor seek to enlarge thyself 
<A NAME="153"></A>at my cost. For knowest thou not that Iran is mine, and that the world 
<A NAME="154"></A>pertaineth unto me?"
<A NAME="155"></A><BR><BR>But Afrasiyab answered, "The words which thou dost write are not 
<A NAME="156"></A>becoming unto a man such as thou, who didst covet Mazinderan and the countries 
<A NAME="157"></A>round about. If thou wert satisfied with Iran, wherefore didst thou venture 
<A NAME="158"></A>afield? And I say unto thee, Iran is mine, because of Tur my forefather, 
<A NAME="159"></A>and because I subdued it under my hand."
<A NAME="160"></A><BR><BR>When Kai Kaous had heard these words he knew that Afrasiyab would 
<A NAME="161"></A>not yield save unto force. So he drew up his army into array, and they 
<A NAME="162"></A>marched out to meet the King of Turan. And Afrasiyab met them with a great 
<A NAME="163"></A>host, and the sound of drums and cymbals filled the air. And great was 
<A NAME="164"></A>the strife and bloody, but Rustem broke the force of Turan, and the fortunes 
<A NAME="165"></A>of its army were laid to rest upon the field of battle. And Afrasiyab, 
<A NAME="166"></A>when he beheld it, was discomfited, and his spirit boiled over like to 
<A NAME="167"></A>new wine that fermenteth. And he mourned over his army and the warriors 
<A NAME="168"></A>that he had trained, and he conjured those that remained to make yet another 
<A NAME="169"></A>onslaught, and he spake fair promises unto them if they would deliver unto 
<A NAME="170"></A>his hands Rustem, the Pehliva. And he said-
<A NAME="171"></A><BR><BR>"Whoever shall bring him alive before me, I will give unto him 
<A NAME="172"></A>a kingdom and an umbrella, and the hand of my daughter in 
<A NAME="173"></A>marriage."
<A NAME="174"></A><BR><BR>And the Turks, when they heard these words, girded them yet again 
<A NAME="175"></A>for resistance. But it availed them nought, for the Iranians were mightier 
<A NAME="176"></A>than they, and they watered the earth with their blood until the ground 
<A NAME="177"></A>was like a rose. And the fortunes of the Turks were as a light put out, 
<A NAME="178"></A>and Afrasiyab fled before the face of Rustem, and the remnant of his army 
<A NAME="179"></A>went after him.
<A NAME="180"></A><BR><BR>Then Kai Kaous seated himself once more upon his throne, and men 
<A NAME="181"></A>were glad that there was peace. And the Shah opened the doors of justice 
<A NAME="182"></A>and splendour, and all men did that which was right, and the wolf turned 
<A NAME="183"></A>him away from the lamb, and there was gladness through all the length of 
<A NAME="184"></A>Iran. And the Shah gave thanks unto Rustem that he had aided him yet again, 
<A NAME="185"></A>and he named him Jahani Pehliva, which being interpreted meaneth the champion 
<A NAME="186"></A>of the world, and he called him the source of his happiness. Then he busied 
<A NAME="187"></A>himself with building mighty towers and palaces, and the land of Iran was 
<A NAME="188"></A>made fair at his hands, and all was well once more within its 
<A NAME="189"></A>midst.
<A NAME="190"></A><BR><BR>But Ahriman the wakeful was not pleased thereat, and he pondered 
<A NAME="191"></A>how he could once again arouse the ambition of the Shah. So he held counsel 
<A NAME="192"></A>with his Deevs how they might turn the heart of Kai Kaous from the right 
<A NAME="193"></A>path. And one among them said-
<A NAME="194"></A><BR><BR>"Suffer that I go before the Shah, and I will do thy 
<A NAME="195"></A>behest."
<A NAME="196"></A><BR>And Ahriman suffered it. Then the Deev took upon him the form of a 
<A NAME="197"></A>youth, and in his hand he held a cluster of roses, and he presented them 
<A NAME="198"></A>unto the Shah, and he kissed the ground before his feet. And when Kai Kaous 
<A NAME="199"></A>had given him leave to speak he opened his mouth and 
<A NAME="200"></A>said-
<A NAME="201"></A><BR><BR>"O Shah, live for ever! though such is thy might and majesty that 
<A NAME="202"></A>the vault of heaven alone should be thy throne. All the world is submissive 
<A NAME="203"></A>before thee, and I can bethink me but of one thing that is lacking unto 
<A NAME="204"></A>thy glory."
<A NAME="205"></A><BR><BR>Then Kai Kaous questioned him of this one thing, and the Deev 
<A NAME="206"></A>said-
<A NAME="207"></A><BR><BR>"It is that thou knowest not the nature of the sun and moon, nor 
<A NAME="208"></A>wherefore the planets roll, neither the secret causes that set them in 
<A NAME="209"></A>motion. Thou art master of all the earth, therefore shouldst thou not make 
<A NAME="210"></A>the heavens also obedient to thy will?"
<A NAME="211"></A><BR><BR>When Kai Kaous heard these words of guile his mind was dimmed, 
<A NAME="212"></A>and he forgot that man cannot mount unto the skies, and he pondered without 
<A NAME="213"></A>ceasing how he could fly unto the stars and inquire into their secrets. 
<A NAME="214"></A>And he consulted many wise men in his trouble, but none could aid him. 
<A NAME="215"></A>But at last it came about that a certain man taught him how he could perchance 
<A NAME="216"></A>accomplish his designs. And Kai Kaous did according to his instructions. 
<A NAME="217"></A>He built him a framework of aloe-wood, and at the four corners thereof 
<A NAME="218"></A>he placed javelins upright, and on their points he put the flesh of goats. 
<A NAME="219"></A>Then he chose out four eagles strong of wing, and bound them unto the corners 
<A NAME="220"></A>of this chariot. And when it was done, Kai Kaous seated himself in the 
<A NAME="221"></A>midst thereof with much pomp. And the eagles, when they smelt the flesh, 
<A NAME="222"></A>desired after it, and they flapped their wings and raised themselves, and 
<A NAME="223"></A>raised the framework with them. And they struggled sore, but they could 
<A NAME="224"></A>not attain unto the meat; but ever as they struggled they bore aloft with 
<A NAME="225"></A>them Kai Kaous and the throne whereon he sat. And so long as their hunger 
<A NAME="226"></A>lasted, they strove after the prey. But at length their strength would 
<A NAME="227"></A>hold no longer, and they desisted from the attempt. And behold! as they 
<A NAME="228"></A>desisted the fabric fell back to earth, and the shock thereof was great. 
<A NAME="229"></A>And but for Ormuzd Kai Kaous would have perished in the presumption of 
<A NAME="230"></A>his spirit.
<A NAME="231"></A><BR><BR>Now the eagles had borne the Shah even unto the desert of Cathay, 
<A NAME="232"></A>and there was no man to succour him, and he suffered from the pangs of 
<A NAME="233"></A>hunger, and there was nothing to assuage his longing, neither could his 
<A NAME="234"></A>thirst be stilled. And he was alone, and sorrowful and shamed in his soul 
<A NAME="235"></A>that he had yet again brought derision upon Iran. And he prayed to God 
<A NAME="236"></A>in his trouble, and entreated pardon for his sins.
<A NAME="237"></A><BR><BR>While Kai Kaous thus strove with repentance, Rustem learned tidings 
<A NAME="238"></A>of him, and he set out with an army to seek him. And when he had found 
<A NAME="239"></A>him he gave rein unto his anger, and he rebuked him for his follies, and 
<A NAME="240"></A>he said-
<A NAME="241"></A><BR><BR>"Hath the world seen the like of this man? Hath a more foolish 
<A NAME="242"></A>head sat upon the throne of Iran? Ye would say there were no brains within 
<A NAME="243"></A>this skull, or that not one of its thoughts was good. Kai Kaous is like 
<A NAME="244"></A>a thing that is possessed, and every wind beareth him away. Thrice hast 
<A NAME="245"></A>thou now fallen into mishap, and who can tell whether thy spirit hath yet 
<A NAME="246"></A>learned wisdom? And it will be a reproach unto Iran all her days that a 
<A NAME="247"></A>king puffed up with idle pride was seated upon her throne, a man who deemed 
<A NAME="248"></A>in his folly that he could mount unto the skies, and visit the sun and 
<A NAME="249"></A>moon, and count the stars one by one. I entreat of thee to bethink thee 
<A NAME="250"></A>of thy forefathers, and follow in their steps, and rule the land in equity, 
<A NAME="251"></A>neither rush after these mad adventures."
<A NAME="252"></A><BR><BR>When Kai Kaous had listened to the bitter words spoken by Rustem, 
<A NAME="253"></A>he was bowed down in his spirit and ashamed before him in his soul. And 
<A NAME="254"></A>when at last he opened his mouth it was to utter words of humility. And 
<A NAME="255"></A>he said unto Rustem-
<A NAME="256"></A><BR><BR>"Surely that which thou speakest, it is true."
<A NAME="257"></A><BR>Then he suffered himself to be led back unto his palace, and many days 
<A NAME="258"></A>and nights did he lie in the dust before God, and it was long before he 
<A NAME="259"></A>held him worthy to mount again upon his throne. But when he deemed that 
<A NAME="260"></A>God had forgiven him, he seated him upon it once again. In humility did 
<A NAME="261"></A>he mount it, and he filled it in wisdom. And henceforth he ruled the land 
<A NAME="262"></A>with justice, and he did that which was right in the sight of God, and 
<A NAME="263"></A>bathed his face with the waters of sincerity. And kings and rulers did 
<A NAME="264"></A>homage before him, and forgot the follies that he had done, and Kai Kaous 
<A NAME="265"></A>grew worthy of the throne of light. And Iran was exalted at his hands, 
<A NAME="266"></A>and power and prosperity increased within its borders.
