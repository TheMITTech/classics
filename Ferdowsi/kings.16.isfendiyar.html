<A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A>Lohurasp reigned in wisdom upon the crystal throne, and Iran was as wax 
<A NAME="11"></A>under his hands. And men were content under his sway, save only Gushtasp, 
<A NAME="12"></A>his son, who was rebellious of spirit. And Gushtasp was angered because 
<A NAME="13"></A>his father would not abandon unto him the sovereignty. Wherefore, when 
<A NAME="14"></A>he beheld that his pleading was vain, he stole away from Iran and sought 
<A NAME="15"></A>out the land of Roum, and the city that Silim his forefather had builded. 
<A NAME="16"></A>And he did great deeds of prowess in the land, so that the King gave unto 
<A NAME="17"></A>him his daughter to wife.
<A NAME="18"></A><BR><BR>Now Lohurasp, when he learned of the mighty deeds done of his son, 
<A NAME="19"></A>strove to win him back unto himself. So he sent forth messengers bearing 
<A NAME="20"></A>words of greeting and entreated of Gushtasp that he would return unto the 
<A NAME="21"></A>courts of his father. And he sware unto him that if he would listen unto 
<A NAME="22"></A>his voice, he would abandon unto him the throne. So Gushtasp listened to 
<A NAME="23"></A>the voice of his father, and he returned him unto Iran. And Lohurasp stepped 
<A NAME="24"></A>down from off the throne of the Kaianides and gave place unto Gushtasp, 
<A NAME="25"></A>his son. And one hundred and twenty years had he reigned in equity, and 
<A NAME="26"></A>now that it was done he hid himself within the temples of Balkh, that he 
<A NAME="27"></A>might live in the sight of God, and make him ready to meet his end. And 
<A NAME="28"></A>Gushtasp, his son, ruled the land worthily, and he administered justice 
<A NAME="29"></A>in such wise that sheep could drink at the same brook as the 
<A NAME="30"></A>wolves.
<A NAME="31"></A><BR><BR>Now when he had sat some while upon the throne, there appeared 
<A NAME="32"></A>in the land Zerdusht, the prophet of the Most High. And he came before 
<A NAME="33"></A>the Shah and taught him, and he went out in all the land and gave unto 
<A NAME="34"></A>the people a new faith. And he purged Iran of the might of Ahriman. He 
<A NAME="35"></A>reared throughout the realm a tree of goodly foliage, and men rested beneath 
<A NAME="36"></A>its branches. And whosoever ate of the leaves thereof was learned in all 
<A NAME="37"></A>that regardeth the life to come, but whosoever ate of the branches was 
<A NAME="38"></A>perfect in wisdom and faith. And Zerdusht gave unto men the Zendavesta, 
<A NAME="39"></A>and he bade them obey its precepts if they would attain everlasting 
<A NAME="40"></A>life.
<A NAME="41"></A><BR><BR>But tidings concerning Zerdusht were come even unto Arjasp, who 
<A NAME="42"></A>sat upon the throne of Afrasiyab, and he said within himself, "This thing 
<A NAME="43"></A>is vile." So he refused ear unto the faith, and he sent a writing unto 
<A NAME="44"></A>Gushtasp, wherein he bade him return unto the creed of his fathers. And 
<A NAME="45"></A>he said-
<A NAME="46"></A><BR><BR>"If thou turn thee not, make thee ready for combat; for verily 
<A NAME="47"></A>I say unto thee, that unless thou cast out Zerdusht, this man of guile, 
<A NAME="48"></A>I will overthrow thy kingdom and seat me upon thy throne."
<A NAME="49"></A><BR><BR>When Gushtasp heard the haughty words that Arjasp had spoken, he 
<A NAME="50"></A>marvelled within himself. Then he called before him a scribe, and sent 
<A NAME="51"></A>back answer unto Arjasp. And he said that he would deliver up unto the 
<A NAME="52"></A>sword whosoever swerved from the paths of Zerdusht, and whosoever would 
<A NAME="53"></A>not choose them, him also would he destroy. And he bade him, therefore, 
<A NAME="54"></A>get ready to meet Iran in battle. Then when he had sent this writing, Gushtasp 
<A NAME="55"></A>got together his hosts and mustered them, and he beheld that they outnumbered 
<A NAME="56"></A>the grass upon the fields. And the dust that uprose from their feet darkened 
<A NAME="57"></A>the sky, and the neighing of their horses and the clashing of their armour 
<A NAME="58"></A>were heard above the music of the cymbals. And the banners pierced the 
<A NAME="59"></A>clouds like to trees that grow upon a mountain. And Gushtasp gave the command 
<A NAME="60"></A>of this host unto Isfendiyar, his son. And Isfendiyar was a hero of renown, 
<A NAME="61"></A>and his tongue was a bright sword, and his heart was bounteous as the ocean, 
<A NAME="62"></A>and his hands were like the clouds when rain falls to gladden the earth. 
<A NAME="63"></A>And he took the lead of the army, and he led it forth into 
<A NAME="64"></A>Turan.
<A NAME="65"></A><BR><BR>Now when the men of Turan and of Iran met in conflict, a great 
<A NAME="66"></A>battle was waged between them, and for the space of twice seven days they 
<A NAME="67"></A>did not cease from combat, neither did any of the heroes close their eyes 
<A NAME="68"></A>in slumber. And their rage was hot one against another, but in the end 
<A NAME="69"></A>the might of Iran overcame, and Arjasp fled before the face of 
<A NAME="70"></A>Isfendiyar.
<A NAME="71"></A><BR><BR>Then Isfendiyar returned him unto Iran, and presented himself before 
<A NAME="72"></A>his father, and demanded a blessing at his hands. But Gushtasp 
<A NAME="73"></A>said-
<A NAME="74"></A><BR><BR>"The time is not yet come when thou shouldest mount the 
<A NAME="75"></A>throne."
<A NAME="76"></A><BR>So he sent him forth yet again that he might turn all the lands unto 
<A NAME="77"></A>the faith of Zerdusht. And Isfendiyar did as Gushtasp 
<A NAME="78"></A>commanded.
<A NAME="79"></A><BR><BR>Now while he was gone forth there came before the Shah one Gurjam, 
<A NAME="80"></A>who was of evil mind and foe unto Isfendiyar. And he spake ill of Isfendiyar 
<A NAME="81"></A>unto his father, and he said unto Gushtasp that his son strove to wrest 
<A NAME="82"></A>from him the sovereignty. And Gushtasp, when he learned it, was wroth, 
<A NAME="83"></A>and he sent forth messengers that they should search out Isfendiyar, and 
<A NAME="84"></A>bring him before the Shah in the assembly of the nobles. And when Isfendiyar 
<A NAME="85"></A>was come, Gushtasp spake not unto him in greeting, but he turned him to 
<A NAME="86"></A>his nobles, and he recounted unto them a parable. Then he told unto them 
<A NAME="87"></A>of a son who sought to put to death his father, and he asked of them what 
<A NAME="88"></A>punishment this father should mete out unto his child. And the nobles cried 
<A NAME="89"></A>with one accord-
<A NAME="90"></A><BR><BR>"This thing which thou relatest unto us, it is not right, and if 
<A NAME="91"></A>there be a son so evil, let him be put into chains and cast in 
<A NAME="92"></A>bondage."
<A NAME="93"></A><BR><BR>Then Gushtasp said, "Let Isfendiyar be put into 
<A NAME="94"></A>chains."
<A NAME="95"></A><BR>And Isfendiyar opened his mouth in vain before his father, for Gushtasp 
<A NAME="96"></A>would not listen unto his voice. So they cast him out into a dungeon, and 
<A NAME="97"></A>chains of weight were hung upon him, and the daylight came not nigh unto 
<A NAME="98"></A>him, neither did joy enter into his heart. And he languished many years, 
<A NAME="99"></A>and the heart of the Shah was not softened towards him.
<A NAME="100"></A><BR><BR>Now when Arjasp learned that the might of Isfendiyar was fettered, 
<A NAME="101"></A>and that Gushtasp was given over to pleasures, he gathered together an 
<A NAME="102"></A>army to fall into Iran and avenge the defeat that was come upon his hosts. 
<A NAME="103"></A>So he fell upon Balkh before any were aware of it and he put to death Lohurasp 
<A NAME="104"></A>the Shah and he made captive the daughters of Gushtasp. And Arjasp threw 
<A NAME="105"></A>fire into the temples of Zerdusht and did much destruction unto the city 
<A NAME="106"></A>and it was some while ere Gushtasp learned that which he had done. But 
<A NAME="107"></A>when he had news thereof he was dismayed, and he called together his army 
<A NAME="108"></A>and put himself at their head. But the Turanians were mightier than he, 
<A NAME="109"></A>and they routed him utterly, and Gushtasp fled before their face. Then 
<A NAME="110"></A>the Shah called together his nobles, and consulted with them how he should 
<A NAME="111"></A>act in these sore straits. And one among them who was wise above the rest 
<A NAME="112"></A>said-
<A NAME="113"></A><BR><BR>"I counsel thee that thou release Isfendiyar, thy son, and that 
<A NAME="114"></A>thou give to him the command, for he alone can deliver the 
<A NAME="115"></A>land."
<A NAME="116"></A><BR><BR>And Gushtasp said, "I will do as thou sayest, and if Isfendiyar 
<A NAME="117"></A>shall deliver us from this foe, I will abandon unto him the throne and 
<A NAME="118"></A>the crown."
<A NAME="119"></A><BR><BR>Then he sent messengers unto Isfendiyar that they should unbind 
<A NAME="120"></A>his chains. But Isfendiyar, when they came before him, closed ear unto 
<A NAME="121"></A>their voice. And he said-
<A NAME="122"></A><BR><BR>"My father hath kept me in bondage until he hath need of me. Why 
<A NAME="123"></A>therefore should I weary me in his cause? I will not go unto his 
<A NAME="124"></A>aid."
<A NAME="125"></A><BR><BR>Then the men reasoned with him, and they told unto him how it had 
<A NAME="126"></A>been revealed unto Gushtasp that the words spoken of Gurjam were false, 
<A NAME="127"></A>and that he had sworn that he would deliver this man of false words unto 
<A NAME="128"></A>the vengeance of his son. But Isfendiyar was deaf yet again to their voice. 
<A NAME="129"></A>Then one spake and said-
<A NAME="130"></A><BR><BR>"Thou knowest not that thy brother is in bondage unto Arjasp. Surely 
<A NAME="131"></A>it behoveth thee to deliver him."
<A NAME="132"></A><BR><BR>When Isfendiyar heard these words he sprang unto his feet, and 
<A NAME="133"></A>he commanded that the chains be struck from off his limbs. And because 
<A NAME="134"></A>the men were slow, he was angered, and shook himself mightily, so that 
<A NAME="135"></A>the fetters fell down at his feet. Then he made haste to go before his 
<A NAME="136"></A>father. And peace was made between them on that day, and Gushtasp sware 
<A NAME="137"></A>a great oath that he would give the throne unto Isfendiyar when he should 
<A NAME="138"></A>return unto him victorious.
<A NAME="139"></A><BR><BR>So Isfendiyar went out against the foes of Iran, and he mowed them 
<A NAME="140"></A>down with the sword and he caused arrows to rain upon them like hail in 
<A NAME="141"></A>spring, and the sun was darkened by the flight of the weapons. And he brake 
<A NAME="142"></A>the power of Arjasp, King of Turan, and he drove him out from the borders 
<A NAME="143"></A>of the realm. And when it was done, and the men of Iran had prevailed over 
<A NAME="144"></A>the men of Turan, Isfendiyar presented himself before his father and craved 
<A NAME="145"></A>of him the fulfilment of his promises. But Gushtasp, when he beheld that 
<A NAME="146"></A>all was well once more, repented him of his resolve, for he desired not 
<A NAME="147"></A>to give the throne unto his son. So he pondered in his spirit what he should 
<A NAME="148"></A>say in his excuse, and he was ashamed in his soul. But his mouth revealed 
<A NAME="149"></A>not the thoughts of his heart, and he spake angrily unto his son, and he 
<A NAME="150"></A>said-
<A NAME="151"></A><BR><BR>"I marvel that thou comest before me with this demand; for while 
<A NAME="152"></A>thy sisters languish in the bondage of Arjasp, it beseemeth us not to hold 
<A NAME="153"></A>this war as ended, lest men mock us with their tongues. And it hath been 
<A NAME="154"></A>told unto me that they are hidden in the brazen fortress, and that Arjasp 
<A NAME="155"></A>and all his men are gone in behind its walls. I charge thee, therefore, 
<A NAME="156"></A>overthrow the castle and deliver thy sisters who pine. And I swear unto 
<A NAME="157"></A>thee, when thou hast done it, I will abandon unto thee the throne, and 
<A NAME="158"></A>thy name shall be exalted in the land."
<A NAME="159"></A><BR><BR>Then Isfendiyar said, "I am the servant of the Shah, let him command 
<A NAME="160"></A>his slave what he shall do."
<A NAME="161"></A><BR><BR>And Gushtasp said, "Go forth."
<A NAME="162"></A><BR>Then Isfendiyar answered, "I go, but the road is not known unto 
<A NAME="163"></A>me."
<A NAME="164"></A><BR><BR>And Gushtasp said, "A Mubid hath revealed it unto me. Three roads 
<A NAME="165"></A>lead unto the fortress of brass, and the one requireth three months to 
<A NAME="166"></A>traverse, but it is safe, and much pasture is found on its path. And the 
<A NAME="167"></A>second demandeth but two moons, yet it is a desert void of herbs. And the 
<A NAME="168"></A>third asketh but seven days, but it is fraught with 
<A NAME="169"></A>danger."
<A NAME="170"></A><BR><BR>Then Isfendiyar said, "No man can die before his time is come. 
<A NAME="171"></A>It behoveth a man of valour to choose ever the shortest 
<A NAME="172"></A>path."
<A NAME="173"></A><BR><BR>Now the Mubids and the nobles who knew the dangers that were hidden 
<A NAME="174"></A>in this path sought to deter him, but Isfendiyar would not listen to their 
<A NAME="175"></A>voice. So he set forth with his army, and they marched until they came 
<A NAME="176"></A>to the spot where the roads divided. Now it needed seven stages to reach 
<A NAME="177"></A>the fortress of Arjasp, and at each stage there lurked a danger, and never 
<A NAME="178"></A>yet had any man overcome them or passed beneath its walls. But Isfendiyar 
<A NAME="179"></A>would not give ear to fear, and he set forth upon the road, and each day 
<A NAME="180"></A>he overcame a danger, and each danger was greater than the last. And on 
<A NAME="181"></A>the first day he slew two raging wolves, and on the second he laid low 
<A NAME="182"></A>two evil Deevs that were clothed as lions, and on the third he overcame 
<A NAME="183"></A>a dragon whose breath was poison. And on the fourth day Isfendiyar slew 
<A NAME="184"></A>a great magician who would have lured him into the paths of evil, and on 
<A NAME="185"></A>the fifth he slew a mighty bird whom no man had ever struck down. And weariness 
<A NAME="186"></A>was not known of Isfendiyar, neither could he rest from his labours, for 
<A NAME="187"></A>there was no camping-place in his road of danger. And on the sixth day 
<A NAME="188"></A>he was nigh to have perished with his army in a deep snow that fell upon 
<A NAME="189"></A>him through the might of the Deevs. But he prayed unto God in his distress, 
<A NAME="190"></A>and by the favour of Heaven the snow vanished from under his feet. Then 
<A NAME="191"></A>on the seventh day he came nigh to perish in a flood of waters but Isfendiyar 
<A NAME="192"></A>overcame them also, and stood before the castle of Arjasp. Now when he 
<A NAME="193"></A>beheld it, his heart failed within him, for he saw that it was compassed 
<A NAME="194"></A>by a wall of brass, and the thickness thereof was such that four horsemen 
<A NAME="195"></A>could ride thereon abreast. So he sighed and said-
<A NAME="196"></A><BR><BR>"This place cannot be taken, my pains have been in 
<A NAME="197"></A>vain."
<A NAME="198"></A><BR>Yet he pondered in his spirit how it might be done, and he knew that 
<A NAME="199"></A>only wile could avail. Wherefore he disguised himself in the garb of a 
<A NAME="200"></A>merchant, and chose forth from his army a hundred camels, and he loaded 
<A NAME="201"></A>them with brocades of Roum and much treasure. A hundred and sixty stalwart 
<A NAME="202"></A>warriors too did he choose forth, and he seated them in chests, and the 
<A NAME="203"></A>chests he bound upon the backs of the camels. And when the caravan was 
<A NAME="204"></A>ready he marched at its head unto the doors of the fortress.
<A NAME="205"></A><BR><BR>Now when he was come thither, he craved permission of Arjasp that 
<A NAME="206"></A>he might enter and sell unto them that dwelt therein. And Arjasp granted 
<A NAME="207"></A>his request, and gave unto him houseroom, and bade him barter his wares 
<A NAME="208"></A>in safety. Then Isfendiyar spread forth his goods and unloaded the treasures 
<A NAME="209"></A>of the camels, but the chests wherein were hidden the warriors did he keep 
<A NAME="210"></A>from the eyes of men. And after he had sojourned a while in the castle 
<A NAME="211"></A>he beheld his sisters, and he saw that they were held as slaves, and his 
<A NAME="212"></A>heart went out towards them. So he spake to them tenderly, and they knew 
<A NAME="213"></A>his voice, and that help was come out to them, but they held their peace 
<A NAME="214"></A>and made no sign. And Isfendiyar, when he saw that he was trusted of Arjasp, 
<A NAME="215"></A>came before him and asked of him a boon. And Arjasp said that he would 
<A NAME="216"></A>grant it. Then Isfendiyar said-
<A NAME="217"></A><BR><BR>"Suffer that ere I go hence I may feast thee and thy nobles, that 
<A NAME="218"></A>I may show my gratitude."
<A NAME="219"></A><BR><BR>And it was done as Isfendiyar desired, and he made a great feast 
<A NAME="220"></A>and troubled the heads of the nobles with wine. And when their heads were 
<A NAME="221"></A>heavy and the moon was seated upon her silver throne, Isfendiyar arose 
<A NAME="222"></A>and let forth his warriors from the chests. Then he fell upon the nobles 
<A NAME="223"></A>and slew them, and they weltered in their blood. And with his own hand 
<A NAME="224"></A>Isfendiyar struck down Arjasp, and he hung up his sons upon high gallows. 
<A NAME="225"></A>Then he made signals unto his army that they should come forth to aid him, 
<A NAME="226"></A>for there were yet many men hidden in the fort, and Isfendiyar had but 
<A NAME="227"></A>a handful wherewith to withstand them. And they did as he desired, and 
<A NAME="228"></A>there was a great slaughter within the brazen fort, but Isfendiyar bare 
<A NAME="229"></A>off the victory. Then he took with him his sisters and much booty, and 
<A NAME="230"></A>made haste to return unto Iran, and come into the presence of Gushtasp, 
<A NAME="231"></A>his father. And the Shah rejoiced in his sight, and he made a great feast, 
<A NAME="232"></A>and gave gifts richly unto all his servants. And the mouths of men overflowed 
<A NAME="233"></A>with the doughty deeds done of Isfendiyar, and there was gladness throughout 
<A NAME="234"></A>the land.
