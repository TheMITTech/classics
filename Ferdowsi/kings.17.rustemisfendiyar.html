<A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A>When a little while had been passed in feasting, Isfendiyar came before 
<A NAME="11"></A>Gushtasp, his father, and demanded the fulfilment of the promises that 
<A NAME="12"></A>he had made unto him. And he recalled unto Gushtasp how he had mistrusted 
<A NAME="13"></A>him and thrown him into chains. And he spake of the doughty deeds that 
<A NAME="14"></A>he had done at his behest, and he craved him to remember that Isfendiyar 
<A NAME="15"></A>was his son. And Gushtasp knew that that which was spoken was right, but 
<A NAME="16"></A>he desired not to abandon the throne. Wherefore he communed within him 
<A NAME="17"></A>what he should do. Then he opened his mouth and spake, 
<A NAME="18"></A>saying-
<A NAME="19"></A><BR><BR>"Verily thou hast done that which thou sayest, and there is none 
<A NAME="20"></A>who is thine equal in this world, save only Rustem, the son of Zal. And 
<A NAME="21"></A>he acknowledgeth none his like. Now because he is grown proud in his spirit, 
<A NAME="22"></A>and hath rendered no homage unto me, neither is come forth to aid me against 
<A NAME="23"></A>Arjasp, I desire that thou go forth unto Zaboulistan, and that thou lead 
<A NAME="24"></A>out the Pehliva, and bring him bound before me, that he may know that I 
<A NAME="25"></A>am the Shah, and that he must do my behests. And when thou shalt have done 
<A NAME="26"></A>it, I swear unto thee by Him from whom cometh all strength, and who hath 
<A NAME="27"></A>kindled the sun and the stars unto light, that I will step down from the 
<A NAME="28"></A>throne, neither withhold it from thee any longer."
<A NAME="29"></A><BR><BR>Then Isfendiyar said, "O King, I would entreat of thee that thou 
<A NAME="30"></A>ponder the words that thou hast spoken. For thine ancestors held this old 
<A NAME="31"></A>man, ripe in wisdom, in much honour, and he was a staff unto their throne. 
<A NAME="32"></A>Now since thou calledst him not forth, it was not fitting he should aid 
<A NAME="33"></A>thee against Turan."
<A NAME="34"></A><BR><BR>But Gushtasp would not listen unto the words of Isfendiyar, and 
<A NAME="35"></A>he said-
<A NAME="36"></A><BR><BR>"If thou lead not Rustem bound before me, I will not grant unto 
<A NAME="37"></A>thee the throne."
<A NAME="38"></A><BR><BR>Then Isfendiyar said, "Thou sendest me forth in guile on this emprise, 
<A NAME="39"></A>for verily no man hath stood against the might of Rustem, wherefore I perceive 
<A NAME="40"></A>that thou desirest not to abandon unto me the throne. I say unto thee, 
<A NAME="41"></A>therefore, that I desire it no longer; but since I am thy slave, it beseemeth 
<A NAME="42"></A>me to obey thy behests. I go forth therefore, and if peradventure I fall 
<A NAME="43"></A>before Rustem, thou wilt answer unto God for my blood."
<A NAME="44"></A><BR><BR>And when he had so spoken, Isfendiyar went out of the presence 
<A NAME="45"></A>of the Shah, and he was exceeding sorrowful. Then he gathered together 
<A NAME="46"></A>an army, and he set forth upon the road that leadeth to 
<A NAME="47"></A>Seistan.
<A NAME="48"></A><BR><BR>Now when they were gone but a little way, the camel that walked 
<A NAME="49"></A>at their head laid him down in the dust. And the drivers struck him, but 
<A NAME="50"></A>he would not rise from the earth. Then Isfendiyar said, "The omen is evil." 
<A NAME="51"></A>But he commanded the driver that he cut off the head, that the evil might 
<A NAME="52"></A>fall upon the beast and tarnish not the glory of the Shah. And it was done 
<A NAME="53"></A>as Isfendiyar desired, but he could not rid him of his sadness, and he 
<A NAME="54"></A>pondered in his spirit this sign.
<A NAME="55"></A><BR><BR>Now when they were come unto the land of Zaboulistan, Isfendiyar 
<A NAME="56"></A>spake, saying-
<A NAME="57"></A><BR><BR>"I will send an envoy unto Rustem, a man prudent and wise. And 
<A NAME="58"></A>I will entreat of the Pehliva that he come before me with gladness, for 
<A NAME="59"></A>I desire no evil unto him, and I come forth only at the behest of the 
<A NAME="60"></A>Shah."
<A NAME="61"></A><BR><BR>Then he called before him Bahman, his son, and he spake long unto 
<A NAME="62"></A>him, and he charged him with a message unto Rustem. And he bade him speak 
<A NAME="63"></A>unto the son of Zal how Gushtasp was angered because he sought not his 
<A NAME="64"></A>courts, wherefore he deemed that Rustem was grown proud in his spirit, 
<A NAME="65"></A>and would uplift himself above his Shah. And he said-
<A NAME="66"></A><BR><BR>"The King hath sent me out that I lead thee before him. I pray 
<A NAME="67"></A>thee, therefore, come unto me, and I swear unto thee that no harm shall 
<A NAME="68"></A>befall thee at his hands. For when I shall have led thee before him, I 
<A NAME="69"></A>will demand as my guerdon that he suffer thee to go 
<A NAME="70"></A>unharmed."
<A NAME="71"></A><BR><BR>So Bahman laid up these words in his spirit, and he went with all 
<A NAME="72"></A>speed unto the courts of Rustem. Now, he found therein none but Zal, for 
<A NAME="73"></A>Rustem was gone forth with his warriors to chase the wild ass. And Zal 
<A NAME="74"></A>came forth with courtesy to greet Bahman, and he asked of him his desires, 
<A NAME="75"></A>and he invited him unto a feast. But Bahman said-
<A NAME="76"></A><BR><BR>"My mission doth admit of no delay. Isfendiyar hath bidden me not 
<A NAME="77"></A>tarry by the road. Tell me, therefore, where I may find thy 
<A NAME="78"></A>son."
<A NAME="79"></A><BR><BR>Then Zal showed unto him the way.
<A NAME="80"></A><BR>Now when Bahman was come unto the spot, he beheld a man like unto a 
<A NAME="81"></A>mountain, who was roasting a wild ass for his supper. And in his hand was 
<A NAME="82"></A>a wine-cup, and about him stood brave knights. Then Bahman said within 
<A NAME="83"></A>himself, "Surely this is Rustem," and he watched him from where he was 
<A NAME="84"></A>hid, and he beheld that Rustem devoured the whole of a wild ass for his 
<A NAME="85"></A>meal, and he was amazed at the might and majesty of this man. Then he thought 
<A NAME="86"></A>within him, "Peradventure if I cast down a rock upon him, I may slay him, 
<A NAME="87"></A>for surely even Isfendiyar, my father, shall not withstand his strength." 
<A NAME="88"></A>So he loosened a rock from the mountain-side, and set it rolling unto the 
<A NAME="89"></A>spot where Rustem was encamped. Now Zevarah heard the sound thereof, and 
<A NAME="90"></A>beheld the rock, and he said unto Rustem-
<A NAME="91"></A><BR><BR>"Behold a rock that springeth forth from the 
<A NAME="92"></A>mountain-side."
<A NAME="93"></A><BR>But Rustem smiled, and arose not from his seat; and when the rock was 
<A NAME="94"></A>upon him, he lifted up his foot and threw it far unto the other side. Then 
<A NAME="95"></A>Bahman was amazed, but he was affrighted also, and he dared not come forth 
<A NAME="96"></A>at once. Yet when he was come before the Pehliva, Rustem greeted him kindly, 
<A NAME="97"></A>and would have entertained him. And Bahman suffered it, and he marvelled 
<A NAME="98"></A>yet again when he beheld that which was eaten of Rustem, and he was afraid. 
<A NAME="99"></A>Then he delivered unto him the message of Isfendiyar, his father. And Rustem 
<A NAME="100"></A>listened unto it, and when it was ended he spake, saying-
<A NAME="101"></A><BR><BR>"Bear greeting unto the hero of renown, and say unto him that I 
<A NAME="102"></A>have longed to look upon his face, and that I rejoice that he is come forth 
<A NAME="103"></A>unto Zaboulistan. But his demand is the device of Deevs, and I would counsel 
<A NAME="104"></A>him that he depart not from the paths of wisdom. And I say unto him, Count 
<A NAME="105"></A>not upon thy strength, for it is given to no man to shut up the winds within 
<A NAME="106"></A>a cage, neither can any man stand against my might. And I have ever done 
<A NAME="107"></A>that which was right before the Shahs, thy fathers, and no man hath beheld 
<A NAME="108"></A>Rustem in chains. Therefore thy demand is foolish, and I bid thee abandon 
<A NAME="109"></A>it, and honour my house with thy presence. And when we shall have feasted, 
<A NAME="110"></A>I will go forth with thee before Gushtasp, thy father, and the reins of 
<A NAME="111"></A>my horse shall be tied unto thine throughout the journey. And when I shall 
<A NAME="112"></A>be come before the Shah, and shall have taken counsel with him, I know 
<A NAME="113"></A>that his anger against me, which is unjust, will vanish like unto 
<A NAME="114"></A>smoke."
<A NAME="115"></A><BR><BR>Then Rustem sent a messenger unto Rudabeh, his mother, to make 
<A NAME="116"></A>ready a great feast in his courts. And Bahman sped back unto his 
<A NAME="117"></A>father.
<A NAME="118"></A><BR><BR>Now Isfendiyar, when he had listened unto the words sent by Rustem, 
<A NAME="119"></A>mounted his steed, and rode forth to meet him. And Rustem was come forth 
<A NAME="120"></A>also, and they met beside the stream. Then Rakush swam across its breadth, 
<A NAME="121"></A>and the hero of the world stood before Isfendiyar, and he greeted him, 
<A NAME="122"></A>and did homage unto the son of his Shah. And Rustem rejoiced in the sight 
<A NAME="123"></A>of Isfendiyar, and he deemed that he beheld in him the face of Saiawush. 
<A NAME="124"></A>And he said unto him-
<A NAME="125"></A><BR><BR>"O young man, let us commune together concerning the things that 
<A NAME="126"></A>divide us."
<A NAME="127"></A><BR><BR>And Isfendiyar assented unto the desires of Rustem, and he pressed 
<A NAME="128"></A>him unto his bosom, and his eyes could not cease from gazing upon his strength. 
<A NAME="129"></A>Then Rustem said-
<A NAME="130"></A><BR><BR>"O hero, I have a prayer to make before thee; I crave that thou 
<A NAME="131"></A>enter into my house as my guest."
<A NAME="132"></A><BR><BR>And Isfendiyar said, "I cannot listen unto thy demand, for the 
<A NAME="133"></A>Shah commanded me neither to rest nor tarry until I should have brought 
<A NAME="134"></A>thee unto him in chains. But I entreat of thee that thou consider that 
<A NAME="135"></A>the chains of the King of kings do not dishonour, and that thou listen 
<A NAME="136"></A>willingly unto the desires of the Shah, for I would not lift my hand in 
<A NAME="137"></A>anger against thee, and I am grieved that it hath been given unto me to 
<A NAME="138"></A>do this thing. But it behoveth me to fulfil the commandments of my 
<A NAME="139"></A>father."
<A NAME="140"></A><BR><BR>Thus spake Isfendiyar in the unquietude of his spirit, for he knew 
<A NAME="141"></A>that what was demanded of Rustem was not fitting or right. And Rustem replied, 
<A NAME="142"></A>saying-
<A NAME="143"></A><BR><BR>"It would be counted shame unto me if thou shouldst refuse to enter 
<A NAME="144"></A>into my house. I pray thee, therefore, yet again that thou accede to my 
<A NAME="145"></A>desires, and when it shall be done I will do that which thou desirest, 
<A NAME="146"></A>save only that I cannot submit unto the chains. For no man hath beheld 
<A NAME="147"></A>me fettered, neither shall any do so while I draw my breath. I have spoken, 
<A NAME="148"></A>and that which I have said, it is true."
<A NAME="149"></A><BR><BR>And Isfendiyar said, "I may not feast with thee, and if thou listen 
<A NAME="150"></A>not to my voice, I must fall upon thee in enmity. But to-day let there 
<A NAME="151"></A>be a truce between us, and drink thou with me in my 
<A NAME="152"></A>tents."
<A NAME="153"></A><BR><BR>And Rustem said, "I will do so gladly, suffer only that I go forth 
<A NAME="154"></A>and change my robes, for I am clad for the chase. And when thy meal shall 
<A NAME="155"></A>be ready, send forth a messenger that he may lead me 
<A NAME="156"></A>thither."
<A NAME="157"></A><BR><BR>And when he had so spoken, Rustem leaped upon Rakush and returned 
<A NAME="158"></A>unto his courts. Now when he had arrayed himself for the banquet, he awaited 
<A NAME="159"></A>the envoy that Isfendiyar should send. But Isfendiyar was full of cares, 
<A NAME="160"></A>and he said unto Bashuntan, his brother-
<A NAME="161"></A><BR><BR>"We have regarded this affair too lightly, for it is full of danger. 
<A NAME="162"></A>Wherefore I have no place in the house of Rustem, neither should he enter 
<A NAME="163"></A>into mine, for the sword must decide our strife. For which cause I shall 
<A NAME="164"></A>not bid him unto my feast."
<A NAME="165"></A><BR><BR>Then Bashuntan answered and said, "A Deev hath led thee astray, 
<A NAME="166"></A>O my brother, for it is not fitting that men like unto Rustem and Isfendiyar 
<A NAME="167"></A>should meet in enmity. Wherefore I counsel thee that thou listen not unto 
<A NAME="168"></A>our father, for his desires are evil, and he seeketh but to ensnare thee. 
<A NAME="169"></A>Yet thou art wiser than he; abandon, therefore, this device of 
<A NAME="170"></A>evil."
<A NAME="171"></A><BR><BR>But Isfendiyar answered and said, "If I obey not the words of the 
<A NAME="172"></A>King, my father, it will be a reproach unto me in this world, and I shall 
<A NAME="173"></A>have to render account for it in the next before God, my Maker. And I would 
<A NAME="174"></A>not lose both worlds because of Rustem."
<A NAME="175"></A><BR><BR>Then Bashuntan said, "I have given unto thee counsel according 
<A NAME="176"></A>to my wisdom, it resteth with thee to do as thou desirest."
<A NAME="177"></A><BR><BR>Then Isfendiyar bade the cooks serve before him the banquet, but 
<A NAME="178"></A>he sent not forth to call Rustem unto the feast.
<A NAME="179"></A><BR><BR>Now Rustem, when he had waited a long while and beheld that Isfendiyar 
<A NAME="180"></A>sent not to call him forth, was angered, and he said-
<A NAME="181"></A><BR><BR>"Is this the courtesy of a King?"
<A NAME="182"></A><BR>And he sprang upon Rakush and rode unto the tents of the prince that 
<A NAME="183"></A>he might question him wherefore he regarded Rustem thus lightly. Now the 
<A NAME="184"></A>warriors of Iran, when they beheld the Pehliva, murmured among themselves 
<A NAME="185"></A>against Gushtasp, and they spake as with the voice of one man, that surely 
<A NAME="186"></A>the Shah was bereft of reason or he would not thus send Isfendiyar unto 
<A NAME="187"></A>death. And they said-
<A NAME="188"></A><BR><BR>"Gushtasp loveth yet more his treasures and his throne as age creepeth 
<A NAME="189"></A>upon him, and this is but a device to preserve them unto 
<A NAME="190"></A>himself."
<A NAME="191"></A><BR><BR>Now Rustem, when he had presented himself before Isfendiyar, spake 
<A NAME="192"></A>and said-
<A NAME="193"></A><BR><BR>"O young man, it would seem unto me that thou didst not deem thy 
<A NAME="194"></A>guest worthy a messenger. Yet I say unto thee that it is I who have made 
<A NAME="195"></A>the throne of Iran to shine out unto all the world, and I have ever been 
<A NAME="196"></A>the Pehliva of its Shahs, and have endured much pain and toil for their 
<A NAME="197"></A>sakes. And I have not passed a day save in doing that which is right, and 
<A NAME="198"></A>I have purged the land of its enemies. I am the protector of the Kings 
<A NAME="199"></A>of Iran, and the mainstay of the good in all places of the earth. Wherefore 
<A NAME="200"></A>it behoveth thee not to treat me thus disdainfully."
<A NAME="201"></A><BR><BR>Then Isfendiyar said, "O Rustem, be not angered against me, but 
<A NAME="202"></A>listen wherefore I sent not forth to call thee. For the day was hot and 
<A NAME="203"></A>the road long, and I bethought me that fatigue would come upon thee from 
<A NAME="204"></A>this course. Therefore I had resolved to visit thee in the morning. But 
<A NAME="205"></A>since thou hast taken upon thee this fatigue, I pray of thee that thou 
<A NAME="206"></A>rest within my tents, and that we empty the wine-cup 
<A NAME="207"></A>together."
<A NAME="208"></A><BR><BR>Then he made a place for him at his left hand.
<A NAME="209"></A><BR>But Rustem said, "This is not my place. It is not fitting that I should 
<A NAME="210"></A>sit upon thy left, for my seat hath ever been at the right hand of the 
<A NAME="211"></A>Shah."
<A NAME="212"></A><BR><BR>Then Isfendiyar bade a chair of gold be brought, and he caused 
<A NAME="213"></A>it to be placed upon his right, and he bade Rustem be seated upon it. And 
<A NAME="214"></A>Rustem sat him down, but he was angered in his spirit because of the dishonour 
<A NAME="215"></A>that Isfendiyar had shown unto him.
<A NAME="216"></A><BR><BR>Now when they had drunk together awhile, Isfendiyar lifted up his 
<A NAME="217"></A>voice and said-
<A NAME="218"></A><BR><BR>"O Rustem, it hath been told unto me that thine origin is evil, 
<A NAME="219"></A>for thou art sprung from a Deev whom Saum cast forth from his house. And 
<A NAME="220"></A>he was reared of a vile bird, and his nourishment was 
<A NAME="221"></A>garbage."
<A NAME="222"></A><BR><BR>Then Rustem said, "Why speakest thou words that do hurt?" And he 
<A NAME="223"></A>told unto him of his father, and Saum, and Neriman who was of the race 
<A NAME="224"></A>of Husheng the Shah. And he vaunted the great deeds done of his house, 
<A NAME="225"></A>and he hid not that which he had accomplished himself, and he 
<A NAME="226"></A>said-
<A NAME="227"></A><BR><BR>"Six hundred years have passed since I came forth from the loins 
<A NAME="228"></A>of Zal, and for that space I have been the Pehliva of the world, and have 
<A NAME="229"></A>feared neither that which was manifest, nor that which was hid. And I speak 
<A NAME="230"></A>these things that thou mayest know. Thou art the King, and they that carry 
<A NAME="231"></A>high their heads are thy subjects, but thou art new unto the world, wherefore 
<A NAME="232"></A>thou knowest not the things that are come to pass."
<A NAME="233"></A><BR><BR>When Isfendiyar had listened unto the words of Rustem, he smiled 
<A NAME="234"></A>and spake, saying-
<A NAME="235"></A><BR><BR>"I have given ear unto thy voice, give ear now also unto the words 
<A NAME="236"></A>that I shall speak."
<A NAME="237"></A><BR><BR>Then he vaunted him of his forefathers, and he recounted unto Rustem 
<A NAME="238"></A>how that he had overcome the Turks, and how Gushtasp had cast him into 
<A NAME="239"></A>chains, and he told him of the seven stations, and that he had converted 
<A NAME="240"></A>the world unto the faith of Zerdusht. And he said-
<A NAME="241"></A><BR><BR>"We have spoken enough concerning ourselves, let us drink until 
<A NAME="242"></A>we be weary."
<A NAME="243"></A><BR><BR>But Rustem said, "Not so, for thou hast not heard all the deeds 
<A NAME="244"></A>that I have done, for they are many, and the ear sufficeth not to hear 
<A NAME="245"></A>them, nor the mouth to tell. For if thou knewest them, thou wouldest not 
<A NAME="246"></A>exalt thyself above me, or think to cast me into chains."
<A NAME="247"></A><BR><BR>And he recounted to him yet again of his deeds of 
<A NAME="248"></A>might.
<A NAME="249"></A><BR>But Isfendiyar said, "I entreat of thee that thou apply thyself unto 
<A NAME="250"></A>the wine-cup, for verily thou shalt fall tomorrow in the fight, and the 
<A NAME="251"></A>days of thy feasting shall be ended."
<A NAME="252"></A><BR><BR>And Rustem answered, "Boast not thus rashly, thou shalt yet repent 
<A NAME="253"></A>thee of thy words. But to-morrow will we meet in conflict since thou desirest 
<A NAME="254"></A>it, and when I shall have lifted thee from off thy saddle, I will bear 
<A NAME="255"></A>thee unto my house and spread a feast before thee, and pour upon thee my 
<A NAME="256"></A>treasures. And when it shall be done, I will return with thee unto the 
<A NAME="257"></A>courts of the Shah, thy father, and uproot from his spirit this plant of 
<A NAME="258"></A>evil. And when thou shalt be mounted into his seat, I will serve thee with 
<A NAME="259"></A>gladness as thy Pehliva."
<A NAME="260"></A><BR><BR>But Isfendiyar said, "Thy words are idle, and we waste but our 
<A NAME="261"></A>breath in talk of combat. Let us therefore apply us to the 
<A NAME="262"></A>banquet."
<A NAME="263"></A><BR><BR>And they did so, and ate and drank until the night was far spent, 
<A NAME="264"></A>and all men were amazed at the hunger of Rustem.
<A NAME="265"></A><BR><BR>Now when it was time for him to depart, he prayed Isfendiyar yet 
<A NAME="266"></A>again that he would be his guest, and yet again Isfendiyar refused it to 
<A NAME="267"></A>him, and he said-
<A NAME="268"></A><BR><BR>"Suffer that I put chains about thee, and lead thee forth into 
<A NAME="269"></A>Iran, that Gushtasp be satisfied. But if thou wilt not do this thing, I 
<A NAME="270"></A>must attack thee with the spear."
<A NAME="271"></A><BR><BR>Now Rustem, when he heard these words, was sorrowful in his soul. 
<A NAME="272"></A>And he thought within him-
<A NAME="273"></A><BR><BR>"If I suffer these chains it is a stain that cannot be wiped out, 
<A NAME="274"></A>and I cannot outlive my dishonour, for men will mock at Rustem, who permitted 
<A NAME="275"></A>a boy to lead him bound. Yet if I slay this youth, I do evil, for he is 
<A NAME="276"></A>son unto the Shah, and my glory will be tarnished, for men will say I lifted 
<A NAME="277"></A>my hand against a Kaianide. And there can arise no good out of this combat. 
<A NAME="278"></A>Wherefore I will strive yet again to win him unto wisdom."
<A NAME="279"></A><BR><BR>So he lifted up his voice and said, "I pray thee listen not to 
<A NAME="280"></A>the counsel of Deevs, and shut thy lips concerning these chains. For it 
<A NAME="281"></A>seemeth unto me that Gushtasp desireth evil against thee, that he sendeth 
<A NAME="282"></A>thee forth against Rustem, the unvanquished in fight. Dishonour, therefore, 
<A NAME="283"></A>not the champion of thy fathers, but feast within my gates, and let us 
<A NAME="284"></A>ride forth in friendship unto Iran."
<A NAME="285"></A><BR><BR>But Isfendiyar said, "I charge thee, old man, that thou waste not 
<A NAME="286"></A>words concerning this thing, for I will not disobey the behests of my father. 
<A NAME="287"></A>Prepare, therefore, for combat; for to-morrow I will make the world dark 
<A NAME="288"></A>unto thine eyes."
<A NAME="289"></A><BR><BR>Then Rustem said, "O foolish youth! when I grasp my mace, the head 
<A NAME="290"></A>of my foe is lost. Prepare thee rather for thine end."
<A NAME="291"></A><BR><BR>And when he had so spoken, he rode forth from out the tents of 
<A NAME="292"></A>Isfendiyar, and he was exceeding sorrowful. But Isfendiyar smiled after 
<A NAME="293"></A>him and said-
<A NAME="294"></A><BR><BR>"The mother that hath borne thee shall weep. I will cast thee down 
<A NAME="295"></A>from Rakush, I will lead thee bound into Iran."
<A NAME="296"></A><BR><BR>But once again did Bashuntan come before Isfendiyar, and he pleaded 
<A NAME="297"></A>with him for Rustem, and he bade him remember the great deeds that he had 
<A NAME="298"></A>done unto Iran, and he desired him not to lift his hand against the 
<A NAME="299"></A>Pehliva.
<A NAME="300"></A><BR><BR>But Isfendiyar said-
<A NAME="301"></A><BR>"He is a thorn in my rose-garden, and through him alone can I attain 
<A NAME="302"></A>unto the throne. Strive not, therefore, to hinder me, for thy pains will 
<A NAME="303"></A>be in vain. For Zerdusht hath spoken that whosoever honoureth not the behests 
<A NAME="304"></A>of his king, he shall surely suffer the pains of hell. And my father hath 
<A NAME="305"></A>told unto me to do this thing, and though I grieve to do hurt unto Rustem, 
<A NAME="306"></A>the desires of the Shah must be accomplished."
<A NAME="307"></A><BR><BR>Then Bashuntan sighed and said, "Alas! a Deev hath taken possession 
<A NAME="308"></A>of thy spirit."'
<A NAME="309"></A><BR><BR>Now Rustem, when he was come into his house, commanded that his 
<A NAME="310"></A>leopard-skin should be brought before him, and his helmet of Roum, his 
<A NAME="311"></A>spear of Ind also, and the war garb of Rakush. And when he saw them, he 
<A NAME="312"></A>said-
<A NAME="313"></A><BR><BR>"O my raiment of battle, ye have rested a long time from strife, 
<A NAME="314"></A>yet now must I take you forth again to combat, and it is for the hardest 
<A NAME="315"></A>fight that ye have fought. For I must lift my hand against the son of my 
<A NAME="316"></A>master, or suffer that he disgrace me in the sight of 
<A NAME="317"></A>men."
<A NAME="318"></A><BR><BR>And Rustem was sad, and all night he spake unto Zal of his end, 
<A NAME="319"></A>and what he should do if he fell in battle.
<A NAME="320"></A><BR><BR>Then when the morning was come he girded on his armour, but he 
<A NAME="321"></A>resolved in his spirit that he would strive again with Isfendiyar in words. 
<A NAME="322"></A>So he rode forth unto the tents of the young King; and when he was come 
<A NAME="323"></A>nigh unto them he shouted with a loud voice. And he 
<A NAME="324"></A>said-
<A NAME="325"></A><BR><BR>"O Isfendiyar, hero of great renown, the man with whom thou wouldst 
<A NAME="326"></A>wrestle is come forth; make thee ready, therefore, to meet 
<A NAME="327"></A>him."
<A NAME="328"></A><BR><BR>Then Isfendiyar came out from his tents, and he was armed for battle. 
<A NAME="329"></A>Now when they were met, Rustem opened his mouth and prayed him yet again 
<A NAME="330"></A>that he would stay his hand from this impiety. And he 
<A NAME="331"></A>said-
<A NAME="332"></A><BR><BR>"If thy soul thirsteth after blood and the tumult of battle, suffer 
<A NAME="333"></A>that our hosts meet in combat, that thy desires may be 
<A NAME="334"></A>satisfied."
<A NAME="335"></A><BR><BR>But Isfendiyar said, "Thy talk is folly; thou art armed for the 
<A NAME="336"></A>conflict, let not the hours be lost."
<A NAME="337"></A><BR><BR>Then Rustem sighed and made him ready for combat. And he assailed 
<A NAME="338"></A>Isfendiyar with his lance, but with a nimble stroke Isfendiyar resisted 
<A NAME="339"></A>his attack. And they fought with their lances until they were bent, and 
<A NAME="340"></A>when that was done they betook them unto swords. And ever the heroes parried 
<A NAME="341"></A>the strokes that were dealt. And when their swords were broken they seized 
<A NAME="342"></A>upon maces, but either hero warded off the blows. And they fought until 
<A NAME="343"></A>that their shields were rent and their helmets dinted with the blows, and 
<A NAME="344"></A>their armour was pierced in many places. And it was a bitter fight. But 
<A NAME="345"></A>the end thereof came not, and they were weary, and neither had gained the 
<A NAME="346"></A>upper hand. So they rested them awhile from combat. But when they were 
<A NAME="347"></A>rested they fell again one on another, and they fought with arrows and 
<A NAME="348"></A>bows. And the arrows of Isfendiyar whizzed through the air and fastened 
<A NAME="349"></A>into the body of Rustem and of Rakush his steed; and twice thirty ar-rows 
<A NAME="350"></A>did Isfendiyar thus send forth, until that Rakush was like to perish from 
<A NAME="351"></A>his wounds. And Rustem also was covered with gore, and no man before this 
<A NAME="352"></A>one had ever done harm unto his body. But the arrows of Rustem had done 
<A NAME="353"></A>no ill unto Isfendiyar, because Zerdusht had charmed his body against all 
<A NAME="354"></A>dangers, so that it was like unto brass.
<A NAME="355"></A><BR><BR>Now Isfendiyar, when he beheld that Rustem staggered in his seat, 
<A NAME="356"></A>called out unto him to surrender himself into his hands and suffer chains 
<A NAME="357"></A>to be put about his body. But Rustem said-
<A NAME="358"></A><BR><BR>"Not so, I will meet thee again in the morning," and he turned 
<A NAME="359"></A>and swam across the stream, so that Isfendiyar was amazed, for he knew 
<A NAME="360"></A>that the steed and rider had been sore wounded. And he exulted in his heart, 
<A NAME="361"></A>and he reviled Rustem with his lips, but in his soul he was filled with 
<A NAME="362"></A>wonder at the Pehliva, and his heart went out to him.
<A NAME="363"></A><BR><BR>Now when Zal and Rudabeh beheld the Pehliva and that he was wounded, 
<A NAME="364"></A>they rent the air with their cries, for never yet was he returned unto 
<A NAME="365"></A>them vanquished, neither had any man done hurt unto the elephant-limbed. 
<A NAME="366"></A>And they wailed sore in their distress, and Rustem joined his lamentations 
<A NAME="367"></A>unto theirs. Then they pondered how they should act, and Zal bethought 
<A NAME="368"></A>him of the Simurgh that had been his nurse, and the feather that she had 
<A NAME="369"></A>given him from her breast that he might call upon her in the day of his 
<A NAME="370"></A>need. So he brought it and cast it into the fire as she had commanded, 
<A NAME="371"></A>and straightway a sound of rushing wings filled the air and the sky was 
<A NAME="372"></A>darkened, and the bird of God stood before Zal. And she spake and said 
<A NAME="373"></A>unto him-
<A NAME="374"></A><BR><BR>"O my son, what is come about that thou callest upon thy nurse 
<A NAME="375"></A>that shielded thee?"
<A NAME="376"></A><BR><BR>Then Zal told her all, and how Rustem was nigh to die of his wounds, 
<A NAME="377"></A>and how Rakush too was sick unto death. Then the Simurgh 
<A NAME="378"></A>said-
<A NAME="379"></A><BR><BR>"Bring me before them."
<A NAME="380"></A><BR>And when she had seen them, she passed her wings over their hurts and 
<A NAME="381"></A>forthwith they were whole. Then she spake unto Rustem and questioned him 
<A NAME="382"></A>wherefore he sought to combat the son of the Shah, and Rustem told her. 
<A NAME="383"></A>Then she said-
<A NAME="384"></A><BR><BR>"Seek yet again to turn Isfendiyar unto thyself; yet if he listen 
<A NAME="385"></A>not unto thy voice, I will reveal unto thee the secrets of Fate. For it 
<A NAME="386"></A>is written that whosoever sheddeth the blood of Isfendiyar, he also shall 
<A NAME="387"></A>perish; and while he liveth he shall not know joy, and in the life to come 
<A NAME="388"></A>he shall suffer pains. But if this fate dismay thee not, go forth with 
<A NAME="389"></A>me and I will teach thee this night how thou shalt close the mouth of thine 
<A NAME="390"></A>enemy."
<A NAME="391"></A><BR><BR>Then the Simurgh showed unto Rustem the way he should follow, and 
<A NAME="392"></A>Rustem rode after her, and they halted not until they were come unto the 
<A NAME="393"></A>sea-coast. And the Simurgh led him into a garden wherein grew a tamarisk, 
<A NAME="394"></A>tall and strong, and the roots thereof were in the ground, but the branches 
<A NAME="395"></A>pierced even unto the sky. Then the bird of God bade Rustem break from 
<A NAME="396"></A>the tree a branch that was long and slender, and fashion it into an arrow, 
<A NAME="397"></A>and she said-
<A NAME="398"></A><BR><BR>"Only through his eyes can Isfendiyar be wounded. If, therefore, 
<A NAME="399"></A>thou wouldst slay him, direct this arrow unto his forehead, and verily 
<A NAME="400"></A>it shall not miss its aim."
<A NAME="401"></A><BR><BR>Then she exhorted him once more that he bring this matter to a 
<A NAME="402"></A>good end, and she led him on the path of return unto Zaboulistan, and when 
<A NAME="403"></A>he was come there she blessed him and departed from out his 
<A NAME="404"></A>sight.
<A NAME="405"></A><BR><BR>Now when the morning was come, Rustem came unto the camp of Isfendiyar, 
<A NAME="406"></A>and he was mounted upon Rakush his steed. And Isfendiyar slumbered, for 
<A NAME="407"></A>he thought that of a surety Rustem was perished of his wounds. Then Rustem 
<A NAME="408"></A>lifted up his voice, and cried-
<A NAME="409"></A><BR><BR>"O man, eager to fight, wherefore slumberest thou when Rustem standeth 
<A NAME="410"></A>before thee?"
<A NAME="411"></A><BR><BR>Now Isfendiyar, when he heard his voice and saw that it was truly 
<A NAME="412"></A>Rustem that stood before him, was amazed, and he said unto his 
<A NAME="413"></A>nobles-
<A NAME="414"></A><BR><BR>"This is the deed of Zal the sorcerer."
<A NAME="415"></A><BR>But unto Rustem he cried, "Make ready for combat; for this day thou 
<A NAME="416"></A>shalt not escape my might. May thy name perish from off the 
<A NAME="417"></A>earth."
<A NAME="418"></A><BR><BR>Then Rustem spake, saying-
<A NAME="419"></A><BR>"I am not come forth to battle, but to treaty. Turn aside thine heart 
<A NAME="420"></A>from evil, and root out this enmity. Make not, I pray thee, thy soul to 
<A NAME="421"></A>be a dwelling-place for Deevs. And suffer that I recall unto thee the deeds 
<A NAME="422"></A>I have done for Iran, and the list thereof is long. And feast this day 
<A NAME="423"></A>within my house, and let us ride forth together unto the courts of the 
<A NAME="424"></A>Shah, that I may make my peace with Gushtasp thy father."
<A NAME="425"></A><BR><BR>But Isfendiyar was angered at these words, and he 
<A NAME="426"></A>said-
<A NAME="427"></A><BR>"Wilt thou never cease from speaking? Thou exhortest me to quit the 
<A NAME="428"></A>paths of God, for I do wrong when I obey not the voice of my father. Choose, 
<A NAME="429"></A>therefore, betwixt chains and the combat."
<A NAME="430"></A><BR><BR>When Isfendiyar had so spoken, Rustem knew that his speech was 
<A NAME="431"></A>of no avail. So he sighed and made ready for combat; and he took forth 
<A NAME="432"></A>the arrow that was given to him of the Simurgh, and he let it fly towards 
<A NAME="433"></A>his enemy. And it pierced the eye of the young King, and he fell upon the 
<A NAME="434"></A>mane of his steed, and his blood reddened the field of battle. Then Rustem 
<A NAME="435"></A>said unto him-
<A NAME="436"></A><BR><BR>"The bitter harvest thou hast sown hath borne 
<A NAME="437"></A>fruit."
<A NAME="438"></A><BR>Now Isfendiyar swooned in his agony and fell upon the ground. And there 
<A NAME="439"></A>came out to him his brother and Bahman, his son; and they wailed when they 
<A NAME="440"></A>beheld how his plight was evil. But when he was come unto himself he called 
<A NAME="441"></A>after Rustem, and the Pehliva got him down from Rakush and came unto where 
<A NAME="442"></A>he lay, and knelt beside him. And Isfendiyar said-
<A NAME="443"></A><BR><BR>"My life ebbeth unto the close, wherefore I would confide unto 
<A NAME="444"></A>thee my wishes. And thou shalt behold how greatly I honour thee, for it 
<A NAME="445"></A>is not thou that hast brought me unto death, but Gushtasp, my father; and 
<A NAME="446"></A>verily the curse of the prophet shall fall upon his head, for thou wert 
<A NAME="447"></A>but the instrument of Fate. And listen now unto the words that I shall 
<A NAME="448"></A>speak, for it is not given unto me to say many- I desire that thou take 
<A NAME="449"></A>unto thyself Bahman, my son, and that thou rear him in the land of Zaboulistan, 
<A NAME="450"></A>and that thou teach him the arts of war and of the banquet. And when the 
<A NAME="451"></A>hour of Gushtasp shall be come, I charge thee that thou put Bahman in his 
<A NAME="452"></A>place, and aid him with thy counsels that he may be upright in the sight 
<A NAME="453"></A>of men."
<A NAME="454"></A><BR><BR>And Rustem sware unto him that it should be done at his desire. 
<A NAME="455"></A>Then Isfendiyar made him ready to depart, and he spake words of comfort 
<A NAME="456"></A>unto his son, and he sent greetings unto his mother and to his wives that 
<A NAME="457"></A>were in Iran. And he made them say unto his father that hence-forward he 
<A NAME="458"></A>need not fear him beside the throne; and he cursed the name of Gushtasp, 
<A NAME="459"></A>and he said that the Shah had done that which was worthy of his black soul. 
<A NAME="460"></A>And he bade them speak before the throne and say-
<A NAME="461"></A><BR><BR>"We shall meet again before the judge, and we shall speak, and 
<A NAME="462"></A>listen to His decree."
<A NAME="463"></A><BR><BR>Then he said unto Rustem, "Thou hast done this deed by the arts 
<A NAME="464"></A>of magic."
<A NAME="465"></A><BR><BR>And Rustem said, "It is true, for thou wouldst not listen unto 
<A NAME="466"></A>my voice, and I could not bend my spirit unto chains."
<A NAME="467"></A><BR><BR>And Isfendiyar said, "I am not angered against thee; thou hast 
<A NAME="468"></A>done that thou couldst not alter, for it was written in the stars, and 
<A NAME="469"></A>surely that which is written in the stars is accomplished."
<A NAME="470"></A><BR><BR>Then Rustem said, "God is my witness that I strove to turn thee 
<A NAME="471"></A>from thy resolve."
<A NAME="472"></A><BR><BR>And Isfendiyar said, "It is known unto me." And when he had thus 
<A NAME="473"></A>spoken he sighed, and the sun of that King was set. And there was great 
<A NAME="474"></A>lamentation for him in the army, and Rustem, too, bewailed the hero that 
<A NAME="475"></A>was fallen, and he prayed God for his soul. And he said-
<A NAME="476"></A><BR><BR>"May thine enemies reap that which they have 
<A NAME="477"></A>sown."
<A NAME="478"></A><BR>Then Rustem made ready for Isfendiyar a coffin of iron, and he caused 
<A NAME="479"></A>it to be lined with silken stuffs, and he laid therein the body of the 
<A NAME="480"></A>young King. And it was placed upon the back of a dromedary and forty others 
<A NAME="481"></A>followed in its wake, and all the army of Isfendiyar came after them, clad 
<A NAME="482"></A>in robes of mourning. And Bashuntan marched at the head of the train, and 
<A NAME="483"></A>he led the horse of Isfendiyar, and its saddle was reversed, and its mane 
<A NAME="484"></A>and its tail were shorn. And from its sides hung the armour of the young 
<A NAME="485"></A>King. And weeping resounded through the ranks, and with sorrow did the 
<A NAME="486"></A>army return unto Iran.
<A NAME="487"></A><BR><BR>But Rustem remained in Zaboulistan, and he kept beside him Bahman, 
<A NAME="488"></A>the son of Isfendiyar.
<A NAME="489"></A><BR><BR>Now when Gushtasp learned the tidings of woe, he was bowed down 
<A NAME="490"></A>to the earth with sorrow, and remorse came upon him and he strewed dust 
<A NAME="491"></A>upon his head and he humbled himself before God. And men came before him 
<A NAME="492"></A>and reproached him with that which he had done unto Isfendiyar, and he 
<A NAME="493"></A>knew not how he should answer them. And Bashuntan came in and saluted him 
<A NAME="494"></A>not, but upbraided him with his vile deeds. And he said-
<A NAME="495"></A><BR><BR>"Neither the Simurgh, nor Rustem, nor Zal have made an end of Isfendiyar, 
<A NAME="496"></A>but only thou, for thou alone hast caused him to perish."
<A NAME="497"></A><BR><BR>And for the space of one year men ceased not to lament for Isfendiyar, 
<A NAME="498"></A>and for many years were tears shed for that arrow. And men cried continually, 
<A NAME="499"></A>"The glory of Iran hath been laid low, and it is at the hands of her Shah 
<A NAME="500"></A>that it hath been done."
<A NAME="501"></A><BR><BR>But Bahman grew up in the courts of Rustem, and the Pehliva guarded 
<A NAME="502"></A>him like to a son.
