<A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A>In a little time it came about that there was born unto Ferangis, in the 
<A NAME="11"></A>house of Piran, a son of the race of Saiawush. And Piran, when he had seen 
<A NAME="12"></A>the babe, goodly of mien, who already in his cradle was like unto a king, 
<A NAME="13"></A>sware a great oath that Afrasiyab should not destroy it. And when he went 
<A NAME="14"></A>before the King to tell unto him the tidings, he pleaded for him with his 
<A NAME="15"></A>lips. Now the heart of Afrasiyab had been softened in his sorrow for Saiawush, 
<A NAME="16"></A>wherefore he shut his ear unto the evil counsellors that bade him destroy 
<A NAME="17"></A>the babe which should bring vengeance upon Turan. And he 
<A NAME="18"></A>said-
<A NAME="19"></A><BR><BR>" I repent me of mine evil deed unto Saiawush, and though it be 
<A NAME="20"></A>written that much evil shall come upon me from this child sprung from the 
<A NAME="21"></A>loins of Tur and Kai Kobad, I will strive no more to hinder the decree 
<A NAME="22"></A>of the stars; let him, therefore, be reared unto manhood. Yet I pray that 
<A NAME="23"></A>he be brought up among shepherds in the mountains far from the haunts of 
<A NAME="24"></A>men, and that his birth be hidden from him, that he may not learn of his 
<A NAME="25"></A>father or of the cruel things I did unto Saiawush."
<A NAME="26"></A><BR><BR>And Piran consented unto the desires of Afrasiyab, and he rejoiced 
<A NAME="27"></A>because he had spared the babe. Then he took the infant from its mother 
<A NAME="28"></A>and bare it unto the mountains of Kalun, and confided the boy unto the 
<A NAME="29"></A>shepherds of the flocks. And he said-
<A NAME="30"></A><BR><BR>"Guard this child even as your souls, so that neither rain nor 
<A NAME="31"></A>dust come near him."
<A NAME="32"></A><BR><BR>Thus it came about that no man knew of the babe, neither did Ferangis 
<A NAME="33"></A>know whither it was vanished. But oftentimes was Piran sore disturbed in 
<A NAME="34"></A>his spirit, for he knew that the beginning of strife was yet to come, and 
<A NAME="35"></A>that much evil must befall Turan from this infant. Yet he forgot not his 
<A NAME="36"></A>promise of protection given unto Saiawush his friend, whom he had led to 
<A NAME="37"></A>put his trust in Afrasiyab. So he quieted his spirit from thinking, for 
<A NAME="38"></A>he knew that no man can change the course of the stars.
<A NAME="39"></A><BR><BR>Now when some time was passed the shepherds came out to Piran and 
<A NAME="40"></A>told him how they could not restrain this boy, whose valour was like to 
<A NAME="41"></A>that of a king. Then Piran went forth to visit Kai Khosrau, and he was 
<A NAME="42"></A>amazed when he looked upon him and beheld his beauty and his strength, 
<A NAME="43"></A>and he pressed him unto his heart with tenderness. Then Kai Khosrau 
<A NAME="44"></A>said-
<A NAME="45"></A><BR><BR>"O thou that bearest high thy head, art thou not ashamed to press 
<A NAME="46"></A>unto thee the son of a shepherd? "
<A NAME="47"></A><BR><BR>But Piran was inflamed with love for the boy, so he pondered not 
<A NAME="48"></A>his words, but said-
<A NAME="49"></A><BR><BR>"O heir of kings, thou art not the son of a shepherd." Then he 
<A NAME="50"></A>told him of his birth, and clad him in robes befitting his station, and 
<A NAME="51"></A>took him back with him unto his house. And henceforward was Kai Khosrau 
<A NAME="52"></A>reared in the bosom of Piran and of Ferangis his mother. And the days rolled 
<A NAME="53"></A>above their heads in happiness.
<A NAME="54"></A><BR><BR>Then it came about one night that Piran was awakened by a messenger 
<A NAME="55"></A>from Afrasiyab the King. And the King bade Piran come before him. And when 
<A NAME="56"></A>he was come unto him, he said-
<A NAME="57"></A><BR><BR>"My heart is disquieted because of the child of Saiawush, and I 
<A NAME="58"></A>repent me of my weakness which kept him alive; for in my dreams I have 
<A NAME="59"></A>beheld that he will do much evil unto Turan. Wherefore I would now slay 
<A NAME="60"></A>him to avert calamity."
<A NAME="61"></A><BR><BR>Then Piran, wise in counsel, opened his mouth before Afrasiyab 
<A NAME="62"></A>and spake, saying-
<A NAME="63"></A><BR><BR>"O King, disquiet not thyself because of this boy, for he is devoid 
<A NAME="64"></A>of wit; and though his face be like unto that of a Peri, his head, which 
<A NAME="65"></A>should bear a crown, is empty of reason. Commit, therefore, no violence, 
<A NAME="66"></A>but suffer that this innocent continue to dwell among the 
<A NAME="67"></A>flocks."
<A NAME="68"></A><BR><BR>Afrasiyab, when he had listened to these words of wile, was comforted; 
<A NAME="69"></A>yet he said-
<A NAME="70"></A><BR><BR>"Send Kai Khosrau before me, that I may behold with mine eyes his 
<A NAME="71"></A>simplicity."
<A NAME="72"></A><BR><BR>And Piran assented to his request, because he ventured not to gainsay 
<A NAME="73"></A>it. So he returned him unto his house and sought out the boy, and told 
<A NAME="74"></A>him how he should disguise his wit before the King. Then he led him unto 
<A NAME="75"></A>the court mounted upon a goodly charger, and all the people shouted when 
<A NAME="76"></A>they beheld his beauty and his kingly mien. And Afrasiyab too was confounded 
<A NAME="77"></A>at his aspect, and he gazed with wonder at his limbs of power, and he strove 
<A NAME="78"></A>to remember the promise that he had given unto Piran that he would not 
<A NAME="79"></A>hurt a hair of the head of this boy. Then he began to question him that 
<A NAME="80"></A>he might search his spirit. And he said-
<A NAME="81"></A><BR><BR>"Young shepherd, how knowest thou the day from the night? What 
<A NAME="82"></A>doest thou with thy flocks? How countest thou thy sheep and thy 
<A NAME="83"></A>goats?"
<A NAME="84"></A><BR><BR>And Kai Khosrau replied-
<A NAME="85"></A><BR>"There is no game, and I have neither cords nor bow and 
<A NAME="86"></A>arrows."
<A NAME="87"></A><BR>Then the King questioned him concerning the milk that was given of 
<A NAME="88"></A>the herds. And Kai Khosrau said-
<A NAME="89"></A><BR><BR>"The tiger-cats are dangerous and have mighty 
<A NAME="90"></A>claws."
<A NAME="91"></A><BR>Then Afrasiyab put to him yet a third question, and he asked of 
<A NAME="92"></A>him-
<A NAME="93"></A><BR><BR>"What is the name of thy mother?"
<A NAME="94"></A><BR>And Kai Khosrau answered and said-"
<A NAME="95"></A><BR>"The dog ventureth not to bark when a lion threateneth 
<A NAME="96"></A>him."
<A NAME="97"></A><BR>Then Afrasiyab asked him yet again whether he desired to go forth into 
<A NAME="98"></A>the land of Iran and be avenged upon his enemies. And Kai Khosrau answered 
<A NAME="99"></A>and said-
<A NAME="100"></A><BR><BR>"When a leopard appeareth, the heart of a brave man is torn with 
<A NAME="101"></A>fear."
<A NAME="102"></A><BR><BR>And Afrasiyab smiled at these answers and questioned him no further. 
<A NAME="103"></A>And he said unto Piran-
<A NAME="104"></A><BR><BR>"Restore the boy unto his mother, and let him be reared with kindness 
<A NAME="105"></A>in the city that Saiawush hath builded, for I behold that from him can 
<A NAME="106"></A>no harm alight upon Turan."
<A NAME="107"></A><BR><BR>When Piran heard these words he hastened to remove Kai Khosrau 
<A NAME="108"></A>from the court, and his heart was glad because of the danger that had passed 
<A NAME="109"></A>by. So Kai Khosrau was reared in the house of his father, and Ferangis 
<A NAME="110"></A>spake unto him of Saiawush and of the vengeance that was due. And she instructed 
<A NAME="111"></A>him concerning the heroes of Iran and their deeds of prowess, as she had 
<A NAME="112"></A>learned them from Saiawush her lord.
<A NAME="113"></A><BR><BR>In the mean season Kai Kaous had learned of the death of Saiawush 
<A NAME="114"></A>his son, and a mighty wailing went forth throughout the land of Iran, so 
<A NAME="115"></A>that even the nightingale in the cypress was silent of her song, and the 
<A NAME="116"></A>leaves of the pomegranate tree in the forest were withered for sorrow. 
<A NAME="117"></A>And the heroes that stood about the throne of Kai Kaous clad themselves 
<A NAME="118"></A>in the garb of woe, and bare dust upon their heads in place of helmets. 
<A NAME="119"></A>And Rustem, when he learned of it, was bowed to the earth with agony, and 
<A NAME="120"></A>for seven days he stirred not from the ground, neither would he let food 
<A NAME="121"></A>or comfort come near him. But on the eighth he roused him from the earth, 
<A NAME="122"></A>and caused the trumpets of brass to be sounded into the air. And he assembled 
<A NAME="123"></A>his warriors, and marched with them into Iran, and he came before Kai Kaous 
<A NAME="124"></A>and demanded audience.
<A NAME="125"></A><BR><BR>Now when he was come into the presence-chamber he found the Shah 
<A NAME="126"></A>seated upon his throne. He was clothed in dust from his head unto his feet, 
<A NAME="127"></A>because of his grief. But Rustem regarded it not, and straightway reproached 
<A NAME="128"></A>him, and said-
<A NAME="129"></A><BR><BR>"O King of evil nature, behold the harvest that is sprung from 
<A NAME="130"></A>the seed that thou didst sow! The love of Sudaveh and her vile intents 
<A NAME="131"></A>have torn from off thy head the diadem of kings, and Iran hath suffered 
<A NAME="132"></A>cruel loss because of thy folly and thy suspicions. It is better for a 
<A NAME="133"></A>king that he be laid within his shroud than that he be given over to the 
<A NAME="134"></A>dominion of a woman. Alas for Saiawush! Was ever hero like unto him? And 
<A NAME="135"></A>henceforward I will know neither rest nor joy until his cruel death be 
<A NAME="136"></A>avenged."
<A NAME="137"></A><BR><BR>When Kai Kaous had listened to the words of his Pehliva, the colour 
<A NAME="138"></A>of shame mounted into his cheek, but he held his peace, for he knew that 
<A NAME="139"></A>the words spoken of Rustem were deserved. Then Rustem, when he saw that 
<A NAME="140"></A>the King answered him not, strode out from his presence. And he went into 
<A NAME="141"></A>the house of the women, and sought for Sudaveh, who had given over Saiawush 
<A NAME="142"></A>unto death. And when he had found her, he tore her from off her throne, 
<A NAME="143"></A>and he plunged his dagger into her heart, and he quitted her not until 
<A NAME="144"></A>the life was gone from her. And Kai Kaous, when he learned it, trembled 
<A NAME="145"></A>and was afraid, for he dared not oppose himself unto Rustem. Then Rustem 
<A NAME="146"></A>commanded that the army of vengeance be made ready. And he 
<A NAME="147"></A>said-
<A NAME="148"></A><BR><BR>"I will make the earth to tremble before my mace, as it shall tremble 
<A NAME="149"></A>on the day of judgment."
<A NAME="150"></A><BR><BR>And when all was prepared they made them haste to be gone, and 
<A NAME="151"></A>the air was full of the gleaming of armour, and the rattling of drums was 
<A NAME="152"></A>heard on all sides.
<A NAME="153"></A><BR><BR>Now when Afrasiyab learned that a great army was come forth from 
<A NAME="154"></A>Iran to avenge the death of Saiawush, he bade Sarkha, the best beloved 
<A NAME="155"></A>of his sons, lead forth the hosts of Turan against them. But he craved 
<A NAME="156"></A>Sarkha have a care that Rustem, the son of Zal, put not his life in danger. 
<A NAME="157"></A>And Sarkha set forth, bearing aloft the black banner of Turan, and he went 
<A NAME="158"></A>towards the plains where Rustem was encamped. Now when the armies beheld 
<A NAME="159"></A>one another, their hearts were inflamed, and the battle raged sore, and 
<A NAME="160"></A>many were the brave heads laid low on that day. And Sarkha fell into the 
<A NAME="161"></A>hands of Rustem, and he spared him not, because he was the best beloved 
<A NAME="162"></A>son of Afrasiyab. So he gave orders that Sarkha be slain, even as Saiawush 
<A NAME="163"></A>was slain, that the heart of his enemy might be rent with 
<A NAME="164"></A>anguish.
<A NAME="165"></A><BR><BR>And when Afrasiyab learned it he was beside himself with grief. 
<A NAME="166"></A>And when he had torn his hair and wailed in the dust for his son, he arose 
<A NAME="167"></A>to go forth unto the army, that he might avenge his death. And he said 
<A NAME="168"></A>unto his knights-
<A NAME="169"></A><BR><BR>"Henceforth ye must not think of sleep or hunger, neither must 
<A NAME="170"></A>ye breathe aught but vengeance, for I will never stay my hand until this 
<A NAME="171"></A>murder be avenged."
<A NAME="172"></A><BR><BR>Now when the army that was with Afrasiyab came nigh unto Rustem, 
<A NAME="173"></A>Pilsam, that was brother to Piran, a warrior valiant and true, challenged 
<A NAME="174"></A>Rustem unto single combat. Then Piran sought to stay him because of his 
<A NAME="175"></A>youth, but Pilsam listened not unto his counsel. So Rustem came forth against 
<A NAME="176"></A>him, and he was armed with a stout lance, and he was wrapped about with 
<A NAME="177"></A>his anger. And he fell upon Pilsam with fury, and he lifted him from his 
<A NAME="178"></A>saddle, and he took him by the girdle and flung him, as a thing that is 
<A NAME="179"></A>vile, into the midst of the camp of the Turanians. Then he shouted with 
<A NAME="180"></A>a voice of thunder-
<A NAME="181"></A><BR><BR>"I counsel you, wrap ye this man in robes of gold, for my mace 
<A NAME="182"></A>hath made him blue."
<A NAME="183"></A><BR><BR>Now when the Turanians beheld that Pilsam was dead, they wept sore, 
<A NAME="184"></A>and their courage departed from out of them. And in vain did Afrasiyab 
<A NAME="185"></A>pray them to keep their hearts. Yet he said within himself-
<A NAME="186"></A><BR><BR>"The good fortune that watched over me is asleep."
<A NAME="187"></A><BR>And when they were met in battle yet again, and the army of Rustem 
<A NAME="188"></A>had beaten down once more that of Afrasiyab, the King bethought him of 
<A NAME="189"></A>flight. And the hosts of Turan vanished like to the wind, but they left 
<A NAME="190"></A>behind them much riches and goodly treasure.
<A NAME="191"></A><BR><BR>Now while they were flying from the face of Rustem, Afrasiyab said 
<A NAME="192"></A>unto Piran-
<A NAME="193"></A><BR><BR>"Counsel me how I shall act concerning this child of 
<A NAME="194"></A>Saiawush."
<A NAME="195"></A><BR>And Piran said, "Haste not to put him to death, for he shall in nowise 
<A NAME="196"></A>do thee hurt. But if thou wilt listen unto my voice, send him far into 
<A NAME="197"></A>Khoten, that he be hidden from sight, and that the men of Iran learn not 
<A NAME="198"></A>of his being."
<A NAME="199"></A><BR><BR>And Afrasiyab did as Piran counselled, and a messenger was sent 
<A NAME="200"></A>forth to lead out the young King and his mother unto the land of Cathay. 
<A NAME="201"></A>And Afrasiyab himself fled until that he came within the borders of China, 
<A NAME="202"></A>and no man knew where he was hidden. And the land of Turan was given over 
<A NAME="203"></A>to plunder, and the Iranians scathed it with fire and sword because of 
<A NAME="204"></A>Saiawush, whom Afrasiyab had foully slain. And Rustem seated himself in 
<A NAME="205"></A>the seat of Afrasiyab, and for the space of seven years did he rule over 
<A NAME="206"></A>the land. But in the eighth messengers came out to him, and said how that 
<A NAME="207"></A>Kai Kaous was without a guide in Iran, and how they feared lest folly might 
<A NAME="208"></A>result from his deeds. So Rustem went forth to stand beside his 
<A NAME="209"></A>Shah.
<A NAME="210"></A><BR><BR>Now when Afrasiyab learned that Rustem was departed out of the 
<A NAME="211"></A>land of Turan, his fears forsook him, and he gathered together a mighty 
<A NAME="212"></A>army, and he fell upon his borders, and he regained them unto himself. 
<A NAME="213"></A>And he wept when he beheld the havoc that was come upon Turan, and he incited 
<A NAME="214"></A>his army to be avenged. So they fell into Iran, and shattered its host, 
<A NAME="215"></A>and they suffered not that repose come near unto their foes. And they pursued 
<A NAME="216"></A>them with fire and sword, and laid waste their fields. And during seven 
<A NAME="217"></A>years the heavens withheld their rains, and good fortune was turned away 
<A NAME="218"></A>from Iran, and the prosperity of the land was quenched. And men groaned 
<A NAME="219"></A>sore under these misfortunes, neither did Rustem come forth from Zaboulistan 
<A NAME="220"></A>unto their aid.
<A NAME="221"></A><BR><BR>Then it came about one night that Gudarz, who was descended from 
<A NAME="222"></A>Kawah the smith, dreamed a dream. He beheld a cloud heavy with rain, and 
<A NAME="223"></A>on the cloud was seated the Serosch the blessed. And the angel of God said 
<A NAME="224"></A>unto Gudarz-
<A NAME="225"></A><BR><BR>"Open thine ears, if thou wilt deliver thy land from anguish, and 
<A NAME="226"></A>from Afrasiyab the Turk. There abideth in Turan the son of a noble race, 
<A NAME="227"></A>an issue sprung from the loins of Saiawush, who is brave, and beareth high 
<A NAME="228"></A>his head. And he is sprung from Kai Kobad and from Tur, and from him alone 
<A NAME="229"></A>can deliverance come to Iran. Suffer, therefore, that Gew, thy son, go 
<A NAME="230"></A>forth in search of Kai Khosrau, and bid him remain in his saddle until 
<A NAME="231"></A>he shall have found this boy. For such is the will of 
<A NAME="232"></A>Ormuzd."
<A NAME="233"></A><BR><BR>When Gudarz awoke, he thanked God for his dream, and touched the 
<A NAME="234"></A>ground with his white beard. And when the sun was risen and had chased 
<A NAME="235"></A>away the ravens of night, he called before him his son, and he spake to 
<A NAME="236"></A>him of his dream. And he commanded him that he go forth to do the behests 
<A NAME="237"></A>of God.
<A NAME="238"></A><BR><BR>And Gew said, "I will obey thine orders while I 
<A NAME="239"></A>live."
<A NAME="240"></A><BR>Then Gudarz said, "What companions wilt thou take with 
<A NAME="241"></A>thee?
<A NAME="242"></A><BR>And Gew said, "My cord and my horse will suffice unto me for company, 
<A NAME="243"></A>for it is best to take none with me into Turan. For behold, if I lead out 
<A NAME="244"></A>an host, men will ask what I am, and wherefore I come forth; but if I go 
<A NAME="245"></A>alone, their doubts will slumber."
<A NAME="246"></A><BR><BR>Then Gudarz said, "Go, and peace be upon thee."
<A NAME="247"></A><BR>So Gew made ready his steed, and when he had bidden farewell unto the 
<A NAME="248"></A>old man his father, he set out upon his travels. And wherever he met a 
<A NAME="249"></A>man walking alone, he questioned him concerning Kai Khosrau; and if the 
<A NAME="250"></A>man knew not the name, he struck off his head, that none might learn his 
<A NAME="251"></A>secret or wherefore he was come forth.
<A NAME="252"></A><BR><BR>Now Gew wandered thus many days throughout the length of Turan, 
<A NAME="253"></A>like to a man distraught, and he could learn nought concerning Kai Khosrau, 
<A NAME="254"></A>the young king. And seven years rolled thus above his head, and he grew 
<A NAME="255"></A>lean and sorrowful. And for house he had nought save only his saddle, and 
<A NAME="256"></A>for nourishment and clothing the flesh and skin of the wild ass, and in 
<A NAME="257"></A>place of wine he had only bad water. And he began to be downcast in his 
<A NAME="258"></A>spirit, and afraid lest the dream dreamed of his father had been sent unto 
<A NAME="259"></A>him by a Deev. Now it came about one day that while he pondered thus he 
<A NAME="260"></A>entered a forest, and when he was come into its midst, he beheld therein 
<A NAME="261"></A>a fountain, and a young man, slim as a cypress, seated beside it. And the 
<A NAME="262"></A>youth held in his hand a wine-cup, and on his head was a crown of flowers, 
<A NAME="263"></A>and his mien was such that the soul of Gew rejoiced thereat, and the door 
<A NAME="264"></A>of his cares was loosened. And he said within himself-
<A NAME="265"></A><BR><BR>"If this be not the King, then must I abandon my search, for I 
<A NAME="266"></A>think to behold in him the face of Saiawush."
<A NAME="267"></A><BR><BR>Then he went nigh unto him.
<A NAME="268"></A><BR>Now when Kai Khosrau beheld the warrior, he smiled and 
<A NAME="269"></A>said-
<A NAME="270"></A><BR>"O Gew, thou art welcome unto my sight, since thou art come hither 
<A NAME="271"></A>at the behest of God. Tell unto me now, I pray thee, tidings of Tus and 
<A NAME="272"></A>Gudarz, of Rustem, and of Kai Kaous the King. Are they happy? Do they know 
<A NAME="273"></A>of Kai Khosrau?"
<A NAME="274"></A><BR><BR>When Gew heard this speech, he was confounded; and when he had 
<A NAME="275"></A>returned thanks unto God, he opened his mouth and spake, 
<A NAME="276"></A>saying-
<A NAME="277"></A><BR><BR>"O young King, who bearest high thy head, reveal unto me who hath 
<A NAME="278"></A>told thee of Gudarz and of Tus, of Rustem and of Kai Kaous, and how knowest 
<A NAME="279"></A>thou my name and aspect."
<A NAME="280"></A><BR><BR>Then Kai Khosrau said, "My mother hath told me of the things which 
<A NAME="281"></A>she learned of my father. For I am son unto Saiawush, and before he entered 
<A NAME="282"></A>upon death he foretold unto Ferangis how Gew would come forth from Iran 
<A NAME="283"></A>to lead me unto the throne."
<A NAME="284"></A><BR><BR>Then Gew said, "Prove unto me thy words. Suffer that mine eyes 
<A NAME="285"></A>behold the mark of the Kaianides which thou bearest about thy 
<A NAME="286"></A>body."
<A NAME="287"></A><BR><BR>Then Kai Khosrau uncovered his arm, and when Gew looked upon the 
<A NAME="288"></A>mark that was borne of all the royal house since the time of Kai Kobad, 
<A NAME="289"></A>he fell down upon the ground and did homage before this youth. But Kai 
<A NAME="290"></A>Khosrau raised him from the dust and embraced him, and questioned him concerning 
<A NAME="291"></A>his journey and the hardships he had passed through. Then Gew mounted the 
<A NAME="292"></A>young King upon his charger, and he walked before him bearing an Indian 
<A NAME="293"></A>sword unsheathed in his hand. And they journeyed until they came to the 
<A NAME="294"></A>city that Saiawush had builded.
<A NAME="295"></A><BR><BR>Now when Ferangis saw them she received them joyfully, for her 
<A NAME="296"></A>quick spirit divined what was come to pass. But she counselled them to 
<A NAME="297"></A>tarry not in whatsoever they would do. For she said-
<A NAME="298"></A><BR><BR>"When Afrasiyab shall learn of this he will neither eat nor sleep, 
<A NAME="299"></A>he will send out an army against us. Let us flee, therefore, before he 
<A NAME="300"></A>cometh. And listen now unto the words that I shall speak. Go forth unto 
<A NAME="301"></A>the mountain that is raised unto the clouds, and take with thee a saddle 
<A NAME="302"></A>and a bridle. And when thou shalt have scaled its crest thou wilt behold 
<A NAME="303"></A>a meadow green as a paradise, and browsing upon it the flocks of Saiawush. 
<A NAME="304"></A>And in their midst will be Behzah the steed of battle. Go nigh unto him, 
<A NAME="305"></A>my son, and embrace him, and whisper thy name into his ear; and when he 
<A NAME="306"></A>shall have heard it he will suffer thee to mount him, and seated upon him 
<A NAME="307"></A>thou shalt escape from the slayer of thy father."
<A NAME="308"></A><BR><BR>Then Gew and Kai Khosrau went out and did as Ferangis told unto 
<A NAME="309"></A>them; and they found the steed, and when Behzah beheld the saddle of Saiawush 
<A NAME="310"></A>and the leopard-skin he had worn, he sighed, and his eyes were filled with 
<A NAME="311"></A>tears. Then he suffered Kai Khosrau to mount him, and they turned back 
<A NAME="312"></A>unto Ferangis. And she chose forth the armour of Saiawush from among her 
<A NAME="313"></A>treasures and gave it to her son, and she clad herself in mail of Roum 
<A NAME="314"></A>like unto a warrior, and she sprang upon a horse of battle, and when all 
<A NAME="315"></A>was done they set forth to fly from the land of Afrasiyab.
<A NAME="316"></A><BR><BR>Now one brought tidings unto Piran of these things, and he was 
<A NAME="317"></A>dismayed thereat, for he said-
<A NAME="318"></A><BR><BR>"Now will be accomplished the fears of Afrasiyab, and mine honour 
<A NAME="319"></A>will be tarnished in his eyes."
<A NAME="320"></A><BR><BR>So he bade Kelbad and three hundred valiant knights pursue Kai 
<A NAME="321"></A>Khosrau and bind him and bring him back in chains.
<A NAME="322"></A><BR><BR>Now Ferangis and her son slept for weariness by the roadside, but 
<A NAME="323"></A>Gew held guard over them. And when he beheld Kelbad and the men that were 
<A NAME="324"></A>with him, he knew that they were come in pursuit; yet he awakened not Kai 
<A NAME="325"></A>Khosrau, but of his strength alone put them to flight. But when they were 
<A NAME="326"></A>gone he roused the sleepers, and he urged haste upon 
<A NAME="327"></A>them.
<A NAME="328"></A><BR><BR>But Piran, when he beheld that Kelbad returned unto him defeated 
<A NAME="329"></A>at the hand of one man, was loath to credit it, and he was angered against 
<A NAME="330"></A>him, and said that he would go forth himself. So Piran made him ready, 
<A NAME="331"></A>and a thousand brave warriors went with him. For Piran was afraid of the 
<A NAME="332"></A>anger of Afrasiyab, and that he would put this flight unto his account, 
<A NAME="333"></A>and not unto that of the rotation of the stars. Now when he was come unto 
<A NAME="334"></A>the fugitives Gew and the young King slumbered, but Ferangis was keeping 
<A NAME="335"></A>watch. And when she beheld the army she woke them and bade them prepare 
<A NAME="336"></A>for combat; but Gew suffered not that Kai Khosrau should go forth, for 
<A NAME="337"></A>he said-
<A NAME="338"></A><BR><BR>"If I fall, what mattereth that? my father hath seventy and eight 
<A NAME="339"></A>sons like unto me; but thou art alone, and if thy head shall fall, what 
<A NAME="340"></A>other is worthy of the crown?"
<A NAME="341"></A><BR><BR>And Kai Khosrau did as Gew desired. Then Gew gave combat unto Piran, 
<A NAME="342"></A>and by his courage he overcame the army; and he caught the old man Piran 
<A NAME="343"></A>in the meshes of his cord. Then he brought him bound before Ferangis and 
<A NAME="344"></A>Kai Khosrau her son.
<A NAME="345"></A><BR><BR>Now Piran, when he beheld Kai Khosrau, demanded not mercy at his 
<A NAME="346"></A>hands, but invoked the blessings of Heaven upon his head, and he mourned 
<A NAME="347"></A>the fate of Saiawush. And he said-
<A NAME="348"></A><BR><BR>"O King, had thy slave been nigh unto Afrasiyab, surely the head 
<A NAME="349"></A>of thy father would not have fallen at his hands. And it was I who preserved 
<A NAME="350"></A>thee and Ferangis thy mother, yet now is it given unto me to fall under 
<A NAME="351"></A>thy hands."
<A NAME="352"></A><BR><BR>When Kai Khosrau heard these words his heart went out unto Piran, 
<A NAME="353"></A>and when he looked towards his mother he saw that her eyes were filled 
<A NAME="354"></A>with tears. Then she opened her mouth and poured forth curses upon Afrasiyab 
<A NAME="355"></A>her father, and she wailed the fate of Saiawush, and she pleaded for the 
<A NAME="356"></A>life of this good old man. For she said-
<A NAME="357"></A><BR><BR>"His tenderness hath been an asylum unto our sorrow, and now is 
<A NAME="358"></A>it given unto us to remember the benefits we have received at his 
<A NAME="359"></A>hands."
<A NAME="360"></A><BR><BR>But Gew, when he heard it, said-
<A NAME="361"></A><BR>"O Queen, I pray thee speak not thus, for I have sworn a great oath 
<A NAME="362"></A>that I would stain the earth with the blood of Piran, and how can I depart 
<A NAME="363"></A>from my vow?"
<A NAME="364"></A><BR><BR>Then Kai Khosrau said, "O hero like unto a lion, thou shalt not 
<A NAME="365"></A>break the oath that thou hast made before God. Satisfy thy heart and accomplish 
<A NAME="366"></A>thy vow. Pierce with thy dagger the ear of Piran, and let his blood fall 
<A NAME="367"></A>on the earth, that thy vengeance and my clemency may both be 
<A NAME="368"></A>satisfied."
<A NAME="369"></A><BR><BR>Then Gew did as Kai Khosrau bade, and when he had crimsoned the 
<A NAME="370"></A>earth with the blood of Piran, they mounted him upon a charger fleet of 
<A NAME="371"></A>foot and bound him thereon, and caused him to swear unto them that none 
<A NAME="372"></A>other but Gulshehr his wife should release him from these bonds. And Piran 
<A NAME="373"></A>sware it and went forth, and his mouth poured blessings upon Kai 
<A NAME="374"></A>Khosrau.
<A NAME="375"></A><BR><BR>Now while these things were passing Afrasiyab grew impatient, and 
<A NAME="376"></A>set forth himself at the head of a great army that he might learn tidings 
<A NAME="377"></A>of Kai Khosrau. And when he heard that the armies had been beaten at the 
<A NAME="378"></A>hand of one man, his cheeks grew pale with fear; but when he met Piran 
<A NAME="379"></A>his Pehliva tied upon his charger, his anger knew no bounds, so that he 
<A NAME="380"></A>cried aloud, and commanded Piran that he depart from out his presence. 
<A NAME="381"></A>Then he sware that he would himself destroy this Gew, and lay low the head 
<A NAME="382"></A>of Kai Khosrau and of his mother. And he made great haste after them, and 
<A NAME="383"></A>he urged upon his men that they must find Kai Khosrau before he should 
<A NAME="384"></A>have crossed the Jihun and have entered upon the land of Iran; yet before 
<A NAME="385"></A>ever he was come nigh to them, the three were come unto its 
<A NAME="386"></A>banks.
<A NAME="387"></A><BR><BR>Now, a boat was lying ready, and a boatman slumbered beside it; 
<A NAME="388"></A>and Gew roused him, and said that he should bear them across the river. 
<A NAME="389"></A>But the man was greedy of gain, and beheld that Gew was in haste. So he 
<A NAME="390"></A>said-
<A NAME="391"></A><BR><BR>"Why should I carry thee across? Yet, if thou desire it, I demand 
<A NAME="392"></A>that thou give unto me one of four things: thy coat of mail, or thy black 
<A NAME="393"></A>horse, yon woman, or the crown of gold worn by this young 
<A NAME="394"></A>man."
<A NAME="395"></A><BR><BR>Then Gew was angry, and said-
<A NAME="396"></A><BR>"Thou speakest like a fool; thou knowest not what thou dost 
<A NAME="397"></A>ask."
<A NAME="398"></A><BR>Then he turned unto Kai Khosrau, and said-
<A NAME="399"></A><BR>"If thou be Kai Khosrau indeed, thou wilt not fear to enter this river 
<A NAME="400"></A>and cross it, even as it was crossed by Feridoun thy 
<A NAME="401"></A>sire."
<A NAME="402"></A><BR><BR>Now the river was swollen with the rains, but the young King regarded 
<A NAME="403"></A>it not. He entered upon its surge with Behzah his steed, and the horse 
<A NAME="404"></A>of his father bare him across the boiling waters. And Ferangis followed 
<A NAME="405"></A>after him and Gew the bold. And when Kai Khosrau was come unto the other 
<A NAME="406"></A>side, he dismounted and knelt and kissed the ground of Iran, and gave thanks 
<A NAME="407"></A>unto God the mighty.
<A NAME="408"></A><BR><BR>Yet scarce were they come to the other side than Afrasiyab came 
<A NAME="409"></A>up with his army. And Afrasiyab demanded of the boatman wherefore he had 
<A NAME="410"></A>borne them across, and when the man told him how it was come to pass, the 
<A NAME="411"></A>King was bowed down with anguish, for he knew now that that which was written 
<A NAME="412"></A>would be accomplished. So he returned him right sorrowful unto his 
<A NAME="413"></A>house.
<A NAME="414"></A><BR><BR>Now when Kai Khosrau came nigh unto the courts of the Shah, Gew 
<A NAME="415"></A>sent a writing unto Kai Kaous and told him all that was come to pass. And 
<A NAME="416"></A>Kai Kaous sent forth riders to lead before him his son; and the city was 
<A NAME="417"></A>decked to give him welcome, and all the nobles received him joyfully, and 
<A NAME="418"></A>Kai Kaous was glad at the sight of him, and all men regarded Kai Khosrau 
<A NAME="419"></A>as the heir, and only Tus was sorrowful at that which was come to pass. 
<A NAME="420"></A>But Tus was angered, and said that he would pay homage only unto Friburz, 
<A NAME="421"></A>and to none other. And he came before Kai Kaous and 
<A NAME="422"></A>said-
<A NAME="423"></A><BR><BR>"Friburz is thy son also, why therefore wilt thou give the crown 
<A NAME="424"></A>unto one who is sprung from the race of Afrasiyab?
<A NAME="425"></A><BR><BR>Then Gew said, "It is fitting that the son of Saiawush should succeed 
<A NAME="426"></A>unto the throne."
<A NAME="427"></A><BR><BR>But Tus listened not, and refused allegiance unto Kai Khosrau, 
<A NAME="428"></A>and there was strife among the nobles of Iran.
<A NAME="429"></A><BR><BR>Then one came before Kai Kaous and begged of him that he would 
<A NAME="430"></A>declare himself, for he said-
<A NAME="431"></A><BR><BR>"If we are divided among ourselves we shall fall a prey into the 
<A NAME="432"></A>hands of Afrasiyab. Let the Shah, therefore, bind up this 
<A NAME="433"></A>quarrel."
<A NAME="434"></A><BR><BR>Then Kai Kaous said, "Ye ask of me that which is hard, for both 
<A NAME="435"></A>my sons are dear unto me, and how should I choose between them? Yet I will 
<A NAME="436"></A>bethink me of a means to quiet this dissension. Let Kai Khosrau and Friburz 
<A NAME="437"></A>go forth unto Bahman, the fortress that is upon my borders which no man 
<A NAME="438"></A>hath conquered, for it is an abode of Deevs, and fire issueth thence continually. 
<A NAME="439"></A>And let them take with them an army, and I will bestow my crown and my 
<A NAME="440"></A>treasures upon him at whose hands the castle shall be 
<A NAME="441"></A>subdued."
<A NAME="442"></A><BR><BR>So Friburz and Kai Khosrau set forth, and Kai Khosrau suffered 
<A NAME="443"></A>that his elder take the lead. But in vain did Friburz strive against the 
<A NAME="444"></A>Deevs that were hidden behind the walls, and when seven days had passed 
<A NAME="445"></A>he returned discomfited from his emprise. Then Kai Khosrau set forth, and 
<A NAME="446"></A>he wrote a letter, amber-perfumed, and in it he desired the evil Deevs 
<A NAME="447"></A>that they give place unto him in the name of Ormuzd. And he affixed the 
<A NAME="448"></A>letter unto the point of his lance, and when he was come nigh unto the 
<A NAME="449"></A>burning fort he flung it beyond the walls. Then a great noise rent the 
<A NAME="450"></A>air like thunder, and the world became darkened, and when the light returned 
<A NAME="451"></A>unto the sky the castle was vanished from off the face of the 
<A NAME="452"></A>earth.
<A NAME="453"></A><BR><BR>Now when Kai Kaous heard it, he knew that the son of Saiawush was 
<A NAME="454"></A>learned in the arts of magic, as was fitting unto a king; and he beheld 
<A NAME="455"></A>also that he was wise and brave. And because that he was weary he surrendered 
<A NAME="456"></A>the throne unto him, and Kai Khosrau wore the crown of the Kaianides in 
<A NAME="457"></A>his stead.
