<A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A>Seistan, which is to the south of Iran, was ruled by Saum, the Pehliva, 
<A NAME="11"></A>girt with might and glory, and, but for the grief that he was childless, 
<A NAME="12"></A>his days were happy. Then it came to pass that a son was born unto him, 
<A NAME="13"></A>beautiful of face and limb, who had neither fault nor blemish save that 
<A NAME="14"></A>his hair was like unto that of an aged man. Now the women were afraid to 
<A NAME="15"></A>tell Saum, lest he be wroth when he should learn that his child was thus 
<A NAME="16"></A>set apart from his fellow-men. So the infant had gazed upon the light eight 
<A NAME="17"></A>days ere he knew thereof. Then a woman, brave above the rest, ventured 
<A NAME="18"></A>into his presence. She bowed herself unto the dust and craved of Saum the 
<A NAME="19"></A>boon of speech. And he suffered her, and she spake, 
<A NAME="20"></A>saying-
<A NAME="21"></A><BR><BR>"May the Lord keep and guard thee. May thine enemies be utterly 
<A NAME="22"></A>destroyed. May the days of Saum the hero be happy. For the Almighty hath 
<A NAME="23"></A>accomplished his desire. He hath given to him an heir, a son is born unto 
<A NAME="24"></A>the mighty warrior behind the curtains of his house, a moon-faced boy, 
<A NAME="25"></A>beautiful of face and limb, in whom there is neither fault nor blemish, 
<A NAME="26"></A>save that his hair is like unto that of an aged man. I beseech thee, O 
<A NAME="27"></A>my master, bethink thee that this gift is from God, nor give place in thine 
<A NAME="28"></A>heart to ingratitude."
<A NAME="29"></A><BR><BR>When Saum had listened to her words he arose and went unto the 
<A NAME="30"></A>house of the women. And he beheld the babe that was beautiful of face and 
<A NAME="31"></A>limb, but whose head was like unto that of an aged man. Then Saum, fearing 
<A NAME="32"></A>the jeers of his enemies, quitted the paths of wisdom. He lifted his head 
<A NAME="33"></A>unto heaven and murmured against the Lord of Destiny, and cried, 
<A NAME="34"></A>saying-
<A NAME="35"></A><BR><BR>"O thou eternally just and good, O source of happiness, incline 
<A NAME="36"></A>thine ear unto me and listen to my voice. If I have sinned, if I have strayed 
<A NAME="37"></A>in the paths of Ahriman, behold my repentance and pardon me. My soul is 
<A NAME="38"></A>ashamed, my heart is angered for reason of this child, for will not the 
<A NAME="39"></A>nobles say this boy presageth evil? They will hold me up to shame, and 
<A NAME="40"></A>what can I reply to their questions? It behoveth me to remove this stain, 
<A NAME="41"></A>that the land of Iran be not accursed."
<A NAME="42"></A><BR><BR>Thus spake Saum in his anger, railing against fate, and he commanded 
<A NAME="43"></A>his servants to take the child and cast it forth out of the 
<A NAME="44"></A>land.
<A NAME="45"></A><BR><BR>Now there standeth far from the haunts of men the Mount Alberz, 
<A NAME="46"></A>whose head toucheth the stars, and never had mortal foot been planted upon 
<A NAME="47"></A>its crest. And upon it had the Simurgh, the bird of marvel, builded her 
<A NAME="48"></A>nest. Of ebony and of sandal-wood did she build it, and twined it with 
<A NAME="49"></A>aloes, so that it was like unto a king's house, and the evil sway of Saturn 
<A NAME="50"></A>could not reach thereto. And at the foot of this mount was laid the child 
<A NAME="51"></A>of Saum. Then the Simurgh, when she spied the infant lying upon the ground, 
<A NAME="52"></A>bereft of clothes and wherewithal to nourish it, sucking its fingers for 
<A NAME="53"></A>very hunger, darted to earth and raised him in her talons. And she bare 
<A NAME="54"></A>him unto her nest, that her young might devour him. But when she had brought 
<A NAME="55"></A>him her heart was stirred within her for compassion. Therefore she bade 
<A NAME="56"></A>her young ones spare the babe and treat him like to a brother. Then she 
<A NAME="57"></A>chose out tender flesh to feed her guest, and tended the infant forsaken 
<A NAME="58"></A>of his sire. And thus did the Simurgh, nor ever wearied till that moons 
<A NAME="59"></A>and years had rolled above their heads, and the babe was grown to be a 
<A NAME="60"></A>youth full of strength and beauty. And his renown filled the land, for 
<A NAME="61"></A>neither good nor evil can be hidden for ever. And his fame spread even 
<A NAME="62"></A>unto the ears of Saum, the son of Neriman.
<A NAME="63"></A><BR><BR>Then it came to pass that Saum dreamed a dream, wherein he beheld 
<A NAME="64"></A>a man riding towards him mounted upon an Arab steed. And the man gave him 
<A NAME="65"></A>tidings of his son, and taunted him, saying-
<A NAME="66"></A><BR><BR>"O thou who hast offended against every duty, who disownest thy 
<A NAME="67"></A>son because that his hair is white, though thine own resembleth the silver 
<A NAME="68"></A>poplar, and to whom a bird seemeth fit nurse for thine offspring, wilt 
<A NAME="69"></A>thou abjure all kinship with him for ever?"
<A NAME="70"></A><BR><BR>Now when Saum awoke he remembered his dream, and fear came upon 
<A NAME="71"></A>him for his sin. And he called unto him his Mubids, and questioned them 
<A NAME="72"></A>concerning the stripling of the Mount Alberz, and whether this could be 
<A NAME="73"></A>indeed his son, for surely frosts and heat must long since have destroyed 
<A NAME="74"></A>him. Then the Mubids answered and said-
<A NAME="75"></A><BR><BR>"Not so, thou most ungrateful unto God, thou more cruel than the 
<A NAME="76"></A>lion, the tiger, and the crocodile, for even savage beasts tend their young, 
<A NAME="77"></A>whilst thou didst reject thine own, because thou heldest the white hair 
<A NAME="78"></A>given unto him by his Creator for a reproach in the sight of men. O faint 
<A NAME="79"></A>of heart, arise and seek thy child, for surely one whom God hath blessed 
<A NAME="80"></A>can never perish. And turn thou unto him and pray that he forgive 
<A NAME="81"></A>thee."
<A NAME="82"></A><BR><BR>When Saum had heard these words he was contrite, and called about 
<A NAME="83"></A>him his army and set forth unto the mountains. And when they were come 
<A NAME="84"></A>unto the mount that is raised up to the Pleiades, Saum beheld the Simurgh 
<A NAME="85"></A>and the nest, and a stripling that was like unto himself walking around 
<A NAME="86"></A>it. And his desire to get unto him was great, but he strove in vain to 
<A NAME="87"></A>scale the crest. Then Saum called upon God in his humility. And God heard 
<A NAME="88"></A>him, and put it into the heart of the Simurgh to look down and behold the 
<A NAME="89"></A>warrior and the army that was with him. And when she had seen Saum she 
<A NAME="90"></A>knew wherefore the chief was come, and she spake and 
<A NAME="91"></A>said-
<A NAME="92"></A><BR><BR>"O thou who hast shared this nest, I have reared thee and been 
<A NAME="93"></A>to thee a mother, for thy father cast thee out; the hour is come to part 
<A NAME="94"></A>us, and I must give thee again unto thy people. For thy father is Saum 
<A NAME="95"></A>the hero, the Pehliva of the world, greatest among the great, and he is 
<A NAME="96"></A>come hither to seek his son, and splendour awaiteth thee beside 
<A NAME="97"></A>him."
<A NAME="98"></A><BR><BR>When the youth had heard her words his eyes were filled with tears 
<A NAME="99"></A>and his heart with sorrow, for he had never gazed upon men, though he had 
<A NAME="100"></A>learned their speech. And he said-
<A NAME="101"></A><BR><BR>"Art thou then weary of me, or am I no longer fit to be thy house-fellow? 
<A NAME="102"></A>See, thy nest is unto me a throne, thy sheltering wings a parent. To thee 
<A NAME="103"></A>I owe all that I am, for thou wast my friend in need."
<A NAME="104"></A><BR><BR>And the Simurgh answered him saying, "I do not send thee away for 
<A NAME="105"></A>enmity, O my son; nay, I would keep thee beside me for ever, but another 
<A NAME="106"></A>destiny is better for thee. When thou shalt have seen the throne and its 
<A NAME="107"></A>pomp my nest will sink in thine esteem. Go forth, therefore, my son, and 
<A NAME="108"></A>try thy fortune in the world. But that thou mayst remember thy nurse who 
<A NAME="109"></A>shielded thee, and reared thee amid her little ones, that thou mayst remain 
<A NAME="110"></A>under the shadow of her wings, bear with thee this feather from her breast. 
<A NAME="111"></A>And in the day of thy need cast it into the fire, and I will come like 
<A NAME="112"></A>unto a cloud and deliver thee from danger."
<A NAME="113"></A><BR><BR>Thus she spake, and raised him in her talons and bore him to the 
<A NAME="114"></A>spot where Saum was bowed to the dust in penitence. Now when Saum beheld 
<A NAME="115"></A>his son, whose body was like unto an elephant's for strength and beauty, 
<A NAME="116"></A>he bent low before the Simurgh and covered her with benison. And he cried 
<A NAME="117"></A>out and said-
<A NAME="118"></A><BR><BR>"O Shah of birds, O bird of God, who confoundest the wicked, mayst 
<A NAME="119"></A>thou be great for ever."
<A NAME="120"></A><BR><BR>But while he yet spake the Simurgh flew upwards, and the gaze of 
<A NAME="121"></A>Saum was fixed upon his son. And as he looked he saw that he was worthy 
<A NAME="122"></A>of the throne, and that there was neither fault nor blemish in him, save 
<A NAME="123"></A>only his silvery locks. Then his heart rejoiced within him, and he blessed 
<A NAME="124"></A>him, and entreated his forgiveness. And he said-
<A NAME="125"></A><BR><BR>"O my son, open thine heart unto the meanest of God's servants, 
<A NAME="126"></A>and I swear unto thee, in the presence of Him that made us, that never 
<A NAME="127"></A>again will I harden my heart towards thee, and that I will grant unto thee 
<A NAME="128"></A>all thy desires."
<A NAME="129"></A><BR><BR>Then he clothed him in rich robes and named him Zal, which being 
<A NAME="130"></A>interpreted meaneth the aged. And he showed him unto the army. And when 
<A NAME="131"></A>they had looked on the youth they saw that he was goodly of visage and 
<A NAME="132"></A>of limb, and they shouted for very joy. Then the host made them ready to 
<A NAME="133"></A>return unto Seistan. And the kettle-drummers rode at their head, mounted 
<A NAME="134"></A>upon mighty elephants whose feet raised a cloud of dust that rose unto 
<A NAME="135"></A>the sky. And the tabors were beat, and the trumpets brayed, and the cymbals 
<A NAME="136"></A>clashed, and sounds of rejoicing filled the land because that Saum had 
<A NAME="137"></A>found his son, and that Zal was a hero among men.
<A NAME="138"></A><BR><BR>Now the news spread even unto Minuchihr that Saum was returning 
<A NAME="139"></A>from the mountains with great pomp and joy. And when he had heard it he 
<A NAME="140"></A>bade Nuder go forth to meet the Pehliva and bid him bring Zal unto the 
<A NAME="141"></A>court. And when Saum heard the desires of his master he obeyed and came 
<A NAME="142"></A>within his gates. Then he beheld the Shah seated upon the throne of the 
<A NAME="143"></A>Kaianides, bearing his crown upon his head, and on his right hand sat Karun 
<A NAME="144"></A>the Pehliva, and he bade Saum be seated on his left. And the Shah commanded 
<A NAME="145"></A>Saum that he should speak. Then Saum unbosomed himself before the Shah 
<A NAME="146"></A>and spake concerning his son, neither did he hide his evil deed. And Minuchihr 
<A NAME="147"></A>commanded that Zal be brought before him. So the chamberlains brought him 
<A NAME="148"></A>into the presence of the King, and he was clad in robes of splendour, and 
<A NAME="149"></A>the King was amazed at his aspect. And he turned and said unto 
<A NAME="150"></A>Saum-
<A NAME="151"></A><BR><BR>"O Pehliva of the world, the Shah enjoineth you have a care of 
<A NAME="152"></A>this noble youth, and guard him for the land of Iran. And teach him forthwith 
<A NAME="153"></A>the arts of war, and the pleasures and customs of the banquet, for how 
<A NAME="154"></A>should one that hath been reared in a nest be familiar with our 
<A NAME="155"></A>ways?
<A NAME="156"></A><BR><BR>Then the Shah bade the Mubids cast Zal's horoscope, and they read 
<A NAME="157"></A>that he would be a brave and prudent knight. Now when he had heard this 
<A NAME="158"></A>the Pehliva was relieved of all his fears, and the Shah rejoiced and covered 
<A NAME="159"></A>Saum with gifts. Arab horses did he give unto him with golden saddles, 
<A NAME="160"></A>Indian swords in scabbards of gold, brocades of Roum, skins of beasts, 
<A NAME="161"></A>and carpets of Ind, and the rubies and pearls were past the numbering. 
<A NAME="162"></A>And slaves poured musk and amber before him. And Minuchihr also granted 
<A NAME="163"></A>to Saum a throne, and a crown and a girdle of gold, and he named him ruler 
<A NAME="164"></A>of all the lands that stretch from the Sea of China to that of Sind, from 
<A NAME="165"></A>Zaboulistan to the Caspian. Then he bade that the Pehliva's horse be led 
<A NAME="166"></A>forth, and sent him away from his presence. And Saum called down blessings 
<A NAME="167"></A>upon the Shah, and turned his face towards home. And his train followed 
<A NAME="168"></A>after him, and the sound of music went before them.
<A NAME="169"></A><BR><BR>Then when the tidings came to Seistan that the great hero was drawing 
<A NAME="170"></A>nigh, the city decked itself in festive garbs, and every man called down 
<A NAME="171"></A>the blessings of Heaven upon Zal, the son of Saum, and poured gifts at 
<A NAME="172"></A>his feet. And there was joy in all the land for that Saum had taken back 
<A NAME="173"></A>his son.
<A NAME="174"></A><BR><BR>Now Saum forthwith called about him his Mubids, and bade them instruct 
<A NAME="175"></A>the youth in all the virtues of a king.
<A NAME="176"></A><BR><BR>And daily Zal increased in wisdom and strength, and his fame filled 
<A NAME="177"></A>the land. And when Saum went forth to fight the battles of the Shah, he 
<A NAME="178"></A>left the kingdom under his hands, and Zal administered it with judgment 
<A NAME="179"></A>and virtue.
