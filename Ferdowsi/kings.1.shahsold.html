<A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A>Kaiumers first sat upon the throne of Persia, and was master of the world. 
<A NAME="11"></A>He took up his abode in the mountains, and clad himself and his people 
<A NAME="12"></A>in tiger-skins, and from him sprang all kindly nurture and the arts of 
<A NAME="13"></A>clothing, till then unknown. Men and beasts from all parts of the earth 
<A NAME="14"></A>came to do him homage and receive laws at his hands, and his glory was 
<A NAME="15"></A>like to the sun. Then Ahriman the Evil, when he saw how the Shah's honour 
<A NAME="16"></A>was increased, waxed envious, and sought to usurp the diadem of the world. 
<A NAME="17"></A>So he bade his son, a mighty Deev, gather together an army to go out against 
<A NAME="18"></A>Kaiumers and his beloved son Saiamuk and destroy them 
<A NAME="19"></A>utterly.
<A NAME="20"></A><BR><BR>Now the Serosch, the angel who defendeth men from the snares of 
<A NAME="21"></A>the Deevs, and who each night flieth seven times around the earth that 
<A NAME="22"></A>he may watch over the children of Ormuzd, when he learned this, appeared 
<A NAME="23"></A>like unto a Peri and warned Kaiumers. So when Saiamuk set forth at the 
<A NAME="24"></A>head of his warriors to meet the army of Ahriman, he knew that he was contending 
<A NAME="25"></A>against a Deev, and he put forth all his strength. But the Deev was mightier 
<A NAME="26"></A>than he, and overcame him, and crushed him under his 
<A NAME="27"></A>hands.
<A NAME="28"></A><BR><BR>When Kaiumers heard the news of mourning, he was bowed to the ground. 
<A NAME="29"></A>For a year did he weep without ceasing, and his army wept with him; yea, 
<A NAME="30"></A>even the savage beasts and the birds of the air joined in the wailing. 
<A NAME="31"></A>And sorrow reigned in the land, and all the world was darkened until the 
<A NAME="32"></A>Serosch bade the Shah lift his head and think on vengeance. And Kaiumers 
<A NAME="33"></A>obeyed, and commanded Husheng, the son of Saiamuk, "Take the lead of the 
<A NAME="34"></A>army, and march against the Deevs." And the King, by reason of his great 
<A NAME="35"></A>age, went in the rear. Now there were in the host Peris; also tigers, lions, 
<A NAME="36"></A>wolves, and other fierce creatures, and when the black Deev heard their 
<A NAME="37"></A>roaring he trembled for very fear. Neither could he hold himself against 
<A NAME="38"></A>them, and Husheng routed him utterly. Then when Kaiumers saw that his well-beloved 
<A NAME="39"></A>son was revenged he laid him down to die, and the world was void of him, 
<A NAME="40"></A>and Husheng reigned in his stead.
<A NAME="41"></A><BR><BR>Now Husheng was a wise man and just, and the heavens revolved over 
<A NAME="42"></A>his throne forty years. Justice did he spread over the land, and the world 
<A NAME="43"></A>was better for his reign. For he first gave to men fire, and showed them 
<A NAME="44"></A>how to draw it from out the stone; and he taught them how they might lead 
<A NAME="45"></A>the rivers, that they should water the land and make it fertile; and he 
<A NAME="46"></A>bade them till and reap. And he divided the beasts and paired them and 
<A NAME="47"></A>gave them names. And when he passed to a brighter life he left the world 
<A NAME="48"></A>empty of a throne of power. But Tahumers, his son, was not unworthy of 
<A NAME="49"></A>his sire. He too opened the eyes of men, and they learned to spin and to 
<A NAME="50"></A>weave; and he reigned over the land long and mightily. But of him also 
<A NAME="51"></A>were the Deevs right envious, and sought to destroy him. Yet Tahumers overcame 
<A NAME="52"></A>them and cast them to earth. Then some craved mercy at his hands, and sware 
<A NAME="53"></A>how they would show him an art if he would spare them, and Tahumers listened 
<A NAME="54"></A>to their voice. And they taught him the art of writing, and thus from the 
<A NAME="55"></A>evil Deevs came a boon upon mankind.
<A NAME="56"></A><BR><BR>Howbeit when Tahumers had sat upon the golden throne for the space 
<A NAME="57"></A>of thirty years he passed away, but his works endured; and Jemshid, his 
<A NAME="58"></A>glorious son, whose heart was filled with the counsels of his father, came 
<A NAME="59"></A>after him. Now Jemshid reigned over the land seven hundred years girt with 
<A NAME="60"></A>might, and Deevs, birds, and Peris obeyed him. And the world was happier 
<A NAME="61"></A>for his sake, and he too was glad, and death was unknown among men, neither 
<A NAME="62"></A>did they wot of pain or sorrow. And he first parcelled out men into classes; 
<A NAME="63"></A>priests, warriors, artificers, and husbandmen did he name them. And the 
<A NAME="64"></A>year also he divided into periods. And by aid of the Deevs he raised mighty 
<A NAME="65"></A>works, and Persepolis was builded by him, that to this day is called Tukht-e-Jemsheed, 
<A NAME="66"></A>which being interpreted meaneth the throne of Jemshid. Then, when these 
<A NAME="67"></A>things were accomplished, men flocked from all corners of the earth around 
<A NAME="68"></A>his throne to do him homage and pour gifts before his face. And Jemshid 
<A NAME="69"></A>prepared a feast, and bade them keep it, and called it Neurouz, which is 
<A NAME="70"></A>the New Day, and the people of Persia keep it to this hour. And Jemshid's 
<A NAME="71"></A>power increased, and the world was at peace, and men beheld in him nought 
<A NAME="72"></A>but what was good.
<A NAME="73"></A><BR><BR>Then it came about that the heart of Jemshid was uplifted in pride, 
<A NAME="74"></A>and he forgot whence came his weal and the source of his blessings. He 
<A NAME="75"></A>beheld only himself upon the earth, and he named himself God, and sent 
<A NAME="76"></A>forth his image to be worshipped. But when he had spoken thus, the Mubids, 
<A NAME="77"></A>which are astrologers and wise men, hung their heads in sorrow, and no 
<A NAME="78"></A>man knew how he should answer the Shah. And God withdrew his hand from 
<A NAME="79"></A>Jemshid, and the kings and the nobles rose up against him, and removed 
<A NAME="80"></A>their warriors from his court, and Ahriman had power over the 
<A NAME="81"></A>land.
<A NAME="82"></A><BR><BR>Now there dwelt in the deserts of Arabia a king named Mirtas, generous 
<A NAME="83"></A>and just, and he had a son, Zohak, whom he loved. And it came about that 
<A NAME="84"></A>Ahriman visited the palace disguised as a noble, and tempted Zohak that 
<A NAME="85"></A>he should depart from the paths of virtue. And he spake unto him and 
<A NAME="86"></A>said-
<A NAME="87"></A><BR><BR>"If thou wilt listen to me, and enter into a covenant, I will raise 
<A NAME="88"></A>thy head above the sun."
<A NAME="89"></A><BR><BR>Now the young man was guileless and simple of heart, and he sware 
<A NAME="90"></A>unto the Deev that he would obey him in all things. Then Ahriman bade him 
<A NAME="91"></A>slay his father, "for this old man," he said, "cumbereth the ground, and 
<A NAME="92"></A>while he liveth thou wilt remain unknown." When Zohak heard this he was 
<A NAME="93"></A>filled with grief, and would have broken his oath, but Ahriman suffered 
<A NAME="94"></A>him not, but made him set a trap for Mirtas. And Zohak and the evil Ahriman 
<A NAME="95"></A>held their peace and Mirtas fell into the snare and was killed. Then Zohak 
<A NAME="96"></A>placed the crown of Thasis upon his head, and Ahriman taught him the arts 
<A NAME="97"></A>of magic, and he ruled over his people in good and evil, for he was not 
<A NAME="98"></A>yet wholly given up to guile.
<A NAME="99"></A><BR><BR>Then Ahriman imagined a device in his black heart. He took upon 
<A NAME="100"></A>himself the form of a youth, and craved that he might serve the King as 
<A NAME="101"></A>cook. And Zohak, who knew him not, received him well and granted his request, 
<A NAME="102"></A>and the keys of the kitchen were given unto him. Now hitherto men had been 
<A NAME="103"></A>nourished with herbs, but Ahriman prepared flesh for Zohak. New dishes 
<A NAME="104"></A>did he put before him, and the royal favour was accorded to his savory 
<A NAME="105"></A>meats. And the flesh gave the King courage and strength like to that of 
<A NAME="106"></A>a lion, and he commanded that his cook should be brought before him and 
<A NAME="107"></A>ask a boon at his hands. And the cook said-
<A NAME="108"></A><BR><BR>"If the King take pleasure in his servant, grant that he may kiss 
<A NAME="109"></A>his shoulders."
<A NAME="110"></A><BR><BR>Now Zohak, who feared no evil, granted the request, and Ahriman 
<A NAME="111"></A>kissed him on his shoulders. And when he had done so, the ground opened 
<A NAME="112"></A>beneath his feet and covered the cook, so that all men present were amazed 
<A NAME="113"></A>thereat. But from his kiss sprang hissing serpents, venomous and black; 
<A NAME="114"></A>and the King was afraid, and desired that they should be cut off from the 
<A NAME="115"></A>root. But as often as the snakes were cut down did they grow again, and 
<A NAME="116"></A>in vain the wise men and physicians cast about for a remedy. Then Ahriman 
<A NAME="117"></A>came once again disguised as a learned man, and was led before Zohak, and 
<A NAME="118"></A>he spake, saying-
<A NAME="119"></A><BR><BR>"This ill cannot be healed, neither can the serpents be uprooted. 
<A NAME="120"></A>Prepare food for them, therefore, that they may be fed, and give unto them 
<A NAME="121"></A>for nourishment the brains of men, for perchance this may destroy 
<A NAME="122"></A>them."
<A NAME="123"></A><BR><BR>But in his secret heart Ahriman desired that the world might thus 
<A NAME="124"></A>be made desolate; and daily were the serpents fed, and the fear of the 
<A NAME="125"></A>King was great in the land. The world withered in his thrall, the customs 
<A NAME="126"></A>of good men were forgotten, and the desires of the wicked were 
<A NAME="127"></A>accomplished.
<A NAME="128"></A><BR><BR>Now it was spread abroad in Iran that in the land of Thasis there 
<A NAME="129"></A>reigned a man who was mighty and terrible to his foes. Then the kings and 
<A NAME="130"></A>nobles who had withdrawn from Jemshid because he had rebelled against God, 
<A NAME="131"></A>turned to Zohak and besought him that he would be their ruler, and they 
<A NAME="132"></A>proclaimed him Shah. And the armies of Arabia and Persia marched against 
<A NAME="133"></A>Jemshid, and he fled before their face. For the space of twice fifty years 
<A NAME="134"></A>no man knew whither he was gone, for he hid from the wrath of the Serpent-King. 
<A NAME="135"></A>But in the fulness of time he could no longer escape the fury of Zohak, 
<A NAME="136"></A>whose servants found him as he wandered on the sea-shore of Cathay, and 
<A NAME="137"></A>they sawed him in twain, and sent tidings thereof to their lord. And thus 
<A NAME="138"></A>perished the throne and power of Jemshid like unto the grass that withereth, 
<A NAME="139"></A>because that he was grown proud, and would have lifted himself above his 
<A NAME="140"></A>Maker.
<A NAME="141"></A><BR><BR>So the beloved of Ahriman, Zohak the Serpent, sat upon the throne 
<A NAME="142"></A>of Iran, the kingdom of Light. And he continued to pile evil upon evil 
<A NAME="143"></A>till the measure thereof was full to overflowing, and all the land cried 
<A NAME="144"></A>out against him. But Zohak and his councillors, the Deevs, shut ear unto 
<A NAME="145"></A>this cry, and the Shah reigned thus for the space of a thousand years, 
<A NAME="146"></A>and vice stalked in daylight, but virtue was hidden. And despair filled 
<A NAME="147"></A>all hearts, for it was as though mankind must perish to still the appetite 
<A NAME="148"></A>of those snakes sprung from Evil, for daily were two men slaughtered to 
<A NAME="149"></A>satisfy their desire. Neither had Zohak mercy upon any man. And darkness 
<A NAME="150"></A>was spread over the land because of his wickedness.
<A NAME="151"></A><BR><BR>But Ormuzd saw it and was moved with compassion for his people, 
<A NAME="152"></A>and he declared they should no longer suffer for the sin of Jemshid. And 
<A NAME="153"></A>he caused a grandson to be born to Jemshid, and his parents called him 
<A NAME="154"></A>Feridoun.
<A NAME="155"></A><BR><BR>Now it befell that when he was born, Zohak dreamed he beheld a 
<A NAME="156"></A>youth slender like to a cypress, and he came towards him bearing a cow-headed 
<A NAME="157"></A>mace, and with it he struck Zohak to the ground. Then the tyrant awoke 
<A NAME="158"></A>and trembled, and called for his Mubids, that they should interpret to 
<A NAME="159"></A>him this dream. And they were troubled, for they foresaw danger, and he 
<A NAME="160"></A>menaced them if they foretold him evil. And they were silent for fear three 
<A NAME="161"></A>days, but on the fourth one who had courage spake and 
<A NAME="162"></A>said-
<A NAME="163"></A><BR><BR>"There will arise one named Feridoun, who shall inherit thy throne 
<A NAME="164"></A>and reverse thy fortunes, and strike thee down with a cow-headed 
<A NAME="165"></A>mace."
<A NAME="166"></A><BR><BR>When Zohak heard these words he swooned, and the Mubids fled before 
<A NAME="167"></A>his wrath. But when he had recovered he bade the world be scoured for Feridoun. 
<A NAME="168"></A>And henceforth Zohak was consumed for bitterness of spirit, and he knew 
<A NAME="169"></A>neither rest nor joy.
<A NAME="170"></A><BR><BR>Now it came about that the mother of Feridoun feared lest the Shah 
<A NAME="171"></A>should destroy the child if he learned that he was sprung from Jemshid's 
<A NAME="172"></A>race. So she hid him in the thick forest where dwelt the wondrous cow Purmaieh, 
<A NAME="173"></A>whose hairs were like unto the plumes of a peacock for beauty. And she 
<A NAME="174"></A>prayed the guardian of Purmaieh to have a care of her son, and for three 
<A NAME="175"></A>years he was reared in the wood, and Purmaieh was his nurse. But when the 
<A NAME="176"></A>time was accomplished the mother knew that news of Purmaieh had reached 
<A NAME="177"></A>the ears of Zohak, and she feared he would find her son. Therefore she 
<A NAME="178"></A>took him far into Ind, to a pious hermit who dwelt on the Mount Alberz. 
<A NAME="179"></A>And she prayed the hermit to guard her boy, who was destined for mighty 
<A NAME="180"></A>deeds. And the hermit granted her request. And it befell that while she 
<A NAME="181"></A>sojourned with him Zohak had found the beauteous Purmaieh and learned of 
<A NAME="182"></A>Feridoun, and when he heard that the boy was fled he was like unto a mad 
<A NAME="183"></A>elephant in his fury. He slew the wondrous cow and all the living things 
<A NAME="184"></A>round about, and made the forest a desert. Then he continued his search, 
<A NAME="185"></A>but neither tidings nor sight could he get of Feridoun, and his heart was 
<A NAME="186"></A>filled with anguish.
<A NAME="187"></A><BR><BR>In this year Zohak caused his army to be strengthened, and he demanded 
<A NAME="188"></A>of his people that they should certify that he had ever been to them a 
<A NAME="189"></A>just and noble king. And they obeyed for very fear. But while they sware 
<A NAME="190"></A>there arose without the doorway of the Shah the cry of one who demanded 
<A NAME="191"></A>justice. And Zohak commanded that he should be brought in, and the man 
<A NAME="192"></A>stood before the assembly of the nobles.
<A NAME="193"></A><BR><BR>Then Zohak opened his mouth and said, "I charge thee give a name 
<A NAME="194"></A>unto him who hath done thee wrong."
<A NAME="195"></A><BR><BR>And the man, when he saw it was the Shah who questioned him, smote 
<A NAME="196"></A>his head with his hands. But he answered and said-
<A NAME="197"></A><BR><BR>"I am Kawah, a blacksmith and a blameless man, and I sue for justice, 
<A NAME="198"></A>and it is against thee, O King, that I cry out. Seventeen fair sons have 
<A NAME="199"></A>I called mine, yet only one remaineth to me, for that his brethren were 
<A NAME="200"></A>slain to still the hunger of thy serpents, and now they have taken from 
<A NAME="201"></A>me this last child also. I pray thee spare him unto me, nor heap thy cruelties 
<A NAME="202"></A>upon the land past bearing."
<A NAME="203"></A><BR><BR>And the Shah feared Kawah's wrath, beholding that it was great, 
<A NAME="204"></A>and he granted him the life of his son and sought to win him with soft 
<A NAME="205"></A>words. Then he prayed him that he would also sign the testimony that Zohak 
<A NAME="206"></A>was a just and noble king.
<A NAME="207"></A><BR><BR>But Kawah cried, "Not so, thou wicked and ignoble man, ally of 
<A NAME="208"></A>Deevs, I will not lend my hand unto this lie," and he seized the declaration 
<A NAME="209"></A>and tore it into fragments and scattered them into the air. And when he 
<A NAME="210"></A>had done so he strode forth from the palace, and all the nobles and people 
<A NAME="211"></A>were astonished, so that none dared uplift a finger to restrain him. Then 
<A NAME="212"></A>Kawah went to the market-place and related to the people all that which 
<A NAME="213"></A>he had seen, and recalled to them the evil deeds of Zohak and the wrongs 
<A NAME="214"></A>they had suffered at his hands. And he provoked them to shake off the yoke 
<A NAME="215"></A>of Ahriman. And taking off the leathern apron wherewith blacksmiths cover 
<A NAME="216"></A>their knees when they strike with the hammer, he raised it aloft upon the 
<A NAME="217"></A>point of a lance and cried-
<A NAME="218"></A><BR><BR>"Be this our banner to march forth and seek out Feridoun and entreat 
<A NAME="219"></A>him that he deliver us from out the hands of the Serpent-King."
<A NAME="220"></A><BR><BR>Then the people set up a shout of joy and gathered themselves round 
<A NAME="221"></A>Kawah, and he led them out of the city bearing aloft his standard. And 
<A NAME="222"></A>they marched thus for many days unto the palace of Feridoun.
<A NAME="223"></A><BR><BR>Now these things came about in the land of Iran after twice eight 
<A NAME="224"></A>years were passed over the head of Feridoun. And when that time was accomplished, 
<A NAME="225"></A>he descended from the Mount Alberz and sought out his mother, questioning 
<A NAME="226"></A>her of his lineage. And she told him how that he was sprung from the race 
<A NAME="227"></A>of Jemshid, and also of Zohak and of his evil deeds.
<A NAME="228"></A><BR><BR>Then said Feridoun, "I will uproot this monster from the earth, 
<A NAME="229"></A>and his palace will I raze to the dust."
<A NAME="230"></A><BR><BR>But his mother spake, and said, "Not so, my son, let not thine 
<A NAME="231"></A>youthful anger betray thee; for how canst thou stand against all the 
<A NAME="232"></A>world?"
<A NAME="233"></A><BR><BR>Yet not long did she suffer the hard task to hinder him, for soon 
<A NAME="234"></A>a mighty crowd came towards the palace led by one who bare an apron uplifted 
<A NAME="235"></A>upon a lance. Then Feridoun knew that succour was come unto him. And when 
<A NAME="236"></A>he had listened to Kawah, he came into the presence of his mother with 
<A NAME="237"></A>the helmet of kings upon his head, and he said unto 
<A NAME="238"></A>her-
<A NAME="239"></A><BR><BR>"Mother, I go to the wars, and it remaineth for thee to pray God 
<A NAME="240"></A>for my safety."
<A NAME="241"></A><BR><BR>Then he caused a mighty club to be made for him, and he traced 
<A NAME="242"></A>the pattern thereof upon the ground, and the top thereof was the head of 
<A NAME="243"></A>a cow, in memory of Purmaieh, his nurse. Then he cased the standard of 
<A NAME="244"></A>Kawah in rich brocades of Roum, and hung jewels upon it. And when all was 
<A NAME="245"></A>made ready, they set forth towards the West to seek out Zohak, for, they 
<A NAME="246"></A>knew not that he was gone to Ind in search of Feridoun. Now when they were 
<A NAME="247"></A>come to Bagdad, which is upon the banks of the Tigris, they halted, and 
<A NAME="248"></A>Feridoun bade the guardians of the flood convey them across. But these 
<A NAME="249"></A>refused, saying, the King bade that none should pass save only those who 
<A NAME="250"></A>bore the royal seal. When Feridoun heard these words he was wroth, and 
<A NAME="251"></A>he regarded not the rushing river nor the dangers hidden within its floods. 
<A NAME="252"></A>He girded his loins and plunged with his steed into the waters, and all 
<A NAME="253"></A>the army followed after him. Now they struggled sore with the rushing stream, 
<A NAME="254"></A>and it seemed as though the waves would bear them down. But their brave 
<A NAME="255"></A>horses overcame all dangers, and they stepped in safety upon the shore. 
<A NAME="256"></A>Then they turned their faces towards the city which is now called Jerusalem, 
<A NAME="257"></A>for here stood the glorious house that Zohak had builded. And when they 
<A NAME="258"></A>had entered the city all the people rallied round Feridoun, for they hated 
<A NAME="259"></A>Zohak and looked to Feridoun to deliver them. And he slew the Deevs that 
<A NAME="260"></A>held the palace, and cast down the evil talisman that was graven upon the 
<A NAME="261"></A>walls. Then he mounted the throne of the idolater and placed the crown 
<A NAME="262"></A>of Iran upon his head, and all the people bowed down before him and called 
<A NAME="263"></A>him Shah.
<A NAME="264"></A><BR><BR>Now when Zohak returned from his search after Feridoun and learned 
<A NAME="265"></A>that he was seated upon his throne, he encompassed the city with his host. 
<A NAME="266"></A>But the army of Feridoun marched against him, and the desires of the people 
<A NAME="267"></A>went with them. And all that day bricks fell from the walls and stones 
<A NAME="268"></A>from the terraces, and it rained arrows and spears like to hail falling 
<A NAME="269"></A>from a dark cloud, until Feridoun had overcome the might of Zohak. Then 
<A NAME="270"></A>Feridoun raised his cow-headed mace to slay the Serpent-King. But the blessed 
<A NAME="271"></A>Serosch swooped down, and cried-
<A NAME="272"></A><BR><BR>"Not so, strike not, for Zohak's hour is not yet 
<A NAME="273"></A>come."
<A NAME="274"></A><BR>Then the Serosch bade the Shah bind the usurper and carry him far from 
<A NAME="275"></A>the haunts of men, and there fasten him to a rock. And Feridoun did as 
<A NAME="276"></A>he was bidden, and led forth Zohak to the Mount Demawend. And he bound 
<A NAME="277"></A>him to the rock with mighty chains and nails driven into his hands, and 
<A NAME="278"></A>left him to perish in agony. And the hot sun shone down upon the barren 
<A NAME="279"></A>cliffs, and there was neither tree nor shrub to shelter him, and the chains 
<A NAME="280"></A>entered into his flesh, and his tongue was consumed with thirst. Thus after 
<A NAME="281"></A>a while the earth was delivered of Zohak the evil one, and Feridoun reigned 
<A NAME="282"></A>in his stead.
