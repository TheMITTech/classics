<A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A>Now it came to pass as Kai Khosrau foretold. For Afrasiyab, when he learned 
<A NAME="11"></A>the death of Piran, was beside himself with grief. And he lifted up his 
<A NAME="12"></A>voice in wailing, and he spake, saying-
<A NAME="13"></A><BR><BR>"I will no longer taste the joys of life, nor live like unto a 
<A NAME="14"></A>man that weareth a crown, until I be avenged upon Kai Khosrau, the offspring 
<A NAME="15"></A>of an accursed race. May the seed of Saiawush perish from off the face 
<A NAME="16"></A>of the earth!
<A NAME="17"></A><BR><BR>"And when he had so spoken he made ready for yet another war, and 
<A NAME="18"></A>from all corners of the earth the kings came forth to aid him. And Kai 
<A NAME="19"></A>Khosrau, when he learned thereof, got ready his army also, and he sware 
<A NAME="20"></A>that he would lead this war of vengeance unto a good end. So he sent greeting 
<A NAME="21"></A>unto Rustem his Pehliva, and prayed of him that he would aid him in his 
<A NAME="22"></A>resolve. And Rustem listened to the voice of his Shah, and came forth from 
<A NAME="23"></A>Zaboulistan with a mighty army to aid him. Then the Shah confided his hosts 
<A NAME="24"></A>unto Tur and Rustem, and the valleys, and the hills, and the deserts, and 
<A NAME="25"></A>the plains were filled with the dust that uprose from their footsteps. 
<A NAME="26"></A>And they were warriors that bare high their heads, and they knew neither 
<A NAME="27"></A>weariness nor fear.
<A NAME="28"></A><BR><BR>Now when the armies met, Afrasiyab called before him Pescheng, 
<A NAME="29"></A>his son, and bade him bear a writing unto the Shah of Iran. And he wrote, 
<A NAME="30"></A>saying-
<A NAME="31"></A><BR><BR>"That which thou hast done, it is contrary to custom; for a son 
<A NAME="32"></A>may not lift his hand against his father, and the head of a grandson that 
<A NAME="33"></A>goeth out in enmity against his grandsire is filled with evil. And I say 
<A NAME="34"></A>unto thee, Saiawush was not slain without just cause, for he turned him 
<A NAME="35"></A>away from his ruler. And if thou sayest unto me that I am an evil man, 
<A NAME="36"></A>and issue of the race of Ahriman, remember that thou too art sprung from 
<A NAME="37"></A>my loins, and that thy insults fall back upon thyself. Renounce, therefore, 
<A NAME="38"></A>this strife, and let a treaty be made between us, and the blood of Saiawush 
<A NAME="39"></A>be forgotten. And if thou wilt listen unto my voice, I will cover thee 
<A NAME="40"></A>with jewels, and gold and precious things will I give unto thee, and joy 
<A NAME="41"></A>shall reign throughout the land."
<A NAME="42"></A><BR><BR>But Kai Khosrau, when he had read this message, knew that Afrasiyab 
<A NAME="43"></A>sought only to beguile him. So he sent a writing unto the King of Turan, 
<A NAME="44"></A>and he said-
<A NAME="45"></A><BR><BR>"The cause of strife between us is not sprung from Saiawush alone, 
<A NAME="46"></A>but for that which thou didst aforetime, and which thy fathers did unto 
<A NAME="47"></A>Irij. Yet that which thou hast done hath caused the measure of wrath to 
<A NAME="48"></A>overflow. Wherefore the sword alone can decide between 
<A NAME="49"></A>us."
<A NAME="50"></A><BR><BR>Then he challenged the nobles of Turan to come forth in combat. 
<A NAME="51"></A>And he himself strove with Schideh, the son of Afrasiyab, and he laid him 
<A NAME="52"></A>low after the manner in which Afrasiyab had laid low the head of Saiawush. 
<A NAME="53"></A>And when he had done so, the army of Turan came forth to avenge their king, 
<A NAME="54"></A>but the men of Iran overcame them. And Afrasiyab was constrained to fly 
<A NAME="55"></A>from before the face of Kai Khosrau, and it was as gall and wormwood unto 
<A NAME="56"></A>his spirit. And Kai Khosrau followed after him, and he would not suffer 
<A NAME="57"></A>him to hide himself from his sight; and he made him come forth yet again 
<A NAME="58"></A>in battle, and yet again he routed him utterly. And the men of Iran slew 
<A NAME="59"></A>the men of Turan until the field of battle was like unto a sea of blood, 
<A NAME="60"></A>and they fought until the night covered the heavens, and the eyes of the 
<A NAME="61"></A>warriors were darkened with sleep. And Afrasiyab fled yet again beyond 
<A NAME="62"></A>the borders of Turan, and he craved of his vassals that they would hide 
<A NAME="63"></A>him from the wrath of Kai Khosrau. But the nobles were afraid of the Shah, 
<A NAME="64"></A>and of Rustem, who went with him; and they refused shelter unto Afrasiyab, 
<A NAME="65"></A>and he was hunted over the face of the earth. Then he sought out the King 
<A NAME="66"></A>of China, and asked of him that he would shelter him. And the King gave 
<A NAME="67"></A>him shelter for a while. But when Kai Khosrau learned where Afrasiyab was 
<A NAME="68"></A>hid, he followed after him, and he bade the King of China render to him 
<A NAME="69"></A>his enemy, and he menaced him with fire and sword if he did not listen 
<A NAME="70"></A>to his behest. So the King bade Afrasiyab depart from out his borders. 
<A NAME="71"></A>And Afrasiyab fled yet again, but wheresoever he hid himself he was found 
<A NAME="72"></A>of Kai Khosrau, and his life was a weariness unto him.
<A NAME="73"></A><BR><BR>Now for the space of two years Kai Khosrau did thus unto Afrasiyab, 
<A NAME="74"></A>and the glory of Turan was eclipsed, and Rustem reigned within the land. 
<A NAME="75"></A>And when the second year was ended the power of Afrasiyab was broken, and 
<A NAME="76"></A>Kai Khosrau bethought him to return unto Iran and seek out Kai Kaous, his 
<A NAME="77"></A>sire. And the old Shah, when he learned it, was young again for joy. He 
<A NAME="78"></A>caused his house to be decked worthy a guest, and he made ready great feasts, 
<A NAME="79"></A>and he called forth all his nobles to do honour unto Kai Khosrau, his son. 
<A NAME="80"></A>And all the land was decked in festal garb, and the world resembled cloth 
<A NAME="81"></A>of gold, and musk and amber perfumed the air, and jewels were strewn about 
<A NAME="82"></A>the streets like unto vile dust.
<A NAME="83"></A><BR><BR>Now when the Shah came nigh unto the city, Kai Kaous went forth 
<A NAME="84"></A>to meet him, and he prostrated him in the dust before his son. But Kai 
<A NAME="85"></A>Khosrau suffered it not, but raised him, and he kissed him upon his cheeks, 
<A NAME="86"></A>and he took his hand, and he told unto him of all the wonders that he had 
<A NAME="87"></A>beheld upon his travels, and of the mighty deeds that had been done of 
<A NAME="88"></A>Rustem and his men. And Kai Kaous was filled with marvel at his grandson, 
<A NAME="89"></A>and he could not cease from praising him and pouring gifts before his face. 
<A NAME="90"></A>And when they had feasted the army, and were sated with speech, they went 
<A NAME="91"></A>in unto the temple of Ormuzd and gave thanks unto God for all His 
<A NAME="92"></A>blessings.
<A NAME="93"></A><BR><BR>Now while these things were passing in the land of Iran, Afrasiyab 
<A NAME="94"></A>wandered over the earth, and he knew neither rest nor nourishment. And 
<A NAME="95"></A>his soul was unquiet, and his body was weary, and he feared danger on all 
<A NAME="96"></A>sides. And he roamed till that he found a cavern in the side of a mountain, 
<A NAME="97"></A>and he crept into it for rest. And he remained a while within the cave 
<A NAME="98"></A>pondering his evil deeds, and his heart was filled with repentance. And 
<A NAME="99"></A>he prayed aloud unto God that He would grant him forgiveness of his sins, 
<A NAME="100"></A>and the cries of his sorrow rent the air.
<A NAME="101"></A><BR><BR>Now the sound thereof pierced even unto the ears of Houm, a hermit 
<A NAME="102"></A>of the race of Feridoun, who had taken up his abode in the mountains. And 
<A NAME="103"></A>Houm, when he heard the cries, said within himself, "These are lamentations 
<A NAME="104"></A>of Afrasiyab." So he sought out the spot whence they came forth, and when 
<A NAME="105"></A>he had found Afrasiyab he wrestled with him and caught him in his snare. 
<A NAME="106"></A>Then he bound him, and led him even into Iran before the face of Kai Khosrau, 
<A NAME="107"></A>that the Shah might deal with him according to his desire.
<A NAME="108"></A><BR><BR>Now when Afrasiyab was come before the Shah, Kai Khosrau reproached 
<A NAME="109"></A>him yet again with his vile deeds. And when he had done speaking, he lifted 
<A NAME="110"></A>up his sword and he smote with it the neck of Afrasiyab, and he severed 
<A NAME="111"></A>his head from off his trunk, even as Afrasiyab had done unto Saiawush, 
<A NAME="112"></A>his father. And thus was the throne of Turan made void of Afrasiyab, and 
<A NAME="113"></A>his evil deeds had in the end brought evil upon himself. And Gersiwaz, 
<A NAME="114"></A>whom the Shah had taken captive in the battle, was witness of the fate 
<A NAME="115"></A>of his brother. And when he had looked upon the end of Afrasiyab, Kai Khosrau 
<A NAME="116"></A>lifted up the sword against him also, and caused him to perish in like 
<A NAME="117"></A>manner as he had slain Saiawush.
<A NAME="118"></A><BR><BR>And when it was done, and the vengeance was complete, the Shah 
<A NAME="119"></A>caused a writing to be sent unto all his lands, and to every noble therein 
<A NAME="120"></A>and every vassal, even from the west unto the east. And he told unto them 
<A NAME="121"></A>therein how that the war of vengeance was ended, and how that the earth 
<A NAME="122"></A>was delivered of the serpent brood. And he bade them think on the arts 
<A NAME="123"></A>of peace and deliver up their hearts to gladness. And when it was done 
<A NAME="124"></A>Kai Kaous made him ready to depart from the world. So he gave thanks unto 
<A NAME="125"></A>God that He had suffered him to see the avenging of Saiawush accomplished, 
<A NAME="126"></A>and he said-
<A NAME="127"></A><BR><BR>"I have beheld my grandson, the light of mine eyes, avenge me and 
<A NAME="128"></A>himself. And now am I ready to go forth unto Thee, for thrice fifty years 
<A NAME="129"></A>have rolled above my head, and my hair is white and my heart is 
<A NAME="130"></A>weary."
<A NAME="131"></A><BR><BR>And after he had thus spoken Kai Kaous passed away, and there remained 
<A NAME="132"></A>of him in the world but the memory of his name. Then Kai Khosrau mourned 
<A NAME="133"></A>for his grandsire as was fitting. But when the days of mourning were ended 
<A NAME="134"></A>he mounted again the throne of the Kaianides, and for sixty years did Kai 
<A NAME="135"></A>Khosrau rule the world in equity, and wisdom flourished under his hands. 
<A NAME="136"></A>And wheresoever the Shah looked he beheld that his hand was stretched out 
<A NAME="137"></A>in gladness, and there was peace in all the lands. Then he gave praise 
<A NAME="138"></A>unto God that He had suffered him to do these things. And when he had done 
<A NAME="139"></A>so he pondered within himself, and he grew afraid lest Ahriman should get 
<A NAME="140"></A>possession of his soul, and lest he should grow uplifted in pride like 
<A NAME="141"></A>unto Jemshid, that forgot whence came his weal and the source of his blessings. 
<A NAME="142"></A>So he said within himself-
<A NAME="143"></A><BR><BR>"It behoveth me to be careful, for I am sprung from the race of 
<A NAME="144"></A>Zohak, and perchance I may become a curse unto the earth, like to him. 
<A NAME="145"></A>Wherefore I will entreat of Ormuzd that He take me unto Himself before 
<A NAME="146"></A>this evil befall me, since there is no longer work for me to do on 
<A NAME="147"></A>earth."
<A NAME="148"></A><BR><BR>Then he gave commandment to the keepers of the curtains that they 
<A NAME="149"></A>suffer no man to enter in upon him, but he bade them refuse it with all 
<A NAME="150"></A>kindness. And when it was done Kai Khosrau withdrew him into the inner 
<A NAME="151"></A>courts, and he ungirded him of his sash of might, and he laved his limbs 
<A NAME="152"></A>in a running stream, and he presented himself in prayer before God his 
<A NAME="153"></A>Maker. And for seven days the Shah stood in the presence of Ormuzd, neither 
<A NAME="154"></A>did he weary to importune Him in prayer.
<A NAME="155"></A><BR><BR>Now while he did so many great ones of Iran came unto the courts 
<A NAME="156"></A>of the Shah and demanded audience. And it was refused them. Then they murmured 
<A NAME="157"></A>among themselves, and they marvelled why the thoughts of the King should 
<A NAME="158"></A>have grown dark in a time of good fortune. And when they found that their 
<A NAME="159"></A>importunity availed them nought, they consulted among themselves what they 
<A NAME="160"></A>should do. Then Gudarz said-
<A NAME="161"></A><BR><BR>"Let us send tidings of these things even unto Zal and Rustem, 
<A NAME="162"></A>and entreat of them that they come unto our aid, for perchance Kai Khosrau 
<A NAME="163"></A>will listen unto their voice."
<A NAME="164"></A><BR><BR>So Gew was sent forth into Zaboulistan.
<A NAME="165"></A><BR>Now when he was gone, it came about that on a certain day, when the 
<A NAME="166"></A>sun had lifted his shield of gold above the world, Kai Khosrau ordained 
<A NAME="167"></A>that the curtains of the audience-chamber be lifted. So there came in unto 
<A NAME="168"></A>him his Mubids and the nobles, and they stood about his throne, and their 
<A NAME="169"></A>hands were crossed in supplication. Then Kai Khosrau, when he saw it, asked 
<A NAME="170"></A>of them what they desired. So they opened their mouths and 
<A NAME="171"></A>said-
<A NAME="172"></A><BR><BR>"May it please the Shah to tell unto us wherein we have failed 
<A NAME="173"></A>that we are shut out from his presence."
<A NAME="174"></A><BR><BR>Then Kai Khosrau answered and said, "The fault is not with you, 
<A NAME="175"></A>and the sight of my nobles is a feast unto mine eyes. But my heart hath 
<A NAME="176"></A>conceived a desire that will not be quieted, and it giveth me rest neither 
<A NAME="177"></A>by day nor by night and I know not how it will end. Yet the time is not 
<A NAME="178"></A>ripe to tell unto you my secrets, but verily I will speak when the hour 
<A NAME="179"></A>is come. Return, therefore, unto your homes, and be glad in your spirits, 
<A NAME="180"></A>and rejoice in the wine-cup, for no foe troubleth the land, and prosperity 
<A NAME="181"></A>hangeth over Iran."
<A NAME="182"></A><BR><BR>Then when he had so spoken, Kai Khosrau dismissed them graciously. 
<A NAME="183"></A>But when they were departed he gave commandment that the curtains be closed, 
<A NAME="184"></A>and that no man be suffered to enter his courts. And he presented him yet 
<A NAME="185"></A>again before God, and he prayed in the fervour of his spirit, and he entreated 
<A NAME="186"></A>of Ormuzd that He would suffer him to depart from the world now that his 
<A NAME="187"></A>task therein was ended. For he beheld that this life is but vanity, and 
<A NAME="188"></A>he yearned to go hence unto his Maker. And for the space of five weeks 
<A NAME="189"></A>did Kai Khosrau stand thus before his God, and he could neither eat nor 
<A NAME="190"></A>sleep, and his heart was disquieted.
<A NAME="191"></A><BR><BR>Now it came about one night that Kai Khosrau fell asleep for weariness. 
<A NAME="192"></A>And there appeared unto him a vision, and the Serosch, the angel of God, 
<A NAME="193"></A>stood before him. And he spake words of comfort to Kai Khosrau, and he 
<A NAME="194"></A>said that the Shah had done that which was right in the sight of God, and 
<A NAME="195"></A>he bade him prepare for his end, and he said-
<A NAME="196"></A><BR><BR>"Before thou goest hence choose from amongst thy nobles a king 
<A NAME="197"></A>that is worthy the throne. And let him be a man that hath a care of all 
<A NAME="198"></A>things that are created, even unto the tiny emmet that creepeth along the 
<A NAME="199"></A>ground. And when thou hast ordered all things, the moment of thy departure 
<A NAME="200"></A>shall be come."
<A NAME="201"></A><BR><BR>When Kai Khosrau awoke from his dream he rejoiced, and poured out 
<A NAME="202"></A>his thanks before God. Then he went unto his throne and seated himself 
<A NAME="203"></A>thereon, and got together his treasures. And he ordered the world for his 
<A NAME="204"></A>departure.
<A NAME="205"></A><BR><BR>Now while he did so, Zal and Rustem, his son, were come unto the 
<A NAME="206"></A>city, and their hearts were filled with sore displeasure because of that 
<A NAME="207"></A>which the nobles had told unto them. And the army came forth to greet them, 
<A NAME="208"></A>and they wept sore, and prayed of Zal that he would turn back unto them 
<A NAME="209"></A>the heart of Kai Khosrau. And they said, "A Deev hath led him astray." 
<A NAME="210"></A>Then Zal and Rustem went in before the Shah. And Kai Khosrau, when he saw 
<A NAME="211"></A>them, was amazed, but he was glad also, and he gave them his hand in greeting. 
<A NAME="212"></A>And he accorded to them seats of honour, as was their due, and when he 
<A NAME="213"></A>had done so, he asked of them wherefore they were come forth. Then Zal 
<A NAME="214"></A>opened his mouth and spake, saying-
<A NAME="215"></A><BR><BR>"I have heard, even in Zaboulistan, that the curtains of the Shah 
<A NAME="216"></A>are closed unto his servants. And the people cry out thereat, and men say 
<A NAME="217"></A>that Kai Khosrau is departed from the path that is right. Wherefore I am 
<A NAME="218"></A>come forth to entreat of thee, if thou have a secret care, that thou confide 
<A NAME="219"></A>it to thy servant, and surely a device may be found. For since the days 
<A NAME="220"></A>of Minuchihr there is no Shah like to thee, but thy nobles are afraid lest 
<A NAME="221"></A>thou stumble in the paths of Zohak and Afrasiyab. Wherefore they entreat 
<A NAME="222"></A>of me that I admonish thee."
<A NAME="223"></A><BR><BR>Now when Kai Khosrau had listened unto the voice of Zal the aged, 
<A NAME="224"></A>he was not angered, but he answered, saying-
<A NAME="225"></A><BR><BR>"O Zal, thou knowest not that whereof thou speakest. For I have 
<A NAME="226"></A>withdrawn myself from men that I might do no evil, and I have prayed unto 
<A NAME="227"></A>God that He take me unto Himself. And now is the Serosch come unto me, 
<A NAME="228"></A>and I know that Ormuzd hath listened unto my voice."
<A NAME="229"></A><BR><BR>When the nobles heard this they were afflicted, but Zal was angered, 
<A NAME="230"></A>and he deemed that the wits of Kai Khosrau were distraught. And he 
<A NAME="231"></A>said-
<A NAME="232"></A><BR><BR>"Since I have stood before the throne of the Kaianides no Shah 
<A NAME="233"></A>hath spoken words like to thine. And I fear that a Deev hath led thee astray, 
<A NAME="234"></A>and I implore of thee that thou listen not unto his voice, and that thou 
<A NAME="235"></A>give ear unto the words of an aged man, and that thou turn thee back into 
<A NAME="236"></A>the path that is right."
<A NAME="237"></A><BR><BR>And when Zal had done speaking, the nobles cried with one accord 
<A NAME="238"></A>that he had spoken for them also. Then Kai Khosrau was sorrowful, but he 
<A NAME="239"></A>would not suffer anger to come into his spirit. And when he had pondered, 
<A NAME="240"></A>he opened his mouth and spake, saying-
<A NAME="241"></A><BR><BR>"O Zal, I have given ear unto the words which thou hast spoken, 
<A NAME="242"></A>give ear now unto the answer. For I have not departed from the paths of 
<A NAME="243"></A>Ormuzd, and no Deev hath led me astray. And I swear it unto thee, even 
<A NAME="244"></A>by God the Most High. But because I am sprung from Afrasiyab the evil one, 
<A NAME="245"></A>and am linked unto the race of Zohak, I am afraid, and I fear to grow like 
<A NAME="246"></A>to Jemshid and Tur, who wearied the world with their oppressions. And, 
<A NAME="247"></A>behold, I have avenged my father, and have made the world submissive unto 
<A NAME="248"></A>my will; and I have established justice in the realm, and the earth is 
<A NAME="249"></A>glad, wherefore there is no longer aught for me to do, for the power of 
<A NAME="250"></A>the wicked is broken. Therefore, lest I grow uplifted in my soul, I have 
<A NAME="251"></A>entreated of Ormuzd that He suffer me now to go hence, even unto Himself. 
<A NAME="252"></A>For I am weary of the throne and of my majesty, and my soul crieth for 
<A NAME="253"></A>rest."
<A NAME="254"></A><BR><BR>When Zal heard these words he was confounded, for he knew that 
<A NAME="255"></A>they were true. And he fell in the dust before the Shah, and he craved 
<A NAME="256"></A>his forgiveness for the hard speech that he had spoken, and he wept, 
<A NAME="257"></A>saying-
<A NAME="258"></A><BR><BR>"O Kai Khosrau, we desire not that thou go hence."
<A NAME="259"></A><BR>And the Shah accorded forgiveness unto the old man, because of the 
<A NAME="260"></A>great love he bare him; and he lifted him from the ground and kissed him. 
<A NAME="261"></A>And when he had done so, he bade him go forth with Rustem. And he commanded 
<A NAME="262"></A>that the nobles and all their armies should camp upon the plains. And Zal 
<A NAME="263"></A>did as the Shah desired, and the hosts were encamped without the 
<A NAME="264"></A>doors.
<A NAME="265"></A><BR><BR>Now when it was done, Kai Khosrau mounted upon the crystal throne, 
<A NAME="266"></A>and he held in his hand the ox-headed mace, and he bare on his head the 
<A NAME="267"></A>crown of the Kaianides, and a sash of might was girded round his loins. 
<A NAME="268"></A>And on his right hand stood Rustem the Pehliva, and on his left Zal the 
<A NAME="269"></A>aged. And he lifted up his voice and spake words of wisdom unto his army; 
<A NAME="270"></A>and he said unto them that the sojourn of man was brief upon the earth, 
<A NAME="271"></A>and that it became him to remember his end. And he said how he had also 
<A NAME="272"></A>bethought him of his death. And he spake, saying-
<A NAME="273"></A><BR><BR>"I have made me ready to depart, and my testament will I speak 
<A NAME="274"></A>before you. I will give richly unto those that have wearied themselves 
<A NAME="275"></A>in my service, and of those to whom I owe gratitude I will speak unto God, 
<A NAME="276"></A>and implore of Him that He reward them according to their deserts. And 
<A NAME="277"></A>I give unto the Iranians my gold, and my armour, and my jewels, and whosoever 
<A NAME="278"></A>is great among you to him do I give a province."
<A NAME="279"></A><BR><BR>Thus for the space of seven days did the Shah sit upon his throne 
<A NAME="280"></A>and order his treasurer how he should act. Then on the eighth he called 
<A NAME="281"></A>before him Gudarz the wise, and he gave to him instructions. And he bade 
<A NAME="282"></A>him be kind unto the poor, and the widowed, and the fatherless, and he 
<A NAME="283"></A>entreated him to dry the eye of care. Then he gave unto him much treasure, 
<A NAME="284"></A>and rendered unto him thanks for the services that he had done before him. 
<A NAME="285"></A>And he gave rich gifts also unto Zal, and Gew, and Rustem, and to all his 
<A NAME="286"></A>nobles, according to their degree. And he desired of them that they should 
<A NAME="287"></A>ask a boon at his hands, and whatsoever it was he gave it. And he spake, 
<A NAME="288"></A>saying-
<A NAME="289"></A><BR><BR>"May my memory be hateful unto none."
<A NAME="290"></A><BR>Then he called before him Rustem, and praised the mighty deeds that 
<A NAME="291"></A>he had done, and he invoked the blessings of Heaven upon his Pehliva. And 
<A NAME="292"></A>after many days, when all these things were accomplished, the Shah was 
<A NAME="293"></A>weary, but his task was not yet fulfilled. For there was one among the 
<A NAME="294"></A>nobles whose name he had not named. And the others knew thereof, but they 
<A NAME="295"></A>ventured not again to admonish Kai Khosrau, for they were amazed at his 
<A NAME="296"></A>wisdom and his justice, and they saw that he did that which was 
<A NAME="297"></A>right.
<A NAME="298"></A><BR><BR>Now after some time the Shah opened his mouth and called before 
<A NAME="299"></A>him Byzun, and he said-
<A NAME="300"></A><BR><BR>"Lead forth before me Lohurasp, who is sprung from the seed of 
<A NAME="301"></A>Husheng, the Shah."
<A NAME="302"></A><BR><BR>And Byzun did as Kai Khosrau commanded.
<A NAME="303"></A><BR>Now when he had brought Lohurasp before the throne, Kai Khosrau descended 
<A NAME="304"></A>from its height, and he gave his hand unto Lohurasp and blessed him. Then 
<A NAME="305"></A>he put upon his head the crown of the Kaianides and saluted him Shah, and 
<A NAME="306"></A>he said-
<A NAME="307"></A><BR><BR>"May the world be submissive to thy will."
<A NAME="308"></A><BR>But the nobles, when they saw it, were confounded, and they murmured 
<A NAME="309"></A>among themselves that Lohurasp should have the kingdom, and they questioned 
<A NAME="310"></A>wherefore they should pay allegiance unto him. Then Kai Khosrau was angered, 
<A NAME="311"></A>and he opened his lips, saying-
<A NAME="312"></A><BR><BR>"Ye speak of that ye know not, and haste hath unbridled your tongues. 
<A NAME="313"></A>For I say unto you that which I have done I have done justly, and in the 
<A NAME="314"></A>sight of God, and I know that Lohurasp is a man worthy the throne, and 
<A NAME="315"></A>that Iran will prosper under his hands. And I desire that ye salute him 
<A NAME="316"></A>Shah, and whosoever regardeth not this, my last desire, I hold him a rebel 
<A NAME="317"></A>unto God, and judgment shall fall upon him."
<A NAME="318"></A><BR><BR>Now Zal, when he heard these words, knew that they were just. So 
<A NAME="319"></A>he stepped out from among the nobles and came before Lohurasp, and did 
<A NAME="320"></A>obeisance unto him as to the Shah. And the army, when they saw it, shouted 
<A NAME="321"></A>their homage also, and all the land of Iran was made acquainted with the 
<A NAME="322"></A>tidings.
<A NAME="323"></A><BR><BR>Now when it was done, Kai Khosrau turned him to his nobles, 
<A NAME="324"></A>saying-
<A NAME="325"></A><BR><BR>"I go now to prepare my spirit for death." And when he had so spoken 
<A NAME="326"></A>he entered behind the curtains of his house. And he called before him his 
<A NAME="327"></A>women, and he told unto them how he should depart. And they wept sore at 
<A NAME="328"></A>the tidings. Then Kai Khosrau confided them unto Lohurasp, and he gave 
<A NAME="329"></A>to him safe counsels, and he said-
<A NAME="330"></A><BR><BR>"Be thou the woof and the warp of justice."
<A NAME="331"></A><BR>And when all was ready, he gat him upon his horse to go forth into 
<A NAME="332"></A>the mountains. And Lohurasp would have gone also, but Kai Khosrau suffered 
<A NAME="333"></A>it not. But there went with him Zal and Rustem, Gudarz also, and Gustahem 
<A NAME="334"></A>and Gew, and Byzun the valiant, and Friburz, the son of Kai Kaous, and 
<A NAME="335"></A>Tus the Pehliva. And they followed after him from the plains unto the crest 
<A NAME="336"></A>of the mountains. And they ceased not from mourning that which was done 
<A NAME="337"></A>of Kai Khosrau, and they said among themselves that never had Shah done 
<A NAME="338"></A>like unto him. And they strove to change his purpose. But Kai Khosrau said 
<A NAME="339"></A>unto them-
<A NAME="340"></A><BR><BR>"All is well, wherefore weep ye and trouble my spirit? 
<A NAME="341"></A>"
<A NAME="342"></A><BR>Now when they were gone with him the space of seven days, Kai Khosrau 
<A NAME="343"></A>turned unto his nobles and spake, saying-
<A NAME="344"></A><BR><BR>"Return now upon the road that ye are come, for I am about to enter 
<A NAME="345"></A>in upon a path where neither herb nor water can be found. Wherefore I entreat 
<A NAME="346"></A>of you that ye spare yourselves this weariness."
<A NAME="347"></A><BR><BR>Then Zal and Rustem, and Gudarz the aged, listened unto the voice 
<A NAME="348"></A>of the Shah, for they knew that he spake that which it became them to obey. 
<A NAME="349"></A>But the others refused ear unto his voice, and they followed after him 
<A NAME="350"></A>yet another day, but their force was spent in the desert. Now when the 
<A NAME="351"></A>evening of that day was come they found a running stream. Then Kai Khosrau 
<A NAME="352"></A>said, "Let us halt in this spot." And when they were encamped he spake 
<A NAME="353"></A>unto them of the things that were past, and he said unto them that when 
<A NAME="354"></A>the sun should have lifted up its face anew they should behold him no longer 
<A NAME="355"></A>in their midst, for the time of his departure was at hand. And when the 
<A NAME="356"></A>night was fallen he drew aside and bathed his body in the water, and prayed 
<A NAME="357"></A>unto God his Maker. Then he came yet again before his nobles, and he awakened 
<A NAME="358"></A>them from their slumbers, and he spake unto them words of parting. And 
<A NAME="359"></A>he said-
<A NAME="360"></A><BR><BR>"When the daylight shall be come back, I say unto you, return upon 
<A NAME="361"></A>your path, neither linger in this place, though it should rain musk and 
<A NAME="362"></A>amber, for out of the mountains a great storm will arise that shall uproot 
<A NAME="363"></A>the trees and strip the leaves from off their branches. And there shall 
<A NAME="364"></A>come a fall of snow such as Iran hath not seen the like. But if ye do not 
<A NAME="365"></A>as I say unto you, verily ye shall never find the path of 
<A NAME="366"></A>return."
<A NAME="367"></A><BR><BR>Now the nobles were troubled when they heard these words, and the 
<A NAME="368"></A>slumber that fell upon their eyelids was fined with sorrow. But when the 
<A NAME="369"></A>raven of night flew upwards, and the glory of the world flooded the earth 
<A NAME="370"></A>with its light, Kai Khosrau was vanished from among them, and they sought 
<A NAME="371"></A>out his traces in vain. Now when they beheld that he was gone, they wept 
<A NAME="372"></A>in the bitterness of their hearts, and Friburz spake, 
<A NAME="373"></A>saying-
<A NAME="374"></A><BR><BR>"O my friends, listen to the words that I shall speak. I pray of 
<A NAME="375"></A>you, let us linger yet a while in this spot, lest peradventure Kai Khosrau 
<A NAME="376"></A>should return. And since it is good to be here, I know not wherefore we 
<A NAME="377"></A>should haste to depart."
<A NAME="378"></A><BR><BR>And the nobles listened to his voice, and they encamped them on 
<A NAME="379"></A>this spot, and they spake continually of Kai Khosrau, and wept for him, 
<A NAME="380"></A>but they forgot the commandment that he had spoken. Now while they slept 
<A NAME="381"></A>there arose a mighty wind, and it brought forth clouds, and the sky grew 
<A NAME="382"></A>dark, and before the daylight was come back unto the world the earth was 
<A NAME="383"></A>wrapped in snow like to a shroud, and none could tell the valleys and the 
<A NAME="384"></A>hills asunder. And the nobles, when they awoke, knew not whither they should 
<A NAME="385"></A>turn, and they sought after their path in vain. And the snow fell down 
<A NAME="386"></A>upon them, and they could not free them of its might, and though they strove 
<A NAME="387"></A>against it, it rose above their heads and buried them, and after a little 
<A NAME="388"></A>the life departed out of their bodies.
<A NAME="389"></A><BR><BR>Now after many days, when Zal, and Rustem, and Gudarz beheld that 
<A NAME="390"></A>the nobles returned not, they grew afraid and sent forth riders to seek 
<A NAME="391"></A>them. And the men searched long, but in the end they found the bodies, 
<A NAME="392"></A>and they bare them down into the plains. And sore was the wailing in the 
<A NAME="393"></A>army when they beheld it, and a noble tomb was raised above their heads. 
<A NAME="394"></A>But Lohurasp, when he learned that Kai Khosrau was vanished, mounted the 
<A NAME="395"></A>throne of the Kaianides. And he called before him his people that they 
<A NAME="396"></A>should do allegiance unto him. And they did so, and the place of Kai Khosrau 
<A NAME="397"></A>knew him no more.
