<A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A>Peace reigned again within the borders of Iran, and P the sword slept in 
<A NAME="11"></A>its scabbard, and Kai Khosrau ordered the world with wisdom. And men rejoiced 
<A NAME="12"></A>that the glory of Turan had been brought low, and the Shah feasted his 
<A NAME="13"></A>nobles in lightness of heart.
<A NAME="14"></A><BR><BR>Now it came about one day that while they were shortening the hours 
<A NAME="15"></A>with wine there entered in unto them the keeper of the curtains of the 
<A NAME="16"></A>door. And he said that men from Arman stood without and craved an audience. 
<A NAME="17"></A>Then Kai Khosrau bade that they be let in. So the men came before him, 
<A NAME="18"></A>and they uttered cries of lamentation, and they fell down at his feet and 
<A NAME="19"></A>implored his aid. And Kai Khosrau said-
<A NAME="20"></A><BR><BR>"Who hath done you wrong?"
<A NAME="21"></A><BR>Then the men answered, "Our wrong cometh unto us from the borders of 
<A NAME="22"></A>Turan, for there issue forth thence wild boars that break into our fields 
<A NAME="23"></A>and do destruction to our crops. And our fortunes are entwined with the 
<A NAME="24"></A>ground, and no man can overcome these beasts. Wherefore, we pray thee, 
<A NAME="25"></A>send forth a Pehliva that he may subdue them, for our land groaneth under 
<A NAME="26"></A>this plague."
<A NAME="27"></A><BR><BR>Then Kai Khosrau said, "It shall be done as you desire," and he 
<A NAME="28"></A>dismissed them graciously. Then he called before him his treasurer, and 
<A NAME="29"></A>bade him bring forth precious stones, and horses with girdles of gold, 
<A NAME="30"></A>and rich brocades of Roum. And when they were placed before him he showed 
<A NAME="31"></A>them to his nobles, and he said that whoever would go forth to combat the 
<A NAME="32"></A>wild boars should not find him close-handed. But for a while none answered, 
<A NAME="33"></A>for no man listed to go forth to battle with wild beasts. Then Byzun, the 
<A NAME="34"></A>son of Gew, arose and spake, saying-
<A NAME="35"></A><BR><BR>"If the Shah will grant leave unto me, I will go forth and slay 
<A NAME="36"></A>these foes."
<A NAME="37"></A><BR><BR>Now Gew was grieved thereat, because that Byzun was his only son, 
<A NAME="38"></A>and he feared for his youth. Therefore he sought to restrain him. But Byzun 
<A NAME="39"></A>suffered it not, and he said-
<A NAME="40"></A><BR><BR>"O King, listen unto my desires; for though I be young in years, 
<A NAME="41"></A>yet am I old in prudence, and I will do nought that is not fitting unto 
<A NAME="42"></A>thy slave."
<A NAME="43"></A><BR><BR>And Kai Khosrau granted his request, but he bade him take forth 
<A NAME="44"></A>with him Girgin, the wise in counsel, that he should guide him aright. 
<A NAME="45"></A>And Byzun did as the Shah desired, and they set forth unto the land of 
<A NAME="46"></A>Arman.
<A NAME="47"></A><BR><BR>Now when they were come unto the wood they rested them, and made 
<A NAME="48"></A>a great fire, and drank wine until they were refreshed. Then Girgin would 
<A NAME="49"></A>have laid him down to slumber. But Byzun said-
<A NAME="50"></A><BR><BR>"Not so, let us go forth and seek the wild boars."
<A NAME="51"></A><BR>Then Girgin said, "Go thou alone, for it is thou who hast engaged in 
<A NAME="52"></A>this combat, and who hast taken to thyself the gifts of the Shah. Therefore 
<A NAME="53"></A>it behoveth me only to look on."
<A NAME="54"></A><BR><BR>When Byzun heard these words he was amazed, but he regarded them 
<A NAME="55"></A>not, and he entered in upon the forest. And after a while he came upon 
<A NAME="56"></A>the wild boars, and they fell upon him. But he slew them with his mace, 
<A NAME="57"></A>and he reddened the ground with their gore, and he went after them, even 
<A NAME="58"></A>unto their lairs, and not one of them did he suffer to escape. Then when 
<A NAME="59"></A>he had done thus, he parted their mighty teeth from off their heads and 
<A NAME="60"></A>hung them about his saddle, that the men of Iran might behold them. And 
<A NAME="61"></A>after this he turned him back unto Girgin.
<A NAME="62"></A><BR><BR>Now Girgin, when he beheld him mounted upon his horse, and bearing 
<A NAME="63"></A>round his saddle the tokens of his triumph, was envious thereat. And with 
<A NAME="64"></A>his mouth he gave him joy, but Ahriman took hold of his spirit. So he pondered 
<A NAME="65"></A>all night long how he could lay a snare for Byzun. And when the morning 
<A NAME="66"></A>was come he praised his prowess, and they quaffed wine together, and fair 
<A NAME="67"></A>words were exchanged between them. Then Girgin said-
<A NAME="68"></A><BR><BR>"This land is known unto me, for I sojourned here with Rustem. 
<A NAME="69"></A>And I know that at the distance of two farsangs lies the garden of Afrasiyab, 
<A NAME="70"></A>where his women go forth to keep the feast of spring. And I bethink me 
<A NAME="71"></A>that the time is at hand. Wherefore, I say unto thee, let us go hence, 
<A NAME="72"></A>and behold with our eyes the fair ones whom the King of Turan hideth behind 
<A NAME="73"></A>his curtains."
<A NAME="74"></A><BR><BR>Now these words inflamed the blood of Byzun, and he gave ear unto 
<A NAME="75"></A>Girgin, for he was young, and he acted like a young man. So they set forth 
<A NAME="76"></A>upon the road, and Girgin filled the mind of Byzun with feasts and with 
<A NAME="77"></A>sounds of music. And when they were come unto the spot, Byzun burned with 
<A NAME="78"></A>impatience to look upon the women of Afrasiyab. And Girgin feigned as though 
<A NAME="79"></A>he would restrain his foot within the skirt of patience, but he rejoiced 
<A NAME="80"></A>in secret, for he hoped that from this deed evil would arise. So Byzun 
<A NAME="81"></A>sped forth unto the garden, and he hid himself beneath the shade of a tall 
<A NAME="82"></A>cypress, and he feasted his eyes upon the beauty of the women. And the 
<A NAME="83"></A>garden was clad in its robes of spring, and the world was green and fair, 
<A NAME="84"></A>and all the air was filled with the sweet sounds of music and of song. 
<A NAME="85"></A>And there moved amid the rose-bushes maidens of Peri face, and in stature 
<A NAME="86"></A>they were like to the cypress-trees, and one was exalted above them all. 
<A NAME="87"></A>And she was daughter unto Afrasiyab, and Manijeh was she 
<A NAME="88"></A>named.
<A NAME="89"></A><BR><BR>Now it came about that as Manijeh stood at the door of her tent 
<A NAME="90"></A>she beheld Byzun where he was hid. And she marvelled at his beauty, and 
<A NAME="91"></A>her heart was captive unto him. So she called about her her maidens, and 
<A NAME="92"></A>said-
<A NAME="93"></A><BR><BR>"Go forth and question the stranger who regardeth us, for I bethink 
<A NAME="94"></A>me that he is a Peri, or that Saiawush is come back unto the earth, for 
<A NAME="95"></A>no mortal can own such beauty, neither can any man enter 
<A NAME="96"></A>here."
<A NAME="97"></A><BR><BR>Then one went forth and bare unto Byzun this message. And his heart 
<A NAME="98"></A>leaped thereat, and he said-
<A NAME="99"></A><BR><BR>"Say unto your mistress that I am come forth from Iran to slay 
<A NAME="100"></A>the wild boars of Arman. And I came hither that perchance I might gaze 
<A NAME="101"></A>upon the face of the daughter of Afrasiyab, for tidings of her beauty were 
<A NAME="102"></A>told unto me, and reached even unto Iran. Go, therefore, and ask if I may 
<A NAME="103"></A>speak with her."
<A NAME="104"></A><BR><BR>Then the handmaidens did as Byzun desired, and Manijeh said, "Let 
<A NAME="105"></A>him come forth."
<A NAME="106"></A><BR><BR>So Byzun entered into the tents of Manijeh, and she received him 
<A NAME="107"></A>with joy, and she caused his feet to be washed with musk and amber, and 
<A NAME="108"></A>she poured jewels before him, and prepared for him a feast of sweet meats. 
<A NAME="109"></A>And slaves stood around and made soft music, and the heart of Byzun was 
<A NAME="110"></A>ensnared in the meshes of the net that had been spread. And three days 
<A NAME="111"></A>and three nights did he sojourn beside Manijeh, and his passion for her 
<A NAME="112"></A>waxed greater, and he thought not of Iran, neither of the time of departure. 
<A NAME="113"></A>And Manijeh too rejoiced in his presence, and when the time was come for 
<A NAME="114"></A>her to quit the garden of spring she would not part with him. So she gave 
<A NAME="115"></A>unto him a cup wherein she had mingled a potion. And the wine caused Byzun 
<A NAME="116"></A>to sleep, and while he slept the maidens bare him in a litter even into 
<A NAME="117"></A>the house of Afrasiyab. And Manijeh hid him behind the curtains of the 
<A NAME="118"></A>women, and none, save only her handmaidens, were aware of his 
<A NAME="119"></A>presence.
<A NAME="120"></A><BR><BR>Now when Byzun awoke he asked whither he was come, and when he 
<A NAME="121"></A>learned that he was in the house of Afrasiyab he was afraid, and desired 
<A NAME="122"></A>to return unto Iran. But Manijeh quieted his distrust, and he forgot his 
<A NAME="123"></A>fears in her love. And she made the earth glad about him, and the hours 
<A NAME="124"></A>fled on the wings of wine and of joy. And many days sped thus, and none 
<A NAME="125"></A>knew what passed in the house of the women.
<A NAME="126"></A><BR><BR>Then it came about that a guardian of the door learned thereof, 
<A NAME="127"></A>and he came before Afrasiyab, and told unto him that his daughter hid within 
<A NAME="128"></A>her house a man of the race of Iran. And Afrasiyab, when he learned it, 
<A NAME="129"></A>was beside himself with anger, and he cursed Manijeh, and he 
<A NAME="130"></A>said-
<A NAME="131"></A><BR><BR>"The hour is come unto this man."
<A NAME="132"></A><BR>Then he called for Gersiwaz, his brother, and bade him go forth with 
<A NAME="133"></A>a band of armed men unto the house of the women. And Gersiwaz did as Afrasiyab 
<A NAME="134"></A>commanded, and he put guards at all the doors. Then the sounds of lutes 
<A NAME="135"></A>and of rejoicing fell upon his ear, for none were aware of the vengeance 
<A NAME="136"></A>that was come upon them. And when Gersiwaz was come unto the house of Manijeh, 
<A NAME="137"></A>the daughter of Afrasiyab, he brake open the doors, and stood in the midst 
<A NAME="138"></A>of the revels. And he beheld within the chamber many slaves playing on 
<A NAME="139"></A>lutes of gold, and fair women that handed the wine-cups. And Manijeh was 
<A NAME="140"></A>seated upon a throne of gold, and beside her was Byzun, the son of Gew, 
<A NAME="141"></A>the Iranian, and joy was painted on his visage.
<A NAME="142"></A><BR><BR>Now when Gersiwaz beheld Byzun, he cried, "O vile man, thou art 
<A NAME="143"></A>fallen into my hands! How wilt thou now save thy life? 
<A NAME="144"></A>"
<A NAME="145"></A><BR><BR>And Byzun was dismayed, for he had neither sword nor armour, and 
<A NAME="146"></A>he thought within himself-
<A NAME="147"></A><BR><BR>"I fear me that my life will end this day."
<A NAME="148"></A><BR>But he drew forth from his boot a dagger that was hidden therein, and 
<A NAME="149"></A>he threatened Gersiwaz, and he said that he would plunge it into his breast 
<A NAME="150"></A>if he led him not before Afrasiyab.
<A NAME="151"></A><BR><BR>Now Gersiwaz knew that Byzun was quick to act, and would do that 
<A NAME="152"></A>which he spake, so he held back from combat, and he seized Byzun and bound 
<A NAME="153"></A>him, and led him before Afrasiyab. And when Afrasiyab saw him in such plight, 
<A NAME="154"></A>he said-
<A NAME="155"></A><BR><BR>"O man of evil, wherefore didst thou come into my 
<A NAME="156"></A>land?"
<A NAME="157"></A><BR>Then Byzun told him how he was gone forth to slay the boars, and how 
<A NAME="158"></A>he was come into the garden of Afrasiyab, and he said that a Peri had borne 
<A NAME="159"></A>him unto the palace, for he would not do hurt unto Manijeh. But Afrasiyab 
<A NAME="160"></A>refused belief unto his words, and he commanded that a gibbet should be 
<A NAME="161"></A>raised without his court, and that Byzun be hung thereon, because he had 
<A NAME="162"></A>dishonoured the house of the women, and had stolen like a thief in the 
<A NAME="163"></A>night into the house of the King. And in vain did Byzun invoke mercy at 
<A NAME="164"></A>the hands of Afrasiyab, and he was led forth beyond the courts. And the 
<A NAME="165"></A>men of Afrasiyab made ready the gallows, and Byzun stood bound beneath. 
<A NAME="166"></A>And he wept sore in his distress, and he prayed to the winds that they 
<A NAME="167"></A>would bear tidings of him unto the Shah of Iran, and he sware that his 
<A NAME="168"></A>death should be avenged upon Turan.
<A NAME="169"></A><BR><BR>Now while he waited thus there passed by Piran, the Pehliva, who 
<A NAME="170"></A>was come forth to do homage unto the King. And when he beheld the gibbet 
<A NAME="171"></A>he questioned concerning it, and when he learned that it was for Byzun 
<A NAME="172"></A>he was troubled. So he got him from his horse and came near unto the youth, 
<A NAME="173"></A>and questioned him of this adventure. And Byzun told him all that was come 
<A NAME="174"></A>about, and how his evil comrade had laid for him a snare. Then Piran commanded 
<A NAME="175"></A>that punishment be stayed until he should have spoken unto Afrasiyab. And 
<A NAME="176"></A>he went in and stood before the King as a suppliant. Then Afrasiyab bade 
<A NAME="177"></A>him make known his desires. And Piran opened his mouth and spake words 
<A NAME="178"></A>of wisdom unto Afrasiyab, his King. And he reminded him of the death of 
<A NAME="179"></A>Saiawush, and how Byzun was of much account in his own country, and how 
<A NAME="180"></A>surely his blood would be avenged. And he said how the land of Turan was 
<A NAME="181"></A>not ready to stand again in a new war, and he prayed Afrasiyab to content 
<A NAME="182"></A>him with a dungeon. And he said-
<A NAME="183"></A><BR><BR>"Heap chains upon Byzun, and let the earth hide him, that Iran 
<A NAME="184"></A>may not know whither he is vanished."
<A NAME="185"></A><BR><BR>Now Afrasiyab knew that the words of Piran were wise, and he gave 
<A NAME="186"></A>ear unto them. So Byzun was led forth unto a desert place and he was laden 
<A NAME="187"></A>with chains of iron and his tender flesh was bound and he was thrown into 
<A NAME="188"></A>a deep hole. And the opening thereof was closed with a mighty stone that 
<A NAME="189"></A>the Deev Akwan had torn from the nethermost sea, and neither sun nor moon 
<A NAME="190"></A>could be seen by Byzun, and Afrasiyab trusted that his reason would forsake 
<A NAME="191"></A>him in this pit. And when he had done thus unto Byzun, he bade Gersiwaz 
<A NAME="192"></A>go in unto the house of the daughter that had dishonoured him, and tear 
<A NAME="193"></A>off her costly robes, and her crown, and her veil. And he 
<A NAME="194"></A>said-
<A NAME="195"></A><BR><BR>"Let her be cast forth also into the desert, that she may behold 
<A NAME="196"></A>the dungeon wherein Byzun is hid. And say unto her, 'Thou hast been his 
<A NAME="197"></A>Spring, be now his comforter, and wait upon him in his narrow 
<A NAME="198"></A>prison."'
<A NAME="199"></A><BR><BR>And Gersiwaz did as Afrasiyab commanded, and he tore the veil from 
<A NAME="200"></A>off Manijeh, and he caused her to walk barefooted unto the spot where Byzun 
<A NAME="201"></A>was hid.
<A NAME="202"></A><BR><BR>Now Manijeh was bowed down with sorrow, and she wept sore, and 
<A NAME="203"></A>she wandered through the desert day and night bewailing her fate. And ever 
<A NAME="204"></A>did she return unto the pit, and she sought how she might enter therein. 
<A NAME="205"></A>But she could not move the mighty stone that closed its mouth. Yet after 
<A NAME="206"></A>some days were gone by she found an opening where she could thrust in her 
<A NAME="207"></A>hand. Now when she had found it she rejoiced, and daily she went forth 
<A NAME="208"></A>unto the city and begged of men that they would give her bread. And none 
<A NAME="209"></A>knew her for the daughter of Afrasiyab, but all had pity upon her sorry 
<A NAME="210"></A>plight, and they gave her freely of that which they had. And she returned 
<A NAME="211"></A>with it unto Byzun, and she fed him through the hole that she had made. 
<A NAME="212"></A>And she spake unto him sweet words of comfort, and she kept his heart alive 
<A NAME="213"></A>within him.
<A NAME="214"></A><BR><BR>Now while these things were passing in Turan, Girgin was returned 
<A NAME="215"></A>unto Iran much discomfited. And he pondered how he should come before the 
<A NAME="216"></A>Shah, and what he should say unto Gew. And he told them that they had of 
<A NAME="217"></A>their combined strength overcome the boars, and he boasted that he had 
<A NAME="218"></A>done deeds of great prowess, and he said that a wild ass was come forth 
<A NAME="219"></A>out of the forest and had borne away Byzun from before his eyes, and verily 
<A NAME="220"></A>he held that it must be a Deev. Then Kai Khosrau questioned him closely, 
<A NAME="221"></A>and when he had done so he saw that Girgin held not unto his story. So 
<A NAME="222"></A>his mind misgave him, and he commanded that Girgin be put in chains. And 
<A NAME="223"></A>he said-
<A NAME="224"></A><BR><BR>"I will guard thee until I have learned tidings of 
<A NAME="225"></A>Byzun."
<A NAME="226"></A><BR>Now Gew was beside himself with grief because of his only son, whom 
<A NAME="227"></A>he loved, but Kai Khosrau spake comfort unto his soul. And he bade riders 
<A NAME="228"></A>go forth unto all corners of the wind to seek tidings of Byzun, and he 
<A NAME="229"></A>said-
<A NAME="230"></A><BR><BR>"If I learn nought concerning him until the feast of Neurouz be 
<A NAME="231"></A>come, I will search for him in the crystal globe wherein I can behold the 
<A NAME="232"></A>world, and read the secrets of destiny."
<A NAME="233"></A><BR><BR>Now when the horsemen had sought Byzun in vain throughout the plains 
<A NAME="234"></A>of Iran and in the gorges of the land of Arman, they returned them unto 
<A NAME="235"></A>the courts of the Shah. So when the feast of Neurouz was come, Kai Khosrau 
<A NAME="236"></A>clothed himself in a robe of Roum, and he took from off his head the crown 
<A NAME="237"></A>of the Kaianides, and he presented himself in humility before Ormuzd. Then 
<A NAME="238"></A>he took in his hand the globe of crystal, and he prayed to God that He 
<A NAME="239"></A>would grant unto him to behold the seven zones of the world. And God granted 
<A NAME="240"></A>it. And Kai Khosrau surveyed all the lands of the earth, and nowhere upon 
<A NAME="241"></A>them could he behold Byzun. And he was downcast and sad in his spirit, 
<A NAME="242"></A>for he deemed that Byzun was departed from the world. Then Ormuzd showed 
<A NAME="243"></A>unto him where he was hidden in a pit, and Kai Khosrau beheld him, and 
<A NAME="244"></A>the damsel that watched beside him. So he called before him Gew, and 
<A NAME="245"></A>said-
<A NAME="246"></A><BR><BR>"Let thy heart cease from sorrow, for thy son liveth, and he is 
<A NAME="247"></A>tended by a maiden of noble birth. But he is bound, and a mighty stone 
<A NAME="248"></A>is laid above his prison, and Rustem alone can deliver him. Wherefore I 
<A NAME="249"></A>counsel thee, speed forth unto Zaboulistan and entreat the son of Zal that 
<A NAME="250"></A>he come unto our aid yet again."
<A NAME="251"></A><BR><BR>Then Kai Khosrau wrote a letter unto Rustem, wherein he told him 
<A NAME="252"></A>all that was come about, and he gave the writing unto Gew. And Gew sped 
<A NAME="253"></A>forth therewith unto Zaboulistan.
<A NAME="254"></A><BR><BR>Now when he was come within the courts of Rustem, Zal beheld him 
<A NAME="255"></A>from afar, and he feared that evil was come upon Iran since the Shah sent 
<A NAME="256"></A>forth a man of might like unto Gew to be his messenger. So he came forth 
<A NAME="257"></A>in haste and questioned him. And when he learned his mission he bade him 
<A NAME="258"></A>come within, and he told him how Rustem was gone forth to chase the wild 
<A NAME="259"></A>ass, and he made a feast for him, and entertained him until his son was 
<A NAME="260"></A>returned within the courts. Now when Rustem learned the tidings, his eyes 
<A NAME="261"></A>were filled with tears, but he spake comfort unto Gew, and he 
<A NAME="262"></A>said-
<A NAME="263"></A><BR><BR>"Be not disquieted, for verily Rustem shall not remove the saddle 
<A NAME="264"></A>from Rakush until he hath grasped the hand of Byzun, and broken his chains 
<A NAME="265"></A>and his prison."
<A NAME="266"></A><BR><BR>And when he had read the letter of the Shah, he made him ready 
<A NAME="267"></A>to go, before Kai Khosrau. And when he was come into his presence, he did 
<A NAME="268"></A>obeisance before him, and he said-
<A NAME="269"></A><BR><BR>"O King of kings, I am ready to do thy commandments, for my mother 
<A NAME="270"></A>brought me into the world that I might weary myself for thee, and unto 
<A NAME="271"></A>thee pertaineth rest and joy, and unto me combat everlasting."
<A NAME="272"></A><BR><BR>Then he chose forth from among the warriors men of renown, that 
<A NAME="273"></A>they should go out with him to deliver Byzun. And Girgin sent greeting 
<A NAME="274"></A>unto Rustem, and craved of him that he would plead for him with the Shah. 
<A NAME="275"></A>And he bewailed his fault, and he entreated that he might go out to succour 
<A NAME="276"></A>Byzun. And Rustem asked his forgiveness of Kai Khosrau, and when the Shah 
<A NAME="277"></A>would have refused his suit, he pressed him hard. So Kai Khosrau listened 
<A NAME="278"></A>to the desires of his Pehliva. Then he said unto him-
<A NAME="279"></A><BR><BR>"Tell me what men and treasures thou desirest to bear with thee 
<A NAME="280"></A>into Turan."
<A NAME="281"></A><BR><BR>And Rustem said, "I desire not a large army, for I think to regain 
<A NAME="282"></A>Byzun by the arts of wile. Give unto me, therefore, jewels and rich brocades, 
<A NAME="283"></A>and carpets, and stuffs of value, for I purpose to go forth in the garb 
<A NAME="284"></A>of a merchant."
<A NAME="285"></A><BR><BR>Then Kai Khosrau gave him the key to all his treasures, and Rustem 
<A NAME="286"></A>chose forth rich stuffs, and loaded them upon an hundred camels. And he 
<A NAME="287"></A>desired seven valiant knights that they should go forth with him clad in 
<A NAME="288"></A>the dress of merchants, and that an army be posted in secret upon the borders. 
<A NAME="289"></A>And when all was ready the caravan went forth. And they journeyed until 
<A NAME="290"></A>they came into the town of Khoten, and all the people came forth to gaze 
<A NAME="291"></A>upon their merchandise. Then Rustem, in his disguise, went unto the house 
<A NAME="292"></A>of Piran, and he poured gifts before him, and he asked leave of him that 
<A NAME="293"></A>he might remain within the borders to sell his wares. And Piran granted 
<A NAME="294"></A>his request. So Rustem took for himself a house, and showed his goods unto 
<A NAME="295"></A>the people, and bartered them, and it was noised through all the land that 
<A NAME="296"></A>a caravan was come out from Iran, and all who had need of aught flocked 
<A NAME="297"></A>into the city. And the news spread even unto the ears of Manijeh. And when 
<A NAME="298"></A>she learned that it was men of Iran who were come forth, she made her way 
<A NAME="299"></A>unto the city, and came before Rustem and questioned him, 
<A NAME="300"></A>saying-
<A NAME="301"></A><BR><BR>"What news is there abroad in Iran concerning Byzun, the son of 
<A NAME="302"></A>Gew, and doth no army come forth to save him? O noble merchant, I entreat 
<A NAME="303"></A>of thee when thou goest back to thy land, to seek out Gew, and Kai Khosrau, 
<A NAME="304"></A>and Rustem the mighty, and bring unto them tidings of Byzun, lest he perish 
<A NAME="305"></A>in his chains."
<A NAME="306"></A><BR><BR>Now Rustem, when he heard her words, was afraid for his secret, 
<A NAME="307"></A>for he knew not who she was. Wherefore he spoke roughly unto her, and he 
<A NAME="308"></A>said-
<A NAME="309"></A><BR><BR>"I am a man of peace and of ignoble birth, a merchant, and I know 
<A NAME="310"></A>nought of Gew, or of Byzun, or of the Shah. Get thee hence, maiden, thou 
<A NAME="311"></A>dost but hinder my business, and this alone concerneth 
<A NAME="312"></A>me."
<A NAME="313"></A><BR><BR>When he had thus spoken, Manijeh looked on him with sorrow, and 
<A NAME="314"></A>wept, saying-
<A NAME="315"></A><BR><BR>"Do the men of Iran refuse tidings unto the 
<A NAME="316"></A>poor?"
<A NAME="317"></A><BR>Then Rustem repented him of his harshness, and said-
<A NAME="318"></A><BR>"Woman, who art thou, and how do these things regard thee? 
<A NAME="319"></A>"
<A NAME="320"></A><BR>And he caused food to be put before her, and he comforted her with 
<A NAME="321"></A>kind words. Then Manijeh said-
<A NAME="322"></A><BR><BR>"I am daughter unto Afrasiyab, and my father hath cast me forth 
<A NAME="323"></A>because of Byzun."
<A NAME="324"></A><BR><BR>And she told him all that was come about, and how she had tended 
<A NAME="325"></A>her beloved, and how she had kept him alive. And she related unto Rustem 
<A NAME="326"></A>how he languished in his chains, and how they put their trust alone in 
<A NAME="327"></A>Rustem the Pehliva. And she said-
<A NAME="328"></A><BR><BR>"When it was told unto me that men from Iran were come forth, I 
<A NAME="329"></A>sped hither unto thee, for I hoped that tidings of Byzun might come thus 
<A NAME="330"></A>unto the mighty warrior."
<A NAME="331"></A><BR><BR>When Rustem heard her words he was moved with compassion. And when 
<A NAME="332"></A>he had spoken softly unto her, he gave to her savoury meats, and he bade 
<A NAME="333"></A>her bear them unto Byzun. Now within the body of a fowl he had hidden a 
<A NAME="334"></A>ring whereon was graven his seal. And when Byzun came upon it, and felt 
<A NAME="335"></A>the ring, and that it bare the name of Rustem, his heart laughed within 
<A NAME="336"></A>him, for he knew that the end of his ills was come. And his lips laughed 
<A NAME="337"></A>also, and his laughter shook the walls of the pit.
<A NAME="338"></A><BR><BR>Now when Manijeh heard his laughter she was amazed, and she feared 
<A NAME="339"></A>lest his wits were distraught, and she leaned over the mouth of the pit 
<A NAME="340"></A>and spake, saying-
<A NAME="341"></A><BR><BR>"O man of ill fortune, wherefore is thy heart thus light, thou 
<A NAME="342"></A>who seest neither sun, nor moon, nor stars?"
<A NAME="343"></A><BR><BR>Then Byzun answered and said, "Hope is sprung up in my 
<A NAME="344"></A>breast."
<A NAME="345"></A><BR>And Manijeh said, "Whence dost thou behold the rays of 
<A NAME="346"></A>hope?"
<A NAME="347"></A><BR>And Byzun answered, "I know not whether I can confide it unto thee, 
<A NAME="348"></A>for a woman cannot keep a secret."
<A NAME="349"></A><BR><BR>Now Manijeh was pained at these words, and she upbraided Byzun, 
<A NAME="350"></A>and recalled to him all she had suffered for his sake. And Byzun repented 
<A NAME="351"></A>him of his hasty speech, for he knew that she was prudent and strong of 
<A NAME="352"></A>spirit. So he said-
<A NAME="353"></A><BR><BR>"Swear unto me a great oath, and I will tell it unto 
<A NAME="354"></A>thee."
<A NAME="355"></A><BR>And Manijeh sware. Then Byzun said-
<A NAME="356"></A><BR>"I know that the merchant who is come forth from Iran is come out because 
<A NAME="357"></A>of me. Go therefore again into his presence, and say unto him, 'O Pehliva 
<A NAME="358"></A>of the King of kings, tell unto me, art thou the master of Rakush?' 
<A NAME="359"></A>"
<A NAME="360"></A><BR><BR>Now Manijeh, when she had heard these words, sped forth to do the 
<A NAME="361"></A>bidding of Byzun. And she came before Rustem, and spake to him the words 
<A NAME="362"></A>that had been told her. And he answered and said-
<A NAME="363"></A><BR><BR>"Go say unto thy friend, verily I am the master of Rakush, and 
<A NAME="364"></A>that I am come forth to deliver him."
<A NAME="365"></A><BR><BR>Then he bade her gather together wood into a pyre, and set light 
<A NAME="366"></A>thereto when the night should be come, that he might know where Byzun was 
<A NAME="367"></A>laid. And Manijeh did as Rustem commanded, and she wearied not to scour 
<A NAME="368"></A>the land, and she stripped the trees of their branches, and her tender 
<A NAME="369"></A>body was torn of thorns; but she bare all gladly for the sake of Byzun, 
<A NAME="370"></A>whom she loved. And when the night was fallen she set light unto the wood, 
<A NAME="371"></A>and Rustem came forth unto the spot, and his seven comrades came with him. 
<A NAME="372"></A>And each strove in turn to lift the stone that closed the pit, but none 
<A NAME="373"></A>could roll it aside. Then Rustem prayed to God that He would grant him 
<A NAME="374"></A>strength, and he came unto the mouth of the pit, and he bent down his body, 
<A NAME="375"></A>and he spake unto Byzun, and questioned him how he was come into these 
<A NAME="376"></A>straits. Then he said-
<A NAME="377"></A><BR><BR>"I would ask of thee a boon. Grant thy forgiveness unto Girgin, 
<A NAME="378"></A>if it be given unto me to move this stone, and to free thee from out of 
<A NAME="379"></A>this pit. For verily he repenteth him of his evil deed, and because he 
<A NAME="380"></A>is valiant I would that there should be peace between 
<A NAME="381"></A>you."
<A NAME="382"></A><BR><BR>But Byzun said, "Thou knowest not all the evil that Girgin hath 
<A NAME="383"></A>brought upon me. I cannot give ear unto thy request, for I desire to take 
<A NAME="384"></A>vengeance upon him."
<A NAME="385"></A><BR><BR>Then Rustem said, "If thy mind be thus evil that thou wilt not 
<A NAME="386"></A>listen to my desires, nor remember how I am come forth in friendship to 
<A NAME="387"></A>succour thee, I shall mount upon Rakush and leave thee to perish in thy 
<A NAME="388"></A>chains."
<A NAME="389"></A><BR><BR>When Byzun heard these words he gave a loud cry, and bewailed his 
<A NAME="390"></A>evil plight. And he said, "Be it as thou desirest."
<A NAME="391"></A><BR><BR>Then Rustem laid hold of the stone, and he put forth all his strength, 
<A NAME="392"></A>and he lifted it from off the mouth of the pit and threw it far into the 
<A NAME="393"></A>desert. Then he let down his cord and enmeshed Byzun therein, and drew 
<A NAME="394"></A>him forth from his dungeon. And he was a sorry sight to see, for the earth 
<A NAME="395"></A>had withered his body, and his skin hung about his bones.
<A NAME="396"></A><BR><BR>Now Rustem, when he had broken the chains of Byzun, covered him 
<A NAME="397"></A>with a cloak and set him upon a horse, and he took Manijeh also, and led 
<A NAME="398"></A>them unto his house in the city. Then when he had refreshed them with water, 
<A NAME="399"></A>and covered them with new robes, he desired that they be led unto the spot 
<A NAME="400"></A>where the army was hidden. And he said unto Byzun-
<A NAME="401"></A><BR><BR>"I desire to fall upon Turan, but thou art too wasted to 
<A NAME="402"></A>fight."
<A NAME="403"></A><BR>But Byzun said, "Not so; let Manijeh go forth into shelter, but it 
<A NAME="404"></A>behoveth not a man to be guarded like a woman."
<A NAME="405"></A><BR><BR>And he refused ear to the desires of Rustem, and he clad him in 
<A NAME="406"></A>a coat of mail, and he girded him to ride beside the Pehliva. And they 
<A NAME="407"></A>went forth in the darkness until they were come unto the house of Afrasiyab. 
<A NAME="408"></A>And when they were come there, Rustem lifted the doors from off their hinges 
<A NAME="409"></A>and entered into the precincts, and he slew the guards that kept the curtains, 
<A NAME="410"></A>and he made him a passage unto the chamber of Afrasiyab. And when he stood 
<A NAME="411"></A>therein he lifted up his voice of thunder, and he cried-
<A NAME="412"></A><BR><BR>"Sleep, man of folly, and may thy slumbers be deep. Thou hast rested 
<A NAME="413"></A>upon thy throne while Byzun was hidden in a pit. But thou hast forgotten 
<A NAME="414"></A>that a road leadeth from Iran into Turan, and thou didst think in thine 
<A NAME="415"></A>evil heart that none would come forth to avenge him. Listen, therefore, 
<A NAME="416"></A>unto my voice; for I am Rustem, the son of Zal, the Pehliva, and I have 
<A NAME="417"></A>broken down thy doors, and released Byzun from his chains, and I am come 
<A NAME="418"></A>to do vengeance upon thee."
<A NAME="419"></A><BR><BR>When Afrasiyab heard these words he awoke, and cried out in his 
<A NAME="420"></A>fear. And he called upon the names of his guards. But no man came forth, 
<A NAME="421"></A>because they had been laid low by the hands of Rustem. Then Afrasiyab made 
<A NAME="422"></A>his way unto the door, and because it was dark he escaped thence, and he 
<A NAME="423"></A>fled before the face of Rustem, and left his house between his hands. Then 
<A NAME="424"></A>Rustem took much rich booty of slaves, and horses, and jewels, and when 
<A NAME="425"></A>he had done so he sped back unto his army, for he knew that with the day 
<A NAME="426"></A>Afrasiyab would come forth with an host to assail him. And it came about 
<A NAME="427"></A>as he foresaw, and when the day was risen the watchers cried out that an 
<A NAME="428"></A>army marched forth from Turan. Then Rustem set his men in battle order, 
<A NAME="429"></A>and he sent Manijeh and the slaves and the booty into Iran, and he placed 
<A NAME="430"></A>himself at the head of the host, and Byzun rode beside him. And there was 
<A NAME="431"></A>fought a mighty battle, and great was the slaughter, and the bodies of 
<A NAME="432"></A>the slain and the broken armour covered the earth. And the banner of Turan 
<A NAME="433"></A>sank, and Afrasiyab fled before his enemies.
<A NAME="434"></A><BR><BR>Then Rustem returned with joy unto Kai Khosrau, and the Shah was 
<A NAME="435"></A>glad also. And he came forth to greet his Pehliva, and there rode with 
<A NAME="436"></A>him Gew and Gudarz, his warriors. And when Kai Khosrau saw Rustem he embraced 
<A NAME="437"></A>him, and said-
<A NAME="438"></A><BR><BR>"O stay of my soul, and man of valour, thou resemblest the sun, 
<A NAME="439"></A>for wheresoever men may look they behold the traces of thy mighty deeds. 
<A NAME="440"></A>Happy is Zal who owneth a son such as thou!"
<A NAME="441"></A><BR><BR>Then he blessed him, and showered rich gifts upon him; and Gew 
<A NAME="442"></A>blessed him also, and Gudarz, because he had brought back Byzun into their 
<A NAME="443"></A>midst. Then Kai Khosrau gave orders that a great feast be prepared, and 
<A NAME="444"></A>the heroes drank until their heads were heavy with wine. But in the morning 
<A NAME="445"></A>Rustem came before the Shah in audience, and opened his mouth and 
<A NAME="446"></A>said-
<A NAME="447"></A><BR><BR>"May it please the King to lend his ear unto his slave. I desire 
<A NAME="448"></A>to return unto Zal, my father."
<A NAME="449"></A><BR><BR>And Kai Khosrau listened to the just desires of Rustem, though 
<A NAME="450"></A>he would fain have kept him in his courts.
<A NAME="451"></A><BR><BR>Now when Rustem was departed, Kai Khosrau called before him Byzun, 
<A NAME="452"></A>and he spake to him of that which was come about, and he poured pity upon 
<A NAME="453"></A>the daughter of Afrasiyab when he learned all she had suffered for the 
<A NAME="454"></A>sake of Byzun; and he gave him rich gifts, and bade him bear them unto 
<A NAME="455"></A>her, and he said-
<A NAME="456"></A><BR><BR>"Cherish this woman in thy bosom, and suffer not that grief come 
<A NAME="457"></A>nigh unto her, neither speak to her cold words, for she hath endured much 
<A NAME="458"></A>for thee. And may thy life beside her be happy."
<A NAME="459"></A><BR><BR>And when the Shah had thus spoken he dismissed Byzun from his 
<A NAME="460"></A>presence.
<A NAME="461"></A><BR><BR>Thus endeth the history of Byzun and Manijeh.
