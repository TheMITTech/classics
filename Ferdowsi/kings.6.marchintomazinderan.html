<A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A>Kai aous seated him on the crystal throne, and the world was obedient to 
<A NAME="11"></A>his will. But Ahriman was angry that his power was so long broken in Iran, 
<A NAME="12"></A>and he sware unto himself that happiness should no longer smile upon the 
<A NAME="13"></A>land. And he imagined guile in his black heart.
<A NAME="14"></A><BR><BR>Now it came about one day that the Shah sat in his trellised bower 
<A NAME="15"></A>in the garden of roses, drinking wine and making merry with his court. 
<A NAME="16"></A>Then Ahriman, when he beheld that they were thus forgetful of care, saw 
<A NAME="17"></A>that the time served him. So he sent forth a Deev clad as a singer, and 
<A NAME="18"></A>bade him ask for audience before the Shah. And the Deev did as he was bidden. 
<A NAME="19"></A>And he came before the servants of the King, and begged for entrance into 
<A NAME="20"></A>the arbour of flowers.
<A NAME="21"></A><BR><BR>"For verily," he said, "I am a singer of sweet songs, and I come 
<A NAME="22"></A>from Mazinderan, and desire to pour my homage at the throne of my 
<A NAME="23"></A>lord."
<A NAME="24"></A><BR><BR>Now when Kai Kaous learned that a singer waited without, he commanded 
<A NAME="25"></A>that he should be brought in. Then he gave him wine and permitted him to 
<A NAME="26"></A>open his mouth before him. Now the Deev, when he had done homage before 
<A NAME="27"></A>the Shah, warbled unto his lyre words of deep cunning. And he sang how 
<A NAME="28"></A>that no land was like unto his own for beauty and riches, and he inflamed 
<A NAME="29"></A>the desires of the Shah after Mazinderan. And Ahriman fanned the flame 
<A NAME="30"></A>within the mind of the King, and when the Deev had ended, Kai Kaous was 
<A NAME="31"></A>become uplifted in his heart, like unto Jemshid. So he turned him unto 
<A NAME="32"></A>his warriors and said-
<A NAME="33"></A><BR><BR>"O my friends, mighty and brave, we have abandoned ourselves unto 
<A NAME="34"></A>feasting, we have revelled in the arms of peace. But it behoveth not men 
<A NAME="35"></A>to live long in this wise, lest they grow idle and weak. And above all 
<A NAME="36"></A>it behoveth not me that am a Shah, for the Shah is called to be a hero 
<A NAME="37"></A>among men, and the world should be his footstool. Now verily the power 
<A NAME="38"></A>and splendour of Jemshid was lower than mine, and my wealth surpasseth 
<A NAME="39"></A>that of Zohak and Kai Kobad. It beseemeth me therefore to be greater also 
<A NAME="40"></A>than they in prowess, and to be master of Mazinderan, which ever resisted 
<A NAME="41"></A>their might. I bid you therefore make ready for combat, and I will lead 
<A NAME="42"></A>you into the land whereof this singer hath sung so sweetly."
<A NAME="43"></A><BR><BR>Now the nobles, when they had heard these words, grew pale with 
<A NAME="44"></A>fear, for there was not one among them who listed to combat with Deevs. 
<A NAME="45"></A>But none durst open their lips in answer, yet their hearts were full of 
<A NAME="46"></A>fear and their mouths of sighs. But at last, when they could keep silence 
<A NAME="47"></A>no longer, some spake and said-
<A NAME="48"></A><BR><BR>"Lord, we are thy servants, and that which thou biddest surely 
<A NAME="49"></A>we must do."
<A NAME="50"></A><BR><BR>But among themselves they took counsel how they should act if the 
<A NAME="51"></A>Shah held firm by his desire. And they recalled how not even Jemshid in 
<A NAME="52"></A>his pride had thought to conquer the Deevs of Mazinderan, before whom the 
<A NAME="53"></A>sword hath no power and wisdom no avail, neither had Feridoun, learned 
<A NAME="54"></A>in magic, or Minuchihr the mighty, ventured on this emprise. Then they 
<A NAME="55"></A>bethought them of Zal the son of Saum, and they sent forth a wind-footed 
<A NAME="56"></A>dromedary and a messenger. And they said unto Zal-
<A NAME="57"></A><BR><BR>"Haste, we pray thee, neither tarry to cleanse thine head though 
<A NAME="58"></A>it be covered with dust; for Ahriman hath strown evil seed in the heart 
<A NAME="59"></A>of Kai Kaous, and it ripeneth to fruit already, and already it hath borne 
<A NAME="60"></A>fruit, and Iran is threatened with danger. But we look to thee that thou 
<A NAME="61"></A>speak words of good counsel unto the Shah, and avert these sorrows from 
<A NAME="62"></A>our heads."
<A NAME="63"></A><BR><BR>Now Zal was sore distressed when he learned that a leaf on the 
<A NAME="64"></A>tree of the Kaianides was thus faded. And he said-
<A NAME="65"></A><BR><BR>"Kai Kaous is void of knowledge, and the sun must revolve yet oft 
<A NAME="66"></A>above his head before he learneth the wisdom of the great. For unto true 
<A NAME="67"></A>wisdom alone is it given to know when to strike and when to tarry. But 
<A NAME="68"></A>he is like unto a child who deemeth the world will tremble if it but upraiseth 
<A NAME="69"></A>its sword. And but for my duty unto God and unto Iran, I would abandon 
<A NAME="70"></A>him to his folly."
<A NAME="71"></A><BR><BR>Then Zal revolved in his mind this trouble even until the sun was 
<A NAME="72"></A>set. But when the glory of the world was arisen yet again, he girt his 
<A NAME="73"></A>sash about his loins, and took in his hand the mace of might and set forth 
<A NAME="74"></A>unto the throne of the Shah. And he craved for audience, and prostrated 
<A NAME="75"></A>himself before the King. And when Kai Kaous permitted it, Zal opened his 
<A NAME="76"></A>mouth and spake words of wisdom. And he said-
<A NAME="77"></A><BR><BR>"O King powerful and great, word is come unto me, even unto Seistan, 
<A NAME="78"></A>of thy device. But it seemeth unto me that mine ears have not heard aright. 
<A NAME="79"></A>For Mazinderan is the abode of Deevs, and no man can overcome their skill. 
<A NAME="80"></A>Give not, therefore, unto the wind thy men and thy treasures. Turn, I pray 
<A NAME="81"></A>thee, from this scheme, neither plant in the garden of Iran the tree of 
<A NAME="82"></A>folly, whose leaves are curses and whose fruits are evil, for thus did 
<A NAME="83"></A>not the kings before thee."
<A NAME="84"></A><BR><BR>Then Kai Kaous, when he had listened, said, "I despise not thy 
<A NAME="85"></A>counsel, nor do I bid thee hold thy peace, for thou art a pillar unto Iran. 
<A NAME="86"></A>But neither shall thy words divert me from my desire, and Mazinderan shall 
<A NAME="87"></A>pay tribute to my hands. For thou considerest not how that my heart is 
<A NAME="88"></A>bolder and my might more great than that of my fathers before me. I go, 
<A NAME="89"></A>therefore, and the kingdom will I leave between thy hands and those of 
<A NAME="90"></A>Rustem thy son."
<A NAME="91"></A><BR><BR>When Zal heard these words, and beheld that Kai Kaous was firm 
<A NAME="92"></A>in his purpose, he ceased from opposing. Then he bowed him unto the dust, 
<A NAME="93"></A>and spake, saying-
<A NAME="94"></A><BR><BR>"O Shah, it is thine to command, and whether it be just or unjust, 
<A NAME="95"></A>thy servants serve thee even unto death. I have spoken the words that weighed 
<A NAME="96"></A>upon my heart. Three things it is not given to do, even unto a king: to 
<A NAME="97"></A>elude death, to bind up the eye of destiny, to live without nurture. Mayst 
<A NAME="98"></A>thou never repent thee of thy resolve, mayst thou never regret my counsels 
<A NAME="99"></A>in the hour of danger, may the might of the Shah shine for 
<A NAME="100"></A>ever!"
<A NAME="101"></A><BR><BR>And when he had ended, Zal went out of the presence of the King, 
<A NAME="102"></A>and he was right sorrowful, and the nobles mourned with him when they learned 
<A NAME="103"></A>how nought had been accomplished.
<A NAME="104"></A><BR><BR>Then, ere the day succeeded unto the night, Kai Kaous set forth 
<A NAME="105"></A>with his horsemen unto Mazinderan.
<A NAME="106"></A><BR><BR>Now when they were come within its borders, Kai Kaous commanded 
<A NAME="107"></A>Gew that he should choose forth a strong band from out their midst, and 
<A NAME="108"></A>go before the city with mighty clubs. And he bade him destroy the dwellers 
<A NAME="109"></A>of the town, neither should they spare the women nor the young, because 
<A NAME="110"></A>that they too were the children of Deevs. And Gew did as the Shah commanded. 
<A NAME="111"></A>Then clubs rained down upon the people like to hail, and the city that 
<A NAME="112"></A>resembled a garden was changed into a desert, and all the inmates thereof 
<A NAME="113"></A>perished at the hands of the enemy, neither did they find any mercy in 
<A NAME="114"></A>their eyes. But when the men of Iran had ceased from killing, they sent 
<A NAME="115"></A>news thereof unto the Shah, and told him of the riches that were hidden 
<A NAME="116"></A>within the palaces.
<A NAME="117"></A><BR><BR>And Kai Kaous said, "Blessed be he who sang to me of the glories 
<A NAME="118"></A>of this realm."
<A NAME="119"></A><BR><BR>And he marched after Gew with the rest of his host, and seven days 
<A NAME="120"></A>did they never cease from plundering, neither could they be sated with 
<A NAME="121"></A>the gold and jewels that they found. But on the eighth the tidings of their 
<A NAME="122"></A>deeds pierced unto the King of Mazinderan, and his heart was heavy with 
<A NAME="123"></A>care. He therefore sent a messenger unto the mountains where dwelt the 
<A NAME="124"></A>White Deev, who was powerful and strong, and he entreated him that he would 
<A NAME="125"></A>come unto his succour, or verily the land would perish under the feet of 
<A NAME="126"></A>Iran.
<A NAME="127"></A><BR><BR>The White Deev, when he heard the message, uprose like to a mountain 
<A NAME="128"></A>in his strength, and he said-
<A NAME="129"></A><BR><BR>"Let not the King of Mazinderan be troubled, for surely the hosts 
<A NAME="130"></A>of Iran shall vanish at my approach."
<A NAME="131"></A><BR><BR>Then, when the night was fallen, he spread a dark cloud, heavy 
<A NAME="132"></A>and thick, over the land, and no light could pierce it, neither could fires 
<A NAME="133"></A>be seen across its midst, and you would have said the world was steeped 
<A NAME="134"></A>in pitch. And the army of Iran was wrapt in a tent of blackness. Then the 
<A NAME="135"></A>Deev caused it to rain stones and javelins, and the Iranians could not 
<A NAME="136"></A>behold their source, neither could they defend themselves or stand against 
<A NAME="137"></A>the arts of magic. And they wandered astray in their distress, and no man 
<A NAME="138"></A>could find his fellow, and their hearts were angered against the Shah for 
<A NAME="139"></A>this emprise. But when the morning was come, and glory was arisen upon 
<A NAME="140"></A>the world, they could not see it, for the light of their eyes was gone 
<A NAME="141"></A>out. And Kai Kaous too was blinded, and he wept sore, and the whole army 
<A NAME="142"></A>wept with him in their anguish. And the Shah cried in his 
<A NAME="143"></A>distress-
<A NAME="144"></A><BR><BR>"O Zal, O my Pehliva wise and great, wherefore did I shut mine 
<A NAME="145"></A>ear unto thy voice!"
<A NAME="146"></A><BR><BR>And the army echoed his words in their hearts, but their lips were 
<A NAME="147"></A>silent for boundless sorrow.
<A NAME="148"></A><BR><BR>Then the White Deev spake unto Kai Kaous with a voice of thunder, 
<A NAME="149"></A>and he said-
<A NAME="150"></A><BR><BR>"O King, thou hast been struck like to a rotten trunk, on thine 
<A NAME="151"></A>own head alone resteth this destruction, for thou hast attained unto Mazinderan, 
<A NAME="152"></A>and entered the land after which thy heart desired."
<A NAME="153"></A><BR><BR>And he bade his legion guard the Shah and all his army, and he 
<A NAME="154"></A>withheld from them wine and good cheer, and gave unto them but enough for 
<A NAME="155"></A>sustenance, for he desired not that they should die, but gloried in their 
<A NAME="156"></A>wretchedness. Then when he had so done he sent tidings thereof unto the 
<A NAME="157"></A>King of Mazinderan. And he bade the King take back the booty and rejoice 
<A NAME="158"></A>in the defeat of Iran. And he counselled him that he suffer not Kai Kaous 
<A NAME="159"></A>to perish, that he might learn to know good fortune from ill. And the White 
<A NAME="160"></A>Deev bade the King sing praises unto Ahriman the mighty, who had sent him 
<A NAME="161"></A>unto his aid. And having spoken thus he returned him unto his home in the 
<A NAME="162"></A>mountains, but the King of Mazinderan rejoiced in his 
<A NAME="163"></A>spoils.
<A NAME="164"></A><BR><BR>Now Kai Kaous remained in the land after which he had yearned, 
<A NAME="165"></A>and his heart was heavy with bitterness. And the eyes of his soul were 
<A NAME="166"></A>opened, and he cried continually, "This fault is mine;" and he cast about 
<A NAME="167"></A>in his spirit how he might release his host from the hands of the Deevs. 
<A NAME="168"></A>But the Deevs guarded him straitly, and he could send no messenger into 
<A NAME="169"></A>Iran. Howbeit it came about that a messenger escaped their borders, and 
<A NAME="170"></A>bore unto Zal the writing of Kai Kaous the afflicted. And Kai Kaous bowed 
<A NAME="171"></A>himself in his spirit unto the dust before Zal, and he wrote to him all 
<A NAME="172"></A>that was come about, and how that he and his host were blind and captive, 
<A NAME="173"></A>and he poured forth his repentance, and he said-
<A NAME="174"></A><BR><BR>"I have sought what the foolish seek, and found what they find. 
<A NAME="175"></A>And if thou wilt not gird thy loins to succour me, I perish 
<A NAME="176"></A>indeed."
<A NAME="177"></A><BR><BR>When Zal heard this message he gnawed his hands in vexation. Then 
<A NAME="178"></A>he called before him Rustem, and said-
<A NAME="179"></A><BR><BR>"The hour is come to saddle Rakush and to avenge the world with 
<A NAME="180"></A>thy sword. As for me, I number two hundred years, and have no longer the 
<A NAME="181"></A>strength to fight with Deevs. But thou art young and mighty. Cast about 
<A NAME="182"></A>thee, therefore, thy leopard-skin and deliver Iran from 
<A NAME="183"></A>bondage."
<A NAME="184"></A><BR><BR>And Rustem said, "My sword is ready, and I will go hence as thou 
<A NAME="185"></A>dost bid. Yet of old, O my father, the mighty did not go forth of their 
<A NAME="186"></A>own will to fight the powers of hell, neither doth one who is not weary 
<A NAME="187"></A>of this world go into the mouth of a hungry lion. But if God be with me 
<A NAME="188"></A>I shall overcome the Deevs and gird our army anew with the sashes of might. 
<A NAME="189"></A>And I pray that His blessing rest upon me."
<A NAME="190"></A><BR><BR>Then Zal, when he heard these noble words, blessed his son, and 
<A NAME="191"></A>prayed that Ormuzd too would give him his blessing. And he bestowed on 
<A NAME="192"></A>him wise counsel, and told him how he could come unto the land of Mazinderan. 
<A NAME="193"></A>And he said-
<A NAME="194"></A><BR><BR>"Two roads lead unto this kingdom, and both are hard and fraught 
<A NAME="195"></A>with danger. The one taken of Kai Kaous is the safest, but it is long, 
<A NAME="196"></A>and it behoveth vengeance to be fleet. Choose therefore, I charge thee, 
<A NAME="197"></A>the shorter road, though it be beset with baleful things, and may Ormuzd 
<A NAME="198"></A>return thee safe unto mine arms."
<A NAME="199"></A><BR><BR>When Rustem had drunk in the counsels of his father he seated him 
<A NAME="200"></A>on Rakush the fleet of foot. But when he would have departed, his mother 
<A NAME="201"></A>came out before him, and she made great wailing that Rustem should go before 
<A NAME="202"></A>the evil Deevs. And she would have hindered him, but Rustem suffered her 
<A NAME="203"></A>not. He comforted her with his voice, and bade her be of good cheer. He 
<A NAME="204"></A>showed unto her how that he had not of his own choice chosen this adventure. 
<A NAME="205"></A>And he bade her rest her hopes in God. And when he had done speaking she 
<A NAME="206"></A>let him depart, but the heart of Rudabeh yearned after her son, and her 
<A NAME="207"></A>eyes were red with weeping many days.
<A NAME="208"></A><BR><BR>In the meanwhile the young hero of the world sped forth to do his 
<A NAME="209"></A>duty unto the Shah. And Rakush caused the ground to vanish under his feet, 
<A NAME="210"></A>and in twelve hours was a two days' journey accomplished. Then when eve 
<A NAME="211"></A>was fallen, Rustem ensnared a wild ass, and made a fire and roasted it 
<A NAME="212"></A>for his meal. And when he had done he released Rakush from the bonds of 
<A NAME="213"></A>his saddle and prepared for himself a couch among the reeds, neither was 
<A NAME="214"></A>he afraid of wild beasts or of Deevs.
<A NAME="215"></A><BR><BR>But in the reeds was hidden the lair of a fierce lion, and the 
<A NAME="216"></A>lion when he returned unto his haunt beheld the tall man and the horse 
<A NAME="217"></A>that watched beside him. And he rejoiced at the fat meal that he held was 
<A NAME="218"></A>in store. And he thought within his mind, "I will first subdue the steed, 
<A NAME="219"></A>then the rider will be an easy prey." And he fell upon Rakush. But Rakush 
<A NAME="220"></A>defended himself mightily. With his hoofs did he trample upon the forehead 
<A NAME="221"></A>of the lion, with his sharp teeth did he tear his skin, and he trampled 
<A NAME="222"></A>upon him till he died. But the noise of the struggle had wakened Rustem, 
<A NAME="223"></A>and when he beheld the body of the lion, and Rakush standing beside it, 
<A NAME="224"></A>he knew what had been done. Then he opened his mouth in reproof, and 
<A NAME="225"></A>said-
<A NAME="226"></A><BR><BR>"O thoughtless steed, who bade thee combat lions? Wherefore didst 
<A NAME="227"></A>thou not wake me? for if thou hadst been overcome, who, I pray thee, could 
<A NAME="228"></A>have borne my weight into Mazinderan, whither I must hie me to deliver 
<A NAME="229"></A>the Shah?
<A NAME="230"></A><BR><BR>When he had thus spoken he turned again to sleep, but Rakush was 
<A NAME="231"></A>sorrowful and downcast in his spirit.
<A NAME="232"></A><BR><BR>Now when morn was come they set forth once again upon their travels. 
<A NAME="233"></A>And all day long they passed through a desert, and the pitiless sun burned 
<A NAME="234"></A>down upon their heads, and the sand was living fire, and the steed and 
<A NAME="235"></A>rider were like to perish of thirst, and nowhere could Rustem find the 
<A NAME="236"></A>traces of water. So he made him ready to die, and commended his soul unto 
<A NAME="237"></A>God, and prayed Him to remember Kai Kaous, His servant, nor abandon him 
<A NAME="238"></A>in his distress. Then he laid him down to await the end. But lo! when he 
<A NAME="239"></A>thought it was come, there passed before him a ram, well nourished and 
<A NAME="240"></A>fat. And Rustem said unto himself-
<A NAME="241"></A><BR><BR>"Surely the watering-place of this beast cannot be 
<A NAME="242"></A>distant."
<A NAME="243"></A><BR>Then he roused him and led Rakush and followed in the footsteps of 
<A NAME="244"></A>the ram, and behold, it led him unto a spring of water, cool and clear. 
<A NAME="245"></A>And Rustem drank thereof with greed, and he gave unto Rakush, and bathed 
<A NAME="246"></A>him in the waters, and when they were both refreshed he sought for the 
<A NAME="247"></A>traces of the ram. And they were nowhere to be found. Then Rustem knew 
<A NAME="248"></A>that Ormuzd had wrought a wonder for his sake, and he fell upon the ground 
<A NAME="249"></A>and lifted up his soul in thankfulness. Then when he had caught and eaten 
<A NAME="250"></A>a wild ass, he laid him down to slumber. And he spake and said unto 
<A NAME="251"></A>Rakush-
<A NAME="252"></A><BR><BR>"I charge thee, O my steed, that thou seek no strife during my 
<A NAME="253"></A>slumbers. If an enemy cometh before thee, come unto me and neigh beside 
<A NAME="254"></A>mine ear, and verily I will waken and come to thine 
<A NAME="255"></A>aid."
<A NAME="256"></A><BR><BR>And Rakush listened, and when he saw that Rustem slumbered, he 
<A NAME="257"></A>gambolled and grazed beside him. But when some watches of the night were 
<A NAME="258"></A>spent, there came forth an angry dragon whose home was in this spot, a 
<A NAME="259"></A>dragon fierce and fiery, whom even the Deevs dared not encounter. And when 
<A NAME="260"></A>he beheld Rakush and Rustem he was astonished that a man should slumber 
<A NAME="261"></A>softly beside his lair. And he came towards them with his breath of poison. 
<A NAME="262"></A>Then Rakush, when he saw it, stamped his hoofs upon the ground and beat 
<A NAME="263"></A>the air with his tail, so that the noise thereof resounded wide, and Rustem 
<A NAME="264"></A>was awakened with the din. And he was angry with Rakush that he had wakened 
<A NAME="265"></A>him, for the dragon had vanished, and he could see no cause for fear. And 
<A NAME="266"></A>he said-
<A NAME="267"></A><BR><BR>"It is thy fault, O unkind steed, that slumber is fled from 
<A NAME="268"></A>me."
<A NAME="269"></A><BR>Then he turned him to sleep once again. But when the dragon saw it 
<A NAME="270"></A>he came forth once more, and once more did Rakush wake Rustem, and once 
<A NAME="271"></A>more did the dragon vanish ere the eyes of Rustem were opened. And when 
<A NAME="272"></A>Rakush had thus awakened the hero yet three times, Rustem was beside him 
<A NAME="273"></A>with anger, and wisdom departed from its dwelling. He piled reproaches 
<A NAME="274"></A>upon the horse, and hurled bitter words upon his head, and he sware that 
<A NAME="275"></A>if he acted thus again he would slay him with his arm of power, and would 
<A NAME="276"></A>wander on foot unto Mazinderan. And he said-
<A NAME="277"></A><BR><BR>"I bade thee call upon me if dangers menaced, but thou sufferest 
<A NAME="278"></A>me not to slumber when all is well."
<A NAME="279"></A><BR><BR>Then Rustem drew his leopard-skin about him and laid him down again 
<A NAME="280"></A>to sleep. But Rakush was pained in his spirit, and pawed the ground in 
<A NAME="281"></A>his vexation. Then the dragon came forth yet again, and was about to fall 
<A NAME="282"></A>upon Rakush, and the steed was sore distressed how he should act. But he 
<A NAME="283"></A>took courage and came beside Rustem once more, and stamped upon the ground 
<A NAME="284"></A>and neighed and woke him. And Rustem sprang up in fury, but this time it 
<A NAME="285"></A>was given unto him to behold the dragon, and he knew that Rakush had done 
<A NAME="286"></A>that which was right. And he drew his armour about him and unsheathed his 
<A NAME="287"></A>sword, and came forth to meet the fiery beast. Then the dragon 
<A NAME="288"></A>said-
<A NAME="289"></A><BR><BR>"What is thy name, and who art thou that dost venture against me? 
<A NAME="290"></A>for verily the woman that bore thee shall weep."
<A NAME="291"></A><BR><BR>And the Pehliva answered, "I am Rustem, of the seed of Zal, and 
<A NAME="292"></A>in myself I am an host, and none can withstand my might."
<A NAME="293"></A><BR><BR>But the dragon laughed at his words, and held them to be vain boasting. 
<A NAME="294"></A>Then he fell upon Rustem, the son of Zal, and he wound himself about his 
<A NAME="295"></A>body, and would have crushed him with his writhings, and you would have 
<A NAME="296"></A>said that the end of this hero was come. But Rakush, when he beheld the 
<A NAME="297"></A>straits of his master, sprang upon the dragon from the rear, and he tore 
<A NAME="298"></A>him as he had torn the lion, and Rustem pierced the beast with his sword, 
<A NAME="299"></A>and between them the world was delivered of this scourge. Then Rustem was 
<A NAME="300"></A>glad, and he praised Rakush, and washed him at the fountain, and gave thanks 
<A NAME="301"></A>to God who had given unto him the victory. And when he had so done he sprang 
<A NAME="302"></A>into his saddle, and rode until they were come unto the land of the 
<A NAME="303"></A>magicians.
<A NAME="304"></A><BR><BR>Now when evening was fallen over the land they came unto a green 
<A NAME="305"></A>and shady vale, and a brook ran through it, and cool woods clothed its 
<A NAME="306"></A>sides. And beside a spring there was spread a table, and wine and all manner 
<A NAME="307"></A>of good cheer stood thereon. And Rustem, when he saw it, loosened his saddle 
<A NAME="308"></A>and bade Rakush graze and drink, and he seated him beside the table and 
<A NAME="309"></A>enjoyed its fare. And his spirit laughed with pleasure that he had found 
<A NAME="310"></A>a table ready dressed within the desert, for he knew not that it was the 
<A NAME="311"></A>table of the magicians, who were fled on his approach. And he ate and drank, 
<A NAME="312"></A>and when he had stilled his hunger he took up a lyre that lay beside him, 
<A NAME="313"></A>and he lilted to it in his ease of heart. And he sang-
<A NAME="314"></A><BR><BR><B>"Rustem is the scourge of the base,</B> <B>Not for him were 
<A NAME="315"></A>pleasures meant;</B> <B>Rare are his feasts and holidays,</B> <B>His garden 
<A NAME="316"></A>is the desert place,</B> <B>The battlefield his tournament.</B>
<A NAME="317"></A><BR><BR><B>"There the sword of Rustem cleaves</B> <B>Not the armour of 
<A NAME="318"></A>jousting knights,</B> <B>But the skulls of dragons and Deevs;</B> <B>Nor 
<A NAME="319"></A>shall Rustem, as he believes,</B> <B>Ever be quit of the foes he 
<A NAME="320"></A>fights.</B>
<A NAME="321"></A><BR><BR><B>"Cups of wine and wreaths of rose,</B> <B>Gardens where cool 
<A NAME="322"></A>arbours stand,</B> <B>Fortune gave such gifts as those</B> <B>Not to Rustem, 
<A NAME="323"></A>but hurtling foes,</B> <B>Strife, and a warrior's heart and 
<A NAME="324"></A>hand."</B>
<A NAME="325"></A><BR><BR>Now the song of Rustem was come to the ears of one of the witches, 
<A NAME="326"></A>and she changed herself into a damsel with a face of spring. And she came 
<A NAME="327"></A>before Rustem and asked him his name, and toyed with him, and he was pleased 
<A NAME="328"></A>with her company. And he poured out wine and handed it unto her, and bade 
<A NAME="329"></A>her drink unto Ormuzd. But the magician, when she heard the name of God, 
<A NAME="330"></A>fell into a tremble and her visage changed, and Rustem beheld her in all 
<A NAME="331"></A>her vileness. Then his quick spirit knew her for what she was, and he made 
<A NAME="332"></A>a noose and caught her in his snare, and severed her in twain. And all 
<A NAME="333"></A>the magicians, when they saw it, were afraid, and none durst come forth 
<A NAME="334"></A>to meet the hero. But Rustem straightway departed from this 
<A NAME="335"></A>spot.
<A NAME="336"></A><BR><BR>And Rustem rode till that he was come unto a land where the sun 
<A NAME="337"></A>never shineth, neither stars lighten the blackness, and he could not see 
<A NAME="338"></A>his path. So he suffered Rakush to lead him at his will. And they stumbled 
<A NAME="339"></A>along amid the blackness, but at the end they came out again into the light. 
<A NAME="340"></A>And Rustem beheld a land that was swathed in verdure, and fields wherein 
<A NAME="341"></A>the crops were sprouting. Then he loosened Rakush and bade him graze, and 
<A NAME="342"></A>laid himself down to slumber awhile.
<A NAME="343"></A><BR><BR>Now Rakush went forth to graze in a field that had been sown, and 
<A NAME="344"></A>the guardian thereof, when he saw it, was angry, and ran unto the spot 
<A NAME="345"></A>where Rustem was couched, and beat the soles of his feet with a stick and 
<A NAME="346"></A>woke him. And he flung reproaches and evil words upon him for that his 
<A NAME="347"></A>horse was broken into the pastures. Then Rustem was angry, and fell upon 
<A NAME="348"></A>the man, and took him by the ears and tore them from his body. And the 
<A NAME="349"></A>man fled, howling in his agony, and came before Aulad, the ruler of the 
<A NAME="350"></A>land, and laid his plaints before him. And Aulad also was angry, and went 
<A NAME="351"></A>forth to seek Rustem, and demand his name and mission, and wherefore he 
<A NAME="352"></A>had thus disturbed their peace. And Aulad sware that he would destroy him 
<A NAME="353"></A>for this deed.
<A NAME="354"></A><BR><BR>Then Rustem answered, "I am the thunder-cloud that sendeth forth 
<A NAME="355"></A>lightnings, and none can stand before my strength. But if thou shouldest 
<A NAME="356"></A>hear my name, the blood would stand still within thy veins. Thou art come 
<A NAME="357"></A>against me with an host, see therefore how I shall scatter them like the 
<A NAME="358"></A>wind."
<A NAME="359"></A><BR><BR>And when he had thus spoken, Rustem fell upon the warriors of Aulad, 
<A NAME="360"></A>and he beat them down before him, and their heads fell under the blows 
<A NAME="361"></A>of his sword of death. And the army was routed at the hands of one man. 
<A NAME="362"></A>Now Aulad, when he saw it, wept and fled; but Rustem pursued him, and threw 
<A NAME="363"></A>his noose about him, and caught him in the snare. And the world became 
<A NAME="364"></A>dark unto Aulad. Then Rustem bound him, and threw him on the ground, and 
<A NAME="365"></A>said-
<A NAME="366"></A><BR><BR>"If thou speak unto me that which is true, verily I will release 
<A NAME="367"></A>thee; and when I shall have overcome the Deevs, I will give the land of 
<A NAME="368"></A>Mazinderan into thy hands. Tell me, therefore, where dwelleth the White 
<A NAME="369"></A>Deev, and where may I find the Shah and his men, and how can I deliver 
<A NAME="370"></A>them from bondage?"
<A NAME="371"></A><BR><BR>Then Aulad answered and told Rustem how it was an hundred farsangs 
<A NAME="372"></A>unto the spot where Kai Kaous groaned in his bondage, and how it was yet 
<A NAME="373"></A>another hundred unto the mountain pass where dwelt the Deev. And he told 
<A NAME="374"></A>him how the passes were guarded by lions and magicians and mighty men, 
<A NAME="375"></A>and how none had ever pierced thereunto. And he counselled him to desist 
<A NAME="376"></A>from this quest.
<A NAME="377"></A><BR><BR>But Rustem smiled, and said, "Be thou my guide, and thou wilt behold 
<A NAME="378"></A>an elephant overcome the might of evil."
<A NAME="379"></A><BR><BR>And when he had thus spoken he sprang upon Rakush, and Aulad in 
<A NAME="380"></A>his bonds ran after him, and they sped like the wind, neither did they 
<A NAME="381"></A>halt by night or day till they were come unto the spot where Kai Kaous 
<A NAME="382"></A>had been smitten by the Deevs. And when they were come there they could 
<A NAME="383"></A>behold the watch-fires of Mazinderan. Then Rustem laid him down to sleep, 
<A NAME="384"></A>and he tied Aulad unto a tree that he should not escape him. But when the 
<A NAME="385"></A>sun was risen he laid the mace of Saum before his saddle, and rode with 
<A NAME="386"></A>gladness towards the city of the Deevs.
<A NAME="387"></A><BR><BR>Now when Rustem was come nigh unto the tents of Arzang, that led 
<A NAME="388"></A>the army of Mazinderan, he uttered a cry that rent the mountains. And the 
<A NAME="389"></A>cry brought forth Arzang from out his tent, and when he perceived Rustem 
<A NAME="390"></A>he ran at him, and would have thrown him down. But Rustem sprang upon Arzang, 
<A NAME="391"></A>and he seemed an insect in his grasp. And he overcame him, and parted his 
<A NAME="392"></A>head from his body, and hung it upon his saddlebow in triumph. And fear 
<A NAME="393"></A>came upon the army of Mazinderan when they saw it, and they fled in faintness 
<A NAME="394"></A>of spirit, and so great was the confusion that none beheld whither he bent 
<A NAME="395"></A>his steps. And fathers fell upon sons, and brothers upon brothers, and 
<A NAME="396"></A>dismay was spread throughout the land.
<A NAME="397"></A><BR><BR>Then Rustem loosened the bonds of Aulad, and bade him lead him 
<A NAME="398"></A>into the city where Kai Kaous pined in his bondage. And Aulad led him. 
<A NAME="399"></A>Now when they neared the city, Rakush neighed so loud that the sound pierced 
<A NAME="400"></A>even unto the spot where Kai Kaous was hidden. And the Shah, when he heard 
<A NAME="401"></A>it, rejoiced, for he knew that succour was come. And he told it unto his 
<A NAME="402"></A>comrades. But they refused to listen unto these words, and deemed that 
<A NAME="403"></A>grief had distraught his wits. In vain therefore did Kai Kaous insist unto 
<A NAME="404"></A>them that his ears had heard the voice of Rakush. But not long did he combat 
<A NAME="405"></A>their unbelief, for presently there came before him Tehemten, the stout 
<A NAME="406"></A>of limb, and when the nobles heard his voice and his step they repented 
<A NAME="407"></A>them of their doubts. And Kai Kaous embraced Rustem and blessed him, and 
<A NAME="408"></A>questioned him of his journey and of Zal. Then he said-
<A NAME="409"></A><BR><BR>"O my Pehliva, we may no longer waste the moments with sweet words. 
<A NAME="410"></A>I must send thee forth yet again to battle. For when the White Deev shall 
<A NAME="411"></A>learn that Arzang is defeated, he will come forth from out his mountain 
<A NAME="412"></A>fastness, and bring with him the whole multitude of evil ones, and even 
<A NAME="413"></A>thy might will not stand before them. Go therefore unto the Seven Mountains, 
<A NAME="414"></A>and conquer the White Deev ere the tidings reach him of thy coming. Unto 
<A NAME="415"></A>thee alone can Iran look for her succour, for I cannot aid thee, neither 
<A NAME="416"></A>can my warriors assist thee with their arms, for our eyes are filled with 
<A NAME="417"></A>darkness, and their light is gone out. Yet I grieve to send thee into this 
<A NAME="418"></A>emprise alone, for I have heard it spoken that the dwelling of the Deevs 
<A NAME="419"></A>is a spot of fear and terror, but alas! my grief is of no avail. And I 
<A NAME="420"></A>conjure thee, slay the Deev, and bring unto me the blood of his heart, 
<A NAME="421"></A>for a Mubid hath revealed unto me that only by this blood can our sight 
<A NAME="422"></A>be restored. And go forth now, my son, and may Ormuzd be gracious unto 
<A NAME="423"></A>thee, and may the tree of gladness sprout again for 
<A NAME="424"></A>Iran!
<A NAME="425"></A><BR><BR>Then Rustem did as Kai Kaous commanded, and he rode forth, and 
<A NAME="426"></A>Aulad went beside him to lead him in the way. And when they had passed 
<A NAME="427"></A>the Seven Mountains and were come unto the gates of hell, Rustem spake 
<A NAME="428"></A>unto Aulad, and said-
<A NAME="429"></A><BR><BR>"Thou hast ever led me aright, and all that thou hast spoken I 
<A NAME="430"></A>have surely found it true. Tell me, therefore, now how I shall vanquish 
<A NAME="431"></A>the Deevs."
<A NAME="432"></A><BR><BR>And Aulad said, "Tarry, I counsel thee, till that the sun be high 
<A NAME="433"></A>in the heavens. For when it beateth fierce upon the earth the Deevs are 
<A NAME="434"></A>wont to lay them down to slumber, and when they are drunk with sleep they 
<A NAME="435"></A>shall fall an easy prey into thine hands."
<A NAME="436"></A><BR><BR>Then Rustem did as Aulad bade him, and he halted by the roadside, 
<A NAME="437"></A>and he bound Aulad from head to foot in his snare, and he seated himself 
<A NAME="438"></A>upon the ends. But when the sun was high he drew forth his sword from out 
<A NAME="439"></A>its sheath, and shouted loud his name, and flung it among the Deevs like 
<A NAME="440"></A>to a thunderbolt. Then before they were well awakened from their sleep, 
<A NAME="441"></A>he threw himself upon them, and none could resist him, and he scattered 
<A NAME="442"></A>their heads with his sword. And when he had dispersed the guards he came 
<A NAME="443"></A>unto the lair of the White Deev.
<A NAME="444"></A><BR><BR>Then Rustem stepped within the rocky tomb wherein the Deev was 
<A NAME="445"></A>hidden, and the air was murky and heavy with evil odours, and the Pehliva 
<A NAME="446"></A>could not see his path. But he went on void of fear, though the spot was 
<A NAME="447"></A>fearful and dangers lurked in its sides. And when he was come unto the 
<A NAME="448"></A>end of the cave he found a great mass like to a mountain, and it was the 
<A NAME="449"></A>Deev in his midday slumber. Then Rustem woke him, and the Deev was astonished 
<A NAME="450"></A>at his daring, and sprang at the hero, and threw a great stone like a small 
<A NAME="451"></A>mountain upon him. And Rustem's heart trembled, and he said unto himself, 
<A NAME="452"></A>"If I escape to-day, I shall live for ever." And he fell on the Deev, and 
<A NAME="453"></A>they struggled hot and sore, and the Deev tore Rustem, but Rustem defended 
<A NAME="454"></A>himself, and they wrestled with force till that the blood and sweat ran 
<A NAME="455"></A>down in rivers from their bodies. Then Rustem prayed to God, and God heard 
<A NAME="456"></A>him and gave him strength, and in the end Rustem overcame the White Deev 
<A NAME="457"></A>and slew him. And he severed his head from his trunk, and cut his heart 
<A NAME="458"></A>from out his midst.
<A NAME="459"></A><BR><BR>Then Rustem returned him unto Aulad and told him what he had done. 
<A NAME="460"></A>And Aulad said-
<A NAME="461"></A><BR><BR>"O brave lion, who hast vanquished the world with thy sword, release 
<A NAME="462"></A>now, I pray thee, this thy servant, for thy snare is entered into my flesh. 
<A NAME="463"></A>And suffer that I recall to thee how that thou hast promised to me a recompense, 
<A NAME="464"></A>and surely thou wilt fulfil thy word."
<A NAME="465"></A><BR><BR>And Rustem answered and said, "Ay, verily; but I have yet much 
<A NAME="466"></A>to do ere that my mission be ended. For I have still to conquer the King 
<A NAME="467"></A>of Mazinderan; but when these things shall be accomplished, in truth I 
<A NAME="468"></A>will fulfil my words unto thee."
<A NAME="469"></A><BR><BR>Then he bade Aulad follow him, and they retraced their steps until 
<A NAME="470"></A>they were come unto the spot where Kai Kaous was held in bondage. And when 
<A NAME="471"></A>Kai Kaous learned that Rustem was returned with victory upon his brow he 
<A NAME="472"></A>shouted for joy, and all the host shouted with him, and they could not 
<A NAME="473"></A>contain themselves for happiness. And they called down the blessings of 
<A NAME="474"></A>Heaven upon the head of Rustem. But when the hero came before them, he 
<A NAME="475"></A>took of the blood of the White Deev and poured it into their eyes, and 
<A NAME="476"></A>the eyes of Kai Kaous and his men were opened, and they once again beheld 
<A NAME="477"></A>the glory of the day. Then they swept the ground around them with fire, 
<A NAME="478"></A>with swords they overcame their gaolers. But when they had finished, Kai 
<A NAME="479"></A>Kaous bade them desist from further bloodshed.
<A NAME="480"></A><BR><BR>Then Kai Kaous wrote a letter unto the King of Mazinderan, and 
<A NAME="481"></A>he counselled him that he should conclude a peace. And he related to him 
<A NAME="482"></A>how that his mainstay was broken, for Rustem had overcome Arzang and slain 
<A NAME="483"></A>the White Deev. And he said that Rustem would slay him also if he should 
<A NAME="484"></A>not submit unto Iran and pay tribute to its Shah. Then Kai Kaous sent a 
<A NAME="485"></A>messenger with this writing unto the King of Mazinderan.
<A NAME="486"></A><BR><BR>Now the King, when he had read the letter, and learned how that 
<A NAME="487"></A>Arzang and the White Deev and all his train were slain, was sore troubled, 
<A NAME="488"></A>and he paled in his spirit, and it seemed to him that the sun of his glory 
<A NAME="489"></A>was about to set. Howbeit he suffered not the messenger to behold his distress, 
<A NAME="490"></A>but wrote haughty words unto Kai Kaous, and dared him to come forth to 
<A NAME="491"></A>meet him. And he boasted of his might and reproached Kai Kaous with his 
<A NAME="492"></A>folly. And he threatened that he would raze Iran unto the 
<A NAME="493"></A>dust.
<A NAME="494"></A><BR><BR>When Kai Kaous had read this answer he was wroth, and his nobles 
<A NAME="495"></A>with him. And Rustem spake and said-
<A NAME="496"></A><BR><BR>"Permit me, O my Shah, that I go forth before the King of Mazinderan, 
<A NAME="497"></A>and intrust unto me yet another writing."
<A NAME="498"></A><BR><BR>Then Kai Kaous sent for a scribe, and the scribe cut a reed like 
<A NAME="499"></A>to the point of an arrow, and he wrote with it the words that Kai Kaous 
<A NAME="500"></A>dictated. And Kai Kaous made not many words. He bade the King lay aside 
<A NAME="501"></A>his arrogance, and he warned him of the fate that would await his disobedience, 
<A NAME="502"></A>and he said unto him that if he listened not he might hang his severed 
<A NAME="503"></A>head on the walls of his own city. Then he signed the letter with his royal 
<A NAME="504"></A>seal, and Rustem bore it forth from the camp.
<A NAME="505"></A><BR><BR>Now when the King of Mazinderan learned that Kai Kaous sent him 
<A NAME="506"></A>yet another messenger, he bade the flower of his army go forth to meet 
<A NAME="507"></A>him. And Rustem, when he saw them come near, laid hold upon a tree of great 
<A NAME="508"></A>stature and spreading branches that grew by the wayside. And he uprooted 
<A NAME="509"></A>the tree from the earth, and brandished it in his hands like to a javelin. 
<A NAME="510"></A>And those that saw it were amazed at his strength. Then Rustem, when he 
<A NAME="511"></A>beheld their awe, flung the tree among them, and many a brave man was dismounted 
<A NAME="512"></A>by this mace. Then there stepped forth from the midst of the host one of 
<A NAME="513"></A>the giants of Mazinderan, and he begged that he might grasp Rustem by the 
<A NAME="514"></A>hand. And when he had hold of the hand of the Pehliva he pressed it with 
<A NAME="515"></A>all his might, for he thought that he could wring off this hand of valour. 
<A NAME="516"></A>But Rustem smiled at the feebleness of his grasp, and he grasped him in 
<A NAME="517"></A>return, and the giant grew pale, and the veins started forth upon his 
<A NAME="518"></A>hands.
<A NAME="519"></A><BR><BR>Then one set off to tell the King what he had seen. And the King 
<A NAME="520"></A>sent forth his doughtiest knight, and bade him retrieve the honour of their 
<A NAME="521"></A>strength. And Kalahour the knight said-
<A NAME="522"></A><BR><BR>"Verily so will I do, and I will force the tears of pain from the 
<A NAME="523"></A>eyes of this messenger."
<A NAME="524"></A><BR><BR>And he came towards Rustem and wrung his hand, and his gripe was 
<A NAME="525"></A>like to a vise, and Rustem felt the pang thereof, and he winced in his 
<A NAME="526"></A>suffering. But he would not let the men of Mazinderan glory in his triumph. 
<A NAME="527"></A>He took the hand of Kalahour in his own, and grasped it and crushed it 
<A NAME="528"></A>till that the blood issued from its veins and the nails fell from off its 
<A NAME="529"></A>fingers. Then Kalahour turned him and went before the Shah and showed unto 
<A NAME="530"></A>him his hand. And he counselled him to make peace with the land that could 
<A NAME="531"></A>send forth such messengers whose might none could withstand. But the King 
<A NAME="532"></A>was loath to sue for peace, and he commanded that the messenger be brought 
<A NAME="533"></A>before him.
<A NAME="534"></A><BR><BR>Then the elephant-bodied stood before the King of Mazinderan. And 
<A NAME="535"></A>the King questioned him of his journey, and of Kai Kaous, and of the road 
<A NAME="536"></A>that he was come. And while he questioned he took muster of him with his 
<A NAME="537"></A>eyes, and when he had done speaking he cried-
<A NAME="538"></A><BR><BR>"Surely thou art Rustem, for thou hast the arms and breast of a 
<A NAME="539"></A>Pehliva."
<A NAME="540"></A><BR><BR>But Rustem replied, "Not so, I am but a slave who is not held worthy 
<A NAME="541"></A>to serve even in his train; for he is a Pehliva great and strong, whose 
<A NAME="542"></A>like the earth hath not seen." Then he handed unto the King the writing 
<A NAME="543"></A>of his master. But when the King had read it he was wild with anger, and 
<A NAME="544"></A>he said to Rustem-
<A NAME="545"></A><BR><BR>"Surely he that hath sent thee is mad that he addresseth such words 
<A NAME="546"></A>unto me. For if he be master in Iran, I am lord of Mazinderan, and never 
<A NAME="547"></A>shall he call me his vassal. And verily it was his own overweening that 
<A NAME="548"></A>let him fall between my hands, yet hath he learned no lesson from his disasters, 
<A NAME="549"></A>but deemeth he can crush me with haughty words. Go, say unto him that the 
<A NAME="550"></A>King of Mazinderan will meet him in battle, and verily his pride shall 
<A NAME="551"></A>learn to know humility."
<A NAME="552"></A><BR><BR>And when the King had thus spoken he dismissed Rustem from his 
<A NAME="553"></A>presence, but he would have had him bear forth rich gifts. But Rustem would 
<A NAME="554"></A>not take them, for he too was angered, and he spurred him unto Kai Kaous 
<A NAME="555"></A>with a heart hungry for vengeance.
<A NAME="556"></A><BR><BR>And Kai Kaous made ready his army, and the King of Mazinderan did 
<A NAME="557"></A>likewise. And they marched forth unto the meeting-place, and the earth 
<A NAME="558"></A>groaned under the feet of the war-elephants. And for seven days did the 
<A NAME="559"></A>battle rage fast and furious, and all the earth was darkened with the black 
<A NAME="560"></A>dust; and the fire of swords and maces flashed through the blackness like 
<A NAME="561"></A>to lightning from a thundercloud. And the screams of the Deevs, and the 
<A NAME="562"></A>shouts of the warriors, and the clanging of the trumpets, and the beating 
<A NAME="563"></A>of drums, and the neighing of horses, and the groans of the dying made 
<A NAME="564"></A>the earth hideous with noise. And the blood of the brave turned the plain 
<A NAME="565"></A>into a lake, and it was a combat such as none hath seen the like. But victory 
<A NAME="566"></A>leaned to neither side. Then on the eighth day Kai Kaous took from his 
<A NAME="567"></A>head the crown of the Kaianides and bowed him in the dust before Ormuzd. 
<A NAME="568"></A>And he prayed and said-
<A NAME="569"></A><BR><BR>"O Lord of earth, incline thine ear unto my voice, and grant that 
<A NAME="570"></A>I may overcome these Deevs who rest not their faith in Thee. And I pray 
<A NAME="571"></A>Thee do this not for my sake, who am unworthy of Thy benefits, but for 
<A NAME="572"></A>the sake of Iran, Thy kingdom."
<A NAME="573"></A><BR><BR>Then he put the crown once more upon his head, and went out again 
<A NAME="574"></A>before the army.
<A NAME="575"></A><BR><BR>And all that day the hosts fought like lions, and pity and mercy 
<A NAME="576"></A>were vanished from the world, and heaven itself seemed to rain maces. But 
<A NAME="577"></A>Ormuzd had heard the prayer of His servant, and when evening was come the 
<A NAME="578"></A>army of Mazinderan was faded like a flower. Then Rustem, perceiving the 
<A NAME="579"></A>King of Mazinderan, challenged him to single combat. And the King consented, 
<A NAME="580"></A>and Rustem overcame him, and raised his lance to strike him, 
<A NAME="581"></A>saying-
<A NAME="582"></A><BR><BR>"Perish, O evil Deev! for thy name is struck out of the lists of 
<A NAME="583"></A>those who carry high their heads."
<A NAME="584"></A><BR><BR>But when he was about to strike him, the King put forth his arts 
<A NAME="585"></A>of magic, and he was changed into a rock within sight of all the army. 
<A NAME="586"></A>And Rustem was confounded thereat, and he knew not what he should do. But 
<A NAME="587"></A>Kai Kaous commanded that the rock should be brought before his throne. 
<A NAME="588"></A>So those among the army who were strong of limb meshed it with cords and 
<A NAME="589"></A>tried to raise it from the earth. But the rock resisted all their efforts 
<A NAME="590"></A>and none could move it a jot. Then Rustem, the elephant-limbed, came forward 
<A NAME="591"></A>to test his power, and he grasped the rock in his mighty fist, and he bore 
<A NAME="592"></A>it in his hands across the hills, even unto the spot that Kai Kaous had 
<A NAME="593"></A>named, and all the army shouted with amazement when they saw 
<A NAME="594"></A>it.
<A NAME="595"></A><BR><BR>Now when Rustem had laid down the stone at the feet of the Shah, 
<A NAME="596"></A>he spake and said unto it-
<A NAME="597"></A><BR><BR>"Issue forth, I command thee, O King of Mazinderan, or I will break 
<A NAME="598"></A>thee into atoms with my mace."
<A NAME="599"></A><BR><BR>When the King heard this threat he was afraid, and came out of 
<A NAME="600"></A>the stone, and stood before Rustem in all his vileness. And Rustem took 
<A NAME="601"></A>his hand and smiled and led him before Kai Kaous, and 
<A NAME="602"></A>said-
<A NAME="603"></A><BR><BR>"I bring thee this piece of rock, whom fear of my blows hath brought 
<A NAME="604"></A>into subjection."
<A NAME="605"></A><BR><BR>Then Kai Kaous reproached the King with all the evil he had done 
<A NAME="606"></A>him, and when he had spoken he bade that the head of this wicked man should 
<A NAME="607"></A>be severed from its trunk. And it was done as Kai Kaous commanded. Then 
<A NAME="608"></A>Kai Kaous gave thanks unto God, and distributed rich gifts unto his army, 
<A NAME="609"></A>to each man according to his deserts. And he prepared a feast, and bade 
<A NAME="610"></A>them rejoice and make merry with wine. And at last he called before him 
<A NAME="611"></A>Rustem, his Pehliva, and gave to him thanks, and said that but for his 
<A NAME="612"></A>aid he would not have sat again upon his throne. But Rustem 
<A NAME="613"></A>said-
<A NAME="614"></A><BR><BR>"Not so, O King, thy thanks are due unto Aulad, for he it was who 
<A NAME="615"></A>led me aright, and instructed me how I could vanquish the Deevs. Grant, 
<A NAME="616"></A>therefore, now that I may fulfil my promise unto him, and bestow on him 
<A NAME="617"></A>the crown of Mazinderan."
<A NAME="618"></A><BR><BR>When Kai Kaous heard these words he did as Rustem desired, and 
<A NAME="619"></A>Aulad received the crown and the land, and there was peace yet again in 
<A NAME="620"></A>Iran. And the land rejoiced thereat, and Kai Kaous opened the doors of 
<A NAME="621"></A>his treasures, and all was well within his borders. Then Rustem came before 
<A NAME="622"></A>the Shah and prayed that he might be permitted to return unto his father. 
<A NAME="623"></A>And Kai Kaous listened to the just desires of his Pehliva, and he sent 
<A NAME="624"></A>him forth laden with rich gifts, and he could not cease from pouring treasure 
<A NAME="625"></A>before him. And he blessed him, and said-
<A NAME="626"></A><BR><BR>"Mayst thou live as long as the sun and moon, and may thy heart 
<A NAME="627"></A>continue steadfast, mayst thou ever be the joy of Iran!"
<A NAME="628"></A><BR><BR>Then when Rustem was departed, Kai Kaous gave himself up unto delights 
<A NAME="629"></A>and to wine, but he governed his land right gloriously. He struck the neck 
<A NAME="630"></A>of care with the sword of justice, he caused the earth to be clad with 
<A NAME="631"></A>verdure, and God granted unto him His countenance, and the hand of Ahriman 
<A NAME="632"></A>could do no hurt.
<A NAME="633"></A><BR><BR>Thus endeth the history of the march into Mazinderan.
