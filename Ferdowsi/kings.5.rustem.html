<A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A>Now ere the son of Zal was born, Rudabeh was sore afflicted, and neither 
<A NAME="11"></A>by day nor night could she find rest. Then Zal in his trouble bethought 
<A NAME="12"></A>him of the Simurgh, his nurse, and how she had given unto him a feather 
<A NAME="13"></A>that he might use it in the hour of his need. And he cast the feather into 
<A NAME="14"></A>the fire as she had commanded, and straightway a sound of rushing wings 
<A NAME="15"></A>filled the air, and the sky was darkened and the bird of God stood before 
<A NAME="16"></A>Zal. And she said unto him-
<A NAME="17"></A><BR><BR>"O my son, wherefore art thou troubled, and why are the eyes of 
<A NAME="18"></A>this lion wet with tears?"
<A NAME="19"></A><BR><BR>Then he told her of his sorrow, and she bade him be of good cheer, 
<A NAME="20"></A>"For verily thy nurse who shielded thee, and reared thee when thy father 
<A NAME="21"></A>cast thee out, is come yet again to succour thee."
<A NAME="22"></A><BR><BR>And she told him how he should act, and when she had done speaking 
<A NAME="23"></A>she turned her once more towards her nest. But Zal did as she had commanded, 
<A NAME="24"></A>and there was born to him a son comely of limb. And when Rudabeh beheld 
<A NAME="25"></A>the babe, she smiled and said-
<A NAME="26"></A><BR><BR>"Verily he shall be called Rustem (which, being interpreted, meaneth 
<A NAME="27"></A>delivered), for I am delivered of my pains."
<A NAME="28"></A><BR><BR>And all the land was glad that a son was come unto Zal the hero, 
<A NAME="29"></A>and the sounds of feasting and joy were heard throughout its 
<A NAME="30"></A>breadth.
<A NAME="31"></A><BR><BR>Then fleet messengers brought the sweet tidings unto Saum. And 
<A NAME="32"></A>they bare with them an image of Rustem sewn of silk, whereon were traced 
<A NAME="33"></A>the features of this lion's whelp, and a club was put into its hands, and 
<A NAME="34"></A>it was mounted upon a dromedary. Now when Saum beheld the image his heart 
<A NAME="35"></A>leaped up within him. He poured mountains of gold before the messengers, 
<A NAME="36"></A>and gave thanks unto Ormuzd that he had suffered his eyes to look upon 
<A NAME="37"></A>this child.
<A NAME="38"></A><BR><BR>And when eight summers had rolled above their heads, Saum learned 
<A NAME="39"></A>that Rustem was mighty of stature and fair of mien, and his heart yearned 
<A NAME="40"></A>towards him. He therefore made ready a mighty host and passed unto Zaboulistan, 
<A NAME="41"></A>that he might look upon his son. And Rustem rode forth to meet his sire, 
<A NAME="42"></A>mounted upon an elephant of war, and when he beheld Saum he fell upon his 
<A NAME="43"></A>face and craved his blessing. And Saum blessed Rustem, the son of 
<A NAME="44"></A>Zal.
<A NAME="45"></A><BR><BR>Then Rustem spake unto Saum and said, "O Pehliva, I rejoice in 
<A NAME="46"></A>that I am sprung from thee, for my desires are not after the feast, neither 
<A NAME="47"></A>do I covet sleep or rest. My heart is fixed upon valour, a horse do I crave 
<A NAME="48"></A>and a saddle, a coat of mail and a helmet, and my delight is in the arrow. 
<A NAME="49"></A>Thine enemies will I vanquish, and may my courage be like unto 
<A NAME="50"></A>thine."
<A NAME="51"></A><BR><BR>And Saum, when he had heard these words, was astonished, and blessed 
<A NAME="52"></A>Rustem yet again. And his eyes could not cease from gazing upon the face 
<A NAME="53"></A>of the boy, and he lingered in the land until a moon had run her 
<A NAME="54"></A>course.
<A NAME="55"></A><BR><BR>Now it befell that when yet two springs had passed, Rustem was 
<A NAME="56"></A>awakened from his slumber by a mighty roaring that shook the walls of the 
<A NAME="57"></A>house, even unto the foundation, and a cry went forth that the white elephant 
<A NAME="58"></A>of the King had broken its chain in fury, and that the housemates were 
<A NAME="59"></A>in danger. And Rustem, when he learned it, sprang from his bed, and desired 
<A NAME="60"></A>of the guards that they should suffer him to pass into the court that he 
<A NAME="61"></A>might conquer the beast. But the guards barred the way from him, 
<A NAME="62"></A>saying-
<A NAME="63"></A><BR><BR>"How can we answer for it before the King if thou run into 
<A NAME="64"></A>danger?"
<A NAME="65"></A><BR><BR>But Rustem would not listen to their voice. He forced a passage 
<A NAME="66"></A>for himself with his mighty arms, with his strong fists he broke down the 
<A NAME="67"></A>barriers of the door. And when he was without he beheld how that all the 
<A NAME="68"></A>warriors were sore afraid of the elephant, because that he was mad with 
<A NAME="69"></A>rage. And Rustem was ashamed for them in his soul, and he ran towards the 
<A NAME="70"></A>beast with a loud cry. Then the elephant, when he saw him, raised his trunk 
<A NAME="71"></A>to strike him, but Rustem beat him upon the head with his club, and smote 
<A NAME="72"></A>him that he died. And when he had done this deed, he returned unto his 
<A NAME="73"></A>bed and slept until the morning. But the news of his prowess spread throughout 
<A NAME="74"></A>the house of the King and far into the land, even unto the realms of Saum. 
<A NAME="75"></A>And Zal, and all men with him, rejoiced because a hero was arisen in 
<A NAME="76"></A>Iran.
<A NAME="77"></A><BR><BR>Now, while these things were passing in the house of Zal, in the 
<A NAME="78"></A>land of Zaboulistan, Minuchihr made him ready to pass from the world, for 
<A NAME="79"></A>he had reached twice sixty years. He called before him Nauder his son, 
<A NAME="80"></A>and gave him wise counsels, and exhorted him that he should ever walk in 
<A NAME="81"></A>the paths of wisdom. And he bade him rest his throne upon the strength 
<A NAME="82"></A>of Saum and Zal, and the child that was sprung from their loins. Then when 
<A NAME="83"></A>he had spoken, Minuchihr closed his eyes and sighed, and there remained 
<A NAME="84"></A>of him only a memory in the world.
<A NAME="85"></A><BR><BR>But Nauder forgot the counsels of his father. He vexed the land 
<A NAME="86"></A>and reigned in anger, and cruel deeds were committed in his name, so that 
<A NAME="87"></A>the people rose up and cried against the King. And men of might came unto 
<A NAME="88"></A>Saum and laid before him their plaints, and the petitions of the people, 
<A NAME="89"></A>and they prayed that he would wrest the crown from the head of Nauder, 
<A NAME="90"></A>and place it upon his own. But Saum was sore grieved when he had heard 
<A NAME="91"></A>these words, and he spake, saying-
<A NAME="92"></A><BR><BR>"Not so, for it beseemeth me not to put out my hand after the crown, 
<A NAME="93"></A>for Nauder is of the race of the Kaianides, and unto them is given majesty 
<A NAME="94"></A>and might."
<A NAME="95"></A><BR><BR>Then he girt his sword about his loins, and took with him a host, 
<A NAME="96"></A>and rode before the face of the Shah. And when he was come unto him, Saum 
<A NAME="97"></A>exhorted him with prayers and tears that he would turn him from the paths 
<A NAME="98"></A>of evil. And Nauder listened unto the voice of Saum the Pehliva, and joy 
<A NAME="99"></A>was abroad once more.
<A NAME="100"></A><BR><BR>But the tidings spread, even into Turan, that Minuchihr the just 
<A NAME="101"></A>was departed, and that the hand of Nauder was heavy upon the land. And 
<A NAME="102"></A>Poshang, who was of the race of Tur, heard the news thereof with gladness, 
<A NAME="103"></A>for he deemed that the time was ripe to remember the vengeance that was 
<A NAME="104"></A>due unto the blood of his sire. Therefore he called about him his warriors, 
<A NAME="105"></A>and bade them go forth to war against Iran, saying the time was come to 
<A NAME="106"></A>avenge his father and draw unto himself the heritage. And while his son 
<A NAME="107"></A>Afrasiyab made ready the host to fulfil the desire of his father, there 
<A NAME="108"></A>spread the news that Saum the Pehliva had been gathered unto the dust, 
<A NAME="109"></A>and that Zal tarried in his house to build him a tomb. And the news gave 
<A NAME="110"></A>courage unto Afrasiyab and his men, and they made haste to gain the 
<A NAME="111"></A>frontier.
<A NAME="112"></A><BR><BR>But the grandson of Feridoun had learned of their coming, and he 
<A NAME="113"></A>prepared him to meet the foes of his land. Then he sent forth an army that 
<A NAME="114"></A>overshadowed the earth in its progress. But the army of Afrasiyab was great 
<A NAME="115"></A>also, and it covered the ground like unto ants and locusts. And both hosts 
<A NAME="116"></A>pitched their tents in the plains of Dehstan, and made them ready for the 
<A NAME="117"></A>fight. And the horses neighed loud, and the pawing of their hoofs shook 
<A NAME="118"></A>the deep places of the earth, and the dust of their trampling uprose even 
<A NAME="119"></A>unto heaven. Then when they had put their men into array, they fell upon 
<A NAME="120"></A>each other, and for two days did they rage in fierce combat, neither did 
<A NAME="121"></A>the victory lean to either side. And the clamour and confusion were mighty, 
<A NAME="122"></A>and earth and sky seemed blended into one. And the carnage was great, and 
<A NAME="123"></A>blood flowed like water, and heads fell from their trunks like unto autumn 
<A NAME="124"></A>leaves that are withered. But on the third day it came about that the upper 
<A NAME="125"></A>hand was given unto the men of Turan, and Nauder the King, and the flower 
<A NAME="126"></A>of his army with him, fell into the hands of the foe.
<A NAME="127"></A><BR><BR>Then Afrasiyab cut off the head of Nauder the Shah, and sat himself 
<A NAME="128"></A>down upon the throne of light. And he proclaimed himself lord of Iran, 
<A NAME="129"></A>and required of all men that they should do him homage, and pour gifts 
<A NAME="130"></A>before his face. But the people would not listen unto his voice, and they 
<A NAME="131"></A>sent messengers into Seistan, and craved counsel of the Pehliva in their 
<A NAME="132"></A>distress. And Zal, when he heard their tidings, cast aside the sorrow for 
<A NAME="133"></A>Saum his father, and girded his loins in enmity against the son of Tur. 
<A NAME="134"></A>And he bade the Iranians choose out Zew, the son of Thamasp, of the blood 
<A NAME="135"></A>of Feridoun, of wisdom in speech, that he should rule over them on the 
<A NAME="136"></A>throne of the Kaianides. And the people did as Zal commanded.
<A NAME="137"></A><BR><BR>Now the throne of Feridoun grew young again under the sway of Zew. 
<A NAME="138"></A>With power did he beat back the host of Turan, a covenant of peace did 
<A NAME="139"></A>he wring from their hands. And it was written that the Jihun should divide 
<A NAME="140"></A>the lands, and that the power of Zal the Pehliva should end where men take 
<A NAME="141"></A>up their abode in tents. And Zew ruled rightly in the sight of Ormuzd, 
<A NAME="142"></A>and God gave unto the land the key of abundance. Yet few were the years 
<A NAME="143"></A>that he commanded with equity, and Garshasp his son reigned in his stead. 
<A NAME="144"></A>But neither to him was it given to reign long with glory, and bitter fruit 
<A NAME="145"></A>sprouted yet again from the tree of misfortune. For the throne of the Kaianides 
<A NAME="146"></A>was empty, and Afrasiyab, when he learned thereof, followed the counsels 
<A NAME="147"></A>of Poshang his father, and hurried him unto the land of Iran, that he might 
<A NAME="148"></A>place himself upon the seat of power. And all the men of Iran, when they 
<A NAME="149"></A>learned thereof, were sore afraid, and they turned them once again unto 
<A NAME="150"></A>the son of Saum. And they spake unto him hard words, and heaped reproaches 
<A NAME="151"></A>upon him that he had not averted these dangers from their heads. And Zal 
<A NAME="152"></A>in his heart smiled at their ingratitude and lipwisdom, but he also sorrowed 
<A NAME="153"></A>with them and with his land. And he spake, saying-
<A NAME="154"></A><BR><BR>"I have ever done for you what was fitting and right, and all my 
<A NAME="155"></A>life have I feared no enemy save only old age. But that enemy is now upon 
<A NAME="156"></A>me, therefore I charge you that ye look unto Rustem to deliver you. Howbeit 
<A NAME="157"></A>he shall be backed by the counsels of his father."
<A NAME="158"></A><BR><BR>Then he called before him his son, who was yet of tender age, and 
<A NAME="159"></A>he said unto him-
<A NAME="160"></A><BR><BR>"O my son, thy lips still smell of milk, and thy heart should go 
<A NAME="161"></A>out to pleasure. But the days are grave, and Iran looketh unto thee in 
<A NAME="162"></A>its danger. I must send thee forth to cope with heroes."
<A NAME="163"></A><BR><BR>And Rustem answered and said, "Thou knowest, O my father, that 
<A NAME="164"></A>my desires are rather after war than pleasures. Give unto me, therefore, 
<A NAME="165"></A>a steed of strength and the mace of Saum thy father, and suffer that I 
<A NAME="166"></A>go out to meet the hosts of Ahriman."
<A NAME="167"></A><BR><BR>Then Zal's heart laughed within him when he heard these words of 
<A NAME="168"></A>manhood. And he commanded that all the flocks of horses, both from Zaboulistan 
<A NAME="169"></A>and Cabul, be brought before his son, that he might choose from their midst 
<A NAME="170"></A>his steed of battle. And they were passed in order before Rustem, and he 
<A NAME="171"></A>laid upon the backs of each his hand of might to test them if they could 
<A NAME="172"></A>bear his weight of valour. And the horses shuddered as they bent beneath 
<A NAME="173"></A>his grasp, and sank upon their haunches in weakness. And thus did he do 
<A NAME="174"></A>with them all in turn, until he came unto the flocks of Cabul. Then he 
<A NAME="175"></A>perceived in their midst a mare mighty and strong, and there followed after 
<A NAME="176"></A>her a colt like to its mother, with the chest and shoulders of a lion. 
<A NAME="177"></A>And in strength it seemed like an elephant, and in colour it was as rose 
<A NAME="178"></A>leaves that have been scattered upon a saffron ground. Now Rustem, when 
<A NAME="179"></A>he had tested the colt with his eyes, made a running knot in his cord and 
<A NAME="180"></A>threw it about the beast. And he caught the colt in the snare, though the 
<A NAME="181"></A>mare defended it mightily. Then the keeper of the flock came before Rustem 
<A NAME="182"></A>and said-
<A NAME="183"></A><BR><BR>"O youth puissant and tall, take not, I counsel thee, the horse 
<A NAME="184"></A>of another."
<A NAME="185"></A><BR><BR>And Rustem answered him and asked, "To whom then pertaineth this 
<A NAME="186"></A>steed? I see no mark upon its flanks."
<A NAME="187"></A><BR><BR>And the keeper said, "We know not its master, but rumours are rife 
<A NAME="188"></A>anent it throughout the land, and men name it the Rakush of Rustem. And 
<A NAME="189"></A>I warn thee, the mother will never permit thee to ride on it. Three years 
<A NAME="190"></A>has it been ready for the saddle, but none would she suffer to mount 
<A NAME="191"></A>thereon."
<A NAME="192"></A><BR><BR>Then Rustem, when he heard these words, swung himself upon the 
<A NAME="193"></A>colt with a great bound. And the mare, when she saw it, ran at him and 
<A NAME="194"></A>would have pulled him down, but when she had heard his voice she suffered 
<A NAME="195"></A>it. And the rose-coloured steed bore Rustem along the plains like unto 
<A NAME="196"></A>the wind. Then when he was returned, the son of Zal spake and said to the 
<A NAME="197"></A>keeper-
<A NAME="198"></A><BR><BR>"I pray thee, tell unto me what is the price of this 
<A NAME="199"></A>dragon?"
<A NAME="200"></A><BR>But the keeper replied, "If thou be Rustem, mount him, and retrieve 
<A NAME="201"></A>the sorrows of Iran. For his price is the land of Iran, and seated upon 
<A NAME="202"></A>him thou wilt save the world."
<A NAME="203"></A><BR><BR>And Rustem rejoiced in Rakush (whose name, being interpreted, meaneth 
<A NAME="204"></A>the lightning), and Zal rejoiced with him, and they made them ready to 
<A NAME="205"></A>stand against Afrasiyab.
<A NAME="206"></A><BR><BR>Now it was in the time of roses, and the meadows smiled with verdure, 
<A NAME="207"></A>when Zal led forth his hosts against the offspring of Tur. And the standard 
<A NAME="208"></A>of Kawah streamed upon the breeze, and Mihrab marched on the left, and 
<A NAME="209"></A>Gustahem marched on the right, and Zal went in the midst of the men, but 
<A NAME="210"></A>Rustem went at the head of all. And there followed after him a number like 
<A NAME="211"></A>to the sands of the sea, and the sounds of cymbals and bells made a noise 
<A NAME="212"></A>throughout the land like unto the day of judgment, when the earth shall 
<A NAME="213"></A>cry unto the dead, "Arise." And they marched in order even unto the shores 
<A NAME="214"></A>of the river Rai, and the two armies were but some farsangs 
<A NAME="215"></A>apart.
<A NAME="216"></A><BR><BR>Albeit, when Afrasiyab heard that Rustem and Zal were come out 
<A NAME="217"></A>against him, he was in nowise dismayed, for he said, "The son is but a 
<A NAME="218"></A>boy, and the father is old; it will not, therefore, be hard for me to keep 
<A NAME="219"></A>my power in Iran." And he made ready his warriors with gladness of 
<A NAME="220"></A>heart.
<A NAME="221"></A><BR><BR>But Zal, when he had drawn up his army in battle array, spake unto 
<A NAME="222"></A>them, saying-
<A NAME="223"></A><BR><BR>"O men valiant in fight, we are great in number, but there is wanting 
<A NAME="224"></A>to us a chief, for we are without the counsels of a Shah, and verily no 
<A NAME="225"></A>labour succeedeth when the head is lacking. But rejoice, and be not downcast 
<A NAME="226"></A>in your hearts, for a Mubid hath revealed unto me that there yet liveth 
<A NAME="227"></A>one of the race of Feridoun to whom pertaineth the throne, and that he 
<A NAME="228"></A>is a youth wise and brave."
<A NAME="229"></A><BR><BR>And when he had thus spoken, he turned him to Rustem and 
<A NAME="230"></A>said-
<A NAME="231"></A><BR>"I charge thee, O my son, depart in haste for the Mount Alberz, neither 
<A NAME="232"></A>tarry by the way. And wend thee unto Kai Kobad, and say unto him that his 
<A NAME="233"></A>army awaiteth him, and that the throne of the Kaianides is 
<A NAME="234"></A>empty."
<A NAME="235"></A><BR><BR>And Rustem, when he had heard his father's command, touched with 
<A NAME="236"></A>his eyelashes the ground before his feet, and straightway departed. In 
<A NAME="237"></A>his hand he bare a mace of might, and under him was Rakush the swift of 
<A NAME="238"></A>foot. And he rode till he came within sight of the Mount Alberz, whereon 
<A NAME="239"></A>had stood the cradle of his father. Then he beheld at its foot a house 
<A NAME="240"></A>beauteous like unto that of a king. And around it was spread a garden whence 
<A NAME="241"></A>came the sounds of running waters, and trees of tall stature uprose therein, 
<A NAME="242"></A>and under their shade, by a gurgling rill, there stood a throne, and a 
<A NAME="243"></A>youth, fair like to the moon, was seated thereon. And round about him leaned 
<A NAME="244"></A>knights girt with red sashes of power, and you would have said it was a 
<A NAME="245"></A>paradise for perfume and beauty.
<A NAME="246"></A><BR><BR>Now when those within the garden beheld the son of Zal ride by, 
<A NAME="247"></A>they came out unto him and said-
<A NAME="248"></A><BR><BR>"O Pehliva, it behoveth us not to let thee go farther before thou 
<A NAME="249"></A>hast permitted us to greet thee as our guest. We pray thee, therefore, 
<A NAME="250"></A>descend from off thy horse and drink the cup of friendship in our 
<A NAME="251"></A>house."
<A NAME="252"></A><BR><BR>But Rustem said, "Not so, I thank you, but suffer that I may pass 
<A NAME="253"></A>unto the mountain with an errand that brooketh no delay. For the borders 
<A NAME="254"></A>of Iran are encircled by the enemy, and the throne is empty of a king. 
<A NAME="255"></A>Wherefore I may not stay to taste of wine."
<A NAME="256"></A><BR><BR>Then they answered him, "If thou goest unto the mount, tell us, 
<A NAME="257"></A>we pray thee, thy mission, for unto us is it given to guard its 
<A NAME="258"></A>sides."
<A NAME="259"></A><BR><BR>And Rustem replied, "I seek there a king of the seed of Feridoun, 
<A NAME="260"></A>who cleansed the world of the abominations of Zohak, a youth who reareth 
<A NAME="261"></A>high his head. I pray ye, therefore, if ye know aught of Kai Kobad, that 
<A NAME="262"></A>ye give me tidings where I may find him."
<A NAME="263"></A><BR><BR>Then the youth that sat upon the throne opened his mouth and said, 
<A NAME="264"></A>"Kai Kobad is known unto me, and if thou wilt enter this garden and rejoice 
<A NAME="265"></A>my soul with thy presence I will give thee tidings concerning 
<A NAME="266"></A>him."
<A NAME="267"></A><BR><BR>When Rustem heard these words he sprang from off his horse and 
<A NAME="268"></A>came within the gates. And the youth took his hand and led him unto the 
<A NAME="269"></A>steps of the throne. Then he mounted it yet again, and when he had filled 
<A NAME="270"></A>a cup with wine, he pledged the guest within his gates. Then he gave a 
<A NAME="271"></A>cup unto Rustem, and questioned him wherefore he sought for Kai Kobad, 
<A NAME="272"></A>and at whose desire he was come forth to find him. And Rustem told him 
<A NAME="273"></A>of the Mubids, and how that his father had sent him with all speed to pray 
<A NAME="274"></A>the young King that he would be their Shah, and lead the host against the 
<A NAME="275"></A>enemies of Iran. Then the youth, when he had listened to an end, smiled 
<A NAME="276"></A>and said-
<A NAME="277"></A><BR><BR>"O Pehliva, behold me, for verily I am Kai Kobad of the race of 
<A NAME="278"></A>Feridoun!"
<A NAME="279"></A><BR><BR>And Rustem, when he had heard these words, fell on the ground before 
<A NAME="280"></A>his feet, and saluted him Shah. Then the King raised him, and commanded 
<A NAME="281"></A>that the slaves should give him yet another cup of wine, and he bore it 
<A NAME="282"></A>to his lips in honour of Rustem, the son of Zal, the son of Saum, the son 
<A NAME="283"></A>of Neriman. And they gave a cup also unto Rustem, and he 
<A NAME="284"></A>cried-
<A NAME="285"></A><BR><BR>"May the Shah live for ever!"
<A NAME="286"></A><BR>Then instruments of music rent the air, and joy spread over all the 
<A NAME="287"></A>assembly. But when silence was fallen yet again, Kai Kobad opened his mouth 
<A NAME="288"></A>and said-
<A NAME="289"></A><BR><BR>"Hearken, O my knights, unto the dream that I had dreamed, and 
<A NAME="290"></A>ye will know wherefore I called upon you this day to stand in majesty about 
<A NAME="291"></A>my throne. For in my sleep I beheld two falcons white of wing, and they 
<A NAME="292"></A>came out unto me from Iran, and in their beaks they bare a sunny crown. 
<A NAME="293"></A>And the crown they placed upon my head. And behold now is Rustem come out 
<A NAME="294"></A>unto me like to a white bird, and his father, the nursling of a bird, hath 
<A NAME="295"></A>sent him, and they have given unto me the crown of Iran."
<A NAME="296"></A><BR><BR>And Rustem, when he had heard this dream, said, "Surely thy vision 
<A NAME="297"></A>was given unto thee of God! But now, I pray thee, up and tarry no longer, 
<A NAME="298"></A>for the land of Iran groaneth sore and awaiteth thee with much 
<A NAME="299"></A>travail."
<A NAME="300"></A><BR><BR>So Kai Kobad listened to the desires of Rustem, and swung him upon 
<A NAME="301"></A>his steed of war; and they rode day and night, until they came down from 
<A NAME="302"></A>the hills unto the green plains that are watered by murmuring streams. 
<A NAME="303"></A>And Rustem brought the King safely through the outposts of the enemy; and 
<A NAME="304"></A>when the night was fallen, he led him within the tents of Zal, and none 
<A NAME="305"></A>knew that he was come save only the Mubids. For seven days did they hold 
<A NAME="306"></A>counsel together, and on the eighth the message of the stars was received 
<A NAME="307"></A>with joy. And Zal made ready a throne of ivory and a banquet, and the crown 
<A NAME="308"></A>of Iran was placed upon the head of the young Shah. Then the nobles came 
<A NAME="309"></A>and did homage before him, and they revelled in wine till the night was 
<A NAME="310"></A>far spent. And they prayed him that he would make him ready to lead them 
<A NAME="311"></A>against the Turks. And Kai Kobad mustered the army and did as they 
<A NAME="312"></A>desired.
<A NAME="313"></A><BR><BR>And soon the battle raged hot and strong many days, and deeds of 
<A NAME="314"></A>valour were done on either side; but the men of Turan could not stand against 
<A NAME="315"></A>the men of Iran, neither could the strength of Rustem be broken. For he 
<A NAME="316"></A>put forth the power of a lion, and his shadow extended for miles. And from 
<A NAME="317"></A>that day men named him Tehemten (which being interpreted, meaneth the strong-limbed), 
<A NAME="318"></A>for he did deeds of prowess in the sight of men. And Afrasiyab was discomfited, 
<A NAME="319"></A>and fled before him, and his army followed after, and their hearts were 
<A NAME="320"></A>bruised and full of care.
<A NAME="321"></A><BR><BR>But the Iranians, when they beheld that their foes had vanished 
<A NAME="322"></A>before them, turned them unto Kai Kobad and did homage before his throne. 
<A NAME="323"></A>And Kai Kobad celebrated the victory with much pomp, as is the manner of 
<A NAME="324"></A>kings; and he placed Rustem upon his right hand and Zal upon his left, 
<A NAME="325"></A>and they feasted and made them merry with wine.
<A NAME="326"></A><BR><BR>In the meantime Afrasiyab returned him unto Poshang his father, 
<A NAME="327"></A>who was of the race of Tur. And he came before him right sorrowful and 
<A NAME="328"></A>spake, saying-
<A NAME="329"></A><BR><BR>"O King, whose name is glorious, thou didst evil to provoke this 
<A NAME="330"></A>war. The land which Feridoun the great did give in ancient time unto Tur 
<A NAME="331"></A>the valiant, it hath been delivered unto thee, and the partition was just. 
<A NAME="332"></A>Why, therefore, seekest thou to enlarge thy border? Verily I say, if thou 
<A NAME="333"></A>haste not to make peace with Iran, Kai Kobad will send out against us an 
<A NAME="334"></A>army from the four quarters of the earth, and they will subdue us, and 
<A NAME="335"></A>by our own act we shall make the land too narrow for us. For the world 
<A NAME="336"></A>is not delivered of the race of Irij, and the noxious poison hath not been 
<A NAME="337"></A>converted into honey. For when one dieth another taketh his place, and 
<A NAME="338"></A>never do they leave the world without a master. And there is arisen of 
<A NAME="339"></A>the race of Saum a warrior called Rustem, and none can withstand him. He 
<A NAME="340"></A>hath broken the power of thine host, and the world hath not seen his like 
<A NAME="341"></A>for stoutness; and withal he is but little more than a weanling. Ponder 
<A NAME="342"></A>therefore, O King, how shall it be when he may be come to years of vigour. 
<A NAME="343"></A>Surely I am a man who desireth to possess the world, the stay of thine 
<A NAME="344"></A>army, and thy refuge in danger, but before this boy my power fadeth like 
<A NAME="345"></A>unto the mists that rise above the hills."
<A NAME="346"></A><BR><BR>When the King of Turan had listened to these words, the tears of 
<A NAME="347"></A>bitterness fell from his eyes. Then he called before him a scribe and he 
<A NAME="348"></A>bade him write a letter unto Kai Kobad, the Shah. And the scribe adorned 
<A NAME="349"></A>it with many colours and fair designs. And the scribe 
<A NAME="350"></A>wrote-
<A NAME="351"></A><BR><BR>"In the name of Ormuzd, the ruler of the sun and moon, greeting 
<A NAME="352"></A>and salutation unto Kai Kobad the gracious from the meanest of his servants. 
<A NAME="353"></A>Listen unto me, O valiant Shah, and ponder the words that I shall write. 
<A NAME="354"></A>May grace fall upon the soul of Feridoun, who wove the woof of our race! 
<A NAME="355"></A>Why should we any longer hold the world in confusion? That which he fixed, 
<A NAME="356"></A>surely it was right, for he parted the world with equity, and we do wrong 
<A NAME="357"></A>before him when we depart from the grooves that he hath shaped. I pray 
<A NAME="358"></A>thee, therefore, let us no longer speak of Tur and his evil acts unto Irij, 
<A NAME="359"></A>for if Irij was the cause of our hates, surely by Minuchihr hath he been 
<A NAME="360"></A>avenged. Let us return, then, within the bounds that Feridoun hath blest, 
<A NAME="361"></A>and let us part the world anew, as it was parted for Tur, and Selim, and 
<A NAME="362"></A>Irij. For wherefore should we seek the land of another, since in the end 
<A NAME="363"></A>each will receive in heritage a spot no larger than his body? If then Kai 
<A NAME="364"></A>Kobad will listen unto my prayer, let the Jihun be the boundary between 
<A NAME="365"></A>us, and none of my people shall behold its waters, nay, not even in a dream, 
<A NAME="366"></A>neither shall any Iranian cross its floods, save only in 
<A NAME="367"></A>amity."
<A NAME="368"></A><BR><BR>And the King put his seal upon the letter and sent it unto Kai 
<A NAME="369"></A>Kobad, and the messenger bare with him rich gifts of jewels and steeds 
<A NAME="370"></A>of Araby. And when Kai Kobad had read the letter he smiled in his spirit 
<A NAME="371"></A>and said-
<A NAME="372"></A><BR><BR>"Verily not my people sought out this war but Afrasiyab, who deemed 
<A NAME="373"></A>that he could wrest unto himself the crown of Iran, and could subdue the 
<A NAME="374"></A>masterless land unto his will. And he hath but followed in the footsteps 
<A NAME="375"></A>of Tur his father, for even as he robbed the throne of Irij, so did Afrasiyab 
<A NAME="376"></A>take from it Nauder the Shah. And I say to you that I need not make peace 
<A NAME="377"></A>with you because of any fear, but I will do it because war is not pleasing 
<A NAME="378"></A>unto me. I will give unto you, therefore, the farther side of the river, 
<A NAME="379"></A>and it shall be a boundary between us, and I pray that Afrasiyab may find 
<A NAME="380"></A>rest within his borders."
<A NAME="381"></A><BR><BR>And Kai Kobad did according to his word. He drew up a fresh covenant 
<A NAME="382"></A>between them, and planted a new tree in the garden of power. And the messenger 
<A NAME="383"></A>took the writing unto Poshang, King of Turan, and Kai Kobad proclaimed 
<A NAME="384"></A>that there was peace throughout the land.
<A NAME="385"></A><BR><BR>Now for the space of an hundred years did Kai Kobad rule over Iran, 
<A NAME="386"></A>and he administered his realm with clemency, and the earth was quiet before 
<A NAME="387"></A>him, and he gat his people great honour, and I ask of you what king can 
<A NAME="388"></A>be likened unto him? But when this time had passed, his strength waned, 
<A NAME="389"></A>and he knew that a green leaf was about to fade. So he called before him 
<A NAME="390"></A>Kai Kaous his son, and gave unto him counsels many and wise. And when he 
<A NAME="391"></A>had done speaking he bade them make ready his grave, and he exchanged the 
<A NAME="392"></A>palace for the tomb. And thus endeth the history of Kai Kobad the glorious. 
<A NAME="393"></A>It behoveth us now to speak of his son.
