<A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A>Mourning and sorrow filled the heart of Afrasiyab because of his defeat, 
<A NAME="11"></A>and he pondered in his spirit how the fortunes of Iran might be retrieved. 
<A NAME="12"></A>So he sent messengers unto all his vassals that they should unsheathe the 
<A NAME="13"></A>sword of strife and make ready an army. And the nobles did as Afrasiyab 
<A NAME="14"></A>bade them, and they got together an host that covered the ground, and sent 
<A NAME="15"></A>it forth before the King. And the King placed Schideh his son at the head 
<A NAME="16"></A>thereof, and he said unto him-
<A NAME="17"></A><BR><BR>"Open not the door of peace, neither treat Kai Khosrau other than 
<A NAME="18"></A>as an enemy."
<A NAME="19"></A><BR><BR>Now when the Shah heard tidings of the army that Afrasiyab had 
<A NAME="20"></A>made ready against him, he commanded that no man who could use the bridle 
<A NAME="21"></A>and the stirrup should stay within the borders of Iran. And when the army 
<A NAME="22"></A>was ready he placed at its head Gudarz the wise. But Kai Khosrau bade yet 
<A NAME="23"></A>again that Gudarz should seek to win Piran the Pehliva unto Iran ere the 
<A NAME="24"></A>hosts met in battle. For the Shah remembered the benefits he had received 
<A NAME="25"></A>at his hands, and it grieved him sore to go out against him in enmity. 
<A NAME="26"></A>And Gudarz did as the Shah desired, and when he had crossed the Jihun he 
<A NAME="27"></A>sent Gew, his son, unto Piran that he might speak with him. But Piran shut 
<A NAME="28"></A>ear unto the voice of Gew, and he said that he had led forth his army to 
<A NAME="29"></A>battle, and that it behoved him to do that which was commanded of 
<A NAME="30"></A>Afrasiyab.
<A NAME="31"></A><BR><BR>So the two armies were drawn up in order of battle, and each desired 
<A NAME="32"></A>that the other should fall upon them the first. And for three days and 
<A NAME="33"></A>three nights they faced each other, and you would have said that no man 
<A NAME="34"></A>so much as moved his lips. And Gudarz was posted before his men, and day 
<A NAME="35"></A>and night he searched the stars and the sun and moon for augury. And he 
<A NAME="36"></A>demanded of them whether he should advance or whether he should stay. And 
<A NAME="37"></A>Piran also waited that he might behold what the Iranians would 
<A NAME="38"></A>do.
<A NAME="39"></A><BR><BR>But Byzun was angry thereat, and he went before his father and 
<A NAME="40"></A>entreated him to urge his grandsire unto action. "For surely," he said, 
<A NAME="41"></A>"Gudarz hath lost his wits that he thus regardeth the sun and stars, and 
<A NAME="42"></A>thinketh not of the enemy." And Gew strove in vain to quiet 
<A NAME="43"></A>him.
<A NAME="44"></A><BR><BR>And in the ranks of Turan also Human grew impatient, and he asked 
<A NAME="45"></A>permission of his brother to challenge the nobles of Iran to single fight. 
<A NAME="46"></A>And Piran sought to dissuade him in vain. So he got ready his steed of 
<A NAME="47"></A>battle, and rode until he came within the lines of Iran. And when he was 
<A NAME="48"></A>come thither he sought out Rehham, the son of Gudarz, and challenged him 
<A NAME="49"></A>to measure his strength. But Rehham said-
<A NAME="50"></A><BR><BR>"My soul thirsteth after the combat, yet since my father hath commanded 
<A NAME="51"></A>that the army advance not, it beseemeth me not to forget his behests. And 
<A NAME="52"></A>remember, O valiant Turk, that he who ventureth first upon the battlefield 
<A NAME="53"></A>hath no need to seek the pathway to return."
<A NAME="54"></A><BR><BR>Then Human said, "Men had told unto me that Rehham was a knight 
<A NAME="55"></A>of courage, but now I know that he is afraid." And he turned away his steed 
<A NAME="56"></A>and rode until he came nigh unto Friburz, and he challenged him also in 
<A NAME="57"></A>words of pride, and he said-
<A NAME="58"></A><BR><BR>"Thou art brother unto Saiawush, show now if there live within 
<A NAME="59"></A>thee aught of valour."
<A NAME="60"></A><BR><BR>But Friburz answered, "Go forth before Gudarz and demand of him 
<A NAME="61"></A>that I may fight, and verily if he listen unto thy voice, it will be a 
<A NAME="62"></A>joy unto my soul."
<A NAME="63"></A><BR><BR>Then Human said, "I see that thou art a hero only in words." And 
<A NAME="64"></A>he turned his back upon him also, and he rode till that he came before 
<A NAME="65"></A>Gudarz the Pehliva. And he raised his voice and spake unto him words of 
<A NAME="66"></A>insolence, and he defied him to lead forth his army. But Gudarz would not 
<A NAME="67"></A>listen unto his voice. Then Human turned him back unto the camp of Turan, 
<A NAME="68"></A>and he said unto the army how that the men of Iran were craven. And when 
<A NAME="69"></A>the army heard it they raised shouts of great joy.
<A NAME="70"></A><BR><BR>Now the shouting of the men of Turan pierced even unto the cars 
<A NAME="71"></A>of the Iranians, and they were sore hurt thereat; and the nobles came before 
<A NAME="72"></A>Gudarz and laid before him their complaints, and they entreated of him 
<A NAME="73"></A>that he would lead them forth that they might prove their valour. And Byzun, 
<A NAME="74"></A>when he heard what had been done, came before his grandsire like to a lion 
<A NAME="75"></A>in his fury, and he craved that he would grant unto him that he might reply 
<A NAME="76"></A>unto the challenge of Human. Now when Gudarz beheld that all the nobles 
<A NAME="77"></A>were against him, he listened unto the ardour of Byzun, and he gave to 
<A NAME="78"></A>him leave to go forth, and he accorded to him the armour of Saiawush, and 
<A NAME="79"></A>he blessed him and bade him be victorious. Then Byzun sent a messenger 
<A NAME="80"></A>unto Human, and the place of combat was chosen. And when the sun was risen 
<A NAME="81"></A>they met upon the field, and Human cried unto his adversary, and he 
<A NAME="82"></A>said-
<A NAME="83"></A><BR><BR>"O Byzun, thine hour is come, for I will send thee back unto Gew 
<A NAME="84"></A>in such guise that his heart shall be torn with anguish."
<A NAME="85"></A><BR><BR>But Byzun answered and said, "Why waste we our time in words, let 
<A NAME="86"></A>us fall upon one another."
<A NAME="87"></A><BR><BR>Then they did as Byzun desired. And they fought with swords and 
<A NAME="88"></A>with arrows, with maces also and with fists, and sore was the struggle 
<A NAME="89"></A>and weary, and the victory leaned unto neither side. And they strove thus 
<A NAME="90"></A>from the time of dawn until the sun had lengthened the shadows, and Byzun 
<A NAME="91"></A>was afraid lest the day should end in doubt. Then he sent up a prayer unto 
<A NAME="92"></A>Ormuzd that He would lend unto him strength. And Ormuzd listened unto the 
<A NAME="93"></A>petition of His servant. Then Byzun caught Human in his arms and flung 
<A NAME="94"></A>him upon the ground, and he beat out his brains, and he severed his head 
<A NAME="95"></A>from off his trunk, that the murder of Saiawush might be avenged. Then 
<A NAME="96"></A>he gave thanks unto God, and turned him back unto the camp, and he bore 
<A NAME="97"></A>aloft the head of Human. And the army of Iran, when they beheld it, set 
<A NAME="98"></A>up a great shout, but from the ranks of Turan there came the noise of wailing. 
<A NAME="99"></A>And Piran was bowed down with grief and anger, and he commanded the army 
<A NAME="100"></A>should go forth and fall upon the Iranians.
<A NAME="101"></A><BR><BR>Now there was fought a battle such as men have not seen the like. 
<A NAME="102"></A>And the earth was covered with steel, and arrows fell from the clouds like 
<A NAME="103"></A>hail, and the ground was torn with hoofs, and blood flowed like water upon 
<A NAME="104"></A>the plains. And the dead lay around in masses, and the feet of the horses 
<A NAME="105"></A>could not stir because of them. Then the chiefs of the army said among 
<A NAME="106"></A>themselves-
<A NAME="107"></A><BR><BR>"If we part not these heroes upon the field of vengeance, there 
<A NAME="108"></A>will remain nought when the night is come save only the earth that turns, 
<A NAME="109"></A>and God, the Master of the world."
<A NAME="110"></A><BR><BR>Yet they withdrew not from the combat until the darkness had thrown 
<A NAME="111"></A>a mantle over the earth, and they could no longer look upon their 
<A NAME="112"></A>foes.
<A NAME="113"></A><BR><BR>Now when the earth was become like unto ebony, the leaders of the 
<A NAME="114"></A>hosts met in conference. And it was decided between them that they should 
<A NAME="115"></A>choose forth valiant men from their midst, and that on the morrow the fate 
<A NAME="116"></A>of the lands should be decided by them. For they grieved for the blood 
<A NAME="117"></A>that had been spilled, and they desired that the hand of destruction be 
<A NAME="118"></A>stayed. So when the morning was come they chose forth their champions, 
<A NAME="119"></A>and ten men of valour were picked from each host, and Piran and Gudarz 
<A NAME="120"></A>led them out unto the plain. Now on each side of the plain uprose a mountain. 
<A NAME="121"></A>So Gudarz said unto his comrades-
<A NAME="122"></A><BR><BR>"Whosoever among you hath laid low his adversary, let him mount 
<A NAME="123"></A>this hill and plant the flag that he hath won upon its crest, that the 
<A NAME="124"></A>army may learn whom we have vanquished."
<A NAME="125"></A><BR><BR>And Piran spake unto his men in like manner. Then the ten drew 
<A NAME="126"></A>up and faced one another, and each man stood opposed to the adversary that 
<A NAME="127"></A>he had chosen. Now Friburz was the first to begin combat, and he was opposed 
<A NAME="128"></A>unto Kelbad, the kinsman of Piran. And he rode at him with fury, and he 
<A NAME="129"></A>laid him low with his bow, and he galloped with joy unto the mountain and 
<A NAME="130"></A>planted the standard of Kelbad upon its crest. Then when it was done, Gew 
<A NAME="131"></A>came forward to meet his adversary, and he was placed over against Zereh, 
<A NAME="132"></A>the man whom Kai Khosrau hated because he had severed the head of Saiawush 
<A NAME="133"></A>from its trunk. And Gew was careful not to slay him, but he threw his cord 
<A NAME="134"></A>about him and caught him in the snares and bound him. Then he took from 
<A NAME="135"></A>him his standard, and led him bound unto the mountain. And there followed 
<A NAME="136"></A>after him Gourazeh, and he too laid low his foe and planted his flag upon 
<A NAME="137"></A>the crest of the hill. And likewise did all the champions of Iran; and 
<A NAME="138"></A>when the ninth hour was ended there waved nine standards from off the hill, 
<A NAME="139"></A>and none remained to fight save only Piran and Gudarz the aged. Then Gudarz 
<A NAME="140"></A>girded him for the combat, and for a mighty space they wrestled sore, but 
<A NAME="141"></A>in the end Gudarz laid low the power of Piran.
<A NAME="142"></A><BR><BR>Now when the Iranians beheld the standard of Piran planted aloft 
<A NAME="143"></A>amid those of his champions, they were beside themselves for joy, and they 
<A NAME="144"></A>called down the blessings of Heaven upon the knight. Then a messenger was 
<A NAME="145"></A>sent to bear the tidings unto Kai Khosrau, and he took with him Zereh that 
<A NAME="146"></A>the Shah might with his own hand sever that vile head from off its trunk. 
<A NAME="147"></A>And Kai Khosrau rejoiced at the news, and he rode forth that he might visit 
<A NAME="148"></A>his army. But when he beheld the body of Piran he wept sore, and he remembered 
<A NAME="149"></A>his kindness of old, and he grieved for the man that had been to him a 
<A NAME="150"></A>father. Then he commanded that a royal tomb be raised unto Piran, and he 
<A NAME="151"></A>seated him therein upon a throne of gold, and he did unto him all reverence. 
<A NAME="152"></A>But when it was done he aided his army to beat back the men of Turan yet 
<A NAME="153"></A>again, and he caused them to sue for peace. And when they had brought forth 
<A NAME="154"></A>their armour and piled it at the feet of Kai Khosrau, he bade them depart 
<A NAME="155"></A>in peace. Then he returned with joy unto his own land, and he gave thanks 
<A NAME="156"></A>unto God for the victory that was his. But he knew also that the time of 
<A NAME="157"></A>peace could not be long, and that Afrasiyab would dream of 
<A NAME="158"></A>vengeance.
