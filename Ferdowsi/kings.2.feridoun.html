<A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A>Five hundred years did Feridoun rule the world, and might and virtue increased 
<A NAME="11"></A>in the land, and all his days he did that which was good. And he roamed 
<A NAME="12"></A>throughout the kingdom to seek out that which was open and that which was 
<A NAME="13"></A>hid, and wrong was righted at his hands. With kindness did he curb the 
<A NAME="14"></A>sway of evil. He ordered the world like to a paradise, he planted the cypress 
<A NAME="15"></A>and the rose where the wild herb had sprouted.
<A NAME="16"></A><BR><BR>Now after many years were passed there were born to him three sons, 
<A NAME="17"></A>whose mother was of the house of Jemshid. And the sons were fair of mien, 
<A NAME="18"></A>tall and strong, yet their names were not known to men, for Feridoun had 
<A NAME="19"></A>not tested their hearts. But when he beheld that they were come to years 
<A NAME="20"></A>of strength he called them about his throne and bade them search out the 
<A NAME="21"></A>King of Yemen, who had three daughters, fair as the moon, that they should 
<A NAME="22"></A>woo them unto themselves. And the sons of Feridoun did according to the 
<A NAME="23"></A>command of their father. They set forth unto Yemen, and there went with 
<A NAME="24"></A>them a host countless as the stars. And when they were come to Yemen, the 
<A NAME="25"></A>King came forth to greet them, and his train was like to the plumage of 
<A NAME="26"></A>a pheasant. Then the sons of Feridoun gained the hands of the daughters 
<A NAME="27"></A>of Serv, King of Yemen, and departed with them to their own land. And Serv 
<A NAME="28"></A>gave to his new sons much treasure laid upon the backs of camels, and umbrellas 
<A NAME="29"></A>too did he give unto them in sign of kingship.
<A NAME="30"></A><BR><BR>Now it came about that when Feridoun learned that his sons were 
<A NAME="31"></A>returning, he went forth to meet them and prove their hearts. So he took 
<A NAME="32"></A>upon him the form of a dragon that foamed at the mouth with fury, and from 
<A NAME="33"></A>whose jaws sprang mighty flames. And when his sons were come near unto 
<A NAME="34"></A>the mountain pass, he came upon them suddenly, like to a whirlwind, and 
<A NAME="35"></A>raised a cloud of dust about the place with his writhings, and his roaring 
<A NAME="36"></A>filled the air with noise. Then he threw himself upon the eldest born, 
<A NAME="37"></A>and the prince laid down his spear and said, "A wise and prudent man striveth 
<A NAME="38"></A>not with dragons." And he turned his back and fled before the monster, 
<A NAME="39"></A>and left him to fall upon his brothers. Then the dragon sprang upon the 
<A NAME="40"></A>second, and he said, "An it be that I must fight, what matter if it be 
<A NAME="41"></A>a furious lion or a knight full of valour?" So he took his bow and stretched 
<A NAME="42"></A>it. But the youngest came towards him, and seeing the dragon, said, "Thou 
<A NAME="43"></A>reptile, flee from our presence, and strut not in the path of lions. For 
<A NAME="44"></A>if thou hast heard the name of Feridoun, beware how thou doest thus, for 
<A NAME="45"></A>we are his sons, armed with spears and ready for the fight. Quit therefore, 
<A NAME="46"></A>I counsel thee, thine evil path, lest I plant upon thy head the crown of 
<A NAME="47"></A>enmity."
<A NAME="48"></A><BR><BR>Then the glorious Feridoun, when he had thus made trial of their 
<A NAME="49"></A>hearts, vanished from their sight. But presently he came again with the 
<A NAME="50"></A>face of their father, and many warriors, elephants, and cymbals were in 
<A NAME="51"></A>his train. And Feridoun bore in his hand the cow-headed mace, and the Kawanee, 
<A NAME="52"></A>the apron of Kawah, the kingly standard, was waved above his head. Now 
<A NAME="53"></A>when the sons saw their father, they alighted from their steeds and ran 
<A NAME="54"></A>to greet him, and kissed the ground before his feet. And the cymbals were 
<A NAME="55"></A>clashed, and the trumpets brayed, and sounds of rejoicing were heard around. 
<A NAME="56"></A>Then Feridoun raised his sons and kissed their foreheads, and gave unto 
<A NAME="57"></A>them honour according to their due. And when they were come to the royal 
<A NAME="58"></A>house he prayed to God that He would bless his offspring, and calling them 
<A NAME="59"></A>about him, he seated them upon thrones of splendour. Then he opened his 
<A NAME="60"></A>mouth and said unto them-
<A NAME="61"></A><BR><BR>"O my sons, listen unto the words that I shall speak. The raging 
<A NAME="62"></A>dragon whose breath was danger was but your father, who sought to test 
<A NAME="63"></A>your hearts, and having learned them gave way with joy. But now will I 
<A NAME="64"></A>give to you names such as are fitting unto men. The first-born shall be 
<A NAME="65"></A>called Silim (may thy desires be accomplished in the world!) for thou soughtest 
<A NAME="66"></A>to save thyself from the clutches of the dragon, nor didst thou hesitate 
<A NAME="67"></A>in the hour of flight. A man who fleeth neither before an elephant nor 
<A NAME="68"></A>a lion, call him rather foolhardy than brave. And the second, who from 
<A NAME="69"></A>the beginning showed his courage, which was ardent as a flame, I will call 
<A NAME="70"></A>him Tur, the courageous, whom even a mad elephant cannot daunt. But the 
<A NAME="71"></A>youngest is a man prudent and brave, who knoweth both how to haste and 
<A NAME="72"></A>how to tarry; he chose the midway between the flame and the ground, as 
<A NAME="73"></A>it beseemeth a man of counsel, and he hath proven himself brave, prudent, 
<A NAME="74"></A>and bold. Irij shall he be called, that the gate of power may be his goal, 
<A NAME="75"></A>for first did he show gentleness, but his bravery sprang forth at the hour 
<A NAME="76"></A>of danger."
<A NAME="77"></A><BR><BR>When Feridoun had thus opened his lips he called for the book wherein 
<A NAME="78"></A>are written the stars, and he searched for the planets of his sons. And 
<A NAME="79"></A>he found that Jupiter reigned in the sign of the Archer in the house of 
<A NAME="80"></A>Silim, and the sun in the Lion in that of Tur, but in the house of Irij 
<A NAME="81"></A>there reigned the moon in the Scorpion. And when he saw this he was sorrowful, 
<A NAME="82"></A>for he knew that for Irij were grief and bale held in store. Then having 
<A NAME="83"></A>read the secrets of Fate, Feridoun parted the world and gave the three 
<A NAME="84"></A>parts unto his sons in suzerainty. Roum and Khaver, which are the lands 
<A NAME="85"></A>of the setting sun, did he give unto Silim. Turan and Turkestan did he 
<A NAME="86"></A>give unto Tur, and made him master of the Turks and of China, but unto 
<A NAME="87"></A>Irij he gave Iran, with the throne of might and the crown of 
<A NAME="88"></A>supremacy.
<A NAME="89"></A><BR><BR>For many years had the sons of Feridoun sat upon their golden thrones 
<A NAME="90"></A>in happiness and peace, but evil was hidden in the bosom of Fate. For Feridoun 
<A NAME="91"></A>had grown old, and his strength inclined to the grave. And as his life 
<A NAME="92"></A>waned, the evil passions of his sons waxed stronger. The heart of Silim 
<A NAME="93"></A>was changed, and his desires turned towards evil; his soul also was steeped 
<A NAME="94"></A>in greed. And he pondered in his spirit the parting of the lands, and he 
<A NAME="95"></A>revolted thereat in his thoughts, because that the youngest bore the crown 
<A NAME="96"></A>of supremacy. Then he bade a messenger mount him upon a dromedary swift 
<A NAME="97"></A>of foot, and bear this saying unto Tur-
<A NAME="98"></A><BR><BR>"O King of Turan, thy brother greeteth thee, and may thy days be 
<A NAME="99"></A>long in the land. Tell unto me, I pray thee, for thou hast might and wisdom, 
<A NAME="100"></A>should we remain thus ever satisfied, for surely unto us, not unto Irij, 
<A NAME="101"></A>pertaineth the throne of Iran, but now is our brother set above our heads, 
<A NAME="102"></A>and should we not strive against the injustice of our father? 
<A NAME="103"></A>"
<A NAME="104"></A><BR><BR>Now. when Tur had listened to these words, his head was filled 
<A NAME="105"></A>with wind, and he spake unto the messenger and said-
<A NAME="106"></A><BR><BR>"Say unto your master, O my brother, full of courage, since our 
<A NAME="107"></A>father deceived us when we were young and void of guile, with his own hands 
<A NAME="108"></A>hath he planted a tree whence must issue fruit of blood and leaves that 
<A NAME="109"></A>are poison. Let us therefore meet and take counsel together how we may 
<A NAME="110"></A>rid us of our evil fate."
<A NAME="111"></A><BR><BR>When Silim heard this he set forth from Roum, and Tur also quitted 
<A NAME="112"></A>China, and they met to counsel together how they should act. Then they 
<A NAME="113"></A>sent a messenger unto Feridoun the glorious, and they 
<A NAME="114"></A>said-
<A NAME="115"></A><BR><BR>"O King, aged and great, fearest thou not to go home unto thy God? 
<A NAME="116"></A>for evil hast thou done, and injustice dost thou leave behind thee. Thy 
<A NAME="117"></A>realm hast thou allotted with iniquity, and thine eldest born hast thou 
<A NAME="118"></A>treated with disfavour. But we thy sons entreat thee that ere it be too 
<A NAME="119"></A>late thou listen to our voice. Command thou Irij to step down from the 
<A NAME="120"></A>throne of Iran, and hide him in some corner of the earth, that he be weak 
<A NAME="121"></A>and forgotten like ourselves. Yet if thou doest not our bidding, we will 
<A NAME="122"></A>bring forth riders from Turkestan and Khaver filled with vengeance, and 
<A NAME="123"></A>will utterly destroy Irij and the land of Iran."
<A NAME="124"></A><BR><BR>When Feridoun had listened to these hard words he was angered, 
<A NAME="125"></A>and straightway said-
<A NAME="126"></A><BR><BR>"Speak unto these men, senseless and impure, these sons of Ahriman, 
<A NAME="127"></A>perverse of heart, and say unto them, Feridoun rejoiceth that ye have laid 
<A NAME="128"></A>bare before him your hearts, for now he knoweth what manner of men ye are. 
<A NAME="129"></A>And he answereth unto you that he hath parted his realm with equity. Many 
<A NAME="130"></A>counsellors did he seek, and night and day did they ponder it, and gave 
<A NAME="131"></A>unto each that which seemed best in their sight. And he now speaketh unto 
<A NAME="132"></A>you a word that he doth bid you treasure in your hearts, As ye sow, so 
<A NAME="133"></A>also shall ye reap, for there is for us another, an eternal home. And this 
<A NAME="134"></A>is the rede sent unto you by an aged man, that he who betrayeth his brother 
<A NAME="135"></A>for greed is not worthy to be sprung from a noble race. So pray unto God 
<A NAME="136"></A>that He turn your hearts from evil."
<A NAME="137"></A><BR><BR>When the messenger had heard these words he departed. Then Feridoun 
<A NAME="138"></A>called Irij before him and warned him against the craft of his brethren, 
<A NAME="139"></A>and bade him prepare an army and go forth to meet them. But Irij, when 
<A NAME="140"></A>he had heard of the evil thoughts of his brothers, was moved, and 
<A NAME="141"></A>said-
<A NAME="142"></A><BR><BR>"Not so, O my father, suffer that I go forth alone and speak unto 
<A NAME="143"></A>my brethren, that I may still the anger that they feel against me. And 
<A NAME="144"></A>I will entreat them that they put not their trust in the glory of this 
<A NAME="145"></A>world, and will recall unto them the name of Jemshid, and how that his 
<A NAME="146"></A>end was evil because that he was uplifted in his heart."
<A NAME="147"></A><BR><BR>Then Feridoun answered and said, "Go forth, my son, if such be 
<A NAME="148"></A>thy desire. The wish of thy brethren is even unto war, but thou seekest 
<A NAME="149"></A>the paths of peace. Yet I pray thee take with thee worthy knights, and 
<A NAME="150"></A>return unto me with speed, for my life is rooted in thy 
<A NAME="151"></A>happiness."
<A NAME="152"></A><BR><BR>And he gave him a letter signed with his royal seal that he should 
<A NAME="153"></A>bear it unto the kings of Roum and China. And Feridoun wrote how that he 
<A NAME="154"></A>was old, and desired neither gold nor treasures, save only that his sons 
<A NAME="155"></A>should be united. And he commended unto them his youngest born, who was 
<A NAME="156"></A>descended from his throne and come forth to meet them with peace in his 
<A NAME="157"></A>heart.
<A NAME="158"></A><BR><BR>Now when Irij was come to the spot where his brethren were encamped, 
<A NAME="159"></A>the army saw him and was filled with wonder at his beauty and at his kingly 
<A NAME="160"></A>form, and they murmured among themselves, saying, "Surely this one alone 
<A NAME="161"></A>is worthy to bear the sceptre." But when Silim and Tur heard this murmur 
<A NAME="162"></A>their anger was deepened, and they retreated into their tents, and all 
<A NAME="163"></A>night long did they hold counsel how they might do hurt unto their 
<A NAME="164"></A>brother.
<A NAME="165"></A><BR><BR>Now when the curtain that hid the sun was lifted, the brethren 
<A NAME="166"></A>went forth unto the tents of Irij. And Irij would have greeted them, but 
<A NAME="167"></A>they suffered him not, but straightway began to question him, and heap 
<A NAME="168"></A>reproaches upon his head. And Tur said-
<A NAME="169"></A><BR><BR>"Why hast thou uplifted thyself above us, and is it meet that thy 
<A NAME="170"></A>elders bow down before thee?"
<A NAME="171"></A><BR><BR>When Irij heard their words, he answered, "O Kings greedy of power, 
<A NAME="172"></A>I say unto you, if ye desire happiness, strive after peace. I covet neither 
<A NAME="173"></A>the royal crown nor the hosts of Iran; power that endeth in discord is 
<A NAME="174"></A>an honour that leadeth to tears. And I will step down from the throne of 
<A NAME="175"></A>Iran if it shall foster peace between us, for I crave not the possession 
<A NAME="176"></A>of the world if ye are afflicted by the sight. For I am humble of heart, 
<A NAME="177"></A>and my faith bids me be kind."
<A NAME="178"></A><BR><BR>Now Tur heard these words, but they softened not his spirit, for 
<A NAME="179"></A>he knew only that which is evil, and wist not that Irij spoke truly. And 
<A NAME="180"></A>he took up the chair whereon he sat and threw it at his brother in his 
<A NAME="181"></A>anger. Then Irij called for mercy at his hands, saying-
<A NAME="182"></A><BR><BR>"O King, hast thou no fear of God, no pity for thy father? I pray 
<A NAME="183"></A>thee destroy me not, lest God ask vengeance for my blood. Let it not be 
<A NAME="184"></A>spoken that thou who hast life takest that gift from others. Do not this 
<A NAME="185"></A>evil. Crush not even the tiny ant that beareth a grain of corn, for she 
<A NAME="186"></A>hath life, and sweet life is a boon. I will vanish from thy sight, I will 
<A NAME="187"></A>live in solitude and secrecy, so thou grant that I may yet behold the 
<A NAME="188"></A>sun."
<A NAME="189"></A><BR><BR>But these words angered Tur only the more, and he drew from his 
<A NAME="190"></A>boot a dagger that was poisoned and sharp, and he thrust it into the breast 
<A NAME="191"></A>of Irij, the kingly cedar. And the young lord of the world paled and was 
<A NAME="192"></A>dead. Then Tur cut the head from the trunk, and filled it with musk and 
<A NAME="193"></A>ambergris, and sent it unto the old man his father, who had parted the 
<A NAME="194"></A>world, saying-
<A NAME="195"></A><BR><BR>"Behold the head of thy darling, give unto him now the crown and 
<A NAME="196"></A>the throne."
<A NAME="197"></A><BR><BR>And when they had done this evil deed the brethren furled their 
<A NAME="198"></A>tents, and turned them back again unto the lands of Roum and 
<A NAME="199"></A>Cathay.
<A NAME="200"></A><BR><BR>Now Feridoun held his eyes fastened upon the road whither Irij 
<A NAME="201"></A>was gone, and his heart yearned after him. And when he heard that the time 
<A NAME="202"></A>of his return was come, he bade a host go forth to meet him, and he himself 
<A NAME="203"></A>went in the wake. Now when they were gone but a little way they beheld 
<A NAME="204"></A>a mighty cloud of dust upon the sky. And the cloud neared, and there came 
<A NAME="205"></A>thence a dromedary whereon was seated a knight clad in the garb of woe. 
<A NAME="206"></A>And he bare in his arms a casket of gold, and in the casket were rich stuffs 
<A NAME="207"></A>of silk, and in the stuffs was wrapped the head of Irij. And when Feridoun 
<A NAME="208"></A>beheld the face of the messenger his heart was smote with fear, but when 
<A NAME="209"></A>he saw the head of his son he fell from his horse with sorrow. Then a cry 
<A NAME="210"></A>of wailing rent the air, and the army shouted for grief, and the flags 
<A NAME="211"></A>were torn, and the drums broken, and the elephants and cymbals hung with 
<A NAME="212"></A>the colours of mourning, because that Irij was gone from the world. And 
<A NAME="213"></A>Feridoun returned on foot unto the city, and all the nobles went with him, 
<A NAME="214"></A>and they retraced their steps in the dust. Now when they were come to the 
<A NAME="215"></A>garden of Irij, Feridoun faltered in his sorrow, and he pressed the head 
<A NAME="216"></A>of the young King, his son, unto his breast. And he cast black earth upon 
<A NAME="217"></A>his throne, and tore his hair, and shed tears, and his cries mounted even 
<A NAME="218"></A>unto the seventh sphere. And he spake in his grief and 
<A NAME="219"></A>said-
<A NAME="220"></A><BR><BR>"O Master of the world, that metest out justice, look down, I pray 
<A NAME="221"></A>thee, upon this innocent whom his brethren have foully murdered! Sear their 
<A NAME="222"></A>hearts that joy cannot enter, and grant unto me my prayer. Suffer that 
<A NAME="223"></A>I may live until a hero, a warrior mighty to avenge, be sprung from the 
<A NAME="224"></A>seed of Irij. Then when I shall have beheld his face I will go hence as 
<A NAME="225"></A>it beseemeth me and the earth shall cover my body."
<A NAME="226"></A><BR><BR>Thus wept Feridoun in the bitterness of his soul, neither would 
<A NAME="227"></A>he take comfort day and night, nor quit the garden of his son. And the 
<A NAME="228"></A>earth was his couch and the dust his bed, and he watered the ground with 
<A NAME="229"></A>his tears. And he rested in this spot till that the grass was grown above 
<A NAME="230"></A>his bosom, and his eyes were blinded with weeping. Yet his tongue did not 
<A NAME="231"></A>cease from plaining and his heart from sorrow. And he cried 
<A NAME="232"></A>continually-
<A NAME="233"></A><BR><BR>"O Irij, O my son, my son, never prince died a death like thine! 
<A NAME="234"></A>Thy head was severed by Ahriman, thy body torn by lions."
<A NAME="235"></A><BR><BR>Thus mourned Feridoun, and the voice of lamentation was 
<A NAME="236"></A>abroad.
<A NAME="237"></A><BR>Then it came about that after many years had passed Feridoun bethought 
<A NAME="238"></A>him of the daughter of Irij, and how that men said she was fair. And he 
<A NAME="239"></A>sought for her in the house of the women; and when he learned that she 
<A NAME="240"></A>was fair indeed, he desired that a husband be found for her, and he wedded 
<A NAME="241"></A>her unto Pescheng, who was a hero of the race of Jemshid. And there was 
<A NAME="242"></A>born unto them a son fair and strong, worthy the throne. And when he was 
<A NAME="243"></A>yet but a tender babe they brought him to Feridoun and 
<A NAME="244"></A>cried-
<A NAME="245"></A><BR><BR>"O Lord of earth, let thy soul rejoice, behold this 
<A NAME="246"></A>Irij!"
<A NAME="247"></A><BR>Then the lips of Feridoun were wreathed with smiles, and he took up 
<A NAME="248"></A>the infant in his arms and cried unto God, saying-
<A NAME="249"></A><BR><BR>"O God, grant that my sight be restored unto me, that I may behold 
<A NAME="250"></A>the face of this babe."
<A NAME="251"></A><BR><BR>And as he prayed his eyes were opened, and his sight rested upon 
<A NAME="252"></A>his son. Then Feridoun gave thanks unto God. And he called down blessings 
<A NAME="253"></A>upon the child, and prayed that the day might be blessed also, and the 
<A NAME="254"></A>heart of his enemies be torn with anguish. And he named him Minuchihr, 
<A NAME="255"></A>saying, "A branch worthy of a noble stock hath borne fruit." And the child 
<A NAME="256"></A>was reared in the house of Feridoun, and he suffered not that ill came 
<A NAME="257"></A>near unto him, and though the years passed above his head the stars brought 
<A NAME="258"></A>him no evil. And when he was of a ripe age Feridoun gave to Minuchihr a 
<A NAME="259"></A>throne of gold, and a mace, and a crown of jewels, and the key to all his 
<A NAME="260"></A>treasures. Then he commanded his nobles that they should do him reverence 
<A NAME="261"></A>and salute him king. And there were gathered about the throne Karun, the 
<A NAME="262"></A>son of Kawah, and Serv, King of Yemen, and Guerschasp the victorious, and 
<A NAME="263"></A>many other mighty princes more than tongue can name. But the young Shah 
<A NAME="264"></A>outshone them in strength and beauty, and joy was once more in the 
<A NAME="265"></A>land.
<A NAME="266"></A><BR><BR>But tidings of the splendour that surrounded Feridoun pierced even 
<A NAME="267"></A>unto the lands of Roum and China, and the kings thereof were troubled and 
<A NAME="268"></A>downcast in their hearts. Then they conferred how they should regain the 
<A NAME="269"></A>favour of the Shah, for they feared Minuchihr when he should be come unto 
<A NAME="270"></A>years of might. So they sent a messenger unto Feridoun bearing rich gifts, 
<A NAME="271"></A>and bade him speak unto their father and say-
<A NAME="272"></A><BR><BR>"O Shah, live for ever I bear a message from the humblest of thy 
<A NAME="273"></A>slaves, who are bowed unto the earth with contrition, wherefore they have 
<A NAME="274"></A>not ventured into thy presence. And they pray that thou pardon their evil 
<A NAME="275"></A>deed, for their hearts are good, and they did it not of themselves, but 
<A NAME="276"></A>because it was written that they should do this wrong, and that which is 
<A NAME="277"></A>written in the stars surely it is accomplished. And therefore, O King, 
<A NAME="278"></A>their eyes are filled with tears, and they pray thee incline unto them 
<A NAME="279"></A>thine ear. And as a sign of thy grace send unto them Minuchihr thy son, 
<A NAME="280"></A>for their hearts yearn to look upon his face and do him 
<A NAME="281"></A>homage."
<A NAME="282"></A><BR><BR>Now when Feridoun had listened to the words of his sons, he knitted 
<A NAME="283"></A>his brows in anger, for he knew that they sought only to beguile him. And 
<A NAME="284"></A>he said unto the messenger-
<A NAME="285"></A><BR><BR>"Go, say unto your masters that their false-hearted words shall 
<A NAME="286"></A>avail them nothing. And ask them if they be not shamed to utter white words 
<A NAME="287"></A>with tongues of blackness. I have heard their message, hear now the answer 
<A NAME="288"></A>that I send. Ye say unto me that ye desire the love of Minuchihr, and I 
<A NAME="289"></A>ask of you, What did ye for Irij? And now that ye are delivered of him 
<A NAME="290"></A>ye seek the blood of his son. Verily I say unto you, never shall ye look 
<A NAME="291"></A>upon his face save when he leadeth a mighty army. Then shall be watered 
<A NAME="292"></A>with blood the leaves and fruits of the tree sprung from the vengeance 
<A NAME="293"></A>that is due. For unto this day hath vengeance slumbered, since it became 
<A NAME="294"></A>me not to stretch forth mine hand in battle upon my sons; but now is there 
<A NAME="295"></A>sprung a branch from the tree which the enemy uprooted, and he shall come 
<A NAME="296"></A>as a raging lion, girt with the vengeance of his sire. And I say unto you, 
<A NAME="297"></A>take back the treasures ye have sent me, for think ye that for coloured 
<A NAME="298"></A>toys I will abandon my vengeance, and efface for baubles the blood that 
<A NAME="299"></A>ye have spilled, or sell for gold the head of mine offspring? And say yet 
<A NAME="300"></A>again that while the father of Irij lives he will not abandon his intent. 
<A NAME="301"></A>And now that thou hast listened unto my message, lay it up in thy heart 
<A NAME="302"></A>and make haste from hence."
<A NAME="303"></A><BR><BR>When the messenger had heard these words he departed with speed. 
<A NAME="304"></A>And when he was come unto Silim and Tur he told them thereof, and how he 
<A NAME="305"></A>had seen Minuchihr sitting upon a throne of gold, and how for strength 
<A NAME="306"></A>he was like unto Tahumers, who had bound the Deevs. And he told how heroes 
<A NAME="307"></A>bearing names that filled the world with wonder stood round about him, 
<A NAME="308"></A>Kawah the smith, and Karun his son, and Serv, the King of Yemen, and next 
<A NAME="309"></A>in might unto the Shah was Saum, the son of Neriman, the unvanquished in 
<A NAME="310"></A>fight, and Guerschasp the victorious, his treasurer. Then he spake of the 
<A NAME="311"></A>treasures that filled the house of Feridoun, and of the army great in number, 
<A NAME="312"></A>so that the men of Roum and China could not stand against them. And he 
<A NAME="313"></A>told how their hearts were filled with hatred of the Kings because of 
<A NAME="314"></A>Irij.
<A NAME="315"></A><BR><BR>The Kings, when they heard this and the message of their father, 
<A NAME="316"></A>trembled for fear. And Tur said unto Silim-
<A NAME="317"></A><BR><BR>"Henceforth we must forego pleasure, for it behoveth us to hasten, 
<A NAME="318"></A>and not tarry till the teeth of this young lion be sharpened, and he be 
<A NAME="319"></A>waxed tall and strong."
<A NAME="320"></A><BR><BR>Then they made ready their armies, and the number of their men 
<A NAME="321"></A>was past the counting. Helmet was joined to helmet, and spear to spear, 
<A NAME="322"></A>and jewels, baggage, and elephants without number went with them, and you 
<A NAME="323"></A>would have said it was a host that none could understand. And they marched 
<A NAME="324"></A>from Turan into Iran, and the two Kings rode before them, their hearts 
<A NAME="325"></A>filled with hate. But the star of these evil ones was sinking. For Feridoun, 
<A NAME="326"></A>when he learned that an army had crossed the Jihun, called unto him Minuchihr 
<A NAME="327"></A>his son, and bade him place himself at the head of the warriors. And the 
<A NAME="328"></A>host of the Shah was mighty to behold, great and strong, and it covered 
<A NAME="329"></A>the land like unto a cloud of locusts. And they marched from Temmische 
<A NAME="330"></A>unto the desert, and Minuchihr commanded them with might. And on his right 
<A NAME="331"></A>rode Karun the Avenger, and on his left Saum, the son of Neriman, and above 
<A NAME="332"></A>their heads waved the flag of Kawah, and their armour glistened in the 
<A NAME="333"></A>sun. Like as a lion breaketh forth from the jungle to seize upon his prey, 
<A NAME="334"></A>so did this army rush forth to avenge the death of Irij. And the head of 
<A NAME="335"></A>Minuchihr rose above the rest like to the moon or the sun when it shineth 
<A NAME="336"></A>above the mountains. And he exhorted them in words of fire that they rest 
<A NAME="337"></A>not, neither weary, until they should have broken the power of these sons 
<A NAME="338"></A>of Ahriman.
<A NAME="339"></A><BR><BR>Now Tur and Silim, when they saw that the Iranians were come out 
<A NAME="340"></A>against them, set in order their army. And when the day had torn asunder 
<A NAME="341"></A>the folds of night, the two armies met in battle, and the fight waged strong 
<A NAME="342"></A>until the setting of the sun. And the earth was a sea of blood, and the 
<A NAME="343"></A>feet of the elephants were like to pillars of coral. And when the sun was 
<A NAME="344"></A>sunk to his rest, Tur and Silim consulted how they might seize upon Minuchihr 
<A NAME="345"></A>by fraud, for they saw that his arm was strong and his courage undaunted. 
<A NAME="346"></A>So Tur set forth at the head of a small band to surprise him in his tents. 
<A NAME="347"></A>But Minuchihr was aware of his evil plans, and sprang upon him. And when 
<A NAME="348"></A>Tur would have fled Minuchihr followed after him and struck a lance into 
<A NAME="349"></A>his back. And when he had killed him he cut his head from his trunk, and 
<A NAME="350"></A>the body did he give unto the wild beasts, but the head he sent to Feridoun. 
<A NAME="351"></A>And he wrote to him and sent him greeting, and told him all that was come 
<A NAME="352"></A>about, and how he should neither rest nor tarry until the death of Irij 
<A NAME="353"></A>be avenged.
<A NAME="354"></A><BR><BR>Now Silim, when he learned the fate of his brother, was sore afraid, 
<A NAME="355"></A>and cast about him for an ally. And there came unto him Kakoui, of the 
<A NAME="356"></A>seed of Zohak. But Minuchihr wrestled with him for a morning's space and 
<A NAME="357"></A>overcame him also, though the Deev was strong and powerful in fight. Then 
<A NAME="358"></A>Silim was cast down yet more, and he sought to hide him by the sea-shore. 
<A NAME="359"></A>But Minuchihr cut off his path and overtook him, and with his own hand 
<A NAME="360"></A>he slew him, and cut his head from his trunk. And he raised the head upon 
<A NAME="361"></A>his lance. And when the army of Silim saw this they fled into the hills, 
<A NAME="362"></A>and vanished like cattle whom the snow hath driven from their pasture. 
<A NAME="363"></A>Then they took counsel and chose out a man from among their midst, one 
<A NAME="364"></A>that was prudent and gentle of speech. And they bade him go before the 
<A NAME="365"></A>Shah and say-
<A NAME="366"></A><BR><BR>"Have mercy upon us, O Shah, for neither hate nor vengeance drove 
<A NAME="367"></A>us forth against thee, but only this, that we obeyed the wills of our lords. 
<A NAME="368"></A>But we ourselves are peaceful men, tillers of the earth and keepers of 
<A NAME="369"></A>cattle, and we pray thee that thou let us return in safety whence we are 
<A NAME="370"></A>come. And we acknowledge thee our Shah, and we pray thee make thy servants 
<A NAME="371"></A>acquainted with thy desires."
<A NAME="372"></A><BR><BR>When Minuchihr had heard these words he spake and 
<A NAME="373"></A>said-
<A NAME="374"></A><BR>"My desire is not after these men, neither is my longing after blood 
<A NAME="375"></A>but mercy. Let every man lay down his arms and go his ways, and let peace 
<A NAME="376"></A>be in the land, and joy wait upon your feet."
<A NAME="377"></A><BR><BR>When the men heard this they praised the Shah, and called down 
<A NAME="378"></A>blessings upon his head. And they came before him, every man bearing his 
<A NAME="379"></A>armour and the weapons of battle. And they laid them at his feet, and of 
<A NAME="380"></A>weapons there was reared a mighty mountain, and the blue steel glistened 
<A NAME="381"></A>in the sun. Then Minuchihr dismissed them graciously. And when the army 
<A NAME="382"></A>was dispersed he sent a messenger unto Feridoun bearing the head of Silim 
<A NAME="383"></A>and a writing. And when he had ordered all things he set out at the head 
<A NAME="384"></A>of his warriors unto the city of Feridoun. And his grandsire came forth 
<A NAME="385"></A>to meet him, and there came with him many elephants swathed in gold, and 
<A NAME="386"></A>warriors arrayed in rich attire, and a large multitude clad in garments 
<A NAME="387"></A>of bright hue. And flags waved above them, and trumpets brayed, and cymbals 
<A NAME="388"></A>clashed, and sounds of rejoicing filled the air. But when Minuchihr saw 
<A NAME="389"></A>that his grandsire came towards him, he got from his horse and ran to meet 
<A NAME="390"></A>him, and fell at his feet and craved his blessing. And Feridoun blessed 
<A NAME="391"></A>Minuchihr and raised him from the dust. And he bade him sit again upon 
<A NAME="392"></A>his horse and took his hand, and they entered the city in triumph. And 
<A NAME="393"></A>when they were come to the King's house, Feridoun seated Minuchihr upon 
<A NAME="394"></A>a throne of gold. Then he called unto him Saum, the son of Neriman, and 
<A NAME="395"></A>said-
<A NAME="396"></A><BR><BR>"I pray thee bring up this youth and nourish him for the kingdom, 
<A NAME="397"></A>and aid him with thy might and mind."
<A NAME="398"></A><BR><BR>And he took the hand of Minuchihr and put it into that of Saum, 
<A NAME="399"></A>and said-
<A NAME="400"></A><BR><BR>"Thanks be unto God the merciful, who hath listened unto my voice, 
<A NAME="401"></A>and granted the desires of His servant. For now shall I go hence, and the 
<A NAME="402"></A>world will I cumber no more."
<A NAME="403"></A><BR><BR>Then when he had given gifts unto his servants he withdrew into 
<A NAME="404"></A>solitude, and gazed without cease upon the heads of his sons, neither refrained 
<A NAME="405"></A>he from bewailing their evil fate, and the sorrow they had brought upon 
<A NAME="406"></A>him. And daily he grew fainter, and at last the light of his life expired, 
<A NAME="407"></A>and Feridoun vanished from the earth, but his name remained behind him. 
<A NAME="408"></A>And Minuchihr mourned for his grandsire with weeping and lamentation, and 
<A NAME="409"></A>raised above him a stately tomb. But when the seven days of mourning were 
<A NAME="410"></A>ended, he put upon his head the crown of the Kaianides, and girt his loins 
<A NAME="411"></A>with a red sash of might. And the nation called him Shah, and he was beloved 
<A NAME="412"></A>in the land.
