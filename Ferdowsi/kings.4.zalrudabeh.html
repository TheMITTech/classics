<A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A>Anon it came about that Zal desired to see the kingdom. And he set forth, 
<A NAME="11"></A>and there followed after him a goodly train, and when they had journeyed 
<A NAME="12"></A>a while they marched with pomp into Cabul. Now Mihrab, who was descended 
<A NAME="13"></A>from Zohak the Serpent, reigned in Cabul, yet he was worthy, prudent, and 
<A NAME="14"></A>wise. When he heard that the son of Saum, to whom he paid tribute, drew 
<A NAME="15"></A>nigh unto the city, he went out to meet him, and his nobles went with him, 
<A NAME="16"></A>and slaves bearing costly gifts. And Zal, hearing that Mihrab was at hand, 
<A NAME="17"></A>prepared a feast in his tents, and Mihrab and his train feasted with him 
<A NAME="18"></A>until the night was far spent. Now, after the King was gone, Zal praised 
<A NAME="19"></A>his beauty. Then a noble rose up and said unto him-
<A NAME="20"></A><BR><BR>"O Zal, thou knowest not beauty since thou hast not beheld the 
<A NAME="21"></A>daughter of this man. For she is like unto the slender cypress, her face 
<A NAME="22"></A>is brighter than the sun, her mouth is a pomegranate 
<A NAME="23"></A>flower."
<A NAME="24"></A><BR><BR>When Zal heard these words he was filled with longing, and sleep 
<A NAME="25"></A>would not visit his eyelids for thinking of her beauty.
<A NAME="26"></A><BR><BR>Now, when the day dawned, he opened the doors of his court, and 
<A NAME="27"></A>the nobles stood about him, each man according to his rank. And presently 
<A NAME="28"></A>there came from Cabul Mihrab the King to tender morning greeting to the 
<A NAME="29"></A>stranger without his gates. And Zal desired that Mihrab should crave a 
<A NAME="30"></A>boon at his hands. Then spake Mihrab unto him saying-
<A NAME="31"></A><BR><BR>"O ruler mighty and great, I have but one desire, and to bring 
<A NAME="32"></A>it to pass is easy. For I crave thee that thou dwell as guest beneath my 
<A NAME="33"></A>roof, and let my heart rejoice in thy presence."
<A NAME="34"></A><BR><BR>Then Zal said unto him, "O King, ask not this boon at my hands, 
<A NAME="35"></A>I pray thee, for it can in nowise be accomplished. The Shah and Saum would 
<A NAME="36"></A>be angered should they learn that I had eaten under the roof of Zohak. 
<A NAME="37"></A>I beg of thee ask aught but this."
<A NAME="38"></A><BR><BR>When Mihrab heard these words he was sorrowful, and bent low before 
<A NAME="39"></A>Zal, and departed from out the tents. And the eye of Zal looked after him, 
<A NAME="40"></A>and yet again he spake his praises. Then he bethought him of the King's 
<A NAME="41"></A>daughter, and how that she was fair, and he was sunk in brooding and desire, 
<A NAME="42"></A>and the days passed unheeded over his head.
<A NAME="43"></A><BR><BR>Now it came to pass that on a certain morning Mihrab stepped forth 
<A NAME="44"></A>from his palace to the house of the women to visit Sindokht his wife, and 
<A NAME="45"></A>her daughter Rudabeh. Truly the house was like to a garden for colour and 
<A NAME="46"></A>perfume, and over all shone those moons of beauty. Now when Mihrab had 
<A NAME="47"></A>greeted Rudabeh he marvelled at her loveliness, and called down the blessings 
<A NAME="48"></A>of Heaven upon her head. Then Sindokht opened her lips and questioned Mihrab 
<A NAME="49"></A>concerning the stranger whose tents were without their gates. And she 
<A NAME="50"></A>said-
<A NAME="51"></A><BR><BR>"I pray thee tell unto me what manner of man is this white-haired 
<A NAME="52"></A>son of Saum, and is he worthy the nest or the throne? 
<A NAME="53"></A>"
<A NAME="54"></A><BR><BR>Then Mihrab said unto her, "O my fair cypress, the son of Saum 
<A NAME="55"></A>is a hero among men. His heart is like unto a lion's, his strength is as 
<A NAME="56"></A>an elephant's, to his friends he is a gracious Nile, unto his enemies a 
<A NAME="57"></A>wasting crocodile. And in him are even blemishes turned to beauties, his 
<A NAME="58"></A>white locks but enhance his glory."
<A NAME="59"></A><BR><BR>When Rudabeh had listened to these words her heart burned with 
<A NAME="60"></A>love for Zal, so that she could neither eat nor rest, and was like unto 
<A NAME="61"></A>one that hath changed her shape. And after a while, because that she could 
<A NAME="62"></A>bear the burden thereof no longer, she told her secret to the slaves that 
<A NAME="63"></A>loved and served her. And she charged them tell no man, and entreated of 
<A NAME="64"></A>them that they would aid her to allay the troubles of her heart. And when 
<A NAME="65"></A>the slaves had listened to her story, they were filled with fear, and with 
<A NAME="66"></A>one accord entreated her that she would dismiss from her heart one branded 
<A NAME="67"></A>among men, and whom his own father had cast out. But Rudabeh would not 
<A NAME="68"></A>listen to their voice. And when they beheld that she was firm in her spirit, 
<A NAME="69"></A>and that their words were vain, they cast about how they might serve her. 
<A NAME="70"></A>And one among them who was wise above the rest opened her lips and 
<A NAME="71"></A>spake-
<A NAME="72"></A><BR><BR>"O moon-faced beauty, slender cypress, it shall be done at thy 
<A NAME="73"></A>desire. Thy slaves will neither rest nor slumber until the royal youth 
<A NAME="74"></A>shall have become the footstool to thy feet."
<A NAME="75"></A><BR><BR>Then Rudabeh was glad and said-
<A NAME="76"></A><BR>"An the issue be happy, there shall be planted for thee a noble tree, 
<A NAME="77"></A>and it shall bear riches and jewels, and wisdom shall cull its 
<A NAME="78"></A>fruits."
<A NAME="79"></A><BR><BR>Then the slaves pondered in their hearts how they should compass 
<A NAME="80"></A>their end, for they knew that only by craft could it be brought about. 
<A NAME="81"></A>Straightway they clothed themselves in costly raiment, and went forth blithely 
<A NAME="82"></A>into the garden of flowers that was spread beside the river's bank without 
<A NAME="83"></A>the city. And they gathered roses, and decked their hair with blossoms, 
<A NAME="84"></A>and threw them into the stream for sooth-telling; and as they gathered 
<A NAME="85"></A>they came unto the spot over against which were pitched the tents of Zal. 
<A NAME="86"></A>Now Zal beheld them from his tent, and he questioned them concerning these 
<A NAME="87"></A>rose-gatherers. And one uprose and said unto him-
<A NAME="88"></A><BR><BR>"They are slaves sent forth by the moon of Cabul into the garden 
<A NAME="89"></A>of flowers."
<A NAME="90"></A><BR><BR>Now when Zal heard this his heart leaped for joy, and he set forth 
<A NAME="91"></A>unto the river's bank with only one page to bear him company. And seeing 
<A NAME="92"></A>a water-bird fly upwards, he took his bow and shot it through the heart, 
<A NAME="93"></A>and it fell among the rose-gatherers. Then Zal bade the boy cross the water 
<A NAME="94"></A>and bring him the bird. And when he had landed, the moon-faced women pressed 
<A NAME="95"></A>about him and questioned him, saying-
<A NAME="96"></A><BR><BR>"O youth, tell us the name of him who aimeth thus surely, for verily 
<A NAME="97"></A>he is a king among men."
<A NAME="98"></A><BR><BR>Then the boy answering said, "What! know ye not the son of Saum 
<A NAME="99"></A>the hero? The world hath not his equal for strength and 
<A NAME="100"></A>beauty."
<A NAME="101"></A><BR><BR>But the girls reproved him, and said, "Not so, boast not thus vainly, 
<A NAME="102"></A>for the house of Mihrab holdeth a sun that o'ershines all 
<A NAME="103"></A>besides."
<A NAME="104"></A><BR><BR>And the page smiled, and the smile yet lingered on his lips when 
<A NAME="105"></A>he came back to Zal. And Zal said-
<A NAME="106"></A><BR><BR>"Why smilest thou, boy? What have they spoken unto thee that thou 
<A NAME="107"></A>openest thy lips and showest thy ivory teeth? "
<A NAME="108"></A><BR><BR>Then the boy told unto him the speech of the women. And Zal 
<A NAME="109"></A>said-
<A NAME="110"></A><BR>"Go over yet again and bid them tarry, that they may bear back jewels 
<A NAME="111"></A>with their roses."
<A NAME="112"></A><BR><BR>And he chose forth from among his treasures trinkets of pearl and 
<A NAME="113"></A>gold, and sent them to the slaves. Then the one who had sworn to serve 
<A NAME="114"></A>Rudabeh above the rest craved that she might look upon the face of the 
<A NAME="115"></A>hero, for she said-
<A NAME="116"></A><BR><BR>"A secret that is known to three is one no longer."
<A NAME="117"></A><BR>And Zal granted her desire, and she told him of Rudabeh and of her 
<A NAME="118"></A>beauty, and his passion burned the more. And he spake-
<A NAME="119"></A><BR><BR>"Show unto me, I pray thee, the path by which I may behold this 
<A NAME="120"></A>fair one, for my heart is filled with longing."
<A NAME="121"></A><BR><BR>Then the slave said, "Suffer that we go back to the house of the 
<A NAME="122"></A>women, and we will fill the ears of Rudabeh with praises of the son of 
<A NAME="123"></A>Saum, and will entangle her in the meshes of our net, and the lion shall 
<A NAME="124"></A>rejoice in his chase of the lamb."
<A NAME="125"></A><BR><BR>Then Zal bade her go forth, and the women returned to the house 
<A NAME="126"></A>rejoicing and saying-
<A NAME="127"></A><BR><BR>"The lion entereth the snare spread forth to entrap him, and the 
<A NAME="128"></A>wishes of Rudabeh and Zal will be accomplished."
<A NAME="129"></A><BR><BR>But when they were come to the gates the porter chid them that 
<A NAME="130"></A>they were gone without while the stranger sojourned in Cabul, and they 
<A NAME="131"></A>were troubled and sore afraid for their secret. But they stilled his wrath 
<A NAME="132"></A>and came unto where Rudabeh awaited them. And they told her of Zal, the 
<A NAME="133"></A>son of Saum, and of his beauty and his prowess. And Rudabeh smiled and 
<A NAME="134"></A>said-
<A NAME="135"></A><BR><BR>"Wherefore have ye thus changed your note? For a while back ye 
<A NAME="136"></A>spake with scorn of this bird-reared youth, on whose head hang the locks 
<A NAME="137"></A>of a sage, but now are ye loud in his praises."
<A NAME="138"></A><BR><BR>Then Rudabeh began privily to deck her house that it might be worthy 
<A NAME="139"></A>a guest. With brocades of Roum and carpets of Ind did she hang it, and 
<A NAME="140"></A>she perfumed it with musk and ambergris, and flowers did she cause to bloom 
<A NAME="141"></A>about the rooms. And when the sun was sunk, and the doors of the house 
<A NAME="142"></A>were locked and the keys withdrawn, a slave went forth unto Zal, the son 
<A NAME="143"></A>of Saum. And she spake unto him in a low voice-
<A NAME="144"></A><BR><BR>"Come now, for all is ready."
<A NAME="145"></A><BR>And Zal followed after her. And when they were come to the house of 
<A NAME="146"></A>the women Zal beheld the daughter of the King standing upon the roof, and 
<A NAME="147"></A>her beauty was like unto a cypress on which the full moon shineth. And 
<A NAME="148"></A>when she beheld him, she spake and said-
<A NAME="149"></A><BR><BR>"I bid thee welcome, O young man, son of a hero, and may the blessing 
<A NAME="150"></A>of Heaven rest upon thee."
<A NAME="151"></A><BR><BR>And Zal answered her benison, and prayed that he might enter into 
<A NAME="152"></A>nearer converse, for he was on the ground and she was on the roof. Then 
<A NAME="153"></A>the Peri-faced loosened her tresses, and they were long, so that they fell 
<A NAME="154"></A>from the battlements unto the ground. And she said unto 
<A NAME="155"></A>Zal-
<A NAME="156"></A><BR><BR>"Here hast thou a cord without flaw. Mount, O Pehliva, and seize 
<A NAME="157"></A>my black locks, for it is fitting that I should be a snare unto 
<A NAME="158"></A>thee."
<A NAME="159"></A><BR><BR>But Zal cried, "Not so, O fair one, it would beseem me ill to do 
<A NAME="160"></A>thee hurt."
<A NAME="161"></A><BR><BR>And he covered her hair with kisses. Then he called for a cord 
<A NAME="162"></A>and made a running knot, and threw it upwards and fastened it to the battlements. 
<A NAME="163"></A>And with a bound he swung himself upon the roof. Then Rudabeh took his 
<A NAME="164"></A>hand and they stepped down together into the golden chambers, and the slaves 
<A NAME="165"></A>stood round about them. And they gazed upon each other and knew that they 
<A NAME="166"></A>excelled in beauty, and the hours slipped by in sweet talk, while love 
<A NAME="167"></A>was fanned in their hearts. Then Zal cried-
<A NAME="168"></A><BR><BR>"O fair cypress, musk-perfumed, when Minuchihr shall learn of this 
<A NAME="169"></A>he will be angered and Saum also will chide. And they will say I have forgotten 
<A NAME="170"></A>my God, and will lift their hands against me. But I swear unto thee that 
<A NAME="171"></A>this life is to me vile if it be not spent in thy presence. And I call 
<A NAME="172"></A>upon Heaven to hear me that none other but thee will I call my 
<A NAME="173"></A>bride."
<A NAME="174"></A><BR><BR>And Rudabeh said, "I too will swear unto thee this 
<A NAME="175"></A>oath."
<A NAME="176"></A><BR>So the hours sped, and there arose from out the tents of the King the 
<A NAME="177"></A>sound of drums that announce the coming of the day. Then cried Zal and 
<A NAME="178"></A>Rudabeh of one accord-
<A NAME="179"></A><BR><BR>"O glory of the world, tarry yet a while, neither arrive so 
<A NAME="180"></A>quickly."
<A NAME="181"></A><BR><BR>But the sun gave no ear to their reproaches, and the hour to part 
<A NAME="182"></A>was come. Then Zal swung himself from the battlements unto the ground, 
<A NAME="183"></A>and quitted the house of his beloved.
<A NAME="184"></A><BR><BR>Now when the earth was flooded with light, and the nobles and chiefs 
<A NAME="185"></A>had tendered unto Zal their morning greetings as was their wont, he called 
<A NAME="186"></A>about him his Mubids, and laid before them how that he was filled with 
<A NAME="187"></A>love for a daughter of the Serpent. And the Mubids when they heard it were 
<A NAME="188"></A>troubled, and their lips were closed, and the words were chained upon their 
<A NAME="189"></A>tongues. For there was none of them that listed to mingle poison in the 
<A NAME="190"></A>honey of this love. Whereupon Zal reproved them, and said that he would 
<A NAME="191"></A>bestow on them rich gifts if they would open their mouths. Then they spake 
<A NAME="192"></A>and said unto him that the honour of a king could not suffer by a woman, 
<A NAME="193"></A>and though Mihrab be indeed of Zohak's race, he was noble and valiant. 
<A NAME="194"></A>And they urged him to write unto his father and crave Saum to wait upon 
<A NAME="195"></A>the Shah.
<A NAME="196"></A><BR><BR>Then Zal called unto him a scribe and bade him write down the words 
<A NAME="197"></A>that he spake. And he told unto Saum his love and his fears. And he recalled 
<A NAME="198"></A>unto him how that he had cast him out, and how that he had lived in a nest, 
<A NAME="199"></A>and a bird had reared him, and the sun had poured down upon his head, and 
<A NAME="200"></A>raw flesh had been his nourishment the while his father had sat within 
<A NAME="201"></A>a goodly house clothed in silk. And he recalled the promise given to him 
<A NAME="202"></A>by Saum. Neither did he seek to justify that which was come about. Then 
<A NAME="203"></A>he gave the letter to a messenger, and bade him ride until he should be 
<A NAME="204"></A>come into the presence of Saum.
<A NAME="205"></A><BR><BR>When Saum had heard the words of his son his spirit was troubled, 
<A NAME="206"></A>and he cried-
<A NAME="207"></A><BR><BR>"Woe unto me, for now is clear what hath so long been hidden. One 
<A NAME="208"></A>whom a wild bird hath reared looketh for the fulfilment of wild desires, 
<A NAME="209"></A>and seeks union with an accursed race."
<A NAME="210"></A><BR><BR>And he pondered long what he should answer. For he said, "If I 
<A NAME="211"></A>say, Abandon this desire, sow no discord, return to reason, I break my 
<A NAME="212"></A>oath and God will punish me. Yet if I say, Thy desire is just, satisfy 
<A NAME="213"></A>the passions of thy heart, what offspring can come to pass from the union 
<A NAME="214"></A>of a Deev and the nursling of a bird?"
<A NAME="215"></A><BR><BR>And the heart of Saum was heavy with care. So he called unto him 
<A NAME="216"></A>his Mubids that they should search the stars, for he 
<A NAME="217"></A>said-
<A NAME="218"></A><BR><BR>"If I mingle fire and water I do ill, and ill will come of 
<A NAME="219"></A>it."
<A NAME="220"></A><BR>Then all that day the Wise Men searched the secrets of Fate, and they 
<A NAME="221"></A>cast the horoscope of Zal and Rudabeh, and at even they returned to the 
<A NAME="222"></A>King rejoicing. And they found him torn with anguish. Then they 
<A NAME="223"></A>said-
<A NAME="224"></A><BR><BR>"Hail unto thee, O Saum, for we have followed the movement of the 
<A NAME="225"></A>stars and counted their course, and we have read the message of the skies. 
<A NAME="226"></A>And it is written, 'A clear spring shall issue into the day, a son shall 
<A NAME="227"></A>be born to Zal, a hero full of power and glory, and there shall not be 
<A NAME="228"></A>his like in Iran.' "
<A NAME="229"></A><BR><BR>Now when Saum had drunk in these words, his soul was uplifted, 
<A NAME="230"></A>and he poured gifts upon the Mubids. Then he called to him the messenger 
<A NAME="231"></A>of Zal, and he gave him pieces of silver, and bade him return unto his 
<A NAME="232"></A>master and say-
<A NAME="233"></A><BR><BR>"I hold thy passion folly, O my son, but because of the oath that 
<A NAME="234"></A>I have sworn to thee it shall be done at thy desire. I will hie me unto 
<A NAME="235"></A>Iran and lay thy suit before the Shah."
<A NAME="236"></A><BR><BR>Then Saum called together his army and set forth for Iran, and 
<A NAME="237"></A>the sound of trumpets and cymbals went before him.
<A NAME="238"></A><BR><BR>Now when the messenger was come back to Zal, he rejoiced and praised 
<A NAME="239"></A>God, and gave gold and silver to the poor, and gifts unto his servants. 
<A NAME="240"></A>But when night was come he could not close his eyes in slumber, nor could 
<A NAME="241"></A>he rest during the day. Neither did he drink wine nor demand the singers, 
<A NAME="242"></A>for his soul was filled with longing after his love. And presently there 
<A NAME="243"></A>came out to him a slave, and he gave unto her Saum's letter that she might 
<A NAME="244"></A>bear it to Rudabeh. And Rudabeh rejoiced also, and chose from among her 
<A NAME="245"></A>treasures a costly crown and a ring of worth, and bade the woman bear them 
<A NAME="246"></A>unto Zal. Now as she quitted the chamber she met Sindokht. And the Queen 
<A NAME="247"></A>questioned her and said-
<A NAME="248"></A><BR><BR>"Whence comest thou? Reply to all my questions, neither seek thou 
<A NAME="249"></A>to deceive me, for already a long time do I suspect thy passing to and 
<A NAME="250"></A>fro."
<A NAME="251"></A><BR><BR>And the woman trembled as she heard these words, and fell down 
<A NAME="252"></A>and kissed the feet of the Queen, and said-
<A NAME="253"></A><BR><BR>"Have pity on thine handmaiden, who is poor and gaineth her bread 
<A NAME="254"></A>as she can. I go into the houses of the rich and sell to them robes and 
<A NAME="255"></A>jewels. And Rudabeh hath this day bought of me a tiara and a bracelet of 
<A NAME="256"></A>gold."
<A NAME="257"></A><BR><BR>Then said Sindokht, "Show unto me the money thou hast received 
<A NAME="258"></A>for the same, that my anger be appeased."
<A NAME="259"></A><BR><BR>And the woman answered and said, "Demand not that I show unto thee 
<A NAME="260"></A>that which I have not, for Rudabeh will pay me to-morrow."
<A NAME="261"></A><BR><BR>Now Sindokht knew that these words were feigned, and she searched 
<A NAME="262"></A>the sleeve of the woman, and lo! she found therein the tiara that Rudabeh 
<A NAME="263"></A>had broidered with her hands. Then she was angered, and commanded that 
<A NAME="264"></A>the slave should be bound in chains. And she desired that her daughter 
<A NAME="265"></A>be brought into her presence. And when she was come, Sindokht opened her 
<A NAME="266"></A>mouth and spake, saying-
<A NAME="267"></A><BR><BR>"O moon of noble race, to whom hath been taught naught but that 
<A NAME="268"></A>which is good, how hast thou gone astray upon the paths of evil? O my daughter, 
<A NAME="269"></A>confide unto thy mother thy secrets. From whom cometh this woman? For what 
<A NAME="270"></A>man are destined thy gifts?"
<A NAME="271"></A><BR><BR>When she had heard, Rudabeh was abashed, but after a while she 
<A NAME="272"></A>told all unto Sindokht. Now when the Queen had heard she was confounded, 
<A NAME="273"></A>for she feared the wrath of the Shah, and that he would raze Cabul to the 
<A NAME="274"></A>dust for this mischance. And she went into her rooms and wept in her sorrow. 
<A NAME="275"></A>Then presently Mihrab the King came in to Sindokht, and he was of joyful 
<A NAME="276"></A>mind, for Zal had received him graciously. But when he beheld her tears 
<A NAME="277"></A>he questioned of her grief. Then she told him how that his daughter was 
<A NAME="278"></A>filled with love for Zal, the son of Saum. And when Mihrab had heard her 
<A NAME="279"></A>to an end, his heart also was troubled, for he knew that Cabul could not 
<A NAME="280"></A>stand before the Shah.
<A NAME="281"></A><BR><BR>Minuchihr, too, when he had heard these things, was troubled, for 
<A NAME="282"></A>he beheld in them the device of Ahriman, and feared lest this union should 
<A NAME="283"></A>bring evil upon Iran. And he bade Nauder call Saum before him. Now when 
<A NAME="284"></A>Saum heard the desire of the Shah, he spake and said-
<A NAME="285"></A><BR><BR>"I obey, and the sight of the King will be a banquet unto my 
<A NAME="286"></A>soul."
<A NAME="287"></A><BR><BR>Then Saum went into the presence of Minuchihr, and he kissed the 
<A NAME="288"></A>ground, and called down blessings upon the head of the Shah. But Minuchihr 
<A NAME="289"></A>raised him and seated him beside him on the throne, and straightway began 
<A NAME="290"></A>to question him concerning the war, and the Deevs of Mazinderan. Then Saum 
<A NAME="291"></A>told him all the story of his battles. And Minuchihr listened with joy 
<A NAME="292"></A>though the tale was long, and when Saum had ended he praised his prowess. 
<A NAME="293"></A>And he lifted his crown unto heaven and rejoiced that his enemies were 
<A NAME="294"></A>thus confounded. Then be bade a banquet be spread, and all night long the 
<A NAME="295"></A>heroes feasted and shortened the hours with wine. But when the first rays 
<A NAME="296"></A>of morn had shed their light, the curtains of the Shah's house were opened, 
<A NAME="297"></A>that he might hold audience and grant the petitions of his people. And 
<A NAME="298"></A>Saum the Pehliva came the first to stand before the King, for he desired 
<A NAME="299"></A>to speak to him of Zal. But the Shah of the world would not suffer him 
<A NAME="300"></A>to open his lips, but said unto him-
<A NAME="301"></A><BR><BR>"Go hence, O Saum, and take with thee thine army, for I command 
<A NAME="302"></A>thee to go yet again to battle. Set forth unto Cabul and burn the house 
<A NAME="303"></A>of Mihrab the King, and utterly destroy his race and all who serve him, 
<A NAME="304"></A>nor suffer that any of the seed of Zohak escape destruction, for I will 
<A NAME="305"></A>that the earth be delivered of this serpent brood."
<A NAME="306"></A><BR><BR>When Saum heard these words he knew that the Shah was angered, 
<A NAME="307"></A>and that speech would avail him naught. So he kissed the throne and touched 
<A NAME="308"></A>the earth with his forehead, and said, "Lord, I am thy servant, and I obey 
<A NAME="309"></A>thy desires." And he departed, and the earth trembled under the stamping 
<A NAME="310"></A>of footmen and of hoofs, and the air of the city was darkened with his 
<A NAME="311"></A>spears.
<A NAME="312"></A><BR><BR>Now the news of Saum's intent reached even unto Cabul, and the 
<A NAME="313"></A>land was sunk in woe, and weeping filled the house of the King. But Zal 
<A NAME="314"></A>was wroth, and he went forth to meet his father. And when he was come to 
<A NAME="315"></A>the spot where he had encamped his army, he craved an audience. And Saum 
<A NAME="316"></A>granted it, and Zal reminded him yet again of his oath, and desired that 
<A NAME="317"></A>he would spare the land of Cabul, nor visit his judgments upon the innocent. 
<A NAME="318"></A>When Saum had listened, his heart was moved, and he 
<A NAME="319"></A>said-
<A NAME="320"></A><BR><BR>"O my son, thou speakest that which is right. To thee have I been 
<A NAME="321"></A>unjust from the day of thy birth. But stay thy wrath, for surely I will 
<A NAME="322"></A>find a remedy, and thy wishes shall yet be accomplished. For thou shalt 
<A NAME="323"></A>bear a letter unto the Shah, and when he shall have looked on thy face, 
<A NAME="324"></A>he will be moved with compassion and cease to trouble 
<A NAME="325"></A>thee."
<A NAME="326"></A><BR><BR>Then Zal kissed the ground before his father and craved the blessings 
<A NAME="327"></A>of God upon his head. And Saum dictated a letter to the Shah, and he spoke 
<A NAME="328"></A>therein of all he had done for Minuchihr, and how he had killed the dragon 
<A NAME="329"></A>that had laid waste the land, how he had ever subdued the foes of Iran, 
<A NAME="330"></A>and how the frontiers were enlarged by his hands. Yet now was he waxing 
<A NAME="331"></A>old, and could no longer do doughty deeds. But a brave son was his, worthy 
<A NAME="332"></A>and true, who would follow in his footsteps. Only his heart was devoured 
<A NAME="333"></A>of love, and perchance he would die if his longing were unsatisfied. And 
<A NAME="334"></A>therewith he commended to the wisdom of the Shah the affairs of 
<A NAME="335"></A>Zal.
<A NAME="336"></A><BR><BR>When the letter was ended Zal set forth with it unto the court, 
<A NAME="337"></A>and the flower of his army went with him.
<A NAME="338"></A><BR><BR>But the fear of Minuchihr was great in Cabul, and Mihrab pondered 
<A NAME="339"></A>how he should quench the wrath of the King of kings. And he spake to Sindokht 
<A NAME="340"></A>and said-
<A NAME="341"></A><BR><BR>"For that the King is angered against me because of thee and thy 
<A NAME="342"></A>daughter, and because I cannot stand before him, I will lead Rudabeh unto 
<A NAME="343"></A>his court and kill her before his eyes. Perchance his anger may be thus 
<A NAME="344"></A>allayed."
<A NAME="345"></A><BR><BR>Sindokht listened to his words in silence, and when he had ended 
<A NAME="346"></A>she cast about her for a plan, for she was quick of wit. And when she had 
<A NAME="347"></A>found one she came again into the presence of Mihrab, and she craved of 
<A NAME="348"></A>him that he should give her the key of his treasury. For she 
<A NAME="349"></A>said-
<A NAME="350"></A><BR><BR>"This is not the hour to be strait-handed; suffer that I take what 
<A NAME="351"></A>seemeth good unto me and go before Saum, it may be that I move him to spare 
<A NAME="352"></A>the land."
<A NAME="353"></A><BR><BR>And Mihrab agreed to her demand because of the fear that devoured 
<A NAME="354"></A>him. Then Sindokht went out to the house of Saum, and she took with her 
<A NAME="355"></A>three hundred thousand pieces of gold, and sixty horses caparisoned in 
<A NAME="356"></A>silver, bearing sixty slaves that held cups filled to the brim with musk 
<A NAME="357"></A>and camphor, and rubies, and turquoise, and precious stones of every kind. 
<A NAME="358"></A>And there followed two hundred dromedaries and four tall Indian elephants 
<A NAME="359"></A>laden with carpets and brocades of Roum, and the train reached for two 
<A NAME="360"></A>miles beyond the King's gates. Now when Sindokht was come to Seistan she 
<A NAME="361"></A>bade the guardians of the door say unto Saum that an envoy was come from 
<A NAME="362"></A>Cabul bearing a message. And Saum granted an audience, and Sindokht was 
<A NAME="363"></A>brought into his presence. Then she kissed the ground at his feet and called 
<A NAME="364"></A>upon Heaven to shower down blessings on his head. And when she had done 
<A NAME="365"></A>so, she caused her gifts to be laid before Saum, and when Saum beheld these 
<A NAME="366"></A>treasures, he marvelled and thought within himself, "How cometh it that 
<A NAME="367"></A>a woman is sent as envoy from a land that boasteth such riches? If I accept 
<A NAME="368"></A>them the Shah will be angered, and if I refuse perchance Zal will reproach 
<A NAME="369"></A>me that I rob him of his heritage." So he lifted his head and 
<A NAME="370"></A>said-
<A NAME="371"></A><BR><BR>"Let these treasures be given unto the treasurer of my 
<A NAME="372"></A>son."
<A NAME="373"></A><BR>When Sindokht beheld that her gifts were accepted, she rejoiced and 
<A NAME="374"></A>raised her voice in speech. And she questioned Saum, 
<A NAME="375"></A>saying-
<A NAME="376"></A><BR><BR>"Tell me, I pray thee, what wrong have the people of Cabul done 
<A NAME="377"></A>unto thee that thou wouldst destroy them?"
<A NAME="378"></A><BR><BR>Then answered Saum the hero, "Reply unto my questions and lie not. 
<A NAME="379"></A>Art thou the slave or the wife of Mihrab, and is it thy daughter whom Zal 
<A NAME="380"></A>hath seen? If indeed it be so, tell me, I pray, of her beauty, that I may 
<A NAME="381"></A>know if she be worthy of my son."
<A NAME="382"></A><BR><BR>Then Sindokht said, "O Pehliva, swear to me first a great oath 
<A NAME="383"></A>that thou wilt spare my life and the lives of those dear unto me. And when 
<A NAME="384"></A>I am assured of thy protection I will recount all that thou 
<A NAME="385"></A>desirest."
<A NAME="386"></A><BR><BR>Then Saum took the hand of Sindokht, and he sware unto her a great 
<A NAME="387"></A>oath, and gave her his word and his promise. And when she had heard it 
<A NAME="388"></A>she was no longer afraid, and she told him all her secrets. And she 
<A NAME="389"></A>said-
<A NAME="390"></A><BR><BR>"I am of the race of Zohak, and wife unto the valiant Mihrab, and 
<A NAME="391"></A>mother of Rudabeh, who hath found favour in the eyes of thy son. And I 
<A NAME="392"></A>am come to learn of thy desire, and who are thine enemies in Cabul. Destroy 
<A NAME="393"></A>the wicked, and those who merit chastisement, but spare, I pray thee, the 
<A NAME="394"></A>innocent, or thy deeds will change day into night."
<A NAME="395"></A><BR><BR>Then spake Saum, "My oath is sacred, and if it cost my life, thou 
<A NAME="396"></A>and thine and Cabul may rest assured that I will not harm them. And I desire 
<A NAME="397"></A>that Zal should find a wife in Rudabeh, though she be of an alien 
<A NAME="398"></A>race."
<A NAME="399"></A><BR><BR>And he told her how that he had written to the Shah a letter of 
<A NAME="400"></A>supplication such as only one in grief could pen, and how Zal was absent 
<A NAME="401"></A>with the message, and he craved her to tell him of Rudabeh.
<A NAME="402"></A><BR><BR>But Sindokht replied, "If the Pehliva of the world will make the 
<A NAME="403"></A>hearts of his slaves rejoice, he will visit us and look with his own eyes 
<A NAME="404"></A>upon our moon."
<A NAME="405"></A><BR><BR>And Saum smiled and said, "Rest content and deliver thine heart 
<A NAME="406"></A>of cares, for all shall end according unto thy desires."
<A NAME="407"></A><BR><BR>When Sindokht heard this she bade him farewell and made all haste 
<A NAME="408"></A>to return. And Saum loaded her with gifts and bade her depart in peace. 
<A NAME="409"></A>And Sindokht's face shone brightly, like unto the moon when she hath been 
<A NAME="410"></A>eclipsed, and hope once more reigned in her breast.
<A NAME="411"></A><BR><BR>Now listen to what happened to Zal while these things were passing 
<A NAME="412"></A>in Seistan. When he was come to the court of Minuchihr he hastened into 
<A NAME="413"></A>his presence, and kissed the ground at his feet, and lay prostrate before 
<A NAME="414"></A>him in the dust. And when the Shah saw this he was moved, and bade his 
<A NAME="415"></A>servants raise Zal, and pour musk before him. Then Zal drew nigh unto the 
<A NAME="416"></A>throne and gave to the King the letter written by Saum the son of Neriman. 
<A NAME="417"></A>And when Minuchihr had read it he was grieved, and said-
<A NAME="418"></A><BR><BR>"This letter, written by Saum thy father in his sorrow, hath awakened 
<A NAME="419"></A>an old pain within me. But for the sake of my faithful servant I will do 
<A NAME="420"></A>unto thee that which is thy desire. Yet I ask that thou abide with me a 
<A NAME="421"></A>little while that I may seek counsel about thee."
<A NAME="422"></A><BR><BR>Then the cooks brought forth a table of gold, and Zal was seated 
<A NAME="423"></A>beside the Shah and all the nobles according to their rank, and they ate 
<A NAME="424"></A>flesh and drank wine together. Then when the mantle of night was fallen 
<A NAME="425"></A>over the earth Zal sprang upon his steed and scoured the land in the unrest 
<A NAME="426"></A>of his spirit, for his heart was full of thoughts and his mouth of words. 
<A NAME="427"></A>But when morning was come he presented himself before the Shah in audience. 
<A NAME="428"></A>And his speech and mien found favour in the eyes of the Shah, and he called 
<A NAME="429"></A>unto him his Wise Men and bade them question the stars of this matter. 
<A NAME="430"></A>Three days and three nights did the Mubids search the heavens without ceasing, 
<A NAME="431"></A>and on the fourth they came before the Shah and spake. And they said unto 
<A NAME="432"></A>him-
<A NAME="433"></A><BR><BR>"Hail to thee, hero of the golden girdle, for we bring unto thee 
<A NAME="434"></A>glad tidings. The son of Saum and the daughter of Mihrab shall be a glorious 
<A NAME="435"></A>pair, and from their union shall spring a son like to a war-elephant, and 
<A NAME="436"></A>he shall subdue all men by his sword and raise the glory of Iran even unto 
<A NAME="437"></A>the skies. And he shall uproot the wicked from the earth so that there 
<A NAME="438"></A>shall be no room for them. Segsars and Mazinderan shall feel the weight 
<A NAME="439"></A>of his mace, and he shall bring much woe upon Turan, but Iran shall be 
<A NAME="440"></A>loaded with prosperity at his hands. And he will give back sleep to the 
<A NAME="441"></A>unhappy, and close the doors of discord, and bar the paths of wrong-doing. 
<A NAME="442"></A>The kingdom will rejoice while he lives; Roum, Ind, and Iran will grave 
<A NAME="443"></A>his name upon their seals."
<A NAME="444"></A><BR><BR>When the Shah had heard this he charged the Mubids that they keep 
<A NAME="445"></A>secret that which they had revealed unto him. And he called for Zal that 
<A NAME="446"></A>he might question him and test his wisdom. And the Wise Men and the Mubids 
<A NAME="447"></A>were seated in a circle, and they put these questions to the son of 
<A NAME="448"></A>Saum.
<A NAME="449"></A><BR><BR>And the first opened his mouth and said-
<A NAME="450"></A><BR><BR><B>"Twelve trees, well grown and green,</B> <B>Fair and lofty, 
<A NAME="451"></A>have I seen;</B> <B>Each has sprung with vigorous sprout,</B> <B>Sending 
<A NAME="452"></A>thirty branches out;</B> <B>Wax no more, nor wane, they can</B> <B>In the 
<A NAME="453"></A>kingdom of Iran."</B>
<A NAME="454"></A><BR><BR>And Zal pondered a while and then answered and 
<A NAME="455"></A>said-
<A NAME="456"></A><BR><BR><B>'Twelve moons in the year, and each I praise</B> <B>As a new-made 
<A NAME="457"></A>king on a new throne's blaze:</B> <B>Each comes to an end in thirty 
<A NAME="458"></A>days."</B>
<A NAME="459"></A><BR><BR>Then the second Mubid questioned him and said-
<A NAME="460"></A><BR><BR><B>"Thou whose head is high in air,</B> <B>Rede me now of coursers 
<A NAME="461"></A>twain;</B> <B>Both are noble, swift to speed;</B> <B>Black as storms in 
<A NAME="462"></A>the night one steed,</B> <B>The other crystal, white and fair,</B> <B>They 
<A NAME="463"></A>race for ever and haste in vain,</B> <B>Towards a goal they never 
<A NAME="464"></A>gain."</B>
<A NAME="465"></A><BR><BR>And Zal thought again yet a while and answered-
<A NAME="466"></A><BR><BR><B>"Two shining horses, one black, one white.</B> <B>That run for 
<A NAME="467"></A>ever in rapid flight;</B> <B>The one is the day, the other the night,</B> 
<A NAME="468"></A><B>That count the throbs of the heavens height,</B> <B>Like the hunted 
<A NAME="469"></A>prey from the following chase</B> <B>They flee, yet neither wins the 
<A NAME="470"></A>race."</B>
<A NAME="471"></A><BR><BR>Then the third Mubid questioned him and said-
<A NAME="472"></A><BR><BR><B>"Thirty knights before the king</B> <B>Pass along. Regard the 
<A NAME="473"></A>thing</B> <B>Closely; one is gone. Again</B> <B>Look- the thirty are in 
<A NAME="474"></A>train."</B>
<A NAME="475"></A><BR><BR>And Zal answered and spake-
<A NAME="476"></A><BR><BR><B>"Thirty knights of whom the train</B> <B>Is full, then fails, 
<A NAME="477"></A>then fills again,</B> <B>Know, each moon is reckoned thus,</B> <B>So willed 
<A NAME="478"></A>by God who governs us,</B> <B>And thy word is true of the faint moon's 
<A NAME="479"></A>wane,</B> <B>Now failing in darkness, now shining plain."</B>
<A NAME="480"></A><BR><BR>Then the fourth Mubid questioned him and said-
<A NAME="481"></A><BR><BR><B>"See a green garden full of springs;</B> <B>A strong man with 
<A NAME="482"></A>a sickle keen</B> <B>Enters, and reaps both dry and green;</B> <B>No word 
<A NAME="483"></A>thine utmost anguish wrings."</B>
<A NAME="484"></A><BR><BR>And Zal bethought him and replied-
<A NAME="485"></A><BR><BR><B>"Thy word was of a garden green,</B> <B>A reaper with a sickle 
<A NAME="486"></A>keen,</B> <B>Who cuts alike the fresh and the dry</B> <B>Nor heedeth prayer 
<A NAME="487"></A>nor any cry:</B> <B>Time is the reaper, we the grass;</B> <B>Pity nor fear 
<A NAME="488"></A>his spirit has,</B> <B>But old and young he reaps alike.</B> <B>No rank 
<A NAME="489"></A>can stay his sickle's strike,</B> <B>No love, but he will leave it lorn,</B> 
<A NAME="490"></A><B>For to this end all men are born.</B> <B>Birth opes to all the gate 
<A NAME="491"></A>of Life,</B> <B>Death shuts it down on love and strife,</B> <B>And Fate, 
<A NAME="492"></A>that counts the breath of man,</B> <B>Measures to each a reckoned 
<A NAME="493"></A>span."</B>
<A NAME="494"></A><BR><BR>Then the fifth Mubid questioned him and said-
<A NAME="495"></A><BR><BR><B>"Look how two lofty cypresses</B> <B>Spring up, like reeds, 
<A NAME="496"></A>from stormy seas,</B> <B>There builds a bird his dwelling-place;</B> <B>Upon 
<A NAME="497"></A>the one all night he stays,</B> <B>But swift, with the dawn, across he 
<A NAME="498"></A>flies;</B> <B>The abandoned tree dries up and dies,</B> <B>While that whereon 
<A NAME="499"></A>he sets his feet</B> <B>Breathes odours out, surpassing sweet.</B> <B>The 
<A NAME="500"></A>one is dead for ever and aye,</B> <B>The other lives and blooms 
<A NAME="501"></A>alway."</B>
<A NAME="502"></A><BR><BR>Then Zal yet again bethought him before he said-
<A NAME="503"></A><BR><BR><B>"Hear of the sea-born cypresses,</B> <B>Where builds a bird, 
<A NAME="504"></A>and rests, and flees.</B> <B>From the Ram to the Scales the earth o'erpowers,</B> 
<A NAME="505"></A><B>Shadows obscure of the night that lowers,</B> <B>But when the Scales' 
<A NAME="506"></A>sign it must quit,</B> <B>Darkness and gloom o'ermaster it;</B> <B>The 
<A NAME="507"></A>sides of heaven thy fable shows</B> <B>Whence grief to man or blessing 
<A NAME="508"></A>flows,</B> <B>The sun like a bird flies to and fro,</B> <B>Weal with him 
<A NAME="509"></A>bringing, but leaving woe."</B>
<A NAME="510"></A><BR><BR>Then the sixth Mubid questioned him, and it was the last question 
<A NAME="511"></A>that he asked, and he deemed it the hardest of all to answer. And all men 
<A NAME="512"></A>hung upon his words and listened to the answer of Zal. And the Mubid 
<A NAME="513"></A>said-
<A NAME="514"></A><BR><BR><B>"Builded on a rock I found</B> <B>A town. Men left the gate 
<A NAME="515"></A>and chose</B> <B>A thicket on the level ground.</B> <B>Soon their soaring 
<A NAME="516"></A>mansions rose</B> <B>Lifting roofs that reach the moon,</B> <B>Some men 
<A NAME="517"></A>slaves, some kings, became,</B> <B>Of their earlier city soon</B> <B>The 
<A NAME="518"></A>memory died in all. Its name</B> <B>None breathed. But hark! an earthquake; 
<A NAME="519"></A>down,</B> <B>Lost in the chasm lies the land-</B> <B>Now long they for

<A NAME="522"></A><B>If rightly thou the riddle rede,</B> <B>Black earth to musk thou hast 
<A NAME="523"></A>changed indeed."</B>
<A NAME="524"></A><BR><BR>And Zal pondered this riddle but a little while, and then opened 
<A NAME="525"></A>his mouth and said-
<A NAME="526"></A><BR><BR><B>"The eternal, final world is shown</B> <B>By image of a rock-built 
<A NAME="527"></A>town;</B> <B>The thicket is our passing life,</B> <B>A place of pleasure 
<A NAME="528"></A>and of pain,</B> <B>A world of dreams and eager strife,</B> <B>A time for 
<A NAME="529"></A>labour, and loss, and gain;</B> <B>This counts thy heart-beats, at its 
<A NAME="530"></A>will</B> <B>Prolongs their pulse or makes it still.</B> <B>But winds and 
<A NAME="531"></A>earthquake rouse: a cry</B> <B>Goes up of bitterness and woe,</B> <B>Now 
<A NAME="532"></A>we must leave our homes below</B> <B>And climb the rocky fastness high.</B> 
<A NAME="533"></A><B>Another reaps our fruit of pain,</B> <B>That yet to another leaves his 
<A NAME="534"></A>gain;</B> <B>So was it aye, must so remain.</B> <B>Well for us if our name 
<A NAME="535"></A>endure,</B> <B>Though we shall pass, beloved and pure,</B> <B>For all the 
<A NAME="536"></A>evil man hath done,</B> <B>Stalks, when he dies, in the sight of the sun;</B> 
<A NAME="537"></A><B>When dust is strown on breast and head,</B> <B>Then desolation reigns 
<A NAME="538"></A>with dread."</B>
<A NAME="539"></A><BR><BR>When Zal had spoken thus the Shah was glad, and an the assembly 
<A NAME="540"></A>were amazed, and lauded the son of Saum. And the King bade a great banquet 
<A NAME="541"></A>be prepared, and they drank wine until the world was darkened, and the 
<A NAME="542"></A>heads of the drinkers were troubled. Then when morn was come Zal prayed 
<A NAME="543"></A>that the Shah would dismiss him. But Minuchihr said-
<A NAME="544"></A><BR><BR>"Not so, abide with me yet another day," and he bade the drums 
<A NAME="545"></A>be beaten to call together his heroes, for he desired to test Zal also 
<A NAME="546"></A>in feats of strength. And the Shah sat upon the roof of his house and looked 
<A NAME="547"></A>down upon the games, and he beheld Zal, the son of Saum, do mighty deeds 
<A NAME="548"></A>of prowess. With his arrow did he shoot farther and straighter than the 
<A NAME="549"></A>rest, and with his spear he pierced all shields, and in wrestling he overcame 
<A NAME="550"></A>the strongest who had never known defeat. When the nobles beheld these 
<A NAME="551"></A>doughty deeds they shouted and clapped their hands, and Minuchihr loaded 
<A NAME="552"></A>Zal with gifts. Then he prepared a reply unto the letter of Saum. And he 
<A NAME="553"></A>wrote-
<A NAME="554"></A><BR><BR>"O my Pehliva, hero of great renown, I have listened to thy desires, 
<A NAME="555"></A>and I have beheld the youth who is worthy to be thy son. And he hath found 
<A NAME="556"></A>favour in my sight, and I send him back to thee satisfied. May his enemies 
<A NAME="557"></A>be impotent to harm him."
<A NAME="558"></A><BR><BR>Then when the Shah had given him leave to go, Zal set forth, and 
<A NAME="559"></A>he bare his head high in the joy of his heart. And when he came before 
<A NAME="560"></A>his father and gave to him the letter of the Shah, Saum was young again 
<A NAME="561"></A>for happiness. Then the drums sounded the signal to depart, and the tents 
<A NAME="562"></A>were prepared, and a messenger, mounted on a fleet dromedary, was sent 
<A NAME="563"></A>unto Mihrab to tell him that Saum and Zal were setting forth for Cabul. 
<A NAME="564"></A>And when Mihrab heard the tidings his fears were stilled, and he commanded 
<A NAME="565"></A>that his army be clad in festal array. And silken standards of bright colour 
<A NAME="566"></A>decked the city, and the sounds of trumpets, harps, and cymbals filled 
<A NAME="567"></A>the air. And Sindokht told the glad tidings to Rudabeh, and they made ready 
<A NAME="568"></A>the house like unto a paradise. Carpets broidered with gold and precious 
<A NAME="569"></A>stones did they lay down upon its floors, and set forth thrones of ivory 
<A NAME="570"></A>and rich carving. And the ground they watered with rose-water and 
<A NAME="571"></A>wine.
<A NAME="572"></A><BR><BR>Then when the guests were come near unto Cabul, Mihrab went forth 
<A NAME="573"></A>to meet them, and he placed upon the head of Zal a crown of diamonds, and 
<A NAME="574"></A>they came into the city in triumph. And all the people did homage before 
<A NAME="575"></A>them, and Sindokht met them at the doors of the King's house, and poured 
<A NAME="576"></A>out musk and precious stones before them. Then Saum, when he had replied 
<A NAME="577"></A>to their homage, smiled, and turned to Sindokht and 
<A NAME="578"></A>said-
<A NAME="579"></A><BR><BR>"How much longer dost thou think to hide Rudabeh from our 
<A NAME="580"></A>eyes?"
<A NAME="581"></A><BR>And Sindokht said, "What wilt thou give me to see the 
<A NAME="582"></A>sun?"
<A NAME="583"></A><BR>Then Saum replied, "All that thou wilt, even unto my slaves and my 
<A NAME="584"></A>throne, will I give to thee."
<A NAME="585"></A><BR><BR>Then Sindokht led him within the curtains, and when Saum beheld 
<A NAME="586"></A>Rudabeh he was struck dumb with wonder, for her beauty exceeded dreams, 
<A NAME="587"></A>and he knew not how he could find words to praise her. Then he asked of 
<A NAME="588"></A>Mihrab that he would give unto him her hand, and they concluded an alliance 
<A NAME="589"></A>according to custom and the law. And the lovers were seated upon a throne, 
<A NAME="590"></A>and Mihrab read out the list of the gifts, and it was so long the ear did 
<A NAME="591"></A>not suffice to hear them. Then they repaired unto the banquet, and they 
<A NAME="592"></A>feasted seven days without ceasing. And when a month had passed Saum went 
<A NAME="593"></A>back to Seistan, and Zal and Rudabeh followed after him. And speedily did 
<A NAME="594"></A>he set forth again to battle, and left the kingdom in the hands of his 
<A NAME="595"></A>son, and Zal administered it with wisdom and judgment. And Rudabeh sat 
<A NAME="596"></A>beside him on the throne, and he placed a crown of gold upon her 
<A NAME="597"></A>head.
