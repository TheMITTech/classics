<A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A>On a certain day it came about that Tus, Gew, Gudarz, and other brave knights 
<A NAME="11"></A>of Iran went forth to chase wild asses in the forests of Daghoui. Now when 
<A NAME="12"></A>they were come into the wood, they found therein a woman of surpassing 
<A NAME="13"></A>beauty, and the hearts of Tus and Gew burned towards her in love. And when 
<A NAME="14"></A>they had questioned her of her lineage, and learned that she was of the 
<A NAME="15"></A>race of Feridoun, each desired to take her to wife. But none would give 
<A NAME="16"></A>way unto the other, and hot words were bandied, and they were like to come 
<A NAME="17"></A>unto blows. Then one spake, and said-
<A NAME="18"></A><BR><BR>"I counsel you, let Kai Kaous decide between you." And they listened 
<A NAME="19"></A>to the voice of the counsellor, and they took with them the Peri-faced, 
<A NAME="20"></A>and led her before Kai Kaous, and recounted to him all that was come about. 
<A NAME="21"></A>But Kai Kaous, when he beheld the beauty of the maid, longed after her 
<A NAME="22"></A>for himself, and he said that she was worthy of the throne; and he took 
<A NAME="23"></A>her and led her into the house of his women.
<A NAME="24"></A><BR><BR>Now after many days there was born to her a son, and he was of 
<A NAME="25"></A>goodly mien, tall and strong, and the name that was given to him was Saiawush. 
<A NAME="26"></A>And Kai Kaous rejoiced in this son of his race, but he was grieved also 
<A NAME="27"></A>because of the message of the stars concerning him. For it was written 
<A NAME="28"></A>that the heavens were hostile unto this infant; neither would his virtues 
<A NAME="29"></A>avail him aught, for these above all would lead him into 
<A NAME="30"></A>destruction.
<A NAME="31"></A><BR><BR>In the meantime the news that a son had been born unto the Shah 
<A NAME="32"></A>spread even unto the land of Rustem. And the Pehliva, when he learned thereof, 
<A NAME="33"></A>aroused him from his sorrow for Sohrab, and he came forth out of Zaboulistan, 
<A NAME="34"></A>and asked for the babe at the hands of its father, that he might rear it 
<A NAME="35"></A>unto Iran. And Kai Kaous suffered it, and Rustem bare the child unto his 
<A NAME="36"></A>kingdom, and trained him in the arts of war and of the banquet. And Saiawush 
<A NAME="37"></A>increased in might and beauty, and you would have said that the world held 
<A NAME="38"></A>not his like.
<A NAME="39"></A><BR><BR>Now when Saiawush was become strong (so that he could ensnare a 
<A NAME="40"></A>lion), he came before Rustem, bearing high his head. And he spake, 
<A NAME="41"></A>saying-
<A NAME="42"></A><BR><BR>"I desire to go before the Shah, that my father may behold me, 
<A NAME="43"></A>and see what manner of man thou hast made of me."
<A NAME="44"></A><BR><BR>And Rustem deemed that he spake well. So he made great preparations, 
<A NAME="45"></A>and marched unto Iran with a mighty host, and Saiawush rode with him at 
<A NAME="46"></A>their head. And the land rejoiced when it looked on the face of Saiawush, 
<A NAME="47"></A>and there was great joy in the courts of the King, and jewels and gold 
<A NAME="48"></A>and precious things past the telling rained upon Rustem and Saiawush his 
<A NAME="49"></A>charge. And Kai Kaous was glad when he beheld the boy, and gave rich rewards 
<A NAME="50"></A>unto Rustem; but Saiawush did he place beside him on the throne. And all 
<A NAME="51"></A>men spake his praises, and there was a feast given, such as the world hath 
<A NAME="52"></A>not seen the like.
<A NAME="53"></A><BR><BR>Then Saiawush stayed in the courts of his father, and seven years 
<A NAME="54"></A>did he prove his spirit; but in the eighth, when he had found him worthy, 
<A NAME="55"></A>he gave unto him a throne and a crown. And all was well, and men had forgotten 
<A NAME="56"></A>the evil message of the stars. But that which is written in the heavens, 
<A NAME="57"></A>it is surely accomplished, and the day of ill fortune drew nigh. For it 
<A NAME="58"></A>came about that Sudaveh beheld the youth of Saiawush, and her eyes were 
<A NAME="59"></A>filled with his beauty, and her soul burned after him. So she sent unto 
<A NAME="60"></A>him a messenger, and invited him to enter the house of the women. But he 
<A NAME="61"></A>sent in answer words of excuse, for he trusted her not. Then Sudaveh made 
<A NAME="62"></A>complaint before Kai Kaous that Saiawush had deafened his ear unto her 
<A NAME="63"></A>request, and she bade the Shah send him behind the curtains of the women's 
<A NAME="64"></A>house, that his son might become acquainted with his sisters. And Kai Kaous 
<A NAME="65"></A>did that which Sudaveh asked of him, and Saiawush obeyed his 
<A NAME="66"></A>commands.
<A NAME="67"></A><BR><BR>But Sudaveh, when she had so far accomplished her longing that 
<A NAME="68"></A>she had gotten him within the house, desired that he should speak with 
<A NAME="69"></A>her alone. But Saiawush resisted her wish. And three times did Sudaveh 
<A NAME="70"></A>entice him behind the curtains of the house, and three times was Saiawush 
<A NAME="71"></A>cold unto her yearning. Then Sudaveh was wroth, and she made complaint 
<A NAME="72"></A>unto the Shah, and she slandered the fair fame of Saiawush, and she spread 
<A NAME="73"></A>evil reports of him throughout the land, and she inflamed the heart of 
<A NAME="74"></A>Kai Kaous against his son. Now the Shah was angered beyond measure, and 
<A NAME="75"></A>it availed nought unto Saiawush to defend himself, for Kai Kaous was filled 
<A NAME="76"></A>with the love of Sudaveh, and he listened only unto her voice. And he remembered 
<A NAME="77"></A>how she had borne his captivity in Hamaveran, and he knew not of her evil 
<A NAME="78"></A>deceits. And when she said that Saiawush had done her great wrong, Kai 
<A NAME="79"></A>Kaous was troubled in his spirit, and he resolved how he should act, for 
<A NAME="80"></A>his heart went out also unto his son, and he feared that guile lurked in 
<A NAME="81"></A>these things. And he could not decide between them. So he caused dromedaries 
<A NAME="82"></A>to be sent forth, even unto the borders of the land, and bring forth wood 
<A NAME="83"></A>from the forests. And they did so, and there was reared a mighty heap of 
<A NAME="84"></A>logs, so that the eye could behold it at a distance of two farsangs. And 
<A NAME="85"></A>it was piled so that a path ran through its midst such as a mounted knight 
<A NAME="86"></A>could traverse. And the Shah commanded that naphtha be poured upon the 
<A NAME="87"></A>wood; and when it was done he bade that it be lighted, and there were needed 
<A NAME="88"></A>two hundred men to light the pyre, so great was its width and height. And 
<A NAME="89"></A>the flames and smoke overspread the heavens, and men shouted for fear when 
<A NAME="90"></A>they beheld the tongues of fire, and the heat thereof was felt in the far 
<A NAME="91"></A>corners of the land.
<A NAME="92"></A><BR><BR>Now when all was ready, Kai Kaous bade Saiawush his son ride into 
<A NAME="93"></A>the midst of the burning mount, that he might prove his innocence. And 
<A NAME="94"></A>Saiawush did as the King commanded, and he came before Kai Kaous, and saluted 
<A NAME="95"></A>him, and made him ready for the ordeal. And when he came nigh unto the 
<A NAME="96"></A>burning wood, he commended his soul unto God, and prayed that He would 
<A NAME="97"></A>make him pure before his father. And when he had done so, he gave rein 
<A NAME="98"></A>unto his horse, and entered into the flame. And a great cry of sorrow arose 
<A NAME="99"></A>from all men in the plains and in the city, for they held that no man could 
<A NAME="100"></A>come forth alive from this furnace. And Sudaveh heard the cry, and came 
<A NAME="101"></A>forth upon the roof of her house that she might behold the sight, and she 
<A NAME="102"></A>prayed that ill might befall unto Saiawush, and she held her eyes fastened 
<A NAME="103"></A>upon the pyre. But the nobles gazed on the face of Kai Kaous, and their 
<A NAME="104"></A>mouths were filled with execrations, and their lips trembled with wrath 
<A NAME="105"></A>at this deed.
<A NAME="106"></A><BR><BR>And Saiawush rode on undaunted, and his white robes and ebon steed 
<A NAME="107"></A>shone forth between the flames, and their anger was reflected upon his 
<A NAME="108"></A>helmet of gold. And he rode until he was come unto the end of the pathway, 
<A NAME="109"></A>and when he came forth there was not singed a hair of his head, neither 
<A NAME="110"></A>had the smoke blackened his garments.
<A NAME="111"></A><BR><BR>Now when the people beheld that he was come forth alive, they rent 
<A NAME="112"></A>the welkin with their shouting. And the nobles came forth to greet him, 
<A NAME="113"></A>and, save only Sudaveh, there was joy in all hearts. Now Saiawush rode 
<A NAME="114"></A>till he came before the Shah, and then he got him off his horse, and did 
<A NAME="115"></A>homage before his father. And when Kai Kaous beheld him, and saw that there 
<A NAME="116"></A>were no signs of fire about him, he knew that he was innocent. So he raised 
<A NAME="117"></A>his son from off the ground, and placed Saiawush beside him on the throne, 
<A NAME="118"></A>and asked his forgiveness for that which was come to pass. And Saiawush 
<A NAME="119"></A>granted it. Then Kai Kaous feasted his son with wine and song, and three 
<A NAME="120"></A>days did they spend in revels, and the door of the King's treasury was 
<A NAME="121"></A>opened.
<A NAME="122"></A><BR><BR>But on the fourth day Kai Kaous mounted the throne of the Kaianides. 
<A NAME="123"></A>He took in his hand the ox-headed mace, and he commanded that Sudaveh be 
<A NAME="124"></A>led before him. Then he reproached her with her evil deeds, and he bade 
<A NAME="125"></A>her make ready to depart the world, for verily death was decreed unto her. 
<A NAME="126"></A>And in vain did Sudaveh ask for pardon at the hands of the King, for she 
<A NAME="127"></A>continued to speak ill of Saiawush, and she said that by the arts of magic 
<A NAME="128"></A>alone had he escaped the fire, and she ceased not to cry against him. So 
<A NAME="129"></A>the King gave orders that she be led forth unto death, and the nobles approved 
<A NAME="130"></A>his resolve, and invoked the blessings of Heaven upon the head of the Shah. 
<A NAME="131"></A>But Saiawush, when he learned it, was grieved, for he knew that the woman 
<A NAME="132"></A>was beloved of his father. And he went before Kai Kaous, and craved her 
<A NAME="133"></A>pardon. And Kai Kaous granted it with gladness, for his heart yearned after 
<A NAME="134"></A>Sudaveh. So Saiawush led her back, and the curtains of the house of the 
<A NAME="135"></A>women hid her once more behind them, and the Shah was glad again in her 
<A NAME="136"></A>sight.
<A NAME="137"></A><BR><BR>Then it came about that the love of Kai Kaous for Sudaveh grew 
<A NAME="138"></A>yet mightier, and he was as wax under her hands. And when she saw that 
<A NAME="139"></A>her empire over him was strengthened, she filled his ear with plaints of 
<A NAME="140"></A>Saiawush, and she darkened the mind of the Shah till that his spirit was 
<A NAME="141"></A>troubled, and he knew not where he should turn for truth.
<A NAME="142"></A><BR><BR>Now while Kai Kaous thus dallied behind the curtains of his house, 
<A NAME="143"></A>Afrasiyab made him ready with three thousand chosen men to fall upon the 
<A NAME="144"></A>land of Iran. And Kai Kaous, when he learned it, was sad, for he knew that 
<A NAME="145"></A>he must exchange the banquet for the battle; and he was angered also with 
<A NAME="146"></A>Afrasiyab, and he poured out words of reproof against him because he had 
<A NAME="147"></A>broken his covenant and had once more attacked his land. Yet he made him 
<A NAME="148"></A>ready to lead forth his army. Then a Mubid prayed him that he would not 
<A NAME="149"></A>go forth himself, and he recalled unto Kai Kaous how twice already he had 
<A NAME="150"></A>endangered his kingdom. But Kai Kaous was wroth when he heard these words, 
<A NAME="151"></A>and he bade the Mubid depart from his presence, and he sware that he alone 
<A NAME="152"></A>could turn the army unto good issue.
<A NAME="153"></A><BR><BR>But Saiawush, when he heard it, took heart of grace, for he thought 
<A NAME="154"></A>within his spirit, "If the King grant unto me to lead forth his army, perchance 
<A NAME="155"></A>I may win unto myself a name of valour, and be delivered from the wiles 
<A NAME="156"></A>of Sudaveh." So he girded himself with the armour of battle and came before 
<A NAME="157"></A>the King his father, and made known to him his request. And he recalled 
<A NAME="158"></A>unto Kai Kaous how that he was his son, and how he was sprung from a worthy 
<A NAME="159"></A>race, and how his rank permitted him to lead forth a host; and Kai Kaous 
<A NAME="160"></A>listened to his words with gladness, and assented to his desires. Then 
<A NAME="161"></A>messengers were sent unto Rustem to bid him go forth to battle with his 
<A NAME="162"></A>charge and guard him. And Kai Kaous said unto his Pehliva-
<A NAME="163"></A><BR><BR>"If thou watchest over him, I can slumber; but if thou reposest, 
<A NAME="164"></A>then doth it beseem me to act."
<A NAME="165"></A><BR><BR>And Rustem answered and said, "O King, I am thy servant, and it 
<A NAME="166"></A>behoveth me to do thy will. As for Saiawush, he is the light of my heart 
<A NAME="167"></A>and the joy of my soul; I rejoice to lead him forth before his 
<A NAME="168"></A>enemies."
<A NAME="169"></A><BR><BR>So the trumpets of war were sounded, and the clang of armour and 
<A NAME="170"></A>the tramp of horsemen and of foot filled the air. And five Mubids bare 
<A NAME="171"></A>aloft the standard of Kawah, and the army followed after them. And they 
<A NAME="172"></A>passed in order before Kai Kaous, and he blessed the troops and his son, 
<A NAME="173"></A>who rode at their head. And he spake, saying-
<A NAME="174"></A><BR><BR>"May thy good star shine down upon thee, and mayst thou come back 
<A NAME="175"></A>to me victorious and glad."
<A NAME="176"></A><BR><BR>Then Kai Kaous returned him unto his house, and Saiawush gave the 
<A NAME="177"></A>signal to depart. And they marched until they came unto the land of 
<A NAME="178"></A>Zaboulistan.
<A NAME="179"></A><BR><BR>Now when they were come there they rested them a while, and feasted 
<A NAME="180"></A>in the house of Zal. And while they revelled there came out to join them 
<A NAME="181"></A>riders from Cabul and from Ind, and wherever there was a king of might 
<A NAME="182"></A>he sent over his army to aid them. Then when a month had rolled above their 
<A NAME="183"></A>heads they took their leave of Zal and of Zaboulistan, and went forward 
<A NAME="184"></A>till they came unto Balkh. And at Balkh the men of Turan met them, and 
<A NAME="185"></A>Gersiwaz, the brother of Afrasiyab, was at their head. Now when he saw 
<A NAME="186"></A>the hosts of Iran, he knew that the hour to fight was come. So the two 
<A NAME="187"></A>armies made them in order, and they waged battle hot and sore, and for 
<A NAME="188"></A>three days the fighting raged without ceasing, but on the fourth victory 
<A NAME="189"></A>passed over to Iran. Then Saiawush called before him a scribe, and wrote 
<A NAME="190"></A>a letter, perfumed with musk, unto Kai Kaous his father. And when he had 
<A NAME="191"></A>invoked the blessings of Heaven upon his head, he told him all that was 
<A NAME="192"></A>come to pass, and how he had conquered the foes of Iran. And Kai Kaous, 
<A NAME="193"></A>when he had read the letter, rejoiced, and wrote an answer unto his son, 
<A NAME="194"></A>and his gladness shone in his words, and you would have said it was a letter 
<A NAME="195"></A>like to the tender green of spring.
<A NAME="196"></A><BR><BR>But Afrasiyab, when he learned the news, was discomfited, and that 
<A NAME="197"></A>which Gersiwaz told unto him was bitter to his taste, and he was beside 
<A NAME="198"></A>himself for anger. Now when he had heard his brother to an end, Afrasiyab 
<A NAME="199"></A>laid him down to slumber. Yet ere the night was spent there came out one 
<A NAME="200"></A>to the house of Gersiwaz and told unto him that Afrasiyab was shouting 
<A NAME="201"></A>like to a man bereft of reason. Then Gersiwaz went in unto the King, and 
<A NAME="202"></A>he beheld him lying upon the floor of his chamber roaring in agony of spirit. 
<A NAME="203"></A>Then he raised him, and questioned him wherefore he cried out thus. But 
<A NAME="204"></A>Afrasiyab said-
<A NAME="205"></A><BR><BR>"Question me not until I have recovered my wits, for I am like 
<A NAME="206"></A>to one possessed."
<A NAME="207"></A><BR><BR>Then he desired that torches be brought within to light up the 
<A NAME="208"></A>darkness, and he gathered his robes about him and mounted upon his throne. 
<A NAME="209"></A>And when he had done so he called for the Mubids, and he recounted to them 
<A NAME="210"></A>the dream that had visited his slumber. And he told how that he had seen 
<A NAME="211"></A>the earth filled with serpents, and the Iranians were fallen upon him, 
<A NAME="212"></A>and evil was come to him from Kai Kaous and a boy that stood beside him 
<A NAME="213"></A>on the throne. And he trembled as he related his dream, and he would take 
<A NAME="214"></A>no comfort from the words of Gersiwaz.
<A NAME="215"></A><BR><BR>Now the Mubids as they listened were afraid, and when Afrasiyab 
<A NAME="216"></A>bade them open their lips, they dared not for fear. Then the King said 
<A NAME="217"></A>that he would cleave open their heads if they spake not, and he sware unto 
<A NAME="218"></A>them a great oath that he would spare them, even though the words they 
<A NAME="219"></A>should utter be evil. Then they revealed to him how it was written that 
<A NAME="220"></A>Saiawush would bring destruction upon Turan, and how he would be victorious 
<A NAME="221"></A>over the Turks, and how, even though he should fall by the hands of Afrasiyab, 
<A NAME="222"></A>this evil could not be stayed. And they counselled Afrasiyab to contend 
<A NAME="223"></A>no longer against the son of Kai Kaous, for surely if he stayed not his 
<A NAME="224"></A>hand this evil could not be turned aside.
<A NAME="225"></A><BR><BR>When Afrasiyab heard this message, he took counsel with Gersiwaz, 
<A NAME="226"></A>and he said-
<A NAME="227"></A><BR><BR>"If I cease from warring against Saiawush surely none of these 
<A NAME="228"></A>things can come about. It beseemeth me to seek after peace. I will send 
<A NAME="229"></A>therefore silver and jewels and rich gifts unto Saiawush, and will bind 
<A NAME="230"></A>up with gold the eye of war."
<A NAME="231"></A><BR><BR>So he bade Gersiwaz take from his treasures rich brocades of Roum, 
<A NAME="232"></A>and jewels of price, and bear them across the Jihun to the camp of Saiawush. 
<A NAME="233"></A>And he sent a message unto him, saying-
<A NAME="234"></A><BR><BR>"The world is disturbed since the days of Silim and Tur, the valiant, 
<A NAME="235"></A>since the times of Irij, who was killed unjustly. But now, let us forget 
<A NAME="236"></A>these things, let us conclude an alliance together, and let peace reign 
<A NAME="237"></A>in our borders."
<A NAME="238"></A><BR><BR>And Gersiwaz did as Afrasiyab bade, and he went forth, and a train 
<A NAME="239"></A>of camels bearing rich presents followed after him. And he marched till 
<A NAME="240"></A>he came within the tents of Saiawush.
<A NAME="241"></A><BR><BR>Now when he had delivered his message unto Saiawush, the young 
<A NAME="242"></A>King marvelled thereat; and he took counsel with Rustem how they should 
<A NAME="243"></A>act, for he trusted not in the words of Afrasiyab, and he deemed that poison 
<A NAME="244"></A>was hidden under these flowers. And Rustem counselled him that they should 
<A NAME="245"></A>entertain Gersiwaz the space of seven days, and that joy and feasting should 
<A NAME="246"></A>resound throughout the camp, and in the mean season they would ponder their 
<A NAME="247"></A>deeds. And it was done as Rustem said, and the sounds of revelry were abroad, 
<A NAME="248"></A>and Gersiwaz rejoiced in the presence of Saiawush. But on the eighth day 
<A NAME="249"></A>Gersiwaz presented himself before Saiawush in audience, and demanded a 
<A NAME="250"></A>reply. And Saiawush said-
<A NAME="251"></A><BR><BR>"We have pondered thy message, and we yield to thy request, for 
<A NAME="252"></A>we desire not bloodshed but peace. Yet since it behoveth us to know that 
<A NAME="253"></A>poison be not hidden under thy words, we desire of thee that thou send 
<A NAME="254"></A>over to us as hostages an hundred chosen men of Turan, allied unto Afrasiyab 
<A NAME="255"></A>by blood, that we may guard them as a pledge of thy 
<A NAME="256"></A>words."
<A NAME="257"></A><BR><BR>When Gersiwaz heard this answer, he sent it unto Afrasiyab by a 
<A NAME="258"></A>messenger quick as the wind. And Afrasiyab, when he heard it, was troubled, 
<A NAME="259"></A>for he said-
<A NAME="260"></A><BR><BR>"If I give way to this demand I bereave the land of its choicest 
<A NAME="261"></A>warriors; yet if I refuse, Saiawush will deny belief unto my words, and 
<A NAME="262"></A>the evils foretold will fall upon me."
<A NAME="263"></A><BR><BR>So he chose out from among his army men allied to him by blood, 
<A NAME="264"></A>and he sent them forth unto Saiawush. Then he caused the trumpets to sound, 
<A NAME="265"></A>and retreated with his army unto Turan, and restored unto Iran the lands 
<A NAME="266"></A>he had seized.
<A NAME="267"></A><BR><BR>Now when Rustem beheld the warriors, and that Afrasiyab had spoken 
<A NAME="268"></A>that which was true, he suffered Gersiwaz to depart; and he held counsel 
<A NAME="269"></A>with Saiawush how they should acquaint Kai Kaous with that which was come 
<A NAME="270"></A>to pass, for Saiawush said-
<A NAME="271"></A><BR><BR>"If Kai Kaous desire vengeance rather than peace, he will be angered 
<A NAME="272"></A>and commit a deed of folly. Who shall bear unto him these 
<A NAME="273"></A>tidings?"
<A NAME="274"></A><BR><BR>And Rustem said, "Suffer that I go forth to tell them unto Kai 
<A NAME="275"></A>Kaous, for verily he will listen unto that which I shall speak, and honour 
<A NAME="276"></A>will fall upon Saiawush for this adventure."
<A NAME="277"></A><BR><BR>Wherefore Rustem went before the King, and told him they had conquered 
<A NAME="278"></A>Afrasiyab, and how he was become afraid, and how there was concluded a 
<A NAME="279"></A>peace between them. And he vaunted the wisdom of Saiawush that was quick 
<A NAME="280"></A>to act and quick to refrain, and he craved the Shah to confirm what they 
<A NAME="281"></A>had done. But Kai Kaous was angered when he heard it, and he said that 
<A NAME="282"></A>Saiawush had done like to an infant. And he loaded reproaches upon Rustem, 
<A NAME="283"></A>and said that his counsels were vile, and he sware that he would be avenged 
<A NAME="284"></A>upon Turan. Then he recalled all they had suffered in the days that were 
<A NAME="285"></A>past at the hands of Afrasiyab, and he said the tree of vengeance could 
<A NAME="286"></A>not be uprooted. And he desired Rustem that he turn him back unto Balkh, 
<A NAME="287"></A>and say unto Saiawush that he should destroy these hostages of Turan, and 
<A NAME="288"></A>that he should fall again upon Afrasiyab, nor cease from fighting. But 
<A NAME="289"></A>Rustem, when he had heard him to an end, opened his mouth and said unto 
<A NAME="290"></A>the Shah-
<A NAME="291"></A><BR><BR>"O King, listen to my voice, and do not that which is evil! Verily 
<A NAME="292"></A>I say unto thee that Saiawush will not break his oath unto Afrasiyab, neither 
<A NAME="293"></A>will he destroy these men of Turan that were delivered into his 
<A NAME="294"></A>hands."
<A NAME="295"></A><BR><BR>When Kai Kaous heard his speech his anger was kindled, and he upbraided 
<A NAME="296"></A>Rustem, and said that his evil counsels had caused Saiawush to swerve from 
<A NAME="297"></A>the straight path; and he taunted him and bade him go back unto Seistan, 
<A NAME="298"></A>and he said that Tus should go forth as Pehliva unto his son. Then Rustem 
<A NAME="299"></A>too was angered, and he gave back the reproaches of the Shah, and he turned 
<A NAME="300"></A>him and quitted the courts and sped him back unto his kingdom. But Kai 
<A NAME="301"></A>Kaous sent Tus unto the army at his borders, and he bade him speak his 
<A NAME="302"></A>desires unto Saiawush his son.
<A NAME="303"></A><BR><BR>Now Saiawush, when he learned what was come about, was sore discomfited, 
<A NAME="304"></A>and he pondered how he should act. For he said, "How can I come before 
<A NAME="305"></A>Ormuzd if I depart from mine oath? Yet, however I shall act, I see around 
<A NAME="306"></A>me but perdition."
<A NAME="307"></A><BR><BR>Then he called for Bahram and Zengueh, and confided to them his 
<A NAME="308"></A>troubles. And he said how that Kai Kaous was a king who knew not good from 
<A NAME="309"></A>evil, and how he had accomplished that wherefore the army went forth, yet 
<A NAME="310"></A>how the Shah desired that vengeance should not cease. And he 
<A NAME="311"></A>said-
<A NAME="312"></A><BR><BR>"If I listen to the commands of the King, I do that which is evil; 
<A NAME="313"></A>yet if I listen not, surely he will destroy me. Wherefore I will send back 
<A NAME="314"></A>unto Afrasiyab the men he hath placed within my hands, and then hide me 
<A NAME="315"></A>from sight."
<A NAME="316"></A><BR><BR>Then he sent Zengueh before Afrasiyab with a writing. And he told 
<A NAME="317"></A>therein all that was come about, and how that discord was sprouted out 
<A NAME="318"></A>of their peace. And he recalled unto Afrasiyab how he had not broken their 
<A NAME="319"></A>treaty though Kai Kaous had bidden him do it, and he said how he could 
<A NAME="320"></A>not return unto the King his father. Then he prayed Afrasiyab that he would 
<A NAME="321"></A>make a passage for him through his dominions, that he might hide him wheresoever 
<A NAME="322"></A>God desired. For he said-
<A NAME="323"></A><BR><BR>"I seek a spot where my name shall be lost unto Kai Kaous, and 
<A NAME="324"></A>where I may not know of his woeful deeds."
<A NAME="325"></A><BR><BR>And Zengueh set forth and did as Saiawush desired, and he took 
<A NAME="326"></A>with him the hundred men of Turan, and all the gold and jewels that Afrasiyab 
<A NAME="327"></A>had sent. And when he was come within the gates Afrasiyab received him 
<A NAME="328"></A>right kindly, but when he had heard his message he was downcast in his 
<A NAME="329"></A>spirit. Then he called for Piran, the leader of his hosts, and he took 
<A NAME="330"></A>counsel with him how he should act. And Piran said-
<A NAME="331"></A><BR><BR>"O King, live for ever! There is but one road open unto thee. For 
<A NAME="332"></A>this Prince is noble, and he hath done that which is right, for he would 
<A NAME="333"></A>not give ear unto the evil designs of Kai Kaous, his father. Wherefore 
<A NAME="334"></A>I counsel thee, receive him within thy courts, and give unto him a daughter 
<A NAME="335"></A>in marriage, and let him be to thee a son; for verily, when Kai Kaous shall 
<A NAME="336"></A>die, he will mount upon the throne of Iran, and thus may the hate of old 
<A NAME="337"></A>be quenched in love."
<A NAME="338"></A><BR><BR>Now Afrasiyab, when he had listened to the words of Piran, knew 
<A NAME="339"></A>that they were good. So he sent for a scribe, and dictated a writing unto 
<A NAME="340"></A>Saiawush. And he said unto him how the land was open to receive him, and 
<A NAME="341"></A>how he would be to him a father, and how he should find in Turan the love 
<A NAME="342"></A>that was denied of Kai Kaous. And he said-
<A NAME="343"></A><BR><BR>"I will demand of thee nought but what is good, neither will I 
<A NAME="344"></A>suffer suspicion against thee to enter my soul."
<A NAME="345"></A><BR><BR>Then he sealed the letter with his royal seal, and gave it unto 
<A NAME="346"></A>Zengueh the messenger, and bade him depart there with speed. And Saiawush, 
<A NAME="347"></A>when he had read it, was glad, and yet he was also troubled in his spirit, 
<A NAME="348"></A>for his heart was sore because he was forced to make a friend of the foe 
<A NAME="349"></A>of his land. Yet he saw that it could in nowise be altered. So he wrote 
<A NAME="350"></A>a letter to Kai Kaous, and he told him therein how it seemed that he could 
<A NAME="351"></A>not do that which was right in his eyes, and he recalled unto him the troubles 
<A NAME="352"></A>that were come upon him from Sudaveh, and he said how he could not break 
<A NAME="353"></A>an oath he had made. Then he confided this writing unto Bahram, and he 
<A NAME="354"></A>bade him take the lead of the army till that Tus should be come forth from 
<A NAME="355"></A>Iran. And when he had chosen out an hundred warriors of renown from out 
<A NAME="356"></A>the host, he departed with them across the border.
<A NAME="357"></A><BR><BR>Now when Tus arrived and learned what was come to pass, he was 
<A NAME="358"></A>confounded; and when tidings thereof reached Kai Kaous, he was struck down 
<A NAME="359"></A>with dismay. He cried out against Afrasiyab, and against Saiawush his son, 
<A NAME="360"></A>and his anger was kindled. Yet he refrained from combat, and his mouth 
<A NAME="361"></A>was silent of war.
<A NAME="362"></A><BR><BR>In the meantime Saiawush was come into Turan, and all the land 
<A NAME="363"></A>had decked itself to do him honour. And Piran came forth to greet him, 
<A NAME="364"></A>and there followed after him elephants, white of hue, richly caparisoned, 
<A NAME="365"></A>laden with gifts. And these he poured before Saiawush, and gave him welcome. 
<A NAME="366"></A>And he told him how Afrasiyab yearned to look upon his face, and he 
<A NAME="367"></A>said-
<A NAME="368"></A><BR><BR>"Turn thee in amity unto the King, and let not thy mind be troubled 
<A NAME="369"></A>concerning that which thou hast heard about him. For Afrasiyab hath an 
<A NAME="370"></A>ill fame, but he deserveth it not, for he is good."
<A NAME="371"></A><BR><BR>Then Piran led Saiawush before Afrasiyab. And when Afrasiyab saw 
<A NAME="372"></A>him, he rejoiced at his strength and his beauty, and his heart went out 
<A NAME="373"></A>towards him, and he embraced him, and spake, saying-
<A NAME="374"></A><BR><BR>"The evil that hath disturbed the world is quieted, and the lamb 
<A NAME="375"></A>and the leopard can feed together, for now is there friendship between 
<A NAME="376"></A>our lands."
<A NAME="377"></A><BR><BR>Then he called down blessings upon the head of Saiawush, and he 
<A NAME="378"></A>took him by the hand and seated him beside him on the throne. And he turned 
<A NAME="379"></A>to Piran, and said-
<A NAME="380"></A><BR><BR>"Kai Kaous is a man void of sense, or surely he would not suffer 
<A NAME="381"></A>a son like unto this to depart from out his sight."
<A NAME="382"></A><BR><BR>And Afrasiyab could not cease from gazing upon Saiawush, and all 
<A NAME="383"></A>that he had he placed it at his command. He gave to him a palace, and rich 
<A NAME="384"></A>brocades, and jewels and gold past the counting; and he prepared for him 
<A NAME="385"></A>a feast, and there were played the games of skill, and Saiawush showed 
<A NAME="386"></A>his prowess before Afrasiyab. And the sight of Saiawush became a light 
<A NAME="387"></A>to the eyes of the King of Turan and a joy unto his heart, and he loved 
<A NAME="388"></A>him like to a father. And Saiawush abode within his courts many days, and 
<A NAME="389"></A>in gladness and in sorrow, in gaiety or in sadness, Afrasiyab would have 
<A NAME="390"></A>none other about him. And the name of Saiawush abode ever upon his lips. 
<A NAME="391"></A>And in this wise there rolled twelve moons over their heads, and in the 
<A NAME="392"></A>end Saiawush took unto himself to wife the daughter of Piran the Pehliva. 
<A NAME="393"></A>And yet again the heavens revolved above his head, and he continued to 
<A NAME="394"></A>abide within the house of Afrasiyab. Then Piran gave counsel unto Saiawush 
<A NAME="395"></A>that he should ask of Afrasiyab the hand of his daughter to wife. For he 
<A NAME="396"></A>said-
<A NAME="397"></A><BR><BR>"Thy home is now in Turan, wherefore it behoveth thee to establish 
<A NAME="398"></A>thy might; and if Afrasiyab be thy father indeed, there can no hurt come 
<A NAME="399"></A>near to thee. And peradventure, if a son be born unto thee of the daughter 
<A NAME="400"></A>of Afrasiyab, he will bind up for ever the enmity of the 
<A NAME="401"></A>lands."
<A NAME="402"></A><BR><BR>And Saiawush listened to the counsel of Piran, for he knew that 
<A NAME="403"></A>it was good, and he asked the hand of Ferangis of her father, and Afrasiyab 
<A NAME="404"></A>gave it to him with great joy. Then a mighty feast was made for the bridal, 
<A NAME="405"></A>and Afrasiyab poured gifts upon Saiawush past the telling, and he bestowed 
<A NAME="406"></A>on him a kingdom and a throne, and he blessed him as his son; and when 
<A NAME="407"></A>at length he suffered him to go forth unto his realm, he sorrowed sore 
<A NAME="408"></A>at his loss.
<A NAME="409"></A><BR><BR>Now the space of one year did Saiawush abide in his province, and 
<A NAME="410"></A>at the end thereof, when he had visited its breadth, he builded for himself 
<A NAME="411"></A>a city in the midst. And he named it Gangdis, and it was a place of beauty, 
<A NAME="412"></A>such as the world hath not seen the like. And Saiawush built houses and 
<A NAME="413"></A>planted trees without number, and he also caused an open space to be made 
<A NAME="414"></A>wherein men could rejoice in the game of ball. And he was glad in the possession 
<A NAME="415"></A>of this city, and all men around him rejoiced, and the earth was the happier 
<A NAME="416"></A>for his presence, and there was no cloud upon the heaven of his life. Yet 
<A NAME="417"></A>the Mubids told unto him that Gangdis would lead to his ill-fortune, and 
<A NAME="418"></A>Saiawush was afflicted thereat. But when a little time was sped and he 
<A NAME="419"></A>beheld no evil, he put from him their words, and he rejoiced in the time 
<A NAME="420"></A>that was; and he was glad in the house of his women, and he put his trust 
<A NAME="421"></A>in Afrasiyab.
<A NAME="422"></A><BR><BR>But that which is written in the stars, surely it must be accomplished! 
<A NAME="423"></A>So it came about after many years that Gersiwaz was jealous of the love 
<A NAME="424"></A>which Afrasiyab his brother bare unto Saiawush, and of the power that was 
<A NAME="425"></A>his; and he pondered in his heart how he might destroy him. Then he came 
<A NAME="426"></A>before Afrasiyab, and prayed the King that he would suffer him to go forth 
<A NAME="427"></A>and visit the city that Saiawush had builded, whereof the mouths of men 
<A NAME="428"></A>ran over in praises. And Afrasiyab granted his request, and bade him bear 
<A NAME="429"></A>words of love unto Saiawush his son. So Gersiwaz sped forth unto the city 
<A NAME="430"></A>of Gangdis, and the master thereof received him kindly, and asked him tidings 
<A NAME="431"></A>of the King. And he feasted him many days within his house, and he showed 
<A NAME="432"></A>freely unto him all that was his; and when he departed he heaped gifts 
<A NAME="433"></A>upon his head, for he knew not that Gersiwaz came in enmity unto him, and 
<A NAME="434"></A>that these things but fanned his envy.
<A NAME="435"></A><BR><BR>Now when Gersiwaz returned unto Afrasiyab, the King questioned 
<A NAME="436"></A>him concerning his darling. Then Gersiwaz answered and 
<A NAME="437"></A>said-
<A NAME="438"></A><BR><BR>"O King, he is no longer the man whom thou knewest. His spirit 
<A NAME="439"></A>is uplifted in pride of might, and his heart goeth out towards Iran. And 
<A NAME="440"></A>but that I should make my name to be infamous unto the nations, I would 
<A NAME="441"></A>have hidden from thee this grief. But it behoveth me to tell unto thee 
<A NAME="442"></A>that which I have seen and which mine ears have heard. For it hath been 
<A NAME="443"></A>made known unto me that Saiawush is in treaty with his father, and that 
<A NAME="444"></A>they seek to destroy thee utterly."
<A NAME="445"></A><BR><BR>When Afrasiyab heard these words he would not let them take root 
<A NAME="446"></A>in his spirit, yet he could not refuse countenance to the testimony of 
<A NAME="447"></A>his brother. And he was sad, and spake not, and Gersiwaz knew not whether 
<A NAME="448"></A>the seeds he had strewn had taken root. So when a few days were gone by 
<A NAME="449"></A>he came again before the King and repeated unto him the charges that he 
<A NAME="450"></A>had made, and he urged him to act, and suffer not Turan to be disgraced. 
<A NAME="451"></A>Then Afrasiyab was caught in the meshes of the net that Gersiwaz had spread. 
<A NAME="452"></A>And he bade Gersiwaz go forth and summon Saiawush unto his courts, and 
<A NAME="453"></A>invite him to bring the daughter of Afrasiyab to feast with her father. 
<A NAME="454"></A>And Gersiwaz sped forth with gladness, and delivered the message of Afrasiyab 
<A NAME="455"></A>unto the young King. Then Saiawush said-
<A NAME="456"></A><BR><BR>"I am ready to do the will of Afrasiyab, and the bridle of my horse 
<A NAME="457"></A>is tied unto thy charger."
<A NAME="458"></A><BR><BR>Then Gersiwaz thought within him, "If Saiawush come into the presence 
<A NAME="459"></A>of Afrasiyab, his courage and open spirit will give the lie unto my 
<A NAME="460"></A>words."
<A NAME="461"></A><BR><BR>So he feigned before Saiawush a great sorrow, and when the King 
<A NAME="462"></A>questioned him thereof he consented to pour out before him the griefs of 
<A NAME="463"></A>his spirit. And he said to him how that he loved him tenderly, and how 
<A NAME="464"></A>he was in sorrow for his sake, because that the ear of Afrasiyab had been 
<A NAME="465"></A>poisoned against him, and he counselled him that he should not seek the 
<A NAME="466"></A>courts of the King. And he said-
<A NAME="467"></A><BR><BR>"Suffer me to return alone, and I will soften the heart of Afrasiyab 
<A NAME="468"></A>towards thee; and when he shall be returned unto a right spirit, I will 
<A NAME="469"></A>summon thee forth unto his house."
<A NAME="470"></A><BR><BR>Now Saiawush, who was true and void of guile, listened unto these 
<A NAME="471"></A>words, for he knew not that they were false. So he sent words of greeting 
<A NAME="472"></A>and of excuse unto Afrasiyab, and he said that he could not quit the chamber 
<A NAME="473"></A>of Ferangis, for she was sick and chained unto her couch. And Gersiwaz 
<A NAME="474"></A>rode forth bearing the letter, and he sware unto Saiawush that he would 
<A NAME="475"></A>cement the peace that was broken. But when he came unto Afrasiyab he delivered 
<A NAME="476"></A>not the writing, but spake evil things of Saiawush, and maligned him. And 
<A NAME="477"></A>he fed the anger of Afrasiyab, until the King commanded that the army be 
<A NAME="478"></A>led forth to go against Saiawush his friend, and he took the lead thereof 
<A NAME="479"></A>himself.
<A NAME="480"></A><BR><BR>Now when the men of Turan came nigh unto the city that Saiawush 
<A NAME="481"></A>had builded, Gersiwaz sent an envoy unto Saiawush, saying-
<A NAME="482"></A><BR><BR>"Flee, I counsel thee, for my words have availed nought, and Afrasiyab 
<A NAME="483"></A>cometh forth in enmity against thee."
<A NAME="484"></A><BR><BR>When Saiawush learned this he was sore downcast in his spirit, 
<A NAME="485"></A>and he went unto Ferangis and charged her how she should act when he should 
<A NAME="486"></A>be fallen by the hands of Afrasiyab, for he held it vile to go forth in 
<A NAME="487"></A>combat with one who had been to him a father. So he made ready his house 
<A NAME="488"></A>for death. Now when he came to his steed of battle he pressed its head 
<A NAME="489"></A>unto his breast, and he wept over it and spake into its ear. And he 
<A NAME="490"></A>said-
<A NAME="491"></A><BR><BR>"Listen, O my horse, and be brave and prudent; neither attach thyself 
<A NAME="492"></A>unto any man until the day that Kai Khosrau, my son, shall arise to avenge 
<A NAME="493"></A>me. From him alone receive the saddle and the rein."
<A NAME="494"></A><BR><BR>Then he bade the men of Iran that were about him go back unto their 
<A NAME="495"></A>land, and when all was ready he went forth beyond the gates. But even yet 
<A NAME="496"></A>he hoped to turn from him the suspicions of Afrasiyab, and he would not 
<A NAME="497"></A>suffer his men to offer combat unto the men of Turan. So he went before 
<A NAME="498"></A>Afrasiyab, and questioned him wherefore he was come out in anger against 
<A NAME="499"></A>him. Now Gersiwaz suffered not Afrasiyab to reply, but heaped reproaches 
<A NAME="500"></A>upon Saiawush, and said that he had received him vilely, and that he had 
<A NAME="501"></A>slandered his benefactor. And Saiawush, when he had listened, was confounded, 
<A NAME="502"></A>and in vain did he strive to bear down the upbraiding of his foe. For the 
<A NAME="503"></A>heart of Afrasiyab was angered yet the more, now that his eyes rested yet 
<A NAME="504"></A>again upon the face of Saiawush, whom he loved, because he deemed that 
<A NAME="505"></A>he must give credit unto the words of his brother, and because distrust 
<A NAME="506"></A>of Iran was graven in his soul. So he hardened himself against the speech 
<A NAME="507"></A>of Saiawush, and he bade the army fall upon his beloved. But Saiawush remembered 
<A NAME="508"></A>his oath, and he stretched not forth his hand against Afrasiyab, neither 
<A NAME="509"></A>did he defend himself from the assaults of his men, and he bade the warriors 
<A NAME="510"></A>that were with him that they unsheathe not the sword. So speedily were 
<A NAME="511"></A>they mown down, and their bodies lay round about Saiawush their King. And 
<A NAME="512"></A>when all were slain a knight stretched out his hand against Saiawush, yet 
<A NAME="513"></A>he slew him not, but bound him with cords, and led him before Afrasiyab 
<A NAME="514"></A>the King. And Afrasiyab commanded that Saiawush be led forth into a desert 
<A NAME="515"></A>place, and that his head be severed from off his trunk. Now the army murmured 
<A NAME="516"></A>when they heard this command, and beheld the beauty of Saiawush and his 
<A NAME="517"></A>face of truth, and there stepped forth one from among the nobles to plead 
<A NAME="518"></A>for him. But Gersiwaz would not suffer the heart of Afrasiyab to be 
<A NAME="519"></A>softened.
<A NAME="520"></A><BR><BR>Now while Gersiwaz yet spake evil of the young King, there came 
<A NAME="521"></A>forth from the house of the women Ferangis, the daughter of Afrasiyab, 
<A NAME="522"></A>and she demanded audience of her father. And when he would have denied 
<A NAME="523"></A>it, she forced herself into his presence, and she pleaded for her lord, 
<A NAME="524"></A>and she sware that evil tongues had maligned him, and she entreated of 
<A NAME="525"></A>her father that he would not destroy the joy he had given to her. And she 
<A NAME="526"></A>said-
<A NAME="527"></A><BR><BR>"Listen, O King! if thou destroyest Saiawush, thou becomest a foe 
<A NAME="528"></A>unto thyself. Deliver not by thy folly the land of Turan unto the winds, 
<A NAME="529"></A>and remember the deeds that have been done of Iran in the days that are 
<A NAME="530"></A>gone by. An avenger will arise from out the midst of the Kaianides. Mayest 
<A NAME="531"></A>thou never recall my counsel too late."
<A NAME="532"></A><BR><BR>But the world grew dark before the eyes of Afrasiyab with anger. 
<A NAME="533"></A>And he spake, and said-
<A NAME="534"></A><BR><BR>"Go hence, and trouble not again my face; for how canst thou judge 
<A NAME="535"></A>of that which is right?"
<A NAME="536"></A><BR><BR>Then he commanded that she should be bound, and cast into a 
<A NAME="537"></A>dungeon.
<A NAME="538"></A><BR><BR>Now Gersiwaz, when he beheld the anger of the King, deemed that 
<A NAME="539"></A>the time was ripe. He therefore gave a sign unto the men that held Saiawush 
<A NAME="540"></A>in bondage, and desired that they should slay him. And by the hairs of 
<A NAME="541"></A>his head they dragged him unto a desert place, and the sword of Gersiwaz 
<A NAME="542"></A>was planted in the breast of the royal cedar. But when it was done, and 
<A NAME="543"></A>they had severed the head from the trunk, a mighty storm arose over the 
<A NAME="544"></A>earth, and the heavens were darkened. Then they trembled and were sore 
<A NAME="545"></A>afraid, and repented them of their deed. And clamour arose in the house 
<A NAME="546"></A>of Saiawush, and the cries of Ferangis reached even unto Afrasiyab her 
<A NAME="547"></A>father. Then the King commanded that she should be killed also. But Piran 
<A NAME="548"></A>spake, and said-
<A NAME="549"></A><BR><BR>"Not so, wicked and foolish man. Wouldst thou lift thine hand against 
<A NAME="550"></A>thine offspring, and hast thou not done enough that is evil? Shed not, 
<A NAME="551"></A>I counsel thee, the blood of yet another innocent. But if thou desire to 
<A NAME="552"></A>look no more upon Ferangis, I pray thee confide her unto me, that she may 
<A NAME="553"></A>be to me a daughter in my house, and I will guard her from 
<A NAME="554"></A>sorrow."
<A NAME="555"></A><BR><BR>Then Afrasiyab said, "Do that which seemeth best in thy 
<A NAME="556"></A>sight."
<A NAME="557"></A><BR>And he was glad in his heart, for he desired not to look upon the face 
<A NAME="558"></A>that should recall to him the friend that he had loved. So Piran took Ferangis 
<A NAME="559"></A>unto his house beyond the mountains, and Afrasiyab returned unto his courts. 
<A NAME="560"></A>But the King was sorrowful in his spirit and unquiet in his heart, and 
<A NAME="561"></A>he could not cease from thinking of Saiawush, and he repented of that which 
<A NAME="562"></A>he had done.
