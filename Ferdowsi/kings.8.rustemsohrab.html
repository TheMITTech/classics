<A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A>Give ear unto the combat of Sohrab against Rustem, though it be a tale 
<A NAME="11"></A>replete with tears.
<A NAME="12"></A><BR><BR>It came about that on a certain day Rustem arose from his couch, 
<A NAME="13"></A>and his mind was filled with forebodings. He bethought him therefore to 
<A NAME="14"></A>go out to the chase. So he saddled Rakush and made ready his quiver with 
<A NAME="15"></A>arrows. Then he turned him unto the wilds that lie near Turan, even in 
<A NAME="16"></A>the direction of the city of Samengan. And when he was come nigh unto it, 
<A NAME="17"></A>he started a herd of asses and made sport among them till that he was weary 
<A NAME="18"></A>of the hunt. Then he caught one and slew it and roasted it for his meal, 
<A NAME="19"></A>and when he had eaten it and broken the bones for the marrow, he laid himself 
<A NAME="20"></A>down to slumber, and Rakush cropped the pasture beside 
<A NAME="21"></A>him.
<A NAME="22"></A><BR><BR>Now while the hero was sleeping there passed by seven knights of 
<A NAME="23"></A>Turan, and they beheld Rakush and coveted him. So they threw their cords 
<A NAME="24"></A>at him to ensnare him. But Rakush, when he beheld their design, pawed the 
<A NAME="25"></A>ground in anger, and fell upon them as he had fallen upon the lion. And 
<A NAME="26"></A>of one man he bit off the head, and another he struck down under his hoofs, 
<A NAME="27"></A>and he would have overcome them all, but they were too many. So they ensnared 
<A NAME="28"></A>him and led him into the city, thinking in their hearts, "Verily a goodly 
<A NAME="29"></A>capture have we made." But Rustem when he awoke from his slumbers was downcast 
<A NAME="30"></A>and sore grieved when he saw not his steed, and he said unto 
<A NAME="31"></A>himself-
<A NAME="32"></A><BR><BR>"How can I stand against the Turks, and how can I traverse the 
<A NAME="33"></A>desert alone?"
<A NAME="34"></A><BR><BR>And his heart was full of trouble. Then he sought for the traces 
<A NAME="35"></A>of the horse's hoofs, and he followed them, and they led him even unto 
<A NAME="36"></A>the gates of the city. Now when those within beheld Rustem, and that he 
<A NAME="37"></A>came before them on foot, the King and the nobles came forth to greet him, 
<A NAME="38"></A>and inquired of him how this was come about. Then Rustem told them how 
<A NAME="39"></A>Rakush was vanished while he slumbered, and how he had followed his track 
<A NAME="40"></A>even unto these gates. And he sware a great oath, and vowed that if his 
<A NAME="41"></A>courser were not restored unto him many heads should quit their trunks. 
<A NAME="42"></A>Then the King of Samengan, when he saw that Rustem was beside himself with 
<A NAME="43"></A>anger, spoke words of soothing, and said that none of his people should 
<A NAME="44"></A>do wrong unto the hero; and he begged him that he would enter into his 
<A NAME="45"></A>house and abide with him until that search had been made, 
<A NAME="46"></A>saying-
<A NAME="47"></A><BR><BR>"Surely Rakush cannot be hid."
<A NAME="48"></A><BR>And Rustem was satisfied at these words, and cast suspicion from his 
<A NAME="49"></A>spirit, and entered the house of the King, and feasted with him, and beguiled 
<A NAME="50"></A>the hours with wine. And the King rejoiced in his guest, and encompassed 
<A NAME="51"></A>him with sweet singers and all honour. And when the night was fallen the 
<A NAME="52"></A>King himself led Rustem unto a couch perfumed with musk and roses, and 
<A NAME="53"></A>he bade him slumber sweetly until the morning. And he declared to him yet 
<A NAME="54"></A>again that all was well for him and for his steed.
<A NAME="55"></A><BR><BR>Now when a portion of the night was spent, and the star of morning 
<A NAME="56"></A>stood high in the arch of heaven, the door of Rustem's chamber was opened, 
<A NAME="57"></A>and a murmur of soft voices came in from the threshold. And there stepped 
<A NAME="58"></A>within a slave bearing a lamp perfumed with amber, and a woman whose beauty 
<A NAME="59"></A>was veiled came after her. And as she moved musk was scattered from her 
<A NAME="60"></A>robes. And the women came nigh unto the bed of the hero heavy with wine 
<A NAME="61"></A>and slumber. And he was amazed when he saw them. And when he had roused 
<A NAME="62"></A>him somewhat he spake and said-
<A NAME="63"></A><BR><BR>"Who art thou, and what is thy name and thy desire, and what seekest 
<A NAME="64"></A>thou from me in the dark night?"
<A NAME="65"></A><BR><BR>Then the Peri-faced answered him, saying, "I am Tahmineh, the daughter 
<A NAME="66"></A>of the King of Samengan, of the race of the leopard and the lion, and none 
<A NAME="67"></A>of the princes of this earth are worthy of my hand, neither hath any man 
<A NAME="68"></A>seen me unveiled. But my heart is torn with anguish, and my spirit is tossed 
<A NAME="69"></A>with desire, for I have heard of thy deeds of prowess, and how thou fearest 
<A NAME="70"></A>neither Deev nor lion, neither leopard nor crocodile, and how thy hand 
<A NAME="71"></A>is swift to strike, and how thou didst venture alone into Mazinderan, and 
<A NAME="72"></A>how wild asses are devoured of thee, and how the earth groaneth under the 
<A NAME="73"></A>tread of thy feet, and how men perish at thy blows, and how even the eagle 
<A NAME="74"></A>dareth not swoop down upon her prey when she beholdeth thy sword. These 
<A NAME="75"></A>things and more have they told unto me, and mine eyes have yearned to look 
<A NAME="76"></A>upon thy face. And now hath God brought thee within the gates of my father, 
<A NAME="77"></A>and I am come to say unto thee that I am thine if thou wilt hear me, and 
<A NAME="78"></A>if thou wilt not, none other will I espouse. And consider, O Pehliva, how 
<A NAME="79"></A>that love hath obscured mine understanding and withdrawn me from the bosom 
<A NAME="80"></A>of discretion, yet peradventure God will grant unto me a son like to thee 
<A NAME="81"></A>for strength and valour, to whom shall be given the empire of the world. 
<A NAME="82"></A>And if thou wilt listen unto me, I will lead forth before thee Rakush thy 
<A NAME="83"></A>steed, and I will place under thy feet the land of Samengan."
<A NAME="84"></A><BR><BR>Now while this moon of beauty was yet speaking, Rustem regarded 
<A NAME="85"></A>her. And he saw that she was fair, and that wisdom abode in her mind; and 
<A NAME="86"></A>when he heard of Rakush, his spirit was decided within him, and he held 
<A NAME="87"></A>that this adventure could not end save gloriously. So he sent a Mubid unto 
<A NAME="88"></A>the King and demanded the hand of Tahmineh from her father. And the King, 
<A NAME="89"></A>when he heard the news, was rejoiced, and gave his daughter unto the Pehliva, 
<A NAME="90"></A>and they concluded an alliance according to custom and the rites. And all 
<A NAME="91"></A>men, young and old, within the house and city of the King were glad at 
<A NAME="92"></A>this alliance, and called down blessings upon Rustem.
<A NAME="93"></A><BR><BR>Now Rustem, when he was alone with the Peri-faced, took from his 
<A NAME="94"></A>arm an onyx that was known unto all the world. And he gave it to her, and 
<A NAME="95"></A>said-
<A NAME="96"></A><BR><BR>"Cherish this jewel, and if Heaven cause thee to give birth unto 
<A NAME="97"></A>a daughter, fasten it within her locks, and it will shield her from evil; 
<A NAME="98"></A>but if it be granted unto thee to bring forth a son, fasten it upon his 
<A NAME="99"></A>arm, that he may wear it like his father. And he shall be strong as Keriman, 
<A NAME="100"></A>of stature like unto Saum the son of Neriman, and of grace of speech like 
<A NAME="101"></A>unto Zal, my father."
<A NAME="102"></A><BR><BR>The Peri-faced, when she had heard these words, was glad in his 
<A NAME="103"></A>presence. But when the day was passed there came in unto them the King 
<A NAME="104"></A>her father, and he told Rustem how that tidings of Rakush were come unto 
<A NAME="105"></A>his ears, and how that the courser would shortly be within the gates. And 
<A NAME="106"></A>Rustem, when he heard it, was filled with longing after his steed, and 
<A NAME="107"></A>when he knew that he was come he hastened forth to caress him. And with 
<A NAME="108"></A>his own hands he fastened the saddle, and gave thanks unto Ormuzd, who 
<A NAME="109"></A>had restored his joy between his hands. Then he knew that the time to depart 
<A NAME="110"></A>was come. And he opened his arms and took unto his heart Tahmineh the fair 
<A NAME="111"></A>of face, and he bathed her cheek with his tears and covered her hair with 
<A NAME="112"></A>kisses. Then he flung him upon Rakush, and the swift-footed bare him quickly 
<A NAME="113"></A>from out of her sight. And Tahmineh was sorrowful exceedingly, and Rustem 
<A NAME="114"></A>too was filled with thoughts as he turned him back into Zaboulistan. And 
<A NAME="115"></A>he pondered this adventure in his heart, but to no man did he speak of 
<A NAME="116"></A>what he had seen or done.
<A NAME="117"></A><BR><BR>Now when nine moons had run their course there was born unto Tahmineh 
<A NAME="118"></A>a son in the likeness of his father, a babe whose mouth was filled with 
<A NAME="119"></A>smiles, wherefore men called him Sohrab. And when he numbered but one month 
<A NAME="120"></A>he was like unto a child of twelve, and when he numbered five years he 
<A NAME="121"></A>was skilled in arms and all the arts of war, and when ten years were rolled 
<A NAME="122"></A>above his head there was none in the land that could resist him in the 
<A NAME="123"></A>games of strength. Then he came before his mother and spake words of daring. 
<A NAME="124"></A>And he said-
<A NAME="125"></A><BR><BR>"Since I am taller and stouter than my peers, teach unto me my 
<A NAME="126"></A>race and lineage, and what I shall say when men ask me the name of my sire. 
<A NAME="127"></A>But if thou refuse an answer unto my demands, I will strike thee out from 
<A NAME="128"></A>the rolls of the living."
<A NAME="129"></A><BR><BR>When Tahmineh beheld the ardour of her son, she smiled in her spirit 
<A NAME="130"></A>because that his fire was like to that of his father. And she opened her 
<A NAME="131"></A>mouth and said-
<A NAME="132"></A><BR><BR>"Hear my words, O my son, and be glad in thine heart, neither give 
<A NAME="133"></A>way in thy spirit to anger. For thou art the offspring of Rustem, thou 
<A NAME="134"></A>art descended from the seed of Saum and Zal, and Neriman was thy forefather. 
<A NAME="135"></A>And since God made the world it hath held none like unto Rustem, thy 
<A NAME="136"></A>sire."
<A NAME="137"></A><BR><BR>Then she showed to him a letter written by the Pehliva, and gave 
<A NAME="138"></A>to him the gold and jewels Rustem had sent at his birth. And she spake 
<A NAME="139"></A>and said-
<A NAME="140"></A><BR><BR>"Cherish these gifts with gratitude, for it is thy father who hath 
<A NAME="141"></A>sent them. Yet remember, O my son, that thou close thy lips concerning 
<A NAME="142"></A>these things; for Turan groaneth under the hand of Afrasiyab, and he is 
<A NAME="143"></A>foe unto Rustem the glorious. If, therefore, he should learn of thee, he 
<A NAME="144"></A>would seek to destroy the son for hatred of the sire. Moreover, O my boy, 
<A NAME="145"></A>if Rustem learned that thou wert become a mountain of valour, perchance 
<A NAME="146"></A>he would demand thee at my hands, and the sorrow of thy loss would crush 
<A NAME="147"></A>the heart of thy mother."
<A NAME="148"></A><BR><BR>But Sohrab replied, "Nought can be hidden upon earth for aye. To 
<A NAME="149"></A>all men are known the deeds of Rustem, and since my birth be thus noble, 
<A NAME="150"></A>wherefore hast thou kept it dark from me so long? I will go forth with 
<A NAME="151"></A>an army of brave Turks and lead them unto Iran, I will cast Kai Kaous from 
<A NAME="152"></A>off his throne, I will give to Rustem the crown of the Kaianides, and together 
<A NAME="153"></A>we will subdue the land of Turan, and Afrasiyab shall be slain by my hands. 
<A NAME="154"></A>Then will I mount the throne in his stead. But thou shalt be called Queen 
<A NAME="155"></A>of Iran. for since Rustem is my father and I am his son no other kings 
<A NAME="156"></A>shall rule in this world, for to us alone behoveth it to wear the crowns 
<A NAME="157"></A>of might. And I pant in longing after the battlefield, and I desire that 
<A NAME="158"></A>the world should behold my prowess. But a horse is needful unto me, a steed 
<A NAME="159"></A>tall and strong of power to bear me, for it beseemeth me not to go on foot 
<A NAME="160"></A>before mine enemies."
<A NAME="161"></A><BR><BR>Now Tahmineh, when she had heard the words of this boy, rejoiced 
<A NAME="162"></A>in her soul at his courage. So she bade the guardians of the flocks lead 
<A NAME="163"></A>out the horses before Sohrab her son. And they did as she had bidden, and 
<A NAME="164"></A>Sohrab surveyed the steeds, and tested their strength like as his father 
<A NAME="165"></A>had done before him of old, and he bowed them under his hand, and he could 
<A NAME="166"></A>not be satisfied. And thus for many days did he seek a worthy steed. Then 
<A NAME="167"></A>one came before him and told of a foal sprung from Rakush, the swift of 
<A NAME="168"></A>foot. When Sohrab heard the tidings he smiled, and bade that the foal be 
<A NAME="169"></A>led before him. And he tested it and found it to be strong. So he saddled 
<A NAME="170"></A>it and sprang upon its back and cried, saying-
<A NAME="171"></A><BR><BR>"Now that I own a horse like thee, the world shall be made dark 
<A NAME="172"></A>to many."
<A NAME="173"></A><BR><BR>Then he made ready for war against Iran, and the nobles and warriors 
<A NAME="174"></A>flocked around him. And when all was in order Sohrab came before his grandsire 
<A NAME="175"></A>and craved his counsel and his aid to go forth into the land of Iran and 
<A NAME="176"></A>seek out his father. And the King of Samengan, when he heard these wishes, 
<A NAME="177"></A>deemed them to be just, and he opened the doors of his treasures without 
<A NAME="178"></A>stint and gave unto Sohrab of his wealth, for he was filled with pleasure 
<A NAME="179"></A>at this boy. And he invested Sohrab with all the honours of a King, and 
<A NAME="180"></A>he bestowed on him all the marks of his good pleasure.
<A NAME="181"></A><BR><BR>Meantime a certain man brought news unto Afrasiyab that Sohrab 
<A NAME="182"></A>was making ready an army to fall upon Iran, and to cast Kai Kaous from 
<A NAME="183"></A>off his throne. And he told Afrasiyab how the courage and valour of Sohrab 
<A NAME="184"></A>exceeded words. And Afrasiyab, when he heard this, hid not his contentment, 
<A NAME="185"></A>and he called before him Human and Barman, the doughty. Then he bade them 
<A NAME="186"></A>gather together an army and join the ranks of Sohrab, and he confided to 
<A NAME="187"></A>them his secret purpose, but he enjoined them to tell no man thereof. For 
<A NAME="188"></A>he said-
<A NAME="189"></A><BR><BR>"Into our hands hath it been given to settle the course of the 
<A NAME="190"></A>world. For it is known unto me that Sohrab is sprung from Rustem the Pehliva, 
<A NAME="191"></A>but from Rustem must it be hidden who it is that goeth out against him, 
<A NAME="192"></A>then peradventure he will perish by the hands of this young lion, and Iran, 
<A NAME="193"></A>devoid of Rustem, will fall a prey into my hands. Then will we subdue Sohrab 
<A NAME="194"></A>also, and all the world will be ours. But if it be written that Sohrab 
<A NAME="195"></A>fall under the hand of Tehemten, then the grief he shall endure when he 
<A NAME="196"></A>shall learn that he hath slain his son will bring him to the grave for 
<A NAME="197"></A>sorrow."
<A NAME="198"></A><BR><BR>So spake Afrasiyab in his guile, and when he had done unveiling 
<A NAME="199"></A>his black heart he bade the warriors depart unto Samengan. And they bare 
<A NAME="200"></A>with them gifts of great price to pour before the face of Sohrab. And they 
<A NAME="201"></A>bare also a letter filled with soft words. And in the letter Afrasiyab 
<A NAME="202"></A>lauded Sohrab for his resolve, and told him how that if Iran be subdued 
<A NAME="203"></A>the world would henceforth know peace, for upon his own head would he place 
<A NAME="204"></A>the crown of the Kaianides; and Turan, Iran, and Samengan should be as 
<A NAME="205"></A>one land.
<A NAME="206"></A><BR><BR>When Sohrab had read this letter, and saw the gifts and the aid 
<A NAME="207"></A>sent out to him, he rejoiced aloud, for he deemed that now none could withstand 
<A NAME="208"></A>his might. So he caused the cymbals of departure to be clashed, and the 
<A NAME="209"></A>army made them ready to go forth. Then Sohrab led them into the land of 
<A NAME="210"></A>Iran. And their track was marked by desolation and destruction, for they 
<A NAME="211"></A>spared nothing that they passed. And they spread fire and dismay abroad, 
<A NAME="212"></A>and they marched on unstayed until they came unto the White Castle, the 
<A NAME="213"></A>fortress wherein Iran put its trust.
<A NAME="214"></A><BR><BR>Now the guardian of the castle was named Hujir, and there lived 
<A NAME="215"></A>with him Gustahem the brave, but he was grown old, and could aid no longer 
<A NAME="216"></A>save with his counsels. And there abode also his daughter Gurdafrid, a 
<A NAME="217"></A>warlike maid, firm in the saddle, and practised in the fight. Now when 
<A NAME="218"></A>Hujir beheld from afar a dusky cloud of armed men he came forth to meet 
<A NAME="219"></A>them. And Sohrab, when he saw him, drew his sword, and demanded his name, 
<A NAME="220"></A>and bade him prepare to meet his end. And he taunted him with rashness 
<A NAME="221"></A>that he was come forth thus unaided to stand against a lion. But Hujir 
<A NAME="222"></A>answered Sohrab with taunts again, and vowed that he would sever his head 
<A NAME="223"></A>from his trunk and send it for a trophy unto the Shah. Yet Sohrab only 
<A NAME="224"></A>smiled when he heard these words, and he challenged Hujir to come near. 
<A NAME="225"></A>And they met in combat, and wrestled sore one with another, and stalwart 
<A NAME="226"></A>were their strokes and strong; but Sohrab overcame Hujir as though he were 
<A NAME="227"></A>an infant, and he bound him and sent him captive unto 
<A NAME="228"></A>Human.
<A NAME="229"></A><BR><BR>But when those within the castle learned that their chief was bound 
<A NAME="230"></A>they raised great lamentation, and their fears were sore. And Gurdafrid 
<A NAME="231"></A>too, when she learned it, was grieved, but she was ashamed also for the 
<A NAME="232"></A>fate of Hujir. So she took forth burnished mail and clad herself therein, 
<A NAME="233"></A>and she hid her tresses under a helmet of Roum, and she mounted a steed 
<A NAME="234"></A>of battle and came forth before the walls like to a warrior. And she uttered 
<A NAME="235"></A>a cry of thunder, and flung it amid the ranks of Turan, and she defied 
<A NAME="236"></A>the champions to come forth to single combat. And none came, for they beheld 
<A NAME="237"></A>her how she was strong, and they knew not that it was a woman, and they 
<A NAME="238"></A>were afraid. But Sohrab, when he saw it, stepped forth and 
<A NAME="239"></A>said-
<A NAME="240"></A><BR><BR>"I will accept thy challenge, and a second prize will fall into 
<A NAME="241"></A>my hands."
<A NAME="242"></A><BR><BR>Then he girded himself and made ready for the fight. And the maid, 
<A NAME="243"></A>when she saw he was ready, rained arrows upon him with art, and they fell 
<A NAME="244"></A>quick like hail, and whizzed about his head; and Sohrab, when he saw it, 
<A NAME="245"></A>could not defend himself, and was angry and ashamed. Then he covered his 
<A NAME="246"></A>head with a shield and ran at the maid. But she, when she saw him approach, 
<A NAME="247"></A>dropped her bow and couched a lance, and thrust at Sohrab with vigour, 
<A NAME="248"></A>and shook him mightily, and it wanted little and she would have thrown 
<A NAME="249"></A>him from his seat. And Sohrab was amazed, and his wrath knew no bounds. 
<A NAME="250"></A>Then he ran at Gurdafrid with fury, and seized the reins of her steed, 
<A NAME="251"></A>and caught her by the waist, and tore her armour, and threw her upon the 
<A NAME="252"></A>ground. Yet ere he could raise his hand to strike her, she drew her sword 
<A NAME="253"></A>and shivered his lance in twain, and leaped again upon her steed. And when 
<A NAME="254"></A>she saw that the day was hers, she was weary of further combat, and she 
<A NAME="255"></A>sped back unto the fortress. But Sohrab gave rein unto his horse, and followed 
<A NAME="256"></A>after her in his great anger. And he caught her, and seized her, and tore 
<A NAME="257"></A>the helmet from off her head, for he desired to look upon the face of the 
<A NAME="258"></A>man who could withstand the son of Rustem. And lo! when he had done so, 
<A NAME="259"></A>there rolled forth from the helmet coils of dusky hue, and Sohrab beheld 
<A NAME="260"></A>it was a woman that had overcome him in the fight. And he was confounded. 
<A NAME="261"></A>But when he had found speech he said-
<A NAME="262"></A><BR><BR>"If the daughters of Iran are like to thee, and go forth unto battle, 
<A NAME="263"></A>none can stand against this land."
<A NAME="264"></A><BR><BR>Then he took his cord and threw it about her, and bound her in 
<A NAME="265"></A>its snare, saying-
<A NAME="266"></A><BR><BR>"Seek not to escape me, O moon of beauty, for never hath prey like 
<A NAME="267"></A>unto thee fallen between my hands."
<A NAME="268"></A><BR><BR>Then Gurdafrid, full of wile, turned unto him her face that was 
<A NAME="269"></A>unveiled, for she beheld no other means of safety, and she said unto 
<A NAME="270"></A>him-
<A NAME="271"></A><BR><BR>"O hero without flaw, is it well that thou shouldest seek to make 
<A NAME="272"></A>me captive, and show me unto the army? For they have beheld our combat, 
<A NAME="273"></A>and that I overcame thee, and surely now they will gibe when they learn 
<A NAME="274"></A>that thy strength was withstood by a woman. Better would it beseem thee 
<A NAME="275"></A>to hide this adventure, lest thy cheeks have cause to blush because of 
<A NAME="276"></A>me. Therefore let us conclude a peace together. The castle shall be thine, 
<A NAME="277"></A>and all it holds; follow after me then, and take possession of thine 
<A NAME="278"></A>own."
<A NAME="279"></A><BR><BR>Now Sohrab, when he had listened, was beguiled by her words and 
<A NAME="280"></A>her beauty, and he said-
<A NAME="281"></A><BR><BR>"Thou dost wisely to make peace with me, for verily these walls 
<A NAME="282"></A>could not resist my might."
<A NAME="283"></A><BR><BR>And he followed after her unto the heights of the castle, and he 
<A NAME="284"></A>stood with her before its gates. And Gustahem, when he saw them, opened 
<A NAME="285"></A>the portal, and Gurdafrid stepped within the threshold, but when Sohrab 
<A NAME="286"></A>would have followed after her she shut the door upon him. Then Sohrab saw 
<A NAME="287"></A>that she had befooled him, and his fury knew no bounds. But ere he was 
<A NAME="288"></A>recovered from his surprise she came out upon the battlements and scoffed 
<A NAME="289"></A>at him, and counselled him to go back whence he was come; for surely, since 
<A NAME="290"></A>he could not stand against a woman, he would fall an easy prey before Rustem, 
<A NAME="291"></A>when the Pehliva should have learned that robbers from Turan were broken 
<A NAME="292"></A>into the land. And Sohrab was made yet madder for her words, and he departed 
<A NAME="293"></A>from the walls in his wrath, and rode far in his anger, and spread terror 
<A NAME="294"></A>in his path. And he vowed that he would yet bring the maid into 
<A NAME="295"></A>subjection.
<A NAME="296"></A><BR><BR>In the meantime Gustahem the aged called before him a scribe, and 
<A NAME="297"></A>bade him write unto Kai Kaous all that was come about, and how an army 
<A NAME="298"></A>was come forth from Turan, at whose head rode a chief that was a child 
<A NAME="299"></A>in years, a lion in strength and stature. And he told how Hujir had been 
<A NAME="300"></A>bound, and how the fortress was like to fall into the hands of the enemy; 
<A NAME="301"></A>for there were none to defend it save only his daughter and himself and 
<A NAME="302"></A>he craved the Shah to come to their aid.
<A NAME="303"></A><BR><BR>Albeit when the day had followed yet again upon the night, Sohrab 
<A NAME="304"></A>made ready his host to fall upon the castle. But when he came near thereto 
<A NAME="305"></A>he found it was empty, and the doors thereof stood open, and no warriors 
<A NAME="306"></A>appeared upon its walls. And he was surprised, for he knew not that in 
<A NAME="307"></A>the darkness the inmates were fled by a passage that was hidden under the 
<A NAME="308"></A>earth. And he searched the building for Gurdafrid, for his heart yearned 
<A NAME="309"></A>after her in love, and he cried aloud-
<A NAME="310"></A><BR><BR>"Woe, woe is me that this moon is vanished behind the 
<A NAME="311"></A>clouds!"
<A NAME="312"></A><BR>Now when Kai Kaous had gotten the writing of Gustahem, he was sore 
<A NAME="313"></A>afflicted and much afraid, and he called about him his nobles and asked 
<A NAME="314"></A>their counsels. And he said-
<A NAME="315"></A><BR><BR>"Who shall stand against this Turk? For Gustahem doth liken him 
<A NAME="316"></A>in power unto Rustem, and saith he resembleth the seed of 
<A NAME="317"></A>Neriman."
<A NAME="318"></A><BR><BR>Then the warriors cried with one accord, "Unto Rustem alone can 
<A NAME="319"></A>we look in this danger!"
<A NAME="320"></A><BR><BR>And Kai Kaous hearkened to their voice, and he called for a scribe 
<A NAME="321"></A>and dictated unto him a letter. And he wrote unto his Pehliva, and invoked 
<A NAME="322"></A>the blessings of Heaven upon his head, and he told him all that was come 
<A NAME="323"></A>to pass, and how new dangers threatened Iran, and how to Rustem alone could 
<A NAME="324"></A>he look for help in his trouble. And he recalled unto Tehemten all that 
<A NAME="325"></A>he had done for him in the days that were gone by, and he entreated him 
<A NAME="326"></A>once again to be his refuge. And he said-
<A NAME="327"></A><BR><BR>"When thou shalt receive this letter, stay not to speak the word 
<A NAME="328"></A>that hangeth upon thy lips; and if thou bearest roses in thy hands, stop 
<A NAME="329"></A>not to smell them, but haste thee to help us in our 
<A NAME="330"></A>need."
<A NAME="331"></A><BR><BR>Then Kai Kaous sent forth Gew with this writing unto Zaboulistan, 
<A NAME="332"></A>and bade him neither rest nor tarry until he should stand before the face 
<A NAME="333"></A>of Rustem. And he said-
<A NAME="334"></A><BR><BR>"When thou hast done my behest, turn thee again unto me; neither 
<A NAME="335"></A>abide within the courts of the Pehliva, nor linger by the 
<A NAME="336"></A>roadside."
<A NAME="337"></A><BR><BR>And Gew did as the Shah commanded, and took neither food nor rest 
<A NAME="338"></A>till he set foot within the gates of Rustem. And Rustem greeted him kindly, 
<A NAME="339"></A>and asked him of his mission; and when he had read the writing of the Shah, 
<A NAME="340"></A>he questioned Gew concerning Sohrab. For he said-
<A NAME="341"></A><BR><BR>"I should not marvel if such an hero arose in Iran, but that a 
<A NAME="342"></A>warrior of renown should come forth from amid the Turks, I cannot believe 
<A NAME="343"></A>it. But thou sayest none knoweth whence cometh this knight. I have myself 
<A NAME="344"></A>a son in Samengan, but he is yet an infant, and his mother writeth to me 
<A NAME="345"></A>that he rejoiceth in the sports of his age, and though he be like to become 
<A NAME="346"></A>a hero among men, his time is not yet come to lead forth an army. And that 
<A NAME="347"></A>which thou sayest hath been done, surely it is not the work of a babe. 
<A NAME="348"></A>But enter, I pray thee, into my house, and we will confer together concerning 
<A NAME="349"></A>this adventure."
<A NAME="350"></A><BR><BR>Then Rustem bade his cooks make ready a banquet, and he feasted 
<A NAME="351"></A>Gew, and troubled his head with wine, and caused him to forget cares and 
<A NAME="352"></A>time. But when morn was come Gew remembered the commands of the Shah that 
<A NAME="353"></A>he tarry not, but return with all speed, and he spake thereof to Rustem, 
<A NAME="354"></A>and prayed him to make known his resolve. But Rustem spake, 
<A NAME="355"></A>saying-
<A NAME="356"></A><BR><BR>"Disquiet not thyself, for death will surely fall upon these men 
<A NAME="357"></A>of Turan. Stay with me yet another day and rest, and water thy lips that 
<A NAME="358"></A>are parched. For though this Sohrab be a hero like to Saum and Zal and 
<A NAME="359"></A>Neriman, verily he shall fall by my hands."
<A NAME="360"></A><BR><BR>And he made ready yet another banquet, and three days they caroused 
<A NAME="361"></A>without ceasing. But on the fourth Gew uprose with resolve, and came before 
<A NAME="362"></A>Rustem girt for departure. And he said-
<A NAME="363"></A><BR><BR>"It behoveth me to return, O Pehliva, for I bethink me how Kai 
<A NAME="364"></A>Kaous is a man hard and choleric, and the fear of Sohrab weigheth upon 
<A NAME="365"></A>his heart, and his soul burneth with impatience, and he hath lost sleep, 
<A NAME="366"></A>and hath hunger and thirst on this account. And he will be wroth against 
<A NAME="367"></A>us if we delay yet longer to do his behest."
<A NAME="368"></A><BR><BR>Then Rustem said, "Fear not, for none on earth dare be angered 
<A NAME="369"></A>with me."
<A NAME="370"></A><BR><BR>But he did as Gew desired, and made ready his army, and saddled 
<A NAME="371"></A>Rakush, and set forth from Zaboulistan, and a great train followed after 
<A NAME="372"></A>him.
<A NAME="373"></A><BR><BR>Now when they came nigh unto the courts of the Shah, the nobles 
<A NAME="374"></A>came forth to meet them, and do homage before Rustem. And when they were 
<A NAME="375"></A>come in Rustem gat him from Rakush and hastened into the presence of his 
<A NAME="376"></A>lord. But Kai Kaous, when he beheld him, was angry, and spake not, and 
<A NAME="377"></A>his brows were knit with fury; and when Rustem had done obeisance before 
<A NAME="378"></A>him, he unlocked the doors of his mouth, and words of folly escaped his 
<A NAME="379"></A>lips. And he said-
<A NAME="380"></A><BR><BR>"Who is Rustem, that he defieth my power and disregardeth my commands? 
<A NAME="381"></A>If I had a sword within my grasp I would split his head like to an orange. 
<A NAME="382"></A>Seize him, I command, and hang him upon the nearest gallows, and let his 
<A NAME="383"></A>name be never spoken in my presence."
<A NAME="384"></A><BR><BR>When he heard these words Gew trembled in his heart, but he said, 
<A NAME="385"></A>"Dost thou put forth thy hand against Rustem?"
<A NAME="386"></A><BR><BR>And the Shah when he heard it was beside himself, and he cried 
<A NAME="387"></A>with a loud voice that Gew be hanged together with the other; and he bade 
<A NAME="388"></A>Tus lead them forth. And Tus would have led them out, for he hoped the 
<A NAME="389"></A>anger of the Shah would be appeased; but Rustem broke from his grasp and 
<A NAME="390"></A>stood before Kai Kaous, and all the nobles were filled with fear when they 
<A NAME="391"></A>saw his anger. And he flung reproaches at Kai Kaous, and he recalled to 
<A NAME="392"></A>him his follies, and the march into Mazinderan and Hamaveran, and his flight 
<A NAME="393"></A>into Heaven; and he reminded him how that but for Rustem he would not now 
<A NAME="394"></A>be seated upon the throne of light. And he bade him threaten Sohrab the 
<A NAME="395"></A>Turk with his gallows, and he said-
<A NAME="396"></A><BR><BR>"I am a free man and no slave, and am servant alone unto God; and 
<A NAME="397"></A>without Rustem Kai Kaous is as nothing. And the world is subject unto me, 
<A NAME="398"></A>and Rakush is my throne, and my sword is my seal, and my helmet my crown. 
<A NAME="399"></A>And but for me, who called forth Kai Kobad, thine eyes had never looked 
<A NAME="400"></A>upon this throne. And had I desired it I could have sat upon its seat. 
<A NAME="401"></A>But now am I weary of thy follies, and I will turn me away from Iran, and 
<A NAME="402"></A>when this Turk shall have put you under his yoke I shall not learn 
<A NAME="403"></A>thereof."
<A NAME="404"></A><BR><BR>Then he turned him and strode from out the presence-chamber. And 
<A NAME="405"></A>he sprang upon Rakush, who waited without, and he was vanished from before 
<A NAME="406"></A>their eyes ere yet the nobles had rallied from their astonishment. And 
<A NAME="407"></A>they were downcast and oppressed with boding cares, and they held counsel 
<A NAME="408"></A>among themselves what to do; for Rustem was their mainstay, and they knew 
<A NAME="409"></A>that, bereft of his arm and counsel, they could not stand against this 
<A NAME="410"></A>Turk. And they blamed Kai Kaous, and counted over the good deeds that Rustem 
<A NAME="411"></A>had done for him, and they pondered and spake long. And in the end they 
<A NAME="412"></A>resolved to send a messenger unto Kai Kaous, and they chose from their 
<A NAME="413"></A>midst Gudarz the aged, and bade him stand before the Shah. And Gudarz did 
<A NAME="414"></A>as they desired, and he spake long and without fear, and he counted over 
<A NAME="415"></A>each deed that had been done by Rustem; and he reproached the Shah with 
<A NAME="416"></A>his ingratitude, and he said how Rustem was the shepherd, and how the flock 
<A NAME="417"></A>could not be led without its leader. And Kai Kaous heard him unto the end, 
<A NAME="418"></A>and he knew that his words were the words of reason and truth, and he was 
<A NAME="419"></A>ashamed of that which he had done, and confounded when he beheld his acts 
<A NAME="420"></A>thus naked before him. And he humbled himself before Gudarz, and 
<A NAME="421"></A>said-
<A NAME="422"></A><BR><BR>"That which thou sayest, surely it is right."
<A NAME="423"></A><BR>And he entreated Gudarz to go forth and seek Rustem, and bid him forget 
<A NAME="424"></A>the evil words of his Shah, and bring him back to the succour of Iran. 
<A NAME="425"></A>And Gudarz hastened forth to do as Kai Kaous desired, and he told the nobles 
<A NAME="426"></A>of his mission and they joined themselves unto him, and all the chiefs 
<A NAME="427"></A>of Iran went forth in quest of Rustem. And when they had found him, they 
<A NAME="428"></A>prostrated themselves into the dust before him, and Gudarz told him of 
<A NAME="429"></A>his mission, and he prayed him to remember that Kai Kaous was a man devoid 
<A NAME="430"></A>of understanding, whose thoughts flowed over like to new wine that fermenteth. 
<A NAME="431"></A>And he said-
<A NAME="432"></A><BR><BR>"Though Rustem be angered against the King, yet hath the land of 
<A NAME="433"></A>Iran done no wrong that it should perish at his hands. Yet, if Rustem save 
<A NAME="434"></A>it not, surely it will fall under this Turk."
<A NAME="435"></A><BR><BR>But Rustem said, "My patience hath an end, and I fear none but 
<A NAME="436"></A>God. What is this Kai Kaous that he should anger me? and what am I that 
<A NAME="437"></A>I have need of him? I have not deserved the evil words that he spake unto 
<A NAME="438"></A>me, but now will I think of them no longer, but cast aside all thoughts 
<A NAME="439"></A>of Iran."
<A NAME="440"></A><BR><BR>When the nobles heard these words they grew pale, and fear took 
<A NAME="441"></A>hold on their hearts. But Gudarz, full of wisdom, opened his mouth and 
<A NAME="442"></A>said-
<A NAME="443"></A><BR><BR>"O Pehliva! the land, when it shall learn of this, will deem that 
<A NAME="444"></A>Rustem is fled before the face of this Turk; and when men shall believe 
<A NAME="445"></A>that Tehemten is afraid, they will cease to combat, and Iran will be downtrodden 
<A NAME="446"></A>at his hands. Turn thee not, therefore, at this hour from thy allegiance 
<A NAME="447"></A>to the Shah, and tarnish not thy glory by this retreat, neither suffer 
<A NAME="448"></A>that the downfall of Iran rest upon thy head. Put from thee, therefore, 
<A NAME="449"></A>the words that Kai Kaous spake in his empty anger, and lead us forth to 
<A NAME="450"></A>battle against this Turk. For it must not be spoken that Rustem feared 
<A NAME="451"></A>to fight a beardless boy."
<A NAME="452"></A><BR><BR>And Rustem listened and pondered these words in his heart, and 
<A NAME="453"></A>knew that they were good. But he said-
<A NAME="454"></A><BR><BR>"Fear hath never been known of me, neither hath Rustem shunned 
<A NAME="455"></A>the din of arms, and I depart not because of Sohrab, but because that scorn 
<A NAME="456"></A>and insult have been my recompense."
<A NAME="457"></A><BR><BR>Yet when he had pondered a while longer, he saw that he must return 
<A NAME="458"></A>unto the Shah. So he did that which he knew to be right, and he rode till 
<A NAME="459"></A>he came unto the gates of Kai Kaous, and he strode with a proud step into 
<A NAME="460"></A>his presence.
<A NAME="461"></A><BR><BR>Now when the Shah beheld Rustem from afar, he stepped down from 
<A NAME="462"></A>off his throne and came before his Pehliva, and craved his pardon for that 
<A NAME="463"></A>which was come about. And he said how he had been angered because Rustem 
<A NAME="464"></A>had tarried in his coming, and how haste was his birthright, and how he 
<A NAME="465"></A>had forgotten himself in his vexation. But now was his mouth filled with 
<A NAME="466"></A>the dust of repentance. And Rustem said-
<A NAME="467"></A><BR><BR>"The world is the Shah's, and it behoveth thee to do as beseemeth 
<A NAME="468"></A>thee best with thy servants. And until old age shall my loins be girt in 
<A NAME="469"></A>fealty unto thee. And may power and majesty be thine for 
<A NAME="470"></A>ever!"
<A NAME="471"></A><BR><BR>And Kai Kaous answered and said, "O my Pehliva, may thy days be 
<A NAME="472"></A>blessed unto the end!"
<A NAME="473"></A><BR><BR>Then he invited him to feast with him, and they drank wine till 
<A NAME="474"></A>far into the night, and held counsel together how they should act; and 
<A NAME="475"></A>slaves poured rich gifts before Rustem, and the nobles rejoiced, and all 
<A NAME="476"></A>was well again within the gates of the King.
<A NAME="477"></A><BR><BR>Then when the sun had risen and clothed the world with love, the 
<A NAME="478"></A>clarions of war were sounded throughout the city, and men made them ready 
<A NAME="479"></A>to go forth in enmity before the Turks. And the legions of Persia came 
<A NAME="480"></A>forth at the behest of their Shah, and their countless thousands hid the 
<A NAME="481"></A>earth under their feet, and the air was darkened by their spears. And when 
<A NAME="482"></A>they were come unto the plains where stood the fortress of Hujir, they 
<A NAME="483"></A>set up their tents as was their manner. So the watchmen saw them from the 
<A NAME="484"></A>battlements, and he set up a great cry. And Sohrab heard the cry, and questioned 
<A NAME="485"></A>the man wherefore he shouted; and when he learned that the enemy were come, 
<A NAME="486"></A>he rejoiced, and demanded a cup of wine, and drank to their destruction. 
<A NAME="487"></A>Then he called forth Human and showed him the army, and bade him be of 
<A NAME="488"></A>good cheer, for he said that he saw within its ranks no hero of mighty 
<A NAME="489"></A>mace who could stand against himself. So he bade his warriors to a banquet 
<A NAME="490"></A>of wine, and he said that they would feast until the time was come to meet 
<A NAME="491"></A>their foes in battle. And they did as Sohrab said.
<A NAME="492"></A><BR><BR>Now when night had thrown her mantle over the earth, Rustem came 
<A NAME="493"></A>before the Shah and craved that he would suffer him to go forth beyond 
<A NAME="494"></A>the camp that he might see what manner of man was this stripling. And Kai 
<A NAME="495"></A>Kaous granted his request, and said that it was worthy a Pehliva of renown. 
<A NAME="496"></A>Then Rustem went forth disguised in the garb of a Turk, and he entered 
<A NAME="497"></A>the castle in secret, and he came within the chamber where Sohrab held 
<A NAME="498"></A>his feast. Now when he had looked upon the boy he saw that he was like 
<A NAME="499"></A>to a tall cypress of good sap, and that his arms were sinewy and strong 
<A NAME="500"></A>like to the flanks of a camel, and that his stature was that of a hero. 
<A NAME="501"></A>And he saw that round about him stood brave warriors. And slaves with golden 
<A NAME="502"></A>bugles poured wine before them, and they were all glad, neither did they 
<A NAME="503"></A>dream of sorrow. Then it came about that while Rustem regarded them, Zindeh 
<A NAME="504"></A>changed his seat and came nigh unto the spot where Rustem was watching. 
<A NAME="505"></A>Now Zindeh was brother unto Tahmineh, and she had sent him forth with her 
<A NAME="506"></A>son that he might point out to him his father, whom he alone knew of all 
<A NAME="507"></A>the army, and she did it that harm might not befall if the heroes should 
<A NAME="508"></A>meet in battle. Now Zindeh, when he had changed his seat, thought that 
<A NAME="509"></A>he espied a watcher, and he strode towards the place where Rustem was hid, 
<A NAME="510"></A>and he came before him and said-
<A NAME="511"></A><BR><BR>"Who art thou? Come forth into the light that I may behold thy 
<A NAME="512"></A>face."
<A NAME="513"></A><BR><BR>But ere he could speak further, Rustem had lifted up his hand and 
<A NAME="514"></A>struck him, and laid him dead upon the ground.
<A NAME="515"></A><BR><BR>Now Sohrab, when he saw that Zindeh was gone out, was disquieted, 
<A NAME="516"></A>and he asked of his slaves wherefore the hero returned not unto the banquet. 
<A NAME="517"></A>So they went forth to seek him, and when they had found him in his blood, 
<A NAME="518"></A>they came and told Sohrab what they had seen. But Sohrab would not believe 
<A NAME="519"></A>it; so he ran to the spot and bade them bring torches, and all the warriors 
<A NAME="520"></A>and singing girls followed after him. Then when Sohrab saw that it was 
<A NAME="521"></A>true he was sore grieved; but he suffered not that the banquet be ended, 
<A NAME="522"></A>for he would not that the spirits of his men be damped with pity. So they 
<A NAME="523"></A>went back yet again to the feast.
<A NAME="524"></A><BR><BR>Meanwhile Rustem returned him to the camp, and as he would have 
<A NAME="525"></A>entered the lines he encountered Gew, who went around to see that all was 
<A NAME="526"></A>safe. And Gew, when he saw a tall man clad in the garb of a Turk, drew 
<A NAME="527"></A>his sword and held himself ready for combat. But Rustem smiled and opened 
<A NAME="528"></A>his mouth, and Gew knew his voice, and came to him and questioned him what 
<A NAME="529"></A>he did without in the darkness. And Rustem told him. Then he went before 
<A NAME="530"></A>Kai Kaous also and related what he had seen, and how no man like unto Sohrab 
<A NAME="531"></A>was yet come forth from amid the Turks. And he likened him unto Saum, the 
<A NAME="532"></A>son of Neriman.
<A NAME="533"></A><BR><BR>Now when the morning was come, Sohrab put on his armour. Then he 
<A NAME="534"></A>went unto a height whence he could look down over the camp of the Iranians. 
<A NAME="535"></A>And he took with him Hujir, and spake to him, saying-
<A NAME="536"></A><BR><BR>"Seek not to deceive me, nor swerve from the paths of truth. For 
<A NAME="537"></A>if thou reply unto my questions with sincerity, I will loosen thy bonds 
<A NAME="538"></A>and give thee treasures; but if thou deceive me, thou shalt languish till 
<A NAME="539"></A>death in thy chains."
<A NAME="540"></A><BR><BR>And Hujir said, "I will give answer unto thee according to my 
<A NAME="541"></A>knowledge."
<A NAME="542"></A><BR><BR>Then Sohrab said, "I am about to question thee concerning the nobles 
<A NAME="543"></A>whose camps are spread beneath our feet, and thou shalt name unto me those 
<A NAME="544"></A>whom I point out. Behold yon tent of gold brocade, adorned with skins of 
<A NAME="545"></A>leopard, before whose doors stand an hundred elephants of war. Within its 
<A NAME="546"></A>gates is a throne of turquoise, and over it floateth a standard of violet 
<A NAME="547"></A>with a moon and sun worked in its centre. Tell unto me now whose is this 
<A NAME="548"></A>pavilion that standeth thus in the midst of the whole 
<A NAME="549"></A>camp?"
<A NAME="550"></A><BR><BR>And Hujir replied, "It pertaineth unto the Shah of 
<A NAME="551"></A>Iran."
<A NAME="552"></A><BR>Then Sohrab said, "I behold on its right hand yet another tent draped 
<A NAME="553"></A>in the colours of mourning, and above it floateth a standard whereon is 
<A NAME="554"></A>worked an elephant."
<A NAME="555"></A><BR><BR>And Hujir said, "It is the tent of Tus, the son of Nuder, for he 
<A NAME="556"></A>beareth an elephant as his ensign."
<A NAME="557"></A><BR><BR>Then Sohrab said, "Whose is the camp in which stand many warriors 
<A NAME="558"></A>clad in rich armour? A flag of gold with a lion worked upon it waveth along 
<A NAME="559"></A>its field."
<A NAME="560"></A><BR><BR>And Hujir said, "It belongeth unto Gudarz the brave. And those 
<A NAME="561"></A>who stand about it are his sons, for eighty men of might are sprung from 
<A NAME="562"></A>his loins."
<A NAME="563"></A><BR><BR>Then Sohrab said, "To whom belongeth the tent draped with green 
<A NAME="564"></A>tissues? Before its doors is planted the flag of Kawah. I see upon its 
<A NAME="565"></A>throne a Pehliva, nobler of mien than all his fellows, whose head striketh 
<A NAME="566"></A>the stars. And beside him standeth a steed tall as he, and his standard 
<A NAME="567"></A>showeth a lion and a writhing dragon."
<A NAME="568"></A><BR><BR>When Hujir heard this question he thought within himself, "If I 
<A NAME="569"></A>tell unto this lion the signs whereby he may know Rustem the Pehliva, surely 
<A NAME="570"></A>he will fall upon him and seek to destroy him. It will beseem me better, 
<A NAME="571"></A>therefore, to keep silent, and to omit his name from the list of the heroes." 
<A NAME="572"></A>So he said unto Sohrab-
<A NAME="573"></A><BR><BR>"This is some ally who is come unto Kai Kaous from far Cathay, 
<A NAME="574"></A>and his name is not known unto me."
<A NAME="575"></A><BR><BR>And Sohrab when he heard it was downcast, and his heart was sad 
<A NAME="576"></A>that he could nowhere discover Rustem; and though it seemed unto him that 
<A NAME="577"></A>he beheld the marks whereby his mother said that he would know him, he 
<A NAME="578"></A>could not credit the words of his eyes against the words of Hujir. Still 
<A NAME="579"></A>he asked yet again the name of the warrior, and yet again Hujir denied 
<A NAME="580"></A>it unto him, for it was written that that should come to pass which had 
<A NAME="581"></A>been decreed. But Sohrab ceased not from his questionings. And he 
<A NAME="582"></A>asked-
<A NAME="583"></A><BR><BR>"Who dwelleth beneath the standard with the head of a 
<A NAME="584"></A>wolf?"
<A NAME="585"></A><BR>And Hujir said, "It is Gew, the son of Gudarz, who dwelleth within 
<A NAME="586"></A>that tent, and men call him Gew the valiant."
<A NAME="587"></A><BR><BR>Then Sohrab said, "Whose is the seat over which are raised awnings 
<A NAME="588"></A>and brocades of Roum, that glisten with gold in the 
<A NAME="589"></A>sunlight?
<A NAME="590"></A><BR><BR>And Hujir said, "It is the throne of Fraburz, the son of the 
<A NAME="591"></A>Shah."
<A NAME="592"></A><BR><BR>Then Sohrab said, "It beseemeth the son of a Shah to surround himself 
<A NAME="593"></A>with such splendour."
<A NAME="594"></A><BR><BR>And he pointed unto a tent with trappings of yellow that was encircled 
<A NAME="595"></A>by flags of many colours. And he questioned of its owner.
<A NAME="596"></A><BR><BR>And Hujir said, "Guraz the lion-hearted is master 
<A NAME="597"></A>therein."
<A NAME="598"></A><BR>Then Sohrab, when he could not learn the tent of his father, questioned 
<A NAME="599"></A>Hujir concerning Rustem, and he asked yet a third time of the green tent. 
<A NAME="600"></A>Yet Hujir ever replied that he knew not the name of its master. And when 
<A NAME="601"></A>Sohrab pressed him concerning Rustem, he said that Rustem lingered in Zaboulistan, 
<A NAME="602"></A>for it was the feast of roses. But Sohrab refused to give ear unto the 
<A NAME="603"></A>thought that Kai Kaous should go forth to battle without the aid of Rustem, 
<A NAME="604"></A>whose might none could match. So he said unto Hujir-
<A NAME="605"></A><BR><BR>"An thou show not unto me the tents of Rustem, I will strike thy 
<A NAME="606"></A>head from off thy shoulders, and the world shall fade before thine eyes. 
<A NAME="607"></A>Choose, therefore, the truth or thy life."
<A NAME="608"></A><BR><BR>And Hujir thought within himself, "Though five score men cannot 
<A NAME="609"></A>withstand Rustem when he be roused to battle-fury, my mind misgiveth me 
<A NAME="610"></A>that he may have found his equal in this boy. And, for that the stripling 
<A NAME="611"></A>is younger, it might come about that he subdue the Pehliva. What recketh 
<A NAME="612"></A>my life against the weal of Iran? I will therefore abandon me into his 
<A NAME="613"></A>hands rather than show unto him the marks of Rustem the Pehliva." So he 
<A NAME="614"></A>said-
<A NAME="615"></A><BR><BR>"Why seekest thou to know Rustem the Pehliva? Surely thou wilt 
<A NAME="616"></A>know him in battle, and he shall strike thee dumb, and quell thy pride 
<A NAME="617"></A>of youth. Yet I will not show him unto thee."
<A NAME="618"></A><BR><BR>When Sohrab heard these words he raised his sword and smote Hujir, 
<A NAME="619"></A>and made an end of him with a great blow. Then he made himself ready for 
<A NAME="620"></A>fight, and leaped upon his steed of battle, and he rode till he came unto 
<A NAME="621"></A>the camp of the Iranians, and he broke down the barriers with his spear, 
<A NAME="622"></A>and fear seized upon all men when they beheld his stalwart form and majesty 
<A NAME="623"></A>of mien and action. Then Sohrab opened his mouth, and his voice of thunder 
<A NAME="624"></A>was heard even unto the far ends of the camp. And he spake words of pride, 
<A NAME="625"></A>and called forth the Shah to do battle with him, and he sware with a loud 
<A NAME="626"></A>voice that the blood of Zindeh should be avenged. Now when Sohrab's voice 
<A NAME="627"></A>had rung throughout the camp, confusion spread within its borders, and 
<A NAME="628"></A>none of those who stood about the throne would accept his challenge for 
<A NAME="629"></A>the Shah. And with one accord they said that Rustem was their sole support, 
<A NAME="630"></A>and that his sword alone could cause the sun to weep. And Tus sped him 
<A NAME="631"></A>within the courts of Rustem. And Rustem said-
<A NAME="632"></A><BR><BR>"The hardest tasks doth Kai Kaous ever lay upon 
<A NAME="633"></A>me."
<A NAME="634"></A><BR>But the nobles would not suffer him to linger, neither to waste time 
<A NAME="635"></A>in words, and they buckled upon him his armour, and they threw his leopard-skin 
<A NAME="636"></A>about him, and they saddled Rakush, and made ready the hero for the strife. 
<A NAME="637"></A>And they pushed him forth, and called after him-
<A NAME="638"></A><BR><BR>"Haste, haste, for no common combat awaiteth thee, for verily Ahriman 
<A NAME="639"></A>standeth before us."
<A NAME="640"></A><BR><BR>Now when Rustem was come before Sohrab, and beheld the youth, brave 
<A NAME="641"></A>and strong, with a breast like unto Saum, he said to 
<A NAME="642"></A>him-
<A NAME="643"></A><BR><BR>"Let us go apart from hence, and step forth from out the lines 
<A NAME="644"></A>of the armies."
<A NAME="645"></A><BR><BR>For there was a zone between the two camps that none might pass. 
<A NAME="646"></A>And Sohrab assented to the demand of Rustem, and they stepped out into 
<A NAME="647"></A>it, and made them ready for single combat. But when Sohrab would have fallen 
<A NAME="648"></A>upon him, the soul of Rustem melted with compassion, and he desired to 
<A NAME="649"></A>save a boy thus fair and valiant. So he said unto him-
<A NAME="650"></A><BR><BR>"O young man, the air is warm and soft, but the earth is cold. 
<A NAME="651"></A>I have pity upon thee, and would not take from thee the boon of life. Yet 
<A NAME="652"></A>if we combat together, surely thou wilt fall by my hands, for none have 
<A NAME="653"></A>withstood my power, neither men nor Deevs nor dragons. Desist, therefore, 
<A NAME="654"></A>from this enterprise, and quit the ranks of Turan, for Iran hath need of 
<A NAME="655"></A>heroes like unto thee."
<A NAME="656"></A><BR><BR>Now while Rustem spake thus, the heart of Sohrab went out to him. 
<A NAME="657"></A>And he looked at him wistfully, and said-
<A NAME="658"></A><BR><BR>"O hero, I am about to put unto thee a question, and I entreat 
<A NAME="659"></A>of thee that thou reply to me according to the truth. Tell unto me thy 
<A NAME="660"></A>name, that my heart may rejoice in thy words, for it seemeth unto me that 
<A NAME="661"></A>thou art none other than Rustem, the son of Zal, the son of Saum, the son 
<A NAME="662"></A>of Neriman."
<A NAME="663"></A><BR><BR>But Rustem replied, "Thou errest, I am not Rustem, neither am I 
<A NAME="664"></A>sprung from the race of Neriman. Rustem is a Pehliva, but I, I am a slave, 
<A NAME="665"></A>and own neither a crown nor a throne."
<A NAME="666"></A><BR><BR>These words spake Rustem that Sohrab might be afraid when he beheld 
<A NAME="667"></A>his prowess, and deem that yet greater might was hidden in the camp of 
<A NAME="668"></A>his enemy. But Sohrab when he heard these words was sad, and his hopes 
<A NAME="669"></A>that were risen so high were shattered, and the day that had looked so 
<A NAME="670"></A>bright was made dark unto his eyes. Then he made him ready for the combat, 
<A NAME="671"></A>and they fought until their spears were shivered and their swords hacked 
<A NAME="672"></A>like unto saws. And when all their weapons were bent, they betook them 
<A NAME="673"></A>unto clubs, and they waged war with these until they were broken. Then 
<A NAME="674"></A>they strove until their mail was torn and their horses spent with exhaustion, 
<A NAME="675"></A>and even then they could not desist, but wrestled with one another with 
<A NAME="676"></A>their hands till that the sweat and blood ran down from their bodies. And 
<A NAME="677"></A>they contended until their throats were parched and their bodies weary, 
<A NAME="678"></A>and to neither was given the victory. Then they stayed them a while to 
<A NAME="679"></A>rest, and Rustem thought within his mind how all his days he had not coped 
<A NAME="680"></A>with such a hero. And it seemed to him that his contest with the White 
<A NAME="681"></A>Deev had been as nought to this.
<A NAME="682"></A><BR><BR>Now when they had rested a while they fell to again, and they fought 
<A NAME="683"></A>with arrows, but still none could surpass the other. Then Rustem strove 
<A NAME="684"></A>to hurl Sohrab from his steed, but it availed him nought, and he could 
<A NAME="685"></A>shake him no more than the mountain can be moved from its seat. So they 
<A NAME="686"></A>betook themselves again unto clubs, and Sohrab aimed at Rustem with might 
<A NAME="687"></A>and smote him, and Rustem reeled beneath the stroke, and bit his lips in 
<A NAME="688"></A>agony. Then Sohrab vaunted his advantage, and-bade Rustem go and measure 
<A NAME="689"></A>him with his equals; for though his strength be great, he could not stand 
<A NAME="690"></A>against a youth. So they went their ways, and Rustem fell upon the men 
<A NAME="691"></A>of Turan, and spread confusion far and wide among their ranks; and Sohrab 
<A NAME="692"></A>raged along the lines of Iran, and men and horses fell under his hands. 
<A NAME="693"></A>And Rustem was sad in his soul, and he turned with sorrow into his camp. 
<A NAME="694"></A>But when he saw the destruction Sohrab had wrought his anger was kindled, 
<A NAME="695"></A>and he reproached the youth, and challenged him to come forth yet again 
<A NAME="696"></A>to single combat. But because that the day was far spent they resolved 
<A NAME="697"></A>to rest until the morrow.
<A NAME="698"></A><BR><BR>Then Rustem went before Kai Kaous and told him of this boy of valour, 
<A NAME="699"></A>and he prayed unto Ormuzd that He would give him strength to vanquish his 
<A NAME="700"></A>foe. Yet he made ready also his house lest he should fall in the fight, 
<A NAME="701"></A>and he commanded that a tender message be borne unto Rudabeh, and he sent 
<A NAME="702"></A>words of comfort unto Zal, his father. And Sohrab, too, in his camp lauded 
<A NAME="703"></A>the might of Rustem, and he said how the battle had been sore, and how 
<A NAME="704"></A>his mind had misgiven him of the issue. And he spake unto Human, 
<A NAME="705"></A>saying-
<A NAME="706"></A><BR><BR>"My mind is filled with thoughts of this aged man, mine adversary, 
<A NAME="707"></A>for it would seem unto me that his stature is like unto mine, and that 
<A NAME="708"></A>I behold about him the tokens that my mother recounted unto me. And my 
<A NAME="709"></A>heart goeth out towards him, and I muse if it be Rustem, my father. For 
<A NAME="710"></A>it behoveth me not to combat him. Wherefore, I beseech thee, tell unto 
<A NAME="711"></A>me how this may be."
<A NAME="712"></A><BR><BR>But Human answered and said, "Oft have I looked upon the face of 
<A NAME="713"></A>Rustem in battle, and mine eyes have beheld his deeds of valour; but this 
<A NAME="714"></A>man in no wise resembleth him, nor is his manner of wielding his club the 
<A NAME="715"></A>same."
<A NAME="716"></A><BR><BR>These things spake Human in his vileness, because that Afrasiyab 
<A NAME="717"></A>had enjoined him to lead Sohrab into destruction. And Sohrab held his peace, 
<A NAME="718"></A>but he was not wholly satisfied.
<A NAME="719"></A><BR><BR>Now when the day had begun to lighten the sky and clear away the 
<A NAME="720"></A>shadows, Rustem and Sohrab strode forth unto the midway spot that stretched 
<A NAME="721"></A>between the armies. And Sohrab bare in his hands a mighty club, and the 
<A NAME="722"></A>garb of battle was upon him; but his mouth was full of smiles, and he asked 
<A NAME="723"></A>of Rustem how he had rested, and he said-
<A NAME="724"></A><BR><BR>"Wherefore hast thou prepared thy heart for battle? Cast from thee, 
<A NAME="725"></A>I beg, this mace and sword of vengeance, and let us doff our armour, and 
<A NAME="726"></A>seat ourselves together in amity, and let wine soften our angry deeds. 
<A NAME="727"></A>For it seemeth unto me that this conflict is impure. And if thou wilt listen 
<A NAME="728"></A>to my desires, my heart shall speak to thee of love, and I will make the 
<A NAME="729"></A>tears of shame spring up into thine eyes. And for this cause I ask thee 
<A NAME="730"></A>yet again, tell me thy name, neither hide it any longer, for I behold that 
<A NAME="731"></A>thou art of noble race. And it would seem unto me that thou art Rustem, 
<A NAME="732"></A>the chosen one, the Lord of Zaboulistan, the son of Zal, the son of Saum 
<A NAME="733"></A>the hero."
<A NAME="734"></A><BR><BR>But Rustem answered, "O hero of tender age, we are not come forth 
<A NAME="735"></A>to parley but to combat, and mine ears are sealed against thy words of 
<A NAME="736"></A>lure. I am an old man, and thou art young, but we are girded for battle, 
<A NAME="737"></A>and the Master of the world shall decide between us."
<A NAME="738"></A><BR><BR>Then Sohrab said, "O man of many years, wherefore wilt thou not 
<A NAME="739"></A>listen to the counsel of a stripling? I desired that thy soul should leave 
<A NAME="740"></A>thee upon thy bed, but thou hast elected to perish in the combat. That 
<A NAME="741"></A>which is ordained it must be done, therefore let us make ready for the 
<A NAME="742"></A>conflict."
<A NAME="743"></A><BR><BR>So they made them ready, and when they had bound their steeds they 
<A NAME="744"></A>fell upon each other, and the crash of their encounter was heard like thunder 
<A NAME="745"></A>throughout the camps. And they measured their strength from the morning 
<A NAME="746"></A>until the setting of the sun. And when the day was about to vanish, Sohrab 
<A NAME="747"></A>seized upon Rustem by the girdle and threw him upon the ground, and kneeled 
<A NAME="748"></A>upon him, and drew forth his sword from his scabbard, and would have severed 
<A NAME="749"></A>his head from his trunk. Then Rustem knew that only wile could save him. 
<A NAME="750"></A>So he opened his mouth and said-
<A NAME="751"></A><BR><BR>"O young man, thou knowest not the customs of the combat. It is 
<A NAME="752"></A>written in the laws of honour that he who overthroweth a brave man for 
<A NAME="753"></A>the first time should not destroy him, but preserve him for fight a second 
<A NAME="754"></A>time, then only is it given unto him to kill his adversary."
<A NAME="755"></A><BR><BR>And Sohrab listened to Rustem's words of craft and stayed his hand, 
<A NAME="756"></A>and he let the warrior go, and because that the day was ended he sought 
<A NAME="757"></A>to fight no more, but turned him aside and chased the deer until the night 
<A NAME="758"></A>was spent. Then came to him Human, and asked of the adventures of the day. 
<A NAME="759"></A>And Sohrab told him how he had vanquished the tall man, and how he had 
<A NAME="760"></A>granted him freedom. And Human reproached him with his folly, and 
<A NAME="761"></A>said-
<A NAME="762"></A><BR><BR>"Alas, young man, thou didst fall into a snare, for this is not 
<A NAME="763"></A>the custom among the brave. And now perchance thou wilt yet fall under 
<A NAME="764"></A>the hands of this warrior."
<A NAME="765"></A><BR><BR>Sohrab was abashed when he heard the words of Human, but he 
<A NAME="766"></A>said-
<A NAME="767"></A><BR>"Be not grieved, for in an hour we meet again in battle, and verily 
<A NAME="768"></A>he will not stand a third time against my youthful strength."
<A NAME="769"></A><BR><BR>Now while Sohrab was thus doing, Rustem was gone beside a running 
<A NAME="770"></A>brook, and laved his limbs, and prayed to God in his distress. And he entreated 
<A NAME="771"></A>of Ormuzd that He would grant him such strength that the victory must be 
<A NAME="772"></A>his. And Ormuzd heard him, and gave to him such strength that the rock 
<A NAME="773"></A>whereon Rustem stood gave way under his feet, because it had not the power 
<A NAME="774"></A>to bear him. Then Rustem saw it was too much, and he prayed yet again that 
<A NAME="775"></A>part thereof be taken from him. And once more Ormuzd listened to his voice. 
<A NAME="776"></A>Then when the time for combat was come, Rustem turned him to the meeting-place, 
<A NAME="777"></A>and his heart was full of cares and his face of fears. But Sohrab came 
<A NAME="778"></A>forth like a giant refreshed, and he ran at Rustem like to a mad elephant, 
<A NAME="779"></A>and he cried with a voice of thunder-
<A NAME="780"></A><BR><BR>"O thou who didst flee from battle, wherefore art thou come out 
<A NAME="781"></A>once more against me? But I say unto thee, this time shall thy words of 
<A NAME="782"></A>guile avail thee nought."
<A NAME="783"></A><BR><BR>And Rustem, when he heard him, and looked upon him, was seized 
<A NAME="784"></A>with misgiving, and he learned to know fear. So he prayed to Ormuzd that 
<A NAME="785"></A>He would restore to him the power He had taken back. But he suffered not 
<A NAME="786"></A>Sohrab to behold his fears, and they made them ready for the fight. And 
<A NAME="787"></A>he closed upon Sohrab with all his new-found might, and shook him terribly, 
<A NAME="788"></A>and though Sohrab returned his attacks with vigour, the hour of his overthrow 
<A NAME="789"></A>was come. For Rustem took him by the girdle and hurled him unto the earth, 
<A NAME="790"></A>and he broke his back like to a reed, and he drew forth his sword to sever 
<A NAME="791"></A>his body. Then Sohrab knew it was the end, and he gave a great sigh, and 
<A NAME="792"></A>writhed in his agony, and he said-
<A NAME="793"></A><BR><BR>"That which is come about, it is my fault, and henceforward will 
<A NAME="794"></A>my youth be a theme of derision among the people. But I sped not forth 
<A NAME="795"></A>for empty glory, but I went out to seek my father; for my mother had told 
<A NAME="796"></A>me by what tokens I should know him, and I perish for longing after him. 
<A NAME="797"></A>And now have my pains been fruitless, for it hath not been given unto me 
<A NAME="798"></A>to look upon his face. Yet I say unto thee, if thou shouldest become a 
<A NAME="799"></A>fish that swimmeth in the depths of the ocean, if thou shouldest change 
<A NAME="800"></A>into a star that is concealed in the farthest heaven, my father would draw 
<A NAME="801"></A>thee forth from thy hiding-place, and avenge my death upon thee when he 
<A NAME="802"></A>shall learn that the earth is become my bed. For my father is Rustem the 
<A NAME="803"></A>Pehliva, and it shall be told unto him how that Sohrab his son perished 
<A NAME="804"></A>in the quest after his face."
<A NAME="805"></A><BR><BR>When Rustem heard these words his sword fell from out of his grasp, 
<A NAME="806"></A>and he was shaken with dismay. And there broke from his heart a groan as 
<A NAME="807"></A>of one whose heart was racked with anguish. And the earth became dark before 
<A NAME="808"></A>his eyes, and he sank down lifeless beside his son. But when he had opened 
<A NAME="809"></A>his eyes once more, he cried unto Sohrab in the agony of his spirit. And 
<A NAME="810"></A>he said-
<A NAME="811"></A><BR><BR>"Bearest thou about thee a token of Rustem, that I may know that 
<A NAME="812"></A>the words which thou speakest are true? For I am Rustem the unhappy, and 
<A NAME="813"></A>may my name be struck from the lists of men!"
<A NAME="814"></A><BR><BR>When Sohrab heard these words his misery was boundless, and he 
<A NAME="815"></A>cried-
<A NAME="816"></A><BR><BR>"If thou art indeed my father, then hast thou stained thy sword 
<A NAME="817"></A>in the life-blood of thy son. And thou didst it of thine obstinacy. For 
<A NAME="818"></A>I sought to turn thee unto love, and I implored of thee thy name, for I 
<A NAME="819"></A>thought to behold in thee the tokens recounted of my mother. But I appealed 
<A NAME="820"></A>unto thy heart in vain, and now is the time gone by for meeting. Yet open, 
<A NAME="821"></A>I beseech thee, mine armour, and regard the jewel upon mine arm. For it 
<A NAME="822"></A>is an onyx given unto me by my father, as a token whereby he should know 
<A NAME="823"></A>me."
<A NAME="824"></A><BR><BR>Then Rustem did as Sohrab bade him, and he opened his mail and 
<A NAME="825"></A>saw the onyx; and when he had seen it he tore his clothes in his distress, 
<A NAME="826"></A>and he covered his head with ashes. And the tears of penitence ran from 
<A NAME="827"></A>his eyes, and he roared aloud in his sorrow. But Sohrab 
<A NAME="828"></A>said-
<A NAME="829"></A><BR><BR>"It is in vain, there is no remedy. Weep not, therefore, for doubtless 
<A NAME="830"></A>it was written that this should be."
<A NAME="831"></A><BR><BR>Now when the sun was set, and Rustem returned not to the camp, 
<A NAME="832"></A>the nobles of Iran were afraid, and they went forth to seek him. And when 
<A NAME="833"></A>they were gone but a little way they came upon Rakush, and when they saw 
<A NAME="834"></A>that he was alone they raised a wailing, for they deemed that of a surety 
<A NAME="835"></A>Rustem was perished. And they went and told Kai Kaous thereof, and he 
<A NAME="836"></A>said-
<A NAME="837"></A><BR><BR>"Let Tus go forth and see if this indeed be so, and if Rustem be 
<A NAME="838"></A>truly fallen, let the drums call men unto battle that we may avenge him 
<A NAME="839"></A>upon this Turk."
<A NAME="840"></A><BR><BR>Now Sohrab, when he beheld afar off the men that were come out 
<A NAME="841"></A>to seek Rustem, turned to his father and said-
<A NAME="842"></A><BR><BR>"I entreat of thee that thou do unto me an act of love. Let not 
<A NAME="843"></A>the Shah fall upon the men of Turan, for they came not forth in enmity 
<A NAME="844"></A>to him but to do my desire, and on my head alone resteth this expedition. 
<A NAME="845"></A>Wherefore I desire not that they should perish when I can defend them no 
<A NAME="846"></A>longer. As for me, I came like the thunder and I vanish like the wind, 
<A NAME="847"></A>but perchance it is given unto us to meet again above."
<A NAME="848"></A><BR><BR>Then Rustem promised to do the desires of Sohrab. And he went before 
<A NAME="849"></A>the men of Iran, and when they beheld him yet alive they set up a great 
<A NAME="850"></A>shout, but when they saw that his clothes were torn, and that he bare about 
<A NAME="851"></A>him the marks of sorrow, they asked of him what was come to pass. Then 
<A NAME="852"></A>he told them how he had caused a noble son to perish. And they were grieved 
<A NAME="853"></A>for him, and joined in his wailing. Then he bade one among them go forth 
<A NAME="854"></A>into the camp of Turan, and deliver this message unto Human. And he sent 
<A NAME="855"></A>word unto him, saying-
<A NAME="856"></A><BR><BR>"The sword of vengeance must slumber in the scabbard. Thou art 
<A NAME="857"></A>now leader of the host, return, therefore, whence thou camest, and depart 
<A NAME="858"></A>across the river ere many days be fallen. As for me, I will fight no more, 
<A NAME="859"></A>yet neither will I speak unto thee again, for thou didst hide from my son 
<A NAME="860"></A>the tokens of his father, of thine iniquity thou didst lead him into this 
<A NAME="861"></A>pit."
<A NAME="862"></A><BR><BR>Then when he had thus spoken, Rustem turned him yet again unto 
<A NAME="863"></A>his son. And the nobles went with him, and they beheld Sohrab, and heard 
<A NAME="864"></A>his groans of pain. And Rustem, when he saw the agony of the boy, was beside 
<A NAME="865"></A>himself, and would have made an end of his own life, but the nobles suffered 
<A NAME="866"></A>it not, and stayed his hand. Then Rustem remembered him that Kai Kaous 
<A NAME="867"></A>had a balm mighty to heal. And he prayed Gudarz go before the Shah, and 
<A NAME="868"></A>bear unto him a message of entreaty from Rustem his servant. And he 
<A NAME="869"></A>said-
<A NAME="870"></A><BR><BR>"O Shah, if ever I have done that which was good in thy sight, 
<A NAME="871"></A>if ever my hand have been of avail unto thee, recall now my benefits in 
<A NAME="872"></A>the hour of my need, and have pity upon my dire distress. Send unto me, 
<A NAME="873"></A>I pray thee, of the balm that is among thy treasures, that my son may be 
<A NAME="874"></A>healed by thy grace."
<A NAME="875"></A><BR><BR>And Gudarz outstripped the whirlwind in his speed to bear unto 
<A NAME="876"></A>the Shah this message. But the heart of Kai Kaous was hardened, and he 
<A NAME="877"></A>remembered not the benefits he had received from Rustem, and he recalled 
<A NAME="878"></A>only the proud words that he had spoken before him. And he was afraid lest 
<A NAME="879"></A>the might of Sohrab be joined to that of his father, and that together 
<A NAME="880"></A>they prove mightier than he, and turn upon him. So he shut his ear unto 
<A NAME="881"></A>the cry of his Pehliva. And Gudarz bore back the answer of the Shah, and 
<A NAME="882"></A>he said-
<A NAME="883"></A><BR><BR>"The heart of Kai Kaous is flinty, and his evil nature is like 
<A NAME="884"></A>to a bitter gourd that ceaseth never to bear fruit. Yet I counsel thee, 
<A NAME="885"></A>go before him thyself, and see if peradventure thou soften this 
<A NAME="886"></A>rock."
<A NAME="887"></A><BR><BR>And Rustem in his grief did as Gudarz counselled, and turned to 
<A NAME="888"></A>go before the Shah, but he was not come before him ere a messenger overtook 
<A NAME="889"></A>him, and told unto him that Sohrab was departed from the world. Then Rustem 
<A NAME="890"></A>set up a wailing such as the earth hath not heard the like of, and he heaped 
<A NAME="891"></A>reproaches upon himself, and he could not cease from plaining the son that 
<A NAME="892"></A>was fallen by his hands. And he cried continually-
<A NAME="893"></A><BR><BR>"I that am old have killed my son. I that am strong have uprooted 
<A NAME="894"></A>this mighty boy. I have torn the heart of my child, I have laid low the 
<A NAME="895"></A>head of a Pehliva."
<A NAME="896"></A><BR><BR>Then he made a great fire, and flung into it his tent of many colours, 
<A NAME="897"></A>and his trappings of Roum, his saddle, and his leopard-skin, his armour 
<A NAME="898"></A>well tried in battle, and all the appurtenances of his throne. And he stood 
<A NAME="899"></A>by and looked on to see his pride laid in the dust. And he tore his flesh, 
<A NAME="900"></A>and cried aloud-
<A NAME="901"></A><BR><BR>"My heart is sick unto death."
<A NAME="902"></A><BR>Then he commanded that Sohrab be swathed in rich brocades of gold worthy 
<A NAME="903"></A>of his body. And when they had enfolded him, and Rustem learned that the 
<A NAME="904"></A>Turanians had quitted the borders, he made ready his army to return unto 
<A NAME="905"></A>Zaboulistan. And the nobles marched before the bier, and their heads were 
<A NAME="906"></A>covered with ashes, and their garments were torn. And the drums of the 
<A NAME="907"></A>war-elephants were shattered, and the cymbals broken, and the tails of 
<A NAME="908"></A>the horses were shorn to the root, and all the signs of mourning were 
<A NAME="909"></A>abroad.
<A NAME="910"></A><BR><BR>Now Zal, when he saw the host returning thus in sorrow, marvelled 
<A NAME="911"></A>what was come about; for he beheld Rustem at their head, wherefore he knew 
<A NAME="912"></A>that the wailing was not for his son. And he came before Rustem and questioned 
<A NAME="913"></A>him. And Rustem led him unto the bier and showed unto him the youth that 
<A NAME="914"></A>was like in feature and in might unto Saum the son of Neriman, and he told 
<A NAME="915"></A>him all that was come to pass, and how this was his son, who in years was 
<A NAME="916"></A>but an infant, but a hero in battle. And Rudabeh too came out to behold 
<A NAME="917"></A>the child, and she joined her lamentations unto theirs. Then they built 
<A NAME="918"></A>for Sohrab a tomb like to a horse's hoof, and Rustem laid him therein in 
<A NAME="919"></A>a chamber of gold perfumed with ambergris. And he covered him with brocades 
<A NAME="920"></A>of gold. And when it was done, the house of Rustem grew like to a grave, 
<A NAME="921"></A>and its courts were filled with the voice of sorrow. And no joy would enter 
<A NAME="922"></A>into the heart of Rustem, and it was long before he held high his 
<A NAME="923"></A>head.
<A NAME="924"></A><BR><BR>Meantime the news spread even unto Turan, and there too did all 
<A NAME="925"></A>men grieve and weep for the child of prowess that was fallen in his bloom. 
<A NAME="926"></A>And the King of Samengan tore his vestments, but when his daughter learned 
<A NAME="927"></A>it she was beside herself with affliction. And Tahmineh cried after her 
<A NAME="928"></A>son, and bewailed the evil fate that had befallen him, and she heaped black 
<A NAME="929"></A>earth upon her head, and tore her hair, and wrung her hands, and rolled 
<A NAME="930"></A>on the ground in her agony. And her mouth was never weary of plaining. 
<A NAME="931"></A>Then she caused the garments of Sohrab to be brought unto her, and his 
<A NAME="932"></A>throne and his steed. And she regarded them, and stroked the courser and 
<A NAME="933"></A>poured tears upon his hoofs, and she cherished the robes as though they 
<A NAME="934"></A>yet contained her boy, and she pressed the head of the palfrey unto her 
<A NAME="935"></A>breast, and she kissed the helmet that Sohrab had worn. Then with his sword 
<A NAME="936"></A>she cut off the tail of his steed and set fire unto the house of Sohrab, 
<A NAME="937"></A>and she gave his gold and jewels unto the poor. And when a year had thus 
<A NAME="938"></A>rolled over her bitterness, the breath departed from out her body, and 
<A NAME="939"></A>her spirit went forth after Sohrab her son.
