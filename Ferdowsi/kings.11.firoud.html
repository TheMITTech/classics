<A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A>But a little while had Kai Khosrau sat upon the throne of Iran, yet the 
<A NAME="11"></A>world resounded with his fame, and all men bare upon their lips the praises 
<A NAME="12"></A>of his wisdom. He cleansed the earth of the rust of care, and the power 
<A NAME="13"></A>of Afrasiyab was chained up. And men from all parts of the earth came forth 
<A NAME="14"></A>to do homage before him; and Rustem also, and Zal the aged, did obeisance 
<A NAME="15"></A>at his footstool. And there came with them an army that made the plains 
<A NAME="16"></A>black like to ebony, and the sounds of their war trumpets made the heart 
<A NAME="17"></A>to tremble. Then Kai Kaous made ready a great feast to do honour to his 
<A NAME="18"></A>Pehliva. And when they were seated thereat his mouth ran over with praises 
<A NAME="19"></A>of Saiawush, and he lamented the evil that he had done, and he poured maledictions 
<A NAME="20"></A>upon the head of Afrasiyab. And he spake unto Kai Khosrau his son, and 
<A NAME="21"></A>said-
<A NAME="22"></A><BR><BR>"I demand of thee that thou swear before me a great oath, and that 
<A NAME="23"></A>thou keep it carefully. Swear unto me that thy heart shall be ever filled 
<A NAME="24"></A>with hatred of Afrasiyab, and that thou wilt not let this flame be quenched 
<A NAME="25"></A>by the waters of forgetfulness, and that thou regard him not as the father 
<A NAME="26"></A>of thy mother, and that thou think only of Saiawush thy sire, whom he hath 
<A NAME="27"></A>slain. And swear unto me further that there shall be no other mediator 
<A NAME="28"></A>between you save only the sword and the mace."
<A NAME="29"></A><BR><BR>Then Kai Khosrau turned him towards the fire and sware the oath 
<A NAME="30"></A>demanded of his sire, and he vowed to keep it in the name of God the Most 
<A NAME="31"></A>High. And Kai Kaous caused the oath to be written on a royal scroll, and 
<A NAME="32"></A>he confided it to the care of Rustem his Pehliva. And when it was done 
<A NAME="33"></A>they feasted seven days without ceasing, but on the eighth Kai Khosrau 
<A NAME="34"></A>mounted his throne. Then he called about him his nobles, and he said unto 
<A NAME="35"></A>them that the time was ripe to avenge the death of his father, and he bade 
<A NAME="36"></A>them make ready their armies, and he told them how on a certain day they 
<A NAME="37"></A>should lead them out before him.
<A NAME="38"></A><BR><BR>Now when the day was come Kai Khosrau descended into the plains 
<A NAME="39"></A>to receive them. And he was seated upon an elephant of war, and on his 
<A NAME="40"></A>head he wore the crown of might, and about his neck the chain of supremacy; 
<A NAME="41"></A>and in his hand he bare a mace of might, and on his arms were bracelets 
<A NAME="42"></A>of great worth, and precious stones were strewn about his garments. Now 
<A NAME="43"></A>when he was come into the midst of the camp he threw a ball of silver into 
<A NAME="44"></A>a cup of gold. And when the army heard the sound thereof they knew it to 
<A NAME="45"></A>be the signal, and they arose and passed before the Shah. And the first 
<A NAME="46"></A>to come forth was the army of Friburz. And Friburz was seated upon a horse 
<A NAME="47"></A>of saffron hue, and he wore shoes of gold upon his feet, and in his hands 
<A NAME="48"></A>were a sword and a mace; and around his saddle was rolled a cord of might, 
<A NAME="49"></A>and over his head floated a banner the colour of the sun. And Kai Khosrau, 
<A NAME="50"></A>when he saw him, invoked blessings upon his head. And there came after 
<A NAME="51"></A>Friburz Gudarz the wise in counsel, and behind him was borne a standard 
<A NAME="52"></A>whereon was broidered a lion. And at his right hand and his left marched 
<A NAME="53"></A>his mighty sons, and a brave army followed after them. And they did homage 
<A NAME="54"></A>before the Shah, and Kai Khosrau regarded them kindly. Then there came 
<A NAME="55"></A>after them yet many other noble knights, eager for battle as a bull whom 
<A NAME="56"></A>no man hath put to flight, and the sounds of cymbals and the bells of war-elephants 
<A NAME="57"></A>filled the air, and lances and targets gleamed in the sun, and banners 
<A NAME="58"></A>of many hues streamed upon the breeze. And Kai Khosrau blessed his heroes 
<A NAME="59"></A>every one. Then he caused his treasurer to bring forth rich gifts of gold 
<A NAME="60"></A>and jewels and slaves, and brocades of Roum, and cloth of gold, and skins 
<A NAME="61"></A>of beaver. And they placed them before him, and he divided them into portions, 
<A NAME="62"></A>and he said they should be owned of those who should do feats of valour 
<A NAME="63"></A>in the war against Afrasiyab. Then he bade them to a great feast, and they 
<A NAME="64"></A>made merry in the house of the Shah.
<A NAME="65"></A><BR><BR>But when the sun had unsheathed its sword of light and the sombre 
<A NAME="66"></A>night was fled in fear, Kai Khosrau commanded that the trumpets of departure 
<A NAME="67"></A>sound. Then the army came before the Shah, and he gave into the keeping 
<A NAME="68"></A>of Tus the standard of Kawah, and he bade him lead forth the hosts. And 
<A NAME="69"></A>he said unto Tus-
<A NAME="70"></A><BR><BR>"Be obedient unto my will and lead mine army aright. I desire of 
<A NAME="71"></A>thee that thou avenge the death of my father, but I desire also that thou 
<A NAME="72"></A>molest none but those that fight. Have mercy upon the labourer and spare 
<A NAME="73"></A>the helpless. And furthermore, I charge thee that thou pass not through 
<A NAME="74"></A>the land of Kelat, but that thou leave it on one side and take thy course 
<A NAME="75"></A>through the desert. For in Kelat abideth Firoud my brother, who was born 
<A NAME="76"></A>of the daughter of Piran, and he dwelleth in happiness, and I would not 
<A NAME="77"></A>that sorrow come nigh unto him. And he knoweth no man in Iran, not even 
<A NAME="78"></A>by name, and unto no man hath he done hurt, and I desire that no harm come 
<A NAME="79"></A>to him."
<A NAME="80"></A><BR><BR>And Tus said, "I will remember thy will and take the road that 
<A NAME="81"></A>thou commandest."
<A NAME="82"></A><BR><BR>Then the army set forth towards Turan, and they marched many days 
<A NAME="83"></A>until they came to a spot where the roads parted. And the one led unto 
<A NAME="84"></A>the desert, arid and devoid of water, and the other led unto Kelat. Now 
<A NAME="85"></A>when they were come to the parting of the roads the army halted until Tus 
<A NAME="86"></A>should have told unto them which road they should follow. And when Tus 
<A NAME="87"></A>came up he said unto Gudarz-
<A NAME="88"></A><BR><BR>"The desert is void of water, and what shall we do deprived thereof, 
<A NAME="89"></A>for the army sore needeth refreshment after its march of weariness? It 
<A NAME="90"></A>is better, therefore, that we should take the road that leadeth to Kelat, 
<A NAME="91"></A>and abide there a while that our men may be rested."
<A NAME="92"></A><BR><BR>And Gudarz said, "The King hath set thee at the head of his army, 
<A NAME="93"></A>but I counsel thee choose the path that he hath named, lest sorrow come 
<A NAME="94"></A>upon thee."
<A NAME="95"></A><BR><BR>But Tus laughed, and said, "O noble hero, disquiet not thyself, 
<A NAME="96"></A>for what I do is pleasing in. the sight of the King."
<A NAME="97"></A><BR><BR>Then he commanded the army that they march into Kelat, and he remembered 
<A NAME="98"></A>not the desires of Kai Khosrau.
<A NAME="99"></A><BR><BR>Now when Firoud saw that the sky was darkened with dust from the 
<A NAME="100"></A>feet of dromedaries and elephants of battle, he called before him Tokhareh 
<A NAME="101"></A>his counsellor, and questioned him concerning these things. And Tokhareh 
<A NAME="102"></A>said-
<A NAME="103"></A><BR><BR>"O young man, thou knowest not what is come to pass. This army 
<A NAME="104"></A>pertaineth unto thy brother, and he hath sent it forth into Turan that 
<A NAME="105"></A>the death of thy father be avenged; and it marcheth right upon Kelat, and 
<A NAME="106"></A>I know not where the battle may take place."
<A NAME="107"></A><BR><BR>Now Firoud, who was void of experience, was troubled when he learned 
<A NAME="108"></A>this; and he made safe his castle that was upon a high hill, and he gathered 
<A NAME="109"></A>in his flocks. Then he seated himself upon the ramparts and looked down 
<A NAME="110"></A>over the sea of armour that approached him. And when he had done so he 
<A NAME="111"></A>went in before his mother, who had never ceased from weeping for Saiawush 
<A NAME="112"></A>her spouse. And he told her what was come about, and he asked of her how 
<A NAME="113"></A>he should act. Then she said unto him-
<A NAME="114"></A><BR><BR>"Listen, O my son I There is a new Shah in Iran, and he is brother 
<A NAME="115"></A>unto thee, for ye are sprung from one father. Now, since thy brother sendeth 
<A NAME="116"></A>forth an host to avenge his murder, it beseemeth thee not to remain aloof, 
<A NAME="117"></A>but rather shouldst thou serve as vanguard unto the host. Wherefore call 
<A NAME="118"></A>together thy knights, and then go forth and seek out the leader of this 
<A NAME="119"></A>host, and make thyself known to him. For it behoveth not a stranger to 
<A NAME="120"></A>reap this glory or usurp the place that is due unto thy 
<A NAME="121"></A>rank."
<A NAME="122"></A><BR><BR>Then Firoud said, "Who shall be my stay in battle among the heroes 
<A NAME="123"></A>who carry high their heads?"
<A NAME="124"></A><BR><BR>And his mother said, "Seek out Bahram, for he was a friend unto 
<A NAME="125"></A>thy father. And listen also to the words of Tokhareh, and go not out at 
<A NAME="126"></A>once with thine army until thou hast made thyself known unto the men of 
<A NAME="127"></A>Iran."
<A NAME="128"></A><BR><BR>Then Firoud said, "O my mother, I will faithfully observe thy 
<A NAME="129"></A>counsel."
<A NAME="130"></A><BR><BR>And he went forth unto a high place on the mountain, and he took 
<A NAME="131"></A>with him Tokhareh, and they looked down upon the mighty army that was spread 
<A NAME="132"></A>at their feet. Then Firoud questioned of the warriors, and Tokhareh answered 
<A NAME="133"></A>him according to his knowledge. And he counted up the standards of the 
<A NAME="134"></A>heroes, and he made Firoud acquainted with the names of might in 
<A NAME="135"></A>Iran.
<A NAME="136"></A><BR><BR>Now, while they were so doing, Tus beheld them upon the heights, 
<A NAME="137"></A>and he was angered at the sight of them, and said-
<A NAME="138"></A><BR><BR>"Let a wary knight go forth unto those two seated aloft, and search 
<A NAME="139"></A>out what manner of men they be. And if they be of the army, let them be 
<A NAME="140"></A>lashed two hundred times about the head; but if they be Turks and spies, 
<A NAME="141"></A>bind them, and bring them before me that I may destroy 
<A NAME="142"></A>them."
<A NAME="143"></A><BR><BR>Then Bahram, the son of Gudarz, said, "I will search into this 
<A NAME="144"></A>matter."
<A NAME="145"></A><BR><BR>And he rode forth towards the mountain. Now Firoud, beholding him, 
<A NAME="146"></A>said unto Tokhareh, "Who is he that cometh out with so haughty an air? 
<A NAME="147"></A>By his bearing it would seem that he holdeth me of light esteem, and that 
<A NAME="148"></A>he would mount hither by force."
<A NAME="149"></A><BR><BR>Then Tokhareh said, "O Prince, be not angered thus easily. I know 
<A NAME="150"></A>not his name, but I seem to behold the device of Gudarz, and perchance 
<A NAME="151"></A>this is one of his sons."
<A NAME="152"></A><BR><BR>Now Bahram, when he had neared the summit, lifted up his voice, 
<A NAME="153"></A>that was like unto thunder, and cried, saying-
<A NAME="154"></A><BR><BR>"Who art thou that seatest thyself upon the heights and lookest 
<A NAME="155"></A>down upon the army? Fearest thou not Tus the Pehliva? 
<A NAME="156"></A>"
<A NAME="157"></A><BR><BR>Then Firoud answered and said-
<A NAME="158"></A><BR>"Speak not unto me thus haughtily, for I have given thee no cause. 
<A NAME="159"></A>Thinkest thou, perchance, that I am but a wild ass of the desert, and that 
<A NAME="160"></A>thou art a lion, great of might? It behoveth a man of sense to put a bridle 
<A NAME="161"></A>on his tongue. For I say unto thee, that thou art in nowise my better, 
<A NAME="162"></A>neither in courage nor in might. Look upon me, and judge whether I have 
<A NAME="163"></A>not head and heart and brain, and when thou shalt have seen that I possess 
<A NAME="164"></A>them, threaten me not with empty words. I counsel this unto thee in friendship. 
<A NAME="165"></A>And if thou wilt listen to reason, I will put some questions unto 
<A NAME="166"></A>thee."
<A NAME="167"></A><BR><BR>Then Bahram replied, "Speak; thou art in the sky, and I am on the 
<A NAME="168"></A>ground."
<A NAME="169"></A><BR><BR>Then Firoud asked of him who were the chiefs of this army, and 
<A NAME="170"></A>wherefore they were come forth. And Bahram named unto him the names of 
<A NAME="171"></A>might. Then Firoud said unto him-
<A NAME="172"></A><BR><BR>"Why hast thou not spoken the name of Bahram? There is none among 
<A NAME="173"></A>all the host of Iran that mine eyes would rather look 
<A NAME="174"></A>upon."
<A NAME="175"></A><BR><BR>Then Bahram said, "O youth, say unto me who hath spoken unto thee 
<A NAME="176"></A>thus of Bahram, and who hath made thee acquainted with Gudarz and 
<A NAME="177"></A>Gew."
<A NAME="178"></A><BR><BR>Then Firoud said, "My mother hath made them known unto me, and 
<A NAME="179"></A>she bade me seek out Bahram from among this host, because that he was foster-brother 
<A NAME="180"></A>unto my father."
<A NAME="181"></A><BR><BR>Then Bahram spake, and said, "Verily thou are Firoud, of the seed 
<A NAME="182"></A>of Saiawush."
<A NAME="183"></A><BR><BR>And Firoud answered, "Thou hast said. I am a branch of the cypress 
<A NAME="184"></A>that was struck down."
<A NAME="185"></A><BR><BR>. Then Bahram said, "Uncover thine arm, that I may behold the mark 
<A NAME="186"></A>of the Kaianides."
<A NAME="187"></A><BR><BR>And Firoud did so, and Bahram beheld the mark. Then he knew that 
<A NAME="188"></A>Firoud was of the race of Kai Kobad, and he did homage before him, and 
<A NAME="189"></A>he drew nigh unto him on the mountain. Then Firoud laid bare before Bahram 
<A NAME="190"></A>his desires, and he said how that he would make a great feast unto the 
<A NAME="191"></A>army in his house, and how, when this was done, he desired to take the 
<A NAME="192"></A>lead and march with it into Turan, and he craved Bahram to bear his words 
<A NAME="193"></A>of greeting unto Tus. And Bahram said-
<A NAME="194"></A><BR><BR>"O Prince, brave and young, I will bear thy message unto Tus, and 
<A NAME="195"></A>I will implore of him that he listen to thy voice. Yet because he is a 
<A NAME="196"></A>man easily angered, I fear the answer he may return. For though he be valiant, 
<A NAME="197"></A>yet is he also vain, and he cannot forget that he is sprung from the race 
<A NAME="198"></A>of the Kaianides, and he deemeth ever that the first place pertaineth unto 
<A NAME="199"></A>him."
<A NAME="200"></A><BR><BR>Then Bahram told Firoud wherefore he had been sent forth by Tus, 
<A NAME="201"></A>and he departed from him, saying-
<A NAME="202"></A><BR><BR>"If Tus hearken unto my voice, I will return unto thee; but if 
<A NAME="203"></A>thou beholdest another, confide not thyself to him."
<A NAME="204"></A><BR><BR>Then he departed, and came before Tus, and related to him all that 
<A NAME="205"></A>he had heard. And Tus was beside himself with anger, and he cried out against 
<A NAME="206"></A>this young man, and questioned wherefore he would usurp his place. And 
<A NAME="207"></A>he upbraided Bahram for that which he had done, and he refused to give 
<A NAME="208"></A>credit unto his words, and he sware that he would cause this youth to perish. 
<A NAME="209"></A>And he called upon his warriors, and bade them go forth and sever the head 
<A NAME="210"></A>of this Turk. But Bahram said unto them-
<A NAME="211"></A><BR><BR>"Ye know not that he sendeth you forth against Firoud, who is brother 
<A NAME="212"></A>unto Kai Khosrau, and sprung from the seed of Saiawush. I counsel you have 
<A NAME="213"></A>the fear of the Shah before your eyes, and lift not your hands in injustice 
<A NAME="214"></A>against his brother."
<A NAME="215"></A><BR><BR>When the warriors heard these words, they retreated back into the 
<A NAME="216"></A>tents. But Tus was angered exceedingly, and he commanded yet again that 
<A NAME="217"></A>one should go forth to do his behests. Then Rivniz, who was husband unto 
<A NAME="218"></A>the daughter of Tus, said that he would do his desires. So he rode forth 
<A NAME="219"></A>unto the mountain.
<A NAME="220"></A><BR><BR>Now when Firoud beheld a horseman, who brandished aloft his sword 
<A NAME="221"></A>in enmity, he said unto Tokhareh-
<A NAME="222"></A><BR><BR>"Tus despiseth my words, and since Bahram cometh not back, my heart 
<A NAME="223"></A>is disquieted. Look, I pray thee, if thou canst tell unto me what noble 
<A NAME="224"></A>this may be."
<A NAME="225"></A><BR><BR>And Tokhareh said, "It is Rivniz, a knight of great cunning, son 
<A NAME="226"></A>unto Tus, whose daughter he hath in marriage."
<A NAME="227"></A><BR><BR>Then Firoud asked, saying, "Since he attacketh me, whom shall I 
<A NAME="228"></A>slay-the steed or its rider?"
<A NAME="229"></A><BR><BR>And Tokhareh said, "Direct thine arms against the man, then perchance, 
<A NAME="230"></A>when Tus shall learn of his death, he will repent him that he listened 
<A NAME="231"></A>not unto thy words of peace."
<A NAME="232"></A><BR><BR>So Firoud bent his bow and shot Rivniz through the breast. And 
<A NAME="233"></A>he fell dead from off his saddle, and his horse turned him back in terror 
<A NAME="234"></A>unto the camp. Now when Tus beheld the horse that was come back without 
<A NAME="235"></A>its rider, he knew what was come to pass, and his anger against Firoud 
<A NAME="236"></A>burned yet the more. So he called unto him Zerasp his son, and bade him 
<A NAME="237"></A>go forth and avenge the blood of Rivniz. And when Firoud saw him approach, 
<A NAME="238"></A>he asked yet again the name of his foe, and he prepared his bow, that Tus 
<A NAME="239"></A>might learn that he was a man that should not be treated with dishonour. 
<A NAME="240"></A>And when Zerasp would have fought with him, he pinned him dead unto his 
<A NAME="241"></A>saddle. And the horse sped back with him into the camp, so that Tus saw 
<A NAME="242"></A>that which was come about. Then his fury knew no limit, and he sprang upon 
<A NAME="243"></A>his charger, and he set forth himself against Firoud.
<A NAME="244"></A><BR><BR>Now when Tokhareh beheld it, he said unto Firoud-
<A NAME="245"></A><BR>"Tus himself is come forth to combat thee, and thou canst not stand 
<A NAME="246"></A>against this crocodile. Retreat, therefore, I counsel thee, into thy castle, 
<A NAME="247"></A>and let us await the decrees of the stars."
<A NAME="248"></A><BR><BR>But Firoud answered in anger, "Who is Tus, that I should fear him? 
<A NAME="249"></A>I will not flee from his presence."
<A NAME="250"></A><BR><BR>Then Tokhareh said, "If thou be resolved to do battle with this 
<A NAME="251"></A>lion, I counsel thee that thou destroy him not, lest thy brother be angered 
<A NAME="252"></A>if the leader of his host perish by thy hand. Moreover, the army will come 
<A NAME="253"></A>forth to avenge him, and how canst thou stand against an host? Direct thine 
<A NAME="254"></A>arrows, therefore, against his charger, for a prince fighteth not on foot. 
<A NAME="255"></A>if, therefore, thou kill his horse from Under him, thou wilt have shown 
<A NAME="256"></A>unto him thy skill."
<A NAME="257"></A><BR><BR>Then Firoud did as Tokhareh counselled, and the arrow was faithful 
<A NAME="258"></A>to its aim, and he shot the horse of Tus from under him, and laid the charger 
<A NAME="259"></A>low upon the ground. And Tus had to turn him back on foot unto his camp, 
<A NAME="260"></A>and rage against Firoud burned in his spirit. And the nobles, when they 
<A NAME="261"></A>beheld their Pehliva treated thus with contempt,- were angry also, and 
<A NAME="262"></A>Gew said-
<A NAME="263"></A><BR><BR>"Who is this young man, that he despiseth an army, and how may 
<A NAME="264"></A>he treat us with disdain? 'Though he be of the race of the Kaianides, and 
<A NAME="265"></A>of the seed of Kai Kobad, he hath opened a door, and knoweth not whither 
<A NAME="266"></A>it leadeth."
<A NAME="267"></A><BR><BR>And as he spake he girded his armour about him, and made him ready 
<A NAME="268"></A>to go out against Firoud.
<A NAME="269"></A><BR><BR>Now when Firoud beheld him he sighed, and said, "This army is valiant, 
<A NAME="270"></A>but it cannot distinguish good from evil. I fear me that by them will Saiawush 
<A NAME="271"></A>not be avenged, for their leader is devoid of sense. Else could he not 
<A NAME="272"></A>persist in enmity against me. Tell me now, I pray, who this new foe may 
<A NAME="273"></A>be?"
<A NAME="274"></A><BR><BR>Then Tokhareh said, "It is Gew, the son of Gudarz, a knight of 
<A NAME="275"></A>great renown, before whom even the lion trembleth unto his marrow. And 
<A NAME="276"></A>he led forth thy brother into Iran, and he is girt with the armour of Saiawush, 
<A NAME="277"></A>that no man can pierce with in arrow. Direct thy bow, therefore, yet again 
<A NAME="278"></A>unto the charger, or thy strife will be vain."
<A NAME="279"></A><BR><BR>And Firoud the brave did as Tokhareh said, and he sent forth his 
<A NAME="280"></A>arrow, and the horse of Gew sank unto the earth. Now all the nobles rejoiced 
<A NAME="281"></A>when Gew returned unto them in safety; but Byzun, his son, was wroth, and 
<A NAME="282"></A>he upbraided his father, and he said-
<A NAME="283"></A><BR><BR>"O thou who fearest not an army, how canst thou turn thee back 
<A NAME="284"></A>before a single knight?"
<A NAME="285"></A><BR><BR>Then he sware a great oath that he would not quit the saddle until 
<A NAME="286"></A>the blood of Rivniz and of Zerasp should be avenged.
<A NAME="287"></A><BR><BR>Now Gew was afraid for his son, who was young, and would have restrained 
<A NAME="288"></A>him. But Byzun suffered it not, and when his father saw that he was resolved, 
<A NAME="289"></A>he gave unto him the armour of Saiawush, and sent him forth unto the 
<A NAME="290"></A>mountain.
<A NAME="291"></A><BR><BR>Now when Firoud saw that yet another was come out against him, 
<A NAME="292"></A>he questioned Tokhareh again of his name. And Tokhareh 
<A NAME="293"></A>said-
<A NAME="294"></A><BR><BR>"It is a youth who hath not his like in Iran. Byzun is he called, 
<A NAME="295"></A>and he is only son unto Gew the brave. And because that he is clad in the 
<A NAME="296"></A>armour of Saiawush, thy father, strike at his horse, or thy bow will avail 
<A NAME="297"></A>thee nought."
<A NAME="298"></A><BR><BR>So Firoud shot his arrows at the horse, and he laid it low, as 
<A NAME="299"></A>he had done the others. Then Byzun cried, saying-
<A NAME="300"></A><BR><BR>"O young man, who aimest thus surely, thou shalt behold how warriors 
<A NAME="301"></A>fight on foot."
<A NAME="302"></A><BR><BR>And he ran up the side of the mountain, that he might come near 
<A NAME="303"></A>unto Firoud. But Firoud turned and entered in upon his gates, and he rained 
<A NAME="304"></A>down stones from his walls upon the head of his adversary. Then Byzun taunted 
<A NAME="305"></A>him, and said-
<A NAME="306"></A><BR><BR>"O hero of renown, thou fliest before a man on foot, thou who art 
<A NAME="307"></A>brave! Alas! whither is vanished thy courage? "
<A NAME="308"></A><BR><BR>Then he returned unto the camp, and told unto Tus how that this 
<A NAME="309"></A>scion of the Kaianides was filled with valour, and how his bow was sure, 
<A NAME="310"></A>and he said that he feared no man could stand against him. But Tus said, 
<A NAME="311"></A>"I will raze unto the dust his castle, I will destroy this Turk, and avenge 
<A NAME="312"></A>the blood that he hath spilled."
<A NAME="313"></A><BR><BR>Now when the brilliant sun was vanished and the black night had 
<A NAME="314"></A>invaded the earth with her army of stars, Firoud caused his castle to be 
<A NAME="315"></A>strengthened. And while he did so, his mother dreamed a dream of evil portent, 
<A NAME="316"></A>and she came forth weeping before her son. And she spake, 
<A NAME="317"></A>saying-
<A NAME="318"></A><BR><BR>"O my son, the stars are evil disposed towards us, and I am afraid 
<A NAME="319"></A>for thee."
<A NAME="320"></A><BR><BR>Then Firoud answered her, saying, "Woe unto thee, my mother, for 
<A NAME="321"></A>I know it is not given unto thee to cease from shedding tears of sorrow. 
<A NAME="322"></A>For verily I shall perish like unto my father, in the flower of my youth. 
<A NAME="323"></A>Yet will I not crave mercy of these Iranians."
<A NAME="324"></A><BR><BR>And he bade her go back unto the chamber of the women, and pray 
<A NAME="325"></A>God for his soul.
<A NAME="326"></A><BR><BR>Now when the sun returned and lifted his glorious face above the 
<A NAME="327"></A>vault of heaven, there was heard the sound of armour on all sides, and 
<A NAME="328"></A>Firoud beheld that the host of Iran was come forth against him. So he went 
<A NAME="329"></A>out beyond the gates, leading his warriors. And since there was no plain 
<A NAME="330"></A>whereon they could give battle, they fought upon the mountain-side, and 
<A NAME="331"></A>many were the Turkish heads that were felled. But Firoud made great havoc 
<A NAME="332"></A>among his enemies, and they beheld that he was a lion in the fight. But 
<A NAME="333"></A>the stars of the young hero were waning, for even a brave man cannot contend 
<A NAME="334"></A>alone against an host. For when he would have ridden back unto his castle, 
<A NAME="335"></A>Rehham and Byzun lay in ambush against him, and they closed unto him the 
<A NAME="336"></A>two ends of the path. But Firoud was not dismayed thereat. He fell upon 
<A NAME="337"></A>the son of Gew, and would have slain him; but Rehham came upon him from 
<A NAME="338"></A>behind, and struck him down with a mighty club. Then Firoud knew that his 
<A NAME="339"></A>hour was come, and he returned unto his mother. Now when she saw him she 
<A NAME="340"></A>raised a great cry, but he bade her keep silence, and he spake, 
<A NAME="341"></A>saying-
<A NAME="342"></A><BR><BR>"Weep not, for the time suffereth it not. For the Iranians follow 
<A NAME="343"></A>fast upon me, and they will enter and take this house, and do violence 
<A NAME="344"></A>unto thee and to thy women. Go out, therefore, and cast you from off the 
<A NAME="345"></A>walls into the abyss, that death may come upon you, and that Byzun when 
<A NAME="346"></A>he entereth find none alive. As for me, my moments are but few, for the 
<A NAME="347"></A>heroes of Iran have murdered the days of my youth."
<A NAME="348"></A><BR><BR>And the women did as he commanded, save only his mother, who abode 
<A NAME="349"></A>beside him until the breath was gone out from his body. Then she made a 
<A NAME="350"></A>great fire, and threw therein all his treasures, and she went out into 
<A NAME="351"></A>the stables and laid low the horses that were therein. And when she had 
<A NAME="352"></A>made the place a desert unto the Iranians, she returned unto the feet of 
<A NAME="353"></A>her son, and pierced her body with a sword.
<A NAME="354"></A><BR><BR>Now when the Iranians had broken down the bars of the gates and 
<A NAME="355"></A>entered into the castle, they came unto the chamber and beheld the bodies 
<A NAME="356"></A>of Firoud and of his mother. And when they saw them, they could not withhold 
<A NAME="357"></A>their tears, and they sorrowed for the anger of Tus, and the fear of Kai 
<A NAME="358"></A>Khosrau came upon them. And Gudarz said unto Tus-
<A NAME="359"></A><BR><BR>"Thou hast sown hatred, and thou wilt reap war. It beseemeth not 
<A NAME="360"></A>a leader to be quick to ire. Thy haste hath brought to death a youth of 
<A NAME="361"></A>the race of the Kaianides, and hath caused the blood of thy sons to be 
<A NAME="362"></A>spilled."
<A NAME="363"></A><BR><BR>When Tus heard these words he wept in his sorrow, and 
<A NAME="364"></A>said-
<A NAME="365"></A><BR>"Evil fortune is come upon me."
<A NAME="366"></A><BR>Then he caused a royal tomb to be made, and seated Firoud therein upon 
<A NAME="367"></A>a throne of gold, and he decked him with all the signs of kingship. And 
<A NAME="368"></A>when he had so done he returned with his army unto the plains, and three 
<A NAME="369"></A>days they halted in their grief. But on the fourth the trumpets were sounded 
<A NAME="370"></A>for departure, and Tus led forth the army towards Turan.
<A NAME="371"></A><BR><BR>Now when Afrasiyab learned that a host was come forth against him 
<A NAME="372"></A>from out of Iran, he bade Piran make ready his army. For he 
<A NAME="373"></A>said-
<A NAME="374"></A><BR><BR>"Kai Khosrau hath unveiled unto us the secrets of his heart, and 
<A NAME="375"></A>we know now that forgiveness is not hidden in his soul."
<A NAME="376"></A><BR><BR>Now while they made them in order, there came a great storm of 
<A NAME="377"></A>snow that covered the earth like to a carpet, and the water became hard, 
<A NAME="378"></A>and for many days no man beheld the earth or the sun. And food was lacking 
<A NAME="379"></A>unto the Iranians, and they were fain to devour their steeds of battle. 
<A NAME="380"></A>And when at last the sun came back, the earth was changed into a lake, 
<A NAME="381"></A>and the Iranians suffered yet again. Then Tus said-
<A NAME="382"></A><BR><BR>"Let us return whence we came forth."
<A NAME="383"></A><BR>But his army said, "Not so. Shall we flee before the face of 
<A NAME="384"></A>Afrasiyab?"
<A NAME="385"></A><BR><BR>So they made them ready to meet their foes. And they fought right 
<A NAME="386"></A>valiantly, and many were the heads of Turan that were laid in the dust 
<A NAME="387"></A>by their hands, and the victory inclined towards them. Then Tus was glad, 
<A NAME="388"></A>and made a great feast and invited thereto his warriors. And he darkened 
<A NAME="389"></A>their heads with wine, so that they laid aside their armour, neither did 
<A NAME="390"></A>they set watches in the camp. Now Piran, when he learned of this, saw that 
<A NAME="391"></A>the time served him, and when the night was fallen he went out against 
<A NAME="392"></A>the camp of Iran. And all the nobles were drunk save only Gudarz the wise. 
<A NAME="393"></A>Now when he heard that the Turanians were come into the camp, he ran to 
<A NAME="394"></A>the tents of Tus and cried, saying-
<A NAME="395"></A><BR><BR>"Is this the hour to hold the wine-cup?"
<A NAME="396"></A><BR>Then he called together his sons, and he set his army in order; but 
<A NAME="397"></A>the Turanians routed them utterly, for the men of Iran were heavy with 
<A NAME="398"></A>wine, and they knew not whither they sent their blows. And the carnage 
<A NAME="399"></A>was great, and when the sun had brought back the day the ground was strewn 
<A NAME="400"></A>thick with the bodies of the Iranians. And cries of agony were heard around, 
<A NAME="401"></A>and there were none to heal the hurts, for those that were whole were captive. 
<A NAME="402"></A>And Tus was beside himself for sorrow, and Gudarz alone was not defraught 
<A NAME="403"></A>of reason. So the old man sent forth a messenger to bear the tidings of 
<A NAME="404"></A>woe unto the Shah. Now he was a messenger that made the earth disappear 
<A NAME="405"></A>beneath his feet, and speedily did he stand within the courts of the King. 
<A NAME="406"></A>And Kai Khosrau, when he had listened to his words, was angered, and his 
<A NAME="407"></A>tongue called down curses on the head of Tus. Then he pondered all night 
<A NAME="408"></A>how he should act, but when the cock crew he wrote a letter unto Friburz 
<A NAME="409"></A>the son of Kai Kaous. And he bade him take unto him the flag of Kawah and 
<A NAME="410"></A>the golden boots, and lead the army in the place of Tus. And he bade him 
<A NAME="411"></A>in all things be obedient to the counsels of Gudarz the wise, and he recalled 
<A NAME="412"></A>how Tus had disobeyed his commandments, and he said-
<A NAME="413"></A><BR><BR><B>"I know no longer who is my friend or my 
<A NAME="414"></A>foe."</B>
<A NAME="415"></A><BR>Then he put his seal to the letter and gave it unto the messenger. 
<A NAME="416"></A>And the man sped forth and brought it into the camp. Then Friburz read 
<A NAME="417"></A>it out before the army. And when he had heard it Tus did that which the 
<A NAME="418"></A>Shah desired, and when he had given over unto Friburz the command he turned 
<A NAME="419"></A>him to go back unto Iran.
<A NAME="420"></A><BR><BR>Now when he was come before Kai Khosrau, he fell upon the earth 
<A NAME="421"></A>before his throne, and the Shah raised him not, neither did he give him 
<A NAME="422"></A>words of greeting. And when he parted his lips, it was to let forth words 
<A NAME="423"></A>of anger. And he made known to him his sore displeasure, and he reproached 
<A NAME="424"></A>him with the death of Firoud, and he said-
<A NAME="425"></A><BR><BR>"But that thou art sprung from Minuchihr, and that thy beard is 
<A NAME="426"></A>white, I would sever thy head from off thy body for this deed. Yet, as 
<A NAME="427"></A>it is, a dungeon shall be thy dwelling, and thine evil nature thy 
<A NAME="428"></A>gaoler."
<A NAME="429"></A><BR><BR>And when he had thus spoken he drove him from his presence, and 
<A NAME="430"></A>gave orders that he should be put into chains.
<A NAME="431"></A><BR><BR>Now while these things passed in Iran, Friburz craved of Piran 
<A NAME="432"></A>that he would grant unto him a truce. And Piran said-
<A NAME="433"></A><BR><BR>"It is ye who have broken into our land; yet I will listen unto 
<A NAME="434"></A>your desires and grant unto you this truce, and it shall be of the length 
<A NAME="435"></A>of one moon. But I counsel unto you that ye quit the land of Turan in its 
<A NAME="436"></A>course."
<A NAME="437"></A><BR><BR>But Friburz would not Lead back the army thus discomfited, and 
<A NAME="438"></A>he spent the time accorded to him in preparation, and when it was at an 
<A NAME="439"></A>end he offered battle again to the Turanians. And there was waged a combat 
<A NAME="440"></A>s sun hath not looked upon its like, and the army of the Iranians was overthrown. 
<A NAME="441"></A>And the slaughter was terrible, neither did the men of Turan escape, and 
<A NAME="442"></A>many were the great ones of the land that perished. And the men of Iran 
<A NAME="443"></A>fought till that their strength was departed. They had sought the conflict 
<A NAME="444"></A>and found defeat. And they that were not slain fled from the battlefield, 
<A NAME="445"></A>and it is they that saved their lives in this manner whom thou must 
<A NAME="446"></A>bewail.
<A NAME="447"></A><BR><BR>Now when another day was risen upon the world, Piran sent for his 
<A NAME="448"></A>guards to bring him news of the Iranians. And when they told him that their 
<A NAME="449"></A>tents were vanished from off the plains, he sent the news of victory to 
<A NAME="450"></A>Afrasiyab. And the King rejoiced thereat, and all the land prepared a great 
<A NAME="451"></A>feast unto the army. And when Piran entered into the city the terraces 
<A NAME="452"></A>thereof were decked with carpets of gay hue, and the houses were clothed 
<A NAME="453"></A>with arras of Roum, and pieces of silver rained down upon the warriors. 
<A NAME="454"></A>And the King poured upon Piran gifts of such number that you would not 
<A NAME="455"></A>have patience to hear me recount them. And he sent him back unto Khoten 
<A NAME="456"></A>with much honour and many counsels. And he said-
<A NAME="457"></A><BR><BR>"Let not thine army slumber, and trust not thy foe because he is 
<A NAME="458"></A>drawn back. I charge thee keep thine eyes fixed upon the land of Rustem, 
<A NAME="459"></A>for if thy vigilance slumber he will surely come forth and destroy thee, 
<A NAME="460"></A>for he alone is to be feared of the men of Iran. Therefore be brave and 
<A NAME="461"></A>watchful, and may Heaven preserve thee unto my throne."
<A NAME="462"></A><BR><BR>And Piran listened unto the words spoken of Afrasiyab, as it beseemed 
<A NAME="463"></A>him. And when he was returned unto his kingdom, he set watchers upon all 
<A NAME="464"></A>sides, that they might acquaint him concerning Rustem the 
<A NAME="465"></A>Pehliva.
