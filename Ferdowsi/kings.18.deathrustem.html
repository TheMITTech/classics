<A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A>How shall a man escape from that which is written; How shall he flee from 
<A NAME="11"></A>his destiny?
<A NAME="12"></A><BR><BR>There stood a slave in the house of Zal, and she was fair to see, 
<A NAME="13"></A>so that the heart of the aged man went out to her. And there was born to 
<A NAME="14"></A>her a son, goodly of mien, like unto Saum the hero, and Zal named him Shugdad. 
<A NAME="15"></A>Then he consulted the Mubids concerning him, and they searched the stars 
<A NAME="16"></A>for his destiny, and they read therein that he would do much evil in the 
<A NAME="17"></A>house of his father, and lay low the race of Saum, the son of Neriman. 
<A NAME="18"></A>Now Zal, when he heard this, was sore afflicted, and he prayed unto God 
<A NAME="19"></A>that He would avert this fate from his head. And he reared him tenderly, 
<A NAME="20"></A>and when he was come unto man's estate he sent him forth into Cabul. And 
<A NAME="21"></A>the King of Cabul rejoiced in the sight of the hero, and he kept him beside 
<A NAME="22"></A>him and gave unto him his daughter to wife.
<A NAME="23"></A><BR><BR>Now the King of Cabul paid tribute unto Rustem, and it was a grievance 
<A NAME="24"></A>to him to do so, and since he had taken Shugdad as his son he deemed that 
<A NAME="25"></A>it was fitting that he should be relieved of this burden. And he spake 
<A NAME="26"></A>thereof unto Shugdad, and said how Rustem ceased not to demand 
<A NAME="27"></A>it.
<A NAME="28"></A><BR><BR>And Shugdad said, "This man is foolish. What mattereth it whether 
<A NAME="29"></A>he be my brother or a stranger, let us consider how we may ensnare 
<A NAME="30"></A>him."
<A NAME="31"></A><BR><BR>So Shugdad and the King of Cabul passed a night pondering how they 
<A NAME="32"></A>should bring Rustem unto destruction. And Shugdad said-
<A NAME="33"></A><BR><BR>"Call together thy nobles unto a feast, and when thou shalt have 
<A NAME="34"></A>drunk wine, speak insults unto me, and I will be angered and ride forth 
<A NAME="35"></A>unto Zaboulistan and make plaint of thee before Rustem, and assuredly he 
<A NAME="36"></A>will come forth to avenge me. And while I am gone, cause a deep pit to 
<A NAME="37"></A>be dug on the road that Rustem must pass, a pit that will swallow him and 
<A NAME="38"></A>Rakush his steed, and line the sides thereof with sharp spears, and swords, 
<A NAME="39"></A>and lances. And when it is done, cover it with earth and let no man know 
<A NAME="40"></A>thereof, nay, whisper it not even unto the moon."
<A NAME="41"></A><BR><BR>And the King said, "Thy device is good," and he made a great feast 
<A NAME="42"></A>and called thereto his warriors, and he spake words of insult unto Shugdad, 
<A NAME="43"></A>and he reproached him, and said that he was not of the race of Saum, but 
<A NAME="44"></A>son unto a slave. And he said that Rudabeh would refuse to him the name 
<A NAME="45"></A>of brother unto Rustem. And he spake lightly also of Rustem. Then Shugdad 
<A NAME="46"></A>uprose as though he were angered, and vowed that he would ride unto Zaboulistan 
<A NAME="47"></A>and call forth Rustem to avenge the words that the King had 
<A NAME="48"></A>spoken.
<A NAME="49"></A><BR><BR>Now when Shugdad was come unto the courts of Zal, and had told 
<A NAME="50"></A>unto Rustem the words that the King of Cabul had spoken, he was beside 
<A NAME="51"></A>himself with anger, and he said-
<A NAME="52"></A><BR><BR>"I will slake my vengeance for this speech."
<A NAME="53"></A><BR>Then he chose out an army and made ready to go into Cabul. But Shugdad 
<A NAME="54"></A>said-
<A NAME="55"></A><BR><BR>"Wherefore dost thou take forth so large an army? Surely Cabul 
<A NAME="56"></A>shall be obedient when it but looketh upon thy face. Yet this army will 
<A NAME="57"></A>cause the King to think that thou holdest him an enemy worthy of 
<A NAME="58"></A>regard."
<A NAME="59"></A><BR><BR>Then Rustem said, "That which thou sayest, it is wise," and he 
<A NAME="60"></A>disbanded the army, and took with him but few men and rode with them to 
<A NAME="61"></A>Cabul.
<A NAME="62"></A><BR><BR>In the mean season the King of Cabul had done that which Shugdad 
<A NAME="63"></A>had counselled, and the pits that had been dug were concealed with cunning. 
<A NAME="64"></A>Now when Rustem came nigh to the city, Shugdad sent a messenger before 
<A NAME="65"></A>him unto the King of Cabul, saying-
<A NAME="66"></A><BR><BR>"Rustem cometh against thee, it behoveth thee to ask pardon for 
<A NAME="67"></A>thy words."
<A NAME="68"></A><BR><BR>And the King came forth, and his tongue was filled with honey, 
<A NAME="69"></A>but his heart was filled with poison. And he bowed himself in the dust 
<A NAME="70"></A>before Rustem, and he asked his forgiveness for the words that he had spoken, 
<A NAME="71"></A>and he said-
<A NAME="72"></A><BR><BR>"Consider not the words of thy servant that he did speak when his 
<A NAME="73"></A>head was troubled with wine."
<A NAME="74"></A><BR><BR>And Rustem forgave the King, and consented to be his guest. Then 
<A NAME="75"></A>a great banquet was made, and while they feasted the King told unto Rustem 
<A NAME="76"></A>how his forests were filled with wild asses and with rams, and he invited 
<A NAME="77"></A>him to hunt therein ere he should return unto Zaboulistan. And these words 
<A NAME="78"></A>were joy unto the ears of Rustem, and he consented unto the desires of 
<A NAME="79"></A>the King. So the next day the King made ready a great hunt, and he led 
<A NAME="80"></A>it unto the spot where the pits were hidden. And Shugdad ran beside the 
<A NAME="81"></A>horse of Rustem, and showed unto him the path. But Rakush, when he smelt 
<A NAME="82"></A>the soil that had been newly turned, reared him in air, and refused to 
<A NAME="83"></A>go onwards. Then Rustem commanded him to go forward, but Rakush would not 
<A NAME="84"></A>listen to his voice. And Rustem was angry when he beheld that Rakush was 
<A NAME="85"></A>afraid. But Rakush sprang back yet again. Then Rustem took a whip and struck 
<A NAME="86"></A>him, and before this day he had never raised his hand against his steed. 
<A NAME="87"></A>So Rakush was grieved in his soul, and he did that which Rustem desired, 
<A NAME="88"></A>and he sprang forward and fell into the pit. And the sharp spears entered 
<A NAME="89"></A>his body and tore it, and they pierced also the flesh of Rustem, and steed 
<A NAME="90"></A>and rider were impaled upon the irons that had been hidden by the King. 
<A NAME="91"></A>But Rustem put forth all his strength, and raised himself. Yet when he 
<A NAME="92"></A>had done it he was weary, and fell down beside the pit. And he swooned 
<A NAME="93"></A>in his agony.
<A NAME="94"></A><BR><BR>Now when Rustem was come unto himself, he saw Shugdad, and he beheld 
<A NAME="95"></A>in his face the joy felt of this evil man at this adventure. Then he knew 
<A NAME="96"></A>that it was his brother that was his foe. So he said unto 
<A NAME="97"></A>him-
<A NAME="98"></A><BR><BR>"It is thou who hast done this deed."
<A NAME="99"></A><BR>And Shugdad said, "Thou hast caused many to perish by the sword; it 
<A NAME="100"></A>is meet that thou shouldst perish by it thyself."
<A NAME="101"></A><BR><BR>Now while they yet spake, the King of Cabul came nigh unto the 
<A NAME="102"></A>spot. And when he beheld Rustem, that weltered in his blood, he feigned 
<A NAME="103"></A>a great sorrow, and he cried-
<A NAME="104"></A><BR><BR>"O hero of renown, what thing hath befallen 
<A NAME="105"></A>thee?
<A NAME="106"></A><BR>I will send forth my physicians, that they heal 
<A NAME="107"></A>thee."
<A NAME="108"></A><BR>And Rustem said, "O man of wile, the time of physicians is gone by, 
<A NAME="109"></A>and there is none that can heal me, save only death, that cometh to all 
<A NAME="110"></A>men in their turn."
<A NAME="111"></A><BR><BR>Then he said unto Shugdad, "Give unto me my bow, and place before 
<A NAME="112"></A>me two arrows, and refuse not unto me this last request. For I would have 
<A NAME="113"></A>them beside me lest a lion go by ere I am dead, and devour me for his 
<A NAME="114"></A>prey."
<A NAME="115"></A><BR><BR>And Shugdad gave unto Rustem his bow; but when he had done so he 
<A NAME="116"></A>was afraid, and he ran unto a plane tree that stood near by. And the tree 
<A NAME="117"></A>was old and hollow, and Shugdad hid himself in its trunk. But Rustem beheld 
<A NAME="118"></A>him where he was hid, though the dimness of death was come over his eyes. 
<A NAME="119"></A>So he raised him from the ground in his agony, and he took his bow and 
<A NAME="120"></A>bent it with force, and he shot an arrow and fixed Shugdad unto the tree 
<A NAME="121"></A>wherein he was hid. And the aim was just, and pierced even unto the heart 
<A NAME="122"></A>of this evil man, so that he died. And Rustem, when he saw it, smiled, 
<A NAME="123"></A>and said-
<A NAME="124"></A><BR><BR>"Thanks be unto God, the Merciful, whom all my days I have sought 
<A NAME="125"></A>to serve, that He hath granted unto me to avenge myself upon this wretch 
<A NAME="126"></A>while the life is yet in me, and ere two nights have passed over this 
<A NAME="127"></A>vengeance."
<A NAME="128"></A><BR><BR>But when he had so spoken the breath went out of him, and the hero 
<A NAME="129"></A>who had borne high his head was vanished from this world.
<A NAME="130"></A><BR><BR>Now a warrior of the train of Rustem rode with all speed unto Zaboulistan, 
<A NAME="131"></A>and told unto Zal the tidings of sorrow. And Zal was dismayed thereat, 
<A NAME="132"></A>and his grief was boundless, and he cried continually after his son, and 
<A NAME="133"></A>he heaped curses upon Shugdad, that had uprooted this royal tree. And he 
<A NAME="134"></A>said-
<A NAME="135"></A><BR><BR>"Wherefore have I been suffered to see this day? Wherefore have 
<A NAME="136"></A>I not died before Rustem, my son? Wherefore am I left alone to mourn his 
<A NAME="137"></A>memory?"
<A NAME="138"></A><BR><BR>Now while he lamented thus, Feramorz, the son of Rustem, gathered 
<A NAME="139"></A>together an army to avenge his father. And he went into Cabul, and he laid 
<A NAME="140"></A>low all the men he found therein, and he slew the King and all his house, 
<A NAME="141"></A>and he changed the land into a desert. And when he had done so, he sought 
<A NAME="142"></A>out the body of Rustem, and of Rakush his steed, and he did unto them all 
<A NAME="143"></A>honour, and they were borne in sorrow unto Zaboulistan. And Zal caused 
<A NAME="144"></A>a noble tomb to be built for Rustem, his son, and he laid him therein, 
<A NAME="145"></A>and there was placed beside him also Rakush, the steed that had served 
<A NAME="146"></A>him unto the end.
<A NAME="147"></A><BR><BR>And the wailing throughout the land because of the death of Rustem 
<A NAME="148"></A>was such as the world hath not known the like. And Zal was crushed with 
<A NAME="149"></A>sorrow, and Rudabeh was distraught with grief. And for many moons were 
<A NAME="150"></A>no sounds save those of wailing heard in the courts of Seistan. And Rudabeh 
<A NAME="151"></A>refused to take comfort, and she cried without ceasing-
<A NAME="152"></A><BR><BR>"He is gone before us, but we shall follow. Let us rest our hopes 
<A NAME="153"></A>in God."
<A NAME="154"></A><BR><BR>And she gave unto the poor of her treasures, and daily she prayed 
<A NAME="155"></A>unto Ormuzd, saying-
<A NAME="156"></A><BR><BR>"O Thou who reignest above, to whom alone pertaineth honour and 
<A NAME="157"></A>glory, purify the soul of Rustem from all sin, and grant that he rejoice 
<A NAME="158"></A>in the fruits that he hath sown on earth, and give him a place beside 
<A NAME="159"></A>Thee."
<A NAME="160"></A><BR><BR>And now may the blessing of God rest upon all men. I have told 
<A NAME="161"></A>unto them the Epic of Kings, and the Epic of Kings is come to a close, 
<A NAME="162"></A>and the tale of their deeds is ended.
