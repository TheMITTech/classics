<A NAME="10"></A><B>How Hercules' Grandson Perished in Fight With the Son of 
<A NAME="11"></A>Achilles</B>
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="12"></A>When from the far sea-line, where is the cave
<A NAME="13"></A><BR>Of Dawn, rose up the sun, and scattered light
<A NAME="14"></A><BR>Over the earth, then did the eager sons
<A NAME="15"></A><BR>Of Troy and of Achaea arm themselves
<A NAME="16"></A><BR>Athirst for battle: these Achilles' son
<A NAME="17"></A><BR>Cheered on to face the Trojans awelessly;
<A NAME="18"></A><BR>And those the giant strength of Telephus' seed
<A NAME="19"></A><BR>Kindled.  He trusted to dash down the wall
<A NAME="20"></A><BR>To earth, and utterly destroy the ships
<A NAME="21"></A><BR>With ravening fire, and slay the Argive host.
<A NAME="22"></A><BR>Ah, but his hope was as the morning breeze
<A NAME="23"></A><BR>Delusive: hard beside him stood the Fates
<A NAME="24"></A><BR>Laughing to scorn his vain imaginings.
<A NAME="25"></A><BR><BR>Then to the Myrmidons spake Achilles' son,
<A NAME="26"></A><BR>The aweless, to the fight enkindling them:
<A NAME="27"></A><BR>"Hear me, mine henchmen: take ye to your hearts
<A NAME="28"></A><BR>The spirit of war, that we may heal the wounds
<A NAME="29"></A><BR>Of Argos, and be ruin to her foes.
<A NAME="30"></A><BR>Let no man fear, for mighty prowess is
<A NAME="31"></A><BR>The child of courage; but fear slayeth strength
<A NAME="32"></A><BR>And spirit.  Gird yourselves with strength for war;
<A NAME="33"></A><BR>Give foes no breathing-space, that they may say
<A NAME="34"></A><BR>That mid our ranks Achilles liveth yet."
<A NAME="35"></A><BR><BR>Then clad he with his father's flashing arms
<A NAME="36"></A><BR>His shoulders.  Then exulted Thetis' heart
<A NAME="37"></A><BR>When from the sea she saw the mighty strength
<A NAME="38"></A><BR>Of her son's son.  Then forth with eagle-speed
<A NAME="39"></A><BR>Afront of that high wall he rushed, his ear
<A NAME="40"></A><BR>Drawn by the immortal horses of his sire.
<A NAME="41"></A><BR>As from the ocean-verge upsprings the sun
<A NAME="42"></A><BR>In glory, flashing fire far over earth --
<A NAME="43"></A><BR>Fire, when beside his radiant chariot-team
<A NAME="44"></A><BR>Races the red star Sirius, scatterer
<A NAME="45"></A><BR>Of woefullest diseases over men;
<A NAME="46"></A><BR>So flashed upon the eyes of Ilium's host
<A NAME="47"></A><BR>That battle-eager hero, Achilles' son.
<A NAME="48"></A><BR>Onward they whirled him, those immortal steeds,
<A NAME="49"></A><BR>The which, when now he longed to chase the foe
<A NAME="50"></A><BR>Back from the ships, Automedon, who wont
<A NAME="51"></A><BR>To rein them for his father, brought to him.
<A NAME="52"></A><BR>With joy that pair bore battleward their lord,
<A NAME="53"></A><BR>So like to Aeacus' son, their deathless hearts
<A NAME="54"></A><BR>Held him no worser than Achilles' self.
<A NAME="55"></A><BR>Laughing for glee the Argives gathered round
<A NAME="56"></A><BR>The might resistless of Neoptolemus,
<A NAME="57"></A><BR>Eager for fight as wasps [whose woodland bower
<A NAME="58"></A><BR>The axe] hath shaken, who dart swarming forth
<A NAME="59"></A><BR>Furious to sting the woodman: round their nest
<A NAME="60"></A><BR>Long eddying, they torment all passers by;
<A NAME="61"></A><BR>So streamed they forth from galley and from wall
<A NAME="62"></A><BR>Burning for fight, and that wide space was thronged,
<A NAME="63"></A><BR>And all the plain far blazed with armour-sheen,
<A NAME="64"></A><BR>As shone from heaven's vault the sun thereon.
<A NAME="65"></A><BR>As flees the cloud-rack through the welkin wide
<A NAME="66"></A><BR>Scourged onward by the North-wind's Titan blasts,
<A NAME="67"></A><BR>When winter-tide and snow are hard at hand,
<A NAME="68"></A><BR>And darkness overpalls the firmament;
<A NAME="69"></A><BR>So with their thronging squadrons was the earth
<A NAME="70"></A><BR>Covered before the ships.  To heaven uprolled,
<A NAME="71"></A><BR>Dust hung on hovering wings' men's armour clashed;
<A NAME="72"></A><BR>Rattled a thousand chariots; horses neighed
<A NAME="73"></A><BR>On-rushing to the fray.  Each warrior's prowess
<A NAME="74"></A><BR>Kindled him with its trumpet-call to war.
<A NAME="75"></A><BR><BR>As leap the long sea-rollers, onward hurled
<A NAME="76"></A><BR>By two winds terribly o'er th' broad sea-flood
<A NAME="77"></A><BR>Roaring from viewless bournes, with whirlwind blasts
<A NAME="78"></A><BR>Crashing together, when a ruining storm
<A NAME="79"></A><BR>Maddens along the wide gulfs of the deep,
<A NAME="80"></A><BR>And moans the Sea-queen with her anguished waves
<A NAME="81"></A><BR>Which sweep from every hand, uptowering
<A NAME="82"></A><BR>Like precipiced mountains, while the bitter squall,
<A NAME="83"></A><BR>Ceaselessly veering, shrieks across the sea;
<A NAME="84"></A><BR>So clashed in strife those hosts from either hand
<A NAME="85"></A><BR>With mad rage.  Strife incarnate spurred them on,
<A NAME="86"></A><BR>And their own prowess.  Crashed together these
<A NAME="87"></A><BR>Like thunderclouds outlightening, thrilling the 
<A NAME="88"></A>air.
<A NAME="89"></A><BR>With shattering trumpet-challenge, when the blasts
<A NAME="90"></A><BR>Are locked in frenzied wrestle, with mad breath
<A NAME="91"></A><BR>Rending the clouds, when Zeus is wroth with men
<A NAME="92"></A><BR>Who travail with iniquity, and flout
<A NAME="93"></A><BR>His law.  So grappled they, as spear with spear
<A NAME="94"></A><BR>Clashed, shield with shield, and man on man was 
<A NAME="95"></A>hurled.
<A NAME="96"></A><BR><BR>And first Achilles' war-impetuous son
<A NAME="97"></A><BR>Struck down stout Melaneus and Alcidamas,
<A NAME="98"></A><BR>Sons of the war-lord Alexinomus,
<A NAME="99"></A><BR>Who dwelt in Caunus mountain-cradled, nigh
<A NAME="100"></A><BR>The clear lake shining at Tarbelus' feet
<A NAME="101"></A><BR>'Neath snow-capt Imbrus.  Menes, fleetfoot son
<A NAME="102"></A><BR>Of King Cassandrus, slew he, born to him
<A NAME="103"></A><BR>By fair Creusa, where the lovely streams
<A NAME="104"></A><BR>Of Lindus meet the sea, beside the marches
<A NAME="105"></A><BR>Of battle-biding Carians, and the heights
<A NAME="106"></A><BR>Of Lycia the renowned.  He slew withal
<A NAME="107"></A><BR>Morys the spearman, who from Phrygia came;
<A NAME="108"></A><BR>Polybus and Hippomedon by his side
<A NAME="109"></A><BR>He laid, this stabbed to the heart, that pierced 
<A NAME="110"></A>between
<A NAME="111"></A><BR>Shoulder and neck: man after man he slew.
<A NAME="112"></A><BR>Earth groaned 'neath Trojan corpses; rank on rank
<A NAME="113"></A><BR>Crumbled before him, even as parched brakes
<A NAME="114"></A><BR>Sink down before the blast of ravening fire
<A NAME="115"></A><BR>When the north wind of latter summer blows;
<A NAME="116"></A><BR>So ruining squadrons fell before his charge.
<A NAME="117"></A><BR><BR>Meanwhile Aeneas slew Aristolochus,
<A NAME="118"></A><BR>Crashing a great stone down on his head: it brake
<A NAME="119"></A><BR>Helmet and skull together, and fled his life.
<A NAME="120"></A><BR>Fleetfoot Eumaeus Diomede slew; he dwelt
<A NAME="121"></A><BR>In craggy Dardanus, where the bride-bed is
<A NAME="122"></A><BR>Whereon Anchises clasped the Queen of Love.
<A NAME="123"></A><BR>Agamemnon smote down Stratus: unto Thrace
<A NAME="124"></A><BR>Returned he not from war, but died far off
<A NAME="125"></A><BR>From his dear fatherland.  And Meriones
<A NAME="126"></A><BR>Struck Chlemus down, Peisenor's son, the friend
<A NAME="127"></A><BR>Of god-like Glaucus, and his comrade leal,
<A NAME="128"></A><BR>Who by Limurus' outfall dwelt: the folk
<A NAME="129"></A><BR>Honoured him as their king, when reigned no more
<A NAME="130"></A><BR>Glaucus, in battle slain, -- all who abode
<A NAME="131"></A><BR>Around Phoenice's towers, and by the crest
<A NAME="132"></A><BR>Of Massicytus, and Chimaera's glen.
<A NAME="133"></A><BR><BR>So man slew man in fight; but more than all
<A NAME="134"></A><BR>Eurypylus hurled doom on many a foe.
<A NAME="135"></A><BR>First slew he battle-bider Eurytus,
<A NAME="136"></A><BR>Menoetius of the glancing taslet next,
<A NAME="137"></A><BR>Elephenor's godlike comrades.  Fell with these
<A NAME="138"></A><BR>Harpalus, wise Odysseus' warrior-friend;
<A NAME="139"></A><BR>But in the fight afar that hero toiled,
<A NAME="140"></A><BR>And might not aid his fallen henchman: yet
<A NAME="141"></A><BR>Fierce Antiphus for that slain man was wroth,
<A NAME="142"></A><BR>And hurled his spear against Eurypylus,
<A NAME="143"></A><BR>Yet touched him not; the strong shaft glanced aside,
<A NAME="144"></A><BR>And pierced Meilanion battle-staunch, the son
<A NAME="145"></A><BR>Of Cleite lovely-faced, Erylaus' bride,
<A NAME="146"></A><BR>Who bare him where Caicus meets the sea.
<A NAME="147"></A><BR>Wroth for his comrade slain, Eurypylus
<A NAME="148"></A><BR>Rushed upon Antiphus, but terror-winged
<A NAME="149"></A><BR>He plunged amid his comrades; so the spear
<A NAME="150"></A><BR>Of the avenger slew him not, whose doom
<A NAME="151"></A><BR>Was one day wretchedly to be devoured
<A NAME="152"></A><BR>By the manslaying Cyclops: so it pleased
<A NAME="153"></A><BR>Stern Fate, I know not why.  Elsewhither sped
<A NAME="154"></A><BR>Eurypylus; and aye as he rushed on
<A NAME="155"></A><BR>Fell 'neath his spear a multitude untold.
<A NAME="156"></A><BR>As tall trees, smitten by the strength of steel
<A NAME="157"></A><BR>In mountain-forest, fill the dark ravines,
<A NAME="158"></A><BR>Heaped on the earth confusedly, so fell
<A NAME="159"></A><BR>The Achaeans 'neath Eurypylus' flying spears --
<A NAME="160"></A><BR>Till heart-uplifted met him face to face
<A NAME="161"></A><BR>Achilles' son.  The long spears in their hands
<A NAME="162"></A><BR>They twain swung up, each hot to smite his foe.
<A NAME="163"></A><BR>But first Eurypylus cried the challenge-cry;
<A NAME="164"></A><BR>"Who art thou?  Whence hast come to brave me here?
<A NAME="165"></A><BR>To Hades merciless Fate is bearing thee;
<A NAME="166"></A><BR>For in grim fight hath none escaped mine hands;
<A NAME="167"></A><BR>But whoso, eager for the fray, have come
<A NAME="168"></A><BR>Hither, on all have I hurled anguished death.
<A NAME="169"></A><BR>By Xanthus' streams have dogs devoured their flesh
<A NAME="170"></A><BR>And gnawed their bones.  Answer me, who art thou?
<A NAME="171"></A><BR>Whose be the steeds that bear thee exultant on?"
<A NAME="172"></A><BR><BR>Answered Achilles' battle-eager son:
<A NAME="173"></A><BR>"Wherefore, when I am hurrying to the fray,
<A NAME="174"></A><BR>Dost thou, a foe, put question thus to me,
<A NAME="175"></A><BR>As might a friend, touching my lineage,
<A NAME="176"></A><BR>Which many know?  Achilles' son am I,
<A NAME="177"></A><BR>Son of the man whose long spear smote thy sire,
<A NAME="178"></A><BR>And made him flee -- yea, and the ruthless fates
<A NAME="179"></A><BR>Of death had seized him, but my father's self
<A NAME="180"></A><BR>Healed him upon the brink of woeful death.
<A NAME="181"></A><BR>The steeds which bear me were my godlike sire's;
<A NAME="182"></A><BR>These the West-wind begat, the Harpy bare:
<A NAME="183"></A><BR>Over the barren sea their feet can race
<A NAME="184"></A><BR>Skimming its crests: in speed they match the winds.
<A NAME="185"></A><BR>Since then thou know'st the lineage of my steeds
<A NAME="186"></A><BR>And mine, now put thou to the test the might
<A NAME="187"></A><BR>Of my strong spear, born on steep Pelion's crest,
<A NAME="188"></A><BR>Who hath left his father-stock and forest there."
<A NAME="189"></A><BR><BR>He spake; and from the chariot sprang to earth
<A NAME="190"></A><BR>That glorious man: he swung the long spear up.
<A NAME="191"></A><BR>But in his brawny hand his foe hath seized
<A NAME="192"></A><BR>A monstrous stone: full at the golden shield
<A NAME="193"></A><BR>Of Neoptolemus he sped its flight;
<A NAME="194"></A><BR>But, no whir staggered by its whirlwind rush,
<A NAME="195"></A><BR>He like a giant mountain-foreland stood
<A NAME="196"></A><BR>Which all the banded fury of river-floods
<A NAME="197"></A><BR>Can stir not, rooted in the eternal hills;
<A NAME="198"></A><BR>So stood unshaken still Achilles' son.
<A NAME="199"></A><BR>Yet not for this Eurypylus' dauntless might
<A NAME="200"></A><BR>Shrank from Achilles' son invincible,
<A NAME="201"></A><BR>On-spurred by his own hardihood and by Fate.
<A NAME="202"></A><BR>Their hearts like caldrons seethed o'er fires of 
<A NAME="203"></A>wrath,
<A NAME="204"></A><BR>Their glancing armour flashed about their limbs.
<A NAME="205"></A><BR>Like terrible lions each on other rushed,
<A NAME="206"></A><BR>Which fight amid the mountains famine-stung,
<A NAME="207"></A><BR>Writhing and leaping in the strain of strife
<A NAME="208"></A><BR>For a slain ox or stag, while all the glens
<A NAME="209"></A><BR>Ring with their conflict; so they grappled, so
<A NAME="210"></A><BR>Clashed they in pitiless strife.  On either hand
<A NAME="211"></A><BR>Long lines of warriors Greek and Trojan toiled
<A NAME="212"></A><BR>In combat: round them roared up flames of war.
<A NAME="213"></A><BR>Like mighty rushing winds they hurled together
<A NAME="214"></A><BR>With eager spears for blood of life athirst.
<A NAME="215"></A><BR>Hard by them stood Enyo, spurred them on
<A NAME="216"></A><BR>Ceaselessly: never paused they from the strife.
<A NAME="217"></A><BR>Now hewed they each the other's shield, and now
<A NAME="218"></A><BR>Thrust at the greaves, now at the crested helms.
<A NAME="219"></A><BR>Reckless of wounds, in that grim toil pressed on
<A NAME="220"></A><BR>Those aweless heroes: Strife incarnate watched
<A NAME="221"></A><BR>And gloated o'er them.  Ran the sweat in streams
<A NAME="222"></A><BR>From either: straining hard they stood their ground,
<A NAME="223"></A><BR>For both were of the seed of Blessed Ones.
<A NAME="224"></A><BR>From Heaven, with hearts at variance, Gods looked 
<A NAME="225"></A>down;
<A NAME="226"></A><BR>For some gave glory to Achilles' son,
<A NAME="227"></A><BR>Some to Eurypylus the godlike.  Still
<A NAME="228"></A><BR>They fought on, giving ground no more than rock.
<A NAME="229"></A><BR>Of granite mountains.  Rang from side to side
<A NAME="230"></A><BR>Spear-smitten shields.  At last the Pelian lance,
<A NAME="231"></A><BR>Sped onward by a mighty thrust, hath passed
<A NAME="232"></A><BR>Clear through Eurypylus' throat.  Forth poured the 
<A NAME="233"></A>blood
<A NAME="234"></A><BR>Torrent-like; through the portal of the wound
<A NAME="235"></A><BR>The soul from the body flew: darkness of death
<A NAME="236"></A><BR>Dropped o'er his eyes.  To earth in clanging arms
<A NAME="237"></A><BR>He fell, like stately pine or silver fir
<A NAME="238"></A><BR>Uprooted by the fury of Boreas;
<A NAME="239"></A><BR>Such space of earth Eurypylus' giant frame
<A NAME="240"></A><BR>Covered in falling: rang again the floor
<A NAME="241"></A><BR>And plain of Troyland.  Grey death-pallor swept
<A NAME="242"></A><BR>Over the corpse, and all the flush of life
<A NAME="243"></A><BR>Faded away.  With a triumphant laugh
<A NAME="244"></A><BR>Shouted the mighty hero over him:
<A NAME="245"></A><BR>"Eurypylus, thou saidst thou wouldst destroy
<A NAME="246"></A><BR>The Danaan ships and men, wouldst slay us all
<A NAME="247"></A><BR>Wretchedly -- but the Gods would not fulfil
<A NAME="248"></A><BR>Thy wish.  For all thy might invincible,
<A NAME="249"></A><BR>My father's massy spear hath now subdued
<A NAME="250"></A><BR>Thee under me, that spear no man shall 'scape,
<A NAME="251"></A><BR>Though he be brass all through, who faceth me."
<A NAME="252"></A><BR><BR>He spake, and tore the long lance from the corse,
<A NAME="253"></A><BR>While shrank the Trojans back in dread, at sight
<A NAME="254"></A><BR>Of that strong-hearted man.  Straightway he stripped
<A NAME="255"></A><BR>The armour from the dead, for friends to bear
<A NAME="256"></A><BR>Fast to the ships Achaean.  But himself
<A NAME="257"></A><BR>To the swift chariot and the tireless steeds
<A NAME="258"></A><BR>Sprang, and sped onward like a thunderbolt
<A NAME="259"></A><BR>That lightning-girdled leaps through the wide air
<A NAME="260"></A><BR>From Zeus's hands unconquerable -- the bolt
<A NAME="261"></A><BR>Before whose downrush all the Immortals quail
<A NAME="262"></A><BR>Save only Zeus.  It rusheth down to earth,
<A NAME="263"></A><BR>It rendeth trees and rugged mountain-crags;
<A NAME="264"></A><BR>So rushed he on the Trojans, flashing doom
<A NAME="265"></A><BR>Before their eyes; dashed to the earth they fell
<A NAME="266"></A><BR>Before the charge of those immortal steeds:
<A NAME="267"></A><BR>The earth was heaped with slain, was dyed with gore.
<A NAME="268"></A><BR>As when in mountain-glens the unnumbered leaves
<A NAME="269"></A><BR>Down-streaming thick and fast hide all the ground,
<A NAME="270"></A><BR>So hosts of Troy untold on earth were strewn
<A NAME="271"></A><BR>By Neoptolemus and fierce-hearted Greeks,
<A NAME="272"></A><BR>Shed by whose hands the blood in torrents ran
<A NAME="273"></A><BR>'Neath feet of men and horses.  Chariot-rails
<A NAME="274"></A><BR>Were dashed with blood-spray whirled up from the 
<A NAME="275"></A>tyres.
<A NAME="276"></A><BR><BR>Now had the Trojans fled within their gates
<A NAME="277"></A><BR>As calves that flee a lion, or as swine
<A NAME="278"></A><BR>Flee from a storm -- but murderous Ares came,
<A NAME="279"></A><BR>Unmarked of other Gods, down from the heavens,
<A NAME="280"></A><BR>Eager to help the warrior sons of Troy.
<A NAME="281"></A><BR>Red-fire and Flame, Tumult and Panic-fear,
<A NAME="282"></A><BR>His car-steeds, bare him down into the fight,
<A NAME="283"></A><BR>The coursers which to roaring Boreas
<A NAME="284"></A><BR>Grim-eyed Erinnys bare, coursers that breathed
<A NAME="285"></A><BR>Life-blasting flame: groaned all the shivering air,
<A NAME="286"></A><BR>As battleward they sped.  Swiftly he came
<A NAME="287"></A><BR>To Troy: loud rang the earth beneath the feet
<A NAME="288"></A><BR>Of that wild team.  Into the battle's heart
<A NAME="289"></A><BR>Tossing his massy spear, he came; with a shout
<A NAME="290"></A><BR>He cheered the Trojans on to face the foe.
<A NAME="291"></A><BR>They heard, and marvelled at that wondrous cry,
<A NAME="292"></A><BR>Not seeing the God's immortal form, nor steeds,
<A NAME="293"></A><BR>Veiled in dense mist.  But the wise prophet-soul
<A NAME="294"></A><BR>Of Helenus knew the voice divine that leapt
<A NAME="295"></A><BR>Unto the Trojans' ears, they knew not whence,
<A NAME="296"></A><BR>And with glad heart to the fleeing host he cried:
<A NAME="297"></A><BR>"O cravens, wherefore fear Achilles' son,
<A NAME="298"></A><BR>Though ne'er so brave?  He is mortal even as we;
<A NAME="299"></A><BR>His strength is not as Ares' strength, who is come
<A NAME="300"></A><BR>A very present help in our sore need.
<A NAME="301"></A><BR>That was his shout far-pealing, bidding us
<A NAME="302"></A><BR>Fight on against the Argives.  Let your hearts
<A NAME="303"></A><BR>Be strong, O friends: let courage fill your breasts.
<A NAME="304"></A><BR>No mightier battle-helper can draw nigh
<A NAME="305"></A><BR>To Troy than he.  Who is of more avail
<A NAME="306"></A><BR>For war than Ares, when he aideth men
<A NAME="307"></A><BR>Hard-fighting?  Lo, to our help he cometh now!
<A NAME="308"></A><BR>On to the fight!  Cast to the winds your fears!"
<A NAME="309"></A><BR><BR>They fled no more, they faced the Argive men,
<A NAME="310"></A><BR>As hounds, that mid the copses fled at first,
<A NAME="311"></A><BR>Turn them about to face and fight the wolf,
<A NAME="312"></A><BR>Spurred by the chiding of their shepherd-lord;
<A NAME="313"></A><BR>So turned the sons of Troy again to war,
<A NAME="314"></A><BR>Casting away their fear.  Man leapt on man
<A NAME="315"></A><BR>Valiantly fighting; loud their armour clashed
<A NAME="316"></A><BR>Smitten with swords, with lances, and with darts.
<A NAME="317"></A><BR>Spears plunged into men's flesh: dread Ares drank
<A NAME="318"></A><BR>His fill of blood: struck down fell man on man,
<A NAME="319"></A><BR>As Greek and Trojan fought.  In level poise
<A NAME="320"></A><BR>The battle-balance hung.  As when young men
<A NAME="321"></A><BR>In hot haste prune a vineyard with the steel,
<A NAME="322"></A><BR>And each keeps pace with each in rivalry,
<A NAME="323"></A><BR>Since all in strength and age be equal-matched;
<A NAME="324"></A><BR>So did the awful scales of battle hang
<A NAME="325"></A><BR>Level: all Trojan hearts beat high, and firm
<A NAME="326"></A><BR>Stood they in trust on aweless Ares' might,
<A NAME="327"></A><BR>While the Greeks trusted in Achilles' son.
<A NAME="328"></A><BR>Ever they slew and slew: stalked through the midst
<A NAME="329"></A><BR>Deadly Enyo, her shoulders and her hands
<A NAME="330"></A><BR>Blood-splashed, while fearful sweat streamed from her 
<A NAME="331"></A>limbs.
<A NAME="332"></A><BR>Revelling in equal fight, she aided none,
<A NAME="333"></A><BR>Lest Thetis' or the War-god's wrath be stirred.
<A NAME="334"></A><BR><BR>Then Neoptolemus slew one far-renowned,
<A NAME="335"></A><BR>Perimedes, who had dwelt by Smintheus' grove;
<A NAME="336"></A><BR>Next Cestrus died, Phalerus battle-staunch,
<A NAME="337"></A><BR>Perilaus the strong, Menalcas lord of spears,
<A NAME="338"></A><BR>Whom Iphianassa bare by the haunted foot
<A NAME="339"></A><BR>Of Cilla to the cunning craftsman Medon.
<A NAME="340"></A><BR>In the home-land afar the sire abode,
<A NAME="341"></A><BR>And never kissed his son's returning head:
<A NAME="342"></A><BR>For that fair home and all his cunning works
<A NAME="343"></A><BR>Did far-off kinsmen wrangle o'er his grave.
<A NAME="344"></A><BR>Deiphobus slew Lycon battle-staunch:
<A NAME="345"></A><BR>The lance-head pierced him close above the groin,
<A NAME="346"></A><BR>And round the long spear all his bowels gushed out.
<A NAME="347"></A><BR>Aeneas smote down Dymas, who erewhile
<A NAME="348"></A><BR>In Aulis dwelt, and followed unto Troy
<A NAME="349"></A><BR>Arcesilaus, and saw never more
<A NAME="350"></A><BR>The dear home-land.  Euryalus hurled a dart,
<A NAME="351"></A><BR>And through Astraeus' breast the death-winged point
<A NAME="352"></A><BR>Flew, shearing through the breathways of man's life;
<A NAME="353"></A><BR>And all that lay within was drenched with blood.
<A NAME="354"></A><BR>And hard thereby great-souled Agenor slew
<A NAME="355"></A><BR>Hippomenes, hero Teucer's comrade staunch,
<A NAME="356"></A><BR>With one swift thrust 'twixt shoulder and neck: his 
<A NAME="357"></A>soul
<A NAME="358"></A><BR>Rushed forth in blood; death's night swept over 
<A NAME="359"></A>him.
<A NAME="360"></A><BR>Grief for his comrade slain on Teucer fell;
<A NAME="361"></A><BR>He strained his bow, a swift-winged shaft he sped,
<A NAME="362"></A><BR>But smote him not, for slightly Agenor swerved.
<A NAME="363"></A><BR>Yet nigh him Deiophontes stood; the shaft
<A NAME="364"></A><BR>Into his left eye plunged, passed through the ball,
<A NAME="365"></A><BR>And out through his right ear, because the Fates
<A NAME="366"></A><BR>Whither they willed thrust on the bitter barbs.
<A NAME="367"></A><BR>Even as in agony he leapt full height,
<A NAME="368"></A><BR>Yet once again the archer's arrow hissed:
<A NAME="369"></A><BR>It pierced his throat, through the neck-sinews cleft
<A NAME="370"></A><BR>Unswerving, and his hard doom came on him.
<A NAME="371"></A><BR><BR>So man to man dealt death; and joyed the Fates
<A NAME="372"></A><BR>And Doom, and fell Strife in her maddened glee
<A NAME="373"></A><BR>Shouted aloud, and Ares terribly
<A NAME="374"></A><BR>Shouted in answer, and with courage thrilled
<A NAME="375"></A><BR>The Trojans, and with panic fear the Greeks,
<A NAME="376"></A><BR>And shook their reeling squadrons.  But one man
<A NAME="377"></A><BR>He scared not, even Achilles' son; he abode,
<A NAME="378"></A><BR>And fought undaunted, slaying foes on foes.
<A NAME="379"></A><BR>As when a young lad sweeps his hand around
<A NAME="380"></A><BR>Flies swarming over milk, and nigh the bowl
<A NAME="381"></A><BR>Here, there they lie, struck dead by that light 
<A NAME="382"></A>touch,
<A NAME="383"></A><BR>And gleefully the child still plies the work;
<A NAME="384"></A><BR>So stern Achilles' glorious scion joyed
<A NAME="385"></A><BR>Over the slain, and recked not of the God
<A NAME="386"></A><BR>Who spurred the Trojans on: man after man
<A NAME="387"></A><BR>Tasted his vengeance of their charging host.
<A NAME="388"></A><BR>Even as a giant mountain-peak withstands
<A NAME="389"></A><BR>On-rushing hurricane-blasts, so he abode
<A NAME="390"></A><BR>Unquailing.  Ares at his eager mood
<A NAME="391"></A><BR>Grew wroth, and would have cast his veil of cloud
<A NAME="392"></A><BR>Away, and met him face to face in fight,
<A NAME="393"></A><BR>But now Athena from Olympus swooped
<A NAME="394"></A><BR>To forest-mantled Ida.  Quaked the earth
<A NAME="395"></A><BR>And Xanthus' murmuring streams; so mightily
<A NAME="396"></A><BR>She shook them: terror-stricken were the souls
<A NAME="397"></A><BR>Of all the Nymphs, adread for Priam's town.
<A NAME="398"></A><BR>From her immortal armour flashed around
<A NAME="399"></A><BR>The hovering lightnings; fearful serpents breathed
<A NAME="400"></A><BR>Fire from her shield invincible; the crest
<A NAME="401"></A><BR>Of her great helmet swept the clouds.  And now
<A NAME="402"></A><BR>She was at point to close in sudden fight
<A NAME="403"></A><BR>With Ares; but the mighty will of Zeus
<A NAME="404"></A><BR>Daunted them both, from high heaven thundering
<A NAME="405"></A><BR>His terrors.  Ares drew back from the war,
<A NAME="406"></A><BR>For manifest to him was Zeus's wrath.
<A NAME="407"></A><BR>To wintry Thrace he passed; his haughty heart
<A NAME="408"></A><BR>Reeked no more of the Trojans.  In the plain
<A NAME="409"></A><BR>Of Troy no more stayed Pallas; she was gone
<A NAME="410"></A><BR>To hallowed Athens.  But the armies still
<A NAME="411"></A><BR>Strove in the deadly fray; and fainted now
<A NAME="412"></A><BR>The Trojans' prowess; but all battle-fain
<A NAME="413"></A><BR>The Argives pressed on these as they gave ground.
<A NAME="414"></A><BR>As winds chase ships that fly with straining sails
<A NAME="415"></A><BR>On to the outsea -- as on forest-brakes
<A NAME="416"></A><BR>Leapeth the fury of flame -- as swift hounds drive
<A NAME="417"></A><BR>Deer through the mountains, eager for the prey,
<A NAME="418"></A><BR>So did the Argives chase them: Achilles' son
<A NAME="419"></A><BR>Still cheered them on, still slew with that great 
<A NAME="420"></A>spear
<A NAME="421"></A><BR>Whomso he overtook.  On, on they fled
<A NAME="422"></A><BR>Till into stately-gated Troy they poured.
<A NAME="423"></A><BR><BR>Then had the Argives a short breathing-space
<A NAME="424"></A><BR>From war, when they had penned the hosts of Troy
<A NAME="425"></A><BR>In Priam's burg, as shepherds pen up lambs
<A NAME="426"></A><BR>Upon a lonely steading.  And, as when
<A NAME="427"></A><BR>After hard strain, a breathing-space is given
<A NAME="428"></A><BR>To oxen that, quick-panting 'neath the yoke,
<A NAME="429"></A><BR>Up a steep hill have dragged a load, so breathed
<A NAME="430"></A><BR>Awhile the Achaeans after toil in arms.
<A NAME="431"></A><BR>Then once more hot for the fray did they beset
<A NAME="432"></A><BR>The city-towers.  But now with gates fast barred
<A NAME="433"></A><BR>The Trojans from the walls withstood the assault.
<A NAME="434"></A><BR>As when within their steading shepherd-folk
<A NAME="435"></A><BR>Abide the lowering tempest, when a day
<A NAME="436"></A><BR>Of storm hath dawned, with fury of lightnings, rain
<A NAME="437"></A><BR>And heavy-drifting snow, and dare not haste
<A NAME="438"></A><BR>Forth to the pasture, howsoever fain,
<A NAME="439"></A><BR>Till the great storm abate, and rivers, wide
<A NAME="440"></A><BR>With rushing floods, again be passable;
<A NAME="441"></A><BR>So trembling on their walls they abode the rage
<A NAME="442"></A><BR>Of foes against their ramparts surging fast.
<A NAME="443"></A><BR>And as when daws or starlings drop in clouds
<A NAME="444"></A><BR>Down on an orchard-close, full fain to feast
<A NAME="445"></A><BR>Upon its pleasant fruits, and take no heed
<A NAME="446"></A><BR>Of men that shout to scare them thence away,
<A NAME="447"></A><BR>Until the reckless hunger be appeased
<A NAME="448"></A><BR>That makes them bold; so poured round Priam's burg
<A NAME="449"></A><BR>The furious Danaans.  Against the gates
<A NAME="450"></A><BR>They hurled themselves, they strove to batter down
<A NAME="451"></A><BR>The mighty-souled Earth-shaker's work divine.
<A NAME="452"></A><BR><BR>Yet did tim Troyfolk not, despite their fear,
<A NAME="453"></A><BR>Flinch from the fight: they manned their towers, they 
<A NAME="454"></A>toiled
<A NAME="455"></A><BR>Unresting: ever from the fair-built walls
<A NAME="456"></A><BR>Leapt arrows, stones, and fleet-winged javelins 
<A NAME="457"></A>down
<A NAME="458"></A><BR>Amidst the thronging foes; for Phoebus thrilled
<A NAME="459"></A><BR>Their souls with steadfast hardihood.  Fain was 
<A NAME="460"></A>he
<A NAME="461"></A><BR>To save them still, though Hector was no more.
<A NAME="462"></A><BR><BR>Then Meriones shot forth a deadly shaft,
<A NAME="463"></A><BR>And smote Phylodamas, Polites' friend,
<A NAME="464"></A><BR>Beneath the jaw; the arrow pierced his throat.
<A NAME="465"></A><BR>Down fell he like a vulture, from a rock
<A NAME="466"></A><BR>By fowler's barbed arrow shot and slain;
<A NAME="467"></A><BR>So from the high tower swiftly down he fell:
<A NAME="468"></A><BR>His life fled; clanged his armour o'er the corpse.
<A NAME="469"></A><BR>With laughter of triumph stalwart Molus' son
<A NAME="470"></A><BR>A second arrow sped, with strong desire
<A NAME="471"></A><BR>To smite Polites, ill-starred Priam's son:
<A NAME="472"></A><BR>But with a swift side-swerve did he escape
<A NAME="473"></A><BR>The death, nor did the arrow touch his flesh.
<A NAME="474"></A><BR>As when a shipman, as his bark flies on
<A NAME="475"></A><BR>O'er sea-gulfs, spies amid the rushing tide
<A NAME="476"></A><BR>A rock, and to escape it swiftly puts
<A NAME="477"></A><BR>The helm about, and turns aside the ship
<A NAME="478"></A><BR>Even as he listeth, that a little strength
<A NAME="479"></A><BR>Averts a great disaster; so did he
<A NAME="480"></A><BR>Foresee and shun the deadly shaft of doom.
<A NAME="481"></A><BR><BR>Ever they fought on; walls, towers, battlements
<A NAME="482"></A><BR>Were blood-besprent, wherever Trojans fell
<A NAME="483"></A><BR>Slain by the arrows of the stalwart Greeks.
<A NAME="484"></A><BR>Yet these escaped not scatheless; many of them
<A NAME="485"></A><BR>Dyed the earth red: aye waxed the havoc of death
<A NAME="486"></A><BR>As friends and foes were stricken.  O'er the strife
<A NAME="487"></A><BR>Shouted for glee Enyo, sister of War.
<A NAME="488"></A><BR><BR>Now had the Argives burst the gates, had breached
<A NAME="489"></A><BR>The walls of Troy, for boundless was their might;
<A NAME="490"></A><BR>But Ganymedes saw from heaven, and cried,
<A NAME="491"></A><BR>Anguished with fear for his own fatherland:
<A NAME="492"></A><BR>"O Father Zeus, if of thy seed I am,
<A NAME="493"></A><BR>If at thine best I left far-famous Troy
<A NAME="494"></A><BR>For immortality with deathless Gods,
<A NAME="495"></A><BR>O hear me now, whose soul is anguish-thrilled!
<A NAME="496"></A><BR>I cannot bear to see my fathers' town
<A NAME="497"></A><BR>In flames, my kindred in disastrous strife \u00fa
<A NAME="498"></A><BR>Perishing: bitterer sorrow is there none!
<A NAME="499"></A><BR>Oh, if thine heart is fixed to do this thing,
<A NAME="500"></A><BR>Let me be far hence!  Less shall be my grief
<A NAME="501"></A><BR>If I behold it not with these mine eyes.
<A NAME="502"></A><BR>That is the depth of horror and of shame
<A NAME="503"></A><BR>To see one's country wrecked by hands of foes."
<A NAME="504"></A><BR><BR>With groans and tears so pleaded Ganymede.
<A NAME="505"></A><BR>Then Zeus himself with one vast pall of cloud
<A NAME="506"></A><BR>Veiled all the city of Priam world-renowned;
<A NAME="507"></A><BR>And all the murderous fight was drowned in mist,
<A NAME="508"></A><BR>And like a vanished phantom was the wall
<A NAME="509"></A><BR>In vapours heavy-hung no eye could pierce;
<A NAME="510"></A><BR>And all around crashed thunders, lightnings flamed
<A NAME="511"></A><BR>From heaven.  The Danaans heard Zeus' clarion peal
<A NAME="512"></A><BR>Awe-struck; and Neleus' son cried unto them:
<A NAME="513"></A><BR>"Far-famous lords of Argives, all our strength
<A NAME="514"></A><BR>Palsied shall be, while Zeus protecteth thus
<A NAME="515"></A><BR>Our foes.  A great tide of calamity
<A NAME="516"></A><BR>On us is rolling; haste we then to the ships;
<A NAME="517"></A><BR>Cease we awhile from bitter toil of strife,
<A NAME="518"></A><BR>Lest the fire of his wrath consume us all.
<A NAME="519"></A><BR>Submit we to his portents; needs must all
<A NAME="520"></A><BR>Obey him ever, who is mightier far
<A NAME="521"></A><BR>Than all strong Gods, all weakling sons of men.
<A NAME="522"></A><BR>On the presumptuous Titans once in wrath
<A NAME="523"></A><BR>He poured down fire from heaven: then burned all 
<A NAME="524"></A>earth
<A NAME="525"></A><BR>Beneath, and Ocean's world-engirdling flood
<A NAME="526"></A><BR>Boiled from its depths, yea, to its utmost bounds:
<A NAME="527"></A><BR>Far-flowing mighty rivers were dried up:
<A NAME="528"></A><BR>Perished all broods of life-sustaining earth,
<A NAME="529"></A><BR>All fosterlings of the boundless sea, and all
<A NAME="530"></A><BR>Dwellers in rivers: smoke and ashes veiled
<A NAME="531"></A><BR>The air: earth fainted in the fervent heat.
<A NAME="532"></A><BR>Therefore this day I dread the might of Zeus.
<A NAME="533"></A><BR>Now, pass we to the ships, since for to-day
<A NAME="534"></A><BR>He helpeth Troy.  To us too shall he grant
<A NAME="535"></A><BR>Glory hereafter; for the dawn on men,
<A NAME="536"></A><BR>Though whiles it frown, anon shall smile.  Not yet,
<A NAME="537"></A><BR>But soon, shall Fate lead us to smite yon town,
<A NAME="538"></A><BR>If true indeed was Calchas' prophecy
<A NAME="539"></A><BR>Spoken aforetime to the assembled Greeks,
<A NAME="540"></A><BR>That in the tenth year Priam's burg should fall."
<A NAME="541"></A><BR><BR>Then left they that far-famous town, and turned
<A NAME="542"></A><BR>From war, in awe of Zeus's threatenings,
<A NAME="543"></A><BR>Hearkening to one with ancient wisdom wise.
<A NAME="544"></A><BR>Yet they forgat not friends in battle slain,
<A NAME="545"></A><BR>But bare them from the field and buried them.
<A NAME="546"></A><BR>These the mist hid not, but the town alone
<A NAME="547"></A><BR>And its unscaleable wall, around which fell
<A NAME="548"></A><BR>Trojans and Argives many in battle slain.
<A NAME="549"></A><BR>So came they to the ships, and put from them
<A NAME="550"></A><BR>Their battle-gear, and strode into the waves
<A NAME="551"></A><BR>Of Hellespont fair-flowing, and washed away
<A NAME="552"></A><BR>All stain of dust and sweat and clotted gore.
<A NAME="553"></A><BR><BR>The sun drave down his never-wearying steeds
<A NAME="554"></A><BR>Into the dark west: night streamed o'er the earth,
<A NAME="555"></A><BR>Bidding men cease from toil.  The Argives then
<A NAME="556"></A><BR>Acclaimed Achilles' valiant son with praise
<A NAME="557"></A><BR>High as his father's.  Mid triumphant mirth
<A NAME="558"></A><BR>He feasted in kings' tents: no battle-toil
<A NAME="559"></A><BR>Had wearied him; for Thetis from his limbs
<A NAME="560"></A><BR>Had charmed all ache of travail, making him
<A NAME="561"></A><BR>As one whom labour had no power to tire.
<A NAME="562"></A><BR>When his strong heart was satisfied with meat,
<A NAME="563"></A><BR>He passed to his father's tent, and over him
<A NAME="564"></A><BR>Sleep's dews were poured.  The Greeks slept in the 
<A NAME="565"></A>plain
<A NAME="566"></A><BR>Before the ships, by ever-changing guards
<A NAME="567"></A><BR>Watched; for they dreaded lest the host of Troy,
<A NAME="568"></A><BR>Or of her staunch allies, should kindle flame
<A NAME="569"></A><BR>Upon the ships, and from them all cut off
<A NAME="570"></A><BR>Their home-return.  In Priam's burg the while
<A NAME="571"></A><BR>By gate and wall men watched and slept in turn,
<A NAME="572"></A><BR>Adread to hear the Argives' onset-shout.
