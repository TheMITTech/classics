<A NAME="10"></A><B>How from His Long Lone Exile Returned To the War 
<A NAME="11"></A>Philoctetes</B>
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="12"></A>When ended was night's darkness, and the Dawn
<A NAME="13"></A><BR>Rose from the world's verge, and the wide air glowed
<A NAME="14"></A><BR>With splendour, then did Argos' warrior-sons
<A NAME="15"></A><BR>Gaze o'er the plain; and lo, all cloudless-clear
<A NAME="16"></A><BR>Stood Ilium's towers.  The marvel of yesterday
<A NAME="17"></A><BR>Seemed a strange dream.  No thought the Trojans 
<A NAME="18"></A>had
<A NAME="19"></A><BR>Of standing forth to fight without the wall.
<A NAME="20"></A><BR>A great fear held them thralls, the awful thought
<A NAME="21"></A><BR>That yet alive was Peleus' glorious son.
<A NAME="22"></A><BR>But to the King of Heaven Antenor cried:
<A NAME="23"></A><BR>"Zeus, Lord of Ida and the starry sky,
<A NAME="24"></A><BR>Hearken my prayer!  Oh turn back from our town
<A NAME="25"></A><BR>That battle-eager murderous-hearted man,
<A NAME="26"></A><BR>Be he Achilles who hath not passed down
<A NAME="27"></A><BR>To Hades, or some other like to him.
<A NAME="28"></A><BR>For now in heaven-descended Priam's burg
<A NAME="29"></A><BR>By thousands are her people perishing:
<A NAME="30"></A><BR>No respite cometh from calamity:
<A NAME="31"></A><BR>Murder and havoc evermore increase.
<A NAME="32"></A><BR>O Father Zeus, thou carest not though we
<A NAME="33"></A><BR>Be slaughtered of our foes: thou helpest them,
<A NAME="34"></A><BR>Forgetting thy son, godlike Dardanus!
<A NAME="35"></A><BR>But, if this be the purpose of thine heart
<A NAME="36"></A><BR>That Argives shall destroy us wretchedly,
<A NAME="37"></A><BR>Now do it: draw not out our agony!"
<A NAME="38"></A><BR><BR>In passionate prayer he cried; and Zeus from 
<A NAME="39"></A>heaven
<A NAME="40"></A><BR>Hearkened, and hasted on the end of all,
<A NAME="41"></A><BR>Which else he had delayed.  He granted him
<A NAME="42"></A><BR>This awful boon, that myriads of Troy's sons
<A NAME="43"></A><BR>Should with their children perish: but that prayer
<A NAME="44"></A><BR>He granted not, to turn Achilles' son
<A NAME="45"></A><BR>Back from the wide-wayed town; nay, all the more
<A NAME="46"></A><BR>He enkindled him to war, for he would now
<A NAME="47"></A><BR>Give grace and glory to the Nereid Queen.
<A NAME="48"></A><BR><BR>So purposed he, of all Gods mightiest.
<A NAME="49"></A><BR>But now between the city and Hellespont
<A NAME="50"></A><BR>Were Greeks and Trojans burning men and steeds
<A NAME="51"></A><BR>In battle slain, while paused the murderous strife.
<A NAME="52"></A><BR>For Priam sent his herald Menoetes forth
<A NAME="53"></A><BR>To Agamemnon and the Achaean chiefs,
<A NAME="54"></A><BR>Asking a truce wherein to burn the dead;
<A NAME="55"></A><BR>And they, of reverence for the slain, gave ear;
<A NAME="56"></A><BR>For wrath pursueth not the dead.  And when
<A NAME="57"></A><BR>They had lain their slain on those close-thronging 
<A NAME="58"></A>pyres,
<A NAME="59"></A><BR>Then did the Argives to their tents return,
<A NAME="60"></A><BR>And unto Priam's gold-abounding halls
<A NAME="61"></A><BR>The Trojans, for Eurypylus sorrowing sore:
<A NAME="62"></A><BR>For even as Priam's sons they honoured him.
<A NAME="63"></A><BR>Therefore apart from all the other slain,
<A NAME="64"></A><BR>Before the Gate Dardanian -- where the streams
<A NAME="65"></A><BR>Of eddying Xanthus down from Ida flow
<A NAME="66"></A><BR>Fed by the rains of heavens -- they buried him.
<A NAME="67"></A><BR><BR>Aweless Achilles' son the while went forth
<A NAME="68"></A><BR>To his sire's huge tomb.  Outpouring tears, he kissed
<A NAME="69"></A><BR>The tall memorial pillar of the dead,
<A NAME="70"></A><BR>And groaning clasped it round, and thus he cried:
<A NAME="71"></A><BR>"Hail, father!  Though beneath the earth thou lie
<A NAME="72"></A><BR>In Hades' halls, I shall forget thee not.
<A NAME="73"></A><BR>Oh to have met thee living mid the host!
<A NAME="74"></A><BR>Then of each other had our souls had joy,
<A NAME="75"></A><BR>Then of her wealth had we spoiled Ilium.
<A NAME="76"></A><BR>But now, thou hast not seen thy child, nor I
<A NAME="77"></A><BR>Seen thee, who yearned to look on thee in life.
<A NAME="78"></A><BR>Yet, though thou be afar amidst the dead,
<A NAME="79"></A><BR>Thy spear, thy son, have made thy foes to quail;
<A NAME="80"></A><BR>And Danaans with exceeding joy behold
<A NAME="81"></A><BR>One like to thee in stature, fame and deeds."
<A NAME="82"></A><BR><BR>He spake, and wiped the hot tears from his face;
<A NAME="83"></A><BR>And to his father's ships passed swiftly thence:
<A NAME="84"></A><BR>With him went Myrmidon warriors two and ten,
<A NAME="85"></A><BR>And white-haired Phoenix followed on with these
<A NAME="86"></A><BR>Woefully sighing for the glorious dead.
<A NAME="87"></A><BR><BR>Night rose o'er earth, the stars flashed out in 
<A NAME="88"></A>heaven;
<A NAME="89"></A><BR>So these brake bread, and slept till woke the Dawn.
<A NAME="90"></A><BR>Then the Greeks donned their armour: flashed afar
<A NAME="91"></A><BR>Its splendour up to the very firmament.
<A NAME="92"></A><BR>Forth of their gates in one great throng they poured,
<A NAME="93"></A><BR>Like snowflakes thick and fast, which drift adown
<A NAME="94"></A><BR>Heavily from the clouds in winter's cold;
<A NAME="95"></A><BR>So streamed they forth before the wall, and rose
<A NAME="96"></A><BR>Their dread shout: groaned the deep earth 'neath their 
<A NAME="97"></A>tramp.
<A NAME="98"></A><BR><BR>The Trojans heard that shout, and saw that host,
<A NAME="99"></A><BR>And marvelled.  Crushed with fear were all their 
<A NAME="100"></A>hearts
<A NAME="101"></A><BR>Foreboding doom; for like a huge cloud seemed
<A NAME="102"></A><BR>That throng of foes: with clashing arms they came:
<A NAME="103"></A><BR>Volumed and vast the dust rose 'neath their feet.
<A NAME="104"></A><BR>Then either did some God with hardihood thrill
<A NAME="105"></A><BR>Deiphobus' heart, and made it void of fear,
<A NAME="106"></A><BR>Or his own spirit spurred him on to fight,
<A NAME="107"></A><BR>To drive by thrust of spear that terrible host
<A NAME="108"></A><BR>Of foemen from the city of his birth.
<A NAME="109"></A><BR>So there in Troy he cried with heartening speech:
<A NAME="110"></A><BR>"O friends, be stout of heart to play the men!
<A NAME="111"></A><BR>Remember all the agonies that war
<A NAME="112"></A><BR>Brings in the end to them that yield to foes.
<A NAME="113"></A><BR>Ye wrestle not for Alexander alone,
<A NAME="114"></A><BR>Nor Helen, but for home, for your own lives,
<A NAME="115"></A><BR>For wives, for little ones, for parents grey,
<A NAME="116"></A><BR>For all the grace of life, for all ye have,
<A NAME="117"></A><BR>For this dear land -- oh may she shroud me o'er
<A NAME="118"></A><BR>Slain in the battle, ere I see her lie
<A NAME="119"></A><BR>'Neath foemen's spears -- my country!  I know not
<A NAME="120"></A><BR>A bitterer pang than this for hapless men!
<A NAME="121"></A><BR>O be ye strong for battle!  Forth to the fight
<A NAME="122"></A><BR>With me, and thrust this horror far away!
<A NAME="123"></A><BR>Think not Achilles liveth still to war
<A NAME="124"></A><BR>Against us: him the ravening fire consumed.
<A NAME="125"></A><BR>Some other Achaean was it who so late
<A NAME="126"></A><BR>Enkindled them to war.  Oh, shame it were
<A NAME="127"></A><BR>If men who fight for fatherland should fear
<A NAME="128"></A><BR>Achilles' self, or any Greek beside!
<A NAME="129"></A><BR>Let us not flinch from war-toil!  have we not
<A NAME="130"></A><BR>Endured much battle-travail heretofore?
<A NAME="131"></A><BR>What, know ye not that to men sorely tried
<A NAME="132"></A><BR>Prosperity and joyance follow toil?
<A NAME="133"></A><BR>So after scourging winds and ruining storms
<A NAME="134"></A><BR>Zeus brings to men a morn of balmy air;
<A NAME="135"></A><BR>After disease new strength comes, after war
<A NAME="136"></A><BR>Peace: all things know Time's changeless law of 
<A NAME="137"></A>change."
<A NAME="138"></A><BR><BR>Then eager all for war they armed themselves
<A NAME="139"></A><BR>In haste.  All through the town rang clangour of 
<A NAME="140"></A>arms
<A NAME="141"></A><BR>As for grim fight strong men arrayed their limbs.
<A NAME="142"></A><BR>Here stood a wife, shuddering with dread of war,
<A NAME="143"></A><BR>Yet piling, as she wept, her husband's arms
<A NAME="144"></A><BR>Before his feet.  There little children brought
<A NAME="145"></A><BR>To a father his war-gear with eager haste;
<A NAME="146"></A><BR>And now his heart was wrung to hear their sobs,
<A NAME="147"></A><BR>And now he smiled on those small ministers,
<A NAME="148"></A><BR>And stronger waxed his heart's resolve to fight
<A NAME="149"></A><BR>To the last gasp for these, the near and dear.
<A NAME="150"></A><BR>Yonder again, with hands that had not lost
<A NAME="151"></A><BR>Old cunning, a grey father for the fray
<A NAME="152"></A><BR>Girded a son, and murmured once and again:
<A NAME="153"></A><BR>"Dear boy, yield thou to no man in the war!"
<A NAME="154"></A><BR>And showed his son the old scars on his breast,
<A NAME="155"></A><BR>Proud memories of fights fought long ago.
<A NAME="156"></A><BR><BR>So when they all stood mailed in battle-gear,
<A NAME="157"></A><BR>Forth of the gates they poured all eager-souled
<A NAME="158"></A><BR>For war.  Against the chariots of the Greeks
<A NAME="159"></A><BR>Their chariots charged; their ranks of footmen pressed
<A NAME="160"></A><BR>To meet the footmen of the foe.  The earth
<A NAME="161"></A><BR>Rang to the tramp of onset; pealed the cheer
<A NAME="162"></A><BR>From man to man; swift closed the fronts of war.
<A NAME="163"></A><BR>Loud clashed their arms all round; from either side
<A NAME="164"></A><BR>War-cries were mingled in one awful roar
<A NAME="165"></A><BR>Swift-winged full many a dart and arrow flew
<A NAME="166"></A><BR>From host to host; loud clanged the smitten shields
<A NAME="167"></A><BR>'Neath thrusting spears. neath javelin-point and 
<A NAME="168"></A>sword:
<A NAME="169"></A><BR>Men hewed with battle-axes lightening down;
<A NAME="170"></A><BR>Crimson the armour ran with blood of men.
<A NAME="171"></A><BR>And all this while Troy's wives and daughters watched
<A NAME="172"></A><BR>From high walls that grim battle of the strong.
<A NAME="173"></A><BR>All trembled as they prayed for husbands, sons,
<A NAME="174"></A><BR>And brothers: white-haired sires amidst them sat,
<A NAME="175"></A><BR>And gazed, while anguished fear for sons devoured
<A NAME="176"></A><BR>Their hearts.  But Helen in her bower abode
<A NAME="177"></A><BR>Amidst her maids, there held by utter shame.
<A NAME="178"></A><BR><BR>So without pause before the wall they fought,
<A NAME="179"></A><BR>While Death exulted o'er them; deadly Strife
<A NAME="180"></A><BR>Shrieked out a long wild cry from host to host.
<A NAME="181"></A><BR>With blood of slain men dust became red mire:
<A NAME="182"></A><BR>Here, there, fast fell the warriors mid the fray.
<A NAME="183"></A><BR><BR>Then slew Deiphobus the charioteer
<A NAME="184"></A><BR>Of Nestor, Hippasus' son: from that high car
<A NAME="185"></A><BR>Down fell he 'midst the dead; fear seized his lord
<A NAME="186"></A><BR>Lest, while his hands were cumbered with the reins,
<A NAME="187"></A><BR>He too by Priam's strong son might be slain.
<A NAME="188"></A><BR>Melanthius marked his plight: swiftly he sprang
<A NAME="189"></A><BR>Upon the car; he urged the horses on,
<A NAME="190"></A><BR>Shaking the reins, goading them with his spear,
<A NAME="191"></A><BR>Seeing the scourge was lost.  But Priam's son
<A NAME="192"></A><BR>Left these, and plunged amid a throng of foes.
<A NAME="193"></A><BR>There upon many he brought the day of doom;
<A NAME="194"></A><BR>For like a ruining tempest on he stormed
<A NAME="195"></A><BR>Through reeling ranks.  His mighty hand struck down
<A NAME="196"></A><BR>Foes numberless: the plain was heaped with dead.
<A NAME="197"></A><BR><BR>As when a woodman on the long-ridged hills
<A NAME="198"></A><BR>Plunges amid the forest-depths, and hews
<A NAME="199"></A><BR>With might and main, and fells sap-laden trees
<A NAME="200"></A><BR>To make him store of charcoal from the heaps
<A NAME="201"></A><BR>Of billets overturfed and set afire:
<A NAME="202"></A><BR>The trunks on all sides fallen strew the slopes,
<A NAME="203"></A><BR>While o'er his work the man exulteth; so
<A NAME="204"></A><BR>Before Deiphobus' swift death-dealing hands
<A NAME="205"></A><BR>In heaps the Achaeans each on other fell.
<A NAME="206"></A><BR>The charging lines of Troy swept over some;
<A NAME="207"></A><BR>Some fled to Xanthus' stream: Deiphobus chased
<A NAME="208"></A><BR>Into the flood yet more, and slew and slew.
<A NAME="209"></A><BR>As when on fish-abounding Hellespont's strand
<A NAME="210"></A><BR>The fishermen hard-straining drag a net
<A NAME="211"></A><BR>Forth of the depths to land; but, while it trails
<A NAME="212"></A><BR>Yet through the sea, one leaps amid the waves
<A NAME="213"></A><BR>Grasping in hand a sinuous-headed spear
<A NAME="214"></A><BR>To deal the sword-fish death, and here and there,
<A NAME="215"></A><BR>Fast as he meets them, slays them, and with blood
<A NAME="216"></A><BR>The waves are reddened; so were Xanthus' streams
<A NAME="217"></A><BR>Impurpled by his hands, and choked with dead.
<A NAME="218"></A><BR><BR>Yet not without sore loss the Trojans fought;
<A NAME="219"></A><BR>For all this while Peleides' fierce-heart son
<A NAME="220"></A><BR>Of other ranks made havoc.  Thetis gazed
<A NAME="221"></A><BR>Rejoicing in her son's son, with a joy
<A NAME="222"></A><BR>As great as was her grief for Achilles slain.
<A NAME="223"></A><BR>For a great host beneath his spear were hurled
<A NAME="224"></A><BR>Down to the dust, steeds, warriors slaughter-blent.
<A NAME="225"></A><BR>And still he chased, and still he slew: he smote
<A NAME="226"></A><BR>Amides war-renowned, who on his steed
<A NAME="227"></A><BR>Bore down on him, but of his horsemanship
<A NAME="228"></A><BR>Small profit won.  The bright spear pierced him 
<A NAME="229"></A>through
<A NAME="230"></A><BR>From navel unto spine, and all his bowels
<A NAME="231"></A><BR>Gushed out, and deadly Doom laid hold on him
<A NAME="232"></A><BR>Even as he fell beside his horse's feet.
<A NAME="233"></A><BR>Ascanius and Oenops next he slew;
<A NAME="234"></A><BR>Under the fifth rib of the one he drave
<A NAME="235"></A><BR>His spear, the other stabbed he 'neath the throat
<A NAME="236"></A><BR>Where a wound bringeth surest doom to man.
<A NAME="237"></A><BR>Whomso he met besides he slew -- the names
<A NAME="238"></A><BR>What man could tell of all that by the hands
<A NAME="239"></A><BR>Of Neoptolemus died?  Never his limbs
<A NAME="240"></A><BR>Waxed weary.  As some brawny labourer,
<A NAME="241"></A><BR>With strong hands toiling in a fruitful field
<A NAME="242"></A><BR>The livelong day, rains down to earth the fruit
<A NAME="243"></A><BR>Of olives, swiftly beating with his pole,
<A NAME="244"></A><BR>And with the downfall covers all the ground,
<A NAME="245"></A><BR>So fast fell 'neath his hands the thronging foe.
<A NAME="246"></A><BR><BR>Elsewhere did Agamemnon, Tydeus' son,
<A NAME="247"></A><BR>And other chieftains of the Danaans toil
<A NAME="248"></A><BR>With fury in the fight.  Yet never quailed
<A NAME="249"></A><BR>The mighty men of Troy: with heart and soul
<A NAME="250"></A><BR>They also fought, and ever stayed from flight
<A NAME="251"></A><BR>Such as gave back.  Yet many heeded not
<A NAME="252"></A><BR>Their chiefs, but fled, cowed by the Achaeans' might.
<A NAME="253"></A><BR><BR>Now at the last Achilles' strong son marked
<A NAME="254"></A><BR>How fast beside Scamander's outfall Greeks
<A NAME="255"></A><BR>Were perishing.  Those Troyward-fleeing foes
<A NAME="256"></A><BR>Whom he had followed slaying, left he now,
<A NAME="257"></A><BR>And bade Automedon thither drive, where hosts
<A NAME="258"></A><BR>Were falling of the Achaeans.  Straightway he
<A NAME="259"></A><BR>Hearkened, and scourged the steeds immortal on
<A NAME="260"></A><BR>To that wild fray: bearing their lord they flew
<A NAME="261"></A><BR>Swiftly o'er battle-highways paved with death.
<A NAME="262"></A><BR><BR>As Ares chariot-borne to murderous war
<A NAME="263"></A><BR>Fares forth, and round his onrush quakes the ground,
<A NAME="264"></A><BR>While on the God's breast clash celestial arms
<A NAME="265"></A><BR>Outflashing fire, so charged Achilles' son
<A NAME="266"></A><BR>Against Deiphobus.  Clouds of dust upsoared
<A NAME="267"></A><BR>About his horses' feet.  Automedon marked
<A NAME="268"></A><BR>The Trojan chief, and knew him.  To his lord
<A NAME="269"></A><BR>Straightway he named that hero war-renowned:
<A NAME="270"></A><BR>"My king, this is Deiphobus' array --
<A NAME="271"></A><BR>The man who from thy father fled in fear.
<A NAME="272"></A><BR>Some God or fiend with courage fills him now."
<A NAME="273"></A><BR><BR>Naught answered Neoptolemus, save to bid
<A NAME="274"></A><BR>Drive on the steeds yet faster, that with speed
<A NAME="275"></A><BR>He might avert grim death from perishing friends.
<A NAME="276"></A><BR>But when to each other now full nigh they drew,
<A NAME="277"></A><BR>Deiphobus, despite his battle-lust,
<A NAME="278"></A><BR>Stayed, as a ravening fire stays when it meets
<A NAME="279"></A><BR>Water.  He marvelled, seeing Achilles' steeds
<A NAME="280"></A><BR>And that gigantic son, huge as his sire;
<A NAME="281"></A><BR>And his heart wavered, choosing now to flee,
<A NAME="282"></A><BR>And now to face that hero, man to man
<A NAME="283"></A><BR>As when a mountain boar from his young brood
<A NAME="284"></A><BR>Chases the jackals -- then a lion leaps
<A NAME="285"></A><BR>From hidden ambush into view: the boar
<A NAME="286"></A><BR>Halts in his furious onset, loth to advance,
<A NAME="287"></A><BR>Loth to retreat, while foam his jaws about
<A NAME="288"></A><BR>His whetted tusks; so halted Priam's son
<A NAME="289"></A><BR>Car-steeds and car, perplexed, while quivered his 
<A NAME="290"></A>hands
<A NAME="291"></A><BR>About the lance.  Shouted Achilles' son:
<A NAME="292"></A><BR>"Ho, Priam's son, why thus so mad to smite
<A NAME="293"></A><BR>Those weaker Argives, who have feared thy wrath
<A NAME="294"></A><BR>And fled thine onset?  So thou deem'st thyself
<A NAME="295"></A><BR>Far mightiest!  If thine heart be brave indeed,
<A NAME="296"></A><BR>Of my spear now make trial in the strife."
<A NAME="297"></A><BR><BR>On rushed he, as a lion against a stag,
<A NAME="298"></A><BR>Borne by the steeds and chariot of his sire.
<A NAME="299"></A><BR>And now full soon his lance had slain his foe,
<A NAME="300"></A><BR>Him and his charioteer -- but Phoebus poured
<A NAME="301"></A><BR>A dense cloud round him from the viewless heights
<A NAME="302"></A><BR>Of heaven, and snatched him from the deadly fray,
<A NAME="303"></A><BR>And set him down in Troy, amid the rout
<A NAME="304"></A><BR>Of fleeing Trojans: so did Peleus' son
<A NAME="305"></A><BR>Stab but the empty air; and loud he cried:
<A NAME="306"></A><BR>"Dog, thou hast 'scaped my wrath!  No might of thine
<A NAME="307"></A><BR>Saved thee, though ne'er so fain!  Some God hath 
<A NAME="308"></A>cast
<A NAME="309"></A><BR>Night's veil o'er thee, and snatched thee from thy 
<A NAME="310"></A>death."
<A NAME="311"></A><BR><BR>Then Cronos' Son dispersed that dense dark cloud:
<A NAME="312"></A><BR>Mist-like it thinned and vanished into air:
<A NAME="313"></A><BR>Straightway the plain and all the land were seen.
<A NAME="314"></A><BR>Then far away about the Scaean Gate
<A NAME="315"></A><BR>He saw the Trojans: seeming like his sire,
<A NAME="316"></A><BR>He sped against them; they at his coming quailed.
<A NAME="317"></A><BR>As shipmen tremble when a wild wave bears
<A NAME="318"></A><BR>Down on their bark, wind-heaved until it swings
<A NAME="319"></A><BR>Broad, mountain-high above them, when the sea
<A NAME="320"></A><BR>Is mad with tempest; so, as on he came,
<A NAME="321"></A><BR>Terror clad all those Trojans as a cloak,
<A NAME="322"></A><BR>The while he shouted, cheering on his men:
<A NAME="323"></A><BR>"Hear, friends! -- fill full your hearts with dauntless 
<A NAME="324"></A>strength,
<A NAME="325"></A><BR>The strength that well beseemeth mighty men
<A NAME="326"></A><BR>Who thirst to win them glorious victory,
<A NAME="327"></A><BR>To win renown from battle's tumult!  Come,
<A NAME="328"></A><BR>Brave hearts, now strive we even beyond our strength
<A NAME="329"></A><BR>Till we smite Troy's proud city, till we win
<A NAME="330"></A><BR>Our hearts' desire!  Foul shame it were to abide
<A NAME="331"></A><BR>Long deedless here and strengthless, womanlike!
<A NAME="332"></A><BR>Ere I be called war-blencher, let me die!"
<A NAME="333"></A><BR><BR>Then unto Ares' work their spirits flamed.
<A NAME="334"></A><BR>Down on the Trojans charged they: yea, and these
<A NAME="335"></A><BR>Fought with high courage, round their city now,
<A NAME="336"></A><BR>And now from wall and gate-towers.  Never lulled
<A NAME="337"></A><BR>The rage of war, while Trojan hearts were hot
<A NAME="338"></A><BR>To hurl the foemen back, and the strong Greeks
<A NAME="339"></A><BR>To smite the town: grim havoc compassed all.
<A NAME="340"></A><BR><BR>Then, eager for the Trojans' help, swooped down
<A NAME="341"></A><BR>Out of Olympus, cloaked about with clouds,
<A NAME="342"></A><BR>The son of Leto.  Mighty rushing winds
<A NAME="343"></A><BR>Bare him in golden armour clad; and gleamed
<A NAME="344"></A><BR>With lightning-splendour of his descent the long
<A NAME="345"></A><BR>Highways of air.  His quiver clashed; loud rang
<A NAME="346"></A><BR>The welkin; earth re-echoed, as he set
<A NAME="347"></A><BR>His tireless feet by Xanthus.  Pealed his shout
<A NAME="348"></A><BR>Dreadly, with courage filling them of Troy,
<A NAME="349"></A><BR>Scaring their foes from biding the red fray.
<A NAME="350"></A><BR>But of all this the mighty Shaker of Earth
<A NAME="351"></A><BR>Was ware: he breathed into the fainting
<A NAME="352"></A><BR>Greeks Fierce valour, and the fight waxed murderous
<A NAME="353"></A><BR>Through those Immortals' clashing wills.  Then died
<A NAME="354"></A><BR>Hosts numberless on either side.  In wrath
<A NAME="355"></A><BR>Apollo thought to smite Achilles' son
<A NAME="356"></A><BR>In the same place where erst he smote his sire;
<A NAME="357"></A><BR>But birds of boding screamed to left, to stay
<A NAME="358"></A><BR>His mood, and other signs from heaven were sent;
<A NAME="359"></A><BR>Yet was his wrath not minded to obey
<A NAME="360"></A><BR>Those portents.  Swiftly drew Earth-shaker nigh
<A NAME="361"></A><BR>In mist celestial cloaked: about his feet
<A NAME="362"></A><BR>Quaked the dark earth as came the Sea-king on.
<A NAME="363"></A><BR>Then, to stay Phoebus' hand, he cried to him:
<A NAME="364"></A><BR>"Refrain thy wrath: Achilles' giant son
<A NAME="365"></A><BR>Slay not!  Olympus' Lord himself shall be
<A NAME="366"></A><BR>Wroth for his death, and bitter grief shall light
<A NAME="367"></A><BR>On me and all the Sea-gods, as erstwhile
<A NAME="368"></A><BR>For Achilles' sake.  Nay, get thee back to heights
<A NAME="369"></A><BR>Celestial, lest thou kindle me to wrath,
<A NAME="370"></A><BR>And so I cleave a sudden chasm in earth,
<A NAME="371"></A><BR>And Ilium and all her walls go down
<A NAME="372"></A><BR>To darkness.  Thine own soul were vexed thereat."
<A NAME="373"></A><BR><BR>Then, overawed by the brother of his sire,
<A NAME="374"></A><BR>And fearing for Troy's fate and for her folk,
<A NAME="375"></A><BR>To heaven went back Apollo, to the sea
<A NAME="376"></A><BR>Poseidon.  But the sons of men fought on,
<A NAME="377"></A><BR>And slew; and Strife incarnate gloating watched.
<A NAME="378"></A><BR><BR>At last by Calchas' counsel Achaea's sons
<A NAME="379"></A><BR>Drew back to the ships, and put from them the thought
<A NAME="380"></A><BR>Of battle, seeing it was not foreordained
<A NAME="381"></A><BR>That Ilium should fall until the might
<A NAME="382"></A><BR>Of war-wise Philoctetes came to aid
<A NAME="383"></A><BR>The Achaean host.  This had the prophet learnt.
<A NAME="384"></A><BR>From birds of prosperous omen, or had read
<A NAME="385"></A><BR>In hearts of victims.  Wise in prophecy-lore
<A NAME="386"></A><BR>Was he, and like a God knew things to be.
<A NAME="387"></A><BR><BR>Trusting in him, the sons of Atreus stayed
<A NAME="388"></A><BR>Awhile the war, and unto Lemnos, land
<A NAME="389"></A><BR>Of stately mansions, sent they Tydeus' son
<A NAME="390"></A><BR>And battle-staunch Odysseus oversea.
<A NAME="391"></A><BR>Fast by the Fire-god's city sped they on
<A NAME="392"></A><BR>Over the broad flood of the Aegean Sea
<A NAME="393"></A><BR>To vine-clad Lemnos, where in far-off days
<A NAME="394"></A><BR>The wives wreaked murderous vengeance on their lords,
<A NAME="395"></A><BR>In fierce wrath that they gave them not their due,
<A NAME="396"></A><BR>But couched beside the handmaid-thralls of Thrace,
<A NAME="397"></A><BR>The captives of their spears when they laid waste
<A NAME="398"></A><BR>The land of warrior Thracians.  Then these wives,
<A NAME="399"></A><BR>Their hearts with fiery jealousy's fever filled,
<A NAME="400"></A><BR>Murdered in every home with merciless hands
<A NAME="401"></A><BR>Their husbands: no compassion would they show
<A NAME="402"></A><BR>To their own wedded lords -- such madness shakes
<A NAME="403"></A><BR>The heart of man or woman, when it burns
<A NAME="404"></A><BR>With jealousy's fever, stung by torturing pangs.
<A NAME="405"></A><BR>So with souls filled with desperate hardihood
<A NAME="406"></A><BR>In one night did they slaughter all their lords;
<A NAME="407"></A><BR>And on a widowed nation rose the sun.
<A NAME="408"></A><BR><BR>To hallowed Lemnos came those heroes twain;
<A NAME="409"></A><BR>They marked the rocky cave where lay the son
<A NAME="410"></A><BR>Of princely Poeas.  Horror came on them
<A NAME="411"></A><BR>When they beheld the hero of their quest
<A NAME="412"></A><BR>Groaning with bitter pangs, on the hard earth
<A NAME="413"></A><BR>Lying, with many feathers round him strewn,
<A NAME="414"></A><BR>And others round his body, rudely sewn
<A NAME="415"></A><BR>Into a cloak, a screen from winter's cold.
<A NAME="416"></A><BR>For, oft as famine stung him, would he shoot
<A NAME="417"></A><BR>The shaft that missed no fowl his aim had doomed.
<A NAME="418"></A><BR>Their flesh he ate, their feathers vestured him.
<A NAME="419"></A><BR>And there lay herbs and healing leaves, the which,
<A NAME="420"></A><BR>Spread on his deadly wound, assuaged its pangs.
<A NAME="421"></A><BR>Wild tangled elf-locks hung about his head.
<A NAME="422"></A><BR>He seemed a wild beast, that hath set its foot,
<A NAME="423"></A><BR>Prowling by night, upon a hidden trap,
<A NAME="424"></A><BR>And so hath been constrained in agony
<A NAME="425"></A><BR>To bite with fierce teeth through the prisoned limb
<A NAME="426"></A><BR>Ere it could win back to its cave, and there
<A NAME="427"></A><BR>In hunger and torturing pains it languisheth.
<A NAME="428"></A><BR>So in that wide cave suffering crushed the man;
<A NAME="429"></A><BR>And all his frame was wasted: naught but skin
<A NAME="430"></A><BR>Covered his bones.  Unwashen there he crouched
<A NAME="431"></A><BR>With famine-haggard cheeks, with sunken eyes
<A NAME="432"></A><BR>Glaring his misery 'neath cavernous brows.
<A NAME="433"></A><BR>Never his groaning ceased, for evermore
<A NAME="434"></A><BR>The ulcerous black wound, eating to the bone,
<A NAME="435"></A><BR>Festered with thrills of agonizing pain.
<A NAME="436"></A><BR>As when a beetling cliff, by seething seas
<A NAME="437"></A><BR>Aye buffeted, is carved and underscooped,
<A NAME="438"></A><BR>For all its stubborn strength, by tireless waves,
<A NAME="439"></A><BR>Till, scourged by winds and lashed by tempest-flails,
<A NAME="440"></A><BR>The sea into deep caves hath gnawed its base;
<A NAME="441"></A><BR>So greater 'neath his foot grew evermore
<A NAME="442"></A><BR>The festering wound, dealt when the envenomed fangs
<A NAME="443"></A><BR>Tare him of that fell water-snake, which men
<A NAME="444"></A><BR>Say dealeth ghastly wounds incurable,
<A NAME="445"></A><BR>When the hot sun hath parched it as it crawls
<A NAME="446"></A><BR>Over the sands; and so that mightiest man
<A NAME="447"></A><BR>Lay faint and wasted with his cureless pain;
<A NAME="448"></A><BR>And from the ulcerous wound aye streamed to earth
<A NAME="449"></A><BR>Fetid corruption fouling all the floor
<A NAME="450"></A><BR>Of that wide cave, a marvel to be heard
<A NAME="451"></A><BR>Of men unborn.  Beside his stony bed
<A NAME="452"></A><BR>Lay a long quiver full of arrows, some
<A NAME="453"></A><BR>For hunting, some to smite his foes withal;
<A NAME="454"></A><BR>With deadly venom of that fell water-snake
<A NAME="455"></A><BR>Were these besmeared.  Before it, nigh to his hand,
<A NAME="456"></A><BR>Lay the great bow, with curving tips of horn,
<A NAME="457"></A><BR>Wrought by the mighty hands of Hercules.
<A NAME="458"></A><BR><BR>Now when that solitary spied these twain
<A NAME="459"></A><BR>Draw nigh his cave, he sprang to his bow, he laid
<A NAME="460"></A><BR>The deadly arrow on the string; for now
<A NAME="461"></A><BR>Fierce memory of his wrongs awoke against
<A NAME="462"></A><BR>These, who had left him years agone, in pain
<A NAME="463"></A><BR>Groaning upon the desolate sea-shore.
<A NAME="464"></A><BR>Yea, and his heart's stem will he had swiftly wrought,
<A NAME="465"></A><BR>But, even as upon that godlike twain
<A NAME="466"></A><BR>He gazed, Athena caused his bitter wrath
<A NAME="467"></A><BR>To melt away.  Then drew they nigh to him
<A NAME="468"></A><BR>With looks of sad compassion, and sat down
<A NAME="469"></A><BR>On either hand beside him in the cave,
<A NAME="470"></A><BR>And of his deadly wound and grievous pangs
<A NAME="471"></A><BR>Asked; and he told them all his sufferings.
<A NAME="472"></A><BR>And they spake hope and comfort; and they said:
<A NAME="473"></A><BR>"Thy woeful wound, thine anguish, shall be healed,
<A NAME="474"></A><BR>If thou but come with us to Achaea's host --
<A NAME="475"></A><BR>The host that now is sorrowing after thee
<A NAME="476"></A><BR>With all its kings.  And no man of them all
<A NAME="477"></A><BR>Was cause of thine affliction, but the Fates,
<A NAME="478"></A><BR>The cruel ones, whom none that walk the earth
<A NAME="479"></A><BR>Escape, but aye they visit hapless men
<A NAME="480"></A><BR>Unseen; and day by day with pitiless hearts
<A NAME="481"></A><BR>Now they afflict men, now again exalt
<A NAME="482"></A><BR>To honour -- none knows why; for all the woes
<A NAME="483"></A><BR>And all the joys of men do these devise
<A NAME="484"></A><BR>After their pleasure."  Hearkening he sat
<A NAME="485"></A><BR>To Odysseus and to godlike Diomede;
<A NAME="486"></A><BR>And all the hoarded wrath for olden wrongs
<A NAME="487"></A><BR>And all the torturing rage, melted away.
<A NAME="488"></A><BR><BR>Straight to the strand dull-thundering and the 
<A NAME="489"></A>ship,
<A NAME="490"></A><BR>Laughing for joy, they bare him with his bow.
<A NAME="491"></A><BR>There washed they all his body and that foul wound
<A NAME="492"></A><BR>With sponges, and with plenteous water bathed:
<A NAME="493"></A><BR>So was his soul refreshed.  Then hasted they
<A NAME="494"></A><BR>And made meat ready for the famished man,
<A NAME="495"></A><BR>And in the galley supped with him.  Then came
<A NAME="496"></A><BR>The balmy night, and sleep slid down on them.
<A NAME="497"></A><BR>Till rose the dawn they tarried by the strand
<A NAME="498"></A><BR>Of sea-girt Lemnos, but with dayspring cast
<A NAME="499"></A><BR>The hawsers loose, and heaved the anchor-stones
<A NAME="500"></A><BR>Out of the deep.  Athena sent a breeze
<A NAME="501"></A><BR>Blowing behind the galley taper-prowed.
<A NAME="502"></A><BR>They strained the sail with either stern-sheet taut;
<A NAME="503"></A><BR>Seaward they pointed the stout-girdered ship;
<A NAME="504"></A><BR>O'er the broad flood she leapt before the wind;
<A NAME="505"></A><BR>Broken to right and left the dark wave sighed,
<A NAME="506"></A><BR>And seething all around was hoary foam,
<A NAME="507"></A><BR>While thronging dolphins raced on either hand
<A NAME="508"></A><BR>Flashing along the paths of silver sea.
<A NAME="509"></A><BR><BR>Full soon to fish-fraught Hellespont they came
<A NAME="510"></A><BR>And the far-stretching ships.  Glad were the Greeks
<A NAME="511"></A><BR>To see the longed-for faces.  Forth the ship
<A NAME="512"></A><BR>With joy they stepped; and Poeas' valiant son
<A NAME="513"></A><BR>On those two heroes leaned thin wasted hands,
<A NAME="514"></A><BR>Who bare him painfully halting to the shore
<A NAME="515"></A><BR>Staying his weight upon their brawny arms.
<A NAME="516"></A><BR>As seems mid mountain-brakes an oak or pine
<A NAME="517"></A><BR>By strength of the woodcutter half hewn through,
<A NAME="518"></A><BR>Which for a little stands on what was left
<A NAME="519"></A><BR>Of the smooth trunk by him who hewed thereat
<A NAME="520"></A><BR>Hard by the roots, that its slow-smouldering wood
<A NAME="521"></A><BR>Might yield him pitch -- now like to one in pain
<A NAME="522"></A><BR>It groans, in weakness borne down by the wind,
<A NAME="523"></A><BR>Yet is upstayed upon its leafy boughs
<A NAME="524"></A><BR>Which from the earth bear up its helpless weight;
<A NAME="525"></A><BR>So by pain unendurable bowed down
<A NAME="526"></A><BR>Leaned he on those brave heroes, and was borne
<A NAME="527"></A><BR>Unto the war-host.  Men beheld, and all
<A NAME="528"></A><BR>Compassionated that great archer, crushed
<A NAME="529"></A><BR>By anguish of his hurt.  But one drew near,
<A NAME="530"></A><BR>Podaleirius, godlike in his power to heal.
<A NAME="531"></A><BR>Swifter than thought he made him whole and sound;
<A NAME="532"></A><BR>For deftly on the wound he spread his salves,
<A NAME="533"></A><BR>Calling on his physician-father's name;
<A NAME="534"></A><BR>And soon the Achaeans shouted all for joy,
<A NAME="535"></A><BR>All praising with one voice Asclepius' son.
<A NAME="536"></A><BR>Lovingly then they bathed him, and with oil
<A NAME="537"></A><BR>Anointed.  All his heaviness of cheer
<A NAME="538"></A><BR>And misery vanished by the Immortals' will;
<A NAME="539"></A><BR>And glad at heart were all that looked on him;
<A NAME="540"></A><BR>And from affliction he awoke to joy.
<A NAME="541"></A><BR>Over the bloodless face the flush of health
<A NAME="542"></A><BR>Glowed, and for wretched weakness mighty strength
<A NAME="543"></A><BR>Thrilled through him: goodly and great waxed all his 
<A NAME="544"></A>limbs.
<A NAME="545"></A><BR>As when a field of corn revives again
<A NAME="546"></A><BR>Which erst had drooped, by rains of ruining storm
<A NAME="547"></A><BR>Down beaten flat, but by warm summer winds
<A NAME="548"></A><BR>Requickened, o'er the laboured land it smiles,
<A NAME="549"></A><BR>So Philoctetes' erstwhile wasted frame
<A NAME="550"></A><BR>Was all requickened: -- in the galley's hold
<A NAME="551"></A><BR>He seemed to have left all cares that crushed his 
<A NAME="552"></A>soul.
<A NAME="553"></A><BR><BR>And Atreus' sons beheld him marvelling
<A NAME="554"></A><BR>As one re-risen from the dead: it seemed
<A NAME="555"></A><BR>The work of hands immortal.  And indeed
<A NAME="556"></A><BR>So was it verily, as their hearts divined;
<A NAME="557"></A><BR>For 'twas the glorious Trito-born that shed
<A NAME="558"></A><BR>Stature and grace upon him.  Suddenly
<A NAME="559"></A><BR>He seemed as when of old mid Argive men
<A NAME="560"></A><BR>He stood, before calamity struck him down.
<A NAME="561"></A><BR>Then unto wealthy Agamemnon's tent
<A NAME="562"></A><BR>Did all their mightiest men bring Poeas' son,
<A NAME="563"></A><BR>And set him chief in honour at the feast,
<A NAME="564"></A><BR>Extolling him.  When all with meat and drink
<A NAME="565"></A><BR>Were filled, spake Agamemnon lord of spears:
<A NAME="566"></A><BR>"Dear friend, since by the will of Heaven our souls
<A NAME="567"></A><BR>Were once perverted, that in sea-girt Lemnos
<A NAME="568"></A><BR>We left thee, harbour not thine heart within
<A NAME="569"></A><BR>Fierce wrath for this: by the blest Gods constrained
<A NAME="570"></A><BR>We did it; and, I trow, the Immortals willed
<A NAME="571"></A><BR>To bring much evil on us, bereft of thee,
<A NAME="572"></A><BR>Who art of all men skilfullest to quell
<A NAME="573"></A><BR>With shafts of death all foes that face thee in 
<A NAME="574"></A>fight.
<A NAME="575"></A><BR>For all the tangled paths of human life,
<A NAME="576"></A><BR>By land and sea, are by the will of Fate
<A NAME="577"></A><BR>Hid from our eyes, in many and devious tracks
<A NAME="578"></A><BR>Are cleft apart, in wandering mazes lost.
<A NAME="579"></A><BR>Along them men by Fortune's dooming drift
<A NAME="580"></A><BR>Like unto leaves that drive before the wind.
<A NAME="581"></A><BR>Oft on an evil path the good man's feet
<A NAME="582"></A><BR>Stumble, the brave finds not a prosperous path;
<A NAME="583"></A><BR>And none of earth-born men can shun the Fates,
<A NAME="584"></A><BR>And of his own will none can choose his way.
<A NAME="585"></A><BR>So then doth it behove the wise of heart
<A NAME="586"></A><BR>Though on a troublous track the winds of fate
<A NAME="587"></A><BR>Sweep him away to suffer and be strong.
<A NAME="588"></A><BR>Since we were blinded then, and erred herein,
<A NAME="589"></A><BR>With rich gifts will we make amends to thee
<A NAME="590"></A><BR>Hereafter, when we take the stately towers
<A NAME="591"></A><BR>Of Troy: but now receive thou handmaids seven,
<A NAME="592"></A><BR>Fleet steeds two-score, victors in chariot-race,
<A NAME="593"></A><BR>And tripods twelve, wherein thine heart may joy
<A NAME="594"></A><BR>Through all thy days; and always in my tent
<A NAME="595"></A><BR>Shall royal honour at the feast be thine."
<A NAME="596"></A><BR><BR>He spake, and gave the hero those fair gifts.
<A NAME="597"></A><BR>Then answered Poeas' mighty-hearted son;
<A NAME="598"></A><BR>"Friend, I forgive thee freely, and all beside
<A NAME="599"></A><BR>Whoso against me haply hath trangressed.
<A NAME="600"></A><BR>I know how good men's minds sometimes be warped:
<A NAME="601"></A><BR>Nor meet it is that one be obdurate
<A NAME="602"></A><BR>Ever, and nurse mean rancours: sternest wrath
<A NAME="603"></A><BR>Must yield anon unto the melting mood.
<A NAME="604"></A><BR>Now pass we to our rest; for better is sleep
<A NAME="605"></A><BR>Than feasting late, for him who longs to fight."
<A NAME="606"></A><BR><BR>He spake, and rose, and came to his comrades' 
<A NAME="607"></A>tent;
<A NAME="608"></A><BR>Then swiftly for their war-fain king they dight
<A NAME="609"></A><BR>The couch, while laughed their hearts for very joy.
<A NAME="610"></A><BR>Gladly he laid him down to sleep till dawn.
<A NAME="611"></A><BR><BR>So passed the night divine, till flushed the 
<A NAME="612"></A>hills
<A NAME="613"></A><BR>In the sun's light, and men awoke to toil.
<A NAME="614"></A><BR>Then all athirst for war the Argive men
<A NAME="615"></A><BR>'Gan whet the spear smooth-shafted, or the dart,
<A NAME="616"></A><BR>Or javelin, and they brake the bread of dawn,
<A NAME="617"></A><BR>And foddered all their horses.  Then to these
<A NAME="618"></A><BR>Spake Poeas' son with battle-kindling speech:
<A NAME="619"></A><BR>"Up!  let us make us ready for the war!
<A NAME="620"></A><BR>Let no man linger mid the galleys, ere
<A NAME="621"></A><BR>The glorious walls of Ilium stately-towered
<A NAME="622"></A><BR>Be shattered, and her palaces be burned!"
<A NAME="623"></A><BR><BR>Then at his words each heart and spirit glowed:
<A NAME="624"></A><BR>They donned their armour, and they grasped their 
<A NAME="625"></A>shields.
<A NAME="626"></A><BR>Forth of the ships in one huge mass they poured
<A NAME="627"></A><BR>Arrayed with bull-hide bucklers, ashen spears,
<A NAME="628"></A><BR>And gallant-crested helms.  Through all their ranks
<A NAME="629"></A><BR>Shoulder to shoulder marched they: thou hadst seen
<A NAME="630"></A><BR>No gap 'twixt man and man as on they charged;
<A NAME="631"></A><BR>So close they thronged, so dense was their array.
