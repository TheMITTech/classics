<A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A><B>How Memnon, Son of the Dawn, for Troy's Sake Fell in the 
<A NAME="11"></A>Battle</B>
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="12"></A>When o'er the crests of the far-echoing hills
<A NAME="13"></A><BR>The splendour of the tireless-racing sun
<A NAME="14"></A><BR>Poured o'er the land, still in their tents rejoiced
<A NAME="15"></A><BR>Achaea's stalwart sons, and still acclaimed
<A NAME="16"></A><BR>Achilles the resistless.  But in Troy
<A NAME="17"></A><BR>Still mourned her people, still from all her towers
<A NAME="18"></A><BR>Seaward they strained their gaze; for one great 
<A NAME="19"></A>fear
<A NAME="20"></A><BR>Gripped all their hearts -- to see that terrible 
<A NAME="21"></A>man
<A NAME="22"></A><BR>At one bound overleap their high-built wall,
<A NAME="23"></A><BR>Then smite with the sword all people therewithin,
<A NAME="24"></A><BR>And burn with fire fanes, palaces, and homes.
<A NAME="25"></A><BR>And old Thymoetes spake to the anguished ones:
<A NAME="26"></A><BR>"Friends, I have lost hope: mine heart seeth not
<A NAME="27"></A><BR>Or help, or bulwark from the storm of war,
<A NAME="28"></A><BR>Now that the aweless Hector, who was once
<A NAME="29"></A><BR>Troy's mighty champion, is in dust laid low.
<A NAME="30"></A><BR>Not all his might availed to escape the Fates,
<A NAME="31"></A><BR>But overborne he was by Achilles' hands,
<A NAME="32"></A><BR>The hands that would, I verily deem, bear down
<A NAME="33"></A><BR>A God, if he defied him to the fight,
<A NAME="34"></A><BR>Even as he overthrew this warrior-queen
<A NAME="35"></A><BR>Penthesileia battle-revelling,
<A NAME="36"></A><BR>From whom all other Argives shrank in fear.
<A NAME="37"></A><BR>Ah, she was marvellous!  When at the first
<A NAME="38"></A><BR>I looked on her, meseemed a Blessed One
<A NAME="39"></A><BR>From heaven had come down hitherward to bring
<A NAME="40"></A><BR>Light to our darkness -- ah, vain hope, vain dream!
<A NAME="41"></A><BR>Go to, let us take counsel, what to do
<A NAME="42"></A><BR>Were best for us.  Or shall we still maintain
<A NAME="43"></A><BR>A hopeless fight against these ruthless foes,
<A NAME="44"></A><BR>Or shall we straightway flee a city doomed?
<A NAME="45"></A><BR>Ay, doomed! -- for never more may we withstand
<A NAME="46"></A><BR>Argives in fighting field, when in the front
<A NAME="47"></A><BR>Of battle pitiless Achilles storms."
<A NAME="48"></A><BR><BR>Then spake Laomedon's son, the ancient king:
<A NAME="49"></A><BR>"Nay, friend, and all ye other sons of Troy,
<A NAME="50"></A><BR>And ye our strong war-helpers, flinch we not
<A NAME="51"></A><BR>Faint-hearted from defence of fatherland!
<A NAME="52"></A><BR>Yet let us go not forth the city-gates
<A NAME="53"></A><BR>To battle with yon foe.  Nay, from our towers
<A NAME="54"></A><BR>And from our ramparts let us make defence,
<A NAME="55"></A><BR>Till our new champion come, the stormy heart
<A NAME="56"></A><BR>Of Memnon.  Lo, he cometh, leading on
<A NAME="57"></A><BR>Hosts numberless, Aethiopia's swarthy sons.
<A NAME="58"></A><BR>By this, I trow, he is nigh unto our gates;
<A NAME="59"></A><BR>For long ago, in sore distress of soul,
<A NAME="60"></A><BR>I sent him urgent summons.  Yea, and he
<A NAME="61"></A><BR>Promised me, gladly promised me, to come
<A NAME="62"></A><BR>To Troy, and make all end of all our woes.
<A NAME="63"></A><BR>And now, I trust, he is nigh.  Let us endure
<A NAME="64"></A><BR>A little longer then; for better far
<A NAME="65"></A><BR>It is like brave men in the fight to die
<A NAME="66"></A><BR>Than flee, and live in shame mid alien fo1k."
<A NAME="67"></A><BR><BR>So spake the old king; but Polydamas,
<A NAME="68"></A><BR>The prudent-hearted, thought not good to war
<A NAME="69"></A><BR>Thus endlessly, and spake his patriot rede:
<A NAME="70"></A><BR>"If Memnon have beyond all shadow of doubt
<A NAME="71"></A><BR>Pledged him to thrust dire ruin far from us,
<A NAME="72"></A><BR>Then do I gainsay not that we await
<A NAME="73"></A><BR>The coming of that godlike man within
<A NAME="74"></A><BR>Our walls -- yet, ah, mine heart misgives me, lest,
<A NAME="75"></A><BR>Though he with all his warriors come, he come
<A NAME="76"></A><BR>But to his death, and unto thousands more,
<A NAME="77"></A><BR>Our people, nought but misery come thereof;
<A NAME="78"></A><BR>For terribly against us leaps the storm
<A NAME="79"></A><BR>Of the Achaeans' might.  But now, go to,
<A NAME="80"></A><BR>Let us not flee afar from this our Troy
<A NAME="81"></A><BR>To wander to some alien land, and there,
<A NAME="82"></A><BR>In the exile's pitiful helplessness, endure
<A NAME="83"></A><BR>All flouts and outrage; nor in our own land
<A NAME="84"></A><BR>Abide we till the storm of Argive war
<A NAME="85"></A><BR>O'erwhelm us.  Nay, even now, late though it be,
<A NAME="86"></A><BR>Better it were for us to render back
<A NAME="87"></A><BR>Unto the Danaans Helen and her wealth,
<A NAME="88"></A><BR>Even all that glory of women brought with her
<A NAME="89"></A><BR>From Sparta, and add other treasure -- yea,
<A NAME="90"></A><BR>Repay it twofold, so to save our Troy
<A NAME="91"></A><BR>And our own souls, while yet the spoiler's hand
<A NAME="92"></A><BR>Is laid not on our substance, and while yet
<A NAME="93"></A><BR>Troy hath not sunk in gulfs of ravening flame.
<A NAME="94"></A><BR>I pray you, take to heart my counsel!  None
<A NAME="95"></A><BR>Shall, well I wot, be given to Trojan men
<A NAME="96"></A><BR>Better than this.  Ah, would that long ago
<A NAME="97"></A><BR>Hector had hearkened to my pleading, when
<A NAME="98"></A><BR>I fain had kept him in the ancient home!"
<A NAME="99"></A><BR><BR>So spake Polydamas the noble and strong,
<A NAME="100"></A><BR>And all the listening Trojans in their hearts
<A NAME="101"></A><BR>Approved; yet none dared utter openly
<A NAME="102"></A><BR>The word, for all with trembling held in awe
<A NAME="103"></A><BR>Their prince and Helen, though for her sole sake
<A NAME="104"></A><BR>Daily they died.  But on that noble man
<A NAME="105"></A><BR>Turned Paris, and reviled him to his face:
<A NAME="106"></A><BR>"Thou dastard battle-blencher Polydamas!
<A NAME="107"></A><BR>Not in thy craven bosom beats a heart
<A NAME="108"></A><BR>That bides the fight, but only fear and panic.
<A NAME="109"></A><BR>Yet dost thou vaunt thee -- quotha! -- still our 
<A NAME="110"></A>best
<A NAME="111"></A><BR>In counsel! -- no man's soul is base as thine!
<A NAME="112"></A><BR>Go to, thyself shrink shivering from the strife!
<A NAME="113"></A><BR>Cower, coward, in thine halls!  But all the rest,
<A NAME="114"></A><BR>We men, will still go armour-girt, until
<A NAME="115"></A><BR>We wrest from this our truceless war a peace
<A NAME="116"></A><BR>That shall not shame us!  'Tis with travail and 
<A NAME="117"></A>toil
<A NAME="118"></A><BR>Of strenuous war that brave men win renown;
<A NAME="119"></A><BR>But flight? -- weak women choose it, and young babes!
<A NAME="120"></A><BR>Thy spirit is like to theirs.  No whit I trust
<A NAME="121"></A><BR>Thee in the day of battle -- thee, the man
<A NAME="122"></A><BR>Who maketh faint the hearts of all the host!"
<A NAME="123"></A><BR><BR>So fiercely he reviled: Polydamas
<A NAME="124"></A><BR>Wrathfully answered; for he shrank not, he,
<A NAME="125"></A><BR>From answering to his face.  A caitiff hound,
<A NAME="126"></A><BR>A reptile fool, is he who fawns on men
<A NAME="127"></A><BR>Before their faces, while his heart is black
<A NAME="128"></A><BR>With malice, and, when they be gone, his tongue
<A NAME="129"></A><BR>Backbites them.  Openly Polydamas
<A NAME="130"></A><BR>Flung back upon the prince his taunt and scoff:
<A NAME="131"></A><BR>"O thou of living men most mischievous!
<A NAME="132"></A><BR>Thy valour -- quotha! -- brings us misery!
<A NAME="133"></A><BR>Thine heart endures, and will endure, that strife
<A NAME="134"></A><BR>Should have no limit, save in utter ruin
<A NAME="135"></A><BR>Of fatherland and people for thy sake!
<A NAME="136"></A><BR>Ne'er may such wantwit valour craze my soul!
<A NAME="137"></A><BR>Be mine to cherish wise discretion aye,
<A NAME="138"></A><BR>A warder that shall keep mine house in peace."
<A NAME="139"></A><BR><BR>Indignantly he spake, and Paris found
<A NAME="140"></A><BR>No word to answer him, for conscience woke
<A NAME="141"></A><BR>Remembrance of all woes he had brought on Troy,
<A NAME="142"></A><BR>And should bring; for his passion-fevered heart
<A NAME="143"></A><BR>Would rather hail quick death than severance
<A NAME="144"></A><BR>From Helen the divinely fair, although
<A NAME="145"></A><BR>For her sake was it that the sons of Troy
<A NAME="146"></A><BR>Even then were gazing from their towers to see
<A NAME="147"></A><BR>The Argives and Achilles drawing nigh.
<A NAME="148"></A><BR><BR>But no long time thereafter came to them
<A NAME="149"></A><BR>Memnon the warrior-king, and brought with him
<A NAME="150"></A><BR>A countless host of swarthy Aethiops.
<A NAME="151"></A><BR>From all the streets of Troy the Trojans flocked
<A NAME="152"></A><BR>Glad-eyed to gaze on him, as seafarers,
<A NAME="153"></A><BR>With ruining tempest utterly forspent,
<A NAME="154"></A><BR>See through wide-parting clouds the radiance
<A NAME="155"></A><BR>Of the eternal-wheeling Northern Wain;
<A NAME="156"></A><BR>So joyed the Troyfolk as they thronged around,
<A NAME="157"></A><BR>And more than all Laomedon's son, for now
<A NAME="158"></A><BR>Leapt in his heart a hope, that yet the ships
<A NAME="159"></A><BR>Might by those Aethiop men be burned with fire;
<A NAME="160"></A><BR>So giantlike their king was, and themselves
<A NAME="161"></A><BR>So huge a host, and so athirst for fight.
<A NAME="162"></A><BR>Therefore with all observance welcomed he
<A NAME="163"></A><BR>The strong son of the Lady of the Dawn
<A NAME="164"></A><BR>With goodly gifts and with abundant cheer.
<A NAME="165"></A><BR>So at the banquet King and Hero sat
<A NAME="166"></A><BR>And talked, this telling of the Danaan chiefs,
<A NAME="167"></A><BR>And all the woes himself had suffered, that
<A NAME="168"></A><BR>Telling of that strange immortality
<A NAME="169"></A><BR>By the Dawn-goddess given to his sire,
<A NAME="170"></A><BR>Telling of the unending flow and ebb
<A NAME="171"></A><BR>Of the Sea-mother, of the sacred flood
<A NAME="172"></A><BR>Of Ocean fathomless-rolling, of the bounds
<A NAME="173"></A><BR>Of Earth that wearieth never of her travail,
<A NAME="174"></A><BR>Of where the Sun-steeds leap from orient waves,
<A NAME="175"></A><BR>Telling withal of all his wayfaring
<A NAME="176"></A><BR>From Ocean's verge to Priam's wall, and spurs
<A NAME="177"></A><BR>Of Ida.  Yea, he told how his strong hands
<A NAME="178"></A><BR>Smote the great army of the Solymi
<A NAME="179"></A><BR>Who barred his way, whose deed presumptuous brought
<A NAME="180"></A><BR>Upon their own heads crushing ruin and woe.
<A NAME="181"></A><BR>So told he all that marvellous tale, and told
<A NAME="182"></A><BR>Of countless tribes and nations seen of him.
<A NAME="183"></A><BR>And Priam heard, and ever glowed his heart
<A NAME="184"></A><BR>Within him; and the old lips answering spake:
<A NAME="185"></A><BR>"Memnon, the Gods are good, who have vouchsafed
<A NAME="186"></A><BR>To me to look upon thine host, and thee
<A NAME="187"></A><BR>Here in mine halls.  O that their grace would so
<A NAME="188"></A><BR>Crown this their boon, that I might see my foes
<A NAME="189"></A><BR>All thrust to one destruction by thy spears.
<A NAME="190"></A><BR>That well may be, for marvellous-like art thou
<A NAME="191"></A><BR>To some invincible Deathless One, yea, more
<A NAME="192"></A><BR>Than any earthly hero.  Wherefore thou,
<A NAME="193"></A><BR>I trust, shalt hurl wild havoc through their host.
<A NAME="194"></A><BR>But now, I pray thee, for this day do thou
<A NAME="195"></A><BR>Cheer at my feast thine heart, and with the morn
<A NAME="196"></A><BR>Shalt thou go forth to battle worthy of thee."
<A NAME="197"></A><BR><BR>Then in his hands a chalice deep and wide
<A NAME="198"></A><BR>He raised, and Memnon in all love he pledged
<A NAME="199"></A><BR>In that huge golden cup, a gift of Gods;
<A NAME="200"></A><BR>For this the cunning God-smith brought to Zeus,
<A NAME="201"></A><BR>His masterpiece, what time the Mighty in Power
<A NAME="202"></A><BR>To Hephaestus gave for bride the Cyprian Queen;
<A NAME="203"></A><BR>And Zeus on Dardanus his godlike son
<A NAME="204"></A><BR>Bestowed it, he on Erichthonius;
<A NAME="205"></A><BR>Erichthonius to Tros the great of heart
<A NAME="206"></A><BR>Gave it, and he with all his treasure-store
<A NAME="207"></A><BR>Bequeathed it unto Ilus, and he gave
<A NAME="208"></A><BR>That wonder to Laomedon, and he
<A NAME="209"></A><BR>To Priam, who had thought to leave the same
<A NAME="210"></A><BR>To his own son.  Fate ordered otherwise.
<A NAME="211"></A><BR>And Memnon clasped his hands about that cup
<A NAME="212"></A><BR>So peerless-beautiful, and all his heart
<A NAME="213"></A><BR>Marvelled; and thus he spake unto the King:
<A NAME="214"></A><BR>"Beseems not with great swelling words to vaunt
<A NAME="215"></A><BR>Amidst the feast, and lavish promises,
<A NAME="216"></A><BR>But rather quietly to eat in hall,
<A NAME="217"></A><BR>And to devise deeds worthy.  Whether I
<A NAME="218"></A><BR>Be brave and strong, or whether I be not,
<A NAME="219"></A><BR>Battle, wherein a man's true might is seen,
<A NAME="220"></A><BR>Shall prove to thee.  Now would I rest, nor drink
<A NAME="221"></A><BR>The long night through.  The battle-eager spirit
<A NAME="222"></A><BR>By measureless wine and lack of sleep is dulled."
<A NAME="223"></A><BR><BR>Marvelled at him the old King, and he said:
<A NAME="224"></A><BR>"As seems thee good touching the banquet, do
<A NAME="225"></A><BR>After thy pleasure.  I, when thou art loth,
<A NAME="226"></A><BR>Will not constrain thee.  Yea, unmeet it is
<A NAME="227"></A><BR>To hold back him who fain would leave the board,
<A NAME="228"></A><BR>Or hurry from one's halls who fain would stay.
<A NAME="229"></A><BR>So is the good old law with all true men."
<A NAME="230"></A><BR><BR>Then rose that champion from the board, and 
<A NAME="231"></A>passed
<A NAME="232"></A><BR>Thence to his sleep -- his last!  And with him went
<A NAME="233"></A><BR>All others from the banquet to their rest:
<A NAME="234"></A><BR>And gentle sleep slid down upon them soon.
<A NAME="235"></A><BR><BR>But in the halls of Zeus, the Lightning-lord,
<A NAME="236"></A><BR>Feasted the gods the while, and Cronos' son,
<A NAME="237"></A><BR>All-father, of his deep foreknowledge spake
<A NAME="238"></A><BR>Amidst them of the issue of the strife:
<A NAME="239"></A><BR>"Be it known unto you all, to-morn shall bring
<A NAME="240"></A><BR>By yonder war affliction swift and sore;
<A NAME="241"></A><BR>For many mighty horses shall ye see
<A NAME="242"></A><BR>In either host beside their chariots slain,
<A NAME="243"></A><BR>And many heroes perishing.  Therefore ye
<A NAME="244"></A><BR>Remember these my words, howe'er ye grieve
<A NAME="245"></A><BR>For dear ones.  Let none clasp my knees in prayer,
<A NAME="246"></A><BR>Since even to us relentless are the fates."
<A NAME="247"></A><BR><BR>So warned he them, which knew before, that all
<A NAME="248"></A><BR>Should from the battle stand aside, howe'er
<A NAME="249"></A><BR>Heart-wrung; that none, petitioning for a son
<A NAME="250"></A><BR>Or dear one, should to Olympus vainly come.
<A NAME="251"></A><BR>So, at that warning of the Thunderer,
<A NAME="252"></A><BR>The Son of Cronos, all they steeled their hearts
<A NAME="253"></A><BR>To bear, and spake no word against their king;
<A NAME="254"></A><BR>For in exceeding awe they stood of him.
<A NAME="255"></A><BR>Yet to their several mansions and their rest
<A NAME="256"></A><BR>With sore hearts went they.  O'er their deathless 
<A NAME="257"></A>eyes
<A NAME="258"></A><BR>The blessing-bringer Sleep his light veils spread.
<A NAME="259"></A><BR><BR>When o'er precipitous crests of mountain-walls
<A NAME="260"></A><BR>Leapt up broad heaven the bright morning-star
<A NAME="261"></A><BR>Who rouseth to their toils from slumber sweet
<A NAME="262"></A><BR>The binders of the sheaf, then his last sleep
<A NAME="263"></A><BR>Unclasped the warrior-son of her who brings
<A NAME="264"></A><BR>Light to the world, the Child of Mists of Night.
<A NAME="265"></A><BR>Now swelled his mighty heart with eagerness
<A NAME="266"></A><BR>To battle with the foe forthright.  And Dawn
<A NAME="267"></A><BR>With most reluctant feet began to climb
<A NAME="268"></A><BR>Heaven's broad highway.  Then did the Trojans gird
<A NAME="269"></A><BR>Their battle-harness on; then armed themselves
<A NAME="270"></A><BR>The Aethiop men, and all the mingled tribes
<A NAME="271"></A><BR>Of those war-helpers that from many lands
<A NAME="272"></A><BR>To Priam's aid were gathered.  Forth the gates
<A NAME="273"></A><BR>Swiftly they rushed, like darkly lowering clouds
<A NAME="274"></A><BR>Which Cronos' Son, when storm is rolling up,
<A NAME="275"></A><BR>Herdeth together through the welkin wide.
<A NAME="276"></A><BR>Swiftly the whole plain filled.  Onward they streamed
<A NAME="277"></A><BR>Like harvest-ravaging locusts drifting on
<A NAME="278"></A><BR>In fashion of heavy-brooding rain-clouds o'er
<A NAME="279"></A><BR>Wide plains of earth, an irresistible host
<A NAME="280"></A><BR>Bringing wan famine on the sons of men;
<A NAME="281"></A><BR>So in their might and multitude they went.
<A NAME="282"></A><BR>The city streets were all too strait for them
<A NAME="283"></A><BR>Marching: upsoared the dust from underfoot.
<A NAME="284"></A><BR><BR>From far the Argives gazed, and marvelling saw
<A NAME="285"></A><BR>Their onrush, but with speed arrayed their limbs
<A NAME="286"></A><BR>In brass, and in the might of Peleus' son
<A NAME="287"></A><BR>Put their glad trust.  Amidst them rode he on
<A NAME="288"></A><BR>Like to a giant Titan, glorying
<A NAME="289"></A><BR>In steeds and chariot, while his armour flashed
<A NAME="290"></A><BR>Splendour around in sudden lightning-gleams.
<A NAME="291"></A><BR>It was as when the sun from utmost bounds
<A NAME="292"></A><BR>Of earth-encompassing ocean comes, and brings
<A NAME="293"></A><BR>Light to the world, and flings his splendour wide
<A NAME="294"></A><BR>Through heaven, and earth and air laugh all around.
<A NAME="295"></A><BR>So glorious, mid the Argives Peleus' son
<A NAME="296"></A><BR>Rode onward.  Mid the Trojans rode the while
<A NAME="297"></A><BR>Memnon the hero, even such to see
<A NAME="298"></A><BR>As Ares furious-hearted.  Onward swept
<A NAME="299"></A><BR>The eager host arrayed about their lord.
<A NAME="300"></A><BR><BR>Then in the grapple of war on either side
<A NAME="301"></A><BR>Closed the long lines, Trojan and Danaan;
<A NAME="302"></A><BR>But chief in prowess still the Aethiops were.
<A NAME="303"></A><BR>Crashed they together as when surges meet
<A NAME="304"></A><BR>On the wild sea, when, in a day of storm,
<A NAME="305"></A><BR>From every quarter winds to battle rush.
<A NAME="306"></A><BR>Foe hurled at foe the ashen spear, and slew:
<A NAME="307"></A><BR>Screams and death-groans went up like roaring fire.
<A NAME="308"></A><BR>As when down-thundering torrents shout and rave
<A NAME="309"></A><BR>On-pouring seaward, when the madding rains
<A NAME="310"></A><BR>Stream from God's cisterns, when the huddling clouds
<A NAME="311"></A><BR>Are hurled against each other ceaselessly,
<A NAME="312"></A><BR>And leaps their fiery breath in flashes forth;
<A NAME="313"></A><BR>So 'neath the fighters' trampling feet the earth
<A NAME="314"></A><BR>Thundered, and leapt the terrible battle-yell
<A NAME="315"></A><BR>Through frenzied air, for mad the war-cries were.
<A NAME="316"></A><BR><BR>For firstfruits of death's harvest Peleus' son
<A NAME="317"></A><BR>Slew Thalius and Mentes nobly born,
<A NAME="318"></A><BR>Men of renown, and many a head beside
<A NAME="319"></A><BR>Dashed he to dust.  As in its furious swoop
<A NAME="320"></A><BR>A whirlwind shakes dark chasms underground,
<A NAME="321"></A><BR>And earth's foundations crumble and melt away
<A NAME="322"></A><BR>Around the deep roots of the shuddering world,
<A NAME="323"></A><BR>So the ranks crumbled in swift doom to the dust
<A NAME="324"></A><BR>Before the spear and fury of Peleus's son.
<A NAME="325"></A><BR><BR>But on the other side the hero child
<A NAME="326"></A><BR>Of the Dawn-goddess slew the Argive men,
<A NAME="327"></A><BR>Like to a baleful Doom which bringeth down
<A NAME="328"></A><BR>On men a grim and ghastly pestilence.
<A NAME="329"></A><BR>First slew he Pheron; for the bitter spear
<A NAME="330"></A><BR>Plunged through his breast, and down on him he hurled
<A NAME="331"></A><BR>Goodly Ereuthus, battle-revellers both,
<A NAME="332"></A><BR>Dwellers in Thryus by Alpheus' streams,
<A NAME="333"></A><BR>Which followed Nestor to the god-built burg
<A NAME="334"></A><BR>Of Ilium.  But when he had laid these low,
<A NAME="335"></A><BR>Against the son of Neleus pressed he on
<A NAME="336"></A><BR>Eager to slay.  Godlike Antilochus
<A NAME="337"></A><BR>Strode forth to meet him, sped the long spear's 
<A NAME="338"></A>flight,
<A NAME="339"></A><BR>Yet missed him, for a little he swerved, but slew
<A NAME="340"></A><BR>His Aethiop comrade, son of Pyrrhasus.
<A NAME="341"></A><BR>Wroth for his fall, against Antilochus
<A NAME="342"></A><BR>He leapt, as leaps a lion mad of mood
<A NAME="343"></A><BR>Upon a boar, the beast that flincheth not
<A NAME="344"></A><BR>From fight with man or brute, whose charge is a 
<A NAME="345"></A>flash
<A NAME="346"></A><BR>Of lightning; so was his swift leap.  His foe
<A NAME="347"></A><BR>Antilochus caught a huge stone from the ground,
<A NAME="348"></A><BR>Hurled, smote him; but unshaken abode his strength,
<A NAME="349"></A><BR>For the strong helm-crest fenced his head from death;
<A NAME="350"></A><BR>But rang the morion round his brows.  His heart
<A NAME="351"></A><BR>Kindled with terrible fury at the blow
<A NAME="352"></A><BR>More than before against Antilochus.
<A NAME="353"></A><BR>Like seething cauldron boiled his maddened might.
<A NAME="354"></A><BR>He stabbed, for all his cunning of fence, the son
<A NAME="355"></A><BR>Of Nestor above the breast; the crashing spear
<A NAME="356"></A><BR>Plunged to the heart, the spot of speediest death.
<A NAME="357"></A><BR><BR>Then upon all the Danaans at his fall
<A NAME="358"></A><BR>Came grief; but anguish-stricken was the heart
<A NAME="359"></A><BR>Of Nestor most of all, to see his child
<A NAME="360"></A><BR>Slain in his sight; for no more bitter pang
<A NAME="361"></A><BR>Smiteth the heart of man than when a son
<A NAME="362"></A><BR>Perishes, and his father sees him die.
<A NAME="363"></A><BR>Therefore, albeit unused to melting mood,
<A NAME="364"></A><BR>His soul was torn with agony for the son
<A NAME="365"></A><BR>By black death slain.  A wild cry hastily
<A NAME="366"></A><BR>To Thrasymedes did he send afar:
<A NAME="367"></A><BR>"Hither to me, Thrasymedes war-renowned!
<A NAME="368"></A><BR>Help me to thrust back from thy brother's corse,
<A NAME="369"></A><BR>Yea, from mine hapless son, his murderer,
<A NAME="370"></A><BR>That so ourselves may render to our dead
<A NAME="371"></A><BR>All dues of mourning.  If thou flinch for fear,
<A NAME="372"></A><BR>No son of mine art thou, nor of the line
<A NAME="373"></A><BR>Of Periclymenus, who dared withstand
<A NAME="374"></A><BR>Hercules' self.  Come, to the battle-toil!
<A NAME="375"></A><BR>For grim necessity oftentimes inspires
<A NAME="376"></A><BR>The very coward with courage of despair."
<A NAME="377"></A><BR><BR>Then at his cry that brother's heart was stung
<A NAME="378"></A><BR>With bitter grief.  Swift for his help drew nigh
<A NAME="379"></A><BR>Phereus, on whom for his great prince's fall
<A NAME="380"></A><BR>Came anguish.  Charged these warriors twain to face
<A NAME="381"></A><BR>Strong Memnon in the gory strife.  As when
<A NAME="382"></A><BR>Two hunters 'mid a forest's mountain-folds,
<A NAME="383"></A><BR>Eager to take the prey, rush on to meet
<A NAME="384"></A><BR>A wild boar or a bear, with hearts afire
<A NAME="385"></A><BR>To slay him, but in furious mood he leaps
<A NAME="386"></A><BR>On them, and holds at bay the might of men;
<A NAME="387"></A><BR>So swelled the heart of Memnon.  Nigh drew they,
<A NAME="388"></A><BR>Yet vainly essayed to slay him, as they hurled
<A NAME="389"></A><BR>The long spears, but the lances glanced aside
<A NAME="390"></A><BR>Far from his flesh: the Dawn-queen turned them thence.
<A NAME="391"></A><BR>Yet fell their spears not vainly to the ground:
<A NAME="392"></A><BR>The lance of fiery-hearted Phereus, winged
<A NAME="393"></A><BR>With eager speed, dealt death to Meges' son,
<A NAME="394"></A><BR>Polymnius: Laomedon was slain
<A NAME="395"></A><BR>By the wrath of Nestor's son for a brother dead,
<A NAME="396"></A><BR>The dear one Memnon slew in battle-rout,
<A NAME="397"></A><BR>And whom the slayer's war-unwearied hands
<A NAME="398"></A><BR>Now stripped of his all-brazen battle-gear,
<A NAME="399"></A><BR>Nought recking, he, of Thrasymedes' might,
<A NAME="400"></A><BR>Nor of stout Phereus, who were unto him
<A NAME="401"></A><BR>But weaklings.  A great lion seemed he there
<A NAME="402"></A><BR>Standing above a hart, as jackals they,
<A NAME="403"></A><BR>That, howso hungry, dare not come too nigh.
<A NAME="404"></A><BR><BR>But hard thereby the father gazed thereon
<A NAME="405"></A><BR>In agony, and cried the rescue-cry
<A NAME="406"></A><BR>To other his war-comrades for their aid
<A NAME="407"></A><BR>Against the foe.  Himself too burned to fight
<A NAME="408"></A><BR>From his war-car; for yearning for the dead
<A NAME="409"></A><BR>Goaded him to the fray beyond his strength.
<A NAME="410"></A><BR>Ay, and himself had been on his dear son
<A NAME="411"></A><BR>Laid, numbered with the dead, had not the voice
<A NAME="412"></A><BR>Of Memnon stayed him even in act to rush
<A NAME="413"></A><BR>Upon him, for he reverenced in his heart
<A NAME="414"></A><BR>The white hairs of an age-mate of his sire:
<A NAME="415"></A><BR>"Ancient," he cried, "it were my shame to fight.
<A NAME="416"></A><BR>With one so much mine elder: I am not
<A NAME="417"></A><BR>Blind unto honour.  Verily I weened
<A NAME="418"></A><BR>That this was some young warrior, when I saw
<A NAME="419"></A><BR>Thee facing thus the foe.  My bold heart hoped
<A NAME="420"></A><BR>For contest worthy of mine hand and spear.
<A NAME="421"></A><BR>Nay, draw thou back afar from battle-toil
<A NAME="422"></A><BR>And bitter death.  Go, lest, how loth soe'er,
<A NAME="423"></A><BR>I smite thee of sore need.  Nay, fall not thou
<A NAME="424"></A><BR>Beside thy son, against a mightier man
<A NAME="425"></A><BR>Fighting, lest men with folly thee should charge,
<A NAME="426"></A><BR>For folly it is that braves o'ermastering might."
<A NAME="427"></A><BR><BR>He spake, and answered him that warrior old:
<A NAME="428"></A><BR>"Nay, Memnon, vain was that last word of thine.
<A NAME="429"></A><BR>None would name fool the father who essayed,
<A NAME="430"></A><BR>Battling with foes for his son's sake, to thrust
<A NAME="431"></A><BR>The ruthless slayer back from that dear corpse,
<A NAME="432"></A><BR>But ah that yet my strength were whole in me,
<A NAME="433"></A><BR>That thou might'st know my spear!  Now canst thou 
<A NAME="434"></A>vaunt
<A NAME="435"></A><BR>Proudly enow: a young man's heart is bold
<A NAME="436"></A><BR>And light his wit.  Uplifted is thy soul
<A NAME="437"></A><BR>And vain thy speech.  If in my strength of youth
<A NAME="438"></A><BR>Thou hadst met me -- ha, thy friends had not rejoiced,
<A NAME="439"></A><BR>For all thy might!  But me the grievous weight
<A NAME="440"></A><BR>Of age bows down, like an old lion whom
<A NAME="441"></A><BR>A cur may boldly drive back from the fold,
<A NAME="442"></A><BR>For that he cannot, in his wrath's despite,
<A NAME="443"></A><BR>Maintain his own cause, being toothless now,
<A NAME="444"></A><BR>And strengthless, and his strong heart tamed by 
<A NAME="445"></A>time.
<A NAME="446"></A><BR>So well the springs of olden strength no more
<A NAME="447"></A><BR>Now in my breast.  Yet am I stronger still
<A NAME="448"></A><BR>Than many men; my grey hairs yield to few
<A NAME="449"></A><BR>That have within them all the strength of youth."
<A NAME="450"></A><BR><BR>So drew he back a little space, and left
<A NAME="451"></A><BR>Lying in dust his son, since now no more
<A NAME="452"></A><BR>Lived in the once lithe limbs the olden strength,
<A NAME="453"></A><BR>For the years' weight lay heavy on his head.
<A NAME="454"></A><BR>Back leapt Thrasymedes likewise, spearman good,
<A NAME="455"></A><BR>And battle-eager Phereus, and the rest
<A NAME="456"></A><BR>Their comrades; for that slaughter-dealing man
<A NAME="457"></A><BR>Pressed hard on them.  As when from mountains high
<A NAME="458"></A><BR>A shouting river with wide-echoing din
<A NAME="459"></A><BR>Sweeps down its fathomless whirlpools through the 
<A NAME="460"></A>gloom,
<A NAME="461"></A><BR>When God with tumult of a mighty storm
<A NAME="462"></A><BR>Hath palled the sky in cloud from verge to verge,
<A NAME="463"></A><BR>When thunders crash all round, when thick and fast
<A NAME="464"></A><BR>Gleam lightnings from the huddling clouds, when 
<A NAME="465"></A>fields
<A NAME="466"></A><BR>Are flooded as the hissing rain descends,
<A NAME="467"></A><BR>And all the air is filled with awful roar
<A NAME="468"></A><BR>Of torrents pouring down the hill-ravines;
<A NAME="469"></A><BR>So Memnon toward the shores of Hellespont
<A NAME="470"></A><BR>Before him hurled the Argives, following hard
<A NAME="471"></A><BR>Behind them, slaughtering ever.  Many a man
<A NAME="472"></A><BR>Fell in the dust, and left his life in blood
<A NAME="473"></A><BR>'Neath Aethiop hands.  Stained was the earth with 
<A NAME="474"></A>gore
<A NAME="475"></A><BR>As Danaans died.  Exulted Memnon's soul
<A NAME="476"></A><BR>As on the ranks of foemen ever he rushed,
<A NAME="477"></A><BR>And heaped with dead was all the plain of Troy.
<A NAME="478"></A><BR>And still from fight refrained he not; he hoped
<A NAME="479"></A><BR>To be a light of safety unto Troy
<A NAME="480"></A><BR>And bane to Danaans.  But all the while
<A NAME="481"></A><BR>Stood baleful Doom beside him, and spurred on
<A NAME="482"></A><BR>To strife, with flattering smile.  To right, to 
<A NAME="483"></A>left
<A NAME="484"></A><BR>His stalwart helpers wrought in battle-toil,
<A NAME="485"></A><BR>Alcyoneus and Nychius, and the son
<A NAME="486"></A><BR>Of Asius furious-souled; Meneclus' spear,
<A NAME="487"></A><BR>Clydon and Alexippus, yea, a host
<A NAME="488"></A><BR>Eager to chase the foe, men who in fight
<A NAME="489"></A><BR>Quit them like men, exulting in their king.
<A NAME="490"></A><BR>Then, as Meneclus on the Danaans charged,
<A NAME="491"></A><BR>The son of Neleus slew him.  Wroth for his friend,
<A NAME="492"></A><BR>Whole throngs of foes fierce-hearted Memnon slew.
<A NAME="493"></A><BR>As when a hunter midst the mountains drives
<A NAME="494"></A><BR>Swift deer within the dark lines of his toils --
<A NAME="495"></A><BR>The eager ring of beaters closing in
<A NAME="496"></A><BR>Presses the huddled throng into the snares
<A NAME="497"></A><BR>Of death: the dogs are wild with joy of the chase
<A NAME="498"></A><BR>Ceaselessly giving tongue, the while his darts
<A NAME="499"></A><BR>Leap winged with death on brocket and on hind;
<A NAME="500"></A><BR>So Memnon slew and ever slew: his men
<A NAME="501"></A><BR>Rejoiced, the while in panic stricken rout
<A NAME="502"></A><BR>Before that glorious man the Argives fled.
<A NAME="503"></A><BR>As when from a steep mountain's precipice-brow
<A NAME="504"></A><BR>Leaps a huge crag, which all-resistless Zeus
<A NAME="505"></A><BR>By stroke of thunderbolt hath hurled from the crest;
<A NAME="506"></A><BR>Crash oakwood copses, echo long ravines,
<A NAME="507"></A><BR>Shudders the forest to its rattle and roar,
<A NAME="508"></A><BR>And flocks therein and herds and wild things flee
<A NAME="509"></A><BR>Scattering, as bounding, whirling, it descends
<A NAME="510"></A><BR>With deadly pitiless onrush; so his foes
<A NAME="511"></A><BR>Fled from the lightning-flash of Memnon's spear.
<A NAME="512"></A><BR><BR>Then to the side of Aeacus' mighty son
<A NAME="513"></A><BR>Came Nestor.  Anguished for his son he cried:
<A NAME="514"></A><BR>"Achilles, thou great bulwark of the Greeks,
<A NAME="515"></A><BR>Slain is my child!  The armour of my dead
<A NAME="516"></A><BR>Hath Memnon, and I fear me lest his corse
<A NAME="517"></A><BR>Be cast a prey to dogs.  Haste to his help!
<A NAME="518"></A><BR>True friend is he who still remembereth
<A NAME="519"></A><BR>A friend though slain, and grieves for one no more."
<A NAME="520"></A><BR><BR>Achilles heard; his heart was thrilled with 
<A NAME="521"></A>grief:
<A NAME="522"></A><BR>He glanced across the rolling battle, saw
<A NAME="523"></A><BR>Memnon, saw where in throngs the Argives fell
<A NAME="524"></A><BR>Beneath his spear.  Forthright he turned away
<A NAME="525"></A><BR>From where the rifted ranks of Troy fell fast
<A NAME="526"></A><BR>Before his hands, and, thirsting for the fight,
<A NAME="527"></A><BR>Wroth for Antilochus and the others slain,
<A NAME="528"></A><BR>Came face to face with Memnon.  In his hands
<A NAME="529"></A><BR>That godlike hero caught up from the ground
<A NAME="530"></A><BR>A stone, a boundary-mark 'twixt fields of wheat,
<A NAME="531"></A><BR>And hurled.  Down on the shield of Peleus' son
<A NAME="532"></A><BR>It crashed.  But he, the invincible, shrank not
<A NAME="533"></A><BR>Before the huge rock-shard, but, thrusting out
<A NAME="534"></A><BR>His long lance, rushed to close with him, afoot,
<A NAME="535"></A><BR>For his steeds stayed behind the battle-rout.
<A NAME="536"></A><BR>On the right shoulder above the shield he smote
<A NAME="537"></A><BR>And staggered him; but he, despite the wound,
<A NAME="538"></A><BR>Fought on with heart unquailing.  Swiftly he thrust
<A NAME="539"></A><BR>And pricked with his strong spear Achilles' arm.
<A NAME="540"></A><BR>Forth gushed the blood: rejoicing with vain joy
<A NAME="541"></A><BR>To Aeacus' son with arrogant words he cried:
<A NAME="542"></A><BR>"Now shalt thou in thy death fill up, I trow,
<A NAME="543"></A><BR>Thy dark doom, overmastered by mine hands.
<A NAME="544"></A><BR>Thou shalt not from this fray escape alive!
<A NAME="545"></A><BR>Fool, wherefore hast thou ruthlessly destroyed
<A NAME="546"></A><BR>Trojans, and vaunted thee the mightiest man
<A NAME="547"></A><BR>Of men, a deathless Nereid's son?  Ha, now
<A NAME="548"></A><BR>Thy doom hath found thee!  Of birth divine am I,
<A NAME="549"></A><BR>The Dawn-queen's mighty son, nurtured afar
<A NAME="550"></A><BR>By lily-slender Hesperid Maids, beside
<A NAME="551"></A><BR>The Ocean-river.  Therefore not from thee
<A NAME="552"></A><BR>Nor from grim battle shrink I, knowing well
<A NAME="553"></A><BR>How far my goddess-mother doth transcend
<A NAME="554"></A><BR>A Nereid, whose child thou vauntest thee.
<A NAME="555"></A><BR>To Gods and men my mother bringeth light;
<A NAME="556"></A><BR>On her depends the issue of all things,
<A NAME="557"></A><BR>Works great and glorious in Olympus wrought
<A NAME="558"></A><BR>Whereof comes blessing unto men.  But thine --
<A NAME="559"></A><BR>She sits in barren crypts of brine: she dwells
<A NAME="560"></A><BR>Glorying mid dumb sea-monsters and mid fish,
<A NAME="561"></A><BR>Deedless, unseen!  Nothing I reck of her,
<A NAME="562"></A><BR>Nor rank her with the immortal Heavenly Ones."
<A NAME="563"></A><BR><BR>In stern rebuke spake Aeacus' aweless son:
<A NAME="564"></A><BR>"Memnon, how wast thou so distraught of wit
<A NAME="565"></A><BR>That thou shouldst face me, and to fight defy
<A NAME="566"></A><BR>Me, who in might, in blood, in stature far
<A NAME="567"></A><BR>Surpass thee?  From supremest Zeus I trace
<A NAME="568"></A><BR>My glorious birth; and from the strong Sea-god
<A NAME="569"></A><BR>Nereus, begetter of the Maids of the Sea,
<A NAME="570"></A><BR>The Nereids, honoured of the Olympian Gods.
<A NAME="571"></A><BR>And chiefest of them all is Thetis, wise
<A NAME="572"></A><BR>With wisdom world-renowned; for in her bowers
<A NAME="573"></A><BR>She sheltered Dionysus, chased by might
<A NAME="574"></A><BR>Of murderous Lycurgus from the earth.
<A NAME="575"></A><BR>Yea, and the cunning God-smith welcomed she
<A NAME="576"></A><BR>Within her mansion, when from heaven he fell.
<A NAME="577"></A><BR>Ay, and the Lightning-lord she once released
<A NAME="578"></A><BR>From bonds.  The all-seeing Dwellers in the Sky
<A NAME="579"></A><BR>Remember all these things, and reverence
<A NAME="580"></A><BR>My mother Thetis in divine Olympus.
<A NAME="581"></A><BR>Ay, that she is a Goddess shalt thou know
<A NAME="582"></A><BR>When to thine heart the brazen spear shall pierce
<A NAME="583"></A><BR>Sped by my might.  Patroclus' death I avenged
<A NAME="584"></A><BR>On Hector, and Antilochus on thee
<A NAME="585"></A><BR>Will I avenge.  No weakling's friend thou hast slain!
<A NAME="586"></A><BR>But why like witless children stand we here
<A NAME="587"></A><BR>Babbling our parents' fame and our own deeds?
<A NAME="588"></A><BR>Now is the hour when prowess shall decide."
<A NAME="589"></A><BR><BR>Then from the sheath he flashed his long keen 
<A NAME="590"></A>sword,
<A NAME="591"></A><BR>And Memnon his; and swiftly in fiery fight
<A NAME="592"></A><BR>Closed they, and rained the never-ceasing blows
<A NAME="593"></A><BR>Upon the bucklers which with craft divine
<A NAME="594"></A><BR>Hephaestus' self had fashioned.  Once and again
<A NAME="595"></A><BR>Clashed they together, and their cloudy crests
<A NAME="596"></A><BR>Touched, mingling all their tossing storm of hair.
<A NAME="597"></A><BR>And Zeus, for that he loved them both, inspired
<A NAME="598"></A><BR>With prowess each, and mightier than their wont
<A NAME="599"></A><BR>He made them, made them tireless, nothing like
<A NAME="600"></A><BR>To men, but Gods: and gloated o'er the twain
<A NAME="601"></A><BR>The Queen of Strife.  In eager fury these
<A NAME="602"></A><BR>Thrust swiftly out the spear, with fell intent
<A NAME="603"></A><BR>To reach the throat 'twixt buckler-rim and helm,
<A NAME="604"></A><BR>Thrust many a time and oft, and now would aim
<A NAME="605"></A><BR>The point beneath the shield, above the greave,
<A NAME="606"></A><BR>Now close beneath the corslet curious-wrought
<A NAME="607"></A><BR>That lapped the stalwart frame: hard, fast they 
<A NAME="608"></A>lunged,
<A NAME="609"></A><BR>And on their shoulders clashed the arms divine.
<A NAME="610"></A><BR>Roared to the very heavens the battle-shout
<A NAME="611"></A><BR>Of warring men, of Trojans, Aethiops,
<A NAME="612"></A><BR>And Argives mighty-hearted, while the dust
<A NAME="613"></A><BR>Rolled up from 'neath their feet, tossed to the 
<A NAME="614"></A>sky
<A NAME="615"></A><BR>In stress of battle-travail great and strong.
<A NAME="616"></A><BR><BR>As when a mist enshrouds the hills, what time
<A NAME="617"></A><BR>Roll up the rain-clouds, and the torrent-beds
<A NAME="618"></A><BR>Roar as they fill with rushing floods, and howls
<A NAME="619"></A><BR>Each gorge with fearful voices; shepherds quake
<A NAME="620"></A><BR>To see the waters' downrush and the mist,
<A NAME="621"></A><BR>Screen dear to wolves and all the wild fierce things
<A NAME="622"></A><BR>Nursed in the wide arms of the forest; so
<A NAME="623"></A><BR>Around the fighters' feet the choking dust
<A NAME="624"></A><BR>Hung, hiding the fair splendour of the sun
<A NAME="625"></A><BR>And darkening all the heaven.  Sore distressed
<A NAME="626"></A><BR>With dust and deadly conflict were the folk.
<A NAME="627"></A><BR>Then with a sudden hand some Blessed One
<A NAME="628"></A><BR>Swept the dust-pall aside; and the Gods saw
<A NAME="629"></A><BR>The deadly Fates hurling the charging lines
<A NAME="630"></A><BR>Together, in the unending wrestle locked
<A NAME="631"></A><BR>Of that grim conflict, saw where never ceased
<A NAME="632"></A><BR>Ares from hideous slaughter, saw the earth
<A NAME="633"></A><BR>Crimsoned all round with rushing streams of blood,
<A NAME="634"></A><BR>Saw where dark Havoc gloated o'er the scene,
<A NAME="635"></A><BR>Saw the wide plain with corpses heaped, even all
<A NAME="636"></A><BR>Bounded 'twixt Simois and Xanthus, where
<A NAME="637"></A><BR>They sweep from Ida down to Hellespont.
<A NAME="638"></A><BR><BR>But when long lengthened out the conflict was
<A NAME="639"></A><BR>Of those two champions, and the might of both
<A NAME="640"></A><BR>In that strong tug and strain was equal-matched,
<A NAME="641"></A><BR>Then, gazing from Olympus' far-off heights,
<A NAME="642"></A><BR>The Gods joyed, some in the invincible son
<A NAME="643"></A><BR>Of Peleus, others in the goodly child
<A NAME="644"></A><BR>Of old Tithonus and the Queen of Dawn.
<A NAME="645"></A><BR>Thundered the heavens on high from east to west,
<A NAME="646"></A><BR>And roared the sea from verge to verge, and rocked
<A NAME="647"></A><BR>The dark earth 'neath the heroes' feet, and quaked
<A NAME="648"></A><BR>Proud Nereus' daughters all round Thetis thronged
<A NAME="649"></A><BR>In grievous fear for mighty Achilles' sake;
<A NAME="650"></A><BR>And trembled for her son the Child of the Mist
<A NAME="651"></A><BR>As in her chariot through the sky she rode.
<A NAME="652"></A><BR>Marvelled the Daughters of the Sun, who stood
<A NAME="653"></A><BR>Near her, around that wondrous splendour-ring
<A NAME="654"></A><BR>Traced for the race-course of the tireless sun
<A NAME="655"></A><BR>By Zeus, the limit of all Nature's life
<A NAME="656"></A><BR>And death, the dally round that maketh up
<A NAME="657"></A><BR>The eternal circuit of the rolling years.
<A NAME="658"></A><BR>And now amongst the Blessed bitter feud
<A NAME="659"></A><BR>Had broken out; but by behest of Zeus
<A NAME="660"></A><BR>The twin Fates suddenly stood beside these twain,
<A NAME="661"></A><BR>One dark -- her shadow fell on Memnon's heart;
<A NAME="662"></A><BR>One bright -- her radiance haloed Peleus' son.
<A NAME="663"></A><BR>And with a great cry the Immortals saw,
<A NAME="664"></A><BR>And filled with sorrow they of the one part were,
<A NAME="665"></A><BR>They of the other with triumphant joy.
<A NAME="666"></A><BR><BR>Still in the midst of blood-stained battle-rout
<A NAME="667"></A><BR>Those heroes fought, unknowing of the Fates
<A NAME="668"></A><BR>Now drawn so nigh, but each at other hurled
<A NAME="669"></A><BR>His whole heart's courage, all his bodily might.
<A NAME="670"></A><BR>Thou hadst said that in the strife of that dread 
<A NAME="671"></A>day
<A NAME="672"></A><BR>Huge tireless Giants or strong Titans warred,
<A NAME="673"></A><BR>So fiercely blazed the wildfire of their strife,
<A NAME="674"></A><BR>Now, when they clashed with swords, now when they 
<A NAME="675"></A>leapt
<A NAME="676"></A><BR>Hurling huge stones.  Nor either would give back
<A NAME="677"></A><BR>Before the hail of blows, nor quailed.  They stood
<A NAME="678"></A><BR>Like storm-tormented headlands steadfast, clothed
<A NAME="679"></A><BR>With might past words, unearthly; for the twain
<A NAME="680"></A><BR>Alike could boast their lineage of high Zeus.
<A NAME="681"></A><BR>Therefore 'twixt these Enyo lengthened out
<A NAME="682"></A><BR>The even-balanced strife, while ever they
<A NAME="683"></A><BR>In that grim wrestle strained their uttermost,
<A NAME="684"></A><BR>They and their dauntless comrades, round their kings
<A NAME="685"></A><BR>With ceaseless fury toiling, till their spears
<A NAME="686"></A><BR>Stood shivered all in shields of warriors slain,
<A NAME="687"></A><BR>And of the fighters woundless none remained;
<A NAME="688"></A><BR>But from all limbs streamed down into the dust
<A NAME="689"></A><BR>The blood and sweat of that unresting strain
<A NAME="690"></A><BR>Of fight, and earth was hidden with the dead,
<A NAME="691"></A><BR>As heaven is hidden with clouds when meets the sun
<A NAME="692"></A><BR>The Goat-star, and the shipman dreads the deep.
<A NAME="693"></A><BR>As charged the lines, the snorting chariot-steeds
<A NAME="694"></A><BR>Trampled the dead, as on the myriad leaves
<A NAME="695"></A><BR>Ye trample in the woods at entering-in
<A NAME="696"></A><BR>Of winter, when the autumn-tide is past.
<A NAME="697"></A><BR><BR>Still mid the corpses and the blood fought on
<A NAME="698"></A><BR>Those glorious sons of Gods, nor ever ceased
<A NAME="699"></A><BR>From wrath of fight.  But Eris now inclined
<A NAME="700"></A><BR>The fatal scales of battle, which no more
<A NAME="701"></A><BR>Were equal-poised.  Beneath the breast-bone then
<A NAME="702"></A><BR>Of godlike Memnon plunged Achilles' sword;
<A NAME="703"></A><BR>Clear through his body all the dark-blue blade
<A NAME="704"></A><BR>Leapt: suddenly snapped the silver cord of life.
<A NAME="705"></A><BR>Down in a pool of blood he fell, and clashed
<A NAME="706"></A><BR>His massy armour, and earth rang again.
<A NAME="707"></A><BR>Then turned to flight his comrades panic-struck,
<A NAME="708"></A><BR>And of his arms the Myrmidons stripped the dead,
<A NAME="709"></A><BR>While fled the Trojans, and Achilles chased,
<A NAME="710"></A><BR>As whirlwind swift and mighty to destroy.
<A NAME="711"></A><BR><BR>Then groaned the Dawn, and palled herself in 
<A NAME="712"></A>clouds,
<A NAME="713"></A><BR>And earth was darkened.  At their mother's hest
<A NAME="714"></A><BR>All the light Breathings of the Dawn took hands,
<A NAME="715"></A><BR>And slid down one 1ong stream of sighing wind
<A NAME="716"></A><BR>To Priam's plain, and floated round the dead,
<A NAME="717"></A><BR>And softly, swiftly caught they up, and bare
<A NAME="718"></A><BR>Through silver mists the Dawn-queen's son, with 
<A NAME="719"></A>hearts
<A NAME="720"></A><BR>Sore aching for their brother's fall, while moaned
<A NAME="721"></A><BR>Around them all the air.  As on they passed,
<A NAME="722"></A><BR>Fell many blood-gouts from those pierced limbs
<A NAME="723"></A><BR>Down to the earth, and these were made a sign
<A NAME="724"></A><BR>To generations yet to be.  The Gods
<A NAME="725"></A><BR>Gathered them up from many lands, and made
<A NAME="726"></A><BR>Thereof a far-resounding river, named
<A NAME="727"></A><BR>Of all that dwell beneath long Ida's flanks
<A NAME="728"></A><BR>Paphlagoneion.  As its waters flow
<A NAME="729"></A><BR>'Twixt fertile acres, once a year they turn
<A NAME="730"></A><BR>To blood, when comes the woeful day whereon
<A NAME="731"></A><BR>Died Memnon.  Thence a sick and choking reek
<A NAME="732"></A><BR>Steams: thou wouldst say that from a wound unhealed
<A NAME="733"></A><BR>Corrupting humours breathed an evil stench.
<A NAME="734"></A><BR>Ay, so the Gods ordained: but now flew on
<A NAME="735"></A><BR>Bearing Dawn's mighty son the rushing winds
<A NAME="736"></A><BR>Skimming earth's face and palled about with night.
<A NAME="737"></A><BR><BR>Nor were his Aethiopian comrades left
<A NAME="738"></A><BR>To wander of their King forlorn: a God
<A NAME="739"></A><BR>Suddenly winged those eager souls with speed
<A NAME="740"></A><BR>Such as should soon be theirs for ever, changed
<A NAME="741"></A><BR>To flying fowl, the children of the air.
<A NAME="742"></A><BR>Wailing their King in the winds' track they sped.
<A NAME="743"></A><BR>As when a hunter mid the forest-brakes
<A NAME="744"></A><BR>Is by a boar or grim-jawed lion slain,
<A NAME="745"></A><BR>And now his sorrowing friends take up the corse,
<A NAME="746"></A><BR>And bear it heavy-hearted; and the hounds
<A NAME="747"></A><BR>Follow low-whimpering, pining for their lord
<A NAME="748"></A><BR>In that disastrous hunting lost; so they
<A NAME="749"></A><BR>Left far behind that stricken field of blood,
<A NAME="750"></A><BR>And fast they followed after those swift winds
<A NAME="751"></A><BR><BR>With multitudinous moaning, veiled in mist
<A NAME="752"></A><BR>Unearthly.  Trojans over all the plain
<A NAME="753"></A><BR>And Danaans marvelled, seeing that great host
<A NAME="754"></A><BR>Vanishing with their King.  All hearts stood still
<A NAME="755"></A><BR>In dumb amazement. But the tireless winds
<A NAME="756"></A><BR>Sighing set hero Memnon's giant corpse
<A NAME="757"></A><BR>Down by the deep flow of Aesopus' stream,
<A NAME="758"></A><BR>Where is a fair grove of the bright-haired Nymphs,
<A NAME="759"></A><BR>The which round his long barrow afterward
<A NAME="760"></A><BR>Aesopus' daughters planted, screening it
<A NAME="761"></A><BR>With many and manifold trees: and long and loud
<A NAME="762"></A><BR>Wailed those Immortals, chanting his renown,
<A NAME="763"></A><BR>The son of the Dawn-goddess splendour-throned.
<A NAME="764"></A><BR><BR>Now sank the sun: the Lady of the Morn
<A NAME="765"></A><BR>Wailing her dear child from the heavens came down.
<A NAME="766"></A><BR>Twelve maidens shining-tressed attended her,
<A NAME="767"></A><BR>The warders of the high paths of the sun
<A NAME="768"></A><BR>For ever circling, warders of the night
<A NAME="769"></A><BR>And dawn, and each world-ordinance framed of Zeus,
<A NAME="770"></A><BR>Around whose mansion's everlasting doors
<A NAME="771"></A><BR>From east to west they dance, from west to east,
<A NAME="772"></A><BR>Whirling the wheels of harvest-laden years,
<A NAME="773"></A><BR>While rolls the endless round of winter's cold,
<A NAME="774"></A><BR>And flowery spring, and lovely summer-tide,
<A NAME="775"></A><BR>And heavy-clustered autumn.  These came down
<A NAME="776"></A><BR>From heaven, for Memnon wailing wild and high;
<A NAME="777"></A><BR>And mourned with these the Pleiads.  Echoed round
<A NAME="778"></A><BR>Far-stretching mountains, and Aesopus' stream.
<A NAME="779"></A><BR>Ceaseless uprose the keen, and in their midst,
<A NAME="780"></A><BR>Fallen on her son and clasping, wailed the Dawn;
<A NAME="781"></A><BR>"Dead art thou, dear, dear child, and thou hast 
<A NAME="782"></A>clad
<A NAME="783"></A><BR>Thy mother with a pall of grief.  Oh, I,
<A NAME="784"></A><BR>Now thou art slain, will not endure to light
<A NAME="785"></A><BR>The Immortal Heavenly Ones!  No, I will plunge
<A NAME="786"></A><BR>Down to the dread depths of the underworld,
<A NAME="787"></A><BR>Where thy lone spirit flitteth to and fro,
<A NAME="788"></A><BR>And will to blind night leave earth, sky, and sea,
<A NAME="789"></A><BR>Till Chaos and formless darkness brood o'er all,
<A NAME="790"></A><BR>That Cronos' Son may also learn what means
<A NAME="791"></A><BR>Anguish of heart.  For not less worship-worthy
<A NAME="792"></A><BR>Than Nereus' Child, by Zeus's ordinance,
<A NAME="793"></A><BR>Am I, who look on all things, I, who bring
<A NAME="794"></A><BR>All to their consummation.  Recklessly
<A NAME="795"></A><BR>My light Zeus now despiseth!  Therefore I
<A NAME="796"></A><BR>Will pass into the darkness.  Let him bring
<A NAME="797"></A><BR>Up to Olympus Thetis from the sea
<A NAME="798"></A><BR>To hold for him light forth to Gods and men!
<A NAME="799"></A><BR>My sad soul loveth darkness more than day,
<A NAME="800"></A><BR>Lest I pour light upon thy slayer's head"
<A NAME="801"></A><BR><BR>Thus as she cried, the tears ran down her face
<A NAME="802"></A><BR>Immortal, like a river brimming aye:
<A NAME="803"></A><BR>Drenched was the dark earth round the corse.  The 
<A NAME="804"></A>Night
<A NAME="805"></A><BR>Grieved in her daughter's anguish, and the heaven
<A NAME="806"></A><BR>Drew over all his stars a veil of mist
<A NAME="807"></A><BR>And cloud, of love unto the Lady of Light.
<A NAME="808"></A><BR><BR>Meanwhile within their walls the Trojan folk
<A NAME="809"></A><BR>For Memnon sorrowed sore, with vain regret
<A NAME="810"></A><BR>Yearning for that lost king and all his host.
<A NAME="811"></A><BR>Nor greatly joyed the Argives, where they lay
<A NAME="812"></A><BR>Camped in the open plain amidst the dead.
<A NAME="813"></A><BR>There, mingled with Achilles' praise, uprose
<A NAME="814"></A><BR>Wails for Antilochus: joy clasped hands with grief.
<A NAME="815"></A><BR><BR>All night in groans and sighs most pitiful
<A NAME="816"></A><BR>The Dawn-queen lay: a sea of darkness moaned
<A NAME="817"></A><BR>Around her.  Of the dayspring nought she recked:
<A NAME="818"></A><BR>She loathed Olympus' spaces.  At her side
<A NAME="819"></A><BR>Fretted and whinnied still her fleetfoot steeds,
<A NAME="820"></A><BR>Trampling the strange earth, gazing at their Queen
<A NAME="821"></A><BR>Grief-stricken, yearning for the fiery course.
<A NAME="822"></A><BR>Suddenly crashed the thunder of the wrath
<A NAME="823"></A><BR>Of Zeus; rocked round her all the shuddering earth,
<A NAME="824"></A><BR>And on immortal Eos trembling came.
<A NAME="825"></A><BR><BR>Swiftly the dark-skinned Aethiops from her sight
<A NAME="826"></A><BR>Buried their lord lamenting.  As they wailed
<A NAME="827"></A><BR>Unceasingly, the Dawn-queen lovely-eyed
<A NAME="828"></A><BR>Changed them to birds sweeping through air around
<A NAME="829"></A><BR>The barrow of the mighty dead.  And these
<A NAME="830"></A><BR>Still do the tribes of men "The Memnons" call;
<A NAME="831"></A><BR>And still with wailing cries they dart and wheel
<A NAME="832"></A><BR>Above their king's tomb, and they scatter dust
<A NAME="833"></A><BR>Down on his grave, still shrill the battle-cry,
<A NAME="834"></A><BR>In memory of Memnon, each to each.
<A NAME="835"></A><BR>But he in Hades' mansions, or perchance
<A NAME="836"></A><BR>Amid the Blessed on the Elysian Plain,
<A NAME="837"></A><BR>Laugheth.  Divine Dawn comforteth her heart
<A NAME="838"></A><BR>Beholding them: but theirs is toil of strife
<A NAME="839"></A><BR>Unending, till the weary victors strike
<A NAME="840"></A><BR>The vanquished dead, or one and all fill up
<A NAME="841"></A><BR>The measure of their doom around his grave.
<A NAME="842"></A><BR><BR>So by command of Eos, Lady of Light,
<A NAME="843"></A><BR>The swift birds dree their weird.  But Dawn divine
<A NAME="844"></A><BR>Now heavenward soared with the all-fostering Hours,
<A NAME="845"></A><BR>Who drew her to Zeus' threshold, sorely loth,
<A NAME="846"></A><BR>Yet conquered by their gentle pleadings, such
<A NAME="847"></A><BR>As salve the bitterest grief of broken hearts.
<A NAME="848"></A><BR>Nor the Dawn-queen forgat her daily course,
<A NAME="849"></A><BR>But quailed before the unbending threat of Zeus,
<A NAME="850"></A><BR>Of whom are all things, even all comprised
<A NAME="851"></A><BR>Within the encircling sweep of Ocean's stream,
<A NAME="852"></A><BR>Earth and the palace-dome of burning stars.
<A NAME="853"></A><BR>Before her went her Pleiad-harbingers,
<A NAME="854"></A><BR>Then she herself flung wide the ethereal gates,
<A NAME="855"></A><BR>And, scattering spray of splendour, flashed there-through.
