<A NAME="10"></A><B>How the Wooden Horse Was Fashioned, and Brought into Troy By Her 
<A NAME="11"></A>People</B>
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="12"></A>When round the walls of Troy the Danaan host
<A NAME="13"></A><BR>Had borne much travail, and yet the end was not,
<A NAME="14"></A><BR>By Calchas then assembled were the chiefs;
<A NAME="15"></A><BR>For his heart was instructed by the hests
<A NAME="16"></A><BR>Of Phoebus, by the flights of birds, the stars,
<A NAME="17"></A><BR>And all the signs that speak to men the will
<A NAME="18"></A><BR>Of Heaven; so he to that assembly cried:
<A NAME="19"></A><BR>"No longer toil in leaguer of yon walls;
<A NAME="20"></A><BR>Some other counsel let your hearts devise,
<A NAME="21"></A><BR>Some stratagem to help the host and us.
<A NAME="22"></A><BR>For here but yesterday I saw a sign:
<A NAME="23"></A><BR>A falcon chased a dove, and she, hard pressed,
<A NAME="24"></A><BR>Entered a cleft of the rock; and chafing he
<A NAME="25"></A><BR>Tarried long time hard by that rift, but she
<A NAME="26"></A><BR>Abode in covert.  Nursing still his wrath,
<A NAME="27"></A><BR>He hid him in a bush.  Forth darted she,
<A NAME="28"></A><BR>In folly deeming him afar: he swooped,
<A NAME="29"></A><BR>And to the hapless dove dealt wretched death.
<A NAME="30"></A><BR>Therefore by force essay we not to smite Troy,
<A NAME="31"></A><BR>but let cunning stratagem avail."
<A NAME="32"></A><BR><BR>He spake; but no man's wit might find a way
<A NAME="33"></A><BR>To escape their grievous travail, as they sought
<A NAME="34"></A><BR>To find a remedy, till Laertes' son
<A NAME="35"></A><BR>Discerned it of his wisdom, and he spake:
<A NAME="36"></A><BR>"Friend, in high honour held of the Heavenly Ones,
<A NAME="37"></A><BR>If doomed it be indeed that Priam's burg
<A NAME="38"></A><BR>By guile must fall before the war-worn Greeks,
<A NAME="39"></A><BR>A great Horse let us fashion, in the which
<A NAME="40"></A><BR>Our mightiest shall take ambush.  Let the host
<A NAME="41"></A><BR>Burn all their tents, and sail from hence away
<A NAME="42"></A><BR>To Tenedos; so the Trojans, from their towers
<A NAME="43"></A><BR>Gazing, shall stream forth fearless to the plain.
<A NAME="44"></A><BR>Let some brave man, unknown of any in Troy,
<A NAME="45"></A><BR>With a stout heart abide without the Horse,
<A NAME="46"></A><BR>Crouching beneath its shadow, who shall say:
<A NAME="47"></A><BR>"`Achaea's lords of might, exceeding fain
<A NAME="48"></A><BR>Safe to win home, made this their offering
<A NAME="49"></A><BR>For safe return, an image to appease
<A NAME="50"></A><BR>The wrath of Pallas for her image stolen
<A NAME="51"></A><BR>From Troy.'  And to this story shall he stand,
<A NAME="52"></A><BR>How long soe'er they question him, until,
<A NAME="53"></A><BR>Though never so relentless, they believe,
<A NAME="54"></A><BR>And drag it, their own doom, within the town.
<A NAME="55"></A><BR>Then shall war's signal unto us be given --
<A NAME="56"></A><BR>To them at sea, by sudden flash of torch,
<A NAME="57"></A><BR>To the ambush, by the cry, `Come forth the Horse!'
<A NAME="58"></A><BR>When unsuspecting sleep the sons of Troy."
<A NAME="59"></A><BR><BR>He spake, and all men praised him: most of all
<A NAME="60"></A><BR>Extolled him Calchas, that such marvellous guile
<A NAME="61"></A><BR>He put into the Achaeans' hearts, to be
<A NAME="62"></A><BR>For them assurance of triumph, but for Troy
<A NAME="63"></A><BR>Ruin; and to those battle-lords he cried:
<A NAME="64"></A><BR>"Let your hearts seek none other stratagem,
<A NAME="65"></A><BR>Friends; to war-strong Odysseus' rede give ear.
<A NAME="66"></A><BR>His wise thought shall not miss accomplishment.
<A NAME="67"></A><BR>Yea, our desire even now the Gods fulfil.
<A NAME="68"></A><BR>Hark!  for new tokens come from the Unseen!
<A NAME="69"></A><BR>Lo, there on high crash through the firmament
<A NAME="70"></A><BR>Zeus' thunder and lightning!  See, where birds to 
<A NAME="71"></A>right
<A NAME="72"></A><BR>Dart past, and scream with long-resounding cry!
<A NAME="73"></A><BR>Go to, no more in endless leaguer of Troy
<A NAME="74"></A><BR>Linger we.  Hard necessity fills the foe
<A NAME="75"></A><BR>With desperate courage that makes cowards brave;
<A NAME="76"></A><BR>For then are men most dangerous, when they stake
<A NAME="77"></A><BR>Their lives in utter recklessness of death,
<A NAME="78"></A><BR>As battle now the aweless sons of Troy
<A NAME="79"></A><BR>All round their burg, mad with the lust of fight."
<A NAME="80"></A><BR><BR>But cried Achilles' battle-eager son:
<A NAME="81"></A><BR>"Calchas, brave men meet face to face their foes!
<A NAME="82"></A><BR>Who skulk behind their walls, and fight from towers,
<A NAME="83"></A><BR>Are nidderings, hearts palsied with base fear.
<A NAME="84"></A><BR>Hence with all thought of wile and stratagem!
<A NAME="85"></A><BR>The great war-travail of the spear beseems
<A NAME="86"></A><BR>True heroes.  Best in battle are the brave."
<A NAME="87"></A><BR><BR>But answer made to him Laertes' seed:
<A NAME="88"></A><BR>"Bold-hearted child of aweless Aeacus' son,
<A NAME="89"></A><BR>This as beseems a hero princely and brave,
<A NAME="90"></A><BR>Dauntlessly trusting in thy strength, thou say'st.
<A NAME="91"></A><BR>Yet thine invincible sire's unquailing might
<A NAME="92"></A><BR>Availed not to smite Priam's wealthy burg,
<A NAME="93"></A><BR>Nor we, for all our travail.  Nay, with speed,
<A NAME="94"></A><BR>As counselleth Calchas, go we to the ships,
<A NAME="95"></A><BR>And fashion we the Horse by Epeius' hands,
<A NAME="96"></A><BR>Who in the woodwright's craft is chiefest far
<A NAME="97"></A><BR>Of Argives, for Athena taught his lore."
<A NAME="98"></A><BR><BR>Then all their mightiest men gave ear to him
<A NAME="99"></A><BR>Save twain, fierce-hearted Neoptolemus
<A NAME="100"></A><BR>And Philoctetes mighty-souled; for these
<A NAME="101"></A><BR>Still were insatiate for the bitter fray,
<A NAME="102"></A><BR>Still longed for turmoil of the fight.  They bade
<A NAME="103"></A><BR>Their own folk bear against that giant wall
<A NAME="104"></A><BR>What things soe'er for war's assaults avail,
<A NAME="105"></A><BR>In hope to lay that stately fortress low,
<A NAME="106"></A><BR>Seeing Heaven's decrees had brought them both to 
<A NAME="107"></A>war.
<A NAME="108"></A><BR>Yea, they had haply accomplished all their will,
<A NAME="109"></A><BR>But from the sky Zeus showed his wrath; he shook
<A NAME="110"></A><BR>The earth beneath their feet, and all the air
<A NAME="111"></A><BR>Shuddered, as down before those heroes twain
<A NAME="112"></A><BR>He hurled his thunderbolt: wide echoes crashed
<A NAME="113"></A><BR>Through all Dardania.  Unto fear straightway
<A NAME="114"></A><BR>Turned were their bold hearts: they forgat their 
<A NAME="115"></A>might,
<A NAME="116"></A><BR>And Calchas' counsels grudgingly obeyed.
<A NAME="117"></A><BR>So with the Argives came they to the ships
<A NAME="118"></A><BR>In reverence for the seer who spake from Zeus
<A NAME="119"></A><BR>Or Phoebus, and they obeyed him utterly.
<A NAME="120"></A><BR><BR>What time round splendour-kindled heavens the 
<A NAME="121"></A>stars
<A NAME="122"></A><BR>From east to west far-flashing wheel, and when
<A NAME="123"></A><BR>Man doth forget his toil, in that still hour
<A NAME="124"></A><BR>Athena left the high mansions of the Blest,
<A NAME="125"></A><BR>Clothed her in shape of a maiden tender-fleshed,
<A NAME="126"></A><BR>And came to ships and host.  Over the head
<A NAME="127"></A><BR>Of brave Epeius stood she in his dream,
<A NAME="128"></A><BR>And bade him build a Horse of tree: herself
<A NAME="129"></A><BR>Would labour in his labour, and herself
<A NAME="130"></A><BR>Stand by his side, to the work enkindling him.
<A NAME="131"></A><BR>Hearing the Goddess' word, with a glad laugh
<A NAME="132"></A><BR>Leapt he from careless sleep: right well he knew
<A NAME="133"></A><BR>The Immortal One celestial.  Now his heart
<A NAME="134"></A><BR>Could hold no thought beside; his mind was fixed
<A NAME="135"></A><BR>Upon the wondrous work, and through his soul
<A NAME="136"></A><BR>Marched marshalled each device of craftsmanship.
<A NAME="137"></A><BR><BR>When rose the dawn, and thrust back kindly night
<A NAME="138"></A><BR>To Erebus, and through the firmament streamed
<A NAME="139"></A><BR>Glad glory, then Epeius told his dream
<A NAME="140"></A><BR>To eager Argives -- all he saw and heard;
<A NAME="141"></A><BR>And hearkening joyed they with exceeding joy.
<A NAME="142"></A><BR>Straightway to tall-tressed Ida's leafy glades
<A NAME="143"></A><BR>The sons of Atreus sent swift messengers.
<A NAME="144"></A><BR>These laid the axe unto the forest-pines,
<A NAME="145"></A><BR>And hewed the great trees: to their smiting rang
<A NAME="146"></A><BR>The echoing glens.  On those far-stretching hills
<A NAME="147"></A><BR>All bare of undergrowth the high peaks rose:
<A NAME="148"></A><BR>Open their glades were, not, as in time past,
<A NAME="149"></A><BR>Haunted of beasts: there dry the tree-trunks rose
<A NAME="150"></A><BR>Wooing the winds.  Even these the Achaeans hewed
<A NAME="151"></A><BR>With axes, and in haste they bare them down
<A NAME="152"></A><BR>From those shagged mountain heights to Hellespont's 
<A NAME="153"></A>shores.
<A NAME="154"></A><BR>Strained with a strenuous spirit at the work
<A NAME="155"></A><BR>Young men and mules; and all the people toiled
<A NAME="156"></A><BR>Each at his task obeying Epeius's hest.
<A NAME="157"></A><BR>For with the keen steel some were hewing beams,
<A NAME="158"></A><BR>Some measuring planks, and some with axes lopped
<A NAME="159"></A><BR>Branches away from trunks as yet unsawn:
<A NAME="160"></A><BR>Each wrought his several work.  Epeius first
<A NAME="161"></A><BR>Fashioned the feet of that great Horse of Wood:
<A NAME="162"></A><BR>The belly next he shaped, and over this
<A NAME="163"></A><BR>Moulded the back and the great loins behind,
<A NAME="164"></A><BR>The throat in front, and ridged the towering neck
<A NAME="165"></A><BR>With waving mane: the crested head he wrought,
<A NAME="166"></A><BR>The streaming tail, the ears, the lucent eyes --
<A NAME="167"></A><BR>All that of lifelike horses have.  So grew
<A NAME="168"></A><BR>Like a live thing that more than human work,
<A NAME="169"></A><BR>For a God gave to a man that wondrous craft.
<A NAME="170"></A><BR>And in three days, by Pallas's decree,
<A NAME="171"></A><BR>Finished was all.  Rejoiced thereat the host
<A NAME="172"></A><BR>Of Argos, marvelling how the wood expressed
<A NAME="173"></A><BR>Mettle, and speed of foot -- yea, seemed to neigh.
<A NAME="174"></A><BR>Godlike Epeius then uplifted hands
<A NAME="175"></A><BR>To Pallas, and for that huge Horse he prayed:
<A NAME="176"></A><BR>"Hear, great-souled Goddess: bless thine Horse and 
<A NAME="177"></A>me!"
<A NAME="178"></A><BR>He spake: Athena rich in counsel heard,
<A NAME="179"></A><BR>And made his work a marvel to all men
<A NAME="180"></A><BR>Which saw, or heard its fame in days to be.
<A NAME="181"></A><BR><BR>But while the Danaans o'er Epeius' work
<A NAME="182"></A><BR>Joyed, and their routed foes within the walls
<A NAME="183"></A><BR>Tarried, and shrank from death and pitiless doom,
<A NAME="184"></A><BR>Then, when imperious Zeus far from the Gods
<A NAME="185"></A><BR>Had gone to Ocean's streams and Tethys' caves,
<A NAME="186"></A><BR>Strife rose between the Immortals: heart with heart
<A NAME="187"></A><BR>Was set at variance.  Riding on the blasts
<A NAME="188"></A><BR>Of winds, from heaven to earth they swooped: the 
<A NAME="189"></A>air
<A NAME="190"></A><BR>Crashed round them.  Lighting down by Xanthus' stream
<A NAME="191"></A><BR>Arrayed they stood against each other, these
<A NAME="192"></A><BR>For the Achaeans, for the Trojans those;
<A NAME="193"></A><BR>And all their souls were thrilled with lust of war:
<A NAME="194"></A><BR>There gathered too the Lords of the wide Sea.
<A NAME="195"></A><BR>These in their wrath were eager to destroy
<A NAME="196"></A><BR>The Horse of Guile and all the ships, and those
<A NAME="197"></A><BR>Fair Ilium.  But all-contriving Fate
<A NAME="198"></A><BR>Held them therefrom, and turned their hearts to 
<A NAME="199"></A>strife
<A NAME="200"></A><BR>Against each other.  Ares to the fray
<A NAME="201"></A><BR>Rose first, and on Athena rushed.  Thereat
<A NAME="202"></A><BR>Fell each on other: clashed around their limbs
<A NAME="203"></A><BR>The golden arms celestial as they charged.
<A NAME="204"></A><BR>Round them the wide sea thundered, the dark earth
<A NAME="205"></A><BR>Quaked 'neath immortal feet.  Rang from them all
<A NAME="206"></A><BR>Far-pealing battle-shouts; that awful cry
<A NAME="207"></A><BR>Rolled up to the broad-arching heaven, and down
<A NAME="208"></A><BR>Even to Hades' fathomless abyss:
<A NAME="209"></A><BR>Trembled the Titans there in depths of gloom.
<A NAME="210"></A><BR>Ida's long ridges sighed, sobbed clamorous streams
<A NAME="211"></A><BR>Of ever-flowing rivers, groaned ravines
<A NAME="212"></A><BR>Far-furrowed, Argive ships, and Priam's towers.
<A NAME="213"></A><BR>Yet men feared not, for naught they knew of all
<A NAME="214"></A><BR>That strife, by Heaven's decree.  Then her high 
<A NAME="215"></A>peaks
<A NAME="216"></A><BR>The Gods' hands wrenched from Ida's crest, and hurled
<A NAME="217"></A><BR>Against each other: but like crumbling sands
<A NAME="218"></A><BR>Shivered they fell round those invincible limbs,
<A NAME="219"></A><BR>Shattered to small dust.  But the mind of Zeus,
<A NAME="220"></A><BR>At the utmost verge of earth, was ware of all:
<A NAME="221"></A><BR>Straight left he Ocean's stream, and to wide heaven
<A NAME="222"></A><BR>Ascended, charioted upon the winds,
<A NAME="223"></A><BR>The East, the North, the West-wind, and the South:
<A NAME="224"></A><BR>For Iris rainbow-plumed led 'neath the yoke
<A NAME="225"></A><BR>Of his eternal ear that stormy team,
<A NAME="226"></A><BR>The ear which Time the immortal framed for him
<A NAME="227"></A><BR>Of adamant with never-wearying hands.
<A NAME="228"></A><BR>So came he to Olympus' giant ridge.
<A NAME="229"></A><BR>His wrath shook all the firmament, as crashed
<A NAME="230"></A><BR>From east to west his thunders; lightnings gleamed,
<A NAME="231"></A><BR>As thick and fast his thunderbolts poured to earth,
<A NAME="232"></A><BR>And flamed the limitless welkin.  Terror fell
<A NAME="233"></A><BR>Upon the hearts of those Immortals: quaked
<A NAME="234"></A><BR>The limbs of all -- ay, deathless though they were!
<A NAME="235"></A><BR>Then Themis, trembling for them, swift as thought
<A NAME="236"></A><BR>Leapt down through clouds, and came with speed to them 
<A NAME="237"></A>--
<A NAME="238"></A><BR>For in the strife she only had no part
<A NAME="239"></A><BR>And stood between the fighters, and she cried:
<A NAME="240"></A><BR>"Forbear the conflict!  O, when Zeus is wroth,
<A NAME="241"></A><BR>It ill beseems that everlasting Gods
<A NAME="242"></A><BR>Should fight for men's sake, creatures of a day:
<A NAME="243"></A><BR>Else shall ye be all suddenly destroyed;
<A NAME="244"></A><BR>For Zeus will tear up all the hills, and hurl
<A NAME="245"></A><BR>Upon you: sons nor daughters will he spare,
<A NAME="246"></A><BR>But bury 'neath one ruin of shattered earth
<A NAME="247"></A><BR>All.  No escape shall ye find thence to light,
<A NAME="248"></A><BR>In horror of darkness prisoned evermore."
<A NAME="249"></A><BR><BR>Dreading Zeus' menace gave they heed to her,
<A NAME="250"></A><BR>From strife refrained, and cast away their wrath,
<A NAME="251"></A><BR>And were made one in peace and amity.
<A NAME="252"></A><BR>Some heavenward soared, some plunged into the sea,
<A NAME="253"></A><BR>On earth stayed some.  Amid the Achaean host
<A NAME="254"></A><BR>Spake in his subtlety Laertes' son:
<A NAME="255"></A><BR>"O valorous-hearted lords of the Argive host,
<A NAME="256"></A><BR>Now prove in time of need what men ye be,
<A NAME="257"></A><BR>How passing-strong, how flawless-brave!  The hour
<A NAME="258"></A><BR>Is this for desperate emprise: now, with hearts
<A NAME="259"></A><BR>Heroic, enter ye yon carven horse,
<A NAME="260"></A><BR>So to attain the goal of this stern war.
<A NAME="261"></A><BR>For better it is by stratagem and craft
<A NAME="262"></A><BR>Now to destroy this city, for whose sake
<A NAME="263"></A><BR>Hither we came, and still are suffering
<A NAME="264"></A><BR>Many afflictions far from our own land.
<A NAME="265"></A><BR>Come then, and let your hearts be stout and strong
<A NAME="266"></A><BR>For he who in stress of fight hath turned to bay
<A NAME="267"></A><BR>And snatched a desperate courage from despair,
<A NAME="268"></A><BR>Oft, though the weaker, slays a mightier foe.
<A NAME="269"></A><BR>For courage, which is all men's glory, makes
<A NAME="270"></A><BR>The heart great.  Come then, set the ambush, ye
<A NAME="271"></A><BR>Which be our mightiest, and the rest shall go
<A NAME="272"></A><BR>To Tenedos' hallowed burg, and there abide
<A NAME="273"></A><BR>Until our foes have haled within their walls
<A NAME="274"></A><BR>Us with the Horse, as deeming that they bring
<A NAME="275"></A><BR>A gift unto Tritonis.  Some brave man,
<A NAME="276"></A><BR>One whom the Trojans know not, yet we lack,
<A NAME="277"></A><BR>To harden his heart as steel, and to abide
<A NAME="278"></A><BR>Near by the Horse.  Let that man bear in mind
<A NAME="279"></A><BR>Heedfully whatsoe'er I said erewhile.
<A NAME="280"></A><BR>And let none other thought be in his heart,
<A NAME="281"></A><BR>Lest to the foe our counsel be revealed."
<A NAME="282"></A><BR><BR>Then, when all others feared, a man far-famed
<A NAME="283"></A><BR>Made answer, Sinon, marked of destiny
<A NAME="284"></A><BR>To bring the great work to accomplishment.
<A NAME="285"></A><BR>Therefore with worship all men looked on him,
<A NAME="286"></A><BR>The loyal of heart, as in the midst he spake:
<A NAME="287"></A><BR>"Odysseus, and all ye Achaean chiefs,
<A NAME="288"></A><BR>This work for which ye crave will I perform --
<A NAME="289"></A><BR>Yea, though they torture me, though into fire
<A NAME="290"></A><BR>Living they thrust me; for mine heart is fixed
<A NAME="291"></A><BR>Not to escape, but die by hands of foes,
<A NAME="292"></A><BR>Except I crown with glory your desire."
<A NAME="293"></A><BR><BR>Stoutly he spake: right glad the Argives were;
<A NAME="294"></A><BR>And one said: "How the Gods have given to-day
<A NAME="295"></A><BR>High courage to this man!  He hath not been
<A NAME="296"></A><BR>Heretofore valiant.  Heaven is kindling him
<A NAME="297"></A><BR>To be the Trojans' ruin, but to us
<A NAME="298"></A><BR>Salvation.  Now full soon, I trow, we reach
<A NAME="299"></A><BR>The goal of grievous war, so long unseen."
<A NAME="300"></A><BR><BR>So a voice murmured mid the Achaean host.
<A NAME="301"></A><BR>Then, to stir up the heroes, Nestor cried:
<A NAME="302"></A><BR>"Now is the time, dear sons, for courage and strength:
<A NAME="303"></A><BR>Now do the Gods bring nigh the end of toil:
<A NAME="304"></A><BR>Now give they victory to our longing hands.
<A NAME="305"></A><BR>Come, bravely enter ye this cavernous Horse.
<A NAME="306"></A><BR>For high renown attendeth courage high.
<A NAME="307"></A><BR>Oh that my limbs were mighty as of old,
<A NAME="308"></A><BR>When Aeson's son for heroes called, to man
<A NAME="309"></A><BR>Swift Argo, when of the heroes foremost I
<A NAME="310"></A><BR>Would gladly have entered her, but Pelias
<A NAME="311"></A><BR>The king withheld me in my own despite.
<A NAME="312"></A><BR>Ah me, but now the burden of years -- O nay,
<A NAME="313"></A><BR>As I were young, into the Horse will I
<A NAME="314"></A><BR>Fearlessly!  Glory and strength shall courage give."
<A NAME="315"></A><BR><BR>Answered him golden-haired Achilles' son:
<A NAME="316"></A><BR>"Nestor, in wisdom art thou chief of men;
<A NAME="317"></A><BR>But cruel age hath caught thee in his grip:
<A NAME="318"></A><BR>No more thy strength may match thy gallant will;
<A NAME="319"></A><BR>Therefore thou needs must unto Tenedos' strand.
<A NAME="320"></A><BR>We will take ambush, we the youths, of strife
<A NAME="321"></A><BR>Insatiate still, as thou, old sire, dost bid."
<A NAME="322"></A><BR><BR>Then strode the son of Neleus to his side,
<A NAME="323"></A><BR>And kissed his hands, and kissed the head of him
<A NAME="324"></A><BR>Who offered thus himself the first of all
<A NAME="325"></A><BR>To enter that huge horse, being peril-fain,
<A NAME="326"></A><BR>And bade the elder of days abide without.
<A NAME="327"></A><BR>Then to the battle-eager spake the old:
<A NAME="328"></A><BR>"Thy father's son art thou!  Achilles' might
<A NAME="329"></A><BR>And chivalrous speech be here!  O, sure am I
<A NAME="330"></A><BR>That by thine hands the Argives shall destroy
<A NAME="331"></A><BR>The stately city of Priam.  At the last,
<A NAME="332"></A><BR>After long travail, glory shall be ours,
<A NAME="333"></A><BR>Ours, after toil and tribulation of war;
<A NAME="334"></A><BR>The Gods have laid tribulation at men's feet
<A NAME="335"></A><BR>But happiness far off, and toil between:
<A NAME="336"></A><BR>Therefore for men full easy is the path
<A NAME="337"></A><BR>To ruin, and the path to fame is hard,
<A NAME="338"></A><BR>Where feet must press right on through painful toil."
<A NAME="339"></A><BR><BR>He spake: replied Achilles' glorious son:
<A NAME="340"></A><BR>"Old sire, as thine heart trusteth, be it vouchsafed
<A NAME="341"></A><BR>In answer to our prayers; for best were this:
<A NAME="342"></A><BR>But if the Gods will otherwise, be it so.
<A NAME="343"></A><BR>Ay, gladlier would I fall with glory in fight
<A NAME="344"></A><BR>Than flee from Troy, bowed 'neath a load of shame."
<A NAME="345"></A><BR><BR>Then in his sire's celestial arms he arrayed
<A NAME="346"></A><BR>His shoulders; and with speed in harness sheathed
<A NAME="347"></A><BR>Stood the most mighty heroes, in whose healers
<A NAME="348"></A><BR>Was dauntless spirit.  Tell, ye Queens of Song,
<A NAME="349"></A><BR>Now man by man the names of all that passed
<A NAME="350"></A><BR>Into the cavernous Horse; for ye inspired
<A NAME="351"></A><BR>My soul with all my song, long ere my cheek
<A NAME="352"></A><BR>Grew dark with manhood's beard, what time I fed
<A NAME="353"></A><BR>My goodly sheep on Smyrna's pasture-lea,
<A NAME="354"></A><BR>From Hermus thrice so far as one may hear
<A NAME="355"></A><BR>A man's shout, by the fane of Artemis,
<A NAME="356"></A><BR>In the Deliverer's Grove, upon a hill
<A NAME="357"></A><BR>Neither exceeding low nor passing high.
<A NAME="358"></A><BR><BR>Into that cavernous Horse Achilles' son
<A NAME="359"></A><BR>First entered, strong Menelaus followed then,
<A NAME="360"></A><BR>Odysseus, Sthenelus, godlike Diomede,
<A NAME="361"></A><BR>Philoctetes and Menestheus, Anticlus,
<A NAME="362"></A><BR>Thoas and Polypoetes golden-haired,
<A NAME="363"></A><BR>Aias, Eurypylus, godlike Thrasymede,
<A NAME="364"></A><BR>Idomeneus, Meriones, far-famous twain,
<A NAME="365"></A><BR>Podaleirius of spears, Eurymachus,
<A NAME="366"></A><BR>Teucer the godlike, fierce Ialmenus,
<A NAME="367"></A><BR>Thalpius, Antimachus, Leonteus staunch,
<A NAME="368"></A><BR>Eumelus, and Euryalus fair as a God,
<A NAME="369"></A><BR>Amphimachus, Demophoon, Agapenor,
<A NAME="370"></A><BR>Akamas, Meges stalwart Phyleus' son --
<A NAME="371"></A><BR>Yea, more, even all their chiefest, entered in,
<A NAME="372"></A><BR>So many as that carven Horse could hold.
<A NAME="373"></A><BR>Godlike Epeius last of all passed in,
<A NAME="374"></A><BR>The fashioner of the Horse; in his breast lay
<A NAME="375"></A><BR>The secret of the opening of its doors
<A NAME="376"></A><BR>And of their closing: therefore last of all
<A NAME="377"></A><BR>He entered, and he drew the ladders up
<A NAME="378"></A><BR>Whereby they clomb: then made he all secure,
<A NAME="379"></A><BR>And set himself beside the bolt.  So all
<A NAME="380"></A><BR>In silence sat 'twixt victory and death.
<A NAME="381"></A><BR><BR>But the rest fired the tents, wherein erewhile
<A NAME="382"></A><BR>They slept, and sailed the wide sea in their ships.
<A NAME="383"></A><BR>Two mighty-hearted captains ordered these,
<A NAME="384"></A><BR>Nestor and Agamemnon lord of spears.
<A NAME="385"></A><BR>Fain had they also entered that great Horse,
<A NAME="386"></A><BR>But all the host withheld them, bidding stay
<A NAME="387"></A><BR>With them a-shipboard, ordering their array:
<A NAME="388"></A><BR>For men far better work the works of war
<A NAME="389"></A><BR>When their kings oversee them; therefore these
<A NAME="390"></A><BR>Abode without, albeit mighty men.
<A NAME="391"></A><BR>So came they swiftly unto Tenedos' shore,
<A NAME="392"></A><BR>And dropped the anchor-stones, then leapt in haste
<A NAME="393"></A><BR>Forth of the ships, and silent waited there
<A NAME="394"></A><BR>Keen-watching till the signal-torch should flash.
<A NAME="395"></A><BR><BR>But nigh the foe were they in the Horse, and 
<A NAME="396"></A>now
<A NAME="397"></A><BR>Looked they for death, and now to smite the town;
<A NAME="398"></A><BR>And on their hopes and fears uprose the dawn.
<A NAME="399"></A><BR><BR>Then marked the Trojans upon Hellespont's strand
<A NAME="400"></A><BR>The smoke upleaping yet through air: no more
<A NAME="401"></A><BR>Saw they the ships which brought to them from Greece
<A NAME="402"></A><BR>Destruction dire.  With joy to the shore they ran,
<A NAME="403"></A><BR>But armed them first, for fear still haunted them
<A NAME="404"></A><BR>Then marked they that fair-carven Horse, and stood
<A NAME="405"></A><BR>Marvelling round, for a mighty work was there.
<A NAME="406"></A><BR>A hapless-seeming man thereby they spied,
<A NAME="407"></A><BR>Sinon; and this one, that one questioned him
<A NAME="408"></A><BR>Touching the Danaans, as in a great ring
<A NAME="409"></A><BR>They compassed him, and with unangry words
<A NAME="410"></A><BR>First questioned, then with terrible threatenings.
<A NAME="411"></A><BR>Then tortured they that man of guileful soul
<A NAME="412"></A><BR>Long time unceasing.  Firm as a rock abode
<A NAME="413"></A><BR>The unquivering limbs, the unconquerable will.
<A NAME="414"></A><BR>His ears, his nose, at last they shore away
<A NAME="415"></A><BR>In every wise tormenting him, until
<A NAME="416"></A><BR>He should declare the truth, whither were gone
<A NAME="417"></A><BR>The Danaans in their ships, what thing the Horse
<A NAME="418"></A><BR>Concealed within it.  He had armed his mind
<A NAME="419"></A><BR>With resolution, and of outrage foul
<A NAME="420"></A><BR>Recked not; his soul endured their cruel stripes,
<A NAME="421"></A><BR>Yea, and the bitter torment of the fire;
<A NAME="422"></A><BR>For strong endurance into him Hera breathed;
<A NAME="423"></A><BR>And still he told them the same guileful tale:
<A NAME="424"></A><BR>"The Argives in their ships flee oversea
<A NAME="425"></A><BR>Weary of tribulation of endless war.
<A NAME="426"></A><BR>This horse by Calchas' counsel fashioned they
<A NAME="427"></A><BR>For wise Athena, to propitiate
<A NAME="428"></A><BR>Her stern wrath for that guardian image stol'n
<A NAME="429"></A><BR>From Troy.  And by Odysseus' prompting I
<A NAME="430"></A><BR>Was marked for slaughter, to be sacrificed
<A NAME="431"></A><BR>To the sea-powers, beside the moaning waves,
<A NAME="432"></A><BR>To win them safe return.  But their intent
<A NAME="433"></A><BR>I marked; and ere they spilt the drops of wine,
<A NAME="434"></A><BR>And sprinkled hallowed meal upon mine head,
<A NAME="435"></A><BR>Swiftly I fled, and, by the help of Heaven,
<A NAME="436"></A><BR>I flung me down, clasping the Horse's feet;
<A NAME="437"></A><BR>And they, sore loth, perforce must leave me there
<A NAME="438"></A><BR>Dreading great Zeus's daughter mighty-souled."
<A NAME="439"></A><BR><BR>In subtlety so he spake, his soul untamed
<A NAME="440"></A><BR>By pain; for a brave man's part is to endure
<A NAME="441"></A><BR>To the uttermost.  And of the Trojans some
<A NAME="442"></A><BR>Believed him, others for a wily knave
<A NAME="443"></A><BR>Held him, of whose mind was Laocoon.
<A NAME="444"></A><BR>Wisely he spake: "A deadly fraud is this,"
<A NAME="445"></A><BR>He said, "devised by the Achaean chiefs!"
<A NAME="446"></A><BR>And cried to all straightway to burn the Horse,
<A NAME="447"></A><BR>And know if aught within its timbers lurked.
<A NAME="448"></A><BR><BR>Yea, and they had obeyed him, and had 'scaped
<A NAME="449"></A><BR>Destruction; but Athena, fiercely wroth
<A NAME="450"></A><BR>With him, the Trojans, and their city, shook
<A NAME="451"></A><BR>Earth's deep foundations 'neath Laocoon's feet.
<A NAME="452"></A><BR>Straight terror fell on him, and trembling bowed
<A NAME="453"></A><BR>The knees of the presumptuous: round his head
<A NAME="454"></A><BR>Horror of darkness poured; a sharp pang thrilled
<A NAME="455"></A><BR>His eyelids; swam his eyes beneath his brows;
<A NAME="456"></A><BR>His eyeballs, stabbed with bitter anguish, throbbed
<A NAME="457"></A><BR>Even from the roots, and rolled in frenzy of pain.
<A NAME="458"></A><BR>Clear through his brain the bitter torment pierced
<A NAME="459"></A><BR>Even to the filmy inner veil thereof;
<A NAME="460"></A><BR>Now bloodshot were his eyes, now ghastly green;
<A NAME="461"></A><BR>Anon with rheum they ran, as pours a stream
<A NAME="462"></A><BR>Down from a rugged crag, with thawing snow
<A NAME="463"></A><BR>Made turbid.  As a man distraught he seemed:
<A NAME="464"></A><BR>All things he saw showed double, and he groaned
<A NAME="465"></A><BR>Fearfully; yet he ceased not to exhort
<A NAME="466"></A><BR>The men of Troy, and recked not of his pain.
<A NAME="467"></A><BR>Then did the Goddess strike him utterly blind.
<A NAME="468"></A><BR>Stared his fixed eyeballs white from pits of blood;
<A NAME="469"></A><BR>And all folk groaned for pity of their friend,
<A NAME="470"></A><BR>And dread of the Prey-giver, lest he had sinned
<A NAME="471"></A><BR>In folly against her, and his mind was thus
<A NAME="472"></A><BR>Warped to destruction yea, lest on themselves
<A NAME="473"></A><BR>Like judgment should be visited, to avenge
<A NAME="474"></A><BR>The outrage done to hapless Sinon's flesh,
<A NAME="475"></A><BR>Whereby they hoped to wring the truth from him.
<A NAME="476"></A><BR>So led they him in friendly wise to Troy,
<A NAME="477"></A><BR>Pitying him at the last.  Then gathered all,
<A NAME="478"></A><BR>And o'er that huge Horse hastily cast a rope,
<A NAME="479"></A><BR>And made it fast above; for under its feet
<A NAME="480"></A><BR>Smooth wooden rollers had Epeius laid,
<A NAME="481"></A><BR>That, dragged by Trojan hands, it might glide on
<A NAME="482"></A><BR>Into their fortress.  One and all they haled
<A NAME="483"></A><BR>With multitudinous tug and strain, as when
<A NAME="484"></A><BR>Down to the sea young men sore-labouring drag
<A NAME="485"></A><BR>A ship; hard-crushed the stubborn rollers groan,
<A NAME="486"></A><BR>As, sliding with weird shrieks, the keel descends
<A NAME="487"></A><BR>Into the sea-surge; so that host with toil
<A NAME="488"></A><BR>Dragged up unto their city their own doom,
<A NAME="489"></A><BR>Epeius' work.  With great festoons of flowers
<A NAME="490"></A><BR>They hung it, and their own heads did they wreathe,
<A NAME="491"></A><BR>While answering each other pealed the flutes.
<A NAME="492"></A><BR>Grimly Enyo laughed, seeing the end
<A NAME="493"></A><BR>Of that dire war; Hera rejoiced on high;
<A NAME="494"></A><BR>Glad was Athena.  When the Trojans came
<A NAME="495"></A><BR>Unto their city, brake they down the walls,
<A NAME="496"></A><BR>Their city's coronal, that the Horse of Death
<A NAME="497"></A><BR>Might be led in.  Troy's daughters greeted it
<A NAME="498"></A><BR>With shouts of salutation; marvelling all
<A NAME="499"></A><BR>Gazed at the mighty work where lurked their doom.
<A NAME="500"></A><BR><BR>But still Laocoon ceased not to exhort
<A NAME="501"></A><BR>His countrymen to burn the Horse with fire:
<A NAME="502"></A><BR>They would not hear, for dread of the Gods' wrath.
<A NAME="503"></A><BR>But then a yet more hideous punishment
<A NAME="504"></A><BR>Athena visited on his hapless sons.
<A NAME="505"></A><BR>A cave there was, beneath a rugged cliff
<A NAME="506"></A><BR>Exceeding high, unscalable, wherein
<A NAME="507"></A><BR>Dwelt fearful monsters of the deadly brood
<A NAME="508"></A><BR>Of Typhon, in the rock-clefts of the isle
<A NAME="509"></A><BR>Calydna that looks Troyward from the sea.
<A NAME="510"></A><BR>Thence stirred she up the strength of serpents twain,
<A NAME="511"></A><BR>And summoned them to Troy.  By her uproused
<A NAME="512"></A><BR>They shook the island as with earthquake: roared
<A NAME="513"></A><BR>The sea; the waves disparted as they came.
<A NAME="514"></A><BR>Onward they swept with fearful-flickering tongues:
<A NAME="515"></A><BR>Shuddered the very monsters of the deep:
<A NAME="516"></A><BR>Xanthus' and Simois' daughters moaned aloud,
<A NAME="517"></A><BR>The River-nymphs: the Cyprian Queen looked down
<A NAME="518"></A><BR>In anguish from Olympus.  Swiftly they came
<A NAME="519"></A><BR>Whither the Goddess sped them: with grim jaws
<A NAME="520"></A><BR>Whetting their deadly fangs, on his hapless sons
<A NAME="521"></A><BR>Sprang they.  All Trojans panic-stricken fled,
<A NAME="522"></A><BR>Seeing those fearsome dragons in their town.
<A NAME="523"></A><BR>No man, though ne'er so dauntless theretofore,
<A NAME="524"></A><BR>Dared tarry; ghastly dread laid hold on all
<A NAME="525"></A><BR>Shrinking in horror from the monsters. Screamed
<A NAME="526"></A><BR>The women; yea, the mother forgat her child,
<A NAME="527"></A><BR>Fear-frenzied as she fled: all Troy became
<A NAME="528"></A><BR>One shriek of fleers, one huddle of jostling limbs:
<A NAME="529"></A><BR>The streets were choked with cowering fugitives.
<A NAME="530"></A><BR>Alone was left Laocoon with his sons,
<A NAME="531"></A><BR>For death's doom and the Goddess chained their feet.
<A NAME="532"></A><BR>Then, even as from destruction shrank the lads,
<A NAME="533"></A><BR>Those deadly fangs had seized and ravined up
<A NAME="534"></A><BR>The twain, outstretching to their sightless sire
<A NAME="535"></A><BR>Agonized hands: no power to help had he.
<A NAME="536"></A><BR>Trojans far off looked on from every side
<A NAME="537"></A><BR>Weeping, all dazed.  And, having now fulfilled
<A NAME="538"></A><BR>Upon the Trojans Pallas' awful hest,
<A NAME="539"></A><BR>Those monsters vanished 'neath the earth; and still
<A NAME="540"></A><BR>Stands their memorial, where into the fane
<A NAME="541"></A><BR>They entered of Apollo in Pergamus
<A NAME="542"></A><BR>The hallowed.  Therebefore the sons of Troy
<A NAME="543"></A><BR>Gathered, and reared a cenotaph for those
<A NAME="544"></A><BR>Who miserably had perished.  Over it
<A NAME="545"></A><BR>Their father from his blind eyes rained the tears:
<A NAME="546"></A><BR>Over the empty tomb their mother shrieked,
<A NAME="547"></A><BR>Boding the while yet worse things, wailing o'er
<A NAME="548"></A><BR>The ruin wrought by folly of her lord,
<A NAME="549"></A><BR>Dreading the anger of the Blessed Ones.
<A NAME="550"></A><BR>As when around her void nest in a brake
<A NAME="551"></A><BR>In sorest anguish moans the nightingale
<A NAME="552"></A><BR>Whose fledglings, ere they learned her plaintive 
<A NAME="553"></A>song,
<A NAME="554"></A><BR>A hideous serpent's fangs have done to death,
<A NAME="555"></A><BR>And left the mother anguish, endless woe,
<A NAME="556"></A><BR>And bootless crying round her desolate home;
<A NAME="557"></A><BR>So groaned she for her children's wretched death,
<A NAME="558"></A><BR>So moaned she o'er the void tomb; and her pangs
<A NAME="559"></A><BR>Were sharpened by her lord's plight stricken blind.
<A NAME="560"></A><BR><BR>While she for children and for husband moaned 
<A NAME="561"></A>--
<A NAME="562"></A><BR>These slain, he of the sun's light portionless --
<A NAME="563"></A><BR>The Trojans to the Immortals sacrificed,
<A NAME="564"></A><BR>Pouring the wine.  Their hearts beat high with hope
<A NAME="565"></A><BR>To escape the weary stress of woeful war.
<A NAME="566"></A><BR>Howbeit the victims burned not, and the flames
<A NAME="567"></A><BR>Died out, as though 'neath heavy-hissing rain;
<A NAME="568"></A><BR>And writhed the smoke-wreaths blood-red, and the 
<A NAME="569"></A>thighs
<A NAME="570"></A><BR>Quivering from crumbling altars fell to earth.
<A NAME="571"></A><BR>Drink-offerings turned to blood, Gods' statues wept,
<A NAME="572"></A><BR>And temple-walls dripped gore: along them rolled
<A NAME="573"></A><BR>Echoes of groaning out of depths unseen;
<A NAME="574"></A><BR>And all the long walls shuddered: from the towers
<A NAME="575"></A><BR>Came quick sharp sounds like cries of men in pain;
<A NAME="576"></A><BR>And, weirdly shrieking, of themselves slid back
<A NAME="577"></A><BR>The gate-bolts.  Screaming "Desolation!" wailed
<A NAME="578"></A><BR>The birds of night.  Above that God-built burg
<A NAME="579"></A><BR>A mist palled every star; and yet no cloud
<A NAME="580"></A><BR>Was in the flashing heavens.  By Phoebus' fane
<A NAME="581"></A><BR>Withered the bays that erst were lush and green.
<A NAME="582"></A><BR>Wolves and foul-feeding jackals came and howled
<A NAME="583"></A><BR>Within the gates.  Ay, other signs untold
<A NAME="584"></A><BR>Appeared, portending woe to Dardanus' sons
<A NAME="585"></A><BR>And Troy: yet no fear touched the Trojans' hearts
<A NAME="586"></A><BR>Who saw all through the town those portents dire:
<A NAME="587"></A><BR>Fate crazed them all, that midst their revelling
<A NAME="588"></A><BR>Slain by their foes they might fill up their doom.
<A NAME="589"></A><BR><BR>One heart was steadfast, and one soul clear-eyed,
<A NAME="590"></A><BR>Cassandra.  Never her words were unfulfilled;
<A NAME="591"></A><BR>Yet was their utter truth, by Fate's decree,
<A NAME="592"></A><BR>Ever as idle wind in the hearers' ears,
<A NAME="593"></A><BR>That no bar to Troy's ruin might be set.
<A NAME="594"></A><BR>She saw those evil portents all through Troy
<A NAME="595"></A><BR>Conspiring to one end; loud rang her cry,
<A NAME="596"></A><BR>As roars a lioness that mid the brakes
<A NAME="597"></A><BR>A hunter has stabbed or shot, whereat her heart
<A NAME="598"></A><BR>Maddens, and down the long hills rolls her roar,
<A NAME="599"></A><BR>And her might waxes tenfold; so with heart
<A NAME="600"></A><BR>Aflame with prophecy came she forth her bower.
<A NAME="601"></A><BR>Over her snowy shoulders tossed her hair
<A NAME="602"></A><BR>Streaming far down, and wildly blazed her eyes.
<A NAME="603"></A><BR>Her neck writhed, like a sapling in the wind
<A NAME="604"></A><BR>Shaken, as moaned and shrieked that noble maid:
<A NAME="605"></A><BR>"O wretches!  into the Land of Darkness now
<A NAME="606"></A><BR>We are passing; for all round us full of fire
<A NAME="607"></A><BR>And blood and dismal moan the city is.
<A NAME="608"></A><BR>Everywhere portents of calamity
<A NAME="609"></A><BR>Gods show: destruction yawns before your feet.
<A NAME="610"></A><BR>Fools!  ye know not your doom: still ye rejoice
<A NAME="611"></A><BR>With one consent in madness, who to Troy
<A NAME="612"></A><BR>Have brought the Argive Horse where ruin lurks!
<A NAME="613"></A><BR>Oh, ye believe not me, though ne'er so loud
<A NAME="614"></A><BR>I cry!  The Erinyes and the ruthless Fates,
<A NAME="615"></A><BR>For Helen's spousals madly wroth, through Troy
<A NAME="616"></A><BR>Dart on wild wings.  And ye, ye are banqueting there
<A NAME="617"></A><BR>In your last feast, on meats befouled with gore,
<A NAME="618"></A><BR>When now your feet are on the Path of Ghosts!"
<A NAME="619"></A><BR><BR>Then cried a scoffing voice an ominous word:
<A NAME="620"></A><BR>"Why doth a raving tongue of evil speech,
<A NAME="621"></A><BR>Daughter of Priam, make thy lips to cry
<A NAME="622"></A><BR>Words empty as wind?  No maiden modesty
<A NAME="623"></A><BR>With purity veils thee: thou art compassed round
<A NAME="624"></A><BR>With ruinous madness; therefore all men scorn
<A NAME="625"></A><BR>Thee, babbler!  Hence, thine evil bodings speak
<A NAME="626"></A><BR>To the Argives and thyself!  For thee doth wait
<A NAME="627"></A><BR>Anguish and shame yet bitterer than befell
<A NAME="628"></A><BR>Presumptuous Laocoon.  Shame it were
<A NAME="629"></A><BR>In folly to destroy the Immortals' gift."
<A NAME="630"></A><BR><BR>So scoffed a Trojan: others in like sort
<A NAME="631"></A><BR>Cried shame on her, and said she spake but lies,
<A NAME="632"></A><BR>Saying that ruin and Fate's heavy stroke
<A NAME="633"></A><BR>Were hard at hand.  They knew not their own doom,
<A NAME="634"></A><BR>And mocked, and thrust her back from that huge Horse 
<A NAME="635"></A>\u00fa
<A NAME="636"></A><BR>For fain she was to smite its beams apart,
<A NAME="637"></A><BR>Or burn with ravening fire.  She snatched a brand
<A NAME="638"></A><BR>Of blazing pine-wood from the hearth and ran
<A NAME="639"></A><BR>In fury: in the other hand she bare
<A NAME="640"></A><BR>A two-edged halberd: on that Horse of Doom
<A NAME="641"></A><BR>She rushed, to cause the Trojans to behold
<A NAME="642"></A><BR>With their own eyes the ambush hidden there.
<A NAME="643"></A><BR>But straightway from her hands they plucked and 
<A NAME="644"></A>flung
<A NAME="645"></A><BR>Afar the fire and steel, and careless turned
<A NAME="646"></A><BR>To the feast; for darkened o'er them their last 
<A NAME="647"></A>night.
<A NAME="648"></A><BR>Within the horse the Argives joyed to hear
<A NAME="649"></A><BR>The uproar of Troy's feasters setting at naught
<A NAME="650"></A><BR>Cassandra, but they marvelled that she knew
<A NAME="651"></A><BR>So well the Achaeans' purpose and device.
<A NAME="652"></A><BR><BR>As mid the hills a furious pantheress,
<A NAME="653"></A><BR>Which from the steading hounds and shepherd-folk
<A NAME="654"></A><BR>Drive with fierce rush, with savage heart turns 
<A NAME="655"></A>back
<A NAME="656"></A><BR>Even in departing, galled albeit by darts:
<A NAME="657"></A><BR>So from the great Horse fled she, anguish-racked
<A NAME="658"></A><BR>For Troy, for all the ruin she foreknew.
