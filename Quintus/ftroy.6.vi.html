<A NAME="10"></A><B>How Came for the Helping of Troy Eurypylus, Hercules' 
<A NAME="11"></A>Grandson</B>
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="12"></A>Rose Dawn from Ocean and Tithonus' bed,
<A NAME="13"></A><BR>And climbed the steeps of heaven, scattering round
<A NAME="14"></A><BR>Flushed flakes of splendour; laughed all earth and 
<A NAME="15"></A>air.
<A NAME="16"></A><BR>Then turned unto their labours, each to each,
<A NAME="17"></A><BR>Mortals, frail creatures daily dying.  Then
<A NAME="18"></A><BR>Streamed to a folkmote all the Achaean men
<A NAME="19"></A><BR>At Menelaus' summons.  When the host
<A NAME="20"></A><BR>Were gathered all, then in their midst he spake:
<A NAME="21"></A><BR>"Hearken my words, ye god-descended kings:
<A NAME="22"></A><BR>Mine heart within my breast is burdened sore
<A NAME="23"></A><BR>For men which perish, men that for my sake
<A NAME="24"></A><BR>Came to the bitter war, whose home-return
<A NAME="25"></A><BR>Parents and home shall welcome nevermore;
<A NAME="26"></A><BR>For Fate hath cut off thousands in their prime.
<A NAME="27"></A><BR>Oh that the heavy hand of death had fallen
<A NAME="28"></A><BR>On me, ere hitherward I gathered these!
<A NAME="29"></A><BR>But now hath God laid on me cureless pain
<A NAME="30"></A><BR>In seeing all these ills.  Who could rejoice
<A NAME="31"></A><BR>Beholding strivings, struggles of despair?
<A NAME="32"></A><BR>Come, let us, which be yet alive, in haste
<A NAME="33"></A><BR>Flee in the ships, each to his several land,
<A NAME="34"></A><BR>Since Aias and Achilles both are dead.
<A NAME="35"></A><BR>I look not, now they are slain, that we the rest
<A NAME="36"></A><BR>Shall 'scape destruction; nay, but we shall fall
<A NAME="37"></A><BR>Before yon terrible Trojans for my sake
<A NAME="38"></A><BR>And shameless Helen's!  Think not that I care
<A NAME="39"></A><BR>For her: for you I care, when I behold
<A NAME="40"></A><BR>Good men in battle slain.  Away with her --
<A NAME="41"></A><BR>Her and her paltry paramour!  The Gods
<A NAME="42"></A><BR>Stole all discretion out of her false heart
<A NAME="43"></A><BR>When she forsook mine home and marriage-bed.
<A NAME="44"></A><BR>Let Priam and the Trojans cherish her!
<A NAME="45"></A><BR>But let us straight return: 'twere better far
<A NAME="46"></A><BR>To flee from dolorous war than perish all."
<A NAME="47"></A><BR><BR>So spake he but to try the Argive men.
<A NAME="48"></A><BR>Far other thoughts than these made his heart burn
<A NAME="49"></A><BR>With passionate desire to slay his foes,
<A NAME="50"></A><BR>To break the long walls of their city down
<A NAME="51"></A><BR>From their foundations, and to glut with blood
<A NAME="52"></A><BR>Ares, when Paris mid the slain should fall.
<A NAME="53"></A><BR>Fiercer is naught than passionate desire!
<A NAME="54"></A><BR>Thus as he pondered, sitting in his place,
<A NAME="55"></A><BR>Uprose Tydeides, shaker of the shield,
<A NAME="56"></A><BR>And chode in fiery speech with Menelaus:
<A NAME="57"></A><BR>"O coward Atreus' son, what craven fear
<A NAME="58"></A><BR>Hath gripped thee, that thou speakest so to us
<A NAME="59"></A><BR>As might a weakling child or woman speak?
<A NAME="60"></A><BR>Not unto thee Achaea's noblest sons
<A NAME="61"></A><BR>Will hearken, ere Troy's coronal of towers
<A NAME="62"></A><BR>Be wholly dashed to the dust: for unto men
<A NAME="63"></A><BR>Valour is high renown, and flight is shame!
<A NAME="64"></A><BR>If any man shall hearken to the words
<A NAME="65"></A><BR>Of this thy counsel, I will smite from him
<A NAME="66"></A><BR>His head with sharp blue steel, and hurl it down
<A NAME="67"></A><BR>For soaring kites to feast on.  Up!  all ye
<A NAME="68"></A><BR>Who care to enkindle men to battle: rouse
<A NAME="69"></A><BR>Our warriors all throughout the fleet to whet
<A NAME="70"></A><BR>The spear, to burnish corslet, helm and shield;
<A NAME="71"></A><BR>And cause both man and horse, all which be keen
<A NAME="72"></A><BR>In fight, to break their fast.  Then in yon plain
<A NAME="73"></A><BR>Who is the stronger Ares shall decide."
<A NAME="74"></A><BR><BR>So speaking, in his place he sat him down;
<A NAME="75"></A><BR>Then rose up Thestor's son, and in the midst,
<A NAME="76"></A><BR>Where meet it is to speak, stood forth and cried:
<A NAME="77"></A><BR>"Hear me, ye sons of battle-biding Greeks:
<A NAME="78"></A><BR>Ye know I have the spirit of prophecy.
<A NAME="79"></A><BR>Erewhile I said that ye in the tenth year
<A NAME="80"></A><BR>Should lay waste towered Ilium: this the Gods
<A NAME="81"></A><BR>Are even now fulfilling; victory lies
<A NAME="82"></A><BR>At the Argives' very feet.  Come, let us send
<A NAME="83"></A><BR>Tydeides and Odysseus battle-staunch
<A NAME="84"></A><BR>With speed to Scyros overseas, by prayers
<A NAME="85"></A><BR>Hither to bring Achilles' hero son:
<A NAME="86"></A><BR>A light of victory shall he be to us."
<A NAME="87"></A><BR><BR>So spake wise Thestius' son, and all the folk
<A NAME="88"></A><BR>Shouted for joy; for all their hearts and hopes
<A NAME="89"></A><BR>Yearned to see Calchas' prophecy fulfilled.
<A NAME="90"></A><BR>Then to the Argives spake Laertes' son:
<A NAME="91"></A><BR>"Friends, it befits not to say many words
<A NAME="92"></A><BR>This day to you, in sorrow's weariness.
<A NAME="93"></A><BR>I know that wearied men can find no joy
<A NAME="94"></A><BR>In speech or song, though the Pierides,
<A NAME="95"></A><BR>The immortal Muses, love it.  At such time
<A NAME="96"></A><BR>Few words do men desire.  But now, this thing
<A NAME="97"></A><BR>That pleaseth all the Achaean host, will I
<A NAME="98"></A><BR>Accomplish, so Tydeides fare with me;
<A NAME="99"></A><BR>For, if we twain go, we shall surely bring,
<A NAME="100"></A><BR>Won by our words, war-fain Achilles' son,
<A NAME="101"></A><BR>Yea, though his mother, weeping sore, should strive
<A NAME="102"></A><BR>Within her halls to keep him; for mine heart
<A NAME="103"></A><BR>Trusts that he is a hero's valorous son."
<A NAME="104"></A><BR><BR>Then out spake Menelaus earnestly:
<A NAME="105"></A><BR>"Odysseus, the strong Argives' help at need,
<A NAME="106"></A><BR>If mighty-souled Achilles' valiant son
<A NAME="107"></A><BR>From Scyros by thy suasion come to aid
<A NAME="108"></A><BR>Us who yearn for him, and some Heavenly One
<A NAME="109"></A><BR>Grant victory to our prayers, and I win home
<A NAME="110"></A><BR>To Hellas, I will give to him to wife
<A NAME="111"></A><BR>My noble child Hermione, with gifts
<A NAME="112"></A><BR>Many and goodly for her marriage-dower
<A NAME="113"></A><BR>With a glad heart.  I trow he shall not scorn
<A NAME="114"></A><BR>Either his bride or high-born sire-in-law."
<A NAME="115"></A><BR><BR>With a great shout the Danaans hailed his words.
<A NAME="116"></A><BR>Then was the throng dispersed, and to the ships
<A NAME="117"></A><BR>They scattered hungering for the morning meat
<A NAME="118"></A><BR>Which strengtheneth man's heart.  So when they ceased
<A NAME="119"></A><BR>From eating, and desire was satisfied,
<A NAME="120"></A><BR>Then with the wise Odysseus Tydeus' son
<A NAME="121"></A><BR>Drew down a swift ship to the boundless sea,
<A NAME="122"></A><BR>And victual and all tackling cast therein.
<A NAME="123"></A><BR>Then stepped they aboard, and with them twenty men,
<A NAME="124"></A><BR>Men skilled to row when winds were contrary,
<A NAME="125"></A><BR>Or when the unrippled sea slept 'neath a calm.
<A NAME="126"></A><BR>They smote the brine, and flashed the boiling foam:
<A NAME="127"></A><BR>On leapt the ship; a watery way was cleft
<A NAME="128"></A><BR>About the oars that sweating rowers tugged.
<A NAME="129"></A><BR>As when hard-toiling oxen, 'neath the yoke
<A NAME="130"></A><BR>Straining, drag on a massy-timbered wain,
<A NAME="131"></A><BR>While creaks the circling axle 'neath its load,
<A NAME="132"></A><BR>And from their weary necks and shoulders streams
<A NAME="133"></A><BR>Down to the ground the sweat abundantly;
<A NAME="134"></A><BR>So at the stiff oars toiled those stalwart men,
<A NAME="135"></A><BR>And fast they laid behind them leagues of sea.
<A NAME="136"></A><BR>Gazed after them the Achaeans as they went,
<A NAME="137"></A><BR>Then turned to whet their deadly darts and spears,
<A NAME="138"></A><BR>The weapons of their warfare.  In their town
<A NAME="139"></A><BR>The aweless Trojans armed themselves the while
<A NAME="140"></A><BR>War-eager, praying to the Gods to grant
<A NAME="141"></A><BR>Respite from slaughter, breathing-space from toil.
<A NAME="142"></A><BR><BR>To these, while sorely thus they yearned, the 
<A NAME="143"></A>Gods
<A NAME="144"></A><BR>Brought present help in trouble, even the seed
<A NAME="145"></A><BR>Of mighty Hercules, Eurypylus.
<A NAME="146"></A><BR>A great host followed him, in battle skilled,
<A NAME="147"></A><BR>All that by long Caicus' outflow dwelt,
<A NAME="148"></A><BR>Full of triumphant trust in their strong spears.
<A NAME="149"></A><BR>Round them rejoicing thronged the sons of Troy:
<A NAME="150"></A><BR>As when tame geese within a pen gaze up
<A NAME="151"></A><BR>On him who casts them corn, and round his feet
<A NAME="152"></A><BR>Throng hissing uncouth love, and his heart warms
<A NAME="153"></A><BR>As he looks down on them; so thronged the sons
<A NAME="154"></A><BR>Of Troy, as on fierce-heart Eurypylus
<A NAME="155"></A><BR>They gazed; and gladdened was his aweless soul
<A NAME="156"></A><BR>To see those throngs: from porchways women looked
<A NAME="157"></A><BR>Wide-eyed with wonder on the godlike man.
<A NAME="158"></A><BR>Above all men he towered as on he strode,
<A NAME="159"></A><BR>As looks a lion when amid the hills
<A NAME="160"></A><BR>He comes on jackals.  Paris welcomed him,
<A NAME="161"></A><BR>As Hector honouring him, his cousin he,
<A NAME="162"></A><BR>Being of one blood with him, who was born Of
<A NAME="163"></A><BR>Astyoche, King Priam's sister fair
<A NAME="164"></A><BR>Whom Telephus embraced in his strong arms,
<A NAME="165"></A><BR>Telephus, whom to aweless Hercules
<A NAME="166"></A><BR>Auge the bright-haired bare in secret love.
<A NAME="167"></A><BR>That babe, a suckling craving for the breast,
<A NAME="168"></A><BR>A swift hind fostered, giving him the teat
<A NAME="169"></A><BR>As to her own fawn in all love; for Zeus
<A NAME="170"></A><BR>So willed it, in whose eyes it was not meet
<A NAME="171"></A><BR>That Hercules' child should perish wretchedly.
<A NAME="172"></A><BR>His glorious son with glad heart Paris led
<A NAME="173"></A><BR>Unto his palace through the wide-wayed burg
<A NAME="174"></A><BR>Beside Assaracus' tomb and stately halls
<A NAME="175"></A><BR>Of Hector, and Tritonis' holy fane.
<A NAME="176"></A><BR>Hard by his mansion stood, and therebeside
<A NAME="177"></A><BR>The stainless altar of Home-warder Zeus
<A NAME="178"></A><BR>Rose.  As they went, he lovingly questioned him
<A NAME="179"></A><BR>Of brethren, parents, and of marriage-kin;
<A NAME="180"></A><BR>And all he craved to know Eurypylus told.
<A NAME="181"></A><BR>So communed they, on-pacing side by side.
<A NAME="182"></A><BR>Then came they to a palace great and rich:
<A NAME="183"></A><BR>There goddess-like sat Helen, clothed upon
<A NAME="184"></A><BR>With beauty of the Graces.  Maidens four
<A NAME="185"></A><BR>About her plied their tasks: others apart
<A NAME="186"></A><BR>Within that goodly bower wrought the works
<A NAME="187"></A><BR>Beseeming handmaids.  Helen marvelling gazed
<A NAME="188"></A><BR>Upon Eurypylus, on Helen he.
<A NAME="189"></A><BR>Then these in converse each with other spake
<A NAME="190"></A><BR>In that all-odorous bower.  The handmaids brought
<A NAME="191"></A><BR>And set beside their lady high-seats twain;
<A NAME="192"></A><BR>And Paris sat him down, and at his side
<A NAME="193"></A><BR>Eurypylus.  That hero's host encamped
<A NAME="194"></A><BR>Without the city, where the Trojan guards
<A NAME="195"></A><BR>Kept watch.  Their armour laid they on the earth;
<A NAME="196"></A><BR>Their steeds, yet breathing battle, stood thereby,
<A NAME="197"></A><BR>And cribs were heaped with horses' provender.
<A NAME="198"></A><BR><BR>Upfloated night, and darkened earth and air;
<A NAME="199"></A><BR>Then feasted they before that cliff-like wall,
<A NAME="200"></A><BR>Ceteian men and Trojans: babel of talk
<A NAME="201"></A><BR>Rose from the feasters: all around the glow
<A NAME="202"></A><BR>Of blazing campfires lighted up the tents:
<A NAME="203"></A><BR>Pealed out the pipe's sweet voice, and hautboys 
<A NAME="204"></A>rang
<A NAME="205"></A><BR>With their clear-shrilling reeds; the witching strain
<A NAME="206"></A><BR>Of lyres was rippling round.  From far away
<A NAME="207"></A><BR>The Argives gazed and marvelled, seeing the plain
<A NAME="208"></A><BR>Aglare with many fires, and hearing notes
<A NAME="209"></A><BR>Of flutes and lyres, neighing of chariot-steeds
<A NAME="210"></A><BR>And pipes, the shepherd's and the banquet's joy.
<A NAME="211"></A><BR>Therefore they bade their fellows each in turn
<A NAME="212"></A><BR>Keep watch and ward about the tents till dawn,
<A NAME="213"></A><BR>Lest those proud Trojans feasting by their walls
<A NAME="214"></A><BR>Should fall on them, and set the ships aflame.
<A NAME="215"></A><BR><BR>Within the halls of Paris all this while
<A NAME="216"></A><BR>With kings and princes Telephus' hero son
<A NAME="217"></A><BR>Feasted; and Priam and the sons of Troy
<A NAME="218"></A><BR>Each after each prayed him to play the man
<A NAME="219"></A><BR>Against the Argives, and in bitter doom
<A NAME="220"></A><BR>To lay them low; and blithe he promised all.
<A NAME="221"></A><BR>So when they had supped, each hied him to his home;
<A NAME="222"></A><BR>But there Eurypylus laid him down to rest
<A NAME="223"></A><BR>Full nigh the feast-hall, in the stately bower
<A NAME="224"></A><BR>Where Paris theretofore himself had slept
<A NAME="225"></A><BR>With Helen world-renowned.  A bower it was
<A NAME="226"></A><BR>Most wondrous fair, the goodliest of them all.
<A NAME="227"></A><BR>There lay he down; but otherwhere their rest
<A NAME="228"></A><BR>Took they, till rose the bright-throned Queen of 
<A NAME="229"></A>Morn.
<A NAME="230"></A><BR>Up sprang with dawn the son of Telephus,
<A NAME="231"></A><BR>And passed to the host with all those other kings
<A NAME="232"></A><BR>In Troy abiding.  Straightway did the folk
<A NAME="233"></A><BR>All battle-eager don their warrior-gear,
<A NAME="234"></A><BR>Burning to strike in forefront of the fight.
<A NAME="235"></A><BR>And now Eurypylus clad his mighty limbs
<A NAME="236"></A><BR>In armour that like levin-flashes gleamed;
<A NAME="237"></A><BR>Upon his shield by cunning hands were wrought
<A NAME="238"></A><BR>All the great labours of strong Hercules.
<A NAME="239"></A><BR><BR>Thereon were seen two serpents flickering
<A NAME="240"></A><BR>Black tongues from grimly jaws: they seemed in act
<A NAME="241"></A><BR>To dart; but Hercules' hands to right and left --
<A NAME="242"></A><BR>Albeit a babe's hands -- now were throttling them;
<A NAME="243"></A><BR>For aweless was his spirit.  As Zeus' strength
<A NAME="244"></A><BR>From the beginning was his strength.  The seed
<A NAME="245"></A><BR>Of Heaven-abiders never deedless is
<A NAME="246"></A><BR>Nor helpless, but hath boundless prowess, yea,
<A NAME="247"></A><BR>Even when in the womb unborn it lies.
<A NAME="248"></A><BR><BR>Nemea's mighty lion there was seen
<A NAME="249"></A><BR>Strangled in the strong arms of Hercules,
<A NAME="250"></A><BR>His grim jaws dashed about with bloody foam:
<A NAME="251"></A><BR>He seemed in verity gasping out his life.
<A NAME="252"></A><BR><BR>Thereby was wrought the Hydra many-necked
<A NAME="253"></A><BR>Flickering its dread tongues.  Of its fearful heads
<A NAME="254"></A><BR>Some severed lay on earth, but many more
<A NAME="255"></A><BR>Were budding from its necks, while Hercules
<A NAME="256"></A><BR>And Iolaus, dauntless-hearted twain,
<A NAME="257"></A><BR>Toiled hard; the one with lightning sickle-sweeps
<A NAME="258"></A><BR>Lopped the fierce heads, his fellow seared each 
<A NAME="259"></A>neck
<A NAME="260"></A><BR>With glowing iron; the monster so was slain.
<A NAME="261"></A><BR><BR>Thereby was wrought the mighty tameless Boar
<A NAME="262"></A><BR>With foaming jaws; real seemed the pictured thing,
<A NAME="263"></A><BR>As by Aleides' giant strength the brute
<A NAME="264"></A><BR>Was to Eurystheus living borne on high.
<A NAME="265"></A><BR><BR>There fashioned was the fleetfoot stag which 
<A NAME="266"></A>laid
<A NAME="267"></A><BR>The vineyards waste of hapless husbandmen.
<A NAME="268"></A><BR>The Hero's hands held fast its golden horns,
<A NAME="269"></A><BR>The while it snorted breath of ravening fire.
<A NAME="270"></A><BR><BR>Thereon were seen the fierce Stymphalian Birds,
<A NAME="271"></A><BR>Some arrow-smitten dying in the dust,
<A NAME="272"></A><BR>Some through the grey air darting in swift flight.
<A NAME="273"></A><BR>At this, at that one -- hot in haste he seemed --
<A NAME="274"></A><BR>Hercules sped the arrows of his wrath.
<A NAME="275"></A><BR><BR>Augeias' monstrous stable there was wrought
<A NAME="276"></A><BR>With cunning craft on that invincible targe;
<A NAME="277"></A><BR>And Hercules was turning through the same
<A NAME="278"></A><BR>The deep flow of Alpheius' stream divine,
<A NAME="279"></A><BR>While wondering Nymphs looked down on every hand
<A NAME="280"></A><BR>Upon that mighty work.  Elsewhere portrayed
<A NAME="281"></A><BR>Was the Fire-breathing Bull: the Hero's grip
<A NAME="282"></A><BR>On his strong horns wrenched round the massive neck:
<A NAME="283"></A><BR>The straining muscles on his arm stood out:
<A NAME="284"></A><BR>The huge beast seemed to bellow.  Next thereto
<A NAME="285"></A><BR>Wrought on the shield was one in beauty arrayed
<A NAME="286"></A><BR>As of a Goddess, even Hippolyta.
<A NAME="287"></A><BR>The hero by the hair was dragging her
<A NAME="288"></A><BR>From her swift steed, with fierce resolve to wrest
<A NAME="289"></A><BR>With his strong hands the Girdle Marvellous
<A NAME="290"></A><BR>From the Amazon Queen, while quailing shrank away
<A NAME="291"></A><BR>The Maids of War.  There in the Thracian land
<A NAME="292"></A><BR>Were Diomedes' grim man-eating steeds:
<A NAME="293"></A><BR>These at their gruesome mangers had he slain,
<A NAME="294"></A><BR>And dead they lay with their fiend-hearted lord.
<A NAME="295"></A><BR><BR>There lay the bulk of giant Geryon
<A NAME="296"></A><BR>Dead mid his kine.  His gory heads were cast
<A NAME="297"></A><BR>In dust, dashed down by that resistless club.
<A NAME="298"></A><BR>Before him slain lay that most murderous hound
<A NAME="299"></A><BR>Orthros, in furious might like Cerberus
<A NAME="300"></A><BR>His brother-hound: a herdman lay thereby,
<A NAME="301"></A><BR>Eurytion, all bedabbled with his blood.
<A NAME="302"></A><BR><BR>There were the Golden Apples wrought, that gleamed
<A NAME="303"></A><BR>In the Hesperides' garden undefiled:
<A NAME="304"></A><BR>All round the fearful Serpent's dead coils lay,
<A NAME="305"></A><BR>And shrank the Maids aghast from Zeus' bold son.
<A NAME="306"></A><BR><BR>And there, a dread sight even for Gods to see,
<A NAME="307"></A><BR>Was Cerberus, whom the Loathly Worm had borne
<A NAME="308"></A><BR>To Typho in a craggy cavern's gloom
<A NAME="309"></A><BR>Close on the borders of Eternal Night,
<A NAME="310"></A><BR>A hideous monster, warder of the Gate
<A NAME="311"></A><BR>Of Hades, Home of Wailing, jailer-hound
<A NAME="312"></A><BR>Of dead folk in the shadowy Gulf of Doom.
<A NAME="313"></A><BR>But lightly Zeus' son with his crashing blows
<A NAME="314"></A><BR>Tamed him, and haled him from the cataract flood
<A NAME="315"></A><BR>Of Styx, with heavy-drooping head, and dragged
<A NAME="316"></A><BR>The Dog sore loth to the strange upper air
<A NAME="317"></A><BR>All dauntlessly.  And there, at the world's end,
<A NAME="318"></A><BR>Were Caucasus' long glens, where Hercules,
<A NAME="319"></A><BR>Rending Prometheus' chains, and hurling them
<A NAME="320"></A><BR>This way and that with fragments of the rock
<A NAME="321"></A><BR>Whereinto they were riveted, set free
<A NAME="322"></A><BR>The mighty Titan.  Arrow-smitten lay
<A NAME="323"></A><BR>The Eagle of the Torment therebeside.
<A NAME="324"></A><BR><BR>There stormed the wild rout of the Centaurs 
<A NAME="325"></A>round
<A NAME="326"></A><BR>The hall of Pholus: goaded on by Strife
<A NAME="327"></A><BR>And wine, with Hercules the monsters fought.
<A NAME="328"></A><BR>Amidst the pine-trunks stricken to death they lay
<A NAME="329"></A><BR>Still grasping those strange weapons in dead hands,
<A NAME="330"></A><BR>While some with stems long-shafted still fought 
<A NAME="331"></A>on
<A NAME="332"></A><BR>In fury, and refrained not from the strife;
<A NAME="333"></A><BR>And all their heads, gashed in the pitiless fight,
<A NAME="334"></A><BR>Were drenched with gore -- the whole scene seemed to live 
<A NAME="335"></A>--
<A NAME="336"></A><BR>With blood the wine was mingled: meats and bowls
<A NAME="337"></A><BR>And tables in one ruin shattered lay.
<A NAME="338"></A><BR><BR>There by Evenus' torrent, in fierce wrath
<A NAME="339"></A><BR>For his sweet bride, he laid with the arrow low
<A NAME="340"></A><BR>Nessus in mid-flight.  There withal was wrought
<A NAME="341"></A><BR>Antaeus' brawny strength, who challenged him
<A NAME="342"></A><BR>To wrestling-strife; he in those sinewy arms
<A NAME="343"></A><BR>Raised high above the earth, was crushed to death.
<A NAME="344"></A><BR><BR>There where swift Hellespont meets the outer 
<A NAME="345"></A>sea,
<A NAME="346"></A><BR>Lay the sea-monster slain by his ruthless shafts,
<A NAME="347"></A><BR>While from Hesione he rent her chains.
<A NAME="348"></A><BR><BR>Of bold Alcides many a deed beside
<A NAME="349"></A><BR>Shone on the broad shield of Eurypylus.
<A NAME="350"></A><BR>He seemed the War-god, as from rank to rank
<A NAME="351"></A><BR>He sped; rejoiced the Trojans following him,
<A NAME="352"></A><BR>Seeing his arms, and him clothed with the might
<A NAME="353"></A><BR>Of Gods; and Paris hailed him to the fray:
<A NAME="354"></A><BR>"Glad am I for thy coming, for mine heart
<A NAME="355"></A><BR>Trusts that the Argives all shall wretchedly
<A NAME="356"></A><BR>Be with their ships destroyed; for such a man
<A NAME="357"></A><BR>Mid Greeks or Trojans never have I seen.
<A NAME="358"></A><BR>Now, by the strength and fury of Hercules --
<A NAME="359"></A><BR>To whom in stature, might, and goodlihead
<A NAME="360"></A><BR>Most like thou art I pray thee, have in mind
<A NAME="361"></A><BR>Him, and resolve to match his deeds with thine.
<A NAME="362"></A><BR>Be the strong shield of Trojans hard-bestead:
<A NAME="363"></A><BR>Win us a breathing-space.  Thou only, I trow,
<A NAME="364"></A><BR>From perishing Troy canst thrust the dark doom back."
<A NAME="365"></A><BR><BR>With kindling words he spake.  That hero cried:
<A NAME="366"></A><BR>"Great-hearted Paris, like the Blessed Ones
<A NAME="367"></A><BR>In goodlihead, this lieth foreordained
<A NAME="368"></A><BR>On the Gods' knees, who in the fight shall fall,
<A NAME="369"></A><BR>And who outlive it.  I, as honour bids,
<A NAME="370"></A><BR>And as my strength sufficeth, will not flinch
<A NAME="371"></A><BR>From Troy's defence.  I swear to turn from fight
<A NAME="372"></A><BR>Never, except in victory or death."
<A NAME="373"></A><BR><BR>Gallantly spake he: with exceeding joy
<A NAME="374"></A><BR>Rejoiced the Trojans.  Champions then he chose,
<A NAME="375"></A><BR>Alexander and Aeneas fiery-souled,
<A NAME="376"></A><BR>Polydamas, Pammon, and Deiphobus,
<A NAME="377"></A><BR>And Aethicus, of Paphlagonian men
<A NAME="378"></A><BR>The staunchest man to stem the tide of war;
<A NAME="379"></A><BR>These chose he, cunning all in battle-toil,
<A NAME="380"></A><BR>To meet the foe in forefront of the fight.
<A NAME="381"></A><BR>Swiftly they strode before that warrior-throng
<A NAME="382"></A><BR>Then from the city cheering charged.  The host
<A NAME="383"></A><BR>Followed them in their thousands, as when bees
<A NAME="384"></A><BR>Follow by bands their leaders from the hives,
<A NAME="385"></A><BR>With loud hum on a spring day pouring forth.
<A NAME="386"></A><BR>So to the fight the warriors followed these;
<A NAME="387"></A><BR>And, as they charged, the thunder-tramp of men
<A NAME="388"></A><BR>And steeds, and clang of armour, rang to heaven.
<A NAME="389"></A><BR>As when a rushing mighty wind stirs up
<A NAME="390"></A><BR>The barren sea-plain from its nethermost floor,
<A NAME="391"></A><BR>And darkling to the strand roll roaring waves
<A NAME="392"></A><BR>Belching sea-tangle from the bursting surf,
<A NAME="393"></A><BR>And wild sounds rise from beaches harvestless;
<A NAME="394"></A><BR>So, as they charged, the wide earth rang again.
<A NAME="395"></A><BR><BR>Now from their rampart forth the Argives poured
<A NAME="396"></A><BR>Round godlike Agamemnon.  Rang their shouts
<A NAME="397"></A><BR>Cheering each other on to face the fight,
<A NAME="398"></A><BR>And not to cower beside the ships in dread
<A NAME="399"></A><BR>Of onset-shouts of battle-eager foes.
<A NAME="400"></A><BR>They met those charging hosts with hearts as light
<A NAME="401"></A><BR>As calves bear, when they leap to meet the kine
<A NAME="402"></A><BR>Down faring from hill-pastures in the spring
<A NAME="403"></A><BR>Unto the steading, when the fields are green
<A NAME="404"></A><BR>With corn-blades, when the earth is glad with flowers,
<A NAME="405"></A><BR>And bowls are brimmed with milk of kine and ewes,
<A NAME="406"></A><BR>And multitudinous lowing far and near
<A NAME="407"></A><BR>Uprises as the mothers meet their young,
<A NAME="408"></A><BR>And in their midst the herdman joys; so great
<A NAME="409"></A><BR>Was the uproar that rose when met the fronts
<A NAME="410"></A><BR>Of battle: dread it rang on either hand.
<A NAME="411"></A><BR>Hard-strained was then the fight: incarnate
<A NAME="412"></A><BR>Strife Stalked through the midst, with Slaughter 
<A NAME="413"></A>ghastly-faced.
<A NAME="414"></A><BR>Crashed bull-hide shields, and spears, and helmet-crests
<A NAME="415"></A><BR>Meeting: the brass flashed out like leaping flames.
<A NAME="416"></A><BR>Bristled the battle with the lances; earth
<A NAME="417"></A><BR>Ran red with blood, as slaughtered heroes fell
<A NAME="418"></A><BR>And horses, mid a tangle of shattered ears,
<A NAME="419"></A><BR>Some yet with spear-wounds gasping, while on them
<A NAME="420"></A><BR>Others were falling.  Through the air upshrieked
<A NAME="421"></A><BR>An awful indistinguishable roar;
<A NAME="422"></A><BR>For on both hosts fell iron-hearted Strife.
<A NAME="423"></A><BR>Here were men hurling cruel jagged stones,
<A NAME="424"></A><BR>There speeding arrows and new-whetted darts,
<A NAME="425"></A><BR>There with the axe or twibill hewing hard,
<A NAME="426"></A><BR>Slashing with swords, and thrusting out with spears:
<A NAME="427"></A><BR>Their mad hands clutched all manner of tools of 
<A NAME="428"></A>death.
<A NAME="429"></A><BR><BR>At first the Argives bore the ranks of Troy
<A NAME="430"></A><BR>Backward a little; but they rallied, charged,
<A NAME="431"></A><BR>Leapt on the foe, and drenched the field with blood.
<A NAME="432"></A><BR>Like a black hurricane rushed Eurypylus
<A NAME="433"></A><BR>Cheering his men on, hewing Argives down
<A NAME="434"></A><BR>Awelessly: measureless might was lent to him
<A NAME="435"></A><BR>By Zeus, for a grace to glorious Hercules.
<A NAME="436"></A><BR>Nireus, a man in beauty like the Gods,
<A NAME="437"></A><BR>His spear long-shafted stabbed beneath the ribs,
<A NAME="438"></A><BR>Down on the plain he fell, forth streamed the blood
<A NAME="439"></A><BR>Drenching his splendid arms, drenching the form
<A NAME="440"></A><BR>Glorious of mould, and his thick-clustering hair.
<A NAME="441"></A><BR>There mid the slain in dust and blood he lay,
<A NAME="442"></A><BR>Like a young lusty olive-sapling, which
<A NAME="443"></A><BR>A river rushing down in roaring flood,
<A NAME="444"></A><BR>Tearing its banks away, and cleaving wide
<A NAME="445"></A><BR>A chasm-channel, hath disrooted; low
<A NAME="446"></A><BR>It lieth heavy-blossomed; so lay then
<A NAME="447"></A><BR>The goodly form, the grace of loveliness
<A NAME="448"></A><BR>Of Nireus on earth's breast.  But o'er the slain
<A NAME="449"></A><BR>Loud rang the taunting of Eurypylus:
<A NAME="450"></A><BR>"Lie there in dust!  Thy beauty marvellous
<A NAME="451"></A><BR>Naught hath availed thee!  I have plucked thee away
<A NAME="452"></A><BR>From life, to which thou wast so fain to cling.
<A NAME="453"></A><BR>Rash fool, who didst defy a mightier man
<A NAME="454"></A><BR>Unknowing!  Beauty is no match for strength!"
<A NAME="455"></A><BR><BR>He spake, and leapt upon the slain to strip
<A NAME="456"></A><BR>His goodly arms: but now against him came
<A NAME="457"></A><BR>Machaon wroth for Nireus, by his side
<A NAME="458"></A><BR>Doom-overtaken.  With his spear he drave
<A NAME="459"></A><BR>At his right shoulder: strong albeit he was,
<A NAME="460"></A><BR>He touched him, and blood spurted from the gash.
<A NAME="461"></A><BR>Yet, ere he might leap back from grapple of death,
<A NAME="462"></A><BR>Even as a lion or fierce mountain-boar
<A NAME="463"></A><BR>Maddens mid thronging huntsmen, furious-fain
<A NAME="464"></A><BR>To rend the man whose hand first wounded him;
<A NAME="465"></A><BR>So fierce Eurypylus on Machaon rushed.
<A NAME="466"></A><BR>The long lance shot out swiftly, and pierced him 
<A NAME="467"></A>through
<A NAME="468"></A><BR>On the right haunch; yet would he not give back,
<A NAME="469"></A><BR>Nor flinch from the onset, fast though flowed the 
<A NAME="470"></A>blood.
<A NAME="471"></A><BR>In haste he snatched a huge stone from the ground,
<A NAME="472"></A><BR>And dashed it on the head of Telephus' son;
<A NAME="473"></A><BR>But his helm warded him from death or harm
<A NAME="474"></A><BR>Then waxed Eurypylus more hotly wroth
<A NAME="475"></A><BR>With that strong warrior, and in fury of soul
<A NAME="476"></A><BR>Clear through Machaon's breast he drave his spear,
<A NAME="477"></A><BR>And through the midriff passed the gory point.
<A NAME="478"></A><BR>He fell, as falls beneath a lion's jaws
<A NAME="479"></A><BR>A bull, and round him clashed his glancing arms.
<A NAME="480"></A><BR>Swiftly Eurypylus plucked the lance of death
<A NAME="481"></A><BR>Out of the wound, and vaunting cried aloud:
<A NAME="482"></A><BR>"Wretch, wisdom was not bound up in thine heart,
<A NAME="483"></A><BR>That thou, a weakling, didst come forth to fight
<A NAME="484"></A><BR>A mightier.  Therefore art thou in the toils
<A NAME="485"></A><BR>Of Doom.  Much profit shall be thine, when kites
<A NAME="486"></A><BR>Devour the flesh of thee in battle slain!
<A NAME="487"></A><BR>Ha, dost thou hope still to return, to 'scape
<A NAME="488"></A><BR>Mine hands?  A leech art thou, and soothing salves
<A NAME="489"></A><BR>Thou knowest, and by these didst haply hope
<A NAME="490"></A><BR>To flee the evil day!  Not thine own sire,
<A NAME="491"></A><BR>On the wind's wings descending from Olympus,
<A NAME="492"></A><BR>Should save thy life, not though between thy lips
<A NAME="493"></A><BR>He should pour nectar and ambrosia!"
<A NAME="494"></A><BR><BR>Faint-breathing answered him the dying man:
<A NAME="495"></A><BR>"Eurypylus, thine own weird is to live
<A NAME="496"></A><BR>Not long: Fate is at point to meet thee here
<A NAME="497"></A><BR>On Troy's plain, and to still thine impious tongue."
<A NAME="498"></A><BR><BR>So passed his spirit into Hades' halls.
<A NAME="499"></A><BR>Then to the dead man spake his conqueror:
<A NAME="500"></A><BR>"Now on the earth lie thou.  What shall betide
<A NAME="501"></A><BR>Hereafter, care I not -- yea, though this day
<A NAME="502"></A><BR>Death's doom stand by my feet: no man may live
<A NAME="503"></A><BR>For ever: each man's fate is foreordained."
<A NAME="504"></A><BR><BR>Stabbing the corpse he spake.  Then shouted 
<A NAME="505"></A>loud
<A NAME="506"></A><BR>Teucer, at seeing Machaon in the dust.
<A NAME="507"></A><BR>Far thence he stood hard-toiling in the fight,
<A NAME="508"></A><BR>For on the centre sore the battle lay:
<A NAME="509"></A><BR>Foe after foe pressed on; yet not for this
<A NAME="510"></A><BR>Was Teucer heedless of the fallen brave,
<A NAME="511"></A><BR>Neither of Nireus lying hard thereby
<A NAME="512"></A><BR>Behind Machaon in the dust.  He saw,
<A NAME="513"></A><BR><BR>And with a great voice raised the rescue-cry:
<A NAME="514"></A><BR>"Charge, Argives!  Flinch not from the charging 
<A NAME="515"></A>foe!
<A NAME="516"></A><BR>For shame unspeakable shall cover us
<A NAME="517"></A><BR>If Trojan men hale back to Ilium
<A NAME="518"></A><BR>Noble Machaon and Nireus godlike-fair.
<A NAME="519"></A><BR>Come, with a good heart let us face the foe
<A NAME="520"></A><BR>To rescue these slain friends, or fall ourselves
<A NAME="521"></A><BR>Beside them.  Duty bids that men defend
<A NAME="522"></A><BR>Friends, and to aliens leave them not a prey,
<A NAME="523"></A><BR>Not without sweat of toil is glory won!"
<A NAME="524"></A><BR><BR>Then were the Danaans anguish-stung: the earth
<A NAME="525"></A><BR>All round them dyed they red with blood of slain,
<A NAME="526"></A><BR>As foe fought foe in even-balanced fight.
<A NAME="527"></A><BR>By this to Podaleirius tidings came
<A NAME="528"></A><BR>How that in dust his brother lay, struck down
<A NAME="529"></A><BR>By woeful death.  Beside the ships he sat
<A NAME="530"></A><BR>Ministering to the hurts of men with spears
<A NAME="531"></A><BR>Stricken.  In wrath for his brother's sake he rose,
<A NAME="532"></A><BR>He clad him in his armour; in his breast
<A NAME="533"></A><BR>Dread battle-prowess swelled.  For conflict grim
<A NAME="534"></A><BR>He panted: boiled the mad blood round his heart
<A NAME="535"></A><BR>He leapt amidst the foemen; his swift hands
<A NAME="536"></A><BR>Swung the snake-headed javelin up, and hurled,
<A NAME="537"></A><BR>And slew with its winged speed Agamestor's son
<A NAME="538"></A><BR>Cleitus, a bright-haired Nymph had given him birth
<A NAME="539"></A><BR>Beside Parthenius, whose quiet stream
<A NAME="540"></A><BR>Fleets smooth as oil through green lands, till it 
<A NAME="541"></A>pours
<A NAME="542"></A><BR>Its shining ripples to the Euxine sea.
<A NAME="543"></A><BR>Then by his warrior-brother laid he low
<A NAME="544"></A><BR>Lassus, whom Pronoe, fair as a goddess, bare
<A NAME="545"></A><BR>Beside Nymphaeus' stream, hard by a cave,
<A NAME="546"></A><BR>A wide and wondrous cave: sacred it is
<A NAME="547"></A><BR>Men say, unto the Nymphs, even all that haunt
<A NAME="548"></A><BR>The long-ridged Paphlagonian hills, and all
<A NAME="549"></A><BR>That by full-clustered Heracleia dwell.
<A NAME="550"></A><BR>That cave is like the work of gods, of stone
<A NAME="551"></A><BR>In manner marvellous moulded: through it flows
<A NAME="552"></A><BR>Cold water crystal-clear: in niches round
<A NAME="553"></A><BR>Stand bowls of stone upon the rugged rock,
<A NAME="554"></A><BR>Seeming as they were wrought by carvers' hands.
<A NAME="555"></A><BR>Statues of Wood-gods stand around, fair Nymphs,
<A NAME="556"></A><BR>Looms, distaffs, all such things as mortal craft
<A NAME="557"></A><BR>Fashioneth.  Wondrous seem they unto men
<A NAME="558"></A><BR>Which pass into that hallowed cave.  It hath,
<A NAME="559"></A><BR>Up-leading and down-leading, doorways twain,
<A NAME="560"></A><BR>Facing, the one, the wild North's shrilling blasts,
<A NAME="561"></A><BR>And one the dank rain-burdened South.  By this
<A NAME="562"></A><BR>Do mortals pass beneath the Nymphs' wide cave;
<A NAME="563"></A><BR>But that is the Immortals' path: no man
<A NAME="564"></A><BR>May tread it, for a chasm deep and wide
<A NAME="565"></A><BR>Down-reaching unto Hades, yawns between.
<A NAME="566"></A><BR>This track the Blest Gods may alone behold.
<A NAME="567"></A><BR>So died a host on either side that warred
<A NAME="568"></A><BR>Over Machaon and Aglaia's son.
<A NAME="569"></A><BR>But at the last through desperate wrestle of fight
<A NAME="570"></A><BR>The Danaans rescued them: yet few were they
<A NAME="571"></A><BR>Which bare them to the ships: by bitter stress
<A NAME="572"></A><BR>Of conflict were the more part compassed round,
<A NAME="573"></A><BR>And needs must still abide the battle's brunt.
<A NAME="574"></A><BR>But when full many had filled the measure up
<A NAME="575"></A><BR>Of fate, mid tumult, blood and agony,
<A NAME="576"></A><BR>Then to their ships did many Argives flee
<A NAME="577"></A><BR>Pressed by Eurypylus hard, an avalanche
<A NAME="578"></A><BR>Of havoc.  Yet a few abode the strife
<A NAME="579"></A><BR>Round Aias and the Atreidae rallying;
<A NAME="580"></A><BR>And haply these had perished all, beset
<A NAME="581"></A><BR>By throngs on throngs of foes on every hand,
<A NAME="582"></A><BR>Had not Oileus' son stabbed with his spear
<A NAME="583"></A><BR>'Twixt shoulder and breast war-wise Polydamas;
<A NAME="584"></A><BR>Forth gushed the blood, and he recoiled a space.
<A NAME="585"></A><BR>Then Menelaus pierced Deiphobus
<A NAME="586"></A><BR>By the right breast, that with swift feet he fled.
<A NAME="587"></A><BR>And many of that slaughter-breathing throng
<A NAME="588"></A><BR>Were slain by Agamemnon: furiously
<A NAME="589"></A><BR>He rushed on godlike Aethicus with the spear;
<A NAME="590"></A><BR>But he shrank from the forefront back mid friends.
<A NAME="591"></A><BR><BR>Now when Eurypylus the battle-stay
<A NAME="592"></A><BR>Marked how the ranks of Troy gave back from fight,
<A NAME="593"></A><BR>He turned him from the host that he had chased
<A NAME="594"></A><BR>Even to the ships, and rushed with eagle-swoop
<A NAME="595"></A><BR>On Atreus' strong sons and Oileus' seed
<A NAME="596"></A><BR>Stout-hearted, who was passing fleet of foot
<A NAME="597"></A><BR>And in fight peerless.  Swiftly he charged on these
<A NAME="598"></A><BR>Grasping his spear long-shafted: at Iris side
<A NAME="599"></A><BR>Charged Paris, charged Aeneas stout of heart,
<A NAME="600"></A><BR>Who hurled a stone exceeding huge, that crashed
<A NAME="601"></A><BR>On Aias' helmet: dashed to the dust he was,
<A NAME="602"></A><BR>Yet gave not up the ghost, whose day of doom
<A NAME="603"></A><BR>Was fate-ordained amidst Caphaerus' rocks
<A NAME="604"></A><BR>On the home-voyage.  Now his valiant men
<A NAME="605"></A><BR>Out of the foes' hands snatched him, bare him thence,
<A NAME="606"></A><BR>Scarce drawing breath, to the Achaean ships.
<A NAME="607"></A><BR>And now the Atreid kings, the war-renowned,
<A NAME="608"></A><BR>Were left alone, and murder-breathing foes
<A NAME="609"></A><BR>Encompassed them, and hurled from every side
<A NAME="610"></A><BR>Whate'er their hands might find the deadly shaft
<A NAME="611"></A><BR>Some showered, some the stone, the javelin some.
<A NAME="612"></A><BR>They in the midst aye turned this way and that,
<A NAME="613"></A><BR>As boars or lions compassed round with pales
<A NAME="614"></A><BR>On that day when kings gather to the sport
<A NAME="615"></A><BR>The people, and have penned the mighty beasts
<A NAME="616"></A><BR>Within the toils of death; but these, although
<A NAME="617"></A><BR>With walls ringed round, yet tear with tusk and 
<A NAME="618"></A>fang
<A NAME="619"></A><BR>What luckless thrall soever draweth near.
<A NAME="620"></A><BR>So these death-compassed heroes slew their foes
<A NAME="621"></A><BR>Ever as they pressed on.  Yet had their might
<A NAME="622"></A><BR>Availed not for defence, for all their will,
<A NAME="623"></A><BR>Had Teucer and Idomeneus strong of heart
<A NAME="624"></A><BR>Come not to help, with Thoas, Meriones,
<A NAME="625"></A><BR>And godlike Thrasymedes, they which shrank
<A NAME="626"></A><BR>Erewhile before Eurypylus yea, had fled
<A NAME="627"></A><BR>Unto the ships to 'scape the crushing doom,
<A NAME="628"></A><BR>But that, in fear for Atreus' sons, they rallied
<A NAME="629"></A><BR>Against Eurypylus: deadly waxed the fight.
<A NAME="630"></A><BR><BR>Then Teucer with a mighty spear-thrust smote
<A NAME="631"></A><BR>Aeneas' shield, yet wounded not his flesh,
<A NAME="632"></A><BR>For the great fourfold buckler warded him;
<A NAME="633"></A><BR>Yet feared he, and recoiled a little space.
<A NAME="634"></A><BR>Leapt Meriones upon Laophoon
<A NAME="635"></A><BR>The son of Paeon, born by Axius' flood
<A NAME="636"></A><BR>Of bright-haired Cleomede.  Unto Troy
<A NAME="637"></A><BR>With noble Asteropaeus had he come
<A NAME="638"></A><BR>To aid her folk: him Meriones' keen spear
<A NAME="639"></A><BR>Stabbed 'neath the navel, and the lance-head tore
<A NAME="640"></A><BR>His bowels forth; swift sped his soul away
<A NAME="641"></A><BR>Into the Shadow-land.  Alcimedes,
<A NAME="642"></A><BR>The warrior-friend of Aias, Oileus' son,
<A NAME="643"></A><BR>Shot mid the press of Trojans; for he sped
<A NAME="644"></A><BR>With taunting shout a sharp stone from a sling
<A NAME="645"></A><BR>Into their battle's heart.  They quailed in fear
<A NAME="646"></A><BR>Before the hum and onrush of the bolt.
<A NAME="647"></A><BR>Fate winged its flight to the bold charioteer
<A NAME="648"></A><BR>Of Pammon, Hippasus' son: his brow it smote
<A NAME="649"></A><BR>While yet he grasped the reins, and flung him stunned
<A NAME="650"></A><BR>Down from the chariot-seat before the wheels.
<A NAME="651"></A><BR>The rushing war-wain whirled his wretched form
<A NAME="652"></A><BR>'Twixt tyres and heels of onward-leaping steeds,
<A NAME="653"></A><BR>And awful death in that hour swallowed him
<A NAME="654"></A><BR>When whip and reins had flown from his nerveless 
<A NAME="655"></A>hands.
<A NAME="656"></A><BR>Then grief thrilled Pammon: hard necessity
<A NAME="657"></A><BR>Made him both chariot-lord and charioteer.
<A NAME="658"></A><BR>Now to his doom and death-day had he bowed,
<A NAME="659"></A><BR>Had not a Trojan through that gory strife
<A NAME="660"></A><BR>Leapt, grasped the reins, and saved the prince, when 
<A NAME="661"></A>now
<A NAME="662"></A><BR>His strength failed 'neath the murderous hands of 
<A NAME="663"></A>foes.
<A NAME="664"></A><BR><BR>As godlike Acamas charged, the stalwart son
<A NAME="665"></A><BR>Of Nestor thrust the spear above his knee,
<A NAME="666"></A><BR>And with that wound sore anguish came on him:
<A NAME="667"></A><BR>Back from the fight he drew; the deadly strife
<A NAME="668"></A><BR>He left unto his comrades: quenched was now
<A NAME="669"></A><BR>His battle-lust.  Eurypylus' henchman smote
<A NAME="670"></A><BR>Echemmon, Thoas' friend, amidst the fray
<A NAME="671"></A><BR>Beneath the shoulder: nigh his heart the spear
<A NAME="672"></A><BR>Passed bitter-biting: o'er his limbs brake out
<A NAME="673"></A><BR>Mingled with blood cold sweat of agony.
<A NAME="674"></A><BR>He turned to flee; Eurypylus' giant might
<A NAME="675"></A><BR>Chased, caught him, shearing his heel-tendons through:
<A NAME="676"></A><BR>There, where the blow fell, his reluctant feet
<A NAME="677"></A><BR>Stayed, and the spirit left his mortal frame.
<A NAME="678"></A><BR>Thoas pricked Paris with quick-thrusting spear
<A NAME="679"></A><BR>On the right thigh: backward a space he ran
<A NAME="680"></A><BR>For his death-speeding bow, which had been left
<A NAME="681"></A><BR>To rearward of the fight.  Idomeneus
<A NAME="682"></A><BR>Upheaved a stone, huge as his hands could swing,
<A NAME="683"></A><BR>And dashed it on Eurypylus' arm: to earth
<A NAME="684"></A><BR>Fell his death-dealing spear.  Backward he stepped
<A NAME="685"></A><BR>To grasp another, since from out his hand
<A NAME="686"></A><BR>The first was smitten.  So had Atreus' sons
<A NAME="687"></A><BR>A moment's breathing-space from stress of war.
<A NAME="688"></A><BR>But swiftly drew Eurypylus' henchmen near
<A NAME="689"></A><BR>Bearing a stubborn-shafted lance, wherewith
<A NAME="690"></A><BR>He brake the strength of many.  In stormy might
<A NAME="691"></A><BR>Then charged he on the foe: whomso he met
<A NAME="692"></A><BR>He slew, and spread wide havoc through their ranks.
<A NAME="693"></A><BR><BR>Now neither Atreus' sons might steadfast stand,
<A NAME="694"></A><BR>Nor any valiant Danaan beside,
<A NAME="695"></A><BR>For ruinous panic suddenly gripped the hearts
<A NAME="696"></A><BR>Of all; for on them all Eurypylus rushed
<A NAME="697"></A><BR>Flashing death in their faces, chased them, slew,
<A NAME="698"></A><BR>Cried to the Trojans and to his chariot-lords:
<A NAME="699"></A><BR>"Friends, be of good heart!  To these Danaans
<A NAME="700"></A><BR>Let us deal slaughter and doom's darkness now!
<A NAME="701"></A><BR>Lo, how like scared sheep back to the ships they 
<A NAME="702"></A>flee!
<A NAME="703"></A><BR>Forget not your death-dealing battle-lore,
<A NAME="704"></A><BR>O ye that from your youth are men of war!"
<A NAME="705"></A><BR><BR>Then charged they on the Argives as one man;
<A NAME="706"></A><BR>And these in utter panic turned and fled
<A NAME="707"></A><BR>The bitter battle, those hard after them
<A NAME="708"></A><BR>Followed, as white-fanged hounds hold deer in chase
<A NAME="709"></A><BR>Up the long forest-glens.  Full many in dust
<A NAME="710"></A><BR>They dashed down, howsoe'er they longed to escape.
<A NAME="711"></A><BR>The slaughter grim and great of that wild fray.
<A NAME="712"></A><BR>Eurypylus hath slain Bucolion,
<A NAME="713"></A><BR>Nesus, and Chromion and Antiphus;
<A NAME="714"></A><BR>Twain in Mycenae dwelt, a goodly land;
<A NAME="715"></A><BR>In Lacedaemon twain.  Men of renown
<A NAME="716"></A><BR>Albeit they were, he slew them.  Then he smote
<A NAME="717"></A><BR>A host unnumbered of the common throng.
<A NAME="718"></A><BR>My strength should not suffice to sing their fate,
<A NAME="719"></A><BR>How fain soever, though within my breast
<A NAME="720"></A><BR>Were iron lungs.  Aeneas slew withal
<A NAME="721"></A><BR>Antimachus and Pheres, twain which left
<A NAME="722"></A><BR>Crete with Idomeneus.  Agenor smote
<A NAME="723"></A><BR>Molus the princely, -- with king Sthenelus
<A NAME="724"></A><BR>He came from Argos, -- hurled from far behind
<A NAME="725"></A><BR>A dart new-whetted, as he fled from fight,
<A NAME="726"></A><BR>Piercing his right leg, and the eager shaft
<A NAME="727"></A><BR>Cut sheer through the broad sinew, shattering
<A NAME="728"></A><BR>The bones with anguished pain: and so his doom
<A NAME="729"></A><BR>Met him, to die a death of agony.
<A NAME="730"></A><BR>Then Paris' arrows laid proud Phorcys low,
<A NAME="731"></A><BR>And Mosynus, brethren both, from Salamis
<A NAME="732"></A><BR>Who came in Aias' ships, and nevermore
<A NAME="733"></A><BR>Saw the home-land.  Cleolaus smote he next,
<A NAME="734"></A><BR>Meges' stout henchman; for the arrow struck
<A NAME="735"></A><BR>His left breast: deadly night enwrapped him round,
<A NAME="736"></A><BR>And his soul fleeted forth: his fainting heart
<A NAME="737"></A><BR>Still in his breast fluttering convulsively
<A NAME="738"></A><BR>Made the winged arrow shiver.  Yet again
<A NAME="739"></A><BR>Did Paris shoot at bold Eetion.
<A NAME="740"></A><BR>Through his jaw leapt the sudden-flashing brass:
<A NAME="741"></A><BR>He groaned, and with his blood were mingled tears.
<A NAME="742"></A><BR>So ever man slew man, till all the space
<A NAME="743"></A><BR>Was heaped with Argives each on other cast.
<A NAME="744"></A><BR>Now had the Trojans burnt with fire the ships,
<A NAME="745"></A><BR>Had not night, trailing heavy-folded mist,
<A NAME="746"></A><BR>Uprisen.  So Eurypylus drew back,
<A NAME="747"></A><BR>And Troy's sons with him, from the ships aloof
<A NAME="748"></A><BR>A little space, by Simois' outfall; there
<A NAME="749"></A><BR>Camped they exultant.  But amidst the ships
<A NAME="750"></A><BR>Flung down upon the sands the Argives wailed
<A NAME="751"></A><BR>Heart-anguished for the slain, so many of whom
<A NAME="752"></A><BR>Dark fate had overtaken and laid in dust.
