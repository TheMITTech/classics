<A NAME="10"></A><B>How By the Shaft of a God Laid Low Was Hero Achilles</B>
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="11"></A>When shone the light of Dawn the splendour-throned,
<A NAME="12"></A><BR>Then to the ships the Pylian spearmen bore
<A NAME="13"></A><BR>Antilochus' corpse, sore sighing for their prince,
<A NAME="14"></A><BR>And by the Hellespont they buried him
<A NAME="15"></A><BR>With aching hearts.  Around him groaning stood
<A NAME="16"></A><BR>The battle-eager sons of Argives, all,
<A NAME="17"></A><BR>Of love for Nestor, shrouded o'er with grief.
<A NAME="18"></A><BR>But that grey hero's heart was nowise crushed
<A NAME="19"></A><BR>By sorrow; for the wise man's soul endures
<A NAME="20"></A><BR>Bravely, and cowers not under affliction's stroke.
<A NAME="21"></A><BR>But Peleus' son, wroth for Antilochus
<A NAME="22"></A><BR>His dear friend, armed for vengeance terrible
<A NAME="23"></A><BR>Upon the Trojans.  Yea, and these withal,
<A NAME="24"></A><BR>Despite their dread of mighty Achilles' spear,
<A NAME="25"></A><BR>Poured battle-eager forth their gates, for now
<A NAME="26"></A><BR>The Fates with courage filled their breasts, of 
<A NAME="27"></A>whom
<A NAME="28"></A><BR>Many were doomed to Hades to descend,
<A NAME="29"></A><BR>Whence there is no return, thrust down by hands
<A NAME="30"></A><BR>Of Aeacus' son, who also was foredoomed
<A NAME="31"></A><BR>To perish that same day by Priam's wall.
<A NAME="32"></A><BR>Swift met the fronts of conflict: all the tribes
<A NAME="33"></A><BR>Of Troy's host, and the battle-biding Greeks,
<A NAME="34"></A><BR>Afire with that new-kindled fury of war.
<A NAME="35"></A><BR><BR>Then through the foe the son of Peleus made
<A NAME="36"></A><BR>Wide havoc: all around the earth was drenched
<A NAME="37"></A><BR>With gore, and choked with corpses were the streams
<A NAME="38"></A><BR>Of Simois and Xanthus.  Still he chased,
<A NAME="39"></A><BR>Still slaughtered, even to the city's walls;
<A NAME="40"></A><BR>For panic fell on all the host.  And now
<A NAME="41"></A><BR>All had he slain, had dashed the gates to earth,
<A NAME="42"></A><BR>Rending them from their hinges, or the bolts,
<A NAME="43"></A><BR>Hurling himself against them, had he snapped,
<A NAME="44"></A><BR>And for the Danaans into Priam's burg
<A NAME="45"></A><BR>Had made a way, had utterly destroyed
<A NAME="46"></A><BR>That goodly town -- but now was Phoebus wroth
<A NAME="47"></A><BR>Against him with grim fury, when he saw
<A NAME="48"></A><BR>Those countless troops of heroes slain of him.
<A NAME="49"></A><BR>Down from Olympus with a lion-leap
<A NAME="50"></A><BR>He came: his quiver on his shoulders lay,
<A NAME="51"></A><BR>And shafts that deal the wounds incurable.
<A NAME="52"></A><BR>Facing Achilles stood he; round him clashed
<A NAME="53"></A><BR>Quiver and arrows; blazed with quenchless flame
<A NAME="54"></A><BR>His eyes, and shook the earth beneath his feet.
<A NAME="55"></A><BR>Then with a terrible shout the great God cried,
<A NAME="56"></A><BR>So to turn back from war Achilles awed
<A NAME="57"></A><BR>By the voice divine, and save from death the Trojans:
<A NAME="58"></A><BR>"Back from the Trojans, Peleus' son!  Beseems not
<A NAME="59"></A><BR>That longer thou deal death unto thy foes,
<A NAME="60"></A><BR>Lest an Olympian God abase thy pride."
<A NAME="61"></A><BR><BR>But nothing quailed the hero at the voice
<A NAME="62"></A><BR>Immortal, for that round him even now
<A NAME="63"></A><BR>Hovered the unrelenting Fates.  He recked
<A NAME="64"></A><BR>Naught of the God, and shouted his defiance.
<A NAME="65"></A><BR>"Phoebus, why dost thou in mine own despite
<A NAME="66"></A><BR>Stir me to fight with Gods, and wouldst protect
<A NAME="67"></A><BR>The arrogant Trojans?  Heretofore hast thou
<A NAME="68"></A><BR>By thy beguiling turned me from the fray,
<A NAME="69"></A><BR>When from destruction thou at the first didst save
<A NAME="70"></A><BR>Hector, whereat the Trojans all through Troy
<A NAME="71"></A><BR>Exulted.  Nay, thou get thee back: return
<A NAME="72"></A><BR>Unto the mansion of the Blessed, lest
<A NAME="73"></A><BR>I smite thee -- ay, immortal though thou be!"
<A NAME="74"></A><BR><BR>Then on the God he turned his back, and sped
<A NAME="75"></A><BR>After the Trojans fleeing cityward,
<A NAME="76"></A><BR>And harried still their flight; but wroth at heart
<A NAME="77"></A><BR>Thus Phoebus spake to his indignant soul:
<A NAME="78"></A><BR>"Out on this man!  he is sense-bereft!  But now
<A NAME="79"></A><BR>Not Zeus himself nor any other Power
<A NAME="80"></A><BR>Shall save this madman who defies the Gods!"
<A NAME="81"></A><BR><BR>From mortal sight he vanished into cloud,
<A NAME="82"></A><BR>And cloaked with mist a baleful shaft he shot
<A NAME="83"></A><BR>Which leapt to Achilles' ankle: sudden pangs
<A NAME="84"></A><BR>With mortal sickness made his whole heart faint.
<A NAME="85"></A><BR>He reeled, and like a tower he fell, that falls
<A NAME="86"></A><BR>Smit by a whirlwind when an earthquake cleaves
<A NAME="87"></A><BR>A chasm for rushing blasts from underground;
<A NAME="88"></A><BR>So fell the goodly form of Aeacus' son.
<A NAME="89"></A><BR>He glared, a murderous glance, to right, to left,
<A NAME="90"></A><BR>[Upon the Trojans, and a terrible threat]
<A NAME="91"></A><BR>Shouted, a threat that could not be fulfilled:
<A NAME="92"></A><BR>"Who shot at me a stealthy-smiting shaft?
<A NAME="93"></A><BR>Let him but dare to meet me face to face!
<A NAME="94"></A><BR>So shall his blood and all his bowels gush out
<A NAME="95"></A><BR>About my spear, and he be hellward sped!
<A NAME="96"></A><BR>I know that none can meet me man to man
<A NAME="97"></A><BR>And quell in fight -- of earth-born heroes none,
<A NAME="98"></A><BR>Though such an one should bear within his breast
<A NAME="99"></A><BR>A heart unquailing, and have thews of brass.
<A NAME="100"></A><BR>But dastards still in stealthy ambush lurk
<A NAME="101"></A><BR>For lives of heroes.  Let him face me then! --
<A NAME="102"></A><BR>Ay! though he be a God whose anger burns
<A NAME="103"></A><BR>Against the Danaans!  Yea, mine heart forebodes
<A NAME="104"></A><BR>That this my smiter was Apollo, cloaked
<A NAME="105"></A><BR>In deadly darkness.  So in days gone by
<A NAME="106"></A><BR>My mother told me how that by his shafts
<A NAME="107"></A><BR>I was to die before the Scaean Gates
<A NAME="108"></A><BR>A piteous death.  Her words were not vain words."
<A NAME="109"></A><BR><BR>Then with unflinching hands from out the wound
<A NAME="110"></A><BR>Incurable he drew the deadly shaft
<A NAME="111"></A><BR>In agonized pain.  Forth gushed the blood; his heart
<A NAME="112"></A><BR>Waxed faint beneath the shadow of coming doom.
<A NAME="113"></A><BR>Then in indignant wrath he hurled from him
<A NAME="114"></A><BR>The arrow: a sudden gust of wind swept by,
<A NAME="115"></A><BR>And caught it up, and, even as he trod
<A NAME="116"></A><BR>Zeus' threshold, to Apollo gave it back;
<A NAME="117"></A><BR>For it beseemed not that a shaft divine,
<A NAME="118"></A><BR>Sped forth by an Immortal, should be lost.
<A NAME="119"></A><BR>He unto high Olympus swiftly came,
<A NAME="120"></A><BR>To the great gathering of immortal Gods,
<A NAME="121"></A><BR>Where all assembled watched the war of men,
<A NAME="122"></A><BR>These longing for the Trojans' triumph, those
<A NAME="123"></A><BR>For Danaan victory; so with diverse wills
<A NAME="124"></A><BR>Watched they the strife, the slayers and the slain.
<A NAME="125"></A><BR><BR>Him did the Bride of Zeus behold, and straight
<A NAME="126"></A><BR>Upbraided with exceeding bitter words:
<A NAME="127"></A><BR>"What deed of outrage, Phoebus, hast thou done
<A NAME="128"></A><BR>This day, forgetful of that day whereon
<A NAME="129"></A><BR>To godlike Peleus' spousals gathered all
<A NAME="130"></A><BR>The Immortals?  Yea, amidst the feasters thou
<A NAME="131"></A><BR>Sangest how Thetis silver-footed left
<A NAME="132"></A><BR>The sea's abysses to be Peleus' bride;
<A NAME="133"></A><BR>And as thou harpedst all earth's children came
<A NAME="134"></A><BR>To hearken, beasts and birds, high craggy hills,
<A NAME="135"></A><BR>Rivers, and all deep-shadowed forests came.
<A NAME="136"></A><BR>All this hast thou forgotten, and hast wrought
<A NAME="137"></A><BR>A ruthless deed, hast slain a godlike man,
<A NAME="138"></A><BR>Albeit thou with other Gods didst pour
<A NAME="139"></A><BR>The nectar, praying that he might be the son
<A NAME="140"></A><BR>By Thetis given to Peleus.  But that prayer
<A NAME="141"></A><BR>Hast thou forgotten, favouring the folk
<A NAME="142"></A><BR>Of tyrannous Laomedon, whose kine
<A NAME="143"></A><BR>Thou keptest.  He, a mortal, did despite
<A NAME="144"></A><BR>To thee, the deathless!  O, thou art wit-bereft!
<A NAME="145"></A><BR>Thou favourest Troy, thy sufferings all forgot.
<A NAME="146"></A><BR>Thou wretch, and doth thy false heart know not this,
<A NAME="147"></A><BR>What man is an offence, and meriteth
<A NAME="148"></A><BR>Suffering, and who is honoured of the Gods?
<A NAME="149"></A><BR>Ever Achilles showed us reverence -- yea,
<A NAME="150"></A><BR>Was of our race.  Ha, but the punishment
<A NAME="151"></A><BR>Of Troy, I ween, shall not be lighter, though
<A NAME="152"></A><BR>Aeacus' son have fallen; for his son
<A NAME="153"></A><BR>Right soon shall come from Scyros to the war
<A NAME="154"></A><BR>To help the Argive men, no less in might
<A NAME="155"></A><BR>Than was his sire, a bane to many a foe.
<A NAME="156"></A><BR>But thou -- thou for the Trojans dost not care,
<A NAME="157"></A><BR>But for his valour enviedst Peleus' son,
<A NAME="158"></A><BR>Seeing he was the mightest of all men.
<A NAME="159"></A><BR>Thou fool!  how wilt thou meet the Nereid's eyes,
<A NAME="160"></A><BR>When she shall stand in Zeus' hall midst the Gods,
<A NAME="161"></A><BR>Who praised thee once, and loved as her own son?"
<A NAME="162"></A><BR><BR>So Hera spake, in bitterness of soul
<A NAME="163"></A><BR>Upbraiding, but he answered her not a word,
<A NAME="164"></A><BR>Of reverence for his mighty Father's bride;
<A NAME="165"></A><BR>Nor could he lift his eyes to meet her eyes,
<A NAME="166"></A><BR>But sat abashed, aloof from all the Gods
<A NAME="167"></A><BR>Eternal, while in unforgiving wrath
<A NAME="168"></A><BR>Scowled on him all the Immortals who maintained
<A NAME="169"></A><BR>The Danaans' cause; but such as fain would bring
<A NAME="170"></A><BR>Triumph to Troy, these with exultant hearts
<A NAME="171"></A><BR>Extolled him, hiding it from Hera's eyes,
<A NAME="172"></A><BR>Before whose wrath all Heaven-abiders shrank.
<A NAME="173"></A><BR><BR>But Peleus' son the while forgat not yet
<A NAME="174"></A><BR>War's fury: still in his invincible limbs
<A NAME="175"></A><BR>The hot blood throbbed, and still he longed for 
<A NAME="176"></A>fight.
<A NAME="177"></A><BR>Was none of all the Trojans dared draw nigh
<A NAME="178"></A><BR>The stricken hero, but at distance stood,
<A NAME="179"></A><BR>As round a wounded lion hunters stand
<A NAME="180"></A><BR>Mid forest-brakes afraid, and, though the shaft
<A NAME="181"></A><BR>Stands in his heart, yet faileth not in him
<A NAME="182"></A><BR>His royal courage, but with terrible glare
<A NAME="183"></A><BR>Roll his fierce eyes, and roar his grimly jaws;
<A NAME="184"></A><BR>So wrath and anguish of his deadly hurt
<A NAME="185"></A><BR>To fury stung Peleides' soul; but aye
<A NAME="186"></A><BR>His strength ebbed through the god-envenomed wound.
<A NAME="187"></A><BR>Yet leapt he up, and rushed upon the foe,
<A NAME="188"></A><BR>And flashed the lightning of his lance; it slew
<A NAME="189"></A><BR>The goodly Orythaon, comrade stout
<A NAME="190"></A><BR>Of Hector, through his temples crashing clear:
<A NAME="191"></A><BR>His helm stayed not the long lance fury-sped
<A NAME="192"></A><BR>Which leapt therethrough, and won within the bones
<A NAME="193"></A><BR>The heart of the brain, and spilt his lusty life.
<A NAME="194"></A><BR>Then stabbed he 'neath the brow Hipponous
<A NAME="195"></A><BR>Even to the eye-roots, that the eyeball fell
<A NAME="196"></A><BR>To earth: his soul to Hades flitted forth.
<A NAME="197"></A><BR>Then through the jaw he pierced Alcathous,
<A NAME="198"></A><BR>And shore away his tongue: in dust he fell
<A NAME="199"></A><BR>Gasping his life out, and the spear-head shot
<A NAME="200"></A><BR>Out through his ear.  These, as they rushed on him,
<A NAME="201"></A><BR>That hero slew; but many a fleer's life
<A NAME="202"></A><BR>He spilt, for in his heart still leapt the blood.
<A NAME="203"></A><BR><BR>But when his limbs grew chill, and ebbed away
<A NAME="204"></A><BR>His spirit, leaning on his spear he stood,
<A NAME="205"></A><BR>While still the Trojans fled in huddled rout
<A NAME="206"></A><BR>Of panic, and he shouted unto them:
<A NAME="207"></A><BR>"Trojan and Dardan cravens, ye shall not
<A NAME="208"></A><BR>Even in my death, escape my merciless spear,
<A NAME="209"></A><BR>But unto mine Avenging Spirits ye
<A NAME="210"></A><BR>Shall pay -- ay, one and all -- destruction's debt!"
<A NAME="211"></A><BR><BR>He spake; they heard and quailed: as mid the 
<A NAME="212"></A>hills
<A NAME="213"></A><BR>Fawns tremble at a lion's deep-mouthed roar,
<A NAME="214"></A><BR>And terror-stricken flee the monster, so
<A NAME="215"></A><BR>The ranks of Trojan chariot-lords, the lines
<A NAME="216"></A><BR>Of battle-helpers drawn from alien lands,
<A NAME="217"></A><BR>Quailed at the last shout of Achilles, deemed
<A NAME="218"></A><BR>That he was woundless yet.  But 'neath the weight
<A NAME="219"></A><BR>Of doom his aweless heart, his mighty limbs,
<A NAME="220"></A><BR>At last were overborne.  Down midst the dead
<A NAME="221"></A><BR>He fell, as fails a beetling mountain-cliff.
<A NAME="222"></A><BR>Earth rang beneath him: clanged with a thundercrash
<A NAME="223"></A><BR>His arms, as Peleus' son the princely fell.
<A NAME="224"></A><BR>And still his foes with most exceeding dread
<A NAME="225"></A><BR>Stared at him, even as, when some murderous beast
<A NAME="226"></A><BR>Lies slain by shepherds, tremble still the sheep
<A NAME="227"></A><BR>Eyeing him, as beside the fold he lies,
<A NAME="228"></A><BR>And shrinking, as they pass him, far aloof
<A NAME="229"></A><BR>And, even as he were living, fear him dead;
<A NAME="230"></A><BR>So feared they him, Achilles now no more.
<A NAME="231"></A><BR><BR>Yet Paris strove to kindle those faint hearts;
<A NAME="232"></A><BR>For his own heart exulted, and he hoped,
<A NAME="233"></A><BR>Now Peleus' son, the Danaans' strength, had fallen,
<A NAME="234"></A><BR>Wholly to quench the Argive battle-fire:
<A NAME="235"></A><BR>"Friends, if ye help me truly and loyally,
<A NAME="236"></A><BR>Let us this day die, slain by Argive men,
<A NAME="237"></A><BR>Or live, and hale to Troy with Hector's steeds
<A NAME="238"></A><BR>In triumph Peleus' son thus fallen dead,
<A NAME="239"></A><BR>The steeds that, grieving, yearning for their lord
<A NAME="240"></A><BR>To fight have borne me since my brother died.
<A NAME="241"></A><BR>Might we with these but hale Achilles slain,
<A NAME="242"></A><BR>Glory were this for Hector's horses, yea,
<A NAME="243"></A><BR>For Hector -- if in Hades men have sense
<A NAME="244"></A><BR>Of righteous retribution.  This man aye
<A NAME="245"></A><BR>Devised but mischief for the sons of Troy;
<A NAME="246"></A><BR>And now Troy's daughters with exultant hearts
<A NAME="247"></A><BR>From all the city streets shall gather round,
<A NAME="248"></A><BR>As pantheresses wroth for stolen cubs,
<A NAME="249"></A><BR>Or lionesses, might stand around a man
<A NAME="250"></A><BR>Whose craft in hunting vexed them while he lived.
<A NAME="251"></A><BR>So round Achilles -- a dead corpse at last! --
<A NAME="252"></A><BR>In hurrying throngs Troy's daughters then shall 
<A NAME="253"></A>come
<A NAME="254"></A><BR>In unforgiving, unforgetting hate,
<A NAME="255"></A><BR>For parents wroth, for husbands slain, for sons,
<A NAME="256"></A><BR>For noble kinsmen.  Most of all shall joy
<A NAME="257"></A><BR>My father, and the ancient men, whose feet
<A NAME="258"></A><BR>Unwillingly are chained within the walls
<A NAME="259"></A><BR>By eld, if we shall hale him through our gates,
<A NAME="260"></A><BR>And give our foe to fowls of the air for meat."
<A NAME="261"></A><BR><BR>Then they, which feared him theretofore, in 
<A NAME="262"></A>haste
<A NAME="263"></A><BR>Closed round the corpse of strong-heart Aeacus' 
<A NAME="264"></A>son,
<A NAME="265"></A><BR>Glaucus, Aeneas, battle-fain Agenor,
<A NAME="266"></A><BR>And other cunning men in deadly fight,
<A NAME="267"></A><BR>Eager to hale him thence to Ilium
<A NAME="268"></A><BR>The god-built burg.  But Aias failed him not.
<A NAME="269"></A><BR>Swiftly that godlike man bestrode the dead:
<A NAME="270"></A><BR>Back from the corpse his long lance thrust them 
<A NAME="271"></A>all.
<A NAME="272"></A><BR>Yet ceased they not from onslaught; thronging round,
<A NAME="273"></A><BR>Still with swift rushes fought they for the prize,
<A NAME="274"></A><BR>One following other, like to long-lipped bees
<A NAME="275"></A><BR>Which hover round their hive in swarms on swarms
<A NAME="276"></A><BR>To drive a man thence; but he, recking naught
<A NAME="277"></A><BR>Of all their fury, carveth out the combs
<A NAME="278"></A><BR>Of nectarous honey: harassed sore are they
<A NAME="279"></A><BR>By smoke-reek and the robber; spite of all
<A NAME="280"></A><BR>Ever they dart against him; naught cares he;
<A NAME="281"></A><BR>So naught of all their onsets Aias recked;
<A NAME="282"></A><BR>But first he stabbed Agelaus in the breast,
<A NAME="283"></A><BR>And slew that son of Maion: Thestor next:
<A NAME="284"></A><BR>Ocythous he smote, Agestratus,
<A NAME="285"></A><BR>Aganippus, Zorus, Nessus, Erymas
<A NAME="286"></A><BR>The war-renowned, who came from Lycia-land
<A NAME="287"></A><BR>With mighty-hearted Glaucus, from his home
<A NAME="288"></A><BR>In Melanippion on the mountain-ridge,
<A NAME="289"></A><BR>Athena's fane, which Massikyton fronts
<A NAME="290"></A><BR>Anigh Chelidonia's headland, dreaded sore
<A NAME="291"></A><BR>Of scared seafarers, when its lowering crags
<A NAME="292"></A><BR>Must needs be doubled.  For his death the blood
<A NAME="293"></A><BR>Of famed Hippolochus' son was horror-chilled;
<A NAME="294"></A><BR>For this was his dear friend.  With one swift thrust
<A NAME="295"></A><BR>He pierced the sevenfold hides of Aias' shield,
<A NAME="296"></A><BR>Yet touched his flesh not; stayed the spear-head 
<A NAME="297"></A>was
<A NAME="298"></A><BR>By those thick hides and by the corset-plate
<A NAME="299"></A><BR>Which lapped his battle-tireless limbs.  But still
<A NAME="300"></A><BR>From that stern conflict Glaucus drew not back,
<A NAME="301"></A><BR>Burning to vanquish Aias, Aeacus' son,
<A NAME="302"></A><BR>And in his folly vaunting threatened him:
<A NAME="303"></A><BR>"Aias, men name thee mightiest man of all
<A NAME="304"></A><BR>The Argives, hold thee in passing-high esteem
<A NAME="305"></A><BR>Even as Achilles: therefore thou, I wot,
<A NAME="306"></A><BR>By that dead warrior dead this day shalt lie!"
<A NAME="307"></A><BR><BR>So hurled he forth a vain word, knowing not
<A NAME="308"></A><BR>How far in might above him was the man
<A NAME="309"></A><BR>Whom his spear threatened.  Battle-bider Aias
<A NAME="310"></A><BR>Darkly and scornfully glaring on him, said
<A NAME="311"></A><BR>"Thou craven wretch, and knowest thou not this,
<A NAME="312"></A><BR>How much was Hector mightier than thou
<A NAME="313"></A><BR>In war-craft?  yet before my might, my spear,
<A NAME="314"></A><BR>He shrank.  Ay, with his valour was there blent
<A NAME="315"></A><BR>Discretion.  Thou thy thoughts are deathward set,
<A NAME="316"></A><BR>Who dar'st defy me to the battle, me,
<A NAME="317"></A><BR>A mightier far than thou!  Thou canst not say
<A NAME="318"></A><BR>That friendship of our fathers thee shall screen;
<A NAME="319"></A><BR>Nor me thy gifts shall wile to let thee pass
<A NAME="320"></A><BR>Scatheless from war, as once did Tydeus' son.
<A NAME="321"></A><BR>Though thou didst 'scape his fury, will not I
<A NAME="322"></A><BR>Suffer thee to return alive from war.
<A NAME="323"></A><BR>Ha, in thy many helpers dost thou trust
<A NAME="324"></A><BR>Who with thee, like so many worthless flies,
<A NAME="325"></A><BR>Flit round the noble Achilles' corpse?  To these
<A NAME="326"></A><BR>Death and black doom shall my swift onset deal."
<A NAME="327"></A><BR><BR>Then on the Trojans this way and that he turned,
<A NAME="328"></A><BR>As mid long forest-glens a lion turns
<A NAME="329"></A><BR>On hounds, and Trojans many and Lycians slew
<A NAME="330"></A><BR>That came for honour hungry, till he stood
<A NAME="331"></A><BR>Mid a wide ring of flinchers; like a shoal
<A NAME="332"></A><BR>Of darting fish when sails into their midst
<A NAME="333"></A><BR>Dolphin or shark, a huge sea-fosterling;
<A NAME="334"></A><BR>So shrank they from the might of Telamon's son,
<A NAME="335"></A><BR>As aye he charged amidst the rout.  But still
<A NAME="336"></A><BR>Swarmed fighters up, till round Achilles' corse
<A NAME="337"></A><BR>To right, to left, lay in the dust the slain
<A NAME="338"></A><BR>Countless, as boars around a lion at bay;
<A NAME="339"></A><BR>And evermore the strife waxed deadlier.
<A NAME="340"></A><BR>Then too Hippolochus' war-wise son was slain
<A NAME="341"></A><BR>By Aias of the heart of fire.  He fell
<A NAME="342"></A><BR>Backward upon Achilles, even as falls
<A NAME="343"></A><BR>A sapling on a sturdy mountain-oak;
<A NAME="344"></A><BR>So quelled by the spear on Peleus' son he fell.
<A NAME="345"></A><BR>But for his rescue Anchises' stalwart son
<A NAME="346"></A><BR>Strove hard, with all his comrades battle-fain,
<A NAME="347"></A><BR>And haled the corse forth, and to sorrowing friends
<A NAME="348"></A><BR>Gave it, to bear to Ilium's hallowed burg.
<A NAME="349"></A><BR>Himself to spoil Achilles still fought on,
<A NAME="350"></A><BR>Till warrior Aias pierced him with the spear
<A NAME="351"></A><BR>Through the right forearm.  Swiftly leapt he back
<A NAME="352"></A><BR>From murderous war, and hasted thence to Troy.
<A NAME="353"></A><BR>There for his healing cunning leeches wrought,
<A NAME="354"></A><BR>Who stanched the blood-rush, and laid on the gash
<A NAME="355"></A><BR>Balms, such as salve war-stricken warriors' pangs.
<A NAME="356"></A><BR><BR>But Aias still fought on: here, there he slew
<A NAME="357"></A><BR>With thrusts like lightning-flashes.  His great 
<A NAME="358"></A>heart
<A NAME="359"></A><BR>Ached sorely for his mighty cousin slain.
<A NAME="360"></A><BR>And now the warrior-king Laertes' son
<A NAME="361"></A><BR>Fought at his side: before him blenched the foe,
<A NAME="362"></A><BR>As he smote down Peisander's fleetfoot son,
<A NAME="363"></A><BR>The warrior Maenalus, who left his home
<A NAME="364"></A><BR>In far-renowned Abydos: down on him
<A NAME="365"></A><BR>He hurled Atymnius, the goodly son
<A NAME="366"></A><BR>Whom Pegasis the bright-haired Nymph had borne
<A NAME="367"></A><BR>To strong Emathion by Granicus' stream.
<A NAME="368"></A><BR>Dead by his side he laid Orestius' son,
<A NAME="369"></A><BR>Proteus, who dwelt 'neath lofty Ida's folds.
<A NAME="370"></A><BR>Ah, never did his mother welcome home
<A NAME="371"></A><BR>That son from war, Panaceia beauty-famed!
<A NAME="372"></A><BR>He fell by Odysseus' hands, who spilt the lives
<A NAME="373"></A><BR>Of many more whom his death-hungering spear
<A NAME="374"></A><BR>Reached in that fight around the mighty dead.
<A NAME="375"></A><BR>Yet Alcon, son of Megacles battle-swift,
<A NAME="376"></A><BR>Hard by Odysseus' right knee drave the spear
<A NAME="377"></A><BR>Home, and about the glittering greave the blood
<A NAME="378"></A><BR>Dark-crimsom welled.  He recked not of the wound,
<A NAME="379"></A><BR>But was unto his smiter sudden death;
<A NAME="380"></A><BR>For clear through his shield he stabbed him with his 
<A NAME="381"></A>spear
<A NAME="382"></A><BR>Amidst his battle-fury: to the earth
<A NAME="383"></A><BR>Backward he dashed him by his giant might
<A NAME="384"></A><BR>And strength of hand: clashed round him in the dust
<A NAME="385"></A><BR>His armour, and his corslet was distained
<A NAME="386"></A><BR>With crimson life-blood.  Forth from flesh and shield
<A NAME="387"></A><BR>The hero plucked the spear of death: the soul
<A NAME="388"></A><BR>Followed the lance-head from the body forth,
<A NAME="389"></A><BR>And life forsook its mortal mansion.  Then
<A NAME="390"></A><BR>Rushed on his comrades, in his wound's despite,
<A NAME="391"></A><BR>Odysseus, nor from that stern battle-toil
<A NAME="392"></A><BR>Refrained him.  And by this a mingled host
<A NAME="393"></A><BR>Of Danaans eager-hearted fought around
<A NAME="394"></A><BR>The mighty dead, and many and many a foe
<A NAME="395"></A><BR>Slew they with those smooth-shafted ashen spears.
<A NAME="396"></A><BR>Even as the winds strew down upon the ground
<A NAME="397"></A><BR>The flying leaves, when through the forest-glades
<A NAME="398"></A><BR>Sweep the wild gusts, as waneth autumn-tide,
<A NAME="399"></A><BR>And the old year is dying; so the spears
<A NAME="400"></A><BR>Of dauntless Danaans strewed the earth with slain,
<A NAME="401"></A><BR>For loyal to dead Achilles were they all,
<A NAME="402"></A><BR>And loyal to hero Aias to the death.
<A NAME="403"></A><BR>For like black Doom he blasted the ranks of Troy.
<A NAME="404"></A><BR>Then against Aias Paris strained his bow;
<A NAME="405"></A><BR>But he was ware thereof, and sped a stone
<A NAME="406"></A><BR>Swift to the archer's head: that bolt of death
<A NAME="407"></A><BR>Crashed through his crested helm, and darkness closed
<A NAME="408"></A><BR>Round him.  In dust down fell he: naught availed
<A NAME="409"></A><BR>His shafts their eager lord, this way and that
<A NAME="410"></A><BR>Scattered in dust: empty his quiver lay,
<A NAME="411"></A><BR>Flew from his hand the bow.  In haste his friends
<A NAME="412"></A><BR>Upcaught him from the earth, and Hector's steeds
<A NAME="413"></A><BR>Hurried him thence to Troy, scarce drawing breath,
<A NAME="414"></A><BR>And moaning in his pain.  Nor left his men
<A NAME="415"></A><BR>The weapons of their lord, but gathered up
<A NAME="416"></A><BR>All from the plain, and bare them to the prince;
<A NAME="417"></A><BR>While Aias after him sent a wrathful shout:
<A NAME="418"></A><BR>"Dog, thou hast 'scaped the heavy hand of death
<A NAME="419"></A><BR>To-day!  But swiftly thy last hour shall come
<A NAME="420"></A><BR>By some strong Argive's hands, or by mine own,
<A NAME="421"></A><BR>But now have I a nobler task in hand,
<A NAME="422"></A><BR>From murder's grip to rescue Achilles' corse."
<A NAME="423"></A><BR>Then turned he on the foe, hurling swift doom
<A NAME="424"></A><BR>On such as fought around Peleides yet.
<A NAME="425"></A><BR>'These saw how many yielded up the ghost
<A NAME="426"></A><BR>Neath his strong hands, and, with hearts failing 
<A NAME="427"></A>them
<A NAME="428"></A><BR>For fear, against him could they stand no more.
<A NAME="429"></A><BR>As rascal vultures were they, which the swoop
<A NAME="430"></A><BR>Of an eagle, king of birds, scares far away
<A NAME="431"></A><BR>From carcasses of sheep that wolves have torn;
<A NAME="432"></A><BR>So this way, that way scattered they before
<A NAME="433"></A><BR>The hurtling stones, the sword, the might of Aias.
<A NAME="434"></A><BR>In utter panic from the war they fled,
<A NAME="435"></A><BR>In huddled rout, like starlings from the swoop
<A NAME="436"></A><BR>Of a death-dealing hawk, when, fleeing bane,
<A NAME="437"></A><BR>One drives against another, as they dart
<A NAME="438"></A><BR>All terror-huddled in tumultuous flight.
<A NAME="439"></A><BR>So from the war to Priam's burg they fled
<A NAME="440"></A><BR>Wretchedly clad with terror as a cloak,
<A NAME="441"></A><BR>Quailing from mighty Aias' battle-shout,
<A NAME="442"></A><BR>As with hands dripping blood-gouts he pursued.
<A NAME="443"></A><BR>Yea, all, one after other, had he slain,
<A NAME="444"></A><BR>Had they not streamed through city-gates flung wide
<A NAME="445"></A><BR>Hard-panting, pierced to the very heart with fear.
<A NAME="446"></A><BR>Pent therewithin he left them, as a shepherd
<A NAME="447"></A><BR>Leaves folded sheep, and strode back o'er the plain;
<A NAME="448"></A><BR>Yet never touched he with his feet the ground,
<A NAME="449"></A><BR>But aye he trod on dead men, arms, and blood;
<A NAME="450"></A><BR>For countless corpses lay o'er that wide stretch
<A NAME="451"></A><BR>Even from broad-wayed Troy to Hellespont,
<A NAME="452"></A><BR>Bodies of strong men slain, the spoil of Doom.
<A NAME="453"></A><BR>As when the dense stalks of sun-ripened corn
<A NAME="454"></A><BR>Fall 'neath the reapers' hands, and the long swaths,
<A NAME="455"></A><BR>Heavy with full ears, overspread the field,
<A NAME="456"></A><BR>And joys the heart of him who oversees
<A NAME="457"></A><BR>The toil, lord of the harvest; even so,
<A NAME="458"></A><BR>By baleful havoc overmastered, lay
<A NAME="459"></A><BR>All round face-downward men remembering not
<A NAME="460"></A><BR>The death-denouncing war-shout.  But the sons
<A NAME="461"></A><BR>Of fair Achaea left their slaughtered foes
<A NAME="462"></A><BR>In dust and blood unstripped of arms awhile
<A NAME="463"></A><BR>Till they should lay upon the pyre the son
<A NAME="464"></A><BR>Of Peleus, who in battle-shock had been
<A NAME="465"></A><BR>Their banner of victory, charging in his might.
<A NAME="466"></A><BR>So the kings drew him from that stricken field
<A NAME="467"></A><BR>Straining beneath the weight of giant limbs,
<A NAME="468"></A><BR>And with all loving care they bore him on,
<A NAME="469"></A><BR>And laid him in his tent before the ships.
<A NAME="470"></A><BR>And round him gathered that great host, and wailed
<A NAME="471"></A><BR>Heart-anguished him who had been the Achaeans' strength,
<A NAME="472"></A><BR>And now, forgotten all the splendour of spears,
<A NAME="473"></A><BR>Lay mid the tents by moaning Hellespont,
<A NAME="474"></A><BR>In stature more than human, even as lay
<A NAME="475"></A><BR>Tityos, who sought to force Queen Leto, when
<A NAME="476"></A><BR>She fared to Pytho: swiftly in his wrath
<A NAME="477"></A><BR>Apollo shot, and laid him low, who seemed
<A NAME="478"></A><BR>Invincible: in a foul lake of gore
<A NAME="479"></A><BR>There lay he, covering many a rood of ground,
<A NAME="480"></A><BR>On the broad earth, his mother; and she moaned
<A NAME="481"></A><BR>Over her son, of blessed Gods abhorred;
<A NAME="482"></A><BR>But Lady Leto laughed.  So grand of mould
<A NAME="483"></A><BR>There in the foemen's land lay Aeacus' son,
<A NAME="484"></A><BR>For joy to Trojans, but for endless grief
<A NAME="485"></A><BR>To Achaean men lamenting.  Moaned the air
<A NAME="486"></A><BR>With sighing from the abysses of the sea;
<A NAME="487"></A><BR>And passing heavy grew the hearts of all,
<A NAME="488"></A><BR>Thinking: "Now shall we perish by the hands
<A NAME="489"></A><BR>Of Trojans!"  Then by those dark ships they thought
<A NAME="490"></A><BR>Of white-haired fathers left in halls afar,
<A NAME="491"></A><BR>Of wives new-wedded, who by couches cold
<A NAME="492"></A><BR>Mourned, waiting, waiting, with their tender babes
<A NAME="493"></A><BR>For husbands unreturning; and they groaned
<A NAME="494"></A><BR>In bitterness of soul.  A passion of grief
<A NAME="495"></A><BR>Came o'er their hearts; they fell upon their faces
<A NAME="496"></A><BR>On the deep sand flung down, and wept as men
<A NAME="497"></A><BR>All comfortless round Peleus' mighty son,
<A NAME="498"></A><BR>And clutched and plucked out by the roots their 
<A NAME="499"></A>hair,
<A NAME="500"></A><BR>And east upon their heads defiling sand.
<A NAME="501"></A><BR>Their cry was like the cry that goeth up
<A NAME="502"></A><BR>From folk that after battle by their walls
<A NAME="503"></A><BR>Are slaughtered, when their maddened foes set fire
<A NAME="504"></A><BR>To a great city, and slay in heaps on heaps
<A NAME="505"></A><BR>Her people, and make spoil of all her wealth;
<A NAME="506"></A><BR>So wild and high they wailed beside the sea,
<A NAME="507"></A><BR>Because the Danaans' champion, Aeacus' son,
<A NAME="508"></A><BR>Lay, grand in death, by a God's arrow slain,
<A NAME="509"></A><BR>As Ares lay, when She of the Mighty Father
<A NAME="510"></A><BR>With that huge stone down dashed him on Troy's plain.
<A NAME="511"></A><BR><BR>Ceaselessly wailed the Myrmidons Achilles,
<A NAME="512"></A><BR>A ring of mourners round the kingly dead,
<A NAME="513"></A><BR>That kind heart, friend alike to each and all,
<A NAME="514"></A><BR>To no man arrogant nor hard of mood,
<A NAME="515"></A><BR>But ever tempering strength with courtesy.
<A NAME="516"></A><BR><BR>Then Aias first, deep-groaning, uttered forth
<A NAME="517"></A><BR>His yearning o'er his father's brother's son
<A NAME="518"></A><BR>God-stricken -- ay, no man had smitten him
<A NAME="519"></A><BR>Of all upon the wide-wayed earth that dwell!
<A NAME="520"></A><BR>Him glorious Aias heavy-hearted mourned,
<A NAME="521"></A><BR>Now wandering to the tent of Peleus' son,
<A NAME="522"></A><BR>Now cast down all his length, a giant form,
<A NAME="523"></A><BR>On the sea-sands; and thus lamented he:
<A NAME="524"></A><BR>"Achilles, shield and sword of Argive men,
<A NAME="525"></A><BR>Thou hast died in Troy, from Phthia's plains afar,
<A NAME="526"></A><BR>Smitten unwares by that accursed shaft,
<A NAME="527"></A><BR>Such thing as weakling dastards aim in fight!
<A NAME="528"></A><BR>For none who trusts in wielding the great shield,
<A NAME="529"></A><BR>None who for war can skill to set the helm
<A NAME="530"></A><BR>Upon his brows, and sway the spear in grip,
<A NAME="531"></A><BR>And cleave the brass about the breasts of foes,
<A NAME="532"></A><BR>Warreth with arrows, shrinking from the fray.
<A NAME="533"></A><BR>Not man to man he met thee, whoso smote;
<A NAME="534"></A><BR>Else woundless never had he 'scaped thy lance!
<A NAME="535"></A><BR>But haply Zeus purposed to ruin all,
<A NAME="536"></A><BR>And maketh all our toil and travail vain --
<A NAME="537"></A><BR>Ay, now will grant the Trojans victory
<A NAME="538"></A><BR>Who from Achaea now hath reft her shield!
<A NAME="539"></A><BR>Ah me!  how shall old Peleus in his halls
<A NAME="540"></A><BR>Take up the burden of a mighty grief
<A NAME="541"></A><BR>Now in his joyless age!  His heart shall break
<A NAME="542"></A><BR>At the mere rumour of it.  Better so,
<A NAME="543"></A><BR>Thus in a moment to forget all pain.
<A NAME="544"></A><BR>But if these evil tidings slay him not,
<A NAME="545"></A><BR>Ah, laden with sore sorrow eld shall come
<A NAME="546"></A><BR>Upon him, eating out his heart with grief
<A NAME="547"></A><BR>By a lone hearth Peleus so passing dear
<A NAME="548"></A><BR>Once to the Blessed!  But the Gods vouchsafe
<A NAME="549"></A><BR>No perfect happiness to hapless men."
<A NAME="550"></A><BR><BR>So he in grief lamented Peleus' son.
<A NAME="551"></A><BR>Then ancient Phoenix made heart-stricken moan,
<A NAME="552"></A><BR>Clasping the noble form of Aeacus' seed,
<A NAME="553"></A><BR>And in wild anguish wailed the wise of heart:
<A NAME="554"></A><BR>"Thou art reft from me, dear child, and cureless 
<A NAME="555"></A>pain
<A NAME="556"></A><BR>Hast left to me!  Oh that upon my face
<A NAME="557"></A><BR>The veiling earth had fallen, ere I saw
<A NAME="558"></A><BR>Thy bitter doom!  No pang more terrible
<A NAME="559"></A><BR>Hath ever stabbed mine heart no, not that hour
<A NAME="560"></A><BR>Of exile, when I fled from fatherland
<A NAME="561"></A><BR>And noble parents, fleeing Hellas through,
<A NAME="562"></A><BR>Till Peleus welcomed me with gifts, and lord
<A NAME="563"></A><BR>Of his Dolopians made me.  In his arms
<A NAME="564"></A><BR>Thee through his halls one day he bare, and set
<A NAME="565"></A><BR>Upon my knees, and bade me foster thee,
<A NAME="566"></A><BR>His babe, with all love, as mine own dear child:
<A NAME="567"></A><BR>I hearkened to him: blithely didst thou cling
<A NAME="568"></A><BR>About mine heart, and, babbling wordless speech,
<A NAME="569"></A><BR>Didst call me `father' oft, and didst bedew
<A NAME="570"></A><BR>My breast and tunic with thy baby lips.
<A NAME="571"></A><BR>Ofttimes with soul that laughed for glee I held
<A NAME="572"></A><BR>Thee in mine arms; for mine heart whispered me
<A NAME="573"></A><BR>`This fosterling through life shall care for thee,
<A NAME="574"></A><BR>Staff of thine age shall be.'  And that mine hope
<A NAME="575"></A><BR>Was for a little while fulfilled; but now
<A NAME="576"></A><BR>Thou hast vanished into darkness, and to me
<A NAME="577"></A><BR>Is left long heart-ache wild with all regret.
<A NAME="578"></A><BR>Ah, might my sorrow slay me, ere the tale
<A NAME="579"></A><BR>To noble Peleus come!  When on his ears
<A NAME="580"></A><BR>Falleth the heavy tidings, he shall weep
<A NAME="581"></A><BR>And wail without surcease.  Most piteous grief
<A NAME="582"></A><BR>We twain for thy sake shall inherit aye,
<A NAME="583"></A><BR>Thy sire and I, who, ere our day of doom,
<A NAME="584"></A><BR>Mourning shall go down to the grave for thee --
<A NAME="585"></A><BR>Ay, better this than life unholpen of thee!"
<A NAME="586"></A><BR><BR>So moaned his ever-swelling tide of grief.
<A NAME="587"></A><BR>And Atreus' son beside him mourned and wept
<A NAME="588"></A><BR>With heart on fire with inly smouldering pain:
<A NAME="589"></A><BR>"Thou hast perished, chiefest of the Danaan men,
<A NAME="590"></A><BR>Hast perished, and hast left the Achaean host
<A NAME="591"></A><BR>Fenceless!  Now thou art fallen, are they left
<A NAME="592"></A><BR>An easier prey to foes.  Thou hast given joy
<A NAME="593"></A><BR>To Trojans by thy fall, who dreaded thee
<A NAME="594"></A><BR>As sheep a lion.  These with eager hearts
<A NAME="595"></A><BR>Even to the ships will bring the battle now.
<A NAME="596"></A><BR>Zeus, Father, thou too with deceitful words
<A NAME="597"></A><BR>Beguilest mortals!  Thou didst promise me
<A NAME="598"></A><BR>That Priam's burg should be destroyed; but now
<A NAME="599"></A><BR>That promise given dost thou not fulfil,
<A NAME="600"></A><BR>But thou didst cheat mine heart: I shall not win
<A NAME="601"></A><BR>The war's goal, now Achilles is no more."
<A NAME="602"></A><BR><BR>So did he cry heart-anguished.  Mourned all 
<A NAME="603"></A>round
<A NAME="604"></A><BR>Wails multitudinous for Peleus' son:
<A NAME="605"></A><BR>The dark ships echoed back the voice of grief,
<A NAME="606"></A><BR>And sighed and sobbed the immeasurable air.
<A NAME="607"></A><BR>And as when long sea-rollers, onward driven
<A NAME="608"></A><BR>By a great wind, heave up far out at sea,
<A NAME="609"></A><BR>And strandward sweep with terrible rush, and aye
<A NAME="610"></A><BR>Headland and beach with shattered spray are scourged,
<A NAME="611"></A><BR>And roar unceasing; so a dread sound rose
<A NAME="612"></A><BR>Of moaning of the Danaans round the corse,
<A NAME="613"></A><BR>Ceaselessly wailing Peleus' aweless son.
<A NAME="614"></A><BR><BR>And on their mourning soon black night had come,
<A NAME="615"></A><BR>But spake unto Atreides Neleus' son,
<A NAME="616"></A><BR>Nestor, whose own heart bare its load of grief
<A NAME="617"></A><BR>Remembering his own son Antilochus:
<A NAME="618"></A><BR>"O mighty Agamemnon, sceptre-lord
<A NAME="619"></A><BR>Of Argives, from wide-shrilling lamentation
<A NAME="620"></A><BR>Refrain we for this day.  None shall withhold
<A NAME="621"></A><BR>Hereafter these from all their heart's desire
<A NAME="622"></A><BR>Of weeping and lamenting many days.
<A NAME="623"></A><BR>But now go to, from aweless Aeacus' son
<A NAME="624"></A><BR>Wash we the foul blood-gouts, and lay we him
<A NAME="625"></A><BR>Upon a couch: unseemly it is to shame
<A NAME="626"></A><BR>The dead by leaving them untended long."
<A NAME="627"></A><BR><BR>So counselled Neleus' son, the passing-wise.
<A NAME="628"></A><BR>Then hasted he his men, and bade them set
<A NAME="629"></A><BR>Caldrons of cold spring-water o'er the flames,
<A NAME="630"></A><BR>And wash the corse, and clothe in vesture fair,
<A NAME="631"></A><BR>Sea-purple, which his mother gave her son
<A NAME="632"></A><BR>At his first sailing against Troy.  With speed
<A NAME="633"></A><BR>They did their lord's command: with loving care,
<A NAME="634"></A><BR>All service meetly rendered, on a couch
<A NAME="635"></A><BR>Laid they the mighty fallen, Peleus' son.
<A NAME="636"></A><BR><BR>The Trito-born, the passing-wise, beheld
<A NAME="637"></A><BR>And pitied him, and showered upon his head
<A NAME="638"></A><BR>Ambrosia, which hath virtue aye to keep
<A NAME="639"></A><BR>Taintless, men say, the flesh of warriors slain.
<A NAME="640"></A><BR>Like softly-breathing sleeper dewy-fresh
<A NAME="641"></A><BR>She made him: over that dead face she drew
<A NAME="642"></A><BR>A stern frown, even as when he lay, with wrath
<A NAME="643"></A><BR>Darkening his grim face, clasping his slain friend
<A NAME="644"></A><BR>Patroclus; and she made his frame to be
<A NAME="645"></A><BR>More massive, like a war-god to behold.
<A NAME="646"></A><BR>And wonder seized the Argives, as they thronged
<A NAME="647"></A><BR>And saw the image of a living man,
<A NAME="648"></A><BR>Where all the stately length of Peleus' son
<A NAME="649"></A><BR>Lay on the couch, and seemed as though he slept.
<A NAME="650"></A><BR><BR>Around him all the woeful captive-maids,
<A NAME="651"></A><BR>Whom he had taken for a prey, what time
<A NAME="652"></A><BR>He had ravaged hallowed Lemnos, and had scaled
<A NAME="653"></A><BR>The towered crags of Thebes, Eetion's town,
<A NAME="654"></A><BR>Wailed, as they stood and rent their fair young 
<A NAME="655"></A>flesh,
<A NAME="656"></A><BR>And smote their breasts, and from their hearts bemoaned
<A NAME="657"></A><BR>That lord of gentleness and courtesy,
<A NAME="658"></A><BR>Who honoured even the daughters of his foes.
<A NAME="659"></A><BR>And stricken most of all with heart-sick pain
<A NAME="660"></A><BR>Briseis, hero Achilles' couchmate, bowed
<A NAME="661"></A><BR>Over the dead, and tore her fair young flesh
<A NAME="662"></A><BR>With ruthless fingers, shrieking: her soft breast
<A NAME="663"></A><BR>Was ridged with gory weals, so cruelly
<A NAME="664"></A><BR>She smote it thou hadst said that crimson blood
<A NAME="665"></A><BR>Had dripped on milk.  Yet, in her griefs despite,
<A NAME="666"></A><BR>Her winsome loveliness shone out, and grace
<A NAME="667"></A><BR>Hung like a veil about her, as she wailed:
<A NAME="668"></A><BR>"Woe for this grief passing all griefs beside!
<A NAME="669"></A><BR>Never on me came anguish like to this
<A NAME="670"></A><BR>Not when my brethren died, my fatherland
<A NAME="671"></A><BR>Was wasted -- like this anguish for thy death!
<A NAME="672"></A><BR>Thou wast my day, my sunlight, my sweet life,
<A NAME="673"></A><BR>Mine hope of good, my strong defence from harm,
<A NAME="674"></A><BR>Dearer than all my beauty -- yea, more dear
<A NAME="675"></A><BR>Than my lost parents!  Thou wast all in all
<A NAME="676"></A><BR>To me, thou only, captive though I be.
<A NAME="677"></A><BR>Thou tookest from me every bondmaid's task
<A NAME="678"></A><BR>And like a wife didst hold me.  Ah, but now
<A NAME="679"></A><BR>Me shall some new Achaean master bear
<A NAME="680"></A><BR>To fertile Sparta, or to thirsty Argos.
<A NAME="681"></A><BR>The bitter cup of thraldom shall I drain,
<A NAME="682"></A><BR>Severed, ah me, from thee!  Oh that the earth
<A NAME="683"></A><BR>Had veiled my dead face ere I saw thy doom!"
<A NAME="684"></A><BR><BR>So for slain Peleus' son did she lament
<A NAME="685"></A><BR>With woeful handmaids and heart-anguished Greeks,
<A NAME="686"></A><BR>Mourning a king, a husband.  Never dried
<A NAME="687"></A><BR>Her tears were: ever to the earth they streamed
<A NAME="688"></A><BR>Like sunless water trickling from a rock
<A NAME="689"></A><BR>While rime and snow yet mantle o'er the earth
<A NAME="690"></A><BR>Above it; yet the frost melts down before
<A NAME="691"></A><BR>The east-wind and the flame-shafts of the sun.
<A NAME="692"></A><BR><BR>Now came the sound of that upringing wail
<A NAME="693"></A><BR>To Nereus' Daughters, dwellers in the depths
<A NAME="694"></A><BR>Unfathomed.  With sore anguish all their hearts
<A NAME="695"></A><BR>Were smitten: piteously they moaned: their cry
<A NAME="696"></A><BR>Shivered along the waves of Hellespont.
<A NAME="697"></A><BR>Then with dark mantles overpalled they sped
<A NAME="698"></A><BR>Swiftly to where the Argive men were thronged.
<A NAME="699"></A><BR>As rushed their troop up silver paths of sea,
<A NAME="700"></A><BR>The flood disported round them as they came.
<A NAME="701"></A><BR>With one wild cry they floated up; it rang,
<A NAME="702"></A><BR>A sound as when fleet-flying cranes forebode
<A NAME="703"></A><BR>A great storm.  Moaned the monsters of the deep
<A NAME="704"></A><BR>Plaintively round that train of mourners.  Fast
<A NAME="705"></A><BR>On sped they to their goal, with awesome cry
<A NAME="706"></A><BR>Wailing the while their sister's mighty son.
<A NAME="707"></A><BR>Swiftly from Helicon the Muses came
<A NAME="708"></A><BR>Heart-burdened with undying grief, for love
<A NAME="709"></A><BR>And honour to the Nereid starry-eyed.
<A NAME="710"></A><BR><BR>Then Zeus with courage filled the Argive men,
<A NAME="711"></A><BR>That-eyes of flesh might undismayed behold
<A NAME="712"></A><BR>That glorious gathering of Goddesses.
<A NAME="713"></A><BR>Then those Divine Ones round Achilles' corse
<A NAME="714"></A><BR>Pealed forth with one voice from immortal lips
<A NAME="715"></A><BR>A lamentation.  Rang again the shores
<A NAME="716"></A><BR>Of Hellespont.  As rain upon the earth
<A NAME="717"></A><BR>Their tears fell round the dead man, Aeacus' son;
<A NAME="718"></A><BR>For out of depths of sorrow rose their moan.
<A NAME="719"></A><BR>And all the armour, yea, the tents, the ships
<A NAME="720"></A><BR>Of that great sorrowing multitude were wet
<A NAME="721"></A><BR>With tears from ever-welling springs of grief.
<A NAME="722"></A><BR>His mother cast her on him, clasping him,
<A NAME="723"></A><BR>And kissed her son's lips, crying through her tears:
<A NAME="724"></A><BR>"Now let the rosy-vestured Dawn in heaven
<A NAME="725"></A><BR>Exult!  Now let broad-flowing Axius
<A NAME="726"></A><BR>Exult, and for Asteropaeus dead
<A NAME="727"></A><BR>Put by his wrath!  Let Priam's seed be glad
<A NAME="728"></A><BR>But I unto Olympus will ascend,
<A NAME="729"></A><BR>And at the feet of everlasting Zeus
<A NAME="730"></A><BR>Will cast me, bitterly planning that he gave
<A NAME="731"></A><BR>Me, an unwilling bride, unto a man --
<A NAME="732"></A><BR>A man whom joyless eld soon overtook,
<A NAME="733"></A><BR>To whom the Fates are near, with death for gift.
<A NAME="734"></A><BR>Yet not so much for his lot do I grieve
<A NAME="735"></A><BR>As for Achilles; for Zeus promised me
<A NAME="736"></A><BR>To make him glorious in the Aeacid halls,
<A NAME="737"></A><BR>In recompense for the bridal I so loathed
<A NAME="738"></A><BR>That into wild wind now I changed me, now
<A NAME="739"></A><BR>To water, now in fashion as a bird
<A NAME="740"></A><BR>I was, now as the blast of flame; nor might
<A NAME="741"></A><BR>A mortal win me for his bride, who seemed
<A NAME="742"></A><BR>All shapes in turn that earth and heaven contain,
<A NAME="743"></A><BR>Until the Olympian pledged him to bestow
<A NAME="744"></A><BR>A godlike son on me, a lord of war.
<A NAME="745"></A><BR>Yea, in a manner this did he fulfil
<A NAME="746"></A><BR>Faithfully; for my son was mightiest
<A NAME="747"></A><BR>Of men.  But Zeus made brief his span of life
<A NAME="748"></A><BR>Unto my sorrow.  Therefore up to heaven
<A NAME="749"></A><BR>Will I: to Zeus's mansion will I go
<A NAME="750"></A><BR>And wail my son, and will put Zeus in mind
<A NAME="751"></A><BR>Of all my travail for him and his sons
<A NAME="752"></A><BR>In their sore stress, and sting his soul with shame."
<A NAME="753"></A><BR><BR>So in her wild lament the Sea-queen cried.
<A NAME="754"></A><BR>But now to Thetis spake Calliope,
<A NAME="755"></A><BR>She in whose heart was steadfast wisdom throned:
<A NAME="756"></A><BR>"From lamentation, Thetis, now forbear,
<A NAME="757"></A><BR>And do not, in the frenzy of thy grief
<A NAME="758"></A><BR>For thy lost son, provoke to wrath the Lord
<A NAME="759"></A><BR>Of Gods and men.  Lo, even sons of Zeus,
<A NAME="760"></A><BR>The Thunder-king, have perished, overborne
<A NAME="761"></A><BR>By evil fate.  Immortal though I be,
<A NAME="762"></A><BR>Mine own son Orpheus died, whose magic song
<A NAME="763"></A><BR>Drew all the forest-trees to follow him,
<A NAME="764"></A><BR>And every craggy rock and river-stream,
<A NAME="765"></A><BR>And blasts of winds shrill-piping stormy-breathed,
<A NAME="766"></A><BR>And birds that dart through air on rushing wings.
<A NAME="767"></A><BR>Yet I endured mine heavy sorrow: Gods
<A NAME="768"></A><BR>Ought not with anguished grief to vex their souls.
<A NAME="769"></A><BR>Therefore make end of sorrow-stricken wail
<A NAME="770"></A><BR>For thy brave child; for to the sons of earth
<A NAME="771"></A><BR>Minstrels shall chant his glory and his might,
<A NAME="772"></A><BR>By mine and by my sisters' inspiration,
<A NAME="773"></A><BR>Unto the end of time.  Let not thy soul
<A NAME="774"></A><BR>Be crushed by dark grief, nor do thou lament
<A NAME="775"></A><BR>Like those frail mortal women.  Know'st thou not
<A NAME="776"></A><BR>That round all men which dwell upon the earth
<A NAME="777"></A><BR>Hovereth irresistible deadly Fate,
<A NAME="778"></A><BR>Who recks not even of the Gods?  Such power
<A NAME="779"></A><BR>She only hath for heritage.  Yea, she
<A NAME="780"></A><BR>Soon shall destroy gold-wealthy Priam's town,
<A NAME="781"></A><BR>And Trojans many and Argives doom to death,
<A NAME="782"></A><BR>Whomso she will.  No God can stay her hand."
<A NAME="783"></A><BR><BR>So in her wisdom spake Calliope.
<A NAME="784"></A><BR>Then plunged the sun down into Ocean's stream,
<A NAME="785"></A><BR>And sable-vestured Night came floating up
<A NAME="786"></A><BR>O'er the wide firmament, and brought her boon
<A NAME="787"></A><BR>Of sleep to sorrowing mortals.  On the sands
<A NAME="788"></A><BR>There slept they, all the Achaean host, with heads
<A NAME="789"></A><BR>Bowed 'neath the burden of calamity.
<A NAME="790"></A><BR>But upon Thetis sleep laid not his hand:
<A NAME="791"></A><BR>Still with the deathless Nereids by the sea
<A NAME="792"></A><BR>She sate; on either side the Muses spake
<A NAME="793"></A><BR>One after other comfortable words
<A NAME="794"></A><BR>To make that sorrowing heart forget its pain.
<A NAME="795"></A><BR><BR>But when with a triumphant laugh the Dawn
<A NAME="796"></A><BR>Soared up the sky, and her most radiant light
<A NAME="797"></A><BR>Shed over all the Trojans and their king,
<A NAME="798"></A><BR>Then, sorrowing sorely for Achilles still,
<A NAME="799"></A><BR>The Danaans woke to weep.  Day after day,
<A NAME="800"></A><BR>For many days they wept.  Around them moaned
<A NAME="801"></A><BR>Far-stretching beaches of the sea, and mourned
<A NAME="802"></A><BR>Great Nereus for his daughter Thetis' sake;
<A NAME="803"></A><BR>And mourned with him the other Sea-gods all
<A NAME="804"></A><BR>For dead Achilles.  Then the Argives gave
<A NAME="805"></A><BR>The corpse of great Peleides to the flame.
<A NAME="806"></A><BR>A pyre of countless tree-trunks built they up
<A NAME="807"></A><BR>Which, all with one mind toiling, from the heights
<A NAME="808"></A><BR>Of Ida they brought down; for Atreus' sons
<A NAME="809"></A><BR>Sped on the work, and charged them to bring thence
<A NAME="810"></A><BR>Wood without measure, that consumed with speed
<A NAME="811"></A><BR>Might be Achilles' body.  All around
<A NAME="812"></A><BR>Piled they about the pyre much battle-gear
<A NAME="813"></A><BR>Of strong men slain; and slew and cast thereon
<A NAME="814"></A><BR>Full many goodly sons of Trojan men,
<A NAME="815"></A><BR>And snorting steeds, and mighty bulls withal,
<A NAME="816"></A><BR>And sheep and fatling swine thereon they cast.
<A NAME="817"></A><BR>And wailing captive maids from coffers brought
<A NAME="818"></A><BR>Mantles untold; all cast they on the pyre:
<A NAME="819"></A><BR>Gold heaped they there and amber.  All their hair
<A NAME="820"></A><BR>The Myrmidons shore, and shrouded with the same
<A NAME="821"></A><BR>The body of their king.  Briseis laid
<A NAME="822"></A><BR>Her own shorn tresses on the corpse, her gift,
<A NAME="823"></A><BR>Her last, unto her lord.  Great jars of oil
<A NAME="824"></A><BR>Full many poured they out thereon, with jars
<A NAME="825"></A><BR>Of honey and of wine, rich blood of the grape
<A NAME="826"></A><BR>That breathed an odour as of nectar, yea,
<A NAME="827"></A><BR>Cast incense-breathing perfumes manifold
<A NAME="828"></A><BR>Marvellous sweet, the precious things put forth
<A NAME="829"></A><BR>By earth, and treasures of the sea divine.
<A NAME="830"></A><BR><BR>Then, when all things were set in readiness
<A NAME="831"></A><BR>About the pyre, all, footmen, charioteers,
<A NAME="832"></A><BR>Compassed that woeful bale, clashing their arms,
<A NAME="833"></A><BR>While, from the viewless heights Olympian, Zeus
<A NAME="834"></A><BR>Rained down ambrosia on dead Aeacus' son.
<A NAME="835"></A><BR>For honour to the Goddess, Nereus' child,
<A NAME="836"></A><BR>He sent to Aeolus Hermes, bidding him
<A NAME="837"></A><BR>Summon the sacred might of his swift winds,
<A NAME="838"></A><BR>For that the corpse of Aeacus' son must now
<A NAME="839"></A><BR>Be burned.  With speed he went, and Aeolus
<A NAME="840"></A><BR>Refused not: the tempestuous North in haste
<A NAME="841"></A><BR>He summoned, and the wild blast of the West;
<A NAME="842"></A><BR>And to Troy sped they on their whirlwind wings.
<A NAME="843"></A><BR>Fast in mad onrush, fast across the deep
<A NAME="844"></A><BR>They darted; roared beneath them as they flew
<A NAME="845"></A><BR>The sea, the land; above crashed thunder-voiced
<A NAME="846"></A><BR>Clouds headlong hurtling through the firmament.
<A NAME="847"></A><BR>Then by decree of Zeus down on the pyre
<A NAME="848"></A><BR>Of slain Achilles, like a charging host
<A NAME="849"></A><BR>Swooped they; upleapt the Fire-god's madding breath:
<A NAME="850"></A><BR>Uprose a long wail from the Myrmidons.
<A NAME="851"></A><BR>Then, though with whirlwind rushes toiled the winds,
<A NAME="852"></A><BR>All day, all night, they needs must fan the flames
<A NAME="853"></A><BR>Ere that death-pyre burned out.  Up to the heavens
<A NAME="854"></A><BR>Vast-volumed rolled the smoke.  The huge tree-trunks
<A NAME="855"></A><BR>Groaned, writhing, bursting, in the heat, and dropped
<A NAME="856"></A><BR>The dark-grey ash all round.  So when the winds
<A NAME="857"></A><BR>Had tirelessly fulfilled their mighty task,
<A NAME="858"></A><BR>Back to their cave they rode cloud-charioted.
<A NAME="859"></A><BR><BR>Then, when the fire had last of all consumed
<A NAME="860"></A><BR>That hero-king, when all the steeds, the men
<A NAME="861"></A><BR>Slain round the pyre had first been ravined up,
<A NAME="862"></A><BR>With all the costly offerings laid around
<A NAME="863"></A><BR>The mighty dead by Achaia's weeping sons,
<A NAME="864"></A><BR>The glowing embers did the Myrmidons quench
<A NAME="865"></A><BR>With wine.  Then clear to be discerned were seen
<A NAME="866"></A><BR>His bones; for nowise like the rest were they,
<A NAME="867"></A><BR>But like an ancient Giant's; none beside
<A NAME="868"></A><BR>With these were blent; for bulls and steeds, and 
<A NAME="869"></A>sons
<A NAME="870"></A><BR>Of Troy, with all that mingled hecatomb,
<A NAME="871"></A><BR>Lay in a wide ring round his corse, and he
<A NAME="872"></A><BR>Amidst them, flame-devoured, lay there alone.
<A NAME="873"></A><BR>So his companions groaning gathered up
<A NAME="874"></A><BR>His bones, and in a silver casket laid
<A NAME="875"></A><BR>Massy and deep, and banded and bestarred
<A NAME="876"></A><BR>With flashing gold; and Nereus' daughters shed
<A NAME="877"></A><BR>Ambrosia over them, and precious nards
<A NAME="878"></A><BR>For honour to Achilles: fat of kine
<A NAME="879"></A><BR>And amber honey poured they over all.
<A NAME="880"></A><BR>A golden vase his mother gave, the gift
<A NAME="881"></A><BR>In old time of the Wine-god, glorious work
<A NAME="882"></A><BR>Of the craft-master Fire-god, in the which
<A NAME="883"></A><BR>They laid the casket that enclosed the bones
<A NAME="884"></A><BR>Of mighty-souled Achilles.  All around
<A NAME="885"></A><BR>The Argives heaped a barrow, a giant sign,
<A NAME="886"></A><BR>Upon a foreland's uttermost end, beside
<A NAME="887"></A><BR>The Hellespont's deep waters, wailing loud
<A NAME="888"></A><BR>Farewells unto the Myrmidons' hero-king.
<A NAME="889"></A><BR><BR>Nor stayed the immortal steeds of Aeacus' son
<A NAME="890"></A><BR>Tearless beside the ships; they also mourned
<A NAME="891"></A><BR>Their slain king: sorely loth were they to abide
<A NAME="892"></A><BR>Longer mid mortal men or Argive steeds
<A NAME="893"></A><BR>Bearing a burden of consuming grief;
<A NAME="894"></A><BR>But fain were they to soar through air, afar
<A NAME="895"></A><BR>From wretched men, over the Ocean's streams,
<A NAME="896"></A><BR>Over the Sea-queen's caverns, unto where
<A NAME="897"></A><BR>Divine Podarge bare that storm-foot twain
<A NAME="898"></A><BR>Begotten of the West-wind clarion-voiced
<A NAME="899"></A><BR>Yea, and they had accomplished their desire,
<A NAME="900"></A><BR>But the Gods' purpose held them back, until
<A NAME="901"></A><BR>From Scyros' isle Achilles' fleetfoot son
<A NAME="902"></A><BR>Should come.  Him waited they to welcome, when
<A NAME="903"></A><BR>He came unto the war-host; for the Fates,
<A NAME="904"></A><BR>Daughters of holy Chaos, at their birth
<A NAME="905"></A><BR>Had spun the life-threads of those deathless foals,
<A NAME="906"></A><BR>Even to serve Poseidon first, and next
<A NAME="907"></A><BR>Peleus the dauntless king, Achilles then
<A NAME="908"></A><BR>The invincible, and, after these, the fourth,
<A NAME="909"></A><BR>The mighty-hearted Neoptolemus,
<A NAME="910"></A><BR>Whom after death to the Elysian Plain
<A NAME="911"></A><BR>They were to bear, unto the Blessed Land,
<A NAME="912"></A><BR>By Zeus' decree.  For which cause, though their 
<A NAME="913"></A>hearts
<A NAME="914"></A><BR>Were pierced with bitter anguish, they abode
<A NAME="915"></A><BR>Still by the ships, with spirits sorrowing
<A NAME="916"></A><BR>For their old lord, and yearning for the new.
<A NAME="917"></A><BR><BR>Then from the surge of heavy-plunging seas
<A NAME="918"></A><BR>Rose the Earth-shaker.  No man saw his feet
<A NAME="919"></A><BR>Pace up the strand, but suddenly he stood
<A NAME="920"></A><BR>Beside the Nereid Goddesses, and spake
<A NAME="921"></A><BR>To Thetis, yet for Achilles bowed with grief:
<A NAME="922"></A><BR>"Refrain from endless mourning for thy son.
<A NAME="923"></A><BR>Not with the dead shall he abide, but dwell
<A NAME="924"></A><BR>With Gods, as doth the might of Herakles,
<A NAME="925"></A><BR>And Dionysus ever fair.  Not him
<A NAME="926"></A><BR>Dread doom shall prison in darkness evermore,
<A NAME="927"></A><BR>Nor Hades keep him.  To the light of Zeus
<A NAME="928"></A><BR>Soon shall he rise; and I will give to him
<A NAME="929"></A><BR>A holy island for my gift: it lies
<A NAME="930"></A><BR>Within the Euxine Sea: there evermore
<A NAME="931"></A><BR>A God thy son shall be.  The tribes that dwell
<A NAME="932"></A><BR>Around shall as mine own self honour him
