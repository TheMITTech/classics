<A NAME="10"></A><B>How in the Funeral-Games of Achilles Heroes Contended</B>
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="11"></A>Nor did the hapless Trojans leave unwept
<A NAME="12"></A><BR>The warrior-king Hippolochus' hero-son,
<A NAME="13"></A><BR>But laid, in front of the Dardanian gate,
<A NAME="14"></A><BR>Upon the pyre that captain war-renowned.
<A NAME="15"></A><BR>But him Apollo's self caught swiftly up
<A NAME="16"></A><BR>Out of the blazing fire, and to the winds
<A NAME="17"></A><BR>Gave him, to bear away to Lycia-land;
<A NAME="18"></A><BR>And fast and far they bare him, 'neath the glens
<A NAME="19"></A><BR>Of high Telandrus, to a lovely glade;
<A NAME="20"></A><BR>And for a monument above his grave
<A NAME="21"></A><BR>Upheaved a granite rock. The Nymphs therefrom
<A NAME="22"></A><BR>Made gush the hallowed water of a stream
<A NAME="23"></A><BR>For ever flowing, which the tribes of men
<A NAME="24"></A><BR>Still call fair-fleeting Glaucus. This the gods
<A NAME="25"></A><BR>Wrought for an honour to the Lycian king.
<A NAME="26"></A><BR><BR>But for Achilles still the Argives mourned
<A NAME="27"></A><BR>Beside the swift ships: heart-sick were they all
<A NAME="28"></A><BR>With dolorous pain and grief.  Each yearned for 
<A NAME="29"></A>him
<A NAME="30"></A><BR>As for a son; no eye in that wide host
<A NAME="31"></A><BR>Was tearless.  But the Trojans with great joy
<A NAME="32"></A><BR>Exulted, seeing their sorrow from afar,
<A NAME="33"></A><BR>And the great fire that spake their foe consumed.
<A NAME="34"></A><BR>And thus a vaunting voice amidst them cried:
<A NAME="35"></A><BR>"Now hath Cronion from his heaven vouchsafed
<A NAME="36"></A><BR>A joy past hope unto our longing eyes,
<A NAME="37"></A><BR>To see Achilles fallen before Troy.
<A NAME="38"></A><BR>Now he is smitten down, the glorious hosts
<A NAME="39"></A><BR>Of Troy, I trow, shall win a breathing-space
<A NAME="40"></A><BR>From blood of death and from the murderous fray.
<A NAME="41"></A><BR>Ever his heart devised the Trojans' bane;
<A NAME="42"></A><BR>In his hands maddened aye the spear of doom
<A NAME="43"></A><BR>With gore besprent, and none of us that faced
<A NAME="44"></A><BR>Him in the fight beheld another dawn.
<A NAME="45"></A><BR>But now, I wot, Achaea's valorous sons
<A NAME="46"></A><BR>Shall flee unto their galleys shapely-prowed,
<A NAME="47"></A><BR>Since slain Achilles lies.  Ah that the might
<A NAME="48"></A><BR>Of Hector still were here, that he might slay
<A NAME="49"></A><BR>The Argives one and all amidst their tents!"
<A NAME="50"></A><BR><BR>So in unbridled joy a Trojan cried;
<A NAME="51"></A><BR>But one more wise and prudent answered him:
<A NAME="52"></A><BR>"Thou deemest that yon murderous Danaan host
<A NAME="53"></A><BR>Will straightway get them to the ships, to flee
<A NAME="54"></A><BR>Over the misty sea.  Nay, still their lust
<A NAME="55"></A><BR>Is hot for fight: us will they nowise fear,
<A NAME="56"></A><BR>Still are there left strong battle-eager men,
<A NAME="57"></A><BR>As Aias, as Tydeides, Atreus' sons:
<A NAME="58"></A><BR>Though dead Achilles be, I still fear these.
<A NAME="59"></A><BR>Oh that Apollo Silverbow would end them!
<A NAME="60"></A><BR>Then in that day were given to our prayers
<A NAME="61"></A><BR>A breathing-space from war and ghastly death."
<A NAME="62"></A><BR><BR>In heaven was dole among the Immortal Ones,
<A NAME="63"></A><BR>Even all that helped the stalwart Danaans' cause.
<A NAME="64"></A><BR>In clouds like mountains piled they veiled their 
<A NAME="65"></A>heads
<A NAME="66"></A><BR>For grief of soul.  But glad those others were
<A NAME="67"></A><BR>Who fain would speed Troy to a happy goal.
<A NAME="68"></A><BR>Then unto Cronos' Son great Hera spake:
<A NAME="69"></A><BR>"Zeus, Lightning-father, wherefore helpest thou
<A NAME="70"></A><BR>Troy, all forgetful of the fair-haired bride
<A NAME="71"></A><BR>Whom once to Peleus thou didst give to wife
<A NAME="72"></A><BR>Midst Pelion's glens?  Thyself didst bring to pass
<A NAME="73"></A><BR>Those spousals of a Goddess: on that day
<A NAME="74"></A><BR>All we Immortals feasted there, and gave
<A NAME="75"></A><BR>Gifts passing-fair.  All this dost thou forget,
<A NAME="76"></A><BR>And hast devised for Hellas heaviest woe."
<A NAME="77"></A><BR><BR>So spake she; but Zeus answered not a word;
<A NAME="78"></A><BR>For pondering there he sat with burdened breast,
<A NAME="79"></A><BR>Thinking how soon the Argives should destroy
<A NAME="80"></A><BR>The city of Priam, thinking how himself
<A NAME="81"></A><BR>Would visit on the victors ruin dread
<A NAME="82"></A><BR>In war and on the great sea thunder-voiced.
<A NAME="83"></A><BR>Such thoughts were his, ere long to be fulfilled.
<A NAME="84"></A><BR><BR>Now sank the sun to Ocean's fathomless flood:
<A NAME="85"></A><BR>O'er the dim land the infinite darkness stole,
<A NAME="86"></A><BR>Wherein men gain a little rest from toil.
<A NAME="87"></A><BR>Then by the ships, despite their sorrow, supped
<A NAME="88"></A><BR>The Argives, for ye cannot thrust aside
<A NAME="89"></A><BR>Hunger's importunate craving, when it comes
<A NAME="90"></A><BR>Upon the breast, but straightway heavy and faint
<A NAME="91"></A><BR>Lithe limbs become; nor is there remedy
<A NAME="92"></A><BR>Until one satisfy this clamorous guest
<A NAME="93"></A><BR>Therefore these ate the meat of eventide
<A NAME="94"></A><BR>In grief for Achilles' hard necessity
<A NAME="95"></A><BR>Constrained them all.  And, when they had broken 
<A NAME="96"></A>bread,
<A NAME="97"></A><BR>Sweet sleep came on them, loosening from their frames
<A NAME="98"></A><BR>Care's heavy chain, and quickening strength anew
<A NAME="99"></A><BR><BR>But when the starry Bears had eastward turned
<A NAME="100"></A><BR>Their heads, expectant of the uprushing light
<A NAME="101"></A><BR>Of Helios, and when woke the Queen of Dawn,
<A NAME="102"></A><BR>Then rose from sleep the stalwart Argive men
<A NAME="103"></A><BR>Purposing for the Trojans death and doom.
<A NAME="104"></A><BR>Stirred were they like the roughly-ridging sea
<A NAME="105"></A><BR>Icarian, or as sudden-rippling corn
<A NAME="106"></A><BR>In harvest field, what time the rushing wings
<A NAME="107"></A><BR>Of the cloud-gathering West sweep over it;
<A NAME="108"></A><BR>So upon Hellespont's strand the folk were stirred.
<A NAME="109"></A><BR>And to those eager hearts cried Tydeus' son:
<A NAME="110"></A><BR>"If we be battle-biders, friends, indeed,
<A NAME="111"></A><BR>More fiercely fight we now the hated foe,
<A NAME="112"></A><BR>Lest they take heart because Achilles lives
<A NAME="113"></A><BR>No longer.  Come, with armour, car, and steed
<A NAME="114"></A><BR>Let us beset them.  Glory waits our toil?"
<A NAME="115"></A><BR><BR>But battle-eager Aias answering spake
<A NAME="116"></A><BR>"Brave be thy words, and nowise idle talk,
<A NAME="117"></A><BR>Kindling the dauntless Argive men, whose hearts
<A NAME="118"></A><BR>Before were battle-eager, to the fight
<A NAME="119"></A><BR>Against the Trojan men, O Tydeus' son.
<A NAME="120"></A><BR>But we must needs abide amidst the ships
<A NAME="121"></A><BR>Till Goddess Thetis come forth of the sea;
<A NAME="122"></A><BR>For that her heart is purposed to set here
<A NAME="123"></A><BR>Fair athlete-prizes for the funeral-games.
<A NAME="124"></A><BR>This yesterday she told me, ere she plunged
<A NAME="125"></A><BR>Into sea-depths, yea, spake to me apart
<A NAME="126"></A><BR>From other Danaans; and, I trow, by this
<A NAME="127"></A><BR>Her haste hath brought her nigh.  Yon Trojan men,
<A NAME="128"></A><BR>Though Peleus' son hath died, shall have small heart
<A NAME="129"></A><BR>For battle, while myself am yet alive,
<A NAME="130"></A><BR>And thou, and noble Atreus' son, the king."
<A NAME="131"></A><BR><BR>So spake the mighty son of Telamon,
<A NAME="132"></A><BR>But knew not that a dark and bitter doom
<A NAME="133"></A><BR>For him should follow hard upon those games
<A NAME="134"></A><BR>By Fate's contrivance.  Answered Tydeus' son
<A NAME="135"></A><BR>"O friend, if Thetis comes indeed this day
<A NAME="136"></A><BR>With goodly gifts for her son's funeral-games,
<A NAME="137"></A><BR>Then bide we by the ships, and keep we here
<A NAME="138"></A><BR>All others.  Meet it is to do the will
<A NAME="139"></A><BR>Of the Immortals: yea, to Achilles too,
<A NAME="140"></A><BR>Though the Immortals willed it not, ourselves
<A NAME="141"></A><BR>Must render honour grateful to the dead."
<A NAME="142"></A><BR><BR>So spake the battle-eager Tydeus' son.
<A NAME="143"></A><BR>And lo, the Bride of Peleus gliding came
<A NAME="144"></A><BR>Forth of the sea, like the still breath of dawn,
<A NAME="145"></A><BR>And suddenly was with the Argive throng
<A NAME="146"></A><BR>Where eager-faced they waited, some, that looked
<A NAME="147"></A><BR>Soon to contend in that great athlete-strife,
<A NAME="148"></A><BR>And some, to joy in seeing the mighty strive.
<A NAME="149"></A><BR>Amidst that gathering Thetis sable-stoled
<A NAME="150"></A><BR>Set down her prizes, and she summoned forth
<A NAME="151"></A><BR>Achaea's champions: at her best they came.
<A NAME="152"></A><BR><BR>But first amidst them all rose Neleus' son,
<A NAME="153"></A><BR>Not as desiring in the strife of fists
<A NAME="154"></A><BR>To toil, nor strain of wrestling; for his arms
<A NAME="155"></A><BR>And all his sinews were with grievous eld
<A NAME="156"></A><BR>Outworn, but still his heart and brain were strong.
<A NAME="157"></A><BR>Of all the Achaeans none could match himself
<A NAME="158"></A><BR>Against him in the folkmote's war of words;
<A NAME="159"></A><BR>Yea, even Laertes' glorious son to him
<A NAME="160"></A><BR>Ever gave place when men for speech were met;
<A NAME="161"></A><BR>Nor he alone, but even the kingliest
<A NAME="162"></A><BR>Of Argives, Agamemnon, lord of spears.
<A NAME="163"></A><BR>Now in their midst he sang the gracious Queen
<A NAME="164"></A><BR>Of Nereids, sang how she in willsomeness
<A NAME="165"></A><BR>Of beauty was of all the Sea-maids chief.
<A NAME="166"></A><BR>Well-pleased she hearkened.  Yet again he sang,
<A NAME="167"></A><BR>Singing of Peleus' Bridal of Delight,
<A NAME="168"></A><BR>Which all the blest Immortals brought to pass
<A NAME="169"></A><BR>By Pelion's crests; sang of the ambrosial feast
<A NAME="170"></A><BR>When the swift Hours brought in immortal hands
<A NAME="171"></A><BR>Meats not of earth, and heaped in golden maunds;
<A NAME="172"></A><BR>Sang how the silver tables were set forth
<A NAME="173"></A><BR>In haste by Themis blithely laughing; sang
<A NAME="174"></A><BR>How breathed Hephaestus purest flame of fire;
<A NAME="175"></A><BR>Sang how the Nymphs in golden chalices
<A NAME="176"></A><BR>Mingled ambrosia; sang the ravishing dance
<A NAME="177"></A><BR>Twined by the Graces' feet; sang of the chant
<A NAME="178"></A><BR>The Muses raised, and how its spell enthralled
<A NAME="179"></A><BR>All mountains, rivers, all the forest brood;
<A NAME="180"></A><BR>How raptured was the infinite firmament,
<A NAME="181"></A><BR>Cheiron's fair caverns, yea, the very Gods.
<A NAME="182"></A><BR><BR>Such noble strain did Neleus' son pour out
<A NAME="183"></A><BR>Into the Argives' eager ears; and they
<A NAME="184"></A><BR>Hearkened with ravished souls.  Then in their midst
<A NAME="185"></A><BR>He sang once more the imperishable deeds
<A NAME="186"></A><BR>Of princely Achilles.  All the mighty throng
<A NAME="187"></A><BR>Acclaimed him with delight.  From that beginning
<A NAME="188"></A><BR>With fitly chosen words did he extol
<A NAME="189"></A><BR>The glorious hero; how he voyaged and smote
<A NAME="190"></A><BR>Twelve cities; how he marched o'er leagues on leagues
<A NAME="191"></A><BR>Of land, and spoiled eleven; how he slew
<A NAME="192"></A><BR>Telephus and Eetion's might renowned
<A NAME="193"></A><BR>In Thebe; how his spear laid Cyenus low,
<A NAME="194"></A><BR>Poseidon's son, and godlike Polydorus,
<A NAME="195"></A><BR>Troilus the goodly, princely Asteropaeus;
<A NAME="196"></A><BR>And how he dyed with blood the river-streams
<A NAME="197"></A><BR>Of Xanthus, and with countless corpses choked
<A NAME="198"></A><BR>His murmuring flow, when from the limbs he tore
<A NAME="199"></A><BR>Lycaon's life beside the sounding river;
<A NAME="200"></A><BR>And how he smote down Hector; how he slew
<A NAME="201"></A><BR>Penthesileia, and the godlike son
<A NAME="202"></A><BR>Of splendour-throned Dawn; -- all this he sang
<A NAME="203"></A><BR>To Argives which already knew the tale;
<A NAME="204"></A><BR>Sang of his giant mould, how no man's strength
<A NAME="205"></A><BR>In fight could stand against him, nor in games
<A NAME="206"></A><BR>Where strong men strive for mastery, where the swift
<A NAME="207"></A><BR>Contend with flying feet or hurrying wheels
<A NAME="208"></A><BR>Of chariots, nor in combat panoplied;
<A NAME="209"></A><BR>And how in goodlihead he far outshone
<A NAME="210"></A><BR>All Danaans, and how his bodily might
<A NAME="211"></A><BR>Was measureless in the stormy clash of war.
<A NAME="212"></A><BR>Last, he prayed Heaven that he might see a son
<A NAME="213"></A><BR>Like that great sire from sea-washed Scyros come.
<A NAME="214"></A><BR><BR>That noble song acclaiming Argives praised;
<A NAME="215"></A><BR>Yea, silver-looted Thetis smiled, and gave
<A NAME="216"></A><BR>The singer fleetfoot horses, given of old
<A NAME="217"></A><BR>Beside Caicus' mouth by Telephus
<A NAME="218"></A><BR>To Achilles, when he healed the torturing wound
<A NAME="219"></A><BR>With that same spear wherewith himself had pierced
<A NAME="220"></A><BR>Telephus' thigh, and thrust the point clear through.
<A NAME="221"></A><BR>These Nestor Neleus' son to his comrades gave,
<A NAME="222"></A><BR>And, glorying in their godlike lord, they led
<A NAME="223"></A><BR>The steeds unto his ships.  Then Thetis set
<A NAME="224"></A><BR>Amidst the athlete-ring ten kine, to be
<A NAME="225"></A><BR>Her prizes for the footrace, and by each
<A NAME="226"></A><BR>Ran a fair suckling calf.  These the bold might
<A NAME="227"></A><BR>Of Peleus' tireless son had driven down
<A NAME="228"></A><BR>From slopes of Ida, prizes of his spear.
<A NAME="229"></A><BR><BR>To strive for these rose up two victory-fain,
<A NAME="230"></A><BR>Teucer the first, the son of Telamon,
<A NAME="231"></A><BR>And Aias, of the Locrian archers chief.
<A NAME="232"></A><BR>These twain with swift hands girded them about
<A NAME="233"></A><BR>With loin-cloths, reverencing the Goddess-bride
<A NAME="234"></A><BR>Of Peleus, and the Sea-maids, who with her
<A NAME="235"></A><BR>Came to behold the Argives' athlete-sport.
<A NAME="236"></A><BR>And Atreus' son, lord of all Argive men,
<A NAME="237"></A><BR>Showed them the turning-goal of that swift course.
<A NAME="238"></A><BR>Then these the Queen of Rivalry spurred on,
<A NAME="239"></A><BR>As from the starting-line like falcons swift
<A NAME="240"></A><BR>They sped away.  Long doubtful was the race:
<A NAME="241"></A><BR>Now, as the Argives gazed, would Aias' friends
<A NAME="242"></A><BR>Shout, now rang out the answering cheer from friends
<A NAME="243"></A><BR>Of Teucer.  But when in their eager speed
<A NAME="244"></A><BR>Close on the end they were, then Teucer's feet
<A NAME="245"></A><BR>Were trammelled by unearthly powers: some god
<A NAME="246"></A><BR>Or demon dashed his foot against the stock
<A NAME="247"></A><BR>Of a deep-rooted tamarisk.  Sorely wrenched
<A NAME="248"></A><BR>Was his left ankle: round the joint upswelled
<A NAME="249"></A><BR>The veins high-ridged.  A great shout rang from 
<A NAME="250"></A>all
<A NAME="251"></A><BR>That watched the contest.  Aias darted past
<A NAME="252"></A><BR>Exultant: ran his Locrian folk to hail
<A NAME="253"></A><BR>Their lord, with sudden joy in all their souls.
<A NAME="254"></A><BR>Then to his ships they drave the kine, and cast
<A NAME="255"></A><BR>Fodder before them.  Eager-helpful friends
<A NAME="256"></A><BR>Led Teucer halting thence.  The leeches drew
<A NAME="257"></A><BR>Blood from his foot: then over it they laid
<A NAME="258"></A><BR>Soft-shredded linen ointment-smeared, and swathed
<A NAME="259"></A><BR>With smooth bands round, and charmed away the pain.
<A NAME="260"></A><BR><BR>Then swiftly rose two mighty-hearted ones
<A NAME="261"></A><BR>Eager to match their strength in wrestling strain,
<A NAME="262"></A><BR>The son of Tydeus and the giant Aias.
<A NAME="263"></A><BR>Into the midst they strode, and marvelling gazed
<A NAME="264"></A><BR>The Argives on men shapen like to gods.
<A NAME="265"></A><BR>Then grappled they, like lions famine-stung
<A NAME="266"></A><BR>Fighting amidst the mountains o'er a stag,
<A NAME="267"></A><BR>Whose strength is even-balanced; no whit less
<A NAME="268"></A><BR>Is one than other in their deadly rage;
<A NAME="269"></A><BR>So these long time in might were even-matched,
<A NAME="270"></A><BR>Till Aias locked his strong hands round the son
<A NAME="271"></A><BR>Of Tydeus, straining hard to break his back;
<A NAME="272"></A><BR>But he, with wrestling-craft and strength combined,
<A NAME="273"></A><BR>Shifted his hip 'neath Telamon's son, and heaved
<A NAME="274"></A><BR>The giant up; with a side-twist wrenched free
<A NAME="275"></A><BR>From Aias' ankle-lock his thigh, and so
<A NAME="276"></A><BR>With one huge shoulder-heave to earth he threw
<A NAME="277"></A><BR>That mighty champion, and himself came down
<A NAME="278"></A><BR>Astride him: then a mighty shout went up.
<A NAME="279"></A><BR>But battle-stormer Aias, chafed in mind,
<A NAME="280"></A><BR>Sprang up, hot-eager to essay again
<A NAME="281"></A><BR>That grim encounter.  From his terrible hands
<A NAME="282"></A><BR>He dashed the dust, and challenged furiously
<A NAME="283"></A><BR>With a great voice Tydeides: not a whit
<A NAME="284"></A><BR>That other quailed, but rushed to close with him.
<A NAME="285"></A><BR>Rolled up the dust in clouds from 'neath their feet:
<A NAME="286"></A><BR>Hurtling they met like battling mountain-bulls
<A NAME="287"></A><BR>That clash to prove their dauntless strength, and 
<A NAME="288"></A>spurn
<A NAME="289"></A><BR>The dust, while with their roaring all the hills
<A NAME="290"></A><BR>Re-echo: in their desperate fury these
<A NAME="291"></A><BR>Dash their strong heads together, straining long
<A NAME="292"></A><BR>Against each other with their massive strength,
<A NAME="293"></A><BR>Hard-panting in the fierce rage of their strife,
<A NAME="294"></A><BR>While from their mouths drip foam-flakes to the 
<A NAME="295"></A>ground;
<A NAME="296"></A><BR>So strained they twain with grapple of brawny hands.
<A NAME="297"></A><BR>'Neath that hard grip their backs and sinewy necks
<A NAME="298"></A><BR>Cracked, even as when in mountain-glades the trees
<A NAME="299"></A><BR>Dash storm-tormented boughs together.  Oft
<A NAME="300"></A><BR>Tydeides clutched at Aias' brawny thighs,
<A NAME="301"></A><BR>But could not stir his steadfast-rooted feet.
<A NAME="302"></A><BR>Oft Aias hurled his whole weight on him, bowed
<A NAME="303"></A><BR>His shoulders backward, strove to press him down;
<A NAME="304"></A><BR>And to new grips their hands were shifting aye.
<A NAME="305"></A><BR>All round the gazing people shouted, some
<A NAME="306"></A><BR>Cheering on glorious Tydeus' son, and some
<A NAME="307"></A><BR>The might of Aias.  Then the giant swung
<A NAME="308"></A><BR>The shoulders of his foe to right, to left;
<A NAME="309"></A><BR>Then gripped him 'neath the waist; with one fierce 
<A NAME="310"></A>heave
<A NAME="311"></A><BR>And giant effort hurled him like a stone
<A NAME="312"></A><BR>To earth.  The floor of Troyland rang again
<A NAME="313"></A><BR>As fell Tydeides: shouted all the folk.
<A NAME="314"></A><BR>Yet leapt he up all eager to contend
<A NAME="315"></A><BR>With giant Aias for the third last fall:
<A NAME="316"></A><BR>But Nestor rose and spake unto the twain:
<A NAME="317"></A><BR>"From grapple of wrestling, noble sons, forbear;
<A NAME="318"></A><BR>For all we know that ye be mightiest
<A NAME="319"></A><BR>Of Argives since the great Achilles died."
<A NAME="320"></A><BR><BR>Then these from toil refrained, and from their 
<A NAME="321"></A>brows
<A NAME="322"></A><BR>Wiped with their hands the plenteous-streaming sweat:
<A NAME="323"></A><BR>They kissed each other, and forgat their strife.
<A NAME="324"></A><BR>Then Thetis, queen of Goddesses, gave to them
<A NAME="325"></A><BR>Four handmaids; and those strong and aweless ones
<A NAME="326"></A><BR>Marvelled beholding them, for these surpassed
<A NAME="327"></A><BR>All captive-maids in beauty and household-skill,
<A NAME="328"></A><BR>Save only lovely-tressed Briseis.  These
<A NAME="329"></A><BR>Achilles captive brought from Lesbos' Isle,
<A NAME="330"></A><BR>And in their service joyed.  The first was made
<A NAME="331"></A><BR>Stewardess of the feast and lady of meats;
<A NAME="332"></A><BR>The second to the feasters poured the wine;
<A NAME="333"></A><BR>The third shed water on their hands thereafter;
<A NAME="334"></A><BR>The fourth bare all away, the banquet done.
<A NAME="335"></A><BR>These Tydeus' son and giant Aias shared,
<A NAME="336"></A><BR>And, parted two and two, unto their ships
<A NAME="337"></A><BR>Sent they those fair and serviceable ones.
<A NAME="338"></A><BR><BR>Next, for the play of fists Idomeneus rose,
<A NAME="339"></A><BR>For cunning was he in all athlete-lore;
<A NAME="340"></A><BR>But none came forth to meet him, yielding all
<A NAME="341"></A><BR>To him, the elder-born, with reverent awe.
<A NAME="342"></A><BR>So in their midst gave Thetis unto him
<A NAME="343"></A><BR>A chariot and fleet steeds, which theretofore
<A NAME="344"></A><BR>Mighty Patroclus from the ranks of Troy
<A NAME="345"></A><BR>Drave, when he slew Sarpedon, seed of Zeus,
<A NAME="346"></A><BR>These to his henchmen gave Idomeneus
<A NAME="347"></A><BR>To drive unto the ships: himself remained
<A NAME="348"></A><BR>Still sitting in the glorious athlete-ring.
<A NAME="349"></A><BR>Then Phoenix to the stalwart Argives cried:
<A NAME="350"></A><BR>"Now to Idomeneus the Gods have given
<A NAME="351"></A><BR>A fair prize uncontested, free of toil
<A NAME="352"></A><BR>Of mighty arms and shoulders, honouring
<A NAME="353"></A><BR>The elder-born with bloodless victory.
<A NAME="354"></A><BR>But lo, ye younger men, another prize
<A NAME="355"></A><BR>Awaiteth the swift play of cunning hands.
<A NAME="356"></A><BR>Step forth then: gladden great Peleides' soul."
<A NAME="357"></A><BR><BR>He spake, they heard; but each on other looked,
<A NAME="358"></A><BR>And, loth to essay the contest, all sat still,
<A NAME="359"></A><BR>Till Neleus' son rebuked those laggard souls:
<A NAME="360"></A><BR>"Friends, it were shame that men should shun the 
<A NAME="361"></A>play
<A NAME="362"></A><BR>Of clenched hands, who in that noble sport
<A NAME="363"></A><BR>Have skill, wherein young men delight, which links
<A NAME="364"></A><BR>Glory to toil.  Ah that my thews were strong
<A NAME="365"></A><BR>As when we held King Pelias' funeral-feast,
<A NAME="366"></A><BR>I and Acastus, kinsmen joining hands,
<A NAME="367"></A><BR>When I with godlike Polydeuces stood
<A NAME="368"></A><BR>In gauntlet-strife, in even-balanced fray,
<A NAME="369"></A><BR>And when Ancaeus in the wrestlers' ring
<A NAME="370"></A><BR>Mightier than all beside, yet feared and shrank
<A NAME="371"></A><BR>From me, and dared not strive with me that day,
<A NAME="372"></A><BR>For that ere then amidst the Epeian men --
<A NAME="373"></A><BR>No battle-blenchers they! -- I had vanquished him,
<A NAME="374"></A><BR>For all his might, and dashed him to the dust
<A NAME="375"></A><BR>By dead Amaryncus' tomb, and thousands round
<A NAME="376"></A><BR>Sat marvelling at my prowess and my strength.
<A NAME="377"></A><BR>Therefore against me not a second time
<A NAME="378"></A><BR>Raised he his hands, strong wrestler though he were;
<A NAME="379"></A><BR>And so I won an uncontested prize.
<A NAME="380"></A><BR>But now old age is on me, and many griefs.
<A NAME="381"></A><BR>Therefore I bid you, whom it well beseems,
<A NAME="382"></A><BR>To win the prize; for glory crowns the youth
<A NAME="383"></A><BR>Who bears away the meed of athlete-strife."
<A NAME="384"></A><BR><BR>Stirred by his gallant chiding, a brave man
<A NAME="385"></A><BR>Rose, son of haughty godlike Panopeus,
<A NAME="386"></A><BR>The man who framed the Horse, the bane of Troy,
<A NAME="387"></A><BR>Not long thereafter.  None dared meet him now
<A NAME="388"></A><BR>In play of fists, albeit in deadly craft
<A NAME="389"></A><BR>Of war, when Ares rusheth through the field,
<A NAME="390"></A><BR>He was not cunning.  But for strife of hands
<A NAME="391"></A><BR>The fair prize uncontested had been won
<A NAME="392"></A><BR>By stout Epeius -- yea, he was at point
<A NAME="393"></A><BR>To bear it thence unto the Achaean ships;
<A NAME="394"></A><BR>But one strode forth to meet him, Theseus' son,
<A NAME="395"></A><BR>The spearman Acamas, the mighty of heart,
<A NAME="396"></A><BR>Bearing already on his swift hands girt
<A NAME="397"></A><BR>The hard hide-gauntlets, which Evenor's son
<A NAME="398"></A><BR>Agelaus on his prince's hands had drawn
<A NAME="399"></A><BR>With courage-kindling words.  The comrades then
<A NAME="400"></A><BR>Of Panopeus' princely son for Epeius raised
<A NAME="401"></A><BR>A heartening cheer.  He like a lion stood
<A NAME="402"></A><BR>Forth in the midst, his strong hands gauntleted
<A NAME="403"></A><BR>With bull's hide hard as horn.  Loud rang the cheers
<A NAME="404"></A><BR>From side to side of that great throng, to fire
<A NAME="405"></A><BR>The courage of the mighty ones to clash
<A NAME="406"></A><BR>Hands in the gory play.  Sooth, little spur
<A NAME="407"></A><BR>Needed they for their eagerness for fight.
<A NAME="408"></A><BR>But, ere they closed, they flashed out proving blows
<A NAME="409"></A><BR>To wot if still, as theretofore, their arms
<A NAME="410"></A><BR>Were limber and lithe, unclogged by toil of war;
<A NAME="411"></A><BR>Then faced each other, and upraised their hands
<A NAME="412"></A><BR>With ever-watching eyes, and short quick steps
<A NAME="413"></A><BR>A-tiptoe, and with ever-shifting feet,
<A NAME="414"></A><BR>Each still eluding other's crushing might.
<A NAME="415"></A><BR>Then with a rush they closed like thunder-clouds
<A NAME="416"></A><BR>Hurled on each other by the tempest-blast,
<A NAME="417"></A><BR>Flashing forth lightnings, while the welkin thrills
<A NAME="418"></A><BR>As clash the clouds and hollow roar the winds;
<A NAME="419"></A><BR>So 'neath the hard hide-gauntlets clashed their 
<A NAME="420"></A>jaws.
<A NAME="421"></A><BR>Down streamed the blood, and from their brows the 
<A NAME="422"></A>sweat
<A NAME="423"></A><BR>Blood-streaked made on the flushed cheeks crimson 
<A NAME="424"></A>bars.
<A NAME="425"></A><BR>Fierce without pause they fought, and never flagged
<A NAME="426"></A><BR>Epeius, but threw all his stormy strength
<A NAME="427"></A><BR>Into his onrush.  Yet did Theseus' son
<A NAME="428"></A><BR>Never lose heart, but baffled the straight blows
<A NAME="429"></A><BR>Of those strong hands, and by his fighting-craft
<A NAME="430"></A><BR>Flinging them right and left, leapt in, brought 
<A NAME="431"></A>home
<A NAME="432"></A><BR>A blow to his eyebrow, cutting to the bone.
<A NAME="433"></A><BR>Even then with counter-stroke Epeius reached
<A NAME="434"></A><BR>Acamas' temple, and hurled him to the ground.
<A NAME="435"></A><BR>Swift he sprang up, and on his stalwart foe
<A NAME="436"></A><BR>Rushed, smote his head: as he rushed in again,
<A NAME="437"></A><BR>The other, slightly swerving, sent his left
<A NAME="438"></A><BR>Clean to his brow; his right, with all his might
<A NAME="439"></A><BR>Behind it, to his nose.  Yet Acamas still
<A NAME="440"></A><BR>Warded and struck with all the manifold shifts
<A NAME="441"></A><BR>Of fighting-craft.  But now the Achaeans all
<A NAME="442"></A><BR>Bade stop the fight, though eager still were both
<A NAME="443"></A><BR>To strive for coveted victory.  Then came
<A NAME="444"></A><BR>Their henchmen, and the gory gauntlets loosed
<A NAME="445"></A><BR>In haste from those strong hands.  Now drew they 
<A NAME="446"></A>breath
<A NAME="447"></A><BR>From that great labour, as they bathed their brows
<A NAME="448"></A><BR>With sponges myriad-pored.  Comrades and friends
<A NAME="449"></A><BR>With pleading words then drew them face to face,
<A NAME="450"></A><BR>And prayed, "In friendship straight forget your 
<A NAME="451"></A>wrath."
<A NAME="452"></A><BR>So to their comrades' suasion hearkened they;
<A NAME="453"></A><BR>For wise men ever bear a placable mind.
<A NAME="454"></A><BR>They kissed each other, and their hearts forgat
<A NAME="455"></A><BR>That bitter strife.  Then Thetis sable-stoled
<A NAME="456"></A><BR>Gave to their glad hands two great silver bowls
<A NAME="457"></A><BR>The which Euneus, Jason's warrior son
<A NAME="458"></A><BR>In sea-washed Lemnos to Achilles gave
<A NAME="459"></A><BR>To ransom strong Lycaon from his hands.
<A NAME="460"></A><BR>These had Hephaestus fashioned for his gift
<A NAME="461"></A><BR>To glorious Dionysus, when he brought
<A NAME="462"></A><BR>His bride divine to Olympus, Minos' child
<A NAME="463"></A><BR>Far-famous, whom in sea-washed Dia's isle
<A NAME="464"></A><BR>Theseus unwitting left.  The Wine-god brimmed
<A NAME="465"></A><BR>With nectar these, and gave them to his son;
<A NAME="466"></A><BR>And Thoas at his death to Hypsipyle
<A NAME="467"></A><BR>With great possessions left them.  She bequeathed
<A NAME="468"></A><BR>The bowls to her godlike son, who gave them up
<A NAME="469"></A><BR>Unto Achilles for Lycaon's life.
<A NAME="470"></A><BR>The one the son of lordly Theseus took,
<A NAME="471"></A><BR>And goodly Epeius sent to his ship with joy
<A NAME="472"></A><BR>The other.  Then their bruises and their scars
<A NAME="473"></A><BR>Did Podaleirius tend with loving care.
<A NAME="474"></A><BR>First pressed he out black humours, then his hands
<A NAME="475"></A><BR>Deftly knit up the gashes: salves he laid
<A NAME="476"></A><BR>Thereover, given him by his sire of old,
<A NAME="477"></A><BR>Such as had virtue in one day to heal
<A NAME="478"></A><BR>The deadliest hurts, yea, seeming-cureless wounds.
<A NAME="479"></A><BR>Straight was the smart assuaged, and healed the 
<A NAME="480"></A>scars
<A NAME="481"></A><BR>Upon their brows and 'neath their clustering hair
<A NAME="482"></A><BR><BR>Then for the archery-test Oileus' son
<A NAME="483"></A><BR>Stood forth with Teucer, they which in the race
<A NAME="484"></A><BR>Erewhile contended.  Far away from these
<A NAME="485"></A><BR>Agamemnon, lord of spears, set up a helm
<A NAME="486"></A><BR>Crested with plumes, and spake: "The master-shot
<A NAME="487"></A><BR>Is that which shears the hair-crest clean away."
<A NAME="488"></A><BR>Then straightway Aias shot his arrow first,
<A NAME="489"></A><BR>And smote the helm-ridge: sharply rang the brass.
<A NAME="490"></A><BR>Then Teucer second with most earnest heed
<A NAME="491"></A><BR>Shot: the swift shaft hath shorn the plume away.
<A NAME="492"></A><BR>Loud shouted all the people as they gazed,
<A NAME="493"></A><BR>And praised him without stint, for still his foot
<A NAME="494"></A><BR>Halted in pain, yet nowise marred his aim
<A NAME="495"></A><BR>When with his hands he sped the flying shaft.
<A NAME="496"></A><BR>Then Peleus' bride gave unto him the arms
<A NAME="497"></A><BR>Of godlike Troilus, the goodliest
<A NAME="498"></A><BR>Of all fair sons whom Hecuba had borne
<A NAME="499"></A><BR>In hallowed Troy; yet of his goodlihead
<A NAME="500"></A><BR>No joy she had; the prowess and the spear
<A NAME="501"></A><BR>Of fell Achilles reft his life from him.
<A NAME="502"></A><BR>As when a gardener with new-whetted scythe
<A NAME="503"></A><BR>Mows down, ere it may seed, a blade of corn
<A NAME="504"></A><BR>Or poppy, in a garden dewy-fresh
<A NAME="505"></A><BR>And blossom-flushed, which by a water-course
<A NAME="506"></A><BR>Crowdeth its blooms -- mows it ere it may reach
<A NAME="507"></A><BR>Its goal of bringing offspring to the birth,
<A NAME="508"></A><BR>And with his scythe-sweep makes its life-work vain
<A NAME="509"></A><BR>And barren of all issue, nevermore
<A NAME="510"></A><BR>Now to be fostered by the dews of spring;
<A NAME="511"></A><BR>So did Peleides cut down Priam's son
<A NAME="512"></A><BR>The god-like beautiful, the beardless yet
<A NAME="513"></A><BR>And virgin of a bride, almost a child!
<A NAME="514"></A><BR>Yet the Destroyer Fate had lured him on
<A NAME="515"></A><BR>To war, upon the threshold of glad youth,
<A NAME="516"></A><BR>When youth is bold, and the heart feels no void.
<A NAME="517"></A><BR><BR>Forthwith a bar of iron massy and long
<A NAME="518"></A><BR>From the swift-speeding hand did many essay
<A NAME="519"></A><BR>To hurl; but not an Argive could prevail
<A NAME="520"></A><BR>To cast that ponderous mass.  Aias alone
<A NAME="521"></A><BR>Sped it from his strong hand, as in the time
<A NAME="522"></A><BR>Of harvest might a reaper fling from him
<A NAME="523"></A><BR>A dry oak-bough, when all the fields are parched.
<A NAME="524"></A><BR>And all men marvelled to behold how far
<A NAME="525"></A><BR>Flew from his hand the bronze which scarce two men
<A NAME="526"></A><BR>Hard-straining had uplifted from the ground.
<A NAME="527"></A><BR>Even this Antaeus' might was wont to hurl
<A NAME="528"></A><BR>Erstwhile, ere the strong hands of Hercules
<A NAME="529"></A><BR>O'ermastered him.  This, with much spoil beside,
<A NAME="530"></A><BR>Hercules took, and kept it to make sport
<A NAME="531"></A><BR>For his invincible hand; but afterward
<A NAME="532"></A><BR>Gave it to valiant Peleus, who with him
<A NAME="533"></A><BR>Had smitten fair-towered Ilium's burg renowned;
<A NAME="534"></A><BR>And he to Achilles gave it, whose swift ships
<A NAME="535"></A><BR>Bare it to Troy, to put him aye in mind
<A NAME="536"></A><BR>Of his own father, as with eager will
<A NAME="537"></A><BR>He fought with stalwart Trojans, and to be
<A NAME="538"></A><BR>A worthy test wherewith to prove his strength.
<A NAME="539"></A><BR>Even this did Aias from his brawny hand
<A NAME="540"></A><BR>Fling far.  So then the Nereid gave to him
<A NAME="541"></A><BR>The glorious arms from godlike Memnon stripped.
<A NAME="542"></A><BR>Marvelling the Argives gazed on them: they were
<A NAME="543"></A><BR>A giant's war-gear.  Laughing a glad laugh
<A NAME="544"></A><BR>That man renowned received them: he alone
<A NAME="545"></A><BR>Could wear them on his brawny limbs; they seemed
<A NAME="546"></A><BR>As they had even been moulded to his frame.
<A NAME="547"></A><BR>The great bar thence he bore withal, to be
<A NAME="548"></A><BR>His joy when he was fain of athlete-toil.
<A NAME="549"></A><BR><BR>Still sped the contests on; and many rose
<A NAME="550"></A><BR>Now for the leaping.  Far beyond the marks
<A NAME="551"></A><BR>Of all the rest brave Agapenor sprang:
<A NAME="552"></A><BR>Loud shouted all for that victorious leap;
<A NAME="553"></A><BR>And Thetis gave him the fair battle-gear
<A NAME="554"></A><BR>Of mighty Cycnus, who had smitten first
<A NAME="555"></A><BR>Protesilaus, then had reft the life
<A NAME="556"></A><BR>From many more, till Peleus' son slew him
<A NAME="557"></A><BR>First of the chiefs of grief-enshrouded Troy.
<A NAME="558"></A><BR><BR>Next, in the javelin-cast Euryalus
<A NAME="559"></A><BR>Hurled far beyond all rivals, while the folk
<A NAME="560"></A><BR>Shouted aloud: no archer, so they deemed,
<A NAME="561"></A><BR>Could speed a winged shaft farther than his cast;
<A NAME="562"></A><BR>Therefore the Aeacid hero's mother gave
<A NAME="563"></A><BR>To him a deep wide silver oil-flask, ta'en
<A NAME="564"></A><BR>By Achilles in possession, when his spear
<A NAME="565"></A><BR>Slew Mynes, and he spoiled Lyrnessus' wealth.
<A NAME="566"></A><BR><BR>Then fiery-hearted Aias eagerly
<A NAME="567"></A><BR>Rose, challenging to strife of hands and feet
<A NAME="568"></A><BR>The mightiest hero there; but marvelling
<A NAME="569"></A><BR>They marked his mighty thews, and no man dared
<A NAME="570"></A><BR>Confront him.  Chilling dread had palsied all
<A NAME="571"></A><BR>Their courage: from their hearts they feared him, 
<A NAME="572"></A>lest
<A NAME="573"></A><BR>His hands invincible should all to-break
<A NAME="574"></A><BR>His adversary's face, and naught but pain
<A NAME="575"></A><BR>Be that man's meed.  But at the last all men
<A NAME="576"></A><BR>Made signs to battle-bider Euryalus,
<A NAME="577"></A><BR>For well they knew him skilled in fighting-craft;
<A NAME="578"></A><BR>But he too feared that giant, and he cried:
<A NAME="579"></A><BR>"Friends, any other Achaean, whom ye will,
<A NAME="580"></A><BR>Blithe will I face; but mighty Alas -- no!
<A NAME="581"></A><BR>Far doth he overmatch me.  He will rend
<A NAME="582"></A><BR>Mine heart, if in the onset anger rise
<A NAME="583"></A><BR>Within him: from his hands invincible,
<A NAME="584"></A><BR>I trow, I should not win to the ships alive."
<A NAME="585"></A><BR><BR>Loud laughed they all: but glowed with triumph-joy
<A NAME="586"></A><BR>The heart of Aias.  Gleaming talents twain
<A NAME="587"></A><BR>Of silver he from Thetis' hands received,
<A NAME="588"></A><BR>His uncontested prize.  His stately height
<A NAME="589"></A><BR>Called to her mind her dear son, and she sighed.
<A NAME="590"></A><BR><BR>They which had skill in chariot-driving then
<A NAME="591"></A><BR>Rose at the contest's summons eagerly:
<A NAME="592"></A><BR>Menelaus first, Eurypylus bold in fight,
<A NAME="593"></A><BR>Eumelus, Thoas, godlike Polypoetes
<A NAME="594"></A><BR>Harnessed their steeds, and led them to the cars
<A NAME="595"></A><BR>All panting for the joy of victory.
<A NAME="596"></A><BR>Then rode they in a glittering chariot rank
<A NAME="597"></A><BR>Out to one place, to a stretch of sand, and stood
<A NAME="598"></A><BR>Ranged at the starting-line.  The reins they grasped
<A NAME="599"></A><BR>In strong hands quickly, while the chariot-steeds
<A NAME="600"></A><BR>Shoulder to shoulder fretted, all afire
<A NAME="601"></A><BR>To take the lead at starting, pawed the sand,
<A NAME="602"></A><BR>Pricked ears, and o'er their frontlets flung the 
<A NAME="603"></A>foam.
<A NAME="604"></A><BR>With sudden-stiffened sinews those ear-lords
<A NAME="605"></A><BR>Lashed with their whips the tempest-looted steeds;
<A NAME="606"></A><BR>Then swift as Harpies sprang they forth; they strained
<A NAME="607"></A><BR>Furiously at the harness, onward whirling
<A NAME="608"></A><BR>The chariots bounding ever from the earth.
<A NAME="609"></A><BR>Thou couldst not see a wheel-track, no, nor print
<A NAME="610"></A><BR>Of hoof upon the sand -- they verily flew.
<A NAME="611"></A><BR>Up from the plain the dust-clouds to the sky
<A NAME="612"></A><BR>Soared, like the smoke of burning, or a mist
<A NAME="613"></A><BR>Rolled round the mountain-forelands by the might
<A NAME="614"></A><BR>Of the dark South-wind or the West, when wakes
<A NAME="615"></A><BR>A tempest, when the hill-sides stream with rain.
<A NAME="616"></A><BR>Burst to the front Eumelus' steeds: behind
<A NAME="617"></A><BR>Close pressed the team of godlike Thoas: shouts
<A NAME="618"></A><BR>Still answered shouts that cheered each chariot, 
<A NAME="619"></A>while
<A NAME="620"></A><BR>Onward they swept across the wide-wayed plain.
<A NAME="621"></A><BR><BR>((LACUNA))
<A NAME="622"></A><BR><BR>"From hallowed Elis, when he had achieved
<A NAME="623"></A><BR>A mighty triumph, in that he outstripped
<A NAME="624"></A><BR>The swift ear of Oenomaus evil-souled,
<A NAME="625"></A><BR>The ruthless slayer of youths who sought to wed
<A NAME="626"></A><BR>His daughter Hippodameia passing-wise.
<A NAME="627"></A><BR>Yet even he, for all his chariot-lore,
<A NAME="628"></A><BR>Had no such fleetfoot steeds as Atreus' son --
<A NAME="629"></A><BR>Far slower! -- the wind is in the feet of these."
<A NAME="630"></A><BR><BR>So spake he, giving glory to the might
<A NAME="631"></A><BR>Of those good steeds, and to Atreides' self;
<A NAME="632"></A><BR>And filled with joy was Menelaus' soul.
<A NAME="633"></A><BR>Straightway his henchmen from the yoke-band loosed
<A NAME="634"></A><BR>The panting team, and all those chariot-lords,
<A NAME="635"></A><BR>Who in the race had striven, now unyoked
<A NAME="636"></A><BR>Their tempest-footed steeds.  Podaleirius then
<A NAME="637"></A><BR>Hasted to spread salves over all the wounds
<A NAME="638"></A><BR>Of Thoas and Eurypylus, gashes scored
<A NAME="639"></A><BR>Upon their frames when from the cars they fell
<A NAME="640"></A><BR>But Menelaus with exceeding joy
<A NAME="641"></A><BR>Of victory glowed, when Thetis 1ovely-tressed
<A NAME="642"></A><BR>Gave him a golden cup, the chief possession
<A NAME="643"></A><BR>Once of Eetion the godlike; ere
<A NAME="644"></A><BR>Achilles spoiled the far-famed burg of Thebes.
<A NAME="645"></A><BR><BR>Then horsemen riding upon horses came
<A NAME="646"></A><BR>Down to the course: they grasped in hand the whip
<A NAME="647"></A><BR>And bounding from the earth bestrode their steeds,
<A NAME="648"></A><BR>The while with foaming mouths the coursers champed
<A NAME="649"></A><BR>The bits, and pawed the ground, and fretted aye
<A NAME="650"></A><BR>To dash into the course.  Forth from the line
<A NAME="651"></A><BR>Swiftly they darted, eager for the strife,
<A NAME="652"></A><BR>Wild as the blasts of roaring Boreas
<A NAME="653"></A><BR>Or shouting Notus, when with hurricane-swoop
<A NAME="654"></A><BR>He heaves the wide sea high, when in the east
<A NAME="655"></A><BR>Uprises the disastrous Altar-star
<A NAME="656"></A><BR>Bringing calamity to seafarers;
<A NAME="657"></A><BR>So swift they rushed, spurning with flying feet
<A NAME="658"></A><BR>The deep dust on the plain.  The riders cried
<A NAME="659"></A><BR>Each to his steed, and ever plied the lash
<A NAME="660"></A><BR>And shook the reins about the clashing bits.
<A NAME="661"></A><BR>On strained the horses: from the people rose
<A NAME="662"></A><BR>A shouting like the roaring of a sea.
<A NAME="663"></A><BR>On, on across the level plain they flew;
<A NAME="664"></A><BR>And now the flashing-footed Argive steed
<A NAME="665"></A><BR>By Sthenelus bestridden, had won the race,
<A NAME="666"></A><BR>But from the course he swerved, and o'er the plain
<A NAME="667"></A><BR>Once and again rushed wide; nor Capaneus' son,
<A NAME="668"></A><BR>Good horseman though he were, could turn him back
<A NAME="669"></A><BR>By rein or whip, because that steed was strange
<A NAME="670"></A><BR>Still to the race-course; yet of lineage
<A NAME="671"></A><BR>Noble was he, for in his veins the blood
<A NAME="672"></A><BR>Of swift Arion ran, the foal begotten
<A NAME="673"></A><BR>By the loud-piping West-wind on a Harpy,
<A NAME="674"></A><BR>The fleetest of all earth-born steeds, whose feet
<A NAME="675"></A><BR>Could race against his father's swiftest blasts.
<A NAME="676"></A><BR>Him did the Blessed to Adrastus give:
<A NAME="677"></A><BR>And from him sprang the steed of Sthenelus,
<A NAME="678"></A><BR>Which Tydeus' son had given unto his friend
<A NAME="679"></A><BR>In hallowed Troyland.  Filled with confidence
<A NAME="680"></A><BR>In those swift feet his rider led him forth
<A NAME="681"></A><BR>Unto the contest of the steeds that day,
<A NAME="682"></A><BR>Looking his horsemanship should surely win
<A NAME="683"></A><BR>Renown: yet victory gladdened not his heart
<A NAME="684"></A><BR>In that great struggle for Achilles' prizes;
<A NAME="685"></A><BR>Nay, swift albeit he was, the King of Men
<A NAME="686"></A><BR>By skill outraced him.  Shouted all the folk,
<A NAME="687"></A><BR>"Glory to Agamemnon!"  Yet they acclaimed
<A NAME="688"></A><BR>The steed of valiant Sthenelus and his lord,
<A NAME="689"></A><BR>For that the fiery flying of his feet
<A NAME="690"></A><BR>Still won him second place, albeit oft
<A NAME="691"></A><BR>Wide of the course he swerved.  Then Thetis gave
<A NAME="692"></A><BR>To Atreus' son, while laughed his lips for joy,
<A NAME="693"></A><BR>God-sprung Polydorus' breastplate silver-wrought.
<A NAME="694"></A><BR>To Sthenelus Asteropaeus' massy helm,
<A NAME="695"></A><BR>Two lances, and a taslet strong, she gave.
<A NAME="696"></A><BR>Yea, and to all the riders who that day
<A NAME="697"></A><BR>Came at Achilles' funeral-feast to strive
<A NAME="698"></A><BR>She gave gifts.  But the son of the old war-lord,
<A NAME="699"></A><BR>Laertes, inly grieved to be withheld
<A NAME="700"></A><BR>From contests of the strong, how fain soe'er,
<A NAME="701"></A><BR>By that sore wound which Alcon dealt to him
<A NAME="702"></A><BR>In the grim fight around dead Aeacas' son.
