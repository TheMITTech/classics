<A NAME="10"></A><B>How Troy in the Night Was Taken and Sacked With Fire and 
<A NAME="11"></A>Slaughter</B>
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="12"></A>So feasted they through Troy, and in their midst
<A NAME="13"></A><BR>Loud pealed the flutes and pipes: on every hand
<A NAME="14"></A><BR>Were song and dance, laughter and cries confused
<A NAME="15"></A><BR>Of banqueters beside the meats and wine.
<A NAME="16"></A><BR>They, lifting in their hands the beakers brimmed,
<A NAME="17"></A><BR>Recklessly drank, till heavy of brain they grew,
<A NAME="18"></A><BR>Till rolled their fluctuant eyes.  Now and again
<A NAME="19"></A><BR>Some mouth would babble the drunkard's broken words.
<A NAME="20"></A><BR>The household gear, the very roof and walls
<A NAME="21"></A><BR>Seemed as they rocked: all things they looked on 
<A NAME="22"></A>seemed
<A NAME="23"></A><BR>Whirled in wild dance.  About their eyes a veil
<A NAME="24"></A><BR>Of mist dropped, for the drunkard's sight is dimmed,
<A NAME="25"></A><BR>And the wit dulled, when rise the fumes to the brain:
<A NAME="26"></A><BR>And thus a heavy-headed feaster cried:
<A NAME="27"></A><BR>"For naught the Danaans mustered that great host
<A NAME="28"></A><BR>Hither!  Fools, they have wrought not their intent,
<A NAME="29"></A><BR>But with hopes unaccomplished from our town
<A NAME="30"></A><BR>Like silly boys or women have they fled."
<A NAME="31"></A><BR><BR>So cried a Trojan wit-befogged with wine,
<A NAME="32"></A><BR>Fool, nor discerned destruction at the doors.
<A NAME="33"></A><BR><BR>When sleep had locked his fetters everywhere
<A NAME="34"></A><BR>Through Troy on folk fulfilled of wine and meat,
<A NAME="35"></A><BR>Then Sinon lifted high a blazing torch
<A NAME="36"></A><BR>To show the Argive men the splendour of fire.
<A NAME="37"></A><BR>But fearfully the while his heart beat, lest
<A NAME="38"></A><BR>The men of Troy might see it, and the plot
<A NAME="39"></A><BR>Be suddenly revealed.  But on their beds
<A NAME="40"></A><BR>Sleeping their last sleep lay they, heavy with wine.
<A NAME="41"></A><BR>The host saw, and from Tenedos set sail.
<A NAME="42"></A><BR><BR>Then nigh the Horse drew Sinon: softly he called,
<A NAME="43"></A><BR>Full softly, that no man of Troy might hear,
<A NAME="44"></A><BR>But only Achaea's chiefs, far from whose eyes
<A NAME="45"></A><BR>Sleep hovered, so athirst were they for fight.
<A NAME="46"></A><BR>They heard, and to Odysseus all inclined
<A NAME="47"></A><BR>Their ears: he bade them urgently go forth
<A NAME="48"></A><BR>Softly and fearlessly; and they obeyed
<A NAME="49"></A><BR>That battle-summons, pressing in hot haste
<A NAME="50"></A><BR>To leap to earth: but in his subtlety
<A NAME="51"></A><BR>He stayed them from all thrusting eagerly forth.
<A NAME="52"></A><BR>But first himself with swift unfaltering hands,
<A NAME="53"></A><BR>Helped of Epeius, here and there unbarred
<A NAME="54"></A><BR>The ribs of the Horse of beams: above the planks
<A NAME="55"></A><BR>A little he raised his head, and gazed around
<A NAME="56"></A><BR>On all sides, if he haply might descry
<A NAME="57"></A><BR>One Trojan waking yet.  As when a wolf,
<A NAME="58"></A><BR>With hunger stung to the heart, comes from the hills,
<A NAME="59"></A><BR>And ravenous for flesh draws nigh the flock
<A NAME="60"></A><BR>Penned in the wide fold, slinking past the men
<A NAME="61"></A><BR>And dogs that watch, all keen to ward the sheep,
<A NAME="62"></A><BR>Then o'er the fold-wall leaps with soundless feet;
<A NAME="63"></A><BR>So stole Odysseus down from the Horse: with him
<A NAME="64"></A><BR>Followed the war-fain lords of Hellas' League,
<A NAME="65"></A><BR>Orderly stepping down the ladders, which
<A NAME="66"></A><BR>Epeius framed for paths of mighty men,
<A NAME="67"></A><BR>For entering and for passing forth the Horse,
<A NAME="68"></A><BR>Who down them now on this side, that side, streamed
<A NAME="69"></A><BR>As fearless wasps startled by stroke of axe
<A NAME="70"></A><BR>In angry mood pour all together forth
<A NAME="71"></A><BR>From the tree-bole, at sound of woodman's blow;
<A NAME="72"></A><BR>So battle-kindled forth the Horse they poured
<A NAME="73"></A><BR>Into the midst of that strong city of Troy
<A NAME="74"></A><BR>With hearts that leapt expectant.  [With swift hands
<A NAME="75"></A><BR>Snatched they the brands from dying hearths, and 
<A NAME="76"></A>fired
<A NAME="77"></A><BR>Temple and palace.  Onward then to the gates
<A NAME="78"></A><BR>Sped they,] and swiftly slew the slumbering guards,
<A NAME="79"></A><BR>[Then held the gate-towers till their friends should 
<A NAME="80"></A>come.]
<A NAME="81"></A><BR>Fast rowed the host the while; on swept the ships
<A NAME="82"></A><BR>Over the great flood: Thetis made their paths
<A NAME="83"></A><BR>Straight, and behind them sent a driving wind
<A NAME="84"></A><BR>Speeding them, and the hearts Achaean glowed.
<A NAME="85"></A><BR>Swiftly to Hellespont's shore they came, and there
<A NAME="86"></A><BR>Beached they the keels again, and deftly dealt
<A NAME="87"></A><BR>With whatso tackling appertains to ships.
<A NAME="88"></A><BR>Then leapt they aland, and hasted on to Troy
<A NAME="89"></A><BR>Silent as sheep that hurry to the fold
<A NAME="90"></A><BR>From woodland pasture on an autumn eve;
<A NAME="91"></A><BR>So without sound of voices marched they on
<A NAME="92"></A><BR>Unto the Trojans' fortress, eager all
<A NAME="93"></A><BR>To help those mighty chiefs with foes begirt.
<A NAME="94"></A><BR>Now these -- as famished wolves fierce-glaring round
<A NAME="95"></A><BR>Fall on a fold mid the long forest-hills,
<A NAME="96"></A><BR>While sleeps the toil-worn watchman, and they rend
<A NAME="97"></A><BR>The sheep on every hand within the wall
<A NAME="98"></A><BR>In darkness, and all round [are heaped the slain;
<A NAME="99"></A><BR>So these within the city smote and slew,
<A NAME="100"></A><BR>As swarmed the awakened foe around them; yet,
<A NAME="101"></A><BR>Fast as they slew, aye faster closed on them
<A NAME="102"></A><BR>Those thousands, mad to thrust them from the gates.]
<A NAME="103"></A><BR>Slipping in blood and stumbling o'er the dead
<A NAME="104"></A><BR>[Their line reeled,] and destruction loomed o'er 
<A NAME="105"></A>them,
<A NAME="106"></A><BR>Though Danaan thousands near and nearer drew.
<A NAME="107"></A><BR><BR>But when the whole host reached the walls of 
<A NAME="108"></A>Troy,
<A NAME="109"></A><BR>Into the city of Priam, breathing rage
<A NAME="110"></A><BR>Of fight, with reckless battle-lust they poured;
<A NAME="111"></A><BR>And all that fortress found they full of war
<A NAME="112"></A><BR>And slaughter, palaces, temples, horribly
<A NAME="113"></A><BR>Blazing on all sides; glowed their hearts with joy.
<A NAME="114"></A><BR>In deadly mood then charged they on the foe.
<A NAME="115"></A><BR>Ares and fell Enyo maddened there:
<A NAME="116"></A><BR>Blood ran in torrents, drenched was all the earth,
<A NAME="117"></A><BR>As Trojans and their alien helpers died.
<A NAME="118"></A><BR>Here were men lying quelled by bitter death
<A NAME="119"></A><BR>All up and down the city in their blood;
<A NAME="120"></A><BR>Others on them were falling, gasping forth
<A NAME="121"></A><BR>Their life's strength; others, clutching in their 
<A NAME="122"></A>hands
<A NAME="123"></A><BR>Their bowels that looked through hideous gashes 
<A NAME="124"></A>forth,
<A NAME="125"></A><BR>Wandered in wretched plight around their homes:
<A NAME="126"></A><BR>Others, whose feet, while yet asleep they lay,
<A NAME="127"></A><BR>Had been hewn off, with groans unutterable
<A NAME="128"></A><BR>Crawled mid the corpses.  Some, who had rushed to 
<A NAME="129"></A>fight,
<A NAME="130"></A><BR>Lay now in dust, with hands and heads hewn off.
<A NAME="131"></A><BR>Some were there, through whose backs, even as they 
<A NAME="132"></A>fled,
<A NAME="133"></A><BR>The spear had passed, clear through to the breast, and 
<A NAME="134"></A>some
<A NAME="135"></A><BR>Whose waists the lance had pierced, impaling them
<A NAME="136"></A><BR>Where sharpest stings the anguish-laden steel.
<A NAME="137"></A><BR>And all about the city dolorous howls
<A NAME="138"></A><BR>Of dogs uprose, and miserable moans
<A NAME="139"></A><BR>Of strong men stricken to death; and every home
<A NAME="140"></A><BR>With awful cries was echoing.  Rang the shrieks
<A NAME="141"></A><BR>Of women, like to screams of cranes, which see
<A NAME="142"></A><BR>An eagle stooping on them from the sky,
<A NAME="143"></A><BR>Which have no courage to resist, but scream
<A NAME="144"></A><BR>Long terror-shrieks in dread of Zeus's bird;
<A NAME="145"></A><BR>So here, so there the Trojan women wailed,
<A NAME="146"></A><BR>Some starting from their sleep, some to the ground
<A NAME="147"></A><BR>Leaping: they thought not in that agony
<A NAME="148"></A><BR>Of robe and zone; in naught but tunics clad
<A NAME="149"></A><BR>Distraught they wandered: others found nor veil
<A NAME="150"></A><BR>Nor cloak to cast about them, but, as came
<A NAME="151"></A><BR>Onward their foes, they stood with beating hearts
<A NAME="152"></A><BR>Trembling, as lettered by despair, essaying,
<A NAME="153"></A><BR>All-hapless, with their hands alone to hide
<A NAME="154"></A><BR>Their nakedness.  And some in frenzy of woe:
<A NAME="155"></A><BR>Their tresses tore, and beat their breasts, and 
<A NAME="156"></A>screamed.
<A NAME="157"></A><BR>Others against that stormy torrent of foes
<A NAME="158"></A><BR>Recklessly rushed, insensible of fear,
<A NAME="159"></A><BR>Through mad desire to aid the perishing,
<A NAME="160"></A><BR>Husbands or children; for despair had given
<A NAME="161"></A><BR>High courage.  Shrieks had startled from their sleep
<A NAME="162"></A><BR>Soft little babes whose hearts had never known
<A NAME="163"></A><BR>Trouble -- and there one with another lay
<A NAME="164"></A><BR>Gasping their lives out!  Some there were whose 
<A NAME="165"></A>dreams
<A NAME="166"></A><BR>Changed to a sudden vision of doom.  All round
<A NAME="167"></A><BR>The fell Fates gloated horribly o'er the slain.
<A NAME="168"></A><BR>And even as swine be slaughtered in the court
<A NAME="169"></A><BR>Of a rich king who makes his folk a feast,
<A NAME="170"></A><BR>So without number were they slain.  The wine
<A NAME="171"></A><BR>Left in the mixing-bowls was blent with blood
<A NAME="172"></A><BR>Gruesomely.  No man bare a sword unstained
<A NAME="173"></A><BR>With murder of defenceless folk of Troy,
<A NAME="174"></A><BR>Though he were but a weakling in fair fight.
<A NAME="175"></A><BR>And as by wolves or jackals sheep are torn,
<A NAME="176"></A><BR>What time the furnace-breath of midnoon-heat
<A NAME="177"></A><BR>Darts down, and all the flock beneath the shade
<A NAME="178"></A><BR>Are crowded, and the shepherd is not there,
<A NAME="179"></A><BR>But to the homestead bears afar their milk;
<A NAME="180"></A><BR>And the fierce brutes leap on them, tear their throats,
<A NAME="181"></A><BR>Gorge to the full their ravenous maws, and then
<A NAME="182"></A><BR>Lap the dark blood, and linger still to slay
<A NAME="183"></A><BR>All in mere lust of slaughter, and provide
<A NAME="184"></A><BR>An evil banquet for that shepherd-lord;
<A NAME="185"></A><BR>So through the city of Priam Danaans slew
<A NAME="186"></A><BR>One after other in that last fight of all.
<A NAME="187"></A><BR>No Trojan there was woundless, all men's limbs
<A NAME="188"></A><BR>With blood in torrents spilt were darkly dashed.
<A NAME="189"></A><BR><BR>Nor seetheless were the Danaans in the fray:
<A NAME="190"></A><BR>With beakers some were smitten, with tables some,
<A NAME="191"></A><BR>Thrust in the eyes of some were burning brands
<A NAME="192"></A><BR>Snatched from the hearth; some died transfixed with 
<A NAME="193"></A>spits
<A NAME="194"></A><BR>Yet left within the hot flesh of the swine
<A NAME="195"></A><BR>Whereon the red breath of the Fire-god beat;
<A NAME="196"></A><BR>Others struck down by bills and axes keen
<A NAME="197"></A><BR>Gasped in their blood: from some men's hands were 
<A NAME="198"></A>shorn
<A NAME="199"></A><BR>The fingers, who, in wild hope to escape
<A NAME="200"></A><BR>The imminent death, had clutched the blades of swords.
<A NAME="201"></A><BR>And here in that dark tumult one had hurled
<A NAME="202"></A><BR>A stone, and crushed the crown of a friend's head.
<A NAME="203"></A><BR>Like wild beasts trapped and stabbed within a fold
<A NAME="204"></A><BR>On a lone steading, frenziedly they fought,
<A NAME="205"></A><BR>Mad with despair-enkindled rage, beneath
<A NAME="206"></A><BR>That night of horror.  Hot with battle-lust
<A NAME="207"></A><BR>Here, there, the fighters rushed and hurried through
<A NAME="208"></A><BR>The palace of Priam.  Many an Argive fell
<A NAME="209"></A><BR>Spear-slain; for whatso Trojan in his halls
<A NAME="210"></A><BR>Might seize a sword, might lift a spear in hand,
<A NAME="211"></A><BR>Slew foes -- ay, heavy though he were with wine.
<A NAME="212"></A><BR><BR>Upflashed a glare unearthly through the town,
<A NAME="213"></A><BR>For many an Argive bare in hand a torch
<A NAME="214"></A><BR>To know in that dim battle friends from foes.
<A NAME="215"></A><BR><BR>Then Tydeus' son amid the war-storm met
<A NAME="216"></A><BR>Spearman Coroebus, lordly Mygdon's son,
<A NAME="217"></A><BR>And 'neath the left ribs pierced him with the lance
<A NAME="218"></A><BR>Where run the life-ways of man's meat and drink;
<A NAME="219"></A><BR>So met him black death borne upon the spear:
<A NAME="220"></A><BR>Down in dark blood he fell mid hosts of slain.
<A NAME="221"></A><BR>Ah fool!  the bride he won not, Priam's child
<A NAME="222"></A><BR>Cassandra, yea, his loveliest, for whose sake
<A NAME="223"></A><BR>To Priam's burg but yesterday he came,
<A NAME="224"></A><BR>And vaunted he would thrust the Argives back
<A NAME="225"></A><BR>From Ilium.  Never did the Gods fulfil
<A NAME="226"></A><BR>His hope: the Fates hurled doom upon his head.
<A NAME="227"></A><BR>With him the slayer laid Eurydamas low,
<A NAME="228"></A><BR>Antenor's gallant son-in-law, who most
<A NAME="229"></A><BR>For prudence was pre-eminent in Troy.
<A NAME="230"></A><BR>Then met he Ilioneus the elder of days,
<A NAME="231"></A><BR>And flashed his terrible sword forth.  All the limbs
<A NAME="232"></A><BR>Of that grey sire were palsied with his fear:
<A NAME="233"></A><BR>He put forth trembling hands, with one he caught
<A NAME="234"></A><BR>The swift avenging sword, with one he clasped
<A NAME="235"></A><BR>The hero's knees.  Despite his fury of war,
<A NAME="236"></A><BR>A moment paused his wrath, or haply a God
<A NAME="237"></A><BR>Held back the sword a space, that that old man
<A NAME="238"></A><BR>Might speak to his fierce foe one word of prayer.
<A NAME="239"></A><BR>Piteously cried he, terror-overwhelmed:
<A NAME="240"></A><BR>"I kneel before thee, whosoe'er thou be
<A NAME="241"></A><BR>Of mighty Argives.  Oh compassionate
<A NAME="242"></A><BR>My suppliant hands!  Abate thy wrath!  To slay
<A NAME="243"></A><BR>The young and valiant is a glorious thing;
<A NAME="244"></A><BR>But if thou smite an old man, small renown
<A NAME="245"></A><BR>Waits on thy prowess.  Therefore turn from me
<A NAME="246"></A><BR>Thine hands against young men, if thou dost hope
<A NAME="247"></A><BR>Ever to come to grey hairs such as mine."
<A NAME="248"></A><BR><BR>So spake he; but replied strong Tydeus' son:
<A NAME="249"></A><BR>"Old man, I look to attain to honoured age;
<A NAME="250"></A><BR>But while my Strength yet waxeth, will not I
<A NAME="251"></A><BR>Spare any foe, but hurl to Hades all.
<A NAME="252"></A><BR>The brave man makes an end of every foe."
<A NAME="253"></A><BR><BR>Then through his throat that terrible warrior 
<A NAME="254"></A>drave
<A NAME="255"></A><BR>The deadly blade, and thrust it straight to where
<A NAME="256"></A><BR>The paths of man's life lead by swiftest way
<A NAME="257"></A><BR>Blood-paved to doom: death palsied his poor strength
<A NAME="258"></A><BR>By Diomedes' hands.  Thence rushed he on
<A NAME="259"></A><BR>Slaying the Trojans, storming in his might
<A NAME="260"></A><BR>All through their fortress: pierced by his long 
<A NAME="261"></A>spear
<A NAME="262"></A><BR>Eurycoon fell, Perimnestor's son renowned.
<A NAME="263"></A><BR>Amphimedon Aias slew: Agamemnon smote
<A NAME="264"></A><BR>Damastor's son: Idomeneus struck down
<A NAME="265"></A><BR>Mimas: by Meges Deiopites died.
<A NAME="266"></A><BR><BR>Achilles' son with his resistless lance
<A NAME="267"></A><BR>Smote godlike Pammon; then his javelin pierced
<A NAME="268"></A><BR>Polites in mid-rush: Antiphonus
<A NAME="269"></A><BR>Dead upon these he laid, all Priam's sons.
<A NAME="270"></A><BR>Agenor faced him in the fight, and fell:
<A NAME="271"></A><BR>Hero on hero slew he; everywhere
<A NAME="272"></A><BR>Stalked at his side Death's black doom manifest:
<A NAME="273"></A><BR>Clad in his sire's might, whomso he met he slew.
<A NAME="274"></A><BR>Last, on Troy's king in murderous mood he came.
<A NAME="275"></A><BR>By Zeus the Hearth-lord's altar.  Seeing him,
<A NAME="276"></A><BR>Old Priam knew him and quaked not; for he longed
<A NAME="277"></A><BR>Himself to lay his life down midst his sons;
<A NAME="278"></A><BR>And craving death to Achilles' seed he spake:
<A NAME="279"></A><BR>"Fierce-hearted son of Achilles strong in war,
<A NAME="280"></A><BR>Slay me, and pity not my misery.
<A NAME="281"></A><BR>I have no will to see the sun's light more,
<A NAME="282"></A><BR>Who have suffered woes so many and so dread.
<A NAME="283"></A><BR>With my sons would I die, and so forget
<A NAME="284"></A><BR>Anguish and horror of war.  Oh that thy sire
<A NAME="285"></A><BR>Had slain me, ere mine eyes beheld aflame
<A NAME="286"></A><BR>Illium, had slain me when I brought to him
<A NAME="287"></A><BR>Ransom for Hector, whom thy father slew.
<A NAME="288"></A><BR>He spared me -- so the Fates had spun my thread
<A NAME="289"></A><BR>Of destiny.  But thou, glut with my blood
<A NAME="290"></A><BR>Thy fierce heart, and let me forget my pain."
<A NAME="291"></A><BR>Answered Achilles' battle-eager son:
<A NAME="292"></A><BR>"Fain am I, yea, in haste to grant thy prayer.
<A NAME="293"></A><BR>A foe like thee will I not leave alive;
<A NAME="294"></A><BR>For naught is dearer unto men than life."
<A NAME="295"></A><BR><BR>With one stroke swept he off that hoary head
<A NAME="296"></A><BR>Lightly as when a reaper lops an ear
<A NAME="297"></A><BR>In a parched cornfield at the harvest-tide.
<A NAME="298"></A><BR>With lips yet murmuring low it rolled afar
<A NAME="299"></A><BR>From where with quivering limbs the body lay
<A NAME="300"></A><BR>Amidst dark-purple blood and slaughtered men.
<A NAME="301"></A><BR>So lay he, chiefest once of all the world
<A NAME="302"></A><BR>In lineage, wealth, in many and goodly sons.
<A NAME="303"></A><BR>Ah me, not long abides the honour of man,
<A NAME="304"></A><BR>But shame from unseen ambush leaps on him
<A NAME="305"></A><BR>So clutched him Doom, so he forgat his woes.
<A NAME="306"></A><BR><BR>Yea, also did those Danaan car-lords hurl
<A NAME="307"></A><BR>From a high tower the babe Astyanax,
<A NAME="308"></A><BR>Dashing him out of life.  They tore the child
<A NAME="309"></A><BR>Out of his mother's arms, in wrathful hate
<A NAME="310"></A><BR>Of Hector, who in life had dealt to them
<A NAME="311"></A><BR>Such havoc; therefore hated they his seed,
<A NAME="312"></A><BR>And down from that high rampart flung his child 
<A NAME="313"></A>--
<A NAME="314"></A><BR>A wordless babe that nothing knew of war!
<A NAME="315"></A><BR>As when amid the mountains hungry wolves
<A NAME="316"></A><BR>Chase from the mother's side a suckling calf,
<A NAME="317"></A><BR>And with malignant cunning drive it o'er
<A NAME="318"></A><BR>An echoing cliffs edge, while runs to and fro
<A NAME="319"></A><BR>Its dam with long moans mourning her dear child,
<A NAME="320"></A><BR>And a new evil followeth hard on her,
<A NAME="321"></A><BR>For suddenly lions seize her for a prey;
<A NAME="322"></A><BR>So, as she agonized for her son, the foe
<A NAME="323"></A><BR>To bondage haled with other captive thralls
<A NAME="324"></A><BR>That shrieking daughter of King Eetion.
<A NAME="325"></A><BR>Then, as on those three fearful deaths she thought
<A NAME="326"></A><BR>Of husband, child, and father, Andromaehe
<A NAME="327"></A><BR>Longed sore to die.  Yea, for the royally-born
<A NAME="328"></A><BR>Better it is to die in war, than do
<A NAME="329"></A><BR>The service of the thrall to baser folk.
<A NAME="330"></A><BR>All piteously the broken-hearted cried:
<A NAME="331"></A><BR>"Oh hurl my body also from the wall,
<A NAME="332"></A><BR>Or down the cliff, or cast me midst the fire,
<A NAME="333"></A><BR>Ye Argives!  Woes are mine unutterable!
<A NAME="334"></A><BR>For Peleus' son smote down my noble father
<A NAME="335"></A><BR>In Thebe, and in Troy mine husband slew,
<A NAME="336"></A><BR>Who unto me was all mine heart's desire,
<A NAME="337"></A><BR>Who left me in mine halls one little child,
<A NAME="338"></A><BR>My darling and my pride -- of all mine hopes
<A NAME="339"></A><BR>In him fell merciless Fate hath cheated me!
<A NAME="340"></A><BR>Oh therefore thrust this broken-hearted one
<A NAME="341"></A><BR>Now out of life!  Hale me not overseas
<A NAME="342"></A><BR>Mingled with spear-thralls; for my soul henceforth
<A NAME="343"></A><BR>Hath no more pleasure in life, since God hath slain
<A NAME="344"></A><BR>My nearest and my dearest!  For me waits
<A NAME="345"></A><BR>Trouble and anguish and lone homelessness!"
<A NAME="346"></A><BR><BR>So cried she, longing for the grave; for vile
<A NAME="347"></A><BR>Is life to them whose glory is swallowed up
<A NAME="348"></A><BR>Of shame: a horror is the scorn of men.
<A NAME="349"></A><BR>But, spite her prayers, to thraldom dragged they 
<A NAME="350"></A>her.
<A NAME="351"></A><BR><BR>In all the homes of Troy lay dying men,
<A NAME="352"></A><BR>And rose from all a lamentable cry,
<A NAME="353"></A><BR>Save only Antenor's halls; for unto him
<A NAME="354"></A><BR>The Argives rendered hospitality's debt,
<A NAME="355"></A><BR>For that in time past had his roof received
<A NAME="356"></A><BR>And sheltered godlike Menelaus, when
<A NAME="357"></A><BR>He with Odysseus came to claim his own.
<A NAME="358"></A><BR>Therefore the mighty sons of Achaea showed
<A NAME="359"></A><BR>Grace to him, as to a friend, and spared his life
<A NAME="360"></A><BR>And substance, fearing Themis who seeth all.
<A NAME="361"></A><BR><BR>Then also princely Anchises' noble son --
<A NAME="362"></A><BR>Hard had he fought through Priam's burg that night
<A NAME="363"></A><BR>With spear and valour, and many had he slain --
<A NAME="364"></A><BR>When now he saw the city set aflame
<A NAME="365"></A><BR>By hands of foes, saw her folk perishing
<A NAME="366"></A><BR>In multitudes, her treasures spoiled, her wives
<A NAME="367"></A><BR>And children dragged to thraldom from their homes,
<A NAME="368"></A><BR>No more he hoped to see the stately walls
<A NAME="369"></A><BR>Of his birth-city, but bethought him now
<A NAME="370"></A><BR>How from that mighty ruin to escape.
<A NAME="371"></A><BR>And as the helmsman of a ship, who toils
<A NAME="372"></A><BR>On the deep sea, and matches all his craft
<A NAME="373"></A><BR>Against the winds and waves from every side
<A NAME="374"></A><BR>Rushing against him in the stormy time,
<A NAME="375"></A><BR>Forspent at last, both hand and heart, when now
<A NAME="376"></A><BR>The ship is foundering in the surge, forsakes
<A NAME="377"></A><BR>The helm, to launch forth in a little boat,
<A NAME="378"></A><BR>And heeds no longer ship and lading; so
<A NAME="379"></A><BR>Anchises' gallant son forsook the town
<A NAME="380"></A><BR>And left her to her foes, a sea of fire.
<A NAME="381"></A><BR>His son and father alone he snatched from death;
<A NAME="382"></A><BR>The old man broken down with years he set
<A NAME="383"></A><BR>On his broad shoulders with his own strong hands,
<A NAME="384"></A><BR>And led the young child by his small soft hand,
<A NAME="385"></A><BR>Whose little footsteps lightly touched the ground;
<A NAME="386"></A><BR>And, as he quaked to see that work of deaths
<A NAME="387"></A><BR>His father led him through the roar of fight,
<A NAME="388"></A><BR>And clinging hung on him the tender child,
<A NAME="389"></A><BR>Tears down his soft cheeks streaming.  But the man
<A NAME="390"></A><BR>O'er many a body sprang with hurrying feet,
<A NAME="391"></A><BR>And in the darkness in his own despite
<A NAME="392"></A><BR>Trampled on many.  Cypris guided them,
<A NAME="393"></A><BR>Earnest to save from that wild ruin her son,
<A NAME="394"></A><BR>His father, and his child.  As on he pressed,
<A NAME="395"></A><BR>The flames gave back before him everywhere:
<A NAME="396"></A><BR>The blast of the Fire-god's breath to right and 
<A NAME="397"></A>left
<A NAME="398"></A><BR>Was cloven asunder.  Spears and javelins hurled
<A NAME="399"></A><BR>Against him by the Achaeans harmless fell.
<A NAME="400"></A><BR>Also, to stay them, Calchas cried aloud:
<A NAME="401"></A><BR>"Forbear against Aeneas' noble head
<A NAME="402"></A><BR>To hurl the bitter dart, the deadly spear!
<A NAME="403"></A><BR>Fated he is by the high Gods' decree
<A NAME="404"></A><BR>To pass from Xanthus, and by Tiber's flood
<A NAME="405"></A><BR>To found a city holy and glorious
<A NAME="406"></A><BR>Through all time, and to rule o'er tribes of men
<A NAME="407"></A><BR>Far-sundered.  Of his seed shall lords of earth
<A NAME="408"></A><BR>Rule from the rising to the setting sun.
<A NAME="409"></A><BR>Yea, with the Immortals ever shall he dwell,
<A NAME="410"></A><BR>Who is son of Aphrodite lovely-tressed.
<A NAME="411"></A><BR>From him too is it meet we hold our hands
<A NAME="412"></A><BR>Because he hath preferred his father and son
<A NAME="413"></A><BR>To gold, to all things that might profit a man
<A NAME="414"></A><BR>Who fleeth exiled to an alien land.
<A NAME="415"></A><BR>This one night hath revealed to us a man
<A NAME="416"></A><BR>Faithful to death to his father and his child."
<A NAME="417"></A><BR><BR>Then hearkened they, and as a God did all
<A NAME="418"></A><BR>Look on him.  Forth the city hasted he
<A NAME="419"></A><BR>Whither his feet should bear him, while the foe
<A NAME="420"></A><BR>Made havoc still of goodly-builded Troy.
<A NAME="421"></A><BR><BR>Then also Menelaus in Helen's bower
<A NAME="422"></A><BR>Found, heavy with wine, ill-starred Deiphobus,
<A NAME="423"></A><BR>And slew him with the sword: but she had fled
<A NAME="424"></A><BR>And hidden her in the palace.  O'er the blood
<A NAME="425"></A><BR>Of that slain man exulted he, and cried:
<A NAME="426"></A><BR>"Dog!  I, even I have dealt thee unwelcome death
<A NAME="427"></A><BR>This day!  No dawn divine shall meet thee again
<A NAME="428"></A><BR>Alive in Troy -- ay, though thou vaunt thyself
<A NAME="429"></A><BR>Spouse of the child of Zeus the thunder-voiced!
<A NAME="430"></A><BR>Black death hath trapped thee slain in my wife's 
<A NAME="431"></A>bower!
<A NAME="432"></A><BR>Would I had met Alexander too in fight
<A NAME="433"></A><BR>Ere this, and plucked his heart out!  So my grief
<A NAME="434"></A><BR>Had been a lighter load.  But he hath paid
<A NAME="435"></A><BR>Already justice' debt, hath passed beneath
<A NAME="436"></A><BR>Death's cold dark shadow.  Ha, small joy to thee
<A NAME="437"></A><BR>My wife was doomed to bring!  Ay, wicked men
<A NAME="438"></A><BR>Never elude pure Themis: night and day
<A NAME="439"></A><BR>Her eyes are on them, and the wide world through
<A NAME="440"></A><BR>Above the tribes of men she floats in air,
<A NAME="441"></A><BR>Holpen of Zeus, for punishment of sin."
<A NAME="442"></A><BR><BR>On passed he, dealing merciless death to foes,
<A NAME="443"></A><BR>For maddened was his soul with jealousy.
<A NAME="444"></A><BR>Against the Trojans was his bold heart full
<A NAME="445"></A><BR>Of thoughts of vengeance, which were now fulfilled
<A NAME="446"></A><BR>By the dread Goddess Justice, for that theirs
<A NAME="447"></A><BR>Was that first outrage touching Helen, theirs
<A NAME="448"></A><BR>That profanation of the oaths, and theirs
<A NAME="449"></A><BR>That trampling on the blood of sacrifice
<A NAME="450"></A><BR>When their presumptuous souls forgat the Gods.
<A NAME="451"></A><BR>Therefore the Vengeance-friends brought woes on 
<A NAME="452"></A>them
<A NAME="453"></A><BR>Thereafter, and some died in fighting field,
<A NAME="454"></A><BR>Some now in Troy by board and bridal bower.
<A NAME="455"></A><BR><BR>Menelaus mid the inner chambers found
<A NAME="456"></A><BR>At last his wife, there cowering from the wrath
<A NAME="457"></A><BR>Of her bold-hearted lord.  He glared on her,
<A NAME="458"></A><BR>Hungering to slay her in his jealous rage.
<A NAME="459"></A><BR>But winsome Aphrodite curbed him, struck
<A NAME="460"></A><BR>Out of his hand the sword, his onrush reined,
<A NAME="461"></A><BR>Jealousy's dark cloud swept she away, and stirred
<A NAME="462"></A><BR>Love's deep sweet well-springs in his heart and 
<A NAME="463"></A>eyes.
<A NAME="464"></A><BR>Swept o'er him strange amazement: powerless all
<A NAME="465"></A><BR>Was he to lift the sword against her neck,
<A NAME="466"></A><BR>Seeing her splendour of beauty.  Like a stock
<A NAME="467"></A><BR>Of dead wood in a mountain forest, which
<A NAME="468"></A><BR>No swiftly-rushing blasts of north-winds shake,
<A NAME="469"></A><BR>Nor fury of south-winds ever, so he stood,
<A NAME="470"></A><BR>So dazed abode long time.  All his great strength
<A NAME="471"></A><BR>Was broken, as he looked upon his wife.
<A NAME="472"></A><BR>And suddenly had he forgotten all
<A NAME="473"></A><BR>Yea, all her sins against her spousal-troth;
<A NAME="474"></A><BR>For Aphrodite made all fade away,
<A NAME="475"></A><BR>She who subdueth all immortal hearts
<A NAME="476"></A><BR>And mortal.  Yet even so he lifted up
<A NAME="477"></A><BR>From earth his sword, and made as he would rush
<A NAME="478"></A><BR>Upon his wife but other was his intent,
<A NAME="479"></A><BR>Even as he sprang: he did but feign, to cheat
<A NAME="480"></A><BR>Achaean eyes.  Then did his brother stay
<A NAME="481"></A><BR>His fury, and spake with pacifying words,
<A NAME="482"></A><BR>Fearing lest all they had toiled for should be lost:
<A NAME="483"></A><BR>"Forbear wrath, Menelaus, now: 'twere shame
<A NAME="484"></A><BR>To slay thy wedded wife, for whose sake we
<A NAME="485"></A><BR>Have suffered much affliction, while we sought
<A NAME="486"></A><BR>Vengeance on Priam.  Not, as thou dost deem,
<A NAME="487"></A><BR>Was Helen's the sin, but his who set at naught
<A NAME="488"></A><BR>The Guest-lord, and thine hospitable board;
<A NAME="489"></A><BR>So with death-pangs hath God requited him."
<A NAME="490"></A><BR><BR>Then hearkened Menelaus to his rede.
<A NAME="491"></A><BR>But the Gods, palled in dark clouds, mourned for 
<A NAME="492"></A>Troy,
<A NAME="493"></A><BR>A ruined glory save fair-tressed Tritonis
<A NAME="494"></A><BR>And Hera: their hearts triumphed, when they saw
<A NAME="495"></A><BR>The burg of god-descended Priam destroyed.
<A NAME="496"></A><BR>Yet not the wise heart Trito-born herself
<A NAME="497"></A><BR>Was wholly tearless; for within her fane
<A NAME="498"></A><BR>Outraged Cassandra was of Oileus son
<A NAME="499"></A><BR>Lust-maddened.  But grim vengeance upon him
<A NAME="500"></A><BR>Ere long the Goddess wreaked, repaying insult
<A NAME="501"></A><BR>With mortal sufferance.  Yea, she would not look
<A NAME="502"></A><BR>Upon the infamy, but clad herself
<A NAME="503"></A><BR>With shame and wrath as with a cloak: she turned
<A NAME="504"></A><BR>Her stern eyes to the temple-roof, and groaned
<A NAME="505"></A><BR>The holy image, and the hallowed floor
<A NAME="506"></A><BR>Quaked mightily.  Yet did he not forbear
<A NAME="507"></A><BR>His mad sin, for his soul was lust-distraught.
<A NAME="508"></A><BR><BR>Here, there, on all sides crumbled flaming homes
<A NAME="509"></A><BR>In ruin down: scorched dust with smoke was blent:
<A NAME="510"></A><BR>Trembled the streets to the awful thunderous crash.
<A NAME="511"></A><BR>Here burned Aeneas' palace, yonder flamed
<A NAME="512"></A><BR>Antimachus' halls: one furnace was the height
<A NAME="513"></A><BR>Of fair-built Pergamus; flames were roaring round
<A NAME="514"></A><BR>Apollo's temple, round Athena's fane,
<A NAME="515"></A><BR>And round the Hearth-lord's altar: flames licked 
<A NAME="516"></A>up
<A NAME="517"></A><BR>Fair chambers of the sons' sons of a king;
<A NAME="518"></A><BR>And all the city sank down into hell.
<A NAME="519"></A><BR><BR>Of Trojans some by Argos' sons were slain,
<A NAME="520"></A><BR>Some by their own roofs crashing down in fire,
<A NAME="521"></A><BR>Giving at once in death and tomb to them:
<A NAME="522"></A><BR>Some in their own throats plunged the steel, when 
<A NAME="523"></A>foes
<A NAME="524"></A><BR>And fire were in the porch together seen:
<A NAME="525"></A><BR>Some slew their wives and children, and flung themselves
<A NAME="526"></A><BR>Dead on them, when despair had done its work
<A NAME="527"></A><BR>Of horror.  One, who deemed the foe afar,
<A NAME="528"></A><BR>Caught up a vase, and, fain to quench the flame,
<A NAME="529"></A><BR>Hasted for water.  Leapt unmarked on him
<A NAME="530"></A><BR>An Argive, and his spirit, heavy with wine,
<A NAME="531"></A><BR>Was thrust forth from the body by the spear.
<A NAME="532"></A><BR>Clashed the void vase above him, as he fell
<A NAME="533"></A><BR>Backward within the house.  As through his hall
<A NAME="534"></A><BR>Another fled, the burning roof-beam crashed
<A NAME="535"></A><BR>Down on his head, and swift death came with it.
<A NAME="536"></A><BR>And many women, as in frenzied flight
<A NAME="537"></A><BR>They rushed forth, suddenly remembered babes
<A NAME="538"></A><BR>Left in their beds beneath those burning roofs:
<A NAME="539"></A><BR>With wild feet sped they back -- the house fell 
<A NAME="540"></A>in
<A NAME="541"></A><BR>Upon them, and they perished, mother and child.
<A NAME="542"></A><BR>Horses and dogs in panic through the town
<A NAME="543"></A><BR>Fled from the flames, trampling beneath their feet
<A NAME="544"></A><BR>The dead, and dashing into living men
<A NAME="545"></A><BR>To their sore hurt.  Shrieks rang through all the 
<A NAME="546"></A>town.
<A NAME="547"></A><BR>In through his blazing porchway rushed a man
<A NAME="548"></A><BR>To rescue wife and child.  Through smoke and flame
<A NAME="549"></A><BR>Blindly he groped, and perished while he cried
<A NAME="550"></A><BR>Their names, and pitiless doom slew those within.
<A NAME="551"></A><BR><BR>The fire-glow upward mounted to the sky,
<A NAME="552"></A><BR>The red glare o'er the firmament spread its wings,
<A NAME="553"></A><BR>And all the tribes of folk that dwelt around
<A NAME="554"></A><BR>Beheld it, far as Ida's mountain-crests,
<A NAME="555"></A><BR>And sea-girt Tenedos, and Thracian Samos.
<A NAME="556"></A><BR>And men that voyaged on the deep sea cried:
<A NAME="557"></A><BR>"The Argives have achieved their mighty task
<A NAME="558"></A><BR>After long toil for star-eyed Helen's sake.
<A NAME="559"></A><BR>All Troy, the once queen-city, burns in fire:
<A NAME="560"></A><BR>For all their prayers, no God defends them now;
<A NAME="561"></A><BR>For strong Fate oversees all works of men,
<A NAME="562"></A><BR>And the renownless and obscure to fame
<A NAME="563"></A><BR>She raises, and brings low the exalted ones.
<A NAME="564"></A><BR>Oft out of good is evil brought, and good
<A NAME="565"></A><BR>From evil, mid the travail and change of life."
<A NAME="566"></A><BR><BR>So spake they, who from far beheld the glare
<A NAME="567"></A><BR>Of Troy's great burning.  Compassed were her folk
<A NAME="568"></A><BR>With wailing misery: through her streets the foe
<A NAME="569"></A><BR>Exulted, as when madding blasts turmoil
<A NAME="570"></A><BR>The boundless sea, what time the Altar ascends
<A NAME="571"></A><BR>To heaven's star-pavement, turned to the misty south
<A NAME="572"></A><BR>Overagainst Arcturus tempest-breathed,
<A NAME="573"></A><BR>And with its rising leap the wild winds forth,
<A NAME="574"></A><BR>And ships full many are whelmed 'neath ravening 
<A NAME="575"></A>seas;
<A NAME="576"></A><BR>Wild as those stormy winds Achaea's sons
<A NAME="577"></A><BR>Ravaged steep Ilium while she burned in flame.
<A NAME="578"></A><BR>As when a mountain clothed with shaggy woods
<A NAME="579"></A><BR>Burns swiftly in a fire-blast winged with winds,
<A NAME="580"></A><BR>And from her tall peaks goeth up a roar,
<A NAME="581"></A><BR>And all the forest-children this way and that
<A NAME="582"></A><BR>Rush through the wood, tormented by the flame;
<A NAME="583"></A><BR>So were the Trojans perishing: there was none
<A NAME="584"></A><BR>To save, of all the Gods.  Round these were staked
<A NAME="585"></A><BR>The nets of Fate, which no man can escape.
<A NAME="586"></A><BR><BR>Then were Demophoon and Acamas
<A NAME="587"></A><BR>By mighty Theseus' mother Aethra met.
<A NAME="588"></A><BR>Yearning to see them was she guided on
<A NAME="589"></A><BR>To meet them by some Blessed One, the while
<A NAME="590"></A><BR>'Wildered from war and fire she fled.  They saw
<A NAME="591"></A><BR>In that red glare a woman royal-tall,
<A NAME="592"></A><BR>Imperial-moulded, and they weened that this
<A NAME="593"></A><BR>Was Priam's queen, and with swift eagerness
<A NAME="594"></A><BR>Laid hands on her, to lead her captive thence
<A NAME="595"></A><BR>To the Danaans; but piteously she moaned:
<A NAME="596"></A><BR>"Ah, do not, noble sons of warrior Greeks,
<A NAME="597"></A><BR>To your ships hale me, as I were a foe!
<A NAME="598"></A><BR>I am not of Trojan birth: of Danaans came
<A NAME="599"></A><BR>My princely blood renowned.  In Troezen's halls
<A NAME="600"></A><BR>Pittheus begat me, Aegeus wedded me,
<A NAME="601"></A><BR>And of my womb sprang Theseus glory-crowned.
<A NAME="602"></A><BR>For great Zeus' sake, for your dear parents' sake,
<A NAME="603"></A><BR>I pray you, if the seed of Theseus came
<A NAME="604"></A><BR>Hither with Atreus' sons, O bring ye me
<A NAME="605"></A><BR>Unto their yearning eyes.  I trow they be
<A NAME="606"></A><BR>Young men like you.  My soul shall be refreshed
<A NAME="607"></A><BR>If living I behold those chieftains twain."
<A NAME="608"></A><BR><BR>Hearkening to her they called their sire to 
<A NAME="609"></A>mind,
<A NAME="610"></A><BR>His deeds for Helen's sake, and how the sons
<A NAME="611"></A><BR>Of Zeus the Thunderer in the old time smote
<A NAME="612"></A><BR>Aphidnae, when, because these were but babes,
<A NAME="613"></A><BR>Their nurses hid them far from peril of fight;
<A NAME="614"></A><BR>And Aethra they remembered -- all she endured
<A NAME="615"></A><BR>Through wars, as mother-in-law at first, and thrall
<A NAME="616"></A><BR>Thereafter of Helen.  Dumb for joy were they,
<A NAME="617"></A><BR>Till spake Demophoon to that wistful one:
<A NAME="618"></A><BR>"Even now the Gods fulfil thine heart's desire:
<A NAME="619"></A><BR>We whom thou seest are the sons of him,
<A NAME="620"></A><BR>Thy noble son: thee shall our loving hands
<A NAME="621"></A><BR>Bear to the ships: with joy to Hellas' soil
<A NAME="622"></A><BR>Thee will we bring, where once thou wast a queen."
<A NAME="623"></A><BR><BR>Then his great father's mother clasped him round
<A NAME="624"></A><BR>With clinging arms: she kissed his shoulders broad,
<A NAME="625"></A><BR>His head, his breast, his bearded lips she kissed,
<A NAME="626"></A><BR>And Acamas kissed withal, the while she shed
<A NAME="627"></A><BR>Glad tears on these who could not choose but weep.
<A NAME="628"></A><BR>As when one tarries long mid alien men,
<A NAME="629"></A><BR>And folk report him dead, but suddenly
<A NAME="630"></A><BR>He cometh home: his children see his face,
<A NAME="631"></A><BR>And break into glad weeping; yea, and he,
<A NAME="632"></A><BR>His arms around them, and their little heads
<A NAME="633"></A><BR>Upon his shoulders, sobs: echoes the home
<A NAME="634"></A><BR>With happy mourning's music-beating wings;
<A NAME="635"></A><BR>So wept they with sweet sighs and sorrowless moans.
<A NAME="636"></A><BR><BR>Then, too, affliction-burdened Priam's child,
<A NAME="637"></A><BR>Laodice, say they, stretched her hands to heaven,
<A NAME="638"></A><BR>Praying the mighty Gods that earth might gape
<A NAME="639"></A><BR>To swallow her, ere she defiled her hand
<A NAME="640"></A><BR>With thralls' work; and a God gave ear, and rent
<A NAME="641"></A><BR>Deep earth beneath her: so by Heaven's decree
<A NAME="642"></A><BR>Did earth's abysmal chasm receive the maid
<A NAME="643"></A><BR>In Troy's last hour.  Electra's self withal,
<A NAME="644"></A><BR>The Star-queen lovely-robed, shrouded her form
<A NAME="645"></A><BR>In mist and cloud, and left the Pleiad-band,
<A NAME="646"></A><BR>Her sisters, as the olden legend tells.
<A NAME="647"></A><BR>Still riseth up in sight of toil-worn men
<A NAME="648"></A><BR>Their bright troop in the skies; but she alone
<A NAME="649"></A><BR>Hides viewless ever, since the hallowed town
<A NAME="650"></A><BR>Of her son Dardanus in ruin fell,
<A NAME="651"></A><BR>When Zeus most high from heaven could help her not,
<A NAME="652"></A><BR>Because to Fate the might of Zeus must bow;
<A NAME="653"></A><BR>And by the Immortals' purpose all these things
<A NAME="654"></A><BR>Had come to pass, or by Fate's ordinance.
<A NAME="655"></A><BR><BR>Still on Troy's folk the Argives wreaked their 
<A NAME="656"></A>wrath,
<A NAME="657"></A><BR>And battle's issues Strife Incarnate held.
