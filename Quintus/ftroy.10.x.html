<A NAME="10"></A><B>How Paris Was Stricken To Death, and in Vain Sought Help of 
<A NAME="11"></A>Oenone</B>
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="12"></A>Now were the Trojans all without the town
<A NAME="13"></A><BR>Of Priam, armour-clad, with battle-cars
<A NAME="14"></A><BR>And chariot-steeds; for still they burnt their dead,
<A NAME="15"></A><BR>And still they feared lest the Achaean men
<A NAME="16"></A><BR>Should fall on them. They looked, and saw them come
<A NAME="17"></A><BR>With furious speed against the walls. In haste
<A NAME="18"></A><BR>They cast a hurried earth-mound o'er the slain,
<A NAME="19"></A><BR>For greatly trembled they to see their foes.
<A NAME="20"></A><BR>Then in their sore disquiet spake to them
<A NAME="21"></A><BR>Polydamas, a wise and prudent chief:
<A NAME="22"></A><BR>"Friends, unendurably against us now
<A NAME="23"></A><BR>Maddens the war.  Go to, let us devise
<A NAME="24"></A><BR>How we may find deliverance from our strait.
<A NAME="25"></A><BR>Still bide the Danaans here, still gather strength:
<A NAME="26"></A><BR>Now therefore let us man our stately towers,
<A NAME="27"></A><BR>And thence withstand them, fighting night and day,
<A NAME="28"></A><BR>Until yon Danaans weary, and return
<A NAME="29"></A><BR>To Sparta, or, renownless lingering here
<A NAME="30"></A><BR>Beside the wall, lose heart.  No strength of theirs
<A NAME="31"></A><BR>Shall breach the long walls, howsoe'er they strive,
<A NAME="32"></A><BR>For in the imperishable work of Gods
<A NAME="33"></A><BR>Weakness is none.  Food, drink, we shall not lack,
<A NAME="34"></A><BR>For in King Priam's gold-abounding halls
<A NAME="35"></A><BR>Is stored abundant food, that shall suffice
<A NAME="36"></A><BR>For many more than we, through many years,
<A NAME="37"></A><BR>Though thrice so great a host at our desire
<A NAME="38"></A><BR>Should gather, eager to maintain our cause."
<A NAME="39"></A><BR><BR>Then chode with him Anchises' valiant son:
<A NAME="40"></A><BR>"Polydamas, wherefore do they call thee wise,
<A NAME="41"></A><BR>Who biddest suffer endless tribulations
<A NAME="42"></A><BR>Cooped within walls?  Never, how long soe'er
<A NAME="43"></A><BR>The Achaeans tarry here, will they lose heart;
<A NAME="44"></A><BR>But when they see us skulking from the field,
<A NAME="45"></A><BR>More fiercely will press on.  So ours shall be
<A NAME="46"></A><BR>The sufferance, perishing in our native home,
<A NAME="47"></A><BR>If for long season they beleaguer us.
<A NAME="48"></A><BR>No food, if we be pent within our walls,
<A NAME="49"></A><BR>Shall Thebe send us, nor Maeonia wine,
<A NAME="50"></A><BR>But wretchedly by famine shall we die,
<A NAME="51"></A><BR>Though the great wall stand firm.  Nay, though our 
<A NAME="52"></A>lot
<A NAME="53"></A><BR>Should be to escape that evil death and doom,
<A NAME="54"></A><BR>And not by famine miserably to die;
<A NAME="55"></A><BR>Yet rather let us fight in armour clad
<A NAME="56"></A><BR>For children and grey fathers!  Haply Zeus
<A NAME="57"></A><BR>Will help us yet; of his high blood are we.
<A NAME="58"></A><BR>Nay, even though we be abhorred of him,
<A NAME="59"></A><BR>Better straightway to perish gloriously
<A NAME="60"></A><BR>Fighting unto the last for fatherland,
<A NAME="61"></A><BR>Than die a death of lingering agony!"
<A NAME="62"></A><BR><BR>Shouted they all who heard that gallant rede.
<A NAME="63"></A><BR>Swiftly with helms and shields and spears they stood
<A NAME="64"></A><BR>In close array.  The eyes of mighty Zeus
<A NAME="65"></A><BR>From heaven beheld the Trojans armed for fight
<A NAME="66"></A><BR>Against the Danaans: then did he awake
<A NAME="67"></A><BR>Courage in these and those, that there might be
<A NAME="68"></A><BR>Strain of unflinching fight 'twixt host and host.
<A NAME="69"></A><BR>That day was Paris doomed, for Helen's sake
<A NAME="70"></A><BR>Fighting, by Philoctetes' hands to die.
<A NAME="71"></A><BR><BR>To one place Strife incarnate drew them all,
<A NAME="72"></A><BR>The fearful Battle-queen, beheld of none,
<A NAME="73"></A><BR>But cloaked in clouds blood-raining: on she stalked
<A NAME="74"></A><BR>Swelling the mighty roar of battle, now
<A NAME="75"></A><BR>Rushed through Troy's squadrons, through Achaea's 
<A NAME="76"></A>now;
<A NAME="77"></A><BR>Panic and Fear still waited on her steps
<A NAME="78"></A><BR>To make their father's sister glorious.
<A NAME="79"></A><BR>From small to huge that Fury's stature grew;
<A NAME="80"></A><BR>Her arms of adamant were blood-besprent,
<A NAME="81"></A><BR>The deadly lance she brandished reached the sky.
<A NAME="82"></A><BR>Earth quaked beneath her feet: dread blasts of fire
<A NAME="83"></A><BR>Flamed from her mouth: her voice pealed thunder-like
<A NAME="84"></A><BR>Kindling strong men.  Swift closed the fronts of 
<A NAME="85"></A>fight
<A NAME="86"></A><BR>Drawn by a dread Power to the mighty work.
<A NAME="87"></A><BR>Loud as the shriek of winds that madly blow
<A NAME="88"></A><BR>In early spring, when the tall woodland trees
<A NAME="89"></A><BR>Put forth their leaves -- loud as the roar of fire
<A NAME="90"></A><BR>Blazing through sun-scorched brakes -- loud as the 
<A NAME="91"></A>voice
<A NAME="92"></A><BR>Of many waters, when the wide sea raves
<A NAME="93"></A><BR>Beneath the howling blast, with thunderous crash
<A NAME="94"></A><BR>Of waves, when shake the fearful shipman's knees;
<A NAME="95"></A><BR>So thundered earth beneath their charging feet.
<A NAME="96"></A><BR>Strife swooped on them: foe hurled himself on foe.
<A NAME="97"></A><BR><BR>First did Aeneas of the Danaans slay
<A NAME="98"></A><BR>Harpalion, Arizelus' scion, born
<A NAME="99"></A><BR>In far Boeotia of Amphinome,
<A NAME="100"></A><BR>Who came to Troy to help the Argive men
<A NAME="101"></A><BR>With godlike Prothoenor.  'Neath his waist
<A NAME="102"></A><BR>Aeneas stabbed, and reft sweet life from him.
<A NAME="103"></A><BR>Dead upon him he cast Thersander's son,
<A NAME="104"></A><BR>For the barbed javelin pierced through Hyllus' throat
<A NAME="105"></A><BR>Whom Arethusa by Lethaeus bare
<A NAME="106"></A><BR>In Crete: sore grieved Idomeneus for his fall.
<A NAME="107"></A><BR><BR>By this Peleides' son had swiftly slain
<A NAME="108"></A><BR>Twelve Trojan warriors with his father's spear.
<A NAME="109"></A><BR>First Cebrus fell, Harmon, Pasitheus then,
<A NAME="110"></A><BR>Hysminus, Schedius, and Imbrasius,
<A NAME="111"></A><BR>Phleges, Mnesaeus, Ennomus, Amphinous,
<A NAME="112"></A><BR>Phasis, Galenus last, who had his home
<A NAME="113"></A><BR><BR>By Gargarus' steep -- a mighty warrior he
<A NAME="114"></A><BR>Among Troy's mighties: with a countless host
<A NAME="115"></A><BR>To Troy he came: for Priam Dardanus' son
<A NAME="116"></A><BR>Promised him many gifts and passing fair.
<A NAME="117"></A><BR>Ah fool!  his own doom never he foresaw,
<A NAME="118"></A><BR>Whose weird was suddenly to fall in fight
<A NAME="119"></A><BR>Ere he bore home King Priam's glorious gifts.
<A NAME="120"></A><BR><BR>Doom the Destroyer against the Argives sped
<A NAME="121"></A><BR>Valiant Aeneas' friend, Eurymenes.
<A NAME="122"></A><BR>Wild courage spurred him on, that he might slay
<A NAME="123"></A><BR>Many -- and then fill death's cup for himself.
<A NAME="124"></A><BR>Man after man he slew like some fierce beast,
<A NAME="125"></A><BR>And foes shrank from the terrible rage that burned
<A NAME="126"></A><BR>On his life's verge, nor reeked of imminent doom.
<A NAME="127"></A><BR>Yea, peerless deeds in that fight had he done,
<A NAME="128"></A><BR>Had not his hands grown weary, his spear-head
<A NAME="129"></A><BR>Bent utterly: his sword availed him not,
<A NAME="130"></A><BR>Snapped at the hilt by Fate.  Then Meges' dart
<A NAME="131"></A><BR>Smote 'neath his ribs; blood spurted from his mouth,
<A NAME="132"></A><BR>And in death's agony Doom stood at his side.
<A NAME="133"></A><BR><BR>Even as he fell, Epeius' henchmen twain,
<A NAME="134"></A><BR>Deileon and Amphion, rushed to strip
<A NAME="135"></A><BR>His armour; but Aeneas brave and strong
<A NAME="136"></A><BR>Chilled their hot hearts in death beside the dead.
<A NAME="137"></A><BR>As one in latter summer 'mid his vines
<A NAME="138"></A><BR>Kills wasps that dart about his ripening grapes,
<A NAME="139"></A><BR>And so, ere they may taste the fruit, they die;
<A NAME="140"></A><BR>So smote he them, ere they could seize the arms.
<A NAME="141"></A><BR><BR>Menon and Amphinous Tydeides slew,
<A NAME="142"></A><BR>Both goodly men.  Paris slew Hippasus' son
<A NAME="143"></A><BR>Demoleon, who in Laconia's land
<A NAME="144"></A><BR>Beside the outfall of Eurotas dwelt,
<A NAME="145"></A><BR>The stream deep-flowing, and to Troy he came
<A NAME="146"></A><BR>With Menelaus.  Under his right breast
<A NAME="147"></A><BR>The shaft of Paris smote him unto death,
<A NAME="148"></A><BR>Driving his soul forth like a scattering breath.
<A NAME="149"></A><BR><BR>Teucer slew Zechis, Medon's war-famed son,
<A NAME="150"></A><BR>Who dwelt in Phrygia, land of myriad flocks,
<A NAME="151"></A><BR>Below that haunted cave of fair-haired Nymphs
<A NAME="152"></A><BR>Where, as Endymion slept beside his kine,
<A NAME="153"></A><BR>Divine Selene watched him from on high,
<A NAME="154"></A><BR>And slid from heaven to earth; for passionate love
<A NAME="155"></A><BR>Drew down the immortal stainless Queen of Night.
<A NAME="156"></A><BR>And a memorial of her couch abides
<A NAME="157"></A><BR>Still 'neath the oaks; for mid the copses round
<A NAME="158"></A><BR>Was poured out milk of kine; and still do men
<A NAME="159"></A><BR>Marvelling behold its whiteness.  Thou wouldst say
<A NAME="160"></A><BR>Far off that this was milk indeed, which is
<A NAME="161"></A><BR>A well-spring of white water: if thou draw
<A NAME="162"></A><BR>A little nigher, lo, the stream is fringed
<A NAME="163"></A><BR>As though with ice, for white stone rims it round.
<A NAME="164"></A><BR><BR>Rushed on Alcaeus Meges, Phyleus' son,
<A NAME="165"></A><BR>And drave his spear beneath his fluttering heart.
<A NAME="166"></A><BR>Loosed were the cords of sweet life suddenly,
<A NAME="167"></A><BR>And his sad parents longed in vain to greet
<A NAME="168"></A><BR>That son returning from the woeful war
<A NAME="169"></A><BR>To Margasus and Phyllis lovely-girt,
<A NAME="170"></A><BR>Dwellers by lucent streams of Harpasus,
<A NAME="171"></A><BR>Who pours the full blood of his clamorous flow
<A NAME="172"></A><BR>Into Maeander madly rushing aye.
<A NAME="173"></A><BR><BR>With Glaucus' warrior-comrade Scylaceus
<A NAME="174"></A><BR>Odeus' son closed in the fight, and stabbed
<A NAME="175"></A><BR>Over the shield-rim, and the cruel spear
<A NAME="176"></A><BR>Passed through his shoulder, and drenched his shield with 
<A NAME="177"></A>blood.
<A NAME="178"></A><BR>Howbeit he slew him not, whose day of doom
<A NAME="179"></A><BR>Awaited him afar beside the wall
<A NAME="180"></A><BR>Of his own city; for when Illium's towers
<A NAME="181"></A><BR>Were brought low by that swift avenging host
<A NAME="182"></A><BR>Fleeing the war to Lycia then he came
<A NAME="183"></A><BR>Alone; and when he drew nigh to the town,
<A NAME="184"></A><BR>The thronging women met and questioned him
<A NAME="185"></A><BR>Touching their sons and husbands; and he told
<A NAME="186"></A><BR>How all were dead. They compassed him about,
<A NAME="187"></A><BR>And stoned the man with great stones, that he died.
<A NAME="188"></A><BR>So had he no joy of his winning home,
<A NAME="189"></A><BR>But the stones muffled up his dying groans,
<A NAME="190"></A><BR>And of the same his ghastly tomb was reared
<A NAME="191"></A><BR>Beside Bellerophon's grave and holy place
<A NAME="192"></A><BR>In Tlos, nigh that far-famed Chimaera's Crag.
<A NAME="193"></A><BR>Yet, though he thus fulfilled his day of doom,
<A NAME="194"></A><BR>As a God afterward men worshipped him
<A NAME="195"></A><BR>By Phoebus' hest, and never his honour fades.
<A NAME="196"></A><BR><BR>Now Poeas' son the while slew Deioneus
<A NAME="197"></A><BR>And Acamas, Antenor's warrior son:
<A NAME="198"></A><BR>Yea, a great host of strong men laid he low.
<A NAME="199"></A><BR>On, like the War-god, through his foes he rushed,
<A NAME="200"></A><BR>Or as a river roaring in full flood
<A NAME="201"></A><BR>Breaks down long dykes, when, maddening round its 
<A NAME="202"></A>rocks,
<A NAME="203"></A><BR>Down from the mountains swelled by rain it pours
<A NAME="204"></A><BR>An ever-flowing mightily-rushing stream
<A NAME="205"></A><BR>Whose foaming crests over its forelands sweep;
<A NAME="206"></A><BR>So none who saw him even from afar
<A NAME="207"></A><BR>Dared meet renowned Poeas' valiant son,
<A NAME="208"></A><BR>Whose breast with battle-fury was fulfilled,
<A NAME="209"></A><BR>Whose limbs were clad in mighty Hercules' arms
<A NAME="210"></A><BR>Of cunning workmanship; for on the belt
<A NAME="211"></A><BR>Gleamed bears most grim and savage, jackals fell,
<A NAME="212"></A><BR>And panthers, in whose eyes there seems to lurk
<A NAME="213"></A><BR>A deadly smile.  There were fierce-hearted wolves,
<A NAME="214"></A><BR>And boars with flashing tusks, and mighty lions
<A NAME="215"></A><BR>All seeming strangely alive; and, there portrayed
<A NAME="216"></A><BR>Through all its breadth, were battles murder-rife.
<A NAME="217"></A><BR>With all these marvels covered was the belt;
<A NAME="218"></A><BR>And with yet more the quiver was adorned.
<A NAME="219"></A><BR>There Hermes was, storm-footed Son of Zeus,
<A NAME="220"></A><BR>Slaying huge Argus nigh to Inachus' streams,
<A NAME="221"></A><BR>Argus, whose sentinel eyes in turn took sleep.
<A NAME="222"></A><BR>And there was Phaethon from the Sun-car hurled
<A NAME="223"></A><BR>Into Eridanus.  Earth verily seemed
<A NAME="224"></A><BR>Ablaze, and black smoke hovered on the air.
<A NAME="225"></A><BR>There Perseus slew Medusa gorgon-eyed
<A NAME="226"></A><BR>By the stars' baths and utmost bounds of earth
<A NAME="227"></A><BR>And fountains of deep-flowing Ocean, where
<A NAME="228"></A><BR>Night in the far west meets the setting sun.
<A NAME="229"></A><BR>There was the Titan Iapetus' great son
<A NAME="230"></A><BR>Hung from the beetling crag of Caucasus
<A NAME="231"></A><BR>In bonds of adamant, and the eagle tare
<A NAME="232"></A><BR>His liver unconsumed -- he seemed to groan!
<A NAME="233"></A><BR>All these Hephaestus' cunning hands had wrought
<A NAME="234"></A><BR>For Hercules; and these to Poeas' son,
<A NAME="235"></A><BR>Most near of friends and dear, he gave to bear.
<A NAME="236"></A><BR><BR>So glorying in those arms he smote the foe.
<A NAME="237"></A><BR>But Paris at the last to meet him sprang
<A NAME="238"></A><BR>Fearlessly, bearing in his hands his bow
<A NAME="239"></A><BR>And deadly arrows -- but his latest day
<A NAME="240"></A><BR>Now met himself.  A flying shaft he sped
<A NAME="241"></A><BR>Forth from the string, which sang as leapt the dart,
<A NAME="242"></A><BR>Which flew not vainly: yet the very mark
<A NAME="243"></A><BR>It missed, for Philoctetes swerved aside
<A NAME="244"></A><BR>A hair-breadth, and it smote above the breast
<A NAME="245"></A><BR>Cleodorus war-renowned, and cleft a path
<A NAME="246"></A><BR>Clear through his shoulder; for he had not now
<A NAME="247"></A><BR>The buckler broad which wont to fence from death
<A NAME="248"></A><BR>Its bearer, but was falling back from fight,
<A NAME="249"></A><BR>Being shieldless; for Polydamas' massy lance
<A NAME="250"></A><BR>Had cleft the shoulder-belt whereby his targe
<A NAME="251"></A><BR>Hung, and he gave back therefore, fighting still
<A NAME="252"></A><BR>With stubborn spear.  But now the arrow of death
<A NAME="253"></A><BR>Fell on him, as from ambush leaping forth.
<A NAME="254"></A><BR>For so Fate willed, I trow, to bring dread doom
<A NAME="255"></A><BR>On noble-hearted Lernus' scion, born
<A NAME="256"></A><BR>Of Amphiale, in Rhodes the fertile land.
<A NAME="257"></A><BR><BR>But soon as Poeas' battle-eager son
<A NAME="258"></A><BR>Marked him by Paris' deadly arrow slain,
<A NAME="259"></A><BR>Swiftly he strained his bow, shouting aloud:
<A NAME="260"></A><BR>"Dog!  I will give thee death, will speed thee down
<A NAME="261"></A><BR>To the Unseen Land, who darest to brave me!
<A NAME="262"></A><BR>And so shall they have rest, who travail now
<A NAME="263"></A><BR>For thy vile sake.  Destruction shall have end
<A NAME="264"></A><BR>When thou art dead, the author of our bane."
<A NAME="265"></A><BR><BR>Then to his breast he drew the plaited cord.
<A NAME="266"></A><BR>The great bow arched, the merciless shaft was aimed
<A NAME="267"></A><BR>Straight, and the terrible point a little peered
<A NAME="268"></A><BR>Above the bow, in that constraining grip.
<A NAME="269"></A><BR>Loud sang the string, as the death-hissing shaft
<A NAME="270"></A><BR>Leapt, and missed not: yet was not Paris' heart
<A NAME="271"></A><BR>Stilled, but his spirit yet was strong in him;
<A NAME="272"></A><BR>For that first arrow was not winged with death:
<A NAME="273"></A><BR>It did but graze the fair flesh by his wrist.
<A NAME="274"></A><BR>Then once again the avenger drew the bow,
<A NAME="275"></A><BR>And the barbed shaft of Poeas' son had plunged,
<A NAME="276"></A><BR>Ere he could swerve, 'twixt flank and groin.  No 
<A NAME="277"></A>more
<A NAME="278"></A><BR>He abode the fight, but swiftly hasted back
<A NAME="279"></A><BR>As hastes a dog which on a lion rushed
<A NAME="280"></A><BR>At first, then fleeth terror-stricken back.
<A NAME="281"></A><BR>So he, his very heart with agony thrilled,
<A NAME="282"></A><BR>Fled from the war.  Still clashed the grappling 
<A NAME="283"></A>hosts,
<A NAME="284"></A><BR>Man slaying man: aye bloodier waxed the fray
<A NAME="285"></A><BR>As rained the blows: corpse upon corpse was flung
<A NAME="286"></A><BR>Confusedly, like thunder-drops, or flakes
<A NAME="287"></A><BR>Of snow, or hailstones, by the wintry blast
<A NAME="288"></A><BR>At Zeus' behest strewn over the long hills
<A NAME="289"></A><BR>And forest-boughs; so by a pitiless doom
<A NAME="290"></A><BR>Slain, friends with foes in heaps on heaps were 
<A NAME="291"></A>strown.
<A NAME="292"></A><BR><BR>Sorely groaned Paris; with the torturing wound
<A NAME="293"></A><BR>Fainted his spirit.  Leeches sought to allay
<A NAME="294"></A><BR>His frenzy of pain.  But now drew back to Troy
<A NAME="295"></A><BR>The Trojans, and the Danaans to their ships
<A NAME="296"></A><BR>Swiftly returned, for dark night put an end
<A NAME="297"></A><BR>To strife, and stole from men's limbs weariness,
<A NAME="298"></A><BR>Pouring upon their eyes pain-healing sleep.
<A NAME="299"></A><BR><BR>But through the livelong night no sleep laid 
<A NAME="300"></A>hold
<A NAME="301"></A><BR>On Paris: for his help no leech availed,
<A NAME="302"></A><BR>Though ne'er so willing, with his salves.  His weird
<A NAME="303"></A><BR>Was only by Oenone's hands to escape
<A NAME="304"></A><BR>Death's doom, if so she willed.  Now he obeyed
<A NAME="305"></A><BR>The prophecy, and he went -- exceeding loth,
<A NAME="306"></A><BR>But grim necessity forced him thence, to face
<A NAME="307"></A><BR>The wife forsaken.  Evil-boding fowl
<A NAME="308"></A><BR>Shrieked o'er his head, or darted past to left,
<A NAME="309"></A><BR>Still as he went.  Now, as he looked at them,
<A NAME="310"></A><BR>His heart sank; now hope whispered, "Haply vain
<A NAME="311"></A><BR>Their bodings are!" but on their wings were borne
<A NAME="312"></A><BR>Visions of doom that blended with his pain.
<A NAME="313"></A><BR>Into Oenone's presence thus he came.
<A NAME="314"></A><BR>Amazed her thronging handmaids looked on him
<A NAME="315"></A><BR>As at the Nymph's feet that pale suppliant fell
<A NAME="316"></A><BR>Faint with the anguish of his wound, whose pangs
<A NAME="317"></A><BR>Stabbed him through brain and heart, yea, quivered 
<A NAME="318"></A>through
<A NAME="319"></A><BR>His very bones, for that fierce venom crawled
<A NAME="320"></A><BR>Through all his inwards with corrupting fangs;
<A NAME="321"></A><BR>And his life fainted in him agony-thrilled.
<A NAME="322"></A><BR>As one with sickness and tormenting thirst
<A NAME="323"></A><BR>Consumed, lies parched, with heart quick-shuddering,
<A NAME="324"></A><BR>With liver seething as in flame, the soul,
<A NAME="325"></A><BR>Scarce conscious, fluttering at his burning lips,
<A NAME="326"></A><BR>Longing for life, for water longing sore;
<A NAME="327"></A><BR>So was his breast one fire of torturing pain.
<A NAME="328"></A><BR>Then in exceeding feebleness he spake:
<A NAME="329"></A><BR>"O reverenced wife, turn not from me in hate
<A NAME="330"></A><BR>For that I left thee widowed long ago!
<A NAME="331"></A><BR>Not of my will I did it: the strong Fates
<A NAME="332"></A><BR>Dragged me to Helen -- oh that I had died
<A NAME="333"></A><BR>Ere I embraced her -- in thine arms had died!
<A NAME="334"></A><BR>All, by the Gods I pray, the Lords of Heaven,
<A NAME="335"></A><BR>By all the memories of our wedded love,
<A NAME="336"></A><BR>Be merciful!  Banish my bitter pain:
<A NAME="337"></A><BR>Lay on my deadly wound those healing salves
<A NAME="338"></A><BR>Which only can, by Fate's decree, remove
<A NAME="339"></A><BR>This torment, if thou wilt.  Thine heart must speak
<A NAME="340"></A><BR>My sentence, to be saved from death or no.
<A NAME="341"></A><BR>Pity me -- oh, make haste to pity me!
<A NAME="342"></A><BR>This venom's might is swiftly bringing death!
<A NAME="343"></A><BR>Heal me, while life yet lingers in my limbs!
<A NAME="344"></A><BR>Remember not those pangs of jealousy,
<A NAME="345"></A><BR>Nor leave me by a cruel doom to die
<A NAME="346"></A><BR>Low fallen at thy feet!  This should offend
<A NAME="347"></A><BR>The Prayers, the Daughters of the Thunderer Zeus,
<A NAME="348"></A><BR>Whose anger followeth unrelenting pride
<A NAME="349"></A><BR>With vengeance, and the Erinnys executes
<A NAME="350"></A><BR>Their wrath.  My queen, I sinned, in folly sinned;
<A NAME="351"></A><BR>Yet from death save me -- oh, make haste to save!"
<A NAME="352"></A><BR><BR>So prayed he; but her darkly-brooding heart
<A NAME="353"></A><BR>Was steeled, and her words mocked his agony:
<A NAME="354"></A><BR>"Thou comest unto me! -- thou, who didst leave
<A NAME="355"></A><BR>Erewhile a wailing wife in a desolate home! --
<A NAME="356"></A><BR>Didst leave her for thy Tyndarid darling!  Go,
<A NAME="357"></A><BR>Lie laughing in her arms for bliss!  She is better
<A NAME="358"></A><BR>Than thy true wife -- is, rumour saith, immortal!
<A NAME="359"></A><BR>Make haste to kneel to her but not to me!
<A NAME="360"></A><BR>Weep not to me, nor whimper pitiful prayers!
<A NAME="361"></A><BR>Oh that mine heart beat with a tigress' strength,
<A NAME="362"></A><BR>That I might tear thy flesh and lap thy blood
<A NAME="363"></A><BR>For all the pain thy folly brought on me!
<A NAME="364"></A><BR>Vile wretch!  where now is Love's Queen glory-crowned?
<A NAME="365"></A><BR>Hath Zeus forgotten his daughter's paramour?
<A NAME="366"></A><BR>Have them for thy deliverers!  Get thee hence
<A NAME="367"></A><BR>Far from my dwelling, curse of Gods and men!
<A NAME="368"></A><BR>Yea, for through thee, thou miscreant, sorrow came
<A NAME="369"></A><BR>On deathless Gods, for sons and sons' sons slain.
<A NAME="370"></A><BR>Hence from my threshold! -- to thine Helen go!
<A NAME="371"></A><BR>Agonize day and night beside her bed:
<A NAME="372"></A><BR>There whimper, pierced to the heart with cruel pangs,
<A NAME="373"></A><BR>Until she heal thee of thy grievous pain."
<A NAME="374"></A><BR><BR>So from her doors she drave that groaning man 
<A NAME="375"></A>--
<A NAME="376"></A><BR>Ah fool!  not knowing her own doom, whose weird
<A NAME="377"></A><BR>Was straightway after him to tread the path
<A NAME="378"></A><BR>Of death!  So Fate had spun her destiny-thread.
<A NAME="379"></A><BR><BR>Then, as he stumbled down through Ida's brakes,
<A NAME="380"></A><BR>Where Doom on his death-path was leading him
<A NAME="381"></A><BR>Painfully halting, racked with heart-sick pain,
<A NAME="382"></A><BR>Hera beheld him, with rejoicing soul
<A NAME="383"></A><BR>Throned in the Olympian palace-court of Zeus.
<A NAME="384"></A><BR>And seated at her side were handmaids four
<A NAME="385"></A><BR>Whom radiant-faced Selene bare to the Sun
<A NAME="386"></A><BR>To be unwearying ministers in Heaven,
<A NAME="387"></A><BR>In form and office diverse each from each;
<A NAME="388"></A><BR>For of these Seasons one was summer's queen,
<A NAME="389"></A><BR>And one of winter and his stormy star,
<A NAME="390"></A><BR>Of spring the third, of autumn-tide the fourth.
<A NAME="391"></A><BR>So in four portions parted is man's year
<A NAME="392"></A><BR>Ruled by these Queens in turn -- but of all this
<A NAME="393"></A><BR>Be Zeus himself the Overseer in heaven.
<A NAME="394"></A><BR>And of those issues now these spake with her
<A NAME="395"></A><BR>Which baleful Fate in her all-ruining heart
<A NAME="396"></A><BR>Was shaping to the birth the new espousals
<A NAME="397"></A><BR>Of Helen, fatal to Deiphobus --
<A NAME="398"></A><BR>The wrath of Helenus, who hoped in vain
<A NAME="399"></A><BR>For that fair bride, and how, when he had fled,
<A NAME="400"></A><BR>Wroth with the Trojans, to the mountain-height,
<A NAME="401"></A><BR>Achaea's sons would seize him and would hale
<A NAME="402"></A><BR>Unto their ships -- how, by his counselling
<A NAME="403"></A><BR>Strong Tydeus' son should with Odysseus scale
<A NAME="404"></A><BR>The great wall, and should slay Alcathous
<A NAME="405"></A><BR>The temple-warder, and should bear away
<A NAME="406"></A><BR>Pallas the Gracious, with her free consent,
<A NAME="407"></A><BR>Whose image was the sure defence of Troy; --
<A NAME="408"></A><BR>Yea, for not even a God, how wroth soe'er,
<A NAME="409"></A><BR>Had power to lay the City of Priam waste
<A NAME="410"></A><BR>While that immortal shape stood warder there.
<A NAME="411"></A><BR>No man had carven that celestial form,
<A NAME="412"></A><BR>But Cronos' Son himself had cast it down
<A NAME="413"></A><BR>From heaven to Priam's gold-abounding burg.
<A NAME="414"></A><BR><BR>Of these things with her handmaids did the Queen
<A NAME="415"></A><BR>Of Heaven hold converse, and of many such,
<A NAME="416"></A><BR>But Paris, while they talked, gave up the ghost
<A NAME="417"></A><BR>On Ida: never Helen saw him more.
<A NAME="418"></A><BR>Loud wailed the Nymphs around him; for they still
<A NAME="419"></A><BR>Remembered how their nursling wont to lisp
<A NAME="420"></A><BR>His childish prattle, compassed with their smiles.
<A NAME="421"></A><BR>And with them mourned the neatherds light of foot,
<A NAME="422"></A><BR>Sorrowful-hearted; moaned the mountain-glens.
<A NAME="423"></A><BR><BR>Then unto travail-burdened Priam's queen
<A NAME="424"></A><BR>A herdman told the dread doom of her son.
<A NAME="425"></A><BR>Wildly her trembling heart leapt when she heard;
<A NAME="426"></A><BR>With failing limbs she sank to earth and wailed:
<A NAME="427"></A><BR>"Dead!  thou dead, O dear child!  Grief heaped on 
<A NAME="428"></A>grief
<A NAME="429"></A><BR>Hast thou bequeathed me, grief eternal!  Best
<A NAME="430"></A><BR>Of all my sons, save Hector alone, wast thou!
<A NAME="431"></A><BR>While beats my heart, my grief shall weep for thee.
<A NAME="432"></A><BR>The hand of Heaven is in our sufferings:
<A NAME="433"></A><BR>Some Fate devised our ruin -- oh that I
<A NAME="434"></A><BR>Had lived not to endure it, but had died
<A NAME="435"></A><BR>In days of wealthy peace!  But now I see
<A NAME="436"></A><BR>Woes upon woes, and ever look to see
<A NAME="437"></A><BR>Worse things -- my children slain, my city sacked
<A NAME="438"></A><BR>And burned with fire by stony-hearted foes,
<A NAME="439"></A><BR>Daughters, sons' wives, all Trojan women, haled
<A NAME="440"></A><BR>Into captivity with our little ones!"
<A NAME="441"></A><BR><BR>So wailed she; but the King heard naught thereof,
<A NAME="442"></A><BR>But weeping ever sat by Hector's grave,
<A NAME="443"></A><BR>For most of all his sons he honoured him,
<A NAME="444"></A><BR>His mightiest, the defender of his land.
<A NAME="445"></A><BR>Nothing of Paris knew that pierced heart;
<A NAME="446"></A><BR>But long and loud lamented Helen; yet
<A NAME="447"></A><BR>Those wails were but for Trojan ears; her soul
<A NAME="448"></A><BR>With other thoughts was busy, as she cried:
<A NAME="449"></A><BR>"Husband, to me, to Troy, and to thyself
<A NAME="450"></A><BR>A bitter blow is this thy woeful death!
<A NAME="451"></A><BR>In misery hast thou left me, and I look
<A NAME="452"></A><BR>To see calamities more deadly yet.
<A NAME="453"></A><BR>Oh that the Spirits of the Storm had snatched
<A NAME="454"></A><BR>Me from the earth when first I fared with thee
<A NAME="455"></A><BR>Drawn by a baleful Fate!  It might not be;
<A NAME="456"></A><BR>The Gods have meted ruin to thee and me.
<A NAME="457"></A><BR>With shuddering horror all men look on me,
<A NAME="458"></A><BR>All hate me!  Place of refuge is there none
<A NAME="459"></A><BR>For me; for if to the Danaan host I fly,
<A NAME="460"></A><BR>With torments will they greet me.  If I stay,
<A NAME="461"></A><BR>Troy's sons and daughters here will compass me
<A NAME="462"></A><BR>And rend me.  Earth shall cover not my corpse,
<A NAME="463"></A><BR>But dogs and fowl of ravin shall devour.
<A NAME="464"></A><BR>Oh had Fate slain me ere I saw these woes!"
<A NAME="465"></A><BR><BR>So cried she: but for him far less she mourned
<A NAME="466"></A><BR>Than for herself, remembering her own sin.
<A NAME="467"></A><BR>Yea, and Troy's daughters but in semblance wailed
<A NAME="468"></A><BR>For him: of other woes their hearts were full.
<A NAME="469"></A><BR>Some thought on parents, some on husbands slain,
<A NAME="470"></A><BR>These on their sons, on honoured kinsmen those.
<A NAME="471"></A><BR><BR>One only heart was pierced with grief unfeigned,
<A NAME="472"></A><BR>Oenone.  Not with them of Troy she wailed,
<A NAME="473"></A><BR>But far away within that desolate home
<A NAME="474"></A><BR>Moaning she lay on her lost husband's bed.
<A NAME="475"></A><BR>As when the copses on high mountains stand
<A NAME="476"></A><BR>White-veiled with frozen snow, which o'er the glens
<A NAME="477"></A><BR>The west-wind blasts have strown, but now the sun
<A NAME="478"></A><BR>And east-wind melt it fast, and the long heights
<A NAME="479"></A><BR>With water-courses stream, and down the glades
<A NAME="480"></A><BR>Slide, as they thaw, the heavy sheets, to swell
<A NAME="481"></A><BR>The rushing waters of an ice-cold spring,
<A NAME="482"></A><BR>So melted she in tears of anguished pain,
<A NAME="483"></A><BR>And for her own, her husband, agonised,
<A NAME="484"></A><BR>And cried to her heart with miserable moans:
<A NAME="485"></A><BR>"Woe for my wickedness!  O hateful life!
<A NAME="486"></A><BR>I loved mine hapless husband -- dreamed with him
<A NAME="487"></A><BR>To pace to eld's bright threshold hand in hand,
<A NAME="488"></A><BR>And heart in heart!  The gods ordained not so.
<A NAME="489"></A><BR>Oh had the black Fates snatched me from the earth
<A NAME="490"></A><BR>Ere I from Paris turned away in hate!
<A NAME="491"></A><BR>My living love hath left me! -- yet will I
<A NAME="492"></A><BR>Dare to die with him, for I loathe the light."
<A NAME="493"></A><BR><BR>So cried she, weeping, weeping piteously,
<A NAME="494"></A><BR>Remembering him whom death had swallowed up,
<A NAME="495"></A><BR>Wasting, as melteth wax before the flame
<A NAME="496"></A><BR>Yet secretly, being fearful lest her sire
<A NAME="497"></A><BR>Should mark it, or her handmaids till the night
<A NAME="498"></A><BR>Rose from broad Ocean, flooding all the earth
<A NAME="499"></A><BR>With darkness bringing men release from toil.
<A NAME="500"></A><BR>Then, while her father and her maidens slept,
<A NAME="501"></A><BR>She slid the bolts back of the outer doors,
<A NAME="502"></A><BR>And rushed forth like a storm-blast.  Fast she ran,
<A NAME="503"></A><BR>As when a heifer 'mid the mountains speeds,
<A NAME="504"></A><BR>Her heart with passion stung, to meet her mate,
<A NAME="505"></A><BR>And madly races on with flying feet,
<A NAME="506"></A><BR>And fears not, in her frenzy of desire,
<A NAME="507"></A><BR>The herdman, as her wild rush bears her on,
<A NAME="508"></A><BR>So she but find her mate amid the woods;
<A NAME="509"></A><BR>So down the long tracks flew Oenone's feet;
<A NAME="510"></A><BR>Seeking the awful pyre, to leap thereon.
<A NAME="511"></A><BR>No weariness she knew: as upon wings
<A NAME="512"></A><BR>Her feet flew faster ever, onward spurred
<A NAME="513"></A><BR>By fell Fate, and the Cyprian Queen.  She feared
<A NAME="514"></A><BR>No shaggy beast that met her in the dark
<A NAME="515"></A><BR>Who erst had feared them sorely -- rugged rock
<A NAME="516"></A><BR>And precipice of tangled mountain-slope,
<A NAME="517"></A><BR>She trod them all unstumbling; torrent-beds
<A NAME="518"></A><BR>She leapt.  The white Moon-goddess from on high
<A NAME="519"></A><BR>Looked on her, and remembered her own love,
<A NAME="520"></A><BR>Princely Endymion, and she pitied her
<A NAME="521"></A><BR>In that wild race, and, shining overhead
<A NAME="522"></A><BR>In her full brightness, made the long tracks plain.
<A NAME="523"></A><BR><BR>Through mountain-gorges so she won to where
<A NAME="524"></A><BR>Wailed other Nymphs round Alexander's corpse.
<A NAME="525"></A><BR>Roared up about him a great wall of fire;
<A NAME="526"></A><BR>For from the mountains far and near had come
<A NAME="527"></A><BR>Shepherds, and heaped the death-bale broad and high
<A NAME="528"></A><BR>For 1ove's and sorrow's latest service done
<A NAME="529"></A><BR>To one of old their comrade and their king.
<A NAME="530"></A><BR>Sore weeping stood they round.  She raised no wail,
<A NAME="531"></A><BR>The broken-hearted, when she saw him there,
<A NAME="532"></A><BR>But, in her mantle muffling up her face,
<A NAME="533"></A><BR>Leapt on the pyre: loud wailed that multitude.
<A NAME="534"></A><BR>There burned she, clasping Paris.  All the Nymphs
<A NAME="535"></A><BR>Marvelled, beholding her beside her lord
<A NAME="536"></A><BR>Flung down, and heart to heart spake whispering:
<A NAME="537"></A><BR>"Verily evil-hearted Paris was,
<A NAME="538"></A><BR>Who left a leal true wife, and took for bride
<A NAME="539"></A><BR>A wanton, to himself and Troy a curse.
<A NAME="540"></A><BR>Ah fool, who recked not of the broken heart
<A NAME="541"></A><BR>Of a most virtuous wife, who more than life
<A NAME="542"></A><BR>Loved him who turned from her and loved her not!"
<A NAME="543"></A><BR><BR>So in their hearts the Nymphs spake: but they 
<A NAME="544"></A>twain
<A NAME="545"></A><BR>Burned on the pyre, never to hail again
<A NAME="546"></A><BR>The dayspring.  Wondering herdmen stood around,
<A NAME="547"></A><BR>As once the thronging Argives marvelling saw
<A NAME="548"></A><BR>Evadne clasping mid the fire her lord
<A NAME="549"></A><BR>Capaneus, slain by Zeus' dread thunderbolt.
<A NAME="550"></A><BR>But when the blast of the devouring fire
<A NAME="551"></A><BR>Had made twain one, Oenone and Paris, now
<A NAME="552"></A><BR>One little heap of ashes, then with wine
<A NAME="553"></A><BR>Quenched they the embers, and they laid their bones
<A NAME="554"></A><BR>In a wide golden vase, and round them piled
<A NAME="555"></A><BR>The earth-mound; and they set two pillars there
<A NAME="556"></A><BR>That each from other ever turn away;
<A NAME="557"></A><BR>For the old jealousy in the marble lives.
