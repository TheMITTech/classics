<A NAME="10"></A><B>How the Sons of Troy for the Last Time Fought from Her Walls and Her 
<A NAME="11"></A>Towers</B>
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="12"></A>Troy's daughters mourned within her walls; might none
<A NAME="13"></A><BR>Go forth to Paris' tomb, for far away
<A NAME="14"></A><BR>From high-built Troy it lay.  But the young men
<A NAME="15"></A><BR>Without the city toiled unceasingly
<A NAME="16"></A><BR>In fight wherein from slaughter rest was none,
<A NAME="17"></A><BR>Though dead was Paris; for the Achaeans pressed
<A NAME="18"></A><BR>Hard on the Trojans even unto Troy.
<A NAME="19"></A><BR>Yet these charged forth -- they could not choose but 
<A NAME="20"></A>so,
<A NAME="21"></A><BR>For Strife and deadly Enyo in their midst
<A NAME="22"></A><BR>Stalked, like the fell Erinyes to behold,
<A NAME="23"></A><BR>Breathing destruction from their lips like flame.
<A NAME="24"></A><BR>Beside them raged the ruthless-hearted Fates
<A NAME="25"></A><BR>Fiercely: here Panic-fear and Ares there
<A NAME="26"></A><BR>Stirred up the hosts: hard after followed
<A NAME="27"></A><BR>Dread With slaughter's gore besprent, that in one 
<A NAME="28"></A>host
<A NAME="29"></A><BR>Might men see, and be strong, in the other fear;
<A NAME="30"></A><BR>And all around were javelins, spears, and darts
<A NAME="31"></A><BR>Murder-athirst from this side, that side, showered.
<A NAME="32"></A><BR>Aye, as they hurled together, armour clashed,
<A NAME="33"></A><BR>As foe with foe grappled in murderous fight.
<A NAME="34"></A><BR><BR>There Neoptolemus slew Laodamas,
<A NAME="35"></A><BR>Whom Lycia nurtured by fair Xanthus' stream,
<A NAME="36"></A><BR>The stream revealed to men by Leto, bride
<A NAME="37"></A><BR>Of Thunderer Zeus, when Lycia's stony plain
<A NAME="38"></A><BR>Was by her hands uptorn mid agonies
<A NAME="39"></A><BR>Of travail-throes wherein she brought to light
<A NAME="40"></A><BR>Mid bitter pangs those babes of birth divine.
<A NAME="41"></A><BR>Nirus upon him laid he dead; the spear
<A NAME="42"></A><BR>Crashed through his jaw, and clear through mouth and 
<A NAME="43"></A>tongue
<A NAME="44"></A><BR>Passed: on the lance's irresistible point
<A NAME="45"></A><BR>Shrieking was he impaled: flooded with gore
<A NAME="46"></A><BR>His mouth was as he cried.  The cruel shaft,
<A NAME="47"></A><BR>Sped on by that strong hand, dashed him to earth
<A NAME="48"></A><BR>In throes of death.  Evenor next he smote
<A NAME="49"></A><BR>Above the flank, and onward drave the spear
<A NAME="50"></A><BR>Into his liver: swiftly anguished death
<A NAME="51"></A><BR>Came upon him.  Iphition next he slew:
<A NAME="52"></A><BR>He quelled Hippomedon, Hippasus' bold son,
<A NAME="53"></A><BR>Whom Ocyone the Nymph had borne beside
<A NAME="54"></A><BR>Sangarius' river-flow.  Ne'er welcomed she
<A NAME="55"></A><BR>Her son's returning face, but ruthless Fate
<A NAME="56"></A><BR>With anguish thrilled her of her child bereaved.
<A NAME="57"></A><BR><BR>Bremon Aeneas slew, and Andromachus,
<A NAME="58"></A><BR>Of Cnossus this, of hallowed Lyctus that:
<A NAME="59"></A><BR>On one spot both from their swift chariots fell;
<A NAME="60"></A><BR>This gasped for breath, his throat by the long spear
<A NAME="61"></A><BR>Transfixed; that other, by a massy stone,
<A NAME="62"></A><BR>Sped from a strong hand, on the temple struck,
<A NAME="63"></A><BR>Breathed out his life, and black doom shrouded him.
<A NAME="64"></A><BR>The startled steeds, bereft of charioteers,
<A NAME="65"></A><BR>Fleeing, mid all those corpses were confused,
<A NAME="66"></A><BR>And princely Aeneas' henchmen seized on them
<A NAME="67"></A><BR>With hearts exulting in the goodly spoil.
<A NAME="68"></A><BR><BR>There Philoctetes with his deadly shaft
<A NAME="69"></A><BR>Smote Peirasus in act to flee the war:
<A NAME="70"></A><BR>The tendons twain behind the knee it snapped,
<A NAME="71"></A><BR>And palsied all his speed.  A Danaan marked,
<A NAME="72"></A><BR>And leapt on that maimed man with sweep of sword
<A NAME="73"></A><BR>Shearing his neck through.  On the breast of earth
<A NAME="74"></A><BR>The headless body fell: the head far flung
<A NAME="75"></A><BR>Went rolling with lips parted as to shriek;
<A NAME="76"></A><BR>And swiftly fleeted thence the homeless soul.
<A NAME="77"></A><BR><BR>Polydamas struck down Eurymachus
<A NAME="78"></A><BR>And Cleon with his spear.  From Syme came
<A NAME="79"></A><BR>With Nireus' following these: cunning were both
<A NAME="80"></A><BR>In craft of fisher-folk to east the hook
<A NAME="81"></A><BR>Baited with guile, to drop into the sea
<A NAME="82"></A><BR>The net, from the boat's prow with deftest hands
<A NAME="83"></A><BR>Swiftly and straight to plunge the three-forked 
<A NAME="84"></A>spear.
<A NAME="85"></A><BR>But not from bane their sea-craft saved them now.
<A NAME="86"></A><BR><BR>Eurypylus battle-staunch laid Hellus low,
<A NAME="87"></A><BR>Whom Cleito bare beside Gygaea's mere,
<A NAME="88"></A><BR>Cleito the fair-cheeked.  Face-down in the dust
<A NAME="89"></A><BR>Outstretched he lay: shorn by the cruel sword
<A NAME="90"></A><BR>From his strong shoulder fell the arm that held
<A NAME="91"></A><BR>His long spear.  Still its muscles twitched, as 
<A NAME="92"></A>though
<A NAME="93"></A><BR>Fain to uplift the lance for fight in vain;
<A NAME="94"></A><BR>For the man's will no longer stirred therein,
<A NAME="95"></A><BR>But aimlessly it quivered, even as leaps
<A NAME="96"></A><BR>The severed tail of a snake malignant-eyed,
<A NAME="97"></A><BR>Which cannot chase the man who dealt the wound;
<A NAME="98"></A><BR>So the right hand of that strong-hearted man
<A NAME="99"></A><BR>With impotent grip still clutched the spear for 
<A NAME="100"></A>fight.
<A NAME="101"></A><BR><BR>Aenus and Polydorus Odysseus slew,
<A NAME="102"></A><BR>Ceteians both; this perished by his spear,
<A NAME="103"></A><BR>That by his sword death-dealing.  Sthenelus
<A NAME="104"></A><BR>Smote godlike Abas with a javelin-cast:
<A NAME="105"></A><BR>On through his throat and shuddering nape it rushed:
<A NAME="106"></A><BR>Stopped were his heart-beats, all his limbs collapsed.
<A NAME="107"></A><BR><BR>Tydeides slew Laodocus; Melius fell
<A NAME="108"></A><BR>By Agamemnon's hand; Deiphobus
<A NAME="109"></A><BR>Smote Alcimus and Dryas: Hippasus,
<A NAME="110"></A><BR>How war-renowned soe'er, Agenor slew
<A NAME="111"></A><BR>Far from Peneius' river.  Crushed by fate,
<A NAME="112"></A><BR>Love's nursing-debt to parents ne'er he paid.
<A NAME="113"></A><BR><BR>Lamus and stalwart Lyncus Thoas smote,
<A NAME="114"></A><BR>And Meriones slew Lycon; Menelaus
<A NAME="115"></A><BR>Laid low Archelochus.  Upon his home
<A NAME="116"></A><BR>Looked down Corycia's ridge, and that great rock
<A NAME="117"></A><BR>Of the wise Fire-god, marvellous in men's eyes;
<A NAME="118"></A><BR>For thereon, nightlong, daylong, unto him
<A NAME="119"></A><BR>Fire blazes, tireless and unquenchable.
<A NAME="120"></A><BR>Laden with fruit around it palm-trees grow,
<A NAME="121"></A><BR>While mid the stones fire plays about their roots.
<A NAME="122"></A><BR>Gods' work is this, a wonder to all time.
<A NAME="123"></A><BR><BR>By Teucer princely Hippomedon's son was slain,
<A NAME="124"></A><BR>Menoetes: as the archer drew on him,
<A NAME="125"></A><BR>Rushed he to smite him; but already hand
<A NAME="126"></A><BR>And eye, and bow-craft keen were aiming straight
<A NAME="127"></A><BR>On the arching horn the shaft.  Swiftly released
<A NAME="128"></A><BR>It leapt on the hapless man, while sang the string.
<A NAME="129"></A><BR>Stricken full front he heaved one choking gasp,
<A NAME="130"></A><BR>Because the fates on the arrow riding flew
<A NAME="131"></A><BR>Right to his heart, the throne of thought and strength
<A NAME="132"></A><BR>For men, whence short the path is unto death.
<A NAME="133"></A><BR><BR>Far from his brawny hand Euryalus hurled
<A NAME="134"></A><BR>A massy stone, and shook the ranks of Troy.
<A NAME="135"></A><BR>As when in anger against long-screaming cranes
<A NAME="136"></A><BR>A watcher of the field leaps from the ground,
<A NAME="137"></A><BR>In swift hand whirling round his head the sling,
<A NAME="138"></A><BR>And speeds the stone against them, scattering
<A NAME="139"></A><BR>Before its hum their ranks far down the wind
<A NAME="140"></A><BR>Outspread, and they in huddled panic dart
<A NAME="141"></A><BR>With wild cries this way and that, who theretofore
<A NAME="142"></A><BR>Swept on in ordered lines; so shrank the foe
<A NAME="143"></A><BR>To right and left from that dread bolt of doom
<A NAME="144"></A><BR>Hurled of Euryalus.  Not in vain it flew
<A NAME="145"></A><BR>Fate-winged; it shattered Meles' helm and head
<A NAME="146"></A><BR>Down to the eyes: so met him ghastly death.
<A NAME="147"></A><BR><BR>Still man slew man, while earth groaned all 
<A NAME="148"></A>around,
<A NAME="149"></A><BR>As when a mighty wind scourges the land,
<A NAME="150"></A><BR>And this way, that way, under its shrieking blasts
<A NAME="151"></A><BR>Through the wide woodland bow from the roots and 
<A NAME="152"></A>fall
<A NAME="153"></A><BR>Great trees, while all the earth is thundering round;
<A NAME="154"></A><BR>So fell they in the dust, so clanged their arms,
<A NAME="155"></A><BR>So crashed the earth around.  Still hot were they
<A NAME="156"></A><BR>For fell fight, still dealt bane unto their foes.
<A NAME="157"></A><BR><BR>Nigh to Aeneas then Apollo came,
<A NAME="158"></A><BR>And to Eurymachus, brave Antenor's son;
<A NAME="159"></A><BR>For these against the mighty Achaeans fought
<A NAME="160"></A><BR>Shoulder to shoulder, as two strong oxen, matched
<A NAME="161"></A><BR>In age, yoked to a wain; nor ever ceased
<A NAME="162"></A><BR>From battling.  Suddenly spake the God to these
<A NAME="163"></A><BR>In Polymestor's shape, the seer his mother
<A NAME="164"></A><BR>By Xanthus bare to the Far-darter's priest:
<A NAME="165"></A><BR>"Eurymachus, Aeneas, seed of Gods,
<A NAME="166"></A><BR>'Twere shame if ye should flinch from Argives!  Nay,
<A NAME="167"></A><BR>Not Ares' self should joy to encounter you,
<A NAME="168"></A><BR>An ye would face him in the fray; for Fate
<A NAME="169"></A><BR>Hath spun long destiny-threads for thee and thee."
<A NAME="170"></A><BR><BR>He spake, and vanished, mingling with the winds.
<A NAME="171"></A><BR>But their hearts felt the God's power: suddenly
<A NAME="172"></A><BR>Flooded with boundless courage were their frames,
<A NAME="173"></A><BR>Maddened their spirits: on the foe they leapt
<A NAME="174"></A><BR>Like furious wasps that in a storm of rage
<A NAME="175"></A><BR>Swoop upon bees, beholding them draw nigh
<A NAME="176"></A><BR>In latter-summer to the mellowing grapes,
<A NAME="177"></A><BR>Or from their hives forth-streaming thitherward;
<A NAME="178"></A><BR>So fiercely leapt these sons of Troy to meet
<A NAME="179"></A><BR>War-hardened Greeks.  The black Fates joyed to see
<A NAME="180"></A><BR>Their conflict, Ares laughed, Enyo yelled
<A NAME="181"></A><BR>Horribly.  Loud their glancing armour clanged:
<A NAME="182"></A><BR>They stabbed, they hewed down hosts of foes untold
<A NAME="183"></A><BR>With irresistible hands.  The reeling ranks
<A NAME="184"></A><BR>Fell, as the swath falls in the harvest heat,
<A NAME="185"></A><BR>When the swift-handed reapers, ranged adown
<A NAME="186"></A><BR>The field's long furrows, ply the sickle fast;
<A NAME="187"></A><BR>So fell before their hands ranks numberless:
<A NAME="188"></A><BR>With corpses earth was heaped, with torrent blood
<A NAME="189"></A><BR>Was streaming: Strife incarnate o'er the slain
<A NAME="190"></A><BR>Gloated.  They paused not from the awful toil,
<A NAME="191"></A><BR>But aye pressed on, like lions chasing sheep.
<A NAME="192"></A><BR>Then turned the Greeks to craven flight; all feet
<A NAME="193"></A><BR>Unmaimed as yet fled from the murderous war.
<A NAME="194"></A><BR>Aye followed on Anchises' warrior son,
<A NAME="195"></A><BR>Smiting foes' backs with his avenging spear:
<A NAME="196"></A><BR>On pressed Eurymachus, while glowed the heart
<A NAME="197"></A><BR>Of Healer Apollo watching from on high.
<A NAME="198"></A><BR><BR>As when a man descries a herd of swine
<A NAME="199"></A><BR>Draw nigh his ripening corn, before the sheaves
<A NAME="200"></A><BR>Fall neath the reapers' hands, and harketh on
<A NAME="201"></A><BR>Against them his strong dogs; as down they rush,
<A NAME="202"></A><BR>The spoilers see and quake; no more think they
<A NAME="203"></A><BR>Of feasting, but they turn in panic flight
<A NAME="204"></A><BR>Huddling: fast follow at their heels the hounds
<A NAME="205"></A><BR>Biting remorselessly, while long and loud
<A NAME="206"></A><BR>Squealing they flee, and joys the harvest's lord;
<A NAME="207"></A><BR>So rejoiced Phoebus, seeing from the war
<A NAME="208"></A><BR>Fleeing the mighty Argive host.  No more
<A NAME="209"></A><BR>Cared they for deeds of men, but cried to the Gods
<A NAME="210"></A><BR>For swift feet, in whose feet alone was hope
<A NAME="211"></A><BR>To escape Eurymachus' and Aeneas' spears
<A NAME="212"></A><BR>Which lightened ever all along their rear.
<A NAME="213"></A><BR><BR>But one Greek, over-trusting in his strength,
<A NAME="214"></A><BR>Or by Fate's malice to destruction drawn,
<A NAME="215"></A><BR>Curbed in mid flight from war's turmoil his steed,
<A NAME="216"></A><BR>And strove to wheel him round into the fight
<A NAME="217"></A><BR>To face the foe.  But fierce Agenor thrust
<A NAME="218"></A><BR>Ere he was ware; his two-edged partizan
<A NAME="219"></A><BR>Shore though his shoulder; yea, the very bone
<A NAME="220"></A><BR>Of that gashed arm was cloven by the steel;
<A NAME="221"></A><BR>The tendons parted, the veins spirted blood:
<A NAME="222"></A><BR>Down by his horse's neck he slid, and straight
<A NAME="223"></A><BR>Fell mid the dead.  But still the strong arm hung
<A NAME="224"></A><BR>With rigid fingers locked about the reins
<A NAME="225"></A><BR>Like a live man's.  Weird marvel was that sight,
<A NAME="226"></A><BR>The bloody hand down hanging from the rein,
<A NAME="227"></A><BR>Scaring the foes yet more, by Ares' will.
<A NAME="228"></A><BR>Thou hadst said, "It craveth still for horsemanship!"
<A NAME="229"></A><BR>So bare the steed that sign of his slain lord.
<A NAME="230"></A><BR><BR>Aeneas hurled his spear; it found the waist
<A NAME="231"></A><BR>Of Anthalus' son, it pierced the navel through,
<A NAME="232"></A><BR>Dragging the inwards with it.  Stretched in dust,
<A NAME="233"></A><BR>Clutching with agonized hands at steel and bowels,
<A NAME="234"></A><BR>Horribly shrieked he, tore with his teeth the earth
<A NAME="235"></A><BR>Groaning, till life and pain forsook the man.
<A NAME="236"></A><BR>Scared were the Argives, like a startled team
<A NAME="237"></A><BR>Of oxen 'neath the yoke-band straining hard,
<A NAME="238"></A><BR>What time the sharp-fanged gadfly stings their flanks
<A NAME="239"></A><BR>Athirst for blood, and they in frenzy of pain
<A NAME="240"></A><BR>Start from the furrow, and sore disquieted
<A NAME="241"></A><BR>The hind is for marred work, and for their sake,
<A NAME="242"></A><BR>Lest haply the recoiling ploughshare light
<A NAME="243"></A><BR>On their leg-sinews, and hamstring his team;
<A NAME="244"></A><BR>So were the Danaans scared, so feared for them
<A NAME="245"></A><BR>Achilles' son, and shouted thunder-voiced:
<A NAME="246"></A><BR>"Cravens, why flee, like starlings nothing-worth
<A NAME="247"></A><BR>Scared by a hawk that swoopeth down on them?
<A NAME="248"></A><BR>Come, play the men!  Better it is by far
<A NAME="249"></A><BR>To die in war than choose unmanly flight!"
<A NAME="250"></A><BR><BR>Then to his cry they hearkened, and straightway
<A NAME="251"></A><BR>Were of good heart.  Mighty of mood he leapt
<A NAME="252"></A><BR>Upon the Trojans, swinging in his hand
<A NAME="253"></A><BR>The lightening spear: swept after him his host
<A NAME="254"></A><BR>Of Myrmidons with hearts swelled with the strength
<A NAME="255"></A><BR>Resistless of a tempest; so the Greeks
<A NAME="256"></A><BR>Won breathing-space.  With fury like his sire's
<A NAME="257"></A><BR>One after other slew he of the foe.
<A NAME="258"></A><BR>Recoiling back they fell, as waves on-rolled
<A NAME="259"></A><BR>By Boreas foaming from the deep to the strand,
<A NAME="260"></A><BR>Are caught by another blast that whirlwind-like
<A NAME="261"></A><BR>Leaps, in a short lull of the north-wind, forth,
<A NAME="262"></A><BR>Smites them full-face, and hurls them back from the 
<A NAME="263"></A>shore;
<A NAME="264"></A><BR>So them that erewhile on the Danaans pressed
<A NAME="265"></A><BR>Godlike Achilles' son now backward hurled
<A NAME="266"></A><BR>A short space only brave Aeneas' spirit
<A NAME="267"></A><BR>Let him not flee, but made him bide the fight
<A NAME="268"></A><BR>Fearlessly; and Enyo level held
<A NAME="269"></A><BR>The battle's scales.  Yet not against Aeneas
<A NAME="270"></A><BR>Achilles' son upraised his father's spear,
<A NAME="271"></A><BR>But elsewhither turned his fury: in reverence
<A NAME="272"></A><BR>For Aphrodite, Thetis splendour-veiled
<A NAME="273"></A><BR>Turned from that man her mighty son's son's rage
<A NAME="274"></A><BR>And giant strength on other hosts of foes.
<A NAME="275"></A><BR>There slew he many a Trojan, while the ranks
<A NAME="276"></A><BR>Of Greeks were ravaged by Aeneas' hand.
<A NAME="277"></A><BR>Over the battle-slain the vultures joyed,
<A NAME="278"></A><BR>Hungry to rend the hearts and flesh of men.
<A NAME="279"></A><BR>But all the Nymphs were wailing, daughters born
<A NAME="280"></A><BR>Of Xanthus and fair-flowing Simois.
<A NAME="281"></A><BR><BR>So toiled they in the fight: the wind's breath 
<A NAME="282"></A>rolled
<A NAME="283"></A><BR>Huge dust-clouds up; the illimitable air
<A NAME="284"></A><BR>Was one thick haze, as with a sudden mist:
<A NAME="285"></A><BR>Earth disappeared, faces were blotted out;
<A NAME="286"></A><BR>Yet still they fought on; each man, whomso he met,
<A NAME="287"></A><BR>Ruthlessly slew him, though his very friend
<A NAME="288"></A><BR>It might be -- in that turmoil none could tell
<A NAME="289"></A><BR>Who met him, friend or foe: blind wilderment
<A NAME="290"></A><BR>Enmeshed the hosts.  And now had all been blent
<A NAME="291"></A><BR>Confusedly, had perished miserably,
<A NAME="292"></A><BR>All falling by their fellows' murderous swords,
<A NAME="293"></A><BR>Had not Cronion from Olympus helped
<A NAME="294"></A><BR>Their sore strait, and he swept aside the dust
<A NAME="295"></A><BR>Of conflict, and he calmed those deadly winds.
<A NAME="296"></A><BR>Yet still the hosts fought on; but lighter far
<A NAME="297"></A><BR>Their battle-travail was, who now discerned
<A NAME="298"></A><BR>Whom in the fray to smite, and whom to spare.
<A NAME="299"></A><BR>The Danaans now forced back the Trojan host,
<A NAME="300"></A><BR>The Trojans now the Danaan ranks, as swayed
<A NAME="301"></A><BR>The dread fight to and fro.  From either side
<A NAME="302"></A><BR>Darts leapt and fell like snowflakes.  Far away
<A NAME="303"></A><BR>Shepherds from Ida trembling watched the strife,
<A NAME="304"></A><BR>And to the Heaven-abiders lifted hands
<A NAME="305"></A><BR>Of supplication, praying that all their foes
<A NAME="306"></A><BR>Might perish, and that from the woeful war
<A NAME="307"></A><BR>Troy might win breathing-space, and see at last
<A NAME="308"></A><BR>The day of freedom: the Gods hearkened not.
<A NAME="309"></A><BR>Far other issues Fate devised, nor recked
<A NAME="310"></A><BR>Of Zeus the Almighty, nor of none beside
<A NAME="311"></A><BR>Of the Immortals.  Her unpitying soul
<A NAME="312"></A><BR>Cares naught what doom she spinneth with her thread
<A NAME="313"></A><BR>Inevitable, be it for men new-born
<A NAME="314"></A><BR>Or cities: all things wax and wane through her.
<A NAME="315"></A><BR>So by her hest the battle-travail swelled
<A NAME="316"></A><BR>'Twixt Trojan chariot-lords and Greeks that closed
<A NAME="317"></A><BR>In grapple of fight -- they dealt each other death
<A NAME="318"></A><BR>Ruthlessly: no man quailed, but stout of heart
<A NAME="319"></A><BR>Fought on; for courage thrusts men into war.
<A NAME="320"></A><BR><BR>But now when many had perished in the dust,
<A NAME="321"></A><BR>Then did the Argive might prevail at last
<A NAME="322"></A><BR>By stern decree of Pallas; for she came
<A NAME="323"></A><BR>Into the heart of battle, hot to help
<A NAME="324"></A><BR>The Greeks to lay waste Priam's glorious town.
<A NAME="325"></A><BR>Then Aphrodite, who lamented sore
<A NAME="326"></A><BR>For Paris slain, snatched suddenly away
<A NAME="327"></A><BR>Renowned Aeneas from the deadly strife,
<A NAME="328"></A><BR>And poured thick mist about him.  Fate forbade
<A NAME="329"></A><BR>That hero any longer to contend
<A NAME="330"></A><BR>With Argive foes without the high-built wall.
<A NAME="331"></A><BR>Yea, and his mother sorely feared the wrath
<A NAME="332"></A><BR>Of Pallas passing-wise, whose heart was keen
<A NAME="333"></A><BR>To help the Danaans now -- yea, feared lest she
<A NAME="334"></A><BR>Might slay him even beyond his doom, who spared
<A NAME="335"></A><BR>Not Ares' self, a mightier far than he.
<A NAME="336"></A><BR><BR>No more the Trojans now abode the edge
<A NAME="337"></A><BR>Of fight, but all disheartened backward drew.
<A NAME="338"></A><BR>For like fierce ravening beasts the Argive men
<A NAME="339"></A><BR>Leapt on them, mad with murderous rage of war.
<A NAME="340"></A><BR>Choked with their slain the river-channels were,
<A NAME="341"></A><BR>Heaped was the field; in red dust thousands fell,
<A NAME="342"></A><BR>Horses and men; and chariots overturned
<A NAME="343"></A><BR>Were strewn there: blood was streaming all around
<A NAME="344"></A><BR>Like rain, for deadly Doom raged through the fray.
<A NAME="345"></A><BR><BR>Men stabbed with swords, and men impaled on 
<A NAME="346"></A>spears
<A NAME="347"></A><BR>Lay all confusedly, like scattered beams,
<A NAME="348"></A><BR>When on the strand of the low-thundering sea
<A NAME="349"></A><BR>Men from great girders of a tall ship's hull
<A NAME="350"></A><BR>Strike out the bolts and clamps, and scatter wide
<A NAME="351"></A><BR>Long planks and timbers, till the whole broad beach
<A NAME="352"></A><BR>Is paved with beams o'erplashed by darkling surge;
<A NAME="353"></A><BR>So lay in dust and blood those slaughtered men,
<A NAME="354"></A><BR>Rapture and pain of fight forgotten now.
<A NAME="355"></A><BR><BR>A remnant from the pitiless strife escaped
<A NAME="356"></A><BR>Entered their stronghold, scarce eluding doom.
<A NAME="357"></A><BR>Children and wives from their limbs blood-besprent
<A NAME="358"></A><BR>Received their arms bedabbled with foul gore;
<A NAME="359"></A><BR>And baths for all were heated.  Leeches ran
<A NAME="360"></A><BR>Through all the town in hot haste to the homes
<A NAME="361"></A><BR>Of wounded men to minister to their hurts.
<A NAME="362"></A><BR>Here wives and daughters moaned round men come back
<A NAME="363"></A><BR>From war, there cried on many who came not
<A NAME="364"></A><BR>Here, men stung to the soul by bitter pangs
<A NAME="365"></A><BR>Groaned upon beds of pain; there, toil-spent men
<A NAME="366"></A><BR>Turned them to supper.  Whinnied the swift steeds
<A NAME="367"></A><BR>And neighed o'er mangers heaped.  By tent and ship
<A NAME="368"></A><BR>Far off the Greeks did even as they of Troy.
<A NAME="369"></A><BR><BR>When o'er the streams of Ocean Dawn drove up
<A NAME="370"></A><BR>Her splendour-flashing steeds, and earth's tribes 
<A NAME="371"></A>waked,
<A NAME="372"></A><BR>Then the strong Argives' battle-eager sons
<A NAME="373"></A><BR>Marched against Priam's city lofty-towered,
<A NAME="374"></A><BR>Save some that mid the tents by wounded men
<A NAME="375"></A><BR>Tarried, lest haply raiders on the ships
<A NAME="376"></A><BR>Might fall, to help the Trojans, while these fought
<A NAME="377"></A><BR>The foe from towers, while rose the flame of war.
<A NAME="378"></A><BR><BR>Before the Scaean gate fought Capaneus' son
<A NAME="379"></A><BR>And godlike Diomedes.  High above
<A NAME="380"></A><BR>Deiphobus battle-staunch and strong Polites
<A NAME="381"></A><BR>With many comrades, stoutly held them back
<A NAME="382"></A><BR>With arrows and huge stones.  Clanged evermore
<A NAME="383"></A><BR>The smitten helms and shields that fenced strong 
<A NAME="384"></A>men
<A NAME="385"></A><BR>From bitter doom and unrelenting fate,
<A NAME="386"></A><BR><BR>Before the Gate Idaean Achilles' son
<A NAME="387"></A><BR>Set in array the fight: around him toiled
<A NAME="388"></A><BR>His host of battle-cunning Myrmidons.
<A NAME="389"></A><BR>Helenus and Agenor gallant-souled,
<A NAME="390"></A><BR>Down-hailing darts, against them held the wall,
<A NAME="391"></A><BR>Aye cheering on their men.  No spurring these
<A NAME="392"></A><BR>Needed to fight hard for their country's walls.
<A NAME="393"></A><BR><BR>Odysseus and Eurypylus made assault
<A NAME="394"></A><BR>Unresting on the gates that fated the plain
<A NAME="395"></A><BR>And looked to the swift ships.  From wall and tower
<A NAME="396"></A><BR>With huge stones brave Aeneas made defence.
<A NAME="397"></A><BR><BR>In battle-stress by Simons Teucer toiled.
<A NAME="398"></A><BR>Each endured hardness at his several post.
<A NAME="399"></A><BR><BR>Then round war-wise Odysseus men renowned,
<A NAME="400"></A><BR>By that great captain's battle cunning ruled,
<A NAME="401"></A><BR>Locked shields together, raised them o'er their 
<A NAME="402"></A>heads
<A NAME="403"></A><BR>Ranged side by side, that many were made one.
<A NAME="404"></A><BR>Thou hadst said it was a great hall's solid roof,
<A NAME="405"></A><BR>Which no tempestuous wind-blast misty wet
<A NAME="406"></A><BR>Can pierce, nor rain from heaven in torrents poured.
<A NAME="407"></A><BR>So fenced about with shields firm stood the ranks
<A NAME="408"></A><BR>Of Argives, one in heart for fight, and one
<A NAME="409"></A><BR>In that array close-welded.  From above
<A NAME="410"></A><BR>The Trojans hailed great stones; as from a rock
<A NAME="411"></A><BR>Rolled these to earth.  Full many a spear and dart
<A NAME="412"></A><BR>And galling javelin in the pierced shields stood;
<A NAME="413"></A><BR>Some in the earth stood; many glanced away
<A NAME="414"></A><BR>With bent points falling baffled from the shields
<A NAME="415"></A><BR>Battered on all sides.  But that clangorous din
<A NAME="416"></A><BR>None feared; none flinched; as pattering drops of 
<A NAME="417"></A>rain
<A NAME="418"></A><BR>They heard it.  Up to the rampart's foot they marched:
<A NAME="419"></A><BR>None hung back; shoulder to shoulder on they came
<A NAME="420"></A><BR>Like a long lurid cloud that o'er the sky
<A NAME="421"></A><BR>Cronion trails in wild midwinter-tide.
<A NAME="422"></A><BR>On that battalion moved, with thunderous tread
<A NAME="423"></A><BR>Of tramping feet: a little above the earth
<A NAME="424"></A><BR>Rose up the dust; the breeze swept it aside
<A NAME="425"></A><BR>Drifting away behind the men.  There went
<A NAME="426"></A><BR>A sound confused of voices with them, like
<A NAME="427"></A><BR>The hum of bees that murmur round the hives,
<A NAME="428"></A><BR>And multitudinous panting, and the gasp
<A NAME="429"></A><BR>Of men hard-breathing.  Exceeding glad the sons
<A NAME="430"></A><BR>Of Atreus, glorying in them, saw that wall
<A NAME="431"></A><BR>Unwavering of doom-denouncing war.
<A NAME="432"></A><BR>In one dense mass against the city-gate
<A NAME="433"></A><BR>They hurled themselves, with twibills strove to 
<A NAME="434"></A>breach
<A NAME="435"></A><BR>The long walls, from their hinges to upheave
<A NAME="436"></A><BR>The gates, and dash to earth.  The pulse of hope
<A NAME="437"></A><BR>Beat strong in those proud hearts.  But naught availed
<A NAME="438"></A><BR>Targes nor levers, when Aeneas' might
<A NAME="439"></A><BR>Swung in his hands a stone like a thunderbolt,
<A NAME="440"></A><BR>Hurled it with uttermost strength, and dashed to 
<A NAME="441"></A>death
<A NAME="442"></A><BR>All whom it caught beneath the shields, as when
<A NAME="443"></A><BR>A mountain's precipice-edge breaks off and falls
<A NAME="444"></A><BR>On pasturing goats, and all that graze thereby
<A NAME="445"></A><BR>Tremble; so were those Danaans dazed with dread.
<A NAME="446"></A><BR>Stone after stone he hurled on the reeling ranks,
<A NAME="447"></A><BR>As when amid the hills Olympian Zeus
<A NAME="448"></A><BR>With thunderbolts and blazing lightnings rends
<A NAME="449"></A><BR>From their foundations crags that rim a peak,
<A NAME="450"></A><BR>And this way, that way, sends them hurtling down;
<A NAME="451"></A><BR>Then the flocks tremble, scattering in wild flight;
<A NAME="452"></A><BR>So quailed the Achaeans, when Aeneas dashed
<A NAME="453"></A><BR>To sudden fragments all that battle-wall
<A NAME="454"></A><BR>Moulded of adamant shields, because a God
<A NAME="455"></A><BR>Gave more than human strength.  No man of them
<A NAME="456"></A><BR>Could lift his eyes unto him in that fight,
<A NAME="457"></A><BR>Because the arms that lapped his sinewy limbs
<A NAME="458"></A><BR>Flashed like the heaven-born lightnings.  At his 
<A NAME="459"></A>side
<A NAME="460"></A><BR>Stood, all his form divine in darkness cloaked,
<A NAME="461"></A><BR>Ares the terrible, and winged the flight
<A NAME="462"></A><BR>Of what bare down to the Argives doom or dread.
<A NAME="463"></A><BR>He fought as when Olympian Zeus himself
<A NAME="464"></A><BR>From heaven in wrath smote down the insolent bands
<A NAME="465"></A><BR>Of giants grim, and shook the boundless earth,
<A NAME="466"></A><BR>And sea, and ocean, and the heavens, when reeled
<A NAME="467"></A><BR>The knees of Atlas neath the rush of Zeus.
<A NAME="468"></A><BR>So crumbled down beneath Aeneas' bolts
<A NAME="469"></A><BR>The Argive squadrons.  All along the wall
<A NAME="470"></A><BR>Wroth with the foeman rushed he: from his hands
<A NAME="471"></A><BR>Whatso he lighted on in onslaught-haste
<A NAME="472"></A><BR>Hurled he; for many a battle-staying bolt
<A NAME="473"></A><BR>Lay on the walls of those staunch Dardan men.
<A NAME="474"></A><BR>With such Aeneas stormed in giant might,
<A NAME="475"></A><BR>With such drave back the thronging foes.  All round
<A NAME="476"></A><BR>The Trojans played the men.  Sore travail and pain
<A NAME="477"></A><BR>Had all folk round the city: many fell,
<A NAME="478"></A><BR>Argives and Trojans.  Rang the battle-cries:
<A NAME="479"></A><BR>Aeneas cheered the war-fain Trojans on
<A NAME="480"></A><BR>To fight for home, for wives, and their own souls
<A NAME="481"></A><BR>With a good heart: war-staunch Achilles' son
<A NAME="482"></A><BR>Shouted: "Flinch not, ye Argives, from the walls,
<A NAME="483"></A><BR>Till Troy be taken, and sink down in flames!"
<A NAME="484"></A><BR>And round these twain an awful measureless roar
<A NAME="485"></A><BR>Rang, daylong as they fought: no breathing-space
<A NAME="486"></A><BR>Came from the war to them whose spirits burned,
<A NAME="487"></A><BR>These, to smite Ilium, those, to guard her safe.
<A NAME="488"></A><BR><BR>But from Aeneas valiant-souled afar
<A NAME="489"></A><BR>Fought Aias, speeding midst the men of Troy
<A NAME="490"></A><BR>Winged death; for now his arrow straight through 
<A NAME="491"></A>air
<A NAME="492"></A><BR>Flew, now his deadly dart, and smote them down
<A NAME="493"></A><BR>One after one: yet others cowered away
<A NAME="494"></A><BR>Before his peerless prowess, and abode
<A NAME="495"></A><BR>The fight no more, but fenceless left the wall
<A NAME="496"></A><BR><BR>Then one, of all the Locrians mightiest,
<A NAME="497"></A><BR>Fierce-souled Alcimedon, trusting in his prince
<A NAME="498"></A><BR>And his own might and valour of his youth,
<A NAME="499"></A><BR>All battle-eager on a ladder set
<A NAME="500"></A><BR>Swift feet, to pave for friends a death-strewn path
<A NAME="501"></A><BR>Into the town.  Above his head he raised
<A NAME="502"></A><BR><BR>The screening shield; up that dread path he 
<A NAME="503"></A>went
<A NAME="504"></A><BR>Hardening his heart from trembling, in his hand
<A NAME="505"></A><BR>Now shook the threatening spear, now upward climbed 
<A NAME="506"></A>\u00fa
<A NAME="507"></A><BR>Fast high in air he trod the perilous way.
<A NAME="508"></A><BR>Now on the Trojans had disaster come,
<A NAME="509"></A><BR>But, even as above the parapet
<A NAME="510"></A><BR>His head rose, and for the first time and the last
<A NAME="511"></A><BR>From her high rampart he looked down on Troy,
<A NAME="512"></A><BR>Aeneas, who had marked, albeit afar,
<A NAME="513"></A><BR>That bold assault, rushed on him, dashed on his 
<A NAME="514"></A>head
<A NAME="515"></A><BR>So huge a stone that the hero's mighty strength
<A NAME="516"></A><BR>Shattered the ladder.  Down from on high he rushed
<A NAME="517"></A><BR>As arrow from the string: death followed him
<A NAME="518"></A><BR>As whirling round he fell; with air was blent
<A NAME="519"></A><BR>His lost life, ere he crashed to the stony ground.
<A NAME="520"></A><BR>Strong spear, broad shield, in mid fall flew from his 
<A NAME="521"></A>hands,
<A NAME="522"></A><BR>And from his head the helm: his corslet came
<A NAME="523"></A><BR>Alone with him to earth.  The Locrian men
<A NAME="524"></A><BR>Groaned, seeing their champion quelled by evil doom;
<A NAME="525"></A><BR>For all his hair and all the stones around
<A NAME="526"></A><BR>Were brain-bespattered: all his bones were crushed,
<A NAME="527"></A><BR>And his once active limbs besprent with gore.
<A NAME="528"></A><BR><BR>Then godlike Poeas' war-triumphant son
<A NAME="529"></A><BR>Marked where Aeneas stormed along the wall
<A NAME="530"></A><BR>In lion-like strength, and straightway shot a shaft
<A NAME="531"></A><BR>Aimed at that glorious hero, neither missed
<A NAME="532"></A><BR>The man: yet not through his unyielding targe
<A NAME="533"></A><BR>To the fair flesh it won, being turned aside
<A NAME="534"></A><BR>By Cytherea and the shield, but grazed
<A NAME="535"></A><BR>The buckler lightly: yet not all in vain
<A NAME="536"></A><BR>Fell earthward, but between the targe and helm
<A NAME="537"></A><BR>Smote Medon: from the tower he fell, as falls
<A NAME="538"></A><BR>A wild goat from a crag, the hunter's shaft
<A NAME="539"></A><BR>Deep in its heart: so nerveless-flung he fell,
<A NAME="540"></A><BR>And fled away from him the precious life.
<A NAME="541"></A><BR>Wroth for his friend, a stone Aeneas hurled,
<A NAME="542"></A><BR>And Philoctetes' stalwart comrade slew,
<A NAME="543"></A><BR>Toxaechmes; for he shattered his head and crushed
<A NAME="544"></A><BR>Helmet and skull-bones; and his noble heart
<A NAME="545"></A><BR>Was stilled.  Loud shouted princely Poeas' son:
<A NAME="546"></A><BR>"Aeneas, thou, forsooth, dost deem thyself
<A NAME="547"></A><BR>A mighty champion, fighting from a tower
<A NAME="548"></A><BR>Whence craven women war with foes!  Now if
<A NAME="549"></A><BR>Thou be a man, come forth without the wall
<A NAME="550"></A><BR>In battle-harness, and so learn to know
<A NAME="551"></A><BR>In spear-craft and in bow-craft Poeas' son!"
<A NAME="552"></A><BR><BR>So cried he; but Anchises' valiant seed,
<A NAME="553"></A><BR>How fain soe'er, naught answered, for the stress
<A NAME="554"></A><BR>Of desperate conflict round that wall and burg
<A NAME="555"></A><BR>Ceaselessly raging: pause from fight was none:
<A NAME="556"></A><BR>Yea, for long time no respite had there been
<A NAME="557"></A><BR>For the war-weary from that endless toil.
