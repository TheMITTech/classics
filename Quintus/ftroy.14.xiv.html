<A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A><B>How the Conquerors Sailed from Troy Unto Judgment of Tempest and 
<A NAME="11"></A>Shipwreck</B>
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="12"></A>Then rose from Ocean Dawn the golden-throned
<A NAME="13"></A><BR>Up to the heavens; night into Chaos sank.
<A NAME="14"></A><BR>And now the Argives spoiled fair-fenced Troy,
<A NAME="15"></A><BR>And took her boundless treasures for a prey.
<A NAME="16"></A><BR>Like river-torrents seemed they, that sweep down,
<A NAME="17"></A><BR>By rain, floods swelled, in thunder from the hills,
<A NAME="18"></A><BR>And seaward hurl tall trees and whatsoe'er
<A NAME="19"></A><BR>Grows on the mountains, mingled with the wreck
<A NAME="20"></A><BR>Of shattered cliff and crag; so the long lines
<A NAME="21"></A><BR>Of Danaans who had wasted Troy with fire
<A NAME="22"></A><BR>Seemed, streaming with her plunder to the ships.
<A NAME="23"></A><BR>Troy's daughters therewithal in scattered bands
<A NAME="24"></A><BR>They haled down seaward -- virgins yet unwed,
<A NAME="25"></A><BR>And new-made brides, and matrons silver-haired,
<A NAME="26"></A><BR>And mothers from whose bosoms foes had torn
<A NAME="27"></A><BR>Babes for the last time closing lips on breasts.
<A NAME="28"></A><BR><BR>Amidst of these Menelaus led his wife
<A NAME="29"></A><BR>Forth of the burning city, having wrought
<A NAME="30"></A><BR>A mighty triumph -- joy and shame were his.
<A NAME="31"></A><BR>Cassandra heavenly-fair was haled the prize
<A NAME="32"></A><BR>Of Agamemnon: to Achilles' son
<A NAME="33"></A><BR>Andromache had fallen: Hecuba
<A NAME="34"></A><BR>Odysseus dragged unto his ship.  The tears
<A NAME="35"></A><BR>Poured from her eyes as water from a spring;
<A NAME="36"></A><BR>Trembled her limbs, fear-frenzied was her heart;
<A NAME="37"></A><BR>Rent were her hoary tresses and besprent
<A NAME="38"></A><BR>With ashes of the hearth, cast by her hands
<A NAME="39"></A><BR>When she saw Priam slain and Troy aflame.
<A NAME="40"></A><BR>And aye she deeply groaned for thraldom's day
<A NAME="41"></A><BR>That trapped her vainly loth.  Each hero led
<A NAME="42"></A><BR>A wailing Trojan woman to his ship.
<A NAME="43"></A><BR>Here, there, uprose from these the wild lament,
<A NAME="44"></A><BR>The woeful-mingling cries of mother and babe.
<A NAME="45"></A><BR>As when with white-tusked swine the herdmen drive
<A NAME="46"></A><BR>Their younglings from the hill-pens to the plain
<A NAME="47"></A><BR>As winter closeth in, and evermore
<A NAME="48"></A><BR>Each answereth each with mingled plaintive cries;
<A NAME="49"></A><BR>So moaned Troy's daughters by their foes enslaved,
<A NAME="50"></A><BR>Handmaid and queen made one in thraldom's lot.
<A NAME="51"></A><BR><BR>But Helen raised no lamentation: shame
<A NAME="52"></A><BR>Sat on her dark-blue eyes, and cast its flush
<A NAME="53"></A><BR>Over her lovely cheeks.  Her heart beat hard
<A NAME="54"></A><BR>With sore misgiving, lest, as to the ships
<A NAME="55"></A><BR>She passed, the Achaeans might mishandle her.
<A NAME="56"></A><BR>Therefore with fluttering soul she trembled sore;
<A NAME="57"></A><BR>And, her head darkly mantled in her veil,
<A NAME="58"></A><BR>Close-following trod she in her husband's steps,
<A NAME="59"></A><BR>With cheek shame-crimsoned, like the Queen of Love,
<A NAME="60"></A><BR>What time the Heaven-abiders saw her clasped
<A NAME="61"></A><BR>In Ares' arms, shaming in sight of all
<A NAME="62"></A><BR>The marriage-bed, trapped in the myriad-meshed
<A NAME="63"></A><BR>Toils of Hephaestus: tangled there she lay
<A NAME="64"></A><BR>In agony of shame, while thronged around
<A NAME="65"></A><BR>The Blessed, and there stood Hephaestus' self:
<A NAME="66"></A><BR>For fearful it is for wives to be beheld
<A NAME="67"></A><BR>By husbands' eyes doing the deed of shame.
<A NAME="68"></A><BR>Lovely as she in form and roseate blush
<A NAME="69"></A><BR>Passed Helen mid the Trojan captives on
<A NAME="70"></A><BR>To the Argive ships.  But the folk all around
<A NAME="71"></A><BR>Marvelled to see the glory of loveliness
<A NAME="72"></A><BR>Of that all-flawless woman.  No man dared
<A NAME="73"></A><BR>Or secretly or openly to cast
<A NAME="74"></A><BR>Reproach on her.  As on a Goddess all
<A NAME="75"></A><BR>Gazed on her with adoring wistful eyes.
<A NAME="76"></A><BR>As when to wanderers on a stormy sea,
<A NAME="77"></A><BR>After long time and passion of prayer, the sight
<A NAME="78"></A><BR>Of fatherland is given; from deadly deeps
<A NAME="79"></A><BR>Escaped, they stretch hands to her joyful-souled;
<A NAME="80"></A><BR>So joyed the Danaans all, no man of them
<A NAME="81"></A><BR>Remembered any more war's travail and pain.
<A NAME="82"></A><BR>Such thoughts Cytherea stirred in them, for grace
<A NAME="83"></A><BR>To Helen starry-eyed, and Zeus her sire.
<A NAME="84"></A><BR><BR>Then, when he saw that burg beloved destroyed,
<A NAME="85"></A><BR>Xanthus, scarce drawing breath from bloody war,
<A NAME="86"></A><BR>Mourned with his Nymphs for ruin fallen on Troy,
<A NAME="87"></A><BR>Mourned for the city of Priam blotted out.
<A NAME="88"></A><BR>As when hail lashes a field of ripened wheat,
<A NAME="89"></A><BR>And beats it small, and smites off all the ears
<A NAME="90"></A><BR>With merciless scourge, and levelled with the ground
<A NAME="91"></A><BR>Are stalks, and on the earth is all the grain
<A NAME="92"></A><BR>Woefully wasted, and the harvest's lord
<A NAME="93"></A><BR>Is stricken with deadly grief; so Xanthus' soul
<A NAME="94"></A><BR>Was utterly whelmed in grief for Ilium made
<A NAME="95"></A><BR>A desolation; grief undying was his,
<A NAME="96"></A><BR>Immortal though he was.  Mourned Simois
<A NAME="97"></A><BR>And long-ridged Ida: all who on Ida dwelt
<A NAME="98"></A><BR>Wailed from afar the ruin of Priam's town.
<A NAME="99"></A><BR><BR>But with loud laughter of glee the Argives sought
<A NAME="100"></A><BR>Their galleys, chanting the triumphant might
<A NAME="101"></A><BR>Of victory, chanting now the Blessed Gods,
<A NAME="102"></A><BR>Now their own valour, and Epeius' work
<A NAME="103"></A><BR>Ever renowned.  Their song soared up to heaven,
<A NAME="104"></A><BR>Like multitudinous cries of daws, when breaks
<A NAME="105"></A><BR>A day of sunny calm and windless air
<A NAME="106"></A><BR>After a ruining storm: from their glad hearts
<A NAME="107"></A><BR>So rose the joyful clamour, till the Gods
<A NAME="108"></A><BR>Heard and rejoiced in heaven, all who had helped
<A NAME="109"></A><BR>With willing hands the war-fain Argive men.
<A NAME="110"></A><BR>But chafed those others which had aided Troy,
<A NAME="111"></A><BR>Beholding Priam's city wrapped in flame,
<A NAME="112"></A><BR>Yet powerless for her help to override
<A NAME="113"></A><BR>Fate; for not Cronos' Son can stay the hand
<A NAME="114"></A><BR>Of Destiny, whose might transcendeth all
<A NAME="115"></A><BR>The Immortals, and Zeus sanctioneth all her deeds.
<A NAME="116"></A><BR><BR>The Argives on the flaming altar-wood
<A NAME="117"></A><BR>Laid many thighs of oxen, and made haste
<A NAME="118"></A><BR>To spill sweet wine on their burnt offerings,
<A NAME="119"></A><BR>Thanking the Gods for that great work achieved.
<A NAME="120"></A><BR>And loudly at the feast they sang the praise
<A NAME="121"></A><BR>Of all the mailed men whom the Horse of Tree
<A NAME="122"></A><BR>Had ambushed.  Far-famed Sinon they extolled
<A NAME="123"></A><BR>For that dire torment he endured of foes;
<A NAME="124"></A><BR>Yea, song and honour-guerdons without end
<A NAME="125"></A><BR>All rendered him: and that resolved soul
<A NAME="126"></A><BR>Glad-hearted joyed for the Argives victory,
<A NAME="127"></A><BR>And for his own misfeaturing sorrowed not.
<A NAME="128"></A><BR>For to the wise and prudent man renown
<A NAME="129"></A><BR>Is better far than gold, than goodlihead,
<A NAME="130"></A><BR>Than all good things men have or hope to win.
<A NAME="131"></A><BR><BR>So, feasting by the ships all void of fear,
<A NAME="132"></A><BR>Cried one to another ever and anon:
<A NAME="133"></A><BR>"We have touched the goal of this long war, have 
<A NAME="134"></A>won
<A NAME="135"></A><BR>Glory, have smitten our foes and their great town!
<A NAME="136"></A><BR>Now grant, O Zeus, to our prayers safe home-return!"
<A NAME="137"></A><BR>But not to all the Sire vouchsafed return.
<A NAME="138"></A><BR><BR>Then rose a cunning harper in their midst.
<A NAME="139"></A><BR>And sang the song of triumph and of peace
<A NAME="140"></A><BR>Re-won, and with glad hearts untouched by care
<A NAME="141"></A><BR>They heard; for no more fear of war had they,
<A NAME="142"></A><BR>But of sweet toil of law-abiding days
<A NAME="143"></A><BR>And blissful, fleeting hours henceforth they dreamed.
<A NAME="144"></A><BR>All the War's Story in their eager ears
<A NAME="145"></A><BR>He sang -- how leagued peoples gathering met
<A NAME="146"></A><BR>At hallowed Aulis -- how the invincible strength
<A NAME="147"></A><BR>Of Peleus' son smote fenced cities twelve
<A NAME="148"></A><BR>In sea-raids, how he marched o'er leagues on leagues
<A NAME="149"></A><BR>Of land, and spoiled eleven -- all he wrought
<A NAME="150"></A><BR>In fight with Telephus and Eetion --
<A NAME="151"></A><BR>How he slew giant Cycnus -- all the toil
<A NAME="152"></A><BR>Of war that through Achilles' wrath befell
<A NAME="153"></A><BR>The Achaeans -- how he dragged dead Hector round
<A NAME="154"></A><BR>His own Troy's wall, and how he slew in fight
<A NAME="155"></A><BR>Penthesileia and Tithonus' son: --
<A NAME="156"></A><BR>How Aias laid low Glaucus, lord of spears,
<A NAME="157"></A><BR>Then sang he how the child of Aeacus' son
<A NAME="158"></A><BR>Struck down Eurypylus, and how the shafts
<A NAME="159"></A><BR>Of Philoctetes dealt to Paris death.
<A NAME="160"></A><BR>Then the song named all heroes who passed in
<A NAME="161"></A><BR>To ambush in the Horse of Guile, and hymned
<A NAME="162"></A><BR>The fall of god-descended Priam's burg;
<A NAME="163"></A><BR>The feast he sang last, and peace after war;
<A NAME="164"></A><BR>Then many another, as they listed, sang.
<A NAME="165"></A><BR><BR>But when above those feasters midnight's stars
<A NAME="166"></A><BR>Hung, ceased the Danaans from the feast and wine,
<A NAME="167"></A><BR>And turned to sleep's forgetfulness of care,
<A NAME="168"></A><BR>For that with yesterday's war-travail all
<A NAME="169"></A><BR>Were wearied; wherefore they, who fain all night
<A NAME="170"></A><BR>Had revelled, needs must cease: how loth soe'er,
<A NAME="171"></A><BR>Sleep drew them thence; here, there, soft slumbered 
<A NAME="172"></A>they.
<A NAME="173"></A><BR><BR>But in his tent Menelaus lovingly
<A NAME="174"></A><BR>With bright-haired Helen spake; for on their eyes
<A NAME="175"></A><BR>Sleep had not fallen yet.  The Cyprian Queen
<A NAME="176"></A><BR>Brooded above their souls, that olden love
<A NAME="177"></A><BR>Might be renewed, and heart-ache chased away.
<A NAME="178"></A><BR><BR>Helen first brake the silence, and she said:
<A NAME="179"></A><BR>"O Menelaus, be not wroth with me!
<A NAME="180"></A><BR>Not of my will I left thy roof, thy bed,
<A NAME="181"></A><BR>But Alexander and the sons of Troy
<A NAME="182"></A><BR>Came upon me, and snatched away, when thou
<A NAME="183"></A><BR>Wast far thence.  Oftentimes did I essay
<A NAME="184"></A><BR>By the death-noose to perish wretchedly,
<A NAME="185"></A><BR>Or by the bitter sword; but still they stayed
<A NAME="186"></A><BR>Mine hand, and still spake comfortable words
<A NAME="187"></A><BR>To salve my grief for thee and my sweet child.
<A NAME="188"></A><BR>For her sake, for the sake of olden love,
<A NAME="189"></A><BR>And for thine own sake, I beseech thee now,
<A NAME="190"></A><BR>Forget thy stern displeasure against thy wife."
<A NAME="191"></A><BR><BR>Answered her Menelaus wise of wit:
<A NAME="192"></A><BR>"No more remember past griefs: seal them up
<A NAME="193"></A><BR>Hid in thine heart.  Let all be locked within
<A NAME="194"></A><BR>The dim dark mansion of forgetfulness.
<A NAME="195"></A><BR>What profits it to call ill deeds to mind?"
<A NAME="196"></A><BR><BR>Glad was she then: fear flitted from her heart,
<A NAME="197"></A><BR>And came sweet hope that her lord's wrath was dead.
<A NAME="198"></A><BR>She cast her arms around him, and their eyes
<A NAME="199"></A><BR>With tears were brimming as they made sweet moan;
<A NAME="200"></A><BR>And side by side they laid them, and their hearts
<A NAME="201"></A><BR>Thrilled with remembrance of old spousal joy.
<A NAME="202"></A><BR>And as a vine and ivy entwine their stems
<A NAME="203"></A><BR>Each around other, that no might of wind
<A NAME="204"></A><BR>Avails to sever them, so clung these twain
<A NAME="205"></A><BR>Twined in the passionate embrace of love.
<A NAME="206"></A><BR><BR>When came on these too sorrow-drowning sleep,
<A NAME="207"></A><BR>Even then above his son's head rose and stood
<A NAME="208"></A><BR>Godlike Achilles' mighty shade, in form
<A NAME="209"></A><BR>As when he lived, the Trojans' bane, the joy
<A NAME="210"></A><BR>Of Greeks, and kissed his neck and flashing eyes
<A NAME="211"></A><BR>Lovingly, and spake comfortable words:
<A NAME="212"></A><BR>"All hail, my son!  Vex not thine heart with grief
<A NAME="213"></A><BR>For thy dead sire; for with the Blessed Gods
<A NAME="214"></A><BR>Now at the feast I sit.  Refrain thy soul
<A NAME="215"></A><BR>From sorrow, and plant my strength within thy mind.
<A NAME="216"></A><BR>Be foremost of the Argives ever; yield
<A NAME="217"></A><BR>To none in valour, but in council bow
<A NAME="218"></A><BR>Before thine elders: so shall all acclaim
<A NAME="219"></A><BR>Thy courtesy.  Honour princely men and wise;
<A NAME="220"></A><BR>For the true man is still the true man's friend,
<A NAME="221"></A><BR>Even as the vile man cleaveth to the knave.
<A NAME="222"></A><BR>If good thy thought be, good shall be thy deeds:
<A NAME="223"></A><BR>But no man shall attain to Honour's height,
<A NAME="224"></A><BR>Except his heart be right within: her stem
<A NAME="225"></A><BR>Is hard to climb, and high in heaven spread
<A NAME="226"></A><BR>Her branches: only they whom strength and toil
<A NAME="227"></A><BR>Attend, strain up to pluck her blissful fruit,
<A NAME="228"></A><BR>Climbing the Tree of Honour glow-crowned.
<A NAME="229"></A><BR>Thou therefore follow fame, and let thy soul
<A NAME="230"></A><BR>Be not in sorrow afflicted overmuch,
<A NAME="231"></A><BR>Nor in prosperity over-glad.  To friends,
<A NAME="232"></A><BR>To comrades, child and wife, be kindly of heart,
<A NAME="233"></A><BR>Remembering still that near to all men stand
<A NAME="234"></A><BR>The gates of doom, the mansions of the dead:
<A NAME="235"></A><BR>For humankind are like the flower of grass,
<A NAME="236"></A><BR>The blossom of spring; these fade the while those 
<A NAME="237"></A>bloom:
<A NAME="238"></A><BR>Therefore be ever kindly with thy kind.
<A NAME="239"></A><BR>Now to the Argives say -- to Atreus' son
<A NAME="240"></A><BR>Agamemnon chiefly -- if my battle-toil
<A NAME="241"></A><BR>Round Priam's walls, and those sea-raids I led
<A NAME="242"></A><BR>Or ever I set foot on Trojan land,
<A NAME="243"></A><BR>Be in their hearts remembered, to my tomb
<A NAME="244"></A><BR>Be Priam's daughter Polyxeina led --
<A NAME="245"></A><BR>Whom as my portion of the spoil I claim --
<A NAME="246"></A><BR>And sacrificed thereon: else shall my wrath
<A NAME="247"></A><BR>Against them more than for Briseis burn.
<A NAME="248"></A><BR>The waves of the great deep will I turmoil
<A NAME="249"></A><BR>To bar their way, upstirring storm on storm,
<A NAME="250"></A><BR>That through their own mad folly pining away
<A NAME="251"></A><BR>Here they may linger long, until to me
<A NAME="252"></A><BR>They pour drink-offerings, yearning sore for home.
<A NAME="253"></A><BR>But, when they have slain the maiden, I grudge not
<A NAME="254"></A><BR>That whoso will may bury her far from me."
<A NAME="255"></A><BR><BR>Then as a wind-breath swift he fleeted thence,
<A NAME="256"></A><BR>And came to the Elysian Plain, whereto
<A NAME="257"></A><BR>A path to heaven reacheth, for the feet
<A NAME="258"></A><BR>Ascending and descending of the Blest.
<A NAME="259"></A><BR>Then the son started up from sleep, and called
<A NAME="260"></A><BR>His sire to mind, and glowed the heart in him.
<A NAME="261"></A><BR><BR>When to wide heaven the Child of Mist uprose,
<A NAME="262"></A><BR>Scattering night, unveiling earth and air,
<A NAME="263"></A><BR>Then from their rest upsprang Achaea's sons
<A NAME="264"></A><BR>Yearning for home.  With laughter 'gan they hale
<A NAME="265"></A><BR>Down to the sea the keels: but lo, their haste
<A NAME="266"></A><BR>Was reined in by Achilles' mighty son:
<A NAME="267"></A><BR><BR>He assembled them, and told his sire's behest:
<A NAME="268"></A><BR>"Hearken, dear sons of Argives battle-staunch,
<A NAME="269"></A><BR>To this my glorious father's hest, to me
<A NAME="270"></A><BR>Spoken in darkness slumbering on my bed:
<A NAME="271"></A><BR>He saith, he dwells with the Immortal Gods:
<A NAME="272"></A><BR>He biddeth you and Atreus' son the king
<A NAME="273"></A><BR>To bring, as his war-guerdon passing-fair,
<A NAME="274"></A><BR>To his dim dark tomb Polyxeina queenly-robed,
<A NAME="275"></A><BR>To slay her there, but far thence bury her.
<A NAME="276"></A><BR>But if ye slight him, and essay to sail
<A NAME="277"></A><BR>The sea, he threateneth to stir up the waves
<A NAME="278"></A><BR>To bar your path upon the deep, and here
<A NAME="279"></A><BR>Storm-bound long time to hold you, ships and men."
<A NAME="280"></A><BR><BR>Then hearkened they, and as to a God they prayed;
<A NAME="281"></A><BR>For even now a storm-blast on the sea
<A NAME="282"></A><BR>Upheaved the waves, broad-backed and thronging fast
<A NAME="283"></A><BR>More than before beneath the madding wind.
<A NAME="284"></A><BR>Tossed the great deep, smit by Poseidon's hands
<A NAME="285"></A><BR>For a grace to strong Achilles.  All the winds
<A NAME="286"></A><BR>Swooped on the waters.  Prayed the Dardans all
<A NAME="287"></A><BR>To Achilles, and a man to his fellow cried:
<A NAME="288"></A><BR>"Great Zeus's seed Achilles verily was;
<A NAME="289"></A><BR>Therefore is he a God, who in days past
<A NAME="290"></A><BR>Dwelt among us; for lapse of dateless time
<A NAME="291"></A><BR>Makes not the sons of Heaven to fade away."
<A NAME="292"></A><BR><BR>Then to Achilles' tomb the host returned,
<A NAME="293"></A><BR>And led the maid, as calf by herdmen dragged
<A NAME="294"></A><BR>For sacrifice, from woodland pastures torn
<A NAME="295"></A><BR>From its mother's side, and lowing long and loud
<A NAME="296"></A><BR>It moans with anguished heart; so Priam's child
<A NAME="297"></A><BR>Wailed in the hands of foes.  Down streamed her 
<A NAME="298"></A>tears
<A NAME="299"></A><BR>As when beneath the heavy sacks of sand
<A NAME="300"></A><BR>Olives clear-skinned, ne'er blotched by drops of 
<A NAME="301"></A>storm,
<A NAME="302"></A><BR>Pour out their oil, when the long levers creak
<A NAME="303"></A><BR>As strong men strain the cords; so poured the tears
<A NAME="304"></A><BR>Of travail-burdened Priam's daughter, haled
<A NAME="305"></A><BR>To stern Achilles' tomb, tears blent with moans.
<A NAME="306"></A><BR>Drenched were her bosom-folds, glistened the drops
<A NAME="307"></A><BR>On flesh clear-white as costly ivory.
<A NAME="308"></A><BR><BR>Then, to crown all her griefs, yet sharper pain
<A NAME="309"></A><BR>Fell on the heart of hapless Hecuba.
<A NAME="310"></A><BR>Then did her soul recall that awful dream,
<A NAME="311"></A><BR>The vision of sleep of that night overpast:
<A NAME="312"></A><BR>Herseemed that on Achilles' tomb she stood
<A NAME="313"></A><BR>Moaning, her hair down-streaming to the ground,
<A NAME="314"></A><BR>And from her breasts blood dripped to earth the 
<A NAME="315"></A>while,
<A NAME="316"></A><BR>And drenched the tomb.  Fear-haunted touching this,
<A NAME="317"></A><BR>Foreboding all calamity, she wailed
<A NAME="318"></A><BR>Piteously; far rang her wild lament.
<A NAME="319"></A><BR>As a dog moaning at her master's door,
<A NAME="320"></A><BR>Utters long howls, her teats with milk distent,
<A NAME="321"></A><BR>Whose whelps, ere their eyes opened to the light,
<A NAME="322"></A><BR>Her lords afar have flung, a prey to kites;
<A NAME="323"></A><BR>And now with short sharp cries she plains, and now
<A NAME="324"></A><BR>Long howling: the weird outcry thrills the air;
<A NAME="325"></A><BR>So wailed and shrieked for her child Hecuba:
<A NAME="326"></A><BR>"Ah me! what sorrows first or last shall I
<A NAME="327"></A><BR>Lament heart-anguished, who am full of woes?
<A NAME="328"></A><BR>Those unimagined ills my sons, my king
<A NAME="329"></A><BR>Have suffered?  or my city, or daughters shamed?
<A NAME="330"></A><BR>Or my despair, my day of slavery?
<A NAME="331"></A><BR>Oh, the grim fates have caught me in a net
<A NAME="332"></A><BR>Of manifold ills!  O child, they have spun for thee
<A NAME="333"></A><BR>Dread weird of unimagined misery!
<A NAME="334"></A><BR>They have thrust thee away, when near was Hymen"s 
<A NAME="335"></A>hymn,
<A NAME="336"></A><BR>From thine espousals, marked thee for destruction
<A NAME="337"></A><BR>Dark, unendurable, unspeakable!
<A NAME="338"></A><BR>For lo, a dead man's heart, Achilles' heart,
<A NAME="339"></A><BR>Is by our blood made warm with life to-day!
<A NAME="340"></A><BR>O child, dear child, that I might die with thee,
<A NAME="341"></A><BR>That earth might swallow me, ere I see thy doom!"
<A NAME="342"></A><BR>So cried she, weeping never-ceasing tears,
<A NAME="343"></A><BR>For grief on bitter grief encompassed her.
<A NAME="344"></A><BR>But when these reached divine Achilles' tomb,
<A NAME="345"></A><BR>Then did his son unsheathe the whetted sword,
<A NAME="346"></A><BR>His left hand grasped the maid, and his right hand
<A NAME="347"></A><BR>Was laid upon the tomb, and thus he cried:
<A NAME="348"></A><BR>"Hear, father, thy son's prayer, hear all the prayers
<A NAME="349"></A><BR>Of Argives, and be no more wroth with us!
<A NAME="350"></A><BR>Lo, unto thee now all thine heart's desire
<A NAME="351"></A><BR>Will we fulfil.  Be gracious to us thou,
<A NAME="352"></A><BR>And to our praying grant sweet home-return."
<A NAME="353"></A><BR><BR>Into the maid's throat then he plunged the blade
<A NAME="354"></A><BR>Of death: the dear life straightway sobbed she forth,
<A NAME="355"></A><BR>With the last piteous moan of parting breath.
<A NAME="356"></A><BR>Face-downward to the earth she fell: all round
<A NAME="357"></A><BR>Her flesh was crimsoned from her neck, as snow
<A NAME="358"></A><BR>Stained on a mountain-side with scarlet blood
<A NAME="359"></A><BR>Rushing, from javelin-smitten boar or bear.
<A NAME="360"></A><BR>The maiden's corpse then gave they, to be borne
<A NAME="361"></A><BR>Unto the city, to Antenor's home,
<A NAME="362"></A><BR>For that, when Troy yet stood, he nurtured her
<A NAME="363"></A><BR>In his fair halls, a bride for his own son
<A NAME="364"></A><BR>Eurymachus.  The old man buried her,
<A NAME="365"></A><BR>King Priam's princess-child, nigh his own house,
<A NAME="366"></A><BR>By Ganymedes' shrine, and overagainst
<A NAME="367"></A><BR>The temple of Pallas the Unwearied One.
<A NAME="368"></A><BR>Then were the waves stilled, and the blast was hushed
<A NAME="369"></A><BR>To sleep, and all the sea-flood lulled to calm.
<A NAME="370"></A><BR><BR>Swift with glad laughter hied they to the ships,
<A NAME="371"></A><BR>Hymning Achilles and the Blessed Ones.
<A NAME="372"></A><BR>A feast they made, first severing thighs of kine
<A NAME="373"></A><BR>For the Immortals.  Gladsome sacrifice
<A NAME="374"></A><BR>Steamed on all sides: in cups of silver and gold
<A NAME="375"></A><BR>They drank sweet wine: their hearts leaped up with 
<A NAME="376"></A>hope
<A NAME="377"></A><BR>Of winning to their fatherland again.
<A NAME="378"></A><BR>But when with meats and wine all these were filled,
<A NAME="379"></A><BR>Then in their eager ears spake Neleus' son:
<A NAME="380"></A><BR>"Hear, friends, who have 'scaped the long turmoil of 
<A NAME="381"></A>war,
<A NAME="382"></A><BR>That I may say to you one welcome word:
<A NAME="383"></A><BR>Now is the hour of heart's delight, the hour
<A NAME="384"></A><BR>Of home-return.  Away!  Achilles soul
<A NAME="385"></A><BR>Hath ceased from ruinous wrath; Earth-shaker stills
<A NAME="386"></A><BR>The stormy wave, and gentle breezes blow;
<A NAME="387"></A><BR>No more the waves toss high.  Haste, hale the ships
<A NAME="388"></A><BR>Down to the sea.  Now, ho for home-return!"
<A NAME="389"></A><BR><BR>Eager they heard, and ready made the ships.
<A NAME="390"></A><BR>Then was a marvellous portent seen of men;
<A NAME="391"></A><BR>For all-unhappy Priam's queen was changed
<A NAME="392"></A><BR>From woman's form into a pitiful hound;
<A NAME="393"></A><BR>And all men gathered round in wondering awe.
<A NAME="394"></A><BR>Then all her body a God transformed to stone --
<A NAME="395"></A><BR>A mighty marvel for men yet unborn!
<A NAME="396"></A><BR>At Calchas' bidding this the Achaeans bore
<A NAME="397"></A><BR>In a swift ship to Hellespont's far side.
<A NAME="398"></A><BR>Then down to the sea in haste they ran the keels:
<A NAME="399"></A><BR>Their wealth they laid aboard, even all the spoil
<A NAME="400"></A><BR>Taken, or ever unto Troy they came,
<A NAME="401"></A><BR>From conquered neighbour peoples; therewithal
<A NAME="402"></A><BR>Whatso they took from Ilium, wherein most
<A NAME="403"></A><BR>They joyed, for untold was the sum thereof.
<A NAME="404"></A><BR>And followed with them many a captive maid
<A NAME="405"></A><BR>With anguished heart: so went they aboard the ships.
<A NAME="406"></A><BR>But Calchas would not with that eager host
<A NAME="407"></A><BR>Launch forth; yea, he had fain withheld therefrom
<A NAME="408"></A><BR>All the Achaeans, for his prophet-soul
<A NAME="409"></A><BR>Foreboded dread destruction looming o'er
<A NAME="410"></A><BR>The Argives by the Rocks Capherean.
<A NAME="411"></A><BR>But naught they heeded him; malignant
<A NAME="412"></A><BR>Fate Deluded men's souls: only Amphilochus
<A NAME="413"></A><BR>The wise in prophet-lore, the gallant son
<A NAME="414"></A><BR>Of princely Amphiaraus, stayed with him.
<A NAME="415"></A><BR>Fated were these twain, far from their own land,
<A NAME="416"></A><BR>To reach Pamphylian and Cilician burgs;
<A NAME="417"></A><BR>And this the Gods thereafter brought to pass.
<A NAME="418"></A><BR><BR>But now the Achaeans cast the hawsers loose
<A NAME="419"></A><BR>From shore: in haste they heaved the anchor-stones.
<A NAME="420"></A><BR>Roared Hellespont beneath swift-flashing oars;
<A NAME="421"></A><BR>Crashed the prows through the sea.  About the bows
<A NAME="422"></A><BR>Much armour of slain foes was lying heaped:
<A NAME="423"></A><BR>Along the bulwarks victory-trophies hung
<A NAME="424"></A><BR>Countless.  With garlands wreathed they all the 
<A NAME="425"></A>ships,
<A NAME="426"></A><BR>Their heads, the spears, the shields wherewith they had 
<A NAME="427"></A>fought
<A NAME="428"></A><BR>Against their foes.  The chiefs stood on the prows,
<A NAME="429"></A><BR>And poured into the dark sea once and again
<A NAME="430"></A><BR>Wine to the Gods, to grant them safe return.
<A NAME="431"></A><BR>But with the winds their prayers mixed; far away
<A NAME="432"></A><BR>Vainly they floated blent with cloud and air.
<A NAME="433"></A><BR><BR>With anguished hearts the captive maids looked 
<A NAME="434"></A>back
<A NAME="435"></A><BR>On Ilium, and with sobs and moans they wailed,
<A NAME="436"></A><BR>Striving to hide their grief from Argive eyes.
<A NAME="437"></A><BR>Clasping their knees some sat; in misery some
<A NAME="438"></A><BR>Veiled with their hands their faces; others nursed
<A NAME="439"></A><BR>Young children in their arms: those innocents
<A NAME="440"></A><BR>Not yet bewailed their day of bondage, nor
<A NAME="441"></A><BR>Their country's ruin; all their thoughts were set
<A NAME="442"></A><BR>On comfort of the breast, for the babe's heart
<A NAME="443"></A><BR>Hath none affinity with sorrow.  All
<A NAME="444"></A><BR>Sat with unbraided hair and pitiful breasts
<A NAME="445"></A><BR>Scored with their fingers.  On their cheeks there 
<A NAME="446"></A>lay
<A NAME="447"></A><BR>Stains of dried tears, and streamed thereover now
<A NAME="448"></A><BR>Fresh tears full fast, as still they gazed aback
<A NAME="449"></A><BR>On the lost hapless home, wherefrom yet rose
<A NAME="450"></A><BR>The flames, and o'er it writhed the rolling smoke.
<A NAME="451"></A><BR>Now on Cassandra marvelling they gazed,
<A NAME="452"></A><BR>Calling to mind her prophecy of doom;
<A NAME="453"></A><BR>But at their tears she laughed in bitter scorn,
<A NAME="454"></A><BR>In anguish for the ruin of her land.
<A NAME="455"></A><BR><BR>Such Trojans as had scaped from pitiless war
<A NAME="456"></A><BR>Gathered to render now the burial-dues
<A NAME="457"></A><BR>Unto their city's slain.  Antenor led
<A NAME="458"></A><BR>To that sad work: one pyre for all they raised.
<A NAME="459"></A><BR><BR>But laughed with triumphing hearts the Argive 
<A NAME="460"></A>men,
<A NAME="461"></A><BR>As now with oars they swept o'er dark sea-ways,
<A NAME="462"></A><BR>Now hastily hoised the sails high o'er the ships,
<A NAME="463"></A><BR>And fleeted fast astern Dardania-land,
<A NAME="464"></A><BR>And Hero Achilles' tomb.  But now their hearts,
<A NAME="465"></A><BR>How blithe soe'er, remembered comrades slain,
<A NAME="466"></A><BR>And sorely grieved, and wistfully they looked
<A NAME="467"></A><BR>Back to the alien's land; it seemed to them
<A NAME="468"></A><BR>Aye sliding farther from their ships.  Full soon
<A NAME="469"></A><BR>By Tenedos' beaches slipt they: now they ran
<A NAME="470"></A><BR>By Chrysa, Sminthian Phoebus' holy place,
<A NAME="471"></A><BR>And hallowed Cilla.  Far away were glimpsed
<A NAME="472"></A><BR>The windy heights of Lesbos.  Rounded now
<A NAME="473"></A><BR>Was Lecton's foreland, where is the last peak
<A NAME="474"></A><BR>Of Ida.  In the sails loud hummed the wind,
<A NAME="475"></A><BR>Crashed round the prows the dark surge: the long 
<A NAME="476"></A>waves
<A NAME="477"></A><BR>Showed shadowy hollows, far the white wake gleamed.
<A NAME="478"></A><BR><BR>Now had the Argives all to the hallowed soil
<A NAME="479"></A><BR>Of Hellas won, by perils of the deep
<A NAME="480"></A><BR>Unscathed, but for Athena Daughter of Zeus
<A NAME="481"></A><BR>The Thunderer, and her indignation's wrath.
<A NAME="482"></A><BR>When nigh Euboea's windy heights they drew,
<A NAME="483"></A><BR>She rose, in anger unappeasable
<A NAME="484"></A><BR>Against the Locrian king, devising doom
<A NAME="485"></A><BR>Crushing and pitiless, and drew nigh to Zeus
<A NAME="486"></A><BR>Lord of the Gods, and spake to him apart
<A NAME="487"></A><BR>In wrath that in her breast would not be pent:
<A NAME="488"></A><BR>"Zeus, Father, unendurable of Gods
<A NAME="489"></A><BR>Is men's presumption!  They reck not of thee,
<A NAME="490"></A><BR>Of none of the Blessed reck they, forasmuch
<A NAME="491"></A><BR>As vengeance followeth after sin no more;
<A NAME="492"></A><BR>And ofttimes more afflicted are good men
<A NAME="493"></A><BR>Than evil, and their misery hath no end.
<A NAME="494"></A><BR>Therefore no man regardeth justice: shame
<A NAME="495"></A><BR>Lives not with men!  And I, I will not dwell
<A NAME="496"></A><BR>Hereafter in Olympus, not be named
<A NAME="497"></A><BR>Thy daughter, if I may not be avenged
<A NAME="498"></A><BR>On the Achaeans' reckless sin!  Behold,
<A NAME="499"></A><BR>Within my very temple Oileus' son
<A NAME="500"></A><BR>Hath wrought iniquity, hath pitied not
<A NAME="501"></A><BR>Cassandra stretching unregarded hands
<A NAME="502"></A><BR>Once and again to me; nor did he dread
<A NAME="503"></A><BR>My might, nor reverenced in his wicked heart
<A NAME="504"></A><BR>The Immortal, but a deed intolerable
<A NAME="505"></A><BR>He did.  Therefore let not thy spirit divine
<A NAME="506"></A><BR>Begrudge mine heart's desire, that so all men
<A NAME="507"></A><BR>May quake before the manifest wrath of Gods."
<A NAME="508"></A><BR><BR>Answered the Sire with heart-assuaging words:
<A NAME="509"></A><BR>"Child, not for the Argives' sake withstand I thee;
<A NAME="510"></A><BR>But all mine armoury which the Cyclops' might
<A NAME="511"></A><BR>To win my favour wrought with tireless hands,
<A NAME="512"></A><BR>To thy desire I give.  O strong heart, hurl
<A NAME="513"></A><BR>A ruining storm thyself on the Argive fleet."
<A NAME="514"></A><BR><BR>Then down before the aweless Maid he cast
<A NAME="515"></A><BR>Swift lightning, thunder, and deadly thunderbolt;
<A NAME="516"></A><BR>And her heart leapt, and gladdened was her soul.
<A NAME="517"></A><BR>She donned the stormy Aegis flashing far,
<A NAME="518"></A><BR>Adamantine, massy, a marvel to the Gods,
<A NAME="519"></A><BR>Whereon was wrought Medusa's ghastly head,
<A NAME="520"></A><BR>Fearful: strong serpents breathing forth the blast
<A NAME="521"></A><BR>Of ravening fire were on the face thereof.
<A NAME="522"></A><BR>Crashed on the Queen's breast all the Aegis-links,
<A NAME="523"></A><BR>As after lightning crashes the firmament.
<A NAME="524"></A><BR>Then grasped she her father's weapons, which no 
<A NAME="525"></A>God
<A NAME="526"></A><BR>Save Zeus can lift, and wide Olympus shook.
<A NAME="527"></A><BR>Then swept she clouds and mist together on high;
<A NAME="528"></A><BR>Night over earth was poured, haze o'er the sea.
<A NAME="529"></A><BR>Zeus watched, and was right glad as broad heaven's 
<A NAME="530"></A>floor
<A NAME="531"></A><BR>Rocked 'neath the Goddess's feet, and crashed the 
<A NAME="532"></A>sky,
<A NAME="533"></A><BR>As though invincible Zeus rushed forth to war.
<A NAME="534"></A><BR>Then sped she Iris unto Acolus,
<A NAME="535"></A><BR>From heaven far-flying over misty seas,
<A NAME="536"></A><BR>To bid him send forth all his buffering winds
<A NAME="537"></A><BR>O'er iron-bound Caphereus' cliffs to sweep
<A NAME="538"></A><BR>Ceaselessly, and with ruin of madding blasts
<A NAME="539"></A><BR>To upheave the sea.  And Iris heard, and swift
<A NAME="540"></A><BR>She darted, through cloud-billows plunging down 
<A NAME="541"></A>--
<A NAME="542"></A><BR>Thou hadst said: "Lo, in the sky dark water and 
<A NAME="543"></A>fire!"
<A NAME="544"></A><BR>And to Aeolia came she, isle of caves,
<A NAME="545"></A><BR>Of echoing dungeons of mad-raging winds
<A NAME="546"></A><BR>With rugged ribs of mountain overarched,
<A NAME="547"></A><BR>Whereby the mansion stands of Aeolus
<A NAME="548"></A><BR>Hippotas' son.  Him found she therewithin
<A NAME="549"></A><BR>With wife and twelve sons; and she told to him
<A NAME="550"></A><BR>Athena's purpose toward the homeward-bound
<A NAME="551"></A><BR>Achaeans.  He denied her not, but passed
<A NAME="552"></A><BR>Forth of his halls, and in resistless hands
<A NAME="553"></A><BR>Upswung his trident, smiting the mountain-side
<A NAME="554"></A><BR>Within whose chasm-cell the wild winds dwelt
<A NAME="555"></A><BR>Tempestuously shrieking.  Ever pealed
<A NAME="556"></A><BR>Weird roarings of their voices round its vaults.
<A NAME="557"></A><BR>Cleft by his might was the hill-side; forth they 
<A NAME="558"></A>poured.
<A NAME="559"></A><BR>He bade them on their wings bear blackest storm
<A NAME="560"></A><BR>To upheave the sea, and shroud Caphereus' heights.
<A NAME="561"></A><BR>Swiftly upsprang they, ere their king's command
<A NAME="562"></A><BR>Was fully spoken.  Mightily moaned the sea
<A NAME="563"></A><BR>As they rushed o'er it; waves like mountain-cliffs
<A NAME="564"></A><BR>From all sides were uprolled.  The Achaeans' hearts
<A NAME="565"></A><BR>Were terror-palsied, as the uptowering surge
<A NAME="566"></A><BR>Now swung the ships up high through palling mist,
<A NAME="567"></A><BR>Now hurled them rolled as down a precipice
<A NAME="568"></A><BR>To dark abysses.  Up through yawning deeps
<A NAME="569"></A><BR>Some power resistless belched the boiling sand
<A NAME="570"></A><BR>From the sea's floor.  Tossed in despair, fear-dazed,
<A NAME="571"></A><BR>Men could not grasp the oar, nor reef the sail
<A NAME="572"></A><BR>About the yard-arm, howsoever fain,
<A NAME="573"></A><BR>Ere the winds rent it, could not with the sheets
<A NAME="574"></A><BR>Trim the torn canvas, buffeted so were they
<A NAME="575"></A><BR>By ruining blasts.  The helmsman had no power
<A NAME="576"></A><BR>To guide the rudder with his practised hands,
<A NAME="577"></A><BR>For those ill winds hurled all confusedly.
<A NAME="578"></A><BR>No hope of life was left them: blackest night,
<A NAME="579"></A><BR>Fury of tempest, wrath of deathless Gods,
<A NAME="580"></A><BR>Raged round them.  Still Poseidon heaved and swung
<A NAME="581"></A><BR>The merciless sea, to work the heart's desire
<A NAME="582"></A><BR>Of his brother's glorious child; and she on high
<A NAME="583"></A><BR>Stormed with her lightnings, ruthless in her rage.
<A NAME="584"></A><BR>Thundered from heaven Zeus, in purpose fixed
<A NAME="585"></A><BR>To glorify his daughter.  All the isles
<A NAME="586"></A><BR>And mainlands round were lashed by leaping seas
<A NAME="587"></A><BR>Nigh to Euboea, where the Power divine
<A NAME="588"></A><BR>Scourged most with unrelenting stroke on stroke
<A NAME="589"></A><BR>The Argives.  Groan and shriek of perishing men
<A NAME="590"></A><BR>Rang through the ships; started great beams and 
<A NAME="591"></A>snapped
<A NAME="592"></A><BR>With ominous sound, for ever ship on ship
<A NAME="593"></A><BR>With shivering timbers crashed.  With hopeless toil
<A NAME="594"></A><BR>Men strained with oars to thrust back hulls that 
<A NAME="595"></A>reeled
<A NAME="596"></A><BR>Down on their own, but with the shattered planks
<A NAME="597"></A><BR>Were hurled into the abyss, to perish there
<A NAME="598"></A><BR>By pitiless doom; for beams of foundering ships
<A NAME="599"></A><BR>From this, from that side battered out their lives,
<A NAME="600"></A><BR>And crushed were all their bodies wretchedly.
<A NAME="601"></A><BR>Some in the ships fell down, and like dead men
<A NAME="602"></A><BR>Lay there; some, in the grip of destiny,
<A NAME="603"></A><BR>Clinging to oars smooth-shaven, tried to swim;
<A NAME="604"></A><BR>Some upon planks were tossing.  Roared the surge
<A NAME="605"></A><BR>From fathomless depths: it seemed as though sea, 
<A NAME="606"></A>sky,
<A NAME="607"></A><BR>And land were blended all confusedly.
<A NAME="608"></A><BR><BR>Still from Olympus thundering Atrytone
<A NAME="609"></A><BR>Wielded her Father's power unshamed, and still
<A NAME="610"></A><BR>The welkin shrieked around.  Her ruin of wrath
<A NAME="611"></A><BR>Now upon Aias hurled she: on his ship
<A NAME="612"></A><BR>Dashed she a thunderbolt, and shivered it
<A NAME="613"></A><BR>Wide in a moment into fragments small,
<A NAME="614"></A><BR>While earth and air yelled o'er the wreck, and whirled
<A NAME="615"></A><BR>And plunged and fell the whole sea down thereon.
<A NAME="616"></A><BR>They in the ship were all together flung
<A NAME="617"></A><BR>Forth: all about them swept the giant waves,
<A NAME="618"></A><BR>Round them leapt lightnings flaming through the 
<A NAME="619"></A>dark.
<A NAME="620"></A><BR>Choked with the strangling surf of hissing brine,
<A NAME="621"></A><BR>Gasping out life, they drifted o'er the sea.
<A NAME="622"></A><BR><BR>But even in death those captive maids rejoiced,
<A NAME="623"></A><BR>As some ill-starred ones, clasping to their breasts
<A NAME="624"></A><BR>Their babes, sank in the sea; some flung their arms
<A NAME="625"></A><BR>Round Danaans' horror-stricken heads, and dragged
<A NAME="626"></A><BR>These down with them, so rendering to their foes
<A NAME="627"></A><BR>Requital for foul outrage down to them.
<A NAME="628"></A><BR>And from on high the haughty Trito-born
<A NAME="629"></A><BR>Looked down on all this, and her heart was glad.
<A NAME="630"></A><BR><BR>But Aias floated now on a galley's plank,
<A NAME="631"></A><BR>Now through the brine with strong hands oared his 
<A NAME="632"></A>path,
<A NAME="633"></A><BR>Like some old Titan in his tireless might.
<A NAME="634"></A><BR>Cleft was the salt sea-surge by the sinewy hands
<A NAME="635"></A><BR>Of that undaunted man: the Gods beheld
<A NAME="636"></A><BR>And marvelled at his courage and his strength.
<A NAME="637"></A><BR>But now the billows swung him up on high
<A NAME="638"></A><BR>Through misty air, as though to a mountain's peak,
<A NAME="639"></A><BR>Now whelmed him down, as they would bury him
<A NAME="640"></A><BR>In ravening whirlpits: yet his stubborn hands
<A NAME="641"></A><BR>Toiled on unwearied.  Aye to right and left
<A NAME="642"></A><BR>Flashed lightnings down, and quenched them in the 
<A NAME="643"></A>sea;
<A NAME="644"></A><BR>For not yet was the Child of Thunderer Zeus
<A NAME="645"></A><BR>Purposed to smite him dead, despite her wrath,
<A NAME="646"></A><BR>Ere he had drained the cup of travail and pain
<A NAME="647"></A><BR>Down to the dregs; so in the deep long time
<A NAME="648"></A><BR>Affliction wore him down, tormented sore
<A NAME="649"></A><BR>On every side.  Grim Fates stood round the man
<A NAME="650"></A><BR>Unnumbered; yet despair still kindled strength.
<A NAME="651"></A><BR>He cried: "Though all the Olympians banded come
<A NAME="652"></A><BR>In wrath, and rouse against me all the sea,
<A NAME="653"></A><BR>I will escape them!"  But no whit did he
<A NAME="654"></A><BR>Elude the Gods' wrath; for the Shaker of Earth
<A NAME="655"></A><BR>In fierceness of his indignation marked
<A NAME="656"></A><BR>Where his hands clung to the Gyraean Rock,
<A NAME="657"></A><BR>And in stern anger with an earthquake shook
<A NAME="658"></A><BR>Both sea and land.  Around on all sides crashed
<A NAME="659"></A><BR>Caphereus' cliffs: beneath the Sea-king's wrath
<A NAME="660"></A><BR>The surf-tormented beaches shrieked and roared.
<A NAME="661"></A><BR>The broad crag rifted reeled into the sea,
<A NAME="662"></A><BR>The rock whereto his desperate hands had clung;
<A NAME="663"></A><BR>Yet did he writhe up round its jutting spurs,
<A NAME="664"></A><BR>While flayed his hands were, and from 'neath his 
<A NAME="665"></A>nails
<A NAME="666"></A><BR>The blood ran.  Wrestling with him roared the waves,
<A NAME="667"></A><BR>And the foam whitened all his hair and beard.
<A NAME="668"></A><BR><BR>Yet had he 'scaped perchance his evil doom,
<A NAME="669"></A><BR>Had not Poseidon, wroth with his hardihood,
<A NAME="670"></A><BR>Cleaving the earth, hurled down the chasm the rock,
<A NAME="671"></A><BR>As in the old time Pallas heaved on high
<A NAME="672"></A><BR>Sicily, and on huge Enceladus
<A NAME="673"></A><BR>Dashed down the isle, which burns with the burning 
<A NAME="674"></A>yet
<A NAME="675"></A><BR>Of that immortal giant, as he breathes
<A NAME="676"></A><BR>Fire underground; so did the mountain-crag,
<A NAME="677"></A><BR>Hurled from on high, bury the Locrian king,
<A NAME="678"></A><BR>Pinning the strong man down, a wretch crushed flat.
<A NAME="679"></A><BR>And so on him death's black destruction came
<A NAME="680"></A><BR>Whom land and sea alike were leagued to slay.
<A NAME="681"></A><BR><BR>Still over the great deep were swept the rest
<A NAME="682"></A><BR>Of those Achaeans, crouching terror-dazed
<A NAME="683"></A><BR>Down in the ships, save those that mid the waves
<A NAME="684"></A><BR>Had fallen.  Misery encompassed all;
<A NAME="685"></A><BR>For some with heavily-plunging prows drave on,
<A NAME="686"></A><BR>With keels upturned some drifted.  Here were masts
<A NAME="687"></A><BR>Snapped from the hull by rushing gusts, and there
<A NAME="688"></A><BR>Were tempest-rifted wrecks of scattered beams;
<A NAME="689"></A><BR>And some had sunk, whelmed in the mighty deep,
<A NAME="690"></A><BR>Swamped by the torrent downpour from the clouds:
<A NAME="691"></A><BR>For these endured not madness of wind-tossed sea
<A NAME="692"></A><BR>Leagued with heaven's waterspout; for streamed the 
<A NAME="693"></A>sky
<A NAME="694"></A><BR>Ceaselessly like a river, while the deep
<A NAME="695"></A><BR>Raved round them.  And one cried: "Such floods on 
<A NAME="696"></A>men
<A NAME="697"></A><BR>Fell only when Deucalion's deluge came,
<A NAME="698"></A><BR>When earth was drowned, and all was fathomless sea!"
<A NAME="699"></A><BR><BR>So cried a Danaan, seeing soul-appalled
<A NAME="700"></A><BR>That wild storm.  Thousands perished; corpses thronged
<A NAME="701"></A><BR>The great sea-highways: all the beaches were
<A NAME="702"></A><BR>Too strait for them: the surf belched multitudes
<A NAME="703"></A><BR>Forth on the land.  The heavy-booming sea
<A NAME="704"></A><BR>With weltering beams of ships was wholly paved,
<A NAME="705"></A><BR>And here and there the grey waves gleamed between.
<A NAME="706"></A><BR><BR>So found they each his several evil fate,
<A NAME="707"></A><BR>Some whelmed beneath broad-rushing billows, some
<A NAME="708"></A><BR>Wretchedly perishing with their shattered ships
<A NAME="709"></A><BR>By Nauplius' devising on the rocks.
<A NAME="710"></A><BR>Wroth for that son whom they had done to death,
<A NAME="711"></A><BR>He; when the storm rose and the Argives died,
<A NAME="712"></A><BR>Rejoiced amid his sorrow, seeing a God
<A NAME="713"></A><BR>Gave to his hands revenge, which now he wreaked
<A NAME="714"></A><BR>Upon the host he hated, as o'er the deep
<A NAME="715"></A><BR>They tossed sore-harassed.  To his sea-god sire
<A NAME="716"></A><BR>He prayed that all might perish, ships and men
<A NAME="717"></A><BR>Whelmed in the deep.  Poseidon heard his prayer,
<A NAME="718"></A><BR>And on the dark surge swept them nigh his land.
<A NAME="719"></A><BR>He, like a harbour-warder, lifted high
<A NAME="720"></A><BR>A blazing torch, and so by guile he trapped
<A NAME="721"></A><BR>The Achaean men, who deemed that they had won
<A NAME="722"></A><BR>A sheltering haven: but sharp reefs and crags
<A NAME="723"></A><BR>Gave awful welcome unto ships and men,
<A NAME="724"></A><BR>Who, dashed to pieces on the cruel rocks
<A NAME="725"></A><BR>In the black night, crowned ills with direr ills.
<A NAME="726"></A><BR>Some few escaped, by a God or Power unseen
<A NAME="727"></A><BR>Plucked from death's hand.  Athena now rejoiced
<A NAME="728"></A><BR>Her heart within, and now was racked with fears
<A NAME="729"></A><BR>For prudent-souled Odysseus; for his weird
<A NAME="730"></A><BR>Was through Poseidon's wrath to suffer woes
<A NAME="731"></A><BR>Full many.
<A NAME="732"></A><BR><BR><B>But Earth-shaker's jealousy now</B>
<A NAME="733"></A><BR>Burned against those long walls and towers uppiled
<A NAME="734"></A><BR>By the strong Argives for a fence against
<A NAME="735"></A><BR>The Trojans' battle-onset.  Swiftly then
<A NAME="736"></A><BR>He swelled to overbrimming all the sea
<A NAME="737"></A><BR>That rolls from Euxine down to Hellespont,
<A NAME="738"></A><BR>And hurled it on the shore of Troy: and Zeus,
<A NAME="739"></A><BR>For a grace unto the glorious Shaker of Earth,
<A NAME="740"></A><BR>Poured rain from heaven: withal Far-darter bare
<A NAME="741"></A><BR>In that great work his part; from Ida's heights
<A NAME="742"></A><BR>Into one channel led he all her streams,
<A NAME="743"></A><BR>And flooded the Achaeans' work.  The sea
<A NAME="744"></A><BR>Dashed o'er it, and the roaring torrents still
<A NAME="745"></A><BR>Rushed on it, swollen by the rains of Zeus;
<A NAME="746"></A><BR>And the dark surge of the wide-moaning sea
<A NAME="747"></A><BR>Still hurled them back from mingling with the deep,
<A NAME="748"></A><BR>Till all the Danaan walls were blotted out
<A NAME="749"></A><BR>Beneath their desolating flood.  Then earth
<A NAME="750"></A><BR>Was by Poseidon chasm-cleft: up rushed
<A NAME="751"></A><BR>Deluge of water, slime and sand, while quaked
<A NAME="752"></A><BR>Sigeum with the mighty shock, and roared
<A NAME="753"></A><BR>The beach and the foundations of the land
<A NAME="754"></A><BR>Dardanian.  So vanished, whelmed from sight,
<A NAME="755"></A><BR>That mighty rampart.  Earth asunder yawned,
<A NAME="756"></A><BR>And all sank down, and only sand was seen,
<A NAME="757"></A><BR>When back the sea rolled, o'er the beach outspread
<A NAME="758"></A><BR>Far down the heavy-booming shore.  All this
<A NAME="759"></A><BR>The Immortals' anger wrought.  But in their ships
<A NAME="760"></A><BR>The Argives storm-dispersed went sailing on.
<A NAME="761"></A><BR>So came they home, as heaven guided each,
<A NAME="762"></A><BR>Even all that 'scaped the fell sea-tempest blasts.
