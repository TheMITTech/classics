<A NAME="10"></A><B>How the Son of Achilles Was Brought To the War from the Isle of 
<A NAME="11"></A>Scyros</B>
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="12"></A>When heaven hid his stars, and Dawn awoke
<A NAME="13"></A><BR>Outspraying splendour, and night's darkness fled,
<A NAME="14"></A><BR>Then undismayed the Argives' warrior-sons
<A NAME="15"></A><BR>Marched forth without the ships to meet in fight
<A NAME="16"></A><BR>Eurypylus, save those that tarried still
<A NAME="17"></A><BR>To render to Machaon midst the ships
<A NAME="18"></A><BR>Death-dues, with Nireus -- Nireus, who in grace
<A NAME="19"></A><BR>And goodlihead was like the Deathless Ones,
<A NAME="20"></A><BR>Yet was not strong in bodily might: the Gods
<A NAME="21"></A><BR>Grant not perfection in all things to men;
<A NAME="22"></A><BR>But evil still is blended with the good
<A NAME="23"></A><BR>By some strange fate: to Nireus' winsome grace
<A NAME="24"></A><BR>Was linked a weakling's prowess.  Yet the Greeks
<A NAME="25"></A><BR>Slighted him not, but gave him all death-dues,
<A NAME="26"></A><BR>And mourned above his grave with no less grief
<A NAME="27"></A><BR>Than for Machaon, whom they honoured aye,
<A NAME="28"></A><BR>For his deep wisdom, as the immortal Gods.
<A NAME="29"></A><BR>One mound they swiftly heaped above these twain.
<A NAME="30"></A><BR><BR>Then in the plain once more did murderous war
<A NAME="31"></A><BR>Madden: the multitudinous clash and cry
<A NAME="32"></A><BR>Rose, as the shields were shattered with huge stones,
<A NAME="33"></A><BR>Were pierced with lances.  So they toiled in fight;
<A NAME="34"></A><BR>But all this while lay Podaleirius
<A NAME="35"></A><BR>Fasting in dust and groaning, leaving not
<A NAME="36"></A><BR>His brother's tomb; and oft his heart was moved
<A NAME="37"></A><BR>With his own hands to slay himself.  And now
<A NAME="38"></A><BR>He clutched his sword, and now amidst his herbs
<A NAME="39"></A><BR>Sought for a deadly drug; and still his friends
<A NAME="40"></A><BR>Essayed to stay his hand and comfort him
<A NAME="41"></A><BR>With many pleadings.  But he would not cease
<A NAME="42"></A><BR>From grieving: yea, his hands had spilt his life
<A NAME="43"></A><BR>There on his noble brother's new-made tomb,
<A NAME="44"></A><BR>But Nestor heard thereof, and sorrowed sore
<A NAME="45"></A><BR>In his affliction, and he came on him
<A NAME="46"></A><BR>As now he flung him on that woeful grave,
<A NAME="47"></A><BR>And now was casting dust upon his head,
<A NAME="48"></A><BR>Beating his breast, and on his brother's name
<A NAME="49"></A><BR>Crying, while thralls and comrades round their lord
<A NAME="50"></A><BR>Groaned, and affliction held them one and all.
<A NAME="51"></A><BR>Then gently spake he to that stricken one:
<A NAME="52"></A><BR>"Refrain from bitter moan and deadly grief,
<A NAME="53"></A><BR>My son.  It is not for a wise man's honour
<A NAME="54"></A><BR>To wail, as doth a woman, o'er the fallen.
<A NAME="55"></A><BR>Thou shalt not bring him up to light again
<A NAME="56"></A><BR>Whose soul hath fleeted vanishing into air,
<A NAME="57"></A><BR>Whose body fire hath ravined up, whose bones
<A NAME="58"></A><BR>Earth has received.  His end was worthy his life.
<A NAME="59"></A><BR>Endure thy sore grief, even as I endured,
<A NAME="60"></A><BR>Who lost a son, slain by the hands of foes,
<A NAME="61"></A><BR>A son not worse than thy Machaon, good
<A NAME="62"></A><BR>With spears in battle, good in counsel.  None
<A NAME="63"></A><BR>Of all the youths so loved his sire as he
<A NAME="64"></A><BR>Loved me.  He died for me yea, died to save
<A NAME="65"></A><BR>His father.  Yet, when he was slain, did I
<A NAME="66"></A><BR>Endure to taste food, and to see the light,
<A NAME="67"></A><BR>Well knowing that all men must tread one path
<A NAME="68"></A><BR>Hades-ward, and before all lies one goal,
<A NAME="69"></A><BR>Death's mournful goal.  A mortal man must bear
<A NAME="70"></A><BR>All joys, all griefs, that God vouchsafes to send."
<A NAME="71"></A><BR><BR>Made answer that heart-stricken one, while still
<A NAME="72"></A><BR>Wet were his cheeks with ever-flowing tears:
<A NAME="73"></A><BR>"Father, mine heart is bowed 'neath crushing grief
<A NAME="74"></A><BR>For a brother passing wise, who fostered me
<A NAME="75"></A><BR>Even as a son.  When to the heavens had passed
<A NAME="76"></A><BR>Our father, in his arms he cradled me:
<A NAME="77"></A><BR>Gladly he taught me all his healing lore;
<A NAME="78"></A><BR>We shared one table; in one bed we lay:
<A NAME="79"></A><BR>We had all things in common these, and love.
<A NAME="80"></A><BR>My grief cannot forget, nor I desire,
<A NAME="81"></A><BR>Now he is dead, to see the light of life."
<A NAME="82"></A><BR><BR>Then spake the old man to that stricken one:
<A NAME="83"></A><BR>"To all men Fate assigns one same sad lot,
<A NAME="84"></A><BR>Bereavement: earth shall cover all alike,
<A NAME="85"></A><BR>Albeit we tread not the same path of life,
<A NAME="86"></A><BR>And none the path he chooseth; for on high
<A NAME="87"></A><BR>Good things and bad lie on the knees of
<A NAME="88"></A><BR>Gods Unnumbered, indistinguishably blent.
<A NAME="89"></A><BR>These no Immortal seeth; they are veiled
<A NAME="90"></A><BR>In mystic cloud-folds.  Only Fate puts forth
<A NAME="91"></A><BR>Her hands thereto, nor looks at what she takes,
<A NAME="92"></A><BR>But casts them from Olympus down to earth.
<A NAME="93"></A><BR>This way and that they are wafted, as it were
<A NAME="94"></A><BR>By gusts of wind.  The good man oft is whelmed
<A NAME="95"></A><BR>In suffering: wealth undeserved is heaped
<A NAME="96"></A><BR>On the vile person.  Blind is each man's life;
<A NAME="97"></A><BR>Therefore he never walketh surely; oft
<A NAME="98"></A><BR>He stumbleth: ever devious is his path,
<A NAME="99"></A><BR>Now sloping down to sorrow, mounting now
<A NAME="100"></A><BR>To bliss.  All-happy is no living man
<A NAME="101"></A><BR>From the beginning to the end, but still
<A NAME="102"></A><BR>The good and evil clash.  Our life is short;
<A NAME="103"></A><BR>Beseems not then in grief to live.  Hope on,
<A NAME="104"></A><BR>Still hope for better days: chain not to woe
<A NAME="105"></A><BR>Thine heart.  There is a saying among men
<A NAME="106"></A><BR>That to the heavens unperishing mount the souls
<A NAME="107"></A><BR>Of good men, and to nether darkness sink
<A NAME="108"></A><BR>Souls of the wicked.  Both to God and man
<A NAME="109"></A><BR>Dear was thy brother, good to brother-men,
<A NAME="110"></A><BR>And son of an Immortal.  Sure am I
<A NAME="111"></A><BR>That to the company of Gods shall he
<A NAME="112"></A><BR>Ascend, by intercession of thy sire."
<A NAME="113"></A><BR><BR>Then raised he that reluctant mourner up
<A NAME="114"></A><BR>With comfortable words.  From that dark grave
<A NAME="115"></A><BR>He drew him, backward gazing oft with groans.
<A NAME="116"></A><BR>To the ships they came, where Greeks and Trojan 
<A NAME="117"></A>men
<A NAME="118"></A><BR>Had bitter travail of rekindled war.
<A NAME="119"></A><BR><BR>Eurypylus there, in dauntless spirit like
<A NAME="120"></A><BR>The War-god, with mad-raging spear and hands
<A NAME="121"></A><BR>Resistless, smote down hosts of foes: the earth
<A NAME="122"></A><BR>Was clogged with dead men slain on either side.
<A NAME="123"></A><BR>On strode he midst the corpses, awelessly
<A NAME="124"></A><BR>He fought, with blood-bespattered hands and feet;
<A NAME="125"></A><BR>Never a moment from grim strife he ceased.
<A NAME="126"></A><BR>Peneleos the mighty-hearted came
<A NAME="127"></A><BR>Against him in the pitiless fray: he fell
<A NAME="128"></A><BR>Before Eurypylus' spear: yea, many more
<A NAME="129"></A><BR>Fell round him.  Ceased not those destroying hands,
<A NAME="130"></A><BR>But wrathful on the Argives still he pressed,
<A NAME="131"></A><BR>As when of old on Pholoe's long-ridged heights
<A NAME="132"></A><BR>Upon the Centaurs terrible Hercules rushed
<A NAME="133"></A><BR>Storming in might, and slew them, passing-swift
<A NAME="134"></A><BR>And strong and battle-cunning though they were;
<A NAME="135"></A><BR>So rushed he on, so smote he down the array,
<A NAME="136"></A><BR>One after other, of the Danaan spears.
<A NAME="137"></A><BR>Heaps upon heaps, here, there, in throngs they fell
<A NAME="138"></A><BR>Strewn in the dust.  As when a river in flood
<A NAME="139"></A><BR>Comes thundering down, banks crumble on either side
<A NAME="140"></A><BR>To drifting sand: on seaward rolls the surge
<A NAME="141"></A><BR>Tossing wild crests, while cliffs on every hand
<A NAME="142"></A><BR>Ring crashing echoes, as their brows break down
<A NAME="143"></A><BR>Beneath long-leaping roaring waterfalls,
<A NAME="144"></A><BR>And dikes are swept away; so fell in dust
<A NAME="145"></A><BR>The war-famed Argives by Eurypylus slain,
<A NAME="146"></A><BR>Such as he overtook in that red rout.
<A NAME="147"></A><BR>Some few escaped, whom strength of fleeing feet
<A NAME="148"></A><BR>Delivered.  Yet in that sore strait they drew
<A NAME="149"></A><BR>Peneleos from the shrieking tumult forth,
<A NAME="150"></A><BR>And bare to the ships, though with swift feet themselves
<A NAME="151"></A><BR>Were fleeing from ghastly death, from pitiless doom.
<A NAME="152"></A><BR>Behind the rampart of the ships they fled
<A NAME="153"></A><BR>In huddled rout: they had no heart to stand
<A NAME="154"></A><BR>Before Eurypylus, for Hercules,
<A NAME="155"></A><BR>To crown with glory his son's stalwart son,
<A NAME="156"></A><BR>Thrilled them with panic.  There behind their wall
<A NAME="157"></A><BR>They cowered, as goats to leeward of a hill
<A NAME="158"></A><BR>Shrink from the wild cold rushing of the wind
<A NAME="159"></A><BR>That bringeth snow and heavy sleet and haft.
<A NAME="160"></A><BR>No longing for the pasture tempteth them
<A NAME="161"></A><BR>Over the brow to step, and face the blast,
<A NAME="162"></A><BR>But huddling screened by rock-wall and ravine
<A NAME="163"></A><BR>They abide the storm, and crop the scanty grass
<A NAME="164"></A><BR>Under dim copses thronging, till the gusts
<A NAME="165"></A><BR>Of that ill wind shall lull: so, by their towers
<A NAME="166"></A><BR>Screened, did the trembling Danaans abide
<A NAME="167"></A><BR>Telephus' mighty son.  Yea, he had burnt
<A NAME="168"></A><BR>The ships, and all that host had he destroyed,
<A NAME="169"></A><BR>Had not Athena at the last inspired
<A NAME="170"></A><BR>The Argive men with courage.  Ceaselessly
<A NAME="171"></A><BR>From the high rampart hurled they at the foe
<A NAME="172"></A><BR>With bitter-biting darts, and slew them fast;
<A NAME="173"></A><BR>And all the walls were splashed with reeking gore,
<A NAME="174"></A><BR>And aye went up a moan of smitten men.
<A NAME="175"></A><BR><BR>So fought they: nightlong, daylong fought they 
<A NAME="176"></A>on,
<A NAME="177"></A><BR>Ceteians, Trojans, battle-biding Greeks,
<A NAME="178"></A><BR>Fought, now before the ships, and now again
<A NAME="179"></A><BR>Round the steep wall, with fury unutterable.
<A NAME="180"></A><BR>Yet even so for two days did they cease
<A NAME="181"></A><BR>From murderous fight; for to Eurypylus came
<A NAME="182"></A><BR>A Danaan embassage, saying, "From the war
<A NAME="183"></A><BR>Forbear we, while we give unto the flames
<A NAME="184"></A><BR>The battle-slain."  So hearkened he to them:
<A NAME="185"></A><BR>From ruin-wreaking strife forebore the hosts;
<A NAME="186"></A><BR>And so their dead they buried, who in dust
<A NAME="187"></A><BR>Had fallen.  Chiefly the Achaeans mourned
<A NAME="188"></A><BR>Peneleos; o'er the mighty dead they heaped
<A NAME="189"></A><BR>A barrow broad and high, a sign for men
<A NAME="190"></A><BR>Of days to be.  But in a several place
<A NAME="191"></A><BR>The multitude of heroes slain they laid,
<A NAME="192"></A><BR>Mourning with stricken hearts.  On one great pyre
<A NAME="193"></A><BR>They burnt them all, and buried in one grave.
<A NAME="194"></A><BR>So likewise far from thence the sons of Troy
<A NAME="195"></A><BR>Buried their slain.  Yet murderous Strife slept 
<A NAME="196"></A>not,
<A NAME="197"></A><BR>But roused again Eurypylus' dauntless might
<A NAME="198"></A><BR>To meet the foe.  He turned not from the ships,
<A NAME="199"></A><BR>But there abode, and fanned the fury of war.
<A NAME="200"></A><BR><BR>Meanwhile the black ship on to Scyros ran;
<A NAME="201"></A><BR>And those twain found before his palace-gate
<A NAME="202"></A><BR>Achilles' son, now hurling dart and lance,
<A NAME="203"></A><BR>Now in his chariot driving fleetfoot steeds.
<A NAME="204"></A><BR>Glad were they to behold him practising
<A NAME="205"></A><BR>The deeds of war, albeit his heart was sad
<A NAME="206"></A><BR>For his slain sire, of whom had tidings come
<A NAME="207"></A><BR>Ere this.  With reverent eyes of awe they went
<A NAME="208"></A><BR>To meet him, for that goodly form and face
<A NAME="209"></A><BR>Seemed even as very Achilles unto them.
<A NAME="210"></A><BR>But he, or ever they had spoken, cried:
<A NAME="211"></A><BR>"All hail, ye strangers, unto this mine home
<A NAME="212"></A><BR>Say whence ye are, and who, and what the need
<A NAME="213"></A><BR>That hither brings you over barren seas."
<A NAME="214"></A><BR><BR>So spake he, and Odysseus answered him:
<A NAME="215"></A><BR>"Friends are we of Achilles lord of war,
<A NAME="216"></A><BR>To whom of Deidameia thou wast born --
<A NAME="217"></A><BR>Yea, when we look on thee we seem to see
<A NAME="218"></A><BR>That Hero's self; and like the Immortal Ones
<A NAME="219"></A><BR>Was he.  Of Ithaca am I: this man
<A NAME="220"></A><BR>Of Argos, nurse of horses -- if perchance
<A NAME="221"></A><BR>Thou hast heard the name of Tydeus' warrior son
<A NAME="222"></A><BR>Or of the wise Odysseus.  Lo, I stand
<A NAME="223"></A><BR>Before thee, sent by voice of prophecy.
<A NAME="224"></A><BR>I pray thee, pity us: come thou to Troy
<A NAME="225"></A><BR>And help us.  Only so unto the war
<A NAME="226"></A><BR>An end shall be.  Gifts beyond words to thee
<A NAME="227"></A><BR>The Achaean kings shall give: yea, I myself
<A NAME="228"></A><BR>Will give to thee thy godlike father's arms,
<A NAME="229"></A><BR>And great shall be thy joy in bearing them;
<A NAME="230"></A><BR>For these be like no mortal's battle-gear,
<A NAME="231"></A><BR>But splendid as the very War-god's arms.
<A NAME="232"></A><BR>Over their marvellous blazonry hath gold
<A NAME="233"></A><BR>Been lavished; yea, in heaven Hephaestus' self
<A NAME="234"></A><BR>Rejoiced in fashioning that work divine,
<A NAME="235"></A><BR>The which thine eyes shall marvel to behold;
<A NAME="236"></A><BR>For earth and heaven and sea upon the shield
<A NAME="237"></A><BR>Are wrought, and in its wondrous compass are
<A NAME="238"></A><BR>Creatures that seem to live and move -- a wonder
<A NAME="239"></A><BR>Even to the Immortals.  Never man
<A NAME="240"></A><BR>Hath seen their like, nor any man hath worn,
<A NAME="241"></A><BR>Save thy sire only, whom the Achaeans all
<A NAME="242"></A><BR>Honoured as Zeus himself.  I chiefliest
<A NAME="243"></A><BR>From mine heart loved him, and when he was slain,
<A NAME="244"></A><BR>To many a foe I dealt a ruthless doom,
<A NAME="245"></A><BR>And through them all bare back to the ships his 
<A NAME="246"></A>corse.
<A NAME="247"></A><BR>Therefore his glorious arms did Thetis give
<A NAME="248"></A><BR>To me.  These, though I prize them well, to thee
<A NAME="249"></A><BR>Will I give gladly when thou com'st to Troy.
<A NAME="250"></A><BR>Yea also, when we have smitten Priam's towns
<A NAME="251"></A><BR>And unto Hellas in our ships return,
<A NAME="252"></A><BR>Shall Menelaus give thee, an thou wilt,
<A NAME="253"></A><BR>His princess-child to wife, of love for thee,
<A NAME="254"></A><BR>And with his bright-haired daughter shall bestow
<A NAME="255"></A><BR>Rich dower of gold and treasure, even all
<A NAME="256"></A><BR>That meet is to attend a wealthy king."
<A NAME="257"></A><BR><BR>So spake he, and replied Achilles' son:
<A NAME="258"></A><BR>"If bidden of oracles the Achaean men
<A NAME="259"></A><BR>Summon me, let us with to-morrow's dawn
<A NAME="260"></A><BR>Fare forth upon the broad depths of the sea,
<A NAME="261"></A><BR>If so to longing Danaans I may prove
<A NAME="262"></A><BR>A light of help.  Now pass we to mine halls,
<A NAME="263"></A><BR>And to such guest-fare as befits to set
<A NAME="264"></A><BR>Before the stranger.  For my marriage-day --
<A NAME="265"></A><BR>To this the Gods in time to come shall see."
<A NAME="266"></A><BR><BR>Then hall-ward led he them, and with glad hearts
<A NAME="267"></A><BR>They followed.  To the forecourt when they came
<A NAME="268"></A><BR>Of that great mansion, found they there the Queen
<A NAME="269"></A><BR>Deidameia in her sorrow of soul
<A NAME="270"></A><BR>Grief-wasted, as when snow from mountain-sides
<A NAME="271"></A><BR>Before the sun and east-wind wastes away;
<A NAME="272"></A><BR>So pined she for that princely hero slain.
<A NAME="273"></A><BR>Then came to her amidst her grief the kings,
<A NAME="274"></A><BR>And greeted her in courteous wise.  Her son
<A NAME="275"></A><BR>Drew near and told their lineage and their names;
<A NAME="276"></A><BR>But that for which they came he left untold
<A NAME="277"></A><BR>Until the morrow, lest unto her woe
<A NAME="278"></A><BR>There should be added grief and floods of tears,
<A NAME="279"></A><BR>And lest her prayers should hold him from the path
<A NAME="280"></A><BR>Whereon his heart was set.  Straight feasted these,
<A NAME="281"></A><BR>And comforted their hearts with sleep, even all
<A NAME="282"></A><BR>Which dwelt in sea-ringed Scyros, nightlong lulled
<A NAME="283"></A><BR>By long low thunder of the girdling deep,
<A NAME="284"></A><BR>Of waves Aegean breaking on her shores.
<A NAME="285"></A><BR>But not on Deidameia fell the hands
<A NAME="286"></A><BR>Of kindly sleep.  She bore in mind the names
<A NAME="287"></A><BR>Of crafty Odysseus and of Diomede
<A NAME="288"></A><BR>The godlike, how these twain had widowed her
<A NAME="289"></A><BR>Of battle-fain Achilles, how their words
<A NAME="290"></A><BR>Had won his aweless heart to fare with them
<A NAME="291"></A><BR>To meet the war-cry where stern Fate met him,
<A NAME="292"></A><BR>Shattered his hope of home-return, and laid
<A NAME="293"></A><BR>Measureless grief on Peleus and on her.
<A NAME="294"></A><BR>Therefore an awful dread oppressed her soul
<A NAME="295"></A><BR>Lest her son too to tumult of the war
<A NAME="296"></A><BR>Should speed, and grief be added to her grief.
<A NAME="297"></A><BR><BR>Dawn climbed the wide-arched heaven, straightway 
<A NAME="298"></A>they
<A NAME="299"></A><BR>Rose from their beds.  Then Deidameia knew;
<A NAME="300"></A><BR>And on her son's broad breast she cast herself,
<A NAME="301"></A><BR>And bitterly wailed: her cry thrilled through the 
<A NAME="302"></A>air,
<A NAME="303"></A><BR>As when a cow loud-lowing mid the hills
<A NAME="304"></A><BR>Seeks through the glens her calf, and all around
<A NAME="305"></A><BR>Echo long ridges of the mountain-steep;
<A NAME="306"></A><BR>So on all sides from dim recesses rang
<A NAME="307"></A><BR>The hall; and in her misery she cried:
<A NAME="308"></A><BR>"Child, wherefore is thy soul now on the wing
<A NAME="309"></A><BR>To follow strangers unto Ilium
<A NAME="310"></A><BR>The fount of tears, where perish many in fight,
<A NAME="311"></A><BR>Yea, cunning men in war and battle grim?
<A NAME="312"></A><BR>And thou art but a youth, and hast not learnt
<A NAME="313"></A><BR>The ways of war, which save men in the day
<A NAME="314"></A><BR>Of peril.  Hearken thou to me, abide
<A NAME="315"></A><BR>Here in thine home, lest evil tidings come
<A NAME="316"></A><BR>From Troy unto my ears, that thou in fight
<A NAME="317"></A><BR>Hast perished; for mine heart saith, never thou
<A NAME="318"></A><BR>Hitherward shalt from battle-toil return.
<A NAME="319"></A><BR>Not even thy sire escaped the doom of death --
<A NAME="320"></A><BR>He, mightier than thou, mightier than all
<A NAME="321"></A><BR>Heroes on earth, yea, and a Goddess' son --
<A NAME="322"></A><BR>But was in battle slain, all through the wiles
<A NAME="323"></A><BR>And crafty counsels of these very men
<A NAME="324"></A><BR>Who now to woeful war be kindling thee.
<A NAME="325"></A><BR>Therefore mine heart is full of shuddering fear
<A NAME="326"></A><BR>Lest, son, my lot should be to live bereaved
<A NAME="327"></A><BR>Of thee, and to endure dishonour and pain,
<A NAME="328"></A><BR>For never heavier blow on woman falls
<A NAME="329"></A><BR>Than when her lord hath perished, and her sons
<A NAME="330"></A><BR>Die also, and her house is left to her
<A NAME="331"></A><BR>Desolate.  Straightway evil men remove
<A NAME="332"></A><BR>Her landmarks, yea, and rob her of her all,
<A NAME="333"></A><BR>Setting the right at naught.  There is no lot
<A NAME="334"></A><BR>More woeful and more helpless than is hers
<A NAME="335"></A><BR>Who is left a widow in a desolate home."
<A NAME="336"></A><BR><BR>Loud-wailing spake she; but her son replied:
<A NAME="337"></A><BR>"Be of good cheer, my mother; put from thee
<A NAME="338"></A><BR>Evil foreboding.  No man is in war
<A NAME="339"></A><BR>Beyond his destiny slain.  If my weird be
<A NAME="340"></A><BR>To die in my country's cause, then let me die
<A NAME="341"></A><BR>When I have done deeds worthy of my sire."
<A NAME="342"></A><BR><BR>Then to his side old Lycomedes came,
<A NAME="343"></A><BR>And to his battle-eager grandson spake:
<A NAME="344"></A><BR>"O valiant-hearted son, so like thy sire,
<A NAME="345"></A><BR>I know thee strong and valorous; yet, O yet
<A NAME="346"></A><BR>For thee I fear the bitter war; I fear
<A NAME="347"></A><BR>The terrible sea-surge.  Shipmen evermore
<A NAME="348"></A><BR>Hang on destruction's brink.  Beware, my child,
<A NAME="349"></A><BR>Perils of waters when thou sailest back
<A NAME="350"></A><BR>From Troy or other shores, such as beset
<A NAME="351"></A><BR>Full oftentimes the voyagers that ride
<A NAME="352"></A><BR>The long sea-ridges, when the sun hath left
<A NAME="353"></A><BR>The Archer-star, and meets the misty Goat,
<A NAME="354"></A><BR>When the wild blasts drive on the lowering storm,
<A NAME="355"></A><BR>Or when Orion to the darkling west
<A NAME="356"></A><BR>Slopes, into Ocean's river sinking slow.
<A NAME="357"></A><BR>Beware the time of equal days and nights,
<A NAME="358"></A><BR>When blasts that o'er the sea's abysses rush,
<A NAME="359"></A><BR>None knoweth whence in fury of battle clash.
<A NAME="360"></A><BR>Beware the Pleiads' setting, when the sea
<A NAME="361"></A><BR>Maddens beneath their power nor these alone,
<A NAME="362"></A><BR>But other stars, terrors of hapless men,
<A NAME="363"></A><BR>As o'er the wide sea-gulf they set or rise."
<A NAME="364"></A><BR><BR>Then kissed he him, nor sought to stay the feet
<A NAME="365"></A><BR>Of him who panted for the clamour of war,
<A NAME="366"></A><BR>Who smiled for pleasure and for eagerness
<A NAME="367"></A><BR>To haste to the ship.  Yet were his hurrying feet
<A NAME="368"></A><BR>Stayed by his mother's pleading and her tears
<A NAME="369"></A><BR>Still in those halls awhile.  As some swift horse
<A NAME="370"></A><BR>Is reined in by his rider, when he strains
<A NAME="371"></A><BR>Unto the race-course, and he neighs, and champs
<A NAME="372"></A><BR>The curbing bit, dashing his chest with foam,
<A NAME="373"></A><BR>And his feet eager for the course are still
<A NAME="374"></A><BR>Never, his restless hooves are clattering aye;
<A NAME="375"></A><BR>His mane is a stormy cloud, he tosses high
<A NAME="376"></A><BR>His head with snortings, and his lord is glad;
<A NAME="377"></A><BR>So reined his mother back the glorious son
<A NAME="378"></A><BR>Of battle-stay Achilles, so his feet
<A NAME="379"></A><BR>Were restless, so the mother's loving pride
<A NAME="380"></A><BR>Joyed in her son, despite her heart-sick pain.
<A NAME="381"></A><BR><BR>A thousand times he kissed her, then at last
<A NAME="382"></A><BR>Left her alone with her own grief and moan
<A NAME="383"></A><BR>There in her father's halls.  As o'er her nest
<A NAME="384"></A><BR>A swallow in her anguish cries aloud
<A NAME="385"></A><BR>For her lost nestlings which, mid piteous shrieks,
<A NAME="386"></A><BR>A fearful serpent hath devoured, and wrung
<A NAME="387"></A><BR>The loving mother's heart; and now above
<A NAME="388"></A><BR>That empty cradle spreads her wings, and now
<A NAME="389"></A><BR>Flies round its porchway fashioned cunningly
<A NAME="390"></A><BR>Lamenting piteously her little ones:
<A NAME="391"></A><BR>So for her child Deidameia mourned.
<A NAME="392"></A><BR>Now on her son's bed did she cast herself,
<A NAME="393"></A><BR>Crying aloud, against his door-post now
<A NAME="394"></A><BR>She leaned, and wept: now laid she in her lap
<A NAME="395"></A><BR>Those childhood's toys yet treasured in her bower,
<A NAME="396"></A><BR>Wherein his babe-heart joyed long years agone.
<A NAME="397"></A><BR>She saw a dart there left behind of him,
<A NAME="398"></A><BR>And kissed it o'er and o'er yea, whatso else
<A NAME="399"></A><BR>Her weeping eyes beheld that was her son's.
<A NAME="400"></A><BR><BR>Naught heard he of her moans unutterable,
<A NAME="401"></A><BR>But was afar, fast striding to the ship.
<A NAME="402"></A><BR>He seemed, as his feet swiftly bare him on,
<A NAME="403"></A><BR>Like some all-radiant star; and at his side
<A NAME="404"></A><BR>With Tydeus' son war-wise Odysseus went,
<A NAME="405"></A><BR>And with them twenty gallant-hearted men,
<A NAME="406"></A><BR>Whom Deidameia chose as trustiest
<A NAME="407"></A><BR>Of all her household, and unto her son
<A NAME="408"></A><BR>Gave them for henchmen swift to do his will.
<A NAME="409"></A><BR>And these attended Achilles' valiant son,
<A NAME="410"></A><BR>As through the city to the ship he sped.
<A NAME="411"></A><BR>On, with glad laughter, in their midst he strode;
<A NAME="412"></A><BR>And Thetis and the Nereids joyed thereat.
<A NAME="413"></A><BR>Yea, glad was even the Raven-haired, the Lord
<A NAME="414"></A><BR>Of all the sea, beholding that brave son
<A NAME="415"></A><BR>Of princely Achilles, marking how he longed
<A NAME="416"></A><BR>For battle.  Beardless boy albeit he was,
<A NAME="417"></A><BR>His prowess and his might were inward spurs
<A NAME="418"></A><BR>To him.  He hasted forth his fatherland
<A NAME="419"></A><BR>Like to the War-god, when to gory strife
<A NAME="420"></A><BR>He speedeth, wroth with foes, when maddeneth
<A NAME="421"></A><BR>His heart, and grim his frown is, and his eyes
<A NAME="422"></A><BR>Flash levin-flame around him, and his face
<A NAME="423"></A><BR>Is clothed with glory of beauty terror-blent,
<A NAME="424"></A><BR>As on he rusheth: quail the very Gods.
<A NAME="425"></A><BR>So seemed Achilles' goodly son; and prayers
<A NAME="426"></A><BR>Went up through all the city unto Heaven
<A NAME="427"></A><BR>To bring their noble prince safe back from war;
<A NAME="428"></A><BR>And the Gods hearkened to them.  High he towered
<A NAME="429"></A><BR>Above all stateliest men which followed him.
<A NAME="430"></A><BR><BR>So came they to the heavy-plunging sea,
<A NAME="431"></A><BR>And found the rowers in the smooth-wrought ship
<A NAME="432"></A><BR>Handling the tackle, fixing mast and sail.
<A NAME="433"></A><BR>Straightway they went aboard: the shipmen cast
<A NAME="434"></A><BR>The hawsers loose, and heaved the anchor-stones,
<A NAME="435"></A><BR>The strength and stay of ships in time of need.
<A NAME="436"></A><BR>Then did the Sea-queen's lord grant voyage fair
<A NAME="437"></A><BR>To these with gracious mind; for his heart yearned
<A NAME="438"></A><BR>O'er the Achaeans, by the Trojan men
<A NAME="439"></A><BR>And mighty-souled Eurypylus hard-bestead.
<A NAME="440"></A><BR>On either side of Neoptolemus sat
<A NAME="441"></A><BR>Those heroes, gladdening his soul with tales
<A NAME="442"></A><BR>Of his sire's mighty deeds -- of all he wrought
<A NAME="443"></A><BR>In sea-raids, and in valiant Telephus' land,
<A NAME="444"></A><BR>And how he smote round Priam's burg the men
<A NAME="445"></A><BR>Of Troy, for glory unto Atreus' sons.
<A NAME="446"></A><BR>His heart glowed, fain to grasp his heritage,
<A NAME="447"></A><BR>His aweless father's honour and renown.
<A NAME="448"></A><BR><BR>In her bower, sorrowing for her son the while,
<A NAME="449"></A><BR>Deidameia poured forth sighs and tears.
<A NAME="450"></A><BR>With agony of soul her very heart
<A NAME="451"></A><BR>Melted in her, as over coals doth lead
<A NAME="452"></A><BR>Or wax, and never did her moaning cease,
<A NAME="453"></A><BR>As o'er the wide sea her gaze followed him.
<A NAME="454"></A><BR>Ay, for her son a mother fretteth still,
<A NAME="455"></A><BR>Though it be to a feast that he hath gone,
<A NAME="456"></A><BR>By a friend bidden forth.  But soon the sail
<A NAME="457"></A><BR>Of that good ship far-fleeting o'er the blue
<A NAME="458"></A><BR>Grew faint and fainter -- melted in sea-haze.
<A NAME="459"></A><BR>But still she sighed, still daylong made her moan.
<A NAME="460"></A><BR><BR>On ran the ship before a following wind,
<A NAME="461"></A><BR>Seeming to skim the myriad-surging sea,
<A NAME="462"></A><BR>And crashed the dark wave either side the prow:
<A NAME="463"></A><BR>Swiftly across the abyss unplumbed she sped.
<A NAME="464"></A><BR>Night's darkness fell about her, but the breeze
<A NAME="465"></A><BR>Held, and the steersman's hand was sure.  O'er gulfs
<A NAME="466"></A><BR>Of brine she flew, till Dawn divine rose up
<A NAME="467"></A><BR>To climb the sky.  Then sighted they the peaks
<A NAME="468"></A><BR>Of Ida, Chrysa next, and Smintheus' fane,
<A NAME="469"></A><BR>Then the Sigean strand, and then the tomb
<A NAME="470"></A><BR>Of Aeacus' son.  Yet would Laertes' seed,
<A NAME="471"></A><BR>The man discreet of soul, not point it out
<A NAME="472"></A><BR>To Neoptolemus, lest the tide of grief
<A NAME="473"></A><BR>Too high should swell within his breast.  They passed
<A NAME="474"></A><BR>Calydnae's isles, left Tenedos behind;
<A NAME="475"></A><BR>And now was seen the fane of Eleus,
<A NAME="476"></A><BR>Where stands Protesilaus' tomb, beneath
<A NAME="477"></A><BR>The shade of towcry elms; when, soaring high
<A NAME="478"></A><BR>Above the plain, their topmost boughs discern
<A NAME="479"></A><BR>Troy, straightway wither all their highest sprays.
<A NAME="480"></A><BR>Nigh Ilium now the ship by wind and oar
<A NAME="481"></A><BR>Was brought: they saw the long strand fringed with 
<A NAME="482"></A>keels
<A NAME="483"></A><BR>Of Argives, who endured sore travail of war
<A NAME="484"></A><BR>Even then about the wall, the which themselves
<A NAME="485"></A><BR>Had reared to screen the ships and men in stress
<A NAME="486"></A><BR>Of battle.  Even now Eurypylus' hands
<A NAME="487"></A><BR>To earth were like to dash it and destroy;
<A NAME="488"></A><BR>But the quick eyes of Tydeus' strong son marked
<A NAME="489"></A><BR>How rained the darts and stones on that long wall.
<A NAME="490"></A><BR>Forth of the ship he sprang, and shouted loud
<A NAME="491"></A><BR>With all the strength of his undaunted breast:
<A NAME="492"></A><BR>"Friends, on the Argive men is heaped this day
<A NAME="493"></A><BR>Sore travail!  Let us don our flashing arms
<A NAME="494"></A><BR>With speed, and to yon battle-turmoil haste.
<A NAME="495"></A><BR>For now upon our towers the warrior sons
<A NAME="496"></A><BR>Of Troy press hard -- yea, haply will they tear
<A NAME="497"></A><BR>The long walls down, and burn the ships with fire,
<A NAME="498"></A><BR>And so the souls that long for home-return
<A NAME="499"></A><BR>Shall win it never; nay, ourselves shall fall
<A NAME="500"></A><BR>Before our due time, and shall lie in graves
<A NAME="501"></A><BR>In Troyland, far from children and from wives."
<A NAME="502"></A><BR><BR>All as one man down from the ship they leapt;
<A NAME="503"></A><BR>For trembling seized on all for that grim sight 
<A NAME="504"></A>--
<A NAME="505"></A><BR>On all save aweless Neoptolemus
<A NAME="506"></A><BR>Whose might was like his father's: lust of war
<A NAME="507"></A><BR>Swept o'er him.  To Odysseus' tent in haste
<A NAME="508"></A><BR>They sped, for close it lay to where the ship
<A NAME="509"></A><BR>Touched land.  About its walls was hung great store
<A NAME="510"></A><BR>Of change of armour, of wise Odysseus some,
<A NAME="511"></A><BR>And rescued some from gallant comrades slain.
<A NAME="512"></A><BR>Then did the brave man put on goodly arms;
<A NAME="513"></A><BR>But they in whose breasts faintlier beat their hearts
<A NAME="514"></A><BR>Must don the worser.  Odysseus stood arrayed
<A NAME="515"></A><BR>In those which came with him from Ithaca:
<A NAME="516"></A><BR>To Diomede he gave fair battle-gear
<A NAME="517"></A><BR>Stripped in time past from mighty Socus slain.
<A NAME="518"></A><BR>But in his father's arms Achilles' son
<A NAME="519"></A><BR>Clad him and lo, he seemed Achilles' self!
<A NAME="520"></A><BR>Light on his limbs and lapping close they lay --
<A NAME="521"></A><BR>So cunning was Hephaestus' workmanship --
<A NAME="522"></A><BR>Which for another had been a giant's arms.
<A NAME="523"></A><BR>The massive helmet cumbered not his brows;
<A NAME="524"></A><BR>Yea, the great Pelian spear-shaft burdened not
<A NAME="525"></A><BR>His hand, but lightly swung he up on high
<A NAME="526"></A><BR>The heavy and tall lance thirsting still for blood.
<A NAME="527"></A><BR><BR>Of many Argives which beheld him then
<A NAME="528"></A><BR>Might none draw nigh to him, how fain soe'er,
<A NAME="529"></A><BR>So fast were they in that grim grapple locked
<A NAME="530"></A><BR>Of the wild war that raged all down the wall.
<A NAME="531"></A><BR>But as when shipmen, under a desolate isle
<A NAME="532"></A><BR>Mid the wide sea by stress of weather bound,
<A NAME="533"></A><BR>Chafe, while afar from men the adverse blasts
<A NAME="534"></A><BR>Prison them many a day; they pace the deck
<A NAME="535"></A><BR>With sinking hearts, while scantier grows their 
<A NAME="536"></A>store
<A NAME="537"></A><BR>Of food; they weary till a fair wind sings;
<A NAME="538"></A><BR>So joyed the Achaean host, which theretofore
<A NAME="539"></A><BR>Were heavy of heart, when Neoptolemus came,
<A NAME="540"></A><BR>Joyed in the hope of breathing-space from toil.
<A NAME="541"></A><BR>Then like the aweless lion's flashed his eyes,
<A NAME="542"></A><BR>Which mid the mountains leaps in furious mood
<A NAME="543"></A><BR>To meet the hunters that draw nigh his cave,
<A NAME="544"></A><BR>Thinking to steal his cubs, there left alone
<A NAME="545"></A><BR>In a dark-shadowed glen but from a height
<A NAME="546"></A><BR>The beast hath spied, and on the spoilers leaps
<A NAME="547"></A><BR>With grim jaws terribly roaring; even so
<A NAME="548"></A><BR>That glorious child of Aeacus' aweless son
<A NAME="549"></A><BR>Against the Trojan warriors burned in wrath.
<A NAME="550"></A><BR>Thither his eagle-swoop descended first
<A NAME="551"></A><BR>Where loudest from the plain uproared the fight,
<A NAME="552"></A><BR>There weakest, he divined, must be the wall,
<A NAME="553"></A><BR>The battlements lowest, since the surge of foes
<A NAME="554"></A><BR>Brake heaviest there.  Charged at his side the rest
<A NAME="555"></A><BR>Breathing the battle-spirit.  There they found
<A NAME="556"></A><BR>Eurypylus mighty of heart and all his men
<A NAME="557"></A><BR>Scaling a tower, exultant in the hope
<A NAME="558"></A><BR>Of tearing down the walls, of slaughtering
<A NAME="559"></A><BR>The Argives in one holocaust.  No mind
<A NAME="560"></A><BR>The Gods had to accomplish their desire!
<A NAME="561"></A><BR>But now Odysseus, Diomede the strong,
<A NAME="562"></A><BR>Leonteus, and Neoptolemus, as a God
<A NAME="563"></A><BR>In strength and beauty, hailed their javelins down,
<A NAME="564"></A><BR>And thrust them from the wall.  As dogs and shepherds
<A NAME="565"></A><BR>By shouting and hard fighting drive away
<A NAME="566"></A><BR>Strong lions from a steading, rushing forth
<A NAME="567"></A><BR>From all sides, and the brutes with glaring eyes
<A NAME="568"></A><BR>Pace to and fro; with savage lust for blood
<A NAME="569"></A><BR>Of calves and kine their jaws are slavering;
<A NAME="570"></A><BR>Yet must their onrush give back from the hounds
<A NAME="571"></A><BR>And fearless onset of the shepherd folk;
<A NAME="572"></A><BR>[So from these new defenders shrank the foe]
<A NAME="573"></A><BR>A little, far as one may hurl a stone
<A NAME="574"></A><BR>Exceeding great; for still Eurypylus
<A NAME="575"></A><BR>Suffered them not to flee far from the ships,
<A NAME="576"></A><BR>But cheered them on to bide the brunt, until
<A NAME="577"></A><BR>The ships be won, and all the Argives slain;
<A NAME="578"></A><BR>For Zeus with measureless might thrilled all his 
<A NAME="579"></A>frame.
<A NAME="580"></A><BR>Then seized he a rugged stone and huge, and leapt
<A NAME="581"></A><BR>And hurled it full against the high-built wall.
<A NAME="582"></A><BR>It crashed, and terribly boomed that rampart steep
<A NAME="583"></A><BR>To its foundations.  Terror gripped the Greeks,
<A NAME="584"></A><BR>As though that wall had crumbled down in dust;
<A NAME="585"></A><BR>Yet from the deadly conflict flinched they not,
<A NAME="586"></A><BR>But stood fast, like to jackals or to wolves
<A NAME="587"></A><BR>Bold robbers of the sheep -- when mid the hills
<A NAME="588"></A><BR>Hunter and hound would drive them forth their caves,
<A NAME="589"></A><BR>Being grimly purposed there to slay their whelps.
<A NAME="590"></A><BR>Yet these, albeit tormented by the darts,
<A NAME="591"></A><BR>Flee not, but for their cubs' sake bide and fight;
<A NAME="592"></A><BR>So for the ships' sake they abode and fought,
<A NAME="593"></A><BR>And for their own lives.  But Eurypylus
<A NAME="594"></A><BR>Afront of all the ships stood, taunting them:
<A NAME="595"></A><BR>"Coward and dastard souls!  no darts of yours
<A NAME="596"></A><BR>Had given me pause, nor thrust back from your ships,
<A NAME="597"></A><BR>Had not your rampart stayed mine onset-rush.
<A NAME="598"></A><BR>Ye are like to dogs, that in a forest flinch
<A NAME="599"></A><BR>Before a lion!  Skulking therewithin
<A NAME="600"></A><BR>Ye are fighting -- nay, are shrinking back from 
<A NAME="601"></A>death!
<A NAME="602"></A><BR>But if ye dare come forth on Trojan ground,
<A NAME="603"></A><BR>As once when ye were eager for the fray,
<A NAME="604"></A><BR>None shall from ghastly death deliver you:
<A NAME="605"></A><BR>Slain by mine hand ye all shall lie in dust!"
<A NAME="606"></A><BR><BR>So did he shout a prophecy unfulfilled,
<A NAME="607"></A><BR>Nor heard Doom's chariot-wheels fast rolling near
<A NAME="608"></A><BR>Bearing swift death at Neoptolemus' hands,
<A NAME="609"></A><BR>Nor saw death gleaming from his glittering spear.
<A NAME="610"></A><BR>Ay, and that hero paused not now from fight,
<A NAME="611"></A><BR>But from the ramparts smote the Trojans aye.
<A NAME="612"></A><BR>From that death leaping from above they quailed
<A NAME="613"></A><BR>In tumult round Eurypylus: deadly fear
<A NAME="614"></A><BR>Gripped all their hearts.  As little children cower
<A NAME="615"></A><BR>About a father's knees when thunder of Zeus
<A NAME="616"></A><BR>Crashes from cloud to cloud, when all the air
<A NAME="617"></A><BR>Shudders and groans, so did the sons of Troy,
<A NAME="618"></A><BR>With those Ceteians round their great king, cower
<A NAME="619"></A><BR>Ever as prince Neoptolemus hurled; for death
<A NAME="620"></A><BR>Rode upon all he cast, and bare his wrath
<A NAME="621"></A><BR>Straight rushing down upon the heads of foes.
<A NAME="622"></A><BR>Now in their hearts those wildered Trojans said
<A NAME="623"></A><BR>That once more they beheld Achilles' self
<A NAME="624"></A><BR>Gigantic in his armour.  Yet they hid
<A NAME="625"></A><BR>That horror in their breasts, lest panic fear
<A NAME="626"></A><BR>Should pass from them to the Ceteian host
<A NAME="627"></A><BR>And king Eurypylus; so on every side
<A NAME="628"></A><BR>They wavered 'twixt the stress of their hard strait
<A NAME="629"></A><BR>And that blood-curdling dread, 'twixt shame and 
<A NAME="630"></A>fear.
<A NAME="631"></A><BR>As when men treading a precipitous path
<A NAME="632"></A><BR>Look up, and see adown the mountain-slope
<A NAME="633"></A><BR>A torrent rushing on them, thundering down
<A NAME="634"></A><BR>The rocks, and dare not meet its clamorous flood,
<A NAME="635"></A><BR>But hurry shuddering on, with death in sight
<A NAME="636"></A><BR>Holding as naught the perils of the path;
<A NAME="637"></A><BR>So stayed the Trojans, spite of their desire
<A NAME="638"></A><BR>[To flee the imminent death that waited them]
<A NAME="639"></A><BR>Beneath the wall.  Godlike Eurypylus
<A NAME="640"></A><BR>Aye cheered them on to fight.  He trusted still
<A NAME="641"></A><BR>That this new mighty foe would weary at last
<A NAME="642"></A><BR>With toil of slaughter; but he wearied not.
<A NAME="643"></A><BR><BR>That desperate battle-travail Pallas saw,
<A NAME="644"></A><BR>And left the halls of Heaven incense-sweet,
<A NAME="645"></A><BR>And flew o'er mountain-crests: her hurrying feet
<A NAME="646"></A><BR>Touched not the earth, borne by the air divine
<A NAME="647"></A><BR>In form of cloud-wreaths, swifter than the wind.
<A NAME="648"></A><BR>She came to Troy, she stayed her feet upon
<A NAME="649"></A><BR>Sigeum's windy ness, she looked forth thence
<A NAME="650"></A><BR>Over the ringing battle of dauntless men,
<A NAME="651"></A><BR>And gave the Achaeans glory.  Achilles' son
<A NAME="652"></A><BR>Beyond the rest was filled with valour and strength
<A NAME="653"></A><BR>Which win renown for men in whom they meet.
<A NAME="654"></A><BR>Peerless was he in both: the blood of Zeus
<A NAME="655"></A><BR>Gave strength; to his father's valour was he heir;
<A NAME="656"></A><BR>So by those towers he smote down many a foe.
<A NAME="657"></A><BR>And as a fisher on the darkling sea,
<A NAME="658"></A><BR>To lure the fish to their destruction, takes
<A NAME="659"></A><BR>Within his boat the strength of fire; his breath
<A NAME="660"></A><BR>Kindles it to a flame, till round the boat
<A NAME="661"></A><BR>Glareth its splendour, and from the black sea
<A NAME="662"></A><BR>Dart up the fish all eager to behold
<A NAME="663"></A><BR>The radiance -- for the last time; for the barbs
<A NAME="664"></A><BR>Of his three-pointed spear, as up they leap,
<A NAME="665"></A><BR>Slay them; his heart rejoices o'er the prey.
<A NAME="666"></A><BR>So that war-king Achilles' glorious son
<A NAME="667"></A><BR>Slew hosts of onward-rushing foes around
<A NAME="668"></A><BR>That wall of stone.  Well fought the Achaeans all,
<A NAME="669"></A><BR>Here, there, adown the ramparts: rang again
<A NAME="670"></A><BR>The wide strand and the ships: the battered walls
<A NAME="671"></A><BR>Groaned ever.  Men with weary ache of toil
<A NAME="672"></A><BR>Fainted on either side; sinews and might
<A NAME="673"></A><BR>Of strong men were unstrung.  But o'er the son
<A NAME="674"></A><BR>Of battle-stay Achilles weariness
<A NAME="675"></A><BR>Crept not: his battle-eager spirit aye
<A NAME="676"></A><BR>Was tireless; never touched by palsying fear
<A NAME="677"></A><BR>He fought on, as with the triumphant strength
<A NAME="678"></A><BR>Of an ever-flowing river: though it roll
<A NAME="679"></A><BR>'Twixt blazing forests, though the madding blast
<A NAME="680"></A><BR>Roll stormy seas of flame, it feareth not,
<A NAME="681"></A><BR>For at its brink faint grows the fervent heat,
<A NAME="682"></A><BR>The strong flood turns its might to impotence;
<A NAME="683"></A><BR>So weariness nor fear could bow the knees
<A NAME="684"></A><BR>Of Hero Achilles' gallant-hearted son,
<A NAME="685"></A><BR>Still as he fought, still cheered his comrades on.
<A NAME="686"></A><BR>Of myriad shafts sped at him none might touch
<A NAME="687"></A><BR>His flesh, but even as snowflakes on a rock
<A NAME="688"></A><BR>Fell vainly ever: wholly screened was he
<A NAME="689"></A><BR>By broad shield and strong helmet, gifts of a God.
<A NAME="690"></A><BR>In these exulting did the Aeacid's son
<A NAME="691"></A><BR>Stride all along the wall, with ringing shouts
<A NAME="692"></A><BR>Cheering the dauntless Argives to the fray,
<A NAME="693"></A><BR>Being their mightiest far, bearing a soul
<A NAME="694"></A><BR>Insatiate of the awful onset-cry,
<A NAME="695"></A><BR>Burning with one strong purpose, to avenge
<A NAME="696"></A><BR>His father's death: the Myrmidons in their king
<A NAME="697"></A><BR>Exulted.  Roared the battle round the wall.
<A NAME="698"></A><BR><BR>Two sons he slew of Meges rich in gold,
<A NAME="699"></A><BR>Scion of Dymas -- sons of high renown,
<A NAME="700"></A><BR>Cunning to hurl the dart, to drive the steed
<A NAME="701"></A><BR>In war, and deftly cast the lance afar,
<A NAME="702"></A><BR>Born at one birth beside Sangarius' banks
<A NAME="703"></A><BR>Of Periboea to him, Celtus one,
<A NAME="704"></A><BR>And Eubius the other.  But not long
<A NAME="705"></A><BR>His boundless wealth enjoyed they, for the
<A NAME="706"></A><BR>Fates Span them a thread of life exceeding brief.
<A NAME="707"></A><BR>As on one day they saw the light, they died
<A NAME="708"></A><BR>On one day by the same hand.  To the heart
<A NAME="709"></A><BR>Of one Neoptolemus sped a javelin; one
<A NAME="710"></A><BR>He smote down with a massy stone that crashed
<A NAME="711"></A><BR>Through his strong helmet, shattered all its ridge,
<A NAME="712"></A><BR>And dashed his brains to earth.  Around them fell
<A NAME="713"></A><BR>Foes many, a host untold.  The War-god's work
<A NAME="714"></A><BR>Waxed ever mightier till the eventide,
<A NAME="715"></A><BR>Till failed the light celestial; then the host
<A NAME="716"></A><BR>Of brave Eurypylus from the ships drew back
<A NAME="717"></A><BR>A little: they that held those leaguered towers
<A NAME="718"></A><BR>Had a short breathing-space; the sons of Troy
<A NAME="719"></A><BR>Had respite from the deadly-echoing strife,
<A NAME="720"></A><BR>From that hard rampart-battle.  Verily all
<A NAME="721"></A><BR>The Argives had beside their ships been slain,
<A NAME="722"></A><BR>Had not Achilles' strong son on that day
<A NAME="723"></A><BR>Withstood the host of foes and their great chief
<A NAME="724"></A><BR>Eurypylus.  Came to that young hero's side
<A NAME="725"></A><BR>Phoenix the old, and marvelling gazed on one
<A NAME="726"></A><BR>The image of Peleides.  Tides of joy
<A NAME="727"></A><BR>And grief swept o'er him --  grief, for memories
<A NAME="728"></A><BR>Of that swift-footed father -- joy, for sight
<A NAME="729"></A><BR>Of such a son.  He for sheer gladness wept;
<A NAME="730"></A><BR>For never without tears the tribes of men
<A NAME="731"></A><BR>Live -- nay, not mid the transports of delight.
<A NAME="732"></A><BR>He clasped him round as father claspeth son
<A NAME="733"></A><BR>Whom, after long and troublous wanderings,
<A NAME="734"></A><BR>The Gods bring home to gladden a father's heart.
<A NAME="735"></A><BR>So kissed he Neoptolemus' head and breast,
<A NAME="736"></A><BR>Clasping him round, and cried in rapture of joy:
<A NAME="737"></A><BR>"Hail, goodly son of that Achilles whom
<A NAME="738"></A><BR>I nursed a little one in mine own arms
<A NAME="739"></A><BR>With a glad heart.  By Heaven's high providence
<A NAME="740"></A><BR>Like a strong sapling waxed he in stature fast,
<A NAME="741"></A><BR>And daily I rejoiced to see his form
<A NAME="742"></A><BR>And prowess, my life's blessing, honouring him
<A NAME="743"></A><BR>As though he were the son of mine old age;
<A NAME="744"></A><BR>For like a father did he honour me.
<A NAME="745"></A><BR>I was indeed his father, he my son
<A NAME="746"></A><BR>In spirit: thou hadst deemed us of one blood
<A NAME="747"></A><BR>Who were in heart one: but of nobler mould
<A NAME="748"></A><BR>Was he by far, in form and strength a God.
<A NAME="749"></A><BR>Thou art wholly like him -- yea, I seem to see
<A NAME="750"></A><BR>Alive amid the Argives him for whom
<A NAME="751"></A><BR>Sharp anguish shrouds me ever.  I waste away
<A NAME="752"></A><BR>In sorrowful age -- oh that the grave had closed
<A NAME="753"></A><BR>On me while yet he lived!  How blest to be
<A NAME="754"></A><BR>By loving hands of kinsmen laid to rest!
<A NAME="755"></A><BR>Ah child, my sorrowing heart will nevermore
<A NAME="756"></A><BR>Forget him!  Chide me not for this my grief.
<A NAME="757"></A><BR>But now, help thou the Myrmidons and Greeks
<A NAME="758"></A><BR>In their sore strait: wreak on the foe thy wrath
<A NAME="759"></A><BR>For thy brave sire.  It shall be thy renown
<A NAME="760"></A><BR>To slay this war-insatiate Telephus' son;
<A NAME="761"></A><BR>For mightier art thou, and shalt prove, than he,
<A NAME="762"></A><BR>As was thy father than his wretched sire."
<A NAME="763"></A><BR><BR>Made answer golden-haired Achilles' son:
<A NAME="764"></A><BR>"Ancient, our battle-prowess mighty Fate
<A NAME="765"></A><BR>And the o'ermastering War-god shall decide."
<A NAME="766"></A><BR><BR>But, as he spake, he had fain on that same day
<A NAME="767"></A><BR>Forth of the gates have rushed in his sire's arms;
<A NAME="768"></A><BR>But night, which bringeth men release from toil,
<A NAME="769"></A><BR>Rose from the ocean veiled in sable pall.
<A NAME="770"></A><BR><BR>With honour as of mighty Achilles' self
<A NAME="771"></A><BR>Him mid the ships the glad Greeks hailed, who had 
<A NAME="772"></A>won
<A NAME="773"></A><BR>Courage from that his eager rush to war.
<A NAME="774"></A><BR>With princely presents did they honour him,
<A NAME="775"></A><BR>With priceless gifts, whereby is wealth increased;
<A NAME="776"></A><BR>For some gave gold and silver, handmaids some,
<A NAME="777"></A><BR>Brass without weight gave these, and iron those;
<A NAME="778"></A><BR>Others in deep jars brought the ruddy wine:
<A NAME="779"></A><BR>Yea, fleetfoot steeds they gave, and battle-gear,
<A NAME="780"></A><BR>And raiment woven fair by women's hands.
<A NAME="781"></A><BR>Glowed Neoptolemus' heart for joy of these.
<A NAME="782"></A><BR>A feast they made for him amidst the tents,
<A NAME="783"></A><BR>And there extolled Achilles' godlike son
<A NAME="784"></A><BR>With praise as of the immortal Heavenly Ones;
<A NAME="785"></A><BR>And joyful-voiced Agamemnon spake to him:
<A NAME="786"></A><BR>"Thou verily art the brave-souled Aeacid's son,
<A NAME="787"></A><BR>His very image thou in stalwart might,
<A NAME="788"></A><BR>In beauty, stature, courage, and in soul.
<A NAME="789"></A><BR>Mine heart burns in me seeing thee.  I trust
<A NAME="790"></A><BR>Thine hands and spear shall smite yon hosts of foes,
<A NAME="791"></A><BR>Shall smite the city of Priam world-renowned --
<A NAME="792"></A><BR>So like thy sire thou art!  Methinks I see
<A NAME="793"></A><BR>Himself beside the ships, as when his shout
<A NAME="794"></A><BR>Of wrath for dead Patroclus shook the ranks
<A NAME="795"></A><BR>Of Troy.  But he is with the Immortal Ones,
<A NAME="796"></A><BR>Yet, bending from that heaven, sends thee to-day
<A NAME="797"></A><BR>To save the Argives on destruction's brink."
<A NAME="798"></A><BR><BR>Answered Achilles' battle-eager son:
<A NAME="799"></A><BR>"Would I might meet him living yet, O King,
<A NAME="800"></A><BR>That so himself might see the son of his love
<A NAME="801"></A><BR>Not shaming his great father's name. I trust
<A NAME="802"></A><BR>So shall it be, if the Gods grant me life."
<A NAME="803"></A><BR><BR>So spake he in wisdom and in modesty;
<A NAME="804"></A><BR>And all there marvelled at the godlike man.
<A NAME="805"></A><BR>But when with meat and wine their hearts were filled,
<A NAME="806"></A><BR>Then rose Achilles' battle-eager son,
<A NAME="807"></A><BR>And from the feast passed forth unto the tent
<A NAME="808"></A><BR>That was his sire's.  Much armour of heroes slain
<A NAME="809"></A><BR>Lay there; and here and there were captive maids
<A NAME="810"></A><BR>Arraying that tent widowed of its lord,
<A NAME="811"></A><BR>As though its king lived.  When that son beheld
<A NAME="812"></A><BR>Those Trojan arms and handmaid-thralls, he groaned,
<A NAME="813"></A><BR>By passionate longing for his father seized.
<A NAME="814"></A><BR>As when through dense oak-groves and tangled glens
<A NAME="815"></A><BR>Comes to the shadowed cave a lion's whelp
<A NAME="816"></A><BR>Whose grim sire by the hunters hath been slain,
<A NAME="817"></A><BR>And looketh all around that empty den,
<A NAME="818"></A><BR>And seeth heaps of bones of steeds and kine
<A NAME="819"></A><BR>Slain theretofore, and grieveth for his sire;
<A NAME="820"></A><BR>Even so the heart of brave Peleides' son
<A NAME="821"></A><BR>With grief was numbed.  The handmaids marvelling 
<A NAME="822"></A>gazed;
<A NAME="823"></A><BR>And fair Briseis' self, when she beheld
<A NAME="824"></A><BR>Achilles' son, was now right glad at heart,
<A NAME="825"></A><BR>And sorrowed now with memories of the dead.
<A NAME="826"></A><BR>Her soul was wildered all, as though indeed
<A NAME="827"></A><BR>There stood the aweless Aeacid living yet.
<A NAME="828"></A><BR><BR>Meanwhile exultant Trojans camped aloof
<A NAME="829"></A><BR>Extolled Eurypylus the fierce and strong,
<A NAME="830"></A><BR>As erst they had praised Hector, when he smote
<A NAME="831"></A><BR>Their foes, defending Troy and all her wealth.
<A NAME="832"></A><BR>But when sweet sleep stole over mortal men,
<A NAME="833"></A><BR>Then sons of Troy and battle-biding Greeks
<A NAME="834"></A><BR>All slumber-heavy slept unsentinelled.
