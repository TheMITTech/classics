<A NAME="10"></A><B>How the Arms of Achilles Were Cause of Madness and Death Unto 
<A NAME="11"></A>Aias</B>
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="12"></A>So when all other contests had an end,
<A NAME="13"></A><BR>Thetis the Goddess laid down in the midst
<A NAME="14"></A><BR>Great-souled Achilles' arms divinely wrought;
<A NAME="15"></A><BR>And all around flashed out the cunning work
<A NAME="16"></A><BR>Wherewith the Fire-god overchased the shield
<A NAME="17"></A><BR>Fashioned for Aeacus' son, the dauntless-souled.
<A NAME="18"></A><BR><BR>Inwrought upon that labour of a God
<A NAME="19"></A><BR>Were first high heaven and cloudland, and beneath
<A NAME="20"></A><BR>Lay earth and sea: the winds, the clouds were there,
<A NAME="21"></A><BR>The moon and sun, each in its several place;
<A NAME="22"></A><BR>There too were all the stars that, fixed in heaven,
<A NAME="23"></A><BR>Are borne in its eternal circlings round.
<A NAME="24"></A><BR>Above and through all was the infinite air
<A NAME="25"></A><BR>Where to and fro flit birds of slender beak:
<A NAME="26"></A><BR>Thou hadst said they lived, and floated on the breeze.
<A NAME="27"></A><BR>Here Tethys' all-embracing arms were wrought,
<A NAME="28"></A><BR>And Ocean's fathomless flow.  The outrushing flood
<A NAME="29"></A><BR>Of rivers crying to the echoing hills
<A NAME="30"></A><BR>All round, to right, to left, rolled o'er the land.
<A NAME="31"></A><BR><BR>Round it rose league-long mountain-ridges, haunts
<A NAME="32"></A><BR>Of terrible lions and foul jackals: there
<A NAME="33"></A><BR>Fierce bears and panthers prowled; with these were 
<A NAME="34"></A>seen
<A NAME="35"></A><BR>Wild boars that whetted deadly-clashing tusks
<A NAME="36"></A><BR>In grimly-frothing jaws.  There hunters sped
<A NAME="37"></A><BR>After the hounds: beaters with stone and dart,
<A NAME="38"></A><BR>To the life portrayed, toiled in the woodland sport.
<A NAME="39"></A><BR><BR>And there were man-devouring wars, and all
<A NAME="40"></A><BR>Horrors of fight: slain men were falling down
<A NAME="41"></A><BR>Mid horse-hoofs; and the likeness of a plain
<A NAME="42"></A><BR>Blood-drenched was on that shield invincible.
<A NAME="43"></A><BR>Panic was there, and Dread, and ghastly Enyo
<A NAME="44"></A><BR>With limbs all gore-bespattered hideously,
<A NAME="45"></A><BR>And deadly Strife, and the Avenging Spirits
<A NAME="46"></A><BR>Fierce-hearted -- she, still goading warriors on
<A NAME="47"></A><BR>To the onset they, outbreathing breath of fire.
<A NAME="48"></A><BR>Around them hovered the relentless Fates;
<A NAME="49"></A><BR>Beside them Battle incarnate onward pressed
<A NAME="50"></A><BR>Yelling, and from their limbs streamed blood and 
<A NAME="51"></A>sweat.
<A NAME="52"></A><BR>There were the ruthless Gorgons: through their hair
<A NAME="53"></A><BR>Horribly serpents coiled with flickering tongues.
<A NAME="54"></A><BR>A measureless marvel was that cunning work
<A NAME="55"></A><BR>Of things that made men shudder to behold
<A NAME="56"></A><BR>Seeming as though they verily lived and moved.
<A NAME="57"></A><BR><BR>And while here all war's marvels were portrayed,
<A NAME="58"></A><BR>Yonder were all the works of lovely peace.
<A NAME="59"></A><BR>The myriad tribes of much-enduring men
<A NAME="60"></A><BR>Dwelt in fair cities.  Justice watched o'er all.
<A NAME="61"></A><BR>To diverse toils they set their hands; the fields
<A NAME="62"></A><BR>Were harvest-laden; earth her increase bore.
<A NAME="63"></A><BR><BR>Most steeply rose on that god-laboured work
<A NAME="64"></A><BR>The rugged flanks of holy Honour's mount,
<A NAME="65"></A><BR>And there upon a palm-tree throned she sat
<A NAME="66"></A><BR>Exalted, and her hands reached up to heaven.
<A NAME="67"></A><BR>All round her, paths broken by many rocks
<A NAME="68"></A><BR>Thwarted the climbers' feet; by those steep tracks
<A NAME="69"></A><BR>Daunted ye saw returning many folk:
<A NAME="70"></A><BR>Few won by sweat of toil the sacred height.
<A NAME="71"></A><BR><BR>And there were reapers moving down long swaths
<A NAME="72"></A><BR>Swinging the whetted sickles: 'neath their hands
<A NAME="73"></A><BR>The hot work sped to its close.  Hard after these
<A NAME="74"></A><BR>Many sheaf-binders followed, and the work
<A NAME="75"></A><BR>Grew passing great.  With yoke-bands on their necks
<A NAME="76"></A><BR>Oxen were there, whereof some drew the wains
<A NAME="77"></A><BR>Heaped high with full-eared sheaves, and further 
<A NAME="78"></A>on
<A NAME="79"></A><BR>Were others ploughing, and the glebe showed black
<A NAME="80"></A><BR>Behind them.  Youths with ever-busy goads
<A NAME="81"></A><BR>Followed: a world of toil was there portrayed.
<A NAME="82"></A><BR><BR>And there a banquet was, with pipe and harp,
<A NAME="83"></A><BR>Dances of maids, and flashing feet of boys,
<A NAME="84"></A><BR>All in swift movement, like to living souls.
<A NAME="85"></A><BR><BR>Hard by the dance and its sweet winsomeness
<A NAME="86"></A><BR>Out of the sea was rising lovely-crowned
<A NAME="87"></A><BR>Cypris, foam-blossoms still upon her hair;
<A NAME="88"></A><BR>And round her hovered smiling witchingly
<A NAME="89"></A><BR>Desire, and danced the Graces lovely-tressed.
<A NAME="90"></A><BR><BR>And there were lordly Nereus' Daughters shown
<A NAME="91"></A><BR>Leading their sister up from the wide sea
<A NAME="92"></A><BR>To her espousals with the warrior-king.
<A NAME="93"></A><BR>And round her all the Immortals banqueted
<A NAME="94"></A><BR>On Pelion's ridge far-stretching.  All about
<A NAME="95"></A><BR>Lush dewy watermeads there were, bestarred
<A NAME="96"></A><BR>With flowers innumerable, grassy groves,
<A NAME="97"></A><BR>And springs with clear transparent water bright.
<A NAME="98"></A><BR><BR>There ships with sighing sheets swept o'er the 
<A NAME="99"></A>sea,
<A NAME="100"></A><BR>Some beating up to windward, some that sped
<A NAME="101"></A><BR>Before a following wind, and round them heaved
<A NAME="102"></A><BR>The melancholy surge.  Seared shipmen rushed
<A NAME="103"></A><BR>This way and that, adread for tempest-gusts,
<A NAME="104"></A><BR>Hauling the white sails in, to 'scape the death 
<A NAME="105"></A>--
<A NAME="106"></A><BR>It all seemed real -- some tugging at the oars,
<A NAME="107"></A><BR>While the dark sea on either side the ship
<A NAME="108"></A><BR>Grew hoary 'neath the swiftly-plashing blades.
<A NAME="109"></A><BR><BR>And there triumphant the Earth-shaker rode
<A NAME="110"></A><BR>Amid sea-monsters' stormy-footed steeds
<A NAME="111"></A><BR>Drew him, and seemed alive, as o'er the deep
<A NAME="112"></A><BR>They raced, oft smitten by the golden whip.
<A NAME="113"></A><BR>Around their path of flight the waves fell smooth,
<A NAME="114"></A><BR>And all before them was unrippled calm.
<A NAME="115"></A><BR>Dolphins on either hand about their king
<A NAME="116"></A><BR>Swarmed, in wild rapture of homage bowing backs,
<A NAME="117"></A><BR>And seemed like live things o'er the hazy sea
<A NAME="118"></A><BR>Swimming, albeit all of silver wrought.
<A NAME="119"></A><BR><BR>Marvels of untold craft were imaged there
<A NAME="120"></A><BR>By cunning-souled Hephaestus' deathless hands
<A NAME="121"></A><BR>Upon the shield.  And Ocean's fathomless flood
<A NAME="122"></A><BR>Clasped like a garland all the outer rim,
<A NAME="123"></A><BR>And compassed all the strong shield's curious work.
<A NAME="124"></A><BR><BR>And therebeside the massy helmet lay.
<A NAME="125"></A><BR>Zeus in his wrath was set upon the crest
<A NAME="126"></A><BR>Throned on heaven's dome; the Immortals all around
<A NAME="127"></A><BR>Fierce-battling with the Titans fought for Zeus.
<A NAME="128"></A><BR>Already were their foes enwrapped with flame,
<A NAME="129"></A><BR>For thick and fast as snowflakes poured from heaven
<A NAME="130"></A><BR>The thunderbolts: the might of Zeus was roused,
<A NAME="131"></A><BR>And burning giants seemed to breathe out flames.
<A NAME="132"></A><BR><BR>And therebeside the fair strong corslet lay,
<A NAME="133"></A><BR>Unpierceable, which clasped Peleides once:
<A NAME="134"></A><BR>There were the greaves close-lapping, light alone
<A NAME="135"></A><BR>To Achilles; massy of mould and huge they were.
<A NAME="136"></A><BR><BR>And hard by flashed the sword whose edge and 
<A NAME="137"></A>point
<A NAME="138"></A><BR>No mail could turn, with golden belt, and sheath
<A NAME="139"></A><BR>Of silver, and with haft of ivory:
<A NAME="140"></A><BR>Brightest amid those wondrous arms it shone.
<A NAME="141"></A><BR>Stretched on the earth thereby was that dread spear,
<A NAME="142"></A><BR>Long as the tall-tressed pines of Pelion,
<A NAME="143"></A><BR>Still breathing out the reek of Hector's blood.
<A NAME="144"></A><BR><BR>Then mid the Argives Thetis sable-stoled
<A NAME="145"></A><BR>In her deep sorrow for Achilles spake;
<A NAME="146"></A><BR>"Now all the athlete-prizes have been won
<A NAME="147"></A><BR>Which I set forth in sorrow for my child.
<A NAME="148"></A><BR>Now let that mightiest of the Argives come
<A NAME="149"></A><BR>Who rescued from the foe my dead: to him
<A NAME="150"></A><BR>These glorious and immortal arms I give
<A NAME="151"></A><BR>Which even the blessed Deathless joyed to see."
<A NAME="152"></A><BR><BR>Then rose in rivalry, each claiming them,
<A NAME="153"></A><BR>Laertes' seed and godlike Telamon's son,
<A NAME="154"></A><BR>Aias, the mightiest far of Danaan men:
<A NAME="155"></A><BR>He seemed the star that in the glittering sky
<A NAME="156"></A><BR>Outshines the host of heaven, Hesperus,
<A NAME="157"></A><BR>So splendid by Peleides' arms he stood;
<A NAME="158"></A><BR>"And let these judge," he cried, "Idomeneus,
<A NAME="159"></A><BR>Nestor, and kingly-counselled Agamemnon,"
<A NAME="160"></A><BR>For these, he weened, would sureliest know the truth
<A NAME="161"></A><BR>Of deeds wrought in that glorious battle-toil.
<A NAME="162"></A><BR>"To these I also trust most utterly,"
<A NAME="163"></A><BR>Odysseus said, "for prudent of their wit
<A NAME="164"></A><BR>Be these, and princeliest of all Danaan men."
<A NAME="165"></A><BR><BR>But to Idomeneus and Atreus' son
<A NAME="166"></A><BR>Spake Nestor apart, and willingly they heard:
<A NAME="167"></A><BR>"Friends, a great woe and unendurable
<A NAME="168"></A><BR>This day the careless Gods have laid on us,
<A NAME="169"></A><BR>In that into this lamentable strife
<A NAME="170"></A><BR>Aias the mighty hath been thrust by them
<A NAME="171"></A><BR>Against Odysseus passing-wise.  For he,
<A NAME="172"></A><BR>To whichsoe'er God gives the victor's glory --
<A NAME="173"></A><BR>O yea, he shall rejoice!  But he that 1oseth --
<A NAME="174"></A><BR>All for the grief in all the Danaans' hearts
<A NAME="175"></A><BR>For him!  And ours shall be the deepest grief
<A NAME="176"></A><BR>Of all; for that man will not in the war
<A NAME="177"></A><BR>Stand by us as of old.  A sorrowful day
<A NAME="178"></A><BR>It shall be for us, whichsoe'er of these
<A NAME="179"></A><BR>Shall break into fierce anger, seeing they
<A NAME="180"></A><BR>Are of our heroes chiefest, this in war,
<A NAME="181"></A><BR>And that in counsel.  Hearken then to me,
<A NAME="182"></A><BR>Seeing that I am older far than ye,
<A NAME="183"></A><BR>Not by a few years only: with mine age
<A NAME="184"></A><BR>Is prudence joined, for I have suffered and wrought
<A NAME="185"></A><BR>Much; and in counsel ever the old man,
<A NAME="186"></A><BR>Who knoweth much, excelleth younger men.
<A NAME="187"></A><BR>Therefore let us ordain to judge this cause
<A NAME="188"></A><BR>'Twixt godlike Aias and war-fain Odysseus,
<A NAME="189"></A><BR>Our Trojan captives.  They shall say whom most
<A NAME="190"></A><BR>Our foes dread, and who saved Peleides' corse
<A NAME="191"></A><BR>From that most deadly fight.  Lo, in our midst
<A NAME="192"></A><BR>Be many spear-won Trojans, thralls of Fate;
<A NAME="193"></A><BR>And these will pass true judgment on these twain,
<A NAME="194"></A><BR>To neither showing favour, since they hate
<A NAME="195"></A><BR>Alike all authors of their misery."
<A NAME="196"></A><BR><BR>He spake: replied Agamemnon lord of spears:
<A NAME="197"></A><BR>"Ancient, there is none other in our midst
<A NAME="198"></A><BR>Wiser than thou, of Danaans young or old,
<A NAME="199"></A><BR>In that thou say'st that unforgiving wrath
<A NAME="200"></A><BR>Will burn in him to whom the Gods herein
<A NAME="201"></A><BR>Deny the victory; for these which strive
<A NAME="202"></A><BR>Are both our chiefest.  Therefore mine heart too
<A NAME="203"></A><BR>Is set on this, that to the thralls of war
<A NAME="204"></A><BR>This judgment we commit: the loser then
<A NAME="205"></A><BR>Shall against Troy devise his deadly work
<A NAME="206"></A><BR>Of vengeance, and shall not be wroth with us."
<A NAME="207"></A><BR><BR>He spake, and these three, being of one mind,
<A NAME="208"></A><BR>In hearing of all men refused to judge
<A NAME="209"></A><BR>Judgment so thankless: they would none of it.
<A NAME="210"></A><BR>Therefore they set the high-born sons of Troy
<A NAME="211"></A><BR>There in the midst, spear-thralls although they 
<A NAME="212"></A>were,
<A NAME="213"></A><BR>To give just judgment in the warriors' strife.
<A NAME="214"></A><BR>Then in hot anger Aias rose, and spake:
<A NAME="215"></A><BR>"Odysseus, frantic soul, why hath a God
<A NAME="216"></A><BR>Deluded thee, to make thee hold thyself
<A NAME="217"></A><BR>My peer in might invincible?  Dar'st thou say
<A NAME="218"></A><BR>That thou, when slain Achilles lay in dust,
<A NAME="219"></A><BR>When round him swarmed the Trojans, didst bear back
<A NAME="220"></A><BR>That furious throng, when I amidst them hurled
<A NAME="221"></A><BR>Death, and thou coweredst away?  Thy dam
<A NAME="222"></A><BR>Bare thee a craven and a weakling wretch
<A NAME="223"></A><BR>Frail in comparison of me, as is
<A NAME="224"></A><BR>A cur beside a lion thunder-voiced!
<A NAME="225"></A><BR>No battle-biding heart is in thy breast,
<A NAME="226"></A><BR>But wiles and treachery be all thy care.
<A NAME="227"></A><BR>Hast thou forgotten how thou didst shrink back
<A NAME="228"></A><BR>From faring with Achaea's gathered host
<A NAME="229"></A><BR>To Ilium's holy burg, till Atreus' sons
<A NAME="230"></A><BR>Forced thee, the cowering craven, how loth soe'er,
<A NAME="231"></A><BR>To follow them -- would God thou hadst never come!
<A NAME="232"></A><BR>For by thy counsel left we in Lemnos' isle
<A NAME="233"></A><BR>Groaning in agony Poeas' son renowned.
<A NAME="234"></A><BR>And not for him alone was ruin devised
<A NAME="235"></A><BR>Of thee; for godlike Palamedes too
<A NAME="236"></A><BR>Didst thou contrive destruction -- ha, he was
<A NAME="237"></A><BR>Alike in battle and council better than thou!
<A NAME="238"></A><BR>And now thou dar'st to rise up against me,
<A NAME="239"></A><BR>Neither remembering my kindness, nor
<A NAME="240"></A><BR>Having respect unto the mightier man
<A NAME="241"></A><BR>Who rescued thee erewhile, when thou didst quaff
<A NAME="242"></A><BR>In fight before the onset of thy foes,
<A NAME="243"></A><BR>When thou, forsaken of all Greeks beside,
<A NAME="244"></A><BR>Midst tumult of the fray, wast fleeing too!
<A NAME="245"></A><BR>Oh that in that great fight Zeus' self had stayed
<A NAME="246"></A><BR>My dauntless might with thunder from his heaven!
<A NAME="247"></A><BR>Then with their two-edged swords the Trojan men
<A NAME="248"></A><BR>Had hewn thee limb from limb, and to their dogs
<A NAME="249"></A><BR>Had cast thy carrion!  Then thou hadst not presumed
<A NAME="250"></A><BR>To meet me, trusting in thy trickeries!
<A NAME="251"></A><BR>Wretch, wherefore, if thou vauntest thee in might
<A NAME="252"></A><BR>Beyond all others, hast thou set thy ships
<A NAME="253"></A><BR>In the line's centre, screened from foes, nor dared
<A NAME="254"></A><BR>As I, on the far wing to draw them up?
<A NAME="255"></A><BR>Because thou wast afraid!  Not thou it was
<A NAME="256"></A><BR>Who savedst from devouring fire the ships;
<A NAME="257"></A><BR>But I with heart unquailing there stood fast
<A NAME="258"></A><BR>Facing the fire and Hector ay, even he
<A NAME="259"></A><BR>Gave back before me everywhere in fight.
<A NAME="260"></A><BR>Thou -- thou didst fear him aye with deadly fear!
<A NAME="261"></A><BR>Oh, had this our contention been but set
<A NAME="262"></A><BR>Amidst that very battle, when the roar
<A NAME="263"></A><BR>Of conflict rose around Achilles slain!
<A NAME="264"></A><BR>Then had thine own eyes seen me bearing forth
<A NAME="265"></A><BR>Out from the battle's heart and fury of foes
<A NAME="266"></A><BR>That goodly armour and its hero lord
<A NAME="267"></A><BR>Unto the tents.  But here thou canst but trust
<A NAME="268"></A><BR>In cunning speech, and covetest a place
<A NAME="269"></A><BR>Amongst the mighty!  Thou -- thou hast not strength
<A NAME="270"></A><BR>To wear Achilles' arms invincible,
<A NAME="271"></A><BR>Nor sway his massy spear in thy weak hands!
<A NAME="272"></A><BR>But I they are verily moulded to my frame:
<A NAME="273"></A><BR>Yea, seemly it is I wear those glorious arms,
<A NAME="274"></A><BR>Who shall not shame a God's gifts passing fair.
<A NAME="275"></A><BR>But wherefore for Achilles' glorious arms
<A NAME="276"></A><BR>With words discourteous wrangling stand we here?
<A NAME="277"></A><BR>Come, let us try in strife with brazen spears
<A NAME="278"></A><BR>Who of us twain is best in murderous right!
<A NAME="279"></A><BR>For silver-footed Thetis set in the midst
<A NAME="280"></A><BR>This prize for prowess, not for pestilent words.
<A NAME="281"></A><BR>In folkmote may men have some use for words:
<A NAME="282"></A><BR>In pride of prowess I know me above thee far,
<A NAME="283"></A><BR>And great Achilles' lineage is mine own."
<A NAME="284"></A><BR><BR>He spake: with scornful glance and bitter speech
<A NAME="285"></A><BR>Odysseus the resourceful chode with him:
<A NAME="286"></A><BR>"Aias, unbridled tongue, why these vain words
<A NAME="287"></A><BR>To me?  Thou hast called me pestilent, niddering,
<A NAME="288"></A><BR>And weakling: yet I boast me better far
<A NAME="289"></A><BR>Than thou in wit and speech, which things increase
<A NAME="290"></A><BR>The strength of men.  Lo, how the craggy rock,
<A NAME="291"></A><BR>Adamantine though it seem, the hewers of stone
<A NAME="292"></A><BR>Amid the hills by wisdom undermine
<A NAME="293"></A><BR>Full lightly, and by wisdom shipmen cross
<A NAME="294"></A><BR>The thunderous-plunging sea, when mountain-high
<A NAME="295"></A><BR>It surgeth, and by craft do hunters quell
<A NAME="296"></A><BR>Strong lions, panthers, boars, yea, all the brood
<A NAME="297"></A><BR>Of wild things.  Furious-hearted bulls are tamed
<A NAME="298"></A><BR>To bear the yoke-bands by device of men.
<A NAME="299"></A><BR>Yea, all things are by wit accomplished.  Still
<A NAME="300"></A><BR>It is the man who knoweth that excels
<A NAME="301"></A><BR>The witless man alike in toils and counsels.
<A NAME="302"></A><BR>For my keen wit did Oeneus' valiant son
<A NAME="303"></A><BR>Choose me of all men with him to draw nigh
<A NAME="304"></A><BR>To Hector's watchmen: yea, and mighty deeds
<A NAME="305"></A><BR>We twain accomplished.  I it was who brought
<A NAME="306"></A><BR>To Atreus' sons Peleides far-renowned,
<A NAME="307"></A><BR>Their battle-helper.  Whensoe'er the host
<A NAME="308"></A><BR>Needeth some other champion, not for the sake
<A NAME="309"></A><BR>Of thine hands will he come, nor by the rede
<A NAME="310"></A><BR>Of other Argives: of Achaeans I
<A NAME="311"></A><BR>Alone will draw him with soft suasive words
<A NAME="312"></A><BR>To where strong men are warring.  Mighty power
<A NAME="313"></A><BR>The tongue hath over men, when courtesy
<A NAME="314"></A><BR>Inspires it.  Valour is a deedless thing;
<A NAME="315"></A><BR>And bulk and big assemblage of a man
<A NAME="316"></A><BR>Cometh to naught, by wisdom unattended.
<A NAME="317"></A><BR>But unto me the Immortals gave both strength
<A NAME="318"></A><BR>And wisdom, and unto the Argive host
<A NAME="319"></A><BR>Made me a blessing.  Nor, as thou hast said,
<A NAME="320"></A><BR>Hast thou in time past saved me when in flight
<A NAME="321"></A><BR>From foes.  I never fled, but steadfastly
<A NAME="322"></A><BR>Withstood the charge of all the Trojan host.
<A NAME="323"></A><BR>Furious the enemy came on like a flood
<A NAME="324"></A><BR>But I by might of hands cut short the thread
<A NAME="325"></A><BR>Of many lives.  Herein thou sayest not true
<A NAME="326"></A><BR>Me in the fray thou didst not shield nor save,
<A NAME="327"></A><BR>But for thine own life roughtest, lest a spear
<A NAME="328"></A><BR>Should pierce thy back if thou shouldst turn to 
<A NAME="329"></A>flee
<A NAME="330"></A><BR>From war.  My ships?  I drew them up mid-line,
<A NAME="331"></A><BR>Not dreading the battle-fury of any foe,
<A NAME="332"></A><BR>But to bring healing unto Atreus' sons
<A NAME="333"></A><BR>Of war's calamities: and thou didst set
<A NAME="334"></A><BR>Far from their help thy ships.  Nay more, I seamed
<A NAME="335"></A><BR>With cruel stripes my body, and entered so
<A NAME="336"></A><BR>The Trojans' burg, that I might learn of them
<A NAME="337"></A><BR>All their devisings for this troublous war.
<A NAME="338"></A><BR>Nor ever I dreaded Hector's spear; myself
<A NAME="339"></A><BR>Rose mid the foremost, eager for the fight,
<A NAME="340"></A><BR>When, prowess-confident, he defied us all.
<A NAME="341"></A><BR>Yea, in the fight around Achilles, I
<A NAME="342"></A><BR>Slew foes far more than thou; 'twas I who saved
<A NAME="343"></A><BR>The dead king with this armour.  Not a whit
<A NAME="344"></A><BR>I dread thy spear now, but my grievous hurt
<A NAME="345"></A><BR>With pain still vexeth me, the wound I gat
<A NAME="346"></A><BR>In fighting for these arms and their slain lord.
<A NAME="347"></A><BR>In me as in Achilles is Zeus' blood."
<A NAME="348"></A><BR><BR>He spake; strong Aias answered him again.
<A NAME="349"></A><BR>"Most cunning and most pestilent of men,
<A NAME="350"></A><BR>Nor I, nor any other Argive, saw
<A NAME="351"></A><BR>Thee toiling in that fray, when Trojans strove
<A NAME="352"></A><BR>Fiercely to hale away Achilles slain.
<A NAME="353"></A><BR>My might it was that with the spear unstrung
<A NAME="354"></A><BR>The knees of some in fight, and others thrilled
<A NAME="355"></A><BR>With panic as they pressed on ceaselessly.
<A NAME="356"></A><BR>Then fled they in dire straits, as geese or cranes
<A NAME="357"></A><BR>Flee from an eagle swooping as they feed
<A NAME="358"></A><BR>Along a grassy meadow; so, in dread
<A NAME="359"></A><BR>The Trojans shrinking backward from my spear
<A NAME="360"></A><BR>And lightening sword, fled into Ilium
<A NAME="361"></A><BR>To 'scape destruction.  If thy might came there
<A NAME="362"></A><BR>Ever at all, not anywhere nigh me
<A NAME="363"></A><BR>With foes thou foughtest: somewhere far aloot
<A NAME="364"></A><BR>Mid other ranks thou toiledst, nowhere nigh
<A NAME="365"></A><BR>Achilles, where the one great battle raged."
<A NAME="366"></A><BR><BR>He spake; replied Odysseus the shrewd heart:
<A NAME="367"></A><BR>"Aias, I hold myself no worse than thou
<A NAME="368"></A><BR>In wit or might, how goodly in outward show
<A NAME="369"></A><BR>Thou be soever.  Nay, I am keener far
<A NAME="370"></A><BR>Of wit than thou in all the Argives' eyes.
<A NAME="371"></A><BR>In battle-prowess do I equal thee
<A NAME="372"></A><BR>Haply surpass; and this the Trojans know,
<A NAME="373"></A><BR>Who tremble when they see me from afar.
<A NAME="374"></A><BR>Aye, thou too know'st, and others know my strength
<A NAME="375"></A><BR>By that hard struggle in the wrestling-match,
<A NAME="376"></A><BR>When Peleus' son set glorious prizes forth
<A NAME="377"></A><BR>Beside the barrow of Patroclus slain."
<A NAME="378"></A><BR><BR>So spake Laertes' son the world-renowned.
<A NAME="379"></A><BR>Then on that strife disastrous of the strong
<A NAME="380"></A><BR>The sons of Troy gave judgment.  Victory
<A NAME="381"></A><BR>And those immortal arms awarded they
<A NAME="382"></A><BR>With one consent to Odysseus mighty in war.
<A NAME="383"></A><BR>Greatly his soul rejoiced; but one deep groan
<A NAME="384"></A><BR>Brake from the Greeks.  Then Aias' noble might
<A NAME="385"></A><BR>Stood frozen stiff; and suddenly fell on him
<A NAME="386"></A><BR>Dark wilderment; all blood within his frame
<A NAME="387"></A><BR>Boiled, and his gall swelled, bursting forth in 
<A NAME="388"></A>flood.
<A NAME="389"></A><BR>Against his liver heaved his bowels; his heart
<A NAME="390"></A><BR>With anguished pangs was thrilled; fierce stabbing 
<A NAME="391"></A>throes
<A NAME="392"></A><BR>Shot through the filmy veil 'twixt bone and brain;
<A NAME="393"></A><BR>And darkness and confusion wrapped his mind.
<A NAME="394"></A><BR>With fixed eyes staring on the ground he stood
<A NAME="395"></A><BR>Still as a statue.  Then his sorrowing friends
<A NAME="396"></A><BR>Closed round him, led him to the shapely ships,
<A NAME="397"></A><BR>Aye murmuring consolations.  But his feet
<A NAME="398"></A><BR>Trod for the last time, with reluctant steps,
<A NAME="399"></A><BR>That path; and hard behind him followed Doom.
<A NAME="400"></A><BR><BR>When to the ships beside the boundless sea
<A NAME="401"></A><BR>The Argives, faint for supper and for sleep,
<A NAME="402"></A><BR>Had passed, into the great deep Thetis plunged,
<A NAME="403"></A><BR>And all the Nereids with her.  Round them swam
<A NAME="404"></A><BR>Sea-monsters many, children of the brine.
<A NAME="405"></A><BR><BR>Against the wise Prometheus bitter-wroth
<A NAME="406"></A><BR>The Sea-maids were, remembering how that Zeus,
<A NAME="407"></A><BR>Moved by his prophecies, unto Peleus gave
<A NAME="408"></A><BR>Thetis to wife, a most unwilling bride.
<A NAME="409"></A><BR>Then cried in wrath to these Cymothoe:
<A NAME="410"></A><BR>"O that the pestilent prophet had endured
<A NAME="411"></A><BR>All pangs he merited, when, deep-burrowing,
<A NAME="412"></A><BR>The eagle tare his liver aye renewed!"
<A NAME="413"></A><BR><BR>So to the dark-haired Sea-maids cried the Nymph.
<A NAME="414"></A><BR>Then sank the sun: the onrush of the night
<A NAME="415"></A><BR>Shadowed the fields, the heavens were star-bestrewn;
<A NAME="416"></A><BR>And by the long-prowed ships the Argives slept
<A NAME="417"></A><BR>By ambrosial sleep o'ermastered, and by wine
<A NAME="418"></A><BR>The which from proud Idomeneus' realm of Crete:
<A NAME="419"></A><BR>The shipmen bare o'er foaming leagues of sea.
<A NAME="420"></A><BR><BR>But Aias, wroth against the Argive men,
<A NAME="421"></A><BR>Would none of meat or drink, nor clasped him round
<A NAME="422"></A><BR>The arms of sleep. In fury he donned his mail,
<A NAME="423"></A><BR>He clutched his sword, thinking unspeakable thoughts;
<A NAME="424"></A><BR>For now he thought to set the ships aflame,
<A NAME="425"></A><BR>And slaughter all the Argives, now, to hew
<A NAME="426"></A><BR>With sudden onslaught of his terrible sword
<A NAME="427"></A><BR>Guileful Odysseus limb from limb.  Such things
<A NAME="428"></A><BR>He purposed -- nay, had soon accomplished all,
<A NAME="429"></A><BR>Had Pallas not with madness smitten him;
<A NAME="430"></A><BR>For over Odysseus, strong to endure, her heart
<A NAME="431"></A><BR>Yearned, as she called to mind the sacrifices
<A NAME="432"></A><BR>Offered to her of him continually.
<A NAME="433"></A><BR>Therefore she turned aside from Argive men
<A NAME="434"></A><BR>The might of Aias.  As a terrible storm,
<A NAME="435"></A><BR>Whose wings are laden with dread hurricane-blasts,
<A NAME="436"></A><BR>Cometh with portents of heart-numbing fear
<A NAME="437"></A><BR>To shipmen, when the Pleiads, fleeing adread
<A NAME="438"></A><BR>From glorious Orion, plunge beneath
<A NAME="439"></A><BR>The stream of tireless Ocean, when the air
<A NAME="440"></A><BR>Is turmoil, and the sea is mad with storm;
<A NAME="441"></A><BR>So rushed he, whithersoe'er his feet might bear.
<A NAME="442"></A><BR>This way and that he ran, like some fierce beast
<A NAME="443"></A><BR>Which darteth down a rock-walled glen's ravines
<A NAME="444"></A><BR>With foaming jaws, and murderous intent
<A NAME="445"></A><BR>Against the hounds and huntsmen, who have torn
<A NAME="446"></A><BR>Out of the cave her cubs, and slain: she runs
<A NAME="447"></A><BR>This way and that, and roars, if mid the brakes
<A NAME="448"></A><BR>Haply she yet may see the dear ones lost;
<A NAME="449"></A><BR>Whom if a man meet in that maddened mood,
<A NAME="450"></A><BR>Straightway his darkest of all days hath dawned;
<A NAME="451"></A><BR>So ruthless-raving rushed he; blackly boiled
<A NAME="452"></A><BR>His heart, as caldron on the Fire-god's hearth
<A NAME="453"></A><BR>Maddens with ceaseless hissing o'er the flames
<A NAME="454"></A><BR>From blazing billets coiling round its sides,
<A NAME="455"></A><BR>At bidding of the toiler eager-souled
<A NAME="456"></A><BR>To singe the bristles of a huge-fed boar;
<A NAME="457"></A><BR>So was his great heart boiling in his breast.
<A NAME="458"></A><BR>Like a wild sea he raved, like tempest-blast,
<A NAME="459"></A><BR>Like the winged might of tireless flame amidst
<A NAME="460"></A><BR>The mountains maddened by a mighty wind,
<A NAME="461"></A><BR>When the wide-blazing forest crumbles down
<A NAME="462"></A><BR>In fervent heat.  So Aias, his fierce heart
<A NAME="463"></A><BR>With agony stabbed, in maddened misery raved.
<A NAME="464"></A><BR>Foam frothed about his lips; a beast-like roar
<A NAME="465"></A><BR>Howled from his throat.  About his shoulders clashed
<A NAME="466"></A><BR>His armour.  They which saw him trembled, all
<A NAME="467"></A><BR>Cowed by the fearful shout of that one man.
<A NAME="468"></A><BR><BR>From Ocean then uprose Dawn golden-reined:
<A NAME="469"></A><BR>Like a soft wind upfloated Sleep to heaven,
<A NAME="470"></A><BR>And there met Hera, even then returned
<A NAME="471"></A><BR>To Olympus back from Tethys, unto whom
<A NAME="472"></A><BR>But yester-morn she went.  She clasped him round,
<A NAME="473"></A><BR>And kissed him, who had been her marriage-kin
<A NAME="474"></A><BR>Since at her prayer on Ida's erest he had lulled
<A NAME="475"></A><BR>To sleep Cronion, when his anger burned
<A NAME="476"></A><BR>Against the Argives.  Straightway Hera passed
<A NAME="477"></A><BR>To Zeus's mansion, and Sleep swiftly flew
<A NAME="478"></A><BR>To Pasithea's couch.  From slumber woke
<A NAME="479"></A><BR>All nations of the earth.  But Aias, like
<A NAME="480"></A><BR>Orion the invincible, prowled on,
<A NAME="481"></A><BR>Still bearing murderous madness in his heart.
<A NAME="482"></A><BR>He rushed upon the sheep, like lion fierce
<A NAME="483"></A><BR>Whose savage heart is stung with hunger-pangs.
<A NAME="484"></A><BR>Here, there, he smote them, laid them dead in dust
<A NAME="485"></A><BR>Thick as the leaves which the strong North-wind's 
<A NAME="486"></A>might
<A NAME="487"></A><BR>Strews, when the waning year to winter turns;
<A NAME="488"></A><BR>So on the sheep in fury Aias fell,
<A NAME="489"></A><BR>Deeming he dealt to Danaans evil doom.
<A NAME="490"></A><BR><BR>Then to his brother Menelaus came,
<A NAME="491"></A><BR>And spake, but not in hearing of the rest:
<A NAME="492"></A><BR>"This day shall surely be a ruinous day
<A NAME="493"></A><BR>For all, since Aias thus is sense-distraught.
<A NAME="494"></A><BR>It may be he will set the ships aflame,
<A NAME="495"></A><BR>And slay us all amidst our tents, in wrath
<A NAME="496"></A><BR>For those lost arms.  Would God that Thetis ne'er
<A NAME="497"></A><BR>Had set them for the prize of rivalry!
<A NAME="498"></A><BR>Would God Laertes' son had not presumed
<A NAME="499"></A><BR>In folly of soul to strive with a better man!
<A NAME="500"></A><BR>Fools were we all; and some malignant God
<A NAME="501"></A><BR>Beguiled us; for the one great war-defence
<A NAME="502"></A><BR>Left us, since Aeacus' son in battle fell,
<A NAME="503"></A><BR>Was Aias' mighty strength.  And now the Gods
<A NAME="504"></A><BR>Will to our loss destroy him, bringing bane
<A NAME="505"></A><BR>On thee and me, that all we may fill up
<A NAME="506"></A><BR>The cup of doom, and pass to nothingness."
<A NAME="507"></A><BR><BR>He spake; replied Agamemnon, lord of spears:
<A NAME="508"></A><BR>"Now nay, Menelaus, though thine heart he wrung,
<A NAME="509"></A><BR>Be thou not wroth with the resourceful king
<A NAME="510"></A><BR>Of Cephallenian folk, but with the Gods
<A NAME="511"></A><BR>Who plot our ruin.  Blame not him, who oft
<A NAME="512"></A><BR>Hath been our blessing and our enemies' curse."
<A NAME="513"></A><BR><BR>So heavy-hearted spake the Danaan kings.
<A NAME="514"></A><BR>But by the streams of Xanthus far away
<A NAME="515"></A><BR>'Neath tamarisks shepherds cowered to hide from 
<A NAME="516"></A>death,
<A NAME="517"></A><BR>As when from a swift eagle cower hares
<A NAME="518"></A><BR>'Neath tangled copses, when with sharp fierce scream
<A NAME="519"></A><BR>This way and that with wings wide-shadowing
<A NAME="520"></A><BR>He wheeleth very nigh; so they here, there,
<A NAME="521"></A><BR>Quailed from the presence of that furious man.
<A NAME="522"></A><BR>At last above a slaughtered ram he stood,
<A NAME="523"></A><BR>And with a deadly laugh he cried to it:
<A NAME="524"></A><BR>"Lie there in dust; be meat for dogs and kites!
<A NAME="525"></A><BR>Achilles' glorious arms have saved not thee,
<A NAME="526"></A><BR>For which thy folly strove with a better man!
<A NAME="527"></A><BR>Lie there, thou cur!  No wife shall fall on thee,
<A NAME="528"></A><BR>And clasp, and wail thee and her fatherless childs,
<A NAME="529"></A><BR>Nor shalt thou greet thy parents' longing eyes,
<A NAME="530"></A><BR>The staff of their old age!  Far from thy land
<A NAME="531"></A><BR>Thy carrion dogs and vultures shall devour!"
<A NAME="532"></A><BR><BR>So cried he, thinking that amidst the slain
<A NAME="533"></A><BR>Odysseus lay blood-boltered at his feet.
<A NAME="534"></A><BR>But in that moment from his mind and eyes
<A NAME="535"></A><BR>Athena tore away the nightmare-fiend
<A NAME="536"></A><BR>Of Madness havoc-breathing, and it passed
<A NAME="537"></A><BR>Thence swiftly to the rock-walled river Styx
<A NAME="538"></A><BR>Where dwell the winged Erinnyes, they which still
<A NAME="539"></A><BR>Visit with torments overweening men.
<A NAME="540"></A><BR><BR>Then Aias saw those sheep upon the earth
<A NAME="541"></A><BR>Gasping in death; and sore amazed he stood,
<A NAME="542"></A><BR>For he divined that by the Blessed Ones
<A NAME="543"></A><BR>His senses had been cheated.  All his limbs
<A NAME="544"></A><BR>Failed under him; his soul was anguished-thrilled:
<A NAME="545"></A><BR>He could not in his horror take one step
<A NAME="546"></A><BR>Forward nor backward.  Like some towering rock
<A NAME="547"></A><BR>Fast-rooted mid the mountains, there he stood.
<A NAME="548"></A><BR>But when the wild rout of his thoughts had rallied,
<A NAME="549"></A><BR>He groaned in misery, and in anguish wailed:
<A NAME="550"></A><BR>"Ah me! why do the Gods abhor me so?
<A NAME="551"></A><BR>They have wrecked my mind, have with fell madness 
<A NAME="552"></A>filled,
<A NAME="553"></A><BR>Making me slaughter all these innocent sheep!
<A NAME="554"></A><BR>Would God that on Odysseus' pestilent heart
<A NAME="555"></A><BR>Mine hands had so avenged me!  Miscreant, he
<A NAME="556"></A><BR>Brought on me a fell curse!  O may his soul
<A NAME="557"></A><BR>Suffer all torments that the Avenging Fiends
<A NAME="558"></A><BR>Devise for villains!  On all other Greeks
<A NAME="559"></A><BR>May they bring murderous battle, woeful griefs,
<A NAME="560"></A><BR>And chiefly on Agamemnon, Atreus' son!
<A NAME="561"></A><BR>Not scatheless to the home may he return
<A NAME="562"></A><BR>So long desired!  But why should I consort,
<A NAME="563"></A><BR>I, a brave man, with the abominable?
<A NAME="564"></A><BR>Perish the Argive host, perish my life,
<A NAME="565"></A><BR>Now unendurable!  The brave no more
<A NAME="566"></A><BR>Hath his due guerdon, but the baser sort
<A NAME="567"></A><BR>Are honoured most and loved, as this Odysseus
<A NAME="568"></A><BR>Hath worship mid the Greeks: but utterly
<A NAME="569"></A><BR>Have they forgotten me and all my deeds,
<A NAME="570"></A><BR>All that I wrought and suffered in their cause."
<A NAME="571"></A><BR><BR>So spake the brave son of strong Telamon,
<A NAME="572"></A><BR>Then thrust the sword of Hector through his throat.
<A NAME="573"></A><BR>Forth rushed the blood in torrent: in the dust
<A NAME="574"></A><BR>Outstretched he lay, like Typhon, when the bolts
<A NAME="575"></A><BR>Of Zeus had blasted him.  Around him groaned
<A NAME="576"></A><BR>The dark earth as he fell upon her breast.
<A NAME="577"></A><BR><BR>Then thronging came the Danaans, when they saw
<A NAME="578"></A><BR>Low laid in dust the hero; but ere then
<A NAME="579"></A><BR>None dared draw nigh him, but in deadly fear
<A NAME="580"></A><BR>They watched him from afar.  Now hasted they
<A NAME="581"></A><BR>And flung themselves upon the dead, outstretched
<A NAME="582"></A><BR>Upon their faces: on their heads they cast
<A NAME="583"></A><BR>Dust, and their wailing went up to the sky.
<A NAME="584"></A><BR>As when men drive away the tender lambs
<A NAME="585"></A><BR>Out of the fleecy flock, to feast thereon,
<A NAME="586"></A><BR>And round the desolate pens the mothers leap
<A NAME="587"></A><BR>Ceaselessly bleating, so o'er Aias rang
<A NAME="588"></A><BR>That day a very great and bitter cry.
<A NAME="589"></A><BR>Wild echoes pealed from Ida forest-palled,
<A NAME="590"></A><BR>And from the plain, the ships, the boundless sea.
<A NAME="591"></A><BR><BR>Then Teucer clasping him was minded too
<A NAME="592"></A><BR>To rush on bitter doom: howbeit the rest
<A NAME="593"></A><BR>Held from the sword his hand.  Anguished he fell
<A NAME="594"></A><BR>Upon the dead, outpouring many a tear
<A NAME="595"></A><BR>More comfortlessly than the orphan babe
<A NAME="596"></A><BR>That wails beside the hearth, with ashes strewn
<A NAME="597"></A><BR>On head and shoulders, wails bereavement's day
<A NAME="598"></A><BR>That brings death to the mother who hath nursed
<A NAME="599"></A><BR>The fatherless child; so wailed he, ever wailed
<A NAME="600"></A><BR>His great death-stricken brother, creeping slow
<A NAME="601"></A><BR>Around the corpse, and uttering his lament:
<A NAME="602"></A><BR>"O Aias, mighty-souled, why was thine heart
<A NAME="603"></A><BR>Distraught, that thou shouldst deal unto thyself
<A NAME="604"></A><BR>Murder and bale?  All, was it that the sons
<A NAME="605"></A><BR>Of Troy might win a breathing-space from woes,
<A NAME="606"></A><BR>Might come and slay the Greeks, now thou art not?
<A NAME="607"></A><BR>From these shall all the olden courage fail
<A NAME="608"></A><BR>When fast they fall in fight.  Their shield from 
<A NAME="609"></A>harm
<A NAME="610"></A><BR>s broken now!  For me, I have no will
<A NAME="611"></A><BR>To see mine home again, now thou art dead.
<A NAME="612"></A><BR>Nay, but I long here also now to die,
<A NAME="613"></A><BR>That so the earth may shroud me -- me and thee
<A NAME="614"></A><BR>Not for my parents so much do I care,
<A NAME="615"></A><BR>If haply yet they live, if haply yet
<A NAME="616"></A><BR>Spared from the grave, in Salamis they dwell,
<A NAME="617"></A><BR>As for thee, O my glory and my crown!"
<A NAME="618"></A><BR><BR>So cried he groaning sore; with answering moan
<A NAME="619"></A><BR>Queenly Tecmessa wailed, the princess-bride
<A NAME="620"></A><BR>Of noble Aias, captive of his spear,
<A NAME="621"></A><BR>Yet ta'en by him to wife, and household-queen
<A NAME="622"></A><BR>O'er all his substance, even all that wives
<A NAME="623"></A><BR>Won with a bride-price rule for wedded lords.
<A NAME="624"></A><BR>Clasped in his mighty arms, she bare to him
<A NAME="625"></A><BR>A son Eurysaces, in all things like
<A NAME="626"></A><BR>Unto his father, far as babe might be
<A NAME="627"></A><BR>Yet cradled in his tent.  With bitter moan
<A NAME="628"></A><BR>Fell she on that dear corpse, all her fair form
<A NAME="629"></A><BR>Close-shrouded in her veil, and dust-defiled,
<A NAME="630"></A><BR>And from her anguished heart cried piteously:
<A NAME="631"></A><BR>"Alas for me, for me now thou art dead,
<A NAME="632"></A><BR>Not by the hands of foes in fight struck down,
<A NAME="633"></A><BR>But by thine own!  On me is come a grief
<A NAME="634"></A><BR>Ever-abiding!  Never had I looked
<A NAME="635"></A><BR>To see thy woeful death-day here by Troy.
<A NAME="636"></A><BR>Ah, visions shattered by rude hands of Fate!
<A NAME="637"></A><BR>Oh that the earth had yawned wide for my grave
<A NAME="638"></A><BR>Ere I beheld thy bitter doom!  On me
<A NAME="639"></A><BR>No sharper, more heart-piercing pang hath come --
<A NAME="640"></A><BR>No, not when first from fatherland afar
<A NAME="641"></A><BR>And parents thou didst bear me, wailing sore
<A NAME="642"></A><BR>Mid other captives, when the day of bondage
<A NAME="643"></A><BR>Had come on me, a princess theretofore.
<A NAME="644"></A><BR>Not for that dear lost home so much I grieve,
<A NAME="645"></A><BR>Nor for my parents dead, as now for thee:
<A NAME="646"></A><BR>For all thine heart was kindness unto me
<A NAME="647"></A><BR>The hapless, and thou madest me thy wife,
<A NAME="648"></A><BR>One soul with thee; yea, and thou promisedst
<A NAME="649"></A><BR>To throne me queen of fair-towered Salamis,
<A NAME="650"></A><BR>When home we won from Troy.  The Gods denied
<A NAME="651"></A><BR>Accomplishment thereof.  And thou hast passed
<A NAME="652"></A><BR>Unto the Unseen Land: thou hast forgot
<A NAME="653"></A><BR>Me and thy child, who never shall make glad
<A NAME="654"></A><BR>His father's heart, shall never mount thy throne.
<A NAME="655"></A><BR>But him shall strangers make a wretched thrall:
<A NAME="656"></A><BR>For when the father is no more, the babe
<A NAME="657"></A><BR>Is ward of meaner men.  A weary life
<A NAME="658"></A><BR>The orphan knows, and suffering cometh in
<A NAME="659"></A><BR>From every side upon him like a flood.
<A NAME="660"></A><BR>To me too thraldom's day shall doubtless come,
<A NAME="661"></A><BR>Now thou hast died, who wast my god on earth."
<A NAME="662"></A><BR><BR>Then in all kindness Agamemnon spake:
<A NAME="663"></A><BR>"Princess, no man on earth shall make thee thrall,
<A NAME="664"></A><BR>While Teucer liveth yet, while yet I live.
<A NAME="665"></A><BR>Thou shalt have worship of us evermore
<A NAME="666"></A><BR>And honour as a Goddess, with thy son,
<A NAME="667"></A><BR>As though yet living were that godlike man,
<A NAME="668"></A><BR>Aias, who was the Achaeans' chiefest strength.
<A NAME="669"></A><BR>Ah that he had not laid this load of grief
<A NAME="670"></A><BR>On all, in dying by his own right hand!
<A NAME="671"></A><BR>For all the countless armies of his foes
<A NAME="672"></A><BR>Never availed to slay him in fair fight."
<A NAME="673"></A><BR><BR>So spake he, grieved to the inmost heart.  The 
<A NAME="674"></A>folk
<A NAME="675"></A><BR>Woefully wafted all round.  O'er Hellespont
<A NAME="676"></A><BR>Echoes of mourning rolled: the sighing air
<A NAME="677"></A><BR>Darkened around, a wide-spread sorrow-pall.
<A NAME="678"></A><BR>Yea, grief laid hold on wise Odysseus' self
<A NAME="679"></A><BR>For the great dead, and with remorseful soul
<A NAME="680"></A><BR>To anguish-stricken Argives thus he spake:
<A NAME="681"></A><BR>"O friends, there is no greater curse to men
<A NAME="682"></A><BR>Than wrath, which groweth till its bitter fruit
<A NAME="683"></A><BR>Is strife.  Now wrath hath goaded Aias on
<A NAME="684"></A><BR>To this dire issue of the rage that filled
<A NAME="685"></A><BR>His soul against me.  Would to God that ne'er
<A NAME="686"></A><BR>Yon Trojans in the strife for Achilles' arms
<A NAME="687"></A><BR>Had crowned me with that victory, for which
<A NAME="688"></A><BR>Strong Telamon's brave son, in agony
<A NAME="689"></A><BR>Of soul, thus perished by his own right hand!
<A NAME="690"></A><BR>Yet blame not me, I pray you, for his wrath:
<A NAME="691"></A><BR>Blame the dark dolorous Fate that struck him down.
<A NAME="692"></A><BR>For, had mine heart foreboded aught of this,
<A NAME="693"></A><BR>This desperation of a soul distraught,
<A NAME="694"></A><BR>Never for victory had I striven with him,
<A NAME="695"></A><BR>Nor had I suffered any Danaan else,
<A NAME="696"></A><BR>Though ne'er so eager, to contend with him.
<A NAME="697"></A><BR>Nay, I had taken up those arms divine
<A NAME="698"></A><BR>With mine own hands, and gladly given them
<A NAME="699"></A><BR>To him, ay, though himself desired it not.
<A NAME="700"></A><BR>But for such mighty grief and wrath in him
<A NAME="701"></A><BR>I had not looked, since not for a woman's sake
<A NAME="702"></A><BR>Nor for a city, nor possessions wide,
<A NAME="703"></A><BR>I then contended, but for Honour's meed,
<A NAME="704"></A><BR>Which alway is for all right-hearted men
<A NAME="705"></A><BR>The happy goal of all their rivalry.
<A NAME="706"></A><BR>But that great-hearted man was led astray
<A NAME="707"></A><BR>By Fate, the hateful fiend; for surely it is
<A NAME="708"></A><BR>Unworthy a man to be made passion's fool.
<A NAME="709"></A><BR>The wise man's part is, steadfast-souled to endure
<A NAME="710"></A><BR>All ills, and not to rage against his lot."
<A NAME="711"></A><BR><BR>So spake Laertes' son, the far-renowned.
<A NAME="712"></A><BR>But when they all were weary of grief and groan,
<A NAME="713"></A><BR>Then to those sorrowing ones spake Neleus' son:
<A NAME="714"></A><BR>"O friends, the pitiless-hearted Fates have laid
<A NAME="715"></A><BR>Stroke after stroke of sorrow upon us,
<A NAME="716"></A><BR>Sorrow for Aias dead, for mighty Achilles,
<A NAME="717"></A><BR>For many an Argive, and for mine own son
<A NAME="718"></A><BR>Antilochus.  Yet all unmeet it is
<A NAME="719"></A><BR>Day after day with passion of grief to wail
<A NAME="720"></A><BR>Men slain in battle: nay, we must forget
<A NAME="721"></A><BR>Laments, and turn us to the better task
<A NAME="722"></A><BR>Of rendering dues beseeming to the dead,
<A NAME="723"></A><BR>The dues of pyre, of tomb, of bones inurned.
<A NAME="724"></A><BR>No lamentations will awake the dead;
<A NAME="725"></A><BR>No note thereof he taketh, when the Fates,
<A NAME="726"></A><BR>The ruthless ones, have swallowed him in night."
<A NAME="727"></A><BR><BR>So spake he words of cheer: the godlike kings
<A NAME="728"></A><BR>Gathered with heavy hearts around the dead,
<A NAME="729"></A><BR>And many hands upheaved the giant corpse,
<A NAME="730"></A><BR>And swiftly bare him to the ships, and there
<A NAME="731"></A><BR>Washed they away the blood that clotted lay
<A NAME="732"></A><BR>Dust-flecked on mighty limbs and armour: then
<A NAME="733"></A><BR>In linen swathed him round.  From Ida's heights
<A NAME="734"></A><BR>Wood without measure did the young men bring,
<A NAME="735"></A><BR>And piled it round the corpse.  Billets and logs
<A NAME="736"></A><BR>Yet more in a wide circle heaped they round;
<A NAME="737"></A><BR>And sheep they laid thereon, fair-woven vests,
<A NAME="738"></A><BR>And goodly kine, and speed-triumphant steeds,
<A NAME="739"></A><BR>And gleaming gold, and armour without stint,
<A NAME="740"></A><BR>From slain foes by that glorious hero stripped.
<A NAME="741"></A><BR>And lucent amber-drops they laid thereon,
<A NAME="742"></A><BR>Years, say they, which the Daughters of the Sun,
<A NAME="743"></A><BR>The Lord of Omens, shed for Phaethon slain,
<A NAME="744"></A><BR>When by Eridanus' flood they mourned for him.
<A NAME="745"></A><BR>These, for undying honour to his son,
<A NAME="746"></A><BR>The God made amber, precious in men's eyes.
<A NAME="747"></A><BR>Even this the Argives on that broad-based pyre
<A NAME="748"></A><BR>Cast freely, honouring the mighty dead.
<A NAME="749"></A><BR>And round him, groaning heavily, they laid
<A NAME="750"></A><BR>Silver most fair and precious ivory,
<A NAME="751"></A><BR>And jars of oil, and whatsoe'er beside
<A NAME="752"></A><BR>They have who heap up goodly and glorious wealth.
<A NAME="753"></A><BR>Then thrust they in the strength of ravening flame,
<A NAME="754"></A><BR>And from the sea there breathed a wind, sent forth
<A NAME="755"></A><BR>By Thetis, to consume the giant frame
<A NAME="756"></A><BR>Of Aias.  All the night and all the morn
<A NAME="757"></A><BR>Burned 'neath the urgent stress of that great wind
<A NAME="758"></A><BR>Beside the ships that giant form, as when
<A NAME="759"></A><BR>Enceladus by Zeus' levin was consumed
<A NAME="760"></A><BR>Beneath Thrinacia, when from all the isle
<A NAME="761"></A><BR>Smoke of his burning rose -- or like as when
<A NAME="762"></A><BR>Hercules, trapped by Nessus' deadly guile,
<A NAME="763"></A><BR>Gave to devouring fire his living limbs,
<A NAME="764"></A><BR>What time he dared that awful deed, when groaned
<A NAME="765"></A><BR>All Oeta as he burned alive, and passed
<A NAME="766"></A><BR>His soul into the air, leaving the man
<A NAME="767"></A><BR>Far-famous, to be numbered with the Gods,
<A NAME="768"></A><BR>When earth closed o'er his toil-tried mortal part.
<A NAME="769"></A><BR>So huge amid the flames, all-armour clad,
<A NAME="770"></A><BR>Lay Aias, all the joy of fight forgot,
<A NAME="771"></A><BR>While a great multitude watching thronged the sands.
<A NAME="772"></A><BR>Glad were the Trojans, but the Achaeans grieved.
<A NAME="773"></A><BR><BR>But when that goodly frame by ravening fire
<A NAME="774"></A><BR>Was all consumed, they quenched the pyre with wine;
<A NAME="775"></A><BR>They gathered up the bones, and reverently
<A NAME="776"></A><BR>Laid in a golden casket.  Hard beside
<A NAME="777"></A><BR>Rhoeteium's headland heaped they up a mound
<A NAME="778"></A><BR>Measureless-high.  Then scattered they amidst
<A NAME="779"></A><BR>The long ships, heavy-hearted for the man
<A NAME="780"></A><BR>Whom they had honoured even as Achilles.
<A NAME="781"></A><BR>Then black night, bearing unto all men sleep,
<A NAME="782"></A><BR>Upfloated: so they brake bread, and lay down
<A NAME="783"></A><BR>Waiting the Child of the Mist.  Short was sleep,
<A NAME="784"></A><BR>Broken by fitful staring through the dark,
<A NAME="785"></A><BR>Haunted by dread lest in the night the foe
<A NAME="786"></A><BR>Should fall on them, now Telamon's son was dead.
