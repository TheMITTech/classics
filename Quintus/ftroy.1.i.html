<A NAME="10"></A><B>How Died for Troy the Queen of the Amazons, Penthesileia</B>
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="11"></A>When godlike Hector by Peleides slain
<A NAME="12"></A><BR>Passed, and the pyre had ravined up his flesh,
<A NAME="13"></A><BR>And earth had veiled his bones, the Trojans then
<A NAME="14"></A><BR>Tarried in Priam's city, sore afraid
<A NAME="15"></A><BR>Before the might of stout-heart Aeacus' son:
<A NAME="16"></A><BR>As kine they were, that midst the copses shrink
<A NAME="17"></A><BR>From faring forth to meet a lion grim,
<A NAME="18"></A><BR>But in dense thickets terror-huddled cower;
<A NAME="19"></A><BR>So in their fortress shivered these to see
<A NAME="20"></A><BR>That mighty man.  Of those already dead
<A NAME="21"></A><BR>They thought of all whose lives he reft away
<A NAME="22"></A><BR>As by Scamander's outfall on he rushed,
<A NAME="23"></A><BR>And all that in mid-flight to that high wall
<A NAME="24"></A><BR>He slew, how he quelled Hector, how he haled
<A NAME="25"></A><BR>His corse round Troy; -- yea, and of all beside
<A NAME="26"></A><BR>Laid low by him since that first day whereon
<A NAME="27"></A><BR>O'er restless seas he brought the Trojans doom.
<A NAME="28"></A><BR>Ay, all these they remembered, while they stayed
<A NAME="29"></A><BR>Thus in their town, and o'er them anguished grief
<A NAME="30"></A><BR>Hovered dark-winged, as though that very day
<A NAME="31"></A><BR>All Troy with shrieks were crumbling down in fire.
<A NAME="32"></A><BR><BR>Then from Thermodon, from broad-sweeping streams,
<A NAME="33"></A><BR>Came, clothed upon with beauty of Goddesses,
<A NAME="34"></A><BR>Penthesileia -- came athirst indeed
<A NAME="35"></A><BR>For groan-resounding battle, but yet more
<A NAME="36"></A><BR>Fleeing abhorred reproach and evil fame,
<A NAME="37"></A><BR>Lest they of her own folk should rail on her
<A NAME="38"></A><BR>Because of her own sister's death, for whom
<A NAME="39"></A><BR>Ever her sorrows waxed, Hippolyte,
<A NAME="40"></A><BR>Whom she had struck dead with her mighty spear,
<A NAME="41"></A><BR>Not of her will -- 'twas at a stag she hurled.
<A NAME="42"></A><BR>So came she to the far-famed land of Troy.
<A NAME="43"></A><BR>Yea, and her warrior spirit pricked her on,
<A NAME="44"></A><BR>Of murder's dread pollution thus to cleanse
<A NAME="45"></A><BR>Her soul, and with such sacrifice to appease
<A NAME="46"></A><BR>The Awful Ones, the Erinnyes, who in wrath
<A NAME="47"></A><BR>For her slain sister straightway haunted her
<A NAME="48"></A><BR>Unseen: for ever round the sinner's steps
<A NAME="49"></A><BR>They hover; none may 'scape those Goddesses.
<A NAME="50"></A><BR>And with her followed twelve beside, each one
<A NAME="51"></A><BR>A princess, hot for war and battle grim,
<A NAME="52"></A><BR>Far-famous each, yet handmaids unto her:
<A NAME="53"></A><BR>Penthesileia far outshone them all.
<A NAME="54"></A><BR>As when in the broad sky amidst the stars
<A NAME="55"></A><BR>The moon rides over all pre-eminent,
<A NAME="56"></A><BR>When through the thunderclouds the cleaving heavens
<A NAME="57"></A><BR>Open, when sleep the fury-breathing winds;
<A NAME="58"></A><BR>So peerless was she mid that charging host.
<A NAME="59"></A><BR>Clonie was there, Polemusa, Derinoe,
<A NAME="60"></A><BR>Evandre, and Antandre, and Bremusa,
<A NAME="61"></A><BR>Hippothoe, dark-eyed Harmothoe,
<A NAME="62"></A><BR>Alcibie, Derimacheia, Antibrote,
<A NAME="63"></A><BR>And Thermodosa glorying with the spear.
<A NAME="64"></A><BR>All these to battle fared with warrior-souled
<A NAME="65"></A><BR>Penthesileia: even as when descends
<A NAME="66"></A><BR>Dawn from Olympus' crest of adamant,
<A NAME="67"></A><BR>Dawn, heart-exultant in her radiant steeds
<A NAME="68"></A><BR>Amidst the bright-haired Hours; and o'er them all,
<A NAME="69"></A><BR>How flawless-fair soever these may be,
<A NAME="70"></A><BR>Her splendour of beauty glows pre-eminent;
<A NAME="71"></A><BR>So peerless amid all the Amazons Unto
<A NAME="72"></A><BR>Troy-town Penthesileia came.
<A NAME="73"></A><BR>To right, to left, from all sides hurrying thronged
<A NAME="74"></A><BR>The Trojans, greatly marvelling, when they saw
<A NAME="75"></A><BR>The tireless War-god's child, the mailed maid,
<A NAME="76"></A><BR>Like to the Blessed Gods; for in her face
<A NAME="77"></A><BR>Glowed beauty glorious and terrible.
<A NAME="78"></A><BR>Her smile was ravishing: beneath her brows
<A NAME="79"></A><BR>Her love-enkindling eyes shone like to stars,
<A NAME="80"></A><BR>And with the crimson rose of shamefastness
<A NAME="81"></A><BR>Bright were her cheeks, and mantled over them
<A NAME="82"></A><BR>Unearthly grace with battle-prowess clad.
<A NAME="83"></A><BR><BR>Then joyed Troy's folk, despite past agonies,
<A NAME="84"></A><BR>As when, far-gazing from a height, the hinds
<A NAME="85"></A><BR>Behold a rainbow spanning the wide sea,
<A NAME="86"></A><BR>When they be yearning for the heaven-sent shower,
<A NAME="87"></A><BR>When the parched fields be craving for the rain;
<A NAME="88"></A><BR>Then the great sky at last is overgloomed,
<A NAME="89"></A><BR>And men see that fair sign of coming wind
<A NAME="90"></A><BR>And imminent rain, and seeing, they are glad,
<A NAME="91"></A><BR>Who for their corn-fields' plight sore sighed before;
<A NAME="92"></A><BR>Even so the sons of Troy when they beheld
<A NAME="93"></A><BR>There in their land Penthesileia dread
<A NAME="94"></A><BR>Afire for battle, were exceeding glad;
<A NAME="95"></A><BR>For when the heart is thrilled with hope of good,
<A NAME="96"></A><BR>All smart of evils past is wiped away:
<A NAME="97"></A><BR>So, after all his sighing and his pain,
<A NAME="98"></A><BR>Gladdened a little while was Priam's soul.
<A NAME="99"></A><BR>As when a man who hath suffered many a pang
<A NAME="100"></A><BR>From blinded eyes, sore longing to behold
<A NAME="101"></A><BR>The light, and, if he may not, fain would die,
<A NAME="102"></A><BR>Then at the last, by a cunning leech's skill,
<A NAME="103"></A><BR>Or by a God's grace, sees the dawn-rose flush,
<A NAME="104"></A><BR>Sees the mist rolled back from before his eyes, 
<A NAME="105"></A>--
<A NAME="106"></A><BR>Yea, though clear vision come not as of old,
<A NAME="107"></A><BR>Yet, after all his anguish, joys to have
<A NAME="108"></A><BR>Some small relief, albeit the stings of pain
<A NAME="109"></A><BR>Prick sharply yet beneath his eyelids; -- so
<A NAME="110"></A><BR>Joyed the old king to see that terrible queen --
<A NAME="111"></A><BR>The shadowy joy of one in anguish whelmed
<A NAME="112"></A><BR>For slain sons.  Into his halls he led the Maid,
<A NAME="113"></A><BR>And with glad welcome honoured her, as one
<A NAME="114"></A><BR>Who greets a daughter to her home returned
<A NAME="115"></A><BR>From a far country in the twentieth year;
<A NAME="116"></A><BR>And set a feast before her, sumptuous
<A NAME="117"></A><BR>As battle-glorious kings, who have brought low
<A NAME="118"></A><BR>Nations of foes, array in splendour of pomp,
<A NAME="119"></A><BR>With hearts in pride of victory triumphing.
<A NAME="120"></A><BR>And gifts he gave her costly and fair to see,
<A NAME="121"></A><BR>And pledged him to give many more, so she
<A NAME="122"></A><BR>Would save the Trojans from the imminent doom.
<A NAME="123"></A><BR>And she such deeds she promised as no man
<A NAME="124"></A><BR>Had hoped for, even to lay Achilles low,
<A NAME="125"></A><BR>To smite the wide host of the Argive men,
<A NAME="126"></A><BR>And cast the brands red-flaming on the ships.
<A NAME="127"></A><BR>Ah fool! -- but little knew she him, the lord
<A NAME="128"></A><BR>Of ashen spears, how far Achilles' might
<A NAME="129"></A><BR>In warrior-wasting strife o'erpassed her own!
<A NAME="130"></A><BR><BR>But when Andromache, the stately child
<A NAME="131"></A><BR>Of king Eetion, heard the wild queen's vaunt,
<A NAME="132"></A><BR>Low to her own soul bitterly murmured she:
<A NAME="133"></A><BR>"Ah hapless!  why with arrogant heart dost thou
<A NAME="134"></A><BR>Speak such great swelling words?  No strength is 
<A NAME="135"></A>thine
<A NAME="136"></A><BR>To grapple in fight with Peleus' aweless son.
<A NAME="137"></A><BR>Nay, doom and swift death shall he deal to thee.
<A NAME="138"></A><BR>Alas for thee!  What madness thrills thy soul?
<A NAME="139"></A><BR>Fate and the end of death stand hard by thee!
<A NAME="140"></A><BR>Hector was mightier far to wield the spear
<A NAME="141"></A><BR>Than thou, yet was for all his prowess slain,
<A NAME="142"></A><BR>Slain for the bitter grief of Troy, whose folk
<A NAME="143"></A><BR>The city through looked on him as a God.
<A NAME="144"></A><BR>My glory and his noble parents' glory
<A NAME="145"></A><BR>Was he while yet he lived -- O that the earth
<A NAME="146"></A><BR>Over my dead face had been mounded high,
<A NAME="147"></A><BR>Or ever through his throat the breath of life
<A NAME="148"></A><BR>Followed the cleaving spear!  But now have I
<A NAME="149"></A><BR>Looked -- woe is me! -- on grief unutterable,
<A NAME="150"></A><BR>When round the city those fleet-footed steeds
<A NAME="151"></A><BR>Haled him, steeds of Achilles, who had made
<A NAME="152"></A><BR>Me widowed of mine hero-husband, made
<A NAME="153"></A><BR>My portion bitterness through all my days."
<A NAME="154"></A><BR><BR>So spake Eetion's lovely-ankled child
<A NAME="155"></A><BR>Low to her own soul, thinking on her lord.
<A NAME="156"></A><BR>So evermore the faithful-hearted wife
<A NAME="157"></A><BR>Nurseth for her lost love undying grief.
<A NAME="158"></A><BR><BR>Then in swift revolution sweeping round
<A NAME="159"></A><BR>Into the Ocean's deep stream sank the sun,
<A NAME="160"></A><BR>And daylight died.  So when the banqueters
<A NAME="161"></A><BR>Ceased from the wine-cup and the goodly feast,
<A NAME="162"></A><BR>Then did the handmaids spread in Priam's halls
<A NAME="163"></A><BR>For Penthesileia dauntless-souled the couch
<A NAME="164"></A><BR>Heart-cheering, and she laid her down to rest;
<A NAME="165"></A><BR>And slumber mist-like overveiled her eyes [depths
<A NAME="166"></A><BR>Like sweet dew dropping round.  From heavens' blue
<A NAME="167"></A><BR>Slid down the might of a deceitful dream
<A NAME="168"></A><BR>At Pallas' hest, that so the warrior-maid
<A NAME="169"></A><BR>Might see it, and become a curse to Troy
<A NAME="170"></A><BR>And to herself, when strained her soul to meet;
<A NAME="171"></A><BR>The whirlwind of the battle.  In this wise
<A NAME="172"></A><BR>The Trito-born, the subtle-souled, contrived:
<A NAME="173"></A><BR>Stood o'er the maiden's head that baleful dream
<A NAME="174"></A><BR>In likeness of her father, kindling her
<A NAME="175"></A><BR>Fearlessly front to front to meet in fight
<A NAME="176"></A><BR>Fleetfoot Achilles.  And she heard the voice,
<A NAME="177"></A><BR>And all her heart exulted, for she weened
<A NAME="178"></A><BR>That she should on that dawning day achieve
<A NAME="179"></A><BR>A mighty deed in battle's deadly toil
<A NAME="180"></A><BR>Ah, fool, who trusted for her sorrow a dream
<A NAME="181"></A><BR>Out of the sunless land, such as beguiles
<A NAME="182"></A><BR>Full oft the travail-burdened tribes of men,
<A NAME="183"></A><BR>Whispering mocking lies in sleeping ears,
<A NAME="184"></A><BR>And to the battle's travail lured her then!
<A NAME="185"></A><BR><BR>But when the Dawn, the rosy-ankled, leapt
<A NAME="186"></A><BR>Up from her bed, then, clad in mighty strength
<A NAME="187"></A><BR>Of spirit, suddenly from her couch uprose
<A NAME="188"></A><BR>Penthesileia.  Then did she array
<A NAME="189"></A><BR>Her shoulders in those wondrous-fashioned arms
<A NAME="190"></A><BR>Given her of the War-god.  First she laid
<A NAME="191"></A><BR>Beneath her silver-gleaming knees the greaves
<A NAME="192"></A><BR>Fashioned of gold, close-clipping the strong limbs.
<A NAME="193"></A><BR>Her rainbow-radiant corslet clasped she then
<A NAME="194"></A><BR>About her, and around her shoulders slung,
<A NAME="195"></A><BR>With glory in her heart, the massy brand
<A NAME="196"></A><BR>Whose shining length was in a scabbard sheathed
<A NAME="197"></A><BR>Of ivory and silver.  Next, her shield
<A NAME="198"></A><BR>Unearthly splendid, caught she up, whose rim
<A NAME="199"></A><BR>Swelled like the young moon's arching chariot-rail
<A NAME="200"></A><BR>When high o'er Ocean's fathomless-flowing stream
<A NAME="201"></A><BR>She rises, with the space half filled with light
<A NAME="202"></A><BR>Betwixt her bowing horns.  So did it shine
<A NAME="203"></A><BR>Unutterably fair.  Then on her head
<A NAME="204"></A><BR>She settled the bright helmet overstreamed
<A NAME="205"></A><BR>With a wild mane of golden-glistering hairs.
<A NAME="206"></A><BR>So stood she, lapped about with flaming mail,
<A NAME="207"></A><BR>In semblance like the lightning, which the might,
<A NAME="208"></A><BR>The never-wearied might of Zeus, to earth
<A NAME="209"></A><BR>Hurleth, what time he showeth forth to men
<A NAME="210"></A><BR>Fury of thunderous-roaring rain, or swoop
<A NAME="211"></A><BR>Resistless of his shouting host of winds.
<A NAME="212"></A><BR>Then in hot haste forth of her bower to pass
<A NAME="213"></A><BR>Caught she two javelins in the hand that grasped
<A NAME="214"></A><BR>Her shield-band; but her strong right hand laid 
<A NAME="215"></A>hold
<A NAME="216"></A><BR>On a huge halberd, sharp of either blade,
<A NAME="217"></A><BR>Which terrible Eris gave to Ares' child
<A NAME="218"></A><BR>To be her Titan weapon in the strife
<A NAME="219"></A><BR>That raveneth souls of men.  Laughing for glee
<A NAME="220"></A><BR>Thereover, swiftly flashed she forth the ring
<A NAME="221"></A><BR>Of towers.  Her coming kindled all the sons
<A NAME="222"></A><BR>Of Troy to rush into the battle forth
<A NAME="223"></A><BR>Which crowneth men with glory.  Swiftly all
<A NAME="224"></A><BR>Hearkened her gathering-ery, and thronging came,
<A NAME="225"></A><BR>Champions, yea, even such as theretofore
<A NAME="226"></A><BR>Shrank back from standing in the ranks of war
<A NAME="227"></A><BR>Against Achilles the all-ravager.
<A NAME="228"></A><BR>But she in pride of triumph on she rode
<A NAME="229"></A><BR>Throned on a goodly steed and fleet, the gift
<A NAME="230"></A><BR>Of Oreithyia, the wild North-wind's bride,
<A NAME="231"></A><BR>Given to her guest the warrior-maid, what time
<A NAME="232"></A><BR>She came to Thrace, a steed whose flying feet
<A NAME="233"></A><BR>Could match the Harpies' wings.  Riding thereon
<A NAME="234"></A><BR>Penthesileia in her goodlihead
<A NAME="235"></A><BR>Left the tall palaces of Troy behind.
<A NAME="236"></A><BR>And ever were the ghastly-visaged Fates
<A NAME="237"></A><BR>Thrusting her on into the battle, doomed
<A NAME="238"></A><BR>To be her first against the Greeks -- and last!
<A NAME="239"></A><BR>To right, to left, with unreturning feet
<A NAME="240"></A><BR>The Trojan thousands followed to the fray,
<A NAME="241"></A><BR>The pitiless fray, that death-doomed warrior-maid,
<A NAME="242"></A><BR>Followed in throngs, as follow sheep the ram
<A NAME="243"></A><BR>That by the shepherd's art strides before all.
<A NAME="244"></A><BR>So followed they, with battle-fury filled,
<A NAME="245"></A><BR>Strong Trojans and wild-hearted Amazons.
<A NAME="246"></A><BR>And like Tritonis seemed she, as she went
<A NAME="247"></A><BR>To meet the Giants, or as flasheth far
<A NAME="248"></A><BR>Through war-hosts Eris, waker of onset-shouts.
<A NAME="249"></A><BR>So mighty in the Trojans' midst she seemed,
<A NAME="250"></A><BR>Penthesileia of the flying feet.
<A NAME="251"></A><BR><BR>Then unto Cronos' Son Laomedon's child
<A NAME="252"></A><BR>Upraised his hands, his sorrow-burdened hands,
<A NAME="253"></A><BR>Turning him toward the sky-encountering fane
<A NAME="254"></A><BR>Of Zeus of Ida, who with sleepless eyes
<A NAME="255"></A><BR>Looks ever down on Ilium; and he prayed:
<A NAME="256"></A><BR>"Father, give ear!  Vouchsafe that on this day
<A NAME="257"></A><BR>Achaea's host may fall before the hands
<A NAME="258"></A><BR>Of this our warrior-queen, the War-god's child;
<A NAME="259"></A><BR>And do thou bring her back unscathed again
<A NAME="260"></A><BR>Unto mine halls: we pray thee by the love
<A NAME="261"></A><BR>Thou bear'st to Ares of the fiery heart
<A NAME="262"></A><BR>Thy son, yea, to her also!  is she not
<A NAME="263"></A><BR>Most wondrous like the heavenly Goddesses?
<A NAME="264"></A><BR>And is she not the child of thine own seed?
<A NAME="265"></A><BR>Pity my stricken heart withal!  Thou know'st
<A NAME="266"></A><BR>All agonies I have suffered in the deaths
<A NAME="267"></A><BR>Of dear sons whom the Fates have torn from me
<A NAME="268"></A><BR>By Argive hands in the devouring fight.
<A NAME="269"></A><BR>Compassionate us, while a remnant yet
<A NAME="270"></A><BR>Remains of noble Dardanus' blood, while yet
<A NAME="271"></A><BR>This city stands unwasted!  Let us know
<A NAME="272"></A><BR>From ghastly slaughter and strife one breathing-space!"
<A NAME="273"></A><BR><BR>In passionate prayer he spake: -- lo, with shrill 
<A NAME="274"></A>scream
<A NAME="275"></A><BR>Swiftly to left an eagle darted by
<A NAME="276"></A><BR>And in his talons bare a gasping dove.
<A NAME="277"></A><BR>Then round the heart of Priam all the blood
<A NAME="278"></A><BR>Was chilled with fear.  Low to his soul he said:
<A NAME="279"></A><BR>"Ne'er shall I see return alive from war
<A NAME="280"></A><BR>Penthesileia!"  On that selfsame day
<A NAME="281"></A><BR>The Fates prepared his boding to fulfil;
<A NAME="282"></A><BR>And his heart brake with anguish of despair.
<A NAME="283"></A><BR><BR>Marvelled the Argives, far across the plain
<A NAME="284"></A><BR>Seeing the hosts of Troy charge down on them,
<A NAME="285"></A><BR>And midst them Penthesileia, Ares' child.
<A NAME="286"></A><BR>These seemed like ravening beasts that mid the hills
<A NAME="287"></A><BR>Bring grimly slaughter to the fleecy flocks;
<A NAME="288"></A><BR>And she, as a rushing blast of flame she seemed
<A NAME="289"></A><BR>That maddeneth through the copses summer-scorched,
<A NAME="290"></A><BR>When the wind drives it on; and in this wise
<A NAME="291"></A><BR>Spake one to other in their mustering host:
<A NAME="292"></A><BR>"Who shall this be who thus can rouse to war
<A NAME="293"></A><BR>The Trojans, now that Hector hath been slain --
<A NAME="294"></A><BR>These who, we said, would never more find heart
<A NAME="295"></A><BR>To stand against us?  Lo now, suddenly
<A NAME="296"></A><BR>Forth are they rushing, madly afire for fight!
<A NAME="297"></A><BR>Sure, in their midst some great one kindleth them
<A NAME="298"></A><BR>To battle's toil!  Thou verily wouldst say
<A NAME="299"></A><BR>This were a God, of such great deeds he dreams!
<A NAME="300"></A><BR>Go to, with aweless courage let us arm
<A NAME="301"></A><BR>Our own breasts: let us summon up our might
<A NAME="302"></A><BR>In battle-fury.  We shall lack not help
<A NAME="303"></A><BR>Of Gods this day to close in fight with Troy."
<A NAME="304"></A><BR><BR>So cried they; and their flashing battle-gear
<A NAME="305"></A><BR>Cast they about them: forth the ships they poured
<A NAME="306"></A><BR>Clad in the rage of fight as with a cloak.
<A NAME="307"></A><BR>Then front to front their battles closed, like beasts
<A NAME="308"></A><BR>Of ravin, locked in tangle of gory strife.
<A NAME="309"></A><BR>Clanged their bright mail together, clashed the 
<A NAME="310"></A>spears,
<A NAME="311"></A><BR>The corslets, and the stubborn-welded shields
<A NAME="312"></A><BR>And adamant helms.  Each stabbed at other's flesh
<A NAME="313"></A><BR>With the fierce brass: was neither ruth nor rest,
<A NAME="314"></A><BR>And all the Trojan soil was crimson-red.
<A NAME="315"></A><BR><BR>Then first Penthesileia smote and slew
<A NAME="316"></A><BR>Molion; now Persinous falls, and now
<A NAME="317"></A><BR>Eilissus; reeled Antitheus 'neath her spear
<A NAME="318"></A><BR>The pride of Lernus quelled she: down she bore
<A NAME="319"></A><BR>Hippalmus 'neath her horse-hoofs; Haemon's son
<A NAME="320"></A><BR>Died; withered stalwart Elasippus' strength.
<A NAME="321"></A><BR>And Derinoe laid low Laogonus,
<A NAME="322"></A><BR>And Clonie Menippus, him who sailed
<A NAME="323"></A><BR>Long since from Phylace, led by his lord
<A NAME="324"></A><BR>Protesilaus to the war with Troy.
<A NAME="325"></A><BR>Then was Podarces, son of Iphiclus,
<A NAME="326"></A><BR>Heart-wrung with ruth and wrath to see him lie
<A NAME="327"></A><BR>Dead, of all battle-comrades best-beloved.
<A NAME="328"></A><BR>Swiftly at Clonie he hurled, the maid
<A NAME="329"></A><BR>Fair as a Goddess: plunged the unswerving lance
<A NAME="330"></A><BR>'Twixt hip and hip, and rushed the dark blood forth
<A NAME="331"></A><BR>After the spear, and all her bowels gushed out.
<A NAME="332"></A><BR>Then wroth was Penthesileia; through the brawn
<A NAME="333"></A><BR>Of his right arm she drave the long spear's point,
<A NAME="334"></A><BR>She shore atwain the great blood-brimming veins,
<A NAME="335"></A><BR>And through the wide gash of the wound the gore
<A NAME="336"></A><BR>Spirted, a crimson fountain.  With a groan
<A NAME="337"></A><BR>Backward he sprang, his courage wholly quelled
<A NAME="338"></A><BR>By bitter pain; and sorrow and dismay
<A NAME="339"></A><BR>Thrilled, as he fled, his men of Phylace.
<A NAME="340"></A><BR>A short way from the fight he reeled aside,
<A NAME="341"></A><BR>And in his friends' arms died in little space.
<A NAME="342"></A><BR>Then with his lance Idomeneus thrust out,
<A NAME="343"></A><BR>And by the right breast stabbed Bremusa.  Stilled
<A NAME="344"></A><BR>For ever was the beating of her heart.
<A NAME="345"></A><BR>She fell, as falls a graceful-shafted pine
<A NAME="346"></A><BR>Hewn mid the hills by woodmen: heavily,
<A NAME="347"></A><BR>Sighing through all its boughs, it crashes down.
<A NAME="348"></A><BR>So with a wailing shriek she fell, and death
<A NAME="349"></A><BR>Unstrung her every limb: her breathing soul
<A NAME="350"></A><BR>Mingled with multitudinous-sighing winds.
<A NAME="351"></A><BR>Then, as Evandre through the murderous fray
<A NAME="352"></A><BR>With Thermodosa rushed, stood Meriones,
<A NAME="353"></A><BR>A lion in the path, and slew: his spear
<A NAME="354"></A><BR>Right to the heart of one he drave, and one
<A NAME="355"></A><BR>Stabbed with a lightning sword-thrust 'twixt the 
<A NAME="356"></A>hips:
<A NAME="357"></A><BR>Leapt through the wounds the life, and fled away.
<A NAME="358"></A><BR>Oileus' fiery son smote Derinoe
<A NAME="359"></A><BR>'Twixt throat and shoulder with his ruthless spear;
<A NAME="360"></A><BR>And on Alcibie Tydeus' terrible son
<A NAME="361"></A><BR>Swooped, and on Derimacheia: head with neck
<A NAME="362"></A><BR>Clean from the shoulders of these twain he shore
<A NAME="363"></A><BR>With ruin-wreaking brand.  Together down
<A NAME="364"></A><BR>Fell they, as young calves by the massy axe
<A NAME="365"></A><BR>Of brawny flesher felled, that, shearing through
<A NAME="366"></A><BR>The sinews of the neck, lops life away.
<A NAME="367"></A><BR>So, by the hands of Tydeus' son laid low
<A NAME="368"></A><BR>Upon the Trojan plain, far, far away
<A NAME="369"></A><BR>From their own highland-home, they fell.  Nor these
<A NAME="370"></A><BR>Alone died; for the might of Sthenelus
<A NAME="371"></A><BR>Down on them hurled Cabeirus' corse, who came
<A NAME="372"></A><BR>From Sestos, keen to fight the Argive foe,
<A NAME="373"></A><BR>But never saw his fatherland again.
<A NAME="374"></A><BR>Then was the heart of Paris filled with wrath
<A NAME="375"></A><BR>For a friend slain.  Full upon Sthenelus
<A NAME="376"></A><BR>Aimed he a shaft death-winged, yet touched him not,
<A NAME="377"></A><BR>Despite his thirst for vengeance: otherwhere
<A NAME="378"></A><BR>The arrow glanced aside, and carried death
<A NAME="379"></A><BR>Whither the stern Fates guided its fierce wing,
<A NAME="380"></A><BR>And slew Evenor brazen-tasleted,
<A NAME="381"></A><BR>Who from Dulichium came to war with Troy.
<A NAME="382"></A><BR>For his death fury-kindled was the son
<A NAME="383"></A><BR>Of haughty Phyleus: as a lion leaps
<A NAME="384"></A><BR>Upon the flock, so swiftly rushed he: all
<A NAME="385"></A><BR>Shrank huddling back before that terrible man.
<A NAME="386"></A><BR>Itymoneus he slew, and Hippasus' son
<A NAME="387"></A><BR>Agelaus: from Miletus brought they war
<A NAME="388"></A><BR>Against the Danaan men by Nastes led,
<A NAME="389"></A><BR>The god-like, and Amphimachus mighty-souled.
<A NAME="390"></A><BR>On Mycale they dwelt; beside their home
<A NAME="391"></A><BR>Rose Latmus' snowy crests, stretched the long glens
<A NAME="392"></A><BR>Of Branchus, and Panormus' water-meads.
<A NAME="393"></A><BR>Maeander's flood deep-rolling swept thereby,
<A NAME="394"></A><BR>Which from the Phrygian uplands, pastured o'er
<A NAME="395"></A><BR>By myriad flocks, around a thousand forelands
<A NAME="396"></A><BR>Curls, swirls, and drives his hurrying ripples on
<A NAME="397"></A><BR>Down to the vine-clad land of Carian men
<A NAME="398"></A><BR>These mid the storm of battle Meges slew,
<A NAME="399"></A><BR>Nor these alone, but whomsoe'er his lance
<A NAME="400"></A><BR>Black-shafted touched, were dead men; for his breast
<A NAME="401"></A><BR>The glorious Trito-born with courage thrilled
<A NAME="402"></A><BR>To bring to all his foes the day of doom.
<A NAME="403"></A><BR>And Polypoetes, dear to Ares, slew
<A NAME="404"></A><BR>Dresaeus, whom the Nymph Neaera bare
<A NAME="405"></A><BR>To passing-wise Theiodamas for these
<A NAME="406"></A><BR>Spread was the bed of love beside the foot
<A NAME="407"></A><BR>Of Sipylus the Mountain, where the Gods
<A NAME="408"></A><BR>Made Niobe a stony rock, wherefrom
<A NAME="409"></A><BR>Tears ever stream: high up, the rugged crag
<A NAME="410"></A><BR>Bows as one weeping, weeping, waterfalls
<A NAME="411"></A><BR>Cry from far-echoing Hermus, wailing moan
<A NAME="412"></A><BR>Of sympathy: the sky-encountering crests
<A NAME="413"></A><BR>Of Sipylus, where alway floats a mist
<A NAME="414"></A><BR>Hated of shepherds, echo back the cry.
<A NAME="415"></A><BR>Weird marvel seems that Rock of Niobe
<A NAME="416"></A><BR>To men that pass with feet fear-goaded: there
<A NAME="417"></A><BR>They see the likeness of a woman bowed,
<A NAME="418"></A><BR>In depths of anguish sobbing, and her tears
<A NAME="419"></A><BR>Drop, as she mourns grief-stricken, endlessly.
<A NAME="420"></A><BR>Yea, thou wouldst say that verily so it was,
<A NAME="421"></A><BR>Viewing it from afar; but when hard by
<A NAME="422"></A><BR>Thou standest, all the illusion vanishes;
<A NAME="423"></A><BR>And lo, a steep-browed rock, a fragment rent
<A NAME="424"></A><BR>From Sipylus -- yet Niobe is there,
<A NAME="425"></A><BR>Dreeing her weird, the debt of wrath divine,
<A NAME="426"></A><BR>A broken heart in guise of shattered stone.
<A NAME="427"></A><BR><BR>All through the tangle of that desperate fray
<A NAME="428"></A><BR>Stalked slaughter and doom.  The incarnate Onset-shout
<A NAME="429"></A><BR>Raved through the rolling battle; at her side
<A NAME="430"></A><BR>Paced Death the ruthless, and the Fearful Faces,
<A NAME="431"></A><BR>The Fates, beside them strode, and in red hands
<A NAME="432"></A><BR>Bare murder and the groans of dying men.
<A NAME="433"></A><BR>That day the beating of full many a heart,
<A NAME="434"></A><BR>Trojan and Argive, was for ever stilled,
<A NAME="435"></A><BR>While roared the battle round them, while the fury
<A NAME="436"></A><BR>Of Penthesileia fainted not nor failed;
<A NAME="437"></A><BR>But as amid long ridges of lone hills
<A NAME="438"></A><BR>A lioness, stealing down a deep ravine,
<A NAME="439"></A><BR>Springs on the kine with lightning leap, athirst
<A NAME="440"></A><BR>For blood wherein her fierce heart revelleth;
<A NAME="441"></A><BR>So on the Danaans leapt that warrior-maid.
<A NAME="442"></A><BR>And they, their souls were cowed: backward they 
<A NAME="443"></A>shrank,
<A NAME="444"></A><BR>And fast she followed, as a towering surge
<A NAME="445"></A><BR>Chases across the thunder-booming sea
<A NAME="446"></A><BR>A flying bark, whose white sails strain beneath
<A NAME="447"></A><BR>The wind's wild buffering, and all the air
<A NAME="448"></A><BR>Maddens with roaring, as the rollers crash
<A NAME="449"></A><BR>On a black foreland looming on the lee
<A NAME="450"></A><BR>Where long reefs fringe the surf-tormented shores.
<A NAME="451"></A><BR>So chased she, and so dashed the ranks asunder
<A NAME="452"></A><BR>Triumphant-souled, and hurled fierce threats before:
<A NAME="453"></A><BR>"Ye dogs, this day for evil outrage done
<A NAME="454"></A><BR>To Priam shall ye pay!  No man of you
<A NAME="455"></A><BR>Shall from mine hands deliver his own life,
<A NAME="456"></A><BR>And win back home, to gladden parents eyes,
<A NAME="457"></A><BR>Or comfort wife or children.  Ye shall lie
<A NAME="458"></A><BR>Dead, ravined on by vultures and by wolves,
<A NAME="459"></A><BR>And none shall heap the earth-mound o'er your clay.
<A NAME="460"></A><BR>Where skulketh now the strength of Tydeus' son,
<A NAME="461"></A><BR>And where the might of Aeacus' scion?
<A NAME="462"></A><BR>Where is Aias' bulk?  Ye vaunt them mightiest men
<A NAME="463"></A><BR>Of all your rabble.  Ha!  they will not dare
<A NAME="464"></A><BR>With me to close in battle, lest I drag
<A NAME="465"></A><BR>Forth from their fainting frames their craven souls!"
<A NAME="466"></A><BR><BR>Then heart-uplifted leapt she on the foe,
<A NAME="467"></A><BR>Resistless as a tigress, crashing through
<A NAME="468"></A><BR>Ranks upon ranks of Argives, smiting now
<A NAME="469"></A><BR>With that huge halberd massy-headed, now
<A NAME="470"></A><BR>Hurling the keen dart, while her battle-horse
<A NAME="471"></A><BR>Flashed through the fight, and on his shoulder bare
<A NAME="472"></A><BR>Quiver and bow death-speeding, close to her hand,
<A NAME="473"></A><BR>If mid that revel of blood she willed to speed
<A NAME="474"></A><BR>The bitter-biting shaft.  Behind her swept
<A NAME="475"></A><BR>The charging lines of men fleet-footed, friends
<A NAME="476"></A><BR>And brethren of the man who never flinched
<A NAME="477"></A><BR>From close death-grapple, Hector, panting all
<A NAME="478"></A><BR>The hot breath of the War-god from their breasts,
<A NAME="479"></A><BR>All slaying Danaans with the ashen spear,
<A NAME="480"></A><BR>Who fell as frost-touched leaves in autumn fall
<A NAME="481"></A><BR>One after other, or as drops of rain.
<A NAME="482"></A><BR>And aye went up a moaning from earth's breast
<A NAME="483"></A><BR>All blood-bedrenched, and heaped with corse on corse.
<A NAME="484"></A><BR>Horses pierced through with arrows, or impaled
<A NAME="485"></A><BR>On spears, were snorting forth their last of strength
<A NAME="486"></A><BR>With screaming neighings.  Men, with gnashing teeth
<A NAME="487"></A><BR>Biting the dust, lay gasping, while the steeds
<A NAME="488"></A><BR>Of Trojan charioteers stormed in pursuit,
<A NAME="489"></A><BR>Trampling the dying mingled with the dead
<A NAME="490"></A><BR>As oxen trample corn in threshing-floors.
<A NAME="491"></A><BR><BR>Then one exulting boasted mid the host
<A NAME="492"></A><BR>Of Troy, beholding Penthesileia rush
<A NAME="493"></A><BR>On through the foes' array, like the black storm
<A NAME="494"></A><BR>That maddens o'er the sea, what time the sun
<A NAME="495"></A><BR>Allies his might with winter's Goat-horned Star;
<A NAME="496"></A><BR>And thus, puffed up with vain hope, shouted he:
<A NAME="497"></A><BR>"O friends, in manifest presence down from heaven
<A NAME="498"></A><BR>One of the deathless Gods this day hath come
<A NAME="499"></A><BR>To fight the Argives, all of love for us,
<A NAME="500"></A><BR>Yea, and with sanction of almighty Zeus,
<A NAME="501"></A><BR>He whose compassion now remembereth
<A NAME="502"></A><BR>Haply strong-hearted Priam, who may boast
<A NAME="503"></A><BR>For his a lineage of immortal blood.
<A NAME="504"></A><BR>For this, I trow, no mortal woman seems,
<A NAME="505"></A><BR>Who is so aweless-daring, who is clad
<A NAME="506"></A><BR>In splendour-flashing arms: nay, surely she
<A NAME="507"></A><BR>Shall be Athene, or the mighty-souled
<A NAME="508"></A><BR>Enyo -- haply Eris, or the Child
<A NAME="509"></A><BR>Of Leto world-renowned.  O yea, I look
<A NAME="510"></A><BR>To see her hurl amid yon Argive men
<A NAME="511"></A><BR>Mad-shrieking slaughter, see her set aflame
<A NAME="512"></A><BR>Yon ships wherein they came long years agone
<A NAME="513"></A><BR>Bringing us many sorrows, yea, they came
<A NAME="514"></A><BR>Bringing us woes of war intolerable.
<A NAME="515"></A><BR>Ha!  to the home-land Hellas ne'er shall these
<A NAME="516"></A><BR>With joy return, since Gods on our side fight."
<A NAME="517"></A><BR><BR>In overweening exultation so
<A NAME="518"></A><BR>Vaunted a Trojan.  Fool! -- he had no vision
<A NAME="519"></A><BR>Of ruin onward rushing upon himself
<A NAME="520"></A><BR>And Troy, and Penthesileia's self withal.
<A NAME="521"></A><BR>For not as yet had any tidings come
<A NAME="522"></A><BR>Of that wild fray to Aias stormy-souled,
<A NAME="523"></A><BR>Nor to Achilles, waster of tower and town.
<A NAME="524"></A><BR>But on the grave-mound of Menoetius' son
<A NAME="525"></A><BR>They twain were lying, with sad memories
<A NAME="526"></A><BR>Of a dear comrade crushed, and echoing
<A NAME="527"></A><BR>Each one the other's groaning.  One it was
<A NAME="528"></A><BR>Of the Blest Gods who still was holding back
<A NAME="529"></A><BR>These from the battle-tumult far away,
<A NAME="530"></A><BR>Till many Greeks should fill the measure up
<A NAME="531"></A><BR>Of woeful havoc, slain by Trojan foes
<A NAME="532"></A><BR>And glorious Penthesileia, who pursued
<A NAME="533"></A><BR>With murderous intent their rifled ranks,
<A NAME="534"></A><BR>While ever waxed her valour more and more,
<A NAME="535"></A><BR>And waxed her might within her: never in vain
<A NAME="536"></A><BR>She aimed the unswerving spear-thrust: aye she pierced
<A NAME="537"></A><BR>The backs of them that fled, the breasts of such
<A NAME="538"></A><BR>As charged to meet her.  All the long shaft dripped
<A NAME="539"></A><BR>With steaming blood.  Swift were her feet as wind
<A NAME="540"></A><BR>As down she swooped.  Her aweless spirit failed
<A NAME="541"></A><BR>For weariness nor fainted, but her might
<A NAME="542"></A><BR>Was adamantine.  The impending Doom,
<A NAME="543"></A><BR>Which roused unto the terrible strife not yet
<A NAME="544"></A><BR>Achilles, clothed her still with glory; still
<A NAME="545"></A><BR>Aloof the dread Power stood, and still would shed
<A NAME="546"></A><BR>Splendour of triumph o'er the death-ordained
<A NAME="547"></A><BR>But for a little space, ere it should quell
<A NAME="548"></A><BR>That Maiden 'neath the hands of Aeaeus' son.
<A NAME="549"></A><BR>In darkness ambushed, with invisible hand
<A NAME="550"></A><BR>Ever it thrust her on, and drew her feet
<A NAME="551"></A><BR>Destruction-ward, and lit her path to death
<A NAME="552"></A><BR>With glory, while she slew foe after foe.
<A NAME="553"></A><BR>As when within a dewy garden-close,
<A NAME="554"></A><BR>Longing for its green springtide freshness, leaps
<A NAME="555"></A><BR>A heifer, and there rangeth to and fro,
<A NAME="556"></A><BR>When none is by to stay her, treading down
<A NAME="557"></A><BR>All its green herbs, and all its wealth of bloom,
<A NAME="558"></A><BR>Devouring greedily this, and marring that
<A NAME="559"></A><BR>With trampling feet; so ranged she, Ares' child,
<A NAME="560"></A><BR>Through reeling squadrons of Achaea's sons,
<A NAME="561"></A><BR>Slew these, and hunted those in panic rout.
<A NAME="562"></A><BR><BR>From Troy afar the women marvelling gazed
<A NAME="563"></A><BR>At the Maid's battle-prowess.  Suddenly
<A NAME="564"></A><BR>A fiery passion for the fray hath seized
<A NAME="565"></A><BR>Antimachus' daughter, Meneptolemus' wife,
<A NAME="566"></A><BR>Tisiphone.  Her heart waxed strong, and filled
<A NAME="567"></A><BR>With lust of fight she cried to her fellows all,
<A NAME="568"></A><BR>With desperate-daring words, to spur them on
<A NAME="569"></A><BR>To woeful war, by recklessness made strong.
<A NAME="570"></A><BR>"Friends, let a heart of valour in our breasts
<A NAME="571"></A><BR>Awake!  Let us be like our lords, who fight
<A NAME="572"></A><BR>With foes for fatherland, for babes, for us,
<A NAME="573"></A><BR>And never pause for breath in that stern strife!
<A NAME="574"></A><BR>Let us too throne war's spirit in our hearts!
<A NAME="575"></A><BR>Let us too face the fight which favoureth none!
<A NAME="576"></A><BR>For we, we women, be not creatures cast
<A NAME="577"></A><BR>In diverse mould from men: to us is given
<A NAME="578"></A><BR>Such energy of life as stirs in them.
<A NAME="579"></A><BR>Eyes have we like to theirs, and limbs: throughout
<A NAME="580"></A><BR>Fashioned we are alike: one common light
<A NAME="581"></A><BR>We look on, and one common air we breathe:
<A NAME="582"></A><BR>With like food are we nourished --  nay, wherein
<A NAME="583"></A><BR>Have we been dowered of God more niggardly
<A NAME="584"></A><BR>Than men?  Then let us shrink not from the fray
<A NAME="585"></A><BR>See ye not yonder a woman far excelling
<A NAME="586"></A><BR>Men in the grapple of fight?  Yet is her blood
<A NAME="587"></A><BR>Nowise akin to ours, nor fighteth she
<A NAME="588"></A><BR>For her own city.  For an alien king
<A NAME="589"></A><BR>She warreth of her own heart's prompting, fears
<A NAME="590"></A><BR>The face of no man; for her soul is thrilled
<A NAME="591"></A><BR>With valour and with spirit invincible.
<A NAME="592"></A><BR>But we -- to right, to left, lie woes on woes
<A NAME="593"></A><BR>About our feet: this mourns beloved sons,
<A NAME="594"></A><BR>And that a husband who for hearth and home
<A NAME="595"></A><BR>Hath died; some wail for fathers now no more;
<A NAME="596"></A><BR>Some grieve for brethren and for kinsmen lost.
<A NAME="597"></A><BR>Not one but hath some share in sorrow's cup.
<A NAME="598"></A><BR>Behind all this a fearful shadow looms,
<A NAME="599"></A><BR>The day of bondage!  Therefore flinch not ye
<A NAME="600"></A><BR>From war, O sorrow-laden!  Better far
<A NAME="601"></A><BR>To die in battle now, than afterwards
<A NAME="602"></A><BR>Hence to be haled into captivity
<A NAME="603"></A><BR>To alien folk, we and our little ones,
<A NAME="604"></A><BR>In the stern grip of fate leaving behind
<A NAME="605"></A><BR>A burning city, and our husbands' graves."
<A NAME="606"></A><BR><BR>So cried she, and with passion for stern war
<A NAME="607"></A><BR>Thrilled all those women; and with eager speed
<A NAME="608"></A><BR>They hasted to go forth without the wall
<A NAME="609"></A><BR>Mail-clad, afire to battle for their town
<A NAME="610"></A><BR>And people: all their spirit was aflame.
<A NAME="611"></A><BR>As when within a hive, when winter-tide
<A NAME="612"></A><BR>Is over and gone, loud hum the swarming bees
<A NAME="613"></A><BR>What time they make them ready forth to fare
<A NAME="614"></A><BR>To bright flower-pastures, and no more endure
<A NAME="615"></A><BR>To linger therewithin, but each to other
<A NAME="616"></A><BR>Crieth the challenge-cry to sally forth;
<A NAME="617"></A><BR>Even so bestirred themselves the women of Troy,
<A NAME="618"></A><BR>And kindled each her sister to the fray.
<A NAME="619"></A><BR>The weaving-wool, the distaff far they flung,
<A NAME="620"></A><BR>And to grim weapons stretched their eager hands.
<A NAME="621"></A><BR><BR>And now without the city these had died
<A NAME="622"></A><BR>In that wild battle, as their husbands died
<A NAME="623"></A><BR>And the strong Amazons died, had not one voice
<A NAME="624"></A><BR>Of wisdom cried to stay their maddened feet,
<A NAME="625"></A><BR>When with dissuading words Theano spake:
<A NAME="626"></A><BR>"Wherefore, ah wherefore for the toil and strain
<A NAME="627"></A><BR>Of battle's fearful tumult do ye yearn,
<A NAME="628"></A><BR>Infatuate ones?  Never your limbs have toiled
<A NAME="629"></A><BR>In conflict yet.  In utter ignoranee
<A NAME="630"></A><BR>Panting for labour unendurable,
<A NAME="631"></A><BR>Ye rush on all-unthinking; for your strength
<A NAME="632"></A><BR>Can never be as that of Danaan men,
<A NAME="633"></A><BR>Men trained in daily battle.  Amazons
<A NAME="634"></A><BR>Have joyed in ruthless fight, in charging steeds,
<A NAME="635"></A><BR>From the beginning: all the toil of men
<A NAME="636"></A><BR>Do they endure; and therefore evermore
<A NAME="637"></A><BR>The spirit of the War-god thrills them through.
<A NAME="638"></A><BR>'They fall not short of men in anything:
<A NAME="639"></A><BR>Their labour-hardened frames make great their hearts
<A NAME="640"></A><BR>For all achievement: never faint their knees
<A NAME="641"></A><BR>Nor tremble.  Rumour speaks their queen to be
<A NAME="642"></A><BR>A daughter of the mighty Lord of War.
<A NAME="643"></A><BR>Therefore no woman may compare with her
<A NAME="644"></A><BR>In prowess -- if she be a woman, not
<A NAME="645"></A><BR>A God come down in answer to our prayers.
<A NAME="646"></A><BR>Yea, of one blood be all the race of men,
<A NAME="647"></A><BR>Yet unto diverse labours still they turn;
<A NAME="648"></A><BR>And that for each is evermore the best
<A NAME="649"></A><BR>Whereto he bringeth skill of use and wont.
<A NAME="650"></A><BR>Therefore do ye from tumult of the fray
<A NAME="651"></A><BR>Hold you aloof, and in your women's bowers
<A NAME="652"></A><BR>Before the loom still pace ye to and fro;
<A NAME="653"></A><BR>And war shall be the business of our lords.
<A NAME="654"></A><BR>Lo, of fair issue is there hope: we see
<A NAME="655"></A><BR>The Achaeans falling fast: we see the might
<A NAME="656"></A><BR>Of our men waxing ever: fear is none
<A NAME="657"></A><BR>Of evil issue now: the pitiless foe
<A NAME="658"></A><BR>Beleaguer not the town: no desperate need
<A NAME="659"></A><BR>There is that women should go forth to war."
<A NAME="660"></A><BR><BR>So cried she, and they hearkened to the words
<A NAME="661"></A><BR>Of her who had garnered wisdom from the years;
<A NAME="662"></A><BR>So from afar they watched the fight.  But still
<A NAME="663"></A><BR>Penthesileia brake the ranks, and still
<A NAME="664"></A><BR>Before her quailed the Achaeans: still they found
<A NAME="665"></A><BR>Nor screen nor hiding-place from imminent death.
<A NAME="666"></A><BR>As bleating goats are by the blood-stained jaws
<A NAME="667"></A><BR>Of a grim panther torn, so slain were they.
<A NAME="668"></A><BR>In each man's heart all lust of battle died,
<A NAME="669"></A><BR>And fear alone lived.  This way, that way fled
<A NAME="670"></A><BR>The panic-stricken: some to earth had flung
<A NAME="671"></A><BR>The armour from their shoulders; some in dust
<A NAME="672"></A><BR>Grovelled in terror 'neath their shields: the steeds
<A NAME="673"></A><BR>Fled through the rout unreined of charioteers.
<A NAME="674"></A><BR>In rapture of triumph charged the Amazons,
<A NAME="675"></A><BR>With groan and scream of agony died the Greeks.
<A NAME="676"></A><BR>Withered their manhood was in that sore strait;
<A NAME="677"></A><BR>Brief was the span of all whom that fierce maid
<A NAME="678"></A><BR>Mid the grim jaws of battle overtook.
<A NAME="679"></A><BR>As when with mighty roaring bursteth down
<A NAME="680"></A><BR>A storm upon the forest-trees, and some
<A NAME="681"></A><BR>Uprendeth by the roots, and on the earth
<A NAME="682"></A><BR>Dashes them down, the tail stems blossom-crowned,
<A NAME="683"></A><BR>And snappeth some athwart the trunk, and high
<A NAME="684"></A><BR>Whirls them through air, till all confused they 
<A NAME="685"></A>lie
<A NAME="686"></A><BR>A ruin of splintered stems and shattered sprays;
<A NAME="687"></A><BR>So the great Danaan host lay, dashed to dust
<A NAME="688"></A><BR>By doom of Fate, by Penthesileia's spear.
<A NAME="689"></A><BR><BR>But when the very ships were now at point
<A NAME="690"></A><BR>To be by hands of Trojans set aflame,
<A NAME="691"></A><BR>Then battle-bider Aias heard afar
<A NAME="692"></A><BR>The panic-cries, and spake to Aeacus' son:
<A NAME="693"></A><BR>"Achilles, all the air about mine ears
<A NAME="694"></A><BR>Is full of multitudinous eries, is full
<A NAME="695"></A><BR>Of thunder of battle rolling nearer aye.
<A NAME="696"></A><BR>Let us go forth then, ere the Trojans win
<A NAME="697"></A><BR>Unto the ships, and make great slaughter there
<A NAME="698"></A><BR>Of Argive men, and set the ships aflame.
<A NAME="699"></A><BR>Foulest reproach such thing on thee and me
<A NAME="700"></A><BR>Should bring; for it beseems not that the seed
<A NAME="701"></A><BR>Of mighty Zeus should shame the sacred blood
<A NAME="702"></A><BR>Of hero-fathers, who themselves of old
<A NAME="703"></A><BR>With Hercules the battle-eager sailed
<A NAME="704"></A><BR>To Troy, and smote her even at her height
<A NAME="705"></A><BR>Of glory, when Laomedon was king.
<A NAME="706"></A><BR>Ay, and I ween that our hands even now
<A NAME="707"></A><BR>Shall do the like: we too are mighty men."
<A NAME="708"></A><BR><BR>He spake: the aweless strength of Aeacus' son
<A NAME="709"></A><BR>Hearkened thereto, for also to his ears
<A NAME="710"></A><BR>By this the roar of bitter battle came.
<A NAME="711"></A><BR>Then hasted both, and donned their warrior-gear
<A NAME="712"></A><BR>All splendour-gleaming: now, in these arrayed
<A NAME="713"></A><BR>Facing that stormy-tossing rout they stand.
<A NAME="714"></A><BR>Loud clashed their glorious armour: in their souls
<A NAME="715"></A><BR>A battle-fury like the War-god's wrath
<A NAME="716"></A><BR>Maddened; such might was breathed into these twain
<A NAME="717"></A><BR>By Atrytone, Shaker of the Shield,
<A NAME="718"></A><BR>As on they pressed.  With joy the Argives saw
<A NAME="719"></A><BR>The coming of that mighty twain: they seemed
<A NAME="720"></A><BR>In semblance like A1oeus' giant sons
<A NAME="721"></A><BR>Who in the old time made that haughty vaunt
<A NAME="722"></A><BR>Of piling on Olympus' brow the height
<A NAME="723"></A><BR>Of Ossa steeply-towering, and the crest
<A NAME="724"></A><BR>Of sky-encountering Pelion, so to rear
<A NAME="725"></A><BR>A mountain-stair for their rebellious rage
<A NAME="726"></A><BR>To scale the highest heaven.  Huge as these
<A NAME="727"></A><BR>The sons of Aeacus seemed, as forth they strode
<A NAME="728"></A><BR>To stem the tide of war.  A gladsome sight
<A NAME="729"></A><BR>To friends who have fainted for their coming, now
<A NAME="730"></A><BR>Onward they press to crush triumphant foes.
<A NAME="731"></A><BR>Many they slew with their resistless spears;
<A NAME="732"></A><BR>As when two herd-destroying lions come
<A NAME="733"></A><BR>On sheep amid the copses feeding, far
<A NAME="734"></A><BR>From help of shepherds, and in heaps on heaps
<A NAME="735"></A><BR>Slay them, till they have drunken to the full
<A NAME="736"></A><BR>Of blood, and filled their maws insatiate
<A NAME="737"></A><BR>With flesh, so those destroyers twain slew on,
<A NAME="738"></A><BR>Spreading wide havoc through the hosts of Troy.
<A NAME="739"></A><BR><BR>There Deiochus and gallant Hyllus fell
<A NAME="740"></A><BR>By Alas slain, and fell Eurynomus
<A NAME="741"></A><BR>Lover of war, and goodly Enyeus died.
<A NAME="742"></A><BR>But Peleus' son burst on the Amazons
<A NAME="743"></A><BR>Smiting Antandre, Polemusa then,
<A NAME="744"></A><BR>Antibrote, fierce-souled Hippothoe,
<A NAME="745"></A><BR>Hurling Harmothoe down on sisters slain.
<A NAME="746"></A><BR>Then hard on all their-reeling ranks he pressed
<A NAME="747"></A><BR>With Telamon's mighty-hearted son; and now
<A NAME="748"></A><BR>Before their hands battalions dense and strong
<A NAME="749"></A><BR>Crumbled as weakly and as suddenly
<A NAME="750"></A><BR>As when in mountain-folds the forest-brakes
<A NAME="751"></A><BR>Shrivel before a tempest-driven fire.
<A NAME="752"></A><BR><BR>When battle-eager Penthesileia saw
<A NAME="753"></A><BR>These twain, as through the scourging storm of war
<A NAME="754"></A><BR>Like ravening beasts they rushed, to meet them there
<A NAME="755"></A><BR>She sped, as when a leopard grim, whose mood
<A NAME="756"></A><BR>Is deadly, leaps from forest-coverts forth,
<A NAME="757"></A><BR>Lashing her tail, on hunters closing round,
<A NAME="758"></A><BR>While these, in armour clad, and putting trust
<A NAME="759"></A><BR>In their long spears, await her lightning leap;
<A NAME="760"></A><BR>So did those warriors twain with spears upswung
<A NAME="761"></A><BR>Wait Penthesileia.  Clanged the brazen plates
<A NAME="762"></A><BR>About their shoulders as they moved.  And first
<A NAME="763"></A><BR>Leapt the long-shafted lance sped from the hand
<A NAME="764"></A><BR>Of goodly Penthesileia.  Straight it flew
<A NAME="765"></A><BR>To the shield of Aeacus' son, but glancing thence
<A NAME="766"></A><BR>This way and that the shivered fragments sprang
<A NAME="767"></A><BR>As from a rock-face: of such temper were
<A NAME="768"></A><BR>The cunning-hearted Fire-god's gifts divine.
<A NAME="769"></A><BR>Then in her hand the warrior-maid swung up
<A NAME="770"></A><BR>A second javelin fury-winged, against
<A NAME="771"></A><BR>Aias, and with fierce words defied the twain:
<A NAME="772"></A><BR>"Ha, from mine hand in vain one lance hath leapt!
<A NAME="773"></A><BR>But with this second look I suddenly
<A NAME="774"></A><BR>To quell the strength and courage of two foes, --
<A NAME="775"></A><BR>Ay, though ye vaunt you mighty men of war
<A NAME="776"></A><BR>Amid your Danaans!  Die ye shall, and so
<A NAME="777"></A><BR>Lighter shall be the load of war's affliction
<A NAME="778"></A><BR>That lies upon the Trojan chariot-lords.
<A NAME="779"></A><BR>Draw nigh, come through the press to grips with 
<A NAME="780"></A>me,
<A NAME="781"></A><BR>So shall ye learn what might wells up in breasts
<A NAME="782"></A><BR>Of Amazons.  With my blood is mingled war!
<A NAME="783"></A><BR>No mortal man begat me, but the Lord
<A NAME="784"></A><BR>Of War, insatiate of the battle-cry.
<A NAME="785"></A><BR>Therefore my might is more than any man's."
<A NAME="786"></A><BR><BR>With scornful laughter spake she: then she hurled
<A NAME="787"></A><BR>Her second lance; but they in utter scorn
<A NAME="788"></A><BR>Laughed now, as swiftly flew the shaft, and smote
<A NAME="789"></A><BR>The silver greave of Aias, and was foiled
<A NAME="790"></A><BR>Thereby, and all its fury could not scar
<A NAME="791"></A><BR>The flesh within; for fate had ordered not
<A NAME="792"></A><BR>That any blade of foes should taste the blood
<A NAME="793"></A><BR>Of Aias in the bitter war.  But he
<A NAME="794"></A><BR>Recked of the Amazon naught, but turned him thence
<A NAME="795"></A><BR>To rush upon the Trojan host, and left
<A NAME="796"></A><BR>Penthesileia unto Peleus' son
<A NAME="797"></A><BR>Alone, for well he knew his heart within
<A NAME="798"></A><BR>That she, for all her prowess, none the less
<A NAME="799"></A><BR>Would cost Achilles battle-toil as light,
<A NAME="800"></A><BR>As effortless, as doth the dove the hawk.
<A NAME="801"></A><BR><BR>Then groaned she an angry groan that she had 
<A NAME="802"></A>sped
<A NAME="803"></A><BR>Her shafts in vain; and now with scoffing speech
<A NAME="804"></A><BR>To her in turn the son of Peleus spake:
<A NAME="805"></A><BR>"Woman, with what vain vauntings triumphing
<A NAME="806"></A><BR>Hast thou come forth against us, all athirst
<A NAME="807"></A><BR>To battle with us, who be mightier far
<A NAME="808"></A><BR>Than earthborn heroes?  We from Cronos' Son,
<A NAME="809"></A><BR>The Thunder-roller, boast our high descent.
<A NAME="810"></A><BR>Ay, even Hector quailed, the battle-swift,
<A NAME="811"></A><BR>Before us, e'en though far away he saw
<A NAME="812"></A><BR>Our onrush to grim battle.  Yea, my spear
<A NAME="813"></A><BR>Slew him, for all his might.  But thou -- thine 
<A NAME="814"></A>heart
<A NAME="815"></A><BR>Is utterly mad, that thou hast greatly dared
<A NAME="816"></A><BR>To threaten us with death this day!  On thee
<A NAME="817"></A><BR>Thy latest hour shall swiftly come -- is come!
<A NAME="818"></A><BR>Thee not thy sire the War-god now shall pluck
<A NAME="819"></A><BR>Out of mine hand, but thou the debt shalt pay
<A NAME="820"></A><BR>Of a dark doom, as when mid mountain-folds
<A NAME="821"></A><BR>A pricket meets a lion, waster of herds.
<A NAME="822"></A><BR>What, woman, hast thou heard not of the heaps
<A NAME="823"></A><BR>Of slain, that into Xanthus' rushing stream
<A NAME="824"></A><BR>Were thrust by these mine hands? -- or hast thou 
<A NAME="825"></A>heard
<A NAME="826"></A><BR>In vain, because the Blessed Ones have stol'n
<A NAME="827"></A><BR>Wit and discretion from thee, to the end
<A NAME="828"></A><BR>That Doom's relentless gulf might gape for thee?"
<A NAME="829"></A><BR><BR>He spake; he swung up in his mighty hand
<A NAME="830"></A><BR>And sped the long spear warrior-slaying, wrought
<A NAME="831"></A><BR>By Chiron, and above the right breast pierced
<A NAME="832"></A><BR>The battle-eager maid.  The red blood leapt
<A NAME="833"></A><BR>Forth, as a fountain wells, and all at once
<A NAME="834"></A><BR>Fainted the strength of Penthesileia's limbs;
<A NAME="835"></A><BR>Dropped the great battle-axe from her nerveless 
<A NAME="836"></A>hand;
<A NAME="837"></A><BR>A mist of darkness overveiled her eyes,
<A NAME="838"></A><BR>And anguish thrilled her soul.  Yet even so
<A NAME="839"></A><BR>Still drew she difficult breath, still dimly saw
<A NAME="840"></A><BR>The hero, even now in act to drag
<A NAME="841"></A><BR>Her from the swift steed's back.  Confusedly
<A NAME="842"></A><BR>She thought: "Or shall I draw my mighty sword,
<A NAME="843"></A><BR>And bide Achilles' fiery onrush, or
<A NAME="844"></A><BR>Hastily cast me from my fleet horse down
<A NAME="845"></A><BR>To earth, and kneel unto this godlike man,
<A NAME="846"></A><BR>And with wild breath promise for ransoming
<A NAME="847"></A><BR>Great heaps of brass and gold, which pacify
<A NAME="848"></A><BR>The hearts of victors never so athirst
<A NAME="849"></A><BR>For blood, if haply so the murderous might
<A NAME="850"></A><BR>Of Aeacus' son may hearken and may spare,
<A NAME="851"></A><BR>Or peradventure may compassionate
<A NAME="852"></A><BR>My youth, and so vouchsafe me to behold
<A NAME="853"></A><BR>Mine home again? -- for O, I long to live!"
<A NAME="854"></A><BR><BR>So surged the wild thoughts in her; but the 
<A NAME="855"></A>Gods
<A NAME="856"></A><BR>Ordained it otherwise.  Even now rushed on
<A NAME="857"></A><BR>In terrible anger Peleus' son: he thrust
<A NAME="858"></A><BR>With sudden spear, and on its shaft impaled
<A NAME="859"></A><BR>The body of her tempest-footed steed,
<A NAME="860"></A><BR>Even as a man in haste to sup might pierce
<A NAME="861"></A><BR>Flesh with the spit, above the glowing hearth
<A NAME="862"></A><BR>To roast it, or as in a mountain-glade
<A NAME="863"></A><BR>A hunter sends the shaft of death clear through
<A NAME="864"></A><BR>The body of a stag with such winged speed
<A NAME="865"></A><BR>That the fierce dart leaps forth beyond, to plunge
<A NAME="866"></A><BR>Into the tall stem of an oak or pine.
<A NAME="867"></A><BR>So that death-ravening spear of Peleus' son
<A NAME="868"></A><BR>Clear through the goodly steed rushed on, and pierced
<A NAME="869"></A><BR>Penthesileia.  Straightway fell she down
<A NAME="870"></A><BR>Into the dust of earth, the arms of death,
<A NAME="871"></A><BR>In grace and comeliness fell, for naught of shame
<A NAME="872"></A><BR>Dishonoured her fair form.  Face down she lay
<A NAME="873"></A><BR>On the long spear outgasping her last breath,
<A NAME="874"></A><BR>Stretched upon that fleet horse as on a couch;
<A NAME="875"></A><BR>Like some tall pine snapped by the icy mace
<A NAME="876"></A><BR>Of Boreas, earth's forest-fosterling
<A NAME="877"></A><BR>Reared by a spring to stately height, amidst
<A NAME="878"></A><BR>Long mountain-glens, a glory of mother earth;
<A NAME="879"></A><BR>So from the once fleet steed low fallen lay
<A NAME="880"></A><BR>Penthesileia, all her shattered strength
<A NAME="881"></A><BR>Brought down to this, and all her loveliness.
<A NAME="882"></A><BR><BR>Now when the Trojans saw the Warrior-queen
<A NAME="883"></A><BR>Struck down in battle, ran through all their lines
<A NAME="884"></A><BR>A shiver of panic.  Straightway to their walls
<A NAME="885"></A><BR>Turned they in flight, heart-agonized with grief.
<A NAME="886"></A><BR>As when on the wide sea, 'neath buffetings
<A NAME="887"></A><BR>Of storm-blasts, castaways whose ship is wrecked
<A NAME="888"></A><BR>Escape, a remnant of a crew, forspent
<A NAME="889"></A><BR>With desperate conflict with the cruel sea:
<A NAME="890"></A><BR>Late and at last appears the land hard by,
<A NAME="891"></A><BR>Appears a city: faint and weary-limbed
<A NAME="892"></A><BR>With that grim struggle, through the surf they strain
<A NAME="893"></A><BR>To land, sore grieving for the good ship 1ost,
<A NAME="894"></A><BR>And shipmates whom the terrible surge dragged down
<A NAME="895"></A><BR>To nether gloom; so, Troyward as they fled
<A NAME="896"></A><BR>From battle, all those Trojans wept for her,
<A NAME="897"></A><BR>The Child of the resistless War-god, wept
<A NAME="898"></A><BR>For friends who died in groan-resounding fight.
<A NAME="899"></A><BR><BR>Then over her with scornful laugh the son
<A NAME="900"></A><BR>Of Peleus vaunted: "In the dust lie there
<A NAME="901"></A><BR>A prey to teeth of dogs, to ravens' beaks,
<A NAME="902"></A><BR>Thou wretched thing!  Who cozened thee to come
<A NAME="903"></A><BR>Forth against me?  And thoughtest thou to fare
<A NAME="904"></A><BR>Home from the war alive, to bear with thee
<A NAME="905"></A><BR>Right royal gifts from Priam the old king,
<A NAME="906"></A><BR>Thy guerdon for slain Argives?  Ha, 'twas not
<A NAME="907"></A><BR>The Immortals who inspired thee with this thought,
<A NAME="908"></A><BR>Who know that I of heroes mightiest am,
<A NAME="909"></A><BR>The Danaans' light of safety, but a woe
<A NAME="910"></A><BR>To Trojans and to thee, O evil-starred!
<A NAME="911"></A><BR>Nay, but it was the darkness-shrouded Fates
<A NAME="912"></A><BR>And thine own folly of soul that pricked thee on
<A NAME="913"></A><BR>To leave the works of women, and to fare
<A NAME="914"></A><BR>To war, from which strong men shrink shuddering 
<A NAME="915"></A>back."
<A NAME="916"></A><BR><BR>So spake he, and his ashen spear the son
<A NAME="917"></A><BR>Of Peleus drew from that swift horse, and from
<A NAME="918"></A><BR>Penthesileia in death's agony.
<A NAME="919"></A><BR>Then steed and rider gasped their lives away
<A NAME="920"></A><BR>Slain by one spear.  Now from her head he plucked
<A NAME="921"></A><BR>The helmet splendour-flashing like the beams
<A NAME="922"></A><BR>Of the great sun, or Zeus' own glory-light.
<A NAME="923"></A><BR>Then, there as fallen in dust and blood she lay,
<A NAME="924"></A><BR>Rose, like the breaking of the dawn, to view
<A NAME="925"></A><BR>'Neath dainty-pencilled brows a lovely face,
<A NAME="926"></A><BR>Lovely in death.  The Argives thronged around,
<A NAME="927"></A><BR>And all they saw and marvelled, for she seemed
<A NAME="928"></A><BR>Like an Immortal.  In her armour there
<A NAME="929"></A><BR>Upon the earth she lay, and seemed the Child
<A NAME="930"></A><BR>Of Zeus, the tireless Huntress Artemis
<A NAME="931"></A><BR>Sleeping, what time her feet forwearied are
<A NAME="932"></A><BR>With following lions with her flying shafts
<A NAME="933"></A><BR>Over the hills far-stretching.  She was made
<A NAME="934"></A><BR>A wonder of beauty even in her death
<A NAME="935"></A><BR>By Aphrodite glorious-crowned, the Bride
<A NAME="936"></A><BR>Of the strong War-god, to the end that he,
<A NAME="937"></A><BR>The son of noble Peleus, might be pierced
<A NAME="938"></A><BR>With the sharp arrow of repentant love.
<A NAME="939"></A><BR>The warriors gazed, and in their hearts they prayed
<A NAME="940"></A><BR>That fair and sweet like her their wives might seem,
<A NAME="941"></A><BR>Laid on the bed of love, when home they won.
<A NAME="942"></A><BR>Yea, and Achilles' very heart was wrung
<A NAME="943"></A><BR>With love's remorse to have slain a thing so sweet,
<A NAME="944"></A><BR>Who might have borne her home, his queenly bride,
<A NAME="945"></A><BR>To chariot-glorious Phthia; for she was
<A NAME="946"></A><BR>Flawless, a very daughter of the Gods,
<A NAME="947"></A><BR>Divinely tall, and most divinely fair.
<A NAME="948"></A><BR><BR>Then Ares' heart was thrilled with grief and 
<A NAME="949"></A>rage
<A NAME="950"></A><BR>For his child slain.  Straight from Olympus down
<A NAME="951"></A><BR>He darted, swift and bright as thunderbolt
<A NAME="952"></A><BR>Terribly flashing from the mighty hand Of
<A NAME="953"></A><BR>Zeus, far leaping o'er the trackless sea,
<A NAME="954"></A><BR>Or flaming o'er the land, while shuddereth
<A NAME="955"></A><BR>All wide Olympus as it passeth by.
<A NAME="956"></A><BR>So through the quivering air with heart aflame
<A NAME="957"></A><BR>Swooped Ares armour-clad, soon as he heard
<A NAME="958"></A><BR>The dread doom of his daughter.  For the Gales,
<A NAME="959"></A><BR>The North-wind's fleet-winged daughters, bare to 
<A NAME="960"></A>him,
<A NAME="961"></A><BR>As through the wide halls of the sky he strode,
<A NAME="962"></A><BR>The tidings of the maiden's woeful end.
<A NAME="963"></A><BR>Soon as he heard it, like a tempest-blast
<A NAME="964"></A><BR>Down to the ridges of Ida leapt he: quaked
<A NAME="965"></A><BR>Under his feet the long glens and ravines
<A NAME="966"></A><BR>Deep-scored, all Ida's torrent-beds, and all
<A NAME="967"></A><BR>Far-stretching foot-hills.  Now had Ares brought
<A NAME="968"></A><BR>A day of mourning on the Myrmidons,
<A NAME="969"></A><BR>But Zeus himself from far Olympus sent
<A NAME="970"></A><BR>Mid shattering thunders terror of levin-bolts
<A NAME="971"></A><BR>Which thick and fast leapt through the welkin down
<A NAME="972"></A><BR>Before his feet, blazing with fearful flames.
<A NAME="973"></A><BR>And Ares saw, and knew the stormy threat
<A NAME="974"></A><BR>Of the mighty-thundering Father, and he stayed
<A NAME="975"></A><BR>His eager feet, now on the very brink
<A NAME="976"></A><BR>Of battle's turmoil.  As when some huge crag
<A NAME="977"></A><BR>Thrust from a beetling cliff-brow by the winds
<A NAME="978"></A><BR>And torrent rains, or lightning-lance of Zeus,
<A NAME="979"></A><BR>Leaps like a wild beast, and the mountain-glens
<A NAME="980"></A><BR>Fling back their crashing echoes as it rolls
<A NAME="981"></A><BR>In mad speed on, as with resistless swoop
<A NAME="982"></A><BR>Of bound on bound it rushes down, until
<A NAME="983"></A><BR>It cometh to the levels of the plain,
<A NAME="984"></A><BR>And there perforce its stormy flight is stayed;
<A NAME="985"></A><BR><BR>So Ares, battle-eager Son of Zeus,
<A NAME="986"></A><BR>Was stayed, how loth soe'er; for all the Gods
<A NAME="987"></A><BR>To the Ruler of the Blessed needs must yield,
<A NAME="988"></A><BR>Seeing he sits high-throned above them all,
<A NAME="989"></A><BR>Clothed in his might unspeakable.  Yet still
<A NAME="990"></A><BR>Many a wild thought surged through Ares' soul,
<A NAME="991"></A><BR>Urging him now to dread the terrible threat
<A NAME="992"></A><BR>Of Cronos' wrathful Son, and to return
<A NAME="993"></A><BR>Heavenward, and now to reck not of his Sire,
<A NAME="994"></A><BR>But with Achilles' blood to stain those hands,
<A NAME="995"></A><BR>The battle-tireless.  At the last his heart
<A NAME="996"></A><BR>Remembered how that many and many a son
<A NAME="997"></A><BR>Of Zeus himself in many a war had died,
<A NAME="998"></A><BR>Nor in their fall had Zeus availed them aught.
<A NAME="999"></A><BR>Therefore he turned him from the Argives -- else,
<A NAME="1000"></A><BR>Down smitten by the blasting thunderbolt,
<A NAME="1001"></A><BR>With Titans in the nether gloom he had lain,
<A NAME="1002"></A><BR>Who dared defy the eternal will of Zeus.
<A NAME="1003"></A><BR><BR>Then did the warrior sons of Argos strip
<A NAME="1004"></A><BR>With eager haste from corpses strown all round
<A NAME="1005"></A><BR>The blood-stained spoils.  But ever Peleus' son
<A NAME="1006"></A><BR>Gazed, wild with all regret, still gazed on her,
<A NAME="1007"></A><BR>The strong, the beautiful, laid in the dust;
<A NAME="1008"></A><BR>And all his heart was wrung, was broken down
<A NAME="1009"></A><BR>With sorrowing love, deep, strong as he had known
<A NAME="1010"></A><BR>When that beloved friend Patroclus died.
<A NAME="1011"></A><BR><BR>Loud jeered Thersites, mocking to his face:
<A NAME="1012"></A><BR>"Thou sorry-souled Achilles!  art not shamed
<A NAME="1013"></A><BR>To let some evil Power beguile thine heart
<A NAME="1014"></A><BR>To pity of a pitiful Amazon
<A NAME="1015"></A><BR>Whose furious spirit purposed naught but ill
<A NAME="1016"></A><BR>To us and ours?  Ha, woman-mad art thou,
<A NAME="1017"></A><BR>And thy soul lusts for this thing, as she were
<A NAME="1018"></A><BR>Some lady wise in household ways, with gifts
<A NAME="1019"></A><BR>And pure intent for honoured wedlock wooed!
<A NAME="1020"></A><BR>Good had it been had her spear reached thine heart,
<A NAME="1021"></A><BR>The heart that sighs for woman-creatures still!
<A NAME="1022"></A><BR>Thou carest not, unmanly-souled, not thou,
<A NAME="1023"></A><BR>For valour's glorious path, when once thine eye
<A NAME="1024"></A><BR>Lights on a woman!  Sorry wretch, where now
<A NAME="1025"></A><BR>Is all thy goodly prowess?  where thy wit?
<A NAME="1026"></A><BR>And where the might that should beseem a king
<A NAME="1027"></A><BR>All-stainless?  Dost not know what misery
<A NAME="1028"></A><BR>This self-same woman-madness wrought for Troy?
<A NAME="1029"></A><BR>Nothing there is to men more ruinous
<A NAME="1030"></A><BR>Than lust for woman's beauty; it maketh fools
<A NAME="1031"></A><BR>Of wise men.  But the toil of war attains
<A NAME="1032"></A><BR>Renown.  To him that is a hero indeed
<A NAME="1033"></A><BR>Glory of victory and the War-god's works
<A NAME="1034"></A><BR>Are sweet.  'Tis but the battle-blencher craves
<A NAME="1035"></A><BR>The beauty and the bed of such as she!"
<A NAME="1036"></A><BR><BR>So railed he long and loud: the mighty heart
<A NAME="1037"></A><BR>Of Peleus' son leapt into flame of wrath.
<A NAME="1038"></A><BR>A sudden buffet of his resistless hand
<A NAME="1039"></A><BR>Smote 'neath the railer's ear, and all his teeth
<A NAME="1040"></A><BR>Were dashed to the earth: he fell upon his face:
<A NAME="1041"></A><BR>Forth of his lips the blood in torrent gushed:
<A NAME="1042"></A><BR>Swift from his body fled the dastard soul
<A NAME="1043"></A><BR>Of that vile niddering.  Achaea's sons
<A NAME="1044"></A><BR>Rejoiced thereat, for aye he wont to rail
<A NAME="1045"></A><BR>On each and all with venomous gibes, himself
<A NAME="1046"></A><BR>A scandal and the shame of all the host.
<A NAME="1047"></A><BR>Then mid the warrior Argives cried a voice:
<A NAME="1048"></A><BR>"Not good it is for baser men to rail
<A NAME="1049"></A><BR>On kings, or secretly or openly;
<A NAME="1050"></A><BR>For wrathful retribution swiftly comes.
<A NAME="1051"></A><BR>The Lady of Justice sits on high; and she
<A NAME="1052"></A><BR>Who heapeth woe on woe on humankind,
<A NAME="1053"></A><BR>Even Ate, punisheth the shameless tongue."
<A NAME="1054"></A><BR><BR>So mid the Danaans cried a voice: nor yet
<A NAME="1055"></A><BR>Within the mighty soul of Peleus' son
<A NAME="1056"></A><BR>Lulled was the storm of wrath, but fiercely he spake:
<A NAME="1057"></A><BR>"Lie there in dust, thy follies all forgot!
<A NAME="1058"></A><BR>'Tis not for knaves to beard their betters: once
<A NAME="1059"></A><BR>Thou didst provoke Odysseus' steadfast soul,
<A NAME="1060"></A><BR>Babbling with venomous tongue a thousand gibes,
<A NAME="1061"></A><BR>And didst escape with life; but thou hast found
<A NAME="1062"></A><BR>The son of Peleus not so patient-souled,
<A NAME="1063"></A><BR>Who with one only buffet from his hand
<A NAME="1064"></A><BR>Unkennels thy dog's soul!  A bitter doom
<A NAME="1065"></A><BR>Hath swallowed thee: by thine own rascalry
<A NAME="1066"></A><BR>Thy life is sped.  Hence from Achaean men,
<A NAME="1067"></A><BR>And mouth out thy revilings midst the dead!"
<A NAME="1068"></A><BR><BR>So spake the valiant-hearted aweless son
<A NAME="1069"></A><BR>Of Aeacus.  But Tydeus' son alone
<A NAME="1070"></A><BR>Of all the Argives was with anger stirred
<A NAME="1071"></A><BR>Against Achilles for Thersites slain,
<A NAME="1072"></A><BR>Seeing these twain were of the self-same blood,
<A NAME="1073"></A><BR>The one, proud Tydeus' battle-eager son,
<A NAME="1074"></A><BR>The other, seed of godlike Agrius:
<A NAME="1075"></A><BR>Brother of noble Oeneus Agrius was;
<A NAME="1076"></A><BR>And Oeneus in the Danaan land begat
<A NAME="1077"></A><BR>Tydeus the battle-eager, son to whom
<A NAME="1078"></A><BR>Was stalwart Diomedes.  Therefore wroth
<A NAME="1079"></A><BR>Was he for slain Thersites, yea, had raised
<A NAME="1080"></A><BR>Against the son of Peleus vengeful hands,
<A NAME="1081"></A><BR>Exeept the noblest of Aehaea's sons
<A NAME="1082"></A><BR>Had thronged around him, and besought him sore,
<A NAME="1083"></A><BR>And held him back therefrom.  With Peleus' son
<A NAME="1084"></A><BR>Also they pleaded; else those mighty twain,
<A NAME="1085"></A><BR>The mightiest of all Argives, were at point
<A NAME="1086"></A><BR>To close with clash of swords, so stung were they
<A NAME="1087"></A><BR>With bitter wrath; yet hearkened they at last
<A NAME="1088"></A><BR>To prayers of comrades, and were reconciled.
<A NAME="1089"></A><BR><BR>Then of their pity did the Atreid kings --
<A NAME="1090"></A><BR>For these too at the imperial loveliness
<A NAME="1091"></A><BR>Of Penthesileia marvelled -- render up
<A NAME="1092"></A><BR>Her body to the men of Troy, to bear
<A NAME="1093"></A><BR>Unto the burg of Ilus far-renowned
<A NAME="1094"></A><BR>With all her armour.  For a herald came
<A NAME="1095"></A><BR>Asking this boon for Priam; for the king
<A NAME="1096"></A><BR>Longed with deep yearning of the heart to lay
<A NAME="1097"></A><BR>That battle-eager maiden, with her arms,
<A NAME="1098"></A><BR>And with her war-horse, in the great earth-mound
<A NAME="1099"></A><BR>Of old Laomedon.  And so he heaped
<A NAME="1100"></A><BR>A high broad pyre without the city wall:
<A NAME="1101"></A><BR>Upon the height thereof that warrior-queen
<A NAME="1102"></A><BR>They laid, and costly treasures did they heap
<A NAME="1103"></A><BR>Around her, all that well beseems to burn
<A NAME="1104"></A><BR>Around a mighty queen in battle slain.
<A NAME="1105"></A><BR>And so the Fire-god's swift-upleaping might,
<A NAME="1106"></A><BR>The ravening flame, consumed her.  All around
<A NAME="1107"></A><BR>The people stood on every hand, and quenched
<A NAME="1108"></A><BR>The pyre with odorous wine.  Then gathered they
<A NAME="1109"></A><BR>The bones, and poured sweet ointment over them,
<A NAME="1110"></A><BR>And laid them in a casket: over all
<A NAME="1111"></A><BR>Shed they the rich fat of a heifer, chief
<A NAME="1112"></A><BR>Among the herds that grazed on Ida's slope.
<A NAME="1113"></A><BR>And, as for a beloved daughter, rang
<A NAME="1114"></A><BR>All round the Trojan men's heart-stricken wail,
<A NAME="1115"></A><BR>As by the stately wall they buried her
<A NAME="1116"></A><BR>On an outstanding tower, beside the bones
<A NAME="1117"></A><BR>Of old Laomedon, a queen beside
<A NAME="1118"></A><BR>A king.  This honour for the War-god's sake
<A NAME="1119"></A><BR>They rendered, and for Penthesileia's own.
<A NAME="1120"></A><BR>And in the plain beside her buried they
<A NAME="1121"></A><BR>The Amazons, even all that followed her
<A NAME="1122"></A><BR>To battle, and by Argive spears were slain.
<A NAME="1123"></A><BR>For Atreus' sons begrudged not these the boon
<A NAME="1124"></A><BR>Of tear-besprinkled graves, but let their friends,
<A NAME="1125"></A><BR>The warrior Trojans, draw their corpses forth,
<A NAME="1126"></A><BR>Yea, and their own slain also, from amidst
<A NAME="1127"></A><BR>The swath of darts o'er that grim harvest-field.
<A NAME="1128"></A><BR>Wrath strikes not at the dead: pitied are foes
<A NAME="1129"></A><BR>When life has fled, and left them foes no more.
<A NAME="1130"></A><BR><BR>Far off across the plain the while uprose
<A NAME="1131"></A><BR>Smoke from the pyres whereon the Argives laid
<A NAME="1132"></A><BR>The many heroes overthrown and slain
<A NAME="1133"></A><BR>By Trojan hands what time the sword devoured;
<A NAME="1134"></A><BR>And multitudinous lamentation wailed
<A NAME="1135"></A><BR>Over the perished.  But above the rest
<A NAME="1136"></A><BR>Mourned they o'er brave Podarces, who in fight
<A NAME="1137"></A><BR>Was no less mighty than his hero-brother
<A NAME="1138"></A><BR>Protesilaus, he who long ago
<A NAME="1139"></A><BR>Fell, slain of Hector: so Podarces now,
<A NAME="1140"></A><BR>Struck down by Penthesileia's spear, hath cast
<A NAME="1141"></A><BR>Over all Argive hearts the pall of grief.
<A NAME="1142"></A><BR>Wherefore apart from him they laid in clay
<A NAME="1143"></A><BR>The common throng of slain; but over him
<A NAME="1144"></A><BR>Toiling they heaped an earth-mound far-descried
<A NAME="1145"></A><BR>In memory of a warrior aweless-souled.
<A NAME="1146"></A><BR>And in a several pit withal they thrust
<A NAME="1147"></A><BR>The niddering Thersites' wretched corse.
<A NAME="1148"></A><BR>Then to the ships, acclaiming Aeacus' son,
<A NAME="1149"></A><BR>Returned they all.  But when the radiant day
<A NAME="1150"></A><BR>Had plunged beneath the Ocean-stream, and night,
<A NAME="1151"></A><BR>The holy, overspread the face of earth,
<A NAME="1152"></A><BR>Then in the rich king Agamemnon's tent
<A NAME="1153"></A><BR>Feasted the might of Peleus' son, and there
<A NAME="1154"></A><BR>Sat at the feast those other mighty ones
<A NAME="1155"></A><BR>All through the dark, till rose the dawn divine.
