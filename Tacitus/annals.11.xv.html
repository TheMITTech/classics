<A NAME="10"></A>A.D. 62-65
<A NAME="11"></A><BR><BR>Meanwhile, the Parthian king, Vologeses, when he heard of Corbulo's 
<A NAME="12"></A>achievements and of a foreign prince, Tigranes, having been set over Armenia, 
<A NAME="13"></A>though he longed at the same time to avenge the majesty of the Arsacids, 
<A NAME="14"></A>which had been insulted by the expulsion of his brother Tiridates, was, 
<A NAME="15"></A>on the other hand, drawn to different thoughts as he reflected on the greatness 
<A NAME="16"></A>of Rome, and felt reverence for a hitherto unbroken treaty. Naturally irresolute, 
<A NAME="17"></A>he was now hampered by a revolt of the Hyrcanians, a powerful tribe, and 
<A NAME="18"></A>by several wars arising out of it. Suddenly, as he was wavering, fresh 
<A NAME="19"></A>and further tidings of disgrace goaded him to action. Tigranes, quitting 
<A NAME="20"></A>Armenia, had ravaged the Adiabeni, a people on its border, too extensively 
<A NAME="21"></A>and continuously for mere plundering raids. The chief men of the tribes 
<A NAME="22"></A>were indignant at having fallen into such contempt that they were victims 
<A NAME="23"></A>to the inroads, not indeed of a Roman general, but of a daring hostage, 
<A NAME="24"></A>who for so many years had been numbered among slaves. Their anger was inflamed 
<A NAME="25"></A>by Monobazus, who ruled the Adiabeni, and repeatedly asked what protection 
<A NAME="26"></A>he was to seek and from what quarter- "Already," he said, "Armenia has 
<A NAME="27"></A>been given up, and its borders are being wrested from us, and unless the 
<A NAME="28"></A>Parthians help us, we shall find that subjection to Rome is lighter for 
<A NAME="29"></A>those who surrender than for the conquered." Tiridates too, exile as he 
<A NAME="30"></A>was from his kingdom, by his silence or very moderate complaints made the 
<A NAME="31"></A>deeper impression. "It is not," he urged, "by weak inaction that great 
<A NAME="32"></A>empires are held together; there must be the struggle of brave men in arms; 
<A NAME="33"></A>might is right with those who are at the summit of power. And though it 
<A NAME="34"></A>is the glory of a private house to keep its own, it is the glory of a king 
<A NAME="35"></A>to fight for the possessions of others."
<A NAME="36"></A><BR><BR>Moved by these considerations Vologeses called a council, placed 
<A NAME="37"></A>Tiridates by his side, and began to speak as follows: "This man before 
<A NAME="38"></A>you, born from the same father as myself, having waived in my favour, on 
<A NAME="39"></A>the ground of age, the highest title of all, was established by me in the 
<A NAME="40"></A>possession of Armenia, which is accounted the third grade of power. As 
<A NAME="41"></A>for Media, Pacorus was already in possession of it. And I thought to myself 
<A NAME="42"></A>that I had duly arranged our family and home so as to guard against the 
<A NAME="43"></A>old feuds and rivalries of brothers. The Romans thwart me, and though they 
<A NAME="44"></A>have never with success to themselves disturbed the peace between us, they 
<A NAME="45"></A>are now again breaking it to their own destruction. I will not attempt 
<A NAME="46"></A>to deny one thing. It was by just dealing rather than by bloodshed, by 
<A NAME="47"></A>having a good cause rather than by arms, that I had wished to retain what 
<A NAME="48"></A>my ancestors had won. If I have sinned through irresolution, my valour 
<A NAME="49"></A>shall make amends for it. Assuredly your strength and renown are at their 
<A NAME="50"></A>height, and you have in addition the repute of obedience, which the greatest 
<A NAME="51"></A>of mortals must not despise, and which the gods highly 
<A NAME="52"></A>esteem."
<A NAME="53"></A><BR><BR>As he spoke, he encircled Tiridates' brow with a diadem, and to 
<A NAME="54"></A>Moneses, a noble, he entrusted a highly efficient body of cavalry, which 
<A NAME="55"></A>was the king's customary escort, giving him also some auxiliaries from 
<A NAME="56"></A>the Adiabeni, and orders that Tigranes was to be driven out of Armenia. 
<A NAME="57"></A>He would himself abandon his feud with the Hyrcanians, and raise his own 
<A NAME="58"></A>national force in all its warlike strength by way of menace to the Roman 
<A NAME="59"></A>provinces.
<A NAME="60"></A><BR><BR>When Corbulo had heard all this from messengers he could trust, 
<A NAME="61"></A>he sent two legions under Verulanus Severus and Vettius Bolanus to the 
<A NAME="62"></A>support of Tigranes, with secret instructions that they were to conduct 
<A NAME="63"></A>all their operations with deliberation rather than despatch, as he would 
<A NAME="64"></A>prefer to sustain rather than to make war. And indeed he had written to 
<A NAME="65"></A>the emperor that a general was wanted specially for the defence of Armenia, 
<A NAME="66"></A>and that Syria, threatened as it was by Vologeses, was in yet more imminent 
<A NAME="67"></A>peril. Meanwhile he posted his remaining legions on the bank of the Euphrates, 
<A NAME="68"></A>armed a hastily collected force of provincials, and occupied with troops 
<A NAME="69"></A>the enemy's approaches. And as the country was deficient in water, he established 
<A NAME="70"></A>forts to guard the wells, and concealed some of the streams with heaps 
<A NAME="71"></A>of sand.
<A NAME="72"></A><BR><BR>While Corbulo was thus preparing for the defence of Syria, Moneses 
<A NAME="73"></A>rapidly pushed on his forces to anticipate the rumour of his advance, but 
<A NAME="74"></A>he did not any the more find Tigranes unaware of or unprepared for his 
<A NAME="75"></A>movement. He had, in fact, occupied Tigranocerta, a city strong from the 
<A NAME="76"></A>multitude of its defenders and the vastness of its fortifications. In addition, 
<A NAME="77"></A>the river Nicephorius, the breadth of which is far from contemptible, circled 
<A NAME="78"></A>a portion of its walls, and a wide fosse was drawn where they distrusted 
<A NAME="79"></A>the protection of the stream. There were some soldiers too, and supplies 
<A NAME="80"></A>previously provided. In the conveyance of these a few men had hurried on 
<A NAME="81"></A>too eagerly, and, having been surprised by a sudden attack from the enemy, 
<A NAME="82"></A>had inspired their comrades with rage rather than fear. But the Parthian 
<A NAME="83"></A>has not the daring in close combat needed for a successful siege. His thin 
<A NAME="84"></A>showers of arrows do not alarm men within walls, and only disappoint himself. 
<A NAME="85"></A>The Adiabeni, when they began to advance their scaling ladders and engines, 
<A NAME="86"></A>were easily driven back, and then cut down by a sally of our 
<A NAME="87"></A>men.
<A NAME="88"></A><BR><BR>Corbulo, however, notwithstanding his successes thought he must 
<A NAME="89"></A>use his good fortune with moderation, and sent Vologeses a message of remonstrance 
<A NAME="90"></A>against the violence done to a Roman province, and the blockade of an allied 
<A NAME="91"></A>and friendly king and of Roman cohorts. "He had better give up the siege, 
<A NAME="92"></A>or he, Corbulo too would encamp in his territory, as on hostile ground." 
<A NAME="93"></A>Casperius, a centurion selected for this mission, had an interview with 
<A NAME="94"></A>the king at the town Nisibis, thirty-seven miles distant from Tigranocerta, 
<A NAME="95"></A>and with fearless spirit announced his message. With Vologeses it was an 
<A NAME="96"></A>old and deep conviction that he should shun the arms of Rome. Nor was the 
<A NAME="97"></A>present going smoothly with him. The seige was a failure; Tigranes was 
<A NAME="98"></A>safe with his troops and supplies; those who had undertaken the storming 
<A NAME="99"></A>of the place had been routed; legions had been sent into Armenia, and other 
<A NAME="100"></A>legions were ready to rush to the attack on behalf of Syria, while his 
<A NAME="101"></A>own cavalry was crippled by want of food. A host of locusts, suddenly appearing, 
<A NAME="102"></A>had devoured every blade of grass and every leaf. And so, hiding his fear 
<A NAME="103"></A>and presenting a more conciliatory attitude, he replied that he would send 
<A NAME="104"></A>envoys to the Roman emperor for the possession of Armenia and the conclusion 
<A NAME="105"></A>of a lasting peace. He ordered Moneses to leave Tigranocerta, while he 
<A NAME="106"></A>himself retired.
<A NAME="107"></A><BR><BR>Many spoke highly of these results, as due to the king's alarm 
<A NAME="108"></A>and the threats of Corbulo, and as splendid successes. Others explained 
<A NAME="109"></A>them as a secret understanding that with the cessation of war on both sides 
<A NAME="110"></A>and the departure of Vologeses, Tigranes also was to quit Armenia. "Why," 
<A NAME="111"></A>it was asked, "had the Roman army been withdrawn from Tigranocerta? Why 
<A NAME="112"></A>had they abandoned in peace what they had defended in war? Was it better 
<A NAME="113"></A>for them to have wintered on the confines of Cappadocia in hastily constructed 
<A NAME="114"></A>huts, than in the capital of a kingdom lately recovered? There had been, 
<A NAME="115"></A>in short, a suspension of arms, in order that Vologeses might fight some 
<A NAME="116"></A>other foe than Corbulo, and that Corbulo might not further risk the glory 
<A NAME="117"></A>he had earned in so many years. For, as I have related, he had asked for 
<A NAME="118"></A>a general exclusively for the defence of Armenia, and it was heard that 
<A NAME="119"></A>Caesennius Paetus was on his way. And indeed he had now arrived, and the 
<A NAME="120"></A>army was thus divided; the fourth and twelfth legions, with the fifth which 
<A NAME="121"></A>had lately been raised in Moesia and the auxiliaries from Pontus, Galatia 
<A NAME="122"></A>and Cappadocia, were under the command of Paetus, while the third, sixth, 
<A NAME="123"></A>and tenth legions and the old soldiery of Syria remained with Corbulo. 
<A NAME="124"></A>All else they were to share or divide between them according to circumstances. 
<A NAME="125"></A>But as Corbulo could not endure a rival, so Paetus, who would have been 
<A NAME="126"></A>sufficiently honoured by ranking second to him, disparaged the results 
<A NAME="127"></A>of the war, and said repeatedly that there had been no bloodshed or spoil, 
<A NAME="128"></A>that the sieges of cities were sieges only in name, and that he would soon 
<A NAME="129"></A>impose on the conquered tribute and laws and Roman administration, instead 
<A NAME="130"></A>of the empty shadow of a king.
<A NAME="131"></A><BR><BR>About the same time the envoys of Vologeses, who had been sent, 
<A NAME="132"></A>as I have related, to the emperor, returned without success, and the Parthians 
<A NAME="133"></A>made open war. Nor did Paetus decline the challenge, but with two legions, 
<A NAME="134"></A>the 4th and 12th, the first of which was then commanded by Funisulanus 
<A NAME="135"></A>Vettonianus and the second by Calavius Sabinus, entered Armenia, with unlucky 
<A NAME="136"></A>omen. In the passage of the Euphrates, which they crossed by a bridge, 
<A NAME="137"></A>a horse which carried the consul's official emblems, took fright without 
<A NAME="138"></A>any apparent cause and fled to the rear. A victim, too, standing by some 
<A NAME="139"></A>of the winter-tents, which were being fortified, broke its way through 
<A NAME="140"></A>them, when the work was but half finished, and got clear out of the entrenchments. 
<A NAME="141"></A>Then again the soldiers' javelins gleamed with light, a prodigy the more 
<A NAME="142"></A>significant because the Parthian foe fights with missiles.
<A NAME="143"></A><BR><BR>Paetus, however, despising omens, before he had yet thoroughly 
<A NAME="144"></A>fortified his winter-camp or provided for his corn supply, hurried his 
<A NAME="145"></A>army across Mount Taurus, for the recovery, as he gave out, of Tigranocerta 
<A NAME="146"></A>and the ravaging of the country which Corbulo had left untouched. Some 
<A NAME="147"></A>forts too were taken, and some glory as well as plunder had been secured, 
<A NAME="148"></A>if only he had enjoyed his glory modestly, and his plunder with vigilance. 
<A NAME="149"></A>While he was overrunning in tedious expeditions districts which could not 
<A NAME="150"></A>be held, the supplies which had been captured, were spoilt, and as winter 
<A NAME="151"></A>was now at hand, he led back his army and wrote a letter to the emperor, 
<A NAME="152"></A>as if the war was finished, in pompous language, but barren of 
<A NAME="153"></A>facts.
<A NAME="154"></A><BR><BR>Meanwhile Corbulo occupied the bank of the Euphrates, which he 
<A NAME="155"></A>had never neglected, with troops at closer intervals. That he might have 
<A NAME="156"></A>no hindrance in throwing a bridge over it from the enemy's cavalry, which 
<A NAME="157"></A>was already scouring the adjoining plains with a formidable display, he 
<A NAME="158"></A>launched on the river some vessels of remarkable size, linked together 
<A NAME="159"></A>by beams, with towers rising from their decks, and with catapults and balistas 
<A NAME="160"></A>he drove off the barbarians. The stones and spears penetrated their host 
<A NAME="161"></A>at a range beyond the reach of the opposing volleys of arrows. The bridge 
<A NAME="162"></A>was then completed, and the hills facing us were occupied by our auxiliary 
<A NAME="163"></A>infantry, then, by the entrenchments of the legions, with such rapidity 
<A NAME="164"></A>and such a display of force that the Parthians, giving up their preparations 
<A NAME="165"></A>for the invasion of Syria, concentrated all their hopes on 
<A NAME="166"></A>Armenia.
<A NAME="167"></A><BR><BR>Paetus, ignorant of the impending danger, was keeping the 5th legion 
<A NAME="168"></A>at a distance in Pontus; the rest he had weakened by indiscriminate furloughs, 
<A NAME="169"></A>till it was heard that Vologeses was approaching with a powerful force 
<A NAME="170"></A>bent on war. He summoned the 12th legion, and then was discovered the numerical 
<A NAME="171"></A>feebleness of the source from which he had hoped for the repute of an augmented 
<A NAME="172"></A>army. Yet even thus the camp might have been held, and the Parthian foe 
<A NAME="173"></A>baffled, by protracting the war, had Paetus stood firm either by his own 
<A NAME="174"></A>counsels or by those of others. But though military men had put him on 
<A NAME="175"></A>his guard against imminent disasters, still, not wishing to seem to need 
<A NAME="176"></A>the advice of others, he would fall back on some quite different and inferior 
<A NAME="177"></A>plan. So now, leaving his winter quarters, and exclaiming that not the 
<A NAME="178"></A>fosse or the rampart, but the men's bodies and weapons were given him for 
<A NAME="179"></A>facing the foe, he led out his legions, as if he meant to fight a battle. 
<A NAME="180"></A>Then, after losing a centurion and a few soldiers whom he had sent on in 
<A NAME="181"></A>advance to reconnoitre the enemy's forces, he returned in alarm. And, as 
<A NAME="182"></A>Vologeses had not pressed his advantage with much vigour, Paetus once again, 
<A NAME="183"></A>with vain confidence, posted 3000 chosen infantry on the adjacent ridge 
<A NAME="184"></A>of the taurus, in order to bar the king's passage. He also stationed some 
<A NAME="185"></A>Pannonian troopers, the flower of his cavalry, in a part of the plain. 
<A NAME="186"></A>His wife and son he removed to a fortress named Arsamosata, with a cohort 
<A NAME="187"></A>for their defence, thus dispersing the troops which, if kept together, 
<A NAME="188"></A>could easily have checked the desultory skirmishing of the enemy. He could, 
<A NAME="189"></A>it is said, scarcely be driven to confess to Corbulo how the enemy was 
<A NAME="190"></A>pressing him. Corbulo made no haste, that, when the dangers thickened, 
<A NAME="191"></A>the glory of the rescue might be enhanced. Yet he ordered 1000 men from 
<A NAME="192"></A>each of his three legions with 800 cavalry, and an equal number of infantry 
<A NAME="193"></A>to be in instant readiness.
<A NAME="194"></A><BR><BR>Vologeses meanwhile, though he had heard that the roads were blocked 
<A NAME="195"></A>by Paetus, here with infantry, there with cavalry, did not alter his plan, 
<A NAME="196"></A>but drove off the latter by the menace of an attack, and crushed the legionaires, 
<A NAME="197"></A>only one centurion of whom, Tarquitius Crescens, dared to defend a tower 
<A NAME="198"></A>in which he was keeping guard. He had often sallied out, and cut to pieces 
<A NAME="199"></A>such of the barbarians as came close up to the walls, till he was overwhelmed 
<A NAME="200"></A>with volleys of firebrands. Every foot soldier still unwounded fled to 
<A NAME="201"></A>remote wilds, and those who were disabled, returned to the camp, exaggerating 
<A NAME="202"></A>in their terror the king's valour, and the warlike strength of his tribes, 
<A NAME="203"></A>everything in short, to the simple credulity of those who trembled with 
<A NAME="204"></A>like fear. Even the general did not struggle against his reverses. He had 
<A NAME="205"></A>indeed wholly abandoned all the duties of a soldier, and had again sent 
<A NAME="206"></A>an entreaty to Corbulo, that he would come with speed to save the standards 
<A NAME="207"></A>and eagles, and the name yet left to the unfortunate army; they meantime, 
<A NAME="208"></A>he said, would hold to their fidelity while life lasted.
<A NAME="209"></A><BR><BR>Corbulo, perfectly fearless, left half his army in Syria to retain 
<A NAME="210"></A>the forts built on the Euphrates, and taking the nearest route, which also 
<A NAME="211"></A>was not deficient in supplies, marched through the country of Commagene, 
<A NAME="212"></A>then through Cappadocia, and thence into Armenia. Beside the other usual 
<A NAME="213"></A>accompaniments of war, his army was followed by a great number of camels 
<A NAME="214"></A>laden with corn, to keep off famine as well as the enemy. The first he 
<A NAME="215"></A>met of the defeated army was Paccius, a first-rank centurion, then many 
<A NAME="216"></A>of the soldiers, whom, when they pleaded various excuses for flight, he 
<A NAME="217"></A>advised to return to their standards and throw themselves on the mercy 
<A NAME="218"></A>of Paetus. "For himself," he said, "he had no forgiveness but for the 
<A NAME="219"></A>victorious."
<A NAME="220"></A><BR><BR>As he spoke, he went up to his legions, cheering them and reminding 
<A NAME="221"></A>them of their past career, and pointing the way to new glory. "It was not 
<A NAME="222"></A>to villages or towns of Armenia, but to a Roman camp with two legions, 
<A NAME="223"></A>a worthy recompense for their efforts, that they were bound. If each common 
<A NAME="224"></A>soldier were to have bestowed on him by the emperor's hand the special 
<A NAME="225"></A>honour of a crown for a rescued citizen, how wonderfully great the glory, 
<A NAME="226"></A>when the numbers would be equal of those who had brought and of those had 
<A NAME="227"></A>received deliverance." Roused by these and like words into a common enthusiasm, 
<A NAME="228"></A>and some too were filled with an ardour peculiarly their own by the perils 
<A NAME="229"></A>of brothers and kinsfolk, they hurried on by day and night their uninterrupted 
<A NAME="230"></A>march.
<A NAME="231"></A><BR><BR>All the more vigorously did Vologeses press the besieged, now attacking 
<A NAME="232"></A>the legions' entrenchments, and now again the fortress, which guarded those 
<A NAME="233"></A>whose years unfitted them for war. He advanced closer than is the Parthian 
<A NAME="234"></A>practice, seeking to lure the enemy to an engagement by such rashness. 
<A NAME="235"></A>They, however, could hardly be dragged out of their tents, and would merely 
<A NAME="236"></A>defend their lives, some held back by the general's order, others by their 
<A NAME="237"></A>own cowardice; they seemed to be awaiting Corbulo, and should they be overpowered 
<A NAME="238"></A>by force, they had before them the examples of Candium and Numantia. "Neither 
<A NAME="239"></A>the Samnites, Italian people as they were, nor the Carthaginians, the rivals 
<A NAME="240"></A>of the Roman empire, were, it seemed, equally formidable, and even the 
<A NAME="241"></A>men of old, with all their strength and glory, whenever fortune was adverse, 
<A NAME="242"></A>had taken thought for safety."
<A NAME="243"></A><BR><BR>The general, although he was overcome by the despair of his army, 
<A NAME="244"></A>first wrote a letter to Vologeses, not a suppliant petition, but in a tone 
<A NAME="245"></A>of remonstrance against the doing of hostile acts on behalf of the Armenians, 
<A NAME="246"></A>who always had been under Roman dominion, or subject to a king chosen by 
<A NAME="247"></A>the emperor. Peace, he reminded him, was equally for the interest of both, 
<A NAME="248"></A>and it would be well for him not to look only at the present. He indeed 
<A NAME="249"></A>had advanced with the whole strength of his kingdom against two legions, 
<A NAME="250"></A>while the Romans had all the rest of the world with which to sustain the 
<A NAME="251"></A>war.
<A NAME="252"></A><BR><BR>To this Vologeses replied nothing to the purpose, but merely that 
<A NAME="253"></A>he must wait for his brothers Pacorus and Tiridates, that the place and 
<A NAME="254"></A>time of their meeting had been fixed on as the occasion when they would 
<A NAME="255"></A>decide about Armenia, and that heaven had granted them a further honour, 
<A NAME="256"></A>well worthy of the Arsacids, the having to determine the fate of Roman 
<A NAME="257"></A>legions. Messengers were then despatched by Paetus and an interview requested 
<A NAME="258"></A>with the king, who ordered Vasaces, the commander of the cavalry, to go. 
<A NAME="259"></A>Thereupon Paetus dwelt on the memories of the Luculli and Pompeii, and 
<A NAME="260"></A>of all that the Caesars had done in the way of holding or giving away Armenia, 
<A NAME="261"></A>while Vasaces declared that we had the mere shadow of possession and of 
<A NAME="262"></A>bestowing, but the Parthians, the reality of power. After much arguing 
<A NAME="263"></A>on both sides, Monobazus of the Adiabeni was called the next day to be 
<A NAME="264"></A>a witness to the stipulations into which they had entered. It was agreed 
<A NAME="265"></A>that the legions should be released from the blockade, that all the troops 
<A NAME="266"></A>should quit Armenian territory, and that the forts and supplies should 
<A NAME="267"></A>be surrendered to the Parthians, and when all this had been completed, 
<A NAME="268"></A>Vologeses was to have full permission to send envoys to 
<A NAME="269"></A>Nero.
<A NAME="270"></A><BR><BR>Meanwhile Paetus threw a bridge over the river Arsanias, which 
<A NAME="271"></A>flowed by the camp, apparently with the view of facilitating his march. 
<A NAME="272"></A>It was the Parthians, however, who had required this, as an evidence of 
<A NAME="273"></A>their victory; for the bridge was of use to them, while our men went a 
<A NAME="274"></A>different way. Rumour added that the legions had been passed under the 
<A NAME="275"></A>yoke, with other miserable disgraces, of which the Armenians had borrowed 
<A NAME="276"></A>imitations. For they not only entered our lines before the Roman army began 
<A NAME="277"></A>to retire, but also stood about the camp streets, recognizing and dragging 
<A NAME="278"></A>off slaves or beasts of burden which we had previously captured. They even 
<A NAME="279"></A>seized clothes and detained weapons, for the soldiers were utterly cowed 
<A NAME="280"></A>and gave up everything, so that no cause for fighting might arise. Vologeses 
<A NAME="281"></A>having piled up the arms and bodies of the slain in order to attest our 
<A NAME="282"></A>defeat, refrained from gazing on the fugitive legions. He sought a character 
<A NAME="283"></A>for moderation after he had glutted his pride. Seated himself on an elephant, 
<A NAME="284"></A>he crossed the river Arsanias, while those next to his person rushed through 
<A NAME="285"></A>it at the utmost speed of their horses; for a rumour had gained ground 
<A NAME="286"></A>that the bridge would give way, through the trickery of its builders. But 
<A NAME="287"></A>those who ventured to go on it found it to be firm and 
<A NAME="288"></A>trustworthy.
<A NAME="289"></A><BR><BR>As for the besieged, it appeared that they had such an abundance 
<A NAME="290"></A>of corn that they fired the granaries, and Corbulo declared that the Parthians 
<A NAME="291"></A>on the other hand were in want of supplies, and would have abandoned the 
<A NAME="292"></A>siege from their fodder being all but exhausted, and that he was himself 
<A NAME="293"></A>only three days' march distant. He further stated that Paetus had guaranteed 
<A NAME="294"></A>by an oath, before the standards, in the presence of those whom the king 
<A NAME="295"></A>had sent to be witnesses, that no Roman was to enter Armenia until Nero's 
<A NAME="296"></A>reply arrived as to whether he assented to the peace. Though this may have 
<A NAME="297"></A>been invented to enhance our disgrace, yet about the rest of the story 
<A NAME="298"></A>there is no obscurity, that, in a single day Paetus traversed forty miles, 
<A NAME="299"></A>leaving his wounded behind him everywhere, and that the consternation of 
<A NAME="300"></A>the fugitives was as frightful as if they had turned their backs in battle. 
<A NAME="301"></A>Corbulo, as he met them with his forces on the bank of the Euphrates, did 
<A NAME="302"></A>not make such a display of his standards and arms as to shame them by the 
<A NAME="303"></A>contrast. His men, in their grief and pity for the lot of their comrades, 
<A NAME="304"></A>could not even refrain from tears. There was scarce any mutual salutation 
<A NAME="305"></A>for weeping. The spirit of a noble rivalry and the desire of glory, emotions 
<A NAME="306"></A>which stir men in success, had died away; pity alone survived, the more 
<A NAME="307"></A>strongly in the inferior ranks.
<A NAME="308"></A><BR><BR>Then followed a short conversation between the generals. While 
<A NAME="309"></A>Corbulo complained that his efforts had been fruitless and that the war 
<A NAME="310"></A>might have been ended with the flight of the Parthians, Paetus replied 
<A NAME="311"></A>that for neither of them was anything lost, and urged that they should 
<A NAME="312"></A>reverse the eagles, and with their united forces invade Armenia, much weakened, 
<A NAME="313"></A>as it was, by the departure of Vologeses. Corbulo said that he had no such 
<A NAME="314"></A>instructions from the emperor; it was the peril of the legions which had 
<A NAME="315"></A>stirred him to leave his province, and, as there was uncertainty about 
<A NAME="316"></A>the designs of the Parthians, he should return to Syria, and, even as it 
<A NAME="317"></A>was, he must pray for fortune under her most favourable aspect in order 
<A NAME="318"></A>that the infantry, wearied out with long marches, might keep pace with 
<A NAME="319"></A>the enemy's untiring cavalry, certain to outstrip him on the plains, which 
<A NAME="320"></A>facilitated their movements. Paetus then went into winter quarters in Cappadocia. 
<A NAME="321"></A>Vologeses, however, sent a message to Corbulo, requiring him to remove 
<A NAME="322"></A>the fortresses on the further bank of the Euphrates, and to leave the river 
<A NAME="323"></A>to be, as formerly, the boundary between them. Corbulo also demanded the 
<A NAME="324"></A>evacuation of Armenia by the garrisons posted throughout it. At last the 
<A NAME="325"></A>king yielded, all the positions fortified by Corbulo beyond the Euphrates 
<A NAME="326"></A>were destroyed, and the Armenians too left without a 
<A NAME="327"></A>master.
<A NAME="328"></A><BR><BR>At Rome meanwhile trophies for the Parthian war, and arches were 
<A NAME="329"></A>erected in the centre of the Capitoline hill; these had been decreed by 
<A NAME="330"></A>the Senate, while the war was yet undecided, and even now they were not 
<A NAME="331"></A>given up, appearances being consulted, in disregard of known facts. And 
<A NAME="332"></A>to hide his anxious fears about foreign affairs, Nero threw the people's 
<A NAME="333"></A>corn, which was so old as to be spoilt, into the Tiber, with the view of 
<A NAME="334"></A>keeping up a sense of security about the supplies. There was no addition 
<A NAME="335"></A>to the price, although about two hundred ships were destroyed in the very 
<A NAME="336"></A>harbour by a violent storm, and one hundred more, which had sailed up the 
<A NAME="337"></A>Tiber, by an accidental fire. Nero next appointed three ex-consuls, Lucius 
<A NAME="338"></A>Piso, Ducennius Geminus, and Pompeius Paulinus, to the management of the 
<A NAME="339"></A>public revenues, and inveighed at the same time against former emperors 
<A NAME="340"></A>whose heavy expenditure had exceeded their legitimate income. He himself, 
<A NAME="341"></A>he said, made the state an annual present of sixty million 
<A NAME="342"></A>sesterces.
<A NAME="343"></A><BR><BR>A very demoralizing custom had at this time become rife, of fictitious 
<A NAME="344"></A>adoptions of children, on the eve of the elections or of the assignment 
<A NAME="345"></A>of the provinces, by a number of childless persons, who, after obtaining 
<A NAME="346"></A>along with real fathers praetorships and provinces, forthwith dismissed 
<A NAME="347"></A>from paternal control the sons whom they had adopted. An appeal was made 
<A NAME="348"></A>to the Senate under a keen sense of wrong. Parents pleaded natural rights 
<A NAME="349"></A>and the anxieties of nurture against fraudulent evasions and the brief 
<A NAME="350"></A>ceremony of adoption. "It was," they argued, "sufficient reward for the 
<A NAME="351"></A>childless to have influence and distinction, everything, in short, easy 
<A NAME="352"></A>and open to them, without a care and without a burden. For themselves, 
<A NAME="353"></A>they found that the promises held out by the laws, for which they had long 
<A NAME="354"></A>waited, were turned into mockery, when one who knew nothing of a parent's 
<A NAME="355"></A>solicitude or of the sorrows of bereavement could rise in a moment to the 
<A NAME="356"></A>level of a father's long deferred hopes."
<A NAME="357"></A><BR><BR>On this, a decree of the Senate was passed that a fictitious adoption 
<A NAME="358"></A>should be of no avail in any department of the public service, or even 
<A NAME="359"></A>hold good for acquiring an inheritance.
<A NAME="360"></A><BR><BR>Next came the prosecution of Claudius Timarchus of Crete, on such 
<A NAME="361"></A>charges as often fall on very influential provincials, whom immense wealth 
<A NAME="362"></A>has emboldened to the oppression of the weak. But one speech of his had 
<A NAME="363"></A>gone to the extremity of a gross insult to the Senate; for he had repeatedly 
<A NAME="364"></A>declared that it was in his power to decide whether the proconsuls who 
<A NAME="365"></A>had governed Crete should receive the thanks of the province. Paetus Thrasea, 
<A NAME="366"></A>turning the occasion to public advantage, after having stated his opinion 
<A NAME="367"></A>that the accused ought to be expelled from Crete, further spoke as 
<A NAME="368"></A>follows:-
<A NAME="369"></A><BR><BR>"It is found by experience, Senators, that admirable laws and right 
<A NAME="370"></A>precedents among the good have their origin in the misdeeds of others. 
<A NAME="371"></A>Thus the license of advocates resulted in the Cincian bill; the corrupt 
<A NAME="372"></A>practices of candidates, in the Julian laws; the rapacity of magistrates, 
<A NAME="373"></A>in the Calpurnian enactments. For, in point of time, guilt comes before 
<A NAME="374"></A>punishment, and correction follows after delinquency. And therefore, to 
<A NAME="375"></A>meet the new insolence of provincials, let us adopt a measure worthy of 
<A NAME="376"></A>Roman good faith and resolution, whereby our allies may lose nothing of 
<A NAME="377"></A>our protection, while public opinion may cease to say of us, that the estimate 
<A NAME="378"></A>of a man's character is to found anywhere rather than in the judgment of 
<A NAME="379"></A>our citizens.
<A NAME="380"></A><BR><BR>"Formerly, it was not only a praetor or a consul, but private persons 
<A NAME="381"></A>also, who were sent to inspect the provinces, and to report what they thought 
<A NAME="382"></A>about each man's loyalty. And nations were timidly sensitive to the opinion 
<A NAME="383"></A>of individuals. But now we court foreigners and flatter them, and just 
<A NAME="384"></A>as there is a vote of thanks at any one's pleasure, so even more eagerly 
<A NAME="385"></A>is a prosecution decided on. Well; let it be decided on, and let the provincials 
<A NAME="386"></A>retain the right of showing their power in this fashion, but as for false 
<A NAME="387"></A>praise which has been extorted by entreaties, let it be as much checked 
<A NAME="388"></A>as fraud or tyranny. More faults are often committed, while we are trying 
<A NAME="389"></A>to oblige than while we are giving offence. Nay, some virtues are actually 
<A NAME="390"></A>hated; inflexible strictness, for example, and a temper proof against partiality. 
<A NAME="391"></A>Consequently, our magistrates' early career is generally better than its 
<A NAME="392"></A>close, which deteriorates, when we are anxiously seeking votes, like candidates. 
<A NAME="393"></A>If such practices are stopped, our provinces will be ruled more equitably 
<A NAME="394"></A>and more steadily. For as the dread of a charge of extortion has been a 
<A NAME="395"></A>check to rapacity, so, by prohibiting the vote of thanks, will the pursuit 
<A NAME="396"></A>of popularity be restrained."
<A NAME="397"></A><BR><BR>This opinion was hailed with great unanimity, but the Senate's 
<A NAME="398"></A>resolution could not be finally passed, as the consuls decided that there 
<A NAME="399"></A>had been no formal motion on the subject. Then, at the emperor's suggestion, 
<A NAME="400"></A>they decreed that no one was to propose to any council of our allies that 
<A NAME="401"></A>a vote of thanks ought to be given in the Senate to propraetors or proconsuls, 
<A NAME="402"></A>and that no one was to discharge such a mission.
<A NAME="403"></A><BR><BR>During the same consulship a gymnasium was wholly consumed by a 
<A NAME="404"></A>stroke of lightning, and a statue of Nero within it was melted down to 
<A NAME="405"></A>a shapeless mass of bronze. An earthquake too demolished a large part of 
<A NAME="406"></A>Pompeii, a populous town in Campania. And one of the vestal virgins, Laelia, 
<A NAME="407"></A>died, and in her place was chosen Cornelia, of the family of the 
<A NAME="408"></A>Cossi.
<A NAME="409"></A><BR><BR>During the consulship of Memmius Regulus and Verginius Rufus, Nero 
<A NAME="410"></A>welcomed with something more than mortal joy the birth of a daughter by 
<A NAME="411"></A>Poppaea, whom he called Augusta, the same title having also been given 
<A NAME="412"></A>to Poppaea. The place of her confinement was the colony of Antium, where 
<A NAME="413"></A>the emperor himself was born. Already had the Senate commended Poppaea's 
<A NAME="414"></A>safety to the gods, and had made vows in the State's name, which were repeated 
<A NAME="415"></A>again and again and duly discharged. To these was added a public thanksgiving, 
<A NAME="416"></A>and a temple was decreed to the goddess of fecundity, as well as games 
<A NAME="417"></A>and contests after the type of the ceremonies commemorative of Actium, 
<A NAME="418"></A>and golden images of the two Fortunes were to be set up on the throne of 
<A NAME="419"></A>Jupiter of the Capitol. Shows too of the circus were to be exhibited in 
<A NAME="420"></A>honour of the Claudian and Domitian families at Antium, like those at Bovillae 
<A NAME="421"></A>in commemoration of the Julii. Transient distinctions all of them, as within 
<A NAME="422"></A>four months the infant died. Again there was an outburst of flattery, men 
<A NAME="423"></A>voting the honours of deification, of a shrine, a temple, and a 
<A NAME="424"></A>priest.
<A NAME="425"></A><BR><BR>The emperor, too, was as excessive in his grief as he had been 
<A NAME="426"></A>in his joy. It was observed that when all the Senate rushed out to Antium 
<A NAME="427"></A>to honour the recent birth, Thrasea was forbidden to go, and received with 
<A NAME="428"></A>fearless spirit an affront which foreboded his doom. Then followed, as 
<A NAME="429"></A>rumour says, an expression from the emperor, in which he boasted to Seneca 
<A NAME="430"></A>of his reconciliation with Thrasea, on which Seneca congratulated him. 
<A NAME="431"></A>And now henceforth the glory and the peril of these illustrious men grew 
<A NAME="432"></A>greater.
<A NAME="433"></A><BR><BR>Meanwhile, in the beginning of spring, Parthian envoys brought 
<A NAME="434"></A>a message from king Vologeses, with a letter to the same effect. "He did 
<A NAME="435"></A>not," it was said, "repeat his former and frequent claims to the holding 
<A NAME="436"></A>of Armenia, since the gods who ruled the destinies of the most powerful 
<A NAME="437"></A>nations, had handed over its possession to the Parthians, not without disgrace 
<A NAME="438"></A>to Rome. Only lately, he had besieged Tigranes; afterwards, he let Paetus 
<A NAME="439"></A>and his legions depart in safety when he could have destroyed them. He 
<A NAME="440"></A>had tried force with a satisfactory result; he had also given clemency 
<A NAME="441"></A>a trial. Nor would Tiridates refuse a journey to Rome to receive the crown, 
<A NAME="442"></A>were he not detained at home by the duties of a sacred office. He was ready 
<A NAME="443"></A>to go to the emperor's image in the Roman headquarters, and there in the 
<A NAME="444"></A>presence of the legions inaugurate his reign."
<A NAME="445"></A><BR><BR>As Paetus's despatch contradicted this letter from Vologeses and 
<A NAME="446"></A>implied that matters were unchanged, the centurion who had arrived with 
<A NAME="447"></A>the envoys was questioned as to the state of Armenia. He replied that all 
<A NAME="448"></A>the Romans had quitted it. Then was perceived the mockery of the barbarians 
<A NAME="449"></A>in petitioning for what they had wrested from us, and Nero consulted with 
<A NAME="450"></A>the chief men of the State whether they should accept a dangerous war or 
<A NAME="451"></A>a disgraceful peace. There was no hesitation about war. Corbulo, who had 
<A NAME="452"></A>known our soldiers and the enemy for so many years, was appointed to conduct 
<A NAME="453"></A>it, that there might be no more blunders through any other officer's incapacity; 
<A NAME="454"></A>for people were utterly disgusted with Paetus.
<A NAME="455"></A><BR><BR>So the envoys were sent back without an answer, but with some presents, 
<A NAME="456"></A>in order to inspire a hope that Tiridates would not make the same request 
<A NAME="457"></A>in vain, if only he presented his petition in person. The administration 
<A NAME="458"></A>of Syria was intrusted to Caius Itius, and the military forces to Corbulo, 
<A NAME="459"></A>to which was added the fifteenth legion, under the leadership of Marius 
<A NAME="460"></A>Celsus, from Pannonia. Written orders were sent to the tetrarchs, the tributaries, 
<A NAME="461"></A>kings, prefects and procurators, and all the praetors who governed the 
<A NAME="462"></A>neighbouring provinces, to obey Corbulo's commands, as his powers were 
<A NAME="463"></A>enlarged on much the same scale as that which the Roman people had granted 
<A NAME="464"></A>to Cneius Pompeius on the eve of his war against the Pirates. When Paetus 
<A NAME="465"></A>returned and dreaded something worse, the emperor thought it enough to 
<A NAME="466"></A>reproach him with a jest, to the effect that he pardoned him at once, lest 
<A NAME="467"></A>one so ready to take fright might sink under prolonged 
<A NAME="468"></A>suspense.
<A NAME="469"></A><BR><BR>Corbulo meantime transferred to Syria the fourth and twelfth legions, 
<A NAME="470"></A>which, from the loss of their bravest men and the panic of the remainder, 
<A NAME="471"></A>seemed quite unfit for battle, and led thence into Armenia the third and 
<A NAME="472"></A>sixth legions, troops in thorough efficiency, and trained by frequent and 
<A NAME="473"></A>successful service. And he added to his army the fifth legion, which, having 
<A NAME="474"></A>been quartered in Pontus, had known nothing of disaster, with men of the 
<A NAME="475"></A>fifteenth, lately brought up, and picked veterans from Illyricum and Egypt, 
<A NAME="476"></A>and all the allied cavalry and infantry, and the auxiliaries of the tributary 
<A NAME="477"></A>princes, which had been concentrated at Melitene, where he was preparing 
<A NAME="478"></A>to cross the Euphrates. Then, after the due lustration of his army, he 
<A NAME="479"></A>called them together for an harangue, and began with grand allusions to 
<A NAME="480"></A>the imperial auspices, and to his own achievements, while he attributed 
<A NAME="481"></A>their disasters to the incapacity of Paetus. He spoke with much impressiveness, 
<A NAME="482"></A>which in him, as a military man, was as good as eloquence.
<A NAME="483"></A><BR><BR>He then pursued the route opened up in former days by Lucius Lucullus, 
<A NAME="484"></A>clearing away the obstructions of long years. Envoys who came to him from 
<A NAME="485"></A>Tiridates and Vologeses about peace, he did not repulse, but sent back 
<A NAME="486"></A>with them some centurions with a message anything but harsh. "Matters," 
<A NAME="487"></A>he said, "have not yet gone so far as to require the extremity of war. 
<A NAME="488"></A>Many successes have fallen to the lot of Rome, some to that of Parthia, 
<A NAME="489"></A>as a warning against pride. Therefore, it is to the advantage of Tiridates 
<A NAME="490"></A>to accept as a gift a kingdom yet unhurt by the ravages of war, and Vologeses 
<A NAME="491"></A>will better consult the welfare of the Parthian people by an alliance with 
<A NAME="492"></A>Rome than by mutual injuries. I know how much there is of internal discord, 
<A NAME="493"></A>and over what untamably fierce tribes he reigns. My emperor, on the other 
<A NAME="494"></A>hand, has undisturbed peace all around him, and this is his only 
<A NAME="495"></A>war."
<A NAME="496"></A><BR><BR>In an instant Corbulo backed up his advice by a menacing attitude. 
<A NAME="497"></A>He drove from their possessions the nobles of Armenia, who had been the 
<A NAME="498"></A>first to revolt from us, destroyed their fortresses, and spread equal panic 
<A NAME="499"></A>throughout the plain and the hill country, among the strong and among the 
<A NAME="500"></A>weak.
<A NAME="501"></A><BR><BR>Against the name of Corbulo no rage, nothing of the hatred of an 
<A NAME="502"></A>enemy, was felt by the barbarians, and they therefore thought his advice 
<A NAME="503"></A>trustworthy. Consequently Vologeses was not implacable to the uttermost, 
<A NAME="504"></A>and he even asked a truce for some divisions of his kingdom. Tiridates 
<A NAME="505"></A>demanded a place and a day for an interview. The time was to be soon, the 
<A NAME="506"></A>place that in which Paetus and his legions had been lately besieged, for 
<A NAME="507"></A>this was chosen by the barbarians in remembrance for their more prosperous 
<A NAME="508"></A>fortune. Corbulo did not refuse, resolved that a widely different issue 
<A NAME="509"></A>should enhance his renown. Nor did the disgrace of Paetus trouble him, 
<A NAME="510"></A>as was clearly proved by the fact that he commanded Paetus' son, who was 
<A NAME="511"></A>a tribune, to take some companies with him and cover up the relics of that 
<A NAME="512"></A>ill-starred battle-field. On the day appointed, Tiberius Alexander, a distinguished 
<A NAME="513"></A>Roman knight, sent to assist in the campaign, and Vinianus Annius, Corbulo's 
<A NAME="514"></A>son-in-law, who, though not yet of a senator's age, had the command of 
<A NAME="515"></A>the fifth legion as "legatus," entered the camp of Tiridates, by way of 
<A NAME="516"></A>compliment to him, and to reassure him against treachery by so valuable 
<A NAME="517"></A>a pledge. Each then took with him twenty horsemen. The king, seeing Corbulo, 
<A NAME="518"></A>was the first to dismount, and Corbulo hesitated not a moment, but both 
<A NAME="519"></A>on foot joined their right hands.
<A NAME="520"></A><BR><BR>Then the Roman commended the young prince for abandoning rash courses, 
<A NAME="521"></A>and adopting a safe and expedient policy. Tiridates first dwelt much on 
<A NAME="522"></A>the nobility of his race, but went on to speak in a tone of moderation. 
<A NAME="523"></A>He would go to Rome, and bring the emperor a new glory, a suppliant Arsacid, 
<A NAME="524"></A>while Parthia was prosperous. It was then agreed that Tiridates should 
<A NAME="525"></A>lay down his royal crown before Caesar's image, and resume it only from 
<A NAME="526"></A>the hand of Nero. The interview then ended with a kiss. After an interval 
<A NAME="527"></A>of a few days there was a grand display on both sides; on the one, cavalry 
<A NAME="528"></A>ranged in squadrons with their national ensigns; on the other, stood the 
<A NAME="529"></A>columns of our legions with glittering eagles and standards and images 
<A NAME="530"></A>of deities, after the appearance of a temple. In the midst, on a tribunal, 
<A NAME="531"></A>was a chair of state, and on the chair a statue of Nero. To this Tiridates 
<A NAME="532"></A>advanced, and having slain the customary victims, he removed the crown 
<A NAME="533"></A>from his head, and set it at the foot of the statue; whereupon all felt 
<A NAME="534"></A>a deep thrill of emotion, rendered the more intense by the sight which 
<A NAME="535"></A>yet lingered before their eyes, of the slaughter or siege of Roman armies. 
<A NAME="536"></A>"But now," they thought, "the calamity is reversed; Tiridates is about 
<A NAME="537"></A>to go, a spectacle to the world, little better than a 
<A NAME="538"></A>prisoner."
<A NAME="539"></A><BR><BR>To military glory Corbulo added courtesy and hospitality. When 
<A NAME="540"></A>the king continually asked the reason of whatever he noticed which was 
<A NAME="541"></A>new to him, the announcements, for example, by a centurion of the beginnings 
<A NAME="542"></A>of each watch, the dismissal of the guests by the sound of a trumpet, and 
<A NAME="543"></A>the lighting by a torch from beneath of an altar in front of the headquarters, 
<A NAME="544"></A>Corbulo, by exaggerating everything, filled him with admiration of our 
<A NAME="545"></A>ancient system. Next day Tiridates begged for time which, as he was about 
<A NAME="546"></A>to enter on so long a journey, might suffice for a previous visit to his 
<A NAME="547"></A>brothers and his mother. Meanwhile he gave up his daughter as a hostage, 
<A NAME="548"></A>and prepared a suppliant letter to Nero.
<A NAME="549"></A><BR><BR>He then departed, and found Pacorus in Media, and Vologeses at 
<A NAME="550"></A>Ecbatana, who was by no means unconcerned for his brother. In fact, Vologeses 
<A NAME="551"></A>had entreated Corbulo by special messengers, that Tiridates might not have 
<A NAME="552"></A>to endure any badge of slavery, or have to deliver up his sword, or be 
<A NAME="553"></A>debarred the honour of embracing the governors of the provinces, or have 
<A NAME="554"></A>to present himself at their doors, and that he might be treated at Rome 
<A NAME="555"></A>with as much respect as the consuls. Accustomed, forsooth, to foreign arrogance, 
<A NAME="556"></A>he had no knowledge of us, who value the reality of empire and disregard 
<A NAME="557"></A>its empty show.
<A NAME="558"></A><BR><BR>That same year the emperor put into possession of the Latin franchise 
<A NAME="559"></A>the tribes of the maritime Alps. To the Roman knights he assigned places 
<A NAME="560"></A>in the circus in front of the seats of the people, for up to that time 
<A NAME="561"></A>they used to enter in a promiscuous throng, as the Roscian law extended 
<A NAME="562"></A>only to fourteen rows in the theatre. The same year witnessed shows of 
<A NAME="563"></A>gladiators as magnificent as those of the past. Many ladies of distinction, 
<A NAME="564"></A>however, and senators, disgraced themselves by appearing in the 
<A NAME="565"></A>amphitheatre.
<A NAME="566"></A><BR><BR>In the year of the consulship of Caius Laecanius and Marcus Licinius 
<A NAME="567"></A>a yet keener impulse urged Nero to show himself frequently on the public 
<A NAME="568"></A>stage. Hitherto he had sung in private houses or gardens, during the juvenile 
<A NAME="569"></A>games, but these he now despised, as being but little frequented, and on 
<A NAME="570"></A>too small a scale for so fine a voice. As, however, he did not venture 
<A NAME="571"></A>to make a beginning at Rome, he chose Neapolis, because it was a Greek 
<A NAME="572"></A>city. From this as his starting-point he might cross into Achaia, and there, 
<A NAME="573"></A>winning the well-known and sacred garlands of antiquity, evoke, with increased 
<A NAME="574"></A>fame, the enthusiasm of the citizens. Accordingly, a rabble of the townsfolk 
<A NAME="575"></A>was brought together, with those whom the excitement of such an event had 
<A NAME="576"></A>attracted from the neighbouring towns and colonies, and such as followed 
<A NAME="577"></A>in the emperor's train to pay him honour or for various objects. All these, 
<A NAME="578"></A>with some companies of soldiers, filled the theatre at 
<A NAME="579"></A>Neapolis.
<A NAME="580"></A><BR><BR>There an incident occurred, which many thought unlucky, though 
<A NAME="581"></A>to the emperor it seemed due to the providence of auspicious deities. The 
<A NAME="582"></A>people who had been present, had quitted the theatre, and the empty building 
<A NAME="583"></A>then fell in without harm to anyone. Thereupon Nero in an elaborate ode 
<A NAME="584"></A>thanked the gods, celebrating the good luck which attended the late downfall, 
<A NAME="585"></A>and as he was on his way to cross the sea of Hadria, he rested awhile at 
<A NAME="586"></A>Beneventum, where a crowded gladiatorial show was being exhibited by Vatinius. 
<A NAME="587"></A>The man was one of the most conspicuously infamous sights in the imperial 
<A NAME="588"></A>court, bred, as he had been, in a shoemaker's shop, of a deformed person 
<A NAME="589"></A>and vulgar wit, originally introduced as a butt. After a time he grew so 
<A NAME="590"></A>powerful by accusing all the best men, that in influence, wealth, and ability 
<A NAME="591"></A>to injure, he was pre-eminent even in that bad company.
<A NAME="592"></A><BR><BR>While Nero was frequently visiting the show, even amid his pleasures 
<A NAME="593"></A>there was no cessation to his crimes. For during the very same period Torquatus 
<A NAME="594"></A>Silanus was forced to die, because over and above his illustrious rank 
<A NAME="595"></A>as one of the Junian family he claimed to be the great-grandson of Augustus. 
<A NAME="596"></A>Accusers were ordered to charge him with prodigality in lavishing gifts, 
<A NAME="597"></A>and with having no hope but in revolution. They said further that he had 
<A NAME="598"></A>nobles about him for his letters, books, and accounts, titles all and rehearsals 
<A NAME="599"></A>of supreme power. Then the most intimate of his freedmen were put in chains 
<A NAME="600"></A>and torn from him, till, knowing the doom which impended, Torquatus divided 
<A NAME="601"></A>the arteries in his arms. A speech from Nero followed, as usual, which 
<A NAME="602"></A>stated that though he was guilty and with good reason distrusted his defence, 
<A NAME="603"></A>he would yet have lived, had he awaited the clemency of the 
<A NAME="604"></A>judge.
<A NAME="605"></A><BR><BR>Soon afterwards, giving up Achaia for the present (his reasons 
<A NAME="606"></A>were not certainly known), he returned to Rome, there dwelling in his secret 
<A NAME="607"></A>imaginations on the provinces of the east, especially Egypt. Then having 
<A NAME="608"></A>declared in a public proclamation that his absence would not be long and 
<A NAME="609"></A>that all things in the State would remain unchanged and prosperous, he 
<A NAME="610"></A>visited the temple of the Capitol for advice about his departure. There 
<A NAME="611"></A>he adored the gods; then he entered also the temple of Vesta, and there 
<A NAME="612"></A>feeling a sudden trembling throughout his limbs, either from terror inspired 
<A NAME="613"></A>by the deity or because, from the remembrance of his crimes, he was never 
<A NAME="614"></A>free from fear, he relinquished his purpose, repeatedly saying that all 
<A NAME="615"></A>his plans were of less account than his love of his country. "He had seen 
<A NAME="616"></A>the sad countenances of the citizens, he heard their secret complainings 
<A NAME="617"></A>at the prospect of his entering on so long a journey, when they could not 
<A NAME="618"></A>bear so much as his brief excursions, accustomed as they were to cheer 
<A NAME="619"></A>themselves under mischances by the sight of the emperor. Hence, as in private 
<A NAME="620"></A>relationships the closest ties were the strongest, so the people of Rome 
<A NAME="621"></A>had the most powerful claims and must be obeyed in their wish to retain 
<A NAME="622"></A>him."
<A NAME="623"></A><BR><BR>These and the like sentiments suited the people, who craved amusement, 
<A NAME="624"></A>and feared, always their chief anxiety, scarcity of corn, should he be 
<A NAME="625"></A>absent. The Senate and leading citizens were in doubt whether to regard 
<A NAME="626"></A>him as more terrible at a distance or among them. After a while, as is 
<A NAME="627"></A>the way with great terrors, they thought what happened the worst 
<A NAME="628"></A>alternative.
<A NAME="629"></A><BR><BR>Nero, to win credit for himself of enjoying nothing so much as 
<A NAME="630"></A>the capital, prepared banquets in the public places, and used the whole 
<A NAME="631"></A>city, so to say, as his private house. Of these entertainments the most 
<A NAME="632"></A>famous for their notorious profligacy were those furnished by Tigellinus, 
<A NAME="633"></A>which I will describe as an illustration, that I may not have again and 
<A NAME="634"></A>again to narrate similar extravagance. He had a raft constructed on Agrippa's 
<A NAME="635"></A>lake, put the guests on board and set it in motion by other vessels towing 
<A NAME="636"></A>it. These vessels glittered with gold and ivory; the crews were arranged 
<A NAME="637"></A>according to age and experience in vice. Birds and beasts had been procured 
<A NAME="638"></A>from remote countries, and sea monsters from the ocean. On the margin of 
<A NAME="639"></A>the lake were set up brothels crowded with noble ladies, and on the opposite 
<A NAME="640"></A>bank were seen naked prostitutes with obscene gestures and movements. As 
<A NAME="641"></A>darkness approached, all the adjacent grove and surrounding buildings resounded 
<A NAME="642"></A>with song, and shone brilliantly with lights. Nero, who polluted himself 
<A NAME="643"></A>by every lawful or lawless indulgence, had not omitted a single abomination 
<A NAME="644"></A>which could heighten his depravity, till a few days afterwards he stooped 
<A NAME="645"></A>to marry himself to one of that filthy herd, by name Pythagoras, with all 
<A NAME="646"></A>the forms of regular wedlock. The bridal veil was put over the emperor; 
<A NAME="647"></A>people saw the witnesses of the ceremony, the wedding dower, the couch 
<A NAME="648"></A>and the nuptial torches; everything in a word was plainly visible, which, 
<A NAME="649"></A>even when a woman weds darkness hides.
<A NAME="650"></A><BR><BR>A disaster followed, whether accidental or treacherously contrived 
<A NAME="651"></A>by the emperor, is uncertain, as authors have given both accounts, worse, 
<A NAME="652"></A>however, and more dreadful than any which have ever happened to this city 
<A NAME="653"></A>by the violence of fire. It had its beginning in that part of the circus 
<A NAME="654"></A>which adjoins the Palatine and Caelian hills, where, amid the shops containing 
<A NAME="655"></A>inflammable wares, the conflagration both broke out and instantly became 
<A NAME="656"></A>so fierce and so rapid from the wind that it seized in its grasp the entire 
<A NAME="657"></A>length of the circus. For here there were no houses fenced in by solid 
<A NAME="658"></A>masonry, or temples surrounded by walls, or any other obstacle to interpose 
<A NAME="659"></A>delay. The blaze in its fury ran first through the level portions of the 
<A NAME="660"></A>city, then rising to the hills, while it again devastated every place below 
<A NAME="661"></A>them, it outstripped all preventive measures; so rapid was the mischief 
<A NAME="662"></A>and so completely at its mercy the city, with those narrow winding passages 
<A NAME="663"></A>and irregular streets, which characterised old Rome. Added to this were 
<A NAME="664"></A>the wailings of terror-stricken women, the feebleness of age, the helpless 
<A NAME="665"></A>inexperience of childhood, the crowds who sought to save themselves or 
<A NAME="666"></A>others, dragging out the infirm or waiting for them, and by their hurry 
<A NAME="667"></A>in the one case, by their delay in the other, aggravating the confusion. 
<A NAME="668"></A>Often, while they looked behind them, they were intercepted by flames on 
<A NAME="669"></A>their side or in their face. Or if they reached a refuge close at hand, 
<A NAME="670"></A>when this too was seized by the fire, they found that, even places, which 
<A NAME="671"></A>they had imagined to be remote, were involved in the same calamity. At 
<A NAME="672"></A>last, doubting what they should avoid or whither betake themselves, they 
<A NAME="673"></A>crowded the streets or flung themselves down in the fields, while some 
<A NAME="674"></A>who had lost their all, even their very daily bread, and others out of 
<A NAME="675"></A>love for their kinsfolk, whom they had been unable to rescue, perished, 
<A NAME="676"></A>though escape was open to them. And no one dared to stop the mischief, 
<A NAME="677"></A>because of incessant menaces from a number of persons who forbade the extinguishing 
<A NAME="678"></A>of the flames, because again others openly hurled brands, and kept shouting 
<A NAME="679"></A>that there was one who gave them authority, either seeking to plunder more 
<A NAME="680"></A>freely, or obeying orders.
<A NAME="681"></A><BR><BR>Nero at this time was at Antium, and did not return to Rome until 
<A NAME="682"></A>the fire approached his house, which he had built to connect the palace 
<A NAME="683"></A>with the gardens of Maecenas. It could not, however, be stopped from devouring 
<A NAME="684"></A>the palace, the house, and everything around it. However, to relieve the 
<A NAME="685"></A>people, driven out homeless as they were, he threw open to them the Campus 
<A NAME="686"></A>Martius and the public buildings of Agrippa, and even his own gardens, 
<A NAME="687"></A>and raised temporary structures to receive the destitute multitude. Supplies 
<A NAME="688"></A>of food were brought up from Ostia and the neighbouring towns, and the 
<A NAME="689"></A>price of corn was reduced to three sesterces a peck. These acts, though 
<A NAME="690"></A>popular, produced no effect, since a rumour had gone forth everywhere that, 
<A NAME="691"></A>at the very time when the city was in flames, the emperor appeared on a 
<A NAME="692"></A>private stage and sang of the destruction of Troy, comparing present misfortunes 
<A NAME="693"></A>with the calamities of antiquity.
<A NAME="694"></A><BR><BR>At last, after five days, an end was put to the conflagration at 
<A NAME="695"></A>the foot of the Esquiline hill, by the destruction of all buildings on 
<A NAME="696"></A>a vast space, so that the violence of the fire was met by clear ground 
<A NAME="697"></A>and an open sky. But before people had laid aside their fears, the flames 
<A NAME="698"></A>returned, with no less fury this second time, and especially in the spacious 
<A NAME="699"></A>districts of the city. Consequently, though there was less loss of life, 
<A NAME="700"></A>the temples of the gods, and the porticoes which were devoted to enjoyment, 
<A NAME="701"></A>fell in a yet more widespread ruin. And to this conflagration there attached 
<A NAME="702"></A>the greater infamy because it broke out on the Aemilian property of Tigellinus, 
<A NAME="703"></A>and it seemed that Nero was aiming at the glory of founding a new city 
<A NAME="704"></A>and calling it by his name. Rome, indeed, is divided into fourteen districts, 
<A NAME="705"></A>four of which remained uninjured, three were levelled to the ground, while 
<A NAME="706"></A>in the other seven were left only a few shattered, half-burnt relics of 
<A NAME="707"></A>houses.
<A NAME="708"></A><BR><BR>It would not be easy to enter into a computation of the private 
<A NAME="709"></A>mansions, the blocks of tenements, and of the temples, which were lost. 
<A NAME="710"></A>Those with the oldest ceremonial, as that dedicated by Servius Tullius 
<A NAME="711"></A>to Luna, the great altar and shrine raised by the Arcadian Evander to the 
<A NAME="712"></A>visibly appearing Hercules, the temple of Jupiter the Stayer, which was 
<A NAME="713"></A>vowed by Romulus, Numa's royal palace, and the sanctuary of Vesta, with 
<A NAME="714"></A>the tutelary deities of the Roman people, were burnt. So too were the riches 
<A NAME="715"></A>acquired by our many victories, various beauties of Greek art, then again 
<A NAME="716"></A>the ancient and genuine historical monuments of men of genius, and, notwithstanding 
<A NAME="717"></A>the striking splendour of the restored city, old men will remember many 
<A NAME="718"></A>things which could not be replaced. Some persons observed that the beginning 
<A NAME="719"></A>of this conflagration was on the 19th of July, the day on which the Senones 
<A NAME="720"></A>captured and fired Rome. Others have pushed a curious inquiry so far as 
<A NAME="721"></A>to reduce the interval between these two conflagrations into equal numbers 
<A NAME="722"></A>of years, months, and days.
<A NAME="723"></A><BR><BR>Nero meanwhile availed himself of his country's desolation, and 
<A NAME="724"></A>erected a mansion in which the jewels and gold, long familiar objects, 
<A NAME="725"></A>quite vulgarised by our extravagance, were not so marvellous as the fields 
<A NAME="726"></A>and lakes, with woods on one side to resemble a wilderness, and, on the 
<A NAME="727"></A>other, open spaces and extensive views. The directors and contrivers of 
<A NAME="728"></A>the work were Severus and Celer, who had the genius and the audacity to 
<A NAME="729"></A>attempt by art even what nature had refused, and to fool away an emperor's 
<A NAME="730"></A>resources. They had actually undertaken to sink a navigable canal from 
<A NAME="731"></A>the lake Avernus to the mouths of the Tiber along a barren shore or through 
<A NAME="732"></A>the face of hills, where one meets with no moisture which could supply 
<A NAME="733"></A>water, except the Pomptine marshes. The rest of the country is broken rock 
<A NAME="734"></A>and perfectly dry. Even if it could be cut through, the labour would be 
<A NAME="735"></A>intolerable, and there would be no adequate result. Nero, however, with 
<A NAME="736"></A>his love of the impossible, endeavoured to dig through the nearest hills 
<A NAME="737"></A>to Avernus, and there still remain the traces of his disappointed 
<A NAME="738"></A>hope.
<A NAME="739"></A><BR><BR>Of Rome meanwhile, so much as was left unoccupied by his mansion, 
<A NAME="740"></A>was not built up, as it had been after its burning by the Gauls, without 
<A NAME="741"></A>any regularity or in any fashion, but with rows of streets according to 
<A NAME="742"></A>measurement, with broad thoroughfares, with a restriction on the height 
<A NAME="743"></A>of houses, with open spaces, and the further addition of colonnades, as 
<A NAME="744"></A>a protection to the frontage of the blocks of tenements. These colonnades 
<A NAME="745"></A>Nero promised to erect at his own expense, and to hand over the open spaces, 
<A NAME="746"></A>when cleared of the debris, to the ground landlords. He also offered rewards 
<A NAME="747"></A>proportioned to each person's position and property, and prescribed a period 
<A NAME="748"></A>within which they were to obtain them on the completion of so many houses 
<A NAME="749"></A>or blocks of building. He fixed on the marshes of Ostia for the reception 
<A NAME="750"></A>of the rubbish, and arranged that the ships which had brought up corn by 
<A NAME="751"></A>the Tiber, should sail down the river with cargoes of this rubbish. The 
<A NAME="752"></A>buildings themselves, to a certain height, were to be solidly constructed, 
<A NAME="753"></A>without wooden beams, of stone from Gabii or Alba, that material being 
<A NAME="754"></A>impervious to fire. And to provide that the water which individual license 
<A NAME="755"></A>had illegally appropriated, might flow in greater abundance in several 
<A NAME="756"></A>places for the public use, officers were appointed, and everyone was to 
<A NAME="757"></A>have in the open court the means of stopping a fire. Every building, too, 
<A NAME="758"></A>was to be enclosed by its own proper wall, not by one common to others. 
<A NAME="759"></A>These changes which were liked for their utility, also added beauty to 
<A NAME="760"></A>the new city. Some, however, thought that its old arrangement had been 
<A NAME="761"></A>more conducive to health, inasmuch as the narrow streets with the elevation 
<A NAME="762"></A>of the roofs were not equally penetrated by the sun's heat, while now the 
<A NAME="763"></A>open space, unsheltered by any shade, was scorched by a fiercer 
<A NAME="764"></A>glow.
<A NAME="765"></A><BR><BR>Such indeed were the precautions of human wisdom. The next thing 
<A NAME="766"></A>was to seek means of propitiating the gods, and recourse was had to the 
<A NAME="767"></A>Sibylline books, by the direction of which prayers were offered to Vulcanus, 
<A NAME="768"></A>Ceres, and Proserpina. Juno, too, was entreated by the matrons, first, 
<A NAME="769"></A>in the Capitol, then on the nearest part of the coast, whence water was 
<A NAME="770"></A>procured to sprinkle the fane and image of the goddess. And there were 
<A NAME="771"></A>sacred banquets and nightly vigils celebrated by married women. But all 
<A NAME="772"></A>human efforts, all the lavish gifts of the emperor, and the propitiations 
<A NAME="773"></A>of the gods, did not banish the sinister belief that the conflagration 
<A NAME="774"></A>was the result of an order. Consequently, to get rid of the report, Nero 
<A NAME="775"></A>fastened the guilt and inflicted the most exquisite tortures on a class 
<A NAME="776"></A>hated for their abominations, called Christians by the populace. Christus, 
<A NAME="777"></A>from whom the name had its origin, suffered the extreme penalty during 
<A NAME="778"></A>the reign of Tiberius at the hands of one of our procurators, Pontius Pilatus, 
<A NAME="779"></A>and a most mischievous superstition, thus checked for the moment, again 
<A NAME="780"></A>broke out not only in Judaea, the first source of the evil, but even in 
<A NAME="781"></A>Rome, where all things hideous and shameful from every part of the world 
<A NAME="782"></A>find their centre and become popular. Accordingly, an arrest was first 
<A NAME="783"></A>made of all who pleaded guilty; then, upon their information, an immense 
<A NAME="784"></A>multitude was convicted, not so much of the crime of firing the city, as 
<A NAME="785"></A>of hatred against mankind. Mockery of every sort was added to their deaths. 
<A NAME="786"></A>Covered with the skins of beasts, they were torn by dogs and perished, 
<A NAME="787"></A>or were nailed to crosses, or were doomed to the flames and burnt, to serve 
<A NAME="788"></A>as a nightly illumination, when daylight had expired.
<A NAME="789"></A><BR><BR>Nero offered his gardens for the spectacle, and was exhibiting 
<A NAME="790"></A>a show in the circus, while he mingled with the people in the dress of 
<A NAME="791"></A>a charioteer or stood aloft on a car. Hence, even for criminals who deserved 
<A NAME="792"></A>extreme and exemplary punishment, there arose a feeling of compassion; 
<A NAME="793"></A>for it was not, as it seemed, for the public good, but to glut one man's 
<A NAME="794"></A>cruelty, that they were being destroyed.
<A NAME="795"></A><BR><BR>Meanwhile Italy was thoroughly exhausted by contributions of money, 
<A NAME="796"></A>the provinces were ruined, as also the allied nations and the free states, 
<A NAME="797"></A>as they were called. Even the gods fell victims to the plunder; for the 
<A NAME="798"></A>temples in Rome were despoiled and the gold carried off, which, for a triumph 
<A NAME="799"></A>or a vow, the Roman people in every age had consecrated in their prosperity 
<A NAME="800"></A>or their alarm. Throughout Asia and Achaia not only votive gifts, but the 
<A NAME="801"></A>images of deities were seized, Acratus and Secundus Carinas having been 
<A NAME="802"></A>sent into those provinces. The first was a freedman ready for any wickedness; 
<A NAME="803"></A>the latter, as far as speech went, was thoroughly trained in Greek learning, 
<A NAME="804"></A>but he had not imbued his heart with sound principles. Seneca, it was said, 
<A NAME="805"></A>to avert from himself the obloquy of sacrilege, begged for the seclusion 
<A NAME="806"></A>of a remote rural retreat, and, when it was refused, feigning ill health, 
<A NAME="807"></A>as though he had a nervous ailment, would not quit his chamber. According 
<A NAME="808"></A>to some writers, poison was prepared for him at Nero's command by his own 
<A NAME="809"></A>freedman, whose name was Cleonicus. This Seneca avoided through the freedman's 
<A NAME="810"></A>disclosure, or his own apprehension, while he used to support life on the 
<A NAME="811"></A>very simple diet of wild fruits, with water from a running stream when 
<A NAME="812"></A>thirst prompted.
<A NAME="813"></A><BR><BR>During the same time some gladiators in the town of Praeneste, 
<A NAME="814"></A>who attempted to break loose, were put down by a military guard stationed 
<A NAME="815"></A>on the spot to watch them, and the people, ever desirous and yet fearful 
<A NAME="816"></A>of change, began at once to talk of Spartacus, and of bygone calamities. 
<A NAME="817"></A>Soon afterwards, tidings of a naval disaster was received, but not from 
<A NAME="818"></A>war, for never had there been so profound a peace. Nero, however, had ordered 
<A NAME="819"></A>the fleet to return to Campania on a fixed day, without making any allowance 
<A NAME="820"></A>for the dangers of the sea. Consequently the pilots, in spite of the fury 
<A NAME="821"></A>of the waves, started from Formiae, and while they were struggling to double 
<A NAME="822"></A>the promontory of Misenum, they were dashed by a violent south-west wind 
<A NAME="823"></A>on the shores of Cumae, and lost, in all directions, a number of their 
<A NAME="824"></A>triremes with some smaller vessels.
<A NAME="825"></A><BR><BR>At the close of the year people talked much about prodigies, presaging 
<A NAME="826"></A>impending evils. Never were lightning flashes more frequent, and a comet 
<A NAME="827"></A>too appeared, for which Nero always made propitiation with noble blood. 
<A NAME="828"></A>Human and other births with two heads were exposed to public view, or were 
<A NAME="829"></A>discovered in those sacrifices in which it is usual to immolate victims 
<A NAME="830"></A>in a pregnant condition. And in the district of Placentia, close to the 
<A NAME="831"></A>road, a calf was born with its head attached to its leg. Then followed 
<A NAME="832"></A>an explanation of the diviners, that another head was preparing for the 
<A NAME="833"></A>world, which however would be neither mighty nor hidden, as its growth 
<A NAME="834"></A>had been checked in the womb, and it had been born by the 
<A NAME="835"></A>wayside.
<A NAME="836"></A><BR><BR>Silius Nerva and Atticus Vestinus then entered on the consulship, 
<A NAME="837"></A>and now a conspiracy was planned, and at once became formidable, for which 
<A NAME="838"></A>senators, knights, soldiers, even women, had given their names with eager 
<A NAME="839"></A>rivalry, out of hatred of Nero as well as a liking for Caius Piso. A descendant 
<A NAME="840"></A>of the Calpurnian house, and embracing in his connections through his father's 
<A NAME="841"></A>noble rank many illustrious families, Piso had a splendid reputation with 
<A NAME="842"></A>the people from his virtue or semblance of virtue. His eloquence he exercised 
<A NAME="843"></A>in the defence of fellow-citizens, his generosity towards friends, while 
<A NAME="844"></A>even for strangers he had a courteous address and demeanour. He had, too, 
<A NAME="845"></A>the fortuitous advantages of tall stature and a handsome face. But solidity 
<A NAME="846"></A>of character and moderation in pleasure were wholly alien to him. He indulged 
<A NAME="847"></A>in laxity, in display, and occasionally in excess. This suited the taste 
<A NAME="848"></A>of that numerous class who, when the attractions of vice are so powerful, 
<A NAME="849"></A>do not wish for strictness or special severity on the 
<A NAME="850"></A>throne.
<A NAME="851"></A><BR><BR>The origin of the conspiracy was not in Piso's personal ambition. 
<A NAME="852"></A>But I could not easily narrate who first planned it, or whose prompting 
<A NAME="853"></A>inspired a scheme into which so many entered. That the leading spirits 
<A NAME="854"></A>were Subrius Flavus, tribune of a praetorian cohort, and Sulpicius Asper, 
<A NAME="855"></A>a centurion, was proved by the fearlessness of their death. Lucanus Annaeus, 
<A NAME="856"></A>too, and Plautius Lateranus, imported into it an intensely keen resentment. 
<A NAME="857"></A>Lucanus had the stimulus of personal motives, for Nero tried to disparage 
<A NAME="858"></A>the fame of his poems and, with the foolish vanity of a rival, had forbidden 
<A NAME="859"></A>him to publish them. As for Lateranus, a consul-elect, it was no wrong, 
<A NAME="860"></A>but love of the State which linked him with the others. Flavius Scaevinus 
<A NAME="861"></A>and Afranius Quintianus, on the other hand, both of senatorian rank, contrary 
<A NAME="862"></A>to what was expected of them, undertook the beginning of this daring crime. 
<A NAME="863"></A>Scaevinus, indeed, had enfeebled his mind by excess, and his life, accordingly, 
<A NAME="864"></A>was one of sleepy languor. Quintianus, infamous for his effeminate vice, 
<A NAME="865"></A>had been satirised by Nero in a lampoon, and was bent on avenging the 
<A NAME="866"></A>insult.
<A NAME="867"></A><BR><BR>So, while they dropped hints among themselves or among their friends 
<A NAME="868"></A>about the emperor's crimes, the approaching end of empire, and the importance 
<A NAME="869"></A>of choosing some one to rescue the State in its distress, they associated 
<A NAME="870"></A>with them Tullius Senecio, Cervarius Proculus, Vulcatius Araricus, Julius 
<A NAME="871"></A>Augurinus, Munatius Gratus, Antonius Natalis, and Marcius Festus, all Roman 
<A NAME="872"></A>knights. Of these Senecio, one of those who was specially intimate with 
<A NAME="873"></A>Nero, still kept up a show of friendship, and had consequently to struggle 
<A NAME="874"></A>with all the more dangers. Natalis shared with Piso all his secret plans. 
<A NAME="875"></A>The rest built their hopes on revolution. Besides Subrius and Sulpicius, 
<A NAME="876"></A>whom I have already mentioned, they invited the aid of military strength, 
<A NAME="877"></A>of Gavius Silvanus and Statius Proximus, tribunes of praetorian cohorts, 
<A NAME="878"></A>and of two centurions, Maximus Scaurus and Venetus Paulus. But their mainstay, 
<A NAME="879"></A>it was thought, was Faenius Rufus, the commander of the guard, a man of 
<A NAME="880"></A>esteemed life and character, to whom Tigellinus with his brutality and 
<A NAME="881"></A>shamelessness was superior in the emperor's regard. He harassed him with 
<A NAME="882"></A>calumnies, and had often put him in terror by hinting that he had been 
<A NAME="883"></A>Agrippina's paramour, and from sorrow at her loss was intent on vengeance. 
<A NAME="884"></A>And so, when the conspirators were assured by his own repeated language 
<A NAME="885"></A>that the commander of the praetorian guard had come over to their side, 
<A NAME="886"></A>they once more eagerly discussed the time and place of the fatal deed. 
<A NAME="887"></A>It was said that Subrius Flavus had formed a sudden resolution to attack 
<A NAME="888"></A>Nero when singing on the stage, or when his house was in flames and he 
<A NAME="889"></A>was running hither and thither, unattended, in the darkness. In the one 
<A NAME="890"></A>case was the opportunity of solitude; in the other, the very crowd which 
<A NAME="891"></A>would witness so glorious a deed, had roused a singularly noble soul; it 
<A NAME="892"></A>was only the desire of escape, that foe to all great enterprises, which 
<A NAME="893"></A>held him back.
<A NAME="894"></A><BR><BR>Meanwhile, as they hesitated in prolonged suspense between hope 
<A NAME="895"></A>and fear, a certain Epicharis (how she informed herself is uncertain, as 
<A NAME="896"></A>she had never before had a thought of anything noble) began to stir and 
<A NAME="897"></A>upbraid the conspirators. Wearied at last of their long delay, she endeavoured, 
<A NAME="898"></A>when staying in Campania, to shake the loyalty of the officers of the fleet 
<A NAME="899"></A>at Misenum, and to entangle them in a guilty complicity. She began thus. 
<A NAME="900"></A>There was a captain in the fleet, Volusius Proculus, who had been one of 
<A NAME="901"></A>Nero's instruments in his mother's murder, and had not, as he thought, 
<A NAME="902"></A>been promoted in proportion to the greatness of his crime. Either, as an 
<A NAME="903"></A>old acquaintance of the woman, or on the strength of a recent intimacy, 
<A NAME="904"></A>he divulged to her his services to Nero and their barren result to himself, 
<A NAME="905"></A>adding complaints, and his determination to have vengeance, should the 
<A NAME="906"></A>chance arise. He thus inspired the hope that he could be persuaded, and 
<A NAME="907"></A>could secure many others. No small help was to be found in the fleet, and 
<A NAME="908"></A>there would be numerous opportunities, as Nero delighted in frequent enjoyment 
<A NAME="909"></A>of the sea off Puteoli and Misenum.
<A NAME="910"></A><BR><BR>Epicharis accordingly said more, and began the history of all the 
<A NAME="911"></A>emperor's crimes. "The Senate," she affirmed, "had no power left it; yet 
<A NAME="912"></A>means had been provided whereby he might pay the penalty of having destroyed 
<A NAME="913"></A>the State. Only let Proculus gird himself to do his part and bring over 
<A NAME="914"></A>to their side his bravest soldiers, and then look for an adequate recompense." 
<A NAME="915"></A>The conspirators' names, however, she withheld. Consequently the information 
<A NAME="916"></A>of Proculus was useless, even though he reported what he had heard to Nero. 
<A NAME="917"></A>For Epicharis being summoned and confronted with the informer easily silenced 
<A NAME="918"></A>him, unsupported as he was by a single witness. But she was herself detained 
<A NAME="919"></A>in custody, for Nero suspected that even what was not proved to be true, 
<A NAME="920"></A>was not wholly false.
<A NAME="921"></A><BR><BR>The conspirators, however, alarmed by the fear of disclosure, resolved 
<A NAME="922"></A>to hurry on the assassination at Baiae, in Piso's villa, whither the emperor, 
<A NAME="923"></A>charmed by its loveliness, often went, and where, unguarded and without 
<A NAME="924"></A>the cumbrous grandeur of his rank, he would enjoy the bath and the banquet. 
<A NAME="925"></A>But Piso refused, alleging the odium of an act which would stain with an 
<A NAME="926"></A>emperor's blood, however bad he might be, the sanctity of the hospitable 
<A NAME="927"></A>board and the deities who preside over it. "Better," he said, "in the capital, 
<A NAME="928"></A>in that hateful mansion which was piled up with the plunder of the citizens, 
<A NAME="929"></A>or in public, to accomplish what on the State's behalf they had 
<A NAME="930"></A>undertaken."
<A NAME="931"></A><BR><BR>So he said openly, with however a secret apprehension that Lucius 
<A NAME="932"></A>Silanus might, on the strength of his distinguished rank and the teachings 
<A NAME="933"></A>of Caius Cassius, under whom he had been trained, aspire to any greatness 
<A NAME="934"></A>and seize an empire, which would be promptly offered him by all who had 
<A NAME="935"></A>no part in the conspiracy, and who would pity Nero as the victim of a crime. 
<A NAME="936"></A>Many thought that Piso shunned also the enterprising spirit of Vestinus, 
<A NAME="937"></A>the consul, who might, he feared, rise up in the cause of freedom, or, 
<A NAME="938"></A>by choosing another emperor, make the State his own gift. Vestinus, indeed, 
<A NAME="939"></A>had no share in the conspiracy, though Nero on that charge gratified an 
<A NAME="940"></A>old resentment against an innocent man.
<A NAME="941"></A><BR><BR>At last they decided to carry out their design on that day of the 
<A NAME="942"></A>circus games, which is celebrated in honour of Ceres, as the emperor, who 
<A NAME="943"></A>seldom went out, and shut himself up in his house or gardens, used to go 
<A NAME="944"></A>to the entertainments of the circus, and access to him was the easier from 
<A NAME="945"></A>his keen enjoyment of the spectacle. They had so arranged the order of 
<A NAME="946"></A>the plot, that Lateranus was to throw himself at the prince's knees in 
<A NAME="947"></A>earnest entreaty, apparently craving relief for his private necessities, 
<A NAME="948"></A>and, being a man of strong nerve and huge frame, hurl him to the ground 
<A NAME="949"></A>and hold him down. When he was prostrate and powerless, the tribunes and 
<A NAME="950"></A>centurions and all the others who had sufficient daring were to rush up 
<A NAME="951"></A>and do the murder, the first blow being claimed by Scaevinus, who had taken 
<A NAME="952"></A>a dagger from the Temple of Safety, or, according to another account, from 
<A NAME="953"></A>that of Fortune, in the town of Ferentum, and used to wear the weapon as 
<A NAME="954"></A>though dedicated to some noble deed. Piso, meanwhile, was wait in the sanctuary 
<A NAME="955"></A>of Ceres, whence he was to be summoned by Faenius, the commander of the 
<A NAME="956"></A>guard, and by the others, and then conveyed into the camp, accompanied 
<A NAME="957"></A>by Antonia, the daughter of Claudius Caesar, with a view to evoke the people's 
<A NAME="958"></A>enthusiasm. So it is related by Caius Pliny. Handed down from whatever 
<A NAME="959"></A>source, I had no intention of suppressing it, however absurd it may seem, 
<A NAME="960"></A>either that Antonia should have lent her name at her life's peril to a 
<A NAME="961"></A>hopeless project, or that Piso, with his well-known affection for his wife, 
<A NAME="962"></A>should have pledged himself to another marriage, but for the fact that 
<A NAME="963"></A>the lust of dominion inflames the heart more than any other 
<A NAME="964"></A>passion.
<A NAME="965"></A><BR><BR>It was however wonderful how among people of different class, rank, 
<A NAME="966"></A>age, sex, among rich and poor, everything was kept in secrecy till betrayal 
<A NAME="967"></A>began from the house of Scaevinus. The day before the treacherous attempt, 
<A NAME="968"></A>after a long conversation with Antonius Natalis, Scaevinus returned home, 
<A NAME="969"></A>sealed his will, and, drawing from its sheath the dagger of which I have 
<A NAME="970"></A>already spoken, and complaining that it was blunted from long disuse, he 
<A NAME="971"></A>ordered it to be sharpened on a stone to a keen and bright point. This 
<A NAME="972"></A>task he assigned to his freedman Milichus. At the same time sat down to 
<A NAME="973"></A>a more than usually sumptuous banquet, and gave his favourite slaves their 
<A NAME="974"></A>freedom, and money to others. He was himself depressed, and evidently in 
<A NAME="975"></A>profound thought, though he affected gaiety in desultory conversation. 
<A NAME="976"></A>Last of all, he directed ligatures for wounds and the means of stanching 
<A NAME="977"></A>blood to be prepared by the same Milichus, who either knew of the conspiracy 
<A NAME="978"></A>and was faithful up to this point, or was in complete ignorance and then 
<A NAME="979"></A>first caught suspicions, as most authors have inferred from what followed. 
<A NAME="980"></A>For when his servile imagination dwelt on the rewards of perfidy, and he 
<A NAME="981"></A>saw before him at the same moment boundless wealth and power, conscience 
<A NAME="982"></A>and care for his patron's life, together with the remembrance of the freedom 
<A NAME="983"></A>he had received, fled from him. From his wife, too, he had adopted a womanly 
<A NAME="984"></A>and yet baser suggestion; for she even held over him a dreadful thought, 
<A NAME="985"></A>that many had been present, both freedmen and slaves, who had seen what 
<A NAME="986"></A>he had; that one man's silence would be useless, whereas the rewards would 
<A NAME="987"></A>be for him alone who was first with the information.
<A NAME="988"></A><BR><BR>Accordingly at daybreak Milichus went to the Servilian gardens, 
<A NAME="989"></A>and, finding the doors shut against him, said again and again that he was 
<A NAME="990"></A>the bearer of important and alarming news. Upon this he was conducted by 
<A NAME="991"></A>the gatekeepers to one of Nero's freedmen, Epaphroditus, and by him to 
<A NAME="992"></A>Nero, whom he informed of the urgent danger, of the formidable conspiracy, 
<A NAME="993"></A>and of all else which he had heard or inferred. He showed him too the weapon 
<A NAME="994"></A>prepared for his destruction, and bade him summon the 
<A NAME="995"></A>accused.
<A NAME="996"></A><BR><BR>Scaevinus on being arrested by the soldiers began his defence with 
<A NAME="997"></A>the reply that the dagger about which he was accused, had of old been regarded 
<A NAME="998"></A>with a religious sentiment by his ancestors, that it had been kept in his 
<A NAME="999"></A>chamber, and been stolen by a trick of his freedman. He had often, he said, 
<A NAME="1000"></A>signed his will without heeding the observance of particular days, and 
<A NAME="1001"></A>had previously given presents of money as well as freedom to some of his 
<A NAME="1002"></A>slaves, only on this occasion he gave more freely, because, as his means 
<A NAME="1003"></A>were now impoverished and his creditors were pressing him, he distrusted 
<A NAME="1004"></A>the validity of his will. Certainly his table had always been profusely 
<A NAME="1005"></A>furnished, and his life luxurious, such as rigid censors would hardly approve. 
<A NAME="1006"></A>As to the bandages for wounds, none had been prepared at his order, but 
<A NAME="1007"></A>as all the man's other charges were absurd, he added an accusation in which 
<A NAME="1008"></A>he might make himself alike informer and witness.
<A NAME="1009"></A><BR><BR>He backed up his words by an air of resolution. Turning on his 
<A NAME="1010"></A>accuser, he denounced him as an infamous and depraved wretch, with so fearless 
<A NAME="1011"></A>a voice and look that the information was beginning to collapse, when Milichus 
<A NAME="1012"></A>was reminded by his wife that Antonious Natalis had had a long secret conversation 
<A NAME="1013"></A>with Scaevinus, and that both were Piso's intimate friends.
<A NAME="1014"></A><BR><BR>Natalis was therefore summoned, and they were separately asked 
<A NAME="1015"></A>what the conversation was, and what was its subject. Then a suspicion arose 
<A NAME="1016"></A>because their answers did not agree, and they were both put in irons. They 
<A NAME="1017"></A>could not endure the sight and the threat of torture. Natalis however, 
<A NAME="1018"></A>taking the initiative, knowing as he did more of the whole conspiracy, 
<A NAME="1019"></A>and being also more practised in accusing, first confessed about Piso, 
<A NAME="1020"></A>next added the name of Annaeus Seneca, either as having been a messenger 
<A NAME="1021"></A>between him and Piso, or to win the favour of Nero, who hated Seneca and 
<A NAME="1022"></A>sought every means for his ruin. Then Scaevinus too, when he knew the disclosure 
<A NAME="1023"></A>of Natalis, with like pusillanimity, or under the impression that everything 
<A NAME="1024"></A>now divulged, and that there could be no advantage in silence, revealed 
<A NAME="1025"></A>the other conspirators. Of these, Lucanus, Quintianus, and Senecio long 
<A NAME="1026"></A>persisted in denial; after a time, when bribed by the promise of impunity, 
<A NAME="1027"></A>anxious to excuse their reluctance, Lucanus named his mother Atilla, Quintianus 
<A NAME="1028"></A>and Senecio, their chief friends, respectively, Glitius Gallus and Annius 
<A NAME="1029"></A>Pollio.
<A NAME="1030"></A><BR><BR>Nero, meanwhile, remembering that Epicharis was in custody on the 
<A NAME="1031"></A>information of Volusius Proculus, and assuming that a woman's frame must 
<A NAME="1032"></A>be unequal to the agony, ordered her to be torn on the rack. But neither 
<A NAME="1033"></A>the scourge nor fire, nor the fury of the men as they increased the torture 
<A NAME="1034"></A>that they might not be a woman's scorn, overcame her positive denial of 
<A NAME="1035"></A>the charge. Thus the first day's inquiry was futile. On the morrow, as 
<A NAME="1036"></A>she was being dragged back on a chair to the same torments (for with her 
<A NAME="1037"></A>limbs all dislocated she could not stand), she tied a band, which she had 
<A NAME="1038"></A>stript off her bosom, in a sort of noose to the arched back of the chair, 
<A NAME="1039"></A>put her neck in it, and then straining with the whole weight of her body, 
<A NAME="1040"></A>wrung out of her frame its little remaining breath. All the nobler was 
<A NAME="1041"></A>the example set by a freedwoman at such a crisis in screening strangers 
<A NAME="1042"></A>and those whom she hardly knew, when freeborn men, Roman knights, and senators, 
<A NAME="1043"></A>yet unscathed by torture, betrayed, every one, his dearest kinsfolk. For 
<A NAME="1044"></A>even Lucanus and Senecio and Quintianus failed not to reveal their accomplices 
<A NAME="1045"></A>indiscriminately, and Nero was more and more alarmed, though he had fenced 
<A NAME="1046"></A>his person with a largely augmented guard.
<A NAME="1047"></A><BR><BR>Even Rome itself he put, so to say, under custody, garrisoning 
<A NAME="1048"></A>its walls with companies of soldiers and occupying with troops the coast 
<A NAME="1049"></A>and the river-banks. Incessantly were there flying through the public places, 
<A NAME="1050"></A>through private houses, country fields, and the neighbouring villages, 
<A NAME="1051"></A>horse and foot soldiers, mixed with Germans, whom the emperor trusted as 
<A NAME="1052"></A>being foreigners. In long succession, troops of prisoners in chains were 
<A NAME="1053"></A>dragged along and stood at the gates of his gardens. When they entered 
<A NAME="1054"></A>to plead their cause, a smile of joy on any of the conspirators, a casual 
<A NAME="1055"></A>conversation, a sudden meeting, or the fact of having entered a banquet 
<A NAME="1056"></A>or a public show in company, was construed into a crime, while to the savage 
<A NAME="1057"></A>questionings of Nero and Tigellinus were added the violent menaces of Faenius 
<A NAME="1058"></A>Rufus, who had not yet been named by the informers, but who, to get the 
<A NAME="1059"></A>credit of complete ignorance, frowned fiercely on his accomplices. When 
<A NAME="1060"></A>Subius Flavus at his side asked him by a sign whether he should draw his 
<A NAME="1061"></A>sword in the middle of the trial and perpetrate the fatal deed, Rufus refused, 
<A NAME="1062"></A>and checked the man's impulse as he was putting his hand to his 
<A NAME="1063"></A>sword-hilt.
<A NAME="1064"></A><BR><BR>Some there were who, as soon as the conspiracy was betrayed, urged 
<A NAME="1065"></A>Piso, while Milichus' story was being heard, and Scaevinus was hesitating, 
<A NAME="1066"></A>to go to the camp or mount the Rostra and test the feelings of the soldiers 
<A NAME="1067"></A>and of the people. "If," said they, "your accomplices join your enterprise, 
<A NAME="1068"></A>those also who are yet undecided, will follow, and great will be the fame 
<A NAME="1069"></A>of the movement once started, and this in any new scheme is all-powerful. 
<A NAME="1070"></A>Against it Nero has taken no precaution. Even brave men are dismayed by 
<A NAME="1071"></A>sudden perils; far less will that stageplayer, with Tigellinus forsooth 
<A NAME="1072"></A>and his concubines in his train, raise arms against you. Many things are 
<A NAME="1073"></A>accomplished on trial which cowards think arduous. It is vain to expect 
<A NAME="1074"></A>secrecy and fidelity from the varying tempers and bodily constitutions 
<A NAME="1075"></A>of such a host of accomplices. Torture or reward can overcome everything. 
<A NAME="1076"></A>Men will soon come to put you also in chains and inflict on you an ignominious 
<A NAME="1077"></A>death. How much more gloriously will you die while you cling to the State 
<A NAME="1078"></A>and invoke aid for liberty. Rather let the soldiers fail, the people be 
<A NAME="1079"></A>traitors, provided that you, if prematurely robbed of life, justify your 
<A NAME="1080"></A>death to your ancestors and descendants."
<A NAME="1081"></A><BR><BR>Unmoved by these considerations, Piso showed himself a few moments 
<A NAME="1082"></A>in public, then sought the retirement of his house, and there fortified 
<A NAME="1083"></A>his spirit against the worst, till a troop of soldiers arrived, raw recruits, 
<A NAME="1084"></A>or men recently enlisted, whom Nero had selected, because he was afraid 
<A NAME="1085"></A>of the veterans, imbued, though they were, with a liking for him. Piso 
<A NAME="1086"></A>expired by having the veins in his arms severed. His will, full of loathsome 
<A NAME="1087"></A>flatteries of Nero, was a concession to his love of his wife, a base woman, 
<A NAME="1088"></A>with only a beautiful person to recom
