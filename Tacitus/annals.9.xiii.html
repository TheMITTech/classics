<A NAME="start"></A>
<A NAME="10"></A>A.D. 54-58
<A NAME="11"></A><BR><BR>The first death under the new emperor, that of Junius Silanus, 
<A NAME="12"></A>proconsul of Asia, was, without Nero's knowledge, planned by the treachery 
<A NAME="13"></A>of Agrippina. Not that Silanus had provoked destruction by any violence 
<A NAME="14"></A>of temper, apathetic as he was, and so utterly despised under former despotisms, 
<A NAME="15"></A>that Caius Caesar used to call him the golden sheep. The truth was that 
<A NAME="16"></A>Agrippina, having contrived the murder of his brother Lucius Silanus, dreaded 
<A NAME="17"></A>his vengeance; for it was the incessant popular talk that preference ought 
<A NAME="18"></A>to be given over Nero, who was scarcely out of his boyhood and had gained 
<A NAME="19"></A>the empire by crime, to a man of mature age, of blameless life, of noble 
<A NAME="20"></A>birth, and, as a point then much regarded, of the line of the Caesars. 
<A NAME="21"></A>Silanus in fact was the son of a great-grandson of Augustus. This was the 
<A NAME="22"></A>cause of his destruction. The agents of the deed were Publius Celer, a 
<A NAME="23"></A>Roman knight, and Helius, a freedman, men who had the charge of the emperor's 
<A NAME="24"></A>domains in Asia. They gave the proconsul poison at a banquet, too openly 
<A NAME="25"></A>to escape discovery.
<A NAME="26"></A><BR><BR>With no less precipitation, Narcissus, Claudius's freedman, whose 
<A NAME="27"></A>quarrels with Agrippina I have mentioned, was driven to suicide by his 
<A NAME="28"></A>cruel imprisonment and hopeless plight, even against the wishes of Nero, 
<A NAME="29"></A>with whose yet concealed vices he was wonderfully in sympathy from his 
<A NAME="30"></A>rapacity and extravagance.
<A NAME="31"></A><BR><BR>And now they had proceeded to further murders but for the opposition 
<A NAME="32"></A>of Afranius Burrus and Annaeus Seneca. These two men guided the emperor's 
<A NAME="33"></A>youth with an unity of purpose seldom found where authority is shared, 
<A NAME="34"></A>and though their accomplishments were wholly different, they had equal 
<A NAME="35"></A>influence. Burrus, with his soldier's discipline and severe manners, Seneca, 
<A NAME="36"></A>with lessons of eloquence and a dignified courtesy, strove alike to confine 
<A NAME="37"></A>the frailty of the prince's youth, should he loathe virtue, within allowable 
<A NAME="38"></A>indulgences. They had both alike to struggle against the domineering spirit 
<A NAME="39"></A>of Agrippina, who inflamed with all the passions of an evil ascendency 
<A NAME="40"></A>had Pallas on her side, at whose suggestion Claudius had ruined himself 
<A NAME="41"></A>by an incestuous marriage and a fatal adoption of a son. Nero's temper 
<A NAME="42"></A>however was not one to submit to slaves, and Pallas, by a surly arrogance 
<A NAME="43"></A>quite beyond a freedman, had provoked disgust. Still every honour was openly 
<A NAME="44"></A>heaped on Agrippina, and to a tribune who according to military custom 
<A NAME="45"></A>asked the watchword, Nero gave "the best of mothers." The Senate also decreed 
<A NAME="46"></A>her two lictors, with the office of priestess to Claudius, and voted to 
<A NAME="47"></A>the late emperor a censor's funeral, which was soon followed by 
<A NAME="48"></A>deification.
<A NAME="49"></A><BR><BR>On the day of the funeral the prince pronounced Claudius's panegyric, 
<A NAME="50"></A>and while he dwelt on the antiquity of his family and on the consulships 
<A NAME="51"></A>and triumphs of his ancestors, there was enthusiasm both in himself and 
<A NAME="52"></A>his audience. The praise of his graceful accomplishments, and the remark 
<A NAME="53"></A>that during his reign no disaster had befallen Rome from the foreigner, 
<A NAME="54"></A>were heard with favour. When the speaker passed on to his foresight and 
<A NAME="55"></A>wisdom, no one could refrain from laughter, though the speech, which was 
<A NAME="56"></A>composed by Seneca, exhibited much elegance, as indeed that famous man 
<A NAME="57"></A>had an attractive genius which suited the popular ear of the time. Elderly 
<A NAME="58"></A>men who amuse their leisure with comparing the past and the present, observed 
<A NAME="59"></A>that Nero was the first emperor who needed another man's eloquence. The 
<A NAME="60"></A>dictator Caesar rivalled the greatest orators, and Augustus had an easy 
<A NAME="61"></A>and fluent way of speaking, such as became a sovereign. Tiberius too thoroughly 
<A NAME="62"></A>understood the art of balancing words, and was sometimes forcible in the 
<A NAME="63"></A>expression of his thoughts, or else intentionally obscure. Even Caius Caesar's 
<A NAME="64"></A>disordered intellect did not wholly mar his faculty of speech. Nor did 
<A NAME="65"></A>Claudius, when he spoke with preparation, lack elegance. Nero from early 
<A NAME="66"></A>boyhood turned his lively genius in other directions; he carved, painted, 
<A NAME="67"></A>sang, or practised the management of horses, occasionally composing verses 
<A NAME="68"></A>which showed that he had the rudiments of learning.
<A NAME="69"></A><BR><BR>When he had done with his mimicries of sorrow he entered the Senate, 
<A NAME="70"></A>and having first referred to the authority of the senators and the concurrence 
<A NAME="71"></A>of the soldiery, he then dwelt on the counsels and examples which he had 
<A NAME="72"></A>to guide him in the right administration of empire. "His boyhood," he said, 
<A NAME="73"></A>"had not had the taint of civil wars or domestic feuds, and he brought 
<A NAME="74"></A>with him no hatreds, no sense of wrong, no desire of vengeance." He then 
<A NAME="75"></A>sketched the plan of his future government, carefully avoiding anything 
<A NAME="76"></A>which had kindled recent odium. "He would not," he said, "be judge in all 
<A NAME="77"></A>cases, or, by confining the accuser and the accused within the same walls, 
<A NAME="78"></A>let the power of a few favourites grow dangerously formidable. In his house 
<A NAME="79"></A>there should be nothing venal, nothing open to intrigue; his private establishment 
<A NAME="80"></A>and the State should be kept entirely distinct. The Senate should retain 
<A NAME="81"></A>its ancient powers; Italy and the State-provinces should plead their causes 
<A NAME="82"></A>before the tribunals of the consuls, who would give them a hearing from 
<A NAME="83"></A>the senators. Of the armies he would himself take charge, as specially 
<A NAME="84"></A>entrusted to him."
<A NAME="85"></A><BR><BR>He was true to his word and several arrangements were made on the 
<A NAME="86"></A>Senate's authority. No one was to receive a fee or a present for pleading 
<A NAME="87"></A>a cause; the quaestors-elect were not to be under the necessity of exhibiting 
<A NAME="88"></A>gladiatorial shows. This was opposed by Agrippina, as a reversal of the 
<A NAME="89"></A>legislation of Claudius, but it was carried by the senators who used to 
<A NAME="90"></A>be summoned to the palace, in order that she might stand close to a hidden 
<A NAME="91"></A>door behind them, screened by a curtain which was enough to shut her out 
<A NAME="92"></A>of sight, but not out of hearing. When envoys from Armenia were pleading 
<A NAME="93"></A>their nation's cause before Nero, she actually was on the point of mounting 
<A NAME="94"></A>the emperor's tribunal and of presiding with him; but Seneca, when every 
<A NAME="95"></A>one else was paralysed with alarm, motioned to the prince to go and meet 
<A NAME="96"></A>his mother. Thus, by an apparently dutiful act, a scandalous scene was 
<A NAME="97"></A>prevented.
<A NAME="98"></A><BR><BR>With the close of the year came disquieting rumours that the Parthians 
<A NAME="99"></A>had again broken their bounds and were ravaging Armenia, from which they 
<A NAME="100"></A>had driven Rhadamistus, who, having often possessed himself of the kingdom 
<A NAME="101"></A>and as often been thrust out of it, had now relinquished hostilities. Rome 
<A NAME="102"></A>with its love of talking began to ask how a prince of scarce seventeen 
<A NAME="103"></A>was to encounter and avert this tremendous peril, how they could fall back 
<A NAME="104"></A>on one who was ruled by a woman; or whether battles and sieges and the 
<A NAME="105"></A>other operations of war could be directed by tutors. "Some, on the contrary, 
<A NAME="106"></A>argued that this was better than it would have been, had Claudius in his 
<A NAME="107"></A>feeble and spiritless old age, when he would certainly have yielded to 
<A NAME="108"></A>the bidding of slaves, been summoned to the hardships of a campaign. Burrus, 
<A NAME="109"></A>at least, and Seneca were known to be men of very varied experience, and, 
<A NAME="110"></A>as for the emperor himself, how far was he really short of mature age, 
<A NAME="111"></A>when Cneius Pompeius and Caesar Octavianus, in their eighteenth and nineteenth 
<A NAME="112"></A>years respectively, bore the brunt of civil wars? The highest rank chiefly 
<A NAME="113"></A>worked through its prestige and its counsels more than by the sword and 
<A NAME="114"></A>hand. The emperor would give a plain proof whether he was advised by good 
<A NAME="115"></A>or bad friends by putting aside all jealousy and selecting some eminent 
<A NAME="116"></A>general, rather than by promoting out of favouritism, a rich man backed 
<A NAME="117"></A>up by interest."
<A NAME="118"></A><BR><BR>Amidst this and like popular talk, Nero ordered the young recruits 
<A NAME="119"></A>levied in the adjacent provinces to be brought up for the supply of the 
<A NAME="120"></A>legions of the East, and the legions themselves to take up a position on 
<A NAME="121"></A>the Armenian frontier while two princes of old standing, Agrippa and Antiochus, 
<A NAME="122"></A>were to prepare a force for the invasion of the Parthian territories. The 
<A NAME="123"></A>Euphrates too was to be spanned by bridges; Lesser Armenia was intrusted 
<A NAME="124"></A>to Aristobulus, Sophene to Sohaemus, each with the ensigns of royalty. 
<A NAME="125"></A>There rose up at this crisis a rival to Vologeses in his son Vardanes, 
<A NAME="126"></A>and the Parthians quitted Armenia, apparently intending to defer 
<A NAME="127"></A>hostilities.
<A NAME="128"></A><BR><BR>All this however was described with exaggeration to the Senate, 
<A NAME="129"></A>in the speeches of those members who proposed a public thanksgiving, and 
<A NAME="130"></A>that on the days of the thanksgiving the prince should wear the triumphal 
<A NAME="131"></A>robe and enter Rome in ovation, lastly, that he should have statues on 
<A NAME="132"></A>the same scale as those of Mars the Avenger, and in the same temple. To 
<A NAME="133"></A>their habitual flattery was added a real joy at his having appointed Domitius 
<A NAME="134"></A>Corbulo to secure Armenia, thus opening, as it seemed, a field to merit. 
<A NAME="135"></A>The armies of the East were so divided that half the auxiliaries and two 
<A NAME="136"></A>legions were to remain in the province of Syria under its governor, Quadratus 
<A NAME="137"></A>Ummidius; while Corbulo was to have an equal number of citizen and allied 
<A NAME="138"></A>troops, together with the auxiliary infantry and cavalry which were in 
<A NAME="139"></A>winter quarters in Cappadocia. The confederate kings were instructed to 
<A NAME="140"></A>obey orders, just as the war might require. But they had a specially strong 
<A NAME="141"></A>liking for Corbulo. That general, with a view to the prestige which in 
<A NAME="142"></A>a new enterprise is supremely powerful, speedily accomplished his march, 
<A NAME="143"></A>and at Aegeae, a city of Cilicia, met Quadratus who had advanced to the 
<A NAME="144"></A>place under an apprehension that, should Corbulo once enter Armenia to 
<A NAME="145"></A>take command of the army, he would draw all eyes on himself, by his noble 
<A NAME="146"></A>stature, his imposing eloquence, and the impression he would make, not 
<A NAME="147"></A>only by his wisdom and experience, but also by the mere display of showy 
<A NAME="148"></A>attributes.
<A NAME="149"></A><BR><BR>Meantime both sent messages to king Vologeses, advising him to 
<A NAME="150"></A>choose peace rather than war, and to give hostages and so continue the 
<A NAME="151"></A>habitual reverence of his ancestors towards the people of Rome. Vologeses, 
<A NAME="152"></A>wishing to prepare for war at an advantage, or to rid himself of suspected 
<A NAME="153"></A>rivals under the name of hostages, delivered up some of the noblest of 
<A NAME="154"></A>the Arsacids. A centurion, Insteius, sent perhaps by Ummidius on some previous 
<A NAME="155"></A>occasion, received them after an interview with the king. Corbulo, on knowing 
<A NAME="156"></A>this, ordered Arrius Varus, commander of a cohort, to go and take the hostages. 
<A NAME="157"></A>Hence arose a quarrel between the commander and the centurion, and to stop 
<A NAME="158"></A>such a scene before foreigners, the decision of the matter was left to 
<A NAME="159"></A>the hostages and to the envoys who conducted them. They preferred Corbulo, 
<A NAME="160"></A>for his recent renown, and from a liking which even enemies felt for him. 
<A NAME="161"></A>Then there was a feud between the two generals; Ummidius complained that 
<A NAME="162"></A>he was robbed of what his prudence had achieved, while Corbulo on the other 
<A NAME="163"></A>hand appealed to the fact that Vologeses had not brought himself to offer 
<A NAME="164"></A>hostages till his own appointment to the conduct of the war turned the 
<A NAME="165"></A>king's hopes into fears. Nero, to compose their differences, directed the 
<A NAME="166"></A>issue of a proclamation that for the successes of Quadratus and Corbulo 
<A NAME="167"></A>the laurel was to be added to the imperial "fasces." I have closely connected 
<A NAME="168"></A>these events, though they extend into another consulship.
<A NAME="169"></A><BR><BR>The emperor in the same year asked the Senate for a statue to his 
<A NAME="170"></A>father Domitius, and also that the consular decorations might be conferred 
<A NAME="171"></A>on Asconius Labeo, who had been his guardian. Statues to himself of solid 
<A NAME="172"></A>gold and silver he forbade, in opposition to offers made, and although 
<A NAME="173"></A>the Senate passed a vote that the year should begin with the month of December, 
<A NAME="174"></A>in which he was born, he retained for its commencement, the old sacred 
<A NAME="175"></A>associations of the first of January. Nor would he allow the prosecution 
<A NAME="176"></A>of Carinas Celer, a senator, whom a slave accused, or of Julius Densus, 
<A NAME="177"></A>a knight, whose partiality for Britannicus was construed into a 
<A NAME="178"></A>crime.
<A NAME="179"></A><BR><BR>In the year of his consulship with Lucius Antistius, when the magistrates 
<A NAME="180"></A>were swearing obedience to imperial legislation, he forbade his colleague 
<A NAME="181"></A>to extend the oath to his own enactments, for which he was warmly praised 
<A NAME="182"></A>by the senators, in the hope that his youthful spirit, elated with the 
<A NAME="183"></A>glory won by trifles, would follow on to nobler aspirations. Then came 
<A NAME="184"></A>an act of mercy to Plautius Lateranus, who had been degraded from his rank 
<A NAME="185"></A>for adultery with Messalina, and whom he now restored, assuring them of 
<A NAME="186"></A>his clemency in a number of speeches which Seneca, to show the purity of 
<A NAME="187"></A>his teaching or to display his genius, published to the world by the emperor's 
<A NAME="188"></A>mouth.
<A NAME="189"></A><BR><BR>Meanwhile the mother's influence was gradually weakened, as Nero 
<A NAME="190"></A>fell in love with a freedwoman, Acte by name, and took into his confidence 
<A NAME="191"></A>Otho and Claudius Senecio, two young men of fashion, the first of whom 
<A NAME="192"></A>was descended from a family of consular rank, while Senecio's father was 
<A NAME="193"></A>one of the emperor's freedmen. Without the mother's knowledge, then in 
<A NAME="194"></A>spite of her opposition, they had crept into his favour by debaucheries 
<A NAME="195"></A>and equivocal secrets, and even the prince's older friends did not thwart 
<A NAME="196"></A>him, for here was a girl who without harm to any one gratified his desires, 
<A NAME="197"></A>when he loathed his wife Octavia, high born as she was, and of approved 
<A NAME="198"></A>virtue, either from some fatality, or because vice is overpoweringly attractive. 
<A NAME="199"></A>It was feared too that he might rush into outrages on noble ladies, were 
<A NAME="200"></A>he debarred from this indulgence.
<A NAME="201"></A><BR><BR>Agrippina, however, raved with a woman's fury about having a freedwoman 
<A NAME="202"></A>for a rival, a slave girl for a daughter-in-law, with like expressions. 
<A NAME="203"></A>Nor would she wait till her son repented or wearied of his passion. The 
<A NAME="204"></A>fouler her reproaches, the more powerfully did they inflame him, till completely 
<A NAME="205"></A>mastered by the strength of his desire, he threw off all respect for his 
<A NAME="206"></A>mother, and put himself under the guidance of Seneca, one of whose friends, 
<A NAME="207"></A>Annaeus Serenus, had veiled the young prince's intrigue in its beginning 
<A NAME="208"></A>by pretending to be in love with the same woman, and had lent his name 
<A NAME="209"></A>as the ostensible giver of the presents secretly sent by the emperor to 
<A NAME="210"></A>the girl. Then Agrippina, changing her tactics, plied the lad with various 
<A NAME="211"></A>blandishments, and even offered the seclusion of her chamber for the concealment 
<A NAME="212"></A>of indulgences which youth and the highest rank might claim. She went further; 
<A NAME="213"></A>she pleaded guilty to an ill-timed strictness, and handed over to him the 
<A NAME="214"></A>abundance of her wealth, which nearly approached the imperial treasures, 
<A NAME="215"></A>and from having been of late extreme in her restraint of her son, became 
<A NAME="216"></A>now, on the other hand, lax to excess. The change did not escape Nero; 
<A NAME="217"></A>his most intimate friends dreaded it, and begged him to beware of the arts 
<A NAME="218"></A>of a woman, was always daring and was now false.
<A NAME="219"></A><BR><BR>It happened at this time that the emperor after inspecting the 
<A NAME="220"></A>apparel in which wives and mothers of the imperial house had been seen 
<A NAME="221"></A>to glitter, selected a jewelled robe and sent it as a gift to his mother, 
<A NAME="222"></A>with the unsparing liberality of one who was bestowing by preference on 
<A NAME="223"></A>her a choice and much coveted present. Agrippina, however, publicly declared 
<A NAME="224"></A>that so far from her wardrobe being furnished by these gifts, she was really 
<A NAME="225"></A>kept out of the remainder, and that her son was merely dividing with her 
<A NAME="226"></A>what he derived wholly from herself.
<A NAME="227"></A><BR><BR>Some there were who put even a worse meaning on her words. And 
<A NAME="228"></A>so Nero, furious with those who abetted such arrogance in a woman, removed 
<A NAME="229"></A>Pallas from the charge of the business with which he had been entrusted 
<A NAME="230"></A>by Claudius, and in which he acted, so to say, as the controller of the 
<A NAME="231"></A>throne. The story went that as he was departing with a great retinue of 
<A NAME="232"></A>attendants, the emperor rather wittily remarked that Pallas was going to 
<A NAME="233"></A>swear himself out of office. Pallas had in truth stipulated that he should 
<A NAME="234"></A>not be questioned for anything he had done in the past, and that his accounts 
<A NAME="235"></A>with the State were to be considered as balanced. Thereupon, with instant 
<A NAME="236"></A>fury, Agrippina rushed into frightful menaces, sparing not the prince's 
<A NAME="237"></A>ears her solemn protest "that Britannicus was now of full age, he who was 
<A NAME="238"></A>the true and worthy heir of his father's sovereignty, which a son, by mere 
<A NAME="239"></A>admission and adoption, was abusing in outrages on his mother. She shrank 
<A NAME="240"></A>not from an utter exposure of the wickedness of that ill-starred house, 
<A NAME="241"></A>of her own marriage, to begin with, and of her poisoner's craft. All that 
<A NAME="242"></A>the gods and she herself had taken care of was that her stepson was yet 
<A NAME="243"></A>alive; with him she would go to the camp, where on one side should be heard 
<A NAME="244"></A>the daughter of Germanicus; on the other, the crippled Burrus and the exile 
<A NAME="245"></A>Seneca, claiming, forsooth, with disfigured hand, and a pedant's tongue, 
<A NAME="246"></A>the government of the world." As she spoke, she raised her hand in menace 
<A NAME="247"></A>and heaped insults on him, as she appealed to the deified Claudius, to 
<A NAME="248"></A>the infernal shades of the Silani, and to those many fruitless 
<A NAME="249"></A>crimes.
<A NAME="250"></A><BR><BR>Nero was confounded at this, and as the day was near on which Britannicus 
<A NAME="251"></A>would complete his fourteenth year, he reflected, now on the domineering 
<A NAME="252"></A>temper of his mother, and now again on the character of the young prince, 
<A NAME="253"></A>which a trifling circumstance had lately tested, sufficient however to 
<A NAME="254"></A>gain for him wide popularity. During the feast of Saturn, amid other pastimes 
<A NAME="255"></A>of his playmates, at a game of lot drawing for king, the lot fell to Nero, 
<A NAME="256"></A>upon which he gave all his other companions different orders, and such 
<A NAME="257"></A>as would not put them to the blush; but when he told Britannicus to step 
<A NAME="258"></A>forward and begin a song, hoping for a laugh at the expense of a boy who 
<A NAME="259"></A>knew nothing of sober, much less of riotous society, the lad with perfect 
<A NAME="260"></A>coolness commenced some verses which hinted at his expulsion from his father's 
<A NAME="261"></A>house and from supreme power. This procured him pity, which was the more 
<A NAME="262"></A>conspicuous, as night with its merriment had stript off all disguise. Nero 
<A NAME="263"></A>saw the reproach and redoubled his hate. Pressed by Agrippina's menaces, 
<A NAME="264"></A>having no charge against his brother and not daring openly to order his 
<A NAME="265"></A>murder, he meditated a secret device and directed poison to be prepared 
<A NAME="266"></A>through the agency of Julius Pollio, tribune of one of the praetorian cohorts, 
<A NAME="267"></A>who had in his custody a woman under sentence for poisoning, Locusta by 
<A NAME="268"></A>name, with a vast reputation for crime. That every one about the person 
<A NAME="269"></A>of Britannicus should care nothing for right or honour, had long ago been 
<A NAME="270"></A>provided for. He actually received his first dose of poison from his tutors 
<A NAME="271"></A>and passed it off his bowels, as it was rather weak or so qualified as 
<A NAME="272"></A>not at once to prove deadly. But Nero, impatient at such slow progress 
<A NAME="273"></A>in crime, threatened the tribune and ordered the poisoner to execution 
<A NAME="274"></A>for prolonging his anxiety while they were thinking of the popular talk 
<A NAME="275"></A>and planning their own defence. Then they promised that death should be 
<A NAME="276"></A>as sudden as if it were the hurried work of the dagger, and a rapid poison 
<A NAME="277"></A>of previously tested ingredients was prepared close to the emperor's 
<A NAME="278"></A>chamber.
<A NAME="279"></A><BR><BR>It was customary for the imperial princes to sit during their meals 
<A NAME="280"></A>with other nobles of the same age, in the sight of their kinsfolk, at a 
<A NAME="281"></A>table of their own, furnished somewhat frugally. There Britannicus was 
<A NAME="282"></A>dining, and as what he ate and drank was always tested by the taste of 
<A NAME="283"></A>a select attendant, the following device was contrived, that the usage 
<A NAME="284"></A>might not be dropped or the crime betrayed by the death of both prince 
<A NAME="285"></A>and attendant. A cup as yet harmless, but extremely hot and already tasted, 
<A NAME="286"></A>was handed to Britannicus; then, on his refusing it because of its warmth, 
<A NAME="287"></A>poison was poured in with some cold water, and this so penetrated his entire 
<A NAME="288"></A>frame that he lost alike voice and breath. There was a stir among the company; 
<A NAME="289"></A>some, taken by surprise, ran hither and thither, while those whose discernment 
<A NAME="290"></A>was keener, remained motionless, with their eyes fixed on Nero, who, as 
<A NAME="291"></A>he still reclined in seeming unconsciousness, said that this was a common 
<A NAME="292"></A>occurrence, from a periodical epilepsy, with which Britannicus had been 
<A NAME="293"></A>afflicted from his earliest infancy, and that his sight and senses would 
<A NAME="294"></A>gradually return. As for Agrippina, her terror and confusion, though her 
<A NAME="295"></A>countenance struggled to hide it, so visibly appeared, that she was clearly 
<A NAME="296"></A>just as ignorant as was Octavia, Britannicus's own sister. She saw, in 
<A NAME="297"></A>fact, that she was robbed of her only remaining refuge, and that here was 
<A NAME="298"></A>a precedent for parricide. Even Octavia, notwithstanding her youthful inexperience, 
<A NAME="299"></A>had learnt to hide her grief, her affection, and indeed every 
<A NAME="300"></A>emotion.
<A NAME="301"></A><BR><BR>And so after a brief pause the company resumed its mirth. One and 
<A NAME="302"></A>the same night witnessed Britannicus's death and funeral, preparations 
<A NAME="303"></A>having been already made for his obsequies, which were on a humble scale. 
<A NAME="304"></A>He was however buried in the Campus Martius, amid storms so violent, that 
<A NAME="305"></A>in the popular belief they portended the wrath of heaven against a crime 
<A NAME="306"></A>which many were even inclined to forgive when they remembered the immemorial 
<A NAME="307"></A>feuds of brothers and the impossibility of a divided throne. It is related 
<A NAME="308"></A>by several writers of the period that many days before the murder, Nero 
<A NAME="309"></A>had offered the worst insult to the boyhood of Britannicus; so that his 
<A NAME="310"></A>death could no longer seem a premature or dreadful event, though it happened 
<A NAME="311"></A>at the sacred board, without even a moment for the embraces of his sisters, 
<A NAME="312"></A>hurried on too, as it was, under the eyes of an enemy, on the sole surviving 
<A NAME="313"></A>offspring of the Claudii, the victim first of dishonour, then of poison. 
<A NAME="314"></A>The emperor apologised for the hasty funeral by reminding people that it 
<A NAME="315"></A>was the practice of our ancestors to withdraw from view any grievously 
<A NAME="316"></A>untimely death, and not to dwell on it with panegyrics or display. For 
<A NAME="317"></A>himself, he said, that as he had now lost a brother's help, his remaining 
<A NAME="318"></A>hopes centred in the State, and all the more tenderness ought to be shown 
<A NAME="319"></A>by the Senate and people towards a prince who was the only survivor of 
<A NAME="320"></A>a family born to the highest greatness.
<A NAME="321"></A><BR><BR>He then enriched his most powerful friends with liberal presents. 
<A NAME="322"></A>Some there were who reproached men of austere professions with having on 
<A NAME="323"></A>such an occasion divided houses and estates among themselves, like so much 
<A NAME="324"></A>spoil. It was the belief of others that a pressure had been put on them 
<A NAME="325"></A>by the emperor, who, conscious as he was of guilt, hoped for merciful consideration 
<A NAME="326"></A>if he could secure the most important men by wholesale bribery. But his 
<A NAME="327"></A>mother's rage no lavish bounty could allay. She would clasp Octavia to 
<A NAME="328"></A>her arms, and have many a secret interview with her friends; with more 
<A NAME="329"></A>than her natural rapacity, she clutched at money everywhere, seemingly 
<A NAME="330"></A>for a reserve, and courteously received tribunes and centurions. She honoured 
<A NAME="331"></A>the names and virtues of the nobles who still were left, seeking apparently 
<A NAME="332"></A>a party and a leader. Of this Nero became aware, and he ordered the departure 
<A NAME="333"></A>of the military guard now kept for the emperor's mother, as it had formerly 
<A NAME="334"></A>been for the imperial consort, along with some German troops, added as 
<A NAME="335"></A>a further honour. He also gave her a separate establishment, that throngs 
<A NAME="336"></A>of visitors might no longer wait on her, and removed her to what had been 
<A NAME="337"></A>Antonia's house; and whenever he went there himself, he was surrounded 
<A NAME="338"></A>by a crowd of centurions, and used to leave her after a hurried 
<A NAME="339"></A>kiss.
<A NAME="340"></A><BR><BR>Of all things human the most precarious and transitory is a reputation 
<A NAME="341"></A>for power which has no strong support of its own. In a moment Agrippina's 
<A NAME="342"></A>doors were deserted; there was no one to comfort or to go near her, except 
<A NAME="343"></A>a few ladies, whether out of love or malice was doubtful. One of these 
<A NAME="344"></A>was Junia Silana, whom Messalina had driven from her husband, Caius Silius, 
<A NAME="345"></A>as I have already related. Conspicuous for her birth, her beauty, and her 
<A NAME="346"></A>wantonness, she had long been a special favourite of Agrippina, till after 
<A NAME="347"></A>a while there were secret mutual dislikes, because Sextius Africanus, a 
<A NAME="348"></A>noble youth, had been deterred from marrying Silana by Agrippina, who repeatedly 
<A NAME="349"></A>spoke of her as an immodest woman in the decline of life, not to secure 
<A NAME="350"></A>Africanus for herself, but to keep the childless and wealthy widow out 
<A NAME="351"></A>of a husband's control. Silana having now a prospect of vengeance, suborned 
<A NAME="352"></A>as accusers two of her creatures, Iturius and Calvisius, not with the old 
<A NAME="353"></A>and often-repeated charges about Agrippina's mourning the death of Britannicus 
<A NAME="354"></A>or publishing the wrongs of Octavia, but with a hint that it was her purpose 
<A NAME="355"></A>to encourage in revolutionary designs Rubellius Plautus, who his mother's 
<A NAME="356"></A>side was as nearly connected as Nero with the Divine Augustus; and then, 
<A NAME="357"></A>by marrying him and making him emperor, again seize the control of the 
<A NAME="358"></A>State. All this Iturius and Calvisius divulged to Atimetus, a freedman 
<A NAME="359"></A>of Domitia, Nero's aunt. Exulting in the opportunity, for Agrippina and 
<A NAME="360"></A>Domitia were in bitter rivalry, Atimetus urged Paris, who was himself also 
<A NAME="361"></A>a freedman of Domitia, to go at once and put the charge in the most dreadful 
<A NAME="362"></A>form.
<A NAME="363"></A><BR><BR>Night was far advanced and Nero was still sitting over his cups, 
<A NAME="364"></A>when Paris entered, who was generally wont at such times to heighten the 
<A NAME="365"></A>emperor's enjoyments, but who now wore a gloomy expression. He went through 
<A NAME="366"></A>the whole evidence in order, and so frightened his hearer as to make him 
<A NAME="367"></A>resolve not only on the destruction of his mother and of Plautus, but also 
<A NAME="368"></A>on the removal of Burrus from the command of the guards, as a man who had 
<A NAME="369"></A>been promoted by Agrippina's interest, and was now showing his gratitude. 
<A NAME="370"></A>We have it on the authority of Fabius Rusticus that a note was written 
<A NAME="371"></A>to Caecina Tuscus, intrusting to him the charge of the praetorian cohorts, 
<A NAME="372"></A>but that through Seneca's influence that distinguished post was retained 
<A NAME="373"></A>for Burrus. According to Plinius and Cluvius, no doubt was felt about the 
<A NAME="374"></A>commander's loyalty. Fabius certainly inclines to the praise of Seneca, 
<A NAME="375"></A>through whose friendship he rose to honour. Proposing as I do to follow 
<A NAME="376"></A>the consentient testimony of historians, I shall give the differences in 
<A NAME="377"></A>their narratives under the writers' names. Nero, in his bewilderment and 
<A NAME="378"></A>impatience to destroy his mother, could not be put off till Burrus answered 
<A NAME="379"></A>for her death, should she be convicted of the crime, but "any one," he 
<A NAME="380"></A>said, "much more a parent, must be allowed a defence. Accusers there were 
<A NAME="381"></A>none forthcoming; they had before them only the word of a single person 
<A NAME="382"></A>from an enemy's house, and this the night with its darkness and prolonged 
<A NAME="383"></A>festivity and everything savouring of recklessness and folly, was enough 
<A NAME="384"></A>to refute."
<A NAME="385"></A><BR><BR>Having thus allayed the prince's fears, they went at daybreak to 
<A NAME="386"></A>Agrippina, that she might know the charges against her, and either rebut 
<A NAME="387"></A>them or suffer the penalty. Burrus fulfilled his instructions in Seneca's 
<A NAME="388"></A>presence, and some of the freedmen were present to witness the interview. 
<A NAME="389"></A>Then Burrus, when he had fully explained the charges with the authors' 
<A NAME="390"></A>names, assumed an air of menace. Instantly Agrippina, calling up all her 
<A NAME="391"></A>high spirit, exclaimed, "I wonder not that Silana, who has never borne 
<A NAME="392"></A>offspring, knows nothing of a mother's feelings.
<A NAME="393"></A><BR><BR>Parents do not change their children as lightly as a shameless 
<A NAME="394"></A>woman does her paramours. And if Iturius and Calvisius, after having wasted 
<A NAME="395"></A>their whole fortunes, are now, as their last resource, repaying an old 
<A NAME="396"></A>hag for their hire by undertaking to be informers, it does not follow that 
<A NAME="397"></A>I am to incur the infamy of plotting a son's murder, or that a Caesar is 
<A NAME="398"></A>to have the consciousness of like guilt. As for Domitia's enmity, I should 
<A NAME="399"></A>be thankful for it, were she to vie with me in goodwill towards my Nero. 
<A NAME="400"></A>Now through her paramour, Atimetus, and the actor, Paris, she is, so to 
<A NAME="401"></A>say, concocting a drama for the stage. She at her Baiae was increasing 
<A NAME="402"></A>the magnificence of her fishponds, when I was planning in my counsels his 
<A NAME="403"></A>adoption with a proconsul's powers and a consul-elect's rank and every 
<A NAME="404"></A>other step to empire. Only let the man come forward who can charge me with 
<A NAME="405"></A>having tampered with the praetorian cohorts in the capital, with having 
<A NAME="406"></A>sapped the loyalty of the provinces, or, in a word, with having bribed 
<A NAME="407"></A>slaves and freedmen into any wickedness. Could I have lived with Britannicus 
<A NAME="408"></A>in the possession of power? And if Plautus or any other were to become 
<A NAME="409"></A>master of the State so as to sit in judgment on me, accusers forsooth would 
<A NAME="410"></A>not be forthcoming, to charge me not merely with a few incautious expressions 
<A NAME="411"></A>prompted by the eagerness of affection, but with guilt from which a son 
<A NAME="412"></A>alone could absolve me."
<A NAME="413"></A><BR><BR>There was profound excitement among those present, and they even 
<A NAME="414"></A>tried to soothe her agitation, but she insisted on an interview with her 
<A NAME="415"></A>son. Then, instead of pleading her innocence, as though she lacked confidence, 
<A NAME="416"></A>or her claims on him by way of reproach, she obtained vengeance on her 
<A NAME="417"></A>accusers and rewards for her friends.
<A NAME="418"></A><BR><BR>The superintendence of the corn supply was given to Faenius Rufus, 
<A NAME="419"></A>the direction of the games which the emperor was preparing, to Arruntius 
<A NAME="420"></A>Stella, and the province of Egypt to Caius Balbillus. Syria was to be assigned 
<A NAME="421"></A>to Publius Anteius, but he was soon put off by various artifices and finally 
<A NAME="422"></A>detained at Rome. Silana was banished; Calvisius and Iturius exiled for 
<A NAME="423"></A>a time; Atimetus was capitally punished, while Paris was too serviceable 
<A NAME="424"></A>to the emperor's profligacy to allow of his suffering any penalty. Plautus 
<A NAME="425"></A>for the present was silently passed over.
<A NAME="426"></A><BR><BR>Next Pallas and Burrus were accused of having conspired to raise 
<A NAME="427"></A>Cornelius Sulla to the throne, because of his noble birth and connection 
<A NAME="428"></A>with Claudius, whose son-in-law he was by his marriage with Antonia. The 
<A NAME="429"></A>promoter of the prosecution was one Paetus, who had become notorious by 
<A NAME="430"></A>frequent purchases of property confiscated to the exchequer and was now 
<A NAME="431"></A>convicted clearly of imposture. But the proved innocence of Pallas did 
<A NAME="432"></A>Pallas did not please men so much, as his arrogance offended them. When 
<A NAME="433"></A>his freedmen, his alleged accomplices, were called, he replied that at 
<A NAME="434"></A>home he signified his wishes only by a nod or a gesture, or, if further 
<A NAME="435"></A>explanation was required, he used writing, so as not to degrade his voice 
<A NAME="436"></A>in such company. Burrus, though accused, gave his verdict as one of the 
<A NAME="437"></A>judges. The prosecutor was sentenced to exile, and the account-books in 
<A NAME="438"></A>which he was reviving forgotten claims of the exchequer, were 
<A NAME="439"></A>burnt.
<A NAME="440"></A><BR><BR>At the end of the year the cohort usually on guard during the games 
<A NAME="441"></A>was withdrawn, that there might be a greater show of freedom, that the 
<A NAME="442"></A>soldiery too might be less demoralised when no longer in contact with the 
<A NAME="443"></A>licence of the theatre, and that it might be proved whether the populace, 
<A NAME="444"></A>in the absence of a guard, would maintain their self-control. The emperor, 
<A NAME="445"></A>on the advice of the augurs, purified Rome by a lustration, as the temples 
<A NAME="446"></A>of Jupiter and Minerva had been struck by lightning.
<A NAME="447"></A><BR><BR>In the consulship of Quintus Volusius and Publius Scipio, there 
<A NAME="448"></A>was peace abroad, but a disgusting licentiousness at home on the part of 
<A NAME="449"></A>Nero, who in a slave's disguise, so as to be unrecognized, would wander 
<A NAME="450"></A>through the streets of Rome, to brothels and taverns, with comrades, who 
<A NAME="451"></A>seized on goods exposed for sale and inflicted wounds on any whom they 
<A NAME="452"></A>encountered, some of these last knowing him so little that he even received 
<A NAME="453"></A>blows himself, and showed the marks of them in his face. When it was notorious 
<A NAME="454"></A>that the emperor was the assailant, and the insults on men and women of 
<A NAME="455"></A>distinction were multiplied, other persons too on the strength of a licence 
<A NAME="456"></A>once granted under Nero's name, ventured with impunity on the same practices, 
<A NAME="457"></A>and had gangs of their own, till night presented the scenes of a captured 
<A NAME="458"></A>city. Julius Montanus, a senator, but one who had not yet held any office, 
<A NAME="459"></A>happened to encounter the prince in the darkness, and because he fiercely 
<A NAME="460"></A>repulsed his attack and then on recognizing him begged for mercy, as though 
<A NAME="461"></A>this was a reproach, forced to destroy himself. Nero was for the future 
<A NAME="462"></A>more timid, and surrounded himself with soldiers and a number of gladiators, 
<A NAME="463"></A>who, when a fray began on a small scale and seemed a private affair, were 
<A NAME="464"></A>to let it alone, but, if the injured persons resisted stoutly, they rushed 
<A NAME="465"></A>in with their swords. He also turned the licence of the games and the enthusiasm 
<A NAME="466"></A>for the actors into something like a battle by the impunity he allowed, 
<A NAME="467"></A>and the rewards he offered, and especially by looking on himself, sometimes 
<A NAME="468"></A>concealed, but often in public view, till, with the people at strife and 
<A NAME="469"></A>the fear of a worse commotion, the only remedy which could be devised was 
<A NAME="470"></A>the expulsion of the offending actors from Italy, and the presence once 
<A NAME="471"></A>more of the soldiery in the theatre.
<A NAME="472"></A><BR><BR>During the same time there was a discussion in the Senate on the 
<A NAME="473"></A>misconduct of the freedmen class, and a strong demand was made that, as 
<A NAME="474"></A>a check on the undeserving, patrons should have the right of revoking freedom. 
<A NAME="475"></A>There were several who supported this. But the consuls did not venture 
<A NAME="476"></A>to put the motion without the emperor's knowledge, though they recorded 
<A NAME="477"></A>the Senate's general opinion, to see whether he would sanction the arrangement, 
<A NAME="478"></A>considering that only a few were opposed to it, while some loudly complained 
<A NAME="479"></A>that the irreverent spirit which freedom had fostered, had broken into 
<A NAME="480"></A>such excess, that freedmen would ask their patrons' advice as to whether 
<A NAME="481"></A>they should treat them with violence, or, as legally, their equals, and 
<A NAME="482"></A>would actually threaten them with blows, at the same time recommending 
<A NAME="483"></A>them not to punish. "What right," it was asked, "was conceded to an injured 
<A NAME="484"></A>patron but that of temporarily banishing the freedman a hundred miles off 
<A NAME="485"></A>to the shores of Campania? In everything else, legal proceedings were equal 
<A NAME="486"></A>and the same for both. Some weapon ought to be given to the patrons which 
<A NAME="487"></A>could not be despised. It would be no grievance for the enfranchised to 
<A NAME="488"></A>have to keep their freedom by the same respectful behaviour which had procured 
<A NAME="489"></A>it for them. But, as for notorious offenders, they deserved to be dragged 
<A NAME="490"></A>back into slavery, that fear might be a restraint where kindness had had 
<A NAME="491"></A>no effect."
<A NAME="492"></A><BR><BR>It was argued in reply that, though the guilt of a few ought to 
<A NAME="493"></A>be the ruin of the men themselves, there should be no diminution of the 
<A NAME="494"></A>rights of the entire class. "For it was," they contended, "a widely diffused 
<A NAME="495"></A>body; from it, the city tribes, the various public functionaries, the establishments 
<A NAME="496"></A>of the magistrates and priests were for the most part supplied, as well 
<A NAME="497"></A>as the cohorts of the city-guard; very many too of the knights and several 
<A NAME="498"></A>of the senators derived their origin from no other source. If freedmen 
<A NAME="499"></A>were to be a separate class, the paucity of the freeborn would be conspicuously 
<A NAME="500"></A>apparent. Not without good reason had our ancestors, in distinguishing 
<A NAME="501"></A>the position of the different orders, thrown freedom open to all. Again, 
<A NAME="502"></A>two kinds of enfranchisement had been instituted, so as to leave room for 
<A NAME="503"></A>retracting the boon, or for a fresh act of grace. Those whom the patron 
<A NAME="504"></A>had not emancipated with the freedom-giving rod, were still held, as it 
<A NAME="505"></A>were, by the bonds of slavery. Every master should carefully consider the 
<A NAME="506"></A>merits of each case, and be slow to grant what once given could not be 
<A NAME="507"></A>taken away."
<A NAME="508"></A><BR><BR>This view prevailed, and the emperor replied to the Senate that, 
<A NAME="509"></A>whenever freedmen were accused by their patrons, they were to investigate 
<A NAME="510"></A>each case separately and not to annul any right to their common injury. 
<A NAME="511"></A>Soon afterwards, his aunt Domitia had her freedman Paris taken from her, 
<A NAME="512"></A>avowedly by civil law, much to the emperor's disgrace, by whose direction 
<A NAME="513"></A>a decision that he was freeborn was obtained.
<A NAME="514"></A><BR><BR>Still there yet remained some shadow of a free state. A contest 
<A NAME="515"></A>arose between Vibullius, the praetor, and Antistius, a tribune of the people; 
<A NAME="516"></A>for the tribune had ordered the release of some disorderly applauders of 
<A NAME="517"></A>certain actors, whom the praetor had imprisoned. The Senate approved the 
<A NAME="518"></A>imprisonment, and censured the presumption of Antistius. Tribunes were 
<A NAME="519"></A>also forbidden to usurp the authority of praetors and consuls, or to summon 
<A NAME="520"></A>from any part of Italy persons liable to legal proceedings. It was further 
<A NAME="521"></A>proposed by Lucius Piso, consul-elect, that tribunes were not to try any 
<A NAME="522"></A>case in their own houses, that a fine imposed by them was not to be entered 
<A NAME="523"></A>on the public books by the officials of the exchequer, till four months 
<A NAME="524"></A>had expired, and that in the meantime appeals were to be allowed, which 
<A NAME="525"></A>the consuls were to decide.
<A NAME="526"></A><BR><BR>Restrictions were also put on the powers of the aediles and a limit 
<A NAME="527"></A>fixed to the amount of bail or penalty which curule and plebeian aediles 
<A NAME="528"></A>could respectively exact. On this, Helvidius Priscus, a tribune of the 
<A NAME="529"></A>people, followed up a personal quarrel he had with Obultronius Sabinus, 
<A NAME="530"></A>one of the officials of the exchequer, by insinuating that he stretched 
<A NAME="531"></A>his right of confiscation with merciless rigour against the poor. The emperor 
<A NAME="532"></A>then transferred the charge of the public accounts from these officers 
<A NAME="533"></A>to the commissioners.
<A NAME="534"></A><BR><BR>The arrangement of this business had been variously and frequently 
<A NAME="535"></A>altered. Augustus allowed the Senate to appoint commissioners; then, when 
<A NAME="536"></A>corrupt practices were suspected in the voting, men were chosen by lot 
<A NAME="537"></A>for the office out of the whole number of praetors. This did not last long, 
<A NAME="538"></A>as the lot strayed away to unfit persons. Claudius then again appointed 
<A NAME="539"></A>quaestors, and that they might not be too lax in their duties from fear 
<A NAME="540"></A>of offending, he promised them promotion out of the usual course. But what 
<A NAME="541"></A>they lacked was the firmness of mature age, entering, as they did, on this 
<A NAME="542"></A>office as their first step, and so Nero appointed ex-praetors of approved 
<A NAME="543"></A>competency.
<A NAME="544"></A><BR><BR>During the same consulship, Vipsanius Laenas was condemned for 
<A NAME="545"></A>rapacity in his administration of the province of Sardinia. Cestius Proculus 
<A NAME="546"></A>was acquitted of extortion, his accusers dropping the charge. Clodius Quirinalis, 
<A NAME="547"></A>having, when in command of the crews at Ravenna, caused grievous distress 
<A NAME="548"></A>to Italy by his profligacy and cruelty, just as if it were the most contemptible 
<A NAME="549"></A>of countries, forestalled his doom by poison. Caninius Rebilus, one of 
<A NAME="550"></A>the first men in legal knowledge and vastness of wealth, escaped the miseries 
<A NAME="551"></A>of an old age of broken health by letting the blood trickle from his veins, 
<A NAME="552"></A>though men did not credit him with sufficient resolution for a self-inflicted 
<A NAME="553"></A>death, because of his infamous effeminacy. Lucius Volusius on the other 
<A NAME="554"></A>hand died with a glorious name. There was his long life of ninety-three 
<A NAME="555"></A>years, his conspicuous wealth, honourably acquired, and his wise avoidance 
<A NAME="556"></A>of the malignity of so many emperors.
<A NAME="557"></A><BR><BR>During Nero's second consulship with Lucius Piso for his colleague, 
<A NAME="558"></A>little occurred deserving mention, unless one were to take pleasure in 
<A NAME="559"></A>filling volumes with the praise of the foundations and timber work on which 
<A NAME="560"></A>the emperor piled the immense amphitheatre in the Field of Mars. But we 
<A NAME="561"></A>have learnt that it suits the dignity of the Roman people to reserve history 
<A NAME="562"></A>for great achievements, and to leave such details to the city's daily register. 
<A NAME="563"></A>I may mention that the colonies of Nuceria and Capua were strengthened 
<A NAME="564"></A>by an addition of veterans; to every member of the city populace four hundred 
<A NAME="565"></A>sesterces were given, and forty million paid into the exchequer to maintain 
<A NAME="566"></A>the credit of the citizens.
<A NAME="567"></A><BR><BR>A tax also of four per cent. on the sale of slaves was remitted, 
<A NAME="568"></A>an apparent more than a real boon, for as the seller was ordered to pay 
<A NAME="569"></A>it, purchasers found that it was added as part of the price. The emperor 
<A NAME="570"></A>by an edict forbade any magistrate or procurator in the government of a 
<A NAME="571"></A>province to exhibit a show of gladiators, or of wild beasts, or indeed 
<A NAME="572"></A>any other public entertainment; for hitherto our subjects had been as much 
<A NAME="573"></A>oppressed by such bribery as by actual extortion, while governors sought 
<A NAME="574"></A>to screen by corruption the guilty deeds of arbitrary 
<A NAME="575"></A>caprice.
<A NAME="576"></A><BR><BR>The Senate next passed a decree, providing alike for punishment 
<A NAME="577"></A>and safety. If a master were murdered by his slaves, all those who were 
<A NAME="578"></A>enfranchised by his will and lived under the same roof, were to suffer 
<A NAME="579"></A>the capital punishment with his other slaves. Lucius Varius, an ex-consul, 
<A NAME="580"></A>who had been crushed in the past under charges of extortion, was restored 
<A NAME="581"></A>to his rank as a senator. Pomponia Graecina, a distinguished lady, wife 
<A NAME="582"></A>of the Plautius who returned from Britain with an ovation, was accused 
<A NAME="583"></A>of some foreign superstition and handed over to her husband's judicial 
<A NAME="584"></A>decision. Following ancient precedent, he heard his wife's cause in the 
<A NAME="585"></A>presence of kinsfolk, involving, as it did, her legal status and character, 
<A NAME="586"></A>and he reported that she was innocent. This Pomponia lived a long life 
<A NAME="587"></A>of unbroken melancholy. After the murder of Julia, Drusus's daughter, by 
<A NAME="588"></A>Messalina's treachery, for forty years she wore only the attire of a mourner, 
<A NAME="589"></A>with a heart ever sorrowful. For this, during Claudius's reign, she escaped 
<A NAME="590"></A>unpunished, and it was afterwards counted a glory to 
<A NAME="591"></A>her.
<A NAME="592"></A><BR><BR>The same year saw many impeached. One of these, Publius Celer, 
<A NAME="593"></A>prosecuted by the province of Asia, the emperor could not acquit, and so 
<A NAME="594"></A>he put off the case till the man died of old age. Celer, as I have related, 
<A NAME="595"></A>had murdered Silanus, the pro-consul, and the magnitude of this crime veiled 
<A NAME="596"></A>his other enormities. Cossutianus Capito was accused by the people of Cilicia; 
<A NAME="597"></A>he was a man stained with the foulest guilt, and had actually imagined 
<A NAME="598"></A>that his audacious wickedness had the same rights in a province as he had 
<A NAME="599"></A>claimed for it at Rome. But he had to confront a determined prosecution, 
<A NAME="600"></A>and at last abandoned his defence. Eprius Marcellus, from whom Lycia demanded 
<A NAME="601"></A>compensation, was so powerfully supported by corrupt influence that some 
<A NAME="602"></A>of his accusers were punished with exile, as though they had imperilled 
<A NAME="603"></A>an innocent man.
<A NAME="604"></A><BR><BR>Nero entered on his third consulship with Valerius Messala, whose 
<A NAME="605"></A>great-grandfather, the orator Corvinus, was still remembered by a few old 
<A NAME="606"></A>men, as having been the colleague of the Divine Augustus, Nero's great-grandfather, 
<A NAME="607"></A>in the same office. But the honour of a noble house was further increased 
<A NAME="608"></A>by an annual grant of five hundred thousand sesterces on which Messala 
<A NAME="609"></A>might support virtuous poverty. Aurelius Cotta, too, and Haterius Antonius 
<A NAME="610"></A>had yearly stipends assigned them by the emperor, though they had squandered 
<A NAME="611"></A>their ancestral wealth in profligacy.
<A NAME="612"></A><BR><BR>Early in this year a war between Parthia and Rome about the possession 
<A NAME="613"></A>of Armenia, which, feebly begun, had hitherto dragged on, was vigorously 
<A NAME="614"></A>resumed. For Vologeses would not allow his brother Tiridates to be deprived 
<A NAME="615"></A>of a kingdom which he had himself given him, or to hold it as a gift from 
<A NAME="616"></A>a foreign power, and Corbulo too thought it due to the grandeur of Rome 
<A NAME="617"></A>that he should recover what Lucullus and Pompeius had formerly won. Besides, 
<A NAME="618"></A>the Armenians in the fluctuations of their allegiance sought the armed 
<A NAME="619"></A>protection of both empires, though by their country's position, by resemblance 
<A NAME="620"></A>of manners, and by the ties of intermarriage, they were more connected 
<A NAME="621"></A>with the Parthians, to whose subjection, in their ignorance of freedom, 
<A NAME="622"></A>they rather inclined.
<A NAME="623"></A><BR><BR>Corbulo however had more to struggle against in the supineness 
<A NAME="624"></A>of his soldiers than in the treachery of the enemy. His legions indeed, 
<A NAME="625"></A>transferred as they had been from Syria and demoralised by a long peace, 
<A NAME="626"></A>endured most impatiently the duties of a Roman camp. It was well known 
<A NAME="627"></A>that that army contained veterans who had never been on piquet duty or 
<A NAME="628"></A>on night guard, to whom the rampart and the fosse were new and strange 
<A NAME="629"></A>sights, men without helmets or breastplates, sleek money-making traders, 
<A NAME="630"></A>who had served all their time in towns. Corbulo having discharged all who 
<A NAME="631"></A>were old or in ill-health, sought to supply their places, and levies were 
<A NAME="632"></A>held in Galatia and Cappadocia, and to these were added a legion from Germany 
<A NAME="633"></A>with its auxiliary cavalry and light infantry. The entire army was kept 
<A NAME="634"></A>under canvas, though the winter was so severe that the ground, covered 
<A NAME="635"></A>as it was with ice, did not yield a place for the tents without being dug 
<A NAME="636"></A>up. Many of the men had their limbs frost-bitten through the intensity 
<A NAME="637"></A>of the cold, and some perished on guard. A soldier was observed whose hands 
<A NAME="638"></A>mortified as he was carrying a bundle of wood, so that sticking to their 
<A NAME="639"></A>burden they dropped off from his arms, now mere stumps. The general, lightly 
<A NAME="640"></A>clad, with head uncovered, was continually with his men on the march, amid 
<A NAME="641"></A>their labours; he had praise for the brave, comfort for the feeble, and 
<A NAME="642"></A>was a good example to all. And then as many shrank from the rigour of the 
<A NAME="643"></A>climate and of the service, and deserted, he sought a remedy in strictness 
<A NAME="644"></A>of discipline. Not, as in other armies, was a first or second offense condoned, 
<A NAME="645"></A>but the soldier, who had quitted his colours, instantly paid the penalty 
<A NAME="646"></A>with his life. This was shown by experience to be a wholesome measure, 
<A NAME="647"></A>better than mercy; for there were fewer desertions in that camp than in 
<A NAME="648"></A>those in which leniency was habitual.
<A NAME="649"></A><BR><BR>Meanwhile Corbulo kept his legions within the camp till spring 
<A NAME="650"></A>weather was fairly established, and having stationed his auxiliary infantry 
<A NAME="651"></A>at suitable points, he directed them not to begin an engagement. The charge 
<A NAME="652"></A>of these defensive positions he entrusted to Paccius Orfitus, who had held 
<A NAME="653"></A>the post of a first-rank centurion. Though this officer had reported that 
<A NAME="654"></A>the barbarians were heedless, and that an opportunity for success presented 
<A NAME="655"></A>itself, he was instructed to keep within his entrenchments and to wait 
<A NAME="656"></A>for a stronger force. But he broke the order, and on the arrival of a few 
<A NAME="657"></A>cavalry squadrons from the nearest forts, who in their inexperience insisted 
<A NAME="658"></A>on fighting, he engaged the enemy and was routed. Panic-stricken by his 
<A NAME="659"></A>disaster, those who ought to have given him support returned in precipitate 
<A NAME="660"></A>flight to their respective encampments. Corbulo heard of this with displeasure; 
<A NAME="661"></A>he sharply censured Paccius, the officers and soldiers, and ordered them 
<A NAME="662"></A>to have their quarters outside the lines. There they were kept in disgrace, 
<A NAME="663"></A>and were released only on the intercession of the whole 
<A NAME="664"></A>army.
<A NAME="665"></A><BR><BR>Tiridates meantime who, besides his own dependencies, had the powerful 
<A NAME="666"></A>aid of his brother Vologeses, ravaged Armenia, not in stealthy raids as 
<A NAME="667"></A>before, but in open war, plundering all whom he thought loyal to Rome, 
<A NAME="668"></A>while he eluded an action with any force which was brought against him, 
<A NAME="669"></A>and thus flying hither and thither, he spread panic more widely by rumour 
<A NAME="670"></A>than by arms. So Corbulo, frustrated in his prolonged efforts to bring 
<A NAME="671"></A>on an engagement and compelled, like the enemy, to carry hostilities everywhere, 
<A NAME="672"></A>divided his army, so that his generals and officers might attack several 
<A NAME="673"></A>points simultaneously. He at the same time instructed king Antiochus to 
<A NAME="674"></A>hasten to the provinces on his frontier, as Pharasmanes, after having slain 
<A NAME="675"></A>his son Rhadamistus as a traitor to prove his loyalty to us, was following 
<A NAME="676"></A>up more keenly than ever his old feud with the Armenians. Then, for the 
<A NAME="677"></A>first time, we won the friendship of the Moschi, a nation which became 
<A NAME="678"></A>pre-eminently attached to Rome, and they overran the wilds of Armenia. 
<A NAME="679"></A>Thus the intended plans of Tiridates were wholly reversed, and he sent 
<A NAME="680"></A>envoys to ask on behalf of himself and of the Parthians, why, when hostages 
<A NAME="681"></A>had lately been given and a friendship renewed which might open up a way 
<A NAME="682"></A>to further acts of good will, he was thus driven from Armenia, his ancient 
<A NAME="683"></A>possession.
<A NAME="684"></A><BR><BR>"As yet," he said, "Vologeses had not bestirred himself, simply 
<A NAME="685"></A>because they preferred negotiation to violence. Should however war be persisted 
<A NAME="686"></A>in, the Arsacids would not want the courage and good fortune which had 
<A NAME="687"></A>already been proved more than once by disaster to Rome." Corbulo in reply, 
<A NAME="688"></A>when he was certain that Vologeses was detained by the revolt of Hyrcania, 
<A NAME="689"></A>advised Tiridates to address a petition to the emperor, assuring him that 
<A NAME="690"></A>he might reign securely and without bloodshed by relinquishing a prospect 
<A NAME="691"></A>in the remote future for the sake of one more solid within his 
<A NAME="692"></A>reach.
<A NAME="693"></A><BR><BR>As no progress was made towards a final settlement of peace by 
<A NAME="694"></A>the interchange of messages, it was at last decided to fix a time and a 
<A NAME="695"></A>place for an interview between the leaders. "A thousand troopers," Tiridates 
<A NAME="696"></A>said, "would be his escort; what force of every kind was to be with Corbulo, 
<A NAME="697"></A>he did not prescribe, provided they came in peaceful fashion, without breastplates 
<A NAME="698"></A>and helmets." Any human being, to say nothing of an old and wary general, 
<A NAME="699"></A>would have seen through the barbarian's cunning, which assigned a limited 
<A NAME="700"></A>number on one side and offered a larger on the other, expressly with a 
<A NAME="701"></A>treacherous intent; for, were they to be exposed to a cavalry trained in 
<A NAME="702"></A>the use of arrows, with the person undefended, numbers would be unavailing. 
<A NAME="703"></A>Corbulo however, pretending not to understand this, replied that they would 
<A NAME="704"></A>do better to discuss matters requiring consideration for their common good, 
<A NAME="705"></A>in the presence of the entire armies, and he selected a place partly consisting 
<A NAME="706"></A>of gently sloping hills, suited for ranks of infantry, partly, of a spreading 
<A NAME="707"></A>plain where troops of cavalry could manoeuvre. On the appointed day, arriving 
<A NAME="708"></A>first, he posted his allied infantry with the king's auxiliaries on the 
<A NAME="709"></A>wings, the sixth legion in the centre, with which he had united three thousand 
<A NAME="710"></A>men of the third, brought up in the night from another camp, with one eagle, 
<A NAME="711"></A>so as to look like a single legion. Tiridates towards evening showed himself 
<A NAME="712"></A>at some distance whence he could be seen rather than heard. And so the 
<A NAME="713"></A>Roman general, without any conference, ordered his troops to retire to 
<A NAME="714"></A>their respective camps.
<A NAME="715"></A><BR><BR>The king either suspecting a stratagem from these simultaneous 
<A NAME="716"></A>movements in different directions, or intending to cut off our supplies 
<A NAME="717"></A>as they were coming up from the sea of Pontus and the town of Trapezus, 
<A NAME="718"></A>hastily withdrew. He could not however make any attack on the supplies, 
<A NAME="719"></A>as they were brought over mountains in the occupation of our forces. Corbulo, 
<A NAME="720"></A>that war might not be uselessly protracted, and also to compel the Armenians 
<A NAME="721"></A>to defend their possessions, prepared to destroy their fortresses, himself 
<A NAME="722"></A>undertaking the assault on the strongest of all in that province named 
<A NAME="723"></A>Volandum. The weaker he assigned to Cornelius Flaccus, his lieutenant, 
<A NAME="724"></A>and to Insteius Capito, his camp-prefect. Having then surveyed the defences 
<A NAME="725"></A>and provided everything suitable for storming them, he exhorted his soldiers 
<A NAME="726"></A>to strip of his home this vagabond foe who was preparing neither for peace 
<A NAME="727"></A>nor for war, but who confessed his treachery and cowardice by flight, and 
<A NAME="728"></A>so to secure alike glory and spoil. Then forming his army into four divisions, 
<A NAME="729"></A>he led one in the dense array of the "testudo" close up to the rampart, 
<A NAME="730"></A>to undermine it, while others were ordered to apply scaling ladders to 
<A NAME="731"></A>the walls, and many more were to discharge brands and javelins from engines. 
<A NAME="732"></A>The slingers and artillerymen had a position assigned them from which to 
<A NAME="733"></A>hurl their missiles at a distance, so that, with equal tumult everywhere, 
<A NAME="734"></A>no support might be given from any point to such as were pressed. So impetuous 
<A NAME="735"></A>were the efforts of the army that within a third part of one day the walls 
<A NAME="736"></A>were stripped of their defenders, the barriers of the gates overthrown, 
<A NAME="737"></A>the fortifications scaled and captured, and all the adult inhabitants massacred, 
<A NAME="738"></A>without the loss of a soldier and with but very few wounded. The nonmilitary 
<A NAME="739"></A>population were sold by auction; the rest of the booty fell to the 
<A NAME="740"></A>conquerors.
<A NAME="741"></A><BR><BR>Corbulo's lieutenant and camp-prefect met with similar success; 
<A NAME="742"></A>three forts were stormed by them in one day, and the remainder, some from 
<A NAME="743"></A>panic, others by the consent of the occupants, capitulated. This inspired 
<A NAME="744"></A>them with confidence to attack the capital of the country, Artaxata. The 
<A NAME="745"></A>legions however were not marched by the nearest route, for should they 
<A NAME="746"></A>cross the river Avaxes which washes the city's walls by a bridge, they 
<A NAME="747"></A>would be within missile-range. They passed over it at a distance, where 
<A NAME="748"></A>it was broad and shallow.
<A NAME="749"></A><BR><BR>Meantime Tiridates, ashamed of seeming utterly powerless by not 
<A NAME="750"></A>interfering with the siege, and afraid that, in attempting to stop it, 
<A NAME="751"></A>he would entangle himself and his cavalry on difficult ground, resolved 
<A NAME="752"></A>finally to display his forces and either give battle on the first opportunity, 
<A NAME="753"></A>or, by a pretended flight, prepare the way for some stratagem. Suddenly, 
<A NAME="754"></A>he threw himself on the Roman columns, without however surprising our general, 
<A NAME="755"></A>who had formed his army for fighting as well as for marching. On the right 
<A NAME="756"></A>and left flanks marched the third and sixth legions, with some picked men 
<A NAME="757"></A>of the tenth in the centre; the baggage was secured within the lines, and 
<A NAME="758"></A>the rear was guarded by a thousand cavalry, who were ordered to resist 
<A NAME="759"></A>any close attack of the enemy, but not to pursue his retreat. On the wings 
<A NAME="760"></A>were the foot-archers and the remainder of the cavalry, with a more extended 
<A NAME="761"></A>line on the left wing, along the base of some hills, so that should the 
<A NAME="762"></A>enemy penetrate the centre, he might be encountered both in front and flank. 
<A NAME="763"></A>Tiridates faced us in skirmishing order, but not within missile-range, 
<A NAME="764"></A>now threatening attack, now seemingly afraid, with the view of loosening 
<A NAME="765"></A>our formation and falling on isolated divisions. Finding that there was 
<A NAME="766"></A>no breaking of our ranks from rashness, and that only one cavalry officer 
<A NAME="767"></A>advanced too boldly, and that he falling pierced with arrows, confirmed 
<A NAME="768"></A>the rest in obedience by the warning, he retired on the approach of 
<A NAME="769"></A>darkness.
<A NAME="770"></A><BR><BR>Corbulo then encamped on the spot, and considered whether he should 
<A NAME="771"></A>push on his legions without their baggage to Artaxata and blockade the 
<A NAME="772"></A>city, on which, he supposed, Tiridates had fallen back. When his scouts 
<A NAME="773"></A>reported that the king had undertaken a long march, and that it was doubtful 
<A NAME="774"></A>whether Media or Albania was its destination, he waited for daylight, and 
<A NAME="775"></A>then sent on his light-armed troops, which were meanwhile to hover round 
<A NAME="776"></A>the walls and begin the attack from a distance. The inhabitants however 
<A NAME="777"></A>opened the gates of their own accord, and surrendered themselves and their 
<A NAME="778"></A>property to the Romans. This saved their lives; the city was fired, demolished 
<A NAME="779"></A>and levelled to the ground, as it could not be held without a strong garrison 
<A NAME="780"></A>from the extent of the walls, and we had not sufficient force to be divided 
<A NAME="781"></A>between adequately garrisoning it and carrying on the war. If again the 
<A NAME="782"></A>place were left untouched and unguarded, no advantage or glory would accrue 
<A NAME="783"></A>from its capture. Then too there was a wonderful occurrence, almost a divine 
<A NAME="784"></A>interposition. While the whole space outside the town, up to its buildings, 
<A NAME="785"></A>was bright with sunlight, the enclosure within the walls was suddenly shrouded 
<A NAME="786"></A>in a black cloud, seamed with lightning-flashes, and thus the city was 
<A NAME="787"></A>thought to be given up to destruction, as if heaven was wroth against 
<A NAME="788"></A>it.
<A NAME="789"></A><BR><BR>For all this Nero was unanimously saluted emperor, and by the Senate's 
<A NAME="790"></A>decree a thanksgiving was held; statues also, arches and successive consulships 
<A NAME="791"></A>were voted to him, and among the holy days were to be included the day 
<A NAME="792"></A>on which the victory was won, that on which it was announced, and that 
<A NAME="793"></A>on which the motion was brought forward. Other proposals too of a like 
<A NAME="794"></A>kind were carried, on a scale so extravagant, that Caius Cassius, after 
<A NAME="795"></A>having assented to the rest of the honours, argued that if the gods were 
<A NAME="796"></A>to be thanked for the bountiful favours of fortune, even a whole year would 
<A NAME="797"></A>not suffice for thanksgivings, and therefore there ought to be a classification 
<A NAME="798"></A>of sacred and business-days, that so they might observe divine ordinances 
<A NAME="799"></A>and yet not interfer with human affairs.
<A NAME="800"></A><BR><BR>A man who had struggled with various calamities and earned the 
<A NAME="801"></A>hate of many, was then impeached and condemned, but not without angry feelings 
<A NAME="802"></A>towards Seneca. This was Publius Suilius. He had been terrible and venal, 
<A NAME="803"></A>while Claudius reigned, and when times were changed, he was not so much 
<A NAME="804"></A>humbled as his enemies wished, and was one who would rather seem a criminal 
<A NAME="805"></A>than a suppliant. With the intent of crushing him, so men believed, a decree 
<A NAME="806"></A>of the Senate was revived, along with the penalty of the Cincian law against 
<A NAME="807"></A>persons who had pleaded for hire. Suilius spared not complaint or indignant 
<A NAME="808"></A>remonstrance; freespoken because of his extreme age as well as from his 
<A NAME="809"></A>insolent temper, he taunted Seneca with his savage enmity against the friends 
<A NAME="810"></A>of Claudius, under whose reign he had endured a most righteously deserved 
<A NAME="811"></A>exile. "The man," he said, "familiar as he was only with profitless studies, 
<A NAME="812"></A>and with the ignorance of boyhood, envied those who employed a lively and 
<A NAME="813"></A>genuine eloquence in the defence of their fellow-citizens. He had been 
<A NAME="814"></A>Germanicus's quaestor, while Seneca had been a paramour in his house. Was 
<A NAME="815"></A>it to be thought a worse offence to obtain a reward for honest service 
<A NAME="816"></A>with the litigant's consent, than to pollute the chambers of the imperial 
<A NAME="817"></A>ladies? By what kind of wisdom or maxims of philosophy had Seneca within 
<A NAME="818"></A>four years of royal favour amassed three hundred million sesterces? At 
<A NAME="819"></A>Rome the wills of the childless were, so to say, caught in his snare while 
<A NAME="820"></A>Italy and the provinces were drained by a boundless usury. His own money, 
<A NAME="821"></A>on the other hand, had been acquired by industry and was not excessive. 
<A NAME="822"></A>He would suffer prosecutions, perils, anything indeed rather than make 
<A NAME="823"></A>an old and self-learned position of honour to bow before an upstart 
<A NAME="824"></A>prosperity."
<A NAME="825"></A><BR><BR>Persons were not wanting to report all this to Seneca, in the exact 
<A NAME="826"></A>words, or with a worse sense put on it. Accusers were also found who alleged 
<A NAME="827"></A>that our allies had been plundered, when Suilius governed the province 
<A NAME="828"></A>of Asia, and that there had been embezzlement of public monies. Then, as 
<A NAME="829"></A>an entire year had been granted to them for inquiries, it seemed a shorter 
<A NAME="830"></A>plan to begin with his crimes at Rome, the witnesses of which were on the 
<A NAME="831"></A>spot. These men charged Suilius with having driven Quintus Pomponius by 
<A NAME="832"></A>a relentless prosecution into the extremity of civil war, with having forced 
<A NAME="833"></A>Julia, Drusus's daughter, and Sabina Poppaea to suicide, with having treacherously 
<A NAME="834"></A>ruined Valerius Asiaticus, Lusius Saturninus and Cornelius Lupus, in fact, 
<A NAME="835"></A>with the wholesale conviction of troops of Roman knights, and with all 
<A NAME="836"></A>the cruelty of Claudius. His defence was that of all this he had done nothing 
<A NAME="837"></A>on his own responsibility but had simply obeyed the emperor, till Nero 
<A NAME="838"></A>stopped such pleadings, by stating that he had ascertained from his father's 
<A NAME="839"></A>notebooks that he had never compelled the prosecution of a single 
<A NAME="840"></A>person.
<A NAME="841"></A><BR><BR>Suilius then sheltered himself under Messalina's orders, and the 
<A NAME="842"></A>defence began to collapse. "Why," it was asked, "was no one else chosen 
<A NAME="843"></A>to put his tongue at the service of that savage harlot? We must punish 
<A NAME="844"></A>the instruments of atrocious acts, when, having gained the rewards of wickedness, 
<A NAME="845"></A>they impute the wickedness to others."
<A NAME="846"></A><BR><BR>And so, with the loss of half his property, his son and granddaughter 
<A NAME="847"></A>being allowed to retain the other half, and what they had inherited under 
<A NAME="848"></A>their mother's or grandmother's will being also exempted from confiscation, 
<A NAME="849"></A>Suilius was banished to the Balearic isles. Neither in the crisis of his 
<A NAME="850"></A>peril nor after his condemnation did he quail in spirit. Rumour said that 
<A NAME="851"></A>he supported that lonely exile by a life of ease and plenty. When the accusers 
<A NAME="852"></A>attacked his son Nerullinus on the strength of men's hatred of the father 
<A NAME="853"></A>and of some charges of extortion, the emperor interposed, as if implying 
<A NAME="854"></A>that vengeange was fully satisfied.
<A NAME="855"></A><BR><BR>About the same time Octavius Sagitta, a tribune of the people, 
<A NAME="856"></A>who was enamoured to frenzy of Pontia, a married woman, bribed her by most 
<A NAME="857"></A>costly presents into an intrigue and then into abandoning her husband. 
<A NAME="858"></A>He had offered her marriage and had won her consent. But as soon as she 
<A NAME="859"></A>was free, she devised delays, pretended that her father's wishes were against 
<A NAME="860"></A>it, and having secured the prospect of a richer husband, she repudiated 
<A NAME="861"></A>her promises. Octavius, on the other hand, now remonstrated, now threatened; 
<A NAME="862"></A>his good name, he protested, was lost, his means exhausted, and as for 
<A NAME="863"></A>his life, which was all that was left to him, he surrendered it to her 
<A NAME="864"></A>mercy. When she spurned him, he asked the solace of one night, with which 
<A NAME="865"></A>to soothe his passion, that he might set bounds to it for the future. A 
<A NAME="866"></A>night was fixed, and Pontia intrusted the charge of her chamber to a female 
<A NAME="867"></A>slave acquainted with her secret. Octavius attended by one freedman entered 
<A NAME="868"></A>with a dagger concealed under his dress. Then, as usual in lovers' quarrels, 
<A NAME="869"></A>there were chidings, entreaties, reproaches, excuses, and some period of 
<A NAME="870"></A>the darkness was given up to passion; then, when seemingly about to go, 
<A NAME="871"></A>and she was fearing nothing, he stabbed her with the steel, and having 
<A NAME="872"></A>wounded and scared away the slave girl who was hurrying to her, rushed 
<A NAME="873"></A>out of the chamber. Next day the murder was notorious, and there was no 
<A NAME="874"></A>question as to the murderer, for it was proved that he had passed some 
<A NAME="875"></A>time with her. The freedman, however, declared the deed was his, that he 
<A NAME="876"></A>had, in fact, avenged his patron's wrongs. He had made some impression 
<A NAME="877"></A>by the nobleness of his example, when the slave girl recovered and revealed 
<A NAME="878"></A>the truth. Octavius, when he ceased to be tribune, was prosecuted before 
<A NAME="879"></A>the consuls by the father of the murdered woman, and was condemned by the 
<A NAME="880"></A>sentence of the Senate under "the law concerning assassins."
<A NAME="881"></A><BR><BR>A profligacy equally notorious in that same year proved the beginning 
<A NAME="882"></A>of great evils to the State. There was at Rome one Sabina Poppaea; her 
<A NAME="883"></A>father was Titus Ollius, but she had assumed the name of her maternal grandfather 
<A NAME="884"></A>Poppaeus Sabinus, a man of illustrious memory and pre-eminently distinguished 
<A NAME="885"></A>by the honours of a consulship and a triumph. As for Ollius, before he 
<A NAME="886"></A>attained promotion, the friendship of Sejanus was his ruin. This Poppaea 
<A NAME="887"></A>had everything but a right mind. Her mother, who surpassed in personal 
<A NAME="888"></A>attractions all the ladies of her day, had bequeathed to her alike fame 
<A NAME="889"></A>and beauty. Her fortune adequately corresponded to the nobility of her 
<A NAME="890"></A>descent. Her conversation was charming and her wit anything but dull. She 
<A NAME="891"></A>professed virtue, while she practised laxity. Seldom did she appear in 
<A NAME="892"></A>public, and it was always with her face partly veiled, either to disappoint 
<A NAME="893"></A>men's gaze or to set off her beauty. Her character she never spared, making 
<A NAME="894"></A>no distinction between a husband and a paramour, while she was never a 
<A NAME="895"></A>slave to her own passion or to that of her lover. Wherever there was a 
<A NAME="896"></A>prospect of advantage, there she transferred her favours. And so while 
<A NAME="897"></A>she was living as the wife of Rufius Crispinus, a Roman knight, by whom 
<A NAME="898"></A>she had a son, she was attracted by the youth and fashionable elegance 
<A NAME="899"></A>of Otho, and by the fact too that he was reputed to have Nero's most ardent 
<A NAME="900"></A>friendship. Without any delay the intrigue was followed by 
<A NAME="901"></A>marriage.
<A NAME="902"></A><BR><BR>Otho now began to praise his wife's beauty and accomplishments 
<A NAME="903"></A>to the emperor, either from a lover's thoughtlessness or to inflame Nero's 
<A NAME="904"></A>passion, in the hope of adding to his own influence by the further tie 
<A NAME="905"></A>which would arise out of possession of the same woman. Often, as he rose 
<A NAME="906"></A>from the emperor's table, was he heard repeatedly to say that he was going 
<A NAME="907"></A>to her, to the high birth and beauty which had fallen to his lot, to that 
<A NAME="908"></A>which all men pray for, the joy of the fortunate. These and like incitements 
<A NAME="909"></A>allowed but of brief delay. Once having gained admission, Poppaea won her 
<A NAME="910"></A>way by artful blandishments, pretending that she could not resist her passion 
<A NAME="911"></A>and that she was captivated by Nero's person. Soon, as the emperor's love 
<A NAME="912"></A>grew ardent, she would change and be supercilious, and, if she were detained 
<A NAME="913"></A>more than one or two nights, would say again and again that she was a married 
<A NAME="914"></A>woman and could not give up her husband attached as she was to Otho by 
<A NAME="915"></A>a manner of life, which no one equalled. "His ideas and his style were 
<A NAME="916"></A>grand; at his house everything worthy of the highest fortune was ever before 
<A NAME="917"></A>her eyes. Nero, on the contrary, with his slave girl mistress, tied down 
<A NAME="918"></A>by his attachment to Acte, had derived nothing from his slavish associations 
<A NAME="919"></A>but what was low and degrading."
<A NAME="920"></A><BR><BR>Otho was now cut off from Nero's usual familiar intercourse, and 
<A NAME="921"></A>then even from interviews and from the royal suite, and at last was appointed 
<A NAME="922"></A>governor of the province of Lusitania, that he might not be the emperor's 
<A NAME="923"></A>rival at Rome. There he lived up to the time of the civil wars, not in 
<A NAME="924"></A>the fashion of his disgraceful past, but uprightly and virtuously, a pleasure-loving 
<A NAME="925"></A>man when idle, and self-restrained when in power.
<A NAME="926"></A><BR><BR>Hitherto Nero had sought a veil for his abominations and wickedness. 
<A NAME="927"></A>He was particularly suspicious of Cornelius Sulla, whose apathetic temper 
<A NAME="928"></A>he interpreted as really the reverse, inferring that he was, in fact, an 
<A NAME="929"></A>artful dissembler. Graptus, one of the emperor's freedmen, whose age and 
<A NAME="930"></A>experience had made him thoroughly acquainted with the imperial household 
<A NAME="931"></A>from the time of Tiberius, quickened these apprehensions by the following 
<A NAME="932"></A>falsehood. The Mulvian bridge was then a famous haunt of nightly profligacy, 
<A NAME="933"></A>and Nero used to go there that he might take his pleasures more freely 
<A NAME="934"></A>outside the city. So Graptus, taking advantage of an idle panic into which 
<A NAME="935"></A>the royal attendants had chanced to have been thrown on their return by 
<A NAME="936"></A>one of those youthful frolics which were then everywhere practised, invented 
<A NAME="937"></A>a story that a treacherous attack had been planned on the emperor, should 
<A NAME="938"></A>he go back by the Flaminian road, and that through the favour of destiny 
<A NAME="939"></A>he had escaped it, as he went home by a different way to Sallust's gardens. 
<A NAME="940"></A>Sulla, he said, was the author of this plot. Not one, however, of Sulla's 
<A NAME="941"></A>slaves or clients was recognised, and his character, despicable as it was 
<A NAME="942"></A>and incapable of a daring act, was utterly at variance with the charge. 
<A NAME="943"></A>Still, just as if he had been found guilty, he was ordered to leave his 
<A NAME="944"></A>country, and confine himself within the walls of Massilia.
<A NAME="945"></A><BR><BR>During the same consulship a hearing was given to two conflicting 
<A NAME="946"></A>deputations from Puteoli, sent to the Senate by the town council and by 
<A NAME="947"></A>the populace. The first spoke bitterly of the violence of the multitude; 
<A NAME="948"></A>the second, of the rapacity of the magistrates and of all the chief citizens. 
<A NAME="949"></A>That the disturbance, which had gone as far as stoning and threats of fire, 
<A NAME="950"></A>might not lead on to bloodshed and armed fighting, Caius Cassius was appointed 
<A NAME="951"></A>to apply some remedy. As they would not endure his rigour, the charge of 
<A NAME="952"></A>the affair was at his own request transferred to the brothers Scribonii, 
<A NAME="953"></A>to whom was given a praetorian cohort, the terror of which, coupled with 
<A NAME="954"></A>the execution of a few persons, restored peace to the 
<A NAME="955"></A>townspeople.
<A NAME="956"></A><BR><BR>I should not mention a very trivial decree of the Senate which 
<A NAME="957"></A>allowed the city of Syracuse to exceed the prescribed number in their gladiatorial 
<A NAME="958"></A>shows, had not Paetus Thrasea spoken against it and furnished his traducers 
<A NAME="959"></A>with a ground for censuring his motion. "Why," it was asked, "if he thought 
<A NAME="960"></A>that the public welfare required freedom of speech in the Senate, did he 
<A NAME="961"></A>pursue such trifling abuses? Why should he not speak for or against peace 
<A NAME="962"></A>and war, or on the taxes and laws and other matters involving Roman interests? 
<A NAME="963"></A>The senators, as often as they received the privilege of stating an opinion, 
<A NAME="964"></A>were at liberty to say out what they pleased, and to claim that it should 
<A NAME="965"></A>be put to the vote. Was it the only worthy object of reform to provide 
<A NAME="966"></A>that the Syracusans should not give shows on a larger scale? Were all other 
<A NAME="967"></A>matters in every department of the empire as admirable as if Thrasea and 
<A NAME="968"></A>not Nero had the direction of them? But if the highest affairs were passed 
<A NAME="969"></A>by and ignored, how much more ought there to be no meddling with things 
<A NAME="970"></A>wholly insignificant."
<A NAME="971"></A><BR><BR>Thrasea in reply, when his friends asked an explanation, said "that 
<A NAME="972"></A>it was not in ignorance of Rome's actual condition that he sought to correct 
<A NAME="973"></A>such decrees, but that he was giving what was due to the honour of the 
<A NAME="974"></A>senators, in making it evident that those who attended even to the merest 
<A NAME="975"></A>trifles, would not disguise their responsibility for important 
<A NAME="976"></A>affairs."
<A NAME="977"></A><BR><BR>That same year, repeated demands on the part of the people, who 
<A NAME="978"></A>denounced the excessive greed of the revenue collectors, made Nero doubt 
<A NAME="979"></A>whether he should not order the repeal of all indirect taxes, and so confer 
<A NAME="980"></A>a most splendid boon on the human race. But this sudden impulse was checked 
<A NAME="981"></A>by the senators, who, having first heartily praised the grandeur of his 
<A NAME="982"></A>conception, pointed out "that the dissolution of the empire must ensue 
<A NAME="983"></A>if the revenues which supported the State were to be diminished; for as 
<A NAME="984"></A>soon as the customs were swept away, there would follow a demand for the 
<A NAME="985"></A>abolition of the direct taxes. Many companies for the collection of the 
<A NAME="986"></A>indirect taxes had been formed by consuls and tribunes, when the freedom 
<A NAME="987"></A>of the Roman people was still in its vigour, and arrangements were subsequently 
<A NAME="988"></A>made to insure an exact correspondence between the amount of income and 
<A NAME="989"></A>the necessary disbursements. Certainly some restraint, they admitted, must 
<A NAME="990"></A>be put on the cupidity of the revenue collectors, that they might not by 
<A NAME="991"></A>new oppressions bring into odium what for so many years had been endured 
<A NAME="992"></A>without a complaint."
<A NAME="993"></A><BR><BR>Accordingly the emperor issued an edict that the regulations about 
<A NAME="994"></A>every branch of the public revenue, which had hitherto been kept secret, 
<A NAME="995"></A>should be published; that claims which had been dropped should not be revived 
<A NAME="996"></A>after a year; that the praetor at Rome, the propraetor or proconsul in 
<A NAME="997"></A>the provinces, should give judicial precedence to all cases against the 
<A NAME="998"></A>collectors; that the soldiers should retain their immunities except when 
<A NAME="999"></A>they traded for profit, with other very equitable arrangements, which for 
<A NAME="1000"></A>a short time were maintained and were subsequently disregarded. However, 
<A NAME="1001"></A>the repeal of the two per cent. and two-and-a-half per cent. taxes remains 
<A NAME="1002"></A>in force, as well as that of others bearing names invented by the collectors 
<A NAME="1003"></A>to cover their illegal exactions. In our transmarine provinces the conveyance 
<A NAME="1004"></A>of corn was rendered less costly, and it was decided that merchant ships 
<A NAME="1005"></A>should not be assessed with their owner's property, and that no tax should 
<A NAME="1006"></A>be paid on them.
<A NAME="1007"></A><BR><BR>Two men under prosecution from Africa, in which province they had 
<A NAME="1008"></A>held proconsular authority, Sulpicius Camerinus and Pomponius Silvanus, 
<A NAME="1009"></A>were acquitted by the emperor. Camerinus had against him a few private 
<A NAME="1010"></A>persons who charged him with cruelty rather than with extortion. Silvanus 
<A NAME="1011"></A>was beset by a host of accusers, who demanded time for summoning their 
<A NAME="1012"></A>witnesses, while the defendant insisted on being at once put on his defence. 
<A NAME="1013"></A>And he was successful, through his wealth, his childlessness, and his old 
<A NAME="1014"></A>age, which he prolonged beyond the life of those by whose corrupt influence 
<A NAME="1015"></A>he had escaped.
<A NAME="1016"></A><BR><BR>Up to this time everything had been quiet in Germany, from the 
<A NAME="1017"></A>temper of the generals, who, now that triumphal decorations had been vulgarised, 
<A NAME="1018"></A>hoped for greater glory by the maintenance of peace. Paulinus Pompeius 
<A NAME="1019"></A>and Lucius Vetus were then in command of the army. Still, to avoid keeping 
<A NAME="1020"></A>the soldiers in idleness, the first completed the embankment begun sixty-three 
<A NAME="1021"></A>years before by Drusus to confine the waters of the Rhine, while Vetus 
<A NAME="1022"></A>prepared to connect the Moselle and the Arar by a canal, so that troops 
<A NAME="1023"></A>crossing the sea and then conveyed on the Rhone and Arar might sail by 
<A NAME="1024"></A>this canal into the Moselle and the Rhine, and thence to the ocean. Thus 
<A NAME="1025"></A>the difficulties of the route being removed, there would be communication 
<A NAME="1026"></A>for ships between the shores of the west and of the 
<A NAME="1027"></A>north.
<A NAME="1028"></A><BR><BR>Aelius Gracilis, the governor of Belgica, discouraged the work 
<A NAME="1029"></A>by seeking to deter Vetus from bringing his legions into another man's 
<A NAME="1030"></A>province, and so drawing to himself the attachment of Gaul. This result 
<A NAME="1031"></A>he repeatedly said would excite the fears of the emperor, an assertion 
<A NAME="1032"></A>by which meritorious undertakings are often hindered.
<A NAME="1033"></A><BR><BR>Meantime, from the continued inaction of our armies, a rumour prevailed 
<A NAME="1034"></A>that the commanders had been deprived of the right of leading them against 
<A NAME="1035"></A>the enemy. Thereupon the Frisii moved up their youth to the forests and 
<A NAME="1036"></A>swamps, and their non-fighting population, over the lakes, to the river-bank, 
<A NAME="1037"></A>and established themselves in unoccupied lands, reserved for the use of 
<A NAME="1038"></A>our soldiers, under the leadership of Verritus and Malorix, the kings of 
<A NAME="1039"></A>the tribe, as far as Germans are under kings. Already they had settled 
<A NAME="1040"></A>themselves in houses, had sown the fields, and were cultivating the soil 
<A NAME="1041"></A>as if it had been their ancestors', when Dubius Avitus, who had succeeded 
<A NAME="1042"></A>Paulinus in the province, by threatening them with a Roman attack if they 
<A NAME="1043"></A>did not retire into their old country or obtain a new territory from the 
<A NAME="1044"></A>emperor, constrained Verritus and Malorix to become suppliants. They went 
<A NAME="1045"></A>to Rome, and while they waited for Nero, who was intent on other engagements, 
<A NAME="1046"></A>among the sights shown to the barbarians they were admitted into Pompey's 
<A NAME="1047"></A>theatre, where they might behold the vastness of the Roman people. There 
<A NAME="1048"></A>at their leisure (for in the entertainment, ignorant as they were, they 
<A NAME="1049"></A>found no amusement) they asked questions about the crowd on the benches, 
<A NAME="1050"></A>about the distinctions of classes, who were the knights, where was the 
<A NAME="1051"></A>Senate, till they observed some persons in a foreign dress on the seats 
<A NAME="1052"></A>of the senators. Having asked who they were, when they were told that this 
<A NAME="1053"></A>honour was granted to envoys from those nations which were distinguished 
<A NAME="1054"></A>for their bravery and their friendship to Rome, they exclaimed that no 
<A NAME="1055"></A>men on earth surpassed the Germans in arms or in loyalty. Then they went 
<A NAME="1056"></A>down and took their seat among the senators. The spectators hailed the 
<A NAME="1057"></A>act goodnaturedly, as due to the impulsiveness of a primitive people and 
<A NAME="1058"></A>to an honourable rivalry. Nero gave both of them the Roman franchise, and 
<A NAME="1059"></A>ordered the Frisii to withdraw from the territory in question. When they 
<A NAME="1060"></A>disdained obedience, some auxiliary cavalry by a sudden attack made it 
<A NAME="1061"></A>a necessity for them, capturing or slaughtering those who obstinately 
<A NAME="1062"></A>resisted.
<A NAME="1063"></A><BR><BR>Of this same territory, the Ampsivarii now possessed themselves, 
<A NAME="1064"></A>a tribe more powerful not only from their numbers, but from having the 
<A NAME="1065"></A>sympathy of the neighbouring peoples, as they had been expelled by the 
<A NAME="1066"></A>Chauci and had to beg, as homeless outcasts, a secure exile. Their cause 
<A NAME="1067"></A>was pleaded by a man, famous among those nations and loyal to Rome, Boiocalus 
<A NAME="1068"></A>by name, who reminded us that on the Cheruscan revolt he had been imprisoned 
<A NAME="1069"></A>by the order of Arminius, that afterwards he had served under the leadership 
<A NAME="1070"></A>of Tiberius and of Germanicus, and that to a fifty years' obedience he 
<A NAME="1071"></A>was adding the merit of subjecting his tribe to our dominion. "What an 
<A NAME="1072"></A>extent of plain," he would say, "lies open into which the flocks and herds 
<A NAME="1073"></A>of the Roman soldiers may some day be sent! Let them by all means keep 
<A NAME="1074"></A>retreats for their cattle, while men are starving; only let them not prefer 
<A NAME="1075"></A>a waste and a solitude to friendly nations. Once these fields belonged 
<A NAME="1076"></A>to the Chamavi; then to the Tubantes; after them to the Usipii. As heaven 
<A NAME="1077"></A>is for the gods, so the earth has been given to mankind, and lands uninhabited 
<A NAME="1078"></A>are common to all." Then looking up to the sun and invoking the other heavenly 
<A NAME="1079"></A>bodies, he asked them, as though standing in their presence, "whether they 
<A NAME="1080"></A>wished to behold an empty soil; rather let them submerge it beneath the 
<A NAME="1081"></A>sea against the plunderers of the land."
<A NAME="1082"></A><BR><BR>Avitus was impressed by this language and said that people must 
<A NAME="1083"></A>submit to the rule of their betters; that the gods to whom they appealed, 
<A NAME="1084"></A>had willed that the decision as to what should be given or taken from them, 
<A NAME="1085"></A>was to rest
