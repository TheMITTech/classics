<A NAME="start"></A>
<A NAME="10"></A>A.D. 16-19
<A NAME="11"></A><BR><BR>In the consulship of Sisenna Statilius Taurus and Lucius Libo there 
<A NAME="12"></A>was a commotion in the kingdoms and Roman provinces of the East. It had 
<A NAME="13"></A>its origin among the Parthians, who disdained as a foreigner a king whom 
<A NAME="14"></A>they had sought and received from Rome, though he was of the family of 
<A NAME="15"></A>the Arsacids. This was Vonones, who had been given as an hostage to Augustus 
<A NAME="16"></A>by Phraates. For although he had driven before him armies and generals 
<A NAME="17"></A>from Rome, Phraates had shown to Augustus every token of reverence and 
<A NAME="18"></A>had sent him some of his children, to cement the friendship, not so much 
<A NAME="19"></A>from dread of us as from distrust of the loyalty of his 
<A NAME="20"></A>countrymen.
<A NAME="21"></A><BR><BR>After the death of Phraates and the succeeding kings in the bloodshed 
<A NAME="22"></A>of civil wars, there came to Rome envoys from the chief men of Parthia, 
<A NAME="23"></A>in quest of Vonones, his eldest son. Caesar thought this a great honour 
<A NAME="24"></A>to himself, and loaded Vonones with wealth. The barbarians, too, welcomed 
<A NAME="25"></A>him with rejoicing, as is usual with new rulers. Soon they felt shame at 
<A NAME="26"></A>Parthians having become degenerate, at their having sought a king from 
<A NAME="27"></A>another world, one too infected with the training of the enemy, at the 
<A NAME="28"></A>throne of the Arsacids now being possessed and given away among the provinces 
<A NAME="29"></A>of Rome. "Where," they asked, "was the glory of the men who slew Crassus, 
<A NAME="30"></A>who drove out Antonius, if Caesar's drudge, after an endurance of so many 
<A NAME="31"></A>years' slavery, were to rule over Parthians."
<A NAME="32"></A><BR><BR>Vonones himself too further provoked their disdain, by his contrast 
<A NAME="33"></A>with their ancestral manners, by his rare indulgence in the chase, by his 
<A NAME="34"></A>feeble interest in horses, by the litter in which he was carried whenever 
<A NAME="35"></A>he made a progress through their cities, and by his contemptuous dislike 
<A NAME="36"></A>of their national festivities. They also ridiculed his Greek attendants 
<A NAME="37"></A>and his keeping under seal the commonest household articles. But he was 
<A NAME="38"></A>easy of approach; his courtesy was open to all, and he had thus virtues 
<A NAME="39"></A>with which the Parthians were unfamiliar, and vices new to them. And as 
<A NAME="40"></A>his ways were quite alien from theirs they hated alike what was bad and 
<A NAME="41"></A>what was good in him.
<A NAME="42"></A><BR><BR>Accordingly they summoned Artabanus, an Arsacid by blood, who had 
<A NAME="43"></A>grown to manhood among the Dahae, and who, though routed in the first encounter, 
<A NAME="44"></A>rallied his forces and possessed himself of the kingdom. The conquered 
<A NAME="45"></A>Vonones found a refuge in Armenia, then a free country, and exposed to 
<A NAME="46"></A>the power of Parthia and Rome, without being trusted by either, in consequence 
<A NAME="47"></A>of the crime of Antonius, who, under the guise of friendship, had inveigled 
<A NAME="48"></A>Artavasdes, king of the Armenians, then loaded him with chains, and finally 
<A NAME="49"></A>murdered him. His son, Artaxias, our bitter foe because of his father's 
<A NAME="50"></A>memory, found defence for himself and his kingdom in the might of the Arsacids. 
<A NAME="51"></A>When he was slain by the treachery of kinsmen, Caesar gave Tigranes to 
<A NAME="52"></A>the Armenians, and he was put in possession of the kingdom under the escort 
<A NAME="53"></A>of Tiberius Nero. But neither Tigranes nor his children reigned long, though, 
<A NAME="54"></A>in foreign fashion, they were united in marriage and in royal 
<A NAME="55"></A>power.
<A NAME="56"></A><BR><BR>Next, at the bidding of Augustus, Artavasdes was set on the throne, 
<A NAME="57"></A>nor was he deposed without disaster to ourselves. Caius Caesar was then 
<A NAME="58"></A>appointed to restore order in Armenia. He put over the Armenians Ariobarzanes, 
<A NAME="59"></A>a Mede by birth, whom they willingly accepted, because of his singularly 
<A NAME="60"></A>handsome person and noble spirit. On the death of Ariobarzanes through 
<A NAME="61"></A>a fatal accident, they would not endure his son. Having tried the government 
<A NAME="62"></A>of a woman named Erato and having soon afterwards driven her from them, 
<A NAME="63"></A>bewildered and disorganised, rather indeed without a ruler than enjoying 
<A NAME="64"></A>freedom, they received for their king the fugitive Vonones. When, however, 
<A NAME="65"></A>Artabanus began to threaten, and but feeble support could be given by the 
<A NAME="66"></A>Armenians, or war with Parthia would have to be undertaken, if Vonones 
<A NAME="67"></A>was to be upheld by our arms, the governor of Syria, Creticus Silanus, 
<A NAME="68"></A>sent for him and kept him under surveillance, letting him retain his royal 
<A NAME="69"></A>pomp and title. How Vonones meditated an escape from this mockery, I will 
<A NAME="70"></A>relate in the proper place.
<A NAME="71"></A><BR><BR>Meanwhile the commotion in the East was rather pleasing to Tiberius, 
<A NAME="72"></A>as it was a pretext for withdrawing Germanicus from the legions which knew 
<A NAME="73"></A>him well, and placing him over new provinces where he would be exposed 
<A NAME="74"></A>both to treachery and to disasters. Germanicus, however, in proportion 
<A NAME="75"></A>to the strength of the soldiers' attachment and to his uncle's dislike, 
<A NAME="76"></A>was eager to hasten his victory, and he pondered on plans of battle, and 
<A NAME="77"></A>on the reverses or successes which during more than three years of war 
<A NAME="78"></A>had fallen to his lot. The Germans, he knew, were beaten in the field and 
<A NAME="79"></A>on fair ground; they were helped by woods, swamps, short summers, and early 
<A NAME="80"></A>winters. His own troops were affected not so much by wounds as by long 
<A NAME="81"></A>marches and damage to their arms. Gaul had been exhausted by supplying 
<A NAME="82"></A>horses; a long baggage-train presented facilities for ambuscades, and was 
<A NAME="83"></A>embarrassing to its defenders. But by embarking on the sea, invasion would 
<A NAME="84"></A>be easy for them, and a surprise to the enemy, while a campaign too would 
<A NAME="85"></A>be more quickly begun, the legions and supplies would be brought up simultaneously, 
<A NAME="86"></A>and the cavalry with their horses would arrive, in good condition, by the 
<A NAME="87"></A>rivermouths and channels, at the heart of Germany.
<A NAME="88"></A><BR><BR>To this accordingly he gave his mind, and sent Publius Vitellius 
<A NAME="89"></A>and Caius Antius to collect the taxes of Gaul. Silius, Anteius, and Caecina 
<A NAME="90"></A>had the charge of building a fleet. It seemed that a thousand vessels were 
<A NAME="91"></A>required, and they were speedily constructed, some of small draught with 
<A NAME="92"></A>a narrow stem and stern and a broad centre, that they might bear the waves 
<A NAME="93"></A>more easily; some flat-bottomed, that they might ground without being injured; 
<A NAME="94"></A>several, furnished with a rudder at each end, so that by a sudden shifting 
<A NAME="95"></A>of the oars they might be run into shore either way. Many were covered 
<A NAME="96"></A>in with decks, on which engines for missiles might be conveyed, and were 
<A NAME="97"></A>also fit for the carrying of horses or supplies, and being equipped with 
<A NAME="98"></A>sails as well as rapidly moved by oars, they assumed, through the enthusiasm 
<A NAME="99"></A>of our soldiers, an imposing and formidable aspect.
<A NAME="100"></A><BR><BR>The island of the Batavi was the appointed rendezvous, because 
<A NAME="101"></A>of its easy landing-places, and its convenience for receiving the army 
<A NAME="102"></A>and carrying the war across the river. For the Rhine after flowing continuously 
<A NAME="103"></A>in a single channel or encircling merely insignificant islands, divides 
<A NAME="104"></A>itself, so to say, where the Batavian territory begins, into two rivers, 
<A NAME="105"></A>retaining its name and the rapidity of its course in the stream which washes 
<A NAME="106"></A>Germany, till it mingles with the ocean. On the Gallic bank, its flow is 
<A NAME="107"></A>broader and gentler; it is called by an altered name, the Vahal, by the 
<A NAME="108"></A>inhabitants of its shore. Soon that name too is changed for the Mosa river, 
<A NAME="109"></A>through whose vast mouth it empties itself into the same 
<A NAME="110"></A>ocean.
<A NAME="111"></A><BR><BR>Caesar, however, while the vessels were coming up, ordered Silius, 
<A NAME="112"></A>his lieutenant-general, to make an inroad on the Chatti with a flying column. 
<A NAME="113"></A>He himself, on hearing that a fort on the river Luppia was being besieged, 
<A NAME="114"></A>led six legions to the spot. Silius owing to sudden rains did nothing but 
<A NAME="115"></A>carry off a small booty, and the wife and daughter of Arpus, the chief 
<A NAME="116"></A>of the Chatti. And Caesar had no opportunity of fighting given him by the 
<A NAME="117"></A>besiegers, who dispersed on the rumour of his advance. They had, however, 
<A NAME="118"></A>destroyed the barrow lately raised in memory of Varus's legions, and the 
<A NAME="119"></A>old altar of Drusus. The prince restored the altar, and himself with his 
<A NAME="120"></A>legions celebrated funeral games in his father's honour. To raise a new 
<A NAME="121"></A>barrow was not thought necessary. All the country between the fort Aliso 
<A NAME="122"></A>and the Rhine was thoroughly secured by new barriers and 
<A NAME="123"></A>earthworks.
<A NAME="124"></A><BR><BR>By this time the fleet had arrived, and Caesar, having sent on 
<A NAME="125"></A>his supplies and assigned vessels for the legions and the allied troops, 
<A NAME="126"></A>entered "Drusus's fosse," as it was called. He prayed Drusus his father 
<A NAME="127"></A>to lend him, now that he was venturing on the same enterprise, the willing 
<A NAME="128"></A>and favourable aid of the example and wi memory of his counsels and achievements, 
<A NAME="129"></A>and he arrived after a prosperous voyage through the lakes and the ocean 
<A NAME="130"></A>as far as the river Amisia. His fleet remained there on the left bank of 
<A NAME="131"></A>the stream, and it was a blunder that he did not have it brought up the 
<A NAME="132"></A>river. He disembarked the troops, which were to be marched to the country 
<A NAME="133"></A>on the right, and thus several days were wasted in the construction of 
<A NAME="134"></A>bridges. The cavalry and the legions fearlessly crossed the first estuaries 
<A NAME="135"></A>in which the tide had not yet risen. The rear of the auxiliaries, and the 
<A NAME="136"></A>Batavi among the number, plunging recklessly into the water and displaying 
<A NAME="137"></A>their skill in swimming, fell into disorder, and some were drowned. While 
<A NAME="138"></A>Caesar was measuring out his camp, he was told of a revolt of the Angrivarii 
<A NAME="139"></A>in his rear. He at once despatched Stertinius with some cavalry and a light 
<A NAME="140"></A>armed force, who punished their perfidy with fire and 
<A NAME="141"></A>sword.
<A NAME="142"></A><BR><BR>The waters of the Visurgis flowed between the Romans and the Cherusci. 
<A NAME="143"></A>On its banks stood Arminius with the other chiefs. He asked whether Caesar 
<A NAME="144"></A>had arrived, and on the reply that he was present, he begged leave to have 
<A NAME="145"></A>an interview with his brother. That brother, surnamed Flavus, was with 
<A NAME="146"></A>our army, a man famous for his loyalty, and for having lost an eye by a 
<A NAME="147"></A>wound, a few years ago, when Tiberius was in command. The permission was 
<A NAME="148"></A>then given, and he stepped forth and was saluted by Arminius, who had removed 
<A NAME="149"></A>his guards to a distance and required that the bowmen ranged on our bank 
<A NAME="150"></A>should retire. When they had gone away, Arminius asked his brother whence 
<A NAME="151"></A>came the scar which disfigured his face, and on being told the particular 
<A NAME="152"></A>place and battle, he inquired what reward he had received. Flavus spoke 
<A NAME="153"></A>of increased pay, of a neck chain, a crown, and other military gifts, while 
<A NAME="154"></A>Arminius jeered at such a paltry recompense for slavery.
<A NAME="155"></A><BR><BR>Then began a controversy. The one spoke of the greatness of Rome, 
<A NAME="156"></A>the resources of Caesar, the dreadful punishment in store for the vanquished, 
<A NAME="157"></A>the ready mercy for him who surrenders, and the fact that neither Arminius's 
<A NAME="158"></A>wife nor his son were treated as enemies; the other, of the claims of fatherland, 
<A NAME="159"></A>of ancestral freedom, of the gods of the homes of Germany, of the mother 
<A NAME="160"></A>who shared his prayers, that Flavus might not choose to be the deserter 
<A NAME="161"></A>and betrayer rather than the ruler of his kinsfolk and relatives, and indeed 
<A NAME="162"></A>of his own people.
<A NAME="163"></A><BR><BR>By degrees they fell to bitter words, and even the river between 
<A NAME="164"></A>them would not have hindered them from joining combat, had not Stertinius 
<A NAME="165"></A>hurried up and put his hand on Flavus, who in the full tide of his fury 
<A NAME="166"></A>was demanding his weapons and his charger. Arminius was seen facing him, 
<A NAME="167"></A>full of menaces and challenging him to conflict. Much of what he said was 
<A NAME="168"></A>in Roman speech, for he had served in our camp as leader of his 
<A NAME="169"></A>fellow-countrymen.
<A NAME="170"></A><BR><BR>Next day the German army took up its position on the other side 
<A NAME="171"></A>of the Visurgis. Caesar, thinking that without bridges and troops to guard 
<A NAME="172"></A>them, it would not be good generalship to expose the legions to danger, 
<A NAME="173"></A>sent the cavalry across the river by the fords. It was commanded by Stertinius 
<A NAME="174"></A>and Aemilius, one of the first rank centurions, who attacked at widely 
<A NAME="175"></A>different points so as to distract the enemy. Chariovalda, the Batavian 
<A NAME="176"></A>chief, dashed to the charge where the stream is most rapid. The Cherusci, 
<A NAME="177"></A>by a pretended flight, drew him into a plain surrounded by forest-passes. 
<A NAME="178"></A>Then bursting on him in a sudden attack from all points they thrust aside 
<A NAME="179"></A>all who resisted, pressed fiercely on their retreat, driving them before 
<A NAME="180"></A>them, when they rallied in compact array, some by close fighting, others 
<A NAME="181"></A>by missiles from a distance. Chariovalda, after long sustaining the enemy's 
<A NAME="182"></A>fury, cheered on his men to break by a dense formation the onset of their 
<A NAME="183"></A>bands, while he himself, plunging into the thickest of the battle, fell 
<A NAME="184"></A>amid a shower of darts with his horse pierced under him, and round him 
<A NAME="185"></A>many noble chiefs. The rest were rescued from the peril by their own strength, 
<A NAME="186"></A>or by the cavalry which came up with Stertinius and 
<A NAME="187"></A>Aemilius.
<A NAME="188"></A><BR><BR>Caesar on crossing the Visurgis learnt by the information of a 
<A NAME="189"></A>deserter that Arminius had chosen a battle-field, that other tribes too 
<A NAME="190"></A>had assembled in a forest sacred to Hercules, and would venture on a night 
<A NAME="191"></A>attack on his camp. He put faith in this intelligence, and, besides, several 
<A NAME="192"></A>watchfires were seen. Scouts also, who had crept close up to the enemy, 
<A NAME="193"></A>reported that they had heard the neighing of horses and the hum of a huge 
<A NAME="194"></A>and tumultuous host. And so as the decisive crisis drew near, that he ought 
<A NAME="195"></A>thoroughly to sound the temper of his soldiers, he considered with himself 
<A NAME="196"></A>how this was to be accomplished with a genuine result. Tribunes and centurions, 
<A NAME="197"></A>he knew, oftener reported what was welcome than what was true; freedmen 
<A NAME="198"></A>had slavish spirits, friends a love of flattery. If an assembly were called, 
<A NAME="199"></A>there too the lead of a few was followed by the shout of the many. He must 
<A NAME="200"></A>probe their inmost thoughts, when they were uttering their hopes and fears 
<A NAME="201"></A>at the military mess, among themselves, and unwatched.
<A NAME="202"></A><BR><BR>At nightfall, leaving his tent of augury by a secret exit, unknown 
<A NAME="203"></A>to the sentries, with one companion, his shoulders covered with a wild 
<A NAME="204"></A>beast's skin, he visited the camp streets, stood by the tents, and enjoyed 
<A NAME="205"></A>the men's talk about himself, as one extolled his noble rank, another, 
<A NAME="206"></A>his handsome person, nearly all of them, his endurance, his gracious manner 
<A NAME="207"></A>and the evenness of his temper, whether he was jesting or was serious, 
<A NAME="208"></A>while they acknowledged that they ought to repay him with their gratitude 
<A NAME="209"></A>in battle, and at the same time sacrifice to a glorious vengeance the perfidious 
<A NAME="210"></A>violators of peace. Meanwhile one of the enemy, acquainted with the Roman 
<A NAME="211"></A>tongue, spurred his horse up to the entrenchments, and in a loud voice 
<A NAME="212"></A>promised in the name of Arminius to all deserters wives and lands with 
<A NAME="213"></A>daily pay of a hundred sesterces as long as war lasted. The insult fired 
<A NAME="214"></A>the wrath of the legions. "Let daylight come," they said, "let battle be 
<A NAME="215"></A>given. The soldiers will possess themselves of the lands of the Germans 
<A NAME="216"></A>and will carry off their wives. We hail the omen; we mean the women and 
<A NAME="217"></A>riches of the enemy to be our spoil." About midday there was a skirmishing 
<A NAME="218"></A>attack on our camp, without any discharge of missiles, when they saw the 
<A NAME="219"></A>cohorts in close array before the lines and no sign of 
<A NAME="220"></A>carelessness.
<A NAME="221"></A><BR><BR>The same night brought with it a cheering dream to Germanicus. 
<A NAME="222"></A>He saw himself engaged in sacrifice, and his robe being sprinkled with 
<A NAME="223"></A>the sacred blood, another more beautiful was given him by the hands of 
<A NAME="224"></A>his grandmother Augusta. Encouraged by the omen and finding the auspices 
<A NAME="225"></A>favourable, he called an assembly, and explained the precautions which 
<A NAME="226"></A>wisdom suggested as suitable for the impending battle. "It is not," he 
<A NAME="227"></A>said, "plains only which are good for the fighting of Roman soldiers, but 
<A NAME="228"></A>woods and forest passes, if science be used. For the huge shields and unwieldly 
<A NAME="229"></A>lances of the barbarians cannot, amid trunks of trees and brushwood that 
<A NAME="230"></A>springs from the ground, be so well managed as our javelins and swords 
<A NAME="231"></A>and closefitting armour. Shower your blows thickly; strike at the face 
<A NAME="232"></A>with your swords' points. The German has neither cuirass nor helmet; even 
<A NAME="233"></A>his shield is not strengthened with leather or steel, but is of osiers 
<A NAME="234"></A>woven together or of thin and painted board. If their first line is armed 
<A NAME="235"></A>with spears, the rest have only weapons hardened by fire or very short. 
<A NAME="236"></A>Again, though their frames are terrible to the eye and formidable in a 
<A NAME="237"></A>brief onset, they have no capacity of enduring wounds; without, any shame 
<A NAME="238"></A>at the disgrace, without any regard to their leaders, they quit the field 
<A NAME="239"></A>and flee; they quail under disaster, just as in success they forget alike 
<A NAME="240"></A>divine and human laws. If in your weariness of land and sea you desire 
<A NAME="241"></A>an end of service, this battle prepares the way to it. The Elbe is now 
<A NAME="242"></A>nearer than the Rhine, and there is no war beyond, provided only you enable 
<A NAME="243"></A>me, keeping close as I do to my father's and my uncle's footsteps, to stand 
<A NAME="244"></A>a conqueror on the same spot."
<A NAME="245"></A><BR><BR>The general's speech was followed by enthusiasm in the soldiers, 
<A NAME="246"></A>and the signal for battle was given. Nor were Arminius and the other German 
<A NAME="247"></A>chiefs slow to call their respective clansmen to witness that "these Romans 
<A NAME="248"></A>were the most cowardly fugitives out of Varus's army, men who rather than 
<A NAME="249"></A>endure war had taken to mutiny. Half of them have their backs covered with 
<A NAME="250"></A>wounds; half are once again exposing limbs battered by waves and storms 
<A NAME="251"></A>to a foe full of fury, and to hostile deities, with no hope of advantage. 
<A NAME="252"></A>They have, in fact, had recourse to a fleet and to a trackless ocean, that 
<A NAME="253"></A>their coming might be unopposed, their flight unpursued. But when once 
<A NAME="254"></A>they have joined conflict with us, the help of winds or oars will be unavailing 
<A NAME="255"></A>to the vanquished. Remember only their greed, their cruelty, their pride. 
<A NAME="256"></A>Is anything left for us but to retain our freedom or to die before we are 
<A NAME="257"></A>enslaved?
<A NAME="258"></A><BR><BR>When they were thus roused and were demanding battle, their chiefs 
<A NAME="259"></A>led them down into a plain named Idistavisus. It winds between the Visurgis 
<A NAME="260"></A>and a hill range, its breadth varying as the river banks recede or the 
<A NAME="261"></A>spurs of the hills project on it. In their rear rose a forest, with the 
<A NAME="262"></A>branches rising to a great height, while there were clear spaces between 
<A NAME="263"></A>the trunks. The barbarian army occupied the plain and the outskirts of 
<A NAME="264"></A>the wood. The Cherusci were posted by themselves on the high ground, so 
<A NAME="265"></A>as to rush down on the Romans during the battle.
<A NAME="266"></A><BR><BR>Our army advanced in the following order. The auxiliary Gauls and 
<A NAME="267"></A>Germans were in the van, then the foot-archers, after them, four legions 
<A NAME="268"></A>and Caesar himself with two praetorian cohorts and some picked cavalry. 
<A NAME="269"></A>Next came as many other legions, and light-armed troops with horse-bowmen, 
<A NAME="270"></A>and the remaining cohorts of the allies. The men were quite ready and prepared 
<A NAME="271"></A>to form in line of battle according to their marching 
<A NAME="272"></A>order.
<A NAME="273"></A><BR><BR>Caesar, as soon as he saw the Cheruscan bands which in their impetuous 
<A NAME="274"></A>spirit had rushed to the attack, ordered the finest of his cavalry to charge 
<A NAME="275"></A>them in flank, Stertinius with the other squadrons to make a detour and 
<A NAME="276"></A>fall on their rear, promising himself to come up in good time. Meanwhile 
<A NAME="277"></A>there was a most encouraging augury. Eight eagles, seen to fly towards 
<A NAME="278"></A>the woods and to enter them, caught the general's eye. "Go," he exclaimed, 
<A NAME="279"></A>"follow the Roman birds, the true deities of our legions." At the same 
<A NAME="280"></A>moment the infantry charged, and the cavalry which had been sent on in 
<A NAME="281"></A>advance dashed on the rear and the flanks. And, strange to relate, two 
<A NAME="282"></A>columns of the enemy fled in opposite directions, that, which had occupied 
<A NAME="283"></A>the wood, rushing into the open, those who had been drawn up on the plains, 
<A NAME="284"></A>into the wood. The Cherusci, who were between them, were dislodged from 
<A NAME="285"></A>the hills, while Arminius, conspicuous among them by gesture, voice, and 
<A NAME="286"></A>a wound he had received, kept up the fight. He had thrown himself on our 
<A NAME="287"></A>archers and was on the point of breaking through them, when the cohorts 
<A NAME="288"></A>of the Raeti, Vendelici, and Gauls faced his attack. By a strong bodily 
<A NAME="289"></A>effort, however, and a furious rush of his horse, he made his way through 
<A NAME="290"></A>them, having smeared his face with his blood, that he might not be known. 
<A NAME="291"></A>Some have said that he was recognised by Chauci serving among the Roman 
<A NAME="292"></A>auxiliaries, who let him go.
<A NAME="293"></A><BR><BR>Inguiomerus owed his escape to similar courage or treachery. The 
<A NAME="294"></A>rest were cut down in every direction. Many in attempting to swim across 
<A NAME="295"></A>the Visurgis were overwhelmed under a storm of missiles or by the force 
<A NAME="296"></A>of the current, lastly, by the rush of fugitives and the falling in of 
<A NAME="297"></A>the banks. Some in their ignominious flight climbed the tops of trees, 
<A NAME="298"></A>and as they were hiding themselves in the boughs, archers were brought 
<A NAME="299"></A>up and they were shot for sport. Others were dashed to the ground by the 
<A NAME="300"></A>felling of the trees.
<A NAME="301"></A><BR><BR>It was a great victory and without bloodshed to us. From nine in 
<A NAME="302"></A>the morning to nightfall the enemy were slaughtered, and ten miles were 
<A NAME="303"></A>covered with arms and dead bodies, while there were found amid the plunder 
<A NAME="304"></A>the chains which the Germans had brought with them for the Romans, as though 
<A NAME="305"></A>the issue were certain. The soldiers on the battle field hailed Tiberius 
<A NAME="306"></A>as Imperator, and raised a mound on which arms were piled in the style 
<A NAME="307"></A>of a trophy, with the names of the conquered tribes inscribed beneath 
<A NAME="308"></A>them.
<A NAME="309"></A><BR><BR>That sight caused keener grief and rage among the Germans than 
<A NAME="310"></A>their wounds, their mourning, and their losses. Those who but now were 
<A NAME="311"></A>preparing to quit their settlements and to retreat to the further side 
<A NAME="312"></A>of the Elbe, longed for battle and flew to arms. Common people and chiefs, 
<A NAME="313"></A>young and old, rushed on the Roman army, and spread disorder. At last they 
<A NAME="314"></A>chose a spot closed in by a river and by forests, within which was a narrow 
<A NAME="315"></A>swampy plain. The woods too were surrounded by a bottomless morass, only 
<A NAME="316"></A>on one side of it the Angrivarii had raised a broad earthwork, as a boundary 
<A NAME="317"></A>between themselves and the Cherusci. Here their infantry was ranged. Their 
<A NAME="318"></A>cavalry they concealed in neighbouring woods, so as to be on the legions' 
<A NAME="319"></A>rear, as soon as they entered the forest.
<A NAME="320"></A><BR><BR>All this was known to Caesar. He was acquainted with their plans, 
<A NAME="321"></A>their positions, with what met the eye, and what was hidden, and he prepared 
<A NAME="322"></A>to turn the enemy's stratagems to their own destruction. To Seius Tubero, 
<A NAME="323"></A>his chief officer, he assigned the cavalry and the plain. His infantry 
<A NAME="324"></A>he drew up so that part might advance on level ground into the forest, 
<A NAME="325"></A>and part clamber up the earthwork which confronted them. He charged himself 
<A NAME="326"></A>with what was the specially difficult operation, leaving the rest to his 
<A NAME="327"></A>officers. Those who had the level ground easily forced a passage. Those 
<A NAME="328"></A>who had to assault the earthwork encountered heavy blows from above, as 
<A NAME="329"></A>if they were scaling a wall. The general saw how unequal this close fighting 
<A NAME="330"></A>was, and having withdrawn his legions to a little distance, ordered the 
<A NAME="331"></A>slingers and artillerymen to discharge a volley of missiles and scatter 
<A NAME="332"></A>the enemy. Spears were hurled from the engines, and the more conspicuous 
<A NAME="333"></A>were the defenders of the position, the more the wounds with which they 
<A NAME="334"></A>were driven from it. Caesar with some praetorian cohorts was the first, 
<A NAME="335"></A>after the storming of the ramparts, to dash into the woods. There they 
<A NAME="336"></A>fought at close quarters. A morass was in the enemy's rear, and the Romans 
<A NAME="337"></A>were hemmed in by the river or by the hills. Both were in a desperate plight 
<A NAME="338"></A>from their position; valour was their only hope, victory their only 
<A NAME="339"></A>safety.
<A NAME="340"></A><BR><BR>The Germans were equally brave, but they were beaten by the nature 
<A NAME="341"></A>of the fighting and of the weapons, for their vast host in so confined 
<A NAME="342"></A>a space could neither thrust out nor recover their immense lances, or avail 
<A NAME="343"></A>themselves of their nimble movements and lithe frames, forced as they were 
<A NAME="344"></A>to a close engagement. Our soldiers, on the other hand, with their shields 
<A NAME="345"></A>pressed to their breasts, and their hands grasping their sword-hilts, struck 
<A NAME="346"></A>at the huge limbs and exposed faces of the barbarians, cutting a passage 
<A NAME="347"></A>through the slaughtered enemy, for Arminius was now less active, either 
<A NAME="348"></A>from incessant perils, or because he was partially disabled by his recent 
<A NAME="349"></A>wound. As for Inguiomerus, who flew hither and thither over the battlefield, 
<A NAME="350"></A>it was fortune rather than courage which forsook him. Germanicus, too, 
<A NAME="351"></A>that he might be the better known, took his helmet off his head and begged 
<A NAME="352"></A>his men to follow up the slaughter, as they wanted not prisoners, and the 
<A NAME="353"></A>utter destruction of the nation would be the only conclusion of the war. 
<A NAME="354"></A>And now, late in the day, he withdrew one of his legions from the field, 
<A NAME="355"></A>to intrench a camp, while the rest till nightfall glutted themselves with 
<A NAME="356"></A>the enemy's blood. Our cavalry fought with indecisive 
<A NAME="357"></A>success.
<A NAME="358"></A><BR><BR>Having publicly praised his victorious troops, Caesar raised a 
<A NAME="359"></A>pile of arms with the proud inscription, "The army of Tiberius Caesar, 
<A NAME="360"></A>after thoroughly conquering the tribes between the Rhine and the Elbe, 
<A NAME="361"></A>has dedicated this monument to Mars, Jupiter, and Augustus." He added nothing 
<A NAME="362"></A>about himself, fearing jealousy, or thinking that the conciousness of the 
<A NAME="363"></A>achievement was enough. Next he charged Stertinius with making war on the 
<A NAME="364"></A>Angrivarii, but they hastened to surrender. And, as suppliants, by refusing 
<A NAME="365"></A>nothing, they obtained a full pardon.
<A NAME="366"></A><BR><BR>When, however, summer was at its height some of the legions were 
<A NAME="367"></A>sent back overland into winter-quarters, but most of them Caesar put on 
<A NAME="368"></A>board the fleet and brought down the river Amisia to the ocean. At first 
<A NAME="369"></A>the calm waters merely sounded with the oars of a thousand vessels or were 
<A NAME="370"></A>ruffled by the sailing ships. Soon, a hailstorm bursting from a black mass 
<A NAME="371"></A>of clouds, while the waves rolled hither and thither under tempestuous 
<A NAME="372"></A>gales from every quarter, rendered clear sight impossible, and the steering 
<A NAME="373"></A>difficult, while our soldiers, terrorstricken and without any experience 
<A NAME="374"></A>of disasters on the sea, by embarrassing the sailors or giving them clumsy 
<A NAME="375"></A>aid, neutralized the services of the skilled crews. After a while, wind 
<A NAME="376"></A>and wave shifted wholly to the south, and from the hilly lands and deep 
<A NAME="377"></A>rivers of Germany came with a huge line of rolling clouds, a strong blast, 
<A NAME="378"></A>all the more frightful from the frozen north which was so near to them, 
<A NAME="379"></A>and instantly caught and drove the ships hither and thither into the open 
<A NAME="380"></A>ocean, or on islands with steep cliffs or which hidden shoals made perilous. 
<A NAME="381"></A>these they just escaped, with difficulty, and when the tide changed and 
<A NAME="382"></A>bore them the same way as the wind, they could not hold to their anchors 
<A NAME="383"></A>or bale out the water which rushed in upon them. Horses, beasts of burden, 
<A NAME="384"></A>baggage, were thrown overboard, in order to lighten the hulls which leaked 
<A NAME="385"></A>copiously through their sides, while the waves too dashed over 
<A NAME="386"></A>them.
<A NAME="387"></A><BR><BR>As the ocean is stormier than all other seas, and as Germany is 
<A NAME="388"></A>conspicuous for the terrors of its climate, so in novelty and extent did 
<A NAME="389"></A>this disaster transcend every other, for all around were hostile coasts, 
<A NAME="390"></A>or an expanse so vast and deep that it is thought to be the remotest shoreless 
<A NAME="391"></A>sea. Some of the vessels were swallowed up; many were wrecked on distant 
<A NAME="392"></A>islands, and the soldiers, finding there no form of human life, perished 
<A NAME="393"></A>of hunger, except some who supported existence on carcases of horses washed 
<A NAME="394"></A>on the same shores. Germanicus's trireme alone reached the country of the 
<A NAME="395"></A>Chauci. Day and night, on those rocks and promontories he would incessantly 
<A NAME="396"></A>exclaim that he was himself responsible for this awful ruin, and friends 
<A NAME="397"></A>scarce restrained him from seeking death in the same 
<A NAME="398"></A>sea.
<A NAME="399"></A><BR><BR>At last, as the tide ebbed and the wind blew favourably, the shattered 
<A NAME="400"></A>vessels with but few rowers, or clothing spread as sails, some towed by 
<A NAME="401"></A>the more powerful, returned, and Germanicus, having speedily repaired them, 
<A NAME="402"></A>sent them to search the islands. Many by that means were recovered. The 
<A NAME="403"></A>Angrivarii, who had lately been admitted to our alliance, restored to us 
<A NAME="404"></A>several had ransomed from the inland tribes. Some had been carried to Britain 
<A NAME="405"></A>and were sent back by the petty chiefs. Every one, as he returned from 
<A NAME="406"></A>some far-distant region, told of wonders, of violent hurricanes, and unknown 
<A NAME="407"></A>birds, of monsters of the sea, of forms half-human, half beast-like, things 
<A NAME="408"></A>they had really seen or in their terror believed.
<A NAME="409"></A><BR><BR>Meanwhile the rumoured loss of the fleet stirred the Germans to 
<A NAME="410"></A>hope for war, as it did Caesar to hold them down. He ordered Caius Silius 
<A NAME="411"></A>with thirty thousand infantry and three thousand cavalry to march against 
<A NAME="412"></A>the Chatti. He himself, with a larger army, invaded the Marsi, whose leader, 
<A NAME="413"></A>Mallovendus, whom we had lately admitted to surrender, pointed out a neighbouring 
<A NAME="414"></A>wood, where, he said, an eagle of one of Varus's legions was buried and 
<A NAME="415"></A>guarded only by a small force. Immediately troops were despatched to draw 
<A NAME="416"></A>the enemy from his position by appearing in his front, others, to hem in 
<A NAME="417"></A>his rear and open the ground. Fortune favoured both. So Germanicus, with 
<A NAME="418"></A>increased energy, advanced into the country, laying it waste, and utterly 
<A NAME="419"></A>ruining a foe who dared not encounter him, or who was instantly defeated 
<A NAME="420"></A>wherever he resisted, and, as we learnt from prisoners, was never more 
<A NAME="421"></A>panic-stricken. The Romans, they declared, were invincible, rising superior 
<A NAME="422"></A>to all calamities; for having thrown away a fleet, having lost their arms, 
<A NAME="423"></A>after strewing the shores with the carcases of horses and of men, they 
<A NAME="424"></A>had rushed to the attack with the same courage, with equal spirit, and, 
<A NAME="425"></A>seemingly, with augmented numbers.
<A NAME="426"></A><BR><BR>The soldiers were then led back into winter-quarters, rejoicing 
<A NAME="427"></A>in their hearts at having been compensated for their disasters at sea by 
<A NAME="428"></A>a successful expedition. They were helped too by Caesar's bounty, which 
<A NAME="429"></A>made good whatever loss any one declared he had suffered. It was also regarded 
<A NAME="430"></A>as a certainty that the enemy were wavering and consulting on negotiations 
<A NAME="431"></A>for peace, and that, with an additional campaign next summer the war might 
<A NAME="432"></A>be ended. Tiberius, however, in repeated letters advised Germanicus to 
<A NAME="433"></A>return for the triumph decreed him. "He had now had enough of success, 
<A NAME="434"></A>enough of disaster. He had fought victorious battles on a great scale; 
<A NAME="435"></A>he should also remember those losses which the winds and waves had inflicted, 
<A NAME="436"></A>and which, though due to no fault of the general, were still grievous and 
<A NAME="437"></A>shocking. He, Tiberius, had himself been sent nine times by Augustus into 
<A NAME="438"></A>Germany, and had done more by policy than by arms. By this means the submission 
<A NAME="439"></A>of the Sugambri had been secured, and the Suevi with their king Maroboduus 
<A NAME="440"></A>had been forced into peace. The Cherusci too and the other insurgent tribes, 
<A NAME="441"></A>since the vengeance of Rome had been satisfied, might be left to their 
<A NAME="442"></A>internal feuds."
<A NAME="443"></A><BR><BR>When Germanicus requested a year for the completion of his enterprise, 
<A NAME="444"></A>Tiberius put a severer pressure on his modesty by offering him a second 
<A NAME="445"></A>consulship, the functions of which he was to discharge in person. He also 
<A NAME="446"></A>added that if war must still be waged, he might as well leave some materials 
<A NAME="447"></A>for renown to his brother Drusus, who, as there was then no other enemy, 
<A NAME="448"></A>could win only in Germany the imperial title and the triumphal laurel. 
<A NAME="449"></A>Germanicus hesitated no longer, though he saw that this was a pretence, 
<A NAME="450"></A>and that he was hurried away through jealousy from the glory he had already 
<A NAME="451"></A>acquired.
<A NAME="452"></A><BR><BR>About the same time Libo Drusus, of the family of Scribonii, was 
<A NAME="453"></A>accused of revolutionary schemes. I will explain, somewhat minutely, the 
<A NAME="454"></A>beginning, progress, and end of this affair, since then first were originated 
<A NAME="455"></A>those practices which for so many years have eaten into the heart of the 
<A NAME="456"></A>State. Firmius Catus, a senator, an intimate friend of Libo's, prompted 
<A NAME="457"></A>the young man, who was thoughtless and an easy prey to delusions, to resort 
<A NAME="458"></A>to astrologers' promises, magical rites, and interpreters of dreams, dwelling 
<A NAME="459"></A>ostentatiously on his great-grandfather Pompeius, his aunt Scribonia, who 
<A NAME="460"></A>had formerly been wife of Augustus, his imperial cousins, his house crowded 
<A NAME="461"></A>with ancestral busts, and urging him to extravagance and debt, himself 
<A NAME="462"></A>the companion of his profligacy and desperate embarrassments, thereby to 
<A NAME="463"></A>entangle him in all the more proofs of guilt.
<A NAME="464"></A><BR><BR>As soon as he found enough witnesses, with some slaves who knew 
<A NAME="465"></A>the facts, he begged an audience of the emperor, after first indicating 
<A NAME="466"></A>the crime and the criminal through Flaccus Vescularius, a Roman knight, 
<A NAME="467"></A>who was more intimate with Tiberius than himself. Caesar, without disregarding 
<A NAME="468"></A>the information, declined an interview, for the communication, he said, 
<A NAME="469"></A>might be conveyed to him through the same messenger, Flaccus. Meanwhile 
<A NAME="470"></A>he conferred the praetorship on Libo and often invited him to his table, 
<A NAME="471"></A>showing no unfriendliness in his looks or anger in his words (so thoroughly 
<A NAME="472"></A>had he concealed his resentment); and he wished to know all his saying 
<A NAME="473"></A>and doings, though it was in his power to stop them, till one Junius, who 
<A NAME="474"></A>had been tampered with by Libo for the purpose of evoking by incantations 
<A NAME="475"></A>spirits of the dead, gave information to Fulcinius Trio. Trio's ability 
<A NAME="476"></A>was conspicuous among informers, as well as his eagerness for an evil notoriety. 
<A NAME="477"></A>He at once pounced on the accused, went to the consuls, and demanded an 
<A NAME="478"></A>inquiry before the Senate. The Senators were summoned, with a special notice 
<A NAME="479"></A>that they must consult on a momentous and terrible matter.
<A NAME="480"></A><BR><BR>Libo meanwhile, in mourning apparel and accompanied by ladies of 
<A NAME="481"></A>the highest rank, went to house after house, entreating his relatives, 
<A NAME="482"></A>and imploring some eloquent voice to ward off his perils; which all refused, 
<A NAME="483"></A>on different pretexts, but from the same apprehension. On the day the Senate 
<A NAME="484"></A>met, jaded with fear and mental anguish, or, as some have related, feigning 
<A NAME="485"></A>illness, he was carried in a litter to the doors of the Senate House, and 
<A NAME="486"></A>leaning on his brother he raised his hands and voice in supplication to 
<A NAME="487"></A>Tiberius, who received him with unmoved countenance. The emperor then read 
<A NAME="488"></A>out the charges and the accusers' names, with such calmness as not to seem 
<A NAME="489"></A>to soften or aggravate the accusations.
<A NAME="490"></A><BR><BR>Besides Trio and Catus, Fonteius Agrippa and Caius Vibius were 
<A NAME="491"></A>among his accusers, and claimed with eager rivalry the privilege of conducting 
<A NAME="492"></A>the case for the prosecution, till Vibius, as they would not yield one 
<A NAME="493"></A>to the other, and Libo had entered without counsel, offered to state the 
<A NAME="494"></A>charges against him singly, and produced an extravagantly absurd accusation, 
<A NAME="495"></A>according to which Libo had consulted persons whether he would have such 
<A NAME="496"></A>wealth as to be able to cover the Appian road as far as Brundisium with 
<A NAME="497"></A>money. There were other questions of the same sort, quite senseless and 
<A NAME="498"></A>idle; if leniently regarded, pitiable. But there was one paper in Libo's 
<A NAME="499"></A>handwriting, so the prosecutor alleged, with the names of Caesars and of 
<A NAME="500"></A>Senators, to which marks were affixed of dreadful or mysterious significance. 
<A NAME="501"></A>When the accused denied this, it was decided that his slaves who recognised 
<A NAME="502"></A>the writing should be examined by torture. As an ancient statute of the 
<A NAME="503"></A>Senate forbade such inquiry in a case affecting a master's life, Tiberius, 
<A NAME="504"></A>with his cleverness in devising new law, ordered Libo's slaves to be sold 
<A NAME="505"></A>singly to the State-agent, so that, forsooth, without an infringement of 
<A NAME="506"></A>the Senate's decree, Libo might be tried on their evidence. As a consequence, 
<A NAME="507"></A>the defendant asked an adjournment till next day, and having gone home 
<A NAME="508"></A>he charged his kinsman, Publius Quirinus, with his last prayer to the 
<A NAME="509"></A>emperor.
<A NAME="510"></A><BR><BR>The answer was that he should address himself to the Senate. Meanwhile 
<A NAME="511"></A>his house was surrounded with soldiers; they crowded noisily even about 
<A NAME="512"></A>the entrance, so that they could be heard and seen; when Libo, whose anguish 
<A NAME="513"></A>drove him from the very banquet he had prepared as his last gratification, 
<A NAME="514"></A>called for a minister of death, grasped the hands of his slaves, and thrust 
<A NAME="515"></A>a sword into them. In their confusion, as they shrank back, they overturned 
<A NAME="516"></A>the lamp on the table at his side, and in the darkness, now to him the 
<A NAME="517"></A>gloom of death, he aimed two blows at a vital part. At the groans of the 
<A NAME="518"></A>falling man his freedmen hurried up, and the soldiers, seeing the bloody 
<A NAME="519"></A>deed, stood aloof. Yet the prosecution was continued in the Senate with 
<A NAME="520"></A>the same persistency, and Tiberius declared on oath that he would have 
<A NAME="521"></A>interceded for his life, guilty though he was, but for his hasty 
<A NAME="522"></A>suicide.
<A NAME="523"></A><BR><BR>His property was divided among his accusers, and praetorships out 
<A NAME="524"></A>of the usual order were conferred on those who were of senators' rank. 
<A NAME="525"></A>Cotta Messalinus then proposed that Libo's bust should not be carried in 
<A NAME="526"></A>the funeral procession of any of his descendants; and Cneius Lentulus, 
<A NAME="527"></A>that no Scribonius should assume the surname of Drusus. Days of public 
<A NAME="528"></A>thanksgiving were appointed on the suggestion of Pomponius Flaccus. Offerings 
<A NAME="529"></A>were given to Jupiter, Mars, and Concord, and the 13th day of September, 
<A NAME="530"></A>on which Libo had killed himself, was to be observed as a festival, on 
<A NAME="531"></A>the motion of Gallus Asinius, Papius Mutilus, and Lucius Apronius. I have 
<A NAME="532"></A>mentioned the proposals and sycophancy of these men, in order to bring 
<A NAME="533"></A>to light this old-standing evil in the State.
<A NAME="534"></A><BR><BR>Decrees of the Senate were also passed to expel from Italy astrologers 
<A NAME="535"></A>and magicians. One of their number, Lucius Pituanius, was hurled from the 
<A NAME="536"></A>Rock. Another, Publius Marcius, was executed, according to ancient custom, 
<A NAME="537"></A>by the consuls outside the Esquiline Gate, after the trumpets had been 
<A NAME="538"></A>bidden to sound.
<A NAME="539"></A><BR><BR>On the next day of the Senate's meeting much was said against the 
<A NAME="540"></A>luxury of the country by Quintus Haterius, an ex-consul, and by Octavius 
<A NAME="541"></A>Fronto, an ex-praetor. It was decided that vessels of solid gold should 
<A NAME="542"></A>not be made for the serving of food, and that men should not disgrace themselves 
<A NAME="543"></A>with silken clothing from the East. Fronto went further, and insisted on 
<A NAME="544"></A>restrictions being put on plate, furniture, and household establishments. 
<A NAME="545"></A>It was indeed still usual with the Senators, when it was their turn to 
<A NAME="546"></A>vote, to suggest anything they thought for the State's advantage. Gallus 
<A NAME="547"></A>Asinius argued on the other side. "With the growth of the empire private 
<A NAME="548"></A>wealth too," he said, "had increased, and there was nothing new in this, 
<A NAME="549"></A>but it accorded with the fashions of the earliest antiquity. Riches were 
<A NAME="550"></A>one thing with the Fabricii, quite another with the Scipios. The State 
<A NAME="551"></A>was the standard of everything; when it was poor, the homes of the citizens 
<A NAME="552"></A>were humble; when it reached such magnificence, private grandeur increased. 
<A NAME="553"></A>In household establishments, and plate, and in whatever was provided for 
<A NAME="554"></A>use, there was neither excess nor parsimony except in relation to the fortune 
<A NAME="555"></A>of the possessor. A distinction had been made in the assessments of Senators 
<A NAME="556"></A>and knights, not because they differed naturally, but that the superiority 
<A NAME="557"></A>of the one class in places in the theatre, in rank and in honour, might 
<A NAME="558"></A>be also maintained in everything else which insured mental repose and bodily 
<A NAME="559"></A>recreation, unless indeed men in the highest position were to undergo more 
<A NAME="560"></A>anxieties and more dangers, and to be at the same time deprived of all 
<A NAME="561"></A>solace under those anxieties and dangers." Gallus gained a ready assent, 
<A NAME="562"></A>under these specious phrases, by a confession of failings with which his 
<A NAME="563"></A>audience symphathised. And Tiberius too had added that this was not a time 
<A NAME="564"></A>for censorship, and that if there were any declension in manners, a promoter 
<A NAME="565"></A>of reform would not be wanting.
<A NAME="566"></A><BR><BR>During this debate Lucius Piso, after exclaiming against the corruption 
<A NAME="567"></A>of the courts, the bribery of judges, the cruel threats of accusations 
<A NAME="568"></A>from hired orators, declared that he would depart and quit the capital, 
<A NAME="569"></A>and that he meant to live in some obscure and distant rural retreat. At 
<A NAME="570"></A>the same moment he rose to leave the Senate House. Tiberius was much excited, 
<A NAME="571"></A>and though he pacified Piso with gentle words, he also strongly urged his 
<A NAME="572"></A>relatives to stop his departure by their influence or their 
<A NAME="573"></A>entreaties.
<A NAME="574"></A><BR><BR>Soon afterwards this same Piso gave an equal proof of a fearless 
<A NAME="575"></A>sense of wrong by suing Urgulania, whom Augusta's friendship had raised 
<A NAME="576"></A>above the law. Neither did Urgulania obey the summons, for in defiance 
<A NAME="577"></A>of Piso she went in her litter to the emperor's house; nor did Piso give 
<A NAME="578"></A>way, though Augusta complained that she was insulted and her majesty slighted. 
<A NAME="579"></A>Tiberius, to win popularity by so humouring his mother as to say that he 
<A NAME="580"></A>would go to the praetor's court and support Urgulania, went forth from 
<A NAME="581"></A>the palace, having ordered soldiers to follow him at a distance. He was 
<A NAME="582"></A>seen, as the people thronged about him, to wear a calm face, while he prolonged 
<A NAME="583"></A>his time on the way with various conversations, till at last when Piso's 
<A NAME="584"></A>relatives tried in vain to restrain him, Augusta directed the money which 
<A NAME="585"></A>was claimed to be handed to him. This ended the affair, and Piso, in consequence, 
<A NAME="586"></A>was not dishonoured, and the emperor rose in reputation. Urgulania's influence, 
<A NAME="587"></A>however, was so formidable to the State, that in a certain cause which 
<A NAME="588"></A>was tried by the Senate she would not condescend to appear as a witness. 
<A NAME="589"></A>The praetor was sent to question her at her own house, although the Vestal 
<A NAME="590"></A>virgins, according to ancient custom, were heard in the courts, before 
<A NAME="591"></A>judges, whenever they gave evidence.
<A NAME="592"></A><BR><BR>I should say nothing of the adjournment of public business in this 
<A NAME="593"></A>year, if it were not worth while to notice the conflicting opinions of 
<A NAME="594"></A>Cneius Piso and Asinius Gallus on the subject. Piso, although the emperor 
<A NAME="595"></A>had said that he would be absent, held that all the more ought the business 
<A NAME="596"></A>to be transacted, that the State might have honour of its Senate and knights 
<A NAME="597"></A>being able to perform their duties in the sovereign's absence. Gallus, 
<A NAME="598"></A>as Piso had forestalled him in the display of freedom, maintained that 
<A NAME="599"></A>nothing was sufficiently impressive or suitable to the majesty of the Roman 
<A NAME="600"></A>people, unless done before Caesar and under his very eyes, and that therefore 
<A NAME="601"></A>the gathering from all Italy and the influx from the provinces ought to 
<A NAME="602"></A>be reserved for his presence. Tiberius listened to this in silence, and 
<A NAME="603"></A>the matter was debated on both sides in a sharp controversy. The business, 
<A NAME="604"></A>however, was adjourned.
<A NAME="605"></A><BR><BR>A dispute then arose between Gallus and the emperor. Gallus proposed 
<A NAME="606"></A>that the elections of magistrates should be held every five years, and 
<A NAME="607"></A>that the commanders of the legions who before receiving a praetorship discharged 
<A NAME="608"></A>this military service should at once become praetorselect, the emperor 
<A NAME="609"></A>nominating twelve candidates every year. It was quite evident that this 
<A NAME="610"></A>motion had a deeper meaning and was an attempt to explore the secrets of 
<A NAME="611"></A>imperial policy. Tiberius, however, argued as if his power would be thus 
<A NAME="612"></A>increased. "It would," he said, "be trying to his moderation to have to 
<A NAME="613"></A>elect so many and to put off so many. He scarcely avoided giving offence 
<A NAME="614"></A>from year to year, even though a candidate's rejection was solaced by the 
<A NAME="615"></A>near prospect of office. What hatred would be incurred from those whose 
<A NAME="616"></A>election was deferred for five years! How could he foresee through so long 
<A NAME="617"></A>an interval what would be a man's temper, or domestic relations, or estate? 
<A NAME="618"></A>Men became arrogant even with this annual appointment. What would happen 
<A NAME="619"></A>if their thoughts were fixed on promotion for five years? It was in fact 
<A NAME="620"></A>a multiplying of the magistrates five-fold, and a subversion of the laws 
<A NAME="621"></A>which had prescribed proper periods for the exercise of the candidate's 
<A NAME="622"></A>activity and the seeking or securing office. With this seemingly conciliatory 
<A NAME="623"></A>speech he retained the substance of power.
<A NAME="624"></A><BR><BR>He also increased the incomes of some of the Senators. Hence it 
<A NAME="625"></A>was the more surprising that he listened somewhat disdainfully to the request 
<A NAME="626"></A>of Marcus Hortalus, a youth of noble rank in conspicuous poverty. He was 
<A NAME="627"></A>the grandson of the orator Hortensius, and had been induced by Augustus, 
<A NAME="628"></A>on the strength of a gift of a million sesterces, to marry and rear children, 
<A NAME="629"></A>that one of our most illustrious families might not become extinct. Accordingly, 
<A NAME="630"></A>with his four sons standing at the doors of the Senate House, the Senate 
<A NAME="631"></A>then sitting in the palace, when it was his turn to speak he began to address 
<A NAME="632"></A>them as follows, his eyes fixed now on the statue of Hortensius which stood 
<A NAME="633"></A>among those of the orators, now on that of Augustus:- "Senators, these 
<A NAME="634"></A>whose numbers and boyish years you behold I have reared, not by my own 
<A NAME="635"></A>choice, but because the emperor advised me. At the same time, my ancestors 
<A NAME="636"></A>deserved to have descendants. For myself, not having been able in these 
<A NAME="637"></A>altered times to receive or acquire wealth or popular favour, or that eloquence 
<A NAME="638"></A>which has been the hereditary possession of our house, I was satisfied 
<A NAME="639"></A>if my narrow means were neither a disgrace to myself nor burden to others. 
<A NAME="640"></A>At the emperor's bidding I married. Behold the offspring and progeny of 
<A NAME="641"></A>a succession of consuls and dictators. Not to excite odium do I recall 
<A NAME="642"></A>such facts, but to win compassion. While you prosper, Caesar, they will 
<A NAME="643"></A>attain such promotion as you shall bestow. Meanwhile save from penury the 
<A NAME="644"></A>great-grandsons of Quintus Hortensius, the foster-children of 
<A NAME="645"></A>Augustus."
<A NAME="646"></A><BR><BR>The Senate's favourable bias was an incitement to Tiberius to offer 
<A NAME="647"></A>prompt opposition, which he did in nearly these words:- "If all poor men 
<A NAME="648"></A>begin to come here and to beg money for their children, individuals will 
<A NAME="649"></A>never be satisfied, and the State will be bankrupt. Certainly our ancestors 
<A NAME="650"></A>did not grant the privilege of occasionally proposing amendments or of 
<A NAME="651"></A>suggesting, in our turn for speaking, something for the general advantage 
<A NAME="652"></A>in order that we might in this house increase our private business and 
<A NAME="653"></A>property, thereby bringing odium on the Senate and on emperors whether 
<A NAME="654"></A>they concede or refuse their bounty. In fact, it is not a request, but 
<A NAME="655"></A>an importunity, as utterly unreasonable as it is unforeseen, for a senator, 
<A NAME="656"></A>when the house has met on other matters, to rise from his place and, pleading 
<A NAME="657"></A>the number and age of his children, put a pressure on the delicacy of the 
<A NAME="658"></A>Senate, then transfer the same constraint to myself, and, as it were, break 
<A NAME="659"></A>open the exchequer, which, if we exhaust it by improper favouritism, will 
<A NAME="660"></A>have to be replenished by crimes. Money was given you, Hortalus, by Augustus, 
<A NAME="661"></A>but without solicitation, and not on the condition of its being always 
<A NAME="662"></A>given. Otherwise industry will languish and idleness be encouraged, if 
<A NAME="663"></A>a man has nothing to fear, nothing to hope from himself, and every one, 
<A NAME="664"></A>in utter recklessness, will expect relief from others, thus becoming useless 
<A NAME="665"></A>to himself and a burden to me."
<A NAME="666"></A><BR><BR>These and like remarks, though listened to with assent by those 
<A NAME="667"></A>who make it a practice to eulogise everything coming from sovereigns, both 
<A NAME="668"></A>good and bad, were received by the majority in silence or with suppressed 
<A NAME="669"></A>murmurs. Tiberius perceived it, and having paused a while, said that he 
<A NAME="670"></A>had given Hortalus his answer, but that if the senators thought it right, 
<A NAME="671"></A>he would bestow two hundred thousand sesterces on each of his children 
<A NAME="672"></A>of the male sex. The others thanked him; Hortalus said nothing, either 
<A NAME="673"></A>from alarm or because even in his reduced fortunes he clung to his hereditary 
<A NAME="674"></A>nobility. Nor did Tiberius afterwards show any pity, though the house of 
<A NAME="675"></A>Hortensius sank into shameful poverty.
<A NAME="676"></A><BR><BR>That same year the daring of a single slave, had it not been promptly 
<A NAME="677"></A>checked, would have ruined the State by discord and civil war. A servant 
<A NAME="678"></A>of Postumus Agrippa, Clemens by name, having ascertained that Augustus 
<A NAME="679"></A>was dead, formed a design beyond a slave's conception, of going to the 
<A NAME="680"></A>island of Planasia and seizing Agrippa by craft or force and bringing him 
<A NAME="681"></A>to the armies of Germany. The slowness of a merchant vessel thwarted his 
<A NAME="682"></A>bold venture. Meanwhile the murder of Agrippa had been perpetrated, and 
<A NAME="683"></A>then turning his thoughts to a greater and more hazardous enterprise, he 
<A NAME="684"></A>stole the ashes of the deceased, sailed to Cosa, a promontory of Etruria, 
<A NAME="685"></A>and there hid himself in obscure places till his hair and beard were long. 
<A NAME="686"></A>In age and figure he was not unlike his master. Then through suitable emissaries 
<A NAME="687"></A>who shared his secret, it was rumoured that Agrippa was alive, first in 
<A NAME="688"></A>whispered gossip, soon, as is usual with forbidden topics, in vague talk 
<A NAME="689"></A>which found its way to the credulous ears of the most ignorant people or 
<A NAME="690"></A>of restless and revolutionary schemers. He himself went to the towns, as 
<A NAME="691"></A>the day grew dark, without letting himself be seen publicly or remaining 
<A NAME="692"></A>long in the same places, but, as he knew that truth gains strength by notoriety 
<A NAME="693"></A>and time, falsehood by precipitancy and vagueness, he would either withdraw 
<A NAME="694"></A>himself from publicity or else forestall it.
<A NAME="695"></A><BR><BR>It was rumoured meanwhile throughout Italy, and was believed at 
<A NAME="696"></A>Rome, that Agrippa had been saved by the blessing of Heaven. Already at 
<A NAME="697"></A>Ostia, where he had arrived, he was the centre of interest to a vast concourse 
<A NAME="698"></A>as well as to secret gatherings in the capital, while Tiberius was distracted 
<A NAME="699"></A>by the doubt whether he should crush this slave of his by military force 
<A NAME="700"></A>or allow time to dissipate a silly credulity. Sometimes he thought that 
<A NAME="701"></A>he must overlook nothing, sometimes that he need not be afraid of everything, 
<A NAME="702"></A>his mind fluctuating between shame and terror. At last he entrusted the 
<A NAME="703"></A>affair to Sallustius Crispus, who chose two of his dependants (some say 
<A NAME="704"></A>they were soldiers) and urged them to go to him as pretended accomplices, 
<A NAME="705"></A>offering money and promising faithful companionship in danger. They did 
<A NAME="706"></A>as they were bidden; then, waiting for an unguarded hour of night, they 
<A NAME="707"></A>took with them a sufficient force, and having bound and gagged him, dragged 
<A NAME="708"></A>him to the palace. When Tiberius asked him how he had become Agrippa, he 
<A NAME="709"></A>is said to have replied, "As you became Caesar." He could not be forced 
<A NAME="710"></A>to divulge his accomplices. Tiberius did not venture on a public execution, 
<A NAME="711"></A>but ordered him to be slain in a private part of the palace and his body 
<A NAME="712"></A>to be secretly removed. And although many of the emperor's household and 
<A NAME="713"></A>knights and senators were said to have supported him with their wealth 
<A NAME="714"></A>and helped him with their counsels, no inquiry was made.
<A NAME="715"></A><BR><BR>At the close of the year was consecrated an arch near the temple 
<A NAME="716"></A>of Saturn to commemorate the recovery of the standards lost with Varus, 
<A NAME="717"></A>under the leadership of Germanicus and the auspices of Tiberius; a temple 
<A NAME="718"></A>of Fors Fortuna, by the Tiber, in the gardens which Caesar, the dictator, 
<A NAME="719"></A>bequeathed to the Roman people; a chapel to the Julian family, and statues 
<A NAME="720"></A>at Bovillae to the Divine Augustus.
<A NAME="721"></A><BR><BR>In the consulship of Caius Caecilius and Lucius Pomponius, Germanicus 
<A NAME="722"></A>Caesar, on the 26th day of May, celebrated his triumph over the Cherusci, 
<A NAME="723"></A>Chatti, and Angrivarii, and the other tribes which extend as far as the 
<A NAME="724"></A>Elbe. There were borne in procession spoils, prisoners, representations 
<A NAME="725"></A>of the mountains, the rivers and battles; and the war, seeing that he had 
<A NAME="726"></A>been forbidden to finish it, was taken as finished. The admiration of the 
<A NAME="727"></A>beholders was heightened by the striking comeliness of the general and 
<A NAME="728"></A>the chariot which bore his five children. Still, there was a latent dread 
<A NAME="729"></A>when they remembered how unfortunate in the case of Drusus, his father, 
<A NAME="730"></A>had been the favour of the crowd; how his uncle Marcellus, regarded by 
<A NAME="731"></A>the city populace with passionate enthusiasm, had been snatched from them 
<A NAME="732"></A>while yet a youth, and how short-lived and ill-starred were the attachments 
<A NAME="733"></A>of the Roman people.
<A NAME="734"></A><BR><BR>Tiberius meanwhile in the name of Germanicus gave every one of 
<A NAME="735"></A>the city populace three hundred sesterces, and nominated himself his colleague 
<A NAME="736"></A>in the consulship. Still, failing to obtain credit for sincere affection, 
<A NAME="737"></A>he resolved to get the young prince out of the way, under pretence of conferring 
<A NAME="738"></A>distinction, and for this he invented reasons, or eagerly fastened on such 
<A NAME="739"></A>as chance presented.
<A NAME="740"></A><BR><BR>King Archelaus had been in possession of Cappadocia for fifty years, 
<A NAME="741"></A>and Tiberius hated him because he had not shown him any mark of respect 
<A NAME="742"></A>while he was at Rhodes. This neglect of Archelaus was not due to pride, 
<A NAME="743"></A>but was suggested by the intimate friends of Augustus, because, when Caius 
<A NAME="744"></A>Caesar was in his prime and had charge of the affairs of the East, Tiberius's 
<A NAME="745"></A>friendship was thought to be dangerous. When, after the extinction of the 
<A NAME="746"></A>family of the Caesars, Tiberius acquired the empire, he enticed Archelaus 
<A NAME="747"></A>by a letter from his mother, who without concealing her son's displeasure 
<A NAME="748"></A>promised mercy if he would come to beg for it. Archelaus, either quite 
<A NAME="749"></A>unsuspicious of treachery, or dreading compulsion, should it be thought 
<A NAME="750"></A>that he saw through it, hastened to Rome. There he was received by a pitiless 
<A NAME="751"></A>emperor, and soon afterwards was arraigned before the Senate. In his anguish 
<A NAME="752"></A>and in the weariness of old age, and from being unused, as a king, to equality, 
<A NAME="753"></A>much less to degradation, not, certainly, from fear of the charges fabricated 
<A NAME="754"></A>against him, he ended his life, by his own act or by a natural death. His 
<A NAME="755"></A>kingdom was reduced into a province, and Caesar declared that, with its 
<A NAME="756"></A>revenues, the one per cent. tax could be lightened, which, for the future, 
<A NAME="757"></A>he fixed at one-half per cent.
<A NAME="758"></A><BR><BR>During the same time, on the deaths of Antiochus and Philopator, 
<A NAME="759"></A>kings respectively of the Commageni and Cilicians, these nations became 
<A NAME="760"></A>excited, a majority desiring the Roman rule, some, that of their kings. 
<A NAME="761"></A>The provinces too of Syria and Judaea, exhausted by their burdens, implored 
<A NAME="762"></A>a reduction of tribute.
<A NAME="763"></A><BR><BR>Tiberius accordingly discussed these matters and the affairs of 
<A NAME="764"></A>Armenia, which I have already related, before the Senate. "The commotions 
<A NAME="765"></A>in the East," he said, "could be quieted only by the wisdom, of Germanicus; 
<A NAME="766"></A>own life was on the decline, and Drusus had not yet reached his maturity." 
<A NAME="767"></A>Thereupon, by a decree of the Senate, the provinces beyond sea were entrusted 
<A NAME="768"></A>to Germanicus, with greater powers wherever he went than were given to 
<A NAME="769"></A>those who obtained their provinces by lot or by the emperor's 
<A NAME="770"></A>appointment.
<A NAME="771"></A><BR><BR>Tiberius had however removed from Syria Creticus Silanus, who was 
<A NAME="772"></A>connected by a close tie with Germanicus, his daughter being betrothed 
<A NAME="773"></A>to Nero, the eldest of Germanicus's children. He appointed to it Cneius 
<A NAME="774"></A>Piso, a man of violent temper, without an idea of obedience, with indeed 
<A NAME="775"></A>a natural arrogance inherited from his father Piso, who in the civil war 
<A NAME="776"></A>supported with the most energetic aid against Caesar the reviving faction 
<A NAME="777"></A>in Africa, then embraced the cause of Brutus and Cassius, and, when suffered 
<A NAME="778"></A>to return, refrained from seeking promotion till, he was actually solicited 
<A NAME="779"></A>to accept a consulship offered by Augustus. But beside the father's haughty 
<A NAME="780"></A>temper there was also the noble rank and wealth of his wife Plancina, to 
<A NAME="781"></A>inflame his ambition. He would hardly be the inferior of Tiberius, and 
<A NAME="782"></A>as for Tiberius's children, he looked down on them as far beneath him. 
<A NAME="783"></A>He thought it a certainty that he had been chosen to govern Syria in order 
<A NAME="784"></A>to thwart the aspirations of Germanicus. Some believed that he had even 
<A NAME="785"></A>received secret instructions from Tiberius, and it was beyond a question 
<A NAME="786"></A>that Augusta, with feminine jealousy, had suggested to Plancina calumnious 
<A NAME="787"></A>insinuations against Agrippina. For there was division and discord in the 
<A NAME="788"></A>court, with unexpressed partialities towards either Drusus or Germanicus. 
<A NAME="789"></A>Tiberius favoured Drusus, as his. son and born of his own blood. As for 
<A NAME="790"></A>Germanicus, his uncle's estrangement had increased the affection which 
<A NAME="791"></A>all others felt for him, and there was the fact too that he had an advantage 
<A NAME="792"></A>in the illustrious rank of his mother's family, among whom he could point 
<A NAME="793"></A>to his grandfather Marcus Antonius and to his great-uncle Augustus. Drusus, 
<A NAME="794"></A>on the other hand, had for his great-grandfather a Roman knight, Pomponius 
<A NAME="795"></A>Atticus, who seemed to disgrace the ancestral images of the Claudii. Again, 
<A NAME="796"></A>the consort of Germanicus, Agrippina, in number of children and in character, 
<A NAME="797"></A>was superior to Livia, the wife of Drusus. Yet the brothers were singularly 
<A NAME="798"></A>united, and were wholly unaffected by the rivalries of their 
<A NAME="799"></A>kinsfolk.
<A NAME="800"></A><BR><BR>Soon afterwards Drusus was sent into Illyricum to be familiarised 
<A NAME="801"></A>with military service, and to win the goodwill of the army. Tiberius also 
<A NAME="802"></A>thought that it was better for the young prince, who was being demoralised 
<A NAME="803"></A>by the luxury of the capital, to serve in a camp, while he felt himself 
<A NAME="804"></A>the safer with both his sons in command of legions. However, he made a 
<A NAME="805"></A>pretext of the Suevi, who were imploring help against the Cherusci. For 
<A NAME="806"></A>when the Romans had departed and they were free from the fear of an invader, 
<A NAME="807"></A>these tribes, according to the custom of the race, and then specially as 
<A NAME="808"></A>rivals in fame, had turned their arms against each other. The strength 
<A NAME="809"></A>of the two nations, the valour of their chiefs were equal. But the title 
<A NAME="810"></A>of king rendered Maroboduus hated among his countrymen, while Arminius 
<A NAME="811"></A>was regarded with favour as the champion of freedom.
<A NAME="812"></A><BR><BR>Thus it was not only the Cherusci and their allies, the old soldiers 
<A NAME="813"></A>of Arminius, who took up arms, but even the Semnones and Langobardi from 
<A NAME="814"></A>the kingdom of Maroboduus revolted to that chief. With this addition he 
<A NAME="815"></A>must have had an overwhelming superiority, had not Inguiomerus deserted 
<A NAME="816"></A>with a troop of his dependants to Maroboduus, simply for the reason that 
<A NAME="817"></A>the aged uncle scorned to obey a brother's youthful son. The armies were 
<A NAME="818"></A>drawn up, with equal confidence on both sides, and there were not those 
<A NAME="819"></A>desultory attacks or irregular bands, formerly so common with the Germans. 
<A NAME="820"></A>Prolonged warfare against us had accustomed them to keep close to their 
<A NAME="821"></A>standards, to have the support of reserves, and to take the word of command 
<A NAME="822"></A>from their generals. On this occasion Arminius, who reviewed the whole 
<A NAME="823"></A>field on horseback, as he rode up to each band, boasted of regained freedom, 
<A NAME="824"></A>of slaughtered legions, of spoils and weapons wrested from the Romans, 
<A NAME="825"></A>and still in the hands of many of his men. As for Maroboduus, he called 
<A NAME="826"></A>him a fugitive, who had no experience of battles, who had sheltered himself 
<A NAME="827"></A>in the recesses of the Hercynian forest and then with presents and embassies 
<A NAME="828"></A>sued for a treaty; a traitor to his country, a satellite of Caesar, who 
<A NAME="829"></A>deserved to be driven out, with rage as furious as that with which they 
<A NAME="830"></A>had slain Quintilius Varus. They should simply remember their many battles, 
<A NAME="831"></A>the result of which, with the final expulsion of the Romans, sufficiently 
<A NAME="832"></A>showed who could claim the crowning success in war.
<A NAME="833"></A><BR><BR>Nor did Maroboduus abstain from vaunts about himself or from revilings 
<A NAME="834"></A>of the foe. Clasping the hand of Inguiomerus, he protested "that in the 
<A NAME="835"></A>person before them centred all the renown of the Cherusci, that to his 
<A NAME="836"></A>counsels was due whatever had ended successfully. Arminius in his infatuation 
<A NAME="837"></A>and ignorance was taking to himself the glory which belonged to another, 
<A NAME="838"></A>for he had treacherously surprised three unofficered legions and a general 
<A NAME="839"></A>who had not an idea of perfidy, to the great hurt of Germany and to his 
<A NAME="840"></A>own disgrace, since his wife and his son were still enduring slavery. As 
<A NAME="841"></A>for himself, he had been attacked by twelve legions led by Tiberius, and 
<A NAME="842"></A>had preserved untarnished the glory of the Germans, and then on equal terms 
<A NAME="843"></A>the armies had parted. He was by no means sorry that they had the matter 
<A NAME="844"></A>in their own hands, whether they preferred to war with all their might 
<A NAME="845"></A>against Rome, or to accept a bloodless peace."
<A NAME="846"></A><BR><BR>To these words, which roused the two armies, was added the stimulus 
<A NAME="847"></A>of special motives of their own. The Cherusci and Langobardi were fighting 
<A NAME="848"></A>for ancient renown or newly-won freedom; the other side for the increase 
<A NAME="849"></A>of their dominion. Never at any time was the shock of battle more tremendous 
<A NAME="850"></A>or the issue more doubtful, as the right wings of both armies were routed. 
<A NAME="851"></A>Further fighting was expected, when Maroboduus withdrew his camp to the 
<A NAME="852"></A>hills. This was a sign of discomfiture. He was gradually stripped of his 
<A NAME="853"></A>strength by desertions, and, having fled to the Marcomanni, he sent envoys 
<A NAME="854"></A>to Tiberius with entreaties for help. The answer was that he had no right 
<A NAME="855"></A>to invoke the aid of Roman arms against the Cherusci, when he had rendered 
<A NAME="856"></A>no assistance to the Romans in their conflict with the same enemy. Drusus, 
<A NAME="857"></A>however, was sent as I have related, to establish peace.
<A NAME="858"></A><BR><BR>That same year twelve famous cities of Asia fell by an earthquake 
<A NAME="859"></A>in the night, so that the destruction was all the more unforeseen and fearful. 
<A NAME="860"></A>Nor were there the means of escape usual in, such a disaster, by rushing 
<A NAME="861"></A>out into the open country, for there people were swallowed up by the yawning 
<A NAME="862"></A>earth. Vast mountains, it is said, collapsed; what had been level ground 
<A NAME="863"></A>seemed to be raised aloft, and fires blazed out amid the ruin. The calamity 
<A NAME="864"></A>fell most fatally on the inhabitants of Sardis, and it attracted to them 
<A NAME="865"></A>the largest share of sympathy. The emperor promised ten million sesterces, 
<A NAME="866"></A>and remitted for five years all they paid to the exchequer or to the emperor's 
<A NAME="867"></A>purse. Magnesia, under Mount Sipylus, was considered to come next in loss 
<A NAME="868"></A>and in need of help. The people of Temnus, Philadelpheia, Aegae, Apollonis, 
<A NAME="869"></A>the Mostenians, and Hyrcanian Macedonians, as they were called, with the 
<A NAME="870"></A>towns of Hierocaesarea, Myrina, Cyme, and Tmolus, were; it was decided, 
<A NAME="871"></A>to be exempted from tribute for the same time, and some one was to be sent 
<A NAME="872"></A>from the Senate to examine their actual condition and to relieve them. 
<A NAME="873"></A>Marcus Aletus, one of the expraetors, was chosen, from a fear that, as 
<A NAME="874"></A>an exconsul was governor of Asia, there might be rivalry between men of 
<A NAME="875"></A>equal rank, and consequent embarrassment.
<A NAME="876"></A><BR><BR>To his splendid public liberality the emperor added bounties no 
<A NAME="877"></A>less popular. The property of Aemilia Musa, a rich woman who died intestate, 
<A NAME="878"></A>on which the imperial treasury had a claim, he handed over to Aemilius 
<A NAME="879"></A>Lepidus, to whose family she appeared to belong; and the estate of Patuleius, 
<A NAME="880"></A>a wealthy Roman knight, though he was himself left in part his heir, he 
<A NAME="881"></A>gave to Marcus Servilius, whose name he discovered in an earlier and unquestioned 
<A NAME="882"></A>will. In both these cases he said that noble rank ought to have the support 
<A NAME="883"></A>of wealth. Nor did he accept a legacy from any one unless he had earned 
<A NAME="884"></A>it by friendship. Those who were strangers to him, and who, because they 
<A NAME="885"></A>were at enmity with others, made the emperor their heir, he kept at a distance. 
<A NAME="886"></A>While, however, he relieved the honourable poverty of the virtuous, he 
<A NAME="887"></A>expelled from the Senate or suffered voluntarily to retire spendthrifts 
<A NAME="888"></A>whose vices had brought them to penury, like Vibidius Varro, Marius Nepos, 
<A NAME="889"></A>Appius Appianus, Cornelius Sulla, and Quintus Vitellius.
<A NAME="890"></A><BR><BR>About the same time he dedicated some temples of the gods, which 
<A NAME="891"></A>had perished from age or from fire, and which Augustus had begun to restore. 
<A NAME="892"></A>These were temples to Liber, Libera, and Ceres, near the Great Circus, 
<A NAME="893"></A>which last Aulus Postumius, when Dictator, had vowed; a temple to Flora 
<A NAME="894"></A>in the same place, which had been built by Lucius and Marcus Publicius, 
<A NAME="895"></A>aediles, and a temple to Janus, which had been erected in the vegetable 
<A NAME="896"></A>market by Caius Duilius, who was the first to make the Roman power successful 
<A NAME="897"></A>at sea and to win a naval triumph over the Carthaginians. A temple to Hope 
<A NAME="898"></A>was consecrated by Germanicus; this had been vowed by Atilius in that same 
<A NAME="899"></A>war.
<A NAME="900"></A><BR><BR>Meantime the law of treason was gaining strength. Appuleia Varilia, 
<A NAME="901"></A>grand-niece of Augustus, was accused of treason by an informer for having 
<A NAME="902"></A>ridiculed the Divine Augustus, Tiberius, and Tiberius's mother, in some 
<A NAME="903"></A>insulting remarks, and for having been convicted of adultery, allied though 
<A NAME="904"></A>she was to Caesar's house. Adultery, it was thought, was sufficiently guarded 
<A NAME="905"></A>against by the Julian law. As to the charge of treason, the emperor insisted 
<A NAME="906"></A>that it should be taken separately, and that she should be condemned if 
<A NAME="907"></A>she had spoken irreverently of Augustus. Her insinuations against himself 
<A NAME="908"></A>he did not wish to be the subject of judicial inquiry. When asked by the 
<A NAME="909"></A>consul what he thought of the unfavourable speeches she was accused of 
<A NAME="910"></A>having uttered against his mother, he said nothing. Afterwards, on the 
<A NAME="911"></A>next day of the Senate's meeting, he even begged in his mother's name that 
<A NAME="912"></A>no words of any kind spoken against her might in any case be treated as 
<A NAME="913"></A>criminal. He then acquitted Appuleia of treason. For her adultery, he deprecated 
<A NAME="914"></A>the severer penalty, and advised that she should be removed by her kinsfolk, 
<A NAME="915"></A>after the example of our forefathers, to more than two hundred miles from 
<A NAME="916"></A>Rome. Her paramour, Manlius, was forbidden to live in Italy or 
<A NAME="917"></A>Africa.
<A NAME="918"></A><BR><BR>A contest then arose about the election of a praetor in the room 
<A NAME="919"></A>of Vipstanus Gallus, whom death had removed. Germanicus and Drusus (for 
<A NAME="920"></A>they were still at Rome) supported Haterius Agrippa, a relative of Germanicus. 
<A NAME="921"></A>Many, on the other hand, endeavoured to make the number of children weigh 
<A NAME="922"></A>most in favour of the candidates. Tiberius rejoiced to see a strife in 
<A NAME="923"></A>the Senate between his sons and the law. Beyond question the law was beaten, 
<A NAME="924"></A>but not at once, and only by a few votes, in the same way as laws were 
<A NAME="925"></A>defeated even when they were in force.
<A NAME="926"></A><BR><BR>In this same year a war broke out in Africa, where the enemy was 
<A NAME="927"></A>led by Tacfarinas. A Numidian by birth, he had served as an auxiliary in 
<A NAME="928"></A>the Roman camp, then becoming a deserter, he at first gathered round him 
<A NAME="929"></A>a roving band familiar with robbery, for plunder and for rapine. After 
<A NAME="930"></A>a while, he marshalled them like regular soldiers, under standards and 
<A NAME="931"></A>in troops, till at last he was regarded as the leader, not of an undisciplined 
<A NAME="932"></A>rabble, but of the Musulamian people. This powerful tribe, bordering on 
<A NAME="933"></A>the deserts of Africa, and even then with none of the civilisation of cities, 
<A NAME="934"></A>took up arms and drew their Moorish neighbours into the war. These too 
<A NAME="935"></A>had a leader, Mazippa. The army was so divided that Tacfarinas kept the 
<A NAME="936"></A>picked men who were armed in Roman fashion within a camp, and familiarised 
<A NAME="937"></A>them with a commander's authority, while Mazippa, with light troops, spread 
<A NAME="938"></A>around him fire, slaughter, and consternation. They had forced the Ciniphii, 
<A NAME="939"></A>a far from contemptible tribe, into their cause, when Furius Camillus, 
<A NAME="940"></A>proconsul of Africa, united in one force a legion and all the regularly 
<A NAME="941"></A>enlisted allies, and, with an army insignificant indeed compared with the 
<A NAME="942"></A>multitude of the Numidians and Moors, marched against the enemy. There 
<A NAME="943"></A>was nothing however which he strove so much to avoid as their eluding an 
<A NAME="944"></A>engagement out of fear. It was by the hope of victory that they were lured 
<A NAME="945"></A>on only to be defeated. The legion was in the army's centre; the light 
<A NAME="946"></A>cohorts and two cavalry squadrons on its wings. Nor did Tacfarinas refuse 
<A NAME="947"></A>battle. The Numidians were routed, and after a number of years the name 
<A NAME="948"></A>of Furius won military renown. Since the days of the famous deliverer of 
<A NAME="949"></A>our city and his son Camillus, fame as a general had fallen to the lot 
<A NAME="950"></A>of other branches of the family, and the man of whom I am now speaking 
<A NAME="951"></A>was regarded as an inexperienced soldier. All the more willingly did Tiberius 
<A NAME="952"></A>commemorate his achievements in the Senate, and the Senators voted him 
<A NAME="953"></A>the ornaments of triumph, an honour which Camillus, because of his unambitious 
<A NAME="954"></A>life, enjoyed without harm.
<A NAME="955"></A><BR><BR>In the following year Tiberius held his third, Germanicus his second, 
<A NAME="956"></A>consulship. Germanicus, however, entered on the office at Nicopolis, a 
<A NAME="957"></A>city of Achaia, whither he had arrived by the coast of Illyricum, after 
<A NAME="958"></A>having seen his brother Drusus, who was then in Dalmatia, and endured a 
<A NAME="959"></A>stormy voyage through the Adriatic and afterwards the Ionian Sea. He accordingly 
<A NAME="960"></A>devoted a few days to the repair of his fleet, and, at the same time, in 
<A NAME="961"></A>remembrance of his ancestors, he visited the bay which the victory of Actium 
<A NAME="962"></A>had made famous, the spoils consecrated by Augustus, and the camp of Antonius. 
<A NAME="963"></A>For, as I have said, Augustus was his great-uncle, Antonius his grandfather, 
<A NAME="964"></A>and vivid images of disaster and success rose before him on the spot. Thence 
<A NAME="965"></A>he went to Athens, and there, as a concession to our treaty with an allied 
<A NAME="966"></A>and ancient city, he was attended only by a single lictor. The Greeks welcomed 
<A NAME="967"></A>him with the most elaborate honours, and brought forward all the old deeds 
<A NAME="968"></A>and sayings of their countrymen, to give additional dignity to their 
<A NAME="969"></A>flattery.
<A NAME="970"></A><BR><BR>Thence he directed his course to Euboea and crossed to Lesbos, 
<A NAME="971"></A>where Agrippina for the last time was confined and gave birth to Julia. 
<A NAME="972"></A>He then penetrated to the remoter parts of the province of Asia, visited 
<A NAME="973"></A>the Thracian cities, Perinthus and Byzantium; next, the narrow strait of 
<A NAME="974"></A>the Propontis and the entrance of the Pontus, from an anxious wish to become 
<A NAME="975"></A>acquainted with those ancient and celebrated localities. He gave relief, 
<A NAME="976"></A>as he went, to provinces which had been exhausted by internal feuds or 
<A NAME="977"></A>by the oppressions of governors. In his return he attempted to see the 
<A NAME="978"></A>sacred mysteries of the Samothracians, but north winds which he encountered 
<A NAME="979"></A>drove him aside from his course. And so after visiting Ilium and surveying 
<A NAME="980"></A>a scene venerable from the vicissitudes of fortune and as the birth-place 
<A NAME="981"></A>of our people, he coasted back along Asia, and touched at Colophon, to 
<A NAME="982"></A>consult the oracle of the Clarian Apollo. There, it is not a woman, as 
<A NAME="983"></A>at Delphi, but a priest chosen from certain families, generally from Miletus, 
<A NAME="984"></A>who ascertains simply the number and the names of the applicants. Then 
<A NAME="985"></A>descending into a cave and drinking a draught from a secret spring, the 
<A NAME="986"></A>man, who is commonly ignorant of letters and of poetry, utters a response 
<A NAME="987"></A>in verse answering to the thoughts conceived in the mind of any inquirer. 
<A NAME="988"></A>It was said that he prophesied to Germanicus, in dark hints, as oracles 
<A NAME="989"></A>usually do, an early doom.
<A NAME="990"></A><BR><BR>Cneius Piso meanwhile, that he might the sooner enter on his design, 
<A NAME="991"></A>terrified the citizens of Athens by his tumultuous approach, and then reviled 
<A NAME="992"></A>them in a bitter speech, with indirect reflections on Germanicus, who, 
<A NAME="993"></A>he said, had derogated from the honour of the Roman name in having treated 
<A NAME="994"></A>with excessive courtesy, not the people of Athens, who indeed had been 
<A NAME="995"></A>exterminated by repeated disasters, but a miserable medley of tribes. As 
<A NAME="996"></A>for the men before him, they had been Mithridates's allies against Sulla, 
<A NAME="997"></A>allies of Antonius against the Divine Augustus. He taunted them too with 
<A NAME="998"></A>the past, with their ill-success against the Macedonians, their violence 
<A NAME="999"></A>to their own countrymen, for he had his own special grudge against this 
<A NAME="1000"></A>city, because they would not spare at his intercession one Theophilus whom 
<A NAME="1001"></A>the Areopagus had condemned for forgery. Then, by sailing rapidly and by 
<A NAME="1002"></A>the shortest route through the Cyclades, he overtook Germanicus at the 
<A NAME="1003"></A>island of Rhodes. The prince was not ignorant of the slanders with which 
<A NAME="1004"></A>he had been assailed, but his good nature was such that when a storm arose 
<A NAME="1005"></A>and drove Piso on rocks, and his enemy's destruction could have been referred 
<A NAME="1006"></A>to chance, he sent some triremes, by the help of which he might be rescued 
<A NAME="1007"></A>from danger. But this did not soften Piso's heart. Scarcely allowing a 
<A NAME="1008"></A>day's interval, he left Germanicus and hastened on in advance. When he 
<A NAME="1009"></A>reached Syria and the legions, he began, by bribery and favouritism, to 
<A NAME="1010"></A>encourage the lowest of the common soldiers, removing the old centurions 
<A NAME="1011"></A>and the strict tribunes and assigning their places to creatures of his 
<A NAME="1012"></A>own or to the vilest of the men, while he allowed idleness in the camp, 
<A NAME="1013"></A>licentiousness in the towns, and the soldiers to roam through the country 
<A NAME="1014"></A>and take their pleasure. He went such lengths in demoralizing them, that 
<A NAME="1015"></A>he was spoken of in their vulgar talk as the father of the 
<A NAME="1016"></A>legions.
<A NAME="1017"></A><BR><BR>Plancina too, instead of keeping herself within the proper limits 
<A NAME="1018"></A>of a woman, would be present at the evolutions of the cavalry and the manoeuvres 
<A NAME="1019"></A>of the cohorts, and would fling insulting remarks at Agrippina and Germanicus. 
<A NAME="1020"></A>Some even of the good soldiers were inclined to a corrupt compliance, as 
<A NAME="1021"></A>a whispered rumour gained ground that the emperor was not averse to these 
<A NAME="1022"></A>proceedings. Of all this Germanicus was aware, but his most pressing anxiety 
<A NAME="1023"></A>was to be first in reaching Armenia.
<A NAME="1024"></A><BR><BR>This had been of old an unsettled country from the character of 
<A NAME="1025"></A>its people and from its geographical position, bordering, as it does, to 
<A NAME="1026"></A>a great extent on our provinces and stretching far away to Media. It lies 
<A NAME="1027"></A>between two most mighty empires, and is very often at strife with them, 
<A NAME="1028"></A>hating Rome and jealous of Parthia. It had at this time no king, Vonones 
<A NAME="1029"></A>having been expelled, but the nation's likings inclined towards Zeno, son 
<A NAME="1030"></A>of Polemon, king of Pontus, who from his earliest infancy had imitated 
<A NAME="1031"></A>Armenian manners and customs, loving the chase, the banquet, and all the 
<A NAME="1032"></A>popular pastimes of barbarians, and who had thus bound to himself chiefs 
<A NAME="1033"></A>and people alike. Germanicus accordingly, in the city of Artaxata, with 
<A NAME="1034"></A>the approval of the nobility, in the presence of a vast multitude, placed 
<A NAME="1035"></A>the royal diadem on his head. All paid him homage and saluted him as King 
<A NAME="1036"></A>Artaxias, which name they gave him from the city.
<A NAME="1037"></A><BR><BR>Cappadocia meanwhile, which had been reduced to the form of a province, 
<A NAME="1038"></A>received as its governor Quintus Veranius. Some of the royal tributes were 
<A NAME="1039"></A>diminished, to inspire hope of a gentler rule under Rome. Quintus Servaeus 
<A NAME="1040"></A>was appointed to Commagene, then first put under a praetor's 
<A NAME="1041"></A>jurisdiction.
<A NAME="1042"></A><BR><BR>Successful as was this settlement of all the interests of our allies, 
<A NAME="1043"></A>it gave Germanicus little joy because of the arrogance of Piso. Though 
<A NAME="1044"></A>he had been ordered to march part of the legions into Armenia under his 
<A NAME="1045"></A>own or his son's command, he had neglected to do either. At length the 
<A NAME="1046"></A>two met at Cyrrhus, the winterquarters of the tenth legion, each controlling 
<A NAME="1047"></A>his looks, Piso concealing his fears, Germanicus shunning the semblance 
<A NAME="1048"></A>of menace. He was indeed, as I have said, a kind-hearted man. But friends 
<A NAME="1049"></A>who knew well how to inflame a quarrel, exaggerated what was true and added 
<A NAME="1050"></A>lies, alleging various charges against Piso, Plancina, and their 
<A NAME="1051"></A>sons.
<A NAME="1052"></A><BR><BR>At last, in the presence of a few intimate associates, Germanicus 
<A NAME="1053"></A>addressed him in language such as suppressed resentment suggests, to which 
<A NAME="1054"></A>Piso replied with haughty apologies. They parted in open enmity. After 
<A NAME="1055"></A>this Piso was seldom seen at Caesar's tribunal, and if he ever sat by him, 
<A NAME="1056"></A>it was with a sullen frown and a marked display of opposition. He was even 
<A NAME="1057"></A>heard to say at a banquet given by the king of the Nabataeans, when some 
<A NAME="1058"></A>golden crowns of great weight were presented to Caesar and Agrippina and 
<A NAME="1059"></A>light ones to Piso and the rest, that the entertainment was given to the 
<A NAME="1060"></A>son of a Roman emperor, not of a Parthian king. At the same time he threw 
<A NAME="1061"></A>his crown on the ground, with a long speech against luxury, which, though 
<A NAME="1062"></A>it angered Germanicus, he still bore with patience.
<A NAME="1063"></A><BR><BR>Meantime envoys arrived from Artabanus, king of the Parthians. 
<A NAME="1064"></A>He had sent them to recall the memory of friendship and alliance, with 
<A NAME="1065"></A>an assurance that he wished for a renewal of the emblems of concord, and 
<A NAME="1066"></A>that he would in honour of Germanicus yield the point of advancing to the 
<A NAME="1067"></A>bank of the Euphrates. He begged meanwhile that Vonones might not be kept 
<A NAME="1068"></A>in Syria, where, by emissaries from an easy distance, he might draw the 
<A NAME="1069"></A>chiefs of the tribes into civil strife. Germanicus' answer as to the alliance 
<A NAME="1070"></A>between Rome and Parthia was dignified; as to the king's visit and the 
<A NAME="1071"></A>respect shown to himself, it was graceful and modest. Vonones was removed 
<A NAME="1072"></A>to Pompeiopolis, a city on the coast of Cilicia. This was not merely a 
<A NAME="1073"></A>concession to the request of Artabanus, but was meant as an affront to 
<A NAME="1074"></A>Piso, who had a special liking for Vonones, because of the many attentions 
<A NAME="1075"></A>and presents by which he had won Plancina's favour.
<A NAME="1076"></A><BR><BR>In the consulship of Marcus Silanus and Lucius Norbanus, Germanicus 
<A NAME="1077"></A>set out for Egypt to study its antiquities. His ostensible motive however 
<A NAME="1078"></A>was solicitude for the province. He reduced the price of corn by opening 
<A NAME="1079"></A>the granaries, and adopted many practices pleasing to the multitude. He 
<A NAME="1080"></A>would go about without soldiers, with sandalled feet, and apparelled after 
<A NAME="1081"></A>the Greek fashion, in imitation of Publius Scipio, who, it is said, habitually 
<A NAME="1082"></A>did the same in Sicily, even when the war with Carthage was still raging. 
<A NAME="1083"></A>Tiberius having gently expressed disapproval of his dress and manners, 
<A NAME="1084"></A>pronounced a very sharp censure on his visit to Alexandria without the 
<A NAME="1085"></A>emperor's leave, contrary to the regulations of Augustus. That prince, 
<A NAME="1086"></A>among other secrets of imperial
