<A NAME="start"></A>
<A NAME="10"></A>A.D. 70
<A NAME="11"></A><BR><BR>Early in this year Titus Caesar, who had been selected by his father 
<A NAME="12"></A>to complete the subjugation of Judaea, and who had gained distinction as 
<A NAME="13"></A>a soldier while both were still subjects, began to rise in power and reputation, 
<A NAME="14"></A>as armies and provinces emulated each other in their attachment to him. 
<A NAME="15"></A>The young man himself, anxious to be thought superior to his station, was 
<A NAME="16"></A>ever displaying his gracefulness and his energy in war. By his courtesy 
<A NAME="17"></A>and affability he called forth a willing obedience, and he often mixed 
<A NAME="18"></A>with the common soldiers, while working or marching, without impairing 
<A NAME="19"></A>his dignity as general. He found in Judaea three legions, the 5th, the 
<A NAME="20"></A>10th, and the 15th, all old troops of Vespasian's. To these he added the 
<A NAME="21"></A>12th from Syria, and some men belonging to the 18th and 3rd, whom he had 
<A NAME="22"></A>withdrawn from Alexandria. This force was accompanied by twenty cohorts 
<A NAME="23"></A>of allied troops and eight squadrons of cavalry, by the two kings Agrippa 
<A NAME="24"></A>and Sohemus, by the auxiliary forces of king Antiochus, by a strong contingent 
<A NAME="25"></A>of Arabs, who hated the Jews with the usual hatred of neighbours, and, 
<A NAME="26"></A>lastly, by many persons brought from the capital and from Italy by private 
<A NAME="27"></A>hopes of securing the yet unengaged affections of the Prince. With this 
<A NAME="28"></A>force Titus entered the enemy's territory, preserving strict order on his 
<A NAME="29"></A>march, reconnoitring every spot, and always ready to give battle. At last 
<A NAME="30"></A>he encamped near Jerusalem.
<A NAME="31"></A><BR><BR>As I am about to relate the last days of a famous city, it seems 
<A NAME="32"></A>appropriate to throw some light on its origin.
<A NAME="33"></A><BR><BR>Some say that the Jews were fugitives from the island of Crete, 
<A NAME="34"></A>who settled on the nearest coast of Africa about the time when Saturn was 
<A NAME="35"></A>driven from his throne by the power of Jupiter. Evidence of this is sought 
<A NAME="36"></A>in the name. There is a famous mountain in Crete called Ida; the neighbouring 
<A NAME="37"></A>tribe, the Idaei, came to be called Judaei by a barbarous lengthening of 
<A NAME="38"></A>the national name. Others assert that in the reign of Isis the overflowing 
<A NAME="39"></A>population of Egypt, led by Hierosolymus and Judas, discharged itself into 
<A NAME="40"></A>the neighbouring countries. Many, again, say that they were a race of Ethiopian 
<A NAME="41"></A>origin, who in the time of king Cepheus were driven by fear and hatred 
<A NAME="42"></A>of their neighbours to seek a new dwelling-place. Others describe them 
<A NAME="43"></A>as an Assyrian horde who, not having sufficient territory, took possession 
<A NAME="44"></A>of part of Egypt, and founded cities of their own in what is called the 
<A NAME="45"></A>Hebrew country, lying on the borders of Syria. Others, again, assign a 
<A NAME="46"></A>very distinguished origin to the Jews, alleging that they were the Solymi, 
<A NAME="47"></A>a nation celebrated in the poems of Homer, who called the city which they 
<A NAME="48"></A>founded Hierosolyma after their own name.
<A NAME="49"></A><BR><BR>Most writers, however, agree in stating that once a disease, which 
<A NAME="50"></A>horribly disfigured the body, broke out over Egypt; that king Bocchoris, 
<A NAME="51"></A>seeking a remedy, consulted the oracle of Hammon, and was bidden to cleanse 
<A NAME="52"></A>his realm, and to convey into some foreign land this race detested by the 
<A NAME="53"></A>gods. The people, who had been collected after diligent search, finding 
<A NAME="54"></A>themselves left in a desert, sat for the most part in a stupor of grief, 
<A NAME="55"></A>till one of the exiles, Moyses by name, warned them not to look for any 
<A NAME="56"></A>relief from God or man, forsaken as they were of both, but to trust to 
<A NAME="57"></A>themselves, taking for their heaven-sent leader that man who should first 
<A NAME="58"></A>help them to be quit of their present misery. They agreed, and in utter 
<A NAME="59"></A>ignorance began to advance at random. Nothing, however, distressed them 
<A NAME="60"></A>so much as the scarcity of water, and they had sunk ready to perish in 
<A NAME="61"></A>all directions over the plain, when a herd of wild asses was seen to retire 
<A NAME="62"></A>from their pasture to a rock shaded by trees. Moyses followed them, and, 
<A NAME="63"></A>guided by the appearance of a grassy spot, discovered an abundant spring 
<A NAME="64"></A>of water. This furnished relief. After a continuous journey for six days, 
<A NAME="65"></A>on the seventh they possessed themselves of a country, from which they 
<A NAME="66"></A>expelled the inhabitants, and in which they founded a city and a 
<A NAME="67"></A>temple.
<A NAME="68"></A><BR><BR>Moyses, wishing to secure for the future his authority over the 
<A NAME="69"></A>nation, gave them a novel form of worship, opposed to all that is practised 
<A NAME="70"></A>by other men. Things sacred with us, with them have no sanctity, while 
<A NAME="71"></A>they allow what with us is forbidden. In their holy place they have consecrated 
<A NAME="72"></A>an image of the animal by whose guidance they found deliverance from their 
<A NAME="73"></A>long and thirsty wanderings. They slay the ram, seemingly in derision of 
<A NAME="74"></A>Hammon, and they sacrifice the ox, because the Egyptians worship it as 
<A NAME="75"></A>Apis. They abstain from swine's flesh, in consideration of what they suffered 
<A NAME="76"></A>when they were infected by the leprosy to which this animal is liable. 
<A NAME="77"></A>By their frequent fasts they still bear witness to the long hunger of former 
<A NAME="78"></A>days, and the Jewish bread, made without leaven, is retained as a memorial 
<A NAME="79"></A>of their hurried seizure of corn. We are told that the rest of the seventh 
<A NAME="80"></A>day was adopted, because this day brought with it a termination of their 
<A NAME="81"></A>toils; after a while the charm of indolence beguilded them into giving 
<A NAME="82"></A>up the seventh year also to inaction. But others say that it is an observance 
<A NAME="83"></A>in honour of Saturn, either from the primitive elements of their faith 
<A NAME="84"></A>having been transmitted from the Idaei, who are said to have shared the 
<A NAME="85"></A>flight of that God, and to have founded the race, or from the circumstance 
<A NAME="86"></A>that of the seven stars which rule the destinies of men Saturn moves in 
<A NAME="87"></A>the highest orbit and with the mightiest power, and that many of the heavenly 
<A NAME="88"></A>bodies complete their revolutions and courses in multiples of 
<A NAME="89"></A>seven.
<A NAME="90"></A><BR><BR>This worship, however introduced, is upheld by its antiquity; all 
<A NAME="91"></A>their other customs, which are at once perverse and disgusting, owe their 
<A NAME="92"></A>strength to their very badness. The most degraded out of other races, scorning 
<A NAME="93"></A>their national beliefs, brought to them their contributions and presents. 
<A NAME="94"></A>This augmented the wealth of the Jews, as also did the fact, that among 
<A NAME="95"></A>themselves they are inflexibly honest and ever ready to shew compassion, 
<A NAME="96"></A>though they regard the rest of mankind with all the hatred of enemies. 
<A NAME="97"></A>They sit apart at meals, they sleep apart, and though, as a nation, they 
<A NAME="98"></A>are singularly prone to lust, they abstain from intercourse with foreign 
<A NAME="99"></A>women; among themselves nothing is unlawful. Circumcision was adopted by 
<A NAME="100"></A>them as a mark of difference from other men. Those who come over to their 
<A NAME="101"></A>religion adopt the practice, and have this lesson first instilled into 
<A NAME="102"></A>them, to despise all gods, to disown their country, and set at nought parents, 
<A NAME="103"></A>children, and brethren. Still they provide for the increase of their numbers. 
<A NAME="104"></A>It is a crime among them to kill any newly-born infant. They hold that 
<A NAME="105"></A>the souls of all who perish in battle or by the hands of the executioner 
<A NAME="106"></A>are immortal. Hence a passion for propagating their race and a contempt 
<A NAME="107"></A>for death. They are wont to bury rather than to burn their dead, following 
<A NAME="108"></A>in this the Egyptian cus tom; they bestow the same care on the dead, and 
<A NAME="109"></A>they hold the same belief about the lower world. Quite different is their 
<A NAME="110"></A>faith about things divine. The Egyptians worship many animals and images 
<A NAME="111"></A>of monstrous form; the Jews have purely mental conceptions of Deity, as 
<A NAME="112"></A>one in essence. They call those profane who make representations of God 
<A NAME="113"></A>in human shape out of perishable materials. They believe that Being to 
<A NAME="114"></A>be supreme and eternal, neither capable of representation, nor of decay. 
<A NAME="115"></A>They therefore do not allow any images to stand in their cities, much less 
<A NAME="116"></A>in their temples. This flattery is not paid to their kings, nor this honour 
<A NAME="117"></A>to our Emperors. From the fact, however, that their priests used to chant 
<A NAME="118"></A>to the music of flutes and cymbals, and to wear garlands of ivy, and that 
<A NAME="119"></A>a golden vine was found in the temple, some have thought that they worshipped 
<A NAME="120"></A>father Liber, the conqueror of the East, though their institutions do not 
<A NAME="121"></A>by any means harmonize with the theory; for Liber established a festive 
<A NAME="122"></A>and cheerful worship, while the Jewish religion is tasteless and 
<A NAME="123"></A>mean.
<A NAME="124"></A><BR><BR>Eastward the country is bounded by Arabia; to the south lies Egypt; 
<A NAME="125"></A>on the west are Phoenicia and the Mediterranean. Northward it commands 
<A NAME="126"></A>an extensive prospect over Syria. The inhabitants are healthy and able 
<A NAME="127"></A>to bear fatigue. Rain is uncommon, but the soil is fertile. Its products 
<A NAME="128"></A>resemble our own. They have, besides, the balsam-tree and the palm. The 
<A NAME="129"></A>palm-groves are tall and graceful. The balsam is a shrub; each branch, 
<A NAME="130"></A>as it fills with sap, may be pierced with a fragment of stone or pottery. 
<A NAME="131"></A>If steel is employed, the veins shrink up. The sap is used by physicians. 
<A NAME="132"></A>Libanus is the principal mountain, and has, strange to say, amidst these 
<A NAME="133"></A>burning heats, a summit shaded with trees and never deserted by its snows. 
<A NAME="134"></A>The same range supplies and sends forth the stream of the Jordan. This 
<A NAME="135"></A>river does not discharge itself into the sea, but flows entire through 
<A NAME="136"></A>two lakes, and is lost in the third. This is a lake of vast circumference; 
<A NAME="137"></A>it resembles the sea, but is more nauseous in taste; it breeds pestilence 
<A NAME="138"></A>among those who live near by its noisome odour; it cannot be moved by the 
<A NAME="139"></A>wind, and it affords no home either to fish or water-birds. These strange 
<A NAME="140"></A>waters support what is thrown upon them, as on a solid surface, and all 
<A NAME="141"></A>persons, whether they can swim or no, are equally buoyed up by the waves. 
<A NAME="142"></A>At a certain season of the year the lake throws up bitumen, and the method 
<A NAME="143"></A>of collecting it has been taught by that experience which teaches all other 
<A NAME="144"></A>arts. It is naturally a fluid of dark colour; when vinegar is sprinkled 
<A NAME="145"></A>upon it, it coagulates and floats upon the surface. Those whose business 
<A NAME="146"></A>it is take it with the hand, and draw it on to the deck of the boat; it 
<A NAME="147"></A>then continues of itself to flow in and lade the vessel till the stream 
<A NAME="148"></A>is cut off. Nor can this be done by any instrument of brass or iron. It 
<A NAME="149"></A>shrinks from blood or any cloth stained by the menstrua of women. Such 
<A NAME="150"></A>is the account of old authors; but those who know the country say that 
<A NAME="151"></A>the bitumen moves in heaving masses on the water, that it is drawn by hand 
<A NAME="152"></A>to the shore, and that there, when dried by the evaporation of the earth 
<A NAME="153"></A>and the power of the sun, it is cut into pieces with axes and wedges just 
<A NAME="154"></A>as timber or stone would be.
<A NAME="155"></A><BR><BR>Not far from this lake lies a plain, once fertile, they say, and 
<A NAME="156"></A>the site of great cities, but afterwards struck by lightning and consumed. 
<A NAME="157"></A>Of this event, they declare, traces still remain, for the soil, which is 
<A NAME="158"></A>scorched in appearance, has lost its productive power. Everything that 
<A NAME="159"></A>grows spontaneously, as well as what is planted by hand, either when the 
<A NAME="160"></A>leaf or flower have been developed, or after maturing in the usual form, 
<A NAME="161"></A>becomes black and rotten, and crumbles into a kind of dust. I am ready 
<A NAME="162"></A>to allow, on the one hand, that cities, once famous, may have been consumed 
<A NAME="163"></A>by fire from heaven, while, on the other, I imagine that the earth is infected 
<A NAME="164"></A>by the exhalations of the lake, that the surrounding air is tainted, and 
<A NAME="165"></A>that thus the growth of harvest and the fruits of autumn decay under the 
<A NAME="166"></A>equally noxious influences of soil and climate. The river Belus also flows 
<A NAME="167"></A>into the Jewish sea. About its mouth is a kind of sand which is collected, 
<A NAME="168"></A>mixed with nitre, and fused into glass. This shore is of limited extent, 
<A NAME="169"></A>but furnishes an inexhaustible supply to the exporter.
<A NAME="170"></A><BR><BR>A great part of Judaea consists of scattered villages. They have 
<A NAME="171"></A>also towns. Jersualem is the capital. There stood a temple of immense wealth. 
<A NAME="172"></A>First came the city with its fortifications, then the royal palace, then, 
<A NAME="173"></A>within the innermost defences, the temple itself. Only the Jew might approach 
<A NAME="174"></A>the gates; all but priests were forbidden to pass the threshold. While 
<A NAME="175"></A>the East was under the sway of the Assyrians, the Medes, and the Persians, 
<A NAME="176"></A>Jews were the most contemptible of the subject tribes. When the Macedonians 
<A NAME="177"></A>became supreme, King Antiochus strove to destroy the national superstition, 
<A NAME="178"></A>and to introduce Greek civilization, but was prevented by his war with 
<A NAME="179"></A>the Parthians from at all improving this vilest of nations; for at this 
<A NAME="180"></A>time the revolt of Arsaces had taken place. The Macedonian power was now 
<A NAME="181"></A>weak, while the Parthian had not yet reached its full strength, and, as 
<A NAME="182"></A>the Romans were still far off, the Jews chose kings for themselves. Expelled 
<A NAME="183"></A>by the fickle populace, and regaining their throne by force of arms, these 
<A NAME="184"></A>princes, while they ventured on the wholesale banishment of their subjects, 
<A NAME="185"></A>on the destruction of cities, on the murder of brothers, wives, and parents, 
<A NAME="186"></A>and the other usual atrocities of despots, fostered the national superstition 
<A NAME="187"></A>by appropriating the dignity of the priesthood as the support of their 
<A NAME="188"></A>political power.
<A NAME="189"></A><BR><BR>Cneius Pompeius was the first of our countrymen to subdue the Jews. 
<A NAME="190"></A>Availing himself of the right of conquest, he entered the temple. Thus 
<A NAME="191"></A>it became commonly known that the place stood empty with no similitude 
<A NAME="192"></A>of gods within, and that the shrine had nothing to reveal. The walls of 
<A NAME="193"></A>Jerusalem were destroyed, the temple was left standing. After these provinces 
<A NAME="194"></A>had fallen, in the course of our civil wars, into the hands of Marcus Antonius, 
<A NAME="195"></A>Pacorus, king of the Parthians, seized Judaea. He was slain by Publius 
<A NAME="196"></A>Ventidius, and the Parthians were driven back over the Euphrates. Caius 
<A NAME="197"></A>Sosius reduced the Jews to subjection. The royal power, which had been 
<A NAME="198"></A>bestowed by Antony on Herod, was augmented by the victorious Augustus. 
<A NAME="199"></A>On Herod's death, one Simon, without waiting for the approbation of the 
<A NAME="200"></A>Emperor, usurped the title of king. He was punished by Quintilius Varus 
<A NAME="201"></A>then governor of Syria, and the nation, with its liberties curtailed, was 
<A NAME="202"></A>divided into three provinces under the sons of Herod. Under Tiberius all 
<A NAME="203"></A>was quiet. But when the Jews were ordered by Caligula to set up his statue 
<A NAME="204"></A>in the temple, they preferred the alternative of war. The death of the 
<A NAME="205"></A>Emperor put an end to the disturbance. The kings were either dead, or reduced 
<A NAME="206"></A>to insignificance, when Claudius entrusted the province of Judaea to the 
<A NAME="207"></A>Roman Knights or to his own freedmen, one of whom, Antonius Felix, indulging 
<A NAME="208"></A>in every kind of barbarity and lust, exercised the power of a king in the 
<A NAME="209"></A>spirit of a slave. He had married Drusilla, the granddaughter of Antony 
<A NAME="210"></A>and Cleopatra, and so was the grandson-in-law, as Claudius was the grandson, 
<A NAME="211"></A>of Antony.
<A NAME="212"></A><BR><BR>Yet the endurance of the Jews lasted till Gessius Florus was procurator. 
<A NAME="213"></A>In his time the war broke out. Cestius Gallus, legate of Syria, who attempted 
<A NAME="214"></A>to crush it, had to fight several battles, generally with ill-success. 
<A NAME="215"></A>Cestius dying, either in the course of nature, or from vexation, Vespasian 
<A NAME="216"></A>was sent by Nero, and by help of his good fortune, his high reputation, 
<A NAME="217"></A>and his excellent subordinates, succeeded within the space of two summers 
<A NAME="218"></A>in occupying with his victorious army the whole of the level country and 
<A NAME="219"></A>all the cities, except Jerusalem. The following year had been wholly taken 
<A NAME="220"></A>up with civil strife, and had passed, as far as the Jews were concerned, 
<A NAME="221"></A>in inaction. Peace having been established in Italy, foreign affairs were 
<A NAME="222"></A>once more remembered. Our indignation was heightened by the circumstance 
<A NAME="223"></A>that the Jews alone had not submitted. At the same time it was held to 
<A NAME="224"></A>be more expedient, in reference to the possible results and contingencies 
<A NAME="225"></A>of the new reign, that Titus should remain with the 
<A NAME="226"></A>army.
<A NAME="227"></A><BR><BR>Accordingly he pitched his camp, as I have related, before the 
<A NAME="228"></A>walls of Jerusalem, and displayed his legions in order of 
<A NAME="229"></A>battle.
<A NAME="230"></A><BR><BR>The Jews formed their line close under their walls, whence, if 
<A NAME="231"></A>successful, they might venture to advance, and where, if repulsed, they 
<A NAME="232"></A>had a refuge at hand. The cavalry with some light infantry was sent to 
<A NAME="233"></A>attack them, and fought without any decisive result. Shortly afterwards 
<A NAME="234"></A>the enemy retreated. During the following days they fought a series of 
<A NAME="235"></A>engagements in front of the gates, till they were driven within the walls 
<A NAME="236"></A>by continual defeats. The Romans then began to prepare for an assault. 
<A NAME="237"></A>It seemed beneath them to await the result of famine. The army demanded 
<A NAME="238"></A>the more perilous alternative, some prompted by courage, many by sheer 
<A NAME="239"></A>ferocity and greed of gain. Titus himself had Rome with all its wealth 
<A NAME="240"></A>and pleasures before his eyes. Jerusalem must fall at once, or it would 
<A NAME="241"></A>delay his enjoyment of them. But the commanding situation of the city had 
<A NAME="242"></A>been strengthened by enormous works which would have been a thorough defence 
<A NAME="243"></A>even for level ground. Two hills of great height were fenced in by walls 
<A NAME="244"></A>which had been skilfully obliqued or bent inwards, in such a manner that 
<A NAME="245"></A>the flank of an assailant was exposed to missiles. The rock terminated 
<A NAME="246"></A>in a precipice; the towers were raised to a height of sixty feet, where 
<A NAME="247"></A>the hill lent its aid to the fortifications, where the ground fell, to 
<A NAME="248"></A>a height of one hundred and twenty. They had a marvellous appearance, and 
<A NAME="249"></A>to a distant spectator seemed to be of uniform elevation. Within were other 
<A NAME="250"></A>walls surrounding the palace, and, rising to a conspicuous height, the 
<A NAME="251"></A>tower Antonia, so called by Herod, in honour of Marcus 
<A NAME="252"></A>Antonius.
<A NAME="253"></A><BR><BR>The temple resembled a citadel, and had its own walls, which were 
<A NAME="254"></A>more laboriously constructed than the others. Even the colonnades with 
<A NAME="255"></A>which it was surrounded formed an admirable outwork. It contained an inexhaustible 
<A NAME="256"></A>spring; there were subterranean excavations in the hill, and tanks and 
<A NAME="257"></A>cisterns for holding rain water. The founders of the state had foreseen 
<A NAME="258"></A>that frequent wars would result from the singularity of its customs, and 
<A NAME="259"></A>so had made every provision against the most protracted siege. After the 
<A NAME="260"></A>capture of their city by Pompey, experience and apprehension taught them 
<A NAME="261"></A>much. Availing themselves of the sordid policy of the Claudian era to purchase 
<A NAME="262"></A>the right of fortification, they raised in time of peace such walls as 
<A NAME="263"></A>were suited for war. Their numbers were increased by a vast rabble collected 
<A NAME="264"></A>from the overthrow of the other cities. All the most obstinate rebels had 
<A NAME="265"></A>escaped into the place, and perpetual seditions were the consequence. There 
<A NAME="266"></A>were three generals, and as many armies. Simon held the outer and larger 
<A NAME="267"></A>circuit of walls. John, also called Bargioras, occupied the middle city. 
<A NAME="268"></A>Eleazar had fortified the temple. John and Simon were strong in numbers 
<A NAME="269"></A>and equipment, Eleazar in position. There were continual skirmishes, surprises, 
<A NAME="270"></A>and incendiary fires, and a vast quantity of corn was burnt. Before long 
<A NAME="271"></A>John sent some emissaries, who, under pretence of sacrificing, slaughtered 
<A NAME="272"></A>Eleazar and his partisans, and gained possession of the temple. The city 
<A NAME="273"></A>was thus divided between two factions, till, as the Romans approached, 
<A NAME="274"></A>war with the foreigner brought about a reconciliation.
<A NAME="275"></A><BR><BR>Prodigies had occurred, which this nation, prone to superstition, 
<A NAME="276"></A>but hating all religious rites, did not deem it lawful to expiate by offering 
<A NAME="277"></A>and sacrifice. There had been seen hosts joining battle in the skies, the 
<A NAME="278"></A>fiery gleam of arms, the temple illuminated by a sudden radiance from the 
<A NAME="279"></A>clouds. The doors of the inner shrine were suddenly thrown open, and a 
<A NAME="280"></A>voice of more than mortal tone was heard to cry that the Gods were departing. 
<A NAME="281"></A>At the same instant there was a mighty stir as of departure. Some few put 
<A NAME="282"></A>a fearful meaning on these events, but in most there was a firm persuasion, 
<A NAME="283"></A>that in the ancient records of their priests was contained a prediction 
<A NAME="284"></A>of how at this very time the East was to grow powerful, and rulers, coming 
<A NAME="285"></A>from Judaea, were to acquire universal empire. These mysterious prophecies 
<A NAME="286"></A>had pointed to Vespasian and Titus, but the common people, with the usual 
<A NAME="287"></A>blindness of ambition, had interpreted these mighty destinies of themselves, 
<A NAME="288"></A>and could not be brought even by disasters to believe the truth. I have 
<A NAME="289"></A>heard that the total number of the besieged, of every age and both sexes, 
<A NAME="290"></A>amounted to six hundred thousand. All who were able bore arms, and a number, 
<A NAME="291"></A>more than proportionate to the population, had the courage to do so. Men 
<A NAME="292"></A>and women showed equal resolution, and life seemed more terrible than death, 
<A NAME="293"></A>if they were to be forced to leave their country. Such was this city and 
<A NAME="294"></A>nation; and Titus Caesar, seeing that the position forbad an assault or 
<A NAME="295"></A>any of the more rapid operations of war, determined to proceed by earthworks 
<A NAME="296"></A>and covered approaches. The legions had their respective duties assigned 
<A NAME="297"></A>to them, and there was a cessation from fighting, till all the inventions, 
<A NAME="298"></A>used in ancient warfare, or devised by modern ingenuity for the reduction 
<A NAME="299"></A>of cities, were constructed.
<A NAME="300"></A><BR><BR>Meanwhile Civilis, having recruited his army from Germany after 
<A NAME="301"></A>his defeat among the Treveri, took up his position at the Old Camp, where 
<A NAME="302"></A>his situation would protect him, and where the courage of his barbarian 
<A NAME="303"></A>troops would be raised by the recollection of successes gained on the spot. 
<A NAME="304"></A>He was followed to this place by Cerialis, whose forces had now been doubled 
<A NAME="305"></A>by the arrival of the 2nd, 6th, and 14th legions. The auxiliary infantry 
<A NAME="306"></A>and cavalry, summoned long before, had hastened to join him after his victory. 
<A NAME="307"></A>Neither of the generals loved delay. But a wide extent of plain naturally 
<A NAME="308"></A>saturated with water kept them apart. Civilis had also thrown a dam obliquely 
<A NAME="309"></A>across the Rhine, so that the stream, diverted by the obstacle, might overflow 
<A NAME="310"></A>the adjacent country. Such was the character of the district, full of hidden 
<A NAME="311"></A>perils from the varying depth of the fords, and unfavourable to our troops. 
<A NAME="312"></A>The Roman soldier is heavily armed and afraid to swim, while the German, 
<A NAME="313"></A>who is accustomed to rivers, is favoured by the lightness of his equipment 
<A NAME="314"></A>and the height of his stature.
<A NAME="315"></A><BR><BR>The Batavi provoking a conflict, the struggle was at once begun 
<A NAME="316"></A>by all the boldest spirits among our troops, but a panic arose, when they 
<A NAME="317"></A>saw arms and horses swallowed up in the vast depths of the marshes. The 
<A NAME="318"></A>Germans leapt lightly through the well-known shallows, and frequently, 
<A NAME="319"></A>quitting the front, hung on the rear and flanks of our army. It was neither 
<A NAME="320"></A>the close nor the distant fighting of a land-battle; it was more like a 
<A NAME="321"></A>naval contest. Struggling among the waters, or exerting every limb where 
<A NAME="322"></A>they found any firm footing, the wounded and the unhurt, those who could 
<A NAME="323"></A>swim and those who could not, were involved in one common destruction. 
<A NAME="324"></A>The loss however was less than might have been expected from the confusion, 
<A NAME="325"></A>for the Germans, not venturing to leave the morass, returned to their camp. 
<A NAME="326"></A>The result of this battle roused both generals, though from different motives, 
<A NAME="327"></A>to hasten on the final struggle. Civilis was anxious to follow up his success; 
<A NAME="328"></A>Cerialis to wipe out his disgrace. The Germans were flushed with success; 
<A NAME="329"></A>the Romans were thoroughly roused by shame. The barbarians spent the night 
<A NAME="330"></A>in singing and shouting; our men in rage and threats of 
<A NAME="331"></A>vengeance.
<A NAME="332"></A><BR><BR>Next morning Cerialis formed his front with the cavalry and auxiliary 
<A NAME="333"></A>infantry; in the second line were posted the legions, the general reserving 
<A NAME="334"></A>a picked force for unforeseen contingencies. Civilis confronted him with 
<A NAME="335"></A>his troops ranged, not in line, but in columns. On the right were the Batavi 
<A NAME="336"></A>and the Gugerni; the left, which was nearer the river, was occupied by 
<A NAME="337"></A>the Transrhenane tribes. The exhortations of the generals were not addressed 
<A NAME="338"></A>as formal harangues to the assembled armies, but to the divisions separately, 
<A NAME="339"></A>as they rode along the line. Cerialis spoke of the old glory of the Roman 
<A NAME="340"></A>name, of former and of recent victories; he told them that in destroying 
<A NAME="341"></A>for ever their treacherous, cowardly, and beaten foe, they had to execute 
<A NAME="342"></A>a punishment, rather than to fight a battle. They had lately contended 
<A NAME="343"></A>with a superior force, and yet the Germans, the strength of the hostile 
<A NAME="344"></A>army, had been routed; a few were left, who carried terror in their hearts 
<A NAME="345"></A>and scars upon their backs. He addressed to the several legions appropriate 
<A NAME="346"></A>appeals. The 14th were styled the "Conquerors of Britain"; the powerful 
<A NAME="347"></A>influence of the 6th had made Galba Emperor; the men of the 2nd were in 
<A NAME="348"></A>that battle first to consecrate their new standards and new eagle. Then 
<A NAME="349"></A>riding up to the army of Germany, he stretched forth his hand, and implored 
<A NAME="350"></A>them to recover their river bank and their camp by the slaughter of the 
<A NAME="351"></A>foe. A joyful shout arose from the whole army, some of whom after long 
<A NAME="352"></A>peace lusted for battle, while others, weary of war, desired peace; all 
<A NAME="353"></A>were looking for rewards and for future repose.
<A NAME="354"></A><BR><BR>Nor did Civilis marshal his army in silence. He called the field 
<A NAME="355"></A>of battle to bear witness to their valour. He told the Germans and Batavians 
<A NAME="356"></A>that they were standing on the monuments of their glory, that they were 
<A NAME="357"></A>treading under foot the ashes and bones of legions. "Wherever," he said, 
<A NAME="358"></A>"the Roman turns his eyes, captivity, disaster, and everything that is 
<A NAME="359"></A>terrible, confront him. Do not be alarmed by the adverse result of the 
<A NAME="360"></A>battle among the Treveri. There, their own success proved hurtful to the 
<A NAME="361"></A>Germans, for, throwing away their arms, they hampered their hands with 
<A NAME="362"></A>plunder. Since then everything has been favourable to us, and against the 
<A NAME="363"></A>foe. All precautions, which the skill of a general should take, have been 
<A NAME="364"></A>taken. Here are these flooded plains which we know so well, here the marshes 
<A NAME="365"></A>so fatal to the enemy. The Rhine and the Gods of Germany are in your sight. 
<A NAME="366"></A>Under their auspices give battle, remembering your wives, your parents, 
<A NAME="367"></A>and your father-land. This day will either be the most glorious among the 
<A NAME="368"></A>deeds of the past, or will be infamous in the eyes of posterity." These 
<A NAME="369"></A>words were hailed, according to their custom, with the clash of arms and 
<A NAME="370"></A>with wild antics, and then the battle was commenced by a discharge of stones, 
<A NAME="371"></A>leaden balls, and other missiles, our soldiers not entering the morass, 
<A NAME="372"></A>while the Germans sought to provoke, and so draw them 
<A NAME="373"></A>on.
<A NAME="374"></A><BR><BR>When their store of missiles was spent, and the battle grew hotter, 
<A NAME="375"></A>a fiercer onslaught was made by the enemy. Their tall stature and very 
<A NAME="376"></A>long spears enabled them, without closing, to wound our men, who were wavering 
<A NAME="377"></A>and unsteady. At the same time a column of the Bructeri swam across from 
<A NAME="378"></A>the dam, which I have described as carried out into the river. Here there 
<A NAME="379"></A>was some confusion. The line of the allied infantry was being driven back, 
<A NAME="380"></A>when the legions took up the contest. The fury of the enemy was checked, 
<A NAME="381"></A>and the battle again became equal. At the same time a Batavian deserter 
<A NAME="382"></A>came up to Cerialis, offering an opportunity of attacking the enemy's rear, 
<A NAME="383"></A>if some cavalry were sent along the edge of the morass. The ground there 
<A NAME="384"></A>was firm, and the Gugerni, to whom the post had been allotted, were careless. 
<A NAME="385"></A>Two squadrons were sent with the deserter, and outflanked the unsuspecting 
<A NAME="386"></A>enemy. At the shout that announced this success, the legions charged in 
<A NAME="387"></A>front. The Germans were routed, and fled towards the Rhine. The war would 
<A NAME="388"></A>have been finished that day, if the fleet had hastened to come up. As it 
<A NAME="389"></A>was, the cavalry did not pursue, for a storm of rain suddenly fell, and 
<A NAME="390"></A>night was at hand.
<A NAME="391"></A><BR><BR>The next day the 14th legion was sent into the Upper Province to 
<A NAME="392"></A>join Gallus Annius. The 10th, which had arrived from Spain, supplied its 
<A NAME="393"></A>place in the army of Cerialis. Civilis was joined by some auxiliaries from 
<A NAME="394"></A>the Chauci. Nevertheless he did not venture to fight for the defence of 
<A NAME="395"></A>the Batavian capital, but carrying off property that could be removed, 
<A NAME="396"></A>and setting fire to the remainder, he retreated into the island, aware 
<A NAME="397"></A>that there were not vessels enough for constructing a bridge, and that 
<A NAME="398"></A>the Roman army could not cross the river in any other way. He also demolished 
<A NAME="399"></A>the dyke, constructed by Drusus Germanicus, and, by destroying this barrier, 
<A NAME="400"></A>sent the river flowing down a steep channel on the side of Gaul. The river 
<A NAME="401"></A>having been thus, so to speak, diverted, the narrowness of the channel 
<A NAME="402"></A>between the island and Germany created an appearance of an uninterrupted 
<A NAME="403"></A>surface of dry ground. Tutor, Classicus, and one hundred and thirteen senators 
<A NAME="404"></A>of the Treveri, also crossed the Rhine. Among them was Alpinius Montanus, 
<A NAME="405"></A>of whose mission into Gaul by Antonius I have already spoken. He was accompanied 
<A NAME="406"></A>by his brother Decimus Alpinius. His other adherents were now endeavouring 
<A NAME="407"></A>to collect auxiliaries among these danger-loving tribes by appeals to their 
<A NAME="408"></A>pity and their greed.
<A NAME="409"></A><BR><BR>The war was so far from being at an end, that Civilis in one day 
<A NAME="410"></A>attacked on four points the positions of the auxiliary infantry and cavalry 
<A NAME="411"></A>and of the legions, assailing the tenth legion at Arenacum, the second 
<A NAME="412"></A>at Batavodurum, and the camp of the auxiliary infantry and cavalry at Grinnes 
<A NAME="413"></A>and Vada, and so dividing his forces, that he himself, his sister's son 
<A NAME="414"></A>Verax, Classicus, and Tutor, led each his own division. They were not confident 
<A NAME="415"></A>of accomplishing all these objects, but they hoped that, if they made many 
<A NAME="416"></A>ventures, fortune would favour them on some one point. Besides, Cerialis 
<A NAME="417"></A>was not cautious, and might easily be intercepted, as the multiplicity 
<A NAME="418"></A>of tidings hurried him from place to place. The force, which had to attack 
<A NAME="419"></A>the tenth legion, thinking it a hard matter to storm a legionary encampment, 
<A NAME="420"></A>surprised some troops, who had gone out, and were busy felling timber, 
<A NAME="421"></A>killed the prefect of the camp, five centurions of the first rank, and 
<A NAME="422"></A>a few soldiers; the rest found shelter behind the fortifications. At Batavodurum 
<A NAME="423"></A>the German troops tried to break down the bridge partly built. Night terminated 
<A NAME="424"></A>an indecisive conflict.
<A NAME="425"></A><BR><BR>There was greater danger at Grinnes and Vada. Civilis attacked 
<A NAME="426"></A>Vada, Classicus Grinnes, and they could not be checked, for our bravest 
<A NAME="427"></A>men had fallen, among them Briganticus, who commanded a squadron of cavalry, 
<A NAME="428"></A>and of whose loyalty to the Roman cause and enmity to his uncle Civilis 
<A NAME="429"></A>I have already spoken. But when Cerialis came up with a picked body of 
<A NAME="430"></A>cavalry, the fortune of the day changed, and the Germans were driven headlong 
<A NAME="431"></A>into the river. Civilis, who was recognised while seeking to stop his flying 
<A NAME="432"></A>troops, became the mark of many missiles, left his horse, and swam across 
<A NAME="433"></A>the river. Verax escaped in the same way. Some light vessels were brought 
<A NAME="434"></A>up, and carried off Tutor and Classicus. Even on this occasion the Roman 
<A NAME="435"></A>fleet was not present at the engagement, though orders had been given to 
<A NAME="436"></A>that effect. Fear kept them away, and their crews were dispersed about 
<A NAME="437"></A>other military duties. Cerialis in fact allowed too little time for executing 
<A NAME="438"></A>his commands; he was hasty in his plans, though eminently successful in 
<A NAME="439"></A>their results. Fortune helped him even where skill had failed, and so both 
<A NAME="440"></A>the general and his army became less careful about discipline. A few days 
<A NAME="441"></A>after this he escaped the peril of actual capture, but not without great 
<A NAME="442"></A>disgrace.
<A NAME="443"></A><BR><BR>He had gone to Novesium and Bonna, to inspect the camps which were 
<A NAME="444"></A>then in course of erection for the winter abode of the legions, and was 
<A NAME="445"></A>making his way back with the fleet, his escort being in disorder, and his 
<A NAME="446"></A>sentries negligent. This was observed by the Germans, and they planned 
<A NAME="447"></A>a surprise. They chose a dark and cloudy night, and moving rapidly down 
<A NAME="448"></A>the stream, entered the entrenchments without opposition. The carnage was 
<A NAME="449"></A>at first helped on by a cunning device. They cut the ropes of the tents, 
<A NAME="450"></A>and slaughtered the soldiers as they lay buried beneath their own dwellings. 
<A NAME="451"></A>Another force put the fleet into confusion, threw their grapling irons 
<A NAME="452"></A>on the vessels, and dragged them away by the sterns. They sought at first 
<A NAME="453"></A>to elude notice by silence, but when the slaughter was begun, by way of 
<A NAME="454"></A>increasing the panic they raised on all sides a deafening shout. The Romans, 
<A NAME="455"></A>awakened by sounds, looked for their arms and rushed through the passages 
<A NAME="456"></A>of the camp, some few with their proper accoutrements, but most with their 
<A NAME="457"></A>garments wrapped round their shoulders, and with drawn swords in their 
<A NAME="458"></A>hands. The general, who was half asleep, and all but naked, was saved by 
<A NAME="459"></A>the enemy's mistake. They carried off the praetorian vessel, which was 
<A NAME="460"></A>distinguished by a flag, believing that the general was on board. Cerialis 
<A NAME="461"></A>indeed had passed the night elsewhere, in the company, as many believed, 
<A NAME="462"></A>of an Ubian woman, Claudia Sacrata. The sentinels sought to excuse their 
<A NAME="463"></A>own scandalous neglect by the disgraceful conduct of the general, alleging 
<A NAME="464"></A>that they had been ordered to be silent, that they might not disturb his 
<A NAME="465"></A>rest, and that, from omitting the watchwords and the usual challenges, 
<A NAME="466"></A>they had themselves fallen asleep. The enemy rowed back in broad daylight 
<A NAME="467"></A>with the captured vessels. The praetorian trireme they towed up the river 
<A NAME="468"></A>Lupia as a present to Veleda.
<A NAME="469"></A><BR><BR>Civilis was seized by a desire to make a naval demonstration. He 
<A NAME="470"></A>manned all the triremes that he had, and such vessels as were propelled 
<A NAME="471"></A>by a single bank of oars. To these he added a vast number of boats. He 
<A NAME="472"></A>put in each three or four hundred men, the usual complement of a Liburnian 
<A NAME="473"></A>galley. With these were the captured vessels, in which, picturesquely enough, 
<A NAME="474"></A>plaids of various colours were used for sails. The place selected was an 
<A NAME="475"></A>expanse of water, not unlike the sea, where the mouth of the Mosa serves 
<A NAME="476"></A>to discharge the Rhine into the ocean. The motive for equipping this fleet 
<A NAME="477"></A>was, to say nothing of the natural vanity of this people, a desire to intercept, 
<A NAME="478"></A>by this alarming demonstration, the supplies that were approaching from 
<A NAME="479"></A>Gaul. Cerialis, more in astonishment than alarm, drew up his fleet in line, 
<A NAME="480"></A>and, though inferior in numbers, it had the advantage in the experience 
<A NAME="481"></A>of the crews, the skill of the pilots, and the size of the vessels. The 
<A NAME="482"></A>Romans had the stream with them, the enemy's vessels were propelled by 
<A NAME="483"></A>the wind. Thus passing each other, they separated after a brief discharge 
<A NAME="484"></A>of light missiles. Civilis attempted nothing more, and retired to the other 
<A NAME="485"></A>side of the Rhine. Cerialis mercilessly ravaged the Island of the Batavi, 
<A NAME="486"></A>but, with a policy familiar to commanders, left untouched the estates and 
<A NAME="487"></A>houses of Civilis. Meanwhile, however, the autumn was far advanced, and 
<A NAME="488"></A>the river, swollen by the continual rains of the season, overflowed the 
<A NAME="489"></A>island, marshy and low-lying as it is, till it resembled a lake. There 
<A NAME="490"></A>were no ships, no provisions at hand, and the camp, which was situated 
<A NAME="491"></A>on low ground, was in process of being carried away by the force of the 
<A NAME="492"></A>stream.
<A NAME="493"></A><BR><BR>That the legions might then have been crushed, and that the Germans 
<A NAME="494"></A>wished to crush them, but were turned from their purpose by his own craft, 
<A NAME="495"></A>was claimed as a merit by Civilis; nor is it unlike the truth, since a 
<A NAME="496"></A>capitulation followed in a few days. Cerialis, sending secret emissaries, 
<A NAME="497"></A>had held out the prospect of peace to the Batavi, and of pardon to Civilis, 
<A NAME="498"></A>while he advised Veleda and her relatives to change by a well-timed service 
<A NAME="499"></A>to the Roman people the fortune of war, which so many disasters had shewn 
<A NAME="500"></A>to be adverse. He reminded them that the Treveri had been beaten, that 
<A NAME="501"></A>the Ubii had submitted, that the Batavi had had their country taken from 
<A NAME="502"></A>them, and that from the friendship of Civilis nothing else had been gained 
<A NAME="503"></A>but wounds, defeat, and mourning; an exile and a fugitive he could only 
<A NAME="504"></A>be a burden to those who entertained him, and they had already trespassed 
<A NAME="505"></A>enough in crossing the Rhine so often. If they attempted anything more, 
<A NAME="506"></A>on their side would be the wrong and the guilt, with the Romans the vengeance 
<A NAME="507"></A>of heaven.
<A NAME="508"></A><BR><BR>Thus promises were mingled with threats. When the fidelity of the 
<A NAME="509"></A>Transrhenane tribes had been thus shaken, among the Batavi also there arose 
<A NAME="510"></A>debates. "We can no longer," they said, "postpone our ruin. The servitude 
<A NAME="511"></A>of the whole world cannot be averted by a single nation. What has been 
<A NAME="512"></A>accomplished by destroying legions with fire and sword, but that more legions 
<A NAME="513"></A>and stronger have been brought up? If it was for Vespasian that we fought 
<A NAME="514"></A>this war, then Vespasian rules the world; if we meant to challenge to battle 
<A NAME="515"></A>the Roman people, then what a mere fraction of the human race are the Batavi! 
<A NAME="516"></A>Look at the Rhaetians and Noricans, at the burdens borne by the other allies. 
<A NAME="517"></A>No tribute, but valour and manhood are demanded of us. This is the next 
<A NAME="518"></A>thing to liberty, and if we must choose between masters, then we may more 
<A NAME="519"></A>honourably bear with the Emperors of Rome, than with the women of the Germans." 
<A NAME="520"></A>Such were the murmurs of the lower class; the nobles spoke in fiercer language. 
<A NAME="521"></A>"We have been driven into war," they said, "by the fury of Civilis. He 
<A NAME="522"></A>sought to counterbalance his private wrongs by the destruction of his nation. 
<A NAME="523"></A>Then were the Gods angry with the Batavi when the legions were besieged, 
<A NAME="524"></A>when the legates were slain, when the war, so necessary to that one man, 
<A NAME="525"></A>so fatal to us, was begun. We are at the last extremity, unless we think 
<A NAME="526"></A>of repenting, and avow our repentance by punishing the 
<A NAME="527"></A>guilty."
<A NAME="528"></A><BR><BR>These dispositions did not escape the notice of Civilis. He determined 
<A NAME="529"></A>to anticipate them, moved not only by weariness of his sufferings, but 
<A NAME="530"></A>also by that clinging to life which often breaks the noblest spirits. He 
<A NAME="531"></A>asked for a conference. The bridge over the river Nabalia was cut down, 
<A NAME="532"></A>and the two generals advanced to the broken extremities. Civilis thus opened 
<A NAME="533"></A>the conference:- "If it were before a legate of Vitellius that I were defending 
<A NAME="534"></A>myself, my acts would deserve no pardon, my words no credit. All the relations 
<A NAME="535"></A>between us were those of hatred and hostility, first made so by him, and 
<A NAME="536"></A>afterwards embittered by me. My respect for Vespasian is of long standing. 
<A NAME="537"></A>While he was still a subject, we were called friends. This was known to 
<A NAME="538"></A>Primus Antonius, whose letters urged me to take up arms, for he feared 
<A NAME="539"></A>lest the legions of Germany and the youth of Gaul should cross the Alps. 
<A NAME="540"></A>What Antonius advised by his letters, Hordeonius suggested by word of mouth. 
<A NAME="541"></A>I fought the same battle in Germany, as did Mucianus in Syria, Aponius 
<A NAME="542"></A>in Moesia, Flavianus in Pannonia."
<A NAME="543"></A><BR><BR>[At this point the Histories break off. We do not know what happened 
<A NAME="544"></A>to Civilis. The Batavians seem to have received favorable 
<A NAME="545"></A>treatment.]
