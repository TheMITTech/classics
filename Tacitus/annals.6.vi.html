<A NAME="start"></A>
<A NAME="10"></A>A.D. 32-37
<A NAME="11"></A><BR><BR>Cneius Domitius and Camillus Scribonianus had entered on the consulship 
<A NAME="12"></A>when the emperor, after crossing the channel which divides Capreae from 
<A NAME="13"></A>Surrentum, sailed along Campania, in doubt whether he should enter Rome, 
<A NAME="14"></A>or, possibly, simulating the intention of going thither, because he had 
<A NAME="15"></A>resolved otherwise. He often landed at points in the neighborhood, visited 
<A NAME="16"></A>the gardens by the Tiber, but went back again to the cliffs and to the 
<A NAME="17"></A>solitude of the sea shores, in shame at the vices and profligacies into 
<A NAME="18"></A>which he had plunged so unrestrainedly that in the fashion of a despot 
<A NAME="19"></A>he debauched the children of free-born citizens. It was not merely beauty 
<A NAME="20"></A>and a handsome person which he felt as an incentive to his lust, but the 
<A NAME="21"></A>modesty of childhood in some, and noble ancestry in others. Hitherto unknown 
<A NAME="22"></A>terms were then for the first time invented, derived from the abominations 
<A NAME="23"></A>of the place and the endless phases of sensuality. Slaves too were set 
<A NAME="24"></A>over the work of seeking out and procuring, with rewards for the willing, 
<A NAME="25"></A>and threats to the reluctant, and if there was resistance from a relative 
<A NAME="26"></A>or a parent, they used violence and force, and actually indulged their 
<A NAME="27"></A>own passions as if dealing with captives.
<A NAME="28"></A><BR><BR>At Rome meanwhile, in the beginning of the year, as if Livia's 
<A NAME="29"></A>crimes had just been discovered and not also long ago punished, terrible 
<A NAME="30"></A>decrees were proposed against her very statues and memory, and the property 
<A NAME="31"></A>of Sejanus was to be taken from the exchequer and transferred to the imperial 
<A NAME="32"></A>treasury; as if there was any difference. The motion was being urged with 
<A NAME="33"></A>extreme persistency, in almost the same or with but slightly changed language, 
<A NAME="34"></A>by such men as Scipio, Silanus, and Cassius, when suddenly Togonius Gallus 
<A NAME="35"></A>intruding his own obscurity among illustrious names, was heard with ridicule. 
<A NAME="36"></A>He begged the emperor to select a number of senators, twenty out of whom 
<A NAME="37"></A>should be chosen by lot to wear swords and to defend his person, whenever 
<A NAME="38"></A>he entered the Senate House. The man had actually believed a letter from 
<A NAME="39"></A>him in which he asked the protection of one of the consuls, so that he 
<A NAME="40"></A>might go in safety from Capreae to Rome. Tiberius however, who usually 
<A NAME="41"></A>combined jesting and seriousness, thanked the senators for their goodwill, 
<A NAME="42"></A>but asked who could be rejected, who could be chosen? "Were they always 
<A NAME="43"></A>to be the same, or was there to be a succession? Were they to be men who 
<A NAME="44"></A>had held office or youths, private citizens or officials? Then, again, 
<A NAME="45"></A>what a scene would be presented by persons grasping their swords on the 
<A NAME="46"></A>threshold of the Senate House? His life was not of so much worth if it 
<A NAME="47"></A>had to be defended by arms." This was his answer to Togonius, guarded in 
<A NAME="48"></A>its expression, and he urged nothing beyond the rejection of the 
<A NAME="49"></A>motion.
<A NAME="50"></A><BR><BR>Junius Gallio however, who had proposed that the praetorian soldiers, 
<A NAME="51"></A>after having served their campaigns, should acquire the privilege of sitting 
<A NAME="52"></A>in the fourteen rows of the theatre, received a savage censure. Tiberius, 
<A NAME="53"></A>just as if he were face to face with him, asked what he had to do with 
<A NAME="54"></A>the soldiers, who ought to receive the emperor's orders or his rewards 
<A NAME="55"></A>except from the emperor himself? He had really discovered something which 
<A NAME="56"></A>the Divine Augustus had not foreseen. Or was not one of Sejanus's satellites 
<A NAME="57"></A>rather seeking to sow discord and sedition, as a means of prompting ignorant 
<A NAME="58"></A>minds, under the pretence of compliment, to ruin military discipline? This 
<A NAME="59"></A>was Gallio's recompense for his carefully prepared flattery, with immediate 
<A NAME="60"></A>expulsion from the Senate, and then from Italy. And as men complained that 
<A NAME="61"></A>he would endure his exile with equanimity, since he had chosen the famous 
<A NAME="62"></A>and lovely island of Lesbos, he was dragged back to Rome, and confined 
<A NAME="63"></A>in the houses of different officials.
<A NAME="64"></A><BR><BR>The emperor in the same letter crushed Sextius Paconianus, an ex-praetor, 
<A NAME="65"></A>to the great joy of the senators, as he was a daring, mischievous man, 
<A NAME="66"></A>who pryed into every person's secrets, and had been the chosen instrument 
<A NAME="67"></A>of Sejanus in his treacherous designs against Caius Caesar. When this fact 
<A NAME="68"></A>was divulged, there came an outburst of long-concealed hatreds, and there 
<A NAME="69"></A>must have been a sentence of capital punishment, had he not himself volunteered 
<A NAME="70"></A>a disclosure.
<A NAME="71"></A><BR><BR>As soon as he named Latinius Latiaris, accuser and accused, both 
<A NAME="72"></A>alike objects of execration, presented a most welcome spectacle. Latiaris, 
<A NAME="73"></A>as I have related, had been foremost in contriving the ruin of Titius Sabinus, 
<A NAME="74"></A>and was now the first to pay the penalty. By way of episode, Haterius Agrippa 
<A NAME="75"></A>inveighed against the consuls of the previous year for now sitting silent 
<A NAME="76"></A>after their threats of impeaching one another. "It must be fear," he said, 
<A NAME="77"></A>"and a guilty conscience which are acting as a bond of union. But the senators 
<A NAME="78"></A>must not keep back what they have heard." Regulus replied that he was awaiting 
<A NAME="79"></A>the opportunity for vengeance, and meant to press it in the emperor's presence. 
<A NAME="80"></A>Trio's answer was that it was best to efface the memory of rivalries between 
<A NAME="81"></A>colleagues, and of any words uttered in quarrels. When Agrippa still persisted, 
<A NAME="82"></A>Sanquinius Maximus, one of the ex-consuls, implored the Senate not to increase 
<A NAME="83"></A>the emperor's anxieties by seeking further occasions of bitterness, as 
<A NAME="84"></A>he was himself competent to provide remedies. This secured the safety of 
<A NAME="85"></A>Regulus and the postponement of Trio's ruin. Haterius was hated all the 
<A NAME="86"></A>more. Wan with untimely slumbers and nights of riot, and not fearing in 
<A NAME="87"></A>his indolence even the cruellest of princes, he yet plotted amid his gluttony 
<A NAME="88"></A>and lust the destruction of illustrious men.
<A NAME="89"></A><BR><BR>Several charges were next brought, as soon as the opportunity offered, 
<A NAME="90"></A>against Cotta Messalinus, the author of every unusually cruel proposal, 
<A NAME="91"></A>and consequently, regarded with inveterate hatred. He had spoken, it was 
<A NAME="92"></A>said, of Caius Caesar, as if it were a question whether he was a man, and 
<A NAME="93"></A>of an entertainment at which he was present on Augusta's birthday with 
<A NAME="94"></A>the priests, as a funeral banquet. In remonstrating too against the influence 
<A NAME="95"></A>of Marcus Lepidus and Lucius Arruntius, with whom he had disputes on many 
<A NAME="96"></A>matters, he had added the remark, "They will have the Senate's support; 
<A NAME="97"></A>I shall have that of my darling Tiberius." But the leading men of the State 
<A NAME="98"></A>failed to convict him on all the charges. When they pressed the case, he 
<A NAME="99"></A>appealed to the emperor. Soon afterwards, a letter arrived, in which Tiberius 
<A NAME="100"></A>traced the origin of the friendship between himself and Cotta, enumerated 
<A NAME="101"></A>his frequent services, and then requested that words perversely misrepresented 
<A NAME="102"></A>and the freedom of table talk might not be construed into a 
<A NAME="103"></A>crime.
<A NAME="104"></A><BR><BR>The beginning of the emperor's letter seemed very striking. It 
<A NAME="105"></A>opened thus: "May all the gods and goddesses destroy me more miserably 
<A NAME="106"></A>than I feel myself to be daily perishing, if I know at know at this moment 
<A NAME="107"></A>what to write to you, Senators, how to write it, or what, in short, not 
<A NAME="108"></A>to write." So completely had his crimes and infamies recoiled, as a penalty, 
<A NAME="109"></A>on himself. With profound meaning was it often affirmed by the greatest 
<A NAME="110"></A>teacher of philosophy that, could the minds of tyrants be laid bare, there 
<A NAME="111"></A>would be seen gashes and wounds; for, as the body is lacerated by scourging, 
<A NAME="112"></A>so is the spirit by brutality, by lust and by evil thoughts. Assuredly 
<A NAME="113"></A>Tiberius was not saved by his elevation or his solitude from having to 
<A NAME="114"></A>confess the anguish of his heart and his self-inflicted 
<A NAME="115"></A>punishment.
<A NAME="116"></A><BR><BR>Authority was then given to the Senate to decide the case of Caecilianus, 
<A NAME="117"></A>one of its members, the chief witness against Cotta, and it was agreed 
<A NAME="118"></A>that the same penalty should be inflicted as on Aruseius and Sanquinius, 
<A NAME="119"></A>the accusers of Lucius Arruntius. Nothing ever happened to Cotta more to 
<A NAME="120"></A>his distinction. Of noble birth, but beggared by extravagance and infamous 
<A NAME="121"></A>for his excesses, he was now by dignity of his revenge, raised to a level 
<A NAME="122"></A>with the stainless virtues of Arruntius.
<A NAME="123"></A><BR><BR>Quintus Servaeus and Minucius Thermus were next arraigned. Servaeus 
<A NAME="124"></A>was an ex-praetor, and had formerly been a companion of Germanicus; Minucius 
<A NAME="125"></A>was of equestrian rank, and both had enjoyed, though discreetly, the friendship 
<A NAME="126"></A>of Sejanus. Hence they were the more pitied. Tiberius, on the contrary, 
<A NAME="127"></A>denounced them as foremost in crime, and bade Caius Cestius, the elder, 
<A NAME="128"></A>tell the Senate what he had communicated to the emperor by letter. Cestius 
<A NAME="129"></A>undertook the prosecution. And this was the most dreadful feature of the 
<A NAME="130"></A>age, that leading members of the Senate, some openly, some secretly employed 
<A NAME="131"></A>themselves in the very lowest work of the informer. One could not distinguish 
<A NAME="132"></A>between aliens and kinsfolk, between friends and strangers, or say what 
<A NAME="133"></A>was quite recent, or what half-forgotten from lapse of time. People were 
<A NAME="134"></A>incriminated for some casual remark in the forum or at the dinner-table, 
<A NAME="135"></A>for every one was impatient to be the first to mark his victim, some to 
<A NAME="136"></A>screen themselves, most from being, as it were, infected with the contagion 
<A NAME="137"></A>of the malady.
<A NAME="138"></A><BR><BR>Minucius and Servaeus, on being condemned, went over to the prosecution, 
<A NAME="139"></A>and then Julius Africanus with Seius Quadratus were dragged into the same 
<A NAME="140"></A>ruin. Africanus was from the Santones, one of the states of Gaul; the origin 
<A NAME="141"></A>of Quadratus I have not ascertained. Many authors, I am well aware, have 
<A NAME="142"></A>passed over the perils and punishments of a host of persons, sickened by 
<A NAME="143"></A>the multiplicity of them, or fearing that what they had themselves found 
<A NAME="144"></A>wearisome and saddening would be equally fatiguing to their readers. For 
<A NAME="145"></A>myself, I have lighted on many facts worth knowing, though other writers 
<A NAME="146"></A>have not recorded them.
<A NAME="147"></A><BR><BR>A Roman knight, Marcus Terentius, at the crisis when all others 
<A NAME="148"></A>had hypocritically repudiated the friendship of Sejanus, dared, when impeached 
<A NAME="149"></A>on that ground, to cling to it by the following avowal to the Senate: "In 
<A NAME="150"></A>my position it is perhaps less to my advantage to acknowledge than to deny 
<A NAME="151"></A>the charge. Still, whatever is to be the issue of the matter, I shall admit 
<A NAME="152"></A>that I was the friend of Sejanus, that I anxiously sought to be such, and 
<A NAME="153"></A>was delighted when I was successful. I had seen him his father's colleague 
<A NAME="154"></A>in the command of the praetorian cohorts, and subsequently combining the 
<A NAME="155"></A>duties of civil and military life. His kinsfolk and connections were loaded 
<A NAME="156"></A>with honours; intimacy with Sejanus was in every case a powerful recommendation 
<A NAME="157"></A>to the emperor's friendship. Those, on the contrary, whom he hated, had 
<A NAME="158"></A>to struggle with danger and humiliation. I take no individual as an instance. 
<A NAME="159"></A>All of us who had no part in his last design, I mean to defend at the peril 
<A NAME="160"></A>of myself alone. It was really not Sejanus of Vulsinii, it was a member 
<A NAME="161"></A>of the Claudian and Julian houses, in which he had taken a position by 
<A NAME="162"></A>his marriage-alliance, it was your son-in-law, Caesar, your partner in 
<A NAME="163"></A>the consulship, the man who administered your political functions, whom 
<A NAME="164"></A>we courted. It is not for us to criticise one whom you may raise above 
<A NAME="165"></A>all others, or your motives for so doing. Heaven has intrusted you with 
<A NAME="166"></A>the supreme decision of affairs, and for us is left the glory of obedience. 
<A NAME="167"></A>And, again, we see what takes place before our eyes, who it is on whom 
<A NAME="168"></A>you bestow riches and honours, who are the most powerful to help or to 
<A NAME="169"></A>injure. That Sejanus was such, no one will deny. To explore the prince's 
<A NAME="170"></A>secret thoughts, or any of his hidden plans, is a forbidden, a dangerous 
<A NAME="171"></A>thing, nor does it follow that one could reach them.
<A NAME="172"></A><BR><BR>"Do not, Senators, think only of Sejanus's last day, but of his 
<A NAME="173"></A>sixteen years of power. We actually adored a Satrius and a Pomponius. To 
<A NAME="174"></A>be known even to his freedmen and hall-porters was thought something very 
<A NAME="175"></A>grand. What then is my meaning? Is this apology meant to be offered for 
<A NAME="176"></A>all without difference and discrimination? No; it is to be restricted within 
<A NAME="177"></A>proper limits. Let plots against the State, murderous designs against the 
<A NAME="178"></A>emperor be punished. As for friendship and its obligations, the same principle 
<A NAME="179"></A>must acquit both you, Caesar, and us."
<A NAME="180"></A><BR><BR>The courage of this speech and the fact that there had been found 
<A NAME="181"></A>a man to speak out what was in all people's thoughts, had such an effect 
<A NAME="182"></A>that the accusers of Terentius were sentenced to banishment or death, their 
<A NAME="183"></A>previous offences being taken into account. Then came a letter from Tiberius 
<A NAME="184"></A>against Sextus Vestilius, an ex-praetor, whom, as a special favourite of 
<A NAME="185"></A>his brother Drusus, the emperor had admitted into his own select circle. 
<A NAME="186"></A>His reason for being displeased with Vestilius was that he had either written 
<A NAME="187"></A>an attack on Caius Caesar as a profligate, or that Tiberius believed a 
<A NAME="188"></A>false charge. For this Vestilius was excluded from the prince's table. 
<A NAME="189"></A>He then tried the knife with his aged hand, but again bound up his veins, 
<A NAME="190"></A>opening them once more however on having begged for pardon by letter and 
<A NAME="191"></A>received a pitiless answer. After him a host of persons were charged with 
<A NAME="192"></A>treason, Annius Pollio, Appius Silanus, Scaurus Mamercus, Sabinus Calvisius, 
<A NAME="193"></A>Vinicianus too, coupled with Pollio, his father, men all of illustrious 
<A NAME="194"></A>descent, some too of the highest political distinction. The senators were 
<A NAME="195"></A>panic-stricken, for how few of their number were not connected by alliance 
<A NAME="196"></A>or by friendship with this multitude of men of rank! Celsus however, tribune 
<A NAME="197"></A>of a city cohort, and now one of the prosecutors, saved Appius and Calvisius 
<A NAME="198"></A>from the peril. The emperor postponed the cases of Pollio, Vinicianus, 
<A NAME="199"></A>and Scaurus, intending to try them himself with the Senate, not however 
<A NAME="200"></A>without affixing some ominous marks to the name of Scaurus.
<A NAME="201"></A><BR><BR>Even women were not exempt from danger. Where they could not be 
<A NAME="202"></A>accused of grasping at political power, their tears were made a crime. 
<A NAME="203"></A>Vitia, an aged woman, mother of Fufius Geminus, was executed for bewailing 
<A NAME="204"></A>the death of her son. Such were the proceedings in the Senate. It was the 
<A NAME="205"></A>same with the emperor. Vescularius Atticus and Julius Marinus were hurried 
<A NAME="206"></A>off to execution, two of his oldest friends, men who had followed him to 
<A NAME="207"></A>Rhodes and been his inseparable companions at Capreae. Vescularius was 
<A NAME="208"></A>his agent in the plot against Libo, and it was with the co-operation of 
<A NAME="209"></A>Marinus that Sejanus had ruined Curtius Atticus. Hence there was all the 
<A NAME="210"></A>more joy at the recoil of these precedents on their 
<A NAME="211"></A>authors.
<A NAME="212"></A><BR><BR>About the same time Lucius Piso, the pontiff, died a natural death, 
<A NAME="213"></A>a rare incident in so high a rank. Never had he by choice proposed a servile 
<A NAME="214"></A>motion, and, whenever necessity was too strong for him, he would suggest 
<A NAME="215"></A>judicious compromises. His father, as I have related, had been a censor. 
<A NAME="216"></A>He lived to the advanced age of eighty, and had won in Thrace the honour 
<A NAME="217"></A>of a triumph. But his chief glory rested on the wonderful tact with which 
<A NAME="218"></A>as city-prefect he handled an authority, recently made perpetual and all 
<A NAME="219"></A>the more galling to men unaccustomed to obey it.
<A NAME="220"></A><BR><BR>In former days, when the kings and subsequently the chief magistrates 
<A NAME="221"></A>went from Rome, an official was temporarily chosen to administer justice 
<A NAME="222"></A>and provide for emergencies, so that the capital might not be left without 
<A NAME="223"></A>government. It is said that Denter Romulius was appointed by Romulus, then 
<A NAME="224"></A>Numa Marcius by Tullus Hostilius, and Spurius Lucretius by Tarquinius Superbus. 
<A NAME="225"></A>Afterwards, the consuls made the appointment. The shadow of the old practice 
<A NAME="226"></A>still survives, whenever in consequence of the Latin festival some one 
<A NAME="227"></A>is deputed to exercise the consul's functions. And Augustus too during 
<A NAME="228"></A>the civil wars gave Cilnius Maecenas, a Roman knight, charge of everything 
<A NAME="229"></A>in Rome and Italy. When he rose to supreme power, in consideration of the 
<A NAME="230"></A>magnitude of the State and the slowness of legal remedies, he selected 
<A NAME="231"></A>one of the exconsuls to overawe the slaves and that part of the population 
<A NAME="232"></A>which, unless it fears a strong hand, is disorderly and reckless. Messala 
<A NAME="233"></A>Corvinus was the first to obtain the office, which he lost within a few 
<A NAME="234"></A>days, as not knowing how to discharge it. After him Taurus Statilius, though 
<A NAME="235"></A>in advanced years, sustained it admirably; and then Piso, after twenty 
<A NAME="236"></A>years of similar credit, was, by the Senate's decree, honoured with a public 
<A NAME="237"></A>funeral.
<A NAME="238"></A><BR><BR>A motion was next brought forward in the Senate by Quintilianus, 
<A NAME="239"></A>a tribune of the people, respecting an alleged book of the Sibyl. Caninius 
<A NAME="240"></A>Gallus, a book of the College of the Fifteen, had asked that it might be 
<A NAME="241"></A>received among the other volumes of the same prophetess by a decree on 
<A NAME="242"></A>the subject. This having been carried by a division, the emperor sent a 
<A NAME="243"></A>letter in which he gently censured the tribune, as ignorant of ancient 
<A NAME="244"></A>usage because of his youth. Gallus he scolded for having introduced the 
<A NAME="245"></A>matter in a thin Senate, notwithstanding his long experience in the science 
<A NAME="246"></A>of religious ceremonies, without taking the opinion of the College or having 
<A NAME="247"></A>the verses read and criticised, as was usual, by its presidents, though 
<A NAME="248"></A>their authenticity was very doubtful. He also reminded him that, as many 
<A NAME="249"></A>spurious productions were current under a celebrated name, Augustus had 
<A NAME="250"></A>prescribed a day within which they should be deposited with the city-praetor, 
<A NAME="251"></A>and after which it should not be lawful for any private person to hold 
<A NAME="252"></A>them. The same regulations too had been made by our ancestors after the 
<A NAME="253"></A>burning of the Capitol in the social war, when there was a search throughout 
<A NAME="254"></A>Samos, Ilium, Erythrae, and even in Africa, Sicily and the Italian colonies 
<A NAME="255"></A>for the verses of the Sibyl (whether there were but one or more) and the 
<A NAME="256"></A>priests were charged with the business of distinguishing, as far as they 
<A NAME="257"></A>could by human means, what were genuine. Accordingly the book in question 
<A NAME="258"></A>was now also submitted to the scrutiny of the College of the 
<A NAME="259"></A>Fifteen.
<A NAME="260"></A><BR><BR>During the same consulship a high price of corn almost brought 
<A NAME="261"></A>on an insurrection. For several days there were many clamorous demands 
<A NAME="262"></A>made in the theatre with an unusual freedom of language towards the emperor. 
<A NAME="263"></A>This provoked him to censure the magistrates and the Senate for not having 
<A NAME="264"></A>used the authority of the State to put down the people. He named too the 
<A NAME="265"></A>corn-supplying provinces, and dwelt on the far larger amount of grain imported 
<A NAME="266"></A>by himself than by Augustus. So the Senate drew up a decree in the severe 
<A NAME="267"></A>spirit of antiquity, and the consuls issued a not less stringent proclamation. 
<A NAME="268"></A>The emperor's silence was not, as he had hoped, taken as a proof of patriotism, 
<A NAME="269"></A>but of pride.
<A NAME="270"></A><BR><BR>At the year's close Geminius, Celsus and Pompeius, Roman knights, 
<A NAME="271"></A>fell beneath a charge of conspiracy. Of these Caius Geminius, by lavish 
<A NAME="272"></A>expenditure and a luxurious life, had been a friend of Sejanus, but with 
<A NAME="273"></A>no serious result. Julius Celsus, a tribune, while in confinement, loosened 
<A NAME="274"></A>his chain, and having twisted it around him, broke his neck by throwing 
<A NAME="275"></A>himself in an opposite direction. Rubrius Fabatus was put under surveillance, 
<A NAME="276"></A>on a suspicion that, in despair of the fortunes of Rome, he meant to throw 
<A NAME="277"></A>himself on the mercy of the Parthians. He was, at any rate, found near 
<A NAME="278"></A>the Straits of the Sicily, and, when dragged back by a centurion, he assigned 
<A NAME="279"></A>no adequate reason for his long journey. Still, he lived on in safety, 
<A NAME="280"></A>thanks to forgetfulness rather than to mercy.
<A NAME="281"></A><BR><BR>In the consulship of Servius Galba and Lucius Sulla, the emperor, 
<A NAME="282"></A>after having long considered whom he was to choose to be husbands for his 
<A NAME="283"></A>granddaughters, now that the maidens were of marriageable age, selected 
<A NAME="284"></A>Lucius Cassius and Marcus Vinicius. Vinicius was of provincial descent; 
<A NAME="285"></A>he was born at Cales, his father and grandfather having been consuls, and 
<A NAME="286"></A>his family, on the other side, being of the rank of knights. He was a man 
<A NAME="287"></A>of amiable temper and of cultivated eloquence. Cassius was of an ancient 
<A NAME="288"></A>and honourable, though plebeian house, at Rome. Though he was brought up 
<A NAME="289"></A>by his father under a severe training, he won esteem more frequently by 
<A NAME="290"></A>his good-nature than by his diligence. To him and to Vinicius the emperor 
<A NAME="291"></A>married respectively Drusilla and Julia, Germanicus's daughters, and addressed 
<A NAME="292"></A>a letter on the subject to the Senate, with a slightly complimentary mention 
<A NAME="293"></A>of the young men. He next assigned some very vague reasons for his absence, 
<A NAME="294"></A>then passed to more important matters, the ill-will against him originating 
<A NAME="295"></A>in his state policy, and requested that Macro, who commanded the praetorians, 
<A NAME="296"></A>with a few tribunes and centurions, might accompany him whenever he entered 
<A NAME="297"></A>the Senate-house. But though a decree was voted by the Senate on a liberal 
<A NAME="298"></A>scale and without any restrictions as to rank or numbers, he never so much 
<A NAME="299"></A>as went near the walls of Rome, much less the State-council, for he would 
<A NAME="300"></A>often go round and avoid his native city by circuitous 
<A NAME="301"></A>routes.
<A NAME="302"></A><BR><BR>Meanwhile a powerful host of accusers fell with sudden fury on 
<A NAME="303"></A>the class which systematically increased its wealth by usury in defiance 
<A NAME="304"></A>of a law passed by Caesar the Dictator defining the terms of lending money 
<A NAME="305"></A>and of holding estates in Italy, a law long obsolete because the public 
<A NAME="306"></A>good is sacrificed to private interest. The curse of usury was indeed of 
<A NAME="307"></A>old standing in Rome and a most frequent cause of sedition and discord, 
<A NAME="308"></A>and it was therefore repressed even in the early days of a less corrupt 
<A NAME="309"></A>morality. First, the Twelve Tables prohibited any one from exacting more 
<A NAME="310"></A>than 10 per cent., when, previously, the rate had depended on the caprice 
<A NAME="311"></A>of the wealthy. Subsequently, by a bill brought in by the tribunes, interest 
<A NAME="312"></A>was reduced to half that amount, and finally compound interest was wholly 
<A NAME="313"></A>forbidden. A check too was put by several enactments of the people on evasions 
<A NAME="314"></A>which, though continually put down, still, through strange artifices, reappeared. 
<A NAME="315"></A>On this occasion, however, Gracchus, the praetor, to whose jurisdiction 
<A NAME="316"></A>the inquiry had fallen, felt himself compelled by the number of persons 
<A NAME="317"></A>endangered to refer the matter to the Senate. In their dismay the senators, 
<A NAME="318"></A>not one of whom was free from similar guilt, threw themselves on the emperor's 
<A NAME="319"></A>indulgence. He yielded, and a year and six months were granted, within 
<A NAME="320"></A>which every one was to settle his private accounts conformably to the requirements 
<A NAME="321"></A>of the law.
<A NAME="322"></A><BR><BR>Hence followed a scarcity of money, a great shock being given to 
<A NAME="323"></A>all credit, the current coin too, in consequence of the conviction of so 
<A NAME="324"></A>many persons and the sale of their property, being locked up in the imperial 
<A NAME="325"></A>treasury or the public exchequer. To meet this, the Senate had directed 
<A NAME="326"></A>that every creditor should have two-thirds his capital secured on estates 
<A NAME="327"></A>in Italy. Creditors however were suing for payment in full, and it was 
<A NAME="328"></A>not respectable for persons when sued to break faith. So, at first, there 
<A NAME="329"></A>were clamorous meetings and importunate entreaties; then noisy applications 
<A NAME="330"></A>to the praetor's court. And the very device intended as a remedy, the sale 
<A NAME="331"></A>and purchase of estates, proved the contrary, as the usurers had hoarded 
<A NAME="332"></A>up all their money for buying land. The facilities for selling were followed 
<A NAME="333"></A>by a fall of prices, and the deeper a man was in debt, the more reluctantly 
<A NAME="334"></A>did he part with his property, and many were utterly ruined. The destruction 
<A NAME="335"></A>of private wealth precipitated the fall of rank and reputation, till at 
<A NAME="336"></A>last the emperor interposed his aid by distributing throughout the banks 
<A NAME="337"></A>a hundred million sesterces, and allowing freedom to borrow without interest 
<A NAME="338"></A>for three years, provided the borrower gave security to the State in land 
<A NAME="339"></A>to double the amount. Credit was thus restored, and gradually private lenders 
<A NAME="340"></A>were found. The purchase too of estates was not carried out according to 
<A NAME="341"></A>the letter of the Senate's decree, rigour at the outset, as usual with 
<A NAME="342"></A>such matters, becoming negligence in the end.
<A NAME="343"></A><BR><BR>Former alarms then returned, as there was a charge of treason against 
<A NAME="344"></A>Considius Proculus. While he was celebrating his birthday without a fear, 
<A NAME="345"></A>he was hurried before the Senate, condemned and instantly put to death. 
<A NAME="346"></A>His sister Sancia was outlawed, on the accusation of Quintus Pomponius, 
<A NAME="347"></A>a restless spirit, who pretended that he employed himself in this and like 
<A NAME="348"></A>practices to win favour with the sovereign, and thereby alleviate the perils 
<A NAME="349"></A>hanging over his brother Pomponius Secundus.
<A NAME="350"></A><BR><BR>Pompeia Macrina too was sentenced to banishment. Her husband Argolicus 
<A NAME="351"></A>and her father-in-law Laco, leading men of Achaia, had been ruined by the 
<A NAME="352"></A>emperor. Her father likewise, an illustrious Roman knight, and her brother, 
<A NAME="353"></A>an ex-praetor, seeing their doom was near, destroyed themselves. It was 
<A NAME="354"></A>imputed to them as a crime that their great-grandfather Theophanes of Mitylene 
<A NAME="355"></A>had been one of the intimate friends of Pompey the Great, and that after 
<A NAME="356"></A>his death Greek flattery had paid him divine honours.
<A NAME="357"></A><BR><BR>Sextus Marius, the richest man in Spain, was next accused of incest 
<A NAME="358"></A>with his daughter, and thrown headlong from the Tarpeian rock. To remove 
<A NAME="359"></A>any doubt that the vastness of his wealth had proved the man's ruin, Tiberius 
<A NAME="360"></A>kept his gold-mines for himself, though they were forfeited to the State. 
<A NAME="361"></A>Executions were now a stimulus to his fury, and he ordered the death of 
<A NAME="362"></A>all who were lying in prison under accusation of complicity with Sejanus. 
<A NAME="363"></A>There lay, singly or in heaps, the unnumbered dead, of every age and sex, 
<A NAME="364"></A>the illustrious with the obscure. Kinsfolk and friends were not allowed 
<A NAME="365"></A>to be near them, to weep over them, or even to gaze on them too long. Spies 
<A NAME="366"></A>were set round them, who noted the sorrow of each mourner and followed 
<A NAME="367"></A>the rotting corpses, till they were dragged to the Tiber, where, floating 
<A NAME="368"></A>or driven on the bank, no one dared to burn or to touch them. The force 
<A NAME="369"></A>of terror had utterly extinguished the sense of human fellowship, and, 
<A NAME="370"></A>with the growth of cruelty, pity was thrust aside.
<A NAME="371"></A><BR><BR>About this time Caius Caesar, who became his grandfather's companion 
<A NAME="372"></A>on his retirement to Capreae, married Claudia, daughter of Marcus Silanus. 
<A NAME="373"></A>He was a man who masked a savage temper under an artful guise of self-restraint, 
<A NAME="374"></A>and neither his mother's doom nor the banishment of his brothers extorted 
<A NAME="375"></A>from him a single utterance. Whatever the humour of the day with Tiberius, 
<A NAME="376"></A>he would assume the like, and his language differed as little. Hence the 
<A NAME="377"></A>fame of a clever remark from the orator Passienus, that "there never was 
<A NAME="378"></A>a better slave or a worse master."
<A NAME="379"></A><BR><BR>I must not pass over a prognostication of Tiberius respecting Servius 
<A NAME="380"></A>Galba, then consul. Having sent for him and sounded him on various topics, 
<A NAME="381"></A>he at last addressed him in Greek to this effect: "You too, Galba, will 
<A NAME="382"></A>some day have a taste of empire." He thus hinted at a brief span of power 
<A NAME="383"></A>late in life, on the strength of his acquaintance with the art of astrologers, 
<A NAME="384"></A>leisure for acquiring which he had had at Rhodes, with Thrasyllus for instructor. 
<A NAME="385"></A>This man's skill he tested in the following manner.
<A NAME="386"></A><BR><BR>Whenever he sought counsel on such matters, he would make use of 
<A NAME="387"></A>the top of the house and of the confidence of one freedman, quite illiterate 
<A NAME="388"></A>and of great physical strength. The man always walked in front of the person 
<A NAME="389"></A>whose science Tiberius had determined to test, through an unfrequented 
<A NAME="390"></A>and precipitous path (for the house stood on rocks), and then, if any suspicion 
<A NAME="391"></A>had arisen of imposture or of trickery, he hurled the astrologer, as he 
<A NAME="392"></A>returned, into the sea beneath, that no one might live to betray the secret. 
<A NAME="393"></A>Thrasyllus accordingly was led up the same cliffs, and when he had deeply 
<A NAME="394"></A>impressed his questioner by cleverly revealing his imperial destiny and 
<A NAME="395"></A>future career, he was asked whether he had also thoroughly ascertained 
<A NAME="396"></A>his own horoscope, and the character of that particular year and day. After 
<A NAME="397"></A>surveying the positions and relative distances of the stars, he first paused, 
<A NAME="398"></A>then trembled, and the longer he gazed, the more was he agitated by amazement 
<A NAME="399"></A>and terror, till at last he exclaimed that a perilous and well-nigh fatal 
<A NAME="400"></A>crisis impended over him. Tiberius then embraced him and congratulated 
<A NAME="401"></A>him on foreseeing his dangers and on being quite safe. Taking what he had 
<A NAME="402"></A>said as an oracle, he retained him in the number of his intimate 
<A NAME="403"></A>friends.
<A NAME="404"></A><BR><BR>When I hear of these and like occurrences, I suspend my judgment 
<A NAME="405"></A>on the question whether it is fate and unchangeable necessity or chance 
<A NAME="406"></A>which governs the revolutions of human affairs. Indeed, among the wisest 
<A NAME="407"></A>of the ancients and among their disciples you will find conflicting theories, 
<A NAME="408"></A>many holding the conviction that heaven does not concern itself with the 
<A NAME="409"></A>beginning or the end of our life, or, in short, with mankind at all; and 
<A NAME="410"></A>that therefore sorrows are continually the lot of the good, happiness of 
<A NAME="411"></A>the wicked; while others, on the contrary, believe that though there is 
<A NAME="412"></A>a harmony between fate and events, yet it is not dependent on wandering 
<A NAME="413"></A>stars, but on primary elements, and on a combination of natural causes. 
<A NAME="414"></A>Still, they leave us the capacity of choosing our life, maintaining that, 
<A NAME="415"></A>the choice once made, there is a fixed sequence of events. Good and evil, 
<A NAME="416"></A>again, are not what vulgar opinion accounts them; many who seem to be struggling 
<A NAME="417"></A>with adversity are happy; many, amid great affluence, are utterly miserable, 
<A NAME="418"></A>if only the first bear their hard lot with patience, and the latter make 
<A NAME="419"></A>a foolish use of their prosperity.
<A NAME="420"></A><BR><BR>Most men, however, cannot part with the belief that each person's 
<A NAME="421"></A>future is fixed from his very birth, but that some things happen differently 
<A NAME="422"></A>from what has been foretold through the impostures of those who describe 
<A NAME="423"></A>what they do not know, and that this destroys the credit of a science, 
<A NAME="424"></A>clear testimonies to which have been given both by past ages and by our 
<A NAME="425"></A>own. In fact, how the son of this same Thrasyllus predicted Nero's reign 
<A NAME="426"></A>I shall relate when the time comes, not to digress too far from my 
<A NAME="427"></A>subject.
<A NAME="428"></A><BR><BR>That same year the death of Asinius Gallus became known. That he 
<A NAME="429"></A>died of starvation, there was not a doubt; whether of his own choice or 
<A NAME="430"></A>by compulsion, was a question. The emperor was asked whether he would allow 
<A NAME="431"></A>him to be buried, and he blushed not to grant the favour, and actually 
<A NAME="432"></A>blamed the accident which had proved fatal to the accused before he could 
<A NAME="433"></A>be convicted in his presence. Just as if in a three years' interval an 
<A NAME="434"></A>opportunity was wanting for the trial of an old ex-consul and the father 
<A NAME="435"></A>of a number of ex-consuls.
<A NAME="436"></A><BR><BR>Next Drusus perished, after having prolonged life for eight days 
<A NAME="437"></A>on the most wretched of food, even chewing the stuffing, his bed. According 
<A NAME="438"></A>to some writers, Macro had been instructed that, in case of Sejanus attempting 
<A NAME="439"></A>an armed revolt, he was to hurry the young prince out of the confinement 
<A NAME="440"></A>in which he was detained in the Palace and put him at the head of the people. 
<A NAME="441"></A>Subsequently the emperor, as a rumour was gaining ground that he was on 
<A NAME="442"></A>the point of a reconciliation with his daughter-in-law and his grandson, 
<A NAME="443"></A>chose to be merciless rather than to relent.
<A NAME="444"></A><BR><BR>He even bitterly reviled him after his death, taunting him with 
<A NAME="445"></A>nameless abominations and with a spirit bent on his family's ruin and hostile 
<A NAME="446"></A>to the State. And, what seemed most horrible of all, he ordered a daily 
<A NAME="447"></A>journal of all that he said and did to be read in public. That there had 
<A NAME="448"></A>been spies by his side for so many years, to note his looks, his sighs, 
<A NAME="449"></A>and even his whispered thoughts, and that his grandfather could have heard 
<A NAME="450"></A>read, and published all, was scarce credible. But letters of Attius, a 
<A NAME="451"></A>centurion, and Didymus, a freedman, openly exhibited the names of slave 
<A NAME="452"></A>after slave who had respectively struck or scared Drusus as he was quitting 
<A NAME="453"></A>his chamber. The centurion had actually added, as something highly meritorious, 
<A NAME="454"></A>his own language in all its brutality, and some utterances of the dying 
<A NAME="455"></A>man in which, at first feigning loss of reason, he imprecated in seeming 
<A NAME="456"></A>madness fearful things on Tiberius, and then, when hope of life was gone, 
<A NAME="457"></A>denounced him with a studied and elaborate curse. "As he had slain a daughter-in-law, 
<A NAME="458"></A>a brother's son, and son's sons, and filled his whole house with bloodshed, 
<A NAME="459"></A>so might he pay the full penalty due to the name and race of his ancestors 
<A NAME="460"></A>as well as to future generations."
<A NAME="461"></A><BR><BR>The Senate clamorously interrupted, with an affectation of horror, 
<A NAME="462"></A>but they were penetrated by alarm and amazement at seeing that a hitherto 
<A NAME="463"></A>cunning prince, who had shrouded his wickedness in mystery, had waxed so 
<A NAME="464"></A>bold as to remove, so to speak, the walls of his house and display his 
<A NAME="465"></A>grandson under a centurion's lash, amid the buffetings of slaves, craving 
<A NAME="466"></A>in vain the last sustenance of life.
<A NAME="467"></A><BR><BR>Men's grief at all this had not died away when news was heard of 
<A NAME="468"></A>Agrippina. She had lived on, sustained by hope, I suppose, after the destruction 
<A NAME="469"></A>of Sejanus, and, when she found no abatement of horrors, had voluntarily 
<A NAME="470"></A>perished, though possibly nourishment was refused her and a fiction concocted 
<A NAME="471"></A>of a death that might seem self-chosen. Tiberius, it is certain, vented 
<A NAME="472"></A>his wrath in the foulest charges. He reproached her with unchastity, with 
<A NAME="473"></A>having had Asinius Gallus as a paramour and being driven by his death to 
<A NAME="474"></A>loathe existence. But Agrippina, who could not endure equality and loved 
<A NAME="475"></A>to domineer, was with her masculine aspirations far removed from the frailties 
<A NAME="476"></A>of women. The emperor further observed that she died on the same day on 
<A NAME="477"></A>which Sejanus had paid the penalty of his crime two years before, a fact, 
<A NAME="478"></A>he said, to be recorded; and he made it a boast that she had not been strangled 
<A NAME="479"></A>by the halter and flung down the Gemonian steps. He received a vote of 
<A NAME="480"></A>thanks, and it was decreed that on the seventeenth of October, the day 
<A NAME="481"></A>on which both perished, through all future years, an offering should be 
<A NAME="482"></A>consecrated to Jupiter.
<A NAME="483"></A><BR><BR>Soon afterwards Cocceius Nerva, a man always at the emperor's side, 
<A NAME="484"></A>a master of law both divine and human, whose position was secure and health 
<A NAME="485"></A>sound, resolved to die. Tiberius, as soon as he knew it, sat by him and 
<A NAME="486"></A>asked his reasons, adding intreaties, and finally protesting that it would 
<A NAME="487"></A>be a burden on his conscience and a blot on his reputation, if the most 
<A NAME="488"></A>intimate of his friends were to fly from life without any cause for death. 
<A NAME="489"></A>Nerva turned away from his expostulations and persisted in his abstinence 
<A NAME="490"></A>from all food. Those who knew his thoughts said that as he saw more closely 
<A NAME="491"></A>into the miseries of the State, he chose, in anger and alarm, an honourable 
<A NAME="492"></A>death, while he was yet safe and unassailed on.
<A NAME="493"></A><BR><BR>Meanwhile Agrippina's ruin, strange to say, dragged Plancina with 
<A NAME="494"></A>it. Formerly the wife of Cneius Piso, and one who had openly exulted at 
<A NAME="495"></A>the death of Germanicus, she had been saved, when Piso fell, by the intreaties 
<A NAME="496"></A>of Augusta, and not less by the enmity of Agrippina. When hatred and favour 
<A NAME="497"></A>had alike passed away, justice asserted itself. Pursued by charges universally 
<A NAME="498"></A>notorious, she suffered by her own hand a penalty tardy rather than 
<A NAME="499"></A>undeserved.
<A NAME="500"></A><BR><BR>Amid the many sorrows which saddened Rome, one cause of grief was 
<A NAME="501"></A>the marriage of Julia, Drusus's daughter and Nero's late wife, into the 
<A NAME="502"></A>humbler family of Rubellius Blandus, whose grandfather many remembered 
<A NAME="503"></A>as a Roman knight from Tibur. At the end of the year the death of Aelius 
<A NAME="504"></A>Lamia, who, after being at last released from the farce of governing Syria, 
<A NAME="505"></A>had become city-prefect, was celebrated with the honours of a censor's 
<A NAME="506"></A>funeral. He was a man of illustrious descent, and in a hale old age; and 
<A NAME="507"></A>the fact of the province having been withheld gained him additional esteem. 
<A NAME="508"></A>Subsequently, on the death of Flaccus Pomponius, propraetor of Syria, a 
<A NAME="509"></A>letter from the emperor was read, in which he complained that all the best 
<A NAME="510"></A>men who were fit to command armies declined the service, and that he was 
<A NAME="511"></A>thus necessarily driven to intreaties, by which some of the ex-consuls 
<A NAME="512"></A>might be prevailed on to take provinces. He forgot that Arruntius had been 
<A NAME="513"></A>kept at home now for ten years, that he might not go to 
<A NAME="514"></A>Spain.
<A NAME="515"></A><BR><BR>That same year Marcus Lepidus also died. I have dwelt at sufficient 
<A NAME="516"></A>length on his moderation and wisdom in my earlier books, and I need not 
<A NAME="517"></A>further enlarge on his noble descent. Assuredly the family of the Aemilii 
<A NAME="518"></A>has been rich in good citizens, and even the members of that house whose 
<A NAME="519"></A>morals were corrupt, still lived with a certain splendour.
<A NAME="520"></A><BR><BR>During the consulship of Paulus Fabius and Lucius Vitellius, the 
<A NAME="521"></A>bird called the phoenix, after a long succession of ages, appeared in Egypt 
<A NAME="522"></A>and furnished the most learned men of that country and of Greece with abundant 
<A NAME="523"></A>matter for the discussion of the marvellous phenomenon. It is my wish to 
<A NAME="524"></A>make known all on which they agree with several things, questionable enough 
<A NAME="525"></A>indeed, but not too absurd to be noticed.
<A NAME="526"></A><BR><BR>That it is a creature sacred to the sun, differing from all other 
<A NAME="527"></A>birds in its beak and in the tints of its plumage, is held unanimously 
<A NAME="528"></A>by those who have described its nature. As to the number of years it lives, 
<A NAME="529"></A>there are various accounts. The general tradition says five hundred years. 
<A NAME="530"></A>Some maintain that it is seen at intervals of fourteen hundred and sixty-one 
<A NAME="531"></A>years, and that the former birds flew into the city called Heliopolis successively 
<A NAME="532"></A>in the reigns of Sesostris, Amasis, and Ptolemy, the third king of the 
<A NAME="533"></A>Macedonian dynasty, with a multitude of companion birds marvelling at the 
<A NAME="534"></A>novelty of the appearance. But all antiquity is of course obscure. From 
<A NAME="535"></A>Ptolemy to Tiberius was a period of less than five hundred years. Consequently 
<A NAME="536"></A>some have supposed that this was a spurious phoenix, not from the regions 
<A NAME="537"></A>of Arabia, and with none of the instincts which ancient tradition has attributed 
<A NAME="538"></A>to the bird. For when the number of years is completed and death is near, 
<A NAME="539"></A>the phoenix, it is said, builds a nest in the land of its birth and infuses 
<A NAME="540"></A>into it a germ of life from which an offspring arises, whose first care, 
<A NAME="541"></A>when fledged, is to bury its father. This is not rashly done, but taking 
<A NAME="542"></A>up a load of myrrh and having tried its strength by a long flight, as soon 
<A NAME="543"></A>as it is equal to the burden and to the journey, it carries its father's 
<A NAME="544"></A>body, bears it to the altar of the Sun, and leaves it to the flames. All 
<A NAME="545"></A>this is full of doubt and legendary exaggeration. Still, there is no question 
<A NAME="546"></A>that the bird is occasionally seen in Egypt.
<A NAME="547"></A><BR><BR>Rome meanwhile being a scene of ceaseless bloodshed, Pomponius 
<A NAME="548"></A>Labeo, who was, as I have related, governor of Moesia, severed his veins 
<A NAME="549"></A>and let his life ebb from him. His wife, Paxaea, emulated her husband. 
<A NAME="550"></A>What made such deaths eagerly sought was dread of the executioner, and 
<A NAME="551"></A>the fact too that the condemned, besides forfeiture of their property, 
<A NAME="552"></A>were deprived of burial, while those who decided their fate themselves, 
<A NAME="553"></A>had their bodies interred, and their wills remained valid, a recompense 
<A NAME="554"></A>this for their despatch. The emperor, however, argued in a letter to the 
<A NAME="555"></A>Senate that it had been the practice of our ancestors, whenever they broke 
<A NAME="556"></A>off an intimacy, to forbid the person their house, and so put an end to 
<A NAME="557"></A>friendship. "This usage he had himself revived in Labeo's case, but Labeo, 
<A NAME="558"></A>being pressed by charges of maladministration in his province and other 
<A NAME="559"></A>crimes, had screened his guilt by bringing odium on another, and had groundlessly 
<A NAME="560"></A>alarmed his wife, who, though criminal, was still free from 
<A NAME="561"></A>danger."
<A NAME="562"></A><BR><BR>Mamercus Scaurus was then for the second time impeached, a man 
<A NAME="563"></A>of distinguished rank and ability as an advocate, but of infamous life. 
<A NAME="564"></A>He fell, not through the friendship of Sejanus, but through what was no 
<A NAME="565"></A>less powerful to destroy, the enmity of Macro, who practised the same arts 
<A NAME="566"></A>more secretly. Macro's information was grounded on the subject of a tragedy 
<A NAME="567"></A>written by Scaurus, from which he cited some verses which might be twisted 
<A NAME="568"></A>into allusions to Tiberius. But Servilius and Cornelius, his accusers, 
<A NAME="569"></A>alleged adultery with Livia and the practice of magical rites. Scaurus, 
<A NAME="570"></A>as befitted the old house of the Aemilii, forestalled the fatal sentence 
<A NAME="571"></A>at the persuasion of his wife Sextia, who urged him to die and shared his 
<A NAME="572"></A>death.
<A NAME="573"></A><BR><BR>Still the informers were punished when ever an opportunity occurred. 
<A NAME="574"></A>Servilius and Cornelius, for example, whom the destruction of Scaurus had 
<A NAME="575"></A>made notorious, were outlawed and transported to some islands for having 
<A NAME="576"></A>taken money from Varius Ligur for dropping a prosecution. Abudius Ruso 
<A NAME="577"></A>too, who had been an aedile, in seeking to imperil Lentulus Gaetulicus, 
<A NAME="578"></A>under whom he had commanded a legion, by alleging that he had fixed on 
<A NAME="579"></A>a son of Sejanus for his son-in-law, was himself actually condemned and 
<A NAME="580"></A>banished from Rome. Gaetulicus at this time was in charge of the legions 
<A NAME="581"></A>of Upper Germany, and had won from them singular affection, as a man of 
<A NAME="582"></A>unbounded kindliness, moderate in his strictness, and popular even with 
<A NAME="583"></A>the neighbouring army through his father-in-law, Lucius Apronius. Hence 
<A NAME="584"></A>rumour persistently affirmed that he had ventured to send the emperor a 
<A NAME="585"></A>letter, reminding him that his alliance with Sejanus had not originated 
<A NAME="586"></A>in his own choice, but in the advice of Tiberius; that he was himself as 
<A NAME="587"></A>liable to be deceived as Tiberius, and that the same mistake ought not 
<A NAME="588"></A>to be held innocent in the prince and be a source of ruin to others. His 
<A NAME="589"></A>loyalty was still untainted and would so remain, if he was not assaIled 
<A NAME="590"></A>by any plot. A successor he should accept as an announcement of his doom. 
<A NAME="591"></A>A compact, so to say, ought to be sealed between them, by which he should 
<A NAME="592"></A>retain his province, and the emperor be master of all else. Strange as 
<A NAME="593"></A>this story was, it derived credibility from the fact that Gaetulicus alone 
<A NAME="594"></A>of all connected with Sejanus lived in safety and in high favour, Tiberius 
<A NAME="595"></A>bearing in mind the people's hatred, his own extreme age how his government 
<A NAME="596"></A>rested more on prestige than on power.
<A NAME="597"></A><BR><BR>In the consulship of Caius Cestius and Marcus Servilius, some Parthian 
<A NAME="598"></A>nobles came to Rome without the knowledge of their king Artabanus. Dread 
<A NAME="599"></A>of Germanicus had made that prince faithful to the Romans and just to his 
<A NAME="600"></A>people, but he subsequently changed this behaviour for insolence towards 
<A NAME="601"></A>us and tyranny to his subjects. He was elated by the wars which he had 
<A NAME="602"></A>successfully waged against the surrounding nations, while he disdained 
<A NAME="603"></A>the aged and, as he thought, unwarlike Tiberius, eagerly coveting Armenia, 
<A NAME="604"></A>over which, on the death of Artaxias, he placed Arsaces, his eldest son. 
<A NAME="605"></A>He further added insult, and sent envoys to reclaim the treasures left 
<A NAME="606"></A>by Vonones in Syria and Cilicia. Then too he insisted on the ancient boundaries 
<A NAME="607"></A>of Persia and Macedonia, and intimated, with a vainglorious threat, that 
<A NAME="608"></A>he meant to seize on the country possessed by Cyrus and afterwards by 
<A NAME="609"></A>Alexander.
<A NAME="610"></A><BR><BR>The chief adviser of the Parthians in sending the secret embassy 
<A NAME="611"></A>was Sinnaces, a man of distinguished family and corresponding wealth. Next 
<A NAME="612"></A>in influence was Abdus, an eunuch, a class which, far from being despised 
<A NAME="613"></A>among barbarians, actually possesses power. These, with some other nobles 
<A NAME="614"></A>whom they admitted to their counsels, as there was not a single Arsacid 
<A NAME="615"></A>whom they could put on the throne, most of the family having been murdered 
<A NAME="616"></A>by Artabanus or being under age, demanded that Phraates, son of king Phraates, 
<A NAME="617"></A>should be sent from Rome. "Only a name," they said, "and an authority were 
<A NAME="618"></A>wanted; only, in fact, that, with Caesar's consent, a scion of the house 
<A NAME="619"></A>of Arsaces should show himself on the banks of the Euphrates."
<A NAME="620"></A><BR><BR>This suited the wishes of Tiberius. He provided Phraates with what 
<A NAME="621"></A>he needed for assuming his father's sovereignty, while he clung to his 
<A NAME="622"></A>purpose of regulating foreign affairs by a crafty policy and keeping war 
<A NAME="623"></A>at a distance. Artabanus meanwhile, hearing of the treacherous arrangement, 
<A NAME="624"></A>was one moment perplexed by apprehension, the next fired with a longing 
<A NAME="625"></A>for revenge. With barbarians, indecision is a slave's weakness; prompt 
<A NAME="626"></A>action king-like. But now expediency prevailed, and he invited Abdus, under 
<A NAME="627"></A>the guise of friendship, to a banquet, and disabled him by a lingering 
<A NAME="628"></A>poison; Sinnaces he put off by pretexts and presents, and also by various 
<A NAME="629"></A>employments. Phraates meanwhile, on arriving in Syria, where he threw off 
<A NAME="630"></A>the Roman fashions to which for so many years he had been accustomed, and 
<A NAME="631"></A>adapted himself to Parthian habits, unable to endure the customs of his 
<A NAME="632"></A>country, was carried off by an illness. Still, Tiberius did not relinquish 
<A NAME="633"></A>his purpose. He chose Tiridates, of the same stock as Artabanus, to be 
<A NAME="634"></A>his rival, and the Iberian Mithridates to be the instrument of recovering 
<A NAME="635"></A>Armenia, having reconciled him to his brother Pharasmanes, who held the 
<A NAME="636"></A>throne of that country. He then intrusted the whole of his eastern policy 
<A NAME="637"></A>to Lucius Vitellius. The man, I am aware, had a bad name at Rome, and many 
<A NAME="638"></A>a foul story was told of him. But in the government of provinces he acted 
<A NAME="639"></A>with the virtue of ancient times. He returned, and then, through fear of 
<A NAME="640"></A>Caius Caesar and intimacy with Claudius, he degenerated into a servility 
<A NAME="641"></A>so base that he is regarded by an after-generation as the type of the most 
<A NAME="642"></A>degrading adulation. The beginning of his career was forgotten in its end, 
<A NAME="643"></A>and an old age of infamy effaced the virtues of youth.
<A NAME="644"></A><BR><BR>Of the petty chiefs Mithridates was the first to persuade Pharasmanes 
<A NAME="645"></A>to aid his enterprise by stratagem and force, and agents of corruption 
<A NAME="646"></A>were found who tempted the servants of Arsaces into crime by a quantity 
<A NAME="647"></A>of gold. At the same instant the Iberians burst into Armenia with a huge 
<A NAME="648"></A>host, and captured the city of Artaxata. Artabanus, on hearing this, made 
<A NAME="649"></A>his son Orodes the instrument of vengeance. He gave him the Parthian army 
<A NAME="650"></A>and despatched men to hire auxiliaries. Pharasmanes, on the other hand, 
<A NAME="651"></A>allied himself with the Albanians, and procured aid from the Sarmatae, 
<A NAME="652"></A>whose highest chiefs took bribes from both sides, after the fashion of 
<A NAME="653"></A>their countrymen, and engaged themselves in conflicting interests. But 
<A NAME="654"></A>the Iberians, who were masters of the various positions, suddenly poured 
<A NAME="655"></A>the Sarmatae into Armenia by the Caspian route. Meanwhile those who were 
<A NAME="656"></A>coming up to the support of the Parthians were easily kept back, all other 
<A NAME="657"></A>approaches having been closed by the enemy except one, between the sea 
<A NAME="658"></A>and the mountains on the Albanian frontier, which summer rendered difficult, 
<A NAME="659"></A>as there the shallows are flooded by the force of the Etesian gales. The 
<A NAME="660"></A>south wind in winter rolls back the waves, and when the sea is driven back 
<A NAME="661"></A>upon itself, the shallows along the coast, are exposed.
<A NAME="662"></A><BR><BR>Meantime, while Orodes was without an ally, Pharasmanes, now strengthened 
<A NAME="663"></A>by reinforcements, challenged him to battle, taunted him on his refusal, 
<A NAME="664"></A>rode up to his camp and harassed his foraging parties. He often hemmed 
<A NAME="665"></A>him in with his picquets in the fashion of a blockade, till the Parthians, 
<A NAME="666"></A>who were unused to such insults, gathered round the king and demanded battle. 
<A NAME="667"></A>Their sole strength was in cavalry; Pharasmanes was also powerful in infantry, 
<A NAME="668"></A>for the Iberians and Albanians, inhabiting as they did a densely wooded 
<A NAME="669"></A>country, were more inured to hardship and endurance. They claim to have 
<A NAME="670"></A>been descended from the Thessalians, at the period when Jason, after the 
<A NAME="671"></A>departure of Medea and the children born of her, returned subsequently 
<A NAME="672"></A>to the empty palace of Aeetes, and the vacant kingdom of Colchi. They have 
<A NAME="673"></A>many traditions connected with his name and with the oracle of Phrixus. 
<A NAME="674"></A>No one among them would think of sacrificing a ram, the animal supposed 
<A NAME="675"></A>to have conveyed Phrixus, whether it was really a ram or the figure-head 
<A NAME="676"></A>of a ship.
<A NAME="677"></A><BR><BR>Both sides having been drawn up in battle array, the Parthian leader 
<A NAME="678"></A>expatiated on the empire of the East, and the renown of the Arsacids, in 
<A NAME="679"></A>contrast to the despicable Iberian chief with his hireling soldiery. Pharasmanes 
<A NAME="680"></A>reminded his people that they had been free from Parthian domination, and 
<A NAME="681"></A>that the grander their aims, the more glory they would win if victorious, 
<A NAME="682"></A>the more disgrace and peril they would incur if they turned their backs. 
<A NAME="683"></A>He pointed, as he spoke, to his own menacing array, and to the Median bands 
<A NAME="684"></A>with their golden embroidery; warriors, as he said, on one side, spoil 
<A NAME="685"></A>on the other.
<A NAME="686"></A><BR><BR>Among the Sarmatae the general's voice was not alone to be heard. 
<A NAME="687"></A>They encouraged one another not to begin the battle with volleys of arrows; 
<A NAME="688"></A>they must, they said, anticipate attack by a hand to hand charge. Then 
<A NAME="689"></A>followed every variety of conflict. The Parthians, accustomed to pursue 
<A NAME="690"></A>or fly with equal science, deployed their squadrons, and sought scope for 
<A NAME="691"></A>their missiles. The Sarmatae, throwing aside their bows, which at a shorter 
<A NAME="692"></A>range are effective, rushed on with pikes and swords. Sometimes, as in 
<A NAME="693"></A>a cavalry-action, there would be alternate advances and retreats, then, 
<A NAME="694"></A>again, close fighting, in which, breast to breast, with the clash of arms, 
<A NAME="695"></A>they repulsed the foe or were themselves repulsed. And now the Albanians 
<A NAME="696"></A>and Iberians seized, and hurled the Parthians from their steeds, and embarrassed 
<A NAME="697"></A>their enemy with a double attack, pressed as they were by the cavalry on 
<A NAME="698"></A>the heights and by the nearer blows of the infantry. Meanwhile Pharasmanes 
<A NAME="699"></A>and Orodes, who, as they cheered on the brave and supported the wavering, 
<A NAME="700"></A>were conspicuous to all, and so recognised each other, rushed to the combat 
<A NAME="701"></A>with a shout, with javelins, and galloping chargers, Pharasmanes with the 
<A NAME="702"></A>greater impetuosity, for he pierced his enemy's helmet at a stroke. But 
<A NAME="703"></A>he could not repeat the blow, as he was hurried onwards by his horse, and 
<A NAME="704"></A>the wounded man was protected by the bravest of his guards. A rumour that 
<A NAME="705"></A>he was slain, which was believed by mistake, struck panic into the Parthians, 
<A NAME="706"></A>and they yielded the victory.
<A NAME="707"></A><BR><BR>Artabanus very soon marched with the whole strength of his kingdom, 
<A NAME="708"></A>intent on vengeance. The Iberians from their knowledge of the country fought 
<A NAME="709"></A>at an advantage. Still Artabanus did not retreat till Vitellius had assembled 
<A NAME="710"></A>his legions and, by starting a report that he meant to invade Mesopotamia, 
<A NAME="711"></A>raised an alarm of war with Rome. Armenia was then abandoned, and the fortunes 
<A NAME="712"></A>of Artabanus were overthrown, Vitellius persuading his subjects to forsake 
<A NAME="713"></A>a king who was a tyrant in peace, and ruinously unsuccessful in war. And 
<A NAME="714"></A>so Sinnaces, whose enmity to the prince I have already mentioned, drew 
<A NAME="715"></A>into actual revolt his father Abdageses and others, who had been secretly 
<A NAME="716"></A>in his counsel, and were now after their continued disasters more eager 
<A NAME="717"></A>to fight. By degrees, many flocked to him who, having been kept in subjection 
<A NAME="718"></A>by fear rather than by goodwill, took courage as soon as they found 
<A NAME="719"></A>leaders.
<A NAME="720"></A><BR><BR>Artabanus had now no resources but in some foreigners who guarded 
<A NAME="721"></A>his person, men exiled from their own homes, who had no perception of honour, 
<A NAME="722"></A>or any scruple about a base act, mere hireling instruments of crime. With 
<A NAME="723"></A>these attendants he hastened his flight into the remote country on the 
<A NAME="724"></A>borders of Scythia, in the hope of aid, as he was connected by marriage 
<A NAME="725"></A>alliances with the Hyrcanians and Carmanians. Meantime the Parthians, he 
<A NAME="726"></A>thought, indulgent as they are to an absent prince, though restless under 
<A NAME="727"></A>his presence, might turn to a better mind.
<A NAME="728"></A><BR><BR>Vitellius, as soon as Artabanus had fled and his people were inclined 
<A NAME="729"></A>to have a new king, urged Tiridates to seize the advantage thus offered, 
<A NAME="730"></A>and then led the main strength of the legions and the allies to the banks 
<A NAME="731"></A>of the Euphrates. While they were sacrificing, the one, after Roman custom, 
<A NAME="732"></A>offering a swine, a ram and a bull; the other, a horse which he had duly 
<A NAME="733"></A>prepared as a propitiation to the river-god, they were informed by the 
<A NAME="734"></A>neighbouring inhabitants that the Euphrates, without any violent rains, 
<A NAME="735"></A>was of itself rising to an immense height, and that the white foam was 
<A NAME="736"></A>curling into circles like a diadem, an omen of a prosperous passage. Some 
<A NAME="737"></A>explained it with more subtlety, of a successful commencement to the enterprise, 
<A NAME="738"></A>which, however, would not be lasting, on the ground, that though a confident 
<A NAME="739"></A>trust might be placed in prognostics given in the earth or in the heavens, 
<A NAME="740"></A>the fluctuating character of rivers exhibited omens which vanished the 
<A NAME="741"></A>same moment.
<A NAME="742"></A><BR><BR>A bridge of boats having been constructed and the army having crossed, 
<A NAME="743"></A>the first to enter the camp was Ornospades, with several thousand cavalry. 
<A NAME="744"></A>Formerly an exile, he had rendered conspicuous aid to Tiberius in the completion 
<A NAME="745"></A>of the Dalmatic war, and had for this been rewarded with Roman citizenship. 
<A NAME="746"></A>Subsequently, he had again sought the friendship of his king, by whom he 
<A NAME="747"></A>had been raised to high honour, and appointed governor of the plains, which, 
<A NAME="748"></A>being surrounded by the waters of those famous rivers, the Euphrates and 
<A NAME="749"></A>Tigris, have received the name of Mesopotamia. Soon afterwards, Sinnaces 
<A NAME="750"></A>reinforced the army, and Abdageses, the mainstay of the party, came with 
<A NAME="751"></A>the royal treasure and what belonged to the crown. Vitellius thought it 
<A NAME="752"></A>enough to have displayed the arms of Rome, and he then bade Tiridates remember 
<A NAME="753"></A>his grandfather Phraates, and his foster-father Caesar, and all that was 
<A NAME="754"></A>glorious in both of them, while the nobles were to show obedience to their 
<A NAME="755"></A>king, and respect for us, each maintaining his honour and his loyalty. 
<A NAME="756"></A>This done, he returned with the legions to Syria.
<A NAME="757"></A><BR><BR>I have related in sequence the events of two summer-campaigns, 
<A NAME="758"></A>as a relief to the reader's mind from our miseries at home. Though three 
<A NAME="759"></A>years had elapsed since the destruction of Sejanus, neither time, intreaties, 
<A NAME="760"></A>nor sated gratification, all which have a soothing effect on others, softened 
<A NAME="761"></A>Tiberius, or kept him from punishing doubtful or forgotten offenses as 
<A NAME="762"></A>most flagrant and recent crimes. Under this dread, Fulcinius Trio, unwilling 
<A NAME="763"></A>to face an onslaught of accusers, inserted in his will several terrible 
<A NAME="764"></A>imputations on Macro and on the emperor's principal freedmen, while he 
<A NAME="765"></A>taunted the emperor himself with the mental decay of old age, and the virtual 
<A NAME="766"></A>exile of continuous retirement. Tiberius ordered these insults, which Trio's 
<A NAME="767"></A>heirs had suppressed, to be publicly read, thus showing his tolerance of 
<A NAME="768"></A>free speech in others and despising his own shame, or, possibly, because 
<A NAME="769"></A>he had long been ignorant of the villanies of Sejanus, and now wished any 
<A NAME="770"></A>remarks, however reckless, to published, and so to ascertain, through invective, 
<A NAME="771"></A>if it must be so, the truth, which flattery obscures. About the same time 
<A NAME="772"></A>Granius Marcianus, a senator, who was accused of treason by Caius Gracchus, 
<A NAME="773"></A>laid hands on himself. Tarius Gratianus too, an ex-praetor, was condemned 
<A NAME="774"></A>under the same law to capital punishment.
<A NAME="775"></A><BR><BR>A similar fate befell Trebellienus Rufus and Sextius Paconianus. 
<A NAME="776"></A>Trebellienus perished by his own hand; Paconianus was strangled in prison 
<A NAME="777"></A>for having there written some lampoons on the emperor. Tiberius received 
<A NAME="778"></A>the news, no longer parted by the sea, as he had been once, or through 
<A NAME="779"></A>messengers from a distance, but in close proximity to Rome, so that on 
<A NAME="780"></A>the same day, or after the interval of a single night, he could reply to 
<A NAME="781"></A>the despatches of the consuls, and almost behold the bloodshed as it streamed 
<A NAME="782"></A>from house to house, and the strokes of the executioner.
<A NAME="783"></A><BR><BR>At the year's close Poppaeus Sabinus died, a man of somewhat humble 
<A NAME="784"></A>extraction, who had risen by his friendship with two emperors to the consulship 
<A NAME="785"></A>and the honours of a triumph. During twenty-four years he had the charge 
<A NAME="786"></A>of the most important provinces, not for any remarkable ability, but because 
<A NAME="787"></A>he was equal to business and was not too great for it.
<A NAME="788"></A><BR><BR>Quintus Plautius and Sextus Papinius were the next consuls. The 
<A NAME="789"></A>fact that that year Lucius Aruseius was put to death did not strike men 
<A NAME="790"></A>as anything horrible, from their familiarity with evil deeds. But there 
<A NAME="791"></A>was a panic when Vibulenus Agrippa, a Roman knight, as soon as his accusers 
<A NAME="792"></A>had finished their case, took from his robe, in the very Senate-house, 
<A NAME="793"></A>a dose of poison, drank it off, and, as he fell expiring, was hurried away 
<A NAME="794"></A>to prison by the prompt hands of lictors, where the neck of the now lifeless 
<A NAME="795"></A>man was crushed with the halter. Even Tigranes, who had once ruled Armenia 
<A NAME="796"></A>and was now impeached, did not escape the punishment of an ordinary citizen 
<A NAME="797"></A>on the strength of his royal title.
<A NAME="798"></A><BR><BR>Caius Galba meanwhile and the Blaesi perished by a voluntary death; 
<A NAME="799"></A>Galba, because a harsh letter from the emperor forbade him to have a province 
<A NAME="800"></A>allotted to him; while, as for the Blaesi, the priesthoods intended for 
<A NAME="801"></A>them during the prosperity of their house, Tiberius had withheld, when 
<A NAME="802"></A>that prosperity was shaken, and now conferred, as vacant offices, on others. 
<A NAME="803"></A>This they understood as a signal of their doom, and acted on 
<A NAME="804"></A>it.
<A NAME="805"></A><BR><BR>Aemilia Lepida too, whose marriage with the younger Drusus I have 
<A NAME="806"></A>already related, who, though she had pursued her husband with ceaseless 
<A NAME="807"></A>accusations, remained unpunished, infamous as she was, as long as her father 
<A NAME="808"></A>Lepidus lived, subsequently fell a victim to the informers for adultery 
<A NAME="809"></A>with a slave. There was no question about her guilt, and so without an 
<A NAME="810"></A>attempt at defence she put an end to her life.
<A NAME="811"></A><BR><BR>At this same time the Clitae, a tribe subject to the Cappadocian 
<A NAME="812"></A>Archelaus, retreated to the heights of Mount Taurus, because they were 
<A NAME="813"></A>compelled in Roman fashion to render an account of their revenue and submit 
<A NAME="814"></A>to tribute. There they defended themselves by means of the nature of the 
<A NAME="815"></A>country against the king's unwarlike troops, till Marcus Trebellius, whom 
<A NAME="816"></A>Vitellius, the governor of Syria, sent as his lieutenant with four thousand 
<A NAME="817"></A>legionaries and some picked auxiliaries, surrounded with his lines two 
<A NAME="818"></A>hills occupied by the barbarians, the lesser of which was named Cadra, 
<A NAME="819"></A>the other Davara. Those who dared to sally out, he reduced to surrender 
<A NAME="820"></A>by the sword, the rest by drought.
<A NAME="821"></A><BR><BR>Tiridates meanwhile, with the consent of the Parthians, received 
<A NAME="822"></A>the submission of Nicephorium, Anthemusias and the other cities, which 
<A NAME="823"></A>having been founded by Macedonians, claim Greek names, also of the Parthian 
<A NAME="824"></A>towns Halus and Artemita. There was a rivalry of joy among the inhabitants 
<A NAME="825"></A>who detested Artabanus, bred as he had been among the Scythians, for his 
<A NAME="826"></A>cruelty, and hoped to find in Tiridates a kindly spirit from his Roman 
<A NAME="827"></A>training.
<A NAME="828"></A><BR><BR>Seleucia, a powerful and fortified city which had never lapsed 
<A NAME="829"></A>into barbarism, but had clung loyally to its founder Seleucus, assumed 
<A NAME="830"></A>the most marked tone of flattery. Three hundred citizens, chosen for wealth 
<A NAME="831"></A>or wisdom, form a kind of senate, and the people have powers of their own. 
<A NAME="832"></A>When both act in concert, they look with contempt on the Parthians; as 
<A NAME="833"></A>soon as they are at discord, and the respective leaders invite aid for 
<A NAME="834"></A>themselves against their rivals, the ally summoned to help a faction crushes 
<A NAME="835"></A>them all. This had lately happened in the reign of Artabanus, who, for 
<A NAME="836"></A>his own interest, put the people at the mercy of the nobles. As a fact, 
<A NAME="837"></A>popular government almost amounts to freedom, while the rule of the few 
<A NAME="838"></A>approaches closely to a monarch's caprice.
<A NAME="839"></A><BR><BR>Seleucia now celebrated the arrival of Tiridates with all the honours 
<A NAME="840"></A>paid to princes of old and all which modern times, with a more copious 
<A NAME="841"></A>inventiveness, have devised. Reproaches were at the same time heaped on 
<A NAME="842"></A>Artabanus, as an Arsacid indeed on his mother's side, but as in all else 
<A NAME="843"></A>degenerate. Tiridates gave the government of Seleucia to the people. Soon 
<A NAME="844"></A>afterwards, as he was deliberating on what day he should inaugurate his 
<A NAME="845"></A>reign, he received letters from Phraates and Hiero, who held two very powerful 
<A NAME="846"></A>provinces, imploring a brief delay. It was thought best to wait for men 
<A NAME="847"></A>of such commanding influence, and meanwhile Ctesiphon, the seat of empire, 
<A NAME="848"></A>was their chosen destination. But as they postponed their coming from day 
<A NAME="849"></A>to day, the Surena, in the presence of an approving throng, crowned Tiridates, 
<A NAME="850"></A>according to the national usage, with the royal diadem.
<A NAME="851"></A><BR><BR>And now had he instantly made his way to the heart of the country 
<A NAME="852"></A>and to its other tribes, the reluctance of those who wavered, would have 
<A NAME="853"></A>been overpowered, and all to a man would have yielded. By besieging a fortress 
<A NAME="854"></A>into which Artabanus had conveyed his treasure and his concubines, he gave 
<A NAME="855"></A>them time to disown their compact. Phraates and Hiero, with others who 
<A NAME="856"></A>had not united in celebrating the day fixed for the coronation, some from 
<A NAME="857"></A>fear, some out of jealousy of Abdageses, who then ruled the court and the 
<A NAME="858"></A>new king, transferred their allegiance to Artabanus. They found him in 
<A NAME="859"></A>Hyrcania, covered with filth and procuring sustenance with his bow. He 
<A NAME="860"></A>was at first alarmed under the impression that treachery was intended, 
<A NAME="861"></A>but when they pledged their honour that they had come to restore to him 
<A NAME="862"></A>his dominion, his spirit revived, and he asked what the sudden change meant. 
<A NAME="863"></A>Hiero then spoke insultingly of the boyish years of Tiridates, hinting 
<A NAME="864"></A>that the throne was not held by an Arsacid, but that a mere empty name 
<A NAME="865"></A>was enjoyed by a feeble creature bred in foreign effeminacy, while the 
<A NAME="866"></A>actual power was in the house of Abdageses.
<A NAME="867"></A><BR><BR>An experienced king, Artabanus knew that men do not necessarily 
<A NAME="868"></A>feign hatred because they are false in friendship. He delayed only while 
<A NAME="869"></A>he was raising auxiliaries in Scythia, and then pushed on in haste, thus 
<A NAME="870"></A>anticipating the plots of enemies and the fickleness of friends. Wishing 
<A NAME="871"></A>to attract popular sympathy, he did not even cast off his miserable garb. 
<A NAME="872"></A>He stooped to wiles and to entreaties, to anything indeed by which he might 
<A NAME="873"></A>allure the wavering and confirm the willing.
<A NAME="874"></A><BR><BR>He was now approaching the neighbourhood of Seleucia with a large 
<A NAME="875"></A>force, while Tiridates, dismayed by the rumour. and then by the king's 
<A NAME="876"></A>presence in person, was divided in mind, and doubted whether he should 
<A NAME="877"></A>march against him or prolong the war by delay. Those who wished for battle 
<A NAME="878"></A>with its prompt decision argued that ill-arrayed levies fatigued by a long 
<A NAME="879"></A>march could not even in heart be thoroughly united in obedience, traitors 
<A NAME="880"></A>and enemies as they had lately been, to the prince whom now again they 
<A NAME="881"></A>were supporting. Abdageses, however, advised a retreat into Mesopotamia. 
<A NAME="882"></A>There, with a river in their front, they might in the interval summon to 
<A NAME="883"></A>their aid the Armenians and Elymaeans and other nations in their rear, 
<A NAME="884"></A>and then, reinforced by allies and troops which would be sent by the Roman 
<A NAME="885"></A>general, they might try the fortune of war. This advice prevailed, for 
<A NAME="886"></A>Abdageses had the chief influence and Tiridates was a coward in the face 
<A NAME="887"></A>of danger. But their retreat resembled a flight. The Arabs made a beginning, 
<A NAME="888"></A>and then the rest went to their homes or to the camp of Artabanus, till 
<A NAME="889"></A>Tiridates returned to Syria with a few followers and thus relieved all 
<A NAME="890"></A>from the disgrace of desertion.
<A NAME="891"></A><BR><BR>That same year Rome suffered from a terrible fire, and part of 
<A NAME="892"></A>the circus near the Aventine hill was burnt, as well as the Aventine quarter 
<A NAME="893"></A>itself. This calamity the emperor turned to his own glory by paying the 
<A NAME="894"></A>values of the houses and blocks of tenements. A hundred million of sesterces 
<A NAME="895"></A>was expended in this munificence, a boon all the more acceptable to the 
<A NAME="896"></A>populace, as Tiberius was rather sparing in building at his private expense. 
<A NAME="897"></A>He raised only two structures even at the public cost, the temple of Augustus 
<A NAME="898"></A>and the stage of Pompey's theatre, and when these were completed, he did 
<A NAME="899"></A>not dedicate them, either out of contempt for popularity or from his extreme 
<A NAME="900"></A>age. Four commissioners, all husbands of the emperor's granddaughters- 
<A NAME="901"></A>Cneius Domitius, Cassius Longinus, Marcus Vinicius, Rubellius Blandus- 
<A NAME="902"></A>were appointed to assess the damage in each case, and Publius Petronius 
<A NAME="903"></A>was added to their number on the nomination of the consuls. Various honours 
<A NAME="904"></A>were devised and decreed to the emperor such as each man's ingenuity suggested. 
<A NAME="905"></A>It is a question which of these he rejected or accepted, as the end of 
<A NAME="906"></A>his life was so near.
<A NAME="907"></A><BR><BR>For soon afterwards Tiberius's last consuls, Cneius Acerronius 
<A NAME="908"></A>and Caius Pontius, entered on office, Macro's power being now excessive. 
<A NAME="909"></A>Every day the man cultivated more assiduously than ever the favour of Caius 
<A NAME="910"></A>Caesar, which, indeed, he had never neglected, and after the death of Claudia, 
<A NAME="911"></A>who had, as I have related, been married to Caius, he had prompted his 
<A NAME="912"></A>wife Ennia to inveigle the young prince by a pretence of love, and to bind 
<A NAME="913"></A>him by an engagement of marriage, and the lad, provided he could secure 
<A NAME="914"></A>the throne, shrank from no conditions. For though he was of an excitable 
<A NAME="915"></A>temper, he had thoroughly learnt the falsehoods of hypocrisy under the 
<A NAME="916"></A>loving care of his grandfather.
<A NAME="917"></A><BR><BR>This the emperor knew, and he therefore hesitated about bequeathing 
<A NAME="918"></A>the empire, first, between his grandsons. Of these, the son of Drusus was 
<A NAME="919"></A>nearest in blood and natural affection, but he was still in his childhood. 
<A NAME="920"></A>Germanicus's son was in the vigour of youth and enjoyed the people's favour, 
<A NAME="921"></A>a reason for having his grandfather's hatred. Tiberius had even thought 
<A NAME="922"></A>of Claudius, as he was of sedate age and had a taste for liberal culture, 
<A NAME="923"></A>but a weak intellect was against him. If however he were to seek a successor 
<A NAME="924"></A>outside of his house, he feared that the memory of Augustus and the name 
<A NAME="925"></A>of the Caesars would become a laughing-stock and a scorn. It was, in fact, 
<A NAME="926"></A>not so much popularity in the present for which he cared as for glory in 
<A NAME="927"></A>the future.
<A NAME="928"></A><BR><BR>Perplexed in mind, exhausted in body, he soon left to destiny a 
<A NAME="929"></A>question to which he was unequal, though he threw out some hints from which 
<A NAME="930"></A>it might be inferred that he foresaw what was to come. He taunted Macro, 
<A NAME="931"></A>in no obscure terms, with forsaking the setting and looking to the rising 
<A NAME="932"></A>sun. Once too when Caius Caesar in a casual conversation ridiculed Lucius 
<A NAME="933"></A>Sulla, he predicted to him that he would have all Sulla's vices and none 
<A NAME="934"></A>of his virtues. At the same moment he embraced the younger of his two grandsons 
<A NAME="935"></A>with a flood of tears, and, noting the savage face of the other, said, 
<A NAME="936"></A>"You will slay this boy, and will be yourself slain by another." But even 
<A NAME="937"></A>while his strength was fast failing he gave up none of his debaucheries. 
<A NAME="938"></A>In his sufferings he would simulate health, and was wont to jest at the 
<A NAME="939"></A>arts of the physician and at all who, after the age of thirty, require 
<A NAME="940"></A>another man's advice to distinguish between what is beneficial or hurtful 
<A NAME="941"></A>to their constitutions.
<A NAME="942"></A><BR><BR>At Rome meanwhile were being sown the seeds of bloodshed to come 
<A NAME="943"></A>even after Tiberius's death. Acutia, formerly the wife of Publius Vitellius, 
<A NAME="944"></A>had been accused of treason by Laelius Balbus. When on her condemnation 
<A NAME="945"></A>a reward was being voted to her prosecutor, Junius Otho, tribune of the 
<A NAME="946"></A>people, interposed his veto. Hence a feud between Vitellius and Otho, ending 
<A NAME="947"></A>in Otho's banishment. Then Albucilla, notorious for the number of her lovers, 
<A NAME="948"></A>who had been married to Satrius Secundus, the betrayer of the late conspiracy, 
<A NAME="949"></A>was charged with irreverence towards the emperor. With her were involved 
<A NAME="950"></A>as her accomplices and paramours Cneius Domitius, Vibius Marsus and Lucius 
<A NAME="951"></A>Arruntius. I have already spoken of the illustrious rank of Domitius. Marsus 
<A NAME="952"></A>too was distinguished by the honours of his ancestors and by his own attainments. 
<A NAME="953"></A>It was, however, stated in the notes of the proceedings furnished to the 
<A NAME="954"></A>Senate that Macro had superintended the examination of the witnesses and 
<A NAME="955"></A>the torture of the slaves, and the fact that there was no letter from the 
<A NAME="956"></A>emperor against the defendants caused a suspicion that, while he was very 
<A NAME="957"></A>feeble and possibly ignorant of the matter, the charge was to a great extent 
<A NAME="958"></A>invented to gratify Macro's well-known enmity against 
<A NAME="959"></A>Arruntius.
<A NAME="960"></A><BR><BR>And so Domitius and Marsus prolonged their lives, Domitius, preparing 
<A NAME="961"></A>his defence, Marsus, having apparently resolved on starvation. Arruntius, 
<A NAME="962"></A>when his friends advised delay and temporising, replied that "the same 
<A NAME="963"></A>conduct was not becoming in all persons. He had had enough of life, and 
<A NAME="964"></A>all he regretted was that he had endured amid scorn and peril an old age 
<A NAME="965"></A>of anxious fears, long detested by Sejanus, now by Macro, always, indeed, 
<A NAME="966"></A>by some powerful minister, not for any fault, but as a man who could not 
<A NAME="967"></A>tolerate gross iniquities. Granted the possibility of passing safely through 
<A NAME="968"></A>the few last days of Tiberius. How was he to be secure under the youth 
<A NAME="969"></A>of the coming sovereign? Was it probable that, when Tiberius with his long 
<A NAME="970"></A>experience of affairs was, under the influence of absolute power, wholly 
<A NAME="971"></A>perverted and changed, Caius Caesar, who had hardly completed his boyhood, 
<A NAME="972"></A>was thoroughly ignorant and bred under the vilest training, would enter 
<A NAME="973"></A>on a better course, with Macro for his guide, who having been selected 
<A NAME="974"></A>for his superior wickedness, to crush Sejanus had by yet more numerous 
<A NAME="975"></A>crimes been the scourge of the State? He now foresaw a still more galling 
<A NAME="976"></A>slavery, and therefore sought to flee alike from the past and from the 
<A NAME="977"></A>impending future."
<A NAME="978"></A><BR><BR>While he thus spoke like a prophet, he opened his veins. What followed 
<A NAME="979"></A>will be a proof that Arruntius rightly chose death. Albucilla, having stabbed 
<A NAME="980"></A>herself with an ineffectual wound, was by the Senate's order carried off 
<A NAME="981"></A>to prison. Those who had ministered to her profligacy, Carsidius Sacerdos, 
<A NAME="982"></A>an ex-praetor, and Pontius Fregellanus were sentenced, respectively, to 
<A NAME="983"></A>transportation to an island and to loss of a senator's rank. A like punishment 
<A NAME="984"></A>was adjudged in the case of Laelius Balbus, and, indeed, with intense satisfaction, 
<A NAME="985"></A>as Balbus was noted for his savage eloquence and his eagerness to assail 
<A NAME="986"></A>the innocent.
<A NAME="987"></A><BR><BR>About the same time Sextus Papinius, who belonged to a family of 
<A NAME="988"></A>consular rank, chose a sudden and shocking death, by throwing himself from 
<A NAME="989"></A>a height. The cause was ascribed to his mother who, having been repeatedly 
<A NAME="990"></A>repulsed in her overtures, had at last by her arts and seductions driven 
<A NAME="991"></A>him to an extremity from which he could find no escape but death. She was 
<A NAME="992"></A>accordingly put on her trial before the Senate, and, although she grovelled 
<A NAME="993"></A>at the knees of the senators and long urged a parent's grief, the greater 
<A NAME="994"></A>weakness of a woman's mind under such an affliction and other sad and pitiful 
<A NAME="995"></A>pleas of the same painful kind, she was after all banished from Rome for 
<A NAME="996"></A>ten years, till her younger son would have passed the frail period of 
<A NAME="997"></A>youth.
<A NAME="998"></A><BR><BR>Tiberius's bodily powers were now leaving him, but not his skill 
<A NAME="999"></A>in dissembling. There was the same stern spirit; he had his words and looks 
<A NAME="1000"></A>under strict control, and occasionally would try to hide his weakness, 
<A NAME="1001"></A>evident as it was, by a forced politeness. After frequent changes of place, 
<A NAME="1002"></A>he at last settled down on the promontory of Misenum in a country-house 
<A NAME="1003"></A>once owned by Lucius Lucullus. There it was noted, in this way, that he 
<A NAME="1004"></A>was drawing near his end. There was a physician, distinguished in his profession, 
<A NAME="1005"></A>of the name of Charicles, usually employed, not indeed to have the direction 
<A NAME="1006"></A>of the emperor's varying health, but to put his advice at immediate disposal. 
<A NAME="1007"></A>This man, as if he were leaving on business his own, clasped his hand, 
<A NAME="1008"></A>with a show of homage, and touched his pulse. Tiberius noticed it. Whether 
<A NAME="1009"></A>he was displeased and strove the more to hide his anger, is a question; 
<A NAME="1010"></A>at any rate, he ordered the banquet to be renewed, and sat at the table 
<A NAME="1011"></A>longer than usual, by way, apparently, of showing honour to his departing 
<A NAME="1012"></A>friend. Charicles, however, assured Macro that his breath was failing and 
<A NAME="1013"></A>that he would not last more than two days. All was at once hurry; there 
<A NAME="1014"></A>were conferences among those on the spot and despatches to the generals 
<A NAME="1015"></A>and armies. On the 15th of March, his breath failing, he was believed to 
<A NAME="1016"></A>have expired, and Caius Caesar was going forth with a numerous throng of 
<A NAME="1017"></A>congratulating followers to take the first possession of the empire, when 
<A NAME="1018"></A>suddenly news came that Tiberius was recovering his voice and sight, and 
<A NAME="1019"></A>calling for persons to bring him food to revive him from his faintness. 
<A NAME="1020"></A>Then ensued a universal panic, and while the rest fled hither and thither, 
<A NAME="1021"></A>every one feigning grief or ignorance, Caius Caesar, in silent stupor, 
<A NAME="1022"></A>passed from the highest hopes to the extremity of apprehension. Macro, 
<A NAME="1023"></A>nothing daunted, ordered the old emperor to be smothered under a huge heap 
<A NAME="1024"></A>of clothes, and all to quit the entrance-hall.
<A NAME="1025"></A><BR><BR>And so died Tiberius, in the seventy eighth year of his age. Nero 
<A NAME="1026"></A>was his father, and he was on both sides descended from the Claudian house, 
<A NAME="1027"></A>though his mother passed by adoption, first into the Livian, then into 
<A NAME="1028"></A>the Julian family. From earliest infancy, perilous vicissitudes were his 
<A NAME="1029"></A>lot. Himself an exile, he was the companion of a proscribed father, and 
<A NAME="1030"></A>on being admitted as a stepson into the house of Augustus, he had to struggle 
<A NAME="1031"></A>with many rivals, so long as Marcellus and Agrippa and, subsequently, Caius 
<A NAME="1032"></A>and Lucius Caesar were in their glory. Again his brother Drusus enjoyed 
<A NAME="1033"></A>in a greater degree the affection of the citizens. But he was more than 
<A NAME="1034"></A>ever on dangerous ground after his marriage with Julia, whether he tolerated 
<A NAME="1035"></A>or escaped from his wife's profligacy. On his return from Rhodes he ruled 
<A NAME="1036"></A>the emperor's now heirless house for twelve years, and the Roman world, 
<A NAME="1037"></A>with absolute sway, for about twenty-three. His character too had its distinct 
<A NAME="1038"></A>periods. It was a bright time in his life and reputation, while under Augustus 
<A NAME="1039"></A>he was a private citizen or held high offices; a time of reserve and crafty 
<A NAME="1040"></A>assumption of virtue, as long as Germanicus and Drusus were alive. Again, 
<A NAME="1041"></A>while his mother lived, he was a compound of good and evil; he was infamous 
<A NAME="1042"></A>for his cruelty, though he veiled his debaucheries, while he loved or feared 
<A NAME="1043"></A>Sejanus. Finally, he plunged into every wickedness and disgrace, when fear 
<A NAME="1044"></A>and shame being cast off, he simply indulged his own 
<A NAME="1045"></A>inclinations.
<A NAME="1046"></A><BR><BR>[The four following books and the beginning of Book XI, which are 
<A NAME="1047"></A>lost, contained the history of a period of nearly ten years, from A.D. 
<A NAME="1048"></A>37 to A.D. 47. These years included the reign of Caius Caesar (Caligula), 
<A NAME="1049"></A>the son of Germanicus by the elder Agrippina, and the first six years of 
<A NAME="1050"></A>the reign of Claudius. Caius Caesar's reign was three years ten months 
<A NAME="1051"></A>and eight days in duration. Claudius (Tiberius Claudius Drusus Nero Germanicus), 
<A NAME="1052"></A>the brother of Germanicus, succeeded him, at the age of fifty, and reigned 
<A NAME="1053"></A>from A.D. 41 to A.D. 54.
<A NAME="1054"></A><BR><BR>The Eleventh Book of the Annals opens with the seventh year of 
<A NAME="1055"></A>Claudius's reign. The power of his wife Messalina was then at its height. 
<A NAME="1056"></A>She was, it seems, jealous of a certain Poppaea Sabina, who is mentioned 
<A NAME="1057"></A>in Book XIII., as "having surpassed in beauty all the ladies of her day." 
<A NAME="1058"></A>This Poppaea was the daughter of the Poppaeus Sabinus alluded to in Book 
<A NAME="1059"></A>VI., and the mother of the more famous Poppaea, afterwards the wife of 
<A NAME="1060"></A>the emperor Nero. Messalina contrived to involve this lady and her lover, 
<A NAME="1061"></A>Valerius Asiaticus, in a ruinous charge. Asiaticus had been twice consul, 
<A NAME="1062"></A>once under Caius Caesar, a second time under Claudius in A.D. 46. He was 
<A NAME="1063"></A>rich as well as noble. The Eleventh Book, as we have it, begins with the 
<A NAME="1064"></A>account of his prosecution by means Messalina, who with the help of Lucius 
<A NAME="1065"></A>Vitellius, Vitellius, father of the Vitellius, afterwards emperor, effected 
<A NAME="1066"></A>his ruin.]
