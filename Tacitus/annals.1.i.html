<A NAME="start"></A>
<A NAME="10"></A>A.D. 14, 15
<A NAME="11"></A><BR><BR>Rome at the beginning was ruled by kings. Freedom and the consulship 
<A NAME="12"></A>were established by Lucius Brutus. Dictatorships were held for a temporary 
<A NAME="13"></A>crisis. The power of the decemvirs did not last beyond two years, nor was 
<A NAME="14"></A>the consular jurisdiction of the military tribunes of long duration. The 
<A NAME="15"></A>despotisms of Cinna and Sulla were brief; the rule of Pompeius and of Crassus 
<A NAME="16"></A>soon yielded before Caesar; the arms of Lepidus and Antonius before Augustus; 
<A NAME="17"></A>who, when the world was wearied by civil strife, subjected it to empire 
<A NAME="18"></A>under the title of "Prince." But the successes and reverses of the old 
<A NAME="19"></A>Roman people have been recorded by famous historians; and fine intellects 
<A NAME="20"></A>were not wanting to describe the times of Augustus, till growing sycophancy 
<A NAME="21"></A>scared them away. The histories of Tiberius, Caius, Claudius, and Nero, 
<A NAME="22"></A>while they were in power, were falsified through terror, and after their 
<A NAME="23"></A>death were written under the irritation of a recent hatred. Hence my purpose 
<A NAME="24"></A>is to relate a few facts about Augustus- more particularly his last acts, 
<A NAME="25"></A>then the reign of Tiberius, and all which follows, without either bitterness 
<A NAME="26"></A>or partiality, from any motives to which I am far removed.
<A NAME="27"></A><BR><BR>When after the destruction of Brutus and Cassius there was no longer 
<A NAME="28"></A>any army of the Commonwealth, when Pompeius was crushed in Sicily, and 
<A NAME="29"></A>when, with Lepidus pushed aside and Antonius slain, even the Julian faction 
<A NAME="30"></A>had only Caesar left to lead it, then, dropping the title of triumvir, 
<A NAME="31"></A>and giving out that he was a Consul, and was satisfied with a tribune's 
<A NAME="32"></A>authority for the protection of the people, Augustus won over the soldiers 
<A NAME="33"></A>with gifts, the populace with cheap corn, and all men with the sweets of 
<A NAME="34"></A>repose, and so grew greater by degrees, while he concentrated in himself 
<A NAME="35"></A>the functions of the Senate, the magistrates, and the laws. He was wholly 
<A NAME="36"></A>unopposed, for the boldest spirits had fallen in battle, or in the proscription, 
<A NAME="37"></A>while the remaining nobles, the readier they were to be slaves, were raised 
<A NAME="38"></A>the higher by wealth and promotion, so that, aggrandised by revolution, 
<A NAME="39"></A>they preferred the safety of the present to the dangerous past. Nor did 
<A NAME="40"></A>the provinces dislike that condition of affairs, for they distrusted the 
<A NAME="41"></A>government of the Senate and the people, because of the rivalries between 
<A NAME="42"></A>the leading men and the rapacity of the officials, while the protection 
<A NAME="43"></A>of the laws was unavailing, as they were continually deranged by violence, 
<A NAME="44"></A>intrigue, and finally by corruption.
<A NAME="45"></A><BR><BR>Augustus meanwhile, as supports to his despotism, raised to the 
<A NAME="46"></A>pontificate and curule aedileship Claudius Marcellus, his sister's son, 
<A NAME="47"></A>while a mere stripling, and Marcus Agrippa, of humble birth, a good soldier, 
<A NAME="48"></A>and one who had shared his victory, to two consecutive consulships, and 
<A NAME="49"></A>as Marcellus soon afterwards died, he also accepted him as his son-in-law. 
<A NAME="50"></A>Tiberius Nero and Claudius Drusus, his stepsons, he honoured with imperial 
<A NAME="51"></A>tides, although his own family was as yet undiminished. For he had admitted 
<A NAME="52"></A>the children of Agrippa, Caius and Lucius, into the house of the Caesars; 
<A NAME="53"></A>and before they had yet laid aside the dress of boyhood he had most fervently 
<A NAME="54"></A>desired, with an outward show of reluctance, that they should be entitled 
<A NAME="55"></A>"princes of the youth," and be consuls-elect. When Agrippa died, and Lucius 
<A NAME="56"></A>Caesar as he was on his way to our armies in Spain, and Caius while returning 
<A NAME="57"></A>from Armenia, still suffering from a wound, were prematurely cut off by 
<A NAME="58"></A>destiny, or by their step-mother Livia's treachery, Drusus too having long 
<A NAME="59"></A>been dead, Nero remained alone of the stepsons, and in him everything tended 
<A NAME="60"></A>to centre. He was adopted as a son, as a colleague in empire and a partner 
<A NAME="61"></A>in the tribunitian power, and paraded through all the armies, no longer 
<A NAME="62"></A>through his mother's secret intrigues, but at her open suggestion. For 
<A NAME="63"></A>she had gained such a hold on the aged Augustus that he drove out as an 
<A NAME="64"></A>exile into the island of Planasia, his only grandson, Agrippa Postumus, 
<A NAME="65"></A>who, though devoid of worthy qualities, and having only the brute courage 
<A NAME="66"></A>of physical strength, had not been convicted of any gross offence. And 
<A NAME="67"></A>yet Augustus had appointed Germanicus, Drusus's offspring, to the command 
<A NAME="68"></A>of eight legions on the Rhine, and required Tiberius to adopt him, although 
<A NAME="69"></A>Tiberius had a son, now a young man, in his house; but he did it that he 
<A NAME="70"></A>might have several safeguards to rest on. He had no war at the time on 
<A NAME="71"></A>his hands except against the Germans, which was rather to wipe out the 
<A NAME="72"></A>disgrace of the loss of Quintilius Varus and his army than out of an ambition 
<A NAME="73"></A>to extend the empire, or for any adequate recompense. At home all was tranquil, 
<A NAME="74"></A>and there were magistrates with the same titles; there was a younger generation, 
<A NAME="75"></A>sprung up since the victory of Actium, and even many of the older men had 
<A NAME="76"></A>been born during the civil wars. How few were left who had seen the 
<A NAME="77"></A>republic!
<A NAME="78"></A><BR><BR>Thus the State had been revolutionised, and there was not a vestige 
<A NAME="79"></A>left of the old sound morality. Stript of equality, all looked up to the 
<A NAME="80"></A>commands of a sovereign without the least apprehension for the present, 
<A NAME="81"></A>while Augustus in the vigour of life, could maintain his own position, 
<A NAME="82"></A>that of his house, and the general tranquillity. When in advanced old age, 
<A NAME="83"></A>he was worn out by a sickly frame, and the end was near and new prospects 
<A NAME="84"></A>opened, a few spoke in vain of the blessings of freedom, but most people 
<A NAME="85"></A>dreaded and some longed for war. The popular gossip of the large majority 
<A NAME="86"></A>fastened itself variously on their future masters. "Agrippa was savage, 
<A NAME="87"></A>and had been exasperated by insult, and neither from age nor experience 
<A NAME="88"></A>in affairs was equal to so great a burden. Tiberius Nero was of mature 
<A NAME="89"></A>years, and had established his fame in war, but he had the old arrogance 
<A NAME="90"></A>inbred in the Claudian family, and many symptoms of a cruel temper, though 
<A NAME="91"></A>they were repressed, now and then broke out. He had also from earliest 
<A NAME="92"></A>infancy been reared in an imperial house; consulships and triumphs had 
<A NAME="93"></A>been heaped on him in his younger days; even in the years which, on the 
<A NAME="94"></A>pretext of seclusion he spent in exile at Rhodes, he had had no thoughts 
<A NAME="95"></A>but of wrath, hypocrisy, and secret sensuality. There was his mother too 
<A NAME="96"></A>with a woman caprice. They must, it seemed, be subject to a female and 
<A NAME="97"></A>to two striplings besides, who for a while would burden, and some day rend 
<A NAME="98"></A>asunder the State."
<A NAME="99"></A><BR><BR>While these and like topics were discussed, the infirmities of 
<A NAME="100"></A>Augustus increased, and some suspected guilt on his wife's part. For a 
<A NAME="101"></A>rumour had gone abroad that a few months before he had sailed to Planasia 
<A NAME="102"></A>on a visit to Agrippa, with the knowledge of some chosen friends, and with 
<A NAME="103"></A>one companion, Fabius Maximus; that many tears were shed on both sides, 
<A NAME="104"></A>with expressions of affection, and that thus there was a hope of the young 
<A NAME="105"></A>man being restored to the home of his grandfather. This, it was said, Maximus 
<A NAME="106"></A>had divulged to his wife Marcia, she again to Livia. All was known to Caesar, 
<A NAME="107"></A>and when Maximus soon afterwards died, by a death some thought to be self-inflicted, 
<A NAME="108"></A>there were heard at his funeral wailings from Marcia, in which she reproached 
<A NAME="109"></A>herself for having been the cause of her husband's destruction. Whatever 
<A NAME="110"></A>the fact was, Tiberius as he was just entering Illyria was summoned home 
<A NAME="111"></A>by an urgent letter from his mother, and it has not been thoroughly ascertained 
<A NAME="112"></A>whether at the city of Nola he found Augustus still breathing or quite 
<A NAME="113"></A>lifeless. For Livia had surrounded the house and its approaches with a 
<A NAME="114"></A>strict watch, and favourable bulletins were published from time to time, 
<A NAME="115"></A>till, provision having been made for the demands of the crisis, one and 
<A NAME="116"></A>the same report told men that Augustus was dead and that Tiberius Nero 
<A NAME="117"></A>was master of the State.
<A NAME="118"></A><BR><BR>The first crime of the new reign was the murder of Postumus Agrippa. 
<A NAME="119"></A>Though he was surprised and unarmed, a centurion of the firmest resolution 
<A NAME="120"></A>despatched him with difficulty. Tiberius gave no explanation of the matter 
<A NAME="121"></A>to the Senate; he pretended that there were directions from his father 
<A NAME="122"></A>ordering the tribune in charge of the prisoner not to delay the slaughter 
<A NAME="123"></A>of Agrippa, whenever he should himself have breathed his last. Beyond a 
<A NAME="124"></A>doubt, Augustus had often complained of the young man's character, and 
<A NAME="125"></A>had thus succeeded in obtaining the sanction of a decree of the Senate 
<A NAME="126"></A>for his banishment. But he never was hard-hearted enough to destroy any 
<A NAME="127"></A>of his kinsfolk, nor was it credible that death was to be the sentence 
<A NAME="128"></A>of the grandson in order that the stepson might feel secure. It was more 
<A NAME="129"></A>probable that Tiberius and Livia, the one from fear, the other from a stepmother's 
<A NAME="130"></A>enmity, hurried on the destruction of a youth whom they suspected and hated. 
<A NAME="131"></A>When the centurion reported, according to military custom, that he had 
<A NAME="132"></A>executed the command, Tiberius replied that he had not given the command, 
<A NAME="133"></A>and that the act must be justified to the Senate.
<A NAME="134"></A><BR><BR>As soon as Sallustius Crispus who shared the secret (he had, in 
<A NAME="135"></A>fact, sent the written order to the tribune) knew this, fearing that the 
<A NAME="136"></A>charge would be shifted on himself, and that his peril would be the same 
<A NAME="137"></A>whether he uttered fiction or truth, he advised Livia not to divulge the 
<A NAME="138"></A>secrets of her house or the counsels of friends, or any services performed 
<A NAME="139"></A>by the soldiers, nor to let Tiberius weaken the strength of imperial power 
<A NAME="140"></A>by referring everything to the Senate, for "the condition," he said, "of 
<A NAME="141"></A>holding empire is that an account cannot be balanced unless it be rendered 
<A NAME="142"></A>to one person."
<A NAME="143"></A><BR><BR>Meanwhile at Rome people plunged into slavery- consuls, senators, 
<A NAME="144"></A>knights. The higher a man's rank, the more eager his hypocrisy, and his 
<A NAME="145"></A>looks the more carefully studied, so as neither to betray joy at the decease 
<A NAME="146"></A>of one emperor nor sorrow at the rise of another, while he mingled delight 
<A NAME="147"></A>and lamentations with his flattery. Sextus Pompeius and Sextus Apuleius, 
<A NAME="148"></A>the consuls, were the first to swear allegiance to Tiberius Caesar, and 
<A NAME="149"></A>in their presence the oath was taken by Seius Strabo and Caius Turranius, 
<A NAME="150"></A>respectively the commander of the praetorian cohorts and the superintendent 
<A NAME="151"></A>of the corn supplies. Then the Senate, the soldiers and the people did 
<A NAME="152"></A>the same. For Tiberius would inaugurate everything with the consuls, as 
<A NAME="153"></A>though the ancient constitution remained, and he hesitated about being 
<A NAME="154"></A>emperor. Even the proclamation by which he summoned the senators to their 
<A NAME="155"></A>chamber, he issued merely with the title of Tribune, which he had received 
<A NAME="156"></A>under Augustus. The wording of the proclamation was brief, and in a very 
<A NAME="157"></A>modest tone. "He would," it said, "provide for the honours due to his father, 
<A NAME="158"></A>and not leave the lifeless body, and this was the only public duty he now 
<A NAME="159"></A>claimed."
<A NAME="160"></A><BR><BR>As soon, however, as Augustus was dead, he had given the watchword 
<A NAME="161"></A>to the praetorian cohorts, as commander-in-chief. He had the guard under 
<A NAME="162"></A>arms, with all the other adjuncts of a court; soldiers attended him to 
<A NAME="163"></A>the forum; soldiers went with him to the Senate House. He sent letters 
<A NAME="164"></A>to the different armies, as though supreme power was now his, and showed 
<A NAME="165"></A>hesitation only when he spoke in the Senate. His chief motive was fear 
<A NAME="166"></A>that Germanicus, who had at his disposal so many legions, such vast auxiliary 
<A NAME="167"></A>forces of the allies, and such wonderful popularity, might prefer the possession 
<A NAME="168"></A>to the expectation of empire. He looked also at public opinion, wishing 
<A NAME="169"></A>to have the credit of having been called and elected by the State rather 
<A NAME="170"></A>than of having crept into power through the intrigues of a wife and a dotard's 
<A NAME="171"></A>adoption. It was subsequently understood that he assumed a wavering attitude, 
<A NAME="172"></A>to test likewise the temper of the nobles. For he would twist a word or 
<A NAME="173"></A>a look into a crime and treasure it up in his memory.
<A NAME="174"></A><BR><BR>On the first day of the Senate he allowed nothing to be discussed 
<A NAME="175"></A>but the funeral of Augustus, whose will, which was brought in by the Vestal 
<A NAME="176"></A>Virgins, named as his heirs Tiberius and Livia. The latter was to be admitted 
<A NAME="177"></A>into the Julian family with the name of Augusta; next in expectation were 
<A NAME="178"></A>the grand and great-grandchildren. In the third place, he had named the 
<A NAME="179"></A>chief men of the State, most of whom he hated, simply out of ostentation 
<A NAME="180"></A>and to win credit with posterity. His legacies were not beyond the scale 
<A NAME="181"></A>of a private citizen, except a bequest of forty-three million five hundred 
<A NAME="182"></A>thousand sesterces "to the people and populace of Rome," of one thousand 
<A NAME="183"></A>to every praetorian soldier, and of three hundred to every man in the legionary 
<A NAME="184"></A>cohorts composed of Roman citizens.
<A NAME="185"></A><BR><BR>Next followed a deliberation about funeral honours. Of these the 
<A NAME="186"></A>most imposing were thought fitting. The procession was to be conducted 
<A NAME="187"></A>through "the gate of triumph," on the motion of Gallus Asinius; the titles 
<A NAME="188"></A>of the laws passed, the names of the nations conquered by Augustus were 
<A NAME="189"></A>to be borne in front, on that of Lucius Arruntius. Messala Valerius further 
<A NAME="190"></A>proposed that the oath of allegiance to Tiberius should be yearly renewed, 
<A NAME="191"></A>and when Tiberius asked him whether it was at his bidding that he had brought 
<A NAME="192"></A>forward this motion, he replied that he had proposed it spontaneously, 
<A NAME="193"></A>and that in whatever concerned the State he would use only his own discretion, 
<A NAME="194"></A>even at the risk of offending. This was the only style of adulation which 
<A NAME="195"></A>yet remained. The Senators unanimously exclaimed that the body ought to 
<A NAME="196"></A>be borne on their shoulders to the funeral pile. The emperor left the point 
<A NAME="197"></A>to them with disdainful moderation, he then admonished the people by a 
<A NAME="198"></A>proclamation not to indulge in that tumultuous enthusiasm which had distracted 
<A NAME="199"></A>the funeral of the Divine Julius, or express a wish that Augustus should 
<A NAME="200"></A>be burnt in the Forum instead of in his appointed resting-place in the 
<A NAME="201"></A>Campus Martius.
<A NAME="202"></A><BR><BR>On the day of the funeral soldiers stood round as a guard, amid 
<A NAME="203"></A>much ridicule from those who had either themselves witnessed or who had 
<A NAME="204"></A>heard from their parents of the famous day when slavery was still something 
<A NAME="205"></A>fresh, and freedom had been resought in vain, when the slaying of Caesar, 
<A NAME="206"></A>the Dictator, seemed to some the vilest, to others, the most glorious of 
<A NAME="207"></A>deeds. "Now," they said, "an aged sovereign, whose power had lasted long, 
<A NAME="208"></A>who had provided his heirs with abundant means to coerce the State, requires 
<A NAME="209"></A>forsooth the defence of soldiers that his burial may be 
<A NAME="210"></A>undisturbed."
<A NAME="211"></A><BR><BR>Then followed much talk about Augustus himself, and many expressed 
<A NAME="212"></A>an idle wonder that the same day marked the beginning of his assumption 
<A NAME="213"></A>of empire and the close of his life, and, again, that he had ended his 
<A NAME="214"></A>days at Nola in the same house and room as his father Octavius. People 
<A NAME="215"></A>extolled too the number of his consulships, in which he had equalled Valerius 
<A NAME="216"></A>Corvus and Caius Marius combined, the continuance for thirty-seven years 
<A NAME="217"></A>of the tribunitian power, the title of Imperator twenty-one times earned, 
<A NAME="218"></A>and his other honours which had either frequently repeated or were wholly 
<A NAME="219"></A>new. Sensible men, however, spoke variously of his life with praise and 
<A NAME="220"></A>censure. Some said "that dutiful feeling towards a father, and the necessities 
<A NAME="221"></A>of the State in which laws had then no place, drove him into civil war, 
<A NAME="222"></A>which can neither be planned nor conducted on any right principles. He 
<A NAME="223"></A>had often yielded to Antonius, while he was taking vengeance on his father's 
<A NAME="224"></A>murderers, often also to Lepidus. When the latter sank into feeble dotage 
<A NAME="225"></A>and the former had been ruined by his profligacy, the only remedy for his 
<A NAME="226"></A>distracted country was the rule of a single man. Yet the State had been 
<A NAME="227"></A>organized under the name neither of a kingdom nor a dictatorship, but under 
<A NAME="228"></A>that of a prince. The ocean and remote rivers were the boundaries of the 
<A NAME="229"></A>empire; the legions, provinces, fleets, all things were linked together; 
<A NAME="230"></A>there was law for the citizens; there was respect shown to the allies. 
<A NAME="231"></A>The capital had been embellished on a grand scale; only in a few instances 
<A NAME="232"></A>had he resorted to force, simply to secure general tranquillity."
<A NAME="233"></A><BR><BR>It was said, on the other hand, "that filial duty and State necessity 
<A NAME="234"></A>were merely assumed as a mask. It was really from a lust of sovereignty 
<A NAME="235"></A>that he had excited the veterans by bribery, had, when a young man and 
<A NAME="236"></A>a subject, raised an army, tampered with the Consul's legions, and feigned 
<A NAME="237"></A>an attachment to the faction of Pompeius. Then, when by a decree of the 
<A NAME="238"></A>Senate he had usurped the high functions and authority of Praetor when 
<A NAME="239"></A>Hirtius and Pansa were slain- whether they were destroyed by the enemy, 
<A NAME="240"></A>or Pansa by poison infused into a wound, Hirtius by his own soldiers and 
<A NAME="241"></A>Caesar's treacherous machinations- he at once possessed himself of both 
<A NAME="242"></A>their armies, wrested the consulate from a reluctant Senate, and turned 
<A NAME="243"></A>against the State the arms with which he had been intrusted against Antonius. 
<A NAME="244"></A>Citizens were proscribed, lands divided, without so much as the approval 
<A NAME="245"></A>of those who executed these deeds. Even granting that the deaths of Cassius 
<A NAME="246"></A>and of the Bruti were sacrifices to a hereditary enmity (though duty requires 
<A NAME="247"></A>us to waive private feuds for the sake of the public welfare), still Pompeius 
<A NAME="248"></A>had been deluded by the phantom of peace, and Lepidus by the mask of friendship. 
<A NAME="249"></A>Subsequently, Antonius had been lured on by the treaties of Tarentum and 
<A NAME="250"></A>Brundisium, and by his marriage with the sister, and paid by his death 
<A NAME="251"></A>the penalty of a treacherous alliance. No doubt, there was peace after 
<A NAME="252"></A>all this, but it was a peace stained with blood; there were the disasters 
<A NAME="253"></A>of Lollius and Varus, the murders at Rome of the Varros, Egnatii, and 
<A NAME="254"></A>Juli."
<A NAME="255"></A><BR><BR>The domestic life too of Augustus was not spared. "Nero's wife 
<A NAME="256"></A>had been taken from him, and there had been the farce of consulting the 
<A NAME="257"></A>pontiffs, whether, with a child conceived and not yet born, she could properly 
<A NAME="258"></A>marry. There were the excesses of Quintus Tedius and Vedius Pollio; last 
<A NAME="259"></A>of all, there was Livia, terrible to the State as a mother, terrible to 
<A NAME="260"></A>the house of the Caesars as a stepmother. No honour was left for the gods, 
<A NAME="261"></A>when Augustus chose to be himself worshipped with temples and statues, 
<A NAME="262"></A>like those of the deities, and with flamens and priests. He had not even 
<A NAME="263"></A>adopted Tiberius as his successor out of affection or any regard to the 
<A NAME="264"></A>State, but, having thoroughly seen his arrogant and savage temper, he had 
<A NAME="265"></A>sought glory for himself by a contrast of extreme wickedness." For, in 
<A NAME="266"></A>fact, Augustus, a few years before, when he was a second time asking from 
<A NAME="267"></A>the Senate the tribunitian power for Tiberius, though his speech was complimentary, 
<A NAME="268"></A>had thrown out certain hints as to his manners, style, and habits of life, 
<A NAME="269"></A>which he meant as reproaches, while he seemed to excuse. However, when 
<A NAME="270"></A>his obsequies had been duly performed, a temple with a religious ritual 
<A NAME="271"></A>was decreed him.
<A NAME="272"></A><BR><BR>After this all prayers were addressed to Tiberius. He, on his part, 
<A NAME="273"></A>urged various considerations, the greatness of the empire, his distrust 
<A NAME="274"></A>of himself. "Only," he said, "the intellect of the Divine Augustus was 
<A NAME="275"></A>equal to such a burden. Called as he had been by him to share his anxieties, 
<A NAME="276"></A>he had learnt by experience how exposed to fortune's caprices was the task 
<A NAME="277"></A>of universal rule. Consequently, in a state which had the support of so 
<A NAME="278"></A>many great men, they should not put everything on one man, as many, by 
<A NAME="279"></A>uniting their efforts would more easily discharge public functions." There 
<A NAME="280"></A>was more grand sentiment than good faith in such words. Tiberius's language 
<A NAME="281"></A>even in matters which he did not care to conceal, either from nature or 
<A NAME="282"></A>habit, was always hesitating and obscure, and now that he was struggling 
<A NAME="283"></A>to hide his feelings completely, it was all the more involved in uncertainty 
<A NAME="284"></A>and doubt. The Senators, however, whose only fear was lest they might seem 
<A NAME="285"></A>to understand him, burst into complaints, tears, and prayers. They raised 
<A NAME="286"></A>their hands to the gods, to the statue of Augustus, and to the knees of 
<A NAME="287"></A>Tiberius, when he ordered a document to be produced and read. This contained 
<A NAME="288"></A>a description of the resources of the State, of the number of citizens 
<A NAME="289"></A>and allies under arms, of the fleets, subject kingdoms, provinces, taxes, 
<A NAME="290"></A>direct and indirect, necessary expenses and customary bounties. All these 
<A NAME="291"></A>details Augustus had written with his own hand, and had added a counsel, 
<A NAME="292"></A>that the empire should be confined to its present limits, either from fear 
<A NAME="293"></A>or out of jealousy.
<A NAME="294"></A><BR><BR>Meantime, while the Senate stooped to the most abject supplication, 
<A NAME="295"></A>Tiberius happened to say that although he was not equal to the whole burden 
<A NAME="296"></A>of the State, yet he would undertake the charge of whatever part of it 
<A NAME="297"></A>might be intrusted to him. Thereupon Asinius Gallus said, "I ask you, Caesar, 
<A NAME="298"></A>what part of the State you wish to have intrusted to you?" Confounded by 
<A NAME="299"></A>the sudden inquiry he was silent for a few moments; then, recovering his 
<A NAME="300"></A>presence of mind, he replied that it would by no means become his modesty 
<A NAME="301"></A>to choose or to avoid in a case where he would prefer to be wholly excused. 
<A NAME="302"></A>Then Gallus again, who had inferred anger from his looks, said that the 
<A NAME="303"></A>question had not been asked with the intention of dividing what could not 
<A NAME="304"></A>be separated, but to convince him by his own admission that the body of 
<A NAME="305"></A>the State was one, and must be directed by a single mind. He further spoke 
<A NAME="306"></A>in praise of Augustus, and reminded Tiberius himself of his victories, 
<A NAME="307"></A>and of his admirable deeds for many years as a civilian. Still, he did 
<A NAME="308"></A>not thereby soften the emperor's resentment, for he had long been detested 
<A NAME="309"></A>from an impression that, as he had married Vipsania, daughter of Marcus 
<A NAME="310"></A>Agrippa, who had once been the wife of Tiberius, he aspired to be more 
<A NAME="311"></A>than a citizen, and kept up the arrogant tone of his father, Asinius 
<A NAME="312"></A>Pollio.
<A NAME="313"></A><BR><BR>Next, Lucius Arruntius, who differed but little from the speech 
<A NAME="314"></A>of Gallus, gave like offence, though Tiberius had no old grudge against 
<A NAME="315"></A>him, but simply mistrusted him, because he was rich and daring, had brilliant 
<A NAME="316"></A>accomplishments, and corresponding popularity. For Augustus, when in his 
<A NAME="317"></A>last conversations he was discussing who would refuse the highest place, 
<A NAME="318"></A>though sufficiently capable, who would aspire to it without being equal 
<A NAME="319"></A>to it, and who would unite both the ability and ambition, had described 
<A NAME="320"></A>Marcus Lepidus as able but contemptuously indifferent, Gallus Asinius as 
<A NAME="321"></A>ambitious and incapable, Lucius Arruntius as not unworthy of it, and, should 
<A NAME="322"></A>the chance be given him, sure to make the venture. About the two first 
<A NAME="323"></A>there is a general agreement, but instead of Arruntius some have mentioned 
<A NAME="324"></A>Cneius Piso, and all these men, except Lepidus, were soon afterwards destroyed 
<A NAME="325"></A>by various charges through the contrivance of Tiberius. Quintus Haterius 
<A NAME="326"></A>too and Mamercus Scaurus ruffled his suspicious temper, Haterius by having 
<A NAME="327"></A>said- "How long, Caesar, will you suffer the State to be without a head?" 
<A NAME="328"></A>Scaurus by the remark that there was a hope that the Senate's prayers would 
<A NAME="329"></A>not be fruitless, seeing that he had not used his right as Tribune to negative 
<A NAME="330"></A>the motion of the Consuls. Tiberius instantly broke out into invective 
<A NAME="331"></A>against Haterius; Scaurus, with whom he was far more deeply displeased, 
<A NAME="332"></A>he passed over in silence. Wearied at last by the assembly's clamorous 
<A NAME="333"></A>importunity and the urgent demands of individual Senators, he gave way 
<A NAME="334"></A>by degrees, not admitting that he undertook empire, but yet ceasing to 
<A NAME="335"></A>refuse it and to be entreated. It is known that Haterius having entered 
<A NAME="336"></A>the palace to ask pardon, and thrown himself at the knees of Tiberius as 
<A NAME="337"></A>he was walking, was almost killed by the soldiers, because Tiberius fell 
<A NAME="338"></A>forward, accidentally or from being entangled by the suppliant's hands. 
<A NAME="339"></A>Yet the peril of so great a man did not make him relent, till Haterius 
<A NAME="340"></A>went with entreaties to Augusta, and was saved by her very earnest 
<A NAME="341"></A>intercessions.
<A NAME="342"></A><BR><BR>Great too was the Senate's sycophancy to Augusta. Some would have 
<A NAME="343"></A>her styled "parent"; others "mother of the country," and a majority proposed 
<A NAME="344"></A>that to the name of Caesar should be added "son of Julia." The emperor 
<A NAME="345"></A>repeatedly asserted that there must be a limit to the honours paid to women, 
<A NAME="346"></A>and that he would observe similar moderation in those bestowed on himself, 
<A NAME="347"></A>but annoyed at the invidious proposal, and indeed regarding a woman's elevation 
<A NAME="348"></A>as a slight to himself, he would not allow so much as a lictor to be assigned 
<A NAME="349"></A>her, and forbade the erection of an altar in memory of her adoption, and 
<A NAME="350"></A>any like distinction. But for Germanicus Caesar he asked pro-consular powers, 
<A NAME="351"></A>and envoys were despatched to confer them on him, and also to express sympathy 
<A NAME="352"></A>with his grief at the death of Augustus. The same request was not made 
<A NAME="353"></A>for Drusus, because he was consul elect and present at Rome. Twelve candidates 
<A NAME="354"></A>were named for the praetorship, the number which Augustus had handed down, 
<A NAME="355"></A>and when the Senate urged Tiberius to increase it, he bound himself by 
<A NAME="356"></A>an oath not to exceed it.
<A NAME="357"></A><BR><BR>It was then for the first time that the elections were transferred 
<A NAME="358"></A>from the Campus Martius to the Senate. For up to that day, though the most 
<A NAME="359"></A>important rested with the emperor's choice, some were settled by the partialities 
<A NAME="360"></A>of the tribes. Nor did the people complain of having the right taken from 
<A NAME="361"></A>them, except in mere idle talk, and the Senate, being now released from 
<A NAME="362"></A>the necessity of bribery and of degrading solicitations, gladly upheld 
<A NAME="363"></A>the change, Tiberius confining himself to the recommendation of only four 
<A NAME="364"></A>candidates who were to be nominated without rejection or canvass. Meanwhile 
<A NAME="365"></A>the tribunes of the people asked leave to exhibit at their own expense 
<A NAME="366"></A>games to be named after Augustus and added to the Calendar as the Augustales. 
<A NAME="367"></A>Money was, however, voted from the exchequer, and though the use of the 
<A NAME="368"></A>triumphal robe in the circus was prescribed, it was not allowed them to 
<A NAME="369"></A>ride in a chariot. Soon the annual celebration was transferred to the praetor, 
<A NAME="370"></A>to whose lot fell the administration of justice between citizens and 
<A NAME="371"></A>foreigners.
<A NAME="372"></A><BR><BR>This was the state of affairs at Rome when a mutiny broke out in 
<A NAME="373"></A>the legions of Pannonia, which could be traced to no fresh cause except 
<A NAME="374"></A>the change of emperors and the prospect it held out of license in tumult 
<A NAME="375"></A>and of profit from a civil war. In the summer camp three legions were quartered, 
<A NAME="376"></A>under the command of Junius Blaesus, who on hearing of the death of Augustus 
<A NAME="377"></A>and the accession of Tiberius, had allowed his men a rest from military 
<A NAME="378"></A>duties, either for mourning or rejoicing. This was the beginning of demoralization 
<A NAME="379"></A>among the troops, of quarreling, of listening to the talk of every pestilent 
<A NAME="380"></A>fellow, in short, of craving for luxury and idleness and loathing discipline 
<A NAME="381"></A>and toil. In the camp was one Percennius, who had once been a leader of 
<A NAME="382"></A>one of the theatrical factions, then became a common soldier, had a saucy 
<A NAME="383"></A>tongue, and had learnt from his applause of actors how to stir up a crowd. 
<A NAME="384"></A>By working on ignorant minds, which doubted as to what would be the terms 
<A NAME="385"></A>of military service after Augustus, this man gradually influenced them 
<A NAME="386"></A>in conversations at night or at nightfall, and when the better men had 
<A NAME="387"></A>dispersed, he gathered round him all the worst spirits.
<A NAME="388"></A><BR><BR>At last, when there were others ready to be abettors of a mutiny, 
<A NAME="389"></A>he asked, in the tone of a demagogue, why, like slaves, they submitted 
<A NAME="390"></A>to a few centurions and still fewer tribunes. "When," he said, "will you 
<A NAME="391"></A>dare to demand relief, if you do not go with your prayers or arms to a 
<A NAME="392"></A>new and yet tottering throne? We have blundered enough by our tameness 
<A NAME="393"></A>for so many years, in having to endure thirty or forty campaigns till we 
<A NAME="394"></A>grow old, most of us with bodies maimed by wounds. Even dismissal is not 
<A NAME="395"></A>the end of our service, but, quartered under a legion's standard we toil 
<A NAME="396"></A>through the same hardships under another title. If a soldier survives so 
<A NAME="397"></A>many risks, he is still dragged into remote regions where, under the name 
<A NAME="398"></A>of lands, he receives soaking swamps or mountainous wastes. Assuredly, 
<A NAME="399"></A>military service itself is burdensome and unprofitable; ten as a day is 
<A NAME="400"></A>the value set on life and limb; out of this, clothing, arms, tents, as 
<A NAME="401"></A>well as the mercy of centurions and exemptions from duty have to be purchased. 
<A NAME="402"></A>But indeed of floggings and wounds, of hard winters, wearisome summers, 
<A NAME="403"></A>of terrible war, or barren peace, there is no end. Our only relief can 
<A NAME="404"></A>come from military life being entered on under fixed conditions, from receiving 
<A NAME="405"></A>each the pay of a denarius, and from the sixteenth year terminating our 
<A NAME="406"></A>service. We must be retained no longer under a standard, but in the same 
<A NAME="407"></A>camp a compensation in money must be paid us. Do the praetorian cohorts, 
<A NAME="408"></A>which have just got their two denarii per man, and which after sixteen 
<A NAME="409"></A>years are restored to their homes, encounter more perils? We do not disparage 
<A NAME="410"></A>the guards of the capital; still, here amid barbarous tribes we have to 
<A NAME="411"></A>face the enemy from our tents."
<A NAME="412"></A><BR><BR>The throng applauded from various motives, some pointing with indignation 
<A NAME="413"></A>to the marks of the lash, others to their grey locks, and most of them 
<A NAME="414"></A>to their threadbare garments and naked limbs. At, last, in their fury they 
<A NAME="415"></A>went so far as to propose to combine the three legions into one. Driven 
<A NAME="416"></A>from their purpose by the jealousy with which every one sought the chief 
<A NAME="417"></A>honour for his own legion, they turned to other thoughts, and set up in 
<A NAME="418"></A>one spot the three eagles, with the ensigns of the cohorts. At the same 
<A NAME="419"></A>time they piled up turf and raised a mound, that they might have a more 
<A NAME="420"></A>conspicuous meeting-place. Amid the bustle Blaesus came up. He upbraided 
<A NAME="421"></A>them and held back man after man with the exclamation, "Better imbrue your 
<A NAME="422"></A>hands in my blood: it will be less guilt to slay your commander than it 
<A NAME="423"></A>is to be in revolt from the emperor. Either living I will uphold the loyalty 
<A NAME="424"></A>of the legions, or Pierced to the heart I will hasten on your 
<A NAME="425"></A>repentance."
<A NAME="426"></A><BR><BR>None the less however was the mound piled up, and it was quite 
<A NAME="427"></A>breast high when, at last overcome by his persistency, they gave up their 
<A NAME="428"></A>purpose. Blaesus, with the consummate tact of an orator, said, "It is not 
<A NAME="429"></A>through mutiny and tumult that the desires of the army ought to be communicated 
<A NAME="430"></A>to Caesar, nor did our soldiers of old ever ask so novel a boon of ancient 
<A NAME="431"></A>commanders, nor have you yourselves asked it of the Divine Augustus. It 
<A NAME="432"></A>is far from opportune that the emperor's cares, now in their first beginning, 
<A NAME="433"></A>should be aggravated. If, however, you are bent upon attempting in peace 
<A NAME="434"></A>what even after your victory in the civil wars you did not demand, why, 
<A NAME="435"></A>contrary to the habit of obedience, contrary to the law of discipline, 
<A NAME="436"></A>do you meditate violence? Decide on sending envoys, and give them instructions 
<A NAME="437"></A>in your presence."
<A NAME="438"></A><BR><BR>It was carried by acclamation that the son of Blaesus, one of the 
<A NAME="439"></A>tribunes, should undertake the mission, and demand for the soldiers release 
<A NAME="440"></A>from service after sixteen years. He was to have the rest of their message 
<A NAME="441"></A>when the first part had been successful. After the young man departure 
<A NAME="442"></A>there was comparative quiet, but there was an arrogant tone among the soldiers, 
<A NAME="443"></A>to whom the fact that their commander's son was pleading their common cause 
<A NAME="444"></A>clearly showed that they had wrested by compulsion what they had failed 
<A NAME="445"></A>to obtain by good behaviour.
<A NAME="446"></A><BR><BR>Meanwhile the companies which previous to the mutiny had been sent 
<A NAME="447"></A>to Nauportus to make roads and bridges and for other purposes, when they 
<A NAME="448"></A>heard of the tumult in the camp, tore up the standards, and having plundered 
<A NAME="449"></A>the neighbouring villages and Nauportus itself, which was like a town, 
<A NAME="450"></A>assailed the centurions who restrained them with jeers and insults, last 
<A NAME="451"></A>of all, with blows. Their chief rage was against Aufidienus Rufus, the 
<A NAME="452"></A>camp-prefect, whom they dragged from a waggon, loaded with baggage, and 
<A NAME="453"></A>drove on at the head of the column, asking him in ridicule whether he liked 
<A NAME="454"></A>to bear such huge burdens and such long marches. Rufus, who had long been 
<A NAME="455"></A>a common soldier, then a centurion, and subsequently camp-prefect, tried 
<A NAME="456"></A>to revive the old severe discipline, inured as he was to work and toil, 
<A NAME="457"></A>and all the sterner because he had endured.
<A NAME="458"></A><BR><BR>On the arrival of these troops the mutiny broke out afresh, and 
<A NAME="459"></A>straggling from the camp they plundered the neighbourhood. Blaesus ordered 
<A NAME="460"></A>a few who had conspicuously loaded themselves with spoil to be scourged 
<A NAME="461"></A>and imprisoned as a terror to the rest; for, even as it then was, the commander 
<A NAME="462"></A>was still obeyed by the centurions and by all the best men among the soldiers. 
<A NAME="463"></A>As the men were dragged off, they struggled violently, clasped the knees 
<A NAME="464"></A>of the bystanders, called to their comrades by name, or to the company, 
<A NAME="465"></A>cohort, or legion to which they respectively belonged, exclaiming that 
<A NAME="466"></A>all were threatened with the same fate. At the same time they heaped abuse 
<A NAME="467"></A>on the commander; they appealed to heaven and to the gods, and left nothing 
<A NAME="468"></A>undone by which they might excite resentment and pity, alarm and rage. 
<A NAME="469"></A>They all rushed to the spot, broke open the guardhouse, unbound the prisoners, 
<A NAME="470"></A>and were in a moment fraternising with deserters and men convicted on capital 
<A NAME="471"></A>charges.
<A NAME="472"></A><BR><BR>Thence arose a more furious outbreak, with more leaders of the 
<A NAME="473"></A>mutiny. Vibulenus, a common soldier, was hoisted in front of the general's 
<A NAME="474"></A>tribunal on the shoulders of the bystanders and addressed the excited throng, 
<A NAME="475"></A>who eagerly awaited his intentions. "You have indeed," he said, "restored 
<A NAME="476"></A>light and air to these innocent and most unhappy men, but who restores 
<A NAME="477"></A>to my brother his life, or my brother to myself? Sent to you by the German 
<A NAME="478"></A>army in our common cause, he was last night butchered by the gladiators 
<A NAME="479"></A>whom the general keeps and arms for the destruction of his soldiers. Answer, 
<A NAME="480"></A>Blaesus, where you have flung aside the corpse? Even an enemy grudges not 
<A NAME="481"></A>burial. When, with embraces and tears, I have sated my grief, order me 
<A NAME="482"></A>also to be slain, provided only that when we have been destroyed for no 
<A NAME="483"></A>crime, but only because we consulted the good of the legions, we may be 
<A NAME="484"></A>buried by these men around me."
<A NAME="485"></A><BR><BR>He inflamed their excitement by weeping and smiting his breast 
<A NAME="486"></A>and face with his hands. Then, hurling aside those who bore him on their 
<A NAME="487"></A>shoulders, and impetuously flinging himself at the feet of one man after 
<A NAME="488"></A>another, he roused such dismay and indignation that some of the soldiers 
<A NAME="489"></A>put fetters on the gladiators who were among the number of Blaesus's slaves, 
<A NAME="490"></A>others did the like to the rest of his household, while a third party hurried 
<A NAME="491"></A>out to look for the corpse. And had it not quickly been known that no corpse 
<A NAME="492"></A>was found, that the slaves, when tortures were applied, denied the murder, 
<A NAME="493"></A>and that the man never had a brother, they would have been on the point 
<A NAME="494"></A>of destroying the general. As it was, they thrust out the tribunes and 
<A NAME="495"></A>the camp-prefect; they plundered the baggage of the fugitives, and they 
<A NAME="496"></A>killed a centurion, Lucilius, to whom, with soldiers' humour, they had 
<A NAME="497"></A>given the name "Bring another," because when he had broken one vine-stick 
<A NAME="498"></A>on a man's back, he would call in a loud voice for another and another. 
<A NAME="499"></A>The rest sheltered themselves in concealment, and one only was detained, 
<A NAME="500"></A>Clemens Julius, whom the soldiers considered a fit person to carry messages, 
<A NAME="501"></A>from his ready wit. Two legions, the eighth and the fifteenth, were actually 
<A NAME="502"></A>drawing swords against each other, the former demanding the death of a 
<A NAME="503"></A>centurion, whom they nicknamed Sirpicus, while the men of the fifteenth 
<A NAME="504"></A>defended him, but the soldiers of the ninth interposed their entreaties, 
<A NAME="505"></A>and when these were disregarded, their menaces.
<A NAME="506"></A><BR><BR>This intelligence had such an effect on Tiberius, close as he was, 
<A NAME="507"></A>and most careful to hush up every very serious disaster, that he despatched 
<A NAME="508"></A>his son Drusus with the leading men of the State and with two praetorian 
<A NAME="509"></A>cohorts, without any definite instructions, to take suitable measures. 
<A NAME="510"></A>The cohorts were strengthened beyond their usual force with some picked 
<A NAME="511"></A>troops. There was in addition a considerable part of the Praetorian cavalry, 
<A NAME="512"></A>and the flower of the German soldiery, which was then the emperor's guard. 
<A NAME="513"></A>With them too was the commander of the praetorians, Aelius Sejanus, who 
<A NAME="514"></A>had been associated with his own father, Strabo, had great influence with 
<A NAME="515"></A>Tiberius, and was to advise and direct the young prince, and to hold out 
<A NAME="516"></A>punishment or reward to the soldiers. When Drusus approached, the legions, 
<A NAME="517"></A>as a mark of respect, met him, not as usual, with glad looks or the glitter 
<A NAME="518"></A>of military decorations, but in unsightly squalor, and faces which, though 
<A NAME="519"></A>they simulated grief, rather expressed defiance.
<A NAME="520"></A><BR><BR>As soon as he entered the entrenchments, they secured the gates 
<A NAME="521"></A>with sentries, and ordered bodies of armed men to be in readiness at certain 
<A NAME="522"></A>points of the camp. The rest crowded round the general's tribunal in a 
<A NAME="523"></A>dense mass. Drusus stood there, and with a gesture of his hand demanded 
<A NAME="524"></A>silence. As often as they turned their eyes back on the throng, they broke 
<A NAME="525"></A>into savage exclamations, then looking up to Drusus they trembled. There 
<A NAME="526"></A>was a confused hum, a fierce shouting, and a sudden lull. Urged by conflicting 
<A NAME="527"></A>emotions, they felt panic and they caused the like. At last, in an interval 
<A NAME="528"></A>of the uproar, Drusus read his father's letter, in which it was fully stated 
<A NAME="529"></A>that he had a special care for the brave legions with which he had endured 
<A NAME="530"></A>a number of campaigns; that, as soon as his mind had recovered from its 
<A NAME="531"></A>grief, he would lay their demands before the Senators; that meanwhile he 
<A NAME="532"></A>had sent his son to concede unhesitatingly what could be immediately granted, 
<A NAME="533"></A>and that the rest must be reserved for the Senate, which ought to have 
<A NAME="534"></A>a voice in showing either favour or severity.
<A NAME="535"></A><BR><BR>The crowd replied that they had delivered their instructions to 
<A NAME="536"></A>Clemens, one of the centurions, which he was to convey to Rome. He began 
<A NAME="537"></A>to speak of the soldiers' discharge after sixteen years, of the rewards 
<A NAME="538"></A>of completed service, of the daily pay being a denarius, and of the veterans 
<A NAME="539"></A>not being detained under a standard. When Drusus pleaded in answer reference 
<A NAME="540"></A>to the Senate and to his father, he was interrupted by a tumultuous shout. 
<A NAME="541"></A>"Why had he come, neither to increase the soldiers' pay, nor to alleviate 
<A NAME="542"></A>their hardships, in a word, with no power to better their lot? Yet heaven 
<A NAME="543"></A>knew that all were allowed to scourge and to execute. Tiberius used formerly 
<A NAME="544"></A>in the name of Augustus to frustrate the wishes of the legions, and the 
<A NAME="545"></A>same tricks were now revived by Drusus. Was it only sons who were to visit 
<A NAME="546"></A>them? Certainly, it was a new thing for the emperor to refer to the Senate 
<A NAME="547"></A>merely what concerned the soldier's interests. Was then the same Senate 
<A NAME="548"></A>to be consulted whenever notice was given of an execution or of a battle? 
<A NAME="549"></A>Were their rewards to be at the discretion of absolute rulers, their punishments 
<A NAME="550"></A>to be without appeal?"
<A NAME="551"></A><BR><BR>At last they deserted the general's tribunal, and to any praetorian 
<A NAME="552"></A>soldier or friend of Caesar's who met them, they used those threatening 
<A NAME="553"></A>gestures which are the cause of strife and the beginning of a conflict, 
<A NAME="554"></A>with special rage against Cneius Lentulus, because they thought that he 
<A NAME="555"></A>above all others, by his age and warlike renown, encouraged Drusus, and 
<A NAME="556"></A>was the first to scorn such blots on military discipline. Soon after, as 
<A NAME="557"></A>he was leaving with Drusus to betake himself in foresight of his danger 
<A NAME="558"></A>to the winter can they surrounded him, and asked him again and again whither 
<A NAME="559"></A>he was going; was it to the emperor or to the Senate, there also to oppose 
<A NAME="560"></A>the interests of the legions. At the same moment they menaced him savagely 
<A NAME="561"></A>and flung stones. And now, bleeding from a blow, and feeling destruction 
<A NAME="562"></A>certain, he was rescued by the hurried arrival of the throng which had 
<A NAME="563"></A>accompanied Drusus.
<A NAME="564"></A><BR><BR>That terrible night which threatened an explosion of crime was 
<A NAME="565"></A>tranquillised by a mere accident. Suddenly in a clear sky the moon's radiance 
<A NAME="566"></A>seemed to die away. This the soldiers in their ignorance of the cause regarded 
<A NAME="567"></A>as an omen of their condition, comparing the failure of her light to their 
<A NAME="568"></A>own efforts, and imagining that their attempts would end prosperously should 
<A NAME="569"></A>her brightness and splendour be restored to the goddess. And so they raised 
<A NAME="570"></A>a din with brazen instruments and the combined notes of trumpets and horns, 
<A NAME="571"></A>with joy or sorrow, as she brightened or grew dark. When clouds arose and 
<A NAME="572"></A>obstructed their sight, and it was thought she was buried in the gloom, 
<A NAME="573"></A>with that proneness to superstition which steals over minds once thoroughly 
<A NAME="574"></A>cowed, they lamented that this was a portent of never-ending hardship, 
<A NAME="575"></A>and that heaven frowned on their deeds.
<A NAME="576"></A><BR><BR>Drusus, thinking that he ought to avail himself of this change 
<A NAME="577"></A>in their temper and turn what chance had offered to a wise account, ordered 
<A NAME="578"></A>the tents to be visited. Clemens, the centurion was summoned with all others 
<A NAME="579"></A>who for their good qualities were liked by the common soldiers. These men 
<A NAME="580"></A>made their way among the patrols, sentries and guards of the camp-gates, 
<A NAME="581"></A>suggesting hope or holding out threats. "How long will you besiege the 
<A NAME="582"></A>emperor's son? What is to be the end of our strifes? Will Percennius and 
<A NAME="583"></A>Vibulenus give pay to the soldiers and land to those who have earned their 
<A NAME="584"></A>discharge? In a word, are they, instead of the Neros and the Drusi, to 
<A NAME="585"></A>control the empire of the Roman people? Why are we not rather first in 
<A NAME="586"></A>our repentance as we were last in the offence? Demands made in common are 
<A NAME="587"></A>granted slowly; a separate favour you may deserve and receive at the same 
<A NAME="588"></A>moment."
<A NAME="589"></A><BR><BR>With minds affected by these words and growing mutually suspicious, 
<A NAME="590"></A>they divided off the new troops from the old, and one legion from another. 
<A NAME="591"></A>Then by degrees the instinct of obedience returned. They quitted the gates 
<A NAME="592"></A>and restored to their places the standards which at the beginning of the 
<A NAME="593"></A>mutiny they had grouped into one spot.
<A NAME="594"></A><BR><BR>At daybreak Drusus called them to an assembly, and, though not 
<A NAME="595"></A>a practised speaker, yet with natural dignity upbraided them for their 
<A NAME="596"></A>past and commended their present behaviour. He was not, he said, to be 
<A NAME="597"></A>conquered by terror or by threats. Were he to see them inclining to submission 
<A NAME="598"></A>and hear the language of entreaty, he would write to his father, that he 
<A NAME="599"></A>might be merciful and receive the legions' petition. At their prayer, Blaesus 
<A NAME="600"></A>and Lucius Apronius, a Roman knight on Drusus's staff, with Justus Catonius, 
<A NAME="601"></A>a first-rank centurion, were again sent to Tiberius. Then ensued a conflict 
<A NAME="602"></A>of opinion among them, some maintaining that it was best to wait the envoys' 
<A NAME="603"></A>return and meanwhile humour the soldiers, others, that stronger measures 
<A NAME="604"></A>ought to be used, inasmuch as the rabble knows no mean, and inspires fear, 
<A NAME="605"></A>unless they are afraid, though when they have once been overawed, they 
<A NAME="606"></A>can be safely despised. "While superstition still swayed them, the general 
<A NAME="607"></A>should apply terror by removing the leaders of the mutiny."
<A NAME="608"></A><BR><BR>Drusus's temper was inclined to harsh measures. He summoned Vibulenus 
<A NAME="609"></A>and Percennius and ordered them to be put to death. The common account 
<A NAME="610"></A>is that they were buried in the general's tent, though according to some 
<A NAME="611"></A>their bodies were flung outside the entrenchments for all to 
<A NAME="612"></A>see.
<A NAME="613"></A><BR><BR>Search was then made for all the chief mutineers. Some as they 
<A NAME="614"></A>roamed outside the camp were cut down by the centurions or by soldiers 
<A NAME="615"></A>of the praetorian cohorts. Some even the companies gave up in proof of 
<A NAME="616"></A>their loyalty. The men's troubles were increased by an early winter with 
<A NAME="617"></A>continuous storms so violent that they could not go beyond their tents 
<A NAME="618"></A>or meet together or keep the standards in their places, from which they 
<A NAME="619"></A>were perpetually tom by hurricane and rain. And there still lingered the 
<A NAME="620"></A>dread of the divine wrath; nor was it without meaning, they thought, that, 
<A NAME="621"></A>hostile to an impious host, the stars grew dim and storms burst over them. 
<A NAME="622"></A>Their only relief from misery was to quit an ill-omened and polluted camp, 
<A NAME="623"></A>and, having purged themselves of their guilt, to betake themselves again 
<A NAME="624"></A>every one to his winterquarters. First the eighth, then the fifteenth legion 
<A NAME="625"></A>returned; the ninth cried again and again that they ought to wait for the 
<A NAME="626"></A>letter from Tiberius, but soon finding themselves isolated by the departure 
<A NAME="627"></A>of the rest, they voluntarily forestalled their inevitable fate. Drusus, 
<A NAME="628"></A>without awaiting the envoys' return, as for the present all was quiet, 
<A NAME="629"></A>went back to Rome.
<A NAME="630"></A><BR><BR>About the same time, from the same causes, the legions of Germany 
<A NAME="631"></A>rose in mutiny, with a fury proportioned to their greater numbers, in the 
<A NAME="632"></A>confident hope that Germanicus Caesar would not be able to endure another's 
<A NAME="633"></A>supremacy and offer himself to the legions, whose strength would carry 
<A NAME="634"></A>everything before it. There were two armies on the bank of the Rhine; that 
<A NAME="635"></A>named the upper army had Caius Silius for general; the lower was under 
<A NAME="636"></A>the charge of Aulus Caecina. The supreme direction rested with Germanicus, 
<A NAME="637"></A>then busily employed in conducting the assessment of Gaul. The troops under 
<A NAME="638"></A>the control of Silius, with minds yet in suspense, watched the issue of 
<A NAME="639"></A>mutiny elsewhere; but the soldiers of the lower army fell into a frenzy, 
<A NAME="640"></A>which had its beginning in the men of the twenty-first and fifth legions, 
<A NAME="641"></A>and into which the first and twentieth were also drawn. For they were all 
<A NAME="642"></A>quartered in the same summer-camp, in the territory of the Ubii, enjoying 
<A NAME="643"></A>ease or having only light on hearing of the death of Augustus, a rabble 
<A NAME="644"></A>of city slaves, who had been enlisted under a recent levy at Rome, habituated 
<A NAME="645"></A>to laxity and impatient of hardship, filled the ignorant minds of the other 
<A NAME="646"></A>soldiers with notions that the time had come when the veteran might demand 
<A NAME="647"></A>a timely discharge, the young, more liberal pay, all, an end of their miseries, 
<A NAME="648"></A>and vengeance on the cruelty of centurions.
<A NAME="649"></A><BR><BR>It was not one alone who spoke thus, as did Percennius among the 
<A NAME="650"></A>legions of Pannonia, nor was it in the ears of trembling soldiers, who 
<A NAME="651"></A>looked with apprehension to other and mightier armies, but there was sedition 
<A NAME="652"></A>in many a face and voice. "The Roman world," they said, was in their hand; 
<A NAME="653"></A>their victories aggrandised the State; it was from them that emperors received 
<A NAME="654"></A>their titles."
<A NAME="655"></A><BR><BR>Nor did their commander check them. Indeed, the blind rage of so 
<A NAME="656"></A>many had robbed him of his resolution., In a sudden frenzy they rushed 
<A NAME="657"></A>with drawn swords on the centurions, the immemorial object of the soldiers' 
<A NAME="658"></A>resentment and the first cause of savage fury. They threw them to the earth 
<A NAME="659"></A>and beat them sorely, sixty to one, so as to correspond with the number 
<A NAME="660"></A>of centurions. Then tearing them from the ground, mangled, and some lifeless, 
<A NAME="661"></A>they flung them outside the entrenchments or into the river Rhine. One 
<A NAME="662"></A>Septimius, who fled to the tribunal and was grovelling at Caecina's feet, 
<A NAME="663"></A>was persistently demanded till he was given up to destruction. Cassius 
<A NAME="664"></A>Chaerea, who won for himself a memory with posterity by the murder of Caius 
<A NAME="665"></A>Caesar, being then a youth of high spirit, cleared a passage with his sword 
<A NAME="666"></A>through the armed and opposing throng. Neither tribune nor camp-prefect 
<A NAME="667"></A>maintained authority any longer. Patrols, sentries, and whatever else the 
<A NAME="668"></A>needs of the time required, were distributed by the men themselves. To 
<A NAME="669"></A>those who could guess the temper of soldiers with some penetration, the 
<A NAME="670"></A>strongest symptom of a wide-spread and intractable commotion, was the fact 
<A NAME="671"></A>that, instead of being divided or instigated by a few persons, they were 
<A NAME="672"></A>unanimous in their fury and equally unanimous in their composure, with 
<A NAME="673"></A>so uniform a consistency that one would have thought them to be under 
<A NAME="674"></A>command.
<A NAME="675"></A><BR><BR>Meantime Germanicus, while, as I have related, he was collecting 
<A NAME="676"></A>the taxes of Gaul, received news of the death of Augustus. He was married 
<A NAME="677"></A>to the granddaughter of Augustus, Agrippina, by whom he had several children, 
<A NAME="678"></A>and though he was himself the son of Drusus, brother of Tiberius, and grandson 
<A NAME="679"></A>of Augusta, he was troubled by the secret hatred of his uncle and grandmother, 
<A NAME="680"></A>the motives for which were the more venomous because unjust. For the memory 
<A NAME="681"></A>of Drusus was held in honour by the Roman people, and they believed that 
<A NAME="682"></A>had he obtained empire, he would have restored freedom. Hence they regarded 
<A NAME="683"></A>Germanicus with favour and with the same hope. He was indeed a young man 
<A NAME="684"></A>of unaspiring temper, and of wonderful kindliness, contrasting strongly 
<A NAME="685"></A>with the proud and mysterious reserve that marked the conversation and 
<A NAME="686"></A>the features of Tiberius. Then, there were feminine jealousies, Livia feeling 
<A NAME="687"></A>a stepmother's bitterness towards Agrippina, and Agrippina herself too 
<A NAME="688"></A>being rather excitable, only her purity and love of her husband gave a 
<A NAME="689"></A>right direction to her otherwise imperious disposition.
<A NAME="690"></A><BR><BR>But the nearer Germanicus was to the highest hope, the more laboriously 
<A NAME="691"></A>did he exert himself for Tiberius, and he made the neighbouring Sequani 
<A NAME="692"></A>and all the Belgic states swear obedience to him. On hearing of the mutiny 
<A NAME="693"></A>in the legions, he instantly went to the spot, and met them outside the 
<A NAME="694"></A>camp, eyes fixed on the ground, and seemingly repentant. As soon as he 
<A NAME="695"></A>entered the entrenchments, confused murmurs became audible. Some men, seizing 
<A NAME="696"></A>his hand under pretence of kissing it, thrust his fingers into their mouths, 
<A NAME="697"></A>that he might touch their toothless gums; others showed him their limbs 
<A NAME="698"></A>bowed with age. He ordered the throng which stood near him, as it seemed 
<A NAME="699"></A>a promiscuous gathering, to separate itself into its military companies. 
<A NAME="700"></A>They replied that they would hear better as they were. The standards were 
<A NAME="701"></A>then to be advanced, so that thus at least the cohorts might be distinguished. 
<A NAME="702"></A>The soldiers obeyed reluctantly. Then beginning with a reverent mention 
<A NAME="703"></A>of Augustus, he passed on to the victories and triumphs of Tiberius, dwelling 
<A NAME="704"></A>with especial praise on his glorious achievements with those legions in 
<A NAME="705"></A>Germany. Next, he extolled the unity of Italy, the loyalty of Gaul, the 
<A NAME="706"></A>entire absence of turbulence or strife. He was heard in silence or with 
<A NAME="707"></A>but a slight murmur.
<A NAME="708"></A><BR><BR>As soon as he touched on the mutiny and asked what had become of 
<A NAME="709"></A>soldierly obedience, of the glory of ancient discipline, whither they had 
<A NAME="710"></A>driven their tribunes and centurions, they all bared their bodies and taunted 
<A NAME="711"></A>him with the scars of their wounds and the marks of the lash. And then 
<A NAME="712"></A>with confused exclamations they spoke bitterly of the prices of exemptions, 
<A NAME="713"></A>of their scanty pay, of the severity of their tasks, with special mention 
<A NAME="714"></A>of the entrenchment, the fosse, the conveyance of fodder, building-timber, 
<A NAME="715"></A>firewood, and whatever else had to be procured from necessity, or as a 
<A NAME="716"></A>check on idleness in the camp. The fiercest clamour arose from the veteran 
<A NAME="717"></A>soldiers, who, as they counted their thirty campaigns or more, implored 
<A NAME="718"></A>him to relieve worn-out men, and not let them die under the same hardships, 
<A NAME="719"></A>but have an end of such harassing service, and repose without beggary. 
<A NAME="720"></A>Some even claimed the legacy of the Divine Augustus, with words of good 
<A NAME="721"></A>omen for Germanicus, and, should he wish for empire, they showed themselves 
<A NAME="722"></A>abundantly willing. Thereupon, as though he were contracting the pollution 
<A NAME="723"></A>of guilt, he leapt impetuously from the tribunal. The men opposed his departure 
<A NAME="724"></A>with their weapons, threatening him repeatedly if he would not go back. 
<A NAME="725"></A>But Germanicus protesting that he would die rather than cast off his loyalty, 
<A NAME="726"></A>plucked his sword from his side, raised it aloft and was plunging it into 
<A NAME="727"></A>his breast, when those nearest him seized his hand and held it by force. 
<A NAME="728"></A>The remotest and most densely crowded part of the throng, and, what almost 
<A NAME="729"></A>passes belief, some, who came close up to him, urged him to strike the 
<A NAME="730"></A>blow, and a soldier, by name Calusidius, offered him a drawn sword, saying 
<A NAME="731"></A>that it was sharper than his own. Even in their fury, this seemed to them 
<A NAME="732"></A>a savage act and one of evil precedent, and there was a pause during which 
<A NAME="733"></A>Caesar's friends hurried him into his tent.
<A NAME="734"></A><BR><BR>There they took counsel how to heal matters. For news was also 
<A NAME="735"></A>brought that the soldiers were preparing the despatch of envoys who were 
<A NAME="736"></A>to draw the upper army into their cause; that the capital of the Ubii was 
<A NAME="737"></A>marked out for destruction, and that hands with the stain of plunder on 
<A NAME="738"></A>them would soon be daring enough for the pillage of Gaul. The alarm was 
<A NAME="739"></A>heightened by the knowledge that the enemy was aware of the Roman mutiny, 
<A NAME="740"></A>and would certainly attack if the Rhine bank were undefended. Yet if the 
<A NAME="741"></A>auxiliary troops and allies were to be armed against the retiring legions, 
<A NAME="742"></A>civil war was in fact begun. Severity would be dangerous; profuse liberality 
<A NAME="743"></A>would be scandalous. Whether all or nothing were conceded to the soldiery, 
<A NAME="744"></A>the State was equally in jeopardy.
<A NAME="745"></A><BR><BR>Accordingly, having weighed their plans one against each other, 
<A NAME="746"></A>they decided that a letter should be written in the prince's name, to the 
<A NAME="747"></A>effect that full discharge was granted to those who had served in twenty 
<A NAME="748"></A>campaigns; that there was a conditional release for those who had served 
<A NAME="749"></A>sixteen, and that they were to be retained under a standard with immunity 
<A NAME="750"></A>from everything except actually keeping off the enemy; that the legacies 
<A NAME="751"></A>which they had asked, were to be paid and doubled.
<A NAME="752"></A><BR><BR>The soldiers perceived that all this was invented for the occasion, 
<A NAME="753"></A>and instantly pressed their demands. The discharge from service was quickly 
<A NAME="754"></A>arranged by the tribunes. Payment was put off till they reached their respective 
<A NAME="755"></A>winterquarters. The men of the fifth and twenty-first legions refused to 
<A NAME="756"></A>go till in the summer-camp where they stood the money was made up out of 
<A NAME="757"></A>the purses of Germanicus himself and his friends, and paid in full. The 
<A NAME="758"></A>first and twentieth legions were led back by their officer Caecina to the 
<A NAME="759"></A>canton of the Ubii, marching in disgrace, since sums of money which had 
<A NAME="760"></A>been extorted from the general were carried among the eagles and standards. 
<A NAME="761"></A>Germanicus went to the Upper Army, and the second, thirteenth, and sixteenth 
<A NAME="762"></A>legions, without any delay, accepted from him the oath of allegiance. The 
<A NAME="763"></A>fourteenth hesitated a little, but their money and the discharge were offered 
<A NAME="764"></A>even without their demanding it.
<A NAME="765"></A><BR><BR>Meanwhile there was an outbreak among the Chauci, begun by some 
<A NAME="766"></A>veterans of the mutinous legions on garrison duty. They were quelled for 
<A NAME="767"></A>a time by the instant execution of two soldiers. Such was the order of 
<A NAME="768"></A>Mennius, the camp-prefect, more as a salutary warning than as a legal act. 
<A NAME="769"></A>Then, when the commotion increased, he fled and having been discovered, 
<A NAME="770"></A>as his hiding place was now unsafe, he borrowed a resource from audacity. 
<A NAME="771"></A>"It was not," he told them, "the camp-prefect, it was Germanicus, their 
<A NAME="772"></A>general, it was Tiberius, their emperor, whom they were insulting." At 
<A NAME="773"></A>the same moment, overawing all resistance, he seized the standard, faced 
<A NAME="774"></A>round towards the river-bank, and exclaiming that whoever left the ranks, 
<A NAME="775"></A>he would hold as a deserter, he led them back into their winter-quarters, 
<A NAME="776"></A>disaffected indeed, but cowed.
<A NAME="777"></A><BR><BR>Meanwhile envoys from the Senate had an interview with Germanicus, 
<A NAME="778"></A>who had now returned, at the Altar of the Ubii. Two legions, the first 
<A NAME="779"></A>and twentieth, with veterans discharged and serving under a standard, were 
<A NAME="780"></A>there in winter-quarters. In the bewilderment of terror and conscious guilt 
<A NAME="781"></A>they were penetrated by an apprehension that persons had come at the Senate's 
<A NAME="782"></A>orders to cancel the concessions they had extorted by mutiny. And as it 
<A NAME="783"></A>is the way with a mob to fix any charge, however groundless, on some particular 
<A NAME="784"></A>person, they reproached Manatius Plancus, an ex-consul and the chief envoy, 
<A NAME="785"></A>with being the author of the Senate's decree. At midnight they began to 
<A NAME="786"></A>demand the imperial standard kept in Germanicus's quarters, and having 
<A NAME="787"></A>rushed together to the entrance, burst the door, dragged Caesar from his 
<A NAME="788"></A>bed, and forced him by menaces of death to give up the standard. Then roaming 
<A NAME="789"></A>through the camp-streets, they met the envoys, who on hearing of the tumult 
<A NAME="790"></A>were hastening to Germanicus. They loaded them with insults, and were on 
<A NAME="791"></A>the point of murdering them, Plancus especially, whose high rank had deterred 
<A NAME="792"></A>him from flight. In his peril he found safety only in the camp of the first 
<A NAME="793"></A>legion. There clasping the standards and the eagle, he sought to protect 
<A NAME="794"></A>himself under their sanctity. And had not the eagle-bearer, Calpurnius, 
<A NAME="795"></A>saved him from the worst violence, the blood of an envoy of the Roman people, 
<A NAME="796"></A>an occurrence rare even among our foes, would in a Roman camp have stained 
<A NAME="797"></A>the altars of the gods.
<A NAME="798"></A><BR><BR>At last, with the light of day, when the general and the soldiers 
<A NAME="799"></A>and the whole affair were clearly recognised, Germanicus entered the camp, 
<A NAME="800"></A>ordered Plancus to be conducted to him, and received him on the tribunal. 
<A NAME="801"></A>He then upbraided them with their fatal infatuation, revived not so much 
<A NAME="802"></A>by the anger of the soldiers as by that of heaven, and explained the reasons 
<A NAME="803"></A>of the envoys' arrival. On the rights of ambassadors, on the dreadful and 
<A NAME="804"></A>undeserved peril of Plancus, and also on the disgrace into which the legion 
<A NAME="805"></A>had brought itself, he dwelt with the eloquence of pity, and while the 
<A NAME="806"></A>throng was confounded rather than appeased, he dismissed the envoys with 
<A NAME="807"></A>an escort of auxiliary cavalry.
<A NAME="808"></A><BR><BR>Amid the alarm all condemned Germanicus for not going to the Upper 
<A NAME="809"></A>Army, where he might find obedience and help against the rebels. "Enough 
<A NAME="810"></A>and more than enough blunders," they said, "had been made by granting discharges 
<A NAME="811"></A>and money, indeed, by conciliatory measures. Even if Germanicus held his 
<A NAME="812"></A>own life cheap, why should he keep a little son and a pregnant wife among 
<A NAME="813"></A>madmen who outraged every human right? Let these, at least, be restored 
<A NAME="814"></A>safely to their grandsire and to the State."
<A NAME="815"></A><BR><BR>When his wife spurned the notion, protesting that she was a descendant 
<A NAME="816"></A>of the Divine Augustus and could face peril with no degenerate spirit, 
<A NAME="817"></A>he at last embraced her and the son of their love with many tears, and 
<A NAME="818"></A>after long delay compelled her to depart. Slowly moved along a pitiable 
<A NAME="819"></A>procession of women, a general's fugitive wife with a little son in her 
<A NAME="820"></A>bosom, her friends' wives weeping round her, as with her they were dragging 
<A NAME="821"></A>themselves from the camp. Not less sorrowful were those who 
<A NAME="822"></A>remained.
<A NAME="823"></A><BR><BR>There was no appearance of the triumphant general about Germanicus, 
<A NAME="824"></A>and he seemed to be in a conquered city rather than in his own camp, while 
<A NAME="825"></A>groans and wailings attracted the ears and looks even of the soldiers. 
<A NAME="826"></A>They came out of their tents, asking "what was that mournful sound? What 
<A NAME="827"></A>meant the sad sight? Here were ladies of rank, not a centurion to escort 
<A NAME="828"></A>them, not a soldier, no sign of a prince's wife, none of the usual retinue. 
<A NAME="829"></A>Could they be going to the Treveri, to be subjects of the foreigner?" Then 
<A NAME="830"></A>they felt shame and pity, and remembered his father Agrippa, her grandfather 
<A NAME="831"></A>Augustus, her father-in-law Drusus, her own glory as a mother of children, 
<A NAME="832"></A>her noble purity. And there was her little child too, born in the camp, 
<A NAME="833"></A>brought up amid the tents of the legions, whom they used to call in soldiers' 
<A NAME="834"></A>fashion, Caligula, because he often wore the shoe so called, to win the 
<A NAME="835"></A>men's goodwill. But nothing moved them so much as jealousy towards the 
<A NAME="836"></A>Treveri. They entreated, stopped the way, that Agrippina might return and 
<A NAME="837"></A>remain, some running to meet her, while most of them went back to Germanicus. 
<A NAME="838"></A>He, with a grief and anger that were yet fresh, thus began to address the 
<A NAME="839"></A>throng around him-
<A NAME="840"></A><BR><BR>"Neither wife nor son are dearer to me than my father and the State. 
<A NAME="841"></A>But he will surely have the protection of his own majesty, the empire of 
<A NAME="842"></A>Rome that of our other armies. My wife and children whom, were it a question 
<A NAME="843"></A>of your glory, I would willingly expose to destruction, I now remove to 
<A NAME="844"></A>a distance from your fury, so that whatever wickedness is thereby threatened, 
<A NAME="845"></A>may be expiated by my blood only, and that you may not be made more guilty 
<A NAME="846"></A>by the slaughter of a great-grandson of Augustus, and the murder of a daughter-in-law 
<A NAME="847"></A>of Tiberius. For what have you not dared, what have you not profaned during 
<A NAME="848"></A>these days? What name shall I give to this gathering? Am I to call you 
<A NAME="849"></A>soldiers, you who have beset with entrenchments and arms your general's 
<A NAME="850"></A>son, or citizens, when you have trampled under foot the authority of the 
<A NAME="851"></A>Senate? Even the rights of public enemies, the sacred character of the 
<A NAME="852"></A>ambassador, and the law of nations have been violated by you. The Divine 
<A NAME="853"></A>Julius once quelled an army's mutiny with a single word by calling those 
<A NAME="854"></A>who were renouncing their military obedience 'citizens.' The Divine Augustus 
<A NAME="855"></A>cowed the legions who had fought at Actium with one look of his face. Though 
<A NAME="856"></A>I am not yet what they were, still, descended as I am from them, it would 
<A NAME="857"></A>be a strange and unworthy thing should I be spurned by the soldiery of 
<A NAME="858"></A>Spain or Syria. First and twentieth legions, you who received your standards 
<A NAME="859"></A>from Tiberius, you, men of the twentieth who have shared with me so many 
<A NAME="860"></A>battles and have been enriched with so many rewards, is not this a fine 
<A NAME="861"></A>gratitude with which you are repaying your general? Are these the tidings 
<A NAME="862"></A>which I shall have to carry to my father when he hears only joyful intelligence 
<A NAME="863"></A>from our other provinces, that his own recruits, his own veterans are not 
<A NAME="864"></A>satisfied with discharge or pay; that here only centurions are murdered, 
<A NAME="865"></A>tribunes driven away, envoys imprisoned, camps and rivers stained with 
<A NAME="866"></A>blood, while I am myself dragging on a precarious existence amid those 
<A NAME="867"></A>who hate me?
<A NAME="868"></A><BR><BR>"Why, on the first day of our meeting, why did you, my friends, 
<A NAME="869"></A>wrest from me, in your blindness, the steel which I was preparing to plunge 
<A NAME="870"></A>into my breast? Better and more loving was the act of the man who offered 
<A NAME="871"></A>me the sword. At any rate I should have perished before I was as yet conscious 
<A NAME="872"></A>of all the disgraces of my army, while you would have chosen a general 
<A NAME="873"></A>who though he might allow my death to pass unpunished would avenge the 
<A NAME="874"></A>death of Varus and his three legions. Never indeed may heaven suffer the 
<A NAME="875"></A>Belgae, though they proffer their aid, to have the glory and honour of 
<A NAME="876"></A>having rescued the name of Rome and quelled the tribes of Germany. It is 
<A NAME="877"></A>thy spirit, Divine Augustus, now received into heaven, thine image, father 
<A NAME="878"></A>Drusus, and the remembrance of thee, which, with these same soldiers who 
<A NAME="879"></A>are now stimulated by shame and ambition, should wipe out this blot and 
<A NAME="880"></A>turn the wrath of civil strife to the destruction of the foe. You too, 
<A NAME="881"></A>in whose faces and in whose hearts I perceive a change, if only you restore 
<A NAME="882"></A>to the Senate their envoys, to the emperor his due allegiance, to myself 
<A NAME="883"></A>my wife and son, do you stand aloof from pollution and separate the mutinous 
<A NAME="884"></A>from among you. This will be a pledge of your repentance, a guarantee of 
<A NAME="885"></A>your loyalty."
<A NAME="886"></A><BR><BR>Thereupon, as suppliants confessing that his reproaches were true, 
<A NAME="887"></A>they implored him to punish the guilty, pardon those who had erred, and 
<A NAME="888"></A>lead them against the enemy. And he was to recall his wife, to let the 
<A NAME="889"></A>nursling of the legions return and not be handed over as a hostage to the 
<A NAME="890"></A>Gauls. As to Agrippina's return, he made the excuse of her approaching 
<A NAME="891"></A>confinement and of winter. His son, he said, would come, and the rest they 
<A NAME="892"></A>might settle themselves. Away they hurried hither and thither, altered 
<A NAME="893"></A>men, and dragged the chief mutineers in chains to Caius Caetronius commander 
<A NAME="894"></A>of the first legion, who tried and punished them one by one in the following 
<A NAME="895"></A>fashion. In front of the throng stood the legions with drawn swords. Each 
<A NAME="896"></A>accused man was on a raised platform and was pointed out by a tribune. 
<A NAME="897"></A>If they shouted out that he was guilty, he was thrown headlong and cut 
<A NAME="898"></A>to pieces. The soldiers gloated over the bloodshed as though it gave them 
<A NAME="899"></A>absolution. Nor did Caesar check them, seeing that without any order from 
<A NAME="900"></A>himself the same men were responsible for all the cruelty and all the odium 
<A NAME="901"></A>of the deed.
<A NAME="902"></A><BR><BR>The example was followed by the veterans, who were soon afterwards 
<A NAME="903"></A>sent into Raetia, nominally to defend the province against a threatened 
<A NAME="904"></A>invasion of the Suevi but really that they might tear themselves from a 
<A NAME="905"></A>camp stamped with the horror of a dreadful remedy no less than with the 
<A NAME="906"></A>memory of guilt. Then the general revised the list of centurions. Each, 
<A NAME="907"></A>at his summons, stated his name, his rank, his birthplace, the number of 
<A NAME="908"></A>his campaigns, what brave deeds he had done in battle, his military rewards, 
<A NAME="909"></A>if any. If the tribunes and the legion commended his energy and good behaviour, 
<A NAME="910"></A>he retained his rank; where they unanimously charged him with rapacity 
<A NAME="911"></A>or cruelty, he was dismissed the service.
<A NAME="912"></A><BR><BR>Quiet being thus restored for the present, a no less formidable 
<A NAME="913"></A>difficulty remained through the turbulence of the fifth and twenty-first 
<A NAME="914"></A>legions, who were in winter quarters sixty miles away at Old Camp, as the 
<A NAME="915"></A>place was called. These, in fact, had been the first to begin the mutiny, 
<A NAME="916"></A>and the most atrocious deeds had been committed by their hands. Unawed 
<A NAME="917"></A>by the punishment of their comrades, and unmoved by their contrition, they 
<A NAME="918"></A>still retained their resentment. Caesar accordingly proposed to send an 
<A NAME="919"></A>armed fleet with some of our allies down the Rhine, resolved to make war 
<A NAME="920"></A>on them should they reject his authority.
<A NAME="921"></A><BR><BR>At Rome, meanwhile, when the result of affairs in Illyrium was 
<A NAME="922"></A>not yet known, and men had heard of the commotion among the German legions, 
<A NAME="923"></A>the citizens in alarm reproached Tiberius for the hypocritical irresolution 
<A NAME="924"></A>with which he was befooling the senate and the people, feeble and disarmed 
<A NAME="925"></A>as they were, while the soldiery were all the time in revolt, and could 
<A NAME="926"></A>not be quelled by the yet imperfectly-matured authority of two striplings. 
<A NAME="927"></A>"He ought to have gone himself and confronted with his imperial majesty 
<A NAME="928"></A>those who would have soon yielded, when they once saw a sovereign of long 
<A NAME="929"></A>experience, who was the supreme dispenser of rigour or of bounty. Could 
<A NAME="930"></A>Augustus, with the feebleness of age on him, so often visit Germany, and 
<A NAME="931"></A>is Tiberius, in the vigour of life, to sit in the Senate and criticise 
<A NAME="932"></A>its members' words? He had taken good care that there should be slavery 
<A NAME="933"></A>at Rome; he should now apply some soothing medicine to the spirit of soldiers, 
<A NAME="934"></A>that they might be willing to endure peace."
<A NAME="935"></A><BR><BR>Notwithstanding these remonstrances, it was the inflexible purpose 
<A NAME="936"></A>of Tiberius not to quit the head-quarters of empire or to imperil himself 
<A NAME="937"></A>and the State. Indeed, many conflicting thoughts troubled him. The army 
<A NAME="938"></A>in Germany was the stronger; that in Pannonia the nearer; the first was 
<A NAME="939"></A>supported by all the strength of Gaul; the latter menaced Italy. Which 
<A NAME="940"></A>was he to prefer, without the fear that those whom he slighted would be 
<A NAME="941"></A>infuriated by the affront? But his sons might alike visit both, and not 
<A NAME="942"></A>compromise the imperial dignity, which inspired the greatest awe at a distance. 
<A NAME="943"></A>There was also an excuse for mere youths referring some matters to their 
<A NAME="944"></A>father, with the possibility that he could conciliate or crush those who 
<A NAME="945"></A>resisted Germanicus or Drusus. What resource remained, if they despised 
<A NAME="946"></A>the emperor? However, as if on the eve of departure, he selected his attendants, 
<A NAME="947"></A>provided his camp-equipage, and prepared a fleet; then winter and matters 
<A NAME="948"></A>of business were the various pretexts with which he amused, first, sensible 
<A NAME="949"></A>men, then the populace, last, and longest of all, the 
<A NAME="950"></A>provinces.
<A NAME="951"></A><BR><BR>Germanicus meantime, though he had concentrated his army and prepared 
<A NAME="952"></A>vengeance against the mutineers, thought that he ought still to allow them 
<A NAME="953"></A>an interval, in case they might, with the late warning before them, regard 
<A NAME="954"></A>their safety. He sent a despatch to Caecina, which said that he was on 
<A NAME="955"></A>the way with a strong force, and that, unless they forestalled his arrival 
<A NAME="956"></A>by the execution of the guilty, he would resort to an indiscriminate massacre. 
<A NAME="957"></A>Caecina read the letter confidentially to the eagle and standardbearers, 
<A NAME="958"></A>and to all in the camp who were least tainted by disloyalty, and urged 
<A NAME="959"></A>them to save the whole army from disgrace, and themselves from destruction. 
<A NAME="960"></A>"In peace," he said, "the merits of a man's case are carefully weighed; 
<A NAME="961"></A>when war bursts on us, innocent and guilty alike perish."
<A NAME="962"></A><BR><BR>Upon this, they sounded those whom they thought best for their 
<A NAME="963"></A>purpose, and when they saw that a majority of their legions remained loyal, 
<A NAME="964"></A>at the commander's suggestion they fixed a time for falling with the sword 
<A NAME="965"></A>on all the vilest and foremost of the mutineers. Then, at a mutually given 
<A NAME="966"></A>signal, they rushed into the tents, and butchered the unsuspecting men, 
<A NAME="967"></A>none but those in the secret knowing what was the beginning or what was 
<A NAME="968"></A>to be the end of the slaughter.
<A NAME="969"></A><BR><BR>The scene was a contrast to all civil wars which have ever occurred. 
<A NAME="970"></A>It was not in battle, it was not from opposing camps, it was from those 
<A NAME="971"></A>same dwellings where day saw them at their common meals, night resting 
<A NAME="972"></A>from labour, that they divided themselves into two factions, and showered 
<A NAME="973"></A>on each other their missiles. Uproar, wounds, bloodshed, were everywhere 
<A NAME="974"></A>visible; the cause was a mystery. All else was at the disposal of chance. 
<A NAME="975"></A>Even some loyal men were slain, for, on its being once understood who were 
<A NAME="976"></A>the objects of fury, some of the worst mutineers too had seized on weapons. 
<A NAME="977"></A>Neither commander nor tribune was present to control them; the men were 
<A NAME="978"></A>allowed license and vengeance to their heart's content. Soon afterwards 
<A NAME="979"></A>Germanicus entered the camp, and exclaiming with a flood of tears, that 
<A NAME="980"></A>this was destruction rather than remedy, ordered the bodies to be 
<A NAME="981"></A>burnt.
<A NAME="982"></A><BR><BR>Even then their savage spirit was seized with desire to march against 
<A NAME="983"></A>the enemy, as an atonement for their frenzy, and it was felt that the shades 
<A NAME="984"></A>of their fellow-soldiers could be appeased only by exposing such impious 
<A NAME="985"></A>breasts to honourable scars. Caesar followed up the enthusiasm of the men, 
<A NAME="986"></A>and having bridged over the Rhine, he sent across it 12,000 from the legions, 
<A NAME="987"></A>with six-and-twenty allied cohorts, and eight squadrons of cavalry, whose 
<A NAME="988"></A>discipline had been without a stain during the mutiny.
<A NAME="989"></A><BR><BR>There was exultation among the Germans, not far off, as long as 
<A NAME="990"></A>we were detained by the public mourning for the loss of Augustus, and then 
<A NAME="991"></A>by our dissensions. But the Roman general in a forced march, cut through 
<A NAME="992"></A>the Caesian forest and the barrier which had been begun by Tiberius, and 
<A NAME="993"></A>pitched his camp on this barrier, his front and rear being defended by 
<A NAME="994"></A>intrenchments, his flanks by timber barricades. He then penetrated some 
<A NAME="995"></A>forest passes but little known, and, as there were two routes, he deliberated 
<A NAME="996"></A>whether he should pursue the short and ordinary route, or that which was 
<A NAME="997"></A>more difficult unexplored, and consequently unguarded by the enemy. He 
<A NAME="998"></A>chose the longer way, and hurried on every remaining preparation, for his 
<A NAME="999"></A>scouts had brought word that among the Germans it was a night of festivity, 
<A NAME="1000"></A>with games, and one of their grand banquets. Caecina had orders to advance 
<A NAME="1001"></A>with some light cohorts, and to clear away any obstructions from the woods. 
<A NAME="1002"></A>The legions followed at a moderate interval. They were helped by a night 
<A NAME="1003"></A>of bright starlight, reached the villages of the Marsi, and threw their 
<A NAME="1004"></A>pickets round the enemy, who even then were stretched on beds or at their 
<A NAME="1005"></A>tables, without the least fear, or any sentries before their camp, so complete 
<A NAME="1006"></A>was their carelessness and disorder; and of war indeed there was no apprehension. 
<A NAME="1007"></A>Peace it certainly was not- merely the languid and heedless ease of half-intoxicated 
<A NAME="1008"></A>people.
<A NAME="1009"></A><BR><BR>Caesar, to spread devastation widely, divided his eager legions 
<A NAME="1010"></A>into four columns, and ravaged a space of fifty miles with fire and sword. 
<A NAME="1011"></A>Neither sex nor age moved his compassion. Everything, sacred or profane, 
<A NAME="1012"></A>the temple too of Tamfana, as they called it, the special resort of all 
<A NAME="1013"></A>those tribes, was levelled to the ground. There was not a wound among our 
<A NAME="1014"></A>soldiers, who cut down a half-asleep, an unarmed, or a straggling foe. 
<A NAME="1015"></A>The Bructeri, Tubantes, and Usipetes, were roused by this slaughter, and 
<A NAME="1016"></A>they beset the forest passes through which the army had to return. The 
<A NAME="1017"></A>general knew this, and he marched, prepared both to advance and to fight. 
<A NAME="1018"></A>Part of the cavalry, and some of the auxiliary cohorts led the van; then 
<A NAME="1019"></A>came the first legion, and, with the baggage in the centre, the men of 
<A NAME="1020"></A>the twenty-first closed up the left, those of the fifth, the right flank. 
<A NAME="1021"></A>The twentieth legion secured the rear, and, next, were the rest of the 
<A NAME="1022"></A>allies.
<A NAME="1023"></A><BR><BR>Meanwhile the enemy moved not till the army began to defile in 
<A NAME="1024"></A>column through the woods, then made slight skirmishing attacks on its flanks 
<A NAME="1025"></A>and van, and with his whole force charged the rear. The light cohorts were 
<A NAME="1026"></A>thrown into confusion by the dense masses of the Germans, when Caesar rode 
<A NAME="1027"></A>up to the men of the twentieth legion, and in a loud voice exclaimed that 
<A NAME="1028"></A>this was the time for wiping out the mutiny. "Advance," he said, "and hasten 
<A NAME="1029"></A>to turn your guilt into glory." This fired their courage, and at a single 
<A NAME="1030"></A>dash they broke through the enemy, and drove him back with great slaughter 
<A NAME="1031"></A>into the open country. At the same moment the troops of the van emerged 
<A NAME="1032"></A>from the woods and intrenched a camp. After this their march was uninterrupted, 
<A NAME="1033"></A>and the soldiery, with the confidence of recent success, and forgetful 
<A NAME="1034"></A>of the past, were placed in winter-quarters.
<A NAME="1035"></A><BR><BR>The news was a source of joy and also of anxiety to Tiberius. He 
<A NAME="1036"></A>rejoiced that the mutiny was crushed, but the fact that Germanicus had 
<A NAME="1037"></A>won the soldiers' favour by lavishing money, and promptly granting the 
<A NAME="1038"></A>discharge, as well as his fame as a soldier, annoyed him. Still, he brought 
<A NAME="1039"></A>his achievements under the notice of the Senate, and spoke much of his 
<A NAME="1040"></A>greatness in language elaborated for effect, more so than could be believed 
<A NAME="1041"></A>to come from his inmost heart. He bestowed a briefer praise on Drusus, 
<A NAME="1042"></A>and on the termination of the disturbance in Illyricum, but he was more 
<A NAME="1043"></A>earnest, and his speech more hearty. And he confirmed, too, in the armies 
<A NAME="1044"></A>of Pannonia all the concessions of Germanicus.
<A NAME="1045"></A><BR><BR>That same year Julia ended her days. For her profligacy she had 
<A NAME="1046"></A>formerly been confined by her father Augustus in the island of Pandateria, 
<A NAME="1047"></A>and then in the town of the Regini on the shores of the straits of Sicily. 
<A NAME="1048"></A>She had been the wife of Tiberius while Caius and Lucius Caesar were in 
<A NAME="1049"></A>their glory, and had disdained him as an unequal match. This was Tiberius's 
<A NAME="1050"></A>special reason for retiring to Rhodes. When he obtained the empire, he 
<A NAME="1051"></A>left her in banishment and disgrace, deprived of all hope after the murder 
<A NAME="1052"></A>of Postumus Agrippa, and let her perish by a lingering death of destitution, 
<A NAME="1053"></A>with the idea that an obscurity would hang over her end from the length 
<A NAME="1054"></A>of her exile. He had a like motive for cruel vengeance on Sempronius Gracchus, 
<A NAME="1055"></A>a man of noble family, of shrewd understanding, and a perverse eloquence, 
<A NAME="1056"></A>who had seduced this same Julia when she was the wife of Marcus Agrippa. 
<A NAME="1057"></A>And this was not the end of the intrigue. When she had been handed over 
<A NAME="1058"></A>to Tiberius, her persistent paramour inflamed her with disobedience and 
<A NAME="1059"></A>hatred towards her husband; and a letter which Julia wrote to her father, 
<A NAME="1060"></A>Augustus, inveighing against Tiberius, was supposed to be the composition 
<A NAME="1061"></A>of Gracchus. He was accordingly banished to Cercina, where he endured an 
<A NAME="1062"></A>exile of fourteen years. Then the soldiers who were sent to slay him, found 
<A NAME="1063"></A>him on a promontory, expecting no good. On their arrival, he begged a brief 
<A NAME="1064"></A>interval in which to give by letter his last instructions to his wife Alliaria, 
<A NAME="1065"></A>and then offered his neck to the executioners, dying with a courage not 
<A NAME="1066"></A>unworthy of the Sempronian name, which his degenerate life had dishonoured. 
<A NAME="1067"></A>Some have related that these soldiers were not sent from Rome, but by Lucius 
<A NAME="1068"></A>Asprenas, proconsul of Africa, on the authority of Tiberius, who had vainly 
<A NAME="1069"></A>hoped that the infamy of the murder might be shifted on 
<A NAME="1070"></A>Asprenas.
<A NAME="1071"></A><BR><BR>The same year witnessed the establishment of religious ceremonies 
<A NAME="1072"></A>in a new priesthood of the brotherhood of the Augustales, just as in former 
<A NAME="1073"></A>days Titus Tatius, to retain the rites of the Sabines, had instituted the 
<A NAME="1074"></A>Titian brotherhood. Twenty-one were chosen by lot from the chief men of 
<A NAME="1075"></A>the State; Tiberius, Drusus, Claudius, and Germanicus, were added to the 
<A NAME="1076"></A>number. The Augustal game's which were then inaugurated, were disturbed 
<A NAME="1077"></A>by quarrels arising out of rivalry between the actors. Augustus had shown 
<A NAME="1078"></A>indulgence to the entertainment by way of humouring Maecenas's extravagant 
<A NAME="1079"></A>passion for Bathyllus, nor did he himself dislike such amusements, and 
<A NAME="1080"></A>he thought it citizenlike to mingle in the pleasures of the populace. Very 
<A NAME="1081"></A>different was the tendency of Tiberius's character. But a people
