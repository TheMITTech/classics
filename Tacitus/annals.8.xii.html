<A NAME="start"></A>
<A NAME="10"></A>A.D. 48-54
<A NAME="11"></A><BR><BR>The destruction of Messalina shook the imperial house; for a strife 
<A NAME="12"></A>arose among the freedmen, who should choose a wife for Claudius, impatient 
<A NAME="13"></A>as he was of a single life and submissive to the rule of wives. The ladies 
<A NAME="14"></A>were fired with no less jealousy. Each insisted on her rank, beauty, and 
<A NAME="15"></A>fortune, and pointed to her claims to such a marriage. But the keenest 
<A NAME="16"></A>competition was between Lollia Paulina, the daughter of Marcus Lollius, 
<A NAME="17"></A>an ex-consul, and Julia Agrippina, the daughter of Germanicus. Callistus 
<A NAME="18"></A>favoured the first, Pallas the second. Aelia Paetina however, of the family 
<A NAME="19"></A>of the Tuberones, had the support of Narcissus. The emperor, who inclined 
<A NAME="20"></A>now one way, now another, as he listened to this or that adviser, summoned 
<A NAME="21"></A>the disputants to a conference and bade them express their opinions and 
<A NAME="22"></A>give their reasons.
<A NAME="23"></A><BR><BR>Narcissus dwelt on the marriage of years gone by, on the tie of 
<A NAME="24"></A>offspring, for Paetina was the mother of Antonia, and on the advantage 
<A NAME="25"></A>of excluding a new element from his household, by the return of a wife 
<A NAME="26"></A>to whom he was accustomed, and who would assuredly not look with a stepmother's 
<A NAME="27"></A>animosity on Britannicus and Octavia, who were next in her affections to 
<A NAME="28"></A>her own children. Callistus argued that she was compromised by her long 
<A NAME="29"></A>separation, and that were she to be taken back, she would be supercilious 
<A NAME="30"></A>on the strength of it. It would be far better to introduce Lollia, for, 
<A NAME="31"></A>as she had no children of her own, she would be free from jealousy, and 
<A NAME="32"></A>would take the place of a mother towards her stepchildren.
<A NAME="33"></A><BR><BR>Pallas again selected Agrippina for special commendation because 
<A NAME="34"></A>she would bring with her Germanicus's grandson, who was thoroughly worthy 
<A NAME="35"></A>of imperial rank, the scion of a noble house and a link to unite the descendants 
<A NAME="36"></A>of the Claudian family. He hoped that a woman who was the mother of many 
<A NAME="37"></A>children and still in the freshness of youth, would not carry off the grandeur 
<A NAME="38"></A>of the Caesars to some other house.
<A NAME="39"></A><BR><BR>This advice prevailed, backed up as it was by Agrippina's charms. 
<A NAME="40"></A>On the pretext of her relationship, she paid frequent visits to her uncle, 
<A NAME="41"></A>and so won his heart, that she was preferred to the others, and, though 
<A NAME="42"></A>not yet his wife, already possessed a wife's power. For as soon as she 
<A NAME="43"></A>was sure of her marriage, she began to aim at greater things, and planned 
<A NAME="44"></A>an alliance between Domitius, her son by Cneius Aenobarbus, and Octavia, 
<A NAME="45"></A>the emperor's daughter. This could not be accomplished without a crime, 
<A NAME="46"></A>for the emperor had betrothed Octavia to Lucius Silanus, a young man otherwise 
<A NAME="47"></A>famous, whom he had brought forward as a candidate for popular favour by 
<A NAME="48"></A>the honour of triumphal distinctions and by a magnificent gladiatorial 
<A NAME="49"></A>show. But no difficulty seemed to be presented by the temper of a sovereign 
<A NAME="50"></A>who had neither partialities nor dislikes, but such as were suggested and 
<A NAME="51"></A>dictated to him.
<A NAME="52"></A><BR><BR>Vitellius accordingly, who used the name of censor to screen a 
<A NAME="53"></A>slave's trickeries, and looked forward to new despotisms, already impending, 
<A NAME="54"></A>associated himself in Agrippina's plans, with a view to her favour, and 
<A NAME="55"></A>began to bring charges against Silanus, whose sister, Junia Calvina, a 
<A NAME="56"></A>handsome and lively girl, had shortly before become his daughter-in-law. 
<A NAME="57"></A>Here was a starting point for an accuser. Vitellius put an infamous construction 
<A NAME="58"></A>on the somewhat incautious though not criminal love between the brother 
<A NAME="59"></A>and sister. The emperor listened, for his affection for his daughter inclined 
<A NAME="60"></A>him the more to admit suspicions against his son-in-law. Silanus meanwhile, 
<A NAME="61"></A>who knew nothing of the plot, and happened that year to be praetor, was 
<A NAME="62"></A>suddenly expelled from the Senate by an edict of Vitellius, though the 
<A NAME="63"></A>roll of Senators had been recently reviewed and the lustrum closed. Claudius 
<A NAME="64"></A>at the same time broke off the connection; Silanus was forced to resign 
<A NAME="65"></A>his office, and the one remaining day of his praetorship was conferred 
<A NAME="66"></A>on Eprius Marcellus.
<A NAME="67"></A><BR><BR>In the year of the consulship of Caius Pompeius and Quintus Veranius, 
<A NAME="68"></A>the marriage arranged between Claudius and Agrippina was confirmed both 
<A NAME="69"></A>by popular rumour and by their own illicit love. Still, they did not yet 
<A NAME="70"></A>dare to celebrate the nuptials in due form, for there was no precedent 
<A NAME="71"></A>for the introduction of a niece into an uncle's house. It was positively 
<A NAME="72"></A>incest, and if disregarded, it would, people feared, issue in calamity 
<A NAME="73"></A>to the State. These scruples ceased not till Vitellius undertook the management 
<A NAME="74"></A>of the matter in his own way. He asked the emperor whether he would yield 
<A NAME="75"></A>to the recommendations of the people and to the authority of the Senate. 
<A NAME="76"></A>When Claudius replied that he was one among the citizens and could not 
<A NAME="77"></A>resist their unanimous voice, Vitellius requested him to wait in the palace, 
<A NAME="78"></A>while he himself went to the Senate. Protesting that the supreme interest 
<A NAME="79"></A>of the commonwealth was at stake, he begged to be allowed to speak first, 
<A NAME="80"></A>and then began to urge that the very burdensome labours of the emperor 
<A NAME="81"></A>in a world-wide administration, required assistance, so that, free from 
<A NAME="82"></A>domestic cares, he might consult the public welfare. How again could there 
<A NAME="83"></A>be a more virtuous relief for the mind of an imperial censor than the taking 
<A NAME="84"></A>of a wife to share his prosperity and his troubles, to whom he might intrust 
<A NAME="85"></A>his inmost thoughts and the care of his young children, unused as he was 
<A NAME="86"></A>to luxury and pleasure, and wont from his earliest youth to obey the 
<A NAME="87"></A>laws.
<A NAME="88"></A><BR><BR>Vitellius, having first put forward these arguments in a conciliatory 
<A NAME="89"></A>speech, and met with decided acquiescence from the Senate, began afresh 
<A NAME="90"></A>to point out, that, as they all recommended the emperor's marriage, they 
<A NAME="91"></A>ought to select a lady conspicuous for noble rank and purity, herself too 
<A NAME="92"></A>the mother of children. "It cannot," he said, "be long a question that 
<A NAME="93"></A>Agrippina stands first in nobility of birth. She has given proof too that 
<A NAME="94"></A>she is not barren, and she has suitable moral qualities. It is, again, 
<A NAME="95"></A>a singular advantage to us, due to divine providence, for a widow to be 
<A NAME="96"></A>united to an emperor who has limited himself to his own lawful wives. We 
<A NAME="97"></A>have heard from our fathers, we have ourselves seen that married women 
<A NAME="98"></A>were seized at the caprice of the Caesars. This is quite alien to the propriety 
<A NAME="99"></A>of our day. Rather let a precedent be now set for the taking of a wife 
<A NAME="100"></A>by an emperor. But, it will be said, marriage with a brother's daughter 
<A NAME="101"></A>is with us a novelty. True; but it is common in other countries, and there 
<A NAME="102"></A>is no law to forbid it. Marriages of cousins were long unknown, but after 
<A NAME="103"></A>a time they became frequent. Custom adapts itself to expediency, and this 
<A NAME="104"></A>novelty will hereafter take its place among recognized 
<A NAME="105"></A>usages."
<A NAME="106"></A><BR><BR>There were some who rushed out of the Senate passionately protesting 
<A NAME="107"></A>that if the emperor hesitated, they would use violence. A promiscuous throng 
<A NAME="108"></A>assembled, and kept exclaiming that the same too was the prayer of the 
<A NAME="109"></A>Roman people. Claudius without further delay presented himself in the forum 
<A NAME="110"></A>to their congratulations; then entering the Senate, he asked from them 
<A NAME="111"></A>a decree which should decide that for the future marriages between uncles 
<A NAME="112"></A>and brothers' daughters should be legal. There was, however, found only 
<A NAME="113"></A>one person who desired such a marriage, Alledius Severus, a Roman knight, 
<A NAME="114"></A>who, as many said, was swayed by the influence of Agrippina. Then came 
<A NAME="115"></A>a revolution in the State, and everything was under the control of a woman, 
<A NAME="116"></A>who did not, like Messalina, insult Rome by loose manners. It was a stringent, 
<A NAME="117"></A>and, so to say, masculine despotism; there was sternness and generally 
<A NAME="118"></A>arrogance in public, no sort of immodesty at home, unless it conduced to 
<A NAME="119"></A>power. A boundless greed of wealth was veiled under the pretext that riches 
<A NAME="120"></A>were being accumulated as a prop to the throne.
<A NAME="121"></A><BR><BR>On the day of the marriage Silanus committed suicide, having up 
<A NAME="122"></A>to that time prolonged his hope of life, or else choosing that day to heighten 
<A NAME="123"></A>the popular indignation. His sister, Calvina, was banished from Italy. 
<A NAME="124"></A>Claudius further added that sacrifices after the ordinances of King Tullius, 
<A NAME="125"></A>and atonements were to be offered by the pontiffs in the grove of Diana, 
<A NAME="126"></A>amid general ridicule at the idea devising penalties and propitiations 
<A NAME="127"></A>for incest at such a time. Agrippina, that she might not be conspicuous 
<A NAME="128"></A>only by her evil deeds, procured for Annaeus Seneca a remission of his 
<A NAME="129"></A>exile, and with it the praetorship. She thought this would be universally 
<A NAME="130"></A>welcome, from the celebrity of his attainments, and it was her wish too 
<A NAME="131"></A>for the boyhood of Domitius to be trained under so excellent an instructor, 
<A NAME="132"></A>and for them to have the benefit of his counsels in their designs on the 
<A NAME="133"></A>throne. For Seneca, it was believed, was devoted to Agrippina from a remembrance 
<A NAME="134"></A>of her kindness, and an enemy to Claudius from a bitter sense of 
<A NAME="135"></A>wrong.
<A NAME="136"></A><BR><BR>It was then resolved to delay no longer. Memmius Pollio, the consul-elect, 
<A NAME="137"></A>was induced by great promises to deliver a speech, praying Claudius to 
<A NAME="138"></A>betroth Octavia to Domitius. The match was not unsuitable to the age of 
<A NAME="139"></A>either, and was likely to develop still more important results. Pollio 
<A NAME="140"></A>introduced the motion in much the same language as Vitellius had lately 
<A NAME="141"></A>used. So Octavia was betrothed, and Domitius, besides his previous relationship, 
<A NAME="142"></A>became now the emperor's affianced son-in-law, and an equal of Britannicus, 
<A NAME="143"></A>through the exertions of his mother and the cunning of those who had been 
<A NAME="144"></A>the accusers of Messalina, and feared the vengeance of her 
<A NAME="145"></A>son.
<A NAME="146"></A><BR><BR>About the same time an embassy from the Parthians, which had been 
<A NAME="147"></A>sent, as I have stated, to solicit the return of Meherdates, was introduced 
<A NAME="148"></A>into the Senate, and delivered a message to the following effect:- "They 
<A NAME="149"></A>were not," they said, "unaware of the treaty of alliance, nor did their 
<A NAME="150"></A>coming imply any revolt from the family of the Arsacids; indeed, even the 
<A NAME="151"></A>son of Vonones, Phraates's grandson, was with them in their resistance 
<A NAME="152"></A>to the despotism of Gotarzes, which was alike intolerable to the nobility 
<A NAME="153"></A>and to the people. Already brothers, relatives, and distant kin had been 
<A NAME="154"></A>swept off by murder after murder; wives actually pregnant, and tender children 
<A NAME="155"></A>were added to Gotarzes' victims, while, slothful at home and unsuccessful 
<A NAME="156"></A>in war, he made cruelty a screen for his feebleness. Between the Parthians 
<A NAME="157"></A>and ourselves there was an ancient friendship, founded on a state alliance, 
<A NAME="158"></A>and we ought to support allies who were our rivals in strength, and yet 
<A NAME="159"></A>yielded to us out of respect. Kings' sons were given as hostages, in order 
<A NAME="160"></A>that when Parthia was tired of home rule, it might fall back on the emperor 
<A NAME="161"></A>and the Senate, and receive from them a better sovereign, familiar with 
<A NAME="162"></A>Roman habits."
<A NAME="163"></A><BR><BR>In answer to these and like arguments Claudius began to speak of 
<A NAME="164"></A>the grandeur of Rome and the submissive attitude of the Parthians. He compared 
<A NAME="165"></A>himself to the Divine Augustus, from whom, he reminded them, they had sought 
<A NAME="166"></A>a king, but omitted to mention Tiberius, though he too had sent them sovereigns. 
<A NAME="167"></A>He added some advice for Meherdates, who was present, and told him not 
<A NAME="168"></A>to be thinking of a despot and his slaves, but rather of a ruler among 
<A NAME="169"></A>fellow citizens, and to practise clemency and justice which barbarians 
<A NAME="170"></A>would like the more for being unused to them. Then he turned to the envoys 
<A NAME="171"></A>and bestowed high praise on the young foster-son of Rome, as one whose 
<A NAME="172"></A>self-control had hitherto been exemplary. "Still," he said, "they must 
<A NAME="173"></A>bear with the caprices of kings, and frequent revolutions were bad. Rome, 
<A NAME="174"></A>sated with her glory, had reached such a height that, she wished even foreign 
<A NAME="175"></A>nations to enjoy repose." Upon this Caius Cassius, governor of Syria, was 
<A NAME="176"></A>commissioned to escort the young prince to the bank of the 
<A NAME="177"></A>Euphrates.
<A NAME="178"></A><BR><BR>Cassius was at that time pre-eminent for legal learning. The profession 
<A NAME="179"></A>of the soldier is forgotten in a quiet period, and peace reduces the enterprising 
<A NAME="180"></A>and indolent to an equality. But Cassius, as far as it was possible without 
<A NAME="181"></A>war, revived ancient discipline, kept exercising the legions, in short, 
<A NAME="182"></A>used as much diligence and precaution as if an enemy were threatening him. 
<A NAME="183"></A>This conduct he counted worthy of his ancestors and of the Cassian family 
<A NAME="184"></A>which had won renown even in those countries.
<A NAME="185"></A><BR><BR>He then summoned those at whose suggestion a king had been sought 
<A NAME="186"></A>from Rome, and having encamped at Zeugma where the river was most easily 
<A NAME="187"></A>fordable and awaited the arrival of the chief men of Parthia and of Acbarus, 
<A NAME="188"></A>king of the Arabs, he reminded Meherdates that the impulsive enthusiasm 
<A NAME="189"></A>of barbarians soon flags from delay or even changes into treachery, and 
<A NAME="190"></A>that therefore he should urge on his enterprise. The advice was disregarded 
<A NAME="191"></A>through the perfidy Acbarus, by whom the foolish young prince, who thought 
<A NAME="192"></A>that the highest position merely meant self-indulgence, was detained for 
<A NAME="193"></A>several days in the town of Edessa. Although a certain Carenes pressed 
<A NAME="194"></A>them to come and promised easy success if they hastened their arrival, 
<A NAME="195"></A>they did not make for Mesopotamia, which was close to them, but, by a long 
<A NAME="196"></A>detour, for Armenia, then ill-suited to their movements, as winter was 
<A NAME="197"></A>beginning.
<A NAME="198"></A><BR><BR>As they approached the plains, wearied with the snows and mountains, 
<A NAME="199"></A>they were joined by the forces of Carenes, and having crossed the river 
<A NAME="200"></A>Tigris they traversed the country of the Adiabeni, whose king Izates had 
<A NAME="201"></A>avowedly embraced the alliance of Meherdates, though secretly and in better 
<A NAME="202"></A>faith he inclined to Gotarzes. In their march they captured the city of 
<A NAME="203"></A>Ninos, the most ancient capital of Assyria, and a fortress, historically 
<A NAME="204"></A>famous, as the spot where the last battle between Darius and Alexander 
<A NAME="205"></A>the power of Persia fell. Gotarzes meantime was offering vows to the local 
<A NAME="206"></A>divinities on a mountain called Sambulos, with special worship of Hercules, 
<A NAME="207"></A>who at a stated time bids the priests in a dream equip horses for the chase 
<A NAME="208"></A>and place them near his temple. When the horses have been laden with quivers 
<A NAME="209"></A>full of arrows, they scour the forest and at length return at night with 
<A NAME="210"></A>empty quivers, panting violently. Again the god in a vision of the night 
<A NAME="211"></A>reveals to them the track along which he roamed through the woods, and 
<A NAME="212"></A>everywhere slaughtered beasts are found.
<A NAME="213"></A><BR><BR>Gotarzes, his army not being yet in sufficient force, made the 
<A NAME="214"></A>river Corma a line of defence, and though he was challenged to an engagement 
<A NAME="215"></A>by taunting messages, he contrived delays, shifted his positions and sent 
<A NAME="216"></A>emissaries to corrupt the enemy and bribe them to throw off their allegiance. 
<A NAME="217"></A>Izates of the Adiabeni and then Acbarus of the Arabs deserted with their 
<A NAME="218"></A>troops, with their countrymen's characteristic fickleness, confirming previous 
<A NAME="219"></A>experience, that barbarians prefer to seek a king from Rome than to keep 
<A NAME="220"></A>him. Meherdates, stript of his powerful auxiliaries and suspecting treachery 
<A NAME="221"></A>in the rest, resolved, as his last resource, to risk everything and try 
<A NAME="222"></A>the issue of a battle. Nor did Gotarzes, who was emboldened by the enemy's 
<A NAME="223"></A>diminished strength, refuse the challenge. They fought with terrible courage 
<A NAME="224"></A>and doubtful result, till Carenes, who having beaten down all resistance 
<A NAME="225"></A>had advanced too far, was surprised by a fresh detachment in his rear. 
<A NAME="226"></A>Then Meherdates in despair yielded to promises from Parrhaces, one of his 
<A NAME="227"></A>father's adherents, and was by his treachery delivered in chains to the 
<A NAME="228"></A>conqueror. Gotarzes taunted him with being no kinsman of his or of the 
<A NAME="229"></A>Arsacids, but a foreigner and a Roman, and having cut off his ears, bade 
<A NAME="230"></A>him live, a memorial of his own clemency, and a disgrace to us. After this 
<A NAME="231"></A>Gotarzes fell ill and died, and Vonones, who then ruled the Medes, was 
<A NAME="232"></A>summoned to the throne. He was memorable neither for his good nor bad fortune; 
<A NAME="233"></A>he completed a short and inglorious reign, and then the empire of Parthia 
<A NAME="234"></A>passed to his son Vologeses.
<A NAME="235"></A><BR><BR>Mithridates of Bosporus, meanwhile, who had lost his power and 
<A NAME="236"></A>was a mere outcast, on learning that the Roman general, Didius, and the 
<A NAME="237"></A>main strength of his army had retired, and that Cotys, a young prince without 
<A NAME="238"></A>experience, was left in his new kingdom with a few cohorts under Julius 
<A NAME="239"></A>Aquila, a Roman knight, disdaining both, roused the neighbouring tribes, 
<A NAME="240"></A>and drew deserters to his standard. At last he collected an army, drove 
<A NAME="241"></A>out the king of the Dandaridae, and possessed himself of his dominions. 
<A NAME="242"></A>When this was known, and the invasion of Bosporus was every moment expected, 
<A NAME="243"></A>Aquila and Cotys, seeing that hostilities had been also resumed by Zorsines, 
<A NAME="244"></A>king of the Siraci, distrusted their own strength, and themselves too sought 
<A NAME="245"></A>the friendship of the foreigner by sending envoys to Eunones, who was then 
<A NAME="246"></A>chief of the Adorsi. There was no difficulty about alliance, when they 
<A NAME="247"></A>pointed to the power of Rome in contrast with the rebel Mithridates. It 
<A NAME="248"></A>was accordingly stipulated that Eunones should engage the enemy with his 
<A NAME="249"></A>cavalry, and the Romans undertake the siege of towns.
<A NAME="250"></A><BR><BR>Then the army advanced in regular formation, the Adorsi in the 
<A NAME="251"></A>van and the rear, while the centre was strengthened by the cohorts, and 
<A NAME="252"></A>native troops of Bosporus with Roman arms. Thus the enemy was defeated, 
<A NAME="253"></A>and they reached Soza, a town in Dandarica, which Mithridates had abandoned, 
<A NAME="254"></A>where it was thought expedient to leave a garrison, as the temper of the 
<A NAME="255"></A>people was uncertain. Next they marched on the Siraci, and after crossing 
<A NAME="256"></A>the river Panda besieged the city of Uspe, which stood on high ground, 
<A NAME="257"></A>and had the defence of wall and fosses; only the walls, not being of stone, 
<A NAME="258"></A>but of hurdles and wicker-work with earth between, were too weak to resist 
<A NAME="259"></A>an assault. Towers were raised to a greater height as a means of annoying 
<A NAME="260"></A>the besieged with brands and darts. Had not night stopped the conflict, 
<A NAME="261"></A>the siege would have been begun and finished within one 
<A NAME="262"></A>day.
<A NAME="263"></A><BR><BR>Next day they sent an embassy asking mercy for the freeborn, and 
<A NAME="264"></A>offering ten thousand slaves. As it would have been inhuman to slay the 
<A NAME="265"></A>prisoners, and very difficult to keep them under guard, the conquerors 
<A NAME="266"></A>rejected the offer, preferring that they should perish by the just doom 
<A NAME="267"></A>of war. The signal for massacre was therefore given to the soldiers, who 
<A NAME="268"></A>had mounted the walls by scaling ladders. The destruction of Uspe struck 
<A NAME="269"></A>terror into the rest of the people, who thought safety impossible when 
<A NAME="270"></A>they saw how armies and ramparts, heights and difficult positions, rivers 
<A NAME="271"></A>and cities, alike yielded to their foe. And so Zorsines, having long considered 
<A NAME="272"></A>whether he should still have regard to the fallen fortunes of Mithridates 
<A NAME="273"></A>or to the kingdom of his fathers, and having at last preferred his country's 
<A NAME="274"></A>interests, gave hostages and prostrated himself before the emperor's image, 
<A NAME="275"></A>to the great glory of the Roman army, which all men knew to have come after 
<A NAME="276"></A>a bloodless victory within three days' march of the river Tanais. In their 
<A NAME="277"></A>return however fortune was not equally favourable; some of their vessels, 
<A NAME="278"></A>as they were sailing back, were driven on the shores of the Tauri and cut 
<A NAME="279"></A>off by the barbarians, who slew the commander of a cohort and several 
<A NAME="280"></A>centurions.
<A NAME="281"></A><BR><BR>Meanwhile Mithridates, finding arms an unavailing resource, considered 
<A NAME="282"></A>on whose mercy he was to throw himself. He feared his brother Cotys, who 
<A NAME="283"></A>had once been a traitor, then become his open enemy. No Roman was on the 
<A NAME="284"></A>spot of authority sufficient to make his promises highly valued. So he 
<A NAME="285"></A>turned to Eunones, who had no personal animosity against him, and had been 
<A NAME="286"></A>lately strengthened by his alliance with us. Adapting his dress and expression 
<A NAME="287"></A>of countenance as much as possible to his present condition, he entered 
<A NAME="288"></A>the palace, and throwing himself at the feet of Eunones he exclaimed, "Mithridates, 
<A NAME="289"></A>whom the Romans have sought so many years by land and sea, stands before 
<A NAME="290"></A>you by his own choice. Deal as you please with the descendant of the great 
<A NAME="291"></A>Achaemenes, the only glory of which enemies have not robbed 
<A NAME="292"></A>me."
<A NAME="293"></A><BR><BR>The great name of Mithridates, his reverse, his prayer, full of 
<A NAME="294"></A>dignity, deeply affected Eunones. He raised the suppliant, and commended 
<A NAME="295"></A>him for having chosen the nation of the Adorsi and his own good faith in 
<A NAME="296"></A>suing for mercy. He sent at the same time envoys to Caesar with a letter 
<A NAME="297"></A>to this effect, that friendship between emperors of Rome and sovereigns 
<A NAME="298"></A>of powerful peoples was primarily based on a similarity of fortune, and 
<A NAME="299"></A>that between himself and Claudius there was the tie of a common victory. 
<A NAME="300"></A>Wars had glorious endings, whenever matters were settled by an amnesty. 
<A NAME="301"></A>The conquered Zorsines had on this principle been deprived of nothing. 
<A NAME="302"></A>For Mithridates, as he deserved heavier punishment, he asked neither power 
<A NAME="303"></A>nor dominions, only that he might not be led in triumph, and pay the penalty 
<A NAME="304"></A>of death.
<A NAME="305"></A><BR><BR>Claudius, though merciful to foreign princes, was yet in doubt 
<A NAME="306"></A>whether it were better to receive the captive with a promise of safety 
<A NAME="307"></A>or to claim his surrender by the sword. To this last he was urged by resentment 
<A NAME="308"></A>at his wrongs, and by thirst for vengeance. On the other hand it was argued 
<A NAME="309"></A>that it would be undertaking a war in a country without roads, on a harbourless 
<A NAME="310"></A>sea, against warlike kings and wandering tribes, on a barren soil; that 
<A NAME="311"></A>a weary disgust would come of tardy movements, and perils of precipitancy; 
<A NAME="312"></A>that the glory of victory would be small, while much disgrace would ensue 
<A NAME="313"></A>on defeat. Why should not the emperor seize the offer and spare the exile, 
<A NAME="314"></A>whose punishment would be the greater, the longer he lived in 
<A NAME="315"></A>poverty?
<A NAME="316"></A><BR><BR>Moved by these considerations, Claudius wrote to Eunones that Mithridates 
<A NAME="317"></A>had certainly merited an extreme and exemplary penalty, which he was not 
<A NAME="318"></A>wanting in power to inflict, but it had been the principle of his ancestors 
<A NAME="319"></A>to show as much forbearance to a suppliant as they showed persistence against 
<A NAME="320"></A>a foe. As for triumphs, they were won over nations and kings hitherto 
<A NAME="321"></A>unconquered.
<A NAME="322"></A><BR><BR>After this, Mithridates was given up and brought to Rome by Junius 
<A NAME="323"></A>Cilo, the procurator of Pontus. There in the emperor's presence he was 
<A NAME="324"></A>said to have spoken too proudly for his position, and words uttered by 
<A NAME="325"></A>him to the following effect became the popular talk: "I have not been sent, 
<A NAME="326"></A>but have come back to you; if you do not believe me, let me go and pursue 
<A NAME="327"></A>me." He stood too with fearless countenance when he was exposed to the 
<A NAME="328"></A>people's gaze near the Rostra, under military guard. To Cilo and Aquila 
<A NAME="329"></A>were voted, respectively, the consular and praetorian 
<A NAME="330"></A>decorations.
<A NAME="331"></A><BR><BR>In the same consulship, Agrippina, who was terrible in her hatred 
<A NAME="332"></A>and detested Lollia, for having competed with her for the emperor's hand, 
<A NAME="333"></A>planned an accusation, through an informer who was to tax her with having 
<A NAME="334"></A>consulted astrologers and magicians and the image of the Clarian Apollo, 
<A NAME="335"></A>about the imperial marriage. Upon this, Claudius, without hearing the accused, 
<A NAME="336"></A>first reminded the Senate of her illustrious rank, that the sister of Lucius 
<A NAME="337"></A>Volusius was her mother, Cotta Messalinus her granduncle, Memmius Regulus 
<A NAME="338"></A>formerly her husband (for of her marriage to Caius Caesar he purposely 
<A NAME="339"></A>said nothing), and then added that she had mischievous designs on the State, 
<A NAME="340"></A>and must have the means of crime taken from her. Consequently, her property 
<A NAME="341"></A>should be confiscated, and she herself banished from Italy. Thus out of 
<A NAME="342"></A>immense wealth only five million sesterces were left to the exile. Calpurnia 
<A NAME="343"></A>too, a lady of high rank, was ruined, simply because the emperor had praised 
<A NAME="344"></A>her beauty in a casual remark, without any passion for her. And so Agrippina's 
<A NAME="345"></A>resentment stopped short of extreme vengeance. A tribune was despatched 
<A NAME="346"></A>to Lollia, who was to force her to suicide. Next on the prosecution of 
<A NAME="347"></A>the Bithynians, Cadius Rufus, was condemned under the law against 
<A NAME="348"></A>extortion.
<A NAME="349"></A><BR><BR>Narbon Gaul, for its special reverence of the Senate, received 
<A NAME="350"></A>a privilege. Senators belonging to the province, without seeking the emperor's 
<A NAME="351"></A>approval, were to be allowed to visit their estates, a right enjoyed by 
<A NAME="352"></A>Sicily. Ituraea and Judaea, on the death of their kings, Sohaemus and Agrippa, 
<A NAME="353"></A>were annexed to the province of Syria.
<A NAME="354"></A><BR><BR>It was also decided that the augury of the public safety, which 
<A NAME="355"></A>for twenty-five years had been neglected, should be revived and henceforth 
<A NAME="356"></A>observed. The emperor likewise widened the sacred precincts of the capital, 
<A NAME="357"></A>in conformity with the ancient usage, according to which, those who had 
<A NAME="358"></A>enlarged the empire were permitted also to extend the boundaries of Rome. 
<A NAME="359"></A>But Roman generals, even after the conquest of great nations, had never 
<A NAME="360"></A>exercised this right, except Lucius Sulla and the Divine 
<A NAME="361"></A>Augustus.
<A NAME="362"></A><BR><BR>There are various popular accounts of the ambitious and vainglorious 
<A NAME="363"></A>efforts of our kings in this matter. Still, I think, it is interesting 
<A NAME="364"></A>to know accurately the original plan of the precinct, as it was fixed by 
<A NAME="365"></A>Romulus. From the ox market, where we see the brazen statue of a bull, 
<A NAME="366"></A>because that animal is yoked to the plough, a furrow was drawn to mark 
<A NAME="367"></A>out the town, so as to embrace the great altar of Hercules; then, at regular 
<A NAME="368"></A>intervals, stones were placed along the foot of the Palatine hill to the 
<A NAME="369"></A>altar of Consus, soon afterwards, to the old Courts, and then to the chapel 
<A NAME="370"></A>of Larunda. The Roman forum and the Capitol were not, it was supposed, 
<A NAME="371"></A>added to the city by Romulus, but by Titus Tatius. In time, the precinct 
<A NAME="372"></A>was enlarged with the growth of Rome's fortunes. The boundaries now fixed 
<A NAME="373"></A>by Claudius may be easily recognized, as they are specified in the public 
<A NAME="374"></A>records.
<A NAME="375"></A><BR><BR>In the consulship of Caius Antistius and Marcus Suilius, the adoption 
<A NAME="376"></A>of Domitius was hastened on by the influence of Pallas. Bound to Agrippina, 
<A NAME="377"></A>first as the promoter of her marriage, then as her paramour, he still urged 
<A NAME="378"></A>Claudius to think of the interests of the State, and to provide some support 
<A NAME="379"></A>for the tender years of Britannicus. "So," he said, "it had been with the 
<A NAME="380"></A>Divine Augustus, whose stepsons, though he had grandsons to be his stay, 
<A NAME="381"></A>had been promoted; Tiberius too, though he had offspring of his own, had 
<A NAME="382"></A>adopted Germanicus. Claudius also would do well to strengthen himself with 
<A NAME="383"></A>a young prince who could share his cares with him."
<A NAME="384"></A><BR><BR>Overcome by these arguments, the emperor preferred Domitius to 
<A NAME="385"></A>his own son, though he was but two years older, and made a speech in the 
<A NAME="386"></A>senate, the same in substance as the representations of his freedman. It 
<A NAME="387"></A>was noted by learned men, that no previous example of adoption into the 
<A NAME="388"></A>patrician family of the Claudii was to be found; and that from Attus Clausus 
<A NAME="389"></A>there had been one unbroken line.
<A NAME="390"></A><BR><BR>However, the emperor received formal thanks, and still more elaborate 
<A NAME="391"></A>flattery was paid to Domitius. A law was passed, adopting him into the 
<A NAME="392"></A>Claudian family with the name of Nero. Agrippina too was honoured with 
<A NAME="393"></A>the title of Augusta. When this had been done, there was not a person so 
<A NAME="394"></A>void of pity as not to feel keen sorrow at the position of Britannicus. 
<A NAME="395"></A>Gradually forsaken by the very slaves who waited on him, he turned into 
<A NAME="396"></A>ridicule the ill-timed attentions of his stepmother, perceiving their insincerity. 
<A NAME="397"></A>For he is said to have had by no means a dull understanding; and this is 
<A NAME="398"></A>either a fact, or perhaps his perils won him sympathy, and so he possessed 
<A NAME="399"></A>the credit of it, without actual evidence.
<A NAME="400"></A><BR><BR>Agrippina, to show her power even to the allied nations, procured 
<A NAME="401"></A>the despatch of a colony of veterans to the chief town of the Ubii, where 
<A NAME="402"></A>she was born. The place was named after her. Agrippa, her grandfather, 
<A NAME="403"></A>had, as it happened, received this tribe, when they crossed the Rhine, 
<A NAME="404"></A>under our protection.
<A NAME="405"></A><BR><BR>During the same time, there was a panic in Upper Germany through 
<A NAME="406"></A>an irruption of plundering bands of Chatti. Thereupon Lucius Pomponius, 
<A NAME="407"></A>who was in command, directed the Vangiones and Nemetes, with the allied 
<A NAME="408"></A>cavalry, to anticipate the raid, and suddenly to fall upon them from every 
<A NAME="409"></A>quarter while they were dispersed. The general's plan was backed up by 
<A NAME="410"></A>the energy of the troops. These were divided into two columns; and those 
<A NAME="411"></A>who marched to the left cut off the plunderers, just on their return, after 
<A NAME="412"></A>a riotous enjoyment of their spoil, when they were heavy with sleep. It 
<A NAME="413"></A>added to the men's joy that they had rescued from slavery after forty years 
<A NAME="414"></A>some survivors of the defeat of Varus.
<A NAME="415"></A><BR><BR>The column which took the right-hand and the shorter route, inflicted 
<A NAME="416"></A>greater loss on the enemy who met them, and ventured on a battle. With 
<A NAME="417"></A>much spoil and glory they returned to Mount Taunus, where Pomponius was 
<A NAME="418"></A>waiting with the legions, to see whether the Chatti, in their eagerness 
<A NAME="419"></A>for vengeance, would give him a chance of fighting. They however fearing 
<A NAME="420"></A>to be hemmed in on one side by the Romans, on the other by the Cherusci, 
<A NAME="421"></A>with whom they are perpetually at feud, sent envoys and hostages to Rome. 
<A NAME="422"></A>To Pomponius was decreed the honour of a triumph; a mere fraction of his 
<A NAME="423"></A>renown with the next generation, with whom his poems constitute his chief 
<A NAME="424"></A>glory.
<A NAME="425"></A><BR><BR>At this same time, Vannius, whom Drusus Caesar had made king of 
<A NAME="426"></A>the Suevi, was driven from his kingdom. In the commencement of his reign 
<A NAME="427"></A>he was renowned and popular with his countrymen; but subsequently, with 
<A NAME="428"></A>long possession, he became a tyrant, and the enmity of neighbours, joined 
<A NAME="429"></A>to intestine strife, was his ruin. Vibillius, king of the Hermunduri, and 
<A NAME="430"></A>Vangio and Sido, sons of a sister of Vannius, led the movement. Claudius, 
<A NAME="431"></A>though often entreated, declined to interpose by arms in the conflict of 
<A NAME="432"></A>the barbarians, and simply promised Vannius a safe refuge in the event 
<A NAME="433"></A>of his expulsion. He wrote instructions to Publius Atellius Hister, governor 
<A NAME="434"></A>of Pannonia, that he was to have his legions, with some picked auxiliaries 
<A NAME="435"></A>from the province itself, encamped on the riverbank, as a support to the 
<A NAME="436"></A>conquered and a terror to the conqueror, who might otherwise, in the elation 
<A NAME="437"></A>of success, disturb also the peace of our empire. For an immense host of 
<A NAME="438"></A>Ligii, with other tribes, was advancing, attracted by the fame of the opulent 
<A NAME="439"></A>realm which Vannius had enriched during thirty years of plunder and of 
<A NAME="440"></A>tribute. Vannius's own native force was infantry, and his cavalry was from 
<A NAME="441"></A>the Iazyges of Sarmatia; an army which was no match for his numerous enemy. 
<A NAME="442"></A>Consequently, he determined to maintain himself in fortified positions, 
<A NAME="443"></A>and protract the war.
<A NAME="444"></A><BR><BR>But the Iazyges, who could not endure a siege, dispersed themselves 
<A NAME="445"></A>throughout the surrounding country and rendered an engagement inevitable, 
<A NAME="446"></A>as the Ligii and Hermunduri had there rushed to the attack. So Vannius 
<A NAME="447"></A>came down out of his fortresses, and though he was defeated in battle, 
<A NAME="448"></A>notwithstanding his reverse, he won some credit by having fought with his 
<A NAME="449"></A>own hand, and received wounds on his breast. He then fled to the fleet 
<A NAME="450"></A>which was awaiting him on the Danube, and was soon followed by his adherents, 
<A NAME="451"></A>who received grants of land and were settled in Pannonia. Vangio and Sido 
<A NAME="452"></A>divided his kingdom between them; they were admirably loyal to us, and 
<A NAME="453"></A>among their subjects, whether the cause was in themselves or in the nature 
<A NAME="454"></A>of despotism, much loved, while seeking to acquire power, and yet more 
<A NAME="455"></A>hated when they had acquired it.
<A NAME="456"></A><BR><BR>Meanwhile, in Britain, Publius Ostorius, the propraetor, found 
<A NAME="457"></A>himself confronted by disturbance. The enemy had burst into the territories 
<A NAME="458"></A>of our allies with all the more fury, as they imagined that a new general 
<A NAME="459"></A>would not march against them with winter beginning and with an army of 
<A NAME="460"></A>which he knew nothing. Ostorius, well aware that first events are those 
<A NAME="461"></A>which produce alarm or confidence, by a rapid movement of his light cohorts, 
<A NAME="462"></A>cut down all who opposed him, pursued those who fled, and lest they should 
<A NAME="463"></A>rally, and so an unquiet and treacherous peace might allow no rest to the 
<A NAME="464"></A>general and his troops, he prepared to disarm all whom he suspected, and 
<A NAME="465"></A>to occupy with encampments the whole country to the Avon and Severn. The 
<A NAME="466"></A>Iceni, a powerful tribe, which war had not weakened, as they had voluntarily 
<A NAME="467"></A>joined our alliance, were the first to resist. At their instigation the 
<A NAME="468"></A>surrounding nations chose as a battlefield a spot walled in by a rude barrier, 
<A NAME="469"></A>with a narrow approach, impenetrable to cavalry. Through these defences 
<A NAME="470"></A>the Roman general, though he had with him only the allied troops, without 
<A NAME="471"></A>the strength of the legions, attempted to break, and having assigned their 
<A NAME="472"></A>positions to his cohorts, he equipped even his cavalry for the work of 
<A NAME="473"></A>infantry. Then at a given signal they forced the barrier, routing the enemy 
<A NAME="474"></A>who were entangled in their own defences. The rebels, conscious of their 
<A NAME="475"></A>guilt, and finding escape barred, performed many noble feats. In this battle, 
<A NAME="476"></A>Marius Ostorius, the general's son, won the reward for saving a citizen's 
<A NAME="477"></A>life.
<A NAME="478"></A><BR><BR>The defeat of the Iceni quieted those who were hesitating between 
<A NAME="479"></A>war and peace. Then the army was marched against the Cangi; their territory 
<A NAME="480"></A>was ravaged, spoil taken everywhere without the enemy venturing on an engagement, 
<A NAME="481"></A>or if they attempted to harass our march by stealthy attacks, their cunning 
<A NAME="482"></A>was always punished. And now Ostorius had advanced within a little distance 
<A NAME="483"></A>of the sea, facing the island Hibernia, when feuds broke out among the 
<A NAME="484"></A>Brigantes and compelled the general's return, for it was his fixed purpose 
<A NAME="485"></A>not to undertake any fresh enterprise till he had consolidated his previous 
<A NAME="486"></A>successes. The Brigantes indeed, when a few who were beginning hostilities 
<A NAME="487"></A>had been slain and the rest pardoned, settled down quietly; but on the 
<A NAME="488"></A>Silures neither terror nor mercy had the least effect; they persisted in 
<A NAME="489"></A>war and could be quelled only by legions encamped in their country. That 
<A NAME="490"></A>this might be the more promptly effected, a colony of a strong body of 
<A NAME="491"></A>veterans was established at Camulodunum on the conquered lands, as a defence 
<A NAME="492"></A>against the rebels, and as a means of imbuing the allies with respect for 
<A NAME="493"></A>our laws.
<A NAME="494"></A><BR><BR>The army then marched against the Silures, a naturally fierce people 
<A NAME="495"></A>and now full of confidence in the might of Caractacus, who by many an indecisive 
<A NAME="496"></A>and many a successful battle had raised himself far above all the other 
<A NAME="497"></A>generals of the Britons. Inferior in military strength, but deriving an 
<A NAME="498"></A>advantage from the deceptiveness of the country, he at once shifted the 
<A NAME="499"></A>war by a stratagem into the territory of the Ordovices, where, joined by 
<A NAME="500"></A>all who dreaded peace with us, he resolved on a final struggle. He selected 
<A NAME="501"></A>a position for the engagement in which advance and retreat alike would 
<A NAME="502"></A>be difficult for our men and comparatively easy for his own, and then on 
<A NAME="503"></A>some lofty hills, wherever their sides could be approached by a gentle 
<A NAME="504"></A>slope, he piled up stones to serve as a rampart. A river too of varying 
<A NAME="505"></A>depth was in his front, and his armed bands were drawn up before his 
<A NAME="506"></A>defences.
<A NAME="507"></A><BR><BR>Then too the chieftains of the several tribes went from rank to 
<A NAME="508"></A>rank, encouraging and confirming the spirit of their men by making light 
<A NAME="509"></A>of their fears, kindling their hopes, and by every other warlike incitement. 
<A NAME="510"></A>As for Caractacus, he flew hither and thither, protesting that that day 
<A NAME="511"></A>and that battle would be the beginning of the recovery of their freedom, 
<A NAME="512"></A>or of everlasting bondage. He appealed, by name, to their forefathers who 
<A NAME="513"></A>had driven back the dictator Caesar, by whose valour they were free from 
<A NAME="514"></A>the Roman axe and tribute, and still preserved inviolate the persons of 
<A NAME="515"></A>their wives and of their children. While he was thus speaking, the host 
<A NAME="516"></A>shouted applause; every warrior bound himself by his national oath not 
<A NAME="517"></A>to shrink from weapons or wounds.
<A NAME="518"></A><BR><BR>Such enthusiasm confounded the Roman general. The river too in 
<A NAME="519"></A>his face, the rampart they had added to it, the frowning hilltops, the 
<A NAME="520"></A>stern resistance and masses of fighting men everywhere apparent, daunted 
<A NAME="521"></A>him. But his soldiers insisted on battle, exclaiming that valour could 
<A NAME="522"></A>overcome all things; and the prefects and tribunes, with similar language, 
<A NAME="523"></A>stimulated the ardour of the troops. Ostorius having ascertained by a survey 
<A NAME="524"></A>the inaccessible and the assailable points of the position, led on his 
<A NAME="525"></A>furious men, and crossed the river without difficulty. When he reached 
<A NAME="526"></A>the barrier, as long as it was a fight with missiles, the wounds and the 
<A NAME="527"></A>slaughter fell chiefly on our soldiers; but when he had formed the military 
<A NAME="528"></A>testudo, and the rude, ill-compacted fence of stones was torn down, and 
<A NAME="529"></A>it was an equal hand-to-hand engagement, the barbarians retired to the 
<A NAME="530"></A>heights. Yet even there, both light and heavy-armed soldiers rushed to 
<A NAME="531"></A>the attack; the first harassed the foe with missiles, while the latter 
<A NAME="532"></A>closed with them, and the opposing ranks of the Britons were broken, destitute 
<A NAME="533"></A>as they were of the defence of breast-plates or helmets. When they faced 
<A NAME="534"></A>the auxiliaries, they were felled by the swords and javelins of our legionaries; 
<A NAME="535"></A>if they wheeled round, they were again met by the sabres and spears of 
<A NAME="536"></A>the auxiliaries. It was a glorious victory; the wife and daughter of Caractacus 
<A NAME="537"></A>were captured, and his brothers too were admitted to 
<A NAME="538"></A>surrender.
<A NAME="539"></A><BR><BR>There is seldom safety for the unfortunate, and Caractacus, seeking 
<A NAME="540"></A>the protection of Cartismandua, queen of the Brigantes, was put in chains 
<A NAME="541"></A>and delivered up to the conquerors, nine years after the beginning of the 
<A NAME="542"></A>war in Britain. His fame had spread thence, and travelled to the neighbouring 
<A NAME="543"></A>islands and provinces, and was actually celebrated in Italy. All were eager 
<A NAME="544"></A>to see the great man, who for so many years had defied our power. Even 
<A NAME="545"></A>at Rome the name of Caractacus was no obscure one; and the emperor, while 
<A NAME="546"></A>he exalted his own glory, enhanced the renown of the vanquished. The people 
<A NAME="547"></A>were summoned as to a grand spectacle; the praetorian cohorts were drawn 
<A NAME="548"></A>up under arms in the plain in front of their camp; then came a procession 
<A NAME="549"></A>of the royal vassals, and the ornaments and neck-chains and the spoils 
<A NAME="550"></A>which the king had won in wars with other tribes, were displayed. Next 
<A NAME="551"></A>were to be seen his brothers, his wife and daughter; last of all, Caractacus 
<A NAME="552"></A>himself. All the rest stooped in their fear to abject supplication; not 
<A NAME="553"></A>so the king, who neither by humble look nor speech sought 
<A NAME="554"></A>compassion.
<A NAME="555"></A><BR><BR>When he was set before the emperor's tribunal, he spoke as follows: 
<A NAME="556"></A>"Had my moderation in prosperity been equal to my noble birth and fortune, 
<A NAME="557"></A>I should have entered this city as your friend rather than as your captive; 
<A NAME="558"></A>and you would not have disdained to receive, under a treaty of peace, a 
<A NAME="559"></A>king descended from illustrious ancestors and ruling many nations. My present 
<A NAME="560"></A>lot is as glorious to you as it is degrading to myself. I had men and horses, 
<A NAME="561"></A>arms and wealth. What wonder if I parted with them reluctantly? If you 
<A NAME="562"></A>Romans choose to lord it over the world, does it follow that the world 
<A NAME="563"></A>is to accept slavery? Were I to have been at once delivered up as a prisoner, 
<A NAME="564"></A>neither my fall nor your triumph would have become famous. My punishment 
<A NAME="565"></A>would be followed by oblivion, whereas, if you save my life, I shall be 
<A NAME="566"></A>an everlasting memorial of your clemency."
<A NAME="567"></A><BR><BR>Upon this the emperor granted pardon to Caractacus, to his wife, 
<A NAME="568"></A>and to his brothers. Released from their bonds, they did homage also to 
<A NAME="569"></A>Agrippina who sat near, conspicuous on another throne, in the same language 
<A NAME="570"></A>of praise and gratitude. It was indeed a novelty, quite alien to ancient 
<A NAME="571"></A>manners, for a woman to sit in front of Roman standards. In fact, Agrippina 
<A NAME="572"></A>boasted that she was herself a partner in the empire which her ancestors 
<A NAME="573"></A>had won.
<A NAME="574"></A><BR><BR>The Senate was then assembled, and speeches were delivered full 
<A NAME="575"></A>of pompous eulogy on the capture of Caractacus. It was as glorious, they 
<A NAME="576"></A>said, as the display of Syphax by Scipio, or of Perses by Lucius Paulus, 
<A NAME="577"></A>or indeed of any captive prince by any of our generals to the people of 
<A NAME="578"></A>Rome. Triumphal distinctions were voted to Ostorius, who thus far had been 
<A NAME="579"></A>successful, but soon afterwards met with reverses; either because, when 
<A NAME="580"></A>Caractacus was out of the way, our discipline was relaxed under an impression 
<A NAME="581"></A>that the war was ended, or because the enemy, out of compassion for so 
<A NAME="582"></A>great a king, was more ardent in his thirst for vengeance. Instantly they 
<A NAME="583"></A>rushed from all parts on the camp-prefect, and legionary cohorts left to 
<A NAME="584"></A>establish fortified positions among the Silures, and had not speedy succour 
<A NAME="585"></A>arrived from towns and fortresses in the neighbourhood, our forces would 
<A NAME="586"></A>then have been totally destroyed. Even as it was, the camp-prefect, with 
<A NAME="587"></A>eight centurions, and the bravest of the soldiers, were slain; and shortly 
<A NAME="588"></A>afterwards, a foraging party of our men, with some cavalry squadrons sent 
<A NAME="589"></A>to their support, was utterly routed.
<A NAME="590"></A><BR><BR>Ostorius then deployed his light cohorts, but even thus he did 
<A NAME="591"></A>not stop the flight, till our legions sustained the brunt of the battle. 
<A NAME="592"></A>Their strength equalized the conflict, which after a while was in our favour. 
<A NAME="593"></A>The enemy fled with trifling loss, as the day was on the decline. Now began 
<A NAME="594"></A>a series of skirmishes, for the most part like raids, in woods and morasses, 
<A NAME="595"></A>with encounters due to chance or to courage, to mere heedlessness or to 
<A NAME="596"></A>calculation, to fury or to lust of plunder, under directions from the officers, 
<A NAME="597"></A>or sometimes even without their knowledge. Conspicuous above all in stubborn 
<A NAME="598"></A>resistance were the Silures, whose rage was fired by words rumoured to 
<A NAME="599"></A>have been spoken by the Roman general, to the effect, that as the Sugambri 
<A NAME="600"></A>had been formerly destroyed or transplanted into Gaul, so the name of the 
<A NAME="601"></A>Silures ought to be blotted out. Accordingly they cut off two of our auxiliary 
<A NAME="602"></A>cohorts, the rapacity of whose officers let them make incautious forays; 
<A NAME="603"></A>and by liberal gifts of spoil and prisoners to the other tribes, they were 
<A NAME="604"></A>luring them too into revolt, when Ostorius, worn out by the burden of his 
<A NAME="605"></A>anxieties, died, to the joy of the enemy, who thought that a campaign at 
<A NAME="606"></A>least, though not a single battle, had proved fatal to general whom none 
<A NAME="607"></A>could despise.
<A NAME="608"></A><BR><BR>The emperor on hearing of the death of his representative appointed 
<A NAME="609"></A>Aulus Didius in his place, that the province might not be left without 
<A NAME="610"></A>a governor. Didius, though he quickly arrived, found matters far from prosperous, 
<A NAME="611"></A>for the legion under the command of Manlius Valens had meanwhile been defeated, 
<A NAME="612"></A>and the disaster had been exaggerated by the enemy to alarm the new general, 
<A NAME="613"></A>while he again magnified it, that he might win the more glory by quelling 
<A NAME="614"></A>the movement or have a fairer excuse if it lasted. This loss too had been 
<A NAME="615"></A>inflicted on us by the Silures, and they were scouring the country far 
<A NAME="616"></A>and wide, till Didius hurried up and dispersed them. After the capture 
<A NAME="617"></A>of Caractacus, Venutius of the Brigantes, as I have already mentioned, 
<A NAME="618"></A>was pre-eminent in military skill; he had long been loyal to Rome and had 
<A NAME="619"></A>been defended by our arms while he was united in marriage to the queen 
<A NAME="620"></A>Cartismandua. Subsequently a quarrel broke out between them, followed instantly 
<A NAME="621"></A>by war, and he then assumed a hostile attitude also towards us. At first, 
<A NAME="622"></A>however, they simply fought against each other, and Cartismandua by cunning 
<A NAME="623"></A>stratagems captured the brothers and kinsfolk of Venutius. This enraged 
<A NAME="624"></A>the enemy, who were stung with shame at the prospect of falling under the 
<A NAME="625"></A>dominion of a woman. The flower of their youth, picked out for war, invaded 
<A NAME="626"></A>her kingdom. This we had foreseen; some cohorts were sent to her aid and 
<A NAME="627"></A>a sharp contest followed, which was at first doubtful but had a satisfactory 
<A NAME="628"></A>termination.
<A NAME="629"></A><BR><BR>The legion under the command of Caesius Nasica fought with a similar 
<A NAME="630"></A>result. For Didius, burdened with years and covered with honours, was content 
<A NAME="631"></A>with acting through his officers and merely holding back the enemy. These 
<A NAME="632"></A>transactions, though occurring under two propraetors, and occupying several 
<A NAME="633"></A>years, I have closely connected, lest, if related separately, they might 
<A NAME="634"></A>be less easily remembered. I now return to the chronological 
<A NAME="635"></A>order.
<A NAME="636"></A><BR><BR>In the fifth consulship of Tiberius Claudius with Sextius Cornelius 
<A NAME="637"></A>Orfitus for his colleague, Nero was prematurely invested with the dress 
<A NAME="638"></A>of manhood, that he might be thought qualified for political life. The 
<A NAME="639"></A>emperor willingly complied with the flatteries of the Senate who wished 
<A NAME="640"></A>Nero to enter on the consulship in his twentieth year, and meanwhile, as 
<A NAME="641"></A>consul-elect, to have pro-consular authority beyond the limits of the capital 
<A NAME="642"></A>with the title of "prince of the youth of Rome." A donative was also given 
<A NAME="643"></A>to the soldiery in Nero's name, and presents to the city populace. At the 
<A NAME="644"></A>games too of the circus which were then being celebrated to win for him 
<A NAME="645"></A>popular favour, Britannicus wore the dress of boyhood, Nero the triumphal 
<A NAME="646"></A>robe, as they rode in the procession. The people would thus behold the 
<A NAME="647"></A>one with the decorations of a general, the other in a boy's habit, and 
<A NAME="648"></A>would accordingly anticipate their respective destinies. At the same time 
<A NAME="649"></A>those of the centurions and tribunes who pitied the lot of Britannicus 
<A NAME="650"></A>were removed, some on false pretexts, others by way of a seeming compliment. 
<A NAME="651"></A>Even of the freedmen, all who were of incorruptible fidelity were discarded 
<A NAME="652"></A>on the following provocation. Once when they met, Nero greeted Britannicus 
<A NAME="653"></A>by that name and was greeted in return as Domitius. Agrippina reported 
<A NAME="654"></A>this to her husband, with bitter complaint, as the beginning of a quarrel, 
<A NAME="655"></A>as implying, in fact, contempt of Nero's adoption and a cancelling at home 
<A NAME="656"></A>of the Senate's decree and the people's vote. She said, too, that, if the 
<A NAME="657"></A>perversity of such malignant suggestions were not checked, it would issue 
<A NAME="658"></A>in the ruin of the State. Claudius, enraged by what he took as a grave 
<A NAME="659"></A>charge, punished with banishment or death all his son's best instructors, 
<A NAME="660"></A>and set persons appointed by his stepmother to have the care of 
<A NAME="661"></A>him.
<A NAME="662"></A><BR><BR>Still Agrippina did not yet dare to attempt her greatest scheme, 
<A NAME="663"></A>unless Lusius Geta and Rufius Crispinus were removed from the command of 
<A NAME="664"></A>the praetorian cohorts; for she thought that they cherished Messalina's 
<A NAME="665"></A>memory and were devoted to her children. Accordingly, as the emperor's 
<A NAME="666"></A>wife persistently affirmed that faction was rife among these cohorts through 
<A NAME="667"></A>the rivalry of the two officers, and that there would be stricter discipline 
<A NAME="668"></A>under one commander, the appointment was transferred to Burrus Afranius, 
<A NAME="669"></A>who had a brilliant reputation as a soldier, but knew well to whose wish 
<A NAME="670"></A>he owed his promotion. Agrippina, too, continued to exalt her own dignity; 
<A NAME="671"></A>she would enter the Capitol in a chariot, a practice, which being allowed 
<A NAME="672"></A>of old only to the priests and sacred images, increased the popular reverence 
<A NAME="673"></A>for a woman who up to this time was the only recorded instance of one who, 
<A NAME="674"></A>an emperor's daughter, was sister, wife, and mother of a sovereign. Meanwhile 
<A NAME="675"></A>her foremost champion, Vitellius, in the full tide of his power and in 
<A NAME="676"></A>extreme age (so uncertain are the fortunes of the great) was attacked by 
<A NAME="677"></A>an accusation of which Junius Lupus, a senator, was the author. He was 
<A NAME="678"></A>charged with treason and designs on the throne. The emperor would have 
<A NAME="679"></A>lent a ready ear, had not Agrippina, by threats rather than entreaties, 
<A NAME="680"></A>induced him to sentence the accuser to outlawry. This was all that Vitellius 
<A NAME="681"></A>desired.
<A NAME="682"></A><BR><BR>Several prodigies occurred in that year. Birds of evil omen perched 
<A NAME="683"></A>on the Capitol; houses were thrown down by frequent shocks of earthquake, 
<A NAME="684"></A>and as the panic spread, all the weak were trodden down in the hurry and 
<A NAME="685"></A>confusion of the crowd. Scanty crops too, and consequent famine were regarded 
<A NAME="686"></A>as a token of calamity. Nor were there merely whispered complaints; while 
<A NAME="687"></A>Claudius was administering justice, the populace crowded round him with 
<A NAME="688"></A>a boisterous clamour and drove him to a corner of the forum, where they 
<A NAME="689"></A>violently pressed on him till he broke through the furious mob with a body 
<A NAME="690"></A>of soldiers. It was ascertained that Rome had provisions for no more than 
<A NAME="691"></A>fifteen days, and it was through the signal bounty of heaven and the mildness 
<A NAME="692"></A>of the winter that its desperate plight was relieved. And yet in past days 
<A NAME="693"></A>Italy used to send supplies for the legions into distant provinces, and 
<A NAME="694"></A>even now it is not a barren soil which causes distress. But we prefer to 
<A NAME="695"></A>cultivate Africa and Egypt, and trust the life of the Roman people to ships 
<A NAME="696"></A>and all their risks.
<A NAME="697"></A><BR><BR>In the same year war broke out between the Armenians and Iberians, 
<A NAME="698"></A>and was the cause of very serious disturbances between Parthia and Rome. 
<A NAME="699"></A>Vologeses was king of the Parthians; on the mother's side, he was the offspring 
<A NAME="700"></A>of a Greek concubine, and he obtained the throne by the retirement of his 
<A NAME="701"></A>brothers. Pharasmanes had been long in possession of Iberia, and his brother, 
<A NAME="702"></A>Mithridates, ruled Armenia with our powerful support. There was a son of 
<A NAME="703"></A>Pharasmanes named Rhadamistus, tall and handsome, of singular bodily strength, 
<A NAME="704"></A>trained in all the accomplishments of his countrymen and highly renowned 
<A NAME="705"></A>among his neighbours. He boasted so arrogantly and persistently that his 
<A NAME="706"></A>father's prolonged old age kept back from him the little kingdom of Iberia 
<A NAME="707"></A>as to make no concealment of his ambition. Pharasmanes accordingly seeing 
<A NAME="708"></A>the young prince had power in his grasp and was strong in the attachment 
<A NAME="709"></A>of his people, fearing too his own declining years, tempted him with other 
<A NAME="710"></A>prospects and pointed to Armenia, which, as he reminded him, he had given 
<A NAME="711"></A>to Mithridates after driving out the Parthians. But open violence, he said, 
<A NAME="712"></A>must be deferred; artful measures, which might crush him unawares, were 
<A NAME="713"></A>better. So Rhadamistus pretended to be at feud with his father as though 
<A NAME="714"></A>his stepmother's hatred was too strong for him, and went to his uncle. 
<A NAME="715"></A>While he was treated by him like a son, with excessive kindness, he lured 
<A NAME="716"></A>the nobles of Armenia into revolutionary schemes, without the knowledge 
<A NAME="717"></A>of Mithridates, who was actually loading him with honours.
<A NAME="718"></A><BR><BR>He then assumed a show of reconciliation with his father, to whom 
<A NAME="719"></A>he returned, telling him all that could be accomplished by treachery was 
<A NAME="720"></A>now ready and that he must complete the affair by the sword. Meanwhile 
<A NAME="721"></A>Pharasmanes invented pretexts for war; when he was fighting with the king 
<A NAME="722"></A>of the Albanians and appealing to the Romans for aid, his brother, he said, 
<A NAME="723"></A>had opposed him, and he would now avenge that wrong by his destruction. 
<A NAME="724"></A>At the same time he gave a large army to his son, who by a sudden invasion 
<A NAME="725"></A>drove Mithridates in terror from the open country and forced him into the 
<A NAME="726"></A>fortress of Gorneas, which was strongly situated and garrisoned by some 
<A NAME="727"></A>soldiers under the command of Caelius Pollio, a camp-prefect, and Casperius, 
<A NAME="728"></A>a centurion.
<A NAME="729"></A><BR><BR>There is nothing of which barbarians are so ignorant as military 
<A NAME="730"></A>engines and the skilful management of sieges, while that is a branch of 
<A NAME="731"></A>military science which we especially understand. And so Rhadamistus having 
<A NAME="732"></A>attempted the fortified walls in vain or with loss, began a blockade, and, 
<A NAME="733"></A>finding that his assaults were despised, tried to bribe the rapacity of 
<A NAME="734"></A>the camp-prefect. Casperius protested earnestly against the overthrow of 
<A NAME="735"></A>an allied king and of Armenia, the gift of the Roman people, through iniquity 
<A NAME="736"></A>and greed of gain. At last, as Pollio pleaded the overpowering numbers 
<A NAME="737"></A>of the enemy and Rhadamistus the orders of his father, the centurion stipulated 
<A NAME="738"></A>for a truce and retired, intending, if he could not deter Pharasmanes from 
<A NAME="739"></A>further hostilities, to inform Ummidius Quadratus, the governor of Syria, 
<A NAME="740"></A>of the state of Armenia.
<A NAME="741"></A><BR><BR>By the centurion's departure the camp prefect was released, so 
<A NAME="742"></A>to say, from surveillance; and he now urged Mithridates to conclude a treaty. 
<A NAME="743"></A>He reminded him of the tie of brotherhood, of the seniority in age of Pharasmanes, 
<A NAME="744"></A>and of their other bonds of kindred, how he was united by marriage to his 
<A NAME="745"></A>brother's daughter, and was himself the father-in-law of Rhadamistus. "The 
<A NAME="746"></A>Iberians," he said, "were not against peace, though for the moment they 
<A NAME="747"></A>were the stronger; the perfidy of the Armenians was notorious, and he had 
<A NAME="748"></A>nothing to fall back on but a fortress without stores; so he must not hesitate 
<A NAME="749"></A>to prefer a bloodless negotiation to arms." As Mithridates wavered, and 
<A NAME="750"></A>suspected the intentions of the camp-prefect, because he had seduced one 
<A NAME="751"></A>of the king's concubines and was reputed a man who could be bribed into 
<A NAME="752"></A>any wickedness, Casperius meantime went to Pharasmanes, and required of 
<A NAME="753"></A>him that the Iberians should raise the blockade. Pharasmanes, to his face, 
<A NAME="754"></A>replied vaguely and often in a conciliatory tone, while by secret messages 
<A NAME="755"></A>he recommended Rhadamistus to hurry on the siege by all possible means. 
<A NAME="756"></A>Then the price of infamy was raised, and Pollio by secret corruption induced 
<A NAME="757"></A>the soldiers to demand peace and to threaten that they would abandon the 
<A NAME="758"></A>garrison. Under this compulsion, Mithridates agreed to a day and a place 
<A NAME="759"></A>for negotiation and quitted the fortress.
<A NAME="760"></A><BR><BR>Rhadamistus at first threw himself into his embraces, feigning 
<A NAME="761"></A>respect and calling him father-in-law and parent. He swore an oath too 
<A NAME="762"></A>that he would do him no violence either by the sword or by poison. At the 
<A NAME="763"></A>same time he drew him into a neighbouring grove, where he assured him that 
<A NAME="764"></A>the appointed sacrifice was prepared for the confirmation of peace in the 
<A NAME="765"></A>presence of the gods. It is a custom of these princes, whenever they join 
<A NAME="766"></A>alliance, to unite their right hands and bind together the thumbs in a 
<A NAME="767"></A>tight knot; then, when the blood has flowed into the extremities, they 
<A NAME="768"></A>let it escape by a slight puncture and suck it in turn. Such a treaty is 
<A NAME="769"></A>thought to have a mysterious sanctity, as being sealed with the blood of 
<A NAME="770"></A>both parties. On this occasion he who was applying the knot pretended that 
<A NAME="771"></A>it had fallen off, and suddenly seizing the knees of Mithridates flung 
<A NAME="772"></A>him to the ground. At the same moment a rush was made by a number of persons, 
<A NAME="773"></A>and chains were thrown round him. Then he was dragged along by a fetter, 
<A NAME="774"></A>an extreme degradation to a barbarian; and soon the common people, whom 
<A NAME="775"></A>he had held under a harsh sway, heaped insults on him with menacing gestures, 
<A NAME="776"></A>though some, on the contrary, pitied such a reverse of fortune. His wife 
<A NAME="777"></A>followed him with his little children, and filled every place with her 
<A NAME="778"></A>wailings. They were hidden away in different covered carriages till the 
<A NAME="779"></A>orders of Pharasmanes were distinctly ascertained. The lust of rule was 
<A NAME="780"></A>more to him than his brother and his daughter, and his heart was steeled 
<A NAME="781"></A>to any wickedness. Still he spared his eyes the seeing them slain before 
<A NAME="782"></A>his face. Rhadamistus too, seemingly mindful of his oath, neither unsheathed 
<A NAME="783"></A>the sword nor used poison against his sister and uncle, but had them thrown 
<A NAME="784"></A>on the ground and then smothered them under a mass of heavy clothes. Even 
<A NAME="785"></A>the sons of Mithridates were butchered for having shed tears over their 
<A NAME="786"></A>parent's murder.
<A NAME="787"></A><BR><BR>Quadratus, learning that Mithridates had been betrayed and that 
<A NAME="788"></A>his kingdom was in the hands of his murderers, summoned a council, and, 
<A NAME="789"></A>having informed them of what had occurred, consulted them whether he should 
<A NAME="790"></A>take vengeance. Few cared for the honour of the State; most argued in favour 
<A NAME="791"></A>of a safe course, saying "that any crime in a foreign country was to be 
<A NAME="792"></A>welcomed with joy, and that the seeds of strife ought to be actually sown, 
<A NAME="793"></A>on the very principle on which Roman emperors had often under a show of 
<A NAME="794"></A>generosity given away this same kingdom of Armenia to excite the minds 
<A NAME="795"></A>of the barbarians. Rhadamistus might retain his ill-gotten gains, as long 
<A NAME="796"></A>as he was hated and infamous; for this was more to Rome's interest than 
<A NAME="797"></A>for him to have succeeded with glory." To this view they assented, but 
<A NAME="798"></A>that they might not be thought to have approved the crime and receive contrary 
<A NAME="799"></A>orders from the emperor, envoys were sent to Pharasmanes, requiring him 
<A NAME="800"></A>to withdraw from Armenian territory and remove his son.
<A NAME="801"></A><BR><BR>Julius Pelignus was then procurator of Cappadocia, a man despised 
<A NAME="802"></A>alike for his feebleness of mind and his grotesque personal appearance. 
<A NAME="803"></A>He was however very intimate with Claudius, who, when in private life, 
<A NAME="804"></A>used to beguile the dullness of his leisure with the society of jesters. 
<A NAME="805"></A>This Pelignus collected some provincial auxiliaries, apparently with the 
<A NAME="806"></A>design of recovering Armenia, but, while he plundered allies instead of 
<A NAME="807"></A>enemies, finding himself, through the desertion of his men and the raids 
<A NAME="808"></A>of the barbarians, utterly defenceless, he went to Rhadamistus, whose gifts 
<A NAME="809"></A>so completely overcame him that he positively encouraged him to assume 
<A NAME="810"></A>the ensigns of royalty, and himself assisted at the ceremony, authorizing 
<A NAME="811"></A>and abetting. When the disgraceful news had spread far and wide, lest the 
<A NAME="812"></A>world might judge of other governors by Pelignus, Helvidius Priscus was 
<A NAME="813"></A>sent in command of a legion to regulate, according to circumstances, the 
<A NAME="814"></A>disordered state of affairs. He quickly crossed Mount Taurus, and had restored 
<A NAME="815"></A>order to a great extent more by moderation than by force, when he was ordered 
<A NAME="816"></A>to return to Syria, that nothing might arise to provoke a war with 
<A NAME="817"></A>Parthia.
<A NAME="818"></A><BR><BR>For Vologeses, thinking that an opportunity presented itself of 
<A NAME="819"></A>invading Armenia, which, though the possession of his ancestors, was now 
<A NAME="820"></A>through a monstrous crime held by a foreign prince, raised an army and 
<A NAME="821"></A>prepared to establish Tiridates on the throne, so that not a member of 
<A NAME="822"></A>his house might be without kingly power. On the advance of the Parthians, 
<A NAME="823"></A>the Iberians dispersed without a battle, and the Armenian cities, Artaxata 
<A NAME="824"></A>and Tigranocerta, submitted to the yoke. Then a frightful winter or deficient 
<A NAME="825"></A>supplies, with pestilence arising from both causes, forced Vologeses to 
<A NAME="826"></A>abandon his present plans. Armenia was thus again without a king, and was 
<A NAME="827"></A>invaded by Rhadamistus, who was now fiercer than ever, looking on the people 
<A NAME="828"></A>as disloyal and sure to rebel on the first opportunity. They however, though 
<A NAME="829"></A>accustomed to be slaves, suddenly threw off their tameness and gathered 
<A NAME="830"></A>round the palace in arms.
<A NAME="831"></A><BR><BR>Rhadamistus had no means of escape but in the swiftness of the 
<A NAME="832"></A>horses which bore him and his wife away. Pregnant as she was, she endured, 
<A NAME="833"></A>somehow or other, out of fear of the enemy and love of her husband, the 
<A NAME="834"></A>first part of the flight, but after a while, when she felt herself shaken 
<A NAME="835"></A>by its continuous speed, she implored to be rescued by an honourable death 
<A NAME="836"></A>from the shame of captivity. He at first embraced, cheered, and encouraged 
<A NAME="837"></A>her, now admiring her heroism, now filled with a sickening apprehension 
<A NAME="838"></A>at the idea of her being left to any man's mercy. Finally, urged by the 
<A NAME="839"></A>intensity of his love and familiarity with dreadful deeds, he unsheathed 
<A NAME="840"></A>his scymitar, and having stabbed her, dragged her to the bank of the Araxes 
<A NAME="841"></A>and committed her to the stream, so that her very body might be swept away. 
<A NAME="842"></A>Then in headlong flight he hurried to Iberia, his ancestral kingdom. Zenobia 
<A NAME="843"></A>meanwhile (this was her name), as she yet breathed and showed signs of 
<A NAME="844"></A>life on the calm water at the river's edge, was perceived by some shepherds, 
<A NAME="845"></A>who inferring from her noble appearance that she was no base-born woman, 
<A NAME="846"></A>bound up her wound and applied to it their rustic remedies. As soon as 
<A NAME="847"></A>they knew her name and her adventure, they conveyed her to the city of 
<A NAME="848"></A>Artaxata, whence she was conducted at the public charge to Tiridates, who 
<A NAME="849"></A>received her kindly and treated her as a royal person.
<A NAME="850"></A><BR><BR>In the consulship of Faustus Sulla and Salvius Otho, Furius Scribonianus 
<A NAME="851"></A>was banished on the ground that he was consulting the astrologers about 
<A NAME="852"></A>the emperor's death. His mother, Junia, was included in the accusation, 
<A NAME="853"></A>as one who still resented the misfortune of exile which she had suffered 
<A NAME="854"></A>in the past. His father, Camillus, had raised an armed insurrection in 
<A NAME="855"></A>Dalmatia, and the emperor in again sparing a hostile family sought the 
<A NAME="856"></A>credit of clemency. But the exile did not live long after this; whether 
<A NAME="857"></A>he was cut off by a natural death, or by poison, was matter of conflicting 
<A NAME="858"></A>rumours, according to people's belief.
<A NAME="859"></A><BR><BR>A decree of the Senate was then passed for the expulsion of the 
<A NAME="860"></A>astrologers from Italy, stringent but ineffectual. Next the emperor, in 
<A NAME="861"></A>a speech, commended all who, from their limited means, voluntarily retired 
<A NAME="862"></A>from the Senatorian order, while those were degraded from it who, by retaining 
<A NAME="863"></A>their seats, added effrontery to poverty.
<A NAME="864"></A><BR><BR>During these proceedings he proposed to the Senate a penalty on 
<A NAME="865"></A>women who united themselves in marriage to slaves, and it was decided that 
<A NAME="866"></A>those who had thus demeaned themselves, without the knowledge of the slave's 
<A NAME="867"></A>master, should be reduced to slavery; if with his consent, should be ranked 
<A NAME="868"></A>as freedwomen. To Pallas, who, as the emperor declared, was the author 
<A NAME="869"></A>of this proposal, were offered on the motion of Barea Soranus, consul-elect, 
<A NAME="870"></A>the decorations of the praetorship and fifteen million sesterces. Cornelius 
<A NAME="871"></A>Scipio added that he deserved public thanks for thinking less of his ancient 
<A NAME="872"></A>nobility as a descendant from the kings of Arcadia, than of the welfare 
<A NAME="873"></A>of the State, and allowing himself to be numbered among the emperor's ministers. 
<A NAME="874"></A>Claudius assured them that Pallas was content with the honour, and that 
<A NAME="875"></A>he limited himself to his former poverty. A decree of the Senate was publicly 
<A NAME="876"></A>inscribed on a bronze tablet, heaping the praises of primitive frugality 
<A NAME="877"></A>on a freedman, the possessor of three hundred million 
<A NAME="878"></A>sesterces.
<A NAME="879"></A><BR><BR>Not equally moderate was his brother, surnamed Felix, who had for 
<A NAME="880"></A>some time been governor of Judaea, and thought that he could do any evil 
<A NAME="881"></A>act with impunity, backed up as he was by such power. It is true that the 
<A NAME="882"></A>Jews had shown symptoms of commotion in a seditious outbreak, and when 
<A NAME="883"></A>they had heard of the assassination of Caius, there was no hearty submission, 
<A NAME="884"></A>as a fear still lingered that any of the emperors might impose the same 
<A NAME="885"></A>orders. Felix meanwhile, by ill-timed remedies, stimulated disloyal acts; 
<A NAME="886"></A>while he had, as a rival in the worst wickedness, Ventidius Cumanus, who 
<A NAME="887"></A>held a part of the province, which was so divided that Galilea was governed 
<A NAME="888"></A>by Cumanus, Samaria by Felix. The two peoples had long been at feud, and 
<A NAME="889"></A>now less than ever restrained their enmity, from contempt of their rulers. 
<A NAME="890"></A>And accordingly they plundered each other, letting loose bands of robbers, 
<A NAME="891"></A>forming ambuscades, and occasionally fighting battles, and carrying the 
<A NAME="892"></A>spoil and booty to the two procurators, who at first rejoiced at all this, 
<A NAME="893"></A>but, as the mischief grew, they interposed with an armed force, which was 
<A NAME="894"></A>cut to pieces. The flame of war would have spread through the province, 
<A NAME="895"></A>but it was saved by Quadratus, governor of Syria. In dealing with the Jews, 
<A NAME="896"></A>who had been daring enough to slay our soldiers, there was little hesitation 
<A NAME="897"></A>about their being capitally punished. Some delay indeed was occasioned 
<A NAME="898"></A>by Cumanus and Felix; for Claudius on hearing the causes of the rebellion 
<A NAME="899"></A>had given authority for deciding also the case of these procurators. Quadratus, 
<A NAME="900"></A>however, exhibited Felix as one of the judges, admitting him to the bench 
<A NAME="901"></A>with the view of cowing the ardour of the prosecutors. And so Cumanus was 
<A NAME="902"></A>condemned for the crimes which the two had committed, and tranquillity 
<A NAME="903"></A>was restored to the province.
<A NAME="904"></A><BR><BR>Not long afterwards some tribes of the wild population of Cilicia, 
<A NAME="905"></A>known as the Clitae, which had often been in commotion, established a camp, 
<A NAME="906"></A>under a leader Troxobor, on their rocky mountains, whence rushing down 
<A NAME="907"></A>on the coast, and on the towns, they dared to do violence to the farmers 
<A NAME="908"></A>and townsfolk, frequently even to the merchants and shipowners. They besieged 
<A NAME="909"></A>the city Anemurium, and routed some troopers sent from Syria to its rescue 
<A NAME="910"></A>under the command of Curtius Severus; for the rough country in the neighbourhood, 
<A NAME="911"></A>suited as it is for the fighting of infantry, did not allow of cavalry 
<A NAME="912"></A>operations. After a time, Antiochus, king of that coast, having broken 
<A NAME="913"></A>the unity of the barbarian forces, by cajolery of the people and treachery 
<A NAME="914"></A>to their leader, slew Troxobor and a few chiefs, and pacified the rest 
<A NAME="915"></A>by gentle measures.
<A NAME="916"></A><BR><BR>About the same time, the mountain between Lake Fucinus and the 
<A NAME="917"></A>river Liris was bored through, and that this grand work might be seen by 
<A NAME="918"></A>a multitude of visitors, preparations were made for a naval battle on the 
<A NAME="919"></A>lake, just as formerly Augustus exhibited such a spectacle, in a basin 
<A NAME="920"></A>he had made this side the Tiber, though with light vessels, and on a smaller 
<A NAME="921"></A>scale. Claudius equipped galleys with three and four banks of oars, and 
<A NAME="922"></A>nineteen thousand men; he lined the circumference of the lake with rafts, 
<A NAME="923"></A>that there might be no means of escape at various points, but he still 
<A NAME="924"></A>left full space for the strength of the crews, the skill of the pilots, 
<A NAME="925"></A>the impact of the vessels, and the usual operations of a seafight. On the 
<A NAME="926"></A>raft stood companies of the praetorian cohorts and cavalry, with a breastwork 
<A NAME="927"></A>in front of them, from which catapults and balistas might be worked. The 
<A NAME="928"></A>rest of the lake was occupied by marines on decked vessels. An immense 
<A NAME="929"></A>multitude from the neighbouring towns, others from Rome itself, eager to 
<A NAME="930"></A>see the sight or to show respect to the emperor, crowded the banks, the 
<A NAME="931"></A>hills, and mountain tops, which thus resembled a theatre. The emperor, 
<A NAME="932"></A>with Agrippina seated near him, presided; he wore a splendid military cloak, 
<A NAME="933"></A>she, a mantle of cloth of gold. A battle was fought with all the courage 
<A NAME="934"></A>of brave men, though it was between condemned criminals. After much bloodshed 
<A NAME="935"></A>they were released from the necessity of mutual slaughter.
<A NAME="936"></A><BR><BR>When the sight was over, the outlet of the water was opened. The 
<A NAME="937"></A>careless execution of the work was apparent, the tunnel not having been 
<A NAME="938"></A>bored down so low as the bottom, or middle of the lake. Consequently after 
<A NAME="939"></A>an interval the excavations were deepened, and to attract a crowd once 
<A NAME="940"></A>more, a show of gladiators was exhibited, with floating pontoons for an 
<A NAME="941"></A>infantry engagement. A banquet too was prepared close to the outflow of 
<A NAME="942"></A>the lake, and it was the means of greatly alarming the whole company, for 
<A NAME="943"></A>the water, in the violence of its outburst, swept away the adjoining parts, 
<A NAME="944"></A>shook the more remote, and spread terror with the tremendous crash. At 
<A NAME="945"></A>the same time, Agrippina availed herself of the emperor's fright to charge 
<A NAME="946"></A>Narcissus, who had been the agent of the work, with avarice and peculation. 
<A NAME="947"></A>He too was not silent, but inveighed against the domineering temper of 
<A NAME="948"></A>her sex, and her extravagant ambition.
<A NAME="949"></A><BR><BR>In the consulship of Didius Junius and Quintus Haterius, Nero, 
<A NAME="950"></A>now sixteen years of age, married Octavia, the emperor's daughter. Anxious 
<A NAME="951"></A>to distinguish himself by noble pursuits, and the reputation of an orator, 
<A NAME="952"></A>he advocated the cause of the people of Ilium, and having eloquently recounted 
<A NAME="953"></A>how Rome was the offspring of Troy, and Aeneas the founder of the Julian 
<A NAME="954"></A>line, with other old traditions akin to myths, he gained for his clients 
<A NAME="955"></A>exemption from all public burdens. His pleading too procured for the colony 
<A NAME="956"></A>of Bononia, which had been ruined by a fire, a subvention of ten million 
<A NAME="957"></A>sesterces. The Rhodians also had their freedom restored to them, which 
<A NAME="958"></A>had often been taken away, or confirmed, according to their services to 
<A NAME="959"></A>us in our foreign wars, or their seditious misdeeds at home. Apamea, too, 
<A NAME="960"></A>which had been shaken by an earthquake, had its tribute remitted for five 
<A NAME="961"></A>years.
<A NAME="962"></A><BR><BR>Claudius, on the other hand, was being prompted to exhibit the 
<A NAME="963"></A>worst cruelty by the artifices of the same Agrippina. On the accusation 
<A NAME="964"></A>of Tarquitius Priscus, she ruined Statilius Taurus, who was famous for 
<A NAME="965"></A>his wealth, and at whose gardens she cast a greedy eye. Priscus had served 
<A NAME="966"></A>under Taurus in his proconsular government of Africa, and after their return 
<A NAME="967"></A>charged him with a few acts of extortion, but particularly with magical 
<A NAME="968"></A>and superstitious practices. Taurus, no longer able to endure a false accusation 
<A NAME="969"></A>and an undeserved humiliation, put a violent end to his life before the 
<A NAME="970"></A>Senate's decision was pronounced. Tarquitius was however expelled from 
<A NAME="971"></A>the Senate, a point which the senators carried, out of hatred for the accuser, 
<A NAME="972"></A>notwithstanding the intrigues of Agrippina.
<A NAME="973"></A><BR><BR>That same year the emperor was often heard to say that the legal 
<A NAME="974"></A>decisions of the commissioners of the imperial treasury ought to have the 
<A NAME="975"></A>same force as if pronounced by himself. Lest it might be supposed that 
<A NAME="976"></A>he had stumbled inadvertently into this opinion, its principle was also 
<A NAME="977"></A>secured by a decree of the Senate on a more complete and ample scale than 
<A NAME="978"></A>before. It had indeed already been arranged by the Divine Augustus that 
<A NAME="979"></A>the Roman knights who governed Egypt should hear causes, and that their 
<A NAME="980"></A>decisions were to be as binding as those of Roman magistrates, and after 
<A NAME="981"></A>a time most of the cases formerly tried by the praetors were submitted 
<A NAME="982"></A>to the knights. Claudius handed over to them the whole administration of 
<A NAME="983"></A>justice for which there had been by sedition or war so many struggles; 
<A NAME="984"></A>the Sempronian laws vesting judicial power in the equestrian order, and 
<A NAME="985"></A>those of Servilius restoring it to the Senate, while it was for this above 
<A NAME="986"></A>everything else that Marius and Sulla fought of old. But those were days 
<A NAME="987"></A>of political conflict between classes, and the results of victory were 
<A NAME="988"></A>binding on the State. Caius Oppius and Cornelius Balbus were the first 
<A NAME="989"></A>who were able, with Caesar's support, to settle conditions of peace and 
<A NAME="990"></A>terms of war. To mention after them the Matii, Vedii, and other too influential 
<A NAME="991"></A>names of Roman knights would be superfluous, when Claudius, we know, raised 
<A NAME="992"></A>freedmen whom he had set over his household to equality with himself and 
<A NAME="993"></A>with the laws.
<A NAME="994"></A><BR><BR>Next the emperor proposed to grant immunity from taxation to the 
<A NAME="995"></A>people of Cos, and he dwelt much on their antiquity. "The Argives or Coeus, 
<A NAME="996"></A>the father of Latona, were the earliest inhabitants of the island; soon 
<A NAME="997"></A>afterwards, by the arrival of Aesculapius, the art of the physician was 
<A NAME="998"></A>introduced and was practised with much fame by his descendants." Claudius 
<A NAME="999"></A>named them one by one, with the periods in which they had respectively 
<A NAME="1000"></A>flourished. He said too that Xenophon, of whose medical skill he availed 
<A NAME="1001"></A>himself, was one of the same family, and that they ought to grant his request 
<A NAME="1002"></A>and let the people of Cos dwell free from all tribute in their sacred island, 
<A NAME="1003"></A>as a place devoted to the sole service of their god. It was also certain 
<A NAME="1004"></A>that many obligations under which they had laid Rome and joint victories 
<A NAME="1005"></A>with her might have been recounted. Claudius however did not seek to veil 
<A NAME="1006"></A>under any external considerations a concession he had made, with his usual 
<A NAME="1007"></A>good nature, to an individual.
<A NAME="1008"></A><BR><BR>Envoys from Byzantium having received audience, in complaining 
<A NAME="1009"></A>to the Senate of their heavy burdens, recapitulated their whole history. 
<A NAME="1010"></A>Beginning with the treaty which they concluded with us when we fought against 
<A NAME="1011"></A>that king of Macedonia whose supposed spurious birth acquired for him the 
<A NAME="1012"></A>name of the Pseudo Philip, they reminded us of the forces which they had 
<A NAME="1013"></A>afterwards sent against Antiochus, Perses and Aristonicus, of the aid they 
<A NAME="1014"></A>had given Antonius in the pirate-war, of their offers to Sulla, Lucullus, 
<A NAME="1015"></A>and Pompeius, and then of their late services to the Caesars, when they 
<A NAME="1016"></A>were in occupation of a district peculiarly convenient for the land or 
<A NAME="1017"></A>sea passage of generals and armies, as well as for the conveyance of 
<A NAME="1018"></A>supplies.
<A NAME="1019"></A><BR><BR>It was indeed on that very narrow strait which parts Europe from 
<A NAME="1020"></A>Asia, at Europe's furthest extremity, that the Greeks built Byzantium. 
<A NAME="1021"></A>When they consulted the Pythian Apollo as to where they should found a 
<A NAME="1022"></A>city, the oracle replied that they were to seek a home opposite to the 
<A NAME="1023"></A>blind men's country. This obscure hint pointed to the people of Chalcedon, 
<A NAME="1024"></A>who, though they arrived there first and saw before others the advantageous 
<A NAME="1025"></A>position, chose the worse. For Byzantium has a fruitful soil and productive 
<A NAME="1026"></A>seas, as immense shoals of fish pour out of the Pontus and are driven by 
<A NAME="1027"></A>the sloping surface of the rocks under water to quit the windings of the 
<A NAME="1028"></A>Asiatic shore and take refuge in these harbours. Consequently the inhabitants 
<A NAME="1029"></A>were at first money-making and wealthy traders, but afterwards, under the 
<A NAME="1030"></A>pressure of excessive burdens, they petitioned for immunity or at least 
<A NAME="1031"></A>relief, and were supported by the emperor, who argued to the Senate that, 
<A NAME="1032"></A>exhausted as they were by the late wars in Thrace and Bosporus, they deserved 
<A NAME="1033"></A>help. So their tribute was remitted for five years.
<A NAME="1034"></A><BR><BR>In the year of the consulship of Marcus Asinius and Manius Acilius 
<A NAME="1035"></A>it was seen to be portended by a succession of prodigies that there were 
<A NAME="1036"></A>to be political changes for the worse. The soldiers' standards and tents 
<A NAME="1037"></A>were set in a blaze by lightning. A swarm of bees settled on the summit 
<A NAME="1038"></A>of the Capitol; births of monsters, half man, half beast, and of a pig 
<A NAME="1039"></A>with a hawk's talons, were reported. It was accounted a portent that every 
<A NAME="1040"></A>order of magistrates had had its number reduced, a quaestor, an aedile, 
<A NAME="1041"></A>a tribune, a praetor and consul having died within a few months. But Agrippina's 
<A NAME="1042"></A>terror was the most conspicuous. Alarmed by some words dropped by Claudius 
<A NAME="1043"></A>when half intoxicated, that it was his destiny to have to endure his wives' 
<A NAME="1044"></A>infamy and at last punish it, she determined to act without a moment's 
<A NAME="1045"></A>delay. First she destroyed Lepida from motives of feminine jealousy. Lepida 
<A NAME="1046"></A>indeed as the daughter of the younger Antonia, as the grandniece of Augustus, 
<A NAME="1047"></A>the cousin of Agrippina, and sister of her husband Cneius, thought herself 
<A NAME="1048"></A>of equally high rank. In beauty, youth, and wealth they differed but slightly. 
<A NAME="1049"></A>Both were shameless, infamous, and intractable, and were rivals in vice 
<A NAME="1050"></A>as much as in the advantages they had derived from fortune. It was indeed 
<A NAME="1051"></A>a desperate contest whether the aunt or the mother should have most power 
<A NAME="1052"></A>over Nero. Lepida tried to win the young prince's heart by flattery and 
<A NAME="1053"></A>lavish liberality, while Agrippina on the other hand, who could give her 
<A NAME="1054"></A>son empire but could not endure that he should be emperor, was fierce and 
<A NAME="1055"></A>full of menace.
<A NAME="1056"></A><BR><BR>It was charged on Lepida that she had made attempts on the Emperor's 
<A NAME="1057"></A>consort by magical incantations, and was disturbing the peace of Italy 
<A NAME="1058"></A>by an imperfect control of her troops of slaves in Calabria. She was for 
<A NAME="1059"></A>this sentenced to death, notwithstanding the vehement opposition of Narcissus, 
<A NAME="1060"></A>who, as he more and more suspected Agrippina, was said to have plainly 
<A NAME="1061"></A>told his intimate friends that "his destruction was certain, whether Britannicus 
<A NAME="1062"></A>or Nero were to be emperor, but that he was under such obligations to Claudius 
<A NAME="1063"></A>that he would sacrifice life to his welfare. Messalina and Silius had been 
<A NAME="1064"></A>convicted, and now again there were similar grounds for accusation. If 
<A NAME="1065"></A>Nero were to rule, or Britannicus succeed to the throne, he would himself 
<A NAME="1066"></A>have no claim on the then reigning sovereign. Meanwhile, a stepmother's 
<A NAME="1067"></A>treacherous schemes were convulsing the whole imperial house, with far 
<A NAME="1068"></A>greater disgrace than would have resulted from his concealment of the profligacy 
<A NAME="1069"></A>of the emperor's former wife. Even as it was, there was shamelessness enough, 
<A NAME="1070"></A>seeing that Pallas was her paramour, so that no one could doubt that she 
<A NAME="1071"></A>held honour, modesty and her very person, everything, in short, cheaper 
<A NAME="1072"></A>than sovereignty."
<A NAME="1073"></A><BR><BR>This, and the like, he was always saying, and he would embrace 
<A NAME="1074"></A>Britannicus, expressing earnest wishes for his speedy arrival at a mature 
<A NAME="1075"></A>age, and would raise his hand, now to heaven, now to the young prince, 
<A NAME="1076"></A>with entreaty that as he grew up, he would drive out his father's enemies 
<A NAME="1077"></A>and also take vengeance on the murderers of his mother.
<A NAME="1078"></A><BR><BR>Under this great burden of anxiety, he had an attack of illness, 
<A NAME="1079"></A>and went to Sinuessa to recruit his strength with its balmy climate and 
<A NAME="1080"></A>salubrious waters. Thereupon, Agrippina, who had long decided on the crime 
<A NAME="1081"></A>and eagerly grasped at the opportunity thus offered, and did not lack instruments, 
<A NAME="1082"></A>deliberated on the nature of the poison to be used. The deed would be betrayed 
<A NAME="1083"></A>by one that was sudden and instantaneous, while if she chose a slow and 
<A NAME="1084"></A>lingering poison, there was a fear that Claudius, when near his end, might, 
<A NAME="1085"></A>on detecting the treachery, return to his love for his son. She decided 
<A NAME="1086"></A>on some rare compound which might derange his mind and delay death. A person 
<A NAME="1087"></A>skilled in such matters was selected, Locusta by name, who had lately been
