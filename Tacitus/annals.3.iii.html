<A NAME="start"></A>
<A NAME="10"></A>A.D. 20-22
<A NAME="11"></A><BR><BR>Without pausing in her winter voyage Agrippina arrived at the island 
<A NAME="12"></A>of Corcyra, facing the shores of Calabria. There she spent a few days to 
<A NAME="13"></A>compose her mind, for she was wild with grief and knew not how to endure. 
<A NAME="14"></A>Meanwhile on hearing of her arrival, all her intimate friends and several 
<A NAME="15"></A>officers, every one indeed who had served under Germanicus, many strangers 
<A NAME="16"></A>too from the neighbouring towns, some thinking it respectful to the emperor, 
<A NAME="17"></A>and still more following their example, thronged eagerly to Brundisium, 
<A NAME="18"></A>the nearest and safest landing place for a voyager.
<A NAME="19"></A><BR><BR>As soon as the fleet was seen on the horizon, not only the harbour 
<A NAME="20"></A>and the adjacent shores, but the city walls too and the roofs and every 
<A NAME="21"></A>place which commanded the most distant prospect were filled with crowds 
<A NAME="22"></A>of mourners, who incessantly asked one another, whether, when she landed, 
<A NAME="23"></A>they were to receive her in silence or with some utterance of emotion. 
<A NAME="24"></A>They were not agreed on what befitted the occasion when the fleet slowly 
<A NAME="25"></A>approached, its crew, not joyous as is usual, but wearing all a studied 
<A NAME="26"></A>expression of grief. When Agrippina descended from the vessel with her 
<A NAME="27"></A>two children, clasping the funeral urn, with eyes riveted to the earth, 
<A NAME="28"></A>there was one universal groan. You could not distinguish kinsfolk from 
<A NAME="29"></A>strangers, or the laments of men from those of women; only the attendants 
<A NAME="30"></A>of Agrippina, worn out as they were by long sorrow, were surpassed by the 
<A NAME="31"></A>mourners who now met them, fresh in their grief.
<A NAME="32"></A><BR><BR>The emperor had despatched two praetorian cohorts with instructions 
<A NAME="33"></A>that the magistrates of Calabria, Apulia, and Campania were to pay the 
<A NAME="34"></A>last honours to his son's memory. Accordingly tribunes and centurions bore 
<A NAME="35"></A>Germanicus's ashes on their shoulders. They were preceded by the standards 
<A NAME="36"></A>unadorned and the faces reversed. As they passed colony after colony, the 
<A NAME="37"></A>populace in black, the knights in their state robes, burnt vestments and 
<A NAME="38"></A>perfumes with other usual funeral adjuncts, in proportion to the wealth 
<A NAME="39"></A>of the place. Even those whose towns were out of the route, met the mourners, 
<A NAME="40"></A>offered victims and built altars to the dead, testifying their grief by 
<A NAME="41"></A>tears and wailings. Drusus went as far as Tarracina with Claudius, brother 
<A NAME="42"></A>of Germanicus, and had been at Rome. Marcus Valerius and Caius Aurelius, 
<A NAME="43"></A>the consuls, who had already entered on office, and a great number of the 
<A NAME="44"></A>people thronged the road in scattered groups, every one weeping as he felt 
<A NAME="45"></A>inclined. Flattery there was none, for all knew that Tiberius could scarcely 
<A NAME="46"></A>dissemble his joy at the death of Germanicus.
<A NAME="47"></A><BR><BR>Tiberius Augusta refrained from showing themselves, thinking it 
<A NAME="48"></A>below their dignity to shed tears in public, or else fearing that, if all 
<A NAME="49"></A>eyes scrutinised their faces, their hypocrisy would be revealed. I do not 
<A NAME="50"></A>find in any historian or in the daily register that Antonia, Germanicus's 
<A NAME="51"></A>mother, rendered any conspicuous honour to the deceased, though besides 
<A NAME="52"></A>Agrippina, Drusus, and Claudius, all his other kinsfolk are mentioned by 
<A NAME="53"></A>name. She may either have been hindered by illness, or with a spirit overpowered 
<A NAME="54"></A>by grief she may not have had the heart to endure the sight of so great 
<A NAME="55"></A>an affliction. But I can more easily believe that Tiberius and Augusta, 
<A NAME="56"></A>who did not leave the palace, kept her within, that their sorrow might 
<A NAME="57"></A>seem equal to hers, and that the grandmother and uncle might be thought 
<A NAME="58"></A>to follow the mother's example in staying at home.
<A NAME="59"></A><BR><BR>The day on which the remains were consigned to the tomb of Augustus, 
<A NAME="60"></A>was now desolate in its silence, now distracted by lamentations. The streets 
<A NAME="61"></A>of the city were crowded; torches were blazing throughout the Campus Martius. 
<A NAME="62"></A>There the soldiers under arms, the magistrates without their symbols of 
<A NAME="63"></A>office, the people in the tribes, were all incessantly exclaiming that 
<A NAME="64"></A>the commonwealth was ruined, that not a hope remained, too boldly and openly 
<A NAME="65"></A>to let one think that they remembered their rulers. But nothing impressed 
<A NAME="66"></A>Tiberius more deeply than the enthusiasm kindled in favor of Agrippina, 
<A NAME="67"></A>whom men spoke of as the glory of the country, the sole surviving off spring 
<A NAME="68"></A>of Augustus, the solitary example of the old times, while looking up to 
<A NAME="69"></A>heaven and the gods they prayed for the safety of her children and that 
<A NAME="70"></A>they might outlive their oppressors.
<A NAME="71"></A><BR><BR>Some there were who missed the grandeur of a state-funeral, and 
<A NAME="72"></A>contrasted the splendid honours conferred by Augustus on Drusus, the father 
<A NAME="73"></A>of Germanicus. "Then the emperor himself," they said, "went in the extreme 
<A NAME="74"></A>rigour of winter as far as Ticinum, and never leaving the corpse entered 
<A NAME="75"></A>Rome with it. Round the funeral bier were ranged the images of the Claudii 
<A NAME="76"></A>and the Julii; there was weeping in the forum, and a panegyric before the 
<A NAME="77"></A>rostra; every honour devised by our ancestors or invented by their descendants 
<A NAME="78"></A>was heaped on him. But as for Germanicus, even the customary distinctions 
<A NAME="79"></A>due to any noble had not fallen to his lot. Granting that his body, because 
<A NAME="80"></A>of the distance of tie journey, was burnt in any fashion in foreign lands, 
<A NAME="81"></A>still all the more honours ought to have been afterwards paid him, because 
<A NAME="82"></A>at first chance had denied them. His brother had gone but one day's journey 
<A NAME="83"></A>to meet him; his uncle, not even to the city gates. Where were all those 
<A NAME="84"></A>usages of the past, the image at the head of the bier, the lays composed 
<A NAME="85"></A>in commemoration of worth, the eulogies and laments, or at least the semblance 
<A NAME="86"></A>of grief?"
<A NAME="87"></A><BR><BR>All this was known to Tiberius, and, to silence popular talk, he 
<A NAME="88"></A>reminded the people in a proclamation that many eminent Romans had died 
<A NAME="89"></A>for their country and that none had been honoured with such passionate 
<A NAME="90"></A>regret. This regret was a glory both to himself and to all, provided only 
<A NAME="91"></A>a due mean were observed; for what was becoming in humble homes and communities, 
<A NAME="92"></A>did not befit princely personages and an imperial people. Tears and the 
<A NAME="93"></A>solace found in mourning were suitable enough for the first burst of grief; 
<A NAME="94"></A>but now they must brace their hearts to endurance, as in former days the 
<A NAME="95"></A>Divine Julius after the loss of his only daughter, and the Divine Augustus 
<A NAME="96"></A>when he was bereft of his grandchildren, had thrust away their sorrow. 
<A NAME="97"></A>There was no need of examples from the past, showing how often the Roman 
<A NAME="98"></A>people had patiently endured the defeats of armies, the destruction of 
<A NAME="99"></A>generals, the total extinction of noble families. Princes were mortal; 
<A NAME="100"></A>the State was everlasting. Let them then return to their usual pursuits, 
<A NAME="101"></A>and, as the shows of the festival of the Great Goddess were at hand, even 
<A NAME="102"></A>resume their amusements.
<A NAME="103"></A><BR><BR>The suspension of business then ceased, and men went back to their 
<A NAME="104"></A>occupations. Drusus was sent to the armies of Illyricum, amidst an universal 
<A NAME="105"></A>eagerness to exact vengeance on Piso, and ceaseless complaints that he 
<A NAME="106"></A>was meantime roaming through the delightful regions of Asia and Achaia, 
<A NAME="107"></A>and was weakening the proofs of his guilt by an insolent and artful procrastination. 
<A NAME="108"></A>It was indeed widely rumoured that the notorius poisoner Martina, who, 
<A NAME="109"></A>as I have related, had been despatched to Rome by Cneius Sentius, had died 
<A NAME="110"></A>suddenly at Brundisium; that poison was concealed in a knot of her hair, 
<A NAME="111"></A>and that no symptoms of suicide were discovered on her 
<A NAME="112"></A>person.
<A NAME="113"></A><BR><BR>Piso meanwhile sent his son on to Rome with a message intended 
<A NAME="114"></A>to pacify the emporer, and then made his way to Drusus, who would, he hoped, 
<A NAME="115"></A>be not so much infuriated at his brother's death as kindly disposed towards 
<A NAME="116"></A>himself in consequence of a rival's removal. Tiberius, to show his impartiality, 
<A NAME="117"></A>received the youth courteously, and enriched him with the liberality he 
<A NAME="118"></A>usually bestowed on the sons of noble families. Drusus replied to Piso 
<A NAME="119"></A>that if certain insinuations were true, he must be foremost in his resentment, 
<A NAME="120"></A>but he preferred to believe that they were false and groundless, and that 
<A NAME="121"></A>Germanicus's death need be the ruin of no one. This he said openly, avoiding 
<A NAME="122"></A>anything like secrecy. Men did not doubt that his answer prescribed him 
<A NAME="123"></A>by Tiberius, inasmuch as one who had generally all the simplicity and candour 
<A NAME="124"></A>of youth, now had recourse to the artifices of old age.
<A NAME="125"></A><BR><BR>Piso, after crossing the Dalmatian sea and leaving his ships at 
<A NAME="126"></A>Ancona, went through Picenum and along the Flaminian road, where he overtook 
<A NAME="127"></A>a legion which was marching from Pannonia to Rome and was then to garrison 
<A NAME="128"></A>Africa. It was a matter of common talk how he had repeatedly displayed 
<A NAME="129"></A>himself to the soldiers on the road during the march. From Narnia, to avoid 
<A NAME="130"></A>suspicion or because the plans of fear are uncertain, he sailed down the 
<A NAME="131"></A>Nar, then down the Tiber, and increased the fury of the populace by bringing 
<A NAME="132"></A>his vessel to shore at the tomb of the Caesars. In broad daylight, when 
<A NAME="133"></A>the river-bank was thronged, he himself with a numerous following of dependents, 
<A NAME="134"></A>and Plancina with a retinue of women, moved onward with joy in their countenances. 
<A NAME="135"></A>Among other things which provoked men's anger was his house towering above 
<A NAME="136"></A>the forum, gay with festal decorations, his banquets and his feasts, about 
<A NAME="137"></A>which there was no secrecy, because the place was so 
<A NAME="138"></A>public.
<A NAME="139"></A><BR><BR>Next day, Fulcinius Trio asked the consul's leave to prosecute 
<A NAME="140"></A>Piso. It was contended against him by Vitellius and Veranius and the others 
<A NAME="141"></A>who had been the companions of Germanicus, that this was not Trio's proper 
<A NAME="142"></A>part, and that they themselves meant to report their instructions from 
<A NAME="143"></A>Germanicus, not as accusers, but as deponents and witnesses to facts. Trio, 
<A NAME="144"></A>abandoning the prosecution on this count, obtained leave to accuse Piso's 
<A NAME="145"></A>previous career, and the emperor was requested to undertake the inquiry. 
<A NAME="146"></A>This even the accused did not refuse, fearing, as he did, the bias of the 
<A NAME="147"></A>people and of the Senate; while Tiberius, he knew, was resolute enough 
<A NAME="148"></A>to despise report, and was also entangled in his mother's complicity. Truth 
<A NAME="149"></A>too would be more easily distinguished from perverse misrepresentation 
<A NAME="150"></A>by a single judge, where a number would be swayed by hatred and 
<A NAME="151"></A>ill-will.
<A NAME="152"></A><BR><BR>Tiberius was not unaware of the formidable difficulty of the inquiry 
<A NAME="153"></A>and of the rumours by which he was himself assailed. Having therefore summoned 
<A NAME="154"></A>a few intimate friends, he listened to the threatening speeches of the 
<A NAME="155"></A>prosecutors and to the pleadings of the accused, and finally referred the 
<A NAME="156"></A>whole case to the Senate.
<A NAME="157"></A><BR><BR>Drusus meanwhile, on his return from Illyricum, though the Senate 
<A NAME="158"></A>had voted him an ovation for the submission of Maroboduus and the successes 
<A NAME="159"></A>of the previous summer, postponed the honour and entered Rome. Then the 
<A NAME="160"></A>defendant sought the advocacy of Lucius Arruntius, Marcus Vinicius, Asinius 
<A NAME="161"></A>Gallus, Aeserninus Marcellus and Sextus Pompeius, and on their declining 
<A NAME="162"></A>for different reasons, Marcus Lepidus, Lucius Piso, and Livineius Regulus 
<A NAME="163"></A>became his counsel, amid the excitement of the whole country, which wondered 
<A NAME="164"></A>how much fidelity would be shown by the friends of Germanicus, on what 
<A NAME="165"></A>the accused rested his hopes, and how far Tiberius would repress and hide 
<A NAME="166"></A>his feelings. Never were the people more keenly interested; never did they 
<A NAME="167"></A>indulge themselves more freely in secret whispers against the emperor or 
<A NAME="168"></A>in the silence of suspicion.
<A NAME="169"></A><BR><BR>On the day the Senate met, Tiberius delivered a speech of studied 
<A NAME="170"></A>moderation. "Piso," he said, "was my father's representative and friend, 
<A NAME="171"></A>and was appointed by myself, on the advice of the Senate, to assist Germanicus 
<A NAME="172"></A>in the administration of the East. Whether he there had provoked the young 
<A NAME="173"></A>prince by wilful opposition and rivalry, and had rejoiced at his death 
<A NAME="174"></A>or wickedly destroyed him, is for you to determine with minds unbiassed. 
<A NAME="175"></A>Certainly if a subordinate oversteps the bounds of duty and of obedience 
<A NAME="176"></A>to his commander, and has exulted in his death and in my affliction, I 
<A NAME="177"></A>shall hate him and exclude him from my house, and I shall avenge a personal 
<A NAME="178"></A>quarrel without resorting to my power as emperor. If however a crime is 
<A NAME="179"></A>discovered which ought to be punished, whoever the murdered man may be, 
<A NAME="180"></A>it is for you to give just reparation both to the children of Germanicus 
<A NAME="181"></A>and to us, his parents.
<A NAME="182"></A><BR><BR>"Consider this too, whether Piso dealt with the armies in a revolutionary 
<A NAME="183"></A>and seditious spirit; whether he sought by intrigue popularity with the 
<A NAME="184"></A>soldiers; whether he attempted to repossess himself of the province by 
<A NAME="185"></A>arms, or whether these are falsehoods which his accusers have published 
<A NAME="186"></A>with exaggeration. As for them, I am justly angry with their intemperate 
<A NAME="187"></A>zeal. For to what purpose did they strip the corpse and expose it to the 
<A NAME="188"></A>pollution of the vulgar gaze, and circulate a story among foreigners that 
<A NAME="189"></A>he was destroyed by poison, if all this is still doubtful and requires 
<A NAME="190"></A>investigation? For my part, I sorrow for my son and shall always sorrow 
<A NAME="191"></A>for him; still I would not hinder the accused from producing all the evidence 
<A NAME="192"></A>which can relieve his innocence or convict Germanicus of any unfairness, 
<A NAME="193"></A>if such there was. And I implore you not to take as proven charges alleged, 
<A NAME="194"></A>merely because the case is intimately bound up with my affliction. Do you, 
<A NAME="195"></A>whom ties of blood or your own true-heartedness have made his advocates, 
<A NAME="196"></A>help him in his peril, every one of you, as far as each man's eloquence 
<A NAME="197"></A>and diligence can do so. To like exertions and like persistency I would 
<A NAME="198"></A>urge the prosecutors. In this, and in this only, will we place Germanicus 
<A NAME="199"></A>above the laws, by conducting the inquiry into his death in this house 
<A NAME="200"></A>instead of in the forum, and before the Senate instead of before a bench 
<A NAME="201"></A>of judges. In all else let the case be tried as simply as others. Let no 
<A NAME="202"></A>one heed the tears of Drusus or my own sorrow, or any stories invented 
<A NAME="203"></A>to our discredit."
<A NAME="204"></A><BR><BR>Two days were then assigned for the bringing forward of the charges, 
<A NAME="205"></A>and after six days' interval, the prisoner's defence was to occupy three 
<A NAME="206"></A>days. Thereupon Fulcinius Trio began with some old and irrelevant accusations 
<A NAME="207"></A>about intrigues and extortion during Piso's government of Spain. This, 
<A NAME="208"></A>if proved, would not have been fatal to the defendant, if he cleared himself 
<A NAME="209"></A>as to his late conduct, and, if refuted, would not have secured his acquittal, 
<A NAME="210"></A>if he were convicted of the greater crimes. Next, Servaeus, Veranius, and 
<A NAME="211"></A>Vitellius, all with equal earnestness, Vitellius with striking eloquence, 
<A NAME="212"></A>alleged against Piso that out of hatred of Germanicus and a desire of revolution 
<A NAME="213"></A>he had so corrupted the common soldiers by licence and oppression of the 
<A NAME="214"></A>allies that he was called by the vilest of them "father of the legions" 
<A NAME="215"></A>while on the other hand to all the best men, especially to the companions 
<A NAME="216"></A>and friends of Germanicus, he had been savagely cruel. Lastly, he had, 
<A NAME="217"></A>they said, destroyed Germanicus himself by sorceries and poison, and hence 
<A NAME="218"></A>came those ceremonies and horrible sacrifices made by himself and Plancina; 
<A NAME="219"></A>then he had threatened the State with war, and had been defeated in battle, 
<A NAME="220"></A>before he could be tried as a prisoner.
<A NAME="221"></A><BR><BR>On all points but one the defence broke down. That he had tampered 
<A NAME="222"></A>with the soldiers, that his province had been at the mercy of the vilest 
<A NAME="223"></A>of them, that he had even insulted his chief, he could not deny. It was 
<A NAME="224"></A>only the charge of poisoning from which he seemed to have cleared himself. 
<A NAME="225"></A>This indeed the prosecutors did not adequately sustain by merely alleging 
<A NAME="226"></A>that at a banquet given by Germanicus, his food had been tainted with poison 
<A NAME="227"></A>by the hands of Piso who sat next above him. It seemed absurd to suppose 
<A NAME="228"></A>that he would have dared such an attempt among strange servants, in the 
<A NAME="229"></A>sight of so many bystanders, and under Germanicus's own eyes. And, besides, 
<A NAME="230"></A>the defendant offered his slaves to the torture, and insisted on its application 
<A NAME="231"></A>to the attendants on that occasion. But the judges for different reasons 
<A NAME="232"></A>were merciless, the emperor, because war had been made on a province, the 
<A NAME="233"></A>Senate because they could not be sufficiently convinced that there had 
<A NAME="234"></A>been no treachery about the death of Germanicus.
<A NAME="235"></A><BR><BR>At the same time shouts were heard from the people in front of 
<A NAME="236"></A>the Senate House, threatening violence if he escaped the verdict of the 
<A NAME="237"></A>Senators. They had actually dragged Piso's statues to the Gemonian stairs, 
<A NAME="238"></A>and were breaking them in pieces, when by the emperor's order they were 
<A NAME="239"></A>rescued and replaced. Piso was then put in a litter and attended by a tribune 
<A NAME="240"></A>of one of the Praetorian cohorts, who followed him, so it was variously 
<A NAME="241"></A>rumoured, to guard his person or to be his executioner.
<A NAME="242"></A><BR><BR>Plancina was equally detested, but had stronger interest. Consequently 
<A NAME="243"></A>it was considered a question how far the emperor would be allowed to go 
<A NAME="244"></A>against her. While Piso's hopes were in suspense, she offered to share 
<A NAME="245"></A>his lot, whatever it might be, and in the worst event, to be his companion 
<A NAME="246"></A>in death. But as soon as she had secured her pardon through the secret 
<A NAME="247"></A>intercessions of Augusta, she gradually withdrew from her husband and separated 
<A NAME="248"></A>her defence from his. When the prisoner saw that this was fatal to him, 
<A NAME="249"></A>he hesitated whether he should still persist, but at the urgent request 
<A NAME="250"></A>of his sons braced his courage and once more entered the Senate. There 
<A NAME="251"></A>he bore patiently the renewal of the accusation, the furious voices of 
<A NAME="252"></A>the Senators, savage opposition indeed from every quarter, but nothing 
<A NAME="253"></A>daunted him so much as to see Tiberius, without pity and without anger, 
<A NAME="254"></A>resolutely closing himself against any inroad of emotion. He was conveyed 
<A NAME="255"></A>back to his house, where, seemingly by way of preparing his defence for 
<A NAME="256"></A>the next day, he wrote a few words, sealed the paper and handed it to a 
<A NAME="257"></A>freedman. Then he bestowed the usual attention on his person; after a while, 
<A NAME="258"></A>late at night, his wife having left his chamber, he ordered the doors to 
<A NAME="259"></A>be closed, and at daybreak was found with his throat cut and a sword lying 
<A NAME="260"></A>on the ground.
<A NAME="261"></A><BR><BR>I remember to have heard old men say that a document was often 
<A NAME="262"></A>seen in Piso's hands, the substance of which he never himself divulged, 
<A NAME="263"></A>but which his friends repeatedly declared contained a letter from Tiberius 
<A NAME="264"></A>with instructions referring to Germanicus, and that it was his intention 
<A NAME="265"></A>to produce it before the Senate and upbraid the emperor, had he not been 
<A NAME="266"></A>deluded by vain promises from Sejanus. Nor did he perish, they said, by 
<A NAME="267"></A>his own hand, but by that of one sent to be his executioner. Neither of 
<A NAME="268"></A>these statements would I positively affirm; still it would not have been 
<A NAME="269"></A>right for me to conceal what was related by those who lived up to the time 
<A NAME="270"></A>of my youth.
<A NAME="271"></A><BR><BR>The emperor, assuming an air of sadness, complained in the Senate 
<A NAME="272"></A>that the purpose of such a death was to bring odium on himself, and he 
<A NAME="273"></A>asked with repeated questionings how Piso had spent his last day and night. 
<A NAME="274"></A>Receiving answers which were mostly judicious, though in part somewhat 
<A NAME="275"></A>incautious, he read out a note written by Piso, nearly to the following 
<A NAME="276"></A>effect:-
<A NAME="277"></A><BR><BR>"Crushed by a conspiracy of my foes and the odium excited by a 
<A NAME="278"></A>lying charge, since my truth and innocence find no place here, I call the 
<A NAME="279"></A>immortal gods to witness that towards you Caesar, I have lived loyally, 
<A NAME="280"></A>and with like dutiful respect towards your mother. And I implore you to 
<A NAME="281"></A>think of my children, one of whom, Cneius is in way implicated in my career, 
<A NAME="282"></A>whatever it may have been, seeing that all this time he has been at Rome, 
<A NAME="283"></A>while the other, Marcus Piso, dissuaded me from returning to Syria. Would 
<A NAME="284"></A>that I had yielded to my young son rather than he to his aged father! And 
<A NAME="285"></A>therefore I pray the more earnestly that the innocent may not pay the penalty 
<A NAME="286"></A>of my wickedness. By forty-five years of obedience, by my association with 
<A NAME="287"></A>you in the consulate, as one who formerly won the esteem of the Divine 
<A NAME="288"></A>Augustus, your father, as one who is your friend and will never hereafter 
<A NAME="289"></A>ask a favour, I implore you to save my unhappy son." About Plancina he 
<A NAME="290"></A>added not a word.
<A NAME="291"></A><BR><BR>Tiberius after this acquitted the young Piso of the charge of civil 
<A NAME="292"></A>war on the ground that a son could not have refused a father's orders, 
<A NAME="293"></A>compassionating at the same time the high rank of the family and the terrible 
<A NAME="294"></A>downfall even of Piso himself, however he might have deserved it. For Plancina 
<A NAME="295"></A>he spoke with shame and conscious disgrace, alleging in excuse the intercession 
<A NAME="296"></A>of his mother, secret complaints against whom from all good men were growing 
<A NAME="297"></A>more and more vehement. "So it was the duty of a grandmother," people said, 
<A NAME="298"></A>"to look a grandson's murderess in the face, to converse with her and rescue 
<A NAME="299"></A>her from the Senate. What the laws secure on behalf of every citizen, had 
<A NAME="300"></A>to Germanicus alone been denied. The voices of a Vitellius and Veranius 
<A NAME="301"></A>had bewailed a Caesar, while the emperor and Augusta had defended Plancina. 
<A NAME="302"></A>She might as well now turn her poisonings, and her devices which had proved 
<A NAME="303"></A>so successful, against Agrippina and her children, and thus sate this exemplary 
<A NAME="304"></A>grandmother and uncle with the blood of a most unhappy 
<A NAME="305"></A>house."
<A NAME="306"></A><BR><BR>Two days were frittered away over this mockery of a trial, Tiberius 
<A NAME="307"></A>urging Piso's children to defend their mother. While the accusers and their 
<A NAME="308"></A>witnesses pressed the prosecution with rival zeal, and there was no reply, 
<A NAME="309"></A>pity rather than anger was on the increase. Aurelius Cotta, the consul, 
<A NAME="310"></A>who was first called on for his vote (for when the emperor put the question, 
<A NAME="311"></A>even those in office went through the duty of voting), held that Piso's 
<A NAME="312"></A>name ought to be erased from the public register, half of his property 
<A NAME="313"></A>confiscated, half given up to his son, Cneius Piso, who was to change his 
<A NAME="314"></A>first name; that Marcus Piso, stript of his rank, with an allowance of 
<A NAME="315"></A>five million sesterces, should be banished for ten years, Plancina's life 
<A NAME="316"></A>being spared in consideration of Augusta's intercession.
<A NAME="317"></A><BR><BR>Much of the sentence was mitigated by the emperor. The name of 
<A NAME="318"></A>Piso was not to be struck out of the public register, since that of Marcus 
<A NAME="319"></A>Antonius who had made war on his country, and that of Julius Antonius who 
<A NAME="320"></A>had dishonoured the house of Augustus, still remained. Marcus Piso too 
<A NAME="321"></A>he saved from degradation, and gave him his father's property, for he was 
<A NAME="322"></A>firm enough, as I have often related, against the temptation of money, 
<A NAME="323"></A>and now for very shame at Plancina's acquittal, he was more than usually 
<A NAME="324"></A>merciful. Again, when Valerius Messalinus and Caecina Severus proposed 
<A NAME="325"></A>respectively the erection of a golden statue in the temple of Mars the 
<A NAME="326"></A>Avenger and of an altar to Vengeance, he interposed, protesting that victories 
<A NAME="327"></A>over the foreigner were commemorated with such monuments, but that domestic 
<A NAME="328"></A>woes ought to be shrouded in silent grief.
<A NAME="329"></A><BR><BR>There was a further proposal of Messalinus, that Tiberius, Augusta, 
<A NAME="330"></A>Antonia, Agrippina and Drusus ought to be publicly thanked for having avenged 
<A NAME="331"></A>Germanicus. He omitted all mention of Claudius. Thereupon he was pointedly 
<A NAME="332"></A>asked by Lucius Asprenas before the Senate, whether the omission had been 
<A NAME="333"></A>intentional, and it was only then that the name of Claudius was added. 
<A NAME="334"></A>For my part, the wider the scope of my reflection on the present and the 
<A NAME="335"></A>past, the more am I impressed by their mockery of human plans in every 
<A NAME="336"></A>transaction. Clearly, the very last man marked out for empire by public 
<A NAME="337"></A>opinion, expectation and general respect was he whom fortune was holding 
<A NAME="338"></A>in reserve as the emperor of the future.
<A NAME="339"></A><BR><BR>A few days afterwards the emperor proposed to the Senate to confer 
<A NAME="340"></A>the priesthood on Vitellius, Veranius and Servaeus. To Fulcinius he promised 
<A NAME="341"></A>his support in seeking promotion, but warned him not to ruin his eloquence 
<A NAME="342"></A>by rancour. This was the end of avenging the death of Germanicus, a subject 
<A NAME="343"></A>of conflicting rumours not only among the people then living but also in 
<A NAME="344"></A>after times. So obscure are the greatest events, as some take for granted 
<A NAME="345"></A>any hearsay, whatever its source, others turn truth into falsehood, and 
<A NAME="346"></A>both errors find encouragement with posterity.
<A NAME="347"></A><BR><BR>Drusus meanwhile quitted Rome to resume his command and soon afterwards 
<A NAME="348"></A>re-entered the city with an ovation. In the course of a few days his mother 
<A NAME="349"></A>Vipsania died, the only one of all Agrippa's children whose death was without 
<A NAME="350"></A>violence. As for the rest, they perished, some it is certain by the sword, 
<A NAME="351"></A>others it was believed by poison or starvation.
<A NAME="352"></A><BR><BR>That same year Tacfarinas who had been defeated, as I have related, 
<A NAME="353"></A>by Camillus in the previous summer, renewed hostilities in Africa, first 
<A NAME="354"></A>by mere desultory raids, so swift as to be unpunished; next, by destroying 
<A NAME="355"></A>villages and carrying off plunder wholesale. Finally, he hemmed in a Roman 
<A NAME="356"></A>cohort near the river Pagyda. The position was commanded by Decrius, a 
<A NAME="357"></A>soldier energetic in action and experienced in war, who regarded the siege 
<A NAME="358"></A>as a disgrace. Cheering on his men to offer battle in the open plain, he 
<A NAME="359"></A>drew up his line in front of his intrenchments. At the first shock, the 
<A NAME="360"></A>cohort was driven back, upon which he threw himself fearlessly amid the 
<A NAME="361"></A>missiles in the path of the fugitives and cried shame on the standard-bearers 
<A NAME="362"></A>for letting Roman soldiers show their backs to a rabble of deserters. At 
<A NAME="363"></A>the same moment he was covered with wounds, and though pierced through 
<A NAME="364"></A>the eye, he resolutely faced the enemy and ceased not to fight till he 
<A NAME="365"></A>fell deserted by his men.
<A NAME="366"></A><BR><BR>On receiving this information, Lucius Apronius, successor to Camillus, 
<A NAME="367"></A>alarmed more by the dishonour of his own men than by the glory of the enemy, 
<A NAME="368"></A>ventured on a deed quite exceptional at that time and derived from old 
<A NAME="369"></A>tradition. He flogged to death every tenth man drawn by lot from the disgraced 
<A NAME="370"></A>cohort. So beneficial was this rigour that a detachment of veterans, numbering 
<A NAME="371"></A>not more than five hundred, routed those same troops of Tacfarinas on their 
<A NAME="372"></A>attacking a fortress named Thala. In this engagement Rufus Helvius, a common 
<A NAME="373"></A>soldier, won the honour of saving a citizen's life, and was rewarded by 
<A NAME="374"></A>Apronius with a neck-chain and a spear. To these the emperor added the 
<A NAME="375"></A>civic crown, complaining, but without anger, that Apronius had not used 
<A NAME="376"></A>his right as proconsul to bestow this further distinction.
<A NAME="377"></A><BR><BR>Tacfarinas, however, finding that the Numidians were cowed and 
<A NAME="378"></A>had a horror of siege-operations, pursued a desultory warfare, retreating 
<A NAME="379"></A>when he was pressed, and then again hanging on his enemy's rear. While 
<A NAME="380"></A>the barbarian continued these tactics, he could safely insult the baffled 
<A NAME="381"></A>and exhausted Romans. But when he marched away towards the coast and, hampered 
<A NAME="382"></A>with booty, fixed himself in a regular camp, Caesianus was despatched by 
<A NAME="383"></A>his father Apronius with some cavalry and auxiliary infantry, reinforced 
<A NAME="384"></A>by the most active of the legionaries, and, after a successful battle with 
<A NAME="385"></A>the Numidians, drove them into the desert.
<A NAME="386"></A><BR><BR>At Rome meanwhile Lepida, who beside the glory of being one of 
<A NAME="387"></A>the Aemilii was the great-granddaughter of Lucius Sulla and Cneius Pompeius, 
<A NAME="388"></A>was accused of pretending to be a mother by Publius Quirinus, a rich and 
<A NAME="389"></A>childless man. Then, too, there were charges of adulteries, of poisonings, 
<A NAME="390"></A>and of inquiries made through astrologers concerning the imperial house. 
<A NAME="391"></A>The accused was defended by her brother Manius Lepidus. Quirinus by his 
<A NAME="392"></A>relentless enmity even after his divorce, had procured for her some sympathy, 
<A NAME="393"></A>infamous and guilty as she was. One could not easily perceive the emperor's 
<A NAME="394"></A>feelings at her trial; so effectually did he interchange and blend the 
<A NAME="395"></A>outward signs of resentment and compassion. He first begged the Senate 
<A NAME="396"></A>not to deal with the charges of treason, and subsequently induced Marcus 
<A NAME="397"></A>Servilius, an ex-consul, to divulge what he had seemingly wished to suppress. 
<A NAME="398"></A>He also handed over to the consuls Lepida's slaves, who were in military 
<A NAME="399"></A>custody, but would not allow them to be examined by torture on matters 
<A NAME="400"></A>referring to his own family. Drusus too, the consul-elect, he released 
<A NAME="401"></A>from the necessity of having to speak first to the question. Some thought 
<A NAME="402"></A>this a gracious act, done to save the rest of the Senators from a compulsory 
<A NAME="403"></A>assent, while others ascribed it to malignity, on the ground that he would 
<A NAME="404"></A>have yielded only where there was a necessity of condemning.
<A NAME="405"></A><BR><BR>On the days of the games which interrupted the trial, Lepida went 
<A NAME="406"></A>into the theatre with some ladies of rank, and as she appealed with piteous 
<A NAME="407"></A>wailings to her ancestors and to that very Pompey, the public buildings 
<A NAME="408"></A>and statues of whom stood there before their eyes, she roused such sympathy 
<A NAME="409"></A>that people burst into tears and shouted, without ceasing, savage curses 
<A NAME="410"></A>on Quirinus, "to whose childless old-age and miserably obscure family, 
<A NAME="411"></A>one once destined to be the wife of Lucius Caesar and the daughter-in-law 
<A NAME="412"></A>of the Divine Augustus was being sacrificed." Then, by the torture of the 
<A NAME="413"></A>slaves, her infamies were brought to light, and a motion of Rubellius Blandus 
<A NAME="414"></A>was carried which outlawed her. Drusus supported him, though others had 
<A NAME="415"></A>proposed a milder sentence. Subsequently, Scaurus, who had had daughter 
<A NAME="416"></A>by her, obtained as a concession that her property should not be confiscated. 
<A NAME="417"></A>Then at last Tiberius declared that he had himself too ascertained from 
<A NAME="418"></A>the slaves of Publius Quirinus that Lepida had attempted their master's 
<A NAME="419"></A>life by poison.
<A NAME="420"></A><BR><BR>It was some compensation for the misfortunes of great houses (for 
<A NAME="421"></A>within a short interval the Calpurnii had lost Piso and the Aemilii Lepida) 
<A NAME="422"></A>that Decimus Silanus was now restored to the Junian family. I will briefly 
<A NAME="423"></A>relate his downfall.
<A NAME="424"></A><BR><BR>Though the Divine Augustus in his public life enjoyed unshaken 
<A NAME="425"></A>prosperity, he was unfortunate at home from the profligacy of his daughter 
<A NAME="426"></A>and granddaughter, both of whom he banished from Rome, and punished their 
<A NAME="427"></A>paramours with death or exile. Calling, as he did, a vice so habitual among 
<A NAME="428"></A>men and women by the awful name of sacrilege and treason, he went far beyond 
<A NAME="429"></A>the indulgent spirit of our ancestors, beyond indeed his own legislation. 
<A NAME="430"></A>But I will relate the deaths of others with the remaining events of that 
<A NAME="431"></A>time, if after finishing the work I have now proposed to myself, I prolong 
<A NAME="432"></A>my life for further labours.
<A NAME="433"></A><BR><BR>Decimus Silanus, the paramour of the granddaughter of Augustus, 
<A NAME="434"></A>though the only severity he experienced was exclusion from the emperor's 
<A NAME="435"></A>friendship, saw clearly that it meant exile; and it was not till Tiberius's 
<A NAME="436"></A>reign that he ventured to appeal to the Senate and to the prince, in reliance 
<A NAME="437"></A>on the influence of his brother Marcus Silanus, who was conspicuous both 
<A NAME="438"></A>for his distinguished rank and eloquence. But Tiberius, when Silanus thanked 
<A NAME="439"></A>him, replied in the Senate's presence, "that he too rejoiced at the brother's 
<A NAME="440"></A>return from his long foreign tour, and that this was justly allowable, 
<A NAME="441"></A>inasmuch as he had been banished not by a decree of the Senate or under 
<A NAME="442"></A>any law. Still, personally," he said, "he felt towards him his father's 
<A NAME="443"></A>resentment in all its force, and the return of Silanus had not cancelled 
<A NAME="444"></A>the intentions of Augustus." Silanus after this lived at Rome without attaining 
<A NAME="445"></A>office.
<A NAME="446"></A><BR><BR>It was next proposed to relax the Papia Poppaea law, which Augustus 
<A NAME="447"></A>in his old age had passed subsequently to the Julian statutes, for yet 
<A NAME="448"></A>further enforcing the penalties on celibacy and for enriching the exchequer. 
<A NAME="449"></A>And yet, marriages and the rearing of children did not become more frequent, 
<A NAME="450"></A>so powerful were the attractions of a childless state. Meanwhile there 
<A NAME="451"></A>was an increase in the number of persons imperilled, for every household 
<A NAME="452"></A>was undermined by the insinuations of informers; and now the country suffered 
<A NAME="453"></A>from its laws, as it had hitherto suffered from its vices. This suggests 
<A NAME="454"></A>to me a fuller discussion of the origin of law and of the methods by which 
<A NAME="455"></A>we have arrived at the present endless multiplicity and variety of our 
<A NAME="456"></A>statutes.
<A NAME="457"></A><BR><BR>Mankind in the earliest age lived for a time without a single vicious 
<A NAME="458"></A>impulse, without shame or guilt, and, consequently, without punishment 
<A NAME="459"></A>and restraints. Rewards were not needed when everything right was pursued 
<A NAME="460"></A>on its own merits; and as men desired nothing against morality, they were 
<A NAME="461"></A>debarred from nothing by fear. When however they began to throw off equality, 
<A NAME="462"></A>and ambition and violence usurped the place of self-control and modesty, 
<A NAME="463"></A>despotisms grew up and became perpetual among many nations. Some from the 
<A NAME="464"></A>beginning, or when tired of kings, preferred codes of laws. These were 
<A NAME="465"></A>at first simple, while men's minds were unsophisticated. The most famous 
<A NAME="466"></A>of them were those of the Cretans, framed by Minos; those of the Spartans, 
<A NAME="467"></A>by Lycurgus, and, subsequently, those which Solan drew up for the Athenians 
<A NAME="468"></A>on a more elaborate and extensive scale. Romulus governed us as he pleased; 
<A NAME="469"></A>then Numa united our people by religious ties and a constitution of divine 
<A NAME="470"></A>origin, to which some additions were made by Tullus and Ancus. But Servius 
<A NAME="471"></A>Tullius was our chief legislator, to whose laws even kings were to be 
<A NAME="472"></A>subject.
<A NAME="473"></A><BR><BR>After Tarquin's expulsion, the people, to check cabals among the 
<A NAME="474"></A>Senators, devised many safeguards for freedom and for the establishment 
<A NAME="475"></A>of unity. Decemvirs were appointed; everything specially admirable elsewhere 
<A NAME="476"></A>was adopted, and the Twelve Tables drawn up, the last specimen of equitable 
<A NAME="477"></A>legislation. For subsequent enactments, though occasionally directed against 
<A NAME="478"></A>evildoers for some crime, were oftener carried by violence amid class dissensions, 
<A NAME="479"></A>with a view to obtain honours not as yet conceded, or to banish distinguished 
<A NAME="480"></A>citizens, or for other base ends. Hence the Gracchi and Saturnini, those 
<A NAME="481"></A>popular agitators, and Drusus too, as flagrant a corrupter in the Senate's 
<A NAME="482"></A>name; hence, the bribing of our allies by alluring promises and the cheating 
<A NAME="483"></A>them by tribunes vetoes. Even the Italian and then the Civil war did not 
<A NAME="484"></A>pass without the enactment of many conflicting laws, till Lucius Sulla, 
<A NAME="485"></A>the Dictator, by the repeal or alteration of past legislation and by many 
<A NAME="486"></A>additions, gave us a brief lull in this process, to be instantly followed 
<A NAME="487"></A>by the seditious proposals of Lepidus, and soon afterwards by the tribunes 
<A NAME="488"></A>recovering their license to excite the people just as they chose. And now 
<A NAME="489"></A>bills were passed, not only for national objects but for individual cases, 
<A NAME="490"></A>and laws were most numerous when the commonwealth was most 
<A NAME="491"></A>corrupt.
<A NAME="492"></A><BR><BR>Cneius Pompeius was then for the third time elected consul to reform 
<A NAME="493"></A>public morals, but in applying remedies more terrible than the evils and 
<A NAME="494"></A>repealing the legislation of which he had himself been the author, he lost 
<A NAME="495"></A>by arms what by arms he had been maintaining. Then followed twenty years 
<A NAME="496"></A>of continuous strife; custom or law there was none; the vilest deeds went 
<A NAME="497"></A>unpunished, while many noble acts brought ruin. At last, in his sixth consulship, 
<A NAME="498"></A>Caesar Augustus, feeling his power secure, annulled the decrees of his 
<A NAME="499"></A>triumvirate, and gave us a constitution which might serve us in peace under 
<A NAME="500"></A>a monarchy. Henceforth our chains became more galling, and spies were set 
<A NAME="501"></A>over us, stimulated by rewards under the Papia Poppaea law, so that if 
<A NAME="502"></A>men shrank from the privileges of fatherhood, the State, as universal parent, 
<A NAME="503"></A>might possess their ownerless properties. But this espionage became too 
<A NAME="504"></A>searching, and Rome and Italy and Roman citizens everywhere fell into its 
<A NAME="505"></A>clutches. Many men's fortunes were ruined, and over all there hung a terror 
<A NAME="506"></A>till Tiberius, to provide a remedy, selected by lot five ex-consuls, five 
<A NAME="507"></A>ex-praetors, and five senators, by whom most of the legal knots were disentangled 
<A NAME="508"></A>and some light temporary relief afforded.
<A NAME="509"></A><BR><BR>About this same time he commended to the Senate's favour, Nero, 
<A NAME="510"></A>Germanicus's son, who was just entering on manhood, and asked them, not 
<A NAME="511"></A>without smiles of ridicule from his audience, to exempt him from serving 
<A NAME="512"></A>as one of the Twenty Commissioners, and let him be a candidate for quaestorship 
<A NAME="513"></A>five years earlier than the law allowed. His excuse was that a similar 
<A NAME="514"></A>decree had been made for himself and his brother at the request of Augustus. 
<A NAME="515"></A>But I cannot doubt that even then there were some who secretly laughed 
<A NAME="516"></A>at such a petition, though the Caesars were but in the beginning of their 
<A NAME="517"></A>grandeur, and ancient usage was more constantly before men's eyes, while 
<A NAME="518"></A>also the tie between stepfather and stepson was weaker than that between 
<A NAME="519"></A>grandfather and grandchild. The pontificate was likewise conferred on Nero, 
<A NAME="520"></A>and on the day on which he first entered the forum, a gratuity was given 
<A NAME="521"></A>to the city-populace, who greatly rejoiced at seeing a son of Germanicus 
<A NAME="522"></A>now grown to manhood. Their joy was further increased by Nero's marriage 
<A NAME="523"></A>to Julia, Drusus's daughter. This news was met with favourable comments, 
<A NAME="524"></A>but it was heard with disgust that Sejanus was to be the father-in-law 
<A NAME="525"></A>of the son of Claudius. The emperor was thought to have polluted the nobility 
<A NAME="526"></A>of his house and to have yet further elevated Sejanus, whom they already 
<A NAME="527"></A>suspected of overweening ambition.
<A NAME="528"></A><BR><BR>Two remarkable men died at the end of the year, Lucius Volusius 
<A NAME="529"></A>and Sallustius Crispus. Volusius was of an old family, which had however 
<A NAME="530"></A>never risen beyond the praetorship. He brought into it the consulship; 
<A NAME="531"></A>he also held the office of censor for arranging the classes of the knights, 
<A NAME="532"></A>and was the first to pile up the wealth which that house enjoyed to a boundless 
<A NAME="533"></A>extent.
<A NAME="534"></A><BR><BR>Crispus was of equestrian descent and grandson of a sister of Caius 
<A NAME="535"></A>Sallustius, that most admirable Roman historian, by whom he was adopted 
<A NAME="536"></A>and whose name he took. Though his road to preferment was easy, he chose 
<A NAME="537"></A>to emulate Maecenas, and without rising to a senator's rank, he surpassed 
<A NAME="538"></A>in power many who had won triumphs and consulships. He was a contrast to 
<A NAME="539"></A>the manners of antiquity in his elegance and refinement, and in the sumptuousness 
<A NAME="540"></A>of his wealth he was almost a voluptuary. But beneath all this was a vigorous 
<A NAME="541"></A>mind, equal to the greatest labours, the more active in proportion as he 
<A NAME="542"></A>made a show of sloth and apathy. And so while Maecenas lived, he stood 
<A NAME="543"></A>next in favour to him, and was afterwards the chief depository of imperial 
<A NAME="544"></A>secrets, and accessory to the murder of Postumus Agrippa, till in advanced 
<A NAME="545"></A>age he retained the shadow rather than the substance of the emperor's friendship. 
<A NAME="546"></A>The same too had happened to Maecenas, so rarely is it the destiny of power 
<A NAME="547"></A>to be lasting, or perhaps a sense of weariness steals over princes when 
<A NAME="548"></A>they have bestowed everything, or over favourites, when there is nothing 
<A NAME="549"></A>left them to desire.
<A NAME="550"></A><BR><BR>Next followed Tiberius's fourth, Drusus's second consulship, memorable 
<A NAME="551"></A>from the fact that father and son were colleagues. Two years previously 
<A NAME="552"></A>the association of Germanicus and Tiberius in the same honour had not been 
<A NAME="553"></A>agreeable to the uncle, nor had it the link of so close a natural 
<A NAME="554"></A>tie.
<A NAME="555"></A><BR><BR>At the beginning of this year Tiberius, avowedly to recruit his 
<A NAME="556"></A>health, retired to Campania, either as a gradual preparation for long and 
<A NAME="557"></A>uninterrupted seclusion, or in order that Drusus alone in his father's 
<A NAME="558"></A>absence might discharge the duties of the consulship. It happened that 
<A NAME="559"></A>a mere trifle which grew into a sharp contest gave the young prince the 
<A NAME="560"></A>means of acquiring popularity. Domitius Corbulo, an ex-praetor, complained 
<A NAME="561"></A>to the Senate that Lucius Sulla, a young noble, had not given place to 
<A NAME="562"></A>him at a gladiatorial show. Corbulo had age, national usage and the feelings 
<A NAME="563"></A>of the older senators in his favour. Against him Mamercus Scaurus, Lucius 
<A NAME="564"></A>Arruntius and other kinsmen of Sulla strenuously exerted themselves. There 
<A NAME="565"></A>was a keen debate, and appeal was made to the precedents of our ancestors, 
<A NAME="566"></A>as having censured in severe decrees disrespect on the part of the young, 
<A NAME="567"></A>till Drusus argued in a strain calculated to calm their feelings. Corbulo 
<A NAME="568"></A>too received an apology from Mamercus, who was Sulla's uncle and stepfather, 
<A NAME="569"></A>and the most fluent speaker of that day.
<A NAME="570"></A><BR><BR>It was this same Corbulo, who, after raising a cry that most of 
<A NAME="571"></A>the roads in Italy were obstructed or impassable through the dishonesty 
<A NAME="572"></A>of contractors and the negligence of officials, himself willingly undertook 
<A NAME="573"></A>the complete management of the business. This proved not so beneficial 
<A NAME="574"></A>to the State as ruinous to many persons, whose property and credit he mercilessly 
<A NAME="575"></A>attacked by convictions and confiscations.
<A NAME="576"></A><BR><BR>Soon afterwards Tiberius informed the Senate by letter that Africa 
<A NAME="577"></A>was again disturbed by an incursion of Tacfarinas, and that they must use 
<A NAME="578"></A>their judgment in choosing as proconsul an experienced soldier of vigorous 
<A NAME="579"></A>constitution, who would be equal to the war. Sextus Pompeius caught at 
<A NAME="580"></A>this opportunity of venting his hatred against Lepidus, whom he condemned 
<A NAME="581"></A>as a poor-spirited and needy man, who was a disgrace to his ancestors, 
<A NAME="582"></A>and therefore deserved to lose even his chance of the province of Asia. 
<A NAME="583"></A>But the Senate were against him, for they thought Lepidus gentle rather 
<A NAME="584"></A>than cowardly, and that his inherited poverty, with the high rank in which 
<A NAME="585"></A>he had lived without a blot, ought to be considered a credit to instead 
<A NAME="586"></A>of a reproach. And so he was sent to Asia, and with respect to Africa it 
<A NAME="587"></A>was decided that the emperor should choose to whom it was to be 
<A NAME="588"></A>assigned.
<A NAME="589"></A><BR><BR>During this debate Severus Caecina proposed that no magistrate 
<A NAME="590"></A>who had obtained a province should be accompanied by his wife. He began 
<A NAME="591"></A>by recounting at length how harmoniously he had lived with his wife, who 
<A NAME="592"></A>had borne him six children, and how in his own home he had observed what 
<A NAME="593"></A>he was proposing for the public, by having kept her in Italy, though he 
<A NAME="594"></A>had himself served forty campaigns in various provinces. "With good reason," 
<A NAME="595"></A>he said, "had it been formerly decided that women were not to be taken 
<A NAME="596"></A>among our allies or into foreign countries. A train of women involves delays 
<A NAME="597"></A>through luxury in peace and through panic in war, and converts a Roman 
<A NAME="598"></A>army on the march into the likeness of a barbarian progress. Not only is 
<A NAME="599"></A>the sex feeble and unequal to hardship, but, when it has liberty, it is 
<A NAME="600"></A>spiteful, intriguing and greedy of power. They show themselves off among 
<A NAME="601"></A>the soldiers and have the centurions at their beck. Lately a woman had 
<A NAME="602"></A>presided at the drill of the cohorts and the evolutions of the legions. 
<A NAME="603"></A>You should yourselves bear in mind that, whenever men are accused of extortion, 
<A NAME="604"></A>most of the charges are directed against the wives. It is to these that 
<A NAME="605"></A>the vilest of the provincials instantly attach themselves; it is they who 
<A NAME="606"></A>undertake and settle business; two persons receive homage when they appear; 
<A NAME="607"></A>there are two centres of government, and the women's orders are the more 
<A NAME="608"></A>despotic and intemperate. Formerly they were restrained by the Oppian and 
<A NAME="609"></A>other laws; now, loosed from every bond, they rule our houses, our tribunals, 
<A NAME="610"></A>even our armies."
<A NAME="611"></A><BR><BR>A few heard this speech with approval, but the majority clamorously 
<A NAME="612"></A>objected that there was no proper motion on the subject, and that Caecina 
<A NAME="613"></A>was no fit censor on so grave an issue. Presently Valerius Messalinus, 
<A NAME="614"></A>Messala's son, in whom the father's eloquence was reproduced, replied that 
<A NAME="615"></A>much of the sternness of antiquity had been changed into a better and more 
<A NAME="616"></A>genial system. "Rome," he said, "is not now, as formerly, beset with wars, 
<A NAME="617"></A>nor are the provinces hostile. A few concessions are made to the wants 
<A NAME="618"></A>of women, but such as are not even a burden to their husbands homes, much 
<A NAME="619"></A>less to the allies. In all other respects man and wife share alike, and 
<A NAME="620"></A>this arrangement involves no trouble in peace. War of course requires that 
<A NAME="621"></A>men should be unincumbered, but when they return what worthier solace can 
<A NAME="622"></A>they have after their hardships than a wife's society? But some wives have 
<A NAME="623"></A>abandoned themselves to scheming and rapacity. Well; even among our magistrates, 
<A NAME="624"></A>are not many subject to various passions? Still, that is not a reason for 
<A NAME="625"></A>sending no one into a province. Husbands have often been corrupted by the 
<A NAME="626"></A>vices of their wives. Are then all unmarried men blameless? The Oppian 
<A NAME="627"></A>laws were formerly adopted to meet the political necessities of the time, 
<A NAME="628"></A>and subsequently there was some remission and mitigation of them on grounds 
<A NAME="629"></A>of expediency. It is idle to shelter our own weakness under other names; 
<A NAME="630"></A>for it is the husband's fault if the wife transgresses propriety. Besides, 
<A NAME="631"></A>it is wrong that because of the imbecility of one or two men, all husbands 
<A NAME="632"></A>should be cut off from their partners in prosperity and adversity. And 
<A NAME="633"></A>further, a sex naturally weak will be thus left to itself and be at the 
<A NAME="634"></A>mercy of its own voluptuousness and the passions of others. Even with the 
<A NAME="635"></A>husband's personal vigilance the marriage tie is scarcely preserved inviolate. 
<A NAME="636"></A>What would happen were it for a number of years to be forgotten, just as 
<A NAME="637"></A>in a divorce? You must not check vices abroad without remembering the scandals 
<A NAME="638"></A>of the capital."
<A NAME="639"></A><BR><BR>Drusus added a few words on his own experience as a husband. "Princes," 
<A NAME="640"></A>he said, "must often visit the extremities of their empire. How often had 
<A NAME="641"></A>the Divine Augustus travelled to West and to the East accompanied by Livia? 
<A NAME="642"></A>He had himself gone to Illyricum and, should it be expedient, he would 
<A NAME="643"></A>go to other countries, not always however with a contented mind, if he 
<A NAME="644"></A>had to tear himself from a much loved wife, the mother of his many 
<A NAME="645"></A>children."
<A NAME="646"></A><BR><BR>Caecina's motion was thus defeated. At the Senate's next meeting 
<A NAME="647"></A>came a letter from Tiberius, which indirectly censured them for throwing 
<A NAME="648"></A>on the emperor every political care, and named Marcus Lepidus and Junius 
<A NAME="649"></A>Blaesus, one of whom was to be chosen pro-consul of Africa. Both spoke 
<A NAME="650"></A>on the subject, and Lepidus begged earnestly to be excused. He alleged 
<A NAME="651"></A>ill-health, his children's tender age, his having a daughter to marry, 
<A NAME="652"></A>and something more of which he said nothing, was well understood, the fact 
<A NAME="653"></A>that Blaesus was uncle of Sejanus and so had very powerful interest. Blaesus 
<A NAME="654"></A>replied with an affectation of refusal, but not with the same persistency, 
<A NAME="655"></A>nor was he backed up by the acquiescence of flatterers.
<A NAME="656"></A><BR><BR>Next was exposed an abuse, hitherto the subject of many a whispered 
<A NAME="657"></A>complaint. The vilest wretches used a growing freedom in exciting insult 
<A NAME="658"></A>and obloquy against respectable citizens, and escaped punishment by clasping 
<A NAME="659"></A>some statue of the emperor. The very freedman or slave was often an actual 
<A NAME="660"></A>terror to his patron or master whom he would menace by word and gesture. 
<A NAME="661"></A>Accordingly Caius Cestius, a senator, argued that "though princes were 
<A NAME="662"></A>like deities, yet even the gods listened only to righteous prayers from 
<A NAME="663"></A>their suppliants, and that no one fled to the Capitol or any other temple 
<A NAME="664"></A>in Rome to use it as an auxiliary in crime. There was an end and utter 
<A NAME="665"></A>subversion of all law when, in the forum and on the threshold of the Senate 
<A NAME="666"></A>House, Annia Rufilla, whom he had convicted of fraud before a judge, assailed 
<A NAME="667"></A>him with insults and threats, while he did not himself dare to try legal 
<A NAME="668"></A>proceedings, because he was confronted by her with the emperor's image." 
<A NAME="669"></A>There rose other clamorous voices, with even more flagrant complaints, 
<A NAME="670"></A>and all implored Drusus to inflict exemplary vengeance, till he ordered 
<A NAME="671"></A>Rufilla to be summoned, and on her conviction to be confined in the common 
<A NAME="672"></A>prison.
<A NAME="673"></A><BR><BR>Considius Aequus too and Coelius Cursor, Roman knights, were punished 
<A NAME="674"></A>on the emperor's proposal, by a decree of the Senate, for having attacked 
<A NAME="675"></A>the praetor, Magius Caecilianus, with false charges of treason. Both these 
<A NAME="676"></A>results were represented as an honour to Drusus. By moving in society at 
<A NAME="677"></A>Rome, amid popular talk, his father's dark policy, it was thought, was 
<A NAME="678"></A>mitigated. Even voluptuousness in one so young gave little offence. Better 
<A NAME="679"></A>that he should incline that way, spend his days in architecture, his nights 
<A NAME="680"></A>in banquets, than that he should live in solitude, cut off from every pleasure, 
<A NAME="681"></A>and absorbed in a gloomy vigilance and mischievous schemes.
<A NAME="682"></A><BR><BR>Tiberius indeed and the informers were never weary. Ancharius Priscus 
<A NAME="683"></A>had prosecuted Caesius Cordus, proconsul of Crete, for extortion, adding 
<A NAME="684"></A>a charge of treason, which then crowned all indictments. Antistius Vetus, 
<A NAME="685"></A>one of the chief men of Macedonia, who had been acquitted of adultery, 
<A NAME="686"></A>was recalled by the emperor himself, with a censure on the judges, to be 
<A NAME="687"></A>tried for treason, as a seditious man who had been implicated in the designs 
<A NAME="688"></A>of Rhescuporis, when that king after the murder of his brother Cotys had 
<A NAME="689"></A>meditated war against us. The accused was accordingly outlawed, with the 
<A NAME="690"></A>further sentence that he was to be confined in an island from which neither 
<A NAME="691"></A>Macedonia nor Thrace were conveniently accessible.
<A NAME="692"></A><BR><BR>As for Thrace, since the division of the kingdom between Rhoemetalces 
<A NAME="693"></A>and the children of Cotys, who because of their tender age were under the 
<A NAME="694"></A>guardianship of Trebellienus Rufus, it was divided against itself, from 
<A NAME="695"></A>not being used to our rule, and blamed Rhoemetalces no less than Trebellienus 
<A NAME="696"></A>for allowing the wrongs of his countrymen to go unpunished. The Coelaletae, 
<A NAME="697"></A>Odrusae and Dii, powerful tribes, took up arms, under different leaders, 
<A NAME="698"></A>all on a level from their obscurity. This hindered them from combining 
<A NAME="699"></A>in a formidable war. Some roused their immediate neighbourhood; others 
<A NAME="700"></A>crossed Mount Haemus, to stir up remote tribes; most of them, and the best 
<A NAME="701"></A>disciplined, besieged the king in the city of Philippopolis, founded by 
<A NAME="702"></A>the Macedonian Philip.
<A NAME="703"></A><BR><BR>When this was known to Publius Vellaeus who commanded the nearest 
<A NAME="704"></A>army, he sent some allied cavalry and light infantry to attack those who 
<A NAME="705"></A>were roaming in quest of plunder or of reinforcements, while he marched 
<A NAME="706"></A>in person with the main strength of the foot to raise the siege. Every 
<A NAME="707"></A>operation was at the same moment successful; the pillagers were cut to 
<A NAME="708"></A>pieces; dissensions broke out among the besiegers, and the king made a 
<A NAME="709"></A>well-timed sally just as the legion arrived. A battle or even a skirmish 
<A NAME="710"></A>it did not deserve to be called, in which merely half-armed stragglers 
<A NAME="711"></A>were slaughtered without bloodshed on our side.
<A NAME="712"></A><BR><BR>That same year, some states of Gaul, under the pressure of heavy 
<A NAME="713"></A>debts, attempted a revolt. Its most active instigators were Julius Florus 
<A NAME="714"></A>among the Treveri and Julius Sacrovir among the Aedui. Both could show 
<A NAME="715"></A>noble birth and signal services rendered by ancestors, for which Roman 
<A NAME="716"></A>citizenship had formerly been granted them, when the gift was rare and 
<A NAME="717"></A>a recompense only of merit. In secret conferences to which the fiercest 
<A NAME="718"></A>spirits were admitted, or any to whom poverty or the fear of guilt was 
<A NAME="719"></A>an irresistible stimulus to crime, they arranged that Florus was to rouse 
<A NAME="720"></A>the Belgae, Sacrovir the Gauls nearer home. These men accordingly talked 
<A NAME="721"></A>sedition before small gatherings and popular assemblies about the perpetual 
<A NAME="722"></A>tributes, the oppressive usury, the cruelty and arrogance of their governors, 
<A NAME="723"></A>hinting too that there was disaffection among our soldiers, since they 
<A NAME="724"></A>had heard of the murder of Germanicus. "It was," they said, "a grand opportunity 
<A NAME="725"></A>for the recovery of freedom, if only they would contrast their own vigour 
<A NAME="726"></A>with the exhaustion of Italy, the unwarlike character of the city populace, 
<A NAME="727"></A>and the utter weakness of Rome's armies in all but their foreign 
<A NAME="728"></A>element."
<A NAME="729"></A><BR><BR>Scarcely a single community was untouched by the germs of this 
<A NAME="730"></A>commotion. First however in actual revolt were the Andecavi and Turoni. 
<A NAME="731"></A>Of these the former were put down by an officer, Acilius Aviola, who had 
<A NAME="732"></A>summoned a cohort which was on garrison duty at Lugdunum. The Turoni were 
<A NAME="733"></A>quelled by some legionary troops sent by Visellius Varro who commanded 
<A NAME="734"></A>in Lower Germany, and led by the same Aviola and some Gallic chieftains 
<A NAME="735"></A>who brought aid, in order that they might disguise their disaffection and 
<A NAME="736"></A>exhibit it at a better opportunity. Sacrovir too was conspicuous, with 
<A NAME="737"></A>head uncovered, cheering on his men to fight for Rome, to display, as he 
<A NAME="738"></A>said, his valour. But the prisoners asserted that he sought recognition 
<A NAME="739"></A>that he might not be a mark for missiles. Tiberius when consulted on the 
<A NAME="740"></A>matter disdained the information, and fostered the war by his 
<A NAME="741"></A>irresolution.
<A NAME="742"></A><BR><BR>Florus meanwhile followed up his designs and tried to induce a 
<A NAME="743"></A>squadron of cavalry levied among the Treveri, trained in our service and 
<A NAME="744"></A>discipline, to begin hostilities by a massacre of the Roman traders. He 
<A NAME="745"></A>corrupted a few of the men, but the majority were steadfast in their allegiance. 
<A NAME="746"></A>A host however of debtors and dependents took up arms, and they were on 
<A NAME="747"></A>their way to the forest passes known as the Arduenna, when they were stopped 
<A NAME="748"></A>by legions which Visellius and Silius had sent from their respective armies, 
<A NAME="749"></A>by opposite routes, to meet them. Julius Indus from the same state, who 
<A NAME="750"></A>was at feud with Florus and therefore particularly eager to render us a 
<A NAME="751"></A>service, was sent on in advance with a picked force, and dispersed the 
<A NAME="752"></A>undisciplined rabble. Florus after eluding the conquerors by hiding himself 
<A NAME="753"></A>in one place after another, at last when he saw some soldiers who had barred 
<A NAME="754"></A>every possible escape, fell by his own hand. Such was the end of the rebellion 
<A NAME="755"></A>of the Treveri.
<A NAME="756"></A><BR><BR>A more formidable movement broke out among the Aedui, proportioned 
<A NAME="757"></A>to the greater wealth of the state and the distance of the force which 
<A NAME="758"></A>should repress it. Sacrovir with some armed cohorts had made himself master 
<A NAME="759"></A>of Augustodunum, the capital of the tribe, with the noblest youth of Gaul, 
<A NAME="760"></A>there devoting themselves to a liberal education, and with such hostages 
<A NAME="761"></A>he proposed to unite in his cause their parents and kinsfolk. He also distributed 
<A NAME="762"></A>among the youth arms which he had had secretly manufactured. There were 
<A NAME="763"></A>forty thousand, one fifth armed like our legionaries; the rest had spears 
<A NAME="764"></A>and knives and other weapons used in the chase. In addition were some slaves 
<A NAME="765"></A>who were being trained for gladiators, clad after the national fashion 
<A NAME="766"></A>in a complete covering of steel. They were called crupellarii, and though 
<A NAME="767"></A>they were ill-adapted for inflicting wounds, they were impenetrable to 
<A NAME="768"></A>them. This army was continually increased, not yet by any open combination 
<A NAME="769"></A>of the neighbouring states, but by zealous individual enthusiasm, as well 
<A NAME="770"></A>as by strife between the Roman generals, each of whom claimed the war for 
<A NAME="771"></A>himself. Varro after a while, as he was infirm and aged, yielded to Silius 
<A NAME="772"></A>who was in his prime.
<A NAME="773"></A><BR><BR>At Rome meanwhile people said that it was not only the Treveri 
<A NAME="774"></A>and Aedui who had revolted, but sixty-four states of Gaul with the Germans 
<A NAME="775"></A>in alliance, while Spain too was disaffected; anything in fact was believed, 
<A NAME="776"></A>with rumour's usual exaggeration. All good men were saddened by anxiety 
<A NAME="777"></A>for the country, but many in their loathing of the present system and eagerness 
<A NAME="778"></A>for change, rejoiced at their very perils and exclaimed against Tiberius 
<A NAME="779"></A>for giving attention amid such political convulsions to the calumnies of 
<A NAME="780"></A>informers. "Was Sacrovir too," they asked, "to be charged with treason 
<A NAME="781"></A>before the Senate? We have at last found men to check those murderous missives 
<A NAME="782"></A>by the sword. Even war is a good exchange for a miserable peace." Tiberius 
<A NAME="783"></A>all the more studiously assumed an air of unconcern. He changed neither 
<A NAME="784"></A>his residence nor his look, but kept up his usual demeanour during the 
<A NAME="785"></A>whole time, either from the profoundness of his reserve; or was it that 
<A NAME="786"></A>he had convinced himself that the events were unimportant and much more 
<A NAME="787"></A>insignificant than the rumours represented?
<A NAME="788"></A><BR><BR>Silius meantime was advancing with two legions, and having sent 
<A NAME="789"></A>forward some auxiliary troops was ravaging those villages of the Sequani, 
<A NAME="790"></A>which, situated on the border, adjoin the Aedui, and were associated with 
<A NAME="791"></A>them in arms. He then pushed on by forced marches to Augustodunum, his 
<A NAME="792"></A>standard-bearers vying in zeal, and even the privates loudly protesting 
<A NAME="793"></A>against any halt for their usual rest or during the hours of night. "Only," 
<A NAME="794"></A>they said, "let us have the foe face to face; that will be enough for victory." 
<A NAME="795"></A>Twelve miles from Augustodunum they saw before them Sacrovir and his army 
<A NAME="796"></A>in an open plain. His men in armour he had posted in the van, his light 
<A NAME="797"></A>infantry on the wings, and the half-armed in the rear. He himself rode 
<A NAME="798"></A>amid the foremost ranks on a splendid charger, reminding them of the ancient 
<A NAME="799"></A>glories of the Gauls, of the disasters they had inflicted on the Romans, 
<A NAME="800"></A>how grand would be the freedom of the victorious, how more intolerable 
<A NAME="801"></A>than ever the slavery of a second conquest.
<A NAME="802"></A><BR><BR>His words were brief and heard without exultation. For now the 
<A NAME="803"></A>legions in battle array were advancing, and the rabble of townsfolk who 
<A NAME="804"></A>knew nothing of war had their faculties of sight and hearing quite paralysed. 
<A NAME="805"></A>Silius, on the one hand, though confident hope took away any need for encouragement, 
<A NAME="806"></A>exclaimed again and again that it was a shame to the conquerors of Germany 
<A NAME="807"></A>to have to be led against Gauls, as against an enemy. "Only the other day 
<A NAME="808"></A>the rebel Turoni had been discomfited by a single cohort, the Treveri by 
<A NAME="809"></A>one cavalry squadron, the Sequani by a few companies of this very army. 
<A NAME="810"></A>Prove to these Aedui once for all that the more they abound in wealth and 
<A NAME="811"></A>luxury, the more unwarlike are they, but spare them when they 
<A NAME="812"></A>flee."
<A NAME="813"></A><BR><BR>Then there was a deafening cheer; the cavalry threw itself on the 
<A NAME="814"></A>flanks, and the infantry charged the van. On the wings there was but a 
<A NAME="815"></A>brief resistance. The men in mail were somewhat of an obstacle, as the 
<A NAME="816"></A>iron plates did not yield to javelins or swords; but our men, snatching 
<A NAME="817"></A>up hatchets and pickaxes, hacked at their bodies and their armour as if 
<A NAME="818"></A>they were battering a wall. Some beat down the unwieldy mass with pikes 
<A NAME="819"></A>and forked poles, and they were left lying on the ground, without an effort 
<A NAME="820"></A>to rise, like dead men. Sacrovir with his most trustworthy followers hurried 
<A NAME="821"></A>first to Augustodunum and then, from fear of being surrendered, to an adjacent 
<A NAME="822"></A>country house. There by his own hand he fell, and his comrades by mutually 
<A NAME="823"></A>inflicted wounds. The house was fired over their heads, and with it they 
<A NAME="824"></A>were all consumed.
<A NAME="825"></A><BR><BR>Then at last Tiberius informed the Senate by letter of the beginning 
<A NAME="826"></A>and completion of the war, without either taking away from or adding to 
<A NAME="827"></A>the truth, but ascribing the success to the loyalty and courage of his 
<A NAME="828"></A>generals, and to his own policy. He also gave the reasons why neither he 
<A NAME="829"></A>himself nor Drusus had gone to the war; he magnified the greatness of the 
<A NAME="830"></A>empire, and said it would be undignified for emperors, whenever there was 
<A NAME="831"></A>a commotion in one or two states, to quit the capital, the centre of all 
<A NAME="832"></A>government. Now, as he was not influenced by fear, he would go to examine 
<A NAME="833"></A>and settle matters.
<A NAME="834"></A><BR><BR>The Senate decreed vows for his safe return, with thanksgivings 
<A NAME="835"></A>and other appropriate ceremonies. Cornelius Dolabella alone, in endeavouring 
<A NAME="836"></A>to outdo the other Senators, went the length of a preposterous flattery 
<A NAME="837"></A>by proposing that he should enter Rome from Campania with an ovation. Thereupon 
<A NAME="838"></A>came a letter from the emperor, declaring that he was not so destitute 
<A NAME="839"></A>of renown as after having subdued the most savage nations and received 
<A NAME="840"></A>or refused so many triumphs in his youth, to covet now that he was old 
<A NAME="841"></A>an unmeaning honour for a tour in the neighbourhood of 
<A NAME="842"></A>Rome.
<A NAME="843"></A><BR><BR>About the same time he requested the Senate to let the death of 
<A NAME="844"></A>Sulpicius Quirinus be celebrated with a public funeral. With the old patrician 
<A NAME="845"></A>family of the Sulpicii this Quirinus, who was born in the town of Lanuvium, 
<A NAME="846"></A>was quite unconnected. An indefatigable soldier, he had by his zealous 
<A NAME="847"></A>services won the consulship under the Divine Augustus, and subsequently 
<A NAME="848"></A>the honours of a triumph for having stormed some fortresses of the Homonadenses 
<A NAME="849"></A>in Cilicia. He was also appointed adviser to Caius Caesar in the government 
<A NAME="850"></A>of Armenia, and had likewise paid court to Tiberius, who was then at Rhodes. 
<A NAME="851"></A>The emperor now made all this known to the Senate, and extolled the good 
<A NAME="852"></A>offices of Quirinus to himself, while he censured Marcus Lollius, whom 
<A NAME="853"></A>he charged with encouraging Caius Caesar in his perverse and quarrelsome 
<A NAME="854"></A>behaviour. But people generally had no pleasure in the memory of Quirinus, 
<A NAME="855"></A>because of the perils he had brought, as I have related, on Lepida, and 
<A NAME="856"></A>the meanness and dangerous power of his last years.
<A NAME="857"></A><BR><BR>At the close of the year, Caius Lutorius Priscus, a Roman knight, 
<A NAME="858"></A>who, after writing a popular poem bewailing the death of Germanicus, had 
<A NAME="859"></A>received a reward in money from the emperor, was fastened on by an informer, 
<A NAME="860"></A>and charged with having composed another during the illness of Drusus, 
<A NAME="861"></A>which, in the event of the prince's death, might be published with even 
<A NAME="862"></A>greater profit to himself. He had in his vanity read it in the house of 
<A NAME="863"></A>Publius Petronius before Vitellia, Petronius's mother-in-law, and several 
<A NAME="864"></A>ladies of rank. As soon as the accuser appeared, all but Vitellia were 
<A NAME="865"></A>frightened into giving evidence. She alone swore that she had heard not 
<A NAME="866"></A>a word. But those who criminated him fatally were rather believed, and 
<A NAME="867"></A>on the motion of Haterius Agrippa, the consul-elect, the last penalty was 
<A NAME="868"></A>invoked on the accused.
<A NAME="869"></A><BR><BR>Marcus Lepidus spoke against the sentence as follows:- "Senators, 
<A NAME="870"></A>if we look to the single fact of the infamous utterance with which Lutorius 
<A NAME="871"></A>has polluted his own mind and the ears of the public, neither dungeon nor 
<A NAME="872"></A>halter nor tortures fit for a slave would be punishment enough for him. 
<A NAME="873"></A>But though vice and wicked deeds have no limit, penalties and correctives 
<A NAME="874"></A>are moderated by the clemency of the sovereign and by the precedents of 
<A NAME="875"></A>your ancestors and yourselves. Folly differs from wickedness; evil words 
<A NAME="876"></A>from evil deeds, and thus there is room for a sentence by which this offence 
<A NAME="877"></A>may not go unpunished, while we shall have no cause to regret either leniency 
<A NAME="878"></A>or severity. Often have I heard our emperor complain when any one has anticipated 
<A NAME="879"></A>his mercy by a self-inflicted death. Lutorius's life is still safe; if 
<A NAME="880"></A>spared, he will be no danger to the State; if put to death, he will be 
<A NAME="881"></A>no warning to others. His productions are as empty and ephemeral as they 
<A NAME="882"></A>are replete with folly. Nothing serious or alarming is to be apprehended 
<A NAME="883"></A>from the man who is the betrayer of his own shame and works on the imaginations 
<A NAME="884"></A>not of men but of silly women. However, let him leave Rome, lose his property, 
<A NAME="885"></A>and be outlawed. That is my proposal, just as though he were convicted 
<A NAME="886"></A>under the law of treason."
<A NAME="887"></A><BR><BR>Only one of the ex-consuls, Rubellius Blandus, supported Lepidus. 
<A NAME="888"></A>The rest voted with Agrippa. Priscus was dragged off to prison and instantly 
<A NAME="889"></A>put to death. Of this Tiberius complained to the Senate with his usual 
<A NAME="890"></A>ambiguity, extolling their loyalty in so sharply avenging the very slightest 
<A NAME="891"></A>insults to the sovereign, though he deprecated such hasty punishment of 
<A NAME="892"></A>mere words, praising Lepidus and not censuring Agrippa. So the Senate passed 
<A NAME="893"></A>a resolution that their decrees should not be registered in the treasury 
<A NAME="894"></A>till nine days had expired, and so much respite was to be given to condemned 
<A NAME="895"></A>persons. Still the Senate had not liberty to alter their purpose, and lapse 
<A NAME="896"></A>of time never softened Tiberius.
<A NAME="897"></A><BR><BR>Caius Sulpicius and Didius Haterius were the next consuls. It was 
<A NAME="898"></A>a year free from commotions abroad, while at home stringent legislation 
<A NAME="899"></A>was apprehended against the luxury which had reached boundless excess in 
<A NAME="900"></A>everything on which wealth is lavished. Some expenses, though very serious, 
<A NAME="901"></A>were generally kept secret by a concealment of the real prices; but the 
<A NAME="902"></A>costly preparations for gluttony and dissipation were the theme of incessant 
<A NAME="903"></A>talk, and had suggested a fear that a prince who clung to oldfashioned 
<A NAME="904"></A>frugality would be too stern in his reforms. In fact, when the aedile Caius 
<A NAME="905"></A>Bibulus broached the topic, all his colleagues had pointed out that the 
<A NAME="906"></A>sumptuary laws were disregarded, that prohibited prices for household articles 
<A NAME="907"></A>were every day on the increase, and that moderate measures could not stop 
<A NAME="908"></A>the evil.
<A NAME="909"></A><BR><BR>The Senate on being consulted had, without handling the matter, 
<A NAME="910"></A>referred it to the emperor. Tiberius, after long considering whether such 
<A NAME="911"></A>reckless tastes could be repressed, whether the repression of them would 
<A NAME="912"></A>not be still more hurtful to the State, also, how undignified it would 
<A NAME="913"></A>be to meddle with what he could not succeed in, or what, if effected, would 
<A NAME="914"></A>necessitate the disgrace and infamy of men of distinction, at last addressed 
<A NAME="915"></A>a letter to the Senate to the following purport:-
<A NAME="916"></A><BR><BR>Perhaps in any other matter, Senators, it would be more convenient 
<A NAME="917"></A>that I should be consulted in your presence, and then state what I think 
<A NAME="918"></A>to be for the public good. In this debate it was better that my eyes should 
<A NAME="919"></A>not be on you, for while you were noting the anxious faces of individual 
<A NAME="920"></A>senators charged with shameful luxury, I too myself might observe them 
<A NAME="921"></A>and, as it were, detect them. Had those energetic men, our aediles, first 
<A NAME="922"></A>taken counsel with me, I do not know whether I should not have advised 
<A NAME="923"></A>them to let alone vices so strong and so matured, rather than merely attain 
<A NAME="924"></A>the result of publishing what are the corruptions with which we cannot 
<A NAME="925"></A>cope. They however have certainly done their duty, as I would wish all 
<A NAME="926"></A>other officials likewise to fulfil their parts. For myself, it is neither 
<A NAME="927"></A>seemly to keep silence nor is it easy to speak my mind, as I do not hold 
<A NAME="928"></A>the office of aedile, praetor, or consul. Something greater and loftier 
<A NAME="929"></A>is expected of a prince, and while everybody takes to himself the credit 
<A NAME="930"></A>of right policy, one alone has to bear the odium of every person's failures. 
<A NAME="931"></A>For what am I first to begin with restraining and cutting down to the old 
<A NAME="932"></A>standard? The vast dimensions of country houses? The number of slaves of 
<A NAME="933"></A>every nationality? The masses of silver and gold? The marvels in bronze 
<A NAME="934"></A>and painting? The apparel worn indiscriminately by both sexes, or that 
<A NAME="935"></A>peculiar luxury of women which, for the sake of jewels, diverts our wealth 
<A NAME="936"></A>to strange or hostile nations?
<A NAME="937"></A><BR><BR>I am not unaware that people at entertainments and social gatherings 
<A NAME="938"></A>condemn all this and demand some restriction. But if a law were to be passed 
<A NAME="939"></A>and a penalty imposed, those very same persons will cry out that the State 
<A NAME="940"></A>is revolutionised, that ruin is plotted against all our most brilliant 
<A NAME="941"></A>fashion, that not a citizen is safe from incrimination. Yet as even bodily 
<A NAME="942"></A>disorders of long standing and growth can be checked only by sharp and 
<A NAME="943"></A>painful treatment, so the fever of a diseased mind, itself polluted and 
<A NAME="944"></A>a pollution to others, can be quenched only by remedies as strong as the 
<A NAME="945"></A>passions which inflame it. Of the many laws devised by our ancestors, of 
<A NAME="946"></A>the many passed by the Divine Augustus, the first have been forgotten, 
<A NAME="947"></A>while his (all the more to our disgrace) have become obsolete through contempt, 
<A NAME="948"></A>and this has made luxury bolder than ever. The truth is, that when one 
<A NAME="949"></A>craves something not yet forbidden, there is a fear that it may be forbidden; 
<A NAME="950"></A>but when people once transgress prohibitions with impunity, there is no 
<A NAME="951"></A>longer any fear or any shame.
<A NAME="952"></A><BR><BR>Why then in old times was economy in the ascendant? Because every 
<A NAME="953"></A>one practised self-control; because we were all members of one city. Nor 
<A NAME="954"></A>even afterwards had we the same temptations, while our dominion was confined 
<A NAME="955"></A>to Italy. Victories over the foreigner taught us how to waste the substance 
<A NAME="956"></A>of others; victories over ourselves, how to squander our own. What a paltry 
<A NAME="957"></A>matter is this of which the aediles are reminding us! What a mere trifle 
<A NAME="958"></A>if you look at everything else! No one represents to the Senate that Italy 
<A NAME="959"></A>requires supplies from abroad, and that the very existence of the people 
<A NAME="960"></A>of Rome is daily at the mercy of uncertain waves and storms. And unless 
<A NAME="961"></A>masters, slaves, and estates have the resources of the provinces as their 
<A NAME="962"></A>mainstay, our shrubberies, forsooth, and our country houses will have to 
<A NAME="963"></A>support us.
<A NAME="964"></A><BR><BR>Such, Senators, are the anxieties which the prince has to sustain, 
<A NAME="965"></A>and the neglect of them will be utter ruin to the State. The cure for other 
<A NAME="966"></A>evils must be sought in our own hearts. Let us be led to amendment, the 
<A NAME="967"></A>poor by constraint, the rich by satiety. Or if any of our officials give 
<A NAME="968"></A>promise of such energy and strictness as can stem the corruption, I praise 
<A NAME="969"></A>the man, and I confess that I am relieved of a portion of my burdens. But 
<A NAME="970"></A>if they wish to denounce vice, and when they have gained credit for so 
<A NAME="971"></A>doing they arouse resentments and leave them to me, be assured, Senators, 
<A NAME="972"></A>that I too am by no means eager to incur enmities, and though for the public 
<A NAME="973"></A>good I encounter formidable and often unjust enmities, yet I have a right 
<A NAME="974"></A>to decline such as are unmeaning and purposeless and will be of use neither 
<A NAME="975"></A>to myself nor to you.
<A NAME="976"></A><BR><BR>When they had heard the emperor's letter, the aediles were excused 
<A NAME="977"></A>from so anxious a task, and that luxury of the table which from the close 
<A NAME="978"></A>of the war ended at Actium to the armed revolution in which Servius Galba 
<A NAME="979"></A>rose to empire, had been practised with profuse expenditure, gradually 
<A NAME="980"></A>went out of fashion. It is as well that I should trace the causes of this 
<A NAME="981"></A>change.
<A NAME="982"></A><BR><BR>Formerly rich or highly distinguished noble families often sank 
<A NAME="983"></A>into ruin from a passion for splendour. Even then men were still at liberty 
<A NAME="984"></A>to court and be courted by the city populace, by our allies and by foreign 
<A NAME="985"></A>princes, and every one who from his wealth, his mansion and his establishment 
<A NAME="986"></A>was conspicuously grand, gained too proportionate lustre by his name and 
<A NAME="987"></A>his numerous clientele. After the savage massacres in which greatness of 
<A NAME="988"></A>renown was fatal, the survivors turned to wiser ways. The new men who were 
<A NAME="989"></A>often admitted into the Senate from the towns, colonies and even the provinces, 
<A NAME="990"></A>introduced their household thrift, and though many of them by good luck 
<A NAME="991"></A>or energy attained an old age of wealth, still their former tastes remained. 
<A NAME="992"></A>But the chief encourager of strict manners was Vespasian, himself old-fashioned 
<A NAME="993"></A>both in his dress and diet. Henceforth a respectful feeling towards the 
<A NAME="994"></A>prince and a love of emulation proved more efficacious than legal penalties 
<A NAME="995"></A>or terrors. Or possibly there is in all things a kind of cycle, and there 
<A NAME="996"></A>may be moral revolutions just as there are changes of seasons. Nor was 
<A NAME="997"></A>everything better in the past, but our own age too has produced many specimens 
<A NAME="998"></A>of excellence and culture for posterity to imitate. May we still keep up 
<A NAME="999"></A>with our ancestors a rivalry in all that is honourable!
<A NAME="1000"></A><BR><BR>Tiberius having gained credit for forbearance by the check he had 
<A NAME="1001"></A>given to the growing terror of the informers, wrote a letter to the Senate 
<A NAME="1002"></A>requesting the tribunitian power for Drusus. This was a phrase which Augustus 
<A NAME="1003"></A>devised as a designation of supremacy, so that without assuming the name 
<A NAME="1004"></A>of king or dictator he might have some title to mark his elevation above 
<A NAME="1005"></A>all other authority. He then chose Marcus Agrippa to be his associate in 
<A NAME="1006"></A>this power, and on Agrippa's death, Tiberius Nero, that there might be 
<A NAME="1007"></A>no uncertainty as to the succession. In this manner he thought to check 
<A NAME="1008"></A>the perverse ambition of others, while he had confidence in Nero's moderation 
<A NAME="1009"></A>and in his own greatness.
<A NAME="1010"></A><BR><BR>Following this precedent, Tiberius now placed Drusus next to the 
<A NAME="1011"></A>throne, though while Germanicus was alive he had maintained an impartial 
<A NAME="1012"></A>attitude towards the two princes. However in the beginning of his letter 
<A NAME="1013"></A>he implored heaven to prosper his plans on behalf of the State, and then 
<A NAME="1014"></A>added a few remarks, without falsehood or exaggeration, on the character 
<A NAME="1015"></A>of the young prince. He had, he reminded them, a wife and three children, 
<A NAME="1016"></A>and his age was the same as that at which he had himself been formerly 
<A NAME="1017"></A>summoned by the Divine Augustus to undertake this duty. Nor was it a precipitate 
<A NAME="1018"></A>step; it was only after an experience of eight years, after having quelled 
<A NAME="1019"></A>mutinies and settled wars, after a triumph and two consulships, that he 
<A NAME="1020"></A>was adopted as a partner in trials already familiar to 
<A NAME="1021"></A>him.
<A NAME="1022"></A><BR><BR>The senators had anticipated this message and hence their flattery 
<A NAME="1023"></A>was the more elaborate. But they could devise nothing but voting statues 
<A NAME="1024"></A>of the two princes, shrines to certain deities, temples, arches and the 
<A NAME="1025"></A>usual routine, except that Marcus Silanus sought to honour the princes 
<A NAME="1026"></A>by a slur on the consulate, and proposed that on all monuments, public 
<A NAME="1027"></A>or private, should be inscribed, to mark the date, the names, not of the 
<A NAME="1028"></A>consuls, but of those who were holding the tribunitian power. Quintus Haterius, 
<A NAME="1029"></A>when he brought forward a motion that the decrees passed that day should 
<A NAME="1030"></A>be set up in the Senate House in letters of gold, was laughed at as an 
<A NAME="1031"></A>old dotard, who would get nothing but infamy out of such utterly loathsome 
<A NAME="1032"></A>sycophancy.
<A NAME="1033"></A><BR><BR>Meantime Junius Blaesus received an extension of his government 
<A NAME="1034"></A>of Africa, and Servius Maluginensis, the priest of Jupiter, demanded to 
<A NAME="1035"></A>have Asia allotted to him. "It was," he asserted, "a popular error that 
<A NAME="1036"></A>it was not lawful for the priests of Jupiter to leave Italy; in fact, his 
<A NAME="1037"></A>own legal position differed not from that of the priests of Mars and of 
<A NAME="1038"></A>Quirinus. If these latter had provinces allotted to them, why was it forbidden 
<A NAME="1039"></A>to the priests of Jupiter? There were no resolutions of the people or anything 
<A NAME="1040"></A>to be found in the books of ceremonies on the subject. Pontiffs had often 
<A NAME="1041"></A>performed the rites to Jupiter when his priest was hindered by illness 
<A NAME="1042"></A>or by public duty. For seventy-five years after the suicide of Cornelius 
<A NAME="1043"></A>Merula no successor to his office had been appointed; yet religious rites 
<A NAME="1044"></A>had not ceased. If during so many years it was possible for there to be 
<A NAME="1045"></A>no appointment without any prejudice to religion, with what comparative 
<A NAME="1046"></A>ease might he be absent for one year's proconsulate? That these priests 
<A NAME="1047"></A>in former days were prohibited by the pontiff from going into the provinces, 
<A NAME="1048"></A>was the result of private feuds. Now, thank heaven, the supreme pontiff 
<A NAME="1049"></A>was also the supreme man, and was influenced by no rivalry, hatred or personal 
<A NAME="1050"></A>feeling."
<A NAME="1051"></A><BR><BR>As the augur Lentulus and others argued on various grounds against 
<A NAME="1052"></A>this view, the result was that they awaited the decision of the supreme 
<A NAME="1053"></A>pontiff. Tiberius deferred any investigation into the priest's legal position, 
<A NAME="1054"></A>but he modified the ceremonies which had been decreed in honour of Drusus's 
<A NAME="1055"></A>tribunitian power with special censure on the extravagance of the proposed 
<A NAME="1056"></A>inscription in gold, so contrary to national usage. Letters also from Drusus 
<A NAME="1057"></A>were read, which, though studiously modest in expression, were taken to 
<A NAME="1058"></A>be extremely supercilious. "We have fallen so low," people said, "that 
<A NAME="1059"></A>even a mere youth who has received so high an honour does not go as a worshipper 
<A NAME="1060"></A>to the city's gods, does not enter the Senate, does not so much as take 
<A NAME="1061"></A>the auspices on his country's soil. There is a war, forsooth, or he is 
<A NAME="1062"></A>kept from us in some remote part of the world. Why, at this very moment, 
<A NAME="1063"></A>he is on a tour amid the shores and lakes of Campania. Such is the training 
<A NAME="1064"></A>of the future ruler of mankind; such the lesson he first learns from his 
<A NAME="1065"></A>father's counsels. An aged emperor may indeed shrink from the citizen's 
<A NAME="1066"></A>gaze, and plead the weariness of declining years and the toils of the past. 
<A NAME="1067"></A>But, as for Drusus, what can be his hindrance but pride?"
<A NAME="1068"></A><BR><BR>Tiberius meantime, while securing to himself the substance of imperial 
<A NAME="1069"></A>power, allowed the Senate some shadow of its old constitution by referring 
<A NAME="1070"></A>to its investigation certain demands of the provinces. In the Greek cities 
<A NAME="1071"></A>license and impunity in establishing sanctuaries were on the increase. 
<A NAME="1072"></A>Temples were thronged with the vilest of the slaves; the same refuge screened 
<A NAME="1073"></A>the debtor against his creditor, as well as men suspected of capital offences. 
<A NAME="1074"></A>No authority was strong enough to check the turbulence of a people which 
<A NAME="1075"></A>protected the crimes of men as much as the worship of the 
<A NAME="1076"></A>gods.
<A NAME="1077"></A><BR><BR>It was accordingly decided that the different states were to send 
<A NAME="1078"></A>their charters and envoys to Rome. Some voluntarily relinquished privileges 
<A NAME="1079"></A>which they had groundlessly usurped; many trusted to old superstitions, 
<A NAME="1080"></A>or to their services to the Roman people. It was a grand spectacle on that 
<A NAME="1081"></A>day, when the Senate examined grants made by our ancestors, treaties with 
<A NAME="1082"></A>allies, even decrees of kings who had flourished before Rome's ascendancy, 
<A NAME="1083"></A>and the forms of worship of the very deities, with full liberty as in former 
<A NAME="1084"></A>days, to ratify or to alter.
<A NAME="1085"></A><BR><BR>First of all came the people of Ephesus. They declared that Diana 
<A NAME="1086"></A>and Apollo were not born at Delos, as was the vulgar belief. They had in 
<A NAME="1087"></A>their own country a river Cenchrius, a grove Ortygia, where Latona, as 
<A NAME="
