<A NAME="10"></A>September - December, A.D. 69
<A NAME="11"></A><BR><BR>Under happier auspices and in a more loyal spirit the Flavianist 
<A NAME="12"></A>leaders were discussing the plans of the campaign. They had assembled at 
<A NAME="13"></A>Petovio, the winter-quarters of the 13th legion. There they debated, whether 
<A NAME="14"></A>they should blockade the passes of the Pannonian Alps till the whole strength 
<A NAME="15"></A>of their party should be gathered in their rear, or whether it would be 
<A NAME="16"></A>the more vigorous policy to close with the enemy, and to contend for the 
<A NAME="17"></A>possession of Italy. Those who thought it advisable to wait for reinforcements, 
<A NAME="18"></A>and to protract the campaign, dwelt on the strength and reputation of the 
<A NAME="19"></A>German legions. "Vitellius," they said, "has now joined them with the flower 
<A NAME="20"></A>of the British army. Our numbers are not even equal to those of the legions 
<A NAME="21"></A>whom they lately defeated; and the conquered, let them talk as fiercely 
<A NAME="22"></A>as they will, lose something of their courage. But, if we occupy meanwhile 
<A NAME="23"></A>the passes of the Alps, Mucianus will come up with the forces of the East. 
<A NAME="24"></A>Vespasian has in addition the command of the sea, his fleets, and provinces 
<A NAME="25"></A>loyal to his cause, in which he may collect the vast materials for what 
<A NAME="26"></A>may be called another war. A salutary delay will bring us new forces, while 
<A NAME="27"></A>we shall lose nothing of what we have."
<A NAME="28"></A><BR><BR>In answer to this, Antonius Primus, who was the most energetic 
<A NAME="29"></A>promoter of the war, declared that prompt action would be advantageous 
<A NAME="30"></A>to themselves, and fatal to Vitellius. "Supineness," he said, "rather than 
<A NAME="31"></A>confidence has grown upon the conquerors. They are not even kept under 
<A NAME="32"></A>arms or within camps. In every town of Italy, sunk in sloth, formidable 
<A NAME="33"></A>only to their entertainers, they have drunk of unaccustomed pleasures with 
<A NAME="34"></A>an eagerness equal to the rudeness of their former life. They have been 
<A NAME="35"></A>emasculated by the circus, the theatre, and the allurements of the capital, 
<A NAME="36"></A>or they are worn out with sickness. Yet even to these men, if you give 
<A NAME="37"></A>them time, their old vigour will return with the preparation for war. Germany, 
<A NAME="38"></A>whence their strength is drawn, is faraway; Britain is separated only by 
<A NAME="39"></A>a strait; the provinces of Gaul and Spain are near; on either side they 
<A NAME="40"></A>can find troops, horses, tribute; they have Italy itself, and the resources 
<A NAME="41"></A>of the capital, and, should they choose themselves to take the offensive, 
<A NAME="42"></A>they have two fleets, and the Illyrian sea open to them. What good then 
<A NAME="43"></A>will our mountain-passes do us? What will be the use of having protracted 
<A NAME="44"></A>the war into another summer? Where are we to find in the meanwhile money 
<A NAME="45"></A>and supplies? Why not rather avail ourselves of the fact that the legions 
<A NAME="46"></A>of Pannonia, which were cheated rather than vanquished, are hastening to 
<A NAME="47"></A>rise again for vengeance, and that the armies of Moesia have brought us 
<A NAME="48"></A>their unimpaired strength? If you reckon the number of soldiers, rather 
<A NAME="49"></A>than that of legions, we have greater strength, and no vices, for our very 
<A NAME="50"></A>humiliation has been most helpful to our discipline. As for the cavalry, 
<A NAME="51"></A>they were not vanquished even on that day; though the fortune of war was 
<A NAME="52"></A>against them, they penetrated the Vitellianist lines. Two squadrons of 
<A NAME="53"></A>Moesian and Pannonian cavalry then broke through the enemy; now the united 
<A NAME="54"></A>standards of sixteen squadrons will bury and overwhelm with the crash and 
<A NAME="55"></A>din and storm of their onset these horses and horsemen that have forgotten 
<A NAME="56"></A>how to fight. Unless any one hinders me, I who suggest will execute the 
<A NAME="57"></A>plan. You, whose fortune never suffered a reverse, may keep back the legions; 
<A NAME="58"></A>the light cohorts will be enough for me. Before long you will hear that 
<A NAME="59"></A>Italy has been opened, and the power of Vitellius shaken. You will be delighted 
<A NAME="60"></A>to follow, and to tread in the footsteps of victory."
<A NAME="61"></A><BR><BR>With flashing eyes, and in the fierce tones that might be most 
<A NAME="62"></A>widely heard (for the centurions and some of the common soldiers had intruded 
<A NAME="63"></A>themselves into the deliberations), he poured out such a torrent of these 
<A NAME="64"></A>and similar words, that he carried away even the cautious and prudent, 
<A NAME="65"></A>while the general voice of the multitude extolled him as the one man, the 
<A NAME="66"></A>one general in the army, and spurned the inaction of the others. He had 
<A NAME="67"></A>raised this reputation for himself at the very first assembly, when, after 
<A NAME="68"></A>Vespasian's letters had been read, he had not, like many, used ambiguous 
<A NAME="69"></A>language, on which he might put this or that construction as might serve 
<A NAME="70"></A>his purpose. It was seen that he openly committed himself to the cause, 
<A NAME="71"></A>and he had therefore greater weight with the soldiers, as being associated 
<A NAME="72"></A>with them in what was either their crime or their glory.
<A NAME="73"></A><BR><BR>Next to Primus in influence was Cornelius Fuscus, the procurator. 
<A NAME="74"></A>He also had been accustomed to inveigh mercilessly against Vitellius, and 
<A NAME="75"></A>had thus left himself no hope in the event of defeat. T. Ampius Flavianus, 
<A NAME="76"></A>disposed to caution by natural temperament and advanced years, excited 
<A NAME="77"></A>in the soldiers a suspicion that he still remembered his relationship to 
<A NAME="78"></A>Vitellius; and as he had fled when the movement in the legions began, and 
<A NAME="79"></A>had then voluntarily returned, it was believed that he had sought an opportunity 
<A NAME="80"></A>for treachery. Flavianus indeed had left Pannonia, and had entered Italy, 
<A NAME="81"></A>and was out of the way of danger, when his desire for revolution urged 
<A NAME="82"></A>him to resume the title of Legate, and to take part in the civil strife. 
<A NAME="83"></A>Cornelius Fuscus had advised him to this course, not that he needed the 
<A NAME="84"></A>talents of Flavianus, but wishing that a consular name might clothe with 
<A NAME="85"></A>its high prestige the very first movements of the party.
<A NAME="86"></A><BR><BR>Still, that the passage into Italy might be safe and advantageous, 
<A NAME="87"></A>directions were sent to Aponius Saturninus to hasten up with the armies 
<A NAME="88"></A>of Moesia. That the provinces might not be exposed without defence to the 
<A NAME="89"></A>barbarian tribes, the princes of the Sarmatae Iazyges, who had in their 
<A NAME="90"></A>hands the government of that nation, were enrolled in the army. These chiefs 
<A NAME="91"></A>also offered the service of their people, and its force of cavalry, their 
<A NAME="92"></A>only effective troops; but the offer was declined, lest in the midst of 
<A NAME="93"></A>civil strife they should attempt some hostile enterprise, or, influenced 
<A NAME="94"></A>by higher offers from other quarters, should cast off all sense of right 
<A NAME="95"></A>and duty. Sido and Italicus, kings of the Suevi, were brought over to the 
<A NAME="96"></A>cause. Their loyalty to the Roman people was of long standing, and their 
<A NAME="97"></A>nation was more faithful than the other to any trust reposed in them. On 
<A NAME="98"></A>the flank of the army were posted some auxiliaries, for Rhaetia was hostile, 
<A NAME="99"></A>Portius Septimius, the procurator, remaining incorruptibly faithful to 
<A NAME="100"></A>Vitellius. Accordingly, Sextilius Felix with Aurius' Horse, eight cohorts, 
<A NAME="101"></A>and the native levies of Noricum, was sent to occupy the bank of the river 
<A NAME="102"></A>Aenus, which flows between Rhaetia and Noricum. Neither hazarded an engagement, 
<A NAME="103"></A>and the fate of the two parties was decided elsewhere.
<A NAME="104"></A><BR><BR>Antonius, as he hurried with the veteran soldiers of the cohorts 
<A NAME="105"></A>and part of the cavalry to invade Italy, was accompanied by Arrius Varus, 
<A NAME="106"></A>an energetic soldier. Service under Corbulo, and successes in Armenia, 
<A NAME="107"></A>had gained for him this reputation; yet it was generally said, that in 
<A NAME="108"></A>secret conversations with Nero he had calumniated Corbulo's high qualities. 
<A NAME="109"></A>The favour thus infamously acquired made him a centurion of the first rank, 
<A NAME="110"></A>yet the ill-gotten prosperity of the moment afterwards turned to his destruction. 
<A NAME="111"></A>Primus and Varus, having occupied Aquileia, were joyfully welcomed in the 
<A NAME="112"></A>neighbourhood, and in the towns of Opitergium and Altinum. At Altinum a 
<A NAME="113"></A>force was left to oppose the Ravenna fleet, the defection of which from 
<A NAME="114"></A>Vitellius was not yet known. They next attached to their party Patavium 
<A NAME="115"></A>and Ateste. There they learnt that three cohorts, belonging to Vitellius, 
<A NAME="116"></A>and the Sebonian Horse had taken up a position at the Forum Alieni, where 
<A NAME="117"></A>they had thrown a bridge across the river. It was determined to seize the 
<A NAME="118"></A>opportunity of attacking this force, unprepared as it was; for this fact 
<A NAME="119"></A>had likewise been communicated. Coming upon them at dawn, they killed many 
<A NAME="120"></A>before they could arm. Orders had been given to slay but few, and to constrain 
<A NAME="121"></A>the rest by fear to transfer their allegiance. Some indeed at once surrendered, 
<A NAME="122"></A>but the greater part broke down the bridge, and thus cut off the advance 
<A NAME="123"></A>of the pursuing enemy.
<A NAME="124"></A><BR><BR>When this success became known, two legions, the seventh (Galba's) 
<A NAME="125"></A>and the eighteenth (the Gemina), finding the campaign opening in favour 
<A NAME="126"></A>of the Flavianists, repaired with alacrity to Patavium under the command 
<A NAME="127"></A>of Vedius Aquila the legate. A few days were there taken for rest, and 
<A NAME="128"></A>Minucius Justus, prefect of the camp in the 7th legion, who ruled with 
<A NAME="129"></A>more strictness than a civil war will permit, was withdrawn from the exasperated 
<A NAME="130"></A>soldiery, and sent to Vespasian. An act that had been long desired was 
<A NAME="131"></A>taken by a flattering construction for more than it was worth, when Antonius 
<A NAME="132"></A>gave orders that the statues of Galba, which had been thrown down during 
<A NAME="133"></A>the troubles of the times, should be restored in all the towns. It would, 
<A NAME="134"></A>he supposed, reflect honour on the cause, if it were thought that they 
<A NAME="135"></A>had been friendly to Galba's rule, and that his party was again rising 
<A NAME="136"></A>into strength.
<A NAME="137"></A><BR><BR>The next question was, what place should be selected as the seat 
<A NAME="138"></A>of war. Verona seemed the most eligible, surrounded as it was with open 
<A NAME="139"></A>plains, suitable for the action of cavalry, in which they were very strong. 
<A NAME="140"></A>At the same time it was thought that in wresting from Vitellius a colony 
<A NAME="141"></A>so rich in resources there would be both profit and glory. They secured 
<A NAME="142"></A>Vicetia by simply passing through it. Though in itself a small gain, for 
<A NAME="143"></A>the town is but of moderate strength, it was considered an important advantage 
<A NAME="144"></A>when they reflected that in this town Caecina was born, and that the general 
<A NAME="145"></A>of the enemy had lost his native place. The people of Verona were a valuable 
<A NAME="146"></A>aid; they served the cause by the example of their zeal and by their wealth, 
<A NAME="147"></A>and the army thus occupied a position between Rhaetia and the Julian Alps. 
<A NAME="148"></A>It was to cut off all passage at this point from the armies of Germany 
<A NAME="149"></A>that they had barred this route. All this was done either without the knowledge, 
<A NAME="150"></A>or against the commands of Vespasian. He gave orders that the army should 
<A NAME="151"></A>halt at Aquileia and there await Mucianus; and these orders he supported 
<A NAME="152"></A>by the argument, that as Aegypt, which commanded the corn supplies, and 
<A NAME="153"></A>the revenues of the wealthiest provinces were in his hands, the army of 
<A NAME="154"></A>Vitellius would be compelled to capitulate from the want of pay and provisions. 
<A NAME="155"></A>Mucianus in frequent letters advised the same policy; a victory that should 
<A NAME="156"></A>cost neither blood nor tears, and other objects of the kind, were his pretexts; 
<A NAME="157"></A>but in truth he was greedy of glory, and anxious to keep the whole credit 
<A NAME="158"></A>of the war to himself. Owing, however, to the vast distances, the advice 
<A NAME="159"></A>came only after the matter was decided.
<A NAME="160"></A><BR><BR>Then Antonius by a sudden movement fell upon the outposts of the 
<A NAME="161"></A>enemy, and made trial of their courage in a slight skirmish, the combatants 
<A NAME="162"></A>separating on equal terms. Soon afterwards, Caecina strongly fortified 
<A NAME="163"></A>a camp between Hostilia, a village belonging to Verona, and the marshes 
<A NAME="164"></A>of the river Tartarus, where his position was secure, as his rear was covered 
<A NAME="165"></A>by the river, and his flank by intervening marshes. Had he only been loyal, 
<A NAME="166"></A>those two legions, which had not been joined by the army of Moesia, might 
<A NAME="167"></A>have been crushed by the united strength of the Vitellianists, or driven 
<A NAME="168"></A>back and compelled to evacuate Italy in a disgraceful retreat. Caecina, 
<A NAME="169"></A>however, by various delays betrayed to the enemy the early opportunities 
<A NAME="170"></A>of the campaign, assailing by letters those whom it was easy to drive out 
<A NAME="171"></A>by force of arms, until by his envoys he settled the conditions of his 
<A NAME="172"></A>treachery. In this interval Aponius Saturninus came up with the 7th legion 
<A NAME="173"></A>(Claudius'). This legion was commanded by the tribune Vipstanus Messalla, 
<A NAME="174"></A>a man of illustrious family, himself highly distinguished, the only man 
<A NAME="175"></A>who had brought into that conflict an honest purpose. To this army, which 
<A NAME="176"></A>was far from equalling the forces of Vitellius (it in fact consisted of 
<A NAME="177"></A>three legions), Caecina despatched a letter reproaching them with rashness 
<A NAME="178"></A>in again drawing the sword in a vanquished cause. At the same time he extolled 
<A NAME="179"></A>the valour of the German army; of Vitellius he made but some slight and 
<A NAME="180"></A>common-place mention without any abuse of Vespasian. Certainly he said 
<A NAME="181"></A>nothing which could either seduce or terrify the enemy. The leaders of 
<A NAME="182"></A>the Flavianist party, omitting all apology for their former fortune, at 
<A NAME="183"></A>once took up a tone of high praise of Vespasian, of confidence in their 
<A NAME="184"></A>cause, of security as to their army, and of hostility to Vitellius, while 
<A NAME="185"></A>hopes were held out to the tribunes and centurions of retaining the privileges 
<A NAME="186"></A>which Vitellius had granted them, and Caecina was himself encouraged in 
<A NAME="187"></A>no ambiguous terms to change sides. These letters read to the assembled 
<A NAME="188"></A>army increased their confidence; for Caecina had written in a humble strain, 
<A NAME="189"></A>as if he feared to offend Vespasian, while their own generals had used 
<A NAME="190"></A>contemptuous language, meant, it would seem, to insult 
<A NAME="191"></A>Vitellius.
<A NAME="192"></A><BR><BR>On the subsequent arrival of two legions, the third commanded by 
<A NAME="193"></A>Dillius Aponianus, the eighth by Numisius Lupus, it was resolved to make 
<A NAME="194"></A>a demonstration of their strength, and to surround Verona with military 
<A NAME="195"></A>lines. It so happened that Galba's legion had had their work allotted to 
<A NAME="196"></A>them on that side the lines which faced the enemy, and that some of the 
<A NAME="197"></A>allied cavalry appearing in the distance were taken for the enemy, and 
<A NAME="198"></A>excited a groundless panic. They flew to arms, and as the rage of the soldiers 
<A NAME="199"></A>at the supposed treachery fell upon T. Ampius Flavianus, not from any proof 
<A NAME="200"></A>of his guilt, but because he had been long unpopular, they clamoured for 
<A NAME="201"></A>his death in a very whirlwind of passion, vociferating that he was the 
<A NAME="202"></A>kinsman of Vitellius, that he had betrayed Otho, that he had embezzled 
<A NAME="203"></A>the donative. He could get no opportunity of defending himself, even though 
<A NAME="204"></A>he stretched out his hands in entreaty, repeatedly prostrating himself 
<A NAME="205"></A>on the ground, his garments torn, his breast and features convulsed with 
<A NAME="206"></A>sobs. This very conduct provoked afresh these furious men, for fear so 
<A NAME="207"></A>excessive seemed to argue a consciousness of guilt. Aponius was clamoured 
<A NAME="208"></A>down by the shouts of the soldiers, when he attempted to address them; 
<A NAME="209"></A>every one else was repulsed with noisy cries. To Antonius alone the soldiers' 
<A NAME="210"></A>ears were open; for he had eloquence, the art of soothing an angry crowd, 
<A NAME="211"></A>and personal influence. As the mutiny grew fiercer, and the soldiers went 
<A NAME="212"></A>on from abuse and taunts to use their hands and their weapons, he ordered 
<A NAME="213"></A>that Flavianus should be put in irons. The soldiers saw what a mockery 
<A NAME="214"></A>it was, and pushing aside those who were guarding the tribunal, were about 
<A NAME="215"></A>to commit the most outrageous violence. Antonius threw himself in the way 
<A NAME="216"></A>with his sword drawn, protesting that he would die either by the soldiers' 
<A NAME="217"></A>hands or by his own; whenever he saw any one who was known to him, or who 
<A NAME="218"></A>was distinguished by any military decoration, he summoned him by name to 
<A NAME="219"></A>his assistance. Then he turned to the standards, and prayed to the gods 
<A NAME="220"></A>of war, that they would inspire the armies of the enemy, rather than his 
<A NAME="221"></A>own, with such madness and such strife. So the mutiny began to abate, and 
<A NAME="222"></A>at the close of the day the men dispersed to their tents. The same night 
<A NAME="223"></A>Flavianus set out, and being met by letters from Vespasian, was relieved 
<A NAME="224"></A>from his perilous position.
<A NAME="225"></A><BR><BR>The legions had caught the infection of mutiny, and next assailed 
<A NAME="226"></A>Aponius Saturnius, legate of the army of Moesia, this time the more furiously 
<A NAME="227"></A>because their rage broke out, not as before, when they were wearied with 
<A NAME="228"></A>labour and military toils, but at mid-day. Some letters had been published, 
<A NAME="229"></A>which Saturninus was believed to have written to Vitellius. If once they 
<A NAME="230"></A>had emulated each other in valour and obedience, so now there was a rivalry 
<A NAME="231"></A>in insubordination and insolence, till they clamoured as violently for 
<A NAME="232"></A>the execution of Aponius as they had for that of Flavianus. The legions 
<A NAME="233"></A>of Moesia recalled how they had aided the vengeance of the Pannonian army, 
<A NAME="234"></A>while the soldiers of Pannonia, as if they were absolved by the mutiny 
<A NAME="235"></A>of others, took a delight in repeating their fault. They hastened to the 
<A NAME="236"></A>gardens in which Saturninus was passing his time, and it was not the efforts 
<A NAME="237"></A>of Primus Antonius, Aponianus, and Messalla, though they exerted themselves 
<A NAME="238"></A>to the uttermost, that saved him, so much as the obscurity of the hiding-place 
<A NAME="239"></A>in which he concealed himself, for he was hidden in the furnace of some 
<A NAME="240"></A>baths that happened to be out of use. In a short time he gave up his lictors, 
<A NAME="241"></A>and retired to Patavium. After the departure of the two men of consular 
<A NAME="242"></A>rank, all power and authority over the two armies centred in Antonius alone, 
<A NAME="243"></A>his colleagues giving way to him, and the soldiers being strongly biased 
<A NAME="244"></A>in his favour. There were those who believed that both these mutinies were 
<A NAME="245"></A>set on foot by the intrigues of Antonius, in order that he might engross 
<A NAME="246"></A>all the prizes of the war.
<A NAME="247"></A><BR><BR>Nor indeed was there less restlessness among the partisans of Vitellius, 
<A NAME="248"></A>who were distracted by yet more fatal dissensions, springing, not from 
<A NAME="249"></A>the suspicions of the common men, but from the treachery of the generals. 
<A NAME="250"></A>Lucilius Bassus, prefect of the Ravenna fleet, finding that the troops 
<A NAME="251"></A>wavered in purpose, from the fact that many were natives of Dalmatia and 
<A NAME="252"></A>Pannonia, provinces held for Vespasian, had attached them to the Flavianist 
<A NAME="253"></A>party. The night-time was chosen for accomplishing the treason, because 
<A NAME="254"></A>then, unknown to all the rest, the ringleaders alone might assemble at 
<A NAME="255"></A>head-quarters. Bassus, moved by shame, or perhaps by fear, awaited the 
<A NAME="256"></A>issue in his house. The captains of the triremes rushed with a great outcry 
<A NAME="257"></A>on the images of Vitellius; a few, who attempted to resist, were cut down; 
<A NAME="258"></A>the great majority, with the usual love of change, were ready to join Vespasian. 
<A NAME="259"></A>Then Bassus came forward and openly sanctioned the movement. The fleet 
<A NAME="260"></A>appointed Cornelius Fuscus to be prefect, and he hastened to join them. 
<A NAME="261"></A>Lucilius was put under honourable arrest, and conveyed as far as Adria 
<A NAME="262"></A>by the Liburnian ships; there he was thrown into prison by Vivennius Rufinus, 
<A NAME="263"></A>prefect of a squadron of cavalry, which was there in garrison. His chains, 
<A NAME="264"></A>however, were immediately struck off on the interference of Hormus, one 
<A NAME="265"></A>of the Emperor's freedmen, for he too ranked among the 
<A NAME="266"></A>generals.
<A NAME="267"></A><BR><BR>On the revolt of the fleet becoming known, Caecina called together 
<A NAME="268"></A>to head-quarters, which he purposely selected as being the most retired 
<A NAME="269"></A>part of the camp, the chief centurions and some few soldiers, while the 
<A NAME="270"></A>rest were dispersed on various military duties. Then he extolled the valour 
<A NAME="271"></A>of Vespasian, and the strength of his party; he told them that the fleet 
<A NAME="272"></A>had changed sides, that they were straitened for supplies, that Gaul and 
<A NAME="273"></A>Spain were against them, that in the capital there was nothing on which 
<A NAME="274"></A>to rely, thus making the worst of everything that concerned Vitellius. 
<A NAME="275"></A>Then, the conspirators present setting the example, and the rest being 
<A NAME="276"></A>paralysed by the strangeness of the proceeding, he made them swear allegiance 
<A NAME="277"></A>to Vespasian. At the same time the images of Vitellius were torn down, 
<A NAME="278"></A>and persons were despatched to convey the intelligence to Antonius. But 
<A NAME="279"></A>when this treason became noised abroad throughout the camp, when the soldiers, 
<A NAME="280"></A>hurrying back to head-quarters, saw the name of Vespasian written on the 
<A NAME="281"></A>colours, and the images of Vitellius thrown upon the ground, first there 
<A NAME="282"></A>was a gloomy silence, then all their rage burst out at once. "What," they 
<A NAME="283"></A>cried, "has the glory of the army of Germany fallen so low, that without 
<A NAME="284"></A>a battle, even without a wound, they should yield up hands ready bound 
<A NAME="285"></A>and arms resigned to surrender? What legions indeed are these against us? 
<A NAME="286"></A>Only the conquered. The first and the twelfth, the sole strength of the 
<A NAME="287"></A>Othonianist army, are not there, and even them we routed and crushed on 
<A NAME="288"></A>these very plains, only that so many thousands of armed men, like a herd 
<A NAME="289"></A>of slaves for sale, might be given as a present to the exile Antonius. 
<A NAME="290"></A>Thus, forsooth, the adhesion of one fleet would be worth eight legions. 
<A NAME="291"></A>So it pleases Bassus and Caecina, after robbing the Emperor of palaces, 
<A NAME="292"></A>gardens, and money, to rob the soldiers of their Emperor. But we, who have 
<A NAME="293"></A>seen nothing of toil and bloodshed, we, who must be contemptible even to 
<A NAME="294"></A>the Flavianists, what shall we answer to those who shall ask us of our 
<A NAME="295"></A>victories and our defeats?"
<A NAME="296"></A><BR><BR>Joining one and all in these cries, by which each expressed his 
<A NAME="297"></A>own vexation, they proceeded, following the lead of the fifth legion, to 
<A NAME="298"></A>replace the images of Vitellius, and to put Caecina in irons. They elected 
<A NAME="299"></A>to the command Fabius Fabullus, legate of the fifth legion, and Cassius 
<A NAME="300"></A>Longus, prefect of the camp; they massacred the soldiers from three Liburnian 
<A NAME="301"></A>ships, who happened to fall in their way, but who were perfectly ignorant 
<A NAME="302"></A>and innocent of these proceedings; they then abandoned the camp, and, after 
<A NAME="303"></A>breaking down the bridge, fell back on Hostilia, and thence on Cremona, 
<A NAME="304"></A>in order to effect a junction with the two legions, the 1st Italica and 
<A NAME="305"></A>the 21st Rapax, which, with a portion of the cavalry, Caecina had sent 
<A NAME="306"></A>on to occupy Cremona.
<A NAME="307"></A><BR><BR>On this becoming known to Antonius, he determined to attack the 
<A NAME="308"></A>hostile armies, while they were still distracted in feeling and divided 
<A NAME="309"></A>in strength, before the generals could recover their authority, and the 
<A NAME="310"></A>soldiers their subordination along with that confidence which would spring 
<A NAME="311"></A>from the junction of the legions. He concluded indeed that Fabius Valens 
<A NAME="312"></A>had left the capital, and would hasten his march, on hearing of the treason 
<A NAME="313"></A>of Caecina; and Fabius was loyal to Vitellius, and not without some military 
<A NAME="314"></A>skill. At the same time he dreaded the approach of a vast body of Germans 
<A NAME="315"></A>by way of Rhaetia. Vitellius had also summoned reinforcements from Britain, 
<A NAME="316"></A>Gaul, and Spain, whose arms would have wasted like a wide-spread pestilence, 
<A NAME="317"></A>had not Antonius, fearful of this very danger, hurried on an engagement, 
<A NAME="318"></A>and thus secured his victory. He reached Bedriacum with his whole army 
<A NAME="319"></A>in two days' march from Verona. The next day, keeping the legions to fortify 
<A NAME="320"></A>the position, he sent the auxiliary infantry into the territories of Cremona, 
<A NAME="321"></A>ostensibly to collect supplies, really to imbue the soldiery with a taste 
<A NAME="322"></A>for the spoils of civil war. He himself advanced with 4000 cavalry as far 
<A NAME="323"></A>as the 8th milestone from Bedriacum, in order that they might plunder with 
<A NAME="324"></A>greater freedom. The scouts, as usual, took a wider 
<A NAME="325"></A>range.
<A NAME="326"></A><BR><BR>It was almost eleven o'clock, when a horseman arrived at full speed 
<A NAME="327"></A>with the news, that the enemy were approaching, that a small body was moving 
<A NAME="328"></A>in front, but that the stir and noise could be heard far and wide. While 
<A NAME="329"></A>Antonius was deliberating as to what was to be done, Arrius Varus, eager 
<A NAME="330"></A>to do his best, charged with the bravest of the cavalry, and drove back 
<A NAME="331"></A>the Vitellianists, inflicting upon them some slight loss; as more came 
<A NAME="332"></A>up, the fortune of the day changed, and those who had been most eager in 
<A NAME="333"></A>the pursuit found themselves last in the flight. This rash act did not 
<A NAME="334"></A>originate with Antonius; he anticipated in fact what actually happened. 
<A NAME="335"></A>He now urged his soldiers to enter on the battle with a good heart; he 
<A NAME="336"></A>then drew off the squadrons of his cavalry to the two flanks, leaving in 
<A NAME="337"></A>the midst an open space in which to receive Varus and his troopers; the 
<A NAME="338"></A>legions were ordered to arm themselves, signals were made over the country 
<A NAME="339"></A>that every man should leave plundering, and join the battle at the nearest 
<A NAME="340"></A>point. Meanwhile the terror-stricken Varus plunged into the disordered 
<A NAME="341"></A>ranks of his friends, and brought a panic with him. The fresh troops were 
<A NAME="342"></A>driven back along with the wounded fugitives, confused by their own alarm 
<A NAME="343"></A>and by the difficulties of the road.
<A NAME="344"></A><BR><BR>In the midst of this panic Antonius omitted nothing that a self-possessed 
<A NAME="345"></A>commander or a most intrepid soldier could do. He threw himself before 
<A NAME="346"></A>the terrified fugitives, he held back those who were giving way, and wherever 
<A NAME="347"></A>the struggle was hardest, wherever there was a gleam of hope, there he 
<A NAME="348"></A>was with his ready skill, his bold hand, his encouraging voice, easily 
<A NAME="349"></A>recognized by the enemy, and a conspicuous object to his own men. At last 
<A NAME="350"></A>he was carried to such a pitch of excitement, that he transfixed with a 
<A NAME="351"></A>lance a flying standard bearer, and then, seizing the standard, turned 
<A NAME="352"></A>it towards the enemy. Touched by the reproach, a few troopers, not more 
<A NAME="353"></A>than a hundred in number, made a stand. The locality favoured them, for 
<A NAME="354"></A>the road was at that point particularly narrow, while the bridge over the 
<A NAME="355"></A>stream which crossed it had been broken down, and the stream itself, with 
<A NAME="356"></A>its varying channel and its precipitous banks, checked their flight. It 
<A NAME="357"></A>was this necessity, or a happy chance, that restored the fallen fortunes 
<A NAME="358"></A>of the party. Forming themselves into strong and close ranks, they received 
<A NAME="359"></A>the attack of the Vitellianists, who were now imprudently scattered. These 
<A NAME="360"></A>were at once overthrown. Antonius pursued those that fled, and crushed 
<A NAME="361"></A>those that encountered him. Then came the rest of his troops, who, as they 
<A NAME="362"></A>were severally disposed, plundered, made prisoners, or seized on weapons 
<A NAME="363"></A>and horses. Roused by the shouts of triumph, those who had lately been 
<A NAME="364"></A>scattered in flight over the fields hastened to share in the 
<A NAME="365"></A>victory.
<A NAME="366"></A><BR><BR>At the fourth milestone from Cremona glittered the standards of 
<A NAME="367"></A>two legions, the Italica and the Rapax, which had been advanced as far 
<A NAME="368"></A>as that point during the success achieved by the first movement of their 
<A NAME="369"></A>cavalry. But when fortune changed, they would not open their ranks, nor 
<A NAME="370"></A>receive the fugitives, nor advance and themselves attack an enemy now exhausted 
<A NAME="371"></A>by so protracted a pursuit and conflict. Vanquished by accident, these 
<A NAME="372"></A>men had never in their success valued their general as much as they now 
<A NAME="373"></A>in disaster felt his absence. The victorious cavalry charged the wavering 
<A NAME="374"></A>line; the tribune Vipstanus Messalla followed with the auxiliary troops 
<A NAME="375"></A>from Moesia, whom, though hurriedly brought up, long service had made as 
<A NAME="376"></A>good soldiers as the legionaries. The horse and foot, thus mixed together, 
<A NAME="377"></A>broke through the line of the legions. The near neighbourhood of the fortifications 
<A NAME="378"></A>of Cremona, while it gave more hope of escape, diminished the vigour of 
<A NAME="379"></A>their resistance.
<A NAME="380"></A><BR><BR>Antonius did not press forward, for he thought of the fatigue and 
<A NAME="381"></A>the wounds with which a battle so hard fought, notwithstanding its successful 
<A NAME="382"></A>termination, must have disabled his cavalry and their horses. As the shadows 
<A NAME="383"></A>of evening deepened the whole strength of the Flavianist army came up. 
<A NAME="384"></A>They advanced amid heaps of dead and the traces of recent slaughter, and, 
<A NAME="385"></A>as if the war was over, demanded that they should advance to Cremona, and 
<A NAME="386"></A>receive the capitulation of the vanquished party, or take the place by 
<A NAME="387"></A>storm. This was the motive alleged, and it sounded well, but what every 
<A NAME="388"></A>one said to himself was this: "The colony, situated as it is on level ground, 
<A NAME="389"></A>may be taken by assault. If we attack under cover of darkness, we shall 
<A NAME="390"></A>be at least as bold, and shall enjoy more licence in plunder. If we wait 
<A NAME="391"></A>for the light, we shall be met with entreaties for peace, and in return 
<A NAME="392"></A>for our toil and our wounds shall receive only the empty satisfaction of 
<A NAME="393"></A>clemency and praise, but the wealth of Cremona will go into the purses 
<A NAME="394"></A>of the legates and the prefects. The soldiers have the plunder of a city 
<A NAME="395"></A>that is stormed, the generals of one which capitulates." The centurions 
<A NAME="396"></A>and tribunes were spurned away; that no man's voice might be heard, the 
<A NAME="397"></A>troops clashed their weapons together, ready to break through all discipline, 
<A NAME="398"></A>unless they were led as they wished.
<A NAME="399"></A><BR><BR>Antonius then made his way into the companies. When his presence 
<A NAME="400"></A>and personal authority had restored silence, he declared, "I would not 
<A NAME="401"></A>snatch their glory or their reward from those who have deserved them so 
<A NAME="402"></A>well. Yet there is a division of duties between the army and its generals. 
<A NAME="403"></A>Eagerness for battle becomes the soldiers, but generals serve the cause 
<A NAME="404"></A>by forethought, by counsel, by delay oftener than by temerity. As I promoted 
<A NAME="405"></A>your victory to the utmost of my power by my sword and by my personal exertions, 
<A NAME="406"></A>so now I must help you by prudence and by counsel, the qualities which 
<A NAME="407"></A>belong peculiarly to a general. What you will have to encounter is indeed 
<A NAME="408"></A>perfectly plain. There will be the darkness, the strange localities of 
<A NAME="409"></A>the town, the enemy inside the walls, and all possible facilities for ambuscades. 
<A NAME="410"></A>Even if the gates were wide open, we ought not to enter the place, except 
<A NAME="411"></A>we had first reconnoitred it, and in the day-time. Shall we set about storming 
<A NAME="412"></A>the town when we have no means seeing where the ground is level, what is 
<A NAME="413"></A>the height of the walls, whether the city is to be assailed by our artillery 
<A NAME="414"></A>and javelins, or by siege-works and covered approaches?" He then turned 
<A NAME="415"></A>to individual soldiers, asking them whether they had brought with them 
<A NAME="416"></A>their axes and spades and whatever else is used when towns are to be stormed. 
<A NAME="417"></A>On their admitting that they had not done so, "Can any hands," he answered, 
<A NAME="418"></A>"break through and undermine walls with swords and lances? And if it should 
<A NAME="419"></A>be found necessary to throw up an embankment and to shelter ourselves under 
<A NAME="420"></A>mantlets and hurdles, shall we stand baffled like a thoughtless mob, marvelling 
<A NAME="421"></A>at the height of the towers and at the enemy's defences? Shall we not rather, 
<A NAME="422"></A>by delaying one night, till our artillery and engines come up, take with 
<A NAME="423"></A>us a strength that must prevail?" At the same time he sent the sutlers 
<A NAME="424"></A>and camp-followers with the freshest of the cavalry to Bedriacum to fetch 
<A NAME="425"></A>supplies and whatever else they needed.
<A NAME="426"></A><BR><BR>The soldiers, however, were impatient, and a mutiny had almost 
<A NAME="427"></A>broken out, when some cavalry, who had advanced to the very walls of Cremona, 
<A NAME="428"></A>seized some stragglers from the town, from whose information it was ascertained, 
<A NAME="429"></A>that the six legions of Vitellius and the entire army which had been quartered 
<A NAME="430"></A>at Hostilia had on that very day marched a distance of thirty miles, and 
<A NAME="431"></A>having heard of the defeat of their comrades, were preparing for battle, 
<A NAME="432"></A>and would soon be coming up. This alarm opened the ears that had before 
<A NAME="433"></A>been deaf to their general's advice. The 13th legion was ordered to take 
<A NAME="434"></A>up its position on the raised causeway of the Via Postumia, supported on 
<A NAME="435"></A>the left by the 7th (Galba's) which was posted in the plain, next came 
<A NAME="436"></A>the 7th (Claudius'), defended in front by a field-ditch, such being the 
<A NAME="437"></A>character of the ground. On the right was the 8th legion, drawn up in an 
<A NAME="438"></A>open space, and then the 3rd, whose ranks were divided by some thick brushwood. 
<A NAME="439"></A>Such was the arrangement of the eagles and the standards. The soldiers 
<A NAME="440"></A>were mingled in the darkness as accident had determined. The Praetorian 
<A NAME="441"></A>colours were close to the 3rd legion; the auxiliary infantry were stationed 
<A NAME="442"></A>on the wings; the cavalry covered the flanks and the rear. Sido and Italicus, 
<A NAME="443"></A>the Suevian chieftains, with a picked body of their countrymen, manoeuvred 
<A NAME="444"></A>in the van.
<A NAME="445"></A><BR><BR>It would have been the best policy for the army of Vitellius to 
<A NAME="446"></A>rest at Cremona, and, with strength recruited by food and repose, to attack 
<A NAME="447"></A>and crush the next day an enemy exhausted by cold and hunger; but now, 
<A NAME="448"></A>wanting a leader, and having no settled plan, they came into collision 
<A NAME="449"></A>about nine o'clock at night with the Flavianist troops, who stood ready, 
<A NAME="450"></A>and in order of battle. Respecting the disposition of the Vitellianist 
<A NAME="451"></A>army, disordered as it was by its fury and by the darkness, I would not 
<A NAME="452"></A>venture to speak positively. Some, however, have related, that on the right 
<A NAME="453"></A>wing was the 4th legion (the Macedonian); that the 5th and 15th, with the 
<A NAME="454"></A>veterans of three British legions (the 9th, 2nd, and 20th), formed the 
<A NAME="455"></A>centre, while the left wing was made up of the 1st, the 16th, and the 22nd. 
<A NAME="456"></A>Men of the legions Rapax and Italica were mingled with all the companies. 
<A NAME="457"></A>The cavalry and the auxiliaries chose their position themselves. Throughout 
<A NAME="458"></A>the night the battle raged in many forms, indecisive and fierce, destructive, 
<A NAME="459"></A>first to one side, then to the other. Courage, strength, even the eye with 
<A NAME="460"></A>its keenest sight, were of no avail. Both armies fought with the same weapons; 
<A NAME="461"></A>the watch-word, continually asked, became known; the colours were confused 
<A NAME="462"></A>together, as parties of combatants snatched them from the enemy, and hurried 
<A NAME="463"></A>them in this or that direction. The 7th legion, recently levied by Galba, 
<A NAME="464"></A>was the hardest pressed. Six centurions of the first rank were killed, 
<A NAME="465"></A>and some of the standards taken; but the eagle was saved by Atilius Verus, 
<A NAME="466"></A>the centurion of the first company, who, after making a great slaughter 
<A NAME="467"></A>among the enemy, at last fell.
<A NAME="468"></A><BR><BR>The line was supported, as it began to waver, by Antonius, who 
<A NAME="469"></A>brought up the Praetorians. They took up the conflict, repulsed the enemy, 
<A NAME="470"></A>and were then themselves repulsed. The troops of Vitellius had collected 
<A NAME="471"></A>their artillery on the raised causeway, where there was a free and open 
<A NAME="472"></A>space for the discharge of the missiles, which at first had been scattered 
<A NAME="473"></A>at random, and had struck against the trees without injury to the enemy. 
<A NAME="474"></A>An engine of remarkable size, belonging to the 15th legion, was crushing 
<A NAME="475"></A>the hostile ranks with huge stones, and would have spread destruction far 
<A NAME="476"></A>and wide, had not two soldiers ventured on a deed of surpassing bravery. 
<A NAME="477"></A>Disguising themselves with shields snatched from the midst of the carnage, 
<A NAME="478"></A>they cut the ropes and springs of the engine. They were instantly slain, 
<A NAME="479"></A>and their names have consequently been lost; but the fact is undoubted. 
<A NAME="480"></A>Fortune favoured neither side, till at a late hour of the night the moon 
<A NAME="481"></A>rose and showed, but showed deceptively, both armies. The light, however, 
<A NAME="482"></A>shining from behind, favoured the Flavianists. With them a lengthened shadow 
<A NAME="483"></A>fell from men and horses, and the enemy's missiles, incorrectly aimed at 
<A NAME="484"></A>what seemed the substance, fell short, while the Vitellianists, who had 
<A NAME="485"></A>the light shining on their faces, were unconsciously exposed to an enemy 
<A NAME="486"></A>who were, so to speak, concealed while they aimed.
<A NAME="487"></A><BR><BR>As soon as Antonius could recognize his men and be recognized by 
<A NAME="488"></A>them, he sought to kindle their courage, striving to shame some with his 
<A NAME="489"></A>reproaches, stirring many with praise and encouragement, and all with hopes 
<A NAME="490"></A>and promises. "Why," he demanded of the legions of Pannonia, "have you 
<A NAME="491"></A>again taken up arms? Yonder is the field where you may wipe out the stain 
<A NAME="492"></A>of past disgrace, and redeem your honour." Then turning to the troops of 
<A NAME="493"></A>Moesia, he appealed to them as the authors and originators of the war. 
<A NAME="494"></A>"Idly," he said "have you challenged the Vitellianists with threatening 
<A NAME="495"></A>words, if you cannot abide their attack or even their looks." So he spoke 
<A NAME="496"></A>to each as he approached them. The third legion he addressed at greater 
<A NAME="497"></A>length, reminding them of old and recent achievements, how under Marcus 
<A NAME="498"></A>Antonius they had defeated the Parthians, under Corbulo the Armenians, 
<A NAME="499"></A>and had lately discomfited the Sarmatians. Then angrily turning to the 
<A NAME="500"></A>Praetorians, "Clowns," said he, "unless you are victorious, what other 
<A NAME="501"></A>general, what other camp will receive you? There are your colours and your 
<A NAME="502"></A>arms; defeat is death, for disgrace you have exhausted." A shout was raised 
<A NAME="503"></A>on all sides, and the soldiers of the third legion saluted, as is the custom 
<A NAME="504"></A>in Syria, the rising sun.
<A NAME="505"></A><BR><BR>A vague rumour thus arose, or was intentionally suggested by the 
<A NAME="506"></A>general, that Mucianus had arrived, and that the two armies had exchanged 
<A NAME="507"></A>salutations. The men then charged as confidently as if they had been strengthened 
<A NAME="508"></A>by fresh reinforcements, while the enemy's array was now less compact; 
<A NAME="509"></A>for, as there was no one to command, it was now contracted, now extended, 
<A NAME="510"></A>as the courage or fear of individual soldiers might prompt. Antonius, seeing 
<A NAME="511"></A>that they gave way, charged them with a heavy column; the loose ranks were 
<A NAME="512"></A>at once broken, and, entangled as they were among their wagons and artillery, 
<A NAME="513"></A>could not be re-formed. The conquerors, in the eagerness of pursuit, dispersed 
<A NAME="514"></A>themselves over the entire line of road. The slaughter that followed was 
<A NAME="515"></A>made particularly memorable through the murder of a father by his son. 
<A NAME="516"></A>I will record the incident with the names, on the authority of Vipstanus 
<A NAME="517"></A>Messalla. Julius Mansuetus, a Spaniard, enlisting in the legion Rapax, 
<A NAME="518"></A>had left at home a son of tender age. The lad grew up to manhood, and was 
<A NAME="519"></A>enrolled by Galba in the 7th legion. Now chancing to meet his father, he 
<A NAME="520"></A>brought him to the ground with a wound, and, as he rifled his dying foe, 
<A NAME="521"></A>recognized him, and was himself recognized. Clasping the expiring man in 
<A NAME="522"></A>his arms, in piteous accents he implored the spirit of his father to be 
<A NAME="523"></A>propitious to him, and not to turn from him with loathing as from a parricide. 
<A NAME="524"></A>"This guilt," he said, "is shared by all; how small a part of a civil war 
<A NAME="525"></A>is a single soldier!" With these words he raised the body, opened a grave, 
<A NAME="526"></A>and discharged the last duties for his father. This was noticed by those 
<A NAME="527"></A>who were on the spot, then by many others; astonishment and indignation 
<A NAME="528"></A>ran through the whole army, and they cursed this most horrible war. Yet 
<A NAME="529"></A>as eagerly as ever they stripped the bodies of slaughtered kinsfolk, connexions, 
<A NAME="530"></A>and brothers. They talk of an impious act having been done, and they do 
<A NAME="531"></A>it themselves.
<A NAME="532"></A><BR><BR>When they reached Cremona a fresh work of vast difficulty presented 
<A NAME="533"></A>itself. During the war with Otho the legions of Germany had formed their 
<A NAME="534"></A>camp round the walls of the city, round this camp had drawn an entrenchment, 
<A NAME="535"></A>and had again strengthened these defences. At this sight the victorious 
<A NAME="536"></A>army hesitated, while the generals doubted what orders they should give. 
<A NAME="537"></A>To attempt an assault with troops exhausted by the toil of a day and a 
<A NAME="538"></A>night would be difficult, and with no proper reserves might be perilous. 
<A NAME="539"></A>Should they return to Bedriacum, the fatigue of so long a march would be 
<A NAME="540"></A>insupportable, and their victory would result in nothing. To entrench a 
<A NAME="541"></A>camp with the enemy so close at hand would be dangerous, as by a sudden 
<A NAME="542"></A>sortie they might cause confusion among them while dispersed and busied 
<A NAME="543"></A>with the work. Above all, they were afraid of their soldiers, who were 
<A NAME="544"></A>more patient of danger than delay. Cautious measures they disliked; their 
<A NAME="545"></A>rashness inspired them with hope, and eagerness for plunder outweighed 
<A NAME="546"></A>all the horrors of carnage, wounds, and bloodshed.
<A NAME="547"></A><BR><BR>Antonius himself was this way inclined, and he ordered the entrenched 
<A NAME="548"></A>camp to be invested. At first they fought from a distance with arrows and 
<A NAME="549"></A>stones, the Flavianists suffering most, as the enemy's missiles were aimed 
<A NAME="550"></A>at them from a superior height. Antonius then assigned to each legion the 
<A NAME="551"></A>attack on some portion of the entrenchments, and on one particular gate, 
<A NAME="552"></A>seeking by this division of labour to distinguish the cowardly from the 
<A NAME="553"></A>brave, and to stimulate his men by an honourable rivalry. The 3rd and 7th 
<A NAME="554"></A>legions took up a position close to the road from Bedriacum; more to the 
<A NAME="555"></A>right of the entrenchments were stationed the 8th and the 7th (Claudius'). 
<A NAME="556"></A>The 13th were carried by the impetuosity of their attack as far as the 
<A NAME="557"></A>gate looking towards Brixia. There ensued a little delay, while from the 
<A NAME="558"></A>neighbouring fields some were collecting spades and pickaxes, others hooks 
<A NAME="559"></A>and ladders. Then raising their shields over their heads, they advanced 
<A NAME="560"></A>to the rampart in a dense "testudo." Both used the arts of Roman warfare; 
<A NAME="561"></A>the Vitellianists rolled down ponderous stones, and drove spears and long 
<A NAME="562"></A>poles into the broken and tottering "testudo," till the dense array of 
<A NAME="563"></A>shields was loosened, and the ground was strewn with a vast number of lifeless 
<A NAME="564"></A>and mangled bodies.
<A NAME="565"></A><BR><BR><B>28.</B> Some hesitation had shewn itself, when the generals, 
<A NAME="566"></A>seeing that the weary troops would not listen to what seemed to them unmeaning 
<A NAME="567"></A>encouragement, pointed to Cremona. Whether this was, as Messalla relates, 
<A NAME="568"></A>the device of Hormus, or whether Caius Plinius be the better authority 
<A NAME="569"></A>when he charges it upon Antonius, I cannot easily determine. All I can 
<A NAME="570"></A>say is this, that neither in Antonius nor in Hormus would this foulest 
<A NAME="571"></A>of crimes have been a degeneracy from the character of their former lives. 
<A NAME="572"></A>Wounds or bloodshed no longer kept the men back from undermining the rampart 
<A NAME="573"></A>and battering the gates. Supported on the shoulders of comrades, and forming 
<A NAME="574"></A>a second "testudo," they clambered up and seized the weapons and even the 
<A NAME="575"></A>hands of the enemy. The unhurt and the wounded, the half-dead and the dying, 
<A NAME="576"></A>were mingled together with every incident of slaughter and death in every 
<A NAME="577"></A>form.
<A NAME="578"></A><BR><BR>The fiercest struggle was maintained by the 3rd and 7th legions, 
<A NAME="579"></A>and Antonius in person with some chosen auxiliaries concentrated his efforts 
<A NAME="580"></A>on the same point. The Vitellianists, unable to resist the combined and 
<A NAME="581"></A>resolute attack, and finding that their missiles glided off the "testudo," 
<A NAME="582"></A>at last threw the engine itself on the assailants; for a moment it broke 
<A NAME="583"></A>and overwhelmed those on whom it fell, but it drew after it in its fall 
<A NAME="584"></A>the battlements and upper part of the rampart. At the same time an adjoining 
<A NAME="585"></A>tower yielded to the volleys of stones, and, while the 7th legion in wedge-like 
<A NAME="586"></A>array was endeavouring to force an entrance, the 3rd broke down the gate 
<A NAME="587"></A>with axes and swords. All authors are agreed that Caius Volusius, a soldier 
<A NAME="588"></A>of the 3rd legion, entered first. Beating down all who opposed him, he 
<A NAME="589"></A>mounted the rampart, waved his hand, and shouted aloud that the camp was 
<A NAME="590"></A>taken. The rest of the legion burst in, while the troops of Vitellius were 
<A NAME="591"></A>seized with panic, and threw themselves from the rampart. The entire space 
<A NAME="592"></A>between the camp and the walls of Cremona was filled with 
<A NAME="593"></A>slain.
<A NAME="594"></A><BR><BR>Difficulties of another kind presented themselves in the lofty 
<A NAME="595"></A>walls of the town, its stone towers, its iron-barred gates, in the garrison 
<A NAME="596"></A>who stood brandishing their weapons, in its numerous population devoted 
<A NAME="597"></A>to the interests of Vitellius, and in the vast conflux from all parts of 
<A NAME="598"></A>Italy which had assembled at the fair regularly held at that time. The 
<A NAME="599"></A>besieged found a source of strength in these large numbers; the assailants 
<A NAME="600"></A>an incentive in the prospect of booty. Antonius gave orders that fire should 
<A NAME="601"></A>instantly be set to the finest buildings without the city, to see whether 
<A NAME="602"></A>the inhabitants of Cremona might not be induced by the loss of their property 
<A NAME="603"></A>to transfer their allegiance. Some houses near the walls, which overtopped 
<A NAME="604"></A>the fortifications, he filled with the bravest of his soldiers, who, by 
<A NAME="605"></A>hurling beams, tiles, and flaming missiles, dislodged the defenders from 
<A NAME="606"></A>the ramparts.
<A NAME="607"></A><BR><BR>The legions now began to form themselves into a "testudo," and 
<A NAME="608"></A>the other troops to discharge volleys of stones and darts, when the courage 
<A NAME="609"></A>of the Vitellianists began to flag. The higher their rank, the more readily 
<A NAME="610"></A>they succumbed to fortune, fearing that when Cremona had fallen quarter 
<A NAME="611"></A>could no longer be expected, and that all the fury of the conqueror would 
<A NAME="612"></A>be turned, not on the penniless crowd, but on the tribunes and centurions, 
<A NAME="613"></A>by whose slaughter something was to be gained. The common soldiers, careless 
<A NAME="614"></A>of the future and safer in their obscurity, still held out. Roaming through 
<A NAME="615"></A>the streets or concealed in the houses, they would not sue for peace even 
<A NAME="616"></A>when they had abandoned the contest. The principal officers of the camp 
<A NAME="617"></A>removed the name and images of Vitellius; Caecina, who was still in confinement, 
<A NAME="618"></A>they released from his chains, imploring him to plead their cause. When 
<A NAME="619"></A>he haughtily rejected their suit, they entreated him with tears; and it 
<A NAME="620"></A>was indeed the last aggravation of misery, that many valiant men should 
<A NAME="621"></A>invoke the aid of a traitor. Then they displayed from the walls the olive 
<A NAME="622"></A>branches and chaplets of suppliants, and when Antonius had ordered that 
<A NAME="623"></A>the discharge of missiles should cease, they brought out the eagles and 
<A NAME="624"></A>standards. Then followed, with eyes bent on the ground, a dismal array 
<A NAME="625"></A>of unarmed men. The conquerors had gathered round; at first they heaped 
<A NAME="626"></A>reproaches on them and pointed at them their weapons; then seeing how they 
<A NAME="627"></A>offered their cheeks to insulting blows, how, with all their high spirit 
<A NAME="628"></A>departed, they submitted, as vanquished men, to every indignity, it suddenly 
<A NAME="629"></A>occurred to their recollection, that these were the very soldiers who but 
<A NAME="630"></A>shortly before had used with moderation their victory at Bedriacum. Yet, 
<A NAME="631"></A>when Caecina the consul, conspicuous in his robes of state and with his 
<A NAME="632"></A>train of lictors, came forward thrusting aside the crowd, the victors were 
<A NAME="633"></A>fired with indignation, and reproached him with his tyranny, his cruelty, 
<A NAME="634"></A>and, so hateful are such crimes, even with his treason. Antonius checked 
<A NAME="635"></A>them, gave him an escort, and sent him to Vespasian.
<A NAME="636"></A><BR><BR>Meanwhile the population of Cremona was roughly handled by the 
<A NAME="637"></A>soldiers, who were just beginning a massacre, when their fury was mitigated 
<A NAME="638"></A>by the entreaties of the generals. Antonius summoned them to an assembly, 
<A NAME="639"></A>extolled the conquerors, spoke kindly to the conquered, but said nothing 
<A NAME="640"></A>either way of Cremona. Over and above the innate love of plunder, there 
<A NAME="641"></A>was an old feud which made the army bent on the destruction of the inhabitants. 
<A NAME="642"></A>It was generally believed that in the war with Otho, as well as in the 
<A NAME="643"></A>present, they had supported the cause of Vitellius. Afterwards, when the 
<A NAME="644"></A>13th legion had been left to build an amphitheatre, with the characteristic 
<A NAME="645"></A>insolence of a city population, they had wantonly provoked and insulted 
<A NAME="646"></A>them. The ill-feeling had been aggravated by the gladiatorial show exhibited 
<A NAME="647"></A>there by Caecina, by the circumstance that their city was now for the second 
<A NAME="648"></A>time the seat of war, and by the fact that they had supplied the Vitellianists 
<A NAME="649"></A>with provisions in the field, and that some of their women, taken by party-zeal 
<A NAME="650"></A>into the battle, had there been slain. The occurrence of the fair filled 
<A NAME="651"></A>the colony, rich as it always was, with an appearance of still greater 
<A NAME="652"></A>wealth. The other generals were unnoticed; Antonius from his success and 
<A NAME="653"></A>high reputation was observed of all. He had hastened to the baths to wash 
<A NAME="654"></A>off the blood; and when he found fault with the temperature of the water, 
<A NAME="655"></A>an answer was heard, "that it would soon be warm enough. Thus the words 
<A NAME="656"></A>of a slave brought on him the whole odium of having given the signal for 
<A NAME="657"></A>firing the town, which was indeed already in flames.
<A NAME="658"></A><BR><BR>Forty thousand armed men burst into Cremona, and with them a body 
<A NAME="659"></A>of sutlers and camp-followers, yet more numerous and yet more abandoned 
<A NAME="660"></A>to lust and cruelty. Neither age nor rank were any protection from indiscriminate 
<A NAME="661"></A>slaughter and violation. Aged men and women past their prime, worthless 
<A NAME="662"></A>as booty, were dragged about in wanton insult. Did a grown up maiden or 
<A NAME="663"></A>youth of marked beauty fall in their way, they were torn in pieces by the 
<A NAME="664"></A>violent hands of ravishers; and in the end the destroyers themselves were 
<A NAME="665"></A>provoked into mutual slaughter. Men, as they carried off for themselves 
<A NAME="666"></A>coin or temple-offerings of massive gold, were cut down by others of superior 
<A NAME="667"></A>strength. Some, scorning what met the eye, searched for hidden wealth, 
<A NAME="668"></A>and dug up buried treasures, applying the scourge and the torture to the 
<A NAME="669"></A>owners. In their hands were flaming torches, which, as soon as they had 
<A NAME="670"></A>carried out the spoil, they wantonly hurled into the gutted houses and 
<A NAME="671"></A>plundered temples. In an army which included such varieties of language 
<A NAME="672"></A>and character, an army comprising Roman citizens, allies, and foreigners, 
<A NAME="673"></A>there was every kind of had a law of his own, and nothing was forbidden. 
<A NAME="674"></A>For four days Cremona satisfied the plunderers. When all things else, sacred 
<A NAME="675"></A>and profane, were settling down into the flames, the temple of Mephitis 
<A NAME="676"></A>outside the walls alone remained standing, saved by its situation or by 
<A NAME="677"></A>divine interposition.
<A NAME="678"></A><BR><BR>Such was the end of Cremona, 286 years after its foundation. It 
<A NAME="679"></A>was built in the consulship of Tiberius Sempronius and Cornelius Scipio, 
<A NAME="680"></A>when Hannibal was threatening Italy, as a protection against the Gauls 
<A NAME="681"></A>from beyond the Padus, or against any other sudden invader from the Alps. 
<A NAME="682"></A>From the number of settlers, the conveniences afforded by the rivers, the 
<A NAME="683"></A>fertility of the soil, and the many connexions and intermarriages formed 
<A NAME="684"></A>with neighbouring nations, it grew and flourished, unharmed by foreign 
<A NAME="685"></A>enemies, though most unfortunate in civil wars. Ashamed of the atrocious 
<A NAME="686"></A>deed, and aware of the detestation which it was inspiring, Antonius issued 
<A NAME="687"></A>a proclamation, that no one should detain in captivity a citizen of Cremona. 
<A NAME="688"></A>The spoil indeed had been rendered valueless to the soldiers by a general 
<A NAME="689"></A>agreement throughout Italy, which rejected with loathing the purchase of 
<A NAME="690"></A>such slaves. A massacre then began; when this was known, the prisoners 
<A NAME="691"></A>were secretly ransomed by their friends and relatives. The remaining inhabitants 
<A NAME="692"></A>soon returned to Cremona; the temples and squares were restored by the 
<A NAME="693"></A>munificence of the burghers, and Vespasian gave his 
<A NAME="694"></A>exhortations.
<A NAME="695"></A><BR><BR>The soil poisoned with blood forbade the enemy to remain long by 
<A NAME="696"></A>the ruins of the buried city. They advanced to the third milestone, and 
<A NAME="697"></A>gathered the dispersed and panic-stricken Vitellianists round their proper 
<A NAME="698"></A>standards. The vanquished legions were then scattered throughout Illyricum; 
<A NAME="699"></A>for civil war was not over, and they might play a doubtful part. Messengers 
<A NAME="700"></A>carrying news of the victory were then despatched to Britain and to Spain. 
<A NAME="701"></A>Julius Calenus, a tribune, was sent to Gaul, and Alpinius Montanus, prefect 
<A NAME="702"></A>of a cohort, to Germany; as the one was an Aeduan, the other a Trever, 
<A NAME="703"></A>and both were Vitellianists, they would be a proof of the success. At the 
<A NAME="704"></A>same time the passes of the Alps were occupied with troops, for it was 
<A NAME="705"></A>suspected that Germany was arming itself to support 
<A NAME="706"></A>Vitellius.
<A NAME="707"></A><BR><BR>A few days after the departure of Caecina, Vitellius had hurried 
<A NAME="708"></A>Fabius Valens to the seat of war, and was now seeking to hide his apprehensions 
<A NAME="709"></A>from himself by indulgence. He made no military preparation; he did not 
<A NAME="710"></A>seek to invigorate the soldiers by encouraging speeches or warlike exercises; 
<A NAME="711"></A>he did not keep himself before the eyes of the people. Buried in the shades 
<A NAME="712"></A>of his gardens, like those sluggish animals which, if you supply them with 
<A NAME="713"></A>food, lie motionless and torpid, he had dismissed with the same forgetfulness 
<A NAME="714"></A>the past, the present, and the future. While he thus lay wasting his powers 
<A NAME="715"></A>in sloth among the woods of Aricia, he was startled by the treachery of 
<A NAME="716"></A>Lucilius Bassus and the defection of the fleet at Ravenna. Then came the 
<A NAME="717"></A>news about Caecina, and he heard with a satisfaction mingled with distress, 
<A NAME="718"></A>first, that he had revolted, and then, that he had been put in irons by 
<A NAME="719"></A>the army. In that dull soul joy was more powerful than apprehension. In 
<A NAME="720"></A>great exultation he returned to Rome, and before a crowded assembly of 
<A NAME="721"></A>the people heaped praises on the dutiful obedience of the soldiers. He 
<A NAME="722"></A>ordered Publius Sabinus, prefect of the Praetorian Guard, to be thrown 
<A NAME="723"></A>into prison, because of his friendship with Caecina, and substituted in 
<A NAME="724"></A>his place Alfenius Varus.
<A NAME="725"></A><BR><BR>He then addressed the Senate in a speech of studied grandiloquence, 
<A NAME="726"></A>and was extolled by the Senators with elaborate adulation. A savage resolution 
<A NAME="727"></A>against Caecina was moved by Lucius Vitellius; the rest affected indignation 
<A NAME="728"></A>at the idea that a consul had betrayed the State, a general his Emperor, 
<A NAME="729"></A>a man loaded with wealth so vast and honours so numerous his benefactor, 
<A NAME="730"></A>and seemed to deplore the wrongs of Vitellius, while they uttered their 
<A NAME="731"></A>private griefs. Not a word from any one of them disparaged the Flavianist 
<A NAME="732"></A>leaders; they censured the delusion and recklessness of the armies, and 
<A NAME="733"></A>with a prudent circumlocution avoided the name of Vespasian. A man was 
<A NAME="734"></A>found, who, while all regarded with great contempt both giver and receiver, 
<A NAME="735"></A>wormed himself by flattery into the one day of office which remained to 
<A NAME="736"></A>complete the consulate of Caecina. On the last day of October Rosius Regulus 
<A NAME="737"></A>both assumed and resigned the office. The learned remarked that never before 
<A NAME="738"></A>had a new consul been elected without a formal act of deprivation and the 
<A NAME="739"></A>passing of a law. Before this indeed Caninius Rebilus had been consul for 
<A NAME="740"></A>a single day during the dictatorship of Caius Caesar, when the prizes of 
<A NAME="741"></A>the civil war had to be enjoyed in haste.
<A NAME="742"></A><BR><BR>At this time the murder of Junius Blaesus obtained an infamous 
<A NAME="743"></A>notoriety. Of this act I have heard the following account. Vitellius, who 
<A NAME="744"></A>was suffering from severe illness, observed from the Servilian gardens 
<A NAME="745"></A>a neighbouring turret brilliantly illuminated throughout the night. Inquiring 
<A NAME="746"></A>the cause, he was told that Caecina Tuscus was entertaining a large party, 
<A NAME="747"></A>of whom Junius Blaesus was the most distinguished. Other particulars were 
<A NAME="748"></A>given with much exaggeration about the splendour of the banquet and the 
<A NAME="749"></A>unrestrained gaiety of the guests. There were persons who charged Tuscus 
<A NAME="750"></A>and his guests, and Blaesus more vindictively than any, with passing their 
<A NAME="751"></A>days in merriment while the Emperor was sick. As soon as it was sufficiently 
<A NAME="752"></A>clear to those who keenly watch the angry moods of princes, that Vitellius 
<A NAME="753"></A>was exasperated, and that Blaesus might be destroyed, the part of the informer 
<A NAME="754"></A>was intrusted to Lucius Vitellius. An unworthy jealousy made him the enemy 
<A NAME="755"></A>of Blaesus, whose illustrious character raised him far above one who was 
<A NAME="756"></A>stained with every infamy; he burst into the Imperial chamber, and clasping 
<A NAME="757"></A>to his bosom the Emperor's son, fell at his knees. On Vitellius enquiring 
<A NAME="758"></A>the cause of his emotion: "It is not," he replied, "from any private apprehension, 
<A NAME="759"></A>or because I am anxious for myself; it is for a brother and for a brother's 
<A NAME="760"></A>children that I have come hither with my prayers and tears. It is idle 
<A NAME="761"></A>to fear Vespasian, when there are so many legions of Germany, so many provinces 
<A NAME="762"></A>with their valour and their loyalty, and lastly, so vast an extent of sea 
<A NAME="763"></A>and land with enormous distances, to keep him from us. In the capital, 
<A NAME="764"></A>in the very bosom of the empire, there is the foe of whom we must beware, 
<A NAME="765"></A>a foe who boasts of Junii and Antonii among his ancestors, who, claiming 
<A NAME="766"></A>an Imperial descent, displays to soldiers his condescension and his magnificence. 
<A NAME="767"></A>On him all thoughts are fixed, while Vitellius, regardless alike of friends 
<A NAME="768"></A>and foes, is cherishing a rival, who from his banqueting table gazes at 
<A NAME="769"></A>the sufferings of his sovereign. For such ill-timed mirth let him be recompensed 
<A NAME="770"></A>with a night of sorrow and of death, that he may know and feel that Vitellius 
<A NAME="771"></A>still lives and reigns, and has a son, if in the course of destiny anything 
<A NAME="772"></A>should happen to himself."
<A NAME="773"></A><BR><BR>Vitellius, after wavering between his guilty purpose and his fears, 
<A NAME="774"></A>dreading lest to postpone the murder of Blaesus might hasten his own ruin, 
<A NAME="775"></A>while openly to order it might provoke terrible odium, determined to destroy 
<A NAME="776"></A>him by poison. He gave a proof of his guilt by his marked joy when he visited 
<A NAME="777"></A>Blaesus. He was even heard to utter a most brutal speech, in which (I will 
<A NAME="778"></A>relate the very words) he boasted that he had feasted his eyes on the spectacle 
<A NAME="779"></A>of his enemy's death. Besides his noble birth and refinement of character, 
<A NAME="780"></A>Blaesus was a man of resolute loyalty. In the flourishing days of the party, 
<A NAME="781"></A>when canvassed by Caecina and the leading men, who were beginning to despise 
<A NAME="782"></A>Vitellius, he persevered in rejecting their solicitations. A righteous 
<A NAME="783"></A>man and a lover of peace, who coveted no sudden elevation, much less the 
<A NAME="784"></A>throne, he could not escape being thought to deserve 
<A NAME="785"></A>it.
<A NAME="786"></A><BR><BR>Meanwhile Fabius Valens, who was moving along with a vast and luxurious 
<A NAME="787"></A>train of concubines and eunuchs too tardily for a general about to take 
<A NAME="788"></A>the field, received speedy intelligence of the betrayal of the Ravenna 
<A NAME="789"></A>fleet by Lucilius Bassus. Had he hastened the march which he had then begun, 
<A NAME="790"></A>he might have come up with Caecina while still undecided, or have reached 
<A NAME="791"></A>the legions previous to the decisive action. Some advised him to take a 
<A NAME="792"></A>few of his most devoted soldiers, and, avoiding Ravenna, to hurry on by 
<A NAME="793"></A>unfrequented paths to Hostilia or Cremona. Others thought that he should 
<A NAME="794"></A>summon the Praetorian cohorts from Rome, and then force his way with a 
<A NAME="795"></A>strong body of troops. But with a ruinous delay he wasted in deliberation 
<A NAME="796"></A>the opportunities of action. Eventually he rejected both plans, and did 
<A NAME="797"></A>what is the very worst thing in circumstances of peril, attempted a middle 
<A NAME="798"></A>course, and was neither bold enough on the one hand, nor cautious enough 
<A NAME="799"></A>on the other.
<A NAME="800"></A><BR><BR>He wrote to Vitellius asking for aid. Three cohorts with some British 
<A NAME="801"></A>cavalry arrived, a force too numerous to elude observation, too small to 
<A NAME="802"></A>force its way. Even amidst such perils Valens could not keep himself clear 
<A NAME="803"></A>of the infamous reputation of grasping at unlawful gratifications and polluting 
<A NAME="804"></A>the houses of his hosts with intrigue and violation. He had power, he had 
<A NAME="805"></A>money, and he indulged the lusts that are the last solace of desperate 
<A NAME="806"></A>fortunes. At length on the arrival of the infantry and cavalry the folly 
<A NAME="807"></A>of his plans became evident. With so small a force, even had it been thoroughly 
<A NAME="808"></A>loyal, he could not have made his way through the enemy, and the loyalty 
<A NAME="809"></A>they had brought with them was not beyond suspicion. Yet shame and respect 
<A NAME="810"></A>for the presence of their general held them in check, no lasting restraint 
<A NAME="811"></A>with men who loved danger and were careless of disgrace. Moved by this 
<A NAME="812"></A>apprehension, Valens, while he retained a few attendants whom adversity 
<A NAME="813"></A>had not changed, sent on the infantry to Ariminum and ordered the cavalry 
<A NAME="814"></A>to cover his rear. He then himself made his way to Umbria, and thence to 
<A NAME="815"></A>Etruria, where, having learnt the issue of the battle of Cremona, he conceived 
<A NAME="816"></A>a plan not wanting in vigour, and which, had it succeeded, would have had 
<A NAME="817"></A>terrible results. This was to seize some ships, to land on some part of 
<A NAME="818"></A>Gallia Narbonensis, to rouse Gaul with its armies as well as the tribes 
<A NAME="819"></A>of Germany, and so to kindle a fresh war.
<A NAME="820"></A><BR><BR>The garrison of Ariminum were discouraged by the departure of Valens, 
<A NAME="821"></A>and Cornelius Fuscus, bringing up his army and disposing his Liburnian 
<A NAME="822"></A>ships at the nearest points of the shore, invested the place by sea and 
<A NAME="823"></A>land. His troops occupied the plains of Umbria and that portion of the 
<A NAME="824"></A>Picentine territory that is washed by the Adriatic, and now the whole of 
<A NAME="825"></A>Italy was divided by the range of the Apennines between Vespasian and Vitellius. 
<A NAME="826"></A>Valens, having started from the bay of Pisa, was compelled, either by a 
<A NAME="827"></A>calm or a contrary wind, to put in at the port of Hercules Monoecus. Near 
<A NAME="828"></A>this place was stationed Marius Maturus, procurator of the Maritime Alps, 
<A NAME="829"></A>who was loyal to Vitellius, and who, though everything around him was hostile, 
<A NAME="830"></A>had not yet thrown off his allegiance. While courteously receiving Valens, 
<A NAME="831"></A>he deterred him by his advice from rashly invading Gallia Narbonensis. 
<A NAME="832"></A>And now the fidelity of the rest of the party was weakened by their fears. 
<A NAME="833"></A>In fact the procurator Valerius Paullinus, an enterprising officer, who 
<A NAME="834"></A>had been a friend of Vespasian before his elevation to the throne, had 
<A NAME="835"></A>made the neighbouring States swear allegiance to that 
<A NAME="836"></A>Prince.
<A NAME="837"></A><BR><BR>Paullinus had collected all the troops who, having been disbanded 
<A NAME="838"></A>by Vitellius, were now spontaneously taking up arms, and was holding with 
<A NAME="839"></A>this force the colony of Forum Julii, which commanded the sea. His influence 
<A NAME="840"></A>was all the greater, because Forum Julii was his native place, and because 
<A NAME="841"></A>he was respected by the Praetorians, in which force he had once been a 
<A NAME="842"></A>tribune. The inhabitants themselves, favouring a fellow-townsman, and anticipating 
<A NAME="843"></A>his future greatness, did their best to promote the cause. When these preparations, 
<A NAME="844"></A>which were really formidable and were exaggerated by report, became known 
<A NAME="845"></A>among the now distracted Vitellianists, Fabius Valens returned to his ships 
<A NAME="846"></A>with four soldiers of the body-guard, three personal friends, and as many 
<A NAME="847"></A>centurions, while Maturus and the rest chose to remain behind and swear 
<A NAME="848"></A>allegiance to Vespasian. For Valens indeed the open sea was safer than 
<A NAME="849"></A>the coast or the towns, yet, all uncertain about the future, and knowing 
<A NAME="850"></A>rather what he must avoid than what he could trust, he was thrown by adverse 
<A NAME="851"></A>weather on the Stoechades, islands off Massilia. There he was captured 
<A NAME="852"></A>by some Liburnian ships, dispatched by Paullinus.
<A NAME="853"></A><BR><BR>Valens once captured, everything turned to swell the resources 
<A NAME="854"></A>of the conqueror; the lead was taken in Spain by the 1st legion (the "Adjutrix"), 
<A NAME="855"></A>whose recollections of Otho made them hate Vitellius; they drew with them 
<A NAME="856"></A>the 6th and 10th. Gaul did not hesitate to follow. A partiality long felt 
<A NAME="857"></A>in Britain for Vespasian, who had there commanded the 2nd legion by the 
<A NAME="858"></A>appointment of Claudius, and had served with distinction, attached that 
<A NAME="859"></A>province to his cause, though not without some commotion among the other 
<A NAME="860"></A>legions, in which were many centurions and soldiers promoted by Vitellius, 
<A NAME="861"></A>who felt uneasy in exchanging for another ruler one whom they knew 
<A NAME="862"></A>already.
<A NAME="863"></A><BR><BR>These dissensions, and the continual rumours of civil war, raised 
<A NAME="864"></A>the courage of the Britons. They were led by one Venutius, who, besides 
<A NAME="865"></A>being naturally high spirited, and hating the name of Rome, was fired by 
<A NAME="866"></A>his private animosity against Queen Cartismandua. Cartismandua ruled the 
<A NAME="867"></A>Brigantes in virtue of her illustrious birth; and she strengthened her 
<A NAME="868"></A>throne, when, by the treacherous capture of king Caractacus, she was regarded 
<A NAME="869"></A>as having given its chief distinction to the triumph of Claudius Caesar. 
<A NAME="870"></A>Then followed wealth and the self-indulgence of prosperity. Spurning her 
<A NAME="871"></A>husband Venutius, she made Vellocatus, his armour-bearer, the partner of 
<A NAME="872"></A>her bed and throne. By this enormity the power of her house was at once 
<A NAME="873"></A>shaken to its base. On the side of the husband were the affections of the 
<A NAME="874"></A>people, on that of the adulterer, the lust and savage temper of the Queen. 
<A NAME="875"></A>Accordingly Venutius collected some auxiliaries, and, aided at the same 
<A NAME="876"></A>time by a revolt of the Brigantes, brought Cartismandua into the utmost 
<A NAME="877"></A>peril. She asked for some Roman troops, and our auxiliary infantry and 
<A NAME="878"></A>cavalry, after fighting with various success, contrived to rescue the Queen 
<A NAME="879"></A>from her peril. Venutius retained the kingdom, and we had the war on our 
<A NAME="880"></A>hands.
<A NAME="881"></A><BR><BR>About the same time, Germany suffered from the supineness of our 
<A NAME="882"></A>generals and the mutinous conduct of our legions; the assaults of enemies 
<A NAME="883"></A>and the perfidy of allies all but overthrew the power of Rome. Of this 
<A NAME="884"></A>war, its origin and its issue, for it lasted long, I shall hereafter speak. 
<A NAME="885"></A>The Dacians also were in motion, a people which never can be trusted, and 
<A NAME="886"></A>which, now that our legions were withdrawn from Moesia, had nothing to 
<A NAME="887"></A>fear. They quietly watched the opening of the campaign, but when they heard 
<A NAME="888"></A>that Italy was in a blaze of war, and that the whole Empire was divided 
<A NAME="889"></A>against itself, they stormed the winter quarters of the auxiliary infantry 
<A NAME="890"></A>and cavalry, and occupied both banks of the Danube. They were then preparing 
<A NAME="891"></A>to destroy the camp of the legions, but Mucianus sent the 6th legion against 
<A NAME="892"></A>them, for he knew of the victory of Cremona, and he feared this double 
<A NAME="893"></A>pressure of barbarian power with Dacians and Germans invading Italy from 
<A NAME="894"></A>opposite sides. We were helped, as often before, by the good fortune of 
<A NAME="895"></A>the Roman people, which brought to the spot Mucianus with the armies of 
<A NAME="896"></A>the East, and by the decisive settlement which in the meantime was effected 
<A NAME="897"></A>at Cremona. Fonteius Agrippa was removed from Asia (which province he had 
<A NAME="898"></A>governed as proconsul for a year) to Moesia, and had some troops given 
<A NAME="899"></A>him from the army of Vitellius. That this army should be dispersed through 
<A NAME="900"></A>the provinces and closely occupied with foreign wars, was sound policy 
<A NAME="901"></A>and essential to peace.
<A NAME="902"></A><BR><BR>All other nations were equally restless. A sudden outbreak had 
<A NAME="903"></A>been excited in Pontus by a barbarian slave, who had before commanded the 
<A NAME="904"></A>royal fleet. This was Anicetus, a freedman of Polemon, once a very powerful 
<A NAME="905"></A>personage, who, when the kingdom was converted into a Roman province, ill 
<A NAME="906"></A>brooked the change. Accordingly he raised in the name of Vitellius the 
<A NAME="907"></A>tribes that border on Pontus, bribed a number of very needy adventurers 
<A NAME="908"></A>by the hope of plunder, and, at the head of a force by no means contemptible, 
<A NAME="909"></A>made a sudden attack on the old and famous city of Trapezus, founded by 
<A NAME="910"></A>the Greeks on the farthest shore of the Pontus. There he destroyed a cohort, 
<A NAME="911"></A>once a part of the royal contingent. They had afterwards received the privileges 
<A NAME="912"></A>of citizenship, and while they carried their arms and banners in Roman 
<A NAME="913"></A>fashion, they still retained the indolence and licence of the Greek. Anicetus 
<A NAME="914"></A>also set fire to the fleet, and, as the sea was not guarded, escaped, for 
<A NAME="915"></A>Mucianus had brought up to Byzantium the best of the Liburnian ships and 
<A NAME="916"></A>all the troops. The barbarians even insolently scoured the sea in hastily 
<A NAME="917"></A>constructed vessels of their own called "camarae," built with narrow sides 
<A NAME="918"></A>and broad bottoms, and joined together without fastenings of brass or iron. 
<A NAME="919"></A>Whenever the water is rough they raise the bulwarks with additional planks 
<A NAME="920"></A>according to the increasing height of the waves, till the vessel is covered 
<A NAME="921"></A>in like a house. Thus they roll about amid the billows, and, as they have 
<A NAME="922"></A>a prow at both extremities alike and a convertible arrangement of oars, 
<A NAME="923"></A>they may be paddled in one direction or another indifferently and without 
<A NAME="924"></A>risk.
<A NAME="925"></A><BR><BR>The matter attracted the attention of Vespasian, and induced him 
<A NAME="926"></A>to dispatch some veterans from the legions under Virdius Geminus, a tried 
<A NAME="927"></A>soldier. Finding the enemy in disorder and dispersed in the eager pursuit 
<A NAME="928"></A>of plunder, he attacked them, and drove them to their ships. Hastily fitting 
<A NAME="929"></A>out a fleet of Liburnian ships he pursued Anicetus, and overtook him at 
<A NAME="930"></A>the mouth of the river Cohibus, where he was protected by the king of the 
<A NAME="931"></A>Sedochezi, whose alliance he had secured by a sum of money and other presents. 
<A NAME="932"></A>This prince at first endeavoured to protect the suppliant by a threat of 
<A NAME="933"></A>hostilities; when, however, the choice was presented to him between war 
<A NAME="934"></A>and the profit to be derived from treachery, he consented, with the characteristic 
<A NAME="935"></A>perfidy of barbarians, to the destruction of Anicetus, and delivered up 
<A NAME="936"></A>the refugees. So ended this servile war. Amidst the joy of this success, 
<A NAME="937"></A>while everything was prosperous beyond his hopes, tidings of the victory 
<A NAME="938"></A>of Cremona reached Vespasian in Aegypt. This made him hasten his advance 
<A NAME="939"></A>to Alexandria, for, now that the army of Vitellius was shattered, he sought 
<A NAME="940"></A>to apply the pressure of famine to the capital, which is always dependent 
<A NAME="941"></A>on foreign supplies. He was indeed also preparing to invade by sea and 
<A NAME="942"></A>land the province of Africa, which lies on the same line of coast, intending 
<A NAME="943"></A>by thus closing the supplies of corn to cause famine and dissension among 
<A NAME="944"></A>the enemy.
<A NAME="945"></A><BR><BR>While with this world-wide convulsion the Imperial power was changing 
<A NAME="946"></A>hands, the conduct of Primus Antonius, after the fall of Cremona, was by 
<A NAME="947"></A>no means as blameless as before. Either he believed that the necessities 
<A NAME="948"></A>of the war had been satisfied, and that all else would follow easily, or, 
<A NAME="949"></A>perhaps, success, working on such a temperament, developed his latent pride, 
<A NAME="950"></A>rapacity and other vices. He swept through Italy as if it were a conquered 
<A NAME="951"></A>country and caressed the legions as if they were his own; by all his words 
<A NAME="952"></A>and acts he sought to pave for himself the way to power. To imbue the army 
<A NAME="953"></A>with a spirit of licence, he offered to the legions the commissions of 
<A NAME="954"></A>the centurions killed in the war. By their vote the most turbulent men 
<A NAME="955"></A>were elected. The soldiers in fact were not under the control of the generals, 
<A NAME="956"></A>but the generals were themselves constrained to follow the furious impulses 
<A NAME="957"></A>of the soldiers. These mutinous proceedings, so ruinous to discipline, 
<A NAME="958"></A>Antonius soon turned to his own profit, regardless of the near approach 
<A NAME="959"></A>of Mucianus, a neglect more fatal than any contempt for 
<A NAME="960"></A>Vespasian.
<A NAME="961"></A><BR><BR>As winter was approaching, and the low country was flooded by the 
<A NAME="962"></A>Padus, the army marched on without its heavy baggage. The standards and 
<A NAME="963"></A>eagles of the victorious legions, the old and wounded soldiers, and even 
<A NAME="964"></A>many effective men, were left at Verona. The auxiliary infantry and cavalry, 
<A NAME="965"></A>with some picked troops from the legions, appeared sufficient for a war 
<A NAME="966"></A>that was all but finished. They had been joined by the 11th legion, which 
<A NAME="967"></A>at first had hesitated, but now in the hour of success felt alarm at having 
<A NAME="968"></A>stood aloof. A recent levy of 6000 Dalmatians was attached to the legion. 
<A NAME="969"></A>They were under the command of Pompeius Silvanus, a man of consular rank; 
<A NAME="970"></A>the real direction of affairs was in the hands of Annius Bassus, the legate 
<A NAME="971"></A>of the legion. This officer contrived, under an appearance of submission, 
<A NAME="972"></A>to govern Silvanus, a leader without vigour, and apt to waste in words 
<A NAME="973"></A>the opportunities of action. Bassus, with his unobtrusive energy, was ready 
<A NAME="974"></A>for everything that had to be done. To these forces were added the elite 
<A NAME="975"></A>of the marines of the Ravenna fleet, who demanded permission to serve in 
<A NAME="976"></A>the legions. The crews were made up with Dalmatians. The army and generals 
<A NAME="977"></A>halted at the Temple of Fortune, undecided as to their line of action. 
<A NAME="978"></A>They had heard that the Praetorian Guard had marched out of Rome, and they 
<A NAME="979"></A>supposed that the Apennines were occupied with troops. The generals, finding 
<A NAME="980"></A>themselves in a country utterly impoverished by war, were terrified by 
<A NAME="981"></A>the scarcity of provisions and the mutinous clamours of the soldiery, who 
<A NAME="982"></A>incessantly demanded the "clavarium," as the donative was called. They 
<A NAME="983"></A>had provided neither money nor corn, and they were embarrassed by the general 
<A NAME="984"></A>impatience and rapacity; for what they might have obtained was 
<A NAME="985"></A>plundered.
<A NAME="986"></A><BR><BR>I have the very highest authority for asserting, that there was 
<A NAME="987"></A>among the conquerors such an impious disregard of right and wrong, that 
<A NAME="988"></A>a private cavalry soldier declared he had slain his brother in the late 
<A NAME="989"></A>battle, and claimed a reward from the generals. The common law of humanity 
<A NAME="990"></A>on the one hand forbade them to reward this act of blood, the necessities 
<A NAME="991"></A>of the war on the other forbade them to punish it. They put him off, on 
<A NAME="992"></A>the ground that the obligation was too great to be immediately discharged. 
<A NAME="993"></A>Nothing more is recorded. In the earlier civil wars indeed a similar horror 
<A NAME="994"></A>had occurred. In the battle with Cinna at the Janiculum, a soldier in Pompey's 
<A NAME="995"></A>army, as Sisenna tells us, slew his own brother, and, on discovering the 
<A NAME="996"></A>horrible deed he had committed, destroyed himself. So much more earnest 
<A NAME="997"></A>among our ancestors was the honour paid to virtue, and the remorse that 
<A NAME="998"></A>waited on crime. These and like instances, drawn from the recollections 
<A NAME="999"></A>of the past, I shall mention not irrelevantly, whenever the subject and 
<A NAME="1000"></A>the occasion shall call for some example of goodness or some solace in 
<A NAME="1001"></A>the presence of evil.
<A NAME="1002"></A><BR><BR>Antonius and the other generals of the party judged it expedient 
<A NAME="1003"></A>to send forward the cavalry and explore the whole of Umbria for some point 
<A NAME="1004"></A>where the Apennines presented a more gentle ascent, and also to bring up 
<A NAME="1005"></A>the eagles and standards and all the troops at Verona, while they were 
<A NAME="1006"></A>to cover the Padus and the sea with convoys. Some there were among the 
<A NAME="1007"></A>generals who were contriving delays, for Antonius in fact was now becoming 
<A NAME="1008"></A>too great a man, and their hopes from Mucianus were more definite. That 
<A NAME="1009"></A>commander, troubled at so speedy a success, and imagining that unless he 
<A NAME="1010"></A>occupied Rome in person he should lose all share in the glory of the war, 
<A NAME="1011"></A>continued to write in ambiguous terms to Varus and Antonius, enlarging 
<A NAME="1012"></A>at one time on the necessity of following up their operations, at another 
<A NAME="1013"></A>on the advantage of delay, and with expressions so worded that he could, 
<A NAME="1014"></A>according to the event, repudiate a disastrous, or claim a successful policy. 
<A NAME="1015"></A>To Plotius Griphus, who had lately been raised by Vespasian to the senatorial 
<A NAME="1016"></A>rank and appointed to command a legion, as well as to all others on whom 
<A NAME="1017"></A>he could fully rely, he gave plainer instructions. All these men sent replies 
<A NAME="1018"></A>reflecting unfavourably on the precipitancy of Varus and Antonius, and 
<A NAME="1019"></A>suiting the wishes of Mucianus. By forwarding these letters to Vespasian 
<A NAME="1020"></A>he had accomplished this much, that the measures and achievements of Antonius 
<A NAME="1021"></A>were not valued according to his hopes.
<A NAME="1022"></A><BR><BR>Antonius was indignant, and blamed Mucianus, whose calumnies had 
<A NAME="1023"></A>depreciated his own hazardous achievements. Nor was he temperate in his 
<A NAME="1024"></A>expressions, for he was habitually violent in language, and was unaccustomed 
<A NAME="1025"></A>to obey. He wrote a letter to Vespasian in terms more arrogant than should 
<A NAME="1026"></A>be addressed to an Emperor, and not without implied reproach against Mucianus. 
<A NAME="1027"></A>"It was I," he said, "who brought into the field the legions of Pannonia; 
<A NAME="1028"></A>my instigations roused the generals in Moesia; my courageous resolution 
<A NAME="1029"></A>forced a passage through the Alps, seized on Italy, and cut off the succours 
<A NAME="1030"></A>from Germany and Rhaetia. The discomfiture of the disunited and scattered 
<A NAME="1031"></A>legions of Vitellius by a fierce charge of cavalry, and afterwards by the 
<A NAME="1032"></A>steady strength of the infantry in a conflict that lasted for a day and 
<A NAME="1033"></A>a night, was indeed a most glorious achievement, and it was my work. For 
<A NAME="1034"></A>the destruction of Cremona the war must be answerable; the civil strifes 
<A NAME="1035"></A>of former days cost the State more terrible loss and the overthrow of many 
<A NAME="1036"></A>cities. Not with messages and letters, but with my arm and my sword, have 
<A NAME="1037"></A>I served my Emperor. I would not seek to hinder the renown of those who 
<A NAME="1038"></A>in the meanwhile have reduced Asia to tranquillity. They had at heart the 
<A NAME="1039"></A>peace of Moesia, I the safety and security of Italy. By my earnest representations 
<A NAME="1040"></A>Gaul and Spain, the most powerful region of the world, have been won for 
<A NAME="1041"></A>Vespasian. But all my efforts have been wasted, if they alone who have 
<A NAME="1042"></A>not shared the peril obtain its rewards." The meaning of all this did not 
<A NAME="1043"></A>escape Mucianus, and there arose a deadly feud, cherished by Antonius with 
<A NAME="1044"></A>frankness, by Mucianus with reserve, and therefore with the greater 
<A NAME="1045"></A>bitterness.
<A NAME="1046"></A><BR><BR>Vitellius, after his power had been shattered at Cremona, endeavoured 
<A NAME="1047"></A>to suppress the tidings of the disaster, and by this foolish attempt at 
<A NAME="1048"></A>concealment he put off, not indeed his troubles, but only the application 
<A NAME="1049"></A>of the remedy. Had he avowed and discussed his position, he had some chance, 
<A NAME="1050"></A>some strength, left; whereas, on the contrary, when he pretended that all 
<A NAME="1051"></A>was prosperous, he aggravated his perils by falsehood. A strange silence 
<A NAME="1052"></A>was observed in his presence as to the war; throughout the country all 
<A NAME="1053"></A>discussion was prohibited, and so, many who would have told the truth had 
<A NAME="1054"></A>it been allowed, finding it forbidden, spread rumours exaggerating the 
<A NAME="1055"></A>calamity. The generals of the enemy failed not to magnify the report of 
<A NAME="1056"></A>their strength, for they sent back any spies of Vitellius whom they captured, 
<A NAME="1057"></A>after conducting them round the camp in order that they might learn the 
<A NAME="1058"></A>force of the victorious army. All of these persons Vitellius questioned 
<A NAME="1059"></A>in secret, and then ordered that they should be put to death. Singular 
<A NAME="1060"></A>bravery was displayed by a centurion, Julius Agrestis, who, after several 
<A NAME="1061"></A>interviews, in which he had in vain endeavoured to rouse Vitellius to courage, 
<A NAME="1062"></A>prevailed on the Emperor to send him in person to see what was the strength 
<A NAME="1063"></A>of the enemy's resources, and what had happened at Cremona. He did not 
<A NAME="1064"></A>seek to escape the notice of Antonius by making his observations in secret, 
<A NAME="1065"></A>but avowed the emperor's instructions and his own purpose, and asked leave 
<A NAME="1066"></A>to see everything. Persons were sent to shew him the field of battle, the 
<A NAME="1067"></A>remains of Cremona, and the captured legions. He then made his way back 
<A NAME="1068"></A>to Vitellius, and when the Emperor denied the truth of the intelligence 
<A NAME="1069"></A>which he brought, and even charged him with having been bribed, "Since," 
<A NAME="1070"></A>he replied, "you require some decisive proof, and I can no longer serve 
<A NAME="1071"></A>you in any other way either by my life or death I will give you a proof 
<A NAME="1072"></A>which you can believe." So he departed, and confirmed his statement by 
<A NAME="1073"></A>a voluntary death. Some say that he was slain by order of Vitellius,
