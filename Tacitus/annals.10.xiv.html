<A NAME="10"></A>A.D. 59-62
<A NAME="11"></A><BR><BR>In the year of the consulship of Caius Vipstanus and Caius Fonteius, 
<A NAME="12"></A>Nero deferred no more a long meditated crime. Length of power had matured 
<A NAME="13"></A>his daring, and his passion for Poppaea daily grew more ardent. As the 
<A NAME="14"></A>woman had no hope of marriage for herself or of Octavia's divorce while 
<A NAME="15"></A>Agrippina lived, she would reproach the emperor with incessant vituperation 
<A NAME="16"></A>and sometimes call him in jest a mere ward who was under the rule of others, 
<A NAME="17"></A>and was so far from having empire that he had not even his liberty. "Why," 
<A NAME="18"></A>she asked, "was her marriage put off? Was it, forsooth, her beauty and 
<A NAME="19"></A>her ancestors, with their triumphal honours, that failed to please, or 
<A NAME="20"></A>her being a mother, and her sincere heart? No; the fear was that as a wife 
<A NAME="21"></A>at least she would divulge the wrongs of the Senate, and the wrath of the 
<A NAME="22"></A>people at the arrogance and rapacity of his mother. If the only daughter-in-law 
<A NAME="23"></A>Agrippina could bear was one who wished evil to her son, let her be restored 
<A NAME="24"></A>to her union with Otho. She would go anywhere in the world, where she might 
<A NAME="25"></A>hear of the insults heaped on the emperor, rather than witness them, and 
<A NAME="26"></A>be also involved in his perils."
<A NAME="27"></A><BR><BR>These and the like complaints, rendered impressive by tears and 
<A NAME="28"></A>by the cunning of an adulteress, no one checked, as all longed to see the 
<A NAME="29"></A>mother's power broken, while not a person believed that the son's hatred 
<A NAME="30"></A>would steel his heart to her murder.
<A NAME="31"></A><BR><BR>Cluvius relates that Agrippina in her eagerness to retain her influence 
<A NAME="32"></A>went so far that more than once at midday, when Nero, even at that hour, 
<A NAME="33"></A>was flushed with wine and feasting, she presented herself attractively 
<A NAME="34"></A>attired to her half intoxicated son and offered him her person, and that 
<A NAME="35"></A>when kinsfolk observed wanton kisses and caresses, portending infamy, it 
<A NAME="36"></A>was Seneca who sought a female's aid against a woman's fascinations, and 
<A NAME="37"></A>hurried in Acte, the freed-girl, who alarmed at her own peril and at Nero's 
<A NAME="38"></A>disgrace, told him that the incest was notorious, as his mother boasted 
<A NAME="39"></A>of it, and that the soldiers would never endure the rule of an impious 
<A NAME="40"></A>sovereign. Fabius Rusticus tells us that it was not Agrippina, but Nero, 
<A NAME="41"></A>who lusted for the crime, and that it was frustrated by the adroitness 
<A NAME="42"></A>of that same freed-girl. Cluvius's account, however, is also that of all 
<A NAME="43"></A>other authors, and popular belief inclines to it, whether it was that Agrippina 
<A NAME="44"></A>really conceived such a monstrous wickedness in her heart, or perhaps because 
<A NAME="45"></A>the thought of a strange passion seemed comparatively credible in a woman, 
<A NAME="46"></A>who in her girlish years had allowed herself to be seduced by Lepidus in 
<A NAME="47"></A>the hope of winning power, had stooped with a like ambition to the lust 
<A NAME="48"></A>of Pallas, and had trained herself for every infamy by her marriage with 
<A NAME="49"></A>her uncle.
<A NAME="50"></A><BR><BR>Nero accordingly avoided secret interviews with her, and when she 
<A NAME="51"></A>withdrew to her gardens or to her estates at Tusculum and Antium, he praised 
<A NAME="52"></A>her for courting repose. At last, convinced that she would be too formidable, 
<A NAME="53"></A>wherever she might dwell, he resolved to destroy her, merely deliberating 
<A NAME="54"></A>whether it was to be accomplished by poison, or by the sword, or by any 
<A NAME="55"></A>other violent means. Poison at first seemed best, but, were it to be administered 
<A NAME="56"></A>at the imperial table, the result could not be referred to chance after 
<A NAME="57"></A>the recent circumstances of the death of Britannicus. Again, to tamper 
<A NAME="58"></A>with the servants of a woman who, from her familiarity with crime, was 
<A NAME="59"></A>on her guard against treachery, appeared to be extremely difficult, and 
<A NAME="60"></A>then, too, she had fortified her constitution by the use of antidotes. 
<A NAME="61"></A>How again the dagger and its work were to be kept secret, no one could 
<A NAME="62"></A>suggest, and it was feared too that whoever might be chosen to execute 
<A NAME="63"></A>such a crime would spurn the order.
<A NAME="64"></A><BR><BR>An ingenious suggestion was offered by Anicetus, a freedman, commander 
<A NAME="65"></A>of the fleet at Misenum, who had been tutor to Nero in boyhood and had 
<A NAME="66"></A>a hatred of Agrippina which she reciprocated. He explained that a vessel 
<A NAME="67"></A>could be constructed, from which a part might by a contrivance be detached, 
<A NAME="68"></A>when out at sea, so as to plunge her unawares into the water. "Nothing," 
<A NAME="69"></A>he said, "allowed of accidents so much as the sea, and should she be overtaken 
<A NAME="70"></A>by shipwreck, who would be so unfair as to impute to crime an offence committed 
<A NAME="71"></A>by the winds and waves? The emperor would add the honour of a temple and 
<A NAME="72"></A>of shrines to the deceased lady, with every other display of filial 
<A NAME="73"></A>affection."
<A NAME="74"></A><BR><BR>Nero liked the device, favoured as it also was by the particular 
<A NAME="75"></A>time, for he was celebrating Minerva's five days' festival at Baiae. Thither 
<A NAME="76"></A>he enticed his mother by repeated assurances that children ought to bear 
<A NAME="77"></A>with the irritability of parents and to soothe their tempers, wishing thus 
<A NAME="78"></A>to spread a rumour of reconciliation and to secure Agrippina's acceptance 
<A NAME="79"></A>through the feminine credulity, which easily believes what joy. As she 
<A NAME="80"></A>approached, he went to the shore to meet her (she was coming from Antium), 
<A NAME="81"></A>welcomed her with outstretched hand and embrace, and conducted her to Bauli. 
<A NAME="82"></A>This was the name of a country house, washed by a bay of the sea, between 
<A NAME="83"></A>the promontory of Misenum and the lake of Baiae. Here was a vessel distinguished 
<A NAME="84"></A>from others by its equipment, seemingly meant, among other things, to do 
<A NAME="85"></A>honour to his mother; for she had been accustomed to sail in a trireme, 
<A NAME="86"></A>with a crew of marines. And now she was invited to a banquet, that night 
<A NAME="87"></A>might serve to conceal the crime. It was well known that somebody had been 
<A NAME="88"></A>found to betray it, that Agrippina had heard of the plot, and in doubt 
<A NAME="89"></A>whether she was to believe it, was conveyed to Baiae in her litter. There 
<A NAME="90"></A>some soothing words allayed her fear; she was graciously received, and 
<A NAME="91"></A>seated at table above the emperor. Nero prolonged the banquet with various 
<A NAME="92"></A>conversation, passing from a youth's playful familiarity to an air of constraint, 
<A NAME="93"></A>which seemed to indicate serious thought, and then, after protracted festivity, 
<A NAME="94"></A>escorted her on her departure, clinging with kisses to her eyes and bosom, 
<A NAME="95"></A>either to crown his hypocrisy or because the last sight of a mother on 
<A NAME="96"></A>the even of destruction caused a lingering even in that brutal 
<A NAME="97"></A>heart.
<A NAME="98"></A><BR><BR>A night of brilliant starlight with the calm of a tranquil sea 
<A NAME="99"></A>was granted by heaven, seemingly, to convict the crime. The vessel had 
<A NAME="100"></A>not gone far, Agrippina having with her two of her intimate attendants, 
<A NAME="101"></A>one of whom, Crepereius Gallus, stood near the helm, while Acerronia, reclining 
<A NAME="102"></A>at Agrippina's feet as she reposed herself, spoke joyfully of her son's 
<A NAME="103"></A>repentance and of the recovery of the mother's influence, when at a given 
<A NAME="104"></A>signal the ceiling of the place, which was loaded with a quantity of lead, 
<A NAME="105"></A>fell in, and Crepereius was crushed and instantly killed. Agrippina and 
<A NAME="106"></A>Acerronia were protected by the projecting sides of the couch, which happened 
<A NAME="107"></A>to be too strong to yield under the weight. But this was not followed by 
<A NAME="108"></A>the breaking up of the vessel; for all were bewildered, and those too, 
<A NAME="109"></A>who were in the plot, were hindered by the unconscious majority. The crew 
<A NAME="110"></A>then thought it best to throw the vessel on one side and so sink it, but 
<A NAME="111"></A>they could not themselves promptly unite to face the emergency, and others, 
<A NAME="112"></A>by counteracting the attempt, gave an opportunity of a gentler fall into 
<A NAME="113"></A>the sea. Acerronia, however, thoughtlessly exclaiming that she was Agrippina, 
<A NAME="114"></A>and imploring help for the emperor's mother, was despatched with poles 
<A NAME="115"></A>and oars, and such naval implements as chance offered. Agrippina was silent 
<A NAME="116"></A>and was thus the less recognized; still, she received a wound in her shoulder. 
<A NAME="117"></A>She swam, then met with some small boats which conveyed her to the Lucrine 
<A NAME="118"></A>lake, and so entered her house.
<A NAME="119"></A><BR><BR>There she reflected how for this very purpose she had been invited 
<A NAME="120"></A>by a lying letter and treated with conspicuous honour, how also it was 
<A NAME="121"></A>near the shore, not from being driven by winds or dashed on rocks, that 
<A NAME="122"></A>the vessel had in its upper part collapsed, like a mechanism anything but 
<A NAME="123"></A>nautical. She pondered too the death of Acerronia; she looked at her own 
<A NAME="124"></A>wound, and saw that her only safeguard against treachery was to ignore 
<A NAME="125"></A>it. Then she sent her freedman Agerinus to tell her son how by heaven's 
<A NAME="126"></A>favour and his good fortune she had escaped a terrible disaster; that she 
<A NAME="127"></A>begged him, alarmed, as he might be, by his mother's peril, to put off 
<A NAME="128"></A>the duty of a visit, as for the present she needed repose. Meanwhile, pretending 
<A NAME="129"></A>that she felt secure, she applied remedies to her wound, and fomentations 
<A NAME="130"></A>to her person. She then ordered search to be made for the will of Acerronia, 
<A NAME="131"></A>and her property to be sealed, in this alone throwing off 
<A NAME="132"></A>disguise.
<A NAME="133"></A><BR><BR>Nero, meantime, as he waited for tidings of the consummation of 
<A NAME="134"></A>the deed, received information that she had escaped with the injury of 
<A NAME="135"></A>a slight wound, after having so far encountered the peril that there could 
<A NAME="136"></A>be no question as to its author. Then, paralysed with terror and protesting 
<A NAME="137"></A>that she would show herself the next moment eager for vengeance, either 
<A NAME="138"></A>arming the slaves or stirring up the soldiery, or hastening to the Senate 
<A NAME="139"></A>and the people, to charge him with the wreck, with her wound, and with 
<A NAME="140"></A>the destruction of her friends, he asked what resource he had against all 
<A NAME="141"></A>this, unless something could be at once devised by Burrus and Seneca. He 
<A NAME="142"></A>had instantly summoned both of them, and possibly they were already in 
<A NAME="143"></A>the secret. There was a long silence on their part; they feared they might 
<A NAME="144"></A>remonstrate in vain, or believed the crisis to be such that Nero must perish, 
<A NAME="145"></A>unless Agrippina were at once crushed. Thereupon Seneca was so far the 
<A NAME="146"></A>more prompt as to glance back on Burrus, as if to ask him whether the bloody 
<A NAME="147"></A>deed must be required of the soldiers. Burrus replied "that the praetorians 
<A NAME="148"></A>were attached to the whole family of the Caesars, and remembering Germanicus 
<A NAME="149"></A>would not dare a savage deed on his offspring. It was for Anicetus to accomplish 
<A NAME="150"></A>his promise."
<A NAME="151"></A><BR><BR>Anicetus, without a pause, claimed for himself the consummation 
<A NAME="152"></A>of the crime. At those words, Nero declared that that day gave him empire, 
<A NAME="153"></A>and that a freedman was the author of this mighty boon. "Go," he said, 
<A NAME="154"></A>"with all speed and take with you the men readiest to execute your orders." 
<A NAME="155"></A>He himself, when he had heard of the arrival of Agrippina's messenger, 
<A NAME="156"></A>Agerinus, contrived a theatrical mode of accusation, and, while the man 
<A NAME="157"></A>was repeating his message, threw down a sword at his feet, then ordered 
<A NAME="158"></A>him to be put in irons, as a detected criminal, so that he might invent 
<A NAME="159"></A>a story how his mother had plotted the emperor's destruction and in the 
<A NAME="160"></A>shame of discovered guilt had by her own choice sought 
<A NAME="161"></A>death.
<A NAME="162"></A><BR><BR>Meantime, Agrippina's peril being universally known and taken to 
<A NAME="163"></A>be an accidental occurrence, everybody, the moment he heard of it, hurried 
<A NAME="164"></A>down to the beach. Some climbed projecting piers; some the nearest vessels; 
<A NAME="165"></A>others, as far as their stature allowed, went into the sea; some, again, 
<A NAME="166"></A>stood with outstretched arms, while the whole shore rung with wailings, 
<A NAME="167"></A>with prayers and cries, as different questions were asked and uncertain 
<A NAME="168"></A>answers given. A vast multitude streamed to the spot with torches, and 
<A NAME="169"></A>as soon as all knew that she was safe, they at once prepared to wish her 
<A NAME="170"></A>joy, till the sight of an armed and threatening force scared them away. 
<A NAME="171"></A>Anicetus then surrounded the house with a guard, and having burst open 
<A NAME="172"></A>the gates, dragged off the slaves who met him, till he came to the door 
<A NAME="173"></A>of her chamber, where a few still stood, after the rest had fled in terror 
<A NAME="174"></A>at the attack. A small lamp was in the room, and one slave-girl with Agrippina, 
<A NAME="175"></A>who grew more and more anxious, as no messenger came from her son, not 
<A NAME="176"></A>even Agerinus, while the appearance of the shore was changed, a solitude 
<A NAME="177"></A>one moment, then sudden bustle and tokens of the worst catastrophe. As 
<A NAME="178"></A>the girl rose to depart, she exclaimed, "Do you too forsake me?" and looking 
<A NAME="179"></A>round saw Anicetus, who had with him the captain of the trireme, Herculeius, 
<A NAME="180"></A>and Obaritus, a centurion of marines. "If," said she, "you have come to 
<A NAME="181"></A>see me, take back word that I have recovered, but if you are here to do 
<A NAME="182"></A>a crime, I believe nothing about my son; he has not ordered his mother's 
<A NAME="183"></A>murder."
<A NAME="184"></A><BR><BR>The assassins closed in round her couch, and the captain of the 
<A NAME="185"></A>trireme first struck her head violently with a club. Then, as the centurion 
<A NAME="186"></A>bared his sword for the fatal deed, presenting her person, she exclaimed, 
<A NAME="187"></A>"Smite my womb," and with many wounds she was slain.
<A NAME="188"></A><BR><BR>So far our accounts agree. That Nero gazed on his mother after 
<A NAME="189"></A>her death and praised her beauty, some have related, while others deny 
<A NAME="190"></A>it. Her body was burnt that same night on a dining couch, with a mean funeral; 
<A NAME="191"></A>nor, as long as Nero was in power, was the earth raised into a mound, or 
<A NAME="192"></A>even decently closed. Subsequently, she received from the solicitude of 
<A NAME="193"></A>her domestics, a humble sepulchre on the road to Misenum, near the country 
<A NAME="194"></A>house of Caesar the Dictator, which from a great height commands a view 
<A NAME="195"></A>of the bay beneath. As soon as the funeral pile was lighted, one of her 
<A NAME="196"></A>freedmen, surnamed Mnester, ran himself through with a sword, either from 
<A NAME="197"></A>love of his mistress or from the fear of destruction.
<A NAME="198"></A><BR><BR>Many years before Agrippina had anticipated this end for herself 
<A NAME="199"></A>and had spurned the thought. For when she consulted the astrologers about 
<A NAME="200"></A>Nero, they replied that he would be emperor and kill his mother. "Let him 
<A NAME="201"></A>kill her," she said, "provided he is emperor."
<A NAME="202"></A><BR><BR>But the emperor, when the crime was at last accomplished, realised 
<A NAME="203"></A>its portentous guilt. The rest of the night, now silent and stupified, 
<A NAME="204"></A>now and still oftener starting up in terror, bereft of reason, he awaited 
<A NAME="205"></A>the dawn as if it would bring with it his doom. He was first encouraged 
<A NAME="206"></A>to hope by the flattery addressed to him, at the prompting of Burrus, by 
<A NAME="207"></A>the centurions and tribunes, who again and again pressed his hand and congratulated 
<A NAME="208"></A>him on his having escaped an unforeseen danger and his mother's daring 
<A NAME="209"></A>crime. Then his friends went to the temples, and, an example having once 
<A NAME="210"></A>been set, the neighbouring towns of Campania testified their joy with sacrifices 
<A NAME="211"></A>and deputations. He himself, with an opposite phase of hypocrisy, seemed 
<A NAME="212"></A>sad, and almost angry at his own deliverance, and shed tears over his mother's 
<A NAME="213"></A>death. But as the aspects of places change not, as do the looks of men, 
<A NAME="214"></A>and as he had ever before his eyes the dreadful sight of that sea with 
<A NAME="215"></A>its shores (some too believed that the notes of a funereal trumpet were 
<A NAME="216"></A>heard from the surrounding heights, and wailings from the mother's grave), 
<A NAME="217"></A>he retired to Neapolis and sent a letter to the Senate, the drift of which 
<A NAME="218"></A>was that Agerinus, one of Agrippina's confidential freedmen, had been detected 
<A NAME="219"></A>with the dagger of an assassin, and that in the consciousness of having 
<A NAME="220"></A>planned the crime she had paid its penalty.
<A NAME="221"></A><BR><BR>He even revived the charges of a period long past, how she had 
<A NAME="222"></A>aimed at a share of empire, and at inducing the praetorian cohorts to swear 
<A NAME="223"></A>obedience to a woman, to the disgrace of the Senate and people; how, when 
<A NAME="224"></A>she was disappointed, in her fury with the soldiers, the Senate, and the 
<A NAME="225"></A>populace, she opposed the usual donative and largess, and organised perilous 
<A NAME="226"></A>prosecutions against distinguished citizens. What efforts had it cost him 
<A NAME="227"></A>to hinder her from bursting into the Senate-house and giving answers to 
<A NAME="228"></A>foreign nations! He glanced too with indirect censure at the days of Claudius, 
<A NAME="229"></A>and ascribed all the abominations of that reign to his mother, thus seeking 
<A NAME="230"></A>to show that it was the State's good fortune which had destroyed her. For 
<A NAME="231"></A>he actually told the story of the shipwreck; but who could be so stupid 
<A NAME="232"></A>as to believe that it was accidental, or that a shipwrecked woman had sent 
<A NAME="233"></A>one man with a weapon to break through an emperor's guards and fleets? 
<A NAME="234"></A>So now it was not Nero, whose brutality was far beyond any remonstrance, 
<A NAME="235"></A>but Seneca who was in ill repute, for having written a confession in such 
<A NAME="236"></A>a style.
<A NAME="237"></A><BR><BR>Still there was a marvellous rivalry among the nobles in decreeing 
<A NAME="238"></A>thanksgivings at all the shrines, and the celebration with annual games 
<A NAME="239"></A>of Minerva's festival, as the day on which the plot had been discovered; 
<A NAME="240"></A>also, that a golden image of Minerva with a statue of the emperor by its 
<A NAME="241"></A>side should be set up in the Senate-house, and that Agrippina's birthday 
<A NAME="242"></A>should be classed among the inauspicious days. Thrasea Paetus, who had 
<A NAME="243"></A>been used to pass over previous flatteries in silence or with brief assent, 
<A NAME="244"></A>then walked out of the Senate, thereby imperilling himself, without communicating 
<A NAME="245"></A>to the other senators any impulse towards freedom.
<A NAME="246"></A><BR><BR>There occurred too a thick succession of portents, which meant 
<A NAME="247"></A>nothing. A woman gave birth to a snake, and another was killed by a thunderbolt 
<A NAME="248"></A>in her husband's embrace. Then the sun was suddenly darkened and the fourteen 
<A NAME="249"></A>districts of the city were struck by lightning. All this happened quite 
<A NAME="250"></A>without any providential design; so much so, that for many subsequent years 
<A NAME="251"></A>Nero prolonged his reign and his crimes. Still, to deepen the popular hatred 
<A NAME="252"></A>towards his mother, and prove that since her removal, his clemency had 
<A NAME="253"></A>increased, he restored to their ancestral homes two distinguished ladies, 
<A NAME="254"></A>Junia and Calpurnia, with two ex-praetors, Valerius Capito and Licinius 
<A NAME="255"></A>Gabolus, whom Agrippina had formerly banished. He also allowed the ashes 
<A NAME="256"></A>of Lollia Paulina to be brought back and a tomb to be built over them. 
<A NAME="257"></A>Iturius and Calvisius, whom he had himself temporarily exiled, he now released 
<A NAME="258"></A>from their penalty. Silana indeed had died a natural death at Tarentum, 
<A NAME="259"></A>whither she had returned from her distant exile, when the power of Agrippina, 
<A NAME="260"></A>to whose enmity she owed her fall, began to totter, or her wrath was at 
<A NAME="261"></A>last appeased.
<A NAME="262"></A><BR><BR>While Nero was lingering in the towns of Campania, doubting how 
<A NAME="263"></A>he should enter Rome, whether he would find the Senate submissive and the 
<A NAME="264"></A>populace enthusiastic, all the vilest courtiers, and of these never had 
<A NAME="265"></A>a court a more abundant crop, argued against his hesitation by assuring 
<A NAME="266"></A>him that Agrippina's name was hated and that her death had heightened his 
<A NAME="267"></A>popularity. "He might go without a fear," they said, "and experience in 
<A NAME="268"></A>his person men's veneration for him." They insisted at the same time on 
<A NAME="269"></A>preceding him. They found greater enthusiasm than they had promised, the 
<A NAME="270"></A>tribes coming forth to meet him, the Senate in holiday attire, troops of 
<A NAME="271"></A>their children and wives arranged according to sex and age, tiers of seats 
<A NAME="272"></A>raised for the spectacle, where he was to pass, as a triumph is witnessed. 
<A NAME="273"></A>Thus elated and exulting over his people's slavery, he proceeded to the 
<A NAME="274"></A>Capitol, performed the thanksgiving, and then plunged into all the excesses, 
<A NAME="275"></A>which, though ill-restrained, some sort of respect for his mother had for 
<A NAME="276"></A>a while delayed.
<A NAME="277"></A><BR><BR>He had long had a fancy for driving a four-horse chariot, and a 
<A NAME="278"></A>no less degrading taste for singing to the harp, in a theatrical fashion, 
<A NAME="279"></A>when he was at dinner. This he would remind people was a royal custom, 
<A NAME="280"></A>and had been the practice of ancient chiefs; it was celebrated too in the 
<A NAME="281"></A>praises of poets and was meant to show honour to the gods. Songs indeed, 
<A NAME="282"></A>he said, were sacred to Apollo, and it was in the dress of a singer that 
<A NAME="283"></A>that great and prophetic deity was seen in Roman temples as well as in 
<A NAME="284"></A>Greek cities. He could no longer be restrained, when Seneca and Burrus 
<A NAME="285"></A>thought it best to concede one point that he might not persist in both. 
<A NAME="286"></A>A space was enclosed in the Vatican valley where he might manage his horses, 
<A NAME="287"></A>without the spectacle being public. Soon he actually invited all the people 
<A NAME="288"></A>of Rome, who extolled him in their praises, like a mob which craves for 
<A NAME="289"></A>amusements and rejoices when a prince draws them the same way. However, 
<A NAME="290"></A>the public exposure of his shame acted on him as an incentive instead of 
<A NAME="291"></A>sickening him, as men expected. Imagining that he mitigated the scandal 
<A NAME="292"></A>by disgracing many others, he brought on the stage descendants of noble 
<A NAME="293"></A>families, who sold themselves because they were paupers. As they have ended 
<A NAME="294"></A>their days, I think it due to their ancestors not to hand down their names. 
<A NAME="295"></A>And indeed the infamy is his who gave them wealth to reward their degradation 
<A NAME="296"></A>rather than to deter them from degrading themselves. He prevailed too on 
<A NAME="297"></A>some well-known Roman knights, by immense presents, to offer their services 
<A NAME="298"></A>in the amphitheatre; only pay from one who is able to command, carries 
<A NAME="299"></A>with it the force of compulsion.
<A NAME="300"></A><BR><BR>Still, not yet wishing to disgrace himself on a public stage, he 
<A NAME="301"></A>instituted some games under the title of "juvenile sports," for which people 
<A NAME="302"></A>of every class gave in their names. Neither rank nor age nor previous high 
<A NAME="303"></A>promotion hindered any one from practising the art of a Greek or Latin 
<A NAME="304"></A>actor and even stooping to gestures and songs unfit for a man. Noble ladies 
<A NAME="305"></A>too actually played disgusting parts, and in the grove, with which Augustus 
<A NAME="306"></A>had surrounded the lake for the naval fight, there were erected places 
<A NAME="307"></A>for meeting and refreshment, and every incentive to excess was offered 
<A NAME="308"></A>for sale. Money too was distributed, which the respectable had to spend 
<A NAME="309"></A>under sheer compulsion and which the profligate gloried in squandering. 
<A NAME="310"></A>Hence a rank growth of abominations and of all infamy. Never did a more 
<A NAME="311"></A>filthy rabble add a worse licentiousness to our long corrupted morals. 
<A NAME="312"></A>Even, with virtuous training, purity is not easily upheld; far less amid 
<A NAME="313"></A>rivalries in vice could modesty or propriety or any trace of good manners 
<A NAME="314"></A>be preserved. Last of all, the emperor himself came on the stage, tuning 
<A NAME="315"></A>his lute with elaborate care and trying his voice with his attendants. 
<A NAME="316"></A>There were also present, to complete the show, a guard of soldiers with 
<A NAME="317"></A>centurions and tribunes, and Burrus, who grieved and yet applauded. Then 
<A NAME="318"></A>it was that Roman knights were first enrolled under the title of Augustani, 
<A NAME="319"></A>men in their prime and remarkable for their strength, some, from a natural 
<A NAME="320"></A>frivolity, others from the hope of promotion. Day and night they kept up 
<A NAME="321"></A>a thunder of applause, and applied to the emperor's person and voice the 
<A NAME="322"></A>epithets of deities. Thus they lived in fame and honour, as if on the strength 
<A NAME="323"></A>of their merits.
<A NAME="324"></A><BR><BR>Nero however, that he might not be known only for his accomplishments 
<A NAME="325"></A>as an actor, also affected a taste for poetry, and drew round him persons 
<A NAME="326"></A>who had some skill in such compositions, but not yet generally recognised. 
<A NAME="327"></A>They used to sit with him, stringing together verses prepared at home, 
<A NAME="328"></A>or extemporised on the spot, and fill up his own expressions, such as they 
<A NAME="329"></A>were, just as he threw them off. This is plainly shown by the very character 
<A NAME="330"></A>of the poems, which have no vigour or inspiration, or unity in their 
<A NAME="331"></A>flow.
<A NAME="332"></A><BR><BR>He would also bestow some leisure after his banquets on the teachers 
<A NAME="333"></A>of philosophy, for he enjoyed the wrangles of opposing dogmatists. And 
<A NAME="334"></A>some there were who liked to exhibit their gloomy faces and looks, as one 
<A NAME="335"></A>of the amusements of the court.
<A NAME="336"></A><BR><BR>About the same time a trifling beginning led to frightful bloodshed 
<A NAME="337"></A>between the inhabitants of Nuceria and Pompeii, at a gladiatorial show 
<A NAME="338"></A>exhibited by Livineius Regulus, who had been, as I have related, expelled 
<A NAME="339"></A>from the Senate. With the unruly spirit of townsfolk, they began with abusive 
<A NAME="340"></A>language of each other; then they took up stones and at last weapons, the 
<A NAME="341"></A>advantage resting with the populace of Pompeii, where the show was being 
<A NAME="342"></A>exhibited. And so there were brought to Rome a number of the people of 
<A NAME="343"></A>Nuceria, with their bodies mutilated by wounds, and many lamented the deaths 
<A NAME="344"></A>of children or of parents. The emperor entrusted the trial of the case 
<A NAME="345"></A>to the Senate, and the Senate to the consuls, and then again the matter 
<A NAME="346"></A>being referred back to the Senators, the inhabitants of Pompeii were forbidden 
<A NAME="347"></A>to have any such public gathering for ten years, and all associations they 
<A NAME="348"></A>had formed in defiance of the laws were dissolved. Livineius and the others 
<A NAME="349"></A>who had excited the disturbance, were punished with 
<A NAME="350"></A>exile.
<A NAME="351"></A><BR><BR>Pedius Blaesus was also expelled from the Senate on the accusation 
<A NAME="352"></A>of the people of Cyrene, that he had violated the treasury of Aesculapius 
<A NAME="353"></A>and had tampered with a military levy by bribery and corruption. This same 
<A NAME="354"></A>people prosecuted Acilius Strabo who had held the office of praetor, and 
<A NAME="355"></A>had been sent by Claudius to adjudicate on some lands which were bequeathed 
<A NAME="356"></A>by king Apion, their former possessor, together with his kingdom to the 
<A NAME="357"></A>Roman people, and which had since been seized by the neighbouring proprietors, 
<A NAME="358"></A>who trusted to a long continued licence in wrong, as if it constituted 
<A NAME="359"></A>right and justice. Consequently, when the adjudication was against them, 
<A NAME="360"></A>there arose a bitter feeling towards the judge, but the Senate replied 
<A NAME="361"></A>that they knew nothing of the instructions given by Claudius, and that 
<A NAME="362"></A>the emperor must be consulted. Nero, though he approved Strabo's decision, 
<A NAME="363"></A>wrote word that nevertheless he was for relieving the allies, and that 
<A NAME="364"></A>he waived all claim to what had been taken into possession.
<A NAME="365"></A><BR><BR>Then followed the deaths of two illustrious men, Domitius Afer 
<A NAME="366"></A>and Marcus Servilius, who had flourished through a career of the highest 
<A NAME="367"></A>honours and great eloquence. The first was a pleader; Servilius, after 
<A NAME="368"></A>long practice in the courts, distinguished himself by his history of Rome 
<A NAME="369"></A>and by the refinement of his life, which the contrast of his character 
<A NAME="370"></A>to that of Afer, whom he equalled in genius, rendered the more 
<A NAME="371"></A>conspicuous.
<A NAME="372"></A><BR><BR>In Nero's fourth consulship with Cornelius Cossus for his colleague, 
<A NAME="373"></A>a theatrical entertainment to be repeated every five years was established 
<A NAME="374"></A>at Rome in imitation of the Greek festival. Like all novelties, it was 
<A NAME="375"></A>variously canvassed. There were some who declared that even Cnius Pompeius 
<A NAME="376"></A>was censured by the older men of the day for having set up a fixed and 
<A NAME="377"></A>permanent theatre. "Formerly," they said, "the games were usually exhibited 
<A NAME="378"></A>with hastily erected tiers of benches and a temporary stage, and the people 
<A NAME="379"></A>stood to witness them, that they might not, by having the chance of sitting 
<A NAME="380"></A>down, spend a succession of entire days in idleness. Let the ancient character 
<A NAME="381"></A>of these shows be retained, whenever the praetors exhibited them, and let 
<A NAME="382"></A>no citizen be under the necessity of competing. As it was, the morality 
<A NAME="383"></A>of their fathers, which had by degrees been forgotten, was utterly subverted 
<A NAME="384"></A>by the introduction of a lax tone, so that all which could suffer or produce 
<A NAME="385"></A>corruption was to be seen at Rome, and a degeneracy bred by foreign tastes 
<A NAME="386"></A>was infecting the youth who devoted themselves to athletic sports, to idle 
<A NAME="387"></A>loungings and low intrigues, with the encouragement of the emperor and 
<A NAME="388"></A>Senate, who not only granted licence to vice, but even applied a compulsion 
<A NAME="389"></A>to drive Roman nobles into disgracing themselves on the stage, under the 
<A NAME="390"></A>pretence of being orators and poets. What remained for them but to strip 
<A NAME="391"></A>themselves naked, put on the boxing-glove, and practise such battles instead 
<A NAME="392"></A>of the arms of legitimate warfare? Would justice be promoted, or would 
<A NAME="393"></A>they serve on the knights' commissions for the honourable office of a judge, 
<A NAME="394"></A>because they had listened with critical sagacity to effeminate strains 
<A NAME="395"></A>of music and sweet voices? Night too was given up to infamy, so that virtue 
<A NAME="396"></A>had not a moment left to her, but all the vilest of that promiscuous throng 
<A NAME="397"></A>dared to do in the darkness anything they had lusted for in the 
<A NAME="398"></A>day."
<A NAME="399"></A><BR><BR>Many people liked this very licence, but they screened it under 
<A NAME="400"></A>respectable names. "Our ancestors," they said, "were not averse to the 
<A NAME="401"></A>attractions of shows on a scale suited to the wealth of their day, and 
<A NAME="402"></A>so they introduced actors from the Etruscans and horse-races from Thurii. 
<A NAME="403"></A>When we had possessed ourselves of Achaia and Asia, games were exhibited 
<A NAME="404"></A>with greater elaboration, and yet no one at Rome of good family had stooped 
<A NAME="405"></A>to the theatrical profession during the 200 years following the triumph 
<A NAME="406"></A>of Lucius Mummius, who first displayed this kind of show in the capital. 
<A NAME="407"></A>Besides, even economy had been consulted, when a permanent edifice was 
<A NAME="408"></A>erected for a theatre, in preference to a structure raised and fitted up 
<A NAME="409"></A>yearly at vast expense. Nor would the magistrates, as hitherto, exhaust 
<A NAME="410"></A>their substance, or would the populace have the same motive for demanding 
<A NAME="411"></A>of them the Greek contests, when once the State undertakes the expenditure. 
<A NAME="412"></A>The victories won by orators and poets would furnish a stimulus to genius, 
<A NAME="413"></A>and it could not be a burden for any judge to bestow his attention on graceful 
<A NAME="414"></A>pursuits or on legitimate recreations. It was to mirth rather than to profligacy 
<A NAME="415"></A>that a few nights every five years were devoted, and in these amid such 
<A NAME="416"></A>a blaze of illumination no lawless conduct could be 
<A NAME="417"></A>concealed."
<A NAME="418"></A><BR><BR>This entertainment, it is true, passed off without any notorious 
<A NAME="419"></A>scandal. The enthusiasm too of the populace was not even slightly kindled, 
<A NAME="420"></A>for the pantomimic actors, though permitted to return to the stage, were 
<A NAME="421"></A>excluded from the sacred contests. No one gained the first prize for eloquence, 
<A NAME="422"></A>but it was publicly announced that the emperor was victorious. Greek dresses, 
<A NAME="423"></A>in which most people showed themselves during this festival, had then gone 
<A NAME="424"></A>out of fashion.
<A NAME="425"></A><BR><BR>A comet meantime blazed in the sky, which in popular opinion always 
<A NAME="426"></A>portends revolution to kingdoms. So people began to ask, as if Nero was 
<A NAME="427"></A>already dethroned, who was to be elected. In every one's mouth was the 
<A NAME="428"></A>name of Rubellius Blandus, who inherited through his mother the high nobility 
<A NAME="429"></A>of the Julian family. He was himself attached to the ideas of our ancestors; 
<A NAME="430"></A>his manners were austere, his home was one of purity and seclusion, and 
<A NAME="431"></A>the more he lived in retirement from fear, the more fame did he acquire. 
<A NAME="432"></A>Popular talk was confirmed by an interpretation put with similar credulity 
<A NAME="433"></A>on a flash of lightning. While Nero was reclining at dinner in his house 
<A NAME="434"></A>named Sublaqueum on the Simbruine lake, the table with the banquet was 
<A NAME="435"></A>struck and shattered, and as this happened close to Tibur, from which town 
<A NAME="436"></A>Plautus derived his origin on his father's side, people believed him to 
<A NAME="437"></A>be the man marked out by divine providence; and he was encouraged by that 
<A NAME="438"></A>numerous class, whose eager and often mistaken ambition it is to attach 
<A NAME="439"></A>themselves prematurely to some new and hazardous cause. This alarmed Nero, 
<A NAME="440"></A>and he wrote a letter to Plautus, bidding "him consider the tranquillity 
<A NAME="441"></A>of Rome and withdraw himself from mischievous gossip. He had ancestral 
<A NAME="442"></A>possessions in Asia, where he might enjoy his youth safely and quietly." 
<A NAME="443"></A>And so thither Plautus retired with his wife Antistia and a few intimate 
<A NAME="444"></A>friends.
<A NAME="445"></A><BR><BR>About the same time an excessive love of luxurious gratification 
<A NAME="446"></A>involved Nero in disgrace and danger. He had plunged for a swim into the 
<A NAME="447"></A>source of the stream which Quintus Marcius conveyed to Rome, and it was 
<A NAME="448"></A>thought that, by thus immersing his person in it, he had polluted the sacred 
<A NAME="449"></A>waters and the sanctity of the spot. A fit of illness which followed, convinced 
<A NAME="450"></A>people of the divine displeasure.
<A NAME="451"></A><BR><BR>Corbulo meanwhile having demolished Artaxata thought that he ought 
<A NAME="452"></A>to avail himself of the recent panic by possessing himself of Tigranocerta, 
<A NAME="453"></A>and either, by destroying it, increase the enemy's terror, or, by sparing 
<A NAME="454"></A>it, win a name for mercy. Thither he marched his army, with no hostile 
<A NAME="455"></A>demonstrations, lest might cut off all hope of quarter, but still without 
<A NAME="456"></A>relaxing his vigilance, knowing, as he did, the fickle temper of the people, 
<A NAME="457"></A>who are as treacherous, when they have an opportunity, as they are slow 
<A NAME="458"></A>to meet danger. The barbarians, following their individual inclinations, 
<A NAME="459"></A>either came to him with entreaties, or quitted their villages and dispersed 
<A NAME="460"></A>into their deserts. Some there were who hid themselves in caverns with 
<A NAME="461"></A>all that they held dearest. The Roman general accordingly dealt variously 
<A NAME="462"></A>with them; he was merciful to suppliants, swift in pursuit of fugitives, 
<A NAME="463"></A>pitiless towards those who had crept into hiding-places, burning them out 
<A NAME="464"></A>after filling up the entrances and exits with brushwood and bushes. As 
<A NAME="465"></A>he was on his march along the frontier of the Mardi, he was incessantly 
<A NAME="466"></A>attacked by that tribe which is trained to guerilla warfare, and defended 
<A NAME="467"></A>by mountains against an invader. Corbulo threw the Iberians on them, ravaged 
<A NAME="468"></A>their country and punished the enemy's daring at the cost of the blood 
<A NAME="469"></A>of the foreigner.
<A NAME="470"></A><BR><BR>Both Corbulo and his army, though suffering no losses in battle, 
<A NAME="471"></A>were becoming exhausted by short supplies and hardships, compelled as they 
<A NAME="472"></A>were to stave off hunger solely by the flesh of cattle. Added to this was 
<A NAME="473"></A>scarcity of water, a burning summer and long marches, all of which were 
<A NAME="474"></A>alleviated only by the general's patient endurance. He bore indeed the 
<A NAME="475"></A>same or even more burdens than the common soldier. Subsequently, they reached 
<A NAME="476"></A>lands under cultivation, and reaped the crops, and of two fortresses in 
<A NAME="477"></A>which the Armenians had fled for refuge, one was taken by storm; the other, 
<A NAME="478"></A>which repulsed the first attack, was reduced by blockade. Thence the general 
<A NAME="479"></A>crossed into the country of the Tauraunites, where he escaped an unforeseen 
<A NAME="480"></A>peril. Near his tent, a barbarian of no mean rank was discovered with a 
<A NAME="481"></A>dagger, who divulged under torture the whole method of the plot, its contrivance 
<A NAME="482"></A>by himself, and his associates. The men who under a show of friendship 
<A NAME="483"></A>planned the treachery, were convicted and punished.
<A NAME="484"></A><BR><BR>Soon afterwards, Corbulo's envoys whom he had sent to Tigranocerta, 
<A NAME="485"></A>reported that the city walls were open, and the inhabitants awaiting orders. 
<A NAME="486"></A>They also handed him a gift denoting friendship, a golden crown, which 
<A NAME="487"></A>he acknowledged in complimentary language. Nothing was done to humiliate 
<A NAME="488"></A>the city, that remaining uninjured it might continue to yield a more cheerful 
<A NAME="489"></A>obedience.
<A NAME="490"></A><BR><BR>The citadel, however, which had been closed by an intrepid band 
<A NAME="491"></A>of youths, was not stormed without a struggle. They even ventured on an 
<A NAME="492"></A>engagement under the walls, but were driven back within their fortifications 
<A NAME="493"></A>and succumbed at last only to our siege-works and to the swords of furious 
<A NAME="494"></A>assailants. The success was the easier, as the Parthians were distracted 
<A NAME="495"></A>by a war with the Hyrcanians, who had sent to the Roman emperor, imploring 
<A NAME="496"></A>alliance, and pointing to the fact that they were detaining Vologeses as 
<A NAME="497"></A>a pledge of amity. When these envoys were on their way home, Corbulo, to 
<A NAME="498"></A>save them from being intercepted by the enemy's picquets after their passage 
<A NAME="499"></A>of the Euphrates, gave them an escort, and conducted them to the shores 
<A NAME="500"></A>of the Red Sea, whence, avoiding Parthian territory, they returned to their 
<A NAME="501"></A>native possessions.
<A NAME="502"></A><BR><BR>Corbulo too, as Tiridates was entering the Armenian frontier through 
<A NAME="503"></A>Media, sent on Verulanus, his lieutenant-general with the auxiliaries, 
<A NAME="504"></A>while he himself followed with the legions by forced marches, and compelled 
<A NAME="505"></A>him to retreat to a distance and abandon the idea of war. Having harried 
<A NAME="506"></A>with fire and sword all whom he had ascertained to be against us, he began 
<A NAME="507"></A>to take possession of Armenia, when Tigranes arrived, whom Nero had selected 
<A NAME="508"></A>to assume the sovereignty. Though a Cappadocian noble and grandson of king 
<A NAME="509"></A>Archelaus, yet, from having long been a hostage at Rome, he had sunk into 
<A NAME="510"></A>servile submissiveness. Nor was he unanimously welcomed, as some still 
<A NAME="511"></A>cherished a liking for the Arsacids. Most, however, in their hatred of 
<A NAME="512"></A>Parthian arrogance preferred a king given them by Rome. He was supported 
<A NAME="513"></A>too with a force of a thousand legionaries, three allied cohorts and two 
<A NAME="514"></A>squadrons of cavalry, that he might the more easily secure his new kingdom. 
<A NAME="515"></A>Parts of Armenia, according to their respective proximities, were put under 
<A NAME="516"></A>the subjection of Pharasmanes, Polemo, Aristobulus, and Antiochus. Corbulo 
<A NAME="517"></A>retired into Syria, which province, as being vacant by the death of its 
<A NAME="518"></A>governor Ummidius, was intrusted to him.
<A NAME="519"></A><BR><BR>One of the famous cities of Asia, Laodicea, was that same year 
<A NAME="520"></A>overthrown by an earthquake, and, without any relief from us, recovered 
<A NAME="521"></A>itself by its own resources. In Italy meanwhile the old town of Puteoli 
<A NAME="522"></A>obtained from Nero the privileges of a colony with an additional name. 
<A NAME="523"></A>A further enrolment of veterans in Tarentum and Antium did but little for 
<A NAME="524"></A>those thinly peopled places; for most scattered themselves in the provinces 
<A NAME="525"></A>where they had completed their military service. Not being accustomed to 
<A NAME="526"></A>tie themselves by marriage and rear children, they left behind them homes 
<A NAME="527"></A>without families. For whole legions were no longer transplanted, as in 
<A NAME="528"></A>former days, with tribunes and centurions and soldiers of every grade, 
<A NAME="529"></A>so as to form a state by their unity and mutual attachment, but strangers 
<A NAME="530"></A>to one another from different companies, without a head or any community 
<A NAME="531"></A>of sentiment, were suddenly gathered together, as it might be out of any 
<A NAME="532"></A>other class of human beings, and became a mere crowd rather than a 
<A NAME="533"></A>colony.
<A NAME="534"></A><BR><BR>As at the elections for praetors, now generally under the Senate's 
<A NAME="535"></A>control there was the excitement of a particularly keen competition, the 
<A NAME="536"></A>emperor quieted matters by promoting the three supernumerary candidates 
<A NAME="537"></A>to legionary commands. He also raised the dignity of the Senate, by deciding 
<A NAME="538"></A>that all who appealed from private judges to its house, were to incur the 
<A NAME="539"></A>same pecuniary risk as those who referred their cause to the emperor. Hitherto 
<A NAME="540"></A>such an appeal had been perfectly open, and free from 
<A NAME="541"></A>penalty.
<A NAME="542"></A><BR><BR>At the close of the year Vibius Secundus, a Roman knight, on the 
<A NAME="543"></A>accusation of the Moors, was convicted of extortion, and banished from 
<A NAME="544"></A>Italy, contriving through the influence of his brother Vibius Crispus to 
<A NAME="545"></A>escape heavier punishment.
<A NAME="546"></A><BR><BR>In the consulship of Caesonius Paetus and Petronius Turpilianus, 
<A NAME="547"></A>a serious disaster was sustained in Britain, where Aulius Didius, the emperor's 
<A NAME="548"></A>legate, had merely retained our existing possessions, and his successor 
<A NAME="549"></A>Veranius, after having ravaged the Silures in some trifling raids, was 
<A NAME="550"></A>prevented by death from extending the war. While he lived, he had a great 
<A NAME="551"></A>name for manly independence, though, in his will's final words, he betrayed 
<A NAME="552"></A>a flatterer's weakness; for, after heaping adulation on Nero, he added 
<A NAME="553"></A>that he should have conquered the province for him, had he lived for the 
<A NAME="554"></A>next two years. Now, however, Britain was in the hands of Suetonius Paulinus, 
<A NAME="555"></A>who in military knowledge and in popular favour, which allows no one to 
<A NAME="556"></A>be without a rival, vied with Corbulo, and aspired to equal the glory of 
<A NAME="557"></A>the recovery of Armenia by the subjugation of Rome's enemies. He therefore 
<A NAME="558"></A>prepared to attack the island of Mona which had a powerful population and 
<A NAME="559"></A>was a refuge for fugitives. He built flat-bottomed vessels to cope with 
<A NAME="560"></A>the shallows, and uncertain depths of the sea. Thus the infantry crossed, 
<A NAME="561"></A>while the cavalry followed by fording, or, where the water was deep, swam 
<A NAME="562"></A>by the side of their horses.
<A NAME="563"></A><BR><BR>On the shore stood the opposing army with its dense array of armed 
<A NAME="564"></A>warriors, while between the ranks dashed women, in black attire like the 
<A NAME="565"></A>Furies, with hair dishevelled, waving brands. All around, the Druids, lifting 
<A NAME="566"></A>up their hands to heaven, and pouring forth dreadful imprecations, scared 
<A NAME="567"></A>our soldiers by the unfamiliar sight, so that, as if their limbs were paralysed, 
<A NAME="568"></A>they stood motionless, and exposed to wounds. Then urged by their general's 
<A NAME="569"></A>appeals and mutual encouragements not to quail before a troop of frenzied 
<A NAME="570"></A>women, they bore the standards onwards, smote down all resistance, and 
<A NAME="571"></A>wrapped the foe in the flames of his own brands. A force was next set over 
<A NAME="572"></A>the conquered, and their groves, devoted to inhuman superstitions, were 
<A NAME="573"></A>destroyed. They deemed it indeed a duty to cover their altars with the 
<A NAME="574"></A>blood of captives and to consult their deities through human 
<A NAME="575"></A>entrails.
<A NAME="576"></A><BR><BR>Suetonius while thus occupied received tidings of the sudden revolt 
<A NAME="577"></A>of the province. Prasutagus, king of the Iceni, famed for his long prosperity, 
<A NAME="578"></A>had made the emperor his heir along with his two daughters, under the impression 
<A NAME="579"></A>that this token of submission would put his kingdom and his house out of 
<A NAME="580"></A>the reach of wrong. But the reverse was the result, so much so that his 
<A NAME="581"></A>kingdom was plundered by centurions, his house by slaves, as if they were 
<A NAME="582"></A>the spoils of war. First, his wife Boudicea was scourged, and his daughters 
<A NAME="583"></A>outraged. All the chief men of the Iceni, as if Rome had received the whole 
<A NAME="584"></A>country as a gift, were stript of their ancestral possessions, and the 
<A NAME="585"></A>king's relatives were made slaves. Roused by these insults and the dread 
<A NAME="586"></A>of worse, reduced as they now were into the condition of a province, they 
<A NAME="587"></A>flew to arms and stirred to revolt the Trinobantes and others who, not 
<A NAME="588"></A>yet cowed by slavery, had agreed in secret conspiracy to reclaim their 
<A NAME="589"></A>freedom. It was against the veterans that their hatred was most intense. 
<A NAME="590"></A>For these new settlers in the colony of Camulodunum drove people out of 
<A NAME="591"></A>their houses, ejected them from their farms, called them captives and slaves, 
<A NAME="592"></A>and the lawlessness of the veterans was encouraged by the soldiers, who 
<A NAME="593"></A>lived a similar life and hoped for similar licence. A temple also erected 
<A NAME="594"></A>to the Divine Claudius was ever before their eyes, a citadel, as it seemed, 
<A NAME="595"></A>of perpetual tyranny. Men chosen as priests had to squander their whole 
<A NAME="596"></A>fortunes under the pretence of a religious ceremonial. It appeared too 
<A NAME="597"></A>no difficult matter to destroy the colony, undefended as it was by fortifications, 
<A NAME="598"></A>a precaution neglected by our generals, while they thought more of what 
<A NAME="599"></A>was agreeable than of what was expedient.
<A NAME="600"></A><BR><BR>Meanwhile, without any evident cause, the statue of Victory at 
<A NAME="601"></A>Camulodunum fell prostrate and turned its back to the enemy, as though 
<A NAME="602"></A>it fled before them. Women excited to frenzy prophesied impending destruction; 
<A NAME="603"></A>ravings in a strange tongue, it was said, were heard in their Senate-house; 
<A NAME="604"></A>their theatre resounded with wailings, and in the estuary of the Tamesa 
<A NAME="605"></A>had been seen the appearance of an overthrown town; even the ocean had 
<A NAME="606"></A>worn the aspect of blood, and, when the tide ebbed, there had been left 
<A NAME="607"></A>the likenesses of human forms, marvels interpreted by the Britons, as hopeful, 
<A NAME="608"></A>by the veterans, as alarming. But as Suetonius was far away, they implored 
<A NAME="609"></A>aid from the procurator, Catus Decianus. All he did was to send two hundred 
<A NAME="610"></A>men, and no more, without regular arms, and there was in the place but 
<A NAME="611"></A>a small military force. Trusting to the protection of the temple, hindered 
<A NAME="612"></A>too by secret accomplices in the revolt, who embarrassed their plans, they 
<A NAME="613"></A>had constructed neither fosse nor rampart; nor had they removed their old 
<A NAME="614"></A>men and women, leaving their youth alone to face the foe. Surprised, as 
<A NAME="615"></A>it were, in the midst of peace, they were surrounded by an immense host 
<A NAME="616"></A>of the barbarians. All else was plundered or fired in the onslaught; the 
<A NAME="617"></A>temple where the soldiers had assembled, was stormed after a two days' 
<A NAME="618"></A>siege. The victorious enemy met Petilius Cerialis, commander of the ninth 
<A NAME="619"></A>legion, as he was coming to the rescue, routed his troops, and destroyed 
<A NAME="620"></A>all his infantry. Cerialis escaped with some cavalry into the camp, and 
<A NAME="621"></A>was saved by its fortifications. Alarmed by this disaster and by the fury 
<A NAME="622"></A>of the province which he had goaded into war by his rapacity, the procurator 
<A NAME="623"></A>Catus crossed over into Gaul.
<A NAME="624"></A><BR><BR>Suetonius, however, with wonderful resolution, marched amidst a 
<A NAME="625"></A>hostile population to Londinium, which, though undistinguished by the name 
<A NAME="626"></A>of a colony, was much frequented by a number of merchants and trading vessels. 
<A NAME="627"></A>Uncertain whether he should choose it as a seat of war, as he looked round 
<A NAME="628"></A>on his scanty force of soldiers, and remembered with what a serious warning 
<A NAME="629"></A>the rashness of Petilius had been punished, he resolved to save the province 
<A NAME="630"></A>at the cost of a single town. Nor did the tears and weeping of the people, 
<A NAME="631"></A>as they implored his aid, deter him from giving the signal of departure 
<A NAME="632"></A>and receiving into his army all who would go with him. Those who were chained 
<A NAME="633"></A>to the spot by the weakness of their sex, or the infirmity of age, or the 
<A NAME="634"></A>attractions of the place, were cut off by the enemy. Like ruin fell on 
<A NAME="635"></A>the town of Verulamium, for the barbarians, who delighted in plunder and 
<A NAME="636"></A>were indifferent to all else, passed by the fortresses with military garrisons, 
<A NAME="637"></A>and attacked whatever offered most wealth to the spoiler, and was unsafe 
<A NAME="638"></A>for defence. About seventy thousand citizens and allies, it appeared, fell 
<A NAME="639"></A>in the places which I have mentioned. For it was not on making prisoners 
<A NAME="640"></A>and selling them, or on any of the barter of war, that the enemy was bent, 
<A NAME="641"></A>but on slaughter, on the gibbet, the fire and the cross, like men soon 
<A NAME="642"></A>about to pay the penalty, and meanwhile snatching at instant 
<A NAME="643"></A>vengeance.
<A NAME="644"></A><BR><BR>Suetonius had the fourteenth legion with the veterans of the twentieth, 
<A NAME="645"></A>and auxiliaries from the neighbourhood, to the number of about ten thousand 
<A NAME="646"></A>armed men, when he prepared to break off delay and fight a battle. He chose 
<A NAME="647"></A>a position approached by a narrow defile, closed in at the rear by a forest, 
<A NAME="648"></A>having first ascertained that there was not a soldier of the enemy except 
<A NAME="649"></A>in his front, where an open plain extended without any danger from ambuscades. 
<A NAME="650"></A>His legions were in close array; round them, the light-armed troops, and 
<A NAME="651"></A>the cavalry in dense array on the wings. On the other side, the army of 
<A NAME="652"></A>the Britons, with its masses of infantry and cavalry, was confidently exulting, 
<A NAME="653"></A>a vaster host than ever had assembled, and so fierce in spirit that they 
<A NAME="654"></A>actually brought with them, to witness the victory, their wives riding 
<A NAME="655"></A>in waggons, which they had placed on the extreme border of the 
<A NAME="656"></A>plain.
<A NAME="657"></A><BR><BR>Boudicea, with her daughters before her in a chariot, went up to 
<A NAME="658"></A>tribe after tribe, protesting that it was indeed usual for Britons to fight 
<A NAME="659"></A>under the leadership of women. "But now," she said, "it is not as a woman 
<A NAME="660"></A>descended from noble ancestry, but as one of the people that I am avenging 
<A NAME="661"></A>lost freedom, my scourged body, the outraged chastity of my daughters. 
<A NAME="662"></A>Roman lust has gone so far that not our very persons, nor even age or virginity, 
<A NAME="663"></A>are left unpolluted. But heaven is on the side of a righteous vengeance; 
<A NAME="664"></A>a legion which dared to fight has perished; the rest are hiding themselves 
<A NAME="665"></A>in their camp, or are thinking anxiously of flight. They will not sustain 
<A NAME="666"></A>even the din and the shout of so many thousands, much less our charge and 
<A NAME="667"></A>our blows. If you weigh well the strength of the armies, and the causes 
<A NAME="668"></A>of the war, you will see that in this battle you must conquer or die. This 
<A NAME="669"></A>is a woman's resolve; as for men, they may live and be 
<A NAME="670"></A>slaves."
<A NAME="671"></A><BR><BR>Nor was Suetonius silent at such a crisis. Though he confided in 
<A NAME="672"></A>the valour of his men, he yet mingled encouragements and entreaties to 
<A NAME="673"></A>disdain the clamours and empty threats of the barbarians. "There," he said, 
<A NAME="674"></A>"you see more women than warriors. Unwarlike, unarmed, they will give way 
<A NAME="675"></A>the moment they have recognised that sword and that courage of their conquerors, 
<A NAME="676"></A>which have so often routed them. Even among many legions, it is a few who 
<A NAME="677"></A>really decide the battle, and it will enhance their glory that a small 
<A NAME="678"></A>force should earn the renown of an entire army. Only close up the ranks, 
<A NAME="679"></A>and having discharged your javelins, then with shields and swords continue 
<A NAME="680"></A>the work of bloodshed and destruction, without a thought of plunder. When 
<A NAME="681"></A>once the victory has been won, everything will be in your 
<A NAME="682"></A>power."
<A NAME="683"></A><BR><BR>Such was the enthusiasm which followed the general's address, and 
<A NAME="684"></A>so promptly did the veteran soldiery, with their long experience of battles, 
<A NAME="685"></A>prepare for the hurling of the javelins, that it was with confidence in 
<A NAME="686"></A>the result that Suetonius gave the signal of battle.
<A NAME="687"></A><BR><BR>At first, the legion kept its position, clinging to the narrow 
<A NAME="688"></A>defile as a defence; when they had exhausted their missiles, which they 
<A NAME="689"></A>discharged with unerring aim on the closely approaching foe, they rushed 
<A NAME="690"></A>out in a wedge-like column. Similar was the onset of the auxiliaries, while 
<A NAME="691"></A>the cavalry with extended lances broke through all who offered a strong 
<A NAME="692"></A>resistance. The rest turned their back in flight, and flight proved difficult, 
<A NAME="693"></A>because the surrounding waggons had blocked retreat. Our soldiers spared 
<A NAME="694"></A>not to slay even the women, while the very beasts of burden, transfixed 
<A NAME="695"></A>by the missiles, swelled the piles of bodies. Great glory, equal to that 
<A NAME="696"></A>of our old victories, was won on that day. Some indeed say that there fell 
<A NAME="697"></A>little less than eighty thousand of the Britons, with a loss to our soldiers 
<A NAME="698"></A>of about four hundred, and only as many wounded. Boudicea put an end to 
<A NAME="699"></A>her life by poison. Poenius Postumus too, camp-prefect of the second legion, 
<A NAME="700"></A>when he knew of the success of the men of the fourteenth and twentieth, 
<A NAME="701"></A>feeling that he had cheated his legion out of like glory, and had contrary 
<A NAME="702"></A>to all military usage disregarded the general's orders, threw himself on 
<A NAME="703"></A>his sword.
<A NAME="704"></A><BR><BR>The whole army was then brought together and kept under canvas 
<A NAME="705"></A>to finish the remainder of the war. The emperor strengthened the forces 
<A NAME="706"></A>by sending from Germany two thousand legionaries, eight cohorts of auxiliaries, 
<A NAME="707"></A>and a thousand cavalry. On their arrival the men of the ninth had their 
<A NAME="708"></A>number made up with legionary soldiers. The allied infantry and cavalry 
<A NAME="709"></A>were placed in new winter quarters, and whatever tribes still wavered or 
<A NAME="710"></A>were hostile were ravaged with fire and sword. Nothing however distressed 
<A NAME="711"></A>the enemy so much as famine, for they had been careless about sowing corn, 
<A NAME="712"></A>people of every age having gone to the war, while they reckoned on our 
<A NAME="713"></A>supplies as their own. Nations, too, so high-spirited inclined the more 
<A NAME="714"></A>slowly to peace, because Julius Classicanus, who had been sent as successor 
<A NAME="715"></A>to Catus and was at variance with Suetonius, let private animosities interfere 
<A NAME="716"></A>with the public interest, and had spread an idea that they ought to wait 
<A NAME="717"></A>for a new governor who, having neither the anger of an enemy nor the pride 
<A NAME="718"></A>of a conqueror, would deal mercifully with those who had surrendered. At 
<A NAME="719"></A>the same time he stated in a despatch to Rome that no cessation of fighting 
<A NAME="720"></A>must be expected, unless Suetonius were superseded, attributing that general's 
<A NAME="721"></A>disasters to perverseness and his successes to good 
<A NAME="722"></A>luck.
<A NAME="723"></A><BR><BR>Accordingly one of the imperial freedmen, Polyclitus, was sent 
<A NAME="724"></A>to survey the state of Britain, Nero having great hopes that his influence 
<A NAME="725"></A>would be able not only to establish a good understanding between the governor 
<A NAME="726"></A>and the pro-curator, but also to pacify the rebellious spirit of the barbarians. 
<A NAME="727"></A>And Polyclitus, who with his enormous suite had been a burden to Italy 
<A NAME="728"></A>and Gaul, failed not, as soon as he had crossed the ocean, to make his 
<A NAME="729"></A>progresses a terror even to our soldiers. But to the enemy he was a laughing-stock, 
<A NAME="730"></A>for they still retained some of the fire of liberty, knowing nothing yet 
<A NAME="731"></A>of the power of freedmen, and so they marvelled to see a general and an 
<A NAME="732"></A>army who had finished such a war cringing to slaves. Everything, however, 
<A NAME="733"></A>was softened down for the emperor's ears, and Suetonius was retained in 
<A NAME="734"></A>the government; but as he subsequently lost a few vessels on the shore 
<A NAME="735"></A>with the crews, he was ordered, as though the war continued, to hand over 
<A NAME="736"></A>his army to Petronius Turpilianus, who had just resigned his consulship. 
<A NAME="737"></A>Petronius neither challenged the enemy nor was himself molested, and veiled 
<A NAME="738"></A>this tame inaction under the honourable name of peace.
<A NAME="739"></A><BR><BR>That same year two remarkable crimes were committed at Rome, one 
<A NAME="740"></A>by a senator, the other by the daring of a slave. Domitius Balbus, an ex-praetor, 
<A NAME="741"></A>from his prolonged old age, his childlessness and his wealth, was exposed 
<A NAME="742"></A>to many a plot. His kinsman, Valerius Fabianus, who was marked out for 
<A NAME="743"></A>a career of promotion, forged a will in his name with Vinicius Rufinus 
<A NAME="744"></A>and Terentius Lentinus, Roman knights, for his accomplices. These men had 
<A NAME="745"></A>associated with them Antonius Primus and Asinius Marcellus. Antonius was 
<A NAME="746"></A>a man of ready audacity; Marcellus had the glory of being the great-grandson 
<A NAME="747"></A>of Asinius Pollio, and bore a character far from contemptible, except that 
<A NAME="748"></A>he thought poverty the greatest of all evils. So Fabianus, with the persons 
<A NAME="749"></A>whom I have named and some others less distinguished, executed the will. 
<A NAME="750"></A>The crime was proved against them before the Senate, and Fabianus and Antonius 
<A NAME="751"></A>with Rufinus and Terentius were condemned under the Cornelian law. Marcellus 
<A NAME="752"></A>was saved from punishment rather than from disgrace by the memory of his 
<A NAME="753"></A>ancestors and the intercessions of the emperor.
<A NAME="754"></A><BR><BR>That same day was fatal also to Pompeius Aelianus, a young ex-quaestor, 
<A NAME="755"></A>suspected of complicity in the villanies of Fabianus. He was outlawed from 
<A NAME="756"></A>Italy, and from Spain, where he was born. Valerius Pontius suffered the 
<A NAME="757"></A>same degradation for having indicted the defendants before the praetor 
<A NAME="758"></A>to save them from being prosecuted in the court of the city-prefect, purposing 
<A NAME="759"></A>meanwhile to defeat justice on some legal pretext and subsequently by collusion. 
<A NAME="760"></A>A clause was added to the Senate's decree, that whoever bought or sold 
<A NAME="761"></A>such a service was to be just as liable to punishment as if he had been 
<A NAME="762"></A>publicly convicted of false accusation.
<A NAME="763"></A><BR><BR>Soon afterwards one of his own slaves murdered the city-prefect, 
<A NAME="764"></A>Pedanius Secundus, either because he had been refused his freedom, for 
<A NAME="765"></A>which he had made a bargain, or in the jealousy of a love in which he could 
<A NAME="766"></A>not brook his master's rivalry. Ancient custom required that the whole 
<A NAME="767"></A>slave-establishment which had dwelt under the same roof should be dragged 
<A NAME="768"></A>to execution, when a sudden gathering of the populace, which was for saving 
<A NAME="769"></A>so many innocent lives, brought matters to actual insurrection. Even in 
<A NAME="770"></A>the Senate there was a strong feeling on the part of those who shrank from 
<A NAME="771"></A>extreme rigour, though the majority were opposed to any innovation. Of 
<A NAME="772"></A>these, Caius Cassius, in giving his vote, argued to the following 
<A NAME="773"></A>effect:-
<A NAME="774"></A><BR><BR>"Often have I been present, Senators, in this assembly when new 
<A NAME="775"></A>decrees were demanded from us contrary to the customs and laws of our ancestors, 
<A NAME="776"></A>and I have refrained from opposition, not because I doubted but that in 
<A NAME="777"></A>all matters the arrangements of the past were better and fairer and that 
<A NAME="778"></A>all changes were for the worse, but that I might not seem to be exalting 
<A NAME="779"></A>my own profession out of an excessive partiality for ancient precedent. 
<A NAME="780"></A>At the same time I thought that any influence I possess ought not to be 
<A NAME="781"></A>destroyed by incessant protests, wishing that it might remain unimpaired, 
<A NAME="782"></A>should the State ever need my counsels. To-day this has come to pass, since 
<A NAME="783"></A>an ex-consul has been murdered in his house by the treachery of slaves, 
<A NAME="784"></A>which not one hindered or divulged, though the Senate's decree, which threatens 
<A NAME="785"></A>the entire slave-establishment with execution, has been till now unshaken. 
<A NAME="786"></A>Vote impunity, in heaven's name, and then who will be protected by his 
<A NAME="787"></A>rank, when the prefecture of the capital has been of no avail to its holder? 
<A NAME="788"></A>Who will be kept safe by the number of his slaves when four hundred have 
<A NAME="789"></A>not protected Pedanius Secundus? Which of us will be rescued by his domestics, 
<A NAME="790"></A>who, even with the dread of punishment before them, regard not our dangers? 
<A NAME="791"></A>Was the murderer, as some do not blush to pretend, avenging his wrongs 
<A NAME="792"></A>because he had bargained about money from his father or because a family-slave 
<A NAME="793"></A>was taken from him? Let us actually decide that the master was justly 
<A NAME="794"></A>slain.
<A NAME="795"></A><BR><BR>"Is it your pleasure to search for arguments in a matter already 
<A NAME="796"></A>weighed in the deliberations of wiser men than ourselves? Even if we had 
<A NAME="797"></A>now for the first time to come to a decision, do you believe that a slave 
<A NAME="798"></A>took courage to murder his master without letting fall a threatening word 
<A NAME="799"></A>or uttering a rash syllable? Granted that he concealed his purpose, that 
<A NAME="800"></A>he procured his weapon without his fellows' knowledge. Could he pass the 
<A NAME="801"></A>night-guard, could he open the doors of the chamber, carry in a light, 
<A NAME="802"></A>and accomplish the murder, while all were in ignorance? There are many 
<A NAME="803"></A>preliminaries to guilt; if these are divulged by slaves, we may live singly 
<A NAME="804"></A>amid numbers, safe among a trembling throng; lastly, if we must perish, 
<A NAME="805"></A>it will be with vengeance on the guilty. Our ancestors always suspected 
<A NAME="806"></A>the temper of their slaves, even when they were born on the same estates, 
<A NAME="807"></A>or in the same houses with themselves and thus inherited from their birth 
<A NAME="808"></A>an affection for their masters. But now that we have in our households 
<A NAME="809"></A>nations with different customs to our own, with a foreign worship or none 
<A NAME="810"></A>at all, it is only by terror you can hold in such a motley rabble. But, 
<A NAME="811"></A>it will be said, the innocent will perish. Well, even in a beaten army 
<A NAME="812"></A>when every tenth man is felled by the club, the lot falls also on the brave. 
<A NAME="813"></A>There is some injustice in every great precedent, which, though injurious 
<A NAME="814"></A>to individuals, has its compensation in the public advantage."
<A NAME="815"></A><BR><BR>No one indeed dared singly to oppose the opinion of Cassius, but 
<A NAME="816"></A>clamorous voices rose in reply from all who pitied the number, age, or 
<A NAME="817"></A>sex, as well as the undoubted innocence of the great majority. Still, the 
<A NAME="818"></A>party which voted for their execution prevailed. But the sentence could 
<A NAME="819"></A>not be obeyed in the face of a dense and threatening mob, with stones and 
<A NAME="820"></A>firebrands. Then the emperor reprimanded the people by edict, and lined 
<A NAME="821"></A>with a force of soldiers the entire route by which the condemned had to 
<A NAME="822"></A>be dragged to execution. Cingonius Varro had proposed that even all the 
<A NAME="823"></A>freedmen under the same roof should be transported from Italy. This the 
<A NAME="824"></A>emperor forbade, as he did not wish an ancient custom, which mercy had 
<A NAME="825"></A>not relaxed, to be strained with cruel rigour.
<A NAME="826"></A><BR><BR>During the same consulship, Tarquitius Priscus was convicted of 
<A NAME="827"></A>extortion on the prosecution of the Bithynians, to the great joy of the 
<A NAME="828"></A>senators, who remembered that he had impeached Statilius, his own pro-consul. 
<A NAME="829"></A>An assessment was made of Gaul by Quintus Volusius, Sextius Africanus, 
<A NAME="830"></A>and Trebellius Maximus. There was a rivalry, on the score of rank, between 
<A NAME="831"></A>Volusius and Africanus. While they both disdained Trebellius, they raised 
<A NAME="832"></A>him above themselves.
<A NAME="833"></A><BR><BR>In that year died Memmius Regulus, who from his solid worth and 
<A NAME="834"></A>consistency was as distinguished as it is possible to be under the shadow 
<A NAME="835"></A>of an emperor's grandeur, so much so, in fact, that Nero when he was ill, 
<A NAME="836"></A>with flatterers round him, who said that if aught befell him in the course 
<A NAME="837"></A>of destiny, there must be an end of the empire, replied that the State 
<A NAME="838"></A>had a resource, and on their asking where it was specially to be found, 
<A NAME="839"></A>he added, "in Memmius Regulus." Yet Regulus lived after this, protected 
<A NAME="840"></A>by his retiring habits, and by the fact that he was a man of newly-risen 
<A NAME="841"></A>family and of wealth which did not provoke envy. Nero, the same year, established 
<A NAME="842"></A>a gymnasium, where oil was furnished to knights and senators after the 
<A NAME="843"></A>lax fashion of the Greeks.
<A NAME="844"></A><BR><BR>In the consulship of Publius Marius and Lucius Asinius, Antistius, 
<A NAME="845"></A>the praetor, whose lawless behaviour as tribune of the people I have mentioned, 
<A NAME="846"></A>composed some libellous verses on the emperor, which he openly recited 
<A NAME="847"></A>at a large gathering, when he was dining at the house of Ostorius Scapula. 
<A NAME="848"></A>He was upon this impeached of high treason by Cossutianus Capito, who had 
<A NAME="849"></A>lately been restored to a senator's rank on the intercession of his father-in-law, 
<A NAME="850"></A>Tigellinus. This was the first occasion on which the law of treason was 
<A NAME="851"></A>revived, and men thought that it was not so much the ruin of Antistius 
<A NAME="852"></A>which was aimed at, as the glory of the emperor, whose veto as tribune 
<A NAME="853"></A>might save from death one whom the Senate had condemned. Though Ostorius 
<A NAME="854"></A>had stated that he had heard nothing as evidence, the adverse witnesses 
<A NAME="855"></A>were believed, and Junius Marullus, consul-elect, proposed that the accused 
<A NAME="856"></A>should be deprived of his praetorship, and be put to death in the ancient 
<A NAME="857"></A>manner. The rest assented, and then Paetus Thrasea, after much eulogy of 
<A NAME="858"></A>Caesar, and most bitter censure of Antistius, argued that it was not what 
<A NAME="859"></A>a guilty prisoner might deserve to suffer, which ought to be decreed against 
<A NAME="860"></A>him, under so excellent a prince, and by a Senate bound by no compulsion. 
<A NAME="861"></A>"The executioner and the halter," he said, "we have long ago abolished; 
<A NAME="862"></A>still, there are punishments ordained by the laws, which prescribe penalties, 
<A NAME="863"></A>without judicial cruelty and disgrace to our age. Rather send him to some 
<A NAME="864"></A>island, after confiscating his property; there, the longer he drags on 
<A NAME="865"></A>his guilty life, the more wretched will he be personally, and the more 
<A NAME="866"></A>conspicuous as an example of public clemency."
<A NAME="867"></A><BR><BR>Thrasea's freespokenness broke through the servility of the other 
<A NAME="868"></A>senators. As soon as the consul allowed a division, they voted with him, 
<A NAME="869"></A>with but few exceptions. Among these, the most enthusiastic in his flattery 
<A NAME="870"></A>was Aulus Vitellius, who attacked all the best men with abuse, and was 
<A NAME="871"></A>silent when they replied, the usual way of a cowardly temper. The consuls, 
<A NAME="872"></A>however, did not dare to ratify the Senate's vote, and simply communicated 
<A NAME="873"></A>their unanimous resolution to the emperor. Hesitating for a while between 
<A NAME="874"></A>shame and rage, he at last wrote to them in reply "that Antistius, without 
<A NAME="875"></A>having been provoked by any wrong, had uttered outrageous insults against 
<A NAME="876"></A>the sovereign; that a demand for punishment had been submitted to the Senate, 
<A NAME="877"></A>and that it was right that a penalty should be decreed proportioned to 
<A NAME="878"></A>the offence; that for himself, inasmuch as he would have opposed severity 
<A NAME="879"></A>in the sentence, he would not be an obstacle to leniency. They might determine 
<A NAME="880"></A>as they pleased, and they had free liberty to acquit."
<A NAME="881"></A><BR><BR>This and more to the same effect having been read out, clearly 
<A NAME="882"></A>showing his displeasure, the consuls did not for that reason alter the 
<A NAME="883"></A>terms of the motion, nor did Thrasea withdraw his proposal, or the Senate 
<A NAME="884"></A>reject what it had once approved. Some were afraid of seeming to expose 
<A NAME="885"></A>the emperor to odium; the majority felt safe in numbers, while Thrasea 
<A NAME="886"></A>was supported by his usual firmness of spirit, and a determination not 
<A NAME="887"></A>to let his fame perish.
<A NAME="888"></A><BR><BR>A similar accusation caused the downfall of Fabricius Veiento. 
<A NAME="889"></A>He had composed many libels on senators and pontiffs in a work to which 
<A NAME="890"></A>he gave the title of "Codicils." Talius Geminus, the prosecutor, further 
<A NAME="891"></A>stated that he had habitually trafficked in the emperor's favours and in 
<A NAME="892"></A>the right of promotion. This was Nero's reason for himself undertaking 
<A NAME="893"></A>the trial, and having convicted Veiento, he banished him from Italy, and 
<A NAME="894"></A>ordered the burning of his books, which, while it was dangerous to procure 
<A NAME="895"></A>them, were anxiously sought and much read. Soon full freedom for their 
<A NAME="896"></A>possession caused their oblivion.
<A NAME="897"></A><BR><BR>But while the miseries of the State were daily growing worse, its 
<A NAME="898"></A>supports were becoming weaker. Burrus died, whether from illness or from 
<A NAME="899"></A>poison was a question. It was supposed to be illness from the fact that 
<A NAME="900"></A>from the gradual swelling of his throat inwardly and the closing up of 
<A NAME="901"></A>the passage he ceased to breathe. Many positively asserted that by Nero's 
<A NAME="902"></A>order his throat was smeared with some poisonous drug under the pretence 
<A NAME="903"></A>of the application of a remedy, and that Burrus, who saw through the crime, 
<A NAME="904"></A>when the emperor paid him a visit, recoiled with horror from his gaze, 
<A NAME="905"></A>and merely replied to his question, "I indeed am well." Rome felt for him 
<A NAME="906"></A>a deep and lasting regret, because of the remembrance of his worth, because 
<A NAME="907"></A>too of the merely passive virtue of one of his successors and the very 
<A NAME="908"></A>flagrant iniquities of the other. For the emperor had appointed two men 
<A NAME="909"></A>to the command of the praetorian cohorts, Faenius Rufus, for a vulgar popularity, 
<A NAME="910"></A>which he owed to his administration of the corn-supplies without profit 
<A NAME="911"></A>to himself; and Sofonius Tigellinus, whose inveterate shamelessness and 
<A NAME="912"></A>infamy were an attraction to him. As might have been expected from their 
<A NAME="913"></A>known characters, Tigellinus had the greater influence with the prince, 
<A NAME="914"></A>and was the associate of his most secret profligacy, while Rufus enjoyed 
<A NAME="915"></A>the favour of the people and of the soldiers, and this, he found, prejudiced 
<A NAME="916"></A>him with Nero.
<A NAME="917"></A><BR><BR>The death of Burrus was a blow to Seneca's power, for virtue had 
<A NAME="918"></A>not the same strength when one of its companions, so to say, was removed, 
<A NAME="919"></A>and Nero too began to lean on worse advisers. They assailed Seneca with 
<A NAME="920"></A>various charges, representing that he continued to increase a wealth which 
<A NAME="921"></A>was already so vast as to be beyond the scale of a subject, and was drawing 
<A NAME="922"></A>to himself the attachment of the citizens, while in the picturesqueness 
<A NAME="923"></A>of his gardens and the magnificence of his country houses he almost surpassed 
<A NAME="924"></A>the emperor. They further alleged against him that he claimed for himself 
<A NAME="925"></A>alone the honours of eloquence, and composed poetry more assiduously, as 
<A NAME="926"></A>soon as a passion for it had seized on Nero. "Openly inimical to the prince's 
<A NAME="927"></A>amusements, he disparaged his ability in driving horses, and ridiculed 
<A NAME="928"></A>his voice whenever he sang. When was there to be an end of nothing being 
<A NAME="929"></A>publicly admired but what Seneca was thought to have originated? Surely 
<A NAME="930"></A>Nero's boyhood was over, and he was all but in the prime of youthful manhood. 
<A NAME="931"></A>He ought to shake off a tutor, furnished as he was with sufficiently noble 
<A NAME="932"></A>instructors in his own ancestors."
<A NAME="933"></A><BR><BR>Seneca, meanwhile, aware of these slanders, which were revealed 
<A NAME="934"></A>to him by those who had some respect for merit, coupled with the fact that 
<A NAME="935"></A>the emperor more and more shunned his intimacy, besought the opportunity 
<A NAME="936"></A>of an interview. This was granted, and he spoke as follows:-
<A NAME="937"></A><BR><BR>"It is fourteen years ago, Caesar, that I was first associated 
<A NAME="938"></A>with your prospects, and eight years since you have been emperor. In the 
<A NAME="939"></A>interval, you have heaped on me such honours and riches that nothing is 
<A NAME="940"></A>wanting to my happiness but a right use of it. I will refer to great examples 
<A NAME="941"></A>taken not from my own but from your position. Your great-grandfather Augustus 
<A NAME="942"></A>granted to Marcus Agrippa the calm repose of Mitylene, to Caius Maecenas 
<A NAME="943"></A>what was nearly equivalent to a foreign retreat in the capital itself. 
<A NAME="944"></A>One of these men shared his wars; the other struggled with many laborious 
<A NAME="945"></A>duties at Rome; both received awards which were indeed splendid, but only 
<A NAME="946"></A>proportioned to their great merits. For myself, what other recompense had 
<A NAME="947"></A>I for your munificence, than a culture nursed, so to speak, in the shade 
<A NAME="948"></A>of retirement, and to which a glory attaches itself, because I thus seem 
<A NAME="949"></A>to have helped on the early training of your youth, an ample reward for 
<A NAME="950"></A>the service.
<A NAME="951"></A><BR><BR>"You on the other hand have surrounded me with vast influence and 
<A NAME="952"></A>boundless wealth, so that I often think within myself, Am I, who am but 
<A NAME="953"></A>of an equestrian and provincial family, numbered among the chief men of 
<A NAME="954"></A>Rome? Among nobles who can show a long succession of glories, has my new 
<A NAME="955"></A>name become famous? Where is the mind once content with a humble lot? Is 
<A NAME="956"></A>this the man who is building up his garden terraces, who paces grandly 
<A NAME="957"></A>through these suburban parks, and revels in the affluence of such broad 
<A NAME="958"></A>lands and such widely-spread investments? Only one apology occurs to me, 
<A NAME="959"></A>that it would not have been right in me to have thwarted your 
<A NAME="960"></A>bounty.
<A NAME="961"></A><BR><BR>"And yet we have both filled up our respective measures, you in 
<A NAME="962"></A>giving as much as a prince can bestow on a friend, and I in receiving as 
<A NAME="963"></A>much as a friend can receive from a prince. All else only fosters envy, 
<A NAME="964"></A>which, like all things human, sinks powerless beneath your greatness, though 
<A NAME="965"></A>on me it weighs heavily. To me relief is a necessity. Just as I should 
<A NAME="966"></A>implore support if exhausted by warfare or travel, so in this journey of 
<A NAME="967"></A>life, old as I am and unequal even to the lightest cares, since I cannot 
<A NAME="968"></A>any longer bear the burden of my wealth, I crave assistance. Order my property 
<A NAME="969"></A>to be managed by your agents and to be included in your estate. Still I 
<A NAME="970"></A>shall not sink myself into poverty, but having surrendered the splendours 
<A NAME="971"></A>which dazzle me, I will henceforth again devote to my mind all the leisure 
<A NAME="972"></A>and attention now reserved for my gardens and country houses. You have 
<A NAME="973"></A>yet before you a vigorous prime, and that on which for so many years your 
<A NAME="974"></A>eyes were fixed, supreme power. We, your older friends, can answer for 
<A NAME="975"></A>our quiet behaviour. It will likewise redound to your honour that you have 
<A NAME="976"></A>raised to the highest places men who could also bear moderate 
<A NAME="977"></A>fortune."
<A NAME="978"></A><BR><BR>Nero's reply was substantially this:- "My being able to meet your 
<A NAME="979"></A>elaborate speech with an instant rejoinder is, I consider, primarily your 
<A NAME="980"></A>gift, for you taught me how to express myself not only after reflection 
<A NAME="981"></A>but at a moment's notice. My great-grandfather Augustus allowed Agrippa 
<A NAME="982"></A>and Maecenas to enjoy rest after their labours, but he did it at an age 
<A NAME="983"></A>carrying with it an authority sufficient to justify any boon, of any sort, 
<A NAME="984"></A>he might have bestowed. But neither of them did he strip of the rewards 
<A NAME="985"></A>he had given. It was by war and its perils they had earned them; for in 
<A NAME="986"></A>these the youth of Augustus was spent. And if I had passed my years in 
<A NAME="987"></A>arms, your sword and right hand would not have failed me. But, as my actual 
<A NAME="988"></A>condition required, you watched over my boyhood, then over my youth, with 
<A NAME="989"></A>wisdom, counsel, and advice. And indeed your gifts to me will, as long 
<A NAME="990"></A>as life holds out, be lasting possessions; those which you owe to me, your 
<A NAME="991"></A>parks, investments, your country houses, are liable to accidents. Though 
<A NAME="992"></A>they seem much, many far inferior to you in merit have obtained more. I 
<A NAME="993"></A>am ashamed to quote the names of freedmen who parade a greater wealth. 
<A NAME="994"></A>Hence I actually blush to think that, standing as you do first in my affections, 
<A NAME="995"></A>you do not as yet surpass all in fortune.
<A NAME="996"></A><BR><BR>"Yours too is a still vigorous manhood, quite equal to the labours 
<A NAME="997"></A>of business and to the fruit of those labours; and, as for myself, I am 
<A NAME="998"></A>but treading the threshold of empire. But perhaps you count yourself inferior 
<A NAME="999"></A>to Vitellius, thrice a consul, and me to Claudius. Such wealth as long 
<A NAME="1000"></A>thrift has procured for Volusius, my bounty, you think, cannot fully make 
<A NAME="1001"></A>up to you. Why not rather, if the frailty of my youth goes in any respect 
<A NAME="1002"></A>astray, call me back and guide yet more zealously with your help the manhood 
<A NAME="1003"></A>which you have instructed? It will not be your moderation, if you restore 
<A NAME="1004"></A>me your wealth, not your love of quiet, if you forsake your emperor, but 
<A NAME="1005"></A>my avarice, the fear of my cruelty, which will be in all men's mouths. 
<A NAME="1006"></A>Even if your self-control were praised to the utmost, still it would not 
<A NAME="1007"></A>be seemly in a wise man to get glory for himself in the very act of bringing 
<A NAME="1008"></A>disgrace on his friend."
<A NAME="1009"></A><BR><BR>To these words the emperor added embraces and kisses; for he was 
<A NAME="1010"></A>formed by nature and trained by habit to veil his hatred under delusive 
<A NAME="1011"></A>flattery. Seneca thanked him, the usual end of an interview with a despot. 
<A NAME="1012"></A>But he entirely altered the practices of his former greatness; he kept 
<A NAME="1013"></A>the crowds of his visitors at a distance, avoided trains of followers, 
<A NAME="1014"></A>seldom appeared in Rome, as though weak health or philosophical studies 
<A NAME="1015"></A>detained him at home.
<A NAME="1016"></A><BR><BR>When Seneca had fallen, it was easy to shake the position of Faenius 
<A NAME="1017"></A>Rufus by making Agrippina's friendship a charge against him. Tigellinus, 
<A NAME="1018"></A>who was daily becoming more powerful and who thought that the wicked schemings 
<A NAME="1019"></A>which alone gave him strength, would be better liked if he could secure 
<A NAME="1020"></A>the emperor's complicity in guilt, dived into Nero's most secret apprehensions, 
<A NAME="1021"></A>and, as soon as he had ascertained that Plautus and Sulla were the men 
<A NAME="1022"></A>he most dreaded, Plautus having been lately sent away to Asia, Sulla to 
<A NAME="1023"></A>Gallia Narbonensis, he spoke much of their noble rank and of their respective 
<A NAME="1024"></A>proximity to the armies of the East and of Germany. "I have no eye," he 
<A NAME="1025"></A>said, "like Burrus, to two conflicting aims, but only to Nero's safety, 
<A NAME="1026"></A>which is at least secured against treachery in Rome by my presence. As 
<A NAME="1027"></A>for distant commotions, how can they be checked? Gaul is roused at the 
<A NAME="1028"></A>name of the great dictator, and I distrust no less the nations of Asia, 
<A NAME="1029"></A>because of the renown of such a grandfather as Drusus. Sulla is poor, and 
<A NAME="1030"></A>hence comes his surpassing audacity; he shams apathy, while he is seeking 
<A NAME="1031"></A>an opening for his reckless ambition. Plautus again, with his great wealth, 
<A NAME="1032"></A>does not so much as affect a love of repose, but he flaunts before us his 
<A NAME="1033"></A>imitations of the old Romans, and assumes the self-consciousness of the 
<A NAME="1034"></A>Stoics along with a philosophy, which makes men restless, and eager for 
<A NAME="1035"></A>a busy life."
<A NAME="1036"></A><BR><BR>There was not a moment's delay. Sulla, six days afterwards, was 
<A NAME="1037"></A>murdered by assassins brought over to Massilia, while he was reclining 
<A NAME="1038"></A>at the dinner-table, before he feared or heard of his danger. The head 
<A NAME="1039"></A>was taken to Rome, and Nero scoffed at its premature grey hairs as if they 
<A NAME="1040"></A>were a disfigurement.
<A NAME="1041"></A><BR><BR>It was less of a secret that there was a design to murder Plautus, 
<A NAME="1042"></A>as his life was dear to many. The distance too by land and sea, and the 
<A NAME="1043"></A>interval of time, had given rise to rumours, and the popular story was 
<A NAME="1044"></A>that he had tampered with Corbulo, who was then at the head of great armies, 
<A NAME="1045"></A>and would be a special mark for danger, if illustrious and innocent men 
<A NAME="1046"></A>were to be destroyed. Again Asia, it was said, from its partiality for 
<A NAME="1047"></A>the young man, had taken up arms, and the soldiers sent to do the crime, 
<A NAME="1048"></A>not being sufficient in number or decided in purpose, and, finding themselves 
<A NAME="1049"></A>unable to execute their orders, had gone over to the new cause. These absurdities, 
<A NAME="1050"></A>like all popular gossip, gathered strength from the idle leisure of a credulous 
<A NAME="1051"></A>society.
<A NAME="1052"></A><BR><BR>As it was, one of Plautus's freedmen, thanks to swift winds, arrived 
<A NAME="1053"></A>before the centurion and brought him a message from his father-in-law, 
<A NAME="1054"></A>Lucius Antistius. "He was to avoid the obvious refuge of a coward's death, 
<A NAME="1055"></A>and in the pity felt for a noble name he would soon find good men to help 
<A NAME="1056"></A>him, and daring spirits would rally round him. Meantime no resource was 
<A NAME="1057"></A>to be rejected. If he did but repel sixty soldiers (this was the number 
<A NAME="1058"></A>on the way), while tidings were being carried back to Nero, while another 
<A NAME="1059"></A>force was on its march, many events would follow which would ripen into 
<A NAME="1060"></A>war. Finally, by this plan he either secured safety, or he would suffer 
<A NAME="1061"></A>nothing worse by daring than by cowardice."
<A NAME="1062"></A><BR><BR>But all this had no effect on Plautus. Either he saw no resource 
<A NAME="1063"></A>before him, an unarmed exile as he was, or he was weary of an uncertain 
<A NAME="1064"></A>hope, or was swayed by his love of his wife and of his children, to whom 
<A NAME="1065"></A>he thought the emperor, if harassed by no anxiety, would be more merciful. 
<A NAME="1066"></A>Some say that another message came to him from his father-in-law, representing 
<A NAME="1067"></A>that no dreadful peril hung over him, and that two teachers of philosophy, 
<A NAME="1068"></A>Coeranus from Greece and Musonius from Etruria, advised him to await death 
<A NAME="1069"></A>with firmness rather than lead a precarious and anxious life. At all events, 
<A NAME="1070"></A>he was surprised at midday, when stripped for exercise. In that state the 
<A NAME="1071"></A>centurion slew him in the presence of Pelago, an eunuch, whom Nero had 
<A NAME="1072"></A>set over the centurion and his company, like a despot's minister over his 
<A NAME="1073"></A>satellites.
<A NAME="1074"></A><BR><BR>The head of the murdered man was brought to Rome. At its sight 
<A NAME="1075"></A>the emperor exclaimed (I give his very words), "Why would you have been 
<A NAME="1076"></A>a Nero?" Then casting off all fear he prepared to hurry on his marriage 
<A NAME="1077"></A>with Poppaea, hitherto deferred because of such alarms as I have described, 
<A NAME="1078"></A>and to divorce his wife Octavia, notwithstanding her virtuous life, because 
<A NAME="1079"></A>her father's name and the people's affection for her made her an offence 
<A NAME="1080"></A>to him. He wrote, however, a letter to the Senate, confessing nothing about 
<A NAME="1081"></A>the murders of Sulla and Plautus, but merely hinting that both had a restless 
<A NAME="1082"></A>temper, and that he gave the most anxious thought to the safety of the 
<A NAME="1083"></A>State. On this pretext a thanksgiving was decreed, and also the expulsion 
<A NAME="1084"></A>from the Senate of Sulla and Plautus, more grievous, however, as a farce 
<A NAME="1085"></A>than as an actual calamity.
<A NAME="1086"></A><BR><BR>Nero, on receiving this decree of the Senate and seeing that every 
<A NAME="1087"></A>piece of his wickedness was regarded as a conspicuous merit, drove Octavia 
<A NAME="1088"></A>from him, alleging that she was barren, and then married Poppaea. The woman
