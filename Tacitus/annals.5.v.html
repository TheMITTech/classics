<A NAME="start"></A>
<A NAME="10"></A>A.D. 29-31
<A NAME="11"></A><BR><BR>In the consulship of Rubellius and Fufius, both of whom had the 
<A NAME="12"></A>surname Geminus, died in an advanced old age Julia Augusta. A Claudia by 
<A NAME="13"></A>birth and by adoption a Livia and a Julia, she united the noblest blood 
<A NAME="14"></A>of Rome. Her first marriage, by which she had children, was with Tiberius 
<A NAME="15"></A>Nero, who, an exile during the Perusian war, returned to Rome when peace 
<A NAME="16"></A>had been concluded between Sextus Pompeius and the triumvirs. After this 
<A NAME="17"></A>Caesar, enamoured of her beauty, took her away from her husband, whether 
<A NAME="18"></A>against her wish is uncertain. So impatient was he that he brought her 
<A NAME="19"></A>to his house actually pregnant, not allowing time for her confinement. 
<A NAME="20"></A>She had no subsequent issue, but allied as she was through the marriage 
<A NAME="21"></A>of Agrippina and Germanicus to the blood of Augustus, her great-grandchildren 
<A NAME="22"></A>were also his. In the purity of her home life she was of the ancient type, 
<A NAME="23"></A>but was more gracious than was thought fitting in ladies of former days. 
<A NAME="24"></A>An imperious mother and an amiable wife, she was a match for the diplomacy 
<A NAME="25"></A>of her husband and the dissimulation of her son. Her funeral was simple, 
<A NAME="26"></A>and her will long remained unexecuted. Her panegyric was pronounced from 
<A NAME="27"></A>the Rostra by her great-grandson, Caius Caesar, who afterwards succeeded 
<A NAME="28"></A>to power.
<A NAME="29"></A><BR><BR>Tiberius however, making no change in his voluptuous life, excused 
<A NAME="30"></A>himself by letter for his absence from his last duty to his mother on the 
<A NAME="31"></A>ground of the pressure of business. He even abridged, out of moderation, 
<A NAME="32"></A>as it seemed, the honours which the Senate had voted on a lavish scale 
<A NAME="33"></A>to her memory, allowing only a very few, and adding that no religious worship 
<A NAME="34"></A>was to be decreed, this having been her own wish. In a part of the same 
<A NAME="35"></A>letter he sneered at female friendships, with an indirect censure on the 
<A NAME="36"></A>consul Fufius, who had risen to distinction through Augusta's partiality. 
<A NAME="37"></A>Fufius was indeed a man well fitted to win the affection of a woman; he 
<A NAME="38"></A>was witty too, and accustomed to ridicule Tiberius with those bitter jests 
<A NAME="39"></A>which the powerful remember so long.
<A NAME="40"></A><BR><BR>This at all events was the beginning of an unmitigated and grinding 
<A NAME="41"></A>despotism. As long indeed as Augusta lived, there yet remained a refuge, 
<A NAME="42"></A>for with Tiberius obedience to his mother was the habit of a life, and 
<A NAME="43"></A>Sejanus did not dare to set himself above a parent's authority. Now, so 
<A NAME="44"></A>to say, they threw off the reins and let loose their fury. A letter was 
<A NAME="45"></A>sent, directed against Agrippina and Nero, which was popularly believed 
<A NAME="46"></A>to have been long before forwarded and to have been kept back by Augusta, 
<A NAME="47"></A>as it was publicly read soon after her death. It contained expressions 
<A NAME="48"></A>of studied harshness, yet it was not armed rebellion or a longing for revolution, 
<A NAME="49"></A>but unnatural passions and profligacy which the emperor imputed to his 
<A NAME="50"></A>grandson. Against his daughter-in-law he did not dare to invent this much; 
<A NAME="51"></A>he merely censured her insolent tongue and defiant spirit, amid the panic-stricken 
<A NAME="52"></A>silence of the Senate, till a few who had no hope from merit (and public 
<A NAME="53"></A>calamities are ever used by individuals for interested purposes) demanded 
<A NAME="54"></A>that the question should be debated. The most eager was Cotta Messalinus, 
<A NAME="55"></A>who made a savage speech. Still, the other principal senators, and especially 
<A NAME="56"></A>the magistrates, were perplexed, for Tiberius, notwithstanding his furious 
<A NAME="57"></A>invective, had left everything else in doubt.
<A NAME="58"></A><BR><BR>There was in the Senate one Junius Rusticus, who having been appointed 
<A NAME="59"></A>by the emperor to register its debates was therefore supposed to have an 
<A NAME="60"></A>insight into his secret purposes. This man, whether through some fatal 
<A NAME="61"></A>impulse (he had indeed never before given any evidence of courage) or a 
<A NAME="62"></A>misdirected acuteness which made him tremble at the uncertain future, while 
<A NAME="63"></A>he forgot impending perils, attached himself to the waverers, and warned 
<A NAME="64"></A>the consuls not to enter on the debate. He argued that the highest issues 
<A NAME="65"></A>turned on trivial causes, and that the fall of the house of Germanicus 
<A NAME="66"></A>might one day move the old man's remorse. At the same moment the people, 
<A NAME="67"></A>bearing the images of Agrippina and Nero, thronged round the Senate-house, 
<A NAME="68"></A>and, with words of blessing on the emperor, kept shouting that the letter 
<A NAME="69"></A>was a forgery and that it was not by the prince's will that ruin was being 
<A NAME="70"></A>plotted against his house. And so that day passed without any dreadful 
<A NAME="71"></A>result.
<A NAME="72"></A><BR><BR>Fictitious speeches too against Sejanus were published under the 
<A NAME="73"></A>names of ex-consuls, for several persons indulged, all the more recklessly 
<A NAME="74"></A>because anonymously, the caprice of their imaginations. Consequently the 
<A NAME="75"></A>wrath of Sejanus was the more furious, and he had ground for alleging that 
<A NAME="76"></A>the Senate disregarded the emperor's trouble; that the people were in revolt; 
<A NAME="77"></A>that speeches in a new style and new resolutions were being heard and read. 
<A NAME="78"></A>What remained but to take the sword and chose for their generals and emperors 
<A NAME="79"></A>those whose images they had followed as standards.
<A NAME="80"></A><BR><BR>Upon this the emperor, after repeating his invectives against his 
<A NAME="81"></A>grandson and his daughter-in-law and reprimanding the populace in an edict 
<A NAME="82"></A>complained to the Senate that by the trick of one senator the imperial 
<A NAME="83"></A>dignity had been publicly flouted, and he insisted that, after all, the 
<A NAME="84"></A>whole matter should be left to his exclusive decision. Without further 
<A NAME="85"></A>deliberation, they proceeded, not indeed to pronounce the final sentence 
<A NAME="86"></A>(for this was forbidden), but to declare that they were prepared for vengeance, 
<A NAME="87"></A>and were restrained only by the strong hand of the sovereign.
<A NAME="88"></A><BR><BR>[The remainder of the fifth book and the beginning of the sixth, 
<A NAME="89"></A>recounting Sejanus' marriage and fall and covering a space of nearly three 
<A NAME="90"></A>years, are lost. Newer editions of Tacitus mark the division between the 
<A NAME="91"></A>fifth and sixth books at this point rather than at the end of section 11; 
<A NAME="92"></A>but references are regularly made to the older numbering, and so it has 
<A NAME="93"></A>been retained here. The beginning of section 6 is obviously 
<A NAME="94"></A>fragmentary.]
<A NAME="95"></A><BR><BR>.... forty-four speeches were delivered on this subject, a few 
<A NAME="96"></A>of which were prompted by fear, most by the habit of 
<A NAME="97"></A>flattery...
<A NAME="98"></A><BR><BR>"There is now a change of fortune, and even he who chose Sejanus 
<A NAME="99"></A>to be his colleague and his son-in-law excuses his error. As for the rest, 
<A NAME="100"></A>the man whom they encouraged by shameful baseness, they now wickedly revile. 
<A NAME="101"></A>Which is the most pitiable, to be accused for friendship's sake or to have 
<A NAME="102"></A>to accuse a friend, I cannot decide. I will not put any man's cruelty or 
<A NAME="103"></A>compassion to the test, but, while I am free and have a clear conscience, 
<A NAME="104"></A>I will anticipate peril. I implore you to cherish my memory with joy rather 
<A NAME="105"></A>than with sorrow, numbering me too with those who by noble death have fled 
<A NAME="106"></A>from the miseries of our country."
<A NAME="107"></A><BR><BR>Then detaining those of his friends who were minded to stay with 
<A NAME="108"></A>him and converse, or, if otherwise, dismissing them, he thus spent part 
<A NAME="109"></A>of the day, and with a numerous circle yet round him, all gazing on his 
<A NAME="110"></A>fearless face, and imagining that there was still time to elapse before 
<A NAME="111"></A>the last scene, he fell on a sword which he had concealed in his robe. 
<A NAME="112"></A>The emperor did not pursue him after his death with either accusation or 
<A NAME="113"></A>reproach, although he had heaped a number of foul charges on 
<A NAME="114"></A>Blaesus.
<A NAME="115"></A><BR><BR>Next were discussed the cases of Publius Vitellius and Pomponius 
<A NAME="116"></A>Secundus. The first was charged by his accusers with having offered the 
<A NAME="117"></A>keys of the treasury, of which he was prefect, and the military chest in 
<A NAME="118"></A>aid of a revolution. Against the latter, Considius, an ex-praetor, alleged 
<A NAME="119"></A>intimacy with Aelius Gallus, who, after the punishment of Sejanus, had 
<A NAME="120"></A>fled to the gardens of Pomponius, as his safest refuge. They had no resource 
<A NAME="121"></A>in their peril but in the courageous firmness of their brothers who became 
<A NAME="122"></A>their sureties. Soon, after several adjournments, Vitellius, weary alike 
<A NAME="123"></A>of hope and fear, asked for a penknife, avowedly, for his literary pursuits, 
<A NAME="124"></A>and inflicted a slight wound in his veins, and died at last of a broken 
<A NAME="125"></A>heart. Pomponius, a man of refined manners and brilliant genius, bore his 
<A NAME="126"></A>adverse fortune with resignation, and outlived Tiberius.
<A NAME="127"></A><BR><BR>It was next decided to punish the remaining children of Sejanus, 
<A NAME="128"></A>though the fury of the populace was subsiding, and people generally had 
<A NAME="129"></A>been appeased by the previous executions. Accordingly they were carried 
<A NAME="130"></A>off to prison, the boy, aware of his impending doom, and the little girl, 
<A NAME="131"></A>who was so unconscious that she continually asked what was her offence, 
<A NAME="132"></A>and whither she was being dragged, saying that she would do so no more, 
<A NAME="133"></A>and a childish chastisement was enough for her correction. Historians of 
<A NAME="134"></A>the time tell us that, as there was no precedent for the capital punishment 
<A NAME="135"></A>of a virgin, she was violated by the executioner, with the rope on her 
<A NAME="136"></A>neck. Then they were strangled and their bodies, mere children as they 
<A NAME="137"></A>were, were flung down the Gemoniae.
<A NAME="138"></A><BR><BR>About the same time Asia and Achaia were alarmed by a prevalent 
<A NAME="139"></A>but short-lived rumour that Drusus, the son of Germanicus, had been seen 
<A NAME="140"></A>in the Cyclades and subsequently on the mainland. There was indeed a young 
<A NAME="141"></A>man of much the same age, whom some of the emperor's freedmen pretended 
<A NAME="142"></A>to recognise, and to whom they attached themselves with a treacherous intent. 
<A NAME="143"></A>The renown of the name attracted the ignorant, and the Greek mind eagerly 
<A NAME="144"></A>fastens on what is new and marvellous. The story indeed, which they no 
<A NAME="145"></A>sooner invented than believed, was that Drusus had escaped from custody, 
<A NAME="146"></A>and was on his way to the armies of his father, with the design of invading 
<A NAME="147"></A>Egypt or Syria. And he was now drawing to himself a multitude of young 
<A NAME="148"></A>men and much popular enthusiasm, enjoying the present and cherishing idle 
<A NAME="149"></A>hopes of the future, when Poppaeus Sabinus heard of the affair. At the 
<A NAME="150"></A>time he was chiefly occupied with Macedonia, but he also had the charge 
<A NAME="151"></A>of Achaia. So, to forestall the danger, let the story be true or false, 
<A NAME="152"></A>he hurried by the bays of Torone and Thermae, then passed on to Euboea, 
<A NAME="153"></A>an island of the Aegaean, to Piraeus, on the coast of Attica, thence to 
<A NAME="154"></A>the shores of Corinth and the narrow Isthmus, and having arrived by the 
<A NAME="155"></A>other sea at Nicopolis, a Roman colony, he there at last ascertained that 
<A NAME="156"></A>the man, when skilfully questioned, had said that he was the son of Marcus 
<A NAME="157"></A>Silanus, and that, after the dispersion of a number of his followers' he 
<A NAME="158"></A>had embarked on a vessel, intending, it seemed, to go to Italy. Sabinus 
<A NAME="159"></A>sent this account to Tiberius, and of the origin and issue of the affair 
<A NAME="160"></A>nothing more is known to me.
<A NAME="161"></A><BR><BR>At the close of the year a long growing feud between the consuls 
<A NAME="162"></A>broke out. Trio, a reckless man in incurring enmities and a practised lawyer, 
<A NAME="163"></A>had indirectly censured Regulus as having been half-hearted in crushing 
<A NAME="164"></A>the satellites of Sejanus. Regulus, who, unless he was provoked, loved 
<A NAME="165"></A>quietness, not only repulsed his colleague's attack, but was for dragging 
<A NAME="166"></A>him to trial as a guilty accomplice in the conspiracy. And though many 
<A NAME="167"></A>of the senators implored them to compose a quarrel likely to end fatally, 
<A NAME="168"></A>they continued their enmity and their mutual menaces till they retired 
<A NAME="169"></A>from office.
