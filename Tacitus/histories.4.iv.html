<A NAME="10"></A>January - November, A.D. 70
<A NAME="11"></A><BR><BR>When Vitellius was dead, the war had indeed come to an end, but 
<A NAME="12"></A>peace had yet to begin. Sword in hand, throughout the capital, the conquerors 
<A NAME="13"></A>hunted down the conquered with merciless hatred. The streets were choked 
<A NAME="14"></A>with carnage, the squares and temples reeked with blood, for men were massacred 
<A NAME="15"></A>everywhere as chance threw them in the way. Soon, as their license increased, 
<A NAME="16"></A>they began to search for and drag forth hidden foes. Whenever they saw 
<A NAME="17"></A>a man tall and young they cut him down, making no distinction between soldiers 
<A NAME="18"></A>and civilians. But the ferocity, which in the first impulse of hatred could 
<A NAME="19"></A>be gratified only by blood, soon passed into the greed of gain. They let 
<A NAME="20"></A>nothing be kept secret, nothing be closed; Vitellianists, they pretended, 
<A NAME="21"></A>might be thus concealed. Here was the first step to breaking open private 
<A NAME="22"></A>houses; here, if resistance were made, a pretext for slaughter. The most 
<A NAME="23"></A>needy of the populace and the most worthless of the slaves did not fail 
<A NAME="24"></A>to come forward and betray their wealthy masters; others were denounced 
<A NAME="25"></A>by friends. Everywhere were lamentations, and wailings, and all the miseries 
<A NAME="26"></A>of a captured city, till the license of the Vitellianist and Othonianist 
<A NAME="27"></A>soldiery, once so odious, was remembered with regret. The leaders of the 
<A NAME="28"></A>party, so energetic in kindling civil strife, were incapable of checking 
<A NAME="29"></A>the abuse of victory. In stirring up tumult and strife the worst men can 
<A NAME="30"></A>do the most, but peace and quiet cannot be established without 
<A NAME="31"></A>virtue.
<A NAME="32"></A><BR><BR>Domitian had entered into possession of the title and residence 
<A NAME="33"></A>of Caesar, but not yet applying himself to business, was playing the part 
<A NAME="34"></A>of a son of the throne with debauchery and intrigue. The office of prefect 
<A NAME="35"></A>of the Praetorian Guard was held by Arrius Varus, but the supreme power 
<A NAME="36"></A>was in the hands of Primus Antonius, who carried off money and slaves from 
<A NAME="37"></A>the establishment of the Emperor, as if they were the spoils of Cremona. 
<A NAME="38"></A>The other generals, whose moderation or insignificance had shut them out 
<A NAME="39"></A>from distinction in the war, had accordingly no share in its prizes. The 
<A NAME="40"></A>country, terror-stricken and ready to acquiesce in servitude, urgently 
<A NAME="41"></A>demanded that Lucius Vitellius with his cohorts should be intercepted on 
<A NAME="42"></A>his way from Tarracina, and that the last sparks of war should be trodden 
<A NAME="43"></A>out. The cavalry were sent on to Aricia, the main body of the legions halted 
<A NAME="44"></A>on this side of Bovillae. Without hesitation Vitellius surrendered himself 
<A NAME="45"></A>and his cohorts to the discretion of the conqueror, and the soldiers threw 
<A NAME="46"></A>down their ill-starred arms in rage quite as much as in alarm. The long 
<A NAME="47"></A>train of prisoners, closely guarded by armed men, passed through the capital. 
<A NAME="48"></A>Not one of them wore the look of a suppliant; sullen and savage, they were 
<A NAME="49"></A>unmoved by the shouts and jests of the insulting rabble. A few, who ventured 
<A NAME="50"></A>to break away, were overpowered by the force that hemmed them in; the rest 
<A NAME="51"></A>were thrown into prison. Not one of them uttered an unworthy word; even 
<A NAME="52"></A>in disaster the honour of the soldier was preserved. After this Lucius 
<A NAME="53"></A>Vitellius was executed. Equally vicious with his brother, he had yet shewn 
<A NAME="54"></A>greater vigilance during that brother's reign, and may be said, not so 
<A NAME="55"></A>much to have shared his elevation, as to have been dragged down by his 
<A NAME="56"></A>fall.
<A NAME="57"></A><BR><BR>About the same time Lucilius Bassus was sent with some light cavalry 
<A NAME="58"></A>to establish order in Campania, where the towns were still disturbed, but 
<A NAME="59"></A>by mutual animosities rather than by any spirit of opposition to the new 
<A NAME="60"></A>Emperor. The sight of the soldiery restored quiet, and the smaller colonies 
<A NAME="61"></A>escaped unpunished. At Capua, however, the third legion was stationed to 
<A NAME="62"></A>pass the winter, and the noble families suffered severely. Tarracina, on 
<A NAME="63"></A>the other hand, received no relief; so much more inclined are we to requite 
<A NAME="64"></A>an injury than an obligation. Gratitude is a burden, while there seems 
<A NAME="65"></A>to be a profit in revenge. They were consoled by seeing the slave of Verginius 
<A NAME="66"></A>Capito, whom I have mentioned as the betrayer of Tarracina, gibbeted in 
<A NAME="67"></A>the very rings of knighthood, the gift of Vitellius, which they had seen 
<A NAME="68"></A>him wear. At Rome the Senate, delighted and full of confident hope, decreed 
<A NAME="69"></A>to Vespasian all the honours customarily bestowed on the Emperors. And 
<A NAME="70"></A>indeed the civil war, which, beginning in Gaul and Spain, and afterwards 
<A NAME="71"></A>drawing into the struggle first Germany and then Illyricum, had traversed 
<A NAME="72"></A>Aegypt, Judaea, and Syria, every province, and every army, this war, now 
<A NAME="73"></A>that the whole earth was, as it were, purged from guilt, seemed to have 
<A NAME="74"></A>reached its close. Their alacrity was increased by a letter from Vespasian, 
<A NAME="75"></A>written during the continuance of the war. Such indeed was its character 
<A NAME="76"></A>at first sight; the writer, however, expressed himself as an Emperor, speaking 
<A NAME="77"></A>modestly about himself, in admirable language about the State. There was 
<A NAME="78"></A>no want of deference on the part of the Senate. On the Emperor and his 
<A NAME="79"></A>son Titus the consulship was bestowed by decree; on Domitian the office 
<A NAME="80"></A>of praetor with consular authority.
<A NAME="81"></A><BR><BR>Mucianus had also forwarded to the Senate certain letters which 
<A NAME="82"></A>furnished matter for talk. It was said, "Why, if he is a private citizen, 
<A NAME="83"></A>does he speak like a public man? In a few days' time he might have said 
<A NAME="84"></A>the very same words in his place as a Senator. And even the invective against 
<A NAME="85"></A>Vitellius comes too late, and is ungenerous; while certainly it is arrogance 
<A NAME="86"></A>to the State and an insult to the Emperor to boast that he had the Imperial 
<A NAME="87"></A>power in his hands, and made a present of it to Vespasian." Their dislike, 
<A NAME="88"></A>however, was concealed; their adulation was open enough. In most flattering 
<A NAME="89"></A>language they voted a triumph to Mucianus, a triumph for a civil war, though 
<A NAME="90"></A>the expedition against the Sarmatae was the pretext. On Antonius Primus 
<A NAME="91"></A>were bestowed the insignia of consular rank, on Arrius Varus and Cornelius 
<A NAME="92"></A>Fuscus praetorian honours. Then they remembered the Gods. It was determined 
<A NAME="93"></A>that the Capitol should be restored. All these motions Valerius Asiaticus, 
<A NAME="94"></A>consul elect, proposed. Most of the Senators signified their assent by 
<A NAME="95"></A>their looks, or by raising the hand; but a few, who either held a distinguished 
<A NAME="96"></A>rank, or had a practised talent for flattery, declared their acquiescence 
<A NAME="97"></A>in studied speeches. When it came to the turn of Helvidius Priscus, praetor 
<A NAME="98"></A>elect, to vote, he delivered an opinion, full of respect indeed to a worthy 
<A NAME="99"></A>Emperor, and yet wholly free from insincerity; and he was strongly supported 
<A NAME="100"></A>by the sympathies of the Senate. To Priscus indeed this day was in an especial 
<A NAME="101"></A>manner the beginning of a great quarrel and a great 
<A NAME="102"></A>renown.
<A NAME="103"></A><BR><BR>As I have again happened to mention a man of whom I shall often 
<A NAME="104"></A>have to speak, the subject seems to demand that I should give a brief account 
<A NAME="105"></A>of his life and pursuits, and of his fortunes. Helvidius Priscus was a 
<A NAME="106"></A>native of the town of Carecina in Italy, and was the son of one Cluvius, 
<A NAME="107"></A>who had been a centurion of the first rank. In early youth he devoted his 
<A NAME="108"></A>distinguished talents to the loftiest pursuits, not wishing, as do many, 
<A NAME="109"></A>to cloak under an imposing name a life of indolence, but to be able to 
<A NAME="110"></A>enter upon public life with a spirit fortified against the chances of fortune. 
<A NAME="111"></A>He followed those teachers of philosophy who hold nothing to be good but 
<A NAME="112"></A>what is honourable, nothing evil but what is base, and who refuse to count 
<A NAME="113"></A>either among things good or evil, power, rank, or indeed any thing not 
<A NAME="114"></A>belonging to the mind. While still holding the quaestorship, he was selected 
<A NAME="115"></A>by Paetus Thrasea to be his son-in-law, and from the example of his father-in-law 
<A NAME="116"></A>imbibed with peculiar eagerness a love of liberty. As a citizen and as 
<A NAME="117"></A>a Senator, as a husband, as a son-in-law, as a friend, and in all the relations 
<A NAME="118"></A>of life, he was ever the same, despising wealth, steadily tenacious of 
<A NAME="119"></A>right, and undaunted by danger.
<A NAME="120"></A><BR><BR>There were some who thought him too eager for fame, and indeed 
<A NAME="121"></A>the desire of glory is the last infirmity cast off even by the wise. The 
<A NAME="122"></A>fall of his father-in-law drove him into exile, but he returned when Galba 
<A NAME="123"></A>mounted the throne, and proceeded to impeach Marcellus Eprius, who had 
<A NAME="124"></A>been the informer against Thrasea. This retribution, as great as it was 
<A NAME="125"></A>just, had divided the Senate into two parties; for, if Marcellus fell, 
<A NAME="126"></A>a whole army of fellow culprits was struck down. At first there was a fierce 
<A NAME="127"></A>struggle, as is proved by the great speeches delivered by both men. But 
<A NAME="128"></A>afterwards, as the feelings of Galba were doubtful, and many Senators interceded, 
<A NAME="129"></A>Priscus dropped the charge, amidst comments varying with the tempers of 
<A NAME="130"></A>men, some praising his moderation, and others deploring a lack of courage. 
<A NAME="131"></A>On the day, however, that the Senate was voting about the Imperial dignities 
<A NAME="132"></A>of Vespasian, it had been resolved that envoys should be sent to the new 
<A NAME="133"></A>Emperor. Hence arose a sharp altercation between Helvidius and Eprius. 
<A NAME="134"></A>Priscus proposed that they should be chosen by name by the magistrates 
<A NAME="135"></A>on oath, Marcellus demanded the ballot; and this had been the opinion expressed 
<A NAME="136"></A>by the Consul elect.
<A NAME="137"></A><BR><BR>It was the dread of personal humiliation that made Marcellus so 
<A NAME="138"></A>earnest, for he feared that, if others were chosen, he should himself appear 
<A NAME="139"></A>slighted. From an angry conversation they passed by degrees to long and 
<A NAME="140"></A>bitter speeches. Helvidius asked, "Why should Marcellus be so afraid of 
<A NAME="141"></A>the judgment of the magistrates? He has wealth and eloquence, which might 
<A NAME="142"></A>make him superior to many, were he not oppressed by the consciousness of 
<A NAME="143"></A>guilt. The chances of the ballot do not discriminate men's characters; 
<A NAME="144"></A>the voting and the judgment of the Senate were devised to reach the lives 
<A NAME="145"></A>and reputations of individuals. It concerns the interests of the Commonwealth, 
<A NAME="146"></A>it concerns the honour due to Vespasian, that he should be met by those 
<A NAME="147"></A>whom the Senate counts to be peculiarly blameless, and who may fill the 
<A NAME="148"></A>Emperor's ear with honourable counsels. Vespasian was the friend of Thrasea, 
<A NAME="149"></A>Soranus, and Sextius; and the accusers of these men, though it may not 
<A NAME="150"></A>be expedient to punish them, ought not to be paraded before him. By this 
<A NAME="151"></A>selection on the part of the Senate the Emperor will, so to speak, be advised 
<A NAME="152"></A>whom he should mark with approval, and from whom he should shrink. There 
<A NAME="153"></A>can be no more effectual instrument of good government than good friends. 
<A NAME="154"></A>Let Marcellus be satisfied with having urged Nero to destroy so many innocent 
<A NAME="155"></A>victims; let him enjoy the wages of his crimes and his impunity, but let 
<A NAME="156"></A>him leave Vespasian to worthier advisers."
<A NAME="157"></A><BR><BR>Marcellus declared, "It is not my opinion that is assailed; the 
<A NAME="158"></A>Consul elect has made a motion in accordance with old precedents, which 
<A NAME="159"></A>directed the use of the ballot in the appointment of envoys, in order that 
<A NAME="160"></A>there might be no room for intrigue or private animosities. Nothing has 
<A NAME="161"></A>happened why customs of long standing should fall into disuse, or why the 
<A NAME="162"></A>honour due to the Emperor should be turned into an insult to any man. All 
<A NAME="163"></A>Senators are competent to pay their homage. What we have rather to avoid 
<A NAME="164"></A>is this, that a mind unsettled by the novelty of power, and which will 
<A NAME="165"></A>keenly watch the very looks and language of all, should be irritated by 
<A NAME="166"></A>the obstinacy of certain persons. I do not forget the times in which I 
<A NAME="167"></A>have been born, or the form of government which our fathers and grandfathers 
<A NAME="168"></A>established. I may regard with admiration an earlier period, but I acquiesce 
<A NAME="169"></A>in the present, and, while I pray for good Emperors, I can endure whomsoever 
<A NAME="170"></A>we may have. It was not through my speech any more than it was through 
<A NAME="171"></A>the judgment of the Senate that Thrasea fell. The savage temper of Nero 
<A NAME="172"></A>amused itself under these forms, and I found the friendship of such a Prince 
<A NAME="173"></A>as harassing as others found their exile. Finally, Helvidius may rival 
<A NAME="174"></A>the Catos and the Bruti of old in constancy and courage; I am but one of 
<A NAME="175"></A>the Senate which bows to the same yoke. Besides, I would advise Priscus 
<A NAME="176"></A>not to climb higher than the throne, or to impose his counsels on Vespasian, 
<A NAME="177"></A>an old man, who has won the honours of a triumph, and has two sons grown 
<A NAME="178"></A>to manhood. For as the worst Emperors love an unlimited despotism, so the 
<A NAME="179"></A>noblest like some check on liberty." These speeches, which were delivered 
<A NAME="180"></A>with much vehemence on both sides, were heard with much diversity of feeling. 
<A NAME="181"></A>That party prevailed which preferred that the envoys should be taken by 
<A NAME="182"></A>lot, as even the neutral section in the Senate exerted themselves to retain 
<A NAME="183"></A>the old practice, while the more conspicuous members inclined to the same 
<A NAME="184"></A>view, dreading jealousy, should the choice fall on themselves.
<A NAME="185"></A><BR><BR>Another struggle ensued. The praetors of the Treasury (the Treasury 
<A NAME="186"></A>was at this time managed by praetors) complained of the poverty of the 
<A NAME="187"></A>State, and demanded a retrenchment of expenditure. The Consul elect, considering 
<A NAME="188"></A>how great was the evil and how difficult the remedy, was for reserving 
<A NAME="189"></A>the matter for the Emperor. Helvidius gave it as his opinion that measures 
<A NAME="190"></A>should be taken at the discretion of the Senate. When the Consuls came 
<A NAME="191"></A>to take the votes, Vulcatius Tertullinus, tribune of the people, put his 
<A NAME="192"></A>veto on any resolution being adopted in so important a matter in the absence 
<A NAME="193"></A>of the Emperor. Helvidius had moved that the Capitol should be restored 
<A NAME="194"></A>at the public expense, and that Vespasian should give his aid. All the 
<A NAME="195"></A>more moderate of the Senators let this opinion pass in silence, and in 
<A NAME="196"></A>time forgot it; but there were some who remembered it.
<A NAME="197"></A><BR><BR>Musonius Rufus then made a violent attack on Publius Celer, accusing 
<A NAME="198"></A>him of having brought about the destruction of Barea Soranus by perjury. 
<A NAME="199"></A>By this impeachment all the hatreds of the days of the informers seemed 
<A NAME="200"></A>to be revived; but the accused person was so worthless and so guilty that 
<A NAME="201"></A>he could not be protected. For indeed the memory of Soranus was held in 
<A NAME="202"></A>reverence; Celer had been a professor of philosophy, and had then given 
<A NAME="203"></A>evidence against Barea, thus betraying and profaning the friendship of 
<A NAME="204"></A>which he claimed to be a teacher. The next day was fixed for the trial. 
<A NAME="205"></A>But it was not of Musonius or Publius, it was of Priscus, of Marcellus, 
<A NAME="206"></A>and his brother informers, that men were thinking, now that their hearts 
<A NAME="207"></A>were once roused to vengeance.
<A NAME="208"></A><BR><BR>While things were in this state, while there was division in the 
<A NAME="209"></A>Senate, resentment among the conquered, no real authority in the conquerors, 
<A NAME="210"></A>and in the country at large no laws and no Emperor, Mucianus entered the 
<A NAME="211"></A>capital, and at once drew all power into his own hands. The influence of 
<A NAME="212"></A>Primus Antonius and Varus Arrius was destroyed; for the irritation of Mucianus 
<A NAME="213"></A>against them, though not revealed in his looks, was but ill-concealed, 
<A NAME="214"></A>and the country, keen to discover such dislikes, had changed its tone and 
<A NAME="215"></A>transferred its homage. He alone was canvassed and courted, and he, surrounding 
<A NAME="216"></A>himself with armed men, and bargaining for palaces and gardens, ceased 
<A NAME="217"></A>not, what with his magnificence, his proud bearing, and his guards, to 
<A NAME="218"></A>grasp at the power, while he waived the titles of Empire. The murder of 
<A NAME="219"></A>Calpurnius Galerianus caused the utmost consternation. He was a son of 
<A NAME="220"></A>Caius Piso, and had done nothing, but a noble name and his own youthful 
<A NAME="221"></A>beauty made him the theme of common talk; and while the country was still 
<A NAME="222"></A>unquiet and delighted in novel topics, there were persons who associated 
<A NAME="223"></A>him with idle rumours of Imperial honours. By order of Mucianus he was 
<A NAME="224"></A>surrounded with a guard of soldiers. Lest his execution in the capital 
<A NAME="225"></A>should excite too much notice, they conducted him to the fortieth milestone 
<A NAME="226"></A>from Rome on the Appian Road, and there put him to death by opening his 
<A NAME="227"></A>veins. Julius Priscus, who had been prefect of the Praetorian Guard under 
<A NAME="228"></A>Vitellius, killed himself rather out of shame than by compulsion. Alfenius 
<A NAME="229"></A>Varus survived the disgrace of his cowardice. Asiaticus, who was only a 
<A NAME="230"></A>freedman, expiated by the death of a slave his evil exercise of 
<A NAME="231"></A>power.
<A NAME="232"></A><BR><BR>At this time the country was hearing with anything but sorrow rumours 
<A NAME="233"></A>that daily gained strength of disasters in Germany. Men began to speak 
<A NAME="234"></A>of slaughtered armies, of captured encampments, of Gaul in revolt, as if 
<A NAME="235"></A>such things were not calamities. Beginning at an earlier period I will 
<A NAME="236"></A>discuss the causes in which this war had its origin, and the extent of 
<A NAME="237"></A>the movements which it kindled among independent and allied 
<A NAME="238"></A>nations.
<A NAME="239"></A><BR><BR>The Batavians, while they dwelt on the other side of the Rhine, 
<A NAME="240"></A>formed a part of the tribe of the Chatti. Driven out by a domestic revolution, 
<A NAME="241"></A>they took possession of an uninhabited district on the extremity of the 
<A NAME="242"></A>coast of Gaul, and also of a neighbouring island, surrounded by the ocean 
<A NAME="243"></A>in front, and by the river Rhine in the rear and on either side. Not weakened 
<A NAME="244"></A>by the power of Rome or by alliance with a people stronger than themselves, 
<A NAME="245"></A>they furnished to the Empire nothing but men and arms. They had had a long 
<A NAME="246"></A>training in the German wars, and they had gained further renown in Britain, 
<A NAME="247"></A>to which country their cohorts had been transferred, commanded, according 
<A NAME="248"></A>to ancient custom, by the noblest men in the nation. They had also at home 
<A NAME="249"></A>a select body of cavalry, who practised with special devotion the art of 
<A NAME="250"></A>swimming, so that they could stem the stream of the Rhine with their arms 
<A NAME="251"></A>and horses, without breaking the order of their squadrons.
<A NAME="252"></A><BR><BR>Julius Paullus and Claudius Civilis, scions of the royal family, 
<A NAME="253"></A>ranked very high above the rest of their nation. Paullus was executed by 
<A NAME="254"></A>Fonteius Capito on a false charge of rebellion. Civilis was put in chains 
<A NAME="255"></A>and sent to Nero, and, though acquitted by Galba, again stood in peril 
<A NAME="256"></A>of his life in the time of Vitellius, when the army clamoured for his execution. 
<A NAME="257"></A>Here were causes of deep offence; hence arose hopes built on our disasters. 
<A NAME="258"></A>Civilis, however, was naturally politic to a degree rarely found among 
<A NAME="259"></A>barbarians. He was wont to represent himself as Sertorius or Hannibal, 
<A NAME="260"></A>on the strength of a similar disfigurement of his countenance. To avoid 
<A NAME="261"></A>the opposition which he would encounter as a public enemy, were he openly 
<A NAME="262"></A>to revolt from Rome, he affected a friendship for Vespasian and a zealous 
<A NAME="263"></A>attachment to his party; and indeed a letter had been despatched to him 
<A NAME="264"></A>by Primus Antonius, in which he was directed to divert the reinforcements 
<A NAME="265"></A>which Vitellius had called up, and to keep the legions where they were 
<A NAME="266"></A>by the feint of an outbreak in Germany. The same policy was suggested by 
<A NAME="267"></A>Hordeonius in person; he had a bias towards Vespasian, and feared for the 
<A NAME="268"></A>Empire, the utter ruin of which would be very near, were a fresh war with 
<A NAME="269"></A>so many thousands of armed men to burst upon Italy.
<A NAME="270"></A><BR><BR>Civilis, who was resolved on rebellion, and intended, while concealing 
<A NAME="271"></A>his ulterior designs, to reveal his other plans as occasion presented itself, 
<A NAME="272"></A>set about the work of revolution in this way. By command of Vitellius all 
<A NAME="273"></A>the Batavian youth was then being summoned to the conscription, a thing 
<A NAME="274"></A>naturally vexatious, and which the officials made yet more burdensome by 
<A NAME="275"></A>their rapacity and profligacy, while they selected aged and infirm persons, 
<A NAME="276"></A>whom they might discharge for a consideration, and mere striplings, but 
<A NAME="277"></A>of distinguished beauty (and many attained even in boyhood to a noble stature), 
<A NAME="278"></A>whom they dragged off for infamous purposes. This caused indignation, and 
<A NAME="279"></A>the ringleaders of the concerted rebellion prevailed upon the people to 
<A NAME="280"></A>refuse the conscription. Civilis collected at one of the sacred groves, 
<A NAME="281"></A>ostensibly for a banquet, the chiefs of the nation and the boldest spirits 
<A NAME="282"></A>of the lower class. When he saw them warmed with the festivities of the 
<A NAME="283"></A>night, he began by speaking of the renown and glory of their race, and 
<A NAME="284"></A>then counted the wrongs and the oppressions which they endured, and all 
<A NAME="285"></A>the other evils of slavery. "There is," he said, "no alliance, as once 
<A NAME="286"></A>there was; we are treated as slaves. When does even a legate come among 
<A NAME="287"></A>us, though he come only with a burdensome retinue and in all the haughtiness 
<A NAME="288"></A>of power? We are handed over to prefects and centurions, and when they 
<A NAME="289"></A>are glutted with our spoils and our blood, then they are changed, and new 
<A NAME="290"></A>receptacles for plunder, new terms for spoliation, are discovered. Now 
<A NAME="291"></A>the conscription is at hand, tearing, we may say, for ever children from 
<A NAME="292"></A>parents, and brothers from brothers. Never has the power of Rome been more 
<A NAME="293"></A>depressed. In the winter quarters of the legions there is nothing but property 
<A NAME="294"></A>to plunder and a few old men. Only dare to look up, and cease to tremble 
<A NAME="295"></A>at the empty names of legions. For we have a vast force of horse and foot; 
<A NAME="296"></A>we have the Germans our kinsmen; we have Gaul bent on the same objects. 
<A NAME="297"></A>Even to the Roman people this war will not be displeasing; if defeated, 
<A NAME="298"></A>we shall still reckon it a service to Vespasian, and for success no account 
<A NAME="299"></A>need be rendered."
<A NAME="300"></A><BR><BR>Having been listened to with great approval, he bound the whole 
<A NAME="301"></A>assembly with barbarous rites and the national forms of oath. Envoys were 
<A NAME="302"></A>sent to the Canninefates to urge a common policy. This is a tribe which 
<A NAME="303"></A>inhabits part of the island, and closely resembles the Batavians in their 
<A NAME="304"></A>origin, their language, and their courageous character, but is inferior 
<A NAME="305"></A>in numbers. After this he sent messengers to tamper with the British auxiliaries 
<A NAME="306"></A>and with the Batavian cohorts, who, as I have before related, had been 
<A NAME="307"></A>sent into Germany, and were then stationed at Mogontiacum. Among the Canninefates 
<A NAME="308"></A>there was a certain Brinno, a man of a certain stolid bravery and of distinguished 
<A NAME="309"></A>birth. His father, after venturing on many acts of hostility, had scorned 
<A NAME="310"></A>with impunity the ridiculous expedition of Caligula. His very name, the 
<A NAME="311"></A>name of a family of rebels, made him popular. Raised aloft on a shield 
<A NAME="312"></A>after the national fashion, and balanced on the shoulders of the bearers, 
<A NAME="313"></A>he was chosen general. Immediately summoning to arms the Frisii, a tribe 
<A NAME="314"></A>of the farther bank of the Rhine, he assailed by sea the winter quarters 
<A NAME="315"></A>of two cohorts, which was the nearest point to attack. The soldiers had 
<A NAME="316"></A>not anticipated the assault of the enemy; even had they done so, they had 
<A NAME="317"></A>not strength to repulse it. Thus the camp was taken and plundered. Then 
<A NAME="318"></A>the enemy fell upon the sutlers and Roman traders, who were wandering about 
<A NAME="319"></A>in every direction, as they would in a time of peace. At the same time 
<A NAME="320"></A>they were on the point of destroying the forts, but the prefects of the 
<A NAME="321"></A>cohorts, seeing that they could not hold them, set them on fire. The standards, 
<A NAME="322"></A>the colours, and what soldiers there were, concentrated themselves in the 
<A NAME="323"></A>upper part of the island under the command of Aquilius, a centurion of 
<A NAME="324"></A>the first rank, an army in name rather than in strength. Vitellius in fact, 
<A NAME="325"></A>after withdrawing the effective troops from the cohorts, had loaded with 
<A NAME="326"></A>arms a crowd of idlers from the neighbouring villages of the Nervii and 
<A NAME="327"></A>the Germans.
<A NAME="328"></A><BR><BR>Civilis, thinking that he must proceed by craft, actually blamed 
<A NAME="329"></A>the prefects for having deserted the forts, saying that he would himself, 
<A NAME="330"></A>with the cohort under his command, quell the disturbance among the Canninefates, 
<A NAME="331"></A>and that they had better return to their respective winter quarters. It 
<A NAME="332"></A>was evident, however, that there was some treacherous design beneath this 
<A NAME="333"></A>advice, that the cohorts would be dispersed only to be more easily crushed, 
<A NAME="334"></A>and that the guiding hand in the war was not Brinno but Civilis; for indications 
<A NAME="335"></A>of the truth, which the Germans, a people who delight in war, could not 
<A NAME="336"></A>long conceal, were gradually coming to light. When stratagem proved ineffectual, 
<A NAME="337"></A>he resorted to force, arranging in distinct columns the Canninefates, the 
<A NAME="338"></A>Batavians, and the Frisii. The Roman army was drawn up to meet them not 
<A NAME="339"></A>far from the river Rhine, and the ships, which, after burning the forts, 
<A NAME="340"></A>they had stranded at that point, were arranged so as to front the enemy. 
<A NAME="341"></A>Before the struggle had lasted long, a cohort of Tungrians carried over 
<A NAME="342"></A>their standards to Civilis. The other troops, paralysed by the unexpected 
<A NAME="343"></A>desertion, were cut down alike by friends and foes. In the fleet there 
<A NAME="344"></A>was the same treachery. Some of the rowers were Batavians, and they hindered 
<A NAME="345"></A>the operations of the sailors and combatants by an apparent want of skill; 
<A NAME="346"></A>then they began to back water, and to run the sterns on to the hostile 
<A NAME="347"></A>shore. At last they killed the pilots and centurions, unless these were 
<A NAME="348"></A>willing to join them. The end was that the whole fleet of four and twenty 
<A NAME="349"></A>vessels either deserted or was taken.
<A NAME="350"></A><BR><BR>For the moment this was a brilliant success, and it had its use 
<A NAME="351"></A>for the future. They possessed themselves of some arms and some vessels, 
<A NAME="352"></A>both of which they wanted, while they became very famous throughout Germany 
<A NAME="353"></A>as the champions of liberty. The tribes of Germany immediately sent envoys 
<A NAME="354"></A>with offers of troops. The co-operation of Gaul Civilis endeavoured to 
<A NAME="355"></A>secure by politic liberality, sending back to their respective states the 
<A NAME="356"></A>captured prefects of cohorts, and giving permission to their men to go 
<A NAME="357"></A>or stay as they preferred. He offered to those who stayed service on honourable 
<A NAME="358"></A>terms, to those who departed the spoils of the Roman army. At the same 
<A NAME="359"></A>time he reminded them in confidential conversations of the wrongs which 
<A NAME="360"></A>they had endured for so many years, while they falsely gave to a wretched 
<A NAME="361"></A>slavery the name of peace. "The Batavians," he said, "though free of tribute, 
<A NAME="362"></A>have yet taken up arms against our common masters. In the first conflict 
<A NAME="363"></A>the soldiers of Rome have been routed and vanquished. What will be the 
<A NAME="364"></A>result if Gaul throws off the yoke? What strength is there yet left in 
<A NAME="365"></A>Italy? It is by the blood of the provinces that the provinces are conquered. 
<A NAME="366"></A>Think not of how it fared with the armies of Vindex. It was by Batavian 
<A NAME="367"></A>cavalry that the Aedui and the Arverni were trampled down, and among the 
<A NAME="368"></A>auxiliaries of Verginius there were found Belgian troops. To those who 
<A NAME="369"></A>will estimate the matter aright it is evident that Gaul fell by her own 
<A NAME="370"></A>strength. But now all are on the same side, and we have whatever remnant 
<A NAME="371"></A>of military vigour still flourished in the camps of Rome. With us too are 
<A NAME="372"></A>the veteran cohorts to which the legions of Otho lately succumbed. Let 
<A NAME="373"></A>Syria, Asia Minor, and the East, habituated as it is to despotism, submit 
<A NAME="374"></A>to slavery; there are many yet alive in Gaul who were born before the days 
<A NAME="375"></A>of tribute. It was only lately indeed that Quintilius Varus was slain, 
<A NAME="376"></A>and slavery driven out of Germany. And the Emperor who was challenged by 
<A NAME="377"></A>that war was not a Vitellius, but a Caesar Augustus. Freedom is a gift 
<A NAME="378"></A>bestowed by nature even on the dumb animals. Courage is the peculiar excellence 
<A NAME="379"></A>of man, and the Gods help the braver side. Let us then, who are free to 
<A NAME="380"></A>act and vigorous, fall on a distracted and exhausted enemy. While some 
<A NAME="381"></A>are supporting Vespasian, and others Vitellius, opportunities are opening 
<A NAME="382"></A>up for acting against both."
<A NAME="383"></A><BR><BR>Civilis, bent on winning Gaul and Germany if his purposes should 
<A NAME="384"></A>prosper, was on the point of securing supremacy over the most powerful 
<A NAME="385"></A>and most wealthy of the states. His first attempts Hordeonius Flaccus had 
<A NAME="386"></A>encouraged by affecting ignorance. But when messengers came hurrying in 
<A NAME="387"></A>with intelligence that a camp had been stormed, that cohorts had been cut 
<A NAME="388"></A>to pieces, and that the Roman power had been expelled from the island of 
<A NAME="389"></A>the Batavians, the general ordered the legate, Munius Lupercus, who was 
<A NAME="390"></A>in command of the winter quarters of two legions, to advance against the 
<A NAME="391"></A>enemy. Lupercus in great haste threw across the Rhine such legionaries 
<A NAME="392"></A>as were on the spot, some Ubian troops who were close at hand, and some 
<A NAME="393"></A>cavalry of the Treveri, who were stationed at no great distance; these 
<A NAME="394"></A>were accompanied by some Batavian horse, who, though they had been long 
<A NAME="395"></A>disaffected, yet still simulated loyalty in order that by betraying the 
<A NAME="396"></A>Romans in the moment of actual conflict they might receive a higher price 
<A NAME="397"></A>for their desertion. Civilis, surrounding himself with the standards of 
<A NAME="398"></A>the captured cohorts, to keep their recent honours before the eyes of his 
<A NAME="399"></A>own men, and to terrify the enemy by the remembrance of defeat, now directed 
<A NAME="400"></A>his own mother and sisters, and the wives and children of all his men, 
<A NAME="401"></A>to stand in the rear, where they might encourage to victory, or shame defeat. 
<A NAME="402"></A>The war-song of the men, and the shrill cries of the women, rose from the 
<A NAME="403"></A>whole line, and an answering but far less vigorous cheer, came from the 
<A NAME="404"></A>legions and auxiliaries. The Batavians had exposed the left wing by their 
<A NAME="405"></A>desertion, and they immediately turned against our men. Still the legionaries, 
<A NAME="406"></A>though their position was alarming, kept their arms and their ranks. The 
<A NAME="407"></A>auxiliaries of the Ubii and the Treveri broke at once in shameful flight, 
<A NAME="408"></A>and dispersed over the whole country. On that side the Germans threw the 
<A NAME="409"></A>weight of their attack. Meanwhile the legions had an opportunity of retreating 
<A NAME="410"></A>into what was called the Old Camp. Claudius Labeo, prefect of the Batavian 
<A NAME="411"></A>horse, who had been the rival of Civilis in some local contest, was sent 
<A NAME="412"></A>away into the country of the Frisii; to kill him might be to give offence 
<A NAME="413"></A>to his countrymen, while to keep him with the army might be to sow the 
<A NAME="414"></A>seeds of discord.
<A NAME="415"></A><BR><BR>About the same time the messenger despatched by Civilis came up 
<A NAME="416"></A>with the cohorts of the Batavians and the Canninefates, while by the orders 
<A NAME="417"></A>of Vitellius they were advancing towards Rome. At once, inflated with pride 
<A NAME="418"></A>and haughtiness, they demanded, by way of remuneration for their march, 
<A NAME="419"></A>a donative, double pay, and an increase in the number of cavalry, things 
<A NAME="420"></A>indeed which Vitellius had promised, but which they now asked, not with 
<A NAME="421"></A>the thought of obtaining them, but as a pretext for mutiny. Flaccus, by 
<A NAME="422"></A>his many concessions, had produced no other effect but to make them insist 
<A NAME="423"></A>with more energy on what they knew he must refuse. Treating him with contempt, 
<A NAME="424"></A>they made their way towards Lower Germany, to join Civilis. Hordeonius, 
<A NAME="425"></A>assembling the tribunes and centurions, asked their opinion as to whether 
<A NAME="426"></A>he should use coercion with those who refused obedience. Soon, yielding 
<A NAME="427"></A>to his natural timidity and to the alarm of his officers, who were troubled 
<A NAME="428"></A>by the suspicious temper of the auxiliaries and by the fact that the ranks 
<A NAME="429"></A>of the legions had been recruited by a hurried conscription, he resolved 
<A NAME="430"></A>to confine his troops to the camp. Then, repenting of his resolve, and 
<A NAME="431"></A>finding that the very men who had advised it now disapproved it, he seemed 
<A NAME="432"></A>bent on pursuing the enemy, and wrote to Herennius Gallus, legate of the 
<A NAME="433"></A>first legion, who was then holding Bonna, that he was to prevent the Batavians 
<A NAME="434"></A>from crossing the Rhine, and that he would himself hang on their rear with 
<A NAME="435"></A>his army. They might have been crushed, if Hordeonius, moving from one 
<A NAME="436"></A>side, and Gallus from the other, had enclosed them between their armies. 
<A NAME="437"></A>But Flaccus abandoned his purpose, and, in other despatches to Gallus, 
<A NAME="438"></A>recommended him not to threaten the departing foe. Thence arose a suspicion 
<A NAME="439"></A>that the war was being kindled with the consent of the legates, and that 
<A NAME="440"></A>everything which had happened, or was apprehended, was due, not to the 
<A NAME="441"></A>cowardice of the troops, or to the strength of the enemy, but to the treachery 
<A NAME="442"></A>of the generals.
<A NAME="443"></A><BR><BR>When the Batavians were near the camp at Bonna, they sent on before 
<A NAME="444"></A>them delegates, commissioned to deliver to Herennius Gallus a message from 
<A NAME="445"></A>the cohorts. It was to this effect: "We have no quarrel with the Romans, 
<A NAME="446"></A>for whom we have so often fought. Wearied with a protracted and fruitless 
<A NAME="447"></A>service, we long for our native land and for rest. If no one oppose us, 
<A NAME="448"></A>our march will be harmless, but if an armed force encounter us, we will 
<A NAME="449"></A>make a way with the sword." The soldiers prevailed upon the hesitating 
<A NAME="450"></A>legate to risk the chances of a battle. Three thousand legionaries, some 
<A NAME="451"></A>raw Belgian cohorts, and with them a mob of rustics and camp-followers, 
<A NAME="452"></A>cowardly, but bold of speech before the moment of danger, rushed out of 
<A NAME="453"></A>all the gates, thinking to surround the Batavians, who were inferior in 
<A NAME="454"></A>number. But the enemy, being veteran troops, formed in columns, presenting 
<A NAME="455"></A>on every side a dense array, with front, flanks, and rear secure. Thus 
<A NAME="456"></A>they were able to break the thin line of our soldiers. The Belgians giving 
<A NAME="457"></A>way, the legion was driven back, retreating in confusion on the entrenchments 
<A NAME="458"></A>and the gates. It was there that the greatest slaughter took place. The 
<A NAME="459"></A>trenches were heaped up with corpses. Nor was it only from the deadly blows 
<A NAME="460"></A>of the enemy that they suffered; many perished in the crush and by their 
<A NAME="461"></A>own weapons. The victorious army, who avoided the Colonia Agrippinensis, 
<A NAME="462"></A>did not venture on any other hostile act during the remainder of their 
<A NAME="463"></A>march, and excused the conflict at Bonna, alleging that they had asked 
<A NAME="464"></A>for peace, and that when it was refused they had but looked to their own 
<A NAME="465"></A>safety.
<A NAME="466"></A><BR><BR>Civilis, who now on the arrival of these veteran cohorts was at 
<A NAME="467"></A>the head of a complete army, but who was undecided in his plans, and still 
<A NAME="468"></A>reflected on the power of Rome, made all who were with him swear allegiance 
<A NAME="469"></A>to Vespasian, and sent envoys to the two legions which after their defeat 
<A NAME="470"></A>in the previous engagement had retreated into the Old Camp, advising them 
<A NAME="471"></A>to accept the same allegiance. Their reply was: "We do not follow the advice 
<A NAME="472"></A>of traitors or enemies. Vitellius is our Emperor; to him we will retain 
<A NAME="473"></A>our fealty and devote our swords till our last breath. Then let not a Batavian 
<A NAME="474"></A>refugee affect to decide the destinies of Rome; let him rather await the 
<A NAME="475"></A>merited penalty of his guilt." When this reply was delivered to Civilis, 
<A NAME="476"></A>he was furious with anger, and hurried the whole Batavian nation into open 
<A NAME="477"></A>war. The Bructeri and the Tencteri joined him, and messengers summoned 
<A NAME="478"></A>all Germany to share in his plunder and his glory.
<A NAME="479"></A><BR><BR>To meet the threatened dangers of the gathering war, the legates 
<A NAME="480"></A>of the legions, Munius Lupercus and Numisius Rufus, strengthened their 
<A NAME="481"></A>entrenchments and walls. The buildings, which during a long period of peace 
<A NAME="482"></A>had grown up like a town near the camp, were destroyed, lest they might 
<A NAME="483"></A>be useful to the enemy. Little care, however, was taken about the conveyance 
<A NAME="484"></A>of supplies into the camp. These the generals allowed to be plundered; 
<A NAME="485"></A>and so, what might long have sufficed for their necessities, was wantonly 
<A NAME="486"></A>wasted in a few days. Civilis, who occupied the centre of the army with 
<A NAME="487"></A>the elite of the Batavian troops, wishing to add a new terror to his demonstration, 
<A NAME="488"></A>covered both banks of the Rhine with columns of his German allies, while 
<A NAME="489"></A>his cavalry galloped about the plains. At the same time the fleet was moved 
<A NAME="490"></A>up the stream. Here were the standards of the veteran cohorts; there the 
<A NAME="491"></A>images of wild beasts, brought out of the woods and sacred groves, under 
<A NAME="492"></A>the various forms which each tribe is used to follow into battle, and these 
<A NAME="493"></A>mingled emblems of civil and of foreign warfare utterly confounded the 
<A NAME="494"></A>besieged. The extent of the entrenchment raised the hopes of the besiegers. 
<A NAME="495"></A>Constructed for two legions, it was now held by not more than five thousand 
<A NAME="496"></A>Roman soldiers. But there was with them a great number of camp-followers, 
<A NAME="497"></A>who had assembled there on the disturbance of peace, and who could be employed 
<A NAME="498"></A>in the contest.
<A NAME="499"></A><BR><BR>Part of the camp occupied the gentle slope of a hill; to part was 
<A NAME="500"></A>a level approach. By this encampment Augustus had thought the German tribes 
<A NAME="501"></A>might be watched and checked; never had he contemplated such a pitch of 
<A NAME="502"></A>disaster, as that these tribes should themselves advance to attack our 
<A NAME="503"></A>legions. Hence no labour was bestowed on the ground or on the defences. 
<A NAME="504"></A>Our valour and our arms seemed defence enough. The Batavians and the Transrhenane 
<A NAME="505"></A>tribes took up their position, each tribe by itself, to distinguish and 
<A NAME="506"></A>so the better to display the valour of each; first annoying us by a distant 
<A NAME="507"></A>volley; then, as they found that very many of their missiles fixed themselves 
<A NAME="508"></A>harmlessly in the turrets and battlements of the walls, and they themselves 
<A NAME="509"></A>suffered from the stones showered down on them, they fell on the entrenchment 
<A NAME="510"></A>with a shout and furious rush, many placing their scaling-ladders against 
<A NAME="511"></A>the ramparts, and others mounting on a testudo formed by their comrades. 
<A NAME="512"></A>Some were in the act of climbing over when they were thrust down by the 
<A NAME="513"></A>swords of the enemy, and fell overwhelmed by a storm of javelins and stakes. 
<A NAME="514"></A>Always very daring at first and excessively elated by success, they now 
<A NAME="515"></A>in their eagerness for plunder bore up against reverse. They also ventured 
<A NAME="516"></A>to use what to them was a novelty, engines of war; they had themselves 
<A NAME="517"></A>no skill in handling them, but the prisoners and deserters taught them 
<A NAME="518"></A>to pile up timber in the shape of a bridge, under which they put wheels, 
<A NAME="519"></A>and so propelled it, some standing on the top, and fighting as they would 
<A NAME="520"></A>from an earth-work, others concealing themselves within and undermining 
<A NAME="521"></A>the walls. But the stones thrown by the catapults prostrated the ill-constructed 
<A NAME="522"></A>fabric, and when they set themselves to prepare hurdles and mantlets, burning 
<A NAME="523"></A>spears were thrown on them by the engines, fire being thus actually used 
<A NAME="524"></A>against the assailants. At last, despairing of success by force, they changed 
<A NAME="525"></A>their plans, and resolved to wait, for they were well aware that only a 
<A NAME="526"></A>few days' provisions were in the camp, and that there was a great crowd 
<A NAME="527"></A>on non-combatants; and they counted at the same time on the treachery that 
<A NAME="528"></A>might follow on scarcity, on the wavering fidelity of the slaves, and on 
<A NAME="529"></A>the chances of war.
<A NAME="530"></A><BR><BR>Meanwhile Flaccus, who had heard of the siege of the camp, and 
<A NAME="531"></A>had sent into all parts of Gaul to collect auxiliaries, put under command 
<A NAME="532"></A>of Dillius Vocula, legate of the 18th legion, some troops picked from the 
<A NAME="533"></A>legions with orders to hasten by forced marches along the banks of the 
<A NAME="534"></A>Rhine. Flaccus himself, who was weak in health and disliked by his troops, 
<A NAME="535"></A>travelled with the fleet. The troops indeed complained in unmistakable 
<A NAME="536"></A>language that their general had despatched the Batavian cohorts from Mogontiacum, 
<A NAME="537"></A>had feigned ignorance of the plans of Civilis, and was inviting the German 
<A NAME="538"></A>tribes to join the league. "This," they said, "has strengthened Vespasian 
<A NAME="539"></A>no less than the exertions of Primus Antonius and Mucianus. Declared enmity 
<A NAME="540"></A>and hostility may be openly repulsed, but treachery and fraud work in darkness, 
<A NAME="541"></A>and so cannot be avoided. Civilis stands in arms against us, and arranges 
<A NAME="542"></A>the order of his battle; Hordeonius from his chamber or his litter gives 
<A NAME="543"></A>such orders as may best serve the enemy. The swords of thousands of brave 
<A NAME="544"></A>men are directed by one old man's sick caprice. How much better by slaying 
<A NAME="545"></A>the traitor, to set free our valour and our fortune from these evil auspices!" 
<A NAME="546"></A>The passions already kindled by the language which they thus held among 
<A NAME="547"></A>themselves were yet more inflamed by a despatch from Vespasian, which Flaccus, 
<A NAME="548"></A>finding that it could not be concealed, read before an assembly of the 
<A NAME="549"></A>troops, sending the persons who had brought it in chains to 
<A NAME="550"></A>Vitellius.
<A NAME="551"></A><BR><BR>With feelings somewhat appeased, they arrived at Bonna, the winter-camp 
<A NAME="552"></A>of the first legion. The troops there were even more enraged against Hordeonius, 
<A NAME="553"></A>and laid on him the blame of the late disaster. They said that it was by 
<A NAME="554"></A>his orders that they had offered battle to the Batavians, supposing that 
<A NAME="555"></A>the legions from Mogontiacum were following them; that it was through his 
<A NAME="556"></A>treachery that they had been slaughtered, no reinforcements coming up; 
<A NAME="557"></A>that all these events were unknown to the other legions, and were not told 
<A NAME="558"></A>to their Emperor, though the sudden outburst of treason might have been 
<A NAME="559"></A>crushed by the prompt action of so many provinces. Hordeonius read to the 
<A NAME="560"></A>army copies of all the letters which he had sent about Gaul, begging for 
<A NAME="561"></A>reinforcements, and established as a precedent a most disgraceful practice, 
<A NAME="562"></A>namely, the handing over the despatches to the standard-bearers of the 
<A NAME="563"></A>legions, through whose means they were read by the soldiers sooner than 
<A NAME="564"></A>by the generals. He then ordered one of the mutineers to be put in irons, 
<A NAME="565"></A>more for the sake of asserting his authority than because any one man was 
<A NAME="566"></A>in fault. The army was then moved from Bonna to the Colonia Agrippinensis, 
<A NAME="567"></A>while auxiliaries from Gaul continued to flow in; for at first that nation 
<A NAME="568"></A>zealously supported the cause of Rome. Soon indeed as the Germans increased 
<A NAME="569"></A>in power, many of the states took up arms against us, moved by the hope 
<A NAME="570"></A>of freedom and, could they once shake off the yoke, even by the lust of 
<A NAME="571"></A>empire. The irritation of the legions still increased, nor had the imprisonment 
<A NAME="572"></A>of a single soldier struck them with terror. This fellow indeed actually 
<A NAME="573"></A>charged the general with complicity; he had, he said, acted as a messenger 
<A NAME="574"></A>between Civilis and Flaccus, and because he might tell the truth he was 
<A NAME="575"></A>now being crushed under a false charge. With wonderful firmness Vocula 
<A NAME="576"></A>ascended the tribunal, and ordered the man, who had been seized by the 
<A NAME="577"></A>lictors, and was loudly remonstrating, to be led off to execution. All 
<A NAME="578"></A>the best men acquiesced in the order, while the ill-affected were struck 
<A NAME="579"></A>with terror. Then, as all with common consent demanded that Vocula should 
<A NAME="580"></A>be their general, Hordeonius handed over to him the supreme 
<A NAME="581"></A>command.
<A NAME="582"></A><BR><BR>But there were many things to exasperate the already divided feelings 
<A NAME="583"></A>of the soldiery. Pay and provisions were scanty, Gaul was rebelling against 
<A NAME="584"></A>conscription and taxes, while the Rhine, owing to a drought unexampled 
<A NAME="585"></A>in that climate, would hardly admit of navigation, and thus supplies were 
<A NAME="586"></A>straitened at the same time that outposts had to be established along the 
<A NAME="587"></A>entire bank to keep the Germans from fording the stream; the self-same 
<A NAME="588"></A>cause thus bringing about a smaller supply of grain and a greater number 
<A NAME="589"></A>of consumers. Among ignorant persons the very failure of the stream was 
<A NAME="590"></A>regarded as a prodigy, as if the very rivers, the old defences of the Empire, 
<A NAME="591"></A>were deserting us. What, in peace, would have seemed chance or nature, 
<A NAME="592"></A>was now spoken of as destiny and the anger of heaven. As the army entered 
<A NAME="593"></A>Novesium the sixteenth legion joined it; Herennius Gallus, its legate, 
<A NAME="594"></A>was associated with Vocula in the responsibilities of command. As they 
<A NAME="595"></A>did not venture to advance upon the enemy, they constructed a camp at a 
<A NAME="596"></A>place called Gelduba. Here the generals sought to give steadiness to the 
<A NAME="597"></A>troops by such exercises as forming in order of battle, constructing fortifications, 
<A NAME="598"></A>making entrenchments, and whatever else might train them for war. In the 
<A NAME="599"></A>hope that they might be fired to courage by the delights of plunder, Vocula 
<A NAME="600"></A>led the army against the nearest villages of the Gugerni, who had accepted 
<A NAME="601"></A>the alliance of Civilis. Some of the troops remained permanently with Herennius 
<A NAME="602"></A>Gallus.
<A NAME="603"></A><BR><BR>One day it happened that at no great distance from the camp the 
<A NAME="604"></A>Germans were endeavouring to drag off to their own bank a vessel laden 
<A NAME="605"></A>with corn, which had run aground in the shallows. Gallus could not endure 
<A NAME="606"></A>this, and sent a cohort to help. The numbers of the Germans also increased; 
<A NAME="607"></A>as fresh troops continued to join both sides, a regular battle ensued. 
<A NAME="608"></A>The Germans, besides inflicting great loss on our men, carried off the 
<A NAME="609"></A>vessel. The vanquished troops, following what had become a regular practice, 
<A NAME="610"></A>laid the blame not on their own cowardice, but on supposed treachery in 
<A NAME="611"></A>the legate. Dragged out of his tent, his garments torn, and his person 
<A NAME="612"></A>severely beaten, he was commanded to declare for what bribe and with what 
<A NAME="613"></A>accomplices he had betrayed the army. Their old hatred of Hordeonius reappeared. 
<A NAME="614"></A>He, they declared, was the instigator of the crime, Gallus his tool. At 
<A NAME="615"></A>last, utterly terrified by their threats of instant death, the legate himself 
<A NAME="616"></A>charged Hordeonius with treachery. He was then put in irons, and only released 
<A NAME="617"></A>on the arrival of Vocula, who the next day inflicted capital punishment 
<A NAME="618"></A>on the ringleaders of the mutiny; such wide extremes of license and of 
<A NAME="619"></A>subordination were to be found in that army. The common soldiers were undoubtedly 
<A NAME="620"></A>loyal to Vitellius, but all the most distinguished men were in favour of 
<A NAME="621"></A>Vespasian. The result was an alternation of outbreaks and executions, and 
<A NAME="622"></A>a strange mixture of obedience and frenzy, which made it impossible to 
<A NAME="623"></A>restrain the men whom it was yet possible to punish.
<A NAME="624"></A><BR><BR>Meanwhile all Germany was raising the power of Civilis by vast 
<A NAME="625"></A>additions of strength, and the alliance was secured by hostages of the 
<A NAME="626"></A>noblest rank. He directed that the territories of the Ubii and the Treveri 
<A NAME="627"></A>should be ravaged by the several tribes on which they bordered, and that 
<A NAME="628"></A>another detachment should cross the river Mosa, to threaten the Menapii 
<A NAME="629"></A>and the Morini and the frontiers of Gaul. In both quarters plunder was 
<A NAME="630"></A>collected; with peculiar hostility in the case of the Ubii, because, this 
<A NAME="631"></A>nation, being of German origin, had forsworn its native country, and assumed 
<A NAME="632"></A>the Roman name of the Agrippinenses. Their cohorts were cut up at the village 
<A NAME="633"></A>of Marcodurum, where they lay in careless security, presuming on their 
<A NAME="634"></A>distance from the river-bank. The Ubii did not remain quiet, but made predatory 
<A NAME="635"></A>excursions into Germany, escaping at first with impunity, though they were 
<A NAME="636"></A>afterwards cut off. Throughout the whole of this war, they were more loyal 
<A NAME="637"></A>than fortunate. Civilis, grown more formidable now that the Ubii had been 
<A NAME="638"></A>crushed, and elated by the success of his operations, pressed on the siege 
<A NAME="639"></A>of the legions, keeping a strict watch to prevent any secret intelligence 
<A NAME="640"></A>of advancing succours from reaching them. He entrusted to the Batavians 
<A NAME="641"></A>the care of the machines and the vast siege-works, and when the Transrhenane 
<A NAME="642"></A>tribes clamoured for battle, he bade them go and cut through the ramparts, 
<A NAME="643"></A>and, if repulsed, renew the struggle; their numbers were superfluously 
<A NAME="644"></A>large, and their loss was not felt. Even darkness did not terminate the 
<A NAME="645"></A>struggle.
<A NAME="646"></A><BR><BR>Piling up logs of wood round the walls and lighting them, they 
<A NAME="647"></A>sat feasting, and rushed to the conflict, as each grew heated with wine, 
<A NAME="648"></A>with a useless daring. Their missiles were discharged without effect in 
<A NAME="649"></A>the darkness, but to the Romans the ranks of the barbarians were plainly 
<A NAME="650"></A>discernible, and they singled out with deliberate aim anyone whose boldness 
<A NAME="651"></A>or whose decorations made him conspicuous. Civilis saw this, and, extinguishing 
<A NAME="652"></A>the fires, threw the confusion of darkness over the attack. Then ensued 
<A NAME="653"></A>a scene of discordant clamour, of accident, and uncertainty, where no one 
<A NAME="654"></A>could see how to aim or to avoid a blow. Wherever a shout was heard, they 
<A NAME="655"></A>wheeled round and strained hand and foot. Valour was of no avail, accident 
<A NAME="656"></A>disturbed every plan, and the bravest frequently were struck down by the 
<A NAME="657"></A>missiles of the coward. The Germans fought with inconsiderate fury; our 
<A NAME="658"></A>men, more alive to the danger, threw, but not at random, stakes shod with 
<A NAME="659"></A>iron and heavy stones. Where the noise of the assailants was heard, or 
<A NAME="660"></A>where the ladders placed against the walls brought the enemy within reach 
<A NAME="661"></A>of their hands, they pushed them back with their shields, and followed 
<A NAME="662"></A>them with their javelins. Many, who had struggled on to the walls, they 
<A NAME="663"></A>stabbed with their short swords. After a night thus spent, day revealed 
<A NAME="664"></A>a new method of attack.
<A NAME="665"></A><BR><BR>The Batavians had raised a tower two stories high, which they brought 
<A NAME="666"></A>up to the Praetorian gate of the camp, where the ground was most level. 
<A NAME="667"></A>But our men, pushing forward strong poles, and battering it with beams, 
<A NAME="668"></A>broke it down, causing great destruction among the combatants on the top. 
<A NAME="669"></A>The enemy were attacked in their confusion by a sudden and successful sally. 
<A NAME="670"></A>All this time many engines were constructed by the legionaries, who were 
<A NAME="671"></A>superior to the enemy in experience and skill. Peculiar consternation was 
<A NAME="672"></A>caused by a machine, which, being poised in the air over the heads of the 
<A NAME="673"></A>enemy, suddenly descended, and carried up one or more of them past the 
<A NAME="674"></A>faces of their friends, and then, by a shifting of the weights, projected 
<A NAME="675"></A>them within the limits of the camp. Civilis, giving up all hope of a successful 
<A NAME="676"></A>assault, again sat down to blockade the camp at his leisure, and undermined 
<A NAME="677"></A>the fidelity of the legions by the promises of his emissaries.
<A NAME="678"></A><BR><BR>All these events in Germany took place before the battle of Cremona, 
<A NAME="679"></A>the result of which was announced in a despatch from Antonius, accompanied 
<A NAME="680"></A>by Caecina's proclamation. Alpinius Montanus, prefect of a cohort in the 
<A NAME="681"></A>vanquished army, was on the spot, and acknowledged the fate of his party. 
<A NAME="682"></A>Various were the emotions thus excited; the Gallic auxiliaries, who felt 
<A NAME="683"></A>neither affection nor hatred towards either party, and who served without 
<A NAME="684"></A>attachment, at once, at the instance of their prefects, deserted Vitellius. 
<A NAME="685"></A>The veteran soldiers hesitated. Nevertheless, when Hordeonius administered 
<A NAME="686"></A>the oath, under a strong pressure from their tribunes, they pronounced 
<A NAME="687"></A>the words, which their looks and their temper belied, and while they adopted 
<A NAME="688"></A>every other expression, they hesitated at the name of Vespasian, passing 
<A NAME="689"></A>it over with a slight murmur, and not unfrequently in absolute 
<A NAME="690"></A>silence.
<A NAME="691"></A><BR><BR>After this, certain letters from Antonius to Civilis were read 
<A NAME="692"></A>in full assembly, and provoked the suspicions of the soldiery, as they 
<A NAME="693"></A>seemed to be addressed to a partisan of the cause and to be unfriendly 
<A NAME="694"></A>to the army of Germany. Soon the news reached the camp at Gelduba, and 
<A NAME="695"></A>the same language and the same acts were repeated. Montanus was sent with 
<A NAME="696"></A>a message to Civilis, bidding him desist from hostilities, and not seek 
<A NAME="697"></A>to conceal the designs of an enemy by fighting under false colours, and 
<A NAME="698"></A>telling him that, if he had been attempting to assist Vespasian, his purpose 
<A NAME="699"></A>had been fully accomplished. Civilis at first replied in artful language, 
<A NAME="700"></A>but soon perceiving that Montanus was a man of singularly high spirit and 
<A NAME="701"></A>was himself disposed for change, he began with lamenting the perils through 
<A NAME="702"></A>which he had struggled for five-and-twenty years in the camps of Rome. 
<A NAME="703"></A>"It is," he said, "a noble reward that I have received for my toils; my 
<A NAME="704"></A>brother murdered, myself imprisoned, and the savage clamour of this army, 
<A NAME="705"></A>a clamour which demanded my execution, and for which by the law of nations 
<A NAME="706"></A>I demand vengeance. You, Treveri, and other enslaved creatures, what reward 
<A NAME="707"></A>do you expect for the blood which you have shed so often? What but a hateful 
<A NAME="708"></A>service, perpetual tribute, the rod, the axe, and the passions of a ruling 
<A NAME="709"></A>race? See how I, the prefect of a single cohort, with the Batavians and 
<A NAME="710"></A>the Canninefates, a mere fraction of Gaul, have destroyed their vast but 
<A NAME="711"></A>useless camps, or are pressing them with the close blockade of famine and 
<A NAME="712"></A>the sword. In a word, either freedom will follow on our efforts, or, if 
<A NAME="713"></A>we are vanquished, we shall but be what we were before." Having thus fired 
<A NAME="714"></A>the man's ambition, Civilis dismissed him, but bade him carry back a milder 
<A NAME="715"></A>answer. He returned, pretending to have failed in his mission, but not 
<A NAME="716"></A>revealing the other facts; these indeed soon came to 
<A NAME="717"></A>light.
<A NAME="718"></A><BR><BR>Civilis, retaining a part of his forces, sent the veteran cohorts 
<A NAME="719"></A>and the bravest of his German troops against Vocula and his army, under 
<A NAME="720"></A>the command of Julius Maximus and Claudius Victor, his sister's son. On 
<A NAME="721"></A>their march they plundered the winter camp of a body of horse stationed 
<A NAME="722"></A>at Ascibergium, and they fell on Vocula's camp so unexpectedly that he 
<A NAME="723"></A>could neither harangue his army, nor even get it into line. All that he 
<A NAME="724"></A>could do in the confusion was to order the veteran troops to strengthen 
<A NAME="725"></A>the centre. The auxiliaries were dispersed in every part of the field. 
<A NAME="726"></A>The cavalry charged, but, received by the orderly array of the enemy, fled 
<A NAME="727"></A>to their own lines. What ensued was a massacre rather than a battle. The 
<A NAME="728"></A>Nervian infantry, from panic or from treachery, exposed the flank of our 
<A NAME="729"></A>army. Thus the attack fell upon the legions, who had lost their standards 
<A NAME="730"></A>and were being cut down within the entrenchments, when the fortune of the 
<A NAME="731"></A>day was suddenly changed by a reinforcement of fresh troops. Some Vascon 
<A NAME="732"></A>infantry, levied by Galba, which had by this time been sent for, heard 
<A NAME="733"></A>the noise of the combatants as they approached the camp, attacked the rear 
<A NAME="734"></A>of the preoccupied enemy, and spread a panic more than proportionate to 
<A NAME="735"></A>their numbers, some believing that all the troops from Novesium, others 
<A NAME="736"></A>that all from Mogontiacum, had come up. This delusion restored the courage 
<A NAME="737"></A>of the Romans, and in relying on the strength of others they recovered 
<A NAME="738"></A>their own. All the bravest of the Batavians, of the infantry at least, 
<A NAME="739"></A>fell, but the cavalry escaped with the standards and with the prisoners 
<A NAME="740"></A>whom they had secured in the early part of the engagement. Of the slain 
<A NAME="741"></A>on that day the greater number belonged to our army, but to its less effective 
<A NAME="742"></A>part. The Germans lost the flower of their force.
<A NAME="743"></A><BR><BR>The two generals were equally blameworthy; they deserved defeat, 
<A NAME="744"></A>they did not make the most of success. Had Civilis given battle in greater 
<A NAME="745"></A>force, he could not have been outflanked by so small a number of cohorts, 
<A NAME="746"></A>and he might have destroyed the camp after once forcing an entrance. As 
<A NAME="747"></A>for Vocula, he did not reconnoitre the advancing enemy, and consequently 
<A NAME="748"></A>he was vanquished as soon as be left the camp; and then, mistrusting his 
<A NAME="749"></A>victory, he fruitlessly wasted several days before marching against the 
<A NAME="750"></A>enemy, though, had he at once resolved to drive them back, and to follow 
<A NAME="751"></A>up his success, he might, by one and the same movement, have raised the 
<A NAME="752"></A>siege of the legions. Meanwhile Civilis had tried to work on the feelings 
<A NAME="753"></A>of the besieged by representing that with the Romans all was lost, and 
<A NAME="754"></A>that victory had declared for his own troops. The standards and colours 
<A NAME="755"></A>were carried round the ramparts, and the prisoners also were displayed. 
<A NAME="756"></A>One of them, with noble daring, declared the real truth in a loud voice, 
<A NAME="757"></A>and, as he was cut down on the spot by the Germans, all the more confidence 
<A NAME="758"></A>was felt in his information. At the same time it was becoming evident, 
<A NAME="759"></A>from the devastation of the country and from the flames of burning houses, 
<A NAME="760"></A>that the victorious army was approaching. Vocula issued orders that the 
<A NAME="761"></A>standards should be planted within sight of the camp, and should be surrounded 
<A NAME="762"></A>with a ditch and rampart, where his men might deposit their knapsacks, 
<A NAME="763"></A>and so fight without encumbrance. On this, the General was assailed by 
<A NAME="764"></A>a clamorous demand for instant battle. They had now grown used to threaten. 
<A NAME="765"></A>Without even taking time to form into line, disordered and weary as they 
<A NAME="766"></A>were, they commenced the action. Civilis was on the field, trusting quite 
<A NAME="767"></A>as much to the faults of his adversaries as to the valour of his own troops. 
<A NAME="768"></A>With the Romans the fortune of the day varied, and the most violently mutinous 
<A NAME="769"></A>shewed themselves cowards. But some, remembering their recent victory, 
<A NAME="770"></A>stood their ground and struck fiercely at the foe, now encouraging each 
<A NAME="771"></A>other and their neighbours, and now, while they re-formed their lines, 
<A NAME="772"></A>imploring the besieged not to lose the opportunity. These latter, who saw 
<A NAME="773"></A>everything from the walls, sallied out from every gate. It so happened 
<A NAME="774"></A>that Civilis was thrown to the ground by the fall of his horse. A report 
<A NAME="775"></A>that he had been either wounded or slain gained belief throughout both 
<A NAME="776"></A>armies, and spread incredible panic among his own troops, and gave as great 
<A NAME="777"></A>encouragement to their opponents. But Vocula, leaving the flying foe, began 
<A NAME="778"></A>to strengthen the rampart and the towers of the camp, as if another siege 
<A NAME="779"></A>were imminent. He had misused success so often that he was rightly suspected 
<A NAME="780"></A>of a preference for war.
<A NAME="781"></A><BR><BR>Nothing distressed our troops so much as the scarcity of supplies. 
<A NAME="782"></A>The baggage of the legions was therefore sent to Novesium with a crowd 
<A NAME="783"></A>of non-combatants to fetch corn from that place overland, for the enemy 
<A NAME="784"></A>commanded the river. The march of the first body was accomplished in security, 
<A NAME="785"></A>as Civilis had not yet recovered. But when he heard that officers of the 
<A NAME="786"></A>commissariat had been again sent to Novesium, and that the infantry detached 
<A NAME="787"></A>as an escort were advancing just as if it were a time of profound peace, 
<A NAME="788"></A>with but few soldiers round the standards, the arms stowed away in the 
<A NAME="789"></A>wagons, and all wandering about at their pleasure, he attacked them in 
<A NAME="790"></A>regular form, having first sent on troops to occupy the bridges and the 
<A NAME="791"></A>defiles in the road. The battle extended over a long line of march, lasting 
<A NAME="792"></A>with varying success till night parted the combatants. The infantry pushed 
<A NAME="793"></A>on to Gelduba, while the camp remained in the same state as before, garrisoned 
<A NAME="794"></A>by such troops as had been left in it. There could be no doubt what peril 
<A NAME="795"></A>a convoy, heavily laden and panic-stricken, would have to encounter in 
<A NAME="796"></A>attempting to return. Vocula added to his force a thousand picked men from 
<A NAME="797"></A>the fifth and fifteenth legions besieged in the Old Camp, a body of troops 
<A NAME="798"></A>undisciplined and ill-affected to their officers. But more than the number 
<A NAME="799"></A>specified came forward, and openly protested, as they marched, that they 
<A NAME="800"></A>would not endure any longer the hardships of famine and the treachery of 
<A NAME="801"></A>the legates. On the other hand, those who had stayed behind complained 
<A NAME="802"></A>that they were, being left to their fate by this withdrawal of a part of 
<A NAME="803"></A>the legions. A twofold mutiny was the result, some calling upon Vocula 
<A NAME="804"></A>to come back, while the others refused to return to the 
<A NAME="805"></A>camp.
<A NAME="806"></A><BR><BR>Meanwhile Civilis blockaded the Old Camp. Vocula retired first 
<A NAME="807"></A>to Gelduba, after, wards to Novesium; Civilis took possession of Gelduba, 
<A NAME="808"></A>and not long after was victorious in a cavalry engagement near Novesium. 
<A NAME="809"></A>But reverses and successes seemed equally to kindle in the troops the one 
<A NAME="810"></A>desire of murdering their officers. The legions, increased in number by 
<A NAME="811"></A>the arrival of the men from the fifth and fifteenth, demanded a donative, 
<A NAME="812"></A>for they had discovered that some money had been sent by Vitellius. After 
<A NAME="813"></A>a short delay Hordeonius gave the donative in the name of Vespasian. This, 
<A NAME="814"></A>more than anything else, fostered the mutinous spirit. The men, abandoning 
<A NAME="815"></A>themselves to debauchery and revelry and all the license of nightly gatherings, 
<A NAME="816"></A>revived their old grudge against Hordeonius. Without a single legate or 
<A NAME="817"></A>tribune venturing to check them, for the darkness seems to have taken from 
<A NAME="818"></A>them all sense of shame, they dragged him out of his bed and killed him. 
<A NAME="819"></A>The same fate was intended for Vocula, but he assumed the dress of a slave, 
<A NAME="820"></A>and escaped unrecognized in the darkness. When their fury had subsided 
<A NAME="821"></A>and their alarm returned, they sent centurions with despatches to the various 
<A NAME="822"></A>states of Gaul, imploring help in money and troops.
<A NAME="823"></A><BR><BR>These men, headstrong, cowardly, and spiritless, as a mob without 
<A NAME="824"></A>a leader always is, on the approach of Civilis hastily took up arms, and, 
<A NAME="825"></A>as hastily abandoning them, betook themselves to flight. Disaster produced 
<A NAME="826"></A>disunion, the troops from the Upper army dissociating their cause from 
<A NAME="827"></A>that of their comrades. Nevertheless the statues of Vitellius were again 
<A NAME="828"></A>set up in the camp and in the neighbouring Belgian towns, and this at a 
<A NAME="829"></A>time when Vitellius himself had fallen. Then the men of the 1st, the 4th, 
<A NAME="830"></A>and the 18th legions, repenting of their conduct, followed Vocula, and 
<A NAME="831"></A>again taking in his presence the oath of allegiance to Vespasian, were 
<A NAME="832"></A>marched by him to the relief of Mogontiacum. The besieging army, an heterogeneous 
<A NAME="833"></A>mass of Chatti, Usipii, and Mattiaci, had raised the siege, glutted with 
<A NAME="834"></A>spoils, but not without suffering loss. Our troops attacked them on the 
<A NAME="835"></A>way, dispersed and unprepared. Moreover the Treveri had constructed a breastwork 
<A NAME="836"></A>and rampart across their territory, and they and the Germans continued 
<A NAME="837"></A>to contend with great losses on both sides up to the time when they tarnished 
<A NAME="838"></A>by rebellion their distinguished services to the Roman 
<A NAME="839"></A>people.
<A NAME="840"></A><BR><BR>Meanwhile Vespasian (now consul for the second time) and Titus 
<A NAME="841"></A>entered upon their office, both being absent from Rome. People were gloomy 
<A NAME="842"></A>and anxious under the pressure of manifold fears, for, over and above immediate 
<A NAME="843"></A>perils, they had taken groundless alarm under the impression that Africa 
<A NAME="844"></A>was in rebellion through the revolutionary movements of Lucius Piso. He 
<A NAME="845"></A>was governor of that province, and was far from being a man of turbulent 
<A NAME="846"></A>disposition. The fact was that the wheat-ships were detained by the severity 
<A NAME="847"></A>of the weather, and the lower orders, who were accustomed to buy their 
<A NAME="848"></A>provisions from day to day, and to whom cheap corn was the sole subject 
<A NAME="849"></A>of public interest, feared and believed that the ports had been closed 
<A NAME="850"></A>and the supplies stopped, the Vitellianists, who had not yet given up their 
<A NAME="851"></A>party feelings, helping to spread the report, which was not displeasing 
<A NAME="852"></A>even to the conquerors. Their ambition, which even foreign campaigns could 
<A NAME="853"></A>not fill to the full, was not satisfied by any triumphs that civil war 
<A NAME="854"></A>could furnish.
<A NAME="855"></A><BR><BR>On the 1st of January, at a meeting of the Senate, convoked for 
<A NAME="856"></A>the purpose by Julius Frontinus, praetor of the city, votes of thanks were 
<A NAME="857"></A>passed to the legates, to the armies, and to the allied kings. The office 
<A NAME="858"></A>of praetor was taken away from Tettius Julianus, as having deserted his 
<A NAME="859"></A>legion when it passed over to the party of Vespasian, with a view to its 
<A NAME="860"></A>being transferred to Plotius Griphus. Equestrian rank was conferred on 
<A NAME="861"></A>Hormus. Then, on the resignation of Frontinus, Caesar Domitian assumed 
<A NAME="862"></A>the office of praetor of the city. His name was put at the head of despatches 
<A NAME="863"></A>and edicts, but the real authority was in the hands of Mucianus, with this 
<A NAME="864"></A>exception, that Domitian ventured on several acts of power, at the instigation 
<A NAME="865"></A>of his friends, or at his own caprice. But Mucianus found his principal 
<A NAME="866"></A>cause of apprehension in Primus Antonius and Varus Arrius, who, in the 
<A NAME="867"></A>freshness of their fame, while distinguished by great achievements and 
<A NAME="868"></A>by the attachment of the soldiery, were also supported by the people, because 
<A NAME="869"></A>in no case had they extended their severities beyond the battle-field. 
<A NAME="870"></A>It was also reported that Antonius had urged Scribonianus Crassus, whom 
<A NAME="871"></A>an illustrious descent added to the honours of his brother made a conspicuous 
<A NAME="872"></A>person, to assume the supreme power; and it was understood that a number 
<A NAME="873"></A>of accomplices would not have failed to support him, had not the proposal 
<A NAME="874"></A>been rejected by Scribonianus, who was a man not easily to be tempted even 
<A NAME="875"></A>by a certainty, and was proportionately apprehensive of risk. Mucianus, 
<A NAME="876"></A>seeing that Antonius could not be openly crushed, heaped many praises upon 
<A NAME="877"></A>him in the Senate, and loaded him with promises in secret, holding out 
<A NAME="878"></A>as a prize the government of Eastern Spain, then vacant in consequence 
<A NAME="879"></A>of the departure of Cluvius Rufus. At the same time he lavished on his 
<A NAME="880"></A>friends tribuneships and prefectures; and then, when he had filled the 
<A NAME="881"></A>vain heart of the man with hope and ambition, he destroyed his power by 
<A NAME="882"></A>sending into winter quarters the 7th legion, whose affection for Antonius 
<A NAME="883"></A>was particularly vehement. The 3rd legion, old troops of Varus Arrius, 
<A NAME="884"></A>were sent back to Syria. Part of the army was on its way to Germany. Thus 
<A NAME="885"></A>all elements of disturbance being removed, the usual appearance of the 
<A NAME="886"></A>capital, the laws, and the jurisdiction of the magistrates, were once more 
<A NAME="887"></A>restored.
<A NAME="888"></A><BR><BR>Domitian, on the day of his taking his seat in the Senate, made 
<A NAME="889"></A>a brief and measured speech in reference to the absence of his father and 
<A NAME="890"></A>brother, and to his own youth. He was graceful in his bearing, and, his 
<A NAME="891"></A>real character being yet unknown, the frequent blush on his countenance 
<A NAME="892"></A>passed for modesty. On his proposing the restoration of the Imperial honours 
<A NAME="893"></A>of Galba, Curtius Montanus moved that respect should also be paid to the 
<A NAME="894"></A>memory of Piso. The Senate passed both motions, but that which referred 
<A NAME="895"></A>to Piso was not carried out. Certain commissioners were then appointed 
<A NAME="896"></A>by lot, who were to see to the restitution of property plundered during 
<A NAME="897"></A>the war, to examine and restore to their place the brazen tables of the 
<A NAME="898"></A>laws, which had fallen down through age, to free the Calendar from the 
<A NAME="899"></A>additions with which the adulatory spirit of the time had disfigured it, 
<A NAME="900"></A>and to put a check on the public expenditure. The office of praetor was 
<A NAME="901"></A>restored to Tettius Julianus, as soon as it was known that he had fled 
<A NAME="902"></A>for refuge to Vespasian. Griphus still retained his rank. It was then determined 
<A NAME="903"></A>that the cause of Musonius Rufus against Publius Celer should be again 
<A NAME="904"></A>brought on. Publius was condemned, and thus expiation was made to the shade 
<A NAME="905"></A>of Soranus. The day thus marked by an example of public justice was not 
<A NAME="906"></A>barren of distinction to individuals. Musonius was thought to have fulfilled 
<A NAME="907"></A>the righteous duty of an accuser, but men spoke very differently of Demetrius, 
<A NAME="908"></A>a disciple of the Cynical school of philosophy, who pleaded the cause of 
<A NAME="909"></A>a notorious criminal by appeals to corrupt influences rather than by fair 
<A NAME="910"></A>argument. Publius himself, in his peril, had neither spirit nor power of 
<A NAME="911"></A>speech left. The signal for vengeance on the informers having been thus 
<A NAME="912"></A>given, Junius Mauricus asked Caesar to give the Senate access to the Imperial 
<A NAME="913"></A>registers, from which they might learn what impeachments the several informers 
<A NAME="914"></A>had proposed. Caesar answered, that in a matter of such importance the 
<A NAME="915"></A>Emperor must be consulted.
<A NAME="916"></A><BR><BR>The Senate, led by its principal members, then framed a form of 
<A NAME="917"></A>oath, which was eagerly taken by all the magistrates and by the other Senators 
<A NAME="918"></A>in the order in which they voted. They called the Gods to witness, that 
<A NAME="919"></A>nothing had been done by their instrumentality to prejudice the safety 
<A NAME="920"></A>of any person, and that they had gained no distinction or advantage by 
<A NAME="921"></A>the ruin of Roman citizens. Great was the alarm, and various the devices 
<A NAME="922"></A>for altering the words of the oath, among those who felt the consciousness 
<A NAME="923"></A>of guilt. The Senate appreciated the scruple, but denounced the perjury. 
<A NAME="924"></A>This public censure, as it might be called, fell with especial severity 
<A NAME="925"></A>on three men, Sariolenus Vocula, Nonnius Attianus, and Cestius Severus, 
<A NAME="926"></A>all of them infamous for having practised the trade of the informer in 
<A NAME="927"></A>the days of Nero. Sariolenus indeed laboured under an imputation of recent 
<A NAME="928"></A>date. It was said that he had attempted the same practices during the reign 
<A NAME="929"></A>of Vitellius. The Senators did not desist from threatening gestures, till 
<A NAME="930"></A>he quitted the chamber; then passing to Paccius Africanus, they assailed 
<A NAME="931"></A>him in the same way. It was he, they said, who had singled out as victims 
<A NAME="932"></A>for Nero the brothers Scribonius, renowned for their mutual affection and 
<A NAME="933"></A>for their wealth. Africanus dared not confess his guilt, and could not 
<A NAME="934"></A>deny it; but he himself turned on Vibius Crispus, who was pressing him 
<A NAME="935"></A>with questions, and complicating a charge which he could not rebut, shifted 
<A NAME="936"></A>the blame from himself by associating another with his 
<A NAME="937"></A>guilt.
<A NAME="938"></A><BR><BR>Great was the reputation for brotherly affection, as well as for 
<A NAME="939"></A>eloquence, which Vipstanus Messalla earned for himself on that day, by 
<A NAME="940"></A>venturing, though not yet of Senatorial age, to plead for his brother Aquilius 
<A NAME="941"></A>Regulus. The fall of the families of the Crassi and Orfitus had brought 
<A NAME="942"></A>Regulus into the utmost odium. Of his own free will, as it seemed, and 
<A NAME="943"></A>while still a mere youth, he had undertaken the prosecution, not to ward 
<A NAME="944"></A>off any peril from himself, but in the hope of gaining power. The wife 
<A NAME="945"></A>of Crassus, Sulpicia Praetextata, and her four children were ready, should 
<A NAME="946"></A>the Senate take cognizance of the cause, to demand vengeance. Accordingly, 
<A NAME="947"></A>Messalla, without attempting to defend the case or the person accused, 
<A NAME="948"></A>had simply thrown himself in the way of the perils that threatened his 
<A NAME="949"></A>brother, and had thus wrought upon the feelings of several Senators. On 
<A NAME="950"></A>this Curtius Montanus met him with a fierce speech, in which he went to 
<A NAME="951"></A>the length of asserting, that after the death of Galba, money had been 
<A NAME="952"></A>given by Regulus to the murderer of Piso, and that he had even fastened 
<A NAME="953"></A>his teeth in the murdered man's head. "Certainly," he said, "Nero did not 
<A NAME="954"></A>compel this act; you did not secure by this piece of barbarity either your 
<A NAME="955"></A>rank or your life. We may bear with the defence put forward by men who 
<A NAME="956"></A>thought it better to destroy others than to come into peril themselves. 
<A NAME="957"></A>As for you, the exile of your father, and the division of his property 
<A NAME="958"></A>among his creditors, had left you perfectly safe, besides that your youth 
<A NAME="959"></A>incapacitated you for office; there was nothing in you which Nero could 
<A NAME="960"></A>either covet or dread. It was from sheer lust of slaughter and greed of 
<A NAME="961"></A>gain that you, unknown as you were, you, who had never pleaded in any man's 
<A NAME="962"></A>defence, steeped your soul in noble blood, when, though you had snatched 
<A NAME="963"></A>from the very grave of your Country the spoils of a man of consular rank, 
<A NAME="964"></A>had been fed to the full with seven million sesterces, and shone with all 
<A NAME="965"></A>sacerdotal honours, you yet overwhelmed in one common ruin innocent boys, 
<A NAME="966"></A>old men of illustrious name, and noble ladies, when you actually blamed 
<A NAME="967"></A>the tardy movements of Nero in wearying himself and his informers with 
<A NAME="968"></A>the overthrow of single families, and declared that the whole Senate might 
<A NAME="969"></A>be destroyed by one word. Keep, Conscript Fathers, preserve a man of such 
<A NAME="970"></A>ready counsels, that every age may be furnished with its teacher, and that 
<A NAME="971"></A>our young men may imitate Regulus, just as our old men imitate Marcellus 
<A NAME="972"></A>and Crispus. Even unsuccessful villany finds some to emulate it: what will 
<A NAME="973"></A>happen, if it flourish and be strong? And the man, whom we dare not offend 
<A NAME="974"></A>when he holds only quaestor's rank, are we to see him rise to the dignities 
<A NAME="975"></A>of praetor and consul? Do you suppose that Nero will be the last of the 
<A NAME="976"></A>tyrants? Those who survived Tiberius, those who survived Caligula, thought 
<A NAME="977"></A>the same; and yet after each there arose another ruler yet more detestable 
<A NAME="978"></A>and more cruel. We are not afraid of Vespasian; the age and moderation 
<A NAME="979"></A>of the new Emperor reassure us. But the influence of an example outlives 
<A NAME="980"></A>the individual character. We have lost our vigour, Conscript Fathers; we 
<A NAME="981"></A>are no longer that Senate, which, when Nero had fallen, demanded that the 
<A NAME="982"></A>informers and ministers of the tyrant should be punished according to ancient 
<A NAME="983"></A>custom. The first day after the downfall of a wicked Emperor is the best 
<A NAME="984"></A>of opportunities."
<A NAME="985"></A><BR><BR>Montanus was heard with such approval on the part of the Senate, 
<A NAME="986"></A>that Helvidius conceived a hope that Marcellus also might be overthrown. 
<A NAME="987"></A>He therefore began with a panegyric on Cluvius Rufus, who, though not less 
<A NAME="988"></A>rich nor less renowned for eloquence, had never imperilled a single life 
<A NAME="989"></A>in the days of Nero. By this comparison, as well as by direct accusations, 
<A NAME="990"></A>he pressed Eprius hard, and stirred the indignation of the Senators. When 
<A NAME="991"></A>Marcellus perceived this, he made as if he would leave the House, exclaiming, 
<A NAME="992"></A>"We go, Priscus, and leave you your Senate; act the king, though Caesar 
<A NAME="993"></A>himself be present." Crispus followed. Both were enraged, but their looks 
<A NAME="994"></A>were different; Marcellus cast furious glances about him, while Crispus 
<A NAME="995"></A>smiled. They were drawn back, however, into the Senate by the hasty interference 
<A NAME="996"></A>of friends. The contest grew fiercer, while the well-disposed majority 
<A NAME="997"></A>on the one side, and a powerful minority on the other, fought out their 
<A NAME="998"></A>obstinate quarrel, and thus the day was spent in altercation.
<A NAME="999"></A><BR><BR>At the next meeting of the Senate Caesar began by recommending 
<A NAME="1000"></A>that the wrongs, the resentments, and the terrible necessities of former 
<A NAME="1001"></A>times, should be forgotten, and Mucianus spoke at great length in favour 
<A NAME="1002"></A>of the informers. At the same time he admonished in gentle terms and in 
<A NAME="1003"></A>a tone of entreaty those who were reviving indictments, which they had 
<A NAME="1004"></A>before commenced and afterwards dropped. The Senators, when they found 
<A NAME="1005"></A>themselves opposed, relinquished the liberty which they had begun to exercise. 
<A NAME="1006"></A>That it might not be thought that the opinion of the Senate was disregarded, 
<A NAME="1007"></A>or that impunity was accorded to all acts done in the days of Nero, Mucianus 
<A NAME="1008"></A>sent back to their islands two men of Senatorial rank, Octavius Sagitta 
<A NAME="1009"></A>and Antistius Sosianus, who had quitted their places of banishment. Octavius 
<A NAME="1010"></A>had seduced one Pontia Postumia, and, on her refusing to marry him, in 
<A NAME="1011"></A>the frenzy of passion had murdered her. Sosianus by his depravity had brought 
<A NAME="1012"></A>many to ruin. Both had been condemned and banished by a solemn decision 
<A NAME="1013"></A>of the Senate, and, though others were permitted to return, were kept under 
<A NAME="1014"></A>the same penalty. But this did not mitigate the hatred felt against Mucianus. 
<A NAME="1015"></A>Sosianus and Sagitta were utterly insignificant, even if they did return; 
<A NAME="1016"></A>but men dreaded the abilities of the informers, their wealth, and the power 
<A NAME="1017"></A>which they exercised in many sinister ways.
<A NAME="1018"></A><BR><BR>A trial, conducted in the Senate according to ancient precedents, 
<A NAME="1019"></A>brought into harmony for a time the feelings of its members. Manlius Patruitus, 
<A NAME="1020"></A>a Senator, laid a complaint, that he had been beaten by a mob in the colony 
<A NAME="1021"></A>of Sena, and that by order of the magistrates; that the wrong had not stopped 
<A NAME="1022"></A>here, but that lamentations and wailings, in fact a representation of funeral 
<A NAME="1023"></A>obsequies, had been enacted in his presence, accompanied with contemptuous 
<A NAME="1024"></A>and insulting expressions levelled against the whole Senate. The persons 
<A NAME="1025"></A>accused were summoned to appear, and after the case had been investigated, 
<A NAME="1026"></A>punishment was inflicted on those who were found guilty. A resolution of 
<A NAME="1027"></A>the Senate was also passed, recommending more orderly behaviour to the 
<A NAME="1028"></A>people of Sena. About the same time Antonius Flamma was condemned under 
<A NAME="1029"></A>the law against extortion, at the suit of the people of Cyrene, and was 
<A NAME="1030"></A>banished for cruel practices.
<A NAME="1031"></A><BR><BR>Amidst all this a mutiny in the army all but broke out. The troops 
<A NAME="1032"></A>who, having been disbanded by Vitellius, had flocked to support Vespasian, 
<A NAME="1033"></A>asked leave to serve again in the Praetorian Guard, and the soldiers who 
<A NAME="1034"></A>had been selected from the legions with the same prospect now clamoured 
<A NAME="1035"></A>for their promised pay. Even the Vitellianists could not be got rid of 
<A NAME="1036"></A>without much bloodshed. But the money required for retaining in the service 
<A NAME="1037"></A>so vast a body of men was immensely large. Mucianus entered the camp to 
<A NAME="1038"></A>examine more accurately the individual claims. The victorious army, wearing 
<A NAME="1039"></A>their proper decorations and arms, he drew up with moderate intervals of 
<A NAME="1040"></A>space between the divisions; then the Vitellianists, whose capitulation 
<A NAME="1041"></A>at Bovillae I have already related, and the other troops of the party, 
<A NAME="1042"></A>who had been collected from the capital and its neighbourhood, were brought 
<A NAME="1043"></A>forth almost naked. Mucianus ordered these men to be drawn up apart, making 
<A NAME="1044"></A>the British, the German, and any other troops that there were belonging 
<A NAME="1045"></A>to other armies, take up separate positions. The very first view of their 
<A NAME="1046"></A>situation paralyzed them. They saw opposed to them what seemed a hostile 
<A NAME="1047"></A>array, threatening them with javelin and sword. They saw themselves hemmed 
<A NAME="1048"></A>in, without arms, filthy and squalid. And when they began to be separated, 
<A NAME="1049"></A>some to be marched to one spot, and some to another, a thrill of terror 
<A NAME="1050"></A>ran through them all. Among the troops from Germany the panic was particularly 
<A NAME="1051"></A>great; for they believed that this separation marked them out for slaughter. 
<A NAME="1052"></A>They embraced their fellow soldiers, clung to their necks, begged for parting 
<A NAME="1053"></A>kisses, and entreated that they might not be deserted, or doomed in a common 
<A NAME="1054"></A>cause to suffer a different lot. They invoked now Mucianus, now the absent 
<A NAME="1055"></A>Emperor, and, as a last resource, heaven and the Gods, till Mucianus came 
<A NAME="1056"></A>forward, and calling them "soldiers bound by the same oath and servants 
<A NAME="1057"></A>of the same Emperor," stopped the groundless panic. And indeed the victorious 
<A NAME="1058"></A>army seconded the tears of the vanquished with their approving shouts. 
<A NAME="1059"></A>This terminated the proceedings for that day. But when Domitian harangued 
<A NAME="1060"></A>them a few days afterwards, they received him with increased confidence. 
<A NAME="1061"></A>The land that was offered them they contemptuously rejected, and begged 
<A NAME="1062"></A>for regular service and pay. Theirs were prayers indeed, but such as it 
<A NAME="1063"></A>was impossible to reject. They were therefore received into the Praetorian 
<A NAME="1064"></A>camp. Then such as had reached the prescribed age, or had served the proper 
<A NAME="1065"></A>number of campaigns, received an honourable discharge; others were dismissed 
<A NAME="1066"></A>for misconduct; but this was done by degrees and in detail, always the 
<A NAME="1067"></A>safest mode of reducing the united strength of a multitude.
<A NAME="1068"></A><BR><BR>It is a fact that, whether suggested by real poverty or by a wish 
<A NAME="1069"></A>to give the appearance of it, a proposition passed the Senate to the effect 
<A NAME="1070"></A>that a loan of sixty million sesterces from private persons should be accepted. 
<A NAME="1071">
