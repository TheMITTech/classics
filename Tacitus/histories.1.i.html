<A NAME="start"></A>
<A NAME="10"></A>January - March, A.D. 69
<A NAME="11"></A><BR><BR>I begin my work with the time when Servius Galba was consul for 
<A NAME="12"></A>the second time with Titus Vinius for his colleague. Of the former period, 
<A NAME="13"></A>the 820 years dating from the founding of the city, many authors have treated; 
<A NAME="14"></A>and while they had to record the transactions of the Roman people, they 
<A NAME="15"></A>wrote with equal eloquence and freedom. After the conflict at Actium, and 
<A NAME="16"></A>when it became essential to peace, that all power should be centered in 
<A NAME="17"></A>one man, these great intellects passed away. Then too the truthfulness 
<A NAME="18"></A>of history was impaired in many ways; at first, through men's ignorance 
<A NAME="19"></A>of public affairs, which were now wholly strange to them, then, through 
<A NAME="20"></A>their passion for flattery, or, on the other hand, their hatred of their 
<A NAME="21"></A>masters. And so between the enmity of the one and the servility of the 
<A NAME="22"></A>other, neither had any regard for posterity. But while we instinctively 
<A NAME="23"></A>shrink from a writer's adulation, we lend a ready ear to detraction and 
<A NAME="24"></A>spite, because flattery involves the shameful imputation of servility, 
<A NAME="25"></A>whereas malignity wears the false appearance of honesty. I myself knew 
<A NAME="26"></A>nothing of Galba, of Otho, or of Vitellius, either from benefits or from 
<A NAME="27"></A>injuries. I would not deny that my elevation was begun by Vespasian, augmented 
<A NAME="28"></A>by Titus, and still further advanced by Domitian; but those who profess 
<A NAME="29"></A>inviolable truthfulness must speak of all without partiality and without 
<A NAME="30"></A>hatred. I have reserved as an employment for my old age, should my life 
<A NAME="31"></A>be long enough, a subject at once more fruitful and less anxious in the 
<A NAME="32"></A>reign of the Divine Nerva and the empire of Trajan, enjoying the rare happiness 
<A NAME="33"></A>of times, when we may think what we please, and express what we 
<A NAME="34"></A>think.
<A NAME="35"></A><BR><BR>I am entering on the history of a period rich in disasters, frightful 
<A NAME="36"></A>in its wars, torn by civil strife, and even in peace full of horrors. Four 
<A NAME="37"></A>emperors perished by the sword. There were three civil wars; there were 
<A NAME="38"></A>more with foreign enemies; there were often wars that had both characters 
<A NAME="39"></A>at once. There was success in the East, and disaster in the West. There 
<A NAME="40"></A>were disturbances in Illyricum; Gaul wavered in its allegiance; Britain 
<A NAME="41"></A>was thoroughly subdued and immediately abandoned; the tribes of the Suevi 
<A NAME="42"></A>and the Sarmatae rose in concert against us; the Dacians had the glory 
<A NAME="43"></A>of inflicting as well as suffering defeat; the armies of Parthia were all 
<A NAME="44"></A>but set in motion by the cheat of a counterfeit Nero. Now too Italy was 
<A NAME="45"></A>prostrated by disasters either entirely novel, or that recurred only after 
<A NAME="46"></A>a long succession of ages; cities in Campania's richest plains were swallowed 
<A NAME="47"></A>up and overwhelmed; Rome was wasted by conflagrations, its oldest temples 
<A NAME="48"></A>consumed, and the Capitol itself fired by the hands of citizens. Sacred 
<A NAME="49"></A>rites were profaned; there was profligacy in the highest ranks; the sea 
<A NAME="50"></A>was crowded with exiles, and its rocks polluted with bloody deeds. In the 
<A NAME="51"></A>capital there were yet worse horrors. Nobility, wealth, the refusal or 
<A NAME="52"></A>the acceptance of office, were grounds for accusation, and virtue ensured 
<A NAME="53"></A>destruction. The rewards of the informers were no less odious than their 
<A NAME="54"></A>crimes; for while some seized on consulships and priestly offices, as their 
<A NAME="55"></A>share of the spoil, others on procuratorships, and posts of more confidential 
<A NAME="56"></A>authority, they robbed and ruined in every direction amid universal hatred 
<A NAME="57"></A>and terror. Slaves were bribed to turn against their masters, and freedmen 
<A NAME="58"></A>to betray their patrons; and those who had not an enemy were destroyed 
<A NAME="59"></A>by friends.
<A NAME="60"></A><BR><BR>Yet the age was not so barren in noble qualities, as not also to 
<A NAME="61"></A>exhibit examples of virtue. Mothers accompanied the flight of their sons; 
<A NAME="62"></A>wives followed their husbands into exile; there were brave kinsmen and 
<A NAME="63"></A>faithful sons in law; there were slaves whose fidelity defied even torture; 
<A NAME="64"></A>there were illustrious men driven to the last necessity, and enduring it 
<A NAME="65"></A>with fortitude; there were closing scenes that equalled the famous deaths 
<A NAME="66"></A>of antiquity. Besides the manifold vicissitudes of human affairs, there 
<A NAME="67"></A>were prodigies in heaven and earth, the warning voices of the thunder, 
<A NAME="68"></A>and other intimations of the future, auspicious or gloomy, doubtful or 
<A NAME="69"></A>not to be mistaken. Never surely did more terrible calamities of the Roman 
<A NAME="70"></A>People, or evidence more conclusive, prove that the Gods take no thought 
<A NAME="71"></A>for our happiness, but only for our punishment.
<A NAME="72"></A><BR><BR>I think it proper, however, before I commence my purposed work, 
<A NAME="73"></A>to pass under review the condition of the capital, the temper of the armies, 
<A NAME="74"></A>the attitude of the provinces, and the elements of weakness and strength 
<A NAME="75"></A>which existed throughout the whole empire, that so we may become acquainted, 
<A NAME="76"></A>not only with the vicissitudes and the issues of events, which are often 
<A NAME="77"></A>matters of chance, but also with their relations and their causes. Welcome 
<A NAME="78"></A>as the death of Nero had been in the first burst of joy, yet it had not 
<A NAME="79"></A>only roused various emotions in Rome, among the Senators, the people, or 
<A NAME="80"></A>the soldiery of the capital, it had also excited all the legions and their 
<A NAME="81"></A>generals; for now had been divulged that secret of the empire, that emperors 
<A NAME="82"></A>could be made elsewhere than at Rome. The Senators enjoyed the first exercise 
<A NAME="83"></A>of freedom with the less restraint, because the Emperor was new to power, 
<A NAME="84"></A>and absent from the capital. The leading men of the Equestrian order sympathised 
<A NAME="85"></A>most closely with the joy of the Senators. The respectable portion of the 
<A NAME="86"></A>people, which was connected with the great families, as well as the dependants 
<A NAME="87"></A>and freedmen of condemned and banished persons, were high in hope. The 
<A NAME="88"></A>degraded populace, frequenters of the arena and the theatre, the most worthless 
<A NAME="89"></A>of the slaves, and those who having wasted their property were supported 
<A NAME="90"></A>by the infamous excesses of Nero, caught eagerly in their dejection at 
<A NAME="91"></A>every rumour.
<A NAME="92"></A><BR><BR>The soldiery of the capital, who were imbued with the spirit of 
<A NAME="93"></A>an old allegiance to the Caesars, and who had been led to desert Nero by 
<A NAME="94"></A>intrigues and influences from without rather than by their own feelings, 
<A NAME="95"></A>were inclined for change, when they found that the donative promised in 
<A NAME="96"></A>Galba's name was withheld, and reflected that for great services and great 
<A NAME="97"></A>rewards there was not the same room in peace as in war, and that the favour 
<A NAME="98"></A>of an emperor created by the legions must be already preoccupied. They 
<A NAME="99"></A>were further excited by the treason of Nymphidius Sabinus, their prefect, 
<A NAME="100"></A>who himself aimed at the throne. Nymphidius indeed perished in the attempt, 
<A NAME="101"></A>but, though the head of the mutiny was thus removed, there yet remained 
<A NAME="102"></A>in many of the soldiers the consciousness of guilt. There were even men 
<A NAME="103"></A>who talked in angry terms of the feebleness and avarice of Galba. The strictness 
<A NAME="104"></A>once so commended, and celebrated in the praises of the army, was galling 
<A NAME="105"></A>to troops who rebelled against the old discipline, and who had been accustomed 
<A NAME="106"></A>by fourteen years' service under Nero to love the vices of their emperors, 
<A NAME="107"></A>as much as they had once respected their virtues. To all this was added 
<A NAME="108"></A>Galba's own expression, "I choose my soldiers, I do not buy them," noble 
<A NAME="109"></A>words for the commonwealth, but fraught with peril for himself. His other 
<A NAME="110"></A>acts were not after this pattern.
<A NAME="111"></A><BR><BR>Titus Vinius and Cornelius Laco, one the most worthless, the other 
<A NAME="112"></A>the most spiritless of mankind, were ruining the weak old Emperor, who 
<A NAME="113"></A>had to bear the odium of such crimes and the scorn felt for such cowardice. 
<A NAME="114"></A>Galba's progress had been slow and blood-stained. Cingonius Varro, consul 
<A NAME="115"></A>elect, and Petronius Turpilianus, a man of consular rank, were put to death; 
<A NAME="116"></A>the former as an accomplice of Nymphidius, the latter as one of Nero's 
<A NAME="117"></A>generals. Both had perished without hearing or defence, like innocent men. 
<A NAME="118"></A>His entry into the capital, made after the slaughter of thousands of unarmed 
<A NAME="119"></A>soldiers, was most ill-omened, and was terrible even to the executioners. 
<A NAME="120"></A>As he brought into the city his Spanish legion, while that which Nero had 
<A NAME="121"></A>levied from the fleet still remained, Rome was full of strange troops. 
<A NAME="122"></A>There were also many detachments from Germany, Britain, and Illyria, selected 
<A NAME="123"></A>by Nero, and sent on by him to the Caspian passes, for service in the expedition 
<A NAME="124"></A>which he was preparing against the Albani, but afterwards recalled to crush 
<A NAME="125"></A>the insurrection of Vindex. Here there were vast materials for a revolution, 
<A NAME="126"></A>without indeed a decided bias towards any one man, but ready to a daring 
<A NAME="127"></A>hand.
<A NAME="128"></A><BR><BR>In this conjuncture it happened that tidings of the deaths of Fonteius 
<A NAME="129"></A>Capito and Clodius Macer reached the capital. Macer was executed in Africa, 
<A NAME="130"></A>where he was undoubtedly fomenting sedition, by Trebonius Garutianus the 
<A NAME="131"></A>procurator, who acted on Galba's authority; Capito fell in Germany, while 
<A NAME="132"></A>he was making similar attempts, by the hands of Cornelius Aquinus and Fabius 
<A NAME="133"></A>Valens, legates of legions, who did not wait for an order. There were however 
<A NAME="134"></A>some who believed that Capito, though foully stained with avarice and profligacy, 
<A NAME="135"></A>had yet abstained from all thought of revolution, that this was a treacherous 
<A NAME="136"></A>accusation invented by the commanders themselves, who had urged him to 
<A NAME="137"></A>take up arms, when they found themselves unable to prevail, and that Galba 
<A NAME="138"></A>had approved of the deed, either from weakness of character, or to avoid 
<A NAME="139"></A>investigation into the circumstances of acts which could not be altered. 
<A NAME="140"></A>Both executions, however, were unfavourably regarded; indeed, when a ruler 
<A NAME="141"></A>once becomes unpopular, all his acts, be they good or bad, tell against 
<A NAME="142"></A>him. The freedmen in their excessive power were now putting up everything 
<A NAME="143"></A>for sale; the slaves caught with greedy hands at immediate gain, and, reflecting 
<A NAME="144"></A>on their master's age, hastened to be rich. The new court had the same 
<A NAME="145"></A>abuses as the old, abuses as grievous as ever, but not so readily excused. 
<A NAME="146"></A>Even the age of Galba caused ridicule and disgust among those whose associations 
<A NAME="147"></A>were with the youth of Nero, and who were accustomed, as is the fashion 
<A NAME="148"></A>of the vulgar, to value their emperors by the beauty and grace of their 
<A NAME="149"></A>persons.
<A NAME="150"></A><BR><BR>Such, as far as one can speak of so vast a multitude, was the state 
<A NAME="151"></A>of feeling at Rome. Among the provinces, Spain was under the government 
<A NAME="152"></A>of Cluvius Rufus, an eloquent man, who had all the accomplishments of civil 
<A NAME="153"></A>life, but who was without experience in war. Gaul, besides remembering 
<A NAME="154"></A>Vindex, was bound to Galba by the recently conceded privileges of citizenship, 
<A NAME="155"></A>and by the diminution of its future tribute. Those Gallic states, however, 
<A NAME="156"></A>which were nearest to the armies of Germany, had not been treated with 
<A NAME="157"></A>the same respect, and had even in some cases been deprived of their territory; 
<A NAME="158"></A>and these were reckoning the gains of others and their own losses with 
<A NAME="159"></A>equal indignation. The armies of Germany were at once alarmed and angry, 
<A NAME="160"></A>a most dangerous temper when allied with such strength; while elated by 
<A NAME="161"></A>their recent victory, they feared because they might seem to have supported 
<A NAME="162"></A>an unsuccessful party. They had been slow to revolt from Nero, and Verginius 
<A NAME="163"></A>had not immediately declared for Galba; it was doubtful whether he had 
<A NAME="164"></A>himself wished to be emperor, but all agreed that the empire had been offered 
<A NAME="165"></A>to him by the soldiery. Again, the execution of Capito was a subject of 
<A NAME="166"></A>indignation, even with those who could not complain of its injustice. They 
<A NAME="167"></A>had no leader, for Verginius had been withdrawn on the pretext of his friendship 
<A NAME="168"></A>with the Emperor. That he was not sent back, and that he was even impeached, 
<A NAME="169"></A>they regarded as an accusation against themselves.
<A NAME="170"></A><BR><BR>The army of Upper Germany despised their legate, Hordeonius Flaccus, 
<A NAME="171"></A>who, disabled by age and lameness, had no strength of character and no 
<A NAME="172"></A>authority; even when the soldiery were quiet, he could not control them, 
<A NAME="173"></A>much more in their fits of frenzy were they irritated by the very feebleness 
<A NAME="174"></A>of his restraint. The legions of Lower Germany had long been without any 
<A NAME="175"></A>general of consular rank, until, by the appointment of Galba, Aulus Vitellius 
<A NAME="176"></A>took the command. He was son of that Vitellius who was censor and three 
<A NAME="177"></A>times consul; this was thought sufficient recommendation. In the army of 
<A NAME="178"></A>Britain there was no angry feeling; indeed no troops behaved more blamelessly 
<A NAME="179"></A>throughout all the troubles of these civil wars, either because they were 
<A NAME="180"></A>far away and separated by the ocean from the rest of the empire, or because 
<A NAME="181"></A>continual warfare had taught them to concentrate their hatred on the enemy. 
<A NAME="182"></A>Illyricum too was quiet, though the legions drawn from that province by 
<A NAME="183"></A>Nero had, while lingering in Italy, sent deputations to Verginius. But 
<A NAME="184"></A>separated as these armies were by long distances, a thing of all others 
<A NAME="185"></A>the most favourable for keeping troops to their duty, they could neither 
<A NAME="186"></A>communicate their vices, nor combine their strength.
<A NAME="187"></A><BR><BR>In the East there was as yet no movement. Syria and its four legions 
<A NAME="188"></A>were under the command of Licinius Mucianus, a man whose good and bad fortune 
<A NAME="189"></A>were equally famous. In his youth he had cultivated with many intrigues 
<A NAME="190"></A>the friendship of the great. His resources soon failed, and his position 
<A NAME="191"></A>became precarious, and as he also suspected that Claudius had taken some 
<A NAME="192"></A>offence, he withdrew into a retired part of Asia, and was as like an exile, 
<A NAME="193"></A>as he was afterwards like an emperor. He was a compound of dissipation 
<A NAME="194"></A>and energy, of arrogance and courtesy, of good and bad qualities. His self-indulgence 
<A NAME="195"></A>was excessive, when he had leisure, yet whenever he had served, he had 
<A NAME="196"></A>shown great qualities. In his public capacity he might be praised; his 
<A NAME="197"></A>private life was in bad repute. Yet over subjects, friends, and colleagues, 
<A NAME="198"></A>he exercised the influence of many fascinations. He was a man who would 
<A NAME="199"></A>find it easier to transfer the imperial power to another, than to hold 
<A NAME="200"></A>it for himself. Flavius Vespasian, a general of Nero's appointment, was 
<A NAME="201"></A>carrying on the war in Judaea with three legions, and he had no wish or 
<A NAME="202"></A>feeling adverse to Galba. He had in fact sent his son Titus to acknowledge 
<A NAME="203"></A>his authority and bespeak his favour, as in its proper place I shall relate. 
<A NAME="204"></A>As for the hidden decrees of fate, the omens and the oracles that marked 
<A NAME="205"></A>out Vespasian and his sons for imperial power, we believed in them only 
<A NAME="206"></A>after his success.
<A NAME="207"></A><BR><BR>Ever since the time of the Divine Augustus Roman Knights have ruled 
<A NAME="208"></A>Egypt as kings, and the forces by which it has to be kept in subjection. 
<A NAME="209"></A>It has been thought expedient thus to keep under home control a province 
<A NAME="210"></A>so difficult of access, so productive of corn, ever distracted, excitable, 
<A NAME="211"></A>and restless through the superstition and licentiousness of its inhabitants, 
<A NAME="212"></A>knowing nothing of laws, and unused to civil rule. Its governor was at 
<A NAME="213"></A>this time Tiberius Alexander, a native of the country. Africa and its legions, 
<A NAME="214"></A>now that Clodius Macer was dead, were disposed to be content with any emperor, 
<A NAME="215"></A>after having experienced the rule of a smaller tyrant. The two divisions 
<A NAME="216"></A>of Mauritania, Rhaetia, Noricum and Thrace and the other provinces governed 
<A NAME="217"></A>by procurators, as they were near this or that army, were driven by the 
<A NAME="218"></A>presence of such powerful neighbours into friendship or hostility. The 
<A NAME="219"></A>unarmed provinces with Italy at their head were exposed to any kind of 
<A NAME="220"></A>slavery, and were ready to become the prize of victory. Such was the state 
<A NAME="221"></A>of the Roman world, when Servius Galba, consul for the second time, with 
<A NAME="222"></A>T. Vinius for his colleague, entered upon a year, which was to be the last 
<A NAME="223"></A>of their lives, and which well nigh brought the commonwealth to an 
<A NAME="224"></A>end.
<A NAME="225"></A><BR><BR>A few days after the 1st of January, there arrived from Belgica 
<A NAME="226"></A>despatches of Pompeius Propinquus, the Procurator, to this effect; that 
<A NAME="227"></A>the legions of Upper Germany had broken through the obligation of their 
<A NAME="228"></A>military oath, and were demanding another emperor, but conceded the power 
<A NAME="229"></A>of choice to the Senate and people of Rome, in the hope that a more lenient 
<A NAME="230"></A>view might be taken of their revolt. These tidings hastened the plans of 
<A NAME="231"></A>Galba, who had been long debating the subject of adoption with himself 
<A NAME="232"></A>and with his intimate friends. There was indeed no more frequent subject 
<A NAME="233"></A>of conversation during these months, at first because men had liberty and 
<A NAME="234"></A>inclination to talk of such matters, afterwards because the feebleness 
<A NAME="235"></A>of Galba was notorious. Few had any discrimination or patriotism, many 
<A NAME="236"></A>had foolish hopes for themselves, and spread interested reports, in which 
<A NAME="237"></A>they named this or that person to whom they might be related as friend 
<A NAME="238"></A>or dependant. They were also moved by hatred of T. Vinius, who grew daily 
<A NAME="239"></A>more powerful, and in the same proportion more unpopular. The very easiness 
<A NAME="240"></A>of Galba's temper stimulated the greedy cupidity which great advancement 
<A NAME="241"></A>had excited in his friends, because with one so weak and so credulous wrong 
<A NAME="242"></A>might be done with less risk and greater gain.
<A NAME="243"></A><BR><BR>The real power of the Empire was divided between T. Vinius, the 
<A NAME="244"></A>consul, and Cornelius Laco, prefect of the Praetorian Guard. Icelus, a 
<A NAME="245"></A>freedman of Galba, was in equal favour; he had been presented with the 
<A NAME="246"></A>rings of knighthood, and bore the Equestrian name of Martianus. These men, 
<A NAME="247"></A>being at variance, and in smaller matters pursuing their own aims, were 
<A NAME="248"></A>divided in the affair of choosing a successor, into two opposing factions. 
<A NAME="249"></A>T. Vinius was for Marcus Otho, Laco and Icelus agreed, not indeed in supporting 
<A NAME="250"></A>any particular individual, but in striving for some one else. Galba indeed 
<A NAME="251"></A>was aware of the friendship between Vinius and Otho; the gossip of those 
<A NAME="252"></A>who allow nothing to pass in silence had named them as father-in-law and 
<A NAME="253"></A>son-in-law, for Vinius had a widowed daughter, and Otho was unmarried. 
<A NAME="254"></A>I believe that he had also at heart some care for the commonwealth, in 
<A NAME="255"></A>vain, he would think, rescued from Nero, if it was to be left with Otho. 
<A NAME="256"></A>For Otho's had been a neglected boyhood and a riotous youth, and he had 
<A NAME="257"></A>made himself agreeable to Nero by emulating his profligacy. For this reason 
<A NAME="258"></A>the Emperor had entrusted to him, as being the confidant of his amours, 
<A NAME="259"></A>Poppaea Sabina, the imperial favourite, until he could rid himself of his 
<A NAME="260"></A>wife Octavia. Soon suspecting him with regard to this same Poppaea, he 
<A NAME="261"></A>sent him out of the way to the province of Lusitania, ostensibly to be 
<A NAME="262"></A>its governor. Otho ruled the province with mildness, and, as he was the 
<A NAME="263"></A>first to join Galba's party, was not without energy, and, while the war 
<A NAME="264"></A>lasted, was the most conspicuous of the Emperor's followers, he was led 
<A NAME="265"></A>to cherish more and more passionately every day those hopes of adoption 
<A NAME="266"></A>which he had entertained from the first. Many of the soldiers favoured 
<A NAME="267"></A>him, and the court was biassed in his favour, because he resembled 
<A NAME="268"></A>Nero.
<A NAME="269"></A><BR><BR>When Galba heard of the mutiny in Germany, though nothing was as 
<A NAME="270"></A>yet known about Vitellius, he felt anxious as to the direction which the 
<A NAME="271"></A>violence of the legions might take, while he could not trust even the soldiery 
<A NAME="272"></A>of the capital. He therefore resorted to what he supposed to be the only 
<A NAME="273"></A>remedy, and held a council for the election of an emperor. To this he summoned, 
<A NAME="274"></A>besides Vinius and Laco, Marius Celsus, consul elect, and Ducennius Geminus, 
<A NAME="275"></A>prefect of the city. Having first said a few words about his advanced years, 
<A NAME="276"></A>he ordered Piso Licinianus to be summoned. It is uncertain whether he acted 
<A NAME="277"></A>on his own free choice, or, as believed by some, under the influence of 
<A NAME="278"></A>Laco, who through Rubellius Plautus had cultivated the friendship of Piso. 
<A NAME="279"></A>But, cunningly enough, it was as a stranger that Laco supported him, and 
<A NAME="280"></A>the high character of Piso gave weight to his advice. Piso, who was the 
<A NAME="281"></A>son of M. Crassus and Scribonia, and thus of noble descent on both sides, 
<A NAME="282"></A>was in look and manner a man of the old type. Rightly judged, he seemed 
<A NAME="283"></A>a stern man, morose to those who estimated him less favourably. This point 
<A NAME="284"></A>in his character pleased his adopted father in proportion as it raised 
<A NAME="285"></A>the anxious suspicions of others.
<A NAME="286"></A><BR><BR>We are told that Galba, taking hold of Piso's hand, spoke to this 
<A NAME="287"></A>effect: "If I were a private man, and were now adopting you by the Act 
<A NAME="288"></A>of the Curiae before the Pontiffs, as our custom is, it would be a high 
<A NAME="289"></A>honour to me to introduce into my family a descendant of Cn. Pompeius and 
<A NAME="290"></A>M. Crassus; it would be a distinction to you to add to the nobility of 
<A NAME="291"></A>your race the honours of the Sulpician and Lutatian houses. As it is, I, 
<A NAME="292"></A>who have been called to the throne by the unanimous consent of gods and 
<A NAME="293"></A>men, am moved by your splendid endowments and by my own patriotism to offer 
<A NAME="294"></A>to you, a man of peace, that power, for which our ancestors fought, and 
<A NAME="295"></A>which I myself obtained by war. I am following the precedent of the Divine 
<A NAME="296"></A>Augustus, who placed on an eminence next to his own, first his nephew Marcellus, 
<A NAME="297"></A>then his son-in-law Agrippa, afterwards his grandsons, and finally Tiberius 
<A NAME="298"></A>Nero, his stepson. But Augustus looked for a successor in his own family, 
<A NAME="299"></A>I look for one in the state, not because I have no relatives or companions 
<A NAME="300"></A>of my campaigns, but because it was not by any private favour that I myself 
<A NAME="301"></A>received the imperial power. Let the principle of my choice be shown not 
<A NAME="302"></A>only by my connections which I have set aside for you, but by your own. 
<A NAME="303"></A>You have a brother, noble as yourself, and older, who would be well worthy 
<A NAME="304"></A>of this dignity, were you not worthier. Your age is such as to be now free 
<A NAME="305"></A>from the passions of youth, and such your life that in the past you have 
<A NAME="306"></A>nothing to excuse. Hitherto, you have only borne adversity; prosperity 
<A NAME="307"></A>tries the heart with keener temptations; for hardships may be endured, 
<A NAME="308"></A>whereas we are spoiled by success. You indeed will cling with the same 
<A NAME="309"></A>constancy to honor, freedom, friendship, the best possessions of the human 
<A NAME="310"></A>spirit, but others will seek to weaken them with their servility. You will 
<A NAME="311"></A>be fiercely assailed by adulation, by flattery, that worst poison of the 
<A NAME="312"></A>true heart, and by the selfish interests of individuals. You and I speak 
<A NAME="313"></A>together to-day with perfect frankness, but others will be more ready to 
<A NAME="314"></A>address us as emperors than as men. For to urge his duty upon a prince 
<A NAME="315"></A>is indeed a hard matter; to flatter him, whatever his character, is a mere 
<A NAME="316"></A>routine gone through without any heart.
<A NAME="317"></A><BR><BR>"Could the vast frame of this empire have stood and preserved its 
<A NAME="318"></A>balance without a directing spirit, I was not unworthy of inaugurating 
<A NAME="319"></A>a republic. As it is, we have been long reduced to a position, in which 
<A NAME="320"></A>my age confer no greater boon on the Roman people than a good successor, 
<A NAME="321"></A>your youth no greater than a good emperor. Under Tuberous, Chairs, and 
<A NAME="322"></A>Claudius, we were, so to speak, the inheritance of a single family. The 
<A NAME="323"></A>choice which begins with us will be a substitute for freedom. Now that 
<A NAME="324"></A>the family of the Julii and the Claudii has come to an end, adoption will 
<A NAME="325"></A>discover the worthiest successor. To be begotten and born of a princely 
<A NAME="326"></A>race is a mere accident, and is only valued as such. In adoption there 
<A NAME="327"></A>is nothing that need bias the judgment, and if you wish to make a choice, 
<A NAME="328"></A>an unanimous opinion points out the man. Let Nero be ever before your eyes, 
<A NAME="329"></A>swollen with the pride of a long line of Caesars; it was not Vindex with 
<A NAME="330"></A>his unarmed province, it was not myself with my single legion, that shook 
<A NAME="331"></A>his yoke from our necks. It was his own profligacy, his own brutality, 
<A NAME="332"></A>and that, though there had been before no precedent of an emperor condemned 
<A NAME="333"></A>by his own people. We, who have been called to power by the issues of war, 
<A NAME="334"></A>and by the deliberate judgment of others, shall incur unpopularity, however 
<A NAME="335"></A>illustrious our character. Do not however be alarmed, if, after a movement 
<A NAME="336"></A>which has shaken the world, two legions are not yet quiet. I did not myself 
<A NAME="337"></A>succeed to a throne without anxiety; and when men shall hear of your adoption 
<A NAME="338"></A>I shall no longer be thought old, and this is the only objection which 
<A NAME="339"></A>is now made against me. Nero will always be regretted by the thoroughly 
<A NAME="340"></A>depraved; it is for you and me to take care, that he be not regretted also 
<A NAME="341"></A>by the good. To prolong such advice, suits not this occasion, and all my 
<A NAME="342"></A>purpose is fulfilled if I have made a good choice in you. The most practical 
<A NAME="343"></A>and the shortest method of distinguishing between good and bad measures, 
<A NAME="344"></A>is to think what you yourself would or would not like under another emperor. 
<A NAME="345"></A>It is not here, as it is among nations despotically ruled, that there is 
<A NAME="346"></A>a distinct governing family, while all the rest are slaves. You have to 
<A NAME="347"></A>reign over men who cannot bear either absolute slavery or absolute freedom." 
<A NAME="348"></A>This, with more to the same effect, was said by Galba; he spoke to Piso 
<A NAME="349"></A>as if he were creating an emperor; the others addressed him as if he were 
<A NAME="350"></A>an emperor already.
<A NAME="351"></A><BR><BR>It is said of Piso that he betrayed no discomposure or excessive 
<A NAME="352"></A>joy, either to the gaze to which he was immediately subjected, or afterwards 
<A NAME="353"></A>when all eyes were turned upon him. His language to the Emperor, his father, 
<A NAME="354"></A>was reverential; his language about himself was modest. He shewed no change 
<A NAME="355"></A>in look or manner; he seemed like one who had the power rather than the 
<A NAME="356"></A>wish to rule. It was next discussed whether the adoption should be publicly 
<A NAME="357"></A>pronounced in front of the Rostra, in the Senate, or in the camp. It was 
<A NAME="358"></A>thought best to go to the camp. This would be a compliment to the soldiery, 
<A NAME="359"></A>and their favour, base as it was to purchase it by bribery or intrigue, 
<A NAME="360"></A>was not to be despised if it could be obtained by honourable means. Meanwhile 
<A NAME="361"></A>the expectant people had surrounded the palace, impatient to learn the 
<A NAME="362"></A>great secret, and those who sought to stifle the ill-concealed rumour did 
<A NAME="363"></A>but spread it the more.
<A NAME="364"></A><BR><BR>The 10th of January was a gloomy, stormy day, unusually disturbed 
<A NAME="365"></A>by thunder, lightning, and all bad omens from heaven. Though this had from 
<A NAME="366"></A>ancient time been made a reason for dissolving an assembly, it did not 
<A NAME="367"></A>deter Galba from proceeding to the camp; either because he despised such 
<A NAME="368"></A>things as being mere matters of chance, or because the decrees of fate, 
<A NAME="369"></A>though they be foreshewn, are not escaped. Addressing a crowded assembly 
<A NAME="370"></A>of the soldiers he announced, with imperial brevity, that he adopted Piso, 
<A NAME="371"></A>following the precedent of the Divine Augustus, and the military custom 
<A NAME="372"></A>by which a soldier chooses his comrade. Fearing that to conceal the mutiny 
<A NAME="373"></A>would be to make them think it greater than it really was, he spontaneously 
<A NAME="374"></A>declared that the 4th and 18th legions, led by a few factious persons, 
<A NAME="375"></A>had been insubordinate, but had not gone beyond certain words and cries, 
<A NAME="376"></A>and that they would soon return to their duty. To this speech he added 
<A NAME="377"></A>no word of flattery, no hint of a bribe. Yet the tribunes, the centurions, 
<A NAME="378"></A>and such of the soldiers as stood near, made an encouraging response. A 
<A NAME="379"></A>gloomy silence prevailed among the rest, who seemed to think that they 
<A NAME="380"></A>had lost by war that right to a donative which they had made good even 
<A NAME="381"></A>in peace. It is certain that their feelings might have been conciliated 
<A NAME="382"></A>by the very smallest liberality on the part of the parsimonious old man. 
<A NAME="383"></A>He was ruined by his old-fashioned inflexibility, and by an excessive sternness 
<A NAME="384"></A>which we are no longer able to endure.
<A NAME="385"></A><BR><BR>Then followed Galba's speech in the Senate, which was as plain 
<A NAME="386"></A>and brief as his speech to the soldiery. Piso delivered a graceful oration 
<A NAME="387"></A>and was supported by the feeling of the Senate. Many who wished him well, 
<A NAME="388"></A>spoke with enthusiasm; those who had opposed him, in moderate terms; the 
<A NAME="389"></A>majority met him with an officious homage, having aims of their own and 
<A NAME="390"></A>no thought for the state. Piso neither said nor did anything else in public 
<A NAME="391"></A>in the following four days which intervened between his adoption and his 
<A NAME="392"></A>death. As tidings of the mutiny in Germany were arriving with daily increasing 
<A NAME="393"></A>frequency, while the country was ready to receive and to credit all intelligence 
<A NAME="394"></A>that had an unfavourable character, the Senate came to a resolution to 
<A NAME="395"></A>send deputies to the German armies. It was privately discussed whether 
<A NAME="396"></A>Piso should go with them to give them a more imposing appearance; they, 
<A NAME="397"></A>it was said, would bring with them the authority of the Senate, he the 
<A NAME="398"></A>majesty of the Caesar. It was thought expedient to send with them Cornelius 
<A NAME="399"></A>Laco, prefect of the Praetorian Guard, but he thwarted the design. In nominating, 
<A NAME="400"></A>excusing, and changing the deputies, the Senate having entrusted the selection 
<A NAME="401"></A>to Galba, the Emperor shewed a disgraceful want of firmness, yielding to 
<A NAME="402"></A>individuals, who made interest to stay or to go, as their fears or their 
<A NAME="403"></A>hopes prompted.
<A NAME="404"></A><BR><BR>Next came the question of money. On a general inquiry it seemed 
<A NAME="405"></A>the fairest course to demand restitution from those who had caused the 
<A NAME="406"></A>public poverty. Nero had squandered in presents two thousand two hundred 
<A NAME="407"></A>million sesterces. It was ordered that each recipient should be sued, but 
<A NAME="408"></A>should be permitted to retain a tenth part of the bounty. They had however 
<A NAME="409"></A>barely a tenth part left, having wasted the property of others in the same 
<A NAME="410"></A>extravagances in which they had squandered their own, till the most rapacious 
<A NAME="411"></A>and profligate among them had neither capital nor land remaining, nothing 
<A NAME="412"></A>in fact but the appliances of their vices. Thirty Roman Knights were appointed 
<A NAME="413"></A>to conduct the process of recovery, a novel office, and made burdensome 
<A NAME="414"></A>by the number and intriguing practices of those with whom it had to deal. 
<A NAME="415"></A>Everywhere were sales and brokers, and Rome was in an uproar with auctions. 
<A NAME="416"></A>Yet great was the joy to think that the men whom Nero had enriched would 
<A NAME="417"></A>be as poor as those whom he had robbed. About this time were cashiered 
<A NAME="418"></A>two tribunes of the Praetorian Guard, Antonius Taurus and Antonius Naso, 
<A NAME="419"></A>an officer of the City cohorts, Aemilius Pacensis, and one of the watch, 
<A NAME="420"></A>Julius Fronto. This led to no amendment with the rest, but only started 
<A NAME="421"></A>the apprehension, that a crafty and timid policy was getting rid of individuals, 
<A NAME="422"></A>while all were suspected.
<A NAME="423"></A><BR><BR>Otho, meanwhile, who had nothing to hope while the State was tranquil, 
<A NAME="424"></A>and whose whole plans depended on revolution, was being roused to action 
<A NAME="425"></A>by a combination of many motives, by a luxury that would have embarrassed 
<A NAME="426"></A>even an emperor, by a poverty that a subject could hardly endure, by his 
<A NAME="427"></A>rage against Galba, by his envy of Piso. He even pretended to fear to make 
<A NAME="428"></A>himself keener in desire. "I was, said he, "too formidable to Nero, and 
<A NAME="429"></A>I must not look for another Lusitania, another honourable exile. Rulers 
<A NAME="430"></A>always suspect and hate the man who has been named for the succession. 
<A NAME="431"></A>This has injured me with the aged Emperor, and will injure me yet more 
<A NAME="432"></A>with a young man whose temper, naturally savage, has been rendered ferocious 
<A NAME="433"></A>by prolonged exile. How easy to put Otho to death! I must therefore do 
<A NAME="434"></A>and dare now while Galba's authority is still unsettled, and before that 
<A NAME="435"></A>of Piso is consolidated. Periods of transition suit great attempts, and 
<A NAME="436"></A>delay is useless where inaction is more hurtful than temerity. Death, which 
<A NAME="437"></A>nature ordains for all alike, yet admits of the distinction of being either 
<A NAME="438"></A>forgotten, or remembered with honour by posterity; and, if the same lot 
<A NAME="439"></A>awaits the innocent and the guilty, the man of spirit will at least deserve 
<A NAME="440"></A>his fate."
<A NAME="441"></A><BR><BR>The soul of Otho was not effeminate like his person. His confidential 
<A NAME="442"></A>freedmen and slaves, who enjoyed a license unknown in private families, 
<A NAME="443"></A>brought the debaucheries of Nero's court, its intrigues, its easy marriages, 
<A NAME="444"></A>and the other indulgences of despotic power, before a mind passionately 
<A NAME="445"></A>fond of such things, dwelt upon them as his if he dared to seize them, 
<A NAME="446"></A>and reproached the inaction that would leave them to others. The astrologers 
<A NAME="447"></A>also urged him to action, predicting from their observation of the heavens 
<A NAME="448"></A>revolutions, and a year of glory for Otho. This is a class of men, whom 
<A NAME="449"></A>the powerful cannot trust, and who deceive the aspiring, a class which 
<A NAME="450"></A>will always be proscribed in this country, and yet always retained. Many 
<A NAME="451"></A>of these men were attached to the secret councils of Poppaea and were the 
<A NAME="452"></A>vilest tools in the employ of the imperial household. One of them, Ptolemaeus, 
<A NAME="453"></A>had attended Otho in Spain, and had there foretold that his patron would 
<A NAME="454"></A>survive Nero. Gaining credit by the result, and arguing from his own conjectures 
<A NAME="455"></A>and from the common talk of those who compared Galba's age with Otho's 
<A NAME="456"></A>youth, he had persuaded the latter that he would be called to the throne. 
<A NAME="457"></A>Otho however received the prediction as the words of wisdom and the intimation 
<A NAME="458"></A>of destiny, with that inclination so natural to the human mind readily 
<A NAME="459"></A>to believe in the mysterious.
<A NAME="460"></A><BR><BR>Nor did Ptolemaeus fail to play his part; he now even prompted 
<A NAME="461"></A>to crime, to which from such wishes it is easy to pass. Whether indeed 
<A NAME="462"></A>these thoughts of crime were suddenly conceived, is doubtful. Otho had 
<A NAME="463"></A>long been courting the affections of the soldiery, either in the hope of 
<A NAME="464"></A>succeeding to the throne, or in preparation for some desperate act. On 
<A NAME="465"></A>the march, on parade, and in their quarters, he would address all the oldest 
<A NAME="466"></A>soldiers by name, and in allusion to the progresses of Nero would call 
<A NAME="467"></A>them his messmates. Some he would recognise, he would inquire after others, 
<A NAME="468"></A>and would help them with his money and interest. He would often intersperse 
<A NAME="469"></A>his conversation with complaints and insinuations against Galba and anything 
<A NAME="470"></A>else that might excite the vulgar mind. Laborious marches, a scanty commissariat, 
<A NAME="471"></A>and the rigour of military discipline, were especially distasteful, when 
<A NAME="472"></A>men, accustomed to sail to the lakes of Campania and the cities of Greece, 
<A NAME="473"></A>had painfully to struggle under the weight of their arms over the Pyrenees, 
<A NAME="474"></A>the Alps, and vast distances of road.
<A NAME="475"></A><BR><BR>The minds of the soldiery were already on fire, when Maevius Pudens, 
<A NAME="476"></A>a near relative of Tigellinus, added, so to speak, fuel to the flames. 
<A NAME="477"></A>In his endeavour to win over all who were particularly weak in character, 
<A NAME="478"></A>or who wanted money and were ready to plunge into revolution, he gradually 
<A NAME="479"></A>went so far as to distribute, whenever Galba dined with Otho, one hundred 
<A NAME="480"></A>sesterces to each soldier of the cohort on duty, under pretext of treating 
<A NAME="481"></A>them. This, which we may almost call a public bounty, Otho followed up 
<A NAME="482"></A>by presents more privately bestowed on individuals; nay he bribed with 
<A NAME="483"></A>such spirit, that, finding there was a dispute between Cocceius Proculus, 
<A NAME="484"></A>a soldier of the bodyguard, and one of his neighbours, about some part 
<A NAME="485"></A>of their boundaries, he purchased with his own money the neighbour's entire 
<A NAME="486"></A>estate, and made a present of it to the soldier. He took advantage of the 
<A NAME="487"></A>lazy indifference of the Prefect, who overlooked alike notorious facts 
<A NAME="488"></A>and secret practices.
<A NAME="489"></A><BR><BR>He then entrusted the conduct of his meditated treason to Onomastus, 
<A NAME="490"></A>one of his freedmen, who brought over to his views Barbius Proculus, officer 
<A NAME="491"></A>of the watchword to the bodyguard, and Veturius, a deputy centurion in 
<A NAME="492"></A>the same force. Having assured himself by various conversations with these 
<A NAME="493"></A>men that they were cunning and bold, he loaded them with presents and promises, 
<A NAME="494"></A>and furnished them with money with which to tempt the cupidity of others. 
<A NAME="495"></A>Thus two soldiers from the ranks undertook to transfer the Empire of Rome, 
<A NAME="496"></A>and actually transferred it. Only a few were admitted to be accomplices 
<A NAME="497"></A>in the plot, but they worked by various devices on the wavering minds of 
<A NAME="498"></A>the remainder; on the more distinguished soldiers, by hinting that the 
<A NAME="499"></A>favours of Nymphidius had subjected them to suspicion; on the vulgar herd, 
<A NAME="500"></A>by the anger and despair with which the repeated postponement of the donative 
<A NAME="501"></A>had inspired them. Some were fired by their recollections of Nero and their 
<A NAME="502"></A>longing regrets for their old license. All felt a common alarm at the idea 
<A NAME="503"></A>of having to serve elsewhere.
<A NAME="504"></A><BR><BR>The contagion spread to the legions and the auxiliary troops, already 
<A NAME="505"></A>excited by the news of the wavering loyalty of the army of Germany. So 
<A NAME="506"></A>ripe were the disaffected for mutiny and so close the secrecy preserved 
<A NAME="507"></A>by the loyal, that they would actually have seized Otho on the 14th of 
<A NAME="508"></A>January, as he was returning from dinner, had they not been deterred by 
<A NAME="509"></A>the risks of darkness, the inconvenient dispersion of the troops over the 
<A NAME="510"></A>whole city, and the difficulty of concerted action among a half-intoxicated 
<A NAME="511"></A>crowd. It was no care for the state, which they deliberately meditated 
<A NAME="512"></A>polluting with the blood of their Emperor; it was a fear lest in the darkness 
<A NAME="513"></A>of night any one who presented himself to the soldiers of the Pannonian 
<A NAME="514"></A>or German army might be fixed on instead of Otho, whom few of them knew. 
<A NAME="515"></A>Many symptoms of the approaching outburst were repressed by those who were 
<A NAME="516"></A>in the secret. Some hints, which had reached Galba's ears, were turned 
<A NAME="517"></A>into ridicule by Laco the prefect, who knew nothing of the temper of the 
<A NAME="518"></A>soldiery, and who, inimical to all measures, however excellent, which he 
<A NAME="519"></A>did not originate, obstinately thwarted men wiser than 
<A NAME="520"></A>himself.
<A NAME="521"></A><BR><BR>On the 15th of January, as Galba was sacrificing in front of the 
<A NAME="522"></A>temple of Apollo, the Haruspex Umbricius announced to him that the entrails 
<A NAME="523"></A>had a sinister aspect, that treachery threatened him, that he had an enemy 
<A NAME="524"></A>at home. Otho heard, for he had taken his place close by, and interpreted 
<A NAME="525"></A>it by contraries in a favourable sense, as promising success to his designs. 
<A NAME="526"></A>Not long after his freedman Onomastus informed him that the architect and 
<A NAME="527"></A>the contractors were waiting for him. It had been arranged thus to indicate 
<A NAME="528"></A>that the soldiers were assembling, and that the preparations of the conspiracy 
<A NAME="529"></A>were complete. To those who inquired the reason of his departure, Otho 
<A NAME="530"></A>pretended that he was purchasing certain farm-buildings, which from their 
<A NAME="531"></A>age he suspected to be unsound, and which had therefore to be first surveyed. 
<A NAME="532"></A>Leaning on his freedman's arm, he proceeded through the palace of Tiberius 
<A NAME="533"></A>to the Velabrum, and thence to the golden milestone near the temple of 
<A NAME="534"></A>Saturn. There three and twenty soldiers of the body-guard saluted him as 
<A NAME="535"></A>Emperor, and, while he trembled at their scanty number, put him hastily 
<A NAME="536"></A>into a chair, drew their swords, and hurried him onwards. About as many 
<A NAME="537"></A>more soldiers joined them on their way, some because they were in the plot, 
<A NAME="538"></A>many from mere surprise; some shouted and brandished their swords, others 
<A NAME="539"></A>proceeded in silence, intending to let the issue determine their 
<A NAME="540"></A>sentiments.
<A NAME="541"></A><BR><BR>Julius Martialis was the tribune on guard in the camp. Appalled 
<A NAME="542"></A>by the enormity and suddenness of the crime, or perhaps fearing that the 
<A NAME="543"></A>troops were very extensively corrupted and that it would be destruction 
<A NAME="544"></A>to oppose them, he made many suspect him of complicity. The rest of the 
<A NAME="545"></A>tribunes and centurions preferred immediate safety to danger and duty. 
<A NAME="546"></A>Such was the temper of men's minds, that, while there were few to venture 
<A NAME="547"></A>on so atrocious a treason, many wished it done, and all were ready to 
<A NAME="548"></A>acquiesce.
<A NAME="549"></A><BR><BR>Meanwhile the unconscious Galba, busy with his sacrifice, was importuning 
<A NAME="550"></A>the gods of an empire that was now another's. A rumour reached him, that 
<A NAME="551"></A>some senator unknown was being hurried into the camp; before long it was 
<A NAME="552"></A>affirmed that this senator was Otho. At the same time came messengers from 
<A NAME="553"></A>all parts of the city, where they had chanced to meet the procession, some 
<A NAME="554"></A>exaggerating the danger, some, who could not even then forget to flatter, 
<A NAME="555"></A>representing it as less than the reality. On deliberation it was determined 
<A NAME="556"></A>to sound the feeling of the cohort on guard in the palace, but not through 
<A NAME="557"></A>Galba in person, whose authority was to be kept unimpaired to meet greater 
<A NAME="558"></A>emergencies. They were accordingly collected before the steps of the palace, 
<A NAME="559"></A>and Piso addressed them as follows:- "Comrades, this is the sixth day since 
<A NAME="560"></A>I became a Caesar by adoption, not knowing what was to happen, whether 
<A NAME="561"></A>this title was to be desired, or dreaded. It rests with you to determine 
<A NAME="562"></A>what will be the result to my family and to the state. It is not that I 
<A NAME="563"></A>dread on my own account the gloomier issue; for I have known adversity, 
<A NAME="564"></A>and I am learning at this very moment that prosperity is fully as dangerous. 
<A NAME="565"></A>It is the lot of my father, of the Senate, of the Empire itself, that I 
<A NAME="566"></A>deplore, if we have either to fall this day, or to do what is equally abhorrent 
<A NAME="567"></A>to the good, to put others to death. In the late troubles we had this consolation, 
<A NAME="568"></A>a capital unstained by bloodshed, and power transferred without strife. 
<A NAME="569"></A>It was thought that by my adoption provision was made against the possibility 
<A NAME="570"></A>of war, even after Galba's death. "I will lay no claim to nobleness, or 
<A NAME="571"></A>moderation, for indeed, to count up virtues in comparing oneself with Otho 
<A NAME="572"></A>is needless. The vices, of which alone he boasts, overthrew the Empire, 
<A NAME="573"></A>even when he was but the Emperor's friend. Shall he earn that Empire now 
<A NAME="574"></A>by his manner and his gait, or by those womanish adornments? They are deceived, 
<A NAME="575"></A>on whom luxury imposes by its false show of liberality; he will know how 
<A NAME="576"></A>to squander, he will not know how to give. Already he is thinking of debaucheries, 
<A NAME="577"></A>of revels, of tribes of mistresses. These things he holds to be the prizes 
<A NAME="578"></A>of princely power, things, in which the wanton enjoyment will be for him 
<A NAME="579"></A>alone, the shame and the disgrace for all. Never yet has any one exercised 
<A NAME="580"></A>for good ends the power obtained by crime. The unanimous will of mankind 
<A NAME="581"></A>gave to Galba the title of Caesar, and you consented when he gave it to 
<A NAME="582"></A>me. Were the Senate, the Country, the People, but empty names, yet, comrades, 
<A NAME="583"></A>it is your interest that the most worthless of men should not create an 
<A NAME="584"></A>Emperor. We have occasionally heard of legions mutinying against their 
<A NAME="585"></A>generals, but your loyalty, your character, stand unimpeached up to this 
<A NAME="586"></A>time. Even with Nero, it was he that deserted you, not you that deserted 
<A NAME="587"></A>him. Shall less than thirty runaways and deserters whom no one would allow 
<A NAME="588"></A>to choose a tribune or centurion for themselves, assign the Empire at their 
<A NAME="589"></A>pleasure? Do you tolerate the precedent? Do you by your inaction make the 
<A NAME="590"></A>crime your own? This lawless spirit will pass into the provinces, and though 
<A NAME="591"></A>we shall suffer from this treason, you will suffer from the wars that will 
<A NAME="592"></A>follow. Again, no more is offered you for murdering your Prince, than you 
<A NAME="593"></A>will have if you shun such guilt. We shall give you a donative for your 
<A NAME="594"></A>loyalty, as surely as others can give it for your treason."
<A NAME="595"></A><BR><BR>The soldiers of the body-guard dispersed, but the rest of the cohort, 
<A NAME="596"></A>who shewed no disrespect to the speaker, displayed their standards, acting, 
<A NAME="597"></A>as often happens in a disturbance, on mere impulse and without any settled 
<A NAME="598"></A>plan, rather than, as was afterwards believed, with treachery and an intention 
<A NAME="599"></A>to deceive. Celsus Marius was sent to the picked troops from the army of 
<A NAME="600"></A>Illyricum, then encamped in the Portico of Vipsanius. Instructions were 
<A NAME="601"></A>also given to Amulius Serenus and Quintius Sabinus, centurions of the first 
<A NAME="602"></A>rank, to bring up the German soldiers from the Hall of Liberty. No confidence 
<A NAME="603"></A>was placed in the legion levied from the fleet, which had been enraged 
<A NAME="604"></A>by the massacre of their comrades, whom Galba had slaughtered immediately 
<A NAME="605"></A>on his entry into the capital. Meanwhile Cetrius Severus, Subrius Dexter, 
<A NAME="606"></A>and Pompeius Longinus, all three military tribunes, proceeded to the Praetorian 
<A NAME="607"></A>camp, in the hope that a sedition, which was but just commencing, and not 
<A NAME="608"></A>yet fully matured, might be swayed by better counsels. Two of these tribunes, 
<A NAME="609"></A>Subrius and Cetrius, the soldiers assailed with menaces; Longinus they 
<A NAME="610"></A>seized and disarmed; it was not his rank as an officer, but his friendship 
<A NAME="611"></A>with Galba, that bound him to that Prince, and roused a stronger suspicion 
<A NAME="612"></A>in the mutineers. The legion levied from the fleet joined the Praetorians 
<A NAME="613"></A>without any hesitation. The Illyrian detachments drove Celsus away with 
<A NAME="614"></A>a shower of javelins. The German veterans wavered long. Their frames were 
<A NAME="615"></A>still enfeebled by sickness, and their minds were favourably disposed towards 
<A NAME="616"></A>Galba, who, finding them exhausted by their long return voyage from Alexandria, 
<A NAME="617"></A>whither they had been sent on by Nero, had supplied their wants with a 
<A NAME="618"></A>most unsparing attention.
<A NAME="619"></A><BR><BR>The whole populace and the slaves with them were now crowding the 
<A NAME="620"></A>palace, clamouring with discordant shouts for the death of Otho and the 
<A NAME="621"></A>destruction of the conspirators, just as if they were demanding some spectacle 
<A NAME="622"></A>in the circus or amphitheatre. They had not indeed any discrimination or 
<A NAME="623"></A>sincerity, for on that same day they would raise with equal zeal a wholly 
<A NAME="624"></A>different cry. It was their traditional custom to flatter any ruler with 
<A NAME="625"></A>reckless applause and meaningless zeal. Meanwhile two suggestions were 
<A NAME="626"></A>keeping Galba in doubt. T. Vinius thought that he should remain within 
<A NAME="627"></A>the palace, array the slaves against the foe, secure the approaches, and 
<A NAME="628"></A>not go out to the enraged soldiers. "You should," he said, "give the disaffected 
<A NAME="629"></A>time to repent, the loyal time to unite. Crimes gain by hasty action, better 
<A NAME="630"></A>counsels by delay. At all events, you will still have the same facilities 
<A NAME="631"></A>of going out, if need be, whereas, your retreat, should you repent of having 
<A NAME="632"></A>gone, will be in the power of another."
<A NAME="633"></A><BR><BR>The rest were for speedy action, "before," they said, "the yet 
<A NAME="634"></A>feeble treason of this handful of men can gather strength. Otho himself 
<A NAME="635"></A>will be alarmed, Otho, who stole away to be introduced to a few strangers, 
<A NAME="636"></A>but who now, thanks to the hesitation and inaction in which we waste our 
<A NAME="637"></A>time, is learning how to play the Prince. We must not wait till, having 
<A NAME="638"></A>arranged matters in the camp, he bursts into the Forum, and under Galba's 
<A NAME="639"></A>very eyes makes his way to the Capitol, while our noble Emperor with his 
<A NAME="640"></A>brave friends barricades the doors of his palace. We are to stand a siege 
<A NAME="641"></A>forsooth, and truly we shall have an admirable resource in the slaves, 
<A NAME="642"></A>if the unanimous feeling of this vast multitude, and that which can do 
<A NAME="643"></A>so much, the first burst of indignation, be suffered to subside. Moreover 
<A NAME="644"></A>that cannot be safe which is not honourable. If we must fall, let us go 
<A NAME="645"></A>to meet the danger. This will bring more odium upon Otho, and will be more 
<A NAME="646"></A>becoming to ourselves." Vinius opposing this advice, Laco assailed him 
<A NAME="647"></A>with threats, encouraged by Icelus, who persisted in his private animosities 
<A NAME="648"></A>to the public ruin.
<A NAME="649"></A><BR><BR>Without further delay Galba sided with these more plausible advisers. 
<A NAME="650"></A>Piso was sent on into the camp, as being a young man of noble name, whose 
<A NAME="651"></A>popularity was of recent date, and who was a bitter enemy to T. Vinius, 
<A NAME="652"></A>that is, either he was so in reality, or these angry partisans would have 
<A NAME="653"></A>it so, and belief in hatred is but too ready. Piso had hardly gone forth 
<A NAME="654"></A>when there came a rumour, at first vague and wanting confirmation, that 
<A NAME="655"></A>Otho had been slain in the camp; soon, as happens with these great fictions, 
<A NAME="656"></A>men asserted that they had been present, and had seen the deed; and, between 
<A NAME="657"></A>the delight of some and the indifference of others, the report was easily 
<A NAME="658"></A>believed. Many thought the rumour had been invented and circulated by the 
<A NAME="659"></A>Othonianists, who were now mingling with the crowd, and who disseminated 
<A NAME="660"></A>these false tidings of success to draw Galba out of the 
<A NAME="661"></A>palace.
<A NAME="662"></A><BR><BR>Upon this not only did the people and the ignorant rabble break 
<A NAME="663"></A>out into applause and vehement expressions of zeal, but many of the Knights 
<A NAME="664"></A>and Senators, losing their caution as they laid aside their fear, burst 
<A NAME="665"></A>open the doors of the palace, rushed in, and displayed themselves to Galba, 
<A NAME="666"></A>complaining that their revenge had been snatched from them. The most arrant 
<A NAME="667"></A>coward, the man, who, as the event proved, would dare nothing in the moment 
<A NAME="668"></A>of danger, was the most voluble and fierce of speech. No one knew anything, 
<A NAME="669"></A>yet all were confident in assertion, till at length Galba in the dearth 
<A NAME="670"></A>of all true intelligence, and overborne by the universal delusion, assumed 
<A NAME="671"></A>his cuirass, and as, from age and bodily weakness, he could not stand up 
<A NAME="672"></A>against the crowd that was still rushing in, he was elevated on a chair. 
<A NAME="673"></A>He was met in the palace by Julius Atticus, a soldier of the body-guard, 
<A NAME="674"></A>who, displaying a bloody sword, cried "I have slain Otho." "Comrade," replied 
<A NAME="675"></A>Galba, "who gave the order?" So singularly resolute was his spirit in curbing 
<A NAME="676"></A>the license of the soldiery; threats did not dismay him, nor flatteries 
<A NAME="677"></A>seduce.
<A NAME="678"></A><BR><BR>There was now no doubt about the feeling of all the troops in the 
<A NAME="679"></A>camp. So great was their zeal, that, not content with surrounding Otho 
<A NAME="680"></A>with their persons in close array, they elevated him to the pedestal, on 
<A NAME="681"></A>which a short time before had stood the gilt statue of Galba, and there, 
<A NAME="682"></A>amid the standards, encircled him with their colours. Neither tribunes 
<A NAME="683"></A>nor centurions could approach. The common soldiers even insisted that all 
<A NAME="684"></A>the officers should be watched. Everything was in an uproar with their 
<A NAME="685"></A>tumultuous cries and their appeals to each other, which were not, like 
<A NAME="686"></A>those of a popular assembly or a mob, the discordant expressions of an 
<A NAME="687"></A>idle flattery; on the contrary, as soon as they caught sight of any of 
<A NAME="688"></A>the soldiers who were flocking in, they seized him, gave him the military 
<A NAME="689"></A>embrace, placed him close to Otho, dictated to him the oath of allegiance, 
<A NAME="690"></A>commending sometimes the Emperor to his soldiers, sometimes the soldiers 
<A NAME="691"></A>to their Emperor. Otho did not fail to play his part; he stretched out 
<A NAME="692"></A>his arms, and bowed to the crowd, and kissed his hands, and altogether 
<A NAME="693"></A>acted the slave, to make himself the master. It was when the whole legion 
<A NAME="694"></A>from the fleet had taken the oath to him, that feeling confidence in his 
<A NAME="695"></A>strength, and thinking that the men, on whose individual feeling he had 
<A NAME="696"></A>been working, should be roused by a general appeal, he stood before the 
<A NAME="697"></A>rampart of the camp, and spoke as follows:
<A NAME="698"></A><BR><BR>"Comrades, I cannot say in what character I have presented myself 
<A NAME="699"></A>to you; I refuse to call myself a subject, now that you have named me Prince, 
<A NAME="700"></A>or Prince, while another reigns. Your title also will be equally uncertain, 
<A NAME="701"></A>so long as it shall be a question, whether it is the Emperor of the Roman 
<A NAME="702"></A>people, or a public enemy, whom you have in your camp. Mark you, how in 
<A NAME="703"></A>one breath they cry for my punishment and for your execution. So evident 
<A NAME="704"></A>it is, that we can neither perish, nor be saved, except together. Perhaps, 
<A NAME="705"></A>with his usual clemency, Galba has already promised that we should die, 
<A NAME="706"></A>like the man, who, though no one demanded it, massacred so many thousands 
<A NAME="707"></A>of perfectly guiltless soldiers. A shudder comes over my soul, whenever 
<A NAME="708"></A>I call to mind that ghastly entry, Galba's solitary victory, when, before 
<A NAME="709"></A>the eyes of the capital he gave orders to decimate the prisoners, the suppliants, 
<A NAME="710"></A>whom he had admitted to surrender. These were the auspices with which he 
<A NAME="711"></A>entered the city. What is the glory that he has brought to the throne? 
<A NAME="712"></A>None but that he has murdered Obultronius Sabinus and Cornelius Marcellus 
<A NAME="713"></A>in Spain, Betuus Chilo in Gaul, Fonteius Capito in Germany, Clodius Macer 
<A NAME="714"></A>in Africa, Cingonius on the high road, Turpilianus in the city, Nymphidius 
<A NAME="715"></A>in the camp. What province, what camp in the world, but is stained with 
<A NAME="716"></A>blood and foul with crime, or, as he expresses it himself, purified and 
<A NAME="717"></A>chastened? For what others call crimes he calls reforms, and, by similar 
<A NAME="718"></A>misnomers, he speaks of strictness instead of barbarity, of economy instead 
<A NAME="719"></A>of avarice, while the cruelties and affronts inflicted upon you he calls 
<A NAME="720"></A>discipline. Seven months only have passed since Nero fell, and already 
<A NAME="721"></A>Icelus has seized more than the Polycleti, the Vatinii, and the Elii amassed. 
<A NAME="722"></A>Vinius would not have gone so far with his rapacity and lawlessness had 
<A NAME="723"></A>he been Emperor himself; as it is, he has lorded it over us as if we had 
<A NAME="724"></A>been his own subjects, has held us as cheap as if we had been another's. 
<A NAME="725"></A>That one house would furnish the donative, which is never given you, but 
<A NAME="726"></A>with which you are daily upbraided.
<A NAME="727"></A><BR><BR>"Again, that we might have nothing to hope even from his successor, 
<A NAME="728"></A>Galba fetches out of exile the man in whose ill-humour and avarice he considers 
<A NAME="729"></A>that he has found the best resemblance to himself. You witnessed, comrades, 
<A NAME="730"></A>how by a remarkable storm even the Gods discountenanced that ill-starred 
<A NAME="731"></A>adoption; and the feeling of the Senate, of the people of Rome, is the 
<A NAME="732"></A>same. It is to your valour that they look, in you these better counsels 
<A NAME="733"></A>find all their support, without you, noble as they may be, they are powerless. 
<A NAME="734"></A>It is not to war or to danger that I invite you; the swords of all Roman 
<A NAME="735"></A>soldiers are with us. At this moment Galba has but one half-armed cohort, 
<A NAME="736"></A>which is detaining, not defending him. Let it once behold you, let it receive 
<A NAME="737"></A>my signal, and the only strife will be, who shall oblige me most. There 
<A NAME="738"></A>is no room for delay in a business which can only be approved when it is 
<A NAME="739"></A>done." He then ordered the armoury to be opened. The soldiers immediately 
<A NAME="740"></A>seized the arms without regard to rule or military order, no distinction 
<A NAME="741"></A>being observed between Praetorians and legionaries, both of whom again 
<A NAME="742"></A>indiscriminately assumed the shields and helmets of the auxiliary troops. 
<A NAME="743"></A>No tribune or centurion encouraged them, every man acted on his own impulse 
<A NAME="744"></A>and guidance, and the vilest found their chief incitement in the dejection 
<A NAME="745"></A>of the good.
<A NAME="746"></A><BR><BR>Meanwhile, appalled by the roar of the increasing sedition and 
<A NAME="747"></A>by the shouts which reached the city, Piso had overtaken Galba, who in 
<A NAME="748"></A>the interval had quitted the palace, and was approaching the Forum. Already 
<A NAME="749"></A>Marius Celsus had brought back discouraging tidings. And now some advised 
<A NAME="750"></A>that the Emperor should return to the palace, others that he should make 
<A NAME="751"></A>for the Capitol, many again that he should occupy the Rostra, though most 
<A NAME="752"></A>did but oppose the opinions of others, while, as ever happens in these 
<A NAME="753"></A>ill-starred counsels, plans for which the opportunity had slipped away 
<A NAME="754"></A>seemed the best. It is said that Laco, without Galba's knowledge, meditated 
<A NAME="755"></A>the death of Vinius, either hoping by this execution to appease the fury 
<A NAME="756"></A>of the soldiers, or believing him to be an accomplice of Otho, or, it may 
<A NAME="757"></A>be, out of mere hatred. The time and the place however made him hesitate; 
<A NAME="758"></A>he knew that a massacre once begun is not easily checked. His plan too 
<A NAME="759"></A>was disconcerted by a succession of alarming tidings, and the desertion 
<A NAME="760"></A>of immediate adherents. So languid was now the zeal of those who had at 
<A NAME="761"></A>first been eager to display their fidelity and courage.
<A NAME="762"></A><BR><BR>Galba was hurried to and fro with every movement of the surging 
<A NAME="763"></A>crowd; the halls and temples all around were thronged with spectators of 
<A NAME="764"></A>this mournful sight. Not a voice was heard from the people or even from 
<A NAME="765"></A>the rabble. Everywhere were terror-stricken countenances, and ears turned 
<A NAME="766"></A>to catch every sound. It was a scene neither of agitation nor of repose, 
<A NAME="767"></A>but there reigned the silence of profound alarm and profound indignation. 
<A NAME="768"></A>Otho however was told that they were arming the mob. He ordered his men 
<A NAME="769"></A>to hurry on at full speed, and to anticipate the danger. Then did Roman 
<A NAME="770"></A>soldiers rush forward like men who had to drive a Vologeses or Pacorus 
<A NAME="771"></A>from the ancestral throne of the Arsacidae, not as though they were hastening 
<A NAME="772"></A>to murder their aged and defenceless Emperor. In all the terror of their 
<A NAME="773"></A>arms, and at the full speed of their horses, they burst into the Forum, 
<A NAME="774"></A>thrusting aside the crowd and trampling on the Senate. Neither the sight 
<A NAME="775"></A>of the Capitol, nor the sanctity of the overhanging temples, nor the thought 
<A NAME="776"></A>of rulers past or future, could deter them from committing a crime, which 
<A NAME="777"></A>any one succeeding to power must avenge.
<A NAME="778"></A><BR><BR>When this armed array was seen to approach, the standard-bearer 
<A NAME="779"></A>of the cohort that escorted Galba (he is said to have been one Atilius 
<A NAME="780"></A>Vergilio) tore off and dashed upon the ground Galba's effigy. At this signal 
<A NAME="781"></A>the feeling of all the troops declared itself plainly for Otho. The Forum 
<A NAME="782"></A>was deserted by the flying populace. Weapons were pointed against all who 
<A NAME="783"></A>hesitated. Near the lake of Curtius, Galba was thrown out of his litter 
<A NAME="784"></A>and fell to the ground, through the alarm of his bearers. His last words 
<A NAME="785"></A>have been variously reported according as men hated or admired him. Some 
<A NAME="786"></A>have said that he asked in a tone of entreaty what wrong he had done, and 
<A NAME="787"></A>begged a few days for the payment of the donative. The more general account 
<A NAME="788"></A>is, that he voluntarily offered his neck to the murderers, and bade them 
<A NAME="789"></A>haste and strike, if it seemed to be for the good of the Commonwealth. 
<A NAME="790"></A>To those who slew him mattered not what he said. About the actual murderer 
<A NAME="791"></A>nothing is clearly known. Some have recorded the name of Terentius, an 
<A NAME="792"></A>enrolled pensioner, others that of Lecanius; but it is the current report 
<A NAME="793"></A>that one Camurius, a soldier of the 15th legion, completely severed his 
<A NAME="794"></A>throat by treading his sword down upon it. The rest of the soldiers foully 
<A NAME="795"></A>mutilated his arms and legs, for his breast was protected, and in their 
<A NAME="796"></A>savage ferocity inflicted many wounds even on the headless 
<A NAME="797"></A>trunk.
<A NAME="798"></A><BR><BR>They next fell on T. Vinius; and in his case also it is not known 
<A NAME="799"></A>whether the fear of instant death choked his utterance, or whether he cried 
<A NAME="800"></A>out that Otho had not given orders to slay him. Either he invented this 
<A NAME="801"></A>in his terror, or he thus confessed his share in the conspiracy. His life 
<A NAME="802"></A>and character incline us rather to believe that he was an accomplice in 
<A NAME="803"></A>the crime which he certainly caused. He fell in front of the temple of 
<A NAME="804"></A>the Divine Julius, and at the first blow, which struck him on the back 
<A NAME="805"></A>of the knee; immediately afterwards Julius Carus, a legionary, ran him 
<A NAME="806"></A>through the body.
<A NAME="807"></A><BR><BR>A noble example of manhood was on that day witnessed by our age 
<A NAME="808"></A>in Sempronius Densus. He was a centurion in a cohort of the Praetorian 
<A NAME="809"></A>Guard, and had been appointed by Galba to escort Piso. Rushing, dagger 
<A NAME="810"></A>in hand, to meet the armed men, and upbraiding them with their crime, he 
<A NAME="811"></A>drew the attention of the murderers on himself by his exclamations and 
<A NAME="812"></A>gestures, and thus gave Piso, wounded as he was, an opportunity of escape. 
<A NAME="813"></A>Piso made his way to the temple of Vesta, where he was admitted by the 
<A NAME="814"></A>compassion of one of the public slaves, who concealed him in his chamber. 
<A NAME="815"></A>There, not indeed through the sanctity of the place or its worship, but 
<A NAME="816"></A>through the obscurity of his hiding-place, he obtained a respite from instant 
<A NAME="817"></A>destruction, till there came, by Otho's direction and specially eager to 
<A NAME="818"></A>slay him, Sulpicius Florus, of the British auxiliary infantry, to whom 
<A NAME="819"></A>Galba had lately given the citizenship, and Statius Murcus, one of the 
<A NAME="820"></A>body-guard. Piso was dragged out by these men and slaughtered in the entrance 
<A NAME="821"></A>of the temple.
<A NAME="822"></A><BR><BR>There was, we are told, no death of which Otho heard with greater 
<A NAME="823"></A>joy, no head which he surveyed with so insatiable a gaze. Perhaps it was, 
<A NAME="824"></A>that his mind was then for the first time relieved from all anxiety, and 
<A NAME="825"></A>so had leisure to rejoice; perhaps there was with Galba something to recall 
<A NAME="826"></A>departed majesty, with Vinius some thought of old friendship, which troubled 
<A NAME="827"></A>with mournful images even that ruthless heart; Piso's death, as that of 
<A NAME="828"></A>an enemy and a rival, he felt to be a right and lawful subject of rejoicing. 
<A NAME="829"></A>The heads were fixed upon poles and carried about among the standards of 
<A NAME="830"></A>the cohorts, close to the eagle of the legion, while those who had struck 
<A NAME="831"></A>the blow, those who had been present, those who whether truly or falsely 
<A NAME="832"></A>boasted of the act, as of some great and memorable achievement, vied in 
<A NAME="833"></A>displaying their bloodstained hands. Vitellius afterwards found more than 
<A NAME="834"></A>120 memorials from persons who claimed a reward for some notable service 
<A NAME="835"></A>on that day. All these persons he ordered to be sought out and slain, not 
<A NAME="836"></A>to honour Galba, but to comply with the traditional policy of rulers, who 
<A NAME="837"></A>thus provide protection for the present and vengeance for the 
<A NAME="838"></A>future.
<A NAME="839"></A><BR><BR>One would have thought it a different Senate, a different people. 
<A NAME="840"></A>All rushed to the camp, outran those who were close to them, and struggled 
<A NAME="841"></A>with those who were before, inveighed against Galba, praised the wisdom 
<A NAME="842"></A>of the soldiers, covered the hand of Otho with kisses; the more insincere 
<A NAME="843"></A>their demonstrations, the more they multiplied them. Nor did Otho repulse 
<A NAME="844"></A>the advances of individuals, while he checked the greed and ferocity of 
<A NAME="845"></A>the soldiers by word and look. They demanded that Marius Celsus, consul 
<A NAME="846"></A>elect, Galba's faithful friend to the very last moment, should be led to 
<A NAME="847"></A>execution, loathing his energy and integrity as if they were vices. It 
<A NAME="848"></A>was evident that they were seeking to begin massacre and plunder, and the 
<A NAME="849"></A>proscription of all the most virtuous citizens, and Otho had not yet sufficient 
<A NAME="850"></A>authority to prevent crime, though he could command it. He feigned anger, 
<A NAME="851"></A>and ordered him to be loaded with chains, declaring that he was to suffer 
<A NAME="852"></A>more signal punishment, and thus he rescued him from immediate 
<A NAME="853"></A>destruction.
<A NAME="854"></A><BR><BR>Every thing was then ordered according to the will of the soldiery. 
<A NAME="855"></A>The Praetorians chose their own prefects. One was Plotius Firmus, who had 
<A NAME="856"></A>once been in the ranks, had afterwards commanded the watch, and who, while 
<A NAME="857"></A>Galba was yet alive, had embraced the cause of Otho. With him was associated 
<A NAME="858"></A>Licinius Proculus, Otho's intimate friend, and consequently suspected of 
<A NAME="859"></A>having encouraged his schemes. Flavius Sabinus they appointed prefect of 
<A NAME="860"></A>the city, thus adopting Nero's choice, in whose reign he had held the same 
<A NAME="861"></A>office, though many in choosing him had an eye to his brother Vespasian. 
<A NAME="862"></A>A demand was then made, that the fees for furloughs usually paid to the 
<A NAME="863"></A>centurions should be abolished. These the common soldiers paid as a kind 
<A NAME="864"></A>of annual tribute. A fourth part of every company might be scattered on 
<A NAME="865"></A>furlough, or even loiter about the camp, provided that they paid the fees 
<A NAME="866"></A>to the centurions. No one cared about the amount of the tax, or the way 
<A NAME="867"></A>in which it was raised. It was by robbery, plunder, or the most servile 
<A NAME="868"></A>occupations that the soldiers' holiday was purchased. The man with the 
<A NAME="869"></A>fullest purse was worn out with toil and cruel usage till he bought his 
<A NAME="870"></A>furlough. His means exhausted by this outlay, and his energies utterly 
<A NAME="871"></A>relaxed by idleness, the once rich and vigorous soldier returned to his 
<A NAME="872"></A>company a poor and spiritless man. One after another was ruined by the 
<A NAME="873"></A>same poverty and license, and rushed into mutiny and dissension, and finally 
<A NAME="874"></A>into civil war. Otho, however, not to alienate the affections of the centurions 
<A NAME="875"></A>by an act of bounty to the ranks, promised that his own purse should pay 
<A NAME="876"></A>these annual sums. It was undoubtedly a salutary reform, and was afterwards 
<A NAME="877"></A>under good emperors established as a permanent rule of the service. Laco, 
<A NAME="878"></A>prefect of the city, who had been ostensibly banished to an island, was 
<A NAME="879"></A>assassinated by an enrolled pensioner, sent on by Otho to do the deed. 
<A NAME="880"></A>Martianus Icelus, being but a freedman, was publicly 
<A NAME="881"></A>executed.
<A NAME="882"></A><BR><BR>A day spent in crime found its last horror in the rejoicings that 
<A NAME="883"></A>concluded it. The Praetor of the city summoned the Senate; the rest of 
<A NAME="884"></A>the Magistrates vied with each other in their flatteries. The Senators 
<A NAME="885"></A>hastily assembled and conferred by decree upon Otho the tribunitial office, 
<A NAME="886"></A>the name of Augustus, and every imperial honour. All strove to extinguish 
<A NAME="887"></A>the remembrance of those taunts and invectives, which had been thrown out 
<A NAME="888"></A>at random, and which no one supposed were rankling in his heart. Whether 
<A NAME="889"></A>he had forgotten, or only postponed his resentment, the shortness of his 
<A NAME="890"></A>reign left undecided. The Forum yet streamed with blood, when he was borne 
<A NAME="891"></A>in a litter over heaps of dead to the Capitol, and thence to the palace. 
<A NAME="892"></A>He suffered the bodies to be given up for burial, and to be burnt. For 
<A NAME="893"></A>Piso, the last rites were performed by his wife Verania and his brother 
<A NAME="894"></A>Scribonianus; for Vinius, by his daughter Crispina, their heads having 
<A NAME="895"></A>been discovered and purchased from the murderers, who had reserved them 
<A NAME="896"></A>for sale.
<A NAME="897"></A><BR><BR>Piso, who was then completing his thirty-first year, had enjoyed 
<A NAME="898"></A>more fame than good fortune. His brothers, Magnus and Crassus, had been 
<A NAME="899"></A>put to death by Claudius and Nero respectively. He was himself for many 
<A NAME="900"></A>years an exile, for four days a Caesar, and Galba's hurried adoption of 
<A NAME="901"></A>him only gave him this privilege over his elder brother, that he perished 
<A NAME="902"></A>first. Vinius had lived to the age of fifty-seven, with many changes of 
<A NAME="903"></A>character. His father was of a praetorian family, his maternal grandfather 
<A NAME="904"></A>was one of the proscribed. He had disgraced himself in his first campaign 
<A NAME="905"></A>when he served under the legate Calvisius Sabinus. That officer's wife, 
<A NAME="906"></A>urged by a perverse curiosity to view the camp, entered it by night in 
<A NAME="907"></A>the disguise of a soldier, and after extending the insulting frolic to 
<A NAME="908"></A>the watches and the general arrangements of the army, actually dared to 
<A NAME="909"></A>commit the act of adultery in the head-quarters. Vinius was charged with 
<A NAME="910"></A>having participated in her guilt, and by order of Caius was loaded with 
<A NAME="911"></A>irons. The altered times soon restored him to liberty. He then enjoyed 
<A NAME="912"></A>an uninterrupted succession of honours, first filling the praetorship, 
<A NAME="913"></A>and then commanding a legion with general satisfaction, but he subsequently 
<A NAME="914"></A>incurred the degrading imputation of having pilfered a gold cup at the 
<A NAME="915"></A>table of Claudius, who the next day directed that he alone should be served 
<A NAME="916"></A>on earthenware. Yet as proconsul of Gallia Narbonensis he administered 
<A NAME="917"></A>the government with strict integrity. When forced by his friendship with 
<A NAME="918"></A>Galba to a dangerous elevation, he shewed himself bold, crafty, and enterprising; 
<A NAME="919"></A>and whether he applied his powers to vice or virtue, was always equally 
<A NAME="920"></A>energetic. His will was made void by his vast wealth; that of Piso owed 
<A NAME="921"></A>its validity to his poverty.
<A NAME="922"></A><BR><BR>The body of Galba lay for a long time neglected, and subjected, 
<A NAME="923"></A>through the license which the darkness permitted, to a thousand indignities, 
<A NAME="924"></A>till Argius his steward, who had been one of his slaves, gave it a humble 
<A NAME="925"></A>burial in his master's private gardens. His head, which the sutlers and 
<A NAME="926"></A>camp-followers had fixed on a pole and mangled, was found only the next 
<A NAME="927"></A>day in front of the tomb of Patrobius, a freedman of Nero's, whom Galba 
<A NAME="928"></A>had executed. It was put with the body, which had by that time been reduced 
<A NAME="929"></A>to ashes. Such was the end of Servius Galba, who in his seventy-three years 
<A NAME="930"></A>had lived prosperously through the reigns of five Emperors, and had been 
<A NAME="931"></A>more fortunate under the rule of others than he was in his own. His family 
<A NAME="932"></A>could boast an ancient nobility, his wealth was great. His character was 
<A NAME="933"></A>of an average kind, rather free from vices, than distinguished by virtues. 
<A NAME="934"></A>He was not regardless of fame, nor yet vainly fond of it. Other men's money 
<A NAME="935"></A>he did not covet, with his own he was parsimonious, with that of the State 
<A NAME="936"></A>avaricious. To his freedmen and friends he shewed a forbearance, which, 
<A NAME="937"></A>when he had fallen into worthy hands, could not be blamed; when, however, 
<A NAME="938"></A>these persons were worthless, he was even culpably blind. The nobility 
<A NAME="939"></A>of his birth and the perils of the times made what was really indolence 
<A NAME="940"></A>pass for wisdom. While in the vigour of life, he enjoyed a high military 
<A NAME="941"></A>reputation in Germany; as proconsul he ruled Africa with moderation, and 
<A NAME="942"></A>when advanced in years shewed the same integrity in Eastern Spain. He seemed 
<A NAME="943"></A>greater than a subject while he was yet in a subject's rank, and by common 
<A NAME="944"></A>consent would have been pronounced equal to empire, had he never been 
<A NAME="945"></A>emperor.
<A NAME="946"></A><BR><BR>The alarm of the capital, which trembled to see the atrocity of 
<A NAME="947"></A>these recent crimes, and to think of the old character of Otho, was heightened 
<A NAME="948"></A>into terror by the fresh news about Vitellius, news which had been suppressed 
<A NAME="949"></A>before the murder of Galba, in order to make it appear that only the army 
<A NAME="950"></A>of Upper Germany had revolted. That two men, who for shamelessness, indolence, 
<A NAME="951"></A>and profligacy, were the most worthless of mortals, had been selected, 
<A NAME="952"></A>it would seem, by some fatality to ruin the Empire, became the open complaint, 
<A NAME="953"></A>not only of the Senate and the Knights, who had some stake and interest 
<A NAME="954"></A>in the country, but even of the common people. It was no longer to the 
<A NAME="955"></A>late horrors of a dreadful peace, but to the recollections of the civil 
<A NAME="956"></A>wars, that men recurred, speaking of how the capital had been taken by 
<A NAME="957"></A>Roman armies, how Italy had been wasted and the provinces spoiled, of Pharsalia, 
<A NAME="958"></A>Philippi, Perusia, and Mutina, and all the familiar names of great public 
<A NAME="959"></A>disasters. "The world," they said, "was well-nigh turned upside down when 
<A NAME="960"></A>the struggle for empire was between worthy competitors, yet the Empire 
<A NAME="961"></A>continued to exist after the victories of Caius Julius and Caesar Augustus; 
<A NAME="962"></A>the Republic would have continued to exist under Pompey and Brutus. And 
<A NAME="963"></A>is it for Otho or for Vitellius that we are now to repair to the temples? 
<A NAME="964"></A>Prayers for either would be impious, vows for either a blasphemy, when 
<A NAME="965"></A>from their conflict you can only learn that the conqueror must be the worse 
<A NAME="966"></A>of the two." Some were speculating on Vespasian and the armies of the East. 
<A NAME="967"></A>Vespasian was indeed preferable to either, yet they shuddered at the idea 
<A NAME="968"></A>of another war, of other massacres. Even about Vespasian there were doubtful 
<A NAME="969"></A>rumours, and he, unlike any of his predecessors, was changed for the better 
<A NAME="970"></A>by power.
<A NAME="971"></A><BR><BR>I will now describe the origin and occasion of the revolt of Vitellius. 
<A NAME="972"></A>After the destruction of Julius Vindex and his whole force, the army, flushed 
<A NAME="973"></A>with the delights of plunder and glory, as men might well be who had been 
<A NAME="974"></A>fortunate enough to triumph without toil or danger in a most lucrative 
<A NAME="975"></A>war, began to hanker after compaigns and battles, and to prefer prize money 
<A NAME="976"></A>to pay. They had long endured a service which the character of the country 
<A NAME="977"></A>and of the climate and the rigours of military discipline rendered at once 
<A NAME="978"></A>unprofitable and severe. But that discipline, inexorable as it is in times 
<A NAME="979"></A>of peace, is relaxed by civil strife, when on both sides are found the 
<A NAME="980"></A>agents of corruption, and treachery goes unpunished. They had men, arms 
<A NAME="981"></A>and horses, more than enough for all purposes of utility and show, but 
<A NAME="982"></A>before the war they had been acquainted only with the companies and squadrons 
<A NAME="983"></A>of their own force, as the various armies were separated from each other 
<A NAME="984"></A>by the limits of their respective provinces. But the legions, having been 
<A NAME="985"></A>concentrated to act against Vindex, and having thus learnt to measure their 
<A NAME="986"></A>own strength against the strength of Gaul, were now on the lookout for 
<A NAME="987"></A>another war and for new conflicts. They called their neighbours, not "allies" 
<A NAME="988"></A>as of old, but "the enemy" and "the vanquished." Nor did that part of Gaul 
<A NAME="989"></A>which borders on the Rhine fail to espouse the same cause, and to the bitterest 
<A NAME="990"></A>hostility in inflaming the army against the Galbianists, that being the 
<A NAME="991"></A>name, which in their contempt for Vindex they had given to the party. The 
<A NAME="992"></A>rage first excited against the Sequani and Aedui extended to other states 
<A NAME="993"></A>in proportion to their wealth, and they revelled in imagination on the 
<A NAME="994"></A>storm of cities, the plunder of estates, the sack of dwelling-houses. But, 
<A NAME="995"></A>besides the rapacity and arrogance which are the special faults of superior 
<A NAME="996"></A>strength, they were exasperated by the bravadoes of the Gallic people, 
<A NAME="997"></A>who in a spirit of insult to the army boasted of how they had been relieved 
<A NAME="998"></A>by Galba from a fourth part of their tribute, and had received grants from 
<A NAME="999"></A>the State. There was also a report, ingeniously spread and recklessly believed, 
<A NAME="1000"></A>to the effect that the legions were being decimated, and all the most energetic 
<A NAME="1001"></A>centurions dismissed. From all quarters arrived the most alarming tidings. 
<A NAME="1002"></A>The reports from the capital were unfavourable, while the disaffection 
<A NAME="1003"></A>of the colony of Lugdunum, which obstinately adhered to Nero, gave rise 
<A NAME="1004"></A>to a multitude of rumours. But it was in the army itself, in its hatreds, 
<A NAME="1005"></A>its fears, and even in the security with which a review of its own strength 
<A NAME="1006"></A>inspired it, that there was the most abundant material for the exercise 
<A NAME="1007"></A>of imagination and credulity.
<A NAME="1008"></A><BR><BR>Just before December 1 in the preceding year, Aulus Vitellius had 
<A NAME="1009"></A>visited Lower Germany, and had carefully inspected the winter quarters 
<A NAME="1010"></A>of the legions. Many had their rank restored to them, sentences of degradation 
<A NAME="1011"></A>were cancelled, and marks of disgrace partially removed. In most cases 
<A NAME="1012"></A>he did but court popularity, in some he exercised a sound discretion, making 
<A NAME="1013"></A>a salutary change from the meanness and rapacity which Fonteius Capito 
<A NAME="1014"></A>had shown in bestowing and withdrawing promotion. But he seemed a greater 
<A NAME="1015"></A>personage than a simple consular legate, and all his acts were invested 
<A NAME="1016"></A>with an unusual importance. Though sterner judges pronounced Vitellius 
<A NAME="1017"></A>to be a man of low tastes, those who were partial to him attributed to 
<A NAME="1018"></A>geniality and good nature the immoderate and indiscriminate prodigality, 
<A NAME="1019"></A>with which he gave away what was his own, and squandered what did not belong 
<A NAME="1020"></A>to him. Besides this, men themselves eager for power were ready to represent 
<A NAME="1021"></A>his very vices as virtues. As there were in both armies many of obedient 
<A NAME="1022"></A>and quiet habits, so there were many who were as unprincipled as they were 
<A NAME="1023"></A>energetic; but distinguished above all for boundless ambition and singular 
<A NAME="1024"></A>daring were the legates of the legions, Fabius Valens and Alienus Caecina. 
<A NAME="1025"></A>One of these men, Valens, had taken offence against Galba, under the notion 
<A NAME="1026"></A>that he had not shewn proper gratitude for his services in discovering 
<A NAME="1027"></A>to him the hesitation of Verginius and crushing the plans of Capito. He 
<A NAME="1028"></A>now began to urge Vitellius to action. He enlarged on the zeal of the soldiery. 
<A NAME="1029"></A>"You have," he said, "everywhere a great reputation; you will find nothing 
<A NAME="1030"></A>to stop you in Hordeonius Flaccus; Britain will be with you; the German 
<A NAME="1031"></A>auxiliaries will follow your standard. All the provinces waver in their 
<A NAME="1032"></A>allegiance. The Empire is held on the precarious tenure of an aged life, 
<A NAME="1033"></A>and must shortly pass into other hands. You have only to open your arms, 
<A NAME="1034"></A>and to meet the advances of fortune. It was well for Verginius to hesitate, 
<A NAME="1035"></A>the scion of a mere Equestrian family, and son of a father unknown to fame: 
<A NAME="1036"></A>he would have been unequal to empire, had he accepted it, and yet been 
<A NAME="1037"></A>safe though he refused it. But from the honours of a father who was thrice 
<A NAME="1038"></A>consul, was censor and colleague of Caesar, Vitellius has long since derived 
<A NAME="1039"></A>an imperial rank, while he has lost the security that belongs to a 
<A NAME="1040"></A>subject."
<A NAME="1041"></A><BR><BR>These arguments roused the indolent temper of the man, yet roused 
<A NAME="1042"></A>him rather to wish than to hope for the throne. Meanwhile however in Upper 
<A NAME="1043"></A>Germany Caecina, young and handsome, of commanding stature, and of boundless 
<A NAME="1044"></A>ambition, had attracted the favour of the soldiery by his skilful oratory 
<A NAME="1045"></A>and his dignified mien. This man had, when quaestor in Baetica, attached 
<A NAME="1046"></A>himself with zeal to the party of Galba, who had appointed him, young as 
<A NAME="1047"></A>he was, to the command of a legion, but, it being afterwards discovered 
<A NAME="1048"></A>that he had embezzled the public money, Galba directed that he should be 
<A NAME="1049"></A>prosecuted for peculation. Caecina, grievously offended, determined to 
<A NAME="1050"></A>throw everything into confusion, and under the disasters of his country 
<A NAME="1051"></A>to conceal his private dishonour. There were not wanting in the army itself 
<A NAME="1052"></A>the elements of civil strife. The whole of it had taken part in the war 
<A NAME="1053"></A>against Vindex; it had not passed over to Galba till Nero fell; even then 
<A NAME="1054"></A>in this transference of its allegiance it had been anticipated by the armies 
<A NAME="1055"></A>of Lower Germany. Besides this, the Treveri, the Lingones, and the other 
<A NAME="1056"></A>states which Galba had most seriously injured by his severe edicts and 
<A NAME="1057"></A>by the confiscation of their territory, were particularly close to the 
<A NAME="1058"></A>winter-quarters of the legions. Thence arose seditious conferences, a soldiery 
<A NAME="1059"></A>demoralized by intercourse with the inhabitants of the country, and tendencies 
<A NAME="1060"></A>in favour of Verginius, which could easily be to the profit of any other 
<A NAME="1061"></A>person.
<A NAME="1062"></A><BR><BR>The Lingones, following an old custom, had sent presents to the 
<A NAME="1063"></A>legions, right hands clasped together, an emblem of friendship. Their envoys, 
<A NAME="1064"></A>who had assumed a studied appearance of misery and distress, passed through 
<A NAME="1065"></A>the headquarters and the men's tents, and complaining, now of their own 
<A NAME="1066"></A>wrongs, now of the rewards bestowed on the neighbouring states, and, when 
<A NAME="1067"></A>they found the soldiers' ears open to their words, of the perils and insults 
<A NAME="1068"></A>to which the army itself was exposed, inflamed the passions of the troops. 
<A NAME="1069"></A>The legions were on the verge of mutiny, when Hordeonius Flaccus ordered 
<A NAME="1070"></A>the envoys to depart, and to make their departure more secret, directed 
<A NAME="1071"></A>them to leave the camp by night. Hence arose a frightful rumour, many asserting 
<A NAME="1072"></A>that the envoys had been killed, and that, unless the soldiers provided 
<A NAME="1073"></A>their own safety, the next thing would be, that the most energetic of their 
<A NAME="1074"></A>number, and those who had complained of their present condition, would 
<A NAME="1075"></A>be slaughtered under cover of night, when the rest of the army would know 
<A NAME="1076"></A>nothing of their fate. The legions then boun
