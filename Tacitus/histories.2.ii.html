<A NAME="start"></A>
<A NAME="10"></A>March - August, A.D. 69
<A NAME="11"></A><BR><BR>In A distant part of the world fortune was now preparing the origin 
<A NAME="12"></A>and rise of a new dynasty, whose varied destinies brought happiness or 
<A NAME="13"></A>misery on the State, prosperity or destruction on the Princes of its line. 
<A NAME="14"></A>Titus Vespasian had been sent from Judaea by his father while Galba still 
<A NAME="15"></A>lived, and alleged as a reason for his journey the homage due to the Emperor, 
<A NAME="16"></A>and his age, which now qualified him to compete for office. But the vulgar, 
<A NAME="17"></A>ever eager to invent, had spread the report that he was sent for to be 
<A NAME="18"></A>adopted. The advanced years and childless condition of the Emperor furnished 
<A NAME="19"></A>matter for such gossip, and the country never can refrain from naming many 
<A NAME="20"></A>persons until one be chosen. The report gained the more credit from the 
<A NAME="21"></A>genius of Titus himself, equal as it was to the most exalted fortune, from 
<A NAME="22"></A>the mingled beauty and majesty of his countenance, from the prosperous 
<A NAME="23"></A>fortunes of Vespasian, from the prophetic responses of oracles, and even 
<A NAME="24"></A>from accidental occurrences which, in the general disposition to belief, 
<A NAME="25"></A>were accepted as omens. At Corinth, the capital of Achaia, he received 
<A NAME="26"></A>positive information of the death of Galba, and found men who spoke confidently 
<A NAME="27"></A>of the revolt of Vitellius and of the fact of war. In the anxiety of his 
<A NAME="28"></A>mind, he sent a few of his friends, and carefully surveyed his position 
<A NAME="29"></A>from both points of view. He considered that if he should proceed to Rome, 
<A NAME="30"></A>he should get no thanks for a civility intended for another, while his 
<A NAME="31"></A>person would be a hostage in the hands either of Vitellius or of Otho; 
<A NAME="32"></A>that should he turn back, the conqueror would certainly be offended, but 
<A NAME="33"></A>with the issue of the struggle still doubtful, and the father joining the 
<A NAME="34"></A>party, the son would be excused; on the other hand, if Vespasian should 
<A NAME="35"></A>assume the direction of the state, men who had to think of war would have 
<A NAME="36"></A>to forget such causes of offence.
<A NAME="37"></A><BR><BR>These and like thoughts made him waver between hope and fear; but 
<A NAME="38"></A>hope triumphed. Some supposed that he retraced his steps for love of Queen 
<A NAME="39"></A>Berenice, nor was his young heart averse to her charms, but this affection 
<A NAME="40"></A>occasioned no hindrance to action. He passed, it is true, a youth enlivened 
<A NAME="41"></A>by pleasure, and practised more self-restraint in his own than in his father's 
<A NAME="42"></A>reign. So, after coasting Achaia and Asia, leaving the land on his left, 
<A NAME="43"></A>he made for the islands of Rhodes and Cyprus, and then by a bolder course 
<A NAME="44"></A>for Syria. Here he conceived a desire to visit and inspect the temple of 
<A NAME="45"></A>the Paphian Venus, place of celebrity both among natives and foreigners. 
<A NAME="46"></A>It will not be a tedious digression to record briefly the origin of the 
<A NAME="47"></A>worship, the ceremonial of the temple, and the form under which the goddess 
<A NAME="48"></A>is adored, a form found in no other place.
<A NAME="49"></A><BR><BR>The founder of the temple, according to old tradition, was king 
<A NAME="50"></A>Aerias, though some represent this as the name of the goddess herself. 
<A NAME="51"></A>Later accounts tell us that the temple was consecrated by Cinyras, and 
<A NAME="52"></A>that the goddess herself after her birth from the sea was wafted to this 
<A NAME="53"></A>spot, but that the wisdom and craft of the diviners was a foreign importation 
<A NAME="54"></A>introduced by Tamiras of Cilicia; and that it was agreed that the descendants 
<A NAME="55"></A>of both families should preside over the worship. Afterwards, that the 
<A NAME="56"></A>royal family might not be without some superiority over the foreign stock, 
<A NAME="57"></A>the strangers relinquished the craft which they had themselves introduced. 
<A NAME="58"></A>The priest of the line of Cinyras is alone consulted. The victims are such 
<A NAME="59"></A>as each worshipper has vowed, but males are selected; the surest prognostics 
<A NAME="60"></A>are seen in the entrails of kids. It is forbidden to pour blood on the 
<A NAME="61"></A>altar; the place of sacrifice is served only with prayers and pure flame, 
<A NAME="62"></A>and though it stands in the open air, it is never wet with rain. The image 
<A NAME="63"></A>of the goddess does not bear the human shape; it is a rounded mass rising 
<A NAME="64"></A>like a cone from a broad base to a small circumference. The meaning of 
<A NAME="65"></A>this is doubtful.
<A NAME="66"></A><BR><BR>Titus, after surveying the treasures, the royal presents, and the 
<A NAME="67"></A>other objects which the antiquarian tendencies of the Greek arbitrarily 
<A NAME="68"></A>connect with some uncertain past, first consulted the oracle about his 
<A NAME="69"></A>voyage. Receiving an answer that the way was open and the sea propitious, 
<A NAME="70"></A>he then, after sacrificing a number of victims, asked some questions in 
<A NAME="71"></A>ambiguous phrase concerning himself. Sostratus (that was the name of the 
<A NAME="72"></A>priest) seeing that the entrails presented an uniformly favourable appearance, 
<A NAME="73"></A>and that the goddess signified her favour to some great enterprise, returned 
<A NAME="74"></A>at the moment a brief and ordinary answer, but afterwards soliciting a 
<A NAME="75"></A>private interview, disclosed the future. His spirits raised, Titus rejoined 
<A NAME="76"></A>his father, and was received as a mighty pledge of success by the wavering 
<A NAME="77"></A>minds of the provincials and the troops. Vespasian had all but completed 
<A NAME="78"></A>the Jewish war, and only the siege of Jerusalem now remained, an operation, 
<A NAME="79"></A>the difficulty and arduousness of which was due, rather to the character 
<A NAME="80"></A>of its mountain citadel and the perverse obstinacy of the national superstition, 
<A NAME="81"></A>than to any sufficient means of enduring extremities left to the besieged. 
<A NAME="82"></A>As we have mentioned above, Vespasian himself had three legions inured 
<A NAME="83"></A>to war. Mucianus had four under his command in his peaceful province. Emulation, 
<A NAME="84"></A>however, and the glory won by the neighbouring army had banished all tendency 
<A NAME="85"></A>to sloth, and unbroken rest and exemption from the hardships of war had 
<A NAME="86"></A>given them a vigour equivalent to the hardihood which the others had gained 
<A NAME="87"></A>by their perils and their toils. Each had auxiliary forces of infantry 
<A NAME="88"></A>and cavalry, each had fleets and tributary kings, and each, though their 
<A NAME="89"></A>renown was of a different kind, had a celebrated name.
<A NAME="90"></A><BR><BR>Vespasian was an energetic soldier; he could march at the head 
<A NAME="91"></A>of his army, choose the place for his camp, and bring by night and day 
<A NAME="92"></A>his skill, or, if the occasion required, his personal courage to oppose 
<A NAME="93"></A>the foe. His food was such as chance offered; his dress and appearance 
<A NAME="94"></A>hardly distinguished him from the common soldier; in short, but for his 
<A NAME="95"></A>avarice, he was equal to the generals of old. Mucianus, on the contrary, 
<A NAME="96"></A>was eminent for his magnificence, for his wealth, and for a greatness that 
<A NAME="97"></A>transcended in all respects the condition of a subject; readier of speech 
<A NAME="98"></A>than the other, he thoroughly understood the arrangement and direction 
<A NAME="99"></A>of civil business. It would have been a rare combination of princely qualities, 
<A NAME="100"></A>if, with their respective faults removed, their virtues only could have 
<A NAME="101"></A>been united in one man. Mucianus was governor of Syria, Vespasian of Judaea. 
<A NAME="102"></A>In the administration of these neighbouring provinces jealousy had produced 
<A NAME="103"></A>discord between them, but on Nero's fall they had dropped their animosities 
<A NAME="104"></A>and associated their counsels. At first they communicated through friends, 
<A NAME="105"></A>till Titus, who was the great bond of union between them, by representing 
<A NAME="106"></A>their common interests had terminated their mischievous feud. He was indeed 
<A NAME="107"></A>a man formed both by nature and by education to attract even such a character 
<A NAME="108"></A>as that of Mucianus. The tribunes, the centurions, and the common soldiers, 
<A NAME="109"></A>were brought over to the cause by appeals to their energy or their love 
<A NAME="110"></A>of license, to their virtues or to their vices, according to their different 
<A NAME="111"></A>dispositions.
<A NAME="112"></A><BR><BR>Long before the arrival of Titus, both armies had taken the oath 
<A NAME="113"></A>of allegiance to Otho. The news had come, as is usual, with great speed, 
<A NAME="114"></A>while there was much to delay the gigantic undertaking of a civil war, 
<A NAME="115"></A>for which the East after a long period of repose was then for the first 
<A NAME="116"></A>time preparing. In former times the mightiest civil conflicts had been 
<A NAME="117"></A>begun in Gaul or Italy with the resources of the West. Pompey, Brutus, 
<A NAME="118"></A>Cassius, and Antony, all of whom had been followed across the sea by civil 
<A NAME="119"></A>war, had met with a disastrous end, and the Emperors had been oftener heard 
<A NAME="120"></A>of than seen in Syria and Judaea. There had been no mutiny among the legions, 
<A NAME="121"></A>nothing indeed but some demonstrations against the Parthians, attended 
<A NAME="122"></A>with various success. In the last civil war, though other provinces had 
<A NAME="123"></A>been disturbed, peace had been here unshaken. Then had followed a loyal 
<A NAME="124"></A>adherence to Galba. But when it became notorious that Otho and Vitellius, 
<A NAME="125"></A>opposed in impious strife, were ready to make a spoil of the Empire, the 
<A NAME="126"></A>thought that others would engross the rewards of power, while they would 
<A NAME="127"></A>have nothing left for themselves but a compulsory submission, made the 
<A NAME="128"></A>soldiers murmur and take a survey of their own strength. There were close 
<A NAME="129"></A>at hand seven legions; there were Syria and Judaea, with a vast number 
<A NAME="130"></A>of auxiliaries. Then, without any interval of separation, there was Egypt 
<A NAME="131"></A>and its two legions, and on the other side Cappadocia, Pontus, and all 
<A NAME="132"></A>the garrisons along the frontier of Armenia. There was Asia Minor; there 
<A NAME="133"></A>were the other provinces, not without a military population, and well furnished 
<A NAME="134"></A>with money. There were all the islands of the Mediterranean. And there 
<A NAME="135"></A>was the sea itself, which during the interval of preparation for war would 
<A NAME="136"></A>be both a convenience and a protection.
<A NAME="137"></A><BR><BR>The ardour of the troops was not unknown to their generals; but 
<A NAME="138"></A>it was judged advisable to wait for the issue of the struggle which others 
<A NAME="139"></A>were carrying on. The conquerors and the conquered, it was said, never 
<A NAME="140"></A>unite with a genuine good faith. It matters not whether fortune make Otho 
<A NAME="141"></A>or Vitellius to be the victor. Even great generals grow insolent in prosperity; 
<A NAME="142"></A>these men are quarrelsome, indolent, and profligate, and their own faults 
<A NAME="143"></A>will make war fatal to the one, and success to the other. They therefore 
<A NAME="144"></A>postponed the war until a more fitting opportunity, and though Vespasian 
<A NAME="145"></A>and Mucianus had but lately resolved on concerted action, the others had 
<A NAME="146"></A>done so long before. The worthiest among them were moved by patriotism; 
<A NAME="147"></A>many were wrought upon by the attractions of plunder; some by their private 
<A NAME="148"></A>embarrassments. And so, good and bad, from different motives, but with 
<A NAME="149"></A>equal zeal, were all eager for war.
<A NAME="150"></A><BR><BR>About this time Achaia and Asia Minor were terrified by a false 
<A NAME="151"></A>report that Nero was at hand. Various rumours were current about his death; 
<A NAME="152"></A>and so there were many who pretended and believed that he was still alive. 
<A NAME="153"></A>The adventures and enterprises of the other pretenders I shall relate in 
<A NAME="154"></A>the regular course of my work. The pretender in this case was a slave from 
<A NAME="155"></A>Pontus, or, according to some accounts, a freedman from Italy, a skilful 
<A NAME="156"></A>harp-player and singer, accomplishments, which, added to a resemblance 
<A NAME="157"></A>in the face, gave a very deceptive plausibility to his pretensions. After 
<A NAME="158"></A>attaching to himself some deserters, needy vagrants whom he bribed with 
<A NAME="159"></A>great offers, he put to sea. Driven by stress of weather to the island 
<A NAME="160"></A>of Cythnus, he induced certain soldiers, who were on their way from the 
<A NAME="161"></A>East, to join him, and ordered others, who refused, to be executed. He 
<A NAME="162"></A>also robbed the traders and armed all the most able bodied of the slaves. 
<A NAME="163"></A>The centurion Sisenna, who was the bearer of the clasped right hands, the 
<A NAME="164"></A>usual emblems of friendship, from the armies of Syria to the Praetorians, 
<A NAME="165"></A>was assailed by him with various artifices, till he left the island secretly, 
<A NAME="166"></A>and, fearing actual violence, made his escape with all haste. Thence the 
<A NAME="167"></A>alarm spread far and wide, and many roused themselves at the well-known 
<A NAME="168"></A>name, eager for change, and detesting the present state of things. The 
<A NAME="169"></A>report was daily gaining credit when an accident put an end to 
<A NAME="170"></A>it.
<A NAME="171"></A><BR><BR>Galba had entrusted the government of Galatia and Pamphylia to 
<A NAME="172"></A>Calpurnius Asprenas. Two triremes from the fleet of Misenum were given 
<A NAME="173"></A>him to pursue the adventurer: with these he reached the island of Cythnus. 
<A NAME="174"></A>Persons were found to summon the captains in the name of Nero. The pretender 
<A NAME="175"></A>himself, assuming a studied appearance of sorrow, and appealing to their 
<A NAME="176"></A>fidelity as old soldiers of his own, besought them to land him in Egypt 
<A NAME="177"></A>or Syria. The captains, perhaps wavering, perhaps intending to deceive, 
<A NAME="178"></A>declared that they must address their soldiers, and that they would return 
<A NAME="179"></A>when the minds of all had been prepared. Everything, however, was faithfully 
<A NAME="180"></A>reported to Asprenas, and at his bidding the ship was boarded and taken, 
<A NAME="181"></A>and the man, whoever he was, killed. The body, in which the eyes, the hair, 
<A NAME="182"></A>and the savage countenance, were remarkable features, was conveyed to Asia, 
<A NAME="183"></A>and thence to Rome.
<A NAME="184"></A><BR><BR>In a state that was distracted by strife, and that from frequent 
<A NAME="185"></A>changes in its rulers trembled on the verge between liberty and licence, 
<A NAME="186"></A>even little matters were attended with great excitement. Vibius Crispus, 
<A NAME="187"></A>whose wealth, power, and ability, made him rank among men of distinction, 
<A NAME="188"></A>rather than among men of worth, demanded that Annius Faustus, of the Equestrian 
<A NAME="189"></A>order, who in the days of Nero had practised the trade of the informer, 
<A NAME="190"></A>should be brought to trial before the Senate. The Senators indeed had recently, 
<A NAME="191"></A>during the reign of Galba, passed a resolution, that cognizance should 
<A NAME="192"></A>be taken of the cases of the informers. This decree was variously carried 
<A NAME="193"></A>out, and, while retained as law, was powerless or effectual, according 
<A NAME="194"></A>as the person, who happened to be accused, was influential or helpless. 
<A NAME="195"></A>Besides the terror of the law, Crispus had exerted his own power to the 
<A NAME="196"></A>utmost to destroy the man who had informed against his brother. He had 
<A NAME="197"></A>prevailed upon a great part of the Senate to demand that he should be consigned 
<A NAME="198"></A>to destruction, undefended and unheard. But, on the other hand, there were 
<A NAME="199"></A>some with whom nothing helped the accused person so much as the excessive 
<A NAME="200"></A>power of the accuser. They gave it as their opinion, that time ought to 
<A NAME="201"></A>be allowed, that the charges ought to be specified, that, odious and guilty 
<A NAME="202"></A>as the man might be, he yet ought to be heard, as precedent required. At 
<A NAME="203"></A>first they carried their point, and the trial was postponed for a few days, 
<A NAME="204"></A>but before long Faustus was condemned, but by no means with that unanimity 
<A NAME="205"></A>on the part of the people which his detestable character had deserved. 
<A NAME="206"></A>Men remembered that Crispus had followed the same profession with profit; 
<A NAME="207"></A>nor was it the penalty but the prosecutor that they 
<A NAME="208"></A>disliked.
<A NAME="209"></A><BR><BR>Meanwhile the campaign had opened favourably for Otho, at whose 
<A NAME="210"></A>bidding the armies of Dalmatia and Pannonia had begun to move. These comprised 
<A NAME="211"></A>four legions, from each of which two thousand troops were sent on in advance. 
<A NAME="212"></A>The 7th had been raised by Galba, the 11th, 13th, and 14th were veteran 
<A NAME="213"></A>soldiers, the 14th having particularly distinguished itself by quelling 
<A NAME="214"></A>the revolt in Britain. Nero had added to their reputation by selecting 
<A NAME="215"></A>them as his most effective troops. This had made them long faithful to 
<A NAME="216"></A>Nero, and kindled their zeal for Otho. But their self-confidence induced 
<A NAME="217"></A>a tardiness of movement proportionate to their strength and solidity. The 
<A NAME="218"></A>auxiliary infantry and cavalry moved in advance of the main body of the 
<A NAME="219"></A>legions. The capital itself contributed no contemptible force, namely five 
<A NAME="220"></A>Praetorian cohorts, some troops of cavalry, and the first legion, and together 
<A NAME="221"></A>with these, 2000 gladiators, a disreputable kind of auxiliaries, but employed 
<A NAME="222"></A>throughout the civil wars even by strict disciplinarians. Annius Gallus 
<A NAME="223"></A>was put at the head of this force, and was sent on with Vestricius Spurinna 
<A NAME="224"></A>to occupy the banks of the Padus, the original plan of the campaign having 
<A NAME="225"></A>fallen to the ground, now that Caecina, who they had hoped might have been 
<A NAME="226"></A>kept within the limits of Gaul, had crossed the Alps. Otho himself was 
<A NAME="227"></A>accompanied by some picked men of the body-guard, with whom were the rest 
<A NAME="228"></A>of the Praetorian cohorts, the veteran troops from the Praetorian camp, 
<A NAME="229"></A>and a vast number of the levies raised from the fleet. No indolence or 
<A NAME="230"></A>riot disgraced his march. He wore a cuirass of iron, and was to be seen 
<A NAME="231"></A>in front of the standards, on foot, rough and negligent in dress, and utterly 
<A NAME="232"></A>unlike what common report had pictured him.
<A NAME="233"></A><BR><BR>Fortune seemed to smile on his efforts. Through his fleets, which 
<A NAME="234"></A>commanded the sea, he held the greater part of Italy, even as far as where 
<A NAME="235"></A>the chain of the Maritime Alps begins. The task of attempting the passage 
<A NAME="236"></A>of this chain, and of advancing into the Provincia Narbonensis, he had 
<A NAME="237"></A>entrusted to three generals, Suedius Clemens, Antonius Novellus, and Aemilius 
<A NAME="238"></A>Pacensis. Pacensis, however, was put in irons by his insubordinate troops, 
<A NAME="239"></A>Antonius possessed no kind of authority, and Clemens commanded only for 
<A NAME="240"></A>popularity, and was as reckless in transgressing the good order of military 
<A NAME="241"></A>discipline as he was eager to fight. One would not have thought that it 
<A NAME="242"></A>was Italy, the fields, and the habitations of their native country, that 
<A NAME="243"></A>they were passing through. They burnt, spoiled, and plundered, as if they 
<A NAME="244"></A>were among the lands of the foreigner and the cities of a hostile people, 
<A NAME="245"></A>and all with the more frightful effect as nowhere had there been made any 
<A NAME="246"></A>provision against the danger. The fields were full of rural wealth, the 
<A NAME="247"></A>houses stood with open doors; and the owners, as with their wives and children 
<A NAME="248"></A>they came forth to meet the army, found themselves surrounded, in the midst 
<A NAME="249"></A>of the security of peace, with all the horrors of war. Marius Maturus was 
<A NAME="250"></A>then governing as procurator the province of the Maritime Alps. Raising 
<A NAME="251"></A>the population, in which is no lack of able-bodied men, he resolved to 
<A NAME="252"></A>drive back the Othonianists from the borders of his province; but the mountaineers 
<A NAME="253"></A>were cut down and broken by the first charge, as might be expected of men 
<A NAME="254"></A>who had been hastily collected, who were not familiar with camps or with 
<A NAME="255"></A>regular command, who saw no glory in victory, no infamy in 
<A NAME="256"></A>flight.
<A NAME="257"></A><BR><BR>Exasperated by this conflict, the troops of Otho vented their rage 
<A NAME="258"></A>on the town of Albintemilium. In the field indeed they had secured no plunder; 
<A NAME="259"></A>their rustic adversaries were poor, and their arms worthless; nor could 
<A NAME="260"></A>they be taken prisoners, for they were swift of foot, and knew the country 
<A NAME="261"></A>well. But the rapacity of the troops glutted itself in the ruin of an innocent 
<A NAME="262"></A>population. The horror of these acts was aggravated by a noble display 
<A NAME="263"></A>of fortitude in a Ligurian woman; she had concealed her son, and when the 
<A NAME="264"></A>soldiers, who believed that some money had been hidden with him, questioned 
<A NAME="265"></A>her with torture as to where she was hiding him, she pointed to her bosom, 
<A NAME="266"></A>and replied, "It is here that he is concealed"; nor could any subsequent 
<A NAME="267"></A>threats or even death itself make her falter in this courageous and noble 
<A NAME="268"></A>answer.
<A NAME="269"></A><BR><BR>Messengers now came in haste and alarm to inform Fabius Valens, 
<A NAME="270"></A>how Otho's fleet was threatening the province of Gallia Narbonensis, which 
<A NAME="271"></A>had sworn allegiance to Vitellius. Envoys from the colonies were already 
<A NAME="272"></A>on the spot praying for aid. He despatched two cohorts of Tungrian infantry, 
<A NAME="273"></A>four squadrons of horse, and all the cavalry of the Treviri under the command 
<A NAME="274"></A>of Julius Classicus. Part of these troops were retained for the defence 
<A NAME="275"></A>of the colony of Forum Julii, for it was feared, that if the whole army 
<A NAME="276"></A>were sent by the route through the interior, the enemy's fleet might make 
<A NAME="277"></A>a rapid movement on the unprotected coast. Twelve squadrons of cavalry 
<A NAME="278"></A>and some picked infantry advanced against the enemy; they were reinforced 
<A NAME="279"></A>by a cohort of Ligurians, an auxiliary local force of long standing, and 
<A NAME="280"></A>five hundred Pannonians, not yet regularly enrolled. The conflict commenced 
<A NAME="281"></A>without delay, the enemy's line of battle being so arranged, that part 
<A NAME="282"></A>of the levies from the fleet, who had a number of rustics among their ranks, 
<A NAME="283"></A>were posted on the slope of the hills which border on the coast, the Praetorians 
<A NAME="284"></A>fully occupying the level ground between the hills and the shore, while 
<A NAME="285"></A>on the sea was the fleet, moored to the land and ready for action, drawn 
<A NAME="286"></A>up in line so as to present a formidable front. The Vitellianists whose 
<A NAME="287"></A>infantry was inferior, but who were strong in cavalry, stationed the mountaineers 
<A NAME="288"></A>on the neighbouring heights, and their infantry in close ranks behind the 
<A NAME="289"></A>cavalry. The squadrons of the Treveri charged the enemy incautiously, and 
<A NAME="290"></A>found themselves encountered in front by the veteran troops, while on the 
<A NAME="291"></A>flanks they were also annoyed by showers of stones from the rustic band, 
<A NAME="292"></A>who were skilful throwers, and who, mixed up as they were among the regular 
<A NAME="293"></A>soldiers, whether cowardly or brave, were all equally bold in the moment 
<A NAME="294"></A>of victory. The general consternation of the Vitellianists was increased 
<A NAME="295"></A>by a new alarm as the fleet attacked the rear of the combatants. By this 
<A NAME="296"></A>movement they were hemmed in on all sides, and the whole force would have 
<A NAME="297"></A>perished, had not the shades of night checked the advance of the victorious 
<A NAME="298"></A>army, and covered the retreat of the vanquished.
<A NAME="299"></A><BR><BR>The Vitellianists, however, though beaten, did not remain inactive. 
<A NAME="300"></A>They brought up reinforcements and attacked the enemy, who felt themselves 
<A NAME="301"></A>secure, and whose vigilance was relaxed by success. The sentinels were 
<A NAME="302"></A>cut down, the camp stormed, and the panic reached the ships, till, as the 
<A NAME="303"></A>alarm gradually subsided, they again assumed the offensive under the protection 
<A NAME="304"></A>of some neighbouring heights which they had occupied. A terrible slaughter 
<A NAME="305"></A>ensued, and the prefects of the Tungrian cohorts, after having long maintained 
<A NAME="306"></A>their line unbroken, fell beneath a shower of missiles. The Othonianists, 
<A NAME="307"></A>however, did not achieve a bloodless victory, as the enemy's cavalry wheeled 
<A NAME="308"></A>round, and cut off some who had imprudently prolonged the pursuit. And 
<A NAME="309"></A>then, as if a sort of armistice had been concluded to provide against any 
<A NAME="310"></A>sudden panic that the cavalry of the one party or the fleet of the other 
<A NAME="311"></A>might cause, the Vitellianists retreated to Antipolis, a town of Gallia 
<A NAME="312"></A>Narbonensis, the Othonianists to Albigaunum, in Upper 
<A NAME="313"></A>Liguria.
<A NAME="314"></A><BR><BR>Corsica, Sardinia, and the other islands of the neighbouring seas, 
<A NAME="315"></A>were retained in the interests of Otho by the fame of these naval successes. 
<A NAME="316"></A>Corsica, however, all but suffered fatal injury from the rash proceedings 
<A NAME="317"></A>of Decumus Pacarius, the procurator, proceedings which in so gigantic a 
<A NAME="318"></A>war could contribute nothing to the general result, and which only brought 
<A NAME="319"></A>destruction upon their author. In his hatred of Otho he resolved to support 
<A NAME="320"></A>Vitellius with the whole strength of Corsica, an insignificant assistance 
<A NAME="321"></A>even had the design succeeded. He collected the chief men of the island, 
<A NAME="322"></A>and explained his plans. Claudius Pyrrhicus, captain of the Liburnian ships 
<A NAME="323"></A>stationed in the place, and Quintius Certus, a Roman knight, who ventured 
<A NAME="324"></A>to offer opposition, he ordered to execution. All who were present were 
<A NAME="325"></A>terrified at their death, and, with the ignorant populace, which ever blindly 
<A NAME="326"></A>shares in the fears of others, took the oath of allegiance to Vitellius. 
<A NAME="327"></A>But when Pacarius began to enlist troops, and to weary with military duties 
<A NAME="328"></A>an undisciplined population, disgusted with the unusual toil, they began 
<A NAME="329"></A>to reflect upon their own weakness. "The country which we inhabit," they 
<A NAME="330"></A>said to themselves, "is an island: Germany and its mighty legions are far 
<A NAME="331"></A>from us, and we know that even countries protected by infantry and cavalry 
<A NAME="332"></A>have been plundered and ravaged by the fleet." Their feelings underwent 
<A NAME="333"></A>a sudden change; they did not, however, resort to open violence, but chose 
<A NAME="334"></A>an opportunity for a treacherous attack. When the persons who usually surrounded 
<A NAME="335"></A>Pacarius had left him, and he was naked and helpless in the bath, they 
<A NAME="336"></A>slew him. His associates were slaughtered with him. The perpetrators of 
<A NAME="337"></A>the deed carried the heads of the slain to Otho, as being the heads of 
<A NAME="338"></A>public enemies; but, lost among the crowd of greater criminals, in the 
<A NAME="339"></A>vast confusion of events, they were neither rewarded by Otho nor punished 
<A NAME="340"></A>by Vitellius.
<A NAME="341"></A><BR><BR>Silius' Horse had now, as I have already related, opened the way 
<A NAME="342"></A>into Italy, and transferred the war across the borders. No one entertained 
<A NAME="343"></A>any attachment to Otho, yet it was not because they preferred Vitellius: 
<A NAME="344"></A>long years of peace had subdued them to any kind of servitude, had made 
<A NAME="345"></A>them ready to submit to the first comer and careless about the better cause. 
<A NAME="346"></A>The wealthiest district of Italy, the broad plains and cities which lie 
<A NAME="347"></A>between the Padus and the Alps, was now held by the troops of Vitellius; 
<A NAME="348"></A>for by this time the infantry sent on in advance by Caecina had also arrived. 
<A NAME="349"></A>A cohort of Pannonians had been taken prisoners at Cremona, a hundred cavalry, 
<A NAME="350"></A>and a thousand of the levies from the fleet intercepted between Placentia 
<A NAME="351"></A>and Ticinum. Elated by these successes the troops of Vitellius would no 
<A NAME="352"></A>longer be restrained by the boundaries of the river's bank. The very sight 
<A NAME="353"></A>of the Padus excited the men from Batavia and the Transrhenane provinces. 
<A NAME="354"></A>Crossing the stream by a sudden movement, they advanced on Placentia, and 
<A NAME="355"></A>seizing some reconnoiterers so terrified the rest, that, deceived by their 
<A NAME="356"></A>alarm, they announced that the whole army of Caecina was at 
<A NAME="357"></A>hand.
<A NAME="358"></A><BR><BR>Spurinna, who now held Placentia, was sure that Caecina had not 
<A NAME="359"></A>yet arrived, and that, even were he approaching, he ought to keep his men 
<A NAME="360"></A>within their fortifications, and not confront a veteran army with three 
<A NAME="361"></A>Praetorian cohorts, a thousand veterans, and a handful of cavalry. But 
<A NAME="362"></A>the undisciplined and inexperienced soldiery seized their standards and 
<A NAME="363"></A>colours, and rushed to the attack, brandishing their weapons in the face 
<A NAME="364"></A>of their general when he sought to restrain them, and spurning from them 
<A NAME="365"></A>the tribunes and centurions, and even crying out that Otho was betrayed 
<A NAME="366"></A>and that Caecina had come by invitation. Spurinna associated himself with 
<A NAME="367"></A>the rash movement which others had originated, at first acting under compulsion, 
<A NAME="368"></A>but afterwards pretending to consent, in the hope that his counsels might 
<A NAME="369"></A>have more influence should the mutinous spirit abate.
<A NAME="370"></A><BR><BR>When the Padus was in sight and night began to fall they judged 
<A NAME="371"></A>it expedient to entrench a camp. The labour, new as it was to the soldiery 
<A NAME="372"></A>of the capital, broke their spirits. All the oldest among them began to 
<A NAME="373"></A>inveigh against their own credulity, and to point out the difficulty and 
<A NAME="374"></A>danger of their position, if on those open plains Caecina and his army 
<A NAME="375"></A>were to surround their scanty forces. By this time more temperate language 
<A NAME="376"></A>was heard throughout the camp, and the tribunes and centurions, mixing 
<A NAME="377"></A>with the troops, suggested commendations of the prudence of their general 
<A NAME="378"></A>in selecting for the rallying point and basis of his operations a colony 
<A NAME="379"></A>rich in military strength and resources. Finally, Spurinna himself, not 
<A NAME="380"></A>so much reproaching them with their error as exposing it by his arguments, 
<A NAME="381"></A>conducted them all back to Placentia, except some scouts whom he left, 
<A NAME="382"></A>in a less turbulent temper and more amenable to command. The walls were 
<A NAME="383"></A>strengthened, battlements were added, and the towers were raised in height. 
<A NAME="384"></A>It was not only of the implements of war that provision and preparation 
<A NAME="385"></A>were made, but of the spirit of subordination and the love of obedience. 
<A NAME="386"></A>This was all that was wanting to the party, for they had no reason to be 
<A NAME="387"></A>dissatisfied with their courage.
<A NAME="388"></A><BR><BR>Caecina, who seemed to have left his cruelty and profligacy on 
<A NAME="389"></A>the other side of the Alps, advanced through Italy with his army under 
<A NAME="390"></A>excellent discipline. The towns and colonies, however, found indications 
<A NAME="391"></A>of a haughty spirit in the general's dress, when they saw the cloak of 
<A NAME="392"></A>various colours, and the trews, a garment of foreign fashion, clothed in 
<A NAME="393"></A>which he was wont to speak to their toga-clad citizens. And they resented, 
<A NAME="394"></A>as if with a sense of personal wrong, the conduct of his wife Salonina, 
<A NAME="395"></A>though it injured no one that she presented a conspicuous figure as she 
<A NAME="396"></A>rode through their towns on horseback in a purple habit. They were acting 
<A NAME="397"></A>on the instincts of human nature, which prompt men to scrutinize with keen 
<A NAME="398"></A>eyes the recent elevation of their fellows, and to demand a temperate use 
<A NAME="399"></A>of prosperity from none more rigorously than from those whom they have 
<A NAME="400"></A>seen on a level with themselves. Caecina, after crossing the Padus, sought 
<A NAME="401"></A>to tamper with the loyalty of the Othonianists at a conference in which 
<A NAME="402"></A>he held out hopes of reward, and he was himself assailed with the same 
<A NAME="403"></A>arts. After the specious but meaningless names of peace and concord had 
<A NAME="404"></A>been thus bandied to and fro, Caecina turned all his thoughts and plans 
<A NAME="405"></A>on the capture of Placentia, making a formidable show of preparation, as 
<A NAME="406"></A>he knew that according to the success of his opening operations would be 
<A NAME="407"></A>the subsequent prestige of his arms.
<A NAME="408"></A><BR><BR>The first day, however, was spent in a furious onset rather than 
<A NAME="409"></A>in the skilful approaches of a veteran army. Exposed and reckless, the 
<A NAME="410"></A>troops came close under the walls, stupefied by excess in food and wine. 
<A NAME="411"></A>In this struggle the amphitheatre, a most beautiful building, situated 
<A NAME="412"></A>outside the walls, was burnt to the ground, possibly set on fire by the 
<A NAME="413"></A>assailants, while they showered brands, fireballs, and ignited missiles, 
<A NAME="414"></A>on the besieged, possibly by the besieged themselves, while they discharged 
<A NAME="415"></A>incessant volleys in return. The populace of the town, always inclined 
<A NAME="416"></A>to be suspicious, believed that combustibles had been purposely introduced 
<A NAME="417"></A>into the building by certain persons from the neighbouring colonies, who 
<A NAME="418"></A>viewed it with envious and jealous eyes, because there was not in Italy 
<A NAME="419"></A>another building so capacious. Whatever the cause of the accident, it was 
<A NAME="420"></A>thought of but little moment as long as more terrible disasters were apprehended; 
<A NAME="421"></A>but as soon as they again felt secure, they lamented it as though they 
<A NAME="422"></A>could not have endured a heavier calamity. In the end Caecina was repulsed 
<A NAME="423"></A>with great slaughter among his troops, and the night was spent in the preparation 
<A NAME="424"></A>of siege-works. The Vitellianists constructed mantlets, hurdles, and sheds, 
<A NAME="425"></A>for undermining the walls and screening the assailants; the Othonianists 
<A NAME="426"></A>busied themselves in preparing stakes and huge masses of stone and of lead 
<A NAME="427"></A>and brass, with which to break and overwhelm the hostile ranks. The shame 
<A NAME="428"></A>of failure, the hope of renown, wrought on both armies; both were appealed 
<A NAME="429"></A>to by different arguments; on the one side they extolled the strength of 
<A NAME="430"></A>the legions and of the army of Germany; on the other, the distinctions 
<A NAME="431"></A>of the soldiery of the capital and the Praetorian cohorts; the one reviled 
<A NAME="432"></A>their foes as slothful and indolent soldiers, demoralized by the circus 
<A NAME="433"></A>and the theatres; the others retorted with the names of foreigner and barbarian. 
<A NAME="434"></A>At the same time they lauded or vituperated Otho and Vitellius, but found 
<A NAME="435"></A>indeed a more fruitful source of mutual provocation in invective than in 
<A NAME="436"></A>praise.
<A NAME="437"></A><BR><BR>Almost before dawn of day the walls were crowded with combatants, 
<A NAME="438"></A>and the plains glittered with masses of armed men. The close array of the 
<A NAME="439"></A>legions, and the skirmishing parties of auxiliaries assailed with showers 
<A NAME="440"></A>of arrows and stones the loftier parts of the walls, attacking them at 
<A NAME="441"></A>close quarters where they were undefended, or old and decayed. The Othonianists, 
<A NAME="442"></A>who could take a more deliberate and certain aim, poured down their javelins 
<A NAME="443"></A>on the German cohorts as they recklessly advanced to the attack with fierce 
<A NAME="444"></A>war-cries, brandishing their shields above their shoulders after the manner 
<A NAME="445"></A>of their country, and leaving their bodies unprotected. The soldiers of 
<A NAME="446"></A>the legions, working under cover of mantlets and hurdles, undermined the 
<A NAME="447"></A>walls, threw up earth-works, and endeavoured to burst open the gates. The 
<A NAME="448"></A>Praetorians opposed them by rolling down with a tremendous crash ponderous 
<A NAME="449"></A>masses of rock, placed for the purpose. Beneath these many of the assailants 
<A NAME="450"></A>were buried, and many, as the slaughter increased with the confusion, and 
<A NAME="451"></A>the attack from the walls became fiercer, retreated wounded, fainting, 
<A NAME="452"></A>and mangled, with serious damage to the prestige of the party. Caecina, 
<A NAME="453"></A>ashamed of the assault on which he had so rashly ventured, and unwilling, 
<A NAME="454"></A>ridiculed and baffled as he was, to remain in the same position, again 
<A NAME="455"></A>crossed the Padus, and resolved on marching to Cremona. As he was going, 
<A NAME="456"></A>Turullius Cerialis with a great number of the levies from the fleet, and 
<A NAME="457"></A>Julius Briganticus with a few troopers, gave themselves up to him. Julius 
<A NAME="458"></A>commanded a squadron of horse; he was a Batavian. Turullius was a centurion 
<A NAME="459"></A>of the first rank, not unfriendly to Caecina, as he had commanded a company 
<A NAME="460"></A>in Germany.
<A NAME="461"></A><BR><BR>Spurinna, on discovering the enemy's route, informed Annius Gallus 
<A NAME="462"></A>by letter of the successful defence of Placentia, of what had happened, 
<A NAME="463"></A>and of what Caecina intended to do. Gallus was then bringing up the first 
<A NAME="464"></A>legion to the relief of Placentia; he hardly dared trust so few cohorts, 
<A NAME="465"></A>fearing that they could not sustain a prolonged siege or the formidable 
<A NAME="466"></A>attack of the German army. On hearing that Caecina had been repulsed, and 
<A NAME="467"></A>was making his way to Cremona, though the legion could hardly be restrained, 
<A NAME="468"></A>and in its eagerness for action, even went to the length of open mutiny, 
<A NAME="469"></A>he halted at Bedriacum. This is a village situated between Verona and Cremona, 
<A NAME="470"></A>and has now acquired an ill-omened celebrity by two great days of disaster 
<A NAME="471"></A>to Rome. About the same time Martius Macer fought a successful battle not 
<A NAME="472"></A>far from Cremona. Martius, who was a man of energy, conveyed his gladiators 
<A NAME="473"></A>in boats across the Padus, and suddenly threw them upon the opposite bank. 
<A NAME="474"></A>The Vitellianist auxiliaries on the spot were routed; those who made a 
<A NAME="475"></A>stand were cut to pieces, the rest directing their flight to Cremona. But 
<A NAME="476"></A>the impetuosity of the victors was checked; for it was feared that the 
<A NAME="477"></A>enemy might be strengthened by reinforcements, and change the fortune of 
<A NAME="478"></A>the day. This policy excited the suspicions of the Othonianists, who put 
<A NAME="479"></A>a sinister construction on all the acts of their generals. Vying with each 
<A NAME="480"></A>other in an insolence of language proportioned to their cowardice of heart, 
<A NAME="481"></A>they assailed with various accusations Annius Gallus, Suetonius Paullinus, 
<A NAME="482"></A>and Marius Celsus. The murderers of Galba were the most ardent promoters 
<A NAME="483"></A>of mutiny and discord. Frenzied with fear and guilt, they sought to plunge 
<A NAME="484"></A>everything into confusion, resorting, now to openly seditious language, 
<A NAME="485"></A>now to secret letters to Otho; and he, ever ready to believe the meanest 
<A NAME="486"></A>of men and suspicious of the good, irresolute in prosperity, but rising 
<A NAME="487"></A>higher under reverses, was in perpetual alarm. The end of it was that he 
<A NAME="488"></A>sent for his brother Titianus, and intrusted him with the direction of 
<A NAME="489"></A>the campaign.
<A NAME="490"></A><BR><BR>Meanwhile, brilliant successes were gained under the command of 
<A NAME="491"></A>Celsus and Paullinus. Caecina was greatly annoyed by the fruitlessness 
<A NAME="492"></A>of all his undertakings, and by the waning reputation of his army. He had 
<A NAME="493"></A>been repulsed from Placentia; his auxiliaries had been recently cut up, 
<A NAME="494"></A>and even when the skirmishers had met in a series of actions, frequent 
<A NAME="495"></A>indeed, but not worth relating, he had been worsted; and now that Valens 
<A NAME="496"></A>was coming up, fearful that all the distinctions of the campaign would 
<A NAME="497"></A>centre in that general, he made a hasty attempt to retrieve his credit, 
<A NAME="498"></A>but with more impetuosity than prudence. Twelve miles from Cremona (at 
<A NAME="499"></A>a place called the Castors) he posted some of the bravest of his auxiliaries, 
<A NAME="500"></A>concealed in the woods that there overhang the road. The cavalry were ordered 
<A NAME="501"></A>to move forward, and, after provoking a battle, voluntarily to retreat, 
<A NAME="502"></A>and draw on the enemy in hasty pursuit, till the ambuscade could make a 
<A NAME="503"></A>simultaneous attack. The scheme was betrayed to the Othonianist generals, 
<A NAME="504"></A>and Paullinus assumed the command of the infantry, Celsus of the cavalry. 
<A NAME="505"></A>The veterans of the 13th legion, four cohorts of auxiliaries, and 500 cavalry, 
<A NAME="506"></A>were drawn up on the left side of the road; the raised causeway was occupied 
<A NAME="507"></A>by three Praetorian cohorts, ranged in deep columns; on the right front 
<A NAME="508"></A>stood the first legion with two cohorts of auxiliaries and 500 cavalry. 
<A NAME="509"></A>Besides these, a thousand cavalry, belonging to the Praetorian guard and 
<A NAME="510"></A>to the auxiliaries, were brought up to complete a victory or to retrieve 
<A NAME="511"></A>a repulse.
<A NAME="512"></A><BR><BR>Before the hostile lines engaged, the Vitellianists began to retreat, 
<A NAME="513"></A>but Celsus, aware of the stratagem, kept his men back. The Vitellianists 
<A NAME="514"></A>rashly left their position, and seeing Celsus gradually give way, followed 
<A NAME="515"></A>too far in pursuit, and themselves fell into an ambuscade. The auxiliaries 
<A NAME="516"></A>assailed them on either flank, the legions were opposed to them in front, 
<A NAME="517"></A>and the cavalry, by a sudden movement, had surrounded their rear. Suetonius 
<A NAME="518"></A>Paullinus did not at once give the infantry the signal to engage. He was 
<A NAME="519"></A>a man naturally tardy in action, and one who preferred a cautious and scientific 
<A NAME="520"></A>plan of operations to any success which was the result of accident. He 
<A NAME="521"></A>ordered the trenches to be filled up, the plain to be cleared, and the 
<A NAME="522"></A>line to be extended, holding that it would be time enough to begin his 
<A NAME="523"></A>victory when he had provided against being vanquished. This delay gave 
<A NAME="524"></A>the Vitellianists time to retreat into some vineyards, which were obstructed 
<A NAME="525"></A>by the interlacing layers of the vines, and close to which was a small 
<A NAME="526"></A>wood. From this place they again ventured to emerge, slaughtering the foremost 
<A NAME="527"></A>of the Praetorian cavalry. King Epiphanes was wounded, while he was zealously 
<A NAME="528"></A>cheering on the troops for Otho.
<A NAME="529"></A><BR><BR>Then the Othonianist infantry charged. The enemy's line was completely 
<A NAME="530"></A>crushed, and the reinforcements who were coming up to their aid were also 
<A NAME="531"></A>put to flight. Caecina indeed had not brought up his cohorts in a body, 
<A NAME="532"></A>but one by one; as this was done during the battle, it increased the general 
<A NAME="533"></A>confusion, because the troops who were thus divided, not being strong at 
<A NAME="534"></A>any one point, were borne away by the panic of the fugitives. Besides this, 
<A NAME="535"></A>a mutiny broke out in the camp because the whole army was not led into 
<A NAME="536"></A>action. Julius Gratus, prefect of the camp, was put in irons, on a suspicion 
<A NAME="537"></A>of a treacherous understanding with his brother who was serving with Otho's 
<A NAME="538"></A>army, at the very time that the Othonianists had done the same thing and 
<A NAME="539"></A>on the same grounds to that brother Julius Fronto, a tribune. In fact such 
<A NAME="540"></A>was the panic everywhere, among the fugitives and among the troops coming 
<A NAME="541"></A>up, in the lines and in front of the entrenchments, that it was very commonly 
<A NAME="542"></A>said on both sides, that Caecina and his whole army might have been destroyed, 
<A NAME="543"></A>had not Suetonius Paullinus given the signal of recall. Paullinus alleged 
<A NAME="544"></A>that he feared the effects of so much additional toil and so long a march, 
<A NAME="545"></A>apprehending that the Vitellianists might issue fresh from their camp, 
<A NAME="546"></A>and attack his wearied troops, who, once thrown into confusion, would have 
<A NAME="547"></A>no reserves to fall back upon. A few approved the general's policy, but 
<A NAME="548"></A>it was unfavourably canvassed by the army at large.
<A NAME="549"></A><BR><BR>The effect of this disaster on the Vitellianists was not so much 
<A NAME="550"></A>to drive them to fear as to draw them to obedience. Nor was this the case 
<A NAME="551"></A>only among the troops of Caecina, who indeed laid all the blame upon his 
<A NAME="552"></A>soldiers, more ready, as he said, for mutiny than for battle. The forces 
<A NAME="553"></A>also of Fabius Valens, who had now reached Ticinum, laid aside their contempt 
<A NAME="554"></A>for the enemy, and anxious to retrieve their credit began to yield a more 
<A NAME="555"></A>respectful and uniform obedience to their general. A serious mutiny, however, 
<A NAME="556"></A>had raged among them, of which, as it was not convenient to interrupt the 
<A NAME="557"></A>orderly narrative of Caecina's operations, I shall take up the history 
<A NAME="558"></A>at an earlier period. I have already described how the Batavian cohorts 
<A NAME="559"></A>who separated from the 14th legion during the Neronian war, hearing on 
<A NAME="560"></A>their way to Britain of the rising of Vitellius, joined Fabius Valens in 
<A NAME="561"></A>the country of the Lingones. They behaved themselves insolently, boasting, 
<A NAME="562"></A>as they visited the quarters of the several legions, that they had mastered 
<A NAME="563"></A>the men of the 14th, that they had taken Italy from Nero, that the whole 
<A NAME="564"></A>destiny of the war lay in their hands. Such language was insulting to the 
<A NAME="565"></A>soldiers, and offensive to the general. The discipline of the army was 
<A NAME="566"></A>relaxed by the brawls and quarrels which ensued. At last Valens began to 
<A NAME="567"></A>suspect that insolence would end in actual treachery.
<A NAME="568"></A><BR><BR>When, therefore, intelligence reached him that the cavalry of the 
<A NAME="569"></A>Treveri and the Tungrian infantry had been defeated by Otho's fleet, and 
<A NAME="570"></A>that Gallia Narbonensis was blockaded, anxious at once to protect a friendly 
<A NAME="571"></A>population, and, like a skilful soldier, to separate cohorts so turbulent 
<A NAME="572"></A>and, while they remained united, so inconveniently strong, he directed 
<A NAME="573"></A>a detachment of the Batavians to proceed to the relief of the province. 
<A NAME="574"></A>This having been heard and become generally known, the allies were discontented 
<A NAME="575"></A>and the legions murmured. "We are being deprived," they said, "of the help 
<A NAME="576"></A>of our bravest men. Those veteran troops victorious in so many campaigns, 
<A NAME="577"></A>now that the enemy is in sight, are withdrawn, so to speak, from the very 
<A NAME="578"></A>field of battle. If indeed a province be of more importance than the capital 
<A NAME="579"></A>and the safety of the Empire, let us all follow them thither, but if the 
<A NAME="580"></A>reality, the support, the mainstay of success, centre in Italy, you must 
<A NAME="581"></A>not tear, as it were, from a body its very strongest 
<A NAME="582"></A>limbs."
<A NAME="583"></A><BR><BR>In the midst of these fierce exclamations, Valens, sending his 
<A NAME="584"></A>lictors into the crowd, attempted to quell the mutiny. On this they attacked 
<A NAME="585"></A>the general himself, hurled stones at him, and, when he fled, pursued him. 
<A NAME="586"></A>Crying out that he was concealing the spoil of Gaul, the gold of the men 
<A NAME="587"></A>of Vienna, the hire of their own toils, they ransacked his baggage, and 
<A NAME="588"></A>probed with javelins and lances the walls of the general's tent and the 
<A NAME="589"></A>very ground beneath. Valens, disguised in the garb of a slave, found concealment 
<A NAME="590"></A>with a subaltern officer of cavalry. After this, Alfenius Varus, prefect 
<A NAME="591"></A>of the camp, seeing that the mutiny was gradually subsiding, promoted the 
<A NAME="592"></A>reaction by the following device. He forbade the centurions to visit the 
<A NAME="593"></A>sentinels, and discontinued the trumpet calls by which the troops are summoned 
<A NAME="594"></A>to their usual military duties. Thereupon all stood paralysed, and gazed 
<A NAME="595"></A>at each other in amazement, panic-stricken by the very fact that there 
<A NAME="596"></A>was no one to direct them. By their silence, by their submission, finally 
<A NAME="597"></A>by their tears and entreaties, they craved forgiveness. But when Valens, 
<A NAME="598"></A>thus unexpectedly preserved, came forward in sad plight, shedding tears, 
<A NAME="599"></A>they were moved to joy, to pity, even to affection. Their revulsion to 
<A NAME="600"></A>delight was just that of a mob, always extreme in either emotion. They 
<A NAME="601"></A>greeted him with praises and congratulations, and surrounding him with 
<A NAME="602"></A>the eagles and standards, carried him to the tribunal. With a politic prudence 
<A NAME="603"></A>he refrained from demanding capital punishment in any case; yet, fearing 
<A NAME="604"></A>that he might lay himself more open to suspicion by concealment of his 
<A NAME="605"></A>feelings, he censured a few persons, well aware that in civil wars the 
<A NAME="606"></A>soldiers have more license than the generals.
<A NAME="607"></A><BR><BR>While they were fortifying a camp at Ticinum, the news of Caecina's 
<A NAME="608"></A>defeat reached them, and the mutiny nearly broke out afresh from an impression 
<A NAME="609"></A>that underhand dealing and delay on the part of Valens had kept them away 
<A NAME="610"></A>from the battle. They refused all rest; they would not wait for their general; 
<A NAME="611"></A>they advanced in front of the standards, and hurried on the standard-bearers. 
<A NAME="612"></A>After a rapid march they joined Caecina. The character of Valens did not 
<A NAME="613"></A>stand well with Caecina's army. They complained that, though so much weaker 
<A NAME="614"></A>in numbers, they had been exposed to the whole force of the enemy, thus 
<A NAME="615"></A>at once excusing themselves, and extolling, in the implied flattery, the 
<A NAME="616"></A>strength of the new arrivals, who might, they feared, despise them as beaten 
<A NAME="617"></A>and spiritless soldiers. Though Valens had the stronger army, nearly double 
<A NAME="618"></A>the number of legions and auxiliaries, yet the partialities of the soldiers 
<A NAME="619"></A>inclined to Caecina, not only from the geniality of heart, which he was 
<A NAME="620"></A>thought more ready to display, but even from his vigorous age, his commanding 
<A NAME="621"></A>person, and a certain superficial attractiveness which he possessed. The 
<A NAME="622"></A>result was a jealousy between the two generals. Caecina ridiculed his colleague 
<A NAME="623"></A>as a man of foul and infamous character; Valens retorted with charges of 
<A NAME="624"></A>emptiness and vanity. But concealing their enmity, they devoted themselves 
<A NAME="625"></A>to their common interest, and in frequent letters, without any thought 
<A NAME="626"></A>of pardon, heaped all manner of charges upon Otho, while the Othonianist 
<A NAME="627"></A>generals, though they had the most abundant materials for invective against 
<A NAME="628"></A>Vitellius, refrained from employing them.
<A NAME="629"></A><BR><BR>In fact, before the death of these two men (and it was by his death 
<A NAME="630"></A>that Otho gained high renown, as Vitellius incurred by his the foulest 
<A NAME="631"></A>infamy), Vitellius with his indolent luxury was less dreaded than Otho 
<A NAME="632"></A>with his ardent passions. The murder of Galba had made the one terrible 
<A NAME="633"></A>and odious, while no one reckoned against the other the guilt of having 
<A NAME="634"></A>begun the war. Vitellius with his sensuality and gluttony was his own enemy; 
<A NAME="635"></A>Otho, with his profligacy, his cruelty, and his recklessness, was held 
<A NAME="636"></A>to be more dangerous to the Commonwealth. When Caecina and Valens had united 
<A NAME="637"></A>their forces, the Vitellianists had no longer any reason to delay giving 
<A NAME="638"></A>battle with their whole strength. Otho deliberated as to whether protracting 
<A NAME="639"></A>the war or risking an engagement were the better course. Then Suetonius 
<A NAME="640"></A>Paullinus, thinking that it befitted his reputation, which was such that 
<A NAME="641"></A>no one at that period was looked upon as a more skilful soldier, to give 
<A NAME="642"></A>an opinion on the whole conduct of the war, contended that impatience would 
<A NAME="643"></A>benefit the enemy, while delay would serve their own 
<A NAME="644"></A>cause.
<A NAME="645"></A><BR><BR>"The entire army of Vitellius," he said, "has already arrived. 
<A NAME="646"></A>Nor have they much strength in their rear, since Gaul is ready to rise, 
<A NAME="647"></A>and to abandon the banks of the Rhine, when such hostile tribes are ready 
<A NAME="648"></A>to burst in, would not answer his purpose. A hostile people and an intervening 
<A NAME="649"></A>sea keep from him the army of Britain; Spain is not over full of troops; 
<A NAME="650"></A>Gallia Narbonensis has been cowed by the attack of our ships and by a defeat; 
<A NAME="651"></A>Italy beyond the Padus is shut in by the Alps, cannot be relieved from 
<A NAME="652"></A>the sea, and has been exhausted by the passage of his army. For that army 
<A NAME="653"></A>there is no where any corn, and without supplies an army cannot be kept 
<A NAME="654"></A>together. Then the Germans, the most formidable part of the enemy's forces, 
<A NAME="655"></A>should the war be protracted into the summer, will sink with enfeebled 
<A NAME="656"></A>frames under the change of country and climate. Many a war, formidable 
<A NAME="657"></A>in its first impetuosity, has passed into nothing through the weariness 
<A NAME="658"></A>of delay. We, on the other hand, have on all sides abundant resources and 
<A NAME="659"></A>loyal adherents. We have Pannonia, Moesia, Dalmatia, the East with its 
<A NAME="660"></A>armies yet intact, we have Italy and Rome, the capital of the Empire, the 
<A NAME="661"></A>Senate, and the people, names that never lose their splendour, though they 
<A NAME="662"></A>may sometimes be eclipsed. We have the wealth of the State and of private 
<A NAME="663"></A>individuals. We have a vast supply of money, which in a civil war is a 
<A NAME="664"></A>mightier weapon than the sword. Our soldiers are inured to the climate 
<A NAME="665"></A>of Italy or to yet greater heat. We have the river Padus on our front, 
<A NAME="666"></A>and cities strongly garrisoned and fortified, none of which will surrender 
<A NAME="667"></A>to the enemy, as the defence of Placentia has proved. Let Otho therefore 
<A NAME="668"></A>protract the war. In a few days the 14th legion, itself highly renowned, 
<A NAME="669"></A>will arrive with the troops from Moesia. He may then again consider the 
<A NAME="670"></A>question, and should a battle be resolved on, we shall fight with increased 
<A NAME="671"></A>strength."
<A NAME="672"></A><BR><BR>Marius Celsus acquiesced in the opinion of Paullinus; and Annius 
<A NAME="673"></A>Gallus, who a few days before had been seriously injured by the fall of 
<A NAME="674"></A>his horse, was reported to agree by those who had been sent to ascertain 
<A NAME="675"></A>his opinion. Otho was inclined to risk a decisive battle. His brother Titianus, 
<A NAME="676"></A>and Proculus, the prefect of the Praetorian Guard, ignorant and therefore 
<A NAME="677"></A>impatient, declared that fortune, the Gods, and the genius of Otho, were 
<A NAME="678"></A>with their counsels, and would be with their enterprises. That no one might 
<A NAME="679"></A>dare to oppose their views, they had taken refuge in flattery. It having 
<A NAME="680"></A>been resolved to give battle, it became a question whether it would be 
<A NAME="681"></A>better for the Emperor to be present in person, or to withdraw. Paullinus 
<A NAME="682"></A>and Celsus no longer opposed, for they would not seem to put the Emperor 
<A NAME="683"></A>in the way of peril, and these same men who suggested the baser policy 
<A NAME="684"></A>prevailed on him to retire to Brixellum, and thus secure from the hazards 
<A NAME="685"></A>of the field, to reserve himself for the administration of empire. That 
<A NAME="686"></A>day first gave the death-blow to the party of Otho. Not only did a strong 
<A NAME="687"></A>detachment of the Praetorian cohorts, of the bodyguard, and of the cavalry, 
<A NAME="688"></A>depart with him, but the spirit of those who remained was broken, for the 
<A NAME="689"></A>men suspected their generals, and Otho, who alone had the confidence of 
<A NAME="690"></A>the soldiers, while he himself trusted in none but them, had left the generals' 
<A NAME="691"></A>authority on a doubtful footing.
<A NAME="692"></A><BR><BR>Nothing of this escaped the Vitellianists, for, as is usual in 
<A NAME="693"></A>civil wars, there were many deserters, and the spies, while busy in inquiring 
<A NAME="694"></A>into the plans of the enemy, failed to conceal their own. Meanwhile Caecina 
<A NAME="695"></A>and Valens remained quiet, and watched intently for the moment when the 
<A NAME="696"></A>enemy in his blindness should rush upon destruction, and found the usual 
<A NAME="697"></A>substitute for wisdom in waiting for the folly of others. They began to 
<A NAME="698"></A>form a bridge, making a feint of crossing the Padus, in the face of an 
<A NAME="699"></A>opposing force of gladiators; they wished also to keep their own soldiers 
<A NAME="700"></A>from passing their unoccupied time in idleness. Boats were ranged at equal 
<A NAME="701"></A>distances from each other, connected at both ends by strong beams, and 
<A NAME="702"></A>with their heads turned against the current, while anchors were thrown 
<A NAME="703"></A>out above to keep the bridge firm. The cables, however, instead of being 
<A NAME="704"></A>taut, hung loose in the water, in order that as the stream rose the vessels 
<A NAME="705"></A>might rise without their arrangement being disturbed. On the end of the 
<A NAME="706"></A>bridge was placed a turret; it was built out on the last boat, and from 
<A NAME="707"></A>it engines and machines might be worked to repel the enemy. The soldiers 
<A NAME="708"></A>of Otho also raised a turret on the opposite bank, and hurled from it stones 
<A NAME="709"></A>and flaming missiles.
<A NAME="710"></A><BR><BR>In the middle of the river was an island. While the gladiators 
<A NAME="711"></A>were making their way to it in boats, the Germans swam and outstripped 
<A NAME="712"></A>them. A considerable number, as it chanced, had effected the passage, when 
<A NAME="713"></A>Macer, having manned some light gallies, attacked them with the most active 
<A NAME="714"></A>of his gladiators. But the gladiator has not in battle the firmness of 
<A NAME="715"></A>the regular soldier, and now, as they stood on rocking vessels, they could 
<A NAME="716"></A>not direct their blows like men who had a sure footing on land. As the 
<A NAME="717"></A>men in their alarm made confused movements, rowers and combatants were 
<A NAME="718"></A>mingled together in disorder; upon this, the Germans themselves leapt into 
<A NAME="719"></A>the shallows, laid hold of the boats, climbed over the gunwales, or sank 
<A NAME="720"></A>them with their hands. All this passed in the sight of both armies, and 
<A NAME="721"></A>the more it delighted the Vitellianists, the more vehemently did the Othonianists 
<A NAME="722"></A>curse the cause and author of the disaster.
<A NAME="723"></A><BR><BR>The conflict was terminated by the flight of the vanquished, who 
<A NAME="724"></A>carried off what boats were left. Then they cried out for the execution 
<A NAME="725"></A>of Macer. He had been wounded by a javelin thrown from a distance, and 
<A NAME="726"></A>the soldiers had made a rush upon him with drawn swords, when he was saved 
<A NAME="727"></A>by the interference of the tribunes and centurions. Soon after Vestricius 
<A NAME="728"></A>Spurinna, having received orders to that effect from Otho, joined with 
<A NAME="729"></A>his cohorts, leaving but a moderate force in garrison at Placentia. After 
<A NAME="730"></A>this Otho sent Flavius Sabinus, consul elect, to take the command of the 
<A NAME="731"></A>troops which had been under Macer; the soldiers were delighted by this 
<A NAME="732"></A>change of generals, while the generals were led by these continual outbreaks 
<A NAME="733"></A>to regard with disgust so hateful a service.
<A NAME="734"></A><BR><BR>I find it stated by some authors that either the dread of or the 
<A NAME="735"></A>disgust felt for both Emperors, whose wickedness and infamy were coming 
<A NAME="736"></A>out every day into more open notoriety, made the two armies hesitate whether 
<A NAME="737"></A>they should not cease their strife, and either themselves consult together, 
<A NAME="738"></A>or allow the Senate to choose an Emperor; and that, for this reason, Otho's 
<A NAME="739"></A>generals recommended a certain measure of delay, Paullinus especially entertaining 
<A NAME="740"></A>hopes for himself, on the ground that he was the senior among the men of 
<A NAME="741"></A>consular rank, that he was well known as a soldier, and had attained great 
<A NAME="742"></A>distinction and fame by his campaigns in Britain. Though I would allow 
<A NAME="743"></A>that there were some few who in their secret wishes prayed for peace in 
<A NAME="744"></A>the stead of disorder, for a worthy and blameless Emperor in the room of 
<A NAME="745"></A>men utterly worthless and wicked, yet I cannot suppose that Paullinus, 
<A NAME="746"></A>wise as he was, could have hoped in an age thoroughly depraved to find 
<A NAME="747"></A>such moderation in the common herd, as that men, who in their passion for 
<A NAME="748"></A>war had trampled peace under foot, should now in their affection for peace 
<A NAME="749"></A>renounce the charms of war; nor can I think that armies differing in language 
<A NAME="750"></A>and in character, could have united in such an agreement; or that lieutenants 
<A NAME="751"></A>and generals, who were for the most part burdened by the consciousness 
<A NAME="752"></A>of profligacy, of poverty, and of crime, could have endured any Emperor 
<A NAME="753"></A>who was not himself stained by vice, as well as bound by obligation to 
<A NAME="754"></A>themselves.
<A NAME="755"></A><BR><BR>That old passion for power which has been ever innate in man increased 
<A NAME="756"></A>and broke out as the Empire grew in greatness. In a state of moderate dimensions 
<A NAME="757"></A>equality was easily preserved; but when the world had been subdued, when 
<A NAME="758"></A>all rival kings and cities had been destroyed, and men had leisure to covet 
<A NAME="759"></A>wealth which they might enjoy in security, the early conflicts between 
<A NAME="760"></A>the patricians and the people were kindled into flame. At one time the 
<A NAME="761"></A>tribunes were factious, at another the consuls had unconstitutional power; 
<A NAME="762"></A>it was in the capital and the forum that we first essayed civil wars. Then 
<A NAME="763"></A>rose C. Marius, sprung from the very dregs of the populace, and L. Sulla, 
<A NAME="764"></A>the most ruthless of the patricians, who perverted into absolute dominion 
<A NAME="765"></A>the liberty which had yielded to their arms. After them came Cn. Pompeius, 
<A NAME="766"></A>with a character more disguised but no way better. Henceforth men's sole 
<A NAME="767"></A>object was supreme power. Legions formed of Roman citizens did not lay 
<A NAME="768"></A>down their arms at Pharsalia and Philippi, much less were the armies of 
<A NAME="769"></A>Otho and Vitellius likely of their own accord to abandon their strife. 
<A NAME="770"></A>They were driven into civil war by the same wrath from heaven, the same 
<A NAME="771"></A>madness among men, the same incentives to crime. That these wars were terminated 
<A NAME="772"></A>by what we may call single blows, was owing to want of energy in the chiefs. 
<A NAME="773"></A>But these reflections on the character of ancient and modern times have 
<A NAME="774"></A>carried me too far from my subject. I now return to the course of 
<A NAME="775"></A>events.
<A NAME="776"></A><BR><BR>Otho having started for Brixellum, the honours of supreme command 
<A NAME="777"></A>devolved on his brother Titianus, while the real power and control were 
<A NAME="778"></A>in the hands of the prefect Proculus. Celsus and Paullinus, as no one made 
<A NAME="779"></A>any use of their skill, did but screen with their idle title of general 
<A NAME="780"></A>the blunders of others. The tribunes and centurions were perplexed to see 
<A NAME="781"></A>that better men were despised, and that the most worthless carried the 
<A NAME="782"></A>day. The common soldiers were full of eagerness, but liked to criticise 
<A NAME="783"></A>rather than to obey the orders of their officers. It was resolved to move 
<A NAME="784"></A>the camp forward to the fourth milestone from Bedriacum, but it was done 
<A NAME="785"></A>so unskilfully, that though it was spring, and there were so many rivers 
<A NAME="786"></A>in the neighbourhood, the troops were distressed for want of water. Then 
<A NAME="787"></A>the subject of giving battle was discussed, Otho in his despatches ever 
<A NAME="788"></A>urging them to make haste, and the soldiers demanding that the Emperor 
<A NAME="789"></A>should be present at the conflict; many begged that the troops quartered 
<A NAME="790"></A>beyond the Padus should be brought up. It is not so easy to determine what 
<A NAME="791"></A>was best to be done, as it is to be sure that what was done was the very 
<A NAME="792"></A>worst.
<A NAME="793"></A><BR><BR>They started for a campaign rather than for a battle, making for 
<A NAME="794"></A>the confluence of the Padus and Addua, a distance of sixteen miles from 
<A NAME="795"></A>their position. Celsus and Paullinus remonstrated against exposing troops 
<A NAME="796"></A>wearied with a march and encumbered with baggage to any enemy, who, being 
<A NAME="797"></A>himself ready for action and having marched barely four miles, would not 
<A NAME="798"></A>fail to attack them, either when they were in the confusion of an advance, 
<A NAME="799"></A>or when they were dispersed and busy with the work of entrenchment. Titianus 
<A NAME="800"></A>and Proculus, overcome in argument, fell back on the Imperial authority. 
<A NAME="801"></A>It was true that a Numidian had arrived at full gallop with an angry message 
<A NAME="802"></A>from Otho, in which the Emperor, sick of delay and impatient of suspense, 
<A NAME="803"></A>sharply rebuked the inactivity of the generals, and commanded that matters 
<A NAME="804"></A>should be brought to an issue.
<A NAME="805"></A><BR><BR>The same day, while Caecina was engaged on the construction of 
<A NAME="806"></A>a bridge, two tribunes of the Praetorian Guard came to him and begged an 
<A NAME="807"></A>interview. He was on the point of hearing their proposals and sending back 
<A NAME="808"></A>his own, when the scouts arrived at headlong speed with the news that the 
<A NAME="809"></A>enemy were close at hand. The address of the tribunes was thus abruptly 
<A NAME="810"></A>terminated. Thus it remained uncertain whether deception, or treason, or 
<A NAME="811"></A>some honourable arrangement, had been in their thoughts. Caecina dismissed 
<A NAME="812"></A>the tribunes and rode back to the camp. There he found that Fabius Valens 
<A NAME="813"></A>had given the signal for battle, and that the troops were under arms. While 
<A NAME="814"></A>the legions were casting lots for the order of march, the cavalry charged, 
<A NAME="815"></A>and, strange to say, were kept only by the courage of the Italian legion 
<A NAME="816"></A>from being driven back on the entrenchments by an inferior force of Othonianists. 
<A NAME="817"></A>These men, at the sword's point, compelled the beaten squadron to wheel 
<A NAME="818"></A>round and resume the conflict. The line of the Vitellianists was formed 
<A NAME="819"></A>without hurry, for, though the enemy was close at hand, the sight of their 
<A NAME="820"></A>arms was intercepted by the thick brushwood. In Otho's army the generals 
<A NAME="821"></A>were full of fear, and the soldiers hated their officers; the baggage-wagons 
<A NAME="822"></A>and the camp-followers were mingled with the troops; and as there were 
<A NAME="823"></A>steep ditches on both sides the road, it would have been found too narrow 
<A NAME="824"></A>even for an undisturbed advance. Some were gathering round their standards; 
<A NAME="825"></A>others were seeking them; everywhere was heard the confused shouting of 
<A NAME="826"></A>men who were joining the ranks, or calling to their comrades, and each, 
<A NAME="827"></A>as he was prompted by courage or by cowardice, rushed on to the front, 
<A NAME="828"></A>or slunk back to the rear.
<A NAME="829"></A><BR><BR>From the consternation of panic their feelings passed under the 
<A NAME="830"></A>influence of a groundless joy into languid indifference, some persons spreading 
<A NAME="831"></A>the lie that Vitellius' army had revolted. Whether this rumour was circulated 
<A NAME="832"></A>by the spies of Vitellius, or originated in treachery or in accident among 
<A NAME="833"></A>the partisans of Otho, has never been clearly ascertained. Forgetting their 
<A NAME="834"></A>warlike ardour, the Othonianists at once greeted the foe; as they were 
<A NAME="835"></A>answered by an angry murmur, they caused apprehensions of treachery in 
<A NAME="836"></A>many of their own side, who did not know what the greeting meant. Then 
<A NAME="837"></A>the enemy's line charged with its ranks unbroken, in strength and in numbers 
<A NAME="838"></A>superior; the Othonianists, scattered and weary as they were, met the attack 
<A NAME="839"></A>with spirit. The ground was so entangled with trees and vineyards that 
<A NAME="840"></A>the battle assumed many forms. They met in close and in distant conflict, 
<A NAME="841"></A>in line and in column. On the raised road they stood foot to foot, they 
<A NAME="842"></A>pushed with their bodies and their shields, and ceasing to throw their 
<A NAME="843"></A>javelins, they struck through helmets and breastplates with swords and 
<A NAME="844"></A>battle-axes. Recognising each other and distinctly seen by the rest of 
<A NAME="845"></A>the combatants, they were fighting to decide the whole issue of the 
<A NAME="846"></A>war.
<A NAME="847"></A><BR><BR>In an open plain between the Padus and the road, two legions happened 
<A NAME="848"></A>to meet. On the side of Vitellius was the 21st, called the Rapax, a corps 
<A NAME="849"></A>of old and distinguished renown. On that of Otho was the 1st, called Adjutrix, 
<A NAME="850"></A>which had never before been brought into the field, but was high-spirited, 
<A NAME="851"></A>and eager to gain its first triumph. The men of the 1st, overthrowing the 
<A NAME="852"></A>foremost ranks of the 21st, carried off the eagle. The 21st, infuriated 
<A NAME="853"></A>by this loss, not only repulsed the 1st, and slew the legate, Orfidius 
<A NAME="854"></A>Benignus, but captured many colours and standards from the enemy. In another 
<A NAME="855"></A>quarter the 13th legion was put to flight by a charge of the 5th. The 14th 
<A NAME="856"></A>was surrounded by a superior force. Otho's generals had long since fled 
<A NAME="857"></A>and Caecina and Valens strengthened their army with the reserves. New reinforcements 
<A NAME="858"></A>were supplied by Varus Alfenius with his Batavians. They had routed the 
<A NAME="859"></A>band of gladiators, which had been ferried across the river, and which 
<A NAME="860"></A>had been cut to pieces by the opposing cohorts while they were actually 
<A NAME="861"></A>in the water. Thus flushed with victory, they charged the flank of the 
<A NAME="862"></A>enemy.
<A NAME="863"></A><BR><BR>The centre of their line had been penetrated, and the Othonianists 
<A NAME="864"></A>fled on all sides in the direction of Bedriacum. The distance was very 
<A NAME="865"></A>great, and the roads were blocked up with heaps of corpses; thus the slaughter 
<A NAME="866"></A>was the greater, for captives taken in civil war can be turned to no profit. 
<A NAME="867"></A>Suetonius Paullinus and Licinius Proculus, taking different roads, avoided 
<A NAME="868"></A>the camp. Vedius Aquila, legate of the 13th legion, in the blindness of 
<A NAME="869"></A>fear, fell in the way of the furious soldiery. Late in the day he entered 
<A NAME="870"></A>the entrenchments, and found himself the centre of a mob of clamorous and 
<A NAME="871"></A>mutinous fugitives. They did not refrain from abuse or actual violence; 
<A NAME="872"></A>they reviled him as a deserter and traitor, not having any specific charge 
<A NAME="873"></A>against him, but all, after the fashion of the mob, imputing to him their 
<A NAME="874"></A>own crimes. Titianus and Celsus were favoured by the darkness. By that 
<A NAME="875"></A>time the sentries had been posted, and the soldiers reduced to order. Annius 
<A NAME="876"></A>Gallus had prevailed upon them by his prayers, his advice, and his personal 
<A NAME="877"></A>influence, not to aggravate the disaster of their defeat by mutual slaughter. 
<A NAME="878"></A>Whether the war was at an end, or whether they might choose to resume the 
<A NAME="879"></A>conflict, the vanquished would find in union the sole mitigation of their 
<A NAME="880"></A>lot. The spirit of the rest of the army was broken, but the Praetorians 
<A NAME="881"></A>angrily complained that they had been vanquished, not by valour, but by 
<A NAME="882"></A>treachery. "The Vitellianists indeed," they said, "gained no bloodless 
<A NAME="883"></A>victory; their cavalry was defeated, a legion lost its eagle. We have still 
<A NAME="884"></A>the troops beyond the Padus, and Otho himself. The legions of Moesia are 
<A NAME="885"></A>coming; a great part of the army remained at Bedriacum; these certainly 
<A NAME="886"></A>were never vanquished; and if it must be so, it is on the battlefield that 
<A NAME="887"></A>we shall fall with most honour." Amid all the exasperation or terror of 
<A NAME="888"></A>these thoughts, the extremity of despair yet roused them to fury rather 
<A NAME="889"></A>than to fear.
<A NAME="890"></A><BR><BR>The army of Vitellius bivouacked at the fifth milestone from Bedriacum. 
<A NAME="891"></A>The generals did not venture an assault on the enemy's camp that same day; 
<A NAME="892"></A>besides, a capitulation was expected. Though they were without baggage, 
<A NAME="893"></A>and had marched out only to fight, it was sufficient protection to them 
<A NAME="894"></A>that they had arms, and were victorious. On the following day, as the feeling 
<A NAME="895"></A>of Otho's army was evident, and those who had been most furious were inclined 
<A NAME="896"></A>to repent, envoys were sent, nor did the generals of Vitellius hesitate 
<A NAME="897"></A>to grant conditions of peace. The envoys indeed were detained for some 
<A NAME="898"></A>little time, and this circumstance caused some doubt, as it was not known 
<A NAME="899"></A>whether they had obtained their object; before long, however, they returned, 
<A NAME="900"></A>and the camp was thrown open. Both victors and vanquished melted into tears, 
<A NAME="901"></A>and cursed the fatality of civil strife with a melancholy joy. There in 
<A NAME="902"></A>the same tents did they dress the wounds of brothers or of kinsmen. Their 
<A NAME="903"></A>hopes, their rewards, were all uncertain; death and sorrow were sure. And 
<A NAME="904"></A>no one had so escaped misfortune as to have no bereavement to lament. Search 
<A NAME="905"></A>was made for the body of the legate Orfidius, and it was burnt with the 
<A NAME="906"></A>customary honours. A few were buried by their friends; the multitude that 
<A NAME="907"></A>remained were left above ground.
<A NAME="908"></A><BR><BR>Otho was awaiting news of the battle free from alarm and resolved 
<A NAME="909"></A>in purpose. First came gloomy tidings, and then fugitives from the field, 
<A NAME="910"></A>making known that all was lost. The zeal of the soldiers did not wait for 
<A NAME="911"></A>the Emperor to speak. They bade him be of good cheer, telling him that 
<A NAME="912"></A>he had still fresh forces, and that they would themselves endure and dare 
<A NAME="913"></A>to the last. This was no flattery; they were fired by a furious impulse 
<A NAME="914"></A>to seek the battle-field, and raise again the fallen fortunes of their 
<A NAME="915"></A>party. Those who stood at a distance stretched out their arms, those who 
<A NAME="916"></A>were near clasped the Emperor's knees, and Plotius Firmus was the most 
<A NAME="917"></A>zealous of them all. This man, who was prefect of the Praetorian Guard, 
<A NAME="918"></A>repeatedly besought Otho not to desert an army so loyal and soldiers so 
<A NAME="919"></A>deserving; "there was more courage in bearing trouble," he said, "than 
<A NAME="920"></A>in escaping from it; the brave and the energetic cling to hope, even in 
<A NAME="921"></A>spite of fortune; the cowardly and the indolent are hurried into despair 
<A NAME="922"></A>by their fears." While he was thus speaking, as Otho assumed a relenting 
<A NAME="923"></A>or a stern expression, the soldiers cheered or groaned. Nor was it only 
<A NAME="924"></A>the Praetorians, who were peculiarly Otho's troops, that thus acted; those 
<A NAME="925"></A>who had been sent on from Moesia declared that the approaching army was 
<A NAME="926"></A>as firmly resolved, and that the legions had entered Aquileia. No one therefore 
<A NAME="927"></A>can doubt that the war might have been renewed with its terrible disasters, 
<A NAME="928"></A>and its uncertainties both for victors and vanquished.
<A NAME="929"></A><BR><BR>Otho himself was opposed to all thoughts of war. He said, "I hold 
<A NAME="930"></A>that to expose such a spirit, such a courage as yours, to any further risk 
<A NAME="931"></A>is to put too high a value on my life. The more hope you hold out to me, 
<A NAME="932"></A>should I choose to live, the more glorious will be my death. Fortune and 
<A NAME="933"></A>I now know each other; you need not reckon for how long, for it is peculiarly 
<A NAME="934"></A>difficult to be moderate with that prosperity which you think you will 
<A NAME="935"></A>not long enjoy. The civil war began with Vitellius; he was the first cause 
<A NAME="936"></A>of our contending in arms for the throne; the example of not contending 
<A NAME="937"></A>more than once shall belong to me. By this let posterity judge of Otho. 
<A NAME="938"></A>Vitellius is welcome to his brother, his wife, his children. I need neither 
<A NAME="939"></A>revenge nor consolation. Others may have held the throne for a longer time, 
<A NAME="940"></A>but no one can have left it with such fortitude. Shall I suffer so large 
<A NAME="941"></A>a portion of the youth of Rome and so many noble armies to be again laid 
<A NAME="942"></A>low and to be lost to the State? Let this thought go with me, that you 
<A NAME="943"></A>were willing to die for me. But live, and let us no longer delay, lest 
<A NAME="944"></A>I interfere with your safety, you with my firmness. To say too much about 
<A NAME="945"></A>one's end is a mark of cowardice. Take as the strongest proof of my determination 
<A NAME="946"></A>the fact that I complain of no one. To accuse either gods or men is only 
<A NAME="947"></A>for him who wishes to live."
<A NAME="948"></A><BR><BR>After having thus spoken, he courteously entreated all in terms 
<A NAME="949"></A>befitting their age and rank to go at once, and not exasperate the anger 
<A NAME="950"></A>of the conqueror by staying. With the young he used his authority, with 
<A NAME="951"></A>the old his prayers, and still his look was calm, his speech collected, 
<A NAME="952"></A>as he checked the unseasonable tears of his friends. He gave orders that 
<A NAME="953"></A>those who were departing should be furnished with boats and carriages; 
<A NAME="954"></A>he destroyed all memorials and letters remarkable for their expressions 
<A NAME="955"></A>of zeal for himself or their abuse of Vitellius. He distributed some gratuities, 
<A NAME="956"></A>but sparingly, and not like a man who was soon to die. Then he even administered 
<A NAME="957"></A>consolation to Salvius Cocceianus, his brother's son, a very young man, 
<A NAME="958"></A>who was anxious and sorrowful, praising his affection while he rebuked 
<A NAME="959"></A>his fear. "Do you think," he said, "that Vitellius will shew so ruthless 
<A NAME="960"></A>a temper that he will not make even this return for the preservation of 
<A NAME="961"></A>his whole family? By hastening my end I earn the clemency of the conqueror. 
<A NAME="962"></A>It is not in the extremity of despair, but while my army yet cries for 
<A NAME="963"></A>battle, that I have sacrificed to the State my last chance. I have obtained 
<A NAME="964"></A>enough reputation for myself, enough nobility for my family. Successor 
<A NAME="965"></A>to the Julii, the Claudii, the Servii, have been the first to bring the 
<A NAME="966"></A>Imperial dignity into a new family. Enter then on life with a brave heart, 
<A NAME="967"></A>and never entirely forget, or remember too vividly, that Otho was your 
<A NAME="968"></A>uncle."
<A NAME="969"></A><BR><BR>After this he dismissed every one, and took some repose. He was 
<A NAME="970"></A>now pondering in his heart the last cares of life, when his attention was 
<A NAME="971"></A>distracted by a sudden tumult and he was told of the confusion and outrageous 
<A NAME="972"></A>conduct of the soldiers. They were threatening with death all who attempted 
<A NAME="973"></A>to depart, and were extreme in their violence against Verginius, whose 
<A NAME="974"></A>house they had blockaded and were besieging. After rebuking the ringleaders 
<A NAME="975"></A>of the tumult, he returned and employed himself in granting interviews 
<A NAME="976"></A>to those who were departing, till all had left in safety. Towards evening 
<A NAME="977"></A>he quenched his thirst with a draught of cold water. Two daggers were brought 
<A NAME="978"></A>to him; he tried the edge of each, and then put one under his head. After 
<A NAME="979"></A>satisfying himself that his friends had set out, he passed a tranquil night, 
<A NAME="980"></A>and it is even said that he slept. At dawn he fell with his breast upon 
<A NAME="981"></A>the steel. Hearing a groan from the dying man, his freedmen and slaves, 
<A NAME="982"></A>and Plotius Firmus, prefect of the Praetorian Guard, came in. They found 
<A NAME="983"></A>but one wound. His funeral was hastily performed. He had made this the 
<A NAME="984"></A>subject of earnest entreaties, anxious that his head might not be cut off 
<A NAME="985"></A>and subjected to indignities. The Praetorian cohorts carried his body with 
<A NAME="986"></A>praises and tears, covering his wound and his hands with kisses. Some of 
<A NAME="987"></A>the soldiers killed themselves near the funeral pile, not moved by remorse 
<A NAME="988"></A>or by fear, but by the desire to emulate his glory, and by love of their 
<A NAME="989"></A>Prince. Afterwards this kind of death became a common practice among all 
<A NAME="990"></A>ranks at Bedriacum, at Placentia, and in the other camps. Over Otho was 
<A NAME="991"></A>built a tomb unpretending and therefore likely to stand.
<A NAME="992"></A><BR><BR>Thus Otho ended his life in the 37th year of his age. He came from 
<A NAME="993"></A>the municipal town of Ferentinum. His father was of consular, his grandfather 
<A NAME="994"></A>of praetorian rank. His family on the mother's side was of less distinction, 
<A NAME="995"></A>but yet respectable. What his boyhood and his youth had been, we have already 
<A NAME="996"></A>shewn. By two daring acts, one most atrocious, the other singularly noble, 
<A NAME="997"></A>he earned in the eyes of posterity about an equal share of infamy and of 
<A NAME="998"></A>glory. I should think it unbecoming the dignity of the task which I have 
<A NAME="999"></A>undertaken, to collect fabulous marvels, and to amuse with fiction the 
<A NAME="1000"></A>tastes of my readers; at the same time I would not venture to impugn the 
<A NAME="1001"></A>credit of common report and tradition. The natives of these parts relate 
<A NAME="1002"></A>that on the day when the battle was being fought at Bedriacum, a bird of 
<A NAME="1003"></A>unfamiliar appearance settled in a much frequented grove near Regium Lepidum, 
<A NAME="1004"></A>and was not frightened or driven away by the concourse of people, or by 
<A NAME="1005"></A>the multitude of birds that flocked round it, until Otho killed himself; 
<A NAME="1006"></A>then it vanished. When they came to compute the time, it was found that 
<A NAME="1007"></A>the commencement and the end of this strange occurrence tallied with the 
<A NAME="1008"></A>last scenes of Otho's life.
<A NAME="1009"></A><BR><BR>At the funeral the mutinous spirit of the soldiers was kindled 
<A NAME="1010"></A>afresh by their sorrow and regret, and there was no one to check them. 
<A NAME="1011"></A>They turned to Verginius, and in threatening language, at one time besought 
<A NAME="1012"></A>him to accept the Imperial dignity, at another, to act as envoy to Caecina 
<A NAME="1013"></A>and Valens. Verginius secretly departed by a back way from his house, and 
<A NAME="1014"></A>thus managed to elude them when they burst in. Rubrius Gallus was charged 
<A NAME="1015"></A>with the petition of the cohorts which had been quartered at Brixellum. 
<A NAME="1016"></A>An amnesty was immediately granted to them, while at the same time the 
<A NAME="1017"></A>forces which had been commanded by Flavius Sabinus signified through him 
<A NAME="1018"></A>their submission to the conqueror.
<A NAME="1019"></A><BR><BR>Hostilities had ceased everywhere, but a considerable number of 
<A NAME="1020"></A>the Senate, who had accompanied Otho from Rome, and had been afterwards 
<A NAME="1021"></A>left at Mutina, encountered the utmost peril. News of the defeat was brought 
<A NAME="1022"></A>to this place. The soldiers, however, rejected it as a false report; and 
<A NAME="1023"></A>judging the Senate to be hostile to Otho, watched their language, and put 
<A NAME="1024"></A>an unfavourable construction on their looks and manner. Proceeding at last 
<A NAME="1025"></A>to abuse and insults, they sought a pretext for beginning a massacre, while 
<A NAME="1026"></A>a different anxiety also weighed upon the Senators, who, knowing that the 
<A NAME="1027"></A>party of Vitellius was in the ascendant, feared that they might seem to 
<A NAME="1028"></A>have been tardy in welcoming the conqueror. Thus they met in great alarm 
<A NAME="1029"></A>and distracted by a twofold apprehension; no one was ready with any advice 
<A NAME="1030"></A>of his own, but looked for safety in sharing any mistake with many others. 
<A NAME="1031"></A>The anxieties of the terrified assembly were aggravated when the Senate 
<A NAME="1032"></A>of Mutina made them an offer of arms and money, and, with an ill-timed 
<A NAME="1033"></A>compliment, styled them "Conscript Fathers."
<A NAME="1034"></A><BR><BR>There then ensued a notable quarrel, Licinius Caecina inveighing 
<A NAME="1035"></A>against Marcellus Eprius, for using ambiguous language. The rest indeed 
<A NAME="1036"></A>did not express their opinions, but the name of Marcellus, exposed as it 
<A NAME="1037"></A>was to odium from the hateful recollection of his career as an informer, 
<A NAME="1038"></A>had roused in Caecina, who was an unknown man, and had lately been made 
<A NAME="1039"></A>a Senator, the hope of distinguishing himself by making great enemies. 
<A NAME="1040"></A>The moderation of wiser men put an end to the dispute. They all returned 
<A NAME="1041"></A>to Bononia, intending there to deliberate again, and also expecting further 
<A NAME="1042"></A>news in the meantime. At Bononia they posted men on the different roads 
<A NAME="1043"></A>to make enquiries of every newcomer; one of Otho's freedmen, on being questioned 
<A NAME="1044"></A>as to the cause of his departure, replied that he was entrusted with his 
<A NAME="1045"></A>master's last commands; Otho was still alive, he said, when he left him, 
<A NAME="1046"></A>but his only thoughts were for posterity, and he had torn himself from 
<A NAME="1047"></A>all the fascinations of life. They were struck with admiration, and were 
<A NAME="1048"></A>ashamed to put any more questions, and then the hearts of all turned to 
<A NAME="1049"></A>Vitellius.
<A NAME="1050"></A><BR><BR>Lucius Vitellius, the brother of the Emperor, was present at their 
<A NAME="1051"></A>deliberations, and was preparing to receive their flatteries, when of a 
<A NAME="1052"></A>sudden Coenus, a freedman of Nero, threw them all into consternation by 
<A NAME="1053"></A>an outrageous falsehood. He asserted that, by the arrival of the 14th legion, 
<A NAME="1054"></A>joined to the forces from Brixellum, the victorious army had been routed 
<A NAME="1055"></A>and the fortunes of the party changed. The object of this fabrication was 
<A NAME="1056"></A>that the passports of Otho, which were beginning to be disregarded, might 
<A NAME="1057"></A>through more favourable news recover their validity. Coenus was conveyed 
<A NAME="1058"></A>with rapidity to the capital, but a few days after suffered the penalty 
<A NAME="1059"></A>of his crime by the order of Vitellius. The peril of the Senators was increased 
<A NAME="1060"></A>by the soldiers of Otho's army believing that the intelligence thus brought 
<A NAME="1061"></A>was authentic. Their alarm was heightened by the fact that their departure 
<A NAME="1062"></A>from Mutina and their desertion of the party had the appearance of a public 
<A NAME="1063"></A>resolution. They did not meet again for general deliberation, but every 
<A NAME="1064"></A>man consulted his own safety, till letters arrived from Fabius Valens which 
<A NAME="1065"></A>removed their fear. Besides, the very glory of Otho's death made the news 
<A NAME="1066"></A>travel more quickly.
<A NAME="1067"></A><BR><BR>At Rome, however, there was no alarm; the games of Ceres were attended 
<A NAME="1068"></A>as usual. When trustworthy messengers brought into the theatre the news 
<A NAME="1069"></A>that Otho was dead, and that all the troops in the capital had taken the 
<A NAME="1070"></A>oath to Vitellius under the direction of Flavius Sabinus, prefect of the 
<A NAME="1071"></A>city, the spectators greeted the name of Vitellius with applause. The people 
<A NAME="1072"></A>carried round the temples images of Galba, ornamented with laurel leaves 
<A NAME="1073"></A>and flowers, and piled chaplets in the form of a sepulchral mound near 
<A NAME="1074"></A>the lake of Curtius, on the
