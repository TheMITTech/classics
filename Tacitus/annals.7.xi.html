<A NAME="start"></A>
<A NAME="10"></A>A.D. 47, 48
<A NAME="11"></A><BR><BR>Messalina believed that Valerius Asiaticus, who had been twice 
<A NAME="12"></A>consul, was one of Poppaea's old lovers. At the same time she was looking 
<A NAME="13"></A>greedily at the gardens which Lucullus had begun and which Asiaticus was 
<A NAME="14"></A>now adorning with singular magnificence, and so she suborned Suilius to 
<A NAME="15"></A>accuse both him and Poppaea. With Suilius was associated Sosibius, tutor 
<A NAME="16"></A>to Britannicus, who was to give Claudius an apparently friendly warning 
<A NAME="17"></A>to beware of a power and wealth which threatened the throne. Asiaticus, 
<A NAME="18"></A>he said, had been the ringleader in the murder of a Caesar, and then had 
<A NAME="19"></A>not feared to face an assembly of the Roman people, to own the deed, and 
<A NAME="20"></A>challenge its glory for his own. Thus grown famous in the capital, and 
<A NAME="21"></A>with a renown widely spread through the provinces, he was planning a journey 
<A NAME="22"></A>to the armies of Germany. Born at Vienna, and supported by numerous and 
<A NAME="23"></A>powerful connections, he would find it easy to rouse nations allied to 
<A NAME="24"></A>his house. Claudius made no further inquiry, but sent Crispinus, commander 
<A NAME="25"></A>of the Praetorians, with troops in hot haste, as though to put down a revolt. 
<A NAME="26"></A>Crispinus found him at Baiae, loaded him with chains, and hurried him to 
<A NAME="27"></A>Rome.
<A NAME="28"></A><BR><BR>No hearing before the Senate was granted him. It was in the emperor's 
<A NAME="29"></A>chamber, in the presence of Messalina, that he was heard. There Suilius 
<A NAME="30"></A>accused him of corrupting the troops, of binding them by bribes and indulgences 
<A NAME="31"></A>to share in every crime, of adultery with Poppaea, and finally of unmanly 
<A NAME="32"></A>vice. It was at this last that the accused broke silence, and burst out 
<A NAME="33"></A>with the words, "Question thy own sons, Suilius;they will own my manhood." 
<A NAME="34"></A>Then he entered on his defence. Claudius he moved profoundly, and he even 
<A NAME="35"></A>drew tears from Messalina. But as she left the chamber to wipe them away, 
<A NAME="36"></A>she warned Vitellius not to let the man escape. She hastened herself to 
<A NAME="37"></A>effect Poppaea's destruction, and hired agents to drive her to suicide 
<A NAME="38"></A>by the terrors of a prison. Caesar meanwhile was so unconscious that a 
<A NAME="39"></A>few days afterwards he asked her husband Scipio, who was dining with him, 
<A NAME="40"></A>why he sat down to table without his wife, and was told in reply that she 
<A NAME="41"></A>had paid the debt of nature.
<A NAME="42"></A><BR><BR>When Claudius began to deliberate about the acquittal of Asiaticus, 
<A NAME="43"></A>Vitellius, with tears in his eyes, spoke of his old friendship with the 
<A NAME="44"></A>accused, and of their joint homage to the emperor's mother, Antonia. He 
<A NAME="45"></A>then briefly reviewed the services of Asiaticus to the State, his recent 
<A NAME="46"></A>campaign in the invasion of Britain, and everything else which seemed likely 
<A NAME="47"></A>to win compassion, and suggested that he should be free to choose his death. 
<A NAME="48"></A>Claudius's reply was in the same tone of mercy. Some friends urged on Asiaticus 
<A NAME="49"></A>the quiet death of self-starvation, but he declined it with thanks. He 
<A NAME="50"></A>took his usual exercise, then bathed and dined cheerfully, and saying that 
<A NAME="51"></A>he had better have fallen by the craft of Tiberius or the fury of Caius 
<A NAME="52"></A>Caesar than by the treachery of a woman and the shameless mouth of Vitellius, 
<A NAME="53"></A>he opened his veins, but not till he had inspected his funeral pyre, and 
<A NAME="54"></A>directed its removal to another spot, lest the smoke should hurt the thick 
<A NAME="55"></A>foliage of the trees. So complete was his calmness even to the 
<A NAME="56"></A>last.
<A NAME="57"></A><BR><BR>The senators were then convoked, and Suilius proceeded to find 
<A NAME="58"></A>new victims in two knights of the first rank who bore the surname of Petra. 
<A NAME="59"></A>The real cause of their destruction was that they had lent their house 
<A NAME="60"></A>for the meetings of Mnester and Poppaea. But it was a vision of the night 
<A NAME="61"></A>that was the actual charge against one of them. He had, it was alleged, 
<A NAME="62"></A>beheld Claudius crowned with a garland of wheat, the ears of which were 
<A NAME="63"></A>turned downwards, and, from this appearance, he foretold scanty harvests. 
<A NAME="64"></A>Some have said that it was a vine-wreath, of which the leaves were white, 
<A NAME="65"></A>which he saw, and that he interpreted it to signify the death of the emperor 
<A NAME="66"></A>after the turn of autumn. It is, however, beyond dispute that in consequence 
<A NAME="67"></A>of some dream, whatever it was, both the man and his brother 
<A NAME="68"></A>perished.
<A NAME="69"></A><BR><BR>Fifteen hundred thousand sesterces and the decorations of the praetorship 
<A NAME="70"></A>were voted to Crispinus. Vitellius bestowed a million on Sosibius, for 
<A NAME="71"></A>giving Britannicus the benefit of his teaching and Claudius that of his 
<A NAME="72"></A>counsels. I may add that when Scipio was called on for his opinion, he 
<A NAME="73"></A>replied, "As I think what all men think about the deeds of Poppaea, suppose 
<A NAME="74"></A>me to say what all men say." A graceful compromise this between the affection 
<A NAME="75"></A>of the husband and the necessities of the senator.
<A NAME="76"></A><BR><BR>Suilius after this plied his accusations without cessation or pity, 
<A NAME="77"></A>and his audacity had many rivals. By assuming to himself all the functions 
<A NAME="78"></A>of laws and magistrates, the emperor had left exposed everything which 
<A NAME="79"></A>invited plunder, and of all articles of public merchandise nothing was 
<A NAME="80"></A>more venal than the treachery of advocates. Thus it happened that one Samius, 
<A NAME="81"></A>a Roman knight of the first rank, who had paid four hundred thousand sesterces 
<A NAME="82"></A>to Suilius, stabbed himself in the advocate's house, on ascertaining his 
<A NAME="83"></A>collusion with the adversary. Upon this, following the lead of Silius, 
<A NAME="84"></A>consul-elect, whose elevation and fall I shall in due course relate, the 
<A NAME="85"></A>senators rose in a body, and demanded the enforcement of the Cincian law, 
<A NAME="86"></A>an old enactment, which forbade any one to receive a fee or a gift for 
<A NAME="87"></A>pleading a cause.
<A NAME="88"></A><BR><BR>When the men, at whom this strong censure was levelled, loudly 
<A NAME="89"></A>protested, Silius, who had a quarrel with Suilius, attacked them with savage 
<A NAME="90"></A>energy. He cited as examples the orators of old who had thought fame with 
<A NAME="91"></A>posterity the fairest recompense of eloquence. And, "apart from this," 
<A NAME="92"></A>he said, "the first of noble accomplishments was debased by sordid services, 
<A NAME="93"></A>and even good faith could not be upheld in its integrity, when men looked 
<A NAME="94"></A>at the greatness of their gains. If law suits turned to no one's profit, 
<A NAME="95"></A>there would be fewer of them. As it was, quarrels, accusations, hatreds 
<A NAME="96"></A>and wrongs were encouraged, in order that, as the violence of disease brings 
<A NAME="97"></A>fees to the physician, so the corruption of the forum might enrich the 
<A NAME="98"></A>advocate. They should remember Caius Asinius and Messala, and, in later 
<A NAME="99"></A>days, Arruntius and Aeserninus, men raised by a blameless life and by eloquence 
<A NAME="100"></A>to the highest honours."
<A NAME="101"></A><BR><BR>So spoke the consul-elect, and others agreed with him. A resolution 
<A NAME="102"></A>was being framed to bring the guilty under the law of extortion, when Suilius 
<A NAME="103"></A>and Cossutianus and the rest, who saw themselves threatened with punishment 
<A NAME="104"></A>rather than trial, for their guilt was manifest, gathered round the emperor, 
<A NAME="105"></A>and prayed forgiveness for the past.
<A NAME="106"></A><BR><BR>When he had nodded assent, they began to plead their cause. "Who," 
<A NAME="107"></A>they asked, "can be so arrogant as to anticipate in hope an eternity of 
<A NAME="108"></A>renown? It is for the needs and the business of life that the resource 
<A NAME="109"></A>of eloquence is acquired, thanks to which no one for want of an advocate 
<A NAME="110"></A>is at the mercy of the powerful. But eloquence cannot be obtained for nothing; 
<A NAME="111"></A>private affairs are neglected, in order that a man may devote himself to 
<A NAME="112"></A>the business of others. Some support life by the profession of arms, some 
<A NAME="113"></A>by cultivating land. No work is expected from any one of which he has not 
<A NAME="114"></A>before calculated the profits. It was easy for Asinius and Messala, enriched 
<A NAME="115"></A>with the prizes of the conflict between Antony and Augustus, it was easy 
<A NAME="116"></A>for Arruntius and Aeserninus, the heirs of wealthy families, to assume 
<A NAME="117"></A>grand airs. We have examples at hand. How great were the fees for which 
<A NAME="118"></A>Publius Clodius and Caius Curio were wont to speak! We are ordinary senators, 
<A NAME="119"></A>seeking in the tranquillity of the State for none but peaceful gains. You 
<A NAME="120"></A>must consider the plebeian, how he gains distinction from the gown. Take 
<A NAME="121"></A>away the rewards of a profession, and the profession must perish." The 
<A NAME="122"></A>emperor thought that these arguments, though less noble, were not without 
<A NAME="123"></A>force. He limited the fee which might be taken to ten thousand sesterces, 
<A NAME="124"></A>and those who exceeded this limit were to be liable to the penalties of 
<A NAME="125"></A>extortion.
<A NAME="126"></A><BR><BR>About this same time Mithridates, of whom I have before spoken 
<A NAME="127"></A>as having ruled Armenia, and having been imprisoned by order of Caius Caesar, 
<A NAME="128"></A>made his way back to his kingdom at the suggestion of Claudius and in reliance 
<A NAME="129"></A>on the help of Pharasmanes. This Pharasmanes, who was king of the Iberians 
<A NAME="130"></A>and Mithridates' brother, now told him that the Parthians were divided, 
<A NAME="131"></A>and that the highest questions of empire being uncertain, lesser matters 
<A NAME="132"></A>were neglected. Gotarzes, among his many cruelties, had caused the death 
<A NAME="133"></A>of his brother Artabanus, with his wife and son. Hence his people feared 
<A NAME="134"></A>for themselves and sent for Vardanes. Ever ready for daring achievements, 
<A NAME="135"></A>Vardanes traversed 375 miles in two days, and drove before him the surprised 
<A NAME="136"></A>and terrified Gotarzes. Without moment's delay, he seized the neighbouring 
<A NAME="137"></A>governments, Seleucia alone refusing his rule. Rage against the place, 
<A NAME="138"></A>which indeed had also revolted from his father, rather than considerations 
<A NAME="139"></A>of policy, made him embarrass himself with the siege of a strong city, 
<A NAME="140"></A>which the defence of a river flowing by it, with fortifications and supplies, 
<A NAME="141"></A>had thoroughly secured. Gotarzes meanwhile, aided by the resources of the 
<A NAME="142"></A>Dahae and Hyrcanians, renewed the war; and Vardanes, compelled to raise 
<A NAME="143"></A>the siege of Seleucia, encamped on the plains of Bactria.
<A NAME="144"></A><BR><BR>Then it was that while the forces of the East were divided, and 
<A NAME="145"></A>hesitated which side they should take, the opportunity of occupying Armenia 
<A NAME="146"></A>was presented to Mithridates, who had the vigorous soldiers of Rome to 
<A NAME="147"></A>storm the fortified heights, while his Iberian cavalry scoured the plain. 
<A NAME="148"></A>The Armenians made no resistance after their governor, Demonax, had ventured 
<A NAME="149"></A>on a battle and had been routed. Cotys, king of Lesser Armenia, to whom 
<A NAME="150"></A>some of the nobles inclined, caused some delay, but he was stopped by a 
<A NAME="151"></A>despatch from Claudius, and then everything passed into the hands of Mithridates, 
<A NAME="152"></A>who showed more cruelty than was wise in a new ruler. The Parthian princes 
<A NAME="153"></A>however, just when they were beginning battle, came to a sudden agreement, 
<A NAME="154"></A>on discovering a plot among their people, which Gotarzes revealed to his 
<A NAME="155"></A>brother. At first they approached each other with hesitation; then, joining 
<A NAME="156"></A>right hands, they promised before the altars of their gods to punish the 
<A NAME="157"></A>treachery of their enemies and to yield one to the other. Vardanes seemed 
<A NAME="158"></A>more capable of retaining rule. Gotarzes, to avoid all rivalry, retired 
<A NAME="159"></A>into the depths of Hyrcania. When Vardanes returned, Seleucia capitulated 
<A NAME="160"></A>to him, seven years after its revolt, little to the credit of the Parthians, 
<A NAME="161"></A>whom a single city had so long defied.
<A NAME="162"></A><BR><BR>He then visited the strongest governments, and was eager to recover 
<A NAME="163"></A>Armenia, but was stopped by Vibius Marsus, governor of Syria, who threatened 
<A NAME="164"></A>war. Meanwhile Gotarzes, who repented of having relinquished his throne, 
<A NAME="165"></A>at the solicitation of the nobility, to whom subjection is a special hardship 
<A NAME="166"></A>in peace, collected a force. Vardanes marched against him to the river 
<A NAME="167"></A>Charinda; a fierce battle was fought over the passage, Vardanes winning 
<A NAME="168"></A>a complete victory, and in a series of successful engagements subduing 
<A NAME="169"></A>the intermediate tribes as far as the river Sindes, which is the boundary 
<A NAME="170"></A>between the Dahae and the Arians. There his successes terminated. The Parthians, 
<A NAME="171"></A>victorious though they were, rebelled against distant service. So after 
<A NAME="172"></A>erecting monuments on which he recorded his greatness, and the tribute 
<A NAME="173"></A>won from peoples from whom no Arsacid had won it before, he returned covered 
<A NAME="174"></A>with glory, and therefore the more haughty and more intolerable to his 
<A NAME="175"></A>subjects than ever. They arranged a plot, and slew him when he was off 
<A NAME="176"></A>his guard and intent upon the chase. He was still in his first youth, and 
<A NAME="177"></A>might have been one of the illustrious few among aged princes, had he sought 
<A NAME="178"></A>to be loved by his subjects as much as to be feared by his 
<A NAME="179"></A>foes.
<A NAME="180"></A><BR><BR>The murder of Vardanes threw the affairs of Parthia into confusion, 
<A NAME="181"></A>as the people were in doubt who should be summoned to the throne. Many 
<A NAME="182"></A>inclined to Gotarzes, some to Meherdates, a descendant of Phraates, who 
<A NAME="183"></A>was a hostage in our hands. Finally Gotarzes prevailed. Established in 
<A NAME="184"></A>the palace, he drove the Parthians by his cruelty and profligacy to send 
<A NAME="185"></A>a secret entreaty to the Roman emperor that Meherdates might be allowed 
<A NAME="186"></A>to mount the throne of his ancestors.
<A NAME="187"></A><BR><BR>It was during this consulship, in the eight hundredth year after 
<A NAME="188"></A>the foundation of Rome and the sixty-fourth after their celebration by 
<A NAME="189"></A>Augustus that the secular games were exhibited. I say nothing of the calculations 
<A NAME="190"></A>of the two princes, which I have sufficiently discussed in my history of 
<A NAME="191"></A>the emperor Domitian; for he also exhibited secular games, at which indeed, 
<A NAME="192"></A>being one of the priesthood of the Fifteen and praetor at the time, I specially 
<A NAME="193"></A>assisted. It is in no boastful spirit that I mention this, but because 
<A NAME="194"></A>this duty has immemorially belonged to the College of the Fifteen, and 
<A NAME="195"></A>the praetors have performed the chief functions in these ceremonies. While 
<A NAME="196"></A>Claudius sat to witness the games of the circus, some of the young nobility 
<A NAME="197"></A>acted on horseback the battle of Troy. Among them was Britannicus, the 
<A NAME="198"></A>emperor's son, and Lucius Domitius, who became soon afterwards by adoption 
<A NAME="199"></A>heir to the empire with the surname of Nero. The stronger popular enthusiasm 
<A NAME="200"></A>which greeted him was taken to presage his greatness. It was commonly reported 
<A NAME="201"></A>that snakes had been seen by his cradle, which they seemed to guard, a 
<A NAME="202"></A>fabulous tale invented to match the marvels of other lands. Nero, never 
<A NAME="203"></A>a disparager of himself, was wont to say that but one snake, at most, had 
<A NAME="204"></A>been seen in his chamber.
<A NAME="205"></A><BR><BR>Something however of popular favour was bequeathed to him from 
<A NAME="206"></A>the remembrance of Germanicus, whose only male descendant he was, and the 
<A NAME="207"></A>pity felt for his mother Agrippina was increased by the cruelty of Messalina, 
<A NAME="208"></A>who, always her enemy, and then more furious than ever, was only kept from 
<A NAME="209"></A>planning an accusation and suborning informers by a new and almost insane 
<A NAME="210"></A>passion. She had grown so frantically enamoured of Caius Silius, the handsomest 
<A NAME="211"></A>of the young nobility of Rome, that she drove from his bed Junia Silana, 
<A NAME="212"></A>a high-born lady, and had her lover wholly to herself. Silius was not unconscious 
<A NAME="213"></A>of his wickedness and his peril; but a refusal would have insured destruction, 
<A NAME="214"></A>and he had some hope of escaping exposure; the prize too was great, so 
<A NAME="215"></A>he consoled himself by awaiting the future and enjoying the present. As 
<A NAME="216"></A>for her, careless of concealment, she went continually with a numerous 
<A NAME="217"></A>retinue to his house, she haunted his steps, showered on him wealth and 
<A NAME="218"></A>honours, and, at last, as though empire had passed to another, the slaves, 
<A NAME="219"></A>the freedmen, the very furniture of the emperor were to be seen in the 
<A NAME="220"></A>possession of the paramour.
<A NAME="221"></A><BR><BR>Claudius meanwhile, who knew nothing about his wife, and was busy 
<A NAME="222"></A>with his functions as censor, published edicts severely rebuking the lawlessness 
<A NAME="223"></A>of the people in the theatre, when they insulted Caius Pomponius, an ex-consul, 
<A NAME="224"></A>who furnished verses for the stage, and certain ladies of rank. He introduced 
<A NAME="225"></A>too a law restraining the cruel greed of the usurers, and forbidding them 
<A NAME="226"></A>to lend at interest sums repayable on a father's death. He also conveyed 
<A NAME="227"></A>by an aqueduct into Rome the waters which flow from the hills of Simbrua. 
<A NAME="228"></A>And he likewise invented and published for use some new letters, having 
<A NAME="229"></A>discovered, as he said, that even the Greek alphabet had not been completed 
<A NAME="230"></A>at once.
<A NAME="231"></A><BR><BR>It was the Egyptians who first symbolized ideas, and that by the 
<A NAME="232"></A>figures of animals. These records, the most ancient of all human history, 
<A NAME="233"></A>are still seen engraved on stone. The Egyptians also claim to have invented 
<A NAME="234"></A>the alphabet, which the Phoenicians, they say, by means of their superior 
<A NAME="235"></A>seamanship, introduced into Greece, and of which they appropriated the 
<A NAME="236"></A>glory, giving out that they had discovered what they had really been taught. 
<A NAME="237"></A>Tradition indeed says that Cadmus, visiting Greece in a Phoenician fleet, 
<A NAME="238"></A>was the teacher of this art to its yet barbarous tribes. According to one 
<A NAME="239"></A>account, it was Cecrops of Athens or Linus of Thebes, or Palamedes of Argos 
<A NAME="240"></A>in Trojan times who invented the shapes of sixteen letters, and others, 
<A NAME="241"></A>chiefly Simonides, added the rest. In Italy the Etrurians learnt them from 
<A NAME="242"></A>Demaratus of Corinth, and the Aborigines from the Arcadian Evander. And 
<A NAME="243"></A>so the Latin letters have the same form as the oldest Greek characters. 
<A NAME="244"></A>At first too our alphabet was scanty, and additions were afterwards made. 
<A NAME="245"></A>Following this precedent Claudius added three letters, which were employed 
<A NAME="246"></A>during his reign and subsequently disused. These may still be seen on the 
<A NAME="247"></A>tablets of brass set up in the squares and temples, on which new statutes 
<A NAME="248"></A>are published.
<A NAME="249"></A><BR><BR>Claudius then brought before the Senate the subject of the college 
<A NAME="250"></A>of "haruspices," that, as he said, "the oldest of Italian sciences might 
<A NAME="251"></A>not be lost through negligence. It had often happened in evil days for 
<A NAME="252"></A>the State that advisers had been summoned at whose suggestion ceremonies 
<A NAME="253"></A>had been restored and observed more duly for the future. The nobles of 
<A NAME="254"></A>Etruria, whether of their own accord or at the instigation of the Roman 
<A NAME="255"></A>Senate, had retained this science, making it the inheritance of distinct 
<A NAME="256"></A>families. It was now less zealously studied through the general indifference 
<A NAME="257"></A>to all sound learning and to the growth of foreign superstitions. At present 
<A NAME="258"></A>all is well, but we must show gratitude to the favour of Heaven, by taking 
<A NAME="259"></A>care that the rites observed during times of peril may not be forgotten 
<A NAME="260"></A>in prosperity." A resolution of the Senate was accordingly passed, charging 
<A NAME="261"></A>the pontiffs to see what should be retained or reformed with respect to 
<A NAME="262"></A>the "haruspices."
<A NAME="263"></A><BR><BR>It was in this same year that the Cherusci asked Rome for a king. 
<A NAME="264"></A>They had lost all their nobles in their civil wars, and there was left 
<A NAME="265"></A>but one scion of the royal house, Italicus by name, who lived at Rome. 
<A NAME="266"></A>On the father's side he was descended from Flavus, the brother of Arminius; 
<A NAME="267"></A>his mother was a daughter of Catumerus, chief of the Chatti. The youth 
<A NAME="268"></A>himself was of distinguished beauty, a skilful horseman and swordsman both 
<A NAME="269"></A>after our fashion and that of his country. So the emperor made him a present 
<A NAME="270"></A>of money, furnished him with an escort, and bade him enter with a good 
<A NAME="271"></A>heart on the honours of his house. "Never before," he said, "had a native 
<A NAME="272"></A>of Rome, no hostage but a citizen, gone to mount a foreign throne." At 
<A NAME="273"></A>first his arrival was welcome to the Germans, and they crowded to pay him 
<A NAME="274"></A>court, for he was untainted by any spirit of faction, and showed the same 
<A NAME="275"></A>hearty goodwill to all, practising sometimes the courtesy and temperance 
<A NAME="276"></A>which can never offend, but oftener those excesses of wine and lust in 
<A NAME="277"></A>which barbarians delight. He was winning fame among his neighbours and 
<A NAME="278"></A>even far beyond them, when some who had found their fortune in party feuds, 
<A NAME="279"></A>jealous of his power, fled to the tribes on the border, protesting that 
<A NAME="280"></A>Germany was being robbed of her ancient freedom, and that the might of 
<A NAME="281"></A>Rome was on the rise. "Is there really," they said, "no native of this 
<A NAME="282"></A>country to fill the place of king without raising the son of the spy Flavus 
<A NAME="283"></A>above all his fellows? It is idle to put forward the name of Arminius. 
<A NAME="284"></A>Had even the son of Arminius come to the throne after growing to manhood 
<A NAME="285"></A>on a hostile soil, he might well be dreaded, corrupted as he would be by 
<A NAME="286"></A>the bread of dependence, by slavery, by luxury, by all foreign habits. 
<A NAME="287"></A>But if Italicus had his father's spirit, no man, be it remembered, had 
<A NAME="288"></A>ever waged war against his country and his home more savagely than that 
<A NAME="289"></A>father." By these and like appeals they collected a large force. No less 
<A NAME="290"></A>numerous were the partisans of Italicus. "He was no intruder," they said, 
<A NAME="291"></A>"on an unwilling people; he had obeyed a call. Superior as he was to all 
<A NAME="292"></A>others in noble birth, should they not put his valour to the test, and 
<A NAME="293"></A>see whether he showed himself worthy of his uncle Arminius and his grandfather 
<A NAME="294"></A>Catumerus? He need not blush because his father had never relinquished 
<A NAME="295"></A>the loyalty which, with the consent of the Germans, he had promised to 
<A NAME="296"></A>Rome. The name of liberty was a lying pretext in the mouths of men who, 
<A NAME="297"></A>base in private, dangerous in public life, had nothing to hope except from 
<A NAME="298"></A>civil discord."
<A NAME="299"></A><BR><BR>The people enthusiastically applauded him. After a fierce conflict 
<A NAME="300"></A>among the barbarians, the king was victorious. Subsequently, in his good 
<A NAME="301"></A>fortune, he fell into a despot's pride, was dethroned, was restored by 
<A NAME="302"></A>the help of the Langobardi, and still, in prosperity or adversity, did 
<A NAME="303"></A>mischief to the interests of the Cheruscan nation.
<A NAME="304"></A><BR><BR>It was during the same period that the Chauci, free, as it happened, 
<A NAME="305"></A>from dissension at home and emboldened by the death of Sanquinius, made, 
<A NAME="306"></A>while Corbulo was on his way, an inroad into Lower Germany, under the leadership 
<A NAME="307"></A>of Gannascus. This man was of the tribe of the Canninefates, had served 
<A NAME="308"></A>long as our auxiliary, had then deserted, and, getting some light vessels, 
<A NAME="309"></A>had made piratical descents specially on the coast of Gaul, inhabited, 
<A NAME="310"></A>he knew, by a wealthy and unwarlike population. Corbulo meanwhile entered 
<A NAME="311"></A>the province with careful preparation and soon winning a renown of which 
<A NAME="312"></A>that campaign was the beginning, he brought his triremes up the channel 
<A NAME="313"></A>of the Rhine and the rest of his vessels up the estuaries and canals to 
<A NAME="314"></A>which they were adapted. Having sunk the enemy's flotilla, driven out Gannascus, 
<A NAME="315"></A>and brought everything into good order, he restored the discipline of former 
<A NAME="316"></A>days among legions which had forgotten the labours and toils of the soldier 
<A NAME="317"></A>and delighted only in plunder. No one was to fall out of the line; no one 
<A NAME="318"></A>was to fight without orders. At the outposts, on guard, in the duties of 
<A NAME="319"></A>day and of night, they were always to be under arms. One soldier, it was 
<A NAME="320"></A>said, had suffered death for working at the trenches without his sword, 
<A NAME="321"></A>another for wearing nothing as he dug, but his poniard. These extreme and 
<A NAME="322"></A>possibly false stories at least had their origin in the general's real 
<A NAME="323"></A>severity. We may be sure that he was strict and implacable to serious offences, 
<A NAME="324"></A>when such sternness in regard to trifles could be believed of 
<A NAME="325"></A>him.
<A NAME="326"></A><BR><BR>The fear thus inspired variously affected his own troops and the 
<A NAME="327"></A>enemy. Our men gained fresh valour; the barbarians felt their pride broken. 
<A NAME="328"></A>The Frisians, who had been hostile or disloyal since the revolt which had 
<A NAME="329"></A>been begun by the defeat of Lucius Apronius, gave hostages and settled 
<A NAME="330"></A>down on territories marked out by Corbulo, who, at the same time, gave 
<A NAME="331"></A>them a senate, magistrates, and a constitution. That they might not throw 
<A NAME="332"></A>off their obedience, he built a fort among them, while he sent envoys to 
<A NAME="333"></A>invite the Greater Chauci to submission and to destroy Gannascus by stratagem. 
<A NAME="334"></A>This stealthy attempt on the life of a deserter and a traitor was not unsuccessful, 
<A NAME="335"></A>nor was it anything ignoble. Yet the Chauci were violently roused by the 
<A NAME="336"></A>man's death, and Corbulo was now sowing the seeds of another revolt, thus 
<A NAME="337"></A>getting a reputation which many liked, but of which many thought ill. "Why," 
<A NAME="338"></A>men asked, "was he irritating the foe? His disasters will fall on the State. 
<A NAME="339"></A>If he is successful, so famous a hero will be a danger to peace, and a 
<A NAME="340"></A>formidable subject for a timid emperor." Claudius accordingly forbade fresh 
<A NAME="341"></A>attacks on Germany, so emphatically as to order the garrisons to be withdrawn 
<A NAME="342"></A>to the left bank of the Rhine.
<A NAME="343"></A><BR><BR>Corbulo was actually preparing to encamp on hostile soil when the 
<A NAME="344"></A>despatch reached him. Surprised, as he was, and many as were the thoughts 
<A NAME="345"></A>which crowded on him, thoughts of peril from the emperor, of scorn from 
<A NAME="346"></A>the barbarians, of ridicule from the allies, he said nothing but this, 
<A NAME="347"></A>"Happy the Roman generals of old," and gave the signal for retreat. To 
<A NAME="348"></A>keep his soldiers free from sloth, he dug a canal of twenty-three miles 
<A NAME="349"></A>in length between the Rhine and the Meuse, as a means of avoiding the uncertain 
<A NAME="350"></A>perils of the ocean. The emperor, though he had forbidden war, yet granted 
<A NAME="351"></A>him triumphal distinctions.
<A NAME="352"></A><BR><BR>Soon afterwards Curtius Rufus obtained the same honour. He had 
<A NAME="353"></A>opened mines in the territory of the Mattiaci for working certain veins 
<A NAME="354"></A>of silver. The produce was small and soon exhausted. The toil meanwhile 
<A NAME="355"></A>of the legions was only to a loss, while they dug channels for water and 
<A NAME="356"></A>constructed below the surface works which are difficult enough in the open 
<A NAME="357"></A>air. Worn out by the labour, and knowing that similar hardships were endured 
<A NAME="358"></A>in several provinces, the soldiers wrote a secret despatch in the name 
<A NAME="359"></A>of the armies, begging the emperor to give in advance triumphal distinctions 
<A NAME="360"></A>to one to whom he was about to entrust his forces.
<A NAME="361"></A><BR><BR>Of the birth of Curtius Rufus, whom some affirm to have been the 
<A NAME="362"></A>son of a gladiator, I would not publish a falsehood, while I shrink from 
<A NAME="363"></A>telling the truth. On reaching manhood he attached himself to a quaestor 
<A NAME="364"></A>to whom Africa had been allotted, and was walking alone at midday in some 
<A NAME="365"></A>unfrequented arcade in the town of Adrumetum, when he saw a female figure 
<A NAME="366"></A>of more than human stature, and heard a voice, "Thou, Rufus, art the man 
<A NAME="367"></A>who will one day come into this province as proconsul." Raised high in 
<A NAME="368"></A>hope by such a presage, he returned to Rome, where, through the lavish 
<A NAME="369"></A>expenditure of his friends and his own vigorous ability, he obtained the 
<A NAME="370"></A>quaestorship, and, subsequently, in competition with well-born candidates, 
<A NAME="371"></A>the praetorship, by the vote of the emperor Tiberius, who threw a veil 
<A NAME="372"></A>over the discredit of his origin, saying, "Curtius Rufus seems to me to 
<A NAME="373"></A>be his own ancestor." Afterwards, throughout a long old age of surly sycophancy 
<A NAME="374"></A>to those above him, of arrogance to those beneath him, and of moroseness 
<A NAME="375"></A>among his equals, he gained the high office of the consulship, triumphal 
<A NAME="376"></A>distinctions, and, at last, the province of Africa. There he died, and 
<A NAME="377"></A>so fulfilled the presage of his destiny.
<A NAME="378"></A><BR><BR>At Rome meanwhile, without any motive then known or subsequently 
<A NAME="379"></A>ascertained, Cneius Nonius, a Roman knight, was found wearing a sword amid 
<A NAME="380"></A>a crowd who were paying their respects to the emperor. The man confessed 
<A NAME="381"></A>his own guilt when he was being torn in pieces by torture, but gave up 
<A NAME="382"></A>no accomplices, perhaps having none to hide.
<A NAME="383"></A><BR><BR>During the same consulship, Publius Dolabella proposed that a spectacle 
<A NAME="384"></A>of gladiators should be annually exhibited at the cost of those who obtained 
<A NAME="385"></A>the quaestorship. In our ancestors' days this honour had been a reward 
<A NAME="386"></A>of virtue, and every citizen, with good qualities to support him, was allowed 
<A NAME="387"></A>to compete for office. At first there were no distinctions even of age, 
<A NAME="388"></A>which prevented a man in his early youth from becoming a consul or a dictator. 
<A NAME="389"></A>The quaestors indeed were appointed while the kings still ruled, and this 
<A NAME="390"></A>the revival by Brutus of the lex curiata plainly shows. The consuls retained 
<A NAME="391"></A>the power of selecting them, till the people bestowed this office as well 
<A NAME="392"></A>as others. The first so created were Valerius Potitus and Aemilius Mamercus 
<A NAME="393"></A>sixty-three years after the expulsion of the Tarquins, and they were to 
<A NAME="394"></A>be attached to the war-department. As the public business increased, two 
<A NAME="395"></A>more were appointed to attend to affairs at Rome. This number was again 
<A NAME="396"></A>doubled, when to the contributions of Italy was added the tribute of the 
<A NAME="397"></A>provinces. Subsequently Sulla, by one of his laws, provided that twenty 
<A NAME="398"></A>should be elected to fill up the Senate, to which he had intrusted judicial 
<A NAME="399"></A>functions. These functions the knights afterwards recovered, but the quaestorship 
<A NAME="400"></A>was obtained, without expense, by merit in the candidates or by the good 
<A NAME="401"></A>nature of the electors, till at Dolabella's suggestion it was, so to speak, 
<A NAME="402"></A>put up to sale.
<A NAME="403"></A><BR><BR>In the consulship of Aulus Vitellius and Lucius Vipstanus the question 
<A NAME="404"></A>of filling up the Senate was discussed, and the chief men of Gallia Comata, 
<A NAME="405"></A>as it was called, who had long possessed the rights of allies and of Roman 
<A NAME="406"></A>citizens, sought the privilege of obtaining public offices at Rome. There 
<A NAME="407"></A>was much talk of every kind on the subject, and it was argued before the 
<A NAME="408"></A>emperor with vehement opposition. "Italy," it was asserted, "is not so 
<A NAME="409"></A>feeble as to be unable to furnish its own capital with a senate. Once our 
<A NAME="410"></A>native-born citizens sufficed for peoples of our own kin, and we are by 
<A NAME="411"></A>no means dissatisfied with the Rome of the past. To this day we cite examples, 
<A NAME="412"></A>which under our old customs the Roman character exhibited as to valour 
<A NAME="413"></A>and renown. Is it a small thing that Veneti and Insubres have already burst 
<A NAME="414"></A>into the Senate-house, unless a mob of foreigners, a troop of captives, 
<A NAME="415"></A>so to say, is now forced upon us? What distinctions will be left for the 
<A NAME="416"></A>remnants of our noble houses, or for any impoverished senators from Latium? 
<A NAME="417"></A>Every place will be crowded with these millionaires, whose ancestors of 
<A NAME="418"></A>the second and third generations at the head of hostile tribes destroyed 
<A NAME="419"></A>our armies with fire and sword, and actually besieged the divine Julius 
<A NAME="420"></A>at Alesia. These are recent memories. What if there were to rise up the 
<A NAME="421"></A>remembrance of those who fell in Rome's citadel and at her altar by the 
<A NAME="422"></A>hands of these same barbarians! Let them enjoy indeed the title of citizens, 
<A NAME="423"></A>but let them not vulgarise the distinctions of the Senate and the honours 
<A NAME="424"></A>of office."
<A NAME="425"></A><BR><BR>These and like arguments failed to impress the emperor. He at once 
<A NAME="426"></A>addressed himself to answer them, and thus harangued the assembled Senate. 
<A NAME="427"></A>"My ancestors, the most ancient of whom was made at once a citizen and 
<A NAME="428"></A>a noble of Rome, encourage me to govern by the same policy of transferring 
<A NAME="429"></A>to this city all conspicuous merit, wherever found. And indeed I know, 
<A NAME="430"></A>as facts, that the Julii came from Alba, the Coruncanii from Camerium, 
<A NAME="431"></A>the Porcii from Tusculum, and not to inquire too minutely into the past, 
<A NAME="432"></A>that new members have been brought into the Senate from Etruria and Lucania 
<A NAME="433"></A>and the whole of Italy, that Italy itself was at last extended to the Alps, 
<A NAME="434"></A>to the end that not only single persons but entire countries and tribes 
<A NAME="435"></A>might be united under our name. We had unshaken peace at home; we prospered 
<A NAME="436"></A>in all our foreign relations, in the days when Italy beyond the Po was 
<A NAME="437"></A>admitted to share our citizenship, and when, enrolling in our ranks the 
<A NAME="438"></A>most vigorous of the provincials, under colour of settling our legions 
<A NAME="439"></A>throughout the world, we recruited our exhausted empire. Are we sorry that 
<A NAME="440"></A>the Balbi came to us from Spain, and other men not less illustrious from 
<A NAME="441"></A>Narbon Gaul? Their descendants are still among us, and do not yield to 
<A NAME="442"></A>us in patriotism.
<A NAME="443"></A><BR><BR>"What was the ruin of Sparta and Athens, but this, that mighty 
<A NAME="444"></A>as they were in war, they spurned from them as aliens those whom they had 
<A NAME="445"></A>conquered? Our founder Romulus, on the other hand, was so wise that he 
<A NAME="446"></A>fought as enemies and then hailed as fellow-citizens several nations on 
<A NAME="447"></A>the very same day. Strangers have reigned over us. That freedmen's sons 
<A NAME="448"></A>should be intrusted with public offices is not, as many wrongly think, 
<A NAME="449"></A>a sudden innovation, but was a common practice in the old commonwealth. 
<A NAME="450"></A>But, it will be said, we have fought with the Senones. I suppose then that 
<A NAME="451"></A>the Volsci and Aequi never stood in array against us. Our city was taken 
<A NAME="452"></A>by the Gauls. Well, we also gave hostages to the Etruscans, and passed 
<A NAME="453"></A>under the yoke of the Samnites. On the whole, if you review all our wars, 
<A NAME="454"></A>never has one been finished in a shorter time than that with the Gauls. 
<A NAME="455"></A>Thenceforth they have preserved an unbroken and loyal peace. United as 
<A NAME="456"></A>they now are with us by manners, education, and intermarriage, let them 
<A NAME="457"></A>bring us their gold and their wealth rather than enjoy it in isolation. 
<A NAME="458"></A>Everything, Senators, which we now hold to be of the highest antiquity, 
<A NAME="459"></A>was once new. Plebeian magistrates came after patrician; Latin magistrates 
<A NAME="460"></A>after plebeian; magistrates of other Italian peoples after Latin. This 
<A NAME="461"></A>practice too will establish itself, and what we are this day justifying 
<A NAME="462"></A>by precedents, will be itself a precedent."
<A NAME="463"></A><BR><BR>The emperor's speech was followed by a decree of the Senate, and 
<A NAME="464"></A>the Aedui were the first to obtain the right of becoming senators at Rome. 
<A NAME="465"></A>This compliment was paid to their ancient alliance, and to the fact that 
<A NAME="466"></A>they alone of the Gauls cling to the name of brothers of the Roman 
<A NAME="467"></A>people.
<A NAME="468"></A><BR><BR>About the same time the emperor enrolled in the ranks of the patricians 
<A NAME="469"></A>such senators as were of the oldest families, and such as had had distinguished 
<A NAME="470"></A>ancestors. There were now but scanty relics of the Greater Houses of Romulus 
<A NAME="471"></A>and of the Lesser Houses of Lucius Brutus, as they had been called, and 
<A NAME="472"></A>those too were exhausted which the Dictator Caesar by the Cassian and the 
<A NAME="473"></A>emperor Augustus by the Saenian law had chosen into their place. These 
<A NAME="474"></A>acts, as being welcome to the State, were undertaken with hearty gladness 
<A NAME="475"></A>by the imperial censor. Anxiously considering how he was to rid the Senate 
<A NAME="476"></A>of men of notorious infamy, he preferred a gentle method, recently devised, 
<A NAME="477"></A>to one which accorded with the sternness of antiquity, and advised each 
<A NAME="478"></A>to examine his own case and seek the privilege of laying aside his rank. 
<A NAME="479"></A>Permission, he said, would be readily obtained. He would publish in the 
<A NAME="480"></A>same list those who had been expelled and those who had been allowed to 
<A NAME="481"></A>retire, that by this confounding together of the decision of the censors 
<A NAME="482"></A>and the modesty of voluntary resignation the disgrace might be 
<A NAME="483"></A>softened.
<A NAME="484"></A><BR><BR>For this, the consul Vipstanus moved that Claudius should be called 
<A NAME="485"></A>"Father of the Senate." The title of "Father of the Country" had, he argued, 
<A NAME="486"></A>been indiscriminately bestowed; new services ought to be recognized by 
<A NAME="487"></A>unusual titles. The emperor, however, himself stopped the consul's flattery, 
<A NAME="488"></A>as extravagant. He closed the lustrum, the census for which gave a total 
<A NAME="489"></A>of 5,984,072 citizens. Then too ended his blindness as to his domestic 
<A NAME="490"></A>affairs. He was soon compelled to notice and punish his wife's infamies, 
<A NAME="491"></A>till he afterwards craved passionately for an unhallowed 
<A NAME="492"></A>union.
<A NAME="493"></A><BR><BR>Messalina, now grown weary of the very facility of her adulteries, 
<A NAME="494"></A>was rushing into strange excesses, when even Silius, either through some 
<A NAME="495"></A>fatal infatuation or because he imagined that, amid the dangers which hung 
<A NAME="496"></A>over him, danger itself was the best safety, urged the breaking off of 
<A NAME="497"></A>all concealment. "They were not," he said, "in such an extremity as to 
<A NAME="498"></A>have to wait for the emperor's old age. Harmless measures were for the 
<A NAME="499"></A>innocent. Crime once exposed had no refuge but in audacity. They had accomplices 
<A NAME="500"></A>in all who feared the same fate. For himself, as he had neither wife nor 
<A NAME="501"></A>child, he was ready to marry and to adopt Britannicus. Messalina would 
<A NAME="502"></A>have the same power as before, with the additional advantage of a quiet 
<A NAME="503"></A>mind, if only they took Claudius by surprise, who, though unsuspicious 
<A NAME="504"></A>of treachery, was hasty in his wrath."
<A NAME="505"></A><BR><BR>The suggestion was coldly received, not because the lady loved 
<A NAME="506"></A>her husband, but from a fear that Silius, after attaining his highest hopes, 
<A NAME="507"></A>would spurn an adulteress, and soon estimate at its true value the crime 
<A NAME="508"></A>which in the midst of peril he had approved. But she craved the name of 
<A NAME="509"></A>wife, for the sake of the monstrous infamy, that last source of delight 
<A NAME="510"></A>to the reckless. She waited only till Claudius set out for Ostia to perform 
<A NAME="511"></A>a sacrifice, and then celebrated all the solemnities of 
<A NAME="512"></A>marriage.
<A NAME="513"></A><BR><BR>I am well aware that it will seem a fable that any persons in the 
<A NAME="514"></A>world could have been so obtuse in a city which knows everything and hides 
<A NAME="515"></A>nothing, much more, that these persons should have been a consul-elect 
<A NAME="516"></A>and the emperor's wife; that, on an appointed day, before witnesses duly 
<A NAME="517"></A>summoned, they should have come together as if for the purpose of legitimate 
<A NAME="518"></A>marriage; that she should have listened to the words of the bridegroom's 
<A NAME="519"></A>friends, should have sacrificed to the gods, have taken her place among 
<A NAME="520"></A>a company of guests, have lavished her kisses and caresses, and passed 
<A NAME="521"></A>the night in the freedom which marriage permits. But this is no story to 
<A NAME="522"></A>excite wonder; I do but relate what I have heard and what our fathers have 
<A NAME="523"></A>recorded.
<A NAME="524"></A><BR><BR>The emperor's court indeed shuddered, its powerful personages especially, 
<A NAME="525"></A>the men who had much to fear from a revolution. From secret whisperings 
<A NAME="526"></A>they passed to loud complaints. "When an actor," they said, "impudently 
<A NAME="527"></A>thrust himself into the imperial chamber, it certainly brought scandal 
<A NAME="528"></A>on the State, but we were a long way from ruin. Now, a young noble of stately 
<A NAME="529"></A>beauty, of vigorous intellect, with the near prospect of the consulship, 
<A NAME="530"></A>is preparing himself for a loftier ambition. There can be no secret about 
<A NAME="531"></A>what is to follow such a marriage." Doubtless there was thrill of alarm 
<A NAME="532"></A>when they thought of the apathy of Claudius, of his devotion to his wife 
<A NAME="533"></A>and of the many murders perpetrated at Messalina's bidding. On the other 
<A NAME="534"></A>hand, the very good nature of the emperor inspired confident hope that 
<A NAME="535"></A>if they could overpower him by the enormity of the charge, she might be 
<A NAME="536"></A>condemned and crushed before she was accused. The critical point was this, 
<A NAME="537"></A>that he should not hear her defence, and that his ears should be shut even 
<A NAME="538"></A>against her confession.
<A NAME="539"></A><BR><BR>At first Callistus, of whom I have already spoken in connection 
<A NAME="540"></A>with the assassination of Caius Caesar, Narcissus, who had contrived the 
<A NAME="541"></A>death of Appius, and Pallas, who was then in the height of favour, debated 
<A NAME="542"></A>whether they might not by secret threats turn Messalina from her passion 
<A NAME="543"></A>for Silius, while they concealed all else. Then fearing that they would 
<A NAME="544"></A>be themselves involved in ruin, they abandoned the idea, Pallas out of 
<A NAME="545"></A>cowardice, and Callistus, from his experience of a former court, remembering 
<A NAME="546"></A>that prudent rather than vigorous counsels insure the maintenance of power. 
<A NAME="547"></A>Narcissus persevered, only so far changing his plan as not to make her 
<A NAME="548"></A>aware beforehand by a single word what was the charge or who was the accuser. 
<A NAME="549"></A>Then he eagerly watched his opportunity, and, as the emperor lingered long 
<A NAME="550"></A>at Ostia, he sought two of the mistresses to whose society Claudius was 
<A NAME="551"></A>especially partial, and, by gifts, by promises, by dwelling on power increased 
<A NAME="552"></A>by the wife's fall, he induced them to undertake the work of the 
<A NAME="553"></A>informer.
<A NAME="554"></A><BR><BR>On this, Calpurnia (that was the woman's name), as soon as she 
<A NAME="555"></A>was allowed a private interview, threw herself at the emperor's knees, 
<A NAME="556"></A>crying out that Messalina was married to Silius. At the same time she asked 
<A NAME="557"></A>Cleopatra, who was standing near and waiting for the question, whether 
<A NAME="558"></A>she knew it. Cleopatra nodding assent, she begged that Narcissus might 
<A NAME="559"></A>be summoned. Narcissus entreated pardon for the past, for having concealed 
<A NAME="560"></A>the scandal while confined to a Vettius or a Plautius. Even now, he said, 
<A NAME="561"></A>he would not make charges of adultery, and seem to be asking back the palace, 
<A NAME="562"></A>the slaves, and the other belongings of imperial rank. These Silius might 
<A NAME="563"></A>enjoy; only, he must give back the wife and annul the act of marriage. 
<A NAME="564"></A>"Do you know," he said "of your divorce? The people, the army, the Senate 
<A NAME="565"></A>saw the marriage of Silius. Act at once, or the new husband is master of 
<A NAME="566"></A>Rome."
<A NAME="567"></A><BR><BR>Claudius then summoned all his most powerful friends. First he 
<A NAME="568"></A>questioned Turranius, superintendent of the corn market; next, Lusius Geta, 
<A NAME="569"></A>who commanded the praetorians. When they confessed the truth, the whole 
<A NAME="570"></A>company clamoured in concert that he must go to the camp, must assure himself 
<A NAME="571"></A>of the praetorian cohorts, must think of safety before he thought of vengeance. 
<A NAME="572"></A>It is quite certain that Claudius was so overwhelmed by terror that he 
<A NAME="573"></A>repeatedly asked whether he was indeed in possession of the empire, whether 
<A NAME="574"></A>Silius was still a subject.
<A NAME="575"></A><BR><BR>Messalina meanwhile, more wildly profligate than ever, was celebrating 
<A NAME="576"></A>in mid-autumn a representation of the vintage in her new home. The presses 
<A NAME="577"></A>were being trodden; the vats were overflowing; women girt with skins were 
<A NAME="578"></A>dancing, as Bacchanals dance in their worship or their frenzy. Messalina 
<A NAME="579"></A>with flowing hair shook the thyrsus, and Silius at her side, crowned with 
<A NAME="580"></A>ivy and wearing the buskin, moved his head to some lascivious chorus. It 
<A NAME="581"></A>is said that one Vettius Valens climbed a very lofty tree in sport, and 
<A NAME="582"></A>when they asked him what he saw, replied, "A terrible storm from Ostia." 
<A NAME="583"></A>Possibly such appearance had begun; perhaps, a word dropped by chance became 
<A NAME="584"></A>a prophecy.
<A NAME="585"></A><BR><BR>Meanwhile no mere rumour but messengers from all parts brought 
<A NAME="586"></A>the news that everything was known to Claudius, and that he was coming, 
<A NAME="587"></A>bent on vengeance. Messalina upon this went to the gardens of Lucullus; 
<A NAME="588"></A>Silius, to conceal his fear, to his business in the forum. The other guests 
<A NAME="589"></A>were flying in all directions when the centurions appeared and put every 
<A NAME="590"></A>one in irons where they found them, either in the public streets or in 
<A NAME="591"></A>hiding. Messalina, though her peril took away all power of thought, promptly 
<A NAME="592"></A>resolved to meet and face her husband, a course in which she had often 
<A NAME="593"></A>found safety; while she bade Britannicus and Octavia hasten to embrace 
<A NAME="594"></A>their father. She besought Vibidia, the eldest of the Vestal Virgins, to 
<A NAME="595"></A>demand audience of the supreme pontiff and to beg for mercy. Meanwhile, 
<A NAME="596"></A>with only three companions, so lonely did she find herself in a moment, 
<A NAME="597"></A>she traversed the whole length of the city, and, mounting on a cart used 
<A NAME="598"></A>to remove garden refuse, proceeded along the road to Ostia; not pitied, 
<A NAME="599"></A>so overpoweringly hideous were her crimes, by a single 
<A NAME="600"></A>person.
<A NAME="601"></A><BR><BR>There was equal alarm on the emperor's side. They put but little 
<A NAME="602"></A>trust in Geta, who commanded the praetorians, a man swayed with good case 
<A NAME="603"></A>to good or evil. Narcissus in concert with others who dreaded the same 
<A NAME="604"></A>fate, declared that the only hope of safety for the emperor lay in his 
<A NAME="605"></A>transferring for that one day the command of the soldiers to one of the 
<A NAME="606"></A>freedmen, and he offered to undertake it himself. And that Claudius might 
<A NAME="607"></A>not be induced by Lucius Vitellius and Largus Caecina to repent, while 
<A NAME="608"></A>he was riding into Rome, he asked and took a seat in the emperor's 
<A NAME="609"></A>carriage.
<A NAME="610"></A><BR><BR>It was currently reported in after times that while the emperor 
<A NAME="611"></A>broke into contradictory exclamations, now inveighing against the infamies 
<A NAME="612"></A>of his wife, and now, returning in thought to the remembrance of his love 
<A NAME="613"></A>and of his infant children, Vitellius said nothing but, "What audacity! 
<A NAME="614"></A>what wickedness!" Narcissus indeed kept pressing him to clear up his ambiguities 
<A NAME="615"></A>and let the truth be known, but still he could not prevail upon him to 
<A NAME="616"></A>utter anything that was not vague and susceptible of any meaning which 
<A NAME="617"></A>might be put on it, or upon Largus Caecina, to do anything but follow his 
<A NAME="618"></A>example. And now Messalina had presented herself, and was insisting that 
<A NAME="619"></A>the emperor should listen to the mother of Octavia and Britannicus, when 
<A NAME="620"></A>the accuser roared out at her the story of Silius and her marriage. At 
<A NAME="621"></A>the same moment, to draw Caesar's eyes away from her, he handed him some 
<A NAME="622"></A>papers which detailed her debaucheries. Soon afterwards, as he was entering 
<A NAME="623"></A>Rome, his children by Messalina were to have shown themselves, had not 
<A NAME="624"></A>Narcissus ordered their removal. Vibidia he could not repel, when, with 
<A NAME="625"></A>a vehemently indignant appeal, she demanded that a wife should not be given 
<A NAME="626"></A>up to death without a hearing. So Narcissus replied that the emperor would 
<A NAME="627"></A>hear her, and that she should have an opportunity of disproving the charge. 
<A NAME="628"></A>Meanwhile the holy virgin was to go and discharge her sacred 
<A NAME="629"></A>duties.
<A NAME="630"></A><BR><BR>All throughout, Claudius preserved a strange silence; Vitellius 
<A NAME="631"></A>seemed unconscious. Everything was under the freedman's control. By his 
<A NAME="632"></A>order, the paramour's house was thrown open and the emperor conducted thither. 
<A NAME="633"></A>First, on the threshold, he pointed out the statue of Silius's father, 
<A NAME="634"></A>which a decree of the Senate had directed to be destroyed; next, how the 
<A NAME="635"></A>heirlooms of the Neros and the Drusi had been degraded into the price of 
<A NAME="636"></A>infamy. Then he led the emperor, furious and bursting out in menace, into 
<A NAME="637"></A>the camp, where the soldiers were purposely assembled. Claudius spoke to 
<A NAME="638"></A>them a few words at the dictation of Narcissus. Shame indeed checked the 
<A NAME="639"></A>utterance even of a righteous anger. Instantly there came a shout from 
<A NAME="640"></A>the cohorts, demanding the names of the culprits and their punishment. 
<A NAME="641"></A>Brought before the tribunal, Silius sought neither defence nor delay, but 
<A NAME="642"></A>begged that his death might be hastened. A like courage made several Roman 
<A NAME="643"></A>knights of the first rank desirous of a speedy doom. Titius Proculus, who 
<A NAME="644"></A>had been appointed to watch Messalina and was now offering his evidence, 
<A NAME="645"></A>Vettius Valens, who confessed his guilt, together with Pompeius Urbicus 
<A NAME="646"></A>and Saufellus Trogus from among her accomplices, were ordered to execution. 
<A NAME="647"></A>Decius Calpurnianus too, commander of the watch, Sulpicius Rufus, who had 
<A NAME="648"></A>the charge of the Games, and Juncus Virgilianus, a senator, were similarly 
<A NAME="649"></A>punished.
<A NAME="650"></A><BR><BR>Mnester alone occasioned a pause. Rending off his clothes, he insisted 
<A NAME="651"></A>on Claudius looking at the scars of his stripes and remembering his words 
<A NAME="652"></A>when he surrendered himself, without reserve, to Messalina's bidding. The 
<A NAME="653"></A>guilt of others had been the result of presents or of large promises; his, 
<A NAME="654"></A>of necessity. He must have been the first victim had Silius obtained 
<A NAME="655"></A>empire.
<A NAME="656"></A><BR><BR>Caesar was touched by his appeal and inclined to mercy, but his 
<A NAME="657"></A>freedmen prevailed on him not to let any indulgence be shown to a player 
<A NAME="658"></A>when so many illustrious citizens had fallen. "It mattered not whether 
<A NAME="659"></A>he had sinned so greatly from choice or compulsion." Even the defence of 
<A NAME="660"></A>Traulus Montanus, a Roman knight, was not admitted. A young man of pure 
<A NAME="661"></A>life, yet of singular beauty, he had been summoned and dismissed within 
<A NAME="662"></A>the space of one night by Messalina, who was equally capricious in her 
<A NAME="663"></A>passions and dislikes. In the cases of Suilius Caesoninus and Plautius 
<A NAME="664"></A>Lateranus, the extreme penalty was remitted. The latter was saved by the 
<A NAME="665"></A>distinguished services of his uncle; the former by his very vices, having 
<A NAME="666"></A>amid that abominable throng submitted to the worst degradation.
<A NAME="667"></A><BR><BR>Messalina meanwhile, in the gardens of Lucullus, was struggling 
<A NAME="668"></A>for life, and writing letters of entreaty, as she alternated between hope 
<A NAME="669"></A>arid fury. In her extremity, it was her pride alone which forsook her. 
<A NAME="670"></A>Had not Narcissus hurried on her death, ruin would have recoiled on her 
<A NAME="671"></A>accuser. Claudius had returned home to an early banquet; then, in softened 
<A NAME="672"></A>mood, when the wine had warmed him, he bade some one go and tell the "poor 
<A NAME="673"></A>creature" (this is the word which they say he used) to come the morrow 
<A NAME="674"></A>and plead her cause. Hearing this, seeing too that his wrath was subsiding 
<A NAME="675"></A>and his passion returning, and fearing, in the event of delay, the effect 
<A NAME="676"></A>of approaching night and conjugal recollections, Narcissus rushed out, 
<A NAME="677"></A>and ordered the centurions and the tribunes, who were on guard, to accomplish 
<A NAME="678"></A>the deed of blood. Such, he said, was the emperor's bidding. Evodus, one 
<A NAME="679"></A>of the freedmen, was appointed to watch and complete the affair. Hurrying 
<A NAME="680"></A>on before with all speed to the gardens, he found Messalina stretched upon 
<A NAME="681"></A>the ground, while by her side sat Lepida, her mother, who, though estranged 
<A NAME="682"></A>from her daughter in prosperity, was now melted to pity by her inevitable 
<A NAME="683"></A>doom, and urged her not to wait for the executioner. "Life," she said, 
<A NAME="684"></A>"was over; all that could be looked for was honour in death." But in that 
<A NAME="685"></A>heart, utterly corrupted by profligacy, nothing noble remained. She still 
<A NAME="686"></A>prolonged her tears and idle complaints, till the gates were forced open 
<A NAME="687"></A>by the rush of the new comers, and there stood at her side the tribune, 
<A NAME="688"></A>sternly silent, and the freedman, overwhelming her with the copious insults 
<A NAME="689"></A>of a servile tongue.
<A NAME="690"></A><BR><BR>Then for the first time she understood her fate and put her hand 
<A NAME="691"></A>to a dagger. In her terror she was applying it ineffectually to her throat 
<A NAME="692"></A>and breast, when a blow from the tribune drove it through her. Her body 
<A NAME="693"></A>was given up to her mother. Claudius was still at the banquet when they 
<A NAME="694"></A>told him that Messalina was dead, without mentioning whether it was by 
<A NAME="695"></A>her own or another's hand. Nor did he ask the question, but called for 
<A NAME="696"></A>the cup and finished his repast as usual. During the days which followed 
<A NAME="697"></A>he showed no sign of hatred or joy or anger or sadness, in a word, of any 
<A NAME="698"></A>human emotion, either when he looked on her triumphant accusers or on her 
<A NAME="699"></A>weeping children. The Senate assisted his forgetfulness by decreeing that 
<A NAME="700"></A>her name and her statues should be removed from all places, public or private. 
<A NAME="701"></A>To Narcissus were voted the decorations of the quaestorship, a mere trifle 
<A NAME="702"></A>to the pride of one who rose in the height of his power above Pallas and 
<A NAME="703"></A>Callistus.
