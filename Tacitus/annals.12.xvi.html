<A NAME="start"></A>
<A NAME="10"></A>A.D. 65, 66
<A NAME="11"></A><BR><BR>Fortune soon afterwards made a dupe of Nero through his own credulity 
<A NAME="12"></A>and the promises of Caesellius Bassus, a Carthaginian by birth and a man 
<A NAME="13"></A>of a crazed imagination, who wrested a vision seen in the slumber of night 
<A NAME="14"></A>into a confident expectation. He sailed to Rome, and having purchased admission 
<A NAME="15"></A>to the emperor, he explained how he had discovered on his land a cave of 
<A NAME="16"></A>immense depth, which contained a vast quantity of gold, not in the form 
<A NAME="17"></A>of coin, but in the shapeless and ponderous masses of ancient days. In 
<A NAME="18"></A>fact, he said, ingots of great weight lay there, with bars standing near 
<A NAME="19"></A>them in another part of the cave, a treasure hidden for so many ages to 
<A NAME="20"></A>increase the wealth of the present. Phoenician Dido, as he sought to show 
<A NAME="21"></A>by inference, after fleeing from Tyre and founding Carthage, had concealed 
<A NAME="22"></A>these riches in the fear that a new people might be demoralised by a superabundance 
<A NAME="23"></A>of money, or that the Numidian kings, already for other reasons hostile, 
<A NAME="24"></A>might by lust of gold be provoked to war.
<A NAME="25"></A><BR><BR>Nero upon this, without sufficiently examining the credibility 
<A NAME="26"></A>of the author of the story, or of the matter itself, or sending persons 
<A NAME="27"></A>through whom he might ascertain whether the intelligence was true, himself 
<A NAME="28"></A>actually encouraged the report and despatched men to bring the spoil, as 
<A NAME="29"></A>if it were already acquired. They had triremes assigned them and crews 
<A NAME="30"></A>specially selected to promote speed. Nothing else at the time was the subject 
<A NAME="31"></A>of the credulous gossip of the people, and of the very different conversation 
<A NAME="32"></A>of thinking persons. It happened, too, that the quinquennial games were 
<A NAME="33"></A>being celebrated for the second time, and the orators took from this same 
<A NAME="34"></A>incident their chief materials for eulogies on the emperor. "Not only," 
<A NAME="35"></A>they said, "were there the usual harvests, and the gold of the mine with 
<A NAME="36"></A>its alloy, but the earth now teemed with a new abundance, and wealth was 
<A NAME="37"></A>thrust on them by the bounty of the gods." These and other servile flatteries 
<A NAME="38"></A>they invented, with consummate eloquence and equal sycophancy, confidently 
<A NAME="39"></A>counting on the facility of his belief.
<A NAME="40"></A><BR><BR>Extravagance meanwhile increased, on the strength of a chimerical 
<A NAME="41"></A>hope, and ancient wealth was wasted, as apparently the emperor had lighted 
<A NAME="42"></A>on treasures he might squander for many a year. He even gave away profusely 
<A NAME="43"></A>from this source, and the expectation of riches was one of the causes of 
<A NAME="44"></A>the poverty of the State. Bassus indeed dug up his land and extensive plains 
<A NAME="45"></A>in the neighbourhood, while he persisted that this or that was the place 
<A NAME="46"></A>of the promised cave, and was followed not only by our soldiers but by 
<A NAME="47"></A>the rustic population who were engaged to execute the work, till at last 
<A NAME="48"></A>he threw off his infatuation, and expressing wonder that his dreams had 
<A NAME="49"></A>never before been false, and that now for the first time he had been deluded, 
<A NAME="50"></A>he escaped disgrace and danger by a voluntary death. Some have said that 
<A NAME="51"></A>he was imprisoned and soon released, his property having been taken from 
<A NAME="52"></A>him as a substitute for the royal treasure.
<A NAME="53"></A><BR><BR>Meanwhile the Senate, as they were now on the eve of the quinquennial 
<A NAME="54"></A>contest, wishing to avert scandal, offered the emperor the "victory in 
<A NAME="55"></A>song," and added the "crown of eloquence," that thus a veil might be thrown 
<A NAME="56"></A>over a shameful exposure on the stage. Nero, however, repeatedly declared 
<A NAME="57"></A>that he wanted neither favour nor the Senate's influence, as he was a match 
<A NAME="58"></A>for his rivals, and was certain, in the conscientious opinion of the judges, 
<A NAME="59"></A>to win the honour by merit. First, he recited a poem on the stage; then, 
<A NAME="60"></A>at the importunate request of the rabble that he would make public property 
<A NAME="61"></A>of all his accomplishments (these were their words), he entered the theatre, 
<A NAME="62"></A>and conformed to all the laws of harp-playing, not sitting down when tired, 
<A NAME="63"></A>nor wiping off the perspiration with anything but the garment he wore, 
<A NAME="64"></A>or letting himself be seen to spit or clear his nostrils. Last of all, 
<A NAME="65"></A>on bended knee he saluted the assembly with a motion of the hand, and awaited 
<A NAME="66"></A>the verdict of the judges with pretended anxiety. And then the city-populace, 
<A NAME="67"></A>who were wont to encourage every gesture even of actors, made the place 
<A NAME="68"></A>ring with measured strains of elaborate applause. One would have thought 
<A NAME="69"></A>they were rejoicing, and perhaps they did rejoice, in their indifference 
<A NAME="70"></A>to the public disgrace.
<A NAME="71"></A><BR><BR>All, however, who were present from remote towns, and still retained 
<A NAME="72"></A>the Italy of strict morals and primitive ways; all too who had come on 
<A NAME="73"></A>embassies or on private business from distant provinces, where they had 
<A NAME="74"></A>been unused to such wantonness, were unable to endure the spectacle or 
<A NAME="75"></A>sustain the degrading fatigue, which wearied their unpractised hands, while 
<A NAME="76"></A>they disturbed those who knew their part, and were often struck by soldiers, 
<A NAME="77"></A>stationed in the seats, to see that not a moment of time passed with less 
<A NAME="78"></A>vigorous applause or in the silence of indifference. It was a known fact 
<A NAME="79"></A>that several knights, in struggling through the narrow approaches and the 
<A NAME="80"></A>pressure of the crowd, were trampled to death, and that others while keeping 
<A NAME="81"></A>their seats day and night were seized with some fatal malady. For it was 
<A NAME="82"></A>a still worse danger to be absent from the show, as many openly and many 
<A NAME="83"></A>more secretly made it their business to scrutinize names and faces, and 
<A NAME="84"></A>to note the delight or the disgust of the company. Hence came cruel severities, 
<A NAME="85"></A>immediately exercised on the humble, and resentments, concealed for the 
<A NAME="86"></A>moment, but subsequently paid off, towards men of distinction. There was 
<A NAME="87"></A>a story that Vespasian was insulted by Phoebus, a freedman, for closing 
<A NAME="88"></A>his eyes in a doze, and that having with difficulty been screened by the 
<A NAME="89"></A>intercessions of the well disposed, he escaped imminent destruction through 
<A NAME="90"></A>his grander destiny.
<A NAME="91"></A><BR><BR>After the conclusion of the games Poppaea died from a casual outburst 
<A NAME="92"></A>of rage in her husband, who felled her with a kick when she was pregnant. 
<A NAME="93"></A>That there was poison I cannot believe, though some writers so relate, 
<A NAME="94"></A>from hatred rather than from belief, for the emperor was desirous of children, 
<A NAME="95"></A>and wholly swayed by love of his wife. Her body was not consumed by fire 
<A NAME="96"></A>according to Roman usage, but after the custom of foreign princes was filled 
<A NAME="97"></A>with fragrant spices and embalmed, and then consigned to the sepulchre 
<A NAME="98"></A>of the Julii. She had, however, a public funeral, and Nero himself from 
<A NAME="99"></A>the rostra eulogized her beauty, her lot in having been the mother of a 
<A NAME="100"></A>deified child, and fortune's other gifts, as though they were 
<A NAME="101"></A>virtues.
<A NAME="102"></A><BR><BR>To the death of Poppaea, which, though a public grief, was a delight 
<A NAME="103"></A>to those who recalling the past thought of her shamelessness and cruelty, 
<A NAME="104"></A>Nero added fresh and greater odium by forbidding Caius Cassius to attend 
<A NAME="105"></A>the funeral. This was the first token of mischief. Nor was it long delayed. 
<A NAME="106"></A>Silanus was coupled with Cassius, no crime being alleged, but that Cassius 
<A NAME="107"></A>was eminent for his ancestral wealth and dignity of character, Silanus 
<A NAME="108"></A>for the nobility of his birth and the quiet demeanour of his youth. The 
<A NAME="109"></A>emperor accordingly sent the Senate a speech in which he argued that both 
<A NAME="110"></A>ought to be removed from the State, and made it a reproach against Cassius 
<A NAME="111"></A>that among his ancestors' busts he had specially revered that of Caius 
<A NAME="112"></A>Cassius, which bore the inscription "to the Party-Leader." In fact, he 
<A NAME="113"></A>had thereby sought to sow the seeds of civil war and revolt from the House 
<A NAME="114"></A>of the Caesars. And that he might not merely avail himself of the memory 
<A NAME="115"></A>of a hated name to stir up strife, he had associated with him Lucius Silanus, 
<A NAME="116"></A>a youth of noble birth and reckless spirit, to whom he might point as an 
<A NAME="117"></A>instrument of revolution.
<A NAME="118"></A><BR><BR>Nero next denounced Silanus himself in the same terms as he had 
<A NAME="119"></A>his uncle Torquatus, implying that he was already arranging the details 
<A NAME="120"></A>of imperial business, and setting freedmen to manage his accounts, papers, 
<A NAME="121"></A>and correspondence, imputations utterly groundless and false. Silanus, 
<A NAME="122"></A>in truth, was intensely apprehensive, and had been frightened into caution 
<A NAME="123"></A>by his uncle's destruction. Nero then procured persons, under the name 
<A NAME="124"></A>of informers, to invent against Lepida, the wife of Cassius and aunt of 
<A NAME="125"></A>Silanus, a charge of incest with her brother's son, and of some ghastly 
<A NAME="126"></A>religious ceremonial. Volcatius Tullinus, and Marcellus Cornelius, senators, 
<A NAME="127"></A>and Fabatus, a Roman knight, were drawn in as accomplices. By an appeal 
<A NAME="128"></A>to the emperor these men eluded an impending doom and subsequently, as 
<A NAME="129"></A>being too insignificant, escaped from Nero, who was busy with crimes on 
<A NAME="130"></A>a far greater scale.
<A NAME="131"></A><BR><BR>The Senate was then consulted and sentences of exile were passed 
<A NAME="132"></A>on Cassius and Silanus. As to Lepida, the emperor was to decide. Cassius 
<A NAME="133"></A>was transported to the island of Sardinia, and he was quietly left to old 
<A NAME="134"></A>age. Silanus was removed to Ostia, whence, it was pretended, he was to 
<A NAME="135"></A>be conveyed to Naxos. He was afterwards confined in a town of Apulia named 
<A NAME="136"></A>Barium. There, as he was wisely enduring a most undeserved calamity, he 
<A NAME="137"></A>was suddenly seized by a centurion sent to slay him. When the man advised 
<A NAME="138"></A>him to sever his veins, he replied that, though he had resolved in his 
<A NAME="139"></A>heart to die, he would not let a cutthroat have the glory of the service. 
<A NAME="140"></A>The centurion seeing that, unarmed as he was, he was very powerful, and 
<A NAME="141"></A>more an enraged than a frightened man, ordered his soldiers to overpower 
<A NAME="142"></A>him. And Silanus failed not to resist and to strike blows, as well as he 
<A NAME="143"></A>could with his bare hands, till he was cut down by the centurion, as though 
<A NAME="144"></A>in battle, with wounds in his breast.
<A NAME="145"></A><BR><BR>With equal courage Lucius Vetus, his mother-in-law Sextia, and 
<A NAME="146"></A>his daughter Pollutia submitted to death. They were hated by the emperor 
<A NAME="147"></A>because they seemed a living reproach to him for the murder of Rubellius 
<A NAME="148"></A>Plautus, son-in-law of Lucius Vetus. But the first opportunity of unmasking 
<A NAME="149"></A>his savage wrath was furnished by Fortunatus, a freedman, who having embezzled 
<A NAME="150"></A>his patron's property, deserted him to become his accuser. He had as his 
<A NAME="151"></A>accomplice Claudius Demianus, whom Vetus, when proconsul of Asia, had imprisoned 
<A NAME="152"></A>for his gross misdeeds, and whom Nero now released as a recompense for 
<A NAME="153"></A>the accusation.
<A NAME="154"></A><BR><BR>When the accused knew this and saw that he and his freedman were 
<A NAME="155"></A>pitted against each other on an equal footing, he retired to his estate 
<A NAME="156"></A>at Formiae. There he was put under the secret surveillance of soldiers. 
<A NAME="157"></A>With him was his daughter, who, to say nothing of the now imminent peril, 
<A NAME="158"></A>had all the fury of a long grief ever since she had seen the murderers 
<A NAME="159"></A>of her husband Plautus. She had clasped his bleeding neck, and still kept 
<A NAME="160"></A>by her the blood-stained apparel, clinging in her widowhood to perpetual 
<A NAME="161"></A>sorrow, and using only such nourishment as might suffice to avert starvation. 
<A NAME="162"></A>Then at her father's bidding she went to Neapolis. And as she was forbidden 
<A NAME="163"></A>to approach Nero, she would haunt his doors; and implore him to hear an 
<A NAME="164"></A>innocent man, and not surrender to a freedman one who had once been his 
<A NAME="165"></A>colleague in the consulship, now pleading with the cries of a woman, now 
<A NAME="166"></A>again forgetting her sex and lifting up her voice in a tone of menace, 
<A NAME="167"></A>till the emperor showed himself unmoved alike by entreaty and 
<A NAME="168"></A>reproach.
<A NAME="169"></A><BR><BR>She therefore told her father by message that she cast hope aside 
<A NAME="170"></A>and yielded to necessity. He was at the same time informed that judicial 
<A NAME="171"></A>proceedings in the Senate and a dreadful sentence were hanging over him. 
<A NAME="172"></A>Some there were who advised him to name the emperor as his chief heir, 
<A NAME="173"></A>and so secure the remainder for his grandchildren. But he spurned the notion, 
<A NAME="174"></A>and unwilling to disgrace a life which had clung to freedom by a final 
<A NAME="175"></A>act of servility, he bestowed on his slaves all his ready money, and ordered 
<A NAME="176"></A>each to convey away for himself whatever he could carry, leaving only three 
<A NAME="177"></A>couches for the last scene. Then in the same chamber, with the same weapon, 
<A NAME="178"></A>they sundered their veins, and speedily hurried into a bath, covered each, 
<A NAME="179"></A>as delicacy required, with a single garment, the father gazing intently 
<A NAME="180"></A>on his daughter, the grandmother on her grandchild, she again on both, 
<A NAME="181"></A>while with rival earnestness they prayed that the ebbing life might have 
<A NAME="182"></A>a quick departure, each wishing to leave a relative still surviving, but 
<A NAME="183"></A>just on the verge of death. Fortune preserved the due order; the oldest 
<A NAME="184"></A>died first, then the others according to priority of age. They were prosecuted 
<A NAME="185"></A>after their burial, and the sentence was that "they should be punished 
<A NAME="186"></A>in ancient fashion." Nero interposed his veto, allowing them to die without 
<A NAME="187"></A>his interference. Such were the mockeries added to murders already 
<A NAME="188"></A>perpetrated.
<A NAME="189"></A><BR><BR>Publius Gallus, a Roman knight, was outlawed for having been intimate 
<A NAME="190"></A>with Faenius Rufus and somewhat acquainted with Vetus. To the freedman 
<A NAME="191"></A>who was the accuser, was given, as a reward for his service, a seat in 
<A NAME="192"></A>the theatre among the tribune's officers. The month too following April, 
<A NAME="193"></A>or Neroneus, was changed from Maius into the name of Claudius, and Junius 
<A NAME="194"></A>into that of Germanicus, Cornelius Orfitus, the proposer of the motion, 
<A NAME="195"></A>publicly declaring that the month Junius had been passed over because the 
<A NAME="196"></A>execution of the two Torquati for their crimes had now rendered its name 
<A NAME="197"></A>inauspicious.
<A NAME="198"></A><BR><BR>A year of shame and of so many evil deeds heaven also marked by 
<A NAME="199"></A>storms and pestilence. Campania was devastated by a hurricane, which destroyed 
<A NAME="200"></A>everywhere countryhouses, plantations and crops, and carried its fury to 
<A NAME="201"></A>the neighbourhood of Rome, where a terrible plague was sweeping away all 
<A NAME="202"></A>classes of human beings without any such derangement of the atmosphere 
<A NAME="203"></A>as to be visibly apparent. Yet the houses were filled with lifeless forms 
<A NAME="204"></A>and the streets with funerals. Neither age nor sex was exempt from peril. 
<A NAME="205"></A>Slaves and the free-born populace alike were suddenly cut off, amid the 
<A NAME="206"></A>wailings of wives and children, who were often consumed on the very funeral 
<A NAME="207"></A>pile of their friends by whom they had been sitting and shedding tears. 
<A NAME="208"></A>Knights and senators perished indiscriminately, and yet their deaths were 
<A NAME="209"></A>less deplored because they seemed to forestal the emperor's cruelty by 
<A NAME="210"></A>an ordinary death. That same year levies of troops were held in Narbon 
<A NAME="211"></A>Gaul, Africa and Asia, to fill up the legions of Illyricum, all soldiers 
<A NAME="212"></A>in which, worn out by age or ill-health, were receiving their discharge. 
<A NAME="213"></A>Lugdunum was consoled by the prince for a ruinous disaster by a gift of 
<A NAME="214"></A>four million sesterces, so that what was lost to the city might be replaced. 
<A NAME="215"></A>Its people had previously offered this same amount for the distresses of 
<A NAME="216"></A>Rome.
<A NAME="217"></A><BR><BR>In the consulship of Caius Suetonius and Lucius Telesinus, Antistius 
<A NAME="218"></A>Sosianus, who, as I have stated, had been punished with exile for repeated 
<A NAME="219"></A>satires on Nero, having heard that there was such honour for informers 
<A NAME="220"></A>and that the emperor was so partial to bloodshed, being himself too of 
<A NAME="221"></A>a restless temper and quick to seize opportunities, made a friend of a 
<A NAME="222"></A>man in like condition with himself, one Pammenes, an exile in the same 
<A NAME="223"></A>place, noted for his skill as an astrologer, and consequently bound to 
<A NAME="224"></A>many in close intimacy. He thought there must be a meaning in the frequent 
<A NAME="225"></A>messages and the consultations, and he learnt at the same time that an 
<A NAME="226"></A>annual payment was furnished him by Publius Anteius. He knew too that Anteius 
<A NAME="227"></A>was hated by Nero for his love of Agrippina, and that his wealth was sufficiently 
<A NAME="228"></A>conspicuous to provoke cupidity, and that this was the cause of the destruction 
<A NAME="229"></A>of many. Accordingly he intercepted a letter from Anteius, and having also 
<A NAME="230"></A>stolen some notes about the day of his nativity and his future career, 
<A NAME="231"></A>which were hidden away among Pammenes' secret papers, and having further 
<A NAME="232"></A>discovered some remarks on the birth and life of Ostorius Scapula, he wrote 
<A NAME="233"></A>to the emperor that he would communicate important news which would contribute 
<A NAME="234"></A>to his safety, if he could but obtain a brief reprieve of his exile. Anteius 
<A NAME="235"></A>and Ostorius were, he hinted, grasping at empire and prying into the destinies 
<A NAME="236"></A>of themselves and of the prince. Some swift galleys were then despatched 
<A NAME="237"></A>and Sosianus speedily arrived. On the disclosure of his information, Anteius 
<A NAME="238"></A>and Ostorius were classed with condemned criminals rather than with men 
<A NAME="239"></A>on their trial, so completely, indeed, that no one would attest the will 
<A NAME="240"></A>of Anteius, till Tigellinus interposed to sanction it. Anteius had been 
<A NAME="241"></A>previously advised by him not to delay this final document. Then he drank 
<A NAME="242"></A>poison, but disgusted at its slowness, he hastened death by severing his 
<A NAME="243"></A>veins.
<A NAME="244"></A><BR><BR>Ostorius was living at the time on a remote estate on the Ligurian 
<A NAME="245"></A>frontier. Thither a centurion was despatched to hurry on his destruction. 
<A NAME="246"></A>There was a motive for promptitude arising out of the fact that Ostorius, 
<A NAME="247"></A>with his great military fame and the civic crown he had won in Britain, 
<A NAME="248"></A>possessed, too, as he was of huge bodily strength and skill in arms, had 
<A NAME="249"></A>made Nero, who was always timid and now more frightened than ever by the 
<A NAME="250"></A>lately discovered conspiracy, fearful of a sudden attack. So the centurion, 
<A NAME="251"></A>having barred every exit from the house, disclosed the emperor's orders 
<A NAME="252"></A>to Ostorius. That fortitude which he had often shown in fighting the enemy 
<A NAME="253"></A>Ostorius now turned against himself. And as his veins, though severed, 
<A NAME="254"></A>allowed but a scanty flow of blood, he used the help of a slave, simply 
<A NAME="255"></A>to hold up a dagger firmly, and then pressing the man's hand towards him, 
<A NAME="256"></A>he met the point with his throat.
<A NAME="257"></A><BR><BR>Even if I had to relate foreign wars and deaths encountered in 
<A NAME="258"></A>the service of the State with such a monotony of disaster, I should myself 
<A NAME="259"></A>have been overcome by disgust, while I should look for weariness in my 
<A NAME="260"></A>readers, sickened as they would be by the melancholy and continuous destruction 
<A NAME="261"></A>of our citizens, however glorious to themselves. But now a servile submissiveness 
<A NAME="262"></A>and so much wanton bloodshed at home fatigue the mind and paralyze it with 
<A NAME="263"></A>grief. The only indulgence I would ask from those who will acquaint themselves 
<A NAME="264"></A>with these horrors is that I be not thought to hate men who perished so 
<A NAME="265"></A>tamely. Such was the wrath of heaven against the Roman State that one may 
<A NAME="266"></A>not pass over it with a single mention, as one might the defeat of armies 
<A NAME="267"></A>and the capture of cities. Let us grant this privilege to the posterity 
<A NAME="268"></A>of illustrious men, that just as in their funeral obsequies such men are 
<A NAME="269"></A>not confounded in a common burial, so in the record of their end they may 
<A NAME="270"></A>receive and retain a special memorial.
<A NAME="271"></A><BR><BR>Within a few days, in quick succession, Annaeus Mela, Cerialis 
<A NAME="272"></A>Anicius, Rufius Crispinus, and Petronius fell, Mela and Crispinus being 
<A NAME="273"></A>Roman knights with senatorian rank. The latter had once commanded the praetorians 
<A NAME="274"></A>and had been rewarded with the decorations of the consulate. He had lately 
<A NAME="275"></A>been banished to Sardinia on a charge of conspiracy, and on receiving a 
<A NAME="276"></A>message that he was doomed to die had destroyed himself. Mela, son of the 
<A NAME="277"></A>same parents as Gallio and Seneca, had refrained from seeking promotion 
<A NAME="278"></A>out of a perverse vanity which wished to raise a Roman knight to an equality 
<A NAME="279"></A>with ex-consuls. He also thought that there was a shorter road to the acquisition 
<A NAME="280"></A>of wealth through offices connected with the administration of the emperor's 
<A NAME="281"></A>private business. He had too in his son Annaeus Lucanus a powerful aid 
<A NAME="282"></A>in rising to distinction. After the death of Lucanus, he rigorously called 
<A NAME="283"></A>in the debts due to his estate, and thereby provoked an accuser in the 
<A NAME="284"></A>person of Fabius Romanus, one of the intimate friends of Lucanus. A story 
<A NAME="285"></A>was invented that the father and son shared between them a knowledge of 
<A NAME="286"></A>the conspiracy, and a letter was forged in Lucanus's name. This Nero examined, 
<A NAME="287"></A>and ordered it to be conveyed to Mela, whose wealth he ravenously desired. 
<A NAME="288"></A>Mela meanwhile, adopting the easiest mode of death then in fashion, opened 
<A NAME="289"></A>his veins, after adding a codicil to his will bequeathing an immense amount 
<A NAME="290"></A>to Tigellinus and his son-in-law, Cossutianus Capito, in order to save 
<A NAME="291"></A>the remainder. In this codicil he is also said to have written, by way 
<A NAME="292"></A>of remonstrance against the injustice of his death, that he died without 
<A NAME="293"></A>any cause for punishment, while Rufius Crispinus and Anicius Cerialis still 
<A NAME="294"></A>enjoyed life, though bitter foes to the prince. It was thought that he 
<A NAME="295"></A>had invented this about Crispinus, because the man had been already murdered; 
<A NAME="296"></A>about Cerialis, with the object of procuring his murder. Soon afterwards 
<A NAME="297"></A>Cerialis laid violent hands on himself, and received less pity than the 
<A NAME="298"></A>others, because men remembered that he had betrayed a conspiracy to Caius 
<A NAME="299"></A>Caesar.
<A NAME="300"></A><BR><BR>With regard to Caius Petronius, I ought to dwell a little on his 
<A NAME="301"></A>antecedents. His days he passed in sleep, his nights in the business and 
<A NAME="302"></A>pleasures of life. Indolence had raised him to fame, as energy raises others, 
<A NAME="303"></A>and he was reckoned not a debauchee and spendthrift, like most of those 
<A NAME="304"></A>who squander their substance, but a man of refined luxury. And indeed his 
<A NAME="305"></A>talk and his doings, the freer they were and the more show of carelessness 
<A NAME="306"></A>they exhibited, were the better liked, for their look of natural simplicity. 
<A NAME="307"></A>Yet as proconsul of Bithynia and soon afterwards as consul, he showed himself 
<A NAME="308"></A>a man of vigour and equal to business. Then falling back into vice or affecting 
<A NAME="309"></A>vice, he was chosen by Nero to be one of his few intimate associates, as 
<A NAME="310"></A>a critic in matters of taste, while the emperor thought nothing charming 
<A NAME="311"></A>or elegant in luxury unless Petronius had expressed to him his approval 
<A NAME="312"></A>of it. Hence jealousy on the part of Tigellinus, who looked on him as a 
<A NAME="313"></A>rival and even his superior in the science of pleasure. And so he worked 
<A NAME="314"></A>on the prince's cruelty, which dominated every other passion, charging 
<A NAME="315"></A>Petronius with having been the friend of Scaevinus, bribing a slave to 
<A NAME="316"></A>become informer, robbing him of the means of defence, and hurrying into 
<A NAME="317"></A>prison the greater part of his domestics.
<A NAME="318"></A><BR><BR>It happened at the time that the emperor was on his way Campania 
<A NAME="319"></A>and that Petronius, after going as far as Cumae, was there detained. He 
<A NAME="320"></A>bore no longer the suspense of fear or of hope. Yet he did not fling away 
<A NAME="321"></A>life with precipitate haste, but having made an incision in his veins and 
<A NAME="322"></A>then, according to his humour, bound them up, he again opened them, while 
<A NAME="323"></A>he conversed with his friends, not in a serious strain or on topics that 
<A NAME="324"></A>might win for him the glory of courage. And he listened to them as they 
<A NAME="325"></A>repeated, not thoughts on the immortality of the soul or on the theories 
<A NAME="326"></A>of philosophers, but light poetry and playful verses. To some of his slaves 
<A NAME="327"></A>he gave liberal presents, a flogging to others. He dined, indulged himself 
<A NAME="328"></A>in sleep, that death, though forced on him, might have a natural appearance. 
<A NAME="329"></A>Even in his will he did not, as did many in their last moments, flatter 
<A NAME="330"></A>Nero or Tigellinus or any other of the men in power. On the contrary, he 
<A NAME="331"></A>described fully the prince's shameful excesses, with the names of his male 
<A NAME="332"></A>and female companions and their novelties in debauchery, and sent the account 
<A NAME="333"></A>under seal to Nero. Then he broke his signet-ring, that it might not be 
<A NAME="334"></A>subsequently available for imperilling others.
<A NAME="335"></A><BR><BR>When Nero was in doubt how the ingenious varieties of his nightly 
<A NAME="336"></A>revels became notorious, Silia came into his mind, who, as a senator's 
<A NAME="337"></A>wife, was a conspicuous person, and who had been his chosen associate in 
<A NAME="338"></A>all his profligacy and was very intimate with Petronius. She was banished 
<A NAME="339"></A>for not having, as was suspected, kept secret what she had seen and endured, 
<A NAME="340"></A>a sacrifice to his personal resentment. Minucius Thermus, an ex-praetor, 
<A NAME="341"></A>he surrendered to the hate of Tigellinus, because a freedman of Thermus 
<A NAME="342"></A>had brought criminal charges against Tigellinus, such that the man had 
<A NAME="343"></A>to atone for them himself by the torture of the rack, his patron by an 
<A NAME="344"></A>undeserved death.
<A NAME="345"></A><BR><BR>Nero after having butchered so many illustrious men, at last aspired 
<A NAME="346"></A>to extirpate virtue itself by murdering Thrasea Paetus and Barea Soranus. 
<A NAME="347"></A>Both men he had hated of old, Thrasea on additional grounds, because he 
<A NAME="348"></A>had walked out of the Senate when Agrippina's case was under discussion, 
<A NAME="349"></A>as I have already related, and had not given the Juvenile games any conspicuous 
<A NAME="350"></A>encouragement. Nero's displeasure at this was the deeper, since this same 
<A NAME="351"></A>Thrasea had sung in a tragedian's dress at Patavium, his birth-place, in 
<A NAME="352"></A>some games instituted by the Trojan Antenor. On the day, too, on which 
<A NAME="353"></A>the praetor Antistius was being sentenced to death for libels on Nero, 
<A NAME="354"></A>Thrasea proposed and carried a more merciful decision. Again, when divine 
<A NAME="355"></A>honours were decreed to Poppaea, he was purposely absent and did not attend 
<A NAME="356"></A>her funeral. All this Capito Cossutianus would not allow to be forgotten. 
<A NAME="357"></A>He had a heart eager for the worst wickedness, and he also bore ill-will 
<A NAME="358"></A>to Thrasea, the weight of whose influence had crushed him, while envoys 
<A NAME="359"></A>from Cilicia, supported by Thrasea's advocacy, were accusing him of 
<A NAME="360"></A>extortion.
<A NAME="361"></A><BR><BR>He alleged, too, against him the following charges:- "Thrasea," 
<A NAME="362"></A>he said, "at the beginning of the year always avoided the usual oath of 
<A NAME="363"></A>allegiance; he was not present at the recital of the public prayers, though 
<A NAME="364"></A>he had been promoted to the priesthood of the Fifteen; he had never offered 
<A NAME="365"></A>a sacrifice for the safety of the prince or for his heavenly voice. Though 
<A NAME="366"></A>formerly he had been assiduous and unwearied in showing himself a supporter 
<A NAME="367"></A>or an opponent even of the most ordinary motions of senators, he had not 
<A NAME="368"></A>entered the Senate-house for three years, and very lately, when all were 
<A NAME="369"></A>rushing thither with rival eagerness to put down Silanus and Vetus, he 
<A NAME="370"></A>had attended by preference to the private business of his clients. This 
<A NAME="371"></A>was political schism, and, should many dare to do the like, it was actual 
<A NAME="372"></A>war."
<A NAME="373"></A><BR><BR>Capito further added, "The country in its eagerness for discord 
<A NAME="374"></A>is now talking of you, Nero, and of Thrasea, as it talked once of Caius 
<A NAME="375"></A>Caesar and Marcus Cato. Thrasea has his followers or rather his satellites, 
<A NAME="376"></A>who copy, not indeed as yet the audacious tone of his sentiments, but only 
<A NAME="377"></A>his manners and his looks, a sour and gloomy set, bent on making your mirthfulness 
<A NAME="378"></A>a reproach to you. He is the only man who cares not for your safety, honours 
<A NAME="379"></A>not your accomplishments. The prince's prosperity he despises. Can it be 
<A NAME="380"></A>that he is not satisfied with your sorrows and griefs? It shows the same 
<A NAME="381"></A>spirit not to believe in Poppaea's divinity as to refuse to swear obedience 
<A NAME="382"></A>to the acts of the Divine Augustus and the Divine Julius. He contemns religious 
<A NAME="383"></A>rites; he annuls laws. The daily records of the Roman people are read attentively 
<A NAME="384"></A>in the provinces and the armies that they may know what Thrasea has not 
<A NAME="385"></A>done.
<A NAME="386"></A><BR><BR>"Either let us go over to his system, if it is better than ours, 
<A NAME="387"></A>or let those who desire change have their leader and adviser taken from 
<A NAME="388"></A>them. That sect of his gave birth to the Tuberones and Favonii, names hateful 
<A NAME="389"></A>even to the old republic. They make a show of freedom, to overturn the 
<A NAME="390"></A>empire; should they destroy it, they will attack freedom itself. In vain 
<A NAME="391"></A>have you banished Cassius, if you are going to allow rivals of the Bruti 
<A NAME="392"></A>to multiply and flourish. Finally, write nothing yourself about Thrasea; 
<A NAME="393"></A>leave the Senate to decide for us." Nero further stimulated the eager wrath 
<A NAME="394"></A>of Cossutianus, and associated with him the pungent eloquence of Marcellus 
<A NAME="395"></A>Eprius.
<A NAME="396"></A><BR><BR>As for the impeachment of Barea Soranus, Ostorius Sabinus, a Roman 
<A NAME="397"></A>knight, had already claimed it for himself. It arose out of his proconsulate 
<A NAME="398"></A>of Asia, where he increased the prince's animosity by his uprightness and 
<A NAME="399"></A>diligence, as well as by having bestowed pains on opening the port of Ephesus 
<A NAME="400"></A>and passed over without punishment the violence of the citizens of Pergamos 
<A NAME="401"></A>in their efforts to hinder Acratus, one of the emperor's freedmen, from 
<A NAME="402"></A>carrying off statues and pictures. But the crime imputed to him was friendship 
<A NAME="403"></A>with Plautus and intrigues to lure the province into thoughts of revolt. 
<A NAME="404"></A>The time chosen for the fatal sentence was that at which Tiridates was 
<A NAME="405"></A>on his way to receive the sovereignty of Armenia, so that crime at home 
<A NAME="406"></A>might be partially veiled amid rumours on foreign affairs, or that Nero 
<A NAME="407"></A>might display his imperial grandeur by the murder of illustrious men, as 
<A NAME="408"></A>though it were a kingly exploit.
<A NAME="409"></A><BR><BR>Accordingly when all Rome rushed out to welcome the emperor and 
<A NAME="410"></A>see the king, Thrasea, though forbidden to appear, did not let his spirit 
<A NAME="411"></A>be cast down, but wrote a note to Nero, in which he demanded to know the 
<A NAME="412"></A>charges against him, and asserted that he would clear himself, if he were 
<A NAME="413"></A>informed of the crimes alleged and had an opportunity of refuting them. 
<A NAME="414"></A>This note Nero received with eagerness, in the hope that Thrasea in dismay 
<A NAME="415"></A>had written something to enhance the emperor's glory and to tarnish his 
<A NAME="416"></A>own honour. When it turned out otherwise, and he himself, on the contrary, 
<A NAME="417"></A>dreaded the glance and the defiant independence of the guiltless man, he 
<A NAME="418"></A>ordered the Senate to be summoned.
<A NAME="419"></A><BR><BR>Thrasea then consulted his most intimate friends whether he should 
<A NAME="420"></A>attempt or spurn defence. Conflicting advice was offered. Those who thought 
<A NAME="421"></A>it best for him to enter the Senate house said that they counted confidently 
<A NAME="422"></A>on his courage, and were sure that he would say nothing but what would 
<A NAME="423"></A>heighten his renown. "It was for the feeble and timid to invest their last 
<A NAME="424"></A>moments with secrecy. Let the people behold a man who could meet death. 
<A NAME="425"></A>Let the Senate hear words, almost of divine inspiration, more than human. 
<A NAME="426"></A>It was possible that the very miracle might impress even a Nero. But should 
<A NAME="427"></A>he persist in his cruelty, posterity would at least distinguish between 
<A NAME="428"></A>the memory of an honourable death and the cowardice of those who perished 
<A NAME="429"></A>in silence."
<A NAME="430"></A><BR><BR>Those, on the other hand, who thought that he ought to wait at 
<A NAME="431"></A>home, though their opinion of him was the same, hinted that mockeries and 
<A NAME="432"></A>insults were in store for him. "Spare your ears" they said, "taunts and 
<A NAME="433"></A>revilings. Not only are Cossutianus and Eprius eagerly bent on crime; there 
<A NAME="434"></A>are numbers more, daring enough, perchance, to raise the hand of violence 
<A NAME="435"></A>in their brutality. Even good men through fear do the like. Better save 
<A NAME="436"></A>the Senate which you have adorned to the last the infamy of such an outrage, 
<A NAME="437"></A>and leave it a matter of doubt what the senators would have decided, had 
<A NAME="438"></A>they seen Thrasea on his trial. It is with a vain hope we are aiming to 
<A NAME="439"></A>touch Nero with shame for his abominations, and we have far more cause 
<A NAME="440"></A>to fear that he will vent his fury on your wife, your household, on all 
<A NAME="441"></A>others dear to you. And therefore, while you are yet stainless and undisgraced, 
<A NAME="442"></A>seek to close life with the glory of those in whose track and pursuits 
<A NAME="443"></A>you have passed it."
<A NAME="444"></A><BR><BR>Present at this deliberation was Rusticus Arulenus, an enthusiastic 
<A NAME="445"></A>youth, who, in his ardour for renown, offered, as he was tribune of the 
<A NAME="446"></A>people, to protest against the sentence of the Senate. Thrasea checked 
<A NAME="447"></A>his impetuous temper, not wishing him to attempt what would be as futile, 
<A NAME="448"></A>and useless to the accused, as it would be fatal to the protester. "My 
<A NAME="449"></A>days," he said, "are ended, and I must not now abandon a scheme of life 
<A NAME="450"></A>in which for so many years I have persevered. You are at the beginning 
<A NAME="451"></A>of a career of office, and your future is yet clear. Weigh thoroughly with 
<A NAME="452"></A>yourself beforehand, at such a crisis as this, the path of political life 
<A NAME="453"></A>on which you enter." He then reserved for his own consideration the question 
<A NAME="454"></A>whether it became him to enter the Senate.
<A NAME="455"></A><BR><BR>Next day, however, two praetorian cohorts under arms occupied the 
<A NAME="456"></A>temple of Venus Genetrix. A group of ordinary citizens with swords which 
<A NAME="457"></A>they did not conceal, had blocked the approach to the Senate. Through the 
<A NAME="458"></A>squares and colonnades were scattered bodies of soldiers, amid whose looks 
<A NAME="459"></A>of menace the senators entered their house. A speech from the emperor was 
<A NAME="460"></A>read by his quaestor. Without addressing any one by name, he censured the 
<A NAME="461"></A>senators for neglecting their public duties, and drawing by their example 
<A NAME="462"></A>the Roman knights into idleness. "For what wonder is it," he asked, "that 
<A NAME="463"></A>men do not come from remote provinces when many, after obtaining the consulate 
<A NAME="464"></A>or some sacred office, give all their thoughts by choice to the beauty 
<A NAME="465"></A>of their gardens?" Here was, so to say, a weapon for the accusers, on which 
<A NAME="466"></A>they fastened.
<A NAME="467"></A><BR><BR>Cossutianus made a beginning, and then Marcellus in more violent 
<A NAME="468"></A>tones exclaimed that the whole commonwealth was at stake. "It is," he said, 
<A NAME="469"></A>"the stubbornness of inferiors which lessens the clemency of our ruler. 
<A NAME="470"></A>We senators have hitherto been too lenient in allowing him to be mocked 
<A NAME="471"></A>with impunity by Thrasea throwing off allegiance, by his son-in-law Helvidius 
<A NAME="472"></A>Priscus indulging similar frenzies, by Paconius Agrippinus, the inheritor 
<A NAME="473"></A>of his father's hatred towards emperors, and by Curtius Montanus, the habitual 
<A NAME="474"></A>composer of abominable verses. I miss the presence of an ex-consul in the 
<A NAME="475"></A>Senate, of a priest when we offer our vows, of a citizen when we swear 
<A NAME="476"></A>obedience, unless indeed, in defiance of the manners and rites of our ancestors, 
<A NAME="477"></A>Thrasea has openly assumed the part of a traitor and an enemy. In a word, 
<A NAME="478"></A>let the man, wont to act the senator and to screen those who disparage 
<A NAME="479"></A>the prince, come among us; let him propose any reform or change he may 
<A NAME="480"></A>desire. We shall more readily endure his censure of details than we can 
<A NAME="481"></A>now bear the silence by which he condemns everything. Is it the peace throughout 
<A NAME="482"></A>the world or victories won without loss to our armies which vex him? A 
<A NAME="483"></A>man who grieves at the country's prosperity, who treats our public places, 
<A NAME="484"></A>theatres and temples as if they were a desert, and who is ever threatening 
<A NAME="485"></A>us with exile, let us not enable such an one to gratify his perverse vanity. 
<A NAME="486"></A>To him the decrees of this house, the offices of State, the city of Rome 
<A NAME="487"></A>seem as nothing. Let him sever his life from a country all love for which 
<A NAME="488"></A>he has long lost and the very sight of which he has now put from 
<A NAME="489"></A>him."
<A NAME="490"></A><BR><BR>While Marcellus, with the savage and menacing look he usually wore, 
<A NAME="491"></A>spoke these and like words with rising fury in his voice, countenance, 
<A NAME="492"></A>and eye, that familiar grief to which a thick succession of perils had 
<A NAME="493"></A>habituated the Senate gave way to a new and profounder panic, as they saw 
<A NAME="494"></A>the soldiers' hands on their weapons. At the same moment the venerable 
<A NAME="495"></A>form of Thrasea rose before their imagination, and some there were who 
<A NAME="496"></A>pitied Helvidius too, doomed as he was to suffer for an innocent alliance. 
<A NAME="497"></A>"What again," they asked, "was the charge against Agrippinus except his 
<A NAME="498"></A>father's sad fate, since he too, though guiltless as his son, fell beneath 
<A NAME="499"></A>the cruelty of Tiberius? As for Montanus, a youth without a blemish, author 
<A NAME="500"></A>of no libellous poem, he was positively driven out an exile because he 
<A NAME="501"></A>had exhibited genius."
<A NAME="502"></A><BR><BR>And meanwhile Ostorius Sabinus, the accuser of Soranus, entered, 
<A NAME="503"></A>and began by speaking of his friendship with Rubellius Plautus and of his 
<A NAME="504"></A>proconsulate in Asia which he had, he said, adapted to his own glory rather 
<A NAME="505"></A>than to the public welfare, by fostering seditious movements in the various 
<A NAME="506"></A>states. These were bygones, but there was a fresh charge involving the 
<A NAME="507"></A>daughter in the peril of the father, to the effect that she had lavished 
<A NAME="508"></A>money on astrologers. This indeed had really occurred through the filial 
<A NAME="509"></A>affection of Servilia (that was the girl's name), who, out of love for 
<A NAME="510"></A>her father and the thoughtlessness of youth, had consulted them, only however 
<A NAME="511"></A>about the safety of her family, whether Nero could be appeased, and the 
<A NAME="512"></A>trial before the Senate have no dreadful result.
<A NAME="513"></A><BR><BR>She was accordingly summoned before the Senate, and there they 
<A NAME="514"></A>stood facing one another before the consuls' tribunal, the aged parent, 
<A NAME="515"></A>and opposite to him the daughter, in the twentieth year of her age, widowed 
<A NAME="516"></A>and forlorn, her husband Annius Pollio having lately been driven into banishment, 
<A NAME="517"></A>without so much as a glance at her father, whose peril she seemed to have 
<A NAME="518"></A>aggravated.
<A NAME="519"></A><BR><BR>Then on the accuser asking her whether she had sold her bridal 
<A NAME="520"></A>presents or stript her neck of its ornaments to raise money for the performance 
<A NAME="521"></A>of magical rites, she at first flung herself on the ground and wept long 
<A NAME="522"></A>in silence. After awhile, clasping the altar steps and altar, she exclaimed, 
<A NAME="523"></A>"I have invoked no impious deities, no enchantments, nor aught else in 
<A NAME="524"></A>my unhappy prayers, but only that thou, Caesar, and you, senators, might 
<A NAME="525"></A>preserve unharmed this best of fathers. My jewels, my apparel, and the 
<A NAME="526"></A>signs of my rank I gave up, as I would have given up my life-blood had 
<A NAME="527"></A>they demanded it. They must have seen this, those men before unknown to 
<A NAME="528"></A>me, both as to the name they bear and the arts they practise. No mention 
<A NAME="529"></A>was made by me of the emperor, except as one of the divinities. But my 
<A NAME="530"></A>most unhappy father knows nothing, and, if it is a crime, I alone am 
<A NAME="531"></A>guilty."
<A NAME="532"></A><BR><BR>While she was yet speaking, Soranus caught up her words, and exclaimed 
<A NAME="533"></A>that she had not gone with him into the province; that, from her youth, 
<A NAME="534"></A>she could not have been known to Plautus, and that she was not involved 
<A NAME="535"></A>in the charges against her husband. "Treat separately," he said, "the case 
<A NAME="536"></A>of one who is guilty only of an exaggerated filial piety, and as for myself, 
<A NAME="537"></A>let me undergo any fate." He was rushing, as he spoke, into the embraces 
<A NAME="538"></A>of his daughter who hurried towards him, but the lictors interposed and 
<A NAME="539"></A>stopped them both. Place was then given to the witnesses, and the appearance 
<A NAME="540"></A>among them of Publius Egnatius provoked as much indignation as the cruelty 
<A NAME="541"></A>of the prosecution had excited pity. A client of Soranus, and now hired 
<A NAME="542"></A>to ruin his friend, he professed the dignified character of a Stoic, and 
<A NAME="543"></A>had trained himself in demeanour and language to exhibit an ideal of virtue. 
<A NAME="544"></A>In his heart, however, treacherous and cunning, he concealed greed and 
<A NAME="545"></A>sensuality. As soon as money had brought these vices to light, he became 
<A NAME="546"></A>an example, warning us to beware just as much of those who under the guise 
<A NAME="547"></A>of virtuous tastes are false and deceitful in friendship, as of men wholly 
<A NAME="548"></A>entangled in falsehoods and stained with every infamy.
<A NAME="549"></A><BR><BR>That same day brought with it a noble pattern in Cassius Asclepiodotus, 
<A NAME="550"></A>whose vast wealth made him a foremost man in Bithynia. He had honoured 
<A NAME="551"></A>Soranus in his prosperity with a respect which he did not cast off in his 
<A NAME="552"></A>fall, and he was now stript of all his property and driven into exile; 
<A NAME="553"></A>so impartially indifferent is heaven to examples of virtue and vice. Thrasea, 
<A NAME="554"></A>Soranus, and Servilia were allowed the choice of death. Helvidius and Paconius 
<A NAME="555"></A>were banished from Italy. Montanus was spared to his father's intercessions 
<A NAME="556"></A>on the understanding that he was not to be admitted to political life. 
<A NAME="557"></A>The prosecutors, Eprius and Cossutianus, received each five million sesterces, 
<A NAME="558"></A>Ostorius twelve hundred thousand, with the decorations of the 
<A NAME="559"></A>quaestorship.
<A NAME="560"></A><BR><BR>Then, as evening approached, the consul's quaestor was sent to 
<A NAME="561"></A>Thrasea, who was passing his time in his garden. He had had a crowded gathering 
<A NAME="562"></A>of distinguished men and women, giving special attention to Demetrius, 
<A NAME="563"></A>a professor of the Cynic philosophy. With him, as might be inferred from 
<A NAME="564"></A>his earnest expression of face and from words heard when they raised their 
<A NAME="565"></A>voices, he was speculating on the nature of the soul and on the separation 
<A NAME="566"></A>of the spirit from the body, till Domitius Caecilianus, one of his intimate 
<A NAME="567"></A>friends, came to him and told him in detail what the Senate had decided. 
<A NAME="568"></A>When all who were present, wept and bitterly complained, Thrasea urged 
<A NAME="569"></A>them to hasten their departure and not mingle their own perils with the 
<A NAME="570"></A>fate of a doomed man. Arria, too, who aspired to follow her husband's end 
<A NAME="571"></A>and the example of Arria, her mother, he counselled to preserve her life, 
<A NAME="572"></A>and not rob the daughter of their love of her only stay.
<A NAME="573"></A><BR><BR>Then he went out into a colonnade, where he was found by the quaestor, 
<A NAME="574"></A>joyful rather than otherwise, as he had learnt that Helvidius, his son-in-law, 
<A NAME="575"></A>was merely excluded from Italy.
<A NAME="576"></A><BR><BR>When he heard the Senate's decision, he led Helvidius and Demetrius 
<A NAME="577"></A>into a chamber, and having laid bare the arteries of each arm, he let the 
<A NAME="578"></A>blood flow freely, and, as he sprinkled it on the ground, he called the 
<A NAME="579"></A>quaestor to his side and said, "We pour out a libation to Jupiter the Deliverer. 
<A NAME="580"></A>Behold, young man, and may the gods avert the omen, but you have been born 
<A NAME="581"></A>into times in which it is well to fortify the spirit with examples of courage." 
<A NAME="582"></A>Then as the slowness of his end brought with it grievous anguish, turning 
<A NAME="583"></A>his eyes on Demetrius
<A NAME="584"></A><BR><BR>[At this point the Annals are broken off. Much remained to be told 
<A NAME="585"></A>about the last two years of Nero's reign.]
