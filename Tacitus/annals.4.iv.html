<A NAME="start"></A>
<A NAME="10"></A>A.D. 23-28
<A NAME="11"></A><BR><BR>The year when Caius Asinius and Caius Antistius were consuls was 
<A NAME="12"></A>the ninth of Tiberius's reign, a period of tranquillity for the State and 
<A NAME="13"></A>prosperity for his own house, for he counted Germanicus's death a happy 
<A NAME="14"></A>incident. Suddenly fortune deranged everything; the emperor became a cruel 
<A NAME="15"></A>tyrant, as well as an abettor of cruelty in others. Of this the cause and 
<A NAME="16"></A>origin was Aelius Sejanus, commander of the praetorian cohorts, of whose 
<A NAME="17"></A>influence I have already spoken. I will now fully describe his extraction, 
<A NAME="18"></A>his character, and the daring wickedness by which he grasped at 
<A NAME="19"></A>power.
<A NAME="20"></A><BR><BR>Born at Vulsinii, the son of Seius Strabo, a Roman knight, he attached 
<A NAME="21"></A>himself in his early youth to Caius Caesar, grandson of the Divine Augustus, 
<A NAME="22"></A>and the story went that he had sold his person to Apicius, a rich debauchee. 
<A NAME="23"></A>Soon afterwards he won the heart of Tiberius so effectually by various 
<A NAME="24"></A>artifices that the emperor, ever dark and mysterious towards others, was 
<A NAME="25"></A>with Sejanus alone careless and freespoken. It was not through his craft, 
<A NAME="26"></A>for it was by this very weapon that he was overthrown; it was rather from 
<A NAME="27"></A>heaven's wrath against Rome, to whose welfare his elevation and his fall 
<A NAME="28"></A>were alike disastrous. He had a body which could endure hardships, and 
<A NAME="29"></A>a daring spirit. He was one who screened himself, while he was attacking 
<A NAME="30"></A>others; he was as cringing as he was imperious; before the world he affected 
<A NAME="31"></A>humility; in his heart he lusted after supremacy, for the sake of which 
<A NAME="32"></A>he sometimes lavish and luxurious, but oftener energetic and watchful, 
<A NAME="33"></A>qualities quite as mischievous when hypocritically assumed for the attainment 
<A NAME="34"></A>of sovereignty.
<A NAME="35"></A><BR><BR>He strengthened the hitherto moderate powers of his office by concentrating 
<A NAME="36"></A>the cohorts scattered throughout the capital into one camp, so that they 
<A NAME="37"></A>might all receive orders at the same moment, and that the sight of their 
<A NAME="38"></A>numbers and strength might give confidence to themselves, while it would 
<A NAME="39"></A>strike terror into the citizens. His pretexts were the demoralisation incident 
<A NAME="40"></A>to a dispersed soldiery, the greater effectiveness of simultaneous action 
<A NAME="41"></A>in the event of a sudden peril, and the stricter discipline which would 
<A NAME="42"></A>be insured by the establishment of an encampment at a distance from the 
<A NAME="43"></A>temptations of the city. As soon as the camp was completed, he crept gradually 
<A NAME="44"></A>into the affections of the soldiers by mixing with them and addressing 
<A NAME="45"></A>them by name, himself selecting the centurions and tribunes. With the Senate 
<A NAME="46"></A>too he sought to ingratiate himself, distinguishing his partisans with 
<A NAME="47"></A>offices and provinces, Tiberius readily yielding, and being so biassed 
<A NAME="48"></A>that not only in private conversation but before the senators and the people 
<A NAME="49"></A>he spoke highly of him as the partner of his toils, and allowed his statues 
<A NAME="50"></A>to be honoured in theatres, in forums, and at the head-quarters of our 
<A NAME="51"></A>legions.
<A NAME="52"></A><BR><BR>There were however obstacles to his ambition in the imperial house 
<A NAME="53"></A>with its many princes, a son in youthful manhood and grown-up grandsons. 
<A NAME="54"></A>As it would be unsafe to sweep off such a number at once by violence, while 
<A NAME="55"></A>craft would necessitate successive intervals in crime, he chose, on the 
<A NAME="56"></A>whole, the stealthier way and to begin with Drusus, against whom he had 
<A NAME="57"></A>the stimulus of a recent resentment. Drusus, who could not brook a rival 
<A NAME="58"></A>and was somewhat irascible, had, in a casual dispute, raised his fist at 
<A NAME="59"></A>Sejanus, and, when he defended himself, had struck him in the face. On 
<A NAME="60"></A>considering every plan Sejanus thought his easiest revenge was to turn 
<A NAME="61"></A>his attention to Livia, Drusus's wife. She was a sister of Germanicus, 
<A NAME="62"></A>and though she was not handsome as a girl, she became a woman of surpassing 
<A NAME="63"></A>beauty. Pretending an ardent passion for her, he seduced her, and having 
<A NAME="64"></A>won his first infamous triumph, and assured that a woman after having parted 
<A NAME="65"></A>with her virtue will hesitate at nothing, he lured her on to thoughts of 
<A NAME="66"></A>marriage, of a share in sovereignty, and of her husband's destruction. 
<A NAME="67"></A>And she, the niece of Augustus, the daughter-in-law of Tiberius, the mother 
<A NAME="68"></A>of children by Drusus, for a provincial paramour, foully disgraced herself, 
<A NAME="69"></A>her ancestors, and her descendants, giving up honour and a sure position 
<A NAME="70"></A>for prospects as base as they were uncertain. They took into their confidence 
<A NAME="71"></A>Eudemus, Livia's friend and physician, whose profession was a pretext for 
<A NAME="72"></A>frequent secret interviews. Sejanus, to avert his mistress's jealousy, 
<A NAME="73"></A>divorced his wife Apicata, by whom he had had three children. Still the 
<A NAME="74"></A>magnitude of the crime caused fear and delay, and sometimes a conflict 
<A NAME="75"></A>of plans.
<A NAME="76"></A><BR><BR>Meanwhile, at the beginning of this year, Drusus, one of the children 
<A NAME="77"></A>of Germanicus, assumed the dress of manhood, with a repetition of the honours 
<A NAME="78"></A>decreed by the Senate to his brother Nero. The emperor added a speech with 
<A NAME="79"></A>warm praise of his son for sharing a father's affection to his brother's 
<A NAME="80"></A>children. Drusus indeed, difficult as it is for power and mutual harmony 
<A NAME="81"></A>to exist side by side, had the character of being kindly disposed or at 
<A NAME="82"></A>least not unfriendly towards the lads. And now the old plan, so often insincerely 
<A NAME="83"></A>broached, of a progress through the provinces, was again discussed. The 
<A NAME="84"></A>emperor's pretext was the number of veterans on the eve of discharge and 
<A NAME="85"></A>the necessity of fresh levies for the army. Volunteers were not forthcoming, 
<A NAME="86"></A>and even if they were sufficiently numerous, they had not the same bravery 
<A NAME="87"></A>and discipline, as it is chiefly the needy and the homeless who adopt by 
<A NAME="88"></A>their own choice a soldier's life. Tiberius also rapidly enumerated the 
<A NAME="89"></A>legions and the provinces which they had to garrison. I too ought, I think, 
<A NAME="90"></A>to go through these details, and thus show what forces Rome then had under 
<A NAME="91"></A>arms, what kings were our allies, and how much narrower then were the limits 
<A NAME="92"></A>of our empire.
<A NAME="93"></A><BR><BR>Italy on both seas was guarded by fleets, at Misenum and at Ravenna, 
<A NAME="94"></A>and the contiguous coast of Gaul by ships of war captured in the victory 
<A NAME="95"></A>of Actium, and sent by Augustus powerfully manned to the town of Forojulium. 
<A NAME="96"></A>But chief strength was on the Rhine, as a defence alike against Germans 
<A NAME="97"></A>and Gauls, and numbered eight legions. Spain, lately subjugated, was held 
<A NAME="98"></A>by three. Mauretania was king Juba's, who had received it as a gift from 
<A NAME="99"></A>the Roman people. The rest of Africa was garrisoned by two legions, and 
<A NAME="100"></A>Egypt by the same number. Next, beginning with Syria, all within the entire 
<A NAME="101"></A>tract of country stretching as far as the Euphrates, was kept in restraint 
<A NAME="102"></A>by four legions, and on this frontier were Iberian, Albanian, and other 
<A NAME="103"></A>kings, to whom our greatness was a protection against any foreign power. 
<A NAME="104"></A>Thrace was held by Rhoemetalces and the children of Cotys; the bank of 
<A NAME="105"></A>the Danube by two legions in Pannonia, two in Moesia, and two also were 
<A NAME="106"></A>stationed in Dalmatia, which, from the situation of the country, were in 
<A NAME="107"></A>the rear of the other four, and, should Italy suddenly require aid, not 
<A NAME="108"></A>to distant to be summoned. But the capital was garrisoned by its own special 
<A NAME="109"></A>soldiery, three city, nine praetorian cohorts, levied for the most part 
<A NAME="110"></A>in Etruria and Umbria, or ancient Latium and the old Roman colonies. There 
<A NAME="111"></A>were besides, in commanding positions in the provinces, allied fleets, 
<A NAME="112"></A>cavalry and light infantry, of but little inferior strength. But any detailed 
<A NAME="113"></A>account of them would be misleading, since they moved from place to place 
<A NAME="114"></A>as circumstances required, and had their numbers increased and sometimes 
<A NAME="115"></A>diminished.
<A NAME="116"></A><BR><BR>It is however, I think, a convenient opportunity for me to review 
<A NAME="117"></A>the hitherto prevailing methods of administration in the other departments 
<A NAME="118"></A>of the State, inasmuch as that year brought with it the beginning of a 
<A NAME="119"></A>change for the worse in Tiberius's policy. In the first place, public business 
<A NAME="120"></A>and the most important private matters were managed by the Senate: the 
<A NAME="121"></A>leading men were allowed freedom of discussion, and when they stooped to 
<A NAME="122"></A>flattery, the emperor himself checked them. He bestowed honours with regard 
<A NAME="123"></A>to noble ancestry, military renown, or brilliant accomplishments as a civilian, 
<A NAME="124"></A>letting it be clearly seen that there were no better men to choose. The 
<A NAME="125"></A>consul and the praetor retained their prestige; inferior magistrates exercised 
<A NAME="126"></A>their authority; the laws too, with the single exception of cases of treason, 
<A NAME="127"></A>were properly enforced.
<A NAME="128"></A><BR><BR>As to the duties on corn, the indirect taxes and other branches 
<A NAME="129"></A>of the public revenue, they were in the hands of companies of Roman knights. 
<A NAME="130"></A>The emperor intrusted his own property to men of the most tried integrity 
<A NAME="131"></A>or to persons known only by their general reputation, and once appointed 
<A NAME="132"></A>they were retained without any limitation, so that most of them grew old 
<A NAME="133"></A>in the same employments. The city populace indeed suffered much from high 
<A NAME="134"></A>prices, but this was no fault of the emperor, who actually endeavoured 
<A NAME="135"></A>to counteract barren soils and stormy seas with every resource of wealth 
<A NAME="136"></A>and foresight. And he was also careful not to distress the provinces by 
<A NAME="137"></A>new burdens, and to see that in bearing the old they were safe from any 
<A NAME="138"></A>rapacity or oppression on the part of governors. Corporal punishments and 
<A NAME="139"></A>confiscations of property were unknown.
<A NAME="140"></A><BR><BR>The emperor had only a few estates in Italy, slaves on a moderate 
<A NAME="141"></A>scale, and his household was confined to a few freedmen. If ever he had 
<A NAME="142"></A>a dispute with a private person, it was decided in the law courts. All 
<A NAME="143"></A>this, not indeed with any graciousness, but in a blunt fashion which often 
<A NAME="144"></A>alarmed, he still kept up, until the death of Drusus changed everything. 
<A NAME="145"></A>While he lived, the system continued, because Sejanus, as yet only in the 
<A NAME="146"></A>beginning of his power, wished to be known as an upright counsellor, and 
<A NAME="147"></A>there was one whose vengeance he dreaded, who did not conceal his hatred 
<A NAME="148"></A>and incessantly complained "that a stranger was invited to assist in the 
<A NAME="149"></A>government while the emperor's son was alive. How near was the step of 
<A NAME="150"></A>declaring the stranger a colleague! Ambition at first had a steep path 
<A NAME="151"></A>before it; when once the way had been entered, zealous adherents were forthcoming. 
<A NAME="152"></A>Already, at the pleasure of the commander of the guards, a camp had been 
<A NAME="153"></A>established; the soldiers given into his hands; his statues were to be 
<A NAME="154"></A>seen among the monuments of Cneius Pompeius; his grandsons would be of 
<A NAME="155"></A>the same blood as the family of the Drusi. Henceforth they must pray that 
<A NAME="156"></A>he might have self-control, and so be contented." So would Drusus talk, 
<A NAME="157"></A>not unfrequently, or only in the hearing of a few persons. Even his confidences, 
<A NAME="158"></A>now that his wife had been corrupted, were betrayed.
<A NAME="159"></A><BR><BR>Sejanus accordingly thought that he must be prompt, and chose a 
<A NAME="160"></A>poison the gradual working of which might be mistaken for a natural disorder. 
<A NAME="161"></A>It was given to Drusus by Lygdus, a eunuch, as was ascertained eight years 
<A NAME="162"></A>later. As for Tiberius, he went to the Senate house during the whole time 
<A NAME="163"></A>of the prince's illness, either because he was not afraid, or to show his 
<A NAME="164"></A>strength of mind, and even in the interval between his death and funeral. 
<A NAME="165"></A>Seeing the consuls, in token of their grief, sitting on the ordinary benches, 
<A NAME="166"></A>he reminded them of their high office and of their proper place; and when 
<A NAME="167"></A>the Senate burst into tears, suppressing a groan, he revived their spirits 
<A NAME="168"></A>with a fluent speech. "He knew indeed that he might be reproached for thus 
<A NAME="169"></A>encountering the gaze of the Senate after so recent an affliction. Most 
<A NAME="170"></A>mourners could hardly bear even the soothing words of kinsfolk or to look 
<A NAME="171"></A>on the light of day. And such were not to be condemned as weak. But he 
<A NAME="172"></A>had sought a more manly consolation in the bosom of the 
<A NAME="173"></A>commonwealth."
<A NAME="174"></A><BR><BR>Then deploring the extreme age of Augusta, the childhood of his 
<A NAME="175"></A>grandsons, and his own declining years, he begged the Senate to summon 
<A NAME="176"></A>Germanicus's children, the only comfort under their present misery. The 
<A NAME="177"></A>consuls went out, and having encouraged the young princes with kind words, 
<A NAME="178"></A>brought them in and presented them to the emperor. Taking them by the hand 
<A NAME="179"></A>he said: "Senators, when these boys lost their father, I committed them 
<A NAME="180"></A>to their uncle, and begged him, though he had children of his own, to cherish 
<A NAME="181"></A>and rear them as his own offspring, and train them for himself and for 
<A NAME="182"></A>posterity. Drusus is now lost to us, and I turn my prayers to you, and 
<A NAME="183"></A>before heaven and your country I adjure you to receive into your care and 
<A NAME="184"></A>guidance the great-grandsons of Augustus, descendants of a most noble ancestry. 
<A NAME="185"></A>So fulfil your duty and mine. To you, Nero and Drusus, these senators are 
<A NAME="186"></A>as fathers. Such is your birth that your prosperity and adversity must 
<A NAME="187"></A>alike affect the State."
<A NAME="188"></A><BR><BR>There was great weeping at these words, and then many a benediction. 
<A NAME="189"></A>Had the emperor set bounds to his speech, he must have filled the hearts 
<A NAME="190"></A>of his hearers with sympathy and admiration. But he now fell back on those 
<A NAME="191"></A>idle and often ridiculed professions about restoring the republic, and 
<A NAME="192"></A>the wish that the consuls or some one else might undertake the government, 
<A NAME="193"></A>and thus destroyed belief even in what was genuine and 
<A NAME="194"></A>noble.
<A NAME="195"></A><BR><BR>The same honours were decreed to the memory of Drusus as to that 
<A NAME="196"></A>of Germanicus, and many more were added. Such is the way with flattery, 
<A NAME="197"></A>when repeated. The funeral with its procession of statues was singularly 
<A NAME="198"></A>grand. Aeneas, the father of the Julian house, all the Alban kings, Romulus, 
<A NAME="199"></A>Rome's founder, then the Sabine nobility, Attus Clausus, and the busts 
<A NAME="200"></A>of all the other Claudii were displayed in a long train.
<A NAME="201"></A><BR><BR>In relating the death of Drusus I have followed the narrative of 
<A NAME="202"></A>most of the best historians. But I would not pass over a rumour of the 
<A NAME="203"></A>time, the strength of which is not even yet exhausted. Sejanus, it is said, 
<A NAME="204"></A>having seduced Livia into crime, next secured, by the foulest means, the 
<A NAME="205"></A>consent of Lygdus, the eunuch, as from his youth and beauty he was his 
<A NAME="206"></A>master's favourite, and one of his principal attendants. When those who 
<A NAME="207"></A>were in the secret had decided on the time and place of the poisoning, 
<A NAME="208"></A>Sejanus, with the most consummate daring, reversed his plan, and, whispering 
<A NAME="209"></A>an accusation against Drusus of intending to poison his father, warned 
<A NAME="210"></A>Tiberius to avoid the first draught offered him as he was dining at his 
<A NAME="211"></A>son's house. Thus deceived, the old emperor, on sitting down to the banquet, 
<A NAME="212"></A>took the cup and handed it to Drusus. His suspicions were increased when 
<A NAME="213"></A>Drusus, in perfect unconsciousness, drank it off with youthful eagerness, 
<A NAME="214"></A>apparently, out of fear and shame, bringing on himself the death which 
<A NAME="215"></A>he had plotted against his father.
<A NAME="216"></A><BR><BR>These popular rumours, over and above the fact that they are not 
<A NAME="217"></A>vouched for by any good writer, may be instantly refuted. For who, with 
<A NAME="218"></A>moderate prudence, far less Tiberius with his great experience, would have 
<A NAME="219"></A>thrust destruction on a son, without even hearing him, with his own hand 
<A NAME="220"></A>too, and with an impossibility of returning to better thoughts. Surely 
<A NAME="221"></A>he would rather have had the slave who handed the poison, tortured, have 
<A NAME="222"></A>sought to discover the traitor, in short, would have been as hesitating 
<A NAME="223"></A>and tardy in the case of an only son hitherto unconvicted of any crime, 
<A NAME="224"></A>as he was naturally even with strangers. But as Sejanus had the credit 
<A NAME="225"></A>of contriving every sort of wickedness, the fact that he was the emperor's 
<A NAME="226"></A>special favourite, and that both were hated by the rest of the world, procured 
<A NAME="227"></A>belief for any monstrous fiction, and rumour too always has a dreadful 
<A NAME="228"></A>side in regard to the deaths of men in power. Besides, the whole process 
<A NAME="229"></A>of the crime was betrayed by Apicata, Sejanus's wife, and fully divulged, 
<A NAME="230"></A>under torture, by Eudemus and Lygdus. No writer has been found sufficiently 
<A NAME="231"></A>malignant to fix the guilt on Tiberius, though every circumstance was scrutinized 
<A NAME="232"></A>and exaggerated. My object in mentioning and refuting this story is, by 
<A NAME="233"></A>a conspicuous example, to put down hearsay, and to request all into whose 
<A NAME="234"></A>hands my work shall come, not to catch eagerly at wild and improbable rumours 
<A NAME="235"></A>in preference to genuine history which has not been perverted into 
<A NAME="236"></A>romance.
<A NAME="237"></A><BR><BR>Tiberius pronounced a panegyric on his son before the Rostra, during 
<A NAME="238"></A>which the Senate and people, in appearance rather than in heart, put on 
<A NAME="239"></A>the expression and accents of sorrow, while they inwardly rejoiced at the 
<A NAME="240"></A>brightening future of the family of Germanicus. This beginning of popularity 
<A NAME="241"></A>and the ill-concealed ambition of their mother Agrippina, hastened its 
<A NAME="242"></A>downfall. Sejanus when he saw that the death of Drusus was not avenged 
<A NAME="243"></A>on the murderers and was no grief to the people, grew bold in wickedness, 
<A NAME="244"></A>and, now that his first attempt had succeeded, speculated on the possibility 
<A NAME="245"></A>of destroying the children of Germanicus, whose succession to the throne 
<A NAME="246"></A>was a certainty. There were three, and poison could not be distributed 
<A NAME="247"></A>among them, because of the singular fidelity of their guardians and the 
<A NAME="248"></A>unassailable virtue of Agrippina. So Sejanus inveighed against Agrippina's 
<A NAME="249"></A>arrogance, and worked powerfully on Augusta's old hatred of her and on 
<A NAME="250"></A>Livia's consciousness of recent guilt, and urged both these women to represent 
<A NAME="251"></A>to the emperor that her pride as a mother and her reliance on popular enthusiasm 
<A NAME="252"></A>were leading her to dream of empire. Livia availed herself of the cunning 
<A NAME="253"></A>of accusers, among whom she had selected Julius Postumus, a man well suited 
<A NAME="254"></A>to her purpose, as he had an intrigue with Mutilia Prisca, and was consequently 
<A NAME="255"></A>in the confidence of Augusta, over whose mind Prisca had great influence. 
<A NAME="256"></A>She thus made her aged grandmother, whose nature it was to tremble for 
<A NAME="257"></A>her power, irreconcilably hostile to her grandson's widow. Agrippina's 
<A NAME="258"></A>friends too were induced to be always inciting her proud spirit by mischievous 
<A NAME="259"></A>talk.
<A NAME="260"></A><BR><BR>Tiberius meanwhile, who did not relax his attention to business, 
<A NAME="261"></A>and found solace in his work, occupied himself with the causes of citizens 
<A NAME="262"></A>at Rome and with petitions from allies. Decrees of the Senate were passed 
<A NAME="263"></A>at his proposal for relieving the cities of Cibyra and Aegium in Asia and 
<A NAME="264"></A>Achaia, which had suffered from earthquakes, by a remission of three years' 
<A NAME="265"></A>tribute. Vibius Serenus too, proconsul of Further Spain, was condemned 
<A NAME="266"></A>for violence in his official capacity, and was banished to the island of 
<A NAME="267"></A>Amorgus for his savage temper. Carsidius Sacerdos, accused of having helped 
<A NAME="268"></A>our enemy Tacfarinas with supplies of grain, was acquitted, as was also 
<A NAME="269"></A>Caius Gracchus on the same charge. Gracchus's father, Sempronius, had taken 
<A NAME="270"></A>him when a mere child to the island of Cercina to be his companion in exile. 
<A NAME="271"></A>There he grew up among outcasts who knew nothing of a liberal education, 
<A NAME="272"></A>and after a while supported himself in Africa and Sicily by petty trade. 
<A NAME="273"></A>But he did not escape the dangers of high rank. Had not his innocence been 
<A NAME="274"></A>protected by Aelius Lamia and Lucius Apronius, successive governors of 
<A NAME="275"></A>Africa, the splendid fame of that ill-starred family and the downfall of 
<A NAME="276"></A>his father would have dragged him to ruin.
<A NAME="277"></A><BR><BR>This year too brought embassies from the Greek communities. The 
<A NAME="278"></A>people of Samos and Cos petitioned for the confirmation of the ancient 
<A NAME="279"></A>right of sanctuary for the respective temples of Juno and Aesculapius. 
<A NAME="280"></A>The Samians relied on a decree of the Amphictyonic Council, which had the 
<A NAME="281"></A>supreme decision of all questions when the Greeks, through the cities they 
<A NAME="282"></A>had founded in Asia, had possession of the sea-coast. Cos could boast equal 
<A NAME="283"></A>antiquity, and it had an additional claim connected with the place. Roman 
<A NAME="284"></A>citizens had been admitted to the temple of Aesculapius, when king Mithridates 
<A NAME="285"></A>ordered a general massacre of them throughout all the islands and cities 
<A NAME="286"></A>of Asia.
<A NAME="287"></A><BR><BR>Next, after various and usually fruitless complaints from the praetors, 
<A NAME="288"></A>the emperor finally brought forward a motion about the licentious behaviour 
<A NAME="289"></A>of the players. "They had often," he said, "sought to disturb the public 
<A NAME="290"></A>peace, and to bring disgrace on private families, and the old Oscan farce, 
<A NAME="291"></A>once a wretched amusement for the vulgar, had become at once so indecent 
<A NAME="292"></A>and so popular, that it must be checked by the Senate's authority. The 
<A NAME="293"></A>players, upon this, were banished from Italy.
<A NAME="294"></A><BR><BR>That same year also brought fresh sorrow to the emperor by being 
<A NAME="295"></A>fatal to one of the twin sons of Drusus, equally too by the death of an 
<A NAME="296"></A>intimate friend. This was Lucilius Longus, the partner of all his griefs 
<A NAME="297"></A>and joys, the only senator who had been the companion of his retirement 
<A NAME="298"></A>in Rhodes. And so, though he was a man of humble origin, the Senate decreed 
<A NAME="299"></A>him a censor's funeral and a statue in the forum of Augustus at the public 
<A NAME="300"></A>expense. Everything indeed was as yet in the hands of the Senate, and consequently 
<A NAME="301"></A>Lucilius Capito, procurator of Asia, who was impeached by his province, 
<A NAME="302"></A>was tried by them, the emperor vehemently asserting "that he had merely 
<A NAME="303"></A>given the man authority over the slaves and property of the imperial establishments; 
<A NAME="304"></A>that if he had taken upon himself the powers of a praetor and used military 
<A NAME="305"></A>force, he had disregarded his instructions; therefore they must hear the 
<A NAME="306"></A>provincials." So the case was heard and the accused condemned. The cities 
<A NAME="307"></A>of Asia, gratified by this retribution and the punishment inflicted in 
<A NAME="308"></A>the previous year on Caius Silanus, voted a temple to Tiberius, his mother, 
<A NAME="309"></A>and the Senate, and were permitted to build it. Nero thanked the Senators 
<A NAME="310"></A>and his grandfather on their behalf and carried with him the joyful sympathies 
<A NAME="311"></A>of his audience, who, with the memory of Germanicus fresh in their minds, 
<A NAME="312"></A>imagined that it was his face they saw, his voice they heard. The youth 
<A NAME="313"></A>too had a modesty and a grace of person worthy of a prince, the more charming 
<A NAME="314"></A>because of his peril from the notorious enmity of Sejanus.
<A NAME="315"></A><BR><BR>About the same time the emperor spoke on the subject of electing 
<A NAME="316"></A>a priest of Jupiter in the room of Servius Maluginensis, deceased, and 
<A NAME="317"></A>of the enactment of a new law. "It was," he said, "the old custom to nominate 
<A NAME="318"></A>together three patricians, sons of parents wedded according to the primitive 
<A NAME="319"></A>ceremony, and of these one was to be chosen. Now however there was not 
<A NAME="320"></A>the same choice as formerly, the primitive form of marriage having been 
<A NAME="321"></A>given up or being observed only by a few persons." For this he assigned 
<A NAME="322"></A>several reasons, the chief being men's and women's indifference; then, 
<A NAME="323"></A>again, the ceremony itself had its difficulties, which were purposely avoided; 
<A NAME="324"></A>and there was the objection that the man who obtained this priesthood was 
<A NAME="325"></A>emancipated from the father's authority, as also was his wife, as passing 
<A NAME="326"></A>into the husband's control. So the Senate, Tiberius argued, ought to apply 
<A NAME="327"></A>some remedy by a decree of a law, as Augustus had accommodated certain 
<A NAME="328"></A>relics of a rude antiquity to the modern spirit.
<A NAME="329"></A><BR><BR>It was then decided, after a discussion of religious questions, 
<A NAME="330"></A>that the institution of the priests of Jupiter should remain unchanged. 
<A NAME="331"></A>A law however was passed that the priestess, in regard to her sacred functions, 
<A NAME="332"></A>was to be under the husband's control, but in other respects to retain 
<A NAME="333"></A>the ordinary legal position of women. Maluginensis, the son, was chosen 
<A NAME="334"></A>successor to his father. To raise the dignity of the priesthood and to 
<A NAME="335"></A>inspire the priests with more zeal in attending to the ceremonial, a gift 
<A NAME="336"></A>of two million sesterces was decreed to the Vestal Cornelia, chosen in 
<A NAME="337"></A>the room of Scantia; and, whenever Augusta entered the theatre, she was 
<A NAME="338"></A>to have a place in the seats of the Vestals.
<A NAME="339"></A><BR><BR>In the consulship of Cornelius Cethegus and Visellius Varro, the 
<A NAME="340"></A>pontiffs, whose example was followed by the other priests in offering prayers 
<A NAME="341"></A>for the emperor's health, commended also Nero and Drusus to the same deities, 
<A NAME="342"></A>not so much out of love for the young princes as out of sycophancy, the 
<A NAME="343"></A>absence and excess of which in a corrupt age are alike dangerous. Tiberius 
<A NAME="344"></A>indeed, who was never friendly to the house of Germanicus, was then vexed 
<A NAME="345"></A>beyond endurance at their youth being honoured equally with his declining 
<A NAME="346"></A>years. He summoned the pontiffs, and asked them whether it was to the entreaties 
<A NAME="347"></A>or the threats of Agrippina that they had made this concession. And though 
<A NAME="348"></A>they gave a flat denial, he rebuked them but gently, for many of them were 
<A NAME="349"></A>her own relatives or were leading men in the State. However he addressed 
<A NAME="350"></A>a warning to the Senate against encouraging pride in their young and excitable 
<A NAME="351"></A>minds by premature honours. For Sejanus spoke vehemently, and charged them 
<A NAME="352"></A>with rending the State almost by civil war. "There were those," he said, 
<A NAME="353"></A>"who called themselves the party of Agrippina, and, unless they were checked, 
<A NAME="354"></A>there would be more; the only remedy for the increasing discord was the 
<A NAME="355"></A>overthrow of one or two of the most enterprising leaders."
<A NAME="356"></A><BR><BR>Accordingly he attacked Caius Silius and Titius Sabinus. The friendship 
<A NAME="357"></A>of Germanicus was fatal to both. As for Silius, his having commanded a 
<A NAME="358"></A>great army for seven years, and won in Germany the distinctions of a triumph 
<A NAME="359"></A>for his success in the war with Sacrovir, would make his downfall all the 
<A NAME="360"></A>more tremendous and so spread greater terror among others. Many thought 
<A NAME="361"></A>that he had provoked further displeasure by his own presumption and his 
<A NAME="362"></A>extravagant boasts that his troops had been steadfastly loyal, while other 
<A NAME="363"></A>armies were falling into mutiny, and that Tiberius's throne could not have 
<A NAME="364"></A>lasted had his legions too been bent on revolution. All this the emperor 
<A NAME="365"></A>regarded as undermining his own power, which seemed to be unequal to the 
<A NAME="366"></A>burden of such an obligation. For benefits received are a delight to us 
<A NAME="367"></A>as long as we think we can requite them; when that possibility is far exceeded, 
<A NAME="368"></A>they are repaid with hatred instead of gratitude.
<A NAME="369"></A><BR><BR>Silius had a wife, Sosia Galla, whose love of Agrippina made her 
<A NAME="370"></A>hateful to the emperor. The two, it was decided, were to be attacked, but 
<A NAME="371"></A>Sabinus was to be put off for a time. Varro, the consul, was let loose 
<A NAME="372"></A>on them, who, under colour of a hereditary feud, humoured the malignity 
<A NAME="373"></A>of Sejanus to his own disgrace. The accused begged a brief respite, until 
<A NAME="374"></A>the prosecutor's consulship expired, but the emperor opposed the request. 
<A NAME="375"></A>"It was usual," he argued, "for magistrates to bring a private citizen 
<A NAME="376"></A>to trial, and a consul's authority ought not to be impaired, seeing that 
<A NAME="377"></A>it rested with his vigilance to guard the commonwealth from loss." It was 
<A NAME="378"></A>characteristic of Tiberius to veil new devices in wickedness under ancient 
<A NAME="379"></A>names. And so, with a solemn appeal, he summoned the Senate, as if there 
<A NAME="380"></A>were any laws by which Silius was being tried, as if Varro were a real 
<A NAME="381"></A>consul, or Rome a commonwealth. The accused either said nothing, or, if 
<A NAME="382"></A>he attempted to defend himself, hinted, not obscurely, at the person whose 
<A NAME="383"></A>resentment was crushing him. A long concealed complicity in Sacrovir's 
<A NAME="384"></A>rebellion, a rapacity which sullied his victory, and his wife Sosia's conduct, 
<A NAME="385"></A>were alleged against him. Unquestionably, they could not extricate themselves 
<A NAME="386"></A>from the charge of extortion. The whole affair however was conducted as 
<A NAME="387"></A>a trial for treason, and Silius forestalled impending doom by a self-inflicted 
<A NAME="388"></A>death.
<A NAME="389"></A><BR><BR>Yet there was a merciless confiscation of his property, though 
<A NAME="390"></A>not to refund their money to the provincials, none of whom pressed any 
<A NAME="391"></A>demand. But Augustus's bounty was wrested from him, and the claims of the 
<A NAME="392"></A>imperial exchequer were computed in detail. This was the first instance 
<A NAME="393"></A>on Tiberius's part of sharp dealing with the wealth of others. Sosia was 
<A NAME="394"></A>banished on the motion of Asinius Gallus, who had proposed that half her 
<A NAME="395"></A>estate should be confiscated, half left to the children. Marcus Lepidus, 
<A NAME="396"></A>on the contrary, was for giving a fourth to the prosecutors, as the law 
<A NAME="397"></A>required, and the remainder to the children.
<A NAME="398"></A><BR><BR>This Lepidus, I am satisfied, was for that age a wise and high-principled 
<A NAME="399"></A>man. Many a cruel suggestion made by the flattery of others he changed 
<A NAME="400"></A>for the better, and yet he did not want tact, seeing that he always enjoyed 
<A NAME="401"></A>an uniform prestige, and also the favour of Tiberius. This compels me to 
<A NAME="402"></A>doubt whether the liking of princes for some men and their antipathy to 
<A NAME="403"></A>others depend, like other contingencies, on a fate and destiny to which 
<A NAME="404"></A>we are born, or, to some degree, on our own plans; so that it is possible 
<A NAME="405"></A>to pursue a course between a defiant independence and a debasing servility, 
<A NAME="406"></A>free from ambition and its perils. Messalinus Cotta, of equally illustrious 
<A NAME="407"></A>ancestry as Lepidus, but wholly different in disposition, proposed that 
<A NAME="408"></A>the Senate should pass a decree providing that even innocent governors 
<A NAME="409"></A>who knew nothing of the delinquencies of others should be punished for 
<A NAME="410"></A>their wives' offences in the provinces as much as for their 
<A NAME="411"></A>own.
<A NAME="412"></A><BR><BR>Proceedings were then taken against Calpurnius Piso, a high-spirited 
<A NAME="413"></A>nobleman. He it was, as I have related, who had exclaimed more than once 
<A NAME="414"></A>in the Senate that he would quit Rome because of the combinations of the 
<A NAME="415"></A>informers, and had dared in defiance of Augusta's power, to sue Urgulania 
<A NAME="416"></A>and summon her from the emperor's palace. Tiberius submitted to this at 
<A NAME="417"></A>the time not ungraciously, but the remembrance of it was vividly impressed 
<A NAME="418"></A>on a mind which brooded over its resentments, even though the first impulse 
<A NAME="419"></A>of his displeasure had subsided.
<A NAME="420"></A><BR><BR>Quintus Granius accused Piso of secret treasonable conversation, 
<A NAME="421"></A>and added that he kept poison in his house and wore a dagger whenever he 
<A NAME="422"></A>came into the Senate. This was passed over as too atrocious to be true. 
<A NAME="423"></A>He was to be tried on the other charges, a multitude of which were heaped 
<A NAME="424"></A>on him, but his timely death cut short the trial.
<A NAME="425"></A><BR><BR>Next was taken the case of Cassius Severus' an exile. A man of 
<A NAME="426"></A>mean origin and a life of crime, but a powerful pleader, he had brought 
<A NAME="427"></A>on himself, by his persistent quarrelsomeness, a decision of the Senate, 
<A NAME="428"></A>under oath, which banished him to Crete. There by the same practices he 
<A NAME="429"></A>drew on himself, fresh odium and revived the old; stripped of his property 
<A NAME="430"></A>and outlawed, he wore out his old age on the rock of 
<A NAME="431"></A>Seriphos.
<A NAME="432"></A><BR><BR>About the same time Plautius Silvanus, the praetor, for unknown 
<A NAME="433"></A>reasons, threw his wife Apronia out of a window. When summoned before the 
<A NAME="434"></A>emperor by Lucius Apronius, his father-in-law, he replied incoherently, 
<A NAME="435"></A>representing that he was in a sound sleep and consequently knew nothing, 
<A NAME="436"></A>and that his wife had chosen to destroy herself. Without a moment's delay 
<A NAME="437"></A>Tiberius went to the house and inspected the chamber, where were seen the 
<A NAME="438"></A>marks of her struggling and of her forcible ejection. He reported this 
<A NAME="439"></A>to the Senate, and as soon as judges had been appointed, Urgulania, the 
<A NAME="440"></A>grandmother of Silvanus, sent her grandson a dagger. This was thought equivalent 
<A NAME="441"></A>to a hint from the emperor, because of the known intimacy between Augusta 
<A NAME="442"></A>and Urgulania. The accused tried the steel in vain, and then allowed his 
<A NAME="443"></A>veins to be opened. Shortly afterwards Numantina, his former wife, was 
<A NAME="444"></A>charged with having caused her husband's insanity by magical incantations 
<A NAME="445"></A>and potions, but she was acquitted.
<A NAME="446"></A><BR><BR>This year at last released Rome from her long contest with the 
<A NAME="447"></A>Numidian Tacfarinas. Former generals, when they thought that their successes 
<A NAME="448"></A>were enough to insure them triumphal distinctions, left the enemy to himself. 
<A NAME="449"></A>There were now in Rome three laurelled statues, and yet Tacfarinas was 
<A NAME="450"></A>still ravaging Africa, strengthened by reinforcements from the Moors, who, 
<A NAME="451"></A>under the boyish and careless rule of Ptolemaeus, Juba's son, had chosen 
<A NAME="452"></A>war in preference to the despotism of freedmen and slaves. He had the king 
<A NAME="453"></A>of the Garamantes to receive his plunder and to be the partner of his raids, 
<A NAME="454"></A>not indeed with a regular army, but with detachments of light troops whose 
<A NAME="455"></A>strength, as they came from a distance, rumour exaggerated. From the province 
<A NAME="456"></A>itself every needy and restless adventurer hurried to join him, for the 
<A NAME="457"></A>emperor, as if not an enemy remained in Africa after the achievements of 
<A NAME="458"></A>Blaesus, had ordered the ninth legion home, and Publius Dolabella, proconsul 
<A NAME="459"></A>that year, had not dared to retain it, because he feared the sovereign's 
<A NAME="460"></A>orders more than the risks of war.
<A NAME="461"></A><BR><BR>Tacfarinas accordingly spread rumours; that elsewhere also nations 
<A NAME="462"></A>were rending the empire of Rome and that therefore her soldiers were gradually 
<A NAME="463"></A>retiring from Africa, and that the rest might be cut off by a strong effort 
<A NAME="464"></A>on the part of all who loved freedom more than slavery. He thus augmented 
<A NAME="465"></A>his force, and having formed a camp, he besieged the town of Thubuscum. 
<A NAME="466"></A>Dolabella meanwhile collecting all the troops on the spot, raised the siege 
<A NAME="467"></A>at his first approach, by the terror of the Roman name and because the 
<A NAME="468"></A>Numidians cannot stand against the charge of infantry. He then fortified 
<A NAME="469"></A>suitable positions, and at the same time beheaded some chiefs of the Musulamii, 
<A NAME="470"></A>who were on the verge of rebellion. Next, as several expeditions against 
<A NAME="471"></A>Tacfarinas had proved the uselessness of following up the enemy's desultory 
<A NAME="472"></A>movements with the attack of heavy troops from a single point, he summoned 
<A NAME="473"></A>to his aid king Ptolemaeus and his people, and equipped four columns, under 
<A NAME="474"></A>the command of his lieutenants and tribunes. Marauding parties were also 
<A NAME="475"></A>led by picked Moors, Dolabella in person directing every 
<A NAME="476"></A>operation.
<A NAME="477"></A><BR><BR>Soon afterwards news came that the Numidians had fixed their tents 
<A NAME="478"></A>and encamped near a half-demolished fortress, by name Auzea, to which they 
<A NAME="479"></A>had themselves formerly set fire, and on the position of which they relied, 
<A NAME="480"></A>as it was inclosed by vast forests. Immediately the light infantry and 
<A NAME="481"></A>cavalry, without knowing whither they were being led, were hurried along 
<A NAME="482"></A>at quick march. Day dawned, and with the sound of trumpets and fierce shouts, 
<A NAME="483"></A>they were on the half-asleep barbarians, whose horses were tethered or 
<A NAME="484"></A>roaming over distant pastures. On the Roman side, the infantry was in close 
<A NAME="485"></A>array, the cavalry in its squadrons, everything prepared for an engagement, 
<A NAME="486"></A>while the enemy, utterly surprised, without arms, order, or plan, were 
<A NAME="487"></A>seized, slaughtered, or captured like cattle. The infuriated soldiers, 
<A NAME="488"></A>remembering their hardships and how often the longed-for conflict had been 
<A NAME="489"></A>eluded, sated themselves to a man with vengeance and bloodshed. The word 
<A NAME="490"></A>went through the companies that all were to aim at securing Tacfarinas, 
<A NAME="491"></A>whom, after so many battles, they knew well, as there would be no rest 
<A NAME="492"></A>from war except by the destruction of the enemy's leader. Tacfarinas, his 
<A NAME="493"></A>guards slain round him, his son a prisoner, and the Romans bursting on 
<A NAME="494"></A>him from every side, rushed on the darts, and by a death which was not 
<A NAME="495"></A>unavenged, escaped captivity.
<A NAME="496"></A><BR><BR>This ended the war. Dolabella asked for triumphal distinctions, 
<A NAME="497"></A>but was refused by Tiberius, out of compliment to Sejanus, the glory of 
<A NAME="498"></A>whose uncle Blaesus he did not wish to be forgotten. But this did not make 
<A NAME="499"></A>Blaesus more famous, while the refusal of the honour heightened Dolabella's 
<A NAME="500"></A>renown. He had, in fact, with a smaller army, brought back with him illustrious 
<A NAME="501"></A>prisoners and the fame of having slain the enemy's leader and terminated 
<A NAME="502"></A>the war. In his train were envoys from the Garamantes, a rare spectacle 
<A NAME="503"></A>in Rome. The nation, in its terror at the destruction of Tacfarinas, and 
<A NAME="504"></A>innocent of any guilty intention, had sent them to crave pardon of the 
<A NAME="505"></A>Roman people. And now that this war had proved the zealous loyalty of Ptolemaeus, 
<A NAME="506"></A>a custom of antiquity was revived, and one of the Senators was sent to 
<A NAME="507"></A>present him with an ivory sceptre and an embroidered robe, gifts anciently 
<A NAME="508"></A>bestowed by the Senate, and to confer on him the titles of king, ally, 
<A NAME="509"></A>and friend.
<A NAME="510"></A><BR><BR>The same summer, the germs of a slave war in Italy were crushed 
<A NAME="511"></A>by a fortunate accident. The originator of the movement was Titus Curtisius, 
<A NAME="512"></A>once a soldier of the praetorian guard. First, by secret meetings at Brundisium 
<A NAME="513"></A>and the neighbouring towns, then by placards publicly exhibited, he incited 
<A NAME="514"></A>the rural and savage slave-population of the remote forests to assert their 
<A NAME="515"></A>freedom. By divine providence, three vessels came to land for the use of 
<A NAME="516"></A>those who traversed that sea. In the same part of the country too was Curtius 
<A NAME="517"></A>Lupus, the quaestor, who, according to ancient precedent, had had the charge 
<A NAME="518"></A>of the "woodland pastures" assigned to him. Putting in motion a force of 
<A NAME="519"></A>marines, he broke up the seditious combination in its very first beginnings. 
<A NAME="520"></A>The emperor at once sent Staius, a tribune, with a strong detachment, by 
<A NAME="521"></A>whom the ringleader himself, with his most daring followers, were brought 
<A NAME="522"></A>prisoners to Rome where men already trembled at the vast scale of the slave-establishments, 
<A NAME="523"></A>in which there was an immense growth, while the freeborn populace daily 
<A NAME="524"></A>decreased.
<A NAME="525"></A><BR><BR>That same consulship witnessed a horrible instance of misery and 
<A NAME="526"></A>brutality. A father as defendant, a son as prosecutor, (Vibius Serenus 
<A NAME="527"></A>was the name of both) were brought before the Senate; the father, dragged 
<A NAME="528"></A>from exile in filth and squalor now stood in irons, while the son pleaded 
<A NAME="529"></A>for his guilt. With studious elegance of dress and cheerful looks, the 
<A NAME="530"></A>youth, at once accuser and witness, alleged a plot against the emperor 
<A NAME="531"></A>and that men had been sent to Gaul to excite rebellion, further adding 
<A NAME="532"></A>that Caecilius Cornutus, an ex-praetor, had furnished money. Cornutus, 
<A NAME="533"></A>weary of anxiety and feeling that peril was equivalent to ruin, hastened 
<A NAME="534"></A>to destroy himself. But the accused with fearless spirit, looked his son 
<A NAME="535"></A>in the face, shook his chains, and appealed to the vengeance of the gods, 
<A NAME="536"></A>with a prayer that they would restore him to his exile, where he might 
<A NAME="537"></A>live far away from such practices, and that, as for his son, punishment 
<A NAME="538"></A>might sooner or later overtake him. He protested too that Cornutus was 
<A NAME="539"></A>innocent and that his terror was groundless, as would easily be perceived, 
<A NAME="540"></A>if other names were given up; for he never would have plotted the emperor's 
<A NAME="541"></A>murder and a revolution with only one confederate.
<A NAME="542"></A><BR><BR>Upon this the prosecutor named Cneius Lentulus and Seius Tubero, 
<A NAME="543"></A>to the great confusion of the emperor, at finding a hostile rebellion and 
<A NAME="544"></A>disturbance of the public peace charged on two leading men in the state, 
<A NAME="545"></A>his own intimate friends, the first of whom was in extreme old age and 
<A NAME="546"></A>the second in very feeble health. They were, however, at once acquitted. 
<A NAME="547"></A>As for the father, his slaves were examined by torture, and the result 
<A NAME="548"></A>was unfavourable to the accuser. The man, maddened by remorse, and terror-stricken 
<A NAME="549"></A>by the popular voice, which menaced him with the dungeon, the rock, or 
<A NAME="550"></A>a parricide's doom, fled from Rome. He was dragged back from Ravenna, and 
<A NAME="551"></A>forced to go through the prosecution, during which Tiberius did not disguise 
<A NAME="552"></A>the old grudge he bore the exile Serenus. For after Libo's conviction, 
<A NAME="553"></A>Serenus had sent the emperor a letter, upbraiding him for not having rewarded 
<A NAME="554"></A>his special zeal in that trial, with further hints more insolent than could 
<A NAME="555"></A>be safely trusted to the easily offended ears of a despot. All this Tiberius 
<A NAME="556"></A>revived eight years later, charging on him various misconduct during that 
<A NAME="557"></A>interval, even though the examination by torture, owing to the obstinacy 
<A NAME="558"></A>of the slaves, had contradicted his guilt.
<A NAME="559"></A><BR><BR>The Senate then gave their votes that Serenus should be punished 
<A NAME="560"></A>according to ancient precedent, when the emperor, to soften the odium of 
<A NAME="561"></A>the affair, interposed with his veto. Next, Gallus Asinius proposed that 
<A NAME="562"></A>he should be confined in Gyaros or Donusa, but this he rejected, on the 
<A NAME="563"></A>ground that both these islands were deficient in water, and that he whose 
<A NAME="564"></A>life was spared, ought to be allowed the necessaries of life. And so Serenus 
<A NAME="565"></A>was conveyed back to Amorgus.
<A NAME="566"></A><BR><BR>In consequence of the suicide of Cornutus, it was proposed to deprive 
<A NAME="567"></A>informers of their rewards whenever a person accused of treason put an 
<A NAME="568"></A>end to his life by his own act before the completion of the trial. The 
<A NAME="569"></A>motion was on the point of being carried when the emperor, with a harshness 
<A NAME="570"></A>contrary to his manner, spoke openly for the informers, complaining that 
<A NAME="571"></A>the laws would be ineffective, and the State brought to the verge of ruin. 
<A NAME="572"></A>"Better," he said, "to subvert the constitution than to remove its guardians." 
<A NAME="573"></A>Thus the informers, a class invented to destroy the commonwealth, and never 
<A NAME="574"></A>enough controlled even by legal penalties, were stimulated by 
<A NAME="575"></A>rewards.
<A NAME="576"></A><BR><BR>Some little joy broke this long succession of horrors. Caius Cominius, 
<A NAME="577"></A>a Roman knight, was spared by the emperor, against whom he was convicted 
<A NAME="578"></A>of having written libellous verses, at the intercession of his brother, 
<A NAME="579"></A>who was a Senator. Hence it seemed the more amazing that one who knew better 
<A NAME="580"></A>things and the glory which waits on mercy, should prefer harsher courses. 
<A NAME="581"></A>He did not indeed err from dulness, and it is easy to see when the acts 
<A NAME="582"></A>of a sovereign meet with genuine, and when with fictitious popularity. 
<A NAME="583"></A>And even he himself, though usually artificial in manner, and though his 
<A NAME="584"></A>words escaped him with a seeming struggle, spoke out freely and fluently 
<A NAME="585"></A>whenever he came to a man's rescue.
<A NAME="586"></A><BR><BR>In another case, that of Publius Suillius, formerly quaestor to 
<A NAME="587"></A>Germanicus, who was to be expelled from Italy on a conviction of having 
<A NAME="588"></A>received money for a judicial decision, he held that the man ought to be 
<A NAME="589"></A>banished to an island, and so intensely strong was his feeling that he 
<A NAME="590"></A>bound the Senate by an oath that this was a State necessity. The act was 
<A NAME="591"></A>thought cruel at the moment, but subsequently it redounded to his honour 
<A NAME="592"></A>when Suillius returned from exile. The next age saw him in tremendous power 
<A NAME="593"></A>and a venal creature of the emperor Claudius, whose friendship he long 
<A NAME="594"></A>used, with success, never for good.
<A NAME="595"></A><BR><BR>The same punishment was adjudged to Catus Firmius, a Senator, for 
<A NAME="596"></A>having (it was alleged) assailed his sister with a false charge of treason. 
<A NAME="597"></A>Catus, as I have related, had drawn Libo into a snare and then destroyed 
<A NAME="598"></A>him by an information. Tiberius remembering this service, while he alleged 
<A NAME="599"></A>other reasons, deprecated a sentence of exile, but did not oppose his expulsion 
<A NAME="600"></A>from the Senate.
<A NAME="601"></A><BR><BR>Much what I have related and shall have to relate, may perhaps, 
<A NAME="602"></A>I am aware, seem petty trifles to record. But no one must compare my annals 
<A NAME="603"></A>with the writings of those who have described Rome in old days. They told 
<A NAME="604"></A>of great wars, of the storming of cities, of the defeat and capture of 
<A NAME="605"></A>kings, or whenever they turned by preference to home affairs, they related, 
<A NAME="606"></A>with a free scope for digression, the strifes of consuls with tribunes, 
<A NAME="607"></A>land and corn-laws, and the struggles between the commons and the aristocracy. 
<A NAME="608"></A>My labours are circumscribed and inglorious; peace wholly unbroken or but 
<A NAME="609"></A>slightly disturbed, dismal misery in the capital, an emperor careless about 
<A NAME="610"></A>the enlargement of the empire, such is my theme. Still it will not be useless 
<A NAME="611"></A>to study those at first sight trifling events out of which the movements 
<A NAME="612"></A>of vast changes often take their rise.
<A NAME="613"></A><BR><BR>All nations and cities are ruled by the people, the nobility, or 
<A NAME="614"></A>by one man. A constitution, formed by selection out of these elements, 
<A NAME="615"></A>it is easy to commend but not to produce; or, if it is produced, it cannot 
<A NAME="616"></A>be lasting. Formerly, when the people had power or when the patricians 
<A NAME="617"></A>were in the ascendant, the popular temper and the methods of controlling 
<A NAME="618"></A>it, had to be studied, and those who knew most accurately the spirit of 
<A NAME="619"></A>the Senate and aristocracy, had the credit of understanding the age and 
<A NAME="620"></A>of being wise men. So now, after a revolution, when Rome is nothing but 
<A NAME="621"></A>the realm of a single despot, there must be good in carefully noting and 
<A NAME="622"></A>recording this period, for it is but few who have the foresight to distinguish 
<A NAME="623"></A>right from wrong or what is sound from what is hurtful, while most men 
<A NAME="624"></A>learn wisdom from the fortunes of others. Still, though this is instructive, 
<A NAME="625"></A>it gives very little pleasure. Descriptions of countries, the various incidents 
<A NAME="626"></A>of battles, glorious deaths of great generals, enchain and refresh a reader's 
<A NAME="627"></A>mind. I have to present in succession the merciless biddings of a tyrant, 
<A NAME="628"></A>incessant prosecutions, faithless friendships, the ruin of innocence, the 
<A NAME="629"></A>same causes issuing in the same results, and I am everywhere confronted 
<A NAME="630"></A>by a wearisome monotony in my subject matter. Then, again, an ancient historian 
<A NAME="631"></A>has but few disparagers, and no one cares whether you praise more heartily 
<A NAME="632"></A>the armies of Carthage or Rome. But of many who endured punishment or disgrace 
<A NAME="633"></A>under Tiberius, the descendants yet survive; or even though the families 
<A NAME="634"></A>themselves may be now extinct, you will find those who, from a resemblance 
<A NAME="635"></A>of character, imagine that the evil deeds of others are a reproach to themselves. 
<A NAME="636"></A>Again, even honour and virtue make enemies, condemning, as they do, their 
<A NAME="637"></A>opposites by too close a contrast. But I return to my 
<A NAME="638"></A>work.
<A NAME="639"></A><BR><BR>In the year of the consulship of Cornelius Cossus and Asinius Agrippa, 
<A NAME="640"></A>Cremutius Cordus was arraigned on a new charge, now for the first time 
<A NAME="641"></A>heard. He had published a history in which he had praised Marcus Brutus 
<A NAME="642"></A>and called Caius Cassius the last of the Romans. His accusers were Satrius 
<A NAME="643"></A>Secundus and Pinarius Natta, creatures of Sejanus. This was enough to ruin 
<A NAME="644"></A>the accused; and then too the emperor listened with an angry frown to his 
<A NAME="645"></A>defence, which Cremutius, resolved to give up his life, began 
<A NAME="646"></A>thus:-
<A NAME="647"></A><BR><BR>"It is my words, Senators, which are condemned, so innocent am 
<A NAME="648"></A>I of any guilty act; yet these do not touch the emperor or the emperor's 
<A NAME="649"></A>mother, who are alone comprehended under the law of treason. I am said 
<A NAME="650"></A>to have praised Brutus and Cassius, whose careers many have described and 
<A NAME="651"></A>no one mentioned without eulogy. Titus Livius, pre-eminently famous for 
<A NAME="652"></A>eloquence and truthfulness, extolled Cneius Pompeius in such a panegyric 
<A NAME="653"></A>that Augustus called him Pompeianus, and yet this was no obstacle to their 
<A NAME="654"></A>friendship. Scipio, Afranius, this very Cassius, this same Brutus, he nowhere 
<A NAME="655"></A>describes as brigands and traitors, terms now applied to them, but repeatedly 
<A NAME="656"></A>as illustrious men. Asinius Pollio's writings too hand down a glorious 
<A NAME="657"></A>memory of them, and Messala Corvinus used to speak with pride of Cassius 
<A NAME="658"></A>as his general. Yet both these men prospered to the end with wealth and 
<A NAME="659"></A>preferment. Again, that book of Marcus Cicero, in which he lauded Cato 
<A NAME="660"></A>to the skies, how else was it answered by Caesar the dictator, than by 
<A NAME="661"></A>a written oration in reply, as if he was pleading in court? The letters 
<A NAME="662"></A>Antonius, the harangues of Brutus contain reproaches against Augustus, 
<A NAME="663"></A>false indeed, but urged with powerful sarcasm; the poems which we read 
<A NAME="664"></A>of Bibaculus and Catullus are crammed with invectives on the Caesars. Yet 
<A NAME="665"></A>the Divine Julius, the Divine Augustus themselves bore all this and let 
<A NAME="666"></A>it pass, whether in forbearance or in wisdom I cannot easily say. Assuredly 
<A NAME="667"></A>what is despised is soon forgotten; when you resent a thing, you seem to 
<A NAME="668"></A>recognise it."
<A NAME="669"></A><BR><BR>"Of the Greeks I say nothing; with them not only liberty, but even 
<A NAME="670"></A>license went unpunished, or if a person aimed at chastising, he retaliated 
<A NAME="671"></A>on satire by satire. It has, however, always been perfectly open to us 
<A NAME="672"></A>without any one to censure, to speak freely of those whom death has withdrawn 
<A NAME="673"></A>alike from the partialities of hatred or esteem. Are Cassius and Brutus 
<A NAME="674"></A>now in arms on the fields of Philippi, and am I with them rousing the people 
<A NAME="675"></A>by harangues to stir up civil war? Did they not fall more than seventy 
<A NAME="676"></A>years ago, and as they are known to us by statues which even the conqueror 
<A NAME="677"></A>did not destroy, so too is not some portion of their memory preserved for 
<A NAME="678"></A>us by historians? To every man posterity gives his due honour, and, if 
<A NAME="679"></A>a fatal sentence hangs over me, there will be those who will remember me 
<A NAME="680"></A>as well as Cassius and Brutus."
<A NAME="681"></A><BR><BR>He then left the Senate and ended his life by starvation. His books, 
<A NAME="682"></A>so the Senators decreed, were to be burnt by the aediles; but some copies 
<A NAME="683"></A>were left which were concealed and afterwards published. And so one is 
<A NAME="684"></A>all the more inclined to laugh at the stupidity of men who suppose that 
<A NAME="685"></A>the despotism of the present can actually efface the remembrances of the 
<A NAME="686"></A>next generation. On the contrary, the persecution of genius fosters its 
<A NAME="687"></A>influence; foreign tyrants, and all who have imitated their oppression, 
<A NAME="688"></A>have merely procured infamy for themselves and glory for their 
<A NAME="689"></A>victims.
<A NAME="690"></A><BR><BR>That year was such a continuous succession of prosecutions that 
<A NAME="691"></A>on the days of the Latin festival when Drusus, as city-prefect, had ascended 
<A NAME="692"></A>his tribunal for the inauguration of his office, Calpurnius Salvianus appeared 
<A NAME="693"></A>before him against Sextus Marius. This the emperor openly censured, and 
<A NAME="694"></A>it caused the banishment of Salvianus. Next, the people of Cyzicus were 
<A NAME="695"></A>accused of publicly neglecting the established worship of the Divine Augustus, 
<A NAME="696"></A>and also of acts of violence to Roman citizens. They were deprived of the 
<A NAME="697"></A>franchise which they had earned during the war with Mithridates, when their 
<A NAME="698"></A>city was besieged, and when they repulsed the king as much by their own 
<A NAME="699"></A>bravery as by the aid of Lucullus. Then followed the acquittal of Fonteius 
<A NAME="700"></A>Capito, the late proconsul of Asia, on proof that charges brought against 
<A NAME="701"></A>him by Vibius Serenus were fictitious. Still this did not injure Serenus, 
<A NAME="702"></A>to whom public hatred was actually a protection. Indeed any conspicuously 
<A NAME="703"></A>restless informer was, so to say, inviolable; only the insignificant and 
<A NAME="704"></A>undistinguished were punished.
<A NAME="705"></A><BR><BR>About the same time Further Spain sent a deputation to the Senate, 
<A NAME="706"></A>with a request to be allowed, after the example of Asia, to erect a temple 
<A NAME="707"></A>to Tiberius and his mother. On this occasion, the emperor, who had generally 
<A NAME="708"></A>a strong contempt for honours, and now thought it right to reply to the 
<A NAME="709"></A>rumour which reproached him with having yielded to vanity, delivered the 
<A NAME="710"></A>following speech:-
<A NAME="711"></A><BR><BR>"I am aware, Senators, that many deplore my want of firmness in 
<A NAME="712"></A>not having opposed a similar recent petition from the cities of Asia. I 
<A NAME="713"></A>will therefore both explain the grounds of my previous silence and my intentions 
<A NAME="714"></A>for the future. Inasmuch as the Divine Augustus did not forbid the founding 
<A NAME="715"></A>of a temple at Pergamos to himself and to the city of Rome, I who respect 
<A NAME="716"></A>as law all his actions and sayings, have the more readily followed a precedent 
<A NAME="717"></A>once approved, seeing that with the worship of myself was linked an expression 
<A NAME="718"></A>of reverence towards the Senate. But though it may be pardonable to have 
<A NAME="719"></A>allowed this once, it would be a vain and arrogant thing to receive the 
<A NAME="720"></A>sacred honour of images representing the divine throughout all the provinces, 
<A NAME="721"></A>and the homage paid to Augustus will disappear if it is vulgarised by indiscriminate 
<A NAME="722"></A>flattery.
<A NAME="723"></A><BR><BR>"For myself, Senators, I am mortal and limited to the functions 
<A NAME="724"></A>of humanity, content if I can adequately fill the highest place; of this 
<A NAME="725"></A>I solemnly assure you, and would have posterity remember it. They will 
<A NAME="726"></A>more than sufficiently honour my memory by believing me to have been worthy 
<A NAME="727"></A>of my ancestry, watchful over your interests, courageous in danger, fearless 
<A NAME="728"></A>of enmity, when the State required it. These sentiments of your hearts 
<A NAME="729"></A>are my temples, these my most glorious and abiding monuments. Those built 
<A NAME="730"></A>of stone are despised as mere tombs, if the judgment of posterity passes 
<A NAME="731"></A>into hatred. And therefore this is my prayer to our allies, our citizens, 
<A NAME="732"></A>and to heaven itself; to the last, that, to my life's close, it grant me 
<A NAME="733"></A>a tranquil mind, which can discern alike human and divine claims; to the 
<A NAME="734"></A>first, that, when I die, they honour my career and the reputation of my 
<A NAME="735"></A>name with praise and kindly remembrance."
<A NAME="736"></A><BR><BR>Henceforth Tiberius even in private conversations persisted in 
<A NAME="737"></A>showing contempt for such homage to himself. Some attributed this to modesty; 
<A NAME="738"></A>many to self-distrust; a few to a mean spirit. "The noblest men," it was 
<A NAME="739"></A>said, "have the loftiest aspirations, and so Hercules and Bacchus among 
<A NAME="740"></A>the Greeks and Quirinus among us were enrolled in the number of the gods. 
<A NAME="741"></A>Augustus, did better, seeing that he had aspired. All other things princes 
<A NAME="742"></A>have as a matter of course; one thing they ought insatiably to pursue, 
<A NAME="743"></A>that their memory may be glorious. For to despise fame is to despise 
<A NAME="744"></A>merit."
<A NAME="745"></A><BR><BR>Sejanus meanwhile, dazed by his extravagant prosperity and urged 
<A NAME="746"></A>on too by a woman's passion, Livia now insisting on his promise of marriage, 
<A NAME="747"></A>addressed a memorial to the emperor. For it was then the custom to apply 
<A NAME="748"></A>to him by writing, even though he was at Rome. This petition was to the 
<A NAME="749"></A>following effect:- The kindness of Augustus, the father, and then the many 
<A NAME="750"></A>favourable testimonies of Tiberius, the son, had engendered the habit of 
<A NAME="751"></A>confiding his hopes and wishes to the ears of emperors as readily as to 
<A NAME="752"></A>those of the gods. The splendour of high distinctions he had never craved; 
<A NAME="753"></A>he had rather chosen watchings and hardships, like one of the common soldiers, 
<A NAME="754"></A>for the emperor's safety. But there was one most glorious honour he had 
<A NAME="755"></A>won, the reputation of being worthy of an alliance with a Caesar. This 
<A NAME="756"></A>was the first motive of his ambition. As he had heard that Augustus, in 
<A NAME="757"></A>marrying his daughter, had even entertained some thoughts of Roman knights, 
<A NAME="758"></A>so if a husband were sought for Livia, he hoped Tiberius would bear in 
<A NAME="759"></A>mind a friend who would find his reward simply in the glory of the alliance. 
<A NAME="760"></A>He did not wish to rid himself of the duties imposed on him; he thought 
<A NAME="761"></A>it enough for his family to be secured against the unjust displeasure of 
<A NAME="762"></A>Agrippina, and this for the sake of his children. For, as for himself, 
<A NAME="763"></A>enough and more than enough for him would be a life completed while such 
<A NAME="764"></A>a sovereign still reigned.
<A NAME="765"></A><BR><BR>Tiberius, in reply, after praising the loyal sentiments of Sejanus 
<A NAME="766"></A>and briefly enumerating the favours he had bestowed on him, asked time 
<A NAME="767"></A>for impartial consideration, adding that while other men's plans depended 
<A NAME="768"></A>on their ideas of their own interest, princes, who had to regulate their 
<A NAME="769"></A>chief actions by public opinion, were in a different position. "Hence," 
<A NAME="770"></A>he said, "I do not take refuge in an answer which it would be easy to return, 
<A NAME="771"></A>that Livia can herself decide whether she considers that, after Drusus, 
<A NAME="772"></A>she ought again to marry or rather to endure life in the same home, and 
<A NAME="773"></A>that she has in her mother and grandmother counsellors nearer and dearer 
<A NAME="774"></A>to her. I will deal more frankly. First, as to the enmity of Agrippina, 
<A NAME="775"></A>I maintain that it will blaze out more fiercely if Livia's marriage rends, 
<A NAME="776"></A>so to say, the house of the Caesars into two factions. Even as it is, feminine 
<A NAME="777"></A>jealousies break out, and my grandsons are torn asunder by the strife. 
<A NAME="778"></A>What will happen if the rivalry is rendered more intense by such a marriage? 
<A NAME="779"></A>For you are mistaken, Sejanus, if you think that you will then remain in 
<A NAME="780"></A>the same position, and that Livia, who has been the wife of Caius Caesar 
<A NAME="781"></A>and afterwards of Drusus, will have the inclination to pass her old age 
<A NAME="782"></A>with a mere Roman knight. Though I might allow it, do you imagine it would 
<A NAME="783"></A>be tolerated by those who have seen her brother, her father, and our ancestors 
<A NAME="784"></A>in the highest offices of state? You indeed desire to keep within your 
<A NAME="785"></A>station; but those magistrates and nobles who intrude on you against your 
<A NAME="786"></A>wishes and consult you on all matters, openly give out that you have long 
<A NAME="787"></A>overstepped the rank of a knight and gone far beyond my father's friendships, 
<A NAME="788"></A>and from their dislike of you they also condemn me. But, you say, Augustus 
<A NAME="789"></A>had thoughts of giving his daughter to a Roman knight. Is it surprising 
<A NAME="790"></A>that, with so many distracting cares, foreseeing too the immense elevation 
<A NAME="791"></A>to which a man would be raised above others by such an alliance, he talked 
<A NAME="792"></A>of Caius Proculeius and certain persons of singularly quiet life, wholly 
<A NAME="793"></A>free from political entanglements? Still, if the hesitation of Augustus 
<A NAME="794"></A>is to influence us, how much stronger is the fact that he bestowed his 
<A NAME="795"></A>daughter on Marcus Agrippa, then on myself. All this, as a friend, I have 
<A NAME="796"></A>stated without reserve, but I will not oppose your plans or those of Livia. 
<A NAME="797"></A>My own earnest thoughts and the ties with which I am still purposing to 
<A NAME="798"></A>unite you to myself, I shall for the present forbear to explain. This only 
<A NAME="799"></A>I will declare, that nothing is too grand to be deserved by your merits 
<A NAME="800"></A>and your goodwill towards me. When an opportunity presents itself, either 
<A NAME="801"></A>in the Senate, or in a popular assembly, I shall not be 
<A NAME="802"></A>silent."
<A NAME="803"></A><BR><BR>Sejanus, no longer thinking of his marriage but filled with a deeper 
<A NAME="804"></A>alarm, rejoined by deprecating the whispers of suspicion, popular rumour 
<A NAME="805"></A>and the gathering storm of odium. That he might not impair his influence 
<A NAME="806"></A>by closing his doors on the throngs of his many visitors or strengthen 
<A NAME="807"></A>the hands of accusers by admitting them, he made it his aim to induce Tiberius 
<A NAME="808"></A>to live in some charming spot at a distance from Rome. In this he foresaw 
<A NAME="809"></A>several advantages. Access to the emperor would be under his own control, 
<A NAME="810"></A>and letters, for the most part being conveyed by soldiers, would pass through 
<A NAME="811"></A>his hands. Caesar too, who was already in the decline of life, would soon, 
<A NAME="812"></A>when enervated by retirement, more readily transfer to him the functions 
<A NAME="813"></A>of empire; envy towards himself would be lessened when there was an end 
<A NAME="814"></A>to his crowded levies and the reality of power would be increased by the 
<A NAME="815"></A>removal of its empty show. So he began to declaim against the laborious 
<A NAME="816"></A>life of the capital, the bustling crowds and streaming multitudes, while 
<A NAME="817"></A>he praised repose and solitude, with their freedom from vexations and misunderstandings, 
<A NAME="818"></A>and their special opportunities for the study of the highest 
<A NAME="819"></A>questions.
<A NAME="820"></A><BR><BR>It happened that the trial at this time of Votienus Montanus, a 
<A NAME="821"></A>popular wit, convinced the hesitating Tiberius that he ought to shun all 
<A NAME="822"></A>assemblies of the Senate, where speeches, often true and offensive, were 
<A NAME="823"></A>flung in his very face. Votienus was charged with insulting expressions 
<A NAME="824"></A>towards the emperor, and while the witness, Aemilius, a military man, in 
<A NAME="825"></A>his eagerness to prove the case, repeated the whole story and amid angry 
<A NAME="826"></A>clamour struggled on with loud assertion, Tiberius heard the reproaches 
<A NAME="827"></A>by which he was assailed in secret, and was so deeply impressed that he 
<A NAME="828"></A>exclaimed that he would clear himself either at once or on a legal inquiry, 
<A NAME="829"></A>and the entreaties of friends, with the flattery of the whole assembly, 
<A NAME="830"></A>hardly restored his composure. As for Votienus, he suffered the penalty 
<A NAME="831"></A>of treason; but the emperor, clinging all the more obstinately to the harshness 
<A NAME="832"></A>with which he had been reproached in regard to accused persons, punished 
<A NAME="833"></A>Aquilia with exile for the crime of adultery with Varius Ligur, although 
<A NAME="834"></A>Lentulus Gaetulicus, the consul-elect, had proposed that she should be 
<A NAME="835"></A>sentenced under the Julian law. He next struck off Apidius Merula from 
<A NAME="836"></A>the register of the Senate for not having sworn obedience to the legislation 
<A NAME="837"></A>of the Divine Augustus.
<A NAME="838"></A><BR><BR>Then a hearing was given to embassies from the Lacedaemonians and 
<A NAME="839"></A>Messenians on the question of the temple of Diana in the Marshes. The Lacedaemonians 
<A NAME="840"></A>asserted that it had been dedicated by their ancestors and in their territory, 
<A NAME="841"></A>and appealed to the records of their history and the hymns of poets, but 
<A NAME="842"></A>it had been wrested from, they said, by the arms of the Macedonian Philip, 
<A NAME="843"></A>with whom they had fought, and subsequently restored by the decision of 
<A NAME="844"></A>Caius Caesar and Marcus Antonius. The Messenians, on the contrary, alleged 
<A NAME="845"></A>the ancient division of the Peloponnesus among the descendants of Hercules, 
<A NAME="846"></A>in which the territory of Denthelia (where the temple stood) had fallen 
<A NAME="847"></A>to their king. Records of this event still existed, engraven on stone and 
<A NAME="848"></A>ancient bronze. But if they were asked for the testimony of poetry and 
<A NAME="849"></A>of history, they had it, they said, in greater abundance and authenticity. 
<A NAME="850"></A>Philip had not decided arbitrarily, but according to fact, and king Antigonus, 
<A NAME="851"></A>as also the general Mummius, had pronounced the same judgment. Such too 
<A NAME="852"></A>had been the award of the Milesians to whom the arbitration had been publicly 
<A NAME="853"></A>entrusted, and, finally, of Atidius Geminus, the praetor of Achaia. And 
<A NAME="854"></A>so the question was decided in favour of the Messenians.
<A NAME="855"></A><BR><BR>Next the people of Segesta petitioned for the restoration of the 
<A NAME="856"></A>temple of Venus at Mount Eryx, which had fallen to ruin from its antiquity. 
<A NAME="857"></A>They repeated the well-known story of its origin, which delighted Tiberius. 
<A NAME="858"></A>He undertook the work willingly, as being a kinsman of the goddess. After 
<A NAME="859"></A>this was discussed a petition from the city of Massilia, and sanction given 
<A NAME="860"></A>to the precedent of Publius Rutilius, who having been legally banished 
<A NAME="861"></A>from Rome, had been adopted as a citizen by the people of Smyrna. Volcatius 
<A NAME="862"></A>Moschus, also an exile, had been received with a similar privilege by the 
<A NAME="863"></A>inhabitants of Massilia, and had left his property to their community, 
<A NAME="864"></A>as being now his own country.
<A NAME="865"></A><BR><BR>Two men of noble rank died in that year, Cneius Lentulus and Lucius 
<A NAME="866"></A>Domitius. It had been the glory of Lentulus, to say nothing of his consulship 
<A NAME="867"></A>and his triumphal distinctions over the Gaetuli, to have borne poverty 
<A NAME="868"></A>with a good grace, then to have attained great wealth, which had been blamelessly 
<A NAME="869"></A>acquired and was modestly enjoyed. Domitius derived lustre from a father 
<A NAME="870"></A>who during the civil war had been master of the sea, till he united himself 
<A NAME="871"></A>to the party of Antonius and afterwards to that of Caesar. His grandfather 
<A NAME="872"></A>had fallen in the battle of Pharsalia, fighting for the aristocracy. He 
<A NAME="873"></A>had himself been chosen to be the husband of the younger Antonia, daughter 
<A NAME="874"></A>of Octavia, and subsequently led an army across the Elbe, penetrating further 
<A NAME="875"></A>into Germany than any Roman before him. For this achievement he gained 
<A NAME="876"></A>triumphal honours.
<A NAME="877"></A><BR><BR>Lucius Antonius too then died, of a most illustrious but unfortunate 
<A NAME="878"></A>family. His father, Julius Antonius, was capitally punished for adultery 
<A NAME="879"></A>with Julia, and the son, when a mere youth, was banished by Augustus, whose 
<A NAME="880"></A>sister's grandson he was, to the city of Massilia, where the name of exile 
<A NAME="881"></A>might be masked under that of student. Yet honour was paid him in death, 
<A NAME="882"></A>and his bones, by the Senate's decree, were consigned to the sepulchre 
<A NAME="883"></A>of the Octavii.
<A NAME="884"></A><BR><BR>While the same consuls were in office, an atrocious crime was committed 
<A NAME="885"></A>in Nearer Spain by a peasant of the Termestine tribe. Suddenly attacking 
<A NAME="886"></A>the praetor of the province, Lucius Piso, as he was travelling in all the 
<A NAME="887"></A>carelessness of peace, he killed him with a single wound. He then fled 
<A NAME="888"></A>on a swift horse, and reached a wooded country, where he parted with his 
<A NAME="889"></A>steed and eluded pursuit amid rocky and pathless wilds. But he was soon 
<A NAME="890"></A>discovered. The horse was caught and led through the neighbouring villages, 
<A NAME="891"></A>and its owner ascertained. Being found and put to the torture that he might 
<A NAME="892"></A>be forced to reveal his accomplices, he exclaimed in a loud voice, in the 
<A NAME="893"></A>language of his country, that it was in vain to question him; his comrades 
<A NAME="894"></A>might stand by and look on, but that the most intense agony would not wring 
<A NAME="895"></A>the truth from him. Next day, when he was dragged back to torture, he broke 
<A NAME="896"></A>loose from his guards and dashed his head against a stone with such violence 
<A NAME="897"></A>that he instantly fell dead. It was however believed that Piso was treacherously 
<A NAME="898"></A>murdered by the Termestini. Some public money had been embezzled, and he 
<A NAME="899"></A>was pressing for its payment too rigorously for the patience of 
<A NAME="900"></A>barbarians.
<A NAME="901"></A><BR><BR>In the consulship of Lentulus Gaetulicus and Caius Calvisius, triumphal 
<A NAME="902"></A>distinctions were decreed to Poppaeus Sabinus, for a crushing defeat of 
<A NAME="903"></A>some Thracian tribes, whose wild life in the highlands of a mountainous 
<A NAME="904"></A>country made them unusually fierce. Besides their natural ferocity, the 
<A NAME="905"></A>rebellion had its origin in their scornful refusal to endure levies and 
<A NAME="906"></A>to supply our armies with their bravest men. Even native princes they would 
<A NAME="907"></A>obey only according to their caprice, and if they sent aid, they used to 
<A NAME="908"></A>appoint their own leaders and fight only against their neighbours. A rumour 
<A NAME="909"></A>had then spread itself among them that, dispersed and mingled with other 
<A NAME="910"></A>tribes, they were to be dragged away to distant countries. Before however 
<A NAME="911"></A>they took up arms, they sent envoys with assurances of their friendship 
<A NAME="912"></A>and loyalty, which, they said, would continue, if they were not tried by 
<A NAME="913"></A>any fresh burden. But if they were doomed to slavery as a conquered people, 
<A NAME="914"></A>they had swords and young warriors and a spirit bent on freedom or resigned 
<A NAME="915"></A>to death. As they spoke, they pointed to fortresses amid rocks whither 
<A NAME="916"></A>they had conveyed their parents and their wives, and threatened us with 
<A NAME="917"></A>a difficult, dangerous and sanguinary war.
<A NAME="918"></A><BR><BR>Sabinus meantime, while he was concentrating his troops, returned 
<A NAME="919"></A>gentle answers; but on the arrival of Pomponius Labeo with a legion from 
<A NAME="920"></A>Moesia and of king Rhoemetalces with some reinforcements from his subjects, 
<A NAME="921"></A>who had not thrown off their allegiance, with these and the force he had 
<A NAME="922"></A>on the spot, he advanced on the enemy, who were drawn up in some wooded 
<A NAME="923"></A>defiles. Some ventured to show themselves on the open hills; these the 
<A NAME="924"></A>Roman general approached in fighting order and easily dislodged them, with 
<A NAME="925"></A>only a small slaughter of the barbarians, who had not far to flee. In this 
<A NAME="926"></A>position he soon established a camp, and held with a strong detachment 
<A NAME="927"></A>a narrow and unbroken mountain ridge, stretching as far as the next fortress, 
<A NAME="928"></A>which was garrisoned by a large force of armed soldiers along with some 
<A NAME="929"></A>irregulars. Against the boldest of these, who after the manner of their 
<A NAME="930"></A>country were disporting themselves with songs and dances in front of the 
<A NAME="931"></A>rampart, he sent some picked archers, who, discharging distant volleys, 
<A NAME="932"></A>inflicted many wounds without loss to themselves. As they advanced, a sudden 
<A NAME="933"></A>sortie put them to the rout, and they fell back on the support of a Sugambrian 
<A NAME="934"></A>cohort, drawn up at no great distance by the Roman general, ready for any 
<A NAME="935"></A>emergency and as terrible as the foe, with the noise of their war songs 
<A NAME="936"></A>and the clashing of their arms.
<A NAME="937"></A><BR><BR>He then moved his camp near to the enemy, leaving in his former 
<A NAME="938"></A>entrenchments the Thracians who, as I have mentioned, were with us. These 
<A NAME="939"></A>had permission to ravage, burn, and plunder, provided they confined their 
<A NAME="940"></A>forays to daylight, and passed the night securely and vigilantly in their 
<A NAME="941"></A>camp. This at first they strictly observed. Soon they resigned themselves 
<A NAME="942"></A>to enjoyment, and, enriched by plunder, they neglected their guards, and 
<A NAME="943"></A>amid feasts and mirth sank down in the carelessness of the banquet, of 
<A NAME="944"></A>sleep and of wine. So the enemy, apprised of their heedlessness, prepared 
<A NAME="945"></A>two detachments, one of which was to attack the plunderers, the other, 
<A NAME="946"></A>to fall on the Roman camp, not with the hope of taking it, but to hinder 
<A NAME="947"></A>the din of the other battle from being heard by our soldiers, who, with 
<A NAME="948"></A>shouts and missiles around them, would be all intent on their own peril. 
<A NAME="949"></A>Night too was chosen for the movement to increase the panic. Those however 
<A NAME="950"></A>who tried to storm the entrenchment of the legions were easily repulsed; 
<A NAME="951"></A>the Thracian auxiliaries were dismayed by the suddenness of the onset, 
<A NAME="952"></A>for though some were lying close to their lines, far more were straggling 
<A NAME="953"></A>beyond them, and the massacre was all the more savage, inasmuch as they 
<A NAME="954"></A>were taunted with being fugitives and traitors and bearing arms for their 
<A NAME="955"></A>own and their country's enslavement.
<A NAME="956"></A><BR><BR>Next day Sabinus displayed his forces in the plain, on the chance 
<A NAME="957"></A>of the barbarians being encouraged by the night's success to risk an engagement. 
<A NAME="958"></A>Finding that they did not quit the fortress and the adjoining hills, he 
<A NAME="959"></A>began a siege by means of the works which he had opportunely began to construct; 
<A NAME="960"></A>then he drew a fosse and stockade enclosing an extent of four miles, and 
<A NAME="961"></A>by degrees contracted and narrowed his lines, with the view of cutting 
<A NAME="962"></A>off their water and forage. He also threw up a rampart, from which to discharge 
<A NAME="963"></A>stones, darts, and brands on the enemy, who was now within range. It was 
<A NAME="964"></A>thirst however which chiefly distressed them, for there was only one spring 
<A NAME="965"></A>for the use of a vast multitude of soldiers and non-combatants. Their cattle 
<A NAME="966"></A>too, penned up close to them, after the fashion of barbarians, were dying 
<A NAME="967"></A>of want of fodder; near them lay human bodies which had perished from wounds 
<A NAME="968"></A>or thirst, and the whole place was befouled with rotting carcases and stench 
<A NAME="969"></A>and infection. To their confusion was added the growing misery of discord, 
<A NAME="970"></A>some thinking of surrender, others of destruction by mutual blows. Some 
<A NAME="971"></A>there were who suggested a sortie instead of an unavenged death, and these 
<A NAME="972"></A>were all men of spirit, though they differed in their 
<A NAME="973"></A>plans.
<A NAME="974"></A><BR><BR>One of their chiefs, Dinis, an old man who well knew by long experience 
<A NAME="975"></A>both the strength and clemency of Rome, maintained that they must lay down 
<A NAME="976"></A>their arms, this being the only remedy for their wretched plight, and he 
<A NAME="977"></A>was the first to give himself up with his wife and children to the conqueror. 
<A NAME="978"></A>He was followed by all whom age or sex unfitted for war, by all too who 
<A NAME="979"></A>had a stronger love of life than of renown. The young were divided between 
<A NAME="980"></A>Tarsa and Turesis, both of whom had resolved to fall together with their 
<A NAME="981"></A>freedom. Tarsa however kept urging them to speedy death and to the instant 
<A NAME="982"></A>breaking off of all hope and fear, and, by way of example, plunged his 
<A NAME="983"></A>sword into his heart. And there were some who chose the same death. Turesis 
<A NAME="984"></A>and his band waited for night, not without the knowledge of our general. 
<A NAME="985"></A>Consequently, the sentries were strengthened with denser masses of troops. 
<A NAME="986"></A>Night was coming on with a fierce storm, and the foe, one moment with a 
<A NAME="987"></A>tumultuous uproar, another in awful silence, had perplexed the besiegers, 
<A NAME="988"></A>when Sabinus went round the camp, entreating the men not to give a chance 
<A NAME="989"></A>to their stealthy assailants by heeding embarrassing noises or being deceived 
<A NAME="990"></A>by quiet, but to keep, every one, to his post without moving or discharging 
<A NAME="991"></A>their darts on false alarms.
<A NAME="992"></A><BR><BR>The barbarians meanwhile rushed down with their bands, now hurling 
<A NAME="993"></A>at the entrenchments stones such as the hand could grasp, stakes with points 
<A NAME="994"></A>hardened by fire, and boughs lopped from oaks; now filling up the fosses 
<A NAME="995"></A>with bushes and hurdles and dead bodies, while others advanced up to the 
<A NAME="996"></A>breastwork with bridges and ladders which they had constructed for the 
<A NAME="997"></A>occasion, seized it, tore it down, and came to close quarters with the 
<A NAME="998"></A>defenders. Our soldiers on the other side drove them back with missiles, 
<A NAME="999"></A>repelled them with their shields, and covered them with a storm of long 
<A NAME="1000"></A>siege-javelins and heaps of stones. Success already gained and the more 
<A NAME="1001"></A>marked disgrace which would follow repulse, were a stimulus to the Romans, 
<A NAME="1002"></A>while the courage of the foe was heightened by this last chance of deliverance 
<A NAME="1003"></A>and the presence of many mothers and wives with mournful cries. Darkness, 
<A NAME="1004"></A>which increased the daring of some and the terror of others, random blows, 
<A NAME="1005"></A>wounds not foreseen, failure to recognise friend or enemy, echoes, seemingly 
<A NAME="1006"></A>in their rear, from the winding mountain valleys, spread such confusion 
<A NAME="1007"></A>that the Romans abandoned some of their lines in the belief that they had 
<A NAME="1008"></A>been stormed. Only however a very few of the enemy had broken through them; 
<A NAME="1009"></A>the rest, after their bravest men had been beaten back or wounded, were 
<A NAME="1010"></A>towards daybreak pushed back to the upper part of the fortress and there 
<A NAME="1011"></A>at last compelled to surrender. Then the immediate neighbourhood, by the 
<A NAME="1012"></A>voluntary action of the inhabitants, submitted. The early and severe winter 
<A NAME="1013"></A>of Mount Haemus saved the rest of the population from being reduced by 
<A NAME="1014"></A>assault or blockade.
<A NAME="1015"></A><BR><BR>At Rome meanwhile, besides the shocks already sustained by the 
<A NAME="1016"></A>imperial house, came the first step towards the destruction of Agrippina, 
<A NAME="1017"></A>Claudia Pulchra, her cousin, being prosecuted by Domitius Afer. Lately 
<A NAME="1018"></A>a praetor, a man of but moderate position and eager to become notorious 
<A NAME="1019"></A>by any sort of deed, Afer charged her with unchastity, with having Furnius 
<A NAME="1020"></A>for her paramour, and with attempts on the emperor by poison and sorcery. 
<A NAME="1021"></A>Agrippina, always impetuous, and now kindled into fury by the peril of 
<A NAME="1022"></A>her kinswoman, went straight to Tiberius and found him, as it happened, 
<A NAME="1023"></A>offering a sacrifice to his father. This provoked an indignant outburst. 
<A NAME="1024"></A>"It is not," she exclaimed, "for the same man to slay victims to the Divine 
<A NAME="1025"></A>Augustus and to persecute his posterity. The celestial spirit has not transferred 
<A NAME="1026"></A>itself to the mute statue; here is the true image, sprung of heavenly blood, 
<A NAME="1027"></A>and she perceives her danger, and assumes its mournful emblems. Pulchra's 
<A NAME="1028"></A>name is a mere blind; the only reason for her destruction is that she has, 
<A NAME="1029"></A>in utter folly, selected Agrippina for her admiration, forgetting that 
<A NAME="1030"></A>Sosia was thereby ruined." These words wrung from the emperor one of the 
<A NAME="1031"></A>rare utterances of that inscrutable breast; he rebuked Agrippina with a 
<A NAME="1032"></A>Greek verse, and reminded her that "she was not wronged because she was 
<A NAME="1033"></A>not a queen." Pulchra and Furnius were condemned. Afer was ranked with 
<A NAME="1034"></A>the foremost orators, for the ability which he displayed, and which won 
<A NAME="1035"></A>strong praise from Tiberius, who pronounced him a speaker of natural genius. 
<A NAME="1036"></A>Henceforward as a counsel for the defence or the prosecution he enjoyed 
<A NAME="1037"></A>the fame of eloquence rather than of virtue, but old age robbed him of 
<A NAME="1038"></A>much of his speaking power, while, with a failing intellect, he was still 
<A NAME="1039"></A>impatient of silence.
<A NAME="1040"></A><BR><BR>Agrippina in stubborn rage, with the grasp of disease yet on her, 
<A NAME="1041"></A>when the emperor came to see her, wept long and silently, and then began 
<A NAME="1042"></A>to mingle reproach and supplication. She begged him "to relieve her loneliness 
<A NAME="1043"></A>and provide her with a husband; her youth still fitted her for marriage, 
<A NAME="1044"></A>which was a virtuous woman's only solace, and there were citizens in Rome 
<A NAME="1045"></A>who would not disdain to receive the wife of Germanicus and his children." 
<A NAME="1046"></A>But the emperor, who perceived the political aims of her request, but did 
<A NAME="1047"></A>not wish to show displeasure or apprehension, left her, notwithstanding 
<A NAME="1048"></A>her urgency, without an answer. This incident, not mentioned by any historian, 
<A NAME="1049"></A>I have found in the memoirs of the younger Agrippina, the mother of the 
<A NAME="1050"></A>emperor Nero, who handed down to posterity the story of her life and of 
<A NAME="1051"></A>the misfortunes of her family.
<A NAME="1052"></A><BR><BR>Sejanus meanwhile yet more deeply alarmed the sorrowing and unsuspecting 
<A NAME="1053"></A>woman by sending his agents, under the guise of friendship, with warnings 
<A NAME="1054"></A>that poison was prepared for her, and that she ought to avoid her father-in-law's 
<A NAME="1055"></A>table. Knowing not how to dissemble, she relaxed neither her features nor 
<A NAME="1056"></A>tone of voice as she sat by him at dinner, nor did she touch a single dish, 
<A NAME="1057"></A>till at last Tiberius noticed her conduct, either casually or because he 
<A NAME="1058"></A>was told of it. To test her more closely, he praised some fruit as it was 
<A NAME="1059"></A>set on the table and passed it with his own hand to his daughter-in-law. 
<A NAME="1060"></A>This increased the suspicions of Agrippina, and without putting the fruit 
<A NAME="1061"></A>to her lips she gave it to the slaves. Still no remark fell from Tiberius 
<A NAME="1062"></A>before the company, but he turned to his mother and whispered that it was 
<A NAME="1063"></A>not surprising if he had decided on harsh treatment against one who implied 
<A NAME="1064"></A>that he was a poisoner. Then there was a rumour that a plan was laid for 
<A NAME="1065"></A>her destruction, that the emperor did not dare to attempt it openly, and 
<A NAME="1066"></A>was seeking to veil the deed in secrecy.
<A NAME="1067"></A><BR><BR>Tiberius, to divert people's talk, continually attended the Senate, 
<A NAME="1068"></A>and gave an audience of several days to embassies from Asia on a disputed 
<A NAME="1069"></A>question as to the city in which the temple before mentioned should be 
<A NAME="1070"></A>erected. Eleven cities were rivals for the honour, of which they were all 
<A NAME="1071"></A>equally ambitious, though they differed widely in resources. With little 
<A NAME="1072"></A>variation they dwelt on antiquity of race and loyalty to Rome throughout 
<A NAME="1073"></A>her wars with Perseus, Aristonicus, and other kings. But the people of 
<A NAME="1074"></A>Hypaepa, Tralles, Laodicaea, and Magnesia were passed over as too insignificant; 
<A NAME="1075"></A>even Ilium, though it boasted that Troy was the cradle of Rome, was strong 
<A NAME="1076"></A>only in the glory of its antiquity. There was a little hesitation about 
<A NAME="1077"></A>Halicarnassus, as its inhabitants affirmed that for twelve hundred years 
<A NAME="1078"></A>their homes had not been shaken by an earthquake and that the foundations 
<A NAME="1079"></A>of their temple were on the living rock. Pergamos, it was thought, had 
<A NAME="1080"></A>been sufficiently honoured by having a temple of Augustus in the city, 
<A NAME="1081"></A>on which very fact they relied. The Ephesians and Milesians had, it seemed, 
<A NAME="1082"></A>wholly devoted their respective towns to the worships of Apollo and Diana. 
<A NAME="1083"></A>And so the qu
