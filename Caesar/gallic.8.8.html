<A NAME="start"></A>
<A NAME="10"></A><B>Chapter 0</B>
<A NAME="11"></A><BR><BR>Prevailed on by your continued solicitations, Balbus, I have engaged 
<A NAME="12"></A>in a most difficult task, as my daily refusals appear to plead not my inability, 
<A NAME="13"></A>but indolence, as an excuse. I have compiled a continuation of the Commentaries 
<A NAME="14"></A>of our Caesar's Wars in Gaul, not indeed to be compared to his writings, 
<A NAME="15"></A>which either precede or follow them; and recently, I have completed what 
<A NAME="16"></A>he left imperfect after the transactions in Alexandria, to the end, not 
<A NAME="17"></A>indeed of the civil broils, to which we see no issue, but of Caesar's life. 
<A NAME="18"></A>I wish that those who may read them could know how unwillingly I undertook 
<A NAME="19"></A>to write them, as then I might the more readily escape the imputation of 
<A NAME="20"></A>folly and arrogance, in presuming to intrude among Caesar's writings. For 
<A NAME="21"></A>it is agreed on all hands, that no composition was ever executed with so 
<A NAME="22"></A>great care, that it is not exceeded in elegance by these Commentaries, 
<A NAME="23"></A>which were published for the use of historians, that they might not want 
<A NAME="24"></A>memoirs of such achievements; and they stand so high in the esteem of all 
<A NAME="25"></A>men, that historians seem rather deprived of, than furnished with material. 
<A NAME="26"></A>At which we have more reason to be surprised than other men; for they can 
<A NAME="27"></A>only appreciate the elegance and correctness with which he finished them, 
<A NAME="28"></A>while we know with what ease and expedition. Caesar possessed not only 
<A NAME="29"></A>an uncommon flow of language and elegance of style, but also a thorough 
<A NAME="30"></A>knowledge of the method of conveying his ideas. But I had not even the 
<A NAME="31"></A>good fortune to share in the Alexandrian or African war; and though these 
<A NAME="32"></A>were partly communicated to me by Caesar himself, in conversation, yet 
<A NAME="33"></A>we listen with a different degree of attention to those things which strike 
<A NAME="34"></A>us with admiration by their novelty, and those which we design to attest 
<A NAME="35"></A>to posterity. But, in truth, while I urge every apology, that I may not 
<A NAME="36"></A>be compared to Caesar, I incur the charge of vanity, by thinking it possible 
<A NAME="37"></A>that I can in the judgment of any one be put in competition with him. 
<A NAME="38"></A>Farewell.
<A NAME="39"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 1</B>
<A NAME="40"></A><BR><BR>Gaul being entirely reduced, when Caesar having waged war incessantly 
<A NAME="41"></A>during the former summer, wished to recruit his soldiers after so much 
<A NAME="42"></A>fatigue, by repose in winter quarters, news was brought him that several 
<A NAME="43"></A>states were simultaneously renewing their hostile intention, and forming 
<A NAME="44"></A>combinations. For which a probable reason was assigned; namely, that the 
<A NAME="45"></A>Gauls were convinced that they were not able to resist the Romans, with 
<A NAME="46"></A>any force they could collect in one place; and hoped that if several states 
<A NAME="47"></A>made war in different places at the same time, the Roman army would neither 
<A NAME="48"></A>have aid, nor time, nor forces, to prosecute them all: nor ought any single 
<A NAME="49"></A>state to decline any inconveniences that might befall them, provided that 
<A NAME="50"></A>by such delay, the rest should be enabled to assert their 
<A NAME="51"></A>liberty.
<A NAME="52"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 2</B>
<A NAME="53"></A><BR><BR>That this notion might not be confirmed among the Gauls, Caesar 
<A NAME="54"></A>left Marcus Antonius, his questor, in charge of his quarters, and set out 
<A NAME="55"></A>himself with a guard of horse, the day before the kalends of January, from 
<A NAME="56"></A>the town Bibracte, to the thirteenth legion, which he had stationed in 
<A NAME="57"></A>the country of the Bituriges, not far from the territories of the Aedui, 
<A NAME="58"></A>and joined to it the eleventh legion which was next it. Leaving two cohorts 
<A NAME="59"></A>to guard the baggage, he leads the rest of his army into the most plentiful 
<A NAME="60"></A>part of the country of the Bituriges; who, possessing an extensive territory 
<A NAME="61"></A>and several towns, were not to be deterred, by a single legion quartered 
<A NAME="62"></A>among them, from making warlike preparation, and forming 
<A NAME="63"></A>combinations.
<A NAME="64"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 3</B>
<A NAME="65"></A><BR><BR>By Caesar's sudden arrival, it happened, as it necessarily must, 
<A NAME="66"></A>to an unprovided and dispersed people, that they were surprised by our 
<A NAME="67"></A>horse, while cultivating the fields without any apprehensions, before they 
<A NAME="68"></A>had time to fly to their towns. For the usual sign of an enemy's invasion, 
<A NAME="69"></A>which is generally intimated by the burning of their towns, was forbidden 
<A NAME="70"></A>by Caesar's orders; lest if he advanced far, forage and corn should become 
<A NAME="71"></A>scarce, or the enemy be warned by the fires to make their escape. Many 
<A NAME="72"></A>thousands being taken, as many of the Bituriges as were able to escape 
<A NAME="73"></A>the first coming of the Romans, fled to the neighboring states, relying 
<A NAME="74"></A>either on private friendship, or public alliance. In vain; for Caesar, 
<A NAME="75"></A>by hasty marches, anticipated them in every place, nor did he allow any 
<A NAME="76"></A>state leisure to consider the safety of others, in preference to their 
<A NAME="77"></A>own. By this activity, he both retained his friends in their loyalty, and 
<A NAME="78"></A>by fear, obliged the wavering to accept offers of peace. Such offers being 
<A NAME="79"></A>made to the Bituriges, when they perceived that through Caesar's clemency, 
<A NAME="80"></A>an avenue was open to his friendship, and that the neighboring states had 
<A NAME="81"></A>given hostages, without incurring any punishment, and had been received 
<A NAME="82"></A>under his protection, they did the same.
<A NAME="83"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 4</B>
<A NAME="84"></A><BR><BR>Caesar promises his soldiers, as a reward for their labor and patience, 
<A NAME="85"></A>in cheerfully submitting to hardships from the severity of the winter, 
<A NAME="86"></A>the difficulty of the roads, and the intolerable cold, two hundred sestertii 
<A NAME="87"></A>each, and to every centurian two thousand, to be given instead of plunder: 
<A NAME="88"></A>and sending his legions back to quarters, he himself returned on the fortieth 
<A NAME="89"></A>day to Bibracte. While he was dispensing justice there, the Bituriges send 
<A NAME="90"></A>embassadors to him, to entreat his aid against the Carnutes, who they complained 
<A NAME="91"></A>had made war against them. Upon this intelligence, though he had not remained 
<A NAME="92"></A>more than eighteen days in winter quarters, he draws the fourteenth and 
<A NAME="93"></A>sixth legion out of quarters on the Saone, where he had posted them as 
<A NAME="94"></A>mentioned in a former Commentary, to procure supplies of corn. With these 
<A NAME="95"></A>two legions he marches in pursuit of the Carnutes.
<A NAME="96"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 5</B>
<A NAME="97"></A><BR><BR>When the news of the approach of our army reached the enemy, the 
<A NAME="98"></A>Carnutes, terrified by the suffering of other states, deserted their villages 
<A NAME="99"></A>and towns (which were small buildings, raised in a hurry, to meet the immediate 
<A NAME="100"></A>necessity, in which they lived to shelter themselves against the winter, 
<A NAME="101"></A>for, being lately conquered, they had lost several towns), and dispersed 
<A NAME="102"></A>and fled. Caesar, unwilling to expose his soldiers to the violent storms 
<A NAME="103"></A>that break out, especially at that season, took up his quarters at Genabum, 
<A NAME="104"></A>a town of the Carnutes; and lodged his men in houses, partly belonging 
<A NAME="105"></A>to the Gauls, and partly built to shelter the tents, and hastily covered 
<A NAME="106"></A>with thatch. But the horse and auxiliaries he sends to all parts to which 
<A NAME="107"></A>he was told the enemy had marched; and not without effect, as our men generally 
<A NAME="108"></A>returned loaded with booty. The Carnutes, overpowered by the severity of 
<A NAME="109"></A>the winter, and the fear of danger, and not daring to continue long in 
<A NAME="110"></A>any place, as they were driven from their houses, and not finding sufficient 
<A NAME="111"></A>protection in the woods, from the violence of the storms, after losing 
<A NAME="112"></A>a considerable number of their men, disperse, and take refuge among the 
<A NAME="113"></A>neighboring states.
<A NAME="114"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 6</B>
<A NAME="115"></A><BR><BR>Caesar, being contented, at so severe a season, to disperse the 
<A NAME="116"></A>gathering foes, and prevent any new war from breaking out, and being convinced, 
<A NAME="117"></A>as far as reason could foresee, that no war of consequence could be set 
<A NAME="118"></A>on foot in the summer campaign, stationed Caius Trebonius, with the two 
<A NAME="119"></A>legions which he had with him, in quarters at Genabum: and being informed 
<A NAME="120"></A>by frequent embassies from the Remi, that the Bellovaci (who exceed all 
<A NAME="121"></A>the Gauls and Belgae in military prowess), and the neighboring states, 
<A NAME="122"></A>headed by Correus, one of the Bellovaci, and Comius, the Atrebatian, were 
<A NAME="123"></A>raising an army, and assembling at a general rendezvous, designing with 
<A NAME="124"></A>their united forces to invade the territories of the Suessiones, who were 
<A NAME="125"></A>put under the patronage of the Remi: and moreover, considering that not 
<A NAME="126"></A>only his honor, but his interest was concerned, that such of his allies, 
<A NAME="127"></A>as deserved well of the republic, should suffer no calamity; he again draws 
<A NAME="128"></A>the eleventh legion out of quarters, and writes besides to Caius Fabius, 
<A NAME="129"></A>to march with his two legions to the country of the Suessiones; and he 
<A NAME="130"></A>sends to Trebonius for one of his two legions. Thus, as far as the convenience 
<A NAME="131"></A>of the quarters, and the management of the war admitted, he laid the burden 
<A NAME="132"></A>of the expedition on the legions by turns, without any intermission to 
<A NAME="133"></A>his own toils.
<A NAME="134"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 7</B>
<A NAME="135"></A><BR><BR>As soon as his troops were collected, he marched against the Bellovaci: 
<A NAME="136"></A>and pitching his camp in their territories, detached troops of horse all 
<A NAME="137"></A>round the country, to take prisoners, from whom he might learn the enemy's 
<A NAME="138"></A>plan. The horse, having executed his orders bring him back word, that but 
<A NAME="139"></A>few were found in the houses: and that even these had not stayed at home 
<A NAME="140"></A>to cultivate their lands (for the emigration was general from all parts) 
<A NAME="141"></A>but had been sent back to watch our motions. Upon Caesar's inquiring from 
<A NAME="142"></A>them, where the main body of the Bellovaci were posted, and what was their 
<A NAME="143"></A>design: they made answer, "that all the Bellovaci, fit for carrying arms, 
<A NAME="144"></A>had assembled in one place, and along with them the Ambiani, Aulerci, Caletes, 
<A NAME="145"></A>Velocasses, and Atrebates, and that they had chosen for their camp, an 
<A NAME="146"></A>elevated position, surrounded by a dangerous morass: that they had conveyed 
<A NAME="147"></A>all their baggage into the most remote woods: that several noblemen were 
<A NAME="148"></A>united in the management of the war; but that the people were most inclined 
<A NAME="149"></A>to be governed by Correus, because they knew that he had the strongest 
<A NAME="150"></A>aversion to the name of the Roman people: that a few days before Comius 
<A NAME="151"></A>had left the camp to engage the Germans to their aid whose nation bordered 
<A NAME="152"></A>on theirs, and whose numbers were countless: that the Bellovaci had come 
<A NAME="153"></A>to a resolution, with the consent of all the generals and the earnest desire 
<A NAME="154"></A>of the people, if Caesar should come with only three legions, as was reported, 
<A NAME="155"></A>to give him battle, that they might not be obliged to encounter his whole 
<A NAME="156"></A>army on a future occasion, when they should be in a more wretched and distressed 
<A NAME="157"></A>condition; but if he brought a stronger force, they intended to remain 
<A NAME="158"></A>in the position they had chosen, and by ambuscade to prevent the Romans 
<A NAME="159"></A>from getting forage (which at that season was both scarce and much scattered), 
<A NAME="160"></A>corn, and other necessaries.
<A NAME="161"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 8</B>
<A NAME="162"></A><BR><BR>When Caesar was convinced of the truth of this account from the 
<A NAME="163"></A>concurring testimony of several persons, and perceived that the plans which 
<A NAME="164"></A>were proposed were full of prudence, and very unlike the rash resolves 
<A NAME="165"></A>of a barbarous people, he considered it incumbent on him to use every exertion, 
<A NAME="166"></A>in order that the enemy might despise his small force and come to an action. 
<A NAME="167"></A>For he had three veteran legions of distinguished valor, the seventh, eighth 
<A NAME="168"></A>and ninth. The eleventh consisted of chosen youth of great hopes, who had 
<A NAME="169"></A>served eight campaigns, but who, compared with the others, had not yet 
<A NAME="170"></A>acquired any great reputation for experience and valor. Calling therefore 
<A NAME="171"></A>a council, and laying before it the intelligence which he had received, 
<A NAME="172"></A>he encouraged his soldiers. In order if possible to entice the enemy to 
<A NAME="173"></A>an engagement by the appearance of only three legions, he ranged his army 
<A NAME="174"></A>in the following manner, that the seventh, eighth, and ninth legions should 
<A NAME="175"></A>march before all the baggage; that then the eleventh should bring up the 
<A NAME="176"></A>rear of the whole train of baggage (which however was but small, as is 
<A NAME="177"></A>usual on such expeditions), so that the enemy could not get a sight of 
<A NAME="178"></A>a greater number than they themselves were willing to encounter. By this 
<A NAME="179"></A>disposition he formed his army almost into a square, and brought them within 
<A NAME="180"></A>sight of the enemy sooner than was anticipated.
<A NAME="181"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 9</B>
<A NAME="182"></A><BR><BR>When the Gauls, whose bold resolutions had been reported to Caesar, 
<A NAME="183"></A>saw the legions advance with a regular motion, drawn up in battle array; 
<A NAME="184"></A>either from the danger of an engagement, or our sudden approach, or with 
<A NAME="185"></A>the design of watching our movements, they drew up their forces before 
<A NAME="186"></A>the camp, and did not quit the rising ground. Though Caesar wished to bring 
<A NAME="187"></A>them to battle, yet being surprised to see so vast a host of the enemy, 
<A NAME="188"></A>he encamped opposite to them, with a valley between them, deep rather than 
<A NAME="189"></A>extensive. He ordered his camp to be fortified with a rampart twelve feet 
<A NAME="190"></A>high, with breastworks built on it proportioned to its height and two trenches, 
<A NAME="191"></A>each fifteen feet broad, with perpendicular sides to be sunk: likewise 
<A NAME="192"></A>several turrets, three stories high, to be raised, with a communication 
<A NAME="193"></A>to each other by galleries laid across and covered over; which should be 
<A NAME="194"></A>guarded in front by small parapets of osiers; that the enemy might be repulsed 
<A NAME="195"></A>by two rows of soldiers. The one of whom, being more secure from danger 
<A NAME="196"></A>by their height might throw their darts with more daring and to a greater 
<A NAME="197"></A>distance; the other which was nearer the enemy, being stationed on the 
<A NAME="198"></A>rampart, would be protected by their galleries from darts falling on their 
<A NAME="199"></A>heads. At the entrance he erected gates and turrets of a considerable 
<A NAME="200"></A>height.
<A NAME="201"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 10</B>
<A NAME="202"></A><BR><BR>Caesar had a double design in this fortification; for he both hoped 
<A NAME="203"></A>that the strength of his works, and his [apparent] fears would raise confidence 
<A NAME="204"></A>in the barbarians; and when there should be occasion to make a distant 
<A NAME="205"></A>excursion to get forage or corn, he saw that his camp would be secured 
<A NAME="206"></A>by the works with a very small force. In the mean time there were frequent 
<A NAME="207"></A>skirmishes across the marsh, a few on both sides sallying out between the 
<A NAME="208"></A>two camps. Sometimes, however, our Gallic or German auxiliaries crossed 
<A NAME="209"></A>the marsh, and furiously pursued the enemy; or on the other hand the enemy 
<A NAME="210"></A>passed it and beat back our men. Moreover there happened in the course 
<A NAME="211"></A>of our daily foraging, what must of necessity happen, when corn is to be 
<A NAME="212"></A>collected by a few scattered men out of private houses, that our foragers 
<A NAME="213"></A>dispersing in an intricate country were surrounded by the enemy; by which, 
<A NAME="214"></A>though we suffered but an inconsiderable loss of cattle and servants, yet 
<A NAME="215"></A>it raised foolish hopes in the barbarians; but more especially, because 
<A NAME="216"></A>Comius, who I said had gone to get aid from the Germans, returned with 
<A NAME="217"></A>some cavalry, and though the Germans were only 500, yet the barbarians 
<A NAME="218"></A>were elated by their arrival.
<A NAME="219"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 11</B>
<A NAME="220"></A><BR><BR>Caesar, observing that the enemy kept for several days within their 
<A NAME="221"></A>camp, which was well secured by a morass and its natural situation, and 
<A NAME="222"></A>that it could not be assaulted without a dangerous engagement, nor the 
<A NAME="223"></A>place inclosed with lines without an addition to his army, wrote to Trebonius 
<A NAME="224"></A>to send with all dispatch for the thirteenth legion which was in winter 
<A NAME="225"></A>quarters among the Bituriges under Titus Sextius, one of his lieutenants; 
<A NAME="226"></A>and then to come to him by forced marches with the three legions. He himself 
<A NAME="227"></A>sent the cavalry of the Remi, and Lingones, and other states, from whom 
<A NAME="228"></A>he had required a vast number, to guard his foraging parties, and to support 
<A NAME="229"></A>them in case of any sudden attack of the enemy.
<A NAME="230"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 12</B>
<A NAME="231"></A><BR><BR>As this continued for several days, and their vigilance was relaxed 
<A NAME="232"></A>by custom (an effect which is generally produced by time), the Bellovaci, 
<A NAME="233"></A>having made themselves acquainted with the daily stations of our horse, 
<A NAME="234"></A>lie in ambush with a select body of foot in a place covered with woods; 
<A NAME="235"></A>to it they sent their horse the next day, who were first to decoy our men 
<A NAME="236"></A>into the ambuscade, and then when they were surrounded, to attack them. 
<A NAME="237"></A>It was the lot of the Remi to fall into this snare, to whom that day had 
<A NAME="238"></A>been allotted to perform this duty; for, having suddenly got sight of the 
<A NAME="239"></A>enemy's cavalry, and despising their weakness, in consequence of their 
<A NAME="240"></A>superior numbers, they pursued them too eagerly, and were surrounded on 
<A NAME="241"></A>every side by the foot. Being, by this means thrown into disorder they 
<A NAME="242"></A>returned with more precipitation than is usual in cavalry actions, with 
<A NAME="243"></A>the loss of Vertiscus the governor of their state, and the general of their 
<A NAME="244"></A>horse, who, though scarcely able to sit on horseback through years, neither, 
<A NAME="245"></A>in accordance with the custom of the Gauls, pleaded his age in excuse for 
<A NAME="246"></A>not accepting the command, nor would he suffer them to fight without him. 
<A NAME="247"></A>The spirits of the barbarians were puffed up, and inflated at the success 
<A NAME="248"></A>of this battle, in killing the prince, and general of the Remi; and our 
<A NAME="249"></A>men were taught by this loss, to examine the country, and post their guards 
<A NAME="250"></A>with more caution, and to be more moderate in pursuing a retreating 
<A NAME="251"></A>enemy.
<A NAME="252"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 13</B>
<A NAME="253"></A><BR><BR>In the mean time daily skirmishes take place continually in view 
<A NAME="254"></A>of both camps; these were fought at the ford and pass of the morass. In 
<A NAME="255"></A>one of these contests the Germans, whom Caesar had brought over the Rhine, 
<A NAME="256"></A>to fight, intermixed with the horse, having resolutely crossed the marsh, 
<A NAME="257"></A>and slain the few who made resistance, and boldly pursued the rest, so 
<A NAME="258"></A>terrified them, that not only those who were attacked hand to hand, or 
<A NAME="259"></A>wounded at a distance, but even those who were stationed at a greater distance 
<A NAME="260"></A>to support them, fled disgracefully; and being often beaten from the rising 
<A NAME="261"></A>grounds, did not stop till they had retired into their camp, or some, impelled 
<A NAME="262"></A>by fear, had fled further. Their danger threw their whole army into such 
<A NAME="263"></A>confusion, that it was difficult to judge whether they were more insolent 
<A NAME="264"></A>after a slight advantage or more dejected by a trifling 
<A NAME="265"></A>calamity.
<A NAME="266"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 14</B>
<A NAME="267"></A><BR><BR>After spending several days in the same camp, the guards of the 
<A NAME="268"></A>Bellovaci, learning that Caius Trebonius was advancing nearer with his 
<A NAME="269"></A>legions, and fearing a siege like that of Alesia, send off by night all 
<A NAME="270"></A>who were disabled by age or infirmity, or unarmed, and along with them 
<A NAME="271"></A>their whole baggage. While they are preparing their disorderly and confused 
<A NAME="272"></A>troop for march (for the Gauls are always attended by a vast multitude 
<A NAME="273"></A>of wagons, even when they have very light baggage), being overtaken by 
<A NAME="274"></A>day-light, they drew their forces out before their camp, to prevent the 
<A NAME="275"></A>Romans attempting a pursuit before the line of their baggage had advanced 
<A NAME="276"></A>to a considerable distance. But Caesar did not think it prudent to attack 
<A NAME="277"></A>them when standing on their defense, with such a steep hill in their favor, 
<A NAME="278"></A>nor keep his legions at such a distance that they could quit their post 
<A NAME="279"></A>without danger: but, perceiving that his camp was divided from the enemy's 
<A NAME="280"></A>by a deep morass, so difficult to cross that he could not pursue with expedition, 
<A NAME="281"></A>and that the hill beyond the morass, which extended almost to the enemy's 
<A NAME="282"></A>camp, was separated from it only by a small valley, he laid a bridge over 
<A NAME="283"></A>the morass and led his army across, and soon reached the plain on the top 
<A NAME="284"></A>of the hill, which was fortified on either side by a steep ascent. Having 
<A NAME="285"></A>there drawn up his army in order of battle, he marched to the furthest 
<A NAME="286"></A>hill, from which he could, with his engines, shower darts upon the thickest 
<A NAME="287"></A>of the enemy.
<A NAME="288"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 15</B>
<A NAME="289"></A><BR><BR>The Gauls, confiding in the natural strength of their position, 
<A NAME="290"></A>though they would not decline an engagement if the Romans attempted to 
<A NAME="291"></A>ascend the hill, yet dared not divide their forces into small parties, 
<A NAME="292"></A>lest they should be thrown into disorder by being dispersed, and therefore 
<A NAME="293"></A>remained in order of battle. Caesar, perceiving that they persisted in 
<A NAME="294"></A>their resolution, kept twenty cohorts in battle array, and, measuring out 
<A NAME="295"></A>ground there for a camp, ordered it to be fortified. Having completed his 
<A NAME="296"></A>works, he drew up his legions before the rampart and stationed the cavalry 
<A NAME="297"></A>in certain positions, with their horses bridled. When the Bellovaci saw 
<A NAME="298"></A>the Romans prepared to pursue them, and that they could not wait the whole 
<A NAME="299"></A>night, or continue longer in the same place without provisions, they formed 
<A NAME="300"></A>the following plan to secure a retreat. They handed to one another the 
<A NAME="301"></A>bundles of straw and sticks on which they sat (for it is the custom of 
<A NAME="302"></A>the Gauls to sit when drawn up in order of battle, as has been asserted 
<A NAME="303"></A>in former commentaries), of which they had great plenty in their camp, 
<A NAME="304"></A>and piled them in the front of their line; and at the close of the day, 
<A NAME="305"></A>on a certain signal, set them all on fire at one and the same time. The 
<A NAME="306"></A>continued blaze soon screened all their forces from the sight of the Romans, 
<A NAME="307"></A>which no sooner happened than the barbarians fled with the greatest 
<A NAME="308"></A>precipitation.
<A NAME="309"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 16</B>
<A NAME="310"></A><BR><BR>Though Caesar could not perceive the retreat of the enemy for the 
<A NAME="311"></A>intervention of the fire, yet, suspecting that they had adopted that method 
<A NAME="312"></A>to favor their escape, he made his legions advance, and sent a party of 
<A NAME="313"></A>horse to pursue them; but, apprehensive of an ambuscade, and that the enemy 
<A NAME="314"></A>might remain in the same place and endeavor to draw our men into a disadvantageous 
<A NAME="315"></A>situation, he advances himself but slowly. The horse, being afraid to venture 
<A NAME="316"></A>into the smoke and dense line of flame, and those who were bold enough 
<A NAME="317"></A>to attempt it being scarcely able to see their horse's heads, gave the 
<A NAME="318"></A>enemy free liberty to retreat, through fear of an ambuscade. Thus by a 
<A NAME="319"></A>flight, full at once of cowardice and address, they advanced without any 
<A NAME="320"></A>loss about ten miles, and encamped in a very strong position. From which, 
<A NAME="321"></A>laying numerous ambuscades, both of horse and foot, they did considerable 
<A NAME="322"></A>damage to the Roman foragers.
<A NAME="323"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 17</B>
<A NAME="324"></A><BR><BR>After this had happened several times, Caesar discovered from a 
<A NAME="325"></A>certain prisoner, that Correus, the general of the Bellovaci, had selected 
<A NAME="326"></A>six thousand of his bravest foot and a thousand horse, with which he designed 
<A NAME="327"></A>to lie in ambush in a place to which he suspected the Romans would send 
<A NAME="328"></A>to look for forage, on account of the abundance of corn and grass. Upon 
<A NAME="329"></A>receiving information of their design Caesar drew out more legions than 
<A NAME="330"></A>he usually did, and sent forward his cavalry as usual, to protect the foragers. 
<A NAME="331"></A>With these he intermixed a guard of light infantry, and himself advanced 
<A NAME="332"></A>with the legions as fast as he could.
<A NAME="333"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 18</B>
<A NAME="334"></A><BR><BR>The Gauls, placed in ambush, had chosen for the seat of action 
<A NAME="335"></A>a level piece of ground, not more than a mile in extent, inclosed on every 
<A NAME="336"></A>side by a thick wood or a very deep river, as by a toil, and this they 
<A NAME="337"></A>surrounded. Our men, apprised of the enemy's design, marched in good order 
<A NAME="338"></A>to the ground, ready both in heart and hand to give battle, and willing 
<A NAME="339"></A>to hazard any engagement when the legions were at their back. On their 
<A NAME="340"></A>approach, as Correus supposed that he had got an opportunity of effecting 
<A NAME="341"></A>his purpose, he at first shows himself with a small party and attacks the 
<A NAME="342"></A>foremost troops. Our men resolutely stood the charge, and did not crowd 
<A NAME="343"></A>together in one place, as commonly happens from surprise in engagements 
<A NAME="344"></A>between the horse, whose numbers prove injurious to 
<A NAME="345"></A>themselves.
<A NAME="346"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 19</B>
<A NAME="347"></A><BR><BR>When by the judicious arrangement of our forces only a few of our 
<A NAME="348"></A>men fought by turns, and did not suffer themselves to be surrounded, the 
<A NAME="349"></A>rest of the enemy broke out from the woods while Correus was engaged. The 
<A NAME="350"></A>battle was maintained in different parts with great vigor, and continued 
<A NAME="351"></A>for a long time undecided, till at length a body of foot gradually advanced 
<A NAME="352"></A>from the woods in order of battle and forced our horse to give ground: 
<A NAME="353"></A>the light infantry, which were sent before the legions to the assistance 
<A NAME="354"></A>of the cavalry, soon came up, and, mixing with the horse, fought with great 
<A NAME="355"></A>courage. The battle was for some time doubtful, but, as usually happens, 
<A NAME="356"></A>our men, who stood the enemy's first charge, became superior from this 
<A NAME="357"></A>very circumstance that, though suddenly attacked from an ambuscade, they 
<A NAME="358"></A>had sustained no loss. In the mean time the legions were approaching, and 
<A NAME="359"></A>several messengers arrived with notice to our men and the enemy that the 
<A NAME="360"></A>[Roman] general was near at hand, with his forces in battle array. Upon 
<A NAME="361"></A>this intelligence, our men, confiding in the support of the cohorts, fought 
<A NAME="362"></A>most resolutely, fearing, lest if they should be slow in their operations 
<A NAME="363"></A>they should let the legions participate in the glory of the conquest. The 
<A NAME="364"></A>enemy lose courage and attempt to escape by different ways. In vain; for 
<A NAME="365"></A>they were themselves entangled in that labyrinth in which they thought 
<A NAME="366"></A>to entrap the Romans. Being defeated and put to the rout, and having lost 
<A NAME="367"></A>the greater part of their men, they fled in consternation whithersoever 
<A NAME="368"></A>chance carried them; some sought the woods, others the river, but were 
<A NAME="369"></A>vigorously pursued by our men and put to the sword. Yet, in the mean time, 
<A NAME="370"></A>Correus, unconquered by calamity, could not be prevailed on to quit the 
<A NAME="371"></A>field and take refuge in the woods, or accept our offers of quarter, but, 
<A NAME="372"></A>fighting courageously and wounding several, provoked our men, elated with 
<A NAME="373"></A>victory, to discharge their weapons against him.
<A NAME="374"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 20</B>
<A NAME="375"></A><BR><BR>After this transaction, Caesar, having come up immediately after 
<A NAME="376"></A>the battle, and imagining that the enemy, upon receiving the news of so 
<A NAME="377"></A>great a defeat, would be so depressed that they would abandon their camp, 
<A NAME="378"></A>which was not above eight miles distant from the scene of action, though 
<A NAME="379"></A>he saw his passage obstructed by the river, yet he marched his army over 
<A NAME="380"></A>and advanced. But the Bellovaci and the other states, being informed of 
<A NAME="381"></A>the loss they had sustained by a few wounded men who having escaped by 
<A NAME="382"></A>the shelter of the woods, had returned to them after the defeat, and learning 
<A NAME="383"></A>that every thing had turned out unfavorable, that Correus was slain, and 
<A NAME="384"></A>the horse and most valiant of their foot cut off, imagined that the Romans 
<A NAME="385"></A>were marching against them, and calling a council in haste by sound of 
<A NAME="386"></A>trumpet, unanimously cry out to send embassadors and hostages to 
<A NAME="387"></A>Caesar.
<A NAME="388"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 21</B>
<A NAME="389"></A><BR><BR>This proposal having met with general approbation, Comius the Atrebatian 
<A NAME="390"></A>fled to those Germans from whom he had borrowed auxiliaries for that war. 
<A NAME="391"></A>The rest instantly send embassadors to Caesar; and requested that he would 
<A NAME="392"></A>be contented with that punishment of his enemy, which if he had possessed 
<A NAME="393"></A>the power to inflict on them before the engagement, when they were yet 
<A NAME="394"></A>uninjured, they were persuaded from his usual clemency and mercy, he never 
<A NAME="395"></A>would have inflicted; that the power of the Bellovaci was crushed by the 
<A NAME="396"></A>cavalry action; that many thousand of their choicest foot had fallen, that 
<A NAME="397"></A>scarce a man had escaped to bring the fatal news. That, however, the Bellovaci 
<A NAME="398"></A>had derived from the battle one advantage, of some importance, considering 
<A NAME="399"></A>their loss; that Correus, the author of the rebellion, and agitator of 
<A NAME="400"></A>the people, was slain: for that while he lived the senate had never equal 
<A NAME="401"></A>influence in the state with the giddy populace.
<A NAME="402"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 22</B>
<A NAME="403"></A><BR><BR>Caesar reminded the embassadors who made these supplications, that 
<A NAME="404"></A>the Bellovaci had at the same season the year before, in conjunction with 
<A NAME="405"></A>other states of Gaul, undertaken a war, and that they had persevered the 
<A NAME="406"></A>most obstinately of all in their purpose, and were not brought to a proper 
<A NAME="407"></A>way of thinking by the submission of the rest: that he knew and was aware 
<A NAME="408"></A>that the guilt of a crime was easily transferred to the dead; but that 
<A NAME="409"></A>no one person could have such influence, as to be able by the feeble support 
<A NAME="410"></A>of the multitude to raise a war and carry it on without the consent of 
<A NAME="411"></A>the nobles, in opposition to the senate, and in despite of every virtuous 
<A NAME="412"></A>man; however he was satisfied with the punishment, which they had drawn 
<A NAME="413"></A>upon themselves.
<A NAME="414"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 23</B>
<A NAME="415"></A><BR><BR>The night following the embassadors bring back his answer to their 
<A NAME="416"></A>countrymen and prepare the hostages. Embassadors flock in from the other 
<A NAME="417"></A>states, which were waiting for the issue of the [war with the] Bellovaci: 
<A NAME="418"></A>they give hostages, and receive his orders; all except Comius, whose fears 
<A NAME="419"></A>restrained him from intrusting his safety to any person's honor. For the 
<A NAME="420"></A>year before, while Caesar was holding the assizes in Hither Gaul, Titus 
<A NAME="421"></A>Labienus, having discovered that Comius was tampering with the state, and 
<A NAME="422"></A>raising a conspiracy against Caesar, thought he might punish his infidelity 
<A NAME="423"></A>without perfidy; but judging that he would not come to his camp at his 
<A NAME="424"></A>invitation, and unwilling to put him on his guard by the attempt, he sent 
<A NAME="425"></A>Caius Volusenus Quadratus, with orders to have him put to death under pretense 
<A NAME="426"></A>of conference. To effect his purpose, he sent with him some chosen centurions. 
<A NAME="427"></A>When they came to the conference, and Volusenus, as had been agreed on, 
<A NAME="428"></A>had taken hold of Comius by the hand, and one of the centurions, as if 
<A NAME="429"></A>surprised at so uncommon an incident, attempted to kill him, he was prevented 
<A NAME="430"></A>by the friends of Comius, but wounded him severely in the head by the first 
<A NAME="431"></A>blow. Swords were drawn on both sides, not so much with a design to fight 
<A NAME="432"></A>as to effect an escape, our men believing that Comius had received a mortal 
<A NAME="433"></A>stroke; and the Gauls, from the treachery which they had seen, dreading 
<A NAME="434"></A>that a deeper design lay concealed. Upon this transaction, it was said 
<A NAME="435"></A>that Comius made a resolution never to come within sight of any 
<A NAME="436"></A>Roman.
<A NAME="437"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 24</B>
<A NAME="438"></A><BR><BR>When Caesar, having completely conquered the most warlike nations, 
<A NAME="439"></A>perceived that there was now no state which could make preparations for 
<A NAME="440"></A>war to oppose him, but that some were removing and fleeing from their country 
<A NAME="441"></A>to avoid present subjection, he resolved to detach his army into different 
<A NAME="442"></A>parts of the country. He kept with himself Marcus Antonius the quaestor, 
<A NAME="443"></A>with the eleventh legion; Caius Fabius was detached with twenty-five cohorts 
<A NAME="444"></A>into the remotest part of Gaul, because it was rumored that some states 
<A NAME="445"></A>had risen in arms, and he did not think that Caius Caninius Rebilus, who 
<A NAME="446"></A>had the charge of that country, was strong enough to protect it with two 
<A NAME="447"></A>legions. He ordered Titus Labienus to attend himself, and sent the twelfth 
<A NAME="448"></A>legion which had been under him in winter quarters, to Hither Gaul, to 
<A NAME="449"></A>protect the Roman colonies, and prevent any loss by the inroads of barbarians 
<A NAME="450"></A>similar to that which had happened the year before to the Tergestines, 
<A NAME="451"></A>who were cut off by a sudden depredation and attack. He himself marched 
<A NAME="452"></A>to depopulate the country of Ambiorix, whom he had terrified and forced 
<A NAME="453"></A>to fly, but despaired of being able to reduce under his power; but he thought 
<A NAME="454"></A>it most consistent with his honor to waste his country both of inhabitants, 
<A NAME="455"></A>cattle, and buildings, so that from the abhorrence of his countrymen, if 
<A NAME="456"></A>fortune suffered any to survive, he might be excluded from a return to 
<A NAME="457"></A>his state for the calamities which he had brought on 
<A NAME="458"></A>it.
<A NAME="459"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 25</B>
<A NAME="460"></A><BR><BR>After he had sent either his legions or auxiliaries through every 
<A NAME="461"></A>part of Ambiorix's dominions, and wasted the whole country by sword, fire, 
<A NAME="462"></A>and rapine, and had killed or taken prodigious numbers, he sent Labienus 
<A NAME="463"></A>with two legions against the Treviri, whose state, from its vicinity to 
<A NAME="464"></A>Germany, being engaged in constant war, differed but little from the Germans, 
<A NAME="465"></A>in civilization and savage barbarity; and never continued in its allegiance, 
<A NAME="466"></A>except when awed by the presence of his army.
<A NAME="467"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 26</B>
<A NAME="468"></A><BR><BR>In the mean time Caius Caninius, a lieutenant, having received 
<A NAME="469"></A>information by letters and messages from Duracius, who had always continued 
<A NAME="470"></A>in friendship to the Roman people, though a part of his state had revolted, 
<A NAME="471"></A>that a great multitude of the enemy were in arms in the country of the 
<A NAME="472"></A>Pictones, marched to the town Limonum. When he was approaching it, he was 
<A NAME="473"></A>informed by some prisoners, that Duracius was shut up by several thousand 
<A NAME="474"></A>men, under the command of Dumnacus, general of the Andes, and that Limonum 
<A NAME="475"></A>was besieged, but not daring to face the enemy with his weak legions, he 
<A NAME="476"></A>encamped in a strong position: Dumnacus, having notice of Caninius's approach, 
<A NAME="477"></A>turned his whole force against the legions, and prepared to assault the 
<A NAME="478"></A>Roman camp. But after spending several days in the attempt, and losing 
<A NAME="479"></A>a considerable number of men, without being able to make a breach in any 
<A NAME="480"></A>part of the works, he returned again to the siege of 
<A NAME="481"></A>Limonum.
<A NAME="482"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 27</B>
<A NAME="483"></A><BR><BR>At the same time, Caius Fabius, a lieutenant, brings back many 
<A NAME="484"></A>states to their allegiance, and confirms their submission by taking hostages; 
<A NAME="485"></A>he was then informed by letters from Caninius, of the proceedings among 
<A NAME="486"></A>the Pictones. Upon which he set off to bring assistance to Duracius. But 
<A NAME="487"></A>Dumnacus, hearing of the approach of Fabius, and despairing of safety, 
<A NAME="488"></A>if at the same time he should be forced to withstand the Roman army without, 
<A NAME="489"></A>and observe, and be under apprehension from the town's people, made a precipitate 
<A NAME="490"></A>retreat from that place with all his forces. Nor did he think that he should 
<A NAME="491"></A>be sufficiently secure from danger, unless he led his army across the Loire, 
<A NAME="492"></A>which was too deep a river to pass except by a bridge. Though Fabius had 
<A NAME="493"></A>not yet come within sight of the enemy, nor joined Caninius; yet being 
<A NAME="494"></A>informed of the nature of the country, by persons acquainted with it, he 
<A NAME="495"></A>judged it most likely that the enemy would take that way, which he found 
<A NAME="496"></A>they did take. He therefore marched to that bridge with his army, and ordered 
<A NAME="497"></A>his cavalry to advance no farther before the legions than that they could 
<A NAME="498"></A>return to the same camp at night, without fatiguing their horses. Our horse 
<A NAME="499"></A>pursued according to orders, and fell upon Dumnacus's rear and attacking 
<A NAME="500"></A>them on their march, while fleeing, dismayed, and laden with baggage, they 
<A NAME="501"></A>slew a great number, and took a rich booty. Having executed the affair 
<A NAME="502"></A>so successfully, they retired to the camp.
<A NAME="503"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 28</B>
<A NAME="504"></A><BR><BR>The night following, Fabius sent his horse before him, with orders 
<A NAME="505"></A>to engage the enemy, and delay their march till he himself should come 
<A NAME="506"></A>up. That his orders might be faithfully performed, Quintus Atius Varus, 
<A NAME="507"></A>general of the horse, a man of uncommon spirit and skill, encouraged his 
<A NAME="508"></A>men, and pursuing the enemy, disposed some of his troops in convenient 
<A NAME="509"></A>places, and with the rest gave battle to the enemy. The enemy's cavalry 
<A NAME="510"></A>made a bold stand, the foot relieving each other, and making a general 
<A NAME="511"></A>halt, to assist their horse against ours. The battle was warmly contested. 
<A NAME="512"></A>For our men, despising the enemy whom they had conquered the day before, 
<A NAME="513"></A>and knowing that the legions were following them, animated both by the 
<A NAME="514"></A>disgrace of retreating, and a desire of concluding the battle expeditiously 
<A NAME="515"></A>by their own courage, fought most valiantly against the foot: and the enemy, 
<A NAME="516"></A>imagining that no more forces would come against them, as they had experienced 
<A NAME="517"></A>the day before, thought they had got a favorable opportunity of destroying 
<A NAME="518"></A>our whole cavalry.
<A NAME="519"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 29</B>
<A NAME="520"></A><BR><BR>After the conflict had continued for some time with great violence, 
<A NAME="521"></A>Dumnacus drew out his army in such a manner, that the foot should by turns 
<A NAME="522"></A>assist the horse. Then the legions, marching in close order, came suddenly 
<A NAME="523"></A>in sight of the enemy. At this sight, the barbarian horse were so astonished, 
<A NAME="524"></A>and the foot so terrified, that breaking through the line of baggage, they 
<A NAME="525"></A>betook themselves to flight with a loud shout, and in great disorder. But 
<A NAME="526"></A>our horse, who a little before had vigorously engaged them, while they 
<A NAME="527"></A>made resistance, being elated with joy at their victory, raising a shout 
<A NAME="528"></A>on every side, poured round them as they ran, and as long as their horses 
<A NAME="529"></A>had strength to pursue, or their arms to give a blow, so long did they 
<A NAME="530"></A>continue the slaughter of the enemy in that battle, and having killed above 
<A NAME="531"></A>twelve thousand men in arms, or such as threw away their arms through fear, 
<A NAME="532"></A>they took their whole train of baggage.
<A NAME="533"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 30</B>
<A NAME="534"></A><BR><BR>After this defeat, when it was ascertained that Drapes, a Senonian 
<A NAME="535"></A>(who in the beginning of the revolt of Gaul had collected from all quarters 
<A NAME="536"></A>men of desperate fortunes, invited the slaves to liberty, called in the 
<A NAME="537"></A>exiles of the whole kingdom, given an asylum to robbers, and intercepted 
<A NAME="538"></A>the Roman baggage and provisions), was marching to the province with five 
<A NAME="539"></A>thousand men, being all he could collect after the defeat, and that Luterius 
<A NAME="540"></A>a Cadurcian who, as it has been observed in a former commentary, had designed 
<A NAME="541"></A>to make an attack on the Province in the first revolt of Gaul, had formed 
<A NAME="542"></A>a junction with him, Caius Caninius went in pursuit of them with two legions, 
<A NAME="543"></A>lest great disgrace might be incurred from the fears or injuries done to 
<A NAME="544"></A>the Province by the depredations of a band of desperate 
<A NAME="545"></A>men.
<A NAME="546"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 31</B>
<A NAME="547"></A><BR><BR>Caius Fabius set off with the rest of the army to the Carnutes 
<A NAME="548"></A>and those other states, whose force he was informed, had served as auxiliaries 
<A NAME="549"></A>in that battle, which he fought against Dumnacus. For he had no doubt that 
<A NAME="550"></A>they would be more submissive after their recent sufferings, but if respite 
<A NAME="551"></A>and time were given them, they might be easily excited by the earnest solicitations 
<A NAME="552"></A>of the same Dumnacus. On this occasion Fabius was extremely fortunate and 
<A NAME="553"></A>expeditious in recovering the states. For the Carnutes, who, though often 
<A NAME="554"></A>harassed had never mentioned peace, submitted and gave hostages: and the 
<A NAME="555"></A>other states, which lie in the remotest parts of Gaul, adjoining the ocean, 
<A NAME="556"></A>and which are called Armoricae, influenced by the example of the Carnutes, 
<A NAME="557"></A>as soon as Fabius arrived with his legions, without delay comply with his 
<A NAME="558"></A>command. Dumnacus, expelled from his own territories, wandering and skulking 
<A NAME="559"></A>about, was forced to seek refuge by himself in the most remote parts of 
<A NAME="560"></A>Gaul.
<A NAME="561"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 32</B>
<A NAME="562"></A><BR><BR>But Drapes in conjunction with Luterius, knowing that Caninius 
<A NAME="563"></A>was at hand with the legions, and that they themselves could not without 
<A NAME="564"></A>certain destruction enter the boundaries of the province, while an army 
<A NAME="565"></A>was in pursuit of them, and being no longer at liberty to roam up and down 
<A NAME="566"></A>and pillage, halt in the country of the Cadurci, as Luterius had once in 
<A NAME="567"></A>his prosperity possessed a powerful influence over the inhabitants, who 
<A NAME="568"></A>were his countrymen, and being always the author of new projects, had considerable 
<A NAME="569"></A>authority among the barbarians; with his own and Drapes' troops he seized 
<A NAME="570"></A>Uxellodunum, a town formerly in vassalage to him, and strongly fortified 
<A NAME="571"></A>by its natural situation; and prevailed on the inhabitants to join 
<A NAME="572"></A>him.
<A NAME="573"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 33</B>
<A NAME="574"></A><BR><BR>After Caninius had rapidly marched to this place, and perceived 
<A NAME="575"></A>that all parts of the town were secured by very craggy rocks, which it 
<A NAME="576"></A>would be difficult for men in arms to climb even if they met with no resistance; 
<A NAME="577"></A>and moreover, observing that the town's people were possessed of effects, 
<A NAME="578"></A>to a considerable amount, and that if they attempted to convey them away 
<A NAME="579"></A>in a clandestine manner, they could not escape our horse, or even our legions; 
<A NAME="580"></A>he divided his forces into three parts, and pitched three camps on very 
<A NAME="581"></A>high ground, with the intention of drawing lines round the town by degrees, 
<A NAME="582"></A>as his forces could bear the fatigue.
<A NAME="583"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 34</B>
<A NAME="584"></A><BR><BR>When the townsmen perceived his design, being terrified by the 
<A NAME="585"></A>recollection of the distress at Alesia, they began to dread similar consequences 
<A NAME="586"></A>from a siege; and above all Luterius, who had experienced that fatal event, 
<A NAME="587"></A>cautioned them to make provisions of corn; they therefore resolve by general 
<A NAME="588"></A>consent to leave part of their troops behind, and set out with their light 
<A NAME="589"></A>troops to bring in corn. The scheme having met with approbation, the following 
<A NAME="590"></A>night Drapes and Luterius leaving two thousand men in the garrison, marched 
<A NAME="591"></A>out of the town with the rest. After a few days' stay in the country of 
<A NAME="592"></A>the Cadurci (some of whom were disposed to assist them with corn, and others 
<A NAME="593"></A>were unable to prevent their taking it) they collected a great store. Sometimes 
<A NAME="594"></A>also attacks were made on our little forts by sallies at night. For this 
<A NAME="595"></A>reason Caninius deferred drawing his works round the whole town, lest he 
<A NAME="596"></A>should be unable to protect them when completed, or by disposing his garrisons 
<A NAME="597"></A>in several places, should make them too weak.
<A NAME="598"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 35</B>
<A NAME="599"></A><BR><BR>Drapes and Luterius, having laid in a large supply of corn, occupying 
<A NAME="600"></A>a position at about ten miles distance from the town, intending from it 
<A NAME="601"></A>to convey the corn into the town by degrees. They chose each his respective 
<A NAME="602"></A>department. Drapes stayed behind in the camp with part of the army to protect 
<A NAME="603"></A>it; Luterius conveys the train with provisions into the town. Accordingly, 
<A NAME="604"></A>having disposed guards here and there along the road, about the tenth hour 
<A NAME="605"></A>of the night, he set out by narrow paths through the woods, to fetch the 
<A NAME="606"></A>corn into the town. But their noise being heard by the sentinels of our 
<A NAME="607"></A>camp, and the scouts which we had sent out, having brought an account of 
<A NAME="608"></A>what was going on, Caninius instantly with the ready-armed cohorts from 
<A NAME="609"></A>the nearest turrets made an attack on the convoy at the break of day. They, 
<A NAME="610"></A>alarmed at so unexpected an evil, fled by different ways to their guard: 
<A NAME="611"></A>which as soon as our men perceived, they fell with great fury on the escort, 
<A NAME="612"></A>and did not allow a single man to be taken alive. Luterius escaped thence 
<A NAME="613"></A>with a few followers, but did not return to the camp.
<A NAME="614"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 36</B>
<A NAME="615"></A><BR><BR>After this success, Caninius learned from some prisoners, that 
<A NAME="616"></A>a part of the forces was encamped with Drapes, not more than ten miles 
<A NAME="617"></A>off: which being confirmed by several, supposing that after the defeat 
<A NAME="618"></A>of one general, the rest would be terrified, and might be easily conquered, 
<A NAME="619"></A>he thought it a most fortunate event that none of the enemy had fled back 
<A NAME="620"></A>from the slaughter to the camp, to give Drapes notice of the calamity which 
<A NAME="621"></A>had befallen him. And as he could see no danger in making the attempt, 
<A NAME="622"></A>he sent forward all his cavalry and the German foot, men of great activity, 
<A NAME="623"></A>to the enemy's camp. He divides one legion among the three camps, and takes 
<A NAME="624"></A>the other without baggage along with him. When he had advanced near the 
<A NAME="625"></A>enemy, he was informed by scouts, which he had sent before him, that the 
<A NAME="626"></A>enemy's camp, as is the custom of barbarians, was pitched low, near the 
<A NAME="627"></A>banks of a river, and that the higher grounds were unoccupied: but that 
<A NAME="628"></A>the German horse had made a sudden attack on them, and had begun the battle. 
<A NAME="629"></A>Upon this intelligence, he marched up with his legion, armed and in order 
<A NAME="630"></A>of battle. Then, on a signal being suddenly given on every side, our men 
<A NAME="631"></A>took possession of the higher grounds. Upon this the German horse observing 
<A NAME="632"></A>the Roman colors, fought with great vigor. Immediately all the cohorts 
<A NAME="633"></A>attack them on every side; and having either killed or made prisoners of 
<A NAME="634"></A>them all, gained great booty. In that battle, Drapes himself was taken 
<A NAME="635"></A>prisoner.
<A NAME="636"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 37</B>
<A NAME="637"></A><BR><BR>Caninius, having accomplished the business so successfully, without 
<A NAME="638"></A>having scarcely a man wounded, returned to besiege the town; and, having 
<A NAME="639"></A>destroyed the enemy without, for fear of whom he had been prevented from 
<A NAME="640"></A>strengthening his redoubts, and surrounding the enemy with his lines, he 
<A NAME="641"></A>orders the work to be completed on every side. The next day, Caius Fabius 
<A NAME="642"></A>came to join him with his forces, and took upon him the siege of one 
<A NAME="643"></A>side.
<A NAME="644"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 38</B>
<A NAME="645"></A><BR><BR>In the mean time, Caesar left Caius Antonius in the country of 
<A NAME="646"></A>the Bellovaci, with fifteen cohorts, that the Belgae might have no opportunity 
<A NAME="647"></A>of forming new plans in future. He himself visits the other states, demands 
<A NAME="648"></A>a great number of hostages, and by his encouraging language allays the 
<A NAME="649"></A>apprehensions of all. When he came to the Carnutes, in whose state he has 
<A NAME="650"></A>in a former commentary mentioned that the war first broke out; observing, 
<A NAME="651"></A>that from a consciousness of their guilt, they seemed to be in the greatest 
<A NAME="652"></A>terror: to relieve the state the sooner from its fear, he demanded that 
<A NAME="653"></A>Guturvatus, the promoter of that treason, and the instigator of that rebellion, 
<A NAME="654"></A>should be delivered up to punishment. And though the latter did not dare 
<A NAME="655"></A>to trust his life even to his own countrymen, yet such diligent search 
<A NAME="656"></A>was made by them all, that he was soon brought to our camp. Caesar was 
<A NAME="657"></A>forced to punish him, by the clamors of the soldiers, contrary to his natural 
<A NAME="658"></A>humanity, for they alleged that all the dangers and losses incurred in 
<A NAME="659"></A>that war, ought to be imputed to Guturvatus. Accordingly, he was whipped 
<A NAME="660"></A>to death, and his head cut off.
<A NAME="661"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 39</B>
<A NAME="662"></A><BR><BR>Here Caesar was informed by numerous letters from Caninius of what 
<A NAME="663"></A>had happened to Drapes and Luterius, and in what conduct the town's people 
<A NAME="664"></A>persisted: and though he despised the smallness of their numbers, yet he 
<A NAME="665"></A>thought their obstinacy deserving a severe punishment, lest Gaul in general 
<A NAME="666"></A>should adopt an idea that she did not want strength but perseverance to 
<A NAME="667"></A>oppose the Romans; and lest the other states, relying on the advantage 
<A NAME="668"></A>of situation, should follow their example and assert their liberty; especially 
<A NAME="669"></A>as he knew that all the Gauls understood that his command was to continue 
<A NAME="670"></A>but one summer longer, and if they could hold out for that time, that they 
<A NAME="671"></A>would have no further danger to apprehend. He therefore left Quintus Calenus, 
<A NAME="672"></A>one of his lieutenants, behind him, with two legions, and instructions 
<A NAME="673"></A>to follow him by regular marches. He hastened as much as he could with 
<A NAME="674"></A>all the cavalry to Caninius.
<A NAME="675"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 40</B>
<A NAME="676"></A><BR><BR>Having arrived at Uxellodunum, contrary to the general expectation, 
<A NAME="677"></A>and perceiving that the town was surrounded by the works, and that the 
<A NAME="678"></A>enemy had no possible means of retiring from the assault, and being likewise 
<A NAME="679"></A>informed by the deserters that the townsmen had abundance of corn, he endeavoured 
<A NAME="680"></A>to prevent their getting water. A river divided the valley below, which 
<A NAME="681"></A>almost surrounded the steep craggy mountain on which Uxellodunum was built. 
<A NAME="682"></A>The nature of the ground prevented his turning the current: for it ran 
<A NAME="683"></A>so low down at the foot of the mountain, that no drains could be sunk deep 
<A NAME="684"></A>enough to draw it off in any direction. But the descent to it was so difficult, 
<A NAME="685"></A>that if we made opposition, the besieged could neither come to the river 
<A NAME="686"></A>nor retire up the precipice without hazard of their lives. Caesar perceiving 
<A NAME="687"></A>the difficulty, disposed archers and slingers, and in some places, opposite 
<A NAME="688"></A>to the easiest descents, placed engines, and attempted to hinder the townsmen 
<A NAME="689"></A>from getting water at the river, which obliged them afterward to go all 
<A NAME="690"></A>to one place to procure water.
<A NAME="691"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 41</B>
<A NAME="692"></A><BR><BR>Close under the walls of the town, a copious spring gushed out 
<A NAME="693"></A>on that part, which for the space of nearly three hundred feet, was not 
<A NAME="694"></A>surrounded by the river. While every other person wished that the besieged 
<A NAME="695"></A>could be debarred from this spring, Caesar alone saw that it could be effected, 
<A NAME="696"></A>though not without great danger. Opposite to it he began to advance the 
<A NAME="697"></A>vineae toward the mountain, and to throw up a mound, with great labor and 
<A NAME="698"></A>continual skirmishing. For the townsmen ran down from the high ground, 
<A NAME="699"></A>and fought without any risk, and wounded several of our men, yet they obstinately 
<A NAME="700"></A>pushed on and were not deterred from moving forward the vineae, and from 
<A NAME="701"></A>surmounting by their assiduity the difficulties of situation. At the same 
<A NAME="702"></A>time they work mines, and move the crates and vineae to the source of the 
<A NAME="703"></A>fountain. This was the only work which they could do without danger or 
<A NAME="704"></A>suspicion. A mound sixty feet high was raised; on it was erected a turret 
<A NAME="705"></A>of ten stories, not with the intention that it should be on a level with 
<A NAME="706"></A>the wall (for that could not be effected by any works), but to rise above 
<A NAME="707"></A>the top of the spring. When our engines began to play from it upon the 
<A NAME="708"></A>paths that led to the fountain, and the townsmen could not go for water 
<A NAME="709"></A>without danger, not only the cattle designed for food and the working cattle, 
<A NAME="710"></A>but a great number of men also died of thirst.
<A NAME="711"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 42</B>
<A NAME="712"></A><BR><BR>Alarmed at this calamity, the townsmen fill barrels with tallow, 
<A NAME="713"></A>pitch, and dried wood: these they set on fire, and roll down on our works. 
<A NAME="714"></A>At the same time, they fight most furiously, to deter the Romans, by the 
<A NAME="715"></A>engagement and danger, from extinguishing the flames. Instantly a great 
<A NAME="716"></A>blaze arose in the works. For whatever they threw down the precipice, striking 
<A NAME="717"></A>against the vineae and agger, communicated the fire to whatever was in 
<A NAME="718"></A>the way. Our soldiers on the other hand, though they were engaged in a 
<A NAME="719"></A>perilous sort of encounter, and laboring under the disadvantages of position, 
<A NAME="720"></A>yet supported all with very great presence of mind. For the action happened 
<A NAME="721"></A>in an elevated situation, and in sight of our army; and a great shout was 
<A NAME="722"></A>raised on both sides; therefore every man faced the weapons of the enemy 
<A NAME="723"></A>and the flames in as conspicuous a manner as he could, that his valor might 
<A NAME="724"></A>be the better known and attested.
<A NAME="725"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 43</B>
<A NAME="726"></A><BR><BR>Caesar, observing that several of his men were wounded, ordered 
<A NAME="727"></A>the cohorts to ascend the mountain on all sides, and, under pretense of 
<A NAME="728"></A>assailing the walls, to raise a shout: at which the besieged being frightened, 
<A NAME="729"></A>and not knowing what was going on in other places, call off their armed 
<A NAME="730"></A>troops from attacking our works, and dispose them on the walls. Thus our 
<A NAME="731"></A>men without hazarding a battle, gained time partly to extinguish the works 
<A NAME="732"></A>which had caught fire, and partly to cut off the communication. As the 
<A NAME="733"></A>townsmen still continued to make an obstinate resistance, and even, after 
<A NAME="734"></A>losing the greatest part of their forces by drought, persevered in their 
<A NAME="735"></A>resolution: at last the veins of the spring were cut across by our mines, 
<A NAME="736"></A>and turned from their course. By this their constant spring was suddenly 
<A NAME="737"></A>dried up, which reduced them to such despair that they imagined that it 
<A NAME="738"></A>was not done by the art of man, but the will of the gods; forced, therefore, 
<A NAME="739"></A>by necessity, they at length submitted.
<A NAME="740"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 44</B>
<A NAME="741"></A><BR><BR>Caesar, being convinced that his lenity was known to all men, and 
<A NAME="742"></A>being under no fears of being thought to act severely from a natural cruelty, 
<A NAME="743"></A>and perceiving that there would be no end to his troubles if several states 
<A NAME="744"></A>should attempt to rebel in like manner and in different places, resolved 
<A NAME="745"></A>to deter others by inflicting an exemplary punishment on these. Accordingly 
<A NAME="746"></A>he cut off the hands of those who had borne arms against him. Their lives 
<A NAME="747"></A>he spared, that the punishment of their rebellion might be the more conspicuous. 
<A NAME="748"></A>Drapes, who I have said was taken by Caninius, either through indignation 
<A NAME="749"></A>and grief arising from his captivity, or through fear of severer punishments, 
<A NAME="750"></A>abstained from food for several days, and thus perished. At the same time, 
<A NAME="751"></A>Luterius, who, I have related, had escaped from the battle, having fallen 
<A NAME="752"></A>into the hands of Epasnactus, an Arvernian (for he frequently changed his 
<A NAME="753"></A>quarters, and threw himself on the honor of several persons, as he saw 
<A NAME="754"></A>that he dare not remain long in one place, and was conscious how great 
<A NAME="755"></A>an enemy he deserved to have in Caesar), was by this Epasnactus, the Arvernian, 
<A NAME="756"></A>a sincere friend of the Roman people, delivered without any hesitation, 
<A NAME="757"></A>a prisoner to Caesar.
<A NAME="758"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 45</B>
<A NAME="759"></A><BR><BR>In the mean time, Labienus engages in a successful cavalry action 
<A NAME="760"></A>among the Treviri; and, having killed several of them and of the Germans, 
<A NAME="761"></A>who never refused their aid to any person against the Romans, he got their 
<A NAME="762"></A>chiefs alive into his power, and, among them, Surus, an Aeduan, who was 
<A NAME="763"></A>highly renowned both for his valor and birth, and was the only Aeduan that 
<A NAME="764"></A>had continued in arms till that time. Caesar, being informed of this, and 
<A NAME="765"></A>perceiving that he had met with good success in all parts of Gaul, and 
<A NAME="766"></A>reflecting that, in former campaigns [Celtic] Gaul had been conquered and 
<A NAME="767"></A>subdued; but that he had never gone in person to Aquitania, but had made 
<A NAME="768"></A>a conquest of it, in some degree, by Marcus Crassus, set out for it with 
<A NAME="769"></A>two legions, designing to spend the latter part of the summer there. This 
<A NAME="770"></A>affair he executed with his usual dispatch and good fortune. For all the 
<A NAME="771"></A>states of Aquitania sent embassadors to him and delivered hostages. These 
<A NAME="772"></A>affairs being concluded, he marched with a guard of cavalry toward Narbo, 
<A NAME="773"></A>and drew off his army into winter quarters by his lieutenants. He posted 
<A NAME="774"></A>four legions in the country of the Belgae, under Marcus Antonius, Caius 
<A NAME="775"></A>Trebonius, Publius Vatinius, and Quintus Tullius, his lieutenants. Two 
<A NAME="776"></A>he detached to the Aedui, knowing them to have a very powerful influence 
<A NAME="777"></A>throughout all Gaul. Two he placed among the Turoni, near the confines 
<A NAME="778"></A>of the Carnutes, to keep in awe the entire tract of country bordering on 
<A NAME="779"></A>the ocean; the other two he placed in the territories of the Lemovices, 
<A NAME="780"></A>at a small distance from the Arverni, that no part of Gaul might be without 
<A NAME="781"></A>an army. Having spent a few days in the province, he quickly ran through 
<A NAME="782"></A>all the business of the assizes, settled all public disputes, and distributed 
<A NAME="783"></A>rewards to the most deserving; for he had a good opportunity of learning 
<A NAME="784"></A>how every person was disposed toward the republic during the general revolt 
<A NAME="785"></A>of Gaul, which he had withstood by the fidelity and assistance of the 
<A NAME="786"></A>Province.
<A NAME="787"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 47</B>
<A NAME="788"></A><BR><BR>Having finished these affairs, he returned to his legions among 
<A NAME="789"></A>the Belgae and wintered at Nemetocenna: there he got intelligence that 
<A NAME="790"></A>Comius, the Atrebatian had had an engagement with his cavalry. For when 
<A NAME="791"></A>Antonius had gone into winter quarters, and the state of the Atrebates 
<A NAME="792"></A>continued in their allegiance, Comius, who, after that wound which I before 
<A NAME="793"></A>mentioned, was always ready to join his countrymen upon every commotion, 
<A NAME="794"></A>that they might not want a person to advise and head them in the management 
<A NAME="795"></A>of the war, when his state submitted to the Romans, supported himself and 
<A NAME="796"></A>his adherents on plunder by means of his cavalry, infested the roads, and 
<A NAME="797"></A>intercepted several convoys which were bringing provisions to the Roman 
<A NAME="798"></A>quarters.
<A NAME="799"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 48</B>
<A NAME="800"></A><BR><BR>Caius Volusenus Quadratus was appointed commander of the horse 
<A NAME="801"></A>under Antonius, to winter with him: Antonius sent him in pursuit of the 
<A NAME="802"></A>enemy's cavalry; now Volusenus added to that valor which was pre-eminent 
<A NAME="803"></A>in him, a great aversion to Comius, on which account he executed the more 
<A NAME="804"></A>willingly the orders which he received. Having, therefore, laid ambuscades, 
<A NAME="805"></A>he had several encounters with his cavalry and came off successful. At 
<A NAME="806"></A>last, when a violent contest ensued, and Volusenus, through eagerness to 
<A NAME="807"></A>intercept Comius, had obstinately pursued him with a small party; and Comius 
<A NAME="808"></A>had, by the rapidity of his flight, drawn Volusenus to a considerable distance 
<A NAME="809"></A>from his troops, he, on a sudden, appealed to the honor of all about him 
<A NAME="810"></A>for assistance not to suffer the wound, which he had perfidiously received, 
<A NAME="811"></A>to go without vengeance; and, wheeling his horse about, rode unguardedly 
<A NAME="812"></A>before the rest up to the commander. All his horse following his example, 
<A NAME="813"></A>made a few of our men turn their backs and pursued them. Comius, clapping 
<A NAME="814"></A>spurs to his horse, rode up to Volusenus, and, pointing his lance, pierced 
<A NAME="815"></A>him in the thigh with great force. When their commander was wounded, our 
<A NAME="816"></A>men no longer hesitated to make resistance, and, facing about, beat back 
<A NAME="817"></A>the enemy. When this occurred, several of the enemy, repulsed by the great 
<A NAME="818"></A>impetuosity of our men, were wounded, and some were trampled to death in 
<A NAME="819"></A>striving to escape, and some were made prisoners. Their general escaped 
<A NAME="820"></A>this misfortune by the swiftness of his horse. Our commander, being severely 
<A NAME="821"></A>wounded, so much so that he appeared to run the risk of losing his life, 
<A NAME="822"></A>was carried back to the camp. But Comius, having either gratified his resentment, 
<A NAME="823"></A>or, because he had lost the greatest part of his followers, sent embassadors 
<A NAME="824"></A>to Antonius, and assured him that he would give hostages as a security 
<A NAME="825"></A>that he would go wherever Antonius should prescribe, and would comply with 
<A NAME="826"></A>his orders, and only entreated that this concession should be made to his 
<A NAME="827"></A>fears, that he should not be obliged to go into the presence of any Roman. 
<A NAME="828"></A>As Antonius judged that his request originated in a just apprehension, 
<A NAME="829"></A>he indulged him in it and accepted his hostages.Caesar, I know, has made 
<A NAME="830"></A>a separate commentary of each year's transactions, which I have not thought 
<A NAME="831"></A>it necessary for me to do, because the following year, in which Lucius 
<A NAME="832"></A>Paulus and Caius Marcellus were consuls, produced no remarkable occurrences 
<A NAME="833"></A>in Gaul. But that no person may be left in ignorance of the place where 
<A NAME="834"></A>Caesar and his army were at that time, have thought proper to write a few 
<A NAME="835"></A>words in addition to this commentary.
<A NAME="836"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 49</B>
<A NAME="837"></A><BR><BR>Caesar, while in winter quarters in the country of the Belgae, 
<A NAME="838"></A>made it his only business to keep the states in amity with him, and to 
<A NAME="839"></A>give none either hopes of, or pretext for a revolt. For nothing was further 
<A NAME="840"></A>from his wishes than to be under the necessity of engaging in another war 
<A NAME="841"></A>at his departure; lest, when he was drawing his army out of the country, 
<A NAME="842"></A>any war should be left unfinished, which the Gauls would cheerfully undertake, 
<A NAME="843"></A>when there was no immediate danger. Therefore, by treating the states with 
<A NAME="844"></A>respect, making rich presents to the leading men, imposing no new burdens, 
<A NAME="845"></A>and making the terms of their subjection lighter, he easily kept Gaul (already 
<A NAME="846"></A>exhausted by so many unsuccessful battles) in obedience.
<A NAME="847"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 50</B>
<A NAME="848"></A><BR><BR>When the winter quarters were broken up he himself, contrary to 
<A NAME="849"></A>his usual practice, proceeded to Italy, by the longest possible stages, 
<A NAME="850"></A>in order to visit the free towns and colonies, that he might recommend 
<A NAME="851"></A>to them the petition of Marcus Antonius, his treasurer, for the priesthood. 
<A NAME="852"></A>For he exerted his interest both cheerfully in favor of a man strongly 
<A NAME="853"></A>attached to him, whom he had sent home before him to attend the election, 
<A NAME="854"></A>and zealously to oppose the faction and power of a few men, who, by rejecting 
<A NAME="855"></A>Marcus Antonius, wished to undermine Caesar's influence when going out 
<A NAME="856"></A>of office. Though Caesar heard on the road, before he reached Italy that 
<A NAME="857"></A>he was created augur, yet he thought himself in honor bound to visit the 
<A NAME="858"></A>free towns and colonies, to return them thanks for rendering such service 
<A NAME="859"></A>to Antonius by their presence in such great numbers [at the election], 
<A NAME="860"></A>and at the same time to recommend to them himself, and his honor in his 
<A NAME="861"></A>suit for the consulate the ensuing year. For his adversaries arrogantly 
<A NAME="862"></A>boasted that Lucius Lentulus and Caius Marcellus had been appointed consuls, 
<A NAME="863"></A>who would strip Caesar of all honor and dignity: and that the consulate 
<A NAME="864"></A>had been injuriously taken from Sergius Galba, though he had been much 
<A NAME="865"></A>superior in votes and interest, because he was united to Caesar, both by 
<A NAME="866"></A>friendship, and by serving as lieutenant under him.
<A NAME="867"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 51</B>
<A NAME="868"></A><BR><BR>Caesar, on his arrival, was received by the principal towns and 
<A NAME="869"></A>colonies with incredible respect and affection; for this was the first 
<A NAME="870"></A>time he came since the war against united Gaul. Nothing was omitted which 
<A NAME="871"></A>could be thought of for the ornament of the gates, roads, and every place 
<A NAME="872"></A>through which Caesar was to pass. All the people with their children went 
<A NAME="873"></A>out to meet him. Sacrifices were offered up in every quarter. The market 
<A NAME="874"></A>places and temples were laid out with entertainments, as if anticipating 
<A NAME="875"></A>the joy of a most splendid triumph. So great was the magnificence of the 
<A NAME="876"></A>richer and zeal of the poorer ranks of the people.
<A NAME="877"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 52</B>
<A NAME="878"></A><BR><BR>When Caesar had gone through all the states of Cisalpine Gaul, 
<A NAME="879"></A>he returned with the greatest haste to the army at Nemetocenna; and having 
<A NAME="880"></A>ordered all his legions to march from winter quarters to the territories 
<A NAME="881"></A>of the Treviri, he went thither and reviewed them. He made Titus Labienus 
<A NAME="882"></A>governor of Cisalpine Gaul, that he might be the more inclined to support 
<A NAME="883"></A>him in his suit for the consulate. He himself made such journeys as he 
<A NAME="884"></A>thought would conduce to the health of his men by change of air; and though 
<A NAME="885"></A>he was frequently told that Labienus was solicited by his enemies, and 
<A NAME="886"></A>was assured that a scheme was in agitation by the contrivance of a few, 
<A NAME="887"></A>that the senate should interpose their authority to deprive him of a part 
<A NAME="888"></A>of his army; yet he neither gave credit to any story concerning Labienus, 
<A NAME="889"></A>nor could be prevailed upon to do any thing in opposition to the authority 
<A NAME="890"></A>of the senate; for he thought that his cause would be easily gained by 
<A NAME="891"></A>the free voice of the senators. For Caius Curio, one of the tribunes of 
<A NAME="892"></A>the people, having undertaken to defend Caesar's cause and dignity, had 
<A NAME="893"></A>often proposed to the senate, "that if the dread of Caesar's arms rendered 
<A NAME="894"></A>any apprehensive, as Pompey's authority and arms were no less formidable 
<A NAME="895"></A>to the forum, both should resign their command, and disband their armies. 
<A NAME="896"></A>That then the city would be free, and enjoy its due rights." And he not 
<A NAME="897"></A>only proposed this, but of himself called upon the senate to divide on 
<A NAME="898"></A>the question. But the consuls and Pompey's friends interposed to prevent 
<A NAME="899"></A>it; and regulating matters as they desired, they broke up the 
<A NAME="900"></A>meeting.
<A NAME="901"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 53</B>
<A NAME="902"></A><BR><BR>This testimony of the unanimous voice of the senate was very great, 
<A NAME="903"></A>and consistent with their former conduct; for the preceding year, when 
<A NAME="904"></A>Marcellus attacked Caesar's dignity, he proposed to the senate, contrary 
<A NAME="905"></A>to the law of Pompey and Crassus, to dispose of Caesar's province, before 
<A NAME="906"></A>the expiration of his command, and when the votes were called for, and 
<A NAME="907"></A>Marcellus, who endeavored to advance his own dignity, by raising envy against 
<A NAME="908"></A>Caesar, wanted a division, the full senate went over to the opposite side. 
<A NAME="909"></A>The spirit of Caesar's foes was not broken by this, but it taught them, 
<A NAME="910"></A>that they ought to strengthen their interest by enlarging their connections, 
<A NAME="911"></A>so as to force the senate to comply with whatever they had resolved 
<A NAME="912"></A>on.
<A NAME="913"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 54</B>
<A NAME="914"></A><BR><BR>After this a decree was passed by the senate, that one legion should 
<A NAME="915"></A>be sent by Pompey, and another by Caesar, to the Parthian war. But these 
<A NAME="916"></A>two legions were evidently drawn from Caesar alone. For the first legion 
<A NAME="917"></A>which Pompey sent to Caesar, he gave Caesar, as if it belonged to himself, 
<A NAME="918"></A>though it was levied in Caesar's province. Caesar, however, though no one 
<A NAME="919"></A>could doubt the design of his enemies, sent the legion back to Cneius Pompey, 
<A NAME="920"></A>and in compliance with the decree of the senate, ordered the fifteenth, 
<A NAME="921"></A>belonging to himself, and which was quartered in Cisalpine Gaul, to be 
<A NAME="922"></A>delivered up. In its room he sent the thirteenth into Italy, to protect 
<A NAME="923"></A>the garrisons from which he had drafted the fifteenth. He disposed his 
<A NAME="924"></A>army in winter quarters, placed Caius Trebonius, with four legions among 
<A NAME="925"></A>the Belgae, and detached Caius Fabius, with four more, to the Aedui; for 
<A NAME="926"></A>he thought that Gaul would be most secure, if the Belgae, a people of the 
<A NAME="927"></A>greatest valor, and the Aedui, who possessed the most powerful influence, 
<A NAME="928"></A>were kept in awe by his armies.
<A NAME="929"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 55</B>
<A NAME="930"></A><BR><BR>He himself set out for Italy; where he was informed on his arrival, 
<A NAME="931"></A>that the two legions sent home by him, and which by the senate's decree, 
<A NAME="932"></A>should have been sent to the Parthian war, had been delivered over to Pompey, 
<A NAME="933"></A>by Caius Marcellus the consul, and were retained in Italy. Although from 
<A NAME="934"></A>this transaction it was evident to every one that war was designed against 
<A NAME="935"></A>Caesar, yet he resolved to submit to any thing, as long as there were hopes 
<A NAME="936"></A>left of deciding the dispute in an equitable manner, rather than to have 
<A NAME="937"></A>recourse to arms.
