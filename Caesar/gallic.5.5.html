<A NAME="start"></A>
<A NAME="10"></A><B>Chapter 1</B>
<A NAME="11"></A><BR><BR>Lucius Domitius and Appius Claudius being consuls, Caesar, when 
<A NAME="12"></A>departing from his winter quarters into Italy, as he had been accustomed 
<A NAME="13"></A>to do yearly, commands the lieutenants whom he appointed over the legions 
<A NAME="14"></A>to take care that during the winter as many ships as possible should be 
<A NAME="15"></A>built, and the old repaired. He plans the size and shape of them. For dispatch 
<A NAME="16"></A>of lading, and for drawing them on shore, he makes them a little lower 
<A NAME="17"></A>than those which we have been accustomed to use in our sea; and that so 
<A NAME="18"></A>much the more, because he knew that, on account of the frequent changes 
<A NAME="19"></A>of the tide, less swells occurred there; for the purpose of transporting 
<A NAME="20"></A>burdens and a great number of horses, [he makes them] a little broader 
<A NAME="21"></A>than those which we use in other seas. All these he orders to be constructed 
<A NAME="22"></A>for lightness and expedition, to which object their lowness contributes 
<A NAME="23"></A>greatly. He orders those things which are necessary for equipping ships 
<A NAME="24"></A>to be brought thither from Spain. He himself, on the assizes of Hither 
<A NAME="25"></A>Gaul being concluded, proceeds into Illyricum, because he heard that the 
<A NAME="26"></A>part of the province nearest them was being laid waste by the incursions 
<A NAME="27"></A>of the Pirustae. When he had arrived there, he levies soldiers upon the 
<A NAME="28"></A>states, and orders them to assemble at an appointed place. Which circumstance 
<A NAME="29"></A>having been reported [to them], the Pirustae send embassadors to him to 
<A NAME="30"></A>inform him that no part of those proceedings was done by public deliberation, 
<A NAME="31"></A>and assert that they were ready to make compensation by all means for the 
<A NAME="32"></A>injuries [inflicted]. Caesar, accepting their defense, demands hostages, 
<A NAME="33"></A>and orders them to be brought to him on a specified day, and assures them 
<A NAME="34"></A>that unless they did so he would visit their state with war. These being 
<A NAME="35"></A>brought to him on the day which he had ordered, he appoints arbitrators 
<A NAME="36"></A>between the states, who should estimate the damages and determine the 
<A NAME="37"></A>reparation.
<A NAME="38"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 2</B>
<A NAME="39"></A><BR><BR>These things being finished, and the assizes being concluded, he 
<A NAME="40"></A>returns into Hither Gaul, and proceeds thence to the army. When he had 
<A NAME="41"></A>arrived there, having made a survey of the winter quarter, he finds that, 
<A NAME="42"></A>by the extraordinary ardor of the soldiers, amid the utmost scarcity of 
<A NAME="43"></A>all materials, about six hundred ships of that kind which we have described 
<A NAME="44"></A>above and twenty-eight ships of war, had been built, and were not far from 
<A NAME="45"></A>that state, that they might be launched in a few days. Having commended 
<A NAME="46"></A>the soldiers and those who had presided over the work, he informs them 
<A NAME="47"></A>what he wishes to be done, and orders all the ships to assemble at port 
<A NAME="48"></A>Itius, from which port he had learned that the passage into Britain was 
<A NAME="49"></A>shortest, [being only] about thirty miles from the continent. He left what 
<A NAME="50"></A>seemed a sufficient number of soldiers for that design; he himself proceeds 
<A NAME="51"></A>into the territories of the Treviri with four legions without baggage, 
<A NAME="52"></A>and 800 horse, because they neither came to the general diets [of Gaul], 
<A NAME="53"></A>nor obeyed his commands, and were moreover, said to be tampering with the 
<A NAME="54"></A>Germans beyond the Rhine.
<A NAME="55"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 3</B>
<A NAME="56"></A><BR><BR>This state is by far the most powerful of all Gaul in cavalry, 
<A NAME="57"></A>and has great forces of infantry, and as we have remarked above, borders 
<A NAME="58"></A>on the Rhine. In that state, two persons, Indutiomarus and Cingetorix, 
<A NAME="59"></A>were then contending with each other for the supreme power; one of whom, 
<A NAME="60"></A>as soon as the arrival of Caesar and his legions was known, came to him; 
<A NAME="61"></A>assures him that he and all his party would continue in their allegiance, 
<A NAME="62"></A>and not revolt from the alliance of the Roman people, and informs him of 
<A NAME="63"></A>the things which were going on among the Treviri. But Indutiomarus began 
<A NAME="64"></A>to collect cavalry and infantry, and make preparations for war, having 
<A NAME="65"></A>concealed those who by reason of their age could not be under arms, in 
<A NAME="66"></A>the forest Arduenna, which is of immense size, [and] extends from the Rhine 
<A NAME="67"></A>across the country of the Treviri to the frontiers of the Remi. But after 
<A NAME="68"></A>that, some of the chief persons of the state, both influenced by their 
<A NAME="69"></A>friendship for Cingetorix, and alarmed at the arrival of our army, came 
<A NAME="70"></A>to Caesar and began to solicit him privately about their own interests, 
<A NAME="71"></A>since they could not provide for the safety of the state; Indutiomarus, 
<A NAME="72"></A>dreading lest he should be abandoned by all, sends embassadors to Caesar, 
<A NAME="73"></A>to declare that he absented himself from his countrymen, and refrained 
<A NAME="74"></A>from coming to him on this account, that he might the more easily keep 
<A NAME="75"></A>the state in its allegiance, lest on the departure of all the nobility 
<A NAME="76"></A>the commonalty should, in their indiscretion, revolt. And thus the whole 
<A NAME="77"></A>state was at his control; and that he, if Caesar would permit, would come 
<A NAME="78"></A>to the camp to him, and would commit his own fortunes and those of the 
<A NAME="79"></A>state to his good faith.
<A NAME="80"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 4</B>
<A NAME="81"></A><BR><BR>Caesar, though he discerned from what motive these things were 
<A NAME="82"></A>said, and what circumstances deterred him from his meditated plan, still, 
<A NAME="83"></A>in order that he might not be compelled to waste the summer among the Treviri, 
<A NAME="84"></A>while all things were prepared for the war with Britain, ordered Indutiomarus 
<A NAME="85"></A>to come to him with 200 hostages. When they were brought, [and] among them 
<A NAME="86"></A>his son and near relations, whom he had demanded by name, he consoled Indutiomarus, 
<A NAME="87"></A>and enjoined him to continue in his allegiance; yet, nevertheless, summoning 
<A NAME="88"></A>to him the chief men of the Treviri, he reconciled them individually to 
<A NAME="89"></A>Cingetorix: this he both thought should be done by him in justice to the 
<A NAME="90"></A>merits of the latter, and also judged that it was of great importance that 
<A NAME="91"></A>the influence of one whose singular attachment toward him he had fully 
<A NAME="92"></A>seen, should prevail as much as possible among his people. Indutiomarus 
<A NAME="93"></A>was very much offended at this act, [seeing that] his influence was diminished 
<A NAME="94"></A>among his countrymen; and he, who already before had borne a hostile mind 
<A NAME="95"></A>toward us, was much more violently inflamed against us through resentment 
<A NAME="96"></A>at this.
<A NAME="97"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 5</B>
<A NAME="98"></A><BR><BR>These matters being settled, Caesar went to port Itius with the 
<A NAME="99"></A>legions. There he discovers that forty ships, which had been built in the 
<A NAME="100"></A>country of the Meldi, having been driven back by a storm, had been unable 
<A NAME="101"></A>to maintain their course, and had returned to the same port from which 
<A NAME="102"></A>they had set out; he finds the rest ready for sailing, and furnished with 
<A NAME="103"></A>every thing. In the same place, the cavalry of the whole of Gaul, in number 
<A NAME="104"></A>4,000, assembles, and [also] the chief persons of all the states; he had 
<A NAME="105"></A>determined to leave in Gaul a very few of them, whose fidelity toward him 
<A NAME="106"></A>he had clearly discerned, and take the rest with him as hostages; because 
<A NAME="107"></A>he feared a commotion in Gaul when he should be absent.
<A NAME="108"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 6</B>
<A NAME="109"></A><BR><BR>There was together with the others, Dumnorix, the Aeduan, of whom 
<A NAME="110"></A>we have made previous mention. Him, in particular, he had resolved to have 
<A NAME="111"></A>with him, because he had discovered him to be fond of change, fond of power, 
<A NAME="112"></A>possessing great resolution, and great influence among the Gauls. To this 
<A NAME="113"></A>was added, that Dumnorix had before said in an assembly of Aeduans, that 
<A NAME="114"></A>the sovereignty of the state had been made over to him by Caesar; which 
<A NAME="115"></A>speech the Aedui bore with impatience and yet dared not send embassadors 
<A NAME="116"></A>to Caesar for the purpose of either rejecting or deprecating [that appointment]. 
<A NAME="117"></A>That fact Caesar had learned from his own personal friends. He at first 
<A NAME="118"></A>strove to obtain by every entreaty that he should be left in Gaul; partly, 
<A NAME="119"></A>because, being unaccustomed to sailing, he feared the sea; partly because 
<A NAME="120"></A>he said he was prevented by divine admonitions. After he saw that this 
<A NAME="121"></A>request was firmly refused him, all hope of success being lost, he began 
<A NAME="122"></A>to tamper with the chief persons of the Gauls, to call them apart singly 
<A NAME="123"></A>and exhort them to remain on the continent; to agitate them with the fear 
<A NAME="124"></A>that it was not without reason that Gaul should be stripped of all her 
<A NAME="125"></A>nobility; that it was Caesar's design, to bring over to Britain and put 
<A NAME="126"></A>to death all those whom he feared to slay in the sight of Gaul, to pledge 
<A NAME="127"></A>his honor to the rest, to ask for their oath that they would by common 
<A NAME="128"></A>deliberation execute what they should perceive to be necessary for Gaul. 
<A NAME="129"></A>These things were reported to Caesar by several persons.
<A NAME="130"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 7</B>
<A NAME="131"></A><BR><BR>Having learned this fact, Caesar, because he had conferred so much 
<A NAME="132"></A>honor upon the Aeduan state, determined that Dumnorix should be restrained 
<A NAME="133"></A>and deterred by whatever means he could; and that, because he perceived 
<A NAME="134"></A>his insane designs to be proceeding further and further, care should be 
<A NAME="135"></A>taken lest he might be able to injure him and the commonwealth. Therefore, 
<A NAME="136"></A>having stayed about twenty-five days in that place, because the north wind, 
<A NAME="137"></A>which usually blows a great part of every season, prevented the voyage, 
<A NAME="138"></A>he exerted himself to keep Dumnorix in his allegiance [and] nevertheless 
<A NAME="139"></A>learn all his measures: having at length met with favorable weather, he 
<A NAME="140"></A>orders the foot soldiers and the horse to embark in the ships. But, while 
<A NAME="141"></A>the minds of all were occupied, Dumnorix began to take his departure from 
<A NAME="142"></A>the camp homeward with the cavalry of the Aedui, Caesar being ignorant 
<A NAME="143"></A>of it. Caesar, on this matter being reported to him, ceasing from his expedition 
<A NAME="144"></A>and deferring all other affairs, sends a great part of the cavalry to pursue 
<A NAME="145"></A>him, and commands that he be brought back; he orders that if he use violence 
<A NAME="146"></A>and do not submit, that he be slain; considering that Dumnorix would do 
<A NAME="147"></A>nothing as a rational man while he himself was absent, since he had disregarded 
<A NAME="148"></A>his command even when present. He, however, when recalled, began to resist 
<A NAME="149"></A>and defend himself with his hand, and implore the support of his people, 
<A NAME="150"></A>often exclaiming that "he was free and the subject of a free state." They 
<A NAME="151"></A>surround and kill the man as they had been commanded; but the Aeduan horsemen 
<A NAME="152"></A>all return to Caesar.
<A NAME="153"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 8</B>
<A NAME="154"></A><BR><BR>When these things were done [and] Labienus, left on the continent 
<A NAME="155"></A>with three legions and 2,000 horse, to defend the harbors and provide corn, 
<A NAME="156"></A>and discover what was going on in Gaul, and take measures according to 
<A NAME="157"></A>the occasion and according to the circumstance; he himself, with five legions 
<A NAME="158"></A>and a number of horse, equal to that which he was leaving on the continent, 
<A NAME="159"></A>set sail at sun-set, and [though for a time] borne forward by a gentle 
<A NAME="160"></A>south-west wind, he did not maintain his course, in consequence of the 
<A NAME="161"></A>wind dying away about midnight, and being carried on too far by the tide, 
<A NAME="162"></A>when the sun rose, espied Britain passed on his left. Then, again, following 
<A NAME="163"></A>the change of tide, he urged on with the oars that he might make that part 
<A NAME="164"></A>of the island in which he had discovered the preceding summer, that there 
<A NAME="165"></A>was the best landing-place, and in this affair the spirit of our soldiers 
<A NAME="166"></A>was very much to be extolled; for they with the transports and heavy ships, 
<A NAME="167"></A>the labor of rowing not being [for a moment] discontinued, equaled the 
<A NAME="168"></A>speed of the ships of war. All the ships reached Britain nearly at mid-day; 
<A NAME="169"></A>nor was there seen a [single] enemy in that place, but, as Caesar afterward 
<A NAME="170"></A>found from some prisoners, though large bodies of troops had assembled 
<A NAME="171"></A>there, yet being alarmed by the great number of our ships, more than eight 
<A NAME="172"></A>hundred of which, including the ships of the preceding year, and those 
<A NAME="173"></A>private vessels which each had built for his own convenience, had appeared 
<A NAME="174"></A>at one time, they had quitted the coast and concealed themselves among 
<A NAME="175"></A>the higher points.
<A NAME="176"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 9</B>
<A NAME="177"></A><BR><BR>Caesar, having disembarked his army and chosen a convenient place 
<A NAME="178"></A>for the camp, when he discovered from the prisoners in what part the forces 
<A NAME="179"></A>of the enemy had lodged themselves, having left ten cohorts and 300 horse 
<A NAME="180"></A>at the sea, to be a guard to the ships, hastens to the enemy, at the third 
<A NAME="181"></A>watch, fearing the less for the ships, for this reason because he was leaving 
<A NAME="182"></A>them fastened at anchor upon an even and open shore; and he placed Q. Atrius 
<A NAME="183"></A>over the guard of the ships. He himself, having advanced by night about 
<A NAME="184"></A>twelve miles, espied the forces of the enemy. They, advancing to the river 
<A NAME="185"></A>with their cavalry and chariots from the higher ground, began to annoy 
<A NAME="186"></A>our men and give battle. Being repulsed by our cavalry, they concealed 
<A NAME="187"></A>themselves in woods, as they had secured a place admirably fortified by 
<A NAME="188"></A>nature and by art, which, as it seemed, they had before prepared on account 
<A NAME="189"></A>of a civil war; for all entrances to it were shut up by a great number 
<A NAME="190"></A>of felled trees. They themselves rushed out of the woods to fight here 
<A NAME="191"></A>and there, and prevented our men from entering their fortifications. But 
<A NAME="192"></A>the soldiers of the seventh legion, having formed a testudo and thrown 
<A NAME="193"></A>up a rampart against the fortification, took the place and drove them out 
<A NAME="194"></A>of the woods, receiving only a few wounds. But Caesar forbade his men to 
<A NAME="195"></A>pursue them in their flight any great distance; both because he was ignorant 
<A NAME="196"></A>of the nature of the ground, and because, as a great part of the day was 
<A NAME="197"></A>spent, he wished time to be left for the fortification of the 
<A NAME="198"></A>camp.
<A NAME="199"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 10</B>
<A NAME="200"></A><BR><BR>The next day, early in the morning, he sent both foot-soldiers 
<A NAME="201"></A>and horse in three divisions on an expedition to pursue those who had fled. 
<A NAME="202"></A>These having advanced a little way, when already the rear [of the enemy] 
<A NAME="203"></A>was in sight, some horse came to Caesar from Quintus Atrius, to report 
<A NAME="204"></A>that the preceding night, a very great storm having arisen, almost all 
<A NAME="205"></A>the ships were dashed to pieces and cast upon the shore, because neither 
<A NAME="206"></A>the anchors and cables could resist, nor could the sailors and pilots sustain 
<A NAME="207"></A>the violence of the storm; and thus great damage was received by that collision 
<A NAME="208"></A>of the ships.
<A NAME="209"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 11</B>
<A NAME="210"></A><BR><BR>These things being known [to him], Caesar orders the legions and 
<A NAME="211"></A>cavalry to be recalled and to cease from their march; he himself returns 
<A NAME="212"></A>to the ships: he sees clearly before him almost the same things which he 
<A NAME="213"></A>had heard of from the messengers and by letter, so that, about forty ships 
<A NAME="214"></A>being lost, the remainder seemed capable of being repaired with much labor. 
<A NAME="215"></A>Therefore he selects workmen from the legions, and orders others to be 
<A NAME="216"></A>sent for from the continent; he writes to Labienus to build as many ships 
<A NAME="217"></A>as he could with those legions which were with him. He himself, though 
<A NAME="218"></A>the matter was one of great difficulty and labor, yet thought it to be 
<A NAME="219"></A>most expedient for all the ships to be brought up on shore and joined with 
<A NAME="220"></A>the camp by one fortification. In these matters he employed about ten days, 
<A NAME="221"></A>the labor of the soldiers being unremitting even during the hours of night. 
<A NAME="222"></A>The ships having been brought up on shore and the camp strongly fortified, 
<A NAME="223"></A>he left the same forces as he did before as a guard for the ships; he sets 
<A NAME="224"></A>out in person for the same place that he had returned from. When he had 
<A NAME="225"></A>come thither, greater forces of the Britons had already assembled at that 
<A NAME="226"></A>place, the chief command and management of the war having been intrusted 
<A NAME="227"></A>to Cassivellaunus, whose territories a river, which is called the Thames, 
<A NAME="228"></A>separates, from the maritime states at about eighty miles from the sea. 
<A NAME="229"></A>At an earlier period perpetual wars had taken place between him and the 
<A NAME="230"></A>other states; but, greatly alarmed by our arrival, the Britons had placed 
<A NAME="231"></A>him over the whole war and the conduct of it.
<A NAME="232"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 12</B>
<A NAME="233"></A><BR><BR>The interior portion of Britain is inhabited by those of whom they 
<A NAME="234"></A>say that it is handed down by tradition that they were born in the island 
<A NAME="235"></A>itself: the maritime portion by those who had passed over from the country 
<A NAME="236"></A>of the Belgae for the purpose of plunder and making war; almost all of 
<A NAME="237"></A>whom are called by the names of those states from which being sprung they 
<A NAME="238"></A>went thither, and having waged war, continued there and began to cultivate 
<A NAME="239"></A>the lands. The number of the people is countless, and their buildings exceedingly 
<A NAME="240"></A>numerous, for the most part very like those of the Gauls: the number of 
<A NAME="241"></A>cattle is great. They use either brass or iron rings, determined at a certain 
<A NAME="242"></A>weight, as their money. Tin is produced in the midland regions; in the 
<A NAME="243"></A>maritime, iron; but the quantity of it is small: they employ brass, which 
<A NAME="244"></A>is imported. There, as in Gaul, is timber of every description, except 
<A NAME="245"></A>beech and fir. They do not regard it lawful to eat the hare, and the cock, 
<A NAME="246"></A>and the goose; they, however, breed them for amusement and pleasure. The 
<A NAME="247"></A>climate is more temperate than in Gaul, the colds being less 
<A NAME="248"></A>severe.
<A NAME="249"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 13</B>
<A NAME="250"></A><BR><BR>The island is triangular in its form, and one of its sides is opposite 
<A NAME="251"></A>to Gaul. One angle of this side, which is in Kent, whither almost all ships 
<A NAME="252"></A>from Gaul are directed, [looks] to the east; the lower looks to the south. 
<A NAME="253"></A>This side extends about 500 miles. Another side lies toward Spain and the 
<A NAME="254"></A>west, on which part is Ireland, less, as is reckoned, than Britain, by 
<A NAME="255"></A>one half: but the passage [from it] into Britain is of equal distance with 
<A NAME="256"></A>that from Gaul. In the middle of this voyage, is an island, which is called 
<A NAME="257"></A>Mona: many smaller islands besides are supposed to lie [there], of which 
<A NAME="258"></A>islands some have written that at the time of the winter solstice it is 
<A NAME="259"></A>night there for thirty consecutive days. We, in our inquiries about that 
<A NAME="260"></A>matter, ascertained nothing, except that, by accurate measurements with 
<A NAME="261"></A>water, we perceived the nights to be shorter there than on the continent. 
<A NAME="262"></A>The length of this side, as their account states, is 700 miles. The third 
<A NAME="263"></A>side is toward the north, to which portion of the island no land is opposite; 
<A NAME="264"></A>but an angle of that side looks principally toward Germany. This side is 
<A NAME="265"></A>considered to be 800 miles in length. Thus the whole island is [about] 
<A NAME="266"></A>2,000 miles in circumference.
<A NAME="267"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 14</B>
<A NAME="268"></A><BR><BR>The most civilized of all these nations are they who inhabit Kent, 
<A NAME="269"></A>which is entirely a maritime district, nor do they differ much from the 
<A NAME="270"></A>Gallic customs. Most of the inland inhabitants do not sow corn, but live 
<A NAME="271"></A>on milk and flesh, and are clad with skins. All the Britains, indeed, dye 
<A NAME="272"></A>themselves with wood, which occasions a bluish color, and thereby have 
<A NAME="273"></A>a more terrible appearance in fight. They wear their hair long, and have 
<A NAME="274"></A>every part of their body shaved except their head and upper lip. Ten and 
<A NAME="275"></A>even twelve have wives common to them, and particularly brothers among 
<A NAME="276"></A>brothers, and parents among their children; but if there be any issue by 
<A NAME="277"></A>these wives, they are reputed to be the children of those by whom respectively 
<A NAME="278"></A>each was first espoused when a virgin.
<A NAME="279"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 15</B>
<A NAME="280"></A><BR><BR>The horse and charioteers of the enemy contended vigorously in 
<A NAME="281"></A>a skirmish with our cavalry on the march; yet so that our men were conquerors 
<A NAME="282"></A>in all parts, and drove them to their woods and hills; but, having slain 
<A NAME="283"></A>a great many, they pursued too eagerly, and lost some of their men. But 
<A NAME="284"></A>the enemy, after some time had elapsed, when our men were off their guard, 
<A NAME="285"></A>and occupied in the fortification of the camp, rushed out of the woods, 
<A NAME="286"></A>and making an attack upon those who were placed on duty before the camp, 
<A NAME="287"></A>fought in a determined manner; and two cohorts being sent by Caesar to 
<A NAME="288"></A>their relief, and these severally the first of two legions, when these 
<A NAME="289"></A>had taken up their position at a very small distance from each other, as 
<A NAME="290"></A>our men were disconcerted by the unusual mode of battle, the enemy broke 
<A NAME="291"></A>through the middle of them most courageously, and retreated thence in safety. 
<A NAME="292"></A>That day, Q. Laberius Durus, a tribune of the soldiers, was slain. The 
<A NAME="293"></A>enemy, since more cohorts were sent against them, were 
<A NAME="294"></A>repulsed.
<A NAME="295"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 16</B>
<A NAME="296"></A><BR><BR>In the whole of this method of fighting since the engagement took 
<A NAME="297"></A>place under the eyes of all and before the camp, it was perceived that 
<A NAME="298"></A>our men, on account of the weight of their arms, inasmuch as they could 
<A NAME="299"></A>neither pursue [the enemy when] retreating, nor dare quit their standards, 
<A NAME="300"></A>were little suited to this kind of enemy; that the horse also fought with 
<A NAME="301"></A>great danger, because they [the Britons] generally retreated even designedly, 
<A NAME="302"></A>and, when they had drawn off our men a short distance from the legions, 
<A NAME="303"></A>leaped from their chariots and fought on foot in unequal [and to them advantageous] 
<A NAME="304"></A>battle. But the system of cavalry engagement is wont to produce equal danger, 
<A NAME="305"></A>and indeed the same, both to those who retreat and to those who pursue. 
<A NAME="306"></A>To this was added, that they never fought in close order, but in small 
<A NAME="307"></A>parties and at great distances, and had detachments placed [in different 
<A NAME="308"></A>parts], and then the one relieved the other, and the vigorous and fresh 
<A NAME="309"></A>succeeded the wearied.
<A NAME="310"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 17</B>
<A NAME="311"></A><BR><BR>The following day the enemy halted on the hills, a distance from 
<A NAME="312"></A>our camp, and presented themselves in small parties, and began to challenge 
<A NAME="313"></A>our horse to battle with less spirit than the day before. But at noon, 
<A NAME="314"></A>when Caesar had sent three legions, and all the cavalry, with C. Trebonius, 
<A NAME="315"></A>the lieutenant, for the purpose of foraging, they flew upon the foragers 
<A NAME="316"></A>suddenly from all quarters, so that they did not keep off [even] from the 
<A NAME="317"></A>standards and the legions. Our men making an attack on them vigorously, 
<A NAME="318"></A>repulsed them; nor did they cease to pursue them until the horse, relying 
<A NAME="319"></A>on relief, as they saw the legions behind them, drove the enemy precipitately 
<A NAME="320"></A>before them, and slaying a great number of them, did not give them the 
<A NAME="321"></A>opportunity either of rallying, or halting, or leaping from their chariots. 
<A NAME="322"></A>Immediately after this retreat, the auxiliaries who had assembled from 
<A NAME="323"></A>all sides, departed; nor after that time did the enemy ever engage with 
<A NAME="324"></A>us in very large numbers.
<A NAME="325"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 18</B>
<A NAME="326"></A><BR><BR>Caesar, discovering their design, leads his army into the territories 
<A NAME="327"></A>of Cassivellaunus to the river Thames; which river can be forded in one 
<A NAME="328"></A>place only and that with difficulty. When he had arrived there, he perceives 
<A NAME="329"></A>that numerous forces of the enemy were marshaled on the other bank of the 
<A NAME="330"></A>river; the bank also was defended by sharp stakes fixed in front, and stakes 
<A NAME="331"></A>of the same kind fixed under the water were covered by the river. These 
<A NAME="332"></A>things being discovered from [some] prisoners and deserters, Caesar, sending 
<A NAME="333"></A>forward the cavalry, ordered the legions to follow them immediately. But 
<A NAME="334"></A>the soldiers advanced with such speed and such ardor, though they stood 
<A NAME="335"></A>above the water by their heads only, that the enemy could not sustain the 
<A NAME="336"></A>attack of the legions and of the horse, and quitted the banks, and committed 
<A NAME="337"></A>themselves to flight.
<A NAME="338"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 19</B>
<A NAME="339"></A><BR><BR>Cassivellaunus, as we have stated above, all hope [rising out] 
<A NAME="340"></A>of battle being laid aside, the greater part of his forces being dismissed, 
<A NAME="341"></A>and about 4,000 charioteers only being left, used to observe our marches 
<A NAME="342"></A>and retire a little from the road, and conceal himself in intricate and 
<A NAME="343"></A>woody places, and in those neighborhoods in which he had discovered we 
<A NAME="344"></A>were about to march, he used to drive the cattle and the inhabitants from 
<A NAME="345"></A>the fields into the woods; and, when our cavalry, for the sake of plundering 
<A NAME="346"></A>and ravaging the more freely, scattered themselves among the fields, he 
<A NAME="347"></A>used to send out charioteers from the woods by all the well-known roads 
<A NAME="348"></A>and paths, and to the great danger of our horse, engage with them; and 
<A NAME="349"></A>this source of fear hindered them from straggling very extensively. The 
<A NAME="350"></A>result was, that Caesar did not allow excursions to be made to a great 
<A NAME="351"></A>distance from the main body of the legions, and ordered that damage should 
<A NAME="352"></A>be done to the enemy in ravaging their lands, and kindling fires only so 
<A NAME="353"></A>far as the legionary soldiers could, by their own exertion and marching, 
<A NAME="354"></A>accomplish it.
<A NAME="355"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 20</B>
<A NAME="356"></A><BR><BR>In the mean time, the Trinobantes, almost the most powerful state 
<A NAME="357"></A>of those parts, from which the young man, Mandubratius embracing the protection 
<A NAME="358"></A>of Caesar had come to the continent of Gaul to [meet] him (whose father, 
<A NAME="359"></A>Imanuentius, had possessed the sovereignty in that state, and had been 
<A NAME="360"></A>killed by Cassivellaunus; he himself had escaped death by flight), send 
<A NAME="361"></A>embassadors to Caesar, and promise that they will surrender themselves 
<A NAME="362"></A>to him and perform his commands; they entreat him to protect Mandubratius 
<A NAME="363"></A>from the violence of Cassivellaunus, and send to their state some one to 
<A NAME="364"></A>preside over it, and possess the government. Caesar demands forty hostages 
<A NAME="365"></A>from them, and corn for his army, and sends Mandubratius to them. They 
<A NAME="366"></A>speedily performed the things demanded, and sent hostages to the number 
<A NAME="367"></A>appointed, and the corn.
<A NAME="368"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 21</B>
<A NAME="369"></A><BR><BR>The Trinobantes being protected and secured from any violence of 
<A NAME="370"></A>the soldiers, the Cenimagni, the Segontiaci, the Ancalites, the Bibroci, 
<A NAME="371"></A>and the Cassi, sending embassies, surrendered themselves to Caesar. From 
<A NAME="372"></A>them he learns that the capital town of Cassivellaunus was not far from 
<A NAME="373"></A>that place, and was defended by woods and morasses, and a very large number 
<A NAME="374"></A>of men and of cattle had been collected in it. (Now the Britons, when they 
<A NAME="375"></A>have fortified the intricate woods, in which they are wont to assemble 
<A NAME="376"></A>for the purpose of avoiding the incursion of an enemy, with an intrenchment 
<A NAME="377"></A>and a rampart, call them a town.) Thither he proceeds with his legions: 
<A NAME="378"></A>he finds the place admirably fortified by nature and art; he, however, 
<A NAME="379"></A>undertakes to attack it in two directions. The enemy, having remained only 
<A NAME="380"></A>a short time, did not sustain the attack of our soldiers, and hurried away 
<A NAME="381"></A>on the other side of the town. A great amount of cattle was found there, 
<A NAME="382"></A>and many of the enemy were taken and slain in their 
<A NAME="383"></A>flight.
<A NAME="384"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 22</B>
<A NAME="385"></A><BR><BR>While these things are going forward in those places, Cassivellaunus 
<A NAME="386"></A>sends messengers into Kent, which, we have observed above, is on the sea, 
<A NAME="387"></A>over which districts four several kings reigned, Cingetorix, Carvilius, 
<A NAME="388"></A>Taximagulus and Segonax, and commands them to collect all their forces, 
<A NAME="389"></A>and unexpectedly assail and storm the naval camp. When they had come to 
<A NAME="390"></A>the camp, our men, after making a sally, slaying many of their men, and 
<A NAME="391"></A>also capturing a distinguished leader named Lugotorix, brought back their 
<A NAME="392"></A>own men in safety. Cassivellaunus, when this battle was reported to him 
<A NAME="393"></A>as so many losses had been sustained, and his territories laid waste, being 
<A NAME="394"></A>alarmed most of all by the desertion of the states, sends embassadors to 
<A NAME="395"></A>Caesar [to treat] about a surrender through the mediation of Commius the 
<A NAME="396"></A>Atrebatian. Caesar, since he had determined to pass the winter on the continent, 
<A NAME="397"></A>on account of the sudden revolts of Gaul, and as much of the summer did 
<A NAME="398"></A>not remain, and he perceived that even that could be easily protracted, 
<A NAME="399"></A>demands hostages, and prescribes what tribute Britain should pay each year 
<A NAME="400"></A>to the Roman people; he forbids and commands Cassivellaunus that he wage 
<A NAME="401"></A>not war against Mandubratius or the Trinobantes.
<A NAME="402"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 23</B>
<A NAME="403"></A><BR><BR>When he had received the hostages, he leads back the army to the 
<A NAME="404"></A>sea, and finds the ships repaired. After launching these, because he had 
<A NAME="405"></A>a large number of prisoners, and some of the ships had been lost in the 
<A NAME="406"></A>storm, he determines to convey back his army at two embarkations. And it 
<A NAME="407"></A>so happened, that out of so large a number of ships, in so many voyages, 
<A NAME="408"></A>neither in this nor in the previous year was any ship missing which conveyed 
<A NAME="409"></A>soldiers; but very few out of those which were sent back to him from the 
<A NAME="410"></A>continent empty, as the soldiers of the former convoy had been disembarked, 
<A NAME="411"></A>and out of those (sixty in number) which Labienus had taken care to have 
<A NAME="412"></A>built, reached their destination; almost all the rest were driven back, 
<A NAME="413"></A>and when Caesar had waited for them for some time in vain, lest he should 
<A NAME="414"></A>be debarred from a voyage by the season of the year, inasmuch as the equinox 
<A NAME="415"></A>was at hand, he of necessity stowed his soldiers the more closely, and, 
<A NAME="416"></A>a very great calm coming on, after he had weighed anchor at the beginning 
<A NAME="417"></A>of the second watch, he reached land at break of day and brought in all 
<A NAME="418"></A>the ships in safety.
<A NAME="419"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 24</B>
<A NAME="420"></A><BR><BR>The ships having been drawn up and a general assembly of the Gauls 
<A NAME="421"></A>held at Samarobriva, because the corn that year had not prospered in Gaul 
<A NAME="422"></A>by reason of the droughts, he was compelled to station his army in its 
<A NAME="423"></A>winter-quarters differently from the former years, and to distribute the 
<A NAME="424"></A>legions among several states: one of them he gave to C. Fabius, his lieutenant, 
<A NAME="425"></A>to be marched into the territories of the Morini; a second to Q. Cicero, 
<A NAME="426"></A>into those of the Nervii; a third to L. Roscius, into those of the Essui; 
<A NAME="427"></A>a fourth he ordered to winter with T. Labienus among the Remi in the confines 
<A NAME="428"></A>of the Treviri; he stationed three in Belgium; over these he appointed 
<A NAME="429"></A>M. Crassus, his questor, and L. Munatius Plancus and C. Trebonius, his 
<A NAME="430"></A>lieutenants. One legion which he had raised last on the other side of the 
<A NAME="431"></A>Po, and five cohorts, he sent among the Eburones, the greatest portion 
<A NAME="432"></A>of whom lie between the Meuse and the Rhine, [and] who were under the government 
<A NAME="433"></A>of Ambiorix and Cativolcus. He ordered Q. Titurius Sabinus and L. Aurunculeius 
<A NAME="434"></A>Cotta, his lieutenants, to take command of these soldiers. The legions 
<A NAME="435"></A>being distributed in this manner, he thought he could most easily remedy 
<A NAME="436"></A>the scarcity of corn and yet the winter-quarters of all these legions (except 
<A NAME="437"></A>that which he had given to L. Roscius, to be led into the most peaceful 
<A NAME="438"></A>and tranquil neighborhood) were comprehended within [about] 100 miles. 
<A NAME="439"></A>He himself in the mean while, until he had stationed the legions and knew 
<A NAME="440"></A>that the several winter-quarters were fortified, determined to stay in 
<A NAME="441"></A>Gaul.
<A NAME="442"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 25</B>
<A NAME="443"></A><BR><BR>There was among the Carnutes a man named Tasgetius, born of very 
<A NAME="444"></A>high rank, whose ancestors had held the sovereignty in his state. To him 
<A NAME="445"></A>Caesar had restored the position of his ancestors, in consideration of 
<A NAME="446"></A>his prowess and attachment toward him, because in all his wars he had availed 
<A NAME="447"></A>himself of his valuable services. His personal enemies had killed him when 
<A NAME="448"></A>in the third year of his reign, many even of his own state being openly 
<A NAME="449"></A>promoters [of that act] This event is related to Caesar. He fearing, because 
<A NAME="450"></A>several were involved in the act, that the state might revolt at their 
<A NAME="451"></A>instigation, orders Lucius Plancus, with a legion, to proceed quickly from 
<A NAME="452"></A>Belgium to the Carnutes, and winter there, and arrest and send to him the 
<A NAME="453"></A>persons by whose instrumentality he should discover that Tasgetius was 
<A NAME="454"></A>slain. In the mean time, he was apprised by all the lieutenants and questors 
<A NAME="455"></A>to whom he had assigned the legions, that they had arrived in winter-quarters, 
<A NAME="456"></A>and that the place for the quarters was fortified.
<A NAME="457"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 26</B>
<A NAME="458"></A><BR><BR>About fifteen days after they had come into winter-quarters, the 
<A NAME="459"></A>beginning of a sudden insurrection and revolt arose from Ambiorix and Cativolcus, 
<A NAME="460"></A>who, though they had met with Sabinus and Cotta at the borders of their 
<A NAME="461"></A>kingdom, and had conveyed corn into our winter-quarters, induced by the 
<A NAME="462"></A>messages of Indutiomarus, one of the Treviri, excited their people, and 
<A NAME="463"></A>after having suddenly assailed the soldiers engaged in procuring wood, 
<A NAME="464"></A>came with a large body to attack the camp. When our men had speedily taken 
<A NAME="465"></A>up arms and had ascended the rampart, and sending out some Spanish horse 
<A NAME="466"></A>on one side, had proved conquerors in a cavalry action, the enemy, despairing 
<A NAME="467"></A>of success, drew off their troops from the assault. Then they shouted, 
<A NAME="468"></A>according to their custom, that some of our men should go forward to a 
<A NAME="469"></A>conference, [alleging] that they had some things which they desired to 
<A NAME="470"></A>say respecting the common interest, by which they trusted their disputes 
<A NAME="471"></A>could be removed.
<A NAME="472"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 27</B>
<A NAME="473"></A><BR><BR><B>C.</B> Arpineius, a Roman knight, the intimate friend of Q. 
<A NAME="474"></A>Titurius, and with him, Q. Junius, a certain person from Spain, who already 
<A NAME="475"></A>on previous occasions, had been accustomed to go to Ambiorix, at Caesar's 
<A NAME="476"></A>mission, is sent to them for the purpose of a conference: before them Ambiorix 
<A NAME="477"></A>spoke to this effect: "That he confessed, that for Caesar's kindness toward 
<A NAME="478"></A>him, he was very much indebted to him, inasmuch as by his aid he had been 
<A NAME="479"></A>freed from a tribute which he had been accustomed to pay to the Aduatuci, 
<A NAME="480"></A>his neighbors; and because his own son and the son of his brother had been 
<A NAME="481"></A>sent back to him, whom, when sent in the number of hostages, the Aduatuci 
<A NAME="482"></A>had detained among them in slavery and in chains; and that he had not done 
<A NAME="483"></A>that which he had done in regard to the attacking of the camp, either by 
<A NAME="484"></A>his own judgment or desire, but by the compulsion of his state; and that 
<A NAME="485"></A>his government was of that nature, that the people had as much authority 
<A NAME="486"></A>over him as he over the people. To the state moreover the occasion of the 
<A NAME="487"></A>war was this - that it could not withstand the sudden combination of the 
<A NAME="488"></A>Gauls; that he could easily prove this from his own weakness, since he 
<A NAME="489"></A>was not so little versed in affairs as to presume that with his forces 
<A NAME="490"></A>he could conquer the Roman people; but that it was the common resolution 
<A NAME="491"></A>of Gaul; that that day was appointed for the storming of all Caesar's winter-quarters, 
<A NAME="492"></A>in order that no legion should be able to come to the relief of another 
<A NAME="493"></A>legion, that Gauls could not easily deny Gauls, especially when a measure 
<A NAME="494"></A>seemed entered into for recovering their common freedom. Since he had performed 
<A NAME="495"></A>his duty to them on the score of patriotism [he said], he has now regard 
<A NAME="496"></A>to gratitude for the kindness of Caesar; that he warned, that he prayed 
<A NAME="497"></A>Titurius by the claims of hospitality, to consult for his and his soldiers' 
<A NAME="498"></A>safely; that a large force of the Germans had been hired and had passed 
<A NAME="499"></A>the Rhine; that it would arrive in two days: that it was for them to consider 
<A NAME="500"></A>whether they thought fit, before the nearest people perceived it, to lead 
<A NAME="501"></A>off their soldiers when drawn out of winter-quarters, either to Cicero 
<A NAME="502"></A>or to Labienus; one of whom was about fifty miles distant from them, the 
<A NAME="503"></A>other rather more; that this he promised and confirmed by oath, that he 
<A NAME="504"></A>would give them a safe passage through his territories; and when he did 
<A NAME="505"></A>that, he was both consulting for his own state, because it would be relieved 
<A NAME="506"></A>from the winter-quarters, and also making a requital to Caesar for his 
<A NAME="507"></A>obligations."
<A NAME="508"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 28</B>
<A NAME="509"></A><BR><BR>Arpineius and Junius relate to the lieutenants what they had heard. 
<A NAME="510"></A>They, greatly alarmed by the unexpected affair, though those things were 
<A NAME="511"></A>spoken by an enemy, still thought they were not to be disregarded; and 
<A NAME="512"></A>they were especially influenced by this consideration, that it was scarcely 
<A NAME="513"></A>credible that the obscure and humble state of the Eburones had dared to 
<A NAME="514"></A>make war upon the Roman people of their own accord. Accordingly, they refer 
<A NAME="515"></A>the matter to a council, and a great controversy arises among them. L. 
<A NAME="516"></A>Aurunculeius, and several tribunes of the soldiers and the centurions of 
<A NAME="517"></A>the first rank, were of opinion "that nothing should be done hastily, and 
<A NAME="518"></A>that they should not depart from the camp without Caesar's orders;" they 
<A NAME="519"></A>declared, "that any forces of the Germans, however great, might be encountered 
<A NAME="520"></A>by fortified winter-quarters; that this fact was a proof [of it]; that 
<A NAME="521"></A>they had sustained the first assault of the Germans most valiantly, inflicting 
<A NAME="522"></A>many wounds upon them; that they were not distressed for corn; that in 
<A NAME="523"></A>the mean time relief would come both from the nearest winter-quarters and 
<A NAME="524"></A>from Caesar; lastly, they put the query, "what could be more undetermined, 
<A NAME="525"></A>more undignified, than to adopt measures respecting the most important 
<A NAME="526"></A>affairs on the authority of an enemy?"
<A NAME="527"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 29</B>
<A NAME="528"></A><BR><BR>In opposition to those things, Titurius exclaimed, "That they would 
<A NAME="529"></A>do this too late, when greater forces of the enemy, after a junction with 
<A NAME="530"></A>the Germans, should have assembled; or when some disaster had been received 
<A NAME="531"></A>in the neighboring winter-quarters; that the opportunity for deliberating 
<A NAME="532"></A>was short; that he believed that Caesar had set forth into Italy, as the 
<A NAME="533"></A>Carnutes would not otherwise have taken the measure of slaying Tasgetius, 
<A NAME="534"></A>nor would the Eburones, if he had been present, have come to the camp with 
<A NAME="535"></A>so great defiance of us; that he did not regard the enemy, but the fact, 
<A NAME="536"></A>as the authority; that the Rhine was near; that the death of Ariovistus 
<A NAME="537"></A>and our previous victories were subjects of great indignation to the Germans; 
<A NAME="538"></A>that Gaul was inflamed, that after having received so many defeats she 
<A NAME="539"></A>was reduced under the sway of the Roman people, her pristine glory in military 
<A NAME="540"></A>matters being extinguished." Lastly, "who would persuade himself of this, 
<A NAME="541"></A>that Ambiorix had resorted to a design of that nature without sure grounds? 
<A NAME="542"></A>That his own opinion was safe on either side; if there be nothing very 
<A NAME="543"></A>formidable, they would go without danger to the nearest legion; if all 
<A NAME="544"></A>Gaul conspired with the Germans, their only safety lay in dispatch. What 
<A NAME="545"></A>issue would the advice of Cotta and of those who differed from him, have? 
<A NAME="546"></A>from which, if immediate danger was not to be dreaded, yet certainly famine, 
<A NAME="547"></A>by a protracted siege, was."
<A NAME="548"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 30</B>
<A NAME="549"></A><BR><BR>This discussion having been held on the two sides, when opposition 
<A NAME="550"></A>was offered strenuously by Cotta and the principal officers, "Prevail," 
<A NAME="551"></A>said Sabinus, "if so you wish it;" and he said it with a louder voice, 
<A NAME="552"></A>that a great portion of the soldiers might hear him; "nor am I the person 
<A NAME="553"></A>among you," he said, "who is most powerfully alarmed by the danger of death; 
<A NAME="554"></A>these will be aware of it, and then, if any thing disastrous shall have 
<A NAME="555"></A>occurred, they will demand a reckoning at your hands; these, who, if it 
<A NAME="556"></A>were permitted by you, united three days hence with the nearest winter-quarters, 
<A NAME="557"></A>may encounter the common condition of war with the rest, and not, as if 
<A NAME="558"></A>forced away and separated far from the rest, perish either by the sword 
<A NAME="559"></A>or by famine."
<A NAME="560"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 31</B>
<A NAME="561"></A><BR><BR>They rise from the council, detain both, and entreat, that "they 
<A NAME="562"></A>do not bring the matter into the greatest jeopardy by their dissension 
<A NAME="563"></A>and obstinacy; the affair was an easy one, if only they all thought and 
<A NAME="564"></A>approved of the same thing, whether they remain or depart; on the other 
<A NAME="565"></A>hand, they saw no security in dissension." The matter is prolonged by debate 
<A NAME="566"></A>till midnight. At last Cotta, being overruled, yields his assent; the opinion 
<A NAME="567"></A>of Sabinus prevails. It is proclaimed that they will march at day-break; 
<A NAME="568"></A>the remainder of the night is spent without sleep, since every soldier 
<A NAME="569"></A>was inspecting his property, [to see] what he could carry with him, and 
<A NAME="570"></A>what, out of the appurtenances of the winter-quarters, he would be compelled 
<A NAME="571"></A>to leave; every reason is suggested to show why they could not stay without 
<A NAME="572"></A>danger, and how that danger would be increased by the fatigue of the soldiers 
<A NAME="573"></A>and their want of sleep. At break of day they quit the camp, in a very 
<A NAME="574"></A>extended line and with a very large amount of baggage, in such a manner 
<A NAME="575"></A>as men who were convinced that the advice was given by Ambiorix, not as 
<A NAME="576"></A>an enemy, but as most friendly [toward them].
<A NAME="577"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 32</B>
<A NAME="578"></A><BR><BR>But the enemy, after they had made the discovery of their intended 
<A NAME="579"></A>departure by the noise during the night and their not retiring to rest, 
<A NAME="580"></A>having placed an ambuscade in two divisions in the woods, in a suitable 
<A NAME="581"></A>and concealed place, two miles from the camp, waited for the arrival of 
<A NAME="582"></A>the Romans: and when the greater part of the line of march had descended 
<A NAME="583"></A>into a considerable valley, they suddenly presented themselves on either 
<A NAME="584"></A>side of that valley, and began both to harass the rear and hinder the van 
<A NAME="585"></A>from ascending, and to give battle in a place exceedingly disadvantageous 
<A NAME="586"></A>to our men.
<A NAME="587"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 33</B>
<A NAME="588"></A><BR><BR>Then at length Titurius, as one who had provided nothing beforehand, 
<A NAME="589"></A>was confused, ran to and fro, and set about arranging his troops; these 
<A NAME="590"></A>very things, however, he did timidly and in such a manner that all resources 
<A NAME="591"></A>seemed to fail him: which generally happens to those who are compelled 
<A NAME="592"></A>to take council in the action itself. But Cotta, who had reflected that 
<A NAME="593"></A>these things might occur on the march, and on that account had not been 
<A NAME="594"></A>an adviser of the departure, was wanting to the common safety in no respect; 
<A NAME="595"></A>both in addressing and encouraging the soldiers, he performed the duties 
<A NAME="596"></A>of a general, and in the battle those of a soldier. And since they [Titurius 
<A NAME="597"></A>and Cotta] could less easily perform every thing by themselves, and provide 
<A NAME="598"></A>what was to be done in each place, by reason of the length of the line 
<A NAME="599"></A>of march, they ordered [the officers] to give the command that they should 
<A NAME="600"></A>leave the baggage and form themselves into an orb, which measure, though 
<A NAME="601"></A>in a contingency of that nature it was not to be condemned, still turned 
<A NAME="602"></A>out unfortunately; for it both diminished the hope of our soldiers and 
<A NAME="603"></A>rendered the enemy more eager for the fight, because it appeared that this 
<A NAME="604"></A>was not done without the greatest fear and despair. Besides that happened, 
<A NAME="605"></A>which would necessarily be the case, that the soldiers for the most part 
<A NAME="606"></A>quitted their ensigns and hurried to seek and carry off from the baggage 
<A NAME="607"></A>whatever each thought valuable, and all parts were filled with uproar and 
<A NAME="608"></A>lamentation.
<A NAME="609"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 34</B>
<A NAME="610"></A><BR><BR>But judgment was not wanting to the barbarians; for their leaders 
<A NAME="611"></A>ordered [the officers] to proclaim through the ranks "that no man should 
<A NAME="612"></A>quit his place; that the booty was theirs, and for them was reserved whatever 
<A NAME="613"></A>the Romans should leave; therefore let them consider that all things depended 
<A NAME="614"></A>on their victory. Our men were equal to them in fighting, both in courage 
<A NAME="615"></A>and in number, and though they were deserted by their leader and by fortune, 
<A NAME="616"></A>yet they still placed all hope of safety in their valor, and as often as 
<A NAME="617"></A>any cohort sallied forth on that side, a great number of the enemy usually 
<A NAME="618"></A>fell. Ambiorix, when he observed this, orders the command to be issued 
<A NAME="619"></A>that they throw their weapons from a distance and do not approach too near, 
<A NAME="620"></A>and in whatever direction the Romans should make an attack, there give 
<A NAME="621"></A>way (from the lightness of their appointments and from their daily practice 
<A NAME="622"></A>no damage could be done them); [but] pursue them when betaking themselves 
<A NAME="623"></A>to their standards again.
<A NAME="624"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 35</B>
<A NAME="625"></A><BR><BR>Which command having been most carefully obeyed, when any cohort 
<A NAME="626"></A>had quitted the circle and made a charge, the enemy fled very precipitately. 
<A NAME="627"></A>In the mean time, that part of the Roman army, of necessity, was left unprotected, 
<A NAME="628"></A>and the weapons received on their open flank. Again, when they had begun 
<A NAME="629"></A>to return to that place from which they had advanced, they were surrounded 
<A NAME="630"></A>both by those who had retreated and by those who stood next them; but if, 
<A NAME="631"></A>on the other hand, they wish to keep their place, neither was an opportunity 
<A NAME="632"></A>left for valor, nor could they, being crowded together, escape the weapons 
<A NAME="633"></A>cast by so large a body of men. Yet, though assailed by so many disadvantages, 
<A NAME="634"></A>[and] having received many wounds, they withstood the enemy, and, a great 
<A NAME="635"></A>portion of the day being spent, though they fought from day-break till 
<A NAME="636"></A>the eighth hour, they did nothing which was unworthy of them. At length, 
<A NAME="637"></A>each thigh of T. Balventius, who the year before had been chief centurion, 
<A NAME="638"></A>a brave man and one of great authority, is pierced with a javelin; Q. Lucanius, 
<A NAME="639"></A>of the same rank, fighting most valiantly, is slain while he assists his 
<A NAME="640"></A>son when surrounded by the enemy; L. Cotta, the lieutenant, when encouraging 
<A NAME="641"></A>all the cohorts and companies, is wounded full in the mouth by a 
<A NAME="642"></A>sling.
<A NAME="643"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 36</B>
<A NAME="644"></A><BR><BR>Much troubled by these events, Q. Titurius, when he had perceived 
<A NAME="645"></A>Ambiorix in the distance encouraging his men, sends to him his interpreter, 
<A NAME="646"></A>Cn. Pompey, to beg that he would spare him and his soldiers. He, when addressed, 
<A NAME="647"></A>replied, "If he wishes to confer with him, it was permitted; that he hoped 
<A NAME="648"></A>what pertained to the safety of the soldiers could be obtained from the 
<A NAME="649"></A>people; that to him however certainly no injury would be done, and that 
<A NAME="650"></A>he pledged his faith to that effect." He consults with Cotta, who had been 
<A NAME="651"></A>wounded, whether it would appear right to retire from battle, and confer 
<A NAME="652"></A>with Ambiorix; [saying] that he hoped to be able to succeed respecting 
<A NAME="653"></A>his own and the soldiers' safety. Cotta says he will not go to an armed 
<A NAME="654"></A>enemy, and in that perseveres.
<A NAME="655"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 37</B>
<A NAME="656"></A><BR><BR>Sabinus orders those tribunes of the soldiers whom he had at the 
<A NAME="657"></A>time around him, and the centurions of the first ranks, to follow him, 
<A NAME="658"></A>and when he had approached near to Ambiorix, being ordered to throw down 
<A NAME="659"></A>his arms, he obeys the order and commands his men to do the same. In the 
<A NAME="660"></A>mean time, while they treat upon the terms, and a longer debate than necessary 
<A NAME="661"></A>is designedly entered into by Ambiorix, being surrounded by degrees, he 
<A NAME="662"></A>is slain. Then they, according to their custom, shout out "Victory," and 
<A NAME="663"></A>raise their war-cry, and, making an attack on our men, break their ranks. 
<A NAME="664"></A>There L. Cotta, while fighting, is slain, together with the greater part 
<A NAME="665"></A>of the soldiers; the rest betake themselves to the camp, from which they 
<A NAME="666"></A>had marched forth, and one of them, L. Petrosidius, the standard bearer, 
<A NAME="667"></A>when he was overpowered by the great number of the enemy, threw the eagle 
<A NAME="668"></A>within the intrenchments and is himself slain while fighting with the greatest 
<A NAME="669"></A>courage before the camp. They with difficulty sustain the attack till night; 
<A NAME="670"></A>despairing of safety, they all to a man destroy themselves in the night. 
<A NAME="671"></A>A few escaping from the battle, made their way to Labienus at winter-quarters, 
<A NAME="672"></A>after wandering at random through the woods, and inform him of these 
<A NAME="673"></A>events
<A NAME="674"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 38</B>
<A NAME="675"></A><BR><BR>Elated by this victory, Ambiorix marches immediately with his cavalry 
<A NAME="676"></A>to the Aduatuci, who bordered on his kingdom; he halts neither day nor 
<A NAME="677"></A>night, and orders the infantry to follow him closely. Having related the 
<A NAME="678"></A>exploit and roused the Aduatuci, the next day he arrived among the Nervii, 
<A NAME="679"></A>and entreats "that they should not throw away the opportunity of liberating 
<A NAME="680"></A>themselves forever and of punishing the Romans for those wrongs which they 
<A NAME="681"></A>had received from them;" [he tells them] "that two lieutenants have been 
<A NAME="682"></A>slain, and that a large portion of the army has perished; that it was not 
<A NAME="683"></A>a matter of difficulty for the legion which was wintering with Cicero to 
<A NAME="684"></A>be cut off, when suddenly assaulted; he declares himself ready to cooperate 
<A NAME="685"></A>in that design. He easily gains over the Nervii by this 
<A NAME="686"></A>speech.
<A NAME="687"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 39</B>
<A NAME="688"></A><BR><BR>Accordingly, messengers having been forthwith dispatched to the 
<A NAME="689"></A>Centrones, the Grudii, the Levaci, the Pleumoxii, and the Geiduni, all 
<A NAME="690"></A>of whom are under their government, they assemble as large bodies as they 
<A NAME="691"></A>can, and rush unexpectedly to the winter-quarters of Cicero, the report 
<A NAME="692"></A>of the death of Titurius not having as yet been conveyed to him. That also 
<A NAME="693"></A>occurred to him, which was the consequence of a necessary work - that some 
<A NAME="694"></A>soldiers who had gone off into the woods for the purpose of procuring timber 
<A NAME="695"></A>and therewith constructing fortifications, were intercepted by the sudden 
<A NAME="696"></A>arrival of [the enemy's] horse. These having been entrapped, the Eburones, 
<A NAME="697"></A>the Nervii, and the Aduatici and all their allies and dependents, begin 
<A NAME="698"></A>to attack the legion: our men quickly run together to arms and mount the 
<A NAME="699"></A>rampart; they sustained the attack that day with great difficulty, since 
<A NAME="700"></A>the enemy placed all their hope in dispatch, and felt assured that, if 
<A NAME="701"></A>they obtained this victory, they would be conquerors 
<A NAME="702"></A>forever.
<A NAME="703"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 40</B>
<A NAME="704"></A><BR><BR>Letters are immediately sent to Caesar by Cicero, great rewards 
<A NAME="705"></A>being offered [to the messengers] if they carried them through. All these 
<A NAME="706"></A>passes having been beset, those who were sent are intercepted. During the 
<A NAME="707"></A>night as many as 120 towers are raised with incredible dispatch out of 
<A NAME="708"></A>the timber which they had collected for the purpose of fortification: the 
<A NAME="709"></A>things which seemed necessary to the work are completed. The following 
<A NAME="710"></A>day the enemy, having collected far greater forces, attack the camp [and] 
<A NAME="711"></A>fill up the ditch. Resistance is made by our men in the same manner as 
<A NAME="712"></A>the day before; this same thing is done afterward during the remaining 
<A NAME="713"></A>days. The work is carried on incessantly in the night: not even to the 
<A NAME="714"></A>sick, or wounded, is opportunity given for rest: whatever things are required 
<A NAME="715"></A>for resisting the assault of the next day are provided during the night: 
<A NAME="716"></A>many stakes burned at the end, and a large number of mural pikes are procured: 
<A NAME="717"></A>towers are built up, battlements and parapets are formed of interwoven 
<A NAME="718"></A>hurdles. Cicero himself, though he was in very weak health, did not leave 
<A NAME="719"></A>himself the night-time for repose, so that he was forced to spare himself 
<A NAME="720"></A>by the spontaneous movement and entreaties of the soldiers.
<A NAME="721"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 41</B>
<A NAME="722"></A><BR><BR>Then these leaders and chiefs of the Nervii, who had any intimacy 
<A NAME="723"></A>and grounds of friendship with Cicero, say they desire to confer with him. 
<A NAME="724"></A>When permission was granted, they recount the same things which Ambiorix 
<A NAME="725"></A>had related to Titurius, namely, "that all Gaul was in arms, that the Germans 
<A NAME="726"></A>had passed the Rhine, that the winter-quarters of Caesar and of the others 
<A NAME="727"></A>were attacked." They report in addition also, about the death of Sabinus. 
<A NAME="728"></A>They point to Ambiorix for the purpose of obtaining credence; "they are 
<A NAME="729"></A>mistaken," say they, "if they hoped for any relief from those who distrust 
<A NAME="730"></A>their own affairs; that they bear such feelings toward Cicero and the Roman 
<A NAME="731"></A>people that they deny them nothing but winter-quarters, and are unwilling 
<A NAME="732"></A>that the practice should become constant; that through their [the Nervii's] 
<A NAME="733"></A>means it is possible for them [the Romans] to depart from their winter-quarters 
<A NAME="734"></A>safely and to proceed without fear into whatever parts they desire." To 
<A NAME="735"></A>these Cicero made only one reply: "that it is not the custom of the Roman 
<A NAME="736"></A>people to accept any condition from an armed enemy: if they are willing 
<A NAME="737"></A>to lay down their arms, they may employ him as their advocate and send 
<A NAME="738"></A>embassadors to Caesar: that he believed, from his [Caesar's] justice, they 
<A NAME="739"></A>would obtain the things which they might request."
<A NAME="740"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 42</B>
<A NAME="741"></A><BR><BR>Disappointed in this hope, the Nervii surround the winter-quarters 
<A NAME="742"></A>with a rampart eleven feet high, and a ditch thirteen feet in depth. These 
<A NAME="743"></A>military works they had learned from our men in the intercourse of former 
<A NAME="744"></A>years, and, having taken some of our army prisoners, were instructed by 
<A NAME="745"></A>them: but, as they had no supply of iron tools which are requisite for 
<A NAME="746"></A>this service, they were forced to cut the turf with their swords, and to 
<A NAME="747"></A>empty out the earth with their hands and cloaks, from which circumstance, 
<A NAME="748"></A>the vast number of the men could be inferred; for in less than three hours 
<A NAME="749"></A>they completed a fortification of ten miles in circumference; and during 
<A NAME="750"></A>the rest of the days they began to prepare and construct towers of the 
<A NAME="751"></A>height of the ramparts, and grappling irons, and mantelets, which the same 
<A NAME="752"></A>prisoners had taught them.
<A NAME="753"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 43</B>
<A NAME="754"></A><BR><BR>On the seventh day of the attack, a very high wind having sprung 
<A NAME="755"></A>up, they began to discharge by their slings hot balls made of burned or 
<A NAME="756"></A>hardened clay, and heated javelins, upon the huts, which, after the Gallic 
<A NAME="757"></A>custom, were thatched with straw. These quickly took fire, and by the violence 
<A NAME="758"></A>of the wind, scattered their flames in every part of the camp. The enemy 
<A NAME="759"></A>following up their success with a very loud shout, as if victory were already 
<A NAME="760"></A>obtained and secured, began to advance their towers and mantelets, and 
<A NAME="761"></A>climb the rampart with ladders. But so great was the courage of our soldiers, 
<A NAME="762"></A>and such their presence of mind, that though they were scorched on all 
<A NAME="763"></A>sides, and harassed by a vast number of weapons, and were aware that their 
<A NAME="764"></A>baggage and their possessions were burning, not only did no one quit the 
<A NAME="765"></A>rampart for the purpose of withdrawing from the scene, but scarcely did 
<A NAME="766"></A>any one even then look behind; and they all fought most vigorously and 
<A NAME="767"></A>most valiantly. This day was by far the most calamitous to our men; it 
<A NAME="768"></A>had this result, however, that on that day the largest number of the enemy 
<A NAME="769"></A>was wounded and slain, since they had crowded beneath the very rampart, 
<A NAME="770"></A>and the hindmost did not afford the foremost a retreat. The flame having 
<A NAME="771"></A>abated a little, and a tower having been brought up in a particular place 
<A NAME="772"></A>and touching the rampart, the centurions of the third cohort retired from 
<A NAME="773"></A>the place in which they were standing, and drew off all their men: they 
<A NAME="774"></A>began to call on the enemy by gestures and by words, to enter if they wished; 
<A NAME="775"></A>but none of them dared to advance. Then stones having been cast from every 
<A NAME="776"></A>quarter, the enemy were dislodged, and their tower set on 
<A NAME="777"></A>fire.
<A NAME="778"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 44</B>
<A NAME="779"></A><BR><BR>In that legion there were two very brave men, centurions, who were 
<A NAME="780"></A>now approaching the first ranks, T. Pulfio, and L. Varenus. These used 
<A NAME="781"></A>to have continual disputes between them which of them should be preferred, 
<A NAME="782"></A>and every year used to contend for promotion with the utmost animosity. 
<A NAME="783"></A>When the fight was going on most vigorously before the fortifications, 
<A NAME="784"></A>Pulfio, one of them, says, "Why do you hesitate, Varenus? or what [better] 
<A NAME="785"></A>opportunity of signalizing your valor do you seek? This very day shall 
<A NAME="786"></A>decide our disputes." When he had uttered these words, he proceeds beyond 
<A NAME="787"></A>the fortifications, and rushes on that part of the enemy which appeared 
<A NAME="788"></A>the thickest. Nor does Varenus remain within the rampart, but respecting 
<A NAME="789"></A>the high opinion of all, follows close after. Then, when an inconsiderable 
<A NAME="790"></A>space intervened, Pulfio throws his javelin at the enemy, and pierces one 
<A NAME="791"></A>of the multitude who was running up, and while the latter was wounded and 
<A NAME="792"></A>slain, the enemy cover him with their shields, and all throw their weapons 
<A NAME="793"></A>at the other and afford him no opportunity of retreating. The shield of 
<A NAME="794"></A>Pulfio is pierced and a javelin is fastened in his belt. This circumstance 
<A NAME="795"></A>turns aside his scabbard and obstructs his right hand when attempting to 
<A NAME="796"></A>draw his sword: the enemy crowd around him when [thus] embarrassed. His 
<A NAME="797"></A>rival runs up to him and succors him in this emergency. Immediately the 
<A NAME="798"></A>whole host turn from Pulfio to him, supposing the other to be pierced through 
<A NAME="799"></A>by the javelin. Varenus rushes on briskly with his sword and carries on 
<A NAME="800"></A>the combat hand to hand, and having slain one man, for a short time drove 
<A NAME="801"></A>back the rest: while he urges on too eagerly, slipping into a hollow, he 
<A NAME="802"></A>fell. To him, in his turn, when surrounded, Pulfio brings relief; and both 
<A NAME="803"></A>having slain a great number, retreat into the fortifications amid the highest 
<A NAME="804"></A>applause. Fortune so dealt with both in this rivalry and conflict, that 
<A NAME="805"></A>the one competitor was a succor and a safeguard to the other, nor could 
<A NAME="806"></A>it be determined which of the two appeared worthy of being preferred to 
<A NAME="807"></A>the other.
<A NAME="808"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 45</B>
<A NAME="809"></A><BR><BR>In proportion as the attack became daily more formidable and violent, 
<A NAME="810"></A>and particularly, because, as a great number of the soldiers were exhausted 
<A NAME="811"></A>with wounds, the matter had come to a small number of defenders, more frequent 
<A NAME="812"></A>letters and messages were sent to Caesar; a part of which messengers were 
<A NAME="813"></A>taken and tortured to death in the sight of our soldiers. There was within 
<A NAME="814"></A>our camp a certain Nervian, by name Vertico, born in a distinguished position, 
<A NAME="815"></A>who in the beginning of the blockade had deserted to Cicero, and had exhibited 
<A NAME="816"></A>his fidelity to him. He persuades his slave, by the hope of freedom, and 
<A NAME="817"></A>by great rewards, to convey a letter to Caesar. This he carries out bound 
<A NAME="818"></A>about his javelin; and mixing among the Gauls without any suspicion by 
<A NAME="819"></A>being a Gaul, he reaches Caesar. From him they received information of 
<A NAME="820"></A>the imminent danger of Cicero and the legion.
<A NAME="821"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 46</B>
<A NAME="822"></A><BR><BR>Caesar having received the letter about the eleventh hour of the 
<A NAME="823"></A>day, immediately sends a messenger to the Bellovaci, to M. Crassus, questor 
<A NAME="824"></A>there, whose winter-quarters were twenty-five miles distant from him. He 
<A NAME="825"></A>orders the legion to set forward in the middle of the night, and come to 
<A NAME="826"></A>him with dispatch. Crassus sets out with the messenger. He sends another 
<A NAME="827"></A>to C. Fabius, the lieutenant, ordering him to lead forth his legion into 
<A NAME="828"></A>the territories of the Atrebates, to which he knew his march must be made. 
<A NAME="829"></A>He writes to Labienus to come with his legion to the frontiers of the Nervii, 
<A NAME="830"></A>if he could do so to the advantage of the commonwealth: he does not consider 
<A NAME="831"></A>that the remaining portion of the army, because it was somewhat further 
<A NAME="832"></A>distant, should be waited for; but assembles about 400 horse from the nearest 
<A NAME="833"></A>winter-quarters.
<A NAME="834"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 47</B>
<A NAME="835"></A><BR><BR>Having been apprised of the arrival of Crassus by the scouts at 
<A NAME="836"></A>about the third hour, he advances twenty miles that day. He appoints Crassus 
<A NAME="837"></A>over Samarobriva and assigns him a legion, because he was leaving there 
<A NAME="838"></A>the baggage of the army, the hostages of the states, the public documents, 
<A NAME="839"></A>and all the corn, which he had conveyed thither for passing the winter. 
<A NAME="840"></A>Fabius, without delaying a moment, meets him on the march with his legion, 
<A NAME="841"></A>as he had been commanded. Labienus, having learned the death of Sabinus 
<A NAME="842"></A>and the destruction of the cohorts, as all the forces of the Treviri had 
<A NAME="843"></A>come against him, beginning to fear lest, if he made a departure from his 
<A NAME="844"></A>winter-quarters, resembling a flight, he should not be able to support 
<A NAME="845"></A>the attack of the enemy, particularly since he knew them to be elated by 
<A NAME="846"></A>their recent victory, sends back a letter to Caesar, informing him with 
<A NAME="847"></A>what great hazard he would lead out his legion from winter-quarters; he 
<A NAME="848"></A>relates at large the affairs which had taken place among the Eburones; 
<A NAME="849"></A>he informs him that all the infantry and cavalry of the Treviri had encamped 
<A NAME="850"></A>at a distance of only three miles from his own camp.
<A NAME="851"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 48</B>
<A NAME="852"></A><BR><BR>Caesar, approving of his motives, although he was disappointed 
<A NAME="853"></A>in his expectation of three legions, and reduced to two, yet placed his 
<A NAME="854"></A>only hopes of the common safety in dispatch. He goes into the territories 
<A NAME="855"></A>of the Nervii by long marches. There he learns from some prisoners what 
<A NAME="856"></A>things are going on in the camp of Cicero, and in how great jeopardy the 
<A NAME="857"></A>affair is. Then with great rewards he induces a certain man of the Gallic 
<A NAME="858"></A>horse to convey a letter to Cicero. This he sends written in Greek characters, 
<A NAME="859"></A>lest the letter being intercepted, our measures should be discovered by 
<A NAME="860"></A>the enemy. He directs him, if he should be unable to enter, to throw his 
<A NAME="861"></A>spear with the letter fastened to the thong, inside the fortifications 
<A NAME="862"></A>of the camp. He writes in the letter, that he having set out with his legions, 
<A NAME="863"></A>will quickly be there: he entreats him to maintain his ancient valor. The 
<A NAME="864"></A>Gaul apprehending danger, throws his spear as he has been directed. Is 
<A NAME="865"></A>by chance stuck in a tower, and, not being observed by our men for two 
<A NAME="866"></A>days, was seen by a certain soldier on the third day: when taken down, 
<A NAME="867"></A>it was carried to Cicero. He, after perusing it, reads it out in an assembly 
<A NAME="868"></A>of the soldiers, and fills all with the greatest joy. Then the smoke of 
<A NAME="869"></A>the fires was seen in the distance, a circumstance which banished all doubt 
<A NAME="870"></A>of the arrival of the legions.
<A NAME="871"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 49</B>
<A NAME="872"></A><BR><BR>The Gauls, having discovered the matter through their scouts, abandon 
<A NAME="873"></A>the blockade, and march toward Caesar with all their forces; these were 
<A NAME="874"></A>about 60,000 armed men. Cicero, an opportunity being now afforded, again 
<A NAME="875"></A>begs of that Vertico, the Gaul, whom we mentioned above, to convey back 
<A NAME="876"></A>a letter to Caesar; he advises him to perform his journey warily; he writes 
<A NAME="877"></A>in the letter that the enemy had departed and had turned their entire force 
<A NAME="878"></A>against him. When this letter was brought to him about the middle of the 
<A NAME="879"></A>night, Caesar apprises his soldiers of its contents, and inspires them 
<A NAME="880"></A>with courage for fighting: the following day, at the dawn, he moves his 
<A NAME="881"></A>camp, and, having proceeded four miles, he espies the forces of the enemy 
<A NAME="882"></A>on the other side of a considerable valley and rivulet. It was an affair 
<A NAME="883"></A>of great danger to fight with such large forces in a disadvantageous situation. 
<A NAME="884"></A>For the present, therefore, inasmuch as he knew that Cicero was released 
<A NAME="885"></A>from the blockade, and thought that he might, on that account, relax his 
<A NAME="886"></A>speed, he halted there and fortifies a camp in the most favorable position 
<A NAME="887"></A>he can. And this, though it was small in itself, [there being] scarcely 
<A NAME="888"></A>7,000 men, and these too without baggage, still by the narrowness of the 
<A NAME="889"></A>passages, he contracts as much as he can, with this object, that he may 
<A NAME="890"></A>come into the greatest contempt with the enemy. In the mean while scouts 
<A NAME="891"></A>having been sent in all directions, he examines by what most convenient 
<A NAME="892"></A>path he might cross the valley.
<A NAME="893"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 50</B>
<A NAME="894"></A><BR><BR>That day, slight skirmishes of cavalry having taken place near 
<A NAME="895"></A>the river, both armies kept in their own positions: the Gauls, because 
<A NAME="896"></A>they were awaiting larger forces which had not then arrived; Caesar, [to 
<A NAME="897"></A>see] if perchance by pretense of fear he could allure the enemy toward 
<A NAME="898"></A>his position, so that he might engage in battle, in front of his camp, 
<A NAME="899"></A>on this side of the valley; if he could not accomplish this, that, having 
<A NAME="900"></A>inquired about the passes, he might cross the valley and the river with 
<A NAME="901"></A>the less hazard. At daybreak the cavalry of the enemy approaches to the 
<A NAME="902"></A>camp and joins battle with our horse. Caesar orders the horse to give way 
<A NAME="903"></A>purposely, and retreat to the camp: at the same time he orders the camp 
<A NAME="904"></A>to be fortified with a higher rampart in all directions, the gates to be 
<A NAME="905"></A>barricaded, and in executing these things as much confusion to be shown 
<A NAME="906"></A>as possible, and to perform them under the pretense of 
<A NAME="907"></A>fear.
<A NAME="908"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 51</B>
<A NAME="909"></A><BR><BR>Induced by all these things, the enemy lead over their forces and 
<A NAME="910"></A>draw up their line in a disadvantageous position; and as our men also had 
<A NAME="911"></A>been led down from the ramparts, they approach nearer, and throw their 
<A NAME="912"></A>weapons into the fortification from all sides, and sending heralds round, 
<A NAME="913"></A>order it to be proclaimed that, if "any, either Gaul or Roman, was willing 
<A NAME="914"></A>to go over to them before the third hour, it was permitted; after that 
<A NAME="915"></A>time there would not be permission;" and so much did they disregard our 
<A NAME="916"></A>men, that the gates having been blocked up with single rows of turf as 
<A NAME="917"></A>a mere appearance, because they did not seem able to burst in that way, 
<A NAME="918"></A>some began to pull down the rampart with their hands, others to fill up 
<A NAME="919"></A>the trenches. Then Caesar, making a sally from all the gates, and sending 
<A NAME="920"></A>out the cavalry, soon puts the enemy to flight, so that no one at all stood 
<A NAME="921"></A>his ground with the intention of fighting; and he slew a great number of 
<A NAME="922"></A>them, and deprived all of their arms.
<A NAME="923"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 52</B>
<A NAME="924"></A><BR><BR>Caesar, fearing to pursue them very far, because woods and morasses 
<A NAME="925"></A>intervened, and also [because] he saw that they suffered no small loss 
<A NAME="926"></A>in abandoning their position, reaches Cicero the same day with all his 
<A NAME="927"></A>forces safe. He witnesses with surprise the towers, mantelets, and [other] 
<A NAME="928"></A>fortifications belonging to the enemy: the legion having been drawn out, 
<A NAME="929"></A>he finds that even every tenth soldier had not escaped without wounds. 
<A NAME="930"></A>From all these things he judges with what danger and with what great courage 
<A NAME="931"></A>matters had been conducted; he commends Cicero according to his desert, 
<A NAME="932"></A>and likewise the legion; he addresses individually the centurions and the 
<A NAME="933"></A>tribunes of the soldiers, whose valor he had discovered to have been signal. 
<A NAME="934"></A>He receives information of the death of Sabinus and Cotta from the prisoners. 
<A NAME="935"></A>An assembly being held the following day, he states the occurrence; he 
<A NAME="936"></A>consoles and encourages the soldiers; he suggests, that the disaster, which 
<A NAME="937"></A>had been occasioned by the misconduct and rashness of his lieutenant, should 
<A NAME="938"></A>be borne with a patient mind, because by the favor of the immortal gods 
<A NAME="939"></A>and their own valor, neither was lasting joy left to the enemy, nor very 
<A NAME="940"></A>lasting grief to them.
<A NAME="941"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 53</B>
<A NAME="942"></A><BR><BR>In the mean while the report respecting the victory of Caesar is 
<A NAME="943"></A>conveyed to Labienus through the country of the Remi with incredible speed, 
<A NAME="944"></A>so that, though he was about sixty miles distant from the winter-quarter 
<A NAME="945"></A>of Cicero, and Caesar had arrived there after the ninth hour, before midnight 
<A NAME="946"></A>a shout arose at the gates of the camp, by which shout an indication of 
<A NAME="947"></A>the victory and a congratulation on the part of the Remi were given to 
<A NAME="948"></A>Labienus. This report having been carried to the Treviri, Indutiomarus, 
<A NAME="949"></A>who had resolved to attack the camp of Labienus the following day, flies 
<A NAME="950"></A>by night and leads back all his forces into the country of the Treviri. 
<A NAME="951"></A>Caesar sends back Fabius with his legion to his winter-quarters; he himself 
<A NAME="952"></A>determines to winter with three legions near Samarobriva in three different 
<A NAME="953"></A>quarters, and, because such great commotions had arisen in Gaul, he resolved 
<A NAME="954"></A>to remain during the whole winter with the army himself. For the disaster 
<A NAME="955"></A>respecting the death of Sabinus having been circulated among them, almost 
<A NAME="956"></A>all the states of Gaul were deliberating about war, sending messengers 
<A NAME="957"></A>and embassies into all quarters, inquiring what further measure they should 
<A NAME="958"></A>take, and holding councils by night in secluded places. Nor did any period 
<A NAME="959"></A>of the whole winter pass over without fresh anxiety to Caesar, or, without 
<A NAME="960"></A>his receiving some intelligence respecting the meetings and commotions 
<A NAME="961"></A>of the Gauls. Among these, he is informed by L. Roscius, the lieutenant 
<A NAME="962"></A>whom he had placed over the thirteenth legion, that large forces of those 
<A NAME="963"></A>states of the Gauls, which are called the Armoricae, had assembled for 
<A NAME="964"></A>the purpose of attacking him and were not more than eight miles distant; 
<A NAME="965"></A>but intelligence respecting the victory of Caesar being carried [to them], 
<A NAME="966"></A>had retreated in such a manner that their departure appeared like a 
<A NAME="967"></A>flight.
<A NAME="968"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 54</B>
<A NAME="969"></A><BR><BR>But Caesar, having summoned to him the principal persons of each 
<A NAME="970"></A>state, in one case by alarming them, since he declared that he knew what 
<A NAME="971"></A>was going on, and in another case by encouraging them, retained a great 
<A NAME="972"></A>part of Gaul in its allegiance. The Senones, however, which is a state 
<A NAME="973"></A>eminently powerful and one of great influence among the Gauls, attempting 
<A NAME="974"></A>by general design to slay Cavarinus, whom Caesar had created king among 
<A NAME="975"></A>them (whose brother, Moritasgus, had held the sovereignty at the period 
<A NAME="976"></A>of the arrival of Caesar in Gaul, and whose ancestors had also previously 
<A NAME="977"></A>held it), when he discovered their plot and fled, pursued him even to the 
<A NAME="978"></A>frontiers [of the state], and drove him from his kingdom and his home; 
<A NAME="979"></A>and, after having sent embassadors to Caesar for the purpose of concluding 
<A NAME="980"></A>a peace, when he ordered all their senate to come to him, did not obey 
<A NAME="981"></A>that command. So far did it operate among those barbarian people, that 
<A NAME="982"></A>there were found some to be the first to wage war; and so great a change 
<A NAME="983"></A>of inclinations did it produce in all, that, except the Aedui and the Remi, 
<A NAME="984"></A>whom Caesar had always held in especial honor, the one people for their 
<A NAME="985"></A>long standing and uniform fidelity toward the Roman people, the other for 
<A NAME="986"></A>their late service in the Gallic war, there was scarcely a state which 
<A NAME="987"></A>was not suspected by us. And I do not know whether that ought much to be 
<A NAME="988"></A>wondered at, as well for several other reasons, as particularly because 
<A NAME="989"></A>they who ranked above all nations for prowess in war, most keenly regretted 
<A NAME="990"></A>that they had lost so much of that reputation as to submit to commands 
<A NAME="991"></A>from the Roman people.
<A NAME="992"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 55</B>
<A NAME="993"></A><BR><BR>But the Triviri and Indutiomarus let no part of the entire winter 
<A NAME="994"></A>pass without sending embassadors across the Rhine, importuning the states, 
<A NAME="995"></A>promising money, and asserting that, as a large portion of our army had 
<A NAME="996"></A>been cut off, a much smaller portion remained. However, none of the German 
<A NAME="997"></A>States could be induced to cross the Rhine, since "they had twice essayed 
<A NAME="998"></A>it," they said, "in the war with Ariovistus and in the passage of the Tenchtheri 
<A NAME="999"></A>there; that fortune was not to be tempted any more." Indutiomarus disappointed 
<A NAME="1000"></A>in this expectation, nevertheless began to raise troops, and discipline 
<A NAME="1001"></A>them, and procure horses from the neighboring people, and allure to him 
<A NAME="1002"></A>by great rewards the outlaws and convicts throughout Gaul. And such great 
<A NAME="1003"></A>influence had he already acquired for himself in Gaul by these means, that 
<A NAME="1004"></A>embassies were flocking to him in all directions, and seeking, publicly 
<A NAME="1005"></A>and privately, his favor and friendship.
<A NAME="1006"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 56</B>
<A NAME="1007"></A><BR><BR>When he perceived that they were coming to him voluntarily; that 
<A NAME="1008"></A>on the one side the Senones and the Carnutes were stimulated by their consciousness 
<A NAME="1009"></A>of guilt, on the other side the Nervii and the Aduatuci were preparing 
<A NAME="1010"></A>war against the Romans, and that forces of volunteers would not be wanting 
<A NAME="1011"></A>to him if he began to advance from his own territories, he proclaims an 
<A NAME="1012"></A>armed council (this according to the custom of the Gauls in the commencement 
<A NAME="1013"></A>of war) at which, by a common law, all the youth were wont to assemble 
<A NAME="1014"></A>in arms, whoever of them comes last is killed in the sight of the whole 
<A NAME="1015"></A>assembly after being racked with every torture. In that council he declares 
<A NAME="1016"></A>Cingetorix, the leader of the other faction, his own son-in-law (whom we 
<A NAME="1017"></A>have above mentioned, as having embraced the protection of Caesar, and 
<A NAME="1018"></A>never having deserted him) an enemy and confiscates his property. When 
<A NAME="1019"></A>these things were finished, he asserts in the council that he, invited 
<A NAME="1020"></A>by the Senones and the Carnutes, and several other states of Gaul, was 
<A NAME="1021"></A>about to march thither through the territories of the Remi, devastate their 
<A NAME="1022"></A>lands, and attack the camp of Labienus: before he does that, he informs 
<A NAME="1023"></A>them of what he desires to be done.
<A NAME="1024"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 57</B>
<A NAME="1025"></A><BR><BR>Labienus, since he was confining himself within a camp strongly 
<A NAME="1026"></A>fortified by the nature of the ground and by art, had no apprehensions 
<A NAME="1027"></A>as to his own and the legion's danger, but was devising that he might throw 
<A NAME="1028"></A>away no opportunity of conducting the war successfully. Accordingly, the 
<A NAME="1029"></A>speech of Indutiomarus, which he had delivered in the council, having been 
<A NAME="1030"></A>made known [to him] by Cingetorix and his allies, he sends messengers to 
<A NAME="1031"></A>the neighboring states and summons horse from all quarters: he appoints 
<A NAME="1032"></A>to them a fixed day for assembling. In the mean time, Indutiomarus, with 
<A NAME="1033"></A>all his cavalry, nearly every day used to parade close to his [Labienus'] 
<A NAME="1034"></A>camp; at one time, that he might inform himself of the situation of the 
<A NAME="1035"></A>camp; at another time, for the purpose of conferring with or of intimidating 
<A NAME="1036"></A>him. Labienus confined his men within the fortifications, and promoted 
<A NAME="1037"></A>the enemy's belief of his fear by whatever methods he 
<A NAME="1038"></A>could.
<A NAME="1039"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 58</B>
<A NAME="1040"></A><BR><BR>Since Indutiomarus was daily advancing up to the camp with greater 
<A NAME="1041"></A>defiance, all the cavalry of the neighboring states which he [Labienus] 
<A NAME="1042"></A>had taken care to have sent for, having been admitted in one night, he 
<A NAME="1043"></A>confined all his men within the camp by guards with such great strictness, 
<A NAME="1044"></A>that that fact could by no means be reported or carried to the Treviri. 
<A NAME="1045"></A>In the mean while, Indutiomarus, according to his daily practice, advances 
<A NAME="1046"></A>up to the camp and spends a great part of the day there: his horse cast 
<A NAME="1047"></A>their weapons, and with very insulting language call out our men to battle. 
<A NAME="1048"></A>No reply being given by our men, the enemy, when they thought proper, depart 
<A NAME="1049"></A>toward evening in a disorderly and scattered manner, Labienus unexpectedly 
<A NAME="1050"></A>sends out all the cavalry by two gates; he gives this command and prohibition, 
<A NAME="1051"></A>that, when the enemy should be terrified and put to flight (which he foresaw 
<A NAME="1052"></A>would happen, as it did), they should all make for Indutiomarus, and no 
<A NAME="1053"></A>one wound any man before he should have seen him slain, because he was 
<A NAME="1054"></A>unwilling that he should escape, in consequence of gaining time by the 
<A NAME="1055"></A>delay [occasioned by the pursuit] of the rest. He offers great rewards 
<A NAME="1056"></A>for those who should kill him: he sends up the cohorts as a relief to the 
<A NAME="1057"></A>horse. The issue justifies the policy of the man, and since all aimed at 
<A NAME="1058"></A>one, Indutiomarus is slain, having been overtaken at the very ford of the 
<A NAME="1059"></A>river, and his head is carried to the camp, the horse, when returning, 
<A NAME="1060"></A>pursue and slay all whom they can. This affair having been known, all the 
<A NAME="1061"></A>forces of the Eburones and the Nervii which had assembled, depart; and 
<A NAME="1062"></A>for a short time after this action, Caesar was less harassed in the government 
<A NAME="1063"></A>of Gaul.
