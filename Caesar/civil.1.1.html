<A NAME="10"></A><B>Chapter 0</B>
<A NAME="11"></A><BR><BR>Vossius's supplement to the first book: I will now say nothing 
<A NAME="12"></A>concerning the absurd opinion of those who assert that the following Commentaries 
<A NAME="13"></A>on the Civil War were not written by Caesar himself. Even without the authority 
<A NAME="14"></A>of Suetonius, the diction itself would be sufficient to convince the most 
<A NAME="15"></A>skeptical that Caesar and no other was the author. I am of the opinion 
<A NAME="16"></A>of those who think that the beginning of these Commentaries is lost. For 
<A NAME="17"></A>I can not be convinced that Caesar commenced so abruptly; and History itself 
<A NAME="18"></A>gives sufficient evidence that many circumstances require to be previously 
<A NAME="19"></A>stated. For which reason we thought that it would be well worth our attention 
<A NAME="20"></A>to compile from Plutarch, Appian, and Dion, a narrative of such facts as 
<A NAME="21"></A>seemed necessary to fill up the chasm; these facts are as follows: "When 
<A NAME="22"></A>Caesar, after reducing all Transalpine Gaul, had passed into Cisalpine 
<A NAME="23"></A>Gaul, he determined for many reasons to send embassadors to Rome to request 
<A NAME="24"></A>for him the consulate, and a prolongation of the command of his province. 
<A NAME="25"></A>Pompey, who was estranged from Caesar, although he was not as yet at open 
<A NAME="26"></A>enmity with him, determined neither to aid him by his influence nor openly 
<A NAME="27"></A>oppose him on this occasion. But the consuls Lentulus and Marcellus, who 
<A NAME="28"></A>had previously been on unfriendly terms with Caesar, resolved to use all 
<A NAME="29"></A>means in their power to prevent him from gaining his object. Marcellus 
<A NAME="30"></A>in particular did not hesitate to offer Caesar other insults. Caesar had 
<A NAME="31"></A>lately planned the colony of Novumcomum in Gaul: Marcellus, not content 
<A NAME="32"></A>with taking from it the right of citizenship, ordered the principal man 
<A NAME="33"></A>of the colony to be arrested and scourged at Rome, and sent him to make 
<A NAME="34"></A>his complaints to Caesar: an insult of this description had never before 
<A NAME="35"></A>been offered to a Roman citizen. While these transactions are taking place, 
<A NAME="36"></A>Caius Curio, tribune of the commons, comes to Caesar in his province. Curio 
<A NAME="37"></A>had made many and energetic struggles, in behalf of the republic and Caesar's 
<A NAME="38"></A>cause: at length when he perceived that all his efforts were vain, he fled 
<A NAME="39"></A>through fear of his adversaries, and informed Caesar of all the transactions 
<A NAME="40"></A>that had taken place, and of the efforts made by his enemies to crush him. 
<A NAME="41"></A>Caesar received Curio with great kindness, as he was a man of the highest 
<A NAME="42"></A>rank, and had great claims on himself and the republic, and thanked him 
<A NAME="43"></A>warmly for his numerous personal favors. But Curio, as war was being openly 
<A NAME="44"></A>prepared against Caesar, advised him to concentrate his troops, and rescue 
<A NAME="45"></A>the republic now oppressed by a few daring men. Caesar, although he was 
<A NAME="46"></A>not ignorant of the real state of affairs, was however of opinion that 
<A NAME="47"></A>particular regard should be paid to the tranquillity of the republic, lest 
<A NAME="48"></A>any one should suppose that he was the originator of the war. Therefore, 
<A NAME="49"></A>through his friends, he made this one request, that two legions, and the 
<A NAME="50"></A>province of Cisalpine Gaul, and Illyricum, should be left him. All these 
<A NAME="51"></A>acts were performed by Caesar, with the hope that his enemies might be 
<A NAME="52"></A>induced by the justice of his demands, to preserve the peace of the republic. 
<A NAME="53"></A>Even Pompey himself did not dare to oppose them. But when Caesar could 
<A NAME="54"></A>not obtain his request from the consuls, he wrote to the senate a letter, 
<A NAME="55"></A>in which he briefly stated his exploits and public services, and entreated 
<A NAME="56"></A>that he should not be deprived of the favor of the people, who had ordered, 
<A NAME="57"></A>that he, although absent, should be considered a candidate at the next 
<A NAME="58"></A>elections; and he stated also that he would disband his army, if the senate 
<A NAME="59"></A>and people of Rome would pass a resolution to that effect, provided that 
<A NAME="60"></A>Pompey would do the same. That, as long as the latter should retain the 
<A NAME="61"></A>command of his army, no just reason could exist that he [Caesar] should 
<A NAME="62"></A>disband his troops and expose himself to the insults of his enemies. He 
<A NAME="63"></A>intrusts this letter to Curio to bear to its destination; the latter traveled 
<A NAME="64"></A>one hundred and sixty miles with incredible dispatch, and reached the city 
<A NAME="65"></A>in three days' time, before the beginning of January, and before the consuls 
<A NAME="66"></A>could pass any decree concerning Caesar's command. Curio, after accomplishing 
<A NAME="67"></A>his journey, kept the letter, and did not give it up, until there was a 
<A NAME="68"></A>crowded meeting of the senate, and the tribunes of the commons were present; 
<A NAME="69"></A>for he was afraid, lest, if he gave it up previously, the consuls should 
<A NAME="70"></A>suppress it.
<A NAME="71"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 1</B>
<A NAME="72"></A><BR><BR>When Caesar's letter was delivered to the consuls, they were with 
<A NAME="73"></A>great difficulty, and a hard struggle of the tribunes, prevailed on to 
<A NAME="74"></A>suffer it to be read in the senate; but the tribunes could not prevail, 
<A NAME="75"></A>that any question should be put to the senate on the subject of the letter. 
<A NAME="76"></A>The consuls put the question on the regulation of the state. Lucius Lentulus 
<A NAME="77"></A>the consul promises that he will not fail the senate and republic, "if 
<A NAME="78"></A>they declared their sentiments boldly and resolutely, but if they turned 
<A NAME="79"></A>their regard to Caesar, and courted his favor, as they did on former occasions, 
<A NAME="80"></A>he would adopt a plan for himself, and not submit to the authority of the 
<A NAME="81"></A>senate: that he too had a means of regaining Caesar's favor and friendship." 
<A NAME="82"></A>Scipio spoke to the same purport, "that it was Pompey's intention not to 
<A NAME="83"></A>abandon the republic, if the senate would support him; but if they should 
<A NAME="84"></A>hesitate and act without energy, they would in vain implore his aid, if 
<A NAME="85"></A>they should require it hereafter."
<A NAME="86"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 2</B>
<A NAME="87"></A><BR><BR>This speech of Scipio's, as the senate was convened in the city, 
<A NAME="88"></A>and Pompey was near at hand, seemed to have fallen from the lips of Pompey 
<A NAME="89"></A>himself. Some delivered their sentiments with more moderation, as Marcellus 
<A NAME="90"></A>first, who in the beginning of his speech, said, "that the question ought 
<A NAME="91"></A>not to be put to the senate on this matter, till levies were made throughout 
<A NAME="92"></A>all Italy, and armies raised under whose protection the senate might freely 
<A NAME="93"></A>and safely pass such resolutions as they thought proper;" as Marcus Calidius 
<A NAME="94"></A>afterward, who was of opinion, "that Pompey should set out for his province, 
<A NAME="95"></A>that there might be no cause for arms; that Caesar was naturally apprehensive 
<A NAME="96"></A>as two legions were forced from him, that Pompey was retaining those troops, 
<A NAME="97"></A>and keeping them near the city to do him injury:" as Marcus Rufus, who 
<A NAME="98"></A>followed Calidius almost word for word. They were all harshly rebuked by 
<A NAME="99"></A>Lentulus, who peremptorily refused to propose Calidius's motion. Marcellus, 
<A NAME="100"></A>overawed by his reproofs, retracted his opinion. Thus most of the senate, 
<A NAME="101"></A>intimidated by the expressions of the consul, by the fears of a present 
<A NAME="102"></A>army, and the threats of Pompey's friends, unwillingly and reluctantly 
<A NAME="103"></A>adopted Scipio's opinion, that Caesar should disband his army by a certain 
<A NAME="104"></A>day, and should he not do so, he should he considered as acting against 
<A NAME="105"></A>the state. Marcus Antonius, and Quintus Cassius, tribunes of the people, 
<A NAME="106"></A>interposed. The question was immediately put on their interposition. Violent 
<A NAME="107"></A>opinions were expressed; whoever spoke with the greatest acrimony and cruelty 
<A NAME="108"></A>was most highly commended by Caesar's enemies.
<A NAME="109"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 3</B>
<A NAME="110"></A><BR><BR>The senate having broken up in the evening, all who belonged to 
<A NAME="111"></A>that order were summoned by Pompey. He applauded the forward, and secured 
<A NAME="112"></A>their votes for the next day; the more moderate he reproved and excited 
<A NAME="113"></A>against Caesar. Many veterans, from all parts, who had served in Pompey's 
<A NAME="114"></A>armies, were invited to his standard by the hopes of rewards and promotions. 
<A NAME="115"></A>Several officers belonging to the two legions, which had been delivered 
<A NAME="116"></A>up by Caesar, were sent for. The city and the comitium were crowded with 
<A NAME="117"></A>tribunes, centurions, and veterans. All the consul's friends, all Pompey's 
<A NAME="118"></A>connections, all those who bore any ancient enmity to Caesar, were forced 
<A NAME="119"></A>into the senate house. By their concourse and declarations the timid were 
<A NAME="120"></A>awed, the irresolute confirmed, and the greater part deprived of the power 
<A NAME="121"></A>of speaking their sentiments with freedom. Lucius Piso, the censor, offered 
<A NAME="122"></A>to go to Caesar: as did likewise Lucius Roscius, the praetor, to inform 
<A NAME="123"></A>him of these affairs, and require only six days' time to finish the business. 
<A NAME="124"></A>Opinions were expressed by some to the effect that commissioners should 
<A NAME="125"></A>be sent to Caesar to acquaint him with the senate's 
<A NAME="126"></A>pleasure.
<A NAME="127"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 4</B>
<A NAME="128"></A><BR><BR>All these proposals were rejected, and opposition made to them 
<A NAME="129"></A>all, in the speeches of the consul, Scipio, and Cato. An old grudge against 
<A NAME="130"></A>Caesar and chagrin at a defeat actuated Cato. Lentulus was wrought upon 
<A NAME="131"></A>by the magnitude of his debts, and the hopes of having the government of 
<A NAME="132"></A>an army and provinces, and by the presents which he expected from such 
<A NAME="133"></A>princes as should receive the title of friends of the Roman people, and 
<A NAME="134"></A>boasted among his friends, that he would be a second Sylla, to whom the 
<A NAME="135"></A>supreme authority should return. Similar hopes of a province and armies, 
<A NAME="136"></A>which he expected to share with Pompey on account of his connection with 
<A NAME="137"></A>him, urged on Scipio; and moreover [he was influenced by] the fear of being 
<A NAME="138"></A>called to trial, and the adulation and an ostentatious display of himself 
<A NAME="139"></A>and his friends in power, who at that time had great influence in the republic, 
<A NAME="140"></A>and courts of judicature. Pompey himself, incited by Caesar's enemies, 
<A NAME="141"></A>because he was unwilling that any person should bear an equal degree of 
<A NAME="142"></A>dignity, had wholly alienated himself from Caesar's friendship, and procured 
<A NAME="143"></A>a reconciliation with their common enemies; the greatest part of whom he 
<A NAME="144"></A>had himself brought upon Caesar during his affinity with him. At the same 
<A NAME="145"></A>time, chagrined at the disgrace which he had incurred by converting the 
<A NAME="146"></A>two legions from their expedition through Asia and Syria, to [augment] 
<A NAME="147"></A>his own power and authority, he was anxious to bring matters to a 
<A NAME="148"></A>war.
<A NAME="149"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 5</B>
<A NAME="150"></A><BR><BR>For these reasons every thing was done in a hasty and disorderly 
<A NAME="151"></A>manner, and neither was time given to Caesar's relations to inform him 
<A NAME="152"></A>[of the state of affairs] nor liberty to the tribunes of the people to 
<A NAME="153"></A>deprecate their own danger, nor even to retain the last privilege, which 
<A NAME="154"></A>Sylla had left them, the interposing their authority; but on the seventh 
<A NAME="155"></A>day they were obliged to think of their own safety, which the most turbulent 
<A NAME="156"></A>tribunes of the people were not accustomed to attend to, nor to fear being 
<A NAME="157"></A>called to an account for their actions, till the eighth month. Recourse 
<A NAME="158"></A>is had to that extreme and final decree of the senate (which was never 
<A NAME="159"></A>resorted to even by daring proposers except when the city was in danger 
<A NAME="160"></A>of being set on fire, or when the public safety was despaired of). "That 
<A NAME="161"></A>the consuls, praetors, tribunes of the people, and proconsuls in the city, 
<A NAME="162"></A>should take care that the state received no injury." These decrees are 
<A NAME="163"></A>dated the eighth day before the ides of January; therefore, in the first 
<A NAME="164"></A>five days, on which the senate could meet, from the day on which Lentulus 
<A NAME="165"></A>entered into his consulate, the two days of election excepted, the severest 
<A NAME="166"></A>and most virulent decrees were passed against Caesar's government, and 
<A NAME="167"></A>against those most illustrious characters, the tribunes of the people. 
<A NAME="168"></A>The latter immediately made their escape from the city, and withdrew to 
<A NAME="169"></A>Caesar, who was then at Ravenna, awaiting an answer to his moderate demands; 
<A NAME="170"></A>[to see] if matters could be brought to a peaceful termination by any equitable 
<A NAME="171"></A>act on the part of his enemies.
<A NAME="172"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 6</B>
<A NAME="173"></A><BR><BR>During the succeeding days the senate is convened outside the city. 
<A NAME="174"></A>Pompey repeated the same things which he had declared through Scipio. He 
<A NAME="175"></A>applauded the courage and firmness of the senate, acquainted them with 
<A NAME="176"></A>his force, and told them that he had ten legions ready; that he was moreover 
<A NAME="177"></A>informed and assured that Caesar's soldiers were disaffected, and that 
<A NAME="178"></A>he could not persuade them to defend or even follow him. Motions were made 
<A NAME="179"></A>in the senate concerning other matters; that levies should be made through 
<A NAME="180"></A>all Italy; that Faustus Sylla should be sent as propraetor into Mauritania; 
<A NAME="181"></A>that money should be granted to Pompey from the public treasury. It was 
<A NAME="182"></A>also put to the vote that king Juba should be [honored with the title of] 
<A NAME="183"></A>friend and ally. But Marcellus said that he would not allow this motion 
<A NAME="184"></A>for the present. Philip, one of the tribunes, stopped [the appointment 
<A NAME="185"></A>of] Sylla; the resolutions respecting the other matters passed. The provinces, 
<A NAME="186"></A>two of which were consular, the remainder praetorian, were decreed to private 
<A NAME="187"></A>persons; Scipio got Syria, Lucius Domitius Gaul: Philip and Marcellus were 
<A NAME="188"></A>omitted, from a private motive, and their lots were not even admitted. 
<A NAME="189"></A>To the other provinces praetors were sent, nor was time granted as in former 
<A NAME="190"></A>years, to refer to the people on their appointment, nor to make them take 
<A NAME="191"></A>the usual oath, and march out of the city in a public manner, robed in 
<A NAME="192"></A>the military habit, after offering their vows: a circumstance which had 
<A NAME="193"></A>never before happened. Both the consuls leave the city, and private men 
<A NAME="194"></A>had lictors in the city and capital, contrary to all precedents of former 
<A NAME="195"></A>times. Levies were made throughout Italy, arms demanded, and money exacted 
<A NAME="196"></A>from the municipal towns, and violently taken from the temples. All distinctions 
<A NAME="197"></A>between things human and divine, are confounded.
<A NAME="198"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 7</B>
<A NAME="199"></A><BR><BR>These things being made known to Caesar, he harangued his soldiers; 
<A NAME="200"></A>he reminded them "of the wrongs done to him at all times by his enemies, 
<A NAME="201"></A>and complained that Pompey had been alienated from him and led astray by 
<A NAME="202"></A>them through envy and a malicious opposition to his glory, though he had 
<A NAME="203"></A>always favored and promoted Pompey's honor and dignity. He complained that 
<A NAME="204"></A>an innovation had been introduced into the republic, that the intercession 
<A NAME="205"></A>of the tribunes, which had been restored a few years before by Sylla, was 
<A NAME="206"></A>branded as a crime, and suppressed by force of arms; that Sylla, who had 
<A NAME="207"></A>stripped the tribunes of every other power, had, nevertheless, left the 
<A NAME="208"></A>privilege of intercession unrestrained; that Pompey, who pretended to restore 
<A NAME="209"></A>what they had lost, had taken away the privileges which they formerly had; 
<A NAME="210"></A>that whenever the senate decreed, 'that the magistrates should take care 
<A NAME="211"></A>that the republic sustained no injury' (by which words and decree the Roman 
<A NAME="212"></A>people were obliged to repair to arms), it was only when pernicious laws 
<A NAME="213"></A>were proposed; when the tribunes attempted violent measures; when the people 
<A NAME="214"></A>seceded, and possessed themselves of the temples and eminences of the city; 
<A NAME="215"></A>(and these instances of former times, he showed them were expiated by the 
<A NAME="216"></A>fate of Saturninus and the Gracchi): that nothing of this kind was attempted 
<A NAME="217"></A>now, nor even thought of: that no law was promulgated, no intrigue with 
<A NAME="218"></A>the people going forward, no secession made; he exhorted them to defend 
<A NAME="219"></A>from the malice of his enemies the reputation and honor of that general 
<A NAME="220"></A>under whose command they had for nine years most successfully supported 
<A NAME="221"></A>the state; fought many successful battles, and subdued all Gaul and Germany." 
<A NAME="222"></A>The soldiers of the thirteenth legion, which was present (for in the beginning 
<A NAME="223"></A>of the disturbances he had called it out, his other legions not having 
<A NAME="224"></A>yet arrived), all cry out that they are ready to defend their general, 
<A NAME="225"></A>and the tribunes of the commons, from all injuries.
<A NAME="226"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 8</B>
<A NAME="227"></A><BR><BR>Having made himself acquainted with the disposition of his soldiers, 
<A NAME="228"></A>Caesar set off with that legion to Ariminum, and there met the tribunes, 
<A NAME="229"></A>who had fled to him for protection; he called his other legions from winter 
<A NAME="230"></A>quarters; and ordered them to follow him. Thither came Lucius Caesar, a 
<A NAME="231"></A>young man, whose father was a lieutenant-general under Caesar. He, after 
<A NAME="232"></A>concluding the rest of his speech, and stating for what purpose he had 
<A NAME="233"></A>come, told Caesar that he had commands of a private nature for him from 
<A NAME="234"></A>Pompey; that Pompey wished to clear himself to Caesar, lest he should impute 
<A NAME="235"></A>those actions which he did for the republic, to a design of affronting 
<A NAME="236"></A>him; that he had ever preferred the interest of the state to his own private 
<A NAME="237"></A>connections; that Caesar, too, for his own honor, ought to sacrifice his 
<A NAME="238"></A>desires and resentment to the public good, and not vent his anger so violently 
<A NAME="239"></A>against his enemies, lest in his hopes of injuring them, he should injure 
<A NAME="240"></A>the republic. He spoke a few words to the same purport from himself, in 
<A NAME="241"></A>addition to Pompey's apology. Roscius, the praetor, conferred with Caesar 
<A NAME="242"></A>almost in the same words, and on the same subject, and declared that Pompey 
<A NAME="243"></A>had empowered him to do so.
<A NAME="244"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 9</B>
<A NAME="245"></A><BR><BR>Though these things seemed to have no tendency toward redressing 
<A NAME="246"></A>his injuries, yet having got proper persons by whom he could communicate 
<A NAME="247"></A>his wishes to Pompey; he required of them both, that, as they had conveyed 
<A NAME="248"></A>Pompey's demands to him, they should not refuse to convey his demands to 
<A NAME="249"></A>Pompey; if by so little trouble they could terminate a great dispute, and 
<A NAME="250"></A>liberate all Italy from her fears. "That the honor of the republic had 
<A NAME="251"></A>ever been his first object, and dearer to him than life; that he was chagrined, 
<A NAME="252"></A>that the favor of the Roman people was wrested from him by the injurious 
<A NAME="253"></A>reports of his enemies; that he was deprived of a half-year's command, 
<A NAME="254"></A>and dragged back to the city, though the people had ordered that regard 
<A NAME="255"></A>should be paid to his suit for the consulate at the next election, though 
<A NAME="256"></A>he was not present; that, however, he had patiently submitted to this loss 
<A NAME="257"></A>of honor, for the sake of the republic; that when he wrote letters to the 
<A NAME="258"></A>senate, requiring that all persons should resign the command of their armies, 
<A NAME="259"></A>he did not obtain even that request; that levies were made throughout Italy; 
<A NAME="260"></A>that the two legions which had been taken from him, under the pretense 
<A NAME="261"></A>of the Parthian war, were kept at home, and that the state was in arms. 
<A NAME="262"></A>To what did all these things tend, unless to his ruin? But, nevertheless, 
<A NAME="263"></A>he was ready to condescend to any terms, and to endure every thing for 
<A NAME="264"></A>the sake of the republic. Let Pompey go to his own province; let them both 
<A NAME="265"></A>disband their armies; let all persons in Italy lay down their arms; let 
<A NAME="266"></A>all fears be removed from the city; let free elections, and the whole republic 
<A NAME="267"></A>be resigned to the direction of the senate and Roman people. That these 
<A NAME="268"></A>things might be the more easily performed, and conditions secured and confirmed 
<A NAME="269"></A>by oath, either let Pompey come to Caesar, or allow Caesar to go to him; 
<A NAME="270"></A>it might be that all their disputes would be settled by an 
<A NAME="271"></A>interview."
<A NAME="272"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 10</B>
<A NAME="273"></A><BR><BR>Roscius and Lucius Caesar, having received this message, went to 
<A NAME="274"></A>Capua, where they met the consuls and Pompey, and declared to them Caesar's 
<A NAME="275"></A>terms. Having deliberated on the matter, they replied, and sent written 
<A NAME="276"></A>proposals to him by the same persons, the purport of which was, that Caesar 
<A NAME="277"></A>should return into Gaul, leave Ariminum, and disband his army: if he complied 
<A NAME="278"></A>with this, that Pompey would go to Spain. In the mean time, until security 
<A NAME="279"></A>was given that Caesar would perform his promises, that the consuls and 
<A NAME="280"></A>Pompey would not give over their levies.
<A NAME="281"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 11</B>
<A NAME="282"></A><BR><BR>It was not an equitable proposal, to require that Caesar should 
<A NAME="283"></A>quit Ariminum and return to his province; but that he [Pompey] should himself 
<A NAME="284"></A>retain his province and the legions that belonged to another, and desire 
<A NAME="285"></A>that Caesar's army should be disbanded, while he himself was making new 
<A NAME="286"></A>levies: and that he should merely promise to go to his province, without 
<A NAME="287"></A>naming the day on which he would set out; so that if he should not set 
<A NAME="288"></A>out till after Caesar's consulate expired, yet he would not appear bound 
<A NAME="289"></A>by any religious scruples about asserting a falsehood. But his not granting 
<A NAME="290"></A>time for a conference, nor promising to set out to meet him, made the expectation 
<A NAME="291"></A>of peace appear very hopeless. Caesar, therefore, sent Marcus Antonius, 
<A NAME="292"></A>with five cohorts from Ariminum to Arretium; he himself staid at Ariminum 
<A NAME="293"></A>with two legions, with the intention of raising levies there. He secured 
<A NAME="294"></A>Pisaurus, Fanum, and Ancona, with a cohort each.
<A NAME="295"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 12</B>
<A NAME="296"></A><BR><BR>In the mean time, being informed that Thermus the praetor was in 
<A NAME="297"></A>possession of Iguvium, with five cohorts, and was fortifying the town, 
<A NAME="298"></A>but that the affections of all the inhabitants were very well inclined 
<A NAME="299"></A>toward himself, he detached Curio with three cohorts, which he had at Ariminum 
<A NAME="300"></A>and Pisaurus. Upon notice of his approach, Thermus, distrusting the affections 
<A NAME="301"></A>of the townsmen, drew his cohorts out of it and made his escape; his soldiers 
<A NAME="302"></A>deserted him on the road, and returned home. Curio recovered Iguvium, with 
<A NAME="303"></A>the cheerful concurrence of all the inhabitants. Caesar, having received 
<A NAME="304"></A>an account of this, and relying on the affections of the municipal towns, 
<A NAME="305"></A>drafted all the cohorts of the thirteenth legion from the garrison, and 
<A NAME="306"></A>set out for Auximum, a town into which Attius had brought his cohorts, 
<A NAME="307"></A>and of which he had taken possession, and from which he had sent senators 
<A NAME="308"></A>round about the country of Picenum, to raise new levies.
<A NAME="309"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 13</B>
<A NAME="310"></A><BR><BR>Upon news of Caesar's approach, the senate of Auximum went in a 
<A NAME="311"></A>body to Attius Varus; and told him that it was not a subject for them to 
<A NAME="312"></A>determine upon: yet neither they, nor the rest of the freemen would suffer 
<A NAME="313"></A>Caius Caesar, a general, who had merited so well of the republic, after 
<A NAME="314"></A>performing such great achievements, to be excluded from their town and 
<A NAME="315"></A>walls; wherefore he ought to pay some regard to the opinion of posterity, 
<A NAME="316"></A>and his own danger. Alarmed at this declaration, Attius Varus drew out 
<A NAME="317"></A>of the town the garrison which he had introduced, and fled. A fear of Caesar's 
<A NAME="318"></A>front rank having pursued him, obliged him to halt, and when the battle 
<A NAME="319"></A>began, Varus is deserted by his troops: some of them disperse to their 
<A NAME="320"></A>homes, the rest come over to Caesar; and along with them, Lucius Pupius, 
<A NAME="321"></A>the chief centurion, is taken prisoner and brought to Caesar. He had held 
<A NAME="322"></A>the same rank before in Cneius Pompey's army. But Caesar applauded the 
<A NAME="323"></A>soldiers of Attius, set Pupius at liberty, returned thanks to the people 
<A NAME="324"></A>of Auximum, and promised to be grateful for their conduct.
<A NAME="325"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 14</B>
<A NAME="326"></A><BR><BR>Intelligence of this being brought to Rome, so great a panic spread 
<A NAME="327"></A>on a sudden that when Lentulus, the consul, came to open the treasury, 
<A NAME="328"></A>to deliver money to Pompey by the senate's decree, immediately on opening 
<A NAME="329"></A>the hallowed door he fled from the city. For it was falsely rumored that 
<A NAME="330"></A>Caesar was approaching, and that his cavalry were already at the gates. 
<A NAME="331"></A>Marcellus, his colleague, followed him, and so did most of the magistrates. 
<A NAME="332"></A>Cneius Pompey had left the city the day before, and was on his march to 
<A NAME="333"></A>those legions which he had received from Caesar, and had disposed in winter 
<A NAME="334"></A>quarters in Apulia. The levies were stopped within the city. No place on 
<A NAME="335"></A>this side of Capua was thought secure. At Capua they first began to take 
<A NAME="336"></A>courage and to rally, and determined to raise levies in the colonies, which 
<A NAME="337"></A>had been sent thither by the Julian law: and Lentulus brought into the 
<A NAME="338"></A>public market place the gladiators which Caesar maintained there for the 
<A NAME="339"></A>entertainment of the people, and confirmed them in their liberty, and gave 
<A NAME="340"></A>them horses and ordered them to attend him; but afterward, being warned 
<A NAME="341"></A>by his friends that this action was censured by the judgment of all, he 
<A NAME="342"></A>distributed them among the slaves of the district of Campania, to keep 
<A NAME="343"></A>guard there.
<A NAME="344"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 15</B>
<A NAME="345"></A><BR><BR>Caesar, having moved forward from Auximum, traversed the whole 
<A NAME="346"></A>country of Picenum. All the governors in these countries most cheerfully 
<A NAME="347"></A>received him, and aided his army with every necessary. Embassadors came 
<A NAME="348"></A>to him even from Cingulum, a town which Labienus had laid out and built 
<A NAME="349"></A>at his own expense, and offered most earnestly to comply with his orders. 
<A NAME="350"></A>He demanded soldiers: they sent them. In the mean time, the twelfth legion 
<A NAME="351"></A>came to join Caesar; with these two he marched to Asculum, the chief town 
<A NAME="352"></A>of Picenum. Lentulus Spinther occupied that town with ten cohorts; but, 
<A NAME="353"></A>on being informed of Caesar's approach, he fled from the town, and, in 
<A NAME="354"></A>attempting to bring off his cohorts with him, was deserted by a great part 
<A NAME="355"></A>of his men. Being left on the road with a small number, he fell in with 
<A NAME="356"></A>Vibullius Rufus, who was sent by Pompey into Picenum to confirm the people 
<A NAME="357"></A>[in their allegiance]. Vibullius, being informed by him of the transactions 
<A NAME="358"></A>in Picenum, takes his soldiers from him and dismisses him. He collects, 
<A NAME="359"></A>likewise, from the neighboring countries, as many cohorts as he can from 
<A NAME="360"></A>Pompey's new levies. Among them he meets with Ulcilles Hirrus fleeing from 
<A NAME="361"></A>Camerinum, with six cohorts, which he had in the garrison there; by a junction 
<A NAME="362"></A>with which he made up thirteen cohorts. With them he marched by hasty journeys 
<A NAME="363"></A>to Corfinium, to Domitius Aenobarbus, and informed him that Caesar was 
<A NAME="364"></A>advancing with two legions. Domitius had collected about twenty cohorts 
<A NAME="365"></A>from Alba, and the Marsians, Pelignians, and neighboring 
<A NAME="366"></A>states.
<A NAME="367"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 16</B>
<A NAME="368"></A><BR><BR>Caesar, having recovered Asculum and driven out Lentulus, ordered 
<A NAME="369"></A>the soldiers that had deserted from him to be sought out and a muster to 
<A NAME="370"></A>be made; and, having delayed for one day there to provide corn, he marched 
<A NAME="371"></A>to Corfinium. On his approach, five cohorts, sent by Domitius from the 
<A NAME="372"></A>town, were breaking down a bridge which was over the river, at three miles' 
<A NAME="373"></A>distance from it. An engagement taking place there with Caesar's advanced-guard, 
<A NAME="374"></A>Domitius's men were quickly beaten off from the bridge and retreated precipitately 
<A NAME="375"></A>into the town. Caesar, having marched his legions over, halted before the 
<A NAME="376"></A>town and encamped close by the walls.
<A NAME="377"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 17</B>
<A NAME="378"></A><BR><BR>Domitius, upon observing this, sent messengers well acquainted 
<A NAME="379"></A>with the country, encouraged by a promise of being amply rewarded, with 
<A NAME="380"></A>dispatches to Pompey to Apulia, to beg and entreat him to come to his assistance. 
<A NAME="381"></A>That Caesar could be easily inclosed by the two armies, through the narrowness 
<A NAME="382"></A>of the country, and prevented from obtaining supplies: unless he did so, 
<A NAME="383"></A>that he and upward of thirty cohorts, and a great number of senators and 
<A NAME="384"></A>Roman knights, would be in extreme danger. In the mean time he encouraged 
<A NAME="385"></A>his troops, disposed engines on the walls, and assigned to each man a particular 
<A NAME="386"></A>part of the city to defend. In a speech to the soldiers he promised them 
<A NAME="387"></A>lands out of his own estate; to every private soldier four acres, and a 
<A NAME="388"></A>corresponding share to the centurions and veterans.
<A NAME="389"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 18</B>
<A NAME="390"></A><BR><BR>In the mean time, word was brought to Caesar that the people of 
<A NAME="391"></A>Sulmo, a town about seven miles distant from Corfinium, were ready to obey 
<A NAME="392"></A>his orders, but were prevented by Quintus Lucretius, a senator, and Attius, 
<A NAME="393"></A>a Pelignian, who were in possession of the town with a garrison of seven 
<A NAME="394"></A>cohorts. He sent Marcus Antonius thither, with five cohorts of the eighth 
<A NAME="395"></A>legion. The inhabitants, as soon as they saw our standards, threw open 
<A NAME="396"></A>their gates, and all the people, both citizens and soldiers, went out to 
<A NAME="397"></A>meet and welcome Antonius. Lucretius and Attius leaped off the walls. Attius, 
<A NAME="398"></A>being brought before Antonius, begged that he might be sent to Caesar. 
<A NAME="399"></A>Antonius returned the same day on which he had set out with the cohorts 
<A NAME="400"></A>and Attius. Caesar added these cohorts to his own army, and sent Attius 
<A NAME="401"></A>away in safety. The three first days Caesar employed in fortifying his 
<A NAME="402"></A>camp with strong works, in bringing in corn from the neighboring free towns, 
<A NAME="403"></A>and waiting for the rest of his forces. Within the three days the eighth 
<A NAME="404"></A>legion came to him, and twenty-two cohorts of the new levies in Gaul, and 
<A NAME="405"></A>about three hundred horse from the king of Noricum. On their arrival he 
<A NAME="406"></A>made a second camp on another part of the town, and gave the command of 
<A NAME="407"></A>it to Curio. He determined to surround the town with a rampart and turrets 
<A NAME="408"></A>during the remainder of the time. Nearly at the time when the greatest 
<A NAME="409"></A>part of the work was completed, all the messengers sent to Pompey 
<A NAME="410"></A>returned.
<A NAME="411"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 19</B>
<A NAME="412"></A><BR><BR>Having read Pompey's letter, Domitius, concealing the truth, gave 
<A NAME="413"></A>out in council that Pompey would speedily come to their assistance; and 
<A NAME="414"></A>encouraged them not to despond, but to provide every thing necessary for 
<A NAME="415"></A>the defense of the town. He held private conferences with a few of his 
<A NAME="416"></A>most intimate friends, and determined on the design of fleeing. As Domitius's 
<A NAME="417"></A>countenance did not agree with his words, and he did every thing with more 
<A NAME="418"></A>confusion and fear than he had shown on the preceding days, and as he had 
<A NAME="419"></A>several private meetings with his friends, contrary to his usual practice, 
<A NAME="420"></A>in order to take their advice, and as he avoided all public councils and 
<A NAME="421"></A>assemblies of the people, the truth could be no longer hid nor dissembled; 
<A NAME="422"></A>for Pompey had written back in answer, "That he would not put matters to 
<A NAME="423"></A>the last hazard; that Domitius had retreated into the town of Corfinium 
<A NAME="424"></A>without either his advice or consent. Therefore, if any opportunity should 
<A NAME="425"></A>offer, he [Domitius] should come to him with the whole force." But the 
<A NAME="426"></A>blockade and works round the town prevented his escape.
<A NAME="427"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 20</B>
<A NAME="428"></A><BR><BR>Domitius's design being noised abroad, the soldiers in Corfinium 
<A NAME="429"></A>early in the evening began to mutiny, and held a conference with each other 
<A NAME="430"></A>by their tribunes and centurions, and the most respectable among themselves: 
<A NAME="431"></A>"that they were besieged by Caesar; that his works and fortifications were 
<A NAME="432"></A>almost finished; that their general, Domitius, on whose hopes and expectations 
<A NAME="433"></A>they had confided, had thrown them off, and was meditating his own escape; 
<A NAME="434"></A>that they ought to provide for their own safety." At first the Marsians 
<A NAME="435"></A>differed in opinion, and possessed themselves of that part of the town 
<A NAME="436"></A>which they thought the strongest. And so violent a dispute arose between 
<A NAME="437"></A>them, that they attempted to fight and decide it by arms. However, in a 
<A NAME="438"></A>little time, by messengers sent from one side to the other, they were informed 
<A NAME="439"></A>of Domitius's meditated flight, of which they were previously ignorant. 
<A NAME="440"></A>Therefore they all with one consent brought Domitius into public view, 
<A NAME="441"></A>gathered round him, and guarded him; and sent deputies out of their number 
<A NAME="442"></A>to Caesar, to say that they were ready to throw open their gates, to do 
<A NAME="443"></A>whatever he should order, and deliver up Domitius alive into his 
<A NAME="444"></A>hands."
<A NAME="445"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 21</B>
<A NAME="446"></A><BR><BR>Upon intelligence of these matters, though Caesar thought it of 
<A NAME="447"></A>great consequence to become master of the town as soon as possible, and 
<A NAME="448"></A>to transfer the cohorts to his own camp, lest any change should be wrought 
<A NAME="449"></A>on their inclinations by bribes, encouragement, or ficticious messages, 
<A NAME="450"></A>because in war great events are often brought about by trifling circumstances; 
<A NAME="451"></A>yet, dreading lest the town should be plundered by the soldiers entering 
<A NAME="452"></A>into it, and taking advantage of the darkness of the night, he commended 
<A NAME="453"></A>the persons who came to him, and sent them back to the town, and ordered 
<A NAME="454"></A>the gates and walls to be secured. He disposed his soldiers on the works 
<A NAME="455"></A>which he had begun, not at certain intervals, as was his practice before, 
<A NAME="456"></A>but in one continued range of sentinels and stations, so that they touched 
<A NAME="457"></A>each other, and formed a circle round the whole fortification; he ordered 
<A NAME="458"></A>the tribunes and general officers to ride round; and exhorted them not 
<A NAME="459"></A>only to be on their guard against sallies from the town, but also to watch 
<A NAME="460"></A>that no single person should get out privately. Nor was any man so negligent 
<A NAME="461"></A>or drowsy as to sleep that night. To so great height was their expectation 
<A NAME="462"></A>raised, that they were carried away, heart and soul, each to different 
<A NAME="463"></A>objects, what would become of the Corfinians, what of Domitius, what of 
<A NAME="464"></A>Lentulus, what of the rest; what event would be the consequence of 
<A NAME="465"></A>another.
<A NAME="466"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 22</B>
<A NAME="467"></A><BR><BR>About the fourth watch, Lentulus Spinther said to our sentinels 
<A NAME="468"></A>and guards from the walls, that he desired to have an interview with Caesar, 
<A NAME="469"></A>if permission were given him. Having obtained it, he was escorted out of 
<A NAME="470"></A>town; nor did the soldiers of Domitius leave him till they brought him 
<A NAME="471"></A>into Caesar's presence. He pleaded with Caesar for his life, and entreated 
<A NAME="472"></A>him to spare him, and reminded him of their former friendship; and acknowledged 
<A NAME="473"></A>that Caesar's favors to him were very great; in that through his interest 
<A NAME="474"></A>he had been admitted into the college of priests; in that after his praetorship 
<A NAME="475"></A>he had been appointed to the government of Spain; in that he had been assisted 
<A NAME="476"></A>by him in his suit for the consulate. Caesar interrupted him in his speech, 
<A NAME="477"></A>and told him, "that he had not left his province to do mischief [to any 
<A NAME="478"></A>man], but to protect himself from the injuries of his enemies; to restore 
<A NAME="479"></A>to their dignity the tribunes of the people who had been driven out of 
<A NAME="480"></A>the city on his account, and to assert his own liberty, and that of the 
<A NAME="481"></A>Roman people, who were oppressed by a few factious men. Encouraged by this 
<A NAME="482"></A>address, Lentulus begged leave to return to the town, that the security 
<A NAME="483"></A>which he had obtained for himself might be an encouragement to the rest 
<A NAME="484"></A>to hope for theirs; saying that some were so terrified that they were induced 
<A NAME="485"></A>to make desperate attempts on their own lives. Leave being granted him, 
<A NAME="486"></A>he departed.
<A NAME="487"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 23</B>
<A NAME="488"></A><BR><BR>When day appeared, Caesar ordered all the senators and their children, 
<A NAME="489"></A>the tribunes of the soldiers, and the Roman knights to be brought before 
<A NAME="490"></A>him. Among the persons of senatorial rank were Lucius Domitius, Publius 
<A NAME="491"></A>Lentulus Spinther, Lucius Vibullius Rufus, Sextus Quintilius Varus, the 
<A NAME="492"></A>quaestor, and Lucius Rubrius, besides the son of Domitius, and several 
<A NAME="493"></A>other young men, and a great number of Roman knights and burgesses, whom 
<A NAME="494"></A>Domitius had summoned from the municipal towns. When they were brought 
<A NAME="495"></A>before him he protected them from the insolence and taunts of the soldiers; 
<A NAME="496"></A>told them in few words that they had not made him a grateful return, on 
<A NAME="497"></A>their part, for his very extraordinary kindness to them, and dismissed 
<A NAME="498"></A>them all in safety. Sixty sestertia, which Domitius had brought with him 
<A NAME="499"></A>and lodged in the public treasury, being brought to Caesar by the magistrates 
<A NAME="500"></A>of Corfinium, he gave them back to Domitius, that he might not appear more 
<A NAME="501"></A>moderate with respect to the life of men than in money matters, though 
<A NAME="502"></A>he knew that it was public money, and had been given by Pompey to pay his 
<A NAME="503"></A>army. He ordered Domitius's soldiers to take the oath to himself, and that 
<A NAME="504"></A>day decamped and performed the regular march. He staid only seven days 
<A NAME="505"></A>before Corfinium, and marched into Apulia through the country of the Marrucinians, 
<A NAME="506"></A>Frentanian's and Larinates.
<A NAME="507"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 24</B>
<A NAME="508"></A><BR><BR>Pompey, being informed of what had passed at Corfinium, marches 
<A NAME="509"></A>from Luceria to Canusium, and thence to Brundusium. He orders all the forces 
<A NAME="510"></A>raised every where by the new levies to repair to him. He gives arms to 
<A NAME="511"></A>the slaves that attended the flocks, and appoints horses for them. Of these 
<A NAME="512"></A>he made up about three hundred horse. Lucius, the praetor, fled from Alba, 
<A NAME="513"></A>with six cohorts: Rutilus, Lupus, the praetor, from Tarracina, with three. 
<A NAME="514"></A>These having descried Caesar's cavalry at a distance, which were commanded 
<A NAME="515"></A>by Bivius Curius, and having deserted the praetor, carried their colors 
<A NAME="516"></A>to Curius and went over to him. In like manner, during the rest of his 
<A NAME="517"></A>march, several cohorts fell in with the main body of Caesar's army, others 
<A NAME="518"></A>with his horse. Cneius Magius, from Cremona, engineer-general to Pompey, 
<A NAME="519"></A>was taken prisoner on the road and brought to Caesar, but sent back by 
<A NAME="520"></A>him to Pompey with this message: "As hitherto he had not been allowed an 
<A NAME="521"></A>interview, and was now on his march to him at Brundusium, that it deeply 
<A NAME="522"></A>concerned the commonwealth and general safety that he should have an interview 
<A NAME="523"></A>with Pompey; and that the same advantage could not be gained at a great 
<A NAME="524"></A>distance when the proposals were conveyed to them by others, as if terms 
<A NAME="525"></A>were argued by them both in person."
<A NAME="526"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 25</B>
<A NAME="527"></A><BR><BR>Having delivered this message he marched to Brundusium with six 
<A NAME="528"></A>legions, four of them veterans: the rest those which he had raised in the 
<A NAME="529"></A>late levy and completed on his march, for he had sent all Domitius's cohorts 
<A NAME="530"></A>immediately from Corfinium to Sicily. He discovered that the consuls were 
<A NAME="531"></A>gone to Dyrrachium with a considerable part of the army, and that Pompey 
<A NAME="532"></A>remained at Brundusium with twenty cohorts; but could not find out, for 
<A NAME="533"></A>a certainty, whether Pompey staid behind to keep possession of Brundusium, 
<A NAME="534"></A>that he might the more easily command the whole Adriatic sea, with the 
<A NAME="535"></A>extremities of Italy and the coast of Greece, and be able to conduct the 
<A NAME="536"></A>war on either side of it, or whether he remained there for want of shipping; 
<A NAME="537"></A>and, being afraid that Pompey would come to the conclusion that he ought 
<A NAME="538"></A>not to relinquish Italy, he determined to deprive him of the means of communication 
<A NAME="539"></A>afforded by the harbor of Brundusium. The plan of his work was as follows: 
<A NAME="540"></A>Where the mouth of the port was narrowest he threw up a mole of earth on 
<A NAME="541"></A>either side, because in these places the sea was shallow. Having gone out 
<A NAME="542"></A>so far that the mole could not be continued in the deep water, he fixed 
<A NAME="543"></A>double floats, thirty feet on either side, before the mole. These he fastened 
<A NAME="544"></A>with four anchors at the four corners, that they might not be carried away 
<A NAME="545"></A>by the waves. Having completed and secured them, he then joined to them 
<A NAME="546"></A>other floats of equal size. These he covered over with earth and mold, 
<A NAME="547"></A>that he might not be prevented from access to them to defend them, and 
<A NAME="548"></A>in the front and on both sides he protected them with a parapet of wicker 
<A NAME="549"></A>work; and on every fourth one raised a turret, two stories high, to secure 
<A NAME="550"></A>them the better from being attacked by the shipping and set on 
<A NAME="551"></A>fire.
<A NAME="552"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 26</B>
<A NAME="553"></A><BR><BR>To counteract this, Pompey fitted out large merchant ships, which 
<A NAME="554"></A>he found in the harbor of Brundusium: on them he erected turrets three 
<A NAME="555"></A>stories high, and, having furnished them with several engines and all sorts 
<A NAME="556"></A>of weapons, drove them among Caesar's works, to break through the floats 
<A NAME="557"></A>and interrupt the works; thus there happened skirmishes every day at a 
<A NAME="558"></A>distance with slings, arrows, and other weapons. Caesar conducted matters 
<A NAME="559"></A>as if he thought that the hopes of peace were not yet to be given up. And 
<A NAME="560"></A>though he was very much surprised that Magius, whom he had sent to Pompey 
<A NAME="561"></A>with a message, was not sent back to him; and though his attempting a reconciliation 
<A NAME="562"></A>often retarded the vigorous prosecution of his plans, yet he thought that 
<A NAME="563"></A>he ought by all means to persevere in the same line of conduct. He therefore 
<A NAME="564"></A>sent Caninius Rebilus to have an interview with Scribonius Libo, his intimate 
<A NAME="565"></A>friend and relation. He charges him to exhort Libo to effect a peace, but, 
<A NAME="566"></A>above all things, requires that he should be admitted to an interview with 
<A NAME="567"></A>Pompey. He declared that he had great hopes, if that were allowed him, 
<A NAME="568"></A>that the consequence would be that both parties would lay down their arms 
<A NAME="569"></A>on equal terms; that a great share of the glory and reputation of that 
<A NAME="570"></A>event would redound to Libo, if, through his advice and agency, hostilities 
<A NAME="571"></A>should be ended. Libo, having parted from the conference with Caninius, 
<A NAME="572"></A>went to Pompey, and, shortly after, returns with answer that, as the consuls 
<A NAME="573"></A>were absent, no treaty of composition could be engaged in without them. 
<A NAME="574"></A>Caesar therefore thought it time at length to give over the attempt which 
<A NAME="575"></A>he had often made in vain, and act with energy in the 
<A NAME="576"></A>war.
<A NAME="577"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 27</B>
<A NAME="578"></A><BR><BR>When Caesar's works were nearly half finished, and after nine days 
<A NAME="579"></A>were spent in them, the ships which had conveyed the first division of 
<A NAME="580"></A>the army to Dyrrachium being sent back by the consuls, returned to Brundusium. 
<A NAME="581"></A>Pompey, either frightened at Caesar's works or determined from the beginning 
<A NAME="582"></A>to quit Italy, began to prepare for his departure on the arrival of the 
<A NAME="583"></A>ships; and the more effectually to retard Caesar's attack, lest his soldiers 
<A NAME="584"></A>should force their way into the town at the moment of his departure, he 
<A NAME="585"></A>stopped up the gates, built walls across the streets and avenues, sunk 
<A NAME="586"></A>trenches across the ways, and in them fixed palisadoes and sharp stakes, 
<A NAME="587"></A>which he made level with the ground by means of hurdles and clay. But he 
<A NAME="588"></A>barricaded with large beams fastened in the ground and sharpened at the 
<A NAME="589"></A>ends two passages and roads without the walls, which led to the port. After 
<A NAME="590"></A>making these arrangements, he ordered his soldiers to go on board without 
<A NAME="591"></A>noise, and disposed here and there, on the wall and turrets, some light-armed 
<A NAME="592"></A>veterans, archers and slingers. These he designed to call off by a certain 
<A NAME="593"></A>signal, when all the soldiers were embarked, and left row-galleys for them 
<A NAME="594"></A>in a secure place.
<A NAME="595"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 28</B>
<A NAME="596"></A><BR><BR>The people of Brundusium, irritated by the insolence of Pompey's 
<A NAME="597"></A>soldiers, and the insults received from Pompey himself, were in favor of 
<A NAME="598"></A>Caesar's party. Therefore, as soon as they were aware of Pompey's departure, 
<A NAME="599"></A>while his men were running up and down, and busied about their voyage, 
<A NAME="600"></A>they made signs from the tops of the houses: Caesar, being apprised of 
<A NAME="601"></A>the design by them, ordered scaling-ladders to be got ready, and his men 
<A NAME="602"></A>to take arms, that he might not lose any opportunity of coming to an action. 
<A NAME="603"></A>Pompey weighed anchor at nightfall. The soldiers who had been posted on 
<A NAME="604"></A>the wall to guard it, were called off by the signal which had been agreed 
<A NAME="605"></A>on, and knowing the roads, ran down to the ships. Caesar's soldiers fixed 
<A NAME="606"></A>their ladders and scaled the walls: but being cautioned by the people to 
<A NAME="607"></A>beware of the hidden stakes and covered trenches, they halted, and being 
<A NAME="608"></A>conducted by the inhabitants by a long circuit, they reached the port, 
<A NAME="609"></A>and captured with their long boats and small craft two of Pompey's ships, 
<A NAME="610"></A>full of soldiers, which had struck against Caesar's 
<A NAME="611"></A>moles.
<A NAME="612"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 29</B>
<A NAME="613"></A><BR><BR>Though Caesar highly approved of collecting a fleet, and crossing 
<A NAME="614"></A>the sea, and pursuing Pompey before he could strengthen himself with his 
<A NAME="615"></A>transmarine auxiliaries, with the hope of bringing the war to a conclusion, 
<A NAME="616"></A>yet he dreaded the delay and length of time necessary to effect it: because 
<A NAME="617"></A>Pompey, by collecting all his ships, had deprived him of the means of pursuing 
<A NAME="618"></A>him at present. The only resource left to Caesar, was to wait for a fleet 
<A NAME="619"></A>from the distant regions of Gaul, Picenum, and the straits of Gibraltar. 
<A NAME="620"></A>But this, on account of the season of the year, appeared tedious and troublesome. 
<A NAME="621"></A>He was unwilling that, in the mean time, the veteran army, and the two 
<A NAME="622"></A>Spains, one of which was bound to Pompey by the strongest obligations, 
<A NAME="623"></A>should be confirmed in his interest; that auxiliaries and cavalry should 
<A NAME="624"></A>be provided, and Gaul and Italy reduced in his absence.
<A NAME="625"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 30</B>
<A NAME="626"></A><BR><BR>Therefore, for the present he relinquished all intention of pursuing 
<A NAME="627"></A>Pompey, and resolved to march to Spain, and commanded the magistrates of 
<A NAME="628"></A>the free towns to procure him ships, and to have them convoyed to Brundusium. 
<A NAME="629"></A>He detached Valerius, his lieutenant, with one legion to Sardinia; Curio, 
<A NAME="630"></A>the propraetor, to Sicily with three legions; and ordered him, when he 
<A NAME="631"></A>had recovered Sicily, to immediately transport his army to Africa. Marcus 
<A NAME="632"></A>Cotta was at this time governor of Sardinia: Marcus Cato, of Sicily: and 
<A NAME="633"></A>Tubero, by the lots, should have had the government of Africa. The Caralitani, 
<A NAME="634"></A>as soon as they heard that Valerius was sent against them, even before 
<A NAME="635"></A>he left Italy, of their own accord drove Cotta out of the town; who, terrified 
<A NAME="636"></A>because he understood that the whole province was combined [against him], 
<A NAME="637"></A>fled from Sardinia to Africa. Cato was in Sicily, repairing the old ships 
<A NAME="638"></A>of war, and demanding new ones from the states, and these things he performed 
<A NAME="639"></A>with great zeal. He was raising levies of Roman citizens, among the Lucani 
<A NAME="640"></A>and Brutii, by his lieutenants, and exacting a certain quota of horse and 
<A NAME="641"></A>foot from the states of Sicily. When these things were nearly completed, 
<A NAME="642"></A>being informed of Curio's approach, he made a complaint that he was abandoned 
<A NAME="643"></A>and betrayed by Pompey, who had undertaken an unnecessary war, without 
<A NAME="644"></A>making any preparation, and when questioned by him and other members in 
<A NAME="645"></A>the senate, had assured them that every thing was ready and provided for 
<A NAME="646"></A>the war. After having made these complaints in a public assembly, he fled 
<A NAME="647"></A>from his province.
<A NAME="648"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 31</B>
<A NAME="649"></A><BR><BR>Valerius found Sardinia, and Curio, Sicily, deserted by their governors 
<A NAME="650"></A>when they arrived there with their armies. When Tubero arrived in Africa, 
<A NAME="651"></A>he found Attius Varus in the government of the province, who, having lost 
<A NAME="652"></A>his cohorts, as already related, at Auximum, had straightway fled to Africa, 
<A NAME="653"></A>and finding it without a governor, had seized it of his own accord, and 
<A NAME="654"></A>making levies, had raised two legions. From his acquaintance with the people 
<A NAME="655"></A>and country, and his knowledge of that province, he found the means of 
<A NAME="656"></A>effecting this; because a few years before, at the expiration of his praetorship, 
<A NAME="657"></A>he had obtained that province. He, when Tubero came to Utica with his fleet, 
<A NAME="658"></A>prevented his entering the port or town, and did not suffer his son, though 
<A NAME="659"></A>laboring under sickness, to set foot on shore; but obliged him to weigh 
<A NAME="660"></A>anchor and quit the place.
<A NAME="661"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 32</B>
<A NAME="662"></A><BR><BR>When these affairs were dispatched, Caesar, that there might be 
<A NAME="663"></A>an intermission from labor for the rest of the season, drew off his soldiers 
<A NAME="664"></A>to the nearest municipal towns, and set off in person for Rome. Having 
<A NAME="665"></A>assembled the senate, he reminded them of the injustice of his enemies; 
<A NAME="666"></A>and told them, "That he aimed at no extraordinary honor, but had waited 
<A NAME="667"></A>for the time appointed by law, for standing candidate for the consulate, 
<A NAME="668"></A>being contented with what was allowed to every citizen. That a bill had 
<A NAME="669"></A>been carried by the ten tribunes of the people (notwithstanding the resistance 
<A NAME="670"></A>of his enemies, and a very violent opposition from Cato, who in his usual 
<A NAME="671"></A>manner, consumed the day by a tedious harangue) that he should be allowed 
<A NAME="672"></A>to stand candidate, though absent, even in the consulship of Pompey; and 
<A NAME="673"></A>if the latter disapproved of the bill, why did he allow it to pass? if 
<A NAME="674"></A>he approved of it, why should he debar him [Caesar] from the people's favor? 
<A NAME="675"></A>He made mention of his own patience, in that he had freely proposed that 
<A NAME="676"></A>all armies should be disbanded, by which he himself would suffer the loss 
<A NAME="677"></A>both of dignity and honor. He urged the virulence of his enemies, who refused 
<A NAME="678"></A>to comply with what they required from others, and had rather that all 
<A NAME="679"></A>things should be thrown into confusion, than that they should lose their 
<A NAME="680"></A>power and their armies. He expatiated on their injustice, in taking away 
<A NAME="681"></A>his legions: their cruelty and insolence in abridging the privileges of 
<A NAME="682"></A>the tribunes; the proposals he had made, and his entreaties of an interview 
<A NAME="683"></A>which had been refused him. For which reasons, he begged and desired that 
<A NAME="684"></A>they would undertake the management of the republic, and unite with him 
<A NAME="685"></A>in the administration of it. But if through fear they declined it, he would 
<A NAME="686"></A>not be a burden to them, but take the management of it on himself. That 
<A NAME="687"></A>deputies ought to be sent to Pompey, to propose a reconciliation; as he 
<A NAME="688"></A>did not regard what Pompey had lately asserted in the senate, that authority 
<A NAME="689"></A>was acknowledged to be vested in those persons to whom embassadors were 
<A NAME="690"></A>sent, and fear implied in those that sent them. That these were the sentiments 
<A NAME="691"></A>of low, weak minds: that for his part, as he had made it his study to surpass 
<A NAME="692"></A>others in glory, so he was desirous of excelling them in justice and 
<A NAME="693"></A>equity."
<A NAME="694"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 33</B>
<A NAME="695"></A><BR><BR>The senate approved of sending deputies, but none could be found 
<A NAME="696"></A>fit to execute the commission: for every person, from his own private fears, 
<A NAME="697"></A>declined the office. For Pompey, on leaving the city, had declared in the 
<A NAME="698"></A>open senate, that he would hold in the same degree of estimation, those 
<A NAME="699"></A>who staid in Rome and those in Caesar's camp. Thus three days were wasted 
<A NAME="700"></A>in disputes and excuses. Besides, Lucius Metellus, one of the tribunes, 
<A NAME="701"></A>was suborned by Caesar's enemies, to prevent this, and to embarrass every 
<A NAME="702"></A>thing else which Caesar should propose. Caesar having discovered his intention, 
<A NAME="703"></A>after spending several days to no purpose, left the city, in order that 
<A NAME="704"></A>he might not lose any more time, and went to Transalpine Gaul, without 
<A NAME="705"></A>effecting what he had intended.
<A NAME="706"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 34</B>
<A NAME="707"></A><BR><BR>On his arrival there, he was informed that Vibullius Rufus, whom 
<A NAME="708"></A>he had taken a few days before at Corfinium, and set at liberty, was sent 
<A NAME="709"></A>by Pompey into Spain; and that Domitius also was gone to seize Massilia 
<A NAME="710"></A>with seven row-galleys, which were fitted up by some private persons at 
<A NAME="711"></A>Igilium and Cosa, and which he had manned with his own slaves, freedmen, 
<A NAME="712"></A>and colonists: and that some young noble men of Massilia had been sent 
<A NAME="713"></A>before him; whom Pompey, when leaving Rome had exhorted, that the late 
<A NAME="714"></A>services of Caesar should not erase from their minds the memory of his 
<A NAME="715"></A>former favors. On receiving this message, the Massilians had shut their 
<A NAME="716"></A>gates against Caesar, and invited over to them the Albici, who had formerly 
<A NAME="717"></A>been in alliance with them, and who inhabited the mountains that overhung 
<A NAME="718"></A>Massilia: they had likewise conveyed the corn from the surrounding country, 
<A NAME="719"></A>and from all the forts into the city; had opened armories in the city; 
<A NAME="720"></A>and were repairing the walls, the fleet, and the gates.
<A NAME="721"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 35</B>
<A NAME="722"></A><BR><BR>Caesar sent for fifteen of the principal persons of Massilia to 
<A NAME="723"></A>attend him. To prevent the war commencing among them, he remonstrates [in 
<A NAME="724"></A>the following language]; "that they ought to follow the precedent set by 
<A NAME="725"></A>all Italy, rather than submit to the will of any one man." He made use 
<A NAME="726"></A>of such arguments as he thought would tend to bring them to reason. The 
<A NAME="727"></A>deputies reported his speech to their countrymen, and by the authority 
<A NAME="728"></A>of the state bring him back this answer: "That they understood that the 
<A NAME="729"></A>Roman people was divided into two factions: that they had neither judgment 
<A NAME="730"></A>nor abilities to decide which had the juster cause; but that the heads 
<A NAME="731"></A>of these factions were Cneius Pompey and Caius Caesar, the two patrons 
<A NAME="732"></A>of the state: the former of whom had granted to their state the lands of 
<A NAME="733"></A>the Vocae Arecomici, and Helvii; the latter had assigned them a part of 
<A NAME="734"></A>his conquests in Gaul, and had augmented their revenue. Wherefore, having 
<A NAME="735"></A>received equal favors from both, they ought to show equal affection to 
<A NAME="736"></A>both, and assist neither against the other, nor admit either into their 
<A NAME="737"></A>city or harbors."
<A NAME="738"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 36</B>
<A NAME="739"></A><BR><BR>While this treaty was going forward, Domitius arrived at Massilia 
<A NAME="740"></A>with his fleet, and was received into the city, and made governor of it. 
<A NAME="741"></A>The chief management of the war was intrusted to him. At his command they 
<A NAME="742"></A>send the fleet to all parts; they seize all the merchantmen they could 
<A NAME="743"></A>meet with, and carry them into the harbor; they apply the nails, timber, 
<A NAME="744"></A>and rigging, with which they were furnished to rig and refit their other 
<A NAME="745"></A>vessels. They lay up in the public stores, all the corn that was found 
<A NAME="746"></A>in the ships, and reserve the rest of their lading and convoy for the siege 
<A NAME="747"></A>of the town, should such an event take place. Provoked at such ill treatment, 
<A NAME="748"></A>Caesar led three legions against Massilia, and resolved to provide turrets, 
<A NAME="749"></A>and vineae to assault the town, and to build twelve ships at Arelas, which 
<A NAME="750"></A>being completed and rigged in thirty days (from the time the timber was 
<A NAME="751"></A>cut down), and being brought to Massilia, he put under the command of Decimus 
<A NAME="752"></A>Brutus; and left Caius Trebonius his lieutenant, to invest the 
<A NAME="753"></A>city.
<A NAME="754"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 37</B>
<A NAME="755"></A><BR><BR>While he was preparing and getting these things in readiness, he 
<A NAME="756"></A>sent Caius Fabius one of his lieutenants into Spain with three legions, 
<A NAME="757"></A>which he had disposed to winter quarters in Narbo, and the neighboring 
<A NAME="758"></A>country; and ordered him immediately to seize the passes of the Pyrenees, 
<A NAME="759"></A>which were at that time occupied by detachments from Lucius Afranius, one 
<A NAME="760"></A>of Pompey's lieutenants. He desired the other legions, which were passing 
<A NAME="761"></A>the winter at a great distance, to follow close after him. Fabius, according 
<A NAME="762"></A>to his orders, by using expedition, dislodged the party from the hills, 
<A NAME="763"></A>and by hasty marches came up with the army of Afranius.
<A NAME="764"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 38</B>
<A NAME="765"></A><BR><BR>On the arrival of Vibullius Rufus, whom, we have already mentioned, 
<A NAME="766"></A>Pompey had sent into Spain, Afranius, Petreius, and Varro, his lieutenants 
<A NAME="767"></A>(one of whom had the command of Hither Spain, with three legions; the second 
<A NAME="768"></A>of the country from the forest of Castulo to the river Guadiana with two 
<A NAME="769"></A>legions; the third from the river Guadiana to the country of the Vettones 
<A NAME="770"></A>and Lusitania, with the like number of legions) divided among themselves 
<A NAME="771"></A>their respective departments. Petreius was to march from Lusitania through 
<A NAME="772"></A>the Vettones, and join Afranius with all his forces; Varro was to guard 
<A NAME="773"></A>all Further Spain with what legions he had. These matters being settled, 
<A NAME="774"></A>reinforcements of horse and foot were demanded from Lusitania, by Petreius; 
<A NAME="775"></A>from the Celtiberi, Cantabri, and all the barbarous nations which border 
<A NAME="776"></A>on the ocean, by Afranius. When they were raised, Petreius immediately 
<A NAME="777"></A>marched through the Vettones to Afranius. They resolved by joint consent 
<A NAME="778"></A>to carry on the war in the vicinity of Herba, on account of the advantages 
<A NAME="779"></A>of its situation.
<A NAME="780"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 39</B>
<A NAME="781"></A><BR><BR>Afranius, as above mentioned, had three legions, Petreius two. 
<A NAME="782"></A>There were besides about eighty cohorts raised in Hither and Further Spain 
<A NAME="783"></A>(of which, the troops belonging to the former province had shields, those 
<A NAME="784"></A>of the latter targets), and about five thousand horse raised in both provinces. 
<A NAME="785"></A>Caesar had sent his legions into Spain, with about six thousand auxiliary 
<A NAME="786"></A>foot, and three thousand horse, which had served under him in all his former 
<A NAME="787"></A>wars, and the same number from Gaul, which he himself had provided, having 
<A NAME="788"></A>expressly called out all the most noble and valiant men of each state. 
<A NAME="789"></A>The bravest of these were from the Aquitani and the mountaineers, who border 
<A NAME="790"></A>on the Province in Gaul. He had been informed that Pompey was marching 
<A NAME="791"></A>through Mauritania with his legions to Spain, and would shortly arrive. 
<A NAME="792"></A>He at the same time borrowed money from the tribunes and centurions, which 
<A NAME="793"></A>he distributed among his soldiers. By this proceeding he gained two points; 
<A NAME="794"></A>he secured the interest of the centurions by this pledge in his hands, 
<A NAME="795"></A>and by his liberality he purchased the affections of his 
<A NAME="796"></A>army.
<A NAME="797"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 40</B>
<A NAME="798"></A><BR><BR>Fabius sounded the inclinations of the neighboring states by letters 
<A NAME="799"></A>and messengers. He had made two bridges over the river Segre, at the distance 
<A NAME="800"></A>of four miles from each other. He sent foraging parties over these bridges, 
<A NAME="801"></A>because he had already consumed all the forage that was on his side of 
<A NAME="802"></A>the river. The generals of Pompey's army did almost the same thing, and 
<A NAME="803"></A>for the same reason: and the horse had frequent skirmishes with each other. 
<A NAME="804"></A>When two of Fabius's legions had, as was their constant practice, gone 
<A NAME="805"></A>forth as the usual protection to the foragers, and had crossed the river, 
<A NAME="806"></A>and the baggage, and all the horse were following them, on a sudden, from 
<A NAME="807"></A>the weight of the cattle, and the mass of water, the bridge fell, and all 
<A NAME="808"></A>the horse were cut off from the main army, which being known to Petreius 
<A NAME="809"></A>and Afranius, from the timber and hurdles that were carried down the river, 
<A NAME="810"></A>Afranius immediately crossed his own bridge, which communicated between 
<A NAME="811"></A>his camp and the town, with four legions and all the cavalry, and marched 
<A NAME="812"></A>against Fabius's two legions. When his approach was announced, Lucius Plancus, 
<A NAME="813"></A>who had the command of those legions, compelled by the emergency, took 
<A NAME="814"></A>post on a rising ground; and drew up his army with two fronts, that it 
<A NAME="815"></A>might not be surrounded by the cavalry. Thus, though engaged with superior 
<A NAME="816"></A>numbers, he sustained the furious charge of the legions and the horse. 
<A NAME="817"></A>When the battle was begun by the horse, there were observed at a distance 
<A NAME="818"></A>by both sides the colors of two legions, which Caius Fabius had sent round 
<A NAME="819"></A>by the further bridge to reinforce our men, suspecting, as the event verified, 
<A NAME="820"></A>that the enemy's generals would take advantage of the opportunity which 
<A NAME="821"></A>fortune had put in their way, to attack our men. Their approach put an 
<A NAME="822"></A>end to the battle, and each general led back his legions to their respective 
<A NAME="823"></A>camps.
<A NAME="824"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 41</B>
<A NAME="825"></A><BR><BR>In two days after Caesar came to the camp with nine hundred horse, 
<A NAME="826"></A>which he had retained for a body guard. The bridge which had been broken 
<A NAME="827"></A>down by the storm was almost repaired, and he ordered it to be finished 
<A NAME="828"></A>in the night. Being acquainted with the nature of the country, he left 
<A NAME="829"></A>behind him six cohorts to guard the bridge, the camp, and all his baggage, 
<A NAME="830"></A>and the next day set off in person for Ilerda, with all his forces drawn 
<A NAME="831"></A>up in three lines, and halted just before the camp of Afranius, and having 
<A NAME="832"></A>remained there a short time under arms, he offered him battle on equal 
<A NAME="833"></A>terms. When this affair was made, Afranius drew out his forces, and posted 
<A NAME="834"></A>them on the middle of a hill, near his camp. When Caesar perceived that 
<A NAME="835"></A>Afranius declined coming to an engagement, he resolved to encamp at somewhat 
<A NAME="836"></A>less than half a mile's distance from the very foot of the mountain; and 
<A NAME="837"></A>that his soldiers while engaged in their works, might not be terrified 
<A NAME="838"></A>by any sudden attack of the enemy, or disturbed in their work, he ordered 
<A NAME="839"></A>them not to fortify it with a wall, which must rise high, and be seen at 
<A NAME="840"></A>a distance, but draw, on the front opposite the enemy, a trench fifteen 
<A NAME="841"></A>feet broad. The first and second lines confined under arms, as was from 
<A NAME="842"></A>the first appointed. Behind them the third line was carrying on the work 
<A NAME="843"></A>without being seen; so that the whole was completed before Afranius discovered 
<A NAME="844"></A>that the camp was being fortified.
<A NAME="845"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 42</B>
<A NAME="846"></A><BR><BR>In the evening Caesar drew his legions within this trench, and 
<A NAME="847"></A>rested them under arms the next night. The day following he kept his whole 
<A NAME="848"></A>army within it, and as it was necessary to bring materials from a considerable 
<A NAME="849"></A>distance, he for the present pursued the same plan in his work; and to 
<A NAME="850"></A>each legion, one after the other, he assigned one side of the camp to fortify, 
<A NAME="851"></A>and ordered trenches of the same magnitude to be cut: he kept the rest 
<A NAME="852"></A>of the legions under arms without baggage to oppose the enemy. Afranius 
<A NAME="853"></A>and Petreius, to frighten us and obstruct the work, drew out their forces 
<A NAME="854"></A>at the very foot of the mountain, and challenged us to battle. Caesar, 
<A NAME="855"></A>however, did not interrupt his work, relying on the protection of the three 
<A NAME="856"></A>legions, and the strength of the fosse. After staying for a short time, 
<A NAME="857"></A>and advancing no great distance from the bottom of the hill, they led back 
<A NAME="858"></A>their forces to their camp. The third day Caesar fortified his camp with 
<A NAME="859"></A>a rampart, and ordered the other cohorts which he had left in the upper 
<A NAME="860"></A>camp, and his baggage to be removed to it.
<A NAME="861"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 43</B>
<A NAME="862"></A><BR><BR>Between the town of Ilerda and the next hill, on which Afranius 
<A NAME="863"></A>and Petreius were encamped, there was a plain about three hundred paces 
<A NAME="864"></A>broad, and near the middle of it an eminence somewhat raised above the 
<A NAME="865"></A>level: Caesar hoped that if he could get possession of this and fortify 
<A NAME="866"></A>it, he should be able to cut off the enemy from the town, the bridge, and 
<A NAME="867"></A>all the stores which they had laid up in the town. In expectation of this 
<A NAME="868"></A>he led three legions out of the camp, and, drawing up his army in an advantageous 
<A NAME="869"></A>position, he ordered the advanced men of one legion to hasten forward and 
<A NAME="870"></A>seize the eminence. Upon intelligence of this the cohorts which were on 
<A NAME="871"></A>guard before Afranius's camp were instantly sent a nearer way to occupy 
<A NAME="872"></A>the same post. The two parties engage, and as Afranius's men had reached 
<A NAME="873"></A>the eminence first, our men were repulsed, and, on a reinforcement being 
<A NAME="874"></A>sent, they were obliged to turn their backs and retreat to the standards 
<A NAME="875"></A>of legions.
<A NAME="876"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 44</B>
<A NAME="877"></A><BR><BR>The manner of fighting of those soldiers was to run forward with 
<A NAME="878"></A>great impetuosity and boldly take a post, and not to keep their ranks strictly, 
<A NAME="879"></A>but to fight in small scattered parties: if hard pressed they thought it 
<A NAME="880"></A>no disgrace to retire and give up the post, being accustomed to this manner 
<A NAME="881"></A>of fighting among the Lusitanians and other barbarous nations; for it commonly 
<A NAME="882"></A>happens that soldiers are strongly influenced by the customs of those countries 
<A NAME="883"></A>in which they have spent much time. This method, however, alarmed our men, 
<A NAME="884"></A>who were not used to such a description of warfare. For they imagined that 
<A NAME="885"></A>they were about to be surrounded on their exposed flank by the single men 
<A NAME="886"></A>who ran forward from their ranks; and they thought it their duty to keep 
<A NAME="887"></A>their ranks, and not to quit their colors, nor, without good reason to 
<A NAME="888"></A>give up the post which they had taken. Accordingly, when the advanced guard 
<A NAME="889"></A>gave way, the legion which was stationed on that wing did not keep its 
<A NAME="890"></A>ground, but retreated to the next hill.
<A NAME="891"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 45</B>
<A NAME="892"></A><BR><BR>Almost the whole army being daunted at this, because it had occurred 
<A NAME="893"></A>contrary to their expectations and custom, Caesar encouraged his men and 
<A NAME="894"></A>led the ninth legion to their relief, and checked the insolent and eager 
<A NAME="895"></A>pursuit of the enemy, and obliged them, in their turn, to show their backs, 
<A NAME="896"></A>and retreat to Ilerda, and take post under the walls. But the soldiers 
<A NAME="897"></A>of the ninth legion, being over zealous to repair the dishonor which had 
<A NAME="898"></A>been sustained, having rashly pursued the fleeing enemy, advanced into 
<A NAME="899"></A>disadvantageous ground and went up to the foot of the mountain on which 
<A NAME="900"></A>the town Ilerda was built. And when they wished to retire they were again 
<A NAME="901"></A>attacked by the enemy from the rising ground. The place was craggy in the 
<A NAME="902"></A>front and steep on either side, and was so narrow that even three cohorts, 
<A NAME="903"></A>drawn up in order of battle, would fill it; but no relief could be sent 
<A NAME="904"></A>on the flanks, and the horse could be of no service to them when hard pressed. 
<A NAME="905"></A>From the town, indeed, the precipice inclined with a gentle slope for near 
<A NAME="906"></A>four hundred paces. Our men had to retreat this way, as they had, through 
<A NAME="907"></A>their eagerness, advanced too inconsiderately. The greatest contest was 
<A NAME="908"></A>in this place, which was much to the disadvantage of our troops, both on 
<A NAME="909"></A>account of its narrowness, and because they were posted at the foot of 
<A NAME="910"></A>the mountain, so that no weapon was thrown at them without effect; yet 
<A NAME="911"></A>they exerted their valor and patience, and bore every wound. The enemy's 
<A NAME="912"></A>forces were increasing, and cohorts were frequently sent to their aid from 
<A NAME="913"></A>the camp through the town, that fresh men might relieve the weary. Caesar 
<A NAME="914"></A>was obliged to do the same, and relieve the fatigued by sending cohorts 
<A NAME="915"></A>to that post.
<A NAME="916"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 46</B>
<A NAME="917"></A><BR><BR>After the battle had in this manner continued incessantly for five 
<A NAME="918"></A>hours, and our men had suffered much from superior numbers, having spent 
<A NAME="919"></A>all their javelins, they drew their swords and charged the enemy up the 
<A NAME="920"></A>hill, and, having killed a few, obliged the rest to fly. The cohorts being 
<A NAME="921"></A>beaten back to the wall, and some being driven by their fears into the 
<A NAME="922"></A>town, an easy retreat was afforded to our men. Our cavalry also, on either 
<A NAME="923"></A>flank, though stationed on sloping or low ground, yet bravely struggled 
<A NAME="924"></A>up to the top of the hill, and, riding between the two armies, made our 
<A NAME="925"></A>retreat more easy and secure. Such were the various turns of fortune in 
<A NAME="926"></A>the battle. In the first encounter about seventy of our men fell: among 
<A NAME="927"></A>them Quintus Fulgenius, first centurion of the second line of the fourteenth 
<A NAME="928"></A>legion, who, for his extraordinary valor, had been promoted from the lower 
<A NAME="929"></A>ranks to that post. About six hundred were wounded. Of Afranius's party 
<A NAME="930"></A>there were killed Titus Caecilius, principal centurion, and four other 
<A NAME="931"></A>centurions, and above two hundred men.
<A NAME="932"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 47</B>
<A NAME="933"></A><BR><BR>But this opinion is spread abroad concerning this day, that each 
<A NAME="934"></A>party thought that they came off conquerors. Afranius's soldiers, because, 
<A NAME="935"></A>though they were esteemed inferior in the opinion of all, yet they had 
<A NAME="936"></A>stood our attack and sustained our charge, and, at first, had kept the 
<A NAME="937"></A>post on the hill which had been the occasion of the dispute; and, in the 
<A NAME="938"></A>first encounter, had obliged our men to fly: but ours, because, notwithstanding 
<A NAME="939"></A>the disadvantage of the ground and the disparity of numbers, they had maintained 
<A NAME="940"></A>the battle for five hours, had advanced up the hill sword in hand, and 
<A NAME="941"></A>had forced the enemy to fly from the higher ground and driven them into 
<A NAME="942"></A>the town. The enemy fortified the hill, about which the contest had been, 
<A NAME="943"></A>with strong works and posted a garrison on it.
<A NAME="944"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 48</B>
<A NAME="945"></A><BR><BR>In two days after this transaction, there happened an unexpected 
<A NAME="946"></A>misfortune. For so great a storm arose, that it was agreed that there were 
<A NAME="947"></A>never seen higher floods in those countries; it swept down the snow from 
<A NAME="948"></A>all the mountains, and broke over the banks of the river, and in one day 
<A NAME="949"></A>carried away both the bridges which Fabius had built - a circumstance which 
<A NAME="950"></A>caused great difficulties to Caesar's army. For as our camp, as already 
<A NAME="951"></A>mentioned, was pitched between two rivers, the Segre and Cinca, and as 
<A NAME="952"></A>neither of these could be forded for the space of thirty miles, they were 
<A NAME="953"></A>all of necessity confined within these narrow limits. Neither could the 
<A NAME="954"></A>states, which had espoused Caesar's cause, furnish him with corn, nor the 
<A NAME="955"></A>troops, which had gone far to forage, return, as they were stopped by the 
<A NAME="956"></A>waters: nor could the convoys, coming from Italy and Gaul, make their way 
<A NAME="957"></A>to the camp. Besides, it was the most distressing season of the year, when 
<A NAME="958"></A>there was no corn in the blade, and it was nearly ripe: and the states 
<A NAME="959"></A>were exhausted, because Afranius had conveyed almost all the corn, before 
<A NAME="960"></A>Caesar's arrival, into Ilerda, and whatever he had left, had been already 
<A NAME="961"></A>consumed by Caesar. The cattle, which might have served as a secondary 
<A NAME="962"></A>resource against want, had been removed by the states to a great distance 
<A NAME="963"></A>on account of the war. They who had gone out to get forage or corn, were 
<A NAME="964"></A>chased by the light troops of the Lusitanians, and the targeteers of Hither 
<A NAME="965"></A>Spain, who were well acquainted with the country, and could readily swim 
<A NAME="966"></A>across the river, because it is the custom of all those people not to join 
<A NAME="967"></A>their armies without bladders.
<A NAME="968"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 49</B>
<A NAME="969"></A><BR><BR>But Afranius's army had abundance of everything; a great stock 
<A NAME="970"></A>of corn had been provided and laid in long before, a large quantity was 
<A NAME="971"></A>coming in from the whole province: they had a good store of forage. The 
<A NAME="972"></A>bridge of Ilerda afforded an opportunity of getting all these without any 
<A NAME="973"></A>danger, and the places beyond the bridge, to which Caesar had no access, 
<A NAME="974"></A>were as yet untouched.
<A NAME="975"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 50</B>
<A NAME="976"></A><BR><BR>Those floods continued several days. Caesar endeavored to repair 
<A NAME="977"></A>the bridges, but the height of the water did not allow him: and the cohorts 
<A NAME="978"></A>disposed along the banks did not suffer them to be completed; and it was 
<A NAME="979"></A>easy for them to prevent it, both from the nature of the river and the 
<A NAME="980"></A>height of the water, but especially because their darts were thrown from 
<A NAME="981"></A>the whole course of the bank on one confined spot; and it was no easy matter 
<A NAME="982"></A>at one and the same time to execute a work in a very rapid flood, and to 
<A NAME="983"></A>avoid the darts.
<A NAME="984"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 51</B>
<A NAME="985"></A><BR><BR>Intelligence was brought to Afranius that the great convoys, which 
<A NAME="986"></A>were on their march to Caesar, had halted at the river. Archers from the 
<A NAME="987"></A>Rutheni, and horse from the Gauls, with a long train of baggage, according 
<A NAME="988"></A>to the Gallic custom of traveling, had arrived there; there were besides 
<A NAME="989"></A>about six thousand people of all descriptions, with slaves and freed men. 
<A NAME="990"></A>But there was no order, or regular discipline, as every one followed his 
<A NAME="991"></A>own humor, and all traveled without apprehension, taking the same liberty 
<A NAME="992"></A>as on former marches. There were several young noblemen, sons of senators, 
<A NAME="993"></A>and of equestrian rank; there were embassadors from several states; there 
<A NAME="994"></A>were lieutenants of Caesar's. The river stopped them all. To attack them 
<A NAME="995"></A>by surprise, Afranius set out in the beginning of the night, with all his 
<A NAME="996"></A>cavalry and three legions, and sent the horse on before, to fall on them 
<A NAME="997"></A>unawares; but the Gallic horse soon got themselves in readiness, and attacked 
<A NAME="998"></A>them. Though but few, they withstood the vast number of the enemy, as long 
<A NAME="999"></A>as they fought on equal terms; but when the legions began to approach, 
<A NAME="1000"></A>having lost a few men, they retreated to the next mountains. The delay 
<A NAME="1001"></A>occasioned by this battle was of great importance to the security of our 
<A NAME="1002"></A>men; for having gained time, they retired to the higher grounds. There 
<A NAME="1003"></A>were missing that day about two hundred bow-men, a few horse, and an inconsiderable 
<A NAME="1004"></A>number of servants and baggage.
<A NAME="1005"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 52</B>
<A NAME="1006"></A><BR><BR>However, by all these things, the price of provisions was raised, 
<A NAME="1007"></A>which is commonly a disaster attendant, not only on a time of present scarcity, 
<A NAME="1008"></A>but on the apprehension of future want. Provisions had now reached fifty 
<A NAME="1009"></A>denarii each bushel; and the want of corn had diminished the strength of 
<A NAME="1010"></A>the soldiers; and the inconveniences were increasing every day; and so 
<A NAME="1011"></A>great an alteration was wrought in a few days, and fortune had so changed 
<A NAME="1012"></A>sides, that our men had to struggle with the want of every necessary; while 
<A NAME="1013"></A>the enemy had an abundant supply of all things, and were considered to 
<A NAME="1014"></A>have the advantage. Caesar demanded from those states which had acceded 
<A NAME="1015"></A>to his alliance, a supply of cattle, as they had but little corn. He sent 
<A NAME="1016"></A>away the camp followers to the more distant states, and endeavored to remedy 
<A NAME="1017"></A>the present scarcity by every resource in his power.
<A NAME="1018"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 53</B>
<A NAME="1019"></A><BR><BR>Afranius and Petreius, and their friends, sent fuller and more 
<A NAME="1020"></A>circumstantial accounts of these things to Rome, to their acquaintances. 
<A NAME="1021"></A>Report exaggerated them so that the war appeared to be almost at an end. 
<A NAME="1022"></A>When these letters and dispatches were received at Rome, a great concourse 
<A NAME="1023"></A>of people resorted to the house of Afranius, and congratulations ran high; 
<A NAME="1024"></A>several went out of Italy to Cneius Pompey; some of them, to be the first 
<A NAME="1025"></A>to bring him the intelligence; others, that they might not be thought to 
<A NAME="1026"></A>have waited the issue of the war, and to have come last of 
<A NAME="1027"></A>all.
<A NAME="1028"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 54</B>
<A NAME="1029"></A><BR><BR>When Caesar's affairs were in this unfavorable position, and all 
<A NAME="1030"></A>the passes were guarded by the soldiers and horse of Afranius, and the 
<A NAME="1031"></A>bridges could not be prepared, Caesar ordered his soldiers to make ships 
<A NAME="1032"></A>of the kind that his knowledge of Britain a few years before had taught 
<A NAME="1033"></A>him. First, the keels and ribs were made of light timber, then, the rest 
<A NAME="1034"></A>of the hulk of the ships was wrought with wicker work, and covered over 
<A NAME="1035"></A>with hides. When these were finished, he drew them down to the river in 
<A NAME="1036"></A>wagons in one night, a distance of twenty-two miles from his camp, and 
<A NAME="1037"></A>transported in them some soldiers across the river, and on a sudden took 
<A NAME="1038"></A>possession of a hill adjoining the bank. This he immediately fortified, 
<A NAME="1039"></A>before he was perceived by the enemy. To this he afterward transported 
<A NAME="1040"></A>a legion: and having begun a bridge on both sides, he finished it in two 
<A NAME="1041"></A>days. By this means, he brought safe to his camp, the convoys, and those 
<A NAME="1042"></A>who had gone out to forage; and began to prepare a conveyance for the 
<A NAME="1043"></A>provisions.
<A NAME="1044"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 55</B>
<A NAME="1045"></A><BR><BR>The same day he made a great part of his horse pass the river, 
<A NAME="1046"></A>who, falling on the foragers by surprise as they were dispersed without 
<A NAME="1047"></A>any suspicions, intercepted an incredible number of cattle and people; 
<A NAME="1048"></A>and when some Spanish light-armed cohorts were sent to reinforce the enemy, 
<A NAME="1049"></A>our men judiciously divided themselves into two parts, the one to protect 
<A NAME="1050"></A>the spoil, the other to resist the advancing foe, and to beat them back, 
<A NAME="1051"></A>and they cut off from the rest and surrounded one cohort, which had rashly 
<A NAME="1052"></A>ventured out of the line before the others, and after putting it to the 
<A NAME="1053"></A>sword, returned safe with considerable booty to the camp over the same 
<A NAME="1054"></A>bridge.
<A NAME="1055"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 56</B>
<A NAME="1056"></A><BR><BR>While these affairs are going forward at Ilerda, the Massilians, 
<A NAME="1057"></A>adopting the advice of Domitius, prepared seventeen ships of war, of which 
<A NAME="1058"></A>eleven were decked. To these they add several smaller vessels, that our 
<A NAME="1059"></A>fleet might be terrified by numbers; they man them with a great number 
<A NAME="1060"></A>of archers and of the Albici, of whom mention has been already made, and 
<A NAME="1061"></A>these they incited by rewards and promises. Domitius required certain ships 
<A NAME="1062"></A>for his own use, which he manned with colonists and shepherds, whom he 
<A NAME="1063"></A>had brought along with him. A fleet being thus furnished with every necessary, 
<A NAME="1064"></A>he advanced with great confidence against our ships, commanded by Decimus 
<A NAME="1065"></A>Brutus. It was stationed at an island opposite to Massilia.
<A NAME="1066"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 57</B>
<A NAME="1067"></A><BR><BR>Brutus was much inferior in number of ships; but Caesar had appointed 
<A NAME="1068"></A>to that fleet the bravest men selected from all his legions, antesignani 
<A NAME="1069"></A>and centurions, who had requested to be employed in that service. They 
<A NAME="1070"></A>had provided iron hooks and harpoons, and had furnished themselves with 
<A NAME="1071"></A>a vast number of javelins, darts, and missiles. Thus prepared, and being 
<A NAME="1072"></A>apprised of the enemy's approach, they put out from the harbor, and engaged 
<A NAME="1073"></A>the Massilians. Both sides fought with great courage and resolution; nor 
<A NAME="1074"></A>did the Albici, a hardy people, bred on the highlands and inured to arms, 
<A NAME="1075"></A>fall much short of our men in valor: and being lately come from the Massilians, 
<A NAME="1076"></A>they retained in their minds their recent promises: and the wild shepherds, 
<A NAME="1077"></A>encouraged by the hope of liberty, were eager to prove their zeal in the 
<A NAME="1078"></A>presence of their masters.
<A NAME="1079"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 58</B>
<A NAME="1080"></A><BR><BR>The Massilians themselves, confiding in the quickness of their 
<A NAME="1081"></A>ships, and the skill of their pilots, eluded ours, and evaded the shock, 
<A NAME="1082"></A>and as long as they were permitted by clear space, lengthening their line 
<A NAME="1083"></A>they endeavored to surround us, or to attack single ships with several 
<A NAME="1084"></A>of theirs, or to run across our ships, and carry away our oars, if possible; 
<A NAME="1085"></A>but when necessity obliged them to come nearer, they had recourse, from 
<A NAME="1086"></A>the skill and art of the pilots, to the valor of the mountaineers. But 
<A NAME="1087"></A>our men, not having such expert seamen, or skillful pilots, for they had 
<A NAME="1088"></A>been hastily drafted from the merchant ships, and were not yet acquainted 
<A NAME="1089"></A>even with the names of the rigging, were moreover impeded by the heaviness 
<A NAME="1090"></A>and slowness of our vessels, which having been built in a hurry and of 
<A NAME="1091"></A>green timber, were not so easily maneuvered. Therefore, when Caesar's men 
<A NAME="1092"></A>had an opportunity of a close engagement, they cheerfully opposed two of 
<A NAME="1093"></A>the enemy's ships with one of theirs. And throwing in the grappling-irons, 
<A NAME="1094"></A>and holding both ships fast, they fought on both sides of the deck, and 
<A NAME="1095"></A>boarded the enemy's; and having killed numbers of the Albici and shepherds, 
<A NAME="1096"></A>they sank some of their ships, took others with the men on board, and drove 
<A NAME="1097"></A>the rest into the harbor. That day the Massilians lost nine ships, including 
<A NAME="1098"></A>those that were taken.
<A NAME="1099"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 59</B>
<A NAME="1100"></A><BR><BR>When news of this battle was brought to Caesar at Ilerda, the bridge 
<A NAME="1101"></A>being completed at the same time, fortune soon took a turn. The enemy, 
<A NAME="1102"></A>daunted by the courage of our horse, did not scour the country as freely 
<A NAME="1103"></A>or as boldly as before: but sometimes advancing a small distance from the 
<A NAME="1104"></A>camp, that they might have a ready retreat, they foraged within narrower

<A NAME="1107"></A>at a distance, they fled in the midst of their expedition, leaving their 
<A NAME="1108"></A>baggage behind them; at length they resolved to leave off foraging for 
<A NAME="1109"></A>several days, and, contrary to the practice of all nations, to go out at 
<A NAME="1110"></A>night.
