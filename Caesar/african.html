<BR><A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A>Chapter 1
<A NAME="11"></A><BR><BR>Caesar, advancing by moderate journeys, and continuing his march 
<A NAME="12"></A>without intermission, arrived at Lilybaeum, on the 14th day before the 
<A NAME="13"></A>calends of January. Designing to embark immediately, though he had only 
<A NAME="14"></A>one legion of new levies, and not quite six hundred horse, he ordered his 
<A NAME="15"></A>tent to be pitched so near the sea-side that the waves lashed the very 
<A NAME="16"></A>foot of it. This he did with a view that none should think he had time 
<A NAME="17"></A>to delay, and that his men might be kept in readiness at a day or an hour's 
<A NAME="18"></A>warning. Though the wind at that time was contrary, he nevertheless detained 
<A NAME="19"></A>the soldiers and mariners on board, that he might lose no opportunity of 
<A NAME="20"></A>sailing; the rather, because the forces of the enemy were announced by 
<A NAME="21"></A>the inhabitants of the province, to consist of innumberable cavalry not 
<A NAME="22"></A>to be numbered; four legions headed by Juba, together with a great body 
<A NAME="23"></A>of light-armed troops; ten legions under the command of Scipio; a hundred 
<A NAME="24"></A>and twenty elephants, and fleets in abundance. Yet he was not alarmed, 
<A NAME="25"></A>nor lost his confident hopes and spirits. Meantime the number of galleys 
<A NAME="26"></A>and transports increased daily; the new-levied legions flocked in to him 
<A NAME="27"></A>from all parts; among the rest the fifth, a veteran legion, and about two 
<A NAME="28"></A>thousand horse.
<A NAME="29"></A><BR><BR>Chapter 2
<A NAME="30"></A><BR><BR>Having got together six legions and about two thousand horse, he 
<A NAME="31"></A>embarked the legions as fast as they arrived, in the galleys, and the cavalry 
<A NAME="32"></A>in the transports. Then sending the greatest part of the fleet before, 
<A NAME="33"></A>with orders to sail for the island of Aponiana, not far from Lilybaeum; 
<A NAME="34"></A>he himself continued a little longer in Sicily, and exposed to public sale 
<A NAME="35"></A>some confiscated estates. Leaving all other affairs to the care of Allienus 
<A NAME="36"></A>the praetor, who then commanded in the island; and strictly charging him 
<A NAME="37"></A>to use the utmost expedition in embarking the remainder of the troops; 
<A NAME="38"></A>he set sail the sixth day before the calends of January, and soon came 
<A NAME="39"></A>up with the rest of the fleet. As the wind was favorable, and afforded 
<A NAME="40"></A>a quick passage, he arrived the fourth day within sight of Africa, attended 
<A NAME="41"></A>by a few galleys: for the transports, being mostly dispersed and scattered 
<A NAME="42"></A>by the winds, with the exception of a few were driven different ways. Passing 
<A NAME="43"></A>Clupea and Neapolis with the fleet, he continued for some time to coast 
<A NAME="44"></A>along the shore, leaving many towns and castles behind 
<A NAME="45"></A>him.
<A NAME="46"></A><BR><BR>Chapter 3
<A NAME="47"></A><BR><BR>After he came before Adrumetum, where the enemy had a garrison, 
<A NAME="48"></A>commanded by C. Considius, and where Cn. Piso appeared upon the shore toward 
<A NAME="49"></A>Clupea, with the cavalry of Adrumetum, and about three thousand Moors, 
<A NAME="50"></A>he stopped awhile, facing the port, till the rest of the fleet should come 
<A NAME="51"></A>up, and then landed his men, though their number at that time did not exceed 
<A NAME="52"></A>three thousand foot and a hundred and fifty horse. There, encamping before 
<A NAME="53"></A>the town, he continued quiet, without offering any act of hostility, and 
<A NAME="54"></A>restrained all from plunder. Meantime the inhabitants manned the walls, 
<A NAME="55"></A>and assembled in great numbers before the gate, to defend themselves, their 
<A NAME="56"></A>garrison within amounting to two legions. Caesar, having ridden round the 
<A NAME="57"></A>town, and thoroughly examined its situation, returned to his camp. Some 
<A NAME="58"></A>blamed his conduct on this occasion, and charged him with a considerable 
<A NAME="59"></A>oversight, in not appointing a place of meeting to the pilots and captains 
<A NAME="60"></A>of the fleet, or delivering them sealed instructions, according to his 
<A NAME="61"></A>usual custom; which being opened at a certain time, might have directed 
<A NAME="62"></A>them to assemble at a specified place. But in this Caesar acted not without 
<A NAME="63"></A>design; for as he knew of no port in Africa that was clear of the enemy's 
<A NAME="64"></A>forces, and where the fleet might rendezvous in security, he chose to rely 
<A NAME="65"></A>entirely upon fortune, and land where occasion offered.
<A NAME="66"></A><BR><BR>Chapter 4
<A NAME="67"></A><BR><BR>In the mean time, L. Plancus, one of Caesar's lieutenants, desired 
<A NAME="68"></A>leave to treat with Considius, and try, if possible, to bring him to reason. 
<A NAME="69"></A>Leave being granted accordingly, he wrote him a letter, and sent it into 
<A NAME="70"></A>the town by a captive. When the captive arrived, and presented the letter, 
<A NAME="71"></A>Considius, before he received it, demanded whence it came, and being told 
<A NAME="72"></A>from Caesar, the Roman general, answered, "That he knew no general of the 
<A NAME="73"></A>Roman forces but Scipio." Then, commending the messenger to be immediately 
<A NAME="74"></A>slain in his presence, he delivered the letter, unread and unopened, to 
<A NAME="75"></A>a trusty partisan, with orders to carry it directly to 
<A NAME="76"></A>Scipio.
<A NAME="77"></A><BR><BR>Chapter 5
<A NAME="78"></A><BR><BR>Caesar had now continued a day and a night before the town, without 
<A NAME="79"></A>receiving any answer from Considius; the rest of the forces were not yet 
<A NAME="80"></A>arrived; his cavalry was not considerable; he had not sufficient troops 
<A NAME="81"></A>with him to invest the place, and these were new levies: neither did he 
<A NAME="82"></A>think it advisable, upon his first landing, to expose the army to wounds 
<A NAME="83"></A>and fatigue; more especially, as the town was strongly fortified, and extremely 
<A NAME="84"></A>difficult of access, and a great body of horse was said to be upon the 
<A NAME="85"></A>point of arrival to succor the inhabitants; he therefore thought it advisable 
<A NAME="86"></A>not to remain and besiege the town, lest while he pursued that design, 
<A NAME="87"></A>the enemy's cavalry should come behind and surround 
<A NAME="88"></A>him.
<A NAME="89"></A><BR><BR>Chapter 6
<A NAME="90"></A><BR><BR>But as he was drawing off his men, the garrison made a sudden sally; 
<A NAME="91"></A>and the cavalry which had been sent by Juba to receive their pay, happening 
<A NAME="92"></A>just then to come up, they took possession of the camp Caesar had left, 
<A NAME="93"></A>and began to harass his rear. This being perceived, the legionaries immediately 
<A NAME="94"></A>halted; and the cavalry, though few in number, boldly charged the vast 
<A NAME="95"></A>multitude of the enemy. An incredible event occurred, that less than thirty 
<A NAME="96"></A>Gallic horse repulsed two thousand Moors, and drove them into the town. 
<A NAME="97"></A>Having thus repulsed the enemy and compelled them to retire behind their 
<A NAME="98"></A>walls, Caesar resumed his intended march: but observing that they often 
<A NAME="99"></A>repeated their sallies, renewing the pursuit from time to time, and again 
<A NAME="100"></A>fleeing when attacked by the horse, he posted a few of the veteran cohorts 
<A NAME="101"></A>which he had with him, with part of the cavalry, in the rear, and so proceeded 
<A NAME="102"></A>slowly on his march. The further he advanced from the town, the less eager 
<A NAME="103"></A>were the Numidians to pursue. Meantime, deputies arrived from the several 
<A NAME="104"></A>towns and castles on the road, offering to furnish him with corn, and to 
<A NAME="105"></A>perform whatever he might command. Toward the evening of that day, which 
<A NAME="106"></A>was the calends of January, he fixed his camp at Ruspina.
<A NAME="107"></A><BR><BR>Chapter 7
<A NAME="108"></A><BR><BR>Thence he removed and came before Leptis, a free city and governed 
<A NAME="109"></A>by its own laws. Here he was met by deputies from the town, who, in the 
<A NAME="110"></A>name of the inhabitants, offered their free submission. Whereupon, placing 
<A NAME="111"></A>centurions and a guard before the gates, to prevent the soldiers from entering, 
<A NAME="112"></A>or offering violence to any of the inhabitants, he himself encamped toward 
<A NAME="113"></A>the shore, not far distant from the town. Hither by accident arrived some 
<A NAME="114"></A>of the galleys and transports; by whom he was informed that the rest of 
<A NAME="115"></A>the fleet, uncertain what course to pursue, had been steering for Utica. 
<A NAME="116"></A>In the mean time Caesar could not depart from the sea, nor seek the inland 
<A NAME="117"></A>provinces, on account of the error committed by the fleet. He likewise 
<A NAME="118"></A>sent the cavalry back to their ships, probably to hinder the country from 
<A NAME="119"></A>being plundered, and ordered fresh water to be carried to them on board. 
<A NAME="120"></A>Meanwhile the Moorish horse rose suddenly, Caesar's party not expecting 
<A NAME="121"></A>it, on the rowers who had been employed in carrying water, as they came 
<A NAME="122"></A>out of the ships, and wounded many with their darts and killed some. For 
<A NAME="123"></A>the manner of these barbarians is, to lie in ambush with their horses among 
<A NAME="124"></A>the valleys, and suddenly launch upon an enemy; they seldom choosing to 
<A NAME="125"></A>engage hand to hand in a plain.
<A NAME="126"></A><BR><BR>Chapter 8
<A NAME="127"></A><BR><BR>In the mean time, Caesar dispatched letters and messengers into 
<A NAME="128"></A>Sardinia and the neighboring provinces, with orders, as soon as they read 
<A NAME="129"></A>the letters, to send supplies of men, corn, and warlike stores; and having 
<A NAME="130"></A>unloaded part of the fleet, detached it, with Rabirius Posthumus, into 
<A NAME="131"></A>Sicily, to bring over the second embarkation. At the same time he ordered 
<A NAME="132"></A>out ten galleys, to get intelligence of the transports that had missed 
<A NAME="133"></A>their way, and to maintain the freedom of the sea. He also ordered C. Sallustius 
<A NAME="134"></A>Prispus, the praetor, at the head of a squadron, to sail to Percina, then 
<A NAME="135"></A>in the hands of the enemy, because he heard there was great quantity of 
<A NAME="136"></A>corn in that island: he gave these orders and instructions in such a manner 
<A NAME="137"></A>as to leave no room for excuse or delay. Meanwhile, having informed himself, 
<A NAME="138"></A>from the deserters and natives, of the condition of Scipio and his followers; 
<A NAME="139"></A>and understanding that they were at the whole charge of maintaining Juba's 
<A NAME="140"></A>cavalry; he could not but pity the infatuation of men, who thus chose to 
<A NAME="141"></A>be tributaries to the king of Numidia, rather than securely enjoy their 
<A NAME="142"></A>fortunes at home with their fellow-citizens.
<A NAME="143"></A><BR><BR>Chapter 9
<A NAME="144"></A><BR><BR>Caesar moved his camp on the third day before the nones of January; 
<A NAME="145"></A>and leaving six cohorts at Leptis, under the command of Saserna, returned 
<A NAME="146"></A>with the rest of the forces to Ruspina, whence he had come the day before. 
<A NAME="147"></A>Here he deposited the baggage of the army; and marching out with a light 
<A NAME="148"></A>body of troops to forage, ordered the inhabitants to follow with their 
<A NAME="149"></A>horses and carriages. Having by this means got together a great quantity 
<A NAME="150"></A>of corn, he came back to Ruspina. I think that he acted with this intention, 
<A NAME="151"></A>that by keeping possession of the maritime cities, and providing them with 
<A NAME="152"></A>garrisons, he might secure a retreat for his fleet.
<A NAME="153"></A><BR><BR>Chapter 10
<A NAME="154"></A><BR><BR>Leaving therefore P. Saserna, the brother of him who commanded 
<A NAME="155"></A>at Leptis, to take charge of the town, with one legion, he orders all the 
<A NAME="156"></A>wood that could be found to be carried into the place; and set out in person 
<A NAME="157"></A>from Ruspina, with seven cohorts, part of the veteran legions who had behaved 
<A NAME="158"></A>so well in the fleet under Sulpicius and Vatinius; and marching directly 
<A NAME="159"></A>for the port, which lies at about two miles' distance, embarked with them 
<A NAME="160"></A>in the evening, without imparting his intentions to the army, who were 
<A NAME="161"></A>extremely inquisitive concerning the general's design. His departure occasioned 
<A NAME="162"></A>the utmost sadness and consternation among the troops; for being few in 
<A NAME="163"></A>number, mostly new levies, and those not all suffered to land, they saw 
<A NAME="164"></A>themselves exposed, upon a foreign coast, to the mighty forces of a crafty 
<A NAME="165"></A>nation, supported by an innumerable cavalry. Nor had they any resource 
<A NAME="166"></A>in their present circumstances, or expectation of safety in their own conduct; 
<A NAME="167"></A>but derived all their hope from the alacrity, vigor, and wonderful cheerfulness 
<A NAME="168"></A>that appeared in their general's countenance; for he was of an intrepid 
<A NAME="169"></A>spirit, and behaved with undaunted resolution and confidence. On his conduct, 
<A NAME="170"></A>therefore, they entirely relied, and hoped to a man, that by his skill 
<A NAME="171"></A>and talents, all difficulties would vanish before them.
<A NAME="172"></A><BR><BR>Chapter 11
<A NAME="173"></A><BR><BR>Caesar, having continued the whole night on board, prepared to 
<A NAME="174"></A>set sail about day-break; when, all on a sudden, the part of the fleet 
<A NAME="175"></A>that had caused so much anxiety, appeared unexpectedly in view. Wherefore, 
<A NAME="176"></A>ordering his men to quit their ships immediately, and receive the rest 
<A NAME="177"></A>of the troops in arms upon the shore, he made the new fleet enter the port 
<A NAME="178"></A>with the utmost diligence; and landing all the forces, horse and foot, 
<A NAME="179"></A>returned again to Ruspina. Here he established his camp; and taking with 
<A NAME="180"></A>him thirty cohorts, without baggage, advanced into the country to forage. 
<A NAME="181"></A>Thus was Caesar's purpose at length discovered: that he meant, unknown 
<A NAME="182"></A>to the enemy, to have sailed to the assistance of the transports that had 
<A NAME="183"></A>missed their way, lest they should unexpectedly fall in with the African 
<A NAME="184"></A>fleet. And he did not wish his own soldiers who were left behind in garrison 
<A NAME="185"></A>to know this, lest they should be intimidated by the smallness of their 
<A NAME="186"></A>numbers, and the multitude of the enemy.
<A NAME="187"></A><BR><BR>Chapter 12
<A NAME="188"></A><BR><BR>Caesar had not marched above three miles from his camp, when he 
<A NAME="189"></A>was informed by his scouts, and some advanced parties of horse, that the 
<A NAME="190"></A>enemy's forces were in view. As soon as this announcement was made, a great 
<A NAME="191"></A>cloud of dust began to appear. Upon this intelligence, Caesar ordered all 
<A NAME="192"></A>his horse, of which he had at that time but a very small number, to advance, 
<A NAME="193"></A>as likewise his archers, only a few of whom had followed him from the camp; 
<A NAME="194"></A>and the legions to march quietly after him in order of battle; while he 
<A NAME="195"></A>went forward at the head of a small party. Soon after, having discovered 
<A NAME="196"></A>the enemy at some distance, he commanded the soldiers to repair to their 
<A NAME="197"></A>arms, and prepare for battle. Their number in all did not exceed thirty 
<A NAME="198"></A>cohorts, with four hundred horse, and one hundred and fifty 
<A NAME="199"></A>archers.
<A NAME="200"></A><BR><BR>Chapter 13
<A NAME="201"></A><BR><BR>Meanwhile the enemy, under the command of Labienus, and the two 
<A NAME="202"></A>Pacidii, drew up, with a very large front, consisting not so much of foot 
<A NAME="203"></A>as of horse, whom they intermixed with light-armed Numidians and archers; 
<A NAME="204"></A>forming themselves in such close order, that Caesar's army, at a distance, 
<A NAME="205"></A>mistook them all for infantry; and strengthening their right and left with 
<A NAME="206"></A>many squadrons of horse. Caesar drew up his army in a single line, being 
<A NAME="207"></A>obliged to do so by the smallness of his numbers; covering his front with 
<A NAME="208"></A>his archers, and placing his cavalry on the right and left wings, with 
<A NAME="209"></A>particular instructions not to suffer themselves to be surrounded by the 
<A NAME="210"></A>enemy's numerous horse; for he imagined that he would have to fight only 
<A NAME="211"></A>with infantry.
<A NAME="212"></A><BR><BR>Chapter 14
<A NAME="213"></A><BR><BR>As both sides stood in expectation of the signal, and Caesar would 
<A NAME="214"></A>not stir from his post, as he saw that with such few troops against so 
<A NAME="215"></A>great a force he must depend more on stratagem than strength, on a sudden 
<A NAME="216"></A>the enemy's horse began to extend themselves, and move in a lateral direction, 
<A NAME="217"></A>so as to encompass the hills and weaken Caesar's horse, and at the same 
<A NAME="218"></A>time to surround them. The latter could scarcely keep their ground against 
<A NAME="219"></A>their numbers. Meanwhile, both the main bodies advancing to engage, the 
<A NAME="220"></A>enemy's cavalry, intermixed with some light-armed Numidians, suddenly sprang 
<A NAME="221"></A>forward, from their crowded troops, and attacked the legions with a shower 
<A NAME="222"></A>of darts. Our men, preparing to return the charge, their horse retreated 
<A NAME="223"></A>a little, while the foot continued to maintain their ground, till the others, 
<A NAME="224"></A>having rallied, came on again, with fresh vigor, to sustain 
<A NAME="225"></A>them.
<A NAME="226"></A><BR><BR>Chapter 15
<A NAME="227"></A><BR><BR>Caesar perceived that his ranks were in danger of being broken 
<A NAME="228"></A>by this new way of fighting, for our foot, in pursuing the enemy's horse, 
<A NAME="229"></A>having advanced a considerable way beyond their colors, were wounded in 
<A NAME="230"></A>the flank by the nearest Numidian darts, while the enemy's horse easily 
<A NAME="231"></A>escaped our infantry's javelins by flight; he therefore gave express orders 
<A NAME="232"></A>that no soldier should advance above four feet beyond the ensigns. Meanwhile, 
<A NAME="233"></A>Labienus's cavalry, confiding in their numbers endeavored to surround those 
<A NAME="234"></A>of Caesar: who being few in number, and overpowered by the multitude of 
<A NAME="235"></A>the enemy, were forced to give ground a little, their horses being much 
<A NAME="236"></A>wounded. The enemy pressed on more and more; so that in an instant, the 
<A NAME="237"></A>legions, being surrounded on all sides by the enemy's cavalry, were obliged 
<A NAME="238"></A>to form themselves into a circle, and fight, as if inclosed with 
<A NAME="239"></A>barriers.
<A NAME="240"></A><BR><BR>Chapter 16
<A NAME="241"></A><BR><BR>Labienus, with his head uncovered, advanced on horseback to the 
<A NAME="242"></A>front of the battle, sometimes encouraging his own men, sometimes addressing 
<A NAME="243"></A>Caesar's legions thus: "So ho! you raw soldiers there!" says he, "why so 
<A NAME="244"></A>fierce? Has he infatuated you too with his words? Truly he has brought 
<A NAME="245"></A>you into a fine condition! I pity you sincerely." Upon this, one of the 
<A NAME="246"></A>soldiers said: "I am none of your raw warriors, Labienus, but a veteran 
<A NAME="247"></A>of the tenth legion." " Where's your standard?" replied Labienus. " I'll 
<A NAME="248"></A>soon make you sensible who I am," answered the soldier. Then pulling off 
<A NAME="249"></A>his helmet, to discover himself, he threw a javelin, with all his strength 
<A NAME="250"></A>at Labienus, which wounding his horse severely in the breast - "Know, Labienus," 
<A NAME="251"></A>says he, "that this dart was thrown by a soldier of the tenth legion." 
<A NAME="252"></A>However, the whole army was not a little daunted, especially the new levies; 
<A NAME="253"></A>and began to cast their eyes upon Caesar, minding nothing, for the present, 
<A NAME="254"></A>but to defend themselves from the enemy's darts.
<A NAME="255"></A><BR><BR>Chapter 17
<A NAME="256"></A><BR><BR>Caesar meanwhile, perceiving the enemy's design, endeavored to 
<A NAME="257"></A>extend his line of battle, as much as possible, directing the cohorts to 
<A NAME="258"></A>face about alternately to the right and left. By this means, he broke the 
<A NAME="259"></A>enemy's circle with his right and left wings; and attacking one part of 
<A NAME="260"></A>them, thus separated from the other, with his horse and foot, at last put 
<A NAME="261"></A>them to flight. He pursued them but a little way, fearing an ambuscade, 
<A NAME="262"></A>and returned again to his own men. The same was done by the other division 
<A NAME="263"></A>of Caesar's horse and foot, so that the enemy being driven back, and severely 
<A NAME="264"></A>wounded on all sides, he retreated toward his camp, in order of 
<A NAME="265"></A>battle.
<A NAME="266"></A><BR><BR>Chapter 18
<A NAME="267"></A><BR><BR>Meantime M. Petreius, and Cn. Piso, with eleven hundred select 
<A NAME="268"></A>Numidian horse, and a considerable body of foot, arrived to the assistance 
<A NAME="269"></A>of the enemy; who, recovering from their terror, upon this reinforcement, 
<A NAME="270"></A>and again resuming courage, fell upon the rear of the legions, as they 
<A NAME="271"></A>retreated, and endeavored to hinder them from reaching their camp. Caesar, 
<A NAME="272"></A>perceiving this, ordered his men to wheel about, and renew the battle in 
<A NAME="273"></A>the middle of the plain. As the enemy still pursued their former plan, 
<A NAME="274"></A>and avoided a closing engagement, and the horses of Caesar's cavalry had 
<A NAME="275"></A>not yet recovered the fatigue of their late voyage, and were besides weakened 
<A NAME="276"></A>with thirst, weariness, wounds, and of course unfit for a vigorous and 
<A NAME="277"></A>long pursuit, which even the time of the day would not allow, he ordered 
<A NAME="278"></A>both horse and foot to fall at once briskly upon the enemy, and not slacken 
<A NAME="279"></A>the pursuit till they had driven them quite beyond the furthest hills, 
<A NAME="280"></A>and taken possession of them themselves. Accordingly, upon a signal being 
<A NAME="281"></A>given, when the enemy were throwing their javelins in a faint and careless 
<A NAME="282"></A>manner, he suddenly charged them with his horse and foot; who in a moment 
<A NAME="283"></A>driving them from the field, and over the adjoining hill, kept possession 
<A NAME="284"></A>of that post for some time, and then retired slowly, in order of battle, 
<A NAME="285"></A>to their camp. The enemy, who, in this last attack, had been very roughly 
<A NAME="286"></A>handled, then at length retreated to their fortifications.
<A NAME="287"></A><BR><BR>Chapter 19
<A NAME="288"></A><BR><BR>Meanwhile the action being over, a great number of deserters, of 
<A NAME="289"></A>all kinds, flocked to Caesar's camp, besides multitudes of horse and foot 
<A NAME="290"></A>that were made prisoners. From them we learned that it was the design of 
<A NAME="291"></A>the enemy to have astonished our raw troops, with their new and uncommon 
<A NAME="292"></A>manner of fighting; and after surrounding them with their cavalry, to have 
<A NAME="293"></A>cut them to pieces, as they had done Curio; and that they had marched against 
<A NAME="294"></A>us expressly with that intention. Labienus had even said, in the council 
<A NAME="295"></A>of war, that he would lead such a numerous body of auxiliaries against 
<A NAME="296"></A>his adversaries, as should fatigue us with the very slaughter, and defeat 
<A NAME="297"></A>us even in the bosom of victory; for he relied more on the number than 
<A NAME="298"></A>the valor of his troops. He had heard of the mutiny of the veteran legions 
<A NAME="299"></A>at Rome, and their refusal to go into Africa; and was likewise well assured 
<A NAME="300"></A>of the fidelity of his troops, who had served three years under him in 
<A NAME="301"></A>Africa. He had a great number of Numidian cavalry and light-armed troops, 
<A NAME="302"></A>besides the Gallic and German horse, whom he had drawn together out of 
<A NAME="303"></A>the remains of Pompey's army, and carried over with him from Brundusium: 
<A NAME="304"></A>he had likewise the freed men raised in the country, and trained to use 
<A NAME="305"></A>bridled horses; and also the immense number of Juba's forces, his hundred 
<A NAME="306"></A>and twenty elephants, his innumerable cavalry and legionaries, amounting 
<A NAME="307"></A>to above twelve thousand. Emboldened by the hope such mighty forces raised 
<A NAME="308"></A>in him, on the day before the nones of January, three days after Caesar's 
<A NAME="309"></A>arrival, he came against him, with sixteen hundred Gallic and German horse, 
<A NAME="310"></A>nine hundred under Petreius, eight thousand Numidians, four times that 
<A NAME="311"></A>number of light-armed foot, with a multitude of archers and slingers. The 
<A NAME="312"></A>battle lasted from the fifth hour till sunset, during which time Petreius, 
<A NAME="313"></A>receiving a dangerous wound, was obliged to quit the 
<A NAME="314"></A>field.
<A NAME="315"></A><BR><BR>Chapter 20
<A NAME="316"></A><BR><BR>Meantime Caesar fortified his camp with much greater care, reinforced 
<A NAME="317"></A>the guards, and threw up two intrenchments; one from Ruspina quite to the 
<A NAME="318"></A>sea, the other from his camp to the sea likewise, to secure the communication, 
<A NAME="319"></A>and receive supplies without danger. He landed a great number darts and 
<A NAME="320"></A>military engines, armed part of the mariners, Gauls, Rhodians, and others, 
<A NAME="321"></A>that after the example of the enemy he might have a number of light-armed 
<A NAME="322"></A>troops to intermix with his cavalry. He likewise strengthened his army 
<A NAME="323"></A>with a great number of Syrian and Iturean archers whom he drew from the 
<A NAME="324"></A>fleet into his camp: for he understood that within three days Scipio was 
<A NAME="325"></A>expected to unite his forces to Labienus and Petreius, and his army was 
<A NAME="326"></A>said to consist of eight legions and three thousand horse. At the same 
<A NAME="327"></A>time he established workshops, made a great number of darts and arrows, 
<A NAME="328"></A>provided himself with leaden bullets and palisades, wrote to Sicily for 
<A NAME="329"></A>hurdles and wood to make rams, because he had none in Africa, and likewise 
<A NAME="330"></A>gave orders for sending corn; for the harvest in that country was like 
<A NAME="331"></A>to be inconsiderable, the enemy having taken all the laborers into their 
<A NAME="332"></A>service the year before, and stored up the grain in a few fortified towns, 
<A NAME="333"></A>after demolishing the rest, forcing the inhabitants into the garrisoned 
<A NAME="334"></A>places, and exhausting the whole country.
<A NAME="335"></A><BR><BR>Chapter 21
<A NAME="336"></A><BR><BR>In this necessity, by paying court to private individuals, he obtained 
<A NAME="337"></A>a small supply, and husbanded it with care. In the mean time he went round 
<A NAME="338"></A>the works in person daily, and kept about four cohorts constantly on duty, 
<A NAME="339"></A>on account of the multitude of the enemy. Labienus sent his sick and wounded, 
<A NAME="340"></A>of which the number was very considerable, in wagons to Adrumetum. Meanwhile 
<A NAME="341"></A>Caesar's transports, unacquainted with the coast, or where their general 
<A NAME="342"></A>had landed wandered up and down in great uncertainty; and being, attacked, 
<A NAME="343"></A>one after another, by the enemy's coasters, were, for the most part, either 
<A NAME="344"></A>taken or burned. Caesar, being informed of this, stationed his fleet along 
<A NAME="345"></A>the coast and islands for the security of his convoys.
<A NAME="346"></A><BR><BR>Chapter 22
<A NAME="347"></A><BR><BR>Meanwhile M. Cato, who commanded in Utica, never ceased urging 
<A NAME="348"></A>and exhorting young Pompey, in words to this effect: "Your father, when 
<A NAME="349"></A>he was at your age, and observed the commonwealth oppressed by wicked and 
<A NAME="350"></A>daring men, and the party of order either slain or driven into banishment 
<A NAME="351"></A>from their country and relations, incited by the greatness of his mind 
<A NAME="352"></A>and the love of glory, though then very young, and only a private man, 
<A NAME="353"></A>had yet the courage to rally the remains of his father's army, and assert 
<A NAME="354"></A>the freedom of Italy and Rome, which was almost crushed forever. He also 
<A NAME="355"></A>recovered Sicily, Africa, Numidia, Mauritania, with amazing dispatch, and 
<A NAME="356"></A>by that means gained an illustrious and extensive reputation among all 
<A NAME="357"></A>nations, and triumphed while very young and only a Roman knight. Nor did 
<A NAME="358"></A>he enter upon the administration of public affairs, distinguished by the 
<A NAME="359"></A>shining exploits of his father, or the fame and reputation of his ancestors, 
<A NAME="360"></A>or the honors and dignities of the state. Will you, on the contrary, possessed 
<A NAME="361"></A>of these honors, and the reputation acquired by your father, sufficiently 
<A NAME="362"></A>distinguished by your own industry and greatness of mind, not bestir yourself, 
<A NAME="363"></A>join your father's friends, and give the earnestly required assistance 
<A NAME="364"></A>to yourself, the republic, and every man of worth?"
<A NAME="365"></A><BR><BR>Chapter 23
<A NAME="366"></A><BR><BR>The youth, roused by the remonstrances of that grave and worthy 
<A NAME="367"></A>senator, got together about thirty sail, of all sorts, of which some few 
<A NAME="368"></A>were ships of war, and sailing from Utica to Mauritania, invaded the kingdom 
<A NAME="369"></A>of Bogud. And leaving his baggage behind him, with an army of two thousand 
<A NAME="370"></A>men, partly freedmen, partly slaves, some armed, some not, approached the 
<A NAME="371"></A>town of Ascurum, in which the king had a garrison. On the arrival of Pompey, 
<A NAME="372"></A>the inhabitants suffered him to advance to the very walls and gates; when, 
<A NAME="373"></A>suddenly sallying out, they drove back his troops in confusion and dismay 
<A NAME="374"></A>to the sea and their ships. This ill-success determined him to leave that 
<A NAME="375"></A>coast, nor did he afterward land in any place, but steered directly for 
<A NAME="376"></A>the Balearean Isles.
<A NAME="377"></A><BR><BR>Chapter 24
<A NAME="378"></A><BR><BR>Meantime Scipio, leaving a strong garrison at Utica, began his 
<A NAME="379"></A>march, with the forces we have described above, and encamped first at Adrumetum; 
<A NAME="380"></A>and then, after a stay of a few days, setting out in the night, he joined 
<A NAME="381"></A>Petreius and Labienus, lodging all the forces in one camp, about three 
<A NAME="382"></A>miles distant from Caesar's. Their cavalry made continual excursions to 
<A NAME="383"></A>our very works, and intercepted those who ventured too far in quest of 
<A NAME="384"></A>wood or water, and obliged us to keep within our intrenchments. This soon 
<A NAME="385"></A>occasioned a great scarcity of provision among Caesar's men, because no 
<A NAME="386"></A>supplies had yet arrived from Sicily and Sardinia. The season, too, was 
<A NAME="387"></A>dangerous for navigation, and he did not possess above six miles in each 
<A NAME="388"></A>direction, in Africa, and was moreover greatly distressed for want of forage. 
<A NAME="389"></A>The veteran soldiers and cavalry, who had been engaged in many wars both 
<A NAME="390"></A>by sea and land, and often struggled with wants and misfortunes of this 
<A NAME="391"></A>kind, gathering sea-weed, and washing it in fresh water, by that means 
<A NAME="392"></A>subsisted their horses and cattle.
<A NAME="393"></A><BR><BR>Chapter 25
<A NAME="394"></A><BR><BR>While things were in this situation, king Juba, being informed 
<A NAME="395"></A>of Caesar's difficulties, and the few troops he had with him, resolved 
<A NAME="396"></A>not to allow him time to remedy his wants or increase his forces. Accordingly 
<A NAME="397"></A>he left his kingdom, at the head of a large body of horse and foot, and 
<A NAME="398"></A>marched to join his allies. Meantime P. Sitius, and king Bogud, having 
<A NAME="399"></A>intelligence of Juba's march, joined their forces, entered Numidia, and 
<A NAME="400"></A>laying siege to Cirta, the most opulent city in the county, carried it 
<A NAME="401"></A>in a few days, with two others belonging to the Getulians. They had offered 
<A NAME="402"></A>the inhabitants leave to depart in safety, if they would peaceably deliver 
<A NAME="403"></A>up the town; but these conditions being rejected, they were taken by storm, 
<A NAME="404"></A>and the citizens all put to the sword. They continued to advance, and incessantly 
<A NAME="405"></A>harassed the cities and country; of which Juba having intelligence, though 
<A NAME="406"></A>he was upon the point of joining Scipio and the other chiefs, determined 
<A NAME="407"></A>that it was better to march to the relief of his own kingdom, than run 
<A NAME="408"></A>the hazard of being driven from it while he was assisting others, and, 
<A NAME="409"></A>perhaps, after all, miscarry too in his designs against Caesar. He therefore 
<A NAME="410"></A>retired, with his troops, leaving only thirty elephants behind him, and 
<A NAME="411"></A>marched to the relief of his own cities and territories.
<A NAME="412"></A><BR><BR>Chapter 26
<A NAME="413"></A><BR><BR>Meanwhile Caesar, as there was a doubt in the province concerning 
<A NAME="414"></A>his arrival, and no one believed that he had come in person, but that some 
<A NAME="415"></A>of his lieutenants had come over with the forces lately sent, dispatched 
<A NAME="416"></A>letters to all the several states, to inform them of his presence. Upon 
<A NAME="417"></A>this, many persons of rank fled to his camp, complaining of the barbarity 
<A NAME="418"></A>and cruelty of the enemy. Caesar deeply touched by their tears and complaints, 
<A NAME="419"></A>although before he had remained inactive, resolved to take the field as 
<A NAME="420"></A>soon as the weather would permit, and he could draw his troops together. 
<A NAME="421"></A>He immediately dispatched letters into Sicily, to Allienus and Rabirius 
<A NAME="422"></A>Posthumus the praetors [to tell them] that without delay or excuse, either 
<A NAME="423"></A>of the winter or the winds, they must send over the rest of the troops, 
<A NAME="424"></A>to save Africa from utter ruin; because, without some speedy remedy, not 
<A NAME="425"></A>a single house would be left standing, nor any thing escape the fury and 
<A NAME="426"></A>ravages of the enemy. And he himself was so anxious and impatient, that 
<A NAME="427"></A>from the day the letters were sent, he complained without ceasing of the 
<A NAME="428"></A>delay of the fleet, and had his eyes night and day turned toward the sea. 
<A NAME="429"></A>Nor was it wonderful; for he saw the villages burned, the country laid 
<A NAME="430"></A>waste, the cattle destroyed, the towns plundered, the principal citizens 
<A NAME="431"></A>either slain or put in chains, and their children dragged into servitude 
<A NAME="432"></A>under the name of hostages; nor could he, amid all this scene of misery, 
<A NAME="433"></A>afford any relief to those who implored his protection, on account of the 
<A NAME="434"></A>small number of his forces. In the mean time he kept the soldiers incessantly 
<A NAME="435"></A>at work upon the intrenchments, built forts and redoubts, and carried on 
<A NAME="436"></A>his lines quite to the sea.
<A NAME="437"></A><BR><BR>Chapter 27
<A NAME="438"></A><BR><BR>Meanwhile Scipio made use of the following contrivance for training 
<A NAME="439"></A>and disciplining his elephants. He drew up two parties in order of battle; 
<A NAME="440"></A>one of slingers, who were to act as enemies, and discharge small stones 
<A NAME="441"></A>against the elephants: and fronting them, the elephants themselves, in 
<A NAME="442"></A>one line, and his whole army behind him in battle-array; that when the 
<A NAME="443"></A>enemy, by their discharge of stones, had frightened the elephants, and 
<A NAME="444"></A>forced them to turn upon their own men, they might again be made to face 
<A NAME="445"></A>the enemy, by the volleys of stones from the army behind them. The work 
<A NAME="446"></A>however, went on but slowly, because these animals, after many years' training, 
<A NAME="447"></A>are dangerous to both parties when brought into the 
<A NAME="448"></A>field.
<A NAME="449"></A><BR><BR>Chapter 28
<A NAME="450"></A><BR><BR>While the two generals were thus employed near Ruspina, C. Virgilius, 
<A NAME="451"></A>a man of praetorian rank, who commanded in Thapsus, a maritime city, observing 
<A NAME="452"></A>some of Caesar's transports that had missed their way, uncertain where 
<A NAME="453"></A>Caesar had landed or held his camp; and thinking that a fair opportunity 
<A NAME="454"></A>offered of destroying them, manned a galley that was in the port with soldiers 
<A NAME="455"></A>and archers, and joining with it a few armed barks, began to pursue Caesar's 
<A NAME="456"></A>ships. Though he was repulsed on several occasions he still pursued his 
<A NAME="457"></A>design, and at last fell in with one, on board of which were two young 
<A NAME="458"></A>Spaniards, of the name of Titius, who were tribunes of the fifth legion, 
<A NAME="459"></A>and whose father had been made a senator by Caesar. There was with them 
<A NAME="460"></A>a centurion of the same legion, T. Salienus by name, who had invested the 
<A NAME="461"></A>house of M. Messala, Caesar's lieutenant, at Messana, and made use of very 
<A NAME="462"></A>seditious language; nay, had even seized the money and ornaments destined 
<A NAME="463"></A>for Caesar's triumph, and for that reason dreaded his resentment. He, conscious 
<A NAME="464"></A>of his demerits, persuaded the young men to surrender themselves to Virgilius, 
<A NAME="465"></A>by whom they were sent under a strong guard to Scipio, and three days after 
<A NAME="466"></A>put to death. It is said, that the elder Titius begged of the centurions 
<A NAME="467"></A>who were charged with the execution, that he might be first put to death; 
<A NAME="468"></A>which being easily granted, they both suffered according to their 
<A NAME="469"></A>sentence.
<A NAME="470"></A><BR><BR>Chapter 29
<A NAME="471"></A><BR><BR>The cavalry that mounted guard in the two camps were continually 
<A NAME="472"></A>skirmishing with one another. Sometimes too the German and Gallic cavalry 
<A NAME="473"></A>of Labienus entered into discourse with those of Caesar, after promising 
<A NAME="474"></A>not to injure one another. Meantime Labienus, with a party of horse, endeavored 
<A NAME="475"></A>to surprise the town of Leptis, which Saserna guarded with three cohorts; 
<A NAME="476"></A>but was easily repulsed, because the town was strongly fortified, and well 
<A NAME="477"></A>provided with warlike engines; he however renewed the attempt several times. 
<A NAME="478"></A>One day, as a strong squadron of the enemy had posted themselves before 
<A NAME="479"></A>the gate, their officer being slain by an arrow discharged from a cross-bow, 
<A NAME="480"></A>and pinned to his own shield, the rest were terrified and took to flight; 
<A NAME="481"></A>by which means the town was delivered from any further 
<A NAME="482"></A>attempts.
<A NAME="483"></A><BR><BR>Chapter 30
<A NAME="484"></A><BR><BR>At the same time Scipio daily drew up his troops in order of battle, 
<A NAME="485"></A>about three hundred paces from his camp; and after continuing in arms the 
<A NAME="486"></A>greatest part of the day, retreated again to his camp in the evening. This 
<A NAME="487"></A>he did several times, no one mean while offering to stir out of Caesar's 
<A NAME="488"></A>camp, or approach his forces; which forbearance and tranquillity gave him 
<A NAME="489"></A>such a contempt of Caesar and his army, that drawing out all his forces, 
<A NAME="490"></A>and his thirty elephants, with towers on their backs, and extending his 
<A NAME="491"></A>horse and foot as wide as possible, he approached quite up to Caesar's 
<A NAME="492"></A>intrenchments.
<A NAME="493"></A><BR><BR>Chapter 31
<A NAME="494"></A><BR><BR>Upon perceiving this, Caesar, quietly, and without noise or confusion, 
<A NAME="495"></A>recalled to his camp all that were gone out either in quest of forage, 
<A NAME="496"></A>wood, or to work upon the fortifications: he likewise ordered the cavalry 
<A NAME="497"></A>that were upon guard not to quit their post until the enemy were within 
<A NAME="498"></A>reach of dart; and if they then persisted in advancing, to retire in good 
<A NAME="499"></A>order within the intrenchments. He ordered the rest of the cavalry to be 
<A NAME="500"></A>ready and armed, each in his own place. These orders were not given by 
<A NAME="501"></A>himself in person, or after viewing the disposition of the enemy from the 
<A NAME="502"></A>rampart; but such was his consummate knowledge of the art of war, that 
<A NAME="503"></A>he gave all the necessary directions by his officers, he himself sitting 
<A NAME="504"></A>in his tent, and informing himself of the motions of the enemy by his scouts. 
<A NAME="505"></A>He very well knew, that, whatever confidence the enemy might have in their 
<A NAME="506"></A>numbers, they would yet never dare to attack the camp of a general who 
<A NAME="507"></A>had so often repulsed, terrified, and put them to flight; who had frequently 
<A NAME="508"></A>pardoned and granted them their lives; and whose very name had weight and 
<A NAME="509"></A>authority enough to intimidate their army. He was besides well intrenched 
<A NAME="510"></A>with a high rampart and deep ditch, the approaches to which were rendered 
<A NAME="511"></A>so difficult by the sharp spikes which he had disposed in a very skillful 
<A NAME="512"></A>manner, that they were even sufficient of themselves to keep off the enemy. 
<A NAME="513"></A>He had also a large supply of cross-bows, engines, and all sorts of weapons 
<A NAME="514"></A>necessary for a vigorous defense, which he had prepared on account of the 
<A NAME="515"></A>fewness of his troops, and the inexperience of his new levies. It was not 
<A NAME="516"></A>owing to being influenced by the fear of the enemy or their numerical strength, 
<A NAME="517"></A>that he allowed himself to appear daunted in their estimation. And it was 
<A NAME="518"></A>not owing to his having any doubts of gaining the victory that he did not 
<A NAME="519"></A>lead his troops to action, although they were raw and few, but he thought 
<A NAME="520"></A>that it was a matter of great importance, what sort the victory should 
<A NAME="521"></A>be: for he thought that it would disgrace him, if after so many noble exploits, 
<A NAME="522"></A>and defeating such powerful armies, and after gaining so many glorious 
<A NAME="523"></A>victories, he should appear to have gained a bloody victory over the remnants 
<A NAME="524"></A>who had rallied after their flight. He determined, in consequence of this, 
<A NAME="525"></A>to endure the pride and exultation of his enemies, until some portion of 
<A NAME="526"></A>his veteran legion should arrive in the second embarkation.
<A NAME="527"></A><BR><BR>Chapter 32
<A NAME="528"></A><BR><BR>Scipio, after a short stay before the intrenchments, as if in contempt 
<A NAME="529"></A>of Caesar, withdrew slowly to his camp: and having called the soldiers 
<A NAME="530"></A>together, enlarged upon the terror and despair of the enemy, when encouraging 
<A NAME="531"></A>his men, he assured them of a complete victory in a short time. Caesar 
<A NAME="532"></A>made his soldiers again return to the works, and under pretense of fortifying 
<A NAME="533"></A>his camp, inured the new levies to labor and fatigue. Meantime the Numidians 
<A NAME="534"></A>and Getulians deserted daily from Scipio's camp. Part returned home; part 
<A NAME="535"></A>came over to Caesar, because they understood he was related to C. Marius, 
<A NAME="536"></A>from whom their ancestors had received considerable favors. Of these he 
<A NAME="537"></A>selected some of distinguished rank, and sent them home, with letters to 
<A NAME="538"></A>their countrymen, exhorting them to levy troops for their own defense, 
<A NAME="539"></A>and not to listen to the suggestions of his enemies.
<A NAME="540"></A><BR><BR>Chapter 33
<A NAME="541"></A><BR><BR>While these things were passing near Ruspina, deputies from Acilla, 
<A NAME="542"></A>a free town, and all the neighboring towns, arrived in Caesar's camp, and 
<A NAME="543"></A>promised "to be ready to execute Caesar's commands, and to do so withal, 
<A NAME="544"></A>and that they only begged and requested of him to give them garrisons, 
<A NAME="545"></A>that they might do so in safety and without danger to themselves, that 
<A NAME="546"></A>they would furnish them with corn and whatever supplies they had, to secure 
<A NAME="547"></A>the common safety. Caesar readily complied with their demands, and having 
<A NAME="548"></A>assigned a garrison, sent C. Messius, who had been aedile, to command in 
<A NAME="549"></A>Acilla. Upon intelligence of this, Considius Longus, who was at Adrumetum 
<A NAME="550"></A>with two legions and seven hundred horse, leaving a garrison in that city, 
<A NAME="551"></A>hastened to Acilla at the head of eight cohorts: but Messius, having accomplished 
<A NAME="552"></A>his march with great expedition, arrived there before him. When Considius, 
<A NAME="553"></A>therefore, approached, and found Caesar's garrison in possession of the 
<A NAME="554"></A>town, not daring to make any attempt, he returned again to Adrumetum. But 
<A NAME="555"></A>some days after, Labienus having sent him a reinforcement of horse, he 
<A NAME="556"></A>began to besiege the town.
<A NAME="557"></A><BR><BR>Chapter 34
<A NAME="558"></A><BR><BR>Much about the same time, C. Sallustius Crispus, who, as we have 
<A NAME="559"></A>seen, had been sent a few days before to Cercina with a fleet, arrived 
<A NAME="560"></A>in that island. Upon his arrival, C. Decimus the quaestor, who, with a 
<A NAME="561"></A>strong party of his own domestics, had charge of the magazines erected 
<A NAME="562"></A>there, went on board a small vessel and fled. Sallustius meanwhile was 
<A NAME="563"></A>well received by the Cercinates, and finding great store of corn in the 
<A NAME="564"></A>island, loaded all the ships then in the port, whose number was very considerable, 
<A NAME="565"></A>and dispatched them to Caesar's camp. At the same time Allienus, the proconsul, 
<A NAME="566"></A>put on board of the transports at Lilybaeum the thirteenth and fourteenth 
<A NAME="567"></A>legions, with eight hundred Gallic horse and a thousand archers and slingers, 
<A NAME="568"></A>and sent the second embarkation to Africa, to Caesar. This fleet meeting 
<A NAME="569"></A>with a favorable wind, arrived in four days at Ruspina, where Caesar had 
<A NAME="570"></A>his camp. Thus he experienced a double pleasure on this occasion, receiving 
<A NAME="571"></A>at one and the same time, both a supply of provisions and a reinforcement 
<A NAME="572"></A>of troops, which animated the soldiers, and delivered them from the apprehensions 
<A NAME="573"></A>of want. Having landed the legions and cavalry, he allowed them some time 
<A NAME="574"></A>to recover from the fatigue and sickness of their voyage, and then distributed 
<A NAME="575"></A>them into the forts, and along the works.
<A NAME="576"></A><BR><BR>Chapter 35
<A NAME="577"></A><BR><BR>Scipio and the other generals were greatly surprised at this conduct, 
<A NAME="578"></A>and could not conceive why Caesar, who had always been forward and active 
<A NAME="579"></A>in war, should all of a sudden change his measures; which they therefore 
<A NAME="580"></A>suspected must proceed from some very powerful reasons. Uneasy and disturbed 
<A NAME="581"></A>to see him so patient, they made choice of two Getulians, on whose fidelity 
<A NAME="582"></A>they thought they could rely; and promising them great rewards, sent them, 
<A NAME="583"></A>under the name of deserters, to get intelligence of Caesar's designs. When 
<A NAME="584"></A>they were brought before him, they begged they might have leave to speak 
<A NAME="585"></A>without personal danger, which being granted, "It is now a long time, great 
<A NAME="586"></A>general," said they, "since many of us Getulians, clients of C. Marius, 
<A NAME="587"></A>and almost all Roman citizens of the fourth and sixth legions, have wished 
<A NAME="588"></A>for an opportunity to come over to you; but have hitherto been prevented 
<A NAME="589"></A>by the guards of Numidian horse, from doing it without great risk. Now 
<A NAME="590"></A>we gladly embrace the occasion, being sent by Scipio under the name of 
<A NAME="591"></A>deserters, to discover what ditches and traps you have prepared for his 
<A NAME="592"></A>elephants, how you intended to oppose these animals, and what dispositions 
<A NAME="593"></A>you are making for battle." They were praised by Caesar, and liberally 
<A NAME="594"></A>rewarded, and sent to the other deserters. We had soon a proof of the truth 
<A NAME="595"></A>of what they had advanced; for the next day a great many soldiers of these 
<A NAME="596"></A>legions, mentioned by the Getulians, deserted to Caesar's 
<A NAME="597"></A>camp.
<A NAME="598"></A><BR><BR>Chapter 36
<A NAME="599"></A><BR><BR>While affairs were in this posture at Ruspina, M. Cato, who commanded 
<A NAME="600"></A>in Utica, was daily enlisting freed-men, Africans, slaves, and all that 
<A NAME="601"></A>were of age to bear arms, and sending them without intermission to Scipio's 
<A NAME="602"></A>camp. Meanwhile deputies from the town of Tisdra came to Caesar to inform 
<A NAME="603"></A>him, that some Italian merchants had brought three hundred thousand bushels 
<A NAME="604"></A>of corn into that city, and to demand a garrison as well for their own 
<A NAME="605"></A>defense as to secure the corn. Caesar thanked the deputies, promised to 
<A NAME="606"></A>send the garrison they desired, and having encouraged them, sent them back 
<A NAME="607"></A>to their fellow-citizens. Meantime P. Sitius entered Numidia with his troops, 
<A NAME="608"></A>and took by storm a castle situated on a mountain, where Juba had laid 
<A NAME="609"></A>up a great quantity of provisions, and other things necessary for carrying 
<A NAME="610"></A>on the war.
<A NAME="611"></A><BR><BR>Chapter 37
<A NAME="612"></A><BR><BR>Caesar, having increased his forces with two veteran legions, and 
<A NAME="613"></A>all the cavalry and light-armed troops that had arrived in the second embarkation, 
<A NAME="614"></A>detached six transports to Lilybaeum, to bring over the rest of the army. 
<A NAME="615"></A>He himself on the sixth day before the calends of February, ordering the 
<A NAME="616"></A>scouts and lictors to attend him at six in the evening, drew out all the 
<A NAME="617"></A>legions at midnight, and directed his march toward Ruspina, where he had 
<A NAME="618"></A>a garrison, and which had first declared in his favor, no one knowing or 
<A NAME="619"></A>having the least suspicion of his design. Thence he continued his route, 
<A NAME="620"></A>by the left of the camp, along the sea, and passed a little declivity, 
<A NAME="621"></A>which opened into a fine plain, extending fifteen miles, and bordering 
<A NAME="622"></A>upon a chain of mountains of moderate height, that formed a kind of theater. 
<A NAME="623"></A>In this ridge were some hills that rose higher than the rest, on which 
<A NAME="624"></A>forts and watchtowers had formerly been erected, and at the furthest of 
<A NAME="625"></A>which, Scipio's guards and out-posts were stationed.
<A NAME="626"></A><BR><BR>Chapter 38
<A NAME="627"></A><BR><BR>After Caesar gained the ridge, which I have just mentioned, and 
<A NAME="628"></A>began to raise redoubts upon the several eminences (which he executed in 
<A NAME="629"></A>less than half an hour), and when he was not very far from the last, which 
<A NAME="630"></A>bordered on the enemy's camp, and where, as we have said, Scipio had his 
<A NAME="631"></A>out-guard of Numidians, he stopped a moment; and having taken a view of 
<A NAME="632"></A>the ground, and posted his cavalry in the most commodious situation, he 
<A NAME="633"></A>ordered the legions to throw up an intrenchment along the middle of the 
<A NAME="634"></A>ridge, from the place at which he was arrived to that whence he set out. 
<A NAME="635"></A>When Scipio and Labienus observed this, they drew all their cavalry out 
<A NAME="636"></A>of the camp, formed them in order of battle, and advancing about a mile, 
<A NAME="637"></A>posted their infantry by way of a second line, somewhat less than half 
<A NAME="638"></A>a mile from their camp.
<A NAME="639"></A><BR><BR>Chapter 39
<A NAME="640"></A><BR><BR>Caesar was unmoved by the appearance of the enemy's forces, and 
<A NAME="641"></A>encouraged his men to go on with the work. But when he perceived that they 
<A NAME="642"></A>were within fifteen hundred paces of the intrenchment, and saw that the 
<A NAME="643"></A>enemy were coming nearer to interrupt and disturb the soldiers and oblige 
<A NAME="644"></A>him to draw off the legions from the work, he ordered a squadron of Spanish 
<A NAME="645"></A>cavalry, supported by some light-armed infantry, to attack the Numidian 
<A NAME="646"></A>guard upon the nearest eminence, and drive them from that post. They accordingly, 
<A NAME="647"></A>advancing rapidly, attacked the Numidian cavalry: they took some of them 
<A NAME="648"></A>alive, severely wounded several in their flight, and made themselves masters 
<A NAME="649"></A>of the place. This being observed by Labienus, he wheeled off almost the 
<A NAME="650"></A>whole right wing of the horse, that he might the more effectually succor 
<A NAME="651"></A>the fugitives. Caesar waited till he was at a considerable distance from 
<A NAME="652"></A>his own men, and then detached his left wing to intercept the 
<A NAME="653"></A>enemy.
<A NAME="654"></A><BR><BR>Chapter 40
<A NAME="655"></A><BR><BR>In the plain where this happened was a large villa, with four turrets, 
<A NAME="656"></A>which prevented Labienus from seeing that he was intercepted by Caesar's 
<A NAME="657"></A>cavalry. He had therefore no apprehension of the approach of Caesar's horse 
<A NAME="658"></A>till he found himself charged in the rear; which struck such a sudden terror 
<A NAME="659"></A>into the Numidian cavalry that they immediately betook themselves to flight. 
<A NAME="660"></A>The Gauls and Germans who stood their ground, being surrounded on all sides, 
<A NAME="661"></A>were entirely cut off. This being perceived by Scipio's legions, who were 
<A NAME="662"></A>drawn up in order of battle before the camp, they fled in the utmost terror 
<A NAME="663"></A>and confusion. Scipio and his forces being driven from the plain and the 
<A NAME="664"></A>hills, Caesar sounded a retreat, and ordered all the cavalry to retire 
<A NAME="665"></A>behind the works. When the field was cleared, he could not forbear admiring 
<A NAME="666"></A>the huge bodies of the Gauls and Germans, who had been partly induced by 
<A NAME="667"></A>the authority of Labienus to follow him out of Gaul, and partly drawn over 
<A NAME="668"></A>by promises and rewards. Some being made prisoners in the battle with Curio, 
<A NAME="669"></A>and having their lives granted them, continued faithful out of gratitude. 
<A NAME="670"></A>Their bodies, of surprising symmetry and size, lay scattered all over the 
<A NAME="671"></A>plain.
<A NAME="672"></A><BR><BR>Chapter 41
<A NAME="673"></A><BR><BR>Next day, Caesar drew all his forces together, and formed them 
<A NAME="674"></A>in order of battle upon the plain. Scipio, discouraged by so unexpected 
<A NAME="675"></A>a check, and the number of his wounded and slain, kept within his lines. 
<A NAME="676"></A>Caesar, with his army in battle array, marched along the roots of the hills, 
<A NAME="677"></A>and gradually approached his trenches. Caesar's legions were, by this time, 
<A NAME="678"></A>not more than a mile from Uzita, a town possessed by Scipio, when the latter, 
<A NAME="679"></A>fearing lest he should lose the town, whence he procured water and other 
<A NAME="680"></A>conveniences for his army, resolved therefore to preserve it, at all hazards, 
<A NAME="681"></A>and brought forth his whole army, and drew them up in four lines, forming 
<A NAME="682"></A>the first of cavalry, supported by elephants with castles on their backs. 
<A NAME="683"></A>Caesar believing that Scipio approached with the intention of giving battle, 
<A NAME="684"></A>continued where he was posted, not far from the town. Scipio meanwhile, 
<A NAME="685"></A>having the town in the center of his front, extended his two wings, where 
<A NAME="686"></A>were his elephants, in full view of our army.
<A NAME="687"></A><BR><BR>Chapter 42
<A NAME="688"></A><BR><BR>When Caesar had waited till sunset, without finding that Scipio 
<A NAME="689"></A>stirred from his post, who seemed rather disposed to defend himself by 
<A NAME="690"></A>his advantageous situation, than hazard a battle in the open field, he 
<A NAME="691"></A>did not think proper to advance further that day, because the enemy had 
<A NAME="692"></A>a strong garrison of Numidians in the town, which besides covered the center 
<A NAME="693"></A>of their front: and he foresaw great difficulty in forming, at the same 
<A NAME="694"></A>time, an attack upon the town, and opposing their right and left, with 
<A NAME="695"></A>the advantage of the ground; especially as the soldiers had continued under 
<A NAME="696"></A>arms and fasted since morning. Having therefore led back his troops to 
<A NAME="697"></A>their camp, he resolved next day to extend his lines nearer the 
<A NAME="698"></A>town.
<A NAME="699"></A><BR><BR>Chapter 43
<A NAME="700"></A><BR><BR>Meantime Considius, who was besieging eight mercenary cohorts of 
<A NAME="701"></A>Numidians and Getulians in Acilla, where P. Messius commanded, after continuing 
<A NAME="702"></A>long before the place, and seeing all his works burned and destroyed by 
<A NAME="703"></A>the enemy, upon the report of the late battle of the cavalry, set fire 
<A NAME="704"></A>to is corn, destroyed his wine, oil, and other stores, which were necessary 
<A NAME="705"></A>for the maintenance of his army; and abandoning the siege of Acilla, divided 
<A NAME="706"></A>his forces with Scipio, and retired through the kingdom of Juba, to 
<A NAME="707"></A>Adrumetum.
<A NAME="708"></A><BR><BR>Chapter 44
<A NAME="709"></A><BR><BR>Meanwhile one of the transports, belonging to the second embarkation, 
<A NAME="710"></A>which Allienus had sent from Sicily, in which were Q. Cominius, and L. 
<A NAME="711"></A>Ticida, a Roman knight, being separated from the rest of the fleet, in 
<A NAME="712"></A>a storm, and driven to Thapsus, was taken by Virgilius, and all the persons 
<A NAME="713"></A>on board sent to Scipio. A three-banked galley likewise, belonging to the 
<A NAME="714"></A>same fleet, being forced by the winds to Aegimurum, was intercepted by 
<A NAME="715"></A>the squadron under Varus and M. Octavius. In this vessel were some veteran 
<A NAME="716"></A>soldiers, with a centurion, and a few new levies, whom Varus treated without 
<A NAME="717"></A>insult, and sent under a guard to Scipio. When they came into his presence, 
<A NAME="718"></A>and appeared before his tribunal: "I am satisfied," said he, "it is not 
<A NAME="719"></A>by your own inclination, but at the instigation of your wicked general, 
<A NAME="720"></A>that you impiously wage war on your fellow-citizens, and every man of worth. 
<A NAME="721"></A>If, therefore, now that fortune has put you in our power, you will take 
<A NAME="722"></A>this opportunity to unite with the good citizens, in the defense of the 
<A NAME="723"></A>commonwealth, I am determined to give you life and money: therefore speak 
<A NAME="724"></A>openly your sentiments."
<A NAME="725"></A><BR><BR>Chapter 45
<A NAME="726"></A><BR><BR>Scipio having ended his speech, and expecting a thankful return 
<A NAME="727"></A>to so gracious an offer, permitted them to reply; one of their number, 
<A NAME="728"></A>a centurion of the fourteenth legion, thus addressed him: "Scipio," says 
<A NAME="729"></A>he ("for I can not give you the appellation of general), I return you my 
<A NAME="730"></A>hearty thanks for the good treatment you are willing to show to prisoners 
<A NAME="731"></A>of war; and perhaps I might accept of your kindness were it not to be purchased 
<A NAME="732"></A>at the expense of a horrible crime. What! shall I carry arms, and fight 
<A NAME="733"></A>against Caesar, my general, under whom I have served as centurion; and 
<A NAME="734"></A>against his victorious army, to whose renown I have for more than thirty-six 
<A NAME="735"></A>years endeavored to contribute by my valor? It is what I will never do, 
<A NAME="736"></A>and even advise you not to push the war any further. You know not what 
<A NAME="737"></A>troops you have to deal with, nor the difference betwixt them and yours: 
<A NAME="738"></A>of which, if you please, I will give you an indisputable instance. Do you 
<A NAME="739"></A>pick out the best cohort you have in your army, and give me only ten of 
<A NAME="740"></A>my comrades, who are now your prisoners, to engage them: you shall see 
<A NAME="741"></A>by the success, what you are to expect from your soldiers."
<A NAME="742"></A><BR><BR>Chapter 46
<A NAME="743"></A><BR><BR>When the centurion had courageously made this reply, Scipio, incensed 
<A NAME="744"></A>at his boldness, and resenting the affront, made a sign to some of his 
<A NAME="745"></A>officers to kill him on the spot, which was immediately put in execution. 
<A NAME="746"></A>At the same time, ordering the other veteran soldiers to be separated from 
<A NAME="747"></A>the new levies, "Carry away." said he, "these men, contaminated by the 
<A NAME="748"></A>pollution of crime, and pampered with the blood of their fellow-citizens." 
<A NAME="749"></A>Accordingly they were conducted without the rampart, and cruelly massacred. 
<A NAME="750"></A>The new-raised soldiers were distributed among his legions, and Cominius 
<A NAME="751"></A>and Ticida forbade to appear in his presence. Caesar, concerned for his 
<A NAME="752"></A>misfortune, broke, with ignominy, the officers whose instructions were 
<A NAME="753"></A>to secure the coast, and advance to a certain distance into the main sea, 
<A NAME="754"></A>to protect and facilitate the approach of the transports, but who had neglected 
<A NAME="755"></A>their duty on that important station.
<A NAME="756"></A><BR><BR>Chapter 47
<A NAME="757"></A><BR><BR>About this time a most incredible accident befell Caesar's army; 
<A NAME="758"></A>for the Pleiades being set, about the second watch of the night, a terrible 
<A NAME="759"></A>storm arose, attended by hail of an uncommon size. But what contributed 
<A NAME="760"></A>to render this misfortune the greater was, that Caesar had not, like other 
<A NAME="761"></A>generals, put his troops into winter quarters, but was every three or four 
<A NAME="762"></A>days changing his camp, to gain ground on the enemy; which keeping the 
<A NAME="763"></A>soldiers continually employed they were utterly unprovided with any conveniences 
<A NAME="764"></A>to protect them from the inclemency of the weather. Besides, he had brought 
<A NAME="765"></A>over his army from Sicily with such strictness, that neither officer nor 
<A NAME="766"></A>soldier had been permitted to take their equipages or utensils with them, 
<A NAME="767"></A>nor so much as a vessel or a single slave; and so far had they been from 
<A NAME="768"></A>acquiring or providing themselves with any thing in Africa, that, on account 
<A NAME="769"></A>of the great scarcity of provisions, they had even consumed their former 
<A NAME="770"></A>stores. Impoverished by these accidents, very few of them had tents; the 
<A NAME="771"></A>rest had made themselves a kind of covering, either by spreading their 
<A NAME="772"></A>clothes, or with mats and rushes. But these being soon penetrated by the 
<A NAME="773"></A>storm and hail, the soldiers had no resource left, but wandered up and 
<A NAME="774"></A>down the camp, covering their heads with their bucklers to shelter them 
<A NAME="775"></A>from the violence of the weather. In a short time the whole camp was under 
<A NAME="776"></A>water, the fires extinguished, and all their provisions washed away or 
<A NAME="777"></A>spoiled. The same night the shafts of the javelins belonging to the fifth 
<A NAME="778"></A>legion, of their own accord, took fire.
<A NAME="779"></A><BR><BR>Chapter 48
<A NAME="780"></A><BR><BR>In the mean time, king Juba, having been informed of the cavalry 
<A NAME="781"></A>actions with Scipio, and being earnestly solicited, by letters from that 
<A NAME="782"></A>general, to come to his assistance, left Sabura at home with part of the 
<A NAME="783"></A>army, to carry on the war against Sitius, and that he might add the weight 
<A NAME="784"></A>of his authority to free Scipio's troops from the dread they had of Caesar, 
<A NAME="785"></A>began his march, with three legions, eight hundred regular horse, a body 
<A NAME="786"></A>of Numidian cavalry, great numbers of light-armed infantry, and thirty 
<A NAME="787"></A>elephants. When he arrived he lodged himself, with those forces which I 
<A NAME="788"></A>have described, in a separate camp, at no great distance from that of Scipio. 
<A NAME="789"></A>(Great alarm had prevailed for some time previously in Caesar's camp, and 
<A NAME="790"></A>the report of his approach had increased and produced a general suspense 
<A NAME="791"></A>and expectation among the troops. But his arrival, and the appearance of 
<A NAME="792"></A>his camp, soon dispelled all these apprehensions; and they despised the 
<A NAME="793"></A>king of Mauritania, now that he was present, as much as they had feared 
<A NAME="794"></A>him when at a distance.) After this junction, any one might easily perceive 
<A NAME="795"></A>that Scipio's courage and confidence were increased by the arrival of the 
<A NAME="796"></A>king. For next day, drawing out all his own and the royal forces, with 
<A NAME="797"></A>sixty elephants, he ranged them, in order of battle, with great ostentation 
<A NAME="798"></A>advancing a little beyond his intrenchments, and, after a short stay, retreated 
<A NAME="799"></A>to his camp.
<A NAME="800"></A><BR><BR>Chapter 49
<A NAME="801"></A><BR><BR>Caesar, knowing that Scipio had received all the supplies he expected, 
<A NAME="802"></A>and judging he would no longer decline coming to an engagement, began to 
<A NAME="803"></A>advance along the ridge with his forces, extend his lines, secure them 
<A NAME="804"></A>with redoubts, and possess himself of the eminences between him and Scipio. 
<A NAME="805"></A>The enemy, confiding in their numbers, seized a neighboring hill, and thereby 
<A NAME="806"></A>prevented the progress of our works. Labienus had formed the design of 
<A NAME="807"></A>securing this post, and as it lay nearest his quarters, soon got 
<A NAME="808"></A>thither.
<A NAME="809"></A><BR><BR>Chapter 50
<A NAME="810"></A><BR><BR>There was a broad and deep valley, of rugged descent, broken with 
<A NAME="811"></A>caves, which Caesar had to pass before he could come to the hill which 
<A NAME="812"></A>he wished to occupy, and beyond which was a thick grove of old olives. 
<A NAME="813"></A>Labienus, perceiving that Caesar must march this way, and having a perfect 
<A NAME="814"></A>knowledge of the country, placed himself in ambush, with the light-armed 
<A NAME="815"></A>foot and part of the cavalry. At the same time he disposed some horse behind 
<A NAME="816"></A>the hills, that when he should fall unexpectedly upon Caesar's foot, they 
<A NAME="817"></A>might suddenly advance from behind the mountain. And thus Caesar and his 
<A NAME="818"></A>army being attacked in front and rear, surrounded with danger on all sides, 
<A NAME="819"></A>and unable either to retreat or advance, would, he imagined, fall an easy 
<A NAME="820"></A>prey to his victorious troops. Caesar, who had no suspicion of the ambuscade, 
<A NAME="821"></A>sent his cavalry before; and arriving at the place, Labienus's men, either 
<A NAME="822"></A>forgetting or neglecting the orders of their general, or fearing to be 
<A NAME="823"></A>trampled to death in the ditch by our cavalry, began to issue in small 
<A NAME="824"></A>parties from the rock, and ascend the hill. Caesar's horse pursuing them, 
<A NAME="825"></A>slew some, and took others prisoners; then making toward the hill drove 
<A NAME="826"></A>thence Labienus's detachment and immediately took possession. Labienus, 
<A NAME="827"></A>with a small party of horse, escaped with great difficulty by 
<A NAME="828"></A>flight.
<A NAME="829"></A><BR><BR>Chapter 51
<A NAME="830"></A><BR><BR>The cavalry having thus cleared the mountain, Caesar resolved to 
<A NAME="831"></A>intrench himself there, and distributed the work to the legions. He then 
<A NAME="832"></A>ordered two lines of communication to be drawn from the greater camp, across 
<A NAME="833"></A>the plain on the side of Uzita, which stood between him and the enemy, 
<A NAME="834"></A>and was garrisoned by a detachment of Scipio's army, and place them in 
<A NAME="835"></A>such a manner as to meet at the right and left angles of the town. His 
<A NAME="836"></A>design in this work was, that when he approached the town with his troops, 
<A NAME="837"></A>and began to attack it, these lines might secure his flanks, and hinder 
<A NAME="838"></A>the enemy's horse from surrounding him, and compelling him to abandon the 
<A NAME="839"></A>siege. It likewise gave his men more frequent opportunities of conversing 
<A NAME="840"></A>with the enemy, and facilitated the means of desertion to such as favored 
<A NAME="841"></A>his cause; many of whom had already come over, though not without great 
<A NAME="842"></A>danger to themselves. He wanted also, by drawing nearer the enemy, to see 
<A NAME="843"></A>if they really intended to come to an action, and in addition to all these 
<A NAME="844"></A>reasons, that the place itself being very low, he might there sink some 
<A NAME="845"></A>wells; whereas before he had a long and troublesome way to send for water. 
<A NAME="846"></A>While the legions were employed in these works, part of the army stood 
<A NAME="847"></A>ready drawn up before the trenches, and had frequent skirmishes with the 
<A NAME="848"></A>Numidian horse and light-armed foot
<A NAME="849"></A><BR><BR>Chapter 52
<A NAME="850"></A><BR><BR>A little before evening, when Caesar was drawing off his legions 
<A NAME="851"></A>from the works, Juba, Scipio, and Labienus, at the head of all their horse 
<A NAME="852"></A>and light-armed foot, fell furiously upon his cavalry; who, being overwhelmed 
<A NAME="853"></A>by the sudden and general attack of so great a multitude, were forced to 
<A NAME="854"></A>give ground a little. But the event was very different from what the enemy 
<A NAME="855"></A>expected; for Caesar, leading back his legions to the assistance of his 
<A NAME="856"></A>cavalry, they immediately rallied, turned upon the Numidians, and charging 
<A NAME="857"></A>them vigorously while they were dispersed and disordered with the pursuit, 
<A NAME="858"></A>drove them with great loss to the king's camp, and slew several of them. 
<A NAME="859"></A>And had not night intervened, and the dust raised by the wind obstructed 
<A NAME="860"></A>the prospect, Juba and Labienus would both have fallen into Caesar's hands, 
<A NAME="861"></A>and their whole cavalry and light-armed infantry have been cut off. Meanwhile 
<A NAME="862"></A>Scipio's men, of the fourth and sixth legions, left him in crowds, some 
<A NAME="863"></A>deserting to Caesar's camp, others fleeing to such places as were most 
<A NAME="864"></A>convenient for them. Curio's horse likewise, distrusting Scipio and his 
<A NAME="865"></A>troops, followed the same counsel.
<A NAME="866"></A><BR><BR>Chapter 53
<A NAME="867"></A><BR><BR>While these things were being carried on by Caesar and his opponents 
<A NAME="868"></A>around Uzita, two legions, the ninth and tenth, sailing in transports from 
<A NAME="869"></A>Sicily, when they came before Ruspina, observing Caesar's ships that lay 
<A NAME="870"></A>at anchor about Thapsus, and fearing it might be the enemy's fleet stationed 
<A NAME="871"></A>there to intercept them, imprudently stood out to sea; and after being 
<A NAME="872"></A>long tossed by the winds, and harassed by thirst and famine, at last arrived 
<A NAME="873"></A>at Caesar's camp.
<A NAME="874"></A><BR><BR>Chapter 54
<A NAME="875"></A><BR><BR>Soon after these legions were landed, Caesar, calling to mind their 
<A NAME="876"></A>former licentious behaviour in Italy, and the rapines of some of their 
<A NAME="877"></A>officers, seized the slight pretext furnished by C. Avienus, a military 
<A NAME="878"></A>tribune of the tenth legion, who, when he set out for Sicily, filled a 
<A NAME="879"></A>ship entirely with his own slaves and horses, without taking on board one 
<A NAME="880"></A>single soldier. Wherefore, summoning all the military tribunes and centurions 
<A NAME="881"></A>to appear before his tribunal next day, he addressed them in these terms, 
<A NAME="882"></A>"I could have wished that those, whose insolence and former licentious 
<A NAME="883"></A>character have given me cause of complaint, had been capable of amendment, 
<A NAME="884"></A>and of making a good use of my mildness, patience, and moderation. But 
<A NAME="885"></A>since they know not how to confine themselves within due bounds, I intend 
<A NAME="886"></A>to make an example of them, according to the law of arms, in order that 
<A NAME="887"></A>others may be taught a better conduct. Because you, C. Avienus, when you 
<A NAME="888"></A>were in Italy, instigated the soldiers of the Roman people to revolt from 
<A NAME="889"></A>the republic and have been guilty of rapines and plunders in the municipal 
<A NAME="890"></A>towns; and because you have never been of any real service, either to the 
<A NAME="891"></A>commonwealth or to your general, and in lieu of soldiers, have crowded 
<A NAME="892"></A>the transports with your slaves and equipage; so that, through your fault, 
<A NAME="893"></A>the republic is in want of soldiers, who at this time are not only useful, 
<A NAME="894"></A>but necessary; for all these causes, I break you with ignominy, and order 
<A NAME="895"></A>you to leave Africa this very day. In like manner I break you, A. Fonteius, 
<A NAME="896"></A>because you have behaved yourself as a seditious officer, and as a bad 
<A NAME="897"></A>citizen. You, T. Salienus, M. Tiro, C. Clusinus, have attained the rank 
<A NAME="898"></A>of centurions through my indulgence, and not through your own merit; and 
<A NAME="899"></A>since you have been invested with that rank, have neither shown bravery 
<A NAME="900"></A>in war, nor good conduct in peace, and have been more zealous in raising 
<A NAME="901"></A>seditions, and exciting the soldiers against your general than in observing 
<A NAME="902"></A>forbearance and moderation. I therefore think you unworthy of continuing 
<A NAME="903"></A>centurions in my army: I break you, and order you to quit Africa as soon 
<A NAME="904"></A>as possible." Having concluded this speech, he delivered them over to some 
<A NAME="905"></A>centurions, with orders to confine them separately on board a ship, allowing 
<A NAME="906"></A>each of them a single slave to wait on him.
<A NAME="907"></A><BR><BR>Chapter 55
<A NAME="908"></A><BR><BR>Meantime the Getulian deserters, whom Caesar had sent home with 
<A NAME="909"></A>letters and instructions, as we related above, arrived among their countrymen: 
<A NAME="910"></A>who, partly swayed by their authority, partly by the name and reputation 
<A NAME="911"></A>of Caesar, revolted from Juba; and speedily and unanimously taking up arms, 
<A NAME="912"></A>scrupled not to act in opposition to their king. Juba, having thus three 
<A NAME="913"></A>wars to sustain, was compelled to detach six cohorts from the army destined 
<A NAME="914"></A>to act against Caesar, and send them to defend the frontiers of his kingdom 
<A NAME="915"></A>against the Getulians.
<A NAME="916"></A><BR><BR>Chapter 56
<A NAME="917"></A><BR><BR>Caesar, having finished his lines of communication, and pushed 
<A NAME="918"></A>them so near the town, as to be just out of reach of dart, intrenched himself 
<A NAME="919"></A>there. He caused warlike engines in great numbers to be placed in the front 
<A NAME="920"></A>of his works, wherewith he played perpetually against the town; and to 
<A NAME="921"></A>increase the enemy's apprehensions, drew five legions out of his other 
<A NAME="922"></A>camp. When this opportunity was presented, several persons of eminence 
<A NAME="923"></A>and distinction earnestly requested an interview with their friends, and 
<A NAME="924"></A>held frequent conferences, which Caesar foresaw would turn to his advantage. 
<A NAME="925"></A>For the chief officers of the Getulian horse, with other illustrious men 
<A NAME="926"></A>of that nation (whose fathers had served under C. Marius, and from his 
<A NAME="927"></A>bounty obtained considerable estates in their country, but after Sylla's 
<A NAME="928"></A>victory had been made tributaries to king Hiempsal), taking advantage of 
<A NAME="929"></A>the night, when the fires were lighted, came over to Caesar's camp near 
<A NAME="930"></A>Uzita, with their horses and servants, to the number of about a 
<A NAME="931"></A>thousand.
<A NAME="932"></A><BR><BR>Chapter 57
<A NAME="933"></A><BR><BR>When Scipio and his party learned this, and were much annoyed at 
<A NAME="934"></A>the disaster, they perceived, much about the same time, M. Aquinius in 
<A NAME="935"></A>discourse with C. Saserna. Scipio sent him word that he did not do well 
<A NAME="936"></A>to correspond with the enemy. Aquinius, however, paid no attention to this 
<A NAME="937"></A>reprimand, but pursued his discourse. Soon after, one of Juba's guards 
<A NAME="938"></A>came to him and told him, in the hearing of Saserna, "The king forbids 
<A NAME="939"></A>you to continue this conversation." He, being terrified by this order, 
<A NAME="940"></A>immediately retired, and obeyed the command of the king. One can not wonder 
<A NAME="941"></A>enough at this step in a Roman citizen, who had already attained to considerable 
<A NAME="942"></A>honors in the commonwealth; that though neither banished his country, nor 
<A NAME="943"></A>stripped of his possessions, he should pay a more ready obedience to the 
<A NAME="944"></A>orders of a foreign prince than those of Scipio; and choose rather to behold 
<A NAME="945"></A>the destruction of his party than return into the bosom of his country. 
<A NAME="946"></A>And still greater insolence was shown by Juba, not to M. Aquinius, a man 
<A NAME="947"></A>of no family, and an inconsiderable senator, but even to Scipio himself, 
<A NAME="948"></A>a man of illustrious birth, distinguished honors, and high dignity in the 
<A NAME="949"></A>state. For as Scipio, before the king's arrival, always wore a purple coat 
<A NAME="950"></A>of mail, Juba is reported to have told him, that he ought not to wear the 
<A NAME="951"></A>same habit as he did. Accordingly, Scipio changed his purple robe for a 
<A NAME="952"></A>white one, submitting to Juba, a most haughty and insolent 
<A NAME="953"></A>monarch.
<A NAME="954"></A><BR><BR>Chapter 58
<A NAME="955"></A><BR><BR>Next day they drew out all their forces from both camps; and forming 
<A NAME="956"></A>them on an eminence not far from Caesar's camp, continued thus in order 
<A NAME="957"></A>of battle. Caesar likewise drew out his men, and disposed them in battle 
<A NAME="958"></A>array before his lines; not doubting but the enemy, who exceeded him in 
<A NAME="959"></A>number of troops, and had been so considerably reinforced by the arrival 
<A NAME="960"></A>of king Juba, would advance to attack him. Wherefore, having ridden through 
<A NAME="961"></A>the ranks, encouraged his men, and gave them the signal of battle, he stayed, 
<A NAME="962"></A>expecting the enemy's charge. For he did not think it advisable to remove 
<A NAME="963"></A>far from his lines: because the enemy having a strong garrison in Uzita, 
<A NAME="964"></A>which was opposite to his right wing, he could not advance beyond that 
<A NAME="965"></A>place without exposing his flank to a sally from the town. He was also 
<A NAME="966"></A>deterred by the following reason, because the ground before Scipio's army 
<A NAME="967"></A>was very rough, and he thought it likely to disorder his men in the 
<A NAME="968"></A>charge.
<A NAME="969"></A><BR><BR>Chapter 59
<A NAME="970"></A><BR><BR>And I think that I ought not to omit to describe the order of battle 
<A NAME="971"></A>of both armies. Scipio drew up his troops in the following manner: he posted 
<A NAME="972"></A>his own legions and those of Juba in the front; behind them the Numidians, 
<A NAME="973"></A>as a body of reserve: but in so very thin ranks, and so far extended in 
<A NAME="974"></A>length, that to see them at a distance you would have taken the main body 
<A NAME="975"></A>for a simple line of legionaries, which was doubled only upon the wings. 
<A NAME="976"></A>He placed elephants at equal distances on the right and left, and supported 
<A NAME="977"></A>them by the light-armed troops and auxiliary Numidians. All the regular 
<A NAME="978"></A>cavalry were on the right; for the left was covered by the town of Uzita, 
<A NAME="979"></A>nor had the cavalry room to extend themselves on that side. Accordingly, 
<A NAME="980"></A>he stationed the Numidian horse, with an incredible multitude of light-armed 
<A NAME="981"></A>foot, about a thousand paces from his right, toward the foot of a mountain, 
<A NAME="982"></A>considerably removed from his own and the enemy's troops. He did so with 
<A NAME="983"></A>this intention, that, when the two armies should engage, his cavalry at 
<A NAME="984"></A>the commencement of the action should take a longer sweep, inclose Caesar's 
<A NAME="985"></A>army and throw them into confusion by their darts. Such was Scipio's 
<A NAME="986"></A>disposition.
<A NAME="987"></A><BR><BR>Chapter 60
<A NAME="988"></A><BR><BR>Caesar's order of battle, to describe it from left to right, was 
<A NAME="989"></A>arranged in the following manner: the ninth and eighth legions formed the 
<A NAME="990"></A>left wing: the thirteenth, fourteenth, twenty-eighth, and twenty-sixth, 
<A NAME="991"></A>the main body; and the thirtieth and twenty-eighth the right. His second 
<A NAME="992"></A>line on the right consisted partly of the cohorts of those legions we have 
<A NAME="993"></A>already mentioned, partly of the new levies. His third line was posted 
<A NAME="994"></A>to the left, extending as far as the middle legion of the main body, and 
<A NAME="995"></A>so disposed, that the left wing formed a triple order of battle. The reason 
<A NAME="996"></A>of this disposition was, because his right wing being defended by the works, 
<A NAME="997"></A>it behooved him to make his left stronger, that they might be a match for 
<A NAME="998"></A>the numerous cavalry of the enemy; for which reason he had placed all his 
<A NAME="999"></A>horse there, intermixed with light-armed foot; and as he could not rely 
<A NAME="1000"></A>much upon them, had detached the fifth legion to sustain them. He placed 
<A NAME="1001"></A>archers up and down the field, but principally in the two 
<A NAME="1002"></A>wings.
<A NAME="1003"></A><BR><BR>Chapter 61
<A NAME="1004"></A><BR><BR>The two armies thus facing one another in order of battle, with 
<A NAME="1005"></A>a space of no more than three hundred paces between, continued so posted 
<A NAME="1006"></A>from morning till night without fighting, of which perhaps there was never 
<A NAME="1007"></A>an instance before. But when Caesar began to retreat within his lines, 
<A NAME="1008"></A>suddenly all the Numidian and Getulian horse without bridles, who were 
<A NAME="1009"></A>posted behind the enemy's army, made a motion to the right, and began to 
<A NAME="1010"></A>approach Caesar's camp on the mountain; while the regular cavalry under 
<A NAME="1011"></A>Labienus continued in their post to keep our legions in check. Upon this, 
<A NAME="1012"></A>part of Caesar's cavalry, with the light-armed foot, advancing hastily, 
<A NAME="1013"></A>and without orders, against the Getulians, and venturing to pass the morass, 
<A NAME="1014"></A>found themselves unable to deal with the superior multitude of the enemy; 
<A NAME="1015"></A>and being abandoned by the light-armed troops, were forced to retreat in 
<A NAME="1016"></A>great disorder, after the loss of one trooper, twenty-six light-armed foot, 
<A NAME="1017"></A>and many of their horses wounded. Scipio, overjoyed at this success, returned 
<A NAME="1018"></A>toward night to his camp. But fortune determined not to give such unalloyed 
<A NAME="1019"></A>joy to those engaged in war, for the day after, a party of horse, sent 
<A NAME="1020"></A>by Caesar to Leptis in quest of provisions, falling in unexpectedly with 
<A NAME="1021"></A>some Numidian and Getulian stragglers, killed or made prisoners about a 
<A NAME="1022"></A>hundred of them. Caesar, meanwhile, omitted not every day to draw out his 
<A NAME="1023"></A>men and labor at the works; carrying a ditch and rampart quite across the 
<A NAME="1024"></A>plain, to prevent the incursions of the enemy. Scipio likewise drew lines 
<A NAME="1025"></A>opposite to Caesar's, and used great exertions lest Caesar should cut off 
<A NAME="1026"></A>his communication with the mountain. Thus both generals were busied about 
<A NAME="1027"></A>their intrenchments, yet a day seldom passed, without some skirmish between 
<A NAME="1028"></A>the cavalry.
<A NAME="1029"></A><BR><BR>Chapter 62
<A NAME="1030"></A><BR><BR>In the mean time, Varus, upon notice that the seventh and eighth 
<A NAME="1031"></A>legions had sailed from Sicily, speedily equipped the fleet he had brought 
<A NAME="1032"></A>to winter at Utica; and manning it with Getulian rowers and mariners, went 
<A NAME="1033"></A>out a cruising and came before Adrumetum with fifty-five ships. Caesar, 
<A NAME="1034"></A>ignorant of his arrival, sent L. Cispius, with a squadron of twenty-seven 
<A NAME="1035"></A>sail toward Thapsus, to anchor there for the security of his convoys; and 
<A NAME="1036"></A>likewise dispatched Q. Aquila to Adrumetum, with thirteen galleys, upon 
<A NAME="1037"></A>the same errand. Cispius soon reached the station appointed to him: but 
<A NAME="1038"></A>Aquila being attacked by a storm could not double the cape, which obliged 
<A NAME="1039"></A>him to put into a creek at some distance, that afforded convenient shelter. 
<A NAME="1040"></A>The rest of the fleet which remained at sea before Leptis, where the mariners 
<A NAME="1041"></A>having landed and wandered here and there upon the shore, some having gone 
<A NAME="1042"></A>into the town for the purpose of purchasing provisions, was left quite 
<A NAME="1043"></A>defenseless. Varus, having notice of this from a deserter, and resolving 
<A NAME="1044"></A>to take advantage of the enemy's negligence, left Adrumetum in Cothon at 
<A NAME="1045"></A>the commencement of the second watch, and arriving early next morning with 
<A NAME="1046"></A>his whole fleet before Leptis, burned all the transports that were out 
<A NAME="1047"></A>at sea, and took without opposition two five-benched galleys, in which 
<A NAME="1048"></A>were none to defend them.
<A NAME="1049"></A><BR><BR>Chapter 63
<A NAME="1050"></A><BR><BR>Caesar had an account brought him of this unlucky accident, as 
<A NAME="1051"></A>he was inspecting the works of his camp. Whereupon he immediately took 
<A NAME="1052"></A>horse, and leaving every thing else, went full speed to Leptis, which was 
<A NAME="1053"></A>but two leagues distant, and going on board a brigantine, ordered all the 
<A NAME="1054"></A>ships to follow him. He soon came up with Aquila, whom he found dismayed 
<A NAME="1055"></A>and terrified at the number of ships he had to oppose; and continuing his 
<A NAME="1056"></A>course, began to pursue the enemy's fleet. Meantime Varus, astonished at 
<A NAME="1057"></A>Caesar's boldness and dispatch, tacked about with his whole fleet, and 
<A NAME="1058"></A>made the best of his way for Adrumetum. But Caesar, after four miles' sail, 
<A NAME="1059"></A>recovered one of his galleys, with the crew and a hundred and thirty of 
<A NAME="1060"></A>the enemy's men left to guard her; and took a three benched galley belonging 
<A NAME="1061"></A>to the enemy which had fallen astern during the engagement, with all the 
<A NAME="1062"></A>soldiers and mariners on board. The rest of the fleet doubled the cape, 
<A NAME="1063"></A>and made the port of Adrumetum in Cothon. Caesar could not double the cape 
<A NAME="1064"></A>with the same wind, but keeping the sea at anchor all night, appeared early 
<A NAME="1065"></A>next morning before Adrumetum. He set fire to all the transports without 
<A NAME="1066"></A>Cothon, and took what galleys he found there, or forced them into the harbor; 
<A NAME="1067"></A>and having waited some time to offer the enemy battle, returned again to 
<A NAME="1068"></A>his camp.
<A NAME="1069"></A><BR><BR>Chapter 64
<A NAME="1070"></A><BR><BR>On board the ship he had taken was P. Vestrius, a Roman knight, 
<A NAME="1071"></A>and P. Ligarius, who had served in Spain under Afranius, the same who had 
<A NAME="1072"></A>prosecuted the war against him in Spain, and who, instead of acknowledging 
<A NAME="1073"></A>the conqueror's generosity, in granting him his liberty, had joined Pompey 
<A NAME="1074"></A>in Greece; and after the battle of Pharsalia, had gone into Africa, to 
<A NAME="1075"></A>Varus, there to continue in the service of the same cause. Caesar, to punish 
<A NAME="1076"></A>his perfidy and breach of oath, gave immediate orders for his execution. 
<A NAME="1077"></A>But he pardoned P. Vestrius, because his brother had paid his ransom at 
<A NAME="1078"></A>Rome, and because he himself proved, that being taken in Nasidius's fleet, 
<A NAME="1079"></A>and condemned to die, he had been saved by the kindness of Varus, since 
<A NAME="1080"></A>which no opportunity had offered of making his escape.
<A NAME="1081"></A><BR><BR>Chapter 65
<A NAME="1082"></A><BR><BR>It is the custom of the people of Africa to deposit their corn 
<A NAME="1083"></A>privately in vaults, under ground, to secure it in time of war, and guard 
<A NAME="1084"></A>it from the sudden incursions of an enemy. Caesar, having intelligence 
<A NAME="1085"></A>of this from a spy, drew out two legions, with a party of cavalry, at midnight, 
<A NAME="1086"></A>and sent them about ten miles off; whence they returned, loaded with corn 
<A NAME="1087"></A>to the camp. Labienus, being informed of it, marched about seven miles, 
<A NAME="1088"></A>through the mountains Caesar had passed the day before, and there encamped 
<A NAME="1089"></A>with two legions; where expecting that Caesar would often come the same 
<A NAME="1090"></A>way in quest of corn, he daily lay in ambush with a great body of horse 
<A NAME="1091"></A>and light-armed foot.
<A NAME="1092"></A><BR><BR>Chapter 66
<A NAME="1093"></A><BR><BR>Caesar, being informed of the ambuscade of Labienus by deserters, 
<A NAME="1094"></A>delayed there a few days, till the enemy, by repeating the practice often, 
<A NAME="1095"></A>had abated a little of their circumspection. Then suddenly, one morning 
<A NAME="1096"></A>ordering eight veteran legions with part of the cavalry to follow him by 
<A NAME="1097"></A>the Decuman gate, he sent forward the rest of the cavalry; who, coming 
<A NAME="1098"></A>suddenly upon the enemy's light-armed foot, that lay in ambush among the 
<A NAME="1099"></A>valleys, slew about five hundred, and put the rest to flight. Meantime 
<A NAME="1100"></A>Labienus advanced, with all his cavalry, to support the fugitives, and 
<A NAME="1101"></A>was on the point of overpowering our small party with his numbers, when 
<A NAME="1102"></A>suddenly Caesar appeared with the legions, in order of battle. This sight 
<A NAME="1103"></A>checked the ardor of Labienus, who thought proper to sound a retreat. The 
<A NAME="1104"></A>day after, Juba ordered all the Numidians who had deserted their post and 
<A NAME="1105"></A>fled to their camp to be crucified.
<A NAME="1106"></A><BR><BR>Chapter 67
<A NAME="1107"></A><BR><BR>Meanwhile Caesar, being distressed by want of corn, recalled all 
<A NAME="1108"></A>his forces to the camp; and having left garrisons at Leptis, Ruspina, and 
<A NAME="1109"></A>Acilla, ordered Cispius and Aquila to blockade with their fleets, the one 
<A NAME="1110"></A>Adrumetum, the other Thapsus, and setting fire to his camp at Uzita, he 
<A NAME="1111"></A>set out, in order of battle, at the fourth watch, disposed his baggage 
<A NAME="1112"></A>on the left, and came to Agar, which had been often vigorously attacked 
<A NAME="1113"></A>by the Getulians, and as valiantly defended by the inhabitants. There encamping 
<A NAME="1114"></A>in the plain before the town, he went with part of his army round the country 
<A NAME="1115"></A>in quest of provisions; and having found a large store of barley, oil, 
<A NAME="1116"></A>wine, and figs, with a small quantity of wheat, after allowing the troops 
<A NAME="1117"></A>some time to refresh themselves, he returned to his camp. Scipio meanwhile 
<A NAME="1118"></A>hearing of Caesar's departure, followed him along the hills, with all his 
<A NAME="1119"></A>forces, and posted himself about six miles off; in three different 
<A NAME="1120"></A>camps.
<A NAME="1121"></A><BR><BR>Chapter 68
<A NAME="1122"></A><BR><BR>The town of Zeta, lying on Scipio's side of the country, was not 
<A NAME="1123"></A>above ten miles from his camp, but might be about eighteen from that of 
<A NAME="1124"></A>Caesar. Scipio had sent two legions thither to forage; which Caesar having 
<A NAME="1125"></A>intelligence of from a deserter, removed his camp from the plain to a hill,
