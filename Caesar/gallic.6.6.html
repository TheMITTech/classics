<A NAME="start"></A>
<A NAME="10"></A><B>Chapter 1</B>
<A NAME="11"></A><BR><BR>Caesar, expecting for many reasons a greater commotion in Gaul, 
<A NAME="12"></A>resolves to hold a levy by the means of M. Silanus C. Antistius Reginus, 
<A NAME="13"></A>and T. Sextius, his lieutenants: at the same time he requested Cn. Pompey, 
<A NAME="14"></A>the proconsul, that since he was remaining near the city invested with 
<A NAME="15"></A>military command for the interests of the commonwealth, he would command 
<A NAME="16"></A>those men whom when consul he had levied by the military oath in Cisalpine 
<A NAME="17"></A>Gaul, to join their respective corps, and to proceed to him; thinking it 
<A NAME="18"></A>of great importance, as far as regarded the opinion which the Gauls would 
<A NAME="19"></A>entertain for the future, that that the resources of Italy should appear 
<A NAME="20"></A>so great that if any loss should be sustained in war, not only could it 
<A NAME="21"></A>be repaired in a short time, but likewise be further supplied by still 
<A NAME="22"></A>larger forces. And when Pompey had granted this to the interests of the 
<A NAME="23"></A>commonwealth and the claims of friendship, Caesar having quickly completed 
<A NAME="24"></A>the levy by means of his lieutenants, after three regiments had been both 
<A NAME="25"></A>formed and brought to him before the winter [had] expired, and the number 
<A NAME="26"></A>of those cohorts which he had lost under Q. Titurius had been doubled, 
<A NAME="27"></A>taught the Gauls, both by his dispatch and by his forces what the discipline 
<A NAME="28"></A>and the power of the Roman people could accomplish.
<A NAME="29"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 2</B>
<A NAME="30"></A><BR><BR>Indutiomarus having been slain, as we have stated, the government 
<A NAME="31"></A>was conferred upon his relatives by the Treviri. They cease not to importune 
<A NAME="32"></A>the neighboring Germans and to promise them money: when they could not 
<A NAME="33"></A>obtain [their object] from those nearest them, they try those more remote. 
<A NAME="34"></A>Having found some states willing to accede to their wishes, they enter 
<A NAME="35"></A>into a compact with them by a mutual oath, and give hostages as a security 
<A NAME="36"></A>for the money: they attach Ambiorix to them by an alliance and confederacy. 
<A NAME="37"></A>Caesar, on being informed of their acts, since he saw that war was being 
<A NAME="38"></A>prepared on all sides, that the Nervii, Aduatuci, and Menapii, with the 
<A NAME="39"></A>addition of all the Germans on this side of the Rhine were under arms, 
<A NAME="40"></A>that the Senones did not assemble according to his command, and were concerting 
<A NAME="41"></A>measures with the Carnutes and the neighboring states, that the Germans 
<A NAME="42"></A>were importuned by the Treviri in frequent embassies, thought that he ought 
<A NAME="43"></A>to take measures for the war earlier [than usual].
<A NAME="44"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 3</B>
<A NAME="45"></A><BR><BR>Accordingly, while the winter was not yet ended, having concentrated 
<A NAME="46"></A>the four nearest legions, he marched unexpectedly into the territories 
<A NAME="47"></A>of the Nervii, and before they could either assemble or retreat, after 
<A NAME="48"></A>capturing a large number of cattle and of men, and wasting their lands 
<A NAME="49"></A>and giving up that booty to the soldiers, compelled them to enter into 
<A NAME="50"></A>a surrender and give him hostages. That business having been speedily executed, 
<A NAME="51"></A>he again led his legions back into winter-quarters. Having proclaimed a 
<A NAME="52"></A>council of Gaul in the beginning of the spring, as he had been accustomed 
<A NAME="53"></A>[to do], when the deputies from the rest, except the Senones, the Carnutes, 
<A NAME="54"></A>and the Treviri, had come, judging this to be the commencement of war and 
<A NAME="55"></A>revolt, that he might appear to consider all things of less consequence 
<A NAME="56"></A>[than that war], he transfers the council to Lutetia of the Parisii. These 
<A NAME="57"></A>were adjacent to the Senones, and had united their state to them during 
<A NAME="58"></A>the memory of their fathers, but were thought to have no part in the present 
<A NAME="59"></A>plot. Having proclaimed this from the tribunal, he advances the same day 
<A NAME="60"></A>toward the Senones with his legions, and arrives among them by long 
<A NAME="61"></A>marches.
<A NAME="62"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 4</B>
<A NAME="63"></A><BR><BR>Acco, who had been the author of that enterprise, on being informed 
<A NAME="64"></A>of his arrival, orders the people to assemble in the towns; to them, while 
<A NAME="65"></A>attempting this, and before it could be accomplished, news is brought that 
<A NAME="66"></A>the Romans are close at hand: through necessity they give over their design 
<A NAME="67"></A>and send embassadors to Caesar for the purpose of imploring pardon; they 
<A NAME="68"></A>make advances to him through the Aedui, whose state was from ancient times 
<A NAME="69"></A>under the protection of Rome. Caesar readily grants them pardon, and receives 
<A NAME="70"></A>their excuse, at the request of the Aedui, because he thought that the 
<A NAME="71"></A>summer season was one for an impending war, not for an investigation. Having 
<A NAME="72"></A>imposed one hundred hostages, he delivers these to the Aedui to be held 
<A NAME="73"></A>in charge by them. To the same place the Carnutes send embassadors and 
<A NAME="74"></A>hostages, employing as their mediators the Remi, under whose protection 
<A NAME="75"></A>they were: they receive the same answers. Caesar concludes the council 
<A NAME="76"></A>and imposes a levy of cavalry on the states.
<A NAME="77"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 5</B>
<A NAME="78"></A><BR><BR>This part of Gaul having been tranquilized, he applies himself 
<A NAME="79"></A>entirely both in mind and soul to the war with the Treviri and Ambiorix. 
<A NAME="80"></A>He orders Cavarinus to march with him with the cavalry of the Senones, 
<A NAME="81"></A>lest any commotion should arise either out of his hot temper, or out of 
<A NAME="82"></A>the hatred of the state which he had incurred. After arranging these things, 
<A NAME="83"></A>as he considered it certain that Ambiorix would not contend in battle, 
<A NAME="84"></A>he watched his other plans attentively. The Menapii bordered on the territories 
<A NAME="85"></A>of the Eburones, and were protected by one continued extent of morasses 
<A NAME="86"></A>and woods; and they alone out of Gaul had never sent embassadors to Caesar 
<A NAME="87"></A>on the subject of peace. Caesar knew that a tie of hospitality subsisted 
<A NAME="88"></A>between them and Ambiorix: he also discovered that the latter had entered 
<A NAME="89"></A>into an alliance with the Germans by means of the Treviri. Ho thought that 
<A NAME="90"></A>these auxiliaries ought to be detached from him before he provoked him 
<A NAME="91"></A>to war; lest he, despairing of safety, should either proceed to conceal 
<A NAME="92"></A>himself in the territories of the Menapii, or should be driven to coalesce 
<A NAME="93"></A>with the Germans beyond the Rhine. Having entered upon this resolution, 
<A NAME="94"></A>he sends the baggage of the whole army to Labienus, in the territories 
<A NAME="95"></A>of the Treviri and orders two legions to proceed to him: he himself proceeds 
<A NAME="96"></A>against the Menapii with five lightly-equipped legions. They, having assembled 
<A NAME="97"></A>no troops, as they relied on the defense of their position, retreat into 
<A NAME="98"></A>the woods and morasses, and convey thither all their 
<A NAME="99"></A>property.
<A NAME="100"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 6</B>
<A NAME="101"></A><BR><BR>Caesar, having divided his forces with C. Fabius, his lieutenant, 
<A NAME="102"></A>and M. Crassus his questor, and having hastily constructed some bridges, 
<A NAME="103"></A>enters their country in three divisions, burns their houses and villages, 
<A NAME="104"></A>and gets possession of a large number of cattle and men. Constrained by 
<A NAME="105"></A>these circumstances the Menapii send embassadors to him for the purpose 
<A NAME="106"></A>of suing for peace. He, after receiving hostages, assures them that he 
<A NAME="107"></A>will consider them in the number of his enemies if they shall receive within 
<A NAME="108"></A>their territories either Ambiorix or his embassadors. Having determinately 
<A NAME="109"></A>settled these things, he left among the Menapii, Commius the Atrebatian, 
<A NAME="110"></A>with some cavalry as a guard; he himself proceeds toward the 
<A NAME="111"></A>Treviri.
<A NAME="112"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 7</B>
<A NAME="113"></A><BR><BR>While these things are being performed by Caesar, the Treviri, 
<A NAME="114"></A>having drawn together large forces of infantry and cavalry, were preparing 
<A NAME="115"></A>to attack Labienus and the legion which was wintering in their territories, 
<A NAME="116"></A>and were already not further distant from him than a journey of two days, 
<A NAME="117"></A>when they learn that two legions had arrived by the order of Caesar. Having 
<A NAME="118"></A>pitched their camp fifteen miles off, they resolve to await the support 
<A NAME="119"></A>of the Germans. Labienus, having learned the design of the enemy, hoping 
<A NAME="120"></A>that through their rashness there would be some opportunity of engaging, 
<A NAME="121"></A>after leaving a guard of five cohorts for the baggage, advances against 
<A NAME="122"></A>the enemy with twenty-five cohorts and a large body of cavalry, and, leaving 
<A NAME="123"></A>the space of a mile between them, fortifies his camp. There was between 
<A NAME="124"></A>Labienus and the enemy a river difficult to cross, and with steep banks: 
<A NAME="125"></A>this neither did he himself design to cross, nor did he suppose the enemy 
<A NAME="126"></A>would cross it. Their hope of auxiliaries was daily increasing. He [Labienus] 
<A NAME="127"></A>openly says in a council that "since the Germans are said to be approaching, 
<A NAME="128"></A>he would not bring into uncertainty his own and the army's fortunes, and 
<A NAME="129"></A>the next day would move his camp at early dawn." These words are quickly 
<A NAME="130"></A>carried to the enemy, since out of so large a number of cavalry composed 
<A NAME="131"></A>of Gauls, nature compelled some to favor the Gallic interests. Labienus, 
<A NAME="132"></A>having assembled the tribunes of the soldiers and principal centurions 
<A NAME="133"></A>by night, states what his design is, and, that he may the more easily give 
<A NAME="134"></A>the enemy a belief of his fears, he orders the camp to be moved with greater 
<A NAME="135"></A>noise and confusion than was usual with the Roman people. By these means 
<A NAME="136"></A>he makes his departure [appear] like a retreat. These things, also, since 
<A NAME="137"></A>the camps were so near, are reported to the enemy by scouts before 
<A NAME="138"></A>daylight.
<A NAME="139"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 8</B>
<A NAME="140"></A><BR><BR>Scarcely had the rear advanced beyond the fortifications when the 
<A NAME="141"></A>Gauls, encouraging one another "not to cast from their hands the anticipated 
<A NAME="142"></A>booty, that it was a tedious thing, while the Romans were panic-stricken, 
<A NAME="143"></A>to be waiting for the aid of the Germans, and that their dignity did not 
<A NAME="144"></A>suffer them to fear to attack with such great forces so small a band, particularly 
<A NAME="145"></A>when retreating and encumbered," do not hesitate to cross the river and 
<A NAME="146"></A>give battle in a disadvantageous position. Labienus suspecting that these 
<A NAME="147"></A>things would happen, was proceeding quietly, and using the same pretense 
<A NAME="148"></A>of a march, in order that he might entice them across the river. Then, 
<A NAME="149"></A>having sent forward the baggage some short distance and placed it on a 
<A NAME="150"></A>certain eminence, he says, "Soldiers, you have the opportunity you have 
<A NAME="151"></A>sought: you hold the enemy in an encumbered and disadvantageous position: 
<A NAME="152"></A>display to us, your leaders, the same valor you have ofttimes displayed 
<A NAME="153"></A>to your general: imagine that he is present and actually sees these exploits." 
<A NAME="154"></A>At the same time he orders the troops to face about toward the enemy and 
<A NAME="155"></A>form in line of battle, and, dispatching a few troops of cavalry as a guard 
<A NAME="156"></A>for the baggage, he places the rest of the horse on the wings. Our men, 
<A NAME="157"></A>raising a shout, quickly throw their javelins at the enemy. They, when, 
<A NAME="158"></A>contrary to their expectation, they saw those whom they believed to be 
<A NAME="159"></A>retreating, advance toward them with threatening banners, were not able 
<A NAME="160"></A>to sustain even the charge, and, being put to flight at the first onslaught, 
<A NAME="161"></A>sought the nearest woods; Labienus pursuing them with the cavalry, upon 
<A NAME="162"></A>a large number being slain, and several taken prisoners, got possession 
<A NAME="163"></A>of the state a few days after; for the Germans, who were coming to the 
<A NAME="164"></A>aid of the Treviri, having been informed of their flight, retreated to 
<A NAME="165"></A>their homes. The relations of Indutiomarus, who had been the promoters 
<A NAME="166"></A>of the revolt, accompanying them, quitted their own state with them. The 
<A NAME="167"></A>supreme power and government were delivered to Cingetorix, whom we have 
<A NAME="168"></A>stated to have remained firm in his allegiance from the 
<A NAME="169"></A>commencement.
<A NAME="170"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 9</B>
<A NAME="171"></A><BR><BR>Caesar, after he came from the territories of the Menapii into 
<A NAME="172"></A>those of the Treviri, resolved for two reasons to cross the Rhine; one 
<A NAME="173"></A>of which was, because they had sent assistance to the Treviri against him; 
<A NAME="174"></A>the other, that Ambiorix might not have a retreat among them. Having determined 
<A NAME="175"></A>on these matters, he began to build a bridge a little above that place 
<A NAME="176"></A>where he had before conveyed over his army. The plan having been known 
<A NAME="177"></A>and laid down, the work is accomplished in a few days by the great exertion 
<A NAME="178"></A>of the soldiers. Having left a strong guard at the bridge on the side of 
<A NAME="179"></A>the Treviri, lest any commotion should suddenly arise among them, he leads 
<A NAME="180"></A>over the rest of the forces and the cavalry. The Ubii, who before had sent 
<A NAME="181"></A>hostages and come to a capitulation, send embassadors to him, for the purpose 
<A NAME="182"></A>of vindicating themselves, to assure him that "neither had auxiliaries 
<A NAME="183"></A>been sent to the Treviri from their state, nor had they violated their 
<A NAME="184"></A>allegiance;" they entreat and beseech him "to spare them, lest, in his 
<A NAME="185"></A>common hatred of the Germans, the innocent should suffer the penalty of 
<A NAME="186"></A>the guilty: they promise to give more hostages, if he desire them." Having 
<A NAME="187"></A>investigated the case, Caesar finds that the auxiliaries had been sent 
<A NAME="188"></A>by the Suevi; he accepts the apology of the Ubii, and makes the minute 
<A NAME="189"></A>inquiries concerning the approaches and the routes to the territories of 
<A NAME="190"></A>the Suevi.
<A NAME="191"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 10</B>
<A NAME="192"></A><BR><BR>In the mean time he is informed by the Ubii, a few days after, 
<A NAME="193"></A>that the Suevi are drawing all their forces into one place, and are giving 
<A NAME="194"></A>orders to those nations which are under their government to send auxiliaries 
<A NAME="195"></A>of infantry and of cavalry. Having learned these things, he provides a 
<A NAME="196"></A>supply of corn, selects a proper place for his camp, and commands the Ubii 
<A NAME="197"></A>to drive off their cattle and carry away all their possessions from the 
<A NAME="198"></A>country parts into the towns, hoping that they, being a barbarous and ignorant 
<A NAME="199"></A>people, when harassed by the want of provisions, might be brought to an 
<A NAME="200"></A>engagement on disadvantageous terms: he orders them to send numerous scouts 
<A NAME="201"></A>among the Suevi, and learn what things are going on among them. They execute 
<A NAME="202"></A>the orders, and, a few days having intervened, report that all the Suevi, 
<A NAME="203"></A>after certain intelligence concerning the army of the Romans had come, 
<A NAME="204"></A>retreated with all their own forces and those of their allies, which they 
<A NAME="205"></A>had assembled, to the utmost extremities of their territories: that there 
<A NAME="206"></A>is a wood there of very great extent, which is called Bacenis; that this 
<A NAME="207"></A>stretches a great way into the interior, and, being opposed as a natural 
<A NAME="208"></A>barrier, defends from injuries and incursions the Cherusci against the 
<A NAME="209"></A>Suevi, and the Suevi against the Cherusci: that at the entrance of that 
<A NAME="210"></A>forest the Suevi had determined to await the coming up of the 
<A NAME="211"></A>Romans.
<A NAME="212"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 11</B>
<A NAME="213"></A><BR><BR>Since we have come to the place, it does not appear to be foreign 
<A NAME="214"></A>to our subject to lay before the reader an account of the manners of Gaul 
<A NAME="215"></A>and Germany, and wherein these nations differ from each other. In Gaul 
<A NAME="216"></A>there are factions not only in all the states, and in all the cantons and 
<A NAME="217"></A>their divisions, but almost in each family, and of these factions those 
<A NAME="218"></A>are the leaders who are considered according to their judgment to possess 
<A NAME="219"></A>the greatest influence, upon whose will and determination the management 
<A NAME="220"></A>of all affairs and measures depends. And that seems to have been instituted 
<A NAME="221"></A>in ancient times with this view, that no one of the common people should 
<A NAME="222"></A>be in want of support against one more powerful; for, none [of those leaders] 
<A NAME="223"></A>suffers his party to be oppressed and defrauded, and if he do otherwise, 
<A NAME="224"></A>he has no influence among his party. This same policy exists throughout 
<A NAME="225"></A>the whole of Gaul; for all the states are divided into two 
<A NAME="226"></A>factions.
<A NAME="227"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 12</B>
<A NAME="228"></A><BR><BR>When Caesar arrived in Gaul, the Aedui were the leaders of one 
<A NAME="229"></A>faction, the Sequani of the other. Since the latter were less powerful 
<A NAME="230"></A>by themselves, inasmuch as the chief influence was from of old among the 
<A NAME="231"></A>Aedui, and their dependencies were great, they had united to themselves 
<A NAME="232"></A>the Germans and Ariovistus, and had brought them over to their party by 
<A NAME="233"></A>great sacrifices and promises. And having fought several successful battles 
<A NAME="234"></A>and slain all the nobility of the Aedui, they had so far surpassed them 
<A NAME="235"></A>in power, that they brought over, from the Aedui to themselves, a large 
<A NAME="236"></A>portion of their dependents and received from them the sons of their leading 
<A NAME="237"></A>men as hostages, and compelled them to swear in their public character 
<A NAME="238"></A>that they would enter into no design against them; and held a portion of 
<A NAME="239"></A>the neighboring land, seized on by force, and possessed the sovereignty 
<A NAME="240"></A>of the whole of Gaul. Divitiacus urged by this necessity, had proceeded 
<A NAME="241"></A>to Rome to the senate, for the purpose of entreating assistance, and had 
<A NAME="242"></A>returned without accomplishing his object. A change of affairs ensued on 
<A NAME="243"></A>the arrival of Caesar, the hostages were returned to the Aedui, their old 
<A NAME="244"></A>dependencies restored, and new acquired through Caesar (because those who 
<A NAME="245"></A>had attached themselves to their alliance saw that they enjoyed a better 
<A NAME="246"></A>state and a milder government), their other interests, their influence, 
<A NAME="247"></A>their reputation were likewise increased, and in consequence, the Sequani 
<A NAME="248"></A>lost the sovereignty. The Remi succeeded to their place, and, as it was 
<A NAME="249"></A>perceived that they equaled the Aedui in favor with Caesar, those, who 
<A NAME="250"></A>on account of their old animosities could by no means coalesce with the 
<A NAME="251"></A>Aedui, consigned themselves in clientship to the Remi. The latter carefully 
<A NAME="252"></A>protected them. Thus they possessed both a new and suddenly acquired influence. 
<A NAME="253"></A>Affairs were then in that position that the Aedui were considered by far 
<A NAME="254"></A>the leading people, and the Remi held the second post of 
<A NAME="255"></A>honor.
<A NAME="256"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 13</B>
<A NAME="257"></A><BR><BR>Throughout all Gaul there are two orders of those men who are of 
<A NAME="258"></A>any rank and dignity: for the commonality is held almost in the condition 
<A NAME="259"></A>of slaves, and dares to undertake nothing of itself, and is admitted to 
<A NAME="260"></A>no deliberation. The greater part, when they are pressed either by debt, 
<A NAME="261"></A>or the large amount of their tributes, or the oppression of the more powerful, 
<A NAME="262"></A>give themselves up in vassalage to the nobles, who possess over them the 
<A NAME="263"></A>same rights without exception as masters over their slaves. But of these 
<A NAME="264"></A>two orders, one is that of the Druids, the other that of the knights. The 
<A NAME="265"></A>former are engaged in things sacred, conduct the public and the private 
<A NAME="266"></A>sacrifices, and interpret all matters of religion. To these a large number 
<A NAME="267"></A>of the young men resort for the purpose of instruction, and they [the Druids] 
<A NAME="268"></A>are in great honor among them. For they determine respecting almost all 
<A NAME="269"></A>controversies, public and private; and if any crime has been perpetrated, 
<A NAME="270"></A>if murder has been committed, if there be any dispute about an inheritance, 
<A NAME="271"></A>if any about boundaries, these same persons decide it; they decree rewards 
<A NAME="272"></A>and punishments; if any one, either in a private or public capacity, has 
<A NAME="273"></A>not submitted to their decision, they interdict him from the sacrifices. 
<A NAME="274"></A>This among them is the most heavy punishment. Those who have been thus 
<A NAME="275"></A>interdicted are esteemed in the number of the impious and the criminal: 
<A NAME="276"></A>all shun them, and avoid their society and conversation, lest they receive 
<A NAME="277"></A>some evil from their contact; nor is justice administered to them when 
<A NAME="278"></A>seeking it, nor is any dignity bestowed on them. Over all these Druids 
<A NAME="279"></A>one presides, who possesses supreme authority among them. Upon his death, 
<A NAME="280"></A>if any individual among the rest is pre-eminent in dignity, he succeeds; 
<A NAME="281"></A>but, if there are many equal, the election is made by the suffrages of 
<A NAME="282"></A>the Druids; sometimes they even contend for the presidency with arms. These 
<A NAME="283"></A>assemble at a fixed period of the year in a consecrated place in the territories 
<A NAME="284"></A>of the Carnutes, which is reckoned the central region of the whole of Gaul. 
<A NAME="285"></A>Hither all, who have disputes, assemble from every part, and submit to 
<A NAME="286"></A>their decrees and determinations. This institution is supposed to have 
<A NAME="287"></A>been devised in Britain, and to have been brought over from it into Gaul; 
<A NAME="288"></A>and now those who desire to gain a more accurate knowledge of that system 
<A NAME="289"></A>generally proceed thither for the purpose of studying 
<A NAME="290"></A>it.
<A NAME="291"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 14</B>
<A NAME="292"></A><BR><BR>The Druids do not go to war, nor pay tribute together with the 
<A NAME="293"></A>rest; they have an exemption from military service and a dispensation in 
<A NAME="294"></A>all matters. Induced by such great advantages, many embrace this profession 
<A NAME="295"></A>of their own accord, and [many] are sent to it by their parents and relations. 
<A NAME="296"></A>They are said there to learn by heart a great number of verses; accordingly 
<A NAME="297"></A>some remain in the course of training twenty years. Nor do they regard 
<A NAME="298"></A>it lawful to commit these to writing, though in almost all other matters, 
<A NAME="299"></A>in their public and private transactions, they use Greek characters. That 
<A NAME="300"></A>practice they seem to me to have adopted for two reasons; because they 
<A NAME="301"></A>neither desire their doctrines to be divulged among the mass of the people, 
<A NAME="302"></A>nor those who learn, to devote themselves the less to the efforts of memory, 
<A NAME="303"></A>relying on writing; since it generally occurs to most men, that, in their 
<A NAME="304"></A>dependence on writing, they relax their diligence in learning thoroughly, 
<A NAME="305"></A>and their employment of the memory. They wish to inculcate this as one 
<A NAME="306"></A>of their leading tenets, that souls do not become extinct, but pass after 
<A NAME="307"></A>death from one body to another, and they think that men by this tenet are 
<A NAME="308"></A>in a great degree excited to valor, the fear of death being disregarded. 
<A NAME="309"></A>They likewise discuss and impart to the youth many things respecting the 
<A NAME="310"></A>stars and their motion, respecting the extent of the world and of our earth, 
<A NAME="311"></A>respecting the nature of things, respecting the power and the majesty of 
<A NAME="312"></A>the immortal gods.
<A NAME="313"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 15</B>
<A NAME="314"></A><BR><BR>The other order is that of the knights. These, when there is occasion 
<A NAME="315"></A>and any war occurs (which before Caesar's arrival was for the most part 
<A NAME="316"></A>wont to happen every year, as either they on their part were inflecting 
<A NAME="317"></A>injuries or repelling those which others inflected on them), are all engaged 
<A NAME="318"></A>in war. And those of them most distinguished by birth and resources, have 
<A NAME="319"></A>the greatest number of vassals and dependents about them. They acknowledge 
<A NAME="320"></A>this sort of influence and power only.
<A NAME="321"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 16</B>
<A NAME="322"></A><BR><BR>The nation of all the Gauls is extremely devoted to superstitious 
<A NAME="323"></A>rites; and on that account they who are troubled with unusually severe 
<A NAME="324"></A>diseases, and they who are engaged in battles and dangers, either sacrifice 
<A NAME="325"></A>men as victims, or vow that they will sacrifice them, and employ the Druids 
<A NAME="326"></A>as the performers of those sacrifices; because they think that unless the 
<A NAME="327"></A>life of a man be offered for the life of a man, the mind of the immortal 
<A NAME="328"></A>gods can not be rendered propitious, and they have sacrifices of that kind 
<A NAME="329"></A>ordained for national purposes. Others have figures of vast size, the limbs 
<A NAME="330"></A>of which formed of osiers they fill with living men, which being set on 
<A NAME="331"></A>fire, the men perish enveloped in the flames. They consider that the oblation 
<A NAME="332"></A>of such as have been taken in theft, or in robbery, or any other offense, 
<A NAME="333"></A>is more acceptable to the immortal gods; but when a supply of that class 
<A NAME="334"></A>is wanting, they have recourse to the oblation of even the 
<A NAME="335"></A>innocent.
<A NAME="336"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 17</B>
<A NAME="337"></A><BR><BR>They worship as their divinity, Mercury in particular, and have 
<A NAME="338"></A>many images of him, and regard him as the inventor of all arts, they consider 
<A NAME="339"></A>him the guide of their journeys and marches, and believe him to have great 
<A NAME="340"></A>influence over the acquisition of gain and mercantile transactions. Next 
<A NAME="341"></A>to him they worship Apollo, and Mars, and Jupiter, and Minerva; respecting 
<A NAME="342"></A>these deities they have for the most part the same belief as other nations: 
<A NAME="343"></A>that Apollo averts diseases, that Minerva imparts the invention of manufactures, 
<A NAME="344"></A>that Jupiter possesses the sovereignty of the heavenly powers; that Mars 
<A NAME="345"></A>presides over wars. To him, when they have determined to engage in battle, 
<A NAME="346"></A>they commonly vow those things which they shall take in war. When they 
<A NAME="347"></A>have conquered, they sacrifice whatever captured animals may have survived 
<A NAME="348"></A>the conflict, and collect the other things into one place. In many states 
<A NAME="349"></A>you may see piles of these things heaped up in their consecrated spots; 
<A NAME="350"></A>nor does it often happen that any one, disregarding the sanctity of the 
<A NAME="351"></A>case, dares either to secrete in his house things captured, or take away 
<A NAME="352"></A>those deposited; and the most severe punishment, with torture, has been 
<A NAME="353"></A>established for such a deed.
<A NAME="354"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 18</B>
<A NAME="355"></A><BR><BR>All the Gauls assert that they are descended from the god Dis, 
<A NAME="356"></A>and say that this tradition has been handed down by the Druids. For that 
<A NAME="357"></A>reason they compute the divisions of every season, not by the number of 
<A NAME="358"></A>days, but of nights; they keep birthdays and the beginnings of months and 
<A NAME="359"></A>years in such an order that the day follows the night. Among the other 
<A NAME="360"></A>usages of their life, they differ in this from almost all other nations, 
<A NAME="361"></A>that they do not permit their children to approach them openly until they 
<A NAME="362"></A>are grown up so as to be able to bear the service of war; and they regard 
<A NAME="363"></A>it as indecorous for a son of boyish age to stand in public in the presence 
<A NAME="364"></A>of his father.
<A NAME="365"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 19</B>
<A NAME="366"></A><BR><BR>Whatever sums of money the husbands have received in the name of 
<A NAME="367"></A>dowry from their wives, making an estimate of it, they add the same amount 
<A NAME="368"></A>out of their own estates. An account is kept of all this money conjointly, 
<A NAME="369"></A>and the profits are laid by: whichever of them shall have survived [the 
<A NAME="370"></A>other], to that one the portion of both reverts together with the profits 
<A NAME="371"></A>of the previous time. Husbands have power of life and death over their 
<A NAME="372"></A>wives as well as over their children: and when the father of a family, 
<A NAME="373"></A>born in a more than commonly distinguished rank, has died, his relations 
<A NAME="374"></A>assemble, and, if the circumstances of his death are suspicious, hold an 
<A NAME="375"></A>investigation upon the wives in the manner adopted toward slaves; and, 
<A NAME="376"></A>if proof be obtained, put them to severe torture, and kill them. Their 
<A NAME="377"></A>funerals, considering the state of civilization among the Gauls, are magnificent 
<A NAME="378"></A>and costly; and they cast into the fire all things, including living creatures, 
<A NAME="379"></A>which they suppose to have been dear to them when alive; and, a little 
<A NAME="380"></A>before this period, slaves and dependents, who were ascertained to have 
<A NAME="381"></A>been beloved by them, were, after the regular funeral rites were completed, 
<A NAME="382"></A>burnt together with them.
<A NAME="383"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 20</B>
<A NAME="384"></A><BR><BR>Those states which are considered to conduct their commonwealth 
<A NAME="385"></A>more judiciously, have it ordained by their laws, that, if any person shall 
<A NAME="386"></A>have heard by rumor and report from his neighbors any thing concerning 
<A NAME="387"></A>the commonwealth, he shall convey it to the magistrate, and not impart 
<A NAME="388"></A>it to any other; because it has been discovered that inconsiderate and 
<A NAME="389"></A>inexperienced men were often alarmed by false reports, and driven to some 
<A NAME="390"></A>rash act, or else took hasty measures in affairs of the highest importance. 
<A NAME="391"></A>The magistrates conceal those things which require to be kept unknown; 
<A NAME="392"></A>and they disclose to the people whatever they determine to be expedient. 
<A NAME="393"></A>It is not lawful to speak of the commonwealth, except in 
<A NAME="394"></A>council.
<A NAME="395"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 21</B>
<A NAME="396"></A><BR><BR>The Germans differ much from these usages, for they have neither 
<A NAME="397"></A>Druids to preside over sacred offices, nor do they pay great regard to 
<A NAME="398"></A>sacrifices. They rank in the number of the gods those alone whom they behold, 
<A NAME="399"></A>and by whose instrumentality they are obviously benefited, namely, the 
<A NAME="400"></A>sun, fire, and the moon; they have not heard of the other deities even 
<A NAME="401"></A>by report. Their whole life is occupied in hunting and in the pursuits 
<A NAME="402"></A>of the military art; from childhood they devote themselves to fatigue and 
<A NAME="403"></A>hardships. Those who have remained chaste for the longest time, receive 
<A NAME="404"></A>the greatest commendation among their people; they think that by this the 
<A NAME="405"></A>growth is promoted, by this the physical powers are increased and the sinews 
<A NAME="406"></A>are strengthened. And to have had knowledge of a woman before the twentieth 
<A NAME="407"></A>year they reckon among the most disgraceful acts; of which matter there 
<A NAME="408"></A>is no concealment, because they bathe promiscuously in the rivers and [only] 
<A NAME="409"></A>use skins or small cloaks of deer's hides, a large portion of the body 
<A NAME="410"></A>being in consequence naked.
<A NAME="411"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 22</B>
<A NAME="412"></A><BR><BR>They do not pay much attention to agriculture, and a large portion 
<A NAME="413"></A>of their food consists in milk, cheese, and flesh; nor has any one a fixed 
<A NAME="414"></A>quantity of land or his own individual limits; but the magistrates and 
<A NAME="415"></A>the leading men each year apportion to the tribes and families, who have 
<A NAME="416"></A>united together, as much land as, and in the place in which, they think 
<A NAME="417"></A>proper, and the year after compel them to remove elsewhere. For this enactment 
<A NAME="418"></A>they advance many reasons - lest seduced by long-continued custom, they 
<A NAME="419"></A>may exchange their ardor in the waging of war for agriculture; lest they 
<A NAME="420"></A>may be anxious to acquire extensive estates, and the more powerful drive 
<A NAME="421"></A>the weaker from their possessions; lest they construct their houses with 
<A NAME="422"></A>too great a desire to avoid cold and heat; lest the desire of wealth spring 
<A NAME="423"></A>up, from which cause divisions and discords arise; and that they may keep 
<A NAME="424"></A>the common people in a contented state of mind, when each sees his own 
<A NAME="425"></A>means placed on an equality with [those of] the most 
<A NAME="426"></A>powerful.
<A NAME="427"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 23</B>
<A NAME="428"></A><BR><BR>It is the greatest glory to the several states to have as wide 
<A NAME="429"></A>deserts as possible around them, their frontiers having been laid waste. 
<A NAME="430"></A>They consider this the real evidence of their prowess, that their neighbors 
<A NAME="431"></A>shall be driven out of their lands and abandon them, and that no one dare 
<A NAME="432"></A>settle near them; at the same time they think that they shall be on that 
<A NAME="433"></A>account the more secure, because they have removed the apprehension of 
<A NAME="434"></A>a sudden incursion. When a state either repels war waged against it, or 
<A NAME="435"></A>wages it against another, magistrates are chosen to preside over that war 
<A NAME="436"></A>with such authority, that they have power of life and death. In peace there 
<A NAME="437"></A>is no common magistrate, but the chiefs of provinces and cantons administer 
<A NAME="438"></A>justice and determine controversies among their own people. Robberies which 
<A NAME="439"></A>are committed beyond the boundaries of each state bear no infamy, and they 
<A NAME="440"></A>avow that these are committed for the purpose of disciplining their youth 
<A NAME="441"></A>and of preventing sloth. And when any of their chiefs has said in an assembly 
<A NAME="442"></A>"that he will be their leader, let those who are willing to follow, give 
<A NAME="443"></A>in their names;" they who approve of both the enterprise and the man arise 
<A NAME="444"></A>and promise their assistance and are applauded by the people; such of them 
<A NAME="445"></A>as have not followed him are accounted in the number of deserters and traitors, 
<A NAME="446"></A>and confidence in all matters is afterward refused them. To injure guests 
<A NAME="447"></A>they regard as impious; they defend from wrong those who have come to them 
<A NAME="448"></A>for any purpose whatever, and esteem them inviolable; to them the houses 
<A NAME="449"></A>of all are open and maintenance is freely supplied.
<A NAME="450"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 24</B>
<A NAME="451"></A><BR><BR>And there was formerly a time when the Gauls excelled the Germans 
<A NAME="452"></A>in prowess, and waged war on them offensively, and, on account of the great 
<A NAME="453"></A>number of their people and the insufficiency of their land, sent colonies 
<A NAME="454"></A>over the Rhine. Accordingly, the Volcae Tectosages, seized on those parts 
<A NAME="455"></A>of Germany which are the most fruitful [and lie] around the Hercynian forest, 
<A NAME="456"></A>(which, I perceive, was known by report to Eratosthenes and some other 
<A NAME="457"></A>Greeks, and which they call Orcynia), and settled there. Which nation to 
<A NAME="458"></A>this time retains its position in those settlements, and has a very high 
<A NAME="459"></A>character for justice and military merit; now also they continue in the 
<A NAME="460"></A>same scarcity, indigence, hardihood, as the Germans, and use the same food 
<A NAME="461"></A>and dress; but their proximity to the Province and knowledge of commodities 
<A NAME="462"></A>from countries beyond the sea supplies to the Gauls many things tending 
<A NAME="463"></A>to luxury as well as civilization. Accustomed by degrees to be overmatched 
<A NAME="464"></A>and worsted in many engagements, they do not even compare themselves to 
<A NAME="465"></A>the Germans in prowess.
<A NAME="466"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 25</B>
<A NAME="467"></A><BR><BR>The breadth of this Hercynian forest, which has been referred to 
<A NAME="468"></A>above, is to a quick traveler, a journey of nine days. For it can not be 
<A NAME="469"></A>otherwise computed, nor are they acquainted with the measures of roads. 
<A NAME="470"></A>It begins at the frontiers of the Helvetii, Nemetes, and Rauraci, and extends 
<A NAME="471"></A>in a right line along the river Danube to the territories of the Daci and 
<A NAME="472"></A>the Anartes; it bends thence to the left in a different direction from 
<A NAME="473"></A>the river, and owing to its extent touches the confines of many nations; 
<A NAME="474"></A>nor is there any person belonging to this part of Germany who says that 
<A NAME="475"></A>he either has gone to the extremity of that forest, though he had advanced 
<A NAME="476"></A>a journey of sixty days, or has heard in what place it begins. It is certain 
<A NAME="477"></A>that many kinds of wild beast are produced in it which have not been seen 
<A NAME="478"></A>in other parts; of which the following are such as differ principally from 
<A NAME="479"></A>other animals, and appear worthy of being committed to 
<A NAME="480"></A>record.
<A NAME="481"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 26</B>
<A NAME="482"></A><BR><BR>There is an ox of the shape of a stag, between whose ears a horn 
<A NAME="483"></A>rises from the middle of the forehead, higher and straighter than those 
<A NAME="484"></A>horns which are known to us. From the top of this, branches, like palms, 
<A NAME="485"></A>stretch out a considerable distance. The shape of the female and of the 
<A NAME="486"></A>male is the, same; the appearance and the size of the horns is the 
<A NAME="487"></A>same.
<A NAME="488"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 27</B>
<A NAME="489"></A><BR><BR>There are also [animals] which are called elks. The shape of these, 
<A NAME="490"></A>and the varied color of their skins, is much like roes, but in size they 
<A NAME="491"></A>surpass them a little and are destitute of horns, and have legs without 
<A NAME="492"></A>joints and ligatures; nor do they lie down for the purpose of rest, nor, 
<A NAME="493"></A>if they have been thrown down by any accident, can they raise or lift themselves 
<A NAME="494"></A>up. Trees serve as beds to them; they lean themselves against them, and 
<A NAME="495"></A>thus reclining only slightly, they take their rest; when the huntsmen have 
<A NAME="496"></A>discovered from the footsteps of these animals whither they are accustomed 
<A NAME="497"></A>to betake themselves, they either undermine all the trees at the roots, 
<A NAME="498"></A>or cut into them so far that the upper part of the trees may appear to 
<A NAME="499"></A>be left standing. When they have leant upon them, according to their habit, 
<A NAME="500"></A>they knock down by their weight the unsupported trees, and fall down themselves 
<A NAME="501"></A>along with them.
<A NAME="502"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 28</B>
<A NAME="503"></A><BR><BR>There is a third kind, consisting of those animals which are called 
<A NAME="504"></A>uri. These are a little below the elephant in size, and of the appearance, 
<A NAME="505"></A>color, and shape of a bull. Their strength and speed are extraordinary; 
<A NAME="506"></A>they spare neither man nor wild beast which they have espied. These the 
<A NAME="507"></A>Germans take with much pains in pits and kill them. The young men harden 
<A NAME="508"></A>themselves with this exercise, and practice themselves in this kind of 
<A NAME="509"></A>hunting, and those who have slain the greatest number of them, having produced 
<A NAME="510"></A>the horns in public, to serve as evidence, receive great praise. But not 
<A NAME="511"></A>even when taken very young can they be rendered familiar to men and tamed. 
<A NAME="512"></A>The size, shape, and appearance of their horns differ much from the horns 
<A NAME="513"></A>of our oxen. These they anxiously seek after, and bind at the tips with 
<A NAME="514"></A>silver, and use as cups at their most sumptuous entertainments.
<A NAME="515"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 29</B>
<A NAME="516"></A><BR><BR>Caesar, after he discovered through the Ubian scouts that the Suevi 
<A NAME="517"></A>had retired into their woods, apprehending a scarcity of corn, because, 
<A NAME="518"></A>as we have observed above, all the Germans pay very little attention to 
<A NAME="519"></A>agriculture, resolved not to proceed any further; but, that he might not 
<A NAME="520"></A>altogether relieve the barbarians from the fear of his return, and that 
<A NAME="521"></A>he might delay their succors, having led back his army, he breaks down, 
<A NAME="522"></A>to the length of 200 feet, the further end of the bridge, which joined 
<A NAME="523"></A>the banks of the Ubii, and at the extremity of the bridge raises towers 
<A NAME="524"></A>of four stories, and stations a guard of twelve cohorts for the purpose 
<A NAME="525"></A>of defending the bridge, and strengthens the place with considerable fortifications. 
<A NAME="526"></A>Over that fort and guard he appointed C. Volcatius Tullus, a young man; 
<A NAME="527"></A>he himself, when the corn began to ripen, having set forth for the war 
<A NAME="528"></A>with Ambiorix (through the forest Arduenna, which is the largest of all 
<A NAME="529"></A>Gaul, and reaches from the banks of the Rhine and the frontiers of the 
<A NAME="530"></A>Treviri to those of the Nervii, and extends over more than 500 miles), 
<A NAME="531"></A>he sends forward L. Minucius Basilus with all the cavalry, to try if he 
<A NAME="532"></A>might gain any advantage by rapid marches and the advantage of time, he 
<A NAME="533"></A>warns him to forbid fires being made in the camp, lest any indication of 
<A NAME="534"></A>his approach be given at a distance: he tells him that he will follow 
<A NAME="535"></A>immediately.
<A NAME="536"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 30</B>
<A NAME="537"></A><BR><BR>Basilus does as he was commanded; having performed his march rapidly, 
<A NAME="538"></A>and even surpassed the expectations of all, he surprises in the fields 
<A NAME="539"></A>many not expecting him; through their information he advances toward Ambiorix 
<A NAME="540"></A>himself, to the place in which he was said to be with a few horse. Fortune 
<A NAME="541"></A>accomplishes much, not only in other matters, but also in the art of war. 
<A NAME="542"></A>For as it happened by a remarkable chance, that he fell upon [Ambiorix] 
<A NAME="543"></A>himself unguarded and unprepared, and that his arrival was seen by the 
<A NAME="544"></A>people before the report or information of his arrival was carried thither; 
<A NAME="545"></A>so it was an incident of extraordinary fortune that, although every implement 
<A NAME="546"></A>of war which he was accustomed to have about him was seized, and his chariots 
<A NAME="547"></A>and horses surprised, yet he himself escaped death. But it was effected 
<A NAME="548"></A>owing to this circumstance, that his house being surrounded by a wood (as 
<A NAME="549"></A>are generally the dwellings of the Gauls, who, for the purpose of avoiding 
<A NAME="550"></A>heat, mostly seek the neighborhood of woods and rivers), his attendants 
<A NAME="551"></A>and friends in a narrow spot sustained for a short time the attack of our 
<A NAME="552"></A>horse. While they were fighting, one of his followers mounted him on a 
<A NAME="553"></A>horse; the woods sheltered him as he fled. Thus fortune tended much both 
<A NAME="554"></A>toward his encountering and his escaping danger.
<A NAME="555"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 31</B>
<A NAME="556"></A><BR><BR>Whether Ambiorix did not collect his forces from cool deliberation, 
<A NAME="557"></A>because he considered he ought not to engage in a battle, or [whether] 
<A NAME="558"></A>he was debarred by time and prevented by the sudden arrival of our horse, 
<A NAME="559"></A>when he supposed the rest of the army was closely following, is doubtful: 
<A NAME="560"></A>but certainly, dispatching messengers through the country, he ordered every 
<A NAME="561"></A>one to provide for himself; and a part of them fled into the forest Arduenna, 
<A NAME="562"></A>a part into the extensive morasses; those who were nearest the ocean concealed 
<A NAME="563"></A>themselves in the islands which the tides usually form; many, departing 
<A NAME="564"></A>from their territories, committed themselves and all their possessions 
<A NAME="565"></A>to perfect strangers. Cativolcus, king of one half of the Eburones, who 
<A NAME="566"></A>had entered into the design together with Ambiorix, since, being now worn 
<A NAME="567"></A>out by age, he was unable to endure the fatigue either of war or flight, 
<A NAME="568"></A>having cursed Ambiorix with every imprecation, as the person who had been 
<A NAME="569"></A>the contriver of that measure, destroyed himself with the juice of the 
<A NAME="570"></A>yew-tree, of which there is a great abundance in Gaul and 
<A NAME="571"></A>Germany.
<A NAME="572"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 32</B>
<A NAME="573"></A><BR><BR>The Segui and Condrusi, of the nation and number of the Germans, 
<A NAME="574"></A>and who are between the Eburones and the Treviri, sent embassadors to Caesar 
<A NAME="575"></A>to entreat that he would not regard them in the number of his enemies, 
<A NAME="576"></A>nor consider that the cause of all the Germans on this side the Rhine was 
<A NAME="577"></A>one and the same; that they had formed no plans of war, and had sent no 
<A NAME="578"></A>auxiliaries to Ambiorix. Caesar, having ascertained this fact by an examination 
<A NAME="579"></A>of his prisoners, commanded that if any of the Eburones in their flight 
<A NAME="580"></A>had repaired to them, they should be sent back to him; he assures them 
<A NAME="581"></A>that if they did that, he will not injure their territories. Then, having 
<A NAME="582"></A>divided his forces into three parts, he sent the baggage of all the legions 
<A NAME="583"></A>to Aduatuca. That is the name of a fort. This is nearly in the middle of 
<A NAME="584"></A>the Eburones, where Titurius and Aurunculeius had been quartered for the 
<A NAME="585"></A>purpose of wintering. This place he selected as well on other accounts 
<A NAME="586"></A>as because the fortifications of the previous year remained, in order that 
<A NAME="587"></A>he might relieve the labor of the soldiers. He left the fourteenth legion 
<A NAME="588"></A>as a guard for the baggage, one of those three which he had lately raised 
<A NAME="589"></A>in Italy and brought over. Over that legion and camp he places Q. Tullius 
<A NAME="590"></A>Cicero and gives him 200 horse.
<A NAME="591"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 33</B>
<A NAME="592"></A><BR><BR>Having divided the army, he orders T. Labienus to proceed with 
<A NAME="593"></A>three legions toward the ocean into those parts which border on the Menapii; 
<A NAME="594"></A>he sends C. Trebonius with a like number of legions to lay waste that district 
<A NAME="595"></A>which lies contiguous to the Aduatuci; he himself determines to go with 
<A NAME="596"></A>the remaining three to the river Sambre, which flows into the Meuse, and 
<A NAME="597"></A>to the most remote parts of Arduenna, whither he heard that Ambiorix had 
<A NAME="598"></A>gone with a few horse. When departing, he promises that he will return 
<A NAME="599"></A>before the end of the seventh day, on which day he was aware corn was due 
<A NAME="600"></A>to that legion which was being left in garrison. He directs Labienus and 
<A NAME="601"></A>Trebonius to return by the same day, if they can do so agreeably to the 
<A NAME="602"></A>interests of the republic; so that their measures having been mutually 
<A NAME="603"></A>imparted, and the plans of the enemy having been discovered, they might 
<A NAME="604"></A>be able to commence a different line of operations.
<A NAME="605"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 34</B>
<A NAME="606"></A><BR><BR>There was, as we have above observed, no regular army, nor a town, 
<A NAME="607"></A>nor a garrison which could defend itself by arms; but the people were scattered 
<A NAME="608"></A>in all directions. Where either a hidden valley, or a woody spot, or a 
<A NAME="609"></A>difficult morass furnished any hope of protection or of security to any 
<A NAME="610"></A>one, there he had fixed himself. These places were known to those who dwelt 
<A NAME="611"></A>in the neighborhood, and the matter demanded great attention, not so much 
<A NAME="612"></A>in protecting the main body of the army (for no peril could occur to them 
<A NAME="613"></A>altogether from those alarmed and scattered troops), as in preserving individual 
<A NAME="614"></A>soldiers; which in some measure tended to the safety of the army. For both 
<A NAME="615"></A>the desire of booty was leading many too far, and the woods with their 
<A NAME="616"></A>unknown and hidden routes would not allow them to go in large bodies. If 
<A NAME="617"></A>he desired the business to be completed and the race of those infamous 
<A NAME="618"></A>people to be cut off, more bodies of men must be sent in several directions 
<A NAME="619"></A>and the soldiers must be detached on all sides; if he were disposed to 
<A NAME="620"></A>keep the companies at their standards, as the established discipline and 
<A NAME="621"></A>practice of the Roman army required, the situation itself was a safeguard 
<A NAME="622"></A>to the barbarians, nor was there wanting to individuals the daring to lay 
<A NAME="623"></A>secret ambuscades and beset scattered soldiers. But amid difficulties of 
<A NAME="624"></A>this nature as far as precautions could be taken by vigilance, such precautions 
<A NAME="625"></A>were taken; so that some opportunities of injuring the enemy were neglected, 
<A NAME="626"></A>though the minds of all were burning to take revenge, rather than that 
<A NAME="627"></A>injury should be effected with any loss to our soldiers. Caesar dispatches 
<A NAME="628"></A>messengers to the neighboring states; by the hope of booty he invites all 
<A NAME="629"></A>to him, for the purpose of plundering the Eburones, in order that the life 
<A NAME="630"></A>of the Gauls might be hazarded in the woods rather than the legionary soldiers; 
<A NAME="631"></A>at the same time, in order that a large force being drawn around them, 
<A NAME="632"></A>the race and name of that state may be annihilated for such a crime. A 
<A NAME="633"></A>large number from all quarters speedily assembles.
<A NAME="634"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 35</B>
<A NAME="635"></A><BR><BR>These things were going on in all parts of the territories of the 
<A NAME="636"></A>Eburones, and the seventh day was drawing near, by which day Caesar had 
<A NAME="637"></A>purposed to return to the baggage and the legion. Here it might be learned 
<A NAME="638"></A>how much fortune achieves in war, and how great casualties she produces. 
<A NAME="639"></A>The enemy having been scattered and alarmed, as we related above, there 
<A NAME="640"></A>was no force which might produce even a slight occasion of fear. The report 
<A NAME="641"></A>extends beyond the Rhine to the Germans that the Eburones are being pillaged, 
<A NAME="642"></A>and that all were without distinction invited to the plunder. The Sigambri, 
<A NAME="643"></A>who are nearest to the Rhine, by whom, we have mentioned above, the Tenchtheri 
<A NAME="644"></A>and Usipetes were received after their retreat, collect 2,000 horse; they 
<A NAME="645"></A>cross the Rhine in ships and barks thirty miles below that place where 
<A NAME="646"></A>the bridge was entire and the garrison left by Caesar; they arrive at the 
<A NAME="647"></A>frontiers of the Eburones, surprise many who were scattered in flight, 
<A NAME="648"></A>and get possession of a large amount of cattle, of which barbarians are 
<A NAME="649"></A>extremely covetous. Allured by booty, they advance further; neither morass 
<A NAME="650"></A>nor forest obstructs these men, born amid war and depredations; they inquire 
<A NAME="651"></A>of their prisoners in what part Caesar is; they find that he has advanced 
<A NAME="652"></A>further, and learn that all the army has removed. Thereon one of the prisoners 
<A NAME="653"></A>says, "Why do you pursue such wretched and trifling spoil; you, to whom 
<A NAME="654"></A>it is granted to become even now most richly endowed by fortune? In three 
<A NAME="655"></A>hours you can reach Aduatuca; there the Roman army has deposited all its 
<A NAME="656"></A>fortunes; there is so little of a garrison that not even the wall can be 
<A NAME="657"></A>manned, nor dare any one go beyond the fortifications." A hope having been 
<A NAME="658"></A>presented them, the Germans leave in concealment the plunder they had acquired; 
<A NAME="659"></A>they themselves hasten to Aduatuca, employing as their guide the same man 
<A NAME="660"></A>by whose information they had become informed of these 
<A NAME="661"></A>things.
<A NAME="662"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 36</B>
<A NAME="663"></A><BR><BR>Cicero, who during all the foregoing days had kept his soldiers 
<A NAME="664"></A>in camp with the greatest exactness, and agreeable to the injunctions of 
<A NAME="665"></A>Caesar, had not permitted even any of the camp-followers to go beyond the 
<A NAME="666"></A>fortification, distrusting on the seventh day that Caesar would keep his 
<A NAME="667"></A>promise as to the number of days, because he heard that he had proceeded 
<A NAME="668"></A>further, and no report as to his return was brought to him, and being urged 
<A NAME="669"></A>at the same time by the expressions of those who called his tolerance almost 
<A NAME="670"></A>a siege, if, forsooth, it was not permitted them to go out of the camp, 
<A NAME="671"></A>since he might expect no disaster, whereby he could be injured, within 
<A NAME="672"></A>three miles of the camp, while nine legions and all the cavalry were under 
<A NAME="673"></A>arms, and the enemy scattered and almost annihilated, sent five cohorts 
<A NAME="674"></A>into the neighboring corn-lands, between which and the camp only one hill 
<A NAME="675"></A>intervened, for the purpose of foraging. Many soldiers of the legions had 
<A NAME="676"></A>been left invalided in the camp, of whom those who had recovered in this 
<A NAME="677"></A>space of time, being about 300, are sent together under one standard; a 
<A NAME="678"></A>large number of soldiers' attendants besides, with a great number of beasts 
<A NAME="679"></A>of burden, which had remained in the camp, permission being granted, follow 
<A NAME="680"></A>them.
<A NAME="681"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 37</B>
<A NAME="682"></A><BR><BR>At this very time, the German horse by chance came up, and immediately, 
<A NAME="683"></A>with the same speed with which they had advanced, attempt to force the 
<A NAME="684"></A>camp at the Decuman gate, nor were they seen, in consequence of woods lying 
<A NAME="685"></A>in the way on that side, before they were just reaching the camp: so much 
<A NAME="686"></A>so, that the sutlers who had their booths under the rampart had not an 
<A NAME="687"></A>opportunity of retreating within the camp. Our men, not anticipating it, 
<A NAME="688"></A>are perplexed by the sudden affair, and the cohort on the outpost scarcely 
<A NAME="689"></A>sustains the first attack. The enemy spread themselves on the other sides 
<A NAME="690"></A>to ascertain if they could find any access. Our men with difficulty defend 
<A NAME="691"></A>the gates; the very position of itself and the fortification secures the 
<A NAME="692"></A>other accesses. There is a panic in the entire camp, and one inquires of 
<A NAME="693"></A>another the cause of the confusion, nor do they readily determine whither 
<A NAME="694"></A>the standards should be borne, nor into what quarter each should betake 
<A NAME="695"></A>himself. One avows that the camp is already taken, another maintains that, 
<A NAME="696"></A>the enemy having destroyed the army and commander-in-chief, are come hither 
<A NAME="697"></A>as conquerors; most form strange superstitious fancies from the spot, and 
<A NAME="698"></A>place before their eyes the catastrophe of Cotta and Titurius, who had 
<A NAME="699"></A>fallen in the same fort. All being greatly disconcerted by this alarm, 
<A NAME="700"></A>the belief of the barbarians is strengthened that there is no garrison 
<A NAME="701"></A>within, as they had heard from their prisoner. They endeavor to force an 
<A NAME="702"></A>entrance and encourage one another not to cast from their hands so valuable 
<A NAME="703"></A>a prize.
<A NAME="704"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 38</B>
<A NAME="705"></A><BR><BR><B>P.</B> Sextius Baculus, who had led a principal century under 
<A NAME="706"></A>Caesar (of whom we have made mention in previous engagements), had been 
<A NAME="707"></A>left an invalid in the garrison, and had now been five days without food. 
<A NAME="708"></A>He, distrusting his own safety and that of all, goes forth from his tent 
<A NAME="709"></A>unarmed; he sees that the enemy are close at hand and that the matter is 
<A NAME="710"></A>in the utmost danger; he snatches arms from those nearest, and stations 
<A NAME="711"></A>himself at the gate. The centurions of that cohort which was on guard follow 
<A NAME="712"></A>him; for a short time they sustain the fight together. Sextius faints, 
<A NAME="713"></A>after receiving many wounds; he is with difficulty saved, drawn away by 
<A NAME="714"></A>the hands of the soldiers. This space having intervened, the others resume 
<A NAME="715"></A>courage so far as to venture to take their place on the fortifications 
<A NAME="716"></A>and present the aspect of defenders.
<A NAME="717"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 39</B>
<A NAME="718"></A><BR><BR>The foraging having in the mean time been completed, our soldiers 
<A NAME="719"></A>distinctly hear the shout; the horse hasten on before and discover in what 
<A NAME="720"></A>danger the affair is. But here there is no fortification to receive them, 
<A NAME="721"></A>in their alarm: those last enlisted, and unskilled in military discipline 
<A NAME="722"></A>turn their faces to the military tribune and the centurions; they wait 
<A NAME="723"></A>to find what orders may be given by them. No one is so courageous as not 
<A NAME="724"></A>to be disconcerted by the suddenness of the affair. The barbarians, espying 
<A NAME="725"></A>our standard in the distance, desist from the attack; at first they suppose 
<A NAME="726"></A>that the legions, which they had learned from their prisoners had removed 
<A NAME="727"></A>further off, had returned; afterward, despising their small number, they 
<A NAME="728"></A>make an attack on them at all sides.
<A NAME="729"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 40</B>
<A NAME="730"></A><BR><BR>The camp-followers run forward to the nearest rising ground; being 
<A NAME="731"></A>speedily driven from this they throw themselves among the standards and 
<A NAME="732"></A>companies: they thus so much the more alarm the soldiers already affrighted. 
<A NAME="733"></A>Some propose that, forming a wedge, they suddenly break through, since 
<A NAME="734"></A>the camp was so near; and if any part should be surrounded and slain, they 
<A NAME="735"></A>fully trust that at least the rest may be saved; others, that they take 
<A NAME="736"></A>their stand on an eminence, and all undergo the same destiny. The veteran 
<A NAME="737"></A>soldiers whom we stated to have set out together [with the others] under 
<A NAME="738"></A>a standard, do not approve of this. Therefore encouraging each other, under 
<A NAME="739"></A>the conduct of Caius Trebonius, a Roman knight, who had been appointed 
<A NAME="740"></A>over them, they break through the midst of the enemy, and arrive in the 
<A NAME="741"></A>camp safe to a man. The camp attendants and the horse following close upon 
<A NAME="742"></A>them with the same impetuosity, are saved by the courage of the soldiers. 
<A NAME="743"></A>But those who had taken their stand upon the eminence having even now acquired 
<A NAME="744"></A>no experience of military matters, neither could persevere in that resolution 
<A NAME="745"></A>which they approved of, namely, to defend themselves from their higher 
<A NAME="746"></A>position, nor imitate that vigor and speed which they had observed to have 
<A NAME="747"></A>availed others; but, attempting to reach the camp, had descended into an 
<A NAME="748"></A>unfavorable situation. The centurions, some of whom had been promoted for 
<A NAME="749"></A>their valor from the lower ranks of other legions to higher ranks in this 
<A NAME="750"></A>legion, in order that they might not forfeit their glory for military exploits 
<A NAME="751"></A>previously acquired, fell together fighting most valiantly. The enemy having 
<A NAME="752"></A>been dislodged by their valor, a part of the soldiers arrived safe in camp 
<A NAME="753"></A>contrary to their expectations; a part perished, surrounded by the 
<A NAME="754"></A>barbarians.
<A NAME="755"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 41</B>
<A NAME="756"></A><BR><BR>The Germans, despairing of taking the camp by storm, because they 
<A NAME="757"></A>saw that our men had taken up their position on the fortifications, retreated 
<A NAME="758"></A>beyond the Rhine with that plunder which they had deposited in the woods. 
<A NAME="759"></A>And so great was the alarm, even after the departure of the enemy, that 
<A NAME="760"></A>when C. Volusenus, who had been sent with the cavalry, arrived that night, 
<A NAME="761"></A>he could not gain credence that Caesar was close at hand with his army 
<A NAME="762"></A>safe. Fear had so pre-occupied the minds of all, that their reason being 
<A NAME="763"></A>almost estranged, they said that all the other forces having been cut off, 
<A NAME="764"></A>the cavalry alone had arrived there by flight, and asserted that, if the 
<A NAME="765"></A>army were safe, the Germans would not have attacked the camp; which fear 
<A NAME="766"></A>the arrival of Caesar removed.
<A NAME="767"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 42</B>
<A NAME="768"></A><BR><BR>He, on his return, being well aware of the casualties of war, complained 
<A NAME="769"></A>of one thing [only], namely, that the cohorts had been sent away from the 
<A NAME="770"></A>outposts and garrison [duty], and pointed out that room ought not to have 
<A NAME="771"></A>been left for even the most trivial casualty; that fortune had exercised 
<A NAME="772"></A>great influence in the sudden arrival of their enemy; much greater, in 
<A NAME="773"></A>that she had turned the barbarians away from the very rampart and gates 
<A NAME="774"></A>of the camp. Of all which events, it seemed the most surprising, that the 
<A NAME="775"></A>Germans, who had crossed the Rhine with this object, that they might plunder 
<A NAME="776"></A>the territories of Ambiorix, being led to the camp of the Romans, rendered 
<A NAME="777"></A>Ambiorix a most acceptable service.
<A NAME="778"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 43</B>
<A NAME="779"></A><BR><BR>Caesar, having again marched to harass the enemy, after collecting 
<A NAME="780"></A>a large number [of auxiliaries] from the neighboring states, dispatches 
<A NAME="781"></A>them in all directions. All the villages and all the buildings, which each 
<A NAME="782"></A>beheld, were on fire: spoil was being driven off from all parts; the corn 
<A NAME="783"></A>not only was being consumed by so great numbers of cattle and men, but 
<A NAME="784"></A>also had fallen to the earth, owing to the time of the year and the storms; 
<A NAME="785"></A>so that if any had concealed themselves for the present, still, it appeared 
<A NAME="786"></A>likely that they must perish through want of all things, when the army 
<A NAME="787"></A>should be drawn off. And frequently it came to that point, as so large 
<A NAME="788"></A>a body of cavalry had been sent abroad in all directions, that the prisoners 
<A NAME="789"></A>declared Ambiorix had just then been seen by them in flight, and had not 
<A NAME="790"></A>even passed out of sight, so that the hope of overtaking him being raised, 
<A NAME="791"></A>and unbounded exertions having been resorted to, those who thought they 
<A NAME="792"></A>should acquire the highest favor with Caesar, nearly overcame nature by 
<A NAME="793"></A>their ardor, and continually, a little only seemed wanting to complete 
<A NAME="794"></A>success; but he rescued himself by [means of] lurking-places and forests, 
<A NAME="795"></A>and, concealed by the night made for other districts and quarters, with 
<A NAME="796"></A>no greater guard than that of four horsemen, to whom along he ventured 
<A NAME="797"></A>to confide his life.
<A NAME="798"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 44</B>
<A NAME="799"></A><BR><BR>Having devastated the country in such a manner, Caesar leads back 
<A NAME="800"></A>his army with the loss of two cohorts to Durocortorum of the Remi, and, 
<A NAME="801"></A>having summoned a council of Gaul to assemble at that place, he resolved 
<A NAME="802"></A>to hold an investigation respecting the conspiracy of the Senones and Carnutes, 
<A NAME="803"></A>and having pronounced a most severe sentence upon Acco, who had been the 
<A NAME="804"></A>contriver of that plot, he punished him after the custom of our ancestors. 
<A NAME="805"></A>Some fearing a trial, fled; when he had forbidden these fire and water, 
<A NAME="806"></A>he stationed in winter quarters two legions at the frontiers of the Treviri, 
<A NAME="807"></A>two among the Lingones, the remaining six at Agendicum, in the territories 
<A NAME="808"></A>of the Senones; and, having provided corn for the army, he set out for 
<A NAME="809"></A>Italy, as he had determined, to hold the assizes.
