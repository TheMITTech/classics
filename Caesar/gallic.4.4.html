<A NAME="start"></A>
<A NAME="10"></A><B>Chapter 1</B>
<A NAME="11"></A><BR><BR>The following winter (this was the year in which Cn. Pompey and 
<A NAME="12"></A>M. Crassus were consuls), those Germans [called] the Usipetes, and likewise 
<A NAME="13"></A>the Tenchtheri, with a great number of men, crossed the Rhine, not far 
<A NAME="14"></A>from the place at which that river discharges itself into the sea. The 
<A NAME="15"></A>motive for crossing [that river] was, that having been for several years 
<A NAME="16"></A>harassed by the Suevi, they were constantly engaged in war, and hindered 
<A NAME="17"></A>from the pursuits of agriculture. The nation of the Suevi is by far the 
<A NAME="18"></A>largest and the most warlike nation of all the Germans. They are said to 
<A NAME="19"></A>possess a hundred cantons, from each of which they yearly send from their 
<A NAME="20"></A>territories for the purpose of war a thousand armed men: the others who 
<A NAME="21"></A>remain at home, maintain [both] themselves and those-engaged in the expedition. 
<A NAME="22"></A>The latter again, in their turn, are in arms the year after: the former 
<A NAME="23"></A>remain at home. Thus neither husbandry, nor the art and practice of war 
<A NAME="24"></A>are neglected. But among them there exists no private and separate land; 
<A NAME="25"></A>nor are they permitted to remain more than one year in one place for the 
<A NAME="26"></A>purpose of residence. They do not live much on corn, but subsist for the 
<A NAME="27"></A>most part on milk and flesh, and are much [engaged] in hunting; which circumstance 
<A NAME="28"></A>must, by the nature of their food, and by their daily exercise and the 
<A NAME="29"></A>freedom of their life (for having from boyhood been accustomed to no employment, 
<A NAME="30"></A>or discipline, they do nothing at all contrary to their inclination), both 
<A NAME="31"></A>promote their strength and render them men of vast stature of body. And 
<A NAME="32"></A>to such a habit have they brought themselves, that even in the coldest 
<A NAME="33"></A>parts they wear no clothing whatever except skins, by reason of the scantiness 
<A NAME="34"></A>of which, a great portion of their body is bare, and besides they bathe 
<A NAME="35"></A>in open rivers.
<A NAME="36"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 2</B>
<A NAME="37"></A><BR><BR>Merchants have access to them rather that they may have persons 
<A NAME="38"></A>to whom they may sell those things which they have taken in war, than because 
<A NAME="39"></A>they need any commodity to be imported to them. Moreover, even as to laboring 
<A NAME="40"></A>cattle, in which the Gauls take the greatest pleasure, and which they procure 
<A NAME="41"></A>at a great price, the Germans do not employ such as are imported, but those 
<A NAME="42"></A>poor and ill-shaped animals, which belong to their country; these, however, 
<A NAME="43"></A>they render capable of the greatest labor by daily exercise. In cavalry 
<A NAME="44"></A>actions they frequently leap from their horses and fight on foot; and train 
<A NAME="45"></A>their horses to stand still in the very spot on which they leave them, 
<A NAME="46"></A>to which they retreat with great activity when there is occasion; nor, 
<A NAME="47"></A>according to their practice, is any thing regarded as more unseemly, or 
<A NAME="48"></A>more unmanly, than to use housings. Accordingly, they have the courage, 
<A NAME="49"></A>though they be themselves but few, to advance against any number whatever 
<A NAME="50"></A>of horse mounted with housings. They on no account permit wine to be imported 
<A NAME="51"></A>to them, because they consider that men degenerate in their powers of enduring 
<A NAME="52"></A>fatigue, and are rendered effeminate by that commodity.
<A NAME="53"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 3</B>
<A NAME="54"></A><BR><BR>They esteem it their greatest praise as a nation, that the lands 
<A NAME="55"></A>about their territories lie unoccupied to a very great extent, inasmuch 
<A NAME="56"></A>as [they think] that by this circumstance is indicated, that a great number 
<A NAME="57"></A>of nations can not withstand their power; and thus on one side of the Suevi 
<A NAME="58"></A>the lands are said to lie desolate for about six hundred miles. On the 
<A NAME="59"></A>other side they border on the Ubii, whose state was large and flourishing, 
<A NAME="60"></A>considering the condition of the Germans, and who are somewhat more refined 
<A NAME="61"></A>than those of the same race and the rest [of the Germans], and that because 
<A NAME="62"></A>they border on the Rhine, and are much resorted to by merchants, and are 
<A NAME="63"></A>accustomed to the manners of the Gauls, by reason of their approximity 
<A NAME="64"></A>to them. Though the Suevi, after making the attempt frequently and in several 
<A NAME="65"></A>wars, could not expel this nation from their territories, on account of 
<A NAME="66"></A>the extent and population of their state, yet they made them tributaries, 
<A NAME="67"></A>and rendered them less distinguished and powerful [than they had ever 
<A NAME="68"></A>been].
<A NAME="69"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 4</B>
<A NAME="70"></A><BR><BR>In the same condition were the Usipetes and the Tenchtheri (whom 
<A NAME="71"></A>we have mentioned above), who, for many years, resisted the power of the 
<A NAME="72"></A>Suevi, but being at last driven from their possessions, and having wandered 
<A NAME="73"></A>through many parts of Germany, came to the Rhine, to districts which the 
<A NAME="74"></A>Menapii inhabited, and where they had lands, houses, and villages on either 
<A NAME="75"></A>side of the river. The latter people, alarmed by the arrival of so great 
<A NAME="76"></A>a multitude, removed from those houses which they had on the other side 
<A NAME="77"></A>of the river, and having placed guards on this side the Rhine, proceeded 
<A NAME="78"></A>to hinder the Germans from crossing. They, finding themselves, after they 
<A NAME="79"></A>had tried all means, unable either to force a passage on account of their 
<A NAME="80"></A>deficiency in shipping, or cross by stealth on account of the guards of 
<A NAME="81"></A>the Menapii, pretended to return to their own settlements and districts; 
<A NAME="82"></A>and, after having proceeded three days' march, returned; and their cavalry 
<A NAME="83"></A>having performed the whole of this journey in one night, cut off the Menapii, 
<A NAME="84"></A>who were ignorant of, and did not expect [their approach, and] who, having 
<A NAME="85"></A>moreover been informed of the departure of the Germans by their scouts, 
<A NAME="86"></A>had, without apprehension, returned to their villages beyond the Rhine. 
<A NAME="87"></A>Having slain these, and seized their ships, they crossed the river before 
<A NAME="88"></A>that part of the Menapii, who were at peace in their settlements over the 
<A NAME="89"></A>Rhine, were apprized of [their intention]; and seizing all their houses, 
<A NAME="90"></A>maintained themselves upon their provisions during the rest of the 
<A NAME="91"></A>winter.
<A NAME="92"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 5</B>
<A NAME="93"></A><BR><BR>Caesar, when informed of these matters, fearing the fickle disposition 
<A NAME="94"></A>of the Gauls, who are easily prompted to take up resolutions, and much 
<A NAME="95"></A>addicted to change, considered that nothing was to be intrusted to them; 
<A NAME="96"></A>for it is the custom of that people to compel travelers to stop, even against 
<A NAME="97"></A>their inclination, and inquire what they may have heard, or may know, respecting 
<A NAME="98"></A>any matter; and in towns the common people throng around merchants and 
<A NAME="99"></A>force them to state from what countries they come, and what affairs they 
<A NAME="100"></A>know of there. They often engage in resolutions concerning the most important 
<A NAME="101"></A>matters, induced by these reports and stories alone; of which they must 
<A NAME="102"></A>necessarily instantly repent, since they yield to mere unauthorized reports; 
<A NAME="103"></A>and since most people give to their questions answers framed agreeably 
<A NAME="104"></A>to their wishes.
<A NAME="105"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 6</B>
<A NAME="106"></A><BR><BR>Caesar, being aware of their custom, in order that he might not 
<A NAME="107"></A>encounter a more formidable war, sets forward to the army earlier in the 
<A NAME="108"></A>year than he was accustomed to do. When he had arrived there, he discovered 
<A NAME="109"></A>that those things, which he had suspected would occur, had taken place; 
<A NAME="110"></A>that embassies had been sent to the Germans by some of the states, and 
<A NAME="111"></A>that they had been entreated to leave the Rhine, and had been promised 
<A NAME="112"></A>that all things which they desired should be provided by the Gauls. Allured 
<A NAME="113"></A>by this hope, the Germans were then making excursions to greater distances, 
<A NAME="114"></A>and had advanced to the territories of the Eburones and the Condrusi, who 
<A NAME="115"></A>are under the protection of the Treviri. After summoning the chiefs of 
<A NAME="116"></A>Gaul, Caesar thought proper to pretend ignorance of the things which he 
<A NAME="117"></A>had discovered; and having conciliated and confirmed their minds, and ordered 
<A NAME="118"></A>some cavalry to be raised, resolved to make war against the 
<A NAME="119"></A>Germans.
<A NAME="120"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 7</B>
<A NAME="121"></A><BR><BR>Having provided corn and selected his cavalry, he began to direct 
<A NAME="122"></A>his march toward those parts in which he heard the Germans were. When he 
<A NAME="123"></A>was distant from them only a few days' march, embassadors came to him from 
<A NAME="124"></A>their state, whose speech was as follows: "That the Germans neither make 
<A NAME="125"></A>war upon the Roman people first, nor do they decline, if they are provoked, 
<A NAME="126"></A>to engage with them in arms; for that this was the custom of the Germans 
<A NAME="127"></A>handed down to them from their forefathers, - to resist whatsoever people 
<A NAME="128"></A>make war upon them and not to avert it by entreaty; this, however, they 
<A NAME="129"></A>confessed, - that they had come hither reluctantly, having been expelled 
<A NAME="130"></A>from their country. If the Romans were disposed to accept their friendship, 
<A NAME="131"></A>they might be serviceable allies to them; and let them either assign them 
<A NAME="132"></A>lands, or permit them to retain those which they had acquired by their 
<A NAME="133"></A>arms; that they are inferior to the Suevi alone, to whom not even the immortal 
<A NAME="134"></A>gods can show themselves equal; that there was none at all besides on earth 
<A NAME="135"></A>whom they could not conquer."
<A NAME="136"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 8</B>
<A NAME="137"></A><BR><BR>To these remarks Caesar replied in such terms as he thought proper; 
<A NAME="138"></A>but the conclusion of his speech was, "That he could make no alliance with 
<A NAME="139"></A>them, if they continued in Gaul; that it was not probable that they who 
<A NAME="140"></A>were not able to defend their own territories, should get possession of 
<A NAME="141"></A>those of others, nor were there any lands lying waste in Gaul, which could 
<A NAME="142"></A>be given away, especially to so great a number of men, without doing wrong 
<A NAME="143"></A>[to others]; but they might, if they were desirous, settle in the territories 
<A NAME="144"></A>of the Ubii; whose embassadors were then with him, and were complaining 
<A NAME="145"></A>of the aggressions of the Suevi, and requesting assistance from him; and 
<A NAME="146"></A>that he would obtain this request from them."
<A NAME="147"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 9</B>
<A NAME="148"></A><BR><BR>The embassadors said that they would report these things to their 
<A NAME="149"></A>country men; and, after having deliberated on the matter, would return 
<A NAME="150"></A>to Caesar after the third day, they begged that he would not in the mean 
<A NAME="151"></A>time advance his camp nearer to them. Caesar said that he could not grant 
<A NAME="152"></A>them even that; for he had learned that they had sent a great part of their 
<A NAME="153"></A>cavalry over the Meuse to the Ambivariti, some days before, for the purpose 
<A NAME="154"></A>of plundering and procuring forage. He supposed that they were then waiting 
<A NAME="155"></A>for these horse, and that the delay was caused on this 
<A NAME="156"></A>account.
<A NAME="157"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 10</B>
<A NAME="158"></A><BR><BR>The Meuse rises from mount Le Vosge, which is in the territories 
<A NAME="159"></A>of the Lingones; and, having received a branch of the Rhine, which is called 
<A NAME="160"></A>the Waal, forms the island of the Batavi, and not more than eighty miles 
<A NAME="161"></A>from it it falls into the ocean. But the Rhine takes its source among the 
<A NAME="162"></A>Lepontii, who inhabit the Alps, and is carried with a rapid current for 
<A NAME="163"></A>a long distance through the territories of the Sarunates, Helvetii, Sequani, 
<A NAME="164"></A>Mediomatrici, Tribuci, and Treviri, and when it approaches the ocean, divides 
<A NAME="165"></A>into several branches; and, having formed many and extensive islands, a 
<A NAME="166"></A>great part of which are inhabited by savage and barbarous nations (of whom 
<A NAME="167"></A>there are some who are supposed to live on fish and the eggs of sea-fowl), 
<A NAME="168"></A>flows into the ocean by several mouths.
<A NAME="169"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 11</B>
<A NAME="170"></A><BR><BR>When Caesar was not more than twelve miles distant from the enemy, 
<A NAME="171"></A>the embassadors return to him, as had been arranged; who meeting him on 
<A NAME="172"></A>the march, earnestly entreated him not to advance any further. When they 
<A NAME="173"></A>could not obtain this, they begged him to send on a dispatch to those who 
<A NAME="174"></A>had marched in advance of the main army, and forbid them to engage; and 
<A NAME="175"></A>grant them permission to send embassadors to the Ubii, and if the princes 
<A NAME="176"></A>and senate of the latter would give them security by oath, they assured 
<A NAME="177"></A>Caesar that they would accept such conditions as might be proposed by him; 
<A NAME="178"></A>and requested that he would give them the space of three days for negociating 
<A NAME="179"></A>these affairs. Caesar thought that these things tended to the self-same 
<A NAME="180"></A>point [as their other proposal]; [namely] that, in consequence of a delay 
<A NAME="181"></A>of three days intervening, their horse, which were at a distance, might 
<A NAME="182"></A>return; however, he said, that he would not that day advance further than 
<A NAME="183"></A>four miles for the purpose of procuring water; he ordered that they should 
<A NAME="184"></A>assemble at that place in as large a number as possible, the following 
<A NAME="185"></A>day, that he might inquire into their demands. In the mean time he sends 
<A NAME="186"></A>messengers to the officers who had marched in advance with all the cavalry, 
<A NAME="187"></A>to order them not to provoke the enemy to an engagement, and if they themselves 
<A NAME="188"></A>were assailed, to sustain the attack until he came up with the 
<A NAME="189"></A>army.
<A NAME="190"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 12</B>
<A NAME="191"></A><BR><BR>But the enemy, as soon as they saw our horse, the number of which 
<A NAME="192"></A>was 5000, whereas they themselves had not more than 800 horse, because 
<A NAME="193"></A>those which had gone over the Meuse for the purpose of foraging had not 
<A NAME="194"></A>returned, while our men had no apprehensions, because their embassadors 
<A NAME="195"></A>had gone away from Caesar a little before, and that day had been requested 
<A NAME="196"></A>by them as a period of truce, made an onset on our men, and soon threw 
<A NAME="197"></A>them into disorder. When our men, in their turn, made a stand, they, according 
<A NAME="198"></A>to their practice, leaped from their horses to their feet, and stabbing 
<A NAME="199"></A>our horses in the belly and overthrowing a great many of our men, put the 
<A NAME="200"></A>rest to flight, and drove them forward so much alarmed that they did not 
<A NAME="201"></A>desist from their retreat till they had come in sight of our army. In that 
<A NAME="202"></A>encounter seventy-four of our horse were slain; among them, Piso, an Aquitanian, 
<A NAME="203"></A>a most valiant man, and descended from a very illustrious family; whose 
<A NAME="204"></A>grandfather had held the sovereignty of his state, and had been styled 
<A NAME="205"></A>friend by our senate. He, while he was endeavoring to render assistance 
<A NAME="206"></A>to his brother who was surrounded by the enemy, and whom he rescued from 
<A NAME="207"></A>danger, was himself thrown from his horse, which was wounded under him, 
<A NAME="208"></A>but still opposed [his antagonists] with the greatest intrepidity, as long 
<A NAME="209"></A>as he was able to maintain the conflict. When at length he fell, surrounded 
<A NAME="210"></A>on all sides and after receiving many wounds, and his brother, who had 
<A NAME="211"></A>then retired from the fight, observed it from a distance, he spurred on 
<A NAME="212"></A>his horse, threw himself upon the enemy, and was killed.
<A NAME="213"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 13</B>
<A NAME="214"></A><BR><BR>After this engagement, Caesar considered that neither ought embassadors 
<A NAME="215"></A>to be received to audience, nor conditions be accepted by him from those 
<A NAME="216"></A>who, after having sued for peace by way of stratagem and treachery, had 
<A NAME="217"></A>made war without provocation. And to wait until the enemy's forces were 
<A NAME="218"></A>augmented and their cavalry had returned, he concluded, would be the greatest 
<A NAME="219"></A>madness; and knowing the fickleness of the Gauls, he felt how much influence 
<A NAME="220"></A>the enemy had already acquired among them by this one skirmish. He [therefore] 
<A NAME="221"></A>deemed that no time for concerting measures ought to be afforded them. 
<A NAME="222"></A>After having resolved on those things and communicated his plans to his 
<A NAME="223"></A>lieutenants and quaestor in order that he might not suffer any opportunity 
<A NAME="224"></A>for engaging to escape him, a very seasonable event occurred, namely, that 
<A NAME="225"></A>on the morning of the next day, a large body of Germans, consisting of 
<A NAME="226"></A>their princes and old men, came to the camp to him to practice the same 
<A NAME="227"></A>treachery and dissimulation; but, as they asserted, for the purpose of 
<A NAME="228"></A>acquitting themselves for having engaged in a skirmish the day before, 
<A NAME="229"></A>contrary to what had been agreed and to what indeed, they themselves had 
<A NAME="230"></A>requested; and also if they could by any means obtain a truce by deceiving 
<A NAME="231"></A>him. Caesar, rejoicing that they had fallen into his power, ordered them 
<A NAME="232"></A>to be detained. He then drew all his forces out of the camp, and commanded 
<A NAME="233"></A>the cavalry, because he thought they were intimidated by the late skirmish, 
<A NAME="234"></A>to follow in the rear.
<A NAME="235"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 14</B>
<A NAME="236"></A><BR><BR>Having marshalled his army in three lines, and in a short time 
<A NAME="237"></A>performed a march of eight miles, he arrived at the camp of the enemy before 
<A NAME="238"></A>the Germans could perceive what was going on; who being suddenly alarmed 
<A NAME="239"></A>by all the circumstances, both by the speediness of our arrival and the 
<A NAME="240"></A>absence of their own officers, as time was afforded neither for concerting 
<A NAME="241"></A>measures nor for seizing their arms, are perplexed as to whether it would 
<A NAME="242"></A>be better to lead out their forces against the enemy, or to defend their 
<A NAME="243"></A>camp, or seek their safety by flight. Their consternation being made apparent 
<A NAME="244"></A>by their noise and tumult, our soldiers, excited by the treachery of the 
<A NAME="245"></A>preceding day, rushed into the camp: such of them as could readily get 
<A NAME="246"></A>their arms, for a short time withstood our men, and gave battle among their 
<A NAME="247"></A>carts and baggage wagons; but the rest of the people, [consisting] of boys 
<A NAME="248"></A>and women (for they had left their country and crossed the Rhine with all 
<A NAME="249"></A>their families) began to fly in all directions; in pursuit of whom Caesar 
<A NAME="250"></A>sent the cavalry.
<A NAME="251"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 15</B>
<A NAME="252"></A><BR><BR>The Germans when, upon hearing a noise behind them, [they looked 
<A NAME="253"></A>and] saw that their families were being slain, throwing away their arms 
<A NAME="254"></A>and abandoning their standards, fled out of the camp, and when they had 
<A NAME="255"></A>arrived at the confluence of the Meuse and the Rhine, the survivors despairing 
<A NAME="256"></A>of further escape, as a great number of their countrymen had been killed, 
<A NAME="257"></A>threw themselves into the river and there perished, overcome by fear, fatigue, 
<A NAME="258"></A>and the violence of the stream. Our soldiers, after the alarm of so great 
<A NAME="259"></A>a war, for the number of the enemy amounted to 430,000, returned to their 
<A NAME="260"></A>camp, all safe to a man, very few being even wounded. Caesar granted those 
<A NAME="261"></A>whom he had detained in the camp liberty of departing. They however, dreading 
<A NAME="262"></A>revenge and torture from the Gauls, whose lands they had harassed, said 
<A NAME="263"></A>that they desired to remain with him. Caesar granted them 
<A NAME="264"></A>permission.
<A NAME="265"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 16</B>
<A NAME="266"></A><BR><BR>The German war being finished, Caesar thought it expedient for 
<A NAME="267"></A>him to cross the Rhine, for many reasons; of which this was the most weighty, 
<A NAME="268"></A>that, since he saw the Germans were so easily urged to go into Gaul, he 
<A NAME="269"></A>desired they should have their fears for their own territories, when they 
<A NAME="270"></A>discovered that the army of the Roman people both could and dared pass 
<A NAME="271"></A>the Rhine. There was added also, that portion of the cavalry of the Usipetes 
<A NAME="272"></A>and the Tenchtheri, which I have above related to have crossed the Meuse 
<A NAME="273"></A>for the purpose of plundering and procuring forage, and was not present 
<A NAME="274"></A>at the engagement, had betaken themselves, after the retreat of their countrymen, 
<A NAME="275"></A>across the Rhine into the territories of the Sigambri, and united themselves 
<A NAME="276"></A>to them. When Caesar sent embassadors to them, to demand that they should 
<A NAME="277"></A>give up to him those who had made war against him and against Gaul, they 
<A NAME="278"></A>replied, "That the Rhine bounded the empire of the Roman people; if he 
<A NAME="279"></A>did not think it just for the Germans to pass over into Gaul against his 
<A NAME="280"></A>consent, why did he claim that any thing beyond the Rhine should be subject 
<A NAME="281"></A>to his dominion or power?" The Ubii, also, who alone, out of all the nations 
<A NAME="282"></A>lying beyond the Rhine, had sent embassadors to Caesar, and formed an alliance 
<A NAME="283"></A>and given hostages, earnestly entreated "that he would bring them assistance, 
<A NAME="284"></A>because they were grievously oppressed by the Suevi; or, if he was prevented 
<A NAME="285"></A>from doing so by the business of the commonwealth, he would at least transport 
<A NAME="286"></A>his army over the Rhine; that that would be sufficient for their present 
<A NAME="287"></A>assistance and their hope for the future; that so great was the name and 
<A NAME="288"></A>the reputation of his army, even among the most remote nations of the Germans, 
<A NAME="289"></A>arising from the defeat of Ariovistus and this last battle which was fought, 
<A NAME="290"></A>that they might be safe under the fame and friendship of the Roman people." 
<A NAME="291"></A>They promised a large number of ships for transporting the 
<A NAME="292"></A>army.
<A NAME="293"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 17</B>
<A NAME="294"></A><BR><BR>Caesar, for those reasons which I have mentioned, had resolved 
<A NAME="295"></A>to cross the Rhine; but to cross by ships he neither deemed to be sufficiently 
<A NAME="296"></A>safe, nor considered consistent with his own dignity or that of the Roman 
<A NAME="297"></A>people. Therefore, although the greatest difficulty in forming a bridge 
<A NAME="298"></A>was presented to him, on account of the breadth, rapidity, and depth of 
<A NAME="299"></A>the river, he nevertheless considered that it ought to be attempted by 
<A NAME="300"></A>him, or that his army ought not otherwise to be led over. He devised this 
<A NAME="301"></A>plan of a bridge. He joined together at the distance of two feet, two piles, 
<A NAME="302"></A>each a foot and a half thick, sharpened a little at the lower end, and 
<A NAME="303"></A>proportioned in length, to the depth of the river. After he had, by means 
<A NAME="304"></A>of engines, sunk these into the river, and fixed them at the bottom, and 
<A NAME="305"></A>then driven them in with rammers, not quite perpendicularly, dike a stake, 
<A NAME="306"></A>but bending forward and sloping, so as to incline in the direction of the 
<A NAME="307"></A>current of the river; he also placed two [other piles] opposite to these, 
<A NAME="308"></A>at the distance of forty feet lower down, fastened together in the same 
<A NAME="309"></A>manner, but directed against the force and current of the river. Both these, 
<A NAME="310"></A>moreover, were kept firmly apart by beams two feet thick (the space which 
<A NAME="311"></A>the binding of the piles occupied), laid in at their extremities between 
<A NAME="312"></A>two braces on each side, and in consequence of these being in different 
<A NAME="313"></A>directions and fastened on sides the one opposite to the other, so great 
<A NAME="314"></A>was the strength of the work, and such the arrangement of the materials, 
<A NAME="315"></A>that in proportion as the greater body of water dashed against the bridge, 
<A NAME="316"></A>so much the closer were its parts held fastened together. These beams were 
<A NAME="317"></A>bound together by timber laid over them, in the direction of the length 
<A NAME="318"></A>of the bridge, and were [then] covered over with laths and hurdles; and 
<A NAME="319"></A>in addition to this, piles were driven into the water obliquely, at the 
<A NAME="320"></A>lower side of the bridge, and these, serving as buttresses, and being connected 
<A NAME="321"></A>with every portion of the work, sustained the force of the stream: and 
<A NAME="322"></A>there were others also above the bridge, at a moderate distance; that if 
<A NAME="323"></A>trunks of trees or vessels were floated down the river by the barbarians 
<A NAME="324"></A>for the purpose of destroying the work, the violence of such things might 
<A NAME="325"></A>be diminished by these defenses, and might not injure the 
<A NAME="326"></A>bridge.
<A NAME="327"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 18</B>
<A NAME="328"></A><BR><BR>Within ten days after the timber began to be collected, the whole 
<A NAME="329"></A>work was completed, and the whole army led over. Caesar, leaving a strong 
<A NAME="330"></A>guard at each end of the bridge, hastens into the territories of the Sigambri. 
<A NAME="331"></A>In the mean time, embassadors from several nations come to him, whom, on 
<A NAME="332"></A>their suing for peace and alliance, he answers in a courteous manner, and 
<A NAME="333"></A>orders hostages to be brought to him. But the Sigambri, at the very time 
<A NAME="334"></A>the bridge was begun to be built, made preparations for a flight (by the 
<A NAME="335"></A>advice of such of the Tenchtheri and Usipetes as they had among them), 
<A NAME="336"></A>and quitted their territories, and conveyed away all their possessions, 
<A NAME="337"></A>and concealed themselves in deserts and woods.
<A NAME="338"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 19</B>
<A NAME="339"></A><BR><BR>Caesar, having remained in their territories a few days, and burned 
<A NAME="340"></A>all their villages and houses, and cut down their corn, proceeded into 
<A NAME="341"></A>the territories of the Ubii; and having promised them his assistance, if 
<A NAME="342"></A>they were ever harassed by the Suevi, he learned from them these particulars: 
<A NAME="343"></A>that the Suevi, after they had by means of their scouts found that the 
<A NAME="344"></A>bridge was being built, had called a council, according to their custom, 
<A NAME="345"></A>and sent orders to all parts of their state to remove from the towns and 
<A NAME="346"></A>convey their children, wives, and all their possessions into the woods, 
<A NAME="347"></A>and that all who could bear arms should assemble in one place; that the 
<A NAME="348"></A>place thus chosen was nearly the centre of those regions which the Suevi 
<A NAME="349"></A>possessed; that in this spot they had resolved to await the arrival of 
<A NAME="350"></A>the Romans, and give them battle there. When Caesar discovered this, having 
<A NAME="351"></A>already accomplished all these things on account of which he had resolved 
<A NAME="352"></A>to lead his army over, namely, to strike fear into the Germans, take vengeance 
<A NAME="353"></A>on the Sigambri, and free the Ubii from the invasion of the Suevi, having 
<A NAME="354"></A>spent altogether eighteen days beyond the Rhine, and thinking he had advanced 
<A NAME="355"></A>far enough to serve both honor and interest, he returned into Gaul, and 
<A NAME="356"></A>cut down the bridge.
<A NAME="357"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 20</B>
<A NAME="358"></A><BR><BR>During the short part of summer which remained, Caesar, although 
<A NAME="359"></A>in these countries, as all Gaul lies toward the north, the winters are 
<A NAME="360"></A>early, nevertheless resolved to proceed into Britain, because he discovered 
<A NAME="361"></A>that in almost all the wars with the Gauls succors had been furnished to 
<A NAME="362"></A>our enemy from that country; and even if the time of year should be insufficient 
<A NAME="363"></A>for carrying on the war, yet he thought it would be of great service to 
<A NAME="364"></A>him if he only entered the island, and saw into the character of the people, 
<A NAME="365"></A>and got knowledge of their localities, harbors, and landing-places, all 
<A NAME="366"></A>which were for the most part unknown to the Gauls. For neither does any 
<A NAME="367"></A>one except merchants generally go thither, nor even to them was any portion 
<A NAME="368"></A>of it known, except the sea-coast and those parts which are opposite to 
<A NAME="369"></A>Gaul. Therefore, after having called up to him the merchants from all parts, 
<A NAME="370"></A>he could learn neither what was the size of the island, nor what or how 
<A NAME="371"></A>numerous were the nations which inhabited it, nor what system of war they 
<A NAME="372"></A>followed, nor what customs they used, nor what harbors were convenient 
<A NAME="373"></A>for a great number of large ships.
<A NAME="374"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 21</B>
<A NAME="375"></A><BR><BR>He sends before him Caius Volusenus with a ship of war, to acquire 
<A NAME="376"></A>a knowledge of these particulars before he in person should make a descent 
<A NAME="377"></A>into the island, as he was convinced that this was a judicious measure. 
<A NAME="378"></A>He commissioned him to thoroughly examine into all matters, and then return 
<A NAME="379"></A>to him as soon as possible. He himself proceeds to the Morini with all 
<A NAME="380"></A>his forces. He orders ships from all parts of the neighboring countries, 
<A NAME="381"></A>and the fleet which the preceding summer he had built for the war with 
<A NAME="382"></A>the Veneti, to assemble in this place. In the mean time, his purpose having 
<A NAME="383"></A>been discovered, and reported to the Britons by merchants, embassadors 
<A NAME="384"></A>come to him from several states of the island, to promise that they will 
<A NAME="385"></A>give hostages, and submit to the government of the Roman people. Having 
<A NAME="386"></A>given them an audience, he after promising liberally, and exhorting them 
<A NAME="387"></A>to continue in that purpose, sends them back to their own country, and 
<A NAME="388"></A>[dispatches] with them Commius, whom, upon subduing the Atrebates, he had 
<A NAME="389"></A>created king there, a man whose courage and conduct he esteemed, and who 
<A NAME="390"></A>he thought would be faithful to him, and whose influence ranked highly 
<A NAME="391"></A>in those countries. He orders him to visit as many states as he could, 
<A NAME="392"></A>and persuade them to embrace the protection of the Roman people, and apprize 
<A NAME="393"></A>them that he would shortly come thither. Volusenus, having viewed the localities 
<A NAME="394"></A>as far as means could be afforded one who dared not leave his ship and 
<A NAME="395"></A>trust himself to barbarians, returns to Caesar on the fifth day, and reports 
<A NAME="396"></A>what he had there observed.
<A NAME="397"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 22</B>
<A NAME="398"></A><BR><BR>While Caesar remains in these parts for the purpose of procuring 
<A NAME="399"></A>ships, embassadors come to him from a great portion of the Morini, to plead 
<A NAME="400"></A>their excuse respecting their conduct on the late occasion; alleging that 
<A NAME="401"></A>it was as men uncivilized, and as those who were unacquainted with our 
<A NAME="402"></A>custom, that they had made war upon the Roman people, and promising to 
<A NAME="403"></A>perform what he should command. Caesar, thinking that this had happened 
<A NAME="404"></A>fortunately enough for him, because he neither wished to leave an enemy 
<A NAME="405"></A>behind him, nor had an opportunity for carrying on a war, by reason of 
<A NAME="406"></A>the time of year, nor considered that employment in such trifling matters 
<A NAME="407"></A>was to be preferred to his enterprise on Britain, imposes a large number 
<A NAME="408"></A>of hostages; and when these were brought, he received them to his protection. 
<A NAME="409"></A>Having collected together, and provided about eighty transport ships, as 
<A NAME="410"></A>many as he thought necessary for conveying over two legions, he assigned 
<A NAME="411"></A>such [ships] of war as he had besides to the quaestor, his lieutenants, 
<A NAME="412"></A>and officers of cavalry. There were in addition to these eighteen ships 
<A NAME="413"></A>of burden which were prevented, eight miles from that place, by winds, 
<A NAME="414"></A>from being able to reach the same port. These he distributed among the 
<A NAME="415"></A>horse; the rest of the army, he delivered to Q. Titurius Sabinus and L. 
<A NAME="416"></A>Aurunculeius Cotta, his lieutenants, to lead into the territories of the 
<A NAME="417"></A>Menapii and those cantons of the Morini from which embassadors had not 
<A NAME="418"></A>come to him. He ordered P. Sulpicius Rufus, his lieutenant, to hold possession 
<A NAME="419"></A>of the harbor, with such a garrison as he thought sufficient.
<A NAME="420"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 23</B>
<A NAME="421"></A><BR><BR>These matters being arranged, finding the weather favorable for 
<A NAME="422"></A>his voyage, he set sail about the third watch, and ordered the horse to 
<A NAME="423"></A>march forward to the further port, and there embark and follow him. As 
<A NAME="424"></A>this was performed rather tardily by them, he himself reached Britain with 
<A NAME="425"></A>the first squadron of ships, about the fourth hour of the day, and there 
<A NAME="426"></A>saw the forces of the enemy drawn up in arms on all the hills. The nature 
<A NAME="427"></A>of the place was this: the sea was confined by mountains so close to it 
<A NAME="428"></A>that a dart could be thrown from their summit upon the shore. Considering 
<A NAME="429"></A>this by no means a fit place for disembarking, he remained at anchor till 
<A NAME="430"></A>the ninth hour, for the other ships to arrive there. Having in the mean 
<A NAME="431"></A>time assembled the lieutenants and military tribunes, he told them both 
<A NAME="432"></A>what he had learned from Volusenus, and what he wished to be done; and 
<A NAME="433"></A>enjoined them (as the principle of military matters, and especially as 
<A NAME="434"></A>maritime affairs, which have a precipitate and uncertain action, required) 
<A NAME="435"></A>that all things should be performed by them at a nod and at the instant. 
<A NAME="436"></A>Having dismissed them, meeting both with wind and tide favorable at the 
<A NAME="437"></A>same time, the signal being given and the anchor weighed, he advanced about 
<A NAME="438"></A>seven miles from that place, and stationed his fleet over against an open 
<A NAME="439"></A>and level shore.
<A NAME="440"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 24</B>
<A NAME="441"></A><BR><BR>But the barbarians, upon perceiving the design of the Romans, sent 
<A NAME="442"></A>forward their cavalry and charioteers, a class of warriors of whom it is 
<A NAME="443"></A>their practice to make great use in their battles, and following with the 
<A NAME="444"></A>rest of their forces, endeavored to prevent our men landing. In this was 
<A NAME="445"></A>the greatest difficulty, for the following reasons, namely, because our 
<A NAME="446"></A>ships, on account of their great size, could be stationed only in deep 
<A NAME="447"></A>water; and our soldiers, in places unknown to them, with their hands embarrassed, 
<A NAME="448"></A>oppressed with a large and heavy weight of armor, had at the same time 
<A NAME="449"></A>to leap from the ships, stand amid the waves, and encounter the enemy; 
<A NAME="450"></A>whereas they, either on dry ground, or advancing a little way into the 
<A NAME="451"></A>water, free in all their limbs in places thoroughly known to them, could 
<A NAME="452"></A>confidently throw their weapons and spur on their horses, which were accustomed 
<A NAME="453"></A>to this kind of service. Dismayed by these circumstances and altogether 
<A NAME="454"></A>untrained in this mode of battle, our men did not all exert the same vigor 
<A NAME="455"></A>and eagerness which they had been wont to exert in engagements on dry 
<A NAME="456"></A>ground.
<A NAME="457"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 25</B>
<A NAME="458"></A><BR><BR>When Caesar observed this, he ordered the ships of war, the appearance 
<A NAME="459"></A>of which was somewhat strange to the barbarians and the motion more ready 
<A NAME="460"></A>for service, to be withdrawn a little from the transport vessels, and to 
<A NAME="461"></A>be propelled by their oars, and be stationed toward the open flank of the 
<A NAME="462"></A>enemy, and the enemy to be beaten off and driven away, with slings, arrows, 
<A NAME="463"></A>and engines: which plan was of great service to our men; for the barbarians 
<A NAME="464"></A>being startled by the form of our ships and the motions of our oars and 
<A NAME="465"></A>the nature of our engines, which was strange to them, stopped, and shortly 
<A NAME="466"></A>after retreated a little. And while our men were hesitating [whether they 
<A NAME="467"></A>should advance to the shore], chiefly on account of the depth of the sea, 
<A NAME="468"></A>he who carried the eagle of the tenth legion, after supplicating the gods 
<A NAME="469"></A>that the matter might turn out favorably to the legion, exclaimed, "Leap, 
<A NAME="470"></A>fellow soldiers, unless you wish to betray your eagle to the enemy. I, 
<A NAME="471"></A>for my part, will perform my duty to the commonwealth and my general." 
<A NAME="472"></A>When he had said this with a loud voice, he leaped from the ship and proceeded 
<A NAME="473"></A>to bear the eagle toward the enemy. Then our men, exhorting one another 
<A NAME="474"></A>that so great a disgrace should not be incurred, all leaped from the ship. 
<A NAME="475"></A>When those in the nearest vessels saw them, they speedily followed and 
<A NAME="476"></A>approached the enemy.
<A NAME="477"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 26</B>
<A NAME="478"></A><BR><BR>The battle was maintained vigorously on both sides. Our men, however, 
<A NAME="479"></A>as they could neither keep their ranks, nor get firm footing, nor follow 
<A NAME="480"></A>their standards, and as one from one ship and another from another assembled 
<A NAME="481"></A>around whatever standards they met, were thrown into great confusion. But 
<A NAME="482"></A>the enemy, who were acquainted with all the shallows, when from the shore 
<A NAME="483"></A>they saw any coming from a ship one by one, spurred on their horses, and 
<A NAME="484"></A>attacked them while embarrassed; many surrounded a few, others threw their 
<A NAME="485"></A>weapons upon our collected forces on their exposed flank. When Caesar observed 
<A NAME="486"></A>this, he ordered the boats of the ships of war and the spy sloops to be 
<A NAME="487"></A>filled with soldiers, and sent them up to the succor of those whom he had 
<A NAME="488"></A>observed in distress. Our men, as soon as they made good their footing 
<A NAME="489"></A>on dry ground, and all their comrades had joined them, made an attack upon 
<A NAME="490"></A>the enemy, and put them to flight, but could not pursue them very far, 
<A NAME="491"></A>because the horse had not been able to maintain their course at sea and 
<A NAME="492"></A>reach the island. This alone was wanting to Caesar's accustomed 
<A NAME="493"></A>success.
<A NAME="494"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 27</B>
<A NAME="495"></A><BR><BR>The enemy being thus vanquished in battle, as soon as they recovered 
<A NAME="496"></A>after their flight, instantly sent embassadors to Caesar to negotiate about 
<A NAME="497"></A>peace. They promised to give hostages and perform what he should command. 
<A NAME="498"></A>Together with these embassadors came Commius the Altrebatian, who, as I 
<A NAME="499"></A>have above said, had been sent by Caesar into Britain. Him they had seized 
<A NAME="500"></A>upon when leaving his ship, although in the character of embassador he 
<A NAME="501"></A>bore the general's commission to them, and thrown into chains: then after 
<A NAME="502"></A>the battle was fought, they sent him back, and in suing for peace cast 
<A NAME="503"></A>the blame of that act upon the common people, and entreated that it might 
<A NAME="504"></A>be pardoned on account of their indiscretion. Caesar, complaining, that 
<A NAME="505"></A>after they had sued for peace, and had voluntarily sent embassadors into 
<A NAME="506"></A>the continent for that purpose, they had made war without a reason, said 
<A NAME="507"></A>that he would pardon their indiscretion, and imposed hostages, a part of 
<A NAME="508"></A>whom they gave immediately; the rest they said they would give in a few 
<A NAME="509"></A>days, since they were sent for from remote places. In the mean time they 
<A NAME="510"></A>ordered their people to return to the country parts, and the chiefs assembled 
<A NAME="511"></A>from all quarter, and proceeded to surrender themselves and their states 
<A NAME="512"></A>to Caesar.
<A NAME="513"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 28</B>
<A NAME="514"></A><BR><BR>A peace being established by these proceedings four days after 
<A NAME="515"></A>we had come into Britain, the eighteen ships, to which reference has been 
<A NAME="516"></A>made above, and which conveyed the cavalry, set sail from the upper port 
<A NAME="517"></A>with a gentle gale, when, however, they were approaching Britain and were 
<A NAME="518"></A>seen from the camp, so great a storm suddenly arose that none of them could 
<A NAME="519"></A>maintain their course at sea; and some were taken back to the same port 
<A NAME="520"></A>from which they had started; - others, to their great danger, were driven 
<A NAME="521"></A>to the lower part of the island, nearer to the west; which, however, after 
<A NAME="522"></A>having cast anchor, as they were getting filled with water, put out to 
<A NAME="523"></A>sea through necessity in a stormy night, and made for the 
<A NAME="524"></A>continent.
<A NAME="525"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 29</B>
<A NAME="526"></A><BR><BR>It happened that night to be full moon, which usually occasions 
<A NAME="527"></A>very high tides in that ocean; and that circumstance was unknown to our 
<A NAME="528"></A>men. Thus, at the same time, the tide began to fill the ships of war which 
<A NAME="529"></A>Caesar had provided to convey over his army, and which he had drawn up 
<A NAME="530"></A>on the strand; and the storm began to dash the ships of burden which were 
<A NAME="531"></A>riding at anchor against each other; nor was any means afforded our men 
<A NAME="532"></A>of either managing them or of rendering any service. A great many ships 
<A NAME="533"></A>having been wrecked, inasmuch as the rest, having lost their cables, anchors, 
<A NAME="534"></A>and other tackling, were unfit for sailing, a great confusion, as would 
<A NAME="535"></A>necessarily happen, arose throughout the army; for there were no other 
<A NAME="536"></A>ships in which they could be conveyed back, and all things which are of 
<A NAME="537"></A>service in repairing vessels were wanting, and, corn for the winter had 
<A NAME="538"></A>not been provided in those places, because it was understood by all that 
<A NAME="539"></A>they would certainly winter in Gaul.
<A NAME="540"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 30</B>
<A NAME="541"></A><BR><BR>On discovering these things the chiefs of Britain, who had come 
<A NAME="542"></A>up after the battle was fought to perform those conditions which Caesar 
<A NAME="543"></A>had imposed, held a conference, when they perceived that cavalry, and ships, 
<A NAME="544"></A>and corn were wanting to the Romans, and discovered the small number of 
<A NAME="545"></A>our soldiers from the small extent of the camp (which, too, was on this 
<A NAME="546"></A>account more limited than ordinary, because Caesar had conveyed over his 
<A NAME="547"></A>legions without baggage), and thought that the best plan was to renew the 
<A NAME="548"></A>war, and cut off our men from corn and provisions and protract the affair 
<A NAME="549"></A>till winter; because they felt confident, that, if they were vanquished 
<A NAME="550"></A>or cut off from a return, no one would afterward pass over into Britain 
<A NAME="551"></A>for the purpose of making war. Therefore, again entering into a conspiracy, 
<A NAME="552"></A>they began to depart from the camp by degrees and secretly bring up their 
<A NAME="553"></A>people from the country parts.
<A NAME="554"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 31</B>
<A NAME="555"></A><BR><BR>But Caesar, although he had not as yet discovered their measures, 
<A NAME="556"></A>yet, both from what had occurred to his ships, and from the circumstance 
<A NAME="557"></A>that they had neglected to give the promised hostages, suspected that the 
<A NAME="558"></A>thing would come to pass which really did happen. He therefore provided 
<A NAME="559"></A>remedies against all contingencies; for he daily conveyed corn from the 
<A NAME="560"></A>country parts into the camp, used the timber and brass of such ships as 
<A NAME="561"></A>were most seriously damaged for repairing the rest, and ordered whatever 
<A NAME="562"></A>things besides were necessary for this object to be brought to him from 
<A NAME="563"></A>the continent. And thus, since that business was executed by the soldiers 
<A NAME="564"></A>with the greatest energy, he effected that, after the loss of twelve ships, 
<A NAME="565"></A>a voyage could be made well enough in the rest.
<A NAME="566"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 32</B>
<A NAME="567"></A><BR><BR>While these things are being transacted, one legion had been sent 
<A NAME="568"></A>to forage, according to custom, and no suspicion of war had arisen as yet, 
<A NAME="569"></A>and some of the people remained in the country parts, others went backward 
<A NAME="570"></A>and forward to the camp, they who were on duty at the gates of the camp 
<A NAME="571"></A>reported to Caesar that a greater dust than was usual was seen in that 
<A NAME="572"></A>direction in which the legion had marched. Caesar, suspecting that which 
<A NAME="573"></A>was [really the case], - that some new enterprise was undertaken by the 
<A NAME="574"></A>barbarians, ordered the two cohorts which were on duty, to march into that 
<A NAME="575"></A>quarter with him, and two other cohorts to relieve them on duty; the rest 
<A NAME="576"></A>to be armed and follow him immediately. When he had advanced some little 
<A NAME="577"></A>way from the camp, he saw that his men were overpowered by the enemy and 
<A NAME="578"></A>scarcely able to stand their ground, and that, the legion being crowded 
<A NAME="579"></A>together, weapons were being cast on them from all sides. For as all the 
<A NAME="580"></A>corn was reaped in every part with the exception of one, the enemy, suspecting 
<A NAME="581"></A>that our men would repair to that, had concealed themselves in the woods 
<A NAME="582"></A>during the night. Then attacking them suddenly, scattered as they were, 
<A NAME="583"></A>and when they had laid aside their arms, and were engaged in reaping, they 
<A NAME="584"></A>killed a small number, threw the rest into confusion, and surrounded them 
<A NAME="585"></A>with their cavalry and chariots.
<A NAME="586"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 33</B>
<A NAME="587"></A><BR><BR>Their mode of fighting with their chariots is this: firstly, they 
<A NAME="588"></A>drive about in all directions and throw their weapons and generally break 
<A NAME="589"></A>the ranks of the enemy with the very dread of their horses and the noise 
<A NAME="590"></A>of their wheels; and when they have worked themselves in between the troops 
<A NAME="591"></A>of horse, leap from their chariots and engage on foot. The charioteers 
<A NAME="592"></A>in the mean time withdraw some little distance from the battle, and so 
<A NAME="593"></A>place themselves with the chariots that, if their masters are overpowered 
<A NAME="594"></A>by the number of the enemy, they may have a ready retreat to their own 
<A NAME="595"></A>troops. Thus they display in battle the speed of horse, [together with] 
<A NAME="596"></A>the firmness of infantry; and by daily practice and exercise attain to 
<A NAME="597"></A>such expertness that they are accustomed, even on a declining and steep 
<A NAME="598"></A>place, to check their horses at full speed, and manage and turn them in 
<A NAME="599"></A>an instant and run along the pole, and stand on the yoke, and thence betake 
<A NAME="600"></A>themselves with the greatest celerity to their chariots 
<A NAME="601"></A>again.
<A NAME="602"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 34</B>
<A NAME="603"></A><BR><BR>Under these circumstances, our men being dismayed by the novelty 
<A NAME="604"></A>of this mode of battle, Caesar most seasonably brought assistance; for 
<A NAME="605"></A>upon his arrival the enemy paused, and our men recovered from their fear; 
<A NAME="606"></A>upon which thinking the time unfavorable for provoking the enemy and coming 
<A NAME="607"></A>to an action, he kept himself in his own quarter, and, a short time having 
<A NAME="608"></A>intervened, drew back the legions into the camp. While these things are 
<A NAME="609"></A>going on, and all our men engaged, the rest of the Britons, who were in 
<A NAME="610"></A>the fields, departed. Storms then set in for several successive days, which 
<A NAME="611"></A>both confined our men to the camp and hindered the enemy from attacking 
<A NAME="612"></A>us. In the mean time the barbarians dispatched messengers to all parts, 
<A NAME="613"></A>and reported to their people the small number of our soldiers, and how 
<A NAME="614"></A>good an opportunity was given for obtaining spoil and for liberating themselves 
<A NAME="615"></A>forever, if they should only drive the Romans from their camp. Having by 
<A NAME="616"></A>these means speedily got together a large force of infantry and of cavalry 
<A NAME="617"></A>they came up to the camp.
<A NAME="618"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 35</B>
<A NAME="619"></A><BR><BR>Although Caesar anticipated that the same thing which had happened 
<A NAME="620"></A>on former occasions would then occur - that, if the enemy were routed, 
<A NAME="621"></A>they would escape from danger by their speed; still, having got about thirty 
<A NAME="622"></A>horse, which Commius the Atrebatian, of whom mention has been made, had 
<A NAME="623"></A>brought over with him [from Gaul], he drew up the legions in order of battle 
<A NAME="624"></A>before the camp. When the action commenced, the enemy were unable to sustain 
<A NAME="625"></A>the attack of our men long, and turned their backs; our men pursued them 
<A NAME="626"></A>as far as their speed and strength permitted, and slew a great number of 
<A NAME="627"></A>them; then, having destroyed and burned every thing far and wide, they 
<A NAME="628"></A>retreated to their camp.
<A NAME="629"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 36</B>
<A NAME="630"></A><BR><BR>The same day, embassadors sent by the enemy came to Caesar to negotiate 
<A NAME="631"></A>a peace. Caesar doubled the number of hostages which he had before demanded; 
<A NAME="632"></A>and ordered that they should be brought over to the continent, because, 
<A NAME="633"></A>since the time of the equinox was near, he did not consider that, with 
<A NAME="634"></A>his ships out of repair, the voyage ought to be deferred till winter. Having 
<A NAME="635"></A>met with favorable weather, he set sail a little after midnight, and all 
<A NAME="636"></A>his fleet arrived safe at the continent, except two of the ships of burden 
<A NAME="637"></A>which could not make the same port which the other ships did, and were 
<A NAME="638"></A>carried a little lower down.
<A NAME="639"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 37</B>
<A NAME="640"></A><BR><BR>When our soldiers, about 300 in number, had been drawn out of these 
<A NAME="641"></A>two ships, and were marching to the camp, the Morini, whom Caesar, when 
<A NAME="642"></A>setting forth for Britain, had left in a state of peace, excited by the 
<A NAME="643"></A>hope of spoil, at first surrounded them with a small number of men, and 
<A NAME="644"></A>ordered them to lay down their arms, if they did not wish to be slain; 
<A NAME="645"></A>afterward however, when they, forming a circle, stood on their defense, 
<A NAME="646"></A>a shout was raised and about 6000 of the enemy soon assembled; which being 
<A NAME="647"></A>reported, Caesar sent all the cavalry in the camp as a relief to his men. 
<A NAME="648"></A>In the mean time our soldiers sustained the attack of the enemy, and fought 
<A NAME="649"></A>most valiantly for more than four hours, and, receiving but few wounds 
<A NAME="650"></A>themselves, slew several of them. But after our cavalry came in sight, 
<A NAME="651"></A>the enemy, throwing away their arms, turned their backs, and a great number 
<A NAME="652"></A>of them were killed.
<A NAME="653"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 38</B>
<A NAME="654"></A><BR><BR>The day following Caesar sent Labienus, his lieutenant, with those 
<A NAME="655"></A>legions which he had brought back from Britain, against the Morini, who 
<A NAME="656"></A>had revolted; who, as they had no place to which they might retreat, on 
<A NAME="657"></A>account of the drying up of their marshes (which they had availed themselves 
<A NAME="658"></A>of as a place of refuge the preceding year), almost all fell into the power 
<A NAME="659"></A>of Labienus. In the mean time Caesar's lieutenants, Q. Titurius and L. 
<A NAME="660"></A>Cotta, who had led the legions into the territories of the Menapii, having 
<A NAME="661"></A>laid waste all their lands, cut down their corn and burned their houses, 
<A NAME="662"></A>returned to Caesar because the Menapii had all concealed themselves in 
<A NAME="663"></A>their thickest woods. Caesar fixed the winter quarters of all the legions 
<A NAME="664"></A>among the Belgae. Thither only two British states sent hostages; the rest 
<A NAME="665"></A>omitted to do so. For these successes, a thanksgiving of twenty days was 
<A NAME="666"></A>decreed by the senate upon receiving Caesar's letter.
