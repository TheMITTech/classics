<A NAME="start"></A>
<A NAME="10"></A><B>Chapter 1</B>
<A NAME="11"></A><BR><BR>When Caesar was setting out for Italy, he sent Servius Galba with 
<A NAME="12"></A>the twelfth legion and part of the cavalry, against the Nantuates, the 
<A NAME="13"></A>Veragri, and Seduni, who extend from the territories of the Allobroges, 
<A NAME="14"></A>and the lake of Geneva, and the River Rhone to the top of the Alps. The 
<A NAME="15"></A>reason for sending him was, that he desired that the pass along the Alps, 
<A NAME="16"></A>through which [the Roman] merchants had been accustomed to travel with 
<A NAME="17"></A>great danger, and under great imposts, should be opened. He permitted him, 
<A NAME="18"></A>if he thought it necessary, to station the legion in these places, for 
<A NAME="19"></A>the purpose of wintering. Galba having fought some successful battles and 
<A NAME="20"></A>stormed several of their forts, upon embassadors being sent to him from 
<A NAME="21"></A>all parts and hostages given and a peace concluded, determined to station 
<A NAME="22"></A>two cohorts among the Nantuates, and to winter in person with the other 
<A NAME="23"></A>cohorts of that legion in a village of the Veragri, which is called Octodurus; 
<A NAME="24"></A>and this village being situated in a valley, with a small plain annexed 
<A NAME="25"></A>to it, is bounded on all sides by very high mountains. As this village 
<A NAME="26"></A>was divided into two parts by a river, he granted one part of it to the 
<A NAME="27"></A>Gauls, and assigned the other, which had been left by them unoccupied, 
<A NAME="28"></A>to the cohorts to winter in. He fortified this [latter] part with a rampart 
<A NAME="29"></A>and a ditch.
<A NAME="30"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 2</B>
<A NAME="31"></A><BR><BR>When several days had elapsed in winter quarters, and he had ordered 
<A NAME="32"></A>corn to be brought in he was suddenly informed by his scouts that all the 
<A NAME="33"></A>people had gone off in the night from that part of the town which he had 
<A NAME="34"></A>given up to the Gauls, and that the mountains which hung over it were occupied 
<A NAME="35"></A>by a very large force of the Seduni and Veragri. It had happened for several 
<A NAME="36"></A>reasons that the Gauls suddenly formed the design of renewing the war and 
<A NAME="37"></A>cutting off that legion. First, because they despised a single legion, 
<A NAME="38"></A>on account of its small number, and that not quite full (two cohorts having 
<A NAME="39"></A>been detached, and several individuals being absent, who had been dispatched 
<A NAME="40"></A>for the purpose of seeking provision); then, likewise, because they thought 
<A NAME="41"></A>that on account of the disadvantageous character of the situation, even 
<A NAME="42"></A>their first attack could not be sustained [by us] when they would rush 
<A NAME="43"></A>from the mountains into the valley, and discharge their weapons upon us. 
<A NAME="44"></A>To this was added, that they were indignant that their children were torn 
<A NAME="45"></A>from them under the title of hostages, and they were persuaded that the 
<A NAME="46"></A>Romans designed to seize upon the summits of the Alps, and unite those 
<A NAME="47"></A>parts to the neighboring province [of Gaul], not only to secure the passes, 
<A NAME="48"></A>but also a constant possession.
<A NAME="49"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 3</B>
<A NAME="50"></A><BR><BR>Having received these tidings, Galba, since the works of the winter-quarters 
<A NAME="51"></A>and the fortifications were not fully completed, nor was sufficient preparation 
<A NAME="52"></A>made with regard to corn and other provisions (since, as a surrender had 
<A NAME="53"></A>been made, and hostages received, he had thought he need entertain no apprehension 
<A NAME="54"></A>of war), speedily summoning a council, began to anxiously inquire their 
<A NAME="55"></A>opinions. In which council, since so much sudden danger had happened contrary 
<A NAME="56"></A>to the general expectation, and almost all the higher places were seen 
<A NAME="57"></A>already covered with a multitude of armed men, nor could [either] troops 
<A NAME="58"></A>come to their relief, or provisions be brought in, as the passes were blocked 
<A NAME="59"></A>up [by the enemy]; safety being now nearly despaired of, some opinions 
<A NAME="60"></A>of this sort were delivered: that, "leaving their baggage, and making a 
<A NAME="61"></A>sally, they should hasten away for safety by the same routes by which they 
<A NAME="62"></A>had come thither." To the greater part, however, it seemed best, reserving 
<A NAME="63"></A>that measure to the last, to await the issue of the matter, and to defend 
<A NAME="64"></A>the camp.
<A NAME="65"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 4</B>
<A NAME="66"></A><BR><BR>A short time only having elapsed, so that time was scarcely given 
<A NAME="67"></A>for arranging and executing those things which they had determined on, 
<A NAME="68"></A>the enemy, upon the signal being given, rushed down [upon our men] from 
<A NAME="69"></A>all parts, and discharged stones and darts, upon our rampart. Our men at 
<A NAME="70"></A>first, while their strength was fresh, resisted bravely, nor did they cast 
<A NAME="71"></A>any weapon ineffectually from their higher station. As soon as any part 
<A NAME="72"></A>of the camp, being destitute of defenders, seemed to be hard pressed, thither 
<A NAME="73"></A>they ran, and brought assistance. But they were over-matched in this, that 
<A NAME="74"></A>the enemy when wearied by the long continuance of the battle, went out 
<A NAME="75"></A>of the action, and others with fresh strength came in their place; none 
<A NAME="76"></A>of which things could be done by our men, owing to the smallness of their 
<A NAME="77"></A>number; and not only was permission not given to the wearied [Roman] to 
<A NAME="78"></A>retire from the fight, but not even to the wounded [was liberty granted] 
<A NAME="79"></A>to quit the post where he had been stationed, and recover.
<A NAME="80"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 5</B>
<A NAME="81"></A><BR><BR>When they had now been fighting for more than six hours, without 
<A NAME="82"></A>cessation, and not only strength, but even weapons were failing our men, 
<A NAME="83"></A>and the enemy were pressing on more rigorously, and had begun to demolish 
<A NAME="84"></A>the rampart and to fill up the trench, while our men were becoming exhausted, 
<A NAME="85"></A>and the matter was now brought to the last extremity, P. Sextius Baculus, 
<A NAME="86"></A>a centurion of the first rank, whom we have related to have been disabled 
<A NAME="87"></A>by severe wounds in the engagement with the Nervii, and also C. Volusenus, 
<A NAME="88"></A>a tribune of the soldiers, a man of great skill and valor, hasten to Galba, 
<A NAME="89"></A>and assure him that the only hope of safety lay in making a sally, and 
<A NAME="90"></A>trying the last resource. Whereupon assembling the centurions, he quickly 
<A NAME="91"></A>gives orders to the soldiers to discontinue the fight a short time, and 
<A NAME="92"></A>only collect the weapons flung [at them], and recruit themselves after 
<A NAME="93"></A>their fatigue, and afterward, upon the signal being given, sally forth 
<A NAME="94"></A>from the camp, and place in their valor all their hope of 
<A NAME="95"></A>safety.
<A NAME="96"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 6</B>
<A NAME="97"></A><BR><BR>They do what they were ordered; and, making a sudden sally from 
<A NAME="98"></A>all the gates [of the camp], leave the enemy the means neither of knowing 
<A NAME="99"></A>what was taking place, nor of collecting themselves. Fortune thus taking 
<A NAME="100"></A>a turn, [our men] surround on every side, and slay those who had entertained 
<A NAME="101"></A>the hope of gaining the camp and having killed more than the third part 
<A NAME="102"></A>of an army of more than 30,000 men (which number of the barbarians it appeared 
<A NAME="103"></A>certain had come up to our camp), put to flight the rest when panic-stricken, 
<A NAME="104"></A>and do not suffer them to halt even upon the higher grounds. All the forces 
<A NAME="105"></A>of the enemy being thus routed, and stripped of their arms, [our men] betake 
<A NAME="106"></A>themselves to their camp and fortifications. Which battle being finished, 
<A NAME="107"></A>inasmuch as Galba was unwilling to tempt fortune again, and remembered 
<A NAME="108"></A>that he had come into winter quarters with one design, and saw that he 
<A NAME="109"></A>had met with a different state of affairs; chiefly however urged by the 
<A NAME="110"></A>want of corn and provision, having the next day burned all the buildings 
<A NAME="111"></A>of that village, he hastens to return into the province; and as no enemy 
<A NAME="112"></A>opposed or hindered his march, he brought the legion safe into the [country 
<A NAME="113"></A>of the] Nantuates, thence into [that of] the Allobroges, and there 
<A NAME="114"></A>wintered.
<A NAME="115"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 7</B>
<A NAME="116"></A><BR><BR>These things being achieved, while Caesar had every reason to suppose 
<A NAME="117"></A>that Gaul was reduced to a state of tranquillity, the Belgae being overcome, 
<A NAME="118"></A>the Germans expelled, the Seduni among the Alps defeated, and when he had, 
<A NAME="119"></A>therefore, in the beginning of winter, set out for Illyricum, as he wished 
<A NAME="120"></A>to visit those nations, and acquire a knowledge of their countries, a sudden 
<A NAME="121"></A>war sprang up in Gaul. The occasion of that war was this: P. Crassus, a 
<A NAME="122"></A>young man, had taken up his winter quarters with the seventh legion among 
<A NAME="123"></A>the Andes, who border upon the [Atlantic] ocean. He, as there was a scarcity 
<A NAME="124"></A>of corn in those parts, sent out some officers of cavalry, and several 
<A NAME="125"></A>military tribunes among the neighbouring states, for the purpose of procuring 
<A NAME="126"></A>corn and provision; in which number T. Terrasidius was sent among the Esubii; 
<A NAME="127"></A>M. Trebius Gallus among the Curiosolitae; Q. Velanius, T. Silius, amongst 
<A NAME="128"></A>the Veneti.
<A NAME="129"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 8</B>
<A NAME="130"></A><BR><BR>The influence of this state is by far the most considerable of 
<A NAME="131"></A>any of the countries on the whole sea coast, because the Veneti both have 
<A NAME="132"></A>a very great number of ships, with which they have been accustomed to sail 
<A NAME="133"></A>to Britain, and [thus] excel the rest in their knowledge and experience 
<A NAME="134"></A>of nautical affairs; and as only a few ports lie scattered along that stormy 
<A NAME="135"></A>and open sea, of which they are in possession, they hold as tributaries 
<A NAME="136"></A>almost all those who are accustomed to traffic in that sea. With them arose 
<A NAME="137"></A>the beginning [of the revolt] by their detaining Silius and Velanius; for 
<A NAME="138"></A>they thought that they should recover by their means the hostages which 
<A NAME="139"></A>they had given to Crassus. The neighboring people led on by their influence 
<A NAME="140"></A>(as the measures of the Gauls are sudden and hasty), detain Trebius and 
<A NAME="141"></A>Terrasidius for the same motive; and quickly sending embassadors, by means 
<A NAME="142"></A>of their leading men, they enter into a mutual compact to do nothing except 
<A NAME="143"></A>by general consent, and abide the same issue of fortune; and they solicit 
<A NAME="144"></A>the other states to choose rather to continue in that liberty which they 
<A NAME="145"></A>had received from their ancestors, than endure slavery under the Romans. 
<A NAME="146"></A>All the sea coast being quickly brought over to their sentiments, they 
<A NAME="147"></A>send a common embassy to P. Crassus [to say], "If he wished to receive 
<A NAME="148"></A>back his officers, let him send back to them their hostages."
<A NAME="149"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 9</B>
<A NAME="150"></A><BR><BR>Caesar, being informed of these things by Crassus, since he was 
<A NAME="151"></A>so far distant himself, orders ships of war to be built in the mean time 
<A NAME="152"></A>on the river Loire, which flows into the ocean; rowers to be raised from 
<A NAME="153"></A>the province; sailors and pilots to be provided. These matters being quickly 
<A NAME="154"></A>executed, he himself, as soon as the season of the year permits, hastens 
<A NAME="155"></A>to the army. The Veneti, and the other states also, being informed of Caesar's 
<A NAME="156"></A>arrival, when they reflected how great a crime they had committed, in that, 
<A NAME="157"></A>the embassadors (a character which had among all nations ever been sacred 
<A NAME="158"></A>and inviolable) had by them been detained and thrown into prison, resolve 
<A NAME="159"></A>to prepare for a war in proportion to the greatness of their danger, and 
<A NAME="160"></A>especially to provide those things which appertain to the service of a 
<A NAME="161"></A>navy, with the greater confidence, inasmuch as they greatly relied on the 
<A NAME="162"></A>nature of their situation. They knew that the passes by land were cut off 
<A NAME="163"></A>by estuaries, that the approach by sea was most difficult, by reason of 
<A NAME="164"></A>our ignorance of the localities, [and] the small number of the harbors, 
<A NAME="165"></A>and they trusted that our army would not be able to stay very long among 
<A NAME="166"></A>them, on account of the insufficiency of corn; and again, even if all these 
<A NAME="167"></A>things should turn out contrary to their expectation, yet they were very 
<A NAME="168"></A>powerful in their navy. They well understood that the Romans neither had 
<A NAME="169"></A>any number of ships, nor were acquainted with the shallows, the harbors, 
<A NAME="170"></A>or the islands of those parts where they would have to carry on the war; 
<A NAME="171"></A>and the navigation was very different in a narrow sea from what it was 
<A NAME="172"></A>in the vast and open ocean. Having come to this resolution, they fortify 
<A NAME="173"></A>their towns, convey corn into them from the country parts, bring together 
<A NAME="174"></A>as many ships as possible to Venetia, where it appeared Caesar would at 
<A NAME="175"></A>first carry on the war. They unite to themselves as allies for that war, 
<A NAME="176"></A>the Osismii, the Lexovii, the Nannetes, the Ambiliati, the Morini, the 
<A NAME="177"></A>Diablintes, and the Menapii; and send for auxiliaries from Britain, which 
<A NAME="178"></A>is situated over against those regions.
<A NAME="179"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 10</B>
<A NAME="180"></A><BR><BR>There were these difficulties which we have mentioned above, in 
<A NAME="181"></A>carrying on the war, but many things, nevertheless, urged Caesar to that 
<A NAME="182"></A>war; - the open insult offered to the state in the detention of the Roman 
<A NAME="183"></A>knights, the rebellion raised after surrendering, the revolt after hostages 
<A NAME="184"></A>were given, the confederacy of so many states, but principally, lest if, 
<A NAME="185"></A>[the conduct of] this part was overlooked, the other nations should think 
<A NAME="186"></A>that the same thing was permitted them. Wherefore, since he reflected that 
<A NAME="187"></A>almost all the Gauls were fond of revolution, and easily and quickly excited 
<A NAME="188"></A>to war; that all men likewise, by nature, love liberty and hate the condition 
<A NAME="189"></A>of slavery, he thought he ought to divide and more widely distribute his 
<A NAME="190"></A>army, before more states should join the confederation.
<A NAME="191"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 11</B>
<A NAME="192"></A><BR><BR>He therefore sends T. Labienus, his lieutenant, with the cavalry 
<A NAME="193"></A>to the Treviri, who are nearest to the river Rhine. He charges him to visit 
<A NAME="194"></A>the Remi and the other Belgians, and to keep them in their allegiance and 
<A NAME="195"></A>repel the Germans (who were said to have been summoned by the Belgae to 
<A NAME="196"></A>their aid,) if they attempted to cross the river by force in their ships. 
<A NAME="197"></A>He orders P. Crassus to proceed into Aquitania with twelve legionary cohorts 
<A NAME="198"></A>and a great number of the cavalry, lest auxiliaries should be sent into 
<A NAME="199"></A>Gaul by these states, and such great nations be united. He sends Q. Titurius 
<A NAME="200"></A>Sabinus his lieutenant, with three legions, among the Unelli, the Curiosolitae, 
<A NAME="201"></A>and the Lexovii, to take care that their forces should be kept separate 
<A NAME="202"></A>from the rest. He appoints D. Brutus, a young man, over the fleet and those 
<A NAME="203"></A>Gallic vessels which he had ordered to be furnished by the Pictones and 
<A NAME="204"></A>the Santoni, and the other provinces which remained at peace; and commands 
<A NAME="205"></A>him to proceed toward the Veneti, as soon as he could. He himself hastens 
<A NAME="206"></A>thither with the land forces.
<A NAME="207"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 12</B>
<A NAME="208"></A><BR><BR>The sites of their towns were generally such that, being placed 
<A NAME="209"></A>on extreme points [of land] and on promontories, they neither had an approach 
<A NAME="210"></A>by land when the tide had rushed in from the main ocean, which always happens 
<A NAME="211"></A>twice in the space of twelve hours; nor by ships, because, upon the tide 
<A NAME="212"></A>ebbing again, the ships were likely to be dashed upon the shoals. Thus, 
<A NAME="213"></A>by either circumstance, was the storming of their towns rendered difficult; 
<A NAME="214"></A>and if at any time perchance the Veneti overpowered by the greatness of 
<A NAME="215"></A>our works, (the sea having been excluded by a mound and large dams, and 
<A NAME="216"></A>the latter being made almost equal in height to the walls of the town) 
<A NAME="217"></A>had begun to despair of their fortunes; bringing up a large number of ships, 
<A NAME="218"></A>of which they had a very great quantity, they carried off all their property 
<A NAME="219"></A>and betook themselves to the nearest towns; there they again defended themselves 
<A NAME="220"></A>by the same advantages of situation. They did this the more easily during 
<A NAME="221"></A>a great part of the summer, because our ships were kept back by storms, 
<A NAME="222"></A>and the difficulty of sailing was very great in that vast and open sea, 
<A NAME="223"></A>with its strong tides and its harbors far apart and exceedingly few in 
<A NAME="224"></A>number.
<A NAME="225"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 13</B>
<A NAME="226"></A><BR><BR>For their ships were built and equipped after this manner. The 
<A NAME="227"></A>keels were somewhat flatter than those of our ships, whereby they could 
<A NAME="228"></A>more easily encounter the shallows and the ebbing of the tide: the prows 
<A NAME="229"></A>were raised very high, and, in like manner the sterns were adapted to the 
<A NAME="230"></A>force of the waves and storms [which they were formed to sustain]. The 
<A NAME="231"></A>ships were built wholly of oak, and designed to endure any force and violence 
<A NAME="232"></A>whatever; the benches which were made of planks a foot in breadth, were 
<A NAME="233"></A>fastened by iron spikes of the thickness of a man's thumb; the anchors 
<A NAME="234"></A>were secured fast by iron chains instead of cables, and for sails they 
<A NAME="235"></A>used skins and thin dressed leather. These [were used] either through their 
<A NAME="236"></A>want of canvas and their ignorance of its application, or for this reason, 
<A NAME="237"></A>which is more probable, that they thought that such storms of the ocean, 
<A NAME="238"></A>and such violent gales of wind could not be resisted by sails, nor ships 
<A NAME="239"></A>of such great burden be conveniently enough managed by them. The encounter 
<A NAME="240"></A>of our fleet with these ships' was of such a nature that our fleet excelled 
<A NAME="241"></A>in speed alone, and the plying of the oars; other things, considering the 
<A NAME="242"></A>nature of the place [and] the violence of the storms, were more suitable 
<A NAME="243"></A>and better adapted on their side; for neither could our ships injure theirs 
<A NAME="244"></A>with their beaks (so great was their strength), nor on account of their 
<A NAME="245"></A>height was a weapon easily cast up to them; and for the same reason they 
<A NAME="246"></A>were less readily locked in by rocks. To this was added, that whenever 
<A NAME="247"></A>a storm began to rage and they ran before the wind, they both could weather 
<A NAME="248"></A>the storm more easily and heave to securely in the shallows, and when left 
<A NAME="249"></A>by the tide feared nothing from rocks and shelves: the risk of all which 
<A NAME="250"></A>things was much to be dreaded by our ships.
<A NAME="251"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 14</B>
<A NAME="252"></A><BR><BR>Caesar, after taking many of their towns, perceiving that so much 
<A NAME="253"></A>labor was spent in vain and that the flight of the enemy could not be prevented 
<A NAME="254"></A>on the capture of their towns, and that injury could not be done them, 
<A NAME="255"></A>he determined to wait for his fleet. As soon as it came up and was first 
<A NAME="256"></A>seen by the enemy, about 220 of their ships, fully equipped and appointed 
<A NAME="257"></A>with every kind of [naval] implement, sailed forth from the harbor, and 
<A NAME="258"></A>drew up opposite to ours; nor did it appear clear to Brutus, who commanded 
<A NAME="259"></A>the fleet, or to the tribunes of the soldiers and the centurions, to whom 
<A NAME="260"></A>the several ships were assigned, what to do, or what system of tactics 
<A NAME="261"></A>to adopt; for they knew that damage could not be done by their beaks; and 
<A NAME="262"></A>that, although turrets were built [on their decks], yet the height of the 
<A NAME="263"></A>stems of the barbarian ships exceeded these; so that weapons could not 
<A NAME="264"></A>be cast up from [our] lower position with sufficient effect, and those 
<A NAME="265"></A>cast by the Gauls fell the more forcibly upon us. One thing provided by 
<A NAME="266"></A>our men was of great service, [viz.] sharp hooks inserted into and fastened 
<A NAME="267"></A>upon poles, of a form not unlike the hooks used in attacking town walls. 
<A NAME="268"></A>When the ropes which fastened the sail-yards to the masts were caught by 
<A NAME="269"></A>them and pulled, and our vessel vigorously impelled with the oars, they 
<A NAME="270"></A>[the ropes] were severed; and when they were cut away, the yards necessarily 
<A NAME="271"></A>fell down; so that as all the hope of the Gallic vessels depended on their 
<A NAME="272"></A>sails and rigging, upon these being cut away, the entire management of 
<A NAME="273"></A>the ships was taken from them at the same time. The rest of the contest 
<A NAME="274"></A>depended on courage; in which our men decidedly had the advantage; and 
<A NAME="275"></A>the more so, because the whole action was carried on in the sight of Caesar 
<A NAME="276"></A>and the entire army; so that no act, a little more valiant than ordinary, 
<A NAME="277"></A>could pass unobserved, for all the hills and higher grounds, from which 
<A NAME="278"></A>there was a near prospect of the sea were occupied by our 
<A NAME="279"></A>army.
<A NAME="280"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 15</B>
<A NAME="281"></A><BR><BR>The sail yards [of the enemy], as we have said, being brought down, 
<A NAME="282"></A>although two and [in some cases] three ships [of theirs] surrounded each 
<A NAME="283"></A>one [of ours], the soldiers strove with the greatest energy to board the 
<A NAME="284"></A>ships of the enemy; and, after the barbarians observed this taking place, 
<A NAME="285"></A>as a great many of their ships were beaten, and as no relief for that evil 
<A NAME="286"></A>could be discovered, they hastened to seek safety in flight. And, having 
<A NAME="287"></A>now turned their vessels to that quarter in which the wind blew, so great 
<A NAME="288"></A>a calm and lull suddenly arose, that they could not move out of their place, 
<A NAME="289"></A>which circumstance, truly, was exceedingly opportune for finishing the 
<A NAME="290"></A>business; for our men gave chase and took them one by one, so that very 
<A NAME="291"></A>few out of all the number, [and those] by the intervention of night, arrived 
<A NAME="292"></A>at the land, after the battle had lasted almost from the fourth hour till 
<A NAME="293"></A>sun-set.
<A NAME="294"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 16</B>
<A NAME="295"></A><BR><BR>By this battle the war with the Veneti and the whole of the sea 
<A NAME="296"></A>coast was finished; for both all the youth, and all, too, of more advanced 
<A NAME="297"></A>age, in whom there was any discretion or rank, had assembled in that battle; 
<A NAME="298"></A>and they had collected in that one place whatever naval forces they had 
<A NAME="299"></A>anywhere; and when these were lost, the survivors had no place to retreat 
<A NAME="300"></A>to, nor means of defending their towns. They accordingly surrendered themselves 
<A NAME="301"></A>and all their possessions to Caesar, on whom Caesar thought that punishment 
<A NAME="302"></A>should be inflicted the more severely, in order that for the future the 
<A NAME="303"></A>rights of embassadors might be more carefully respected by barbarians; 
<A NAME="304"></A>having, therefore, put to death all their senate, he sold the rest for 
<A NAME="305"></A>slaves.
<A NAME="306"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 17</B>
<A NAME="307"></A><BR><BR>While these things are going on among the Veneti, Q. Titurius Sabinus 
<A NAME="308"></A>with those troops which he had received from Caesar, arrives in the territories 
<A NAME="309"></A>of the Unelli. Over these people Viridovix ruled, and held the chief command 
<A NAME="310"></A>of all those states which had revolted; from which he had collected a large 
<A NAME="311"></A>and powerful army. And in those few days, the Aulerci and the Sexovii, 
<A NAME="312"></A>having slain their senate because they would not consent to be promoters 
<A NAME="313"></A>of the war, shut their gates [against us] and united themselves to Viridovix; 
<A NAME="314"></A>a great multitude besides of desperate men and robbers assembled out of 
<A NAME="315"></A>Gaul from all quarters, whom the hope of plundering and the love of fighting 
<A NAME="316"></A>had called away from husbandry and their daily labor. Sabinus kept himself 
<A NAME="317"></A>within his camp, which was in a position convenient for everything; while 
<A NAME="318"></A>Viridovix encamped over against him at a distance of two miles, and daily 
<A NAME="319"></A>bringing out his forces, gave him an opportunity of fighting; so that Sabinus 
<A NAME="320"></A>had now not only come into contempt with the enemy, but also was somewhat 
<A NAME="321"></A>taunted by the speeches of our soldiers; and furnished so great a suspicion 
<A NAME="322"></A>of his cowardice that the enemy presumed to approach even to the very rampart 
<A NAME="323"></A>of our camp. He adopted this conduct for the following reason: because 
<A NAME="324"></A>he did not think that a lieutenant ought to engage in battle with so great 
<A NAME="325"></A>a force, especially while he who held the chief command was absent, except 
<A NAME="326"></A>on advantageous ground or some favorable circumstance presented 
<A NAME="327"></A>itself.
<A NAME="328"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 18</B>
<A NAME="329"></A><BR><BR>After having established this suspicion of his cowardice, he selected 
<A NAME="330"></A>a certain suitable and crafty Gaul, who was one of those whom he had with 
<A NAME="331"></A>him as auxiliaries. He induces him by great gifts and promises to go over 
<A NAME="332"></A>to the enemy; and informs [him] of what he wished to be done. Who, when 
<A NAME="333"></A>he arrives among them as a deserter, lays before them the fears of the 
<A NAME="334"></A>Romans; and informs them by what difficulties Caesar himself was harassed, 
<A NAME="335"></A>and that the matter was not far removed from this - that Sabinus would 
<A NAME="336"></A>the next night privately draw off his army out of the camp and set forth 
<A NAME="337"></A>to Caesar for the purpose of carrying [him] assistance, which, when they 
<A NAME="338"></A>heard, they a11 cry out together that an opportunity of successfully conducting 
<A NAME="339"></A>their enterprise, ought not to be thrown away: that they ought to go to 
<A NAME="340"></A>the [Roman] camp. Many things persuaded the Gauls to this measure; the 
<A NAME="341"></A>delay of Sabinus during the previous days; the positive assertion of the 
<A NAME="342"></A>[pretended] deserter; want of provisions, for a supply of which they had 
<A NAME="343"></A>not taken the requisite precautions; the hope springing from the Venetic 
<A NAME="344"></A>war; and [also] because in most cases men willingly believe what they wish. 
<A NAME="345"></A>Influenced by these things they do not discharge Viridovix and the other 
<A NAME="346"></A>leaders from the council, before they gained permission from them to take 
<A NAME="347"></A>up arms and hasten to [our] camp; which being granted, rejoicing as if 
<A NAME="348"></A>victory were fully certain, they collected faggots and brushwood, with 
<A NAME="349"></A>which to fill up the Roman trenches, and hasten to the 
<A NAME="350"></A>camp.
<A NAME="351"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 19</B>
<A NAME="352"></A><BR><BR>The situation of the camp was a rising ground, gently sloping from 
<A NAME="353"></A>the bottom for about a mile. Thither they proceeded with great speed (in 
<A NAME="354"></A>order that as little time as possible might be given to the Romans to collect 
<A NAME="355"></A>and arm themselves), and arrived quite out of breath. Sabinus having encouraged 
<A NAME="356"></A>his men, gives them the signal, which they earnestly desired. While the 
<A NAME="357"></A>enemy were encumbered by reason of the burdens which they were carrying, 
<A NAME="358"></A>he orders a sally to be made suddenly from two gates [of the camp]. It 
<A NAME="359"></A>happened, by the advantage of situation, by the unskilfulness and the fatigue 
<A NAME="360"></A>of the enemy, by the valor of our soldiers, and their experience in former 
<A NAME="361"></A>battles, that they could not stand one attack of our men, and immediately 
<A NAME="362"></A>turned their backs; and our men with full vigor followed them while disordered, 
<A NAME="363"></A>and slew a great number of them; the horse pursuing the rest, left but 
<A NAME="364"></A>few, who escaped by flight. Thus at the same time, Sabinus was informed 
<A NAME="365"></A>of the naval battle and Caesar of victory gained by Sabinus; and all the 
<A NAME="366"></A>states immediately surrendered themselves to Titurius: for as the temper 
<A NAME="367"></A>of the Gauls is impetuous and ready to undertake wars, so their mind is 
<A NAME="368"></A>weak, and by no means resolute in enduring calamities.
<A NAME="369"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 20</B>
<A NAME="370"></A><BR><BR>About the same time, P. Crassus, when he had arrived in Aquitania 
<A NAME="371"></A>(which, as has been before said, both from its extent of territory and 
<A NAME="372"></A>the great number of its people, is to be reckoned a third part of Gaul,) 
<A NAME="373"></A>understanding that he was to wage war in these parts, where a few years 
<A NAME="374"></A>before, L. Valerius Praeconinus, the lieutenant had been killed, and his 
<A NAME="375"></A>army routed, and from which L. Manilius, the proconsul, had fled with the 
<A NAME="376"></A>loss of his baggage, he perceived that no ordinary care must be used by 
<A NAME="377"></A>him. Wherefore, having provided corn, procured auxiliaries and cavalry, 
<A NAME="378"></A>[and] having summoned by name many valiant men from Tolosa, Carcaso, and 
<A NAME="379"></A>Narbo, which are the states of the province of Gaul, that border on these 
<A NAME="380"></A>regions [Aquitania], he led his army into the territories of the Sotiates. 
<A NAME="381"></A>On his arrival being known, the Sotiates having brought together great 
<A NAME="382"></A>forces and [much] cavalry, in which their strength principally lay, and 
<A NAME="383"></A>assailing our army on the march, engaged first in a cavalry action, then 
<A NAME="384"></A>when their cavalry was routed, and our men pursuing, they suddenly display 
<A NAME="385"></A>their infantry forces, which they had placed in ambuscade in a valley. 
<A NAME="386"></A>These attacked our men [while] disordered, and renewed the 
<A NAME="387"></A>fight.
<A NAME="388"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 21</B>
<A NAME="389"></A><BR><BR>The battle was long and vigorously contested, since the Sotiates, 
<A NAME="390"></A>relying on their former victories, imagined that the safety of the whole 
<A NAME="391"></A>of Aquitania rested on their valor; [and] our men, on the other hand, desired 
<A NAME="392"></A>it might be seen what they could accomplish without their general and without 
<A NAME="393"></A>the other legions, under a very young commander; at length the enemy, worn 
<A NAME="394"></A>out with wounds, began to turn their backs, and a great number of them 
<A NAME="395"></A>being slain, Crassus began to besiege the [principal] town of the Sotiates 
<A NAME="396"></A>on his march. Upon their valiantly resisting, he raised vineae and turrets. 
<A NAME="397"></A>They at one time attempting a sally, at another forming mines, to our rampart 
<A NAME="398"></A>and vineae (at which the Aquitani are eminently skilled, because in many 
<A NAME="399"></A>places among them there are copper mines); when they perceived that nothing 
<A NAME="400"></A>could be gained by these operations through the perseverance of our men, 
<A NAME="401"></A>they send embassadors to Crassus, and entreat him to admit them to a surrender. 
<A NAME="402"></A>Having obtained it, they, being ordered to deliver up their arms, 
<A NAME="403"></A>comply.
<A NAME="404"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 22</B>
<A NAME="405"></A><BR><BR>And while the attention of our men is engaged in that matter, in 
<A NAME="406"></A>another part Adcantuannus, who held the chief command, with 600 devoted 
<A NAME="407"></A>followers whom they call soldurii (the conditions of whose association 
<A NAME="408"></A>are these, - that they enjoy all the conveniences of life with those to 
<A NAME="409"></A>whose friendship they have devoted themselves: if any thing calamitous 
<A NAME="410"></A>happen to them, either they endure the same destiny together with them, 
<A NAME="411"></A>or commit suicide: nor hitherto, in the, memory of men, has there been 
<A NAME="412"></A>found any one who, upon his being slain to whose friendship he had devoted 
<A NAME="413"></A>himself, refused to die); Adcantuannus, [Isay] endeavoring to make a sally 
<A NAME="414"></A>with these, when our soldiers had rushed together to arms, upon a shout 
<A NAME="415"></A>being raised at that part of the, fortification, and a fierce battle had 
<A NAME="416"></A>been fought there, was driven back into the town, yet he obtained from 
<A NAME="417"></A>Crassus [the indulgence] that he should enjoy the same terms of surrender 
<A NAME="418"></A>[as the other inhabitants].
<A NAME="419"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 23</B>
<A NAME="420"></A><BR><BR>Crassus, having received their arms and hostages, marched into 
<A NAME="421"></A>the territories of the Vocates and the Tarusates. But then, the barbarians 
<A NAME="422"></A>being alarmed, because they had heard that a town fortified by the nature 
<A NAME="423"></A>of the place and by art, had been taken by us in a few days after our arrival 
<A NAME="424"></A>there, began to send embassadors into all quarters, to combine, to give 
<A NAME="425"></A>hostages one to another, to raise troops. Embassadors also are sent to 
<A NAME="426"></A>those states of Hither Spain which are nearest to Aquitania, and auxiliaries 
<A NAME="427"></A>and leaders are summoned from them; on whose arrival they proceed to carry 
<A NAME="428"></A>on the war with great confidence, and with a great host of men. They who 
<A NAME="429"></A>had been with Q. Sertorius the whole period [of his war in Spain] and were 
<A NAME="430"></A>supposed to have very great skill in military matters, are chosen leaders. 
<A NAME="431"></A>These, adopting the practice of the Roman people, begin to select [advantageous] 
<A NAME="432"></A>places, to fortify their camp, to cut off our men from provisions, which, 
<A NAME="433"></A>when Crassus observes, [and likewise] that his forces, on account of their 
<A NAME="434"></A>small number could not safely be separated; that the enemy both made excursions 
<A NAME="435"></A>and beset the passes, and [yet] left sufficient guard for their camp; that 
<A NAME="436"></A>on that account, corn and provision could not very conveniently be brought 
<A NAME="437"></A>up to him, and that the number of the enemy was daily increased, he thought 
<A NAME="438"></A>that he ought not to delay in giving battle. This matter being brought 
<A NAME="439"></A>to a council, when he discovered that all thought the same thing, he appointed 
<A NAME="440"></A>the next day for the fight.
<A NAME="441"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 24</B>
<A NAME="442"></A><BR><BR>Having drawn out all his forces at the break of day, and marshaled 
<A NAME="443"></A>them in a double line, he posted the auxiliaries in the center, and waited 
<A NAME="444"></A>to see what measures the enemy would take. They, although on account of 
<A NAME="445"></A>their great number and their ancient renown in war, and the small number 
<A NAME="446"></A>of our men, they supposed they might safely fight, nevertheless considered 
<A NAME="447"></A>it safer to gain the victory without any wound, by besetting the passes 
<A NAME="448"></A>[and] cutting off the provisions: and if the Romans, on account of the 
<A NAME="449"></A>want of corn, should begin to retreat, they intended to attack them while 
<A NAME="450"></A>encumbered in their march and depressed in spirit [as being assailed while] 
<A NAME="451"></A>under baggage. This measure being approved of by the leaders and the forces 
<A NAME="452"></A>of the Romans drawn out, the enemy [still] kept themselves in their camp. 
<A NAME="453"></A>Crassus having remarked this circumstance, since the enemy, intimidated 
<A NAME="454"></A>by their own delay, and by the reputation [i.e. for cowardice arising thence] 
<A NAME="455"></A>had rendered our soldiers more eager for fighting, and the remarks of all 
<A NAME="456"></A>were heard [declaring] that no longer ought delay to be made in going to 
<A NAME="457"></A>the camp, after encouraging his men, he marches to the camp of the enemy, 
<A NAME="458"></A>to the great gratification of his own troops.)
<A NAME="459"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 25</B>
<A NAME="460"></A><BR><BR>There, while some were filling up the ditch, and others, by throwing 
<A NAME="461"></A>a large number of darts, were driving the defenders from the rampart and 
<A NAME="462"></A>fortifications, and the auxiliaries, on whom Crassus did not much rely 
<A NAME="463"></A>in the battle, by supplying stones and weapons [to the soldiers], and by 
<A NAME="464"></A>conveying turf to the mound, presented the appearance and character of 
<A NAME="465"></A>men engaged in fighting; while also the enemy were fighting resolutely 
<A NAME="466"></A>and boldly, and their weapons, discharged from their higher position, fell 
<A NAME="467"></A>with great effect; the horse, having gone round the camp of the enemy, 
<A NAME="468"></A>reported to Crassus that the camp was not fortified with equal care on 
<A NAME="469"></A>the side of the Decuman gate, and had an easy approach.
<A NAME="470"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 26</B>
<A NAME="471"></A><BR><BR>Crassus, having exhorted the commanders of the horse to animate 
<A NAME="472"></A>their men by great rewards and promises, points out to them what he wished 
<A NAME="473"></A>to have done. They, as they had been commanded, having brought out the 
<A NAME="474"></A>four cohorts, which, as they had been left as a guard for the camp, were 
<A NAME="475"></A>not fatigued by exertion, and having led them round by a some what longer 
<A NAME="476"></A>way, lest they could be seen from the camp of the enemy, when the eyes 
<A NAME="477"></A>and minds of all were intent upon the battle, quickly arrived at those 
<A NAME="478"></A>fortifications which we have spoken of, and, having demolished these, stood 
<A NAME="479"></A>in the camp of the enemy before they were seen by them, or it was known 
<A NAME="480"></A>what was going on. And then, a shout being heard in that quarter, our men, 
<A NAME="481"></A>their strength having been recruited, (which usually occurs on the hope 
<A NAME="482"></A>of victory), began to fight more vigorously. The enemy surrounded on all 
<A NAME="483"></A>sides, [and] all their affairs being despaired of, made great attempts 
<A NAME="484"></A>to cast themselves down over the ramparts and to seek safety in flight. 
<A NAME="485"></A>These the cavalry pursued over the very open plains, and after leaving 
<A NAME="486"></A>scarcely a fourth part out of the number of 50,000, which it was certain 
<A NAME="487"></A>had assembled out of Aquitania and from the Cantabri, returned late at 
<A NAME="488"></A>night to the camp.
<A NAME="489"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 27</B>
<A NAME="490"></A><BR><BR>Having heard of this battle, the greatest part of Aquitania surrendered 
<A NAME="491"></A>itself to Crassus, and of its own accord sent hostages, in which number 
<A NAME="492"></A>were the Tarbelli, the Bigerriones, the Preciani, the Vocasates, the Tarusates, 
<A NAME="493"></A>the Elurates, the Garites, the Ausci, the Garumni, the Sibuzates, the Cocosates. 
<A NAME="494"></A>A few [and those] most remote nations, relying on the time of the year, 
<A NAME="495"></A>because winter was at hand, neglected to do this.
<A NAME="496"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 28</B>
<A NAME="497"></A><BR><BR>About the same time Caesar, although the summer was nearly past, 
<A NAME="498"></A>yet, since, all Gaul being reduced, the Morini and the Menapii alone remained 
<A NAME="499"></A>in arms, and had never sent embassadors to him [to make a treaty] of peace, 
<A NAME="500"></A>speedily led his army thither, thinking that that war might soon be terminated. 
<A NAME="501"></A>They resolved to conduct the war on a very different method from the rest 
<A NAME="502"></A>of the Gauls; for as they perceived that the greatest nations [of Gaul] 
<A NAME="503"></A>who had engaged in war, had been routed and overcome, and as they possessed 
<A NAME="504"></A>continuous ranges of forests and morasses, they removed themselves and 
<A NAME="505"></A>all their property thither. When Caesar had arrived at the opening of these 
<A NAME="506"></A>forests, and had began to fortify his camp, and no enemy was in the mean 
<A NAME="507"></A>time seen, while our men were dispersed on their respective duties, they 
<A NAME="508"></A>suddenly rushed out from all parts of the forest, and made an attack on 
<A NAME="509"></A>our men. The latter quickly took up arms and drove them back again to their 
<A NAME="510"></A>forests; and having killed a great many, lost a few of their own men while 
<A NAME="511"></A>pursuing them too far through those intricate places.
<A NAME="512"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 29</B>
<A NAME="513"></A><BR><BR>During the remaining days after this, Caesar began to cut down 
<A NAME="514"></A>the forests; and that no attack might be made on the flank of the soldiers, 
<A NAME="515"></A>while unarmed and not foreseeing it, he placed together (opposite to the 
<A NAME="516"></A>enemy) all that timber which was cut down, and piled it up as a rampart 
<A NAME="517"></A>on either flank. When a great space had been, with incredible speed, cleared 
<A NAME="518"></A>in a few days, when the cattle [of the enemy] and the rear of their baggage 
<A NAME="519"></A>train were already seized by our men, and they themselves were seeking 
<A NAME="520"></A>for the thickest parts of the forests, storms of such a kind came on that 
<A NAME="521"></A>the work was necessarily suspended, and, through the continuance of the 
<A NAME="522"></A>rains, the soldiers could not any longer remain in their tents. Therefore, 
<A NAME="523"></A>having laid waste all their country, [and] having burned their villages 
<A NAME="524"></A>and houses, Caesar led back his army and stationed them in winter quarters 
<A NAME="525"></A>among the Aulerci and Lexovii, and the other states which had made war 
<A NAME="526"></A>upon him last.
