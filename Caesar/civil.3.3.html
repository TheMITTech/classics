<A NAME="start"></A>
<A NAME="10"></A><B>Chapter 1</B>
<A NAME="11"></A><BR><BR>Julius Caesar, holding the election as dictator, was himself appointed 
<A NAME="12"></A>consul with Publius Servilius; for this was the year in which it was permitted 
<A NAME="13"></A>by the laws that he should be chosen consul. This business being ended, 
<A NAME="14"></A>as credit was beginning to fail in Italy, and the debts could not be paid, 
<A NAME="15"></A>he determined that arbitrators should be appointed: and that they should 
<A NAME="16"></A>make an estimate of the possessions and properties [of the debtors], how 
<A NAME="17"></A>much they were worth before the war, and that they should be handed over 
<A NAME="18"></A>in payment to the creditors. This he thought the most likely method to 
<A NAME="19"></A>remove and abate the apprehension of an abolition of debt, the usual consequence 
<A NAME="20"></A>of civil wars and dissensions, and to support the credit of the debtors. 
<A NAME="21"></A>He likewise restored to their former condition (the praetors and tribunes, 
<A NAME="22"></A>first submitting the question to the people) some persons condemned for 
<A NAME="23"></A>bribery at the elections, by virtue of Pompey's law, at the time when Pompey 
<A NAME="24"></A>kept his legions quartered in the city (these trials were finished in a 
<A NAME="25"></A>single day, one judge hearing the merits, and another pronouncing the sentences), 
<A NAME="26"></A>because they had offered their service to him in the beginning of the civil 
<A NAME="27"></A>war, if he chose to accept them; setting the same value on them as if he 
<A NAME="28"></A>had accepted them, because they had put themselves in his power. For he 
<A NAME="29"></A>had determined that they ought to be restored rather by the judgment of 
<A NAME="30"></A>the people than appear admitted to it by his bounty: that he might neither 
<A NAME="31"></A>appear ungrateful in repaying an obligation, nor arrogant in depriving 
<A NAME="32"></A>the people of their prerogative of exercising this bounty.
<A NAME="33"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 2</B>
<A NAME="34"></A><BR><BR>In accomplishing these things, and celebrating the Latin festival, 
<A NAME="35"></A>and holding all the elections, he spent eleven days; and having resigned 
<A NAME="36"></A>the dictatorship, set out from the city, and went to Brundusium, where 
<A NAME="37"></A>he had ordered twelve legions and all his cavalry to meet him. But he scarcely 
<A NAME="38"></A>found as many ships as would be sufficient to transport fifteen thousand 
<A NAME="39"></A>legionary soldiers and five hundred horse. This [the scarcity of shipping] 
<A NAME="40"></A>was the only thing that prevented Caesar from putting a speedy conclusion 
<A NAME="41"></A>to the war. And even these troops embarked very short of their number, 
<A NAME="42"></A>because several had fallen in so many wars in Gaul, and the long march 
<A NAME="43"></A>from Spain had lessened their number very much, and a severe autumn in 
<A NAME="44"></A>Apulia and the district about Brundusium, after the very wholesome countries 
<A NAME="45"></A>of Spain and Gaul, had impaired the health of the whole 
<A NAME="46"></A>army.
<A NAME="47"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 3</B>
<A NAME="48"></A><BR><BR>Pompey having got a year's respite to provide forces, during which 
<A NAME="49"></A>he was not engaged in war, nor employed by an enemy, had collected a numerous 
<A NAME="50"></A>fleet from Asia, and the Cyclades, from Corcyra, Athens, Pontus, Bithynia, 
<A NAME="51"></A>Syria, Cilicia, Phoenicia, and Egypt, and had given directions that a great 
<A NAME="52"></A>number should be built in every other place. He had exacted a large sum 
<A NAME="53"></A>of money from Asia, Syria, and all the kings, dynasts, tetrarchs, and free 
<A NAME="54"></A>states of Achaia; and had obliged the corporations of those provinces, 
<A NAME="55"></A>of which he himself had the government, to count down to him a large 
<A NAME="56"></A>sum.
<A NAME="57"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 4</B>
<A NAME="58"></A><BR><BR>He had made up nine legions of Roman citizens; five from Italy, 
<A NAME="59"></A>which he had brought with him; one veteran legion from Sicily, which being 
<A NAME="60"></A>composed of two he called the Gemella; one from Crete and Macedonia, of 
<A NAME="61"></A>veterans who had been discharged by their former generals and had settled 
<A NAME="62"></A>in those provinces; two from Asia, which had been levied by the activity 
<A NAME="63"></A>of Lentulus. Besides, he had distributed among his legions a considerable 
<A NAME="64"></A>number, by way of recruits, from Thessaly, Boeotia, Achaia, and Epirus: 
<A NAME="65"></A>with his legions he also intermixed the soldiers taken from Caius Antonius. 
<A NAME="66"></A>Besides these, he expected two legions from Syria, with Scipio; from Crete, 
<A NAME="67"></A>Lacedaemon, Pontus, Syria, and other states, he got about three thousand 
<A NAME="68"></A>archers, six cohorts of slingers, two thousand mercenary soldiers, and 
<A NAME="69"></A>seven thousand horse; six hundred of which, Deiotarus had brought from 
<A NAME="70"></A>Gaul; Ariobarzanes, five hundred from Cappadocia. Cotus had given him about 
<A NAME="71"></A>the same number from Thrace, and had sent his son Sadalis with them. From 
<A NAME="72"></A>Macedonia there were two hundred, of extraordinary valor, commanded by 
<A NAME="73"></A>Rascipolis; five hundred Gauls and Germans; Gabinius's troops from Alexandria, 
<A NAME="74"></A>whom Aulus Gabinius had left with king Ptolemy, to guard his person. Pompey, 
<A NAME="75"></A>the son, had brought in his fleet eight hundred, whom he had raised among 
<A NAME="76"></A>his own and his shepherds' slaves. Tarcundarius, Castor and Donilaus, had 
<A NAME="77"></A>given three hundred from Gallograecia: one of these came himself, the other 
<A NAME="78"></A>sent his son. Two hundred were sent from Syria by Comagenus Antiochus, 
<A NAME="79"></A>whom Pompey rewarded amply. The most of them were archers. To these were 
<A NAME="80"></A>added Dardanians and Bessians, some of them mercenaries; others procured 
<A NAME="81"></A>by power and influence: also, Macedonians, Thessalians, and troops from 
<A NAME="82"></A>other nations and states, which completed the number which we mentioned 
<A NAME="83"></A>before.
<A NAME="84"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 5</B>
<A NAME="85"></A><BR><BR>He had laid in vast quantities of corn from Thessaly, Asia, Egypt, 
<A NAME="86"></A>Crete, Cyrene, and other countries. He had resolved to fix his winter quarters 
<A NAME="87"></A>at Dyrrachium, Apollonia, and the other seaports, to hinder Caesar from 
<A NAME="88"></A>passing the sea: and for this purpose had stationed his fleet along the 
<A NAME="89"></A>sea-coast. The Egyptian fleet was commanded by Pompey, the son: the Asiatic, 
<A NAME="90"></A>by Decimus Laelius, and Caius Triarius: the Syrian, by Caius Cassius: the 
<A NAME="91"></A>Rhodian, by Caius Marcellus, in conjunction with Caius Coponius: and the 
<A NAME="92"></A>Liburnian and Achaian, by Scribonius Libo, and Marcus Octavius. But Marcus 
<A NAME="93"></A>Bibulus was appointed commander-in-chief of the whole maritime department, 
<A NAME="94"></A>and regulated every matter. The chief direction rested upon 
<A NAME="95"></A>him.
<A NAME="96"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 6</B>
<A NAME="97"></A><BR><BR>When Caesar came to Brundusium, he made a speech to the soldiers: 
<A NAME="98"></A>"That since they were now almost arrived at the termination of their toils 
<A NAME="99"></A>and dangers, they should patiently submit to leave their slaves and baggage 
<A NAME="100"></A>in Italy, and to embark without luggage, that a greater number of men might 
<A NAME="101"></A>be put on board: that they might expect every thing from victory and his 
<A NAME="102"></A>liberality." They cried out with one voice, "he might give what orders 
<A NAME="103"></A>he pleased, that they would cheerfully fulfill them." He accordingly set 
<A NAME="104"></A>sail the fourth day of January, with seven legions on board, as already 
<A NAME="105"></A>remarked. The next day he reached land, between the Ceraunian rocks and 
<A NAME="106"></A>other dangerous places; meeting with a safe road for his shipping to ride 
<A NAME="107"></A>in, and dreading all other ports which he imagined were in possession of 
<A NAME="108"></A>the enemy, he landed his men at a place called Pharsalus, without the loss 
<A NAME="109"></A>of a single vessel.
<A NAME="110"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 7</B>
<A NAME="111"></A><BR><BR>Lucretius Vespillo and Minutius Rufus were at Oricum, with eighteen 
<A NAME="112"></A>Asiatic ships, which were given into their charge by the orders of Decimus 
<A NAME="113"></A>Laelius: Marcus Bibulus at Corcyra, with a hundred and ten ships. But they 
<A NAME="114"></A>had not the confidence to dare to move out of the harbor; though Caesar 
<A NAME="115"></A>had brought only twelve ships as a convoy, only four of which had decks; 
<A NAME="116"></A>nor did Bibulus, his fleet being disordered and his seamen dispersed, come 
<A NAME="117"></A>up in time: for Caesar was seen at the continent, before any account whatsoever 
<A NAME="118"></A>of his approach had reached those regions.
<A NAME="119"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 8</B>
<A NAME="120"></A><BR><BR>Caesar, having landed his soldiers, sent back his ships the same 
<A NAME="121"></A>night to Brundusium, to transport the rest of his legions and cavalry. 
<A NAME="122"></A>The charge of this business was committed to lieutenant Fufius Kalenus, 
<A NAME="123"></A>with orders to be expeditious in transporting the legions. But the ships 
<A NAME="124"></A>having put to sea too late, and not having taken advantage of the night 
<A NAME="125"></A>breeze, fell a sacrifice on their return. For Bibulus at Corcyra, being 
<A NAME="126"></A>informed of Caesar's approach, hoped to fall in with some part of our ships, 
<A NAME="127"></A>with their cargoes, but found them empty; and having taken about thirty, 
<A NAME="128"></A>vented on them his rage at his own remissness, and set them all on fire: 
<A NAME="129"></A>and, with the same flames, he destroyed the mariners and masters of the 
<A NAME="130"></A>vessels, hoping by the severity of the punishment to deter the rest. Having 
<A NAME="131"></A>accomplished this affair, he filled all the harbors and shores from Salona 
<A NAME="132"></A>to Oricum with his fleets. Having disposed his guard with great care, he 
<A NAME="133"></A>lay on board himself in the depth of winter, declining no fatigue or duty, 
<A NAME="134"></A>and not waiting for reinforcements, in hopes that he might come within 
<A NAME="135"></A>Caesar's reach.
<A NAME="136"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 9</B>
<A NAME="137"></A><BR><BR>But after the departure Of the Liburnian fleet, Marcus Octavius 
<A NAME="138"></A>sailed from Illyricum with what ships he had to Salona, and having spirited 
<A NAME="139"></A>up the Dalmatians, and other barbarous nations, he drew Issa off from its 
<A NAME="140"></A>connection with Caesar; but not being able to prevail with the council 
<A NAME="141"></A>of Salona, either by promises or menaces, he resolved to storm the town. 
<A NAME="142"></A>But it was well fortified by its natural situation and a hill. The Roman 
<A NAME="143"></A>citizens built wooden towers, the better to secure it; but when they were 
<A NAME="144"></A>unable to resist, on account of the smallness of their numbers, being weakened 
<A NAME="145"></A>by several wounds, they stooped to the last resource, and set at liberty 
<A NAME="146"></A>all the slaves old enough to bear arms; and cutting the hair off the women's 
<A NAME="147"></A>heads, made ropes for their engines. Octavius, being informed of their 
<A NAME="148"></A>determination, surrounded the town with five encampments, and began to 
<A NAME="149"></A>press them at once with a siege and storm. They were determined to endure 
<A NAME="150"></A>every hardship, and their greatest distress was the want of corn. They, 
<A NAME="151"></A>therefore, sent deputies to Caesar, and begged a supply from him; all other 
<A NAME="152"></A>inconveniences they bore by their own resources, as well as they could: 
<A NAME="153"></A>and after a long interval, when the length of the siege had made Octavius's 
<A NAME="154"></A>troops more remiss than usual, having got an opportunity at noon, when 
<A NAME="155"></A>the enemy were dispersed, they disposed their wives and children on the 
<A NAME="156"></A>walls, to keep up the appearance of their usual attention; and forming 
<A NAME="157"></A>themselves into one body, with the slaves whom they had lately enfranchised, 
<A NAME="158"></A>they made an attack on Octavius's nearest camp, and having forced that, 
<A NAME="159"></A>attacked the second with the same fury; and then the third and the fourth, 
<A NAME="160"></A>and then the other, and beat them from them all: and having killed a great 
<A NAME="161"></A>number, obliged the rest and Octavius himself to fly for refuge to their 
<A NAME="162"></A>ships. This put an end to the blockade. Winter was now approaching, and 
<A NAME="163"></A>Octavius, despairing of capturing the town, after sustaining such considerable 
<A NAME="164"></A>losses, withdrew to Pompey, to Dyrrachium.
<A NAME="165"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 10</B>
<A NAME="166"></A><BR><BR>We have mentioned, that Vibullius Rufus, an officer of Pompey's 
<A NAME="167"></A>had fallen twice into Caesar's power; first at Corfinium, and afterward 
<A NAME="168"></A>in Spain. Caesar thought him a proper person, on account of his favors 
<A NAME="169"></A>conferred on him, to send with proposals to Pompey: and he knew that he 
<A NAME="170"></A>had an influence over Pompey. This was the substance of his proposals: 
<A NAME="171"></A>"That it was the duty of both, to put an end to their obstinacy, and forbear 
<A NAME="172"></A>hostilities, and not tempt fortune any further; that sufficient loss had 
<A NAME="173"></A>been suffered on both sides, to serve as a lesson and instruction to them, 
<A NAME="174"></A>to render them apprehensive of future calamities, by Pompey, in having 
<A NAME="175"></A>been driven out of Italy, and having lost Sicily, Cardinia, and the two 
<A NAME="176"></A>Spains, and one hundred and thirty cohorts of Roman citizens, in Italy 
<A NAME="177"></A>and Spain: by himself, in the death of Curio, and the loss of so great 
<A NAME="178"></A>an army in Africa, and the surrender of his soldiers in Corcyra. Wherefore, 
<A NAME="179"></A>they should have pity on themselves, and the republic: for, from their 
<A NAME="180"></A>own misfortunes, they had sufficient experience of what fortune can effect 
<A NAME="181"></A>in war. That this was the only time to treat for peace; when each had confidence 
<A NAME="182"></A>in his own strength, and both seemed on an equal footing. Since, if fortune 
<A NAME="183"></A>showed ever so little favor to either, he who thought himself superior, 
<A NAME="184"></A>would not submit to terms of accommodation; nor would be content with an 
<A NAME="185"></A>equal division, when he might expect to obtain the whole. That as they 
<A NAME="186"></A>could not agree before, the terms of peace ought to be submitted to the 
<A NAME="187"></A>senate and people in Rome. That in the mean time, it ought to content the 
<A NAME="188"></A>republic and themselves, if they both immediately took oath in a public 
<A NAME="189"></A>assembly that they would disband their forces within the three following 
<A NAME="190"></A>days. That having divested themselves of the arms and auxiliaries, on which 
<A NAME="191"></A>they placed their present confidence, they must both of necessity acquiesce 
<A NAME="192"></A>in the decision of the people and senate. To give Pompey the fuller assurance 
<A NAME="193"></A>of his intentions, he would dismiss all his forces on the land, even his 
<A NAME="194"></A>garrisons.
<A NAME="195"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 11</B>
<A NAME="196"></A><BR><BR>Vibullius, having received this commission from Caesar, thought 
<A NAME="197"></A>it no less necessary to give Pompey notice of Caesar's sudden approach, 
<A NAME="198"></A>that he might adopt such plans as the circumstance required, than to inform 
<A NAME="199"></A>him of Caesar's message; and therefore continuing his journey by night 
<A NAME="200"></A>as well as by day, and taking fresh horses for dispatch, he posted away 
<A NAME="201"></A>to Pompey, to inform him that Caesar was marching toward him with all his 
<A NAME="202"></A>forces. Pompey was at this time in Candavia, and was on his march from 
<A NAME="203"></A>Macedonia to his winter quarters in Apollonia and Dyrrachium; but surprised 
<A NAME="204"></A>at the unexpected news, he determined to go to Apollonia by speedy marches, 
<A NAME="205"></A>to prevent Caesar from becoming master of all the maritime states. But 
<A NAME="206"></A>as soon as Caesar had landed his troops, he set off the same day for Oricum: 
<A NAME="207"></A>when he arrived there, Lucius Torquatus, who was governor of the town by 
<A NAME="208"></A>Pompey's appointment, and had a garrison of Parthinians in it, endeavored 
<A NAME="209"></A>to shut the gates and defend the town, and ordered the Greeks to man the 
<A NAME="210"></A>walls, and to take arms. But as they refused to fight against the power 
<A NAME="211"></A>of the Roman people, and as the citizens made a spontaneous attempt to 
<A NAME="212"></A>admit Caesar, despairing of any assistance, he threw open the gates, and 
<A NAME="213"></A>surrendered himself and the town to Caesar, and was preserved safe from 
<A NAME="214"></A>injury by him.
<A NAME="215"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 12</B>
<A NAME="216"></A><BR><BR>Having taken Oricum, Caesar marched without making any delay to 
<A NAME="217"></A>Apollonia. Staberius the governor, hearing of his approach, began to bring 
<A NAME="218"></A>water into the citadel, and to fortify it, and to demand hostages of the 
<A NAME="219"></A>town's people. But they refuse to give any, or to shut their gates against 
<A NAME="220"></A>the consul, or to take upon them to judge contrary to what all Italy and 
<A NAME="221"></A>the Roman people had judged. As soon as he knew their inclinations, he 
<A NAME="222"></A>made his escape privately. The inhabitants of Apollonia sent embassadors 
<A NAME="223"></A>to Caesar, and gave him admission into their town. Their example was followed 
<A NAME="224"></A>by the inhabitants of Bullis, Amantia, and the other neighboring states, 
<A NAME="225"></A>and all Epirus: and they sent embassadors to Caesar, and promised to obey 
<A NAME="226"></A>his commands.
<A NAME="227"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 13</B>
<A NAME="228"></A><BR><BR>But Pompey having received information of the transactions at Oricum 
<A NAME="229"></A>and Apollonia, began to be alarmed for Dyrrachium, and endeavored to reach 
<A NAME="230"></A>it, marching day and night. As soon as it was said that Caesar was approaching, 
<A NAME="231"></A>such a panic fell upon Pompey's army, because in his haste he had made 
<A NAME="232"></A>no distinction between night and day, and had marched without intermission, 
<A NAME="233"></A>that they almost every man deserted their colors in Epirus and the neighboring 
<A NAME="234"></A>countries; several threw down their arms, and their march had the appearance 
<A NAME="235"></A>of a flight. But when Pompey had halted near Dyrrachium, and had given 
<A NAME="236"></A>orders for measuring out the ground for his camp, his army even yet continuing 
<A NAME="237"></A>in their fright, Labienus first stepped forward and swore that he would 
<A NAME="238"></A>never desert him, and would share whatever fate fortune should assign to 
<A NAME="239"></A>him. The other lieutenants took the same oath, and the tribunes and centurions 
<A NAME="240"></A>followed their example: and the whole army swore in like manner. Caesar, 
<A NAME="241"></A>finding the road to Dyrrachium already in the possession of Pompey, was 
<A NAME="242"></A>in no great haste, but encamped by the river Apsus, in the territory of 
<A NAME="243"></A>Apollonia, that the states which had deserved his support might be certain 
<A NAME="244"></A>of protection from his out-guards and forts; and there he resolved to wait 
<A NAME="245"></A>the arrival of his other legions from Italy, and to winter in tents. Pompey 
<A NAME="246"></A>did the same; and pitching his camp on the other side of the river Apsus, 
<A NAME="247"></A>collected there all his troops and auxiliaries.
<A NAME="248"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 14</B>
<A NAME="249"></A><BR><BR>Kalenus, having put the legions and cavalry on board at Brundusium, 
<A NAME="250"></A>as Caesar had directed him, as far as the number of his ships allowed, 
<A NAME="251"></A>weighed anchor: and having sailed a little distance from port, received 
<A NAME="252"></A>a letter from Caesar, in which he was informed, that all the ports and 
<A NAME="253"></A>the whole shore was occupied by the enemy's fleet: on receiving this information 
<A NAME="254"></A>he returned into the harbor, and recalled all the vessels. One of them, 
<A NAME="255"></A>which continued the voyage and did not obey Kalenus's command, because 
<A NAME="256"></A>it carried no troops, but was private property, bore away for Oricum, and 
<A NAME="257"></A>was taken by Bibulus, who spared neither slaves nor free men, nor even 
<A NAME="258"></A>children; but put all to the sword. Thus the safety of the whole army depended 
<A NAME="259"></A>on a very short space of time and a great casualty.
<A NAME="260"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 15</B>
<A NAME="261"></A><BR><BR>Bibulus, as has been observed before, lay with his fleet near Oricum, 
<A NAME="262"></A>and as he debarred Caesar of the liberty of the sea and harbors, so he 
<A NAME="263"></A>was deprived of all intercourse with the country by land; for the whole 
<A NAME="264"></A>shore was occupied by parties disposed in different places by Caesar. And 
<A NAME="265"></A>he was not allowed to get either wood or water, or even anchor near the 
<A NAME="266"></A>land. He was reduced to great difficulties, and distressed with extreme 
<A NAME="267"></A>scarcity of every necessary; insomuch that he was obliged to bring, in 
<A NAME="268"></A>transports from Corcyra, not only provisions, but even wood and water; 
<A NAME="269"></A>and it once happened that, meeting with violent storms, they were forced 
<A NAME="270"></A>to catch the dew by night which fell on the hides that covered their decks; 
<A NAME="271"></A>yet all these difficulties they bore patiently and without repining, and 
<A NAME="272"></A>thought they ought not to leave the shores and harbors free from blockade. 
<A NAME="273"></A>But when they were suffering under the distress which I have mentioned, 
<A NAME="274"></A>and Libo had joined Bibulus, they both called from on ship-board, to Marcus 
<A NAME="275"></A>Acilius and Statius Marcus, the lieutenants, one of whom commanded the 
<A NAME="276"></A>town, the other the guards on the coast, that they wished to speak to Caesar 
<A NAME="277"></A>on affairs of importance, if permission should be granted them. They add 
<A NAME="278"></A>something further to strengthen the impression that they intended to treat 
<A NAME="279"></A>about an accommodation. In the mean time they requested a truce, and obtained 
<A NAME="280"></A>it from them; for what they proposed seemed to be of importance, and it 
<A NAME="281"></A>was well known that Caesar desired it above all things, and it was imagined 
<A NAME="282"></A>that some advantage would be derived from Bibulus's 
<A NAME="283"></A>proposals.
<A NAME="284"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 16</B>
<A NAME="285"></A><BR><BR>Caesar having set out with one legion to gain possession of the 
<A NAME="286"></A>more remote states, and to provide corn, of which he had but a small quantity, 
<A NAME="287"></A>was at this time at Buthrotum, opposite to Corcyra. There receiving Acilius 
<A NAME="288"></A>and Marcus's letters, informing him of Libo's and Bibulus's demands, he 
<A NAME="289"></A>left his legion behind him, and returned himself to Oricum. When he arrived, 
<A NAME="290"></A>they were invited to a conference. Libo came and made an apology for Bibulus, 
<A NAME="291"></A>"that he was a man of strong passion, and had a private quarrel against 
<A NAME="292"></A>Caesar, contracted when he was aedile and praetor; that for this reason 
<A NAME="293"></A>he had avoided the conference, lest affairs of the utmost importance and 
<A NAME="294"></A>advantage might be impeded by the warmth of his temper. That it now was 
<A NAME="295"></A>and ever had been Pompey's most earnest wish, that they should be reconciled 
<A NAME="296"></A>and lay down their arms, but they were not authorized to treat on that 
<A NAME="297"></A>subject, because they resigned the whole management of the war, and all 
<A NAME="298"></A>other matters to Pompey, by order of the council. But when they were acquainted 
<A NAME="299"></A>with Caesar's demands, they would transmit them to Pompey, who would conclude 
<A NAME="300"></A>all of himself by their persuasions. In the mean time, let the truce be 
<A NAME="301"></A>continued till the messengers could return from him; and let no injury 
<A NAME="302"></A>be done on either side." To this he added a few words of the cause for 
<A NAME="303"></A>which they fought, and of his own forces and resources.
<A NAME="304"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 17</B>
<A NAME="305"></A><BR><BR>To this, Caesar did not then think proper to make any reply, nor 
<A NAME="306"></A>do we now think it worth recording. But Caesar required "that he should 
<A NAME="307"></A>be allowed to send commissioners to Pompey, who should suffer no personal 
<A NAME="308"></A>injury; and that either they should grant it, or should take his commissioners 
<A NAME="309"></A>in charge, and convey them to Pompey. That as to the truce, the war in 
<A NAME="310"></A>its present state was so divided, that they by their fleet deprived him 
<A NAME="311"></A>of his shipping and auxiliaries; while he prevented them from the use of 
<A NAME="312"></A>the land and fresh water; and if they wished that this restraint should 
<A NAME="313"></A>be removed from them, they should relinquish their blockade of the seas, 
<A NAME="314"></A>but if they retained the one, he in like manner would retain the other; 
<A NAME="315"></A>that nevertheless, the treaty of accommodation might still be carried on, 
<A NAME="316"></A>though these points were not conceded, and that they need not be an impediment 
<A NAME="317"></A>to it." They would neither receive Caesar's commissioners, nor guarantee 
<A NAME="318"></A>their safety, but referred the whole to Pompey. They urged and struggled 
<A NAME="319"></A>eagerly to gain the one point respecting a truce. But when Caesar perceived 
<A NAME="320"></A>that they had proposed the conference merely to avoid present danger and 
<A NAME="321"></A>distress, but that they offered no hopes or terms of peace, he applied 
<A NAME="322"></A>his thoughts to the prosecution of the war.
<A NAME="323"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 18</B>
<A NAME="324"></A><BR><BR>Bibulus, being prevented from landing for several days, and being 
<A NAME="325"></A>seized with a violent distemper from the cold and fatigue, as he could 
<A NAME="326"></A>neither be cured on board, nor was willing to desert the charge which he 
<A NAME="327"></A>had taken upon him, was unable to bear up against the violence of the disease. 
<A NAME="328"></A>On his death, the sole command devolved on no single individual, but each 
<A NAME="329"></A>admiral managed his own division separately, and at his own discretion. 
<A NAME="330"></A>Vibullius, as soon as the alarm, which Caesar's unexpected arrival had 
<A NAME="331"></A>raised, was over, began again to deliver Caesar's message in the presence 
<A NAME="332"></A>of Libo, Lucius Lucceius, and Theophanes, to whom Pompey used to communicate 
<A NAME="333"></A>his most confidential secrets. He had scarcely entered on the subject when 
<A NAME="334"></A>Pompey interrupted him, and forbade him to proceed. "What need," says he, 
<A NAME="335"></A>"have I of life or Rome, if the world shall think I enjoy them by the bounty 
<A NAME="336"></A>of Caesar: an opinion which can never be removed while it shall be thought 
<A NAME="337"></A>that I have been brought back by him to Italy, from which I set out." After 
<A NAME="338"></A>the conclusion of the war, Caesar was informed of these expressions by 
<A NAME="339"></A>some persons who were present at the conversation. He attempted, however, 
<A NAME="340"></A>by other means to bring about a negotiation of peace.
<A NAME="341"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 19</B>
<A NAME="342"></A><BR><BR>Between Pompey's and Caesar's camp there was only the river Apsus, 
<A NAME="343"></A>and the soldiers frequently conversed with each other; and by a private 
<A NAME="344"></A>arrangement among themselves, no weapons were thrown during their conferences. 
<A NAME="345"></A>Caesar sent Publius Vatinius, one of his lieutenants, to the bank of the 
<A NAME="346"></A>river, to make such proposals as should appear most conducive to peace; 
<A NAME="347"></A>and to cry out frequently with a loud voice [asking], "Are citizens permitted 
<A NAME="348"></A>to send deputies to citizens to treat of peace? a concession which had 
<A NAME="349"></A>been made even to fugitives on the Pyrenean mountains, and to robbers, 
<A NAME="350"></A>especially when by so doing they would prevent citizens from fighting against 
<A NAME="351"></A>citizens." Having spoken much in humble language, as became a man pleading 
<A NAME="352"></A>for his own and the general safety and being listened to with silence by 
<A NAME="353"></A>the soldiers of both armies, he received an answer from the enemy's party 
<A NAME="354"></A>that Aulus Varro proposed coming the next day to a conference, and that 
<A NAME="355"></A>deputies from both sides might come without danger, and explain their wishes, 
<A NAME="356"></A>and accordingly a fixed time was appointed for the interview. When the 
<A NAME="357"></A>deputies met the next day, a great multitude from both sides assembled, 
<A NAME="358"></A>and the expectations of every person concerning this subject were raised 
<A NAME="359"></A>very high, and their minds seemed to be eagerly disposed for peace. Titus 
<A NAME="360"></A>Labienus walked forward from the crowd, and in submissive terms began to 
<A NAME="361"></A>speak of peace, and to argue with Vatinius. But their conversation was 
<A NAME="362"></A>suddenly interrupted by darts thrown from all sides, from which Vatinius 
<A NAME="363"></A>escaped by being protected by the arms of the soldiers. However, several 
<A NAME="364"></A>were wounded; and among them Cornelius Balbus, Marcus Plotius, and Lucius 
<A NAME="365"></A>Tiburtius, centurions, and some privates; hereupon Labienus exclaimed, 
<A NAME="366"></A>"Forbear, then, to speak any more about an accommodation, for we can have 
<A NAME="367"></A>no peace unless we carry Caesar's head back with us."
<A NAME="368"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 20</B>
<A NAME="369"></A><BR><BR>At the same time in Rome, Marcus Caelius Rufus, one of the praetors, 
<A NAME="370"></A>having undertaken the cause of the debtors, on entering into his office, 
<A NAME="371"></A>fixed his tribunal near the bench of Caius Trebonius, the city praetor, 
<A NAME="372"></A>and promised if any person appealed to him in regard to the valuation and 
<A NAME="373"></A>payment of debts made by arbitration, as appointed by Caesar when in Rome, 
<A NAME="374"></A>that he would relieve them. But it happened, from the justice of Trebonius's 
<A NAME="375"></A>decrees and his humanity (for he thought that in such dangerous times justice 
<A NAME="376"></A>should be administered with moderation and compassion), that not one could 
<A NAME="377"></A>be found who would offer himself the first to lodge an appeal. For to plead 
<A NAME="378"></A>poverty, to complain of his own private calamities, or the general distresses 
<A NAME="379"></A>of the times, or to assert the difficulty of setting the goods to sale, 
<A NAME="380"></A>is the behavior of a man even of a moderate temper; but to retain their 
<A NAME="381"></A>possessions entire, and at the same time acknowledge themselves in debt, 
<A NAME="382"></A>what sort of spirit, and what impudence would it not have argued! Therefore 
<A NAME="383"></A>nobody was found so unreasonable as to make such demands. But Caelius proved 
<A NAME="384"></A>more severe to those very persons for whose advantage it had been designed; 
<A NAME="385"></A>and starting from this beginning, in order that he might not appear to 
<A NAME="386"></A>have engaged in so dishonorable an affair without effecting something, 
<A NAME="387"></A>he promulgated a law that all debts should be discharged in six equal payments, 
<A NAME="388"></A>of six months each, without interest.
<A NAME="389"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 21</B>
<A NAME="390"></A><BR><BR>When Servilius, the consul, and the other magistrates opposed him, 
<A NAME="391"></A>and he himself effected less than he expected, in order to raise the passions 
<A NAME="392"></A>of the people, he dropped it, and promulgated two others; one, by which 
<A NAME="393"></A>he remitted the annual rents of the houses to the tenants, the other, an 
<A NAME="394"></A>act of insolvency: upon which the mob made an assault on Caius Trebonius, 
<A NAME="395"></A>and having wounded several persons, drove him from his tribunal. The consul 
<A NAME="396"></A>Servilius informed the senate of his proceedings, who passed a decree that 
<A NAME="397"></A>Caelius should be removed from the management of the republic. Upon this 
<A NAME="398"></A>decree, the consul forbade him the senate; and when he was attempting to 
<A NAME="399"></A>harangue the people, turned him out of the rostrum. Stung with the ignominy 
<A NAME="400"></A>and with resentment, he pretended in public that he would go to Caesar, 
<A NAME="401"></A>but privately sent messengers to Milo, who had murdered Clodius, and had 
<A NAME="402"></A>been condemned for it; and having invited him into Italy, because he had 
<A NAME="403"></A>engaged the remains of the gladiators to his interest, by making them ample 
<A NAME="404"></A>presents, he joined him, and sent him to Thurinum to tamper with the shepherds. 
<A NAME="405"></A>When he himself was on his road to Casilinum, at the same time that his 
<A NAME="406"></A>military standards and arms were seized at Capua, his slaves seen at Naples, 
<A NAME="407"></A>and the design of betraying the town discovered: his plots being revealed, 
<A NAME="408"></A>and Capua shut against him, being apprehensive of danger, because the Roman 
<A NAME="409"></A>citizens residing there had armed themselves, and thought he ought to be 
<A NAME="410"></A>treated as an enemy to the state, he abandoned his first design, and changed 
<A NAME="411"></A>his route.
<A NAME="412"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 22</B>
<A NAME="413"></A><BR><BR>Milo in the mean time dispatched letters to the free towns, purporting 
<A NAME="414"></A>that he acted as he did by the orders and commands of Pompey, conveyed 
<A NAME="415"></A>to him by Bibulus: and he endeavored to engage in his interest all persons 
<A NAME="416"></A>whom he imagined were under difficulties by reason of their debts. But 
<A NAME="417"></A>not being able to prevail with them, he set at liberty some slaves from 
<A NAME="418"></A>the work-houses, and began to assault Cosa in the district of Thurinum. 
<A NAME="419"></A>There having received a blow of a stone thrown from the wall of the town 
<A NAME="420"></A>which was commanded by Quintus Pedius with one legion, he died of it; and 
<A NAME="421"></A>Caelius having set out, as he pretended for Caesar, went to Thurii, where 
<A NAME="422"></A>he was put to death as he was tampering with some of the freemen of the 
<A NAME="423"></A>town, and was offering money to Caesar's Gallic and Spanish horse, which 
<A NAME="424"></A>he had sent there to strengthen the garrison. And thus these mighty beginnings, 
<A NAME="425"></A>which had embroiled Italy, and kept the magistrates employed, found a speedy 
<A NAME="426"></A>and happy issue.
<A NAME="427"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 23</B>
<A NAME="428"></A><BR><BR>Libo having sailed from Oricum, with a fleet of fifty ships, which 
<A NAME="429"></A>he commanded, came to Brundusium, and seized an island, which lies opposite 
<A NAME="430"></A>to the harbor; judging it better to guard that place, which was our only 
<A NAME="431"></A>pass to sea, than to keep all the shores and ports blocked up by a fleet. 
<A NAME="432"></A>By his sudden arrival, he fell in with some of our transports, and set 
<A NAME="433"></A>them on fire, and carried off one laden with corn; he struck great terror 
<A NAME="434"></A>into our men, and having in the night landed a party of soldiers and archers, 
<A NAME="435"></A>he beat our guard of horse from their station, and gained so much by the 
<A NAME="436"></A>advantage of situation, that he dispatched letters to Pompey, and if he 
<A NAME="437"></A>pleased he might order the rest of the ships to be hauled upon shore and 
<A NAME="438"></A>repaired; for that with his own fleet he could prevent Caesar from receiving 
<A NAME="439"></A>his auxiliaries.
<A NAME="440"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 24</B>
<A NAME="441"></A><BR><BR>Antonius was at this time at Brundusium, and relying on the valor 
<A NAME="442"></A>of his troops, covered about sixty of the long-boats belonging to the men-of-war 
<A NAME="443"></A>with penthouses and bulwarks of hurdles, and put on board them select soldiers; 
<A NAME="444"></A>and disposed them separately along the shore: and under the pretext of 
<A NAME="445"></A>keeping the seamen in exercise, he ordered two three-banked galleys, which 
<A NAME="446"></A>he had built at Brundusium, to row to the mouth of the port. When Libo 
<A NAME="447"></A>saw them advancing boldly toward him, he sent five four-banked galleys 
<A NAME="448"></A>against them, in hopes of intercepting them. When these came near our ships, 
<A NAME="449"></A>our veteran soldiers retreated within the harbor. The enemy, urged by their 
<A NAME="450"></A>eagerness to capture them, pursued them unguardedly: for instantly the 
<A NAME="451"></A>boats of Antonius, on a certain signal, rowed with great violence from 
<A NAME="452"></A>all parts against the enemy; and at the first charge took one of the four-banked 
<A NAME="453"></A>galleys, with the seamen and marines, and forced the rest to flee disgracefully. 
<A NAME="454"></A>In addition to this loss, they were prevented from getting water by the 
<A NAME="455"></A>horse which Antonius had disposed along the sea-coast. Libo, vexed at the 
<A NAME="456"></A>distress and disgrace, departed from Brundusium, and abandoned the 
<A NAME="457"></A>blockade.
<A NAME="458"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 25</B>
<A NAME="459"></A><BR><BR>Several months had now elapsed, and winter was almost gone, and 
<A NAME="460"></A>Caesar's legions and shipping were not coming to him from Brundusium, and 
<A NAME="461"></A>he imagined that some opportunities had been neglected, for the winds had 
<A NAME="462"></A>at least been often favorable, and he thought that he must trust to them 
<A NAME="463"></A>at last. And the longer it was deferred, the more eager were those who 
<A NAME="464"></A>commanded Pompey's fleet to guard the coast, and were more confident of 
<A NAME="465"></A>preventing our getting assistance: they received frequent reproofs from 
<A NAME="466"></A>Pompey by letter, that as they had not prevented Caesar's arrival at the 
<A NAME="467"></A>first, they should at least stop the remainder of his army: and they were 
<A NAME="468"></A>expecting that the season for transporting troops, would become more unfavorable 
<A NAME="469"></A>every day, as the winds grew calmer. Caesar, feeling some trouble on this 
<A NAME="470"></A>account, wrote in severe terms to his officers at Brundusium, [and gave 
<A NAME="471"></A>them orders] that as soon as they found the wind to answer, they should 
<A NAME="472"></A>not let the opportunity of setting sail pass by, if they were even to steer 
<A NAME="473"></A>their course to the shore of Apollonia: because there they might run their 
<A NAME="474"></A>ships on ground. That these parts principally were left unguarded by the 
<A NAME="475"></A>enemy's fleet, because they dare not venture too far from the 
<A NAME="476"></A>harbor.
<A NAME="477"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 26</B>
<A NAME="478"></A><BR><BR>They [his officers], exerting boldness and courage, aided by the 
<A NAME="479"></A>instructions of Marcus Antonius, and Fusius Kalenus, and animated by the 
<A NAME="480"></A>soldiers strongly encouraging them, and declining no danger for Caesar's 
<A NAME="481"></A>safety, having got a southerly wind, weighed anchor, and the next day were 
<A NAME="482"></A>carried past Apollonia and Dyrrachium, and being seen from the continent, 
<A NAME="483"></A>Quintus Coponius, who commanded the Rhodian fleet at Dyrrachium, put out 
<A NAME="484"></A>of the port with his ships; and when they had almost come up with us, in 
<A NAME="485"></A>consequence of the breeze dying away, the south wind sprang up afresh, 
<A NAME="486"></A>and rescued us. However, he did not desist from his attempt, but hoped 
<A NAME="487"></A>by the labor and perseverance of his seamen to be able to bear up against 
<A NAME="488"></A>the violence of the storm; and although we were carried beyond Dyrrachium, 
<A NAME="489"></A>by the violence of the wind, he nevertheless continued to chase us. Our 
<A NAME="490"></A>men, taking advantage of fortune's kindness, for they were still afraid 
<A NAME="491"></A>of being attacked by the enemy's fleet, if the wind abated, having come 
<A NAME="492"></A>near a port, called Nymphaeum, about three miles beyond Lissus, put into 
<A NAME="493"></A>it (this port is protected from a south-west wind, but is not secure against 
<A NAME="494"></A>a south wind); and thought less danger was to be apprehended from the storm 
<A NAME="495"></A>than from the enemy. But as soon as they were within the port, the south 
<A NAME="496"></A>wind, which had blown for two days, by extraordinary good luck veered round 
<A NAME="497"></A>to the south-west.
<A NAME="498"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 27</B>
<A NAME="499"></A><BR><BR>Here one might observe the sudden turns of fortune. We who, a moment 
<A NAME="500"></A>before, were alarmed for ourselves, were safely lodged in a very secure 
<A NAME="501"></A>harbor: and they who had threatened ruin to our fleet, were forced to be 
<A NAME="502"></A>uneasy on their own account: and thus, by a change of circumstances, the 
<A NAME="503"></A>storm protected our ships, and damaged the Rhodian fleet to such a degree 
<A NAME="504"></A>that all their decked ships, sixteen in number, foundered, without exception, 
<A NAME="505"></A>and were wrecked: and of the prodigious number of seamen and soldiers, 
<A NAME="506"></A>some lost their lives by being dashed against the rocks, others were taken 
<A NAME="507"></A>by our men: but Caesar sent them all safe home.
<A NAME="508"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 28</B>
<A NAME="509"></A><BR><BR>Two of our ships, that had not kept up with the rest, being overtaken 
<A NAME="510"></A>by the night, and not knowing what port the rest had made to, came to an 
<A NAME="511"></A>anchor opposite Lissus. Otacilius Crassus, who commanded Pompey's fleet, 
<A NAME="512"></A>detached after them several barges and small craft, and attempted to take 
<A NAME="513"></A>them. At the same time, he treated with them about capitulating, and promised 
<A NAME="514"></A>them their lives if they would surrender. One of them carried two hundred 
<A NAME="515"></A>and twenty recruits, the other was manned with somewhat less than two hundred 
<A NAME="516"></A>veterans. Here it might be seen what security men derive from a resolute 
<A NAME="517"></A>spirit. For the recruits, frightened at the number of vessels, and fatigued 
<A NAME="518"></A>with the rolling of the sea, and with sea-sickness, surrendered to Otacilius, 
<A NAME="519"></A>after having first received his oath, that the enemy would not injure them; 
<A NAME="520"></A>but as soon as they were brought before him, contrary to the obligation 
<A NAME="521"></A>of his oath, they were inhumanly put to death in his presence. But the 
<A NAME="522"></A>soldiers of the veteran legion, who had also struggled, not only with the 
<A NAME="523"></A>inclemency of the weather, but by laboring at the pump, thought it their 
<A NAME="524"></A>duty to remit nothing of their former valor: and having protracted the 
<A NAME="525"></A>beginning of the night in settling the terms, under pretense of surrendering, 
<A NAME="526"></A>they obliged the pilot to run the ship aground: and having got a convenient 
<A NAME="527"></A>place on the shore, they spent the rest of the night there, and at day-break, 
<A NAME="528"></A>when Otacilius had sent against them a party of the horse, who guarded 
<A NAME="529"></A>that part of the coast, to the number of four hundred, beside some armed 
<A NAME="530"></A>men, who had followed them from the garrison, they made a brave defense, 
<A NAME="531"></A>and having killed some of them, retreated in safety to our 
<A NAME="532"></A>army.
<A NAME="533"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 29</B>
<A NAME="534"></A><BR><BR>After this action, the Roman citizens, who resided at Lissus, a 
<A NAME="535"></A>town which Caesar had before assigned them, and had carefully fortified, 
<A NAME="536"></A>received Antony into their town, and gave him every assistance. Otacilius, 
<A NAME="537"></A>apprehensive for his own safety, escaped out of the town, and went to Pompey. 
<A NAME="538"></A>All his forces, whose number amounted to three veteran legions, and one 
<A NAME="539"></A>of recruits, and about eight hundred horse being landed, Antony sent most 
<A NAME="540"></A>of his ships back to Italy, to transport the remainder of the soldiers 
<A NAME="541"></A>and horse. The pontons, which are a sort of Gallic ships, he left at Lissus 
<A NAME="542"></A>with this object, that if Pompey, imagining Italy defenseless, should transport 
<A NAME="543"></A>his army thither (and this notion was spread among the common people), 
<A NAME="544"></A>Caesar might have some means of pursuing him; and he sent messengers to 
<A NAME="545"></A>him with great dispatch, to inform him in what part of the country he had 
<A NAME="546"></A>landed his army, and what number of troops he had brought over with 
<A NAME="547"></A>him.
<A NAME="548"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 30</B>
<A NAME="549"></A><BR><BR>Caesar and Pompey received this intelligence almost at the same 
<A NAME="550"></A>time; for they had seen the ships sail past Apollonia and Dyrrachium. They 
<A NAME="551"></A>directed their march after them by land; but at first they were ignorant 
<A NAME="552"></A>to what part they had been carried; but when they were informed of it, 
<A NAME="553"></A>they each adopted a different plan; Caesar, to form a junction with Antonius 
<A NAME="554"></A>as soon as possible; Pompey, to oppose Antonius's forces on their march 
<A NAME="555"></A>to Caesar, and, if possible, to fall upon them unexpectedly from ambush. 
<A NAME="556"></A>And the same day they both led out their armies from their winter encampment 
<A NAME="557"></A>along the river Apsus; Pompey, privately by night; Caesar, openly by day. 
<A NAME="558"></A>But Caesar had to march a longer circuit up the river to find a ford. Pompey's 
<A NAME="559"></A>route being easy, because he was not obliged to cross the river, he advanced 
<A NAME="560"></A>rapidly and by forced marches against Antonius, and being informed of his 
<A NAME="561"></A>approach, chose a convenient situation, where he posted his forces; and 
<A NAME="562"></A>kept his men close within camp, and forbade fires to be kindled, that his 
<A NAME="563"></A>arrival might be the more secret. An account of this was immediately carried 
<A NAME="564"></A>to Antonius by the Greeks. He dispatched messengers to Caesar, and confined 
<A NAME="565"></A>himself in his camp for one day. The next day Caesar, came up with him. 
<A NAME="566"></A>On learning his arrival, Pompey, to prevent his being hemmed in between 
<A NAME="567"></A>two armies, quitted his position, and went with all his forces to Asparagium, 
<A NAME="568"></A>in the territory of Dyrrachium, and there encamped in a convenient 
<A NAME="569"></A>situation.
<A NAME="570"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 31</B>
<A NAME="571"></A><BR><BR>During these times, Scipio, though he had sustained some losses 
<A NAME="572"></A>near mount Amanus, had assumed to himself the title of imperator, after 
<A NAME="573"></A>which he demanded large sums of money from the states and princes. He had 
<A NAME="574"></A>also exacted from the tax-gatherers, two years' rents that they owed; and 
<A NAME="575"></A>enjoined them to lend him the amount of the next year, and demanded a supply 
<A NAME="576"></A>of horse from the whole province. When they were collected, leaving behind 
<A NAME="577"></A>him his neighboring enemies, the Parthians (who shortly before had killed 
<A NAME="578"></A>Marcus Crassus, the imperator, and had kept Marcus Bibulus besieged), he 
<A NAME="579"></A>drew his legions and cavalry out of Syria; and when he came into the province, 
<A NAME="580"></A>which was under great anxiety and fear of the Parthian war, and heard some 
<A NAME="581"></A>declarations of the soldiers, "That they would march against an enemy, 
<A NAME="582"></A>if he would lead them on; but would never bear arms against a countryman 
<A NAME="583"></A>and consul;" he drew off his legions to winter quarters to Pergamus, and 
<A NAME="584"></A>the most wealthy cities, and made them rich presents: and in order to attach 
<A NAME="585"></A>them more firmly to his interest, permitted them to plunder the 
<A NAME="586"></A>cities.
<A NAME="587"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 32</B>
<A NAME="588"></A><BR><BR>In the mean time, the money which had been demanded from the province 
<A NAME="589"></A>at large, was most vigorously exacted. Besides, many new imposts of different 
<A NAME="590"></A>kinds were devised to gratify his avarice. A tax of so much a head was 
<A NAME="591"></A>laid on every slave and child. Columns, doors, corn, soldiers, sailors, 
<A NAME="592"></A>arms, engines, and carriages, were made subject to a duty. Wherever a name 
<A NAME="593"></A>could be found for any thing, it was deemed a sufficient reason for levying 
<A NAME="594"></A>money on it. Officers were appointed to collect it, not only in the cities, 
<A NAME="595"></A>but in almost every village and fort: and whosoever of them acted with 
<A NAME="596"></A>the greatest rigor and inhumanity, was esteemed the best man, and best 
<A NAME="597"></A>citizen. The province was overrun with bailiffs and officers, and crowded 
<A NAME="598"></A>with overseers and tax-gatherers; who, besides the duties imposed, exacted 
<A NAME="599"></A>a gratuity for themselves; for they asserted, that being expelled from 
<A NAME="600"></A>their own homes and countries, they stood in need of every necessary; endeavoring 
<A NAME="601"></A>by a plausible pretense, to color the most infamous conduct. To this was 
<A NAME="602"></A>added the most exorbitant interest, as usually happens in times of war; 
<A NAME="603"></A>the whole sums being called in, on which occasion, they alleged that the 
<A NAME="604"></A>delay of a single day was a donation. Therefore, in those two years, the 
<A NAME="605"></A>debt of the province was doubled: but notwithstanding, taxes were exacted, 
<A NAME="606"></A>not only from the Roman citizens, but from every corporation and every 
<A NAME="607"></A>state. And they said that these were loans, exacted by the senate's decree. 
<A NAME="608"></A>The taxes of the ensuing year were demanded beforehand as a loan from the 
<A NAME="609"></A>collectors, as on their first appointment.
<A NAME="610"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 33</B>
<A NAME="611"></A><BR><BR>Moreover, Scipio ordered the money formerly lodged in the temple 
<A NAME="612"></A>of Diana at Ephesus, to be taken out with the statues of that goddess, 
<A NAME="613"></A>which remained there. When Scipio came to the temple, letters were delivered 
<A NAME="614"></A>to him from Pompey, in the presence of several senators, whom he had called 
<A NAME="615"></A>upon to attend him; [informing him] that Caesar had crossed the sea with 
<A NAME="616"></A>his legions; that Scipio should hasten to him with his army, and postpone 
<A NAME="617"></A>all other business. As soon as he received the letter, he dismissed his 
<A NAME="618"></A>attendants, and began to prepare for his journey to Macedonia; and a few 
<A NAME="619"></A>days after set out. This circumstance saved the money at 
<A NAME="620"></A>Ephesus.
<A NAME="621"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 34</B>
<A NAME="622"></A><BR><BR>Caesar, having effected a junction with Antonius's army, and having 
<A NAME="623"></A>drawn his legion out of Oricum, which he had left there to guard the coast, 
<A NAME="624"></A>thought he ought to sound the inclination of the provinces, and march further 
<A NAME="625"></A>into the country; and when embassadors came to him from Thessaly and Aetolia, 
<A NAME="626"></A>to engage that the states in those countries would obey his orders, if 
<A NAME="627"></A>he sent a garrison to protect them, he dispatched Lucius Cassius Longinus, 
<A NAME="628"></A>with the twenty-seventh, a legion composed of young soldiers, and two hundred 
<A NAME="629"></A>horse, to Thessaly: and Caius Calvisius Sabinus, with five cohorts, and 
<A NAME="630"></A>a small party of horse, into Aetolia. He recommended them to be especially 
<A NAME="631"></A>careful to provide corn, because those regions were nearest to him. He 
<A NAME="632"></A>ordered Cneius Domitius Calvinus to march into Macedonia with two legions, 
<A NAME="633"></A>the eleventh and twelfth, and five hundred horse; from which province, 
<A NAME="634"></A>Menedemus, the principal man of those regions, on that side which is called 
<A NAME="635"></A>the Free, having come as embassador, assured him of the most devoted affection 
<A NAME="636"></A>of all his subjects.
<A NAME="637"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 35</B>
<A NAME="638"></A><BR><BR>Of these Calvisius, on his first arrival in Aetolia, being very 
<A NAME="639"></A>kindly received, dislodged the enemy's garrisons in Calydon and Naupactus, 
<A NAME="640"></A>and made himself master of the whole country. Cassius went to Thessaly 
<A NAME="641"></A>with his legion. As there were two factions there, he, found the citizens 
<A NAME="642"></A>divided in their inclinations. Hegasaretus, a man of established power, 
<A NAME="643"></A>favored Pompey's interest. Petreius, a young man of a most noble family, 
<A NAME="644"></A>warmly supported Caesar with his own and his friends' 
<A NAME="645"></A>influence.
<A NAME="646"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 36</B>
<A NAME="647"></A><BR><BR>At the same time, Domitius arrived in Macedonia: and when numerous 
<A NAME="648"></A>embassies had begun to wait on him from many of the states, news was brought 
<A NAME="649"></A>that Scipio was approaching with his legions, which occasioned various 
<A NAME="650"></A>opinions and reports; for in strange events, rumor generally goes before. 
<A NAME="651"></A>Without making any delay in any part of Macedonia, he marched with great 
<A NAME="652"></A>haste against Domitius; and when he was come within about twenty miles 
<A NAME="653"></A>of him, wheeled on a sudden toward Cassius Longinus in Thessaly. He effected 
<A NAME="654"></A>this with such celerity, that news of his march and arrival came together; 
<A NAME="655"></A>for to render his march expeditious, he left the baggage of his legions 
<A NAME="656"></A>behind him at the river Haliacmon, which divides Macedonia from Thessaly, 
<A NAME="657"></A>under the care of Marcus Favonius, with a guard of eight cohorts, and ordered 
<A NAME="658"></A>him to build a strong fort there. At the same time, Cotus's cavalry, which 
<A NAME="659"></A>used to infest the neighborhood of Macedonia, flew to attack Cassius's 
<A NAME="660"></A>camp, at which Cassius being alarmed, and having received information of 
<A NAME="661"></A>Scipio's approach, and seen the horse, which he imagined to be Scipio's, 
<A NAME="662"></A>he betook himself to the mountains that environ Thessaly, and thence began 
<A NAME="663"></A>to make his route toward Ambracia. But when Scipio was hastening to pursue 
<A NAME="664"></A>him, dispatches overtook him from Favonius, that Domitius was marching 
<A NAME="665"></A>against him with his legions, and that he could not maintain the garrison 
<A NAME="666"></A>over which he was appointed, without Scipio's assistance. On receipt of 
<A NAME="667"></A>these dispatches, Scipio changed his designs and his route, desisted from 
<A NAME="668"></A>his pursuit of Cassius, and hastened to relieve Favonius. Accordingly, 
<A NAME="669"></A>continuing his march day and night, he came to him so opportunely, that 
<A NAME="670"></A>the dust raised by Domitius's army, and Scipio's advanced guard, were observed 
<A NAME="671"></A>at the same instant. Thus, the vigilance of Domitius saved Cassius, and 
<A NAME="672"></A>the expedition of Scipio, Favonius.
<A NAME="673"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 37</B>
<A NAME="674"></A><BR><BR>Scipio, having staid for two days in his camp, along the river 
<A NAME="675"></A>Haliacmon, which ran between him and Domitius's camp, on the third day, 
<A NAME="676"></A>at dawn, led his army across a ford, and having made a regular encampment 
<A NAME="677"></A>the day following, drew up his forces in front of his camp. Domitius thought 
<A NAME="678"></A>he ought not to show any reluctance, but should draw out his forces and 
<A NAME="679"></A>hazard a battle. But as there was a plain six miles in breadth between 
<A NAME="680"></A>the two camps, he posted his army before Scipio's camp; while the latter 
<A NAME="681"></A>persevered in not quitting his intrenchment. However, Domitius with difficulty 
<A NAME="682"></A>restrained his men, and prevented their beginning a battle; the more so 
<A NAME="683"></A>as a rivulet with steep banks, joining Scipio's camp, retarded the progress 
<A NAME="684"></A>of our men. When Scipio perceived the eagerness and alacrity of our troops 
<A NAME="685"></A>to engage, suspecting that he should be obliged the next day, either to 
<A NAME="686"></A>fight, against his inclination, or to incur great disgrace by keeping within 
<A NAME="687"></A>his camp, though he had come with high expectation, yet by advancing rashly, 
<A NAME="688"></A>made a shameful end; and at night crossed the river, without even giving 
<A NAME="689"></A>the signal for breaking up the camp, and returned to the ground from which 
<A NAME="690"></A>he came, and there encamped near the river, on an elevated situation. After 
<A NAME="691"></A>a few days, he placed a party of horse in ambush in the night, where our 
<A NAME="692"></A>men had usually gone to forage for several days before. And when Quintus 
<A NAME="693"></A>Varus, commander of Domitius's horse, came there as usual, they suddenly 
<A NAME="694"></A>rushed from their ambush. But our men bravely supported their charge, and 
<A NAME="695"></A>returned quickly every man to his own rank, and in their turn, made a general 
<A NAME="696"></A>charge on the enemy; and having killed about eighty of them, and put the 
<A NAME="697"></A>rest to flight, retreated to their camp with the loss of only two 
<A NAME="698"></A>men.
<A NAME="699"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 38</B>
<A NAME="700"></A><BR><BR>After these transactions, Domitius, hoping to allure Scipio to 
<A NAME="701"></A>a battle, pretended to be obliged to change his position through want of 
<A NAME="702"></A>corn, and having given the signal for decamping, advanced about three miles, 
<A NAME="703"></A>and posted his army and cavalry in a convenient place, concealed from the 
<A NAME="704"></A>enemy's view. Scipio being in readiness to pursue him, detached his cavalry 
<A NAME="705"></A>and a considerable number of light infantry to explore Domitius's route. 
<A NAME="706"></A>When they had marched a short way, and their foremost troops were within 
<A NAME="707"></A>reach of our ambush, their suspicions being raised by the neighing of the 
<A NAME="708"></A>horses, they began to retreat: and the rest who followed them, observing 
<A NAME="709"></A>with what speed they retreated, made a halt. Our men, perceiving that the 
<A NAME="710"></A>enemy had discovered their plot, and thinking it in vain to wait for any 
<A NAME="711"></A>more, having got two troops in their power, intercepted them. Among them 
<A NAME="712"></A>was Marcus Opimius, general of the horse, but he made his escape: they 
<A NAME="713"></A>either killed or took prisoners all the rest of these two troops, and brought 
<A NAME="714"></A>them to Domitius.
<A NAME="715"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 39</B>
<A NAME="716"></A><BR><BR>Caesar, having drawn his garrisons out of the sea-ports, as before 
<A NAME="717"></A>mentioned, left three cohorts at Oricum to protect the town, and committed 
<A NAME="718"></A>to them the charge of his ships of war, which he had transported from Italy. 
<A NAME="719"></A>Acilius, as lieutenant-general, had the charge of this duty and the command 
<A NAME="720"></A>of the town; he drew the ships into the inner part of the harbor, behind 
<A NAME="721"></A>the town, and fastened them to the shore, and sank a merchant-ship in the 
<A NAME="722"></A>mouth of the harbor to block it up; and near it he fixed another at anchor, 
<A NAME="723"></A>on which he raised a turret, and faced it to the entrance of the port, 
<A NAME="724"></A>and filled it with soldiers, and ordered them to keep guard against any 
<A NAME="725"></A>sudden attack.
<A NAME="726"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 40</B>
<A NAME="727"></A><BR><BR>Cneius, Pompey's son, who commanded the Egyptian fleet, having 
<A NAME="728"></A>got intelligence of these things, came to Oricum, and weighed up the ship, 
<A NAME="729"></A>that had been sunk, with a windlass, and by straining at it with several 
<A NAME="730"></A>ropes, and attacked the other which had been placed by Acilius to watch 
<A NAME="731"></A>the port with several ships, on which he had raised very high turrets, 
<A NAME="732"></A>so that fighting as it were from an eminence, and sending fresh men constantly 
<A NAME="733"></A>to relieve the fatigued, and at the same time attempting the town on all 
<A NAME="734"></A>sides by land, with ladders and his fleet, in order to divide the force 
<A NAME="735"></A>of his enemies, he overpowered our men by fatigue, and the immense number 
<A NAME="736"></A>of darts, and took the ship, having beat off the men that were put on board 
<A NAME="737"></A>to defend it, who, however, made their escape in small boats; and at the, 
<A NAME="738"></A>same time he seized a natural mole on the opposite side, which almost formed 
<A NAME="739"></A>an island over against the town. He carried over land, into the inner part 
<A NAME="740"></A>of the harbor, four galleys, by putting rollers under them, and driving 
<A NAME="741"></A>them on with levers. Then attacking on both sides the ships of war which 
<A NAME="742"></A>were moored to the shore, and were not manned, he carried off four of them, 
<A NAME="743"></A>and set the rest on fire. After dispatching this business, he left Decimus 
<A NAME="744"></A>Laelius, whom he had taken away from the command of the Asiatic fleet, 
<A NAME="745"></A>to hinder provisions from being brought into the town from Biblis and Amantia, 
<A NAME="746"></A>and went himself to Lissus, where he attacked thirty merchantmen, left 
<A NAME="747"></A>within the port by Antonius, and set them on fire. He attempted to storm 
<A NAME="748"></A>Lissus, but being delayed three days by the vigorous defense of the Roman 
<A NAME="749"></A>citizens who belonged to that district, and of the soldiers which Caesar 
<A NAME="750"></A>had sent to keep garrison there, and having lost a few men in the assault, 
<A NAME="751"></A>he returned without effecting his object.
<A NAME="752"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 41</B>
<A NAME="753"></A><BR><BR>As soon as Caesar heard that Pompey was at Asparagium, he set out 
<A NAME="754"></A>for that place with his army, and having taken the capital of the Parthinians 
<A NAME="755"></A>on his march, where there was a garrison of Pompey's, he reached Pompey 
<A NAME="756"></A>in Macedonia, on the third day, and encamped beside him; and the day following 
<A NAME="757"></A>having drawn out all his forces before his camp, he offered Pompey battle. 
<A NAME="758"></A>But perceiving that he kept within his trenches, he led his army back to 
<A NAME="759"></A>his camp, and thought of pursuing some other plan. Accordingly, the day 
<A NAME="760"></A>following, he set out with all his forces by a long circuit, through a 
<A NAME="761"></A>difficult and narrow road to Dyrrachium; hoping, either that Pompey would 
<A NAME="762"></A>be compelled to follow him to Dyrrachium, or that his communication with 
<A NAME="763"></A>it might be cut off, because he had deposited there all his provisions 
<A NAME="764"></A>and material of war. And so it happened; for Pompey, at first not knowing 
<A NAME="765"></A>his design, because he imagined he had taken a route in a different direction 
<A NAME="766"></A>from that country, thought that the scarcity of provisions had obliged 
<A NAME="767"></A>him to shift his quarters; but having afterward got true intelligence from 
<A NAME="768"></A>his scouts, he decamped the day following, hoping to prevent him by taking 
<A NAME="769"></A>a shorter road; which Caesar suspecting might happen, encouraged his troops 
<A NAME="770"></A>to submit cheerfully to the fatigue, and having halted a very small part 
<A NAME="771"></A>of the night, he arrived early in the morning at Dyrrachium, when the van 
<A NAME="772"></A>of Pompey's army was visible at a distance, and there he 
<A NAME="773"></A>encamped.
<A NAME="774"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 42</B>
<A NAME="775"></A><BR><BR>Pompey, being cut off from Dyrrachium, as he was unable to effect 
<A NAME="776"></A>his purpose, took a new resolution, and intrenched himself strongly on 
<A NAME="777"></A>a rising ground, which is called Petra, where ships of a small size can 
<A NAME="778"></A>come in, and be sheltered from some winds. Here he ordered a part of his 
<A NAME="779"></A>men of war to attend him, and corn and provisions to be brought from Asia, 
<A NAME="780"></A>and from all the countries of which he kept possession. Caesar, imagining 
<A NAME="781"></A>that the war would be protracted to too great a length, and despairing 
<A NAME="782"></A>of his convoys from Italy, because all the coasts were guarded with great 
<A NAME="783"></A>diligence by Pompey's adherents; and because his own fleets, which he had 
<A NAME="784"></A>built during the winter, in Sicily, Gaul, and Italy, were detained; sent 
<A NAME="785"></A>Lucius Canuleius into Epirus to procure corn; and because these countries 
<A NAME="786"></A>were too remote, he fixed granaries in certain places, and regulated the 
<A NAME="787"></A>carriage of the corn for the neighboring states. He likewise gave directions 
<A NAME="788"></A>that search should be made for whatever corn was in Lissus, the country 
<A NAME="789"></A>of the Parthini, and all the places of strength. The quantity was very 
<A NAME="790"></A>small, both from the nature of the land (for the country is rough and mountainous, 
<A NAME="791"></A>and the people commonly import what grain they use); and because Pompey 
<A NAME="792"></A>had foreseen what would happen, and some days before had plundered the 
<A NAME="793"></A>Parthini, and having ravaged and dug up their houses, carried off all the 
<A NAME="794"></A>corn, which he collected by means of his horse.
<A NAME="795"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 43</B>
<A NAME="796"></A><BR><BR>Caesar, on being informed of these transactions, pursued measures 
<A NAME="797"></A>suggested by the nature of the country. For round Pompey's camps there 
<A NAME="798"></A>were several high and rough hills. These he first of all occupied with 
<A NAME="799"></A>guards, and raised strong forts on them. Then drawing a fortification from 
<A NAME="800"></A>one fort to another, as the nature of each position allowed, he began to 
<A NAME="801"></A>draw a line of circumvallation round Pompey, with these views; as he had 
<A NAME="802"></A>but a small quantity of corn, and Pompey was strong in cavalry, that he 
<A NAME="803"></A>might furnish his army with corn and other necessaries from all sides with 
<A NAME="804"></A>less danger; secondly, to prevent Pompey from foraging, and thereby render 
<A NAME="805"></A>his horse ineffectual in the operations of the war; and thirdly, to lessen 
<A NAME="806"></A>his reputation, on which he saw he depended greatly, among foreign nations, 
<A NAME="807"></A>when a report should have spread throughout the world that he was blockaded 
<A NAME="808"></A>by Caesar, and dare not hazard a battle.
<A NAME="809"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 44</B>
<A NAME="810"></A><BR><BR>Neither was Pompey willing to leave the sea and Dyrrachium, because 
<A NAME="811"></A>he had lodged his material there, his weapons, arms, and engines; and supplied 
<A NAME="812"></A>his army with corn from it by his ships; nor was he able to put a stop 
<A NAME="813"></A>to Caesar's works without hazarding a battle, which at that time he had 
<A NAME="814"></A>determined not to do. Nothing was left but to adopt the last resource, 
<A NAME="815"></A>namely, to possess himself of as many hills as he could, and cover as great 
<A NAME="816"></A>an extent of country as possible with his troops, and divide Caesar's forces 
<A NAME="817"></A>as much as possible; and so it happened: for having raised twenty-four 
<A NAME="818"></A>forts, and taken in a compass of fifteen miles, he got forage in this space, 
<A NAME="819"></A>and within this circuit there were several fields lately sown, in which 
<A NAME="820"></A>the cattle might feed in the mean time. And as our men, who had completed 
<A NAME="821"></A>their works by drawing lines of communication from one fort to another, 
<A NAME="822"></A>were afraid that Pompey's men would sally out from some part, and attack 
<A NAME="823"></A>us in the rear; so the enemy were making a continued fortification in a 
<A NAME="824"></A>circuit within ours to prevent us from breaking in on any side, or surrounding 
<A NAME="825"></A>them on the rear. But they completed their works first; both because they 
<A NAME="826"></A>had a greater number of men, and because they had a smaller compass to 
<A NAME="827"></A>inclose. When Caesar attempted to gain any place, though Pompey had resolved 
<A NAME="828"></A>not to oppose him with his whole force, or to come to a general engagement, 
<A NAME="829"></A>yet he detached to particular places slingers and archers, with which his 
<A NAME="830"></A>army abounded, and several of our men were wounded, and filled with great 
<A NAME="831"></A>dread of the arrows; and almost all the soldiers made coats or coverings 
<A NAME="832"></A>for themselves of hair cloths, tarpaulins, or raw hides to defend them 
<A NAME="833"></A>against the weapons.
<A NAME="834"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 45</B>
<A NAME="835"></A><BR><BR>In seizing the posts, each exerted his utmost power. Caesar, to 
<A NAME="836"></A>confine Pompey within as narrow a compass as possible; Pompey, to occupy 
<A NAME="837"></A>as many hills as he could in as large a circuit as possible, and several 
<A NAME="838"></A>skirmishes were fought in consequence of it. In one of these, when Caesar's 
<A NAME="839"></A>ninth legion had gained a certain post, and had begun to fortify it, Pompey 
<A NAME="840"></A>possessed himself of a hill near to and opposite the same place, and endeavored 
<A NAME="841"></A>to annoy the men while at work; and as the approach on one side was almost 
<A NAME="842"></A>level, he first surrounded it with archers and slingers, and afterward 
<A NAME="843"></A>by detaching a strong party of light infantry, and using his engines, he 
<A NAME="844"></A>stopped our works; and it was no easy matter for our men at once to defend 
<A NAME="845"></A>themselves, and to proceed with their fortifications. When Caesar perceived 
<A NAME="846"></A>that his troops were wounded from all sides, he determined to retreat and 
<A NAME="847"></A>give up the post; his retreat was down a precipice, on which account they 
<A NAME="848"></A>pushed on with more spirit, and would not allow us to retire, because they 
<A NAME="849"></A>imagined that we resigned the place through fear. It is reported that Pompey 
<A NAME="850"></A>said that day in triumph to his friends about him, "That he would consent 
<A NAME="851"></A>to be accounted a general of no experience, if Caesar's legions effected 
<A NAME="852"></A>a retreat without considerable loss from that ground into which they had 
<A NAME="853"></A>rashly advanced."
<A NAME="854"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 46</B>
<A NAME="855"></A><BR><BR>Caesar, being uneasy about the retreat of his soldiers, ordered 
<A NAME="856"></A>hurdles to be carried to the further side of the hill, and to be placed 
<A NAME="857"></A>opposite to the enemy, and behind them a trench of a moderate breadth to 
<A NAME="858"></A>be sunk by his soldiers under shelter of the hurdles; and the ground to 
<A NAME="859"></A>be made as difficult as possible. He himself disposed slingers in convenient 
<A NAME="860"></A>places to cover our men in their retreat. These things being completed, 
<A NAME="861"></A>he ordered his legions to file off: Pompey's men insultingly and boldly 
<A NAME="862"></A>pursued and chased us, leveling the hurdles that were thrown up in the 
<A NAME="863"></A>front of our works, in order to pass over the trench. Which as soon as 
<A NAME="864"></A>Caesar perceived, being afraid that his men would appear not to retreat, 
<A NAME="865"></A>but to be repulsed, and that greater loss might be sustained, when his 
<A NAME="866"></A>men were almost half way down the hill, he encouraged them by Antonius, 
<A NAME="867"></A>who commanded that legion, ordered the signal of battle to be sounded, 
<A NAME="868"></A>and a charge to be made on the enemy. The soldiers of the ninth legion 
<A NAME="869"></A>suddenly closing their files, threw their javelins, and advancing impetuously 
<A NAME="870"></A>from the low ground up the steep, drove Pompey's men precipitately before 
<A NAME="871"></A>them, and obliged them to turn their backs; but their retreat was greatly 
<A NAME="872"></A>impeded by the hurdles that lay in a long line before them, and the palisadoes 
<A NAME="873"></A>which were in their way, and the trenches that were sunk. But our men being 
<A NAME="874"></A>contented to retreat without injury, having killed several of the enemy, 
<A NAME="875"></A>and lost but five of their own, very quietly retired, and having seized 
<A NAME="876"></A>some other hills somewhat on this side of that place, completed their 
<A NAME="877"></A>fortifications.
<A NAME="878"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 47</B>
<A NAME="879"></A><BR><BR>This method of conducting a war was new and unusual, as well on 
<A NAME="880"></A>account of the number of forts, the extent and greatness of the works, 
<A NAME="881"></A>and the manner of attack and defense, as on account of other circumstances. 
<A NAME="882"></A>For all who have attempted to besiege any person, have attacked the enemy 
<A NAME="883"></A>when they were frightened or weak, or after a defeat; or have been kept 
<A NAME="884"></A>in fear of some attack, when they themselves have had a superior force 
<A NAME="885"></A>both of foot and horse. Besides, the usual design of a siege is to cut 
<A NAME="886"></A>off the enemy's supplies. On the contrary, Caesar, with an inferior force, 
<A NAME="887"></A>was inclosing troops sound and unhurt, and who had abundance of all things. 
<A NAME="888"></A>For there arrived every day a prodigious number of ships, which brought 
<A NAME="889"></A>them provisions: nor could the wind blow from any point, that would not 
<A NAME="890"></A>be favorable to some of them. Whereas, Caesar, having consumed all the 
<A NAME="891"></A>corn far and near, was in very great distress, but his soldiers bore all 
<A NAME="892"></A>with uncommon patience. For they remembered that they lay under the same 
<A NAME="893"></A>difficulties last year in Spain, and yet by labor and patience had concluded 
<A NAME="894"></A>a dangerous war. They recollected too that they had suffered an alarming 
<A NAME="895"></A>scarcity at Alesia, and a much greater at Avaricum, and yet had returned 
<A NAME="896"></A>victorious over mighty nations. They refused neither barley nor pulse when 
<A NAME="897"></A>offered them, and they held in great esteem cattle, of which they got great 
<A NAME="898"></A>quantities from Epirus.
<A NAME="899"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 48</B>
<A NAME="900"></A><BR><BR>There was a sort of root called chara, discovered by the troops 
<A NAME="901"></A>which served under Valerius. This they mixed up with milk, and it greatly 
<A NAME="902"></A>contributed to relieve their want. They made it into a sort of bread. They 
<A NAME="903"></A>had great plenty of it; loaves made of this, when Pompey's men upbraided 
<A NAME="904"></A>ours with want, they frequently threw among them to damp their 
<A NAME="905"></A>hopes.
<A NAME="906"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 49</B>
<A NAME="907"></A><BR><BR>The corn was now beginning to ripen, and their hope supported their 
<A NAME="908"></A>want, as they were confident of having abundance in a short time. And there 
<A NAME="909"></A>were frequently heard declarations of the soldiers on guard, in discourse 
<A NAME="910"></A>with each other, that they would rather live on the bark of the trees, 
<A NAME="911"></A>than let Pompey escape from their hands. For they were often told by deserters, 
<A NAME="912"></A>that they could scarcely maintain their horses, and that their other cattle 
<A NAME="913"></A>was dead: that they themselves were not in good health from their confinement 
<A NAME="914"></A>within so narrow a compass, from the noisome smell, the number of carcasses, 
<A NAME="915"></A>and the constant fatigue to them, being men unaccustomed to work, and laboring 
<A NAME="916"></A>under a great want of water. For Caesar had either turned the course of 
<A NAME="917"></A>all the rivers and streams which ran to the sea, or had dammed them up 
<A NAME="918"></A>with strong works. And as the country was mountainous, and the valleys 
<A NAME="919"></A>narrow at the bottom, he inclosed them with piles sunk in the ground, and 
<A NAME="920"></A>heaped up mold against them to keep in the water. They were therefore obliged 
<A NAME="921"></A>to search for low and marshy grounds, and to sink wells, and they had this 
<A NAME="922"></A>labor in addition to their daily works. And even these springs were at 
<A NAME="923"></A>a considerable distance from some of their posts, and soon dried up with 
<A NAME="924"></A>the heat. But Caesar's army enjoyed perfect health and abundance of water, 
<A NAME="925"></A>and had plenty of all sorts of provisions except corn; and they had a prospect 
<A NAME="926"></A>of better times approaching, and saw greater hopes laid before them by 
<A NAME="927"></A>the ripening of the grain.
<A NAME="928"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 50</B>
<A NAME="929"></A><BR><BR>In this new kind of war, new methods of managing it were invented 
<A NAME="930"></A>by both generals. Pompey's men, perceiving by our fires at night, at what 
<A NAME="931"></A>part of the works our cohorts were on guard, coming silently upon them 
<A NAME="932"></A>discharged their arrows at random among the whole multitude, and instantly 
<A NAME="933"></A>retired to their camp; as a remedy against which our men were taught by 
<A NAME="934"></A>experience to light their fires in one place, and keep guard in another.Note: 
<A NAME="935"></A>The translator felt that some of the original text was missing at this 
<A NAME="936"></A>point.
<A NAME="937"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 51</B>
<A NAME="938"></A><BR><BR>In the mean time, Publius Sylla, whom Caesar at his departure had 
<A NAME="939"></A>left governor of his camp, came up with two legions to assist the cohort; 
<A NAME="940"></A>upon whose arrival Pompey's forces were easily repulsed. Nor did they stand 
<A NAME="941"></A>the sight and charge of our men, and the foremost falling, the rest turned 
<A NAME="942"></A>their backs and quitted the field. But Sylla called our men in from the 
<A NAME="943"></A>pursuit, lest their ardor should carry them too far, but most people imagine 
<A NAME="944"></A>that if he had consented to a vigorous pursuit, the war might have been 
<A NAME="945"></A>ended that day. His conduct however does not appear to deserve censure; 
<A NAME="946"></A>for the duties of a lieutenant-general, and of a commander-in-chief, are 
<A NAME="947"></A>very different; the one is bound to act entirely according to his instructions, 
<A NAME="948"></A>the other to regulate his conduct without control, as occasion requires. 
<A NAME="949"></A>Sylla, being deputed by Caesar to take care of the camp, and having rescued 
<A NAME="950"></A>his men, was satisfied with that, and did not desire to hazard a battle 
<A NAME="951"></A>(although this circumstance might probably have had a successful issue), 
<A NAME="952"></A>that he might not be thought to have assumed the part of the general. One 
<A NAME="953"></A>circumstance laid the Pompeians under great difficulty in making good a 
<A NAME="954"></A>retreat: for they had advanced from disadvantageous ground, and were posted 
<A NAME="955"></A>on the top of a hill. If they attempted to retire down the steep, they 
<A NAME="956"></A>dreaded the pursuit of our men from the rising ground, and there was but 
<A NAME="957"></A>a short time till sunset: for in hopes of completing the business, they 
<A NAME="958"></A>had protracted the battle almost till night. Taking therefore measures 
<A NAME="959"></A>suited to their exigency, and to the shortness of the time, Pompey possessed 
<A NAME="960"></A>himself of an eminence, at such a distance from our fort that no weapon 
<A NAME="961"></A>discharged from an engine could reach him. Here he took up a position, 
<A NAME="962"></A>and fortified it, and kept all his forces there.
<A NAME="963"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 52</B>
<A NAME="964"></A><BR><BR>At the same time, there were engagements in two other places; for 
<A NAME="965"></A>Pompey had attacked several forts at once, in order to divide our forces; 
<A NAME="966"></A>that no relief might be sent from the neighboring posts. In one place, 
<A NAME="967"></A>Volcatius Tullus sustained the charge of a legion with three cohorts, and 
<A NAME="968"></A>beat them off the field. In another, the Germans, having sallied over our 
<A NAME="969"></A>fortifications, slew several of the enemy, and retreated safe to our 
<A NAME="970"></A>camp.
<A NAME="971"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 53</B>
<A NAME="972"></A><BR><BR>Thus six engagements having happened in one day, three at Dyrrachium, 
<A NAME="973"></A>and three at the fortifications, when a computation was made of the number 
<A NAME="974"></A>of slain, we found that about two thousand fell on Pompey's side, several 
<A NAME="975"></A>of them volunteer veterans and centurions. Among them was Valerius, the 
<A NAME="976"></A>son of Lucius Flaccus, who as praetor had formerly had the government of 
<A NAME="977"></A>Asia, and six military standards were taken. Of our men, not more than 
<A NAME="978"></A>twenty were missing in all the action. But in the fort, not a single soldier 
<A NAME="979"></A>escaped without a wound; and in one cohort, four centurions lost their 
<A NAME="980"></A>eyes. And being desirous to produce testimony of the fatigue they under 
<A NAME="981"></A>went, and the danger they sustained, they counted to Caesar about thirty 
<A NAME="982"></A>thousand arrows which had been thrown into the fort; and in the shield 
<A NAME="983"></A>of the centurion Scaeva, which was brought to him, were found two hundred 
<A NAME="984"></A>and thirty holes. In reward for this man's services, both to himself and 
<A NAME="985"></A>the public, Caesar presented to him two hundred thousand pieces of copper 
<A NAME="986"></A>money, and declared him promoted from the eighth to the first centurion. 
<A NAME="987"></A>For it appeared that the fort had been in a great measure saved by his 
<A NAME="988"></A>exertions; and he afterward very amply rewarded the cohorts with double 
<A NAME="989"></A>pay, corn, clothing, and other military honors.
<A NAME="990"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 54</B>
<A NAME="991"></A><BR><BR>Pompey, having made great additions to his works in the night, 
<A NAME="992"></A>the following days built turrets, and having carried his works fifteen 
<A NAME="993"></A>feet high, faced that part of his camp with mantelets; and after an interval 
<A NAME="994"></A>of five days, taking advantage of a second cloudy night, he barricaded 
<A NAME="995"></A>all the gates of his camp to hinder a pursuit, and about midnight, quietly 
<A NAME="996"></A>marched off his army, and retreated to his old fortifications.
<A NAME="997"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 55</B>
<A NAME="998"></A><BR><BR>Aetolia, Acarnania, and Amphilochis, being reduced, as we have 
<A NAME="999"></A>related, by Cassius Longinus, and Calvisius Sabinus, Caesar thought he 
<A NAME="1000"></A>ought to attempt the conquest of Achaia, and to advance further into the 
<A NAME="1001"></A>country. Accordingly, he detached Fufius thither, and ordered Quintus Sabinus 
<A NAME="1002"></A>and Cassius to join him with their cohorts. Upon notice of their approach, 
<A NAME="1003"></A>Rutilius Lupus, who commanded in Achaia, under Pompey, began to fortify 
<A NAME="1004"></A>the Isthmus, to prevent Fufius from coming into Achaia. Kalenus recovered 
<A NAME="1005"></A>Delphi, Thebes, and Orchomenus, by a voluntary submission of those states. 
<A NAME="1006"></A>Some he subdued by force, the rest he endeavored to win over to Caesar's 
<A NAME="1007"></A>interest, by sending deputies round to them. In these things, principally, 
<A NAME="1008"></A>Fusius was employed.
<A NAME="1009"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 56</B>
<A NAME="1010"></A><BR><BR>Every day afterward, Caesar drew up his army on a level ground, 
<A NAME="1011"></A>and offered Pompey battle, and led his legions almost close to Pompey's 
<A NAME="1012"></A>camp; and his front line was at no greater distance from the rampart than 
<A NAME="1013"></A>that no weapon from their engines could reach it. But Pompey, to save his 
<A NAME="1014"></A>credit and reputation with the world, drew out his legions, but so close 
<A NAME="1015"></A>to his camp, that his rear line might touch the rampart, and that his whole 
<A NAME="1016"></A>army, when drawn up, might be protected by the darts discharged from 
<A NAME="1017"></A>it.
<A NAME="1018"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 57</B>
<A NAME="1019"></A><BR><BR>While these things were going forward in Achaia and at Dyrrachium, 
<A NAME="1020"></A>and when it was certainly known that Scipio was arrived in Macedonia, Caesar, 
<A NAME="1021"></A>never losing sight of his first intention, sends Clodius to him, an intimate 
<A NAME="1022"></A>friend to both, whom Caesar, on the introduction and recommendation of 
<A NAME="1023"></A>Pompey, had admitted into the number of his acquaintance. To this man he 
<A NAME="1024"></A>gave letters and instructions to Pompey, the substance of which was as 
<A NAME="1025"></A>follows: "That he had made every effort toward peace, and imputed the ill 
<A NAME="1026"></A>success of those efforts to the fault of those whom he had employed to 
<A NAME="1027"></A>conduct those negotiations; because they were afraid to carry his proposals 
<A NAME="1028"></A>to Pompey at an improper time. That Scipio had such authority, that he 
<A NAME="1029"></A>could not only freely explain what conduct met his approbation, but even 
<A NAME="1030"></A>in some degree enforce his advice, and govern him [Pompey] if he persisted 
<A NAME="1031"></A>in error; that he commanded an army independent of Pompey, so that besides 
<A NAME="1032"></A>his authority, he had strength to compel; and if he did so, all men would 
<A NAME="1033"></A>be indebted to him for the quiet of Italy, the peace of the provinces, 
<A NAME="1034"></A>and the preservation of the empire." These proposals Clodius made to him, 
<A NAME="1035"></A>and for some days at the first appeared to have met with a favorable reception, 
<A NAME="1036"></A>but afterward was not admitted to an audience; for Scipio being reprimanded 
<A NAME="1037"></A>by Favonius, as we found afterward when the war was ended, and the negotiation 
<A NAME="1038"></A>having miscarried, Clodius returned to Caesar.
<A NAME="1039"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 58</B>
<A NAME="1040"></A><BR><BR>Caesar, that he might the more easily keep Pompey's horse inclosed 
<A NAME="1041"></A>within Dyrrachium, and prevent them from foraging, fortified the two narrow 
<A NAME="1042"></A>passes already mentioned with strong works, and erected forts at them. 
<A NAME="1043"></A>Pompey perceiving that he derived no advantage from his cavalry, after 
<A NAME="1044"></A>a few days had them conveyed back to his camp by sea. Fodder was so exceedingly 
<A NAME="1045"></A>scarce that he was obliged to feed his horses upon leaves stripped off 
<A NAME="1046"></A>the trees, or the tender roots of reeds pounded. For the corn which had 
<A NAME="1047"></A>been sown within the lines was already consumed, and they would be obliged 
<A NAME="1048"></A>to supply themselves with fodder from Corcyra and Acarnania, over a long 
<A NAME="1049"></A>tract of sea; and as the quantity of that fell short, to increase it by 
<A NAME="1050"></A>mixing barley with it, and by these methods support their cavalry. But 
<A NAME="1051"></A>when not only the barley and fodder in these parts were consumed, and the 
<A NAME="1052"></A>herbs cut away, when the leaves too were not to be found on the trees, 
<A NAME="1053"></A>the horses being almost starved, Pompey thought he ought to make some attempt 
<A NAME="1054"></A>by a sally.
<A NAME="1055"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 59</B>
<A NAME="1056"></A><BR><BR>In the number of Caesar's cavalry were two Allobrogians, brothers, 
<A NAME="1057"></A>named Roscillus and Aegus, the sons of Abducillus, who for several years 
<A NAME="1058"></A>possessed the chief power in his own state; men of singular valor, whose 
<A NAME="1059"></A>gallant services Caesar had found very useful in all his wars in Gaul. 
<A NAME="1060"></A>To them, for these reasons, he had committed the offices of greatest honor 
<A NAME="1061"></A>in their own country, and took care to have them chosen into the senate 
<A NAME="1062"></A>at an unusual age, and had bestowed on them lands taken from the enemy, 
<A NAME="1063"></A>and large pecuniary rewards, and from being needy had made them affluent. 
<A NAME="1064"></A>Their valor had not only procured them Caesar's esteem, but they were beloved 
<A NAME="1065"></A>by the whole army. But presuming on Caesar's friendship, and elated with 
<A NAME="1066"></A>the arrogance natural to a foolish and barbarous people, they despised 
<A NAME="1067"></A>their countrymen, defrauded their cavalry of their pay, and applied all 
<A NAME="1068"></A>the plunder to their own use. Displeased at this conduct, their soldiers 
<A NAME="1069"></A>went in a body to Caesar, and openly complained of their ill usage; and 
<A NAME="1070"></A>to their other charges added, that false musters were given in to Caesar, 
<A NAME="1071"></A>and the surcharged pay applied to their own use.
<A NAME="1072"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 60</B>
<A NAME="1073"></A><BR><BR>Caesar, not thinking it a proper time to call them to account, 
<A NAME="1074"></A>and willing to pardon many faults, on account of their valor, deferred 
<A NAME="1075"></A>the whole matter, and gave them a private rebuke, for having made a traffic 
<A NAME="1076"></A>of their troops, and advised them to expect every thing from his friendship, 
<A NAME="1077"></A>and by his past favors to measure their future hopes. This however, gave 
<A NAME="1078"></A>them great offense, and made them contemptible in the eyes of the whole 
<A NAME="1079"></A>army. Of this they became sensible, as well from the reproaches of others, 
<A NAME="1080"></A>as from the judgment of their own minds, and a consciousness of guilt. 
<A NAME="1081"></A>Prompted then by shame, and perhaps imagining that they were not liberated 
<A NAME="1082"></A>from trial, but reserved to a future day, they resolved to break off from 
<A NAME="1083"></A>us, to put their fortune to a new hazard, and to make trial of new connections. 
<A NAME="1084"></A>And having conferred with a few of their clients, to whom they could venture 
<A NAME="1085"></A>to intrust so base an action, they first attempted to assassinate Caius 
<A NAME="1086"></A>Volusenus, general of the horse (as was discovered at the end of the war), 
<A NAME="1087"></A>that they might appear to have fled to Pompey after conferring an important 
<A NAME="1088"></A>service on him. But when that appeared too difficult to put in execution, 
<A NAME="1089"></A>and no opportunity offered to accomplish it, they borrowed all the money 
<A NAME="1090"></A>they could, as if they designed to make satisfaction and restitution for 
<A NAME="1091"></A>what they had defrauded: and having purchased a great number of horses, 
<A NAME="1092"></A>they deserted to Pompey along with those whom they had engaged in their 
<A NAME="1093"></A>plot.
<A NAME="1094"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 61</B>
<A NAME="1095"></A><BR><BR>As they were persons nobly descended and of liberal education, 
<A NAME="1096"></A>and had come with a great retinue, and several cattle, and were reckoned 
<A NAME="1097"></A>men of courage, and had been in great esteem with Caesar, and as it was 
<A NAME="1098"></A>a new and uncommon event, Pompey carried them round all his works, and 
<A NAME="1099"></A>made an ostentatious show of them, for till that day, not a soldier, either 
<A NAME="1100"></A>horse or foot had deserted from Caesar to Pompey, though there were desertions 
<A NAME="1101"></A>almost every day from Pompey to Caesar: but more commonly among the soldiers 
<A NAME="1102"></A>levied in Epirus and Aetolia, and in those countries, which were in Caesar's
