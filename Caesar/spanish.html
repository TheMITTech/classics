<BR><A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A>Chapter 1
<A NAME="11"></A><BR><BR>On the defeat of Pharnaces and reduction of Africa, those who escaped 
<A NAME="12"></A>from those battles fled to young Cn. Pompey, who had taken possession of 
<A NAME="13"></A>Further Spain, while Caesar was detained in Italy in exhibiting games. 
<A NAME="14"></A>Pompey began to throw himself on the protection of every state, in order 
<A NAME="15"></A>the more readily to establish the means of defense against him. Accordingly, 
<A NAME="16"></A>with a considerable force which had been collected, partly by entreaty, 
<A NAME="17"></A>partly by force, he began to lay waste the province. Under these circumstances 
<A NAME="18"></A>some states voluntarily sent him supplies, others shut the gates of their 
<A NAME="19"></A>towns against him. If any of these chanced to fall into his hands by assault, 
<A NAME="20"></A>although some citizen in it had deserved well of Cn. Pompey (his father), 
<A NAME="21"></A>yet some cause was alleged against him on account of the greatness of his 
<A NAME="22"></A>wealth, so that, he being dispatched, his fortune might become the reward 
<A NAME="23"></A>of the soldiers. Thus the enemy, being encouraged by a few advantages, 
<A NAME="24"></A>their forces increased much, wherefore those states which were opposed 
<A NAME="25"></A>to Pompey, by continual messages dispatched to Italy, sought protection 
<A NAME="26"></A>for themselves.
<A NAME="27"></A><BR><BR>Chapter 2
<A NAME="28"></A><BR><BR>When Caesar, now a third time dictator, and elected a fourth time, 
<A NAME="29"></A>having already proceeded many marches into Spain with prompt dispatch, 
<A NAME="30"></A>was coming to finish the war, he was met on the way by embassadors from 
<A NAME="31"></A>Corduba, who had deserted Cn. Pompey; these informed him that it would 
<A NAME="32"></A>be an easy matter to make himself master of the town by night, because 
<A NAME="33"></A>the enemy as yet knew nothing of his arrival in the province, as the scouts 
<A NAME="34"></A>sent out by Cn. Pompey to inform him of Caesar's approach had been all 
<A NAME="35"></A>made prisoners. They alleged besides many other very plausible reasons. 
<A NAME="36"></A>He, therefore, immediately sent intelligence of his arrival to Q. Pedius, 
<A NAME="37"></A>and Q. Fabius Maximus his lieutenants, to whom he had left the command 
<A NAME="38"></A>of the troops in the province, ordering them to send him all the cavalry 
<A NAME="39"></A>they had been able to raise. He came up with them much sooner than they 
<A NAME="40"></A>expected, and had not the protection of the cavalry, according to his 
<A NAME="41"></A>desire.
<A NAME="42"></A><BR><BR>Chapter 3
<A NAME="43"></A><BR><BR>Sextus Pompey, the brother of Cneius, commanded at this time at 
<A NAME="44"></A>Corduba, which was accounted the capital of the province. Young Cneius 
<A NAME="45"></A>Pompey himself was employed in the siege of Ulia, which had now lasted 
<A NAME="46"></A>some months. Notice of Caesar's arrival having been received, messengers 
<A NAME="47"></A>having passed Pompey's guards came to him from that town and besought him 
<A NAME="48"></A>to send them relief as soon as possible. Caesar, knowing that this people 
<A NAME="49"></A>had deserved very well of the Romans, detached, about nine o'clock, at 
<A NAME="50"></A>night eleven cohorts, with a like number of horse, under the command of 
<A NAME="51"></A>L. Julius Paciecus, a man known in that province, and also well acquainted 
<A NAME="52"></A>with it. When he arrived at Pompey's quarter, a dreadful tempest arising, 
<A NAME="53"></A>attended with a violent wind, so great a darkness ensued that you could 
<A NAME="54"></A>scarcely have distinguished even the person next you. This accident proved 
<A NAME="55"></A>of great advantage to Paciecus: for being arrived at Pompey's camp, he 
<A NAME="56"></A>ordered the cavalry to advance two by two, and march directly through the 
<A NAME="57"></A>enemy's quarters to the town; one of their guards calling to know who passed, 
<A NAME="58"></A>one of our troopers bade him be silent, for they were just then endeavoring 
<A NAME="59"></A>by stealth to approach the wall, in order to get possession of the town; 
<A NAME="60"></A>and partly by this answer, partly by favor of the tempest, the sentinels 
<A NAME="61"></A>were prevented from examining things diligently. When they reached the 
<A NAME="62"></A>gates, upon a signal being given, they were admitted; and both horse and 
<A NAME="63"></A>foot raising a loud shout, after leaving some troops to guard the town, 
<A NAME="64"></A>sallied in a body upon the enemy's camp. This came upon them so unexpectedly 
<A NAME="65"></A>that the greater number of the men in the camps thought that they were 
<A NAME="66"></A>captured.
<A NAME="67"></A><BR><BR>Chapter 4
<A NAME="68"></A><BR><BR>Ulia being relieved, Caesar, to draw Pompey from the siege, marched 
<A NAME="69"></A>toward Corduba; sending the cavalry before, with a select body of heavy-armed 
<A NAME="70"></A>foot; who, as soon as they came within sight of the place, got up behind 
<A NAME="71"></A>the troopers. By this stratagem they could not possibly be perceived by 
<A NAME="72"></A>those of Corduba. Upon their approach to the walls, the enemy sallied in 
<A NAME="73"></A>great numbers to attack our cavalry; when the infantry, whom we have mentioned 
<A NAME="74"></A>above, leaping down, fell upon them with such fury that out of an almost 
<A NAME="75"></A>infinite multitude of men, very few returned to the town. This so alarmed 
<A NAME="76"></A>Sextus Pompey that he immediately sent letters to his brother, requesting 
<A NAME="77"></A>him to come speedily to his relief, lest Caesar should make himself master 
<A NAME="78"></A>of Corduba before his arrival. Thus Cn. Pompey, moved by his brother's 
<A NAME="79"></A>letters, quitted the siege of Ulia, which was upon the point of surrendering, 
<A NAME="80"></A>and set out toward Corduba.
<A NAME="81"></A><BR><BR>Chapter 5
<A NAME="82"></A><BR><BR>Caesar, arriving at the river Guadalquivir, which he found too 
<A NAME="83"></A>deep to be forded, sank several baskets of stones in it. Thus having formed 
<A NAME="84"></A>a bridge, he transported his troops in three bodies to the camps. As I 
<A NAME="85"></A>have just mentioned, the beams of the bridge stretched over against the 
<A NAME="86"></A>tower in two rows. Pompey, arriving soon after with his troops, encamped 
<A NAME="87"></A>directly over against him. Caesar, to cut off his provisions and communication 
<A NAME="88"></A>with the town, ran a line from his camp to the bridge. Pompey did the same; 
<A NAME="89"></A>so that a struggle arose between the two generals, which should first get 
<A NAME="90"></A>possession of the bridge; and this daily brought on skirmishes, in which 
<A NAME="91"></A>sometimes the one, sometimes the other party had the better. When these 
<A NAME="92"></A>merged into a serious engagement, both sides fought hand to hand; in the 
<A NAME="93"></A>heat of the struggle for this position, owing to the narrowness of the 
<A NAME="94"></A>bridge, they were pressed together, and in their efforts to extend themselves 
<A NAME="95"></A>toward the river-side, many fell headlong. Thus the loss was pretty equal; 
<A NAME="96"></A>for on either side lay heaps of slain, and Caesar for many days used all 
<A NAME="97"></A>possible endeavors to bring the enemy to an engagement on equal terms, 
<A NAME="98"></A>that he might bring the war to a conclusion as soon as 
<A NAME="99"></A>possible.
<A NAME="100"></A><BR><BR>Chapter 6
<A NAME="101"></A><BR><BR>But finding that they carefully avoided a battle, with a view to 
<A NAME="102"></A>which chiefly he had quitted the route of Ulia; he caused great fires to 
<A NAME="103"></A>be lighted in the night, repassed the river with all his forces, and marched 
<A NAME="104"></A>toward Ategua, one of their strongest garrisons. Pompey, being informed 
<A NAME="105"></A>of this by the deserters, on the same day brought back many carriages and 
<A NAME="106"></A>machines by narrow paths, and betook himself to Corduba. Caesar began his 
<A NAME="107"></A>attack upon Ategua, and carried lines quite round the town. Pompey, having 
<A NAME="108"></A>intelligence of this, set out upon his march the same day. In order to 
<A NAME="109"></A>guard against his arrival, Caesar possessed himself of many forts; partly 
<A NAME="110"></A>to shelter his cavalry, partly to post guards of infantry for the defense 
<A NAME="111"></A>of his camp. Pompey's arrival happened at a time when the mist was very 
<A NAME="112"></A>thick, so that he found means, with some cohorts and troops of cavalry, 
<A NAME="113"></A>to hem in a party of Caesar's horse, and fell upon them in such manner 
<A NAME="114"></A>that very few escaped slaughter.
<A NAME="115"></A><BR><BR>Chapter 7
<A NAME="116"></A><BR><BR>The following night Pompey set fire to his camp, passed the river 
<A NAME="117"></A>Rio Salado, and, marching through the valleys, encamped on a rising ground, 
<A NAME="118"></A>between the two towns of Ategua and Ucubis. Caesar cast up a mound and 
<A NAME="119"></A>brought forward his machines, with other preparations which were necessary 
<A NAME="120"></A>for storming the town. The country all around is mountainous, and seems 
<A NAME="121"></A>formed for war, being separated from the plain by the river Rio Salado, 
<A NAME="122"></A>ascending on the side toward Ategua, about two miles from the river. Pompey's 
<A NAME="123"></A>camp was upon these mountains, within view of both towns; he could, however, 
<A NAME="124"></A>send no relief to his friends. He had the emblems and standards of thirteen 
<A NAME="125"></A>legions, but of those on whom he trusted for support two were natives which 
<A NAME="126"></A>had deserted from Trebonius; one was formed out of the Roman colonies in 
<A NAME="127"></A>those parts; and a fourth, belonging to Afranius, he had brought with him 
<A NAME="128"></A>from Africa; the rest were for the most part made up of fugitives and deserters; 
<A NAME="129"></A>in light-armed foot and cavalry we far exceeded him in both courage and 
<A NAME="130"></A>numbers.
<A NAME="131"></A><BR><BR>Chapter 8
<A NAME="132"></A><BR><BR>Another reason why Pompey was enabled to protract the war was that 
<A NAME="133"></A>the country was full of mountains and extremely well adapted to encampments. 
<A NAME="134"></A>For almost the whole province of Further Spain, though of an extremely 
<A NAME="135"></A>fertile soil, and abounding in springs, is nevertheless very difficult 
<A NAME="136"></A>of access. Here too, on account of the frequent incursions of the natives, 
<A NAME="137"></A>all the places remote from great towns, are fortified with towers and castles, 
<A NAME="138"></A>covered as in Africa, not with tiles but with earth, on these they place 
<A NAME="139"></A>sentinels, and their high situation commands an extensive view of the country 
<A NAME="140"></A>on all sides. Nay, the greatest part of the towns of this province are 
<A NAME="141"></A>built on mountains, and places exceedingly strong by nature, the approaches 
<A NAME="142"></A>to which are extremely difficult. Thus sieges are rare and hazardous in 
<A NAME="143"></A>Spain, since it is not easy to reduce their towns by force; as happened 
<A NAME="144"></A>in the present war. For Pompey having established his camp between Ategua 
<A NAME="145"></A>and Ucubis, as related above, and within view of both towns, Caesar possessed 
<A NAME="146"></A>himself of an eminence very conveniently situated, and only about four 
<A NAME="147"></A>miles from his own camp, on which he built a fortress.
<A NAME="148"></A><BR><BR>Chapter 9
<A NAME="149"></A><BR><BR>Pompey, who, from the nature of the ground, was covered by the 
<A NAME="150"></A>same eminence, which was besides at a sufficient distance from Caesar's 
<A NAME="151"></A>quarters, became sensible of the importance of this post; and as Caesar 
<A NAME="152"></A>was separated from it by the river Rio Salado, he imagined that the difficulty 
<A NAME="153"></A>of sending relief would prevent his attempting any thing of that kind in 
<A NAME="154"></A>its defense. Influenced by this belief, he set out about midnight and attacked 
<A NAME="155"></A>the fort, that he might bring assistance to the besieged. Our troops, upon 
<A NAME="156"></A>their approach, setting up a shout, discharged their javelins in great 
<A NAME="157"></A>numbers, and wounded multitudes of men. After this, when those in the camp 
<A NAME="158"></A>began to resist, and when tidings of it was conveyed to the great camps 
<A NAME="159"></A>to Caesar, he set out with three legions, and when he approached them, 
<A NAME="160"></A>many were killed, owing to their trepidation and flight, and a great number 
<A NAME="161"></A>made prisoners. Among these two * * *; and many others, having thrown down 
<A NAME="162"></A>their arms escaped, so that fourscore shields were found.
<A NAME="163"></A><BR><BR>Chapter 10
<A NAME="164"></A><BR><BR>The next day Arguetius arrived from Italy with the cavalry, and 
<A NAME="165"></A>five standards taken from the Saguntines; but was forced to quit his post 
<A NAME="166"></A>by Asprenas, who likewise brought a reinforcement from Italy to Caesar. 
<A NAME="167"></A>The same night Pompey set fire to his camp, and drew toward Corduba. A 
<A NAME="168"></A>king, named Indus, who was bringing some troops to Caesar with a party 
<A NAME="169"></A>of cavalry, following the pursuit of the enemy too briskly, was made prisoner, 
<A NAME="170"></A>and slain by the Spanish legionaries.
<A NAME="171"></A><BR><BR>Chapter 11
<A NAME="172"></A><BR><BR>On the next day, our cavalry pursued those who were employed in 
<A NAME="173"></A>carrying provisions from the town to Pompey's camp, almost to the very 
<A NAME="174"></A>walls of Corduba, and took fifty prisoners besides horses. On the same 
<A NAME="175"></A>day, Q. Marcius, a military tribune in Pompey's army, deserted to us. At 
<A NAME="176"></A>midnight, a keen encounter took place in the town, and they hurled fire 
<A NAME="177"></A>and every means was resorted to by which fire could be cast. When the attack 
<A NAME="178"></A>was ended, C. Fundanius, a Roman knight, quitted the enemy, and came over 
<A NAME="179"></A>to us.
<A NAME="180"></A><BR><BR>Chapter 12
<A NAME="181"></A><BR><BR>On the next day, two Spanish legionaries, who pretended to be slaves, 
<A NAME="182"></A>were made prisoners by a party of our horse; but being brought to the camp, 
<A NAME="183"></A>they were known by the soldiers, who had formerly served under Fabius and 
<A NAME="184"></A>Pedeius, and deserted from Trebonius. No pardon was extended to them, and 
<A NAME="185"></A>they were slaughtered by our troops. At the same time, some couriers, sent 
<A NAME="186"></A>from Corduba to Pompey, entering our camp by mistake, were seized, had 
<A NAME="187"></A>their hands cut off, and then were dismissed. About nine at night, the 
<A NAME="188"></A>besieged, according to custom, spent a considerable time in casting fire 
<A NAME="189"></A>and darts upon our soldiers, and wounded a great number of men. At day-break 
<A NAME="190"></A>they sallied upon the sixth legion, while we were busy at the works, and 
<A NAME="191"></A>began a sharp contest, in which, however, our men got the better, though 
<A NAME="192"></A>the besieged had the advantage of the higher ground. Those who had begun 
<A NAME="193"></A>the attack, being vigorously opposed on our side, notwithstanding all the 
<A NAME="194"></A>inconveniences we fought under, were at length obliged to retire into the 
<A NAME="195"></A>town, with many wounds.
<A NAME="196"></A><BR><BR>Chapter 13
<A NAME="197"></A><BR><BR>On the next day Pompey began a line from the camp to the river 
<A NAME="198"></A>Rio Salado; and a small party of our horse, being attacked by a much larger 
<A NAME="199"></A>body of the enemy, were driven from their post, and three of their number 
<A NAME="200"></A>slain. On the same day, A. Valgius, the son of a senator, whose brother 
<A NAME="201"></A>was in Pompey's camp, mounted his horse and went over to the enemy, leaving 
<A NAME="202"></A>all his baggage behind him. A spy, belonging to Pompey's second legion, 
<A NAME="203"></A>was taken and slain. At the same time, a bullet was shot into the town, 
<A NAME="204"></A>with this inscription: "That he should set up a shield on whatever day 
<A NAME="205"></A>they advanced to storm the town." This encouraging some to hope that they 
<A NAME="206"></A>might scale the walls, and possess themselves of the town without danger, 
<A NAME="207"></A>they fell the next day to sapping them, and threw down a considerable part 
<A NAME="208"></A>of the outward wall. <B> * In this action, being captured and protected 
<A NAME="209"></A>by the townsmen,</B>
<A NAME="210"></A>as if they had been of their own party, they requested Caesar to dismiss 
<A NAME="211"></A>in armor even those who were appointed over the city by Pompey to guard 
<A NAME="212"></A>it. To this Caesar answered, "That it was his custom to give, not accept 
<A NAME="213"></A>of conditions:" which being reported to the garrison, they set up a shout, 
<A NAME="214"></A>and began to pour their darts upon our men from the whole circuit of the 
<A NAME="215"></A>wall; which gave reason to believe that the garrison intended that day 
<A NAME="216"></A>to make a vigorous sally. Wherefore, surrounding the town with our troops, 
<A NAME="217"></A>the conflict was for some time maintained with great violence, and one 
<A NAME="218"></A>of our engines threw down a tower belonging to the enemy, in which were 
<A NAME="219"></A>five of their men, and a boy, whose office it was to observe the 
<A NAME="220"></A>engine.
<A NAME="221"></A><BR><BR>Chapter 14
<A NAME="222"></A><BR><BR>After this Pompey erected a fort on the other side of the Rio Salado, 
<A NAME="223"></A>in which he met with no interruption from our men, and exulted not a little 
<A NAME="224"></A>in the idea of having possessed himself of a post so near us. Also the 
<A NAME="225"></A>following day, extending himself in like manner still further, he came 
<A NAME="226"></A>up with our out-post of cavalry; and charging them briskly, obliged several 
<A NAME="227"></A>squadrons and the light-armed foot to give ground: many of whom, owing 
<A NAME="228"></A>to the smallness of their numbers and their light armor, were trodden down 
<A NAME="229"></A>by the enemy's horse. This passed within view of both camps, and not a 
<A NAME="230"></A>little animated the Pompeians, to see our men pushed so far: but the latter, 
<A NAME="231"></A>being afterward reinforced by a party from our camp, faced about with the 
<A NAME="232"></A>intention of renewing the fight.
<A NAME="233"></A><BR><BR>Chapter 15
<A NAME="234"></A><BR><BR>It invariably happens in encounters of cavalry that when the troopers 
<A NAME="235"></A>dismount to charge the infantry, the match proves unequal, as happened 
<A NAME="236"></A>on the present occasion. For a select body of the enemy's light-armed foot, 
<A NAME="237"></A>coming unexpectedly upon our horse, they alighted to sustain the charge. 
<A NAME="238"></A>Thus in a very little time, from a cavalry it became an infantry engagement, 
<A NAME="239"></A>and again from an infantry changed to a cavalry engagement, in which our 
<A NAME="240"></A>men were driven back to their very lines; but being there reinforced, about 
<A NAME="241"></A>a hundred and twenty-three of the enemy were slain, several forced to throw 
<A NAME="242"></A>down their arms, many wounded, and the rest pursued quite to their camp. 
<A NAME="243"></A>On our side, three were slain, besides twelve foot-soldiers and five troopers 
<A NAME="244"></A>wounded. Toward the evening of the same day, the fight, as usual, was renewed 
<A NAME="245"></A>before the walls: and the enemy having thrown many darts, and a great quantity 
<A NAME="246"></A>of fire from the battlements, proceeded afterward to an action of unexampled 
<A NAME="247"></A>cruelty and barbarity: for in the very sight of our troops they fell to 
<A NAME="248"></A>murdering the citizens, and tumbling them headlong from the walls, as is 
<A NAME="249"></A>usual among barbarians: no parallel to this is to be found in the memory 
<A NAME="250"></A>of man.
<A NAME="251"></A><BR><BR>Chapter 16
<A NAME="252"></A><BR><BR>When night came on, Pompey sent a messenger unknown to us, to exhort 
<A NAME="253"></A>the garrison to set fire to our towers and mound, and make a sally at midnight. 
<A NAME="254"></A>Accordingly, having poured upon us a great quantity of darts and fire, 
<A NAME="255"></A>and destroyed a considerable part of the rampart, they opened the gate 
<A NAME="256"></A>which lay over against and within view of Pompey's camp, and sallied out 
<A NAME="257"></A>with all their forces, carrying with them fascines to fill up the ditch; 
<A NAME="258"></A>hooks and fire to destroy and reduce to ashes the barracks, which the soldiers 
<A NAME="259"></A>had built mostly of reeds to defend them from the winter; and some silver 
<A NAME="260"></A>and rich apparel to scatter among the tents, that while our men should 
<A NAME="261"></A>be employed in securing the plunder, they might fight their way through 
<A NAME="262"></A>and escape to Pompey; who, in expectation that they would be able to effect 
<A NAME="263"></A>their design, had crossed the Rio Salado with his army, where he continued 
<A NAME="264"></A>all night in order of battle, to favor their retreat. But though our men 
<A NAME="265"></A>had no apprehension of this design, their valor enabled them to frustrate 
<A NAME="266"></A>the attempt, and repulse the enemy with many wounds. They even made themselves 
<A NAME="267"></A>masters of the spoil, their arms, and some prisoners, who were put to death 
<A NAME="268"></A>next day. At the same time, a deserter from the town informed us that Junius, 
<A NAME="269"></A>who was employed in the mine when the citizens were massacred, exclaimed 
<A NAME="270"></A>that it was a cruel and barbarous action - "that they had never deserved 
<A NAME="271"></A>such treatment at their hands - for that they had received them in their 
<A NAME="272"></A>temples and their homes - that it was in violation of all hospitality." 
<A NAME="273"></A>He added many things besides, which made such an impression upon the garrison 
<A NAME="274"></A>that they desisted from the massacre.
<A NAME="275"></A><BR><BR>Chapter 17
<A NAME="276"></A><BR><BR>The next day, Tullius, a lieutenant-general, accompanied by C. 
<A NAME="277"></A>Antonius of Lusitania, came to Caesar, and addressed him to this effect: 
<A NAME="278"></A>"Would to Heaven I had been one of your soldiers rather than a follower 
<A NAME="279"></A>of C. Pompey, and given those proofs of valor and constancy in obtaining 
<A NAME="280"></A>victories for you, rather than in suffering for him. The only advantage 
<A NAME="281"></A>we reap from following his banners are wretched applauses; being reduced 
<A NAME="282"></A>to the condition of indigent citizens, and by the melancholy fate of our 
<A NAME="283"></A>country ranked among its enemies; we, who having never shared with Pompey 
<A NAME="284"></A>his good fortune, yet find ourselves involved in his disgrace; and after 
<A NAME="285"></A>sustaining the attack of so many armed legions, employing ourselves day 
<A NAME="286"></A>and night in the works of defense, exposed to the darts and swords of our 
<A NAME="287"></A>fellow-citizens; vanquished, deserted by Pompey, and compelled to give 
<A NAME="288"></A>way to the superior valor of your troops, find ourselves at last obliged 
<A NAME="289"></A>to have recourse to your clemency, and implore that you will not show yourselves 
<A NAME="290"></A>less placable to fellow-citizens, than you have so often been to foreign 
<A NAME="291"></A>nations." "I shall," said Caesar, "prove myself the same to fellow-citizens, 
<A NAME="292"></A>as I have been to conquered nations."
<A NAME="293"></A><BR><BR>Chapter 18
<A NAME="294"></A><BR><BR>The embassadors being dismissed, when Tiberius Tullius arrived 
<A NAME="295"></A>at the gate of the town, and C. Antony did not follow him, he returned 
<A NAME="296"></A>to the gate and laid hold of him, upon which drawing a poniard from his 
<A NAME="297"></A>breast, he wounded him in the hand, and in this condition they both fled 
<A NAME="298"></A>to Caesar. At the same time the standard-bearer of the first legion came 
<A NAME="299"></A>over to our camp, and reported that the day when the skirmish happened 
<A NAME="300"></A>between the horse, no less than thirty-five of his company fell; but it 
<A NAME="301"></A>was not allowed to mention it in Pompey's camp, or so much as own the loss 
<A NAME="302"></A>of one man. A slave, whose master was in Caesar's camp, and who had left 
<A NAME="303"></A>his wife and son in the city, cut his master's throat, and deceiving the 
<A NAME="304"></A>guards, escaped privately to Pompey's camp; whence by means of a bullet, 
<A NAME="305"></A>on which he inscribed his intelligence, Caesar was informed of the preparations 
<A NAME="306"></A>made for the defense of the place. When we had read the inscription, those 
<A NAME="307"></A>who were employed to throw the bullet returning to the city, two Lusitanian 
<A NAME="308"></A>brothers deserted, and informed us that Pompey in a speech made to his 
<A NAME="309"></A>soldiers, had said: "That as he found it impossible to relieve the town, 
<A NAME="310"></A>he was resolved to withdraw in the night from the sight of the enemy, and 
<A NAME="311"></A>retire toward the sea;" to which one answered "that it was better to hazard 
<A NAME="312"></A>a battle than take refuge in flight," but he who said so was instantly 
<A NAME="313"></A>put to death. At the same time some of his couriers were intercepted, who 
<A NAME="314"></A>were endeavoring to get into the town. Caesar sent the letters to the inhabitants, 
<A NAME="315"></A>and ordered one of the messengers begging his life, to set fire to the 
<A NAME="316"></A>townsmen's wooden turret, promising that if he did this he would grant 
<A NAME="317"></A>him all. The enterprise was not without difficulty: he undertook it, however, 
<A NAME="318"></A>but was slain in the attempt. The same night a deserter informed us that 
<A NAME="319"></A>Pompey and Labienus were greatly offended at the massacre of the 
<A NAME="320"></A>citizens.
<A NAME="321"></A><BR><BR>Chapter 19
<A NAME="322"></A><BR><BR>About nine at night, one of our wooden towers, which had been severely 
<A NAME="323"></A>battered by the enemy's engines, gave way as far as the third story. A 
<A NAME="324"></A>sharp encounter ensued under the walls, and the besieged, assisted by a 
<A NAME="325"></A>favorable wind, burned the remaining part of that tower and another. Next 
<A NAME="326"></A>morning a matron threw herself from the wall, and came over to the camp, 
<A NAME="327"></A>reporting, "that the rest of her family had intended the same, but were 
<A NAME="328"></A>apprehended and put to death;" likewise, a letter was thrown over, in which 
<A NAME="329"></A>was written" L. Minatius to Caesar; Pompey has abandoned me; if you will 
<A NAME="330"></A>grant me my life, I promise to serve you with the same fidelity and attachment 
<A NAME="331"></A>I have hitherto manifested toward him." At the same time deputies who had 
<A NAME="332"></A>been sent before to Caesar by the garrison, now waited on him a second 
<A NAME="333"></A>time, offering to deliver up the town next day, upon a bare grant of their 
<A NAME="334"></A>lives: to which he replied, "That he was Caesar, and would perform his 
<A NAME="335"></A>word." Thus, having made himself master of the place, on the nineteenth 
<A NAME="336"></A>of February he was saluted imperator.
<A NAME="337"></A><BR><BR>Chapter 20
<A NAME="338"></A><BR><BR>Pompey, being informed by some deserters that the town had surrendered, 
<A NAME="339"></A>removed his camp toward Ucubis, where he began to build redoubts, and secure 
<A NAME="340"></A>himself with lines. Caesar also decamped and drew near him. At the same 
<A NAME="341"></A>time a Spanish legionary soldier deserting to our camp, informed us that 
<A NAME="342"></A>Pompey had assembled the people of Ucubis, and given them instructions 
<A NAME="343"></A>to inquire diligently who favored his party, who that of the enemy. Some 
<A NAME="344"></A>time after in the town which was taken, the slave, who, as we have related 
<A NAME="345"></A>above, had murdered his master, was apprehended in a mine and burned alive. 
<A NAME="346"></A>About the same time eight Spanish centurions came over to Caesar, and in 
<A NAME="347"></A>a skirmish between our cavalry and that of the enemy, we were repulsed, 
<A NAME="348"></A>and some of our light-armed foot wounded. The same night we took of the 
<A NAME="349"></A>enemy's spies, three slaves and one Spanish soldier. The slaves were crucified, 
<A NAME="350"></A>and the soldier was beheaded.
<A NAME="351"></A><BR><BR>Chapter 21
<A NAME="352"></A><BR><BR>The day following, some of the enemy's cavalry and light-armed 
<A NAME="353"></A>infantry deserted to us; and about eleven of their horse falling upon a 
<A NAME="354"></A>party of our men that were sent to fetch water, killed some and took others 
<A NAME="355"></A>prisoners; among which last were eight troopers. On the next day Pompey 
<A NAME="356"></A>beheaded seventy-four persons supposed to be favorers of Caesar's cause, 
<A NAME="357"></A>ordering the rest who lay under the same suspicion to be carried back to 
<A NAME="358"></A>the town, of whom a hundred and twenty escaped to Caesar.
<A NAME="359"></A><BR><BR>Chapter 22
<A NAME="360"></A><BR><BR>Some time after, the deputies from Bursavola (whom Caesar had taken 
<A NAME="361"></A>prisoners at Ategua, and sent along with his own embassadors to their city, 
<A NAME="362"></A>to inform them of the massacre of the Ateguans, and what they had to apprehend 
<A NAME="363"></A>from Pompey, who suffered his soldiers to murder their hosts, and commit 
<A NAME="364"></A>all manner of crimes with impunity), arriving in the town, none of our 
<A NAME="365"></A>deputies, except such as were natives of the place, durst enter the city, 
<A NAME="366"></A>though they were all Roman knights and senators. But after many messages 
<A NAME="367"></A>backward and forward, when the deputies were upon their return, the garrison 
<A NAME="368"></A>pursued and put them all to the sword, except two who escaped to Caesar, 
<A NAME="369"></A>and informed him of what had happened. Some time after, the inhabitants 
<A NAME="370"></A>of Bursavola, sending spies to Ategua to know the truth of what had happened, 
<A NAME="371"></A>and finding the report of our deputies confirmed, were for stoning to death 
<A NAME="372"></A>him who had been the cause of the murder of the deputies, and were with 
<A NAME="373"></A>difficulty restrained from laying violent hands upon him, which in the 
<A NAME="374"></A>end proved the occasion of their own destruction. For having obtained leave 
<A NAME="375"></A>of the inhabitants to go in person to Caesar and justify himself, he privately 
<A NAME="376"></A>drew together some troops, and when he thought himself strong enough, returned 
<A NAME="377"></A>in the night, and was treacherously admitted into the town, where he made 
<A NAME="378"></A>a dreadful massacre of the inhabitants, slew all the leaders of the opposite 
<A NAME="379"></A>party, and reduced the place to subjection. Soon after, some slaves who 
<A NAME="380"></A>had deserted informed us that he had sold all the goods of the citizens, 
<A NAME="381"></A>and that Pompey suffered none of his soldiers to quit the camp but unarmed, 
<A NAME="382"></A>because, since the taking of Ategua, many despairing of success fled into 
<A NAME="383"></A>Baeturia, having given over all expectation of victory; and that if any 
<A NAME="384"></A>deserted from our camp, they were put among the light-armed infantry, whose 
<A NAME="385"></A>pay was only sixteen asses a day.
<A NAME="386"></A><BR><BR>Chapter 23
<A NAME="387"></A><BR><BR>The day following Caesar removed his camp nearer to Pompey's, and 
<A NAME="388"></A>began to draw a line to the river Salado. While our men were employed in 
<A NAME="389"></A>the work, some of the enemy fell upon us from the higher ground, and as 
<A NAME="390"></A>we were in no condition to make resistance, wounded great numbers. Here, 
<A NAME="391"></A>as Ennius says, "our men retreated a little." This occurrence, so contrary 
<A NAME="392"></A>to our usual custom, being perceived, two centurions of the fifth legion 
<A NAME="393"></A>passed the river, and restored the battle; when, pressing upon the enemy 
<A NAME="394"></A>with astonishing bravery, one of them fell overwhelmed by the multitude 
<A NAME="395"></A>of darts discharged from above. The other continued the combat for some 
<A NAME="396"></A>time, but seeing himself in danger of being surrounded, endeavored to make 
<A NAME="397"></A>good his retreat, but stumbled and fell. His death being known, the enemy 
<A NAME="398"></A>crowded together in still greater numbers, upon which our cavalry passed 
<A NAME="399"></A>the river, and drove them back to their intrenchments; so that, while they 
<A NAME="400"></A>too eagerly desired to slay them within their lines, they were surrounded 
<A NAME="401"></A>by the cavalry and light-armed troops. Many of these would have been captured 
<A NAME="402"></A>alive, had not their valor been pre-eminent, for they were so confined 
<A NAME="403"></A>by the space included in the fortress, that the cavalry could not well 
<A NAME="404"></A>defend itself. Many of our men were wounded in these two encounters, and 
<A NAME="405"></A>among the rest Clodius Aquitius, but as the fight was carried on mostly 
<A NAME="406"></A>from a distance, none of our men fell, except the two centurions who sacrificed 
<A NAME="407"></A>themselves in the cause of glory.
<A NAME="408"></A><BR><BR>Chapter 24
<A NAME="409"></A><BR><BR>Next day both parties withdrawing from Soricaria, we continued 
<A NAME="410"></A>our works. But Pompey, observing that our fort had cut off his communication 
<A NAME="411"></A>with Aspavia, which is about five miles distant from Ucubis, judged it 
<A NAME="412"></A>necessary to come to a battle. Yet he did not offer it upon equal terms, 
<A NAME="413"></A>but chose to draw up his men upon a hill, that he might have the advantage 
<A NAME="414"></A>of the higher ground. In this respect, when both parties were seeking the 
<A NAME="415"></A>superior position, our men anticipating them, drove them into the plain, 
<A NAME="416"></A>which gave us the advantage. The enemy yielded on all hands, and we made 
<A NAME="417"></A>immense havoc among them. The mountain and not their valor protected them; 
<A NAME="418"></A>of which advantage, and of all relief, our men, though few in number, would 
<A NAME="419"></A>have deprived them had not night intervened. Three hundred and twenty-four 
<A NAME="420"></A>light-armed foot, and about a hundred and thirty-eight legionary soldiers 
<A NAME="421"></A>of their number fell, besides those whose armor and spoils we carried off. 
<A NAME="422"></A>Thus the death of the two centurions, which happened the day before, was 
<A NAME="423"></A>fully revenged.
<A NAME="424"></A><BR><BR>Chapter 25
<A NAME="425"></A><BR><BR>The day after, Pompey's cavalry advanced, according to their usual 
<A NAME="426"></A>custom, to our lines; for they only dared venture to draw up on equal ground. 
<A NAME="427"></A>They therefore began to skirmish with our men who were at work, the legionaries 
<A NAME="428"></A>calling out to us at the same time to choose our field of battle, with 
<A NAME="429"></A>a view to make us believe that they desired nothing so much as to come 
<A NAME="430"></A>to blows; upon this our men quitted the eminence where they were encamped, 
<A NAME="431"></A>and advanced a great way into the plain. But none of the enemy had the 
<A NAME="432"></A>boldness to present themselves, excepting Antistius Turpio; who, presuming 
<A NAME="433"></A>on his strength, and fancying no one on our side a match for him, offered 
<A NAME="434"></A>us defiance. Upon this, as is recorded of Memnon and Achilles, Q. Pompeius 
<A NAME="435"></A>Niger, a Roman knight, born in Italy, advanced from our ranks to the encounter. 
<A NAME="436"></A>The fierce air of Antistius having engaged the attention of all, the two 
<A NAME="437"></A>armies drew up to be spectators of the issue of this challenge, and expressed 
<A NAME="438"></A>as much impatience as if the whole fortune of the war had depended upon 
<A NAME="439"></A>it. The wishes on both sides for success were equal to the anxiety and 
<A NAME="440"></A>concern each felt for his own combatant. They advanced into the plain with 
<A NAME="441"></A>great courage, having each a resplendent buckler of curious workmanship. 
<A NAME="442"></A>And doubtless the combat would have been soon decided, had not some light-armed 
<A NAME="443"></A>foot drawn up near the lines, to serve as a guard to the camp because of 
<A NAME="444"></A>the approach of the enemy's horse, which we have before alluded to. * * 
<A NAME="445"></A>* Our horse, in retreating to their camp, being warmly pursued by the enemy, 
<A NAME="446"></A>suddenly faced about with great cries; which so terrified the Pompeians, 
<A NAME="447"></A>that they immediately betook themselves to flight, and retreated to their 
<A NAME="448"></A>camp with the loss of many of their men.
<A NAME="449"></A><BR><BR>Chapter 26
<A NAME="450"></A><BR><BR>Caesar, to reward the valor of the Cassian troop, presented them 
<A NAME="451"></A>with thirteen thousand sesterces, distributed ten thousand more among the 
<A NAME="452"></A>light-armed foot, and gave to the commander of the cavalry five golden 
<A NAME="453"></A>collars. The same day, A. Bebius, C. Flavius, and A. Trebellius, Roman 
<A NAME="454"></A>knights of Asta, with their horses richly caparisoned and adorned with 
<A NAME="455"></A>silver, came over to Caesar, and informed him, that all the rest of the 
<A NAME="456"></A>Roman knights in Pompey's camp, had like them conspired to come and join 
<A NAME="457"></A>him, that, on the information of a slave they had all been seized and cast 
<A NAME="458"></A>into custody; that out of this number they only had escaped. The same day 
<A NAME="459"></A>letters were intercepted, sent by Pompey to Ursao, with the usual greeting, 
<A NAME="460"></A>and stating, "That hitherto he had all the success against the enemy he 
<A NAME="461"></A>could desire, and would have ended the war much sooner than was expected, 
<A NAME="462"></A>could he have brought them to engage him upon equal terms; that he did 
<A NAME="463"></A>not think it advisable to venture new-levied troops on a plain; that the 
<A NAME="464"></A>enemy, depending on our supplies, as yet protract the war for they storm 
<A NAME="465"></A>city after city, thence supplying themselves with provisions: that he would 
<A NAME="466"></A>therefore endeavor to protect the towns of his party, and bring the war 
<A NAME="467"></A>to as speedy an issue as possible: that he would send them a reinforcement 
<A NAME="468"></A>of some cohorts, and that having deprived them of provisions he would necessitate 
<A NAME="469"></A>the enemy to come to an engagement.
<A NAME="470"></A><BR><BR>Chapter 27
<A NAME="471"></A><BR><BR>Some time after, as our men were carelessly dispersed about the 
<A NAME="472"></A>works, a few horse were killed, who had gone to a grove of olives to fetch 
<A NAME="473"></A>wood. Several slave deserted at this time, and informed us that ever since 
<A NAME="474"></A>the action at Soritia on the 7th of March, the enemy had been under continual 
<A NAME="475"></A>alarms, and appointed Attius Varus to guard the lines. The same day Pompey 
<A NAME="476"></A>decamped, and posted himself in an olive-wood over against Hispalis. Caesar, 
<A NAME="477"></A>before he removed, waited till midnight, when the moon began to appear. 
<A NAME="478"></A>At his departure he ordered them to set fire to the fort of Ucubis, which 
<A NAME="479"></A>Pompey had abandoned, and to assemble in the greater camp. He afterward 
<A NAME="480"></A>laid siege to Ventisponte, which surrendered; and marching thence to Carruca, 
<A NAME="481"></A>encamped over against Pompey, who had burned the city, because the garrison 
<A NAME="482"></A>refused to open the gates to him. A soldier who had murdered his brother 
<A NAME="483"></A>in the camp, being intercepted by our men, was scourged to death. Caesar, 
<A NAME="484"></A>still pursuing his march, arrived in the plains of Munda, and pitched his 
<A NAME="485"></A>camp opposite to that of Pompey.
<A NAME="486"></A><BR><BR>Chapter 28
<A NAME="487"></A><BR><BR>Next day as Caesar was preparing to set out with the army, notice 
<A NAME="488"></A>was sent him by his spies, that Pompey had been in order of battle ever 
<A NAME="489"></A>since midnight. Upon this intelligence he ordered the standard to be raised. 
<A NAME="490"></A>Pompey had taken this resolution in consequence of his letter to the inhabitants 
<A NAME="491"></A>of Ursao, who were his firm adherents, in which he told them that Caesar 
<A NAME="492"></A>refused to come down into the plain, because his army consisted mostly 
<A NAME="493"></A>of new-levied troops. This had greatly confirmed the city in its allegiance. 
<A NAME="494"></A>Thus relying on this opinion, he thought that he could effect the whole, 
<A NAME="495"></A>for he was defended by the nature of his situation, and by the position 
<A NAME="496"></A>for defense of the town, where he had his camp: for, as we observed before, 
<A NAME="497"></A>this country is full of hills which run in a continued chain, without any 
<A NAME="498"></A>plains intervening.
<A NAME="499"></A><BR><BR>Chapter 29
<A NAME="500"></A><BR><BR>But we must by no means omit to mention an accident which happened 
<A NAME="501"></A>about this time. The two camps were divided from one another by a plain 
<A NAME="502"></A>about five miles in extent, so that Pompey, in consequence of the town's 
<A NAME="503"></A>elevated position, and the nature of the country, enjoyed a double defense. 
<A NAME="504"></A>Across this valley ran a rivulet, which rendered the approach to the mountain 
<A NAME="505"></A>extremely difficult, because it formed a deep morass on the right. Caesar 
<A NAME="506"></A>had no doubt that the enemy would descend into the plain and come to a 
<A NAME="507"></A>battle, when he saw them in array. This appeared evident to all; the rather 
<A NAME="508"></A>because the plain would give their cavalry full room to act, and the day 
<A NAME="509"></A>was so serene and clear that the gods seemed to have sent it on purpose 
<A NAME="510"></A>to favor the engagement. Our men rejoiced at the favorable opportunity: 
<A NAME="511"></A>some however were not altogether exempt from fear when they considered 
<A NAME="512"></A>that their all was at stake, with the uncertainty of what might be their 
<A NAME="513"></A>fate an hour after. He advanced however to the field of battle, fully persuaded 
<A NAME="514"></A>that the enemy would do the same; but they durst not venture above a mile 
<A NAME="515"></A>from the town, being determined to shelter themselves under its walls. 
<A NAME="516"></A>Our men still continued before them in order of battle; but although the 
<A NAME="517"></A>equality of the ground sometimes tempted them to come and dispute the victory, 
<A NAME="518"></A>they nevertheless still kept their post on the mountain, in the neighborhood 
<A NAME="519"></A>of the town. We doubled our speed to reach the rivulet, without their stirring 
<A NAME="520"></A>from the place where they stood.
<A NAME="521"></A><BR><BR>Chapter 30
<A NAME="522"></A><BR><BR>Their army consisted of thirteen legions; the cavalry was drawn 
<A NAME="523"></A>up upon the wings, with six thousand light-armed infantry and about the 
<A NAME="524"></A>same number of auxiliaries. We had only eighty heavy-armed cohorts, and 
<A NAME="525"></A>eight thousand horse. When we reached the extremity of the plain, the real 
<A NAME="526"></A>seat of disadvantage, the enemy were awaiting us above, so that it would 
<A NAME="527"></A>have been exceedingly dangerous to proceed. When Caesar perceived this, 
<A NAME="528"></A>he pointed out the locality, lest any disagreeable occurrence should result 
<A NAME="529"></A>from the temerity of his troops. The army murmured greatly, as if they 
<A NAME="530"></A>had been kept back from a certain victory, when this was told them. The 
<A NAME="531"></A>delay, however, served to enliven the enemy, thinking that Caesar's troops 
<A NAME="532"></A>shrank from an encounter through fear: they therefore had the boldness 
<A NAME="533"></A>to advance a little way, yet without quitting the advantage of their post, 
<A NAME="534"></A>the approach to which was extremely dangerous. The tenth legion, as usual, 
<A NAME="535"></A>was on the right, the third and fifth on the left, with the auxiliary troops 
<A NAME="536"></A>and cavalry. The battle began with a shout.
<A NAME="537"></A><BR><BR>Chapter 31
<A NAME="538"></A><BR><BR>But though our men were superior to the enemy in courage, the latter 
<A NAME="539"></A>nevertheless defended themselves so well by the advantage of the higher 
<A NAME="540"></A>ground, and the shouts were so loud, and the discharge of darts on both 
<A NAME="541"></A>sides so great, that we almost began to despair of victory. For the first 
<A NAME="542"></A>onset and shout, by which an enemy is most apt to be dismayed, were pretty 
<A NAME="543"></A>equal in the present encounter. All fought with equal valor; the place 
<A NAME="544"></A>was covered with arrows and darts, and great numbers of the enemy fell. 
<A NAME="545"></A>We have already observed that the tenth legion was on the right, which, 
<A NAME="546"></A>though not considerable for the number of men, was nevertheless formidable 
<A NAME="547"></A>for its courage; and so pressed the enemy on that side that they were obliged 
<A NAME="548"></A>to draw a legion from the right wing to reinforce the left, lest we should 
<A NAME="549"></A>come upon their flank; but they fought so bravely that the reinforcement 
<A NAME="550"></A>could not find an opportunity of entering the ranks. Upon this motion, 
<A NAME="551"></A>our cavalry on the left fell upon Pompey's right wing. Meanwhile the clashing 
<A NAME="552"></A>of armor mingled with the shouts of combatants, and the groans of the dying 
<A NAME="553"></A>and the wounded, terrified the new-raised soldiers. On this occasion, as 
<A NAME="554"></A>Ennius says, "they fought hand to hand, foot to foot, and shield to shield;" 
<A NAME="555"></A>but though the enemy fought with the utmost vigor, they were obliged to 
<A NAME="556"></A>give ground, and retire toward the town. The battle was fought on the feast 
<A NAME="557"></A>of Bacchus, and the Pompeians were entirely routed and put to flight; insomuch 
<A NAME="558"></A>that not a man could have escaped, had they not sheltered themselves in 
<A NAME="559"></A>the place whence they advanced to the charge. The enemy lost on this occasion 
<A NAME="560"></A>upward of thirty thousand men, and among the rest Labienus and Attius Varus, 
<A NAME="561"></A>whose funeral obsequies were performed upon the field of battle. They had 
<A NAME="562"></A>likewise three thousand Roman knights killed, partly Italian, partly provincial. 
<A NAME="563"></A>About a thousand were slain on our side, partly foot, partly horse; and 
<A NAME="564"></A>five hundred wounded. We gained thirteen eagles, and several standards, 
<A NAME="565"></A>and emblems of authority, and made seventeen officers prisoners. Such was 
<A NAME="566"></A>the issue of this action.
<A NAME="567"></A><BR><BR>Chapter 32
<A NAME="568"></A><BR><BR>The remains of Pompey's army retreating to Munda, with the intention 
<A NAME="569"></A>of defending themselves in that town, it became necessary to invest it. 
<A NAME="570"></A>The dead bodies of the enemy, heaped together, served as a rampart, and 
<A NAME="571"></A>their javelins and darts were fixed up by way of palisades. Upon these 
<A NAME="572"></A>we hung their bucklers to supply the place of a breastwork, and fixing 
<A NAME="573"></A>the heads of the deceased upon swords and lances, planted them all around 
<A NAME="574"></A>the works, to strike the greater terror into the besieged, and keep awake 
<A NAME="575"></A>in them a sense of our prowess. Amid these mournful objects did they find 
<A NAME="576"></A>themselves shut in, when our men began the attack, which was conducted 
<A NAME="577"></A>chiefly by the Gauls. Young Valerius, who had escaped to Corduba with some 
<A NAME="578"></A>horse, informed Sextus Pompey of what had happened; who, upon receipt of 
<A NAME="579"></A>the mournful news, distributing what money he had about him to the troopers, 
<A NAME="580"></A>left the town about nine at night, under pretense of going to find out 
<A NAME="581"></A>Caesar, to treat of an accommodation. On the other side, Cn. Pompey, attended 
<A NAME="582"></A>by a few horse and foot, took the road to Carteia, where his fleet lay, 
<A NAME="583"></A>and which was about a hundred and seventy miles distant from Corduba. When 
<A NAME="584"></A>he was arrived within eight miles of the place, he sent P. Calvitius his 
<A NAME="585"></A>camp-marshal before, to procure a litter to carry him to the town, as he 
<A NAME="586"></A>found himself unwell. The litter came, and when he entered the town, those 
<A NAME="587"></A>of his party waited on him privately, to receive his orders about the management 
<A NAME="588"></A>of the war. As they assembled round the place in great crowds, Pompey quitting 
<A NAME="589"></A>his litter put himself under their protection.
<A NAME="590"></A><BR><BR>Chapter 33
<A NAME="591"></A><BR><BR>After the encounter, Caesar seeing the circumvallation of Munda 
<A NAME="592"></A>completed, marched to Corduba. Those of the enemy who had escaped the slaughter, 
<A NAME="593"></A>possessing themselves of a bridge, upon the approach of our men, called 
<A NAME="594"></A>out to them with an air of derision - "What! we who are no more than a 
<A NAME="595"></A>handful of men escaped from the battle, shall we be allowed no place of 
<A NAME="596"></A>retreat?" They immediately prepared to defend the bridge. Caesar passed 
<A NAME="597"></A>the river and encamped. Scapula, who had stirred up the freedmen to a revolt, 
<A NAME="598"></A>escaping after the battle to Corduba, when he found himself besieged, assembled 
<A NAME="599"></A>all his followers, ordered a funeral pile to be erected and a magnificent 
<A NAME="600"></A>supper served up; when, putting on his richest dress, he distributed his 
<A NAME="601"></A>plate and money among his domestics, supped cheerfully, anointed himself 
<A NAME="602"></A>several times, and, last of all, ordered one of his freedmen to dispatch 
<A NAME="603"></A>him, and another to set fire to the pile.
<A NAME="604"></A><BR><BR>Chapter 34
<A NAME="605"></A><BR><BR>Caesar had no sooner encamped before the place than a division 
<A NAME="606"></A>arose among the inhabitants, between the parties of Caesar and Pompey, 
<A NAME="607"></A>till the dispute almost reached to our camps. During the contest, some 
<A NAME="608"></A>legions, composed partly of deserters, partly of slaves made free by Pompey, 
<A NAME="609"></A>came and surrendered themselves to Caesar. But the thirteenth legion prepared 
<A NAME="610"></A>to defend the town, and with that view possessed themselves of the walls 
<A NAME="611"></A>and some towers, in spite of all opposition, which obliged the other party 
<A NAME="612"></A>to send deputies to Caesar for aid. Upon this those who had escaped out 
<A NAME="613"></A>of the battle set fire to the place, and our men entering at the same time, 
<A NAME="614"></A>slew about twenty-two thousand of them, besides those who were slain without 
<A NAME="615"></A>the walls; thus Caesar obtained the town. While he was employed in this 
<A NAME="616"></A>siege, those who, as we have said, were blockaded at Munda made a sally, 
<A NAME="617"></A>but were driven back into the town with considerable 
<A NAME="618"></A>loss.
<A NAME="619"></A><BR><BR>Chapter 35
<A NAME="620"></A><BR><BR>Thence Caesar marched to Hispalis, which sent deputies to sue for 
<A NAME="621"></A>pardon. Though the citizens assured him that they were able to defend the 
<A NAME="622"></A>town, he sent Caninius his lieutenant thither with some troops, and encamped 
<A NAME="623"></A>before the place. There was in the town a strong party of Pompeians, who, 
<A NAME="624"></A>displeased to see Caesar's troops received within the walls, secretly deputed 
<A NAME="625"></A>one Philo, a zealous partisan of Pompey, and well known in Lusitania, to 
<A NAME="626"></A>beg assistance of Cecilius Niger, one of the barbarians, who lay encamped 
<A NAME="627"></A>near Lenius, with a strong army of Lusitanians. He is received into the 
<A NAME="628"></A>town of Hispalis by night, surprises the sentinels and garrison, shuts 
<A NAME="629"></A>the gates, and begins to defend the place.
<A NAME="630"></A><BR><BR>Chapter 36
<A NAME="631"></A><BR><BR>During these transactions deputies arrived from Carteia, with accounts 
<A NAME="632"></A>of their having secured Pompey; hoping by this service to atone for their 
<A NAME="633"></A>former fault of shutting their gates against Caesar. Meantime, the Lusitanians 
<A NAME="634"></A>in Hispalis plundered the town, which, though known to Caesar, did not 
<A NAME="635"></A>yet determine him to press it too hard, lest they should in despair set 
<A NAME="636"></A>fire to it, and destroy the walls. It was resolved in council to suffer 
<A NAME="637"></A>the Lusitanians to escape in the night by a sally, yet so that the thing 
<A NAME="638"></A>might not appear designed. In this sally, they set fire to the ships that 
<A NAME="639"></A>were in the river Guadalquivir, and while our men were employed in extinguishing 
<A NAME="640"></A>the flames, endeavored to get off; but being overtaken by the cavalry, 
<A NAME="641"></A>were mostly cut to pieces. Thence Caesar marched to Asta, which submitted. 
<A NAME="642"></A>Munda having been now a long while besieged, many of those who had escaped 
<A NAME="643"></A>out of the battle, despairing of safety, surrendered to us; and being formed 
<A NAME="644"></A>into a legion, conspired among themselves, that upon a signal being given, 
<A NAME="645"></A>the garrison should sally out in the night, while they at the same time 
<A NAME="646"></A>should begin a massacre in the camp. But the plot being discovered, they 
<A NAME="647"></A>were next night, at the changing of the third watch, all put to death outside 
<A NAME="648"></A>the rampart.
<A NAME="649"></A><BR><BR>Chapter 37
<A NAME="650"></A><BR><BR>The Carteians, while Caesar was employed in reducing the other 
<A NAME="651"></A>towns upon his route, began to disagree about young Pompey. One party had 
<A NAME="652"></A>sent the deputies to Caesar, and another was in the Pompeian interest. 
<A NAME="653"></A>These last prevailing, seized the gates, and made a dreadful slaughter 
<A NAME="654"></A>of their adversaries. Pompey himself was wounded in the fray, but escaping 
<A NAME="655"></A>to his ships, fled with about twenty galleys. Didius, who was at Gades 
<A NAME="656"></A>with Caesar's fleet, hearing of what had happened, immediately sailed in 
<A NAME="657"></A>pursuit of them; stationing at the same time some cavalry and infantry 
<A NAME="658"></A>along the coast, to prevent his escaping by land. Pompey had left Carteia 
<A NAME="659"></A>with so much precipitation, that he took no time to furnish himself with 
<A NAME="660"></A>water, and this circumstance obliging him to stop by the way, Didius came 
<A NAME="661"></A>up with him after four days' sailing, took some of his ships, and burned 
<A NAME="662"></A>the rest.
<A NAME="663"></A><BR><BR>Chapter 38
<A NAME="664"></A><BR><BR>With a few friends, Pompey escaped to a place strongly fortified 
<A NAME="665"></A>by nature; of which the troops sent in pursuit of him having certain intelligence 
<A NAME="666"></A>by their scouts, followed day and night. He was wounded in the shoulder 
<A NAME="667"></A>and left leg, and had besides sprained his ankle, all which greatly retarded 
<A NAME="668"></A>his flight, and obliged him to make use of a litter. A Lusitanian having 
<A NAME="669"></A>discovered the place of his retreat, he was quickly surrounded by our cavalry 
<A NAME="670"></A>and cohorts. Seeing himself betrayed, he took refuge in a post fortified 
<A NAME="671"></A>by nature, and which could easily be defended by a few men, the approach 
<A NAME="672"></A>to it being extremely difficult. We attempted to storm it, but were repulsed, 
<A NAME="673"></A>and pursued by the enemy; and meeting with no better success after several 
<A NAME="674"></A>trials, we at length resolved to lay siege to the place, it seeming too 
<A NAME="675"></A>hazardous to force it. Accordingly, a terrace was raised, and lines drawn 
<A NAME="676"></A>round the place; which the enemy perceiving, thought it best to betake 
<A NAME="677"></A>themselves to flight.
<A NAME="678"></A><BR><BR>Chapter 39
<A NAME="679"></A><BR><BR>Pompey as we have observed above being lame and wounded, was in 
<A NAME="680"></A>no condition to make a speedy retreat; and the rather, because the place 
<A NAME="681"></A>was such that he could use neither horse nor litter. Slaughter was dealt 
<A NAME="682"></A>on all hands by our troops, his fortress having been stormed, and his resources 
<A NAME="683"></A>cut off. In this extremity he fled to a cave, where he could not easily 
<A NAME="684"></A>be discovered, unless by the information of the captives. Here he was slain, 
<A NAME="685"></A>his head was brought to Hispalis on the day before the ides of April, and 
<A NAME="686"></A>exhibited before the people when Caesar was at Gades.
<A NAME="687"></A><BR><BR>Chapter 40
<A NAME="688"></A><BR><BR>After the death of young Pompey, Didius, proud of his success, 
<A NAME="689"></A>retired to the nearest fortress and hauled some of his vessels on shore 
<A NAME="690"></A>to be refitted. The Lusitanians, who had escaped from the battle, rallying 
<A NAME="691"></A>in great bodies, advanced to Didius. Though the preservation of the fleet 
<A NAME="692"></A>principally engaged his attention, he was obliged to leave his fort in 
<A NAME="693"></A>order to restrain the frequent sallies of the enemy. These daily skirmishes 
<A NAME="694"></A>gave them an opportunity of projecting an ambuscade; for which purpose 
<A NAME="695"></A>they divided their troops into three bodies. Some were prepared to set 
<A NAME="696"></A>fire to the fleet, and in the mean time others were to come to their relief. 
<A NAME="697"></A>These were so arranged that they could advance to the battle without any 
<A NAME="698"></A>one seeing them. Didius sallied out according to custom; when upon a signal 
<A NAME="699"></A>being given, one of the parties advanced to set fire to the fleet; and 
<A NAME="700"></A>another, counterfeiting a retreat, drew him insensibly into the ambuscade, 
<A NAME="701"></A>where he was surrounded and slain with most of his followers, fighting 
<A NAME="702"></A>valiantly. Some escaped in boats which they found upon the coast; others 
<A NAME="703"></A>endeavored to reach the galleys by swimming; and, weighing anchor, stood 
<A NAME="704"></A>out to sea. A great many saved themselves in this manner, but the Lusitanians 
<A NAME="705"></A>got all the baggage. Caesar meanwhile returned from Gades to 
<A NAME="706"></A>Hispalis.
<A NAME="707"></A><BR><BR>Chapter 41
<A NAME="708"></A><BR><BR>Fabius Maximus, whom he had left to continue the siege of Munda, 
<A NAME="709"></A>conducted it with great zeal; so that the enemy, seeing themselves shut 
<A NAME="710"></A>up on all sides, sallied out, but were repulsed with great loss. Our men 
<A NAME="711"></A>seized this opportunity to get possession of the town, and took the rest 
<A NAME="712"></A>prisoners, in number about fourteen thousand. Thence they retreated toward 
<A NAME="713"></A>Ursao, a town exceedingly strong both by nature and art, and capable of 
<A NAME="714"></A>resisting an enemy. Besides, there is not, within eight miles of the place 
<A NAME="715"></A>any spring but that which supplies the town, which was a decided advantage 
<A NAME="716"></A>to the besieged. In addition to all this, the wood necessary for building 
<A NAME="717"></A>towers and other machines had to be fetched from a distance of six miles. 
<A NAME="718"></A>And Pompey, to render the siege more difficult, had cut down all the timber 
<A NAME="719"></A>round the place, and collected it within the walls, which obliged our men 
<A NAME="720"></A>to bring all the materials for carrying on the siege from Munda, the nearest 
<A NAME="721"></A>town which they had subdued.
<A NAME="722"></A><BR><BR>Chapter 42
<A NAME="723"></A><BR><BR>During these transactions at Munda and Ursao, Caesar, who had returned 
<A NAME="724"></A>from Gades to Hispalis, assembled the citizens, and made the following 
<A NAME="725"></A>speech: "That when he was advanced to the quaestorship, he had chosen their 
<A NAME="726"></A>province in preference to all others, and during his continuance in that 
<A NAME="727"></A>office, had done them every service in his power; that during his praetorship 
<A NAME="728"></A>he had obtained for them from the senate the abolition of the taxes imposed 
<A NAME="729"></A>by Metellus, declared himself their patron, procured their deputies a hearing 
<A NAME="730"></A>at Rome, and made himself many enemies by undertaking the defense both 
<A NAME="731"></A>of their private and public rights. In fine, that when he was consul, he 
<A NAME="732"></A>had, though absent, rendered the province all the services in his power; 
<A NAME="733"></A>that instead of making a suitable return for so many favors, they had always 
<A NAME="734"></A>discovered the utmost ingratitude both toward him and the people of Rome; 
<A NAME="735"></A>as well in this last war as the preceding. "You," says he, "though no strangers 
<A NAME="736"></A>to the law of nations and the rights of Roman citizens, have yet like barbarians 
<A NAME="737"></A>often violated the sacred persons of Roman magistrates. You attempted in 
<A NAME="738"></A>open day, in the public square, to assassinate Cassius. You have been always 
<A NAME="739"></A>such enemies to peace that the senate could never suffer the province to 
<A NAME="740"></A>be without legions. You take favors for offenses, and insults for benefits, 
<A NAME="741"></A>are insolent and restless in peace, and cowardly and effeminate in war. 
<A NAME="742"></A>Young Pompey, though only a private citizen, nay a fugitive, was yet received 
<A NAME="743"></A>among you, and suffered to assume the ensigns of magistracy. After putting 
<A NAME="744"></A>many citizens to death, you still furnished him with forces, and even urged 
<A NAME="745"></A>him to lay waste the country and province. Against whom do you hope to 
<A NAME="746"></A>be victorious? Can you be ignorant that even if I should be destroyed, 
<A NAME="747"></A>the people of Rome have still ten legions, capable not only of opposing 
<A NAME="748"></A>you, but even of pulling down heaven? With whose praises and 
<A NAME="749"></A>virtues
