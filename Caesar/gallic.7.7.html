<A NAME="start"></A>
<A NAME="10"></A><B>Chapter 1</B>
<A NAME="11"></A><BR><BR>Gaul being tranquil, Caesar, as he had determined, sets out for 
<A NAME="12"></A>Italy to hold the provincial assizes. There he receives intelligence of 
<A NAME="13"></A>the death of Clodius; and, being informed of the decree of the senate, 
<A NAME="14"></A>[to the effect] that all the youth of Italy should take the military oath, 
<A NAME="15"></A>he determined to hold a levy throughout the entire province. Report of 
<A NAME="16"></A>these events is rapidly borne into Transalpine Gaul. The Gauls themselves 
<A NAME="17"></A>add to the report, and invent what the case seemed to require, [namely] 
<A NAME="18"></A>that Caesar was detained by commotions in the city, and could not, amid 
<A NAME="19"></A>so violent dissensions, come to his army. Animated by this opportunity, 
<A NAME="20"></A>they who already, previously to this occurrence, were indignant that they 
<A NAME="21"></A>were reduced beneath the dominion of Rome, begin to organize their plans 
<A NAME="22"></A>for war more openly and daringly. The leading men of Gaul, having convened 
<A NAME="23"></A>councils among themselves in the woods, and retired places, complain of 
<A NAME="24"></A>the death of Acco: they point out that this fate may fall in turn on themselves: 
<A NAME="25"></A>they bewail the unhappy fate of Gaul; and by every sort of promises and 
<A NAME="26"></A>rewards, they earnestly solicit some to begin the war, and assert the freedom 
<A NAME="27"></A>of Gaul at the hazard of their lives. They say that special care should 
<A NAME="28"></A>be paid to this, that Caesar should be cut off from his army before their 
<A NAME="29"></A>secret plans should be divulged. That this was easy, because neither would 
<A NAME="30"></A>the legions, in the absence of their general, dare to leave their winter 
<A NAME="31"></A>quarters, nor could the general reach his army without a guard: finally, 
<A NAME="32"></A>that it was better to be slain in battle, than not to recover their ancient 
<A NAME="33"></A>glory in war, and that freedom which they had received from their 
<A NAME="34"></A>forefathers.
<A NAME="35"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 2</B>
<A NAME="36"></A><BR><BR>While these things are in agitation, the Carnutes declare "that 
<A NAME="37"></A>they would decline no danger for the sake of the general safety, and promise" 
<A NAME="38"></A>that they would be the first of all to begin the war; and since they can 
<A NAME="39"></A>not at present take precautions, by giving and receiving hostages, that 
<A NAME="40"></A>the affair shall not be divulged, they require that a solemn assurance 
<A NAME="41"></A>be given them by oath and plighted honor, their military standards being 
<A NAME="42"></A>brought together (in which manner their most sacred obligations are made 
<A NAME="43"></A>binding), that they should not be deserted by the rest of the Gauls on 
<A NAME="44"></A>commencing the war.
<A NAME="45"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 3</B>
<A NAME="46"></A><BR><BR>When the appointed day came, the Carnutes, under the command of 
<A NAME="47"></A>Cotuatus and Conetodunus, desperate men, meet together at Genabum, and 
<A NAME="48"></A>slay the Roman citizens who had settled there for the purpose of trading 
<A NAME="49"></A>(among the rest, Caius Fusius Cita, a distinguished Roman knight, who by 
<A NAME="50"></A>Caesar's orders had presided over the provision department), and plunder 
<A NAME="51"></A>their property. The report is quickly spread among all the states of Gaul; 
<A NAME="52"></A>for, whenever a more important and remarkable event takes place, they transmit 
<A NAME="53"></A>the intelligence through their lands and districts by a shout; the others 
<A NAME="54"></A>take it up in succession, and pass it to their neighbors, as happened on 
<A NAME="55"></A>this occasion; for the things which were done at Genabum at sunrise, were 
<A NAME="56"></A>heard in the territories of the Arverni before the end of the first watch, 
<A NAME="57"></A>which is an extent of more than a hundred and sixty 
<A NAME="58"></A>miles.
<A NAME="59"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 4</B>
<A NAME="60"></A><BR><BR>There in like manner, Vercingetorix the son of Celtillus the Arvernian, 
<A NAME="61"></A>a young man of the highest power (whose father had held the supremacy of 
<A NAME="62"></A>entire Gaul, and had been put to death by his fellow-citizens, for this 
<A NAME="63"></A>reason, because he aimed at sovereign power), summoned together his dependents, 
<A NAME="64"></A>and easily excited them. On his design being made known, they rush to arms: 
<A NAME="65"></A>he is expelled from the town of Gergovia, by his uncle Gobanitio and the 
<A NAME="66"></A>rest of the nobles, who were of opinion, that such an enterprise ought 
<A NAME="67"></A>not to be hazarded: he did not however desist, but held in the country 
<A NAME="68"></A>a levy of the needy and desperate. Having collected such a body of troops, 
<A NAME="69"></A>he brings over to his sentiments such of his fellow-citizens as he has 
<A NAME="70"></A>access to: he exhorts them to take up arms in behalf of the general freedom, 
<A NAME="71"></A>and having assembled great forces he drives from the state his opponents, 
<A NAME="72"></A>by whom he had been expelled a short time previously. He is saluted king 
<A NAME="73"></A>by his partisans; he sends embassadors in every direction, he conjures 
<A NAME="74"></A>them to adhere firmly to their promise. He quickly attaches to his interests 
<A NAME="75"></A>the Senones, Parisii, Pictones, Cadurci, Turones, Aulerci, Lemovice, and 
<A NAME="76"></A>all the others who border on the ocean; the supreme command is conferred 
<A NAME="77"></A>on him by unanimous consent. On obtaining this authority, he demands hostages 
<A NAME="78"></A>from all these states, he orders a fixed number of soldiers to be sent 
<A NAME="79"></A>to him immediately; he determines what quantity of arms each state shall 
<A NAME="80"></A>prepare at home, and before what time; he pays particular attention to 
<A NAME="81"></A>the cavalry. To the utmost vigilance he adds the utmost rigor of authority; 
<A NAME="82"></A>and by the severity of his punishments brings over the wavering: for on 
<A NAME="83"></A>the commission of a greater crime he puts the perpetrators to death by 
<A NAME="84"></A>fire and every sort of tortures; for a slighter cause, he sends home the 
<A NAME="85"></A>offenders with their ears cut off, or one of their eyes put out, that they 
<A NAME="86"></A>may be an example to the rest, and frighten others by the severity of their 
<A NAME="87"></A>punishment.
<A NAME="88"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 5</B>
<A NAME="89"></A><BR><BR>Having quickly collected an army by their punishments, he sends 
<A NAME="90"></A>Lucterius, one of the Cadurci, a man the utmost daring, with part of his 
<A NAME="91"></A>forces, into the territory of the Ruteni; and marches in person into the 
<A NAME="92"></A>country of the Bituriges. On his arrival, the Bituriges send embassadors 
<A NAME="93"></A>to the Aedui, under whose protection they were, to solicit aid in order 
<A NAME="94"></A>that they might more easily resist the forces of the enemy. The Aedui, 
<A NAME="95"></A>by the advice of the lieutenants whom Caesar had left with the army, send 
<A NAME="96"></A>supplies of horse and foot to succor the Bituriges. When they came to the 
<A NAME="97"></A>river Loire, which separates the Bituriges from the Aedui, they delayed 
<A NAME="98"></A>a few days there, and, not daring to pass the river, return home, and send 
<A NAME="99"></A>back word to the lieutenants that they had returned through fear of the 
<A NAME="100"></A>treachery of the Bituriges, who, they ascertained, had formed this design, 
<A NAME="101"></A>that if the Aedui should cross the river, the Bituriges on the one side, 
<A NAME="102"></A>and the Arverni on the other, should surround them. Whether they did this 
<A NAME="103"></A>for the reason which they alleged to the lieutenants, or influenced by 
<A NAME="104"></A>treachery, we think that we ought not to state as certain, because we have 
<A NAME="105"></A>no proof. On their departure, the Bituriges immediately unite themselves 
<A NAME="106"></A>to the Arverni.
<A NAME="107"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 6</B>
<A NAME="108"></A><BR><BR>These affairs being announced to Caesar in Italy, at the time when 
<A NAME="109"></A>he understood that matters in the city had been reduced to a more tranquil 
<A NAME="110"></A>state by the energy of Cneius Pompey, he set out for Transalpine Gaul. 
<A NAME="111"></A>After he had arrived there, he was greatly at a loss to know by what means 
<A NAME="112"></A>he could reach his army. For if he should summon the legions into the province, 
<A NAME="113"></A>he was aware that on their march they would have to fight in his absence; 
<A NAME="114"></A>he foresaw too that if he himself should endeavor to reach the army, he 
<A NAME="115"></A>would act injudiciously, in trusting his safety even to those who seemed 
<A NAME="116"></A>to be tranquilized.
<A NAME="117"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 7</B>
<A NAME="118"></A><BR><BR>In the mean time Lucterius the Cadurcan, having been sent into 
<A NAME="119"></A>the country of the Ruteni, gains over that state to the Arverni. Having 
<A NAME="120"></A>advanced into the country of the Nitiobriges, and Gabali, he receives hostages 
<A NAME="121"></A>from both nations, and, assembling a numerous force, marches to make a 
<A NAME="122"></A>descent on the province in the direction of Narbo. Caesar, when this circumstance 
<A NAME="123"></A>was announced to him, thought that the march to Narbo ought to take the 
<A NAME="124"></A>precedence of all his other plans. When he arrived there, he encourages 
<A NAME="125"></A>the timid and stations garrisons among the Ruteni, in the province of the 
<A NAME="126"></A>Volcae Arecomici, and the country around Narbo which was in the vicinity 
<A NAME="127"></A>of the enemy; he orders a portion of the forces from the province, and 
<A NAME="128"></A>the recruits which he had brought from Italy, to rendezvous among the Helvii 
<A NAME="129"></A>who border on the territories of the Arverni.
<A NAME="130"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 8</B>
<A NAME="131"></A><BR><BR>These matters being arranged, and Lucterius now checked and forced 
<A NAME="132"></A>to retreat, because he thought it dangerous to enter the line of Roman 
<A NAME="133"></A>garrisons, Caesar marches into the country of the Helvii; although mount 
<A NAME="134"></A>Cevennes, which separates the Arverni from the Helvii, blocked up the way 
<A NAME="135"></A>with very deep snow, as it was the severest season of the year; yet having 
<A NAME="136"></A>cleared away the snow to the depth of six feet, and having opened the roads, 
<A NAME="137"></A>he reaches the territories of the Arverni, with infinite labor to his soldiers. 
<A NAME="138"></A>This people being surprised, because they considered themselves defended 
<A NAME="139"></A>by the Cevennes as by a wall, and the paths at this season of the year 
<A NAME="140"></A>had never before been passable even to individuals, he orders the cavalry 
<A NAME="141"></A>to extend themselves as far as they could, and strike as great a panic 
<A NAME="142"></A>as possible into the enemy. These proceedings are speedily announced to 
<A NAME="143"></A>Vercingetorix by rumor and his messengers. Around him all the Arverni crowd 
<A NAME="144"></A>in alarm, and solemnly entreat him to protect their property, and not to 
<A NAME="145"></A>suffer them to be plundered by the enemy, especially as he saw that all 
<A NAME="146"></A>the war was transferred into their country. Being prevailed upon by their 
<A NAME="147"></A>entreaties he moves his camp from the country of the Bituriges in the direction 
<A NAME="148"></A>of the Arverni.
<A NAME="149"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 9</B>
<A NAME="150"></A><BR><BR>Caesar, having delayed two days in that place, because he had anticipated 
<A NAME="151"></A>that, in the natural course of events, such would be the conduct of Vercingetorix, 
<A NAME="152"></A>leaves the army under pretense of raising recruits and cavalry: he places 
<A NAME="153"></A>Brutus, a young man, in command of these forces; he gives him instructions 
<A NAME="154"></A>that the cavalry should range as extensively as possible in all directions; 
<A NAME="155"></A>that he would exert himself not to be absent from the camp longer than 
<A NAME="156"></A>three days. Having arranged these matters, he marches to Vienna by as long 
<A NAME="157"></A>journeys as he can, when his own soldiers did not expect him. Finding there 
<A NAME="158"></A>a fresh body of cavalry, which he had sent on to that place several days 
<A NAME="159"></A>before, marching incessantly night and day, he advanced rapidly through 
<A NAME="160"></A>the territory of the Aedui into that of the Lingones, in which two legions 
<A NAME="161"></A>were wintering, that, if any plan affecting his own safety should have 
<A NAME="162"></A>been organized by the Aedui, he might defeat it by the rapidity of his 
<A NAME="163"></A>movements. When he arrived there, he sends information to the rest of the 
<A NAME="164"></A>legions, and gathers all his army into one place before intelligence of 
<A NAME="165"></A>his arrival could be announced to the Arverni. Vercingetorix, on hearing 
<A NAME="166"></A>this circumstance, leads back his army into the country of the Bituriges; 
<A NAME="167"></A>and after marching from it to Gergovia, a town of the Boii, whom Caesar 
<A NAME="168"></A>had settled there after defeating them in the Helvetian war, and had rendered 
<A NAME="169"></A>tributary to the Aedui, he determined to attack it.
<A NAME="170"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 10</B>
<A NAME="171"></A><BR><BR>This action caused great perplexity to Caesar in the selection 
<A NAME="172"></A>of his plans; [he feared] lest, if he should confine his legions in one 
<A NAME="173"></A>place for the remaining portion of the winter, all Gaul should revolt when 
<A NAME="174"></A>the tributaries of the Aedui were subdued, because it would appear that 
<A NAME="175"></A>there was in him no protection for his friends; but if he should draw them 
<A NAME="176"></A>too soon out of their winter quarters, he might be distressed by the want 
<A NAME="177"></A>of provisions, in consequence of the difficulty of conveyance. It seemed 
<A NAME="178"></A>better, however, to endure every hardship than to alienate the affections 
<A NAME="179"></A>of all his allies, by submitting to such an insult. Having, therefore, 
<A NAME="180"></A>impressed on the Aedui the necessity of supplying him with provisions, 
<A NAME="181"></A>he sends forward messengers to the Boii to inform them of his arrival, 
<A NAME="182"></A>and encourage them to remain firm in their allegiance, and resist the attack 
<A NAME="183"></A>of the enemy with great resolution. Having left two legions and the luggage 
<A NAME="184"></A>of the entire army at Agendicum, he marches to the Boii.
<A NAME="185"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 11</B>
<A NAME="186"></A><BR><BR>On the second day, when he came to Vellaunodunum, a town of the 
<A NAME="187"></A>Senones, he determined to attack it, in order that he might not leave an 
<A NAME="188"></A>enemy in his rear, and might the more easily procure supplies of provisions, 
<A NAME="189"></A>and draw a line of circumvallation around it in two days: on the third 
<A NAME="190"></A>day, embassadors being sent from the town to treat of a capitulation, he 
<A NAME="191"></A>orders their arms to be brought together, their cattle to be brought forth, 
<A NAME="192"></A>and six hundred hostages to be given. He leaves Caius Trebonius his lieutenant, 
<A NAME="193"></A>to complete these arrangements; he himself sets out with the intention 
<A NAME="194"></A>of marching as soon as possible, to Genabum, a town of the Carnutes, who 
<A NAME="195"></A>having then for the first time received information of the siege of Vellaunodunum, 
<A NAME="196"></A>as they thought that it would be protracted to a longer time, were preparing 
<A NAME="197"></A>a garrison to send to Genabum for the defense of that town. Caesar arrived 
<A NAME="198"></A>here in two days; after pitching his camp before the town, being prevented 
<A NAME="199"></A>by the time of the day, he defers the attack to the next day, and orders 
<A NAME="200"></A>his soldiers to prepare whatever was necessary for that enterprise; and 
<A NAME="201"></A>as a bridge over the Loire connected the town of Genabum with the opposite 
<A NAME="202"></A>bank, fearing lest the inhabitants should escape by night from the town, 
<A NAME="203"></A>he orders two legions to keep watch under arms. The people of Genabum came 
<A NAME="204"></A>forth silently from the city before midnight, and began to cross the river. 
<A NAME="205"></A>When this circumstance was announced by scouts, Caesar, having set fire 
<A NAME="206"></A>to the gates, sends in the legions which he had ordered to be ready, and 
<A NAME="207"></A>obtains possession of the town so completely, that very few of the whole 
<A NAME="208"></A>number of the enemy escaped being taken alive, because the narrowness of 
<A NAME="209"></A>the bridge and the roads prevented the multitude from escaping. He pillages 
<A NAME="210"></A>and burns the town, gives the booty to the soldiers, then leads his army 
<A NAME="211"></A>over the Loire, and marches into the territories of the 
<A NAME="212"></A>Bituriges.
<A NAME="213"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 12</B>
<A NAME="214"></A><BR><BR>Vercingetorix, when he ascertained the arrival of Caesar, desisted 
<A NAME="215"></A>from the siege [of Gergovia], and marched to meet Caesar. The latter had 
<A NAME="216"></A>commenced to besiege Noviodunum; and when embassadors came from this town 
<A NAME="217"></A>to beg that he would pardon them and spare their lives, in order that he 
<A NAME="218"></A>might execute the rest of his designs with the rapidity by which he had 
<A NAME="219"></A>accomplished most of them, he orders their arms to be collected, their 
<A NAME="220"></A>horses to be brought forth, and hostages to be given. A part of the hostages 
<A NAME="221"></A>being now delivered up, when the rest of the terms were being performed, 
<A NAME="222"></A>a few centurions and soldiers being sent into the town to collect the arms 
<A NAME="223"></A>and horses, the enemy's cavalry which had outstripped the main body of 
<A NAME="224"></A>Vercingetorix's army, was seen at a distance; as soon as the townsmen beheld 
<A NAME="225"></A>them, and entertained hopes of assistance, raising a shout, they began 
<A NAME="226"></A>to take up arms, shut the gates, and line the walls. When the centurions 
<A NAME="227"></A>in the town understood from the signal-making of the Gauls that they were 
<A NAME="228"></A>forming some new design, they drew their swords and seized the gates, and 
<A NAME="229"></A>recovered all their men safe.
<A NAME="230"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 13</B>
<A NAME="231"></A><BR><BR>Caesar orders the horse to be drawn out of the camp, and commences 
<A NAME="232"></A>a cavalry action. His men being now distressed, Caesar sends to their aid 
<A NAME="233"></A>about four hundred German horse, which he had determined, at the beginning, 
<A NAME="234"></A>to keep with himself. The Gauls could not withstand their attack, but were 
<A NAME="235"></A>put to flight, and retreated to their main body, after losing a great number 
<A NAME="236"></A>of men. When they were routed, the townsmen, again intimidated, arrested 
<A NAME="237"></A>those persons by whose exertions they thought that the mob had been roused, 
<A NAME="238"></A>and brought them to Caesar, and surrendered themselves to him. When these 
<A NAME="239"></A>affairs were accomplished, Caesar marched to the Avaricum, which was the 
<A NAME="240"></A>largest and best fortified town in the territories of the Bituriges, and 
<A NAME="241"></A>situated in a most fertile tract of country; because he confidently expected 
<A NAME="242"></A>that on taking that town, he would reduce beneath his dominion the state 
<A NAME="243"></A>of the Bituriges.
<A NAME="244"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 14</B>
<A NAME="245"></A><BR><BR>Vercingetorix, after sustaining such a series of losses at Vellaunodunum, 
<A NAME="246"></A>Genabum, and Noviodunum, summons his men to a council. He impresses on 
<A NAME="247"></A>them "that the war must be prosecuted on a very different system from that 
<A NAME="248"></A>which had been previously adopted; but they should by all means aim at 
<A NAME="249"></A>this object, that the Romans should be prevented from foraging and procuring 
<A NAME="250"></A>provisions; that this was easy, because they themselves were well supplied 
<A NAME="251"></A>with cavalry, and were likewise assisted by the season of the year; that 
<A NAME="252"></A>forage could not be cut; that the enemy must necessarily disperse, and 
<A NAME="253"></A>look for it in the houses, that all these might be daily destroyed by the 
<A NAME="254"></A>horse. Besides that the interests of private property must be neglected 
<A NAME="255"></A>for the sake of the general safety; that the villages and houses ought 
<A NAME="256"></A>to be fired, over such an extent of country in every direction from Boia, 
<A NAME="257"></A>as the Romans appeared capable of scouring in their search for forage. 
<A NAME="258"></A>That an abundance of these necessaries could be supplied to them, because 
<A NAME="259"></A>they would be assisted by the resources of those in whose territories the 
<A NAME="260"></A>war would be waged: that the Romans either would not bear the privation, 
<A NAME="261"></A>or else would advance to any distance from the camp with considerable danger; 
<A NAME="262"></A>and that it made no difference whether they slew them or stripped them 
<A NAME="263"></A>of their baggage, since, if it was lost, they could not carry on the war. 
<A NAME="264"></A>Besides that, the towns ought to be burned which were not secured against 
<A NAME="265"></A>every danger by their fortifications or natural advantages; that there 
<A NAME="266"></A>should not be places of retreat for their own countrymen for declining 
<A NAME="267"></A>military service, nor be exposed to the Romans as inducements to carry 
<A NAME="268"></A>off abundance of provisions and plunder. If these sacrifices should appear 
<A NAME="269"></A>heavy or galling, that they ought to consider it much more distressing 
<A NAME="270"></A>that their wives and children should be dragged off to slavery, and themselves 
<A NAME="271"></A>slain; the evils which must necessarily befall the conquered.
<A NAME="272"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 15</B>
<A NAME="273"></A><BR><BR>This opinion having been approved of by unanimous consent, more 
<A NAME="274"></A>than twenty towns of the Bituriges are burned in one day. Conflagrations 
<A NAME="275"></A>are beheld in every quarter; and although all bore this with great regret, 
<A NAME="276"></A>yet they laid before themselves this consolation, that, as the victory 
<A NAME="277"></A>was certain, they could quickly recover their losses. There is a debate 
<A NAME="278"></A>concerning Avaricum in the general council, whether they should decide, 
<A NAME="279"></A>that it should be burned or defended. The Bituriges threw themselves at 
<A NAME="280"></A>the feet of all the Gauls, and entreat that they should not be compelled 
<A NAME="281"></A>to set fire with their own hands to the fairest city of almost the whole 
<A NAME="282"></A>of Gaul, which was both a protection and ornament to the state; they say 
<A NAME="283"></A>that "they could easily defend it, owing to the nature of the ground, for, 
<A NAME="284"></A>being inclosed almost on every side by a river and a marsh, it had only 
<A NAME="285"></A>one entrance, and that very narrow." Permission being granted to them at 
<A NAME="286"></A>their earnest request, Vercingetorix at first dissuades them from it, but 
<A NAME="287"></A>afterward concedes the point, owing to their entreaties and the compassion 
<A NAME="288"></A>of the soldiers. A proper garrison is selected for the 
<A NAME="289"></A>town.
<A NAME="290"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 16</B>
<A NAME="291"></A><BR><BR>Vercingetorix follows closely upon Caesar by shorter marches, and 
<A NAME="292"></A>selects for his camp a place defended by woods and marshes, at the distance 
<A NAME="293"></A>of fifteen miles from Avaricum. There he received intelligence by trusty 
<A NAME="294"></A>scouts, every hour in the day, of what was going on at Avaricum, and ordered 
<A NAME="295"></A>whatever he wished to be done; he closely watched all our expeditions for 
<A NAME="296"></A>corn and forage, and whenever they were compelled to go to a greater distance, 
<A NAME="297"></A>he attacked them when dispersed, and inflicted severe loss upon them; although 
<A NAME="298"></A>the evil was remedied by our men, as far as precautions could be taken, 
<A NAME="299"></A>by going forth at irregular times' and by different 
<A NAME="300"></A>ways.
<A NAME="301"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 17</B>
<A NAME="302"></A><BR><BR>Caesar pitching his camp at that side of the town which was not 
<A NAME="303"></A>defended by the river and marsh, and had a very narrow approach, as we 
<A NAME="304"></A>have mentioned, began to raise the vineae and erect two towers: for the 
<A NAME="305"></A>nature of the place prevented him from drawing a line of circumvallation. 
<A NAME="306"></A>He never ceased to importune the Boii and Aedui for supplies of corn; of 
<A NAME="307"></A>whom the one [the Aedui], because they were acting with no zeal, did not 
<A NAME="308"></A>aid him much; the others [the Boii], as their resources were not great, 
<A NAME="309"></A>quickly consumed what they had. Although the army was distressed by the 
<A NAME="310"></A>greatest want of corn, through the poverty of the Boii, the apathy of the 
<A NAME="311"></A>Aedui, and the burning of the houses, to such a degree, that for several 
<A NAME="312"></A>days the soldiers were without corn, and satisfied their extreme hunger 
<A NAME="313"></A>with cattle driven from the remote villages; yet no language was heard 
<A NAME="314"></A>from them unworthy of the majesty of the Roman people and their former 
<A NAME="315"></A>victories. Moreover, when Caesar addressed the legions, one by one, when 
<A NAME="316"></A>at work, and said that he would raise the siege, if they felt the scarcity 
<A NAME="317"></A>too severely, they unanimously begged him "not to do so; that they had 
<A NAME="318"></A>served for several years under his command in such a manner that they never 
<A NAME="319"></A>submitted to insult, and never abandoned an enterprise without accomplishing 
<A NAME="320"></A>it; that they should consider it a disgrace if they abandoned the siege 
<A NAME="321"></A>after commencing it; that it was better to endure every hardship than to 
<A NAME="322"></A>not avenge the names of the Roman citizens who perished at Genabum by the 
<A NAME="323"></A>perfidy of the Gauls." They intrusted the same declarations to the centurions 
<A NAME="324"></A>and military tribunes, that through them they might be communicated to 
<A NAME="325"></A>Caesar.
<A NAME="326"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 18</B>
<A NAME="327"></A><BR><BR>When the towers had now approached the walls, Caesar ascertained 
<A NAME="328"></A>from the captives that Vercingetorix after destroying the forage, had pitched 
<A NAME="329"></A>his camp nearer Avaricum, and that he himself with the cavalry and light-armed 
<A NAME="330"></A>infantry, who generally fought among the horse, had gone to lay an ambuscade 
<A NAME="331"></A>in that quarter, to which he thought that our troops would come the next 
<A NAME="332"></A>day to forage. On learning these facts, he set out from the camp secretly 
<A NAME="333"></A>at midnight, and reached the camp of the enemy early in the morning. They 
<A NAME="334"></A>having quickly learned the arrival of Caesar by scouts, hid their cars 
<A NAME="335"></A>and baggage in the thickest parts of the woods, and drew up all their forces 
<A NAME="336"></A>in a lofty and open space: which circumstance being announced, Caesar immediately 
<A NAME="337"></A>ordered the baggage to be piled, and the arms to be got 
<A NAME="338"></A>ready.
<A NAME="339"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 19</B>
<A NAME="340"></A><BR><BR>There was a hill of a gentle ascent from the bottom; a dangerous 
<A NAME="341"></A>and impassable marsh, not more than fifty feet broad, begirt it on almost 
<A NAME="342"></A>every side. The Gauls, having broken down the bridges, posted themselves 
<A NAME="343"></A>on this hill, in confidence of their position, and being drawn up in tribes 
<A NAME="344"></A>according to their respective states, held all the fords and passages of 
<A NAME="345"></A>that marsh with trusty guards, thus determined that if the Romans should 
<A NAME="346"></A>attempt to force the marsh, they would overpower them from the higher ground 
<A NAME="347"></A>while sticking in it, so that whoever saw the nearness of the position, 
<A NAME="348"></A>would imagine that the two armies were prepared to fight on almost equal 
<A NAME="349"></A>terms; but whoever should view accurately the disadvantage of position, 
<A NAME="350"></A>would discover that they were showing off an empty affectation of courage. 
<A NAME="351"></A>Caesar clearly points out to his soldiers, who were indignant that the 
<A NAME="352"></A>enemy could bear the sight of them at the distance of so short a space, 
<A NAME="353"></A>and were earnestly demanding the signal for action, "with how great loss 
<A NAME="354"></A>and the death of how many gallant men the victory would necessarily be 
<A NAME="355"></A>purchased: and when he saw them so determined to decline no danger for 
<A NAME="356"></A>his renown, that he ought to be considered guilty of the utmost injustice 
<A NAME="357"></A>if he did not hold their life dearer than his personal safety." Having 
<A NAME="358"></A>thus consoled his soldiers, he leads them back on the same day to the camp, 
<A NAME="359"></A>and determined to prepare the other things which were necessary for the 
<A NAME="360"></A>siege of the town.
<A NAME="361"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 20</B>
<A NAME="362"></A><BR><BR>Vercingetorix, when he had returned to his men, was accused of 
<A NAME="363"></A>treason, in that he had moved his camp nearer the Romans, in that he had 
<A NAME="364"></A>gone away with all the cavalry, in that he had left so great forces without 
<A NAME="365"></A>a commander, in that, on his departure, the Romans had come at such a favorable 
<A NAME="366"></A>season, and with such dispatch; that all these circumstances could not 
<A NAME="367"></A>have happened accidentally or without design; that he preferred holding 
<A NAME="368"></A>the sovereignty of Gaul by the grant of Caesar to acquiring it by their 
<A NAME="369"></A>favor. Being accused in such a manner, he made the following reply to these 
<A NAME="370"></A>charges: - "That his moving his camp had been caused by want of forage, 
<A NAME="371"></A>and had been done even by their advice; that his approaching near the Romans 
<A NAME="372"></A>had been a measure dictated by the favorable nature of the ground, which 
<A NAME="373"></A>would defend him by its natural strength; that the service of the cavalry 
<A NAME="374"></A>could not have been requisite in marshy ground, and was useful in that 
<A NAME="375"></A>place to which they had gone; that he, on his departure, had given the 
<A NAME="376"></A>supreme command to no one intentionally, lest he should be induced by the 
<A NAME="377"></A>eagerness of the multitude to hazard an engagement, to which he perceived 
<A NAME="378"></A>that all were inclined, owing to their want of energy, because they were 
<A NAME="379"></A>unable to endure fatigue any longer. That, if the Romans in the mean time 
<A NAME="380"></A>came up by chance, they [the Gauls] should feel grateful to fortune; if 
<A NAME="381"></A>invited by the information of some one they should feel grateful to him, 
<A NAME="382"></A>because they were enabled to see distinctly from the higher ground the 
<A NAME="383"></A>smallness of the number of their enemy, and despise the courage of those 
<A NAME="384"></A>who, not daring to fight, retreated disgracefully into their camp. That 
<A NAME="385"></A>he desired no power from Caesar by treachery, since he could have it by 
<A NAME="386"></A>victory, which was now assured to himself and to all the Gauls; nay, that 
<A NAME="387"></A>he would even give them back the command, if they thought that they conferred 
<A NAME="388"></A>honor on him, rather than received safety from him. That you may be assured," 
<A NAME="389"></A>said he, "that I speak these words with truth; - listen to these Roman 
<A NAME="390"></A>soldiers!" He produces some camp-followers whom he had surprised on a foraging 
<A NAME="391"></A>expedition some days before, and had tortured by famine and confinement. 
<A NAME="392"></A>They being previously instructed in what answers they should make when 
<A NAME="393"></A>examined, say, "That they were legionary soldiers, that, urged by famine 
<A NAME="394"></A>and want, they had recently gone forth from the camp, [to see] if they 
<A NAME="395"></A>could find any corn or cattle in the fields; that the whole army was distressed 
<A NAME="396"></A>by a similar scarcity, nor had any one now sufficient strength, nor could 
<A NAME="397"></A>bear the labor of the work; and therefore that the general was determined, 
<A NAME="398"></A>if he made no progress in the siege, to draw off his army in three days." 
<A NAME="399"></A>"These benefits," says Vercingetorix, "you receive from me, whom you accuse 
<A NAME="400"></A>of treason - me, by whose exertions you see so powerful and victorious 
<A NAME="401"></A>an army almost destroyed by famine, without shedding one drop of your blood; 
<A NAME="402"></A>and I have taken precautions that no state shall admit within its territories 
<A NAME="403"></A>this army in its ignominious flight from this place."
<A NAME="404"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 21</B>
<A NAME="405"></A><BR><BR>The whole multitude raise a shout and clash their arms, according 
<A NAME="406"></A>to their custom, as they usually do in the case of him of whose speech 
<A NAME="407"></A>they approve; [they exclaim] that Vercingetorix was a consummate general, 
<A NAME="408"></A>and that they had no doubt of his honor; that the war could not be conducted 
<A NAME="409"></A>with greater prudence. They determine that ten thousand men should be picked 
<A NAME="410"></A>out of the entire army and sent into the town, and decide that the general 
<A NAME="411"></A>safety should not be intrusted to the Bituriges alone, because they were 
<A NAME="412"></A>aware that the glory of the victory must rest with the Bituriges, if they 
<A NAME="413"></A>made good the defense of the town.
<A NAME="414"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 22</B>
<A NAME="415"></A><BR><BR>To the extraordinary valor of our soldiers, devices of every sort 
<A NAME="416"></A>were opposed by the Gauls; since they are a nation of consummate ingenuity, 
<A NAME="417"></A>and most skillful in imitating and making those things which are imparted 
<A NAME="418"></A>by any one; for they turned aside the hooks with nooses, and when they 
<A NAME="419"></A>had caught hold of them firmly, drew them on by means of engines, and undermined 
<A NAME="420"></A>the mound the more skillfully on this account, because there are in their 
<A NAME="421"></A>territories extensive iron mines, and consequently every description of 
<A NAME="422"></A>mining operations is known and practiced by them. They had furnished, more 
<A NAME="423"></A>over, the whole wall on every side with turrets, and had covered them with 
<A NAME="424"></A>skins. Besides, in their frequent sallies by day and night, they attempted 
<A NAME="425"></A>either to set fire to the mound, or attack our soldiers when engaged in 
<A NAME="426"></A>the works; and, moreover, by splicing the upright timbers of their own 
<A NAME="427"></A>towers, they equaled the height of ours, as fast as the mound had daily 
<A NAME="428"></A>raised them, and countermined our mines, and impeded the working of them 
<A NAME="429"></A>by stakes bent and sharpened at the ends, and boiling pitch and stones 
<A NAME="430"></A>of very great weight, and prevented them from approaching the 
<A NAME="431"></A>walls.
<A NAME="432"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 23</B>
<A NAME="433"></A><BR><BR>But this is usually the form of all the Gallic walls. Straight 
<A NAME="434"></A>beams, connected lengthwise and two feet distant from each other at equal 
<A NAME="435"></A>intervals, are placed together on the ground; these are mortised on the 
<A NAME="436"></A>inside, and covered with plenty of earth. But the intervals which we have 
<A NAME="437"></A>mentioned, are closed up in front by large stones. These being thus laid 
<A NAME="438"></A>and cemented together, another row is added above, in such a manner, that 
<A NAME="439"></A>the same interval may be observed, and that the beams may not touch one 
<A NAME="440"></A>another, but equal spaces intervening, each row of beams is kept firmly 
<A NAME="441"></A>in its place by a row of stones. In this manner the whole wall is consolidated, 
<A NAME="442"></A>until the regular height of the wall be completed. This work, with respect 
<A NAME="443"></A>to appearance and variety, is not unsightly, owing to the alternate rows 
<A NAME="444"></A>of beams and stones, which preserve their order in right lines; and, besides, 
<A NAME="445"></A>it possesses great advantages as regards utility and the defense of cities; 
<A NAME="446"></A>for the stone protects it from fire, and the wood from the battering ram, 
<A NAME="447"></A>since it [the wood] being mortised in the inside with rows of beams, generally 
<A NAME="448"></A>forty feet each in length, can neither be broken through nor torn 
<A NAME="449"></A>asunder.
<A NAME="450"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 24</B>
<A NAME="451"></A><BR><BR>The siege having been impeded by so many disadvantages, the soldiers, 
<A NAME="452"></A>although they were retarded during the whole time by the mud, cold, and 
<A NAME="453"></A>constant showers, yet by their incessant labor overcame all these obstacles, 
<A NAME="454"></A>and in twenty-five days raised a mound three hundred and thirty feet broad 
<A NAME="455"></A>and eighty feet high. When it almost touched the enemy's walls, and Caesar, 
<A NAME="456"></A>according to his usual custom, kept watch at the work, and encouraged the 
<A NAME="457"></A>soldiers not to discontinue the work for a moment: a little before the 
<A NAME="458"></A>third watch they discovered that the mound was sinking, since the enemy 
<A NAME="459"></A>had set it on fire by a mine; and at the same time a shout was raised along 
<A NAME="460"></A>the entire wall, and a sally was made from two gates on each side of the 
<A NAME="461"></A>turrets. Some at a distance were casting torches and dry wood from the 
<A NAME="462"></A>wall on the mound, others were pouring on it pitch, and other materials, 
<A NAME="463"></A>by which the flame might be excited, so that a plan could hardly be formed, 
<A NAME="464"></A>as to where they should first run to the defense, or to what part aid should 
<A NAME="465"></A>be brought. However, as two legions always kept guard before the camp by 
<A NAME="466"></A>Caesar's orders, and several of them were at stated times at the work, 
<A NAME="467"></A>measures were promptly taken, that some should oppose the sallying party, 
<A NAME="468"></A>others draw back the towers and make a cut in the rampart; and moreover, 
<A NAME="469"></A>that the whole army should hasten from the camp to extinguish the 
<A NAME="470"></A>flames.
<A NAME="471"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 25</B>
<A NAME="472"></A><BR><BR>When the battle was going on in every direction, the rest of the 
<A NAME="473"></A>night being now spent, and fresh hopes of victory always arose before the 
<A NAME="474"></A>enemy: the more so on this account because they saw the coverings of our 
<A NAME="475"></A>towers burnt away, and perceived, that we, being exposed, could not easily 
<A NAME="476"></A>go to give assistance, and they themselves were always relieving the weary 
<A NAME="477"></A>with fresh men, and considered that all the safety of Gaul rested on this 
<A NAME="478"></A>crisis; there happened in my own view a circumstance which, having appeared 
<A NAME="479"></A>to be worthy of record, we thought it ought not to be omitted. A certain 
<A NAME="480"></A>Gaul before the gate of the town, who was casting into the fire opposite 
<A NAME="481"></A>the turret balls of tallow and fire which were passed along to him, was 
<A NAME="482"></A>pierced with a dart on the right side and fell dead. One of those next 
<A NAME="483"></A>him stepped over him as he lay, and discharged the same office: when the 
<A NAME="484"></A>second man was slain in the same manner by a wound from a cross-bow, a 
<A NAME="485"></A>third succeeded him, and a fourth succeeded the third: nor was this post 
<A NAME="486"></A>left vacant by the besieged, until, the fire of the mound having been extinguished, 
<A NAME="487"></A>and the enemy repulsed in every direction, an end was put to the 
<A NAME="488"></A>fighting.
<A NAME="489"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 26</B>
<A NAME="490"></A><BR><BR>The Gauls having tried every expedient, as nothing had succeeded, 
<A NAME="491"></A>adopted the design of fleeing from the town the next day, by the advice 
<A NAME="492"></A>and order of Vercingetorix. They hoped that, by attempting it at the dead 
<A NAME="493"></A>of night, they would effect it without any great loss of men, because the 
<A NAME="494"></A>camp of Vercingetorix was not far distant from the town, and the extensive 
<A NAME="495"></A>marsh which intervened, was likely to retard the Romans in the pursuit. 
<A NAME="496"></A>And they were now preparing to execute this by night, when the matrons 
<A NAME="497"></A>suddenly ran out - into the streets, and weeping cast themselves at the 
<A NAME="498"></A>feet of their husbands, and requested of them, with every entreaty, that 
<A NAME="499"></A>they should not abandon themselves and their common children to the enemy 
<A NAME="500"></A>for punishment, because the weakness of their nature and physical powers 
<A NAME="501"></A>prevented them from taking to flight. When they saw that they (as fear 
<A NAME="502"></A>does not generally admit of mercy in extreme danger) persisted in their 
<A NAME="503"></A>resolution, they began to shout aloud, and give intelligence of their flight 
<A NAME="504"></A>to the Romans. The Gauls being intimidated by fear of this, lest the passes 
<A NAME="505"></A>should be pre-occupied by the Roman cavalry, desisted from their 
<A NAME="506"></A>design.
<A NAME="507"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 27</B>
<A NAME="508"></A><BR><BR>The next day Caesar, the tower being advanced, and the works which 
<A NAME="509"></A>he had determined to raise being arranged, a violent storm arising, thought 
<A NAME="510"></A>this no bad time for executing his designs, because he observed the guards 
<A NAME="511"></A>arranged on the walls a little too negligently, and therefore ordered his 
<A NAME="512"></A>own men to engage in their work more remissly, and pointed out what he 
<A NAME="513"></A>wished to be done. He drew up his soldiers in a secret position within 
<A NAME="514"></A>the vineae, and exhorts them to reap, at least, the harvest of victory 
<A NAME="515"></A>proportionate to their exertions. He proposed a reward for those who should 
<A NAME="516"></A>first scale the walls, and gave the signal to the soldiers. They suddenly 
<A NAME="517"></A>flew out from all quarters and quickly filled the walls.
<A NAME="518"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 28</B>
<A NAME="519"></A><BR><BR>The enemy being alarmed by the suddenness of the attack, were dislodged 
<A NAME="520"></A>from the wall and towers, and drew up, in form of a wedge, in the market 
<A NAME="521"></A>place and the open streets, with this intention that, if an attack should 
<A NAME="522"></A>be made on any side, they should fight with their line drawn up to receive 
<A NAME="523"></A>it. When they saw no one descending to the level ground, and the enemy 
<A NAME="524"></A>extending themselves along the entire wall in every direction, fearing 
<A NAME="525"></A>lest every hope of flight should be cut off, they cast away their arms, 
<A NAME="526"></A>and sought, without stopping, the most remote parts of the town. A part 
<A NAME="527"></A>was then slain by the infantry when they were crowding upon one another 
<A NAME="528"></A>in the narrow passage of the gates; and a part having got without the gates, 
<A NAME="529"></A>were cut to pieces by the cavalry: nor was there one who was anxious for 
<A NAME="530"></A>the plunder. Thus, being excited by the massacre at Genabum and the fatigue 
<A NAME="531"></A>of the siege, they spared neither those worn out with years, women, or 
<A NAME="532"></A>children. Finally, out of all that number, which amounted to about forty 
<A NAME="533"></A>thousand, scarcely eight hundred, who fled from the town when they heard 
<A NAME="534"></A>the first alarm, reached Vercingetorix in safety: and he, the night being 
<A NAME="535"></A>now far spent, received them in silence after their flight (fearing that 
<A NAME="536"></A>any sedition should arise in the camp from their entrance in a body and 
<A NAME="537"></A>the compassion of the soldiers), so that, having arranged his friends and 
<A NAME="538"></A>the chiefs of the states at a distance on the road, he took precautions 
<A NAME="539"></A>that they should be separated and conducted to their fellow countrymen, 
<A NAME="540"></A>to whatever part of the camp had been assigned to each state from the 
<A NAME="541"></A>beginning.
<A NAME="542"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 29</B>
<A NAME="543"></A><BR><BR>Vercingetorix having convened an assembly on the following day, 
<A NAME="544"></A>consoled and encouraged his soldiers in the following words: "That they 
<A NAME="545"></A>should not be too much depressed in spirit, nor alarmed at their loss; 
<A NAME="546"></A>that the Romans did not conquer by valor nor in the field, but by a kind 
<A NAME="547"></A>of art and skill in assault, with which they themselves were unacquainted; 
<A NAME="548"></A>that whoever expected every event in the war to be favorable, erred; that 
<A NAME="549"></A>it never was his opinion that Avaricum should be defended, of the truth 
<A NAME="550"></A>of which statement he had themselves as witnesses, but that it was owing 
<A NAME="551"></A>to the imprudence of the Bituriges, and the too ready compliance of the 
<A NAME="552"></A>rest, that this loss was sustained; that, however, he would soon compensate 
<A NAME="553"></A>it by superior advantages; for that he would, by his exertions, bring over 
<A NAME="554"></A>those states which severed themselves from the rest of the Gauls, and would 
<A NAME="555"></A>create a general unanimity throughout the whole of Gaul, the union of which 
<A NAME="556"></A>not even the whole earth could withstand, and that he had it already almost 
<A NAME="557"></A>effected; that in the mean time it was reasonable that he should prevail 
<A NAME="558"></A>on them, for the sake of the general safety, to begin to fortify their 
<A NAME="559"></A>camp, in order that they might the more easily sustain the sudden attacks 
<A NAME="560"></A>of the enemy."
<A NAME="561"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 30</B>
<A NAME="562"></A><BR><BR>This speech was not disagreeable to the Gauls, principally, because 
<A NAME="563"></A>he himself was not disheartened by receiving so severe a loss, and had 
<A NAME="564"></A>not concealed himself, nor shunned the eyes of the people: and he was believed 
<A NAME="565"></A>to possess greater foresight and sounder judgment than the rest, because, 
<A NAME="566"></A>when the affair was undecided, he had at first been of opinion that Avaricum 
<A NAME="567"></A>should be burnt, and afterward that it should be abandoned. Accordingly, 
<A NAME="568"></A>as ill success weakens the authority of other generals, so, on the contrary, 
<A NAME="569"></A>his dignity increased daily, although a loss was sustained: at the same 
<A NAME="570"></A>time they began to entertain hopes, on his assertion, of uniting the rest 
<A NAME="571"></A>of the states to themselves, and on this occasion, for the first time, 
<A NAME="572"></A>the Gauls began to fortify their camps, and were so alarmed that although 
<A NAME="573"></A>they were men unaccustomed to toil, yet they were of opinion that they 
<A NAME="574"></A>ought to endure and suffer every thing which should be imposed upon 
<A NAME="575"></A>them.
<A NAME="576"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 31</B>
<A NAME="577"></A><BR><BR>Nor did Vercingetorix use less efforts than he had promised, to 
<A NAME="578"></A>gain over the other states, and [in consequence] endeavored to entice their 
<A NAME="579"></A>leaders by gifts and promises. For this object he selected fitting emissaries, 
<A NAME="580"></A>by whose subtle pleading or private friendship, each of the nobles could 
<A NAME="581"></A>be most easily influenced. He takes care that those who fled to him on 
<A NAME="582"></A>the storming of Avaricum should be provided with arms and clothes. At the 
<A NAME="583"></A>same time that his diminished forces should be recruited, he levies a fixed 
<A NAME="584"></A>quota of soldiers from each state, and defines the number and day before 
<A NAME="585"></A>which he should wish them brought to the camp, and orders all the archers, 
<A NAME="586"></A>of whom there was a very great number in Gaul, to be collected and sent 
<A NAME="587"></A>to him. By these means, the troops which were lost at Avaricum are speedily 
<A NAME="588"></A>replaced. In the mean time, Teutomarus, the son of Ollovicon, the king 
<A NAME="589"></A>of the Nitiobriges, whose father had received the appellation of friend 
<A NAME="590"></A>from our senate, came to him with a great number of his own horse and those 
<A NAME="591"></A>whom he had hired from Aquitania.
<A NAME="592"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 32</B>
<A NAME="593"></A><BR><BR>Caesar, after delaying several days at Avaricum, and, finding there 
<A NAME="594"></A>the greatest plenty of corn and other provisions, refreshed his army after 
<A NAME="595"></A>their fatigue and privation. The winter being almost ended, when he was 
<A NAME="596"></A>invited by the favorable season of the year to prosecute the war and march 
<A NAME="597"></A>against the enemy, [and try] whether he could draw them from the marshes 
<A NAME="598"></A>and woods, or else press them by a blockade; some noblemen of the Aedui 
<A NAME="599"></A>came to him as embassadors to entreat "that in an extreme emergency he 
<A NAME="600"></A>should succor their state; that their affairs were in the utmost danger, 
<A NAME="601"></A>because, whereas single magistrates had been usually appointed in ancient 
<A NAME="602"></A>times and held the power of king for a single year, two persons now exercised 
<A NAME="603"></A>this office, and each asserted that he was appointed according to their 
<A NAME="604"></A>laws. That one of them was Convictolitanis, a powerful and illustrious 
<A NAME="605"></A>youth; the other Cotus, sprung from a most ancient family, and personally 
<A NAME="606"></A>a man of very great influence and extensive connections. His brother Valetiacus 
<A NAME="607"></A>had borne the same office during the last year: that the whole state was 
<A NAME="608"></A>up in arms; the senate divided, the people divided; that each of them had 
<A NAME="609"></A>his own adherents; and that, if the animosity would be fomented any longer, 
<A NAME="610"></A>the result would be that one part of the state would come to a collision 
<A NAME="611"></A>with the other; that it rested with his activity and influence to prevent 
<A NAME="612"></A>it."
<A NAME="613"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 33</B>
<A NAME="614"></A><BR><BR>Although Caesar considered it ruinous to leave the war and the 
<A NAME="615"></A>enemy, yet, being well aware what great evils generally arise from internal 
<A NAME="616"></A>dissensions, lest a state so powerful and so closely connected with the 
<A NAME="617"></A>Roman people, which he himself had always fostered and honored in every 
<A NAME="618"></A>respect, should have recourse to violence and arms, and that the party 
<A NAME="619"></A>which had less confidence in its own power should summon aid from Vercingetorix, 
<A NAME="620"></A>he determined to anticipate this movement; and because, by the laws of 
<A NAME="621"></A>the Aedui, it was not permitted those who held the supreme authority to 
<A NAME="622"></A>leave the country, he determined to go in person to the Aedui, lest he 
<A NAME="623"></A>should appear to infringe upon their government and laws, and summoned 
<A NAME="624"></A>all the senate, and those between whom the dispute was, to meet him at 
<A NAME="625"></A>Decetia. When almost all the state had assembled there, and he was informed 
<A NAME="626"></A>that one brother had been declared magistrate by the other, when only a 
<A NAME="627"></A>few persons were privately summoned for the purpose, at a different time 
<A NAME="628"></A>and place from what he ought, whereas the laws not only forbade two belonging 
<A NAME="629"></A>to one family to be elected magistrates while each was alive, but even 
<A NAME="630"></A>deterred them from being in the senate, he compelled Cotus to resign his 
<A NAME="631"></A>office; he ordered Convictolitanis, who had been elected by the priests, 
<A NAME="632"></A>according to the usage of the state, in the presence of the magistrates, 
<A NAME="633"></A>to hold the supreme authority.
<A NAME="634"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 34</B>
<A NAME="635"></A><BR><BR>Having pronounced this decree between [the contending parties], 
<A NAME="636"></A>he exhorted the Aedui to bury in oblivion their disputes and dissensions, 
<A NAME="637"></A>and, laying aside all these things, devote themselves to the war, and expect 
<A NAME="638"></A>from him, on the conquest of Gaul, those rewards which they should have 
<A NAME="639"></A>earned, and send speedily to him all their cavalry and ten thousand infantry, 
<A NAME="640"></A>which he might place in different garrisons to protect his convoys of provisions, 
<A NAME="641"></A>and then divided his army into two parts: he gave Labienus four legions 
<A NAME="642"></A>to lead into the country of the Senones and Parisii; and led in person 
<A NAME="643"></A>six into the country of the Arverni, in the direction of the town of Gergovia, 
<A NAME="644"></A>along the banks of the Allier. He gave part of the cavalry to Labienus 
<A NAME="645"></A>and kept part to himself. Vercingetorix, on learning this circumstance, 
<A NAME="646"></A>broke down all the bridges over the river and began to march on the other 
<A NAME="647"></A>bank of the Allier.
<A NAME="648"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 35</B>
<A NAME="649"></A><BR><BR>When each army was in sight of the other, and was pitching their 
<A NAME="650"></A>camp almost opposite that of the enemy, scouts being distributed in every 
<A NAME="651"></A>quarter, lest the Romans should build a bridge and bring over their troops; 
<A NAME="652"></A>it was to Caesar a matter attended with great difficulties, lest he should 
<A NAME="653"></A>be hindered from passing the river during the greater part of the summer, 
<A NAME="654"></A>as the Allier can not generally be forded before the autumn. Therefore, 
<A NAME="655"></A>that this might not happen, having pitched his camp in a woody place opposite 
<A NAME="656"></A>to one of those bridges which Vercingetorix had taken care should be broken 
<A NAME="657"></A>down, the next day he stopped behind with two legions in a secret place; 
<A NAME="658"></A>he sent on the rest of the forces as usual, with all the baggage, after 
<A NAME="659"></A>having selected some cohorts, that the number of the legions might appear 
<A NAME="660"></A>to be complete. Having ordered these to advance as far as they could, when 
<A NAME="661"></A>now, from the time of day, he conjectured they had come to an encampment, 
<A NAME="662"></A>he began to rebuild the bridge on the same piles, the lower part of which 
<A NAME="663"></A>remained entire. Having quickly finished the work and led his legions across, 
<A NAME="664"></A>he selected a fit place for a camp, and recalled the rest of his troops. 
<A NAME="665"></A>Vercingetorix, on ascertaining this fact, went before him by forced marches, 
<A NAME="666"></A>in order that he might not be compelled to come to an action against his 
<A NAME="667"></A>will.
<A NAME="668"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 36</B>
<A NAME="669"></A><BR><BR>Caesar, in five days' march, went from that place to Gergovia, 
<A NAME="670"></A>and after engaging in a slight cavalry skirmish that day, on viewing the 
<A NAME="671"></A>situation of the city, which, being built on a very high mountain, was 
<A NAME="672"></A>very difficult of access, he despaired of taking it by storm, and determined 
<A NAME="673"></A>to take no measures with regard to besieging it before he should secure 
<A NAME="674"></A>a supply of provisions. But Vercingetorix, having pitched his camp on the 
<A NAME="675"></A>mountain near the town, placed the forces of each state separately and 
<A NAME="676"></A>at small intervals around himself, and having occupied all the hills of 
<A NAME="677"></A>that range as far as they commanded a view [of the Roman encampment], he 
<A NAME="678"></A>presented a formidable appearance; he ordered the rulers of the states, 
<A NAME="679"></A>whom he had selected as his council of war, to come to him daily at the 
<A NAME="680"></A>dawn, whether any measure seemed to require deliberation or execution. 
<A NAME="681"></A>Nor did he allow almost any day to pass without testing in a cavalry action, 
<A NAME="682"></A>the archers being intermixed, what spirit and valor there was in each of 
<A NAME="683"></A>his own men. There was a hill opposite the town, at the very foot of that 
<A NAME="684"></A>mountain, strongly fortified and precipitous on every side (which if our 
<A NAME="685"></A>men could gain, they seemed likely to exclude the enemy from a great share 
<A NAME="686"></A>of their supply of water, and from free foraging; but this place was occupied 
<A NAME="687"></A>by them with a weak garrison): however, Caesar set out from the camp in 
<A NAME="688"></A>the silence of night, and dislodging the garrison before succor could come 
<A NAME="689"></A>from the town, he got possession of the place and posted two legions there, 
<A NAME="690"></A>and drew from the greater camp to the less a double trench twelve feet 
<A NAME="691"></A>broad, so that the soldiers could even singly pass secure from any sudden 
<A NAME="692"></A>attack of the enemy.
<A NAME="693"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 37</B>
<A NAME="694"></A><BR><BR>While these affairs were going on at Gergovia, Convictolanis, the 
<A NAME="695"></A>Aeduan, to whom we have observed the magistracy was adjudged by Caesar, 
<A NAME="696"></A>being bribed by the Arverni, holds a conference with certain young men, 
<A NAME="697"></A>the chief of whom were Litavicus and his brothers, who were born of a most 
<A NAME="698"></A>noble family. He shares the bribe with them, and exhorts them to "remember 
<A NAME="699"></A>that they were free and born for empire; that the state of the Aedui was 
<A NAME="700"></A>the only one which retarded the most certain victory of the Gauls; that 
<A NAME="701"></A>the rest were held in check by its authority; and, if it was brought over, 
<A NAME="702"></A>the Romans would not have room to stand on in Gaul; that he had received 
<A NAME="703"></A>some kindness from Caesar, only so far, however, as gaining a most just 
<A NAME="704"></A>cause by his decision; but that he assigned more weight to the general 
<A NAME="705"></A>freedom; for, why should the Aedui go to Caesar to decide concerning their 
<A NAME="706"></A>rights and laws, rather than the Romans come to the Aedui?" The young men 
<A NAME="707"></A>being easily won over by the speech of the magistrate and the bribe, when 
<A NAME="708"></A>they declared that they would even be leaders in the plot, a plan for accomplishing 
<A NAME="709"></A>it was considered, because they were confident their state could not be 
<A NAME="710"></A>induced to undertake the war on slight grounds. It was resolved that Litavicus 
<A NAME="711"></A>should have the command of the ten thousand, which were being sent to Caesar 
<A NAME="712"></A>for the war, and should have charge of them on their march, and that his 
<A NAME="713"></A>brothers should go before him to Caesar. They arrange the other measures, 
<A NAME="714"></A>and the manner in which they should have them done.
<A NAME="715"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 38</B>
<A NAME="716"></A><BR><BR>Litavicus, having received the command of the army, suddenly convened 
<A NAME="717"></A>the soldiers, when he was about thirty miles distant from Gergovia, and, 
<A NAME="718"></A>weeping, said, "Soldiers, whither are we going? All our knights and all 
<A NAME="719"></A>our nobles have perished. Eporedirix and Viridomarus, the principal men 
<A NAME="720"></A>of the state, being accused of treason, have been slain by the Romans without 
<A NAME="721"></A>any permission to plead their cause. Learn this intelligence from those 
<A NAME="722"></A>who have escaped from the massacre; for I, since my brothers and all my 
<A NAME="723"></A>relations have been slain, am prevented by grief from declaring what has 
<A NAME="724"></A>taken place. Persons are brought forward whom he had instructed in what 
<A NAME="725"></A>he would have them say, and make the same statements to the soldiery as 
<A NAME="726"></A>Litavicus had made: that all the knights of the Aedui were slain because 
<A NAME="727"></A>they were said to have held conferences with the Arverni; that they had 
<A NAME="728"></A>concealed themselves among the multitude of soldiers, and had escaped from 
<A NAME="729"></A>the midst of the slaughter. The Aedui shout aloud and conjure Litavicus 
<A NAME="730"></A>to provide for their safety. As if, said he, it were a matter of deliberation, 
<A NAME="731"></A>and not of necessity, for us to go to Gergovia and unite ourselves to the 
<A NAME="732"></A>Arverni. Or have we any reasons to doubt that the Romans, after perpetrating 
<A NAME="733"></A>the atrocious crime, are now hastening to slay us? Therefore, if there 
<A NAME="734"></A>be any spirit in us, let us avenge the death of those who have perished 
<A NAME="735"></A>in a most unworthy manner, and let us slay these robbers." He points to 
<A NAME="736"></A>the Roman citizens, who had accompanied them, in reliance on his protection. 
<A NAME="737"></A>He immediately seizes a great quantity of corn and provisions, cruelly 
<A NAME="738"></A>tortures them, and then puts them to death, sends messengers throughout 
<A NAME="739"></A>the entire state of the Aedui, and rouses them completely by the same falsehood 
<A NAME="740"></A>concerning the slaughter of their knights and nobles; he earnestly advises 
<A NAME="741"></A>them to avenge, in the same manner as he did, the wrongs, which they had 
<A NAME="742"></A>received.
<A NAME="743"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 39</B>
<A NAME="744"></A><BR><BR>Eporedirix, the Aeduan , a young man born in the highest rank and 
<A NAME="745"></A>possessing very great influence at home, and, along with Viridomarus, of 
<A NAME="746"></A>equal age and influence, but of inferior birth, whom Caesar had raised 
<A NAME="747"></A>from a humble position to the highest rank, on being recommended to him 
<A NAME="748"></A>by Divitiacus, had come in the number of horse, being summoned by Caesar 
<A NAME="749"></A>by name. These had a dispute with each other for precedence, and in the 
<A NAME="750"></A>struggle between the magistrates they had contended with their utmost efforts, 
<A NAME="751"></A>the one for Convictolitanis, the other for Cotus. Of these Eporedirix, 
<A NAME="752"></A>on learning the design of Litavicus, lays the matter before Caesar almost 
<A NAME="753"></A>at midnight; he entreats that Caesar should not suffer their state to swerve 
<A NAME="754"></A>from the alliance with the Roman people, owing to the depraved counsels 
<A NAME="755"></A>of a few young men which he foresaw would be the consequence if so many 
<A NAME="756"></A>thousand men should unite themselves to the enemy, as their relations could 
<A NAME="757"></A>not neglect their safety, nor the state regard it as a matter of slight 
<A NAME="758"></A>importance.
<A NAME="759"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 40</B>
<A NAME="760"></A><BR><BR>Caesar felt great anxiety on this intelligence, because he had 
<A NAME="761"></A>always especially indulged the state of the Aedui, and, without any hesitation, 
<A NAME="762"></A>draws out from the camp four light-armed legions and all the cavalry: nor 
<A NAME="763"></A>had he time, at such a crisis, to contract the camp, because the affair 
<A NAME="764"></A>seemed to depend upon dispatch. He leaves Caius Fabius, his lieutenant, 
<A NAME="765"></A>with two legions to guard the camp. When he ordered the brothers of Litavicus 
<A NAME="766"></A>to be arrested, he discovers that they had fled a short time before to 
<A NAME="767"></A>the camp of the enemy. He encouraged his soldiers "not to be disheartened 
<A NAME="768"></A>by the labor of the journey on such a necessary occasion," and, after advancing 
<A NAME="769"></A>twenty-five miles, all being most eager, he came in sight of the army of 
<A NAME="770"></A>the Aedui, and, by sending on his cavalry, retards and impedes their march; 
<A NAME="771"></A>he then issues strict orders to all his soldiers to kill no one. He commands 
<A NAME="772"></A>Eporedirix and Viridomarus, who they thought were killed, to move among 
<A NAME="773"></A>the cavalry and address their friends. When they were recognized and the 
<A NAME="774"></A>treachery of Litavicus discovered, the Aedui began to extend their hands 
<A NAME="775"></A>to intimate submission, and, laying down their arms, to deprecate death. 
<A NAME="776"></A>Litavicus, with his clansmen, who after the custom of the Gauls consider 
<A NAME="777"></A>it a crime to desert their patrons, even in extreme misfortune, flees forth 
<A NAME="778"></A>to Gergovia.
<A NAME="779"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 41</B>
<A NAME="780"></A><BR><BR>Caesar, after sending messengers to the state of the Aedui, to 
<A NAME="781"></A>inform them that they whom he could have put to death by the right of war 
<A NAME="782"></A>were spared through his kindness, and after giving three hours of the night 
<A NAME="783"></A>to his army for his repose, directed his march to Gergovia. Almost in the 
<A NAME="784"></A>middle of the journey, a party of horse that were sent by Fabius stated 
<A NAME="785"></A>in how great danger matters were, they inform him that the camp was attacked 
<A NAME="786"></A>by a very powerful army, while fresh men were frequently relieving the 
<A NAME="787"></A>wearied, and exhausting our soldiers by the incessant toil, since on account 
<A NAME="788"></A>of the size of the camp, they had constantly to remain on the rampart; 
<A NAME="789"></A>that many had been wounded by the immense number of arrows and all kinds 
<A NAME="790"></A>of missiles; that the engines were of great service in withstanding them; 
<A NAME="791"></A>that Fabius, at their departure, leaving only two gates open, was blocking 
<A NAME="792"></A>up the rest, and was adding breast-works to the ramparts, and was preparing 
<A NAME="793"></A>himself for a similar casualty on the following day. Caesar, after receiving 
<A NAME="794"></A>this information, reached the camp before sunrise owing to the very great 
<A NAME="795"></A>zeal of his soldiers.
<A NAME="796"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 42</B>
<A NAME="797"></A><BR><BR>While these things are going on at Gergovia, the Aedui, on receiving 
<A NAME="798"></A>the first announcements from Litavicus, leave themselves no time to ascertain 
<A NAME="799"></A>the truth of those statements. Some are stimulated by avarice, others by 
<A NAME="800"></A>revenge and credulity, which is an innate propensity in that race of men 
<A NAME="801"></A>to such a degree that they consider a slight rumor as an ascertained fact. 
<A NAME="802"></A>They plunder the property of the Roman citizens, and either massacre them 
<A NAME="803"></A>or drag them away to slavery. Convictolitanis increases the evil state 
<A NAME="804"></A>of affairs, and goads on the people to fury, that by the commission of 
<A NAME="805"></A>some outrage they may be ashamed to return to propriety. They entice from 
<A NAME="806"></A>the town of Cabillonus, by a promise of safety, Marcus Aristius, a military 
<A NAME="807"></A>tribune, who was on his march to his legion; they compel those who had 
<A NAME="808"></A>settled there for the purpose of trading to do the same. By constantly 
<A NAME="809"></A>attacking them on their march they strip them of all their baggage; they 
<A NAME="810"></A>besiege day and night those that resisted; when many were slain on both 
<A NAME="811"></A>sides, they excite a great number to arms.
<A NAME="812"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 43</B>
<A NAME="813"></A><BR><BR>In the mean time, when intelligence was brought that all their 
<A NAME="814"></A>soldiers were in Caesar's power, they run in a body to Aristius; they assure 
<A NAME="815"></A>him that nothing had been done by public authority; they order an inquiry 
<A NAME="816"></A>to be made about the plundered property; they confiscate the property of 
<A NAME="817"></A>Litavicus and his brothers; they send embassadors to Caesar for the purpose 
<A NAME="818"></A>of clearing themselves. They do all this with a view to recover their soldiers; 
<A NAME="819"></A>but being contaminated by guilt, and charmed by the gains arising from 
<A NAME="820"></A>the plundered property, as that act was shared in by many, and being tempted 
<A NAME="821"></A>by the fear of punishment, they began to form plans of war and stir up 
<A NAME="822"></A>the other states by embassies. Although Caesar was aware of this proceeding, 
<A NAME="823"></A>yet he addresses the embassadors with as much mildness as he can: "That 
<A NAME="824"></A>he did not think worse of the state on account of the ignorance and fickleness 
<A NAME="825"></A>of the mob, nor would diminish his regard for the Aedui." He himself, fearing 
<A NAME="826"></A>a greater commotion in Gaul, in order to prevent his being surrounded by 
<A NAME="827"></A>all the states, began to form plans as to the manner in which he should 
<A NAME="828"></A>return from Gergovia and again concentrate his forces, lest a departure 
<A NAME="829"></A>arising from the fear of a revolt should seem like a 
<A NAME="830"></A>flight.
<A NAME="831"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 44</B>
<A NAME="832"></A><BR><BR>While he was considering these things an opportunity of acting 
<A NAME="833"></A>successfully seemed to offer. For, when he had come into the smaller camp 
<A NAME="834"></A>for the purpose of securing the works, he noticed that the hill in the 
<A NAME="835"></A>possession of the enemy was stripped of men, although, on the former days, 
<A NAME="836"></A>it could scarcely be seen on account of the numbers on it. Being astonished, 
<A NAME="837"></A>he inquires the reason of it from the deserters, a great number of whom 
<A NAME="838"></A>flocked to him daily. They all concurred in asserting, what Caesar himself 
<A NAME="839"></A>had already ascertained by his scouts, that the back of that hill was almost 
<A NAME="840"></A>level; but likewise woody and narrow, by which there was a pass to the 
<A NAME="841"></A>other side of the town; that they had serious apprehensions for this place, 
<A NAME="842"></A>and had no other idea, on the occupation of one hill by the Romans, than 
<A NAME="843"></A>that, if they should lose the other, they would be almost surrounded, and 
<A NAME="844"></A>cut off from all egress and foraging; that they were all summoned by Vercingetorix 
<A NAME="845"></A>to fortify this place.
<A NAME="846"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 45</B>
<A NAME="847"></A><BR><BR>Caesar, on being informed of this circumstance, sends several troops 
<A NAME="848"></A>of horse to the place immediately after midnight; he orders them to range 
<A NAME="849"></A>in every quarter with more tumult than usual. At dawn he orders a large 
<A NAME="850"></A>quantity of baggage to be drawn out of the camp, and the muleteers with 
<A NAME="851"></A>helmets, in the appearance and guise of horsemen, to ride round the hills. 
<A NAME="852"></A>To these he adds a few cavalry, with instructions to range more widely 
<A NAME="853"></A>to make a show. He orders them all to seek the same quarter by a long circuit; 
<A NAME="854"></A>these proceedings were seen at a distance from the town, as Gergovia commanded 
<A NAME="855"></A>a view of the camp, nor could the Gauls ascertain at so great a distance, 
<A NAME="856"></A>what certainty there was in the maneuver. He sends one legion to the same 
<A NAME="857"></A>hill, and after it had marched a little, stations it in the lower ground, 
<A NAME="858"></A>and congeals it in the woods. The suspicion of the Gauls are increased, 
<A NAME="859"></A>and all their forces are marched to that place to defend it. Caesar, having 
<A NAME="860"></A>perceived the camp of the enemy deserted, covers the military insignia 
<A NAME="861"></A>of his men, conceals the standards, and transfers his soldiers in small 
<A NAME="862"></A>bodies from the greater to the less camp, and points out to the lieutenants 
<A NAME="863"></A>whom he had placed in command over the respective legions, what he should 
<A NAME="864"></A>wish to be done; he particularly advises them to restrain their men from 
<A NAME="865"></A>advancing too far, through their desire of fighting, or their hope of plunder, 
<A NAME="866"></A>he sets before them what disadvantages the unfavorable nature of the ground 
<A NAME="867"></A>carries with it; that they could be assisted by dispatch alone: that success 
<A NAME="868"></A>depended on a surprise, and not on a battle. After stating these particulars, 
<A NAME="869"></A>he gives the signal for action, and detaches the Aedui at the same time 
<A NAME="870"></A>by another ascent on the right.
<A NAME="871"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 46</B>
<A NAME="872"></A><BR><BR>The town wall was 1200 paces distant from the plain and foot of 
<A NAME="873"></A>the ascent, in a straight line, if no gap intervened; whatever circuit 
<A NAME="874"></A>was added to this ascent, to make the hill easy, increased the length of 
<A NAME="875"></A>the route. But almost in the middle of the hill, the Gauls had previously 
<A NAME="876"></A>built a wall six feet high, made of large stones, and extending in length 
<A NAME="877"></A>as far as the nature of the ground permitted, as a barrier to retard the 
<A NAME="878"></A>advance of our men; and leaving all the lower space empty, they had filled 
<A NAME="879"></A>the upper part of the hill, as far as the wall of the town, with their 
<A NAME="880"></A>camps very close to one another. The soldiers, on the signal being given, 
<A NAME="881"></A>quickly advance to this fortification, and passing over it, make themselves 
<A NAME="882"></A>masters of the separate camps. And so great was their activity in taking 
<A NAME="883"></A>the camps, that Teutomarus, the king of the Nitiobriges, being suddenly 
<A NAME="884"></A>surprised in his tent, as he had gone to rest at noon, with difficulty 
<A NAME="885"></A>escaped from the hands of the plunderers, with the upper part of his person 
<A NAME="886"></A>naked, and his horse wounded.
<A NAME="887"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 47</B>
<A NAME="888"></A><BR><BR>Caesar, having accomplished the object which he had in view, ordered 
<A NAME="889"></A>the signal to be sounded for a retreat; and the soldiers of the tenth legion, 
<A NAME="890"></A>by which he was then accompanied, halted. But the soldiers of the other 
<A NAME="891"></A>legions, not hearing the sound of the trumpet, because there was a very 
<A NAME="892"></A>large valley between them, were however kept back by the tribunes of the 
<A NAME="893"></A>soldiers and the lieutenants, according to Caesar's orders; but being animated 
<A NAME="894"></A>by the prospect of speedy victory, and the flight of the enemy, and the 
<A NAME="895"></A>favorable battles of former periods, they thought nothing so difficult 
<A NAME="896"></A>that their bravery could not accomplish it; nor did they put an end to 
<A NAME="897"></A>the pursuit, until they drew nigh to the wall of the town and the gates. 
<A NAME="898"></A>But then, when a shout arose in every quarter of the city, those who were 
<A NAME="899"></A>at a distance being alarmed by the sudden tumult, fled hastily from the 
<A NAME="900"></A>town, since they thought that the enemy were within the gates. The matrons 
<A NAME="901"></A>begin to cast their clothes and silver over the wall, and bending over 
<A NAME="902"></A>as far as the lower part of the bosom, with outstretched hands beseech 
<A NAME="903"></A>the Romans to spare them, and not to sacrifice to their resentment even 
<A NAME="904"></A>women and children, as they had done at Avaricum. Some of them let themselves 
<A NAME="905"></A>down from the walls by their hands, and surrendered to our soldiers. Lucius 
<A NAME="906"></A>Fabius a centurion of the eighth legion, who, it was ascertained, had said 
<A NAME="907"></A>that day among his fellow soldiers that he was excited by the plunder of 
<A NAME="908"></A>Avaricum, and would not allow any one to mount the wall before him, finding 
<A NAME="909"></A>three men of his own company, and being raised up by them, scaled the wall. 
<A NAME="910"></A>He himself, in turn, taking hold of them one by one drew them up to the 
<A NAME="911"></A>wall.
<A NAME="912"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 48</B>
<A NAME="913"></A><BR><BR>In the mean time those who had gone to the other part of the town 
<A NAME="914"></A>to defend it, as we have mentioned above, at first, aroused by hearing 
<A NAME="915"></A>the shouts, and, afterward, by frequent accounts, that the town was in 
<A NAME="916"></A>possession of the Romans, sent forward their cavalry, and hastened in larger 
<A NAME="917"></A>numbers to that quarter. As each first came he stood beneath the wall, 
<A NAME="918"></A>and increased the number of his countrymen engaged in action. When a great 
<A NAME="919"></A>multitude of them had assembled, the matrons, who a little before were 
<A NAME="920"></A>stretching their hands from the walls to the Romans, began to beseech their 
<A NAME="921"></A>countrymen, and after the Gallic fashion to show their disheveled hair, 
<A NAME="922"></A>and bring their children into public view. Neither in position nor in numbers 
<A NAME="923"></A>was the contest an equal one to the Romans; at the same time, being exhausted 
<A NAME="924"></A>by running and the long continuation of the fight, they could not easily 
<A NAME="925"></A>withstand fresh and vigorous troops.
<A NAME="926"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 49</B>
<A NAME="927"></A><BR><BR>Caesar, when he perceived that his soldiers were fighting on unfavorable 
<A NAME="928"></A>ground, and that the enemy's forces were increasing, being alarmed for 
<A NAME="929"></A>the safety of his troops, sent orders to Titus Sextius, one of his lieutenants, 
<A NAME="930"></A>whom he had left to guard the smaller camp, to lead out his cohorts quickly 
<A NAME="931"></A>from the camp, and post them at the foot of the hill, on the right wing 
<A NAME="932"></A>of the enemy; that if he should see our men driven from the ground, he 
<A NAME="933"></A>should deter the enemy from following too closely. He himself, advancing 
<A NAME="934"></A>with the legion a little from that place where he had taken his post, awaited 
<A NAME="935"></A>the issue of the battle.
<A NAME="936"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 50</B>
<A NAME="937"></A><BR><BR>While the fight was going on most vigorously, hand to hand, and 
<A NAME="938"></A>the enemy depended on their position and numbers, our men on their bravery, 
<A NAME="939"></A>the Aedui suddenly appeared on our exposed flank, as Caesar had sent them 
<A NAME="940"></A>by another ascent on the right, for the sake of creating a diversion. These, 
<A NAME="941"></A>from the similarity of their arms, greatly terrified our men; and although 
<A NAME="942"></A>they were discovered to have their right shoulders bare, which was usually 
<A NAME="943"></A>the sign of those reduced to peace, yet the soldiers suspected that this 
<A NAME="944"></A>very thing was done by the enemy to deceive them. At the same time Lucius 
<A NAME="945"></A>Fabius the centurion, and those who had scaled the wall with him, being 
<A NAME="946"></A>surrounded and slain, were cast from the wall. Marcus Petreius, a centurion 
<A NAME="947"></A>of the same legion, after attempting to hew down the gates, was overpowered 
<A NAME="948"></A>by numbers, and, despairing of his safety, having already received many 
<A NAME="949"></A>wounds, said to the soldiers of his own company who followed him: "Since 
<A NAME="950"></A>I can not save you as well as myself, I shall at least provide for your 
<A NAME="951"></A>safety, since I, allured by the love of glory, led you into this danger, 
<A NAME="952"></A>do you save yourselves when an opportunity is given." At the same time 
<A NAME="953"></A>he rushed into the midst of the enemy, and slaying two of them, drove back 
<A NAME="954"></A>the rest a little from the gate. When his men attempted to aid him, "In 
<A NAME="955"></A>vain," he says, "you endeavor to procure me safety, since blood and strength 
<A NAME="956"></A>are now failing me, therefore leave this, while you have the opportunity, 
<A NAME="957"></A>and retreat to the legion." Thus he fell fighting a few moments after, 
<A NAME="958"></A>and saved his men by his own death.
<A NAME="959"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 51</B>
<A NAME="960"></A><BR><BR>Our soldiers, being hard pressed on every side, were dislodged 
<A NAME="961"></A>from their position, with the loss of forty-six centurions; but the tenth 
<A NAME="962"></A>legion, which had been posted in reserve on ground a little more level, 
<A NAME="963"></A>checked the Gauls in their eager pursuit. It was supported by the cohorts 
<A NAME="964"></A>of the thirteenth legion, which, being led from the smaller camp, had, 
<A NAME="965"></A>under the command of Titus Sextius, occupied the higher ground. The legions, 
<A NAME="966"></A>as soon as they reached the plain, halted and faced the enemy. Vercingetorix 
<A NAME="967"></A>led back his men from the part of the hill within the fortifications. On 
<A NAME="968"></A>that day little less than seven hundred of the soldiers were 
<A NAME="969"></A>missing.
<A NAME="970"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 52</B>
<A NAME="971"></A><BR><BR>On the next day, Caesar, having called a meeting, censured the 
<A NAME="972"></A>rashness and avarice of his soldiers, "In that they had judged for themselves 
<A NAME="973"></A>how far they ought to proceed, or what they ought to do, and could not 
<A NAME="974"></A>be kept back by the tribunes of the soldiers and the lieutenants;" and 
<A NAME="975"></A>stated, "what the disadvantage of the ground could effect, what opinion 
<A NAME="976"></A>he himself had entertained at Avaricum, when having surprised the enemy 
<A NAME="977"></A>without either general or cavalry, he had given up a certain victory, lest 
<A NAME="978"></A>even a trifling loss should occur in the contest owing to the disadvantage 
<A NAME="979"></A>of position. That as much as he admired the greatness of their courage, 
<A NAME="980"></A>since neither the fortifications of the camp, nor the height of the mountain, 
<A NAME="981"></A>nor the wall of the town could retard them; in the same degree he censured 
<A NAME="982"></A>their licentiousness and arrogance, because they thought that they knew 
<A NAME="983"></A>more than their general concerning victory, and the issue of actions: and 
<A NAME="984"></A>that he required in his soldiers forbearance and self-command, not less 
<A NAME="985"></A>than valor and magnanimity."
<A NAME="986"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 53</B>
<A NAME="987"></A><BR><BR>Having held this assembly, and having encouraged the soldiers at 
<A NAME="988"></A>the conclusion of his speech, "That they should not be dispirited on this 
<A NAME="989"></A>account, nor attribute to the valor of the enemy, what the disadvantage 
<A NAME="990"></A>of position had caused;" entertaining the same views of his departure that 
<A NAME="991"></A>he had previously had, he led forth the legions from the camp, and drew 
<A NAME="992"></A>up his army in order of battle in a suitable place. When Vercingetorix, 
<A NAME="993"></A>nevertheless, would not descend to the level ground, a slight cavalry action, 
<A NAME="994"></A>and that a successful one, having taken place, he led back his army into 
<A NAME="995"></A>the camp. When he had done this, the next day, thinking that he had done 
<A NAME="996"></A>enough to lower the pride of the Gauls, and to encourage the minds of his 
<A NAME="997"></A>soldiers, he moved his camp in the direction of the Aedui. The enemy not 
<A NAME="998"></A>even then pursuing us, on the third day he repaired the bridge over the 
<A NAME="999"></A>river Allier, and led over his whole army.
<A NAME="1000"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 54</B>
<A NAME="1001"></A><BR><BR>Having then held an interview with Viridomarus and Eporedirix the 
<A NAME="1002"></A>Aeduans, he learns that Litavicus had set out with all the cavalry to raise 
<A NAME="1003"></A>the Aedui; that it was necessary that they too should go before him to 
<A NAME="1004"></A>confirm the state in their allegiance. Although he now saw distinctly the 
<A NAME="1005"></A>treachery of the Aedui in many things, and was of opinion that the revolt 
<A NAME="1006"></A>of the entire state would be hastened by their departure; yet he thought 
<A NAME="1007"></A>that they should not be detained, lest he should appear either to offer 
<A NAME="1008"></A>an insult, or betray some suspicion of fear. He briefly states to them 
<A NAME="1009"></A>when departing his services toward the Aedui: in what a state and how humbled 
<A NAME="1010"></A>he had found them, driven into their towns, deprived of their lands, stripped 
<A NAME="1011"></A>of all their forces, a tribute imposed on them, and hostages wrested from 
<A NAME="1012"></A>them with the utmost insult; and to what condition and to what greatness 
<A NAME="1013"></A>he had raised them, [so much so] that they had not only recovered their 
<A NAME="1014"></A>former position, but seemed to surpass the dignity and influence of all 
<A NAME="1015"></A>the previous eras of their history. After giving these admonitions he dismissed 
<A NAME="1016"></A>them.
<A NAME="1017"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 55</B>
<A NAME="1018"></A><BR><BR>Noviodunum was a town of the Aedui, advantageously situated on 
<A NAME="1019"></A>the banks of the Loire. Caesar had conveyed hither all the hostages of 
<A NAME="1020"></A>Gaul, the corn, public money, a great part of his own baggage and that 
<A NAME="1021"></A>of his army; he had sent hither a great number of horses, which he had 
<A NAME="1022"></A>purchased in Italy and Spain on account of this war. When Eporedirix and 
<A NAME="1023"></A>Viridomarus came to this place, and received information of the disposition 
<A NAME="1024"></A>of the state, that Litavicus had been admitted by the Aedui into Bibracte, 
<A NAME="1025"></A>which is a town of the greatest importance among them, that Convictolitanis 
<A NAME="1026"></A>the chief magistrate and a great part of the senate had gone to meet him, 
<A NAME="1027"></A>that embassadors had been publicly sent to Vercingetorix to negotiate a 
<A NAME="1028"></A>peace and alliance; they thought that so great an opportunity ought not 
<A NAME="1029"></A>to be neglected. Therefore, having put to the sword the garrison of Noviodunum, 
<A NAME="1030"></A>and those who had assembled there for the purpose of trading or were on 
<A NAME="1031"></A>their march, they divided the money and horses among themselves; they took 
<A NAME="1032"></A>care that the hostages of the [different] states should be brought to Bibracte, 
<A NAME="1033"></A>to the chief magistrate; they burned the town to prevent its being of any 
<A NAME="1034"></A>service to the Romans, as they were of opinion that they could not hold 
<A NAME="1035"></A>it; they carried away in their vessels whatever corn they could in the 
<A NAME="1036"></A>hurry, they destroyed the remainder, by [throwing it] into the river or 
<A NAME="1037"></A>setting it on fire, they themselves began to collect forces from the neighboring 
<A NAME="1038"></A>country, to place guards and garrisons in different positions along the 
<A NAME="1039"></A>banks of the Loire, and to display the cavalry on all sides to strike terror 
<A NAME="1040"></A>into the Romans, [to try] if they could cut them off from a supply of provisions. 
<A NAME="1041"></A>In which expectation they were much aided, from the circumstance that the 
<A NAME="1042"></A>Loire had swollen to such a degree from the melting of the snows, that 
<A NAME="1043"></A>it did not seem capable of being forded at all.
<A NAME="1044"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 56</B>
<A NAME="1045"></A><BR><BR>Caesar on being informed of these movements was of opinion that 
<A NAME="1046"></A>he ought to make haste, even if he should run some risk in completing the 
<A NAME="1047"></A>bridges, in order that he might engage before greater forces of the enemy 
<A NAME="1048"></A>should be collected in that place. For no one even then considered it an 
<A NAME="1049"></A>absolutely necessary act, that changing his design he should direct his 
<A NAME="1050"></A>march into the Province, both because the infamy and disgrace of the thing, 
<A NAME="1051"></A>and the intervening mount Cevennes, and the difficulty of the roads prevented 
<A NAME="1052"></A>him; and especially because he had serious apprehensions for the safety 
<A NAME="1053"></A>of Labienus whom he had detached, and those legions whom he had sent with 
<A NAME="1054"></A>him. Therefore, having made very long marches by day and night, he came 
<A NAME="1055"></A>to the river Loire, contrary to the expectation of all; and having by means 
<A NAME="1056"></A>of the cavalry, found out a ford, suitable enough considering the emergency, 
<A NAME="1057"></A>of such depth that their arms and shoulders could be above water for supporting 
<A NAME="1058"></A>their accoutrements, he dispersed his cavalry in such a manner as to break 
<A NAME="1059"></A>the force of the current, and having confounded the enemy at the first 
<A NAME="1060"></A>sight, led his army across the river in safety; and finding corn and cattle 
<A NAME="1061"></A>in the fields, after refreshing his army with them, he determined to march 
<A NAME="1062"></A>into the country of the Senones.
<A NAME="1063"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 57</B>
<A NAME="1064"></A><BR><BR>While these things are being done by Caesar, Labienus, leaving 
<A NAME="1065"></A>at Agendicum the recruits who had lately arrived from Italy, to guard the 
<A NAME="1066"></A>baggage, marches with four legions to Lutetia (which is a town of the Parisii, 
<A NAME="1067"></A>situated on an island on the river Seine), whose arrival being discovered 
<A NAME="1068"></A>by the enemy, numerous forces arrived from the neighboring states. The 
<A NAME="1069"></A>supreme command is intrusted to Camalugenus one of the Aulerci, who, although 
<A NAME="1070"></A>almost worn out with age, was called to that honor on account of his extraordinary 
<A NAME="1071"></A>knowledge of military tactics. He, when he observed that there was a large 
<A NAME="1072"></A>marsh which communicated with the Seine, and rendered all that country 
<A NAME="1073"></A>impassable, encamped there, and determined to prevent our troops from passing 
<A NAME="1074"></A>it.
<A NAME="1075"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 58</B>
<A NAME="1076"></A><BR><BR>Labienus at first attempted to raise Vineae, fill up the marsh 
<A NAME="1077"></A>with hurdles and clay, and secure a road. After he perceived that this 
<A NAME="1078"></A>was too difficult to accomplish, he issued in silence from his camp at 
<A NAME="1079"></A>the third watch, and reached Melodunum by the same route by which he came. 
<A NAME="1080"></A>This is a town of the Senones, situated on an island in the Seine, as we 
<A NAME="1081"></A>have just before observed of Lutetia. Having seized upon about fifty ships 
<A NAME="1082"></A>and quickly joined them together, and having placed soldiers in them, he 
<A NAME="1083"></A>intimidated by his unexpected arrival the inhabitants, of whom a great 
<A NAME="1084"></A>number had been called out to the war, and obtains possession of the town 
<A NAME="1085"></A>without a contest. Having repaired the bridge, which the enemy had broken 
<A NAME="1086"></A>down during the preceding days, he led over his army, and began to march 
<A NAME="1087"></A>along the banks of the river to Lutetia. The enemy, on learning the circumstance 
<A NAME="1088"></A>from those who had escaped from Melodunum, set fire to Lutetia, and order 
<A NAME="1089"></A>the bridges of that town to be broken down: they themselves set out from 
<A NAME="1090"></A>the marsh, and take their position on the banks of the Seine, over against 
<A NAME="1091"></A>Lutetia and opposite the camp of Labienus.
<A NAME="1092"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 59</B>
<A NAME="1093"></A><BR><BR>Caesar was now reported to have departed from Gergovia; intelligence 
<A NAME="1094"></A>was likewise brought to them concerning the revolt of the Aedui, and a 
<A NAME="1095"></A>successful rising in Gaul; and that Caesar, having been prevented from 
<A NAME="1096"></A>prosecuting his journey and crossing the Loire, and having been compelled 
<A NAME="1097"></A>by the want of corn, had marched hastily to the province. But the Bellovaci, 
<A NAME="1098"></A>who had been previously disaffected of themselves, on learning the revolt 
<A NAME="1099"></A>of the Aedui, began to assemble forces and openly to prepare for war. Then 
<A NAME="1100"></A>Labienus, as the change in affairs was so great, thought that he must adopt 
<A NAME="1101"></A>a very different system from what he had previously intended, and he did 
<A NAME="1102"></A>not now think of making any new acquisitions, or of provoking the enemy 
<A NAME="1103"></A>to an action; but that he might bring back his army safe to Agendicum. 
<A NAME="1104"></A>For, on one side, the Bellovaci, a state which held the highest reputation 
<A NAME="1105"></A>for prowess in Gaul, were pressing on him; and Camulogenus, with a disciplined 
<A NAME="1106"></A>and well-equipped army, held the other side; moreover, a very great river
