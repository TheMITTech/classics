<A NAME="start"></A>
<A NAME="10"></A><B>Chapter 1</B>
<A NAME="11"></A><BR><BR>All Gaul is divided into three parts, one of which the Belgae inhabit, 
<A NAME="12"></A>the Aquitani another, those who in their own language are called Celts, 
<A NAME="13"></A>in our Gauls, the third. All these differ from each other in language, 
<A NAME="14"></A>customs and laws. The river Garonne separates the Gauls from the Aquitani; 
<A NAME="15"></A>the Marne and the Seine separate them from the Belgae. Of all these, the 
<A NAME="16"></A>Belgae are the bravest, because they are furthest from the civilization 
<A NAME="17"></A>and refinement of [our] Province, and merchants least frequently resort 
<A NAME="18"></A>to them, and import those things which tend to effeminate the mind; and 
<A NAME="19"></A>they are the nearest to the Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom 
<A NAME="20"></A>they are continually waging war; for which reason the Helvetii also surpass 
<A NAME="21"></A>the rest of the Gauls in valor, as they contend with the Germans in almost 
<A NAME="22"></A>daily battles, when they either repel them from their own territories, 
<A NAME="23"></A>or themselves wage war on their frontiers. One part of these, which it 
<A NAME="24"></A>has been said that the Gauls occupy, takes its beginning at the river Rhone; 
<A NAME="25"></A>it is bounded by the river Garonne, the ocean, and the territories of the 
<A NAME="26"></A>Belgae; it borders, too, on the side of the Sequani and the Helvetii, upon 
<A NAME="27"></A>the river Rhine, and stretches toward the north. The Belgae rises from 
<A NAME="28"></A>the extreme frontier of Gaul, extend to the lower part of the river Rhine; 
<A NAME="29"></A>and look toward the north and the rising sun. Aquitania extends from the 
<A NAME="30"></A>river Garonne to the Pyrenaean mountains and to that part of the ocean 
<A NAME="31"></A>which is near Spain: it looks between the setting of the sun, and the north 
<A NAME="32"></A>star.
<A NAME="33"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 2</B>
<A NAME="34"></A><BR><BR>Among the Helvetii, Orgetorix was by far the most distinguished 
<A NAME="35"></A>and wealthy. He, when Marcus Messala and Marcus Piso were consuls, incited 
<A NAME="36"></A>by lust of sovereignty, formed a conspiracy among the nobility, and persuaded 
<A NAME="37"></A>the people to go forth from their territories with all their possessions, 
<A NAME="38"></A>[saying] that it would be very easy, since they excelled all in valor, 
<A NAME="39"></A>to acquire the supremacy of the whole of Gaul. To this he the more easily 
<A NAME="40"></A>persuaded them, because the Helvetii, are confined on every side by the 
<A NAME="41"></A>nature of their situation; on one side by the Rhine, a very broad and deep 
<A NAME="42"></A>river, which separates the Helvetian territory from the Germans; on a second 
<A NAME="43"></A>side by the Jura, a very high mountain, which is [situated] between the 
<A NAME="44"></A>Sequani and the Helvetii; on a third by the Lake of Geneva, and by the 
<A NAME="45"></A>river Rhone, which separates our Province from the Helvetii. From these 
<A NAME="46"></A>circumstances it resulted, that they could range less widely, and could 
<A NAME="47"></A>less easily make war upon their neighbors; for which reason men fond of 
<A NAME="48"></A>war [as they were] were affected with great regret. They thought, that 
<A NAME="49"></A>considering the extent of their population, and their renown for warfare 
<A NAME="50"></A>and bravery, they had but narrow limits, although they extended in length 
<A NAME="51"></A>240, and in breadth 180 [Roman] miles.
<A NAME="52"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 3</B>
<A NAME="53"></A><BR><BR>Induced by these considerations, and influenced by the authority 
<A NAME="54"></A>of Orgetorix, they determined to provide such things as were necessary 
<A NAME="55"></A>for their expedition - to buy up as great a number as possible of beasts 
<A NAME="56"></A>of burden and wagons - to make their sowings as large as possible, so that 
<A NAME="57"></A>on their march plenty of corn might be in store - and to establish peace 
<A NAME="58"></A>and friendship with the neighboring states. They reckoned that a term of 
<A NAME="59"></A>two years would be sufficient for them to execute their designs; they fix 
<A NAME="60"></A>by decree their departure for the third year. Orgetorix is chosen to complete 
<A NAME="61"></A>these arrangements. He took upon himself the office of embassador to the 
<A NAME="62"></A>states: on this journey he persuades Casticus, the son of Catamantaledes 
<A NAME="63"></A>(one of the Sequani, whose father had possessed the sovereignty among the 
<A NAME="64"></A>people for many years, and had been styled "friend" by the senate of the 
<A NAME="65"></A>Roman people), to seize upon the sovereignty in his own state, which his 
<A NAME="66"></A>father had held before him, and he likewise persuades Dumnorix, an Aeduan, 
<A NAME="67"></A>the brother of Divitiacus, who at that time possessed the chief authority 
<A NAME="68"></A>in the state, and was exceedingly beloved by the people, to attempt the 
<A NAME="69"></A>same, and gives him his daughter in marriage. He proves to them that to 
<A NAME="70"></A>accomplish their attempts was a thing very easy to be done, because he 
<A NAME="71"></A>himself would obtain the government of his own state; that there was no 
<A NAME="72"></A>doubt that the Helvetii were the most powerful of the whole of Gaul; he 
<A NAME="73"></A>assures them that he will, with his own forces and his own army, acquire 
<A NAME="74"></A>the sovereignty for them. Incited by this speech, they give a pledge and 
<A NAME="75"></A>oath to one another, and hope that, when they have seized the sovereignty, 
<A NAME="76"></A>they will, by means of the three most powerful and valiant nations, be 
<A NAME="77"></A>enabled to obtain possession of the whole of Gaul.
<A NAME="78"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 4</B>
<A NAME="79"></A><BR><BR>When this scheme was disclosed to the Helvetii by informers, they, 
<A NAME="80"></A>according to their custom, compelled Orgetorix to plead his cause in chains; 
<A NAME="81"></A>it was the law that the penalty of being burned by fire should await him 
<A NAME="82"></A>if condemned. On the day appointed for the pleading of his cause, Orgetorix 
<A NAME="83"></A>drew together from all quarters to the court, all his vassals to the number 
<A NAME="84"></A>of ten thousand persons; and led together to the same place all his dependents 
<A NAME="85"></A>and debtor-bondsmen, of whom he had a great number; by means of those he 
<A NAME="86"></A>rescued himself from [the necessity of] pleading his cause. While the state, 
<A NAME="87"></A>incensed at this act, was endeavoring to assert its right by arms, and 
<A NAME="88"></A>the magistrates were mustering a large body of men from the country, Orgetorix 
<A NAME="89"></A>died; and there is not wanting a suspicion, as the Helvetii think, of his 
<A NAME="90"></A>having committed suicide.
<A NAME="91"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 5</B>
<A NAME="92"></A><BR><BR>After his death, the Helvetii nevertheless attempt to do that which 
<A NAME="93"></A>they had resolved on, namely, to go forth from their territories. When 
<A NAME="94"></A>they thought that they were at length prepared for this undertaking, they 
<A NAME="95"></A>set fire to all their towns, in number about twelve - to their villages 
<A NAME="96"></A>about four hundred - and to the private dwellings that remained; they burn 
<A NAME="97"></A>up all the corn, except what they intend to carry with them; that after 
<A NAME="98"></A>destroying the hope of a return home, they might be the more ready for 
<A NAME="99"></A>undergoing all dangers. They order every one to carry forth from home for 
<A NAME="100"></A>himself provisions for three months, ready ground. They persuade the Rauraci, 
<A NAME="101"></A>and the Tulingi, and the Latobrigi, their neighbors, to adopt the same 
<A NAME="102"></A>plan, and after burning down their towns and villages, to set out with 
<A NAME="103"></A>them: and they admit to their party and unite to themselves as confederates 
<A NAME="104"></A>the Boii, who had dwelt on the other side of the Rhine, and had crossed 
<A NAME="105"></A>over into the Norican territory, and assaulted Noreia.
<A NAME="106"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 6</B>
<A NAME="107"></A><BR><BR>There were in all two routes, by which they could go forth from 
<A NAME="108"></A>their country one through the Sequani narrow and difficult, between Mount 
<A NAME="109"></A>Jura and the river Rhone (by which scarcely one wagon at a time could be 
<A NAME="110"></A>led; there was, moreover, a very high mountain overhanging, so that a very 
<A NAME="111"></A>few might easily intercept them; the other, through our Province, much 
<A NAME="112"></A>easier and freer from obstacles, because the Rhone flows between the boundaries 
<A NAME="113"></A>of the Helvetii and those of the Allobroges, who had lately been subdued, 
<A NAME="114"></A>and is in some places crossed by a ford. The furthest town of the Allobroges, 
<A NAME="115"></A>and the nearest to the territories of the Helvetii, is Geneva. From this 
<A NAME="116"></A>town a bridge extends to the Helvetii. They thought that they should either 
<A NAME="117"></A>persuade the Allobroges, because they did not seem as yet well-affected 
<A NAME="118"></A>toward the Roman people, or compel them by force to allow them to pass 
<A NAME="119"></A>through their territories. Having provided every thing for the expedition, 
<A NAME="120"></A>they appoint a day, on which they should all meet on the bank of the Rhone. 
<A NAME="121"></A>This day was the fifth before the kalends of April [i.e. the 28th of March], 
<A NAME="122"></A>in the consulship of Lucius Piso and Aulus Gabinius [B.C. 
<A NAME="123"></A>58.]
<A NAME="124"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 7</B>
<A NAME="125"></A><BR><BR>When it was reported to Caesar that they were attempting to make 
<A NAME="126"></A>their route through our Province he hastens to set out from the city, and, 
<A NAME="127"></A>by as great marches as he can, proceeds to Further Gaul, and arrives at 
<A NAME="128"></A>Geneva. He orders the whole Province [to furnish] as great a number of 
<A NAME="129"></A>soldiers as possible, as there was in all only one legion in Further Gaul: 
<A NAME="130"></A>he orders the bridge at Geneva to be broken down. When the Helvetii are 
<A NAME="131"></A>apprized of his arrival they send to him, as embassadors, the most illustrious 
<A NAME="132"></A>men of their state (in which embassy Numeius and Verudoctius held the chief 
<A NAME="133"></A>place), to say "that it was their intention to march through the Province 
<A NAME="134"></A>without doing any harm, because they had" [according to their own representations,] 
<A NAME="135"></A>"no other route: that they requested, they might be allowed to do so with 
<A NAME="136"></A>his consent." Caesar, inasmuch as he kept in remembrance that Lucius Cassius, 
<A NAME="137"></A>the consul, had been slain, and his army routed and made to pass under 
<A NAME="138"></A>the yoke by the Helvetii, did not think that [their request] ought to be 
<A NAME="139"></A>granted: nor was he of opinion that men of hostile disposition, if an opportunity 
<A NAME="140"></A>of marching through the Province were given them, would abstain from outrage 
<A NAME="141"></A>and mischief. Yet, in order that a period might intervene, until the soldiers 
<A NAME="142"></A>whom he had ordered [to be furnished] should assemble, he replied to the 
<A NAME="143"></A>ambassadors, that he would take time to deliberate; if they wanted any 
<A NAME="144"></A>thing, they might return on the day before the ides of April [on April 
<A NAME="145"></A>12th].
<A NAME="146"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 8</B>
<A NAME="147"></A><BR><BR>Meanwhile, with the legion which he had with him and the soldiers 
<A NAME="148"></A>which had assembled from the Province, he carries along for nineteen [Roman, 
<A NAME="149"></A>not quite eighteen English] miles a wall, to the height of sixteen feet, 
<A NAME="150"></A>and a trench, from the Lake of Geneva, which flows into the river Rhone, 
<A NAME="151"></A>to Mount Jura, which separates the territories of the Sequani from those 
<A NAME="152"></A>of the Helvetii. When that work was finished, he distributes garrisons, 
<A NAME="153"></A>and closely fortifies redoubts, in order that he may the more easily intercept 
<A NAME="154"></A>them, if they should attempt to cross over against his will. When the day 
<A NAME="155"></A>which he had appointed with the embassadors came, and they returned to 
<A NAME="156"></A>him; he says, that he can not, consistently with the custom and precedent 
<A NAME="157"></A>of the Roman people, grant any one a passage through the Province; and 
<A NAME="158"></A>he gives them to understand, that, if they should attempt to use violence 
<A NAME="159"></A>he would oppose them. The Helvetii, disappointed in this hope, tried if 
<A NAME="160"></A>they could force a passage (some by means of a bridge of boats and numerous 
<A NAME="161"></A>rafts constructed for the purpose; others, by the fords of the Rhone, where 
<A NAME="162"></A>the depth of the river was least, sometimes by day, but more frequently 
<A NAME="163"></A>by night), but being kept at bay by the strength of our works, and by the 
<A NAME="164"></A>concourse of the soldiers, and by the missiles, they desisted from this 
<A NAME="165"></A>attempt.
<A NAME="166"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 9</B>
<A NAME="167"></A><BR><BR>There was left one way, [namely] through the Sequani, by which, 
<A NAME="168"></A>on account of its narrowness, they could not pass without the consent of 
<A NAME="169"></A>the Sequani. As they could not of themselves prevail on them, they send 
<A NAME="170"></A>embassadors to Dumnorix the Aeduan, that through his intercession, they 
<A NAME="171"></A>might obtain their request from the Sequani. Dumnorix, by his popularity 
<A NAME="172"></A>and liberality, had great influence among the Sequani, and was friendly 
<A NAME="173"></A>to the Helvetii, because out of that state he had married the daughter 
<A NAME="174"></A>of Orgetorix; and, incited by lust of sovereignty, was anxious for a revolution, 
<A NAME="175"></A>and wished to have as many states as possible attached to him by his kindness 
<A NAME="176"></A>toward them. He, therefore, undertakes the affair, and prevails upon the 
<A NAME="177"></A>Sequani to allow the Helvetii to march through their territories, and arranges 
<A NAME="178"></A>that they should give hostages to each other - the Sequani not to obstruct 
<A NAME="179"></A>the Helvetii in their march - the Helvetii, to pass without mischief and 
<A NAME="180"></A>outrage.
<A NAME="181"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 10</B>
<A NAME="182"></A><BR><BR>It is again told Caesar, that the Helvetii intended to march through 
<A NAME="183"></A>the country of the Sequani and the Aedui into the territories of the Santones, 
<A NAME="184"></A>which are not far distant from those boundaries of the Tolosates, which 
<A NAME="185"></A>[viz. Tolosa, Toulouse] is a state in the Province. If this took place, 
<A NAME="186"></A>he saw that it would be attended with great danger to the Province to have 
<A NAME="187"></A>warlike men, enemies of the Roman people, bordering upon an open and very 
<A NAME="188"></A>fertile tract of country. For these reasons he appointed Titus Labienus, 
<A NAME="189"></A>his lieutenant, to the command of the fortification which he had made. 
<A NAME="190"></A>He himself proceeds to Italy by forced marches, and there levies two legions, 
<A NAME="191"></A>and leads out from winter-quarters three which were wintering around Aquileia, 
<A NAME="192"></A>and with these five legions marches rapidly by the nearest route across 
<A NAME="193"></A>the Alps into Further Gaul. Here the Centrones and the Graioceli and the 
<A NAME="194"></A>Caturiges, having taken possession of the higher parts, attempt to obstruct 
<A NAME="195"></A>the army in their march. After having routed these in several battles, 
<A NAME="196"></A>he arrives in the territories of the Vocontii in the Further Province on 
<A NAME="197"></A>the seventh day from Ocelum, which is the most remote town of the Hither 
<A NAME="198"></A>Province; thence he leads his army into the country of the Allobroges, 
<A NAME="199"></A>and from the Allobroges to the Segusiani. These people are the first beyond 
<A NAME="200"></A>the Province on the opposite side of the Rhone.
<A NAME="201"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 11</B>
<A NAME="202"></A><BR><BR>The Helvetii had by this time led their forces over through the 
<A NAME="203"></A>narrow defile and the territories of the Sequani, and had arrived at the 
<A NAME="204"></A>territories of the Aedui, and were ravaging their lands. The Aedui, as 
<A NAME="205"></A>they could not defend themselves and their possessions against them, send 
<A NAME="206"></A>embassadors to Caesar to ask assistance, [pleading] that they had at all 
<A NAME="207"></A>times so well deserved of the Roman people, that their fields ought not 
<A NAME="208"></A>to have been laid waste - their children carried off into slavery - their 
<A NAME="209"></A>towns stormed, almost within sight of our army. At the same time the Ambarri, 
<A NAME="210"></A>the friends and kinsmen of the Aedui, apprize Caesar, that it was not easy 
<A NAME="211"></A>for them, now that their fields had been devastated, to ward off the violence 
<A NAME="212"></A>of the enemy from their towns: the Allobroges likewise, who had villages 
<A NAME="213"></A>and possessions on the other side of the Rhone, betake themselves in flight 
<A NAME="214"></A>to Caesar, and assure him that they had nothing remaining, except the soil 
<A NAME="215"></A>of their land. Caesar, induced by these circumstances, decides, that he 
<A NAME="216"></A>ought not to wait until the Helvetii, after destroying all the property 
<A NAME="217"></A>of his allies, should arrive among the Santones.
<A NAME="218"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 12</B>
<A NAME="219"></A><BR><BR>There is a river [called] the Saone, which flows through the territories 
<A NAME="220"></A>of the Aedui and Sequani into the Rhone with such incredible slowness, 
<A NAME="221"></A>that it can not be determined by the eye in which direction it flows. This 
<A NAME="222"></A>the Helvetii were crossing by rafts and boats joined together. When Caesar 
<A NAME="223"></A>was informed by spies that the Helvetii had already conveyed three parts 
<A NAME="224"></A>of their forces across that river, but that the fourth part was left behind 
<A NAME="225"></A>on this side of the Saone, he set out from the camp with three legions 
<A NAME="226"></A>during the third watch, and came up with that division which had not yet 
<A NAME="227"></A>crossed the river. Attacking them encumbered with baggage, and not expecting 
<A NAME="228"></A>him, he cut to pieces a great part of them; the rest betook themselves 
<A NAME="229"></A>to flight, and concealed themselves in the nearest woods. That canton [which 
<A NAME="230"></A>was cut down] was called the Tigurine; for the whole Helvetian state is 
<A NAME="231"></A>divided into four cantons. This single canton having left their country, 
<A NAME="232"></A>within the recollection of our fathers, had slain Lucius Cassius the consul, 
<A NAME="233"></A>and had made his army pass under the yoke. Thus, whether by chance, or 
<A NAME="234"></A>by the design of the immortal gods, that part of the Helvetian state which 
<A NAME="235"></A>had brought a signal calamity upon the Roman people, was the first to pay 
<A NAME="236"></A>the penalty. In this Caesar avenged not only the public but also his own 
<A NAME="237"></A>personal wrongs, because the Tigurini had slain Lucius Piso the lieutenant 
<A NAME="238"></A>[of Cassius], the grandfather of Lucius Calpurnius Piso, his [Caesar's] 
<A NAME="239"></A>father-in-law, in the same battle as Cassius himself.
<A NAME="240"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 13</B>
<A NAME="241"></A><BR><BR>This battle ended, that he might be able to come up with the remaining 
<A NAME="242"></A>forces of the Helvetii, he procures a bridge to be made across the Saone, 
<A NAME="243"></A>and thus leads his army over. The Helvetii, confused by his sudden arrival, 
<A NAME="244"></A>when they found that he had effected in one day, what they, themselves 
<A NAME="245"></A>had with the utmost difficulty accomplished in twenty namely, the crossing 
<A NAME="246"></A>of the river, send embassadors to him; at the head of which embassy was 
<A NAME="247"></A>Divico, who had been commander of the Helvetii, in the war against Cassius. 
<A NAME="248"></A>He thus treats with Caesar: - that, "if the Roman people would make peace 
<A NAME="249"></A>with the Helvetii they would go to that part and there remain, where Caesar 
<A NAME="250"></A>might appoint and desire them to be; but if he should persist in persecuting 
<A NAME="251"></A>them with war that he ought to remember both the ancient disgrace of the 
<A NAME="252"></A>Roman people and the characteristic valor of the Helvetii. As to his having 
<A NAME="253"></A>attacked one canton by surprise, [at a time] when those who had crossed 
<A NAME="254"></A>the river could not bring assistance to their friends, that he ought not 
<A NAME="255"></A>on that account to ascribe very much to his own valor, or despise them; 
<A NAME="256"></A>that they had so learned from their sires and ancestors, as to rely more 
<A NAME="257"></A>on valor than on artifice and stratagem. Wherefore let him not bring it 
<A NAME="258"></A>to pass that the place, where they were standing, should acquire a name, 
<A NAME="259"></A>from the disaster of the Roman people and the destruction of their army 
<A NAME="260"></A>or transmit the remembrance [of such an event to posterity]."
<A NAME="261"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 14</B>
<A NAME="262"></A><BR><BR>To these words Caesar thus replied: - that "on that very account 
<A NAME="263"></A>he felt less hesitation, because he kept in remembrance those circumstances 
<A NAME="264"></A>which the Helvetian embassadors had mentioned, and that he felt the more 
<A NAME="265"></A>indignant at them, in proportion as they had happened undeservedly to the 
<A NAME="266"></A>Roman people: for if they had been conscious of having done any wrong, 
<A NAME="267"></A>it would not have been difficult to be on their guard, but for that very 
<A NAME="268"></A>reason had they been deceived, because neither were they aware that any 
<A NAME="269"></A>offense had been given by them, on account of which they should be afraid, 
<A NAME="270"></A>nor did they think that they ought to be afraid without cause. But even 
<A NAME="271"></A>if he were willing to forget their former outrage, could he also lay aside 
<A NAME="272"></A>the remembrance of the late wrongs, in that they had against his will attempted 
<A NAME="273"></A>a route through the Province by force, in that they had molested the Aedui, 
<A NAME="274"></A>the Ambarri, and the Allobroges? That as to their so insolently boasting 
<A NAME="275"></A>of their victory, and as to their being astonished that they had so long 
<A NAME="276"></A>committed their outrages with impunity, [both these things] tended to the 
<A NAME="277"></A>same point; for the immortal gods are wont to allow those persons whom 
<A NAME="278"></A>they wish to punish for their guilt sometimes a greater prosperity and 
<A NAME="279"></A>longer impunity, in order that they may suffer the more severely from a 
<A NAME="280"></A>reverse of circumstances. Although these things are so, yet, if hostages 
<A NAME="281"></A>were to be given him by them in order that he may be assured these will 
<A NAME="282"></A>do what they promise, and provided they will give satisfaction to the Aedui 
<A NAME="283"></A>for the outrages which they had committed against them and their allies, 
<A NAME="284"></A>and likewise to the Allobroges, he [Caesar] will make peace with them." 
<A NAME="285"></A>Divico replied, that "the Helvetii had been so trained by their ancestors, 
<A NAME="286"></A>that they were accustomed to receive, not to give hostages; of that fact 
<A NAME="287"></A>the Roman people were witness." Having given this reply, he 
<A NAME="288"></A>withdrew.
<A NAME="289"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 15</B>
<A NAME="290"></A><BR><BR>On the following day they move their camp from that place; Caesar 
<A NAME="291"></A>does the same, and sends forward all his cavalry, to the number of four 
<A NAME="292"></A>thousand (which he had drawn together from all parts of the Province and 
<A NAME="293"></A>from the Aedui and their allies), to observe toward what parts the enemy 
<A NAME="294"></A>are directing their march. These, having too eagerly pursued the enemy's 
<A NAME="295"></A>rear, come to a battle with the cavalry of the Helvetii in a disadvantageous 
<A NAME="296"></A>place, and a few of our men fall. The Helvetii, elated with this battle, 
<A NAME="297"></A>because they had with five hundred horse repulsed so large a body of horse, 
<A NAME="298"></A>began to face us more boldly, sometimes too from their rear to provoke 
<A NAME="299"></A>our men by an attack. Caesar [however] restrained his men from battle, 
<A NAME="300"></A>deeming it sufficient for the present to prevent the enemy from rapine, 
<A NAME="301"></A>forage, and depredation. They marched for about fifteen days in such a 
<A NAME="302"></A>manner that there was not more than five or six miles between the enemy's 
<A NAME="303"></A>rear and our van.
<A NAME="304"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 16</B>
<A NAME="305"></A><BR><BR>Meanwhile, Caesar kept daily importuning the Aedui for the corn 
<A NAME="306"></A>which they had promised in the name of their state; for, in consequence 
<A NAME="307"></A>of the coldness (Gaul, being as before said, situated toward the north), 
<A NAME="308"></A>not only was the corn in the fields not ripe, but there was not in store 
<A NAME="309"></A>a sufficiently large quantity even of fodder: besides he was unable to 
<A NAME="310"></A>use the corn which he had conveyed in ships up the river Saone, because 
<A NAME="311"></A>the Helvetii, from whom he was unwilling to retire had diverted their march 
<A NAME="312"></A>from the Saone. The Aedui kept deferring from day to day, and saying that 
<A NAME="313"></A>it was being collected - brought in - on the road." When he saw that he 
<A NAME="314"></A>was put off too long, and that the day was close at hand on which he ought 
<A NAME="315"></A>to serve out the corn to his soldiers; - having called together their chiefs, 
<A NAME="316"></A>of whom he had a great number in his camp, among them Divitiacus and Liscus 
<A NAME="317"></A>who was invested with the chief magistracy (whom the Aedui style the Vergobretus, 
<A NAME="318"></A>and who is elected annually and has power of life or death over his countrymen), 
<A NAME="319"></A>he severely reprimands them, because he is not assisted by them on so urgent 
<A NAME="320"></A>an occasion, when the enemy were so close at hand, and when [corn] could 
<A NAME="321"></A>neither be bought nor taken from the fields, particularly as, in a great 
<A NAME="322"></A>measure urged by their prayers, he had undertaken the war; much more bitterly, 
<A NAME="323"></A>therefore does he complain of his being forsaken.
<A NAME="324"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 17</B>
<A NAME="325"></A><BR><BR>Then at length Liscus, moved by Caesar's speech, discloses what 
<A NAME="326"></A>he had hitherto kept secret: - that there are some whose influences with 
<A NAME="327"></A>the people is very great, who, though private men, have more power than 
<A NAME="328"></A>the magistrates themselves: that these by seditions and violent language 
<A NAME="329"></A>are deterring the populace from contributing the corn which they ought 
<A NAME="330"></A>to supply; [by telling them] that, if they can not any longer retain the 
<A NAME="331"></A>supremacy of Gaul, it were better to submit to the government of Gauls 
<A NAME="332"></A>than of Romans, nor ought they to doubt that, if the Romans should overpower 
<A NAME="333"></A>the Helvetii, they would wrest their freedom from the Aedui together with 
<A NAME="334"></A>the remainder of Gaul. By these very men, [said he], are our plans and 
<A NAME="335"></A>whatever is done in the camp, disclosed to the enemy; that they could not 
<A NAME="336"></A>be restrained by him: nay more, he was well aware, that though compelled 
<A NAME="337"></A>by necessity, he had disclosed the matter to Caesar, at how great a risk 
<A NAME="338"></A>he had done it; and for that reason, he had been silent as long as he 
<A NAME="339"></A>could."
<A NAME="340"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 18</B>
<A NAME="341"></A><BR><BR>Caesar perceived that by this speech of Liscus, Dumnorix, the brother 
<A NAME="342"></A>of Divitiacus, was indicated; but, as he was unwilling that these matters 
<A NAME="343"></A>should be discussed while so many were present, he speedily dismisses: 
<A NAME="344"></A>the council, but detains Liscus: he inquires from him when alone, about 
<A NAME="345"></A>those things which he had said in the meeting. He [Liscus] speaks more 
<A NAME="346"></A>unreservedly and boldly. He [Caesar] makes inquiries on the same points 
<A NAME="347"></A>privately of others, and discovered that it is all true; that "Dumnorix 
<A NAME="348"></A>is the person, a man of the highest daring, in great favor with the people 
<A NAME="349"></A>on account of his liberality, a man eager for a revolution: that for a 
<A NAME="350"></A>great many years he has been in the habit of contracting for the customs 
<A NAME="351"></A>and all the other taxes of the Aedui at a small cost, because when he bids, 
<A NAME="352"></A>no one dares to bid against him. By these means he has both increased his 
<A NAME="353"></A>own private property, and amassed great means for giving largesses; that 
<A NAME="354"></A>he maintains constantly at his own expense and keeps about his own person 
<A NAME="355"></A>a great number of cavalry, and that not only at home, but even among the 
<A NAME="356"></A>neighboring states, he has great influence, and for the sake of strengthening 
<A NAME="357"></A>this influence has given his mother in marriage among the Bituriges to 
<A NAME="358"></A>a man the most noble and most influential there; that he has himself taken 
<A NAME="359"></A>a wife from among the Helvetii, and has given his sister by the mother's 
<A NAME="360"></A>side and his female relations in marriage into other states; that he favors 
<A NAME="361"></A>and wishes well to the Helvetii on account of this connection; and that 
<A NAME="362"></A>he hates Caesar and the Romans, on his own account, because by their arrival 
<A NAME="363"></A>his power was weakened, and his brother, Divitiacus, restored to his former 
<A NAME="364"></A>position of influence and dignity: that, if any thing should happen to 
<A NAME="365"></A>the Romans, he entertains the highest hope of gaining the sovereignty by 
<A NAME="366"></A>means of the Helvetii, but that under the government of the Roman people 
<A NAME="367"></A>he despairs not only of royalty, but even of that influence which he already 
<A NAME="368"></A>has." Caesar discovered too, on inquiring into the unsuccessful cavalry 
<A NAME="369"></A>engagement which had taken place a few days before, that the commencement 
<A NAME="370"></A>of that flight had been made by Dumnorix and his cavalry (for Dumnorix 
<A NAME="371"></A>was in command of the cavalry which the Aedui had sent for aid to Caesar); 
<A NAME="372"></A>that by their flight the rest of the cavalry were dismayed.
<A NAME="373"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 19</B>
<A NAME="374"></A><BR><BR>After learning these circumstances, since to these suspicions the 
<A NAME="375"></A>most unequivocal facts were added, viz., that he had led the Helvetii through 
<A NAME="376"></A>the territories of the Sequani; that he had provided that hostages should 
<A NAME="377"></A>be mutually given; that he had done all these things, not only without 
<A NAME="378"></A>any orders of his [Caesar's] and of his own state's, but even without their 
<A NAME="379"></A>[the Aedui] knowing any thing of it themselves; that he [Dumnorix] was 
<A NAME="380"></A>reprimanded: by the [chief] magistrate of the Aedui; he [Caesar] considered 
<A NAME="381"></A>that there was sufficient reason, why he should either punish him himself, 
<A NAME="382"></A>or order the state to do so. One thing [however] stood in the way of all 
<A NAME="383"></A>this - that he had learned by experience his brother Divitiacus's very 
<A NAME="384"></A>high regard for the Roman people, his great affection toward him, his distinguished 
<A NAME="385"></A>faithfulness, justice, and moderation; for he was afraid lest by the punishment 
<A NAME="386"></A>of this man, he should hurt the feelings of Divitiacus. Therefore, before 
<A NAME="387"></A>he attempted any thing, he orders Divitiacus to be summoned to him, and, 
<A NAME="388"></A>when the ordinary interpreters had been withdrawn, converses with him through 
<A NAME="389"></A>Caius Valerius Procillus, chief of the province of Gaul, an intimate friend 
<A NAME="390"></A>of his, in whom he reposed the highest confidence in every thing; at the 
<A NAME="391"></A>same time he reminds him of what was said about Dumnorix in the council 
<A NAME="392"></A>of the Gauls, when he himself was present, and shows what each had said 
<A NAME="393"></A>of him privately in his [Caesar's] own presence; he begs and exhorts him, 
<A NAME="394"></A>that, without offense to his feelings, he may either himself pass judgment 
<A NAME="395"></A>on him [Dumnorix] after trying the case, or else order the [Aeduan] state 
<A NAME="396"></A>to do so.
<A NAME="397"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 20</B>
<A NAME="398"></A><BR><BR>Divitiacus, embracing Caesar, begins to implore him, with many 
<A NAME="399"></A>tears, that "he would not pass any very severe sentence upon his brother; 
<A NAME="400"></A>saying, that he knows that those charges are true, and that nobody suffered 
<A NAME="401"></A>more pain on that account than he himself did; for when he himself could 
<A NAME="402"></A>effect a very great deal by his influence at home and in the rest of Gaul, 
<A NAME="403"></A>and he [Dumnorix] very little on account of his youth, the latter had become 
<A NAME="404"></A>powerful through his means, which power and strength he used not only to 
<A NAME="405"></A>the lessening of his [Divitiacus] popularity, but almost to his ruin; that 
<A NAME="406"></A>he, however, was influenced both by fraternal affection and by public opinion. 
<A NAME="407"></A>But if any thing very severe from Caesar should befall him [Dumnorix], 
<A NAME="408"></A>no one would think that it had been done without his consent, since he 
<A NAME="409"></A>himself held such a place in Caesar's friendship: from which circumstance 
<A NAME="410"></A>it would arise, that the affections of the whole of Gaul would be estranged 
<A NAME="411"></A>from him." As he was with tears begging these things of Caesar in many 
<A NAME="412"></A>words, Caesar takes his right hand, and, comforting him, begs him to make 
<A NAME="413"></A>an end of entreating, and assures him that his regard for him is so great, 
<A NAME="414"></A>that he forgives both the injuries of the republic and his private wrongs, 
<A NAME="415"></A>at his desire and prayers. He summons Dumnorix to him; he brings in his 
<A NAME="416"></A>brother; he points out what he censures in him; he lays before him what 
<A NAME="417"></A>he of himself perceives, and what the state complains of; he warns him 
<A NAME="418"></A>for the future to avoid all grounds of suspicion; he says that he pardons 
<A NAME="419"></A>the past, for the sake of his brother, Divitiacus. He sets spies over Dumnorix 
<A NAME="420"></A>that he may be able to know what he does, and with whom he 
<A NAME="421"></A>communicates.
<A NAME="422"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 21</B>
<A NAME="423"></A><BR><BR>Being on the same day informed by his scouts, that the enemy had 
<A NAME="424"></A>encamped at the foot of a mountain eight miles from his own camp; he sent 
<A NAME="425"></A>persons to ascertain what the nature of the mountain was, and of what kind 
<A NAME="426"></A>the ascent on every side. Word was brought back, that it was easy. During 
<A NAME="427"></A>the third watch he orders Titus Labienus, his lieutenant with praetorian 
<A NAME="428"></A>powers, to ascend to the highest ridge of the mountain with two legions, 
<A NAME="429"></A>and with those as guides who had examined the road; he explains what his 
<A NAME="430"></A>plan is. He himself during the fourth watch, hastens to them by the same 
<A NAME="431"></A>route by which the enemy had gone, and sends on all the cavalry before 
<A NAME="432"></A>him. Publius Considius, who was reputed to be very experienced in military 
<A NAME="433"></A>affairs, and had been in the army of Lucius Sulla, and afterward in that 
<A NAME="434"></A>of Marcus Crassus, is sent forward with the scouts.
<A NAME="435"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 22</B>
<A NAME="436"></A><BR><BR>At day-break, when the summit of the mountain was in the possession 
<A NAME="437"></A>of Titus Labienus, and he himself was not further off than a mile and half 
<A NAME="438"></A>from the enemy's camp, nor, as he afterward ascertained from the captives, 
<A NAME="439"></A>had either his arrival or that of Labienus been discovered; Considius, 
<A NAME="440"></A>with his horse at full gallop, comes up to him says that the mountain which 
<A NAME="441"></A>he [Caesar] wished should be seized by Labienus, is in possession of the 
<A NAME="442"></A>enemy; that he has discovered this by the Gallic arms and ensigns. Caesar 
<A NAME="443"></A>leads off his forces to the next hill: [and] draws them up in battle-order. 
<A NAME="444"></A>Labienus, as he had been ordered by Caesar not to come to an engagement 
<A NAME="445"></A>unless [Caesar's] own forces were seen near the enemy's camp, that the 
<A NAME="446"></A>attack upon the enemy might be made on every side at the same time, was, 
<A NAME="447"></A>after having taken possession of the mountain, waiting for our men, and 
<A NAME="448"></A>refraining from battle. When, at length, the day was far advanced, Caesar 
<A NAME="449"></A>learned through spies, that the mountain was in possession of his own men, 
<A NAME="450"></A>and that the Helvetii had moved their camp, and that Considius, struck 
<A NAME="451"></A>with fear, had reported to him, as seen, that which he had not seen. On 
<A NAME="452"></A>that day he follows the enemy at his usual distance, and pitches his camp 
<A NAME="453"></A>three miles from theirs.
<A NAME="454"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 23</B>
<A NAME="455"></A><BR><BR>The next day (as there remained in all only two day's space [to 
<A NAME="456"></A>the time] when he must serve out the corn to his army, and as he was not 
<A NAME="457"></A>more than eighteen miles from Bibracte, by far the largest and best-stored 
<A NAME="458"></A>town of the Aedui), he thought that he ought to provide for a supply of 
<A NAME="459"></A>corn; and diverted his march from the Helvetii, and advanced rapidly to 
<A NAME="460"></A>Bibracte. This circumstance is reported to the enemy by some deserters 
<A NAME="461"></A>from Lucius Aemilius, a captain, of the Gallic horse. The Helvetii, either 
<A NAME="462"></A>because they thought that the Romans, struck with terror, were retreating 
<A NAME="463"></A>from them, the more so, as the day before, though they had seized on the 
<A NAME="464"></A>higher grounds, they had not joined battle or because they flattered themselves 
<A NAME="465"></A>that they might be cut of from the provisions, altering their plan and 
<A NAME="466"></A>changing their route, began to pursue, and to annoy our men in the 
<A NAME="467"></A>rear.
<A NAME="468"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 24</B>
<A NAME="469"></A><BR><BR>Caesar, when he observes this, draws off his forces to the next 
<A NAME="470"></A>hill, and sent the cavalry to sustain the attack of the enemy. He himself, 
<A NAME="471"></A>meanwhile, drew up on the middle of the hill a triple line of his four 
<A NAME="472"></A>veteran legions in such a manner, that he placed above him on the very 
<A NAME="473"></A>summit the two legions, which he had lately levied in Hither Gaul, and 
<A NAME="474"></A>all the auxiliaries; and he ordered that the whole mountain should be covered 
<A NAME="475"></A>with men, and that meanwhile the baggage should be brought together into 
<A NAME="476"></A>one place, and the position be protected by those who were posted in the 
<A NAME="477"></A>upper line. The Helvetii having followed with all their wagons, collected 
<A NAME="478"></A>their baggage into one place: they themselves, after having repulsed our 
<A NAME="479"></A>cavalry and formed a phalanx, advanced up to our front line in very close 
<A NAME="480"></A>order.
<A NAME="481"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 25</B>
<A NAME="482"></A><BR><BR>Caesar, having removed out of sight first his own horse, then those 
<A NAME="483"></A>of all, that he might make the danger of a11 equal, and do away with the 
<A NAME="484"></A>hope of flight, after encouraging his men, joined battle. His soldiers 
<A NAME="485"></A>hurling their javelins from the higher ground, easily broke the enemy's 
<A NAME="486"></A>phalanx. That being dispersed, they made a charge on them with drawn swords. 
<A NAME="487"></A>It was a great hinderance to the Gauls in fighting, that, when several 
<A NAME="488"></A>of their bucklers had been by one stroke of the (Roman) javelins pierced 
<A NAME="489"></A>through and pinned fast together, as the point of the iron had bent itself, 
<A NAME="490"></A>they could neither pluck it out, nor, with their left hand entangled, fight 
<A NAME="491"></A>with sufficient ease; so that many, after having long tossed their arm 
<A NAME="492"></A>about, chose rather to cast away the buckler from their hand, and to fight 
<A NAME="493"></A>with their person unprotected. At length, worn out with wounds, they began 
<A NAME="494"></A>to give way, and, as there was in the neighborhood a mountain about a mile 
<A NAME="495"></A>off, to betake themselves thither. When the mountain had been gained, and 
<A NAME="496"></A>our men were advancing up, the Boii and Tulingi, who with about 15,000 
<A NAME="497"></A>men closed the enemy's line of march and served as a guard to their rear, 
<A NAME="498"></A>having assailed our men on the exposed flank as they advanced [prepared] 
<A NAME="499"></A>to surround them; upon seeing which, the Helvetii who had betaken themselves 
<A NAME="500"></A>to the mountain, began to press on again and renew the battle. The Romans 
<A NAME="501"></A>having faced about, advanced to the attack in two divisions; the first 
<A NAME="502"></A>and second line, to withstand those who had been defeated and driven off 
<A NAME="503"></A>the field; the third to receive those who were just 
<A NAME="504"></A>arriving.
<A NAME="505"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 26</B>
<A NAME="506"></A><BR><BR>Thus, was the contest long and vigorously carried on with doubtful 
<A NAME="507"></A>success. When they could no longer withstand the attacks of our men, the 
<A NAME="508"></A>one division, as they had begun to do, betook themselves to the mountain; 
<A NAME="509"></A>the other repaired to their baggage and wagons. For during the whole of 
<A NAME="510"></A>this battle, although the fight lasted from the seventh hour [i.e. 12 (noon) 
<A NAME="511"></A>1 P. M.] to eventide, no one could see an enemy with his back turned. The 
<A NAME="512"></A>fight was carried on also at the baggage till late in the night, for they 
<A NAME="513"></A>had set wagons in the way as a rampart, and from the higher ground kept 
<A NAME="514"></A>throwing weapons upon our men, as they came on, and some from between the 
<A NAME="515"></A>wagons and the wheels kept darting their lances and javelins from beneath, 
<A NAME="516"></A>and wounding our men. After the fight had lasted some time, our men gained 
<A NAME="517"></A>possession of their baggage and camp. There the daughter and one of the 
<A NAME="518"></A>sons of Orgetorix was taken. After the battle about 130,000 men [of the 
<A NAME="519"></A>enemy] remained alive, who marched incessantly during the whole of that 
<A NAME="520"></A>night; and after a march discontinued for no part of the night, arrived 
<A NAME="521"></A>in the territories of the Lingones on the fourth day, while our men, having 
<A NAME="522"></A>stopped for three days, both on account of the wounds of the soldiers and 
<A NAME="523"></A>the burial of the slain, had not been able to follow them. Caesar sent 
<A NAME="524"></A>letters and messengers to the Lingones [with orders] that they should not 
<A NAME="525"></A>assist them with corn or with any thing else; for that if they should assist 
<A NAME="526"></A>them, he would regard them in the same light as the Helvetii. After the 
<A NAME="527"></A>three days' interval he began to follow them himself with all his 
<A NAME="528"></A>forces.
<A NAME="529"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 27</B>
<A NAME="530"></A><BR><BR>The Helvetii, compelled by the want of every thing, sent embassadors 
<A NAME="531"></A>to him about a surrender. When these had met him on the way and had thrown 
<A NAME="532"></A>themselves at his feet, and speaking in suppliant tone had with tears sued 
<A NAME="533"></A>for peace, and [when] he had ordered them to await his arrival, in the 
<A NAME="534"></A>place, where they then were, they obeyed his commands. When Caesar arrived 
<A NAME="535"></A>at that place, he demanded hostages, their arms, and the slaves who had 
<A NAME="536"></A>deserted to them. While those things are being sought for and got together, 
<A NAME="537"></A>after a night's interval, about 6000 men of that canton which is called 
<A NAME="538"></A>the Verbigene, whether terrified by fear, lest after delivering up their 
<A NAME="539"></A>arms, they should suffer punishment, or else induced by the hope of safety, 
<A NAME="540"></A>because they supposed that, amid so vast a multitude of those who had surrendered 
<A NAME="541"></A>themselves, their flight might either be concealed or entirely overlooked, 
<A NAME="542"></A>having at night-fall departed out of the camp of the Helvetii, hastened 
<A NAME="543"></A>to the Rhine and the territories of the Germans.
<A NAME="544"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 28</B>
<A NAME="545"></A><BR><BR>But when Caesar discovered this, he commanded those through whose 
<A NAME="546"></A>territory they had gone, to seek them out and to bring them back again, 
<A NAME="547"></A>if they meant to be acquitted before him; and considered them, when brought 
<A NAME="548"></A>back, in the light of enemies; he admitted all the rest to a surrender, 
<A NAME="549"></A>upon their delivering up the hostages, arms, and deserters. He ordered 
<A NAME="550"></A>the Helvetii, the Tulingi, and the Latobrigi, to return to their territories 
<A NAME="551"></A>from which they had come, and as there was at home nothing whereby they 
<A NAME="552"></A>might support their hunger, all the productions of the earth having been 
<A NAME="553"></A>destroyed, he commanded the Allobroges to let them have a plentiful supply 
<A NAME="554"></A>of corn; and ordered them to rebuild the towns and villages which they 
<A NAME="555"></A>had burned. This he did, chiefly, on this account, because he was unwilling 
<A NAME="556"></A>that the country, from which the Helvetii had departed, should be untenanted, 
<A NAME="557"></A>lest the Germans, who dwell on the other side of the Rhine, should, on 
<A NAME="558"></A>account of the excellence of the lands, cross over from their own territories 
<A NAME="559"></A>into those of the Helvetii, and become borderers upon the province of Gaul 
<A NAME="560"></A>and the Allobroges. He granted the petition of the Aedui, that they might 
<A NAME="561"></A>settle the Boii, in their own (i. e. in the Aeduan) territories, as these 
<A NAME="562"></A>were known to be of distinguished valor, to whom they gave lands, and whom 
<A NAME="563"></A>they afterward admitted to the same state of rights and freedom as 
<A NAME="564"></A>themselves.
<A NAME="565"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 29</B>
<A NAME="566"></A><BR><BR>In the camp of the Helvetii, lists were found, drawn up in Greek 
<A NAME="567"></A>characters, and were brought to Caesar, in which an estimate had been drawn 
<A NAME="568"></A>up, name by name, of the number which had gone forth from their country 
<A NAME="569"></A>of those who were able to bear arms; and likewise the boys, the old men, 
<A NAME="570"></A>and the women, separately. Of all which items the total was: Of the Helvetii 
<A NAME="571"></A>[lit. of the heads of the Helvetii] 263,000 Of the Tulingi . . . . . . 
<A NAME="572"></A>. . . . . 36,000 Of the Latobrigi .- . . . . . . . . . . 14,000 Of the 
<A NAME="573"></A>Rauraci . . . . . . . . . . . 23,000 Of the Boii . . . . . . . . . . . 
<A NAME="574"></A>. . 32,000 The sum of all amounted to . . . 368,000. Out of these, such 
<A NAME="575"></A>as could bear arms, [amounted] to about 92,000. When the census of those 
<A NAME="576"></A>who returned home was taken, as Caesar had commanded, the number was found 
<A NAME="577"></A>to be 110,000.
<A NAME="578"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 30</B>
<A NAME="579"></A><BR><BR>When the war with the Helvetii was concluded, embassadors from 
<A NAME="580"></A>almost all parts of Gaul, the chiefs of states, assembled to congratulate 
<A NAME="581"></A>Caesar, [saying] that they were well aware, that, although he had taken 
<A NAME="582"></A>vengeance on the Helvetii in war, for the old wrong done by them to the 
<A NAME="583"></A>Roman people, yet that circumstance had happened no less to the benefit 
<A NAME="584"></A>of the land of Gaul than of the Roman people, because the Helvetii, while 
<A NAME="585"></A>their affairs were most flourishing, had quitted their country with the 
<A NAME="586"></A>design of making war upon the whole of Gaul, and seizing the government 
<A NAME="587"></A>of it, and selecting, out of a great abundance, that spot for an abode, 
<A NAME="588"></A>which they should judge to be the most convenient and most productive of 
<A NAME="589"></A>all Gaul, and hold the rest of the states as tributaries. They requested 
<A NAME="590"></A>that they might be allowed to proclaim an assembly of the whole of Gaul 
<A NAME="591"></A>for a particular day, and to do that with Caesar's permission, [stating] 
<A NAME="592"></A>that they had some things which, with the general consent, they wished 
<A NAME="593"></A>to ask of him. This request having been granted, they appointed a day for 
<A NAME="594"></A>the assembly, and ordained by an oath with each other, that no one should 
<A NAME="595"></A>disclose [their deliberations] except those to whom this [office] should 
<A NAME="596"></A>be assigned by the general assembly.
<A NAME="597"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 31</B>
<A NAME="598"></A><BR><BR>When that assembly was dismissed, the same chiefs of states, who 
<A NAME="599"></A>had before been to Caesar, returned, and asked that they might be allowed 
<A NAME="600"></A>to treat with him privately (in secret) concerning the safety of themselves 
<A NAME="601"></A>and of all. That request having been obtained, they all threw themselves 
<A NAME="602"></A>in tears at Caesar's feet, [saying] that they no less begged and earnestly 
<A NAME="603"></A>desired that what they might say should not be disclosed, than that they 
<A NAME="604"></A>might obtain those things which they wished for; inasmuch as they saw, 
<A NAME="605"></A>that, if a disclosure was made, they should be put to the greatest tortures. 
<A NAME="606"></A>For these Divitiacus the Aeduan spoke and told him: "That there were two 
<A NAME="607"></A>parties in the whole of Gaul: that the Aedui stood at the head of one of 
<A NAME="608"></A>these, the Arverni of the other. After these had been violently struggling 
<A NAME="609"></A>with one another for the superiority for many years, it came to pass that 
<A NAME="610"></A>the Germans were called in for hire by the Arverni and the Sequani. That 
<A NAME="611"></A>about 15,000 of them [i.e. of the Germans] had at first crossed the Rhine: 
<A NAME="612"></A>but after that these wild and savage men had become enamored of the lands 
<A NAME="613"></A>and the refinement and the abundance of the Gauls, more were brought over, 
<A NAME="614"></A>that there were now as many as 120,000 of them in Gaul: that with these 
<A NAME="615"></A>the Aedui and their dependents had repeatedly struggled in arms - that 
<A NAME="616"></A>they had been routed, and had sustained a great calamity - had lost all 
<A NAME="617"></A>their nobility, all their senate, all their cavalry. And that broken by 
<A NAME="618"></A>such engagements and calamities, although they had formerly been very powerful 
<A NAME="619"></A>in Gaul, both from their own valor and from the Roman people's hospitality 
<A NAME="620"></A>and friendship, they were now compelled to give the chief nobles of their 
<A NAME="621"></A>state, as hostages to the Sequani, and to bind their state by an oath, 
<A NAME="622"></A>that they would neither demand hostages in return, nor supplicate aid from 
<A NAME="623"></A>the Roman people, nor refuse to be forever under their sway and empire. 
<A NAME="624"></A>That he was the only one out of all the state of the Aedui, who could not 
<A NAME="625"></A>be prevailed upon to take the oath or to give his children as hostages. 
<A NAME="626"></A>On that account he had fled from his state and had gone to the senate at 
<A NAME="627"></A>Rome to beseech aid, as he alone was bound neither by oath nor hostages. 
<A NAME="628"></A>But a worse thing had befallen the victorious Sequani than the vanquished 
<A NAME="629"></A>Aedui, for Ariovistus the king of the Germans, had settled in their territories, 
<A NAME="630"></A>and had seized upon a third of their land, which was the best in the whole 
<A NAME="631"></A>of Gaul, and was now ordering them to depart from another third part, because 
<A NAME="632"></A>a few months previously 24,000 men of the Harudes had come to him, for 
<A NAME="633"></A>whom room and settlements must be provided. The consequence would be, that 
<A NAME="634"></A>in a few years they would all be driven from the territories of Gaul, and 
<A NAME="635"></A>all the Germans would cross the Rhine; for neither must the land of Gaul 
<A NAME="636"></A>be compared with the land of the Germans, nor must the habit of living 
<A NAME="637"></A>of the latter be put on a level with that of the former. Moreover, [as 
<A NAME="638"></A>for] Ariovistus, no sooner did he defeat the forces of the Gauls in a battle 
<A NAME="639"></A>which took place at Magetobria, than [he began] to lord it haughtily and 
<A NAME="640"></A>cruelly, to demand as hostages the children of all the principal nobles, 
<A NAME="641"></A>and wreak on them every kind of cruelty, if every thing was not done at 
<A NAME="642"></A>his nod or pleasure; that he was a savage, passionate, and reckless man, 
<A NAME="643"></A>and that his commands could no longer be borne. Unless there was some aid 
<A NAME="644"></A>in Caesar and the Roman people, the Gauls must all do the same thing that 
<A NAME="645"></A>the Helvetii have done, [viz.] emigrate from their country, and seek another 
<A NAME="646"></A>dwelling place, other settlements remote from the Germans, and try whatever 
<A NAME="647"></A>fortune may fall to their lot. If these things were to be disclosed to 
<A NAME="648"></A>Ariovistus, [Divitiacus adds] that he doubts not that he would inflict 
<A NAME="649"></A>the most severe punishment on all the hostages who are in his possession, 
<A NAME="650"></A>[and says] that Caesar could, either by his own influence and by that of 
<A NAME="651"></A>his army, or by his late victory, or by name of the Roman people, intimidate 
<A NAME="652"></A>him, so as to prevent a greater number of Germans being brought over the 
<A NAME="653"></A>Rhine, and could protect all Gaul from the outrages of 
<A NAME="654"></A>Ariovistus.
<A NAME="655"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 32</B>
<A NAME="656"></A><BR><BR>When this speech had been delivered by Divitiacus, all who were 
<A NAME="657"></A>present began with loud lamentation to entreat assistance of Caesar. Caesar 
<A NAME="658"></A>noticed that the Sequani were the only people of all who did none of those 
<A NAME="659"></A>things which the others did, but, with their heads bowed down, gazed on 
<A NAME="660"></A>the earth in sadness. Wondering what was the reason of this conduct, he 
<A NAME="661"></A>inquired of themselves. No reply did the Sequani make, but silently continued 
<A NAME="662"></A>in the same sadness. When he had repeatedly inquired of them and could 
<A NAME="663"></A>not elicit any answer at all, the same Divitiacus the Aeduan answered, 
<A NAME="664"></A>that - "the lot of the Sequani was more wretched and grievous than that 
<A NAME="665"></A>of the rest, on this account, because they alone durst not even in secret 
<A NAME="666"></A>complain or supplicate aid; and shuddered at the cruelty of Ariovistus 
<A NAME="667"></A>[even when] absent, just as if he were present; for, to the rest, despite 
<A NAME="668"></A>of every thing there was an opportunity of flight given; but all tortures 
<A NAME="669"></A>must be endured by the Sequani, who had admitted Ariovistus within their 
<A NAME="670"></A>territories, and whose towns were all in his power."
<A NAME="671"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 33</B>
<A NAME="672"></A><BR><BR>Caesar, on being informed of these things, cheered the minds of 
<A NAME="673"></A>the Gauls with his words, and promised that this affair should be an object 
<A NAME="674"></A>of his concern, [saying] that he had great hopes that Ariovistus, induced 
<A NAME="675"></A>both by his kindness and his power, would put an end to his oppression. 
<A NAME="676"></A>After delivering this speech, he dismissed the assembly; and, besides those 
<A NAME="677"></A>statements, many circumstances induced him to think that this affair ought 
<A NAME="678"></A>to be considered and taken up by him; especially as he saw that the Aedui, 
<A NAME="679"></A>styled [as they had been] repeatedly by the senate "brethren" and "kinsmen," 
<A NAME="680"></A>were held in the thraldom and dominion of the Germans, and understood that 
<A NAME="681"></A>their hostages were with Ariovistus and the Sequani, which in so mighty 
<A NAME="682"></A>an empire [as that] of the Roman people he considered very disgraceful 
<A NAME="683"></A>to himself and the republic. That, moreover, the Germans should by degrees 
<A NAME="684"></A>become accustomed to cross the Rhine, and that a great body of them should 
<A NAME="685"></A>come into Gaul, he saw [would be] dangerous to the Roman people, and judged, 
<A NAME="686"></A>that wild and savage men would not be likely to restrain themselves, after 
<A NAME="687"></A>they had possessed themselves of all Gaul, from going forth into the province 
<A NAME="688"></A>and thence marching into Italy (as the Cimbri and Teutones had done before 
<A NAME="689"></A>them), particularly as the Rhone [was the sole barrier that] separated 
<A NAME="690"></A>the Sequani from our province. Against which events he thought he ought 
<A NAME="691"></A>to provide as speedily as possible. Moreover, Ariovistus, for his part, 
<A NAME="692"></A>had assumed to himself such pride and arrogance, that he was felt to be 
<A NAME="693"></A>quite insufferable.
<A NAME="694"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 34</B>
<A NAME="695"></A><BR><BR>He therefore determined to send embassadors to Ariovistus to demand 
<A NAME="696"></A>of him to name some intermediate spot for a conference between the two, 
<A NAME="697"></A>[saying] that he wished to treat him on state-business and matters of the 
<A NAME="698"></A>highest importance to both of them. To this embassy Ariovistus replied, 
<A NAME="699"></A>that if he himself had had need of any thing from Caesar, he would have 
<A NAME="700"></A>gone to him; and that if Caesar wanted any thing from him he ought to come 
<A NAME="701"></A>to him. That, besides, neither dare he go without an army into those parts 
<A NAME="702"></A>of Gaul which Caesar had possession of, nor could he, without great expense 
<A NAME="703"></A>and trouble, draw his army together to one place; that to him, moreover, 
<A NAME="704"></A>it appeared strange, what business either Caesar or the Roman people at 
<A NAME="705"></A>all had in his own Gaul, which he had conquered in war.
<A NAME="706"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 35</B>
<A NAME="707"></A><BR><BR>When these answers were reported to Caesar, he sends embassadors 
<A NAME="708"></A>to him a second time with this message. "Since, after having been treated 
<A NAME="709"></A>with so much kindness by himself and the Roman people (as he had in his 
<A NAME="710"></A>consulship been styled 'king and friend' by the senate), he makes this 
<A NAME="711"></A>recompense to [Caesar] himself and the Roman people, [viz.] that when invited 
<A NAME="712"></A>to a conference he demurs, and does not think that it concerns him to advise 
<A NAME="713"></A>and inform himself about an object of mutual interest, these are the things 
<A NAME="714"></A>which he requires of him; first, that he do not any more bring over any 
<A NAME="715"></A>body of men across the Rhine into Gaul; in the next place, that he restore 
<A NAME="716"></A>the hostages, which he has from the Aedui, and grant the Sequani permission 
<A NAME="717"></A>to restore to them with his consent those hostages which they have, and 
<A NAME="718"></A>that he neither provoke the Aedui by outrage nor make war upon them or 
<A NAME="719"></A>their allies; if he would accordingly do this," [Caesar says] that "he 
<A NAME="720"></A>himself and the Roman people will entertain a perpetual feeling of favor 
<A NAME="721"></A>and friendship toward him; but that if he [Caesar] does not obtain [his 
<A NAME="722"></A>desires] that he (forasmuch as in the consulship of Marcus Messala and 
<A NAME="723"></A>Marcus Piso the senate had decreed that, whoever should have the administration 
<A NAME="724"></A>of the province of Gaul should, as far as he could do so consistently with 
<A NAME="725"></A>the interests of the republic, protect the Aedui and the other friends 
<A NAME="726"></A>of the Roman people), will not overlook the wrongs of the 
<A NAME="727"></A>Aedui."
<A NAME="728"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 36</B>
<A NAME="729"></A><BR><BR>To this Ariovistus replied, that "the right of war was, that they 
<A NAME="730"></A>who had conquered should govern those whom they had conquered, in what 
<A NAME="731"></A>manner they pleased; that in that way the Roman people were wont to govern 
<A NAME="732"></A>the nations which they had conquered, not according to the dictation of 
<A NAME="733"></A>any other, but according to their own discretion. If he for his part did 
<A NAME="734"></A>not dictate to the Roman people as to the manner in which they were to 
<A NAME="735"></A>exercise their right, he ought not to be obstructed by the Roman people 
<A NAME="736"></A>in his right; that the Aedui, inasmuch as they had tried the fortune of 
<A NAME="737"></A>war and had engaged in arms and been conquered, had become tributaries 
<A NAME="738"></A>to him; that Caesar was doing a great injustice, in that by his arrival 
<A NAME="739"></A>he was making his revenues less valuable to him; that he should not restore 
<A NAME="740"></A>their hostages to the Aedui, but should not make war wrongfully either 
<A NAME="741"></A>upon them or their allies, if they abided by that which had been agreed 
<A NAME="742"></A>on, and paid their tribute annually: if they did not continue to do that, 
<A NAME="743"></A>the Roman people's name of 'brothers' would avail them naught. As to Caesar's 
<A NAME="744"></A>threatening him, that he would not overlook the wrongs of the Aedui, [he 
<A NAME="745"></A>said] that no one had ever entered into a contest with him [Ariovistus] 
<A NAME="746"></A>without utter ruin to himself. That Caesar might enter the lists when he 
<A NAME="747"></A>chose; he would feel what the invincible Germans, well-trained [as they 
<A NAME="748"></A>were] beyond all others to arms, who for fourteen years had not been beneath 
<A NAME="749"></A>a roof, could achieve by their valor."
<A NAME="750"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 37</B>
<A NAME="751"></A><BR><BR>At the same time that this message was delivered to Caesar, embassadors 
<A NAME="752"></A>came from the Aedui and the Treviri; from the Aedui to complain that the 
<A NAME="753"></A>Harudes, who had lately been brought over into Gaul, were ravaging their 
<A NAME="754"></A>territories; that they had not been able to purchase peace from Ariovistus, 
<A NAME="755"></A>even by giving hostages: and from the Treviri, [to state] that a hundred 
<A NAME="756"></A>cantons of the Suevi had encamped on the banks of the Rhine, and were attempting 
<A NAME="757"></A>to cross it; that the brothers, Nasuas and Cimberius, headed them. Being 
<A NAME="758"></A>greatly alarmed at these things, Caesar thought that he ought to use all 
<A NAME="759"></A>dispatch, lest, if this new band of Suevi should unite with the old troops 
<A NAME="760"></A>of Ariovistus, he [Ariovistus] might be less easily withstood. Having therefore, 
<A NAME="761"></A>as quickly as he could, provided a supply of corn, he hastened to Ariovistus 
<A NAME="762"></A>by forced marches.
<A NAME="763"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 38</B>
<A NAME="764"></A><BR><BR>When he had proceeded three days' journey, word was brought to 
<A NAME="765"></A>him that Ariovistus was hastening with all his forces to seize on Vesontio, 
<A NAME="766"></A>which is the largest town of the Sequani, and had advanced three days' 
<A NAME="767"></A>journey from its territories. Caesar thought that he ought to take the 
<A NAME="768"></A>greatest precautions lest this should happen, for there was in that town 
<A NAME="769"></A>a most ample supply of every thing which was serviceable for war; and so 
<A NAME="770"></A>fortified was it by the nature of the ground, as to afford a great facility 
<A NAME="771"></A>for protracting the war, inasmuch as the river Doubs almost surrounds the 
<A NAME="772"></A>whole town, as though it were traced round it with a pair of compasses. 
<A NAME="773"></A>A mountain of great height shuts in the remaining space, which is not more 
<A NAME="774"></A>than 600 feet, where the river leaves a gap, in such a manner that the 
<A NAME="775"></A>roots of that mountain extend to the river's bank on either side. A wall 
<A NAME="776"></A>thrown around it makes a citadel of this [mountain], and connects it with 
<A NAME="777"></A>the town. Hither Caesar hastens by forced marches by night and day, and, 
<A NAME="778"></A>after having seized the town, stations a garrison there.
<A NAME="779"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 39</B>
<A NAME="780"></A><BR><BR>While he is tarrying a few days at Vesontio, on account of corn 
<A NAME="781"></A>and provisions; from the inquiries of our men and the reports of the Gauls 
<A NAME="782"></A>and traders (who asserted that the Germans were men of huge stature, of 
<A NAME="783"></A>incredible valor and practice in arms - that oftentimes they, on encountering 
<A NAME="784"></A>them, could not bear even their countenance, and the fierceness of their 
<A NAME="785"></A>eyes) - so great a panic on a sudden seized the whole army, as to discompose 
<A NAME="786"></A>the minds and spirits of all in no slight degree. This first arose from 
<A NAME="787"></A>the tribunes of the soldiers, the prefects and the rest, who, having followed 
<A NAME="788"></A>Caesar from the city [Rome] from motives of friendship, had no great experience 
<A NAME="789"></A>in military affairs. And alleging, some of them one reason, some another, 
<A NAME="790"></A>which they said made it necessary for them to depart, they requested that 
<A NAME="791"></A>by his consent they might be allowed to withdraw; some, influenced by shame, 
<A NAME="792"></A>stayed behind in order that they might avoid the suspicion of cowardice. 
<A NAME="793"></A>These could neither compose their countenance, nor even sometimes check 
<A NAME="794"></A>their tears: but hidden in their tents, either bewailed their fate, or 
<A NAME="795"></A>deplored with their comrades the general danger. Wills were sealed universally 
<A NAME="796"></A>throughout the whole camp. By the expressions and cowardice of these men, 
<A NAME="797"></A>even those who possessed great experience in the camp, both soldiers and 
<A NAME="798"></A>centurions, and those [the decurions] who were in command of the cavalry, 
<A NAME="799"></A>were gradually disconcerted. Such of them as wished to be considered less 
<A NAME="800"></A>alarmed, said that they did not dread the enemy, but feared the narrowness 
<A NAME="801"></A>of the roads and the vastness of the forests which lay between them and 
<A NAME="802"></A>Ariovistus, or else that the supplies could not be brought up readily enough. 
<A NAME="803"></A>Some even declared to Caesar, that when he gave orders for the camp to 
<A NAME="804"></A>be moved and the troops to advance, the soldiers would not be obedient 
<A NAME="805"></A>to the command, nor advance in consequence of their 
<A NAME="806"></A>fear.
<A NAME="807"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 40</B>
<A NAME="808"></A><BR><BR>When Caesar observed these things, having called a council, and 
<A NAME="809"></A>summoned to it the centurions of all the companies, he severely reprimanded 
<A NAME="810"></A>them, "particularly, for supposing that it belonged to them to inquire 
<A NAME="811"></A>or conjecture, either in what direction they were marching, or with what 
<A NAME="812"></A>object. That Ariovistus, during his [Caesar's] consulship, had most anxiously 
<A NAME="813"></A>sought after the friendship of the Roman people; why should any one judge 
<A NAME="814"></A>that he would so rashly depart from his duty? He for his part was persuaded, 
<A NAME="815"></A>that, when his demands were known and the fairness of the terms considered, 
<A NAME="816"></A>he would reject neither his nor the Roman people's favor. But even if, 
<A NAME="817"></A>driven on by rage and madness, he should make war upon them, what after 
<A NAME="818"></A>all were they afraid of? - or why should they despair either of their own 
<A NAME="819"></A>valor or of his zeal? Of that enemy a trial had been made within our fathers' 
<A NAME="820"></A>recollection, when, on the defeat of the Cimbri and Teutones by Caius Marius, 
<A NAME="821"></A>the army was regarded as having deserved no less praise than their commander 
<A NAME="822"></A>himself. It had been made lately, too, in Italy, during the rebellion of 
<A NAME="823"></A>the slaves, whom, however, the experience and training which they had received 
<A NAME="824"></A>from us, assisted in some respect. From which a judgment might be formed 
<A NAME="825"></A>of the advantages which resolution carries with it inasmuch as those whom 
<A NAME="826"></A>for some time they had groundlessly dreaded when unarmed, they had afterward 
<A NAME="827"></A>vanquished, when well armed and flushed with success. In short, that these 
<A NAME="828"></A>were the same men whom the Helvetii, in frequent encounters, not only in 
<A NAME="829"></A>their own territories, but also in theirs [the German], have generally 
<A NAME="830"></A>vanquished, and yet can not have been a match for our army. If the unsuccessful 
<A NAME="831"></A>battle and flight of the Gauls disquieted any, these, if they made inquiries, 
<A NAME="832"></A>might discover that, when the Gauls had been tired out by the long duration 
<A NAME="833"></A>of the war, Ariovistus, after he had many months kept himself in his camp 
<A NAME="834"></A>and in the marshes, and had given no opportunity for an engagement, fell 
<A NAME="835"></A>suddenly upon them, by this time despairing of a battle and scattered in 
<A NAME="836"></A>all directions, and was victorious more through stratagem and cunning than 
<A NAME="837"></A>valor. But though there had been room for such stratagem against savage 
<A NAME="838"></A>and unskilled men, not even [Ariovistus] himself expected that thereby 
<A NAME="839"></A>our armies could be entrapped. That those who ascribed their fear to a 
<A NAME="840"></A>pretense about the [deficiency of] supplies and the narrowness of the roads, 
<A NAME="841"></A>acted presumptuously, as they seemed either to distrust their general's 
<A NAME="842"></A>discharge of his duty, or to dictate to him. That these things were his 
<A NAME="843"></A>concern; that the Sequani, the Leuci, and the Lingones were to furnish 
<A NAME="844"></A>the corn; and that it was already ripe in the fields; that as to the road 
<A NAME="845"></A>they would soon be able to judge for themselves. As to its being reported 
<A NAME="846"></A>that the soldiers would not be obedient to command, or advance, he was 
<A NAME="847"></A>not at all disturbed at that; for he knew, that in the case of all those 
<A NAME="848"></A>whose army had not been obedient to command, either upon some mismanagement 
<A NAME="849"></A>of an affair, fortune had deserted them, or, that upon some crime being 
<A NAME="850"></A>discovered, covetousness had been clearly proved [against them]. His integrity 
<A NAME="851"></A>had been seen throughout his whole life, his good fortune in the war with 
<A NAME="852"></A>the Helvetii. That he would therefore instantly set about what he had intended 
<A NAME="853"></A>to put off till a more distant day, and would break up his camp the next 
<A NAME="854"></A>night, in the fourth watch, that he might ascertain, as soon as possible, 
<A NAME="855"></A>whether a sense of honor and duty, or whether fear had more influence with 
<A NAME="856"></A>them. But that, if no one else should follow, yet he would go with only 
<A NAME="857"></A>the tenth legion, of which he had no misgivings, and it should be his praetorian 
<A NAME="858"></A>cohort." This legion Caesar had both greatly favored, and in it, on account 
<A NAME="859"></A>of its valor, placed the greatest confidence.
<A NAME="860"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 41</B>
<A NAME="861"></A><BR><BR>Upon the delivery of this speech, the minds of all were changed 
<A NAME="862"></A>in a surprising manner, and the highest ardor and eagerness for prosecuting 
<A NAME="863"></A>the war were engendered; and the tenth legion was the first to return thanks 
<A NAME="864"></A>to him, through their military tribunes, for his having expressed this 
<A NAME="865"></A>most favorable opinion of them; and assured him that they were quite ready 
<A NAME="866"></A>to prosecute the war. Then, the other legions endeavored, through their 
<A NAME="867"></A>military tribunes and the centurions of the principal companies, to excuse 
<A NAME="868"></A>themselves to Caesar, [saying] that they had never either doubted or feared, 
<A NAME="869"></A>or supposed that the determination of the conduct of the war was theirs 
<A NAME="870"></A>and not their general's. Having accepted their excuse, and having had the 
<A NAME="871"></A>road carefully reconnoitered by Divitiacus, because in him of all others 
<A NAME="872"></A>he had the greatest faith [he found] that by a circuitous route of more 
<A NAME="873"></A>than fifty miles he might lead his army through open parts; he then set 
<A NAME="874"></A>out in the fourth watch, as he had said [he would]. On the seventh day, 
<A NAME="875"></A>as he did not discontinue his march, he was informed by scouts that the 
<A NAME="876"></A>forces of Ariovistus were only four and twenty miles distant from 
<A NAME="877"></A>ours.
<A NAME="878"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 42</B>
<A NAME="879"></A><BR><BR>Upon being apprized of Caesar's arrival, Ariovistus sends embassadors 
<A NAME="880"></A>to him, [saying] that what he had before requested as to a conference, 
<A NAME="881"></A>might now, as far as his permission went, take place, since he [Caesar] 
<A NAME="882"></A>had approached nearer, and he considered that he might now do it without 
<A NAME="883"></A>danger. Caesar did not reject the proposal and began to think that he was 
<A NAME="884"></A>now returning to a rational state of mind as he spontaneously proffered 
<A NAME="885"></A>that which he had previously refused to him when requesting it; and was 
<A NAME="886"></A>in great hopes that, in consideration of his own and the Roman people's 
<A NAME="887"></A>great favors toward him, the issue would be that he would desist from his 
<A NAME="888"></A>obstinacy upon his demands being made known. The fifth day after that was 
<A NAME="889"></A>appointed as the day of conference. Meanwhile, as ambassadors were being 
<A NAME="890"></A>often sent to and fro between them, Ariovistus demanded that Caesar should 
<A NAME="891"></A>not bring any foot-soldier with him to the conference, [saying] that "he 
<A NAME="892"></A>was afraid of being ensnared by him through treachery; that both should 
<A NAME="893"></A>come accompanied by cavalry; that he would not come on any other condition." 
<A NAME="894"></A>Caesar, as he neither wished that the conference should, by an excuse thrown 
<A NAME="895"></A>in the way, be set aside, nor durst trust his life to the cavalry of the 
<A NAME="896"></A>Gauls, decided that it would be most expedient to take away from the Gallic 
<A NAME="897"></A>cavalry all their horses, and thereon to mount the legionary soldiers of 
<A NAME="898"></A>the tenth legion, in which he placed the greatest confidence, in order 
<A NAME="899"></A>that he might have a body-guard as trustworthy as possible, should there 
<A NAME="900"></A>be any need for action. And when this was done, one of the soldiers of 
<A NAME="901"></A>the tenth legion said, not without a touch of humor, "that Caesar did more 
<A NAME="902"></A>for them than he had promised; he had promised to have the tenth legion 
<A NAME="903"></A>in place of his praetorian cohort; but he now converted them into 
<A NAME="904"></A>horse."
<A NAME="905"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 43</B>
<A NAME="906"></A><BR><BR>There was a large plain, and in it a mound of earth of considerable 
<A NAME="907"></A>size. This spot was at nearly an equal distance from both camps. Thither, 
<A NAME="908"></A>as had been appointed, they came for the conference. Caesar stationed the 
<A NAME="909"></A>legion, which he had brought [with him] on horseback, 200 paces from this 
<A NAME="910"></A>mound. The cavalry of Ariovistus also took their stand at an equal distance. 
<A NAME="911"></A>Ariovistus then demanded that they should confer on horseback, and that, 
<A NAME="912"></A>besides themselves, they should bring with them ten men each to the conference. 
<A NAME="913"></A>When they were come to the place, Caesar, in the opening of his speech, 
<A NAME="914"></A>detailed his own and the senate's favors toward him [Ariovistus], in that 
<A NAME="915"></A>he had been styled king, in that [he had been styled] friend, by the senate 
<A NAME="916"></A>- in that very considerable presents had been sent him; which circumstance 
<A NAME="917"></A>he informed him had both fallen to the lot of few, and had usually been 
<A NAME="918"></A>bestowed in consideration of important personal services; that he, although 
<A NAME="919"></A>he had neither an introduction, nor a just ground for the request, had 
<A NAME="920"></A>obtained these honors through the kindness and munificence of himself [Caesar] 
<A NAME="921"></A>and the senate. He informed him too, how old and how just were the grounds 
<A NAME="922"></A>of connection that existed between themselves [the Romans] and the Aedui, 
<A NAME="923"></A>what decrees of the senate had been passed in their favor, and how frequent 
<A NAME="924"></A>and how honorable; how from time immemorial the Aedui had held the supremacy 
<A NAME="925"></A>of the whole of Gaul; even [said Caesar] before they had sought our friendship; 
<A NAME="926"></A>that it was the custom of the Roman people to desire not only that its 
<A NAME="927"></A>allies and friends should lose none of their property, but be advanced 
<A NAME="928"></A>in influence, dignity, and honor: who then could endure that what they 
<A NAME="929"></A>had brought with them to the friendship of the Roman people should be torn 
<A NAME="930"></A>from them?" He then made the same demands which he had commissioned the 
<A NAME="931"></A>embassadors to make, that [Ariovistus] should not make war either upon 
<A NAME="932"></A>the Aedui or their allies, that he should restore the hostages; that if 
<A NAME="933"></A>he could not send back to their country any part of the Germans, he should 
<A NAME="934"></A>at all events suffer none of them any more to cross the 
<A NAME="935"></A>Rhine.
<A NAME="936"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 44</B>
<A NAME="937"></A><BR><BR>Ariovistus briefly replied to the demands of Caesar; but expatiated 
<A NAME="938"></A>largely on his own virtues, "that he had crossed the Rhine not of his own 
<A NAME="939"></A>accord, but on being invited and sent for by the Gauls; that he had not 
<A NAME="940"></A>left home and kindred without great expectations and great rewards; that 
<A NAME="941"></A>he had settlements in Gaul, granted by the Gauls themselves; that the hostages 
<A NAME="942"></A>had been given by their good-will; that he took by right of war the tribute 
<A NAME="943"></A>which conquerors are accustomed to impose on the conquered; that he had 
<A NAME="944"></A>not made war upon the Gauls, but the Gauls upon him; that all the states 
<A NAME="945"></A>of Gaul came to attack him, and had encamped against him; that all their 
<A NAME="946"></A>forces had been routed and beaten by him in a single battle; that if they 
<A NAME="947"></A>chose to make a second trial, he was ready to encounter them again; but 
<A NAME="948"></A>if they chose to enjoy peace, it was unfair to refuse the tribute, which 
<A NAME="949"></A>of their own free-will they had paid up to that time. That the friendship 
<A NAME="950"></A>of the Roman people ought to prove to him an ornament and a safeguard, 
<A NAME="951"></A>not a detriment; and that he sought it with that expectation. But if through 
<A NAME="952"></A>the Roman people the tribute was to be discontinued, and those who surrendered 
<A NAME="953"></A>to be seduced from him, he would renounce the friendship of the Roman people 
<A NAME="954"></A>no less heartily than he had sought it. As to his leading over a host of 
<A NAME="955"></A>Germans into Gaul, that he was doing this with a view of securing himself, 
<A NAME="956"></A>not of assaulting Gaul: that there was evidence of this, in that he did 
<A NAME="957"></A>not come without being invited, and in that he did not make war, but merely 
<A NAME="958"></A>warded it off. That he had come into Gaul before the Roman people. That 
<A NAME="959"></A>never before this time did a Roman army go beyond the frontiers of the 
<A NAME="960"></A>province of Gaul. What [said he] does [Caesar] desire? - why come into 
<A NAME="961"></A>his [Ariovistus] domains? - that this was his province of Gaul, just as 
<A NAME="962"></A>that is ours. As it ought not to be pardoned in him, if he were to make 
<A NAME="963"></A>an attack upon our territories; so, likewise, that we were unjust, to obstruct 
<A NAME="964"></A>him in his prerogative. As for Caesar's saying that the Aedui had been 
<A NAME="965"></A>styled 'brethren' by the senate, he was not so uncivilized nor so ignorant 
<A NAME="966"></A>of affairs, as not to know that the Aedui in the very last war with the 
<A NAME="967"></A>Allobroges had neither rendered assistance to the Romans, nor received 
<A NAME="968"></A>any from the Roman people in the struggles which the Aedui had been maintaining 
<A NAME="969"></A>with him and with the Sequani. He must feel suspicious, that Caesar, though 
<A NAME="970"></A>feigning friendship as the reason for his keeping an army in Gaul, was 
<A NAME="971"></A>keeping it with the view of crushing him. And that unless he depart and 
<A NAME="972"></A>withdraw his army from these parts, he shall regard him not as a friend, 
<A NAME="973"></A>but as a foe; and that, even if he should put him to death, he should do 
<A NAME="974"></A>what would please many of the nobles and leading men of the Roman people; 
<A NAME="975"></A>he had assurance of that from themselves through their messengers, and 
<A NAME="976"></A>could purchase the favor and the friendship of them all by his [Caesar's] 
<A NAME="977"></A>death. But if he would depart and resign to him the free possession of 
<A NAME="978"></A>Gaul, he would recompense him with a great reward, and would bring to a 
<A NAME="979"></A>close whatever wars he wished to be carried on, without any trouble or 
<A NAME="980"></A>risk to him."
<A NAME="981"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 45</B>
<A NAME="982"></A><BR><BR>Many things were stated by Caesar to the effect [to show]; "why 
<A NAME="983"></A>he could not waive the business, and that neither his nor the Roman people's 
<A NAME="984"></A>practice would suffer him to abandon most meritorious allies, nor did he 
<A NAME="985"></A>deem that Gaul belonged to Ariovistus rather than to the Roman people; 
<A NAME="986"></A>that the Arverni and the Ruteni had been subdued in war by Quintus Fabius 
<A NAME="987"></A>Maximus, and that the Roman people had pardoned them and had not reduced 
<A NAME="988"></A>them into a province or imposed a tribute upon them. And if the most ancient 
<A NAME="989"></A>period was to be regarded - then was the sovereignty of the Roman people 
<A NAME="990"></A>in Gaul most just: if the decree of the Senate was to be observed, then 
<A NAME="991"></A>ought Gaul to be free, which they [the Romans] had conquered in war, and 
<A NAME="992"></A>had permitted to enjoy its own laws."
<A NAME="993"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 46</B>
<A NAME="994"></A><BR><BR>While these things are being transacted in the conference it was 
<A NAME="995"></A>announced to Caesar that the cavalry of Ariovistus were approaching nearer 
<A NAME="996"></A>the mound, and were riding up to our men, and casting stones and weapons 
<A NAME="997"></A>at them. Caesar made an end of his speech and betook himself to his men; 
<A NAME="998"></A>and commanded them that they should by no means return a weapon upon the 
<A NAME="999"></A>enemy. For though he saw that an engagement with the cavalry would be without 
<A NAME="1000"></A>any danger to his chosen legion, yet he did not think proper to engage, 
<A NAME="1001"></A>lest, after the enemy were routed, it might be said that they had been 
<A NAME="1002"></A>insnared by him under the sanction of a conference. When it was spread 
<A NAME="1003"></A>abroad among the common soldiery with what haughtiness Ariovistus had behaved 
<A NAME="1004"></A>at the conference, and how he had ordered the Romans to quit Gaul, and 
<A NAME="1005"></A>how his cavalry had made an attack upon our men, and how this had broken 
<A NAME="1006"></A>off the conference, a much greater alacrity and eagerness for battle was 
<A NAME="1007"></A>infused into our army.
<A NAME="1008"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 47</B>
<A NAME="1009"></A><BR><BR>Two days after, Ariovistus sends embassadors to Caesar, to state 
<A NAME="1010"></A>"that he wished to treat with him about those things which had been begun 
<A NAME="1011"></A>to be treated of between them, but had not been concluded;" [and to beg] 
<A NAME="1012"></A>that "he would either again appoint a day for a conference; or, if he were 
<A NAME="1013"></A>not willing to do that, that he would send one of his [officers] as an 
<A NAME="1014"></A>embassador to him." There did not appear to Caesar any good reason for 
<A NAME="1015"></A>holding a conference; and the more so as the day before the Germans could 
<A NAME="1016"></A>not be restrained from casting weapons at our men. He thought he should 
<A NAME="1017"></A>not without great danger send to him as embassador one of his [Roman] officers, 
<A NAME="1018"></A>and should expose him to savage men. It seemed [therefore] most proper 
<A NAME="1019"></A>to send to him C. Valerius Procillus, the son of C. Valerius Caburus, a 
<A NAME="1020"></A>young man of the highest courage and accomplishments (whose father had 
<A NAME="1021"></A>been presented with the freedom of the city by C. Valerius Flaccus), both 
<A NAME="1022"></A>on account of his fidelity and on account of his knowledge of the Gallic 
<A NAME="1023"></A>language, which Ariovistus, by long practice, now spoke fluently; and because 
<A NAME="1024"></A>in his case the Germans would have no motive for committing violence; and 
<A NAME="1025"></A>[as his colleague] M. Mettius, who had shared the hospitality of Ariovistus. 
<A NAME="1026"></A>He commissioned them to learn what Ariovistus had to say, and to report 
<A NAME="1027"></A>to him. But when Ariovistus saw them before him in his camp, he cried out 
<A NAME="1028"></A>in the presence of his army, "Why were they come to him? Was it for the 
<A NAME="1029"></A>purpose of acting as spies?" He stopped them when attempting to speak, 
<A NAME="1030"></A>and cast them into chains.
<A NAME="1031"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 48</B>
<A NAME="1032"></A><BR><BR>The same day he moved his camp forward and pitched under a hill 
<A NAME="1033"></A>six miles from Caesar's camp. The day following he led his forces past 
<A NAME="1034"></A>Caesar's camp, and encamped two miles beyond him; with this design that 
<A NAME="1035"></A>he might cut off Caesar from the corn and provisions, which might be conveyed 
<A NAME="1036"></A>to him from the Sequani and the Aedui. For five successive days from that 
<A NAME="1037"></A>day, Caesar drew out his forces before the camp, and put them in battle 
<A NAME="1038"></A>order, that, if Ariovistus should be willing to engage in battle, an opportunity 
<A NAME="1039"></A>might not be wanting to him. Ariovistus all this time kept his army in 
<A NAME="1040"></A>camp: but engaged daily in cavalry skirmishes. The method of battle in 
<A NAME="1041"></A>which the Germans had practiced themselves was this. There were 6,000 horse, 
<A NAME="1042"></A>and as many very active and courageous foot, one of whom each of the horse 
<A NAME="1043"></A>selected out of the whole army for his own protection. By these [foot] 
<A NAME="1044"></A>they were constantly accompanied in their engagements; to these the horse 
<A NAME="1045"></A>retired; these on any emergency rushed forward; if any one, upon receiving 
<A NAME="1046"></A>a very severe wound, had fallen from his horse, they stood around him: 
<A NAME="1047"></A>if it was necessary to advance further than usual, or to retreat more rapidly, 
<A NAME="1048"></A>so great, from practice, was their swiftness, that, supported by the manes 
<A NAME="1049"></A>of the horses, they could keep pace with their speed.
<A NAME="1050"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 49</B>
<A NAME="1051"></A><BR><BR>Perceiving that Ariovistus kept himself in camp, Caesar, that he 
<A NAME="1052"></A>might not any longer be cut off from provisions, chose a convenient position 
<A NAME="1053"></A>for a camp beyond that place in which the Germans had encamped, at about 
<A NAME="1054"></A>600 paces from them, and having drawn up his army in three lines, marched 
<A NAME="1055"></A>to that place. He ordered the first and second lines to be under arms; 
<A NAME="1056"></A>the third to fortify the camp. This place was distant from the enemy about 
<A NAME="1057"></A>600 paces, as has been stated. Thither Ariovistus sent light troops, about 
<A NAME="1058"></A>16,000 men in number, with all his cavalry; which forces were to intimidate 
<A NAME="1059"></A>our men, and hinder them in their fortification. Caesar nevertheless, as 
<A NAME="1060"></A>he had before arranged, ordered two lines to drive off the enemy: the third 
<A NAME="1061"></A>to execute the work. The camp being fortified, he left there two legions 
<A NAME="1062"></A>and a portion of the auxiliaries; and led back the other four legions into 
<A NAME="1063"></A>the larger camp.
<A NAME="1064"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 50</B>
<A NAME="1065"></A><BR><BR>The next day, according to his custom, Caesar led out his forces 
<A NAME="1066"></A>from both camps, and having advanced a little from the larger one, drew 
<A NAME="1067"></A>up his line of battle, and gave the enemy an opportunity of fighting. When 
<A NAME="1068"></A>he found that they did not even then come out [from their intrenchments,] 
<A NAME="1069"></A>he led back his army into camp about noon. Then at last Ariovistus sent 
<A NAME="1070"></A>part of his forces to attack the lesser camp. The battle was vigorously 
<A NAME="1071"></A>maintained on both sides till the evening. At sunset, after many wounds 
<A NAME="1072"></A>had been inflicted and received, Ariovistus led back his forces into camp. 
<A NAME="1073"></A>When Caesar inquired of his prisoners, wherefore Ariovistus did not come 
<A NAME="1074"></A>to an engagement, he discovered this to be the reason - that among the 
<A NAME="1075"></A>Germans it was the custom for their matrons to pronounce from lots and 
<A NAME="1076"></A>divination, whether it were expedient that the battle should be engaged 
<A NAME="1077"></A>in or not; that they had said, "that it was not the will of heaven that 
<A NAME="1078"></A>the Germans should conquer, if they engaged in battle before the new 
<A NAME="1079"></A>moon."
<A NAME="1080"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 51</B>
<A NAME="1081"></A><BR><BR>The day following, Caesar left what seemed sufficient as a guard 
<A NAME="1082"></A>for both camps; [and then] drew up all the auxiliaries in sight of the
