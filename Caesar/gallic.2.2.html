<A NAME="10"></A><B>Chapter 1</B>
<A NAME="11"></A><BR><BR>While Caesar was in winter quarters in Hither Gaul, as we have 
<A NAME="12"></A>shown above, frequent reports were brought to him, and he was also informed 
<A NAME="13"></A>by letters from Labienus, that all the Belgae, who we have said are a third 
<A NAME="14"></A>part of Gaul, were entering into a confederacy against the Roman people, 
<A NAME="15"></A>and giving hostages to one another; that the reasons of the confederacy 
<A NAME="16"></A>were these - first, because they feared that, after all [Celtic] Gaul was 
<A NAME="17"></A>subdued, our army would be led against them; secondly, because they were 
<A NAME="18"></A>instigated by several of the Gauls; some of whom as [on the one hand] they 
<A NAME="19"></A>had been unwilling that the Germans should remain any longer in Gaul, so 
<A NAME="20"></A>[on the other] they were dissatisfied that the army of the Roman people 
<A NAME="21"></A>should pass the winter in it, and settle there; and others of them, from 
<A NAME="22"></A>a natural instability and fickleness of disposition, were anxious for a 
<A NAME="23"></A>revolution; [the Belgae were instigated] by several, also, because the 
<A NAME="24"></A>government in Gaul was generally seized upon by the more powerful persons 
<A NAME="25"></A>and by those who had the means of hiring troops, and they could less easily 
<A NAME="26"></A>effect this object under our dominion.
<A NAME="27"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 2</B>
<A NAME="28"></A><BR><BR>Alarmed by these tidings and letters, Caesar levied two new legions 
<A NAME="29"></A>in Hither Gaul, and, at the beginning of summer, sent Q. Pedius, his lieutenant, 
<A NAME="30"></A>to conduct them further into Gaul. He, himself, as soon as there began 
<A NAME="31"></A>to be plenty of forage, came to the army. He gives a commission to the 
<A NAME="32"></A>Senones and the other Gauls who were neighbors of the Belgae, to learn 
<A NAME="33"></A>what is going on among them [i.e. the Belgae], and inform him of these 
<A NAME="34"></A>matters. These all uniformly reported that troops were being raised, and 
<A NAME="35"></A>that an army was being collected in one place. Then, indeed, he thought 
<A NAME="36"></A>that he ought not to hesitate about proceeding toward them, and having 
<A NAME="37"></A>provided supplies, moves his camp, and in about fifteen days arrives at 
<A NAME="38"></A>the territories of the Belgae.
<A NAME="39"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 3</B>
<A NAME="40"></A><BR><BR>As he arrived there unexpectedly and sooner than any one anticipated, 
<A NAME="41"></A>the Remi, who are the nearest of the Belgae to [Celtic] Gaul, sent to him 
<A NAME="42"></A>Iccius and Antebrogius, [two of] the principal persons of the state, as 
<A NAME="43"></A>their embassadors: to tell him that they surrendered themselves and all 
<A NAME="44"></A>their possessions to the protection and disposal of the Roman people: and 
<A NAME="45"></A>that they had neither combined with the rest of the Belgae, nor entered 
<A NAME="46"></A>into any confederacy against the Roman people: and were prepared to give 
<A NAME="47"></A>hostages, to obey his commands, to receive him into their towns, and to 
<A NAME="48"></A>aid him with corn and other things; that all the rest of the Belgae were 
<A NAME="49"></A>in arms; and that the Germans, who dwell on this side of the Rhine, had 
<A NAME="50"></A>joined themselves to them; and that so great was the infatuation of them 
<A NAME="51"></A>all, that they could not restrain even the Suessiones, their own brethren 
<A NAME="52"></A>and kinsmen, who enjoy the same rights, and the, same laws, and who have 
<A NAME="53"></A>one government and one magistracy [in common] with themselves, from uniting 
<A NAME="54"></A>with them.
<A NAME="55"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 4</B>
<A NAME="56"></A><BR><BR>When Caesar inquired of them what states were in arms, how powerful 
<A NAME="57"></A>they were, and what they could do, in war, he received the following information: 
<A NAME="58"></A>that the greater part of the Belgae were sprung, from the Germans, and 
<A NAME="59"></A>that having crossed the Rhine at an early period, they had settled there, 
<A NAME="60"></A>on account of the fertility of the country, and had driven out the Gauls 
<A NAME="61"></A>who inhabited those regions; and that they were the only people who, in 
<A NAME="62"></A>the memory of our fathers, when all Gaul was overrun, had prevented the 
<A NAME="63"></A>Teutones and the Cimbri from entering their territories; the effect of 
<A NAME="64"></A>which was, that, from the recollection of those events, they assumed to 
<A NAME="65"></A>themselves great authority and haughtiness in military matters. The Remi 
<A NAME="66"></A>said, that they had known accurately every thing respecting their number, 
<A NAME="67"></A>because being united to them by neighborhood and by alliances, they had 
<A NAME="68"></A>learned what number each state had in the general council of the Belgae 
<A NAME="69"></A>promised for that war. That the Bellovaci were the most powerful among 
<A NAME="70"></A>them in valor, influence, and the number of men; that these could muster 
<A NAME="71"></A>100,000 armed men, [and had] promised 60,000 picked men out of that number, 
<A NAME="72"></A>and demanded for themselves the command of the whole war. That the Suessiones 
<A NAME="73"></A>were their nearest neighbors and possessed a very extensive and fertile 
<A NAME="74"></A>country; that among them, even in our own memory, Divitiacus, the most 
<A NAME="75"></A>powerful man of all Gaul, had been king; who had held the government of 
<A NAME="76"></A>a great part of these regions, as well as of Britain; that their king at 
<A NAME="77"></A>present was Galba; that the direction of the whole war was conferred by 
<A NAME="78"></A>the consent of all, upon him, on account of his integrity and prudence; 
<A NAME="79"></A>that they had twelve towns; that they had promised 50,000 armed men; and 
<A NAME="80"></A>that the Nervii, who are reckoned the most warlike among them, and are 
<A NAME="81"></A>situated at a very great distance, [had promised] as many; the Atrebates 
<A NAME="82"></A>15,000; the Ambiani, 10,000; the Morini, 25,000; the Menapii, 9,000; the 
<A NAME="83"></A>Caleti, 10,000; the Velocasses and the Veromandui as many; the Aduatuci 
<A NAME="84"></A>19,000; that the Condrusi, the Eburones, the Caeraesi, the Paemani, who 
<A NAME="85"></A>are called by the common name of Germans [had promised], they thought, 
<A NAME="86"></A>to the number of 40,000.
<A NAME="87"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 5</B>
<A NAME="88"></A><BR><BR>Caesar, having encouraged the Remi, and addressed them courteously, 
<A NAME="89"></A>ordered the whole senate to assemble before him, and the children of their 
<A NAME="90"></A>chief men to be brought to him as hostages; all which commands they punctually 
<A NAME="91"></A>performed by the day [appointed]. He, addressing himself to Divitiacus, 
<A NAME="92"></A>the Aeduan, with great earnestness, points out how much it concerns the 
<A NAME="93"></A>republic and their common security, that the forces of the enemy should 
<A NAME="94"></A>be divided, so that it might not be necessary to engage with so large a 
<A NAME="95"></A>number at one time. [He asserts] that this might be affected if the Aedui 
<A NAME="96"></A>would lead their forces into the territories of the Bellovaci, and begin 
<A NAME="97"></A>to lay waste their country. With these instructions he dismissed him from 
<A NAME="98"></A>his presence. After he perceived that all the forces of the Belgae, which 
<A NAME="99"></A>had been collected in one place, were approaching toward him, and learned 
<A NAME="100"></A>from the scouts whom he had sent out, and [also] from the Remi, that they 
<A NAME="101"></A>were then not far distant, he hastened to lead his army over the Aisne, 
<A NAME="102"></A>which is on the borders of the Remi, and there pitched his camp. This position 
<A NAME="103"></A>fortified one side of his camp by the banks of the river, rendered the 
<A NAME="104"></A>country which lay in his rear secure from the enemy, and furthermore insured 
<A NAME="105"></A>that provisions might without danger be brought to him by the Remi and 
<A NAME="106"></A>the rest of the states. Over that river was a bridge: there he places a 
<A NAME="107"></A>guard; and on the other side of the river he leaves Q. Titurius Sabinus, 
<A NAME="108"></A>his lieutenant, with six cohorts. He orders him to fortify a camp with 
<A NAME="109"></A>a rampart twelve feet in height, and a trench eighteen feet in 
<A NAME="110"></A>breadth.
<A NAME="111"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 6</B>
<A NAME="112"></A><BR><BR>There was a town of the Remi, by name Bibrax, eight miles distant 
<A NAME="113"></A>from this camp. This the Belgae on their march began to attack with great 
<A NAME="114"></A>vigor. [The assault] was with difficulty sustained for that day. The Gauls' 
<A NAME="115"></A>mode of besieging is the same as that of the Belgae: when after having 
<A NAME="116"></A>drawn a large number of men around the whole of the fortifications, stones 
<A NAME="117"></A>have begun to be cast against the wall on all sides, and the wall has been 
<A NAME="118"></A>stripped of its defenders, [then], forming a testudo, they advance to the 
<A NAME="119"></A>gates and undermine the wall: which was easily effected on this occasion; 
<A NAME="120"></A>for while so large a number were casting stones and darts, no one was able 
<A NAME="121"></A>to maintain his position upon the wall. When night had put an end to the 
<A NAME="122"></A>assault, Iccius, who was then in command of the town, one of the Remi, 
<A NAME="123"></A>a man of the highest rank and influence among his people, and one of those 
<A NAME="124"></A>who had come to Caesar as embassador [to sue] for peace, sends messengers 
<A NAME="125"></A>to him, [to report] "That, unless assistance were sent to him he could 
<A NAME="126"></A>not hold out any longer."
<A NAME="127"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 7</B>
<A NAME="128"></A><BR><BR>Thither, immediately after midnight, Caesar, using as guides the 
<A NAME="129"></A>same persons who had come to him as messengers from Iccius, sends some 
<A NAME="130"></A>Numidian and Cretan archers, and some Balearian slingers as a relief to 
<A NAME="131"></A>the towns-people, by whose arrival both a desire to resist together with 
<A NAME="132"></A>the hope of [making good their] defense, was infused into the Remi, and, 
<A NAME="133"></A>for the same reason, the hope of gaining the town, abandoned the enemy. 
<A NAME="134"></A>Therefore, after staying a short time before the town, and laying waste 
<A NAME="135"></A>the country of the Remi, when all the villages and buildings which they 
<A NAME="136"></A>could approach had been burned, they hastened with all their forces to 
<A NAME="137"></A>the camp of Caesar, and encamped within less than two miles [of it]; and 
<A NAME="138"></A>their camp, as was indicated by the smoke and fires, extended more than 
<A NAME="139"></A>eight miles in breadth.
<A NAME="140"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 8</B>
<A NAME="141"></A><BR><BR>Caesar at first determined to decline a battle, as well on account 
<A NAME="142"></A>of the great number of the enemy as their distinguished reputation for 
<A NAME="143"></A>valor: daily, however, in cavalry actions, he strove to ascertain by frequent 
<A NAME="144"></A>trials, what the enemy could effect by their prowess and what our men would 
<A NAME="145"></A>dare. When he perceived that our men were not inferior, as the place before 
<A NAME="146"></A>the camp was naturally convenient and suitable for marshaling an army (since 
<A NAME="147"></A>the hill where the camp was pitched, rising gradually from the plain, extended 
<A NAME="148"></A>forward in breadth as far as the space which the marshaled army could occupy, 
<A NAME="149"></A>and had steep declines of its side in either direction, and gently sloping 
<A NAME="150"></A>in front gradually sank to the plain); on either side of that hill he drew 
<A NAME="151"></A>a cross trench of about four hundred paces, and at the extremities of that 
<A NAME="152"></A>trench built forts, and placed there his military engines, lest, after 
<A NAME="153"></A>he had marshaled his army, the enemy, since they were so powerful in point 
<A NAME="154"></A>of number, should be able to surround his men in the flank, while fighting. 
<A NAME="155"></A>After doing this, and leaving in the camp the two legions which he had 
<A NAME="156"></A>last raised, that, if there should be any occasion, they might be brought 
<A NAME="157"></A>as a reserve, he formed the other six legions in order of battle before 
<A NAME="158"></A>the camp. The enemy, likewise, had drawn up their forces which they had 
<A NAME="159"></A>brought out of the camp.
<A NAME="160"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 9</B>
<A NAME="161"></A><BR><BR>There was a marsh of no great extent between our army and that 
<A NAME="162"></A>of the enemy. The latter were waiting to see if our men would pass this; 
<A NAME="163"></A>our men, also, were ready in arms to attack them while disordered, if the 
<A NAME="164"></A>first attempt to pass should be made by them. In the mean time battle was 
<A NAME="165"></A>commenced between the two armies by a cavalry action. When neither army 
<A NAME="166"></A>began to pass the marsh, Caesar, upon the skirmishes of the horse [proving] 
<A NAME="167"></A>favorable to our men, led back his forces into the camp. The enemy immediately 
<A NAME="168"></A>hastened from that place to the river Aisne, which it has been; stated 
<A NAME="169"></A>was behind our camp. Finding a ford there, they endeavored to lead a part 
<A NAME="170"></A>of their forces over it; with the design, that, if they could, they might 
<A NAME="171"></A>carry by storm the fort which Q. Titurius, Caesar's lieutenant, commanded, 
<A NAME="172"></A>and might cut off the bridge; but, if they could not do that, they should 
<A NAME="173"></A>lay waste the lands of the Remi, which were of great use to us in carrying 
<A NAME="174"></A>on the war, and might hinder our men from foraging.
<A NAME="175"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 10</B>
<A NAME="176"></A><BR><BR>Caesar, being apprized of this by Titurius, leads all his cavalry 
<A NAME="177"></A>and light-armed Numidians, slingers and archers, over the bridge, and hastens 
<A NAME="178"></A>toward them. There was a severe struggle in that place. Our men, attacking 
<A NAME="179"></A>in the river the disordered enemy, slew a great part of them. By the immense 
<A NAME="180"></A>number of their missiles they drove back the rest, who, in a most courageous 
<A NAME="181"></A>manner were attempting to pass over their bodies, and surrounded with their 
<A NAME="182"></A>cavalry, and cut to pieces those who had first crossed the river. The enemy, 
<A NAME="183"></A>when they perceived that their hopes had deceived them both with regard 
<A NAME="184"></A>to their taking the town by storm and also their passing the river, and 
<A NAME="185"></A>did not see our men advance to a more disadvantageous place for the purpose 
<A NAME="186"></A>of fighting, and when provisions began to fail them, having called a council, 
<A NAME="187"></A>determined that it was best for each to return to his country, and resolved 
<A NAME="188"></A>to assemble from all quarters to defend those into whose territories the 
<A NAME="189"></A>Romans should first march an army; that they might contend in their own 
<A NAME="190"></A>rather than in a foreign country, and might enjoy the stores of provision 
<A NAME="191"></A>which they possessed at home. Together with other causes, this consideration 
<A NAME="192"></A>also led them to that resolution, viz: that they had learned that Divitiacus 
<A NAME="193"></A>and the Aedui were approaching the territories of the Bellovaci. And it 
<A NAME="194"></A>was impossible to persuade the latter to stay any longer, or to deter them 
<A NAME="195"></A>from conveying succor to their own people.
<A NAME="196"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 11</B>
<A NAME="197"></A><BR><BR>That matter being determined on, marching out of their camp at 
<A NAME="198"></A>the second watch, with great noise and confusion, in no fixed order, nor 
<A NAME="199"></A>under any command, since each sought for himself the foremost place in 
<A NAME="200"></A>the journey, and hastened to reach home, they made their departure appear 
<A NAME="201"></A>very like a flight. Caesar, immediately learning this through his scouts, 
<A NAME="202"></A>[but] fearing an ambuscade, because he had not yet discovered for what 
<A NAME="203"></A>reason they were departing, kept his army and cavalry within the camp. 
<A NAME="204"></A>At daybreak, the intelligence having been confirmed by the scouts, he sent 
<A NAME="205"></A>forward his cavalry to harass their rear; and gave the command of it to 
<A NAME="206"></A>two of his lieutenants, Q. Pedius, and L. Aurunculeius Cotta. He ordered 
<A NAME="207"></A>T. Labienus, another of his lieutenants, to follow them closely with three 
<A NAME="208"></A>legions. These, attacking their rear, and pursuing them for many miles, 
<A NAME="209"></A>slew a great number of them as they were fleeing; while those in the rear 
<A NAME="210"></A>with whom they had come up, halted, and bravely sustained the attack of 
<A NAME="211"></A>our soldiers; the van, because they appeared to be removed from danger, 
<A NAME="212"></A>and were not restrained by any necessity or command, as soon as the noise 
<A NAME="213"></A>was heard, broke their ranks, and, to a man, rested their safety in flight. 
<A NAME="214"></A>Thus without any risk [to themselves] our men killed as great a number 
<A NAME="215"></A>of them as the length of the day allowed; and at sunset desisted from the 
<A NAME="216"></A>pursuit, and betook themselves into the camp, as they had been 
<A NAME="217"></A>commanded.
<A NAME="218"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 12</B>
<A NAME="219"></A><BR><BR>On the day following, before the enemy could recover from their 
<A NAME="220"></A>terror and flight, Caesar led his army into the territories of the Suessiones, 
<A NAME="221"></A>which are next to the Remi, and having accomplished a long march, hastens 
<A NAME="222"></A>to the town named Noviodunum. Having attempted to take it by storm on his 
<A NAME="223"></A>march, because he heard that it was destitute of [sufficient] defenders, 
<A NAME="224"></A>he was not able to carry it by assault, on account of the breadth of the 
<A NAME="225"></A>ditch and the height of the wall, though few were defending it. Therefore, 
<A NAME="226"></A>having fortified the camp, he began to bring up the vineae, and to provide 
<A NAME="227"></A>whatever things were necessary for the storm. In the mean time the whole 
<A NAME="228"></A>body of the Suessiones, after their flight, came the next night into the 
<A NAME="229"></A>town. The vineae having been quickly brought up against the town, a mound 
<A NAME="230"></A>thrown up, and towers built, the Gauls, amazed by the greatness of the 
<A NAME="231"></A>works, such as they had neither seen nor heard of before, and struck also 
<A NAME="232"></A>by the dispatch of the Romans, send embassadors to Caesar respecting a 
<A NAME="233"></A>surrender, and succeed in consequence of the Remi requesting that they 
<A NAME="234"></A>[the Suessiones] might be spared.
<A NAME="235"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 13</B>
<A NAME="236"></A><BR><BR>Caesar, having received as hostages the first men of the state, 
<A NAME="237"></A>and even the two sons of king Galba himself; and all the arms in the town 
<A NAME="238"></A>having been delivered up, admitted the Suessiones to a surrender, and led 
<A NAME="239"></A>his army against the Bellovaci. Who, when they had conveyed themselves 
<A NAME="240"></A>and all their possessions into the town Galled Bratuspantium, and Caesar 
<A NAME="241"></A>with his army was about five miles distant from that town, all the old 
<A NAME="242"></A>men, going out of the town, began to stretch out their hands to Caesar, 
<A NAME="243"></A>and to intimate by their voice that they would throw themselves on his 
<A NAME="244"></A>protection and power, nor would contend in arms against the Roman people. 
<A NAME="245"></A>In like manner, when he had come up to the town, and there pitched his 
<A NAME="246"></A>camp, the boys and the women from the wall, with outstretched hands, after 
<A NAME="247"></A>their custom, begged peace from the Romans.
<A NAME="248"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 14</B>
<A NAME="249"></A><BR><BR>For these Divitiacus pleads (for after the departure of the Belgae, 
<A NAME="250"></A>having dismissed the troops of the Aedui, he had returned to Caesar). "The 
<A NAME="251"></A>Bellovaci had at all times been in the alliance and friendship of the Aeduan 
<A NAME="252"></A>state; that they had revolted from the Aedui and made war upon the Roman 
<A NAME="253"></A>people, being urged thereto by their nobles, who said that the Aedui, reduced 
<A NAME="254"></A>to slavery by Caesar, were suffering every indignity and insult. That they 
<A NAME="255"></A>who had been the leaders of that plot, because they perceived how great 
<A NAME="256"></A>a calamity they had brought upon the state, had fled into Britain. That 
<A NAME="257"></A>not only the Bellovaci, but also the Aedui, entreated him to use his [accustomed] 
<A NAME="258"></A>clemency and lenity toward them [the Bellovaci]: which if he did, he would 
<A NAME="259"></A>increase the influence of the Aedui among all the Belgae, by whose succor 
<A NAME="260"></A>and resources they had been accustomed to support themselves whenever any 
<A NAME="261"></A>wars occurred."
<A NAME="262"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 15</B>
<A NAME="263"></A><BR><BR>Caesar said that on account of his respect for Divitiacus and the 
<A NAME="264"></A>Aeduans, he would receive them into his protection, and would spare them; 
<A NAME="265"></A>but, because the state was of great influence among the Belgae, and pre-eminent 
<A NAME="266"></A>in the number of its population, he demanded 600 hostages. When these were 
<A NAME="267"></A>delivered, and all the arms in the town collected, he went from that place 
<A NAME="268"></A>into the territories of the Ambiani, who, without delay, surrendered themselves 
<A NAME="269"></A>and all their possessions. Upon their territories bordered the Nervii, 
<A NAME="270"></A>concerning whose character and customs when Caesar inquired he received 
<A NAME="271"></A>the following information: - That there was no access for merchants to 
<A NAME="272"></A>them; that they suffered no wine and other things tending to luxury to 
<A NAME="273"></A>be imported; because, they thought that by their use the mind is enervated 
<A NAME="274"></A>and the courage impaired: that they were a savage people and of great bravery: 
<A NAME="275"></A>that they upbraided and condemned the rest of the Belgae who had surrendered 
<A NAME="276"></A>themselves to the Roman people and thrown aside their national courage: 
<A NAME="277"></A>that they openly declared they would neither send embassadors, nor accept 
<A NAME="278"></A>any condition of peace."
<A NAME="279"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 16</B>
<A NAME="280"></A><BR><BR>After he had made three days march through their territories, he 
<A NAME="281"></A>discovered from some prisoners, that the river Sambre was not more than 
<A NAME="282"></A>ten miles from his camp; that all the Nervii had stationed themselves on 
<A NAME="283"></A>the other side of that river, and together with the Atrebates and the Veromandui, 
<A NAME="284"></A>their neighbors, were there awaiting the arrival of the Romans; for they 
<A NAME="285"></A>had persuaded both these nations to try the same fortune of war [as themselves]: 
<A NAME="286"></A>that the forces of the Aduatuci were also expected by them, and were on 
<A NAME="287"></A>their march; that they had put their women, and those who through age appeared 
<A NAME="288"></A>useless for war, in a place to which there was no approach for an army, 
<A NAME="289"></A>on account of the marshes.
<A NAME="290"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 17</B>
<A NAME="291"></A><BR><BR>Having learned these things, he sends forward scouts and centurions 
<A NAME="292"></A>to choose a convenient place for the camp. And as a great many of the surrounding 
<A NAME="293"></A>Belgae and other Gauls, following Caesar, marched with him; some of these, 
<A NAME="294"></A>as was afterwards learned from the prisoners, having accurately observed, 
<A NAME="295"></A>during those days, the army's method of marching, went by night to the 
<A NAME="296"></A>Nervii, and informed them that a great number of baggage-trains passed 
<A NAME="297"></A>between the several legions, and that there would be no difficulty, when 
<A NAME="298"></A>the first legion had come into the camp, and the other legions were at 
<A NAME="299"></A>a great distance, to attack that legion while under baggage, which being 
<A NAME="300"></A>routed, and the baggage-train seized, it would come to pass that the other 
<A NAME="301"></A>legions would not dare to stand their ground. It added weight also to the 
<A NAME="302"></A>advice of those who reported that circumstance, that the Nervii, from early 
<A NAME="303"></A>times, because they were weak in cavalry, (for not even at this time do 
<A NAME="304"></A>they attend to it, but accomplish by their infantry whatever they can,) 
<A NAME="305"></A>in order that they might the more easily obstruct the cavalry of their 
<A NAME="306"></A>neighbors if they came upon them for the purpose of plundering, having 
<A NAME="307"></A>cut young trees, and bent them, by means of their numerous branches [extending] 
<A NAME="308"></A>on to the sides, and the quick-briars and thorns springing up between them, 
<A NAME="309"></A>had made these hedges present a fortification like a wall, through which 
<A NAME="310"></A>it was not only impossible to enter, but even to penetrate with the eye. 
<A NAME="311"></A>Since [therefore] the march of our army would be obstructed by these things, 
<A NAME="312"></A>the Nervii thought that the advice ought not to be neglected by 
<A NAME="313"></A>them.
<A NAME="314"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 18</B>
<A NAME="315"></A><BR><BR>The nature of the ground which our men had chosen for the camp 
<A NAME="316"></A>was this: A hill, declining evenly from the top, extending to the river 
<A NAME="317"></A>Sambre, which we have mentioned above: from this river there arose a [second] 
<A NAME="318"></A>hill of like ascent, on the other side and opposite to the former, and 
<A NAME="319"></A>open for about 200 paces at the lower part; but in the upper part, woody, 
<A NAME="320"></A>(so much so) that it was not easy to see through it into the interior. 
<A NAME="321"></A>Within these woods the enemy kept themselves in concealment; a few troops 
<A NAME="322"></A>of horse-soldiers appeared on the open ground, along the river. The depth 
<A NAME="323"></A>of the river was about three feet.
<A NAME="324"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 19</B>
<A NAME="325"></A><BR><BR>Caesar, having sent his cavalry on before, followed close after 
<A NAME="326"></A>them with all his forces; but the plan and order of the march was different 
<A NAME="327"></A>from that which the Belgae had reported to the Nervii. For as he was approaching 
<A NAME="328"></A>the enemy, Caesar, according to his custom, led on [as the van six legions 
<A NAME="329"></A>unencumbered by baggage; behind them he had placed the baggage- trains 
<A NAME="330"></A>of the whole army; then the two legions which had been last raised closed 
<A NAME="331"></A>the rear, and were a guard for the baggage-train. Our horse, with the slingers 
<A NAME="332"></A>and archers, having passed the river, commenced action with the cavalry 
<A NAME="333"></A>of the enemy. While they from time to time betook themselves into the woods 
<A NAME="334"></A>to their companions, and again made an assault out of the wood upon our 
<A NAME="335"></A>men, who did not dare to follow them in their retreat further than the 
<A NAME="336"></A>limit to which the plain and open parts extended, in the mean time the 
<A NAME="337"></A>six legions which had arrived first, having measured out the work, began 
<A NAME="338"></A>to fortify the camp. When the first part of the baggage train of our army 
<A NAME="339"></A>was seen by those who lay hid in the woods, which had been agreed on among 
<A NAME="340"></A>them as the time for commencing action, as soon as they had arranged their 
<A NAME="341"></A>line of battle and formed their ranks within the woods, and had encouraged 
<A NAME="342"></A>one another, they rushed out suddenly with all their forces and made an 
<A NAME="343"></A>attack upon our horse. The latter being easily routed and thrown into confusion, 
<A NAME="344"></A>the Nervii ran down to the river with such incredible speed that they seemed 
<A NAME="345"></A>to be in the woods, the river, and close upon us almost at the same time. 
<A NAME="346"></A>And with the same speed they hastened up the hill to our camp, and to those 
<A NAME="347"></A>who were employed in the works.
<A NAME="348"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 20</B>
<A NAME="349"></A><BR><BR>Caesar had every thing to do at one time: the standard to be displayed, 
<A NAME="350"></A>which was the sign when it was necessary to run to arms; the signal to 
<A NAME="351"></A>be given by the trumpet; the soldiers to be called off from the works; 
<A NAME="352"></A>those who had proceeded some distance for the purpose of seeking materials 
<A NAME="353"></A>for the rampart, to be summoned; the order of battle to be formed; the 
<A NAME="354"></A>soldiers to be encouraged; the watchword to be given. A great part of these 
<A NAME="355"></A>arrangements was prevented by the shortness of time and the sudden approach 
<A NAME="356"></A>and charge of the enemy. Under these difficulties two things proved of 
<A NAME="357"></A>advantage; [first] the skill and experience of the soldiers, because, having 
<A NAME="358"></A>been trained by former engagements, they could suggest to themselves what 
<A NAME="359"></A>ought to be done, as conveniently as receive information from others; and 
<A NAME="360"></A>[secondly] that Caesar had forbidden his several lieutenants to depart 
<A NAME="361"></A>from the works and their respective legions, before the camp was fortified. 
<A NAME="362"></A>These, on account of the near approach and the speed of the enemy, did 
<A NAME="363"></A>not then wait for any command from Caesar, but of themselves executed whatever 
<A NAME="364"></A>appeared proper.
<A NAME="365"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 21</B>
<A NAME="366"></A><BR><BR>Caesar, having given the necessary orders, hastened to and fro 
<A NAME="367"></A>into whatever quarter fortune carried him, to animate the troops, and came 
<A NAME="368"></A>to the tenth legion. Having encouraged the soldiers with no further speech 
<A NAME="369"></A>than that "they should keep up the remembrance of their wonted valor, and 
<A NAME="370"></A>not be confused in mind, but valiantly sustain the assault of the enemy 
<A NAME="371"></A>;" as the latter were not further from them than the distance to which 
<A NAME="372"></A>a dart could be cast, he gave the signal for commencing battle. And having 
<A NAME="373"></A>gone to another quarter for the purpose of encouraging [the soldiers], 
<A NAME="374"></A>he finds them fighting. Such was the shortness of the time, and so determined 
<A NAME="375"></A>was the mind of the enemy on fighting, that time was wanting not only for 
<A NAME="376"></A>affixing the military insignia, but even for putting on the helmets and 
<A NAME="377"></A>drawing off the covers from the shields. To whatever part any one by chance 
<A NAME="378"></A>came from the works (in which he had been employed), and whatever standards 
<A NAME="379"></A>he saw first, at these he stood, lest in seeking his own company he should 
<A NAME="380"></A>lose the time for fighting.
<A NAME="381"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 22</B>
<A NAME="382"></A><BR><BR>The army having been marshaled, rather as the nature of the ground 
<A NAME="383"></A>and the declivity of the hill and the exigency of the time, than as the 
<A NAME="384"></A>method and order of military matters required; while the legions in the 
<A NAME="385"></A>different places were withstanding the enemy, some in one quarter, some 
<A NAME="386"></A>in another, and the view was obstructed by the very thick hedges intervening, 
<A NAME="387"></A>as we have before remarked, neither could proper reserves be posted, nor 
<A NAME="388"></A>could the necessary measures be taken in each part, nor could all the commands 
<A NAME="389"></A>be issued by one person. Therefore, in such an unfavorable state of affairs, 
<A NAME="390"></A>various events of fortune followed.
<A NAME="391"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 23</B>
<A NAME="392"></A><BR><BR>The soldiers of the ninth and tenth legions, as they had been stationed 
<A NAME="393"></A>on the left part of the army, casting their weapons, speedily drove the 
<A NAME="394"></A>Atrebates (for that division had been opposed to them,) who were breathless 
<A NAME="395"></A>with running and fatigue, and worn out with wounds, from the higher ground 
<A NAME="396"></A>into the river; and following them as they were endeavoring to pass it, 
<A NAME="397"></A>slew with their swords a great part of them while impeded (therein). They 
<A NAME="398"></A>themselves did not hesitate to pass the river; and having advanced to a 
<A NAME="399"></A>disadvantageous place, when the battle was renewed, they [nevertheless] 
<A NAME="400"></A>again put to flight the enemy, who had returned and were opposing them. 
<A NAME="401"></A>In like manner, in another quarter two different legions, the eleventh 
<A NAME="402"></A>and the eighth, having routed the Veromandui, with whom they had engaged, 
<A NAME="403"></A>were fighting from the higher ground upon the very banks of the river. 
<A NAME="404"></A>But, almost the whole camp on the front and on the left side being then 
<A NAME="405"></A>exposed, since the twelfth legion was posted in the right wing, and the 
<A NAME="406"></A>seventh at no great distance from it, all the Nervii, in a very close body, 
<A NAME="407"></A>with Boduognatus, who held the chief command, as their leader, hastened 
<A NAME="408"></A>toward that place; and part of them began to surround the legions on their 
<A NAME="409"></A>unprotected flank, part to make for the highest point of the 
<A NAME="410"></A>encampment.
<A NAME="411"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 24</B>
<A NAME="412"></A><BR><BR>At the same time our horsemen, and light-armed infantry, who had 
<A NAME="413"></A>been with those, who, as I have related, were routed by the first assault 
<A NAME="414"></A>of the enemy, as they were betaking themselves into the camp, met the enemy 
<A NAME="415"></A>face to face, and again sought flight into another quarter; and the camp-followers 
<A NAME="416"></A>who from the Decuman Gate, and from the highest ridge of the hill had seen 
<A NAME="417"></A>our men pass the river as victors, when, after going out for the purposes 
<A NAME="418"></A>of plundering, they looked back and saw the enemy parading in our camp, 
<A NAME="419"></A>committed themselves precipitately to flight; at the same time there arose 
<A NAME="420"></A>the cry and shout of those who came with the baggage-train: and they (affrighted), 
<A NAME="421"></A>were carried some one way, some another. By all these circumstances the 
<A NAME="422"></A>cavalry of the Treviri were much alarmed, (whose reputation for courage 
<A NAME="423"></A>is extraordinary among the Gauls, and who had come to Caesar, being sent 
<A NAME="424"></A>by their state as auxiliaries), and, when they saw our camp filled with 
<A NAME="425"></A>a large number of the enemy, the legions hard pressed and almost held surrounded, 
<A NAME="426"></A>the camp-retainers, horsemen, slingers, and Numidians fleeing on all sides 
<A NAME="427"></A>divided and scattered, they, despairing of our affairs, hastened home, 
<A NAME="428"></A>and related to their state that the Romans were routed and conquered, [and] 
<A NAME="429"></A>that the enemy were in possession of their camp and 
<A NAME="430"></A>baggage-train.
<A NAME="431"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 25</B>
<A NAME="432"></A><BR><BR>Caesar proceeded, after encouraging the tenth legion, to the right 
<A NAME="433"></A>wing; where he perceived that his men were hard pressed, and that in consequence 
<A NAME="434"></A>of the standards of the twelfth legion being collected together in one 
<A NAME="435"></A>place, the crowded soldiers were a hinderance to themselves in the fight; 
<A NAME="436"></A>that all the centurions of the fourth cohort were slain, and the standard- 
<A NAME="437"></A>bearer killed, the standard itself lost, almost all the centurions of the 
<A NAME="438"></A>other cohorts either wounded or slain, and among them the chief centurion 
<A NAME="439"></A>of the legion P. Sextius Baculus, a very valiant man, who was so exhausted 
<A NAME="440"></A>by many and severe wounds, that he was already unable to support himself; 
<A NAME="441"></A>he likewise perceived that the rest were slackening their efforts, and 
<A NAME="442"></A>that some, deserted by those in the rear, were retiring from the battle 
<A NAME="443"></A>and avoiding the weapons; that the enemy [on the other hand] though advancing 
<A NAME="444"></A>from the lower ground, were not relaxing in front, and were [at the same 
<A NAME="445"></A>time] pressing hard on both flanks; he also perceived that the affair was 
<A NAME="446"></A>at a crisis, and that there was not any reserve which could be brought 
<A NAME="447"></A>up, having therefore snatched a shield from one of the soldiers in the 
<A NAME="448"></A>rear (for he himself had come without a shield), he advanced to the front 
<A NAME="449"></A>of the line, and addressing the centurions by name, and encouraging the 
<A NAME="450"></A>rest of the soldiers, he ordered them to carry forward the standards, and 
<A NAME="451"></A>extend the companies, that they might the more easily use their swords. 
<A NAME="452"></A>On his arrival, as hope was brought to the soldiers and their courage restored, 
<A NAME="453"></A>while every one for his own part, in the sight of his general, desired 
<A NAME="454"></A>to exert his utmost energy, the impetuosity of the enemy was a little 
<A NAME="455"></A>checked.
<A NAME="456"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 26</B>
<A NAME="457"></A><BR><BR>Caesar, when he perceived that the seventh legion, which stood 
<A NAME="458"></A>close by him, was also hard pressed by the enemy, directed the tribunes 
<A NAME="459"></A>of the soldiers to effect a junction of the legions gradually, and make 
<A NAME="460"></A>their charge upon the enemy with a double front; which having been done, 
<A NAME="461"></A>since they brought assistance the one to the other, nor feared lest their 
<A NAME="462"></A>rear should be surrounded by the enemy, they began to stand their ground 
<A NAME="463"></A>more boldly, and to fight more courageously. In the mean time, the soldiers 
<A NAME="464"></A>of the two legions which had been in the rear of the army, as a guard for 
<A NAME="465"></A>the baggage-train, upon the battle being reported to them, quickened their 
<A NAME="466"></A>pace, and were seen by the enemy on the top of the hill; and Titus Labienus, 
<A NAME="467"></A>having gained possession of the camp of the enemy, and observed from the 
<A NAME="468"></A>higher ground what was going on in our camp, sent the tenth legion as a 
<A NAME="469"></A>relief to our men, who, when they had learned from the flight of the horse 
<A NAME="470"></A>and the sutlers in what position the affair was, and in how great danger 
<A NAME="471"></A>the camp and the legion and the commander were involved, left undone nothing 
<A NAME="472"></A>[which tended] to dispatch.
<A NAME="473"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 27</B>
<A NAME="474"></A><BR><BR>By their arrival, so great a change of matters was made, that our 
<A NAME="475"></A>men, even those who had fallen down exhausted with wounds, leaned on their 
<A NAME="476"></A>shields, and renewed the fight: then the camp-retainers, though unarmed, 
<A NAME="477"></A>seeing the enemy completely dismayed, attacked [them though] armed; the 
<A NAME="478"></A>horsemen too, that they might by their valor blot the disgrace of their 
<A NAME="479"></A>flight, thrust themselves before the legionary soldiers in all parts of 
<A NAME="480"></A>the battle. But the enemy, even in the last hope of safety, displayed such 
<A NAME="481"></A>great courage, that when the foremost of them had fallen, the next stood 
<A NAME="482"></A>upon them prostrate, and fought from their bodies; when these were overthrown, 
<A NAME="483"></A>and their corpses heaped up together, those who survived cast their weapons 
<A NAME="484"></A>against our men [thence], as from a mound, and returned our darts which 
<A NAME="485"></A>had fallen short between [the armies]; so that it ought not to be concluded, 
<A NAME="486"></A>that men of such great courage had injudiciously dared to pass a very broad 
<A NAME="487"></A>river, ascend very high banks, and come up to a very disadvantageous place; 
<A NAME="488"></A>since their greatness of spirit had rendered these actions easy, although 
<A NAME="489"></A>in themselves very difficult.
<A NAME="490"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 28</B>
<A NAME="491"></A><BR><BR>This battle being ended, and the nation and name of the Nervii 
<A NAME="492"></A>being almost reduced to annihilation, their old men, whom together with 
<A NAME="493"></A>the boys and women we have stated to have been collected together in the 
<A NAME="494"></A>fenny places and marshes, on this battle having been reported to them, 
<A NAME="495"></A>since they were convinced that nothing was an obstacle to the conquerors, 
<A NAME="496"></A>and nothing safe to the conquered, sent embassadors to Caesar by the consent 
<A NAME="497"></A>of all who remained, and surrendered themselves to him; and in recounting 
<A NAME="498"></A>the calamity of their state, said that their senators were reduced from 
<A NAME="499"></A>600 to three; that from 60,000 men they [were reduced] to scarcely 500 
<A NAME="500"></A>who could bear arms; whom Caesar, that he might appear to use compassion 
<A NAME="501"></A>toward the wretched and the suppliant, most carefully spared; and ordered 
<A NAME="502"></A>them to enjoy their own territories and towns, and commanded their neighbors 
<A NAME="503"></A>that they should restrain themselves and their dependents from offering 
<A NAME="504"></A>injury or outrage [to them].
<A NAME="505"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 29</B>
<A NAME="506"></A><BR><BR>When the Aduatuci, of whom we have written above, were coming up 
<A NAME="507"></A>with all their forces to the assistance of the Nervii, upon this battle 
<A NAME="508"></A>being reported to them, they returned home after they were on the march; 
<A NAME="509"></A>deserting all their towns and forts, they conveyed together all their possessions 
<A NAME="510"></A>into one town, eminently fortified by nature. While this town had on all 
<A NAME="511"></A>sides around it very high rocks and precipices, there was left on one side 
<A NAME="512"></A>a gently ascending approach, of not more than 200 feet in width; which 
<A NAME="513"></A>place they had fortified with a very lofty double wall: besides, they had 
<A NAME="514"></A>placed stones of great weight and sharpened stakes upon the walls. They 
<A NAME="515"></A>were descended from the Cimbri and Teutones, who, when they were marching 
<A NAME="516"></A>into our province and Italy, having deposited on this side the river Rhine 
<A NAME="517"></A>such of their baggage-trains as they could not drive or convey with them, 
<A NAME="518"></A>left 6,000 of their men as a guard and defense for them. These having, 
<A NAME="519"></A>after the destruction of their countrymen, been harassed for many years 
<A NAME="520"></A>by their neighbors, while one time they waged war offensively, and at another 
<A NAME="521"></A>resisted it when waged against them, concluded a peace with the consent 
<A NAME="522"></A>of all, and chose this place as their settlement.
<A NAME="523"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 30</B>
<A NAME="524"></A><BR><BR>And on the first arrival of our army they made frequent sallies 
<A NAME="525"></A>from the town, and contended with our men in trifling skirmishes; afterward, 
<A NAME="526"></A>when hemmed in by a rampart of twelve feet [in height], and fifteen miles 
<A NAME="527"></A>in circuit, they kept themselves within the town. When, vineae having been 
<A NAME="528"></A>brought up and a mound raised, they observed that a tower also was being 
<A NAME="529"></A>built at a distance, they at first began to mock the Romans from their 
<A NAME="530"></A>wall, and to taunt them with the following speeches. "For what purpose 
<A NAME="531"></A>was so vast a machine constructed at so great a distance? With what hands," 
<A NAME="532"></A>or "with what strength did they, especially [as they were] men of such 
<A NAME="533"></A>very small stature" (for our shortness of stature, in comparison to the 
<A NAME="534"></A>great size of their bodies, is generally a subject of much contempt to 
<A NAME="535"></A>the men of Gaul) "trust to place against their walls a tower of such great 
<A NAME="536"></A>weight."
<A NAME="537"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 31</B>
<A NAME="538"></A><BR><BR>But when they saw that it was being moved, and was approaching 
<A NAME="539"></A>their walls, startled by the new and unaccustomed sight, they sent embassadors 
<A NAME="540"></A>to Caesar [to treat] about peace; who spoke in the following manner: "That 
<A NAME="541"></A>they did not believe the Romans waged war without divine aid, since they 
<A NAME="542"></A>were able to move forward machines of such a height with so great speed, 
<A NAME="543"></A>and thus fight from close quarters; that they resigned themselves and all 
<A NAME="544"></A>their possessions to [Caesar's] disposal: that they begged and earnestly 
<A NAME="545"></A>entreated one thing, viz., that if perchance, agreeable to his clemency 
<A NAME="546"></A>and humanity, which they had heard of from others, he should resolve that 
<A NAME="547"></A>the Aduatuci were to be spared, he would not deprive them of their arms; 
<A NAME="548"></A>that all their neighbors were enemies to them and envied their courage, 
<A NAME="549"></A>from whom they could not defend themselves if their arms were delivered 
<A NAME="550"></A>up: that it was better for them, if they should be reduced to that state, 
<A NAME="551"></A>to suffer any fate from the Roman people, than to be tortured to death 
<A NAME="552"></A>by those among whom they had been accustomed to rule."
<A NAME="553"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 32</B>
<A NAME="554"></A><BR><BR>To these things Caesar replied, "That he, in accordance with his 
<A NAME="555"></A>custom, rather than owing to their desert, should spare the state, if they 
<A NAME="556"></A>should surrender themselves before the battering-ram should touch the wall; 
<A NAME="557"></A>but that there was no condition of surrender, except upon their arms being 
<A NAME="558"></A>delivered up; that he should do to them that which he had done in the case 
<A NAME="559"></A>of the Nervii, and would command their neighbors not to offer any injury 
<A NAME="560"></A>to those who had surrendered to the Roman people." The matter being reported 
<A NAME="561"></A>to their countrymen, they said that they would execute his commands. Having 
<A NAME="562"></A>cast a very large quantity of their arms from the wall into the trench 
<A NAME="563"></A>that was before the town, so that the heaps of arms almost equalled the 
<A NAME="564"></A>top of the wall and the rampart, and nevertheless having retained and concealed, 
<A NAME="565"></A>as we afterward discovered, about a third part in the town, the gates were 
<A NAME="566"></A>opened, and they enjoyed peace for that day.
<A NAME="567"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 33</B>
<A NAME="568"></A><BR><BR>Toward evening Caesar ordered the gates to be shut, and the soldiers 
<A NAME="569"></A>to go out of the town, lest the towns-people should receive any injury 
<A NAME="570"></A>from them by night. They [the Aduatuci], by a design before entered into, 
<A NAME="571"></A>as we afterwards understood, because they believed that, as a surrender 
<A NAME="572"></A>had been made, our men would dismiss their guards, or at least would keep 
<A NAME="573"></A>watch less carefully, partly with those arms which they had retained and 
<A NAME="574"></A>concealed, partly with shields made of bark or interwoven wickers, which 
<A NAME="575"></A>they had hastily covered over with skins, (as the shortness of time required) 
<A NAME="576"></A>in the third watch, suddenly made a sally from the town with all their 
<A NAME="577"></A>forces [in that direction] in which the ascent to our fortifications seemed 
<A NAME="578"></A>the least difficult. The signal having been immediately given by fires, 
<A NAME="579"></A>as Caesar had previously commended, a rush was made thither [i. e. by the 
<A NAME="580"></A>Roman soldiers] from the nearest fort; and the battle was fought by the 
<A NAME="581"></A>enemy as vigorously as it ought to be fought by brave men, in the last 
<A NAME="582"></A>hope of safety, in a disadvantageous place, and against those who were 
<A NAME="583"></A>throwing their weapons from a rampart and from towers; since all hope of 
<A NAME="584"></A>safety depended on their courage alone. About 4,000 of the men having been 
<A NAME="585"></A>slain, the rest were forced back into the town. The day after, Caesar, 
<A NAME="586"></A>after breaking open the gates, which there was no one then to defend, and 
<A NAME="587"></A>sending in our soldiers, sold the whole spoil of that town. The number 
<A NAME="588"></A>of 53,000 persons was reported to him by those who had bought 
<A NAME="589"></A>them.
<A NAME="590"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 34</B>
<A NAME="591"></A><BR><BR>At the same time he was informed by P. Crassus, whom he had sent 
<A NAME="592"></A>with one legion against the Veneti, the Unelli, the Osismii, the Curiosolitae, 
<A NAME="593"></A>the Sesuvii, the Aulerci, and the Rhedones, which are maritime states, 
<A NAME="594"></A>and touch upon the [Atlantic] ocean, that all these nations were brought 
<A NAME="595"></A>under the dominion and power of the Roman people.
<A NAME="596"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 35</B>
<A NAME="597"></A><BR><BR>These things being achieved, [and] all Gaul being subdued, so high 
<A NAME="598"></A>an opinion of this war was spread among the barbarians, that embassadors 
<A NAME="599"></A>were sent to Caesar by those nations who dwelt beyond the Rhine, to promise 
<A NAME="600"></A>that they would give hostages and execute his commands. Which embassies 
<A NAME="601"></A>Caesar, because he was hastening into Italy and Illyricum, ordered to return 
<A NAME="602"></A>to him at the beginning of the following summer. He himself, having led 
<A NAME="603"></A>his legions into winter quarters among the Carnutes, the Andes, and the 
<A NAME="604"></A>Turones, which states were close to those regions in which he had waged 
<A NAME="605"></A>war, set out for Italy; and a thanksgiving of fifteen days was decreed 
<A NAME="606"></A>for those achievements, upon receiving Caesar's letter; [an honor] which 
<A NAME="607"></A>before that time had been conferred on none.
