<A NAME="start"></A>
<A NAME="10"></A><B>Chapter 1</B>
<A NAME="11"></A><BR><BR>While these things were going forward in Spain, Caius Trebonius, 
<A NAME="12"></A>Caesar's lieutenant, who had been left to conduct the assault of Massilia, 
<A NAME="13"></A>began to raise a mound, vineae, and turrets against the town, on two sides; 
<A NAME="14"></A>one of which was next the harbor and docks, the other on that part where 
<A NAME="15"></A>there is a passage from Gaul and Spain to that sea which forces itself 
<A NAME="16"></A>up the mouth of the Rhone. For Massilia is washed almost on three sides 
<A NAME="17"></A>by the sea, the remaining fourth part is the only side which has access 
<A NAME="18"></A>by land. A part even of this space, which reaches to the fortress, being 
<A NAME="19"></A>fortified by the nature of the country, and a very deep valley, required 
<A NAME="20"></A>a long and difficult siege. To accomplish these works, Caius Trebonius 
<A NAME="21"></A>sends for a great quantity of carriages and men from the whole Province, 
<A NAME="22"></A>and orders hurdles and materials to be furnished. These things being provided, 
<A NAME="23"></A>he raised a mound eighty feet in height.
<A NAME="24"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 2</B>
<A NAME="25"></A><BR><BR>But so great a store of every thing necessary for a war had been 
<A NAME="26"></A>a long time before laid up in the town, and so great a number of engines, 
<A NAME="27"></A>that no vineae made of hurdles could withstand their force. For poles twelve 
<A NAME="28"></A>feet in length, pointed with iron, and these too shot from very large engines, 
<A NAME="29"></A>sank into the ground through four rows of hurdles. Therefore the arches 
<A NAME="30"></A>of the vineae were covered over with beams a foot thick, fastened together, 
<A NAME="31"></A>and under this the materials of the agger were handed from one to another. 
<A NAME="32"></A>Before this was carried a testudo sixty feet long, for leveling the ground, 
<A NAME="33"></A>made also of very strong timber, and covered over with every thing that 
<A NAME="34"></A>was capable of protecting it against the fire and stones thrown by the 
<A NAME="35"></A>enemy. But the greatness of the works, the height of the wall and towers, 
<A NAME="36"></A>and the multitude of engines retarded the progress of our works. Besides, 
<A NAME="37"></A>frequent sallies were made from the town by the Albici, and fire was thrown 
<A NAME="38"></A>on our mound and turrets. These our men easily repulsed, and, doing considerable 
<A NAME="39"></A>damage to those who sallied, beat them back into the 
<A NAME="40"></A>town.
<A NAME="41"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 3</B>
<A NAME="42"></A><BR><BR>In the mean time, Lucius Nasidius, being sent by Cneius Pompey 
<A NAME="43"></A>with a fleet of sixteen sail, a few of which had beaks of brass, to the 
<A NAME="44"></A>assistance of Lucius Domitius and the Massilians, passed the straits of 
<A NAME="45"></A>Sicily without the knowledge or expectation of Curio, and, putting with 
<A NAME="46"></A>his fleet into Messana, and making the nobles and senate take flight with 
<A NAME="47"></A>the sudden terror, carried off one of their ships out of dock. Having joined 
<A NAME="48"></A>this to his other ships, he made good his voyage to Massilia, and having 
<A NAME="49"></A>sent in a galley privately, acquaints Domitius and the Massilians of his 
<A NAME="50"></A>arrival, and earnestly encourages them to hazard another battle with Brutus's 
<A NAME="51"></A>fleet with the addition of his aid.
<A NAME="52"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 4</B>
<A NAME="53"></A><BR><BR>The Massilians, since their former loss, had brought the same number 
<A NAME="54"></A>of old ships from the docks, and had repaired and fitted them out with 
<A NAME="55"></A>great industry: they had a large supply of seamen and pilots. They had 
<A NAME="56"></A>got several fishing-smacks, and covered them over, that the seamen might 
<A NAME="57"></A>be secure against darts: these they filled with archers and engines. With 
<A NAME="58"></A>a fleet thus appointed, encouraged by the entreaties and tears of all the 
<A NAME="59"></A>old men, matrons, and virgins to succor the state in this hour of distress, 
<A NAME="60"></A>they went on board with no less spirit and confidence than they had fought 
<A NAME="61"></A>before. For it happens, from a common infirmity of human nature, that we 
<A NAME="62"></A>are more flushed with confidence, or more vehemently alarmed at things 
<A NAME="63"></A>unseen, concealed, and unknown, as was the case then. For the arrival of 
<A NAME="64"></A>Lucius Nasidius had filled the state with the most sanguine hopes and wishes. 
<A NAME="65"></A>Having got a fair wind, they sailed out of port and went to Nasidius to 
<A NAME="66"></A>Taurois, which is a fort belonging to the Massilians, and there ranged 
<A NAME="67"></A>their fleet and again encouraged each other to engage and communicated 
<A NAME="68"></A>their plan of operation. The command of the right division was given to 
<A NAME="69"></A>the Massilians, that of the left to Nasidius.
<A NAME="70"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 5</B>
<A NAME="71"></A><BR><BR>Brutus sailed to the same place with an augmented fleet; for to 
<A NAME="72"></A>those made by Caesar at Arelas were added six ships taken from the Massilians, 
<A NAME="73"></A>which he had refitted since the last battle and had furnished with every 
<A NAME="74"></A>necessary. Accordingly, having encouraged his men to despise a vanquished 
<A NAME="75"></A>people whom they had conquered when yet unbroken, he advanced against them 
<A NAME="76"></A>full of confidence and spirit. From Trebonius's camp and all the higher 
<A NAME="77"></A>grounds it was easy to see into the town - how all the youth which remained 
<A NAME="78"></A>in it, and all persons of more advanced years, with their wives and children, 
<A NAME="79"></A>and the public guards, were either extending their hands from the wall 
<A NAME="80"></A>to the heavens, or were repairing to the temples of the immortal gods, 
<A NAME="81"></A>and prostrating themselves before their images, were entreating them to 
<A NAME="82"></A>grant them victory. Nor was there a single person who did not imagine that 
<A NAME="83"></A>his future fortune depended on the issue of that day; for the choice of 
<A NAME="84"></A>their youth and the most respectable of every age, being expressly invited 
<A NAME="85"></A>and solicited, had gone on board the fleet, that if any adverse fate should 
<A NAME="86"></A>befall them they might see that nothing was left for them to attempt, and, 
<A NAME="87"></A>if they proved victorious, they might have hopes of preserving the city, 
<A NAME="88"></A>either by their internal resources or by foreign assistance.
<A NAME="89"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 6</B>
<A NAME="90"></A><BR><BR>When the battle was begun, no effort of valor was wanting to the 
<A NAME="91"></A>Massilians, but, mindful of the instructions which they had a little before 
<A NAME="92"></A>received from their friends, they fought with such spirit as if they supposed 
<A NAME="93"></A>that they would never have another opportunity to attempt a defense, and 
<A NAME="94"></A>as if they believed that those whose lives should be endangered in the 
<A NAME="95"></A>battle would not long precede the fate of the rest of the citizens, who, 
<A NAME="96"></A>if the city was taken, must undergo the same fortune of war. Our ships 
<A NAME="97"></A>being at some distance from each other, room was allowed both for the skill 
<A NAME="98"></A>of their pilots and the maueuvering of their ships; and if at any time 
<A NAME="99"></A>ours, gaining an advantage by casting the iron hooks on board their ships, 
<A NAME="100"></A>grappled with them, from all parts they assisted those who were distressed. 
<A NAME="101"></A>Nor, after being joined by the Albici, did they decline coming to close 
<A NAME="102"></A>engagement, nor were they much inferior to our men in valor. At the same 
<A NAME="103"></A>time, showers of darts, thrown from a distance from the lesser ships, suddenly 
<A NAME="104"></A>inflicted several wounds on our men when off their guard and otherwise 
<A NAME="105"></A>engaged; and two of their three-decked galleys; having descried the ship 
<A NAME="106"></A>of Decimus Brutus, which could be easily distinguished by its flag, rowed 
<A NAME="107"></A>up against him with great violence from opposite sides: but Brutus, seeing 
<A NAME="108"></A>into their designs, by the swiftness of his ship extricated himself with 
<A NAME="109"></A>such address as to get clear, though only by a moment. From the velocity 
<A NAME="110"></A>of their motion they struck against each other with such violence that 
<A NAME="111"></A>they were both excessively injured by the shock; the beak, indeed, of one 
<A NAME="112"></A>of them being broken off, the whole ship was ready to founder, which circumstance 
<A NAME="113"></A>being observed, the ships of Brutus's fleet, which were nearest that station, 
<A NAME="114"></A>attack them when in this disorder and sink them both.
<A NAME="115"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 7</B>
<A NAME="116"></A><BR><BR>But Nasidius's ships were of no use, and soon left the fight; for 
<A NAME="117"></A>the sight of their country, or the entreaties of their relations, did not 
<A NAME="118"></A>urge them to run a desperate risk of their lives. Therefore, of the number 
<A NAME="119"></A>of the ships not one was lost: of the fleet of the Massilians five were 
<A NAME="120"></A>sunk, four taken, and one ran off with Nasidius: all that escaped made 
<A NAME="121"></A>the best of their way to Hither Spain, but one of the rest was sent forward 
<A NAME="122"></A>to Massilia for the purpose of bearing this intelligence, and when it came 
<A NAME="123"></A>near the city, the whole people crowded out to hear the tidings, and, on 
<A NAME="124"></A>being informed of the event, were so oppressed with grief, that one would 
<A NAME="125"></A>have imagined that the city had been taken by an enemy at the same moment. 
<A NAME="126"></A>The Massilians, however, began to make the necessary preparations for the 
<A NAME="127"></A>defense of their city with unwearied energy.
<A NAME="128"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 8</B>
<A NAME="129"></A><BR><BR>The legionary soldiers who had the management of the works on the 
<A NAME="130"></A>right side, observed, from the frequent sallies of the enemy, that it might 
<A NAME="131"></A>prove a great protection to them to build a turret of brick under the wall 
<A NAME="132"></A>for a fort and place of refuge, which they at first built low and small, 
<A NAME="133"></A>[to guard them] against sudden attacks. To it they retreated, and from 
<A NAME="134"></A>it they made defense if any superior force attacked them; and from it they 
<A NAME="135"></A>sallied out either to repel or pursue the enemy. It extended thirty feet 
<A NAME="136"></A>on every side, and the thickness of the walls was five feet. But afterward, 
<A NAME="137"></A>as experience is the best master in every thing on which the wit of man 
<A NAME="138"></A>is employed, it was found that it might be of considerable service if it 
<A NAME="139"></A>was raised to the usual height of turrets, which was effected in the following 
<A NAME="140"></A>manner.
<A NAME="141"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 9</B>
<A NAME="142"></A><BR><BR>When the turret was raised to the height for flooring, they laid 
<A NAME="143"></A>it on the walls in such a manner that the ends of the joists were covered 
<A NAME="144"></A>by the outer face of the wall, that nothing should project to which the 
<A NAME="145"></A>enemy's fire might adhere. They, moreover, built over the joists with small 
<A NAME="146"></A>bricks as high as the protection of the plutei and vineae permitted them; 
<A NAME="147"></A>and on that place they laid two beams across, angle-ways, at a small distance 
<A NAME="148"></A>from the outer walls, to support the rafters which were to cover the turret, 
<A NAME="149"></A>and on the beams they laid joists across in a direct line, and on these 
<A NAME="150"></A>they fastened down planks. These joists they made somewhat longer, to project 
<A NAME="151"></A>beyond the outside of the wall, that they might serve to hang a curtain 
<A NAME="152"></A>on them to defend and repel all blows while they were building the walls 
<A NAME="153"></A>between that and the next floor, and the floor of this story they faced 
<A NAME="154"></A>with bricks and mortar, that the enemy's fire might do them no damage; 
<A NAME="155"></A>and on this they spread mattresses, lest the weapons thrown from engines 
<A NAME="156"></A>should break through the flooring, or stones from catapults should batter 
<A NAME="157"></A>the brick work. They, moreover, made three mats of cable ropes, each of 
<A NAME="158"></A>them the length of the turret walls, and four feet broad, and, hanging 
<A NAME="159"></A>them round the turret on the three sides which faced the enemy, fastened 
<A NAME="160"></A>them to the projecting joists. For this was the only sort of defense which, 
<A NAME="161"></A>they had learned by experience in other places, could not be pierced by 
<A NAME="162"></A>darts or engines. But when that part of the turret which was completed 
<A NAME="163"></A>was protected and secured against every attempt of the enemy, they removed 
<A NAME="164"></A>the plutei to other works. They began to suspend gradually, and raise by 
<A NAME="165"></A>screws from the first-floor, the entire roof of the turret, and then they 
<A NAME="166"></A>elevated it as high as the length of the mats allowed. Hid and secured 
<A NAME="167"></A>within these coverings, they built up the walls with bricks, and again, 
<A NAME="168"></A>by another turn of the screw, cleared a place for themselves to proceed 
<A NAME="169"></A>with the building; and, when they thought it time to lay another floor, 
<A NAME="170"></A>they laid the ends of the beams, covered in by the outer bricks in like 
<A NAME="171"></A>manner as in the first story, and from that story they again raised the 
<A NAME="172"></A>uppermost floor and the mat-work. In this manner, securely and without 
<A NAME="173"></A>a blow or danger, they raised it six stories high, and in laying the materials 
<A NAME="174"></A>left loop-holes in such places as they thought proper for working their 
<A NAME="175"></A>engines.
<A NAME="176"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 10</B>
<A NAME="177"></A><BR><BR>When they were confident that they could protect the works which 
<A NAME="178"></A>lay around from this turret, they resolved to build a musculus, sixty feet 
<A NAME="179"></A>long, of timber, two feet square, and to extend it from the brick tower 
<A NAME="180"></A>to the enemy's tower and wall. This was the form of it: first, two beams 
<A NAME="181"></A>of equal length were laid on the ground, at the distance of four feet from 
<A NAME="182"></A>each other; and in them were fastened small pillars, five feet high, which 
<A NAME="183"></A>were joined together by braces, with a gentle slope, on which the timber 
<A NAME="184"></A>which they must place to support the roof of the musculus should be laid: 
<A NAME="185"></A>upon this were laid beams, two feet square, bound with iron plates and 
<A NAME="186"></A>nails. To the upper covering of the musculus and the upper beams, they 
<A NAME="187"></A>fastened laths, four fingers square, to support the tiles which were to 
<A NAME="188"></A>cover the musculus. The roof being thus sloped and laid over in rows in 
<A NAME="189"></A>the same manner as the joists were laid on the braces, the musculus was 
<A NAME="190"></A>covered with tiles and mortar, to secure it against fire, which might be 
<A NAME="191"></A>thrown from the wall. Over the tiles hides are spread, to prevent the water 
<A NAME="192"></A>let in on them by spouts from dissolving the cement of the bricks. Again, 
<A NAME="193"></A>the hides were covered over with mattresses, that they might not be destroyed 
<A NAME="194"></A>by fire or stones. The soldiers under the protection of the vineae, finish 
<A NAME="195"></A>this whole work to the very tower; and suddenly, before the enemy were 
<A NAME="196"></A>aware of it, moved it forward by naval machinery, by putting rollers under 
<A NAME="197"></A>it, close up to the enemy's turret, so that it even touched the 
<A NAME="198"></A>building.
<A NAME="199"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 11</B>
<A NAME="200"></A><BR><BR>The townsmen, affrighted at this unexpected stroke, bring forward 
<A NAME="201"></A>with levers the largest stones they can procure, and pitching them from 
<A NAME="202"></A>the wall, roll them down on the musculus. The strength of the timber withstood 
<A NAME="203"></A>the shock; and whatever fell on it slid off, on account of the sloping 
<A NAME="204"></A>roof. When they perceived this, they altered their plan, and set fire to 
<A NAME="205"></A>barrels, filled with resin and tar, and rolled them down from the wall 
<A NAME="206"></A>on the musculus. As soon as they fell on it, they slid off again, and were 
<A NAME="207"></A>removed from its side by long poles and forks. In the mean time, the soldiers, 
<A NAME="208"></A>under cover of the musculus, were rooting out with crow-bars the lowest 
<A NAME="209"></A>stones of the enemy's turret, with which the foundation was laid. The musculus 
<A NAME="210"></A>was defended by darts, thrown from engines by our men from the brick tower, 
<A NAME="211"></A>and the enemy were beaten off from the wall and turrets; nor was a fair 
<A NAME="212"></A>opportunity of defending the walls given them. At length several stones 
<A NAME="213"></A>being picked away from the foundation of that turret next the musculus, 
<A NAME="214"></A>part of it fell down suddenly, and the rest, as if following it, leaned 
<A NAME="215"></A>forward.
<A NAME="216"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 12</B>
<A NAME="217"></A><BR><BR>Hereupon, the enemy distressed at the sudden fall of the turret, 
<A NAME="218"></A>surprised at the unforeseen calamity, awed by the wrath of the gods, and 
<A NAME="219"></A>dreading the pillage of their city, rush all together out of the gate unarmed, 
<A NAME="220"></A>with their temples bound with fillets, and suppliantly stretch out their 
<A NAME="221"></A>hands to the officers and the army. At this uncommon occurrence, the whole 
<A NAME="222"></A>progress of the war was stopped, and the soldiers, turning away from the 
<A NAME="223"></A>battle, ran eagerly to hear and listen to them. When the enemy came up 
<A NAME="224"></A>to the commanders and the army, they all fell down at their feet, and besought 
<A NAME="225"></A>them "to wait till Caesar's arrival; they saw that their city was taken, 
<A NAME="226"></A>our works completed, and their tower undermined, therefore they desisted 
<A NAME="227"></A>from a defense; that no obstacle could arise, to prevent their being instantly 
<A NAME="228"></A>plundered at a beck, as soon as he arrived, if they refused to submit to 
<A NAME="229"></A>his orders." They inform them that, "if the turret had entirely fallen 
<A NAME="230"></A>down, the soldiers could not be withheld from forcing into the town and 
<A NAME="231"></A>sacking it, in hopes of getting spoil." These and several other arguments 
<A NAME="232"></A>to the same effect were delivered, as they were a people of great learning, 
<A NAME="233"></A>with great pathos and lamentations.
<A NAME="234"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 13</B>
<A NAME="235"></A><BR><BR>The lieutenants moved with compassion, draw off the soldiers from 
<A NAME="236"></A>the work, desist from the assault, and leave sentinels on the works. A 
<A NAME="237"></A>sort of truce having been made through compassion for the besieged, the 
<A NAME="238"></A>arrival of Caesar is anxiously awaited; not a dart was thrown from the 
<A NAME="239"></A>walls or by our men, but all remit their care and diligence, as if the 
<A NAME="240"></A>business was at an end. For Caesar had given Trebonius strict charge not 
<A NAME="241"></A>to suffer the town to be taken by storm, lest the soldiers, too much irritated 
<A NAME="242"></A>both by abhorrence of their revolt, by the contempt shown to them, and 
<A NAME="243"></A>by their long labor, should put to the sword all the grown up inhabitants, 
<A NAME="244"></A>as they threatened to do. And it was with difficulty that they were then 
<A NAME="245"></A>restrained from breaking into the town, and they were much displeased, 
<A NAME="246"></A>because they imagined that they were prevented by Trebonius from taking 
<A NAME="247"></A>possession of it.
<A NAME="248"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 14</B>
<A NAME="249"></A><BR><BR>But the enemy, destitute of all honor, only waited a time and opportunity 
<A NAME="250"></A>for fraud and treachery. And after an interval of some days, when our men 
<A NAME="251"></A>were careless and negligent, on a sudden, at noon, when some were dispersed, 
<A NAME="252"></A>and others indulging themselves in rest on the very works, after the fatigue 
<A NAME="253"></A>of the day, and their arms were all laid by and covered up, they sallied 
<A NAME="254"></A>out from the gates, and, the wind being high and favorable to them, they 
<A NAME="255"></A>set fire to our works; and the wind spread it in such a manner that, in 
<A NAME="256"></A>the same instant, the agger, plutei, testudo, tower, and engines all caught 
<A NAME="257"></A>the flames and were consumed before we could conceive how it had occurred. 
<A NAME="258"></A>Our men, alarmed at such an unexpected turn of fortune, lay hold on such 
<A NAME="259"></A>arms as they could find. Some rush from the camp; an attack is made on 
<A NAME="260"></A>the enemy: but they were prevented, by arrows and engines from the walls; 
<A NAME="261"></A>from pursuing them when they fled. They retired to their walls, and there, 
<A NAME="262"></A>without fear, set the musculus and brick tower on fire. Thus, by the perfidy 
<A NAME="263"></A>of the enemy and the violence of the storm, the labor of many months was 
<A NAME="264"></A>destroyed in a moment. The Massilians made the same attempt the next day, 
<A NAME="265"></A>having got such another storm. They sallied out against the other tower 
<A NAME="266"></A>and agger, and fought with more confidence. But as our men had on the former 
<A NAME="267"></A>occasion given up all thoughts of a contest, so, warned by the event of 
<A NAME="268"></A>the preceding day, they had made every preparation for a defense. Accordingly, 
<A NAME="269"></A>they slew several, and forced the rest to retreat into the town without 
<A NAME="270"></A>effecting their design.
<A NAME="271"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 15</B>
<A NAME="272"></A><BR><BR>Trebonius began to provide and repair what had been destroyed, 
<A NAME="273"></A>with much greater zeal on the part of the soldiers; for when they saw that 
<A NAME="274"></A>their extraordinary pains and preparations had an unfortunate issue, they 
<A NAME="275"></A>were fired with indignation that, in consequence of the impious violation 
<A NAME="276"></A>of the truce, their valor should be held in derision. There was no place 
<A NAME="277"></A>left them from which the materials for their mound could be fetched, in 
<A NAME="278"></A>consequence of all the timber, far and wide, in the territories of the 
<A NAME="279"></A>Massilians, having been cut down and carried away; they began therefore 
<A NAME="280"></A>to make an agger of a new construction, never heard of before, of two walls 
<A NAME="281"></A>of brick, each six feet thick, and to lay floors over them of almost the 
<A NAME="282"></A>same breadth with the agger, made of timber. But wherever the space between 
<A NAME="283"></A>the walls, or the weakness of the timber, seemed to require it, pillars 
<A NAME="284"></A>were placed underneath and traversed beams laid on to strengthen the work, 
<A NAME="285"></A>and the space which was floored was covered over with hurdles, and the 
<A NAME="286"></A>hurdles plastered over with mortar. The soldiers, covered over head by 
<A NAME="287"></A>the floor, on the right and left by the wall, and in the front by the mantlets, 
<A NAME="288"></A>carried whatever materials were necessary for the building without danger: 
<A NAME="289"></A>the business was soon finished - the loss of their laborious work was soon 
<A NAME="290"></A>repaired by the dexterity and fortitude of the soldiers. Gates for making 
<A NAME="291"></A>sallies were left in the wall in such places as they thought 
<A NAME="292"></A>proper.
<A NAME="293"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 16</B>
<A NAME="294"></A><BR><BR>But when the enemy perceived that those works, which they had hoped 
<A NAME="295"></A>could not be replaced without a great length of time, were put into so 
<A NAME="296"></A>thorough repair by a few day's labor and diligence, that there was no room 
<A NAME="297"></A>for perfidy or sallies, and that no means were left them by which they 
<A NAME="298"></A>could either hurt the men by resistance or the works by fire, and when 
<A NAME="299"></A>they found by former examples that their town could be surrounded with 
<A NAME="300"></A>a wall and turrets on every part by which it was accessible by land, in 
<A NAME="301"></A>such a manner that they could not have room to stand on their own fortifications, 
<A NAME="302"></A>because our works were built almost on the top of their walls by our army, 
<A NAME="303"></A>and darts could be thrown from our hands, and when they perceived that 
<A NAME="304"></A>all advantage arising from their engines, on which they had built great 
<A NAME="305"></A>hopes, was totally lost, and that though they had an opportunity of fighting 
<A NAME="306"></A>with us on equal terms from walls and turrets, they could perceive that 
<A NAME="307"></A>they were not equal to our men in bravery, they had recourse to the same 
<A NAME="308"></A>proposals of surrender as before.
<A NAME="309"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 17</B>
<A NAME="310"></A><BR><BR>In Further Spain, Marcus Varro, in the beginning of the disturbances, 
<A NAME="311"></A>when he heard of the circumstances which took place in Italy, being diffident 
<A NAME="312"></A>of Pompey's success, used to speak in a very friendly manner of Caesar. 
<A NAME="313"></A>That though, being pre-engaged to Cneius Pompey in quality of lieutenant, 
<A NAME="314"></A>he was bound in honor to him, that, nevertheless, there existed a very 
<A NAME="315"></A>intimate tie between him and Caesar; that he was not ignorant of what was 
<A NAME="316"></A>the duty of a lieutenant, who bore an office of trust; nor of his own strength, 
<A NAME="317"></A>nor of the disposition of the whole province to Caesar. These sentiments 
<A NAME="318"></A>he constantly expressed in his ordinary conversation, and did not attach 
<A NAME="319"></A>himself to either party. But afterward, when he found that Caesar was detained 
<A NAME="320"></A>before Massilia, that the forces of Petreius had effected a junction with 
<A NAME="321"></A>the army of Afranius, that considerable reinforcements had come to their 
<A NAME="322"></A>assistance, that there were great hopes and expectations, and heard that 
<A NAME="323"></A>the whole Hither province had entered into a confederacy, and of the difficulties 
<A NAME="324"></A>to which Caesar was reduced afterward at Ilerda for want of provisions, 
<A NAME="325"></A>and Afranius wrote to him a fuller and more exaggerated account of these 
<A NAME="326"></A>matters, he began to regulate his movements by those of 
<A NAME="327"></A>fortune.
<A NAME="328"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 18</B>
<A NAME="329"></A><BR><BR>He made levies throughout the province; and, having completed his 
<A NAME="330"></A>two legions, he added to them about thirty auxiliary cohorts; he collected 
<A NAME="331"></A>a large quantity of corn to send partly to the Masilians, partly to Afranius 
<A NAME="332"></A>and Petreius. He commanded the inhabitants of Gades to build ten ships 
<A NAME="333"></A>of war; besides, he took care that several others should be built in Spain. 
<A NAME="334"></A>He removed all the money and ornaments from the temple of Hercules to the 
<A NAME="335"></A>town of Gades, and sent six cohorts thither from the province to guard 
<A NAME="336"></A>them, and gave the command of the town of Gades to Caius Gallonius, a Roman 
<A NAME="337"></A>knight, and friend of Domitius, who had come thither sent by Domitius to 
<A NAME="338"></A>recover an estate for him; and he deposited all the arms, both public and 
<A NAME="339"></A>private, in Gallonius's house. He himself [Varro] made severe harangues 
<A NAME="340"></A>against Caesar. He often pronounced from his tribunal that Caesar had fought 
<A NAME="341"></A>several unsuccessful battles, and that a great number of his men had deserted 
<A NAME="342"></A>to Afranius. That he had these accounts from undoubted messengers, and 
<A NAME="343"></A>authority on which he could rely. By these means he terrified the Roman 
<A NAME="344"></A>citizens of that province, and obliged them to promise him for the service 
<A NAME="345"></A>of the state one hundred and ninety thousand sesterces, twenty thousand 
<A NAME="346"></A>pounds weight of silver, and a hundred and twenty thousand bushels of wheat. 
<A NAME="347"></A>He laid heavier burdens on those states which he thought were friendly 
<A NAME="348"></A>disposed to Caesar, and billeted troops on them; he passed judgment against 
<A NAME="349"></A>some private persons, and condemned to confiscation the properties of those 
<A NAME="350"></A>who had spoken or made orations against the republic, and forced the whole 
<A NAME="351"></A>province to take an oath of allegiance to him and Pompey. Being informed 
<A NAME="352"></A>of all that happened in Hither Spain, he prepared for war. This was his 
<A NAME="353"></A>plan of operations. He was to retire with his two legions to Gades, and 
<A NAME="354"></A>to lay up all the shipping and provisions there. For he had been informed 
<A NAME="355"></A>that the whole province was inclined to favor Caesar's party. He thought 
<A NAME="356"></A>that the war might be easily protracted in an island, if he was provided 
<A NAME="357"></A>with corn and shipping. Caesar, although called back to Italy by many and 
<A NAME="358"></A>important matters, yet had determined to leave no dregs of war behind him 
<A NAME="359"></A>in Spain, because he knew that Pompey had many dependents and clients in 
<A NAME="360"></A>the hither province.
<A NAME="361"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 19</B>
<A NAME="362"></A><BR><BR>Having therefore sent two legions into Further Spain under the 
<A NAME="363"></A>command of Quintus Cassius, tribune of the people; he himself advances 
<A NAME="364"></A>with six hundred horse by forced marches, and issues a proclamation, appointing 
<A NAME="365"></A>a day on which the magistrates and nobility of all the states should attend 
<A NAME="366"></A>him at Corduba. This proclamation being published through the whole province, 
<A NAME="367"></A>there was not a state that did not send a part of their senate to Corduba, 
<A NAME="368"></A>at the appointed time; and not a Roman citizen of any note but appeared 
<A NAME="369"></A>that day. At the same time the senate at Corduba shut the gates of their 
<A NAME="370"></A>own accord against Varro, and posted guards and sentinels on the wall and 
<A NAME="371"></A>in the turrets, and detained two cohorts (called Colonicae, which had come 
<A NAME="372"></A>there accidentally), for the defense of the town. About the same time the 
<A NAME="373"></A>people of Carmona, which is by far the strongest state in the whole province, 
<A NAME="374"></A>of themselves drove out of the town the cohorts, and shut the gates against 
<A NAME="375"></A>them, although three cohorts had been detached by Varro to garrison the 
<A NAME="376"></A>citadel.
<A NAME="377"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 20</B>
<A NAME="378"></A><BR><BR>But Varro was in greater haste on this account to reach Gades with 
<A NAME="379"></A>his legion as soon as possible, lest he should be stopped either on his 
<A NAME="380"></A>march or on crossing over to the island. The affection of the province 
<A NAME="381"></A>to Caesar proved so great and so favorable, that he received a letter from 
<A NAME="382"></A>Gades, before he was far advanced on his march: that as soon as the nobility 
<A NAME="383"></A>of Gades heard of Caesar's proclamation, they had combined with the tribune 
<A NAME="384"></A>of the cohorts, which were in garrison there, to drive Gallonius out of 
<A NAME="385"></A>the town, and to secure the city and island for Caesar. That having agreed 
<A NAME="386"></A>on the design they had sent notice to Gallonius, to quit Gades of his own 
<A NAME="387"></A>accord while he could do it with safety; if he did not, they would take 
<A NAME="388"></A>measures for themselves; that for fear of this Gallonius had been induced 
<A NAME="389"></A>to quit the town. When this was known, one of Varro's two legions, which 
<A NAME="390"></A>was called Vernacula, carried off the colors from Varro's camp, he himself 
<A NAME="391"></A>standing by and looking on, and retired to Hispalis, and took post in the 
<A NAME="392"></A>market and public places without doing any injury, and the Roman citizens 
<A NAME="393"></A>residing there approved so highly of this act, that every one most earnestly 
<A NAME="394"></A>offered to entertain them in their houses. When Varro, terrified at these 
<A NAME="395"></A>things, having altered his route, proposed going to Italica, he was informed 
<A NAME="396"></A>by his friends that the gates were shut against him. Then indeed, when 
<A NAME="397"></A>intercepted from every road, he sends word to Caesar, that he was ready 
<A NAME="398"></A>to deliver up the legion which he commanded. He sends to him Sextus Caesar, 
<A NAME="399"></A>and orders him to deliver it up to him. Varro, having delivered up the 
<A NAME="400"></A>legion, went to Caesar to Corduba, and having laid before him the public 
<A NAME="401"></A>accounts, handed over to him most faithfully whatever money he had, and 
<A NAME="402"></A>told him what quantity of corn and shipping he had, and 
<A NAME="403"></A>where.
<A NAME="404"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 21</B>
<A NAME="405"></A><BR><BR>Caesar made a public oration at Corduba, in which he returned thanks 
<A NAME="406"></A>to all severally: to the Roman citizens, because they had been zealous 
<A NAME="407"></A>to keep the town in their own power; to the Spaniards, for having driven 
<A NAME="408"></A>out the garrison; to the Gaditani, for having defeated the attempts of 
<A NAME="409"></A>his enemies, and asserted their own liberty; to the Tribunes and Centurions 
<A NAME="410"></A>who had gone there as a guard, for having by their valor confirmed them 
<A NAME="411"></A>in their purpose. He remitted the tax which the Roman citizens had promised 
<A NAME="412"></A>to Varro for the public use: he restored their goods to those who he was 
<A NAME="413"></A>informed had incurred that penalty by speaking too freely, having given 
<A NAME="414"></A>public and private rewards to some he filled the rest with flattering hopes 
<A NAME="415"></A>of his future intentions; and having staid two days at Corduba, he set 
<A NAME="416"></A>out for Gades; he ordered the money and ornaments which had been carried 
<A NAME="417"></A>away from the temple of Hercules, and lodged in the houses of private persons, 
<A NAME="418"></A>to be replaced in the temple. He made Quintus Cassius governor of the province, 
<A NAME="419"></A>and assigned him four legions. He himself, with those ships which Marcus 
<A NAME="420"></A>Varro had built, and others which the Gaditani had built by Varro's orders, 
<A NAME="421"></A>arrived in a few days at Tarraco, where embassadors from the greatest part 
<A NAME="422"></A>of the nearer province waited his arrival. Having in the same manner conferred 
<A NAME="423"></A>marks of honor both publicly and privately on some states, he left Tarraco, 
<A NAME="424"></A>and went thence by land to Narbo, and thence to Massilia. There he was 
<A NAME="425"></A>informed that a law was passed for creating a dictator, and that he had 
<A NAME="426"></A>been nominated dictator by Marcus Lepidus the praetor.
<A NAME="427"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 22</B>
<A NAME="428"></A><BR><BR>The Massilians, wearied out by misfortunes of every sort, reduced 
<A NAME="429"></A>to the lowest ebb for want of corn, conquered in two engagements at sea, 
<A NAME="430"></A>defeated in their frequent sallies, and struggling moreover with a fatal 
<A NAME="431"></A>pestilence, from their long confinement and change of victuals (for they 
<A NAME="432"></A>all subsisted on old millet and damaged barley, which they had formerly 
<A NAME="433"></A>provided and laid up in the public stores against an emergency of this 
<A NAME="434"></A>kind), their turret being demolished, a great part of their wall having 
<A NAME="435"></A>given way, and despairing of any aid, either from the provinces or their 
<A NAME="436"></A>armies, for these they had heard had fallen into Caesar's power, resolved 
<A NAME="437"></A>to surrender now without dissimulation. But a few days before, Lucius Domitius, 
<A NAME="438"></A>having discovered the intention of the Massilians, and having procured 
<A NAME="439"></A>three ships, two of which he gave up to his friends, went on board the 
<A NAME="440"></A>third himself, having got a brisk wind, put out to sea. Some ships, which 
<A NAME="441"></A>by Brutus's orders were constantly cruising near the port, having espied 
<A NAME="442"></A>him, weighed anchor, and pursued him. But of these, the ship on board of 
<A NAME="443"></A>which he was, persevered itself, and continuing its flight, and by the 
<A NAME="444"></A>aid of the wind got out of sight: the other two, affrighted by the approach 
<A NAME="445"></A>of our galleys put back again into the harbor. The Massilians conveyed 
<A NAME="446"></A>their arms and engines out of the town, as they were ordered: brought their 
<A NAME="447"></A>ships out of the port and docks, and delivered up the money in their treasury. 
<A NAME="448"></A>When these affairs were dispatched, Caesar, sparing the town more out of 
<A NAME="449"></A>regard to their renown and antiquity than to any claim they could lay to 
<A NAME="450"></A>his favor, left two legions in garrison there, sent the rest to Italy, 
<A NAME="451"></A>and set out himself for Rome.
<A NAME="452"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 23</B>
<A NAME="453"></A><BR><BR>About the same time Caius Curio, having sailed from Sicily to Africa, 
<A NAME="454"></A>and from the first despising the forces of Publius Attius Varus, transported 
<A NAME="455"></A>only two of the four legions which he had received from Caesar, and five 
<A NAME="456"></A>hundred horse, and having spent two days and three nights on the voyage, 
<A NAME="457"></A>arrived at a place called Aquilaria, which is about twenty-two miles distant 
<A NAME="458"></A>from Clupea, and in the summer season has a convenient harbor, and is inclosed 
<A NAME="459"></A>by two projecting promontories. Lucius Caesar the son, who was waiting 
<A NAME="460"></A>his arrival near Clupea with ten ships which had been taken near Utica 
<A NAME="461"></A>in a war with the pirates, and which Publius Attius had had repaired for 
<A NAME="462"></A>this war, frightened at the number of our ships, fled the sea, and running 
<A NAME="463"></A>his three-decked covered galley on the nearest shore, left her there and 
<A NAME="464"></A>made his escape by land to Adrumetum. Caius Considius Longus, with a garrison 
<A NAME="465"></A>of one legion, guarded this town. The rest of Caesar's fleet, after his 
<A NAME="466"></A>flight, retired to Adrumetum. Marcus Rufus, the quaestor, pursued him with 
<A NAME="467"></A>twelve ships, which Curio had brought from Sicily as convoy to the merchantmen, 
<A NAME="468"></A>and seeing a ship left on the shore, he brought her off by a towing rope, 
<A NAME="469"></A>and returned with his fleet to Curio.
<A NAME="470"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 24</B>
<A NAME="471"></A><BR><BR>Curio detached Marcus before with the fleet to Utica, and marched 
<A NAME="472"></A>thither with his army. Having advanced two days, he came to the river Bagrada, 
<A NAME="473"></A>and there left Caius Caninius Rebilus, the lieutenant, with the legions; 
<A NAME="474"></A>and went forward himself with the horse to view the Cornelian camp, because 
<A NAME="475"></A>that was reckoned a very eligible position for encamping. It is a straight 
<A NAME="476"></A>ridge, projecting into the sea, steep and rough on both sides, but the 
<A NAME="477"></A>ascent is more gentle on that part which lies opposite Utica. It is not 
<A NAME="478"></A>more than a mile distant from Utica in a direct line. But on this road 
<A NAME="479"></A>there is a spring, to which the sea comes up, and overflows; an extensive 
<A NAME="480"></A>morass is thereby formed; and if a person would avoid it, he must make 
<A NAME="481"></A>a circuit of six miles to reach the town.
<A NAME="482"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 25</B>
<A NAME="483"></A><BR><BR>Having examined this place, Curio got a view of Varus's camp, joining 
<A NAME="484"></A>the wall and town, at the gate called Bellica, well fortified by its natural 
<A NAME="485"></A>situation, on one side by the town itself, on the other by a theater which 
<A NAME="486"></A>is before the town, the approaches to the town being rendered difficult 
<A NAME="487"></A>and narrow by the very extensive out-buildings of that structure. At the 
<A NAME="488"></A>same time he observed the roads very full of carriages and cattle, which 
<A NAME="489"></A>they were conveying from the country into the town on the sudden alarm. 
<A NAME="490"></A>He sent his cavalry after them to plunder them and get the spoil. And at 
<A NAME="491"></A>the same time Varus had detached as a guard for them six hundred Numidian 
<A NAME="492"></A>horse, and four hundred foot, which king Juba had sent to Utica as auxiliaries 
<A NAME="493"></A>a few days before. There was a friendship subsisting between his [Juba's] 
<A NAME="494"></A>father and Pompey, and a feud between him and Curio, because he, when a 
<A NAME="495"></A>tribune of the people, had proposed a law, in which he endeavored to make 
<A NAME="496"></A>public property of the kingdom of Juba. The horse engaged; but the Numidians 
<A NAME="497"></A>were not able to stand our first charge; but a hundred and twenty being 
<A NAME="498"></A>killed, the rest retreated into their camp near the town. In the mean time, 
<A NAME="499"></A>on the arrival of his men of war, Curio ordered proclamation to be made 
<A NAME="500"></A>to the merchant ships, which lay at anchor before Utica, in number about 
<A NAME="501"></A>two hundred, that he would treat as enemies all that did not set sail immediately 
<A NAME="502"></A>for the Cornelian camp. As soon as the proclamation was made, in an instant 
<A NAME="503"></A>they all weighed anchor and left Utica, and repaired to the place commanded 
<A NAME="504"></A>them. This circumstance furnished the army with plenty of every 
<A NAME="505"></A>thing.
<A NAME="506"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 26</B>
<A NAME="507"></A><BR><BR>After these transactions, Curio returned to his camp to Bragada; 
<A NAME="508"></A>and by a general shout of the whole army was saluted imperator. The next 
<A NAME="509"></A>day he led his army to Utica, and encamped near the town. Before the works 
<A NAME="510"></A>of the camp were finished, the horse upon guard brought him word that a 
<A NAME="511"></A>large supply of horse and foot sent by king Juba were on their march to 
<A NAME="512"></A>Utica, and at the same time a cloud of dust was observed, and in a moment 
<A NAME="513"></A>the front of the line was in sight. Curio, surprised at the suddenness 
<A NAME="514"></A>of the affair, sent on the horse to receive their first charge, and detain 
<A NAME="515"></A>them. He immediately called off his legions from the work, and put them 
<A NAME="516"></A>in battle array. The horse began the battle: and before the legions could 
<A NAME="517"></A>be completely marshaled and take their ground, the king's entire forces 
<A NAME="518"></A>being thrown into disorder and confusion, because they had marched without 
<A NAME="519"></A>any order, and were under no apprehensions, betake themselves to flight: 
<A NAME="520"></A>almost all the enemy's horse being safe, because they made a speedy retreat 
<A NAME="521"></A>into the town along the shore, Caesar's soldiers slay a great number of 
<A NAME="522"></A>their infantry.
<A NAME="523"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 27</B>
<A NAME="524"></A><BR><BR>The next night two Marsian centurions with twenty-two men belonging 
<A NAME="525"></A>to the companies, deserted from Curio's camp to Attius Varus. They, whether 
<A NAME="526"></A>they uttered the sentiments which they really entertained, or wished to 
<A NAME="527"></A>gratify Varus (for what we wish we readily give credit to, and what we 
<A NAME="528"></A>think ourselves, we hope is the opinion of other men), assured him, that 
<A NAME="529"></A>the minds of the whole army were disaffected to Curio, that it was very 
<A NAME="530"></A>expedient that the armies should be brought in view of each other, and 
<A NAME="531"></A>an opportunity of a conference be given. Induced by their opinion, Varus 
<A NAME="532"></A>the next day led his troops out of the camp: Curio did so in like manner, 
<A NAME="533"></A>and with only one small valley between them, each drew up his 
<A NAME="534"></A>forces.
<A NAME="535"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 28</B>
<A NAME="536"></A><BR><BR>In Varus's army there was one Sextus Quintilius Varus who, as we 
<A NAME="537"></A>have mentioned before, was at Corfinium. When Caesar gave him his liberty, 
<A NAME="538"></A>he went over to Africa; now, Curio had transported to Africa those legions 
<A NAME="539"></A>which Caesar had received under his command a short time before at Corfinium; 
<A NAME="540"></A>so that the officers and companies were still the same, excepting the change 
<A NAME="541"></A>of a few centurions. Quintilius, making this a pretext for addressing them, 
<A NAME="542"></A>began to go round Curio's lines, and to entreat the soldiers "not to lose 
<A NAME="543"></A>all recollection of the oath which they took first to Domitius and to him 
<A NAME="544"></A>their quaestor, nor bear arms against those who had shared the same fortune, 
<A NAME="545"></A>and endured the same hardships in a siege, nor fight for those by whom 
<A NAME="546"></A>they had been opprobriously called deserters." To this he added a few words 
<A NAME="547"></A>by way of encouragement, what they might expect from his own liberality, 
<A NAME="548"></A>if they should follow him and Attius. On the delivery of this speech, no 
<A NAME="549"></A>intimation of their future conduct is given by Curio's army, and thus both 
<A NAME="550"></A>generals led back their troops to their camp.
<A NAME="551"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 29</B>
<A NAME="552"></A><BR><BR>However, a great and general fear spread through Curio's camp, 
<A NAME="553"></A>for it is soon increased by the various discourses of men. For every one 
<A NAME="554"></A>formed an opinion of his own; and to what he had heard from others, added 
<A NAME="555"></A>his own apprehensions. When this had spread from a single author to several 
<A NAME="556"></A>persons, and was handed from one another, there appeared to be many authors 
<A NAME="557"></A>for such sentiments as these: "That it was a civil war; that they were 
<A NAME="558"></A>men; and therefore that it was lawful for them to act freely, and follow 
<A NAME="559"></A>which party they pleased." These were the legions which a short time before 
<A NAME="560"></A>had belonged to the enemy; for the custom of offering free towns to those 
<A NAME="561"></A>who joined the opposite party had changed Caesar's kindness. For the harshest 
<A NAME="562"></A>expressions of the soldiers in general did not proceed from the Marsi and 
<A NAME="563"></A>Peligni, as those which passed in the tents the night before; and some 
<A NAME="564"></A>of their fellow soldiers heard them with displeasure. Some additions were 
<A NAME="565"></A>also made to them by those who wished to be thought more zealous in their 
<A NAME="566"></A>duty.
<A NAME="567"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 30</B>
<A NAME="568"></A><BR><BR>For these reasons, having called a council, Curio began to deliberate 
<A NAME="569"></A>on the general welfare. There were some opinions, which advised by all 
<A NAME="570"></A>means an attempt to be made, and an attack on Varus's camp; for when such 
<A NAME="571"></A>sentiments prevailed among the soldiers, they thought idleness was improper. 
<A NAME="572"></A>In short, they said "that it was better bravely to try the hazard of war 
<A NAME="573"></A>in a battle, than to be deserted and surrounded by their own troops, and 
<A NAME="574"></A>forced to submit to the greatest cruelties." There were some who gave their 
<A NAME="575"></A>opinion, that they ought to withdraw at the third watch to the Cornelian 
<A NAME="576"></A>camp; that by a longer interval of time the soldiers might be brought to 
<A NAME="577"></A>a proper way of thinking; and also, that if any misfortune should befall 
<A NAME="578"></A>them, they might have a safer and readier retreat to Sicily, from the great 
<A NAME="579"></A>number of their ships.
<A NAME="580"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 31</B>
<A NAME="581"></A><BR><BR>Curio, censuring both measures, said, "that the one was as deficient 
<A NAME="582"></A>in spirit, as the other exceeded in it: that the latter advised a shameful 
<A NAME="583"></A>flight, and the former recommended us to engage at a great disadvantage. 
<A NAME="584"></A>For on what, says he, can we rely that we can storm a camp, fortified both 
<A NAME="585"></A>by nature and art? Or, indeed, what advantage do we gain if we give over 
<A NAME="586"></A>the assault, after having suffered considerable loss; as if success did 
<A NAME="587"></A>not acquire for a general the affection of his army, and misfortune their 
<A NAME="588"></A>hatred? But what does a change of camp imply but a shameful flight and 
<A NAME="589"></A>universal despair, and the alienation of the army? For neither ought the 
<A NAME="590"></A>obedient to suspect that they are distrusted, nor the insolent to know 
<A NAME="591"></A>that we fear them; because our fears augment the licentiousness of the 
<A NAME="592"></A>latter, and diminish the zeal of the former. But if, says he, we were convinced 
<A NAME="593"></A>of the truth of the reports of the disaffection of the army (which I indeed 
<A NAME="594"></A>am confident are either altogether groundless, or at least less than they 
<A NAME="595"></A>are supposed to be), how much better to conceal and hide our suspicions 
<A NAME="596"></A>of it, than by our conduct confirm it? Ought not the defects of an army 
<A NAME="597"></A>to be as carefully concealed as the wounds in our bodies, lest we should 
<A NAME="598"></A>increase the enemy's hopes? but they moreover advise us to set out at midnight, 
<A NAME="599"></A>in order, I suppose, that those who attempt to do wrong may have a fairer 
<A NAME="600"></A>opportunity; for conduct of this kind is restrained either by shame or 
<A NAME="601"></A>fear, to the display of which the night is most averse. Wherefore, I am 
<A NAME="602"></A>neither so rash as to give my opinion that we ought to attack their camp 
<A NAME="603"></A>without hopes of succeeding; nor so influenced by fear as to despond: and 
<A NAME="604"></A>I imagine that every expedient ought first to be tried; and I am in a great 
<A NAME="605"></A>degree confident that I shall form the same opinions as yourselves on this 
<A NAME="606"></A>matter."
<A NAME="607"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 32</B>
<A NAME="608"></A><BR><BR>Having broken up the council, he called the soldiers together, 
<A NAME="609"></A>and reminded them "what advantage Caesar had derived from their zeal at 
<A NAME="610"></A>Corfinium; how by their good offices and influence he had brought over 
<A NAME="611"></A>a great part of Italy to his interest. For, says he, all the municipal 
<A NAME="612"></A>towns afterward imitated you and your conduct; nor was it without reason 
<A NAME="613"></A>that Caesar judged so favorably, and the enemy so harshly of you. For Pompey, 
<A NAME="614"></A>though beaten in no engagement, yet was obliged to shift his ground, and 
<A NAME="615"></A>leave Italy, from the precedent established by your conduct. Caesar commited 
<A NAME="616"></A>me, whom he considered his dearest friend, and the provinces of Sicily 
<A NAME="617"></A>and Africa, without which he was not able to protect Rome or Italy, to 
<A NAME="618"></A>your protection. There are some here present who encourage you to revolt 
<A NAME="619"></A>from us; for what can they wish for more, than at once to ruin us, and 
<A NAME="620"></A>to involve you in a heinous crime? or what baser opinions could they in 
<A NAME="621"></A>their resentment entertain of you, than that you would betray those who 
<A NAME="622"></A>acknowledged themselves indebted to you for every thing, and put yourselves 
<A NAME="623"></A>in the power of those who think they have been ruined by you? Have you 
<A NAME="624"></A>not heard of Caesar's exploits in Spain? that he routed two armies, conquered 
<A NAME="625"></A>two generals, recovered two provinces, and effected all this within forty 
<A NAME="626"></A>days after he came in sight of the enemy? Can those who were not able to 
<A NAME="627"></A>stand against him while they were uninjured, resist him when they are ruined? 
<A NAME="628"></A>Will you, who took part with Caesar while victory was uncertain, take part 
<A NAME="629"></A>with the conquered enemy when the fortune of the war is decided, and when 
<A NAME="630"></A>you ought to reap the reward of your services? For they say that they have 
<A NAME="631"></A>been deserted and betrayed by you, and remind you of a former oath. But 
<A NAME="632"></A>did you desert Lucius Domitius, or did Lucius Domitius desert you? Did 
<A NAME="633"></A>he not, when you were ready to submit to the greatest difficulties, cast 
<A NAME="634"></A>you off? Did he not, without your privacy, endeavor to effect his own escape? 
<A NAME="635"></A>When you were betrayed by him, were you not preserved by Caesar's generosity? 
<A NAME="636"></A>And how could he think you bound by your oath to him, when, after having 
<A NAME="637"></A>thrown up the ensigns of power, and abdicated his government, he became 
<A NAME="638"></A>a private person, and a captive in another's power? A new obligation is 
<A NAME="639"></A>left upon you, that you should disregard the oath, by which you are at 
<A NAME="640"></A>present bound; and have respect only to that which was invalidated by the 
<A NAME="641"></A>surrender of your general, and his diminution of rank. But I suppose, although 
<A NAME="642"></A>you are pleased with Caesar, you are offended with me; however, I shall 
<A NAME="643"></A>not boast of my services to you, which still are inferior to my own wishes 
<A NAME="644"></A>or your expectations. But, however, soldiers have ever looked for the rewards 
<A NAME="645"></A>of labor at the conclusion of a war; and what the issue of it is likely 
<A NAME="646"></A>to be, not even you can doubt. But why should I omit to mention my own 
<A NAME="647"></A>diligence and good fortune, and to what a happy crisis affairs are now 
<A NAME="648"></A>arrived? Are you sorry that I transported the army safe and entire, without 
<A NAME="649"></A>the loss of a single ship? That on my arrival, in the very first attack, 
<A NAME="650"></A>I routed the enemy's fleet? That twice in two days I defeated the enemy's 
<A NAME="651"></A>horse? That I carried out of the very harbor and bay two hundred of the 
<A NAME="652"></A>enemy's victualers, and reduced them to that situation that they can receive 
<A NAME="653"></A>no supplies either by land or sea? Will you divorce yourselves from this 
<A NAME="654"></A>fortune and these generals; and prefer the disgrace of Corfinium, the defeat 
<A NAME="655"></A>of Italy, the surrender of both Spains, and the prestige of the African 
<A NAME="656"></A>war? I, for my part, wished to be called a soldier of Caesar's; you honored 
<A NAME="657"></A>me with the title of Imperator. If you repent your bounty, I give it back 
<A NAME="658"></A>to you; restore to me my former name that you may not appear to have conferred 
<A NAME="659"></A>the honor on me as a reproach."
<A NAME="660"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 33</B>
<A NAME="661"></A><BR><BR>The soldiers, being affected by this oration, frequently attempted 
<A NAME="662"></A>to interrupt him while he was speaking, so that they appeared to bear with 
<A NAME="663"></A>excessive anguish the suspicion of treachery, and when he was leaving the 
<A NAME="664"></A>assembly they unanimously besought him to be of good spirits, and not hesitate 
<A NAME="665"></A>to engage the enemy and put their fidelity and courage to a trial. As the 
<A NAME="666"></A>wishes and opinions of all were changed by this act, Curio, with the general 
<A NAME="667"></A>consent, determined, whenever opportunity offered, to hazard a battle. 
<A NAME="668"></A>The next day he led out his forces and ranged them in order of battle on 
<A NAME="669"></A>the same ground where they had been posted the preceding day; nor did Attius 
<A NAME="670"></A>Varus hesitate to draw out his men, that, if any occasion should offer, 
<A NAME="671"></A>either to tamper with our men or to engage on equal terms he might not 
<A NAME="672"></A>miss the opportunity.
<A NAME="673"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 34</B>
<A NAME="674"></A><BR><BR>There lay between the two armies a valley, as already mentioned, 
<A NAME="675"></A>not very deep, but of a difficult and steep ascent. Each was waiting till 
<A NAME="676"></A>the enemy's forces should attempt to pass it, that they might engage with 
<A NAME="677"></A>the advantage of the ground. At the same time on the left wing, the entire 
<A NAME="678"></A>cavalry of Publius Attius, and several light-armed infantry intermixed 
<A NAME="679"></A>with them, were perceived descending into the valley. Against them Curio 
<A NAME="680"></A>detached his cavalry and two cohorts of the Marrucini, whose first charge 
<A NAME="681"></A>the enemy's horse were unable to stand, but, setting spurs to their horses, 
<A NAME="682"></A>fled back to their friends: the light-infantry being deserted by those 
<A NAME="683"></A>who had come out along with them, were surrounded and cut to pieces by 
<A NAME="684"></A>our men. Varus's whole army, facing that way, saw their men flee and cut 
<A NAME="685"></A>down. Upon which Rebilus, one of Caesar's lieutenants, whom Curio had brought 
<A NAME="686"></A>with him from Sicily knowing that he had great experience in military matters, 
<A NAME="687"></A>cried out, "You see the enemy are daunted, Curio! why do you hesitate to 
<A NAME="688"></A>take advantage of the opportunity?" Curio, having merely "expressed this, 
<A NAME="689"></A>that the soldiers should keep in mind the professions which they had made 
<A NAME="690"></A>to him the day before," then ordered them to follow him, and ran far before 
<A NAME="691"></A>them all. The valley was so difficult of assent that the foremost men could 
<A NAME="692"></A>not struggle up it unless assisted by those behind. But the minds of Attius's 
<A NAME="693"></A>soldiers being prepossessed with fear and the flight and slaughter of their 
<A NAME="694"></A>men, never thought of opposing us; and they all imagined that they were 
<A NAME="695"></A>already surrounded by our horse, and, therefore, before a dart could be 
<A NAME="696"></A>thrown, or our men come near them, Varus's whole army turned their backs 
<A NAME="697"></A>and retreated to their camp.
<A NAME="698"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 35</B>
<A NAME="699"></A><BR><BR>In this flight one Fabius, a Pelignian common soldier in Curio's 
<A NAME="700"></A>army, pursuing the enemy's rear, with a loud voice shouted to Varus by 
<A NAME="701"></A>his name, and often called him, so that he seemed to be one of his soldiers, 
<A NAME="702"></A>who wished to speak to him and give him advice. When Varus, after been 
<A NAME="703"></A>repeatedly called, stopped and looked at him, and inquired who he was and 
<A NAME="704"></A>what he wanted, he made a blow with his sword at his naked shoulder and 
<A NAME="705"></A>was very near killing Varus, but he escaped the danger by raising his shield 
<A NAME="706"></A>to ward off the blow. Fabius was surrounded by the soldiers near him and 
<A NAME="707"></A>cut to pieces; and by the multitude and crowds of those that fled, the 
<A NAME="708"></A>gates of the camps were thronged and the passage stopped, and a greater 
<A NAME="709"></A>number perished in that place without a stroke than in the battle and flight. 
<A NAME="710"></A>Nor were we far from driving them from this camp; and some of them ran 
<A NAME="711"></A>straightway to the town without halting. But both the nature of the ground 
<A NAME="712"></A>and the strength of the fortifications prevented our access to the camp; 
<A NAME="713"></A>for Curio's soldiers, marching out to battle, were without those things 
<A NAME="714"></A>which were requisite for storming a camp. Curio, therefore, led his army 
<A NAME="715"></A>back to the camp, with all his troops safe except Fabius. Of the enemy 
<A NAME="716"></A>about six hundred were killed and a thousand wounded, all of whom, after 
<A NAME="717"></A>Curio's return, and several more, under pretext of their wounds, but in 
<A NAME="718"></A>fact through fear, withdrew from the camp into the town, which Varus perceiving 
<A NAME="719"></A>and knowing the terror of his army, leaving a trumpeter in his camp and 
<A NAME="720"></A>a few tents for show, at the third watch led back his army quietly into 
<A NAME="721"></A>the town.
<A NAME="722"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 36</B>
<A NAME="723"></A><BR><BR>The next day Curio resolved to besiege Utica, and to draw lines 
<A NAME="724"></A>about it. In the town there was a multitude of people, ignorant of war, 
<A NAME="725"></A>owing to the length of the peace; some of them Uticans, very well inclined 
<A NAME="726"></A>to Caesar, for his favors to them; the Roman population was composed of 
<A NAME="727"></A>persons differing widely in their sentiments. The terror occasioned by 
<A NAME="728"></A>former battles was very great; and therefore, they openly talked of surrendering, 
<A NAME="729"></A>and argued with Attius that he should not suffer the fortune of them all 
<A NAME="730"></A>to be ruined by his obstinacy. While these things were in agitation, couriers, 
<A NAME="731"></A>who had been sent forward, arrived from king Juba, with the intelligence 
<A NAME="732"></A>that he was on his march, with considerable forces, and encouraged them 
<A NAME="733"></A>to protect and defend their city, a circumstance which greatly comforted 
<A NAME="734"></A>their desponding hearts.
<A NAME="735"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 37</B>
<A NAME="736"></A><BR><BR>The same intelligence was brought to Curio; but for some time he 
<A NAME="737"></A>could not give credit to it, because he had so great confidence in his 
<A NAME="738"></A>own good fortune. And at this time Caesar's success in Spain was announced 
<A NAME="739"></A>in Africa by messages and letters. Being elated by all these things, he 
<A NAME="740"></A>imagined that the king would not dare to attempt any thing against him. 
<A NAME="741"></A>But when he found out, from undoubted authority, that his forces were less 
<A NAME="742"></A>than twenty miles distant from Utica, abandoning his works, he retired 
<A NAME="743"></A>to the Cornelian camp. Here he began to lay in corn and wood, and to fortify 
<A NAME="744"></A>his camp, and immediately dispatched orders to Sicily, that his two legions 
<A NAME="745"></A>and the remainder of his cavalry should be sent to him. His camp was well 
<A NAME="746"></A>adapted for protracting a war, from the nature and strength of the situation, 
<A NAME="747"></A>from its proximity to the sea, and the abundance of water and salt, of 
<A NAME="748"></A>which a great quantity had been stored up from the neighboring salt-pits. 
<A NAME="749"></A>Timber could not fail him from the number of trees, nor corn, with which 
<A NAME="750"></A>the lands abounded. Wherefore, with the general consent, Curio determined 
<A NAME="751"></A>to wait for the rest of his forces, and protract the 
<A NAME="752"></A>war.
<A NAME="753"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 38</B>
<A NAME="754"></A><BR><BR>This plan being settled, and his conduct approved of, he is informed 
<A NAME="755"></A>by some deserters from the town that Juba had staid behind in his own kingdom, 
<A NAME="756"></A>being called home by a neighboring war, and a dispute with the people of 
<A NAME="757"></A>Leptis; and that Sabura, his commander-in-chief, who had been sent with 
<A NAME="758"></A>a small force, was drawing near to Utica. Curio rashly believing this information, 
<A NAME="759"></A>altered his design, and resolved to hazard a battle. His youth, his spirits, 
<A NAME="760"></A>his former good fortune and confidence of success, contributed much to 
<A NAME="761"></A>confirm this resolution. Induced by these motives, early in the night he 
<A NAME="762"></A>sent all his cavalry to the enemy's camp near the river Bagrada, of which 
<A NAME="763"></A>Sabura, of whom we have already spoken, was the commander. But the king 
<A NAME="764"></A>was coming after them with all his forces, and was posted at a distance 
<A NAME="765"></A>of six miles behind Sabura. The horse that were sent perform their march 
<A NAME="766"></A>that night, and attack the enemy unawares and unexpectedly; for the Numidians, 
<A NAME="767"></A>after the usual barbarous custom, encamped here and there without any regularity. 
<A NAME="768"></A>The cavalry having attacked them, when sunk in sleep and dispersed, killed 
<A NAME="769"></A>a great number of them; many were frightened and ran away. After which 
<A NAME="770"></A>the horse returned to Curio, and brought some, prisoners with 
<A NAME="771"></A>them.
<A NAME="772"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 39</B>
<A NAME="773"></A><BR><BR>Curio had set out at the fourth watch with all his forces, except 
<A NAME="774"></A>five cohorts which he left to guard the camp. Having advanced six miles, 
<A NAME="775"></A>he met the horse, heard what had happened and inquired from the captives 
<A NAME="776"></A>who commanded the camp at Bagrada. They replied Sabura. Through eagerness 
<A NAME="777"></A>to perform his journey, he neglected to make further inquiries, but looking 
<A NAME="778"></A>back to the company next him, "Don't you see, soldiers," says he, "that 
<A NAME="779"></A>the answer of the prisoners corresponds with the account of the deserters, 
<A NAME="780"></A>that the king is not with him, and that he sent only a small force which 
<A NAME="781"></A>was not able to withstand a few horse? Hasten then to spoil, to glory; 
<A NAME="782"></A>that we may now begin to think of rewarding you, and returning you thanks." 
<A NAME="783"></A>The achievements of the horse were great in themselves, especially if their 
<A NAME="784"></A>small number be compared with the vast host of Numidians. However, the 
<A NAME="785"></A>account was enlarged by themselves, as men are naturally inclined to boast 
<A NAME="786"></A>of their own merit. Besides, many spoils were produced; the men and horses 
<A NAME="787"></A>that were taken were brought into their sight, that they might imagine 
<A NAME="788"></A>that every moment of time which intervened was a delay to their conquest. 
<A NAME="789"></A>By this means the hope of Curio were seconded by the ardor of the soldiers. 
<A NAME="790"></A>He ordered the horse to follow him, and hastened his march, that he might 
<A NAME="791"></A>attack them as soon as possible, while in consternation after their flight. 
<A NAME="792"></A>But the horse, fatigued by the expedition of the preceding night, were 
<A NAME="793"></A>not able to keep up with him, but fell behind in different places. Even 
<A NAME="794"></A>this did not abate Curio's hopes.
<A NAME="795"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 40</B>
<A NAME="796"></A><BR><BR>Juba, being informed by Sabura of the battle in the night, sent 
<A NAME="797"></A>to his relief two thousand Spanish and Gallic horse, which he was accustomed 
<A NAME="798"></A>to keep near him to guard his person, and that part of his infantry on 
<A NAME="799"></A>which he had the greatest dependence, and he himself followed slowly after 
<A NAME="800"></A>with the rest of his forces and forty elephants, suspecting that as Curio 
<A NAME="801"></A>had sent his horse before, he himself would follow them. Sabura drew up 
<A NAME="802"></A>his army, both horse and foot, and commanded them to give way gradually 
<A NAME="803"></A>and retreat through the pretense of fear; that when it was necessary he 
<A NAME="804"></A>would give them the signal for battle, and such orders as he found circumstances 
<A NAME="805"></A>required. Curio, as his idea of their present behavior was calculated to 
<A NAME="806"></A>confirm his former hopes, imagined that the enemy were running away, and 
<A NAME="807"></A>led his army from the rising grounds down to the plain.
<A NAME="808"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 41</B>
<A NAME="809"></A><BR><BR>And when he had advanced from this place about sixteen miles, his 
<A NAME="810"></A>army being exhausted with the fatigue, he halted. Sabura gave his men the 
<A NAME="811"></A>signal, marshaled his army, and began to go around his ranks and encourage 
<A NAME="812"></A>them. But he made use of the foot only for show; and sent the horse to 
<A NAME="813"></A>the charge: Curio was not deficient in skill, and encouraged his men to 
<A NAME="814"></A>rest all their hopes in their valor. Neither were the soldiers, though 
<A NAME="815"></A>wearied, nor the horse, though few and exhausted with fatigue, deficient 
<A NAME="816"></A>in ardor to engage, and courage: but the latter were in number but two 
<A NAME="817"></A>hundred: the rest had dropped behind on the march. Wherever they charged 
<A NAME="818"></A>they forced the enemy to give ground, but they were not able to pursue 
<A NAME="819"></A>them far when they fled, or to press their horses too severely. Besides, 
<A NAME="820"></A>the enemy's cavalry began to surround us on both wings and to trample down 
<A NAME="821"></A>our rear. When any cohorts ran forward out of the line, the Numidians, 
<A NAME="822"></A>being fresh, by their speed avoided our charge, and surrounded ours when 
<A NAME="823"></A>they attempted to return to their post, and cut them off from the main 
<A NAME="824"></A>body. So that it did not appear safe either to keep their ground and maintain 
<A NAME="825"></A>their ranks, or to issue from the line, and run the risk. The enemy's troops 
<A NAME="826"></A>were frequently reinforced by assistance sent from Juba; strength began 
<A NAME="827"></A>to fail our men through fatigue; and those who had been wounded could neither 
<A NAME="828"></A>quit the field nor retire to a place of safety, because the whole field 
<A NAME="829"></A>was surrounded by the enemy's cavalry. Therefore, despairing of their own 
<A NAME="830"></A>safety, as men usually do in the last moment of their lives, they either 
<A NAME="831"></A>lamented their unhappy deaths, or recommended their parents to the survivors, 
<A NAME="832"></A>if fortune should save any from the impending danger. All were full of 
<A NAME="833"></A>fear and grief.
<A NAME="834"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 42</B>
<A NAME="835"></A><BR><BR>When Curio perceived that in the general consternation neither 
<A NAME="836"></A>his exhortations nor entreaties were attended to, imagining that the only 
<A NAME="837"></A>hope of escaping in their deplorable situation was to gain the nearest 
<A NAME="838"></A>hills, he ordered the colors to be borne that way. But a party of horse, 
<A NAME="839"></A>that had been sent by Sabura, had already got possession of them. Now indeed 
<A NAME="840"></A>our men were reduced to extreme despair: and some of them were killed by 
<A NAME="841"></A>the cavalry in attempting to escape: some fell to the ground unhurt. Cneius 
<A NAME="842"></A>Domitius, commander of the cavalry, standing round Curio with a small party 
<A NAME="843"></A>of horse, urged Curio to endeavor to escape by flight, and to hasten to 
<A NAME="844"></A>his camp; and assured him that he would not forsake him. But Curio declared 
<A NAME="845"></A>that he would never more appear in Caesar's sight, after losing the army 
<A NAME="846"></A>which had been committed by Caesar, to his charge, and accordingly fought 
<A NAME="847"></A>till he was killed. Very few of the horse escaped from that battle, but 
<A NAME="848"></A>those who had staid behind to refresh their horses having perceived at 
<A NAME="849"></A>a distance the defeat of the whole army, retired in safety to their 
<A NAME="850"></A>camp.
<A NAME="851"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 43</B>
<A NAME="852"></A><BR><BR>The soldiers were all killed to a man. Marcus Rufus, the quaestor, 
<A NAME="853"></A>who was left behind in the camp by Curio, having got intelligence of these 
<A NAME="854"></A>things, encouraged his men not to be disheartened. They beg and entreat 
<A NAME="855"></A>to be transported to Sicily. He consented, and ordered the masters of the 
<A NAME="856"></A>ships to have all the boats brought close to the shore early in the evening. 
<A NAME="857"></A>But so great was the terror in general, that some said that Juba's forces 
<A NAME="858"></A>were marching up, others that Varus was hastening with his legions, and 
<A NAME="859"></A>that they already saw the dust raised by their coming; of which not one 
<A NAME="860"></A>circumstance had happened: others suspected that the enemy's fleet would 
<A NAME="861"></A>immediately be upon them. Therefore in the general consternation, every 
<A NAME="862"></A>man consulted his own safety. Those who were on board of the fleet, were 
<A NAME="863"></A>in a hurry to set sail, and their flight hastened the masters of the ships 
<A NAME="864"></A>of burden. A few small fishing boats attended their duty and his orders. 
<A NAME="865"></A>But as the shores were crowded, so great was the struggle to determine 
<A NAME="866"></A>who of such a vast number should first get on board, that some of the vessels 
<A NAME="867"></A>sank with the weight of the multitude, and the fears of the rest delayed 
<A NAME="868"></A>them from coming to the shore.
<A NAME="869"></A><BR><BR><B>Chapter 44</B>
<A NAME="870"></A><BR><BR>From which circumstances it happened that a few foot and aged men, 
<A NAME="871"></A>that could prevail either through interest or pity, or who were able to 
<A NAME="872"></A>swim to the ships, were taken on board, and landed safe in Sicily. The 
<A NAME="873"></A>rest of the troops sent their centurions as deputies to Varus at night, 
<A NAME="874"></A>and surrendered themselves to him. But Juba the next day having spied their 
<A NAME="875"></A>cohorts before the town, claimed them as his booty, and ordered great part 
<A NAME="876"></A>of them to be put to the sword; a few he selected and sent home to his 
<A NAME="877"></A>own realm. Although Varus complained that his honor was insulted by Juba, 
<A NAME="878"></A>yet he dare not oppose him: Juba rode on horseback into the town, attended 
<A NAME="879"></A>by several senators, among whom were Servius Sulpicius and Licinius Damasippus, 
<A NAME="880"></A>and in a few days arranged and ordered what he would have done in Utica, 
<A NAME="881"></A>and in a few days more returned to his own kingdom, with all his 
<A NAME="882"></A>forces.
