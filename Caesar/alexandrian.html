<BR><A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A>Chapter 1
<A NAME="11"></A><BR><BR>When the war broke out at Alexandria, Caesar sent to Rhodes, Syria, 
<A NAME="12"></A>and Cilicia, for all his fleet; and summoned archers from Crete, and cavalry 
<A NAME="13"></A>from Malchus, king of the Nabatheans. He likewise ordered military engines 
<A NAME="14"></A>to be provided, corn to be brought, and forces dispatched to him. Meanwhile 
<A NAME="15"></A>he daily strengthened his fortifications by new works; and such parts of 
<A NAME="16"></A>the town as appeared less tenable were strengthened with testudos and mantelets. 
<A NAME="17"></A>Openings were made in the walls, through which the battering-rams might 
<A NAME="18"></A>play; and the fortifications were extended over whatever space was covered 
<A NAME="19"></A>with ruins, or taken by force. For Alexandria is in a manner secure from 
<A NAME="20"></A>fire, because the houses are all built without joists or wood, and are 
<A NAME="21"></A>all vaulted, and roofed with tile or pavement. Caesar's principal aim was, 
<A NAME="22"></A>to inclose with works the smallest part of the town, separated from the 
<A NAME="23"></A>rest by a morass toward the south: with these views, first, that as the 
<A NAME="24"></A>city was divided into two parts, the army should be commanded by one general 
<A NAME="25"></A>and one council; in the second place, that he might be able to succor his 
<A NAME="26"></A>troops when hard pressed, and carry aid from the other part of the city. 
<A NAME="27"></A>Above all, he by this means made sure of water end forage, as he was but 
<A NAME="28"></A>ill provided with the one, and wholly destitute of the other. The morass, 
<A NAME="29"></A>on the contrary, served abundantly to supply him with 
<A NAME="30"></A>both.
<A NAME="31"></A><BR><BR>Chapter 2
<A NAME="32"></A><BR><BR>Nor were the Alexandrians remiss on their side, or less active 
<A NAME="33"></A>in the conduct of their affairs. For they had sent deputies and commissioners 
<A NAME="34"></A>into all parts, where the powers and territories of Egypt extend, to levy 
<A NAME="35"></A>troops. They had carried vast quantities of darts and engines into the 
<A NAME="36"></A>town, and drawn together an innumerable multitude of soldiers. Nevertheless 
<A NAME="37"></A>workshops were established in every part of the city, for the making of 
<A NAME="38"></A>arms. They enlisted all the slaves that were of age; and the richer citizens 
<A NAME="39"></A>supplied them with food and pay. By a judicious disposition of this multitude, 
<A NAME="40"></A>they guarded the fortifications in the remoter parts of the town; while 
<A NAME="41"></A>they quartered the veteran cohorts, which were exempted from all other 
<A NAME="42"></A>service, in the squares and open places; that on whatever side an attack 
<A NAME="43"></A>should be made, they might be at hand to give relief, and march fresh to 
<A NAME="44"></A>the charge. They shut up all the avenues and passes by a triple wall built 
<A NAME="45"></A>of square stones, and carried to the height of forty feet. They defended 
<A NAME="46"></A>the lower parts of the town by very high towers of ten stories: besides 
<A NAME="47"></A>which, they had likewise contrived a kind of moving towers, which consisted 
<A NAME="48"></A>of the same number of stories, and which being fitted with ropes and wheels, 
<A NAME="49"></A>could, by means of horses, as the streets of Alexandria were quite even 
<A NAME="50"></A>and level, be conveyed wherever their service was necessary.
<A NAME="51"></A><BR><BR>Chapter 3
<A NAME="52"></A><BR><BR>The city abounding in every thing, and being very rich, furnished 
<A NAME="53"></A>ample materials for these several works: and as the people were extremely 
<A NAME="54"></A>ingenious, and quick of apprehension, they so well copied what they saw 
<A NAME="55"></A>done by us that our men seemed rather to imitate their works. They even 
<A NAME="56"></A>invented many things themselves, and attacked our works, at the same time 
<A NAME="57"></A>that they defended their own. Their chiefs every where represented: "That 
<A NAME="58"></A>the people of Rome were endeavoring by degrees to assume the possession 
<A NAME="59"></A>of Egypt; that a few years before Gabinius had come thither with an army; 
<A NAME="60"></A>that Pompey had retreated to the same place in his flight; that Caesar 
<A NAME="61"></A>was now among them with a considerable body of troops, nor had they gained 
<A NAME="62"></A>any thing by Pompey's death; that Caesar should not prolong his stay; that 
<A NAME="63"></A>if they did not find means to expel him, the kingdom would be reduced to 
<A NAME="64"></A>a Roman province: and that they ought to do it at once, for he, blockaded 
<A NAME="65"></A>by the storms on account of the season of the year, could receive no supplies 
<A NAME="66"></A>from beyond the sea."
<A NAME="67"></A><BR><BR>Chapter 4
<A NAME="68"></A><BR><BR>Meanwhile, a division arising between Achillas, who commanded the 
<A NAME="69"></A>veteran army, and Arsinoe, the youngest daughter of king Ptolemy, as has 
<A NAME="70"></A>been mentioned above, while they mutually endeavored to supplant one another, 
<A NAME="71"></A>each striving to engross the supreme authority, Arsinoe, by the assistance 
<A NAME="72"></A>of the eunuch Ganymed, her governor, at length prevailed, and slew Achillas. 
<A NAME="73"></A>After his death, she possessed the whole power without a rival, and raised 
<A NAME="74"></A>Ganymed to the command of the army; who, on his entrance upon that high 
<A NAME="75"></A>office, augmented the largesses of the troops, and with equal diligence 
<A NAME="76"></A>discharged all other parts of his duty.
<A NAME="77"></A><BR><BR>Chapter 5
<A NAME="78"></A><BR><BR>Alexandria is almost quite hollow underneath, occasioned by the 
<A NAME="79"></A>many aqueducts to the Nile, that furnish the private houses with water; 
<A NAME="80"></A>where being received in cisterns, it settles by degrees, and becomes perfectly 
<A NAME="81"></A>clear. The master and his family are accustomed to use this: for the water 
<A NAME="82"></A>of the Nile being extremely thick and muddy, is apt to breed many distempers. 
<A NAME="83"></A>The common people, however, are forced to be contented with the latter, 
<A NAME="84"></A>because there is not a single spring in the whole city. The river was in 
<A NAME="85"></A>that part of the town which was in the possession of the Alexandrians. 
<A NAME="86"></A>By which circumstance Ganymed was reminded that our men might be deprived 
<A NAME="87"></A>of water; because being distributed into several streets, for the more 
<A NAME="88"></A>easy defense of the works, they made use of that which was preserved in 
<A NAME="89"></A>the aqueducts and the cisterns of private houses.
<A NAME="90"></A><BR><BR>Chapter 6
<A NAME="91"></A><BR><BR>With this view he began a great and difficult work; for having 
<A NAME="92"></A>stopped up all the canals by which his own cisterns were supplied, he drew 
<A NAME="93"></A>vast quantities of water out of the sea, by the help of wheels and other 
<A NAME="94"></A>engines, pouring it continually into the canals of Caesar's quarter. The 
<A NAME="95"></A>cisterns in the nearest houses soon began to taste salter than ordinary, 
<A NAME="96"></A>and occasioned great wonder among the men, who could not think from what 
<A NAME="97"></A>cause it proceeded. They were even ready to disbelieve their senses when 
<A NAME="98"></A>those who were quartered a little lower in the town assured them that they 
<A NAME="99"></A>found the water the same as before. This put them upon comparing the cisterns 
<A NAME="100"></A>one with another, and by trial they easily perceived the difference. But 
<A NAME="101"></A>in a little time the water in the nearest houses became quite unfit for 
<A NAME="102"></A>use, and that lower down grew daily more tainted and 
<A NAME="103"></A>brackish.
<A NAME="104"></A><BR><BR>Chapter 7
<A NAME="105"></A><BR><BR>All doubt being removed by this circumstance, such a terror ensued 
<A NAME="106"></A>among the troops that they fancied themselves reduced to the last extremity. 
<A NAME="107"></A>Some complained of Caesar's delay, that he did not order them immediately 
<A NAME="108"></A>to repair to their ships. Others dreaded a yet greater misfortune, as it 
<A NAME="109"></A>would be impossible to conceal their design of retreating from the Alexandrians, 
<A NAME="110"></A>who were so near them; and no less so to embark in the face of a vigorous 
<A NAME="111"></A>and pursuing enemy. There were besides a great number of the townsmen in 
<A NAME="112"></A>Caesar's quarter, whom he had not thought proper to force from their houses, 
<A NAME="113"></A>because they openly pretended to be in his interest, and to have quitted 
<A NAME="114"></A>the party of their follow-citizens. But to offer here a defense either 
<A NAME="115"></A>of the sincerity or conduct of these Alexandrians, would be only labor 
<A NAME="116"></A>in vain, since all who know the genius and temper of the people must be 
<A NAME="117"></A>satisfied that they are the fittest instruments in the world for 
<A NAME="118"></A>treason.
<A NAME="119"></A><BR><BR>Chapter 8
<A NAME="120"></A><BR><BR>Caesar labored to remove his soldiers' fears by encouraging and 
<A NAME="121"></A>reasoning with them. For he affirmed "that they might easily find fresh 
<A NAME="122"></A>water by digging wells, as all sea coasts naturally abounded with fresh 
<A NAME="123"></A>springs: that if Egypt was singular in this respect, and differed from 
<A NAME="124"></A>every other soil, yet still, as the sea was open, and the enemy without 
<A NAME="125"></A>a fleet, there was nothing to hinder their fetching it at pleasure in their 
<A NAME="126"></A>ships, either from Paraetonium on the left, or from the island on the right; 
<A NAME="127"></A>and as their two voyages were in different directions, they could not be 
<A NAME="128"></A>prevented by adverse winds at the same time; that a retreat was on no account 
<A NAME="129"></A>to be thought of, not only by those that had a concern for their honor, 
<A NAME="130"></A>but even by such as regarded nothing but life; that it was with the utmost 
<A NAME="131"></A>difficulty they could defend themselves behind their works; but if they 
<A NAME="132"></A>once quitted that advantage, neither in number or situation would they 
<A NAME="133"></A>be a match for the enemy: that to embark would require much time, and be 
<A NAME="134"></A>attended with great danger, especially where it must be managed by little 
<A NAME="135"></A>boats: that the Alexandrians, on the contrary, were nimble and active, 
<A NAME="136"></A>and thoroughly acquainted with the streets and buildings; that, moreover, 
<A NAME="137"></A>when flushed with victory, they would not fail to run before, seize all 
<A NAME="138"></A>the advantageous posts, possess themselves of the tops of the houses, and 
<A NAME="139"></A>by annoying them in their retreat, effectually prevent their getting on 
<A NAME="140"></A>board; that they must therefore think no more of retreating, but place 
<A NAME="141"></A>all their hopes of safety in victory."
<A NAME="142"></A><BR><BR>Chapter 9
<A NAME="143"></A><BR><BR>Having by this speech re-assured his men, he ordered the centurions 
<A NAME="144"></A>to lay aside all other works, and apply themselves day and night to the 
<A NAME="145"></A>digging of wells. The work once begun, and the minds of all aroused to 
<A NAME="146"></A>exertion, they exerted themselves so vigorously that in the very first 
<A NAME="147"></A>night abundance of fresh water was found. Thus, with no great labor on 
<A NAME="148"></A>our side, the mighty projects and painful attempts of the Alexandrians 
<A NAME="149"></A>were entirely frustrated. Within these two days the thirty-seventh legion, 
<A NAME="150"></A>composed of Pompey's veterans that had surrendered to Caesar, embarking 
<A NAME="151"></A>by order of Domitius Calvinus, with arms, darts, provisions, and military 
<A NAME="152"></A>engines, arrived upon the coast of Africa, a little above Alexandria. These 
<A NAME="153"></A>ships were hindered from gaining the port by an easterly wind, which continued 
<A NAME="154"></A>to blow for several days; but all along that coast it is very safe to ride 
<A NAME="155"></A>at anchor. Being detained, however, longer than they expected, and distressed 
<A NAME="156"></A>by want of water, they gave notice of it to Caesar, by a dispatch 
<A NAME="157"></A>sloop.
<A NAME="158"></A><BR><BR>Chapter 10
<A NAME="159"></A><BR><BR>Caesar, that he might himself be able to determine what was best 
<A NAME="160"></A>to be done, went on board one of the ships in the harbor, and ordered the 
<A NAME="161"></A>whole fleet to follow. He took none of the land forces with him, because 
<A NAME="162"></A>he was unwilling to leave the works unguarded during his absence. Being 
<A NAME="163"></A>arrived at that part of the coast known by the name of Chersonesus, he 
<A NAME="164"></A>sent some mariners on shore to fetch water. Some of these venturing too 
<A NAME="165"></A>far into the country for the sake of plunder, were intercepted by the enemy's 
<A NAME="166"></A>horse. From them the Egyptians learned that Caesar himself was on board, 
<A NAME="167"></A>without any soldiers. Upon this information, they thought fortune had thrown 
<A NAME="168"></A>in their way a good opportunity of attempting something with success. They 
<A NAME="169"></A>therefore manned all the ships that they had ready for sea, and met Caesar 
<A NAME="170"></A>on his return. He declined fighting that day, for two reasons, first, because 
<A NAME="171"></A>he had no soldiers on board, and secondly, because it was past four in 
<A NAME="172"></A>the afternoon. The night, he was sensible, must be highly advantageous 
<A NAME="173"></A>to his enemies, who depended on their knowledge of the coast, while he 
<A NAME="174"></A>would be deprived of the benefit of encouraging his men, which could not 
<A NAME="175"></A>be done with any effect in the dark, where courage and cowardice must remain 
<A NAME="176"></A>equally unknown. Caesar, therefore, drew all his ships toward the shore, 
<A NAME="177"></A>where he imagined the enemy would not follow him.
<A NAME="178"></A><BR><BR>Chapter 11
<A NAME="179"></A><BR><BR>There was one Rhodian galley in Caesar's right wing, considerably 
<A NAME="180"></A>distant from the rest. The enemy observing this, could not restrain themselves, 
<A NAME="181"></A>but came forward with four-decked ships, and several open barks, to attack 
<A NAME="182"></A>her. Caesar was obliged to advance to her relief, that he might not suffer 
<A NAME="183"></A>the disgrace of seeing one of his galleys sunk before his eyes though, 
<A NAME="184"></A>had he left her to perish, he judged that she deserved it for her rashness. 
<A NAME="185"></A>The attack was sustained with great courage by the Rhodians, who, though 
<A NAME="186"></A>at all times distinguished by their valor and experience in engagements 
<A NAME="187"></A>at sea yet exerted themselves in a particular manner on this occasion, 
<A NAME="188"></A>that they might not draw upon themselves the charge of having occasioned 
<A NAME="189"></A>a misfortune to the fleet. Accordingly they obtained a complete victory, 
<A NAME="190"></A>took one four-banked galley, sunk another, disabled a third, and slew all 
<A NAME="191"></A>that were on board, besides a great number of the combatants belonging 
<A NAME="192"></A>to the other ships. Nay, had not night interposed, Caesar would have made 
<A NAME="193"></A>himself master of their whole fleet. During the consternation that followed 
<A NAME="194"></A>upon this defeat, Caesar, finding the contrary winds to abate, took the 
<A NAME="195"></A>transports in tow, and advanced with the victorious fleet to 
<A NAME="196"></A>Alexandria.
<A NAME="197"></A><BR><BR>Chapter 12
<A NAME="198"></A><BR><BR>The Alexandrians, disheartened at this loss, since they found themselves 
<A NAME="199"></A>now worsted, not by the superior valor of the soldiers, but by the skill 
<A NAME="200"></A>and ability of the mariners, retired to the tops of their houses, and blocked 
<A NAME="201"></A>up the entrances of their streets, as if they feared our fleet might attack 
<A NAME="202"></A>them even by land. But soon after, Ganymed assuring them in council, that 
<A NAME="203"></A>he would not only restore the vessels they had lost, but even increase 
<A NAME="204"></A>their number, they began to repair their old ships with great expectation 
<A NAME="205"></A>and confidence, and resolved to apply more than ever to the putting their 
<A NAME="206"></A>fleet in a good condition. And although they had lost above a hundred and 
<A NAME="207"></A>ten ships in the port and arsenal, yet they did not relinquish the idea 
<A NAME="208"></A>of repairing their fleet; because, by making themselves masters of the 
<A NAME="209"></A>sea, they saw they would have it in their power to hinder Caesar's receiving 
<A NAME="210"></A>any reinforcements or supplies. Besides, being mariners, born upon the 
<A NAME="211"></A>sea-coast, and exercised from their infancy in naval affairs, they were 
<A NAME="212"></A>desirous to return to that wherein their true and proper strength lay, 
<A NAME="213"></A>remembering the advantages they had formerly gained, even with their little 
<A NAME="214"></A>ships. They therefore applied themselves with all diligence to the equipping 
<A NAME="215"></A>a fleet.
<A NAME="216"></A><BR><BR>Chapter 13
<A NAME="217"></A><BR><BR>Vessels were stationed at all the mouths of the Nile; for receiving 
<A NAME="218"></A>and gathering in the customs. Several old ships were likewise lodged in 
<A NAME="219"></A>the king's private arsenals which had not put to sea for many years. These 
<A NAME="220"></A>last they refitted, and recalled the former to Alexandria. Oars were wanting; 
<A NAME="221"></A>they uncovered the porticos, academies, and public buildings, and made 
<A NAME="222"></A>use of the planks they furnished for oars. Their natural ingenuity, and 
<A NAME="223"></A>the abundance of all things to be met with in the city, supplied every 
<A NAME="224"></A>want. In fine, they had no long navigation to provide for, and were only 
<A NAME="225"></A>solicitous about present exigences, foreseeing they would have no occasion 
<A NAME="226"></A>to fight but in the port. In a few days, therefore, contrary to all expectation, 
<A NAME="227"></A>they had fitted out twenty-two quadriremes, and five quinqueremes. To these 
<A NAME="228"></A>they added a great number of small open barks; and after testing the efficiency 
<A NAME="229"></A>of each in the harbor, put a sufficient number of soldiers on board, and 
<A NAME="230"></A>prepared every thing necessary for an engagement. Caesar had nine Rhodian 
<A NAME="231"></A>galleys (for of the ten which were sent, one was shipwrecked on the coast 
<A NAME="232"></A>of Egypt), eight from Pontus, five from Lycia, and twelve from Asia. Of 
<A NAME="233"></A>these, ten were quadriremes, and five quinqueremes; the rest were smaller, 
<A NAME="234"></A>and for the most part without decks. Yet, trusting to the valor of his 
<A NAME="235"></A>soldiers, and being acquainted with the strength of the enemy, he prepared 
<A NAME="236"></A>for an engagement.
<A NAME="237"></A><BR><BR>Chapter 14
<A NAME="238"></A><BR><BR>When both sides were come to have sufficient confidence in their 
<A NAME="239"></A>own strength, Caesar sailed round Pharos, and formed in line of battle 
<A NAME="240"></A>opposite to the enemy. He placed the Rhodian galleys on his right wing, 
<A NAME="241"></A>and those of Pontus on his left. Between these he left a space of four 
<A NAME="242"></A>hundred paces, to allow for extending and working the vessels. This disposition 
<A NAME="243"></A>being made, he drew up the rest of the fleet as a reserve, giving them 
<A NAME="244"></A>the necessary orders, and distributing them in such a manner that every 
<A NAME="245"></A>ship followed that to which she was appointed to give succor. The Alexandrians 
<A NAME="246"></A>brought out their fleet with great confidence, and drew it up, placing 
<A NAME="247"></A>their twenty-two quadriremes in front, and disposing the rest behind them 
<A NAME="248"></A>in a second line, by way of reserve. They had besides a great number of 
<A NAME="249"></A>boats and smaller vessels, which carried fire and combustibles, with the 
<A NAME="250"></A>intention of intimidating us by their number, cries, and flaming darts. 
<A NAME="251"></A>Between the two fleets were certain flats, separated by very narrow channels, 
<A NAME="252"></A>and which are said to be on the African coast, as being in that division 
<A NAME="253"></A>of Alexandria which belongs to Africa. Both sides waited which should first 
<A NAME="254"></A>pass these shallows, because whoever entered the narrow channels between 
<A NAME="255"></A>them, in case of any misfortune, would be impeded both in retreating and 
<A NAME="256"></A>working their ships to advantage.
<A NAME="257"></A><BR><BR>Chapter 15
<A NAME="258"></A><BR><BR>Euphranor commanded the Rhodian fleet, who for valor and greatness 
<A NAME="259"></A>of mind deserved to be ranked among our own men rather than the Grecians. 
<A NAME="260"></A>The Rhodians had raised him to the post of admiral, on account of his known 
<A NAME="261"></A>courage and experience. He, perceiving Caesar's design, addressed him to 
<A NAME="262"></A>this effect: "You seem afraid of passing the shallow first, lest you should 
<A NAME="263"></A>be thereby forced to come to an engagement, before you can bring up the 
<A NAME="264"></A>rest of the fleet. Leave the matter to us; we will sustain the fight (and 
<A NAME="265"></A>we will not disappoint your expectations), until the whole fleet gets clear 
<A NAME="266"></A>of the shallows. It is both dishonorable and afflicting that they should 
<A NAME="267"></A>so long continue in our sight with an air of triumph." Caesar, encouraging 
<A NAME="268"></A>him in his design, and bestowing many praises upon him, gave the signal 
<A NAME="269"></A>for engaging. Four Rhodian ships having passed the shallows, the Alexandrians 
<A NAME="270"></A>gathered round and attacked them. They maintained the fight with great 
<A NAME="271"></A>courage, disengaging themselves by their art and address, and working their 
<A NAME="272"></A>ships with so much skill, that notwithstanding the inequality of number, 
<A NAME="273"></A>none of the enemy were suffered to run alongside, or break their oars. 
<A NAME="274"></A>Meantime the rest of the fleet came up; when, on account of the narrowness 
<A NAME="275"></A>of the place, art became useless, and the contest depended entirely upon 
<A NAME="276"></A>valor. Nor was there at Alexandria a single Roman or citizen who remained 
<A NAME="277"></A>engaged in the attack or defense, but mounted the tops of the houses and 
<A NAME="278"></A>all the eminences that would give a view of the fight, addressing the gods 
<A NAME="279"></A>by vows and prayers for victory.
<A NAME="280"></A><BR><BR>Chapter 16
<A NAME="281"></A><BR><BR>The event of the battle was by no means equal; a defeat would have 
<A NAME="282"></A>deprived us of all resources either by land or sea; and even if we were 
<A NAME="283"></A>victorious, the future would be uncertain. The Alexandrians, on the contrary, 
<A NAME="284"></A>by a victory gained every thing; and if defeated, might yet again have 
<A NAME="285"></A>recourse to fortune. It was likewise a matter of the highest concern to 
<A NAME="286"></A>see the safety of all depend upon a few, of whom, if any were deficient 
<A NAME="287"></A>in resolution and energy, they would expose their whole party to destruction. 
<A NAME="288"></A>This Caesar had often represented to his troops during the preceding days, 
<A NAME="289"></A>that they might be thereby induced to fight with the more resolution, when 
<A NAME="290"></A>they knew the common safety to depend upon their bravery. Every man said 
<A NAME="291"></A>the same to his comrade, companion, and friend, beseeching him not to disappoint 
<A NAME="292"></A>the expectation of those who had chosen him in preference to others for 
<A NAME="293"></A>the defense of the common interest. Accordingly, they fought with so much 
<A NAME="294"></A>resolution, that neither the art nor address of the Egyptians, a maritime 
<A NAME="295"></A>and seafaring people, could avail them, nor the multitude of their ships 
<A NAME="296"></A>be of service to them; nor the valor of those selected for this engagement 
<A NAME="297"></A>be compared to the determined courage of the Romans. In this action a quinquereme 
<A NAME="298"></A>was taken, and a bireme, with all the soldiers and mariners on board, besides 
<A NAME="299"></A>three sunk, without any loss on our side. The rest fled toward the town, 
<A NAME="300"></A>and protecting their ships under the mole and forts, prevented us from 
<A NAME="301"></A>approaching.
<A NAME="302"></A><BR><BR>Chapter 17
<A NAME="303"></A><BR><BR>To deprive the enemy of this resource for the future, Caesar thought 
<A NAME="304"></A>it by all means necessary to render himself master of the mole and island; 
<A NAME="305"></A>for having already in a great measure completed his works within the town, 
<A NAME="306"></A>he was in hopes of being able to defend himself both in the island and 
<A NAME="307"></A>city. This resolution being taken, he put into boats and small vessels 
<A NAME="308"></A>ten cohorts, a select body of light-armed infantry, and such of the Gallic 
<A NAME="309"></A>cavalry as he thought fittest for his purpose, and sent them against the 
<A NAME="310"></A>island; while, at the same time, to create a diversion, he attacked it 
<A NAME="311"></A>on the other with his fleet, promising great rewards to those who should 
<A NAME="312"></A>first render themselves masters of it. At first, the enemy firmly withstood 
<A NAME="313"></A>the impetuosity of our men; for they both annoyed them from the tops of 
<A NAME="314"></A>the houses, and gallantly maintained their ground along the shore; to which 
<A NAME="315"></A>being steep and craggy, our men could find no way of approach; the more 
<A NAME="316"></A>accessible avenues being skillfully defended by small boats, and five galleys, 
<A NAME="317"></A>prudently stationed for that purpose. But when after examining the approaches, 
<A NAME="318"></A>and sounding the shallows, a few of our men got a footing upon the shore, 
<A NAME="319"></A>and were followed by others, who pushed the islanders, without intermission; 
<A NAME="320"></A>the Pharians at last betook themselves to flight. On their defeat, the 
<A NAME="321"></A>rest abandoning the defense of the port, quitted their ships, and retired 
<A NAME="322"></A>into the town, to provide for the security of their 
<A NAME="323"></A>houses
<A NAME="324"></A><BR><BR>Chapter 18
<A NAME="325"></A><BR><BR>But they could not long maintain their ground there: though, to 
<A NAME="326"></A>compare small things with great, their buildings were not unlike those 
<A NAME="327"></A>of Alexandria, and their towers were high, and joined together so as to 
<A NAME="328"></A>form a kind of wall; and our men had not come prepared with ladders, fascines, 
<A NAME="329"></A>or any weapons for assault. But fear often deprives men of intellect and 
<A NAME="330"></A>counsel, and weakens their strength, as happened upon this occasion. Those 
<A NAME="331"></A>who had ventured to oppose us on even ground, terrified by the loss of 
<A NAME="332"></A>a few men, and the general rout, durst not face us from a height of thirty 
<A NAME="333"></A>feet; but throwing themselves from the mole into the sea, endeavored to 
<A NAME="334"></A>gain the town, though above eight hundred paces distant. Many however were 
<A NAME="335"></A>slain, and about six hundred taken.
<A NAME="336"></A><BR><BR>Chapter 19
<A NAME="337"></A><BR><BR>Caesar, giving up the plunder to the soldiers, ordered the houses 
<A NAME="338"></A>to be demolished, but fortified the castle at the end of the bridge next 
<A NAME="339"></A>the island, and placed a garrison in it. This the Pharians had abandoned; 
<A NAME="340"></A>but the other, toward the town, which was considerably stronger, was still 
<A NAME="341"></A>held by the Alexandrians. Caesar attacked it next day; because by getting 
<A NAME="342"></A>possession of these two forts, he would be entirely master of the port, 
<A NAME="343"></A>and prevent sudden excursions and piracies. Already he had, by means of 
<A NAME="344"></A>his arrows and engines, forced the garrison to abandon the place, and retire 
<A NAME="345"></A>toward the town. He had also landed three cohorts which was all the place 
<A NAME="346"></A>would contain; the rest of his troops were stationed in their ships. This 
<A NAME="347"></A>being done, he orders them to fortify the bridge against the enemy, and 
<A NAME="348"></A>to fill with stones and block up the arch on which the bridge was built, 
<A NAME="349"></A>through which there was egress for the ships. When one of these works was 
<A NAME="350"></A>accomplished so effectually, that no boat could pass out at all, and when 
<A NAME="351"></A>the other was commenced, the Alexandrians sallied, in crowds from the town, 
<A NAME="352"></A>and drew up in an open place, over against the intrenchment we had cast 
<A NAME="353"></A>up at the head of the bridge. At the same time they stationed at the mole 
<A NAME="354"></A>the vessels which they had been wont to make pass under the bridge, to 
<A NAME="355"></A>set fire to our ships of burden. Our men fought from the bridge and the 
<A NAME="356"></A>mole; the enemy from the space, opposite to the bridge, and from their 
<A NAME="357"></A>ships, by the side of the mole.
<A NAME="358"></A><BR><BR>Chapter 20
<A NAME="359"></A><BR><BR>While Caesar was engaged in these things, and in exhorting his 
<A NAME="360"></A>troops, a number of rowers and mariners, quitting their ships, threw themselves 
<A NAME="361"></A>upon the mole, partly out of curiosity, partly to have a share in the action. 
<A NAME="362"></A>At first, with stones and slings, they forced the enemy's ships from the 
<A NAME="363"></A>mole; and seemed to do still greater execution with their darts. But when, 
<A NAME="364"></A>some time after, a few Alexandrians found means to land, and attack them 
<A NAME="365"></A>in flank, as they had left their ships without order or discipline, so 
<A NAME="366"></A>they soon began to flee, with precipitation. The Alexandrians, encouraged 
<A NAME="367"></A>by this success, landed in great numbers, and vigorously pressed upon our 
<A NAME="368"></A>men, who were, by this time, in great confusion. Those that remained in 
<A NAME="369"></A>the galleys perceiving this, drew up the ladders and put off from the shore, 
<A NAME="370"></A>to prevent the enemy's boarding them. Our soldiers who belonged to the 
<A NAME="371"></A>three cohorts, which were at the head of the mole to guard the bridge, 
<A NAME="372"></A>astonished at this disorder, the cries they heard behind them, and the 
<A NAME="373"></A>general rout of their party, unable besides to bear up against the great 
<A NAME="374"></A>number of darts which came pouring upon them, and fearing to be surrounded, 
<A NAME="375"></A>and have their retreat cut off, by the departure of their ships, abandoned 
<A NAME="376"></A>the fortifications which they had commenced at the bridge, and ran, with 
<A NAME="377"></A>all the speed they could, toward the galleys: some getting on board the 
<A NAME="378"></A>nearest vessels, overloaded and sank them: part, resisting the enemy, and 
<A NAME="379"></A>uncertain what course to take, were cut to pieces by the Alexandrians. 
<A NAME="380"></A>Others, more fortunate, got to the ships that rode at anchor; and a few, 
<A NAME="381"></A>supported by their bucklers, making a determined struggle, swam to the 
<A NAME="382"></A>nearest vessels.
<A NAME="383"></A><BR><BR>Chapter 21
<A NAME="384"></A><BR><BR>Caesar, endeavoring to re-animate his men, and lead them back to 
<A NAME="385"></A>the defense of the works, was exposed to the same danger as the rest; when, 
<A NAME="386"></A>finding them universally to give ground, he retreated to his own galley, 
<A NAME="387"></A>whither such a multitude followed and crowded after him, that it was impossible 
<A NAME="388"></A>either to work or put her off. Foreseeing what must happen, he flung himself 
<A NAME="389"></A>into the sea, and swam to the ships that lay at some distance. Hence dispatching 
<A NAME="390"></A>boats to succor his men, he, by that means, preserved a small number. His 
<A NAME="391"></A>own ship, being sunk by the multitude that crowded into her, went down 
<A NAME="392"></A>with all that were on board. About four hundred legionary soldiers, and 
<A NAME="393"></A>somewhat above that number of sailors and rowers, were lost in this action. 
<A NAME="394"></A>The Alexandrians secured the fort by strong works, and a great number of 
<A NAME="395"></A>engines; and having cleared away the stones with which Caesar had blocked 
<A NAME="396"></A>up the port, enjoyed henceforward a free and open navigation.
<A NAME="397"></A><BR><BR>Chapter 22
<A NAME="398"></A><BR><BR>Our men were so far from being disheartened at this loss, that 
<A NAME="399"></A>they seemed rather roused and animated by it. They made continual sallies 
<A NAME="400"></A>upon the enemy, to destroy or check the progress of their works; fell upon 
<A NAME="401"></A>them as often as they had an opportunity; and never failed to intercept 
<A NAME="402"></A>them, when they ventured to advance beyond their fortifications. In short, 
<A NAME="403"></A>the legions were so bent upon fighting, that they even exceeded the orders 
<A NAME="404"></A>and exhortations of Caesar. They were inconsolable for their late disgrace, 
<A NAME="405"></A>and impatient to come to blows with the enemy; insomuch, that he found 
<A NAME="406"></A>it necessary rather to restrain and check their ardor, than incite them 
<A NAME="407"></A>to action.
<A NAME="408"></A><BR><BR>Chapter 23
<A NAME="409"></A><BR><BR>The Alexandrians, perceiving that success confirmed the Romans, 
<A NAME="410"></A>and that adverse fortune only animated them the more, as they knew of no 
<A NAME="411"></A>medium between these on which to ground any further hopes, resolved, as 
<A NAME="412"></A>far as we can conjecture, either by the advice of the friends of their 
<A NAME="413"></A>king who were in Caesar's quarter, or of their own previous design, intimated 
<A NAME="414"></A>to the king by secret emissaries, to send embassadors to Caesar to request 
<A NAME="415"></A>him, "To dismiss their king and suffer him to rejoin his subjects; that 
<A NAME="416"></A>the people, weary of subjection to a woman, of living under a precarious 
<A NAME="417"></A>government, and submitting to the cruel laws of the tyrant Ganymed, were 
<A NAME="418"></A>ready to execute the orders of the king: and if by his sanction they should 
<A NAME="419"></A>embrace the alliance and protection of Caesar, the multitude would not 
<A NAME="420"></A>be deterred from surrendering by the fear of danger."
<A NAME="421"></A><BR><BR>Chapter 24
<A NAME="422"></A><BR><BR>Though Caesar knew the nation to be false and perfidious, seldom 
<A NAME="423"></A>speaking as they really thought, yet he judged it best to comply with their 
<A NAME="424"></A>desire. He even flattered himself, that his condescension in sending back 
<A NAME="425"></A>their king at their request, would prevail on them to be faithful; or, 
<A NAME="426"></A>as was more agreeable to their character, if they only wanted the king 
<A NAME="427"></A>to head their army, at least it would be more for his honor and credit 
<A NAME="428"></A>to have to do with a monarch than with a band of slaves and fugitives. 
<A NAME="429"></A>Accordingly, he exhorted the king, "To take the government into his own 
<A NAME="430"></A>hands, and consult the welfare of so fair and illustrious a kingdom, defaced 
<A NAME="431"></A>by hideous ruins and conflagrations. To make his subjects sensible of their 
<A NAME="432"></A>duty, preserve them from the destruction that threatened them, and act 
<A NAME="433"></A>with fidelity toward himself and the Romans, who put so much confidence 
<A NAME="434"></A>in him, as to send him among armed enemies." Then taking him by the hand, 
<A NAME="435"></A>he dismissed the young prince who was fast approaching manhood. But his 
<A NAME="436"></A>mind being thoroughly versed in the art of dissimulation, and no way degenerating 
<A NAME="437"></A>from the character of his nation, he entreated Caesar with tears not to 
<A NAME="438"></A>send him back; for that his company was to him preferable to a kingdom. 
<A NAME="439"></A>Caesar, moved at his concern, dried up his tears; and telling him, if these 
<A NAME="440"></A>were his real sentiments, they would soon meet again, dismissed him. The 
<A NAME="441"></A>king, like a wild beast escaped out of confinement, carried on the war 
<A NAME="442"></A>with such acrimony against Caesar, that the tears he shed at parting seemed 
<A NAME="443"></A>to have been tears of joy. Caesar's lieutenants, friends, centurions, and 
<A NAME="444"></A>soldiers, were delighted that this had happened; because his easiness of 
<A NAME="445"></A>temper had been imposed upon by a child: as if in truth Caesar's behavior 
<A NAME="446"></A>on this occasion had been the effect of easiness of temper, and not of 
<A NAME="447"></A>the most consummate prudence.
<A NAME="448"></A><BR><BR>Chapter 25
<A NAME="449"></A><BR><BR>When the Alexandrians found that on the recovery of their king, 
<A NAME="450"></A>neither had they become stronger, nor the Romans weaker; that the troops 
<A NAME="451"></A>despised the youth and weakness of their king; and that their affairs were 
<A NAME="452"></A>in no way bettered by his presence: they were greatly discouraged; and 
<A NAME="453"></A>a report ran that a large body of troops was marching by land from Syria 
<A NAME="454"></A>and Cilicia to Caesar's assistance (of which he had not as yet himself 
<A NAME="455"></A>received information); still they determined to intercept the convoys that 
<A NAME="456"></A>came to him by sea. To this end, having equipped some ships, they ordered 
<A NAME="457"></A>them to cruise before the Canopic branch of the Nile, by which they thought 
<A NAME="458"></A>it most likely our supplies would arrive. Caesar, who was informed of it, 
<A NAME="459"></A>ordered his fleet to get ready, and gave the command of it to Tiberius 
<A NAME="460"></A>Nero. The Rhodian galleys made part of this squadron, headed by Euphranor 
<A NAME="461"></A>their admiral, without whom there never was a successful engagement fought. 
<A NAME="462"></A>But fortune, which often reserves the heaviest disasters for those who 
<A NAME="463"></A>have been loaded with her highest favors, encountered Euphranor upon this 
<A NAME="464"></A>occasion, with an aspect very different from what she had hitherto worn. 
<A NAME="465"></A>For when our ships were arrived at Canopus, and the fleets drawn up on 
<A NAME="466"></A>each side had begun the engagement, Euphranor, according to custom, having 
<A NAME="467"></A>made the first attack, and pierced and sunk one of the enemy's ships; as 
<A NAME="468"></A>he pursued the next a considerable way, without being sufficiently supported 
<A NAME="469"></A>by those that followed him, he was surrounded by the Alexandrians. None 
<A NAME="470"></A>of the fleet advanced to his relief, either out of fear for their own safety, 
<A NAME="471"></A>or because they imagined he would easily be able to extricate himself by 
<A NAME="472"></A>his courage and good fortune. Accordingly he alone behaved well in this 
<A NAME="473"></A>action, and perished with his victorious galley.
<A NAME="474"></A><BR><BR>Chapter 26
<A NAME="475"></A><BR><BR>About the same time Mithridates of Pergamus, a man of illustrious 
<A NAME="476"></A>descent, distinguished for his bravery and knowledge of the art of war, 
<A NAME="477"></A>and who held a very high place in the friendship and confidence of Caesar, 
<A NAME="478"></A>having been sent in the beginning of the Alexandrian war, to raise succors 
<A NAME="479"></A>in Syria and Cilicia, arrived by land at the head of a great body of troops, 
<A NAME="480"></A>which his diligence, and the affection of these two provinces, had enabled 
<A NAME="481"></A>him to draw together in a very short time. He conducted them first to Pelusium, 
<A NAME="482"></A>where Egypt joins Syria. Achillas, who was perfectly well acquainted with 
<A NAME="483"></A>its importance, had seized and put a strong garrison into it. For Egypt 
<A NAME="484"></A>is considered as defended on all sides by strong barriers; on the side 
<A NAME="485"></A>of the sea by the Pharos, and on the side of Syria by Pelusium, which are 
<A NAME="486"></A>accounted the two keys of that kingdom. He attacked it so briskly with 
<A NAME="487"></A>a large body of troops, fresh men continually succeeding in the place of 
<A NAME="488"></A>those that were fatigued, and urged the assault with so much firmness and 
<A NAME="489"></A>perseverance, that he carried it the same day on which he attacked it, 
<A NAME="490"></A>and placed a garrison in it. Thence he pursued his march to Alexandria, 
<A NAME="491"></A>reducing all the provinces through which he passed, and conciliating them 
<A NAME="492"></A>to Caesar, by that authority which always accompanies the 
<A NAME="493"></A>conqueror.
<A NAME="494"></A><BR><BR>Chapter 27
<A NAME="495"></A><BR><BR>Not far from Alexandria lies Delta, the most celebrated province 
<A NAME="496"></A>of Egypt, which derives its name from the Greek letter so called. For the 
<A NAME="497"></A>Nile, dividing into two channels, which gradually diverge as they approach 
<A NAME="498"></A>the sea, into which they at last discharge themselves, at a considerable 
<A NAME="499"></A>distance from one another, leaves an intermediate space in form of a triangle. 
<A NAME="500"></A>The king understanding that Mithridates was approaching this place, and 
<A NAME="501"></A>knowing he must pass the river, sent a large body of troops against him, 
<A NAME="502"></A>sufficient, as he thought, if not to overwhelm and crush him, at least 
<A NAME="503"></A>to stop his march, for though he earnestly desired to see him defeated, 
<A NAME="504"></A>yet he thought it a great point gained, to hinder his junction with Caesar. 
<A NAME="505"></A>The troops that first passed the river, and came up with Mithridates, attacked 
<A NAME="506"></A>him immediately, hastening to snatch the honor of victory from the troops 
<A NAME="507"></A>that were marching to their aid. Mithridates at first confined himself 
<A NAME="508"></A>to the defense of his camp, which he had with great prudence fortified 
<A NAME="509"></A>according to the custom of the Romans: but observing that they advanced 
<A NAME="510"></A>insolently and without caution, he sallied upon them from all parts, and 
<A NAME="511"></A>put a great number of them to the sword; insomuch that, but for their knowledge 
<A NAME="512"></A>of the ground, and the neighborhood of the vessels in which they had passed 
<A NAME="513"></A>the river, they must have been all destroyed. But recovering by degrees 
<A NAME="514"></A>from their terror, and joining the troops that followed them, they again 
<A NAME="515"></A>prepared to attack Mithridates.
<A NAME="516"></A><BR><BR>Chapter 28
<A NAME="517"></A><BR><BR>A messenger was sent by Mithridates to Caesar, to inform him of 
<A NAME="518"></A>what had happened. The king learns from his followers that the action had 
<A NAME="519"></A>taken place. Thus, much about the same time, Ptolemy set out to crush Mithridates, 
<A NAME="520"></A>and Caesar to relieve him. The king made use of the more expeditious conveyance 
<A NAME="521"></A>of the Nile, where he had a large fleet in readiness. Caesar declined the 
<A NAME="522"></A>navigation of the river, that he might not be obliged to engage the enemy's 
<A NAME="523"></A>fleet; and coasting along the African shore, found means to join the victorious 
<A NAME="524"></A>troops of Mithridates, before Ptolemy could attack him. The king had encamped 
<A NAME="525"></A>in a place fortified by nature, being an eminence surrounded on all sides 
<A NAME="526"></A>by a plain. Three of its sides were secured by various defenses. One was 
<A NAME="527"></A>washed by the river Nile, the other was steep and inaccessible, and the 
<A NAME="528"></A>third was defended by a morass.
<A NAME="529"></A><BR><BR>Chapter 29
<A NAME="530"></A><BR><BR>Between Ptolemy's camp and Caesar's route lay a narrow river with 
<A NAME="531"></A>very steep banks, which discharged itself into the Nile. This river was 
<A NAME="532"></A>about seven miles from the king's camp; who, understanding that Caesar 
<A NAME="533"></A>was directing his march that way, sent all his cavalry, with a choice body 
<A NAME="534"></A>of light-armed foot, to prevent Caesar from crossing, and maintain an unequal 
<A NAME="535"></A>fight from the banks, where courage had no opportunity to exert itself, 
<A NAME="536"></A>and cowardice ran no hazard. Our men, both horse and foot, were extremely 
<A NAME="537"></A>mortified, that the Alexandrians should so long maintain their ground against 
<A NAME="538"></A>them. Wherefore, some of the German cavalry, dispersing in quest of a ford, 
<A NAME="539"></A>found means to swim the river where the banks were lowest; and the legionaries 
<A NAME="540"></A>at the same time cutting down several large trees, that reached from one 
<A NAME="541"></A>bank to another, and constructing suddenly a mound, by their help got to 
<A NAME="542"></A>the other side. The enemy were so much in dread of their attack, that they 
<A NAME="543"></A>betook themselves to flight; but in vain: for very few returned to the 
<A NAME="544"></A>king, almost all being cut to pieces in the pursuit.
<A NAME="545"></A><BR><BR>Chapter 30
<A NAME="546"></A><BR><BR>Caesar, upon this success, judging that his sudden approach must 
<A NAME="547"></A>strike great terror into the Alexandrians, advanced toward their camp with 
<A NAME="548"></A>his victorious army. But finding it well intrenched, strongly fortified 
<A NAME="549"></A>by nature, and the ramparts covered with armed soldiers, he did not think 
<A NAME="550"></A>proper that his troops, who were very much fatigued both by their march 
<A NAME="551"></A>and the late battle, should attack it; and therefore encamped at a small 
<A NAME="552"></A>distance from the enemy. Next day he attacked a fort, in a village not 
<A NAME="553"></A>far off, which the king had fortified and joined to his camp by a line 
<A NAME="554"></A>of communication, with a view to keep possession of the village. He attacked 
<A NAME="555"></A>it with his whole army, and took it by storm; not because it would have 
<A NAME="556"></A>been difficult to carry it with a few forces; but with the design of falling 
<A NAME="557"></A>immediately upon the enemy's camp, during the alarm which the loss of this 
<A NAME="558"></A>fort must give them. Accordingly, the Romans, in continuing the pursuit 
<A NAME="559"></A>of those that fled from the fort, arrived at last before the Alexandrian 
<A NAME="560"></A>camp, and commenced a most furious action at a distance. There were two 
<A NAME="561"></A>approaches by which it might be attacked; one by the plain, of which we 
<A NAME="562"></A>have spoken before, the other by a narrow pass, between their camp and 
<A NAME="563"></A>the Nile. The first, which was much the easiest, was defended by a numerous 
<A NAME="564"></A>body of their best troops; and the access on the side of the Nile gave 
<A NAME="565"></A>the enemy great advantage in distressing and wounding our men; for they 
<A NAME="566"></A>were exposed to a double shower of darts: in front from the rampart, behind 
<A NAME="567"></A>from the river; where the enemy had stationed a great number of ships, 
<A NAME="568"></A>furnished with archers and slingers, that kept up a continual 
<A NAME="569"></A>discharge.
<A NAME="570"></A><BR><BR>Chapter 31
<A NAME="571"></A><BR><BR>Caesar, observing that his troops fought with the utmost ardor, 
<A NAME="572"></A>and yet made no great progress, on account of the disadvantage of the ground; 
<A NAME="573"></A>and perceiving they had left the highest part of their camp unguarded, 
<A NAME="574"></A>because, it being sufficiently fortified by nature, they had all crowded 
<A NAME="575"></A>to the other attacks, partly to have a share in the action, partly to be 
<A NAME="576"></A>spectators of the issue; he ordered some cohorts to wheel round the camp, 
<A NAME="577"></A>and gain that ascent: appointing Carfulenus to command them, a man distinguished 
<A NAME="578"></A>for bravery and acquaintance with the service. When they had reached the 
<A NAME="579"></A>place, as there were but very few to defend it, our men attacked them so 
<A NAME="580"></A>briskly that the Alexandrians, terrified by the cries they heard behind 
<A NAME="581"></A>them, and seeing themselves attacked both in front and rear, fled in the 
<A NAME="582"></A>utmost consternation on all sides. Our men, animated by the confusion of 
<A NAME="583"></A>the enemy, entered the camp in several places at the same time, and running 
<A NAME="584"></A>down from the higher ground, put a great number of them to the sword. The 
<A NAME="585"></A>Alexandrians, endeavoring to escape, threw themselves in crowds over the 
<A NAME="586"></A>rampart in the quarter next the river. The foremost tumbling into the ditch, 
<A NAME="587"></A>where they were crushed to death, furnished an easy passage for those that 
<A NAME="588"></A>followed. It is ascertained that the king escaped from the camp, and was 
<A NAME="589"></A>received on board a ship; but by the crowd that followed him, the ship 
<A NAME="590"></A>in which he fled was overloaded and sunk.
<A NAME="591"></A><BR><BR>Chapter 32
<A NAME="592"></A><BR><BR>After this speedy and successful action, Caesar, in consequence 
<A NAME="593"></A>of so great a victory, marched the nearest way by land to Alexandria with 
<A NAME="594"></A>his cavalry, and entered triumphant into that part of the town which was 
<A NAME="595"></A>possessed by the enemy's guards. He was not mistaken in thinking that the 
<A NAME="596"></A>Alexandrians, upon hearing of the issue of the battle, would give over 
<A NAME="597"></A>all thoughts of war. Accordingly, as soon as he arrived, he reaped the 
<A NAME="598"></A>just fruit of his valor and magnanimity. For all the multitude of the inhabitants, 
<A NAME="599"></A>throwing down their arms, abandoning their works, and assuming the habit 
<A NAME="600"></A>of suppliants, preceded by all those sacred symbols of religion with which 
<A NAME="601"></A>they were wont to mollify their offended kings, met Caesar on his arrival 
<A NAME="602"></A>and surrendered. Caesar, accepting their submission, and encouraging them, 
<A NAME="603"></A>advanced through the enemy's works into his own quarter of the town, where 
<A NAME="604"></A>he was received with the universal congratulations of his party, who were 
<A NAME="605"></A>no less overjoyed at his arrival and presence, than at the happy issue 
<A NAME="606"></A>of the war.
<A NAME="607"></A><BR><BR>Chapter 33
<A NAME="608"></A><BR><BR>Caesar, having thus made himself master of Alexandria and Egypt, 
<A NAME="609"></A>lodged the government in the hands of those to whom Ptolemy had bequeathed 
<A NAME="610"></A>it by will, conjuring the Roman people not to permit any change. For the 
<A NAME="611"></A>eldest of Ptolemy's two sons being dead, Caesar settled the kingdom upon 
<A NAME="612"></A>the youngest, in conjunction with Cleopatra, the elder of the two sisters, 
<A NAME="613"></A>who had always continued under his protection and guardianship. The younger, 
<A NAME="614"></A>Arsinoe, in whose name Ganymed, as we have seen, tyrannically reigned for 
<A NAME="615"></A>some time he thought proper to banish the kingdom, that she might not raise 
<A NAME="616"></A>any new disturbance, through the agency of seditious men, before the king's 
<A NAME="617"></A>authority should be firmly established. Taking the sixth veteran legion 
<A NAME="618"></A>with him into Syria, he left the rest in Egypt to support the authority 
<A NAME="619"></A>of the king and queen, neither of whom stood well in the affections of 
<A NAME="620"></A>their subjects, on account of their attachment to Caesar, nor could be 
<A NAME="621"></A>supposed to have given any fixed foundation to their power, in an administration 
<A NAME="622"></A>of only a few days' continuance. It was also for the honor and interest 
<A NAME="623"></A>of the republic that if they continued faithful our forces should protect 
<A NAME="624"></A>them; but if ungrateful that they should be restrained by the same power. 
<A NAME="625"></A>Having thus settled the kingdom, he marched by land into 
<A NAME="626"></A>Syria.
<A NAME="627"></A><BR><BR>Chapter 34
<A NAME="628"></A><BR><BR>While these things passed in Egypt, king Deiotarus applied to Domitius 
<A NAME="629"></A>Calvinus, to whom Caesar had intrusted the government of Asia and the neighboring 
<A NAME="630"></A>provinces, beseeching him "not to suffer the Lesser Armenia which was his 
<A NAME="631"></A>kingdom, or Cappadocia, which belonged to Ariobarzanes, to be seized and 
<A NAME="632"></A>laid waste by Pharnaces, because, unless they were delivered from these 
<A NAME="633"></A>insults, it would be impossible for them to execute Caesar's orders, or 
<A NAME="634"></A>raise the money they stood engaged to pay." Domitius, who was not only 
<A NAME="635"></A>sensible of the necessity of money to defray the expenses of the war, but 
<A NAME="636"></A>likewise thought it dishonorable to the people of Rome and the victorious 
<A NAME="637"></A>Caesar, as well as infamous to himself, to suffer the dominions of allies 
<A NAME="638"></A>and friends to be usurped by a foreign prince, sent embassadors to Pharnaces, 
<A NAME="639"></A>to acquaint him, "That he must withdraw immediately from Armenia and Cappadocia, 
<A NAME="640"></A>and no longer insult the majesty and right of the Roman people, while engaged 
<A NAME="641"></A>in a civil war." But believing that his deputation would have greater weight, 
<A NAME="642"></A>if he was ready to second it himself at the head of an army; he repaired 
<A NAME="643"></A>to the legions which were then in Asia, ordering two of them into Egypt, 
<A NAME="644"></A>at Caesar's desire, and carrying the thirty-sixth: along with him. To the 
<A NAME="645"></A>thirty-sixth legion Deiotarus added two more, which he had trained up for 
<A NAME="646"></A>several years, according to our discipline; and a hundred horse. The like 
<A NAME="647"></A>number of horse were furnished by Ariobarzanes. At the same time, he sent 
<A NAME="648"></A>P. Sextius to C. Plaetorius the questor, for the legion which had been 
<A NAME="649"></A>lately levied in Pontus; and Quinctius Partisius into Cilicia, to draw 
<A NAME="650"></A>thence a body of auxiliary troops. All these forces speedily assembled 
<A NAME="651"></A>at Comana, by orders of Domitius.
<A NAME="652"></A><BR><BR>Chapter 35
<A NAME="653"></A><BR><BR>Meanwhile his embassadors bring back the following answer from 
<A NAME="654"></A>Pharnaces: "That he had quitted Cappadocia; but kept possession of the 
<A NAME="655"></A>Lesser Armenia, as his own, by right of inheritance: that he was willing, 
<A NAME="656"></A>however, to submit every thing to the decision of Caesar, to whose commands 
<A NAME="657"></A>he would pay immediate obedience." C. Domitius, sensible that he had quitted 
<A NAME="658"></A>Cappadocia, not voluntarily, but out of necessity; because he could more 
<A NAME="659"></A>easily defend Armenia, which lay contiguous to his own kingdom, than Cappadocia, 
<A NAME="660"></A>which was more remote: and because believing, at first, that Domitius had 
<A NAME="661"></A>brought all the three legions along with him, upon hearing that two were 
<A NAME="662"></A>gone to Caesar, he seemed more determined to keep possession; and insisted 
<A NAME="663"></A>"upon his quitting Armenia likewise, as the same right existed in both 
<A NAME="664"></A>cases; nor was it just to demand that the matter should be postponed till 
<A NAME="665"></A>Caesar's return, unless things were put in the condition in which they 
<A NAME="666"></A>were at first." Having returned this answer, he advanced toward Armenia, 
<A NAME="667"></A>with the forces above-mentioned, directing his march along the hills; for 
<A NAME="668"></A>from Pontus, by way of Comana, runs a woody ridge of hills, that extends 
<A NAME="669"></A>as far as Lesser Armenia, dividing it from Cappadocia. The advantages he 
<A NAME="670"></A>had in view, by such a march, were, that he would thereby effectually prevent 
<A NAME="671"></A>all surprises, and be plentifully supplied with provisions from 
<A NAME="672"></A>Cappadocia.
<A NAME="673"></A><BR><BR>Chapter 36
<A NAME="674"></A><BR><BR>Meantime Pharnaces sends several embassies to Domitius to treat 
<A NAME="675"></A>of peace, bearing royal gifts. All these he firmly rejected, telling the 
<A NAME="676"></A>deputies: "That nothing was more sacred with him, than the majesty of the 
<A NAME="677"></A>Roman people, and recovering the rights of their allies." After long and 
<A NAME="678"></A>continued marches, he reached Nicopolis (which is a city of Lesser Armenia, 
<A NAME="679"></A>situated in a plain, having mountains, however, on its two sides, at a 
<A NAME="680"></A>considerable distance), and encamped about seven miles from the town. Between 
<A NAME="681"></A>his camp and Nicopolis, lay a difficult and narrow pass, where Pharnaces 
<A NAME="682"></A>placed a chosen body of foot, and all his horse, in ambuscade. He ordered 
<A NAME="683"></A>a great number of cattle to be dispersed in the pass, and the townsmen 
<A NAME="684"></A>and peasants to show themselves, that if Domitius entered the defile as 
<A NAME="685"></A>a friend, he might have no suspicion of an ambuscade, when he saw the men 
<A NAME="686"></A>and flocks dispersed, without apprehension, in the fields; or if he should 
<A NAME="687"></A>come as an enemy, that the soldiers, quitting their ranks to pillage, might 
<A NAME="688"></A>be cut to pieces when dispersed.
<A NAME="689"></A><BR><BR>Chapter 37
<A NAME="690"></A><BR><BR>While this design was going forward, he never ceased sending embassadors 
<A NAME="691"></A>to Domitius, with proposals of peace and amity, fancying, by this means, 
<A NAME="692"></A>the more easy to ensnare him. The expectation of peace kept Domitius in 
<A NAME="693"></A>his camp; so that Pharnaces, having missed the opportunity, and fearing 
<A NAME="694"></A>the ambuscade might be discovered, drew off his troops. Next day Domitius 
<A NAME="695"></A>approached Nicopolis, and encamped near the town. While our men were working 
<A NAME="696"></A>at the trenches, Pharnaces drew up his army in order of battle, forming 
<A NAME="697"></A>his front into one line, according to the custom of the country, and securing 
<A NAME="698"></A>his wings with a triple body of reserves. In the same manner, the center 
<A NAME="699"></A>was formed in single files, and two intervals were left on the right and 
<A NAME="700"></A>left. Domitius, ordering part of the troops to continue under arms before 
<A NAME="701"></A>the rampart, completed the fortifications of his camp.
<A NAME="702"></A><BR><BR>Chapter 38
<A NAME="703"></A><BR><BR>Next night, Pharnaces, having intercepted the couriers who brought 
<A NAME="704"></A>Domitius an account of the posture of affairs at Alexandria, understood 
<A NAME="705"></A>that Caesar was in great danger, and requested Domitius to send him succors 
<A NAME="706"></A>speedily, and come himself to Alexandria by the way of Syria. Pharnaces, 
<A NAME="707"></A>upon this intelligence, imagined that protracting the time would be equivalent 
<A NAME="708"></A>to a victory, because Domitius, he supposed, must very soon depart. He 
<A NAME="709"></A>therefore dug two ditches, four feet deep, at a moderate distance from 
<A NAME="710"></A>each other, on that side where lay the easiest access to the town and our 
<A NAME="711"></A>forces might, most advantageously, attack him; resolving not to advance 
<A NAME="712"></A>beyond them. Between these, he constantly drew up his army, placing all 
<A NAME="713"></A>his cavalry upon the wings without them, which greatly exceeded ours in 
<A NAME="714"></A>number, and would otherwise have been useless.
<A NAME="715"></A><BR><BR>Chapter 39
<A NAME="716"></A><BR><BR>Domitius, more concerned at Caesar's danger than his own, and believing 
<A NAME="717"></A>he could not retire with safety, should he now desire the conditions he 
<A NAME="718"></A>had rejected, or march away without any apparent cause, drew his forces 
<A NAME="719"></A>out of the camp, and ranged them in order of battle. He placed the thirty-sixth 
<A NAME="720"></A>legion on the right, that of Pontus on the left, and those of Deiotarus 
<A NAME="721"></A>in the main body; drawing them up with a very narrow front, and posting 
<A NAME="722"></A>the rest of the cohorts to sustain the wings. The armies being thus drawn 
<A NAME="723"></A>up on each side, they advanced to the battle.
<A NAME="724"></A><BR><BR>Chapter 40
<A NAME="725"></A><BR><BR>The signal being given at the same time by both parties, they engage. 
<A NAME="726"></A>The conflict was sharp and various, for the thirty-sixth legion falling 
<A NAME="727"></A>upon the king's cavalry, that was drawn up without the ditch, charged them 
<A NAME="728"></A>so successfully, that they drove them to the very walls of the town, passed 
<A NAME="729"></A>the ditch, and attacked their infantry in the rear. But on the other side, 
<A NAME="730"></A>the legion of Pontus having given way, the second line, which advanced 
<A NAME="731"></A>to sustain them, making a circuit round the ditch, in order to attack the 
<A NAME="732"></A>enemy in flank, was overwhelmed and borne down by a shower of darts, in 
<A NAME="733"></A>endeavoring to pass it. The legions of Deiotarus made scarcely any resistance; 
<A NAME="734"></A>thus the victorious forces of the king turned their right wing and main 
<A NAME="735"></A>body against the thirty-sixth legion, which yet made a brave stand; and 
<A NAME="736"></A>though surrounded by the forces of the enemy, formed themselves into a 
<A NAME="737"></A>circle, with wonderful presence of mind, and retired to the foot of a mountain, 
<A NAME="738"></A>whither Pharnaces did not think fit to pursue them, on account of the disadvantage 
<A NAME="739"></A>of the place. Thus the legion of Pontus being almost wholly cut off, with 
<A NAME="740"></A>great part of those of Deiotarus, the thirty-sixth legion retreated to 
<A NAME="741"></A>an eminence, with the loss of about two hundred and fifty men. Several 
<A NAME="742"></A>Roman knights, of illustrious rank, fell in this battle. Domitius, after 
<A NAME="743"></A>this defeat, rallied the remains of his broken army, and retreated, by 
<A NAME="744"></A>safe ways, through Cappadocia, into Asia.
<A NAME="745"></A><BR><BR>Chapter 41
<A NAME="746"></A><BR><BR>Pharnaces, elated with this success, as he expected that Caesar's 
<A NAME="747"></A>difficulties would terminate as he [Pharnaces] wished, entered Pontus with 
<A NAME="748"></A>all his forces. There, acting as conqueror and a most cruel king, and promising 
<A NAME="749"></A>himself a happier destiny than his father, he stormed many towns, and seized 
<A NAME="750"></A>the effects of the Roman and Pontic citizens, inflicted punishments, worse 
<A NAME="751"></A>than death, upon such as were distinguished by their age or beauty, and 
<A NAME="752"></A>having made himself master of all Pontus, as there was no one to oppose 
<A NAME="753"></A>his progress, boasted that he had recovered his father's 
<A NAME="754"></A>kingdom.
<A NAME="755"></A><BR><BR>Chapter 42
<A NAME="756"></A><BR><BR>About the same time, we received a considerable check in Illyricum; 
<A NAME="757"></A>which province, had been defended the preceding months, not only without 
<A NAME="758"></A>insult, but even with honor. For Caesar's quaestor, Q. Cornificius, had 
<A NAME="759"></A>been sent there as propraetor, the summer before, with two legions; and 
<A NAME="760"></A>though it was of itself little able to support an army, and at that time 
<A NAME="761"></A>in particular was almost totally ruined by the war in the vicinity, and 
<A NAME="762"></A>the civil dissensions; yet, by his prudence, and vigilance, being very 
<A NAME="763"></A>careful not to undertake any rash expedition, he defended and kept possession 
<A NAME="764"></A>of it. For he made himself master of several forts, built on eminences, 
<A NAME="765"></A>whose advantageous situation tempted the inhabitants to make descents and 
<A NAME="766"></A>inroads upon the country; and gave the plunder of them to his soldiers 
<A NAME="767"></A>(and although this was but inconsiderable, yet as they were no strangers 
<A NAME="768"></A>to the distress and ill condition of the province, they did not cease to 
<A NAME="769"></A>be grateful; the rather as it was the fruit of their own valor). And when, 
<A NAME="770"></A>after the battle of Pharsalia, Octavius had retreated to that coast with 
<A NAME="771"></A>a large fleet; Cornificius, with some vessels of the inhabitants of Jadua, 
<A NAME="772"></A>who had always continued faithful to the commonwealth, made himself master 
<A NAME="773"></A>of the greatest part of his ships, which, joined to those of his allies, 
<A NAME="774"></A>rendered him capable of sustaining even a naval engagement. And while Caesar, 
<A NAME="775"></A>victorious, was pursuing Pompey to the remotest parts of the earth; when 
<A NAME="776"></A>he [Cornificius] heard that the enemy had, for the most part, retired into 
<A NAME="777"></A>Illyricum, on account of its neighborhood to Macedonia, and were there 
<A NAME="778"></A>collecting such as survived the defeat [at Pharsalia], he wrote to Gabinius, 
<A NAME="779"></A>"To repair directly thither, with the new raised legions, and join Cornificius, 
<A NAME="780"></A>that if any danger should assail the province, he might ward it off, but 
<A NAME="781"></A>if less forces sufficed, to march into Macedonia, which he foresaw would 
<A NAME="782"></A>never be free from commotions, so long as Pompey lived."
<A NAME="783"></A><BR><BR>Chapter 43
<A NAME="784"></A><BR><BR>Gabinius, whether he imagined the province better provided than 
<A NAME="785"></A>it really was, or depended much upon the auspicious fortune of Caesar, 
<A NAME="786"></A>or confided in his own valor and abilities, he having often terminated 
<A NAME="787"></A>with success difficult and dangerous wars, marched into Illyricum, in the 
<A NAME="788"></A>middle of winter, and the most difficult season of the year; where, not 
<A NAME="789"></A>finding sufficient subsistence in the province, which was partly exhausted, 
<A NAME="790"></A>partly disaffected, and having no supplies by sea, because the season of 
<A NAME="791"></A>the year had put a stop to navigation, he found himself compelled to carry 
<A NAME="792"></A>on the war, not according to his own inclination, but as necessity allowed. 
<A NAME="793"></A>As he was therefore obliged to lay siege to forts and castles, in a very 
<A NAME="794"></A>rude season, he received many checks, and fell under such contempt with 
<A NAME="795"></A>the barbarians, that while retiring to Salona, a maritime city, inhabited 
<A NAME="796"></A>by a set of brave and faithful Romans, he was compelled to come to an engagement 
<A NAME="797"></A>on his march; and after the loss of two thousand soldiers, thirty-eight 
<A NAME="798"></A>centurions, and four tribunes, got to Salona with the rest; where his wants 
<A NAME="799"></A>continually increasing, he died a few days after. His misfortunes and sudden 
<A NAME="800"></A>death gave Octavius great hopes of reducing the province. But fortune, 
<A NAME="801"></A>whose influence is so great in matters of war, joined to the diligence 
<A NAME="802"></A>of Cornificius, and the valor of Vatinius, soon put an end to his 
<A NAME="803"></A>triumphs.
<A NAME="804"></A><BR><BR>Chapter 44
<A NAME="805"></A><BR><BR>Vatinius, who was then at Brundusium, having intelligence of what 
<A NAME="806"></A>passed in Illyricum, by letters from Cornificius, who pressed him to come 
<A NAME="807"></A>to the assistance of the province, and informed him, that Octavius had 
<A NAME="808"></A>leagued with the barbarians, and in several places attacked our garrisons, 
<A NAME="809"></A>partly by sea with his fleet, partly by land with the troops of the barbarians; 
<A NAME="810"></A>Vatinius, I say, upon notice of these things, though extremely weakened 
<A NAME="811"></A>by sickness, insomuch that his strength of body no way answered his resolution 
<A NAME="812"></A>and greatness of mind; yet, by his valor, surmounted all opposition, the 
<A NAME="813"></A>force of his distemper, the rigor of the winter and the difficulties of 
<A NAME="814"></A>a sudden preparation. For having himself but a very few galleys, he wrote 
<A NAME="815"></A>to Q. Kalenus, in Achaia, to furnish him with a squadron of ships. But 
<A NAME="816"></A>these not coming with that dispatch which the danger our army was in required, 
<A NAME="817"></A>because Octavius pressed hard upon them, he fastened beaks to all the barks 
<A NAME="818"></A>and vessels that lay in the port, whose number was considerable enough, 
<A NAME="819"></A>though they were not sufficiently large for an engagement. Joining these 
<A NAME="820"></A>to what galleys he had, and putting on board the veteran soldiers, of whom 
<A NAME="821"></A>he had a great number, belonging to all the legions, who had been left 
<A NAME="822"></A>sick at Brundusium, when the army went over to Greece, he sailed for Illyricum; 
<A NAME="823"></A>where, having subjected several maritime states that had declared for Octavius, 
<A NAME="824"></A>and neglecting such as continued obstinate in their revolt, because he 
<A NAME="825"></A>would suffer nothing to retard his design of meeting the enemy, he came 
<A NAME="826"></A>up with Octavius before Epidaurus; and obliging him to raise the siege, 
<A NAME="827"></A>which he was carrying on with vigor, by sea and land, joined the garrison 
<A NAME="828"></A>to his own forces.
<A NAME="829"></A><BR><BR>Chapter 45
<A NAME="830"></A><BR><BR>Octavius, understanding that Vatinius's fleet consisted mostly 
<A NAME="831"></A>of small barks, and confiding in the strength of his own, stopped at the 
<A NAME="832"></A>Isle of Tauris. Vatinius followed him thither, not imagining he would halt 
<A NAME="833"></A>at that place, but being determined to pursue him wherever he went. Vatinius, 
<A NAME="834"></A>who had no suspicion of an enemy, and whose ships were moreover dispersed 
<A NAME="835"></A>by a tempest, perceived, as he approached the isle, a vessel filled with 
<A NAME="836"></A>soldiers that advanced toward him, in full sail. Upon this he gave orders 
<A NAME="837"></A>for furling the sails, lowering the sail-yards, and arming the soldiers; 
<A NAME="838"></A>and hoisting a flag, as a signal for battle, intimated to the ships that 
<A NAME="839"></A>followed to do the same. Vatinius's men prepared themselves in the best 
<A NAME="840"></A>manner their sudden surprise would allow, while Octavius advanced in good 
<A NAME="841"></A>order, from the port. The two fleets drew up; Octavius had the advantage 
<A NAME="842"></A>in arrangement, and Vatinius in the bravery of his troops.
<A NAME="843"></A><BR><BR>Chapter 46
<A NAME="844"></A><BR><BR>Vatinius, finding himself inferior to the enemy, both in the number 
<A NAME="845"></A>and largeness of his ships, resolved to commit the affair to fortune, and 
<A NAME="846"></A>therefore in his own quinquereme, attacked Octavius in his four-banked 
<A NAME="847"></A>galley. This he did with such violence, and the shock was so great, that 
<A NAME="848"></A>the beak of Octavius's galley was broken. The battle raged with great fury 
<A NAME="849"></A>likewise in other places, but chiefly around the two admirals; for as the 
<A NAME="850"></A>ships on each side advanced to sustain those that fought, a close and furious 
<A NAME="851"></A>conflict ensued in a very narrow sea, where the nearer the vessels approached 
<A NAME="852"></A>the more had Vatinius's soldiers the advantage. For, with admirable courage, 
<A NAME="853"></A>they leaped into the enemy's ships, and forcing them by this means to an 
<A NAME="854"></A>equal combat, soon mastered them by their superior valor. Octavius's galley 
<A NAME="855"></A>was sunk, and many others were taken or suffered the same fate; the soldiers 
<A NAME="856"></A>were partly slain in the ships, partly thrown overboard into the sea. Octavius 
<A NAME="857"></A>got into a boat, which sinking under the multitude that crowded after him, 
<A NAME="858"></A>he himself, though wounded, swam to his brigantine; where, being taken 
<A NAME="859"></A>up, and night having put an end to the battle, as the wind blew very strong, 
<A NAME="860"></A>he spread all his sails and fled. A few of his ships, that had the good 
<A NAME="861"></A>fortune to escape, followed him.
<A NAME="862"></A><BR><BR>Chapter 47
<A NAME="863"></A><BR><BR>But Vatinius, after his success, sounded a retreat, and entered 
<A NAME="864"></A>victorious the port whence Octavius had sailed to fight him, without the 
<A NAME="865"></A>loss of a single vessel. He took, in this battle, one quinquereme, two 
<A NAME="866"></A>triremes, eight two-banked galleys, and a great number of rowers. The next 
<A NAME="867"></A>day was employed in repairing his own fleet, and the ships he had taken 
<A NAME="868"></A>from the enemy: after which, he sailed for the island of Issa, imagining 
<A NAME="869"></A>Octavius had retired thither after his defeat. In this island was a flourishing 
<A NAME="870"></A>city, well affected to Octavius, which however, surrendered to Vatinius, 
<A NAME="871"></A>upon the first summons. Here he understood that Octavius, attended by a 
<A NAME="872"></A>few small barks, had sailed, with a fair wind, for Greece, whence he intended 
<A NAME="873"></A>to pass on to Sicily, and afterward to Africa. Vatinius, having in so short 
<A NAME="874"></A>a space successfully terminated the affair, restored the province, in a 
<A NAME="875"></A>peaceable condition, to Cornificius, and driven the enemy's fleet out of 
<A NAME="876"></A>those seas, returned victorious to Brundusium, with his army and fleet 
<A NAME="877"></A>in good condition.
<A NAME="878"></A><BR><BR>Chapter 48
<A NAME="879"></A><BR><BR>But during the time that Caesar besieged Pompey at Dyrrachium, 
<A NAME="880"></A>triumphed at Old Pharsalia, and carried on the war, with so much danger, 
<A NAME="881"></A>at Alexandria, Cassius Longinus, who had been left in Spain as propraetor 
<A NAME="882"></A>of the further province, either through his natural disposition, or out 
<A NAME="883"></A>of a hatred he had contracted to the province, on account of a wound he 
<A NAME="884"></A>had treacherously received there when quaestor, drew upon himself the general 
<A NAME="885"></A>dislike of the people. He discerned this temper among them, partly from 
<A NAME="886"></A>a consciousness that he deserved it, partly from the manifest indications 
<A NAME="887"></A>they gave of their discontent. To secure himself against their disaffection, 
<A NAME="888"></A>he endeavored to gain the love of the soldiers; and having, for this purpose, 
<A NAME="889"></A>assembled them together, promised them a hundred sesterces each. Soon after, 
<A NAME="890"></A>having made himself master of Medobriga, a town in Lusitania, and of Mount 
<A NAME="891"></A>Herminius, whither the Medobrigians had retired, and being upon that occasion 
<A NAME="892"></A>saluted imperator by the army, he gave them another hundred sesterces each. 
<A NAME="893"></A>These, accompanied by other considerable largesses, in great number, seemed, 
<A NAME="894"></A>for the present, to increase the good-will of the army, but tended gradually 
<A NAME="895"></A>and imperceptibly to the relaxation of military discipline.
<A NAME="896"></A><BR><BR>Chapter 49
<A NAME="897"></A><BR><BR>Cassius, having sent his army into winter quarters, fixed his residence 
<A NAME="898"></A>at Corduba, for the administration of justice. Being greatly in debt, he 
<A NAME="899"></A>resolved to pay it by laying heavy burdens upon the province: and, according 
<A NAME="900"></A>to the custom of prodigals, made his liberalities a pretense to justify 
<A NAME="901"></A>the most exorbitant demands. He taxed the rich at discretion, and compelled 
<A NAME="902"></A>them to pay, without the least regard to their remonstrances; frequently 
<A NAME="903"></A>making light and trifling offenses the handle for all manner of extortions. 
<A NAME="904"></A>All methods of gain were pursued, whether great and reputable, or mean 
<A NAME="905"></A>and sordid. None that had any thing to lose could escape accusation; insomuch, 
<A NAME="906"></A>that the plunder of their private fortunes was aggravated by the dangers 
<A NAME="907"></A>they were exposed to from pretended crimes.
<A NAME="908"></A><BR><BR>Chapter 50
<A NAME="909"></A><BR><BR>For which reasons it happened that when Longinus as proconsul did 
<A NAME="910"></A>those same things which he had done as quaestor, the provincials formed 
<A NAME="911"></A>similar conspiracies against his life. Even his own dependents concurred 
<A NAME="912"></A>in the general hatred; who, though the ministers of his rapine, yet hated 
<A NAME="913"></A>the man by whose authority they committed those crimes. The odium still 
<A NAME="914"></A>increased upon his raising a fifth legion, which added to the expense and 
<A NAME="915"></A>burdens of the province. The cavalry was augmented to three thousand, with 
<A NAME="916"></A>costly ornaments and equipage: nor was any respite given to the 
<A NAME="917"></A>province.
<A NAME="918"></A><BR><BR>Chapter 51
<A NAME="919"></A><BR><BR>Meanwhile he received orders from Caesar, to transport his army 
<A NAME="920"></A>into Africa and march through Mauritania, toward Numidia, because king 
<A NAME="921"></A>Juba had sent considerable succors to Pompey, and was thought likely to 
<A NAME="922"></A>send more. These letters filled him with an insolent joy, by the opportunity 
<A NAME="923"></A>they offered him of pillaging new provinces, and a wealthy kingdom. He 
<A NAME="924"></A>therefore hastened into Lusitania, to assemble his legions, and draw together 
<A NAME="925"></A>a body of auxiliaries; appointing certain persons to provide corn, ships, 
<A NAME="926"></A>and money, that nothing might retard him at his return; which was much 
<A NAME="927"></A>sooner than expected: for when interest called, Cassius wanted neither 
<A NAME="928"></A>industry nor vigilance.
<A NAME="929"></A><BR><BR>Chapter 52
<A NAME="930"></A><BR><BR>Having got his army together, and encamped near Corduba, he made 
<A NAME="931"></A>a speech to the soldiers, wherein he acquainted them with the orders he 
<A NAME="932"></A>had received from Caesar and promised them a hundred sesterces each, when 
<A NAME="933"></A>they should arrive in Mauritania: the fifth legion, he told them, was to 
<A NAME="934"></A>remain in Spain. Having ended his speech, he returned to Corduba. The same 
<A NAME="935"></A>day, about noon, as he went to the hall of justice, one Minutius Silo, 
<A NAME="936"></A>a client of L. Racilius, presented him with a paper, in a soldier's habit, 
<A NAME="937"></A>as if he had some request to make. Then retiring behind Racilius (who walked 
<A NAME="938"></A>beside Cassius), as if waiting for an answer, he gradually drew near, and 
<A NAME="939"></A>a favorable opportunity offering, seized Cassius with his left hand, and 
<A NAME="940"></A>wounded him twice with a dagger in his right. A shout was then raised and 
<A NAME="941"></A>an attack made on him by the rest of the conspirators, who all rushed upon 
<A NAME="942"></A>him in a body. Munatius Plancus killed the lictor, that was next Longinus; 
<A NAME="943"></A>and wounded Q. Cassius his lieutenant. T. Vasius and L. Mergilio seconded 
<A NAME="944"></A>their countryman Plancus; for they were all natives of Italica. L. Licinius 
<A NAME="945"></A>Squillus flew upon Longinus himself, and gave him several slight wounds 
<A NAME="946"></A>as he lay upon the ground.
<A NAME="947"></A><BR><BR>Chapter 53
<A NAME="948"></A><BR><BR>By this time, his guards came up to his assistance (for he always 
<A NAME="949"></A>had several beronians and veterans, armed with darts, to attend him), and 
<A NAME="950"></A>surrounded the rest of the conspirators, who were advancing to complete 
<A NAME="951"></A>the assassination. Of this number were Calphurnius Salvianus and Manilius 
<A NAME="952"></A>Tusculus. Cassius was carried home; and Minutius Silo, stumbling upon a 
<A NAME="953"></A>stone, as he endeavored to make his escape, was taken, and brought to him. 
<A NAME="954"></A>Racilius retired to the neighboring house of a friend, till he should have 
<A NAME="955"></A>certain in formation of the fate of Cassius. L. Laterensis, not doubting 
<A NAME="956"></A>but he was dispatched, ran in a transport of joy to the camp, to congratulate 
<A NAME="957"></A>the second and the new-raised legions upon it, who, he knew, bore a particular 
<A NAME="958"></A>hatred to Cassius; and who, immediately upon this intelligence, placed 
<A NAME="959"></A>him on the tribunal, and proclaimed him praetor. For there was not a native 
<A NAME="960"></A>of the province, nor a soldier of the newly-raised legion, nor a person 
<A NAME="961"></A>who by long residence was naturalized in the province, of which class the 
<A NAME="962"></A>second legion consisted, who did not join in the general hatred of 
<A NAME="963"></A>Cassius.
<A NAME="964"></A><BR><BR>Chapter 54
<A NAME="965"></A><BR><BR>Meantime Laterensis was informed that Cassius was still alive; 
<A NAME="966"></A>at which, being rather grieved than disconcerted, he immediately so far 
<A NAME="967"></A>recovered himself, as to go and wait upon him. By this time, the thirtieth 
<A NAME="968"></A>legion having notice of what had passed, had marched to Corduba, to the 
<A NAME="969"></A>assistance of their general. The twenty-first and fifth followed their 
<A NAME="970"></A>example. As only two legions remained in the camp, the second, fearing 
<A NAME="971"></A>they should be left alone, and their sentiments should be consequently 
<A NAME="972"></A>manifested, did the same. But the new-raised legion continued firm, nor 
<A NAME="973"></A>could be induced by any motives of fear to stir from its 
<A NAME="974"></A>place.
<A NAME="975"></A><BR><BR>Chapter 55
<A NAME="976"></A><BR><BR>Cassius ordered all the accomplices of the conspiracy to be seized, 
<A NAME="977"></A>and sent back the fifth legion to the camp, retaining the other three. 
<A NAME="978"></A>By the confession of Minutius, he learned, that L. Racilius, L. Laterensis, 
<A NAME="979"></A>and Annius Scapula, man of great authority and credit in the province, 
<A NAME="980"></A>and equally in his confidence with Laterensis and Racilius, were concerned 
<A NAME="981"></A>in the plot: nor did he long defer his revenge, but ordered them to be 
<A NAME="982"></A>put to death. He delivered Minutius to be racked by his freed-men; likewise 
<A NAME="983"></A>Calphurnius Salvianus; who, turning evidence, increased the number of the 
<A NAME="984"></A>conspirators; justly, as some think; but others pretend that he was forced. 
<A NAME="985"></A>L. Mergilio was likewise put to the torture. Squillus impeached many others, 
<A NAME="986"></A>who were all condemned to die, except such as redeemed their lives by a 
<A NAME="987"></A>fine; for he pardoned Calphurnius for ten, and Q. Sextius for fifty thousand 
<A NAME="988"></A>sesterces, who, though deeply guilty, yet having, in this manner, escaped 
<A NAME="989"></A>death, showed Cassius to be no less covetous than cruel.
<A NAME="990"></A><BR><BR>Chapter 56
<A NAME="991"></A><BR><BR>Some days after, he received letters from Caesar, by which he learned 
<A NAME="992"></A>that Pompey was defeated, and had fled with the loss of all his troops, 
<A NAME="993"></A>which news equally affected him with joy and sorrow. Caesar's success gave 
<A NAME="994"></A>him pleasure; but the conclusion of the war would put an end to his rapines: 
<A NAME="995"></A>insomuch, that he was uncertain which to wish for, victory or an unbounded 
<A NAME="996"></A>licentiousness. When he was cured of his wounds, he sent to all who were 
<A NAME="997"></A>indebted to him, in any sums, and insisted upon immediate payment. Such 
<A NAME="998"></A>as were taxed too low, had orders to furnish larger sums. He likewise instituted 
<A NAME="999"></A>a levy of Roman citizens, and as they were enrolled from all the corporations 
<A NAME="1000"></A>and colonies, and were terrified by service beyond the sea, he called upon 
<A NAME="1001"></A>them to redeem themselves from the military oath. This brought in vast 
<A NAME="1002"></A>revenue, but greatly increased the general hatred. He afterward reviewed 
<A NAME="1003"></A>the army, sent the legions and auxiliaries, designed for Africa, toward 
<A NAME="1004"></A>the straits of Gibraltar, and went himself to Seville, to examine the condition 
<A NAME="1005"></A>of the fleet. He staid there some time, in consequence of an edict he had 
<A NAME="1006"></A>published, ordering all who had not paid the sums in which they were amerced, 
<A NAME="1007"></A>to repair to him thither; which created a universal murmuring and 
<A NAME="1008"></A>discontent.
<A NAME="1009"></A><BR><BR>Chapter 57
<A NAME="1010"></A><BR><BR>In the mean time, L. Titius, a military tribune of the native legion, 
<A NAME="1011"></A>sent him notice of a report that the thirteenth legion, which Q. Cassius 
<A NAME="1012"></A>his lieutenant was taking with him, when it was encamped at Ilurgis, had 
<A NAME="1013"></A>mutinied and killed some of the centurions that opposed them, and were 
<A NAME="1014"></A>gone over to the second legion, who marched another way toward the Straits. 
<A NAME="1015"></A>Upon this intelligence he set out by night with five cohorts of the twenty-first 
<A NAME="1016"></A>legion, and came up with them in the morning. He staid there that day to 
<A NAME="1017"></A>consult what was proper to be done, and then went to Carmona, where he 
<A NAME="1018"></A>found the thirtieth and twenty-first legions, with four cohorts of the 
<A NAME="1019"></A>fifth, and all the cavalry assembled. Here he learned that the new-raised 
<A NAME="1020"></A>legion had surprised four cohorts, near Obucula, and forced them along 
<A NAME="1021"></A>with them to the second legion, where all joining, they had chosen T. Thorius, 
<A NAME="1022"></A>a native of Italica, for their general. Having instantly called a council, 
<A NAME="1023"></A>he sent Marcellus to Corduba to secure that town, and Q. Cassius, his lieutenant, 
<A NAME="1024"></A>to Seville. A few days after, news was brought that the Roman citizens 
<A NAME="1025"></A>at Corduba had revolted, and that Marcellus, either voluntarily or through 
<A NAME="1026"></A>force (for the reports were various), had joined them; as likewise the 
<A NAME="1027"></A>two cohorts of the fifth legion that were in garrison there. Cassius, provoked 
<A NAME="1028"></A>at these mutinies, decamped, and the next day came to Segovia, upon the 
<A NAME="1029"></A>river Xenil. There, summoning an assembly, to sound the disposition of 
<A NAME="1030"></A>the troops, he found that it was not out of any regard to him, but to Caesar, 
<A NAME="1031"></A>though absent, that they continued faithful, and were ready to undergo 
<A NAME="1032"></A>any danger for the, recovery of the province.
<A NAME="1033"></A><BR><BR>Chapter 58
<A NAME="1034"></A><BR><BR>Meantime Thorius marched the veteran legions to Corduba; and, that 
<A NAME="1035"></A>the revolt might not appear to spring from a seditious inclination in him 
<A NAME="1036"></A>or the soldiers, as likewise to oppose an equal authority to that of Q. 
<A NAME="1037"></A>Cassius, who was drawing together a great force in Caesar's name; he publicly 
<A NAME="1038"></A>gave out that his design was to recover the province for Pompey; and perhaps 
<A NAME="1039"></A>he did this through hatred of Caesar, and love of Pompey, whose name was 
<A NAME="1040"></A>very powerful among those legions which M. Varro had commanded. Be this 
<A NAME="1041"></A>as it will, Thorius at least made it his pretense; and the soldiers were 
<A NAME="1042"></A>so infatuated with the thought, that they had Pompey's name inscribed upon 
<A NAME="1043"></A>their bucklers. The citizens of Corduba, men, women, and children, came 
<A NAME="1044"></A>out to meet the legions, begging "they would not enter Corduba as enemies, 
<A NAME="1045"></A>seeing they joined with them in their aversion to Cassius, and only desired 
<A NAME="1046"></A>they might not be obliged to act against Caesar."
<A NAME="1047"></A><BR><BR>Chapter 59
<A NAME="1048"></A><BR><BR>The soldiers, moved by the prayers and tears of so great a multitude, 
<A NAME="1049"></A>and seeing they stood in no need of Pompey's name and memory to spirit 
<A NAME="1050"></A>up a revolt against Cassius, and that he was as much hated by Caesar's 
<A NAME="1051"></A>followers as Pompey's; neither being able to prevail with Marcellus or 
<A NAME="1052"></A>the people of Corduba to declare against Caesar, they erased Pompey's name 
<A NAME="1053"></A>from their bucklers, chose Marcellus their commander, called him praetor, 
<A NAME="1054"></A>joined the citizens of Corduba, and encamped near the town. Two days after, 
<A NAME="1055"></A>Cassius encamped on an eminence, on this side the Guadalquivir, about four 
<A NAME="1056"></A>miles from Corduba, and within view of the town; whence he sent letters 
<A NAME="1057"></A>to Bogud, in Mauritania, and M. Lepidus, proconsul of Hither Spain, to 
<A NAME="1058"></A>come to his assistance as soon as possible, for Caesar's sake. Meanwhile 
<A NAME="1059"></A>he ravaged the country, and set fire to the buildings around 
<A NAME="1060"></A>Corduba.
<A NAME="1061"></A><BR><BR>Chapter 60
<A NAME="1062"></A><BR><BR>The legions under Marcellus, provoked at this indignity, ran to 
<A NAME="1063"></A>him, and begged to be led against the enemy, that they might have an opportunity 
<A NAME="1064"></A>of engaging with them before they could have time to destroy with fire 
<A NAME="1065"></A>and sword the rich and noble possessions of the inhabitants of Corduba. 
<A NAME="1066"></A>Marcellus, though averse to a battle, which, whoever was victorious, must 
<A NAME="1067"></A>turn to Caesar's detriment, yet unable to restrain the legions, led them 
<A NAME="1068"></A>across the Guadalquivir, and drew them up. Cassius did the same upon a 
<A NAME="1069"></A>rising ground, but as he would not quit his advantageous post, Marcellus 
<A NAME="1070"></A>persuaded his men to return to their camp. He had already begun to retire 
<A NAME="1071"></A>when Cassius, knowing himself to be stronger in cavalry, fell upon the 
<A NAME="1072"></A>legionaries with his horse, and made a considerable slaughter in their 
<A NAME="1073"></A>rear upon the banks of the river. When it was evident from this loss, that 
<A NAME="1074"></A>crossing the river was an error and attended with great loss, Marcellus 
<A NAME="1075"></A>removed his camp to the other side of the Guadalquivir, where both armies 
<A NAME="1076"></A>frequently drew up, but did not engage, on account of the inequality of 
<A NAME="1077"></A>the ground.
<A NAME="1078"></A><BR><BR>Chapter 61
<A NAME="1079"></A><BR><BR>Marcellus was stronger in foot, for he commanded veteran soldiers 
<A NAME="1080"></A>of great experience in war. Cassius depended more on the fidelity than 
<A NAME="1081"></A>the courage of his troops. The two camps being very near each other, Marcellus 
<A NAME="1082"></A>seized a spot of ground, where he built a fort, very convenient for depriving 
<A NAME="1083"></A>the enemy of water. Longinus, apprehending he should be besieged in a country 
<A NAME="1084"></A>where all were against him, quitted his camp silently in the night, and, 
<A NAME="1085"></A>by a quick march, reached Ulia, a town on which he thought he could rely. 
<A NAME="1086"></A>There he encamped so near the walls, that both by the situation of the 
<A NAME="1087"></A>place (for Ulia stands on an eminence), and the defenses of the town, he 
<A NAME="1088"></A>was on all sides secure from an attack. Marcellus followed him and encamped 
<A NAME="1089"></A>as near the town as possible. Having taken a view of the place he found 
<A NAME="1090"></A>himself reduced, by necessity, to do what was most agreeable to his own 
<A NAME="1091"></A>inclination; namely, neither to engage Cassius, which the ardor of his 
<A NAME="1092"></A>soldiers would have forced him to, had it been possible, nor to suffer 
<A NAME="1093"></A>him, by his excursions, to infest the territories of other states, as he 
<A NAME="1094"></A>had done those of Corduba. He therefore raised redoubts in proper places, 
<A NAME="1095"></A>and continued his works quite round the town, inclosing both Ulia and Cassius 
<A NAME="1096"></A>within his lines. But before they were finished, Cassius sent out all his 
<A NAME="1097"></A>cavalry, who he imagined might do him great service by cutting off Marcellus's 
<A NAME="1098"></A>provisions and forage, and could only be a useless encumbrance to him, 
<A NAME="1099"></A>by consuming his provisions if he was shut up in his 
<A NAME="1100"></A>camp.
<A NAME="1101"></A><BR><BR>Chapter 62
<A NAME="1102"></A><BR><BR>A few days after, king Bogud, having received Cassius's letters, 
<A NAME="1103"></A>came and joined him with all his forces, consisting of one legion, and 
<A NAME="1104"></A>several auxiliary cohorts. For as commonly happens in civil dissensions, 
<A NAME="1105"></A>some of the states of Spain at that time favored Cassius, but a yet greater 
<A NAME="1106"></A>number, Marcellus. Bogud came up to the advanced works of Marcellus, where 
<A NAME="1107"></A>many sharp skirmishes happened with various success: however, Marcellus 
<A NAME="1108"></A>still kept possession of his works.
<A NAME="1109"></A><BR><BR>Chapter 63
<A NAME="1110"></A><BR><BR>Meanwhile Lepidus came to Ulia, from the hither province, with 
<A NAME="1111"></A>thirty-five legionary cohorts, and a great body of horse and auxiliaries, 
<A NAME="1112"></A>with the intention of adjusting the differences between Cassius and Marcellus. 
<A NAME="1113"></A>Marcellus submitted without hesitation: but Cassius kept within his works, 
<A NAME="1114"></A>either because he thought his cause the justest, or from an apprehension 
<A NAME="1115"></A>that his adversary's submission had prepossessed Lepidus in his favor. 
<A NAME="1116"></A>Lepidus encamped at Ulia, and forming a complete junction with Marcellus, 
<A NAME="1117"></A>prevented a battle, invited Cassius into his camp, and pledged his honor 
<A NAME="1118"></A>to act without prejudice. Cassius hesitated long, but at last desired that 
<A NAME="1119"></A>the circumvallation should be leveled, and free egress given him. The truce 
<A NAME="1120"></A>was not only concluded, but the works demolished, and the guards drawn 
<A NAME="1121"></A>off; when king Bogud attacked one of Marcellus's forts, that lay nearest 
<A NAME="1122"></A>to his camp, unknown to any (except perhaps Longinus, who was not exempt 
<A NAME="1123"></A>from suspicion on this occasion), and slew a great number of his men. And
